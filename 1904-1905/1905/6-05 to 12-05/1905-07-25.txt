Dire Predictions by

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HOBOKEN. N. J.. July 24.â Professor
Gustave Meyer of Hoboken, the "na
tion's counselor," is predicting: all sorts
of dire things at borne and abroad,
from hot weather and earthquakes to
an accident to President Roosevelt, all
of which, however, the astrologer hopes
may not prove true. This is what he
has to say:
"As a young American astrologer
I wish to state that great and destruc
tive electrical storms or atmospheric
disturbances will occur on the 25th
and 2sth inst. and that it will be high
ly advisable for all seafaring vessels
lo remain in port and for all those
who intend to go down to the sea in
ships to postpone their voyage on these
dates and I then have confidence that
much loss of life and property can be
saved.
"I wish it to be distinctly understood
that this weather report is positively
tinomcla.l, ' as it is â¢ purely â¢ .astrological. -
M I have no connection with the
United States Weather Bureau. J might
add, in passing, that we will have sum
mer this year way into November and
that the month of August will prove
to be one of the hottest months on rec
ord and as a result the mortality will
be unusually large and remarkable de
structions by fatal electric storms and
atmospheric disturbances will be much
in evidence and will cause* great loss
of life and property throughout the
Kast and the West in particular.
"Further speaking of coming events,
I find that the starry messengers sig
nify and impart to me the fact that
during the autumn months Russia will
be quite unfortunate and will continue
in warfare until the new year. Then
Khe will experience relief from her
troubles, both internal and external,
and the birth of a new republic will
occur in liussla.
"During October great earthquakes
will visit Japan and swallow up hun
dreds of Japanese, and will seriously
affect New York and I fear that the
Brooklyn bridge will be in great dan
ger of being consumed by electricity
and great calamities will occur in
mines and underground amusement
places and we shall hear of the fall
of a public building. Therefore it
would be well for all building inspec
tors to be more cautious than usual.
"Speaking of Broadway in New York,
I find that the birth of theÂ»subway oc
curred in an evil hour and that great
calamities are indicated to occur in the
subway during August and October,
and I fear that the waters of j. he Hud
son" will rush in.
"I would advise both the authorities
of the Brooklyn bridge and the subway
to be more cautious than usual.
"In conclusion I will state that the
greatest danger of earthquake and
calamities to the Brooklyn bridge, as
mentioned, I fear will occur on October
K. On that date, I might also add, I
fear that the life of President Roose
ve2t will be In jeopardy and that he
will be in very great danger of meet
ing with a serious and peculiar if not
fatal accident to his knees! similar to
If not worse than that which I pre
dicted for him In his Pittsfleld, Mass.,
trolley mishap. I would adviso Presi
dent Roosevelt to remain as quiet as
possible and to be more cautious than
usual on October 8.
"During October and November Eng
land will be quite unfortunate and I
fear she will experience much trouble
relati\-e to uprisings in India, which, I
Judge, will last for a period of seven
years. Therefore It would be well for
the English Government to be well pre
pared for war.
â¢ "England will yet prove to be one of
the most sincere friends to the United
States of all the nations on Mother
Earth." . . .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 24.â Expressing deep
indignation that the purity of the mo
tives of Town ToDies should be ques
tioned; Colonel W. D. Mann, chief owner
and editor of that publication, talked
freely on his arrival from'EuroDe to
night. He said he was ready to meet
the District Attorney or anybody else
at any time; that he had nothing to con
ceal or excuse, so far as he personally
was concerned, and he ; promised to aid
In the prosecution of connected
directly or indirectly with Town Topics
who might have been guilty of black
mail. Said* he: : - ;j>
"No article has ever been .withheld
from publication In Town Topics nor has
anything been printed in Town Topics for,
a consideration, with my knowledge or
consent,
"As to 'America's Smart Set,* "'Colonel'
Mann said he never heard of 'such- a
publication. nor. of JthevSociety : Editors'^
Association.. â¢ \u25a0*\u2666..-- - ,
' "If . the name of Town Topics was used
through the means of one of the paper's
letterheads to obtain subscriptions . for.
any such publication there has been a
gross violation of ethics and, perhaps, of
the law," he "said.
Concerning Judge Deuel's connection
with Town Topics, Colonel Matin was
; more reticent. Praising Judge Deuel as
one of the best jurists In the city and
as a man above reproach in all respects,
Colonel Manri said that he had too great
respect for his legal ability to question
the Judge's standing before the law. for
anything he had done for Town Topics.
The colonel was highly indignant at re
ports that such men as Charles M.
Schwab and R. Fulton Cutting had paid
large amounts to suppress stories con
cerning themselves In Town Topics.
While Colonel Mann said he had not
heard of "America's Smart Set," he ad
mitted that Town Topics was responsible
for "Fads and Fancies" and "is proud
of it."
"'Fads and Fancies' is the most per
fect piece of book making In the world,"
he said. "What the.different people paid
for copies I do noi recall. I will say that
if Mrs. Collis P. Kuntlngton paid $10,000
she paid too much. These are details I
could not be expected to be familiar with,
considering my many other duties."
Colonel Mann expressed surprise that
"Fads and Fancies" had not been pub
lished, as It was almost ready for de
livery, he said, when' he sailed.
Concerning the denial from Oyster Bay
that President Roosevelt had consented
to accent a presentation copy of "Fads
and Fancies." Colonel Mann said it must
have slipped the President's mind, which
was not remarkable, considering his
manifold duties. He maintained, how
ever, that three years ago tue matter
was laid before the President and that
Town Topics was supplied with a photo
graph and a sketch of the Presldent:-

Lar Man.
Gonrt Holds the g
Woman Was
Sane.
The cloud surrounding the last testa
ment of Harry Floyd-Gopcevic. the San
Francisco girl who surprised society by
marrying a streetcar conductor \u25a0 who
rang up fares on the line that passed
her home on Sacramento street, has been
entirely swept away by a decision . hand
ed down yesterday by Judge M. S.'Sayro
of Lakeport. who holds that her final
will bequeathing the million dollar estate
to her husband shall stand unscatched
by .the bitter attack made upon it. But
this decision means far more than mere
ly that the money shall go to Mllos Mltroy
Gopcevlc for once and all; it means that
the memory of this dearly , loved girl ts
cleared of the terrible charges of in
sanity, of being under the hypnotic in
fluence of her most Intimate friend, Eliza
Prlchard, and of being duped by a mero
fortune hunter. Judge Sayre makes it a
point in his decision to faithfully dispel
all of these accusing theories.
The memory -of Harry Floyd, as she
was best ' known in this city, is cleared
of all these charges. Her marriage with
Mllos Gopcevtc reads clear with all the
sweet romance attached to It that this
girl must have . felt when she secretly
allowed the street car. conductor to court
her : and than, one day. without the
knowledge of her relatives, ,when she"
gave up to his ardent pleadings and
yielded herself to.be -led away to the
altar, ' that day . the happiest girl in San
Francisco.
BEQUEATHS ALIjTO HER HUSBAND.
â¢^ Tnen-CTm9ther*trafof tun^te" "death.^ Be-"
fore she' breathed her last she asked for
pen and paper and with her own hand
she '.wrote ~her : will. ' bequeathing almost
all to her husband, whom she still loved
with, a passion- that had lived unabated
since the day. that she plighted her secret
troth to him.
\u25a0Immediately after the death of Harry
Floyd-Gopcevic a contest of the will was
instituted by Mrs. L. L. . Matthews, iMrs.
J. Lt Humes and Mrs. M, F. 4 , McAdoo. who
claimed that she was not competent to
make a. will, and that she had been un
duly Influenced by, Miss Eliza Prichard, a
girl whose companionship was one of tho
dearest possessions of the young heiress,
her. husbaKQ and his brother. Petar Gop
cevlc, all of whom helped persuade her, It
was alleged, to leave the vast estate to
Milos. the man of her choice. But by tho
decision of Judge Sayre the act of the
woman is upheld and the contestants de
feated.
The most interesting feature of the
trial was the testimony adduced to show
the habit which Harry Floyd had of im
personating many of the romantic char
acters she had read about. - These were,
male or female, as the case might be. and
when so costumed she wpuld move and
act in an atmosphere like that in which
she could imagine that these phantom
people really walked. Dumas' Raoul de
Bragelonhe in the Three Musketeers,, as
well as the Comtc de la Fere and other
imaginary personages, were her favorites,
and for hours she would revel in tha
happy Imaginings that her sensitive mind
made real to her. The contestants tried -
to show that she went so far In theso
impersonations that she really lost con
trol cf her mind, and that she was really,
mentally unbalanced during these periods.'
but the testimony proved that these wero
merely the pleasant pastimes of a clever
and innocent sirl.
HARRIED LIFE HAPPY.

with the streetcar conductor were found
to have been of the happiest nature. In
a letter to her dear friend. Henry E.
Matthews, produced in court, she' tells
him of her intended marriage wiih Gop*

saw would be enacted by her relatives
when they learned of the secret wedding.
Speaking of her new company, she wrote:
"He isn't so very new, though, for I
found cut quite a time ago that he is the
dearest boy In the world. lam not quick
to care for people, as you know, but when
I do I have reason to. and mostly I con

needn't say "boo* for a day or " two, but
there is going to \u25a0be a wedding around
here shortly, for Milos and I have de

SITUATION VIS NOVEL
Berlin /Would Welcome "an
Understandiiiii- With the
Government'" in Paris
LONDON, July 24.â From a high official
cf the Foreign Office a press correspond
ent obtained an interesting statement of
the relations between Grfat Britain,
France and Germany. Beginning with
the declaration that Great Britain would
velcome a defensive alliance with
France, because it would insure a long
continuance of European peace by acting
as a check to Gorman .ambitions, the
official tsaid the charge made in the Ger
man press against Great Britain, of seek
ing tt> involve France In a- war with
Germany, whs absolutely contrary to the
facts. He said:
France certainly Is net det-iioue of war with
Genv.any. boJ if Great Britain, as *!legod,
iirged Fra.r.t-*- to f.ght, the French Government
snd prise woula not now display that frlendli-
DfFs towar.l us which is apparent on all eides.
When Germany created ihe controversy with
J"raru-e o-.-c-r Morocco the British Government
informed thr French Government that it would
support U in whatever policy it decided to
pursue. Accordingly. Grwt Britain declined to
rartlcipase In thÂ»- international . conference
when France declined, and accepted when
Franc-e reconsidered its decision; but any
Â«fcar{u- that we sought to bring about war or
failed to Us=Â«- our good offices to prevent a con
flict it- tbpoiulely false. "We would undoubt
edly have stood by France in any conflict, and
â¢w*- desire an understanding with France solely
to im-ure ;)â¢ ace.
Great Britain in war would suffer infinitely
grrater commercial tOMWI than her adversary.
For one ihinp. our entire snipping would go to
Anu-rica. and 'he people would overthrow any
government assuming an aggressive attitude.
Regarding the diplomatic relations be
tween German;' and Great Britain the.
prwsÂ» was informed that they' were not In
the ieast strained and that there never
had been- any .serious difficulties between
the two Governments.
It has always been considered here that
Germany's attack on the French Moroc
can policy dealt directly with the Anglo-
French entf-nte. while *ell founded opln- j
ions have been expressed that Germany ;
\u25a0would welcome an understanding â¢ with '
France on Far Eastern matters. In- which,
the Interests of the two countries' are?
similar. - -.'â¢\u25a0\u25a0'.* r 1
It would seem that France, Instead of
occupying a begging' role, is the fortunate
possessor of two suitors in the greatest
rivals in Europe. \u25a0 t * \u25a0
EXCITIXG SCEXE â¢
IX THE CO3IMOXS
Opposition Leaders Denounce
Premier Balfour as
"Contemptible."
LONDON. July 24.â The' Government
has no intention of resigning: In conse
quence of Thursday's adverse vote. This
was _xhe- cist of Premier Balfour's state
ment in the House of Commons this
morning. While it was generally, rec
ognized that such would be the decision
of the Premier, there was feverish
eagerness oir all sides to hear the exact
tt rms of hie statement. \u25a0 The House was
littrally packed. Every gallery available
to the peers and the public was crowded
and there had not been such an attend
ance of members during the life of the
present Parliament.
BalfoUr, who was heartily cheered by his
supporters on rising, tried the patience of
hii; hearers somewhat by a long dis
quisition on how former administrations
had ignored defeat similar to that on
Thursday. He declared that such in
cidents had never been regarded as
ground for resignation or dissolution and
announced that the Government did not
propose either to resign or dissolve Parlia
ment because of Thursday's occurrence.
The Premier considered that It would
be a grave evil if the. tenure of the
Ministers were made dependent on such
votes as that of Thursday. He hoped
the practice would never prevail of allow
ing a government, united in itself and
possessing the confidence of the majority
of the House, to abandon -its post -in
consequence of such a vote.
Balfour sat down without referring to
the remaining business of the session and
Sir Henry Campbell-Barinerman, the LI
beral leader, immediately asked for an
opportunity to discuss the Premier's
statement. Sir Edward Grey proposed
a vote of censure, John Redmond, the
leader of the Irish Nationalists, took a
Eimilar line and the heated tone of both
leaders indicated that the Government
would have to face determined 'opposi
tion during the remainder of the ses
sion.
Ultimately, by arrangement with Bal
four. the chief whip. Sir Alexander
Hood, formally moved the adjournment
and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
opened the debate with a stirring attack
on the Government.
Redmond followed and characterized
the Premier's action as contemptible. The
opposition, he declared; ought to band to
gether and make the continued life of
this Government impossible.
Speaking for the Nationalists, Redmond
promised the Government that they
would neither ask nor give quarter, but
would fight day and night, co as to make
ehort work of "This Government of
ehreds and patches."
The opposition, \u25a0 for tactical reasons,
deciding to abstain from a division, the
<lebate in the House was unexpectedly
ended and the Government motion for an
adjournment was carried wlth"out" a di
vision. \u25a0
It is estimated that had a division
taken place the Government would
have had a majority of from 90 to 100.
Several Conservatives made their first
appearance In the House this year.

Immense Pumps Suck Water From Holds of
Ship and Clear Way for Investigators.
Failure of Iris to Arrive From Mare
Island Delays Official Action.
BAST DIEGO, July 24UÂ£4<Bte this af
ternoon the tucs Fortune and Santa Fe
â¢ueeeeded in pantos' the Bennlnifton
off the beach upon which she was run
immediately after the accident and
toned her to the Santa Fe wharf, where
*>he Im tied up, pending: repaim to en
able her to proceed to Mare Inland,
Â»hould italic- be practicable.
SAN* DIEGO. July 24.â Shocking and pa
thetic as have been the occurrences ac
companying and following the explosion
on the United States gunboat Benning
ton in San Diego harbor, the story of the
frightful accident has reached the point
where the strain of suspense may give
place to the belief of knowing that the
extent of the disaster has been defined.
The most important development of to
day in this sad affair is the certainty
that no member of the crew of the Ben
ningfrn remains unaccounted for, and
that no grewsome find awaits the ex
ploration of the depths of the hold now
being rapidly emptied of water.
The summary of the situation early
this morning was: Fifty-four identified
dead, four unidentified dead, forty-six
wounded, one missing, ninety uninjured
and one, deserter. This brings the total
up to that of the number of the officers
and crew â 137.
Inquiries of the representative of the
Associated Press on board the Bennington
this morning resulted In the location of
the last man whose name appeared In
the list of missing, C. A. Mumper, who
Is found to be alive and uninjured.
Moreover, this morning's investigations
have resulted in definitely establishing
the Identity of the four men classed as
unidentified dead. These are C. Nelson,
C. S. Carter. P. Strang and R. J. Olges.
A visit to the hospitals where the in
jured survivors are being cared for
gives a hopeful aspect to the present
situation, compared with what it was
yesterday. There are seven poor fel
lows whose fate may be said to hang
In the balance, and one of them at this
hour shows a decided tendency toward
recovery. Those in a critical condition
are W. V. Kennedy, George Hallett, C.
Bchlatz, H. A. Mettles, S. Pakate, L. A.
Griese, Walter Martin.
Of these Walter Martin this morning
was at a critical point, with tempera
ture at 104. A turn for the better, with
reduced temperature, followed the
dressing of his -wounds. The* one now
most seriously ill is LA. Grlese, who
r to-day shows pneumonia symptoms.
Martin may recover, but any of the
others may die at any hour.
Xo more of the injured have died up
to 11:30 oclock to-night, although sev
eral are not expected to last many
hours longer.
The pumps have got practically all
the water out of the Bennington and
it was not found a difficult matter to
get her off the, mud. and, here to. the
wharf. Her bow is -faefnk,' to the .west
and at that point there Js. twenty-six <
feet of water. The depth at the stern
is twenty-two feet. The vessel itself Is
now drawing nineteen and a half feet.
The Interior of the vessel now pre
sents a less disordered appearance.
Boiler "B.V which exploded , first. Is
seen to have moved fifteen feet aft, and
the two boilers are jammed against the
steel bulkhead. In the starboard store
room is the mass of water-soaked and
ruined ships' goods, which may now be
taken out as soon as the arrival of the
Iris from San Francisco shall provide J
a place where what is good of It may)
be stored. A board has been appointed, j
consisting of Commander Young and ,
Lieutenants Yates and Wade, to attend j
to the work of condemning the stores. (
The condition In the engine-room Is
such that It will probably take two
days to discover the full amount of the
damage done there.
The name of the deserter has been
ascertained to be Grove, a San Diego
boy, who" left the ship the "night before
the explosion, arid who, had he been
aboard, would have been with those
who were instantly killed.
The funeral of Ensign Perry will be
held on Friday at St. Paul's Episcopal
Church. It will be of a military char

Captain F. J. Drake is now anxiously
awaiting the arrival of the Iris from
Mare Island. He said that she should
have been here before this and that he
has wired to Mare Island and also to
the Secretary of the Navy asking about
the delay in the arrival.
The Iris has on board the divers and
diving outfits and as soon as she gets
here the work along the bottom of the
Bennlngton will be carried on. Fur
thermore all the stores, equipment, in
cluding the ammunition and batteries,
with the exception of the main battery
guns and the mounts, -will be put on the
Iris. The Idea Is to lighten the Ben
nington so that sufficient repairs can
be made to tow the vessel to Mare
Island. The stores and equipment are
now being assembled on the upper deck
so that they can be transferred as soon
as the iris gets here.
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.
Secretary Bonaparte Determined to
Probe Bennington Disaster.
WASHINGTON, D. C. July 24.âSec
retary Bonaparte in a statement issued
to-day said the public may rest assured
that the Bennington disaster will be
thoroughly Investigated and that what
ever action, the results of the Investi
gation may show to be proper will be
taken by the department promptly and
effectually.
Secretary. Bonaparte showed the deep
interest he has taken in the Benning
ton disaster by immediately taking up
the subject on his return to-day.' He
held an extended conference with As
sistant Secretary Darling and found
that Mr. Darling had done everything
possible to alleviate the sufferings of
the wounded and for the proper care of
the dead, as well as to lay the foun
dation for an Investigation of the ex
plosion. When advised that Rear Ad
miral Goodrich had been ordered to
San Diego the Secretary asked as to
the number of officers that' would be
available upon the admiral's arrival
from which) a proper investigating body
could be convened. The Secretary A was
assured that with* the officers on the
ground and those who will come with
the flagship Chicago and the supply
ship Iris there will be ample material
for a board or for a court of Inquiry.
The Secretary expects a most thorough
investigation. \u25a0! '
When Admiral Goodrich reaches San
Diego all facts developed pending his
arrival will be reported to him and it is
expected that the board which Captain
Drake ordered, to determine the extent
of the damage to the hull and engines
also will report their results of their
Investigation- to the admiral. Admiral
Goodrich then can determine the steps
to be taken, but it was made manifest
to-day that Mr. Bonaparte expects the
inquiry to be exhaustive and such as
will develop every possible-fact.
It was suggested at the department
to-day that some of - the . steam engi
neering records of the Bennington' may.
have been destroyed when the ship' was
blown up. The quarterly report cover
ing the period from March' 30 to: June
30 had not been received at the Bureau
of Steam Engineering up to the hour
of closing to-day. It is probable, \ it *Is
stated, that the â¢ mailing of ' the â¢ report
may have been delayed and that It was
aboard ship atthe time of the explo
sion- ' \u25a0 \u25a0.'\u25a0 -'. "\u25a0 - .. '\u0084 V- ;:.'''.'. \u25a0', *.';
The department to-day telegraphed
to Captain Drake for. a list of surviv
ors. This was done because of the nu
merous inquiries i that have come , from
relatives of, the sailors who have not
been reported* among the dead or in
jured. " The department \u25a0; has v directed

UNIQUE PLEA OF AUTHOR
He Thinks Too Mucli Is Made
iof Past Novelists, to the
Injury of Modern Writers
; LONDON, â¢ July 24.â John Bunyan
wouldn't recognize his own "Pilgrim" or
his ; "Progress" . either after certain
changes which that famous character, and
his \u25a0 adventures have been undergoing
lately. The Religious , Tract Society,
which j distributes reading matter among
natives the world over, has been adapt
ing Bunyan's famous work for under
standing *by the Matabeles of South
Africa, and. a truly startling transforma
tion is the- result. \ '.
i Instead of - wearing the armor of a
knight of the middle ages Christian has
become a poor Kaffir, armed with a knob
kerry, shield and assegl. He sets out
from a native kraal, which takes the place
of the City of Destruction; the Slough of
Despond is a mud hole in the veldt, while
Evangelist Is represented by an English
missionary. One might have thought that
to -provide'* a South African substitute for
Vanity Fair would have stumped the
adapter, but it didn't, ; for he has , made
It a war dance festival. ; Finally, Demas
is ' pictured , as trying to tempt Christian
and Hopeful "to enter a gold mine.
PLEA FORMODER.V AUTHORS.
Is too much space devoted* to Dickens,
Thackeray, | Lamb and their contempor
aries? R. S. Warren Bell, who wrote
"Bachelorland" and "The Cub In Love"
thinks that there Is. In a letter \to a
literary journal, Mr., Bell maintains that
these authors have had their day, where
as hundreds of modern writers are rap
ping at -the editorial doors and asking
for notice.
. "Dickens and Thackeray wrote su
premely; well for their own generation,"
says Warren Bell, "but do not present
day authors cater witlv equal skill for
theirs? Let the 1 precious literary circle
stifle that hysterical shriek of Joy with
which they greet a hitherto unpublished
letter by Mrs. Carlyle. When do we not
live in fear of being threatened with an
other issue of Lamb volumes edited by
some bright young humorist? It Is the
province of some people to edit and of
others to create." When I find one of the
latter usurping the functions of the f or- j
mer, I can only compare his labors to
those of a sculptor of creative genius fur
bishing up Landseer's lions In Trafalgar
Square.
"I have been spurred on to. utter this
protest by a remark recently made In my
hearing by a publisher. Said he. 'It's the
dead 'uns that pay us.' ' And the 'dead
'uns' will continue to pay better than the
Uve 'uns as long as the press goes on
devoting columns to defunct authors
which should be reserve* for the ex
ploitation of the thought and energy of
writers who are not" only alive but
hungry." '\u25a0 \ .....
After that; It seems almost presumptu
ous to remark that a Charles Dickens let
ter,: which is: to be sold in London this
month, is of- special :lhterest as an indica
tion of the excellent ; relations which
existed between the author and his va
rious publishers. This letter was written
by Dickens to F. â¢ M. ' Evans ?in March.
1553. and in the course of it the writer
said:
' I have gone through the accounts and find
them In all respects Intelligible, explicit and.
plain.; It Is Indeed a glorious balance, and
expanded my chest considerably (I don't mean
any pun), at, breakfast '.this morning. Fifteen
hundred - pounds to-dajv and .the rest on - the \u25a0
10th of April ; ; .' â¢ will suit me perfectly.

Intercourse has been one of pleasure and satis
faction to me/ and that I have been very
happy In It. I hope , we shall never terminate
our business engagements unMl that printer

PRIVILEGES FOR BARRIE.
All Americans who read "The Little
White Bird" will be Interested in hearing
that J. M. Barrle possesses a speclalkey
to Kensington Gardens, the fascinating
region in Hyde Park, which Mr.-.. Barrle
made the scene of his modern fairy story.
A 'friend of the novelist states that soon
after the. publication of ."The Little. White
Bird? it was read with delight by the late
Duke of j Cambridge, who was ranger of
Hyde Park. A. few days afterward the
Duke, , who -. was .; Queen cousin,"
sent a charming i note to Barrie express-
Ing the pleasure he had taken In the book
and enclosing a" key to the gate in Kens
ington ; Gardens opposite to-'Mr. Barries
house in* the Bayswater road. , saying he
thought It ; a : fitting gift for .. the . author
of so fascinating a work. That the pres
ent was valued is shown by the' fact that
Mr. and; Mrs. Barrie are 1 in the habit of
using the key ; and going in the gardens
on summer evenings. .
DISPUTED BIRTHPLACE.
It seems that Americans on their
travels. will do well not to depend upon
the accuracy of memorial tablets. Some
body has just discovered, ., for instance,
that ; such tablets on two different build
ings .in Paris inform the sightseer - that
he r Is' passing the house where : Moliere
was â¢ born. - One is , in .the. Rue. dv Pont
Neuf,' the other in the Rue Sauval. More
over, one inscription " declares that the
dramatist was born in 1620, the other that

TRAIL LEADS TO DENVEK
New York Prisoner Believed
to Be New Jersey Man
Who Stole Wife's Savings
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK. July 24.â After readios
a story this morning relating to the
strange disappearance of James Carter
Richards from Camden, N. J., with his
wife's savings, with the understanding
that he was going to Denver, Colo., to
operate a gold mine. Inspector Cross
announced his belief that Richards was
Frederick E. Carlton, Brooklyn's sus
pected. "Blue Beard." . ; .
Inspector Cross also said that Elenore
Vandeventer, who is in jail for having
posed for pictures used by Carlton for
various purposes, is a much more im
portant prisoner than he had believed,
and that he was confident she had been
traveling with Carlton for many years
as hie partner In his various dealings.
Concerning the information that came
to him f^rom Denver, as the result of
an Inquiry sent to the police of that
city by Mrs. Richards, of Rockaway
Beach, asking for some trace of her
husband, who had disappeared mysteri
ously with her money. Inspector Cross
said;. ,
"O course, it is impossible to say off
hand that Richards is Carlton.' I shall
have it thoroughly investigated and
learn if the woman identifies Carlton
as her husband. It will not surprise me
if she does."
\u25a0 The officials were amazed when, as
the case developed, they discovered evi
dence whicb led to the. conclusion 1 that
Carlton and the Vandeventer woman
were old accomplices, and that their in
timacy began long before Carl ton's first
known marriage, to the woman who
died a year ago of tetanus, under almost
parallel circumstances with the death
of his last wife, recently of Brooklyn.
There was clear evidence, the Inspec
tor said, that the woman had worked
with Carlton in his various schemes. It
is the belief of the officials that she
assisted him to become acquainted with
the different women who are known to
have been his victims.
It was no wonder, the inspector said,
that Elenore Vandeventer had collapsed
in the Raymond street Jail. To-day. she
became violently ' hysterical several
times and she is continually cared for
by attendants.
Report Case of Yellow FeveflW
MOBILE, Ala.. July 24.â There is a
rumor current that two of the crew of
the steamship Columbia from Colon via
Bocas del Toro, which unloaded fruit
last night, were taken oft the vessel
when she arrived inward bound at the
quarantine station, thirty miles below
Mobile. The men are reported to have
been ill with yellow fever. The Colum
bia was not allowed to coal here. Dr.
Henry Ooldthwaite, health- and execu
tive ollicer ; of the, quarantine board of
Mobile Bay, went down to -the quaran
tine station to-night but has not re
turned. It is reported one of the men
died but this lacks confirmation.
he saw the light In 1622. Oddly enough,
until a comparatively short " time ago,.
Paris contained two houses In
Moliere was said to have died. Both of
them likewise bore memorial tablets.
However, some one who was Interested In
literary matters and endowed with un
common patience and persistence, even
.tually succeeded in setting the municipal
authorities to remove one of - the In
scriptions, so perhaps in time the place
in which the great â¢ playright really was
born will be authoritatively identified.
It is hoped in this country that a
Wordsworth enthusiast may become the
purchaser .of the Gowbarrow estate.
which Is for sale. It lies' on. the north
side of Ullswater an*l is associated"^sy
all lovers of. the poet with "Aria's Force"
and "Lyulph's Force." It inspired Words
worth to write the poem called "Alrey
Force Valley," where he describes "the
soft eye-music of slow waving boughs'*
caused by the breeze entering the glen.
"The Daffodils" was also written at Gow
barrow. .The Force Is a prominent fea
ture In "The Somnambulist," where
Wordsworth put into words the story of
a girl who walked in her sleep, fell Into
the stream and was rescued by her lover.
De Quincey called Gowbarrow the most
romantic of parks and says that he saw
there "alternately for four miles the most
grotesque and the most awful spectacles."
Apropos of. the recent purchase of the
house in Rome where Joseph Severn
nursed the dying Keats, it has Just been
suggested here that Americans might well
recognize In some way the residence of
Nathaniel Hawthorne in Rome, and per
haps that of W. W. Storey. Hawthorne's
visit gave the world "The Marble Faun"
and "Italian Notebooks"; while the sculp
tor wrote "Robadl Roma" and "Castle St.
Angelo" from the fullness of knowledge.
The Pindan Gardens are already dotted
with busts of celebrated Romans of mod
ern arid classic times, while the Borghese
Gardens contain memorials of Goethe and
Victor Hugo. * '.

SUPPLY OF FRESH AIR
GREAT BOON TO FOREMEN
I ILLUSTRATION OF A DEVICE FOR FACILITATING THE : WORK DP FIREMEN
BY ASSURING A SUPPLY OF FRESH A^R W THE MIDST. OF. 6MOKE AND
POISONOUB FUMES. ~T".- . ,
LJfe caving and flre fighting prom
ise to be revolutionized by the intro
duction of a respiratory apparatus in
vented by Charles E. Cbapin, a mechan*
ical draughtsman of Berkeley. With
this device, Chapin claims the fireman
will be ablÂ« to enter a. smoke-filled
building: and "breathe with ease and
comfort in blinding smoke and chok
ing: Â£as which before would have
brought suffocation in five minutes.
The eupply of air comes \from cylin
ders strapped on his back.
The idea of the apparatus is simple
and it seems a wonder that it was not
thought of many years ago. Light,
â¢weighing but twenty-three pounds.
It does not impede the fireman. A can
vas oiled-silk-lined hood covers his
head. On his back is strapped the air
cylinder, divided into three chambers. A
rubber tube conducts the fresh air to
the headpiece, the fireman breathes this
with easy regularity and the exhale
passes out through a valve before the
mouth.
Around Hhe head is a strap to pre
vent the Inrush of emoke or fumes.
The cylinders carry air enough to last
the man an hour and allow him to
regulate the pressure at wilL It is
fixed, however, so that no frightened
impulse will allow the fireman to waste
his air in a short time. He can get no
more than will just satisfy his lung
capacity. The contrivance can be
placed on the back in twenty seconds
and there seems to be no possible way
by which It can get out of order and
leave its bearer helpless. The email
chamber In the middle is a sort of
safety device, allowing the fireman to
call on this supply only after the other
chambers are exhausted.
Tests have been made in this city by
V. K. Stein, who has shown the appa
ratus to Chief Sullivan of this city. In

SCORES A HIT
Careful Production Enhances
the Return of Two Favor
ites to the Central Theater
PLAYHOUSE IS CROWDED
First-Nighfefs^ Turii Out to
Warmly 4 (rreet; Herscliel
3lhyaU and Agnes vÃaiilvenT
Last- night was an auspicious one in ; the
bistory of the ' Central Theater,': for .ft
niarked the return to the ''playhouse of
two former favorites/, whose absence has
been mTssed many a time during: the ?last
few months. Herschcl Mayall, after a
long engagement with Miss' Florence Rob
erts at' the California, and Miss Agnes
Ranken, who has been absent for a long
time, returned to claim the greetings of
a crowded 'house. It is seldom that Mon
day night : attract* such an audience afi
was in the Central last night, butithe re
turn of the favorites and the strength" of
the bill, "Blue Jeans," could hardly, fail
to lill the house. . . . v â¢''
To say that Mayall had the audience
with him throughout the evening If hardly
the truth, for there are many phases of
the thankless part of Perry iÃascom. that
do "not appeal to the sympathies of the
audience. But at no time was 'Mayall out
of the scene, and his .work showed that
his engagement with . Miss.- Roberta has
not hurt him. . Many, of the mannerisms
that he acquired during his. last season
at the Central ware pleasantly absent lael
night. Given better parts. Mayall - will
not fail to capture the hearts of the Cen
tral's parons.
Too much praise can scarcely, be ac
corded the- work of Agnes Ranken aa
June. While the part contains' no great
emotional scenes there are : many dra
matic feiuches given by the clever, actress
that approach perfection, Throughdut tho
long, hard part' she waÂ» entirely. in the
character and at all times gracious ; and
pleasing. '\u25a0/-'
Shurner has little to do aa the misguided
lover of the arch-villainess Sue, played
by Miss Edna Ellsmere quite convincing
ly, but meets, ev^y requirement. Corrt
gan's appearance is sure to evoke enthusi
asm at the Central, and his work, though
rather blatant, pleased the house. Nich
olls gave a colorless portrayal of a color
less part as the Colonel. Â»The -smaller
parts were all. capably handled and an
even, clean cut. performance was the re
sult.
Regarding the .play ; itself, . the work . of
an exceptional stage . director, Matt' B.
Snyder. = is' qulte'-apparent' and/, has re
juvenated <tiie " old * playV .; Prom' start to
finish there was scarcely a hitch and the
scenery, ! lights and ; characters | shpwed
careful -supervision. . AVlth \the present
Btrong v company and 'capable stage di

assured at coming treats. . ; ' V ;

Kendall in. ''Weather Beaten" Benson.
This laughter-provoking star has many
friends here who were won by his infec
tious comedy in . his fqrmer success,
"The Vinegar Buyer." "Weather Beaten
Benson" is said to' be even a better
vehicle for the display of Kendall s
talents, and he will.be supported in his
amusing efforts by a strong company,
including Thurlow Bergen, Harold Rus
sell, John D. CJarrick,. Philip Bishop,
Kathryne Browne, 'Ethel Brandon,
Edith ; Taliaferro, Polly ; Stockwell,
Elizabeth : King and- Red- O'Neil; sq The
original Scenes â¢ 'and r effects â¢ will i be
brought' here unchanged, including the
great rainstorm, which is described as
the most realistic downpour ever Been
on the Htage. A big house will be on
hand at the opening of the Columbia
season' and will be composed of many

The Chute*.
"Princess'Fah Tan," now in the third
and last week of a most successful run
at the Chutes, pleased two j large audi
ences yesterday. This delightful Japa
nese musical extravaganza, although
participated In entirely by children,
proves highly, diverting to adults, and
the fact that all of the talented young
sters, in.'the ; cast -are San Franciscans

SAN BERNARDINO, July 2*.-Rose
Garcia, _a* pretty Mexican girl wbose
father runs a barber shop cere, had , a
desperate fight last night with Felix Fer
nandez, one of her father's barbers who
was robbing . their home. \u25a0 Fernandez
boards at the Garcia home, and last
night about midnight crawled Into his em
ployer's room, where he secured the
watches of Mr. and Mrs. Garcia, then
went for an old trunk, where he knew
that Garcia had stored $165 of his savings.
He' was in ,the act of arising from .his.
knees in front of the trunk when the girl
crept in and" threw her arms around his
neck from behind. He fought fiercely and
tried to use a huge butcher knife, but she
held 'on all the tighter until her father
and mother .answered, ber cries- Â« .. Â».
I ..As they', entered xhe door: Fernandez{
sucoeededriri throwing. tnVgifl off *a'n~d
made a bolt for another door. The, wire,,
Screening threw., him back. rushed
against the" old jioupleancU '~ knocking
them UJbwn," gained ,the street.-' *\ ; ,- , 1
. This 'morning, believing that he had
not been recognized, he showed up*, for
work, smiling cheerfully,' An .-officer
soon had him uniler arrest. He had
hidden the money and .watches, but the
police believe- they will soon make him
reveal his cache. The girl is only a
slight little thing and her bravery Is
the talk of the town. â¢- Â» â¢
"Yah" and Â«Yip. M
The simple English affirmative Is be
coming somewhat battered .In common
speech, "Yes" hag long sounded as "yus"
from \u25a0 the IJps of the uneducated. But
there Is a present tendency among the
educated to adopt the American variants
upon the word. America has found that
an open vowel or a labial is easier to
pronounce than a. sibilant. And. it has
two . substitutes for "yes." One of them
is "yep" and the other is "yah." '"-'''
Obviously the **yah" comes through the
influence of the simple German "ja,"
which is quite an elemental sound. "Yep,"
on the other band, is clearly a protest
against the waste of time In getting
tcngue; palate "and teeth In" position to
hiss. Phonetic laziness Is what the late
Prof. Max Muller would call it. And
within the last' week the present -writer
has conversed with half-- a dozen men of
culture and position, three r of ' whom
"yah'd," while the other three "yepped."
We -have all heard sermons to the young
on the importance -of learning to - say
"no"â which Is easyâ but s will the pulpit
thunder warnings to those who* will'" Dot
say "yes?"â London Chronicle.
Risk's In Australia.*
An explorer In the > backwoods of Aus
tralia tells how some timber cutters took
big 1 -risks. "I had given instructions to
the men ln'the bnsh that on no account
were they to lay aside the firearms," he
says; v VAfter having been absent" for
a .- short ;time I . returned and â¢ found . that
they, had slung their revolvers and car
bines on a small tree and were working
at about fifty â¢ yards from them.- : â¢I - can
tell you , they - heard ;of It. The natives
have a - playful - habit of dragging their
spears through the grass with their toes
and all the while looking as Innocent as
It is possible for" them to look. If the
natives had only thought of U they might
have -given ; the cutters 'a warm .time."-*.

THE FABLED EGG OF GOLD,
The man of the nursery-tile â¢
' who "killed the goose that laid
the golden egg" founded a '
SCHOOL OF 'â¢ FINANCE and an
ECONOMIC SYSTEM which hav.e\
-.' y not-yet .become extinct; He has an oc-
v'Casidnal * follower among the merchants of
to-day.; .These disciples of the "Golden Egg
School of Finance"- are the merchants who
discover that they are paying too much money
for newspaper ; advertising. } While the past year
khas been a prosperous one, and they have made more
money than ever before, the totals -oL their advertising .
bills for the year frighten them, and tjiey ask: ."Wouldn't
it be fine to have all of this mone^in bank?" And,
like the founder of that philosophy,* who wanted all
of the golden eggs at" once, they figure that they
might- just " as well put -the money in \u25a0 bank .. as to pay
it to newspapers. And- if the man" who killed the goose
in order to secure the golden egg was wise, then the
merchant who tries to SAVE THE MONEY WHICH-
ADVERTISING COST HIM IS WISE, tooâ for the

Pacific Railway and a communication
was read from E. Black Ryan, the tax
agent for the company, asking that a

tant valuation of the company's prop
erties. He did not specify what these

complaint.
"While there has been no complaint
made by the Oakland Traction Consoli
dated, which, with the Key Route Sys
tem, was raised some 52,225.000 on its
properties, the company had a man early

the valuation placed on Its properties,

from before the board ends its session.

absent to-day and Supervisors Kelly,
Rowe and Talcott orcanized for work by
electlng Kelly temporary chairman. They
passed a resolution ordering the notice

Five Seminaries to
Combine in One
Various Creeds Are
Represented by
Instructors.
j BERKELEY, July 24.â The novel
spectacle of representatives of five
theological seminaries, each seminary
; the protege of a Christian denomin
! ation, in attendance at a theological
school session, was to be observed to
day, when the Federated Theological
Summer School began its sessions, in
the First Christian Church of Berkeley.
The summer school is being held under
the auspices of the Pacific Theological
Seminary. The five seminaries which
have united with the Pacific school to
make possible the summer session are
the San Francisco Theological Semin
ary (Presbyterian), San Anselmo:
Church Divinity School of the Pacific
(Episcopal), San Mateo; Berkeley Bi
ble Seminary (Disciples), Berkeley; the
i Pacific Coast Baptist Theoogical Sem-
I mary, Berkeley.
Five distinguished scholars have
been engaged to deliver lectures at
this summer school, these including
President Henry Churchill King of
Oberon College; Professor Graham
Taylor of the Chicago Theological Sem
inary, Professor Hall Laurie Calhoun
of Kentucky University, President John
Samuel Melntosh of the San Francisco
Theological Seminary and Professor
Charles S. Nash of the Congregational
Church Seminary in Berkeley.
Professor Nash opened the sessions of
the summer school this afternoon, say-
Ing that the meeting of students of five
different sects in a summer school of
theology is unique, and an experiment
which will be watched with interest by
theologians throughout the country.
Professor Graham Taylor delivered
the first lecture, at 3 o'clock this after
noon. His topic throughout the session
Is to be: 'The application of Christi
anity to the social tendencies of mod
ern iriÃustr y." He is regarded as a
leader in sociological study, having
been founder of the Chicago Commons,
and in the forefront of the fight in
Chicago for better social conditions.
His special theme this afternoon was:
"The Christian view of the individual
and his changed relation to society."
He declared that there are powerful
tendencies at work now changing the
social relation of individual life. Pro
fessor Taylor \ cited the * effect of the
French Revolution upon the status of
the individual, declaring that it had
brought out the man, making him tri
umphant over the manor, or -the
barony, or the feudal estate. The in
dividual has been supreme, though the
tendency now Is toward interdepend
ence, toward a racial congested, cos
mopolitan population. ... Ecclesi
astically is seen the divisional denom
inationalism giving way before the
spread of the federation idea. . .The
curent is all toward solidarity. Chris
tianity Is able to recognize both in
dividualism and. the unity of the race,
the church, and society. - : .- -\u0084-.
To-morrow morning at 10 o'clock
President King of Oberlln will lecture
on "The Misconceptions of the Facts,"
in connection with his general topic of
"The Seeming Unreality of the Spiri
tual Life." President Melntosh will
speak at 2 o'clock to-morrow on
"Athanasius and the Council of Nice."
"A Definite Obiect" will be the title of
Professor Nash's lecture to-morrow
morning' at 11 o'clock.
Professor Taylor is to be given a
reception at the People's Palace Settle
ment House, 900 Lombard street, San
Francisco, on Tuesday evening at 8
o'clock.
The lectures and regular sessions of
the school of theology are to be held
in the Pacific Theological Seminary or
Berkeley Bible Seminary, 2230 Dana
street. The public lectures will be
given in the First Christian Church on
Dana street.

PASTOR CRITICIZES
AVERAGE SERMONS
Says People Need Instruc

Spiritual Truths.
"The Church as an Educator" was the
subject of a paper by the Rev. Henry K.
Booth, pastor of the First Congregational
Church, Sacramento, read before the
Congregational ministers 1 I meeting yes
terday. Mr. Booth criticized the average
sermon as dealing with non-essential
questions and suggested that the pulpit
should be devoted to the discussion of
fundamental spiritual truths. He said in
part: \u25a0 -.>\u25a0' ..
. Never, was there '& time when the people
were more In need of instruction- In the funda

PRINTERS' SUCCESS.
; WILL vBE ASSURED
Typothetae Is Weakened by
Crocker's Action in Re
turn to Eight Hours.
' Union printers are confident of the suc
cess of their fight since' the return of the
H. S. Crocker Company to the eight
hour schedule. Rumors are rife to the ef
fect that several other firms are consid
ering an eight-hour day, but it is not
known yet which print Bhop will be the
next to accede to the demands of the men.
None of. the houses was able to operate
a full force during the lock-out and the
largest employers did not try to work
their presses at all. .
. The Typographical Union means to win
the fight against the Typothetae by fair
methods, as was instanced by their treat
ment of \u0084.W. R. Boyd, a printer who was
ib'ronght-'frohv St. Louis- in the party of
strike-breakers.-: Boyd was housed with
the rest of the men in the 1 rooms in the
Commercial .Publishing Company's, build
ing, .where he took 'sick 'nearly a week
ago. . He was denied, so he Bays, a glass
of milk arid other food which he thought
necessary to the- sick, but when the
union heard of his plight it furnished
him with a doctor and a room in a lodg
ing house. The man appears very grate
ful for the treatment accorded him. -â¢ ~f- :
Ray H. Perdue of Denver was supplied
with funds to travel- back to his home
because he was dissatisfied with the'con
ditions which he claims were misrepre
sented to him by the. Typothetao. The
Typographical Union paid his expenses
incurred while here, and financed the trip
to Colorado. Francis W. Mclntyre was
sent to Seattle at the expense of the
union yesterday because he was dissatis
fied with the conditions under the \u25a0 nine
hour schedule. .He was working as a
non-union man, but was given money on
applying to the Typographical Union. â¢
There may be some disagreement
among the painters In the early part of
next month over wages and rules. â¢ After
the first ' of August it is \u25a0 contemplated to
have the present wages of journeymen
raised from $3 50 to $4. It i 3 said that
the master painters - are not opposed \u25a0 to
this, provided the Journeymen sever their
present connections and join the masters'
alliance. The question will be thorough
ly discussed before any action Is taken.
-At the coming, convention of the Inter
national Stereotypers' and Electrotypers'
Union of the United States, which will
assemble in Chicago on August 14,
every ; means possible will be resort
ed to by the delegation from this city to
have the convention of 1906 held in San
Francisco. All the influence that Delegate
William B. Kraner of this city, who goes
as the - accredited representative . of the
union, can bring to bear on his brethren
to secure^ the convention here will be
used. In addition to his being the rep
resentative of the union he also speaks
for the California Promotion j Committee.
Accompanying Delegate Kraner are Rep
resentatives J. J. Smith, H. D. Pohlmann

FOUR VICTIMS
OF TOADSTOOLS
Members of ii Philadelphia
Family Eat of Poison and

TWO CHI^DEEX SUEYIVE
Vegetable Is Mistaken for
3lushrooms and Served at
Baby's Birthday Dinner
. PHILADELPHIA. July, 24.â Toadstools,
mixed with mushrooms and eaten at a
birthday. party, caused the death of four
of the' six members of the family of Jos
eph Franzor.' a farmer, who resided near
Landlsvllle. it. J.
The dead are: Joseph Franzor, aged 33
years; his wife, aged 30, and two daugh
ters, aged 7 and 2 years.
The remaining members of the family.
two boys, aged 5 and I years, owe their
.lives to the fact that they did not par
take of the poisonous mixture.'
Franzor was a miner, at Leadville. Colo.
Last March he purchased a 50 acre farm
near Landisvtlle. with money provided by
his wife's brother, who Is at Leadville.
Among the things he raised was a small
quantity of mushrooms. A week ago
last Friday, the family had a birthday
party in honor of the two-year-old daugh
ter. Mushrooms served as one of the
dishes and the 7-year-old daughter said
she knew where mushrooms could bÂ«
found in the wood 3 near by. She gather
ed some of the fungi and the mother,
supposing they were mushrooms, added
them to the mushrooms taken from their
own soil. Only the members of the fami
ly were present at the dinner and only
four of the six ate of the mushrooms.
During the night the father, mother and
two little girls became 111. The next
morning a doctor was sent for and he
diagnosed the cases as hiccough. All four
continued to grow worse, and on Monday
the two children died. A few days later,
the parents were brought to the Medlco-
Chirurgical Hospital in this city, where It
was discovered that they were sufferirig
from toadstool poisoning. The greatest*
interest was taken In the case by the
hospital physicians, but despite their ef
forts, the husband died last night and the
wife to-day. Mrs. Franzor was uncon
scious almost continuously from the time
she became 111. - . .

BOOKIES FADE
AWAY AS THE
COPS APPEAR
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS. July 24.â Fifty uniformed
policemen,' 1 in charge of ; Captain Mo-
Namee, appeared at the Delmar race
track this afternoon after < the second
race to see that no betting /took place.
The; only result of the visit was ;to
force .'the ; scene :of operations of: the
handbookles from the' betting ring to
the 'grand stand, where they piled a
thriving business. In the meanwhile
the bluecoats were In possession of the
ring ion dress parade, making no effort
to follow the bookies in their, opera
tions about the grounds.
' The policevwere denied admission to
the .grounds, but broke through the
ring of gatekeepers after the latter had
made a nominal opposition for the sake
of eecuring grounds for- prosecution.
Ex-Sheriff Henckey of the county, act
ing, as gatekeeper, was knocked down
in the melee. The act of forcing ad
mission to the grounds is an act of
trespass, say the county officials. War
rants were sworn out by a Justice of
the Peace of the county, naming Cap
tain McNamee of the police squad and
several of his sergeants. .
; When Constable Lenz^ of. St." Louis
County attempted to serve the warrants
on Captain McNamee, unassisted, that
officer raised his club and ordered the
county / official back. "This failing
in effect he drew his revolver, but this
still did not Intimidate the county offi
cial, who continued to read the terms
of the warrant.
At this Juncture a plain clothes man

Hook Up To-Morrow Night
TEXAN OUTWEIGHS JEFF
If Olympic Club Man Stows
Giant Away He Will Be
Looked Upon as a .Comer
The fight fans of this city will hava a
chance to see a new heavyweight In ac
tion to-morow night when: Charles Hil
lard, the Texas giant, meets Al Kauf
mann, the pride of the Olympic Club, In
a four-round amateur contest at Wood
ward's Pavilion, under the auspices of
the Hawthorne Club. If size and weight
count for anything the bout should prove
a wonder, for both men are there In the
matter of Inches and ounces.
Hillard- is hailed as - the champion
heavyweight boxer of Texas. He Is a
larger man than Jim Jeffries, standing
six feet four in his . stocking feet and
weighing 230 pound 3. He is said to be a
clever boxer for a man his size and Is
credited with an awful wallop.
â¢ The Texan has the reputation of being
able to take a beating also. In all the
fights of his ring career he managed to
stow his opponents away in a couple of
rounds and he figures on getting rid of
Kaufmann before the mill goes the limit.
As Hillard has never been seen in action
here the followers of the game will have
to wait till after the go before they pro
nounce Judgment on : him.
! Kaufmann is now the undisputed ama
teur heavyweight champion of the Pacific
Coast. There is no one In sight to meet
him save the Texan and if he gets away
with the latter in good style he will be
hailed as a comer who may figure for
the world's title before long. Kaufmann
Is exceedingly clever for a heavyweight
and he relies on hi 3 skill with the mitts
to stand his husky opponent off.
The Olympic Club will turn out in full
force to see their pride take a* chance
against Hillard. The former will be
handled by De Witt Van Court and other
well known exponents of the game from
the home of the winged "O." The Haw
thorne people, headed by Al Young, will
look out for the Texan.
Besides the heavyweight go the Haw
thorne Club has fixed .up an unusually
good card. It Includes bouts between
Johnny Rochs iof the Olympic Club and
Jimmy Carroll of the Occidentals, Jim
Kane and John Brown, John Rodney and
Jack Fawcett, Frank Flores and Pete
Sullivan. Bill Christie and Otto Knock,
and Jack McLaughlin, the amateur
welterweight chamDlon of England, and
Jack HamDton of New Orleans.
All the bouts will be refereed by popu
lar; - Eddia . Smith of Oakland. George
Harting will keep time and Buddy Ryan,
the champion welterweight of the world,
has promised to act as one of the
Judges. â /-\u25a0. â¢'.â¢\u25a0\u25a0: -\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 :

just returned from the desert. He was
on the trail ; of hunters who have been

It. with some brush. Dewey, looking for
something that would give a clew to
the identity of the campers, " raised the

that It was a piece of gold bearing quartz,
worth many dollars. He succeeded In find

He carefully noted the place and started
for Needles. He waa caught In the quick
sands while crossing, the Colorado River
and nearly perished, losing his horse and
supplies. ; He "almost starved walking to
Needles. Finally he came across an In

SMATHERS WILL
QUIT THE TURF
Noted Racing Man Decides to
Sell All His Thoroughbred
Horses Now at Sheepshead
HAS RUN OF BAD LUCK
Poor Biding of His Jockeys
Has Caused Him .to Lose a
Fortune in Betting Eing
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
NEW YORK, July 24.â The announce
ment was made to-day that, dissatisfied
with the outcome of his racing venture
for the year, E. E. Smathers has ordered
that. on Saturday every thoroughbred ha
owns shall be sold without reservation.
The Faslg & Tipton Company will sell la
Sheepshead between sixty and seventy *
running horses owned by Smathers.
Why a man who went Into racing on
a morÂ» ambitious scale than any other
since the late William C. Whitney should
give up his project is only a matter of
conjecture. Mr. Smathers cannot be seen
and his friends were divided In their
opinion, but all of them were agreed that
If ever a man had straight misfortune In
racing Smathers Is that man. He has
been "nosed out" of big purses and larga
wagers. It .was asserted, cftener than any
other man on the turf.
J Misfortune by Jockeys In riding has
snatched from him large sums when hÂ«
could have been reasonably sure of a win
ner as any man can be sure on the turf.
Some of his friends say his racing has
cost him thi3 season alone in the neigh
borhood of Â£50.000. exclusive of stable ex
penses, and, while that sum in no way
impairs his great fortune, it has deter
mined him to quit for a while. In two
seasons it is said he has lost $430,000.
Mr." Smathers turned from harness rac
ing two years ago. He was not very suc
cessful with his new venture. Trainer
Sam Hlldreth was in charge of hia thor
oughbreds. Right after the running of
the Brighton handicap in 1903 McCbesney
was brought East to compete against Wa-
Wr Boy in a special race. At that time
they were the champions of the West and
Eastj. While being prepared for the raco
McChesney stepped on a stone, went lama
and since then he has been practically
useless for racing purposes.
Early last fall Smathers bought a num
ber of yearlings and soon had fifty horses.
Many of his horses, heavily backed, were
beaten. Hlldreth will buy some, of the
horses and race them in his own name.

ITCHES AND BURNS
The return of warm weather means a
return of torture to Eczema sufferers.
The blood is charged with burning adds
and acrid matter which is forced to tha
surface through the pores and glands,
forming pustules which discharge a sticky
fluid; and the itchiitg is intense.
. The doctors said I had pustular Ec-
zema; it-would break out in. small whits
pustules, mostly on my face and hands,
discharging- a sticky fluid; crusts -would
form and drop off, leaving the skin red
and inflamed. I was tormented with
the ' itching; and â¢ burning character-
istic of the disease for five years, and
during the time used various medicated
soaps, ointments and washes, but thesa
applications seemed to make me worse.
After taking: S. S. S. a short time I be-
Â«ran to improve; the itching did not
-worry me ao much. I continued : the
medicine, and soon all the ugrly erup-
tions disappeared and my skin is now as

PUBLIC OWNERSHIP.
â¢\u25a0nVERY one appreciates the evils of natural monopoly,, left
-< unregulated. To this appreciation we owe the still growing
*r? system of law devised for the control of corporations and
the regulation of the large business operations, which are imper
fectly curbed, if at all, by competition. It is the business of Gov
ernment to regulate and control these monopolies, to govern them
in short, just as individuals are governed. But we have an increas
ing number of theorists and politicians who do riot want Govern :
raent projected into that field as a regulator. They want the
Government to be the monopolist, and to occupy the field as owner
and operator of railroads, telegraphs, telephones, steamers and
mines. This means that sovereignty is to become the monopolist.
As sovereignty is independent of control, who and what then will
regulate the monopoly?
Professor James Mayor of Toronto University has considered
this question in an address upon "The Functions of Municipalities,
With Special Reference to Public Services/ in which he says: "The
view has been advanced that municipalities are face to face with a
dilemma: either the public services must be rendered by the mu
nicipality directly, or the people must submit to be mercilessly
fleeced by a rapacious corporation. This view can hardly be seri
" ously maintained, but, if it were, then even a rapacious corporation,
'exposed to the weakness inherent in such corporations, exposed to
the fluctuations of the markets and the progress of invention, and,
above all, exposed to the criticism of the public, as well as of the pub
â¢ lie authority, is on the whole to be preferred in the long run to a
public authority, with all the weight of the law behind it, and all
/the influence of possession of the public purse, and without the
check of any organized criticism."
\ This thoughtful observation may well be remembered by the
people who are being importuned to make of government a business
monopolist. In this country we have of necessity party government.
\ Griticism of the Government is necessarily partisan. The outs find
fault with the ins. Every criticism is ascribed to partisan rancor
and spirit- The partisans of the ins are impervious to the political
arguments of the outs, and they rally to the support of their side.
We see what this means in the Democratic government of New
York and the Republican government of Philadelphia.
When government becomes a monopolist of transportation and
communication, or all of the means of production, transportation
and intercourse, this will be a monopoly of the ins. They will have
the influence of the power of the aggregated monopolies, added to
the influence of party, and to its desire to have the monopolies for
its own. Back of this will be the power of the public purse. Does
any one doubt that under such circumstances the Government mo
nopoly will be harder to bear, more costly and less possible of
change, than a corporate monopoly ? A corporate monopoly has
no ' partisan defense. In the nature of things all parties are its
critics and accusers. For the sake of public favor they pick it to
pieces. They compete with each other in spying into its faults and
in the promise of regulative remedy.
We are perfectly aware that the advocates of Government mo
nopoly charge that regulation is impossible, because of corporate
influence over and corruption of the individuals who compose the
Government in its various branches. Yet these theorists propose
.to put the vast group of monopolies in the hands of the same in
dividuals, or of others like them, to operate, with only one party in
stead of two to watch and criticise them.
The views of Professor Mayor were made public a year before
Mr. Dalrymple came to this country as an expert in the operation
of municipal monopolies. It will be seen that he and the professor
have the same view. Government is a political affair entirely.
Whatever it does is political, in the nature of things. It does, in
this country, whatever is best for the party in power, and that is
usually whatever will^ control the most* votes. It is majority gov
ernment, and the policy that gets the most votes is of course the
majority policy. With this principle at work corporate monopoly
is sure of being controlled, checked and disciplined, because that is
what the majority wants. But make the same majority the owner
of the aggregated monopolies of the country and its conduct will be
very different.
The best evidence that Government has controlled the different
lines of business, which the theorists want it to own and operate, is
the formidable body of corporation law. that has been formed by
the legislative and judicial authority. The. Federal and State stat
utes on the subject make an immense code, and the judicial de-
cisions applying the principles of law to the business of corporations
are of equal volume. But when the Government owns all that it has
regulated, these laws and decisions will not be operative. The Gov
ernment cannot be sued. No judgment against it could go to execu
tion if it were possible to get judgment. It pays or not, as it
pleases, for it is sovereignty.
THEOLOGICAL SUMMER SCHOOL.
LIBERALITY in religion, when it can be attained without the
sacrifice of essential principles, is both one of the pressing
needs and one of the strong tendencies of our times. That
five sectarian seminaries of this State are to unite in providing a
summer school to teach theology in a broad and tolerant way' is a
subject for congratulations all around. The school is to be held at
Berkeley. It is to provide the opportunity to the busy ministers
of the State to spend a part of thair vacation listening to chosen
lecturers. . President King of Oberlin College is to be among the in
structors. Some of the lectures are to be open to the public. One
of these has the title, "The Industrial Crisis and Family Life."
That is a good subject and needs wise, tolerant and at the same
time sternly moral treatment in discussion at this time. >The social
organism wants the strongest and best thoughts advanced in order
that a' selection may' be made of those most needed at this stage
of our development. In putting forth thoughts on this subject of
great present concern it is well to^make them as tolerant and broad
based as they can be while still consistent with true. morality. It is
desirable to hear the churches speak upon them with some of the
authority of collective wisdomâ so that the attention of the listen
ing world may have no taint of believing that it hears the opinions
of a house divided against itself. It is very desirable,, too, that
some of the ideals of betterment and some of the safeguards of
conservatism adopted in social evolution should come from the
church. If it fails to furnish assimilable ones the big, evolving
social organism will move right on with the' urge of some other
stimulus â making a rough and ready morality of its own, for a
morality of some sort we must have. It will be much; better to have
this morality come from the church; for then it will have more? of
the beauty of devotion, more of the glow of worship, more of the
sanction of divine appointment.
There is one particular reason why the -views "of churchmen 'on
subjects that are on the blackboard waiting solution should be heard
with hopefulness, and. that is their insistence on personal righteous
ness. No part of political or social system that we can improve V or
initiate -brand new will work satisfactorily without the individual's
integrity. Socialism, capitalism, individualism, trade-unionism, easy
divorce or indissoluble marriage; are all matters : of indifference com
pared with the personal factor. -We know, ; of course, -perfection of :the
individual is as impossible as that of any system; but it is to be
noted that the churchmen stick to the j teaching of iKat one most
essential thing century after century, while the secular world ex
periments with . ever changing system s. It is weli ; to have our protK
Jems of industrialism and family life discussed from the point lof
view- of those who are experts in that principle that holds unchahg
ing amidst the rise and fall of systems. ' * ..

Industrious Litterateur With
a Broken Back.
PARAX.YZED SONG AND STORY
WRITER, FORMERLY AN ACTOR,
AND HIS SECRETARY.
OVER in Pacific street, Brooklyn,
just beyond Tompkins aye r
nue, where the houses have sweet
little gardens, the afternoon sun
falls on a remarkable; invalid,, who has
lain helpless with paralyzed spine and
legs for eight years, says the Now York
Herald.
A pale-faced young man who suffers
with a broken back sustained in child
hood is his attendant and secretary.
These two helpless ones â twins in suf
fering â found each other years ago in,
a charity hospital for incurables and
became friends and sufferers together.
The invalid is Charles Noel Douglas,
formerly an actor; but now a successful,
evea : * famous, song and: story writer.
The young man with the broken; back
is Clarence Helmer. Though a cripple
for- life' his head is clear, n andc with a
good set of legs and arms he looks after
the affairs of the paralyzed poet, and
between them they manage to keep out
of the poorhouse and give the world
songs full of joy and sunshine. â¢
In ISSB, at the age of 24, Mr. Douglas,
a young collegian, came to this country
from England and went on the road
with a small theatrical company, which
was stranded 350 miles from New York.
His baggage was .attached for the ho
tel bill and he considered himself for
tunate In. finding 28 cents in his pocket
on his return to New York. He still
had hopes.
' In a few months he succeeded in ob
taining a new position as leading man
âthe villainâ ln another company.
With him were Sam Bernard. Harry '
Gilfoil and the late Jerome Sykes. In
making the required stage fall every
night Mr. Douglas discovered; that he
was disabling his spine, and later he
had a serious contusion. > While in great
favor at Helena, Mont., he accepted a
position in the Surveyor General's office
for three years. He was to make maps,
and being a natural draughtsman turn
ed out work that was complimented by
the Government authorities at Wash-.
Ington. The stenographer "of his office
was Miss Kate Roberts, who afterward
became the wife of Senator Clark;/
STRICKEN* WITH PARALYSIS.
Mr. Douglas imagined that he was re
covering from his spinal troubles, and,
returning East, began / acting" again,
when suddenly- he was; stricken ' with
paralysis and sent to; a public hospital:
First It was a private /room, then . the
ward, and, finally,' â¢ a; : free â¢ bed. - His
money running out, he saw tha*. he
would soon have to go to the poorhouse
or into the street. His collapse began
with a sinking spell,- and he : thought
the end had come. I^ls body began to
vibrate and he felt as if an immense
dynamo were attached to his feet. >He
says: "The current crept up my Clegs
and arms and body, which became rigid'
and lifeless. I had no sensibility, ln my
hands or limbs. The.:, attendant /was
alarmed, and administered; stimulants
and tried , to , restore circulation by; fric
tion and manipulation. - When at last
the vibrating current: reached; my. head
I said Kood-by '.'. to ; those ; about me" ; My
jaw went click! and dropped, and to all
appearances I was dead.Jfaffiaffiftj
"Yet almost Instantly, consciousness
returned and circulation seemed (to = ref
sume as by magic. / I could see and hear
myself speak, and I realized that I was
alive again. . â¢_ ,
"The hospital experts believed little
in my complaints, the doctors laughed
at'me and famous; neurologists inform
ed me that - the symptoms I * had ; de
scribed- were impossible. lin my
desperation I said: .'I -wish' to i God: you
had them !' 'For my ;.' audacity - 1 ;, was
dumped into -an icy bath and ylater my
back was cauterized, 'that I; might -not

COMPOSES SONGS.
"One day in my desperation I resolved
to try /my hand at writing a song: and
raise means enough to get into a home
for incurables. .Only money could save
me now. With a bit of pencil and a few
scraps of paper, with neither pen, ink,
envelopes nor stamps I set to , work to
compose the words, of a song. During
my stage career : l had written my own
encores in verse, and I felt that I might
compose something again. "
"The: result was a. little coon song
lyric, a little lullaby tinged with senti
ment and sadness, an echo of my own
condition. A fellow patient; copied the
song and sent It to May Irwin.
"How, I prayed and hoped while I
waited! My life depended on that song.
It seemed as if I were in a dream,
when, forty-eight hours later, her
check came to me and with it a letter
saying, 'I will call when, my season
closes.' / â¢
"Immediately I began another lyric,
entitled 'Little Kinky Woolly Head,' and
sent it to Weber &' Fields'. After, three
days/of susnense, when' I thought I
could - hear 1 the ambulance coming to
carry me away to â¢ the poorhouse, a
stranger entered the ward, threaded his
way among the twenty-four beds,/ and
was led by the nurse into my presence.
He was from Weber & Fields' and had
come to ask me to sign a bill; of sale
for the song. When I had written my
name to the document he handed me a
twenty dollar bill. Pages could not
describe' my Joy and hopes. _ Now sure
I could/write: a little, enough I hoped
to keep out'of the poorhouse.
: "My- first' earnings enabled nic to go
to another hospital, where I spent
eighteen months, and later to gain ad
mittance to a hospital I for' \u25a0 incurables,'
where I spent three and a half years.
It-Jwas here .that I began .to win fame,
many friends and some money. ;
MEETS THE ' HUNCHBACK.
/"'â¢'lt.was here that I did iny.best'ybrk,
and here I met Clarence 1 Helmer.y the
little hunchback, whoso life has become
linked with mine. -His misfortune came
from an accident. He lived- on a ". farm
with his parents in the northern part of
the State. At the age of .6 he broke
his back, falling downs tairs: It killed
his mother, who was very ; ill. ' His
father died a few days after, and the
poor boy was taken to the poorhouse at
Rome. I can only- hint of his suffering
for many long years.
"He was approaching his majorlty
when I entered the 1 hospital and be
came his friend. Imagine what hard
ships he had endured! The boy had to
fight with the rats for /every mouthful
that he ate. At, 9 he was sent to? the
orphanage at Utica; where he/remained
until 18; thence he' was v sent v to' the
honie for incurables in which I was try-
Ing to exist. He; and; I /were: in the
same ward, and at once became friends
for life. /
/'At Ahls time I subsisted;; largely by
makingpen copies of famous drawings,
and . Clarence cleaned my; pictures, for
I was 'too weak to do ; it ; myself. /He
managed^them for me,' and .did other lit
tle services, for which. I paid him,. and
he hid the money ; ln/ a little ; bag fas
tened ; around ; his "neck. - It was;: this
money, though it amounted i to; little,'
that inspired .him to "â¢ make his * escape
when he should reach, 21 T and: become
his own master. You see, they: wanted
to/keep , ; the; boy after/: his /majority, to
be a drudge in the; hospital,/ and as the
State was ; paying the institution $200
or â¢ $300 \u25a0 a year , for v his ' care, the concern
would j be 'that much In. \u25a0 ,
"This is how he &ot away. ".. He made
a dummy, put it In : bed; and covered; it
with sheet and quilt, which the; night
nurse did . not observe in her rounds.
Theboy slipped out and? vanished,, and
with 'the money (that ?he had ; ; saved ; he
was r able ,' toS get] far I enough; away,: for
safety.
\u0084"Meanwhlle my v own condition -was
improving, and a song^that I wrote and
Bent to' Francis Wilson brought a sub

What the Women Do Better
Than the Men.
â¢Â» tf ANY a man maintains that there
|\/1 Is nothing which. If a /man
XYA gives his mind to it, he cannot
V do better than a woman; that
while she has succeeded in a mediocre
manner and with much effort in many
of man's special. provinces, he has sel
dom cared to invade her domains, and
where he has done so he has met with
signal success.
This dictum. naturally rouses the av
erage woman to a wnite heat of Indig
nation, but It is one which she finds
somewhat difficult to disprove. Here
are a' few subjects' in which man ex
cels:
Dressmaking â It is an acknowledged
fact that tailors cut and fit with greater
accuracy than dressmakers; and the
greatest artists in designing costumes
tq be worn by the fair are. all,
men: .What dressmaker' ranks with
Worth. Paquin "or Redfern?-
\u25a0 Cookingâ Whereis the cook who has
reached the historical renown 5 of the
many celebrated' chefsâ Vatel; Ba var in;
Soyer, Escoffler and many others?
Needleworkâ lt is t?ue that in Britain,
woman holds the palm for that; but.to
prove that man can do it \u25a0 when he
chooses, -one has only to point to the
East, S here all the gorgeous embroid
eries are the work of men. ; \u25a0;: .'\~-*>~ i
Teaching the Youngâ The great kin
dergarten' system, which has revolu
tionized the whole of modern teaching,
was the discovery of a man.
Is it, then, true that where woman
excels she does it only by the forbear
ance of man, when he refrains from
competing?
Not altogether, for the greatest of
all functions is still hers, and hers
alone. In the nursery, she stiir reigns
supreme, and,- unless Â»he should volun
tarily dethrone ; herself, there she . will
remain so long as the world lasts.
No man has ever proved a successful
substitute for a motherâ not even in
tnese days of artificial foods and elab
orate-theoretic training of children. .;\u25a0 ,
*Hs is, Indeed, an open question
whether a woman alone would not be
more successful in the bringlng-np and
launching- into the world of a family

It is true that of famous women per
formers on musical . instruments there
are very few. but at the same time a
woman - singer produces more effect
than a man, and there have been on the
whole more who could be really called
great.
On the stage also woman must be ac

Austen- dared only write by stealth for

out of ten successful novels in a year,
a good proportion will be by, women.
In nursing- the sick the average wom
an is certainly better than the average
man, though certain exceptional men
do make most excellent nurses.
On .a humbler plane we find women
excelling in such dainty work as lace

that men whocan do such delicate
work as fine wood carving, or adjust

Millinery seems to be a branch of

A Lunch Fit for a Klnar.
An active and successful .yoong lady
tells her food experience:. :.. . ,_j. j
"Some three years ago! suffered' from
nervous prostration, induced bj; contin-
uous brain strain and improper food,
adatd to a great grief.
"I was ordered to give up my work,
ss there was great danger of my, mind
failing me altogether. My stomach was
in bad condition (nervous dyspepsia,.!
think now) and .when Grape-Nuts food
was recommended to me, I had no faith
in it. However, I tried it. and soon
found a marked improvement in my
condition as the result. I had been.trou
bled with deathly faint spells, and had
b*en compelled to use a stimulant to re %
vive me, I found. ' however, that s by
eating Grape-Nuts at such times I was
relieved as satisfactorily as by the "Use
of stimulants, and suffered no bad ef-
fects,. which was a great gain. As to my
other troubles â nervous - prostration,
dyspepsia, etc. â the Grape-Nuts diet
soon cured them.
"I wish especially to call the atten-
tion of office girls to the great benefit I
derived from the use of Grape-Nuts as a
noon luncheon. I was thoroughly tired
of cheap restaurants -and ordinary
lunches, and pomade thÂ« experimeni'of
taking a package of Grape-Nuts ..food
with me. and then slipping out at noon
and getting a nickel's worth of sweet
cream to add to it. I found that this
simple dish, finished off with an apple,
peach, orange or a bunch : of - grapes
made a lunch fit for a king, and one
that agreed with me perfectly.

that I did not have to give up my work
at all. and ir. the two years have had
only four lost days charged up against;

PRIMARY ELECTION
TICKETS ARE READY
Men of the Best
Type Named by
:4c JuGciffllG/
REPUBLICANS
ARE CONFIDENT
Kuet s Grangsters
Resorting to
Fraud.
Rooms of the San Francisco ' Repu
blican League, 636 Market street, were
thronged last night with earnest work
ers who have enlisted to "oppose the
reign of graft in the city.
The executive . committee of the
league was In session from 8 o'clock
until midnight and listened to repre
sentatives of every Assembly district
of the town. The reports received were
highly encouraging, leading to the pre
diction that the organization will elect
a majority of the delegates to the Re
publican convention.
It is * especially gratifying to the
founders of the league that the dis
trict clubs in the preparation of their
tickets have proposed for delegates to
the convention an unusually large num
ber of mechanics, artisans and wage
earners. The representation of mer
chants, manufacturers, shipping men,
lawyers, clerks and doctors is fair. Tho
tickets are worthy of support on ac
count of the recognition of the best citi
zenship of San Francisco.
Men of the character proposed by the
league cannot be found in the Ruef fol
lowing. . In many instances the names
of mere nobodies are printed on the
Ruef tickets. For example, in tho
â¢Forty-fourth district the Ruef. or oppo
sition, ticket contains the names of live
obscure Job-holders In the City Hall. It
is noted that the Ruefters in the Forty
fourth have resorted to the deception of
designating their ticket as the "United
Republican League ticket." This device
Is invoked in order to mislead citizens
into the belief that the San Francisco
Republican League is the indorser of
the Ruef bunch. It Is obvious that
similar deception will be attempted in
other districts. .
Ruef gangsters, City Hall grafters and
patrons of opium joints are said to be
largely represented on the precinct elec
tion boards. The Republicans throughout
the city have determined to keep the
closest kind of watch on the counting of
the ballots In the election booths.
Information has been lodged at league
headquarters to the effect that M. Cohn
and J. H. Sinclair, who received the Cof
froth bunch of fraudulent votes at the
last primary election, have been appoint
ed to the election beard of the One Hun
dred and Fourth Precinct, Forty- third
Assembly District.
It is further reported that Ruef s
agents are soliciting, from dry goods
stores, butcher shops and places of busi
ness generally In ths Thirty-fifth District
for small contributions to the opposition
campaign fund. Cash donations of $2 50
are requested and contributions of -(1
readily accepted. â¢ -
Reports come to league headquarters
that the grafters are standing up the sa
loons of the tenderloin for $250 for each
saloon. Outside barrooms are assessed
X2O each.
Many tickets were filed at the Regis
trar's office late last night, and other
filings will be made to-day. The Call
will publish the complete tickets of the
San FranclECO Republican League before
the day of election.
The meeting last night of the reorgan
ized Jeffersonian Democracy, under the
immediate auspices of Police Commis
sioner O'Grady and a Sausalito lawyer,
was a dismal failure. Only thirty surviv
ors of the old party were present.
A BchmlU Club*was organized in the
Thirty-eighth District last night under
the auspices of the Union Labor County
Committee. S. Gunn was elected presi
dent.
SEW CLUB MEETS.
Reorganized Democrats Want No Af-
filiation With Republicans.
The Reorganized Democratic party
held a meeting last night in Its rooms
at 906 Market street. W. G. Burke,
chairman, was muchMn evidence and
was the principal talker. This party
has two watchwords. "Home rule" and
"Anti-boss." These principles were
dominant in the opening speech of the
chairman. The thirty "stolid Reor
ganized Democrats" present all agreed
with the chairman that a ticket should
be put up in each district in opposition
to the McXab. ticket. The McNab
ticket, it was said, was trying to do
"business with the Republican party.
The Reorganized Democrats want none
of this. They want to put up a Demo
cratic ticket and Insist on having a
Democrat nominated for Mayor. They
want to do no business with the Re
publican ticket.
. Chairman Burke In concluding his
speech said: "There never would have
arisen occasion for a labor union party
if the leaders of the present organiza
tion. Irad been .true to the. principles of
Democracy. There. was no plan In the
platform of the labor union party, that
would not have been embraced In the
platform of the Democratic party, had
the leaders of the party stood by the
party principles." ~y - ._-â¢"\u25a0.. '--
FORTY-FIFTH DISTRICT CLUB.
Committee Selected to Choose Eighteen
Delej^Htes to League Convention.
The Forty-fifth District Assembly
Club of the Republican League met last
night in Washington Square Hall and
selected a committee to choose eighteen
delegates to the league convention.
Speeches were made by the leading citi
zens of the district deploring the pres
ent condition of the city administration
and. all were ready to work for the
coming good-government campaign.
Chairman Bundschu called the meet
ing and John Black was appointed as
secretary. The committee selected to
pass on tha delegates .were: Ed Buckley,
Gaetane Malpieno, Eli.T. Shepard, John
Black and Robert Patterson. Each, of
these men was Instructed to do his best
to' secure honest^men . on" the list, and

by Officers O'Brien and Duffy and charg
ed with assault with a deadly weapoir at
the Central police station.'** i- :t --^ /â^''
Ellis claims that he : was 'standing "at
the entrance to the office. when the boys
commenced an argument and later at
tacked him. Humphreys, who came to his
assistance, met a similar fate and it was
not until the police arrived that the riot
was quelled. The boys, when arrestfed,
claimed that Ellis struck the first two
blows and that he later pulled a gun,
after which they fled. Both Welch and
Armanino assert that they approached
the office for the purpose of trying to in
duce newsboys not to distribute the Bul
letin when Ellis Interfered and a wordy
war commenced In which the word
"grafter" was used many times. Blows
resulted and once the fight commenced
the newsboys found plenty of-assistance.
Ellis was treated by a physician. He
denies that he used a weapon. Thomas-

rested for assault made upon George M.

SECRETS OF THE WAR GAME
KEPT FROM THE JAPANESE
Xevf Rnles Made on Advice of "Bob"
Evans, Whose Servant Had Be
come Commander.
Uncle Sam has thrown a cordon of
safety about the Chesapeake war game,
and every effort. had been made to en
shroud the method employed in the Joint
army and navy exercises in secrecy, jj .
The" fact leaked out that the
Navy Department had Issued orders that
none but duly accredited persons be al
lowed on tne vessels of the fleet, the or
ders even including the Japanese ser
vants, which'for years thave been em
ployed in various capacities in the ward
room and S the cooking department of
Uncle Sam's warships. . - -
When the gunboat Hornet, flagship of
the Maryland jj naval - reserves arrived
here there was aboard of her a Japanese
chef who had , been'- In the service for
years and he had gained fame for hfs
delicious dishes. , .... " : ., . I.' " _
Before the Hornet. left with the naval
reserve fleet the Japanese chef took his
departure from the vessel. :
This "action of. the Navy Department is
said to have been based on a story told
by. Rear Admiral "Fighting Bob" Evans
on his recent return from the "command
of the American fleet on the Asiatic sta

The Admiral said his flagship "put Into
Shanghai, where a powerful Japanese
cruiser lay at anchor. There were a
number, of; war. vessels of other nations
there and the usual, salutes were fired
and courtesies, exchanged.
Admiral Evans put off In his launch to
visit the Japanese cruiser. He was [ush
ered Into the commander's "cabin, where
he was 'greeted by a dapper little .Jap
anese officer, who introduced him to the
rest of: the officers;^ ;; ' _V ' ;
Refreshments were brought in and the

Shaw, i c. W\u25a0; ;.-, -\u25a0 : ', -V.-
Mrs. Coffin, looking very fetching and
very feminine, introduced the veteran
worker in the cause, Mrs. Austin Sperry,
requesting that she preside as president
emeritus. Without waste of words, Mrs.
Sperry accepted the honor and straight
way presented the \ well-beloved leader,
Susan B. Anthonyâ she who for fifty-two
years has directed every, volt of -her
energy toward the uplifting, of women
and children. - .-
Erect, lithe and agile she stepped for
wardâthis woman of 85â and were it not
for the whitened locks on her temples,
and. the few lines on her mobile face,
one would guess her not older . than 50.
And as to her voice, -It was clear and
resonant, and the words came quickly as
the battles of the past' came before her
in review. \u25a0 \u25a0"'â¢' \u25a0
With ready tongue, and ready wit, she
told of the early struggles of the sister
hood, of the gibes and the Insults and the
hardships they met .with; of the famous
"fraudulent voting" -*of -'72, when she and
thirteen other women .of | Rochester at
tempted to vote and , were promptly
shoved into the , hurry, wagonâ if they; had
one In Rochester jway,. back ln'\'72â and
hurried off to Jail; of the famous appeal
to President. Ctrant, and .the equally fa
mous and. funny , trial, and their final
pardon. All this she told in vigorous
fashion, declaring that' "From* that day,
the movement, has gone t steadlly ; forward.
And now. that success is at ' hand, you'd
better ,[ get in the' band-wagon and come
in with the procession.'.' : So r much for a
woman ; 85 years youngâ a living rebuke
to women who at 56, "let go" and grow
fat and dull and useless., . . '
Then came the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw
âshe who became famous ten years, ago
by finding in California a flawless man)
and making him famous therebyâ poor
Professor Griggs, who has never been able
since to live down the reputation. '
For directness, clearness, logic, , wit,
humor, pathos, quick- wlttedness and com
pelling magnetism, that talk of hers has
set a new standard for Alhambra elo
quence.
A wonderfully resonant voice is hersâ
with tears in. it at one moment, a volley
of laughter at another; tender when she
told of the reasons why women should
voteâ that they .'might "help in the : work
of saving children, the. victims of,heredi
ty and environment." â¢ \u25a0
: In her talk she declared that in the
United States there are 10,000 children
, 12 behind , bars for crime, and that
annually' the records grow heavier. "^
"Here," says the lady eloquent, "here
Is where women are needed, for women
can reach boys', hearts "when all 'else
falls. You men have made miserable
failures of your Jails and reformatories
in that they jdo not reform,": but \ confirm
the criminal; in his ;. immoralities. .Then
why are you not wise enoughâ not gener
ous enough to untie the hands .of - the
mothers of - the race and let ! them help
you right the wrong?- The feminine in
stinct, the mother : Instinct will do It if
you will but give him ' the chance." . ;
A new note was struck when Miss Shaw
declared that the ; relations of men and
women should be .', dual in political life
as well as domestic and .social â each as
complement to the other; that j the herd
ing of , women .was . as detrimen
tal to efficiency as .the herding of
men together; that; the natural ref
lation was the ~ only = true "I relation,
each bearing a share; 1 and . that
the best forms of government will come
only when men and women- together per
form the- duties of citizenshipâ the men
looking specially after ;the industrial in
terests, and the women the moral and the
social. â¢ â¢. \u0084 ,\u25a0 -,'\u25a0\u25a0

CABLE HOLDS WHALE
FAST UNTIL DEATH
Marine Monster Becomes Entangled In
Alaskan Cable and Stops Its
Working.
The submarine cable between Valdez,
on Prince" William Sound, Alaska, and
Sltka, Alaska, was suddenly Interrupted
after It had been In successful operation
for a month and the cable ship pro
ceeding to the point of trouble found the
cable had become fastened securely, the
officers thought, under a rock. The ship
was accordingly maneuvered to loosen
it. : -" ; ." ' \u25a0 ' .-.;'-\u25a0\u25a0 â¢' -
Heaving In was slowly continued when
the carcass of a whale appeared with a
loop of the cable fastened around the
lower -Jaw. The loop was twisted as
well,- thus .securely s holding the whale.
The "carcass was badly decayed and the
stench made the task of loosening the
cable from the jaw. most trying. During
its-struggle the huge j anmall had badly
twisted and torn the, cable in its vicinity,
making "several breaks in the conductor,
thus S interrupting communication.
The steel^armorwires, with the excep
tion of three; -were broken at the twist
of the loop and had the cable not possess
ed great tensile strength ' (2000 pounds) it
would undoubtedly, have been broken.
A splice was soon made and communica
tion between Valdez and Si tka restored.
One theory as to this peculiar accident
is that the whala In feeding along the
bottom was swimming slowly, with . jaws
open. > The cable being suspended on Ir
regularities - of the bottom, it came
across the whale's open mouth and; the
animal, In its endeavor to disengage_it
self, threw a loop : In the cable. The
whale- was 50 feet long. The depth at
the .place where It was found is slxty
flve fathoms.
One other case of interruption of a ca
ble by a whale is on record. This occur
red in the Bed Sea many years ago
and was caused by a loop of the cable
being caught around the whale's tail.â

now been followed by a startling marine
phenomenon in > the^ Indian ocean. Cap
tainÃelton of the British steamship City
of Dundee, which arrived recently at
Kurrachee, reported that while he was
almost IDO j mllea off the port E the sur
face of | the ocean ; was illuminated for
some time in all directions by. mysterious
flashes, which proceeded, apparently, out
of the water, and for whicbh he was quite
unable to>account. He was so bewildered
and amartd that ; he '[ stopped his ship
until he could make sure of his position,
not knowing into- what strange regions he
might - have \u25a0 wandered. ' About the same
time the " seacoast around Kurrachee was
covered by vast shoals of dead fish, hun
dred of \u25a0\u25a0 tons, which had to be removed

Political Prisoner Who Later Attained

The Rome corresDondent of The Pall
Mall Gazette relates that about a quarter
of a century ago. when the fierce con
flict between the monarchlal and repub
lican parties as to the best form of gov
ernment, was not yet quelled in Italy, the
republicans appointed a meeting at Villa
Ruffl, intending, if deemed needful, to
resort to arms. The government, how
ever, obtained Information which led to
several arrests. Among those taken
charge of was a young man of agreeable
aspect who had distinguished himself by
his enthusiasm and by his abilities. The
caribineer whose duty it was to put
handcuffs on him said: "I shall fasten
them loosely so as not to hurt you."
"You can trust me," said the prisoner:
"I shall" not run away, for I should be
sorry to do you an Injury."
j "men," said the carabineer, "as long
as you are Intrusted to me you may con
sider me as a friend."
j "I shall remember that." said the pris
oner laughing," "when I am President of
the Italian Republic." *
"Very well, I shall hold you to It."
said the carabineer, continuing the Joke.
"What is your name?"
"Aleseandro Fortls," was the reply.
That young prisoner, Instead of hav4hg
become President of the Italian Repub
lic,, is now president of . the Council of
Ministers of the King of Italy. The cara
bineer, who has risen to the rank of brig
adier, has not forgotten the incident of
the Villa Rufn, and Premier Fortis has
kept his promise.

WASHINGTON. July 24.â Actinjf Sur
geon General Glennon of the Public
Hea|th and Marine Hospital Service, to
day was Informed by Surgeon "White,
who represents that service at New Or
leans, that there had been a death from
yellow fever in that city to-day out6ide
the district in which the previous deaths
had occurred. I>r. White also notined
Dr. Glennon that detention camps would
bÂ« established at Kenner. Avondale,
Waverly and Andslit, all small places on
the railroads near New Orleans. The
camps will be supplied with stores from
the Go\'ernment depository at Fontaine
blsau. Miss.
NEW ORLEANS. July 24.â Mayor Behr
man to-night Issued a proclamation to the
people ' of New OrleanÂ»^urg^ng them to
he*d the advice of the health authorities
relative to the sanitation of their prem
ises and calling special attention to the
necessity of screening: the houses and
placing nets over the cisterns and all
pools of water which might breed mos-
QUltoes. This proclamation was also
signed by the president of the State
Board of Health, president of the Health
Board, Surgeon White, of the Marine
Hospital Service and the advisory com
mittee of the New Orleans Parish Medi
cal Society. *â¢
At a meeting of the State Board of
Health to-floy it was decided, in response
to the numerous requests for information
from the parish health officers, to pre
pare and eend out a detailed statement of
the situation. This will include an offi
cial statement that up to date there have
been seventeen cases of fever here and
six deaths.
The quarantine regulations suggested
by the meeting of citizens requiring six
days* detention for all vessels from ports
liable to yellow fever were adopted after
a very heated discussion. All the pas
sengers of the steamship Excelsior ex
cepting cix lmmunes were quarantined at
the Tres Cornia detention station. They
made no complaint. This is the first case
of a quarantine against passengers from
the United States. ouv
I^arge numbers of people are returning
to New Orleans from the surrounding
ports to avoid being separated from their
families, owing to the rigidity of the
quarantine regulations that have been
put into effect.
United States Army Surgeon Moss of
Ban Antonio arrived to-day with a view
to examining into conditions. He comes
in connection with the recommendations
for the removal of the men now at the
United States barracks to Chattanooga.
There is no sickness reported at the bar
racks, but as many of the soldiers are
unaccllmated it has been considered ad
visable to ask their removal from New
Orleans.
The health authorities continue to in
sist that there is absolutely no cause for
alarm and that if people will follow the
directions that are being published the
fever can be restricted, successfully
treated and stamped out.

Motor Boat Talisman Sails
From New York to Marble-
Jiead, Winniiig Silver Cup
SKnÂ»PER TAKES CHANCE
Smallest Craft in Fleet of
Twelve Makes Fastest
Time in a 288-Mile Race
MARBLEHEAD, Mass.,* July 24.â After a
daring run along 2SS . miles of the New
England coast in unusually, tempestuous
conditions for ' midsummer, j the 28
foot motor launch Talisman, owned by
William Savllle of Boston and built in
that city, to-day won the race from New-
York to this port, conducted under the
auspices of the Knickerbocker Yacht
Cluti. ' . '
Battered by heavy seas for, nearly
twenty-fonr hours, with iier seams
started and her crew pumping vigorously,
the Talisman, the smallest of the fleet
of twelve which started in the contest at
noon on Saturday, struggled Into this
harbor this morning and crossed the fin
ish line at 9:24:66, winning the $250 silver
cup.
Late this afternoon another Boston
boat, the Blink, owned by C. W. Easter
brook, and. the largest boat of the fleet,
came into the harbor, finishing at 6:27:10.
About two hours later the Aquilla,
owned by 8. A. H. Chase of Providence,
R. 1., and the GHsando, owned by S. F.
L. Andrews of Fall River, finished, the
former four seconds In the lead. As both
the. Blink and the, Aqullla allowed the
Gllsando considerable " time, the last
named yacht took the second prize.
At dark to-night the Wood Pile, owned
by A. L. Lincoln of Hlngham, Mass..
passed Highland Light. Cape Cod, while
a sixth boat, the Yeddo, owned by S. M.
Smith of New York, was at Cottage CiÂ»y
and her owner announced that he had
withdrawn from the race. The only other
boat of the twelve , starters to be re
ported was the General Bumps, owned by
P. D. Irwln of Philadelphia, which
reached Cottage City at 1 o'clock yester
day and left an hour later. Since then
she has not been sighted, but Is believed
to 'be in some safe harbor.
The victory of the Talisman was un
doubtedly due to the fearlessness of her
skipper, who did not hesitate to send his
boat through terrific seas all the way
from Point Judith to this port. The
other boats ran into harbors while Â« the
ptorm was at Its worst.

supreme: court reverses
nipper mine decision
Judge Clancy Said to Have Refused to
Admit Evidence Which Should
ft Have Rren Allowed. _ .
HELENA, Mont., July 24. â The Su
preme Court to-day reversed the de
cision of Judge Clancy of Butte In the
case of Edward Hickey, L. A. Hickey
and J. M. Stewart against the Anaconda
and Washoe companies, better known
as the Nipper case, in which the lower
court after a memorable trial held that
certain veins of the Amalgamated
Company's Anaconda and Washoe
mines found their apex in the portion
of. the Nipper mine owned by Helnze.
The case is reversed on account of er
rors largely attributed to the failure
of Judge Clancy to admit certain evi
dence brought out on the closer exam
ination of Stewart, one of the plain
tiffs.

BRITISH BARK BATTLE ABBEY DISGHARGING " EUREH^Af LUMBER
Vessel Too Heavily
Loaded for
.or a
Od i cLy.
Balance of Cargo
Goes to AUS-
There was a roar of protest along tbe
water front yesterday when it was
learned that the British bark Battle
Abbey, at Oakland Ixing Wharf, was
discharging lumber from Eureka. An
alien vessel openly engaging in trade
between two California ports was some
thing to Jar to the surface all the right
eous indignation in every steam schoon
er owner in the port. The fat was in the
lire and sizzling. Then it occurred to some
body that there must be some good
reason for such apparent open violation
of the law dearest to the heart of the
American ship-owner. Somebody in
quired aud somebody in authority ex
plained. Protests to Washington re
mained unwritten and the Battle . Ab
bey's intrusion oh a market sacred to
the Stars and Stripes will be over
looked.
The Battle Abbey went from here
some time ago to Eureka and there
loaded redwood for Fremantle. Aus
tralia, She returned to this port to pick
up some other freight. When she got
here the underwriters' surveyors found
that, in his desire to make the voyage
profitable. Captain Davidson had ac
cepted more lumber than the ship could
safely carry. To return the lumber to
Eureka would involve great expense. To
land the lumber here would be a viola
tion of the law which reserves for Am
erican ships the privilege of trading be
tween American ports. An appeal was
made to Washington and Uncle Sam. in
consideration of the fact that the safety
of the ship demanded that she lighten
her load, gave permission for the dis
charge at Oakland of the necessary
amount of lumber. This is the first
time since the law has been in effect
that any exception to it has. been al
lowed.
Safely at "Nome.
The stearoship Rosecrans, with the oil-laden
\u25a0ckooner Monterey in tow, arrived safely at
Nome July 9. The Monterey is only one of
& number of sailing vessel* which have been
converted into oil carriers and they are the
busiest craft on the coast. Sine* the con
version of these big windjammers into oil
barges long distance ocean towing has become
one of the necessities of the trade, and power
ful tugs like the Dauntless have now Tew
idle moments. The Dauntless arrived here
yesterday from Monterey with the converted
Santiago In tow. In the Santiago's tanks
v.-ere 22.000 barrels cf crude oil. The Daunt
less recently returned from Honolulu, whither
Ehe bad towed an oil -laden barge, and be
tween here and Honolulu the harkentine Ful
lerton is being towed all the time. The
steamer Chico. with 150.000 feet of lumber
on and below her decks, arrived yesterday
from Fort Bragg with the barge, formerly the
chip Tidal Wave, in tow. The Tidal Wave
carried COO.OCiO feet of lumber. The old ship
Dashing Wave Is also doing duty now as a
barge and recently, heavily laden with cattle.
â¢Â«"aji towed to Nome by the steamer Ellhu
Thomson. During that voyage the tow line
parted during a heavy gale and only by the
gTeate*t good fortune were the barge and hÂ«
four-locted passengers caved. Captain Ames
of the EHhu Thomson, which has returned to
Seattle, said the weather was the heaviest -h<
fcÂ«d ever experienced and the recovery of the
tow a miracle.
Is Tnklnjf I"nuÂ«ual Course.
The British bark Dundee, which is now out
I<3 days from Brake for Puget Sound, passed
Anjer July 21. Under ordinary circumstance*
the Dundee should not have been anywhere
near Java, and shipping men are wondering
whether after rounding the Horn she was
blown far out of her course ' or whether ehe
took the passage by -way of the Cape of
Good Hope. They are also wondering which
\u25a0way the will come now. whether through the
Chins, Â£>e& or around the southern coast of
Australia.
Will Not Arrive Until Monday.
Owing to the fact that ehe stayed over at
Tahiti to give her passengers an opportunity
OS seeing the native festivities In connection
\u25a0with the celebration en July 14 of the fall
of the Bastile the liner Marlposa will not
arrive here until July 31. She will sail again
for Tahttl August 6 with another large crowd
ot passengers.
Water Front Xotea.
The Pacific Mall Company's coaster Barra
couta Is due to-day from Panama and way
ports.
The tug Sea. Rover left yesterday for Port
Harford with the barge Sar.ta Paula. In tow.
The liner Siberia is due August 4 from
the Orient.
The liner Coptic is probably the last big
steamship to use the berth at the south Bide
of the Pacific Mall Company's big wharf.
The new wharf is gradually encroaching on
thÂ« old and yesterday the Coptic was moved
to the north side. The next cylinder of the
new wharf dropped Into place will bar the
passage to the berth that for many years has
been occupied by the Occidental and Oriental
lrners. Captain Finch moved the Coptic yes
terday and with the assistance of Captain
George Harvey on the tug Arabs made a
quick job of It.
The Chipperkyle is still on the overdue list,
quoted for reinsurance â¢at 80 per cent. | The
Lafayette and the Red Rock are quoted at 8
per cent.

SEEKS TO AID

State Mineralogist Urges

WOULD ASSIST UN WARY
Act Provides for Guides to
Direct the Thirsty Miner,
Yet Opportunity Is Lost
thirst of parties of prqspec
torsr.and the of men on .the
verge of insanity for the lack of water,
has been the grim record . in the desert
regions of the State during the last two
months. That such a condition might be
averted,, and expecting a great influx of
prospectors ;to the southwestern portion
of/ Nevada and the southeastern portion
of California. .". State Mineralogist Aubury.
a "personal knowledge \u25baof the ter
rltory r "bovered, by j the present . stampede,
drqw." up Assembly: bill No., 1174,^ which
passed and ' \u25bawas signed by Governor
Pardee.
The act provides for the. appropriation
of J5OOO, ; for the purpose of .procuring
metallic guide posts to be erected in the
desert'sections of California, and particu
larly, in the counties, of Kern, Ventura,
Lo.-* Angeles., Inyo, Riverside, San Ber
nardino and San Dleso. upon which are
to be indicated the distance and direction
of wells,. sorings. and tanks of water fit
for drinking purposes. Other information
of value will be contained on the posts.
,-'-'lt will be thus seen that the State has
made amble provision for the purchase
of the metallic guide poster,", said Aubury
yesterday, "and it only remains for the
counties to be benefited to attend to their
erection."'
At the convention of Supervisors of the
various counties, held in San Diego in
April, Aubury consulted with representa
tives of the counties interested and it was
â¢agreed unanimously that every 'effort
would be i expended toward having the
posts erected tmmediately. . The- State
mineralogist, in view of apparent \u25a0 apathy
in the: matter, has again communicated
with the different Boards of Supervisors
and has once more urged that some im
mediate action be taken so as to prevent
a recurrence of the large number of
fatalities.
The wonderful mineral discoveries in
the ' sections named have caused a "rush
of prospectors to those parts and a ma
jority of those going are uninformed as
to the dangers of the desert at this time
of the year.
Aubury, having spent several years In
the desert, is alive to the terrible suffer
ing that must overtake those who ven
ture without the slightest knowledge- of
the topography of the country. He feels
that while the appropriation is there for
good use it is nothing less than a crime
to delay . putting up the guides. He
blames the counties and not the Scate,
which he admits has done its part by
supplying the funds.

George Sweet, a molder, lies- at his

George MlOler, a 'â¢Â« oainter-: :.. The assault
was '- committed Jn :\u25a0 Sweet's *- home, 240%
Sixth street, late Saturday night, and had
it not been for -the interference of neigh
bors, who were attracted to the scene
by Sweet's cries for mercy, he might
have- been killed. Miller was arrested
shortly after the \u25a0 affair. ;
Miller formerly lived with the Sweets,
but has for the last three months been
staying at the house of Mrs. Jacobs. 410 A
Tehama street. Miller and Mrs. Jacobs
called "at Sweet's home Saturday night.
No one was In >. the house when the visi

leged that Miller was intoxicated and
during an argument knocked Sweet down
and then unmercifully kicked his victim.
"Witnesses say that Mrs. Jacobs stood
by and 'witnessed the affair without at
tempting to call help.

Â»w York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. July 24.â The action of to
day's stock market was strongly eugrestive
of the inference that the considerable tjeU'.ng
which broke prices en Saturday was from pro-
1 fessicnal Â£ear sources asd that it was not
i IT' r L rs.i r l)l Ja dislodging much stock for the
purpose of covering *hort contracts. The de
mand for covering during the first hour of
t--.-day's session was Eharp and sent price*
upward with quite a strong Impetus. This
movement was largely proiapted. no doubt,
by a revision of views over the wheat dam
ape ar.d over the danger of an anthracite
miners' strike which were prevalent on Satur
day. The large amount of wheat that ap
prared for sale, the special weakness of the
market for that commodity In the Northwest
and the reports of. fine weather over the spring
â¢wheat bet were the materials of evidence
a.j?air.Et Saturday's crop scare. An additional
Â«:eir.:-r.t was the very confident tone of rall
r-ad officials in their reg-ular weekly talks
over traffic outlook - regarding the feeling in
their respective territories as reflected In prep
erat:ors for future business. A general dis
position was reported on the part of merchants
t â¢ co ahead with plans baÂ«ed oa expectation
of a favorable outcome of the crons. The
rate differences having to do with certain
o!asses of freight as between the gulf and
Atlantic port Ur.es asd with passenger rate*
F.rr.cng the trunk lines were treated as of
rrinor consequence. The alarm over the labor
cutlook in the coal fields was declared to be
\u25a0facetious on account of the remoteness of
the fixing of a new agreemrnt. These were
X principal factors, without doubt, tn the early
â¢â¢ coveries of prices. Reports of large buying
â¢ i rails and #tructural steel produces werÂ«
a favorable influence on this list generally
nr.d on the United States Steel stocks spe
cifically. In the case of the latter there
m also a disposition to anticipate a good
effect from the favorable showing of the
esminjrs for the July quarter, which It ts
quite commonly expected will be revealed t>y
the Quarterly 6tatement of earnings to be
sriven out by the corporation to-morrow. The
money market continued very easy in eplti
of the lessened strength Â©f the banking posi
tlcr. ilisclosed fey the weekly bank statement.
The large influence played by the Japanese
funds ca deposit here in tae current ease of
money is regarded with some solicitude owing

option there showing at one time a ' loss of

that durlnj a drive of forty ; miles .- he - had
failed to discover ' any signs of black rust.
Fresh reports of rust were received, but they
lacked dennlteness. Boars . were "given addi

movement over new wheat In the Southwest.
After the first rush 10 sell wai over , the
market held comparatively steady, the price
for September during the remainder of the

fa'"' : V> % : ''jy Dear Mrs. Pinkham:-
troubled' vrith a
\ r tumor, which kept
great mental depression. I was unable to at-,
tend to my house work,and life became a bur-
den to me. I was confined for da ys to my bed,
lost my appetite, my courage and all hope.
*' I could not bear to think of an operation,
and in my distress I tried every remedy which
I thought would be of any use to me, and
reading of the value of Lydia E. Pinknam's
Vegetable Compound to sick women decided
to' give it a trial. I felt so discouraged that I
had little hope of recovery, and when I began
to feel better, after the second week, thought
it only meant temporary relief; but to my
great surprise I found that I kept gaining,
while the tumor lessened in site
" The Compound continued to build up my
general health and the tumor seemed to be
absorbed, until, in seven months, the tumor
was entirely gone and I a well woman . lam
so thankful for my recovery that I ask you
to publish my letter In newspapers, so other
women m*y know of the wonderful curative
powers of Lydia EL Pinkbam'a Vegetable
Compound."
When women are troubled with irreg-
nlar or painful menstruation, weakness,
leucorrhoea, displacement or ulceration
of the womb, that bearing-down feel-
ing 1 , inflammation of the ovaries, back-
ache, flatulence, general debility, indi-
gestion and nervous prostration, they
should remember there is one tried and
true remedy. Lydia E . Pinkham's Veg-
etable Compound at once removes such
trouble. *
No other, medicine in the world has
received such widespread and unquali-
fied endorsement. No other medicine
has" such a record of cures of female
troubles. Refuse to buy any other
medicine:
Mrs. Pinkh am invites all sick women
to write her for advice. She has guided
thousands to' health. Address,' Lynn,
Mass. - . . ' .'^
Health is too valuable to risk in ex-
periments "with unknown and \u25a0 untried .
medicines or methods, 'of i treatment. \u25a0
Remember that it is Lydia E. Pinkha m's
Vegetable . Compound that is curing;
women, and don't allow any "druggist
to sell you anything else in its place. ' ','
TELLS OF DEATH
OF HER FATHER
Little Ethel Schultze De
scribes to Jury Hcrw Pound
. man Scherf Murdered Him
PEOPLE'S CASE CLOSED
Defense Opens at Trial Be
fore Judge Lawlor and
Several Witnesses Testify
Little Ethel Schultze was a pathetic
figure when she appeared in Judge
Lawlor's court yesterday to testify as
a witness at the trial of Gustave
Schorl, deputy poundkeeper, for the
murder of her father, Rudolph W.
Schultze, In front of his residence on
Fifth avenue South on August 24. She
spoke in a quiet, subdued voice, which
sometimes choked with emotion. The
defendant kept his eyes fixed upon her
while his aged mother sat beside. him
with bowed head.
The little girl testified that she was
looking out of the window when she
saw the pound wagon drive up to
within a few feet of the house. Two
men jumped from the wagon and one
caught her pet dog and walked with it
toward the wagon. Just then her
father came out of the shop and ap
peared to be expostulating with the
poundma'n, who then threw a net over
his head.
"The poundman laughed loudly," she
said, "as papa got more and more
tangled up in the net and fell. I ran
downstairs to the front door to save
my dog. Just as I reached the porch
I saw papa stagger toward the front
steps and fall at the bottom writhing
In pain. I looked toward the pound
wagon and saw the defendant stand
ing up with a smoking pistol In his
hand. Then the wagon drove away as
I hurried to where papa was 'ylng.
Papa knew that he was dying and he
said. 'Kiss me. Ethel.' I- threw my
arms around his neck and kissed him
and he fell back' dead."
Henry Stahlecker. . a boy: Henry
Carnduff, Jesse C. Stewart and Albert
J. aiilly gave testimony to the' effect
that they saw the defendant fire the
shot at Schultze and the prosecution
rested its case. .
For the defense Detective C. J. Cody
testified that he arrested the defendant,
whose explanation was that he had
fired the shot in self-defense. Police
man J. T. Bates and Sergeant John M.
Lewis were questioned as to a 44-cali
ber revolver that was found in the
wagon with which the defendant
claimed he fired the shot. Charles
Weintraub, deputy poundkeeper, who
was -with the defendant at the time of
the shooting, admitted that he had lied
to the officers when he told them the
shooting was done with a 44-callber
weapon and said that the 38-caliber
weapon which Scherf had in his pocket
had been put in a bag- of meat in the
wagon and was found there next morn-
Ing by Deputy Murphy. The defense
will be continued this morning. .- .
DEFECTIVE ELEVATOR' "
CAUSES A 3IAN'S DEATH
Shoota Upward Instead of Descending;
and Crashes Carpenter McCormlck
Against Topmost Celling.
Charles McCormick, an aged car
penter, employed by the Pacific Stamp
ing and Metal Works, 133 Davis street,
was instantly killed last Sunday after
noon by. being mangled in the freight
elevator of the establishment. He had
worked upvto 5 p. m. on Sunday and it
is presumed that the accident occurred
while he was attempting to go from
the third floor'to the ground floor. The
machine had been out of order for some
time and it Is believed that McCormick
pulled the lever of the freight elevator
to descend and. that the cage shot up
ward instead of downward and crushed
his ribs against the top ceiling of the
building. â¢ The body was found on the
floor of the cage yesterday morning at
7 o'clock by William H. Howard, an
employe, who started to use the ele
vator.
E. E. Buffington, secretary of the Pa
cific Stamping and Metal Works, in
formed Deputy Coroner Meehan that
the elevator had been out of order for
a long time and that he had notified
the landlord to that effect prior to the
accident.
McCormick was a native of Massa
chusetts and 60 years old. He lived
with his wife and family at Fruitvale.

When the beefy right / hand of Fred
Brankschulte landed heavily upon the
left eye of his helpmeet, Carrie, his, soul
sickened with mingled -pity and. chagrin,
for the blow .was not intended for her. .-, It
was aimed, at the face <?f' his brother
Henry, whose adroit sidestepping saved
his countenance from damage and re
sulted in the discoloration of his sister
in-law's optic, she being close behind him
when Fred's fist shot out to injure.
According to Fred's story, as narrated
to Police Judge Fritz, the conduct of
Henry justified the attempt to batter him.
He had acquired an â¢ annoying habit of
meddling In his brother's domestic af
fairs, obtruding his counsel when" It was
not desired and- fomenting little marital
tilts until they became most serious
squabbles. " His unsolicited advice was
invariably rebuked by Fred, - = but Carrie,
being of more pliable mentality, rather
welcomed It and seldom failed to abide by
It. Thus the condition stood last Sunday
evening, when Fred, who had departed
from his home, 944 Howard street, early,
in the, day, after.. "having /words*/ with
Carrie,' returned at nightfall Uo "find her
and Henry sipping beer and telling each
other, how much nicer things would have
been if they had /happened otherwise.
They" coldly ignored Fred's presence un
til he commanded Henry to depart,
whereupon Carrie figuratively took up the
cudgels 'for her brother-in-law and re
quested providence to inform: her why
her husband was not equipped with simi
lar beauty of temperament instead, of
being provided with stellar- ability, to
"nag", and make life unpleasant for all
connected, wlth.hlm. V Then It was' that
Fred, perceiving , the effect 'of : Henry's
counsel upon Carrie's mind, aimed at
Henry's face the blow which landed upon
Carrie's eye.
Patrolmen Crowley and Rooney, who
arrested the trio and booked them for
peace disturbance, told Judge Fritz that
the rumpus . was in full blastâ Carrie
screaming, Henry flodglng and Fred pur
suing â when they entered the domicile.
Then the husband and . wife jj were dis
missed and Henry; was \u25a0given, twenty-four,
hours' Imprisonment and \ instructed to
visit his brothers- home no, more.-'
Frank Owens, young - and ; stalwart,
pleaded that he Was | driven %to \u25a0 street
begging by destitution^ he having squan
dered In riotous living the savings which
he brought from I the Placer. -County
mines, where he Jihad labored
and lived abstemiously for, many months.'
When he was requested -to -display his
hands, however, the palms .which, hejheld
forth for , Judge. Fritz's ' Inspection- were
soft as an Infant's. \* ; * ._;.!'
"Mining must be â¢ a gentle art," sighed
his Honor, with a reproachful 'glance at
Mr.' Owens' imperturbable countenance.
"Mining," was.- the ; response, "is a
tough jo.b, but I was employed in the
cookhous"e." . , .: ;
"They may, find 'use for you in the
kitchen of the jail in; which you will
spend the next twenty days," said, the

early hour yesterday morning. T His vo

not understand why he did it. g|
"It doesn't make much difference what
you do with me, anyhow," he said to

Grading of City Lot * at
20th and Kentucky Streets
"The Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors yesterday cotapleted ar
rangements for- borrowing 100 voting
machines from the United States Stand
ard Voting Machine Company. Frank
Jordan, Pacific Coast representative of
the company, appeared before the com
mittee and explained that the Election
Commissioners were averse to accept
ing the loan for fear that they would
be held personally, responsible for any
damage . resulting to the ' machines
from their use. The appropriation for
election expenses was reduced by some
$12,000 on the assumption that the ma
chines would be loaned to the city.
The Finance Committee informed Jor
dan th.at the city would be responsible
for any damage and Jordan Immediate
ly telegraphed to his company to manu
facture the machines for immediate de
livery. The 100 machines to be loaned
are. In addition to the eighty pur
chased outright, by the Election Com
mission last Friday at $650 each. Next
year- the money for the purchase of the
borrowed . machines will .be appro
priated. The city will have 220 voting
machines to carry on the next munici
pal" election, forty having been bought
last year. \u25a0 Jordan says the company's
factory will work night and day to fill
the big order.
The Auditor was authorized -by the
Board of Supervisors to appoint thirty
additional clerks for a period of thirty
days.
The board passed to print an ordi
nance ordering the removal of the bluff
and the grading of city, property at
Twentieth anl, Kentucky streets at an
estimated cost of $7500.
The contract to furnish three street
flushing machines was awarded to the
Sanitary Machine Company for $3000.
The offer of C. S. Harney to furnish
ten-sprinkling wagons at $2 47 per day
each was rejected and the clerk was di
rected to advertise for bids for. the
purchase of \u25a0 ten new machines.
D'Ancona suggested that the Mayor
recommend to the. Board of Works that
the machines be paid for out of .the
street cleaning fund, as the rentals
exacted would more than pay for them

MOKAN SEEMS" TO BE
SUEE OF APPOINTMENT
Civil Service Board Secretary
Likely to Secure Jacant
Coinmissionersliip.
Although Mayor Schmitz said yester
day .that he had not .made up his mind
as to the appointment to the vacancy
created by the resignation of Civil
Service , . Commissioner * Rogers, | indica
tions point strongly to. the selection of
Edward F. Moran fos the place. . \u25a0
Moran Is now secretary of the Civil
Service Board . and the Mayor believes
he is well qualified for. the Comiqis
sionership because of his familiarity
with the details of the office. Moran
has brought some strong political back
ing to bear, Rogers himself, who is now
curator, of the Park Museum; having
advanced the claims of his former sub
ordinate to be his successor.
\u25a0 Another factor , which . may cause
Moran to be promoted is that his ap
pointment to the Commissionership will
result In a vacancy in the secretaryship
of the board, : which pays a salary of
$200 per month. This will permit of
the appointment of a man in favor with
the Schmitz administration. Who that
man is has not yet developed, but there
will be.no dearth; of candidates in the
event of v- Moran's . promotion. Moran
himself is .willing: to accept the higher
honor with , a 'decrease of $100 i monthly
in his salary because he desires to prac
tice law, which, he cannot do In his
present position of secretary of the
board.

From Owners of Block 177
to-Sell Property to City
LAND FOX NEW SCHOOLS
Lot on Frederick Street Is
Purchased for Erection of
; Polytechnic High Building
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution rejecting the ofT^r
of owners to sell SD-vara block Noi iz$ t
bounded by "Powell, Stockton, Filbert
and' Greenwich streets a3 a site Tor a
children's playground at North Beach.
The City Attorney was directed to so
licit offers from the owners of block.
177 r bounded by Mason. Taylor. ChesB^
nut and Francisco streets for the sale
of- their- lands, the block named having
been selected as an alternative site for
the playground. .
The offer of the City Realty Com
pany to sell for; $65,000 the lot of land
In the block bounded by Frederick.
Carl and ' First \u25a0 avenue as -a site for
the new Polytechnic High School was
accepted and a demand was ordered
drawn for the amount.
The offer of the Pope Estate Com
pany to sell for $28,500 a block bound
ed by Shrader. Grattan and Alma
streets as a site for a new school was
accepted.
The sum of $2700 was set aside to
make a preliminary investigation of
the three sources of water supply of
fered to tUe city in order to enable
the BoaÂ«T of Supervisors to determine
tho value of either of them as a per
manent supply.
The City Attorney was requested to
solicit offers for the sale^to the city of
two lots on Montgomery street, near
Lombard, for the preservation of Tele
graph Hill under an appropriation of
$25,000 for the purpose.
The roadways of. Howard street be
tween Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth
and Twenty-third street' between
Church and Vlcksburg, were fully ac
cepted.
A resolution was adopted segregat
ing the taxes levied for bond redemp
tion and Interest funds into respec
tively 8.41 cents and .99 cents.
The sum of 5750 was set aside to put
the city's wires on Mission street, fronv
Second to Fifth, underground.
The Finance Committee ordered two
hydrants to be Installed on B street to
connect with the "mains of the Olympic
Salt Water Company. A representative
of the company insisted on the pay
ment of 51 for each hydrant monthly
before turning on the salt water, claim
ing that its franchise required it to
] furnish water for twenty-five hy
drants which were already installed on
Point Lobos avenue and Geary street
for flushing sewers and to extinguish
flrea. ,
It developed that the company Is re
quired by the franchise to file sworn
statements of Its gross receipts yearly
when the Board of Supervisors shall
call on It for the same, but this pro
vision has never been complied with.
The, company is also required to pay
2 per cent of Its gross receipts for salt
water sold to the Inhabitants of the
city. The company's representative
said such receipts would not exceed
$500 monthly, which caused Supervisor
Brandensteln to remark that the com
pany owed the city $120 for last year.
The water will be turned on tn the two
hydrants described and the Question of
whether, the city shall pa-y $2 monthly
: therefor will be settled hereafter.

they have cured where other formulas
