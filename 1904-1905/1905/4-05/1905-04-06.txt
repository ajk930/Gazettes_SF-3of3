REVOLTING MURDER WRAPPED IN MYSTERY
JEREMIAH F. DINAN IS APPOINTED CHIEF OF POLICE
THE policr arc aghast at the fiendishness of a murder
lfcat was committed last night. The mystery wrapped
about the crime has completely baffled their wits. The trunk
oÂ£ a human body, decapitated and limbless and not yet cold,
was foand in the doorway o f a lodging-house near the cor
ner of Powell and Vaiiejo streets. There remains no mark
of identificaiion. The murderer was seen to throw his burden
is the doorway, but, though he was followed a short distance,
nodwr whatever was obtained to his identity.
TRUNK OF HUMAN BODY
IS FOUND IN DOORWAY
No Mark of Identification and No
Clew to Perpetrator of the
Horrible Deed.
Passerby Says He Saw Man Dis
pose of Grewsome Bundle and
Walk Slowly Away.
Carrying the bleeding body of a man,
from â which the head and limbs had
. been hacked off, an unknown man
* Walked calmly down Vallejo street last
. night- His burden excited suspicion,
i though, and he dropped the ghastly
' /o*d on the stairway of the Bellevue
â¢lodging house, SOI Vallejo street.
George Oliva followed him to Washing-:
â¢ ton -SQuare, where he lost sight of him
â¢ arrr^ng: the shrubbery, .' ' --'.^ â¢^.-*.-.'
:' The body'was^ra^ed^in^red blan
ket. It was still warm and quivering
â¢ â¢when un-w rapped. : The blood that
â¢ gushed from the horrible mass was ab
â 'eorbed by a woolen shawl that was j
fastened. close around it.
Two boys who saw the man drop the j
bundle ran up to where it fell and j
started to open it. One of them, George
â¢ Carpertine, thrust his hand beneath
the blanket and touched something I
j soggy and warm. He drew his hand *
"out. covered with blood. â¢*~rCs& Â»
The boys shrieked In terror and.sum
.. moned Policemen Minnehan and Con
'. nolly. who immediately notified the
."Central station, and Detectives Bralg
" and Coleman and Sergeant Brophy,
â¢ -.with a posse, immediately began to
. 6cour the neighborhood. They could
not find the i-hadow of a clew to the i
murderer or the identity of the mur
dered man.
The man who bore the ghastly bur
den wag first seen by George Ollva at
about 10:20. He was carrying the bun
dle on his back along Mason street. He
crossed from the east side toward Val- i
lejo. â¢> :va. who had been walking be
hind him, felt some vague suspicion
" -wlren the man suddenly turned and
walked down Yallejo. Oliva decided to
follOW him. .--.\.r>';
The man with the bundle quickened
his pace and Ollva hurried after him.
As the man dove Into the shadow of
the Bellevue House he dropped his bur
den !n the doorway and hurried down
Vallejo street.
. Then Oliva decided that his suspi
cions were Justified and kept on his
trail. The fellow walked on rather
hurriedly until he came to Washington j
square. There Oliva lost sight of him
behind Borne Fhrubbery. Ollva retraced }
his steps to where the bundle had been
dropped and learned that a horrible
crime had been committed.
Detectives Braig and Coicman pro
cured a lantern and tried to strike a
trail of blood spots., but the mutilated
S trunk had been so carefully packed
' that the blood had been drunk by the
wrappings. The police scoured the
neighborhood bearing lanterns. Every i
alley and doorway for blocks - around
i was searched, but no clue was found.
The body was that of a Caucasian.
The head, arms and legs had . been
hacked off. The shawl was tied tightly
around it and the red blanket cover
ing the ghastly bundle had been
wrapped closely.
Within a half-hour before the terrible
find was made the man -was living, as ;
Fhown by the quivering of the trunk
when the police reached the place
where It lay. This proves that the crime
Tva* committed In near vicinity of ;
where the bearer of. the ghastly burden j
.was first seen.
In, the short time that thev had to
consider the detectives, guessed * three I
motives, revenge Inspired by loss of a
woman's love, a maniac's work or the
hand of the Mana. How the butchery
happened, where it happened, the po- '
lice are working almost feverishly to ;
digcover.'jpS&lBj
The boldness of it -leads the detee- '
iives to think that it was a maniac's
<5eed." OHva raid that though the
man quickened pace when he saw
Â«hat hrÂ» was followed, he did not ap
pear. â  excited.- * He walked steadily]
bending slightly under, his load of !
i
All description of the man is lacking.
All that Ollva, can tell is that, he was
*bbrt in stature .and \ wore dark cloth-;
ing.
The burden he carried: seemed to!
have tired : m, tor a* ; Ollva followed I
niw.-he could hear the, man ; pan; with!
exertion. 'JxStSBBtgQk !
It was shortly after 10:30 o'clock
â Â« hen George Carpertine â and j; Carlos â¢
Tones, boys who live in the" neighbor- i
hood, saw the man drop the bundle in 1
the doorway. After the.man had gone j
f about a block, followed by 'Oily a, they]
ran up to the doorway and began to in- 1
â¢â¼estimate the find ' ', '
The San Francisco Call.
"We were frightened to death,", said
Torres. . "I saw the thing Â» moving.
When Carpertine opened the blanket
I Â«aw the thing twitch as though it was
alive. There was an awful -gash where
the arm- had- been. -
"We shouted and the policemen came.
It ; was the most terrible thing 1 ever
saw. The ehawl waÂ» lifted a little,
and .when it fell it was. soggy- with
blood. You could hear it ' fall j with a
soppy sound."' ', . â '- v \ v ; .* ) 5 j~: - t '^% >
. The T pavement wasl smearÂ« 4 with
red, where the thing lay. The crowd â 
from the* Bell&vue House 1 crowded
around it, but , when . the dim light
from Detective, Bralg's lantern fell on
ths ghastly . thing the crowd shrank
back. ,
. "Worse than any Whitechap'el mur
der,"" was the comment. ,
The body was taken to the Morgue
and the police continued their search
throughout the night with no success. ]
Blood stains were found near a
lamppost m'here the man with the
bundle crossed Vallejo street from the
north side to the south. But the
bloody trail ended abruptly. , .
"My God," said Detective Braig,
panting from his exertions, "if we only
had a bloodhound. A bloodhound could
catch that trail. We could find out
where the deed . was committed, any
how. If we had one."
Oliva gives the following account of
the affair: "I saw the man first at the
top of the hill at Mason and Vallejo
streets. I followed him because I did
not like the looks of the fellow and his
bundle. . '
"He went down Vallejo street on the
north side. When he came to a lamp
post there he . turned across the street
and dropped the thing and kept on
down Vallejo street. â 
. "I knew there was something up, so
I kept after him. I wanted to see
where he would go. He walked along
to Union street and stopped in the
park.
- "I walked on without turning, so as
not to frighten him off. When â  I
turned again he -was- gone. - I. did not
get a look at his face at all. 'I don't
even know what | color 1 his j hair j was,'
or. whether he looked young or old.
He was rather short."
Two gripmen of the -Powell-street
line tell stories of ; having seen sus
picious appearing men board their
cars shortly before midnight. Accord-
Ing, to ; the tales of the carmen, the
men were very excited and seemed
anxious to get â¢ out of -the way as
quickly as possible.. â¢ ...
Â« J..C. Cox "says that a man, . wild-eyed
and disheveled, boarded his car at Ma
son and J Vallejo streets. â¢a j block from
whare the : body, was found. According
to Cox. the man was excited and sus
picious and kept his. eyes on , the -pas
sengers till he jumped off the car in a
hurry at Francisco street and. disap
peared in the darkness. â  - : â¢ â¢
It is. not thought that this could be
the man who had the bundle. It would
have been .impossible for him to have
.boarded the car v at Meson' and Vallejo
streets had he been going in the' direc
tion of Washington square, as - related
by OJiva.
Gripman Carson of .the Powell
street line tells astory of having seen
four suspicious: appearing men board
his car at Mason street. They were, all
excited and kept talking among them
selves in low tones. -;, The ; gripman
slowed up near Filbert street, and one
of the men said, "Hurry up, there.
Let her go." They alighted a moment

SAN FRANCISCO. THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 1005.
PAUL JONES'
BODY RESTS
IS SCOTLAND
Aged Woman oi Red
lands Clears a
Mystery.
Grave ol tbe Famous Naval
Hero Is in the Town
of His Birth.
Much lime and Money Wasted in a
Futile Search in Cemeteries
of France.
Suecial Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PATL. Minn., April s.â Joseph A.
Wheelock, editor in chief of the Pio
neer Prees and one of the best known
newspaper men in the West, has dis
covered that John Paul Jones is not
burled in Paris, as supposed, but in
Dumfries. Scotland. In a dispatch from
Redlande, Cal., Wheelock says:
'The long- forgot ten grave of John
Paul Jones, for which Embassador Por
ter has been diligently searching the
old cemeteries of Paris, has been found,
but not there. It Is true he died In
Paris, and it was natural to suppose he
was buried there. But this very reason
able assumption turns out to be incor
rect, as General Porter will be sur
prised to learn as soon as he receives a
letter recently addressed to him by an
old lady, a Scotch woman, Mrs. Preston
by name, who is now and for many
years has been a resident of this place
â Redlands, in Southern California.
"Recently she happened to see in a
newspaper an account of Mr. Porter's
search for the grave of the Scotchman,
whom he is said to regard as the found
er of the American navy in view of his
brilliant record as a sea fighter in our
revolutionary war. Mrs. Preston is a
native of Dumfries, Scotland, which
was the birthplace of John Paul Jones,
and when she saw this story of the Em
bassador's quest she immediately wrote
to him to tell him that the grave of
hia hero was there. She well remem
bered it, for it is marked with a stone
which bears the sinister inscription,
"John Paul Jones, the black pirate.'
"Her story is that Jones' mother
caused his body to be transported from
Paris and buried among the graves of
his kindred in his native village. But
while the mother's affection procured
for him this last privilege of kinship,
it could not protect him from the evil
fame he had acquired among his Scotch
countrymen, especially by his exploits
in the capture and destruction of Brit
ish ships in the neighboring seas and in
raiding the coast towns of the British
Isles. He had not spared Dumfries
itself â the home of his childhood. In
the eyes of the good people of that
quiet burg this Paladin of the seas was
a graceless rebel and buccaneer, and so
it is no wonder that they vented their
pent village wrath upon his memory in
the awesome epithet of 'the black pi
rate,' which they carved upon his tomb
stone."
During the search for the body of
Jones, which has continued for many
months and is still in progress, a num
ber of graves In French cemeteries
have been opened. Several times it was
believed the last resting place of the
great naval hero had been found, but
each time close investigation resulted
in disappointment. During the recent
session of Congress an unsuccessful at
tempt was made to obtain an appro
priation for the continuance of the
search. The appropriaton was favored
by the President. When the bill was
defeated several French societies and
associations of Americans in FrancÂ»
raised funds by subscription for thÂ«
continuance of the work.
TRIES TO KILL
JAIL OFFICIAL
REDDING, April h. â Harold Fish
er, an insane man, who is confined In
the City Prison here, to-day made a
furious attack on T. W. Pemberton,
a deputy sheriff, when that officer en
tered hiÂ» cell to administer to his
wants. When Pemberton opened the
door Fisher sprang upon him and
fastened hi 3 fingers on the officers
throat. After a struggle of several
minutes, Pemberton, who was weak
ening from want of breath, managed
to free himself and knocked the in
sane man to the floor with his club.
Pemberton was so weak that he could
scarcely get oat of the door before
Fisher was upon him again. Later
Floher became so violent that he had
to be strapped to his bed to prevent
him from injuring himself. He will
be taken to Napa in a few days.
ANNOUNCES POLICY
HE WILL FOLLOW
WHILE IN OFFICE
THE new Chief an
nounces his policy as
follows:
It will be my constant aim
and endeavor while I am
Chief of Police to make the
police force efficient. Police
men are paid for protecting
life and property â for pre
venting and suppressing crime.
This is the primary object of
all police service. Policemen
should always appear neat
and clean, but the matter of
dress should never stand In
the way of effectual police
work.
Under my administration
policemen of all ranks will
receive all reasonable encour
agement in their efforta to
perform honest and effective
police work, and they will
never be in doubt that their
efforts are appreciated.
I believe that the efficiency
of the police force can be
greatly improved by vesting a
supreme command in the va
rious captains of police of the
districts. This will be done,
and the responsibility of each
captain will be measured by
the scope of his authority.
The same rule will be made to
extend to lieutenants, ser
geants, corporals and patrol
men. While I remain at the
head of the Police Depart
ment the laws will be en
forced as they are written.
If any existing law is wrong
the only remÂ»viy for the peo
ple is to repeal or amend It.
As some puhlic comment
hag been made concerning
proposed chunges in the per
sonnel of the detective and
clerical staffs at police head
quarters, I will say that no
changes will be made at
present. If any change rhould
be made in the future it will
be made for the good of the
public service, and for that
reason only. So far as the
detective bureau is concerned,
I will give great consideration
to the suggestions of the cap
tain of detectives.
He Obtains a Leave
of Absence From
Former Place.
Says No Immediate
Changes Are to
Be Expected.
San Francisco has a new Chief of
Police. Jeremiah F. Dinan. for many
years a sergeant of detectives, has suc
ceeded George W. Wittman. The Po
lice Commissioners named the new of
ficial last night. As the appointment
had been expected for many weeks,
it was not the occasion for surprise.
Dinan's appointment was unanimous,
for the Commissioners had agreed
upon him long since. He would have
been named at the last meeting of the
board but for the fact that he wanted
to make ' sure of protecting himself
against removal entirely from the Po
lice Department by a hostile board.
To make his position safe he asked for
rf leave of absence as a detective ser
rfeant for a year, which the Commis
sioners granted before they made the
appointment.
A full house turned out to srreet the
new Chief. After he had been sworn
into office there was loud cheering.
When the noise had stilled and every
one was waiting for something else to
happen, a voice with a decidedly Hi
bernian accent called out. "Good boy.
Jerry." Even the Commissioners dis
played broad smiles when they heard
the salute.
No successor to Dinan was named.
It was rumored that Commissioner Rea
gan's son would get the billet, but the
board decided to hold the place open.
Rumor also had it that Detective Baln
bridge. head of the identification de
partment, would be retired on a Den
slon and that Sergeant Norman of the
Chiefs office would take his Dlace,. but
n<> action was taken in regard to these
positions either.
NEW CHIEF IS CHEERED.
The Commissioners took their seats
shortly after 7:30 and after an hour
had been spent in discussing minor
matters such as permits and licenses.
Secretary George Boyne read the fol
lowing resolution, which was intro
duced by Commissioner Reasran and
adopted unanimously:
"Resolved, That Jeremiah F. Dinan,
police officer and detective sergeant in
this department, be and he hereby is
SAN FRANCISCO'S NEW CHIEF OF POUCH. WHO WAS APPOINTBD LAST NIOHT BY THE ODMMISS ION EKS TO 3ERVJJ

granted leave of absence from his du
ties as such police officer and detective
sergeant for the period of one year
from this dÃte. without pay."
The glances of the spectators were all
turned toward the door of the room af
ter the reading of the resolution.
Every one expected to see Dinan make
his appearance, hut the crowd was nils
taken, for the sergeant of detectives
did not enter till the final moment had
arrived. ,
Three-quarters of an hour elapsed
before the door opened and Dinan
strode proudly toward the platform.
I.oud cheers greeted him as ho took his
stand in front of the Commissioners.
The members of the board greeted him
cordially and a few friends stepped to
the front to extend their congratula
tions, after which Secretary Boyne read
the following resolution:
"Resolved. That Jeremiah F. Dinan
be and he is hereby appointed Chief of
Police of the city and county of San
Francisco, to hold office for the term of
four years from this date, pursuant to
the provisions of chapter IV. article
IX of the charter of said city and
county. THOMAS F. REAGAN."
PRESIDENT POHEIMS SPEECH.
This was the Hlgnal for another out
break of applause. Dinan assumed a
modest pose and cast his eyes on the
floor while the multitude cheered.
President Poheim was the first to break
the silence. He arose and addressed
the newly appointed Chief as follows:
"Mr Dinan. we have the honor to
night to appoint you Chief of Police of
the city and county of San Francisco,
it is one of the hardest positions I
know of for any man to fill, as the re
sponsibilities are gTeat. I trust that

flee In the manner I believe you are
capable of. You have been a member
of the police force for a good many
years and during that time you have
always been an exemplary officer, so I
feel assured that you will make a good
Chief of Police and do your duty faith
fully and well."
Dinan waÂ« again cheered when he
arose to speak. "Gentlemen," said he.
"I appreciate the position of truÂ»t in
which you have placed me and all I
have to say is that I will do all in my
power to give a good adminstratton.
and will perform the duties of Chief
of Police to the best of my ability. I
feel assured that I will be In a position
to gerve the people faithfully."
Dinan was then sworn in aa the head
of the Police Department. Acting Chief
Spillane rose to give Dinan his seat,
but the newly appointed Chief refused
the honor, so another chair was pro
duced and the pair sat side by side to
watch the proceedings.
MAY RESUME OLD JOB.
In granting Dinan a leave of absence
from the department for one year,
without pay, the Commissioners were
protecting the former sergant. Under
this leave Dinan Is eligible to come
back at the end of that time and as
sume hia duties slb a sergeant should
an unfriendly Board of Commissioners
decide to oust him from the Chief's
chair.
It was expected a successor would
be named for Dinan last night, but the
Commissioners failed to take any ac
tion. A well-founded rumor to the ef
fect that Commissioner Reagan's son.
who has beÂ«n a member of the force
but eleven months, is slated for the po
sition was current last night, and when
the Commissioners adjourned without
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
appointing any one in Dinan's place
there was much surprise.
President Poheim stated after the
meeting that Dinan's old job would bÂ«
left open for some time to come. This
would indicate that the Commissioner*
are doing even a titt'e mote to protect
the man they have appointed. Should
the new Chief be ousted he could eaÂ»ily
go bark into his old position, pr-jvidetl
it were left open.
That Dinan did not get the appoint
ment at the last meeting of the board
is no faul T of the Commissioners. They
stood willing and ready to hand him
the plum, but he did not want to take
the new position till he felt assured he
would not lose his standing in the de
parttnent In the <Â»vent ot his removal

Statehood was the President's text at
this place. He told the people that
Indian Territory would probably come
into the Union in a year's time.
"L^t. the children come to the front,"
said the President as the crowd throng
ed about his car; and the children did
come to the front with a rush, the
grown-ups standing by to make room.
The President said, in part:
"I am particularly glad to greet ev
erywhere I have been to-day so many
school children. I need not tell you
that what really counts in any State
is the character of the men and women
who make up that State. You have a
wonderful soil, a wonderful climate.
You are developing great industries.
But all of that will not avail if you
don't have the right type of mÂ«n and
wom<m in the State. That is what
counts. I believe you are getting that
type. I believe you are paying heed
to the education of the young people,
of these boys and girls that I see be

will be running things."

ENTERS FIGHT
AGAINST WILL
Mrs. Mary McAdoo of Knox*
ville Claims Part of the
Estate of Mrs. Gopcevic
PAETY TO THE CONTEST
Says That Property Amount
ing to $600,000 Was
Simply Held as a Trust
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KNOXVILLE, Term., April I.â Mrs.
Mary Floyd McAdoo of this city, the
mother of W. G. McAdoo Jr., of the
Jersey City Tunnel Company, 4s one of
the contestants of the will of Mrs. Har
ry A. Floyd Gopcevic of San Francisco,
who left more than -$600,000 of her for
tune to the street car grlpman whom
she married nine months before her
death. It is said the lawyers for the
i contestants believe the will can be
broken and the big fortune left by the
late Captain R. S. Floyd distributed
among his relatives.
Mrs. McAdoo is one of the two sisters
of Captain Floyd and it is said about
one-third of the estate will go to her
and her children if the will is broken.
One of the grounds of the contest is
the alleged legal disability of Mrs. Gop
cevic to dispose of the $600,000, that
amount having been hers as a trust
to be held for her father's and mother's
relatives. She was given the power to
name the trustees of this fund in her
will, but instead she gave it all to
her husband.
The wiH is contested on the grounds
of alleged undue influence and un
soundness of mind. Miss Floyd, the
wealthy heiress, met Gopcevic while
riding on his car and he is said to have
represented himself to be of noble
birth.

His Death.
T*iÂ« four classes of the Californ
School of Mechanical Arts met sep
arately yesterday to decide what ac
tion should be taken in regard to th
tragic death of Frank Allen, who wat
killed by the accidental falling on h
head of a hammer such as is uae<
In athletic contests on Tuesday after
noon. Allen's classmates of the clas
of '07 directed their secretary to sen<
a note to the mother of their dea<
schoolmate and also to obtain, at som
later time, a fitting memorial. Th
class of '07 will send flowers, an_d th
action will be followed by the othe
classes.
In the afternoon Mr. Merrill, th
principal of the school, addressed th
students and expressed his regret an<
also said that upon reviewing the ac
cident with the president of the boar<
of trustees he had come to the con
elusion that, though it was not th
fault of any one'in particular, It couh
be traced to the error of permittih
the sport of hammer-throwing in th
secondary schools.
After his remarks the meeting re
solVed itself into a joint session of
air the students. That body appoint
ed a committee to formulate resolu
tions and to prepare a fitting me
morial. The school was closed yes
terday, not to be reopened until the
24th inst. The faculty will probably
co-operate with the students to con-?
struct a bronze monument to be pre
pared by the hands of Allen's school
mates.
The funeral servloe will take place
to-day at 1:30 o'clock in the Methodist
Episcopal church at California and

Special Dispatch to The Call
FRESNO, April 6.â After badiy
wounding a burglar with her father's
revolver last night. Miss Odell Bailey,
one of the pretty girls of the Hanford
High School, chased the Intruder
through a parlor window and was pre
paring to follow him wMen the sight
of blood on the curtain overcame her
and she fell in a faint on the floor.
Miss Bailey had been left In charge of
four small children in the home of Mr.
and Mrs. I. P. Bryher, who had gone
on a visit to San Francisco. At mid
night the girl waa awakened by a noise
in an adjoining room. Without wait
ing to clothe herself sne grabbed a
large pistol from under her pillow- and
fearlessly but noiselessly entered the
room where the burglar was at work.
The latter, a big burly fellow, was in
the act of opening a trunk when Miss
Bailey called to him to throw up his
hands. Instead of complying he rushed
at her and she fired at him. With a
yell the wounded man turned back and
dashed through another door. The girl
followed tiring a second and a third
shot. The burglar leaped from the
parlor window and it was then that
Miss Bailey saw the trail of blood he
had left and tainted. Dr. and Mrs. R.
Musgrove, neighbors, were attracted by
the shots and revived the plucky girl.
The arrest of the burglar is expected.
Miss Bailey is the champion tenni*
player of the Hanford High School.
DAVENPORT WINS FIGHT
AGAINST "RECALL" ACT
Supreme Court Says Los Angeles
Councilman Was Not Legally
Removed From Office.
J. P. Davenport, the Los Angeles
Councilman who attained fame
through being a victim of the south
ern city's celebrated "recall act," was
ordered restored to his position by
the Supreme Court yesterday. The
term of office has expired, but Daven
port is entitled to reco\ r er the amount
of his salary from the time of his dis
missal -until he should have retired to
private life in the natural course of
events.
The court does not discuss the con
stitutionality of the act in question,
but sustains the deppsed legislator on
technical grounds. The law provides
that a Councilman who has been
elected in the regular way may be
called upon to again be a candidate if
25 per cent of the voters so request.
He may have served only a month be
fore he is compelled to go before the
people again. Davenport served all
but one month of his term before he
was recalled.
The act provides that the City Clerk
must compare the names of the sign
ers to the petition with the great reg
ister that no fraud may be perpetrat
ed. In the case at bar the Clerk fail
ed to <5o this, so the Supreme Court
declares the proceeding void. Arthur
F>. Hougtoten, who was elected to suc
ceed Davenport, ca.H receive no sal
ary for his services.
Chief Justice Beatty dissents from
the majority opinion because he be
lieves the Clerk's certificate sufficed
to fulfill the requirements of law.
Fitch Says He Was Robbed.
Plenna A. Fitch, a stableman living
at $78 Leland avenue, was discovered
wandering around the vicinity of King
and Third streets early Tuesday morn

Fitch was under the influence of
liquor. He told the policeman that
he had met two young men near
Union Bquara and after having several
drinks with them they robbed him of

Accused of Aid
ing the Smiths
to Escape.
Mrs, Young Has
a Conference
With Rand.
Eped*J DispÂ«.icb to Th* <"*mH
NEW YORK, April 6.â Another
complication In the case of "Nan"
Patterson developed to-day, when, for
*ome reason known only to the Dis
trict Attorney's office, the girl's aged
father, J. Randolph Patterson, was
summoned before the Grand Jury. He
was in the Tombs, talking to his
daughter, when he was told that As
sistant Attorney Rand wished to see
him. He sat in the anteroom of the
Grand Jury room until the assistant
district attorney took him inside,
j where he remained for a half hour.
"When he left he '.vas served with an
other subpena, requiring his attend
ance to-morrow.
Mrs. Margaret Young, widow of
the bookmaker "Nan" is accused of
having killed, walked into the Dis
trict Attorney's office to-day. She was
taken. to Rand's room and for an hour
or more they were in conference.
Rajtd is as secretive about Mrs.
' Young's visit as about the occasion
lor taking Patterson before the Grand
Jury. It was believed, however, that
Mrs. Young had an appointment to
read many >t the letters in Rand's
possession, â .it h had been sent to
"Nan's" sister, Mrs. J. Morgan Smith,
' and her husband before they were
(arrested "in Cincinnati.
Some of the letters may have made
revelations which impelled Rand to
send for "Nan's" father and take him
" before the Grand Jury. The District
Attorney has no reason to believe that
'Patterson was in ignorance of the
â¢ whereabouts of his daughter, Mrs.
Fmith, and her husband at any time
since their disappearance from this
city in June last. Rand has said that
"Nan's" father knew Smith and his
wife had Jeft this city after Hyman
intern, a pawnbroker, had identified
the revolver with which Young was
killed. He also knew where to find
them in a Hoboken hotel, where they
had registered as "L. R. Slocum and
wife," ai:d it was he who took to them
tiie clothing they needed before they j
started on their journey westward.
For this disappearance while under a I
Grand Jury subpena Smith was in
dicted for contempt of court. An at
tempt may be made . to hold Patter
son in contempt, having aided Smith
to escape from the jurisdiction of the
court.
â¢. Conspiracy is the charge on which
the Smiths are held in Cincinnati, and j
"Nan" Patterson was indicted with
j them. It is conjectured that Rand I
has -m^ reason for believing "Nan's" I
father was not ignorant of what his I
daughter and his son-in-law^ were do
i ing and seeks to ascertain just how
far that knowledge" goes.
CINCINNATI. April â The habeas
corpus? hearing of --'J.-- Morgan .Smith i
By.d. wife, arrested last. "week and held
under a New York indictment of con
spiracy with "Nan" Patterson to ex- ;
tort money from "Caesar" Young, the
bookmaker, was to have beeji : held ;
this afternoon before Judge Spiehpl- '
off of thÂ« Common Pleas Court, but on j
request of counsel was again ad- j
journed until next Monday afternoon.
The prisoners were remanded to the
County Jail.

THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL, THURSDAY. APRTL 6. 1905.
GERMAN COURT
UPHOLDS POKER
O&DFWBtTRG, Grand Duchy of
Oldenburg, April s.â Herr Biermann,
editor of the Oldenburg Residenzboten,
was sentenced to-day to a year's im
prisonment for accusing Franz Ruh
stratt IT. Minister of Public Worship.
Education and Justice, of Oldenburg,
of gambling ami alleging that on that
account he was not fit to superintend
the clerical schools and courts. This is
the third sentence imposed on Bier
mann for a similar offense.
The whole German press outside of
the State of Oldenburg has been mak
ing fun over the way public affairs
arc conducted in this little feudal
principalityâ the only one in Germany
without a constitution. Ruhstratt 11,
as he writes his name to distinguish
him from his eoOsiin, Ruhstratt I, the
Oldenburg Minister of Finance, has
been long regarded as the leader of so
ciety at this court, and is an intimate
associate of the reigning Grand Duke,
kuhstratt IT never denied that he
played poker and "jolly seven" at the
Oldenburg Casino, but he affirms the
frames were ,not gambling, and that
poker especially being a game of skill,
in nowise impaired his fitness to direct
the agencies of religion, instruction
and justice.
Several persons, including many po
lice officials, were brought here from
Berlin to testify ns to the nature of
poker. They agreed that, although
judgment was an important element,
it was a p;ame of hazard, and quoted
some American authorities on the sub
ject. In America, it was said, the game
was one very generally engaged in by
respectable persons, who were not, in
consequence, excluded from official life.
The court decided, as already set forth,
that Jt was libelous to attack the Min
ister on such grounds.
PICTURES THE AMERICANS

Russian Press Prints Queer Tales Sent
by Correspondent* in This
Country.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 5. â Queer
ideas of American life are being dis
seminated by American correspondents
of Russian papers. A correspondent
of the Journal de St. Petersburg draws
a rare picture of the dishonesty which
he says pervades the highest circles,
including men, women and children.
He describes the precautions taken by
social leaders to prevent their guests
from being robbed by each other, and
tells of the consternation produced at
a White House reception by a sudden
failure of the lights, the reillumina
tion showing that the ladies had hast
ily divested themselves of their jewels
and concealed them, the men holding
their pocketbooks for fear of being
pounced upon and robbed by neigh
bors.
ITALY GIVES WELCOME

NAPLES, Italy, April 5. â Emperor
William arrived here to-day on board
the steamship Hamburg amid the
booming of cannon and ringing hur
rahs from thousands gathered about
the harbor to greet him. The Duke
of Aosta. eldest cousin of King Victor
Emmanuel, went immediately on
board the Hamburg to welcome the
Emperor in the name of King Victor
Emmanuel, informing the Emperor
that the King will come to Naples to
morrow to see him. Emperor Wil

much at home outside of Germany as
when he is in Italy.
MOROCCO'S
TRADE FOR
ALL LANDS
"Open Door" Must
Prevail, Says the
Kaiser.
Germany's Position Firmly
Outlined to tiie United
States.
No Nation Will Be Permitted to Mon
opolize the Commerce With
the Moors.
WASHINGTON, April s.â Germany
has outlined to the United States in
clear and emphatic terms the position
claimed by the Berlin Government in
Morocco. Upon the receipt of instruc
tions this morning from the
German Embassador called at the War
Department upon Secretary Taft, whom
the President before leaving designated
as the Cabinet officer with whom the
Embassadors should confer, and in the
name of the German Emperor left with
the Secretary a brief memorandum set
ting forth the Moroccan policy which
Germany has all along pursued and
from which she does not intend to be
swerved.
In substance the memorandum, which
is couched in the most explicit lan
guage, announces that "Germany
stands for the 'open door' in Morocco
no less firmly than in the Far East, for
the preservation of the Moroccan status
quo and for the safeguarding and pro
tection of the commercial and trade in
terests in Morocco, not only of Ger
many, but of all the trading nations of
the world."
After presenting the memorandum
the Secretary and the Embassador had
a brief conversation on the subject of
Morocco, Baron Sternburg calling at
tention to the commercial importance
of that country to the trading nations
and emphasizing the international im
portance, in Germany's opinion, of the
preservation there of the "open door."
The Secretary thanked the Embassa
dor for his explicit statement of the
German policy and promptly forwarded
the memorandum to President Roose
velt.
There is no request in the German
note for a Btatenient of the Washing
ton Government's position, and one
reason for its presentation to-day was
the circulation in Europe of sensational
reports about the German Emperor's
visit to Tangier and the German atti
tude toward Morocco.
Although France is not mentioned in
the memorandum, it can be stated that
Germany regrets that she was not of
ficially advised uÂ£ the new position in
Morocco contemplated by Great Britain
and France, which was later disclosed
in the treaty signed last spring, in
which the London Government referred
to the superior interest of France in
Morocco. Germany holds that her in
terests in Morocco are in every respect
equal to those of Great Britain, and
the establishment by any power there
of a special sphere of influence would
be deplored in Berlin.
Regarding the Emperor's visit to
Tangier, although it was in the line
of his cruise in the Mediterranean, the
object of his address was, it can be
stated on high authority, to impress
the Moroccans with the seriousness of
Germany's desire that the status quo
should be maintained and that the
principle of the "open door" laid down
by Secretary Hay with reference to
China should be strictly adhered to in
Morocco.
LONDON, April 6.â The correspond
ent at Tangier of the Times says the
Sultan of Morocco has been given to
understand that he will have no diffi
culty in obtaining a loan In Berlin.
START GRADING
FOR NEW ROAD
Soeclal Dissatch to The Call.
GRANTS PASS, Ore.. April 6.â With
much pomp and ceremony and in the
presence of several thousand people the
first dirt was turned in the grading
of the Medford and Crater Lake Rail
road south of here Tuesday.
The Medford and Crater Lake Rail
road is the first line of rail to push from
the main line of transportation to the
newly established Crater Lake Nation
al Park. This park covers an area of 250
square miles. At present it is eighty
flve miles from the nearest railroad
point, but the new road will put it with
in reach of the thousands of tourists
who cannot at present visit it because
of the long mountain road" that sepa
rates It from the outside world. The
new line will not only tap the park,

SUES MINE
OWNER FOR
MILLIONS
Chicago Woman Says
She Lost Stock
by Fraud. >
Bradsbaw Mountain Copper
Claims in Arizona in
Litigation.
Claim Made. That Output Was Cur
tailed to Frighten Her Into
Selling Her Shares.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April s.â Allegations
purporting to show that a Chicago wid
ow was tricked out of stock said to be
worth 53,000,000 in the Bradshaw Moun
tain Copper Mining and Smelting Com
pany of Prescott, Ariz., are made in a
suit brought by Mrs. Mary J. Hoxie
in the Supreme Court against John L.
Elliott, mining promoter and developer.
It is alleged by Mrs. Hoxie that she
bought the stock in June, 1903, when
the Bradshaw company was in finan
cial distress, for $350,000, the amount to
be paid in installments of $50,000, pro
viding the output of the mine were
300 tons a day. The further allegation
is made that the defendant placed in
charge of the mine an engineer named
Middleton, who kept down the output
of ore to discourage the plaintiff and
force her to dispose of her stock.
Edward M. Shepard is counsel for
Elliott and in his answer before Jus
tice Davis to-day in a motion to vacate
an injunction, he asserted that the
stock had been regularly purchased by
the defendant from the plaintiff for
$300,000 on December 10 last.
The Bradshaw Mountain Mining
Company is said to own one of the
richest copper mines in the wÂ«rld and
Mrs. Hoxie says there is $10,000,000 in
ore in sight. Lawyers fur both sides
agree that the mine can produce 300
tons of ore a day and that its output
will not be exhausted for yea^s to
come. It was set up that Elliott had
paid $300,000 to Mrs. Hoxie for the stock
and as proof of this assertion affida
vits were submitted to the court, pur
porting to show that the stock had
been deposited with the Morton Trust
Company until the sale was effected
and then was turned over to Elliott.
Counsel said that Elliott was the^
owner of the mine and that there was
nothing more in Mrs, Hoxie's suit than
bad advice given to her by a man
formerly connected with the company. .
who is accused of having brought it to
financial embarrassment.
Justice Davis took the papers and
reserved decision.

Siecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April s.â The editor of
the Jewish Daily News announced to
day the. engagement of J. G. Phelps
Stokes, minor son of Anson Phelps

young Jewess who has until recently
been employed as a writer for that
newspaper. She formerly worked in a
Cleveland cigar factory.

latter part of July, according to infor
mation given out to-day by friends of
Miss Pastor. They refused to say
whether or not she would embrace
Christianity prior to her marriage with
Stokes, who is a rigid Episcopalian.
Determined opposition on the part of
the Stokes family has been encountered
because of the young woman's religion.
This is a romance of East Side settle
ment work in which young Stokes has
been engaged for some time. He has
lived at the university settlement
house in Eldridge street and has taken

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
THE JEWS' BEST FRIEND
Thus Asserts Israel Zangwill at
a Zionist Banquet in
London.
LONDON, April 5. â Speaking at a
Zionist banquet in London to-night
Israel Zangwill declared that in the
whole history of the world the Jews
never had a better friend than Presi
dent Roosevelt.
Referring to Great Britain's offer of
territory in East Africa, he said the
bulk thereof might be of use for rear
ing goats, but it was doubtful whether
a settlement 500 miles from the sea
offered sufficient basis for a prosperous
colony.
"If England really wants to offer a
solution of the Jewish question." said
Zangwill, "she should enable them to
expand under self-governing condi
tions over a considerable adjoining
area, so they might be inspired to
colonization on a great scale."

Wilhelm Thanked lÂ»v I'ivsi
dent JKoosevelt for Having
Taken Initiative in Nar
rowing the War District
WASHINGTON. April s.â That it
was upon the suggestion of Emperor |
illiani that President Roosevelt in i
F'bruary of last year undertook to ar- j
range fÂ«<r joint action by the present
neutral powers for the purpose of in- ;
ducing the belligerents in the Far â¢
Eastern war to respect the neutrality j
of China â  for the first time officially I
disclosed in the advance sheets cf For- I
eign Relations made public at tire J.
State Department to-day. It has been J
hinted for a long time that the Ger- j
man Emperor was the initiatory force
in these important exchanges, but it
â has until now been impossible to ob- .
tain any official confirmation of the
fact. !
In the correspondence with Germany I
is included a paraphrase of a cable- j
gram addressed by Secretary Hay to :
Tower, the American Embassador at j
Berlin, <>n February 15, after Ger- :
many's acceptance cf the invitation of I
Secretary Hay had been received di- j
reet from the Embaissador, "to convey |
to the Emperor the President's pro
found appreciation of his generous
initiative and powerful co-operation in
the matter of Chinese neutrality. " ;
The official paraphrase of Tower's re- |
.ply, ted February 17, reads: j
Mr. Tower â â¢. â :> that he conveyed to the
llxnj.oror the profound appreciation of the
President of his Initiative aud co-operation in
tbe matter of Chinese neutrality, and that the
Krr.peror was exceedingly atifled and ex
prt(*od most friendly sentiments toward thÂ«
President. J
It is significant that, in the acknowl- i
edgment of the acceptances by the '
other powers of the programme sug- |
gested by retary Hay in his note '
of February 8, only in the case of Ger
many did the President - send a per- |
sonil message of appreciation to the ,
sovereign. â ,
At the present moment the further j
disclosures in the new volume of For-]
.eign Relations regarding the attitude
of the several powers toward the Hay
proposal of last February are signifi- .
cant. It is shown that Lord Lans
downe. before indicating Great Brit- i
ain'g acceptance, desired to know '
whether Manchuria was included !
within the paraphrase "neutrality of
China." He was answered in general â 
terms that it was the desire of the
Washington Government to secure the '
smallest area of hostilities and the ';
largest possible area of neutrality com- j
patible with the military necessaries j
of the belligerents. . . \ , :
France, through Delcasse, according !
to Embassador Porter's report, while :
receiving the -~ proposal in the best '
spirit, showed a "little anxiety" to >
know the exact significance- of the j
phrase "administrative entity." â  This j
phrase, it can be stated, was. not in- â¢
eluded in Emperor William's sugges- j
tion, which concerned the general |
question of Chinese neutrality, but was '
tht creation of Secretary Hay. Later
France signified her full acceptance. '
Italy preferred to await the views
of the Cabinets at Berlin. Paris and
London before actively participating in .
the plan, and Austria-Huganry was |
equally reticent.

Intense Suffering Prevails
Among the Survivors at
I Military Station to
the Northwest of Simla
CALCUTTA, April s.â Later ac
counts from various cities tell a tale of
severe damage to property arising from
the earthquakes on the morning of
April 4. but it is impossible as yet to
estimate the extent of the loss of life.
It will reach into the hundreds. No
news has yet been received of damage
to buildings at Agra. No loss of life is
reported from Delhi, but many build-
Ings were damaged.
Visitors from Mussoree report con
siderable damage to private property.
It is a curious fact that the older
houses in Mussoree escaped with, less
damage than modern buildings. The
only fatalities yet reported there were
two natives. Many houses were com
pletely demolished. The fissures in the
roads have been closed and repairs to
buildings have been started.
Dharmsala station, eighty-five miles
northwest of Simla, was destroyed, all
the houses in the place being leveled to
the gTOund and some Europeans and
many natives killed. Ladies and chil
dren are sleeping in the open air. Food
is not procurable, as the bazaar is in
ruins. The suffering of the survivors
is Intense. Urgent demands for medical
assistance have been sent to Lahore.
Reports indicate that Dharmsala felt
the full force of the shock. The deaths
include C. W. Loxton, who only the
previous . day had assumed the office
of District Judge, vacated by Captain
Elliott, who with his family left the
game day. escaping the shock.' Mrs.
Loxton's fate is not known. Others
who perished were F. M. Levl, C. T.
Young, T. Miller and F. Farleys, all
public officials; Captain Muscroft, Mrs. j
Robinson: and the two Misses Robin
son. Colonel Robinson is "believed to
have survived.
The hills show, the effects of the
â¢shock, though information is very mea- !
ger from some of the summer stations,
where .telegraph offices have not yet
been ojjened. .
At Frozur. forty miles southeast of
Lahore, Amtritsar, Tarana, Dehra Dun
and Srinagar many natives were killed :
or injured.
Personal stories from Mussoree state
that the reverberation which preceded
the shock will never be forgotten by
those who heard it. The mountains
heaved and swayed a full minute and
then three severe shocks, each lasting
a few seconds, were felt in quick suc
cession. . V 1"V 1 " â  -'
Between 6 o'clock 4n the; morning- of
April 4 and midnlght;there.were twelve
shocks. The day was fine and clear
and moFt of the inhabitants' were al
ready up when the first shock came.
Those who were still in bed described
the motion as being like tKat'of a ship
in a rough sea. whlle^ those on foot
found it impossible to maintain their
balance. Many narrow escapes are re
ported. The effect of the shock in
sickness and dizziness with many still
continues. A number of people slept
outdoors during the whole of last
night. .

Winston Churchill and Other
Speakers Declare That the
Present Government Has
About Run Its Course
LONDON, April s.â The mgst striking
overturning of a Unionist majority
among the numerous recent defeats in
bye-elections was recorded at Brighton
to-day, when Gerald Loder, Unionist,
recently appointed Junior Lord of the
Treasury, was defeated by E. Villiers,
Liberal. Villiers' majority was Â£17.
The Conservative majority at Brighton
in the past twenty years Mas never
less than Loder was seeking re
election at this time on his appoint
ment as Junior Lord of the Treasury.
The election turned almost altogether
on the finance question.
The House of Commons to-night was
the scene of a remarkable demonstra
tion, based upon the defeat of the Gov
ernment candidate for Brighton. While
a somewhat desultory and uninterest
ing debate was dragging on, there was
a rush of opposition members from the
lobbies, shouting with joy over the Lib
eral victory.
"Villjers is in!" was the cry, which
was received with sreat cheering.
Premier Balfour, who was just then
entering the House, was greeted with
shouts of "Resign! resign!" Balfour
quitted the House almost immediately.
On motion to adjourn an extraor
dinary scene occurred. Lloyd-George,
Advanced Liberal, said he had intend
ed to question the Premier on the fate
that had befallen a member of the ad
ministration at Brighton. He com
plained that on receiving notice that
the question would be raised the Pre
mier had* deliberately left the HouseJ
The Premier's discourtesy to the
House, he said, was becoming abso

Several members spoke supporting
Lloyd-George and declaring that the
Government ought to resign.
Winston Churchill said it looked like
the beginning of the end, and that It
was retribution for its shams and shuf

Premier had treated Parliament.

SON OF CHICAGO BANKER
WANTED FOR EMBEZZLEMENT
Max Abrahams, a Jeweler, Obtains a
Warrant for the Arrest of Sid
ney L. Cohen.
Max Abrahams, a jeweler at 126
Kearny street, obtained a warrant
from Police Judge Conlan yesterday
for the arrest of Sidney L. Cohen on a
charge of felony embezzlement. It is
said that Cohen's father is a wealthy
banker in Chicago.
Abrahams alleges that on March 21 \
Cohen called at his store and got a !
gold watch, diamond pin and ring of ;
the aggregate value of $100, which ;
he said he wished to show to a lady j
friend. If the friend did not purchase
the articles they were to be returned, j
Later Cohen called at the store and :
gave Abrahams a check for $100 on;
the First National Bank of Chicago, j
with which he said his father was
connected. The check was dis
honored.
Detectives Dinan and Wren, who
have the case In hand, say that Co
hen has given similar checks to the
management of the St. Nicholas Ho
tel for money he borrowed and his
board bill and also to the manage
ment of the Majestic Theater. Cohen
has been representing himself as be
ing in the theatrical business. He is
expected to arrive by steamer from
Eureka to-day, when he will be ar
rested.
COURT THINKS VANXUOCI'S
ACCOUNT LOOKS PECULIAR
Raffaelo Vannuccl has proved him
self the possessor of so many quali
fications that Judge Kerrigan yesterday
appointed J. F. Tyler referee to ex
amine his last account of his trust as
administrator of the estate of his late
partner, Felice Matteucci. The estate
of the deceased, according to the in
ventory, is worth $27,500, though
Vannuccl says the property was worth
but 510,000 at the time of the death
of Matteucci and has increased $1000
in value since then.
"I find," said Judge Kerrigan in ap
pointing Tyler referee, "that the ad
ministrator has, according to his ac
count, paid out $1000 for family al
lowance, when no allowance was or
dered by the court; that he has al
lowed $500 attorney's fees, a sum en
tirely disproportionate to the value
of the estate; that he contends he has
paid out nioneys on assessments on
stocks when the inventory shows the
estate owns no stocks, and that he al
lowed $1187 50 burial expenses and
has no receipts to show that such a
sum was paid. I wish the referee to
examine into these matters as soon as
possible and report without delay to
the court."
Vannuccl is represented by Attor
ney A. D. Solivalo.
Say They Were Deceived.
Sol Kahn and Fannie Williams filed
suit yesterday against John Breuner
and Lewis A. Gould to recover $1080
they allege they have paid as rent for
the Roycroft, 305 Turk street, over and
above what the defendants should have
charged them under the terms of an
agreement. Plaintiffs allege that de
fendants agreed to rent them the prem
ises at the same price paid by the de
fendants under the terms of a lease
held by them. The defendants, plain
tiffs say, claimed they paid $428 a
month under the lease, and believing
the statement to be true the plaintiffs
paid this sum for a period of seventeen
months and ten days, and then discov
ered the defendants only paid $360 a
month. Hence they ask for the return
of $60 a month for the period itemed.

For the First Time the Ger
man Government Predicts
Early Ending of War
NICHOLAS IS WAVERING
Even the Grand Dukes Are
i\ow in Fnvor of Making
Terms With- the Mikado
BERLIN, April s.â Peace at an early
date is regarded as probable by the
German embassy at St. Petersburg, and
in consequence of dispatches received
by the Government during the last
three days this opinion circulates In
official circles for the first time since
the war was begun. The Russian Em
peror, it is true, has not yet decided for
peace, but the Grand Dukes and all, or
practically all, of the members of the
court who have access to the Emperor
are for peace. The Emperor is de
scribed in the gossip that goes about
here as standing alone irresolutely. The
considerations that still delay his deci
sion are personal ones, he feeling that
his reign is a failure if Russia does not
win the war and that his prestige as a
sovereign will be lost at home and in
foreign countries, but he cannot yet
bring himself to speak the word that
will set the peace negotiations in mo
tion.
Much good will and sympathy are felt
for the Russian Emperor in higher of
ficial life here, but it is regarded as a
certainty that he must yield to his
! family and Ministers and that the
i month will not end without peace. In
i the meantime uncertltude of the Era
| peror weakens the military administra
tion and delays the execution of plans
for fresh armies and the gathering of
new supplies.
AUSTRIAN ATTACHE MISSING.
Count Schertzizky Has Not Been Seen
Since Mukden Was Taken.
GENERAL KUROKTS HEAD
QUARTERS, Tuesday, April 4. â The
Japanese army has been making a
fruitless search for information as to
the fate of Count Scheptzizky, a cap
tain in the Austrian army and the
military attache of that Government
with the Russian army in Manchuria.
Count Scheptzizky has been missing
since the battle at Mukden. He is
not among the prisoners or wounded
in Japanese hands. It is possible,
however, he may have escaped into
Chinese territory. If killed, he prob
ably was burled as a Russian, among
the dead of that army.
COMPLAIN OF CENSORSHIP.
Russian War Correspondents Ham-
l>ered by Officials.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 6. â Rus
sian newspaper correspondents in
Manchuria, having received papers
containing accounts of the battle of
Mukden, are wiring protests against
its consideration as an "overwhelm
ing disaster and unprecedented de
feat and destruction of the Manchu
rian army." The correspondents com
plain bitterly of the censorship which
forbade the transmission of true ac
counts of the battle from the Russian
side, permitting the papers and the
public to derive their impressions
from telegrams colored by the Jap
anese view.

to learn, that reported antl-foreigrn
movements in China are not unusual
in extent or character. The Russian
Government recently requested Sec
retary Hay to inquire into this mat
ter, which was a cause of some anx

AWAIT SIGNAL
FOR OUTBREAK
Revolutionists in Russia
Are Ready for a General
Rising Against the Czar
PRESS AIDS TERRORISTS
Adds Fuel to the Flame of
Popular Indignation by
Exposing Gross Corruption
ST. PETERSBURG, April s.â The
prospect of a general upheaval of the
city and country with the advent of
spring increases dally. Evidence ac
cumulates that the radical forces are
acting in unison and awaiting a sig
nal, which, it is generally believed, will
be given shortly after the Russian
Easter. The terrorists are showing
great activity and reports from all dis
tricts prove that the workmen, who,
in many cases have been formulating
petty demands, which are no sooner
granted than they are succeeded by
others, are acting under instructions
from the revolutionary leaders, who
are only biding their time.
The guard regiments, which usually
'go to camp in April, will be retained
in St. Petersburg, it is announced, until
June, ostensibly in order to allow the
camps to be cleaned in view of the
danger of cholera, which is regarded
as being so serious that the sanitary
authorities have ordered the immediate
cleaning of the streets, sewers, cess
[ pools and canals of the capital and
have issued specific instructions to
householders, especially in the poorer
districts, where the people live in eel
, lars.
What is now called the constitutional
press is adding fuel to the names by
entering upon a campaign for exposing
the corruption and venality In various
branches of the administration. Old
scandals relative to the transportation
of merchant freights, especially on the
Siberian railway, have been revived,
and from the documentary evidence the
most astounding state of affairs is
shown to exist. The military authorir
ties control transportation on the Si
berian railroad, the general staff is is
suing: permits for every car, and mer
chants desiring to ship goods to Irkutsk
or farther East are compelled to buy
such certificates. A regular traffic in
them has been exposed, permits bring
ing from $300 to $500, the authorities
then shipping the goods as munitions
of war, while the munitions are side
tracked.
A case is cited where it cost a mer
chant $1453 to get a single car to Ir
kutsk, and another where a car re
mained on a sidetrack from May to
January because the consignee declined
to pay any more money to the military
authorities.
PHYSICIANS DIP INTO POLITICS.
Anti-Cholera Convention In Russia
Indorses Radicalism.
MOSCOW, April 5. â The congres3
of doctors from all parts of Russia
which was summoned to meet in Mos
cow to devise means for combating
the expected visitation of cholera has
justified the apprehensions of the au
thorities by adopting as its first step
in the anti-cholera crusade a set of |
resolutions calling for the execution
of the whole of the radical political I
programme. This grafting of political
considerations upon the ostensible
aims of the gathering was justified. |
the speakers argued, by the incapacfty
of the present administration to cope
adequately with cholera. The con
gress also demanded the immediate
stoppage of the war.
This action of the congress was not
unexpected, as the medical profession
of Russia is largely composed of Jews
and Poles and has been subjected to
the radical influence of the universi
ties.
POLICE FORBID FUIVERAL.
Cossacks Use Their Swords in Dis-
persing a Warsaw Crowd.
WARSAW, April 6. â In anticipation
of the funeral of a girl who died of
wounds received in the fighting on
Sunday the workmen of all the fac
tories In the northern part of the city
left their work yesterday afternoon
and crowded the streets. The police,
fearing a hostile demonstration, for
bade the funeral and summoned Cos
sacks who, using their knouts and
swords freely, finally succeeded in dis
persing the gathering.
A non-striking workman at the gas
works, whom the strikers had con
demned to death, was shot and severe
ly wounded yesterday by a striker.
MOBS COERCE THE PRIESTS.
Force Clergymen to Proclaim Fealty
to Their Cause.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 6. â Of
ficial advices report continued dis
orders in the Caucasus. Within the
past week peasants have looted and
burned public offices in many villages
In the Gore district, sacked schools
and private estates, cutting down trees
and threatening to kill the police if
they interfered, and forced pr!Â«sts to
go with them and take an oath of
solidarity with their cause.
At Kishineft Wednesday night an
unsuccessful attempt was made to as

ALLEGES THAT PARTNER
IS SHORT IN ACCOUNTS
Thomas B. Coghill Claims George A.
Kahn Has Defrauded Him
Out of $30,000.
George A. Kahn was summoned by
Judge Sea well yesterday to appear next
Friday to show cause why he should
not be permanently enjoined from in
terfering with the business or tamper
ing with the assets of the firm of Cog
hill & Kahn. Coghill sued Kahn re
cently for an accounting of the busi
ness, -and now makes the allegation
that he has discovered that his partner
has defrauded him out of $30,000
through tampering with the books of
the firm.
Coghill says he has learned that
Kahn, who has been his partner for
seventeen years, compelled their book
keeper to make false entries for the
purpose of covering up his fraudulent
withdrawals of funds, and now threat
ens to take the residue of the assets
of the firm. A temporary restraining
order was issued against Kahn, and It
will be made permanent next Friday
unless he can show that the allegations
of the plaintiff are not based on facts.

NEW YORK, April 5. â Louise E.
Rivers of New Rochelle, 11 years of
age, has sacrificed her life in a success
ful effort to become the skippin< ropa
champion of her neighborhood.
To jump the rope 200 .times has long
been the championship record of the
district. The child had often tried In
vain to exceed it. When she began
jumping in her last attempt, Louise
looked as well as usual. As she ap
proached the 200 mark she fJH pale
and tired, but she doggedly kept on
jumping. At 218 the girl fell, scream
ing with pain and died shortly after
ward at the hospital. The doctors
found she had been attacked by acuta
appendicitis.

BT. LOUIS, April 5.â At the request
of his wife, Hurd Galbraith, lately of
San Francisco, was taken into custody
by the police and later removed to the
observation ward at the City Hospital.
He said while in California a year ago
he was Informed that his wife, from
whom he had separated, intended to re
marry in St. Louis. He returned and
attempted to effect a reconciliation.
Shortly after his arrival here he was
placed in an asylum from which hÂ«
was released ten days ago. He says
he is not insane, but is being perse

the way.OPERATIONS OF BIG BURGLARS' TRUST
BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN FRANCE.
MODERN ALI BABA DIRECTS GANG OF FORTY THIEVES
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, April s.â French criminal an
nals record no more astounding: reve
lations than those just made at the
trial of the members of the burglars'
trust at the Amiens Assize Court. The
story brought out by the testimony far
surpasses in interest the forecast of
disclosures expected when the prisoners
were (trst arraigned. Criminal â  syndi
cates have long been a favorite device
of sensational detective story writers,
but the operations of the modern AH
I?aba and his gang have again shown
that fact still outstrips fiction. 80 ex
traordinary has been the interest
aroused by the trials that the court- j
house has presented the appearance of
a building besieged with armed gend
armes keeping the mob at bay. .
The founder of this most successful j
association of thieves that ever existed \
is known by the police as Marius Jacob,. j
though hJs full name i Alexandre Ma
rius Jacob Escande. . He is keen-witted, ;
rÂ«"9ourcÂ«fui. .possessed of Â» unlimited j
cunning and audacity and a genius for '
organization. Such as he is, he can at ;
loast boast that he is a self-made man. :
He Â«rÂ«a born at Marseilles less .than
thirty years ago, and beginning life as 1
a cabin boy circumnavigated the globe.
Tiring of a seafaring life, he returned
home, was apprenticed to a printing of- â¢
fice and became a compositor. Next he '
became an anarchist and. turned his at
tention to the manufacture <>f bombs. '
Ho and that a risky business and an I
fltable one. He . concluded that â 
life would be much easier and pleasant
Â«?r for him if he devoted himself to rob
bing the rich instead of blowing them
up-
UNIQUE PROSPECTUS. â¢
He became a thief, and profited also
by the thefts of others by opening a
rurio shop, where he sold stolen an- ,
tiques and objects of art. With the aid
of a confederate he effected some rich \
hauls in Marseilles by passing himself
off as a police official who had to search
rooms. Owing to some bunglingby his
ally he was arrested. The evidence was I
clear against him. so he made the best
of a bad job by shamming lunacy so ]
successfully that' he was committed to
an asylum at Aix.
Therje . he thought out the scheme
which' fairly entitled him to be styled \
the Napoleon of crime. A shrewd Judge j
of human nature, he confided it to a
keeper, who agreed to join him in the
enterprise and _ helped him to escape. j
Together they came to Paris. In a '
couple of yearsâ that was in 1900â the â 
"ToilÂ«=rf of the Night. Limited," as' he '
facetiously : termed the organization, â 
was launched. This is its â  prospectus, !

GRUDGE AGAINST CHURCHES.
Like a leaf from some romance of
crime this reads, but it is â . the actual
constitution of this extraordinary
league of robbers, which is now broken
up. I'nder Jacob's astute leadership it
proved most effective in binding: them
together and insuring the success of
their operations. Members ' were se-,
lected with the utmost care. Most of
â¢them were specialists.
Pelissard, an -member of the Btaff
of an anarchist paper and a skilled
mechanic, made : the burglary tools
needed by the gang and they are of
superb workmanship. Santarel, . be
sides taking his turn as a' cracksman,
melted down the gold stolen by his
colleagues. Ferre. a good all-around ,
thief, was the concierge of a house in
Paris, and at his rooms the board of
directors held their meetings. Claren-
Bon played the role of swell. and was a
clever card sharper as well as an ac
complished burglar. ; . ;..,.
The fact that for years the existence
of the band was not even suspected by
the police shows with what consum
mate skill its operations were con
ducted. Everything wag . done in the.
most business-like fashion and no
needless risks were taken. The thieves '
worked all over France, from Abbe
ville and Amiens to 'distant Marseilles.
They robbed town mansions, country
houses, officers* quarters/ hospitals, and
even churches and cathedrals. ' At
! Rennes they pillaged the house of the
Justice of .- the Peace; at Mans they
appropriated jewels . and ; objects of art
to the value of $2000 from the residence
of the Judge of the As"size. Court; and
at Beziers. Narbonne, and : Rou
en , they, despoiled " the cathedrals ?of
their, sacred vessels and jeweled vest
ments. '...-'
Against houses -of " worship - they
seemed .to cherish \ t a special grudge !
and played the.part of vandals as well
as robbers; destroying what they'could
not â¢â â  carry off. . After * looting . the â¢ ca- s
thedral " at Tours - they cut up the five
world-famed pieces of tapestry depict
ing scriptural , scenes and valued at
5250.000. v . . â -*â.â 
~ ; - y ACCOUNTS IX A LEIKiEK. %
: Jacob kept a. ledger, in which every
operation or transaction of the ' band
and the profits accruing therefrom were
entered. From the headoffice In Paris
two traveling inspectors were sent out
to Investigate' and Teport on houses
named by local agents as offering good
opportunities for a safe job. They. were
paid a salary, of $100 a month each; all
thei! - expenses i and a share of the
profits obtained from the business done
as a result of their efforts. If any one

It was chance and not detective skill
; that ultimately led to. the discovery of
; the gang and ; the arrest â¢of Its prlnct

â  at Abbeville had . not,- . been f troubled

in the burglary had taken alarm and
fled along the country road to Amiens.
At a little country railway station
three of them took tickets for Calais.
GANG AT LAST BROKEN UP.
The police came up with them on
the platform and were going to arrest
them on suspicion when they opened
fire with revolvers, killing one police
man and severely wounding another.
LAn exciting man hunt followed, but
eventually two of the gang were ar
rested near Amiens. Jacob was one
!of them and some correspondence
i found in his pocket caused a watch to
be kept on a house in Paris. Here the
third man who had been implicated
in the murder, Bour, was arrested.
The bullet that killed the policeman '
fitted his pistol and it was therefore ;
presumed that he" had fired the fatal |
shot, but instead of letting him know
that they tracked him, the police told â â 
him that his two companions had in- i
formed against him. That he might J
escape with a lighter punishment |
himself he revealed the existence of {
the burglars' trust.
The police succeeded in arresting j
tv.enty-nine of Us members, and ulti- !
mately in unraveling the most !
astounding story of criminal operations
that has ever been told in a French
law court. There are 150 charges of j
burglary and theft against the pris
oners, the value of their plunder ap- ;
proximating $200,000. Therfe figures.
It must be understood, represent only '
the depredations that have been defi
nitely traced to the gang. In the years
that they have eluded detection the
full extent of their thieving probably i
amounts to close on 5500, 000.
Jacob is a conscienceless scoundrel, .
with all of the born criminal's inor- \
dinate vanity. He regards himself as 1
a hero.
"Gentlemen." he said in one of his â¢
numerous addresses to the jury, "you !
say that 1 have stolen, J>ut T say that
I have only retaken. I have only |
robbed the well-to-do fandlords, priests j
and military officers â all those who j
are indolent and live on their incomes. !
I am conscious of having promoted '
th? well being of humanity. I am not
in the least sorry for what I have done;
on the contrary I glory in it, because !
my actions are the consequence of the j
vices of our social institutions."
PRICE OF MAY
WHEAT JUMPS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. April 6.â May wheat took
a jump of nearly 4 cents a bushel on
the Board of Trade to-day. It sold to
%l 11% and much excitement accom
panied its wild flight to that figure.
The advance waÃ one of those freak
ish caprices of a manipulated market,
such as that which now exists as the
result of a determined effort on the
part of John W. Gates and a few other
Wall street speculators to shake a
few dollars out of the pockets of the
bears in the wheat pit. .
The market opened at 11 14 to $1 H%
and gave no signs of undue activity
until along about midday, when a sud
den cessation of offerings threw the
smaller shorts into a panic. In the
scramble to buy which followed, the
price was bid up 1 cent between trans
actions.

OIL REFINERY
FOR COLORADO
Independents Will Erect a
Plant Which They Will
Ask the State to Operate
TO FIGHT THE TRUST
City of Chicago Begins Suit
Against Standard for the
Non-Payment- of Its Fees
DENVER, April 6.â The failure of
the Legislature to pass the Wilder
State oil refinery bill will not, as was
expected, put a stop to all opposition to
the Standard Oil trust in the Florence
fields.
Before the bill was sent to the Senate,
after it had passed Its third reading in
the House, Representative Wilder an
nounced that the appropriation of $125,
000 which the bill carried would not
have to be put up by the Stateâ that
the independent oil men of the Florence
district had already subscribed the
amount, and that all they asked was
that the State nominally take charge
of the refinery.
Representatives Wilder and McGuire,
both of Fremont County, have been in
communication with their constituents,
and now announce that the oil pro
ducers have decided to begin work on
the new refinery at once.
CHICAGO. April s.â The city of Chi
cago to-day filed suit for $40,000 against
the Standard Oil Company. The bill is
based upon the alleged non-payment of
Inspection fees by the Standard Oil
Company. It is claimed that the com
pany has for years refused to pay for
inspections made by the city under an
ordinance regulating commerce in
naphtha and gasoline. Representatives
of the Standard Oil Company held that
gasoline and naphtha are not products
of petroleum and that the ordinance
does not apply.

NEW YORK. April s.â Howard Cros
by Warren, a professor in Princeton
University, and Catherine Campbell of
Indianapolis, Ind., were married at the
City Hall by Mayor McClellan to-day.
An Incident occurred in connection
with the marriage which led the Mayor
to publicly proclaim that he is pro
scribed by law from accepting fees for
a marriage ceremony. At the conclu
sion of the ceremony the best man
handed the Mayor an envelope contain
ing a fee.
"Don't do that," said the Mayor.
"Don't give it to anybody else either."
The best man was plainly disconcert
ed and the Mayor was asked why he
would not accept the fee. or why no
one else could have it.
"Because," he replied, "I don't want
to see any one go to State's prison. No
one can take any fee for work done
here."
PERSONAL INJURIES
NOT PREFERRED CLAIM
Montana Court Makes Killing aa to
Cases Against Street Railway
Companies.
HELENA. Mont.. April 5. â Holding
that the compiled statutes of Montana
referred solely to railroads of com
merce and not to street ratlwav com
panies, the Supreme Court has effec
tually disposed of the case of Lizzie
Hamilton against the Great Falls
Street Railway Company, a personal
injury case. Miss Hamilton recov
ered judgment of $20,000, but was
made party-defendant in a foreclosure
suit brought by the Daly Bank Com
pany against the street railway. She
contested this on the ground that the
statutes made personal injuries a pre
ferred claim over a mortgage. The
District Court, however, held it was
applicable only to steam railroads,
which has just been affirmed by the
Supreme Court.

NOVEL EXCUSE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, April 5. â The only excuse
that Louis Levique had to offer when
arrested here to-day by Officer Scully
for having stolen $210 from the cook at
the Dominican Monastery in Benicia
yesterday was that he had been robbed
of a considerable sum himself and
wanted to see what it felt like to be
on the taking end. Levique was em
ployed as a waiter at the big Catholic
institution up to yesterday, when he
announced his intention of departing
for hia old home in Canada. After he
left the cook at the monastery discov
ered that his trunk had been broken
open and his savings taken. The tfal
lejo police department received a mes
sage to look out for- Levique and cap-
Hired him just as he was boarding a
steamer bound for San Francisco. He
has been taken back to Benicia.

DENVER, April s.â The array of

as It is a useless appendage, I will not
appoint any one to serve."

to give the State a business adminis

BDeclsJ Dispatch to The Call.
BIG PINE. Wyo., April 6.âSnow
shoe messengers from Kendall have
broug-ht out news of what claims to be
the rtehwt goid discovery ever made in
this State. Eight prospectors from
Idaho have located a vein upon the
cropping of which $50,000 in. gold is ex
posed.
The find wm made last autumn, too
late for location work to be done a-fter
vinter had set in, and the prospectors
covered up the ledge and returned to
Idaho. A few days ago they snow
efeoed into Kendall, and their actions
aroused 6uch curiosity that the news
of tbe new discovery soon became
public.
There Is three feet of snow in the
mountains, but locators are going to
the find on snowshoes. It is predicted
that. when the snow leaves the ground,
as it will within a few weeks, a rec
ord-breaking rush to the new "dig
gings" will commence.

on Strike.
Special Dispateb to TbÂ« CsJL
CHICAGO, April s.â Whether a gen
eral strike of building trades shall be
called in practically every big build
tag under construction in Chicago, in
order to compel the United States Gov
ernment to obey certain trades union
rules, violations of which have al
ready tied up work on the new post
office building, is to be considered at a
meeting of the Associated Building
Trades to-morrow.
It is proposed to stop work on all
buildings where the Otis Elevator
Company has contracts to supply
"lifts," and to keep the work at a
standstill until the company, which
has a contract with the United States
Treasury Department for elevators in
the Chicago Federal building, is forced
to allow union steamfitters to Install
the piping that operates the air-pres

POLITICS AS
IT IS PLAYED AT
WOMEN'S CLUBS
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND. April 8. â The early April meet
ings of the women's ciMbs always teem with
Interest, for it Is then the annual elections
take place and lovely woman may enjoy the
priv!fcgÂ» that 1Â» denied her elsewhere â that of
vitlnp. The game of politics Is played with
rest, and if only tome member with convic
tions, and the courage to give them voice,
will Mir up a little excitement by protesting
against a certain proceÂ«ding as being lliegal,
or something of that sort, then the business
of the day gains in fascinating interest. It Is
so like the real thing that man instate upon
usurping, and really one cannot blame the
men; the ballot privilege is about the only
thing left by which poor male creatures may
be distinguished, and they are hanging on to
it with a tenacity that bodes ill for the euf
frasrists.
Feace brooded like a gentle spirit over
EbellÃ annual election yesterday. Mr*. J. B.
Hume succeeding herself as president. Mrs.
( ' . W. Klneey. who was vloe president last
year, and Mrs. '.Jeorge M. Shaw, who waa
;>'>nding secretary, not caring for the re
bilities of another term of office, were
the only members of the old board not re
elected.
The rrw board 19 now composed of the fol
lowing officers: Mrs. James B. Hume, presl-
Q*-nt; Mrs. Melvlr. C. Chapman and Mrs. S. J.
Taylor, vice presidents: Miss Eva Powell, re

and Mrs. John Bake-well, general curator. The
new membership committee Includes: Mrs.
Thomas Bennett Mrs. Arthur Brown, Mrs. W.
H . Chickering, ' Miss Marian Everson. Miss
Janet Haliht.
The Oakland Club elected its new board of
directors to-day, and the large vote east was
anipl* evidence of the interest felt by the
mÂ«TnbÂ«re in the club affairs. The election was
uneventful, save that the withdrawal at the
last moment of two namee rather (nixed things.
Tbe new board will be compoaad of Mrs.

Next Wednesday the board will announce
the officers whom they will aelect In tfit
meantime. Mrs. George W. Bunnell will no
long-er irr*t,l,ie over the destinies of the club
oi which she has so long been the head. She
r*ad her farewell address to the members to
day. Mrs. Bunnell is a woman of remarkable
executive ability, and it is doubtful If any
other could have taken the club, when it waiÂ»
threatened with dissolution a few yean ago
and brought it to its present nourishing con
dition.

MEASURE
ORBIT OF
NEW COMET
Astronomers of State Uni
versity Apply System to
Determine Its Movements
and Achieve Signal Victory
RESULT A TRIUMPH
OF MAN'S GENIUS
Professor Leuschner's New
and Unpublished Method
Is Utilized in Finding
Ont the Facts Desired
BERKELEY, April s.â The measure
ments of a comet, so faint that it is
difficult to observe, have been success
fully taken by Dr. Russell Tracy Craw
ford of the university's astronomical
department, and James D. Maddrill,
fellow in the Lick Observatory. An
nouncement of this feat was made by
the university authorities to-day.
The orbit of the comet fh question
was computed from an observation by
the discoverer of the heavenly body,
Giacobini of Nice, Italy, and "Two ob
servations secured on March 27 and
March 30 by Dr. Aitken at the Lick
Obseravtory. The original discovery
was made by Giacobini on March 26.
The results involved in the measure
ment of this newly discovered comet
were produced at the University of
California by a new and as yet unpub
lished method of Professor Leuschner,
which is an adaptation of his more gen
eral method to the direct computation
of a parabola.
The time during which the comet has
been under observation is too brief,
according, to the university scientists
to decide whether the orbit is periodic.
A parabola, however, say these astron
omers, satisfies the observations very
well.
Dr. Crawford and Mr. Maddrill find
that the comet passed its perihelion on
April 3, at a distance of some 104,000 -
000 miles from the sun. The nearest
distance of 66,000,000 miles to the earth
occurred on March 28. /
This new comet is now receding from
the sun and the earth, and by April 15
its brightness will have diminished to
seven one-hundredths of its original
brightness on March 26. The comet
is traveling northeast at the rate of
about one and five one-hundredths de
grees per day through the constellation
Gemini. The inclination of its orbit to
the eliptlc is forty-one degrees, the lon
gitude of its ascending node is 157 de
grees and the arc from the vernal
equinox to perihelion is 358 degrees.
From these data the positions of the
comet up to April 16 have been calcu
lated and the positions have been tele
graphed to other observatories. The
comet, whHe very faint and difficult to
observe, was seen with the six
inch equatorial by Dr. Crawford on the
evening of March 30.
DOLLARS BALM
FOR DECEPTION
OAKLAND, April 6.â Jilted by the
woman for whom he had labored for
months without pay, in expectation
that he was to be rewarded by the gift
of his immorata's heart and hand, G.
W-. Starkey was granted a judgment
against Mrs. E. A. Kneib of Fruitvale
in hard cash for what he had been un
able to collect in love and affection.
Judge Melvln weighed the evidence and
concluded that Starkey's loss would be
compensated for by $222 50, and he gave
a decision in his favor for thig amount.
According to the testimony, Starkey
said that he was a carpenter by oc
cupation and that he had met Mrs.
Kneib, who is a widow with a little
home of her own in Fruitvale. The
house, however, was somewhat dilapi
dated, and after winning his way into
the good graces of the lady a proposi
tion was agreed to between them to
the effect that Starkey should put in
what time he could fixing up the place,
and when it was thoroughly repaired
they would live together in the home
beautified by their combined efforts.
Starkey testified that he put in a
drain, sawed enough wood to last them
a year, shingled and painted and pot
tered about the place until it looked
like a new pin. Then he found he had
been played for a good thing. The
widow would not marry him and his
love's labor had been lost. He brought
an action in the Justices' Court and
was again defeated by his fair antag
onist, and he then took an appeal to
the Superior Court, and to-day was
granted a Judgment which the court
found to be commensurate with nis
loss.

THREE YOUNG ATHLETES
BARELY ESCAPE DEATH
Stanford Students
Take an Invol
.untary Dip.
Upset Canoe While
Out on Lagun
ita Lake
SpeclÂ»l Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. ApHl 5.
Three ot Stanford's most prominent
athletes found themselves in a dan
geroue predicament yesterday at Lit-
I tie Legunka Lake, Just back of the
I university. The men were "Sunny
Jim" Weller, fullback on the varsity
football team and star performer on
the cinder path; Jack Macfarland,
I winner of the low hurdles in the last
Intercollegiate track meet with the
University of California, and Joe Mil
ler, a crack freshman runner from
Bakersfield, who is counted on to win
three races in the coming meet.
The accident happened after the
track men had iinished training for the
day. a crowd of them went up on the
lake to sport after -the grilling work
on the cinder path. Waller, Macfarland
and Miller went out in a canvas canoe,
while- the others took a flat-bottomed
wooden boat. The Stanford lake, al
though artificial, is deep and full of
weeds, making It a hard place in which
to swim. The three athletes in the
canoe were near the center of the Uke,
when Weller playfully cuffe<J Miller be
hind the ear. MillÂ«r retaliated in kind,
and in a few minutes there waa a gen
eral "rough house," in which all three
participated. No canoe will stand still
under a playful fracas, and this one
proved no exception to the rule. In a
moment Stanford's three noted ath
letes were struggling In water that was
twenty feet deep. At flrst they consid
ered the matter a Joke, but when their
heavy clothes began to exhaust them
they realized the seriousness of their
predicament and cried for help. For
tunately the wooden boat with the
other athletes was not far off, and the
rescue was quickly made. The rescuing
party was made up of Reve Gartz
mann, hundred-yard sprinter: Roy
Edwards, a nuarter-miler, and Louis
Russell, a fast runner in the half-mile
event. The athletes were unharmed
from their sudden dip in the lake, and
no evil consequences followed, save a
severe lecture for their foolishness by
Trainer "DÂ«Â»d" Moulton.

A. CURTIN FROM TACOMA
Notorious Youns Crook Will Soon
Stand His Scc^ssd Trial on a
Charjre of Burglary.
Anthony Curtin, better known as
"Babe" Curtin, was brought from Ta

LYNCH KEEPS
THE OVERCOAT
OAKLAND, April s.â This is the tale
of a ooat.
George E. Lawrence, the Piedmont
capitalist and man about town, is the
owner of the coat, but Colonel Frank J.
Lym h. mine host of the Hotel Waldorf,
Fruitvale, holds possession of the gar
ment, which is described in the records
of Police Court Department 1 as a
light brown spring box topcoat.
There has been a contest over the
nobby bit of wearing apparel, which
until a few days ago adorn*d the fa
miliar figure of its genial owner. That
it yet remains in the control and keep
ing of Boniface Lynch is the nubbfn of
the story.
Several weeks ago Lawrence wound
up a domestic disturbance, in which his
wife was attacked by her spouse with a
knife. It was charged, by landing in the
City Prison. Lawrence, top coat and
all, remained there several days, until
his fever had subsided. ' After his re
lease he Journeyed to Fruitvale in
search of quiet, fresh air and recruiting
diet. He found all he required at
Lynch' s hostelry. But Lynch declares
his guest departed without arranging
to settle a score of $15 60. The vigilant
landlord froze unto the clubman's over
coat in lieu of coin.
Lawrence departed, but sought the
police, swearing out a search warrant
to recover his missing garment. Thi3
morning Lynch appeared before Police
Judge Mortimer Smith with the coat.
Lawrence failed to show, so the coat
was given back to Lynch pending fur
ther developments.

Special DiÂ«rÂ«tch to The Call.
PORTLAND, April 5.â "1 want to get
a notice of my death inserted in the
Oregonian," was the surprising state
ment of Dr. Neil O'Leary this morning.
The clerk glanced up in amazement.
Then the assertion struck him as a bit
of humor, at which he was expected to
laugh. So he laughed.
"You don't look much like a dead
man," he remarked.
"No, perhaps not." was the reply,
"but your paper will not be published
until to-morrow morning, and I shall
be dead by 6 o'clock this evening."
Then it was that the clerk became In
terested. He saw that O'Leary was in
earnest, entered Into conversation with
him and learned that the Intention of
the physician was to commit suicide.
The police were notified and Detectives
Snow and Kerrigan were sent to take
O'Leary into custody.'
When the detectives reached the
newspaper office Dr. O'Leary had gone.
Having his description, it was only a
short time until they succeeded in find
ing him upon the street. He was taken
to police headquarters and later to his
home.
Dr. O'Leary had been indulging in
intoxicants freely of late. A few morn
ings ago he walked into a drug store
after the saloons had closed and wrote
out on one of his own blanks a pre
scription for a drink of whisky.

PETALUMA JAPANESE
CELEBRATE GALA DAY
Hold Banquet in Commemoration of
Anniversary of Death of Their
First Emperor.
PETALUMA, April 5. â April 8
marked an important date in Japan
ese history, for its was on that day,
660 B. C, when their first Emperor,
Jimmu Tenno, died. The day is held
sacred by the pleasure-loving Japan
ese, who are loth to give up a fete
day, whether it has a historical foun
dation or not.
Six Japanese got together Monday
evening on a chicken farm near Peta
luma and celebrated the event in fit
ting style. One of them was Mr.
Okano, formerly of the law school in
Tokio; another was a former student
of the Higher Commercial College of
Tokio; Mr. Yano represented the
Higher Normal School, and the other
revelers represented as graduates the
Nobles' School, the Waseda Univer
sity and the Nihon High School.
Of the group Tomioka, the host at
the banquet, is the most illustrious as
to birth, for he is the son of General
Tomioka, commander of the Eighth
Division of the army in Manchuria.
At the outbreak of the war General
(then colonel) Tomioka was sent to
the front, as his prowess in previous
campaigns â in the Japan-China war
of ten years ago â had recommended
him for an important assignment.
The son, who owns a chicken ranch
near Petaluma, was graduated from
the Nobles' College, the most exclu
sive school in all Japan. The son of
the Emperor was graduated from the
school several years ago, and the Jap
anese declare with pride that, their
future Mikado will be a product of
the public school system.
The students of Waseda University,
represented by one of Monday night's
banqueters, are now sending a base
ball nine to California to play Stan
ford University. A professor will be
In charge of the squad. Baseball is
universally played in the schools of
Japan. Tennis and basket ball are
also among their favorite sports.
In case they defeat Stanford the
Japanese nine will challenge the Uni
versity of California to a game. The
Stanford challenge emanated from
Waseda.
LE ROY LEE ON TRIAL
FOR COUNTERFEITING
Stoutly Denies That He Passed a Bad
Ten-Dollar Bill Upon Mrs.
A. J. Vallade.
Le Roy Dee was placed on trial be
fore a jury yesterday in the United
States District Court on a charge of
having: passed a raised Ignited States
bill upon Mrs. A. J. Vallade, the own
er of a delicatessen shop on Sixth
street. The bill was a genuine SI sil
ver certificate, which had been al
tered to a note of $10 denomination
by pasting figures from a Confederate
note. He was positively identified by
Mrs. Vallade and her 'clerks. Several
witnesses swore that Lee was a rep
utable druggist, who sold out his busi
ness in the northern part of the State
and who was looking for a location to
reopen business in this city. It was
shown that on a former occasion he
had given a genuine $5 bill to Mrs.
Vallade for some small purchases he
had made. Lee stoutly denied that
he had given" a $10 bill to Mrs. Val
lade at any time. The case will be ar
gued this morning. The prosecution
Is being conducted by Assistant Unit
ed States District Attorney Charles
M. Fickert. and the defense by Bert
Schlesinger and Samuel Wright.
Juror W. R. Larzalere arose in the
box and stated to Judge de Haven
that he had a prior engagement for
to-day elsewhere than in court and
wanted to know about it. Judge de
Haven replied, "You will appear
here at 11 a. m.," thus establishing a
precedent that prior engagements
with man or woman do not excuse a
juror from doing his "duty-ooty-ooty
like a man."

Royce must serve a term in the Walla

refused to allow the Introduction of
Miss McFarlane's letters to Royce, this

ons, and his old license is good till
April 25. The new license law went into
effect April 1 and Smith refused to sur
render his $5 license to Marshal Thom

Was Unfounded.
Gustave Ahlsted, whose wife, Martha
A., had him arrested on a charge that
he placed strychnine in her coffee,
proved to the satisfaction of Judge
Troutt that the charge was trumped up
for the sole purpose of injuring Ahlsted,
so he gave the unhappy husband a di
vorce yesterday on the ground of ex
treme cruelty. Mrs. Ahlsted was al
lowed to keep possession of the lodging
house on Stevenson street that was the
scene of their quarrels, Ahlsted saying
he would waive any claim to the same
if the court would only free him from
the bonds he had found so irksome.
The court granted his prayer.
Judge Hebbard has cited James Rog
ers to appear next Friday and show
cause why he should not pay his wife,
Augusta M. Rogers, $40 Â§, month ali
mony. Rogers was also enjoined from
visiting their former home, at 1608 Pa
cific avenue, and attempting to remove
the furniture.
Suits for divorce were filed yesterday
by George D. Collins, a merchant,
against Katherine G. Collins for habit
ual intemperance and desertion, Mar
tha Edelstain against Harry Edelstain
for desertion, Lottie Smith against
Thomas Smith for desertion, Dana
Shaver against Ivan Shaver for neglect
and desertion and JohnLembke against
Angle Lembke for desertion.
SUES STONECUTTERS'
UNION FOR BIG DAMAGES
J. C. Boyer^ filed suit yesterday
against the 9an Francisco and vicinity
branch of the Journeymen Stonecut
ters of America to recover $5910 dam
ages he alleges he has sustained
through the conspiring of the officers
of the defendant union against him.
Boyer complains that the union in
duced his discharge from the employ of
the McGilvray Stone Company without
cause or provocation. He says that
some time ago the McGilvray Stone
Company secured a new stone-planing
machine and he entered into the em
ploy of the company as the operator
thereof, he being the only man on the
coast qualified to operate the machine.
He says the union made no objection
to him for a long time, permitting him
to instruct several stonecutters in the
use of the machine, with the result that
the company purchased a number of
the planers.
Finally, however, he says, the union
members conspired against him and
demanded his discharge. He sought ad
mission to the union, but was denied
the right, and finally the stone com
pany by which he was employed was
forced to yield to the demands of the
union and give his position to one of its
members.

SOUTH TO HAVE
A NEW OUTLET
E. H. Harriman Plans Direct
Line From Mojave to Town
of Hazen in Nevada State
WILL UUERY THE WORK
Eoute Will Include System
of Carson ruid Colorado
From Keeler to Churchill
The Southern Pacific Company is
soon to have another outlet to the East
from Los Angeles. Work upon the
project is already under way, and with
in a year it is expected that the new
route, which will connect the Southern
part of California with the Central Pa
cific in Nevada, will be in operation.
Yesterday the law department of the
Southern Pacific Company filed with
the County Clerk articles of incorpora
tion of the Nevada and California Rail
way Company, which is capitalized for
$15,000,000. Of this amount $457,000 is
subscribed, William F. Herrln, chief
counsel of the Southern Pacific, being
credited with $227,000, Assistant Chief
Counsel P. F. Dunne with $1000, Chief
Engineer William Hood with $227,000,
Treasurer N. T. Smith with $1000 and
Joseph L. Willcutt^with a similar sum.
The articles of incorporation set
forth that the new company proposes
building a road from Hazen, Churchill
County, Nevada, southward to "a point
on the Mojave Desert" and a branch
line of twenty-seven miles from
Churchill, a station on the Carson and
Colorado road, to Mound House sta
tion, situated on the Virginia and
Truckee Railroad. The outline of the
purposes of the new company as given
in its articles of incorporation are rath
er indefinite in that they convey the
idea that the promoters of the road
have a gigantic construction scheme
before them, whereas it is Harriman's
intention to effect connections between
Los Angeles and Hazen with the aid of
the Carson and Colorado road, thus ne
cessitating the laying of a trifle over
200 miles of^track.
Briefly, the Harriman plan is as fol
lows: The proposed cutoff between
Hazen, on the Central Pacific line, and
Churchill, on the Carson and Colorado
road, work upon which is already under
way, will be completed under the di
rection of the Nevada and California
road, and while this work is in progress
the company will start the construction
of an extension of the Carson and Colo
rado road from its present southern
terminus at Keeler. The course of this
extension will be in a southwesterly
directior* for a distance of about 120
miles, eventually connecting with the
main line of the Southern Pacific at
Mojave.
WORK TO BEGIN SOON.
It was said by the railroad officers
last night that the construction will be
gin at once and be hurried through as
fast as the material can be sent to the
front. While the building is proceed
ing a large force win be engaged to
broaden the entire system of the Car
son and Colorado line to a standard
gauge, so that the new route will be
ready to handle freight at the earliest
possible time. The main object of
connecting the Carson and Colo
rado with the Central Pacific on the
north and the Southern Pacific at Mo
jave is said to be the overcoming of
the excessive grades at Hazen, the re
lieving of much of the freight traffic
congestion on the coast lines between
here and Los Angeles and to also af
ford the southern part of California a
quicker service for freight destined
for points in the Middle West and the
East, not convenient to the Sunset
route.
With the completion of the Hazen
cut-off, which means a saving of about
sixty miles of running, the Virginia and
Truckee road, which is owned by D. O.
Mills and his associates, although oper
ated practically under the direction of
the Harriman officials, will cease to be
an important factor in railroad traffic
business over the Carson and Colorado,
which will then be a feeder to the Mills
road instead of the latter being the me
dium for transferring freight from the
Central Pacific to the Carson and Colo
rado.
TO MOVE FREIGHT.
The proposed branch line of the Cali
fornia and Nevada from Churchill to
Mound House will be about twenty
seven miles long and will be construct
ed simply to facilitate the handling of
local freight.
It is expected that before the new
route between Hazen and Mojave has
been completed the Harriman syndicate
will have possesed itself of the Tono
pah Railroad, which is now being fed
by the Central Pacific over the Virginia
and Truckee and the Carson and Colo
rado lines, a system of transportation
that has provoked much dissatisfaction
owing to the fact that the Tonopah
road is inadequate for freight ship
ments destined for the new Nevada
mining camps. A several months'
blockade on the latter road, which is
owned by Â«. Philadelphia syndicate
headed by John Brock, was recently
raised by General Manager Calvin of
the Southern Pacific, and since then
the latter company has been piling up
freight at the terminus of the little
road, where another blockade is threat
ened. According to reliable reports now
in circulation Harriman has given
Brock to understand that he must sell
his line at a fair price to the Southern
Pacific or the latter will parallel it next
year. Brock's experience in managing
a railroad has not been a happy one,
and it is said that he is seriously con
sidering Harriman's proposition to sell.
STRONG INFLUENCE AT WORK
/ TO OPEN WASHINGTON PARK
Horsemen Admit That Condon Xeeds
This Track in HJs Battle
With Corrigan.
CHICAGO, April 5. â One of the first
moves of the Western Jockey Club
and the Washington Park racetrack
people will be to ascertain the atti
tude of the coming city administra
tion in regard to racing at Washing
ton Park track. It is admitted by
horsemen generally that the Condon
influence needs the backing of Wash
ington Park aa an example and a
sporting center to give horsemen loyal
to the jockey club an opportunity to
race their horses continuously in the
Middlp West.
Without the Washington Park meet
ing there would be Harlem alone to
make battle with Hawthorne. In
case "mysterious political influence"
calls for a splitting of dates, dates
would go to Hawthorne, Harlem and
Worth. This means Harlem would be
idle four out of every six weeks. To
avoid this and prevent such a long
layout for the jockey club forces
Washington Park will be opened if by
any possible means permission can be
obtained.
WILL. REPAIR TUNNEL ROAD.â Oakland.
April 5 â Theodore Gier reported to the Mer
chants' Exchange last night that the Super
visors of Coutra Costa County have agreed to
aid In repairing the Contra Costa aide of the
tunnel road. Gier advised that the Exchange
use a nart of the money left over from the
tunnel fund to help the work.

One Thousand Baby Denizens
of Water Are Born in the
Hatchery at the Pavilion
INDOOR BASEBALL GAME
Forest, Fish and Uame
Association Giving Show
That Pleases Many Visitors
More than 1000 little lives came into
the world at the miniature flsh hatch
ery at Mechanics' Pavilion yesterday
and last night. The new born are the
wards of the Pacific Coast Forest, Fish
and Game Association, which Is con
ducting a successful exhibition in the
interests of charity. At various times
during the day and evening scores of
little yellow eggs quivered and tiny
steelhead salmon wiggled into the
water.
To the layman the process by which
the little flsh are born is a novelty, aa
well as an education. The eggs were
received yesterday from the State
Hatchery at Boulder Creek. No sooner
had the protoplasmic yellow spheroids
received their place In the hatching
trough at the Pavilion than the young
flsh, which will furnish sport for an
glers in months to come, began to seek
the water. The birth process attracted
thousands of Interested spectators.
Last night was Oriental night. Forty
little slant-eyed Chinese sang Ameri
can songs and hymns. Jiu-jitsu, indoor
tennis and an excellent musical pro
gramme completed the offering.
To-night Is fraternal night and dele
gations from city lodges will view the
show. An indoor baseball game will be
played between the Occidental and St.
Ignatius College teams. To-morrow
night will be Wagner night. A special
music programme has been arranged
for admirers of the German composer.
Saturday, between the hours of 10 a.
m. and 1 p. m. the inmates of all the
orphan asylums and institutions that
care for homeless and destitute chil
dren will receive free admission to the
show. A great treat will be given the
little ones. Refreshments will be dis
tributed and a programme specially
designed to please the child minds will
be rendered.
A. Studer and H. B. Klinkner re
duced the German ring target score
last night, each making 100 points.
Poolroom Cases Submitted.
Judge Seawell has taken under ad
visement the cases of cigar merchants
and keepers of poolrooms to restrain
the police from "blockading" the prem
ises occupied by them. The argument
was concluded Tuesday afternoon, but
some time was taken up yesterday
morning offering proof of ordinances.
This work concluded. Judge Seawell an
nounced that he would take the cases
under advisement and hand down an
opinion at the earliest possible day.
DEADLY IN EARNEST

Immense Wholesale Stock of
Finest Pianos Sacrificed
to Betail Buyers.
We realize that at regular retail
prices It would be impossible to sell the
pianos quickly here, but with the extra
ordinary price concessions we are pre
pared to make there will be thousands of
buyers willing to spend the extra nickel
to get to our stor^>.
We have four floors crammed full of '>
the nicest, cleanest, newest, handsomest ;
and best pianos we have ever carried, i
We have the newest things in Colonial
and Mission styles in the Decker, Hallet ;

and big concert grands, in the Hazelton.
Lester and Kimball makes. We have up

This Is the Newest.
"We have the Auto-piano, the newest
thing in musical instruments â the piano
which everybody can play, and play well.
It is either a self-playing piano or a
piano of the regular sort, as you like. As
a self-playing piano, using the regular
Pianola music, an inexperienced person
can play the masterpieces of the world
at his will. As a regular piano, the most
exacting musician will find it an instru
ment of the highest class. We have
never heretofore advertised the Auto
piano, and yet we are selling them at the
rate of more than a carload a month
One invariably sells another. The price
is $600, and at that figure many people
are giving up their old pianos and buy
ing Auto-pianos.
This brings up the subject of used
pianos: of pianos taken in exchange for
Auto-pianos; or for Decker, Hazelton or
Kimball pianos.
Every Make in Used Pianos.
Our stock of used pianos is large and
varied. If you want any particular make
of piano, it is a safe guess that we can
supply it to you. Our stock is always
changing, but we can at any time fur
nish good, practically new pianos of al
most all prominent makes at astonish
ingly low prices. To-day we have on

Chickering Baby Grand, in fine condi
tion $465; Steinway upright $245; nice
Decker, good as new. $231; two Emerson
uprights at $165 and $138; beautiful

Co. upright $55: Pianola, slightly used
$135; Ludwig. oak case. $166; and many
others.
At $65, $46. $37. $26. etc.. we are clos
ing out a number of choice square pianos,
among them such well-known makes as
Kimball. Steinway, Hallet & DaviÃ.
Weber, Zech. etc., etc. Pay $1 a week and

and new and up-to-date, coupled with
these wonderfully low "unloading sale"
prices, is securing this result.
We Guarantee Everything.
Whatever we sell must be found ex
actly what we represent it to be. All our
pianos sold are warranted both as to
quality and price. We sell you what you
want at a lower figure thftn you can pos

BAD GOVERNMENT HABIT.
MUCH space has been given in the magazines to a discussion
the habit rnment in American cities. It is con
ed by all pub'iasis who have written upon the subject
ihat the habit of evil govenÂ»ent may be so fastened upon a city
that it cannot Ik- shaken off, and comes to bo a matter of course.
New York City occasionally revolts. The Van YYyck administration
was a carnival of criminal excesses in government. Graft covered
the city like a cloud. Nice and crime were given immunity for a
Btderation, and in order that the profits might be larger the gov
ernment promoted the festering transgressions that paid a rake-on 1 '
for their existence.
The Seth Low administration followed as a reaction, and though
it did litHe more than stop the grafting and failed to reform in four
years the practice* of decades, yet it set such an example of decency
in the high places of the city government that even Tammany found
it necessary to put on respectability, and the administration of Mayor
'an is much cleaner and better than Van Wyck's. because
. break in the habit of bad government, and the city has
not lapsed to its former depths. P.y way of contrast it is conceded
by all writers tint 1 'hilrmelphia is so confirmed in the habit of bad .
eminent that its conditions are incurable. In that city there j
has been for years a partnership of the push, and good citizens have j
given up trying to reform the government. The habit of bad ad- !
ministration is confirmed and decent people content themselves with
making the best terms ;>ossible with the grafters, considering them- j
es held for ransom by the boodlers and paying the price.
The experience of Philadelphia discloses the danger of waiting
teceacy a?serts its interest in good government. San
Francisco may well be warned by that experience. When graft and !
corruption arc once entrenched in power and enriched by the profits
of crime their hold is seldom broken. The habit of bad government
in a city, like bad habits in an individual, may not be easily broken.
Under the present municipal administration in San Francisco !
thinps are done that would not have been tolerated even ten years
ago. Citizens see the evidences of evil and corruption in the govern
ment, but feeling their helplessness are content with being thankful
that it is no worsY. We desire to warn them that it is a short step â 
from bad to worse. Unless a disposition is shown, immediately, to;
remedy the vile ways into which the government has fallen, the
has not seen its worst days. What we know is what has hap
pened in the green stick ; what will it be in the dry?'
San Franc- - wing in material greatness. It is yearly be- ;
coming a richer spoil for the push and the grafters. The people go
on with enterprise and patience creating a necessity for better gov
ernment and getting worse instead. The greater our growth tin
greater our need for men at the head of the city government who
will administer it decently and uprightly : who will not keep in Pe
<â  office creatures who have taken the first lock step tow&rd
the penitentiary, and who are drawing salaries from the taxpayers,
with which to fight the paymasters. The citizen who two years ago
would have predicted the noisome condition of the city government j
which is now known to exist would have been accused of having .
bad dreams.
The shameful condition of the city government can be corrccud
â¢re it becomes a confirmed habit. If it is not the citizens who
had the power to effect reform and did not use -it will livfc to be
laughed at by future official generations of boodlers. When the
public health and morals, the ballot-box, the public safety and the
integrity of judicial proceedings all betray the slimy touch of cor
ion. h is time for the people to wake up. It is not pleasant for
ewspaper to have to sound the warning, but when great public j
departments are administered as the personal perquisite of vicious
â¢ . when the law is obstructed and the ballot-box is corrupted by
fraud and juries are confused by willful perjury, resistance must be
organised and made effective. The committee of 250 is the nucleus.
Let it be strengthened and supported.
LIBERALITY TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
CHILDREN'S interests are chief among those in which the pub
lic should be liberal. In the outlay of all necessary funds to
provide for that part of their welfare which the common
wealth has taken in trust there should be no parsimony. The Board
of Education has just made its estimates for the expenditures of the
public schools in the ensuing fiscal year. It will now be for the
Finance Committee of the Board of Supervisors to conform to what
vyill surely be the public desire in the matter, namely, to practice a
straitened economy in almost any other line rather than make a
parsimonious cut down in the estimates for the schools.
The amount provided by the State for our school purposes is
much less than it was last year, and this, joined with the great need
of new buildings, repairs because of the unsanitary conditions of
old ones, and the deficiency in the number of teachers needed to
keep classes from being too large to be effectively educated by rea
sonable attention to the personality of each child, demands a special
liberality for the ensuing year. Matters of detail as to divisions of
the appropriation may be subject to differences of opinion, but in the
main thing, a substantial provision for the educational needs of the
pupils, the public will stand for no cut unless it be plainly shown that
the economizing was absolutely necessary.
Among the items for minor sums recommended by the Board
of Education the one for portable school buildings has good show of
reason. We are getting less for our schools than we should from
the State, and the deficiency is largely due to the fact that the average
attendance at school is far too low. Only 36 per cent of our children
of school age attend the public schools, and in some counties the per
centage is double that. Lack of proper accommodations may partly
account for this small percentage. The portable schools would help
remedy this, and would entitle usMo more funds from the State.
Let there be no hesitation by the Supervisors in meeting the
enhanced school needs of the coming year. We have a corps of
teachers to be proud of. They deserve encouragement. One of the
most prominent educators of our time. President Harper of the
University of Chicago, has reminded us that of all the words work
the far most important is the work we do for children.

and an old gentleman had raised an
upper window, and, with a thundered
"Get out of this," had flung him a
I dime. But eleven cents from such a
J promising alley! PasojHale called on
j the saints to witness his ill treatment,
and moved farther up the alley.
No better success attended him here.
He whistled; he danced; he sang. He
smiled his best and bowed his lowest.
j He tried the intermezzo and "Ma Fili

He moved to the far end of the alley,
with view to quitting It. He made one
final stand, however, before the back
of an imposing house. With a sinking
heart he sent up the jerky bars of a
march from a popular light opera. The
house, like all the others, was unre
sponsive. Then he shifted to raf-tlme.
He decided to play through his reper

go back to the asphalt pavements and
try his luck somewhere downtown, be

two young people, and a single glance
showed that they were not happy.

Mrs. Robert P. Lister, who was

invitations bore the unusual legend,
"Presents respectfully declined," says
the New York World.
The bride divorced Robert Lister, a
millionaire, and recently received a
settlement foe her alimony claims.
Mrs. Colell's unwillingness to receive
presents was prompted by her idea
that these gifts are unnecessary.
"It is a farce for acquaintances to
give presents to a bride, and I have
always thought so," she said. "It may
be a bit unusual to express thes? opin
ions on invitations, but I have the

LYNCH-BLOSSE HELP
I Will Only Pay Bills
Incurred by the
Major's Wife.
OFFICER WORRIES
Creditors in South
land Clamor for
Their Money.
The troubles of Major Lynch-Blosse
are multiplying. The news that the
mother of his sick bride is speeding
westward to the aid of her disheart
ened daughter aroused inquiry among
the British officer's creditors yesterday
as to whether she would help him iiqui
date his obligations, but their hopes in
this direction were dampened by the
announcement that Mrs. Charles G.
Germain has refused to pay any bills
other than those incurred by her
daughter, which means that the major
may hope for little relief from his
mother-in-law, for his indebtedness is
mainly the result of reckless living.
It was reported yesterday that Major
L\nih-Blosse had incurred debts while
visiting a southern resort and that the
management of the Sea Beach Hotel is
included among his creditors and is
anxiously seeking a settlement.
Strangely, few of the British local resi
dents appear to be deeply concerned in
the major's unfortunate predicament,
and some of them have openly ques
tioned the truth of the statement that
he was on his way to the Orient on
military business when lack of funds
caused him to defer his embarkation on
the ocean liner. In fact, at the British
consulate it was stated that no one
there knew anything about Lynch-
Blosse. Although th^ surname appears
in the British army register, the initials
are not the same, and there appears
some doubt among the local representa
tives of Great Britain as to whether
the Lynch-Blosse now here and the one
mentioned in the register are the same.
That the major is deeply worried
his troubles he does not attempt
nceal. He has been striving to
negotiate a loan from local money
lenders, who are, however, fighting shy
of his propositions, and especialy since
it has become known that his mother
in-law is not disposed to help him. Yes
terday it was announced by one of his
creditors that he will have the major
trrested if he attempts to leave town

MISS ANGLIN
AT HOME IN
"FROU-FROU"
Miss Ansrlin in "Frou-Frou." The an
nouncement was enough to pack the
California Theater yesterday after
n".>n with her Sdmirers. Among them
came many or" the profession who had
an ofl day, and the clever actress was
greeted with rousing applause
throughout the afternoon.
The version played, which is taken
directly from the French. is well
adapted tor Miss Anglin. and by the
addition of the scenes left out of the
English adaptation gives more prom
inence to the leading character of the
play. â¢Frou-Frou" is the second of
the special weekly matiness that will
be given by Mi.Â«s Anglin's company
during her stay at the California.
The second act of the play was mar
red yesterd.iv by a panicky feeling that
pervaded the Audience over a false
alarm o*, fire. Allss Anglin bravelly
continued the scene, and, after urging
the audience to be calm, triumphantly
continued amid applause. Later Frank
Worthing was Interrupted, but he
calmly vent on with his work and the
alarm passed away.
Of Miss Anglin it is hardly necessary
to speak. She brings to the character
of Frou-Frou charm, vivacity, in
tensity and earnestness, and from be
ginning to end is Frou-Frou in all her
moods. The only regret is that the bill
is not to be repeated during the en
gagement.
Among the women of the company,
Miss Kdlth Cartwright was exception
ally good as the much injured and
much forgiving sister. Louise. Miss
< "art wrights work is a brilliant secc
ond to the stars acting.
Of the men, Frank Worthing appear
ed rather ill at ease in his part. His
best scene is the parting from his wife.
Given an equally attractive part, Wal
ter Allen's work would entitle him to
equal honors. His impersonation of
the father, Bripard, is artistic and in
no way overdrawn. Edward Emery
as Count Paul seemed to realize he was
playing the villain, and acted accord
ingly. Master Harold Eggers, a bright
youn.cster, rarr.hles through the last
three acts nnd helps to smooth out the
plot at the finish.
STREET RESIDENTS
TO PRESENT AN ULTIMATUM
Club Directors Will Make Final De-
ii mi nl To-day for Underground
Trolley System.
To-day noon the directors of the
Slitter Street Improvement Club,
headed by Â£>r. Julius Rosenstirn, will
call upon the United Railroad officials
at the Rialto building and endeavor to
come to an amicable understanding
with the company regarding the
urgent need for the betterment of the
Sutter street car system by the in
stallation of an underground electrical
system.
The directors will appear armed
with fact#tending to convince the rail
road men thjft it is the best possible
thing for them to do, and that if they
refuse, it will be a case of fighting
to a finish. ( Already 31,000 feet of
property out of 51,000 is represented
in the club that is fighting for the
securing of the conduit system.
In New York and Washington it has
been shown that though the conduits
have filled with water, the system has
not been impaired nor the service stop
ped. The club members also say that
it will save the road f cents a running
mile or something like $68,000 a year.
Xpw Home for Scottish Rite.
The Albert Pike Memorial Associa
tion filed notification in the office of

SOCIETY FOLK
PHILANTHROPIC
WeJl Known San Francis
cans Incorporate St. Igna
tius Training Association
WILL AID YOUNG PEOPLE
Homes and Schools to Be Es
tablished That Good Pur
poses May Be Fulfilled
Eleven San Franciscans who are well
known in society have determined that
there is yet room in this city for philan
thropic work, and as a result the St.
Ignatius Training Association was in
corporated yesterday. The trustees of
the organization are James D. Phelan,
R. E. Queen, Thomas B. Bishop, Eld-
ward McLaughlin, Frank J. Sullivan,
Emily Hager Dean, Clara L. Folger,
Mary L. Phelan, Eleanor Martin, Ellen
Hyde and Alice Phelan Sullivan.
In the articles of incorporation it is
said that the organization is not effect
ed for purposes of gain, but that the
object in view is purely philanthropic.
It is the purpose of the incorporation to
take up the training of young people,
without regard to race or creed, and fit
those that have been neglected by
parents or guardians and that have
drifted from proper ways for higher
aims in life.
Though there are many organizations
in San Francisco whoÃe aim Is to train
young people, there is yet room for
much work in this direction. It is said
the organization will begin active work
at once and in time establish homes
and schools for the housing and educa
tion of the youngsters that may fall to
its keeping.
TOXOPAH HOME COMPANY
TAKING OVER PROPERTIES
Growing to Great Proportions and
New York Contracts on the
Watf Here.
A representative of The Call saw
Mr. Arkell yesterday in his office of
Arkell, Hicks & Co. and ascertained
that the report is true about Tonopah
Home going: into a holding company.
Mr. Arkell saii: "We are organizing
a company known as the Tonopah
Horn* Consolidated Mines and Ex
ploration Company, with a capital of
five millions. We will take over with
in the next three weeks all the prop
erty of the Tonopah Home and several
other companies. At the present time
I am not at liberty to state, because I
am only acting as an agent for the
company. I will say our contracts
are all made and the papers on the
way from New York all signed up.
but it would not be right for me to
give the information until I see the
papers properly filed. When I first
came to Tonopah and bought the
Tonopah Home I predicted the com
pany would be one of the largest in
Nevada. It has grown from a child
to a full grown man. I said this in
all my advertisements, but few here
believed me then, and as usual the
Ww Yorker walked away with the
stock. I am to live in Nevada and
California the next two years and I
believe this company which our house
represents v will grow and be one of
the largest mining and exploration
companies in the world and Califor
nia will deal JÂ« this stock to a greater
extent than even those of the old
Comstock days.
"I shall continue to advertise in the
California papers. notwithstanding
the natives tell me Calif ornians are
not interested in mines. I believe hu
man nature Is alike the world over.
We all like to . see a fine horse, ad
mire a beautiful woman, lovers of
art. and no man can succeed if he has
goods to sell unless he advertises.
Don't spend more money than you
earn; If you are fat, don't eat more
than two meals a day; hustle while
you wait. These are my mottoes for
success."

H. Flynn, J. P. Hare, Owen O'Reilly,
J. P. Cosgrove, Martin Lacey, T. J.
Connolly, John P. Allen. As a pre

FAIR GOLFER WHO CAPTURED
THE SILVER MEDAL YESTER
DAY ON THE PRESIDIO LINKS.
INDOOR TENNIS
IS A SUCCESS
Probably never before has tennis been
played amid such surroundings as it
was last night at Mechanics' Pavilion.
Indians at one end, Chinese children
singing hymns at the other and trees
and animals on all sides made up the
setting. The games were the first of a
series to be played in connection with
the Forest, Fish and Game show, and
proved both interesting and exciting.
The light was rather strong and made
it difficult for the players to see the
balls. The game was much faster than
on the asphalt. In fact, the balls took
such a fast bound that the players had
considerable difficulty in playing off
them. An uncertain footing was also
added to their troubles.
After the players had become accus
tomed tc the surroundings some fast
tennis was played. The opening match
was a doubles between Herbert Schmidt
and Harry Rolfe and George Janes and
Herbert Long, all of the California
Club. Schmidt and Rolfe played a re
markably good game and beat their op
ponents easily. Schmidt was the star
of the four, and although he has had
no practice he played even better than
on the asphalt. The score was 6-3, 6-1.
The second match played was a sin
gles between Janes and Clarence Grif
fin of the Golden Gate Club. The con
testants were evenly matched and an
exceptionally good game resulted.
Griffin won the first set by a score of
7-5. Janes took the second, 6-3. The
third and deciding set was a hard
fought affair, which necessitated the
playing of twenty games. Janes, who
was constantly ahead after the tenth
game, finally won the set, 11-9. The
score, in his favor, was 5-7, 6-3, 11-9.
On Saturday afternoon Harry Rolfe
and Carl Gardner will meet in singles
In doubles J. R. Lewis and E. P. Finni
gan will be opposed to Charles Dunlap
and Charles Foley.
LICK TEAM PROTESTS
GAME WITH LOWELL KIKE
Claim Is Made by the Potrero Players
That the Umpire Exceeded
Hia Authority.
The manager of the Lick School
baseball team filed a protest with the
Academic Athletic League baseball
committee yesterday against award
ing last Saturday's game to the Low
ell team.
The full nine innings had not been
played when the game was called, as
the Recreation Park grounds had to
be surrendered at noon. Umpire
Claybrough awarded the game to
Lowell by a score of 7 to 4. â¢"Heine"
Heitmuller, who was also acting as
umpire, claimed his colleague over
stepped his authority. Seven innings
of the game had been played.

BOOKS ARE HURT
ON FOUR EVENTS
Piablic Choices Famish ie Front
F. W. Barr Defeats Father Catchemâ Gold
Enamel Quite an Acrobat.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
The crack three-year-old, Dr. Leggo,
jumped over the moon, stopped at Mars
to collect the mail and then left his
j field behind him in the mile and three
sixteenths handicap at Oakland yes
terday a jumbled-up, homogeneous
mixture of boys, saddles, whips and
selling platers.
In annexing the long end of the $1000
purse, the Doctor lowered the Coast
record for the distance from 2:00% to
1:59^. There looked a chance that
Hans Wagner might repeat his victory
of last Saturday, but that horse flat
tened out like a flannel cake, after
cutting out the pace for nearly a mile.
Tooman had Dr. Leggo up in his lap
to the stretch, and then he touched
off the fireworks. It was just a cake
walk for the three-year-old, with his
108 pounds, as he passed the wire two
lengths in front of Elie, a 15 to 1
chance. Hans Wagner tired so badly
that Bombardier disposed of him for
show honors.
FOUR FAVORITES REGISTER.
Favorites swept everything before
them for four races, then the win of
Invictus gave the layers some relief.
The betting ring was thronged with
speculators.
War Times, a 12 to 1 chance, gave
the 4 to 5 favorite Oeyrohe an interest
ing argument in the opening event,
over seven furlongs. The outsider led
from the start and only hard riding on
the part of Birkenruth landed the first
choice by less than a length. Golden
Ivy, a 15 to 1 chance, nosed Yellow
stone out of the show.
Dod Anderson, a piping hot one, im
ported from Ascot Park, opened up fa
vorite for the Futurity course run fol
lowing. Later on 5 to 1 could be had
' about the stranger, which finished
third. Toupee, the post favorite, scored
easily after Bell Reed had blazed a
trail for the bunch. Pickaway ran
third.
Much has been written about the
prowess of Father Catchem, and while j
the southern country youngster made
a creditable showing in the two-year
old scramble, F. W. Barr held him
safe. The latter colt had Dugan on
his back, and reigned a pronounced
favorite. Father Catchem showed the
way into the stretch, where the first
choice gradually outfooted him, finish
ing first by two lengths in :54 flat.
Sherwood dropped in third with Ebel
Thatcher.
JOCKEY WRIGHT'S BAD RIDE.
Wright received credit for tossing
away the mile and a half selling fix
ture on Expedient, the 17 to 10 favorite.

Wayne Is College Tennis Champion.
RERKELEY. April 5. â Claude
Wayne established his right to the
title of tennis champion of the Uni
versity of California yesterday after
noon by defeating H. Rolfe, the last
of the men whom he has met and
beaten in the try-outs for the inter
collegiate tennis team. Wayne will
represent California against Stanford
on the 15th inst., when the intercol
legiate contest takes place. The short
tournament to determine who shall be
the second man to stand with Wayne
against Stanford began to-day. Wayne
defeated Baker Rolfe and Schmidt in
the finals and semi-finals, and these

after having the race won to all out
ward appearances. Wright kept his
mount well up the first mile and on the
far turn assumed command. There
seemed no chance of beating the first
choice in the run to the wir and from
the paddock on Wright probably eased
up somewhat. Invictus, a 15 to 1
chance, ridden by Graham closing
strongly on the, inside, nipped the fa
vorite a head on the wire to the speech
less astonishment of the crowd. In
spector Munro was third.
For baiting purposes the layers laid
2 to 1 against Gold Enamel, True Wing
and Prince Brutus in the first betting
on the final seven-furlong run. True
"Wing later on went to the post at 8 to
5. Gold Enamel finished the surprise
by easily taking the leading position
and finishing more than a length ahead
of Sea Air at the wire. True Wing
after a tempestuous voyage, ran into
the show.
TRACK XOTES.
The brooking fraternity appear in
no hurry to depart for the East this
spring. Twenty-three firms cut in
yesterday.
Sir Wilfred, it appears, was suffering
from an abscess on the leg and will
not have to be touched up with the
firing iron.
Dod Anderson received extensive
and knowing support, but Wright was
slow in getting the mare away.
F. W. Barr covered the four and a
half furlongs without ?rreat effort in
:64, which performance stamps him
as something of a two-year-old.
The stewards have under investiga
tion the freakish runs of Gold Enamel.
Beginning next week and continu
ing until the close of the meeting a
$1000 handicap will be run every
Tuesday and Thursday.
Horatius is suffering from a bowed
tendon and will be shelved for a time.

Sensational Work of Seattle
Twirler Against Commut
ers at Idora Park.
Devereaux, the Only Man to
Keaeh First, ls Hit by the
Twirler.
OAKLAND, April s.â Charley Hall,
that crack youthful sphere-server of
the Siwash tribe of balltossers, pitched
a no-hit-no-run game against the
Oaks this afternoon at Idora Park. He
did not pass an opponent to first on
called balls. The only pet of President
j Clay Hawbacker's contingent to reach
j first during the fray was old Wild Ca
nine Bill Devereaux, who was pre
sented with sack No. 1 in the sixth
spasm in exchange for a rib-roaster
that Hall shot into the clown third
baseman's mid-section.
Twirler Charley bewildered six of the
Commuters, including several of their
best wagon-tongue vvielders. into impo
tently cleaving the atmosphere. Hall
j was conspicuous with the club also.
I and laced out a three-bagger and a
single with his good stick. Miller, Seat
tle's right fielder, again shone with tne
bat and duplicated his record of three
hits made yesterday. Fourteen safe
bingles were garnered by the Si washes
from the deceivers handed out by Ham i
Iberg. Hall was given faultless sup- j
port, while the men behind Iberg blun
dered six times. Devereaux alone
breaking the error record for the sea- \
son at Idora Park by compelling Scorer '
McFarlin to write down four bungles |
opposite Bill's family name. Captain
Rip Van Haltren was afflicted with
that Osier feeling to-day, and did not
go into action. Billy Dunleavy, the
human juggernaut, commanded the
Commuters and directed the battle.
Umpire Gus Klopf has won the good
will and support of the fans by his
fair, fearless and impartial rulings,
and for the snap and spirit he infuses
into the games by ordering the players ;
to move lively. To-day's contest was
played in one hour and fifteen mlnues.

to bewilder the home sticke" and they
could only make good in one round,
when they coaxed a run over
Garvin ls about six feet two. He is
constructed like a two-by-four scakt
ling, but he has a whole lot. of speed
concealed in his salary wing. When hÂ»
turns loose with it there is little chance
for the opposing batsman to tear off
a safe bingle. Garvin had plenty of
command with him yesterday and th*
Seals were forced to swing at the ball
Instead of waiting for free passes to
the initial sack.
The Portlanders did all their run get
ting in r the nrat inning. Miller passed
Van Buren and Schlafley and Kido
McLean pushed a bingle through sec
ond. That formidable enemy of pitch
ers. Eddie Householder, leaned up
against a fast one and sent It out to
center far enough to clean off the bags
and win the game for Portland.
The Seals broke In with their only
run .in the second inning. One was
down when Irwin singled. Nealon
went out. but Gochnauer got a good
one The hit and run sign was passed,
along the line and Parke Wilson shot
one out to the right garden, putting
Irwin through with the only one San
Francisco made.
A clever throw to the pan by Wal
ters saved a run in the seventh spasm.
McCreedle had hit and was advanced
to second on an out. McLean tore a
slow one past Gochnauer and out. to
center- field. McCreedie was coming
right through on the hit, but Walters'
wing was true to the inch and he
caught McCreedie a foot from the plate.

The Key Jloute's new ferrj--boat San Pran
< isco -warn given her official trial trip yesterday
and fulfilled the promise rjf previous spins by
dpve'.oninr fill the speed htr contract calls ,'or.
From the Key Uoute I'ier at Oakland to hÂ«r
tllp at the ferry depot Â«he came in 11 minutes,
vMch Mwil cuts in half the time made by the
Southern Pacific boats. The San Francisco la
well -rangÂ»d and comfortably equipped and
will be a vzhiaMe addition to the yellow boat
Â«*-rvlce. wh: has hitherto beÂ«i "maintained
vuh two steamers. Captain Rasmussen' Â»i
loted â â â  San Francisco on yesterday's trial.
The San Francisco "made rood," but Manager
â R'Hli* F. Kelly is paid to have "fallen down '
In hjÂ» ccanicmsary arrangement*. On tbe red-
Irttered i&tions to the trial the word "Re
freshments" etood out in bold, blue type. The
trial larted from 11:25 a. m. until 1:25 p. m.
Of the t>f>9 business men who availed thÂ«>m
selvea of the extended hru>pitallty about 589
pinnÂ«Â«i their faith on the blue-lettered lereÂ«'l.
"TV* c?.n take the trlp.**-"they said. "and can
have luncheon on board, so the less of tlm<s
uiT! be unimportant." Kelly'* caterer Is eaid
to have gone back on hire, and wh<-n the 589
appetites, sharpened by the sea eir and the ex
hilaration of â â '. - transit, got through with
the "refreshments" the fruests were still look
ing for luncheon. The wicked : caterer, it is
*ats. had proviaed for only 100 iruerts, lnstea"!
cf Â«VK>, as Manager Kelly had ordered, and had
based his calculation* on Oakland and Berkeley
nrpetn^sr It is an ill wind that blcws nobody
â¢rood, however, and wben the San Francisco's
trial was over the eating housfÂ» in thÂ» vicinity
of the ferry had to contend with a lunch hour
rush all over again. But thÂ« San Francisco Is
a!l right. ' -. . --. . .

Groth' s hat. Judging by the size of the hat
left behind. Grotto's e*ioul<s have rested on the
cook's shoulders. But riah has a well wooled
bead and the crinkly hair accommodated itself
to Its greater responsibilities and L'rlah got

i< .md also may have hiÂ» old one by calling
for It. -

YAQUIS AGAIN
TAKE WARPATH
They Resume Depredations
and Murder, Causing Panic
Among People of Sonora
â i Â» . â
DEFY- THE SOLDIERS
T ot )Safe for Americans to
Go Into Region as the In
dia jis Are Hostile to Them
EL PASO, Tex., April s.â John St.
Clair, a well-known prospector, -whose
statements are considered reliable, has
returned frem the Yaqul country near
Ures, Sonora, and reports that the In
dians are again on the warpath. He
says that Malpuche, the old chief, ia at
the head of a band uf over fifty and is
devastating the whole country, murder
ing, pillaging and burning.
Grain and cattle ranches are being:
abandoned and the people are going
into the towns for protection. The
whole country is in a state of panic.
Mail routes between the small towns
have been abandoned and provisions
are getting scarce.
Although the country is overrun with
soldiers, the Indians are fearless and
continue their depredations. St. Clair
does not believe it is safe for Ameri
cans to go into the Yaqui country at
this time, as the Indians are very hos
tile to Americans.
While going from Ures to his camp
in the mountains St. Clair heard tiring
and ran into what had been an Indian
ambuscade. He found two dead Mexi
cans, who had been killed only a few
minutes before he reached the place.
The Yaquis are armed with rifles and
are well surmHed with rsrtrlrleps.
HARD HITTING BOXERS
TO MEET IN THE RING
Sulllvnn-Choynski and DrLscoll-TVnny
rights Promise Some Work
With the GloVes.
When Tom Sullivan and Young
Choynski meet to-night at Wood
ward's Pavilion before the Bay City
Athletic Club it will not be the first
time they have faced each other in
the ring. Once before they clashed
and after four rounds of fast and
clever fighting the verdict waa award
ed to Sullivan. Since that time Choyn
ski has become champion of the light
weight division and has shown
marked improvement in his work, but
his opponent has likewise advanced
in the game of slug and wallop and
when they meet to-night there will be
little to choose between them.
The Barney Driscoll-Harry Tenny |
fiyht for the bantam championship is
attracting widespread interest. These
little fighting marvels have met on
four occasions, each winning two de
cisions. They are the kind of scrap
pers that mix from gong to gong, j
never stopping until one or the other â¢
peeks the canvas. Driscoll is the j
champion by virtue of his last deci
sion over Tenny, but the latter hopes
to reverse that verdict ancl again be \
at the top of the bantam class.
Gus Kpster and Bill Johnston are
in condition to make their heavy
weight contest an interesting one.
Koster will have his hands full with
the Butrhertown wonder, who haa
shown considerable class in his work
outs.
Jack Rodney and Young Otts at 125
pounds, Jack Brown and Jim Brown
at 126, Jack Garrigan and Jack Con
roy at 115, and A. Burns and Danny
Murphy at 105 will complete the
evening's sport.
MRS. H. M. HASTINGS IS I <
RETURNED TO HER , FAMUjY
Aged Woman Who Loses Hey Way
From Defective Memory Ia
Found by Police.
Mrs. H. M. Hastings, who wandered
away from her home, 3048 Jackson
street, on Tuesday afternoon while out
for a walk, is once more back in her
home, to the great delight of hÂ«Â«r
chiidren. She was discovered by Po
lict-man L. G. Becker at 3:15 yester
day morning at the corner of Wash
ington and Battery streets, wandering
around in a helpless manner. Becker
at once noticed that she was a wom
an of refinement, but judged that her
extreme age had affected her mind.
She gave her name, but could not re
member her address. He escorted
her to the Harbor police station,
where every possible attention and
courtesy were shown her. With the
early issue of The Call the police
learned where Mrs. Hastings lived,
and at once telephoned to her daugh
ters, who rushed down to the station
and took her home. Mrs. Hastings
had evidently walked about all night.
She says she is very tired, but other
wise she is in her usual health.

NEW TORK, April 's.â The tntenttvm toin
. crÂ«aÂ»Â« the preferred stock 01 the Union Paclflo
by *IÂ«.,WU,V<Â« was not known to the WaJl
.Etreet public nr.tl. this > morning, and. was a
general aurx>rtse. . This incident formed the
central pmct of interest In UK day's stock
market. Union . Pacldc â  tva> b**a the -subject
of gceslp aad : surmise tor many months dur
leg the course of iU remarkable ri!Â«.-, but none ,
of the numerous cor.jt-ctures regarding It point-:
ec tÂ» tfae measure announced this morning. (
Tbis fact in ItajcU aroused a doubt that a large ;
pert ot the nti^rts ' which have circulated - re- j
g&rding this etoc* Â»crt lil-informed. The ef- ,
lect on the common etock was unfavorable, as ;
tv act ucnaiurai In view of the prior j>rlv- ,
llfcge of the preferred stock, now to be doubled
In amount to dividends 10 the extent of 4 per I
cent. *TZÂ»e common stock was offered heavily,
both fur * domestic and foreign' accounts. It '
wu vigorously supported however, ail day.
Brokers belore- the r.ihg â¢were making offers ,
tv take all the stock thÂ«* any one would a*ll. i
a&S the came brokers were diligent buyers up .
to the lev*; of last night The support was
then relaxed again, but renewed at any pc- ;
riods of acute weakness. Officials of the com- J
pany declined to add anything to : the official ;
circular as to the specific purpose for which ,
the pr>. >-.i,i of the tacks are to be used, or as '
Xv the propoaec time for issuing it. Asaer
tloDF were freely made, however, among the :
epecul&ior* in the stock that the project had '
to do with the proposed combination of Union j
Pacific with N*w Tork Central and Chicago j
and Northwestern. It was pointed out that j
President Jiarrtman. in matntaJning the wls- I
don: gf seeking financing capital requirements â 
throcgh the Issue of etock, â¢ rather than .
through the creatioa of fixed interest-bearing ;
ot>ligÂ«.tior., had interjected into the official cir- j
oular the remark, -'especially such a rise In
connection with acquisition of stocks of other I
ocmpaalea." . This was adduo^d to tnÂ£tcate '
â sj a merrer project was in v1(-Â«.v 1( -Â«. but Wall ;
Mreet had formed the opinion that thÂ« sup- i
posed merger was to be accomplished by the :
â¢atrhangt of bonds of a holding company for"
â¢KlctiAg aecortties, which would not involve:
a great outlay <*f cash. The prospect of a j
$100,000, 000 block of new stock, therefor*. \
j earn* ac a shock to sentiment, and emphaaized j
tbe effect of the huge volume of issues which ',
If being added to constantly from, many j
a*utrÂ»B The determined support of Union â 
Pacific Â»m supplemented by notable upward :
movements in a number of apeclal stocks, ao
tbat ttt depressing effect of the Union Pacific
announcement was raodined to a' considerable
extent. The railroad list, the Southern group.
anfl the Canadian Pacific were very strong. | â 
The only news to account for the movement :
â¢w Â»*i* rugreÂ«tl'-in. beiard on earnings and re
ports of possible dividend increases. Ameri
san Smelting headed another strong group, in- !
eluding thÂ« Lead stocks and some others In ;
affiliated melaJ trades. The United States .
Steel stocks were ajugglah most of the day. but
they tnrmsd up late to higher prices than were
tourhM yedterday and helped to nustaln. the
g-MÂ»*rs. list by eympathy. A miscellaneous list :
of industrial stocks i - showed j considerable
Ptrength. The railroad list as a whole, how
ever, was held back. . Sterling exchange.. waa .
strong again, in rpite of the great case of

r CHICAGO,' April s.â Strength in May wheat
was in evidence at the start, that option open
ing.%^%c higher, at $1 14^1 14%. Distant
deliveries, however, were weak, July â  being off I
%Â©'% c to %@%c. at 87%3Â«7%c. The : cause
of _the 1 strength of . May ~ was . .an z active , de
mand, from shorts in anticipation, of ; bull
raids. Weakness of the July ; and . September
"deliveries was < â  due â â ' to ' : lower ."; cables _. and ;" to
continued . favorable . weatljer conditions. . Frost
Was reported as far south as Texaa, - but ( tem
peratures" recorded I wÂ»rÂ« ' not â ' low enough to
suggest injury to the growing wheat
crop. - Conditions In the ? Northwest also -were;
most v favorable - for seeding, r-i State., reports
â  from Ohio, Kentucky and Missouri were re
oelvcdr- and > all ! were extremely, bearish. : â  Man
ipulation of . May by , the . bull 1 clique, however,
was enough of a factor to counterbalance all
thÂ«se bearish Influences. -*t As â â . the â  session ; pro
greeaod.the price of May mounted higher and
higher until It had reached $1 17%. Strength
of - May : gradually i started â a â¢ covering '- move-"

Mistaken Identity Conveys
Embarrassment to Benedict
Woman Hugs Him in Sight of Wife
He Experiences Difficulty in Explaining True
Situation to Better Half.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Miss Lillian Colburn, wearing a boy's 1
cap and an abbreviated fur cape,
arerred that her public caressing of
the good citizen was not of mischiev
ous, malicious or alcoholic inspiration.
as had been darkly hinted by Patrol-,
man Charles Brown, but was resultant
of an impulsive nature being deceived
as to the identity of him she hugged.
That she declined to disentwine her
arms from the pood citizen's neck when
both he and the policeman implored
her to do so was not owing to obstin
acy, but miglit be attributed to a sub
ordination of will by affectionate
ness of disposition. Until convinced
that she was embracing the wrong man
it was beyond her ability to release
him.
According to the narrative of the
good citizen, as recounted to Police
Judge Mogan. he and his wife were
walking northward on Kearny street
when he stopped to light his cigar at
the corner of Sacramento street, his
better half sauntering slowly to enable
him to overtake her without hastening
when he had obtained the desired fire.
The lighting operation consumed less
than a minute, and he had just started
to follow hiÃ life-partner when a fem
inine voice behind him exclaimed in
rapturous tone, "My darling one, can
it be you?" and the next instant his
throat was being c<-m pressed tightly
and the same voice â  i? pouring en
dearments into hi 6 right ear. "Lemme
go!" he shouted as he struggled, but
the pressure on his windpipe was in
tensified until his breathing was im
peded and the cigar dropped from his
lips. As he writhed to free himself
from the octopus-like clutch he caught
a fleeting glimpse of his wife's face,
and the expression thereon depicted did
not tend to promote his comfort. He
was close to the point of strangulation
when the policeman unclasped the hu
man tentacles and pinioned them.
"The situation was extremely embar
rassing," said the good citizen to the
court, for 1 had never before seen the
woman and the crowd that quickly
gathered seemed to think I had in
jured her in some way. Even my wife
was difficult to convince that it was
the first time the defendant and I had
met.
"What did you do it for?" His Honor
asked Miss Colburn.
1 thought th' gent was my husband,
who gave me th' shake eight years
ago," was the reply, "an' I couldn't
help throwing my arms 'roun' him,
because I'm of such a lovin' nacher.
If his wife feels sore I'm sorry for her
âI know what jealousy is myselfâ an'
I'll pologize to her."
"The officer says ' you were intoxi
cated and the man you hugged says
the same thing, so I must pronounce
you guilty of drunkenness in a public
place and disturbance of the peace.
Sentence to-morrow."

Several active members of the Gospel
Mission, on Pacific street, between San
some and Montgomery, informed Judge
Conlan that for five months after
James King was plucked as a brand
from the burning he behaved himself
most admirably, but thereafter he
seemed to gradually relapse to unright
eousness until he created the disturb
ance that resulted in his arrest by Pa
trolman James O'Connor.
Robert Dougherty, an esteemed in
mate of the mission, was painting a
signboard when Brother King sudden
ly and utterly without provocation pro
nounced the artistic endeavor "rotten"
and violently assaulted Brother Dough
erty until that gentleman sought refuge
out o' doors and found it in the pro
tecting arms of Patrolman O'Connor.
Then the infuriated pursuer transferred
his attack to the officer, who quickly
subdued him.
Among those who testified in the de
fendant's behalf was G. C. Westenberg.
superintendent of the mission, who
thought it was not alcoholic beverages,
but noxious fumes from a cellar in pro
cess of being fumigated, that upset
Brother King's mental equilibrium.
Several ladies were also prepared to
adduce corroborative testimony, but
they were not afforded opportunity to
do so, and the court imposed a fine of $5.
Attorney Horace Ford was before
Judge Cabaniss on the charge of hav
ing disturbed the peace of Judge Mo
gan's tribunal by rudely resenting
Bailiff Mahoney's endeavor to keep him
within the bounds of court decorum.
Four brother pleaders appeared for the
defense and a fifth legal luminary
strengthened the prosecution by testi
fying that the bailiff's action was Jus
tified by the defendant's conduct. The
bailiff averred that when he gently
placed his hand upon the defendant's
shoulder and as gently whispered an
admonitory "Not so loud, please," he
was rudely repulsed with the remark,
"No Irish Mick can make me keep
quiet." Asked if he were willing to
apologize to the bailiff. Mr. Ford said
he was not, so the court gave him until
this morning: to undergo a reversal of
decision or accept the penalty of con
viction for peace disturbance.

Frank Rentsheller, a sheetiron work

Fritz and emphasized his defense by
exercising with hie hands with such
recklessness as to impel the magistrate
to duck and dodge as if he were em-

bout.
"Cant you talk without the aid of
your hands?" Inquired his Honor,
adroitly squirming beyond reach of a
projecting index finger. "If you can't,
I'll get the bailiff to manacle you."
"Well, you see, it's just like this,"
said Mr. Rentsheller, thrusting his
bunches or fives into his trousers
pockets.
"I don't want to know what it was
just like, but what it really was," said
the court.

HAMMOND GIVES
FREE LIBRARY
Mining Expert Provides
for a Book Collection
of a Technical Nature
WILL" BENEFIT 3IINERS
Funds for Nucleus Will
Be Followed by Needed
Additions as Required
John Hays Hammond, now of New
York, but formerly of California, has
made a present to the citizens of San
Francisco, and the miners of this State
of a special library to consist of min
ing and metallurgical works. During
his recent visit to this city he gave to
Charles Q. Yale of the United States
Geological Survey a check for $5000
to be expended for the purchase of
bocks-, bookcases and whatever else
might be necessary for this library.
He made no particular conditions, his
intention, being to establish such a
library of technical works as will be
useful to the professional mining en
gineer, superintendent, the metallurg
ist and the ordinary every-day practi
cal miner. There will therefore be both
advanced and elementary works relat
ing to the subject.
Mr. Hammond desires that the li
brary be placed in the State Mining
Bureau, provided" the trustees of that
institution permit its use as a deposi
tory. But in case there Is at any time
a lack of room the library may be re
moved to any other suitable place in
this city where the public may have
access without any cost. That is to
to say, he wishes the books kept for
use In the city of San Francisco and
not elsewhere under any circumstances.
If it becc-mes desirable or necessary,
authority is given to present the en
tire collection to the San Francisco
free library.
The fund for the purchase of these
books is to be managed by Mr. Yale,
Louis Janin and the State Mineralo
gist. Methods of making expenditures
and purchases is left entirely in the
hands of these gentlemen. The library
of mining boc-ks ia to be kept as a sep
arate unit and always opened to the
public. Mr. Hammond has promised
that in case this sum already donated
is insufficient for the purpose, he will
be glad to see that the library is made
a complete one.
The library will be entirely independ
ent of the two mining libraries for
students at the University of Cali
fornia and the Stanford University.
The State Mining Bureau at the ferry
building has already quite a good nu
cleus for a library of this character,
but by reason of lack of funds very few
additions have been made during the
last eight or ten years. As a result
many of the editions are old and many
necessary books are lacking.

GRAY BROTHERS
STILL BLASTING
The Supervisors' Street Committee
â  yesterday considered the protests of
residents against the blasting now
being done by the Globe Grain and
Milling Compary in the block bounded
;by Montgomery, Lombard, Chestnut
! and Kearny streets. The attorney for
the residents stated that a blast had
broken the windows in a house at 179
Chestnut street, and that his attempts
to have the blasting stopped by the
I Police Depirment had been unsuccess
i ful. The committee held that the
permit granted to the company did
not give it the right to blast, and that
lit could be prosecuted for violating
â the ordinance. It was stated that
Oray Brothers have the contract for
the blasting and had stated that they
did not fear arrest, as their men had
been repeatedly arrested for blasting
at Twenty-sixth and Douglass streets-
The committee will meet to-day at
1 noon to request the City Attorney to
brinj injunction proceedings to pre
vent the blasting on the street and
from removing any dirt therefrom.
A. S. Lillie of the Mission Federated
Clubs asked the committee to direct
the Board of Works to cause the
j streets to be swept properly.. Lillie
1 said th*Â» streets in the Mission dis
tricts were littered with rubbish and
had not been cleaned in six months,
and he had complained repeatedly to
the hoard named, but without avail,
and the taxpayers should be afforded
some relief in the premises. Lillie
said Mayor Schmitz had promised
that the streets would be swept after
April 1, but little or nothing had been
done. The committee decided to in
vestigate the complaint next Wednes
day afternoon.
