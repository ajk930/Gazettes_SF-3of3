of this scare, which was serious enongh
while it lasted, - Is .-that * there ; was not
.one single circumstance. to justify it.
" The, excitement started early in the
day, when . the newspapers announced
the "departure of the Russian Baltic
squadron '-from Vfgo. The publi.c was
'not In' possession of .the Information
cabled by .'the press to the United States
that only the officers concerned in the
firing on. tlie Britis"h trailers would be

came mare serious, until, at last. the cli

ment "that â¢ the British fleet had . cleared,
for action. "Some. .even said "that the
fleet had -sailed tc* meet Rojestvensky's.
squadron, vln huge type the papers
made* the parallel statements: "The.
Russian Sleet- Has Sailed." "The Brit
ish-Fleet Has Cleared for Action."
' No ' newspaper and no person .seemed
able to explain these ' movements. Tha
reassuring Information from the United
States that the sailing of the Baltic
squadron . from Vlgo * was -with' .the
knowledge of 'and agreeable '-to the
British Government was not even nftt
ed at by the papers here." â¢ â¢ .
The news from Gibraltar became
more .and .more alarmist and finally
the Foreign Office . was overrun by re
porters, some- of whom brought tha
â¢ rumor Â¦ that Admiral Beresford had
already sunk . the remnant of Admiral
Rojestvensky's fleet. Embaasador

, NEW YORK, Nov. Lâ An audience
that* filled Elk's J Hall, Jersey City, to
overflowing ' remained 1 until * 10:50
o'clock to-night to " greet Judge Parker.
He said\in-part: ' - â¢Â¦* < V
- Because we - are- opposed to ' the purchase of
the electorate and have felt It our duty to say
so. those wUo would corrupt It to the end that
their power to plunder the people may continue

that, tiia buaine" 1 *- interest* would , not . be . safe
with a Democratic administration. As I have

And if, under a government of constitutional
restraint^ and regard tor Jaw, we have been
able, through peace and war. foreign and In
ternecine, to grow from a population of 3.000,00Â©
to one of 80,000.000, why may we not go on un
til we have doubled that- number? Wh> 'should
we now consent to take even the first step
which, "according to Its advocates, is certain
to lead us to what they xall "empire?" â¢
Taking up the' trust questioW, Judge
Parker said: â¢ . . .;."
â¢ It is â¢ conceded that during the last tHree
or four years the increase â¢ in tbtf cost of liv
ing has amounted to one-sixth. Secretary
Shaw rejoices In it, and 'he *ays.lhe wÂ«gea of
the workingmen and. the lncomp of our people
are greater in proportion. Now,, if that is
true, the householders of this country - know
it. If not, their wives do. They know whether
the i Income of th# breadwinner Is .greater by
one-sixth than H was four years ago. There
are instance* in .which it Is. But in the great
majority of cases you will find it is not true.
Tou will discover that it requires ju.st a little
more work on your - part and more care on
the part' of . your .-.wives to make both ends
meet from month to month. Now, why Is' it
that the prices of the things, we have to have
are' pushed-, up a little' from time to time,
whether there be Improvement In our incomes
or not? Is It not in part because the business
of this, country to-day is largely tn control of
combinations or I trusts > which are enabled to
shut . out Â¦ competition ; and thus control prices
arbitrarily? â¢ '. ~ Â¦
: When an individual violates the law the law
punishes him. When a corporation violates
the law the - law should : punish It. A corpo
ration is â¢ no more entitled to immunity from
the consequences of Its wrongful acts \ than
the individual.. A combination of Individuals
to control 'the; market -price- of '.product* .of
any kind is void. ' A combination of ..corpora
tions for a similar, purpose is alike void. We
would not hesitate for a moment to prosecute
the individuals thus violating the law for the
purpose of oppressing the 1 people. Â¦
â¢ Overwhelming in importance tower the ques
tions ;- Shall â¢ the . partnership between the Re
publican ' leader* and the trusts continue with'
profit to both' and hurt to the ' country? Shall
the. trusts'-' contributions 'Of 'millions -to the
campaign - fund secure ' the right to continue
wrongful taking of millions a year from . the
people? â¢ 'â¢ ' *
We are asked, then, to turn -away from the
assured triumphs which a* popular systein-^
laitiillar as household words â has brought to
ua and to adopt methods which, opposed to all.
our traditions, have not even the merit.of suc
cess, or of bringing self-government, 'happiness
and contentment to. a tingle people thug far
subjected to 'them. JVe may well enter our
protest against such a ' policy. W'c feel and
know that that charter.of our liberty by which
our people have guarded their course . for "mote
than a - century and a quarter has -not "been
lost. . " . . . â¢ â¢ .
It -is that kind of expansion upon "which we
are invited to look with favor. We are aaked
to turrf from our own mighty but peaceful
triumphs, from the. spectacle .of. a -. continent
settled by a homogeneous "people" attached to
liberty, fitted to govern . theroeelves, .in order
thai we may enter upon the beginning of a
policy which must inevitably end -in the adopt
tibn of * the other methods .which I have bo
briefly and so Imperfectly outlined. ' :-^>'<

by which trie United States was peo
pled, beginning- Â¦* with â¢ a- narrow i fringe
of .population alon^ .' the .Atlantic
Cc-ast, ina sprea'ding steadily across
the continent, speaking the 'same lan

It is this expansion, natural, inevitable, al
most as silent as the tides of the ocean, which

Judiciary and the Legislature addressed
the mecttn'g, \ and then the meeting
broke up with cheers for the whole
Union 'Labor- ticket. .
In* conclusion, Mr. Livernash referred
to the reported differences" existing be
tween " Mayor Schmitz. . and " himself.
"Look at us now," he said, "u'Don the
'same platform advocating the â¢ same
principles, -disciples of- the 'same truths.
.Truly we are as one." Mayor; Schmitz
smired and nodded approvaj."' "i .' . :
' A little- of broad kindliness, a little of tact
on the p.art of San Francisco employers would
do. marvels, toward pipmotlng happier indus
trial -life In this community. I say this without
bitterness. Employers and employes will never
be. quite* of one mind, t take it: but there is
no sound excuse . for some . of the differences
ncÂ»r dividing- them.
Â¦ Jt seems to me that here in San Francisco
there would be sounder industrial conditions .if
the beet of the leading .men of wealth and the
best of th.e leading men of labor met more
frequently .'and knew one another better. | The
aloofness characterizing their relations Is not
conducive to the understanding of the difficul
ties of . capital by the labor men nor the diffi
culties of 'labor -by the capitalists. - Both sides
need fuller Information: of 'the', whole Industrial
sltnallon." - If - each pi<ie-V possessed . a - larger
knowjedge of, the other's .trials ' and deMrea
there- wouM be fewer -strikes, 'fewer ' lockouts.'
.'There Is too much arrogance on the part of
some employers Â¦ and too much â¢ arrogance on
the part of some representatives of labor
unions: but it will not do on the one account
to condemn all employers or on the other to
condemn all union representatives.. Â¦ -Â¦Â¦-Â¦Â¦
The labor and capital-problems are not going
to be solved by the men who judge by -the
extremes, but by the men who., judge I by'
average tendencies and so judging set to work

Continuing,' Mr. Livernash said
The Mayor next voiced his disbelief
in the published resolution of the Citi
zens' Alliance that it is its intention to
keep out of politics, and, asserting that
In his opinion the Citizens' "Alliance is
in politics, urged the friends of j union
labor to stand together to. resist lactlv
ity oh the part of the opposition. Mayor
Schmitz gave way to Congressman
Livernash, who, in the course of his re
marks,'said:
There are few papers In San Francisco that
are advocating our cause, nor will thuy In the
future, but some of them though not taking
up the burden Of our fight, are proceeding
upon lines of fairness and Justice. In thU
regard the action of The Call U commendable.
It Is supporting Its principles, but In fairness
to all It is giving the views of all and decries

T. F. Finn was chairman of the meet
ing. He first called upon Thomas F.
Egan, -chairman of 'the Union Labor
Party County Committee,- to address
the audience.. Egan did not , occupy
much time in discussing the issues,'be
cause it was apparent to him.as It was
to- everybody : else, that the audience
wanted to -hear from Mayor Schmitz.
When the Mayor was introduced he
was enthusiastically cheered. He im
mediately entered upon a defense of his
administration, saying in part: ;.
\ will ask you. by way of introduction, to
support every man whose name appears upon
the union labor ballot because. In my opinion,
they represent the Interests of union labor.
It has been charged that union labor admlnla
tratlon* are not of the best, but. I ask that
you look at the record the party has made
durinR. the last three years. â¢ Â¦ Every t obstacle
possible has bÂ«en placed In the way . of the
ad minis tra talon, - and*^even now conspirators
against uc are active. We have no paper
that will take up our defense, hence. It Is
more necessary .that we be on our guard. ' -
"Sc-me of political -.opponents
have had much to "say 'about militarism
and the spirit of militarism. There is
no spirit of militarism which is a men
ace to V our ',-; country. The soldiers of
the , republic . have always been its
friends and not its enemies. The young
men studying, military tactics . here are
learning the , lessons of patriotism j and
learning to be. good citizens. They are
not laying foundations which will be
a menace to ; our national welfare, but
to give strength. "to. our institutions.
Here, oh the, one hand, are the cadets
and, on the other, the school children
bearing, the';flag .of the^'republic. You
young, men are learning how better to
protect , it ; j against its enemies the

at Goshen, Elkhart and South Bend.'

': Although Stuart's Dyspepsia .Tabhsts
have' been , In the market only ,a few
years, . yet probably every druggist in
the' United States,. Canada and Great

them the most popular and successful

"I was surprised, at the end of tha
first week to note a marked Improve-
ment In my appetite and general health
and before the two packages were gone
I was certain that Stuart's Dyspepsia.
Tablets was going to . cure completely
and they did not disappoint me. I can
eat and sleep and enjoy my coffee and
cigar and no one would suppose I. had
ever known the horrors of dyspepsia. Â¦
- "Out of friendly curiosity I wrote to
the proprietors of the remedy asking
for Information as to what ' the tablets
contained . and they replied ; th'at the
principal Ingredients v.-ere aseptic pep-
sin (government test), malt diastase
and other natural digestives, which dlV
gest' food regardless of .the condition of
the stomach."' ." / Â¦'-"- r., \ 'Â¦*>'
The root of the matter is 'this, the
digestive elements contained In Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets will digest' the food,
give the overworked stomach a chance
to recuperate and the nerves and whole
system receive the nourishment which
can only come from food; stimulants
and 'nerve tonics â¢ never give .real
strength; they give a fictitious strength
invariably. followed by reaction. Every
drop of blood, every nerve and tissue is
manufactured from our dally food and
if you can Insure its prompt action and
complete digestion .by \ thÂ« regular uae
of so good and wholesome* a remedy as
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, 'you.wlll
have no need of nerve tonics and sani-
tariums. Â¦Â¦-Â¦Â¦'
"To make a long story short I finally
bo.ught a- couple .of packages at the
.nearest dmg store and. took two or
three 'tablets after each meal and occa-
sionally a tablet between meals when I
felt any feeling of nausea or discom-
fort. â¢'
" A mark" of large, affairs in 'one of our
.prprnlnent Eastern cities, by . too close
attention to. business, too little -exercise
and too ma"ny. club dinners, finally be-
gan to -pay' nature's, tax, levied in .the
form of chronic . stomach -trouble; the
failure of .his digestion brought about
a .nervous Irritability,- making it impos-
sible to apply himself to his daily busi-
ness and- finally deranging the kidneys
and heart. â¢ ' ' â¢ . ' -. .
In his own words he savs: ' "I -eon-
suited one -physician after another* and
each 'one Â¦ seemed to understand rnjr
case, but all the same they each failed
to. bring about the return of my former
digestion, appetite, and vigor. ' For two

in early days, died suddenly last night

was 71 veaFS old. Heart failure .caused
his death. Mr. Hemme's first loca

Contra Costa Cdunty,- where he- pur
chased 300.0 acres In early dayÂ» and
created a beautiful country place.' -In
the days of the Comstock mining ex
citement Hemme was rated, as a mil
lionaire. His fortune was dissipate.!
in the '70s,' however, and he lived
quietly after that at his home in
Berkeley. His philanthropy was well
known, especially . in church circles.
He. contributed to the old ". Calvary

churches of Sari Francisco sunn ag
gregating^ $150,000. He Was a Mason,

"We are able to show that for im
passioned verse many syllables are
used with a corresponding effect upon
the heart, while for solemn,- sublime
subjects the syllables decrease, and
likewise the pulse-beats. It is my pur-,
pose, before- concluding the experi
ments, to record the singing of an en
tire congregation on a phonographic
record arid see how the law holds for
audiences as* well as for individuals."
."You might. as well declare," said Dr.
Dixon, "that Â¦& man on horseback is jlh
the same position as .a man a-foot as
to speak ct poetry and .prose as."practi

Tall, gaunt, quick^of wit and always
among those. present at" every public
gathering of political import, the famil
iar negro- passed on last' night after
months of suffering. Waters was fifty
three^ years old, a Jamaican by birth.
He khew.'the'.'diBease had fastened its
fatal .fingers upon him, : but the. "majah"
was sure he could conquer the deadly
germs if he could only procure some of
the old time "yarbs" that 'grew In the
sc-uthland whence he- came. But the
herbs did not. materialize. Poverty and
his illness forced him at last upon the
county'9 charity and at the infirmary
last night the end -came. .
' For ' many years "Majah" Waters
was daily on parade. '. In tinies of ad
versity he" clung,' to the well worn and
dingy garments of his following. In the
old days he worked at chimney clean
ing .and. eked .out. a living therefrom,
adding a bit by serving as supernumer
ary in the political parades. On Sun
days the "majah" was transformed. He
retained : in 'his wardrobe, s.lender as
Oliver " Goldsmith's, one suit of black
broadcloth with the accompanying tall
beaver, and -patent leather shoes. In
his heyday he "was in his glory and on
the afternoon swing about town was
in evidence:: ' ".. . ...
The' "rhajah"Vwas a favorite in the
cakewalklrig; times. " There was none
more' resplendent than the lanky negro.
Rheumatism stiffened him a bit, but
h.e was' always ready for a frolic and
the "white" folks" always played him
for a "favorite in" the many contests
that the "majahV led. " . â¢ ;:. : ';

the funeral.," A widow survives him.

in consequence.
The order, apparently, Is the out
come of Captain Nance's comments
upon the students' behavior upon en
trance to the classroom In the hall a
week ago. At that time Captain Nance
severely criticized the students for their
alleged noisy and "childish" behavior.
He objected to the manner In which
they pushed the chairs about and the

Proposed Withdrawal of a

Â¦ 'The', main objection to the Â¦changing',
o"f the' fcotfrtdaries -of . the' park arises
out of the fact, well known to all fire*
quenters of. the Sierra- Nevada . Moun
tains, especially. : the' -rangers ~ and
guides, 'that the dieer, bear and- game
of .all kinds' 'and -birds descend froia
the high altitudes during the- severity'
of the winter weather,. when the snow
is on the ground, and. re treat: to the

' According to - the . latest V advices

bo Induced to appropriate a sufficient
sum to purchase the patented lands
within the park boundaries and there
fore they have made up their "minds tp'
recommend that a change be made in
thV boundary lines, of Â¦ the Tosemite

This will enable Ward; and his friend3
to take their electric. line up to within

Another important ,step taken- by
the promoters .was to obtain a rlghtof
way through the Sierra forestry reser
vation, which Includes within its boun
daries ranges, 16, 17 "and" 18 east, lyirig
west of ' the' Yosemlte National Park
boundary. In February, .1903, the
Yosemite Valley Railroad Â¦ Company
filed a map with, the Secretary of the
Interior for- the proposed, right of way
foi the electric road across public
lands .up to" a. point on the boundary
of the Yosemite*. Park,, the "proposed
route . following the course, of the Mer-.
ced. River. In January .'. of this year
the Secretary' of the Interior- made *n
order, eliminating . . from the :. Sierra
reservation tracts ; of land along.tne
Merced River,, in the -Merced. Canyon.
in Ranges 16." 17.--; and; 18. through
which the electric ' railroad ' company
proposes to â¢ obtain ; its "2 right , of > way:
In the .same month the Secretary ,of
the Interior also notified the Registrar
of the Land Office* at Stockton that
the subdivision of -land along the'river
in the canyon had' been eliminated
from the Sierra -reservation. The.fll
lngof' this map,' showing? a terminus
at the-boundary line.-of the 'Yosemite.
Park, leaves the Ward railroad at a
SEQURES RIGHTS OF WAY".
The promoters have, succeeded in
their scheme- to the extent o"f procur
ing the survey of the land lying along'
the Merced River in *tnÂ«r canyon from
the falls up to' the boundary - line of
the- par-k ana through the' boundary
line up to ...within half a mile-of the
.'tntrance-.to ther Yosfmlte Volley/^nd
in bringing abcuit the' Incorporation ' In
this city on December 18/ 1902, ift the
Yosemlte Valley " Railroa'd .Company,
which was "capitalized. ..at -55,000,000.
Having j this- land arid : a' number . of
mining claims in the canyon and hav
ing acquired the different.water rights,
it becomes heeesst.ry .for-' the further
ance of Ward's electric- road 'compariy
that the "way- be opened' throu'gh" the
Sierra Reservation in ranges/ 15*. 16; 17
and 18. and through the Yosemite.Na
tional Park, ranges 19 and. 20, in order
to permit the road to reach the Valley.
In order to bripg about- this desired
result it >vas necessary to have action
taken by Congress and toward that
end Engineer Ray was sent to Wash
ington, where he lived at the Wlllard
Hotel while acting as the legislative
agent of. Ward during "the last two.
sessions of Congress. That Ray's pres
ence.-in- Washington was effective in
behalf of the electric project . of -Ward
was shown By the introduction of .the
bill, which failed to. pass, but .which â¢
resulted in a clause being. injected into
the sundry civil appropriation act pro
viding for the : appointment of . a /com
mission to pave the way for elimlnat-",
ing certain lands from the public do

j Assisted by . En"gineer s Ray,-.who Is a
man 'of - great perseveranpe 'and per
tinacity-. Ward has been promoting- the
formation of an' electric railroad com
pany, Which has in -vjew. a proposed
line of road " from â¢ Merc'e.d â¢ up -to. the

posed withdrawal of lands from the

scheme is supposed *~ ;be aayndlcate Â¦
represented by Captain "A. H. Ward,
owner of conside^abte ; land. Ih the na

well known 'ciyjl engineer.. "Ward has,
from time to time, been quietly ac
cumulating land within the boundaries
of the national and it is well,
known in that, section , that; for years
he has been working = with : one single
object in view, and .that : is to- open up
a roadway from the San- Joaquin Val
ley along the "Merced Canjcon.' to and
through the national -park to the-.en

a- light blow on the head and the fight
was given to Oans on a'foul." From the

â¢ Judge Mogan sent. 19-year-old' Wil
lie Bloom, accused of burglary, to an
swer in the Superior .Court, with ball
fixed at $1000. The youth was cap
tured, by Mrs: McElroy as he was
ransacking a room in her .house- at
279 .Stevenson- street. . '-'"':'
Lena Williams,- buxom, big-hatted
and sealskinned. . did not. look like a
vagrant as she faced Judge Cabaniss,
but Patrolman Barry proved conclu
sively that she had no legitimate
means of support, although she pro
fessed to be a masseuse at 405 Kearny
street: Sentence to-morrow.
â¢ Patrolmen Thompson and Cullinan
inadvertently paid tribute to the.
vigilance .and energy . of their com
rades patrollingithe North End.
"The bums and beggars are so
harassed north of Market street,"
was Thompson's statement, indorsed
by Cullinan, "that they have shifted
their scene, of operations to .south of
the slot. We arrested this man. WiW
Ham Mullen, for begging at Fourtn
and Market streets. He was forced to
abandon hls : former beat, ; on
Kearny." . "
After the defendant had been pro
nounced guilty and ordered to appear
for sentence to-day the same officers'
accused William Dunn of having In
terfered .with .them when they arrest
ed Mullen. . Mr. Dunn pleaded ignor
ance of the fact that the officers .were
officers,* as* they %ere .in' plain aftlre
when he remonstrated against their
arrest of Mullen, but Judge Mogan
ignored the plea and fined him $5 for
butting in. ' " â¢ â¢ ) Â¦ â¢ "'
After his fight with Eugenio Cress!
night before last at 2815 Twenty
third street Louis Casa Grande .went
to Patrolman Rottanzl and, surren
dering a large knife, opined : that he
had seriously stabbed his opponent
and desired to be taken into custody.
His request was complied with, and
the charge placed against his name
was . assault with a deadly weapon,
but when the' case was called . in
court the complaint was pronounced
faulty, inasmuch as Mr. Cressi was
not cut with. the knife nor was there
evidence to show .that he had been
attacked with it. -. So a continuance,
was ordered to give the policeman
time to amend his accusation. .
W. Cashman of 268 Dolores street
was among, those present at the
Britt-Gans affair. While purchasing
his ticket at the Pavilion entrance
Mr. Cashman accidentally dropped a
$10: gold piece, and. ere he could re
cover the coin Master George Line
han picked it up and ran away. Pa
trolman L. Cornelius soon caught
Master Linehan, who had secreted the
money in his mouth. When the
case was called in Judge Mogan's
court Mr. Cashman failed to appear,
and a suboena was Issued to com
pel his attendance to-day.
A jury in Judge Mogan's court ac
quitted Mrs. Laura Aguirre of the
charge of battery svorn to by Mrs.
Alfonse de Lucca, who testified that
on September 27, after alienating
the affections of Mr. de Lucca, the de
fendant met her at Mason and Wash
ington streets and * pulled her hair
and choked her. Mrs. Aguirre not
only denied having stolen the love, of
Mr. de Lucca, but declared that her
assault on Mrs. de Lucca was in the
line of self-defense, as that lady
opened hostilities by bombarding
her with potatoes, which . she was
carrying from a grocery to her home.
The Jury took Mrs. Aguirre's word
for it.
another claimant to her affections?
The Judge gave himself twenty-four
hours. to think it over.
Miss Smith explained to Judge Mogan
that; the Â¦_Â¦ fact of the other defendant
and herself being similarly surnamed
was simply a remarkable coincidence,
as their only relationship" was that of
wooer and wooed. It was net her fault
that Mr. Smith sometimes/visited her
at unconventional' hours, nor did -she
think- she ought to be blamed for dis
couraging his attentions at such times.
Surely she" should* not be held partly
responsible for the -e"bullition of his
Jealousy.- that led to" their joint arrest.
Was it hot enough to* have her. beauty
slumber disturbed and her life threat
ened by him without being forced to
undergo., the additional discomfort of
spending. the remainder of the night in
prison?. "What protection did- a lone
lady, have, : any way, from : the unpro
voked Â¦' frenzy Â¦ of a jealous admirer?
"Was she to; tamely^ submit "to having*
her, .apartment invaded' at any ' or: all
hours of the night, by- a ! madman: in
quest of a. rival, lor-wasahe to resist
such , invasion : and- thereby 1 ' invite ar
rest for/disturbing the peace? -Would
tthe' Judge f.klndlyienlighten>her ;aa fcto>
.what :>. her .iproperrcourseKOfJ conduct

sisted '; <ml: searching 'i her t chamber- to

Miss Jennie Smith was so scantily at
tired while. J. H. ; Smith was pursuing
her through the corridors of the. Dew'ey
House on Fourth street at. 2 .o'clock
yesterday morning, that the policeman
who arrested both of , them for disturb:
ing the peace was considerably, em
barrassed until' the lady consented to
visit her apartment and don her street
costume. , ." / ' â¢ . '
Then the policeman who arrested the
defendants expressed regret that Mr.
Sullivan did hot talk In that way ber
fore , the arrests .were made and Mr.
-Sullivan . reminded the policeman -that
he (Mr. -S.) had been drinking when he
opined that the., ladies might have
taken his i purse.". 'Â¦ . > . .
Case, dismissed and* apparent satis"
faction of all concerned â except the
policeman. . . .Â¦Â¦'.'- . '
Watchman Sullivan of the City and
County Hospital "expressed profound
regret that Mrs. Margaret Farmer and
Mrs. Emma "Burns had been subjected
to the. humiliation of . arrest and ar
raignment on the charge of having
] stolen -Jiis. purse. . The two ladies were
iamong his most highly esteemed ac
quaintances, ' he informed ; Judge Cab
aniss, else he" would hot have invited
them to partake of liquid refreshments
when he. met -them on .the street. His
purse â¢ mysteriously"" disappeared, ; ,he
confessed, but to even .suspect | either
Mrs. Farmer or Mrs. Burns of. pilfering
it would be little short c-f an outrage.
: "If you knew 'em. as well as I know
'em, 'Judge, you'd cut off . your right
arm before, you'd believe that they
took. my purse. It's all a mistakeâ a
terrible mistake." > - .'.-'.-' .â¢.Â¦-Â¦Â¦ " â¢
Hearing continued till Thursday,
after the court- had taken' a"inental
j-hotograph of ' Mrs. Rose's damaged
eye.: ' : " Â¦ " ';' : . ' Â¦
| Mrs. -Hugh Rose's bruised and dls
â¢,-colored eye was lntroduced'as evidence
rfor the defense in the case of her hus
j band, Hugh Rose, teamster, of .9 De
i catur street, who was charged with
'having bruised and blackened an optic
the property of Â¦William 'H. Ballinger,
j wool sptteivof llj DecStitr etreet. - Â¦ â¢ . \
\. It" was > Jn r r^tallati<iii'ld'r the smitlng ;
, of his wife's eye by-'MfrBallinger that
; Mr. Rose fSmote 'that gentleman's eye,
the defendant's' attorney explained,
land he would like to have Judge Mo
gan note. Mrs. Rose's, eye ere time re
duced its tumefaction and removed its
.discoloration. Mrs. , Rose had ~ not
given any provocation to Mr., Ballinger
.for the assault committed by him, the
'.lawyer "declared. But, so far as that
j went, what could any member of the
â¢ gentler sex say or do. that would.Jus
tify the punishment visited upon Mrs.
Rose by .Mr. Ballinger? Would not a
manâ he would repeat the term; a
man^have instinctively submitted to
j any /indignity from a woman ere- he
j would have blackened Hjer eye ? And
ijajt. for Mr. Rose's alleged blackening
I of the Ballingef eye, could any mari-^
Â¦imark you, any manâ whose wife had
been assaulted as Mrs. Rose was'.as
j saulted, have : abstained ; from doing
j exactly what Mr. Rose 'was alleged '.to
i have done?. : ' ' . â¢_ .
Naughty little ,, boys exasperated
Mrs. J. M. Frantz by congregating
upon the front steps of her house in
the 24 OQ block of Sacramento street,
and when she caught Johnny Hill. and
cuffed him she was arrested on com
plaint of Mrs. John Feeney, a neigh
bor, who alleged battery. _ . .
. Mrs., Frantz told Judge Gabariiss
that so harassed -was she by the Juve
nile conventions -on her front steps
that she could not continue to reside
{there if they were permitted to con
j trnue, and that she did not assail Mas
i ter Hill until she had - exhausted her
{repertoire of cajolery. Mrs. Feeney
j testified that Mrs. Fraritz not only
slapped Johnny's head, but kicked an
! other section of his anatomy. Mrs.
| Frantz'- indignantly denied the kick
|lng.\; Â¦ : â¢ , ... .' . . :Â¦ .
t The .case was continued till Novem
| ber 22; Mrs. Frantz being allowed to
; go on her own recognizance and the
, other ladies advised to restrain their
"offspring, from making a trysting place
of. the Fran U front steps.. .
Strenuous effort -was made by the
woman's attorney to. prevent the stew
ard's statement , being" heard, â¢ but | Po
lice. Judge Mogan overruled all ob
jfcctiona from that source and ordered
that-the testimony go on record. Then
the hearing was continued till to-day,
when the surgeon who dressed Par
ker's wounds will testify and Parker
himself may be recalled to the stand.
Sallowed and emaciated by his hos
pital experience, Parker looked very
unhappy as Steward Canous im
peached his story, told In court the
previous day, that he was stabbed by
accidentally falling upon a knife with
which he was cutting meat for a cat,
and that his paramour was not near
him at the time. The. woman sat be
side Parker during the. steward's re
cital and she, too, was visibly annoyed
by it. ... - . .
Edmund Parker's 'sworn statement
that May Parker did not stab him was
impeached yesterday by the testimony
of A. J. Canous,.'a steward at the City
Receiving Hospital,*, who- had charge
of the ambulance in' which the wound
ed man -was removed from 22 Tehama
street shortly after his wounds were
received one night about a month ago.
Whie en route to ; the hospital, the
steward testified, Parker told him he
had been stabbed/ and .when May Par
ker was brought to * the . patient "for
identification she' exclaimed: "For
God's sake,' don't send 'me to Jail for
stabbing you." ,- Subsequently the
wounded man asked the steward what
he . would do if he had been stabbed
by a woman. -..;. / .

of a Scathing arraignment of Russian bureaucratic government and
the weak and vacillating Czar at its head: -After .passing in review,
the several features of reactionary policy that characterize the des
potism of the Czar's Ministers, Mr. White fixes upon the oppression

The policy of the ruling, nobles in the realm, so forcefully ex

most progressive people,; is due to an absolute" indifference to,- even
antagonism against, all influences of. enlightened government, as
White shows ; but in- the case of Nicholas this medievalism; set
with equal stubbornness' in ihis] character, ; is by ; an
utter indifference to the needs of his people, a stolid-ignorance of all

ALL SAINTS' DAY
IS OBSERVED
As his own attorney and leading wit
ness Isaae Selby was the central figure
in .Judge Sloss* court yesterday in the
trial of his suit against Ponald Mc-
Rae for $25,100 damages for the aliena^
tion of the former Mrs. Selby's affec
tions. Selby was a minister of the gos
pel in Australia, a lecturer, author, pol
itician and book agent by turns. His
wife recently obtained a divorce from
him on the ground of neglect and that
case was also a novel one by reason of
Selby's appearance In the role of law
yer, defendant and counter-complain
ant. McRae is a furniture dealer and
he and Mrs. Selby were partners in
lodging-house ventures during Selby's
absence in Australia. Selby claimed
to have discovered an "emotional re
lationship" between theni, hence the
present suit.. '.- -â¢
At the opening of yesterday's pro
ceedings Selby read a long- statement
of what he expected to prove. It began
with his ministry in Melbourne and
his good standing In the. Church of
Christ He left, he said, with his wife
and children on a lecturing tour of the
world : armed with high recommenda
tions to churchmen. He lectured in the
East and then came to San Francisco.
His work" did not prosper here and he
returned to Australia, leaving his fam
ily, behindt There he ran" for the Fed
eral Parliament and was defeated, he
says, .because the Melbourne Age
charged that he iiad no domicile, hav
ing left his family. in America. His
wife refused to come to him, although
he offered to send .her money.
Both in his statement and in his tes
timony the aggrieved husband declared
that Mrs. Selby told him nothing of
her business relations with McRae.
For many years one of the leading
lines of Catton, Bell & Co. has been
the sale of a certain, sheep dip. After
W. F. Clark & Co. started in Business,
taking up . several lines similar to
those carried in the market by Catton,
Bell &" Co., it was found by Catton,
Bell .& CO. that they had a sharp
competition to meet in the sale of
sheep dip. The price was cut' by the
new concern. During correspondence
with sheep men Catton,' Bell & Co. is
sued a circular concerning . the dip.
This circular caused a suit for $100,
.000 damages. "
In the schedule that was filed yes
terday,' accompanying the petitions -in
bankruptcy of Clark. & Bro. and -W.
F. Clark, it appeared that the firm
was a heaw borrower of money. The
sum of $12,142 97 3 due on- notes to
M. A. Newell of 318 California street.
A. C. Clark, the wife of W. F. Clark,
holds a chattel mortgage on office fix
tures amounting to $5000. The Cam
eron & Cameron C6mpany of Rich
mond-, Va., is represented, in the
claims against the firm by promis
sory notes for $5000. The total of
borrowed money is about $22,000, or
two-thiraj) of the total indebtedness.
Among the creditors- for merchan
dise . furnished are Sullivan Bros.,
$2800; F. A. Robblns, $2577; the San
Francisco Sulphur Company, $2669;
La Sociedad Anonimade Hiladosa y
Tejidosde Cantel, Limited, of Quezal
tenango, Guatemala, . an account In
court, $2644 10. Then there artf les
ser amounts, of a few hundred dollars
each that are due in Eastern States.
In the schedule of assets was in
cluded a \ memorandum to the effect
that "there is alao pending in the.Su
perior Court; for the city and county
of San Francisco . a suit* to recover
$100,000 damages from Catton, Bell
& Co. for slander." Among the prin
cipal assets of the firm are the stock
in trade, which is estimated to be
worth $6385, which is pledged; and
book acounts amounting to $3163 50.
W.:F. Clark declined to say anything
about the immediate cause of the
failure of his firm. ,. Catton,- Bell &
Co. professed ignorance, pf the busi
ness-of 'the bankrupts. . . .
W. F. Clark &Bro: and XV. F. Clark
filed petitions in- bankruptcy yester
day in the .United States Pistrlct Court
for the NorthefA * District' of Califor
nia. W. F, Clai-k jjt Bro. have been
carrying on a, commission' business at
309 California street for about a year
and a half. Formerly they were both
in the employ of Catton, Bell & Co.
W. F. Clark left that concern In
March. 1903. E. C. Clark,- the brother
in the .partnership,- jsevered his con
nection, a month or so earlier.' Â¦ "When
"W." F. Clark -started in business for
himself â¢ Catton, Bell & Co. claimed
that he owed them $7681 40; On the
other hand, Clark made a claim that
money was due him from the .firm;
Francis J. Heney represented Catton.
Bell & Co, and George H. Perry rep
resented . Clark. . . . :

SELBY TRYING
HIS OWN CASE
L The B.oard of Education must, restore
; Laura- T. Fowler to her position as a
" principal fn the public schools. An order
.to this effect' was made yesterday
morning by Superior Jiidge Hebbard,
who ha* had her application for. a writ
Â¦of mandate under- â¢ submission since
May 19 last. " â¢. ;. r^. ,v.k'>;
. "M.iss Fowler was -granted a teacher's
certificate. in June, '2864,- and continued
:to s.er\;e in" the. school's of this city until
June 39, ' 1S9^, at 'which' time she was
principal of the San Francisco Normal
School,, witii* a salary of $200. a "month.
..The Normal School was "then abolished
by.. the Board of Education," and Miss
Fawler was put on "the "unassigned list
without, pay,"., but her assistant,- Miss
Fitzgerald* was- given" a "prlncipalship,.
and the other Nbfmal .School teachers
were assigned and have been employed
for .the past. five, years. - .'
A position "as .suhstitu'te teacher was
offered: MisS Fowler, but, in the. .Ian- j
gruage' of her -attorney's brief, which
was "eustainesi by the. court, '.'sh"e was
Justified in" declining such, a humiliat
ing and degrading offer." In their brief
Henley &â¢ CosteUo* said: ''The present
board' is npt to- be- held responsible,
morally, for 'this- outrageous treatment:
it is a legacy, from a former board."
They said, too, that boards of educa
tion seem to- be laboring under the de
lusion that to abolis-h a school means
to 'abolish a Â¦ teache;r. "This, white
haired woman,"' they said, "who. has
given all of her.life.to the cause of edu
ca.tlon, was .remove^ and new-found
favorites usurped .the positions which
were hers by legal' right." â¢ .
. It- was held. that -there/was .no ques
tion, oa the grounds of- good, faith, that
the- Board of ..Education had the .right
to abolish the Normal School in I the
interests' of econotny, but it had no
right to drive the plaintiff from the de
partment and deprive her of her salary,
as Jorng as. there were other positions in
the department which she was well
fitted" to fill. â¢ ' â¢ â¢ â¢ .

firm, which has been' heavily short, has
bought from 30,000 to 40,000 bags of Llmas
there at $4 03. and . that another short house
has bought 25,000 around $464 02%. This
description, nevertheless, is quoted easy at
the recent decline. The other descriptions
are still quiet with large receipts, mostly
damp. The damp Beans continue to sell for
what they will bring, some wet Pinks going;
as low as. $1. as frequently mentioned of late. .
It is the expectation that when these damp
Beans are all sold off out of the way the
market will 4Â° better again. At present they
seriously hamper business. Receipts yesterday
were U720 bags, making 13.83O sacks thus far
this week. - The stock in regular warehouse

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
- Trade in Potatoes continued Â¦ quiet and. as
! the daily receipts of river Burbanks are* too
; heavy for the market to absorb, stocks are
accumulating - right along and the market is
very weak. There are very few Potatoes being
shipped out of the State from this market.
No fresh Sweets arrived and oM stock. whiciJ
was plentiful, was selling at lower prices.
Onions were firm.' with some dealers asking
an advance for the best Australian Browns.
Tomatoes were in increased supply and it
was difficult to obtain the top quotation even
for the very best stock. The market was
j still glutted with String and Wax Beans and
the canners took a portion of the surplus at
the inside quotation. The other vegetables
were in good request and steady. -

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.

CHICAGO. Â¦, Not.;. I.'â Renewed apprehension
concerning the - status of ' the '. Anglo- Russian
controversy caused a sharp rally in wheat here
to-<iay. -At the close December, wheat was l^i
Cl% c higher and May l%c. Corn Is. up a
Â¦hade. Oats snowed a gain of Uc. Provision!*
are practically unchanged. - . .
- -.:- Sentiment in the wheat pit was bullish j frcm
the start. : At the opening the market was in*
ftuenced by the strength of foreign grain mar
kets, the price of wheat at Liverpool being up
nearly - %e following . the decline 1 here yester
day..' The ptrength abroad , was said to b<s due
in . part , to unfavorable ; weather cendi tlons in
Argentina. The domestic situation was k re
garded as qnlte favorable by the Â¦ bull leaders
In the â¢ North westÂ»_where â¢ receipts 1 were ' quite

favorable factor* in the market." By midday.,
however, the market had taken alarm at the
belligerent look of the naval and military
preparations reported from Gibraltar and ea^*
in the afternoon had forced declines of 1 ta 3S
from last ni$Jit on St. Paul. The difficulty
about interprettng th* foreign situation wai
reflected again in the substantial rally which
eet sn before the close. It must be said that
the lack of clear understanding of the hap
peninjs at Gibraltar displayed in New York,
said to bÂ« shared to a large extent in Â£Â«>ndon,
and the deprecatory tone adopted by official
authorities toward any sentiment of alarm
over the outlook was a factor during the cov r
ering of shorts, which caused the rany, hÂ«re.
The three great industrial stocksâ United States
Steel preferred. Sugar and Amalgamated Cop

The suspicion, that Mrs. Grace Squire,
arrested ' on Monday afternoon on a
charge of burglary at 123. Taylor street,
was not a novice in the business .was
partly confirmed yesterday afternoon.
What gave rise to the suspicion was
the large quantity ' of Jewelry which
she carried In a leather bag...
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Charles
Oldag,- 1291 Turk street, called at police
headquarters and was taken to the
property clerk's office where the jewel
ry found" upon Mrs. Squire was** kept.
It was shown to her and she at once
picked out a diamond ring, stick pin
and diamond sunburst as her property.
They were stolen fro'm her apartments
on October 20. Strange to say about
$200 worth of jewelry that was in the
same box with the ring and pin was
not taken. Mrs. Oldag will swear to a
complaint charging. Mrs. Squire with
burglary. ' â¢ '
irtrs. Willetts of the Hotel Neth
erlands also called and identified a
handkerchief as her property. It
was stolen from her in the Emporium
on October 9, with a purse containing
two 550 bills and a gold watch.. Two
$50 bills were among the money found
upon Mrs. Squire, but. Mrs. Willetts
could not swear they belonged to her.
Neither of the watches found on Mrs.
Squire was identified by '. Mrs. Wil
letts. Other women who. have lost Jew
elry will be asked to call at head
quarters.
Mrs. Squire's husband has a mine
about eight 'Â¦ miles from Downieville.
The family has lived there for years,
but nothing has been heard against
Mrs. Squire's reputation while living
there. Detective Bainbridge had a con
versation with her yesterday morning
and he "confesses that she is a puzzle
to him, Â¦ notwithstanding his long ex
perience with criminals. ;
Mrs. Squire appeared in Police Judge
Cabaniss'. court yesterday ." morning on
the charge; of burglary for entering the
room of Mrs. Verlle Campbell," 123 Turk
street, on Monday afternoon. . The case
was continued \ till Saturday and s she

ENTIRELY SANE
The Merchants' Association has de
clined to change Its dinner programme
at the behest of Mayor Schmitz. The
Mayor asked that .he be allowed to
have an official representative among
the speakers of the evening who would
defend the municipal administration
from, anticipated attack. The direc
tors of the association decline to ac
cede to his request in the following
letter sent to his Honor' yesterday:;",
October 31. 1901.
Hon. Eugene E. Bchmitz.
Mayor City and County of San Francisco,
City Hallâ
Dear Sir: Tour letter of the 29th inst. has
been submitted to the board ot directors and
carefully considered:
Your communication -would seem to Imply
that "the announcement of our. annual dinner"
and "the programme of addresses scheduled
for the occasion" are .equivalent 'to an "open
dwlaratlon" of. a proposed attack upon "the
present municipal administration of San Fran
cisco." -We see no apparent grounds for this
assumption and would beg respectfully to say
that if the announcement of the annual din
ner, with It* subject. "The Citizen's Duty- at
the Polls," and the "programme of addresses
scheduled for the occasion," are felt by you to
be necessarily an attack against "the present
municipal administration of San Francisco,"
we are filled with sincere regret.. The speeches
â¢ of the evening are to deal with the citizen's
duty to State arid city." what a good citizen
can do in the way of practical politics and the
experiences cf a citizen at the primary elec
tion". â¢ " *
It has frequently been charged and admitted
that many merchants and other citizens inter
est't-d in good government do not take as active
an interest in .primary .and general elections
an they should, and that this condlton of af
faire is largely responsible for many abuses oc
curlng on these occasions. \
The purpos* of the programme at this dinner
is to awaken a greater interest among our
members and to Inform them, through speak
ers whose experience qualifies them to do so,
what txiey can do to aid good government at
primary and general elections, and how to do
it. No right-minded citizen questions the de
sirability cf this, and there can be no debate
on guch a Bubject. _ " :.
As t hÂ«- arrangements for the evening are
completed,', and the epeakers already provided
will take up all the time available, the board
does not feel that any change can be made in
tJ-.e programme. Respectfully,
THE MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION OP SAN

- : CORROBORATE TESTIMONY
Given Sixty Days' lay-Off for Allow
ing: the Coos Bay to Strike â¢ .
Bottom.
,The license as pilot master held by
Captain M. C. Johnson of the steam
ship Coos Bay was suspended for
sixty days yesterday by Captains O.
F. Bolles and John K. Bulger, United
States local inspectors of. steam ves
sels. The Coos; Bay struck bottom
near Cayucos, California, on October
23: .The findings of thÂ« inspectors are
as follows: . -
After . a careful consideration * of the evi
dence we find that Captain M. C. Johnson was
negligent and unskillful In navigating: the
steamer Coos Boy . on October 23, In that Â¦ ho
did not use proper precautions In approach-,
Ing the port of Cayucoa before daylight, which
is difficult and dangerous, aa there are sunken
rocks there which show only when the wa
breaks beavHy. and In relying entirely on the
sound of thÂ« bell buoy to locate the position
of the ateamer, especially as there was u
strong northeast wind blowing, which would
have a tendency to maker more uncertain the
direction and distance of the bell buoy from
the steamer. Had he used his lead, stopped
the vessel a safe distance off and waited for
daylight he -could have entered the port safely.
CAPTAIN* JOHNSON* MUST
â¢ TAKE ENFORCED VACATION"
in the causes decided bythÂ« departments of
th% Supreme Court. The experience of many
years has shown that petitions for rehearing
In this court are filed In somewhat lesa than
one-third of the cases decided, and that they
are granted in about one case in twenty. The
unanimous decision of a district court will
carry no less weight and command no less
respect than the decision of a department of
the Supreme Court, and If so there will be
as few applications for review and as few
granted: that Is to . say. a rehearing would
b e granted In about one case In twenty, and
those no doubt would be cases of general In-*
terest to the people of the whole State. . .
Other objections, so far as I have observed,
are less substantial than the two which I
have found time to consider. " Â¦Â¦â¢
. In concluding this hasty and laadequate dis
cussion of a question so important I feel war
ranted in stating that it is not only my opin
ion but the firm conviction of each of my as
sociates that the amendment In question is
wisely framed, is necessary, and deserves the
support of I the people , of the State. I hope
sincerely that they will manifest their ap
preciation of your efforts to provide a remedy
for a crying evil by votlnit for Its ratification.
I remain, yours respectfully.

NO CHAMPION
FOR THE MAYOR
Â¦'.The" 'cause of sickness among one
hundred, girls at the golden Jubilee cel
ebration of the Sisters of the Presenta
tion Convent on October '18 last was
found yesterday to be due to poisoned
icecream supplied by a local firm for
the' banquet.
: .Two samples of the icecream, an
alyzed under chemical and bacteriolog
ical tests by City Chemist A. C. Bothe
and City Bacteriologist Frederick C.
Canney, showed that the Icecream con
tained putrefactive germs and a bacil
lus, besides crystals, which were iden
tified as tyro-toxicon poison.
; On the morning of the Jubilee celebra
tion a pontifical high mass was cele
brated at St. Francis . Church, the
Archbishop preaching the sermon.
After services 200 guests repaired to the
convent, where a dinner was served.
After partaking of the pink icecream
half the guests were stricken- Many
Â¦were 6ent to the St. Mary's Hospital,
iothers to their homes In carriages,
a score remained at the convent
and were attended by physicians hur
riedly. called. Â¦ . 'Â¦
Fortunately there were no fatal re
sults,' although many are sick even to
this day. The report on the icecream
Avas sent to the Sisters by Deputy
Health Officer I>evj', who said the
Board of Health had taken additional
eaihples, and in the event the icecream
Bb'Qwed the' presence of germs the
â¢whole plant would be condemned. The
Sisters will take no action against the
firm, as they believe that the. poisoning
"ivas wholly accidental.
Upon receiving this report Deputy
Health. Officer Levy sent inspectors to
various icecream parlors for samples,
arid the .chemical laboratory Is" working
\vith a view to discovering whether
their icecream is fit to. eat. The
trouble was caused by the firm's not
6tenlizing its cans. with boiling water
alter using. Inspectors Are now cau
tioning owners of Icecream parlors to
Fterilize. their cans and to use the ut
most care in. making icecream.

communication t -requested * Chief
Justice's views on* theV question,. which,
it says, is of grave : public importance,
with a*. view to furnistirjinformation to
voters \uot conversant with the meas
ure.
In reply Chief Justice Beatty sent
the following letter:," ._, ','Â¦'â¢:; [Â£*
SAN, FRANCISCO,'; October 31, 1904.
"W. S. Goodfellow. Chairman of Committee, San
Francisco ' Bar Associationâ -" "
Dear Strain" complying- with your request
for an expression of j my . views regarding the
proposed amendment to the constitution estab
lishing District Courts of Appeal I cannot with
the time at my "disposal enter into details, but
must content myself â¢ with a general statement
of the reasons .why, . in my opinion, the people
of the State would act as wisely in adopting the
present amendment as they diet' in rejecting the
amendment "proposed four years ago.
: j The necesai ly of providing tri bunals for the
enforcement of private rights and the redress
of private . wrongs as well as for the punish
ment of ' public . offenses is universally recog
nized." It , Is perhaps â¢ not so : generally recog
nized that' Justice delayed Is In many Instances
Justice denied In .the case of -the private liti
gant, and that undue' delay in criminal pro
ceedings'Impairs the efficacy of penal legisla
tion," but those who have the bust opportunities
of observing know that such is the fact.
, Assuming, then, that . few desire (what - no
one has proposed) to abolish 'the' tight of ap
peal in those classes of cases, Â¦ civil and crimi
nal, in which appeals have been allowed ever
since the first establishment of our-State gov
ernment,and: recognizing the fact that until
some radical j and utterly Improbable change la
made In.'. our, fundamental law, appeals will
continue to be taken with the effect of holding
in suspense' the. rights of private parties, and
the - punishment of .wrongdoers, until they can
be. finally disposed of, it is a matter of grave
concern that the Supreme Court of the State
has been for years steadily falling behind with
Its work until . now an . ordinary civil cause
cannot' be heard, - much less decided, until
more than two years after .the record has been
sent up. The preference ' given to certain
classes of casesâ criminal. ; probate, election
and eminent domain â only makes matters
worse for the. others, and if the court did not
feel constrained in j the exercise of Its discre
tion I to make special orders advancing . the
hearing of cases uf- peculiar hardship the In
evitable, delay- would result In an absolute fail
ure of Justice. "Appeals to this discretion are,
however, a r precarious 'and lnMifflcent remedy
for. a growing evil even aa things are, and as
they are. progressing must soon cease to afford
adequate, relief. â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦: â¢ . Â¦ â¢
So far as I have I observed this unfortunate
condition of- the business of the court has not
been, attributed to any lack of industry- on the
j>art of the Justice*, and yet from the first
organization of . the present court- they have
never been able,' unassisted, to keep its dock
ets clear/ . It .was in 18S5 that the assistance
of three . Commissioners was found - necessary,
and not ' long \ afterward = this Â¦ number T was ln
creaed to Â¦ttve.- . For a. time, with their help,
the court made â¢ some' gains upon I its arrears
and if the business had not largely Increased
It* might at least have f kept even.
But its business has increased in full
proportion to - the ' gTowth and â¢ develop
ment of -the: State, not only In the number_pf
appeals and original . proceedings, | but In the'
complexity, and difficulty of the questions pre
sented for solution. 'This is especially true of
the large and Increasing class of cases arising
out i of disputed water rights. . The result Is as
above stated that we are now more than two
years behindhand, and new cases are coming
in faster than the old ones can be decided."
~ It is asserted â with ' how â¢ much ' truth I do
not know â but- It seems not Improbable, that
â¢one treat evil resulting- from this unfortunate
condition is that It encourages appeals for no
purpose except for â¢Â¦ the consequent delay and
the opportunity 'of fo'reing â¢ the compromise of
Just claims 1 by litigants who cannot afford to
wait. In criminal cases there ia no doubt that
appeals are often taken for delay and as little
dcuht that such appeals are a source of heavy
exiK-nse to the counties of the State " besides
the added expense indirectly â¢ resulting- from
the impaired efficiency of punishment long de
layed as ~ a means of deterring others from the
commission Â¦ of offenses Involving the like pen
alties. â¢
So much for the evils of the situation. That
the proposed amendment if adopted would af
ford an adequate remedy I have little doubt.
It Is now about twelve- years that 'these mat
ters have been under discussion, and various
plans for . relief have been thoroughly consid
ered. " To every plan suggested there have been
objections more or less substantial or plausi
ble. The - plan proposed four years ago and
defeated by the people wan, in my opinion,
open to, grave objection, and the voters of the
Stato were well advised In refusing: to ratify
H. * The present plan j avoids those objactlons
and. is recommended by experience of the suc
cessful. working of substantially the same
amendment to the Federal system, and to the
constitutions of some of our .sister States. It
is undoubtedly the best plan so far suggested
that has the least chance of success either In
the legislature or before the people, and if
defeated leaves the situation hopeless of -relief.
,, The objection .that it involves some Increase
of "expense is an. objection which applies with
ec.ual force to every scheme ever proposed â
except the plan of . limiting: the right of ap
peal, which has thus far. met ;wltlrno favor.
But this ( objection is exaggerated. The ad
ditional outlay might easily be kept within
160,000 per annum; and this 'would be largely
compensated by. the diminished expense to th>
counties "in criminal prosecutions. But If there
vrere no-such compensation, the speedy ending
â¢or private , controversies would be well worth
the entire cost. - Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦ :
/The further .objection that litigation would
be . protracted by Â¦â¢ second - appeals fronl ' the
district courts' to the Supreme Court is,' I be
lif ve. , illusory, i No" doubt there' win be pe
titions for . rehearing: - in the : Supreme Court
after decision I by. the district courts, but there
is no reason I to suppose -that such | rehearlngs
will ! be . allowed in . any larger proportion than
