Ernest â¢ Harrub; 608% ' Minna" street, a

'3:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon. The
crime .was deliberately, planned .and
executed. The shots were fired while

Grauffel's grocery, 297 Fell street.
Tobelmann has had murder in his
heart for some time. About two months

Hickory avenue,, but because' he would
not work or contribute to the support
of his wife and three children, aged,
respectively, 2, '4 and 7 years', Mrs. To

Speaking of the next campaign, Sim
mons said that the Repulicans already
had in effect named as their Presi
dential candidate the present occupant
of the "White House. He described. the
President as "a man of spectacular pro
pensities,' rash, hard-headed arid impul
sive;, a man believed by thousands, aye,
by millions, including many in the Re
publican party, to be by nature and
temperament unfitted ' for the" office of
President because, he was dangerous to
be.' intrusted with supreme* power."'
Simmons admitted that there are now
Beveridge wanted Simmons to.ad
mit that all the corruption discovered
had centered in Machen, but Simmons
would only say that he-had no infor
mation on the subject except that sup
plied by Bristow. He charged that
the effort had been ma"de to divert at
tentfon from the department, buf said
that the -Republican party need not
build any hopes on success in that di
rection, for despite such efforts the
postoffice" frauds would be an issue In
the next campaign..':;?' .. :
"So far as Machen Is concerned,"
the North Carolina Senator replied,
"Bristow says that is true." ' :7;
Beveridge asked if Simmons would
not concede "that the source of the
fountainhead qf the corruption dis
covered had been found in the last
Democratic administration?"
. In response to questions from. Bever
idge, Simmons said that he did not
doubt that if crime wasÂ«brpught to the
immediate. attention of the President
he would disapprove of it. He did
not concede, however, that the Presi
dent had done any more than his duty,
and he repeated his charge that an in
vestigation by Congress had been re
fused only because of the fear of the
disagreeable developments.
Notwithstanding there had been
thirty-three Indictments as a result of
the Brlstow report, only two of the
fifteen Government employes indicted
had been tried- arid it was now pro*

issui-: ix ni;xt campaign.
Simmons said the reason the in
quiry had not been extended to the
entire Postoffice' Department was
found in "the fear that such a con
dition of things would be discovered
as would make necessary an inquiry
into the affairs of the entire executive
departments in Washington and that
such an Investigation might uncover a
condition that would cause the defeat
of Ihe Republican party in the Presi
dential election."
Simmons declared that the investi
gation into the affairs of the Postoffice
Department had .been limited, to only
one branch of the department and said
that "wherever graft was looked for,
there graft was found;, wherever crime
was looked for, there crime was found;
wherever swindling and corruption was
looked for, there swindling and cor
ruption was found."
If all this had been found in one
branch of the department there was
no right to assume that similar con
ditions would not be found to exist in
other branches. Hence there could
be no justification for a denial of an
inquiry by Congress. â¢

Mallory then addressed the Senate
on the Carmack resolution instructing
the Committee on Judiciary to make
inquiry into the legal right of the Sec
retary of the Interior to issue the old
age disability pension order recently
promulgated. He said the only point at
issuÂ« was whether the legislative
branch of the Government had- not
transcended its authority and usurped"
functions not its own in establishing
the rule by the new order. He con
tended that such usurpation had oc
"curredf, and argued that this order was
not in line with -the order given by
General Lochren during Cleveland's
administration. He acknowledged^
however, that Lochren had transcended
the law in fixing seventy-five years as
evidence of total disability.

Patterson introduced a bill for the
amendment of the Chinese exclusion

tion that the Chinese Government had
denounced the treaty Â¦ between that
Government and the United States
and the treaty would expire December
7 next. Unless the law shopld be ex
tended Chinese could come into the

devoted to consideration of the

The Call is informed that Judge Par
ker's friends are more than ever con
vinced that the peculiar nature of the
present national situation requires the
adoption of instructions by- the State
convention in language that can ad
mit of no doubt. They have practically
canvassed the entire Democratic sen
timent in Congress from the Atlantic to
the Pacific and have learned from this
canvass that the demand is practically
unanimous that New York shall in
struct in favor of some candidate and
bind its delegates so that there shall
be no'question about how the Empire
State stands. - ' * /
The- consensus of opinion Is that if
New '.York instructs the contest Be
tween the radical and the conservative
ends of the party will all be over within
three weeks thereafter or before, the
middle of May, and that easy control
of the convention for Judge Parker will
have been assured.
.On the other hand,, if New York
should refrain from instructing and
merely pass complimentary resolutions
which would still leave the delegates
free to vote for any man for whom the
convention might be stampeded the
contest would go on up to the very
meeting oÂ£ the convention. -always with
a chance of a mistake being made and
a weak ticket nominated. Thus thf*
demand for instructions does not come
from. Judge Parker's friends in New
York, but from the Democracy at large.
The argument that Tammany had
made against the instructions and in
favor; of a compromise Is, of 'course/
largely prompted by a desire to avoid
humiliation for Charles F. Murphy, 'the
Tammany leader.
Perry Belmont of New York, who
has been here for several -days, quietly
meeting his old friends in Congress, is
of ;the- opinion that the State conven
tion will instruct for Parker by a lar^e
majority. The popular demand fur
Parker is in reality but a cloak to- rid
the .party of Bryan and Hearst, for if
New York State, which the Hearst
party represents, in Congress, should
indorse another New York man his own
candidacy would be made ridiculous.
WASHINGTON, April iâTam
many Hall's offer to compromise with
the Parker forces In the New York
State convention by passing a resolu
tion of indorsement. Instead of a
resolution of instruction under the
unit, rule, is understood to In
volve a resolution . reading ; some
what- like this: "Resolved, That
'we commend to the Democrats of the
country â¢ for their consideration the
name of Hon. Alton B. Parker,, pre
siding: Judge .of the highest" tribunal
of this State, whose -abilities are ad
mitted by all, whose, character is un
assailable, and whose Democracy i3
above' reproach and criticism, and
whose, record in public office has al
ways been marked by conservatism,
dignity and honor."
The resolution has been outlined to
fri^rvdH of Judgr-- Parker another, have
b'een "'asked to accept It in Ijeu qf a
resolution .which, -while commending
the Judge in some' such- terms,. would
add a clause instructing the delegates
from the State of New York to vote
for him as a "unit in the St. Louis con
vention.

THINKS IT A FIERCE SPORT.
Both the.'young women and Whittell
were unconscious when they were res
cued from; their dangerous jj position.
Neither Whittell nor Otts was quite
positive concerning the .exact cause of
the upsetting of the machine. , Otts
said: . Â¦â¢: ,': . . " ' '
. "I -was tooting - the < 'horn -while we
were running out the road- at a rapid

soon as I could gather myself together
I hustled around to see what was do
ing. The machine lay bottom up and
underneath it was Whittell and one of
the girls.. We didn't^ lose any time
about rescuing them.
Miss Henry, Otts and the chauffeur
were thrown' out. while Whittell and
Miss Day were caught under the over
turned machine. The women in' the
buggy were hurled into the middle of
the road, but they managed to crawl
away from the wreckage and' were
given speedy assistance by the crew
and passengers of a Haywards electric

tell and his guests returned 1 to this
city.
The r>arty left Oakland last evening
bound for Haywards, where they had
intended tp dine and then return to
San Francisco. It was at 8 o'clock
when the accident occurred. Whittell
was sending the big machine along the
smooth, level road at a lively clip, the
chauffeur directing the owner's han
dling of it. On the inside sat Otts,' who
was blowing the mobile horn. Â¦
Opposite Hawley avenue, near the
Moss Tract, the Â¦ Neill' bug-gy suddenly
loomed up in front of the rapidly mov
ing automobile. Before Whittell had a
chance to avert the collision the auto
mobile crashed into the buggy. Whit
tell-gave a turn to the wheel lever just
as the two vehicles came together arftl
over weafthe automobile.
George Whittell Jr., son of , a local
millionaire, a party of friends and Â£>vo

last night in an automobile accident
on the San Leandro road. Whittell,
who was driving, his $12,000. machine,

Colonel Younghusband, commanding

Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India, which
confirm the statement concerning the
engagement between the British and
Tibetans hpar Guru yesterday. The dis
patches add that it was the Lassa
general who fired the first shot, there
by inciting the Tibetans to attack, and
show , that but .for the fact that the

It was stated at Mr.. Kruttschnkt's
office yesterday that -no decision has
; yet been arrived at as to who will be
â¢named as President Harrrman's per
sonal representative in this city. Here
"tofore'Mr. Kruttschnitt, as vice pres
ident -and' assistant to the president,
acted for President Harriman; in all
matters, of importance. .In the circular
announcing the appointment of Charles
H. Markhamas general manager. o.f the
Pacific system, ho mention is made of
apy other. titles conferred on him.. It
is the general understanding, however,
that the newly-appointed general man
agers" of the Harriman lines, are soon
to be given the .titles of -.vice presidents
of their respective corporations and
that Mr. Kruttschnitt will retain the
.title of assistant to the president of; the
Southern Pacific in addition to' his
other title # of director of transporta
tion of the Harr'iman lines.
Harriman purposes to become presi
dent of .everything in the way of rail
roads tha.t he controls and with his
directors of traffic, transportation and
purchases'and supplies, Messrs* Stubbs,
kruttschnitt and : Thorne^.and his chief
auditor, Erastu's Young, lie has planned
=to operate . aH his lines under , a" fixed
policy. ' Â¦' ,-
A, L. Mohler entered upon his duties
as general manager of- the Union Pa
cific Company, with jurisdiction over
the lines east of -Green River, and W.
H. Bancroft turned his attention to the
duties of general manager of. the Union
Pacific- system west of the latter point
and. that portion of the Southern Pa
cific east of Reno, which has- been as
signed to his territory, as well as the
lines of the Oregon Short Line. , : -
E. E. Calvin, formerly assistant gen
eral manager of the Oregon Short \Llne,
also took up his work as general man
ager of the Oregon Railroad and Navi
gation Company." and the Southern Pa
cific Company's lines in Oregon.
On the 'Atlantic system of the South
ern- Pacific Company, over - which
.Markhanv will â¢ have no jurisdiction,
there were several changes in the con
sistent rearrangement of the'operating
.departments of the Harriman lines.
Thornwell Fay 'was promoted from the.
position of. .general superintendent of
the ' Southern Pacific, with headquar
ters in New Orleans', to that of gen
eral rkanager of the Atlantic system,
with headquarters hereafter in Hous
ton, and his. old position w.as filled by
W. E."O\ven. formerly general superin

â¢now have his headquarters in New Or
leans.' ! ,'\ :>-:

The many changes In the operating
and traffic departments of the Harri
man lines, announced during the last
few days, became effective yes'terday.
a fact that was most noticeable about
the Southern Pacific . building. Short
ly after, the offices of the company
opened for "business yesterday morn
ing, a circular dated Chicago, April 1,
and bearing the signature of the new
ly appointed director of transportation,
Julius Kruttschnitt; "approved by E.
H. Harriman, president," was posted
at the entrance of each railroad de
partment,- formally announcing the ap
pointment of Charles H. Markhamto
the position of general manager of the
Pacific system of the Southern Pacific
Company." It was' this circular that
deeply impressed the minds of the rail-:
road officials that hereafter the affairs
of the company will practically be di
rected from , the offices, of , the Harri
man cabinet . in Chicago. E. O. Me-
Cormick, who was- yesterday succeed
ed by Charles S. Fee as passenger
traffic manager of the Southern Pacific
Company, also assumed his new title
as assistant director .of traffic of the
Harriman lines, although he will con
tinue to direct the affairs of his old"
office until . Fee arrives to-morrow.
Later in the. day messages received
from other portions of the road showed
by their signatures that changes else
where had taken place as previously
scheduled.
"park .improvement bonds," which was
incurred pn April i, 1874, for the car
rying "out of improvements in Golden
Gate Park. They were to run for thirty
years,- and consequently fell due on
April" 1, 1904* which was yesterday. The
pew bonded issue of $17,700,000 cannot
be. considered a debt until the Supreme
Colin _ passes on its legality and the is
sue is purchased.
City . Treasurer McDougald and his
â¢force of deputies were busy all day re
deeming â¢ the bo-nds, which were pre
sented by the holders thereof, most of
whom, were the commercial banks.
Quite, a number of the *onds had the
last Interest coupon attached, but
most of them contained the certificate
alone which Â¦ entitled the holder to the
payment of $1000 as the face value of
each bond. They have been bearing
interest at th.e rate of 6 per cent per
annum. The sum paid out on the bonds
by.' the Treasurer aggregated nearly
$150,000, and the remainder will be paid
out . to-day. .
â¢ The present budget set a'side the sum
of $15,000 for the interest account of the
..bond issue and $10,000 for the sinking
fund: . On February 1 last there stood
to- the credit of the sinking fund *the
sum of $250,917 98, or $317 9S more than
the amount required to redeem the
bonds. When the second installment
of taxes is paid the approximate' sum
of $4000 will be transferred to the fund,
which Trill result in a surplus of nearly
J5000, that may be> : app!ied to other "pur
poses of improvement after it . is put
into the general fund on July 1*. 1904.

The Deseret News this, afternoon pub-,
lished that as soon as legal obstacles
ca'n be removed that part of the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad running from
Reno, New,;, to. Sacramento, Cal., tC-tll
come under the operating
of W. H. Bancroft as part of the Ore

the main line of the Union Pacific from
Green River. Wyo.. to Corinne, Utah,
and the Central Pacific from Corinrie.
to Reno. The News' information is to
the effect, that the legal departments
of- both roads are now. working on the
.prpblem. by which, so far .as the act

for it threatens none. It stands for peace, lib
erty and Justice to "all. Â¦ Indeed It Is not too
much to 6ay that the cause. of humanity Itself
depends upon the blood loyalty of. the Anglo-
Saxon race, for It is- with that race God has
intrusted the "irk of his covenant unto, -the
sons of men.- . . ' .
The British American Union held Its
regular meeting, last night at the Ac*d-.
erriy of Sciences , Hall. Dr.. Fred W.
d'Evelyn presided, and a programme of
music and song was contributed by
Miss Etta Welsh. Miss Louisa Smith,
Edgar Bayliss, Q, J. Williams and Pro
fessor Robson. The American and Eng
lish flags, which covered the . back
ground of the platform, were
in crape,- attribute to the memory of
'th-e late Mrs. Mary R. Hew'itt, who was
president of the. Ladles' Auxiliary of
the union, and who # dled March 18.
The of the meeting was an
address by John McNaught, manager
of The Call, on the subject, "Blood is
Thicker Than Water." iHe spoke in
part as follows: -... '..,â¢Â¦-'
''â¢ 3IUST HAVE UNITY.
This is " a = world . of Incessant " strife and
eodeavor, where.no race nor family can stand
at all unless the membÂ»rs of: it stand "all for
one'and one- for all." -.The history of mankind
has been a history, of woe to every race whose
members have not felt, or have. not been loyal
to the ties of .blood kinship. .Of Ruch faces It
may be said-, their, blood was thinner than
water, and they have either long since perished
utterly, or else been reduced, to servitude and
absorbed by "races, whose men have known how
to act like brothers^Jn. mutual, defense against
any. foe -that threatened even the' weakest of
them. :
At the time' when Tatnall uttered :hls fa
mous saying, "Bood is thicker, than water," It
could have been' spoken of several ' other races
far, more- accurately than of the Anglo-Saxon;
for at that time there was â¢ comparatively lit
tle- popular- sympathy â¢ between the -people of
the British' islands and the people of the
United States. The traditions â¢ and hlsiorles
of .both couritries were largely -made up of
wars, and of the prejudices,- hatreds and an
tagonisms, growing out of those wars. On
the other hand, while the Anglo-Saxon race
was thus dominated by mutual jealounies of one
kind or another, there was developing among
certain European races, and particularly
among the Italians and* the Germans, a spirit
of racial sympathy destined to profoundly af
lect the- whole -European political system.
â¢ It. wan the vigor of this race sentiment that
made the: success- of Â¦â¢ Bismarck -and Cavour
possible. , i;nitÂ«-tl Italy and united Germany
stend as proofs that â¢ blood Is ! thicker than
water, that.it is indeed so potent that when
it begins tn throb in the 'hearts of the valiant
and the loyal no power on earth can stand
against it. â¢ - ' ' 1 / -**â¢
SLAVS ARE MOVING.
; The impulse of: that spirit is to-day more
potent than" ever,' because it is more widely
and;, more acutely, felt. , It is . the chief cause
of the disturbances in the Austrian empire
and in Southeastern. Europe, because the peo
ples of the various rare*, inhabiting those
countries â¢ -are continually planning, plotting
.and striving -to find- some means of effecting
a .racial . unity through the establishment of
a.'aelf-goyernln; nation.. .
Â¦ The most momentous of these various race
movements is that which Is stirring in the
minds and in the hearts' of the Slavs. It
is already manifest that out of the movement
toward Pan-Slavism â¢ there is to come tha
grea.t story 'of ' this century, for the stirring
of the Slav means as much to' the world to
day as the stirring. of the. ; Gennan Â«nd the
Italian meant to Ihe Eurol>* of. fifty, years
ago. It promises to be one of tne most mar
velous stories of all the ages, but at the
Â¦ame time it threatens to be ' qne of the
most dangerous. â¢ * â¢ . ,
, It la then something more than a sentl
mrntal ' consideration which at this time Is
drawing so many of the â¢ leading minds of
every branch of the great Ensllsh-spÂ«aklng
race Into a 'closer and closer' correspondence
one with another- tn an effort to â¢ revive tha
ancient kinship and , brotherhood of the rare.
Should the blood of the Anglo-SaxorfÂ»race ever
btcome .thinner than water the future of the
world would be Russian or Chinese. A great
race has built up a great empire from the
northern to the southern sÂ»as; it has settled
its children in all ' the vast unoccupied lands
of the Americas and the Australia?; It has
/established peace through Just governments:
It has -Riven, to the poorest and the ' weakest
a degree of protection to life and property
never knowrj before. .
rOTKNTIALlTY IS WONDERFUL.
; In the accomplishment of all these mighty
work-s .from the days of Magna Charta down
to our time the Anglo-Saxon race in all its
branches' and in all it* widespread dominions
has -crown rich, .prosperous and proud. At
present, if ; if were united, ' nothing could, suc
cessfully assail- it'. â¢ A vast power is within
its hands; an opportunity Immense await* th*
right exercise of that Â¦ power. "There is' to
me," eaid Cecil . Rhodes, "something, almost
awful In thÂ«j. thought that if a few strong men
at Washington and at Westminster could
agree it would be possible even now; to estab
lish throughout the world an Anglo-Saxon
peace which' no nation would dare- break."
! We , may .not agree fully with those wonjs
Of the great- South African dreamer, but even
the least sanguine can hardly doubt that if a
genuine blood loyalty- grew up. among -the
men of. our race there- would then be a power
sufficient to guard civilization actiinst any
threatening darters from the banded barba
rians, despotisms and superstitions of earth. .
'â¢ That blood loj'alty which Is bo essential to
our race In ' the â¢ approaching ntniggle' for su
premacy, we â¢ may reasonably believe, will -be
attained in the near future. The old antag
onisms that kept the American and the Brit
ish branches of the race- more or less hostile
to one- another are passim? away. A thou

Captain Scott, with another party,
made two excursions westward in Oc
tober over a glacier. They gained the
summit â¢ October 11 and â¢ crossed the
magnetic meridian October 20 in longi
tude 155%-- east. Proceeding still west
ward the party reached a point 270
miles' from the ship, in latitude 73
south, longitude 146% east. The in
terior of South' Victoria is evidently a
vast continental plateau. The glacier
valley affords 1 magnificent scenery and
gives a natural geological section of
the mountain's. ' - "Â«*;?;
"In the middle of December the party
attempted to cut a canal through the
ice, which . was frozerf fromJsev,en to
eight-feet thick, but the effort was
futile, owing to constant refreezing and
the party desisted. The open water
was then seventeen miles, from the

LYTTLETON, New Zealand, April 1.
â The British Antartic steamer Dis
covery and the relief steamers Morning
and Terranova arrived here to-day.
â¢ The relief ships, which left Hobart
December 5, reached the Discovery
February 14 and found all the members
of the expedition in excellent health
and spirits. Scientific work was con
tinued by the explorers throughout the
winter of 1903. â¢ They . established the
fact" that; the" Interior, of Victorialand
continues at a' height of- 9000 feet and
is evidently a vast continental plateau.
A hew route west was found, and a
depot was established 2000 feet up the
glacier.
Captain R. F.- Scott, R. N., of the
Discovery says the winter of 1903 passed
pleasantly and that the members 'of
the ! expedition enjoyed much greater
comfort than In 1902. Sledging opera
tions began in September, under severe
conditions, owing to extremely low
temperature, which frequently fell to
60 decrees below zero. In November
one party reached a point -160 geo
graphical â¢ miles southeast of the ship.
There was no trace of land and evi
dence was obtained " showing that this
was a vast floating ice plain.

INCOHERENT STORY.
As. a- matter of fact, v Mrs. Mitchell
does v tcll, 4 a, ;very, coherent : story.
One; moment she' says one" thing .-'"and
the next moment' she either^ contradicts
it 6rj refuses; to talk at ; all., She; even
denied the^ relationship with, the' child
and V. mother. \. at ' one time I this *' after-'
nbonV Â¦ .;;; :;'>-' .
*Â¦-. t'My, dau ghter <Jid .'not ' get the worn-
Mrs. Â¦Loscum-Groth was rather dis
inclined to tell her mother all. Her
feelings were so wrought up.y however,
that she was brought to tears and a
realization of the - enormity, of her
thoughtlessness.. She was so affected
that she came to Berkeley tojnquire
of some people^ named Cheney for the
name 'of j the strange woman. It seems
that the stranger had given a Mrs.
Mary Cheney of Berkeley as one of her
references. ! .
Nothing came of this quest, how
ever, and the mother and 'grandmother
have made no real attempt' to,flnd : the
child. - A Mrs. * Loscum was not at the
address. given by her mother in Oak
land to-day. In fact ..her mother was
not very sure ; as to the whereabouts
of her daughter. She gave several ad
dresses to '.the' inquirers,' the most* like
ly one -being a room 'in the" Playter
Block in Oakland," but. all attempts to
find the ' woman ;f ailed; She probably
has disappeared since last night; for
yesterday she was working.at' 2117 Ade
line Oakland. Â»"
One.'of- the. strange features^ of the
case" is thatythe^ child,- Evelyn, had
been with i ; her i v grandmother,/ several
months' before the grandparent knew
that , she,; was her grandchild. ' Mrs.
Mitchell had advertised {to -\ take : : care
of; a child - and ,- her 'own , daughter ' had
answered the - advertisement. -In the
transaction - that accompanied the ex
change of the. child .the motherland
daughter were unknown to each" other.'
Mrs. ; Mitchell^ confessed this in her
house this *Â¦ afternoon : : and "could give
ho explanation of her daughter's 'con
duct.' : â¢ ) Â¦-'
SEARCHES FOR STRAXGER.
The labyrinth of mystery that sur
rounds the , dI sappearance of little
Evelyn Loscum, . the ..two-year-old
child whose mother gave her* away to
a strange woman, was ' not straight
ened out by the persistent inquiry
that was made to-day into the case.'
Complications turn up with every new
link to the story and it is no nearer
solution than it was yesterday. â¢
The mother of the child is a tailoress,
who works in Oakland. She has as
sumed her maiden name, Lillle Groth,
though she uses it with' the prefix of
Mrs, Instead* of Miss. This is the out
come of an unfortunate marriage with
Edouard Loscum, now a Nome miner.
Mrs. Loscum's mother, Mrs. > R.^B.
Mitchell, told two different stories
about this unhappy affair to-day. One
is that her daughter married Loscum
when she was under age and the other
that? she discovered that Loscum al
ready had a 'wife when he married
Miss Groth, who Is 20 years old. At
any rate, an annulment of the mar
riage -\yas secured.
Mrs. Mitchell's story about the child
is' that her daughter came to visit her
lasf Tuesday in company with a
strange woman; The mother and
strange woman took the child with
.them for' what, was presumed a short
walk. In a little while the mother re
turned to the Mitchell home at 1620
Idaho street, Golden Gate, but alone.
Upon being aske'd for the child, the
mother said, she had given it to the
strange woman. She confessed, - too,
that she had not taken her address or
name. Â¦ )->;.'

The other . speakers . were . the Rev.

to the advocacy of 2, Christian life. and
Mr.' Phelan to t"he student in politics.
You are not strangers to Idealism. You bare
perfect gentlemen in every American city and
your idealism is cound and solid. It makes
life worth living here.
If. Is the . general .Impression In Europe- that
In the United- States the dollar reigns su

predominant. I do not now hold -that view
and -can refute the Impression when I return

Dr. Eduard Meyer, the great German
historian, is rather' more pleased with
America and Americans since he has
seen them close at hand than he was
when he got his impressions from read
ing about them in books and newspa
pers in his own native land.' Ameri
cans are not the worshipers at the
shrine ofÂ«the almighty dollar that he
had always fancied and there is a real
intellectual and spiritual breath in the
atmosphere of their country. .All this
and a great deal more he said this
morning from the platform in Harmon
gymnasium while addressing a thou
sand students of the University o-f Cali
fornia. Here are some of the things
Dr. Meyer said:
In my vlÂ»lt to this country I was most im
pressed by the energy of the men who consti
tute its citizenship. I had not the time to
consider everything, but my attention was at
tracted to thig one thing. It is but fifty
years since the Argonauts came to the racltlc
Coast and lew than forty years filnce the first
railroad was built here, yet there is here a
great civilization. This entire movement was
a great conquest for civilization. <
When I went to Chcago I saw a great city
erected on what wag once a waste of country,
and as I crossed the Â¦ continent I passed In
numerable cities springing out of this vast
area. If I could come In forty years from
now I am sure I would not recognize the same
territory. "Where there are- now forests and
deserts there will be great cities, giving a
livelihood to millions.

OF THE CALL IN
ALAMEDA COUNTYSirs. . McClungr Sick and Destitute.
Attorney 'W. D. Grady, who repre
sents Alexander B. Garnett, charged
with the murder of Major J. W. Mc-
Clung in Mrs. Elizabeth Hitchcock-
Coit's rooms in the Palace Hotel, filed
an affidavit in Judge Lawlor's court
yesterday that the_ widow, Mrs. Mc-
Clung, was sick and destitute in San
Diego>and would be unable to attend
the trial of the case. He therefore
asked that an order be made that she
be examined conditionally before the
County Clerk at San* Diego or other
fit and proper person. The matter was
continued till this morning. .
Somethins New.
The San Francigpo "New* Letter" for this
week is on sale at afl news dealers on Friday.*
to have been with John A. Benson.
Here was a loophole for Hyde and Di
mond.
"Do you know Frederick A. Hyde or"
Henry P. Dimond?"
"No, sir.'
"Ever exchange a word of conversa
tion or correspondence with them, or
either of them, on any subject?"
"No, sir."
"That is all."
DEFENSE WIXS A POINT.
"Are you acquainted with John A.
Benson?" asked. Heney in cross-exam
ination.
"We object," shouted McEnerney.
"This witness was not asked anything
about Benson."
'"Objection sustained," the Commis
sioner ruled.
Then came Woodford D. Harlan,
former chief of the special service di
vision of the 'and office, and, as such,
charged with the protection of public
domain from fraudulent entry and
timber trespass. In that responsible
poBt, the indictment declares, he re
ceh'ed divers sums of money for fur
thering the schemes of the alleged land
sharks. But his acquaintance and
dealings had been with Benson, at
Washington, and he, too, was . a
stranger to both Hyde and Dimond.
â¢ "Do you know John A. Benson?"
Heney repeated, with the result of
drawing out the same objection from
McEnerney and the same ruling from
Heacock. So Harlan gave place to
William E. Valk.
Valk is. the principal examiner in the
General Land Office, where he has been
employed since he was a boy. The sum
of $1000, the indictment says, found Its
way into his pockets from Benson's, as
consideration for valuable information
furnished and other illegal services
rendered to the combine. Valk was a
more fertile witness than his prede
cessors. He did not know Hyde, but he
had ha;t doings with Dimond, and
therefore had to be handled carefully.
McEnerney. soon got through with him
and then turned him over to Samuel
K right, on*Â» of Dimond's attorneys.
VALK y4XD DIMOXD.
"Mr. Valk, do you know the defend
ant, Henry P. Dimond?" Knight asked.
'Yes, I met him at Washington,
where we were introduced by mutual
friends in the General Land Office."
McEnerney stopped the proceedings
long enough to get a final objection on
the record, excepting his client, Hyde,
from the effect of any testimony by
Valk. Heney argued that, as both
Hyde and Diraond were Indicted for
the same conspiracy, the objection was
not well 'taken.
"When there is proof of a con
spiracy." Commissioner Heacock said,
"then the act; of any codefendant is
material evidence against all the de
fendants. I shall overrule the objection.
The weight I shall glye the testimony
wil! be considered later."
Under Knight's careful questioning,
Valk told the Commissioner that within
a day or two. after his introduction to
Dimond he . met the latter outside the
iand office, where Dimond had : given
him a card; 'or note, from Benson.
Valk's story was in substance as fol
lows'if&flj
"Dimond said he was in Washington
to expedite certain land cases and that
he would prepare a list and try to get
favorable action taken. on them by. the
Land Office. ' He* wanted , me to. take
an interest in these cases and assist
J written by him in furtherance of the
! alleged conspiracy.
McEnerney then began a long and
persistent effort to get in evidence the
abstracts of title on file in the General
Land Office for the hundreds of small
parcels of # land included in the tracts
! covered by the thirty-four counts of
th<? indictment. These, if admitted
without protest, would tend to show
that the titles offered the Government
were regular instead of fraudulent, as
the Government claims. Fimple' would
be asked to identify an abstract cover
ing one small section of a vast tract
, and when he had done so the attor
ney would present it as a fractional
proof that his client, Hyde, was gross
ly maligned by Uncle Sam. Quick as
a shot would come the objection from
Government Counsel Heney- that an
abstract was no proof of title.
"We have no objection." said Heney,
I '"to your offering the abstract to show
the representations made by Hyde in
order to obtain the selection, but not
cs proof that the State of Oregon con
veyed the land to A. S. Baldwin." .
"We offer it." McEnerney retorted,
"as the best possible proof that Ore
j gron conveyed to Baldwin. Baldwin to
Hyde and Hyde to the United States."
UcEXERNEV WONT TELL.
"It is not the best evidence," Heney
argued. "The deeds are what you
want. An abstract is only presump
tive evidence of the facts recited and
the deed may contain many stipula
tions that were binding on Baldwin,
but do not appear in the abstract.
Where are the deeds?"
*"We won't Xell you," McEnerney an-
s-wered coolly. â¢â¢ .*!
Finally the Commissioner got a
chance to rule. "An abstract of title
is wholly insufficient to prove the con
tents of a conveyance," he said. "Your
abstracts may be admitted as proof of
their own contents, but no more. The
Government's objection is sustained."
Blocked on this line of attack, Mc-
Enerney next took in hand Marvin M.
McLean, a clerk from the land office,
who has been deputized by the Land
Commissioner as custodian of the
voluminous records sent out here for
the examination. All that McLean
yielded was the information that his
papers did not contain the deeds cover
ing any of the relinqulshments by
Hyde for his lieu selections, and that
many of the abstracts were also miss
ing:, having been filed in other selec
tions by the same defendant â selec
tions that are not included in the In
dictment but are covered by .the same
abstracts. These documents were still
at Washington filed away with the
papers relating to the other cases. Mc-
Lean was excused.
"Call J. Knox Corbett,*" said McEner
ney. but the Tucson Postmaster not
being at hand Grant I. Tagrgart was
sworn. Taggart, .who is 74 years old
and who used to be a well-to-do citizen
of Oakland, has for several years been
employed by the Government as a su
pervisor of forest reserves. In this ca
pacity the indictment says he fell a
victim to the cash of the alleged land
grabbers, to whom . he furnished ', ad
vance information of the lands selected
for withdrawal for the purpose of cre
ating - reservations 'and at whose' In
stance he recommended the inclusion in
such reserves of lands in. which they
were interested. But It was on none
of these topics that McEnerney. ques
tioned him. All his dealings are said
â¢Â¦. The contest of legal strategists in the
â¢g^i eai;' . laiid fraud hearing has become
A.gkrr.g Â«f prima facie cases, in which

.The only noteworthy addition to the
public's stock of information came from
Â¦Willlanx "E.. Vaik, principal examiner in
the General- Land Office at Washing
ton,* vtho 'is* alleged- .to have been in
Benson's pay, and who yesterday let
out the facjt that the defendant Dimond
rame to him wJth a jiote of intro
duction from Benson, saying: 'This
man 1 Dimond represents me and he is
all right." Just why. the defendants
Hyde and Dimond. who are alone in
volved* in this rroceeding. should have
brought out thJs fact is uncertain. One
of the Government's representatives,
however, declared last evening that it
was evidence of the fact that Benson
&r.H Hyde have parted company In their
defense to the Indictment in which they
are "-Jointly accused and that each of
thÂ«m 4s_ looking but solely for his own
Interests.
John H. Fimple, the Assistant Com
missioner of ther General Land office
at Washington, was questioned at
length by McEnerney as to the meth
ods in vogne there in expediting lieu
land selections and also regarding the
duties of subordinates who are here
Â«s witnesses tor the Government.
Fimple said that approximately 10.000
selections were on file in the depart
ment under the forest reserve act of
1897, and that these covered more
than â¬3.000,000 acres, which the se
lectors were seeking to substitute for
their holdings in fifty-seven forest re
terves scattered all over the WesL
Many of these Â» electors appeared by
their attorneys, he continued, and the
tppearances were made by letter simi

him in getting them passed. He told
me that he had an understanding with
Benson and Hyde. This conversation
took place on F street, Washington,
near the General Lana Office, in the
fall of 1900 or 1901. That's as near
as I can place it. Dimond began it
by presenting a card or note from;
Benscn to me, showing that he was
sent to Washington in the interest of
Benson. Hyde, C. W. Clarke, Elizabeth
Dimond and so on.".
AX IMPORTANT NOTE.
"Can you produce that card , or
note?" Knight asked.
"No. Of course it would not do for
me to have such a communication on
my person and I destroyed if at "once,
if I remember correctly. I know I did
not keep it more than ten minutes at
the most. No;. Benson's name was not
signed to the thing. He wouldn't do
that. It was Just signed 'B,' I think.

writing as well as the- letter signed
to it."
In answer to further questions Valk
said the note from Benson did not ask
him to use any improper influence, nor
had Dimond ever made such a request.
Dimond had simply said that he was
there In the Interest of., certain lieu
land selections and wanted me to aid
in expediting them. No, I never had
any correspondence with him and
never received 'any. money or offer of
money from him."
On cross-examination Valk said that
the communication from Benson was
in substance as follows;- "This man
Dimond represents me and he is all
right."
"At that time you had some rela
tions with Benson, ' had you not?"
asked Heney.
"We object," interrupted McEner
ney. The Commissioner gave the at
torney until Monday to present a brief
sustaining his objection and the wit
ness was excused until them. The
hearing , will be resumed at 10:30
O'clock Monday morning.

The Filipino scouts were .the cen
ter of attraction at the Presidio yes
terday. Their drill started at 3 o'clock,
and long before that time the towns
folk commenced to .assemble. They
perched themselves on the terminus
platform of .the railroad company and
on every available point of vantage
and by the time the scouts came down
from their camp on the hillside about
4000 people were in attendance. ; ,\- -
In the drill proper the scouts were
in khaki uniforms. They went through
the different evolutions and maneuvers
evidently to the great satisfaction of
the crowd, which, repeatedly cheered
and applauded them.- Following the
drjll the splendid band gave a concert.
At 5 o'clock came the full dress pa
rade. For this important ceremony the
Filipinos donned their brand new blue
uniforms and marched and strutted
about as proud as peacocks.
The parade was reviewed by Lieuten
ant .Wait C. Johnson, who took com
mand, in the absence of Major Carring
ton, who- had gone to the city to pay
his respects to General Shatter.
The parade passed off in first class
shape, and in the drill of the manual
of arms the scouts made a tremendous
hit' and earned the hearty applause that
was given them by the spectators.
There will not be any drills to-day
nor to-morrow, but the scouts will be
on the field again every day next week
at 3 o'clock for drill and 5 o'clock for
parade.
The last orders Carrington re
ceived," commanding him to take his
scouts to St. Louis and then retrace his
steps to the Philippines, are causing
expressions of regret from* all the offi
cers in his command. Lieutenant John
son, in speaking of the order yesterday,
said: "We are greatly disappointed
that Major. Carrington has been ordered
to leave us on arrival at St. Louis. We
are all, both officers and scouts, great
ly attached to him. He has worked
hard and long to bring the scouts to
their present degree of efficiency, as
you see by the work they are doing
here. Major : Carrington is a soldier
and a thorough disciplinarian and
takes a tremendous pride in his pres
ent command. We are all sorry to lose
him. We still hope the order may be
revoked, and that he will be able to re
main in command during the time of
the exposition."
The transport Logan sailed for Ma
nila at 12 noon yesterday. She car
ried a big load of freight and 275 re
cruits, who were in command of Major
H. H. Benham, First Lieutenants A.
Mclntyre and J. G. Langdon and Sec
ond Lieutenants C. E. Hathaway and
J. V. Kuznik.
The little brig Lurline, bound from
Altata. Mexico, for Grays Harbor, put
into rort late yesterday afternoon with
the second mate, Fred Romer, in irons.
Rom'er became violently insane three
days ago, when the ship was about
seventy miles west of San Francisco.
Seizing a large iron belaying pin Romer
attempted to kill the captain. The two
struggled on the deck, but Captain
Forest was no match in strength for
Romer, who is six feet tall and im
mensely powerful.
Had it not been for the timely assist
ance of the first mate and some of the
crew murder might have been done.
Romer was overpowered with difficulty
and placed in irons and the brig head
ed for this port.
.Romer was brought ashore last night
in a launch and removed by the local
police from Powell street wharf to the
insane ward at the Receiving Hospital.
The demented sailor's wrists were ter
ribly swollen through his constant ef
fort to throw off the irons. He has but
one eye.

inexplicable as the initial dreadful lie, saved the cityfrom

one juror in this case has since reflected that not even in

for one ever to know whether he is right or wrong.

Josh Hutchlnson, who for thirty
five . years has been head bellboy at
the Gait House, is down and out from
a physical ailment, says the ; Louis
ville Herald. He is the most 'original
character among the Louisville bell
boys, and was in the hotel on the day
that Colonel Throckmorton had his
famous set-to with Charles Dickens.
Dickens was writing in his room and
Colonel Throckmorton, a courtly
Southern gentleman, thought he
would go to the room, and see if he
could not assist in giving Dickens all
the comforts of the hotel.
The landlord went to the room' of
the great writer and knocked at the
door.
"Come in!" said Dickens gruffly.
Looking up. he saw Throckmorton.
"Well, what do you want?" he
asked gruffly, for he had his English
ideas about' the standing of an inn
keeper. ' .
"I thought I would ask you if -there
was anything I could-Â«o for you." .
''No! not a dân thing!" Dickens
answered, churlishly," not looking up
from his writing. '<]}*'Â¦?*
Colonel Throckmorton was growing
heated about the collar at this time.
However, t he thought he had been mis
understood and again asked Dickens
if there was anything he could do for
him. Â¦/';,'';:Â£
"No. Didn't you hear me?" an
swered Dickens, growing excited and
gazing at the landlord as if he were a
bellboy. "If there is anything I want
I'll ring for it. You can go."
That was enough. Colonel .Tferock
morton walked quickly over to Dick
ens, grasped liis coat collar and pulled
him out of the chair. Dickens' man
uscript fell all over the floor and the
Ink spattered on the carpet. He. was
game, however, and the men fought
all over the room.

IN its special Easter edition to-morrow the Sunday
Call will present some of the best work ever exe
cuted in modern journalism, both from an artistic
and a literary point of view. There will be sixteen pages
of carefully selected and timely features.
Among the beautiful art features, for instance, there
is a magnificent full-page photograph of one of the
most attractive children in San Francisco singing an
Easter anthem amid a bower of St. Joseph lilies. There
is something so peculiarly reverential in both the" pose
and expression that this picture is sure to find its way
into a permanent setting in many homes. It is entitled
"Easter Morn."
Still another attractive full-page photograph is a re
markable snapjshot secured at St. Mary's Cathedral just
at the time when the fashionable congregation were leav
ing the church. It is one of the best group pictures ever
presented in a modern paper. â¢ .
Not to be overlooked in the attractions dear to
the feminine heart is the full-page picture of the dainty
"Easter Miss," attired in the prettiest and latest crea
tions in the modiste's art.
Almost equally important arc the full page of photo
graphs of the newest and most stunning Easter hats
shown hi the center of fashion and wealth â Paris, and
a page of the "Floral Fancies of the Easter Girl." This
last mentioned page is sure to prove exceptionally pop
ular in a land overflowing With rare blooms as is Cali
fornia, and yet it is a strange circumstance that few
know how or where to select flowers for Easter decora
tion or m how to^rrange them after they have been se
lected. . This page shows many new and appropriate
jdeas.
Perhaps dearer than all will be. the page devoted to
the Easter bride â what she is wearing, what she should
wear, and all the dainty and" fascinating frills and ful
belows without which no fashionable wedding can lay
claim to pretentiousness. The photograph tha.t illus
trates this article is ,of one of the most beautiful and
attractive of the brides of the season. It will be a sur
prise even to those who know her. ' ."].'
Most appropriate will be the Eastern sermon by .the
Rev. Louis J. Sawyer, pastor of. the Hamilton-square
Baptist Church, on "The Resurrection Pledge." This is
a splendid forensic effort, artistically illustrated by two
famous panels representing angels painted by Old World
masters.
In the line of pure fiction there is the last installment
of "To-morrow's Tangle," by Geraldine Bonner. This
last installment is by far the strongest and most exciting
of the whole book, which, next to "The. Octopus," is
perhaps the best novel ever written of California life.
In quite a different vein is the fourth of Albert Son
nichsen's Deep Sea Vagabond stories entitled "When
the Don Adolpho Turned Turtle," while the new Puzzle'
Page for the children and the Scrap Book Page with all
its unique features and the page of Timely Topics of the
World for men and women and children "alike, make up
one of the most entertaining special. numbers ever issued
by the Sunday Call.
In addition to all this and much more besides might
be mentioned the beautiful, art supplement, which will
be given away free with "the Sunday Call to-morrow
njorning / entitled "An Easter Offering," which is de
signed especially for framing. .

The burning agony of death
When darkened earth with trembling:

Beheld, her young Redeemer bleed?

The perfume of the-martyr's palm,

Ascended o'er the Sinless slain.
The April breeze was on His brow.
And spicy fern and flowering bough
Poured sweetly for the smitten King
The scented sacrament of spring.
O hearts that felt His human wound.
Your sorrow groped on- desert pround, .
Your faith, astray in piteous loss.

Its foliage stirred with whispered. prayer.
The primrose knew His bed was there,
The myrtle kissed the mourners' feet

For Him who walked the rosy lanes,
A soul too mighty for ijts chains.

Hath made our flower of sacrifice
A life beyond the life that dies.
Kach fiery pang His pity heals.
And every patient grief reveals .
The silver shining through the dross, "

Szveets for Children.
Nearly all children, especially if
they be normal, healthy children,'
crave for sweets. A great many
parents, without any thought or rea
son in the matter, deny to their chil
dren all kinds of sweets. They do this
from some preconceived notion that
sugar and c.andy and cakes are bad
for the children. Other parents go to
the opposite extreme and indulge their
children in all sorts of -confectionery,
from the' cheapest to the most expen
sive, allowing them to cat- rich, in
digestible cakes, jams, candled fruits,
preserves, etc.
They both are making & mistake.
Children should be allowed to eat
sweets â but the proper kind of
sweets. Cheap, nasty confectionery
should never be given them, neither
should they be permitted to have too
much jam nor any of that indefinable
hodgepodge of stuff that masquerades'
under the name of cake. Beware of
cheap, painted candies; they are
poisonous. . .
.' But give the children sweets In the
form of pure chocolates, honey and
syrup made from fruits. A lump of
sugar or a stick of good candy now
and then will not hurt them. Let
them eat molasses, but be sure, it is a
good quality. Fruit Jellies, if unadul
terated, and plain cookies that are not
too sweet are good for children.
Let the children have sweets. The
system craves them. They impart
warmth and energy. They nourish
and build up the tissues. The best
time to give the children sweets. is at
meal times. Let fruits. Jelly, syrup,
molasses, honey or cookies form paf t
of each meal and then children will
not so often plead for candy and cake.
Let the children have sweets. But see
to it that they, are furnished' the
proper kind, at the right time and in a
sensible quantity. â Medical Talk.

Old Steamer Days.
A party of gentlemen were discuss-
I ing in the corridor of the Palace the
peculiarities of different people in the
manner of conducting business In dif
ferent parts of the world. "One thing
that struck me as peculiar when I was
in Victoria, B. C., a few we^ks since,"
said' one, "was the fact that during the
noon hour one canno_t make any pur
chases in the stores. Every business
man closes at the lunch hour to par
take of the noonday meal."
"That reminds me," said one of the
listeners, a gray-haired California
pioneer, "of San Francisco when we
were thirty, days away from home in
the East, from parents, wives and
children. That is when it took thirty
days to get a letter from. home. This
was before the days of ocean grey
hounds, pony express or telegraph. It
was when the mails came by way of
the Isthmu3 of Panama and were car
ried on board of the old sidewheel
steamers. When a sidewheeler was
sighted at the outer. station the long,
black arms on the Telegraph Hill sta
tion would be put In position and it
was always about two hours before the
steamer would come to an anchorage.
That signal was for several years a
signal to Ignore business. If- a cus
tomer who had not noticed the signal
entered a. store to" make a purchase he
would be told, 'Come in later; haven't
got time to do any business; steamer's,
coming in.' The intending customer
lost interest In what he visited the
store for and became engrossed with
the topic of the hour, wondering if he
would get a letter' from home. The
thought of receiving news from the
dear ones at' home after a silence of
thirty days unfitted all the old San
Franciscans for business on those oc
casions."
been beating ; the representatives of the English news
papers as well as those. of the American press is not
a matter which can be laid against the door of the
Japanese Government; rather should the disgruntled
newspaper managers look closer at home to find the
cause of their defeat. The success of the Call-Herald
news gatherers" calls attention to the qualities which
niake a successful war correspondent. In every cam
paign the personal influence and the address of each
correspondent counts for his success in gaining the
confidence and goodwill of the staff officers with -whom
he is connected far more than a widely heralded fame
as a "forceful" writer or a "self-assertive and pugnacious
author of books, turned war eagle for the nonce. It
is the man % who can win â¢ recognition from the' army
officers with whom he is associated purely upon the
merits of his own address and' the evidences of his
capability and integrity who will' win preferment over
the heads of his fellow craftsmen in the great game.
Oscar King Davis, who heads the Call-Herald staff
of correspondents in the East, is such a one. Many
years' experience in the difficult task which he fills and
a record of past achievements have given him the power
to make a successful bid for the favor of. the Japanese
generals, and by this favor he has been, enabled to direct
his movements and those of his assistants into field
which lias remained closed to the rest of the army of
war scribes. Up" to date Mr. Davis has supplied The Call
with a large budget of exclusive news of the hostilities,
and it is safe to say his successes will continue to be
made manifest in the pages of this paper as long as
the war lasts.

A DISPATCH from London announces the 'fact

come out of that district within : the last few weeks has
been sent by the representatives of these self-same two
papers. We take not a little pride in announcing that
these two papers happen to be the New York Herald

The London Daily Telegraph, in its issue of the 31st,
commenting editorially upon" the fact that the Call-Her

Chenampho and Pingyahg, makes the plaint that "the
other special correspondents and even the military at
"taches at Tokio have" bedn told that they cannot be
allowed to go to the front and must continue for another
indefinite period to cool their heels in the island capital."
The Daily Mail mourns the fact that "the Japanese press
censorship is rapidiy- tightening. It now extends beyond
military movements . and even includes references to
local disturbances. vThis censorship, applies to private
letters in addition. to telegrams. The Japanese authori
ties are striving to prevent news and messages leaving

IT is evident that the political fortunes of Judge
Parker have . been placed in the hands ; of David
B. Hill. This is .fortunate for Judge Parker as
long as his fight is within the party, leading up to
the nomination. Beyond that point the scene shifts.
Mr. Hill got his political training under Tweed. He'
was a sub-lieutenant under that Tammany" chieftain,
who knew him as "Little Dave," and used him in the
Legislature in that series of acts which led to the #
comple'te control of New York City by Tweed, and to
looting it in the sum of $29,000,000.
When Tweed was brought to an account by Tilden,
Hill went into retirement and let his chief take his
medicine. He -was resurrected as Lieutenant Governor,
became Governor and then Senator. In the Senate,
during Mr. Cleveland's second term, he led in all that
demoralizing opposition to the President which finally
took his party away from his leadership. Hill had
begun this course in 1892. He called the celebrated
"Snap Convention," by which he secured, with the
assistance of Tammany, a delegation to the National
Convention pledged against Cleveland and led by
Bourke Cockran. In the Senate he put all of his sub
tlety into breaking Cleveland's power. He opposed
his nominations and opened the way to the final attack
under the leadership of Bryan, which overthrew Mr.
Cleveland completely, and so demoralized the party
that its moral weakness has made it receptive to the
influence of Hearst.
No one knows what Mr. Hill's ulterior plans are: He
has grafted upon the pn.rty a series of strange issues,
and an administration influenced by him \v6\1ld repre
sent every wild and hairy plan that would win a few
votes, no matter what the effect upon the country.
There is reason for believing that Hill really feared
the reappearance of his old enemy, Cleveland. To pre
vent this, he has encouraged the anti-Cleveland senti
ment among the up-State Democracy of New York to
an extent that seems to have made him master of a
situation in which he can dictate to Tammany.
It is natural, therefore, that Tammany should treat
with him by agreeing to support, Parker. No Demo
cratic candidate has found favor at the polls when
supported by Tammany. Tammany opposed and fought
Tilden, and he had a popular majority. It fought
Cleveland in 1884 and he was elected. It supported him
in 1888 and he was beaten. With Hill's help it fought
him in 1802 and he was elected. Tammany supported
Bryan twice, and he was beaten. The Democracy of
the country do not- take kindly to the ways^of Tam
many and look with aversion upon a Tammany national
administration at Washington.
Mr. Hill's power to assimilate any issue that* seems
to have votes behind it was shown in his adoption, in
the State platform of 1902, of the extreme theories of
socialism. The anthracite coal strike had focused
public attention upon the coal supply. The coal opera
tors were helpless and unable to meet the demand for
fuel because their control of their property was sus
pended by a force they could not resist. People were
not making particular inquiry into the cause of the
coal shortage. They wanted coal. That " situation
offered to. Mr. Hill a chance to influence an existing
public opinion and perhaps catch some votes. He took
advantage, of it bymaking a joint bid, that appealed to
the socialists and td the necessities of people who
were not socialists.
He made it by putting, in the State platform an
expropriation plank, raising the monstrous doctrine
that when the owner of property affected by public
use is unable to operate it because of a force that he
cannot resist' the right of expropriation arises and the
State may take his property from him and operate it
as a public enterprise! This plan opens the way to
immediate government ownership and control of all
property. It disclosed the peculiar order of Mr. Hill's
*mind. The condition which would give the right of
expropriation was caused by unlawful acts and he
assumed that a lawful public right can arise in acts that
are unlawful, the victim of those acts being the sufferer,
and therefore the party selected for punishment.
This country has been made familiar with a variety
of governmental theories. As long as they are only
in the breath of tlfose who dream of them no one
cares to give them careful examination. But when a
leader like Hill plants among the principles of his party
a scheme for the universal overthrow of private owner
ship of "property attention is compelled. Judge Parker
is put^ forward as a conservative. But his campaign is
made by Hill. It is lik? putting George Fox in the
hands of Suwarrow and insisting that the Quaker
opposes war and rapine. The task Mr. Hill has on hand
is to make the socialists and capitalists believe* he is
with them both. But he has two eyes and can wink
at both sides.
Sierra to the sea," in the current
phrase. '
' San Francisco does not figure as an
exhibitor of mineral products of its
own, as might be easily surmised, al
though in the annual reports of the
State Mineralogist this city is credited
with mining a considerable quantity of
rubble every year. The city offices of
men connected with mining interests
have contributed aragonite, ground
yellow ocher. crude yellow qcher,.pow
der, slate, calmanite and ' onyx, and
manufacturers of mining machinery
have al3o contributed to make up the
characteristic California mining show.
The State Mining Bureau draws on its
exhibit in the ferry building for the St.
Louis Ex:>osltion to some extent. The
State Mineralogist also has provided
a large number of photographs illustra
tive of mining in California, the result
being very good and comprehensive as
regards all phases of mining.
Attention is called to the fact that
gold ores ure contributed by nearly
every one of the counties* mentioned In
the foregoing.
Gems are contributed by San Diego
County and Sonoma County, garnets
by both. Asbestos comes from Sierra
County, having been mineS In the vi
cinity of Mountain House. Cinnabar
goes to St. Louis frem several coun
ties.
Thj following recapitulation shows to
each county the mineral substances,
apart from petroleum and mineral wa
ters, that have been contributed for St.
Louis:

The gold and some other minerals are
in several shapesâ in ores, gravels, etc.
The aim in the foregoing has been o.nly
to mention the different minerals.* The
purely mineral exhibit of California
will weigh about fifteen tons. The min
erals and structural materials fill four
freight cars. Three carloads have been
started. The mineral arch to stand at
the entrance* of the California mineral
exhibit will weigh eighteen tons. It
will be composed of building stones do
nated by^ individuals and corporations
in all parts of California.
State Mineralogist Aubury Is now in
EL Louis. He has gone to Install the
exhibits and to superintend the erec
tion of the arch. He will remain away
until this wort is completed, possibly
for two months.
The mineral exhibits, together with
all other articles from California in
tended for dispJUy at St. Louis, have
been shipped by the California Com
missioners, and the exhibits remain
ing in the State are In charge of their
representatives in this city and iri Los
Angeles.
How California will compare as an
exhibitor of minerals cannot be told
until the. other large mining States
have made their Installations. As there
is almost a blocks.de at St. Louis now
on account of the innishing of all sorts
of exhibition material. It may not be
possible within a month to estimate
what sort of a competition California
miners have set up.

Carl Lehmann of 1437 Pin* ijreet
called at the Coroner's office yester
day and requested that an inquest be
held on the body of his son Carl, 18
years old, to determine whether death
had been- caused by the negligence of
EdwaFd Sullan.
Young Lehmann went duck hunting
with Sullan \ near the Six-Mile House
on the night of December 5; 1903, and
was /shot through the rjght leg by

charge, of Sullan's shotgun, both men
being in a flight- skiff and setting out

Central Emergency. Hospital and
thence to the German -Hospital, wher^
he died at 3;10 o'clock 'on the afterr
noon. of December. 6, thfe shooting hav
ing occurred about midnight of the 5th.
On the day following his sonfs death
Mr. Lehmann called at the Coroner's
office with Sullan and waived an in
quest, stating that he was convinced
that no blame could be attached to
Sullan. Mr. Lehmann said yesterday
that the wounded boy was allowed to
lie bleeding for two hours In the boat
with a blanket thrown ;over.- him while
Sullan went for help,' and that Sullan
could have summoned Â¦ Mr. Roberts,
whose house was close to the place
where the boat landed, and that his

Of disturbing the peace which had been
filed against Mrs. E. L. Kingman by
E. Harmon.> The complainant averred
that he owned the furniture of his
Mission-street dwelling. In which he
installed the defendant as housekeep
er, he being a single man, and that
when he notified her that he had de
cided to dispense with her services
she hurled bad language at him and
refused to leave the house. The de
â¢fe'ndant declared that her declination
to vacate was prompted by the fact
that tho defendant owed her money,
but this counter charge he stoutly de
nied, asserting that he had pa.id her
every cent that was justly owing- her.

j went to investigate the woman's com
j. plaint thej- were met at th.e door by
j the husband, who flourished a pistol.
In defense of his conduct Johnson
I pleaded that his wife had provoked him
to violence by her wanton behavior. He
is an invalid, he said, and she led an
< immoral life.
i Then the woman, with wrath biazing
in her eyes, told the court why she was
'not a model wife. She stated that after
eiTecting her moral ruin three years
! ago at Portland, Or., Johnson married
! h^r and they came to this city, where
j he insisted that she support him by
sacrificing her womanhood.
Johnson tried to refute the woman's
i statements, but utterly failed to <Jo so.
Then he whiningly attempted to lessen
j the enormity of his conduct by saying
! that he was sick and unable to work.
"The onlj - charge against this man
; -If that of carrying a concealed weapon,
, and I find him guilty," said the Judge
i severely. "In the meantime I would
; like to have the complaining officers
j enter against him an additional charge
i of compelling ihs wife to lead an im
moral life, which is a felony."
Johnson was taken away, to remain
\ in prison until the additional accusa
[ tion can be formally prepared, and the
' woman was also taken into custody to
J be retained to testify in Superior
j Judge Hebbard's court as to the char
! acter of the Dujxmt street house in
I which her husband placed her.

any other for a good many years. The
run -has been especially good in ' San
Lorenzo River and in Scott* and Wad
dell creeks. *To verify my own obser
vations the people who live along these
streams inform me that not -in twenty
years have they seen so many fish as
they have this: winter. When I say
that trout fishing should be: good in
San Lorenzo River; that means it
should be - good in - Bear, | Deer, Kings,
Two Bar, Boulder; and Jameson creeks,
for all these streams are tributaries of
the San. Lorenzo.; These â¢ streams are
all easily Â« reached . from , the .- town of
Boulder Creek, the distance - from the
town to the farthest creek'^belng only
a little over an hour's -walk. A' person
desiring a day's sport cannot miss it if
he fishes either in- Scott or j Waddell
creeks. â¢ When I visited those â¢ streams
three, days ago, i besides Â¦ the eight and
ten pound *nsh I saw . a great number
that would scale, from one-half to two
pounds! The San: Vicente, Soquel and
'Aptos- creeks are also .splendid trout
streams, and thej fisherman that; visits
either Is reasonably sure * of a well
filled creel.".... .'.. .....ââ..
Although the â¢ trout streams of the
coast were thrown open to the anglers
yesterday under' the â¢ State law,,,com
paratively few. fish were, taken. The
Paper Mill Creek, .being the most ac
cessible to the sportsmen of this city,
attracted the usual opening day crowd.
As was expected, the returns were
small, the stream being unusually high
and muddy : If the weather remains
clear the fishing will, be good by the
middle of next. week, but each suc
cessive storm will, defer the day when
good sport will be. assured.
W.. Halstead is credited with having
caught the largest ; flsh yesterdayâa
twelve-inch steelhead.. The majority of
the flsh taken were of small size.-.-VV
The heavy rains -.; of the past: two
months will make this, a late season,
but- when fishing does begin in earnest
great sport is promised. The * high
water has allowed the steelheads ; to
run up higher on I the streams and in
greater numbers than In many years.
It has " also protected the ., fish \ from
poachers and from. the depredations of
larger flsh^
All the coast streams and the lakes
. C. A. Reed, the game warden of San
ta; Cruz County, who is a close ob
server, of the streams of that county,
has; made the following report to the
information bureau of the Southern
Pacific Company:; Â¦: "The run of steel
heads this winter far exceeds . that of
and streams- of the Sierras have been
affected by the late season. It is the
opinion of experts that there I will _ be
no flyfishing on the. coast stream^ un
til May 1. As there is a lot of snow on
the mountains at present the- flyfishing,
will not be good there until early in
June.' The Truckee will not be avail
able for flyfishing until still later.
- Until the big streams settle the only
fishing will be well up the small-tribu
taries, where salmon roe; and angle
worms will Drove the best. lure.
The fishing prospects on the Klamath
River are unusually promising. Rain
bow trout have been going up Shovel
Creek In immense numbers. All the
tributaries of the Klamath are report
ed teeming with trout. '
; The market; fishermen are already at
Independence - Lake and will , fish
through holes cut in the ice.

Stanford; university, April 1.
After three months; of hard practice
and constant coaching, Stanford will
test her baseball team to-morrow
against the University, -of California
in the first of the series of intercolleg
iate games. :' ... . .
For the .first time in several years
Stanford has a .team which Its ad
mirers think ought to .. .defeat thÂ«<
Berkeley nine. Throughout 1 the long
season there have-. been the usual ups
and downs. At times the cardiriala
have played exceptional ball, and
again.they have gone through a series
of dumb ' plays that would, take the
heart out of. any coach; But how tha
team has rounded Into shape. Char
ley Doyle led the \men through . thd
first months, of training and ait his de
parture two weeks ago- "Jini" Lana
gah, last year's football coach,, took
Jiis. place: The change- proved bene
ficial. Besides putting on the flnjshipg
touches that Doyle would have done;
Lanagan has put a determined spfrit
Into, the team, that the .forifter". never,
could have accomplished. _â¢ And. now
Lanagan, sizing up the situation, says "
he does not see why Stanford' should
lose. . ' :'Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦ \': . 'Â¦'.' .'. â¢ â¢Â¦Â¦.'â¢.Â¦ ':'[Â¦ Â¦': -

base. ' Swain played on the -Palo Alto
High School team for several -years. :
He has improved wonderfully on the.
varsity squad, easily beating put all
competitors. First base will be held
down-by Colbert, who played on the
second team last year. He is a fair,
fielder and a good hitter.
In the outfield Wlrt, In center, is
the. only veteran.. He is the best field
er, that has been at Stanford- for sev- ;
eral years. He is also second In the
batting order. - Chalmers will pjay,

school. Sales will. play right field. He
is . substitute; "pitcher and will prob- .
ablyVpitch one of the games, in which
case Knight, a 1902: varsity right
fielder,, will take his place.
See No Reason Why Their Team
Should Not Win the First Gome.
On . the park courts there will be
matches in all four classes." In* the
first class there are four '\ men left In
the upper half and three -in ''the lower.
AiacGavin _wlll * be jout Â« of Ctowa: for - a
The men on whom Stanford will rely
are Hodge, Clem Baker and Nieb.
Harry Wlebe. although still at o&llege,
wilL be unable to play,' as he has al
ready played four years. ' Even- with
a man like Wiebe Stanford has been
unable to win a point, and as Hodge,
his successor,- is hardly, as good, the
Stanford men are not suffering with
overconfidence. Hodge is a clever
young player from Southern California,
but â¢ hardly classes with a : man like
MacGavin. Stanford's chances of'win
ning one of the three points are. poor
and it would not be surprising If Cali
fornia won without the loss of a set.
The Golden Gate and California
clubs have some good matches set for
to-morrow. At â¢ the California Club
courts the finals of the handicap
doubles will be played. Will Allen
and Tracy Crawford will be opposed
to Sidney Salisbury and Frank String
ham. They will meet on even terms
and a great contest will result. Neither
team has won the cups. /Allen . won
them once with Dr. Hill, butthey must
be won three times with the same part
ner.- ' . Â¦'"-.-
. Baker caused quite a surprise during
the week by beating Claude Wayne in
the finals, of the colle'ge championship
tournament. After beating Varielâ
6-1, 6-1â Wayne was expected to beat
Baker handily. The latter's steady
game won him the tournament and a
place on the varsity team.
As us-ual, California has an abun
dance of good players, while Stanford
has only two -or three, and .they are
not first class. .The California repre
sentatives will be the same, as last
year, except that Neil Baker will take
the place of his brother, who graduated
last yea'r, as second man in singles.
As in the last two years, Drummond
MacGavin, the; college champion, j will
be first man in .singles and' will play
in the doubles with Variel.
There Ms but one good court at Stan
ford and as there are' three' matches,
it will take all morning and a part of
the afternoon tft" finish them. The
Stanford court fs a new one and is
first, class. The Palo Alto players have
been practicing hard, but their chances
of winning are anything | but good.
University of California players have
won easily -for the last three, years
and ; ano'ther one-sided contest is an
ticipated.
Now that the rainy season appears
ended, the tennis- players will endeavor
to 'finish their tournaments which have
been- postponed from Sunday to Sun
day, for two months. The California
Club has still a .match to play In the
Washington's Birthday tourney. The
class singles cornmenced at the park
more than a month ago is not nearly
completed.- â¢ .
The event on the tennis . courts this
month wifl Tje the annual intercol
legiate-tournament. This event. has al
ways "been held on the California Club
courts in this city, but this year it is
expected the tournament will be
prayed at Stanford. As usual, the date
will be ihe same as that of the annual
field day, which will be held on the
16th inst.
Smiling Skies Greet at
Last the Experts Disap
pointed- by 3Iany Failures
The players will start by the electric
car leaving the corner of Fifth and
Market streets at 1:45 p. m.
.The ball will be put into play as soon
as practicable . after the arrival of the
footballers at San Mateo. The direc
tors of the league wish to give the
boys of the preparatory school a sam
ple of the game, in the nope that it
may be taken up as an alternative to
the intercollegiate game' by boys who
lack the necessary weight.
Now that all the matches have been
played for the championship of the
California Association Football League,
the Oakland Hornets rank fifth in the
table at results, next below the Aiv
bion Rovers and above the Occidentals
and Pickwicks. Had the Hornets lost
their last match against the Pickwicks
they would have dropped to last- place
on the list. The Hornets' victory last
Sunday by the wide margin of 11 goals
to 0 brought them up to fifth place.
Although their score by points is the
same as the Occidentals' score, their
goal average is better, the Hornets hav
ing had not quite one and a half times
as many goals made against as for
them. The Occidentals have had their
goal pierced three and a half times
as often as they have made goals
against their opponents.
Early in the season the Thistles set
tled on their team and kept it un
changed until the last two weeks of
March, when R.' A. Disher/ playing on
the Idora Park ground, injured his leg
so that he was compelled to retire from
the team in the last two matches. The
Thistles have several good individual
players, the three Dishers in the for
ward line, -Duncan and Taylor In the
halfback line and T.S. Lydon as cen
ter forward. being specially useful.
In the final match for the California
â¢Association Football Union. cup the In
dependents .beat .the Thistles 2 goals
to 1, the winning goal being scored by
the Independents in the last three or
four minutes. The ground was covered
with water and slushy mud and seemed
to suit the I Indenendents better, than
the Thistles. For the Independents the
three Fay brothers rendered invaluable
service. They have been picked to play
for -the; combined eleven' against the
league champions, on April 24 at San
Jose.
The standing .'of the teams for the
season is shown in the table: '
On the ground of St. Matthew's
School, San Mateo, the Thistles, win
ners of the championship of the Cali
fornia Association Football League for
1903-04, will play a friendly match this
afternoon against a team of Oakland

At the annual meeting, ; held last
Saturday night in Lower Lake, Lake
County, the members ,' of â¢ the Burns
Valley Cricket Club unanimously de
cided to maintain the existence of the
club and its affiliation^with, the Cali
fornia Crlfcket Association. T. W:
Beakbane was elected- secretary and
treasurer and H. P. H. Haggitt and G.
R. Webber delegates to the . Calif ornia
Cricket Association. These names ar
rived just in time to be inserted on the
association's 1904 schedule, which is
already In type. :
Although the Burns Valley Cricket
Club still maintains an organization,
the prospects for the game in Lake
County during the coming season are
poor./ The Lakeport Cricket Club has
failed to organize arid, r though- the
Burns Valley players could make up
an eleven, there are no antagonists
agamst'whom they cdh measure their
strength. At various tirnes in the last
ten years there have been cricket clubs
In i Bakersfield, . Los 'Angeles. ' Sacra
mento, San Jose, Shasta County, Lake
port, Placer County and elsewhere,
but, the founders and supporters '- of
the organizations ; having j drifted t away
to other places, the clubs have died.
The only country : clubs now . affiliated
with the Calif orhia ' Cricket Associa
tion are the Burns Valley - and r the
Santa: Cruz clubs.^..' . "
The Pacific Cat Club will hold its
annual show in connection., with the
dogs on the last two days of the show.
Among the exhibitors will be" Mrs. A.
H.' Broad. Mrs.' A. H. Abbott, Mrs. A.

dogs of this breed having been pur
chased during the past year. . : 'Â¦:

championship for 1 90 4 was decided
yesterday on the California. Club
courts. Herbert ;Long, . last 1 year's
champion, successfully defended his
title against his brother, Melville, the
tournament winner. ; Young Long- was
thought to have a poor chance to win,
but his brother Had his hands full
beating him. The match was won in
straight' sets, but all ; three 'were long
deuce ones. .'- '- *"'Â¦'
Herbert Long played a clever game
in all parts of the court.- but particu
larly so in the back court. t His driv
ing, both backhand and Yorehand, was
remarkable for a High School young
ster. The winner took more chances
than he would have done had he not
felt so sure of winning. The scores
were â 7-5/10-8, 8-6. ",:â¢"
The semi-final match between Brad

in an easy victory for the latter. Wal

The question as to whether Eugena
Geary's great greyhound Palo Alto is
to continue * to wear the laurels of
champion, which he has done so grace
fully for several f years, or "whether -it
is to go to the rising young champion.
Pocatelli, will be decided soon.. These'
representative greyhounds will meet
one week from to-morrow in the first
series of trials for the grand, national .
coursing stake.
The victor of . the best three out- ot
five courses will be declared the winner.
..There were' 171 March payments of
$2 50 each in the Mississippi Valley
Futurity of 1904. This exoeeds last
year's stake and practically insures the
biggest coursing event, in point of num
ber of nominations, ever run in
America. There are no California
owners represented, although there are
a number of ' California-bred puppies
among those nominated.
In the Montana Futurity, first pay
ments were made on forty-eight young
sters. This is a creditable showing, con
sidering the scarcity of greyhounds In
the north.

In order to prove that he deserves
their good opinion, Coxbett will do hia
best to put Mowatt down for the full
count within the limit.
I Mowatt Is an impetuous Individual.
Imbued with a certain amount of clev
erness, but trusting principally in his
terrific punching power, he loves a
rally at close quarters and tears after
his opponent, dealing out left., and
right swings in sweetly impartial fash
ion. With two fighters of the slugging
caliber pitted against each other, the
logical deduction is that an early
knockout may be . looked for. This is
just. what Is likely to happen to-mor
row night.
Corbett, who is by no means given to
boasting, still asserts. that there. is no
boxer living at his . weight j* who can
swap punches with him and win a vic
tory. .'Mowatt's stockyards adherents
are so enthusiastic over their repre
sentative's chances that they are freely
wagering their money on the chance of
Tommy staying the limit.
Corbett is favorite in the betting at
odds of 2 to 1.
Officials of the Fort Erie Club are
endeavoring to bring Britt and Young
Corbett together some time in April,
when, the ban is expected to be lifted
on fighting before that, club. Corbett
expressed his willingness to accept any
reasonable offer,* but says he does. not
believe Britt would favor it owing to
the condition of his injured arm. From
advices he has received this will not
be mended for three months.
CHICAGO/ April, l.âTommy^Mowatt,
the | stocky aids' "boxer,^ has one -chance
to-' defeat 1 -Young' Corbett. in . their six
round bout '.to-morrow -night . at the
Waverly.- Club.; .The' chaiice liesjin his
right glove and in. thev hitting .power
that- lurks' in ! the 'samel' Â¦. ''Â¦ ',y. : {

of delivering a blow is his main, and. in
'fact,- almost- only ? hope jof -winning.
According -to reports', from' the'train
ing camps of, both: men they in
splendid condition.. Mowatt has trained
faithfully for the battle,, but Young
Corbett- has- apparently done- but little
hard work, depending a great deal on
his class to win.; The little boxer re
gards the affair .merely as a warming
up gallop.' At, that he is in fair shape
and, barring the possible chance of an
unexpected, knockout swing from Mow
att's wild but convincing right .hand,
the^ Colorado 1 boy : is looked 1 upon as a
sure -winner. 1 - Â¦-Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦-' . -
. Smarting with indignity of: his late
reversal at the hands of Jimmle Britt,
the Denver boxer is not likely to' spare
any pains in his endeavor to stop the
Chicago boy in a hurry. His friends in
Chicago have one and all declared their
belief in the report that hC was, given
the worst of it by. the'refere'e at San
Francisco.
Special Dispatch -, to The- .â¢ Call.
Rowing, with the exception of ,thÂ«
barge races held on the 20th inst. by
the Dolphin Boat Club, has been near
ly at. a standstill for some months.
But,. now that the Ariel Rowing Club's
new house ia ready for occupationiarid
that the South End Club has begun
the construction of its new quarters,
there will be something doing soon.
The Ariel Club hats put in a permanent
float and is ready for business. It has
purchased the eight-oared pleasure
boat Grizzly and a Whitehall from the
Pioneer Rowing Club and will buy
others for. the accommodation of the.
many members who will wish to go
out on" trips as soon as -the weather
becomes, settled.
The Ariel Rowing Club has kept In
terest alive by the formation of a
bowling annex, made up of a dozen or
more members who meet on uptown,
alleys on" Wednesday nights. On Fri
day nights the members are instructed
in swimming by some of the strong
swimmers of the club at the Crystal
Baths. "
- The South End Rowing Club mem
bers expect their house will be ad
vanced enough to afford its members
a good place from, which to view the
launching of the battleship California
next* month. The, situation of .the
house is excellent. Clear, deep water
will afford fine swimming at all times.
W. H. Mead, the president; J. E.
Scully, the captain, and J. P. Foley
have worked particularly hard in the
matter, of getting a new, handsome
and convenient building, which will be
made ready for the use of the oarsmen
as quickly as possible. The architect
of the house is Frank Van Trees.

ing Flaneur for $725.
The Seattle and Portland stakes close
to-day. "
The polo pony race has been post
poned until Saturday next.
The pick of the two-year-old division
will start in the Gebhard handicap at
Oakland this afternoon, with the ex
ception of Prince Brutus, which is on
the sick list. The two most prominent
areArisbe and Pinkerton, which pair
fought it out for the Bell stakes, re
sulting in a victory for the former
crack filly. George P. McNear, " Rose
Eley and Ben Eric are all considered
quantities.
Floriana Belle and The Bugaboo,
which finished first and second, respect
ively, in the last event, were both' bred
at Napa stock farm.
ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
NOTES OP THE TRACK.
Another: exceedingly warm favorite
was counted out in the next, a Futurity
course selling run. Brennus, with
Henry Spencer, up, was touted around
as "Hawkins' hoss,"" and the books
were bombarded, the odds dropping to
4 to 5. With Sir Preston bottled* up,
and .when everything began "looking
rosy for the favorite, Buxton on Skip
Me, an S to 1 shot, got up, winning by
a neck. Vcinzollern showed some early
speed, and will do later -oh.
Horton .finally- made through, con
nections with a purse. The little
horse ruled favorite for the mile
selling affair and won and that's
about all. Far out of it at the start,
he looked an easy winner, at the bend
for home, and then only downed Billy
Moore a neck. The latter horse inter
fered, with Flaneur the closing seventy
yards, and was set back one position,
the place being awarded by the judges
to the McCafferty horse. â¢
Billy Magrane's old stand-by. Matt
Hogan, made"Ehort work of his field
In the six-f urlong run, next decided.
He received consistent support at' 13
to 10, and. : gradually forging to the
front, finished more than a length in
advance of My. Surprise at the wire.
Mocorito had many admirers, but ran
disappointingly, finishing third. Saint
ly also made an indifferent showing.
BRENXUSJS THE CIIOICE..
This is the season for long shots, and
among the Skinners at Oakland yester
day was Floriana Belle, which, 1 piloted
by little CroBswalte, captured the clos
ing race on the card at the mellow
odds of 100 to 1. :
Â¦â¢M.' D. Miller, Jthe filly's owner, fig
ured she had an -outside chance to
win, and under a' scattering play the
odds -were cut to 40 af post time. Ail
element of luck figured in "the outsider's
victory, but that is horse .racing.
Orchan closed favorite at 6 to 5, with
Ebony next in demand; at' 8 : to' '5. .....
Floriana Belle* started out to make the
running and led almost to the stretchy
where Ebony headed her. Sheehan on
the latter picked the. cuppy going on
the. rail, and was lolloTve.d in his selec
tion by Bonner astride- the favorite.
Both tired and were" passed by Floriana
Belle and The Bugaboo, the first named
filly getting the verdict by a neck.
Orchan rah third, beaten less than a
length.
Favorites divided the honors with
longer, priced ones in the betting, tak
ing three â¢ purses. The track was In
fairly good, condition.^ ,
lUTSTjp GIRL'S UBBRAIj ODDS. .,
There was no cause for complaint
on the price" \ laid about Rustic, Girl,
winner of the opening .'sprint. On'pa
per the mare looked much the best,
still some 3% to 1 could be had. She
closed a 2% to 1 favorite, and "went out
and won all the way. J. Jones landed
the outsider Prlestllke in the place, a
nose ahead of the well backed Royal
White. from Harry Stover's
stable, had plenty of speed, but faiied
to stay the route.
Patsy Phillips won his first mount
here on Barney Schreiber's filly Mildred
B, a 12 to 1 shot, for the two-year-old
scramble. Nearly all the ham and egg
players on the' course unlimbered~on
Meada at 2 to 5, the black filly looking
like a little . O. P. S. from the. under
ground cellar. Phillips lost no* time
in getting away from the barrier with
the Schreiber filly and picked the choic
est .going In the stretch. "Willie See,
astride the odds-on choice, was prac
tically compelled to take the rail po
sition, where it was cuppy. Although
Mildred B was tiring, she lasted out,
beating Meada a head. In another few_
strides Howard Vance, a 40 to 1 shot,
with Mountain in. the saddle", would
have won, for he appeared "to be strong
est at the close. He- lost .the place jby
a nose, contributing his part to! an vex-,
citing finish.'- . " . â¢ ; .. >T'

â¢ TO OPEN CAN ON TOP. Force point of bar into center of top of unsealed or smooth end of can.
Bend over until the bar is parallel with the top of can. Set point of lower blade on top of can at whatever
distance from edge" the opening is desired.' Press down handle until blade penetrates the tin. Then pull
gently toward you, holding the can tightly in the other hand. (To get best result hold can by top).
TO OPEN CAN FROM SIDE. Remove label from can. Force point into exact center of top. Bend
over until bar rests on edge of can! Set point of cutting blade against side of can. always at left of side
seam, with lever perpendicular. Press down on lever, which will force side" blade into can. Hold can tisrhtlv
by top with other hand, and cut same as when cutting top. In cutting top oft always let bottom of .bar. rest
and run evenly around edge of can to insure even, regular, cut. â¢ t If the side blade" comes out while cutting, or
cuts in too far and stops, it is because you have not inserted point of bar in exact center of can. Tn this case
throw up lever, readjust blade and continue cutting until blade reaches opposite side of seam, when top can
be lifted or broken off altogether. Do, not be afraid'to grasp can firmly by the top.

Outwits Chinese Bureau.
The Chinatown unofficial bureau yesterday
moraine between 10:30 a. in. and noon out
witted the Chinese bureau of the Government,
and for a full hour one of the free and local
Chinese bawled instructions to his alien
brothers confined In the detention shed at the
Pacific Mall wharf. The free and landed
Chinaman, from o lumber pile near the little
Mull dock, loudly bellowed his memagre, of
which the men behind the barred windows
took copious notes. Th(re is uothlng on the
Pacific Mail wharf more In evidence than the
Chinese bureau Inspector. He is everywhere.
Within sound of the noisily delivered meesagre
lounged half a score of these guardians of
America's gates. The messenger delivered his
message, however, without Interruption, and
then found time to answer the questions which
came In r*Dld-llre order from the throats of
the detained. The nature of the communica
tion Is known only to those Immediately con
cerned. That they considered It Important
was evident from thrlr earnest , manner and
the pains the message- bearer seemed to take
to assure himself that his words had been
understood. '. .-. :~\
by Smoot & Co. at a large expense to
the Mexican Government, suffered se
verely. No lives were lost, and the of
ficers of the Newport did not hear that
anybody was hurt in the shake. A
number of buildings were knocked
down and many more twisted out of
plumb. No shock was felt at sea by
those on the Newport.
The steamer arrived early yesterday
morning. She brought 1683 tons of
cargo, treasure valued at $57,572 and
passengers as follows:
Albert J. Blum. Charles R. -Basehat. John
O'Brien. E. W. Van Ham; wife ar.d child. \V.

A heavy earthquake shook down
many buildings at Manzanillo on the
night of March 24 and did much dam
age to the breakwater under construc
tion at the Mexican port. The earth
quake occurred at 11 o'clock at night,
and when the steamer Newport reached
there the. following morning the inhab
itants were still nervous. Telegraphic
communication was cut off with the
interior, where it was feared the dam
age had been more extensive.

There were, special services at St.
Mary's Cathedral and all the Roman
Catholic churches last , night. The
Rev. Father Philip O'Ryan preached
the sermon at the cathedral., V?.~
The Episcopal churches where
evening devotion took place were
largely attended.
The passion music at the Church of
the Advent was the feature of the
service last night. The cantata, "The
Seven Last Words of Christ," was ren
dered under the direction of John de
P. Teller. Rea Hanna presided at the
organ.
In the^evening there was a big at
tendance of worshipers at St. John,
the Evangelist Episcopal Church,
where the Right Rev. William Ford
Nichols. Bishop of California,-admin
istered the apostolic rite of confirm
ation.. A beautiful musical service
was rendered.
EVENING SERVICES.
His Grace Archbishop Montgomery
was celebrant and Archbishop Rior
dan attended in the sanctuary.
In the singing of "The Passion" the
Rev. Father Ramm took the part of
the historian, the Rev. Father Mulli
gan took the part of the Savior and
the Rev. Father Hannigan that of the
Rabble.
â¢The chief service after the Passion
was the solemn act of. removing the
veil- from the cross by his Grace Arch
bishop Montgomery. When the cross
was divested of its black covering it
was reverently laid on the steps of the
altar and all in the sanctuary, of
ficers, of the mass of the pre-sancti
fied and altar boys performed the act
of veneration of the cross. In .the
performance of the veneration they
prostrated themselves three times,
saying a prayer at each prostration.
Then they finally knelt and kissed the
cross, which was given the people ait'
lhe""rail so that those who desired
might likewise kiss the crucifix. l^h\
A procession was then formed and
the blessed sacrament was carried
from the repository' where it had been
placed the previous day, Holy Thurs
day, back to the main altar of the
church. The celebrant then commu
nicated himself with the sacred host,
consecrated on Holy Thursday.
There were similar impressive and
beautiful services yesterday at St.
Ignatius, St. Dominic's Church, St.
Francis Church and all the Catholic
churches in the city.
There were profound services dur
ing the day, and evening at St. Mary's
Cathedral, where there were large
congregations at each service.
The singing of "The Passion" in the
morning was a part of the impressive
ceremonies.
At Grace Church there was the
usual Good Friday services at 11 and
5 o'clock, conducted by Archdeacon J.
A. Emery. The altar and altar cross
were veiled in black and a great cross
about ten feet high, which is only
placed in the church on Good Fri
day, was covered .with crape. The
Rev. David J. Evans, the new rector,
attended each service.
At Trinity Church the service of
"Words From the Cross" was con
ducted by the Rev. Frederick W.
Clamett, D.D., the rector, assisted by
the Rev. A. J. O'Meara, D.D. There
were services at St. John the Evan
gelist, Holy Innocents, Church of the
Advent, St. Paul's, St. Stephen's, St.
Mary the Virgin, St. James and Cathe
dral Mission.
The 'morning service was conducted^
by the Rev. Burr Miller Weeden, the
rector,, assisted by the Rev. Mr. Hayes.
It seemed yesterday that there was
a greater desire than ever to observe
Good Friday. The Episcopal churches
were crowded and the Roman Catholic
churches were filled to their capacity
and the services were of the most
solemn. .
Bishop Nichols did a character
istically kindly and what would seem
a specially appropriate act for the
day when, hearing of the indisposition
of the Rev. William II. Bours, rector
of St. , Peter's Church, Stockton and
Filbert streets, he sent word to the
pastor that he. himself would take the
Good Friday service at St. Peter's.
The Bishop accordingly conducted
the service in the morning and in the
afternoon he delivered an address at
St. Luke'B, his subject being "Inter
preting the Cross Into Actual Life."

Trade in tne Orange market wag- of smaller

demand for shipping had been satisfied, but
the demand for local consumption continued
brisk and. as stocks were comparatively light,
the market ruled firm and better prices were
obtained for the choice and standard grades
of Navels, both in the open market and in. the
auction rooms, where the offerlngB were larger
than ucuaf: As a result of the continued
etcady demand In the open market there was
a good attendance of Jobbers at the auction

The weakness in Butter and Eggs continues
and dealers are^tllll actively canvassing the
market for buyers, who- are holding off ex
pectin? still lcwsr prices. Stocks of both are
large, and those of Butter are steadily increas
ing, while those of /Egggs are about -sbta
tlonary- Receipts of Eggs thus far this" week
have not been as heavy as they were a few
days aso, but they have been more than the
market could absorb. The arrivals of Butter
have beeen larger during the past two days and
the spot stock is getting unwieldy. There are
Etill some â¬00,000 lbs of cold storage Butter
on hand, which is an enormous quantity for
this time of the year, especially as the new
grass product is coming forward so freely.
There r.re no quotation? for this cold storage

they are discontinued, for the present at least.

of which were no larger than Squab Pigeons,

and railway earnings thus far reported
for March are but 1.2 per cent smaller
than last year. Agricultural prospects
are unchanged. . ..
. Further progress in the right direc
tion is reported in the iron and. steel
industry. Increased activity and
somewhat firmer quotations, in West

interest on the part of tanners- Com

SL'MMJRY OF THE MARKETS.
: NEW- YORK, r ; April' 1.â Bradstreet's
to-morrow will say: Low temperatures
and heavy rains, bad roads and floods
have checked spring trader delaying
collections, discouraged the Easter de
rrrand and closed- a three months'
period of rather backward business in
the North,, East and West.
There are some redeeming features.
Agricultural implement men have done
probably the- best -season's , trade, on
record, the railways are gradually win
ning put their, transportation difficul
ties, the Western clothing and shoe
trades have done very well and the
feeling in the iron and steel trade. is a
more cheerful one than seemed pos
sible a short time ago. While; nearly
all signs- point to a smaller- turn over,
in the country's trade than in 1903,
the feeling is still general that the
crop outlook, stimulated by high
prices, favors large yields, and warm,
dry weather is eagerly awaited as fur
nishing a true test of the real trade
situation. " t *;'-'Â¦;

R. G. Dun & Co.'s Weekly Review
of Trade to-morrow will say :\
Much deferred Eastern business was
transacted during the last few days
and some sections report satisfactory
results, but at many points the
weather is not yet normal, and, on the
whole, the * season's trade . thus far
compares. unfavorably with last year's
volume. Manufacturing returns are
conflicting/iron and steel plants gain
ing ground, .footwear exhibiting the
natural reaction from an unprecedent
ed production in 1903, while the tex
tile mills have much, idle machinery
and little forwar.d business to encour
age operations.. Lumber-and building
materials are in better demand, al
though floods at the West and labor
trouble at 'the East retarded struc
tural work to some, extent.
Â¦ Transportation is still interrupted by.

by'the tragic suicide af United States

larly, made no objection and.the order

â¢ Then . Woodworth sprung his f?ur
Â¦pripe. -He called f or Thomas F. Burnett,
the latter walked .to the ' stand.
â¢The. witness 'said he. was captain of
the Jail on Broadway, where Chinese
awaiting deportation are kept, and had
â¢charge of the door leading to the street.
Dasha had charge of -the top tier of
"cells', and Dempsey' had charge of the
yard. ; AH worked on the same shift
"and had charge of the Chinese.
. "Did you- ever 'have" any conversation
wijth Dasha and Dempsey on the sub
ject of substituting Chinese?"
. This question brought all the coun
sel for the defendants to their feet at
qnce'*with objections. Burnett was a
co-defendant, â¢ they . sard â a co-con
;Â«piratb.r-^and his evidence was .not
admissfble unless it could "be proved
first -that a conspiracy existed between
the parties: " The objection was over
ruled and the .witness continued:
SYORVOF A CRIME.
.. .'"It was about in March or April
last year that Dasha. Dempsey and
Ynyiself made" a compact to substitute
Chinese'. On August 17 or 18 Horn
Toon came to. the County. Jail in the
evening with three Chinese who were
to be* changed Â«foc three men held for
deportation-. Dasha .' and Derripsey
were present a\ the time. The three
substitutes were left and Horn Toon
went away.' When Horn Toon came to
the Jail on the afternoon of August
17 he asked me if I would -make the
change and I said I would.
' "Dash'a and Dempsey were present
and saw the Chfnese. J woujd not
say whether or not these men , took
the heathens â¢ held for* deportation
from the yard." They were changed In
my presence. "Horn Toon had the
names of Chinese he wished taken
from the Jail. The three- brought Into
the jail were placed in the cells occu
pied by the others- and the three re
leased were' taken to ' the street by
Honi Toon and turned loose. Horn
Toon paid $600 for the Job^. I gave
Dasha and Dempsey what was coming
to them. It was understood that the
money should be divided among these
two,. Gamble and myself. Gamble
furnished us with the names of the
Chinese and the numbers of their
cases. On the morning of the 18 th
he called at the jail and took six Chi
nese, including the three substitutes,
to the ship."
Attorney Schooler 'for Dasha then
commenced the cross-examination.
He asked Burnett if there had been
any agreement prior to 1903. Witness
said he- could not* remember. He
knew that Horn Toon had often asked
him to switch Chinese, but he told
him he couldn't- It was a week t or
ten days before the last switch was
made' that Horn Toon met him near
the jail and made him a proposition.
"Did he say how much money he
would give you?"
"I told ; him' how : much I would
want. I wanted $200 per man to
switch." Â¦ " â¢ ' '.:_.'Â¦
DIVIDING THE COIN.
"Did ..you tell: him you would. give
Dasha and Dempsey each a third of
the J200?" ,
"He didn't need to ask me because
he knew. I don't know, that I told him
that I would give them and Gamble
any money. After Horn Toon spoke
to me I spoke to Dasha about it, but
I don't know whether Dasha had seen
Horn Toon previously to that time."
"Did you enter specifically Into any
agreement to work for Horn Toon?'!
' "Our agreement was to work for any
body that came along. Dasha, Demp
sey and myself made this agreement
among ourselves in the Jail."
Attorney McGowan then asked the
witness If he was in any pressing need
of money at the time, and he said he
was not. After objections had been
made ; and sustained to several other
questions of minor importance, Bur
nett resumed his seat in the body of
the court, and A. L. Farish of the Mar
shal's office was called for the purpose
of- identifying a return on the affair
that had been made by Gamble. Â¦>' Â¦
William F. Burns, the well known
secret service agent from Washing
ton, told of his interviews with Dasha
and Dempsey in the Rues House soon
after the substitution. He denied. that
he had the men in a "governmental
sweatbox," as inferred by the defense,
and said that both made free and vol
untary confession^. There was consid
erable effort on the part of the attor
neys for the defendants to prevent
these confessions from becoming a por
tion of the record, the claim , being
made that they were Invalid by reason
of having been made under duress and
Intimidation. The 'court ruled other
wise, and Burns continued. It was
stipulated, however, that the state
ments made by either. Dasha* or Demp
sey would not be "binding upon the
other, and his Honor cautioned the
witness to omit as many names as pos-'
sible except that of the. particular party
he was quoting.
According to the witness, Dasha had
told of how in the fall of 1902 Horn
Toon, had on four different occasions
asked him to substitute Chinese. He
refused these four offers, but accepted
the fifth, receiving $332. and a sixth,
for which he gpt $200. With Dempsey
and Burnett he had transacted .busi
ness in June, July and August.- Burns
paid that he had questioned Dempsey
on the same occasion, but did not; get
much information from him. He said
that ) on two occasions he had received
$25 and $30, â¢ respectively, and that, al
though , he , knew of the substitutions,'
he was not one of a ring.

On August 26, so continues the com
plaint, the corporations leased to them
selves the same pieces of property sold
by them, and that the leases were of
great value and the, several corpora
tions have occupied the several prop
erties from the date of. the lease to. the
present time. The rental value ex
ceeded $100,000, and it is -alleged that
the .directors and their corporations
have been receiving more. than $100,000
per annum and .converting and apply
ing the I same to their own 'uses and
have never accounted to nor paid the
Pacific Coast Seeded Raisin Company
any part Â¦ of the , same. In one para
graphAt is alleged that the, directors
entered into /a" fraudulent conspiracy
and ! to use the: Pacific
Coast I Seeded V Raisin Company solely
for their own .gain and .have followed,
out that ' agreement.. The - amount of

erty; etc. Included in these transfers
was one by the Porter Bros. Company

$45,704,23; -to the Fresno Home Pack
ing, Company v $29,557 43; to the Porter
Bros. Company, $4i,261 38. These prom
issory notes are alleged to be a part
of a pretended indebtedness J for which
certain ( assessments were subsequently
levied.
Then it is alleged that on July 11,
1901, the same directors caused the Pa
cific Coast Seeded Raisin Company to
return all brands and trade marks to
the corporations and to Forsyth, and
allowed each of "them to continue In
business and to use and control the
good will of their, various businesses
without any consideration being paid
to the'Pacific Coast Seeded Raisin Com
pany, and that this was in furtherance
of a combination and agreement made
between the corporations and Forsyth
that the Pacific Coast Seeded Raisin
Company should be used solely for
their own benefit. .
that was ". voted to the corporations
mentioned; that the alleged considera
tion for the issue of the. stock was the
sale and transfer by the -corporations
of their brands and trade marks, and
that the distribution was made with
out regard for the number, character
or value of the brands and without re
gard to the good will of the business
