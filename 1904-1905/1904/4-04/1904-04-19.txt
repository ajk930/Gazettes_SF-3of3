' AMERICA'S HUMANITY.
The power with which the declaration
was made fairly aroused the great-as
semblage, which applauded again and
again. .
Dr. Abbott then turned his attention
to the country's responsibility to other
nationalities, during which" he^ spoke of
the Filipinos, a r people that had fallen
under (American . sovereignty.} and" a
people for whom America' had become
responsible. '/f^^^^^M
Any American, he said, who does not
take an interest in politics is not the
best citizen, a sentiment that ' again
elicited much applause..
There are, said the doctor, about 70,
000,000 in the : land and ; the largest
Presidential vote is 12,000,000, which
means that everv man has a, vote 'for
five people, and besides that the voter
is a trustee just as much as Edward
of England, or the President, or ! any
man in . Congress. !
He considered that the man who will
not -sacrifice a day or an hour in or
der to take a share in the ruling of this
Government has no right to call him
self an American. -'
It meant, said the doctor, that those
who "make the utterance do not care
for their fellow men.
MEN WHO DO NOT CARE.
Dr. Abbott electrified his hearers
with some . American ideals. J - The
schplar and teacher, after, illustrating
much that,, has gone before, from ,the
date of the Puritan settlement 1 in the
land, came boldly on to the present
and its conditions. . He described t the
qualifications required-. of men/in :cer
tain States in the! South before they
can cast their, votes. There the quali
fications are the ability to read â¢' and
write English, accumulate .property to
the amount of $300, and they must
pay a poll tax. .The illustration drew
forth applause. - â¢
Dr. Abbott said > that . government is
a divine organization and the , con
scientious and-^intelligent - are to lead
the nation. He wondered what Crom
well would have said of Americans who
declare that they do not care for poli
tics.
Men prominent in all walks of pro
fessional and mercantile life assembled

When the mother of Alice died, four
years ago, the girl's father was thought
to 'be near death -from a critical ill
ness. At that time Joseph Cannon,
with Dagg's consent, adopted the child.
Six weeks later.^according to Dagg's
petition, the . Cannons left the child
with Dr. and Mrs. Williams, where f he
has since spent most of her life: ?
Instead of dying, as was expected,
Dagg recovered, returned to work and
for nearly two years has been paying
Williams for the care of his daughter.
Mrs. Cannon, who had removed to
Portland to care for an aged mother,

" the Responsibilities of
the People of the Land
WASHINGTON, April 18.â "All this
have they done, Mr. President, and in
return we have not done a d-n â d thing
for them."
This was the amazing remark made
by ', Nelson in the Senate to-day.
He was talking of Alaska. The state
ment was a surprise to all present, ap
parently as much to the speaker as to
his audience. There seldom has been as
spontaneous an outburst of laughter in
the Senate as the exclamation' pro
voked, Nelson joined in the merri
ment, though with many evidences of
embarrassment. His only apology was
the remark that "sometimes adjectives
came from the heart," and with that
he closed his speech.
The conference report on the army
appropriation bill had been read, and
the discussion turned on the need of
wagon roads in Alaska, . Nelson say
ing that there was not a single road
in that Territory, and Teller asserting
that if $D00,000 ,could be spent in the
building of such roads there would be
a rich return in the increase of gold
production. Messrs. Proctor and
Quarles said- that it had been impos
sible to secure more than $25,000 f rom '
the House conferees. . -
Nelson predicted that within. the next
generation Alaska would have a popu
lation of a million. He related many
details of his observation in Alaska*
whlle_ visiting the country 'as a mem
ber of the Senate committee, and
aroused much interest as he told of its
resources, the hardships to which the'
settlers are subjected and the little
.that had been done for the people. He
grew especially zealous in his pre
sentation of t!ie"""productlon of, precious
metals, furs, etc.,: and his zeal In thjs
connection was scarcely exceeded by
the indignation he exhibited as he de
picted the niggardliness of the Govern- ,
.ment. in dealing with the Alaskans. At
last, completely forgetting Himself,; he
uttered, the . vigorpus 'remark which
startled the 'solons' .". and created the
merriment. _ .*...'
The House to-day, passed the last of
the supply bills of the Government, the
general deficiency ' measure, after a
stormy, session which' lasted until 8:15
in the evening. The contest was a
party one over the deficiency appropri
ation for, penslo'ns,'- which the Demo
crats tried ineffectively^ to amend by
incorporating as a law the recent ex
ecutive age disability pension; An er
Â¦ fort was made by Moon of Tennessee
to secure an aye and no vote on his
amendment as to the age disability or
der, but the Speaker refused to recog
nize him for this purpose. ."' > />
* On a pro forma motion to recommit
the bill the Democrats, angered by the
Speaker's refusal to recognize Moon,
- secured a rollcall, ' but after' thÂ« .vote
: had been taken all further opposition
Â¦ ceased and the bill was passed.- '. ;,. :

VIGOROUS WORDS
"It is probable that the value of the
exports, "of the country for the fiscal
year will exceed the value of the im
ports by a million dollars. Trade with
the United States Increases rapidly and
will continue to grow as the sugar,
tobacco, fruit and cotton are being ex
tended."
and cotton will be well displayed.
Americans are planting oranges quite
extensively. The groves are doing well.
Cotton Is attracting attention, too, and
bids fair to be very profitable. There
are no pests to endanger the cotton.
"The coffee crop will be about nor
mal this year for the first time since
the hurricane and if a slightly higher
price can be had for the crop planters
will be able to relieve their estates of
part of their old mortgage debts and
will be satisfied.
Senator Grady does not believe what hÂ«
said himself. His absurd argument will not
for a moment deceive any intelligent man in
this convention. If you think of what Senator
Orady propose* you will see- that I am Justi
fied in saying that it Is not intended to ap
peal to the sincere, the honest and fair mind
of any delegate in the convention.
This was â¢ received ; with ;_vocif erous
applause..;^ He .; challenged , ; any friend
of. Judge | Parker to" find. in Tammany's
position, any lack of appreciation . of
that able 'jurist .
"We ask to meet the question, next
July," he said. "We all have'in mem
ory times , when " conditions changed
between-April and July. Moreover, wo
believe this ..will comport better with
the Chief Judge fof the .^Court . of Ap
peals. An instructed delegation is
never a very edifying sight. It* usually
carries ( very little weight to 5 favor a
candidate because you 'we're ordered to
do so. How much better to act on the
basis of mature and conscientious
judgment." . â¢ ..'â¢"'
Senator McCarren .then took up the
cudgels for the other side.â He began
by saying that the smallest boy in the
gallery did not- believe N a word that
Senator Grady had said.
Instantly pandemonium broke loose.
Mingled cheers and hisses rose and fell
for fully two minutes before Senator
McCarren could proceed. He said:
"On ; behalf .^.of. the minority of ;. the

Realizing, however, that the electoral votes
of New York are absolutely essential to Demo

throughout the country that Alton B. Parker,
a Democrat in the prime of . life, haa been
elected by a majority of more than' 60,000 to
the chief position â¢ in the Judicial system ol
this State, and during -the last six years has
discharged the duties of his high office with

cheered loudly, but not for long. Mr.

platform and Senator Grady offered
the following minority amendment: .

-.Now. the minority has a higher opinion' of
Judge. Parker, than those 'gentlemen who. pro
fess to be his friends aeem to entertain. We
belie\-e that on his record he may . and very
likely will be the strongest jnan that the con
vention can nominate. We don't believe that
we should load- down Judge Parker with the
political hopes and .'aspirations of any man' or
set j of men. We bflieve that In our minority
report we have -given reasons why, if condi
tions do not change, he should be nominated
by the convention at St. Louis.
Senator Hill arose in the Albany dele
gation amid wild cheering and sug
gested that ;the vote be taken by coun
ties. This was agreed to. The New
York amendment was lostâ 141 to 301.
The platform \ as originally reported
was adopted by a viva voce vote. This
list of delegations.. alternates and Elec

new State committee was announced.
This committee will organize - next

is understood, as chairman.
A resolution was adopted that the

Congressman W. Bourke Cochran fol
lowed in a ringing speech. He said:; .
He has told you that an Instructed delegation
is not always a good thing. Instructed dele

Grover Cleveland; in .1888 an Instructed dele
gation secured hia renomination; an instructed
delegation in 1000 secured the vote of the
delegation from New York in favor of Wil

here as a delegate . that - no true . friend of
Judge Parker would have the information go

failed to instruct its delegates to St. Louis.
Senator ; Grady has told you that something
may occur between now and -July. Nothing
will: occur to make Judge Alton B. Parker
any less' the available - candidate that he is
now. We know that there is not a candidate
before us to-day except Alton B. Parker with
any chance of election.- As the friend -of Judge

ADVERTISEMENTS. 'Â¦'^''/Jl'-L'}'!:
The better clafes of druggists, everywhere, are men of ecientific attainments and high integrity,
who devote their lives to the welfare of their fellow men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents of known "value, in 'accordance with physicians' prescriptions and
scientific formula. Druggists of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, 5 but
always under' original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the men to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard .remedies and corresponding-adjunclfcuofa first-class pharmacy and the finest and <
best of toilet articles and preparations and'many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
.conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of 6fudy*and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of
Figs is an excellent laxative. remedy and that*it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to4he well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article' bearing the full
name of the Companyâ California Fig Syrup . Co.â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in # cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or
over-eating, that there is, no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its effects aa
Syrup of Figs, and they are glad to Bell it because it gives universal satisfaction.
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and thÂ»
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists to be foundj here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of-their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations^
sometimes have the name â * Syrup of Figs'/â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes .
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," which'
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been 6o,unfortunate as to enter his.
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the -filling of
physicians' prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who -values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages onlv, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform tne public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold, to them. If it does not bear the. full name of the Company â
California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article antf to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class of
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

The Modesto a'nd Turlock canals;
both watering the same region* : consti
tute the greatest irrigation system In
America. The canals, traversing an
area of 1 260,000 acres,, aggregate jabout
250 miles. The mains are severity-four
and sixty-four feet wide on the bottom
and are designed to carry a depth of
eight and six feet of . water, respec
tively. KfeV
The Tuolumne River, with a water
shed second only, to that of -one other
stream in the State, furnishes an
abundant supply for these artificial
rivers. The cost of the works has been
$2,500,000. Already 30,000 acres .of the
land which* has made Stanislaus first
in wheat 'production has been with
drawn from that industry and planted
to fruits, vineyard and other field pro
ducts with success. Next season will
see 50,000 acres under such cultivation,
and in less than five years 100,000 acres
will be devoted to diversified industry.
People from all sections of the State
will visit Modesto to witness this cele
bration, as the completion of this great
water system will demonstrate the feas
ibility and practicability of successfully
handling water under the Wright law,
which means that .the water is owned
and controlled by the people. The trip
will be a delightful one. Train and car

Plans on Foot to Construct
Network of Electric Roads
in Santa Clara County
SAN JOSE, April IS.â Some big de
velopments in electric railway building
is expected in this city and county
vithin the next thirty days. F. S.
Grander, who recently retired from the
San Jose and Los Gatos Interurban
Hallway, has interested a number of
San Francisco capitalists in road build-
Ing In this vicinity. Already they have
pledged 5750,000 for a network of lines
radiating: from this city. George C.
Chadwick, a well-known engineer of
San Francisco, has been engaged by
Â¦the syndicate, and they now have a
corps of engineers in the field selecting
a number of routes.
It is said that a road will be built
from Los Gatos to this city by way of
Campbell, others into Berryessa and
Evergreen and a line by way of Santa
Clara to Palo Alto. F. S. Granger, who
is promoting the scheme, has opened
offices in the Ryland building. He will
not state just where the roads are to be
built, but from parties on the outside
it is said the lines will be the same as
stated above. fc A large party of the
men Interested in the new company
was here last week and went over the
route. The engineers will report on the
feasibility and cost of the proposed
routes in a week or so. and then a
company will be organized tÂ» build the
roads.
The roads will be first class and broad
pauge and as finely equipped as any
in the State. It is proposed to use the
l:nest kind of rolling stock and make
fast time. The capitalists who are in-
x crested in the project are mostly from
San Francisco, and it is said that they
nvc ready to raise even millions for
electric lines running out of this city
provided they can be shown that the
nmds wi!l give good returns.
IT. S. Granger is the man who brought
into this city the Kastern capital that
i>uilt the Interurban Electric Railway.
Ho declares emphatically that no other
Â»>lace on the Pacific Coast offers the
chance for investment as this
<ity. He hopes to have things jn such
shapp in a month that he will be able
to apply for the franchises.

has' been continuous and' under his
contract he alleged that he was to
have received $200 weekly and 25 per

The loss of the microscopes Â» was not

determined by the authorities that the
theft ocodrred on Friday night on ac
count of the fact that one of the geol

covered the hole in the window pane
through which the burglar unfastened
the lock and raised the window.
The two microscopes were valued at
J500 and were very fine instruments.
This burglary recalls the one of a
few months ago when a pair of ex
pensive balances were taken from the
assay laboratory and were found in a
field adjoining the building the morn
ing after the burglary. The character
of that theft is so similar to the one
of Friday night; that there seems a
likelihood that 'there is some'connec
tion between the two.

probable that the Japartese will be
able to add anything material to their
naval success. The opinion is drawn

a white column shot up. There was a

While the' story published in the
Standard and the one given in the
above dispatch do not agree in all de
tails, their similarity and the geo
graphical . location of the attempted
landing lead to the conclusion that
both reports refer to the same occur
rence.
The correspondent of the London
Standard at St. ' Petersburg sent in a
dispatch to his paper on April 15 say
ing, it was rumored that Vice Admiral
Togo's fleet had' escorted a number, of
Japanese transports to land troops at
a point to the west of the Yalu River.
When 12,000 Japanese had disem
barked the Russian troops, who were
lying, concealed, - suddenly attacked
them and drove them back to their
ships with heavy losses in men and
guns.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns that about a fortnight ago
Vice Admiral Makaroff telegraphed to
the Emperor that he had searched a
number of suspicious looking Chinese
junks which were hovering about the
entrance of the harbor and found them
loaded with vegetables, but in the stern
of one of them was found a contact
mine. This piece of information
strengthens the Japanese mine version.
It is" asserted here with great posi
tiveness that Russia has purchased two
hattleships at Schichau and Elbirig.
As a result of the Petropavlovsk dis
aster the Admiralty has given orders
that the Baltic and Black Sea warships
l>p fitted with longitudinal bulkheads,
and that the latter be pierced so as to
permit of communication between the
v. atertight compartments on either side
of the vessels.
Major General Pflug, chief of the mil

LONDON. April IS.â The Foreign Of
fice has received a communication from
the Russian Government relative to the
use of wireless telegraphy by war cor
respondents. It is identical with the
note received by the Government,, at
Washington, and says Russia does not
contemplate any immediate action in
the matter. The pronouncement, ac
cording to the Foreign Office, raises
such a number of new issues that it
requires the most' careful consideration.
PARIS. April lS.âIt is generally held
here that Russia is Justified in issuing
its prohibition of.the use of the wireless
telegraph within .the zone of naval ope
rations. The Question* is not compli
cated as far as Paris is concerned, as
no French newspapers' have an interest
in it directly through possession erf a
press boat in Eastern waters. After
consideration - officials of the marine
ministry to-day agreed that wireless
telegraphy apparatus must be held as
contraband of war the moment one of
the belligerents is able to -prove that
it has been prej6dicial to its interests
by rendering service *to the enemy. .

king, sought to recover the culture of
the old Roman empire. The art of
the fifth and sixth centuries can be
studied only at Ravenna, the speaker

Gives Interesting Lecture,
Adolph Sylva will not have to serve
three months In the Marln County Jail
as decreed by Judge Lennon, accord-
Ing to a decision handed down by the
Supreme Court yesterday. The "ex
boss of Sausalito" was convicted of
assault upon Attorney L. C. Plstolesl.
He maintained that the instructions of
the court were inadequate and erro
neous, and the* State's highest tribunal
sustains his contentions, / :
Pistoles! represented the plaintiff in
the case of Farley vs. Sylva. Judg
ment was secured against, the Marin
County politician : and his law books
were, levied upon. Attorney "Pistolesi;
in company with Deputy. Sheriff R. G.
Lichtenberg and Constable Paul
Trouette, went to Sylva's house for the
purpose of seizing^-the books. Sylva
was not at home, but the visitors found
'a small boy. on the premises, who pro
duced the keys to the house.
Pistolesi and the deputy sheriff were
about to enter, when . Sylva appeared
and inquired what they "were doing.
They informed him of the purpose of
their visit and he became ' enraged.
After calling Pistolesi a "grand lar
ceny thief" and other less euphonious
names Sylva secured a gun and, point-
Ing it at the attorney, ordered him
off the* premises. Florence Sylva,'de
fendant's sister, appeared at this junc
ture, revolver in hand, and gave Pisto
lesi'a verbal castigation.
The lawyer, the deputy sheriff and
the constable finally went away with
out'the law books. Then Pistolesi had
Sylva arrested for assault with a dead
ly weapon. The Jury found the de
fendant guilty of . assault \ and Judge
Lennon sentenced Sylva to , three
month's in the County Jail. -The Su
preme Court says that the defendant
could not be deemed guilty unless It
was shown that \he gun was* loaded
and that he attempted to discharge it.
The court gave W. H. Owens his free
dom yesterday. The defendant was
held to answer before the Superior
Court by Judge Mogan for alleged com
plicity in a robbery committed Decem
ber 6, 1903, at a Howard-street saloon.
It was shown that Owens had become
acquainted with Howard, the real rob
ber, by accident and knew nothing of
the scheme to holdup the saloon. \
The court held that the indictment
in the case of M. M. Shearer, a physi
cian employed by the' Supervisors of

TACOMA, Wash., ADril 18.â A
unique scheme for mak'ntr barren lend
fertile Is being trlfd at several places
In Eastern Washington and also near
Pendleton, Oregon. After some experi
menting with good results, farmers are
using dynamite to break up hard pan
stratum, which lies Just beneath the
surface. Superintendent McDlll of the
Pendleton Poor Farm has found that
excellent soil exists oaneath the hard
pan, together with an abundance of
water. The hard pan keeps the'mois
ture from coming to the surface and
likewise prevents trees or alfalfa roots
from penetrating down to the moisture.
In consequence the surface, of the
ground is dry alkali and will grow
nothing but sage brush. By breaking:
up this stratum of hard pan, McDlll
figures that the moisture will have a
chance to rise and the roots to go
down. Crops are being planted over
a large area of ground where dynamite
has been used for this purpose. Com
plete results will not be known until
fall, but if the crops grow as expected,
dynamite will become an important
factor in breaking up the sage brush
land underlaid with hard pan near the
surface.

TACOMA. April 18. â John J. Rut
ledge, a prominent mining man and
promoter at Dawson, announced there
on his return from California that
three gold dredgers costing $600,000
will 'be taken into the Yukon basin
this summer. The Forty Mile Com
pany, which owns the concession from
the mouth- of Forty Mile River to the
boundary, will take in one dredger.
In this company Rutledge is interest
ed. Former Governor William Ogll
vie will take in another dredger for
use on Stewart River. The third one
will be taken into the Atlin country.
The dredger bought by Rutledge while
outside has been used in California.
The company did not have time to
construct a new dredger in season for
use this summer and accordingly pur
chased Â¦ one already at work in the
California placer districts.
Rutledge announces that two big
American concerns will Invest heavily
in Klondike mining this season. They
purpose buying large areas of hydrau
lic ground and working them by hy
draulic plants or dredgers.

The petition of the German General
Benevolent Society that a penalty of

W. Scott, O. S. Mertz Company and
Elizabeth Rodgers, owners of property

a bunchy umbrella in his right hand,
on a very narrow sidewalk, and that
while I- -. was squeezing himself past

Thomas White and Max Peters were
walking along Kearny street about 2
o'clock yesterday morning, and while
passing a soberly clad stranger one
of . them uttered the word "damn,"
which so shocked the stranger that he
stopped the young men and began de
livering a vehement exhortation on the
gin of profanity. Instead of giving a
respectful hearing to the homily Mr.
White and Mr. Peters interrupted it
by flippantly chiding Its author for
"butting in" where he was not wanted;
and their irreverent remarks bo exas
perated the stranger that he expressed
a wish that they would be damned.
}Then they laughed at him until he
struck one of them, and while they
were endeavoring to retaliate in kind
he suddenly blew a loud blast on a
police whistle and nimbly ran away.
Patrolman Cavanaugh responded to the
shrill call and arrested White and
Peters for disturbing thÂ« peace.
"And the godly man who butted in â
what became of him?" inquired Judge
Cabaniss when he .had heard the po
liceman's story and the defendants'
t-xplanation.
"He ducked before t could grab
him," replied the officer.
Counsel for the defense asked for
dismissal on the ground that since the
case was started the parties have been
divorced, and that the husband had
transferred to the wife half of the
community property. The Judge said
that the. subsequent divorce did not
wipe out the battery charge, and that
he must find the defendant guilty.
Then the attorney pleaded that one of
the conditions of settlement out of
court was that the battery charge
would be dismissed, and when the
Judge sharply inquired by what au
thority such a condition had been pro
posed the attorney answered that his
client had been so assured by the legal
luminary on the other side. The latter
was called to the bench and asked if
he had ewr given such assurance, and,
if so, by what right had he undertaken
to usurp the prerogatives of the Judge.
He denied the accusation, but the other
lawyer stuck to it, and the defendant,
too, declared it was true. There the
matter was allowed to rest.
Viencke will be sentenced to-day.

Prosper Viencke culminated in his
arrest, on complaint of his wife,
alleging battery, and when ths
case was called before Judge Fritz it
was set over from time to time at re
quest of one or other of the contending
attorneys, the apparent purpose being
to effect a settlement out of court. That
this was finally done came to light yes
terday, and that it did not result as
satisfactorily as the defendant desired
was also disclosed.

"You are public servants," declared
his Honor, "and as such It is your duty
to press to a conclusion any case you
may commence. I have noticed that
3'our demeanor in this court has been
discourteous to say the least, and I de
sire to have you understand that no
contempt will be permitted."
. "Discourtesy has been shown me,"
argued Meyers.
"You are discourteous now, else you
would not remain seated while^'ou are
addressing this court," said the Judge.
"Attorneys and others who are Just as
good as you are do not assume an ar
rogant or disrespectful attitude while
they are addressing this court."
Meyers, who had been seated
throughout the discussion, moved un
easily In his chair, but said nothing,
and the Judge saved him from further
embarrassment by ordering the cases
dismissed.
"W. F. Uafred ana F. W. Bell, propri
etors of a metal polishing factory at 22
Jessie street, were arrested on April 1
and charged with violating the statute
which makes it compulsory to have the
health of the machinists employed in
such establishments protected by de
vices which carry off the metal dust
that otherwise might enter the lungs of
the workmen. Judge Mogan then told
The defendants that it was their duty
to comply with the law in that respect
and they promised to do so, pleading
that they had not already done so be
cause the devices Interfered with the
proper working of the machinery. At
the same time the Deputy Labor Com
missioner who had made the arrests
was Instructed to see that the court's
order was carried out and to report
yesterday, and when the case came up
yesterday the Judge was Informed that
the deputy had been told by Meyers to
pay no atention to the court's in
struction. t . .
"Did you say that?" inquired the
Judge, sharply, addressing Meyers.
"Well, not exactly," was the reply.
"I may have said something like that,
because I considered our duty of in
spection finished when the arrests were
made. We are State officers."
Incidental to the hearing of a case in
which the complaining witness was F.
V. Meyers, State Commissioner of La
bor, that official and Judge Mogan en
gaged in quite | an Interesting contro
versy and the court won most of the
honors.
Patrolman Burns was in full uniform
when he arrested seventeen boys at
Harbor View last Sunday and charged
them with crap-shooting. The only
proof ! he could furnish that* they had
so offended was the finding of two /dice
on the spot where .he \ caught ;-â¢ them
grouped. He" did not see'; them- shoot
craps, nor could he\ swear positively
that they did shoot craps.
"The, next time you go forth to cap
ture crap-shooters," - said . Judge- Mo
gan in. a kindly â¢ way, ;* v 'wear- plain

Four times did Charles Wilson, . a
druggist, return to the Geary street sa
lcpn Â¦ from Â¦ which he had been' forcibly
ejected before he was taken in by a
considerate patrolman, and* then both
of his eyes" had been blackened and
other ' sections of his * countenance
t bruised. He will tell his side of the
story to Judge Mogan next Friday.
Francis Hanska, a German, was ac
cused of terrorizing certain inmates "of
the" Spanish boarding-house on Broad
way In which he dwelt. Thomas Price,
a fellow boarder, testified before Judge
Mog-an that the defendant' had held a
knife in proximity to his (witness*)
throat and threatened to sever his
windpipe, and that he then transferred
his menaces to the landlady of the es
tablishment, who had been made ill by
the experience. . Further testimony will
be heard next Thursday.
corroborated what she said concerning
their regard for her. Every one of
them pronounced her a disagreeable
person. .
"That I am inspired by the Divine
Spirit," was the answer. "If this
court does not help me," she added
slgnificantly, N xa higher one will."
A bevy of Mrs. Lasher's neighbors
The case was continued.
"Which means?" ventured the court
Naughty little boys annoyed Mrs.
Elsie D. Lasher of 2510 Sutter street
until she deluged them with anathemas
and water - and thus disturbed the
peace. To Judge Fritz she explained
that her t feminine neighbors did not
seem to approve her spiritual belief,
which was that of psycho. therapeutics.
Suspecting Ruth Preston's affection
was in process of transference to the
keeping of a detested rival, Edward
Clifford wa&iaid her last Saturday
evening as she was sauntering, along
Kearny street with the ostensible ob
ject of holding tryst, and he accused
her of fickleness and otherwise up
braided her until she lost her temper,
and retorted warmly. Then he struck
her and they were entangled in a rough
and-tumble mix-up, when the in
evitable arrests were made. In the
court of Justice Mogan yesterday
morning Edward looked as if he had
been having an uncomfortable time,
while Ruth appeared in a stunning
tailor-made of creamy white, with pic
ture hat to match, and seemed to be
amused rather than terrified by her po
sition. Both the defendants pleaded
not guilty' to disturbing the peace and
their defense will be heard to-morrow.
The guileless person of pastoral pur
suit immediately complied. "The re
cent heavy rains have saturated the
pastures," he said, "and the grass con
tains an unusually large percentage of
moisture."
"I suppose we must issue a subpena
for the clerk of the weather," said the
Judge, and then he ordered another
continuance. , ,
"As we can't subpena your cow,"
said the Judge, "and as she might be
an unwilling witness if she were here
to testify, will you be so good as to
explain how the milk taken from her
happened to be too heavily diluted
with water?"
There is in the court of Judge Fritz
a milk-adulteration case that has
dragged long and furnished an excep
tional example of how the art of "pass
ing the buck" Is practiced in effort to
balk Justice.
Health Officer Wish arrested a gro
ceryman for having among his wares
a can of lacteal fluid- that contained
more than the legal maximum of aqua.
The groceryman pleaded that he had
not watered the milk, but was selling
it Just as it was delivered to him by
a dairyman. Subpena issued for
dairyman, who appeared and testified
that he had purchased milk from a
farmer and had not "doctored" it in
any way. Farmer subpenaed, and he
passed the responsibility up to the cow,
by swearing that he had not watered
the milk taken from her.
William Hayes, aged and possessed
of only one serviceable eye, and his
son Stephen, aetat 34, and far gone in
tuberculosis, were before Judge Mogan
on the charge of vagrancy. They had
taken up sleeping quarters in an empty
'basement at Brannan and Gilbert
streets, and the owner of the" place
feared that they might accidentally set
fire to it and burn him out of house
and home. After promising to go to
the Almshouse they were dismissed.
After getting Charles, her husband,
arrested for battery, . Mrs. Martha
Jackson relented and informed Judge
Frit* that it was by accidentally fall-
Ing over a stove that she received the
cranial Injuries which were covered by
courtplaster."
"Besides," she pleaded, "Charles is
my only means of support."
"I don't believe the stove story," said
the court, "and I'm afraid that Charles
and you must live apart for a while.
I'll sentence him to-morrow."

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
The saloon where the shooting took
place is, not a mile from the city limits
and upon a~ hillside road that overlooks
the bay. It Is a: much traveled road
and the Werrens receive considerable
money from visitors j oh Sundays, a fact
that must have been known {' to the
highwayman.
Frank Lewis, the other, member of
the trio, had the least dramatic part
in the stirring drama. He acquiesced
in every, demand of the highwayman
and so escaped. In fact, he was the
only one of the three who held up his
hands at the man's command. Werren
said to-day that he .was too frightened
to" throw up his, hands even after he
had been warned thrice to do so. Mrs.
Werren did not comply either.
Dr. J. Edson Kelsey, who attended
Mrs. Werren, is doubtful whether she
will recover, though he says the
chances are In her favor. The great
danger is from pneumonia ; or blood
poisoning. Mrs. .Werren is : 60 years of
age, but still strong and healthy. She
is suffering intensely "from v her wound
arjd Is so excited that; she cannot give
atly coherent account of what hap
pened..
Werren's own escape was miraculous.
When he pushed the desperado through
the saloon door, he expected to be shot
for his pains. The man outside kicked
two or three times at the door and de
manded admittance, ; at the same time
threatening to shoot. He had been dis
appointed of getting â¢ the money he
sought. Werren,, however, made des
perate by the agonizing cries of his
wife, refused to open. That was enough
for the highwayman, 'and in a few
moments all was still again.
HOW LEWIS ESCAPED.
to his cowardice and wantonness. The
man shot her because he thought she
was going for arms or help.
The spirit of self-defense was strong
in Mrs. Werren even after she had
been shot. She did not fall at once, but
with a courage borne of a desire to
avenge herself she staggered into her
house and secured a little old der
ringer, thinking to- use it upon the
bandit. As soon as she emerged from
the _ house, however, she fell to the
ground and was .there found by her
husband, who had in the meantime
ejected the robber.
Mrs. Werren was shot while she was
empty-handed and â¢ absolutely,' defense
less ' agalnst'the; highwayman. ; She: had
sought to 'escape him, but" fell' victim
As the Werren saloon is less than a
mile from the North Berkeley station
of the Southern Pacific Company, it
was an easy matter for the highway
man to get out of town. Trains run
out of town in such rapid succession
that he must have got away long be
fore the news of the crime reached
town.
An incident that occurred . at the
Werren saloon Saturday night goes to
show that it was a premidatated crime.
Two men called there after Werren and
his wife had retired late at night and
deliberately shot 'the watchdog. When
Werren protested against this brutality
the men swore that they had had to
protect themselves. It is evident that
the men got the dog out of. the way
so that they would not be molested or
betrayed before their Sunday work be
gan. True, only one highwayman en
gaged in the hold-up, but it is believed
that he was backed up by a companion
who watched the saloon from the, out
side. At any rate, this is the view held
by Werren and the officers.
HOLD-UP vWAS COLD-BLOODED.
Another Incident that indicates that
the hold-up was well planned was the
evident familiarity of the bandit with
the premises. When Mrs. Werren "dis
appeared through the rear door of the
saloon, even while two revolvers cov
ered herself and companions, 'the man
seemed to know that she would go
through the alley- way between the sa
loon and her house to the' street. For
as soon as he observed her movement he
changed the position of the pistol he
held in his right hand so that it would
cover Mrs.. Werren the moment^ she
reached the street. Thus . he was /pre
pared to shoot the men with. the' plstbl
in his' left hand" and the 'woman a with
the one in his right; he had both the
front and rear door of the saloon cov
ered - trlth ominous looking --.weapons.
There was no e*scape for any of, the vic
tims. ' ' .-...-.: '-:;Â¦Â¦',. ..-Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦ / ' '.'
It is doubtful, however, if any trace
of the fellow is ever found. He left
nothing behind him that might lead to
bis arrest. It is generally conceded
that the man Louis Sullivan saw run
ning down- the ,road toward Berkeley
did the shooting. He was running hard
and did not tarry when Sullivan-ac
costed him, indicating that' he must
have been fleeing from the scene of his
crime. â¢ - :>.,i?
BERKELEY, April 18.â The efforts of
the police were concentrated to-day
upon the lone highwayman who held
up the Werren saloon last, night and
shot Mrs. Elizabeth Werren when she
made some show of resistance. Sher
iff Bishop and Deputy Scanlan were
early upon the scene this morning to
hunt up clews. Peace officers air over
the county were warned to be on the
lookout for a man answering the ban
dit's, description and the police of Oak
land and Berkeley were asked- to co-'
operate in the man-hunt;.

The rain came down in showers to

people away from the fete -the Pryta

for the benefit of the hospital fund.
The gymnasium was crowded all even
ing and everything the co-eds had for
sale went like hot cakes. It cost 10
cents to get in and from $1 to $10 to
get out, according to the personal pop
ularity of the candidates, so that the
Prytaneans are ahead a hundred dol
lars or more. â¢ â¢ * '
It was called a "kirmess,"- and that
is the same thing as a fete. There
were booths of all nations, bedizened in
the -national colors, with pretty girls
In dresses to match. They were to
have it in Co-ed Canyon, but it rained
so that- the _Prytaneans carted their
things * to the gymnasium in wheel
barrows and planted the booths there.

A request on behalf of the estate of
Joseph Dunsmuir was made tÂ£ have
the award of damages allowed by the
viewers, $2500, . increased to $5000. -It
was argued by Attorney A. F. St. Sure
that the right* of . way very seriously
Impaired the value of the place and
that it would cut through valuable im
provements which had been made for
home purposes.
The expressions by the different Su-.
pervisors were that the matter had been
allowed to lie over for a short time
owing to the pressure of other busiftess.
but it was not intended to delay the
w.ork for any great length of time. At
the request of Supervisor Talcott, how
ever, the matter was set as a special
order of business for to-morrow morn
ing, as he stated that a number of
changes in the ownership of property
along the proposed route had taken
place, and he wished to give these
people an opportunity to be heard
without, howevej, changing what had
already been done.
The petitioners that signed the docu
ment were Charles F. Lee, Fruitvale",
J; R. Talcott, 12S3 High street: George
E. Lund. Postmaster, Fruitvale; P. H.
Blake, P. H. Blake Jr., Charles Nelson
and J. S. Kimball of East Oakland.
The matter of building the first sec
tion of the. scenic boulevard to extend
along the Contra Costa foothills from
Oakland to Haywards will be taken up
to-morrow morning at a special ses

matter was brought up this morning
by the filing: of a petition signed by a
number of property owners asking that
the work be proceeded with, Provision
for building part of the roadway was
made in the tax levy of this year, and
It Is now asked that this work be

conclusion of the conference Governor
Peabody and the attorneys declined to
say what decision had been reached.
It Is understood, however, that the Su
preme Court will probably be asked to
modify its order so as to allow the
case to proceed without the appearance
of Moyer. It will be urged that there
would be danger that the posse bring
ing Moyer might be attacked by union
men seeking to liberate him, or that
Moyer might suffer injury at the hands
of enemies,- and that, on the whole. It
would be unsafe to attempt to bring

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE

One Californian measure of which
much was expected early in the ses
sion, and which passed the Senate, lias
come to a definitely hopeless. state in
the House. It Is the bill for the pur
chase of. the Calaveras big trees. Its
place on .the calendar cannot be
reached, and to-day Needham and Mc-
Lachlan made a special plea with
Speaker Cannon for recognition to call
It up out of order. The Speaker "said
the bill did not appear to him to be of
that character to warrant it. He said
California had parks and one of these
had big trees in it. When the. bill was
reached on" the calendar.it could then
stand trial, but not before. Of course,
he said this politely and properly, but
he said it. â¢ ,
But the most unhappy people, in
Washington just now are the' Alaska
contingent. With adjournment impend

nouncing^the conduct of^he .of its.in
stitutions. "**He made sucn^ an Impres
sion that he carried through j a law
based upon a solitary instance that
will radically affect every State sol
diers' home in the country. At Yount
ville he said every soldier inmate draw
ing a pension was compelled to give
up the pension to the managers of the
home, he being given in lieu checks
upon the canteen. He showed how this
created a monopoly for the canteen In
the trade of the soldiers to the limit
of their pension and Invited them to
spend the whole sum for liquor with a
result that was unnecessary to state.
The amendment adopted at his in
stance to the bill requires the managers
of any State soldiers' home, as an in
cident to secure Federal aid, to sub
scribe to the provision of the law gov
erning the home in Washington, D. C,
with this regard. Under this, the man
agers of the home take charge of the
pension, but hold it for the benefit of
the dependents of the soldier as he may
designate, the soldier to receive 5 per
cent for his own use. The bill provides
$75,000 for the Veterans' Home at
Yountville, contingent upon the accept
ance of this provision. Since the intro
duction of the amendment by Bell let
ters and telegrams of protest have
come to members of the delegation
from officers of the Yountville home,
but there has been a notable absence
of such protest from any other home in
the country. And so the amendment
was allowed to pass without objection
in the Senate committee.
The date of adjournment draws near
er day by day by a double process, the
passing of the days and the abbrevia
tion of the session* by. the leaders. A
fhort time ago the middle of May was
looked upon as an ; early adjournment
possibility. Now the 23d to the 28th- of
April is talked of. . As the life of the

CAXTEEX MEASURE.
been a dead level session of Congress,
no very exciting incidents to mark its
months of labor, it is preparing the
way for a sharp contrast in the short
session next to follow. There will be
the impeachment proceedings of Judge
Swayne, the Smoot case and possibly
that of Senator Burton that go over
to that time. They will all afford
plenty of opportunity for controversy,
and might in themselves easily occupy
all the time allotted.' j .The Swayne case
has . split the House Judiciary Com
mittee into two factions where feeling
runs high.' The minority and majority
âwhich is liable to reverse its position,
the minority becoming 'the. majority in,
reality, if not by signature of the re
portsâare committed to radical views
for and against, and these will each^
find followers on the" floor,- the major-*
Ity, for Impeachment, being reinforced
by ' the Southern Democrats. Action
will have to be taken on the Smoot
case, which will develop an interesting
debate, no doubt. As for. the case of
Burton, the Senate will doubtless con
sider, whatever the action .taken, .that
the least said the better.- Whether
there, will be any attempt at a revision
of the tariff next-winter will depend on
the elections and *the, sentiment there
developed. With the appropriation
bills and the other regular business of
the session Congress has enough to
employ it night and day to the 4th of
March.

bills that sailed so' easily through the
Senate will die In the House. The dele

mentable, for even should it pass, the
President, It is said, would veto it. He
does not favor an elective delegate
from Alaska, Believing that such dele

The Senate would doubtless pass a
bill providing for an appointive dele
gate, but the House would notâ so
there you are â with this regard.
â¢The road from Valdez .to Eagle, the
trail to Koyukuk. the fourth Judge and
certain amendments to mining laws
are the things desired at the hands of
the House. They are on the calendar,
but will not be reached. The only way
action can be secured. upon them is by
unanimous consent. Cushman to-day
asked for unanimous consent on the
judicial bill, but Lacey objected. Cush
man- asked him why he objected and
Lacey answered: "Because Judge
Wickersham said there was no need
of another Judge." Judge Wickersham
is reported to have said 'that to many
individuals before he left Washington
to go back to Alaska, while a month
or so earlier he testified before the
Committee on Territories to the great
need of another Judge. The confusion
resulting has had much to do with the
failure of this bill, which has twice
been favorably reported by the com
mittee. And so'the Alaskan colony Is
in despair and is "preparing to. return
to its scattered constituents in the for
lorn north country and, while confess
ing that the big district Is not ready
for territorial government, still to agi
tate for it. declaring that the Govern
ment at Washington, while not grant
ing It representation, while hot allow
ing it to do anything for itself, will do
nothing for it. They were not pre
pared to say, however, just how they
are; to secure 'the territorial govern
ment, which comes to ; well behaved
communities "after long importunity
only by the sufferance i of Washington.

In the H&Hse this \ delegate bill, on

Except for the opposition of Senator
Platt of Connecticut a \ bill providing
for the election of a delegate would at
least have . been thoroughlv discussed
that day and with a fair chance of its
passage, as the Senate was in a very
tractable mood toward Alaska. But
Senator Beveridge, chairman of the
Committee on Territories, as an argu
ment to 'secure unanimous consent for
the consideration of Alaskan bills, had
promised that should | any of the bills
offered provoke" opposition he .would
hot urge them, arid .when Senator Platt
indicated a: hostile temper/ toward the
bill Beveridge did not press it. -, Patter
son, -however, did. He was of the
Alaskan Commission J and he thought
that, the day having been set apart
for Alaska,: It 'should be* devoted to it,
if need be, - to complete the business.
Patterson gaining his point for a time,
Platt offered ' a ' ' rather remarkable
amendment, which provided that the
granting of such delegate did not im
ply that the district of Alaska would
even at any. time be admitted to the
Union as a State. 'As this really meant
nothing except a show of hostility to
the district on the part of an indi
vidual Senator . and â¢ could not prevent
its entrance into the Union when, it
shall have become ripe for that 'dig
nity, friends of the bill did not stop
to oppose the amendment, but accept
ed it promptly. However, debate was
shortly shut off by' an" executive ses
sion, and" that is the last that has
been heard of It on the Senate side.
But the little Alaska colony was*6n
the whole well pleased with the day's
work.
by the .members who visited the dis
trict as the Alaska Commission last
year, has been very favorable, and on
the day set apart for the consideration
of Alaska bills five of considerable im
portance were passed. These were the
bill extending: S the coal land laws to
Alaska and allowing such lands to be
staked in advance of "a general survey:
the municipal; bill; a bill providing for
the creation of road districts and ,the
local improvement of roads; a bill cre
ating a fourth judicial division, and,
finally, the appropriation of $250,000 for
a wagon road from Valdez and $10,000
for building a trail from the Yukon to
Coldfoot. . ' i>"

Spain's Cave Divdler.
Â» The discovery of a troglodyte, (cave
dweller) in the Basque Province, near
Fuenterrabla, on the Franco-Spanish
frontier, has aroused considerable cu
riosity here.
Â¦ As a customs guard, with his dogs,
was cearching in a wood , recently an
extraordinary being in the image of
a man was seen to rush before him
with wonderful rapidity and disappear
Into a hole In a mountain. The guard
followed on, and found the wild man
had blocked up the entrance " to his
cave with , pieces of timber, and stones,
which, however, .were easily removed
arid the man was captured.
\, He. was absolutely prehistoric in ap
pearance. His only garment was a skin
tied around the hips. His long and
matted : beard fell over, his . chest : like
a cloak, while his hair trailed down
his 'back in a thick mass. In his cave
were : found numerous bones of sheep,
deer arid other animals .which \ he . had
eaten, a sling. , a club and a stone Â¦ ax.
A bed of moss was his only furniture.'
The'; guard brought the troglodyte to
Fuenterrabla, where his appearance
created Â¦ a sensation! Before 'the .mag
istrate he explained "that his name was
Prudencio, he was 28 years old and had
been, when an infant," an inmate of a
f ouridling ';. hospital In San ''.' Sebastian."
He;; had"; formerly acted 'as* farm hand,'
but two years ago, beingunable to find
THE report of the organization at Washington of
"The Navy Relief Society" is ; accompanied by the
announcement: "It has for its purpose to afford re
lief to the widows and orphans of deceased officers, 1 sail
ors and marines of the United States navy. It is an en
tirely new measure, no charitable organization ever hav
ing been incorporated in this country that includes in its
benefits the enlisted force of the navy. It is also its pur
pose to aid in obtaining pensions for those entitled to
them; to obtain employment for those deserving it, and to
solicit and create scholarships and supervise educational
opportunities for orphan chiJvHen."
There will be something of surprise to the public in
the statement that up to this time there has been no
charitable organization incorporated in the United States 1
that includes in. its benefits the enlisted men of' the navy.
American incorporated charities are", so numerous the
impression prevails that they cover every field wjiere
charity is needed and a gobd many where it is' not
needed. The lack of any proper care for the widows and
the orphans .of the enlisted men of the navy is therefore
a matter of more or less public discredit. The'move
ment now being "made toward supplying the need for
such an incorporated charity will of course . be received
with'general approval and ought to find cordial.arid lib

Cal. The following is given as the
method for making a hektograph that,
if allowed to remain for two days after
using, will not need washing, but will
absorb all the Ink and not interfere
with the making of a new transfer:
Soak an ounce of the Cooper gelatine
over night in enough cold water to
cover it well, taking care that all the
gelatine is swelled. Prepare a salt
water bath by dissolving two ounces of
common salt in a pint of water. Heat
seven or eight ounces of glycerine -over
the salt water bath to a temperature
of 200 Fahrenheit. Then pour off from
the gelatine all the water remaining
unabsorbed, add the gelatine to the
hot glycerine, continuing the heating
for an 'hour, carefully stirring the mix
ture occasionally, avoiding a* much as
possible Â¦ the formation of bubbles.
Finally add twenty drops of oil of,
cloves to prevent decomposition.. The
composition is , then ready to pour, into
the shallow tins in which it Is to be
used. After the tin Is filled, It must
remain in a level position for at least
five hours in a cool place before using
for the purpose of making transfers.

Spring in the Campagna.
First April wav'd a milk-white hand
And made new magic in the land.
Now over all the rolling plain
The sweet windflowers bloom . again.
The blossom falls,, the Judas-trees
Unthread their coral rosaries;
The tufted fennels thrust on high
A golden broom to sweep the sky;
And over broken archway flows
The saffron of the budding rose.
Now all the green grass country sings.
Now stirs the sap, and where it springs
A memory-haunted fragrance fills
The Ilex hollows in the hills.
Now, misty seas of borage bloom
En-isle the ruined roadside tomb.
And now as when the world began
The lamb's first cry goes out to Pan.
Now where the winding stream divides
The poplars on its willowed sides.
The white-throat tells his happy tale
And mocks the lingering nightingale. .â¢
Now in the shadows of the glen
Uncurls the timid cyclamen.
And he may find who cares and knows
Wet dips where white narcissus blows;
Now all the warm, caressing air
Breathes violets, violets everywhere. *i
And here, where still the tender touch
Oof slow decay has left so much.
Where centered memories linger round
Each. landmark set in storied ground, .
When spring makes all things fresh and
fair
And felt more keenly, glimpses rare
Of that unfathomed world arise
Which once I saw with childhood's eyes.

GOVERNMENT *RESERVOIRS â A
Newcomer, City. To obtain advice
about Government reservoirs under
construction at the present time ad
dress a communication to the United
States General Land Office, Washing
ton, D. c.
THE United States, at a cost of $50,000,000, has ob
tained a right to construct a canal across the isth
mus of Panama. It is estimated that the total cost
of construction will exceed $140,000,000. Of that sum. a
large amount will be expended for machinery, equipment
and materials that will have to be taken from various
parts of the United States to Panama. The question,
therefore, arises whether the ships that carry the mate
rial shall be American or foreign.
Upon that issue the Cleveland Marine Review makes a
good suggestion. It says:
"An opportunity now presents itself for the canal to
be of immediate benefit to American â¢ shipping. The
canal's zone is the property of the United States wholly
and absolutely by right of purchase. It isxuriderthe ju
risdiction of the American Government and is part and
parcel of the United States of America. Politically it is
territory of the United States, and the navigation laws
of the United States should be immediately extended _to
embrace it. American ship-owners have both a moral
and legal right to demand that the canal zone be in
cluded in the coastwise ' service, which means that all
commerce between one American port an -d another
should be carried by an American ship. The canal is to
be built by American money and American "brain,
through American territory, and the taxpayers of Amer
ica will be called upon to foot the bills, and the material
which American money purchases should be carried to
the canal zone in American ships."
It is difficult to see how any valid objection can be
made to such a plea for American shipping. As the
Marine Review says: "It does* not require any compli
cated legislation, the adoption of any new principle or the
expenditure of any great sum of money, but simply the
extension of a well-known and universally approved pol
icy upon which all parties in our national Legislature
have been agreed. No more favorable opportunity
could^ arise to fulfill some of the many promises and
pledges so frequently made for many years by the party
in power than the one indicated,"

Proof Positive.
The wonderful resources in arriving
at facts outside of evidence as is sub
mitted before courts of justice was one
of the characteristics of the late bril
liant Hall McAllister, who stood at
the head of his profession in California.
It was during a case involving fhe
supposed will of a very wealthv man
who departed this life about ten years
before the final will was presented in
court for probate. The man's estate
was worth several millions of dollars
and as a consequence there was a
contest over its admission. to probate.
The will, or what was supposed to
be his will, when introduced in the
old Probate Court over which Judge
Myrick presided, looked all right. The
witnesses to the last document swore
to the genuineness of the paper. This
was apparently conclusive, and, fur
thermore, - Hall McAHJster, who ap
peared for # the contestants, had no evi
dence to offer as to its crookedness.
The other side was represented by the
firm. of Sham & Sharp, who were also
great lawyers.
When the case was presented Sol
Sharp leaned back . in his chair and
with one of his winsome smiles looked
Hall McAllister In the face and re
marked, "Hall, ,we got you this time."
McAllister returned the Jeer j in his
usual way and, picking up the will,
addressed the court as follows:
"As to the genuineness of this docu
ment of course there can be but lit
tle doubt, as it is more than supported
by sworn evidence. But, unfortunately
for the claimants, the paper contain
ing this will was not ; made until five
years after the date of the will in
scribed thereon."
Having delivered this shot, he picked
up the paper anrf, holding it between
himself and the light before a window,
pointed out the water imprint woven
therein with the date of the manufac
ture. â¢ Â«/
This settled the claimants' spurious

THE CALL is glad to enroll the beautiful town of
Alameda in the list of progressive communities. Its
Â¦ situation is excellent from every point., of view.
Originally built on a peninsula, since the completion of
the tidal canal it is on an island. This may some
thing to do with its new spirit of local patriotism, for all
insular people are patriotic. They have a keen sense of
the advantages of climate and we are glad to observe
that they first rallied around the palm by planting that
,tree on the borders of their public grounds.
As a palm island Alameda rfeed have no superior in the
Union, for the climate is peculiarly clement and suited to
tropical flora. They keep Arbor day and devote it to
planting more palms and other tropical trees. This year
they very appropriately select April 22 for Arbor day. It
is the anniversary of the birth of J. 'Sterling Morton, the
founder of Arbor day. He is at rest on the far banks of
the Missouri, and^above his tomb and around are groves
planted by his hand to beautify the pririesof Nebraska.
Nearly sixty years ago, when he pioneered the country
west of the Missouri, Alameda was unknown. But now its
place on the map is made beautiful by applying his motto,
"Plant trees," and his memory is to be kept and honored^
by his appreciative countrymen far from the immediate
scene of his labors.
â¢ Alameda has certain peculiar advantages in her s,hore
line. It is divided between that which is demanded for
commerce, on the west and north, and that which is dedi
cated to aquatic pleasures, bathing,, rowing and sailing,
on the south and east. The whole island can be so
beautified as to make it unnecessary to sail south of the
equator to find "the beautiful isles." When the various
associations that are now federated for advancement
have been a little while in action, it will the
island that incited the mutineers of the ship Bounty to
rise against the authority of their officers, and put her
about for palm-covered Pitcairn.
With San Jose.. Oakland and San Francisco in line and
in league to adopt all the gifts and graces possible in this
climate of charms, on. the bay and coast, and Sacramento,
Marysville, Fresno and others in the valley of California
doing the same, the State will rapidly become the show
place nature intended when its soil was placed on the
bed rock and its sun was hung in the heavens.
One of the objections-'to the motor
car is its tendency to raise thick clouds
uf dust from the highways over which
it passes. Fuh"y recognizing this evil,
the London Automobile Club caused an
inquiry to be instituted, under the su
pervision of Colonel Crompton, C B.
The cycJe track at the Costal Palace
was , selected as the theater of opera
tions, and a portion of the track was
covered with the sweepings from a
flour mill, which were raked over and
renewed between each test. It was
soon discovered; however, that the eye
was not capable of estimating fairly
the great difference which existed In
the dust-raising proclivities of differ
ent cars, and the camera was enlisted
as recording officer with the most sat
isfactory results. Two cameras were
employed, and the cars were photo
graphed by them simultaneously as
they traveled past at various speeds.
These photographs show that while
certain cars are very dusty ones others
raise no more dust than a horse-drawn
vehicle. From these experiments it
would seem that the amount of dust
does not so much depend upon the kind
of tire employed as upon the amount
of space below the car. If this is quite
unimpeded by. hanging gear^ or in any
other wav the dust raised is not con

Â¦been primed here, that the horrible
OiarzLrtrr of the conflict is revealed.
At th* outbreak of the rebellion the
negroes surprised and massacred hun

practiced such terrible cruelties on
ir.en. wotzici) End children aJike that
the worst deeds of North American
Indians appear tame by comparison.
Instead of killing their victims out
right the savages in most instances
i*ubjpcted them to the most atrocious
torture their fiendish malice could de
vise. ILiet, including women and
children- were flayed alive. Some .had
their limbs chopped off. first their arms
t:nd then their legs, and ihose who
Ftill survived had their eyes poked out.
Parents were frequently bound hand
and foot and in this helpless position
1 ompelled to see their children slowly
tortured to death and their lifeless
I'odies afterward subjected to horrible
mutilation. Women were hung upon
trees, head downward, and beaten to
death. The negroes frequently nailed
hands, feet, and other fragments of
the bodies of those they had butchered
lo the walls of their homes. -. .T
One woman. Frau Schumann, the
ravages beheaded and they stuck the
head on the roof of her house. With
a ghastly touch of humor they after

The colonist who relates this inci
dent records with satisfaction that
one man. after being wounded, had
Ftrer.frth enough to blow out his brains
and thus escaped the death by tor
ture which had been reserved for him.
Another man was beaten until out
raped nature came to his relief and he
lopt consciousness. His barbarous cap
tors then fired two bullets into him and
feeling sure that they had killed him
stripped hip clothing from him and left
his body, as they thought, to be de
voured by Jackals. But he recovered
consciousness and despite his 'terrible
injuries and the bitter cold managed
to crawl several miles to Windhoek,
the nearest settlement.

real nature of our black brothers,"
writes one colonist, Adolph Tcuebener.
to a relative here. "They are not men,
but wild beasts. Words fail me to
describe the cruelties they practiced
on our countrymen, on helpless women
and children. Farmers who fell into
their hands in this district were tor
tured to death and their bodies were
mutilated, their arms being cut off
with axes. The women were treated
still more cruelly.
"Frau Lange saw her husband done
to death and was then compelled to
watch her four-year-old child butcher
ed. The Hereros placed the child in
a doorway and slammed the heavy
door until the life was crushed out of
the body. I could relate hundreds of
cases equally horrible. In the immedi
ate neighborhood of Okahandja alone
113 persons were tortured to death.
Ood grant that some of these . black
demons may fall into our hands. There
will be prim revenue then."
According to authentic German re
ports that grim revenge is being ex
acted whenever the opportunity oc
curs, "Vorwaerts" declares that the
methods adopted by the German troops
are no better than those of the He
reros; that they shoot down men,
women and children indiscriminately
and after the engagements dispatch
the wounded.
That this statement is no exaggera
tion is shown by a letter from Dr.
Baumgart. a volunteer with the Ger
man troops, who openly rejoices in the
v.ar of extermination they are waging
and the part he has played In it.
â¢ "No quarter is given." he writes; "the
enemy are ruthlessly shot down, for
our feelings are very bitter against
these savages. We found a number of
Hereros installed at the Hoffnung
farm, but when they saw our approach
they abandoned all their belongings
and fled. We. however, hotly pursued
them and succeeded in cutting off four
teen fugitives, who were speedily" shot
or beaten to death.
"Another fugitive, separated from
the main group, received two bullets
from my Browning pistol, which
wounded him. He crawled into the
bush, but 1 sprang off my horse and.
finding the spot where he lay, beat
Mm on the head with the butt end of
my rifle until his skull was shattered.
"I wounded another Herero with
two pistol phots, and as he lay on. the
ground another of our men came up
and smashed his skull with a rifle shot
which he fired at close . range."

German Officers? Cruelty.
Special Cbrrae^oBdeaor.
BERLIN, Aiail 4. â Cases have been
few of late* In which the result of a
military court-martial In this country
has satisfied the public, but no such de
cision has called for fiercer denuncia
tion than that by which Prince Prosper
von Arenberg, previously sentenced to
death for a fiendishly cruel murder, has
been acQultted on the ground of insan
ity and committed to the municipal
hospital at Herxberge. The general
feeling Is that this titled assassin has
got off as the result of "influence" and
that the authorities once more have
played straight Into the hands of the
Socialists by giving a further Jolt to
the confidence of the masses In those
â¢who govern them.
It may be remembered that the mur
der for which German law now con
siders the Prince irresponsible was
committed nearly four years ago in one
of Germany's Southwest African colo
nies, â¢whither the officer had gone 'with
Ms regiment, the' victim being a half
breed policeman named Kain. The
murderer was sent back to Germany
for trial, and It was the court-martial
then appointed to try him which in
September, 1900, sentenced the prisoner
to death. His aristocratic friends im
mediately set to work In his behalf,
and the court-martial just closed was
the result of three years' effort to
have the original decision set aside.
In any ordinary court, one would
think, the testimony as to criminal In
clinations and general viciousness on
the part of Von Arenberg from his
boyhood would have gone a long way
toward overbalancing the insanity plea.
It was stated by Â¦witnesses that he used
to attack his teachers; that he caught
cats and after cutting off their feet set
dogs upon them, and two of his favor
ite pastimes as a small boy were said
to consist of biting the tail of his dog
and cutting the eyes from living fish.
Nor did the brutality of his charac
ter lessen when the young noble was
graduated from a military training
school into a lieutenancy in the army.
He was known as the champion drink*
er of. his regiment and, drunk, or
sober, made a regular practice of
beating and ill-treating his men. Like
most bullies too, he was a coward.
Among the witnesses at both trials
was the surgeon attached to the ship
which carried the Prince's regiment
to Africa, and the doctor described
how the Prince rushed on deck during
a capful of wind, wearing only a life
belt and begging to be saved In case
the ship should be wrecked.
At the military station he soon be
came known as "The Crazy Prince."
According to the testimony of eye wit
nesses, Prince Prosper was on excel
lent terms with Kain, the half-breed
policeman, his subsequent victim, of
ten drinking with him and treating
him with a familiarity which disgust
ed his other acquaintances at the fort.
One day, however, the Prince, who
had been away from the camp, return
ed, declaring that the half-breed had
threatened his life and that he after
ward had made off intent on escaping
into English territory. So Von Aren
bergr, taking a detail of soldiers, start
ed out to round up Kain, the soldiers
having strict orders to shoot should
the half-breed resist arrest. The po
liceman gave himself up at once, how
ever, and after making prisoners of
all Kain's family, Prince Prosper,' as
jury and Judge, examined him.
During all the accusations the po
liceman declared his intention of ap
pealing his case to the colonel of the
regiment. To this the "crazy Prince"
agreed, promising to take him before
the superior officer next day. Then,
to all appearances, he became uracious
again, allowing Kain to sit about the
camp fire and drink with him. Pre
viously, however, the Prince had or
dered the soldiers' to shoot Kain if he
tried to escape and when the police
man made no attempt to get away the
cowardly officer tried in various ways
to make him leave the camp.
Finally, according to an eye wit
ness, Kain arose and walked away af
ter the Prince had spoken to him in
English.' Then the Prince ordered a
sentry to shoot him, because he was
trying to escape. â¢ At the second com
mand to fire the soldier shot Kain in
the leg, so enraging the Prince that, he
ran up with drawn revolver and shot
the native in Ihe head.

Coast Women's Association are just now having

THE Democratic managers hr New York have their
pockets stuffed with personal attacks on the Presi
dent. . While the different factions are at war on
xnatters of party policy, they all agree that abuse of the
President is party expediency. Among the preliminary
reports one idea is said to be common to all subdivisions.
The supporters of Hearst and of Parker and the clans of
Tammany and the. upstarters all. agree that the President'
is to be made odious, and painted black, if brush and pot
can do it.
Oddly enough they propose to do this by contrasting
him with McKinley. They think of declaring that since
the death of McKinley the Republican party has run riot,
with Roosevelt at the head of the disturbance, and that it
has failed to carry out the promise that McKinley's poli
cies should be continued. This is interesting. It is a
pledge that if McKinley had lived the Democratic party
would have died in his arms, passing to a glorious resur
rection in Republicanism. Or it implies that if his-poli
cies had survived the Democracy would now be support
ing his successor.
One is at a loss to characterize politics of that kind.
No President since Lincoln has been so much abused for
his policies in his lifetime as McKinley. Mr. Hearst is a
leading candidate for the Presidential nomination. This
candidate said in his paper, a' few months before McKin
ley's assassination : ' "The President of the United States
is commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the
United States. The trusts control the present command
er-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States.
It may be near, it may be far, but in a not remote winter
the American peasant will walk by a window of the
White House. It will have been some hard winterâ a
winter with the coal trust, a winter with the gas trust, a
winter with the beef trust, a winter with the clothing trust.
A white, fat hand will toss its answer out of the window,
'A trust can do no wrong.' Then the commander-in
thicf of the army and navy will issue proclamations, as
to the protection of property, and other proclamations;
he will call out his army and his navy, and there will be
an awful, bloody quarrel between the commander-in-chief
and the peasants."
Continuing in the same editorial, Mr. Hearst drew a
picture of the beginning of the French revolution, closing
with this: "In a few years all the peasants in France
were eating, but the King was dead. So when we hint
that this republic is in danger now, just remember what
a short time intervened between the King alive and
drinking, and the King dead and the peasants all eating."
Now with an amazing effrontery the party in whose be
half that incendiary and murderous stuff was published
proposes to make a personal issue against Roosevelt' for
not carrying out the policy of his predecessor, whose
assassination was invited by its leading newspaper or
gans, the property of a candidate for its nomination!
The policy of McKinley was a protective tariff, with
such reciprocity as would promote and not destroy our
domestic industries; it was for an isthmian canal, pre
ferring the Panama route, if the complications could be
cleared away; it was for a navy adequate to the needs of
a nation with the longest coast line in the world and
with the greatest amount of property exposed to^con
quest in cities on that line; it was for such influence as
this republic may legitimately have in the politics of the
world, without entangling alliances.
All of these have been projected and promoted faith
fully b;- President Roosevelt. The greatest "economic
feature of them all is the canal. He has gone forward on
the McKinley line, and has the canal ready for construc
tion, though opposed at every step by the Democratic
leaders. He has instituted and won suits against every
trust that has been impeached for illegality. Con
gress put into his hands a fund for that purpose amount
ing to a half million. By the expenditure of only $25,000
of that sum he has broken the back of the trusts, and
through the courts has secured a line of decisions that
wall in the whole system of combination of capital, set
bounds to it, and arrest it at the line where popular
rights begin. V,*"*."'
It will be a spectacle for gods, and men to see Hearst
and Hill crocodiling over McKinley, and weeping that
his policies have not been carried out, remembering that
Hill accused him of destroying the constitution, and
Hearst. said of him: "AfcKinley's speech proves that at
the head of this nation there is a dull brain. It is a milk
and water brain. Within it there is no conception of the
exalted station held by a man chosen to lead a great na
tion. The brain that plotted, planned and begged for the
place, the brain- that gladly accepted the advice, money
and domination of a Hanna to creep into the White
House, cannot conceive of .any mental operations supe
rior to the plotting, planning and submissive order."
Read that and then measure the size of these, men who
are blackwashing Roosevelt for not, as they say, follow
ing in McKinley 's footsteps! ." "
His Beauty.

Frank Todd, growing reminiscent the
other night, "poor old 'Smoker Bill' was

, "Bill was kind of heart and prided
himself on his good looks^ though at

Bill, 'I'm going to kill you.'
" Til give you what I- have," the man
pleaded, 'but please don't hurt me.'
" 'Your money is no good to me,' re

I ever ran across a man* as homely

" 'Now, stranger,*' came the answer,
'turn loose your old cannon, and I hope
that you are a good shot, because if
I am as homely a looking brute as you
I want to 'croak.' Â¦

MEN AND MATTERS IN

MOVES
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES"Chow Chow" Is the enlightening
title cf the new burlesque at Fischer's.
The audience last night was quite en
thusiastic over some of the music.
Some of the Jokes may well be omitted
at future performances. Helen Russell
won more applause than any of the
other stage people. In fact her voice
is probably the main attraction at
Fischer's- Richard F. Carroll made
most of the fun. Nellie Lynch had a
bad cold, but looked pretty and sang
measurably well, in spite of It. The
book reeks vlth racetrack slang. The
costumes are reÂ»lly quite fine. A some
what unsoldierly but nevertheless
pretty military drill Is a feature of the
niece.
Fischer's.
The book was written by George M.
Cohan, and the whimsical spirit of his
authorship was reflected in his acting
of the leading part. To describe his
method would be no less difficult a task
than to review the marvelous compli
cations la which he plunged his char
acters, and then deftly, disentangled
them. His comedy style, is absolutely
distinctive and the quiet naturalness
of his parents and sister contribute
mightily toward Its effectiveness". The
quartet work together as . > no' equal
number of player folk ever harmonized.
Young Mr. Cohan composed the mu
sic, also, but it Is of secondary value.
' That remarkable family of fun
makers, the Four Cohans, provoked
more hilarity in the Columbia Theater
last evening than the oldest habitue
of the house had ever heard at a single
sitting. The middle act of their mu
sical comedy, "Running for Office," left
the big and fashionable audience so
fatigued with laughing that an Imme
diate repetition would certainly have
proved homicidal. Men and women
fairly screamed while the curtain was
up, and when it fell they just lay back
limply In their seats and silently Jol
lied as they thought it over.
Saying that Is not Insinuating that
either the first or final act was bar
ren of fun. Indeed the entire piece
fairly bristled with snappy lines, hu
morously quaint characterization and
side-splitting .situations. But the
clean and keen wit of the Initial act
was merely a sort of gradual prepara
tion for the uproarious Jollity of the
second section and the third \ was a
merciful tapering off to a giggling
finish.

"The Beggar Student" entered upon
Its second week at the Tivoli Opera
house last night. *
SAN JOSE. April IS. â Southern Pacific de

Â¦were entered by burglars last night, but noth
ing of value was taken.
The Central Theater resounded with
enthusiastic cheers and applause last
night, when the heroic climaxes of the
American naval drama "The "White
Squadron" gent patriotic thrills
through the'erowded house. The spec
tacular scene of the congress of the
navies was splendidly effective. Brit
ish, French, Russian, German and Jap
anese warships In full sail were repre
sented, and finally the matchless white
ships floating the stars and stripes
glided Into view and fired salutes. The
landing of the sailors of the various
nations made a fine sight, and the bold
defiance breathed by the American
commander, protected by his squad
ron's guns in the harbor of Rio Janeiro,
roused the audience to a thunderous
expression of approbation. The great
play is expensively staged, with a cast
of more than 100 people. Herschell
Mayall, as the Yankee captain who
gallantly champions the cause of his
mistreated countrymen in Brazil, was
a hero par excellence, while Henry
Shumer as the Brazilian officer who
sells his honor for gold and Ernest
Howell as a coconspirator were typical
dissembling villains. Lloyd Edwards
played with merit the most pretentious
role he has yet essayedâ that of the
Brazilian general; and Edwin T. Em
ery was good as a noble young Bra
zilian fighting for love and honor. El
mer Booth put a great deal of vim into
the part of a newspaper correspondent,
and George Nicholls created a striking
scene as a slave, who appears l yoked
to an ox until his freedom is purchased
by an American. Eugenia Thais Law
ton and Edna Ellsmere won honors In
the roles of two beautiful Brazilian girls,
whose affairs of the heart and loving
sacrifices figure prominently in the
story. Myrtle Vane and Helen Hart
ley have pleasing comedy parts. The
scenery is very picturesque, and "The
White Squadron" is a pronounced hit
at the Central.

The comedy "The Frisky Mrs. John
son," by Clyde Fitch, was presented at
the Alcazar Theater last night to a
crowded house. That the clever stock
company scored a success was ap
parent from the rise of the curtain
until its fall. There was no occasion,
except in one instance, for , the
prompter's services, and everything
went along smoothly. The play has
been seen here before, but this was the
first time for its production by a stock
company. - The humor is spontaneous
and the risible faculties of the audi
ence are kept in full play, but there is
running through the piece the effect
of a flirtation that nearly ends in a
tragedy.
Mis's Adele Block in the title role was
all that could be desired, artistically
and otherwise. Her deep love for her
younger sister and her sacrifice to save
her from the wrath of her husband
were cleverly portrayed. Miss Frances
Starr as the erring sister, Mrs. 'Frank
Morley, shared . the Â¦ honors with Miss
Block. She was natural throughout
and carried the sympathies of the
audience with her. James Durkin as
Jim Morley. who falls in love with Mrs.
Johnson, had an excellent conception
of the part and Luke Conness as Frank
Morley, the injured husband, was ef
fective. The last scene in which these
four participated, when the young wife
confesses her faults, was worked out
to a climax that literally brought down
the house. John B. Maher as Lord
Bertie Heathcore supplied the great
er part of the fun and he was inimi
table. He was ably seconded by Harry
S. Hilliard as Lai Blrkenhead; George
Os bourne as Count Max Dindeau; Miss
Juliet Crosby as Mrs. Bowler; Miss
Marie Howe as Mrs. Chardley; John
E. Hines as Professor Chardley and.
Walter Belasco as Mr. Bowler. The
scenery is excellent and the dresses of
the ladies are superb.

Bishop Hamilton is expected to ar

Kansas, where he has been conducting
the spring conferences of the Metho
dist Episcopal church. Bishop Hamil
tion will be practically the leader of
the great missionary conference which
begins here April 28.
Ballington Booth will speak before
the San Francisco Evangelical Union,

noon, April 25.
Dr. II. L. Bridgman, president of
Hamlin University, and a prominent
member of the General Conference,
which will open at Los Angeles may
4, attended the Methodist ministers'
meeting yesterday and received a cor
dial welcome.
*Dr. W. 11. White, president of the
association, reported that he and a
committee composed of T. D. Butler
and A. C. McKeever visited the Berke
ley Bible Seminary last week, where
they found 175 studying in two Bible
classes. Intense earnestness was ob
served in the students.
He stated in reply to a question by
the Rev. Mr. Bevier that there are 35,
000 Italians in San Francisco, though
in Borne quarters they are estimated
as reaching as high as 40,000.
Dr. Francis M. Larkin, pastor of
Grace Methodist Episcopal Church,
discussed the system of the Methodist
church government in view of the
coming session of the General Confer
ence in Los Angeles. The argument
taken was that the episcopacy, with
an office limited to eight years, a pre
siding eldership, limited to six years
out of twelve, and an unlimited pas
torate would tend to a greater effi
ciency of the church.
A meeting of the Baptist Ministers*
Association was held yesterday after
noon, when a paper on "The Bible as
a Record of Religious Experience"
was read by Professor Day, D. D., of
San Anselmo. The Baptist ministers
will meet next Monday at Napa.
R. Waggoner met the Christian
church ministers at their weekly
meeting yesterday afternoon, when a
strong discussion took place on the ne
cessity of encouraging young men to
look toward the ministry instead of
the professions and trades.
Members were unanimous in their
decision to begin to influence the most
suitable young men for the ministry.
Two young men on the previous night
voluntarily gave their names to Mr.
"Waggoner as applicants for the min
istry-
Dr. Abbott had been accused of be
ing of Unitarian tendencies in his con
ception of Christ, and in meeting that
assertion the Rev. Mr. Rader said it
was a metaphysical rather than a the
ological question. He held that Dr. Ab
bott believed In the divinity of Christ,
but did not attempt to explain it meta
physically. His Christ, said the Rev.
Mr. Rader, is a natural and helpful
reality. . Â¦
The Theological Seminary then re
ceived the Rev. Mr. Rader's congratu
lations for â¢ bringing the eminent
teacher to the coast, which caused
him to feel more than ever that the
Congregational world is a theological
unit. Dr. W. C. Pond. Dr. S. H. Wil
ley. Dr. Joseph Rowell and Dr. Frear
joined in the discussion that followed.
Pietro Sbrocco, missionary of the
Cross, appeared before the Presbyte
rian ministers* meeting yesterday and
gave an account of his work among
the Italians.
Rev. Mr. Rader held that what they
were discussing was not the individual
only,* but a theological movement and
a religious tendency of which he con
sidered Dr. Abbott was the most emi
nent exponent in the United States.
The reverend gentleman reminded his
brother ministers that some years ago
the Presbyterian Occident questioned
his views on the Bible, and it was Dr.
Lyman Abbott who came to his rescue
in the Outlook when every minister in
the West remained silent.
Rev. Mr. Rader said also that Dr.
Abbott had been the defender of every
minister that wished the freedom of
his religious conviction. "Indeed," said
the reverend gentleman. "Dr. Abbott is
a defender of the faith." What he
meant by the authority of the ministry
was really the testimony of truth in
his own consciousness.
Dr. Lyman Abbott's lectures before
the Pacific Theological Seminary were
the subject of discussion by the mem
bers of the Congregational Ministers'
Association, which met in the Young
Men's Christian Association building
yesterday morning. Rev. William
Rader presided and the attendance was
large.
Opinion was divided as to the ortho
doxy of Dr. Abbott, tome going so far
as to say that his views on the divinity
of Christ and the Bible are inharmo
nious with Congregational belief. While
disagreeing with certain views of the
eminent divine and teacher, those that
oppose his modern interpretation paid
high tribute to the doctor's "beautiful
spirit and courage as an interpreter,"
as well as to the general helpfulness of
his lectures.

The committee adopted a resolution
offered by Charles Sonntag, in which it
indorsed the policy of President Roose
velt and pledged to him its support.
In it* preamble the paper asked that
the Republicans of this county har
monize and stand together under the
leadership of its regularly and legally
constituted authorities, and that in
every Assembly district there be con
stituted a committee cf eleven, to be
known as "the Republican Committee
of the Assembly District," which shall
consist of the five members of the
County Committee representing the
respective Assembly districts and six
additional Republican residents of the
district to be appointed by the chair
man of the County Committee. It was
further advised that the duties of the
committees of eleven shall be subject
to the control and authority of the
County Committee, which is to take
charge of the organization.
The resolution further provided that
a committee of eighteen, one from each
AssemMy\ district, be appointed as a
committee on by-laws and rules for
the government of the County Com
mittee, to report at the next meet
in? of the committee.

PASO ROBLES, April 18.â About 100
members of the Medical Society of the
State of California met here this morn
ing, and lOfrvmore are expected on this
evening's train. The committee met
each morning train and escorted the
visitors to their apartments.
The president, Dr. H. Bert Ellis, First
Vice President W. Al Flint, Second Vice
President George A. Hare, Secretary
D. G. H. Evans and other officers are

The State, county and municipal san
itary conference of California held its

tin Regensburger of San Francisco gave
all a very hearty greeting at the morn
ing session, after which Dr. James W.
Ward of San Francisco read an inter
esting paper on food adulteration. Dr.
George H. Aiken of Fresno spoke on
milk supply and sanitation of the dairy.
At the afternoon session several very
fine papers were' read and discussed
by Dr. Edward von Adelung of Oak
land, Dr. William Simpson of San Jose,
Dr. O. Stansbury of Chico and Hon. W.
I. Foley of Los Angeles. Dr. Ross of
Sacramento spoke of the pollution of
public water supplies.
The evening, session was addressed by
Dr. C. C. Browning of Highland and
Dr. Mary R. Butin of Madera. The
speeches were limited to five minutes
and discussion of all papers was in
vited.

by Gustave Hinrichs, and sunk below
the level of the audience a la Bey
reuth, gave the prelude. The second
curtain then rose to disclose a pair in
red velvet with the "Isabel Irving"
legend upon them, and these parted to
discover Mayor Schmitz, solus, in a
garden scene.
"It is strange, yet not so strange â
considering my long acquaintance with
the profession (laughter and cheers)
âthat I should have been chosen to
dedicate this temple or the drama,"
Mayor Schmitz decided, then hoped
that the theater would always deserve

Important function of christening the
new theater. Miss Irving was equally
successful in her role, though charm
ingly nervous. She came almost shyly
to the center of the stage, to a huge
bed of California poppies arranged
there, and with the simple words, "I
christen thee Majestic," broke the bap
tismal Muram over the prows of the
new theater. And it- was all over.
There were still some delays then
before the play began, a refractory
light with two electricians and a ladder
playing star parts. And then the
house was. flash-lighted and photo
graphed, and after that "The Crisis."
That "The Crisis" began to interest
immediately on its own merits speaks
very well for it. and. Indeed, Mr.
Churchill has made a neat, compact,
clear and .thoroughly interesting little
play from his book. The situations are
familiar, the characters familiar, the
incidents even -familiar, but they are
freshly treated and hung together in
deft and convincing fashion, and Mr.
Churchill's dialogue is unusually happy.
As Virginia Carvel. Miss Irving stars
in very winsome fashion. She has a
sufficient Southern tinge in her ac
cent, and brings a charming gayety
and girlishness to the role. She has
spirit, too, and looks the part most
fetchingly.
The theater promises to be- one of
the prettiest in town, with its spacious
orchestra and two graceful balconies.
They have been lucky with the
acoustics, too, every seat in the house
offering good hearing, and also an ex
cellent view of the stage. Not unim
portantly the seats themselves are as
comfortable as they make them. Par
ticularly effective, too, are the lighting
arrangements, and throughout the com
fort, convenience and safety of the
patrons of 'the theater seem to have
been lavishly consulted.
The audience had plenty of time to
take in these things before the curtain
went up to disclose Mayor Schmitz,
who dedicated the new temple of the
drama. At S:30 o'clock the. iron
curtain lifted to disclose a handsome
The "greatest show town" in the
United States, as the players call San
Francisco, received last night an im
portant reinforcement to its show
places in the new Majestic Theater,
thrown open to the public last evening,
with "The Crisis" as the initial attrac
tion. The house-warming was perhaps
a little premature, but Manager Bish
op's heroic efforts to get the house into
shape for its promised opening were
warmly complimented on all hands.
The foyer, handsome and spacious, is
still in the lath and plaster/ stage, but
palms and huckleberry hide its defi
ciencies. The concrete foundation of
the floors is yet covered only with
cheesecloth, and the walls are still of
the plaster tints. But the large audi
ence gathered last night found only
admiration for the varied beauties of
the new theater and a practical reas
surance of its safety in the evidence
offered by the exposed materials of the
theater's construction.
As a show for laughing purposes,
"Running for Office" 'fills every inch of
the bill. â¢
It Is his construction and logical dis
solution of complicated situations that
constitute his greatest worth as a pro
ducer of entertainment.
Aside from the Cohans, there is a
big company of ' people who evidently
were enlisted with a particular view
to their fitness for the roles respect
ively assigned them, and there is a
large and pretty and \vocally clever
chorus. The plot as a whole is rather
impossible, but the sub-plots are so
numerous and clever as to make one
cease attempting to find coherence in
the main story.

The preliminary examination of
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin on the charge of
murdering Mrs. Ida Henrietta Deane
at Dover, DeU in August, 1898, by
sending a box of poisoned candv to
her sister. Mrs. Elizabeth _ Dunning,
was continued before Police Judge
Conlan' yesterday. The proceedings
were without marked incident.
The cross-examination of Dr. L. H.
Bishop was conducted, and Professor
R. Wolf of Dover, who made an analy
sis of the poisoned candy, and Dr. P.
S. Downs, who was called in to asist
Dr. Bishop, gave their testimony.
Clerk Wells of Judge Cook's court
appeared with exhibits for the Inspec

In many events of a similar nature
there are many athletes entered who
simply go to swell the number \ -and
have no legitimate â¢ chance to finish
first. -Now it is different. There was
no restriction placed on the condftions
to govern. Any that cared to try was
welcomed, but it has so happened that
only the cream of the talent cared to
take their chances this time, and the
result is apparent in the entry lists.
From all-over this State, and Nevada
the best sprinters, jumpers and mus
cular giants are coming to fight for a
place on the team. There is "a world
of talent in each event, and the win
ner will be welcome to journey to ' the
Olympian games, because he will be
the best amateur in his class In the
Golden ( West.
There is a special delight among the
preparatory schools because their
favorites will have an opportunity .to
clash with representatives of Stanford
and Berkeley. ,In academic circles
there have been frequent performances
of more merit than was evidenced in
the last intercollegiate afield day, and
the younger boys are feverishly await
ing the trials when they may face the
sprinters and jumpers from the big
colleges. In more than one instance
they seem to have a good chance to
snatch the laurels from their elders,
and even the great Abadie may fall be
fore Cope, the Lick champion, at the
100-yard dash. If Cope fails there is
yet the clever sprinter Cadogan to ac
count for, and Abadie may have' to go
under 10 seconds to retain his place on
the team. The same may be said* of
Stanford's crack, Dunn. In the 220
yard dash and the quarter-mile sprint
Cadogan must be looked after, with
a string of lesser lights* from local
schools as dangerous factors.
The Nevada State University will
have a team on hand; Bakersfield High
School will send its champion; two
great athletes are due from Southern
California and Santa Clara High
School will have its colors in several
contests. With all the local wonders
in line, the affair will be of. great in
terest apart from the prize trip the
boys are seeking. A full list of entries
will be given out, Wednesday.
The special games committee of the
Pacific Athletic Association has whip
ped its affairs into . shape, and the
prospects for the greatest field day
ever held on the Pacific Coast are
very bright. Herbert Hauser, George
James and D. E. Brown are acting on
this committee, and they have arranged
for the final try-outs to select a team
togo to the World's Fair at St. Louis
in the fall. This event will take place
on Saturday- next on the Berkeley oval,
and the entries received presage a gen
uine contest in every one of the twelve
events carded. ";'...
"It gives me great pleasure to ad
dress this assembly of Britt admirers,
but I must admit that I am Just a little
bit jealous of the small champion. I
fear that after having attached to his
belt the scalps of all he has met in the
prize ring he may now attempt to gain
new laurels In a production of 'Mac
beth.' However and withal, I must ad
mit that like unto the Star-Spangled
Banner, James Edward's hair still
waves on top. Here's to him."
At this Juncture Webster presented
the token of admiration to the guest
of honor. Britt arose and said:
"Gentlemen, rather friends: I can
not say that this presentation is a sur
prise to me, as the affair has been pub
lished in the papers for some days. I
am, however, greatly surprised and
gratified at the beauty and value of
the gift. But let me say right here,
friends: it Is not the value of this
watch that pleases me, nor is It the
beauty of It. I feel deeply grateful to
think that on the eve of my departure
I have so many friends that will get
together and show me that they are
sorry I am going away.
"When I^flrst went into the fighting
game I was presented with a loving
cup, upon which was engraved the
names of those who gave it. As I look
around this evening I see the same
friends whose names are on that cup.
and they are the nucleus of a founda
tion that has made my way easy to
what you may call success. Gentle
men, I thank you, and am sincerely
grateful .to you for this reception."
The Britts have altered their plans
considerably and have decided to post
pone their departure until Thursday.
As usual, Billy Jordan opened the
ceremonies last evening and, after a
brief address, in which he toasted
Jimmy Britt "as the gamest little
champion in all ringdom," . he said:
"Let all be merry and have as good a
time as possible. Let 'er go!"
George Webster, actor from the Cen
tral Theater, was the next to speak.
Rising majestically and with a aweep
of the arm that would do justice to a
second Booth, he said:
The crowd was a merry one, and had
not been seated long before laughter
and the tinkling of glasses held full
sway. \ -
One of the most pronounced features
of the banquet was Brother Willie's
new gray plaid suit. It is of decidedly
summer effect and is warranted to
lower the colors of any old theatrical
manager that Willie may run up
against.
The fact that Jimmy Britt Is not
wanting in friends was proven last
night, when a hundred or more got
together and dined him, wined him and
presented him with a handsome gold
watch, upon which was his monogram,
inlaid with diamonds, sapphires and
rubies.

WILD THROW LOSES
A GAME FOR QUAKERS
( The Police Committee was directed
to investigate Eggers' charges against
the Pacific Association. - '
Kggers said that Judge Murasky
had decided that the ordinance is in
valid, requiring, as it. does, clubs to
be members of the Pacific Association,
and charged further that the organi
zation had itself violated the amateur
rules. This charge E. I. Lynch of the
association denied, and said it had
been made as~a pretext to secure per
mits by clubs that had been expelled
from the association for breaking the
rules. .
Boxton said that the Lincoln Club
brought all the trouble on by giving a
so-called amateur exhibition in which
professionals appeared in six-round
bouts.
The resolutions granting the Lin
coln and Hayes Valley clubs amateur
boxing permits for April 19 and 26, re
spectively, were adopted by the Board
of Supervisors. Boxton renewed his
objections to the permits because the
club3 were not members of the Pacific
Amateur Athletic Association, as the
ordinance provides, and they would
either have to join the association or
the ordinance would have to be
amended. . .

TWO AMATEUR BOXIXG
PERMITS ARE GRANTED
The Reliance Club has changed the
date of its big double card from Fri
day of next week to Wednesday night,
April 27, owing to a conflict of dates
with the Colma Club. This was decid
ed upon yesterday when the boxers
were consulted by wire or in person.
There was no dissenting voice and
Matchmaker George Mahoney made
the change. Rufe Turner and Jack
Cordell will again hold the center of
the stage in the wind-up. The white
lad was not satisfied with the result
of â¢ the last encounter and asked for a
second meeting, which was readily
granted by the club. In order to give
the affair a double importance Rube
Smith and George Brown were signed
to go the same number of rounds as
the main event â fifteen. It will be a
winner-take-all proposition, with a
$250 side bet. Brown saw Smith beat
McConnell and is satisfied with the
arrangement imposed by the Denver
ite. Brown has beaten McConnell
twice and thinks that Smith will be
no harder for him.

KKSUI/T OF THE RACES
IX THE EAST AND SOUTH
The amount subscribed is now near
jly $15,000 and the sum needed is only
! 510.000 over that figure. With the
{new blood Interested among the ama
_ieur athletes it appears but a matter
'of a couple of weeks when the asso
ciation may go to the Park Commis-
Blon and turn over the whole sum nec
essary for the success of the plan.
The late Horace Fletcher, a well
known member of the Olympic Club
tind an enthusiast on athletics, was
the designer in 1S7S of a great ath
rletic field to be built on the site after
'ward occupied by the Bay District
: track. Now the plans of Mr. Fletcher
ere Just about to be realized in the
amphitheater and speed tr*ek In
'<Golden Gate Park, for which the
upertsmen of San Francisco are la
boring so faithfully. The old plans
â¢ covered a wider scope, for they were
Intended to take in every amateur
*port playe<Vn the "United States.
The old plans provided for a mile
trace track surrounding ball, field, ten-
Tr.Is courts, bicycle track and every
conceivable arrangement for further
ance of srood sport. It was the Inten
tion of the Southern Pacific Company
\o foster the scheme at that time, but
a number of complications arose and
It was abandoned. To-day the affair
,'ls about to be consummated in an
ether form.
The fund for which the Amateur
Driving: and Athletic Association is
working was augmented yesterday to
'the extent of something like $2500 by
fPresldent Simpson's special commit
, tee, appointed to call on prominent
!X>ersons and corporations. Most of this
I amount was culled from the real es
[tate dealers, who appreciate the ben
Â«eflt to be derived from a public proj-
! Â«Â»ct of nuch' proporions. Throughout
the week this committee will continue
'its canvass.
Ordinances were finally passed pro
hibiting the use of buildings for im
moral purposes; ordering street work
on Hermann, Buchanan and Lagruna
streets, and regulating' the right of
way of vehicles on. public streets.
The petition of the Pacific Auxiliary
Fire Alarm Company for permission
to lay underground conduits, pipes and
cables was referred to the Street Com
mittee.
The vetoes of the two ordinances
extending the prohibitory limits for
rock crushing and quarrying were or
dered printed once and referred to the
Street Committee. â¢
Supervisor Brandenstein said that
the commercial interests of the city
v;ere suffering because men and even
women' employes were betting on the
races notwithstanding the existing pro
hibitory ordinance.
Supervisor Comte's motion that the
clause permitting pool selling 1 within
the race track for a period of forty
days be stricken out was seconded by
Supervisor MeCIellan. The amendment
if adopted would prohibit pool selling
at any place in this city.
"I thank the Supervisor for second
ing the motion," said fcomte. "I did
not expect it nor do I expect that my
amendment will receive ten votes. I
am unalterably opposed to gambling
on horse races anywhere and point to
the embezzlements, suicides and other
crimes resulting therefrom."
Supervisor Braunhart argued that it
would be futile to close the race track
in this city by prohibiting pool selling
so long as there are race tracks in ad-
Joining counties and the Legislature
fails to pass general prohibitory laws.
Comte's motion to prohibit pool sell
ing everywhere was lost, it receiving
but three votes in favor â Booth, Mc-
Clellan and the mover.
The ordinance prohibiting the selling
of pools and the making of wagers
as principal, agent or otherwise, on
horse races except within the inclosure
of a race track and then only for a
period of forty days in any one year,
was passed to print by the Board of
Supervisors yesterday. The ordinance
is designed to put a stop to the making
of books in cigar and other stores, con
viction under the existing ordinance
being impossible on the plea that the
money is not betted in this city, but is
sent to Oakland, f nd is not betted on
any system of registration.

the first time in the colors of his new
owner, TV. E. Cotton, bu)/as no one
gave him a thought, the odds soared
from 20 to 40 to 1. He was ridden by
McBride, but after breezing 'along be
hind Flaneur for about two-thirds of
the journey assumed the lead and
fairly galloped in five lengths ahead of
Oro Viva, the third choice. Flaneur
ran third. Sheehan on the favorite,
Golden Light, lost his bearings alto
gether.
Not all of the public choices fared so
disastrously, for Oscar Tolle, Bob Ra
gon and StWinnifride stepped over the
winning line at -comfortable odds. The
track was fairly fast, and the usual
large crowd viewed the racing.
Lacking in class, perhaps, the open
ing five-furlong run for mares attract
ed a large and* varied assortment of
equine femininity to the barrier. Maud
Sherwood received the most, support,
her price falling to 3%, and after a
short season in front Maud retired. Her
place as leading lady' was quickly
filled by Suburban Queen, a 7 to 1
chance, with Sherwood up, which won
as she pleased from Dora I aria Poten
tia. Priestlike faded away toward the
close.
Because Holbrook is not a fashion
able rider and somewhat lacking in
steam besides, Oscar Tolle receded from
8 to 5 to 5 to 2 in the betting on the
second number. It proved only a cat
hop for the big washy chestnut, for he
won under reefed sails from Benlash.
It took Wright, astride Judge Voorhies,
some time to awaken to a sense of the
situation, then he dropped along, fin
ishing third.' Royal White ran a mild
race.
Bob Ragon, the favorite, beat Bill
Short a scant head for the two-year
old dash. But for his bad habit of
running out on the turns the latter colt
might have won. This cost him sev
eral lengths, and at the close Sheehan
on the first choice only beat him out
a head. Pirelia ran a close third.
Gloomy Gus and Howard Vance ran
disappointingly.
An air of mystery appears to-hover
over Ada N. Many supposed yesterday
was the day, and the mare closed a
mild favorite for the mile and a six
teenth selling number. She finished
fourth. Crosswaite rushed Isabellita to
the front soon after the start, and at
the wire the mare scored rather easily
from Virgie d'Or and Glenrice.
In the Futurity course sprint, fifth
to be decided; St. Winnifride had a de
cided call in the ring. She had too
much speed for her party, winning
from start to finish. The odds about
Titus receded from 4 to 9, and he was
the runner-up all the way. Yellowstone
beat Shell Mount for show honors.
St. Winnlfride.' winner of the fifth
race, was bid up from 5500 to $900 by
Dan Meek, owner of Titus. J. W. Paint
er, owner of the former mare, there
upon claimed Titus for $S25.
W. E. Cotton purchased Ebony from
the Hamilton stable last Thursday for
$800 cash and $200 additional from the
first purse won by the colt. The three
year-old was started with blinkers on
yesterday and came home in stake
horse fashion.

a Â»-a when the Patterson commenced to drag.
She did not have steam up and when she
struck the Saturn, tide and wind held her*
prisoner across the collier's stout prow. One

Carl Lay, a youth of 15, who while
in the employ of the printing firm of
Mysell-Rollins Company as . a press
boy, lost an arm, is to receive for his
injuries $3500 in cash and permanent
employment with the firm until he is
21 years of age. He will start in at
$30 a month and every six months the
firm will raise his salary 35 a- month.
This agreement is the result of a com
promise of the suit for $10,000 dam
ages brought by Lay against the firm.
The agreement became known yester
day when the legal representatives of
the firm filed in Judge Graham's court
a stipulation in which these facts were
set forth. The damage suit was then
dismissed: â¢..Â¦â¢;-

cludes as follows:
"Now this great loss and Injustice
has been growing worse and worse for
years, and has finally become bo un
bearable that, unless better facilities
are afforded by May 1 of this year, we
will be compelled to charge for the de
layed time at these docks at the rate
of $1 per hour for two-horse trucks and
wagons and 75 cents per hour for one
horse wagons, one hour being allowed
from the time the teams arrive at the
docks to load or unload goods."
The Draymen's Association of this
i city has notified the Pacific Mail Steam
| ship Company and the Oregon Railroad
I and Navigation Company that after
I May 1 all delays An delivery freight
I for which the congested condition of
j the wharves controlled by these cor
| porations is responsible must be paid
: for at a good stiff rate.
For more than a year the draymen
; have been filing complaints with these
corporations. On the wharves of both
I concerns the attempt is being: made to
j handle ten tons of freight where there
I is room for one ton. The freight has
! been handled, but at the expense of
j the draymen, whose teams have been
! more occupied in unremunerative wait
i ing than in the profitable business for
which they are in commission.-
Governor -Pardee anti the- Harbor
Commissioners have 'been appealed to
j by committees representing the Mer
; chants* Association, Manufacturers*
; and Producers' Association, Chamber
j of Commerce, Board of Trade, Dray
j men's Association and others. All pro
jtests were referred to the Harbor Com-
I mission, but all that has been done up
I to date is the letting of a contract to
j build an addition to the seawall. Plans
I for new wharves for the Pacific Mail
{ Company have been prepared, but
i nothing is as yet under way which
promises to relieve the acute conges
tion of the wharf space at present
available.
The draymen in their communication
â¢to the Pacific Mail Company suggest
! that temporary use of other wharves
i be secured pending the construction of
; adequate accommodations.
As an example of what has been jro
j ing on, the dray owners cite their ex
perience on March 3 cf this year. On
that date, they say, teams were in line
for a China steamer at 2:20 p. m. These
teams were delayed until the following
day at 6 p. m., a wait of twenty-seven
and a half hours, for which no extra
compensation was received.

The contempt proceedings brought
against Chief Â¦ Wittman and Captain
Duke by Jean P/>n, proprietor of a
restaurant at 1129 Dupont street, for
violating an Injunction restraining the
police from interfering with' his busi
ness, were dismissed by Judge Cook
yesterday. The Judge held that it had
not been shown that either of the re
spondents knew that the two police
men complained of had been stationed
in front of the restaurant. He "also
held that it would not be a violation
of the injunction for the officers to
stand. across the street and watch, the
people going in and coming out of the
resturant, and if they observed any
one making a practice of going to the
premises in the rear through the res
taurant they could arrest him or her

Prince Pu Lun, the Imperial repre
sentative of the dragon throne, pass
ed his second and last day In this city
yesterday, by driving through Golden
Gate Park to the Cliff House and vis
iting all of the most important. points
of the city.
In the forenoon .the Prince spent, a
few hours in Chinatown, where he was
cordially received by ; the leading mer
chants and business men.
After luncheon the Prince, accom
panied by Wong Kal Kan and several
friends, including the Chinese Consul,
engaged', a carriage for the afternoon
and viewed the most interesting sec
tions ~of the city.
The Prince was deeply
with Golden Gate Park and the
magnificent marine view from the
Cliff House. ThGugh he cannot
speak the English language, he ex
pressed, in purest Manchu dialect, his
delight in the beauty of the greens
and flowers of the park.
From the park the party drove to
the Chutes, where a ' happy hour of.
recreation was spent. Pu Lun wa3
greatly amused at the various attrac
tions at the Chutes and was particu
larly taken by .the chutes themselves.
He could not, however, be persuaded to
ride,* being content with watching
other? enjoy themselves.
The Prince and his party were es
corted by many Chinese to this depot,
where they j took the train for Wash
ington. Pu) Lun said last night, just
before departing, that he greatly ad
mired San Francisco and was loth to
leave. He expressed the hope that it
will not be long before he will again
have the pleasure of stopping here.
A suit for divorce on the ground of
cruelty was filed by Louise G. Dun
nigan against Lawrence A. Dunnigan.
They were married in this city in
April. 18?1. Mrs. Dunnigan charges
that her husband has abused her for
thÂ« last four years. She says that
when she needed his presence at home
he would refuse to stay, but would re
main out until late hours and then
would abuse her. He even struck her,
Fhe says, and once grabbed her mother
by the shoulders and threw her to
the- floor. Sh" avers that he abused
h*Â»r in the present of their three chil

Is Now Serving Eight Years' Term for
Forgery, but Two Charges Are
Still Pendins.
Two cases against Peter "W. McGlade
on indictments for forgery have been
on the calendar of Judge Cook's court
for some years. When they were call
ed yesterday, Attorney George D. Col
lins, on behalf of the defendant,' said
he was ready. District Attorney By
ington answered ready. Some question
arose as to whether the defendant's
presence was necessary and it was de
cided in the negative. The cases were
set for trial on April 25" and an order
was made that the_ defendant be
brought from San Quentin to court on
that day.
It is improbable that the cases will
go to trial on that day* for the District
Attorney says it will require about two
weeks, and the Soeder trial Is perem
torily set'for May 2. ,
While McGlade was bookkseper for
the Street Department in 1898 he was
indicted on four, charges of forgery
and on a charge of obtaining, money
by j false pretenses. He was acquitted
on two of the ! charges, but was con
victed on one after three trials and
sentenced to serve eight years in San
Quentin on/July 13, 1901.
Rosenberg Opposes OJew Trial.
Judge Seawell yesterday made an
order setting aside his 6rder ; granting
a new trial of the suit for annulment
of marriage brought by George Rosen
berg against Bertha Rosenberg, his
daughter-in-law. * Rosenberg obtained
a decree on the ground that at; the
time his son /married the defendant in
the suit he was under age and had not
obtained his parent's consent. V The or
der setting aside the order granting a
rehearing was made on- request of
Rosenberg's attorneys, "who desire an
opportunity ; to make an - argument
against a new trial.
BOEDER'S TRIAL POSTPONED.â When the
case of Leon Soeder." charged with murder, was
called for trial . In ; Judge Cook's â¢ court yester

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION'S.
The letter concludes as follows:
"It seems very pleasant to have this
everlasting enjoyment of rest. I am
an atheist and do not believe in any
religion. PETER NIEDERMEIER."
His second attempt came after the
wound had .been dressed and closed by
the county physician. Neidermeier was
lying apparently unconscious in the
hospital under a guard's care. fHis
right arm and hand were hidden by the
bedclothing, and with hardly a discern
ible motion he slipped the bandages off
his left arm and with his sharp finger
nails tore away the threads in the
wound. He unconsciously uttered
a groan and made a convlusive
movement, which attracted .the
attention of . the ' physicians, nurses
and the guard, and on throw
ing back the coverlids the attend
ant saw with horror that Neidermeier
had torn away the bandages and re
opened the wound. Neidermeier opened
his eyes and with a leering, wan smile
exclaimed: "Let me die, Doc. Go away
and let me die. You were almost too
late the first time. Now, why do you
try to save my life?" ;
Neidermeier lost a large quantity of
blood and was almost pulseless for a
time. The most danger, however, is
that the poisonous phosphorous has
burned him so severely that his life
cannot be saved for its final snuffing
out on the gallows.
Neidermeier got his idea of swallow
ing phosphorus when a prisoner In the
jail committed suicide in that manner
while , Neidermeier was awaiting trial.
For the last two weeks Neidermeier
has been saving the matches he was
able to beg. He gave up smoking to
some extent so he could hoard them.
A letter written by Neidermeier prior
to the attempt at suicide was found
concealed in his cot. In the letter the
writer incidentally expresses repent
ance of his career and regrets leaving
the few who loved him. but chiefly the
letter is a morbid glorification of the
writer's courage and his loyalty to his
kind, in contrast with Niedermeier's
associate, Gustav Marx. The letter
says: /
"There are four reasons why I should
take my own life: First, because of the
public boast that I cannot suicide while
I am so closely guarded. Second, that
I cannot cheat the scaffold. Third,
that they cannot say they executed me
and made me pay for a crime. Fourth,
to have another mystery for the ignor
ant~police to solve."
CHICAGO, April, 18.â Peter Neider
meier, the leader of the car barn
bandits, condemned to die on the gal
lows Friday, made two desperate at
tempts at suicide to-day. His condition
as a result Is so precarious that it is
feared he will not survive. Should he
still be alive next Friday he will be car
ried to the gallows and, executed.
" Neidermeier carefully planned his at
tempted suicide. First' he masticated
and swallowed the heads of 75 or 100
sulphur matches. While the phosphor
ous was burning his stomach he sawed
at the radial astery of his left wrist
with a sharp-pomted lead pencil. Strik
ing a bone in the wrist, he gave, up
trying to sever the artery and turned
his weapon to the large, vein on the
outer side of his left forearm, making
a wound through which the blood
gushed, dyeing his bedclothing and
running down over the cell floor in
pools.
Grades were ordered changed on
Fifth and Sixth avenues, J. and Allen
streets and Leroy place.
The Board, of Works was requested
to compel the Real Estate Development
Company to blast on its property on
Tennessee street, near Eighteenth, at
such times as will cause no danger and
inconvenience to children going to
school and other persons, and also to
cause the removal of debris and boul
ders from the jj sidewalks.
The roadway of Dupont street, from
Montgomery avenue to Vallejo street,
was ordered Improved at a cost of
$10,475. Â£4*tf-
at the end of this' fiscal year.'
The Commissioners ,that are held
responsible under the charter for the
shortage are Marsden Manson, Michael
Casey, and the late George H. Men
dell. As the estate of the last named
has % been finally distributed it is not
thought likely that his pro rata of the
defalcation can be recovered. In the
event that it cannot "the loss wfll fall
on the other two named. It was ascer
tained that it was not through neglect
of Mayor Schmitz that action was not
brought in time against Mendell's es
tate. The papers in the case were only
put in the Mayor's hands two weeks
after further claims against the estate
were barred by the Superior Court/in
the final discharge of the estate. t '
The resolution directing the City At
torney to dismiss' the action of the city
against Victor Albouze et al. for the
condemnation 'of lands proposed to be
purchased for St. Mary's Sauare was
indefinitely postponed on recommenda
tion of the Finance Committee. As
sistant . City Attorney Partridge ex
plained that the dismissal of the suit
would invalidate the city's title to
lands already purchased under con
demnation proceedings because the
lands could only be used for park pur
poses.
Attorney George Shadburne ad
dressed the committee and' urged that
the suits be not dismissed, because le
gal complications of a grave character
would result thereby. <
The petition of Beatrice M. HInkle.
Assistant City Physician, for an allow
ance for transportation and telephone
expenses was denied, as Â¦ the Finance
Committee has decreed that such ex
penses will not be paid unless the
health official interested devotes his
entire time to the city's ' business.
The demands of various State insti
tutions for the maintainence of crim
inal insane were denied, because the
fund is exhausted. J. W. Stetson, at
torney for the institutions, was in
structed to obtain' final judgments for
the amounts. claimed In order. that they
may be paid out of the surplus fund
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
took preliminary steps to collect the
money embezzled by ex-Cashier White
of the Board of Public Works by
adopting: the following resolution: .
Resolved, .That the City Attorney be and he
is ' hereby directed to take all the necessary
legal steps against those persons who consti
tuted the Board of Public Works at the time
of the defalcation of W. H. J. White, former
cashier of sold board, and also against all
other parties - liable, for the recovery of thÂ»
money stolen from the city and county of San

NEW YORK. April 18. â No new Interest
wÂ«i awakened in the Bt^ck market to-day
and there Â«aa the same listless drift of pru.-s
*nd languid operations as for man of the time
last week. The activity of the market is in
a <31mln!khlRK scale from day to day. Such
(light activity as there was to-day was abrupt
ly halted by the announcement from St. Paul
that thÂ«>re would be no derision to-day on
the petition regarding the fanner of dintrlbut
!ng the Northern Securities assetr. This foo
ters the Impression that the market la wait
lu.c on this decision. But the prevailing belief
f in Wall Â»treÂ»t Is against the likelihood of the
I of HiÂ«->n being entertained, while the convic
tion li general that the contest will be pur
rued by other legal Â«ep* on the part of the
t,"nion Paciflc interests. This 4nakes It doubt
ful whether the expected decision at St. Paul
in to release the market from the depression
of It. The repressive influence of the contest
Involved In thie euit is undoubted and the
Ir.flarac* *u Increased by the 7-polnt drop
In Great Northern preferred to-day. Much
discussion Is civen to the continued output
of railroad notes in the money market for
chort veriods and at high Interest rates, not
withstanding the extreme eate of money for

CHICAGO. April 18.â Liberal selling orders
froci the Northwest, where the weather was
reported favorable for spring seeding, caused
wheat to open earler to-day. Trading during
the' earlier part of the session wa* small.' The
only material demand was from sections of
the Southwest, where damage to wheat is re
ported to be increasing daily. July opened
fcigHe to U"6^c lower at 8Â«i^Â®MJHc. In the
absence of support the market declined to 80c.
At this point the Southwestern crop reports
brought lair buying orders. As a result the
market gradually rallied. One of the /features
was the cautious manner in which the room
traders allowed wheat to slip through their
fingers. From 86c July gradually advanced to
sefrc, closing firm at the ton. May sold be
tween 92iic and 92^c, and closed at 02Hc
Trading In the corn pit was light, but the
tone was in the main firm. The opening was.
barely steady, on reports of weather favorable
for farm work. July closed at WKc May
closed at 52c.
Trading in oats was largely by scalpers and
unea?y shorts. The weather was rej>orted as
being more favorable for seeding, but too cold
for promoting growth of what has already been
town. July closed firm at '5794c.
Provisions were slightly eaMer at the start,
owing to the increased receipts and lower hog
prices at the yard*. Later there was a fair
inquiry and the market closed steady Prices
were confined to a range of 10c. the market
leaving off at about Saturday's figures.

In the land fraud case yesterday
Henry P. Dimond succc'dei. . with,
aid from Government counsel, in
inducing Commissioner Heacock to
reverse himwlf and permit the intro
duction of the correspondence that
passed between Dimond and his co ;
defendant and former client. Fred A.
Hyde. Letter after letter was put in
evidence tending to show that when
Dimond became Hyde's attorney he had
no knowledge of Hyde's methods in
acquiring the California and Oregon
school lands afterward transferred to
the Government: that when he found
the Interior Department investigating
these methods he advised his client to
take the only possible means of estab
lishing their legality, and that when
thie advice was rejected he withdrew
from connection with the land specu
lator. 'â¢; ['j U
Thls may or may not clear Dimondâ
"In order to raise this question
squareiy" at ojice," said . Wheeler, "I
now offer the* petition. of -'Hyde .to" the
Secretary . of - the Interior, which was
given to ; Dimond as the n;tsis of his
instructions when "Â¦ he was sent to
Washington'
LAWYER AND 1 CLIENT.
Counsel for the. Government have looked up
the law on the right of Dimond to testify
fully, as to the' relations between himself -and
Hyde cr Demon We find that it absolutely
sustains our contention made last week. There
In 'no*< doubt that Dimond Is -entitled to this
right so far "as the other defendants are con
cerned, the Government having now made out
a" prlma facie can.- of fraud. But we are also
coiivl?Â»ced that these- communications between
Dimond and bis clients are inadmleÂ«lble over
the Government's objection that they are full
of nelf-servinr declarations. Hence we shall
object . to .their, admltslon unless we are per
mitted to .-.\ajmitip them In advance. There
can be no question that under the established
law of thlc country and England an attorney
lia the right- to -protect himself from even
the 'Â«u*r>lc!on of fraud by revealing the com
munication*, of his client. Â¦ -
Having made this little demonstra
tion the attorneys for Dimond and
those for Uncle Sam, who ! had been
fighting bitterly for weeks, spent the
rest of the day In co-opcratlnar to
bring out evidence moetly directed
egainst Hyde. "
After Dimond had repeated in di
vers forms his declaration that when
he was retained to j look after Hyde's
land office business he knew nothing
ofahe. methods by which his client had
obtained his Oregon and / California
school lands, Wheeler asked him to
identify a bundle of letters from John
A. Benson relating to the San Francis
co Mountains reserve, the only mat
ter, as Dimond claims, in which he
acted as Benson's attorney at Wash
ington... J. C. Campbell, Who has
charge of Benson's defense In New
York, was present- and - asked that
these letters be held back until later
In the day to permit him to look over
them. Heney took the opportunity to
argue the important question of priv
ilege between attorney and client. He
eaid in, part: ; .
When court opened yesterday morn
ing Charles S. Wheeler' of Dimond's
counsel made a statement in answer
to newspaper reports that his client
was testifying for the ] Government.
'"There is not a word of truth in it,"
Eaid he, looking mournfully 'serious.
"Mr. Dimond expects the Government
to do its full duty and no understand
ing exists between him or his attor
neys and the Federal representatives."
?"Absolutely none," chorused rHeney
and Pugh. "There is ho 'foundation
whatever for those newspaper re
ports." . . â¢ .
WHKKLEIVS. DENIAL.
The entire day was occupied with the
continuance of Dlmond's direct testi
mony. Among its disclc-sures the name
of Defendant Joost H. Schneider fig
ured prominently. Schneider "was for
merly clerk in Hyde's office, and testi
mony already in identifies him as
Hyde's agent in the alleged frauds in
Oregon school lands. He once made
a partial confession, but this did not
save him frc-m indictment. ' Dimond's
direct testimony will continue to-day,
when his counsel will probably intro
duce his correspondence â¢ with Benson,
as he did with the Hyde letters yes
terday. 'i2f'3 -C:
Uncle Sam is not telling what evidence
he has against the attorneyâ but it is
likely to give Hyde a deal of trouble.
Dimond and Hyde are evidently "out."
While the former protests that he is
not turning State's evidence and has
no understanding with* the attorneys
for the prosecution, the eagerness of
Heney and Pugh to get this correspond
ence In the record indicates that Hyde
and Benson are their real same and
that the Government case will not suf
fer from the admission ->f the letters.
v "What did Hvde tell you about this
order?" the witness was asked, and-he
replied:
He said he was informed the order was
based upon rome statement Joost H.. Schneider
had made to land office representatives. Up
to Â¦ that time I had no suspicion that there
was anything seriously wrong . with Hyde's
selections. He said he did not understand
what Schneider could have, said that would re
sult in such an order, or why Schneider had
caid anything, because he hat treated the
man like a brother. He would send .Walter
K. Slack down to Tucson Â¦ to ' find out what
Schneider had been telling. A -'week later
Hyde told me that all Slack had been able to
learn was that Schneider had Â«ald the -names
of Elizabeth Dimond and Jennie 'Blair in the
Hyde selections were fictitious. Hyde said. he
could produce Elizabeth Dimond. though just
then he did not know where she was. and
â¢ that he had never used the name 'of Jennie
Blair. He wanted me to ' hurry my. proposed
Eastern trip and slop at Tucson to see Schnei
der, as he, wished to know more about what
Schneider had told the- Government.
In 'December, 1902, I started East via Tufc
bon, where I had an interview with . Schneider.
He was .loth to talk, but finally ; admitted
that, he had turned against Hyde ' because of
the latter* Â« 'tad treament" of him. He ad
mitted that when he left Hyde's office he
had received 15000 and that . his . employer had
given s him '$1000. on his marriage, but he be
lieved that he was entitled to more. Schneider
told " me Â¦ he had obtained many bogus titles
for Hyde, and that he himself had - Invented
the names Elizabeth Dimond and Jennie Blair
as well as others he could not recall that were
used in Hj'de's land . transactions. But he. told
me nothing as to his. fraudulent methods of ac
quiring lands, in 'Oregon,., beyond- saying that
he himself put 'the names in the certificates
of ' imrchaae. . Â» Â¦ ,
Schneider seemed so anxious for money arid
so ready to promise to Ktnp his revelations if
Hyde -should pay htm enough that I. believed
what Hyde himself t told me. namely, /that tho
man Â¦ was "a blackmailer. This belief , I , com
municated to Hereford A'. Hazzard, land attor
neys at Tucson.', who were : interested in selec
tions based on EChool lands bought from . Hyde,
but I also told <, them <- that I should not con
tinue as Hyde'e attorney^ unless 1 he should
clear himself.' '?.-*. 'Â¦-,'Â¦.; .
.Then I went East and on arriving at Wash
ington. I found; much excitement there over
the suspension order.". I wrote Hyde eeveral let
ters ou the subject and , have , his : replies.-'.-. 'Â¦'â¢'
> The letters then produced by^ the wit
ness were the revelation of : the. day.
They were admitted over, McEnerney's
objection, the 'Commissioner* ; ruling":
that .they,, were, admissible las to'jDi-,
mond and would '.'not be considered
again'st Hyde. But they putVthe Gov
ernment and the' public in possession
of documentary , information ; not : before
known to exist. GSSSSEaSR
ApMISSIONS TO. DpiOXD.
-The witness asserted that his * first
SCHNEIDER IS BROUGHT IX.
"I am indebted to you for citing that
decision," said Commissioner Heacock,
"and am clad to ad*mit that I was
wrong last week in excluding this cor
respondence. I felt, then that- it was
monstrous that the defendant's mouth
should be closed and gladly learn that
I was in error. The petition will be
admitted."
"We except, to your Honor's ruling,"
said McEnerney.
The petition was then read .by
Wheeler. This was the document pre
sented to Secretary Hitchcock wken, in
May, 1901. he visited San Francisco in
company with President McKinley. It
protested against the order suspending
for investigation all forest lieu selec
tions in which Hyde's school lands
had been offered as bases of the ap
plications. The document set forth in
detail the selections affected by the
department's order. Among its signers
appeared the name of the fictitious
Elizabeth Dimond. This brought' out
the declaration from the witness that
when he went to Washington for. Hyde
in the summer of 1901 he still believed
his client's assertion that Elizabeth
Dimond was an existing person, but
that he later discovered that this was
false. Then he testified lt< was, not un
til the winter of 1902 that he learned
the suspension order had been made
final. . ', 1
the public is paramount and absolves him in
such a case from his duty to his client. Such
is the law laid down by the highest English
court and followed in many American Je
cislons.
COURT COMMISSIONER BEFORE WHOM THE PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF HENRY P. DIMOND AND F. A. HYDE IS I
BEING HELD. AND WHO TESTERDAT ADMITTED IN EVIDENCE LETTERS THAT PASSED BETWEEN THE DE
FENDANTS TENDING TO CLEAU FIRST-NAMED OF CONSPIRACY. Â¦ .1
The officials of the United Railroads
last night refused to discuss the situ
ation, except to state that the company
had not altered its stand, and that
there was no chance of its doing so.
Although the union haa repeatedly declared
that it desires ' to avoid an open rupture in
Its relations with the United Railroads, the
latter has | for eomÂ« time j been engaging men
in .this and other cities under contract to
operate its cars in the event of a strike being
declared by this union.. . In carrying out this
policy the company has taken a step which,
we Â¦ believe, is ' unprecedented and, we respect
fully suggest, merits your disapproval.
,WÂ« refer to the fact. that the United Rail
roads haa an arrangement with Colonel Charles
Austin Coolidge. ' U. . S. A. . (retired), formerly
of the Seventh Infantry, under which this offi
cer of the Government is. recru[tirrg prospective
"strike-breakers'*, among discharged soldiers of
the regular army at. the. Presidio in this city.
' This fact* is well known at the Presidio and
we have thoroughly, satisfied ourselves that we
are not in error. In asserting It to be a fact.
â¢ We do- not believe that such conduct is in
harmony with the principles, that are supposed
to govern the .'actions oft. an = officer of the

this manner directed to the conduct of Colonel
Coolidge in the belief that you will not suffer
it to continue. ' Very respectfully yours.

Dear Sin Division . No. , 205. Amalgamated

The United Railroads of Saa Francisco is a

The relations between . .that corporation and

that the union and the United Railroads Have

MAHON FEARFUL
OF THE FUTURE
President of the Interna
tiqnal Union Says That He
Sees Dark Days Ahead
In the maelstrom of events that have
held the" .United Railroads and the
Carmen's Union, the United States
army has appeared. Officials of the
union assert that; they have discovered
a . plot - whereby / a prominent retired
officer has lent his \ assistance in the
hiring of men . to j the . places of
union men, should a strike occur. In
order to frustrate i this alleged plan,
the . Carmen's j Union has issued an ap
peal to President Roose vein, In which
it asks that Colonel Charles Austin
Coolidge be censured, owing, they claim,
to his having been active in assisting
the United Railroads. ...
A rather gloomy aspect , was placed
on the \ position of, the carmen by the
declaration made "last- evening to a
Call, representative by President Ma
hon of th'j International â¢ Union. Mr.
Mahon s'f.ted the conference 'of
yesterday had had, little effect' on .the
situation I so far as the , carmen ! were
concerned, and that he considered that
the' outlook was '.much .Jess favorable
than it was Saturday.' {Â¦Â¦
"After our conference ' tp.-day," . said
Mr. Mahon, "we ' were Inclined to the
opinion that nothing but some favor
able revelation to the. railroad people
would "bring them to understand .'the
justice of < our claims." 'Â¦â¢,.,,
"Then j you j consider the situation as
foreboding?" was asked.
SITUATION; IS BkACK;
"I look upon;- the situation as. very
black," replied Mr.' Mahon. , "In , fact it
is' much . worse 'than j it was -last Satur
day." While the company has - granted
us a further conference' for Tuesday,
we have little hope of gaining anything
thereby." * â¢
"."Then you think there 'will be a
strike?" was the next question.", \
VAs to that I cannot an
opinion," replied- the national presi
dent. . : ' V .
The conference, which, had been con
tinued from' Saturday, 'began shortly
after 2 : , o'clock, yesterday afternoon;
Representing the -union- side were
President Mahon f -,the International
Union and President \ Cornelius : and
Secretary Bowling . of the ; local organi
zation. For the company President Hoi-'
land, Vice President- Hoi brook 'and Di
rector Tobih, with David .Young, who
appeared In, the -interests of -Brown
Bros.', were in'attendance.
The 'conference* lasted â¢ nearly three
hours,' during which' time Mr. , Mahon
argued* the case . of .the carmen,. 'stating
also that their greatest desire '-. was to
avert any overt action on~ either, side.
Mr. Mahon also.called attention to the
petition sent to' President Roosevelt, In
LAUNDRY GIRLS IN* A MIX-UP.â Berth*
Korhensen and Hilda Danlelson are employed
at the San Francisco Laundry, and yesterday
Hilda secured a warrant for Bertha's arrest
for battery. Hilda allege* that Bertha and
she had some words on Saturday night and
Bertha struck Hilda with a bucket, thereby!
causing a black eye. Â¦
The leading case is the English decision in
Rerina vs. Cox, in which it is clearly | laid
down that where a criminal consults his at
torney before the commission of his crime
the latter.- is not bound by the rule of priv
ilege. Otherwise no attorney would.be sjafe
in listening to a client unless he knew his
whole history.- The rule, the court holds, is
for the protection of the client where he has
confided in his attorney, not where he . has
deceived him, and the opinion adds: â¢ "A com
munication in furtherance of a criminal pur
pose is not within the rule." That is Just
the ciee here. Dimond was deceived by Hyde,
who concealed from him the true nature of
hiF methods in acquiring school land 'â¢bases.'"'
A criminal in consulting his lawyer either
confides In him or deceives him. In the former
case the attorney becomes a conspirator '.and
pcrty to the crime if he does not disclose the
communication;, in the latter case 'he is mil
led. In either case he is clearly absolved from
ths rule where a prlma facie case' is made
out. In other words the attorney's duty to
"We object," McEnerney said, and
then Heney: continued: Â¦ .
At this point court adjourned for the
day. ! During the afternoon Benson's
counsel had put on, the record a formal
objection to the admission of.the?Ben
son-Dimondjcorrespohdence, but doubt
less, according to : the : Commissioner's
ruling on ' the : Hyde letters, . it Vwill be
read In evidence to-day. "
In February, 1903, the witness had re
turned to' San Francisco, 1 he- said, but
obtained so little satisfaction from
Hyde that on April 8 he .wrote Here
ford &, Hazzard a letter from which the
following is extracted:- '
I ' have, for satisfactory reasons, severed all
ccnnectlons , with Mr. Hyde's legal , or any
other business. I feel' that. I am acting. within
the. bounds of personal' obligations, in saying
for -your, information that the plan advised by
Britton ft.Gray and myself is not -being fol
lowed. While a large â¢ number '- of "affidavits
were obtained the particular persons (Elizabeth
Dimond and Jennie ; Blair) were never found,
and . no i attempt"' has\ been made ... to ' find - them.
It Is not now proposed to forward-any of the
affidavits on hand -to.the- various : parties .In
Interest, so that theyJ may .be filed with a
petition for the- elimination from the sua
pension order of the- particular, selection in
each case, but to send them 'In- one : lump ' to
the commissioner in an effort to clear the
skirts of Mr. Hyde. - Â¦ ~
The BUKpension order* will remain until one
of, three things occurs:* Sufficient affirmative
proof, offered to force, or at leant Justify, the
revoking of the order; - proof obtained. by the
special agentnthat frauds were committed,' in
which cape when the mine Is completed -it will
be exploded without warning and tdven to the
puMlc; or that'. the special agents fall In. their
investigations. .' in i which case the order I will
be revoked quietly. .If. the 'facts stated in
your own letters were known. 1 it -must be clear
to you that nothing j we could do would .call
the Government off or . prevent, a , prosecution.
I am- writing only in- your 'Interest,-, but . we
arc facing eober conditions and facts and mutt
fece them. You are sitting' over a'tnlne that
may be set off Â»tÂ»any moment. Â¦; â¢' -. .
. Frankly you were ' making money j too ,f a?t
and got careless, thereby. laying, yourself 1. able
t'> Buch a calamity as has happened, and now
i* is a question of not what j-ou would. like to
do. but what you can do.- The matter -Is past
th<Â» stace of mere cancellation., although that
would follow if, nothings were done by any. of
thrf selectors.- but it'ls, evident' that-all these
people who have paid you thousands ; of. dol
larsfor .their lieu -land, and the 'perfecting: of
their selections are not -' going to : let them gro
without a big fight, and - they : would not , care,
much who was' hurt if- they* saved Jthcmselves.
I am positively informed that- what, the Sec
retary, is after Is not the cancellation "of . the
selections 'only, but proof, sufficient' upon, which
to bane a Federal prosecution on 'the ground
of fraud upon the Government In knowingly
offering a fraudulently obtained and . worthless
title with 'Intent to defraud. The whole thing
has now been taken, out ' of ;the land., office
and is with the Secretary.. *
1 am convinced | that the Bituation here is
so very serious that I have to move with the
greatest caution in order to keep the "nature
Of my investigations to myself. The order of
FUt-pension created a great sensation. All the
attorneys Â¦ before the department ' are excited
about it, all the land office force wrought up
and restless over It and a number of selectors
have inquired what it means.' The commii
siorer declines to dlscuso It at all. The order
in iiuy iiy day becoming generally known. t-
â¢Then came two important' letters
from Dimond, the first written to his
client on January 22, and the second
to Hereford & Hazzard, the Tucson at
torneys^ : To Hyde Dimond had written
from AVashingrton, saying among other
things: . .'
DI.MOXD, WARNS HYDE.
Tell me where the matter Ms now and how
long It will stay there and what the ; next
niovi> will be. Try and find some way out of
it other than ;the one .you susgosted, and by
all means keep. the thing quiet until Commis
sioner Hermann gets out of .office, and keep it
quiet anyhow. â¢ â¢ â¢ r wish , you .would
explain to Mr. Brown the whole.,, basis of
Schneider's statements. Whllp here he was
sometimes 3ent to the notary with deeds where
tbe parties did not appear In person. Â¦ but It
was in cases where the signatures and slgnern
were known to the notary., and while It m../
be irregular, it is very customary to say that
the person appeared. Then, as to his signing
papers, there are always some papers which do
not require original signature, such as notices
for posting.- Â¦-.âÂ¦Â¦'
It is easy for a man in" Washington- to, say.
Prove, to mo' who it was of whom you bought
this l>rop*rty and. what kind of a man ho was.
Ordinarily this would be possible. The title
to c|ty property is held by .people -who are
local -Â¦ residents, but when there is a scramble
for the purchase .of â¢ State lands the movement
is engineered . by â¢ brokers. They do not select
the best, class of. citizens, but they go into the
highways and' byways and the . purchases are
made by those who are here to-day and there
to-morrow. The sales are.- none the less legal,
but it makes them impossible to. trace.- * . "Â¦> *
It is. a 'physical impossibility for. me to
comply with your suggestions. I do not know
the most of . the purchasers < in < California .or

were proclaimed it* was a ecramble between
dozens of different curbstone' real estate dealers
