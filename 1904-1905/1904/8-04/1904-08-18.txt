It is evident that these troops have

NEW YORK, Aug. 17.â Not since the
Letter boom in 1898 has there been wit
nessed; such excitement as. prevailed
on the Produce Exchange to-day. The
wheat pit was in a turmoil and re
sembled the Cotton Exchange - during
January and February, when cotton
prices were soaring.
Wheat, was the chief point of Interest
and corn had a secondary position. The
almost frantic efforts of Chicago trad
ers to obtain . wheat were duplicated
here, and advances, although not so
substantial as in the Western city, were
generally recorded. The mainspring of
activity was fear of frost coming on
top of the extensive damage done the
crop through rust. In Winnipeg a tem
perature of 38 degrees was reported,
and similar low records were reported
throughout the Red River Valley. This
was regarded as indicating a frost,
which would kill and further impair an
already short crop.
'The greatest advance was witnessed
in May option, amounting to 5 cents a
bushel. Wheat for delivers* next May
sold at $1 09% a bushel on Tuesday
night, and to-day it touched $1 14%.
September wheat sold up to $1 12%, and
December wheat to $^13%. The net
gain at the close averaged 4 cents a
bushel.

Captain Matousevitch says the Jap
anese kept at a distance of less than
five miles. The efforts of the Russians
to close with the Japanese and ! sink
some of their vessels by ramming them
or -by gunfire, even at the cost -of
themselves going â¢ to the bottom, were
consequently unsuccessful. The Japan
ese would not permit the Russians to
approach, but the rain of projectiles
never ceased.

frGm Captain Matousevitch, of the
Cesarevitch, now at Tsingchou, show
distinctly that- it was a long range
fight, and that the Russians, sailing in
close formation, were placed at a, great
disadvantage, not only by the super
iority of the Japanese numbers, but
owing to the fact that, after encom
passing Admiral Withoeffs semicircle,
the Japanese were enabled to .pour in

CHICAGO. Aug. 37.â Four persons
were killed, another fatally hurt and
twenty-three slightly injured in a col
lision late this afternoon between an
express train on the Chicago Great
Western Railroad and a train of three
trolley cars bound for the Hawthorne
race track. The dead:
MRR. FRANCES RAUTMAN.
WII.I.IAM IRVING, died in hospital
after amputation of leg.
MRS. JEREMIAH SHUCKROW,
Danville. I1L
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN, about 30
years old.
. FalAJly Injured: Michael Ryan, mo
torman; skull fractured.
The injuries of the others consisted
of cuts, bruises and sprains.
The accident occurred at the crossing
of Forty-eighth avenue and the Chi
cago Great Western tracks. The train
was coming into the city and, accord
ing to some witnesses, was running at
high speed. Others and the train crew
pay that they were not going more
than twenty miles an hour.
The trolley train, which was made
up of a motor car and two trailers, was
in charre of Conductor W. H. Condon
and Motorman Michael Ryan. The car
struck the train just between the en
gine and tender. The motor car was
torn to splinters. The car immediately
behind turned over, was badly wrecked
and was dragged along the track for
300 feet.
Motorman Ryan remained at hfs
post and was fatally hurt. To those
who came to aid him while he lay on
the ground he said:
"The brakes would not work. That
was what* caused it. When I saw that
they -would not work I reversed the
current. Now get aside and be quiet
and I will be all right."
Immediately after saying this Ryan
became unconscious. At the hospital
it was found that his skull was frac
tured and that his death was a ques
tion of a few hours only.
All of the persons killed occupied
seats in the front of the first car. One
woman, yet unidentified at the morgue,
had Just taken a f?eat offered her by
William Tennis. She rolled under the
motor car and was horribly manglea.
Tennis, after giving up his seat, went
to the rear of the car and escaped with
slight injuries.
All of the members of the Chicago
Great Western train crew and the con
ductor of the trolley cars were placed
under arrest, pending an investigation.
NEW YORK, Aug. 17.â Ths most
sensational incident In the great build
ing trades lockout and strike, which
have thrown nearly 25,000 workmen
into idleness, came to-day when Philip
Weinseimer, president and organizer of
the Building Trades Alliance, was ar
rested on a charge of extortion. When
the labor leader was arraigned he was
confronted by George J. Essigr, a
plumber, who charged that on Decem
ber 3 last he paid Weinseimer $1000 so
that work could be resumed upon an
apartment house on Riverside Drive.
Weinseimer's counsel appeared to be
anxious to have the examination go 'an
at once, but, upon motion of District
Attorney Jerome, It was put over until
to-morrow, bail being fixed at $1500 and
given.
In an affidavit Essig says that in De
cember last he had the contract for
the plumbing In the Chatsworth build
ing; that Weinseimer called a strike
and two days later said that for $2700
he would put the plumbers back at
work. â¢ *
Essig said he could not- pay the sum
in full and agreed to pay $1000 imme
diately and give notes for the balance.
He had taken up all the notes but one,
which was due to-day, and. on the ad
vice of the District Attorney he took
marked bills to pay the remainder.
When Weinseimer was arrested Essig
had just signaled to the detectives that
the labor leader had the maÂ»-jed bills
in his possession. The detecwes' did
not find the money on the prisoner,
however.
As the examination began District
Attorney Jerome, somewhat excited,
pushed to the front and peremptorily
called Robert P. Bell, one of the law
yers, to the witness stand. Bell had
started to leave the courtroom.
District Attorney Jerome asked If he
had received any money from any per
son in the courtroom. Bell replied that
he had received one one-dollar bill. The
District Attorney wanted to know if he
had seen any other money pass in the
courtroom and the lawyer said that he
had not. He said he was willing to
show all the bills he had. but the other
lawyers objected to this.
"I am asking these questions." said
Jerome, "because of occurrences In this
courtroom. I am Informed by a lawyer
in good standing at the New York bar
that bills were passed by this defend
ant to this witness."
The witness denied that he had re
ceived any money from Weinseimer.
.WORCESTER. Mass.. Aug. 17. â Sen
ator George Frisbie Hoar lies dying in
the house in Oak avenue, in this city,
which he has made his home for nearly
fifty years. He may linger for several
days, but his physicians agree that the
inevitable end is very near. His fam
ily physician and Dr. Folsom of Boston
in consultation this afternoon,
ut were unable to find any ground for
nope of his recovery.
Senator Koar is dying of general
iveakness consequent upon his long ill
ness. His hearts action is impaired.
his kidneys have almost ceased to per
form the!r functions, his lung^ 4W fill
ins up, yet his brain is clear. He is
perfectly conscious of his condition and
ci.^cusses it freeiy with his son, Dis
frict Attorney Rockwood Hoar, who is
constantly at his bedside. Miss Mary,
Hoar, the Senator's only daughter, is
also with him. as are his eon's wife
and her two children. His personal
Senate messenger, Edward Doherty, is
within call at all times.
. Senator Hoar some time ago ex
prfss*<i the hope that when his end
came its approach should not be ac
companied by an impairment of mind
or severe pain. Both wishes are grati
fied. He talked and joked with his
physician to-day and made playful re
marks to hi? little grandchildren when
they came in on their daily visit. AH
his earthly matters are arranged and
h*> contemplates th*Â» end with perfect
serenity.
The Senator's illness dates back to an
attack of lumbago in Washington last
spring, which kept him from his place
in the Senate. When he came home he
â¢"emed to have nearly recovered, but
was not Ftronff. and hfs physicians
earnestly cautioned him to take a com
plete rest. and. above all things, not to
attempt any public speaking. He dis
regarded the injunction when, late in
May. he delivered a forty-minute ad
dress in the open air at the bicenten
nial celebration of the town of Sutton.

"These prices," said Taylor, "went
into effect this morning. Thev cannot
be considered as a cut In the prices of
the pooling agreement, as there was
no such agreement regarding thl3 com
pany's products. I can't say anything
as to the purpose of the cut. The
United States Steel Corporation would
be the one to make a statement on
this subject. We simply get our in
structions and give out prices."
Dispatches from Pittsburg. however,
announced that the cut extended from
$5 to $12 a ton. As the normal annual
output of wire products of the United
States Steel Corporation is about 1,000,
000 tons, it was estimated that the gross
Income of subsidiary companies manu
facturing such products will thereby
be cut down from 53,000,000 to $12,000,
000 a year.
. While rails and billet* were not af
fected by to-day's cut, it was realized
that a great price war i3 imminent,
and this in spite of the fact that the
heads of the big iron and steel com
panies in this city and Pittsburg would
not admit that they had reduced the
prices of structural steel. An open
market was predicted in all the princi
pal steel products excepting rails.
According to T. H. Tavror. assistant
general sales agent of the company, the
reductions amounted to $4 a ton on
wire nails. $7 a ton on barbed wire and
$5 a ton on fence wire.

The St. Louis Exposition.
Dire predictions were made by our poli
tical opponents of what would happen at the
Bt. Loulg convention, but they misjudged the
temper of the party and the people. While
there had been differences In preceding cam
paigns, yet at St. Louis they were all har
monized and a common ground was found
upon which all could stand and do battle for
Democratic principles. A platform was adopt
ed by a unanimous vote, embracing the issues
of the day and presenting to the people a
declaration of principles which. In the lan
guage of the times, la sane, safe and sound.
With a candidate whose personality appeals
to the good sense and nound judgment of the
American people, a platform whose principles
are for the greatest good to the greatest num
ber and a reunited Â¦ party, earnest for the
restoration of good and economical government,
we should succeed and the principles of Demo
cracy again triumph.
I beg my countrymen, as they value their
liberty, to guard with the sacred right of
local self-government and to watch with a
Jealous eye the tendency of the times to cen
tralize power In the hands of the few.
Mr. Chairman, it is an added pleasure to
receive this notification at your hands. You
have been conservative and courageous as
leader of our party in the House of Repre
sentatives, a position which few have filled
with the signal' ability that you have dis
played. It will be my pleasure and duty, at
a time not far hence, to accept more formally
In writing the, nomination which you have
tendered In such graceful and complimentary
terms and to give my views upon some of
the Important questions now commanding the
attention of the country.
I congratulate your committee and the con
stituency it represents In the selection by the
delegates to the national convention of the
nominee for the Presidency. He Is a man
of courage, yet prudent; of high Ideals, yet
without pretense; of the most wholesome re
spect for the constitution and the majesty
of the laws under It and a sacred regard for
their limitations; of the keenest sense of Jus
tice, which would rebel against compounding
a wrong to an individual or to a nation;
positive In conviction, yet of few words; strong
In mental and moral attributes and yet withal
modest, possessed of a sturdy constitution and
magnificent manhood, and yet temperate In
his actions and dignified In his demeanor.
It Is not the orator or man of letters, but
the man of reserve force, of sound Judgment,
of conservative methed and steadiness of pur
pose whom the people have called to the of
fice of the Presidency. Notably In the con
tests between Jefferson- and Burr, Jackson and
Cl^y. I-lncoln and Douglas, Grant and Grecley,
Cleveland and Blaine.

The Republicans ! now claim great con
sistency In their attitude upon the currency
question and the President In his recent speech
of acceptance said that they know what they
mean when they, speak of a stable currency,
"the same thing from year to year," and yet
tn the platform of their party in 18S4, 188S
and 1892 they favored the; double standard of
value. In the platform of 1SS8 they said,
"The Republican party Is In favor of the
use of both gold and silver as money and
condemns the policy of the Democratic ad
ministration In Its efforts to demonetize sil
ver."
The receipts of the Government for the
year ending June 30, 1002, the first fiscal year
of the present administration, showed a sur
plus over expenditures of $01,000,000, but for
the fiscal year ending June 30. 1004, Instead
of a surplus there was a deficit of Â§41,000.000.
From July I, 1904, to August 10, or
for about a month and a third of the
present flÂ»cal >;ear, the expenditures of the
Government have exceeded the, receipts by $21.
715,000. There could b* no' stronger evidence
of the extravagance Into which the Republican
party has fallen and no mnre potent argument
in behalf of a change to the party whose
tenets havÂ«s always embraced prudence and
economy In administering the T*K>ple'B affairs.
Our Republican frtends are prone to refer
to the great commercial growth of the coun
try under their rulÂ», and yet the census reports
show that from 1850 to 1860, under Democratic
rule and the Walker tariff, the percentage of
Increase was greater In population, wealth and
manufactures and railroad mileage, the factors
which affect most largely the prosperity of the
country, than in any decade since.
The cost of government has largely In
creased'under Republican rule. The expendi
tures per capita for the last years respectively
of the administrations given, taken from the
reports of the Secretary of the Treasury, were
as follows:
DEFICIT IX THE TREASURY.
My experience as a wage earner and my as.
aociation with labor have alike taught me
the value of Democratic principles, for In
them the humblest has the strongest security
fcr Individual right and the highest stim
ulus to that independence of spirit and lova
of self-help which produce the finest private
characters and form the base of the best pos
sible government.
For years I worked In the ranks as a wage
earner and I know what It Is to earn my liv
ing by the sweat of my brow. I have always
believed, and my convictions come from the
hard school of experience, that, measured by
the character of work he does and the cost of
living, a man is entitled to full compensation
for hia servicea.
and those that are open are being operated
with reduced forces on short hours. Then
wai.es were hlxh, labor was scarce and there
Â«m work for all. Now work is scarce, many
wage earners unemployed and wages reduced.
The apprehension which now prevails In busi
ness circles and the present unsatisfactory
Industrial conditions of the country seem to
demand a political change.
In the language of our platform, "the rights
of labor are certainly no less vested, no less
Bacre<t and no legs Inalienable than the rights
of capital." The time is opportune to em
phasize the truth of this utterance. The most
pacred right of property U .the riffht to possess
and own one's self and ths labor of one's
own hands, capital Itself being: but stored up
labor.
Checks of every bank In the city,
about fifty altogether, were utilized by
Sweiger and he was not particular as
to the name he signed to a checH..
The sums he received on the checks
run from $6 50 to $50. His appear
ance is prepossessing and he dres3e3
well. He would represent himself
sometimes as a physician, at other
times as a druggist, a lawyer or a car
penter, just as the fancy struck him.
Several charges of forgery will be
placed against him.
So many complaints were received
by the police from saloon-keepers that
orders were given by Chief Wittman
to locate the forger at all hazards.
Dfctectives Fitzgerald and Graham In
the Mission district have been partic
ularly active in searching for the
criminal and on Tuesday evening- they
traced him to 5 Lapidge street, where
he was living as George McLean, a
carpenter by trade. To keep up the
Illusion he had purchased a kit of car
penters' tools.
Fitzgerald and Graham, accom
prnied by Policemen T. Furman ajid
D. Russell, -went to 5 Lapidge street
that .night, but Sweiger saw them
Ci-ming and made his escape by
climbing out of a window in the rear.
They continued their search for him
and landed him in an empty house at
Twentieth and Guerrero streets about
2 o'clock yesterday morning. He wa3
quickly handcuffed and taken to the
City Prison, where he was locked up
in "the tanks." x
The police have in custody an ex
convict who has been for months pass
ing fictitious checks on saloon-keepers
throughout the city, principally in the
Mission. His real name is supposed
to be George B. Sweiger. but he haÂ»
served a three years' term in Folsom
penitentiary on a charge of forgery
committed in Sacramento under the
name of E. G. Steiger. He also served
a term of eighteen months in the
House of Correction for passing: a fic
titious check. He has numerous other
aliases, including George Breen,
George McLean, H. Halloway and C.
H. Wilson.
The refreshments offered will be the
Georgia cracker, which is the cele

"Georgia's Toast to Her HostâCali

Tfce excursions and side trips ar-
Taiiged for the visiting Knights Tem-
= p!ar and their friends who will attend
the conclave will probably be among
the chief attractions for visitors. They
v, ill have a rare opportunity to see San
Francisco vicinity and the sights and
â¢wonders of California in all their splen
dor. George AV. Lippman. chairman of
thÂ°e excursion committee, has succeeded
3n perfecting special arrangements for
the visitors during conclave week. On
*vÂ»>dncscday, September 7, and Thurs
day, September 8, there will be free
excursions on the bay of San Fran
c-isco axid all points of Interest. Two
Â«>f rhe best and most commodious boats
iiave been engaged for these excur
sions, and each will make two trips
â¢qach day. An orchestra will be on
each boat, and light refreshments will
>e served. These excursions will be for
vrsiting Sir Knights and their families
<on!y. Ail the railroads will soil excur-
Fi^n tickets at low rates to points
throughout the State.
J':a:.6 for arranging trips to nearby
points of interest were again discussed
und all agreed that a suitable commit
tee should be appointed to meet the
visitors and see that they be given all
â¢ nteessary information and that excur
sions be arraneed.
The following committee on informa
â¢ lion ahd points c-f Interest Â¦ was ap

We know that the reason why labor was
more highly paid, even in colonial times, In
America, than the same labor for the same
work as paid In Great Britain, must have been
the existence of some sort of "protective"
legislation, keeping out of America the pauper
labor and the products of the pauper labor,
of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. It
Is true that we have not thus far found the
law upon the statute books, and we are told by
Ignorant historians that- there was no such
legislation, but whether that sort of legis
lation has been yet found or not, it must
have existed, because superior wages and the
prosperity of the worklngman must be had,
and can only bÂ« had by force of a policy
of legislative protectionism. The Ion statute
will bÂ« found after awhile â never fear, sir â
because the theory cannot be sustained In
any other way, and ihe theory, as our Re
publican friends tell uÂ«. is "our fixed national
policy," hence to doubt it would be dis
loyalty.
A wise man entertains a sovereign con
temi* for a great many sorts of errors, but
the poverelgnlet of ; all should be visited on
the designing Idiot who says that the price
of labor depends upon the ajnount of ' w-ork
to be done in a country and the number of
men' capable and desirous of 4Bolng It â In a
word, on demand for or suppl- of labor.
That particular sort of peculiarly Inspired
idiot attempts to explain that the high waxes
which were paid in California and all the new
States for those employed on farm. In store,
mine ni* forest. In comparison with the wages
paid In older States, which were without free
lands and with comparative abundance of
laborers, la to be accounted for by the com
parative scarcity of worklngmra and the com
rarative abundance of new work In the new
fetates.
STATUTE IS MISSING.
What we ought to have fought for during
colonial da>-3 was a high protective tariff to
keep British products out of the American
market and another high protective tariff to
keep American products out of the British
market; thus enriching both Britain and
America. Then, after we had accomplished
our independence, and each State had become
a separate sovereignty, South Carolina ought
to have protected herself against "Pennsyl
vania and New England. Pennsylvania ought
to have seen to it that a line of custom
houses prevented the invasion of her sacred
soil by the products of the Jerseyman, the
Marylander and the Delawarean. We ought
to have encouraged Interstate trade by stop
ping It es much as possible, thus pursuing in
that regard the enlightened policy which pre
vails in retard to our International trade.
How in the world It has happened (though
I confess it <5id happen) that during colonial
times, where there were no custom-houses be
tween the several colonies and when all the
products of Great Britain had free access to
our markets, our laborers yet worked at
wages very much higher than those whlrh
then prevailed in Great Britain, I cannot un
derstand. How it has happened, since we be
came a Federal nation, the comparatively
pauper negro labor of Central Mississippi has
not been able to run the high-priced white
lahor of Central New York out of the farm
ing business, I also cannot understand.
Nor can I understand how It Is that wages
In California ehould have been for years two
or three times what they werÂ« In Maryland,
although the products of the comparatively
pauper labor of Maryland had free access to
California, and although that comparatively
pauper labor Itself was secured by the con
stitution Itself In the privilege of migration
to and sojourn In California.
Stranger yet, the pauper labor of all Eu
rope was dally flocking both to Maryland and
California, I again do not understand â I
doubt even If Uncle Joe Cannon himself can
fully understand â these foolish facts.
The next great histories! blunder. In fpite
of which, strange to ray. we have, as I
cannot too often repeat, prospered right along
in every *t*P of our history, with now and
then a temporary drop back, was the im
molation by our ancestors of the nation's in
dustrialism upon the altar of free trade within
the. common domain, notwithstanding already
existing State lines furnished convenient place,
opportunity and temptation to establish cus
tom-houses, those potent encourageis of com
merce.
You. sir. you who have a Republican son-in
law, and therefore, possees culture by affinity at
least, will hardly believe that our ancestors
were stupid tnough to fight asairist the prin
ciple which we so frankly recognize in the
Philippines, viz., that it is perfectly right,
self-evidently proper, fcr a flas to cover and
cir.blemize two entirely differ* nt sorts of gov

other fcr ethers "in the colonies" â absolutely
discretionary in its character and avowedly
limiting industrial development there by tht:
necessities of commercial exploitation for the
benefit of the "home" merchant and the
"home" manufacturer.
The riFXt grÂ»>at blunder of our early hls
tcry consisted in their taking up arms against
Kins George and hU forces, when the latter
were actuated, as they themselves confessed,
only by tbÂ» kindest designs of "benevolently

our opportunities. < >

The first of these consisted In discrimina
tions against the red man â the image of God
in cherryâ on account of his race and color
and previous condition. *>ur ancestors said
it was on account of the Inherent or inherited
race traits, und^ncies and supj>osed incapaci
ties of v.-hirh h!Â» color was but the outward
sign. Be that claim pretense or sinoerity, we
found, to our astonishment, that "the door
or opportunity and hope" in the way
of office holding and voting had been
closed to Lo ti.e poor Indian. He was not in
vited in by thÂ» Selectmen in Connecticut nor
by the electors of the self-governing towna
In Massachusetts to help govern our ancestors
and the country which thfy had committed
to their charge, nor did our ancestors promise
to assimilate him.
As soon as 1 learned that I was, by reso
lution of th-: convention, to be the mouth
pit-ce of the committee for the performance
of this j>lt-a.Â«a.!.t task I began to look about
ir.e in order to see how the duty had been

performances of a similar character in the

speech, a historical essay is altogether the
proper thing, absolutely necessary for the
emergency. We shall therefore entitle our
notification address: "A brief historical dlsqui

Williams pleased his hearers im
mensely. The Mississippian laid down
to Davis ironically rules of conduct to
govern his official career, each rule
based on some characteristic of the
opposition. He said in part:

Davis was escorted to the flag-draped
platform at 1:30 o'clock by Represen

address. Williams occupied an hour
in speaking. It took Davis ten min

Remember above all things that our chlaf

modestly venerate* greatness In others, who
actually prefers "piping times of peace" to
the "pomp and circumstance of glorious war."

RESPONSE OF THE NOMINEE.
The response of Davis was aa fol
lows:
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the com
mittee: The official notification which you
bring of my nomination for the Vic*. Presi
dency of the United States by the national De
mocracy elves mÂ« a feeling of slnoerest grati
tude to my party for the honor conferred.
At the game time It brings to me a deep
Â¦enso of my recponslblllty to my party as a
candidate and to my country. In caa* of my
election.
A -spirit of determination to succeed In the
campaign before us appears to pervade the
rank and file of our party in all sections of
the country- Of that rank and fll* I have
for many years been a. member and have .at
all times devoted my humble powers to party
success, believing that success to be for the
country'" good. Unexpectedly called as I am
nov7 to the forefront, I am Impelled to an
acceptance of the obligation by a sense of
gratitude to my fellow workers and the hope
that I may be able the better to assist in re
storing to power that party whose principles
and past history guarantee a safe, wise, ecnom-
Ical and constitutional administration of the
Government.
I find It. therefore, a rreat pleasure, stand
ing here upon the borderland of the two Vir
ginian, to receive and accept the commission
you bear and to send greetings through you
to the Democracy of the entire country. Is
It not significant of a closer and truer broth
erhood among us that for the first time since
the civil war a nominee on the national ticket
has be<n taken from tbat section of our coun
try that lies south of Mason and Dixon's
line, a happy % recognition of the obliteration
of all sectional differences which led to and
Â¦ followed that unhappy struggle?
FOR THE GOLD STANDARD.
As an Introductory to thÂ« few remarks I
shall make, I desire to say that I heartily
Indorse the platform upon which I have been
nominated, and. with the convention and IU
nominee for President, regard the present mon
etary standard of value aa irrevocably es
tablished.
In the campaign preceding the last elec
tion much stress was laid by the Republican
speakers upon the prosperous condition of the
country and forebodings were heard of the
111 results, especially to the laboring man.
which would follow any change in the po
litical comDlexion of the Government It U
true that the times then were good, but it
Is no less a fact that while there has been
no chang* In the party In' power many of the
evils prophesied have come under Republican
rule. â¢ Â¦
As to the common herd who sÂ«nd these
"cattle" to Washington, all you need with
them is to talk platitudes about "civic rlght
eoufneps" and the "Ftrenucusness of life."
What they want to do is to sit In th* galleries
and witness the play. Make yourself the star
performer, according to your opportunities.
In conclusion, sir, pray for war. Nobody
can tell what great things war will end in
when once begun. It might result in making
your thief the first "Emperor and Lord Pro
tector of the Western Hemisphere.". You
would, of course, in that event, as heir ap
parent, share his glory. Your legal title might
become "Prince d'Outre Mer." I know you
would run t-ome little risk of having him des
ignate his Secretary of War aa his successor,
but I believe I would chance it. Besides,
peace Is a tamo and unstrenuous thing and
"Ffnothers nut some of the finest instincts
cf manhood."
It will be your duty as. a part of the exec
utive branch of the Government to look di>wn
with contempt upon the legislative branch.
You will Â«oon learn that "the cattle" who
inhabit the Senate chamher and the other
wing of the Capitol, the lower House (which
has, been getting constantly lower and lower
every day for many years), are but little. If
any, hotter than the other cattle who fent
thorn thÂ«>re. tho farmers and mechanics and
dor-tor? and preachers "and merchants of the
United States.
Men. sir, are not responsible for the elze
of their opportunities. They are responsible
fnr taking advantage of them â sometimes for
riot making them, as in re Panama republic,
for Instance.
Your opportunity will not be as great as
that of the President himself, but as presi
dent of the Penate you may have some oppor
tunity, the opportunity of changing the Sen
ate rul<Â»s on your own motion, or doing some
ether revolutionnry thing which, as a play to
the galleries, will. make your good old Welsh
name famous as that of one of the most
spectacular and strenuous of m#nvj
What a queer, old-time, childish idea was
that of our ancestors that the President of the
United Slates Is simply a chief executive, and
that his duty consists in executing the laws
as they were written. I need not tell you,
sir. that If you should be elected Vice Presi
dent it would be one of your duties as sort
of heir apparent to th<Â» crown to train your
pelf and Influence your chief. Judge Parker,
in the way of usurping the other department*
of ihe Government.
DITTIES OF VICE PRESIDENT.
That reminds me of another blunder of our
ancestors, both under the common law In
Great Britain and in the United States. They
seem to have entertained a notion that com
binations In restraint of trade, eeeklng mo
nopoly and throttling competition, are in some
way adverse to the development of Individual
ity, and somehow poison the life of trade.
They went po far as to contend that the high
est object of man's existence is not to be
well managed, even at a living money profit
to himself, but that it Is to learn to manage
himself well.
We know now that combinations of corpora
tions seeking with the power of monopoly the
resultant power of robbing consumers by rais
ing prices to an extortionate figurfc, under the
shelter of tariff law;?, shutting out foreign com
petitors, and seeking the further resultant
power to bear down the price to be paid to
the farmer raising the raw material, and seek
ing the yet further resultant power to regulate
wages by reason of the fact that the. work
ingrnan has nowhere else to go to get work
except to the concerns In the combinations,
are, on the whole, beneficial institutions in a
free republic of self-governing men.
Another error of our grandfathers in con
nection with our foreign affairs has come over
mo lately with weighing-down emphasis.
George Washington â who, however, was noth
ing but a plain Virginia planter, a sort oÂ£
hlgh-claea farmer, and, therefore, one of. the
"basis set," not to'be thought of in the same
breath with such platform-makers as the Sen
ator from Massachusetts, or such virile his
tory makers as our fellow-citizen in the White
}lou.Â«c â thought (and possibly hla Secretary of
State, Thomas Jefferson, had a great deal to
do with inspiring him to think) that our
wisest and best and most patriotic foreign pol
icy consisted in amicable relations with all
the other nations of the world, and entangling
alliances with none of them â in other words,
that our chief duty was to keep our own
house In order with the notion in our stupid
minds that the sum total of the rightful pur
pose of all Just government is the freedom and
hardiness of man.
How wonderful it is that we" prospered with
that sort of a foreign policy and maintained,
withal, the respect and good will of the world â
wonderful. Indeed, when we consider what we
now know to be accepted, sound axioms of in
ternational policy. We know now, from our
fellow-cltiien in the White House, that thÂ«s
peoples who may expect our tolerance and
friendship are "theso who maintain order and
prosperity," those who "govern themselves
well." those who "pay their financial obli
gations." and that it may become "a duty
which we cannot ignore, certainly in the west
ern hemisphere." to "Intervene" in some way
more or less indefinite in the domestic affairs
of '"thoee who do not do all these things."
nor "behave with decency in political and in
dustrial matters." whatever in the world that
may mean:- but who, by the omission of the
doing of all theye things do "loosen the tiea
which bind together civilized society." uhlch
ties, of course, God has appointed us his mun
dane vice-regent-mechanlcs to tighten up
again.

WILL HARNESS

To-morrow another big battle exer
cise will begin at 7 o'clock. Count de
Montague ; of the . Culraslers of the
French army followed ' the umpires
throughout the maneuvers to-day. He
Colonel Pitcher, with his provisional
Infantry of the blues, made a dashing
deployment and at a critical stage of
the game he caught two battalions of
the browns In the left flank, but his
support did not come in time to follow
up the -advantage, so he lost them.*
In the meantime Colonel Markley was
Blowly advancing with the train." He
came too slowly,, in fact, for at v thls
juncture the umpires sounded the re
call, which left the position of affairs
in status quo so far as the casual ob
server was able to note. The battle will
be fought out and decided by the um
pires in the assembly tent to-night.
During the maneuvers to-day prom
inent ranchers in the vicinity sent for
the use of the troops a four-horse load
of watermelons and substantial refresh
ments for the officers.
The train, with its blue convoy of
cavalry, artillery and infantry under
command of Colonel A. C Markley,
began its march early. When it got
under way it was fujly a mile long.
It slowly worked its way up through
wild mountain passes and quiet defiles
until it came near the enemy's coun
try. Here the train was left in a se
questered spot, drawn close together
and entirely surrounded by its convoy
of infantry" From this point the field
artillery, in command of Captain Ira
Haines, made a brilliant dash forward
to gain a commanding point near
Shale Rock, which high position of
vantage he succeeded in gaining.
The mountain side was steep, but
the battery 'gained 'the top'and swung
their heavy guns about on a stfeep
ridge, where they could command tÂ£e
country for miles around. This was
generally considered to be the feature
of the exercises. It was executed with
great dash and vim. While all this
wag going on Colonel Ward, In com
mand of the browns, was preparing
to attack the blues. He exposed his
troops to the enemy and brought out
the first fire.
The problem of to-day was the at
tack and defense of a convoy. The
supposition was that a train consist
ing of about 100 wagons, which. had
been loaded at Asuncion station with
supplies for a rnain> body operating
upon the coos', north of Port Harford,
is moving to the coast via Eagle
ranch gate, escorted by a Blue force
composed of the three arms. In or
der to reach its destination the train
is compelled to pass through a raid
ing brown force, which is to make an
attempt to cut off, capture or destroy
the train. All this took place over a
rough, mountainous, country, inter
spersed .with broad valleys and deep
ravines.
ATASCADERO, Aug. 17. â The bat
tle exercises "that took place to-day
Mere by far the most interesting and
the most spectacular of any of the
evolutions that have yet taken place
Id the camp. In these maneuvers more
thstn 4000 officers, enlisted men and
umpires took part, and in addition
there were about 1200 horses and
mules employed. A territory about
ten miles in length and five miles in
width was covered during the exer
cises. The heavily wooded hills re
sounded with echoes of thousands of
shots from the infantry, intermingled
with lively cannonading from the field
artillery.
Again the militiamen showed that
they were made of good stuff. From
7 o'clock until 2 p. m. they were prac
tically upon the march. The heat of
the day caused several to drop from
the ranks and wait for the ambulance
to come along and give them a lift.
In each instance where a man was
overcome his canteen was found to be
empty, whereas those who remained
in lino came home with partially filled
canteens. Some of the umpires seemed
to think this would indicate that the
excessive drinking of water when
marching had much to do with the
men falling out.
After reading the letter Sass ran to
th<= Mulberry-street station and told
the police.

BAKERSFIELD, Aug. 17.âBegin
ning next Monday, the Standard Oil
Company will refuse to accept a single
drop of Kern Kiver oil, not already
contracted for, at any price. Follow
ing on the announcement of the sen
sational cut of more than 20 per cent
in prict, announced last Monday, the
news has created a sensation on all
sides. The order was received by Su
perintendent Page to-night, and was
by him announced to the operators,
without explanation.
Following the cut in price Saturday
the Associated sent word to all oper
ators that it would take all oil offered
at the old price of lo cents, the..Stan
dard's new price beinR 11 2-3 cents.
Hitherto the Associated has paid the
same price aa the Standard, never
varying from it, and there is much
speculation as to the meaning of the
action now taken. That the combine
has any intention of bucking Rockefel
ler is not believed, and it is thought
that there must be an understanding
of some kind.
At Coalinga the Standard, some
months ago, withdrew from the mar
ket, so far as the heavy fuel oil wa-3
concerned, and the Associated has
since handled all oil beiow 21 gravity,
leaving the higher grade illuminating
oils to .the btandard.
The Standard has at present four
teen reservoirs completed at Kern
Kiver, v.ith a capacity of over ten mil
lion ban els, and all are filled to the
limit, with oil contracted for to fill all
that can be built for months, while the
great nine line is not pumping south of
Coalinga. The Associated, on the
other hand, has storage for over a mil
lion and a half barrels, with only about
one-third tilled, and contracts with the
railroads that will afford a market for
all that it can produce or purchase.
It is also learned that the Standard
has cut the price of oil at Santa Maria
from 75 to 40 cents.

Max Gutter was arrested yesterday
by Detectives Bunner and Freel on
Montgomery street on a warrant is
sued in May last on complaint of El
kan Conn of the Crossley building,
charging him with obtaining money
by false pretenses. It was alleged that
GQtter had passed a "gold brick" on
Cohn, for which he received $1700.
Cohn and his brother Morris carried
the brick to the Mint, where they
.were speedily undeceived. Cohn at
the time asserted that he had been
swindled out of $30,000 by Gutter In
mining deals and the "gold brick" was
to recompense him.
Gutter says he left here In May for
Nome, where he has some mining
claims. Cohn was with him when he
bought his ticket and they were to
gether nearly up to the time the train
started. His attorney wrote him that
Cohn had sworn to the warrant and
he came here to clear himself.
"I know nothing whatever about
the gold brick," -said Gutter. "Cohn
and I have been interested for some
years In mining claims and still are.
I believe Cohn was instigated to
ewear to the warrant by Mocris. his
brother, who is my bitter enemy. Cohn
breakfasted with me at my home yes
terday morning and this morning and
declared that he did not want me ar
rested."
After being booked Gutter was re
leased on $1000 bonds accepted by Judge

City Auditor A. H. Breed to-day de
cided, under protest, to audit the bills
of the Contra Costa Water Company
for July. This action is taken upon the
advice of Citv Attorney McElroy and
Mayor Olney. The point was whether
the injunction of the United States
Circuit Court piohibitlnjr the enforce
ment of the rew water rates would
be effective as against the Auditor.
Touching that phase of the situation
City Attorney McElroy,* in a written
cpinion, said:
The rates fixed by the resolution of the City
Council, adopted May 31, 1004, cannot be en
forced at present, owing to the temporary in
junction issued by the Circuit Court of the
United States in action entitled Contra Costa
Water Company vs. City of Oakland et al.,
consequently your action in above' motion
cannot be governed by said named resolution.
Further City Attorney McElroy said:
The bills that have been approved by the
Board of Public Works and the Board of Po
lice and Fire Commissioners were for water
furnished during the month of July. 1004, to
the city of Oakland, and the Contra Costa
Water Company Is entitled to the reasonable
value thereof, and as the rates: attempted to
be established by resolution of the City Coun
cil, adopted May 31, 1904, cannot rule your
action in the matter of approval or rejection
of said bills. In your capacity as Auditor, It
Is your duty to determine what Is the reason
able value of the water so furnished.
The question of reasonable .rates Is now
before the courts and in the absence of a
decision from a court of final resort I would
advise, considering the great difficulties in
cident to this matter and under all the cir
cumstances, that the above bills be audited.
I would advise, however, that you audit said
bills paid under protest.
City Auditor Breed said:
In view of this opinion. In which Mayor
Olney concurs, I can see no other course to
follow than to audit the claims and to draw
the warrants. I have therefore decided to
take that, action.

' Edward E. â¢ Thornton, superintend

that his wife would go away wlth'out

ferry for the transportation of freight. If thiÂ»
boat would carry paswngeni Jt wouhi furnish
an Increased service, but thU would require
the operation of street cars to the foot of
Broadway in order that passengers might be
conveyed to different part* of the city. This
would increase the expenses of the Oakland
Transit Consolidated, and. In their Judgment,
the revenue would not justify the expense.
We. therefore, report the matter bark to the

replied that to run an hourly service,
the first boat to start at 5:20 a. m. on

secretary to Secretary of Commerce
Victor H. Metcalf during that official's
terms In the House of Representatives.
Frederick M. Campbell, former State
Superintendent of Public Instruction
and one of the pioneer school teachers
of California, was stricken with paraly
sis this afternoon at his residence, 1262
Webster street. As Campbell had only
recently recovered from a severe para
lytic shock the attack to-day caused
grave alarm over his condition.
Dr. J. L. Mayon, the family physi
cian, was called to the Campbell resi
dence and attended the patient. The
doctor pronounced the stroke a light
one. He expressed the hope that a re
currence of the shocks would be
checked. Late to-night Campbell was
resting easily. The closest attention is
being given his case.
Less than a month ago the engage
ment of Campbell and Mrs. H. M. L.
Walker, formerly of Honolulu, was an
nounced. The wedding was set for a
day not fixed in November. Mrs. Walk
er became acquainted with her pros
pective husband through meeting Miss

In anticipation of the reopening of the
fall term at the University of Califor
nia there has been a large influx of
prospective freshmen to Berkeley the
last few days. Indications point* to an
increase in the number of the fresliman
class over last year, and possibly there
will be more than 700 members of the
first class. The highest number of stu
dents was reached in 1903, when there
were 690 registrations. As there are al
ready about 650 applications for admis
sion, with a promise of more to come,
it is more than likely that the re'eord
will be overcapped.
Recitations in the classrooms will be

have been preparing for the reopening
of college for a week past, and will re
sume their studies in earnest to-mor

Magnitude of Human Transgression.
He Says, .Marks Every Feature of.
the Savior's Execution.
Dr. William R. Newell, the widely
known Bible instructor of the Moody
Institute. Chicago, addressed a meet
ing last evening in the Franklin street
Presbyterian Church. Dr. Newell,
who Is an eloquent, comprehensive and
forceful speaker, selected for his sub
ject the historical Incidents of the
crucifixion of the Savior. The trans
gression of man, he said, was an aw
ful sin when Christ, the second in the
trinity of heaven, came here to die on
the cross, the disgraceful gallows of
the ancient. "Every feature of that
execution," the speaker continued,
"marks the magnitude of the univer
sal sin that caused it. Even the Ro
man judge found Christ innocent but
condemned him to die In the place of
the robber Barrabas, who had been
adjudged guilty. The sin of the world
showed Itself everywhere In that
dreadful scene."

A misunderstanding between two
branches of machinists delayed work
at the Potrero branch of the San
Francisco Gas and Electrical Com

trouble grew out of the employment of
a few machinists who are not mem
bers of the Gas Workers* Union but
belong to another union in good stand
ing with the labor organization. The
difficulty was adjusted yesterday on
the arrival of Secretary Wisler of the
Labor Council, who informed Peter
Crowley, business agent of the Gas
Workers' Union, that the latter had
acted hastily in ordering the men to
quit work without submitting the
trouble to the regular arbitration
committee of the Labor Council.

The carbolic toddy was not strong

The girl had read about an acquain

She became morbid on the subject and
determined to die by the same meth
od. In the kitchen of her mother's

mixed the drink, which she thought
would prove fatal. I
Her mother found her lying on a

SPENDS DAY AT CHUTES
Members and Friends of the Organ

Favorite Resort.
The Young Men's Institute spent
yesterday at the Chutes. Business
prevented many members from at
tending in the afternoon, but in th*
evening there was a large gathering
of members and friends of the organ
ization, who enjoyed themselves at the
popular resort.
The purpose of the event was to
raise funds for improving thÂ» lodge
headquarters, which they will make
as comfortable as possible, so that
the members can spend their leisure
in a model lodgeroom.
No special programme was ar
ranged by the committee from the In

the Chutes was attractive. One-half
of the receipts taken in on certain
amusements went to the institute's
fund.
Every preparation is being mad*
for the session which Is to begin
Monday at Crockett. The institute
has grown -wonderfully since its or

cal body and now there are lodges
throughout the United States.

defendants for $50,000 damages, but
states that they are unable to respond

injured his personal, social and busi

Thomas Garret, publisher of the

noon obtained an order from Judg3
Kerrigan temporarily restraining the

tribution and containing charges re
flecting upon the publisher's life. Thf ;
restraining order also applies to the
wagon which was driven through the
streets yesterday carrying a ten by
fifteen foot canvas upon which was
lettered the advertisement of the
Stinger's intended contents. The court
requires Coffroth and the John Doe
defendants to show cause on Frldav,
August 26, why the injunction should
not be made perpetual.

"Chapin," said Councilman Howard,
"has asserted In his petition for a re
turn of the money that the franchise
had not been legally granted. Despite
that claim he has assigned a portion of
the franchise to the Oakland Transit.
He must set himself right."

PETERSBURG, Aug. 17. â The
announcement that the Mikado's offer
to allow non-combatants to leave
Port Arthur Is coupled with the de
mand for the surrender of the garri
son causes a revulsion of feeling here.
The original report that non-combat
ants would be permitted to depart be
fore the stormingr operations began
was regarded as a humane and con
siderate act.
The "War Office is without official-in
formation of the summons served
upon General Stoessel, but not the
slightest idea exists in military cir
cles that he will yield so long as food
and ammunition hold out without a
mand for Surrender.

JAPAN'S UI-/TI3IATUM TO CHINA.
Will Invade Shanghai Harbor Unless
Russians Are Forced to Leave.
LONDON, Aug. 17.â Japan has made
a demand on China, practically .in the
nature of an ultimatum, that she im
mediately enforce her neutrality in the
case of the protected cruiser Askold
and the torpedo-boat destroyer Grozo
vol. now at Shanghai. Japan pointed
out that the time limit, twenty-four
hours, permitted by International law,
had expired and that Japan, therefore,
was at liberty to take such action as
might seem to her expedient.
At the Japanese legation here it was
expected that the Tokio Government
had no intention of remaining quies
cent if Russia attempted to compel
China to give asylum to her men of
war, and authorize repairs at her ports
which would enable' them to resume
belligerent operations. Should Ohina
fail to comply immediately with Ja
pan's demand the divisicm of Japanese
warships now in the vicinity of Shang

structed to enter the port and capture
the Askold and Grozovol, as was done
In the case of the Ryeshitelni. Japan
has made no secret of her intention,
but has not consulted the powers, be
lieving that the question is one which
concerns herself albne, as Japan is pre
pared, the legation further asserts, to
recognize Chinese neutrality only so
long as it is respected by Russia,
With regard to the Ryeshitelni, Ja

comply with the Chinese demand sub

CHEFU, Aug. 17. â According to news

has been drawn still closer around be-'

of the Japanese line has penetrated to
the vicinity of Pigeon Bay, while the

Passengers on board the steamship
Decima, which anchored off Port Ar
thur last night, witnessed a bombard
ment from Pigeon Bay. The Japanese
shells were visible during their whole
course. They circled comet-like to the
town and their explosions were marked
by great splashes of 1 f.re which shot up
into the sky. The bombardment from
this and other points began at mid
night and lasted until morning. The
Russians did not reply to the Japanese
fire.
Major Seaman, formerly a surgeon
in the American army, was a passenger
on the Decima. He says the spectacle
was brilliant and awe-inspiring.
The Decima weighed anchor from
Port Arthur at 6 o'clock this morning.
At some distance out she saw five Jap

A CHARGE OF ROBBERY
{Xls Attorney Raises Important Points,
Which Will Be Argued on Motion
â¢ ' for \ew Trial.
Harry Howard was tried before a
Jury in Judge Cook's court yesterday
. on * a charge of robbery. The Jury
.was out about three minutes and re-
c turned a verdict of gruilty. The case
1 was submitted without argument, as
Howard's attorney, Hoff Cook, took
the ground that the objections made by
him would Invalidate the proceedings.
Argument on these objections will be
made on September 2, when Howard
Â¦will appear for sentence and a motion
for a new trial will be made.
The principal objection is that the
deposition of "William Little, the com
.plaining witness, taken at the prelim
inary bearing in Police Judge Mogan's
court, could not be read. Little has
'since died and the record did not show
tkat any reporter had been appointed

o Informed as to his rights.
" On tfae night of December 6 Howard

"We got the range . exactly," says
Commander Ogura, "and almost all

and fast until the sea was fairly boil
ing. Vice Admiral Togo remained on
the bridge of the Mikasa throughout

Commander Ogura's account agrees
remarkably with the story told by an
officer of the Russian battleship Cesar
evltch, sent by the Daily Telegraph's
correspondent at Tsingchou, which is
to the effect that the Mikasa opened
the fighting, but that the Russians be
gan the second attack at 2 o'clock.
The officer says that three 12-lnch
shells struck the Cesarevitch within
fifteen minutes, doing terrible damage
and causing, the vessel to tremble and
to travel rapidly in circles for ten min
utes until temporary repairs had been
executed. The first shell killed Rear
Admiral Wlthoeft and several other of
ficers; the second struck the conning
tower and killed everybody In its vi
cinity, while the third burst against
the foremast During the night the
Japanese torpedo boats * attacked the
Cesarevitch no fewer than five times.
"We saw the torpedoes fired," said
the officer. "They passed' very close
to us, but none struck us. All our
ships received serious damage and a
great fire broke out on the battleship
Peresviet. The engines and guns work
ed splendidly and there was no leak
age. The Krupp nine-inch armor pla.te
resisted the projectiles excellently and
the 12-lnch shells recoiled from it. Our
sailors cheerfully faced the storm of
red-hot iron."
The correspondent says that the Ce
sarevitch presented a ghastly spectacle
of wreckage, but that her guns ap
parently suffered no damage.

It is pointed out, however, that the
Ability of the American navy to secure
puch privileges during the Spanish war
by no means constitutes a positive as
sertion of the right of neutral nations
te accord them.
It is understood here" that England
will follow the course of the United
Ftatcs In holding aloof from these ques
tions now in dispute.
The Japanese are understood to ob
ject to being deprived of their lawful
property by the dismantlement of Rus
sian "ships in Chinese harbors, and also
â¢ in "tlje German harbor at Tsingchou;
tut fh the Spanish war the British Gov
ernment held an American torpedo
boat, the Sonmers, In asylum through
out the war.
The United States, if asked by Japan,
would have advised the return to Chefu
of the Ryeshitelni. The Japanese Gov
ernment was considered to be In the
wrong in entering the neutral port.
â¢ Despite this, how.ever. It is learned at
the State Department that no action
will be taken by the United States Gov
ernment. It does not feel called upon
to pess Judgment upon the three-cor
cered Question of a violation of neu
trality between Japan, Russia and Chi
na. It is realized that there are enough
precedents en all sides of the case to
afford an argument for each party.
The United States hitherto has recog
nized the right of belligerent ships to
seek refuge for less than twenty-four
hours in a neutral port, or If damaged
tor" remain there until repair* are com
pleted. As late as the Spanish war the
American scouts and gunboats made
frequent use of neutral ports In the
West Indies, notably Danish and Brit
ish ports, to communicate by cable
.vital the home povernment and Â¦with
"sections of the American fleet, yet there
was no charge that neutrality had been
violated.
The Japanese are understood to pro
test against the making of repairs to
Russian ships in Chinese harbors, yet
In the Spanish war the United States
f hip St. Paul spent nearly a week in a
French West Indian port repairing, and

lowed.
. CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17.â Japan's de
termination not to return to China the
Russian destroyer Ryeshitelni, captured
in the neutral i>ort of Chefu. is con
trary to what had been hoped here.
Japan's declaration that the Russian
worships now being permitted to repair
at Shanghai will be attacked within
lhat nautral harbor unless ordered out
at once is regarded as surely making
for further complications.
China's reply Is considered unsatis
factory by Russia, the main question â
What has China done to secure the
restoration of the Ryeshitelni?â remain-
Ing unanswered. Russia also demanded
the punishment of Admiral Sah.
pedo-boat destroyer v Grozovol at
Shanghai, especially after it was un
derstood that Russia had already
agreed to the disarmament of these
vessels, is regarded here more as a po
litical than a military move, the pur
pose of which is to overawe the Peking
Government and to compel it hence
forth to turn a deaf ear to Russia and
to recognize Japan as the dominant
power In the Far East, it being incon
ceivable that a Western power would
permit Japan to carry out her threat to
engage In hostilities in the neutral wa
ters of China.
China has applied to Russia's repre
sentations regarding the Ryeshitelni,
but her reply Is couched in general
terms, professing friendship and the
desire to preserve the strictest neutral
ity. It expresses disapproval of Ad
miral Sah's inability to protect the
Ryeshitelni, and represents that he took
all the precautions possible, but could
not prevent the night attack. The re
ply also says that one of the Japanese
destroyers was overhauled as she was
leaving the harbor and that a protest
was lodged against her action, in view
of which the Japanese captain prom
ised to return the Russian boat, but
did not do so. The reply does not say
the Ryeshltelni's restitution was de
manded.

fight, even to protect defenseless wom
en and other non-combatants from the
horrors of bombardment.
The views are practically those em
bodied In the King's speech at the pro
roguing of Parliament. The communi
cation takes exception to the Russian
doctrine that foodstuffs are contraband,
takes a position against the right of
Russia to sink neutral merchantmen
and demands compensation In the case
of the Knight Commander. With re
gard to foodstuffs consigned to an en
emy's ports, the communication main
tains that proof that they are intended
for a belligerent military or naval force
is necessary in order that they be con
sidered contraband. It illustrates In
this contention the case of the flour on
board the Arabia, which was consigned
to a British firm at Yokohama and
which was declared contraband by the
Vladivostok prize court. Great Britain
contends that the Russian doctrine is
equivalent to a declaration that all
foodstuffs consigned to an enemy's
port are unconditionally contraband.
The British note argues the question at
length against the right to sink neutral
ships, as being contrary to internation
al law and usage.
The communications of both govern
ments are couched In friendly terms.
They make the position of the United
States and Great Britain quite clear
and emphatic.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 17. â The
American and British representations
relative to foodstuffs have been re
ceived without resentment by the Rus
sian authorities and they are being
considered with the probability that
some modification will be made In the
direction of meeting the views of the
two governments.
The American case was presented
through Embassador McCormlck and
follows the lines of the American decla
ration at the time of the Spanish war.
It is in the form of a protest against
the confiscation of flour on board the
Arabia. The general American conten
tion regarding coal, naphtha, etc., as
set forth in Secretary Hay's note of
June 10 is also placed before the Rus
sian Government.
Great Britain followed by raising not
only the .question of foodstuffs as con
traband, but the legality of sinking
neutral ships. This communication was
presented through Embassador Har
dinge.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 17.â Tha
United States and Great Britain have
formally raised the question of food
stuffs as contraband of war except
when directly proved that they are des
tined for belligerents' armies or navies.
While acting on parallel lines, the
United States and Great Britain are
proceeding independently.

HAWTHORNE SELECTIONS.
PORTLAND, Aug. 17. â Six hits off
Baum In the sixth, coupled with some
ragged playing, netted the locals five
runs, offsetting the lead of five runs
which Los Angeles held until the
Browns landed on Baum so effective
ly. Gray relieved Baum, but could do
nothing with the Browns. In the first
inning a series of errors on the part
of Portland's Infield gave the Angels
four runs and they got another man
over the plate In the third. Their run
getting ceased in the third, but it was
mainly due to the wonderful work of
Steelman that four other men did not
cross the plate at various stages of
the game. The Portland catcher waa
invincible behind the bat, catching
four men at the plate and retiring
three batters on caught fouls. The
score:

ST. LOUIS SELECTIONS.
SEATTLE, Aug. 17. â Luck was
with Seattle in the eighth inning and
what looked like a sure victory for
Oakland was turned into a sensational
victory for the Siwashes. Oakland
took kindly to Pitcher Charley Hall
In the first part of the gume and then
again Charlie could not find the plate
on five occasions. A bad fumble of
an easy grounder was also charged
against him,
Oakland had five runs to Seattle's
one in the last of the eighth. When
it was over Seattle had seven and
Oakland still had five. In the eighth
Heattle sent twelve men to bat. yet
only three of them got hits. Bases on
balls and errors by Kruger and Mos-
o klman gave Seattle the victory. It
"was hard luck, because he had pitched
magnificent ball up to that unfortun
ate inning. Score:

If Mike Fisher can stow away about
half the luck that was his lot yesterday
at Recreation Park the pennant is his
for a srif t- The trainer of the great
* jungle monsters invaded this city after
-'an absence that has made the heyts
of some fans grow fonder and others
bitter. He quietly slipped away with
the game and the luck, and did all the
stalling and orating after the fight had
been won. Score â Tacoma 2, San Fran
cisco 1.
Sheehan drove a clever little single
out to right field, and Nordyke sacri
ficed him along a bit., Truck Eagan
just managed to lay his bat against
cne that went out of Gochnauer'e reach,
and this sent Sheehan around to sack
three. Lynch listed a fly to deep cen
ter and Sheehan hotfooted to the pan.
Casey saw his chance and responded
with one to center, bringing Truck over
the last Jump with the one that won
the game for Mike.
Sun Francisco landed for three solid
hits, a double and a triple in the sixth,
end Btill there was no run. Hildebrand
drove a grand two-bagger to the flag
pole. He was nailed by many feet at
the plate when he tried to score on
Meany's drive to right. Van Buren
a slow one over the third bag.
but it was not long enough to bring
Meany in. Had Hildebrand been kept
at third the game might have been
won there.
The eighth produced the only run,
and it looked bad for a while at that.
"VValdron hit and so did Meany, but it
was the same old story in the same old
way till Irwin planted a two-bagger
against the center field fence. Waldron
arrived, but Pat went to his doom on a
good relay throw â Lynch to Casey to
Graham.
In the ninth the Tigers took a grand
aerial ascension, but still old mother
luck refused to be touted to desert. An
derson was given a life on Eagan's
fumble, and Gochnauer was there with
his bunt again. Casey dropped Gorton's
fly, making two on the sacks, with but
cne to the bad. Barber was too anx*
ious and tried to wallop the first ball,
producing naught but a pop up. Wal
dron had little better left, so it ended
right there. The score:

McGrath has decided to work his
miner as hard as he can go till next
Monday, when the training win be
wound up with ten fast and furious
rounds. Then Munroe will rest and pa
tiently await the moment when the bell
brings him face to face with the man
who has met and beaten all the nota
bles but himself.
After being rubbed down by Tim Mc-
Grath, the chief of staff, the miner
looked great. Every muscle of his body
showed plainly and his flesh had a real
healthy look about It.
Even though the spirits of the "Kid"
were not as high as they have been on
other occasions and in other places, th.i
miner made up for any^lack of spright
linesa on his adviser's part. He was
never more full of life and ginger and
he never bustled his sparring partners
around harder than he did yesterday
afternoon.
The ever reliable and consistent Andy
Gallagher waa called upon first to en
gage Munroe. The way the, miner start
ed In puzzled Andy. He could not un
derstand why the big fellow did not
come In and mix it. and therefore he
commenced to set the pace and shoot
'em in fast in order to awaken the
aspirant for championship honors from
his apparent fit of dopinesa.
The change came when the second
round was about half over. Munroe
suddenly cut loose and wallop after
wallop he shot at the astonished Gal
lagher. It was then the latter discov
ered that the miner had been stalling
all the time and was playing the foxy
game. At first he seemed content with
blocking: the hot ones sent at him and
not being able to come back. "When he
did open up he surprised every one in
the gym, including his trainers. There
was steam behind every blow and he
winged them in fast enough to make
the agile Gallagher do some hotfooting
to get out of the corners.
Sullivan followed, and he was ham
mered around the ring for two rounds
by the husky miner. At that, Sullivan
did some boxing in himself and let the
miner know occasionally that he waa
still in the going. It waa a good, fast
two rounds, and the miner showed a lot
of speed In following the smaller man
about and blocking his jabs and swings.
Chester was the last man to get his.
He was also rushed around the ring at
a lively pace by Munroe, who was will
ing to take a couple of punches In order
to land one.
The talk of "Kid" McCoy's doings at
Camp Munroe has set the sporting pub
lic astir, and naturally every man whj
is interested in the outcome of the big
fight has a longing: to see just what the
"Kid" is doing to make a champion oui
of one Jack Munroe. Accordingly a
motley throng gathered at the Beach
Tavern yesterday afternoon, despite thu
wind and the cold and the general tin
pleasantness of the atmosphere.
Every one was doomed to a spell of
disappointment, for the much-touted
"Kid" waa not feeling right. He did
not don the mitts with his pupil, but
contented himself with looking at the
others engage in the practice battles,
making a valuable suggestion occasion
ally.

The closest finish during the after
noon was in the second heat of the 2:20
pace. Three horses, Tom Carneal, Cav
alier and Gertie A were fighting it out
coming down the stretch. Under the
wire the three horses' noses were side
by side, and it took the judges some
time to decide the heat. "When the win
ner was announced it was found Tom
Carneal had received the decision and
the other two were placed in the order
named. The time was 2:13.
The first heat of the 2:24 class trot
proved another interesting race. H D B
won from Walter Wilkes by a nose.
The latter horse broke badly just after
the start, and this gave H D B a lead
that was hard to overcome. If this
break had not occurred the heat would
have been at least three seconds faster.
The time was 2:1J.

0 As long as the Doric v.as in port and
in a position to receive freight all ship
ments for ports in the war zone were
refused. The Doric is loaded, and to
<iay at 1 o'clock will sail for the Far
Hast with a large carro shipped at regr
â¢ular freight rates. There is rich profit
in carrying contraband, or even ques
tionable cargo, and the Manchuria is
to reap the first haxvest.
She is now loading larg-e quantities
of jsteel for Japan, and tn addition is to
carry machinery and foodstuffs, includ
f^C-a large shipment of barley.
The Manchuria will have room for all
the Japanese freight offering at pres
ent, so the Aztec, which was to have
taken a part cargo here, will go in bal
last" to Portland, where she will load
for Japan.

A traveler from Egypt, recently among us, has satis
fied his faculties of observation far enough to remark*
that .the agriculturists of the Nile are- immeasurably
superior' to those of f American fields and farms because
his people have neither holidays nor Sundays in which
to bow to idleness.nor during, which: to seek- recreation.
Yet -.after they have done all they may do the Egyptians
can only- eat, drink, sleep and clothe their nakedness?
Their representative is certainly doing much to prove
that their future; will be as dark as has been r their 'past.

LIQUEFACTION OF GASESâSub
scriber, City. Farraday. the renowned
chemist, had a theory that by generat
ing gases under high pressure they
could be turned into a liquid state.
Practical experiments proved hia
theory to be correct. Gases produced
in this way in strong bent glass tubes
continued liquid a,t low temperatures
while the pressure was maintained, but
when the pressure was removed by
breaking the tube they instantly
passed into a gaseous state. In thia
way before 1822 he succeeded in
liquefying chlorine, sulphurated hydro
gen," nitrous oxide, hydrochloric and
other gases. He is credited with be
ing the first who had a practical re
sult in this matter.
AT the annual conference of the British Sanitary
Institute, recently held in the University of Glas
gow, industrial hygiene was the theme of discus r
sion, rich in comparisons for.the student of American in
dustrial conditions. The picture of the life and environ
ment of British workingmen, dark and dismal and; un
promising of either reform or redress, painted by intelli-^
gent and painstaking investigators, points to the ob
server of diametrically opposed facts in the same rela
tive field in the United States a serious and sad moraj.
British inquiry, faithfully made, finds' that fatigue, al
cohol and tubercle are working the ruin of the working
men of England, Scotland and Wales. Bad housing,
slum life, improper feeding 'and excessive indulgence in*
alcohol by both sexes are enfeebling the , race and making
it a prey to the operation of those causes ;that produce
disaster, to commercial prosperity and death to the phy
sical, ; moral and mental health of the productive class
upon which the future of the kingdom inevitably de
pends. ;
British workingmen, these inquirers, decide, go to their
work, unprepared and unrefreshedarid ileave it fatigued,
with wasted energies unreplaced ; by:proper:food, and fur
ther harmed by^ poorly ventilated, overcrowded habita
tions or the seductions of the dram shop "and the" music
PAINTING A DISMAL PICTURE.
RAISING FROGSâ A. C. R.. Ceres,
Cal. The species of frog used for food
in Europe is the common green frog.
It abounds greatly in ponds and slow
streams in France, Southern Ger
many and Italy. The frogs are caught
in great number in nets and put into
large inclosed ponds, or "froggeries."
where they are fed until wanted for
the table. The flesh of the frosr is
regarded as most delicate In the fall.
The food of the frogs ia principally
insects, but when In f roggeries . they
are fed upon breaji crumbs and fresh
meat cut Into very small nieces. The
bullfrog, an American species, is also
cultivated for the table.
In England the tax would have been
far heavier. Under the act of 1894 an
estate of over $5,000,000 pays 8 per cent
oa the entire estate, real or personal,
settled or not settled. The "estate
duty," or inheritance tax, if Mr. Whit
ney had lived In England, would have
been $1,760,000, or eight times larger
than -the largest inheritance tax levied
in this country.- Yet there are; many
who Imagine that under democratic
conditions large properties are likely to
be more severely dealt with than
abroad.
William C Whitney left a fortune of
$22,220,000. It is assessed in New York
State a legacy, duty of $222,000.
This Is the largest Inheritance tax
which would have been paid on this
fortune anywhere in this country, New
York levying a' tax both on direct in
heritance as well as. on collateral be
quests.
A Big Inheritance Tax.
A local preacher, analyzing modern conditions, de
plores the fact that the devil as a personal entity en
dowed with powers not comfortable to the vision of
wrongdoers is fast disappearing from the mind of man,
and with him is vanishing that fear that keeps most of
us in the straight and narrow path. Let the worthy
speaker of the good word take consolation, however, in
the knowledge that the world yet holds many men and
women whose morals never have been founded upon a
plane of rewards or punishment and never will be. Fear
is neither reformation nor regeneration.
SWEAT BOXâ Subscriber. City. A
"sweat box," in police parlance, is not
"a box in which a prisoner is placed,
the steam turned on and allowed to re
main there until he Is ready to con
fess." When the police of this or any
other city have a suspect he is usually
placed in a solitary cell, and if he is
guilty of the crime charged against
him his conscience will make him
sweat, but if he is innocent his con
finement In a solitary cell may make
him fret, but not sweat, as the police
understand that term.

After all the resources of the kingdom
of Italy have been devoted to bring
ing to Justice the ex-Member of Par
liament Palizzolo, charged with the
murder of Senator" the Marquis Notar
bartolo, his conviction having been
secured with no end of trouble, the
sentence condemning him to lifelong
imprisonment has been annulled and
the man restored to liberty. Acknowl
edged chief of the Mafia in Sicily, an
island whose metropolitan city of Pal
ermo he represented in the national
Legislature, he has shown in a singu
larly striking fashion that his powers
as chief, of one of the greatest crimi
nal secret organizations In the world
Is superior to that of Parliament, of
the administration and of the crown.
And with the demonstration of the ex
traordinary influence â¢ of the Mafia
constituted by Palizzolo's restoration
to freedom before their eyes Italians
not only in the peninsula, but all the
world over, will now be more reluc
tant than ever to place themselves in
the position of antagonism to this so
ciety by according to the authorities
any assistance whatsoever in their
proceedings against it.
Every one in Italy knows thatPaliz
zelo is the chief of the Mafia. There
has never been any secret made about
the matter, and Crispi, when Premier,
was wont to treat with him as the po
litical "boss" of the island of Sicily In
order to secure the return of mem
bt-rs disposed to support the Govern
ment in the Chamber of Deputies. So
frightened were the people, not only
of the lower classes, but even of the
highest social, official and political
rank, to testify against him in the
Notarbartolo murder case and to thus
incur his enmity that it was found
necessary to change the venue of the
! trial several times, the case being
Â¦eventually heard first at Milan and
: then at Bologna. Â¦â Each trial lasted
for months and in spite of the intimi
dation of the witnesses and their re
luctance to give any testimony the
evidence produced in court was so
strong as to leave no alternative but
conviction.
Undismayed, Palizzolo's lawyers se
cured appeals on the ground of certain
technical Informalities during the
course of the proceedings. On the
strength of these, the verdict and the
sentence of life imprisonment were
quashed and a third trial ordered at
Florence. This has Just been brought
to a close after lasting nearly a year by
a verdict diametrically opposed to all
the facts proved at' the previous trial
at Bologna and by which a badly
frightened Jury acquits the prisoner
and restores him to liberty, as the say
ing is, ."without a stain upon his char
acter." The entire island of Sicily
professes to- be wild with . enthusiasm
and delight at his acquittal , and the
leading citizens of Palermo, includini
The Deadly Mafia.
The assassination of M. de Plehwe
brings vividly to mind the personal
peril to which rulers and other promi
nent men are exposed and the elab
orate system of police espionage by
which most of them are. surrounded.
In Russia the whole machinery of gov
ernment is primarily devoted to safe
guarding the imperial family. It is the
duty of every official, military and civil,
to think first of his royal master and
then of his other duties. The safety of
the Emperor Is a sufficient excuse for
setting aside, when necessary, any law
or regulation. The army and police are
in their entirety his bodyguards. Regi
ments of soldiers are stationed near
each palace, and selected troops are de
tailed for duty in courtyards and
buildings.
In addition to the regular uniformed
police, who patrol the streets with par
ticular care when the Czar Is passing,
there is a large body of secret police,
whose duty it is to discover and frus
trate any possible plot against him.
They have agents in Berlin, London,
Paris, Buenos Ayres, New -York, Chi
cago and Paterson, N. J. Spies are in
every city in Russia and In every de
partment of life. When the Czar trav
els other people "wait. Between St.
Petersburg and Tsarskoe Selo a special
line, with a private station at each end,
has been built for the exclusive use of
the imperial family. Every. yard of It
Is guarded constantly, and particularly
when a train is to pass. -^
Guarding the Czar.
IN another column a correspondent, qualified by pro
fession and experience to judge, suggests an immedi
ate local application of- the recommendations we have
made for the proper sanitation of vehicles of transporta
tion. Reform in this connection rests solely with the
public. What it demands will J certainly be granted by
the street railroad companies, which, fortunately for San
Francisco, are disposed to render to the traveling public
an efficient service.
Our .street railroad companies have been quick to meet
the exigencies of traffic. They have instituted necessary
reforms in their service to relieve the congested hours of
the day. Cars travel on a more frequent headway than
before, new districts have been tapped to develop the
outlying and rapidly growing sections of the city, and
conveniences, urged solely by the desire of these cor
porations to please their patrons, have been, established.
Precedent is eloquent, therefore, for the institution of a
reform far more important and vital to public interest
than any one of these. The public, however, must take
the initiative.
Where men and women congregate physical condi
tions must be healthful or disease will be the inevitable
result. When the public understands and values the
knowledge that" in dust there is death the demand .for
clean, well ventilated, thoroughly washed and sunlit
street cars will be insistent or patronage will be with
drawn at whatever cost of inconvenience to those that
care not to accept the hazard of disease and death in their
most treacherous encroachment. -
The traveling public certainly should need no further
education on this subject. The infectious character of
tuberculosis is beyond controversy. In every commun
ity the disease presents a problem far more serious in its
cost to the state than the manifold obligations of admin
istration of public affairs. It is estimated that this dis
ease alone costs the United States the staggering annual
tctal of more than three hundred millions of dollars.
Yet the host of tuberculosis is the dust of the street.
Jn a variety of ways the germs are carried into the street
cars, where nearly, every resident of the city passes some
of his time every day in the year. Our.city government
has accomplished a great measure of reform by fixing'a
certain"penalty for the offense of expectorating in street
cars. This surely is wise. Some European communities
go even so far as to prohibit women from wearing, trail
ing gowns on public thoroughfares.
What has been done should be accepted as only so
much gained in a campaign yet to be won for public
health. The street railroad companies should be made to
understand that clean cars, thoroughly and duly Vashed,
cars unincumbered by useless, dust accumulating orna
ments, cars daily exposed to light and_ sunshine, and cars
as scrupulously free from dust and dirt as the reception
room of a home, are the only vehicles in which the pub
lic of: San Francisco will ride.
vSuch:a reform in public service, so eminently desir
able, may be accomplished iin a variety of ways. Patrons
of each car line- who ride regularly within a certain dis
trict should interest themselves in a cause that is the
'more vital because it is too little understood. These peo
ple" can organize to protect their health, they may peti
tion the corporations for. reforms that are necessary', and
they must receive the assurance of an acquiescence to
their reasonable demands;
Alone, adrift 'mid stress and change,
I tune my soul to hopeful lays â

CLEAN OUR STREET CARS.
Since 1S51 Ireland has lost through
emigration over 4,000,000 of her popula
tion, and a very large proportion of
those remaining are weak and ineffi
cient. But there is now an agitation
to stop the drain for fear that the
country may become too weak for re
covery. In England the birth rate is
steadily declining. In 1S66 the birth
rate was 35.2 per 1000; in 1S31 it had
fallen to 31.57; in 1S97 to 29.7, and in
1903 to 28.5. This condition* would have
been worse excepting for the Influx of
poor Hebrews and others who, from
their manner of living, have driven the
British out of some parts of the city of
London. Marriages have decreased,
and unless something is done to stop
the decadence there is no telling what
the result may be. That is one thing
that gives strength to the Chamberlain
agitation. The British colonies are
vigorous, but the emigration from "the
old country" and the more vigorous
competition of other nations are hav
ing their effect in weakening, in some
respects, the United Kingdom.
England's Danger.
The disquieting, report that England has seized Bird
Island, in the West Indies, as a preliminary measure "of
her policy to protect the interests of her subjects in
Venezuela proves after all to have be'en without foun
dation. Until the great question of what constitutes con
traband of war in the eyes of the nations has been set
tled to satisfy British opinion, or the Czar's war fleets
have been swept from the seas, we may rest easy that
England will do nothing to offend her good and dear
friend, the United States.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: Sin
cerely thanking you on behalf of the
San Francisco public for the excellent
and very apropos editorial article in
your issue of to-dayâ "Death in the
Coaches"â permit me to suggest In that
connection that we should commence
the reform at home. Our street cars
are all In an unsanitary condition, for
they are never sufficiently cleansed.
Judging from their appearance. It
would seem as if the steam cars on tha
California street line extension have
never yet come in contact with water,
unless they may possibly have soma
time been .out in the rain; but they
have never/ apparently, been properly
â¢cleaned at any time and are a disgrace
to that company and an eyesore to the
city. Befora our Eastern visitors arrive
all the street cars should be thoroughly
overhauled anil cleansed, and then be
kept in a good condition. Cannot we
have another editorial touching on this
branch of the subject at issue? Yours
truly, D. ALBERT HILLER, M. D.
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 15.

of the Irish party know that he is not
going out this time with an altogether
light heart. A member of the party
has been in the. United States for
months and, as far as dollars are con
cerned, with most disappointing re
sults. Redmond himself is despondent
with regard to the future of the party.
He makes no secret of the fact that he
beHeves the numerical strength will be
materially reduced, but what troubles
him most are the finances. American
purse-strings are practically closed
and he is going out to try personally
to reopen them.
The movement which he controls
In Ireland Is as dead as the proverbial
doornail. The people have got sick of
the land agitation business and they
are instead applying themselves to
the industrial revival, which does not
make such demands upon their pa
tience or tempers. A remark made by
President Roosevelt a few weeks ago
to an' Irish- press representative has
caused much uneasiness in the ranks
of the Irish Parliamentary party. The
President said he was astonished at
the progress the Gaelic movement was
making in the United States. This
movement has alienated the sym
pathies of thousands of Irishmen and
wemen both in England and Ireland
from John Redmond's party.
Mr. Redmond Is going out to see
whether the President's observations
were Justified by the facts, 'if funds
are not forthcoming from some source
a reduction of the party in the House
of Commons will be inevitable.

cal trial, Just concluded, of Russian
icpUclty and the undignified zeal
shown by thÂ» German Government to
enrry favor with the C*ar by the sacri
fice of flomt of lta own subjects.
The prisoners, nine In number, were
â¢II men In the lower walks of life. Most
of them could neither read nor write.
They lived near the Russian border in
East Prussia, a district from which,
with the connivance of the corrupt
Russian police, a brisk business Is done
In smuggling goods Into the dominion
cf the Czar. They were accused, firstly,
with being concerned In a conspiracy
cr secret society; secondly, of circulat

murder of the Czar and the overthrow
of the Russian constitution, and, third
ly, of being guilty of lese Tnajeste

this period the German authorities were

There was an Indignant rustle of
skirts and the managing editor reached
out for a cigarette to cheer him in his
solitude.
Not long ago the columns of print
that appeared under her name were
eagerly sought as being the very salt
of San Francisco's Journalistic
achievements. Everybody knew her,
through her work at least, and every
body hung upon her written words as
oracles. The envied of all her sister
craftsmen of the pad and the admired
of every newspaper man from manag
ing editor to cub. this lady held su
preme sway as long as the spirit
moved her.
/But in one way she was a terror to
the business office. Nobody could put
in an expense account of such ampli
tude as did this particular starâcar
riage hire, messenger boys, special
"incidentals" â truly the business office
would sit up of nights in mute rage.
It happened that the inaugural ball
up in Sacramento was assigned to the
lady with instructions that she should
"do it up brown."
She did.
When her expense account went into
the busjness office at the end of the
week there was this item which caused
the business manager to sit up and
take notice:
"A ball gown, 575."
Well, the business office would not
pass that item. When the irate lady
writer brought it before the managing
editor he had been forewarned.
"Now, miss," he began in his suavest
; tones, "we will be very glad to admit
this item in your little account. The
ball gown was probably as necessary
to you in covering the story as this
Item here indicates carriages to have

that may arise," continued the editor
in honeyed tones, "we will Just have

NEGROES in an out-of-the-way place in Georgia
committed an atrocious murder. The victims were!
a white family. The criminals were caught, had a
prompt trial in court, were convicted upon evidence and
their own confessions, and were sentenced to death. The
time of execution was set near to the conviction, and
there was no appeal taken. from the verdict of \the jury
and the judgment of the court. It was a most commend
able instance of the prompt administration of justice.
The majesty of the law was vindicated, and society war
protected by the prompt punishment of \ the^guilty. In
all of its features this calm and quick action of criminal
justice might well serve as an example to other States,*
where it is complained that the mob spirit is roused by
judicial delays and the quibbling of lawyers. But the
good example' and the excellent effect to be expected
from it are destroyed by what followed.
A furious mob rose, attacked the jail that was de
fended by militia, and by seizing the guns of the soldiers
found that they were not loaded. Thereupon the troops
were overpowered by sheer force of numbers, and, by
the connivance of the deputy sheriff, the mob seized the
wretched criminals, took them into the fields, tied them
to a stump, poured kerosene on them and burned 1 them
to death. The act was accompanied by unusual evidences
of savagery, and the negroes expiated their crime under
circumstances of peculiar barbarity.
It has been argucd\ with much force to Northern
audiences that burning negroes at the stake -for an un
speakable crime is justified because it^saves their victim
the capital humiliation of describing the crime in a
court of justice. We admit that there is sympathy for
this view of it, and that feeling is tolerant of the method
pursued to rid the world of a monster. But none of this
entered into the cause or excuse of this last mob. The.
victims of murder were dead. Their slayers had con
fessed, were convicted, and stood within the shadow of
the gallows without the least hope of escape. Justice
Even the human desire for revenge had been .satisfied
by the praiseworthy action of the court. A normal com
munity should have been more, than satisfied. It should
i have been proud that the existence of law and the mani
festation of its power to right all wrongs had been jus
tified. But that Georgia community was not satisfied,
land took into its own hands the execution of a legal
judgment and proceeded to itself commit. a' crime more
horrible than the one it avenged.
All the conclusions to be drawn from the incident are
discouraging. We put no weight into the condemnation
because it happened in the South. We offer no indict
ment of a section. We deplore it because it took place
I in the United States, in a republic where the law is the
sole avenger of crime and the sole protector of all rights.
While the miserable blacks suffered the torment of fire
and had their distorted lives licked up by flames, suffer
ing tortures that language cannot describe, the law was
also burned at that stump ia Georgia. The law had
done its duty, promptly, severely and well. It had be
come entitled to the allegiance and respect of the people,
but it had neither. It was as despitefully treated as it
it had failed and fallen short in the/discharge of its func
tion.
It is the' first case of the kind that we can recall.
Where juries have failed to do their duty and courts
have seemed to respect more the letter than the spirit of
the law, communities have lost patience and have taken
the matter m their own hands. But here there- was no
default, no failure, no hesitation, no technical delay.
But the law, having done all, failed to satisfy and was
repudiated and shamed. It is a sorry case and one that
cannot be excused by any of the arguments that have
ever been made to justify lynching. The mob murdered
whom the law had condemned to the gallows, and the
law suffered.
The effect cannot fait to be bad in every aspect. The
negroes Â«are made worse by it. Whatever savage fiber
remains in them will be inflamed. It is notice to them
that they are outside the law, not subject to its methods
and not even the. beneficiaries of its condemnation. In
stead of making the whites safer, it exposes them to
greater danger. It sets up the rule of life for life, out
side the law. Events are in evidence to prove that the ,
ignorant, poor and criminal 'element among the South
ern blacks are not in the: least restrained by lynching.
Burning them to. death has not restrained a single crim
inal, nor averted a single tragedy. The mob has accom
plished nothing in the way of admonition of criminals
and restraint of crime. It is a useless- method. It in
jures those who apply more than those who^ suffer it,
for they are dead, while their tormentors live to suffer
the weakening effect of their crime upon the law, which
is the protector of their own rights.
lawTin which this reciprocity was al
leged to be guaranteed. But the wily
official omitted from his transcript the
saving clause which demands that the
reciprocity must be explicitly guaran
teed by treaty. An express under
standing of this sort exists only be
tween Russia and Austria. There is
no such treaty between Russia and
Germany. In law, therefore, no pro
ceedings could He against these Ger-,
man subjects . for inciting sedition
among the Czar's subjects. And had
the prosecution been successful Ger
many would have had no guarantee
that Russia would undertake to prose
cute Russians who might try to sow
the seeds of sedition In Germany. The
net result of the trial has been a great
waste of money and a humiliating ex
posure of the .German Government's
anxiety to do anything to please the
Czar.
ANOTHER MOB.
hall. Drudgery and overwork, followed' by the necessary
consequence of a taste for stimulants and a desire for
unhealthy recreation and excitement, are the dreary
cause and effect which British observers find, inherent
in British industrial conditions.'
While painting this terrible picture of the working
men and women of Britain the Sanitary Institute is not
poor in recommendation of reform, however unwise we
may think it to be, in -not seeking suggestion from Amer
ican policy that has met and conquered most of the
evils that so afflict our British brethren. The institute
suggests a regulation of home work as a mitigation of
the distressing evils of the day. A measure, designed
to prohibit any process of v manufacture in dwelling
houses that fall below a certain level of cleanliness and
airiness and to limit workers in any given space to the
proportion of one person to every two hundred and fifty
cubic feet of air, will be submitted to Parliament. Under
the provisions of this bill each worker must receive from
a duly authorized commission a certificate or license to
work in his home,, and without this license no employer
may give out work to be done anywhere except on hi*
own premises." ',;
An urgent plea is made for the limitation of working
hours and formic suppression or modification of that
nightmare of'Â» the workingman in every land under the
sun, the process of sweating. And here the Sanitary In
stitute closes*' its* suggestions, except for the recommen
dation, casually fmade and apparently little thought of
even by those that advance it, that the cure for the grave
evils of long hours of labor in a vitiated atmosphere re
quires organized effort on the part- of the workers, aided
by practical legislation limiting the hours of work.
It is here that the first step in the solution of the
problem must be taken. Let our British brethren look
upon the workingmen of the kingdom as the people of
the United States look npon theirs, as a dignified ele
ment of the body politic, a constituent, intelligent part of
the nation, contributing to its prosperity and greatness
and competent to urge legislation that must advance its
interests and assist its capacity for production. The
workingman is not of a class himself, but is of the whole
people, uniting with other elements and influences to
produce the greatest good. He is patient of suggestion,
but his power is in an intelligent, conservative initiative
in affairs that vitally concern his own condition.

Lucy Fischer from John H. Fischer Jr.
of the Fischer Packing Company, on
Commercial street, because of his cru
elty. They were married a year ago
and she charged that he compelled her
to live in a small room in a cheap
lodging-house, and only visited her in
frequently. He would not take her on
the streets except at night and declined
to introduce her to his friends and rela
tives.
DIVORCES GRANTED.
Other suits for divorce were filed by
Jane Whitaker against Ellsworth
Whitaker. neglect; Emma G. Byers
against Harry R. Byers, desertion (the
day after marriage): Matie E. Van
Housen against Harrington Van Hou
sen. cruelty: Bertha E. Doyle against
Harry Doyle, cruelty; Charles McGinn

M. Lee against W. B. Lee, neglect;
Hermine Grunewald against Emll
Grunewald. cruelty; A. M. Barley
against Catherine Barley, cruelty-
Mary D. Imperial against Albert F.
Imperial, cruelty; Carrie Lunnette
James against Joseph James, cruelty.
In the latter case four-year-old twins
are the Issue of the union and the hus
band was, for many years, an employe
of the Central Grain and Stock Ex
change.
Emma Strauss answers her hus
band's suit for divorce for desertion
with a counter charge that he has been
unfaithful and is now living with a wo
man named Ella at 131 Seventh street-
Joseph D. Good, who was employed
at 128 Broadway, New York, did not
live up to his name in the eyes of the
law, according to the action com
menced against him in the r Superior
Court yesterday by Catherine M. Good,
who thought she was his wife. He mar
ried her in New York on September 30,
1503, and she later discovered that he
had another wife named Coralie Good,
whom he married at Camden, N. J., on
November 13, 1902. The victim of the
alleged bigamist declares that he left
New York about six months ago and
was last heard from at Montreal, Can
ada-
TWICE MARRIED.
A busy day in the courts was yester
day in matters affecting the welfare of
mismated couples'. Twelve new suits
for divorce and one for annulment of
marriage were filed, eleven divorces
were granted, a cross-complaint was
recorded and a woman who was denied
a divorce on Monday asked the court
to reconsider its decision.
In the case last mentioned Dina
Smtth Is the aggrieved person. She
sued Andrew Smith, who rents horses
and wagons to peddlers, on the ground
of neglect. Judge Hunt declined to
grant the decree when the husband tes
tified that he was willing to fulfill his
marriage contract. According to her
affidavit for a rehearing, the wife went
to his place of business on Tuesday and
he received her with vile words and
was about to strike her with a wagon
spoke when she warded the blow.
Among the new suits died, that of
Anna Catherine McCausland against
William J. McCausland, a journeyman
carpenter, sets forth a domestic trag
edy. They were married in 1S99 and
lived happily until he took to drink and
"changed his nature." Then a girl
named Carrie Love came upon the
scene as a guest of the husband's aunt
and uncle. Then William, who had
been in the habit of coming home early,
took to staying out late, and usually in
the company of his wife's rival. She
opened a letter from Carrie to William
and its terms of endearment were the
last straw.
Marie Merkel, who married Sebastian
Merkel in 1S95, sues him for divorce on
the ground of cruelty, which, she says,
commenced in 1*SS and continued in
specified instances up to the present
year. He owns $8000 worth of Mission
street realty, $5000 in other property
and has 5C0OO in bank. She wants $100
a month.
Din a Smith Says Husband
Coaxed Her Home, Then
Drew Wagon Spoke on Her
GOOD HAS TWO WIVES
Then the defendant mounted the wit
ness stand, and after winking know
ingly at Clerk Barney Conlan informed
the court that she was a good Demo
crat, Bryanesque in national Issues,
with a leaning toward the "Horses and
Carts" faction of the local party. As
for Mrs. Annie's accusations, she would
like to have Mrs. Terry, then in court,
refute them. Which was done as well
as Mrs. Terry could do it â even to the
extent of asserting that while under the
Influence of beer Mrs. Julia was arhla
blllty personified, a fact known to
Terry through her having drunk from
th<? same "growler" with Mrs. Julia.
"They* drank from the samecanteen,"
"'It was impossible to put up with
her ways.',' Mrs. Annie testified. "Good
ness knows, I did my best to endure
her and preserve peace in the family,
but the more I forgave and tried to
forget the harder she rubbed it in.
When she wasn't drunk she was try
ing to borrow money to buy drink,
and every time she got drunk she want
ed to run the house. I had her arrested
because she disturbed the peace of
the neighbors as well as mine."
All of which was fully corroborated
by William John Duffy, who boards
with Mrs. Annie, but is not related by
blood to any of the parties in the case.
It was no part of Mrs. Annie Duffy's
wedding compact that she take a moth
er-in-law into her household, but she
filed no objection when her husband
proposed that his maternal relative be
installed as a permanent inmate ot the
new home which he had established in
Guy place, a short cul-de-sac shooting
westward from First street, between
Folsom and Harrison. Although
the young bride had read and heard
much about the discomfort of having
one's husband's mother constantly in
.domestic evidence, she had no misgiv
ing concerning her ability to dwell in
amity with Mamma Duffy, whose tem
peramental sweetness was enthusias
tically vouched for by her son.
"She is not the mother-in-law depict
ed in the comic papers and described
by the stage monologists," said Mr.
Duffy, "and you'll find her experience
as a housekeeper of great help to you,
to say nothing of her charm as a com
panion while I am absent."
So It was with a happy heart that
the younger woman welcomed the elder
and exerted herself to make their rela
tionship mutually pleasant. The best
room was given to Mamma Duffy, and
Mamma Duffy had the choice seat at
table and the daintiest portions of the
food. There was nothing too good for
Mamma Duffy. All that worried Mrs.
Annie was a fear that she might over
look some means by which she could
contribute to Mamma Duffy's bliss.
That care, however, gradually ceased
to canker, the alleviating cause
being Mamma Duffy's conduct.
Mamma Duffy, in fact, proved posses
sion of all the traits ascribed to moth
ers-in-law by the funny writers and
artists and actors. She likewise re
vealed a few that were hers exclusive
ly. Among the latter, according to
Mrs. Annie's testimony yesterday be
fore Police Judge Cabaniss, were a pas
sionate fondness for alcoholic stimu
lants and an annoying habit of bor
rowing small sums of money and
neglecting to pay her creditors. As for
nagging. Mamma Duffy fairly reveled
in it.
Policemen McGowan and Condon
packed a valise with wooden blocks
and left It at the ferry station as a de
coy for a thief who had made a special
ty of stealing gripsacks and their ex
periment was rewarded by the capture
of Robert Benson. He will be sen
tenced to-day by Judge Cabaniss.
Charles Kaiser, engaged to -marry a
young woman whose name did not
come out in testimony, went to 2030
Fillmore Btreet to remove his fiancee's
trunk from her apartment to the new
home he had prepared for her, and
while carrying the trunk upon his back
he missed his footing at the head of
the stairway and fell to the bottom,
the trunk atop of him. His face was cut
and body badly bruised, but he valiantly
resumed his task and stuck to It until
he had conveyed the trunk to its des
tination. Then he got drunk and
while in that condition was arrested.
Case continued by Judge Cabaniss.
"William Ferguson, a marine fireman,
who was born and bred In merry Eng
land, was arrested by Patrolman J.
Nelson, of Scandinavian nativity, for
battering F. TV. Kahrau, whose eyes
first opened in Germany, and Judge
Cabaniss heard the polyglot testimony.
The alleged assault occurred in the
Kahrau residence, 566 Folsom street,
and Mrs. Kahrau and her three
daughtersâ Jennie, Emma and Flos
sie â testified that Mr. Ferguson, while
visiting the family In a sociable way.
suddenly became turbulent and after
striking and knocking down all the
female witnesses, attacked the hus
band and father, blackening both his
eyes and delivering some hard body
blows. Mr. Ferguson has reserved his
defense till next Tuesday, when he will
have "William Lautle, a compatriot and
brother stoker, who Is now at sea, on
hand to testify that the beating of the
Kahraus was provoked.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Annie Atwood was arrested for va
grancy a month ago and Judge Fritz
continued the case for thirty days to
give her opportunity to make good her
word that she yearned for decent liv
ing. So, when she was rearrested
night before last for a similar offense
and placed before the same Judge for
trial yesterday morning, she demanded
and was granted a Jury* trial, her evi
dent belief being that she could be no
more harshly dealt with by twelve
men than by the one man whose len
iency she had repaid so ungratefully.
Her bail Is $50.
"I don't know whether string beans
is part of the dinner bill of fare In the
County Jail," said his Honor, "but if
they're not you may be given some
other vegetable just as palatable."
Judge Conlan gave John Murray
four months for stealing a sack of
string beans from the doorway of a
Front street commission house that
had been closed for the night. John
pleaded ignorance that the beans be
longed to any one in particular and
said he picked up the sack because he
hated to see the sidewalk obstructed.
Besides, he was very fond of string
beans whrn * they "* were "properly
cooked.
John Tiernan and Maggie, his wife,
hadn't tasted ardent spirits for nine
months when John suggested that the
"growler" be rushed, as he felt a thirst
that water would be powerless to al
lay. Maggie adopted the suggestion
and the result was the arrest of both
for drunkenness and unseemly conduct
on Folsom street, near Seventh.
"The woman seems to have been the
tempted instead of the temptress in
this case," said the Judge, "and I have
a reversal of the usual order of things
by dismissing her and fining him $5."
Lottje Gonzales, arrested for va
grancy, hoped that Judge Fritz would
postpone his hearing of her case until
a boil on her neck could be subjected
to surgical treatment.
"For it worries me so much," Lottie
explained, "that I hardly know
whether I am standing upon my feet
or my head. Why don't you let me go
out and get it attended to?"
"Because," replied his Honor, "I'm
afraid that you might forget to return:
that the mental aberration you- alluded
to might outlast your putative physi
cal ailment. The prison doctor will
treat it for you and the treatment
won't cost you a cent. Come back
when you feel better and I'll treat you
for vagrancy."
TV. J. Stewart invited his sweetheart
to partake of refreshments with him
at a sandwich stand on Third street
and the invitation was accepted. The
lady ate a hamburger steak and Mr.
Stewart gnawed an ear of green and
succulent corn. Then the trouble be
gan. Mr. Stewart, whose cash capital
was limited to 40 cents, disputed the
caterer's bill, whereupon the lady re
marked that he was "a cheap skate"
to submit her to the humiliation of be
in? personally Involved in such an ar
gument. Angered by the chiding, Mr.
Stewart kicked. in the door of the per
ipatetic restaurant and otherwise mis
behaved himself until he was arrested.
Judge Conlan fined him ?5.
Attorney Johnnie Greeley for the de
fense, himself a "Horse and Cart" of
no mean activity, expressed his entire
satisfaction with the ruling. Then the
defendant deliberately winked at Bailiff
Mahoney and withdrew.
hummed Bailiff Mahoney as the case
was submitted for decision.
The Judge said a very delicate task
was imposed upon him by the defend
ant's declaration of her political prin
ciples and factional allegiance, as he, a
McNitb adherent, must repress a nat
ural prejudicial tendency and permit
justice alone to dictate his judgment
involving the punishment of a "Horse
Cart." Let it be recorded, there
fore, that he continued the case for
thirty days, allowing the defendant to
go free during the interim and on se
curity no more substantial than her
own recognizance. Could rinding be
more impartialâ he might say more
lenient â than that?

"BEE" BRAND CEYLON, TEA sells for 50c, 6oc, 80c and $1.00 per pound. . Â¦ 'Â¦
Read what the importers and sellers of this high-grade tea have to say of it:
"In our judgment 'Bee' brand is the best quality Ceylon tea and the best value for the money.
We have imported it for ten years. Each importation (and they come four times a year) is
larger than the previous one. Ceylon Tea is picked by hand, but thereafter it is rolled and handled
entirely by machinery. This obviates the accumulation of perspiration by delicately scented
leaves. The far-seeing Englishman finds the commercial advantage of modern methods outweigh
its cost. (Signed), GOLDBERG, BOW,EN & CO."

Yesterday two deeds and a mort
gage of this property were placed on
record. The first deed, dated July 27,
was from Mrs. Virginia Vanderbilt to
Mrs. Theresa Oelrlchs, and the second,
dated July 28, from Mrs. Oelrichs to
Thomas . Magee & Sons. The Mort
gage was from the Magees to the Hi
bernia Savings and Loan Society and
the consideration was S165.000.
Purchaser of the Lot Mortgages It to
the Hibernia Savings and
Loan Society.
Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt Jr. has
sold her property on Market street,
between Third and Fourth, to Wil
liam A. Magee. Thomas Magee Jr. and
Frederic E. Magee, the members of
the firm of Thomas Magee & Sons. Al
though the papers were recorded yes
terday the sale was made in May last,
the contract -allowing the purchasers
an unusually long time to search title
and pay the balance of the purchase
price. The property is located on the
south side of Market street, No. 769,
between Third and Fourth, arid ad-
Joins the Mackay.property on the east.
With 25 feet front on Market street.
175 feet to Stevenson street and 135
feet front on Stevenson street, the lot
is therefore â-shaped, with its larg
est frontage on Stevenson street. It
contains 11,950 square feet. The Im
provements consist of a three-story
frame building occupied by various
tenants under a lease which has three
years to run, so that no improvements
can be erected until the expiration of
the lease. The price at which the
property changed hands is noC made
public. :
The contract of sale was signed in
May of this year and previous to the
agreement* between Mrs. Vanderbilt
and Thomas Magee & Sons for the
sale of the remainder of her proper
ties. Some of these have already been
sold and other sales are under nego
tiation.

Hay and Feedstuff s.
The demoralisation In Hay continues, and
the quotations are very weak. It will take
some time to get rid of the great accumulation
In the railroad yards. Roiled Barley is ad
vancing with the raw prain. but otherwise
there is no change ia Feedstuff*.
The circular cf Somers it Co. say 3 cf Hay:
'"For the week ending to-day 5*(X> tens of
Hay have been shipped to the San Francisco
market, which as far as we know is the
heaviest amount on record for one week.
Lack of track room alone has prevented f,ur
' ther shipments, and It is reported that at
present there are ever ICO cars cf hay on the
Oakland tracks awaiting shlprasnt here. It
can be readily understood that with â¢ rurh
heavy arrivals, the market has beÂ«n -utry
weak and prices are therefore materially
lower. As we have reported before, the de
mand seems somewhat limited this season, for.
although there Is some Hay moving coastwis*
right along, yet city consumption seems to
have materially decreased. Should there be
a revival of trade with the large wholesale
houses here a bit later, we may see an in
creased demand for Hay. but from the pres
ent outlook, with only, about one-half X grain
crop ior the entire State, business prospects
are not especially promising. ; '.
"The railroad company will probably be
taxed to the utmost during the next month to
supply cars for Hay. Shipment* began liter
than usual, and there Is still a very large
amount oat of doors for which there Is no
warehouse rooia. We fear, therefore, that we
may have a very much depressed market here
later ia the month, cr after the 1st of Sep
tember.
"Choice Wheat Hay seems ta held Its own
fairly well, but the medium, and poorer gradoa
are lower."

troa and rtÂ»<?l traie situation mas anctt*r
legitimate ground for arprebension ovÂ»r val

tt* demand than to bn-g any s#venÂ« preaaan
to bear en th<Â» market. Tt^re was no general
Iit;u;lat!rm in evidence, and the bear* were
t - -. about attacking the market by short
Â«.i - - jiTE^attaiic . effect. of special TrÂ«ai
nÂ»*s at one cr two pcicts was also wÂ»U re

sf the speculative fcoM'rs t*cau*e of the con
tinued failure of co=2rmaUoa of the merger
raraors, which induced . them to buy their
itccks. Sugar gav<Â» e-. idrnce of a culmination
of a speculatica and of liquidation br belated
tellers. The feehng in professional specula
tive circl-es was in favor cf scrne reaction en
technical ground*, but ttill tfc* yielding en
th% p?E*ral list was very moderate. The de
cUr-e cf 1*Â» ia Canadian Pacific ca account of
lew temperature* fcr the wheat crop ia Mani
toba was aa Â«xtreme movement. Â¦ The lowest
price fcr United States tteel preferred on the
break ia the price scteduie for ftnishÂ«d prod
ucts was cv.'.y 4 b*!aw last night. Tius was
before thÂ« cfScial adtnissicn cf the cut in the
price Of wire. AÂ» this is the event which the
felling for seme time waÂ» meant to participate,
it was natural that there ehculd t* some cov
ering fcy rp*Â«u;ative shorts on the asnocace
rnert. The recovery which resulled in United
Slates Stt<el rrererred went far toward , rea*
ruring tbe distuxÂ«Ki Â«ntiment in th< financial
district. An effective rally followed and the
rt-straici was removed from the special ! fea
tures of etreagrh which made etrlkir^ gair.Â».
The corn ar.i ccttca carriers enjoyed a firm
ttndertoc* thrcughoct. The firmness of the
com markrt tras attribute<l*to sympathy with
the violent adiin^e in wheat. >aud reports cur

th* hard and mitt coal group, made Â¦ substan

especially in the movement cf eoft coal to the

Mehrtens, William J. Hogan, Joseph ;
P. Hayes, John J. . Driscoll, David P. j
Torres and George J. Heggerty.
Here a motion to adjourn found j
many seconds and'the first day of the
convention was at an end. McNab was
left in control of the works, and when i
the convention is again called he will !
name the judicial ticket and a large j
portion of the legislative end, the
Horses and Carts seemingly beinsr too
despondent to ask for even those things
a less dejected minority often lays
claim to. |
Then Judge Davis asked Flint what
disposition had been made of the ex
amination papers. "I understand
that they were all destroyed, except
two of Miss Fischer's, which Professor
Calvert kept as curiosities," replied
Flint.
"Did not you write to the Governor
on June 2. after Miss Fischer's charges
were made public, saying that the pa
pers had been preserved and would
prove that no favoritism was shown?"
asked Mr. Davis.
Flint admitted that he had written
to that effeet.
He also admitted having seen one
of George Harvey's examination pa
pers before the rating was made on
It. Hearsay testimony in regard to
what State University students had
said and thought about the pharmacy
board was then heard.
The hearing will be resumed at 10
to-day- S39
Miss Alice M. de Sponda, whom Miss
Fischer accuses of saying that she had
received advance notice as to the char
acter of the examinations, denied the
allegation. Clarence Balah. another
successful graduate, said Miss Fischer
had told him of the remark, supposed
to have been made by Miss de Sponda,
but got mixed in his dates under cross
examination.
At the evening session Professor
John Henry Flint of the College of
Physicians and Surgeons spent a few
uncomfortable hours under a fire of
questions from the investigating
commission. He admitted that he
took a deep interest in nine of his pu
pils who were taking the examina
tions He said he had gathered them !
in the dispensary In the hospital every j
day before the examinations. There i
he quizzed them regarding subjects
that were likely to be asked. He de
nied ever having seen a list of the
questions to be given.
Regarding the $5 bet Flint admit
ted that he had wagered that amount
with Professor Moloney that George
C. Harvey, one of his pupils, would
receive the highest percentage. All of
his pupils, he said, passed the exam- I

if he failed to pass, but replied In the
negative.
Cloraine Fitzgerald, who is alleged to
have been flitting through the exam

When asked if she had the questions,
she retorted that if she had she would

"Then I appeal from the ruling of the

"I move that j the .-appeal .be laid on
the table," shouted- a delegate in the
rear of the 1 hall, and this move was sec
onded. A vote was called for, but
O'Donnell avoided defeat for the'Horses
and "Carts by withdrawing' his < appeal.
This ended what, threatened to develop
into an interesting row. The chair then
ordered that the count proceed. ',
The Twenty-eighth came in solid with
nine votes for Heggerty. In the twen
ty-ninth there was a . split, the vote
standing nine for Sims and three for
Heggerty, Frank Shannon, James
Creighton and Robert Gough bolting
the McNab ticket in favor â of, the
league. . In the Thirtieth there was an
other break from McNab's forces, Fred
P. Bender skipping the traces, making
the vote of that district twelve for Sims
and one for Heggerty. The thirty-first
cast twelve votes for Sims, the Thirty
second eleven votes for Sims and the
Thirty-third eight for Sims. In' the
Thirty-fourth .there came another
break to the Horses and Carts. William
Reedy, who cast one vote, and William
J. Siebert, accredited with one-half* a
vote, voted for â¢ Heggerty, making the

McCarthy rose from his seat among
the delegates of the Thirty-fifth and
protested that his name had not been
called at the opening of the conven

Chairman Hickey Informed him that
the roll from which the call had been
made was the temporary roll which
had been certified to the County Com
mittee by the Registrar, and though
the Registrar had certified another roll
to the committee at 5 o'clock.
PROMISES TO BE FAIR.
William F. Humphrey of the Thirty
eighth District rose to second the nom
ination of Mr. Heggerty. Shouts from
the gallery of "platform" had their
effect and Mr. Humphrey ascended to
the chairman's table, where he
delivered a seconding speech Â¦ warmly
eulogistic of Mr. Heggerty. Seconds
then followed In rapid succession. The
Twenty-eighth Assembly District again
seconded Heggerty's nomination; the
Twenty-ninth, Sims'; the Thirtieth,
Sims'; the Thirty-first, Sims'; the Thir

Nominations were then closed upon
motion and the call for a vote was
made. Chairman Hickey, after, an
nouncing that it would take 85 votes
to elect either nominee, appointed
Messrs. Duncan, Welch, Mullen and
Dillon to act aa tellers. Mr. Mullen
gave way to Horace Ford of the Thir

Upon motion the ' chair was em
powered to appoint a committee of five
to settle all contests for seats, to:ap
point a committee of five on platform
and resolutions and to name a com
mittee of eighteen on permanent or
ganization and order of business. . A
motion to adjourn was then made, but
before it could be put Central Commit
tee .Chairman Hickey moved , that the
temporary officers be made permanent.
The motion carried with but little op
position from the Horses and Carts,
their "noes" being weak and scattered.
The chair then announced that the
only contests that appeared of record
were one filed by Henry Eickhoff of the
At* the conclusion -of. Senator Sims'
address W. H. McCarthy of the Thirty
fifth was elected secretary of the con
vention.y Mr. McCarthy made a brief
address, thanking the convention for
its action, and assumed the duties of
his office, j
This convention must nominate Judicial and
legislative tickets. Upon . -looking into the
faces of the men that constitute this conven
tion I see assurance that the men who will be
nominated for Judicial positions are men
whose purity, and honesty cannot be ques
tioned, and no matter how many millions are
involved in <â¢ lltlcetion before them they will
leave no stain upon the ermine. Our constitu
ents,'I can"a'ssert, need not fear that the men
that will be selected for legislative offices will
d* other than reflect credit and honor upon
them and. the State arid It rests with us to see
that their trust is not betrayed.
Thanking you again for the generous honor
you have bestowed upon me, and assuring the
gentleman whose motion made my election
unanimous of my fullest appreciation and
deepest gratitude, I repeat that fairness is the
keynote of the policy I will pursue during the
deliberations of this convention.
no stain* for: ermine.
For a minute several men that had
been keeping tally figured in silence,
and then the shout from the McNab
forces made it plain that the Horses
and Carts had passed from their im
agined -power and that McNab had
won. In a moment the vote was an
nounced by the chairâ 90 J /2 for Sims and
76% for Heggerty. O'Donnell imme
diately rose and moved that the vote be
made unanimous. His motion carried
with a whoop.
Messrs. O'Donnell, Kelly and Heg
gerty were then appointed to escort
Senator Sims to the chair. As they
Reached the platform three cheers pro
posed for Sims were given with a will,
and three just as lusty followed for
Heggerty. Introducing Mr. Sims to
the convention and expressing his
pleasure at being enabled to surrender
the gavel, or rather the claw hammer,
Mr. Hickey withdrew into the lines of
his delegationâ that of ' the Thirtieth.
After shaking, hands with those that
escorted him to the chair, Senator Sims
turned to the gathering and said:
It is a matter o'f rccret to me that in any
way my name should come into collision with
that- of my accomplished friend Charles J.
Heirnrmy. but. I. must acquiesce in the wlli
of .the majority, which is In Itself a good
Democratic oollcy. I deem it a Kreat honor
that I should have been elected to preside
over this convention, but let me assure you
that so long jvs Democratic principles exist in
my heartâ and that will be to the endâ my
only thouKht will be to serve you with im
partiality and fairness and In a manner that
will meet with â¢ the amirohtuion of all.
The Supreme Court has Just declared valid
a bond Issue of 517,000,000. which Â»Koes to
show the good Judcment ' of the Democratic
Board of Suoervlsors that framed the meas
ure, and we are facing a campaign in which
w>j will have sreat opiyirtunlty to add to our
prestige as a party, j It lies with us to im
prove the streets and under the policy of ex
pansion we advocate every school child shall
be given a roof over Its head and a desk at
which to sit and study.
The Thirty-fifth cast its solid vote of
nine delegates for Sims, but when the
Thirty-sixth was reached matters be
gan to brighten for the Horses and
Carts. This district cast ten solid for
Heggerty, the Thirty-seventh followed
with ten more for Heggerty and the
Thirty-eighth plumped ten more for
Heggerty, and this started some cheer-
Ing. A bang from the gong let the
Thirty-ninth In with its votes, and here
came an interesting split. Six of the
delegates voted for Sims, but Thomas
Judge, James P. Quigley and D. 'Cur
ran, who were accredited with one
fourth of a vote each, hurled their
strength into the Heggerty column.
Livingston Jenks, who climbed astride
the fence when he saw how things were
going, modestly refrained from upset
ting any calculations and refused to
cast the one-fourth vote that rested in
his hands. It Is said that this uncast
one-fourth vote was the only asset the
Horses and Carts had left when the
convention adjourned.
The Fortieth District came In with
six votes solid for Sims, the Forty-first
gave seven for Heggerty and the For
ty-second added ten more to the Heg
gerty column. The forty-third added
eight votes to Heggerty's now defeated
forces, but the Forty-fourth came in
strong with nine votes for Sims. The

The howls of delight that greeted the
announcement of Senator Sims' name
had no sooner quieted than J. E.
O'Donnell of the Thirty-seventh mount
ed the platform to place in nomination
Charles J. Heggerty of the Forty-first,
the hope of the Democratic League. In
the midst of cheers O'Donnell opened
his oration. He said:
The name he possesses is a sufficient suar
antue for all that I have e&td. Under his
guidance this convention will- round out Its
work in a manner that will be above reproach
and that will vrln the fullest Indorsement of
the people of our city. For chairman of this
convention I- place in nomination the Hon.
James C. Sims of the Forty -fourth Assembly
District. . '.Â¦Â¦Â¦,
Kelly was greeted with cheers, which
a ran from the anvil quieted. Kelly
then said:
As announced, we are about to select Â¦ a
chairman for thin convention. "We are about to
confer a j high truf t and place in the hands
of one man the office of leader of this con
vention. ThJe honor, I believe, we should
place in the hands of one who possesses In
the highest dopree a senne of equity and Jus
tice ar.d who Is girt found with ser\-lce to
the r>arty. The man whose name I am about
to place before you is sufficiently well known
and distinguished to eliminate all question as
to his fitness for the office. Ke possesses a
clear head, a high sen.Â«e of equity -and a strong
will. lie will treat alf with fairness If be Is
called to rule.
Still there was no protest from the
Horses and Carts, otherwise the Demo
cratic League, and William A. Kelly of
the Thirty-fifth Assembly District
mounted tne platform to place ex-Sen
ator James C. Sims of the Forty-fourth,
the McNab candidate for chairman, in
nomination.
GREETED WITH CHEERS.
"There are 157 delegates - present."
said Chairman Hickey when the call
was concluded. "This number consti
tutes a quorum, and we will take up
the first 'question before this conven
tion â the' election of a temporary chair
man."
WIELDS CLAW HAMMER.
Chairman HIckey rapped for order at
8:16 o'clock â and such a rap. His gavel
was an overweight claw hammer, and
the face of the table held a large and
ragged piece of some abandoned steam
boiler. The effect of the first blow was
ghastly. The .clang split the ears of the
expectant Bourbons and cleaned the
right out of their systems as if they had
been shot. Chairman Hlckey's order
that all take their seats as assigned
was meekly obeyed, all seeming to be
anxious to avoid further bombardment
from the claw hammer and gong.
"Call the roll," said Chairman Hickey,
addressing the secretary. A moment
of suspense follcv/ed this order, as it
had been announced that on this point
the opposing forces would open Uie bat
tle. But the Horses and Carts, sat si
lent and the secretary proceeded.
Gavin McNab organized the Demo
cratic local convention at the Alham
bra Theater last evening. Former Sen
ator J. C. Sims, the candidate of the or
ganization, received 9(Hi votes for
chairman and was subsequently elected
by acclamation. His opponent, Charles
J. Heggerty, as the representative of
the Horse and Cart faction, obtained
76& votes. Mr. Heggerty would have
made a record of an even 77 votes If
Livingston Jenks had thrown his one
fourth of y a whole vote to the hard
pressed column of the defeated but
dauntless James H. O'Brien, but Dele
gate Jenks at the critical moment de
clined to lend his support to either fac
tion of the party.
There was no fighting to excite the
multitude of spectators. There was no
uproar or tumult to inspire the Demo
cratic legions with hopes of victory.
The entire proceeding was monoton
nusly peaceful. A detachment of police
strong enough to quell a riot was at the
disposal of Thomas W. HIckey, chair
man of the Democratic City and Coun
ty Committee, but the arm of the law
was not needed to preserve order. Men
who had traveled many miles to see an
old-time Democratic rough-house, went
home disappointed and dejected. The
opposition to McNab had Just a look in,
and is out of business again. The carts
are parked and the horses have gone
to pasture. At a signal from Gavin
McXab the delegates will assemble
again, and whoever may be' slated by
McNab for nomination will be a nomi
nee of the convention. Gavin McNab
was present last night and remarked at
the finish that the Horses and Carts
did not leave a loophole to save them
selves.

Montague &. Co.
He is said to have talked of suicide
Â¦even] times to J. vr^stphalen of S4S
KolFom street, at whose house Clas
sen's wife was laid up with a broken
Jeg. Deputy Coroner Brown learned
that Classen ha*! been treated for the
liquor habit and often went on a rpree.
He is paid to have been a heavy drink
er and had numerous squabbles with
his wife. Despondency du*Â» to alcohol

R." P. Evans, who worked alongside
of Clfissen In tha forenoon, said that
Classen appeared to be somewhat ner
vous and cut his finger, but he did not
observe anything else unusual about
him.
George W. Classen's dead body was
found yesterday afternoon lying In a
pool of blood in Francis M. Smith &
Oo.'s boiler works, at the corner of
Eighth and Townsend streets. There
were two bullet wounds in the head,
one where the missile had entered and
the other where it had passed out.
Near the body was found a Colt's .38
caliber revolver. One of the chambers
had been' discharged. In the pockets
of the dead man were found the case
lor a bank book of the German Sav
ings and Loan Society, but the book
itself was missing; coin amounting to
526; cards of membership in the Boiler
makers' Union and the Order of Her
mann Sons; thirteen cartridges to
the revolver and some correspondence
with Curtin & Co. with reference to
the collection by them from a man
named Dannebaum of certain monthly
payments due from Dannebaum to
Classen, averaging J5 per month. A
late note from Curtin stated that
Dannebaum was unable to make his
regular payment, but would make a
double payment on the month follow
ing.
Deputy Coroner Michael Brown and
Special Deputy David Ahern made an
Investigation of the case and reported
that Classen had killed himself. The
police detective detailed on the matter
made a similar report-
From Otto Dauscher, the foreman. It
was learned that Classen left the
works for lunch at 11:45 a. m. and re
turned at 1:SD p. m. in his street clothes,
friÂ« working clothes having been left
In his room at 452 Naioma street Al
though It. was evident that Classen had
cot returned with the intention of re
nmlng work, the foreman said noth
ing to him nor he to the foreman. A
quarter or a half hour later Classen's
dead body was found. Owing to the
constant noise of hammering in the
place, the report of the pistol was not
heard.
Miss Rubv Devoto Fischer, the prin
cipal witness against the board, was j
again called to the stand hv the com- ;
mission yesterday morning. Miss ,
Fischer reiterated her charge that Pro- j
fessor Flint had aided candidates of
the College of Physicians and Sur
geons, and quoted Miss Grace Eddy
as authority for the statement that j
Professor Flint had signaled with two
fingers to one Mr. Harvey when a
.question was propounded as to how
many fluids were in a certain - drug,
the answer to the question being two. :
Continuing Miss Fischer said that It
she remembered correctly, a Miss Nel- ;
son also saw Professor Flint signal to
Harvey, .and that she (the witness)
had heard that Professor Flint had bet j
one of the members of the board $5
that Harvey would stand highest on j
the roll after the rating had been com
pleted. Miss Fischer said that while
all this was going on the members of
the board, other than Dr. J. J. Crow
ley, were present. Dr. Crowlev was
not in the city.
As to the time allowed them Miss 'Â¦
Fischer said that before she had fin- â¢
ished her paper on "Identification of ',
Drugs" she was told that her time was
up, and that she must quit. Charles ;
Rowley, president of the board, told j
her to quit. She had heard that others
had been treated in the same manner,
Grace Eddy especially making com- |
plaint.
The witness had also heard that cer- j
tain of the favored candidates had j
been given the questions in advance, j
one regarding the difference between j
fusions and decoctions being especially j
recollected by her. Miss Desponds had !
told her this. Regarding an alleged !
interview, in whicfh Miss Fischer had j
been quoted as making, among other i
statements, one to the effect that she |
had heard that certain members of !
the board were entertaining at dinners i
and theater parties various pretty girls
of the college, the witness made a de
tailed explanation. She denied por- j
tlons of the interview and admitted !
others, reiterating the statement that ;
rumors of gay times often floated 'Â¦
through the college.
Here Mr. Rowley made an explana
tion of. the manner in which the exam- j
lnations were conducted, the class of!
April being so large that it was neces- j
sary to divide it. a portion going up- |
stairs and others remaining downstairs.
In answer to the question as to wheth- :
er those that had taken the examina- ;
tlon were permitted or could in any '
way communicate with those that were !
waiting to , take the same, Mr. Rowley
said that provisions were such that no
opportunity was given the candidates j
to communicate with one another In i
any way. It developed, however, that |
Miss Fischer herself was discovered on j
the skylight of the building taking ob- |
servations of the proceedings below. ;
What advantage this daring co-ed
gained no one was able to answer, but '
it was suggested. that she might have;
dropped messages to friends seated in
the amphitheater. â¢
Regarding Miss Fitzgerald's presence |
during the January examination; Mr.
Calvert had a few things to say. He
said she sat far back chatting with !
some young men, and that she made no I
effort to aid any of the candidates. He !
knew this because he watched her very â¢
closely. He made no explanation as to :
why 'he did not request her to depart i
in view of his admission that he found it
necessary "to watch her very closely."
AFTERNOOX SESSION*.
The afternoon session opened with
Miss Fischer again in the witness chair,
her cross-examination by members of
the board continuing.
Professor Rowley began a rambling
cross-examination of the young wom
an, which brought out little of Import- i
ance. "When Miss Fischer reiterated |
that she learned by peering through '
the transom that the applicants In the â¢
lower room received more time for the \
examination, Rowley asked her if she j
judged tjme by eyesight. She was |
asked If she heard of the remark of t
Brandon A. "Weever to do up the board
