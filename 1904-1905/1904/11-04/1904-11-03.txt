OMAHA, Nov. 2.â Bitten by a green
snake when a boy. Arthur Wells, now
25 years of age, has developed a strong
aversion to anything and everything of
that color. To-day he. was taken to the
police station violently delirious, the re
sult of being shown to a room In a hotel
which was hung with green paper.
Wells' case is a puzzler. For thirty
y<?a\V he has had a superstitious
dreaJi of green neckties, green clothing
and especially green wallpaper. Green
leaves and green tres â¢ only affect him
to a slight degree. His relatives say
that his aversion to the color Is the re
sult of the bite of a. sniair green snake
when he was young. An attack of ty
phoid fever which he had several years
ago he attributed to sleeping In a room
that was hung with green wallpaper.
In his delirium he believes his friends
are trying to poison him by feeding him
on green paper. He shrieks for help and
begs piteously. for those about him to
dislodge the green paper, which he im
agines has been stuffed into his nostrils,
his mouth and his eyes.

' 3Iarr^d br Accidents.
ST.- LOinS. Nov. 2.â Two accidents
to-day prevented the long-distance
trial flight arranged by Captain Thom
es S. Baldwin of San Francisco to test
thÂ» staying powers of his airship, the
California Arrow, and what was to
have been a speed demonstration
around a prescribed quadrangular
course of about, fifteen miles developed
Info a drifting exhibition- The Ar
row ftnallv landed in a cornfield four
rnlles;west of the aeronautic concourse
at the World's Fair, after the motor
had been disabled by an exha^ist cap
aj?ain blowing off when the vessel had
rfmuined its fight after the first break
down had been repaired.
Th- first accident resulted in the
Arrow being brought to the ground
about a mile and a half northwest of
the concourse. The airship was com
manded by a. â¢ Roy Knabenshue of
Tcl*do. the hero of the successful
f.ights of Monday and yesterday. Cap
tain Baldwin had arranged to follow
the airship in an automobile, and
"Â»-ijÂ«n the accident occurred and the
motor stopped he gave instructions
to follow the drifting aerial craft.
Â«.I u , s i. b l. fore P*Â«ing through the
V>c>lds Fair gat*Â».s a Jefferson Guard
ran to th- automobile and handed
Captain Baldwin a metal cap which.
he said, had fallen just after' it was
noticed that the airship was in troubl-
The captain explained the nature o'f
the accident to those on the ground
and s*id that the damage could be re
paired without bringing the airship
back to the aerodrome, providing
Knabenshue could land without usins
too much gas, and the trip b*> re
somed after the Arrow returned to the
concourse under its own power.
When Captain Baldwin reached the
Arrow the repairs were immediately
started and in less than an hour the
Arrow was again in the air. making

WASHINGTON. Nov. 2.â President
Roosevelt had an J escape from death
so narrow, that It was almost miracu

while, he ; was riding through the coun

Sunday afternoon. ., The j accident'. did
not become ; known .until '. torday. ",'.". The
President ..was approaching <a ; ' high

stumbled and fell, throwing Roosevelt
off forward. -He struck squarely, on his

standing; near 'him.-- â¢ - â¢>Â«:
By that time there was. 'a great
lump on the right side of the.Presi

from a long but shallow scalp wound
above the right ear, " where his head
had ; struck aÂ» stone a glandng blow.
The cut extended down .the forehead
and evidences of It still are there. ,.

that, his -neck was not broken* by the
force of his . fall. - If he had â¢ landed â¢ on
thejStone. which scratched his ; head in
stead of in the soft earth beside it- he
believes his - skull would have been
crushed: like" an: egg' shell. 'The Presi

paid about his accident. He was at his

WASHINGTON. Nov. 2.â The State Department received a cablegram
from the American embassy at St. Petersburg which warrants It in the as
sumption that the Russian Government will soon agree to recognize pass
ports, of American Jews traveling in Russia.
Harsh and oppressive discriminations against American Hebrews who
have visited Russia, or who have sought to, have furnished the basis for a
vast amount of diplomatic correspondence between Russia and the j United
States during: the past twenty years. Up to the present time the United
States has been unable to secure any alleviation of the rigorous measures to
which American Hebrew citizens were subjected when they desired to visit
the dominions of the Czar!

Of the number twenty are students.
Most of the injuries consist of scalp
wounds and body bruises. -Four stu

Many others, whose wounds were

The ' trouble occurred on. the steps
of Rogers Hall, one of the Technology
buildings, on Boyleston street, where
the students -had gathered, following
the parade of the Republican clubs of
Harvard University and the Institute

steps ; of the building and- when the
college men made a rush up the steps
they were met by the officers with
drawn clubs and a fierce^flght ensued.
The officers used their clubs freely
and soon many of the college men
were bleeding from wounds on Â¦ the
face and head.' Hundreds of students
hurried to the support -of their fel

CODY, Wyo., Nov. 2.â Several bat
tles have been fought between the
posse and the outlaws who attempted
to rob the First National Bank of
Cody yesterday afternoon and who
murdered the cashier. The bandits are
still at large, although their capture
or death Is but a matter of ayfew
hours. ;>*â¢:
At dawn to-day the officers came
upon the bandits in camp on tha Gray
Bull, River^ sixty-five miles from the
scene of last evening's battle. The
robbers refused to surrender and put
up a hard fight. The horse of one of
the officers was killed and some of the
men had narrow escapes. The robbers
succeeded in. getting away. The posse
followed slowly.
The outlaws were again overtaken
on Enos Creek, thirty miles from
Meeteetee and eighty miles Jrom Cody,
and another fight occurred.. One of
the bandits was wounded in the thigh,
but his companions hoisted him into
his saddle and after a running fight
for Â¦ four miles the outlaws again , got
away. *
A courier came in to-night* with the
news that. the murderers had been sur
rounded : in a forest on Cottonwood
Creek and that their capture is likely
to occur at any time. The outlaws had
been called upon to surrender, . but re
fused to come forth."
The timber will be closely, guarded
during the night. and the outlaws, will
probably be taken or killed by morn
ing.; If captured they will be. taken to
Cody and a lynching may result.
Colonel Cody arrived at Cody this
evening with his Indian trailers, scouts
and cowboys, â¢ accompanied by a < party
of English noblemen and New York

The Board of Election Commission
ers met last night One ef the first
matters brought up was the high
liquor license petition presented by the
Civic Council and to the criticl&ro; made

by the clergy of this city. It was de
cided to send the following communi
cation to ; the Reverends A- C. Bane,
John A. B. Wilson and thÂ« ministry
of this city. Following is a copy of
the communication, which was signed
Â¦by all the members of the board:
Reverend Sirsâ It having come to the Â«Â»<Ht c Â«
of 'the Board of Election Commissioners that
several ministers of the gospel to San Fran
cisco â¢ have recently given utterance to de
nunciations calculated, to bring odium- upon
this department, and discredit upon- the pres
ent administration, a. protest U herewith re
spectfully directed to the local clergy -in its
The members' of the Board of Election Com
missioners, bitterly assailed as they have bev-n
by men of- your bory calling, are reluctant
Indeed to btlleve tfcat any minister of " the
gospel would knowingly, lend .himself to the
furtherance* of any plan conceived by dis
gruntled politicians to 'wreak vengeance upon
public fcervants who are honestly striving to
do their full duty. It is" equally difficult for
the Board of Election Commissioners to con
ceive at *ny churchman, honored and respected
as the leader of a flock and an expounder of
the truth, permitting- a hypocritical press to
strike at innocent dtlxens through the agency
of' the pulpit. With these strong convections
uppermost in their minds, the members of the
Board of Election- Commissioners herewith pre
sent themselves for your most solemn consid
eration as citisens who deserve to have their
statements heard before they- are wrongly
Judged, severely scored by the ministry and
published from the pulpit as being unworthy
of publJc confidence. ' â¢ . â¢ '
The most diligent inquiry on- the part of
the Election Commissioners falls, to disclose
that' those gentlemen of the cloth who are
publicly denouncing this. department 1 .i*ave felt
it Incumbent upon them to- make the -slightest
personal Investigation of actual conditions and
facts - before proclaiming to their congrega
tions that the Board of Election Commission-,
ers is an unworthy body. It Is therefore
deemed fitting that this remonstrance should
be prefaced with the declaration that the
Boaid of Election Commissioners has not
knowingly committed any -breach o* the law
whatsoever, -and is entirely Innocfcnt of the
copious political charges that have been
launched through the church in this. city. :
FAVOR HIGH LICENSE.
In the matter of the high liquor license
petition. â¢ every member of the Board of Elec
tion .Commissioners happens to personally
favor a license higher ' than that now exist'
Ing. one Commissioner even advocating a'
higher figure than that recently suggested by
petition.. This liquor license petition was
decided strictly upon its merits. Its contents
were carefully canvassed and counter checked
.by a -corps of sworn and capable deputies, at
'least one of whortl uui "lathered a portion of
the petition In question. The Board of Election
Commissioners is happy to state that' it re
poaes. the- highest confidence in the Integrity
and ability -of Its secretary, the Registrar of
Voters, and In every Â¦ clerk attached to this,
department, and the Intimation given out that
a single name, or any number of names In tha
high Jicense petition received : anything .- but
the fairest and most honest consideration -li
unwarranted- and .visits a most serious ln-
Juirtlce upon Innocent men.
For categorical- Information this commission,
respectfully represents : â¢ Â¦ â¢ , -
(1) That the. original petition has not been
deotroyed as charged, but is yet on official file.
(2) That no person has ever been denied ac
cess to It, at a reasonable time, nor has any
person or element been favored in Its â¢Inspection.
(3) That the course' of verification .of signa
tures In the case of this petition; . was not an
unusual or exceptional proceeding, but a duty
enjoined on the Election Commissioners, and
had been pursued in the case of every peti
tion ever submitted' to this board.- whether
for the submission of ordinances or for ; the
nomination of candidates.
. ' (1) Not a single name of the many obviously
forged signatures, nor a single on* of those
claimed to be forged were subtracted from the
total number of names signed In ascertaining
the number of valid signatures of qualified
voters. " N ..â¢-Â¦Â¦-. ' â¢ : ;
(3} Not a single name of the hundreds or
thousands petitioning for a withdrawal of th'etr
signatures from the high license petition . was
considered or deducted. Â¦ >i aKa!3*****rW!fc)tl
(6) The .only deductions mad* were those
of signers who were found to be not regis
tered, or. who could not be locates.- â¢ In ac
cordance with the usual custom three deputies
examined and checked each signature, Â«o that
the possibility of a mistake might be reduced
to a minimum. : Owing to the illegibility of
some of the "signatures'" occasional mistakes
may have occurred, but they -art very tew and
very far betw*een,^as a reinspectlcn of the pe
tition by the board and others -has disclosed. '
NOT, ENOUGH NAMES.
The Â¦ petition Â¦ on ' verification was : . found to

"headway against . the breeze that had
blown it ' out of : its . course. ' and it
looked as though the long-distance
test would be made.
- Just before* the Arrow arrived at a
position over the concourse the motor
was seen to hesitate. Three or four
wavering revolutions followed and
then the silver-colored blades hung
motionless, .while the airship was
again grasped by the breeze and hur
ried back over the distance it had iron
in its duel with the wind. , ..
Knabenshue, undaunted by the sec*
ond break-down, hung far out over
the side of the aerial vessel and waved
his cap toward the hundreds of
persons thronging the aeronautic con
course. Â¦ s . -.'Â¦Â¦-â¢
Higher and higher floated the air
ship, tha, breeze, which was blowing
at the rate of about five miles an
hour from the southeast, eagerly tak
ing hold of the helpless craft and
wafting it slowly -away from the sight
of those anxiously following its course,
1500 or 2000 feet below.
The atmosphere had been very heavy
all the afternoon, and it did not take
long before the California Arrow was
a tiny cigar-shaped object, almost ob
scured from view. As long as it could
be discerned, however, the crowd
watched its every movement, and sev
eral hundred persona remained at
the concourse until word had been re
ceived from Knabenshue that he had
alighted safely and that neither he
nor the Arrow had been injured be
yond the minor accident to the ma
chinery of the latter.
As the vessel -was near the con
course Captain Baldwin decided that
it would entail too great a loss of
time to deflate the bag and carry the
Arrow back to the World's Fair
grounds. Volunteers -were numerous
and Baldwin's plan of carrying the
Arrow back to the concourse by hand
was agreed to, and. with relays pf
bearers, the march was begun.
Knabenshue said to-night that he
had remained in. the air, although
drifting, as he could see the automo
bile following far behind.
"The only; trouble,'' he. said, "was
that the exhaust cap blew off. I lost
the cap twice and each time the mo
tor stopped dead and I was at the
mercy of the wind, which, fortunately,
was not very brisk." .

.This is. the. text of the jury's* verdict
a: the Coroner's inquest on the fisher

edy. At the request of the British
.Government,. -represented by the Earl
of Dysart, .Secretary of the Treasury,
this, award v.as rendered by the llrst
court of" inquiry preceding the ses
sions of the international tribunal.
The Government asked the Jury not
to nnd.$i -verdict of willful murder or
manslaughter- because "d.elicate nego
tiations are going on which should not
be made niure difficult and it is not
desired .to let any one know they had
).' re- ju diced the etise before having
hear<j both sides."
COIKT ADDS A WOKD
' In consequence the jury set forth
the facts' proved by ' the evidence of
physician's, experts on explosives a.nd
the tratvJerg themselves. To the-ver
d.ict the Judge added the following

British empire, the -jury would record
their appreciation of the efforts made
"by the Governments interested to ar-
rive at a satisfactory conclusion of the
matter, which, we fear, has no par
allel fii the history of the world."
Sf. George's Hall, a large auditorium,
Â¦which has, been especially fitted" up for
the- occasion, was quite inadequate to
ti'?ommodate the crowd that wished to
J:Ftfn to. ihe evidence. The interest wan
ii.ttnse Â£i d ther* was some excitement,

THOUGHT IT A SHAH FIGHT.
The proceedings occupied only about
three hours. The testimony consisted
of. medical evidence^ by which it was
proved that the death of Smith a^d
Leggett was the result of shell and. ma~
chine gun wounds; then an expert iden
tified fragments of. shells ' by private
marks, which he said were undoubt
edly Russian, and - the captains and
mate* of the trawlers told their stories.
These latter related that, while they
were engaged in their regular work the
Â£hips of. the Baltic fleet, in two squad
rons, emerged suddenly from the haze
and throwing the glare of their search
lights on the Gamecock â¢ fleet without
warning and disregarding flare green
lights, the fishermen's signals, and
though then .within actual speaking
distance of one vessel commenced a
cannonade, which the fishermen at first,
not realizing the danger, enjoyed;
thinking it was a sham flght. The fir
ing lasted a half-hour. .
SAW- NO TORPEDO-BOATS.
To each of these witnesses was put
the vitaT .question regarding tb.e pres
ence of a foreign .vessel or torpedo
boat. Each with equal pdsltiveness de
clared that at neither time, preceding
cr' following the .firing, was any Japa
nese or -any foreign vessel seen4>y them
cr the accompanying fishing fleet, j It
was also stated that there were no
Japanese among the crews and that
none of the trawlers carried a-rma of
any kind. One of the skippers, replying
to a question by the Coroner, said that
curing the five weeks he was in the
North Sea he had" not seen .any war
ships until that night. .
ThKteiosed the evidence. Counsel for.

the treasury then made the suggestion
with regard to the nature of the ver
dict, with which the Coroner agreed,
and without delay it was so returned,*
with an added expression of sympathy
for the relatives and friends of the dead
and injured and of appreciation of the
"calm and courageous manner in which
the fishing fleet remained at its duties
after the terrible experience." Â¦

the human system for' the same clea"ns-
hig purpose. â¢ .
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it ia not a
drug at all, but simply, absorbs the.
rases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and. carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking" or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the

eminently safe cathartic
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it

form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
i>Â« in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges;. they
are composed of the finest powdered
v.illow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather In
the form of large, pleajsant tasting
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with honey. '
The daUy use" of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter â¢ breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but on the contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician. In speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients* suffering from gas In stomach
and bowels, and to clear the com-
plexion and purify the breath,- mouth
nnd throat; I also believe the liver is
greatly benefited by the dally use of
th*m; they cost but twenty-five cents
n box at drug stores, and, although
Ir. nome tense a patent preparation, yet
J believe I get more and better char-

The application to Judge Charles
Halsey for permission to adopt Charles
D. Dewey, aged three years and nine
months, was made by George and
Johanna M. Monnier on April 14. 1882.
It was stated that the child had been
in .the care of the petitioners and that
the consent of his mother. Mary E.
Darling, had been given for the adop
tion. It was also sta.ed that the boy's
father had been- absent from the city
and State for some years and liis
whereabouts was unknown. Dewey
was born on June 18, 1S7S. in - Santa
Barbara County. .
Consent to the adoption and - re
lincuishment of all maternal rights to
the child were signed by the mother,
and the signatures of the Monniers
were attached to an agreement where-'
by the infant was to [ enjoy all the
rights and be subject to all the re
lations of a son.
MltS. 3IOXXIER'S STATEMENT.
Crv the occasion of a motion for con
tinuance of the trial of the contest In
Judge Coffey's court Mrs. Monnler at
first denied that she had ever partici
pated in any adoption proceedings,
then said she did not remember such
an incident. Before that her deposi
tion had been taken for use in
the hearing and she testified that
George Jr. had been brought to her
home by a Mrs. Darling. -In support
of his request for a postponement of
the case the young man made an affi
davit stating that he had never heard
that he was not Monnier's son until
the widow so - testified and he desired
time to Investigate his parentage. The
identity of his father, . if it was not
Monnier. is still a mystery. --"- ..
The amendments filed yesterday by
the young man assert that' George and
Anna Monnier were married on Janu
ary 3. 1S63, and that on or about June
18, 1878, the contestant was born of ; a
woman other than Anna- Monnier. and
that George Monnler was his father. *Â¦>
During the year .1882, it . is ,said,
George Monnler publicly acknowledged
the child as . his own son , and received
him as such with the consent of Anna
Monnier into, the family and ;from
thenceforth Â¦ until the day of Monnier's
death: September^ 4 last, continued
acknowledge him as his son and
treated him as if he ' ere a legitimate
child. â¢ ,
An insi>:ctlon of the adoption rec
ords of department 10 of the Superior
Court discloses facts at variance with
Mrs. Monnier's statement that the boy
had not been adopted and with the
contestant's declaration that he is the
son of the deceased.
George Monnler Jr. now says he Is
the natural son of George Monnler
and a. woman other than Anna Mon
nier, widow of the winemaker, whose
will the young man is contesting. He
also avers that he was legally adopted
by the Monniers with the consent of
his own mother. These contentions
are set forth in legal papers Just filed
In the probate department of the Su

and the identity of the Judge who

is the news brought by the British ship
Langdale. which has returned to this
harbor after an absence of nearly two
years. The log shows that this myste
rious mark," which is uncharted, was
sighted Sunday evening, September 4,
Just at dusk. The ship stood three
miles away and no nearer view was
had because approaching darkness pre
vented a small boat being lowered, but
to the crew the tree apepared of a
brownish color, a "dirty" brown, as the
salts describe it. It had seven branches,
which extended from the trunk. There
appeared to be no land at the base of
the. growth, and to all appearances It
might have sprouted from the briny
deep, but ..in the opinion of a few of
those who saw it the roots were Im
bedded in a coral reef. There are no
charted islands nearer -than 100 miles
to the spot. , The Langdale comes in
command of Captain Jones.

The French treaty, while not yet rati

not in force, is believed to be so care
fully, framed as to Insure favorable ac
tion in the last stage. If this is so, it
will be the first arbitration treaty of
general scope to which the United

here have made sufficient inquiry in
regard to the sentiment of the Parlia
ment to show that; the treaty will be

A GREAT . WORLD POWER
Mr. Chairman. Ladies and Gentlemen: I
hope you will erteem St as great a pleasure to
lwt'n to ir-e as It Is for me to be able to speak
to you. We are meeting here to-night to dls
Â¦ uft the- lFsuts of an ejection that Is world

earth -is awaiting the outcome of the vote upon
icsu^s- that affect international affairs.
In introducing Mr. Gage to the audi
ence Chairman McDougald referred to
him as the man that settled the great
water front strike and caused the re
turn to work of thousands of laborers.
This announcement was greeted with
cheers. After acknowledging his ap
preciation for the reception accorded
him Mr. Gage said in part:
Treasurer John E. McDougald pre
sided, being introduced to the audience
by Senator E. R. Woodruff, secretary
'of the Republican State Central Com
mittee. The" appearance of Governor
Cage at the speaker's chair was the
slgn&J for an enthusiastic demonstra
tion, for which he expressed his appre
ciation. Mr. Short was also warmly re
ceived, and Julius Kahn and E. A.
Hayes, who were seated on the plat
form, were cheered thrice and three
times more. Altogether the crowd was
an unusual one for- this campaign. It
demonstrated the fact that if sufficient
Democratic opposition could be found
it wu willing to enter the fray as of
old, and win out, too. It was not only
enthusiastic, but argumentative, in
support of the speakers' theories.'. The
bum of discussion in the audience was
often heard, and one man. grown too
excited, wm led to the street, where he
continued his harangue, with himself
the only interested auditor.
On behalf Â¦ of .Republican principles
and xtepublican candidates ex-Governor
Henry T. Gage addressed a great audi
ence at the Alhambra Theater last
evening. - Supporting and augmenting
his argument was Frank H. Short of
Fresno, who delivered a ringing speech
in .the interest of the dominant party
and the men it has named for office.
San Francisco has '. before it the greatest
possibilities, the greatest opportunities for de
velopment and ' the greatest resources . of any
city, to-day. You may . study tbÂ« conditions
along the entire coaet Una of the Pacific Ocean
and San Francisco Is the gateway of the west
ern world. In all that vast stretch of - land
that fronts the wofld's. moat 'majestic sea, for
the city that sits by < the Golden Gate there Is
no rival, and there can never be. : The citizens
of San Francisco . ought to be alive - to this
situation, to her greatness and , her oppor
tunities as a. city.* - They â¢ ought to be Imbued
with municlpa.1 pride; they ought to have and
Insist upon official honor â¢ and integrity. Wa
have no man too capable 'or. too 'large to ad
minister; the . affairs of thU ; city. None too
A quartet . followed Mr. Gage to the
platform and, its song concluded,"
Frank H. Short was introduced: Â¦ In
part he said:
SHORT IS INTRODUCED.
And- as for the greatness and prosperity of
the United States, we should be equal- In
strength to any world power.. With wars In
tha Orient, rumors of war around tha world,
the moment may come suddenly when this
country will be entangled. I believe that the
United " States should be able to guard her
lntemaUoaaJ lawsuits- with the: speed of the
American batUe*hlps. the power of American
guns and the valor of . American soldiers and
sailors.
It in a matter of record that the only, time
Federal troops were sent Into a State to quell
disorder was under Democratic administration
an* in Colorado, where the treatment of . the
laboring man was infamous, I consider ' it
utterly Indefensible and anarchistic to blow
up people and property. Any man who re
sorts to such anarchy deserves the condem
nation of every honest man within the - con
fines of this country. Â¦ -
One of the worst corporations ever 'existing,
whose trail is marked with . crime and lust for
gold, is the Standard Oil Company. It has
been under protection, but It carries a free
trsde commodity. â¢ ' Â¦
ATTACKS STANDARD OIL.
Who ever heard Davis or Parker saying any
thing against trusts" until after they . were
nominated? The records -will show what an
ardent trust man Judge Parker -" was. Ky
rendering two decisions of directly * opposite
construction be left a loophole for capital to
throttle labor in the American National Drug
Association ease. -XifjSttBMi! Â¦ â¢
Parker says "protection foster* trusts" and
yet we can point to ' free trade England | with
trusts upon trusts. In our own country many
of the trust* that are fattening are not pro
tected.
Bryan has been eloquent on' the evils of the
trusts. I looked over the records of Bryan
during his two terms in Congress, and can find
no trace of any time where the former leader
of Democracy by word or deed attempted to
Introduce laws to circumscribe the trusts. On
a!l the trust measures looking to the curbing
of the evil the Democrats have voted Indus
triously with thÂ« powers of corruption.'
The St. Louis convention is the only place
where the Democrats mentioned trusts. They
did not dare to nay a word on the money
question, although for eight years they de
clared the money question the paramount
issue. The party had to do something so they
dipped their pen In molasses instead of Ink
arnd wrote the plank in the platform for cam
paign purposes. It was not written in good
faith. Their conduct wu reprehensible and
any party resorting to aucb tricks should be
defeated.
The -President needs the electidh of .Julius
Kuhn in the Fourth Congressional District; he
needs the election of Duncan McKinlay up
ncrtb; he needs the election of Gillett, Hayes,
Needham and Smith, and he'll get the election
of Jim - McLachian of Los Angeles. . Do net
vote with wild hurrah for .Roosevelt- and. then
tie him hand and foot politically tjy electing
Democratic legislators. - . -~
Ham McKinley. And these principles are
blended' with the adminstratlon of Theodore
Roosevelt, and our President has been and will
txs true to those principles, which will be ac
cepted by the people on election day. The pol
ices of Republicanism will lead the republic
to loftier heights. At no time in history has
the United States been so respected as during
the seven years of McKinley and Â¦ Roosevelt. -

I "believe In'polltlcal leadership Our sue-"

REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES.
In my Judgment it will be a calamity to
San Francisco if Roosevelt 13 not Â«lacted Pres
ident, but he will be and the calamity will only
he lessened If he Is elected and representatives
with views contrary to his and contrary to
nearly everybody else's arÂ«- chosen' to mis
represent San Kranctsco in . Congress. This Is
an important and serious matter. I : do not
want you to vote your . prejudices or your
personal likes or. dislikes 'If you . have any.
Make up your minds . what " is best for San
Francltco Â»nd you will already have decided
what is best for you. r B<Â» Americans and be
Californians, and vote . as such and you will
not vote wrong.
Roosevelt Is to be elected â the. Republican
party Is to be continued in power. Will this
city be better represented by men ' belonging
to the party Jn jiower and in sympathy with
the President or by men whose views are
antagonistic to thesu policies. , and who. both
an a matter â¢ of politics and 'as a matter of
policies, are antagonistic to the President? -
The Democratic party does not stand for
these things. It ' promises . to cut down the
general expenditures of the Government onÂ«
half â that means lets Improvement for ; our
rivers and harborsâ less public buildings are
to be erected â less ships for the navy., are
to .be -constructed â less material, is ... to- .bÂ«
used â less labor' is to be employed and " less
wages Hra to be paid. If ,,you believe Â¦ In I the
policy of contraction â if you believe In the
economy that curtails, public Improvements â
If you are opposed . to the protective tariff â
if you want Parker electedâ if you want Roose
velt defeated â If you want to return to thÂ«
Cleveland administration, . bo much" loved" and
extolled by Mr. Parker, you ' ought â¢ to â¢ vote
for- Democratic Congressmen; but If you are
for Rooseveltâ ir you believe in Â¦ Republican
policies and want them continued, you ought
to vote for the men that believe in these

' Senator Knowland was most en
thusiastically received- and held the
close attention of the. audience
throughout his address. The speaker
convincingly answered the argument
advanced by his Democratic oppo
nents at. a meeting held here several
weeks ago, many of the' Republican
nominee's statements being, loudly ap
plauded. â¢ Knowland called attention
to the benefits California had enjoyed
under Republican policies and spoke
particularly of what the building of
the Panama canal meant to this State.
He predicted that California, realizing
these facts, would roll up. a Roosevelt
plurality of more than 30,000 and
elect a solid Republican Congressional
delegation, j The meeting closed with
three rousing cheers for the Republi
can ticket.
"PORT COSTA, Nov. 2.â Under the

Belshaw, nominee for State Senator,
and Harry Ells, Assembly candidate.

towns. L. N. Buttner presided.
. Senator Belshaw was accorded an
ovation as he faced the audience. , He
first , took up the constitutional
amendments, pointing out the strong
and weak points in each. He then
entered upon an able discussion of
the issues of the campaign.

. Candidates of the Union Labor party
held forth; a Hall
last night. - A band was in attendance
and struck up "We" Won't Go Home
Till Morning" T as each* candidate ap-'
peared. Â¦ The - gathering -was- presided
over by Thomas Eagan, chairman of
the Union Labor County Committee.
Daniel W. -â¢ Burchard, candidate for
Superior Judge, was the first speaker.
In a fiery manner ' he scored those
whom he declared maligned Mayor
Eugene Schmitz. "In spite of the lies
that have been told about him, he is
the soul of honor," said Burchard.
"There have been more, lies told about
him arid Abe Ruef r r.n would patch
hades a mile." ' \ , Â¦ :
While Burchard was talking E. J.
Liivernash entered and .he crowd be
gan to call for him. Livernash said in
part: % .'. ;-
I â¢ have "many other engagements, but I
want to drive a nail Into several lies before
I leave this hall. Every day new lies are'
leveled at me. . not because I am Livernash,
but because I represent you. I am not afraid
to come here and tell you so. I am not afraid
to go any place, not even to Dupont and Fil
bert streets. ' ... ' . , , â¢
Â¦ The Mayor and I disagree on several points,
but we are agreed on one thingâ our devotion
to union labor principles. I stand shoulder
to shoulder with those who are battling for
unionism. Â¦'- Let us all at this crisis stand to
gether. . , < At this point Judge Frank Murasky
entered and was cheered.) '
v -I- will now make a departure from the thread
of my discourse to pay a personal tribute 'to
a personal friend whom I have known from
boyhood. He is a man of high Ideals, ardent,
earnest and consistent: His name is Frank
Murasky. .'. Work for him and vote for him. -
I do 'not ' think- that you will fall me. X
hare an abiding . faith In. the manliness of the
working people. ' and the worklngmen 'consti
tute an Â¦ easy , majority of the voters of this
city." I gave up a salary of '$10,000 a yeai
to stand for -unionism. If you do not return
me ! to Congress the loss will be yours. I
have nothing .to lose. Although calumnies are
spread, let us be calm. Calmness Is consistent
with great courage. Let us be silent : and
v6te our convictions.
Mayor Schmitz followed ; Livernash
and appealed for Judge Conlan's elec
tion as Superior. Judge.
Conlan said in part: "Thank
you for this reception. I have tried to
the .best of my ability while on the
police bench to deal 'out justice :.nd
fair. play. I purpose .to continue in
that same groove until the end,. of my
existence. I can repeat my
pledges.':
Judge Murasky said: "I find myself
embarrassed by those laudations. It is

only say that I, will live up to the

! Judge J.' A. Barham of | Santa Rosa,
a former Congressman, made a telling
speech on the issues, devoting the most
of his time to a discussion of the tariff.
He told his auditors they were voting
to destroy the prosperity now being en
joyed in casting their ballots for the
party of free trade. He compared
Judge Conley with Judge Parker, in
that both are making statements on the
stump that are absolutely without
foundation, thus winning, the ridicule
of .hundreds and thousands of voters.
Barham excited laughter and tremend
ous applause by saying he has advised
Conley, as his personal friend; to make
up his mind that he can best serve his
State and best preserve the respect of
his constituents by remaining on the
bench, for while he has made a good
Judge he has proved . himself a mighty
poor politician.

Revised Statutes of the United States.
; REDWOOD CITY, Nov. 2.^-Word was
received here â¢ to-night ' that " a "deputy
United States Marshal from San Fran
cisco had gone to Halfmoon Bay to ar
rest Supervisor Joseph , da Benede ttt for
feloniously . obtaining a certificate of
citizenship ' for : himself and presenting
the same to the Registrar. Consider
able surprise. Is evidenced at this news,
as Mr. de Benedetti is well known and
highly respected.. He 'has held the of
fice of Supervisor for eight years. It is
thought', that there must be some mis
take or that it is" a political move
sprung at the last, moment to further
the interests of Mr. de Benedettl's op
ponent in the' Supervisor fight.', .. . - i
Nothing 1s; known here of the partic
ulars of the charge, but the opinion is
expressed thaf if the charge is made to
injure Mr. de Benedetti's chances .of
election it will have the opposite effect.
The complaint .charges De Bene
detti with having feloniously present
ed a certificate of his own citizenship
issued September. 1, 1873, which
showed on Its face that he had been
admitted as a citizen of the United
States, he well knowing at the time
that the certificate had been unlaw
fully Issued to him at Redwood City.
It is alleged that De Benedetti repre
sented under oath that he first arrived
in the United States under 18 years of
age and that he was a subject of the
Kingdom of Italy and had resided five
years In the United States next pre
ceding his twenty-first year, whereaa
he had not arrived in the United
States until he was 20. years of age
and could not" become- a citizen until
he had first declared under oath.be
fore a court of record renouncing hi3
allegiance to the . Kingdom of ' Italy
and declaring his intentions two years
prior to applying for such certificate.
Woodworth says he has received In
formation that De Benedetti has In
duced about two hundred Italian
aliens to procure certificates of citi
zenship by falsely swearing' that they,
had come to this country under the
age of 18 years and had resided five
years In the United States next preced
ing their twenty-first year. .Upon
these certificates, thus, feloniously
obtained, the aliens were placed upon
the Great Register of San Mateo Coun

Deputy United States Marshal George

It is said that a plot whereby 100
votes were to be cast by aliens in San

candidates for Presidential Electors

by the vigilance of United States Dis

THICKNESS OF HIS SKULIi
SAVES HIM- FROM DEATH
TACOMA, Nov. 2.â Because ' he was
carried from Ketchikan to Seattle
against his will, Rev. Thomas Jenkins
of Ketchikan has libeled the steamer
City of Seattle and asked the Federal
court to allow him such compensation
is it finds" proper. On October 10 last
Rev. Mr. Jenkins boarded the steamer
while it was docked at Ketchikan to
bid farewell to friends among the pas
sengers. The sharp blast of the whistle
soon informed him that the vessel was
leaving, and on rushing out he found
the gangplank had been pulled In. He
hurried on the- bridge, demanding of
Captain Nicolson that he be put. ashore.
By that time the steamer was well out
in the stream, and the captain in
formed him that it would be impossible
to land him. A three days' voyage un
der these circumstances' left the i cler
gyman in a very â¢ unhappy state of
mind. He now alleges the. entire trip
was for him a period of the greatest
mental anguish. He left his wife and
children without saying farewell, and
was only thinly clad for a sea voyage.
He thinks the discomfort resulting
from Captain Nicolson's alleged ar
bitrary action entitles him to damages.

Judge Parker's speech was almost en
.tirely devoted to the subjects of lm
perUnzm and militarism. He said:

.When we annexed the Pml:p:ilnej It was

Now. what 'was that lesson? " That more
gess - should be mounted ? But did It not
occur to the Secretary that tbe real and far
more important lesson was a very different
one ? Only recall the circumstances under
which the Incident took place.
Great Britain, engared In a boundary dispute
with Venexuela, urged ' her contention with
The imperialistic tendency, armed with that
power will be all the more dangerous when
It Is at the â¢ame tUne armed with an ample
aupply of fighting material ready for action.
Untn . a very recent period we enjoyed the
priceless blessing of llvlnj In perfect, peace
and sÂ«ourlty without bearing the burden of a
large army and c*vy costing untold ndHJjns
a yearâ a unique privilege of which other
nations groaning under' heavy military and
naval expenditures, envied us most heartily.
Our Imperialists now tell us that this must
cease to be Â»d. According to them, we must
have a much larger army In proportion than
before, ar.d our Secretary of the Navy as
sures us that we must have the biggest navy
In the world, whatever the cost.
Have you ever *een anybody able- to give
yon an intelligent and satisfactory reason
why we must ha\e those things? Some say
we must have them to protect our commerce.
I ask. then, has there ever been a elngle mo
ment since the year 'lSlO whin our commerce
suffered In the least from the want of a big
nary to protect it? Others Â«ay we must have
it to enforce the Monroe doctrine. Was there
ever before or since our Civil War. a single
occo*lon when the Monroe doctrine was, so
to speak, unable to enforce itself without a
big army or navy? Our worthy Secretary of
War. In a recent speech before the Union
League Club Illustratedâ without thinking of
Itâ how unnecessary a big army and navy
Are to us for any of theae purposes. HÂ« said :
"Under the second Cleveland administration
wÂ« were by President Cleveland's mes?a?e on
the Venezuelan boundary question, brought to
the brink of war' with Great Britain. Now,
bow many guns do you think there were on
the coast ? There was Just one modern gua
mounted." . . â¢
' After the laughter called forth by that,re
mark had' subsided. Secretary Taft continued:
"That taught the P.epubllcans a lesson."
GREATER ARMY AND NAVY
The President may then force a war upon
the country In spite of the adverse opinion of
Congress. He may do this, keeping, as to the
exercise of his powers, within the letter of the
constitution, although flagrantly violating Its
spirit and intent. And he may do this, almost
sure of the subsequent approval and support
of Congress, which, when an accomplished
fact has i>ut our country In an attitude more
or less hostile to a foreign power, is usually
very reluctant to disavow our Government.
We have "an illustration of this in the his
tory of the Panama Canal, it being very doubt
ful whether Congressâ even the Republican
part cf Itâ would have approved the policy
pursued b> the -administration, while the ac
complished fact easily commanded the accept
ance of the majority. â¢â¢
This power of thÂ» executive is evidently a
very dangerous one â dangerous to the peace or
the country.- aÂ« well as to the Integrity of our
institutionsâ unless the President cherishes a
conscientious respect for tbe constitutional lim
itations of his .power and an overruling desire
religiously to observe the spirit and intent as
well as the letter of the constitution, as well
as an Innate love of -peac- and fair dealing.
You may Judge for yourselves how dangerous
Is such a power under the Influence of the Im
perialistic tendency, with the lust of conquest
and dominion. Us love of adventure and ro
tary achievement and its progress to Impul
sive action 'and dramatic display.
This is only an initial attempt to dominate
public opinion in behalf of the Government.
But there will be more of It. if the Imperialis
tic fcp'rit is serciltted to prevail.
In this revpect we -must not fall to keep In
view the treat; power wielded by the Presl
dÂ«m in the conduct of our foreign relations.
The Constitution provides that only Congress
shall have power to declare war. But it is
within thÂ« power of the President, if be de
srres war, to create, by his conduct of our
foreign- relaticni. situations which make war
inevitable. It may happen that on such an
occasion Congress, having opposed war, would
no; consent to it if consulted beforehand; but
it -may be confronted by thing* already dons,
by accomplished facts, which make the es?apÂ«
from war exceedingly difficult, if not impos
sible.
Now. what does this mean? Democratic
government' Is essentially government by public
discussion. That discussion must be enlight
ened-by the knowledge of the truth as to mat
ten, of public â¢ interest, the fullest possible
information to be frankly furnished by tbe
Government. It must. In order to serve its
end. be actually free; so as to Illume every
side of the question to be decided. And now
we are told that we should not freely discuss
a question of such stupendous Importance as
that whether the* United States should remain
a simple democratic republic or become a
colonial empire: that the principles of our re
public should -not be mentioned in connection
-with the matter lest our colonial subjects hear
of it. and that, as the administration knew
this business best, the people should leave it
1} the administration to determine the course
to be taken concerning it.
PRESIDENT COULD FORCE WAR.
' â¢ It denies it Out with regard to 'the sub
jugated alien population. ' If tbe imperialistic
tendency cccttnues we shall soon have the
seme experience at home. In fast they are
already beginning to appear. . You cannot fall
to notice that whenever you quote the prin
ciples proclaimed in the Deolaration of Inde
peudence in connection with, the case of the
Filipinos you are fiercely assailed as un
patriotic citizens, who are stirring up our sub
jects to revolt. In fact, a member of the
administration, in speaking of the present and
fi ture of the Philippines, stopped little short
of admonishing us that every public discussion
o? that eubject â unless It be In entire harmony
with the policy ot, the administration â should
stop, fqr the reason that It might excite hopfs
among our "subjects" which the administra
tion is unwilling to gratify.
But let rr.e ask them as citizens of a dem
ocratic republic what the true source ot the
Just powers can be if not the consent of the
governed? Is It force? That would be des
potism. Is It wealth? That would be plu
tocracy. Is it the privilege of birth or posi
tion in society? That would be aristocracy.
What remalne. then, as the source of the Just
powers of free government but the consent of
the governed In its ranga and effect regulated
by telf.inade laws? You deny that and you
deny the vital principle of 'democratic insti
tutions. And imperialism does deny.lt.
TRUE SOURCE OF POWER.
haa been carried oa and Is now defended by
the Republican party, wÂ« cannot but feel seri
ous aaxletv as to the permanence of demo
cratic institutions among us. The great prin
ciple* proclaimed by the Declaration of In
dependence â that governments derive their
Juft poweis from the consent of the governed"
â stood substantially unquestioned among us
until the imperial policy of conquest and arbi
trary rule over the conquered \waÂ» entered
upon. It was recosmlxed as the' very essence
or democratic institutions. Xow it is scoffed at
by many of the leaders of the Republican
party as a- srlitterlna: generality that has. no
practical meaning and application; as baby
talk, fit for the infancy of this nation, but
ridiculous in Its nresent state of power. .In
deed. It la perfectly logical for them to deride
and reject it If they meant to Justify and main
tain their policy of conquest and dominion.
Judge Parker was driven from Cooper
Union to Carnegie Hall, .where ' he { ad

of the West Side Parker Independent

Judge i Parker, dwelt- upon Â¦;< the 'exac

TALKS TO WEST SIDERS.
Should we not divert our material an well
as mental resources to the building up of our
(treat country, which- Is capable of infinitely
greater development than it has bo . far at
tained, and to the solution of the political and
social problem which surge upon us? --
Should we not cultivate peace and friend
ship with all nations, scrupulously respecting
their rights ni well a* their legitimate feel-
Ings, spreading our commerce over the world
not at the cannon'* mouth, but by intelligent
and Industrious striving for superiority in
friendly competition as to the quality and pro
portionate price of cur goods?.
By *o doing we should present to the world
the Inspiring example of a truly free people.
peaceable, and orderly, self-respecting and
happy (n their freedom and prosperity.
Such an example will do Infinitely more to
advance our own welfare, as well as the peace
and civilization ot mankind, than tny num
ber nf battleshlns and all the splendor of im
perial power.
I ask rou in all soberness, is It not best for
i^J^f^A , Wâ¬ ".u bein;r and happiness . of our
VZwZ * nd , for "if Preservation of our free in
stitution*, to which we owe so much of our
growth in comfort, wealth and power, that. In
stead of influUlng our ambition in adventurous
policy cf empire and dominion over foreign
countries and alien populations: Instead of
squandering our substance In wholly unnÂ«cÂ»s
eary war establishment*, at Immense cost; In
stead of sacrificing: the great conservative prin
ciples and high Ideals we inherited from the
fathers to the false glitter of imperial great
neÂ«s. which at rII periods of human history has
marked the decay and perdition of republics;
Instead of provoking the distrust of all man
kind by the display of armed force : on every
possible occasion which raises 'a suspicion of
vague and hazardous , Â«chÂ«mes of restless am
bition lurking in the backgroundâ we should
return to the principles .and Ideals which dur
ing the first century of our national existence
have proved so Just and beneficent, so that
government by the people and for the people
may not perish from the earth?
A DANGEROUS PLAYTHING.
It will be apt to produce another perilous
effect. It has often, and not unjustly, been
observed that the frequency of homicide in our
country Is coming in great part to the habit
of many persona in carrying unnecessary â¢ pis
tols on their persons. Likewise a great war
fleet, especially a new one that is not em
ployed in necessary duties, may become a se
ductive and dansrerous plaything. While Ita
advocates unre that it Is to prevent trouble,
it If- Just as apt. by Impulsive and reckless
handling, to cause mlschler. 'When warships
are too liberally flung about the world they
are occasionally exsowd to seductive tempta
tions and troubles. It may become a risk
rather than a nrotection.
You, Mr. Chairman, have had reason to
know what militarism ia and what It means.
You have seen and felt Its bllghtinr power.
The glowing lrrmulses of your young man
w. v y Â£ ur attach Â« 1 Â«nt to the spirit of liberty
which ban characterized Germany from the
days of Tacitus, your yearning for better
things for your country and the worldâ all
these would clash with martial glory and
power, the inevitable accompaniments of em
pire, whether real or only in shadow.
Your devotion to high Ideals soon earned yos
the admiration of your native land, and It has
been given to you to live in a time when your
warning voice has been raised to avert thÂ«
first faint suggestion that the love of martial
glory and its dangers are not absent from the
greatest republic In the world's history.
. And you. too. the men who listen to me.
know either by your fathers or grandfathers
what martial glory means. It forced many of
you from home In the tender years of your
lives, whfn careful parental nurture was both
your need and your due.
This would have a most unfortunate effect.
Whether we entertain such . plans or not â and
I am confident a large majority of the Amer
ican peosle do not entertain tfcem â the world
will always be dlstruntful of our â¢, professions
of a Deareful disoosltlon. However smooth
our speech may be in favor of peace con
gress;* and arbitration courts, the world will
tee In the building of large navies, utterly un
necessary for defense, a threat of armed ag
gression â a transformation of the old republi
can policy into an empire preparing for war.
The result will be disquiet among nations.
Every sea Dower will watch with nervous
anxiety each unnecessary addition to our naval
strength, io see in It a reason for making a
corresponding addition to its own. And thus
the road race .in the augmentation of -war
forces, -which has become an oppressive burden
to mankind â tbe curse of the an â will be
stimulated by this republic, instead of being
discountenanced and checked by its good ex
ample of a truly pacific policy. This republic
will thus be a leader of. backward and most
baneful movements. Instead of leadlmr In
humane projects. Â¦-.â¢ . -â¢ â¢ .-â¢ '
Now, what Is the les*on of this? Not that
we need big armies and navies for the* de
ftnse of our rights and the enforcement of
our Just demands, but that, whether | we are
armed or unarmed, I every European- power,
even the. greatest and proudest, will go to the
very extreme of possible concession to avoid
a serious quarrel with this republic. Every
sensible man knows that there is not one of
thos* powers which entertains Â¦ the slightest
idea of attacking us; that they will readily
comply with whatever we can decently aak
for. and that if we are to have any conflict
with any one cf them we shall have to bring
It on ourselves, by unendurable provocation.
The simple reason is. that aside from what
moral love of peace they may cherish they
can hardly afford to have a serious struggle
with so resourceful and pertinacious an an
tagonist as this republic In view of the poe
s-Sbllity of dangerous complications at home.
Our absolute safety from foreign aggreitElon,
a.* every reasonable person will admit, being
thus assured. I may ask my sober-minded
ccuntrymen for what purpose large armies
and big naviesâ the characteristic tool - and
fsvorite ornament of empire â may be wanted
by us. Being entirely unnecessary for defense,
is the greatest navy In the world, or any big
navy, the coat of construction and maintenance
of which will run Into the hundreds of mil
lions needed or intended for any other .pur
pose? If not, then the building and main
tenance thereof Is a wanton waste of the peo
ple's money, wicked and unpardonable. - But
It It is designed for any other purpose what
is that purpose? The world abroad will but
too .plainly see In It a design of aggressive
movements on our part.
But what did Great Britain do? The -Tory
Government took President- Cleveland's re
monstrance into respectful consideration and
with graceful kindness assented to the arbitra
tion asked for. . . " -
Great Britain, the mistress of the seas, by
far the greatest naval power of the world,
proud and touchy, with a Tory Government
supposed to be the especial champion of that
prtde, was certainly net used to that sort of
treatment. She probably knew, too. that we
had only one gun mounted on a coast several
thousand miles long. No wonder that. a good
many people expected the British lion to break
out in Â¦ a, warlike roar.
GREAT BRITAIN YIELDS.
characteristic posltlveneas. The President of
the United States stepped In a&d substantially
said -to Great Britain: "Stop! You will not
be permitted to Impose your will upon the
little American republic by main strength
without a word from this republic. This mat
ter will have to be arbitrated."
Kxtraordinary powers these, and marking
an extraordinary - faith of a people In its
elected chief executive. - And how has this
administration responded to -this . trust? It
placed at the head of this new department as
the first Secretary of the Department of Com
merce of the United States the private sec
retary of the President When the. campaign
opened the secretary â¢ resigned his office, And
at the request and as the personal representa
tive of the; President became the chairman of
the Republican National Committee.' to bring
about, if it might be, the returnof his patron
to the Presidency. And lest any should err,
it waa at the time of his resignation author
itatively announced that at the termination
ot the campaign he would be summoned again
to the Cabinet to fill another Cabinet office.
I leave It to. you. to say , whether or, not, in
your estimation the vicious' circle is exempt.
Now, all of these are not conditions under
which free institutions can be preserved. We
are not yet prepared for empire. We still
intend that this .shall bÂ« a republic, but it
behooves us to guard Jealously the liberties
which were' transmitted to us.- And if the
unscrupulous use of power by any party or
by any person becomes apparent It behooves
us -to check It by the exercise of the ballot,
the constitutional prerogative given us for that
purpose. And this without : regard as to
whether the exercise of unconstitutional powers
by an individual be malicious or tempera
mental.- -
An example la before us of how the effort
of the people to free themselves from a. bur
den can' be" seized upon 'by the unscrupulous
and Itself made the agency whereby the burden
Is bound more firmly upon their backs. '
The clamor of the people asalnst the trusts
rose to such a. point ; that recognition wu
necessary- A. new department of the Govern
ment was created by the. Department of Com
merce. To that department was Intrusted In
quisitorial power over the sp-eat corporations.
Its head the Secretary of. Commerce, was
made a Cabinet officer. But lest honest busi
ness Interests should suffer, lest unscrupulous
competitor* should take funfair advantage. It
was provided that the results, of the . depart
ment's investigations into the affairs of any
corporation should be confidential. ThÂ»y were
ta be placed Mn. the first Instance at the dis
position of the President. - -

Will of the Late Samuel
Alexander Disposes of a
Great Amount of Wealth
Fate of Eome Hangs Over
Slav Empire According
to Eabbi Eriedlander
The finances of the North Shore Rail
road, which recently passed to the con
trol of A. "W. Foster, president of the
California Northwestern, are in a bad
shape. Yesterday it became known
that the corapani had defaulted In thÂ«
payment of its semi-annual Installment
of interest on Its bonded Indebtedness,
which was due the previous day. Lo
cal financiers are speculating; as to
what action the bondholders will take.
A. 'W. Foster, who succeeded John
Martin as . president cf the road, . Ad
mitted yesterday that tha Interest had
not been paid, and was unable to say
what move the officials of tha com
pany would make; but he did not give
evidence of any great uneasiness.
The amount due the bondholders, is
$87,500, representing the semi-annual
payment of 2% per cent on $3,500,000,
the latter being protected by a mort
gage on the company's property, held
In trust by the Mercantile Trust Com
pany of thl3 city for the Eastern syndi
cate that furnished the money for
financing the railroad project. Presi
dent Foster . admits that the North
Shore has -been unable to meet Its ob
ligation. â¢ Â¦ â¢ .
He remarked that he did not think
that the bondholders' were worrying,
however, for no calls had been made
on the company's treasurer for the
amounts due them. When asked if he
was prepared to state when the com
pany would likely be able to pay the
interest President Foster said:
I really do not know when we can mak* this
'payment. The truth Is w* hav* bean strug
gling along, and the company has not. made
enough money to meet the payment. Under
the law we hare six months In which %o pay
the Interest before the bondholder* can fore
close. It may bjÂ» somÂ« time befor* the matter
la straightened out,- but I am hopeful of over
coming the financial difficulties. At present,
howÂ«ver. the earnings of the road are barely
sufficient to meet the operating expenses of
the company. Â¦ Â¦
That the North Shore road was in a
bad way has been a matter of general
knowledge for some time In the local
financial . world, and Â¦ this fact- Is sup
posed to have, prompted the John Mar
tin syndicate to undertake- , the dis
posal. of. the road. '. : \t .was ; first offered
.to the Santa Fe Company/.' which- re-j
fused it>on the ground, '"as"; stated* by.
Cap'afn A. H. J-aybon. assistant to,
President RIpley. that the -price ( de
manded by the Martin jyndL-ate waa
too 1 high, i Â¦ Later j John \ Martin . went
Cast J and , shortly , after he left Â¦_ this
city It became' no'.Â«M.. around ;that: : he
was trying to float the road on the New
York market. Meanwhile . savers!;. of
the 'original' combine Â¦ which purchased
the road from th<? North Pacific Coa3t
Company withdrew, fjrom the North
Shore - Company and the financing of,
the corporation . devolved mainly on
John Martin and Eugene de Sabla.
A- deal' for the transfer of the road
to Foster .was 'effected In August '.last
and Immediately after he'fuccseded
Martin as president and selected a new
board \pt directors, the members -of
which 'are .his personal friends." ? â¢';
Although President Foster persistent
ly den fed that the Southern Paotfle. or
any -/other big corporation was behind
him;in-th& acquirement of the- North
Shore road, sttae local financiers^ were
strongly. Inclined to. favor, the- story
of the street that Foster was merely
acting for E. H: Harriman. Yester
day's default, however, would suggest
that the Harriman syndicate* is not
connected with the deal, for it }s ar
gued that Harriman would not" have
permitted the credit -of one of hia cor
porations to be discredited 'by a de
fault in the" payment of Interest to
bondholders. . â¢ ' . * r . . -
The officials of the Mercantile Trust
Company, declined Jo make any state
ment regarding the failure of the road
to pay its interest. A prominent banker
volunteered the statement that he was
sure that President Foster, who stands
high In the regard of local banks, will
be able to get out of his present trou

Rabbi Frledlander told the ladles* of
the- Oakland .Club something;- about
Russia and the Crar^s Government to
day.,. The -'Rabbi declared -that the
Slav empire -would fall, as did Rome.
Dr. Friedlander declared that Russia
was an Asiatic and not a European
state; that the people, even the nobil
ity, were educated only In books, and
declared the Czar to be the greatest
dictator in the world. Said the doctor:
Geographically, ethnologically and politically
Russia Is to-day exactly what she was In the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before the
conquest; of the Baltic provinces by Peter the
Great, essentially an Asiatic state.. She has
nothing In common with Europe or Europeans.
This has been shown In her acts toward other
nations in - the recent troubles. - and by her
shifty and untrustworthy diplomacy. Russia
may have culture, but it Is the culture that
consists only of a knowledge of books and not
the,culture that consists of a knowledge of the
human spirit. ' ' Â¦

held up the crew. While one man
kept the crew covered the other rifled

The demonstration was a direct reÂ»
suit of Nance's official order.
Issued yesterday, directing that all the
men of his class form In regular sec

where his instruction is given. .The
men had incurred the commandant's
displeasure a week ago by shuffling
into his classroom in what he called
"schoolboy fashion.". The commandant
determined to insure better order and
issued a. bulletin, assigning sections
in the classroom to certain bodies of
men and particular rows of- seats for
subdivisions of the section. Each dl^
vision had a monitor, who waa di
rected to preserve order. .

PROFESSOR SHOUTS "COWARDS."
. Professor Setchell. one of the most
revered of the faculty, called, them
''cowards," referred to them as "men
without honor." bade them feel
ashamed and assured them that they
were bringing disgrace upon their uni
versity. He begged them to remem
ber that their "riotous conduct would
be known at Washington," and urged
that they consider the stain the uni
versity, name would bear because of
their conduct. He assured them that
Sacramento would know of the dis
turbance, and that it would be re
garded with dismay by the' State au
thorities. .
. 'The professor's remarks, fell, ap
parently, upon deaf ears. The crowd
of students that surged around him
yelled: "Down In front." They
whistled and hooted, yelled for the co
eds to "take off their hats." and cried
"Nancy â Nancyâ we want Nancy,"
In derision -of their military in
structor, who acts as professor of
military- science and tactics.
W. H. Dehm, president of the A. S.

BERKELEY, - Nov. ; 2. â No more

than, that provided this afternnon by
the students under Captain J. T.

stration took place on . the campus
and | three hundred of the captain's
class openly mutinied, Â¦ refusing to
march into his classroom in the man
ner prescribed by him or in any other
manner! They hooted and; jeered
Professor. W. A. Setchell when he
sought to reason with < them, and
shouted.with joy when a mock. figure
of Captain Nance : , was put on a pedes
tal before them. '.-..-'.. . ... . /,. :
Captain Nance refused to discuss the.
matter until - he had conferred with
President Wheeler. . --,rv .â¢â¢-:'". ',<''
The appeal was an impassioned one,
but was not heeded. Instead of the
revered and dignified professor speak
ing:, it. might have been the wind sigh
ing â¢ along . the eaves of North Hall.
The men 'continued to 'Jeer and. hoot
and yell * their contempt for Captain
Nance and his. military order, :_
In front of Professor Setchell, not ten
feet, distant,, was again perched | the
youngster with the bell, and the^boy
again, rang It," to the crowd's 'apparent
delight. Not until the men were worn
out with their exertions did they, cease
and leave the, spot. Jt*"i"^7i' -Â»---u
"I thought there 'were some men In
this college," 'cried Professor Setchell,
"but I was mistaken. I consider that
you are cowards, without a sense of
honor, willing to disgrace .yourselves
and your university. I . see men here
whom I know and .whom I grieve to
behold In such a demonstration as,
this. Be assured that there will be
more to this and that the end is not
In sight for â¢ you who are responsible
for this affair." ' > . ,-,;
SETCUELJi'S EFFORTS FAII*.
Captain Nance went promptly to his
classroom at 4 o'clock, but there was
no class to meet him. While he, stood
quietly in the 'classroom, awaiting de
velopments the faculty called upon
Professor W. A. Setchell. a beloved In
structor, to address- the mutinous stu
dents. Professor Setchell took his
stand in the center of the mob and
tried to make himself heard, but he
failed. . ;:Â¦â¢."-'-.";
At 4 o'clock a band of students ap
peared with a six-year-old boy in their
midst. The youngster was attired in
military uniform, with a huge placard
on his chest labled, "Captain Nance.
A military,, cap. was , perched on his
baby curls. In his hands waa a school
master's bell. On the shoulders of the
brawny upper classmen the child was
perched, ringing , the bell, while the
crowd, cheered and ] howled Its appre
ciation of the travesty upon Captain
Nance's alleged attempt to put the
classmen under "schoolboy discipline."
word was passed along that a demon
stration of a spectacular sort against
Captain Nance and his odious order
would occur at the time^set for the
first march of the men Into the class
room. A crowd gathered In anticipa
tion of the demonstration and fully a
thousand spectators witnessed the af
fair.
At tfce time eet for the entrance of
the students to the building: they were
a mob and not In military formation.
The feeble attempts of the monitors to
preserve order went for nothing.
Juniors, sophomores and seniors In
squads swept up and down the walk in
front of the building, -' pandemonium
reigning.
Clods of dirt and bunches of ' grass
went flying in all directions. Youths
with tin boilers beat them noisily.
There were ' vagrant yells that finally
settled down Into a steady call^ of
"Nancyâ Nancyâ we want Nancy!"

The Polyglot Club held its first meet-
Ing for this season last night In the
United Arts and Crafts building. Under
the supervision of the president, Louis
D. Ventura, a. programme of excellent
quality was presented and engaged the
close attention of a large audience.
Some of the numbers were out of the
usual set lines,- notably a group of old
compositions ranging from 1620 to 1761
was played by R. A. Lucchesl on the
old dementi cembalo. "Claccona," for
violin and piano, played by Nathan
Landsberger and Mrs. Otto Bendix, was
artistic In beauty and execution. ThÂ©
recitation" of a portion of Dante's "Par
adise" by .Miss Grace Llewelyn Jones
was an exquisite gem.. Her voice was
well suited, with its soft modulations,
to the extract, and an organ accompa
niment by Slgnor Lucchesi gave fine
coloring to the poem. Signor Ventura's
opening address was appropriate to the
occasion, and during the programme hÂ©.
gave a French comedy bit that was ex
hilarating. Others who took part were
Miss Viva Hikey. Miss Mabel Vander
hoof, Mrs. P. de T. Evans, Miss Flor
ence Darby and Mrs. M. A. Tomkin.
At the entertainment at the Alham

knew the soldier. priest in the Philip

; LONDON, Nov. 2.â That elaborate
but somewhat futile ceremony-^the
election of a Lord Mayor of London,
having resulted as every one previously
knew it wouldâ Alderman Pound will
be sworn into office on November S as
the civic figurehead of the biggest city
In' the world, as Lady Mayoress his
wife will share In his, dignities and as-
Fist him in dispensing hospitality at
the Mansion House, which constitutes
the chief function of this once high and
stately office.
John Pound, now the Right Honor
able Lord Mayor-elect of London, is 75
years old. He inherited a flourishing
business from his father and. is very
wealthy. That Js the llrst and most es
sential qualification of a Lord Mayor,
for although his salary equals that of
the President of the United Statesâ
$50,000 a yearâ he is expected to spend
twice as much more in giving sumptu
ous banquets, maintaining the official
residence in proper style arid setting a
generous example by liberal donations
to charities. As the Lord Mayor en
tertains the King and a host of other
dignitaries, and is invariably knighted
before his one year term of office ends,
the rewards are considered well worth
the price paid for them.
IN LINE FOR THE PLACE.
The Lord Mayor's bailiwick comprises
only a small portion of .Londonâ that
which is known as the "city" â some
thing, under a mile Bquare in area with
the Mansion House as its center. The
rest of the vast human beehive. Is gov
erned by the London County Council,'
an admirable body that' does its work
in up-to-date fashion without any use
less - ceremonial paraphernalia. The
real Mayor of = London is chairman . of
that body. : But' the honors all go to
the â¢ puppet Mayor, who, though shorn
of most ; of his ancient powers, Is sur
rounded.with more â¢ pomp and cere
mony, show and glitter, stuff and non
sensethan the conrt of royalty itself.;
he had, to : do. was to sit tight and : wait
his turn. In due course of time he was
made Sheriff, filling that purely orna
mental office for -one year, and then
taking his place on the Mayoralty wait
ing list among those who had similarly
qualified for the higher < honor. The
election that precedes its final 5 attain
ment is such in name only." The choice
is invariably determined, by seniority.
The electors are not the ordinary rate
paying citizens,' who would,' if given the
chance, be 'guided -by their own" Judg
ment-as.to the fitness of a candidate,
but Freemen-Liverymen, members of
these medieval relics, the City Guilds,
in whose : eyes precedent ' is of all
things most saci'ed. And precedent de
cides for them to whom they shall give
their yotes. There is -never any con
test. .The man gets, the billet who
stands next on the waiting list. â
MERELY 'A FIGUREHEAD.

Mrs. Bailey, besides owning a ranch,
leases land and ; raises profitable . crops
on it. A wonderful "cake" made by
her of fruits grown on her own place
has taken a gold medal and Mrs.
Bailey is proud of it. She ' has.become
famous in the California' colony Â¦ here
because* > of winning - a special medal
through â¢: a unique and Â¦ original idea.
There. are forty-one varieties of fruit
in : this "cake." It : is two feet in di
ameter and a. foot thick. It is really
not a- cake, but Is composed only .of
dried fruits sugared together. Several
gold medals have been taken: by prod
ucts In, the Sacramento Valley exhibit,
but there is' none that will arouse
more pride than the one to be sus
pended from '., Mrs. , Bailey's cake of
fruits, rn addition to ', taking a . first
prize, the "cake" will be accorded the
honor of having 'its photograph put in
the official book of the fair. Â¦
Mrs.' Bailey has on exhibition some
cotton grown from seed she obtained
from Georgia last April.
PRIZE . WINNING CAKE.
"Also good, but doesn't carry as much
sugar as the other," said the Jury, and
they all nodded their heads in .wise ap
proval of each other as they smacked
their lips. ;
"And this?" and a third jar of the
same size was " taken down by Mrs.
Kennedy. . / .
"A fine pear, but grown in a some
what different soil and given less water
in the month of September than, the
others," said the Jury, expecting Mrs.
Kennedy to gasp at this wonderful ex
hibition of pear knowledge. Â¦ ; ,
all one pear, gentlemen," said
Mrs. Kennedy, ; with a : meekness that
showed- she;', was .'not- remembering the
wisdom of the jury. "It took three jars
to hold it." This was a fact, too.
How many women in America grow
pears one of which will fill three quart
Jars? None outside California. '
Mrs. Hoppin has a ranch of 550 acres
in- Y0I6 County that knows only her
own superipttendency and that 550 acres
makes as much money each year as
any similar area about it farmed by
a man. Mrs. Hoppin is known as an
authority on alfalfa and dairying and
the results she has "obtained ought to
be enough to '- bring every Eastern
farmer to her locality.
These two ladies are .the widows of
the trio. Commissioner Wills is try
ing to get this fact as generally known
In St. Louis as possible! for he wants
to attract all the unmarried farmers
possible to the Sacramento display.
Mrs.! Kennedy Is lenown as a "practi
cal rancher." She is a large landowner
and grows fruit that has some size . to
it. When the horticultural Jury was
floating about looking for good things
it espied a' quart Jar of pears she had
placed in the exhibit made by Yolo.
"Very fine," said the jury, after it
had sampled.
"What do you think of. this variety?"
asked Mrs. Kennedy, taking down an
other jar. â¢-Â¦-Â¦-
The Sacramento Valley holds a
unique position at the fair because of
its three lady commissioners. In hust
ling they keep the -men at the exhibit
jumping to keep up.
Two of : the ladies, are widows and
landowners, who farm their own lands
and look, after .their own business af
fairs. The third 'has- a husband, but
she also has a business head of her own
and farms ..many, acres of leased land.
This attaches additional importance to
them. It also serves as one of the big
gest advertisements for the valley, as
showing what women can do therefor
themselves. The Â»Sacramento Valley
not only gets excellent work out of its
lady commissioners, -but it has in their
experiences a demonstration "of the" ex
cellence of its agricultural conditions.
PEAR TOO BIG FOR JURY.
CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILDING,
WORLD'S FAIR/ ST. LOUIS, Nov. 2.â
The Sacramento -Valley Development
Association' evidently believes .that the
era for the demonstration of woman's
usefulness in the fields usually, occupied
by men is here. It has shown its con
fidence in the ability of the fair sex a*

It was a statement by William Of-

Frank Bell and Palino Prescott were
sweethearts until a mere "tiff" de
veloped into a breach that defied Â¦ the
bridging efforts of mutual friends, and
the twain finally drifted completely
apart. They had ; not . seen each other
for several years until last.. Tuesday
evening, when they unexpectedly met
face to face at the intersection of
Jackson and Kearny streets. Frank
stared and bowed; Palino gasped and
curtsied. . Frank raised his hat and
smiled: Palino returned the smile. A
moment later they were amiably con
versing.
In the court of Judge Mogan yester
day Palino testified that -never in all
her born days had she ', witnessed a
more complete change of demeanor
than was displayed by Frank when she
informed him that she was a wife. The
information transformed him from a
cooing dove into a roaring, lion, she
declared, and if she did lay. hands upon
him it was Jn effort to quell ' his fren
zied upraidings rather 'than with in
tent to mutilate . his facial cuticle.
Frank, on the other hand, averred
that he was never more astonished in
his life than when Palino assailed him
after he had incidentally remarked
that he was contemplating a marital
union with a young lady whom they
both knew and â¢ admire* - in the old
days. If he did repel Pallno's attack,
his action was purely self-defensive.
Then the policeman who arrested
Frank and Palino testified. that they
were clinched and punching, with free
right hands - when he found ; them and
that both of them hit" in the" com
pulsory breakaway. They *vill re
appear, to-day for sentence.
It was not his fault. John Smith de
clared, that the. horse he was driving
at 5 o'clock p. m. on Market street ex
ceeded the legal .speed limit. He hired
the animal, v.ith buggy attached, at
the Nevada Stables, he said, and so
long as he drove it westward it did
not seem to be particularly eager to
Â¦sprint* No sooner had he reversed the
direction of its head and commenced
the return Journey, however, than it
dashed forward with great gusto and,
tug and pull as he would at the reins,
he could not control its gait. After
hls'srregt and liberation on ball he
made some inquiry into the animal's
record and ascertained that it emulat
ed the tortoise' until its regular dinner
hour drew nigh and it was headed
stableward, when it outfooted the pur
sued hare. Judge Mogan patiently dar
kened to Mr. Smith's plea and prompt
ly dismissed the complaint.
Herman Meyers, arrested for enter
ing and plundering the room of Louis
Petroff at 118*4 Ellis street,
only a cheap pocketknife and thirty
cents as reward of his enterprise. In
his .possession, however, the police
found $50 wrapped in a silk "handker
chief marked "B" and they opine that
he" committed a more remunerative
burglary than that of which Mr. Pet
roff was the victim. Judge Fritz con
tinued the case till to-morrow.
Patrolman Maloney, whose beat is
Union Square, complained that his of
ficial lot would be much happier \t
Jacob Burko, fruit peddler, were com
pelled to keep his horse and wagon in
motion, as prescribed by ordinance. In
stead of doing that Mr. Burko allowed
his horse to occupy one spot until he
saw the policeman approach, when he
hastily attached a "nose bag" to its
head and averred -that he could not
induce it to travel while it was feed
ing. Repeated 'warnings having failed
to persuade him to cease his trickery,
he was arrested and the officer hoped
that Judge Mogan would abstain from
leniency in hi6 case. His Honor re
sponded by fining Mr. Burko $5. ,
Joseph Stokes and Frank Wilson,
charged with assault with a deadly
weapon.' denied that either of them
smashed a bamboo opium pipe on the
head of Joseph Conte, landlord of the
lodging-houee in which they dwelt at
637 California street. The pipe, they
explained, was used by them to prop
up a sagging portion of the mattress
of "their bed and it was fractured by
Mr. Conte casting Mr. Stokes violently
upon the couch. Mr. Conte and his
wife, Leontine, tried to evict the de
fendants and in the scrimmage the
pipe was broken. Judge Fritz reduced
the charge of aEsault with a deadly
weapon to plain battery and remanded
the defendants for sentence.
Three brothers, August, William and
Robert Huber, who came from their
home at Napa to make holiday in the
city, were fiercely battering each other
night before last at Clay and Kearny
streets when Patrolmen McGrane and
Davids separated and arrested them.
Their faces bore Â¦ evidence of the
ferocity of their blows and witnesses
told the policemen that the flght start
ed at California and Kearny streets
and was kept up along the latter thor
oughfare' to the point of arrest. Wil
liam pleaded .that he was acting as
peacemaker between August and Rob
ert, who began quarreling over a "fam
ily affair," but Judge Mogan declined
to discriminate and fined each of the
combatants $5.
â¢ a Â¦â¢
charge him with disturbing the peace,"
said the Judge to. the bailiff, and the
order was instantly obeyed.
A pathetic feature of the proceedings
was the appearance on the V witness
stand of a crippled 10-:'ear-oldÂ» son of
the accused - woman "and one Johnson,
who is serving: a term in San Quentin
for counterfeiting. The unfortunate lit
tle fellow said he knew nothing about
the stabbing of Parker, although he
was in the house at 22 Tehama street
,when it occurred. W. S. Irwin, who
also was there at the time, testified he
did not hear or see Parker and the de
fendant quarrel.
"It is apparent that this man has de
liberately committed perjury to save
the defendant," said the Judge, "and I
regret my inability to hold her for trial
In the Superior Court. She is dis
charged."

The Democratic party does queer things. Only infrequently
docs it 'attract- the sober attention of the 'country. It was moved
upon by wisdom when it nominated Cleveland, for he was a sea
soned politician,, with the qualities of a, statesman. He knew the
public issues of his time and could discuss them in clear, statement.
His opponents found him a foeman with whom combat was a vigor
ous experience. But his predecessor, General Hancock, was .all
that Cleveland was not. His profession of arms had isolated him,
and he had not kept in touch with the public affairs of the country.
No one disliked him personally.' He was an = ideal soldier, as Parker
may be an ideal Judge/. But in the course of the campaign 1 Hancock

T-HE speech of Secretary Hay in- Carnegie Hall, New York, is a
powerful, because reasonable, campaign appeal, that goes to the
substance of things. It is free from invective and may serve
as a missionary effort among Democrats, who feel the lack of any
real issue raised by. their party, and reviews temperately some of
the remarkable statements made i.n Judge Parker's recent speeches
from the porch at Esopus. . â¢ .
One does hot need to attack the character of Judge Parker in
reviewing his* utterances: He has emerged from the judicial chrysalis
to spread his first wing in politics for nearly a quarter of a century.
He takes flight through, a new worlds He has not kept in touch with
events and is compelled to cram in order to have material, for use
in the speeches he must make to visiting clubs and occasional audi

JUDGE' PARKER WOBBLES.
IN the press of other political interests the people of San Francisco
should not lose sight of their opportunity to recast and reform
our whole method of electing a judiciary. For the first time in,
the history of San Francisco the pedple of 'this city have a chance to
lift the judiciary of the State entirely out of partisan politics. It is
a most desirable consummation and the opportunity should not be
lost. Â¦ . ' -V . :
It is believed by the best thinkers that these two major Ameri
can institutions, the public schools and the. judiciary, should be en
tirely separated from partisan control. The education of, the people
and the administration of justice, to be best, must of necessity be
for all, free from influence and bias related to partisan obligations.
To secure this is possible only by r removing such management en
tirely from partisanship. How can this be done except by disregard
ing the party responsibility in election ? By common consent this
has been done here in regard to the judges, for, the first time in a
campaign, and 'if : that consent be carried successfully to the polls in
the election of Judges Murasky, Troutt, Seawell and Kerrigan we
will entirely, and for all the future, eliminate partisanship from the
election of judges. , \ '
When it is done here it will spread over the State. There seems
now no doubt that the people , will ratify the - constitutional :^ amend
ment for an appellate court, intermediate between the Superior and
Supreme courts. The men who sit, in the new tribunal must be the
flower of the legal profession. ; It must be a bench free from partisan
attachment or obligation. If we elect the-four incumbent judges ir.
this city next Tuesday, we- will? have -.made efficient preparation for
the choice of the best possible appellate bench.
The interests, the policy and the sentftnent at 'stake, are too
vastly important to be â¢ lightly overlooked/ and it should be a matter
of pride with every citizen to help a movement so great in its promise
of public benefit, by voting for Judges Murasky, Troutt, Seawell arid
Kerrigan.

â¢When-.such a person rises to rebuke an- upright man like Mr.
Hayes, and to pursue him with a sandstorm of lies and detraction,
it is time for decent, people to take counsel' together and consider
their dirty. When the Fifth California District gets its orders from
the tenderloin district of New York City it will be time for de
cency to go into a corner and die. When the pigsty of politics im
poses its smell and smirch upon a campaign in California it is time
to take defensive .measures. â¢ â¢
We make, no a'pology for our treatment of tliese creatures.
Filth is not. less filthy by; calling if "matter out of place." By filth
it is attempted to defeat Mr. Hayes, who- is representative of the
class of men most desirable to enlist in politics, for their knowledge
and their high character. The source of this filth is an affluent foun
tain of all that is vile and repulsive in public and private life, and
any less statement of it would not be a plain statement, which is
what we desire to make.
SINCE his nomination, the Examiner has carried on a vicious,
filthy and false campaign against Mr. E. A. Hayes, Republican
no.minee for- Congress, in the Fifth District. Mr. Hayes lives
in Sail J<?se, and has been identified with reform in politics and polit
ical methods! .He has been and is a leader in all things that make for
decency. No honest man has ever questioned his sincerity and all
men know his ability and his superb fitness to represent his district
in Congress. â¢ He is an able, upright man. .Because in San Jose there
are the vsual manifestations of human folly and vice common to
cities, and froin which none are exempt, Mr. Hearst accuses Mr.
Hayes, of responsibility for their existence. Mr. Hayes needs no de
fense. But whp is His accuser? 'Who and what is Hearst that he
*may accuse other men? . He represents in Congress the sink-hole
'district of Ne\v York City. He is one of the stenches that rise from
the cesspool of the filth and vice. of the darkest part of New York.
Wherever he has lived Jie has. left behind a 'trail of transgression.
. His path may be traced by the muck left by his feet wherever they
have touched the earth. He has corrupted politics, journalism and
social life. His career sweats disregard of the code of morals, and
the example be has set before others leads hellward for such as
follow it. ' /.â¢Â¦ Â¦- 'â¢Â¦Â¦ ';â¢_
THE ATTACKS ON HAYES.

Haiman had a gasoline "jag." He
was brought to the hospital In a like
condition last Friday and Sunday.. The
police say he Is a confirmed gasoline

ped mentally, nor by experience, for the office of President, that
business men became alarmed and without regard to party combined
and defeated him.
Judge Parker is going the same pace. While he confined him
self to abstractions he was tolerable. But recently he has stepped
off speculative ground and has been making speeches which dis :
close a mind unfitted for the executive duties and responsibilities
which a President must discharge. His discussion of fiscal matters
and of public finances show him' profoundly unlearned and amaz
ingly credulous as to pie management of the finances of the Gov
ernment. He is incapable of grasping such questions. Perhaps.it
is this inability to comprehend a fiscal question that led him to twice
support Mr. Bryan's wild p6ints of finance.
Secretary Hay points out Judge Parker's equally wild expres
sions about the Philippines, in which he undershoots and overshoots
with a recklessness that would scatter the bystanders if he were
handling a gun with equal recklessness. The people do not want
a credulous and wondering man for President, no matter how amiable
he may be. The Judge seems to be that kind of person and reveals
himself in the Esopus oratory that he is using in the closing days
of the campaign.
Since he has made these wobbly speeches there has evidently
been a new alignment in New York that has ended all doubt about
President Roosevelt carrying the State. Going to the betting as an
indication, after each of the Judge's speeches his backing declines.
The professional bettors are not moved by any impulse. They are
perfectly cold-blooded. Many of them in New York City are Demo
crats, but they are also professional students of chance and put up
the odds with a perfectly cold heart, as far as partisanship is con
cerned.
The business men are equally indifferent to party politics when
the issue is between a man who is expert -as an executive with a
level head and knowledge of public affairs, and one who seems
to combine a stolid and a credulous quality of mind. that would make
him an unsafe man in the office which he seeks. jThe judgment of
business men beat Hancock, with all his deserved military honors
upon him, and the same unerring judgment will defeat Judge Parker.

The facts as made public now, from a variety of sources in

alliance with -Rockefeller. But no Republican nor' independent
voter; is the least shaken by this situation. The faith of the Presi
dent is in the people and the faith of the people is in the President.
In this mutuality of interest there is an alliance stronger than could

â¢" â¢ No one deiues'Mr. Rockefeller's right to favor whom he pleases
fof .the Presidency, and no one denies the subtlety of the Standard
OH trust in the use of money for political purposes. A majority of
the people, however, doubt the power of money to buy a Presiden
tial election. It. has never been done in this country, and probably
will never be- ddne. It is known of all men, however, that the
Standard Oil Company has supreme faith in the power of money to
do anything, and this faith accounts for its attempt to offset by
money the public lack of confidence in the Democratic party, and the
cras.s blunders -of Jtidge Parker. :;>/
The* alliance of Rockefeller and Democracy is nefarious, for the
reason that the party he is trying to reinstate in power has gained
what little popularity it has by denouncing the methods he is em
ploying" in its behalf. This implies a vast and vicious system of
false pretenses which must appall the thoughtful citizen. President
Roosevelt put the matter just as the people see it when he said that
he dia not wish any one. connected with Standard Oil to contribute
to his campaign, and declared that-any proposition from that source
to" contribute to. the Democrats . in Democratic States and to the
Republicans m Republican States was also vicious, for no contribu
tions, should be made .to either. ' From the beginning of the cam
paign" the' activity- of Standard Oil against the President has been
apparent. 'I Judge Parker's campaign in New York was opened by
.Senator- Bailey, who is believed by many to be a Standard man.
t-jORMERLY the oscillating quantity in campaigns was repre-
M serited by the Vanderbilts, then by Jay Gould, who testified that
I- in "Democratic -districts he was a Democrat and in Republican
districts a Republican. Now this pendulum sort of politics is rep
resented by Mr. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil trust.
Long before the nominations were made this year, it was made
evident by signs known to politicians that Mr. Rockefeller had
joined forces with J. J. Hill and other enemies of 'President Roose
velt to defeat him. The Republican National Convention was in the
hands of the people and nothing* could be done there. The fight, .a
.powerful and secret one, had to be made against the President as a
candidate, and must continue to the polls. The President secured
"himself agamst. treachery, by putting Mr. Cortelyou at the head of
the National Committee, and his campaign has been made open and
aboveboard. His support has come from the legitimate business
nieuiof the country, .allied with all the common interests of the peo
ple, iu'poh which he relies for the victory he is sure to win next

If you have leisure time during the
next six weeks make two or three
dainty slips fastened down the back of
muslin or China silk for house wear
next winter. If you are subject to colds
male them with high neck and long
sleeves and wear under them a Shet
land wool corset cover and petticoat.
Dozens of women use silk pongee,
which is durable and has a little body
in it. [.:':Â¦
The necessity of having a taffeta lin
ing for a thin house frock has gone.
In truth, it looks rather heavy and stiff
by the side of the exquisite linings of
China and Japanese silk.
The women who can afford only one
such lining make this up into a slip,
with blouse and skirt gathered at one
belt and fastened down back, cut either
high or low.
There Is still another class of women
who do not wish to afford even a slip
of China silk, and they should be de
lighted to know that they are equally In
fashion by wearing a smartly made and
trimmed corset cover and petticoat of
white muslin.
All of these fashionable edicts make
the house wardrobes for the average
woman a much easier problem than It
has been for years.
Remember that thin fabrics are
cheaper now than ever: that there Is no
reason to believe the styles In them will
change for â¢ this winter; that flowered
and colored fabrics are more fashion
able than white, and that white cotton
net will be elaborately used next sea
son, .run through with silver or gold
threads, trimmed In blonde lace and
sometimes touched with polka dots of
colored floss. SihB
Thousands of women cannot afford
silk linings for anything. Other thou
sands are delighted that they don't
have to afford taffeta at a dollar a
yard except for the handsomest frock,
says the Pittsburg Press.
All in one with the reformation from
heavy clothes Is the abandoning of taf
fetas for linings. * except where velvet
arid elegant cl6ths are concerned." Lib
erty satin has been substituted for
evening gowns and china silk for house
wear.
A curious defense was put forward
in Paris the other day by a lawyer
when pleading for his client, a young
and aristocratic looking lady named
Madame Deline, a confirmed klepto
maniac, who was put on her trial for
the theft of a remnant of silk from
one of the large Paris drapery shops.
The prisoner had been condemned on
ten previous .occasions for similar of
fenses. Her counsel pointed out that
she had never stolen anything but
silk. The touch of this material, he
explained, produced a singular sensa
tion of fascination which Madame Dc-
Hne found it impossible to resist. The
truth of this, he continued, was borne
out by medical evidence and recognized
by the magistrate before whom she
was brought on the last occasion, who.
in spite of her previous convictions,
fined her only one franc The further
hearing of the case was postponed In
order that the woman's mental condi
tion might be inquired into.

It was while engaged in breaking into
one of these devices last night that
young Salzmann was caught. He was
detected and captured by George
Adams, one of the clerks. The little
fellow kicked and fought for his liberty
like any adult crook would have done.
He had his pockets Jammed with the
coveted coppers. The other youngsters
made good their escape.
The youthful "burglar" was turned
over: to Policeman Hennebery and
taken to the Central station. When
questioned by Lieutenant Green Willie
admitted that he and "the gang" had
been stealing for weeks past from the
penny parlors. He denies that he ever
was allowed to keep any of the money,
but was made to turn it over to his
teachers, one of whom was a girl. He
does not know what she did with the
ponnles. He says that the other boys
used to give him a few pennies to pur
chase candy with, and then took the
rest home to their mothers, saying to
the parents that they found the coins.
The proprietors of themusee have
been annoyed by small thefts for some
time. Gum machines have been stolen
and brazen robberies committed In the
presence of a house full of persons.
On account v of the extreme youth of
Salzmann the charge against him was
reduced from burglary to petty lar
ceny. He was later bailed out by his
father, who feels keenly his small son's
position. The police have good descrip
tions of the other boys and the little
girl, and expect soon to arrest them.
Dickens' characters in his book, "Oli
ver Twist," the "Artful Dodger" and
Charley Bates, had but one preceptor,
Fagin. Little Salzmann says that he
was trained to steal by four other small
boys and a little sirl, whose names, he
alleges, he does not know. For weeks
past the gang has stolen more than $100
from the machines. The little thieves
open the lock boxes with keys when the
place is crowded and extract all the
pennies they can carry-
An 8-year-old boy, one of a gang of

Peter Salzmann, a baker residing at 1
Kent street. The little fellow, whose

SET. WHO WAS GUEST OF HONOR AT LUNCHEON GIVEN YESTERDAY
BY RAPHAEL WEILL AT THE BOHEMIAN CLUB.
The secretary of state soon enlight
fned the astonished father, who, not
withstanding his great modestv, was
oblfged to end by accepting the position
of apoFlclic delegate to the Philippines.
ROME, Nov. 2. â Father Ambrose
Agius was recently appointed papal
delegate to the Philippines. He has led
a busy, varied life* in which he has
learned to take a broad view of persons
and things. He was born in Egypt on
September 17, 1S56. but was educated in
England, where he took the habit of
the Benedictines at Ramsgate in 1871,
taking his ,next degree at Sublaco, in
Italy, where is the chief house of the
Benedictines. This. degree was conferred
by Cardinal Monaco La Valletta, .who
climbed to the Holy Speco, which all
travelers know, to celebrate the inter
esting symbolic function.
Some time afterward Father Ambrose,
together with the two brothers Serafiri,
also Benedictines, founded a house of
their order at Malta, and as they had
neither money, position nor influence
lived there as real hermits. The holy
work, however, seems to have blessed
them, as they have all risen to. high,
positions in the church. One Seraflni is
apostolic delegate' In Mexico and thu
ether general of the BenedictlnÂ»3.
. A- few months ago Father Agius had
to go to England, and Pope Pius X in
taking leave of him said, "We will meet
again soon," and. In fact, two months
later. Just as Agius was about to board
a shlo to go to America, he received a
telegram from Cardinal Merry del Val
saying, "Drop even* engagement and
come to Rome."
Wondering and mystified, he arrived
in the Eternal City and immediately
asked an audience of the Pope. The
Pope met him smiling and said, "I con
gratulate.you most sincerely," and see
ing Agius' look of bewilderment adde-J
laughing. "I will not tell you what for;
I wish to leave that pleasure to his Em
inence Cardinal Merry del Val. Go to
him."
The room of Philip . Hinkle, 435
Eush street, was entered early yester
day morning while he was absent for
a few minutes and his gold watch,
valued at $90 was stolen. He observed
J. B. Cannon, another lodger, crossing
the hallway from his room as he was
returning. He notified Policeman. Max
Fenner, who found the watch In a
lot adjoining the . house underneath
Hinkle's window. â¢ Fenner arrested
Cannon and Henry Daley, his room*
mate, and locked them in "the ta*W
pending further Investigation.

A Week of wedded life for Willianr
and Nellie Baeorrie was ended by the
Eudden and unexplained desertion by
the bride, and the husband now seeks
a divorce. Bacome complains that
they were' married on August 31 last
and one night a week later he came
home and found the house deserted.
His wife had taken his five-year-old
son with her and when he located
them she declined to return, although
he offered to take her home in a hack.
He now says that she had ulterior mo
tives in marrying him.
Eva Frances Frodsham wants a di
vorce from her husband, William
Frodsham, because of his cruelty,
which, she says, consisted of threat
ening her life, choking her, whipping
her with a cat-o'-nine-talls, throwing
a loaf of bread at her and slapping
her with a folded newspaper.
Other suits for divorce were filed
by Benson E. Lee against Sarah M.
Lee, desertion; Yetta Glassman
against Louis Glassman, desertion;
Lola de Luca against Alfonso de Luca,
cruelty; Palma C. Parkin against S.
H. Parkin, desertion and neglect;
Lucy Hadley Kelsey against Nicholas
E. Kelsey, neglect; Walter S. Johnson

James A. O'Brien for cruelty.
Italo A. Calpestri, a clerk for Fu
gazi & Co.. says he was a banker In
Genoa, Italy, but was driven from
home and business by the cruelty of
his wife. Bendetta. Yesterday, through
his attorneys, Soderberg &. Walsh, he
filed a suit for divorce. In the land
of sunny skies they were married in
1888, and a daughter, now five years
old, was born, to them. It is said that
In June. 1902, the wife scratched her
husband's face and "threatened other
wrongs." In August following, be
cause of her circulation of false
charges against him, he was com
pelled to abandon his business and
leave for the United States.
Lucille Schmoll, who on May 17
sued her husband, George Schmoll,
for $160 a month separate mainte
nance, yesterday dimissed the action
and sued him for divorce on the
ground of cruelty. They were married
at Reno in April of last year and she
Eaid his abuse began a month later.
In a cross-complaint to her former
suit Schmoll accused his wife of fre-
Quentlng dance halls.
The demand of Lucy Loupy for
$100 a month pending the trial of her
suit for divorce against Jean Loupy,
one of the proprietors of the Pup ro
tisserie, is resisted by the . defendant,
who -filed an affidavit yesterday de
claring the restaurant to be worth
only $30,000, Instead of $50,000, and
its income $150 a month, instead of
$2000, as alleged by the wife. He
also says that the fittings are mort
gaged for $9000 and the indebtedness
of himself and partner is $19,155. He
says Mrs. Loupy owns $8000 worth of
realty, with an income of $81 a
month.

PERSOXAIi.
"Yes, it Is true -that two members of
the Grand Jury have been approached
within the past twenty-four hours,"
said Foreman Lilienfeld last, evening.
"We know positively that the men who
tried to intercede in behalf of the com
missioners came as the representatives
of the administration. .That is all I
care to say of the matter."
The foreman made this statement on
information furnished him by the two
jurors in question.
"There is no use of their trying to
Influence me," declared Esberg. "I am
on record as voting to take steps
against the Board of Election Commis
sioners and I shall vote that way every
time the matter comes up. I believe
that the commissioners were guilty of
malfeasance in their failure to comply
with the requirements of law in ap
pointing precinct boards for the nÂ»
cent primaries and that they deserve
to be ousted from office. They may as
well talk to the Rock of Gibraltar as
talk to me about changing my attitude
la â¢Â¦ the matter." - _. >â. . .
It Is said that the efforts to in
fluence Jungblut have been carried so
far as the making of threats against
his business interests.
Matthew I, O'Brien, one of the nine
Jurors who saved the commission at
the last session when the vote was a tie,
has gone East , on a business trip.
Wakefield Baker^ is expected to be on
hand ! to-day, arid if all the members
attend a vote of ten to eight is looked
for. According to the advice of As
sistant District Attorney Whiting
twelve votes are not required for an
accusation to remove from office, as
for the finding of an indictment. .
The Grand Jury will probably also
devote its attention to a report that
an attempt hasVbeen made to exert im
proper influence on two of its members-
Milton H. Esberg and Otto Jungblutâ
to induce them not to vote for the pros
ecution of the Election Commissioners.
Two men called on Jungblut yester
day and sought to have him promise
that he would either vote against ac
cusing the board of malfeasance or
would remain away from the meeting,
so that a majority vote could not be
obtained.' The same men called on Es
berg, but he refused to see them, in
asmuch, as they announced that they
wished to see him on business connect
ed with the Grand Jury.
Esberg is treasurer of the Mose Gunst
Company. ' The visitors came to his
office in the Kearny street store. Jung
blut is associated with his father in
the billiard table manufacturing busi
ness.
Another effort will be made at the
meeting of the Grand Jury this after
noon to present an accusation against
the Election j Commissioners in an en
deavdr to have \ them removed ' from
office. Those urging prosecution of
the board believe they will have a
majority' and. that they will finally be
successful.

geles took the first game of the final
series against Tacoma. The two
teams are nearly tied for , first place.
The score was 10 to 6. and the game
was won by the locals in the eighth

batting rallies ever seen on the local
grounds. Overall had the locals com
pletely puzzled up to the eighth, while
Oscar Jones of Brooklyn proved. easy
for Tacoma. He retired in favor of
Mason, Morley's new pitcher from
Baltimore, at the end of the third in
ning. In the eighth inning Chance
started a batting rally and before the
third man was put out Overall had
been touched for two doubles, three
singles, made a wild pitch and given
a base on balls. These, together with
two errors by the infield, netted the
locals eight runs.
Mason, pitched a steady game.
Chance's work behind the bat was a
feature. Attendance 3000. Score:

Wheeler's wildness let in a run in
the first. The Brownies came up in
the third and broke It all up in jig
time. Three errors in succession, a
couple of walks and- a measley hit
sandwiched in resulted in three runs.
The game was bad enough up to this
time, but after that it was awful and
dragged along in a senseless sort of
way for six innings more. The score:
The two tramp baseball teams, San
Francisco and Portland, began the
most agonizing: and meaningless series
of, the year. yesterday afternoon at the
Eighth-street lot. - A - forlorn looking
bunch of? fans sat: gloomily on the
bleachers while the Brownies profited
by the fearful baseball of the Seals
and won.; 5 to 2.
If^ever there was a bad ball game
this was it. No life, no ginger, no
fast play and nobody cared. The
game had to be played and the play
ers had to play it, otherwise they
would not collect their salaries on
pay day. Had there been a chance to
be in some other, place it is a 100 to 1
bet the stars would not show up.
Wheeler, who was do!ng the twist
ing for the Seals, could not get the
ball over the plate and when he did
toss up a good one his fielders were
unable to check its speed even when
it came right into their mitts. Port
land fielded in good form, Frary be
ing the only man to make an error.
Runklp, at short, pulled off a few phe
nomenal plays, as did little Spencer,
who was doing the honors at second.

The Commuters are after that base
ball rag and it will take a big league
aggregation to stop them. After.mak
! ing monkeys out of the heretofore in
vincible Tigers for the last two weeks,
they started in on the Siwashes yester
i day. on Ewing's own battleground at
! Idora Park, Oakland, and punched
holes through the infield and. the out
field. They were never headed and gal
loped home with the coin. Score 4 to 1.
"Pretzel" Schmidt handed the slug
gers of Seattle town a bunch that they
1 .were not used to. He had them all
breaking their necks after that drop
ball, but that was all they could do
with It. One run was eased over on a
wild pitch and a double bag. shot by
Delmas. After that it was Oakland in
every round. The three leaders are
bunched at the top of the list and
the prettiest race In years is on with a
vengeance.
Oakland got down to business In the
first inning and with Ganley out
Francks came through with a hit. but
was forced at second by Dunleavy.
Dunleavy stole second, went to third
on an error by Delmas and scored on a
passed ball.
Another run came through In the
fourth inning when Streib hit what
would have been a two-baser down into
left field. The ball got lost In the
grass amd he made third. Devereaux
rapped along one out to center field and
streib had plenty of time to score, but
Delehanty tripped htm up. McDonald
saw the work, and motioned Streib to
come in. Not a Â»sihgle Seattle man
kicked and Oakland got its second run.
Seattle scored its only run in the
seventh when R. Hall was hit by the
pitcher. He went to third on a two
base hit by Delmas and scored on- Van
Haltren's long fly.
Oakland cinched the game in the
eighth when, with one out, Kruger was
safe on an error by Delmas. He went
to third on Streib's hit, while Streib
got to second on the throw-in. Dev
ereaux scored them both by a line drive
over first base, one of the prettiest hits
of the season. The score:
Seattle â Oakland â

touchdowns against the second team.
Shields and Bansbach did not play with
the varsity eleven. Several of the best

was the lucky winner | of " the second
race/ He was not the best horse by
any. means, for the favorite, NamfDr,
was hemmed in all around the far turn.
His backers were a sore lot of losers,
for, judging by the manner | in which
he closed through the last furlong,

than, the usual number of- prominent
Vacing men were present to-flay. There
were > only four starters in the stake,
yet they made a lot of trouble at. the
post. When the barrier.; was released
Dandelion * was well in his stride, â¢ Davis
being in ther act of walking him up
when the signal wasgiven. This made
little or no difference in .the result, as
Dandelion had plenty â¢ of speed and
opened up a. gap on both Gamara and
Pasadena. . This gap was gradually re-,
duced so that the onlookers concluded
that Dandelion was well served by the
shorter distance of five and a half fur

In July, 1S83, 1 began to break out trith
Eczema on ny head, legs and arms, and
began treatment with local doctors, but
did not get much relief. They said the dis-
ease had become chronic I then quit them
and tried various ointments' and soaps for
another two rears, but as soon as cold
weather came I was as bad off as ever, so I
finally decided to let medicine alone, and
' for twelve or thirteen years did nothing
towards curing the Eczema, except bath-
ing. This seemed to do about as much
good as anything I had tried. : t " . Â¦'Â¦". v
During the time I lost about one-half of
tny hair. I began S. S. S. doubtful of a
cure, because the disease had run so long,
but soon discovered your medidne.was
doing me good, and continued to take it.
I used seven bottles,- when I was. com-
pletely cured; not having a single spot on
my body, which before was almost com-
pletely covered. F. C. Norfolk.

The head, feet, and hands are usually
the parts affected, though the disease ap-
pears on other parts of the body. While ex- .
ternd applications allay the itching and j
burning temporarily, it is the acids thrown
off by theblood that cause the irritation
and eruptions upon the skin. The acids
must be neutralized and the system cleans-
ed of all humors and poisons before the

General Arthur MacArthur, TJ. S. A.,
commander of the Division of the Pa
cific, accompanied by Police Commis
sioners Howell, Hutton, Drinkhoiise
and Reagan, waited on Mayor Schmitz
yesterday afternoon for ; the purpose
of urging the closing of the saloons in
the vicinity of the Presidio.
It was explained that the saloons
ere operating without a municipal li
cense, which was refused by the for
mer Police Commission, owing to the
frequent complaints of riotous con
duct in the saloons. The present Po
lice Commission had also refused to
isyue liquor licenses to the saloons.
General MacArthur pleaded for the
closing of the saloons, which he said
were detrimental to the tnorab of
the soldiers. The Police Commission
ers and the Mayor agreed with Mac-
Arthur that the saloons -should be
c!osed. but the conference ended with
out any conclusion as to definite action
being arrived at.

The trial of Harry Radcliffe for mur
der in Judge Cook's court was stopped
yesterday morning by the receipt of a
telegram from George I* Claytor,
Boulsbyville, Tuolumne County, that he
could not come to the trial. The tele
gram was handed to Assistant District
Attorney Ashe just after the Jury had
been Impaneled.- . ' ;
Ashe read the telegram to the Judge
and cald, "This man Claytor is the
principal witness for the State, and I
am unable to proceed without him. He
was regularly served with a foreign
subpena." Â¦:Â¦ " : s -"Â¦' Â«
The Judge ordered an attachment is
sued against Claytor, to be placed In
the hands of a deputy sheriff, who was
instructed to leave by the first train
for Soulsbyville and bring Claytor
back with him. The case was then con
tinued till this morning.
Radclifle Is accused of murdering An
drew Rellly, a nodcarrier, at Ninth and
Folsom streets on the morning of June
26. Radcliffe made a statement when
arrested that his young wife had been
eick and he took her to Dr. J. J. Keefe,
his half-brother, living at 1306 Folsom
street. He left her on the corner, -and
after she had walked along Folsom
street a few yards she screamed and
came running back. She told him that
a man had insulted her. Radcliffe went
up to the man, who was Reilly, and
Reilly struck him. They grappled and
fell, and as Radcliffe was getting the
worst of the encounter he fired a shot
at Reilly. .
This statement was doubted when
Mrs. Reilly said she had not gone with
her husband to" Dr. Keefe. and , as a
mask was found in Radcllffe's pocket
the police accepted the theory that
Radcliffe. being out of work, had at
tempted to hold up Reilly. Claytor was
driving a milk wagon. He heard the
shot and .saw the defendant running
away.

CHICAGO. Nov. , 2.-Reassurlng advices re
garding Anglo-Russian affairs and lower prices
Jn foreign markets were the main cause of con
siderable nelling of wheat here .when trading
began. Opening quotations on both the De
cembor and May deliveries showed losses the
former being off %Â©%. at $1 n tt^ 11%? Ma?
was down SÂ®4 to H&%, at $1 11)4Â©1 uu,
Bearish sentiment, however, survived only a
brief period. News from the Southwest was
extremely bullish, numerous reports of dam
age by Hessian files and drought being re
ceived from various .sections of the winter
wheat belt. 8oras of the messages from Kan
sas were radical, declaring that the condition
of- tbe growing crop Is the .worst ever ex
perltnced ln Ihat region. In addition to the
poor showing claimed for the new crop the
movement or wheat from the farms continued
to diminish in volume. Arrivals in the North
west to-day were considerably less than last
year, while the total primary receipts were
about 20 per cent smaller than those of tha
corresponding day a year ago.
From the start shorts wer- active buyers De
cember steadily advanced until it reached
*I 134 and May reached $1 12%. Sentiment in
the pit then suddenly shifted to the bear side
During- llw latter part or the session tradinc
showed less animation, and the market lost al
most all of the early advance. The cause of
the Changs ln sentiment waa ' a report of Â¦ a
local crop statistician,* stating that the condi
tion Of winter wheat In Ohio. Indiana, Illinois
Missouri and Kansas is | not so bad as a year
ago. . The market closed barely steady and
practically unchanged, with December at
SI 124 anJ May at $1 U!,Q>1 12.
In corn trading was mostly local. December
closed Ue lower at 489Â»'g4S4c. . , -.--
Oats were dull. December clewed unchanged

Provisions were strong from start to finish
Buytns; by a big packer caused an early ad
vance and covering by shorts later In the ses
sion lifted prices still higher. Tbe market was
helped by a small run of hogs at the yards. At
the close January pork was up 20c,* lard ud 5Â®

"Market opened lower, tn sympathy with
Liverpool cables, but received support from
continued reports of droughty condition
through winter wheat regions and Heasian fly.
BroomhaU'* cable, reporting rumor, of duty to
be taken oft* by Spain on wheat early In 1905.
possibly added to early strength. Strength in
July option frightened the shorts into cover
ing causing a sudden bulge."
In this market futures were weak and quiet,
with more liquidation in December. The cash
grain was unchanged.
WHEAT â Liverpool futures were lower.
Chicago was erratic, declining from $1 12%
to (1 11% recovering to $1 l."!i and falling
back to %\ 12%. The war scare was con
sidered over, but decreasing receipts and in
creasing reports of damage by Hessian â¢ fly
caused a strong tone.

ThÂ« earnings of the Steel Trust for the last

tvhile there has been a most satisfactory lm

consignments. Because of the unsatisfactory
condition of affairs most holders of hay. hare
announced their Intention to reduce their ship
ments, which will probably result in "an Im
proved market within the near future.. Almost
every one still predicts an open winter, which
in Itself does- not tend to strengthen the situ
ation any. â¢-â¢â¢â¢â¢ .
"During the past week some little attention
has been given our market by the Oregon
dealers, it having been reported that the hay
crop of that State is very short. There la
some possibility, therefore, of shipments being
made that way before 'the end of the season.
Should this come about we may yet have a
very Interesting market here, especially If
Southern California continues to draw on us.
"The better grades of Wheat Hay_are very
much In- evidence Just at present, with .the
result that the market on this especial grade
Is very soft, whereas the medium grades are
holding their own much better. Some.dam
aged shipments are still being made and- are
going at low- prices. "Other kinds show no
material change from the quotations given
during the last two weeks."

the judgment of the Superior Court.
He- was codefendant with the West

instituted by ' . the Home Savings

was overruled and .Kelsey appealed

To satisfy Flexner's suspicions Lake
showed what purported; to be Jensen's
indorsement on the back of the check.
Fiexner is a depositor with the West
ern National ; Bank and he went
with Lake to , the bank and indorsed
the check as a guarantee that it was
all right, the amount V was paid to
Lake. In view of Flexner's guarantee
the bank cashed other checks for Lake
which had been signed by Trost to be
paid to customers, aggregating about
$1000. .
When the. checks went through the
clearing-house and Trost : was â¢ notified
the Â¦ forgeries^were discovered, Flexner
explained his share in - the transaction.
Lake is a" married .man and lives'on
Page street.' It Is thought that he is
hiding in the city.

of L. Jensen to^'an I indorsement on- a

Auditor Baehr yesterday filed with
the Mayor and Board of Supervisors his
annual report showing in detail the fin
ancial transactions of the city for 1903
1904. In a communication Baehr calls
attention to the different form of the
report from those heretofore rendered.
Baehr says:
By â¢ the accompanying report the severaJ
Stems of the budget are no arranged as to
thow the purposes lor which they were raised
and the actual disposition of the moneys so
rateed. Thtre is also a summary of expendi
ture* showing the total cost or the municipal
administration for the fiscal year. It is mani
festly impossible for me to close, my books for
the year until all demands are presented and
disposed of. Many demands have been held
back beyond the end of the year for various
reason*-, h^nee the lateness of this report. If
sornt plan could be devised to call in outstand
ing: claims before the end of the year the finan
cial accounts of my department would be much
timplifled end my report presented on time.
The following is the general summary
of the disbursement of funds:
The committee decided to inspect
personally the proposed route of a spur
track along Second, King, Brannan
and â¢Townsend streets this afternoon,
petition for the same having been filed
by C. N. Felton, and the Draymen's
Association having objected to its
being granted. *
The committee reported in favor of
the recommendation of the Board of
Works that Fourth street, between
Market and . Howard, be -repaved and
widened at a cost of $17,500, and ordered
the preparation of an ordinance for
doing the work, - which will â¢ be passed
to print next Monday. , â¢; /
The : work of repaving H street from
Seventh to Twentieth avenues at a
cost of $35,000 was â¢ also ordered. The
contract for the work . had already
been awarded to the F. M. Yorke Com
pany, but was rescinded, because the
consent of the Supervisors had not been
obtained. The sidewalks on ' H street
were also ordered abolished as it is in
tended to bituminize it to the park
line. ' ' ' " .
Similar action, was taken on the
amended ordinance prohibiting the dis
tribution of handbills so that it will
apply only to' indecent literature.
During the discussion reference was
made to the recommendation of ex-
City Engineer Grunsky that Sixteenth
street be widened, but Captain Payson
proved that this recommendation was
subject to the grant of a right of way
on Sixteenth streettp the Western Pa
citlc' Company,' whose petition is with
the Board of Works f or- a. report. It
was stated that the 'surrounding prop
erty will be benefited -and the company
had agreed to install every improve
ment for smooth and level streets.-
The committee postponed' for one
week consideration of the proposed or
dinance submitted by Livingston Jenks
mailing- it unlawful for any. person op
erating an automobile to drain oil from
a machine upon the street.
The committee recommended the pas
sage .to print of the ordinance grant
ing the franchise and fixed November
30 as the ; day 'for hearing claims" for
damages.
D. S. O'Brien and M. Robinson, rep
resenting several protesting property
owners along the route of the road,
pleaded for, a continuance for one week
In order that their clients might be en
abled to present their claims for dam
ages. Captain A. H. Payson, assistant
to president of the Santa Fe Company,
objected to a continuance and held that
the committee should protect his com
pany from possible extortion. Payson
said that it was costing the company
$30,000 to eliminate Mariposa street
from the proposed line in order to meet
the protests of property owners af
fected.
The Supervisors Street Committee
yesterday considered the petition of the
Santa Fe Railway system for a fran
chise for a right of way along Fif
teenth, Eighth. Sixteenth and Seven
teenth streets, thence through private
property to a point near Indiana and
Eighteenth streets.
Detectives O'Dea and Mulcahy visit
ed the Berkeley home of Otto Boedick
ker, a discharged employe of. Mack &
Co., wholesale druggists, yesterday and
succeeded in recovering about $600
worth of goods which the former em
ploye had stolen from the firm. Boed
ickker, who Is under ' arrest, was . a
partner in crime of Joseph Sturm, who
is held by the police on a larceny
charge. -He was taken into custody
last Friday while disposing of the drug
company's In his room in Ala
meda'JlOO wor.th of loot was found.'
Both Boedickker and Sturm will ; be
formally arraigned to-day. *
Boedickker : was discharged from
Mack & Co.'s employ about four weeks
ago. He says his dismissal was for no
other reason than that his father, had
once , been suspected of robbing a place
in Oakland. When he received his two
weeks' notice, he was so angered at
the action of his employers that he de
termined to secure vengeance .by help
ing himself to their wares. Sturm be
came his partner; and in two weeks'
time the pair succeeded in carrying
out about $800 worth of goods, which
they took to their -respective homes.
Detectives O'Dea and Mulcahy
caught Sturm, who is also a former
employe of- Mack & Co., in the. act of
disposing of so: e of the loot on Kearny
street last Friday night and arrested
him. "When closely questioned, he im
plicated Boedickker- and said that he
had left the employ of the drug house
that he might be out of temptation's
way. At the time of his. arrest he was
working for an insurance .company.
The , detectives found" Boedickker-r'and
placed: him in the" "tanks" on Tuesday.
Yesterday they visited his | room and
were rewarded by recovering most of
the stolen property.- Articles of . every
description, such as are handled by:a
drug company, , were recovered. â¢ The
collection in value: aggregated $600.
There were toilet ,' articles, cutlery,
cologne, batteries and drugs of high
value. Boedickker only awaited an op
portunity to dispose of them.
The joint Committee on Charter
Amendments, Public Utilities and
Finance will meet this afternoon to
consider Lunstedt's proposed resolu
tion calling a* special election on Jan
uary 5 next for the " submission of
charter amendments: affecting the ad
ministration of the Public School De
partment. The resolution provides
that, the sum of $12,000 shall be
drawn for the purpose from the ur
gent necessity fund.
The Democratic Supervisors are
disinclined 'to submit the amendments,
notwithstanding that the petitions re
questing their submission were signed
by a number of persons largely in ex
cess of the 15 per cent of the qualified
voters, as the constitution provides.
They- take the ground that there* are
no available- funds . for . the special
election and the urgent necessity fund
should . not be ' used for the purpose.
One of the reasons assigned for de
laying immediate' consideration of the
resolution last Monday was to ascer
tain from the Election Commission
whether it' has any funds to hold a
special election.
The committee will also consider
the other twenty-two amendments
which the Supreme Court decided
could not be submitted on November
8 nex.t.
Supervisors Will Decide To-Day
1 Whether Charter Changes Will Be
Submitted to Voters.

A question that Attorney PJllsbury
laid much stress on was whether the
talesmen Knew Louis Metzgery who is
in the lottery business, or any other
person who was giving financial sup
port of the contestant in promoting
this suit.* '
â¢'We do not know.Metzger," declared
Attorney- Hiram Johnson. .. ;;;': ;
Pillsbury also . made it appear that
Wilson . & i Wilson, i attorneys for Mrs.
J. Li. Moody, who was an aunt of Miss
Dolbeer. are giving aid to the contest
ant. But Johnson also denied this. The
report that Mrs." Moody is interesting
herself m the contest, for. the reason
that she would get a share of the estate
if the will Is upset, is not verified by
Johnson.
The talesmen examined yesterday
were the following: K. Lundstrom,

Miss Dolbecr's conduct during: the days
preceding her fatal: fall from a sev
.enth-floor window of the Waldorf- As-'
toria Hotel. There . ar,e still more
depositions to come from the East, and
it was on this ground that the contest
ant's attorneys sought a continuance.
: Attorney Hiram \ Johnson told, the
talesmen that the question they would
be called on to - decide was whether or
not Miss Dolbeer was of sound and dis
posing mind when she made herwill in
April last, four months previous to. her
death. The questions he propounded
were of the usual order.
; Miss Warren, from whom attempt is
being â¢ made to wrest a bequest -that
amounts to about $850,000, was not. in
court yesterday. At no stage of the case
has she yet set foot in a courtroom, but
her attorneys said that she would ap
pear as soon" as the introduction of tes
timony should begin.
Schander, on the other hand, was
present with hi? entire family, wife,
daughter and son. .The audience was
devoid of representatives of society, In
which the. case is attracting. much in
terest, largely because so many of 'its
fair members have: been subpenaed to
testify as to the 'mental condition of
Miss Dolbeer at the time she made her
will. Mrs. William C Mugan. wife of
one of the executors, did take a seat be
side'her husband for a. few minutes,
but soon took her departure.
There was nothing, more than exam
ination of talesmen yesterday, but
even ! in these' exciting proceedings
there were a number of sharp remarks
and biting retorts between the lawyers.
Nine talesmen were examined before
evening, but there will be.no accepting
of Jurors until the whole panel shall
have been exan.ined. It is possible that
the jury will be completed late this aft
ernoon. -
Judge Coffey declared an end to post
ponements and the Dolbeer will con
test went to trial yesterday. The long
delayed battle over the estate of $1,000,
000, j the bulk of . which Bertha Dolbeer
bequeathed , to .Etta M. Warren, her
lifelong companion,, was at last. begun
under auspices that indicate a' lone
and bitter fight.
The ! legal array promises much of
vigor and strength of combat.. For
Adolph Schander, the uncle who seeks'
to set aside the will on the ground that
the decedent was of - : unsound mind
when she executed the testament, there
appeared Hiram, and Albert' M. John
son; and Stanley Jackson, the latter a
recent , acquisition. The . beneficiaries
Miss Dolbeer named are represented by
E. S. Pi 11 sbury. Garret TV. McEnerney
and W. F. "Williamson. '. â¢

ADVERTISEMENTS.
BEWARE
Of a cough, especially of infants
and delicate children. Don't wait
until the cough becomes hard, the
throat inflamed and the lungs and
bronchial passages ; congested.
Avoid cough remedies that contain
opiates, 'stupefying. drugs and dan-
gerous anodynes. . They only
quiet . . the . symptomsâ drug the
cough into silenceâ but that is not
curing. A weak place is left to
cause, trouble later. A remedy
must be -used to subdue the in-
flammation, stimulate the secret
tions, soothe and heal the irri-
tated membranes and cure the
cough to stay cured. -
Mtfamsl
Irish Moss Cough Balsam is such
a< remedy^ It enjoys the indorse-
ments of many physicians, who
.use it. in their daily practice. Sold
