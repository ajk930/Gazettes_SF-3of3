ST. PETERSBURG. July 27.â The
mystery of the long cruise taken by
the Vladivostok squadron is accounted
for by a cleverly arranged system for
coaling at sea. Russia has adopted
the system of coaling ships at sea fol
lowed by the United States Navy De

upon the battleship Massachusetts and
the collier Marcelles. Russia ordered
from an American firm a set of tha

Panama railway and the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company shall not be re
newed.
So hard a question to answer has
probably never before been propounded
to the people connected with the
Southern Pacific Company and that
old-time ally of the transcontinental
railways, the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company. Free and competitive trans
portation conditions are promised to
the Pacific Coast permanently and the
situation has therefore become a mat
ter of the gravest consideration. The
domination of the Oriental trade, of the
coastwise trade ef the Pacific Ocean
in Central America and Mexico and
even of the overland rates of freights,
eastbound, from the sea to hundreds
of miles inland, is seemingly about lost
to the great railway and steamship
combination that has for forty years,
with brief Interruption, been used to
control the commerce, trade and indus
trial life of the Pacific Coast.
By Government control of the Pan
ama railway the . United States has
actually a transcontinental road of its
own to use for the benefit of all the
people- It Is not a very long road, but
it is complete in itself, extending from
the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and
having no dependence on any connect
ing line to enable it to move transcon
tinental freights and passengers. In all
respects . it is able, if administered in
accordance with the Interstate com
merce act, \vhich forbids discrimina
tion, to serve. In connection with sea
lines, as a rate maker for all other
transcontinental lines existing or to be
created. It is supposedly as open to
the use of all carriers who may wish to
move freights or passengers over it as
the Panama canal ever will be.
In its free and unrestricted operation
it cannot be controlled by the Pacific!
Mail Steamship Company and the rail- |
ways back of the Pacific Mall. It can- Â»
not be used to bottle up the commerce of i
the United States between the oceans, |
for it will soon have no contract with
the Pacific Mail. For years the Pacific
Mail has kept up a rate tariff .that : on
the face of .it looked to be lower than
the rail rates. In reality it was skill
fully constructed so that It gave the
business to the .transcontinental rail
ways and enabled: them to do as they
would.

"a genera!, systematic carrying of con

ST. PETERSBURG. July 27.âUnmit

Reuter's Agency, display In the ac
counts sent out referring to the Malac
ca affair, according to which the
Malacca was to be given np at once
and promises given that no further
seizures would be made in the Red
Sea. The Emperor even was brought
in as having used his personal Influ
ence to effect this wonderful submis
sion of Russian interests to the grati
fication of British "jingoism."
This attempt to persuade the worll
that a sort of Fashoda haÂ» been work
ed upon Rpssta- is warmly resented
here and I am enabled from the high
est authority to state, once for all. that
Russia has not the slightest intention
of desisting from the right to search
in the Red Sea, or from using her
cruisers to capture ships carrying con
traband wherever it suits her to do so.
I am authorized to say that Sir
Charles Hardinge's message was a
protest and in no wise an ultimatum
and, further, that the right of search
will be even more vigorously enforced
in the Red Sea than elsewhere. Gun
boats are being sent to replace the St.
Petersburg and tha Smolensk, whose
special coal capacity renders them
more useful in other places, which I
am not authorized to divulge, and
which may easily be imagined.
"If we make mistakes and cause loss
to shipping by delays," said my
authority, "we shall naturally give sat
isfaction. This is already being done
in the case of the Scandia.**

A VASTLY important change in traffic conditions ait ccting the business men and shippers of the entire State of California will be the taking over by the United
Â¦*"*Â¦ States Government of the Panama Railway. This means tfiat the chains zviih ivhich the transcontinental lines have bound the shippers have been loosened. The
Government control of the Panama Raihvay makes it possible to ship merchandise on independent bottoms and secure transportation across the isthmus without dis
crimination. Aroused to the seriousness of the situation, the traffic managers of the transcontinental lines and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company haze been in con
ference for several days past with leading merchants. What tlie result of these meetings has been none. will. say, but undoubtedly important concessions will have
to be made by the traffic representatives in order to preserve the carrying trade between N civ York and San Francisco. The new situation is interpreted to mean a

.VOLUME XCVIâ XO. 5S."We recognize the organization of capital
and the organization of labor aa natural out
comes of our â Industrial system. Each kind
of organization ig to be favored so long as Jt
acts in & spirit of Justice and regard for the
rights of others. Each is to be granted the
full protection of the law and each in turn
Is to be held to a strict observance of tha

below it. The humblest Individual is to have
his rights safeguarded as scrupulously as those
of the strongest organization, for each is to
receive Justice, no more and no less. The
problems with which we have to deal in our
modern lndustrlaj and social life are manifold
but the spirit In which It is necessary to ap
proach their solution la simply the spirit of
We believe In reciprocity with foreign na
tions on the terms outlined In President ilc-
Klnley'B last speech, which urged the ex
tension of our foreign markets by reciprocal
agreements whenever they could be - made
without Injury to Amerlca'n industry and
labor. It is a singular fact that the only
great reciprocity treaty recently adopted â that
with Cuba â was finally opposed almost alone
by the representatives of the very party which
now states that it favors reciprocity. And
here again we ask that the worth of our
words be judged by comparing their deeds
with ours. On this Cuban reciprocity treaty
there were at the outset grave differences of
opinion among ourselves, and the notable thing
In the negotiation and ratification of the treaty
and in the legislation which carried It Into
effect was the highly practical mariner in
which, without sacrifice of principle, these
differences of opinion .were reconciled. There
was no rupture of a great party, but an ex
cellent practical outcome, the result of the
harmonious co-operation of two successive
Presidents and two successive Congresses.
This la an Illustration of the governing ca
pacity which entitles us to (he confidence of
the people not only In our purposes bill- in
our practical ability to achieve these purposes.
Judging by the history of the last twelve
years, down to this very month. Is there
Justification for believing that under similar
circumstances and with similar initial dif
ferences of opnion our opponent would have
achieved any practical result?
We have already shewn in actual fact that
our policy Is to do fair and equal Justice to
all men. paying no heed to whether a man
Is rich or poor; paying no heed to his race
his creed or his birthplace.
Those who, like our opponents, "denounce
protection as a robbery," thereby explicitly
commit themselves to the proposition that if
they were to revise the tariff no heed -would
be paid to the necessity of meeting this dif
ference between" the standards of living for
wage- workers here and In other countries;
and therefore on this point their antagonism
to 'our position is fundamental. Here again
we ask that their promises and ours be judged
by what has been done In the Immediate pasi.
We ask that sober and sensible men compare
the workings of the present tariff law and
the conditions which obtain under it. with
the workings of the preceding tariff law of
1S94 and the conditions which that tariff of
1894 helped to bring about.
TARIFF LAWS COMPARED.
We have enacted a tariff law under which
during the last few years the country has at
tained a height of material wellbelng never
before reached. Wages are higher than ever
before. That whenever the need arises there
should be a readjustment of the tariff sched
ules Is undoubted, but such changes can with
safety be made only by those whose devotion
to the principles of a protective tariff is be
vond question, for otherwise the changes would
amount riot to readjustment, but to repeal.
The readjustment when made must maintain
and not destroy the protective policy. To the
farmer, the merchant, the manufacturer this is
vital, but perhaps no other man Is so much In
terested as the wage worker In the mainten
ance of our present economic system, both as
regards the finances and the tariff. The stand
ard of living of our wage workers is higher
than that of any other country, and It cannot
so remain unless we have a protective tariff
which shall always keep as a minimum a rate
of duty sufficient to cover the difference be
tween the" labor cost here and abroad.
Assureaiy It Is unwise to change the policies
which have worked so well and which are now
working so well. Prosperity has come at home.
The national honor and interest have been up
held abroad. We have placed the finances of
this nation upon a sound gold basis. We have
done this with the aid of many who were for
merly our opponents, but who would neither
rpenly support nor silently acquiesce in the
heresy of unsound finance; and we have done
it against the convln*ed and violent opposition
of the mass of our present opponents who still
refuse to recant the unsound opinions which
for the moment they think it Inexpedient to
assert. We know what we mean when we
speak of an honest and stable currency. We
mean the same thing from year to year. We
do not have to avoid a definite and conclusive
committal en, the most important issue which
has- recently been before the people and
which may at any time in the near future be
before .them again. Upon the principles which
underlie this Issue convictions of half of our
i.umber do not clash with those of the other
half. So long as the Republican party is Jn
power the geld standard is settled, not as a
matter of temporary political expedlencey. not
because of shifting conditions in the produc
tion of gold in certain mining centers but in
accordance with what we regard as the funda
mental principles of morality and wisdom.
Under the financial- legislation which we
have enacted there la now ample circulation
for every business need; and every dollar of
this circulation is worth a dollar In gold. We
have reduced the Interest bearing dÂ«tot, and in
Btill larger measure the Interest on tnat debt.
AH of the war taxes imposed during the Span
ish war have been removed with a view to re
lieve the people and to prevent the accumula
tion of an unnecessary surplus. The result la
that hardly ever before havÂ« the expenses and

In the fiscal year that has Just closed the ex

Since the Republican party was restored to
power. In 1S97. under the lead of McKinley.
our country has prospered In production and
in commerce as it has never prospered before.
In wealth we stand first among all the na
tions. Under the lead of William McKinley
the war with Spain was speedily brought to
a successful conclusion. Under the treaty cf
peace and our action Cuba Is free, and, under
guarantees written in her constitution and our
legislation it is assured that she will ever
remain free. We also acquired Porto Rico,
Cuam and Â¦ the Philippines by a treaty the
ratification of which was only possible by the
votes of Democratic Senators. Civil Govern
ment has been established In Porto Rico and
we are journeying toward civil government In
the Philippines as rapidly as the people of the
archipelago are able to receive it; and this, too,
notwithstanding tlje false cry of "Imperial
ism" raised by the Democratic party and htlll
Insisted upon, which led to insurrection in the
Philippines and tends to lead to further insur
rection there. The record of the Republican
party under the lead of William McKinley has
passed Into history. Who dares assail It? -
In the history of the republlc,_ln time of
peace, no executive has had gfeater ques
tions to deal with than yourself, and none
have brought greater courage, wisdom and
patriotism to their solution. You have en
forced the law against the mighty and the
lowly without fear, favor or partiality. Un
der the constitution you have recommended
legislation to Congress from time to time, aa
it was your duty to do,- and when It was
passed by Congress have approved It. You
have, under the constitution, led in making a
treaty which was ratified by the Senate and
is approved by the people, which not only
assures, but under the law and appropriations
made by Congress proceeds with the construc
tion of the Panama canal.
FIRST AMONG THE NATIONS.
Sir. let us turn from the region of doubt
and double dealing, the debatable land, to the
region of assured certainty. The Republican
party stands for protection. It stands for the
gold standard and our currency .system. All
these dwell in legislation enacted under the
lead of the Republican party and against the
most determined opposition of the Democratic
party, including its leader and candidate.
These being our policies, and having been
most useful to the country, we have confidence
in and love them. If it be necessary â¢ from
time to time that they should be strengthened
here and controlled there, the Republican party
stands ready with loving,, competent hands to
apply the proper remedy.
I Bay "remedy." Being our policies, we will
not willingly subject them to their enemies for
â¢low starvation on the one hand or to sudden
destruction on the other.
If this chosen leader and his friends arj
converts to Republican policies, should not
they '"bring forth fruits meet for repentance"
before they ask to be placed in the highest po
sitions to. affect the well being of all; or, if
they profess all things to all men, then they
are not worthy the confidence of any man. If
clothed with power, will they follow in the
paths of legislation according to their loves
and votes as manifested by their action al
ways heretofore, or will they stand by, protect
and defend the gold standard and our currency
system that have been created under the lead
of the Republican party?
Correct revenue laws, protection or free
trade, the gold standard and our currency
system all depend on the sentiment of the
majority of our people as voiced at the ballot
box. A majority may <*iange our revenue
laws; a majority may change our currency
laws; a majority may destroy the gold standard
and establish the silver standard, or, in lieu
of either or both, make the Treasury note, non-
Interest bearing and Irredeemable, the sole
standard of value.
I congratulate him. It Is better to be right
late than never. It Is better to be right In one
thing than wrong in all things. I wonder if It
ever occurred to him that if his vote and sup
port for his party's candidate in IS'Jti and lvtiH)
had been decisive we would now have the sil
ver standard. I wonder what made him send
that telegram, after he was nominated, and
why did he not send It before? When did he
have a change of heart and Judgment? And
does he at heart believe In the gold Btandard
and our currency system, or does he try now
to reap where he hai not sown? If, perchance,
he should be elected by forcing together dis
cordant elements, I HUbmlt that, with a Demo
cratic House of Representatives or House and
Senate, there would be no harmonious action
in legislation, or administration that would
benefit the people, but that doubt and discon
tent would everywhere distress production and
labor. Consumption would be curtailed. In
short, we would have an experience similar to
that from 1893 to 1807. â¢ '
the same time protecting our citizens laboring
in production against the competition of for
eign labor. Under this policy our manufac
tured product to-day is one-third the product
of the civilized world and our people receive
almost double the pay for their labor that
similar labor receives elsewhere In the world.
Hereby enabling us to bear the burdens of
citizenship.
Liberal compensation for labor makes liberal
customers for our progress. Under this policy
Y>f protection our home market affords all our
people a better market than has any other
people on earth and this, too, even if we did
not sell any of our products abroad. In addi
tion to this we have come to be the greatest
exportlne nation in the world. For the year
endinr June 30, 1904. our exports to foreign
countries were valued at 51.4tiO.000.OOO. of
which $450,000,000 were products of the fac
tory. The world fell in our debt last year
$470,000,000. an Increase of $75,000,000 over
the preceding year.
This policy of protection has always been
opposed by the opponents of the Republican
party and Is opposed by them to-day. In
their last national platform, adopted at St.
Louis, they denounce, protection as robbery.
They never have been given power but they
proceeded by word and act to destroy the
policy of protection. Their platform Is as
silent as the grave touching the gold standard
and our currency system. Their chosen leader,
after his nomination, having been as silent
as the sphynx up to that time, sent his tele
gram, saying In substance that the gold
standard is established and that he will gov
ern himself accordingly If he should be elected.
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.
In pursuance of the usual custom the con
vention appointed a committee, of which it
honored me with the chairmanship, to wait on
you and inform you of its action, which duty,
speaking for the committee, I now cheerfully
perform, with the hope and the confident, ex
pectation that a majority of the people of the
republic will In November next approve the
action of the convention by choosing Electors
who will as.Â«ure your election to â¢ the Presi
dency as your own successor.
MR. ROOSEVELT'S ACCEPTANCE.
President Roosevelt shook Cannon's
hand heartily at the conclusion of the
notification speech and then mounted
the chair to deliver his address in re
sponse. So cordial a reception was giv
en to him that it was some time before
he could proceed. He was in excellent
voice, and, though he followed the
printed text of his speech, he seldom
referred to it. The address was punc
tuated by applause. The President
said:
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of the Notifica
tion Committee: I am deeply sensible of the
high honor conferred upon me by the repre
sentatives of the Republican party assembled
in convention, and I accept the nomination for
the Presidency with solemn realization of the
obligations I assume. I heartily approve the
declaration of principles which the national
convention has adopted, and at some future
'day I shall communicate to you. Mr. Chair
man, more at length an&' In detail a formal
written acceptance of the nomination. Three
years ago I became President < because
of the death of my lamented predecessor. I
then stated that It was my purpose to carry
out his principles and policies tor the honor
and the interest of the country. To the beat
of my ability I have kept the promises thus
made. If next November my countrymen con
firm at the polls the action of the conventon
you represent. I shall, under Providence, con
tinue to work with an eye single to the wel
fare of all our people. A party is of worth
only in so far as It promotes the national in
terest, and every official, high or low, can
pcrve his party best by rendering to the peo
ple the best service of which he is capable.
Effective government comes only as thÂ« re
eult of the loyal co-operation of many differ
ent persons. The members of a legislative ma
jority, the officers in the various departments
of the administration, and the legislative and
executive branches as toward each other, must
work together with subordination of self to
the common end of successful government.
We who have been entrusted with power as
public servants 'durlnc the past seven years
of administration and legislation now come
before the people content to be judged by our
record of achievement. In the years that have
gone by we have made the deed square with
the word; and if we are continued in power
we shall unswervingly follow out the great
Ilne3 of public policy which th-j Republican
party has already laid down; a public policy
to which we are giving and shall give a
united and therefore an efficient support. .
In all of these we are more fortunate than
our opponents, who. now appeal for confi
dence on the ground, which some express and
some seek to have confidentially understood,
that if triumphant they may be trusted to
prove false to every > principle which in the
last eight years they have laid down as vital,
and to leave undisturbed those very acts of
the administration fcecause of which they ask
that the administration Itself be driven from
power. Seemingly their present attitude as to
their past record Is that some of them were
mistaken and others Insincere. We make our
appeal In a wholly different spirit. We Rre
not constrained to keep silent on any vital
question; we are divided on no vital ques
tion; our policy Is continuous, and is the
same for all sections and localities. There
is nothing experimental about the govern
ment we ask the- people to continue in power,
for our performance In the past, our proved
governmental efficiency is a guarantee as to
our promises for the future. Our opponents,
either openly or secretly, according to their
several temperaments, now ask the people to
trust to their present promises In considera
tion of the fact that they intend to treat
their past promises as null and void. We
know our own minds and we have kept of th*
same mind for a sufficient length of time to
give to our policy coherence and sanity. In
such a fundamental matter as the enforce
ment of the law we do not have to depend
upon promises, but merely to ask that our
record be taken as an earnest promise of what
we shall continue to do. In dealing with the
great organizations known aa trusts, we do
not have to explain why the laws were not en
forced but to point out that they actually
have been enforced and that legislation has
been enacted to Increase the effectiveness of
their enforcement. We do not have to pro
pose to "turn the rascals out," for we have
shown in every deed that whenever by dili
gent investigation a public official can be
found who has betrayed his trust he will be
punished to the full extent of the law without
regard to whether he was appointed under a
Republican or a Democratic administration.
This le the efficient way to turn the rascals
out and to keep them out, and It has the
merit of sincerity. Moreover the betrayals
of trust In the last seve,n years have been
Insignificant in number when compared with
the extent of the public service. Never has
the - administration of the Government been
on a cleaner and higher level; never has the
of the party and then condemn it. They can,
for selfish or parisan reasons, abuse you per
sonally and misrepresent the party which you
lead. It Is true, however, that eo far thtir
abuse of your action and their alleged fear
of your personality Is insignificant as compared
with the personal and partisan, carpings
against Lincoln, Grant and McKinley when
they were clothed with power by the people.
Those whose only grievance iÂ« that you have
enforced the law and those who carp for snÂ«re
partisan capital will not, in my Judgment, if;i-p
the harvest of success. The Republican party
for you and under your leaderehip appeals to
the great body of the people who live In the
sweat of their faces, make the civilization,
control the republic, fight Its battles and de
termine its policies, for approval and con
tinuance In power. "
The office of President or the United States
Is the greatest on earth and many competent
men in the Republican party are ambitious to
hold it, yet the Republican convention met
at Chicago June last and unanimously, with
one accord,' nominated you as the candidate
of the party for President. I am sure all Re
publicans and a multitude of good citizens who
do not call themselves Republicans taid
"Amen."
Glancing at the button and discover
ing that it bore a fine likeness of Judge
Parker, he remarked:
"That proves absolutely what sub
lime confidence we up-State Repub
licans have in one another."
During the afternoon, before the de
parture of ( the guests, the President
had conferences with several of them.
To-morrow ' President Roosevelt will
start for Washington. It Is not un
likely th*t he will return to Oyster
Bay in two weeks, thus shortening his
proposec stay at the national capita).
American Interests In the Pacific have rap-
Idly grown. American enterprise has laid a
cable across this the greatest of oceans. We
have proved In effective fashion that we wish
the Chinese empire well and desire its Integ
rity and independence. Our foothold In the
Philippines greatly strengthens our position in
the competition for trade of the East; but we
are governing the Philippines in the interest
of the Philippine people themselves. We have
already given them a large share in their
government, and our purpose is to increase this
share as rapidly as they give evidence of in
creasing fitness for the ta3k. The great ma
jority of the officials of the islands, whether
elective or appointive, are already active Fili
pinos. We are now providing for a legislative
assembly. This is the first. step. to be taken in
the future, and it would be eminently unwise
to declare what our next step will be until this
first step has been taken and the results are
manifest. To have gone faster than we have
already gone in giving the Islanders a con
stantly increasing measure of self-government
would have been disastrous. At the present
moment, to give political independence to the
Islands' would result In the Immediate loss of
civil rights, personal liberty and pubic order
as regards the mass of the Filipinos, for the
majority cf the Islanders have been given those
great boons by us and only keep them because
we vigilantly safeguard and guarantee them.
To withdraw our government from the islands
at this time would mean to the average native
the loss of his barely won civil freedom. We
have established in the islands a government
by Americans assisted by Filipinos. We are
steadily striving to transform this Into self
government by the Filipinos assisted by the
Americans. The principles which we uphold
should appeal to all our countrymen in all por
tions of our country. Above all, they should
give us strength with the men and women who
are the spiritual heirs of those v.ho upheld
the hands of Abraham Lincoln, for we are
striving to do our work in the spirit Â¦with
which Abraham Llncol napproached his. Dur
ing the seven years that have Just passed there
Is no duty, domestic or foreign, which we
have shirked;- no necessary task which we
have feared to undertake, or which we have
not performed with reasonable efficiency. We
have naver pleaded Impotence. We have never
sought refuge In criticism and complaint In
stead of action. We face the future with our
past and our present as guarantors cf our
promises, and we are content to stand or fall
by the record which we have made and are
making.
CALLS FOR GOVERNOR PARDEE.
After the informal reception which
followed the address. Speaker Cannon
suggested that all the visitors assem
ble on the lawn at the foot of the
veranda steps "in order that they have
their respective shadows secured ere
the substance fade." As the President
descended the steps to face the pho
tographer he called for Governor Par
dee of California and "W. S.' Simpson
of Texas to stand near him. These
two, with Speaker Cannon. Chairman
Cortelyou, Governor Odell of New
York, Cornelius N. Bliss and Frank S.
Black, were grouped about the Presi
dent as the photographs were taken.
A buffet luncheon followed. The
President's children, nephew and nieces
served the guests.
Early in the afternoon William
Barnes Jr. of Albany pinned a cam
paign button on the coat of former
Governor Black. "While Black was
conversing with .the President. Gov
ernor Odell approached and. seeing the
button, inquired: Â¦
"Black, when did you leave the Re
publican party?"
"Haven't left," was. the reply.
"Then, why are you wearing that but
ton.around here?"
Our foreign policy has been so conducted
that, while not one of our Just claims ha3
been sacrificed, our relations with all foreign
nations are now of the most peaceful kind;
there is not a cloud qn the horizon. The last
cause of irritation between us and any other
nation was removed by the settlement of the
Alaska boundary.
In the Caribbean Sea we have made good
our promises of independence to Cuba, and
have proved our assertion that our mission in
the Island was one of justice and not of self
aggrandizement; and thereby no lesa than by
our action In Venezuela and Panama we hava
ehown that the Monroe doctrine la a living
reality, designed for the hurt of no nation,
hut for the protection of civilization on the
Western continent, and for the peace of tha
world. Our steady growth in power has gone
hand in hand with a strengthening disposition
to use this power with strict regard for th*
rights of others, and for the cause of inter
national justice and good will.
We earnestly desire friendship with all the
nations of the new and old world; and we
endeavor to place our relations with them upon
a^ basis of reciprocal advantage Instead of
hostility. We hold that the prosperity of each
nation is an aid and not a hindrance to the
prosperity of other nations. We seek inter
national amity for the same reasons that make
us believe in peace within our borders; and
we seek this peace not because we are afraid
or unready, but because we think peace Is
right as well as advantageous.

In Inaugurating the great work , of Irriga

The ceremony was informal. As
Speaker Cannon, attired in a dark
frc-ck suit, stepped on a chair near the
veranda railing, he was greeted cor
dially. While he read the notification
President Roosevelt stood at his right
hand, giving close attention to the ad
dress. Mrs. Roosevelt, surrounded by
her children, Kermit, Ethel and Quen
tin, stood facing Cannon, almost in the
center of the crowd.
CAXXON'S NOTIFICATION SPEECH
Cannon was frequently interrupted
by applause. His thrusts at the Demo
cratic party, his reference to the tar
iff and to the gold standard and to the
construction of the Panama canal
aroused much enthusiasm. He spoke
as follows:
Mr. President â Tha people of the United
States, by blood, heredity, education and
practice are a. self-governing people. W> have
sometimes been subject to prejudice and em
barrassment from harmful conditions, but we
have ouutrown prejudice and overcome condi
tions as rapidly as possible, with due regard
to law and the rights of Individuals. We have
sometimes made mistakes from a false sense
of security or from a desire to change poli
cies Instead of letting well enough alone,
merely to see what would happen; but we
have always paid the penalty of unwise ac
tion at the ballot box and endured the suffer
ing until, under the law, through the ballot
box. we have returned to correct policies.
Tested bv experience, do nation has no suc
cessfully solved all problems . and chosen
proper policies as our nation. â¢ â¢
President Roosevelt personally re
ceived the members of the committee
and other guests as they arrived at
Sagamore Hill. He knew almost every
man personally. After the visitors had
been greeted by the President, Secre
tary Loeb presented each one to Mrs.
Koosevelt and to Miss Alice Roosevelt.
Mrs. Roosevelt extended to all a cordial
welcome and the hospitality of her
home.
After some consultation between the
President, Speaker Cannon, Chairman
Cortelyou and Secretary Loeb, It was
decided to hold the exercises on the
veranda.
Speaker Cannon and his committee
of notification, together with many of
the invited guests, arrived on a special
train from New York at 11:30 o'clock
in the morning, the run from New
York having been made in an hour.
The attendance of the members of the
committee was notably large, regrets
beinji received from only three â James
N. Combs of Florida, Senator Depew of
New Yorlc and Senator Clark of Wyo
ming. Senator Depew is in Europe and
Senator Clark was prevented by im
portant business from being present.
PRESENTED TO MRS. ROOSEVEI/T
From the arrival of the special train
with the National Committee an board
until Its departure not a hitch occurred.
In accordance with the wish of the
President, the ceremony was made as
simple as possible.
The formal notification of the nomi
nation was made" on behalf of a com
mittee representing every State and
Territory in the United States by Jo
seph G. Cannon, Speaker of the House.
The day opened with ideal weather
and the arrangements for the cere
mony were completed at an early hour.
The wide veranda of the President's
house at Sagamore Hill, extending al
most entirely around the building, was
decorated with American flags hung
from pillar to pillar. In addition many
houses in the neighborhood of the
iloosevelt home in Oyster Bay were
draped with the national colors. Across
the main street of the village there
hung a large Roosevelt and Fairbanks
banner.
President Roosevelt's speech of ac
ceptance was characteristically force
ful and direct in argument and replete
with epigrammatic passages. It was
received with immense enthusiasm by
his audience. His satirical references
to the Democratic party aroused laugh
ter and applause.
7 As the President concluded his speech
Speaker Cannon, chairman of the
notification committee, grasped his
hand and congratulated him cordially.
George B. Cortelyou, chairman of the
Republican National Committee, then
extended his congratulations. He was
followed by all the members of the
notification committee and the guests.
The speech of the President will be
circulated extensively in the campaign,
as aside from the letter of acceptance,
which he will issue in a few weeks, it
probably will be his only public utter
ance during the campaign.
SAGAMORE UUAj ASTIR EARIA*.
OYSTER BAY. L. I., July 27.â
Theodore Roosevelt . to-day fo/mally
opened the present campaign of l*)04 at
his country home, Sagamore Hill.
Standing on a spot made dear to him
hy the associations of a lifetimes sur
rounded by his family and relatives
and friends, and in the presence of an
assemblage of men distinguished in ell
walks of. life, he formally received and
accepted the nomination of the Repub
lican party for President of the United
States.
The Democrats are making extensive
preparations for the Parker and Davi3
ratification meeting at the Alhambra
Theater to-night. Thomas J. Geary
has been added to the list of orators.
Joseph S. Tobin will preside. Timothy
Spellacy of Kern, chairman of the
State committee, was at Democratic
headquarters, California Hotel, yester
day.
Judge Murasky will sit In his cham
bers on next Monday and Thursday
evenings, August 1 and 4, at 8 o'clock to
accommodate aliens who desire to com
plete thoir naturalization. It is requis
ite to entitle an alien to vote that he
be naturalized ninety days before an
election. August 10 will be the last day
on which an alien can qualify for the
Presidential election, November 8, 1904.
To-night there will be meetings In the
various Assembly districts for the pur
pose of proposing the names of men to
represent the party in the State, Con
gressional and local conventions. The
conferences to-night will be under the
immediate auspices of the Republican
County Committee. In three or four
districts Independent tickets will be put
forward to represent the sentiment of
vcters who are not inclined to obey the
direction of the local governing body of
the party. Independent Republicans of
the Thirty-second Assembly District
will meet at Maennerbund Hall next
Saturday evening and propose delegates
for the State and city conventions, and
the votes of the party on primary elec
tion day will decide the contest- The
nomination for State Senator to repre
sent the Ninteenth Senatorial District
is involved in the fight, and there are
indications that the independent dele
gation will support Senator Richard J.
Welch for another term.
The County Committee programme
may not prove acceptable to the Re
publican citizens of the Forty-first As
sembly District, as it is intimated that
John H. Nelson is slated for renomlna
tlon to the State Senate to represent
the Twenty-fifth Senatorial District, of
which the Forty-first Assembly District
is a subdivision. It is fairly well un
derstood that Nelson has the support
of A. Ruef. Republicans of the Forty
first are inclined to support E. J. Prin
gle for Senator.
For the Assembly to represent the
Forty-first, Maxwell McNutt is men
tioned. The district is largely Repub
lican, but the voters are quick to resent
anything which bears the semblance of
outside interference in their local af
fairs. When regular nominations are
not acceptable to the citizens, independ
ent tickets are put in the field and gen
erally elected.
At the primary election Tuesday.
August 9. delegates to the nominat
ing conventions of the several political
parties will be chosen. The Republi
cans of San Francisco are all taking
an interest In the coming event.
"Everything has been agreeable to
me. I am here. In common with other
Democrats throughout the country, to
assist in promoting Democratic har
mony and success. Everything that
has occurred has impressed me with
the fact that there is nothing to pre
vent all Democrats uniting and mak
ing a successful canvass in the State
and nation. New York City will give
the greatest majority ever known."
Murphy discusse4 State politics with
Judge Parker and various State lead
ei-E. It may be. said upon, competent
authority that Parker and Murphy got
very close together on that subject.
The Governorship and other places on
the State ticket were among the mat
ters talked over. That he is not com
mittal to Mayor McClellan of New
York for Governor is one of the things
the Tammany leader is said to have
told Judge 'Parker.' who is said to have
spoken earnestly in favc-r of the Mayor.
Every vehicle- in Esopus was needed
to convey the committee from the. train
to Rosemount and even then a second
trip was necessary. Judge Parker wel
comed his visitors, on the veranda. Da^
vid B. Hill was in 'Judge Parker's wag
onette, which was first to arrive. When
he Paw Murphy he strode toward him
with outstretched hand and with a
cordial "How are you. Murphy?" The
greeting was" hearty on both sides.
lLowling joined them, and as Judge
Parker's attention "was engaged in
greeting other guests, the trio con
versed for * two- or three minutes.
Charles F. Mtxrphy. just before depart
ing, said:

phy joined hands ori the Rosemount
veranda and others who have hot been
political friends for years put aside
their differences, and, for the day at
least, met on common ground.
The coining of the National Commit
tee was heraldrd far and- wide, but no
announcement had been made of the
proposed visit of the Tammany dele
gation. Several of the committeemen
expressed surprise at finding the New
York men at llosemount, but Murphy
made no effort to avoid meeting the

President Roosevelt's move In favor
of open competition between carriers,
by the use of the Panama railway,
under conditions that eliminate all dis
crimination, has filled the business men
and manufacturers of the coast with
enthusiasm. Growing out of it is a
possibility that the trade area of San
Francisco may be permanently extend

The interests of New York and Cali

both on the seaboard, are the same in
the freedom of the Panama road. The
transcontinental carriers have been
making rates that favor Chicago and
Middle "V\Test points as against New

the expense ,of the Atlantic seaboard.

Mitchell stated that he represented
the Portland Milling Company. The

flour, worth about 5100,000. He declared
this flour was not destined for Japan

VICTORIOUS NIGHT ATTACK.
A lengthy meeting of the defense
committee took place to-day under the
presidency of Premier Balfour, at
which the Attorney General, Sir Rob
ert Finlay, was present. Sir Robert
was called in to advise as to the ques
tions of international law Involved.
In the opinion of these diplomats the
cargo, or at least a portion of the cargo
of the Knight Commander, included
contraband of rar, under the Russian
declaration. The bridge work among
the cargo Is said to have been destined
for the Fusan-Seoul Railway, which
the Japanese are building for military
puri>oses. The Russian" declaration
also announced that rice and other
foodstuffs were contraband if sent at
the enemy's cost or order.
Attention is specifically called to the
feature of the declaration saying that
neutral ships with contraband of war
of any sort can, according to circum
stances, be not only seized, but also
confiscated. If the ship can be confis
cated, it is contended, she cak be sunk
as well.
"There is no question of loss of life,
but I am afraid there is a question of
breach of international law."
In the Iiijht of the declaration of the
Russian Government respecting con
traband of war, made three weeks
after hostilities commenced, no repre
sentations have been made by Count
Benckeridorff, the Russian Embassa
dor to Great Britain, to Foreign Secre
tary Lansdowne regarding the Knight
Commander, the Embassador not hav
ing received advices from St. Peters
burg on the sub4Â«ct. nor is it seen by
the Russian diplomats how it is possi
ble for their Government to make a
prompt answer to the British demands.
It is not known when the Vladivostok
squadron will return to port. The com
mander of the squadron, it Is pointed
out, unquestionably seized the papers
"of the vessel, including her manifest,
and. therefore, will be able to present
reasons to show why he sank the ship,
and, with his reasons in their posses
sion, the. Russian authorities will be
able to complete their answer to the
British representations.
CONTRABAND IN<THE CARGO.
LONDON, July 27.â The British Gov
ernment sent instructions to Sir
Charles Hardinge, the British Embas-
Tsador to Russia, to-day to energetically
protest against the sinking of the Brit
ish steamship Knirht Commander by
thejRussian Vladivostok squadron. Un
til the presentation of the note to the
Russian Government the greatest se
crecy will be maintained regarding its
contents, but it is known that Premier
Balfour and his colleagues have de
cided to demand that the fullest rep
aration be made by Russia or stern
measures will be taken.
The British note which Sir Charles
Hardlusre will submit will not men
tion the amount of indemnity Russia
must pay the owners of the ship and
British subjects having goods on board
the vessel, but all that will be sought
will be the establishment of the prin
ciple of indemnity and apology. A
salute of the British flag also must be
conceded and the future protection of
neutral shipping assured.
The attitude of the British Govern
ment is the result of .thorough consid
eration given to reports received from
Sir Claude Macdonald, the British Min
ister ct Tokio. and the examination of
International law authorities by legal
experts. The dispatches from 8ir
Claude Macdonald confirm the reports
that the Knight Commander had no
contraband of war/on board for the
Japanese. The Government and all the
British authorities. It is asserted, unite
on the point that there was no justifi
cation for the sinking of the vessel.
It is felt in Government circles that
the Knight Commander incident over
shadows the Red Sea seizures, which
practically have been adjusted, but
which have failed to settle the question
of the rights of neutral commerce.
BALFOUR INFORMS PARLIAMENT
That the British Government regards
the sinking of the steamship Knight
Commander as a breach of inte^rnation
al law was confirmed by Premier Bal
four in the House of Commons this
afternoon. Answering questions re
garding destruction of the Ke-jcJu
Commander and the seizure of the
Malacca and other vessels, the Prem
ier said he hoped to be in a position
to make a brief statement regarding
the Malacca to-morrow. As to the
sinking of the Knight Commander he
"regretted that information which
reached me this morning confirmed
this regrettable occurrence." Balfour

"The Russian squadron is intact and
the health of the garrison Is splendid,
but the sameness of food is trying."
"The Japanese are discouraged by the
failures which they made to close the
entrance at Port Arthur with fireships
and have stopped sending them in.
They have also grown tired of bom
barding the fortress and shore bat
teries.
'The Japanese have between 40.000
and 50,000 operating before Port Arthur.
The troops maintain a constant ex
change of skirmishing fire, but the field
or other guns are usually silent. The
Japanese apparently are conducting a
slow, engineering advance. Often in the
morning the Russians discover fresh
trenches. The Japanese are compelled
to abandon this work in the day time,
as the Russians regularly open fire
on them as soon as daylight discloses
the works. The activity of the Japan
ese at sea is confined almost exclu
sively to nocturnal raids of the torpedo
boat destroyers and torpedo-boats, the
sowing of mines and the attacking of
guard boats.
""The main forces of the besiegers arÂ«
on the average at a distance of twenty
miles from the perimeter of the fortress
on the Russian right, but the Japanese
have approached to within twelve miles
on the Russian left.
"To sum up. by the fighting of July
3. 4 and 5, when evidently the Russian
forces were acting on the offensive, the
Russians regained on the land side the
positions they had held in front of "the
fortress previous to the battle of Kln
chou.
CHEFU. July 27.â Russian refugees
from Port Arthur, who have arrived
here, report that the Lieutenant Buku
roff and two other Russian torpedo
boat destroyers were torpedoed and to
tally destroyed by the Japanese on the
night of July 25.
LIAOYANG, July 27.â A Russian
correspondent of the Associated Press,
who has just arrived here after two
months' stay at Port Arthur, gives an
interesting narrative of -the situation
at the beleaguered fortress when he left
there. July 14, which shows that the
Japanese operations until then had not
advanced as tar as supposed. Several
Russian successes are chronicled, but
the report of a Japanese reverse, with
the loss of 30,000 men. is definitely dis
posed of. not -toeing even mentioned by
the correspondent, who says:
"When I put to sea in a Junk the
land position on the Russian right
flank, surrounding (Jreen and Sema
phore Hills, which the Russians had
lest, had been recaptured by assault.
The heights of Huinsin. which the Jap
anese defended desperately, alone re
mained in their hands. But I am con
vinced that this position also has since
been retaken. The very morning of my
departure. July 14, the position was be
ing bombarded by six-inch howitzers
and shells were falling repeatedly into
the Japanese works, causing great dis
order.
The Japanese began the advance
against the Russian' positions south of
Tatchekiao on Saturday, July 23. On
this day the vanguard occupied posi
tions in the vicinity of Chuchiatun, to
the southeast " of Tatchekiao, .develop
ing the position and strength of 'the
enemy. The Russian line was through,
the hills south of Tatchekiao, â¢ extend
ing almost due east and west of the
railroad. The positions of the enemy
were fortified. The strongest point was
at Taiping Mountain, to the southeast
of Tatchekiao, and here the heaviest
force had assembled- The Russians had
two batteries of artillery posted near
Chatenganon, due south of Tatchekiao
and ahead of. the main line.
The Japanese deployed to the west-
Advancing on Sunday, General Oku
found a superior, force confronting him,
and that a heavy artillery fire from
the enemy was checking his men. . He
thereupon decided to hold the positions
he then held and to attempt a night
surprise. This was successful, the
Japanese troops sending the Russians
Into a retreat to Tatchekiao. The Jap
anese had only S00 casualties, iso esti
mates of the Russian losses are given.
The Takushan army did not partici
pate in this fight, it being located to
the east of Tatchekiao. Moving to the
northwest this force fought and won a
separate action on Friday, July. 22, at
Panling, losing thirty-one men. The
commander of . the" Takushan army
charges that the Russians violated the
Japanese flag, which they hoisted in
an attempt to deceive the Japanese,
after which they fired a volley into the
Japanese ranks. The Russians left
fourteen dead at Panling.
RUSSIANS WELL FORTIFIED.
TOKIO, July 27.â In a daring night
attack against a Russian force esti
mated at five divisions, with 100 guns.
General Oku succeeded In driving the
enemy from his strong line of defenses
south of Tatchekiao.
"Our losses have not been ascertain
ed, but they are estimated at about
twenty officers and 600 men killed and
wounded. Among the wounded is Colo
nel Auspensky, commanding-the Tomsk
regiment.
"I must testify to the remarkable
firmness displayed by all the troops in
my command, during this difficult ac
tioL, which lasted eighteen hours. The
Siberian regiments which had met the
main Japanese attack In particular dis
tinguished themselves t>y their un
wavering endurance. , Not an Inch of
ground was yielded, despite the enorm
ous numerical superiority of the enemy
and the repeated attacks on our 'center,
where the fighting on four occasions
was conducted at close quarters with
the bayonet, which the Japanese could
not withstand.
"The list of the men meriting rewards
for their share in this glorious fight
will follow. In the meantime I beg to
mention the great valor of the Tebolsk
and Tomsk regiments, of two bat
talions of the Semipalatlnsk regiment
and in particular of the Barnaoulsk
regiment, which , covered itself with
glory-. The conduct of all our batteries,
which remained in action for fifteen
and a half hours under heavy fire, was
beyond all praise.
"I am -unable to give the exact num
ber of losses sustained by the Japanese,
but I venture to say that their losses
were greater than ours."
JAPAN'S VERSION OF BATTLE.
LOSSES ARE NOT GREAT.
"At 7:30 o'clock the Japanese fire was
at its height, and In the last rays* of
the setting sun the enemy delivered his
attack on the Barnaoulstk regiment.
The latter, reinforced by three bat
talions under the command of Colonel
Debrotln, valiantly swept back the
enemy, making four bayonet charges
and capturing a number (not yet ascer
tained) of rifles, together with ammu
nition.
"At 9 o'clock in the evening the can
nonade ceased, but the rifle fire 'con
tinued until late in the night. We re
tained all our positions.
"After the fight it was ascertained
that our eighteen battalions had been
engaged with at least two Japanese
divisions, supported by an overwhelm
ing number of other batteries. The
general extent of the position meas
ured nine miles. In these circum
stances I did not think it advisable to
resume the action on the following day
and resolved to retreat toward tho
nocih. The withdrawal was effected
in pÂ«tect order.
"'At about 7 o'clock in the morning
Japanese infantry was observed mass
ing in ilantsiatoun, Tantsuokara and
Dafanshen. The fire now became cen
tered on our troops occupying the
heights south of Tsianchiatsia. At the
same time two battalions of Japanese
infantry attempted to occupy a moun
tain to the northwest of Dafanshen;
but, being dislodged by our artillery,
the Japanese took flight. Our shells
burst full in the enemy's ranks.
"At about 11 o'clock between three
and four Japanese battalions were
firing on our troops occupying the
heights of Tsianchiatsia. A battery of
Russian field artillery and another
horse artillery then began to fire from
Nandaline, their fire converging upon
Dafanshen. As a result the Japanese
fire slackened.
"Immediately after 11 o'clock the
troops posted at Tsianchiatsia were re
inforced by a reserve battery, our fire
again causing considerable slackening
of the enemy's cannonade.
BATTALION LOSES HEAVILY.
"At 2 o'clock In the afternoon all of
our artillery, beginning from the Nan
daline position, changed front and
opened fire upon Dafanshen with such
marked success that the troops in that
section of the field attempted to take
the offensive against the Japanese right
flank. A battalion sent in advance re
ported the presence of large reserves
of the enemy on the line from Ment
siatoum to Fanchankau. The battalion
sustained heavy casualties and was
obliged to retire. At the same time the
Japanese occupying the heights of
Fanchankau threw forward at least
three more batteries.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 27. â The
Emperor has received from General
Kuropatkin a report conveying Gen
eral Zaroubaieff's account of the bat
tle of Ttachekiao. The report details
the engagement sX great length and In
dicates that the Japanese claims of
victory were unfounded. The Russian
force repulsed the Japanese at all
points and held their positions through
out the entire day. *At night, finding
that the Japanese were being heavily
reinforced. ZaroubaiefC ordered a re
tirement, which was carried out in per
fect order and without losses. This
retreat was in accordance with Gen
eral Kuropatkin's orders to fall back
rather than risk a decisive battle
against superior numbers. Zarou
baieff's report, after describing the
opening stages of the engagement, is in
part as follows: * s
CHICAGO. July 27.â "We had an
tgrctment v.ith Mr. Donneiiy"s organi
zation and the Allied Trades, which
ttey failed to live up to, and under
the circumstances we do not care to
ir.&keD any further agreements with
ihern-"
This is the statement which was
egiied by vhe representatives of the
I-ackers ar.d handed to the members of '
the State Board of Arbitration to-night
at the end cf a conference between the
two bodies, held at the request of the
State Board in an endeavor to bring
about another meeting for the settle
ment of the butchers' strike between
the packers and the striker?.
The packers received the State Board
courteously and listened to their argu
tr.ents for a peaceable adjustment of
the difficulty. The announcement that
the packers were opposed to any fur
ther i^ace negotiations with the strik
ers was handed to the Board by Arthur
Meeker and Thomas Connor, both of
Armour &~Co., who represented the
packerp.
While from their statement it would
appear that the packers are opposed to
meeting the strikers again on any
terms, such is not the case. At the
last conference between the strikers
.'r.d the packers the latter informed the
Â¦union leaders that at any time they
expressTC-d a desire to live up to the
original agreement, signed a. week ago.
v.hich provided for the reinstatement of
ihe striking butchers inside of forty
r.ve days and for the arbitration of all
grievances, the packers would be will
:rg to renew ftt**-agreement.
. â¢ .The contention of the packers is
tf.at *his agreement is still in force.
Â¦a: : A r-p they are unwilling to offer any
farther concessions to the strikers
ihf.y fay a renewal of peace negotia
tions with the hope of securing better
tjrrr.s would be useless. The labor
leaders say. that when the butchers
Â»'ent* on the second strike because of
siilered discrimination by the packers
in .rehiring 'strike employes the arbi
tration agreement was nullified, and
that it Is necesrary to sign a new
issrrtenient before a settlement can be
reached.
' Poiine rule" to-day was declared

cay there were several minor dlsturb

would kill her if she made the least
noise. Before she . could scream again
the ruffian seized her by the throat
and commenced choking her. By that
time other Sisters began to arrive on
the scene, but the man did not make
any move to leave the room till one
of the large mastiffs kept In the build

proceedings he began last week to gain
possession of his daughter, Etta M.
Handle, who was living at the Notre
Danie Academy at Alameda. When
the matter came up for hearing this
morning before Judge Ogden the ap
plicant did not make an appearance.
He made the allegation in his petition
for the -writ that the child was being
restrained of her liberty by the sisters
in charge of the institution. When the
writ came .up for hearing last week,
letters of guardianship were applied
for by Miss Esther Hoover of San
Francisco, and both matters went over
until to-day%
In the petition Miss Hoover made the
charge that the father was not a proper
person to have the custody of the child.
It was further developed that the girl,
who is just 15 years of age, was taken
from the father by a Rebekah lodge of
San Francisco and placed at the con
vent. Her mother had been a Rebekah
ard the lodge took the case of the girl
in hand on that account- At her death
Mrs. Randle left $700, and with this the
lodge paid the sisters to take care of
the child until she was 18. Miss Esther

dian to-day.

Both Dearborn and Murdock em
phatically declare that the reported
battle with burglars at Sather station
was in fact exactly as they related the
occurrence to their superiors. They
deny that there was any "fake" about
it.
The investigation of the affair by the
Sheriff's office and the Southern Pa
cific Company detectives the next day
showed some glaring discrepancies be
tween the story as told by the deputy
constables and the facts as they ap
peared. It all had such a queer look
that to-day action was taken and the
appointments of the men were re
voked.
Dearborn and Murdock told the de
tectives that they were shot at when
about 150 yards away from the build-
Ing and returned the fire from that
distance. The angle of the shots
through the walls showed clearly that
the bullets were fired hardly twenty
feet away from it.
All the shots went into the building
and there was nothing to show that
any had been shot from within. A
blood-stained handkerchief was pur
ported to have been picked up the
next morning by the constables, but
the blood was dry and apparently
many days old. When the entire story
had been analyzed it was found to be
incredible.
Closely following the reported sen
sational midnight battle between Dep
uty Constables Frank Dearborn and
Edward Murdock and six robbers at
Father station last Friday night has
come the revocation of their appoint
ment as deputy constables. This ac
tion was taken by Constable Cramer
to-day, who had reason to believe that
no robbers attacked his deputies and
that they did all the shooting that was
done themselves.

In the case of the composer. Professor
Stanley said in closing, that, all things
being equal, there is much to be said in
favor of the training made possible in
the university and which exists no
where else. This. .is because there is
danger that the specialist in music
may, like the investigator in other
subjects, lose sight of the relation of
his specialty to life, which is after all
the true end of education..
Professor Albert A. Stanley, professor
of music'at the University of Michigan,
sees no good reason why a university
cannot teach music as well as any
school that is organized specifically to
give instruction in the art. In fact, there
is much to be said in favor of the uni
versity teaching music," declares Pro
fessor Stanley, because along with this
special instruction goes the education
in history, philosophy and the modern
languages 'that make for the broaden
ing of the Intellect of the student and
turn him into a more receptive, sympa
thetic being.
Professor Stanley gave expression to
his views before his summer-school
class in music this afternoon at the
University of California, where he
spoke upon "Music and the University."
In considering the position of music in
the university, he said it must of neces
sity be treated as a subject for grad
uate work, and for research, and finally
its relation to the whole university
must be emphasized. As a subject for
graduate work music must bear the
same relation to college work that
specialization in other departments
bear to training in other academic
courses, and the highest degree in
music should only be given to those
who have done either research or cre
ative work of a high grade.
Speaking of the establishment of a
strictly professional department of
music, Professor Stanley said that he
would insist on the same entrance re
quirements as are given for the de
partment of art. Continuing he said:
I would not give more than forty hours in
thlg course. In addition to it I would Insert
a study course in history, physics, pholosophy.
modern languages and pedagogy. I would in
sist that the candidate for admission should
present in addition to the entrance require
ments, or in place of the same number, two
units, one of harmony and the other the ability
to play Intelligently and artisticallyâ the two
are practically synonymous â a Beethoven so
nata of the difficulty of Opus 26. or a bach
fugue, either of A or G minor. That would
represent mora years of intensive work and a
wider range of general knowledge of literature
than the average requirement.
I woiild debar fo-called special students. I
would allow students to pursue the study of
e'thrr t"r.o piano or violin under an instructor
of university grade and give them credit up

To settle - accounts with the con
tractor a special bond election calling
for $6000 was held recently, but the
proposition was defeated.
In the investigation that has follow
ed, J. H. Strowbridge. a well-to-do citi
zen of Haywards. at his own expense
employed a building expert to examine
the structure, but his work was not
completed, as the contractor had lock
ed r.p the school, preventing an interior
inspection. Attorney E. G. Ryker was
also employed to assist in raveling the
tangle, but he has been unable to find
on record the copies of the plans and
specifications.
Meanwhile the new â¢Echoolhouse is in
the hands of the contractor. The
school trustees are G. S. Langan, Peter
J. Crosby and Dr. A. J. Dean. They
have made another effort to raise the
$6000 by calling an election to levy a
special tax in the district.
Bolted and barred against occupancy
is the new S30.OO0 grammar school
hsilding; at Kaywards. Contractor W.
W. Anderson, who erected the struc
ture, has refused to deliver the edifice
to the school trustees because,, he
< laims. th^re is a balance due on ac
tount of construction of $6000. In view
cf the tangle, the trustees will be com
pelled to begin the new school year on
Monday in the old building. They had
hoped to commence the term in the
i:cw structure, which is a modern one
in, every particular.
The trouble arises over an item of
Jlfl.000 difference in the estimated cost
id the building and the actual outlay
as shown by the contractor's accounts.
How the discrepancy arose is a matter
the trustees have under inquiry. Last
year Laurel school district voted $30,
000 in bonds to erect the building. As
i he work progressed this money was
eptnt and 59000 more, which was in the
school district fund. At this time it is
estimated that 510,000 additional will
be required to pay the amount claimed
by Anderson and to buy the necessary
furnishings.

burden be shared by both the ferry
systems, the Southern Pacific boat and
the Key Route boat to operate alter

Since the< appointment of the com

business men of Oakland on the sub

been spoken to and they appeared to
approve of the move. An attempt will
be made to reach an understanding at
the conference to-morrow.
The Merchants' Exchange of Oakland

an all-night service between Oakland

transportation between midnight and

ilr. Webster, whose large head had

"Rather than deprive the amuse

scribed." said the Judge, "I would 50

give myself the extreme punishment

M. W. Valentine dropped into the
jewelry shop of T. Hirshfeid. on
Montgomery avenue, with the osten
sible purpose of purchasing a watch
and stories differ as to how the J5&
window was' smashed. Mr. Valentine
swears that when he offered S3 for a
timepiece that was ticketed J7 50 he
was suddenly seized and hurled
through the plate glass by Mr. Hirsch
feld. and Mr. Hirschfeld swears with
e<ical emphasis that Mr. Valentine de
liberately smashed the window while
he was enraged because he coald not
buy the watch at his own figure. Judge
Conlan carefully weighed both state
ments then pronounced Mr. Val
entine guilty of malicious mischief.
Passing of sentence postponed till to
day.
Sixteen-year-old I^aura Murray's
father confessed regret that he did
not permit his daughter to wed the
lad of her choice six months ago. for
since then the girl has fallen utterly
from grace. She was before Judge
Fritz yesterday on a charge of way
wardness and her saucy and deSant
demeanor was not reminiscent of thÂ«
shrinking little maiden who wept
while her sire was appealing to the
same court to restrain her from be
coming a bride.
"It would have been better â and I
think I said so at the time â if you had
allowed the girl to wed the young fel
low who wanted to make her his
wife." said the Judge to Mr. Murray.
Then she was consigned to an asylum
for incorrigible young women.
As a r*rr V pT * trrmnt Carl 3 S-?lori walketl
into Police Jucise Cor.lan"s courtroom
yesterday morning, and as a defendant
he was escorted out of it- Ke "litered
with haughty En.*en and departed -fith
crtiifcid spirit.
Flrxnefcco yis.g'Sio was the person
T.-fco had been arrested on ccmplaint
of Senor Erfcrf. and the charge was
threatening to slay. Ths testimony:
showed that Sencr Selori. after quar- i
rt-Iing with his wife, went to the resi
dence of S-'nora llary Casearanex. at
11" Vailejo street, ia Quest of solace, and
there found Scoor Maggio being enter
tained by the lady. Instead of awaken
ing the condolence he had anticipated.
S^ncr Sslori's recital of his connubial
infelicities provoked only unsympathetic
remarks from Sencra. Cascaranex and
Senor Maggie, and then Senor Selori
worth and began to smash fur
niture and bric-a-brac. His ejectment
by Sencr llairgicnsras prompt and un
a'ded. the chatelaine with the surname
reminiscent cf a popular patent medi
cine merely remarking that she intend
ed to institute legal proceedings to re
cover the cash equivalent at her shai
tered household geo>Â±s- It was probably
with a view to forestalling the lady in
the law's enlistment, and thu* weaken
ing her claim for damages, that Senor
Selori sorstit a policeman and com
plained tha.t hi* life had been menace J
by Senor Maggio. At acy rate that
was the Qsfct En which Judge Conlsn
saw the arrest, for he dismissed tit
charge against Senor Maggio and or
dered the issuance of a warrant for
S>nor S^lorL
â¢The complainant in this case." said
his Honor, "had no justiciable ground
whatever uj^n. "Â»"h:ch. to base his com
plaint, and the testimony shows that
he was the aggressor throughout. I
will sign a warrant accusing him of
disturbing the t^act?."
That was bow Senor Selori became a
d-fendant- He was taken In custody
by the l-ailin*. and te-day he will be
tried.

Clement Shoenberg/s wife and Arnold
LÂ»rvan's wife, both residing on Xatcma
street, between Fourth and Fifth,
bickered and quarreled until their re
spective neighbors were drawn into the
trouble and fotxght each other with
fists. Peace-loving- neighbors biew po
lice whistles and the two policemen
who responded made out a clear case
aeainst Mr. Shoenberg and Mr. Levan.
Judge Fritz, however, found extenuat
ing circumstances, for he fined the de
fendants only St 5<? apiece and advised
them to let their better halves finish
without reinforcements any future
"scraps"' in. which they may engage as
opponents.
Miss Hazel Hernandez confssed to
Judge Conlan that her husband. Georgs
Raymond, had some provocation for his
disorderly conduct Last Friday night
in their apartment in a Keamy street
Iodginc-house- While "doing her turn"'
that evening en the stage cf a North
End vaudeville theater she recognized
in the aud:en-:e a gentleman whom she
had fcnesm long before she married
George, a.r.1 when he caught her eye it
winked at him. After the performance
ehe found him awaiting her at the
stage door, and she allowed him to es
cort her home, as she desired to talk
over old times. G-ecrge witnessed both
the wink and the meeting, but she did
net realize he was angry until he en
tered the rocm about two minutes after
her arrival th'rre and began to upbraid
her. She "sassed back." of course, for
Â¦xhat other wesson than her tongue
has a woman to defend herself with.
unless it be her hatpins? Although she
had a hat pin in each hand when the
police, summoned by her screams, burst
open the door, she really did not intend
to puncture George, but merely tried
to frighten him. At any rate. George
should not have smashed the mirror
and torn up the photographs that em
bellished it. By that act of vandalism
he exposed a mean disposition, and she
did not care very much what the Judge
did with him.
To the apparent surprise of iliss
Hernandez both she and George were
pronounced guilty of peace disturb
ance and ordered to appear to-day for
sentence. As the yoan^ woman "was
departing from the courtroom she was
halted by Clerk "Jack" Rice, an ar
dent admirer of stage art. who asked
her if she considered herself as clever
a performer as 2Iaud Amber. Hiss
Hernandez mused a moment ere re
plying that if she possessed the op
portunities afforded Miss Amber she
would make that lady look like seven
cents at a bargain sale.
Jnd^e Corlan held Ausrrst Geber.

Clifford W. Anderson, a IT -year-old
lad. was the only witness whose testi
mony had not be*n beard before.
"J, fter the shooting I follo'ared Oeb^r." 1
said Master Anderses. "x:ntil he
looked at me and beyan monkeying
rrfth his grin, and then I sent cold feet

THERE is a general advance in values in California
counties as estimated by the county Assessors.
While all the returns arc not. in enough are avail
able for the year 1904 to show the growing prosperity of
the State. When all the Assessors' returns are in hand
they will make a collective showing that could be used
with advantage outside of California to inform inquirers'
concerning actual conditions. In the mountain and val
ley counties alike the Assessors find that there is more
taxable property than there was a year ago.
? In Siskiyou County, for instance, there is an advance in
the assessment roll of $1,150,000 as compared with the
roll for 1903. The increase in the total for Marin County
is $1,073,050, making a total of $13,004,435. The value of
Alameda County's property of all kinds is placed for as
sessment purposes at $108,240,403; Oakland is assessed
for $52,494,981; Berkeley' for $12,308,486; Alameda for
$12,232,700. The increase!in the total assessed value of
Alameda County is $3,884,600, and to . this should be
added at least $2,000,000 more ta represent the amount

"The sender wanted his money back

THE Interstate Commerce Commission has prepared
and distributed an abstract of its forthcoming six
teenth statistical report upon railroad construction,
capitalization and operation in the United' States for the
year ending June 30, 1903. Even culled as it is from a
volume which will comprise 700 pages of summarized
analysis, this abstract of the commission's report con
tains data of the highest significance to close students of
finance and the growth of industries.
A remarkable increase in the extent of mileage and the
capitalization of railroad property, seems to characterize
the growth of railroad interests during the year 1903.
According to the report of the commission no year since
1890 has witnessed the extension of the steel lines into
new fields such as has been made during the last fiscal
year. The total single track railroad mileage for the
year of the report was 207,977.22 miles, an increase of
55O5-37 miles over the new construction of the previous
year. Of the total number of track miles operated by
the 2078 railroad corporations noted in the report, 1185
only were conducted under receiverships.
The par value of railroad capital outstanding at the
time of their investigations the committee found to be
$12,599,990,258, which represents a capitalization of
$63,186 per mile for all railroads in the country. Of the
dividend, paying stock the total accretion of gain for
the year is represented by $196,728,176, an increase of
$n>337>52i. This advance in the producing power of
railroad stocks represents an increase in the net earn
ings of $33J76,535 over those of 1902. A convincing
gauge of railroad prosperity is this.
But with all this marked heaping up of values, exten
sion of systems and garnering of high returns, the grim
roster of death that overshadows this giant industry in
its workings continues to grow .apace. For every added
dollar, for every new mile of track, it would seem that
human weakness and fated decree combine to bloody the
rails that yield this ever increasing increment of wealth.
For the year of the commission's report 9840 killed and
76,553 injured, represent the dole paid to death. Of those
killed or maimed near a half were the employes of the
railroads themselves â one in every 364 was killed and
one in every 22 injured.
A record such as that adds confirmation to the fact
that this, of all our great industries, is the most prodigal
of human /life. Yet of all the country's activities none
show a greater prosperity or occupy a stronger place in
the list of the absolute necessities of modern life. Must
it ever be that for this commodity we must pay an an
nual tribute in human life? Let the railroads take coun
sel how they may divert some of the gains that pour
into their coffers to the purpose of safeguards, both hu
man and mechanical, against th^dangers threatening
those whom they serve.

A brand new use for the automo
bile has been developed in an English
dairy country. This Is a motor wag
on equipped to constitute a traveling
creamery. The farmers instead of
hauling their milk to a central cream
ery have the motor wagon stop at
their gates on its dally round. The
driving power Is utilized for the oper
ation of separators, so that the skim
milk is returned to the farmer for
stock feeding and fattening purposes.
It is proposed to extend the facilities
of the traveling equipment so that the
butter fata may be replaced with
other cheaper fats, thereby rendering
the skim milk suitable for calves or
young pigs. Recent experiments have
shown that if butter fat or whole
milk is replaced with some other ani
mal fat the modified or blended milk
Is Just as satisfactory for raising
young animals as the milk of their
mothers. A combination of this kind â
that is, a traveling separator plant,
combined with an emulsor for blend
ing fat with skim milk â would do
much to revolutionize the present sta
tus of dairy work.

That an American author, if only

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CAUL,,
5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON, July 15. â It is
rather doubtful if there is another
poet who can boast of as ro
mantic a career as v that of
Colun Wallace, who at the age of
108 is now living and writing in a
modest cottage in Oughterard in
County Galway. Ireland. Probably
Colun Wallace is absolutely unknown
in the United States â he is practically
so in this country â but. in his own
land his reputation as a verse writer
is no mean one and a new collection
of his poems has just been published
lÂ»y the Gaelic League in Dublin. Wal
lace was born in 1796 and for almost
a hundred years mÂ«de his living as a
mason and a sawyer in various parts
of Ireland, writing poetry' in spare
moments. He married twice, but
about three years ago his second wife
died and soon afterward Wallace's
lack of means obliged him to enter
the poorhouse at Oughterard. It -was
seme months before the poet's readers
discovered where he was, but when
they did a fund was raided for his
benefit, as a result of which Wallace
Â¦was provided with a cottage, which
he now Occupies, as well as money
enough to h.elp him through his de
clining years. He -is now in splendid
health and spirits and -wrote an intro
ductory poem the other day for the
new volume -of his verse. Perhaps
the most striking* Hem of this collec
tion is a poem which Wallace calls
"The Song of Tea?' If is. a dialogue,
spoken by a husband -and wife, while
they are picking potatoes, as to the
relative merits of tobacco and tea to
the excessive use of - : which they are
respectively addicted.

The engineer remained still silent.
The sailor approached him and re
peated, "You have been wounded, sir!"
The engineer turned his head and
said: "I? Oh, no."
"Yes, sir; your breast."
"My breast?"
He touched his brÂ«ist and saw his
hand stained with blood.
Soon after there came the officer
who was to relieve the wounded engi
neer and he was accordingly made to
to retire into the officers' room.
"Am I to be treated as a wounded
man when the wound gave me no
pain?" he exclaimed with indignation.
A while ago a second torpedo which
the Russian warship sent out struck
the Ill-fated transport Kinsu Maru
near the engine-room and split her in
two. Sergeant Okano, who had his mus
ket leveled at the enemy all the time,
and continued firing, seeing that his
ship was sinking, dropped down on
deck in despair and exclaimed, "All is
over!" The next moment he un
sheathed his sword, and holding It with
its point against him, cut himself in
the stomach crosswise. "How shame
ful of you to destroy an unarmed
transport! You, cowards of Russian
wretches! Now, look and see how a
Japanese fighter meets his death," he
exclaimed.
The Susanaml succeeded in captur
ing the Russian destroyer Steregchiti.
She dispatched some of her crew to
the captured vessel to have our battle
ship flag hoisted on board and bring
her near the coast. But as the sea
began to rise higher and higher, the
tugging cord was cut off and the poor
ship began to sink. The captain of
the Susanaml said to himself: "The
ship may be allowed to sink, butâ not
our naval flag, never!" He sent a
boat to fetch the flag back to him.
The following letter was written by
Katsutaro Tsuchida to Lieutenant Sai
to, entreating to be put among the
members on the occasion of the second
sealing of Port Arthur:
The engineer seemed not to hear the
remark. "Your honor, you are
wounded!"
A fragment of the shell flew past
the breast of Yasuo Minamisawa,
third-class engineer of the Kasumi.
The blood instantly began to flow. But
the engineer was too intent on his
duties to become conscious of the
wound. He was deaf to the rolling
sound of the guns. Nor did he notice
the shells bursting close to him. All
that made him suspect something was
wrong was the temporary tremors of
his hand and a little choking sensation
he experienced at the moment. After
a while a sailor noticed his wound and
cried:
"What? Look! You are struck!"
The third-class bluejacket Koma
Shinowara of the Fuji, a youth of 22
years, was serving as an aid de camp
to the chief gunner, having stood in
the front bridge. A shell came whist
ling and carried his right hand off.
The young sailor, however, stood calm,
stopping the gushing blood with his left
hand. "I am wounded as you see," he
said, seeing his superior "officer ap
proach him. "May I leave my post?"
he asked quietly. He saluted his chief,
raising his left hand, and quietly
walked down.
The following little stories of
bravery, taken from Yune Noguchi's
translation for the Boston Transcript,
show the little brown man's hardihood
in the face of death:
In the hot battle outside the south
gate of Chongju, Sergeant Sato made
a dash and got his foot struck by the
enemy's bullet "Yarrareta" (I was
hit), he exclaimed. But he pushed his
way, Baying: "As long as my eyes can
see â what does it matter? â I shall
never be beaten by any Russian."
There was the bustle of men and
the tramping of horses. A party of
"red-capped" Imperial Guards are now
on their way to the front. They all
had their waterproof fur coats rolled
up tightly and fastened them on their
knapsacks and carried on their backs
shovel-like things, together with sev
eral other implements of war. Their
swords and muskets were bright with
careful burnishing. They were in
splendid martial array. Dear soldiers!
Oh, what proportion of these fighters
would be fortunate enough to come
back safely with laurels of victory!
They are hastening to their graves,
truly. But they marched, talking
quietly and laughing sweetly. Now,
from the second story of a beef shop
an attractive girl of about 18 or 19
leaned over the rail and 1 watched
them. When they came right before
the shop every one of them looked up
and stared at her at once and passed
on, whispering something. The girl
never took her eyes off the soldiers
and 'kept casting her flirting smiles at
them. One of the soldiers suddenly
turned up his face toward the girl
and exclaimed, "No more flirtation, my
dear lassie! Oh, no, none of your
jokes!"
Where Death Stalks.
"I am very much obliged to ye,
young man. Ye see. it wasn't for me
self I was asking. I just wanted to
know how much Mrs. McFadden was
mortgaged forâ her that puts on so
many airs with her neighbors." And
the Hibernian softly chuckled as he
took himself off.
He was an elderly son of the Emer
ald Isle who entered the office of the
Board of Supervisors and, addressing
Chief Assistant Clerk John Behan, re
quested permission to look at the as
sessment books. Behan informed him
that the books had been closed by the
Board of Equalization on Monday after
acting on all applications for reduc
tions.
The Irishman appeared disappointed
and then asked Behan to procure for
him the assessment figures on property
owned by a certain Mrs. McFadden,
and Behan volunteered ,to obtain
the data. Behan then looked the
matter up and found that Mrs.
McFadden -was assessed as fol
lows: Real estate $2000, improvements
$2100, with a mortgage of $1500 on the
property. Behan duly conveyed the in
formation to his inquirer, who thanked
him In these words: .
Her Rating.
THE tendency of modern civilizationyis to mitigate
the horrors and misfortunes of war and to limit
its destructive effects to as narrow a field as pos
sible. To this end it has come to almost be written into
international law that free ships make free goods on the
high seas. Belligerents may prey upon the Commerce
of each other wherever they frnd it, but a neutralflag
protects a cargo. If one belligerent wish to destroy
the commercial intercourse of the^ther it must be 'done
by efficient blockade of seaports, of which all the world
must have notice. We used the blockade quite effectively
on the Confederate seaports during the Civil War and
it has been applied as an instrument of warfare from
time to time since. It was used with considerable ef
fect to bring Venezuela to her senses by the concerted
powers which had to interfere in behalf of their na
tionals. It is recognized as a civilized process and all
the nations require that it shall be actual and not merely
constructive.
It keeps the martial issue entirely between the nations
party thereto and leaves the high seas free to neutral
ships. Freedom of the seas has always been insisted
upon by the United States. The Old World had recog
nized the right of search and seizure on deep water.
During the Napoleonic wars Great Britain claimed this
right and exercised it to the injury of our merchant
fleet and our commerce. For this we fought the war of
1812. The American slogan in thaj struggle was "Free
trade and sailors' rights." This did not mean what after
ward became known as "free trade" in an economic and
revenue sense. It meant freedom of the seas for trade
as against the taking of neutral ships as prizes. We won
our contention in battle, but strangely enough the treaty
of peace makes no reference to the issue that caused
the war. Great Britain entered into no formal conven
tion to give up the seizure and search of our ships on
the high seas, but she did give it up, and on that subject
there has been amity between the two nations ever
since. We followed this up by ridding the Mediter
ranean of the Algerine corsairs by banishing the pirates
of Tripoli, and it will be seen that American influence is
solely responsible for the advance made by the world
in respect to freedom of the seas. The wisdom of our
policy in that respect has become more apparent since
the importance to us of the Pacific Ocean was disclosed
by the Spanish war. We are the only great commercial
nation with a water front on that ocean and we are
vitally concerned in the freedorri of its waters.
Since the war of 1812 Great Britain has sought and
attained primacy in her merchant marine. Her ships
are everywhere afloat and for a half century she has
spared no pains nor expense to maintain a navy adequate
for the protection of her merchantmen. The patriotism
of her people has sustained them in all sacrifices neces
sary to maintain her sea power. As her Indian empire
took form she safeguarded access to it in every way.
For that she fortified Gibraltar and Malta and for that
she bottled the Russian fleets in the Black Sea and
turned the Mediterranean into a British lake. Later on
she bought the majority of the stock in the Suez canal,
giving her a short all water route to India. . So strong
has been the British sense of primacy of the water from
Gibraltar to the Straits Settlements that when- Sir Ed
win Arnold wrote his interesting book, "India Revisited,"
the title to the chapter descriptive of the voyage from
Liverpool to Bombay was "On the Queen's Highway."
He described the waters from the Mersey to Gibraltar
and thence to Aden and thence through the Indian Ocean
as British waters, the highway of the empire, for the use
of her Majesty's fleets and the British commerce. Sir Ed
win Arnold in this expressed British sentiment and feel
ing. Now that highway is invaded. Russia has sent
auxiliary ships out of the Black Sea and through the
Dardanelles under a merchant flag and has armed them
with sea artillery to prey upon neutral ships that pass by
the "Queen's highway." No more stinging blow was
ever dealt at British pride nor, since the days of Captain
Kidd, none more dangerous to all commerce. It is
obviously intended by Russia to specifically affront Great
Britain, for French ships plying to the Indo-Chinese pos
sessions of France have not been disturbed, while Brit
ish ships flying the flag of the same line on which Sir
Edwin Arnold sailed the "Queen's highway" have been
made prizes, their crews prisoners and their passengers
subjected to brutality and humiliation. We fought Eng
land for less cause in 1812. What will she do? Her
people will not bear the exactions necessary to keep up
a. navy unless they see results, and it is justifiable Eng
lish opinion that the navy is for just such occasions as
this. Russia has announced that her course in the
Pacific will be the same as she has followed in the Red
Sea. This means that she proposes to pirate the com
merce of Great Britain and the United States and forbid
our flag the freedom of the high seas. If this be at
tempted no American will hesitate in demanding repara
tion. It is the same issue we fought for in 1812 when we
were a young and weak nation. Now we are strong, ex
perienced and armed. The Pacific is Uncle Sam's high
way and he proposes to travel his own road at will.

scssment. Sarr Benito County shows an increase of
$27,920 as compared with 1903, and a total value of
$6,261,885. {^vv
Yolo County has increased in taxable property $345,
692 in a year, and its total is $15,200,162. Placer County's
increase is $226,000; Nevada County's $57,010; Stanis
laus County's $1,492,930, with a total valuation for 1904
of- $14,287,952. The very large advance in Stanislaus is
due principally to the enhancing value of irrigated dis
tricts. The west side and eastern border grain VÂ» nds
are reduced for assessment. The increase in real estate
amounts to $1,214,955, in improvements to $102,915, and
in personal property to $208,410. Tehama's assessment
amounts to $10,909,295, an increase of $320,070 from last
year. The assessment value of sheep and goats was
reduced ' in Tehama County. Had these animals been
estimated to be worth as much as they were assessed
for in 1903 the total increase of assessment would amount
to $500,000.
The decrease in Kern County, which amounts to $89,
163 as compared with the preceding roll, is accounted
for by the fact that the McKittrick branch railway is
not assessed'locally, but by the State board. The assess
ments on Kern County oil lands were reduced about
I2}4 per cent, and there is also noted a decrease in the
assessment of personal property. Modoc County prop
erty has been assessed for $4,023,045. In the county arc
275 miles of irrigating ditches that are assessed at $13,
610. Â¦ The increase in Trinity County amounts to $343,
841, the total assessment amounting, for 1904 to $1,991,
843. Mendocino County's assessment roll is more than
$1,000,000 lirfger than it was last year. The total valua
tion of $11,579,676 does not indicate the real value of the
county's resources, for there are 400 miles of railway that
are assessed on an average only $894 per mile.
These are but random notes taken from the returns
of county Assessors in a few counties. The complete
returns, when they are finally summarized, will consti
tute a fine official record of the advancement of this-
State in all material things in twelve months.

Then Mrs. Grace Lynch filed an in
junction against her husband Georjre
to restrain him frcrn disposing of his
salary and $10,000 worth of property
until he had agreed to pay her 1100
a month for separate maintenance,
which she needed, she said, because
she waa in "distressing- circum
stances." Lynch junior has returned
from England and the dismissal of
the two suit3 indicates that the dif
ferences have been settled.
Two notices of dismissal were filed
in the Superior Court yesterday of
suits which created, at the time of
their commeacernent, a passing sen
sation because of the unusual charges.
One of the actions was that of Grace
Lynch against E- and Alexander
Lynch. "E." being- her mother-in-law,
from whom, she demanded 520,000 for
bad treatment and deprivation of ner
husband's comfort and afTection. The
Lynches are En^iish and the bride of
their son said they made fun cf her
Americanisms, used hypnotism to win
her husband away and refrained from
teaching- the family parrot to speak ner
name in terms of endearment. The hus
band, shortly after their marriage,
Â¦went to England and the parent3-ln
law expressed the hope that he would
fall in love with a "nice girl" Â¦over

lowed almost immediately after he

ty-second. The horse shied at some
thing in the road and Hayes, beinsc
angry, dismounted and kicked the an
imal several times on the abdomen.
Just as a Southern Pacific train was
approaching the frightened animal
gave his head a sudden jerk, throwing
Hayes across the rails, where he waa
immediately mangled under the
wheels of the train.
The jury returned a -verdict that
Hayes* death waa the result of an ac
cident.

TACOMA, July 27. â In a fast game
the champions again outplayed Dug
dale's men, batting Roach when
hits were needed. Overall- was
effective, Beck's home run being
the only extra basehit made off
him. In the fifth Castro got a pass
and Overall tried to catch him at first.
Hcgan lost the ball and the runner
scored from third on Steelman's short
single. Eagan did the best batting,
getting a home run, a double and
single. The other runs were brought
in on timely batting by Lynch, Doyle,
Graham and Hogan, assisted by Mc-
Creedie's error in letting Hogan's hit
pass him. Dugdale tried out Shaw
from the Centralia team, but he was
replaced by Steelman, Shea going In
behind the bat. Drennan is still ill
and unable to play. Score:

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS,
i If the San Francisco ball team pos
i sessed a little more class It might win
against Seattle once in a while, but for
i the present, at least, there is no
chance. Any one who went to the
Eighth-street lot yesterday could see
that. It was an awful beating â even
/vorse in reality than it looks on paper.
Score 6 to 1.
Sir. Knell did the honors on the home
slab and he had nothing that the St
washes could not wallop. While the
walloping was in progress Mr. Knell's
supporters developed an erratic streak,
consequently the game was rent asun
der in a couple of innings.
Charlie Hall had 'em all swinging
their heads off and knocking up pop
flies chierty. It was lucky for the home
team that one run was eased ovvr.
This came on two errors and a hit in
the sixth round. Before an>l after that
time Uncle's collection never had a
look-in and they seemed to know It
only too well.
Seattle started by gathering in a run
in the second. Three more were added
in the third on good hitting. The big
sensation was pulled oft during round
four when Cy ToÂ»vnsend allowed Wil
son to land on his error. Then Hall
batted one out to right and Wilson
ran around as far as third.
Hall started for second on the throw
and Irwfn winged to Anderson to stop
him. Andys mitts were slippery and
the ball would not stop. Wilson came
in and after that one hit followed an
other till three registered in all and it
was settled for fair. The score:
San Francisco â Seattle â

Battling Nelson spent a quiet day at
his training quarters at Larkspur. He
took a long walk through Larkspur
Canyon in the morning and returned
perspiring freely. He spent the greater
part of the afternoon writing letters,
although he. was In the gymnasium for
a brief spell. Nelson will leave Lark
spur late to-morrow afternoon and will
go direct to the Baldwin Theater- to
weigh in. He will spend the remaining
few hours before the battle at a down
town hotel. Nelson's seconds will be
Ted Murphy, Frank Newhouse, Dan
Danzlger and Frank Rafael.
Toby Irwin will be the fourth man in
Hanlon's corner to-morrow night. The
others will be Billy Delaney, McDon
ald and Fred Landers. Irwin Is to
meet Jack Cordell In one of the pre
liminary events.
Hanlon took life easy yesterday tn
Alameda, going out for a stroll in the
morning and doing bag punching . in
the afternoon. He showed he had
force behind his swings by breaking
the fastenings of his punching bag
twice.
There is so much Hanlon money in
sight that the present odd3 of 10 to 7
will probably go to 10 to 6 before the
men enter the ring. Hanlon's admirers
are enthusiastic over his condition and
at the improvement he shows over his
previous form.
He has reached the "drying out"
stage in his preparation. He Is at
weight and to-day will do nothing but
take an easy five-mile walk after
breakfast and another shorter Journey
in the evening. Trainer Frank Mc-
Donald is thoroughly satisfied with
Hanlon's condition and those who havÂ»
watched Eddie in his work are well
pleased with the way McDonald has
fitted Eddie for to-morrow night's
event. Billy Delaney. the veteran
coacher of pugilists, regards McDonald
as the pick of the youns trainers and
asserts that if Hanlon adds Nelson's
scalp to his belt he will have much for
which to thank McDonald. Of the last
eight boxers McDonald has trained for
ring battles seven were returned win
ners.
The rival 130-pounders will weigh in
on the Baldwin Theater Btage, where
five hundred spectators can be accom
modated. The sale of seats commenced
yesterday and was satisfactory to the
club management.
In addition to the his fight there will
be two preliminaries of unusual merit.
Toby Irwin and Jack CordeU will meet
in what is scheduled for a flfteen-round
bout. Zubrick. an Eastern boxer, and
Kid Williams of Stockton will meet in
a ten-round affair. They, will weigh
about 145 pounds each. Williams has
beaten the Dixie Kid, which shows hlÂ»
class.
Billy Roach, the New York sporting
man. who is maktng his home here,
will referee the Hanlon-Nelson fight,
which will be held to-morrow night in
Woodward's Pavilion. His was the only
name mentioned, the representatives
of the boxers agreeing upon him at
once.

to knock McGovern out and the latter from the
severe punishment he was receiving.
Round 6 â Both boys came up quickly and

a left to tfie ear, but Neil only shook his head

PHILADELPHIA. July 27.â Frankie
Neil of San Francisco, bantam-weight
champion of the world, clearly out
fought Hughey McGovern of Brooklyn

The fight throughout was the most
vicious ever witnessed in Philadelphia
between little men. There was scarce
ly a second during the six rounds that
the boys were not in action. At the
closÂ«oÂ£ the sixth round McGovern was
almost out and was hanging on to Neil
to avoid punishment. McGovern drew
blood from the Californian's noae in
the second round and opened a gash
in his left cheek in the succeed
ing round. Neil cut a gash in
McGovern's cheek in the fifth
round. Toward the close of the round
McGovern was shaky on his feet. Neil's

named.
A high-weight handicap, a steeple
chase and the Holiday stakes for two
year-olds, selling allowances, were the
only events above the average.
A slight ripple stirred the placid
afternoon when the stewards were
called upon to decide whether J. L.
McGinnis was entitled to claim Duke
of Kendal or whether C. A. AInwick
should be awarded the horse. This was
after the third race, which was won
by Alnwick's Atwood, which easily de
feated Duke of Kendal,. Brooklynite
and others. The stewards decided in
favor of AInwick.
E. R. Thomas had starters In three
races and furnished the favorite in all
three. He succeeded In winning but
one. This was the Holiday stakes with
Voladay, and there were many spec
tators who declared it was partly due
to Hildebrand's rattle-headed ride of
Gold Ten that she was beaten and that
Voladay won. Gold Ten was off badly.
The pacemaker was that quick breaker,
Urush I'p. which was followed by Vola
day. To the amazement of critical on
lookers. Ilildebrand rushed his mount.
Gold Ten, up from six lengths
behind until he had caught
and passed Voladay and ran
lapped on Brush Up. Travers, on
Voladay. was content to take matters
easily all around the bend, but moved
his mount up gradually on the last
quarter.
Gold Ten left Brush Up at the head
of ihe stretch and ran on even terms
with Voladay for a short distance,
after which the Thomas colt gradually
drew away and won easily. Summary:

CHICAGO, July 27.â Judge Himes
finally found a track made to order for
him in the third race and feature event
at Havvthorne to-day and, although he
went up in the betting from even
money to 9 to 5 he simply made a show
of his field and won in a canter with
three lengths to spare. Bragg, the
past favorite at 6 to 5, backed from 2
to 1, was easily second, beating Huzzah
four lengths.:
The first race was run in a heavy
downpour of rain- and it was impossible
to distinguish one horse from another.
Despite the big field of fourteen start
ers the talent picked the right one in
Freesias, which was backed from 9 to
5 to 3 to 2 and won easily by a length.
The track was a sea of slop and the
heavy downpour of rain greatly affect
ed the attendance. There were no close
finishes, the winner in each event win
ning about as his rider pleased.
McChesney and Irene Lindsey were
shipped to Saratoga to-day to join
Smather's stable. Both are in the pink

amounts on the bank par porting to
be signed by Rogers or his wife.
Augusta Rogers.
Last Monday Carpenter called at
the bank and presented a check for
payment for 5175 purporting to tÂ»e
signed by Rogers. The bank had
been nfmfied of the previous forgenes
and when Carpenter saw that the
check was under suspicion he rushed
out of the bank, leaving the check.
It is said that the signature is a very
good imitation of Rogers' hand
writing.

Burke was released last night by
Detective Cody. Mrs. Andrews of 33
Lafayette street failed to identify hirn.
Burke was allowed to go to his room
on the condition that he present him
self to-day at the Hall of Justice in or
der that Mrs. Gushlacker of 1433 Stei
ner "street may have a chance to identi
fy him.
For the past two weeks an elderly
man has been passing 1 worthless checks
upon -women and obtaining from them
email sure* on various pretexts. One of
his schemes is to advertise for a house
keeper or female cook and call upon
the women answering the advertise
ment. He would tell them that h* was
on his way to the City Hall to pay his
taxes ard would ask them to advance
him S3, $4 or JS as. it struck his fancy,
and he would leave them & check for a
much larger amount as security, prom
ising to repay the amount on his re
turn to employ them. In this way at
least thirty or forty women have been
victimized.
Another scheme was to call at a
lodging-house, engage a room and pay
the rent with a check, receiving the
change in coin. The check was worth
less. He had no particular bank and
seems to have a supply of blank checks
of all the banks in the city. He is also
prolific with names which Include
Â¦William King. William Wallace. Henry
J. Siems, Harry Bell and William-
Walker. All the women'3 descriptions
of the swindler correspond. He 13 a
short man about 50 years of age, gray
ish mustache and neatly dressed.
So many reports came into police
headquarters from his victims that
Chief Wittraan detailed Detective
Cody on the case. Cody inserted an
advertisement in the papers that a
young housekeeper wanted employ
ment and gave the address, 110 Sixth
street, where he engaged a room. Yes
terday morning a short elderly man
with a erayish mustache called in an
swer to the advertisement and Cody
placed him under arrest. He denied

The trial of the suit of B. M. Eisner
against Miss Flora Lewis, by whom he
was jilted for the return oCa diamond
engagement % ring and othei sifts pre
sented to her in anticipation of their
prospective marriage, was begun yes
terday in Justice of the Peace Daniels*
court.
Eisner was the only witneâ¬S of the
day and he told hi3 side of the case
in precise language and with close at
tention to the smallest details. Eisner j
told how he and Miss Lewis became
engaged in April. 1903. and he Imme
diately presented her with a diamond
ring- which cost him $105. Later he gave
her three steins valued at Jia and made
her other sifts besides.
"The first intimation I had that Miss j
Lewis desired to break our engage- j
menu" testified Eisner, "wa3 when I â¢
learned In April. 1304. that the presents ,
which had been made to us by our
relatives and mutual friends in honor
of our engagement were returned by
Miss Lewis. Then she sent out notices \
to friends informing them that our en- |
gagement had been broken. I did not j
receive my own presents back, however,
and I did not consider our engagement J
at an end since she did not return thej
engagement ring."
On April 15 Eisner sent hl3 brother to
Mln Lewis asking her to give him the r
ring, but she refused. In fact she has ;
filed an answer that she never received !
any ring. The trial went over until |
to-day, when Eisner will be cross-ex-!
amlned and Miss Lewis will tell herj
story.

SAN DIEGO, July 27.â A remittitur
from the Supreme Court in the vac
cination case has reached the County
Clerk," affirming the decision of the
lower court that the vaccination law Is
constitutional. "W. D. French brought
suit because his four children had be-n
excluded from the schools on account
c-f not being vaccinated. The lower
court sustained. the action of the board
and the teacher and the case was ap
pealed. ; .
SAN JOSE, July 27.â The Ix>s Gatos
Board of Trade objects to San Jose
claiming the lion's share of advertising
at the Santa Clara County exhibit. at
the St. Louis world's fair. Monday
night the Los Gatos Board of Trade
passed a resolution protesting against
San Jose appropriating the whole
credit for the county exhibit at the fair
and demanded the removal of the bis:
inscription, "San Jose," from such ex
hibit. In case this city refuses to re
move the sign the Los Gatons demand
that the $2000 received from the county
for the fair exhibit be returned to the
Supervisors.
Los Gatos people maintain that the
whole of Santa Clara. County contrib
uted the exhibits and funds to make
the display, and not San Jose alone,
and that the attempt of this city to
appropriate the credit is unjust to all
other portions of the county.
A division of the $2000 annually ap
propriated by the Supervisors for. ad
vertising the county is also demanded
by the Los Gatos Board of Trade.
Heretofore this sum in the whole has
been given to the San Jose Chamber of
Commerce. This they claim is county
funds, and- should be. divided equally
among the various Improvement clubs
and boards of trade in the county.
â¢ Whether the San Jose Chamber of
Commerce will remove the sign "San
Jose" , from the world's fair exhibit is
not known, but much interest attaches
to the controversy between the two
towns.

WEDNESDAY. JULY 27,
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
SWITCHMEN'S AUXILIARY.â The Grand
Lodge of Ladies Auxiliary to the Switchmen's
Union of North America yesterday filed artlclea
of incorporation with the County Clerk. ThÂ«
incorporators are Mrs. A. T. Davis Mrs. H. J.
Â¦Williams. Mrs. J. A. Sully, Mrs. E. L: White
and Mrs. F. T. Stoddard.
The report shows a reduction from
last year of fifteen locomotives. Aud
itor Williams said this number of lo
comotives had worn out and had been
sent to the scrap heap and when re
placed had been charged to the South
ern Pacific Company.
A reduction in all classes of rolling
stock is shown in the Central Pacific
reports, with a corresponding increase
charged to the Southern Pacific.
The increase in gross earnings over
those of 1003 is $414,3?2 SS.
The report of the South Pacific
Coast Railway shows a mileage of 96.16
miles valued at $277,250. The rolling
stock is valued at $182,975. The eross
earnings from operation were $758,233 48
and the operating expenses were $1.
213,084 64, leaving a deficit of $454.851 16.
The steamer's net earnings had reduced
this deficit to $436,59916, but other ex
penses, listed as funded debt $220,000,
Side lines aggregating 235.49 miles
come under the jurisdiction of the
board this year for the purposes of as
sessment, which were not assessed last
year. These are branches operating
wholly in one county but as part of the
general system, and under an opinion
recently gi\en by Attorney General
\Vebb, are to be assessed by the State
Board of Equalization instead of the
Assessors ol the counties in which the
branches are operated. In consequence
several counties will show availing off
in assessments, having lost these
branch roads.
The surolus en hand for the
system, in and out of the State? 011
June 30 >\ as $45,025,284 7iÂ», against $39,
268,8."0 11 for thÂ« same date in 1903. In
the statements presented to the boaru
there is nothing to show what the sur
plus as relates to that part of tin.
Southern Pacific within the State is.
Auditor Williams said the locomo
tive mileage had increased 7 per cent
and the train mileage had increased 13
per cent, which explained the increase
in operating expenses. While the gross
earnings had increased over those of
last year there had been corresponding
increase in the cost of making the new
mileage, as train crews had to be paid
for extra work performed, overtime for
these employes figuring largely in the
item of cost.
The assessment of the Central Pacific
Railroad Company was considered this
afternoon. The Central Pacific has
1122.06 miles of road in the State,
valued by the company at $10,000,00(3.
The rollins stock is valued at $3,367,
450. The gross earnings are given at
$10,595,383 34, and the expenses at
$7,393,834 &7, which includes $313,193 2'J
taxes. The interest on the funded
debt, accrued, is returned at $3,022,
488 90, and the net earnings are given
at $2,S17,945 37. I
There has been no increase in the
mileage of the main line, but an in
crease of 13.36 in sidings and spurs is
shorn.
SACRAMENTO, July 27.â The State
Board of Equalization to-day took up
the assessment of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company. The road this
year operates 238C.S4 miles of road 'in
the State, which with sidings and spurs
gives a total of 3279.57 miles. The val
uation of the entire roadbed, roadway
and rails is piven at $20,720,895 and the
rolling stock at $6,280,400. The total
gross earnings are returned at $24,339,
781 r,5, as against $21,574,712 37 the year
before, an increase of $2,765,069 18.
.The revenue for the year is divided
as follows: Passenger and freight,
$23,044,692 80; mail ind express, $S43,
546 13; miscellaneous, $451,542 62.
Against this the operating expenses
are given ut $15,024,291 55, taxes $711.
644 28.
Under the classification of "better
ments and additions" the company ac
counts for an expenditure of $3,381,
996 65, which gives a total expense ac
count of $19,117,933 48, leaving a profit
of $5,221,848 07 over the cost of actual
operation of the line.
The interest on the sinking debt fund
amounts to $4,905,022 13.

FOR WEDNESDAY.. JULY 27.
Rcceipts of Produce.
The boat with fresh supplies of deciduous
fruits from the Sonoma district arrived too
late for ' the . regular trade, and as a result
there were large quantities of desirable stock,
particularly of Peaches, still ' unsold at the
close. Receipts . from . other sections were
heavy, however, and, although trade was
active, both for local use and shipping ac
count, the market had a weak tone and prices
of most kinds Â¦ tended downward. " Bartlett
Pears in bulk were held steady by liberal pur
chasing for canning \ account, while fancy
wrapped stock dragged badly and prices were
barely steady. - Apricots Â¦ In small packages
were easier, as the previous high prices re
stricted trade and supplies were commencing
to accumulate. Loose stock was weak, as the
canners reduced their btds arid were indifferent
buyers, being ; too busy with Pears; Peaches
were In excessive supply and ruled weak, with
60c an extreme figure for the best shipping
stock in small boxes. Some extra fancy highly
colored Apples of the Red June variety were
selling at $1 50@l 65 per box. but the general
market was In bad shape, with $1 25 an ex
treme figure for the best Gravensteln3. Trashy
stock from Watsonvllle was plentiful and
dragged at - unsteady rates. Figs were easier
under increaned supplies, some of which ~ ar
rived - late. Plums and Melons showed ~ little
change, . while Grapes were exceedingly dull at
lower prices. - Blackberries continued to arrive
freely from SebastopQl and. prices ranged lower,
with ' the canners - buying at' 2c .'per, -pound,
about equivalent to $1 75 .per chest. The other
berries were In good request and steady. Cen
tral American Bananas were selling at nar
rower range but otherwise them was nothing
netv^to report In Tropical or Citrus fruits.

The low prices of Potatoes continued to at
tract trade and, although the receipts were
heavy, the market was pretty well cleaned up
at the close. Cheap grades of river Burbanks
in sack* are in fair request for shipment to
the Southwest, one or more cars being shipped
dally, and this movement keeps the market
steady for that class of goods. Salinas Bur
banks are quoted nominal, as available sup
plies are of poor quality and hard to dispose
of. The quotations for Red Onions are
omitted, as there are only a few sacks coming
In from day to day. Sllversklns rule weak
at the recently revised quotations.
The market was badly congested with To
matoes In large boxes from the river districts
and they were being pressed for sale at
sharply reduced rates. Small boxes from other
â¢sections were practically unsalable. String
and Wax Beans continued to arrive freely and
the canners were still buying the former at
the Inside quotation. Egg Plant. Green Pep
pers and Okra were plentiful and cheaper and
the other vegetables were generally weak.
Sweet Potatoes from Coachella were offering
at 5Â®Sc per pound and met with a fair sale.

Â¦'Howfiw. the business outlook is satisfac
tory. Evidently th!Â« country has turned its
back upon the period of extreme depression
m-fcich began in 1903, but no wild boom is in
sight, end none Is wanted. The country needs
a siow and substantial recovery, and this Is
all it is llkc-ly to get. Any attempt .to create
a spirit of unreasonable hopefulness in Wall
Â«rÂ«rt is sure to end in disappointment and
â¢if-'.&y. The stock market hereafter will pre
Â¦ent OEceftaat opportunities for quick in-and
nut transactions, ae the fluctuations will be
important and of frequent occurrence."
A Wall street financier Bays of the iron
and stw! trade: "In the iron trade a great
&e*l more has been made out of the Improve
ment than Ss Justified, apparently for the pur
pose el stimulating speculation In the eteel
iesue* A turn for the better has really ap
peared in the iron trade, and buyers arc
rather mor* willing to place orders since they
are convinced that the decline in iron has
ceaBed; but prices are still very low and the
volume of orders is far below the normal.
When bountiful crope become a certainty gen
eral trade will assume more activity, and the
railroad* may then tee their way to larger
purchmw* cf rails and rolling rtock; but that
will fhow In the last quarter of the year,
and not in the present quarter, although there
has certainly been sufficient improvement In
the Iron industry to warrant a more hopeful
feeling.

NEW YORK, July 27.â There was further
downward pressure of speculative liquidation
In the stock market to-day. The bear raids
upon prices were mostly made for the pur
pose of uncovering stop-loss orders on a con
siderable Bcale. Tbe fact was thus demon
etrated that large speculative holders are In
a vulnerable position and capable o f being
dislodged by declining prices. The sentimental
effect of the decline was in itself strong. The
action of United States Steel preferred was
watched with special interest, and its leader
ship of the market was a material factor In
deciding the tone of the market. The first
500 shares sold above last night's price, but
an immediate decline followed and was 'an
retrieved. This pointed to the fact that its
weakness was not due to any credence of the
rumors of a reduction in the preferred divi
dend, since the maintenance of the dividend
brought no rebuying from sellers of yesterday.
Speculative opinion was inclined to assume
that yesterday's selling was realizing and the
offerings to-day were believed to be of the
same character, as the dividend action and the
amount of the net earnings were so closely in
conformity with the published intimation.
With these doubts over the dividend for the
past quarter dissolved a new doubt Immediate
ly Eprang up a.t to the dividend for the cur
rent quarter. The record low level of unfilled
orders on hand reported by the directors and
the recognized f act that the third quarter of
the year is normally the smallest In the steel
business, gave rise to the skeptical attitude
toward stocks adopted In the day's trading.
A grave condition In the relations between the
Russian and British Governments depressed se
curities in London and Parle, and this was an
Influence on our own market. The first direct
effect on trade was looked for in the London
exchange market, which continued to hold
strong, leading to expectations of an Imme
diate outward movement of gold. A gold ex
port movement is invariably adverse to the
stock market. The excessive accumulation" of
reserves in New York banks at present does
not mitigate the usual effect upon speculative
sentiment. A good deal of attention was given
aleo to the â¢yosslbility of an Issue being raised
between the United States and Russian Gov
ernments should the Vladivostok ships en
counter any of the merchantmen in the Pacific
under the American flag. Repo-ts of setback
to the crop gained currency with tbe progress
of the decline in stocks. The few reports of
gross earnings of railroads for the third week
of July pointed to a poor average. Discour
agement at the Inability of the market to
withstand the selling and another pessimistic
review of the steel trade by the Iron Age led
to the late break, which carried prices to the
lowest and made the closing weak.

Bran continues very firm, with moderate re
ceipts. Hay Is still demoralized, with dealers
making strenuous efforts to clear their receipts
out of the railroad yards.' Arrivals were again
heavy yesterday, being 1172 tons. Including 103
cars.
The circular of Somers & Co. says:
"There has been an almost unprecedented
rush of Hay to' market during the past week,
the total amounting to 5CG0 tons,' an average
of close on to 1000 tons per day.
for the week preceding seemed exceedingly
heavy. 4800 tons, but this week's report puts
them far in the shade. To-day the tracks are
so congested that the railroad company could
side-track but ten cars, although, according to
all reports, there is a large amount -of Hay
across, the bay awaiting track room to be mar
keted. It can be readily understood that mat
ters are badly demoralized here. The con
sumers have been waiting for just such a time
as this, and even now seem indisposed to buy
at all freely, looking for a still further decline
In prices. Trade naturally Is quiet owing to
rather depressed conditions in wholesale lines,
and it eurely looks as though Hay will be
purchased more cheaply in two or three weeks
from now, for there is yet a large amount
to be marketed here during the next two
months. *
"A later report from the United States De
partment of Agriculture states that as a gen
eral summary "Hay has yielded an excellent
crop In all sections except the South. The
grain crop is reported far below the average
both In yield and quality, and. although prices
on all kinds of cereals are on the upward
grade, yet a marked decline with Hay is very
evident.* '
"We understand that already the Llvermoro
farmers have dropped their high figures a bit,
and If our market continues overcrowded there
will probably be a still further lowering all
around."

a fresh burst of bullish news at Liverpool and
the unsettled condition of the European polit
ical situation, the wheat market . here opened
strong. Initial quotations on September using
at %@9&c to ftS^c higher at SS%(@89^4c
From the start there was an active demand.
A sharp decline in consols, owing to the grave
aspect of affairs between England and Russia,
caused â¢ very strong wheat markets, and in
consequence foreigners were good buyers here.
There also was a better export demand for
wheat and â¢ flour. Further reports were re
ceived of additional less In wheat in the
Southwest, and advices from .the Northwest
were far from encouraging. Complaints of rust
were general. On . the whole the bulls had
everything their own way. and there was no
Eel ling of * lmoortance except by longs, who
took profits. Prices at one time reached yes
terday's closing figures on Buch realizing sales.
September sold oft to 8S%Â®S8%c. Thereafter,
however, the market advanced rapidly, with
only slight recessions.- Report* of threshing
returns from Missouri and Michigan were dis
appointing and cash markets everywhere
were exceptionally strong. , To cap the climax,
word was received from Kansas City that an
elevator man there had sold Kansas wheat to
go to California. The high point on Septem
ber-was reached at 9OV4c A slight reaction
occurred just' before the close, final figures on
September being at SOftigSSfte. V
As a result of the decided strength of wheat.
a firm feeling prevailed In the corn pit. Sep
tember opened HOVic higher at 40%@49%c.
sold between 49%Â©49%c and closed at 49%c.
There was a fair buying of oata by com
mission houses on the strength of wheat, but
offerings from pit traders were . oÂ£ sufficient
quantity to hold the market firm. September
closed at 33 %c. - -
Pending a settlement of the strike at the
dockyards, the crovision market was practi
cally lifeless. A small . demand from pit
traders, with only slight offerings, caused a
firm undertone:. September pork -and ribs each

The act passed by. the . Legislature
of 1901 regulating the compensation
of Justices of the Peace throughout
the State was declared invalid by the
Supreme Court yesterday. The law
was hot uniform in its operation in
that it allowed one official more than
another for an equal amount of work.
The measure is therefore held to be in
conflict with the constitutional pro
vision which says that the Legislature
shall fix the compensation of all of
ficers in proportion to their duties
Under the act of 1301 the Justices
of the Peace in a town with a popula
tion of less than 6000 could not get
the same amount in fees for an equal
amount. of work as the Justice of a
larger town. The suit was instituted
by Justice of the Peace Tucker of
Fresno County. He handled forty
criminal cases in' one month and put
In a bill for $120. the statutory fee be

.The act of 1901 provided that the
maximum amount of fees allowable
to Justices of the Peace in a jurisdic

should be $30. In a larger town the
same amount of work would have 'en

park to Union street and just as they
turned from Union to Stockton the wo
man made a parting remark and start
ed to walk away from her companion.
No one but Roth heard the words, but
they were the last the unfortunate wo
man ever uttered. The double crime
followed.
The relatives of the dead woman
claim never to have known that such
a man as. Roth existed. Her sister,
Miss Richards, said: "I never heard of
Roth, as any sister was very, secretive.
We, my mother and I,- knew that' she
was wayward, buV could .do nothing
with her. Until recently; she had been
employed in the country as a domestic,
but after her. return to this. city a few
weeks ago she had done [nothing."; '.,',
The eyewitnesses to the tragedy were
Mrs. Elizabeth Schneider, Virgil Copo
rano and Frank Masenghetti. :Mrs.
Schneider first , noticed the couple' in
Washington Square Park. They., .were
quarreling. They walked from the

Roth 1 was a native of Switzerland, 54
years of age. He possessed a knowl
edge of the French language. He must
have come to this country in his youth,
for papers found in his trunk show that
he was discharged from the - hospital
corps of the United States army- in
1875. , In the room he occupied' were
found- a number of lewd photographs,"
and a stack of unused Chinese lottery
tickets, Roth, besides teaching Eng
lish to new arrivals from 'France.' added
to his income by escorting ''blind" beg
gars to and from the. corners where
they stand and "sell" pencils And-shoe
strings.- 'Neighbors say thatfjtvwas np
uncommon thing.;to see :Mrs..-Parslow
and' Roth enter Roth's home under the,
influence of. liquor and they were con
tinually quarreling.' .
Mrs.' Parslow was a widow, her hus
band, who had been employed as "- a
laborer by the Market Street Railway,
dying about two years ago. -She' was
a Mexican of good appearance.
WOMAN WAS WAYWARD.
SISTER PASSES BY.
The cause of the quarrel which
ended in the death of two people is
unknown. Ever since the â¢ death ' of
Mrs. Parslow's husband two years ago
she has been keeping company with
Roth and frequently visited his room.
She was there until about midnight
Tuesday. Persons occupying adjoin
ing rooms say the two were under. the
influence of' liquor and were quarrel
ing'until the woman went to her
home. At 9:30 this, morning the two
met in Washington square, near the
woman's house, and renewed their
quarrel. They left the park and at
the doorway of Washington Square
Hall the man suddenly placed a revol
ver, which he had been carrying con
cealed in a. handkerchief, under the
right ear of the woman and fired. She
fell to the sidewalk and he then placed
the muzzle of the revolver to his fore
head and pulled the trigger. His hand
was trembling and he was highly ner
vous. The cartridge failed to explode
and, casting a last glance the
the woman, who lay writhing
at his feet in her death ag
ony, Roth again pulled the trig
ger and sent a bullet crashing through
his brain. Death in his case was in
stantaneous, but the woman lay gasp
ing for .several minutes. Dr. Bonino,
whose office is directly opposite the
place where the tragedy occurred,
hastened to the assistance of ,the
woman, but after examining the
wound he said she would live but a
few minutes.
Maddened with rage. Manuel Roth,
who styled himself a professbr of lan
guages, shot and almost instantly
killed Mrs. Angelina Parslow at Stock
ton and Union streets at 10 o'clock
yesterday morning. He then ended
his own life. Jealousy seems to be
the only possible motive for this
crime. Roth lived in a miserable
shack at 12 St. Charles place, a blind
alley running off Kearny street be
tween Pacific and Dupont. His victim
lived with her mother, Mrs. Richards,
at 614 Filbert street, a few blocks
distant.
The case of White was the first
called. The charges against him are j
reported to be that or cortduct unbe- }
coming an officer and a gentleman, and j
conduct prejudicial to good order and i
military discipline. He pleaded guilty.
and after a few moments' discussion
by members at the court, his case was
taken under advisement by the court,
and in charge of the bflicer of the day j
and a guard, he was escorted back to i
his temporary quarters at the Presidio.
Conway's case came next and was
conducted in open court. He pleaded
guilty to the charge of being absent
from the Dost of the Presidio without
leave. His counsel. Captain Harold B.
Fisk. made an eloquent plea on his
client's behalf for the clemency of the
court. This closed. Conway's case,
which was taken under advisement by
the court. An adjournment was then
taken until 2 o'clock when Smith's case
was called.
The accused officer declined the as
sistance of an attorney and handled
his own defense. The charges pre
ferred against him are practically sim
ilar to those charged against White.
So soon as he entered the courtroom
he challenged nearly every individual
member of the board. His challenges,
however, were not allowed and the
trial was resumed, with the full court
as originally named by the command
ing officer. \ ::--
The session was conducted with
closed doors. The following witnesses
were examined: Colonel Alfred C.
Markley, Captain Ulysses G. McAlex
ander, Captain Frederick W. Fuger,
Lieutenant Frank PL Curtis, air of the
Thirteenth Infantry, stationed at An- I
gel Island, who had more or less tes
timony to offer as to the extraordinary
doings of Lieutenant Smith in his Con
nection with the different orgies at that
place.. Miss Ruth Mahone, a domestic]
employed at Fort McDowell, also- was |
called to testify about seeing the |
"ladies of the orgy party" land at the j
Government dock.
At 5:30 the court adjourned until 10
o'clock this morning, when Lieutenant
Henry A. Hanigan, the officer who
burst open the door at , the height of
the orgy, will go on the stand to de
scribe the scene he witnessed there.
Lieutenant E. H. Tarbutton and sev
eral enlisted men will also testify.
White 'and Conway both pleaded
guilty to the charges. Smith started
a stubborn fight to refute the accu
sations brought against him.
The court convened at 10 o'clock
with the following personnel: Colonel
Charles Morris, Artillery Corps, presi
dent; Lieutenant Colonel George H.
Tomey, Medical Corps; Lieutenant
Robert H. Patterson, Coast Artillery;
Major Benjamin H. Randolph, Coast
Artillery; Major John P. Wisser, Coast
Artillery; Captain W. S. Alexander,
Coast Artillery; Captain. Samuel L.
Faison, Thirteenth Infantry; Captain
James M. Kennedy, Medical Depart
ment; Captain Charles H. Hunter,
Coast Artillery; Captain Frank E.
Bamford, Twenty-eighth Infantry;
Captain Francis P. Seviter, Twenty
eighth Infantry, and Captain John P.
Bradley, Fourteenth Infantry, judge
advocate. *
Three army officers were before a
court-martial at the Presidio yester
day, all to answer serious charges pre
ferred against them. Two of them.
Lieutenants William "W. White and
Charles F. Smith, were the principals
in the scandalous orgies which have
recently taken place at Angel Island,
while the third was Lieutenant Wylie
T. Conway, who is accused of absent
ing himself frum the post without per
mission. ...

COURT-MARTIAL
IN FULL BLAST
James Condrin, convicted of burg
lary by a jury in Judge Dunne's court,
appeared for sentence yesterday. The
Judge sentenced him to serve three
years In San Quentin. On April 6 he
entered the residence of Jacob "Bock
at 219 Haight street by using: a lad
der and stole a large quantity x\l
clothing.
Sentenced for Burjrlary.
When questioned Raymond gave
additional light to the story told by
Mulick regarding the boy's removal
from the" home of S. S. Storey on the
Sunday evening after he was spirited
away from home. He said that after
Mulick took him from the house- they
were met on the sidewalk by a man
named Smith, to whom Mulick spoke.
Smith took the boy to his home and
kept him there until yesterday. The
man, his wife and two children com
posed the family. The boy could not
or would not tell where they lived.
â¢In the stories of the cruelties of the
Mulicks to their charges corroboration
was afforded by the statement of Mrs.
Lewis, who said that she was fre
quently beaten and even now carries
the scars of a rope lashing applied. to
her bare back. Roy Lewis, the younger
son, says that when he and his broth
ed did something demanding punish
ment the whilom grandparents would
fill their mouths with red pepper.
"I know about that some day," re
torted the boy; "it will never come."
Duffy held up the pleasures of life
with a younger brother as a playmate
and said that the father would teach
Raymond to swim. "Why, your lit
tle brother knows how to swim," said
the bailiff. "No, hedon't, and I know
he don't know how "to swim," was the
lad's rejoinder. The case commenced
to look hopeless for parents and
peacemakers when the lad, under pro
test, agreed to accompany his father
and mother across the bay.
HOW HE WAS HIDDEN.
He walked straight to the Judge's
side and Davis said, 'Mrs. Lewis,
â¢come take your boy." The mother
rushed eagerly forward, but the lad
shrank from her and wailed, "No, no,
I don't want her; I want to go to my
grandma." Mulick sat immobile.
Mrs. Lewis burst into tears and the at
torney called upon the father to come
and take the boy. The youngster also
refused to have anything to do with
his paternal parent and was deaf to
his entreaties.
Judge Kerrigan withdrew into his
chambers and Court Clerk John B.
Reilly and Bailiff Neil Duffy, together
with the attorneys, newspaper mer.
and spectators attempted to show the
boy that the order of the court was
for his own good. He was obdurate
and resentful. To his father he said,
"I don't want to go with you; 1 know
how it will be; in a week I'll get a.
licking." The father promised that
the boy would never be whipped by
him. Then the youngster said that
he wanted to see his grandmother.
Lewis said, "I'll take you to see her
some dav."
REJECTED MOTHER.
Raymond Henry Lewis, 12. years of
age, wept bitterly and cried insistent
ly that he wanted to "stay with grand
ma," who is Mrs. Lizzie Mullck, and
who, it was proved, is no relation to
the boy, although for thirty years she
has passed as the mother of Mrs.
Lewis, an actress, the boy's mother.
Two weeks ago when Mrs. Lewis
wanted to take her son to' Alameda
for a two weeks' outing the youngster
suddenly disappeared. It was brought
to light that Mrs. Mulick had taken
Mrs. Lewis from an orphan asylum in
1872. This disclosure and the pur
pose of the Mulicks to Â¦ keep the boy,
who had lived with them since baby
hood, determined the parents to apply
to the courts for his possession,, and
habeas 'corpus proceedings were com
menced by Attorney Henry H. Davis.
Mrs. Mullck and her, husband, Wil
liam, both declared under oath that
they had nothing to do with spiriting
the child away and did not know
where he was. Judge Kerrigan did
not believe them and ordered Mulick
to produce the boy in. court at 11:30
yesterday morning . under penalty of
punishment to be made for kidnap
ing.
Mulick was a little late, but he
brought the boy. The little fellow,
neatly dressed and strongly resem
bling his mother, sat beside the man he
had called "grandfather" until the
moment when Judge Kerrigan grant
ed the motion of Attorney Davis to
give the boy into the custody of his
parents. The lad was then called for
ward.
For a few minutes before the noon
hour yesterday Judge Kerrigan's
courtroom resounded with boyish
wails and the desk over which judi
cial mandates are passed daily was
splaeh'ed with the tears of a lad who
resented the court's order giving him
into the custody of his father and
mother.
