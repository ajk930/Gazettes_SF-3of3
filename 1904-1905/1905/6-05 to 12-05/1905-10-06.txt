Plot Against Rock
efeller Revealed
by Crowe.
Kidnaper Spurred by
Hope of Obtaining
$2,000,000.
His Accomplice in Venture
Overcome by Fear at
Last Moment
BUTTE, Mont., Oct. 5. â "Pat" Crowe
supplied another sensation to-day when
he declared that out for the tears of
Lib partner be would, have kidnaped
John It. Kockefeiitr aad'TiSHTtnimT^T 1*"1 *"
$^,Â«00,tÂ»00 rinsom. Crowe expressed
ccnsicerable regret that .he was unable
to carry oat his bold scheme, as he
declared that had he been successful he
\u25a0would have been a million dollars bet
ter off to-day aud .in . some foreign
country instead of the Butte jaiL
Crowe says the daring plot was
hatched in Chicago after an investiga
tion of Rockefeller's residence in Cleve
land. When everything: was ready his
partner got "cold feet."
Captain of Detectives Henry Dunn
and Cfiicer Henry Haitzend of Omaha,
accompanied by several Omaha news
paper men, reached Butte this after
noon and identified Crowe. The recog
nition was mutual. They will leave for
Omaha on Saturday night, securing
Governor Toole's signature' to their
requisition to-morrow. Despite Crowe's
assertion of his willingness to accom
pany them without a requisition, Cap
tain Dunn says he will take no chances
w*4.h Crowe, who will be heavily
manacled en route to Omaha. ,
Curious crowds filled the Jail to-day,
anxious to see Crowe. Photographs of
Crowe were published this morning and
had the effect of bringing out a num
ber of women, many of them carrying
fruit and bouquets to the prisoner.
"If my partner had not got 'cold
feet." said Crowe, in his confession,
"we would have made two millions out
cf the deal soon after that dirty trick.
I had planned to kidnap old Rockefeller
and get the son to give me $2,000,000 as
a ransom.
â¢*It was immediately after the Cudahy
affair that my partner and I â never
mind his name â were lying low in Chi
cago, laughing at the excitement over
the Cudahy kidnaping. It was so easy
that I suggested we go after bigger
game and the result was that within
a week. we took the train to Cleveland
to kidnap old Rockefeller and get the
b:g L-tmch rrom the* boy.
""Well, we got down there, went out
to his place at Forest Hill, six miles
east of Cleveland, and sized up the
place. It was dead easy. The old man
was there. It is a quiet, country place.
It was a snap, I tell you. We planned
to hold up the watchmen, gag them and
get into the house at night. ~We had a
plan of the entire place. - We fixed it
to hustle the old mac into a rig and
make the young fellow dig up. -You
bet he would have come there so fast
it would make your head swim. ;
"TVe fixed the thing for a Wednesday
night. At abcut 6 o'clock my partner
paid he was not' feeling well and he asked
me to put it off till the next -night. Well,
I put it off and at* noon the next day.
Thursday, he broke down and said he
thought we were being watched 'right
then. That settled it I began to fear
he was going to give the whole snap
away about the Cudahy affair, so I lit
out / for New York and from there to
South Africa, and that was all there was ,
to it.
"Rockefeller is holding -up the world
and petting his ransom, too," he added.
â¢\u25a0Why shouldn't I make him come across
if I have the chance?
'Tm not the originator of the ransom
business. Did you ever read any Roman
history? Caesar was the boss kidnaper of
the world. When he was running the
world he used to eend old Brutus and
seme of his general? over to Carthage;
grab one of the big kings in that coun
try and make, them put up several mil
lions before they gave him back. His
tory is full of the came. They call it
kidnaping nowadays; in those days it
was statecraft. -
"Rockefeller is the oldest kid I ever
had designs on, and if I only had a fellow
with me that would go the route., l would
have made John D. Jr. give me two. or
even three millions, " if I wanted it. if
1 once had the money, don't ' you ..worry
that' l would, ever be pinched for it ' The
Kockefellers ; would not miss it and I
would not be jumping sideways for a
meal :to-day. \u25a0
"Maybe," concluded Crowe with a sick
ly â¢mile, "I'll set Rocky yet'

Continued From Pagre 1, Column S.
though it had not begun lp break up,
it was pounding heavily at times. The
passengers were at no time alarmed af
ter the first shock of the early morning
when the majority were in their berths.
There was but little panic as the vessel
did not strike with a hard shock. The
officers soon restored order and it was
teen that there was no immediate danger.
The shore was spoken for assistance and
all settled down to wait for relief.
The St. Paul is ashore at nearly the
same point where the old steamship Hum
"boldt was lost several years ago. In that
case, too, the passengers were all saved,
but the vessel was a total loss, as the
Bt. Paul is likely to be. It is believed
the vessel's plight is partially due to the
heavy inshore current which pets off Point
Gorda at mis time of the year. AH mari
ners have complained of it. and a vessel
\u25a0once lost in the fog is fortunate, in
deed, if ehe succeeds in escaping it. Full
particulars of the mishap cannot bÂ«
learned until the arrival of the tug. No
one w*nt ashore at Petrolla, and but lit
tle of the conversation that was held be
tween the Petrolia people and those
aboard the vessel can be learned, owing
to the poor telephone service.
It is extremely problematical how long
the St. Paul will be able to hold together.
Shipping men are not inclined to think
thye is much chance for salvage, as the
vessel lies in a position which makes it
impossible to reach her by anything but
email craft. The s*a is reported as gradu
ally becoming more smooth, but from ap
pearances a storm is brewing. In thai
event the St. Paul cannot long remain in
tact, as the coast at the Point is ex
tremely rough in anything but the best
'weather.
Upon striking the rocus the St. Paul
sounded whistles of distress, but owing to
the early '.our and absence of houses
along the coast some time -elapsed be
fore any one was aroused. When Charles
Benolij a rancher, appeared, he was greet
"Â«-<l-with cheers by the anxious passen
gers. It required some time to make Be
noli understand what was wanted, but
upon realizing the true state of affairs
ne left without delay. Another cheer fol
lowed him, for all knew it would be but
a lew hours at the most before a tug or
other craft would arrive in the vicinity.
The distance from the wreck to the town
of Petrolia is seven miles, and Benoli
walked and ran that distance in less than
an hour. He was greatly excited and sev
eral minutes elapsed before he could
make known the plight of the vessel and
then iie experienced trouble in reaching
, Eureka by telephone.
. Steps wtre then taken to guard against
emergency, it being* uncertain what
damage the vessel had sustained and how
long it would be possible for the passen
gers to stay aboard. Sailors embarking
in a sma.ll boat managed to get a hugre
hawser to !and and after securely fasten
ing it returned for another, which was
landed more easily.
. The passengers began collecting the
valuables and baggage at this stage. It
is doubtful, however, if much of the lat
ter could t>e taken by the tug. which has
limited accommodations and will be sore
ly taxed to handle the 109 passengers on
the St Paul.
It is reported that the officers, or at
least a portion of them, have stayed with
the vessel for the night, but it is thought
she will be abandoned to-morrow. A
steam schooner, believed to De the . oyo,
aided the Ranger in taking the passen
gers from the wrecked steamer.

WHO LOST THE GEORGE W. ELDER.
The San Francisco and Portland
Steamship Company's coaster St. Paut
left here at 11 o'clock Wednesday
morning for Portland. Or., with eighty
nine passengers on board. Her master
is Captain Clem Randall, who bears a
good reputation as a seaman and navi
gator. In the past he has proved him
self careful and Fkillfvjl. He has many
friends here and the news of -the dis
aster to his ship was received with
the greater regret on account of the
esteem in which the skipper is held.
The St. Paul was purchased by the
Harriman line from the Alaska. Com
mercial Company about a : year ago.
She was a comparatively new vessel,
and one of the best of her. class on the
coast. She was built in 1898 at ; the
Union Iron Works. She is a. vessel of
guns fired off shore to the northward.
A tb'ck fog prevailed at thn time and
It was feared that some vessel, might
be In distress. Inquiry at the various
army posts show* that no sruns were
flred by-Uncle Sam's men and a? far
as could be learned, yesterday- it was
only at tbe'< Cliff -House .that the firing
was noticed. ,- :'\u25a0. \u25a0'/\u25a0". :-
The fact of twelve runs having_ been
nred is takÂ«Â»u by shipping men us pretty
certain evidence that the shooting was
not from any vessel. Few ships, they
say, are provided with so many car
tridges, and few masters,. lf they had
the ammunition, would be so prodigal

PLAN TO WIPE OUT
TREASURY DEFICIT
WASHINGTON. Oct. s.â An elaborate
scheme for wiping out the treasury de
ficit and saddling the cost of construct
ing thÂ« Panama canal on posterity, has
been devised by members of the admin
istration. If the plan be carried out
by Congress the will once
more show a balance on the right: side
of the .ledger. ' : ; v' iv
The scheme is to create** separate
fund for the construction t of the canal,
to sell bonds and to return to the
treasury $50,000,000, which has-been
partly expended in ; securing the prop
erty of the canal and in pay
ing the Government. of Panama for the
right of way across the i Isthmus. Pres
ident Roosevelt, Secretary Taff and
some of the leading members of the
Senate consider . that it r would pot be
just for the present generation to : de
fray the entire expense of constructing
the canal.

TIDE AT POINT PEDRO WASHES IT ASHORE
. . . . , . TÂ» â¢ T-Â» 1 â¢ TXT 1 1 â¢ T ~ 111
A derelict submarine mine was washed up on the beach at rointredro, Wednesday. It was rolled
cur of the water by seven members of the First Regiment, N. G. G. The mine' is believed to be one
that escaped from the Golden Gate during practice. It is probably loaded with nothing more; dangerous
than sand. It has been drifting about in the Pacific Ocean for several weeks.
Contains Nothing
but a Load of
Sand.
Militiamen Knock
Off Cap With
Hammer.
A floating mine lost in the Golden Gate
during practice stranded on the beach
near Point Pedro Wednesday after drift
ing down the coast in the track of the
coasting steamers.
Had the thing been loaded with any
thing but sand It would have announced
its presence more audibly as it bumped
upon the rocks before it reached the
beach-
Seven members of the First Regiment
of Infantry, National Guard, who were
camping along the beach, rolled the thing
up ca the sand and took charge of it.
Xo details of how the monster escaped
could be obtained last night. There is
abcut thirty-five feet of wire cable at
tached to it. The cable appears to have
been cut on* by a sharp instrument. A
bit of Insulated wire by which the mine
could be exploded projects from the cap
on one end.
When the natlnoal guardsmen rolled
their find ashore they were sure that it
was a grim memento of the Russo-Japan
ese war. People driving that way came
down to the beach to see the find. When
they learned what it was they made quick
time to the nearest towns.
"Oh, let s open up the thing," suggest
ed Private William Reed.
This suggestion was acted upon im
mediately by the reckless youths.
Witli a hammer and an ax they began
to loosen the bolts that held the cap. One
of the bolts was obstinate and had the
mine oeen loaded there would be seven
Jess men at the next National Guard
muster and a hole in the earth where
Â» J oint Pedro Juts out into the sea.
The mine has probably been drifting for
several weeks. It was a worse menace
to navigation while afloat than any hid
rock or derelict, for It was low in
thf- water and hard to make out.
The mine was first seen Monday by sev
eral cf the militia men. It was bobbing
around in the tide and looked like a small
boat turned bottom up. Several small
coasting vessels steamed close to the
ihiTig.
It drifted close to the shore Wednes
day afternoon and the national guards
man waded out and rolled the heavy
cylinder u> on the sand. They handled
it gincerly at first, but curiosity drove
them to Investigate. With a hammer and
an ax they loosened the bolts that held
the cap oa one end. They handled their
tools recklessly and soon the cap was
off. revealing a copper wire fuse that
connected with the powerful explosives in
the interior of the steel shelL
A large bolt firmly fastened prevented
them from carrying their investigation
any further.
The mine is about seven feet long and
three and a half feet in diameter. The
only marks of identification on it Is the
number 22, on one of the ring bolts. It
had evidently been in the water some
little time, as there were clusters of bar- !
nacles on It.
The men who rolled the deadly steel
tube ashore and handled it so familiarly
are \\llliani Reed, Company E; P. V.
Kelly, Company H; Sergeant George
Hershinger, Company H; Sergeant J. I.
Mackin, Company C; Lucien Boudln* >
Company H; H. Doherty, Company P;
P. Fischer. Company E, and Louis List
man, mascot, aged 8.
Fischer and Doherty went to town yes
terday and reported the find to the au
thorities. Chauncey St. John, head of the
Custom Bureau, sent out Lieutenant
Henry Gallagher and Inspector Dave
Lewis. They arrived at the beach Just
before dark. Both agreed that it was a
stationary mine that had been cut from
its moorings.
When the mine was described to Cap
tain Harts of the Engineer Corps last
night, he said:
"That is unquestionably an American
mine and must have escaped during
drill at the entrance of the Golden Gate.
It would not be loaded with explosives
during drtlL It is probably loaded with
sand."

Iston, Me. The operation which resulted
In Miss Kelly's death was performed, she
said, by an East Boston physician, whom
she named, and the crime was committed
in a roadhou&e near Plaistow, N. H.
Kate Mayo says she nursed the girl and
after her death saw the doctor cut up
the body and later put the torso into a
suit case, wnich he gave to two young,
men, one of whom was Miss Kelly's
sweetheart, with instructions to take it to
Winthrop and throw it Into the harbor.
"I was sworn to secrecy," cried the
woman to-night, "and was to have been
paid $15 a week for silence. But the hor
rible story is gnawing at my heart. I
cannot keep quiet any longer. .
"The doctor is now in Saratoga. He
went there immediately after the deed.
The girl died from the effects of a sec
ond operation."
Detectlvts were hurried to - Lewlston
and Plaistow, where they are now con
ducting an investigation.
The woman is in a pitiable condition at
the Lowell police station and the police
have decided not to question her any
more until she has recovered. Chief Shaw
and Deputy Chief New refuse to say how
much faith they put in the woman's
story, but It Is pointed out that one of her
alleged characters might Â»iave been Just
the sort of a person most likely to be
selected to help in the revolting crime of
the' dress suit case.
Plaistow, N. H., is about ten miles from
Lowell, on a branch road, and Lowell is
twenty-six miles from Boston.

LEFT DESTITUTE
WITH HER CHILD
Mrs. W. A. vWooliever Says
Husband Has Deserted Her
for One He Liked Better
Mrs. "W. A. Woollever, a delicate little
woman who was deserted by her husband
for another aLout six weeks ago, is liv
ing in destitute circumstances with her
seven-year-old daughter, Irene, at the
home of Miss Clara Bergman, II Belcher
street. Miss Bergman ' r is giving them
shelter until Mrs. Wooliever can ob* tain
some kind of employment. Her husband
went from here to Selma, Fresno County,
and has not "*re turned:' ' '^'
It was first thought that Wooliever had
been the^victim of foul play, but he has
since been seen with a woman who has
been employed by him as an agent. It
is now believed that he is, living 'with this
woman somewhere in this city, but their
whereabouts have not yet been 'learned.
When seen~last evening Mrs.- Wooliever
cried bitterly ' and said she could hardly
believe that her husband would be guilty
of deserting her and their little daughter.
When informed that he had sold every
thing, even her personal effects, and had
left with another woman; she would not
believe it until she had positive proof that
he was" living in this city with, the
woman.
, The day after he had sold ' their prop
erty he sent, her a very affectionate let
ter and inclosed $10 & with . a promise to
send more as soon as ne could. - . .'
A part of the letter is written to his
little daughter, in which he says: "Here
Irene is a big hugand kiss for you and
one for your new dollie. Tom kissed your
two dollies here for. you and the 'big
dollie pinched Tom's tail for him until he
scratched her. Well, Irene, you must
learn all j you 'can, for learning is earn
ing. " Be a good girl to mamma and kiss
her for papa." :
At . the time this letter was written
hp had already made up his mind to
leave this pretty ; little girl to the ten
der mercies of such [ charitable people
as would give her food and shelter. *
'\u25a0'If I could only. get something to do,"
said Mrs. Wooliever yesterday, "I would
not feel so bad about it. I am " not
strong enough to do hard work, but am
capable of doing any kind of office
work, such as assistant bookkeeper or
anything in that line. I also under
stand dressmaking and would accept ,
any position to keep my little girl from
starving." ....
Misa Bergman, who Is a dressmaker,
says Mrs. Wooliever is very, handy with
a needle, and if she could only get. a
place she 'is confident she could keep it.
Mrs. Wooliever says her husband has
barely given her and her child enough
to live on ; for several months, and has
kept her In " the city by telling her he
expected to move here within the next
few weeks and it would only be.waste
of .money for r them to come to him.'
After the desertlon ; she applied; to; the
police ',, to make ! him â¢ support the child,
but was Informed she could not do any
thing until one year had passed.
, SELMA, Oct. 5.â W. a Wooliever,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Oct. s.â Through police
headquarters a world-wide alarm has
been sent out for Abraham Schlffer,
controlling owner in the silk firm of
Philgrim & Myer and part owner of the
Alamosa '% Bank of Alamcsa. Colo.,
which closed its doors a few days ago
after $250,000 of its funds were report
ed missing. Schifter left New York
last Thursday, ostensibly for Alamosa,
and has not been heard from since. He
did not reach his destination and tele
graph messages to various parts of the
country having failed to reach him, his
brother, Herman, fearing that he has
met with violence, to-day asked the
police to aid in finding him.
Isaac. Schiffer, another brother, was
Abraham's partner in the Western
bank. According to a statement made
at their office, they were interested to
the extent of 135,000 each. Their first
knowledge of trouble in the bank's
affairs came to them last week, when
it was reported that $70,000 had been
lost in some unknown manner. They
at once prepared to go to Alamosa,
Isaac starting first. He is there now.
Abraham .was unable to go until last
Thursday, on which day his brother.
Herman, accompanied him to Jersey
City, where he boarded a Pennsylvania
train. He had a through ticket for
Alamosa. -

was shot while in charge of the bank
at Alamosa. His wound was serious
and was inflicted by some 'unknown
person. At- that time Herman Schiffer
went West to.make a, thorough investi
gation, but he was unable to gain any
information that would lead to the ar
rest of the assailant.
Abraham Schiffer should have
reached Alamosa last Sunday morning.
From reports received in this city It
was learned he was not aboard the
train when It arrived there.

FUSION CAMPAIGN COMMITTEES NAMED TO CONDUCT
BATTLE FOR COMMON HONESTY IN CUTY AFFAIRS
Republicans Are Firmly United
in Support of Partridge.
Democratic Forces Are Also
Solid and Enthusiastic. It
The contest in the Republican ranks
for gubernatorial favor goes over until
after the municipal election. The post
ponement is satisfactory to every one con
cerned, and henceforth all Republicans
will devote their energy and enthusiasm
to the election of John S. Partridge. May
or of San Francisco. There Is also har
mony in the Democratic camp, hence the
prospect of victory for the cause of hon
es-ty in the management of municipal af
fairs is bright and growing brighter.
Ruef's candidate for Mayor, Eugene E.
Schmitz, is making speeches every night,
but is not making as good an impres
sion as he made two years ago. The talk \u25a0
about Citizens' Alliance is taken as. mere
twaddle by the public generally. In this
respect the Mayor's campaign to date is
a flat failure. Moreover, the liquor deal
. ers are not by any means solid for Rueffc
candidate. The "hold-ups" under the
Ruef administration have been too fre
quent and exacting. Legitimate dealers
have no desire to be classed politically or
In a business stnfie in the tame grade with
dive keepers and managers of disreputable
joints. The liquor men can vote as they
deem beet at the municipal election with
the assurance that Ruef and the police
cannot ascertain how they vote. In the
primary election they were obliged to
register thtir names and signify their
party affiliation. All the saloon-keepers
are not for Schmitz, but nearly all the
keepers of low resorts are mouthing the
praises of Ruef's Mayor.
Republican and Democratic campaign
committees were announced yesterday.
\u25a0.end joint committee organization will be
effected to-day at Republican headquar
ters. Next Tue&day evening at the Al
hambra Theater there will be a mass
: meeting of citizens to ratify the Fusion
ticket and listen to the utterances of
John S. Partridge, the leader in the cause
cf common honesty in administration of
' local government. Able speakers will pre
" sent the issue of the campaign In a style
that will startle the grafters and excite!
the applause of honest citizens. The great ;
opening demonstration will be followed by
district rallies throughout the city.
It is noted all along the line that the
courage of ihe grafters is oozing out
"While jhe leaders of graft do a deal of
boosting in public places, they do not
display the blatant confidence which they
exhibited en the eve of the primary elec
tion, when the Mayor's boss wagered
money and tiles that he would win every
Assembly district in the city. The tre
mendous silent vote polled jfor the Re
publican League candidates at the pri
mary surprised and utterly confused the
grafters. The eilent vote on November
7 will overthrow the legions of vice and
corruption in San Francisco. Citizens
who have resolved to do their duty are
not moving around and voicing their de
termination in the saloons and on the
street corners. I
Furthermore, the leaders in the cause
of clean governmentâ the men who have
been appointed to conduct the Fusion
campaignâ will have an honest election,
if the courts, sustained by a powerful
public sentiment in a just and righteous
cause, can administer justice. At this
time the EUction Commissioners are liv
ing in a fools' paradise. They imagine that
they have the power to withhold from the
public the names of men slated for duty
as precinct election officers, but some fine

NEW YOKIv, Oct. s.â Mayor George B.

ot twp years, the State Legislature haV
ing recently amended the city charter so
ah to provide for a four years* tenure of
office -for officials of Greater New York.
The Tammany convention was heid in
Carnegie Hall amid much enthusiasm.
The fact that tht entire ticket had.been
decided upon beforehand did not seem to.
diminish the ardo-r of the delegates'of the
live boroughs of the greater city. They
entered upon the work of ratifying the
Elate with much, earnestness. McClellan
was the oniy member of the present ad
ministration renominated, the ticket
named by the convention being as fol
lows:
Mayor, George B. Meridian of Manhat
tan.
Comptroller. Herman A. Meti of Brook
lyn.
President of the Board of Aldermen,
Patrick F. McGowan of Manhattan.
Metz is named to succeed Comptroller '
*K. M. Grout and McGowan jto succeed '
President Charles V. Fornes. Femes
presided at to-night's convention.
â¢ A resolution was adopted highly com
mending President Roosevelt for his
services in bringing about peace between
Russia and Japan.
Leader Charles F. Murphy of Tammany
Hall received ah uproarious welcome
wlien he walked into the convention hall,
â¢ the band playing "Tammany " and the
delegates cheering wildly. Senator Pat
rick H. McCarren, the Brooklyn leader,
also was accorded an ovation. â¢-\u25a0
Mayor McClellan was notified of his
: â¢ nomination - and appeared- in the hall
â¢ shortly after 11 o'clock. Again there was
ad enthusiastic demonstration.
Major McClellan in accepting the nom
ination declared he was pledged to no
n^i nor group of men; pledged only to
the people to do his duty to the best of
his ability.
The platform adopted touches on muni
cipal ownership and declares It has lopg
been accepted as a Democratic doctrine.
"Public ownership," It is asserted, "Is
no longer a campaign catchword, but a
principle applied and In operation in this,

DESERTING TAR
MAKES A DASH
Wrenches Iron Bar Off the
11. S. Marshal's Detention
lloom in Federal Building
Marcel V. o. Pastur, a desfrter from
the British ship Windsor , Park, made
a bold attempt yesterday morning to es
cape from the prisoners' room in the
new Government building at- the corner
Of Seventh and ,Missipn streets. He had
been held by United States Commissioner
Heacock on the charge of desertion, and
pending his transfer for Â»afe-keeping to
the county Jail .was placed into what is
ironically \u25a0 called the prisoners' room .in
the quarters of United States Marshal
John H. Shine.
The exits of this room are guard
ed by fancy' lgrlll work, which covers the
window opening on Seventh street and the
door opening on, the corridor, of the third
floor. The door has no keyhole on the
inside and fastens automatically ; with a
spring latch. While the iron grill pro
tects the. door on the corridor, side, it
can be opened from the inside by turn
ing the knob.. .Shortly*, after 19 o'clock
the sailor turned the knob, opened the
mahogany door, tao~ hold of one. of the
half-Inch bars of ~ the grill and wrenched
the bar from Its fastenings." The removal
of another bar would have made an
aperture large enooghto admit,. of-. his
escape, but. before he had tinls'hed the'job
Deputy^ United States Marshal George H.
Burnham came along and seized the
sailor. The prisoner, a strong active fel
low of twenty years, made a desperate
resistance, but Burnham sat upon him
and handcuffed his wrists together. Then
he took his prisoner to the corner of
Mission and Seventh streets and waited
for a trolley car to take him to jail.
Pastur was Impatient, and made a sud
den dash toward Sixth street, with Burn
ham in hot pursuit. The tar ran like a 1a 1
coyote, but Burnham, who had learned
footracing in the western foothills of the
Sierra, overtook him after a 200-yard
sprint and: Jtq Jitsued him 'into submis
sion. '"'\u25a0".*
The sailor said that "If he were "sent
back to the Windsor Park he would kill
the mate end set fire to* the ship.
Livingstone, the master,- laughed when'he
heard this threat/, and * said something
about putting Pastur upon cold? storage

THE "GRAFTERS"
Beclares Dishonesty in High
Places Threatens Future of
the American Nation
SITUATION IS CRITICAL
Believes. However, That the
Country Is Awakening to
Perils That Confront It
AXNAPOLIS. Md.. Oct. s.â Dishonesty
In high places in the State, the ju
diciary and great financial institutions
\u25a0and corporations and palliation of such
acts by the masses greatly threaten the
future of the country, according- to
views expressed to-day by J. Edward
Simmons, president of the Fourth Na
tional Bank of Xew York, in an address
before the Maryland Bankers' Associa
tion. He pointed to the lessons taught
by the fall of the ancient Roman re
public, the reign of terror in France
end the disasters which befell Russian
arms in the recent conflict In the Far
East, all of which, he said, were due to
palliated dishonesty.
"I hear voices from the East and
voices from the West," he said, "ill
boding voices, voices from the pulpit
and the divine, voices from the col
lege and the educator, voices from the
bench and the bar, voices from the
press and its sages, the voice of the
President himself, denouncing in ring
ing tones and deploring the universal
spread of selfishness In Its meanest and
most repulsive form â the form of dis
honesty. They bewail a universal car
nival of dishonesty. Alas! the voices
are not unconfirmed."
He deplored the conditions which
have led men to tolerate the terms
"graft" and "grafters" and said he
feared the very use of the words was
an indication of men's tolerance of a
thief and his trade. He called upon
the members of the association to give
their assistance in remedying a condi
tion which makes it possible "for men
\u25a0who pose as the salt of the earth and
who condemn, without reserve, those
who steal $50 or forge a check for a
hundred dollars, or accept a bribe,
who themselves make millions by lying,
by misrepresentation, by'fraud and by
bribery," without receiving- punishment
or even criticism, while the man who
steals the paltry sum is sent to jail.
He denounced the man of stainless pri
vate life, who, "in the Interest of cor
porations, of the trusts, of the gas
I r ompany. of the railroad company, of
the Insurance company, has recourse
to every villainy damned in the deca-
Jog-ue; who does the deed of a high
wayman with the sir of a saint."
He referred to the growth of the So
cialist movement as shown by the last
Presidential elections as due largely to
the fact that the masses see large for
tunes accumulated by dishonest means
end when so accumulated combined to
smother Individual enterprise. He be
lieved, however, that the situation was
not without hope, as the very fact that
the country has awakened to the con
ditions and thsjt fearless and able men
are or^anizirg and leading a campaign
against dishouf*ry are grounds for hope
that a -far-reaching process has already
b<--g-un. Simmons discussed the tariff,
Gcoring 1 severely those who debauch the
Jogrislator to - enact laws crushing their
competitors in business or to'exact tribute
from their fellow citizens under the name
In -conclusion. Simmons said:
"While the situation that confronts
us is undoubtedly serious, we cannot
meet it by adopting pessimistic views. We
certainly should not exaggerate the evils
that exist to the point of discourage
ment, but we should recognize their ex
istence and should not underrate their
magnitude, comforting ourselves with the
thought that gradual amelioration must
come, as it always has come with per
sistent and intelligent effort. The very
fact that the country has awakened to
the prevailing conditions and that fear-
Vfs and able men are organizing and
I'.udins a campaign against them are
grounds for hope that a far-reaching rem
edial process has already begun.*.'

WASHINGTON*. Oct. 5. â Oscar J.
Ricketts of Illinois, Acting Public
Printer, will not be appointed as the
successor of Frank W. Palmer, of Chi
cago, the deposed head of the Govern

Brain
WorKers.
Brain workers suffer from
headache because they over-tax
and exhaust the brain nerves.
Tired, irritated, turbulent
brain nerves throb and ache ;
this weakens the brain power,
and robs the memory.
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills
bring tranquility to the ex-
cited nerves and stop the pain.
If not relieved, this nerve
disturbance is frequently ex-
tended to the stomach, causing
nausea, vomiting â sick head-
ache.
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills
are convenient to take â just a
little tablet, that in a few mo-

has been puld na c-ommlnnlonn by the .Mntunl Lite Insurance Cumpanj to
two members of the fnintlr of Richard A. -McCurdy,'. president- of the com
pany, and the promise of DlMtrlvt Attorney Jerome tthnt the lUHurunce acan
flalÂ« certainly, will . be submitted later j to ,an | Mtruordiuary Grand Jury,"
vrere the aeafcationul developments In the Insurance . situation to-day. > '\u25a0
- NEW YORK, Oct. 6.â lt was' brought
out by testimony before the legislative
insurance committee to-day that, Robert
H. McCurdy, a son of Richard A. Mc-
Curdy, has received as commissions on
foreign business 51,163,829 and on do
mestic business $541,952, and that Louis A.
Thebaud, son-in-law . of Richard A. Mc-
Curdy, has received an aggregate of ?&20,
11S in commissions from the company. It
was also brought out that Robert H. Mc-
Curdy expected his income this year
would be about $110,000.
Previous to this testimony. W. F.
Thummel, an attorney for the Mutual
Life Insurance Company, testified that
he had paid to the chairman of the Re
publican Congressional campaign com
mittee the sum of $2500 in cash as a cam
paign contribution.
Jerome, in announcing in court that the
scandals would be 'submitted to an ex
traordinary Grand Jury, said tho inquiry
by the legislative committee had shown
"greater moral obliquity and moral ob
tuseness on the part of persons important
in the business world than did the shock
ing revelations in regard to the Equitable
Life."
Another incident of the day's develop
ments was the publication of a letter from
Charles E. Hughes, counsel of the legis
lative committee, to Samuel Untermeyer,
counsel for James H. Hyde,, the former
controlling stockholder of the. Equitable
Life Assurance Society, in which Hughes
said the committee would make no dis
crimination in favor of Hyde in his ex
amination before the committee. - : '
COIN FOR THE LEGISLATORS;
W. E. Thummel, the attorney who was
associated with Judge Andrew Hamilton
in looking after legislation for the -New
York Life, the Equitable. Life and Mutual
Life Insurance companies in the so-called
legislative pool that was exposed last
week, testified- before the committee that
he was now employed as an attorney for
the Mutual Life Insurance Company at
a salary of $7200 a year. Thummel said
he personally placed in the hands of the
chairman of the Republican Congression
al committee the sum. of . $2500 in- cash;
which had been given for that purpose
by Vice President Robert A. Granniss of
the Mutual Life Insurance Company.
Witness said the contribution had been
suggested by "the danger of a Democrat
ie House, that would result in tariff and
other legislation of a characfer to upset
business -and affect policy-holders. â¢- He
said other companies had been asked to
contribute, but he did not know how
many did.- Thummel denied" having paid
any, money to any legislator for the "pur
pose of .influencing, legislation, 1 or to any
other person . for that purpose. \u25a0 \ '
Thuxmnel \u25a0. described the legislative
pool and said the expenses, were.'met-by
the company looking after the. territory
in which the /expenses/ were 'incurred;
and later anj adjustment of these .ex^
penses was- made "tjetween \ the" three
companies. He^ had received Â« money
from the New York Life in these ad
justments, but kept' no account of his
disbursements., .....
Thummel said McCall was in error
in his testimony yesterday- that he had
paid money to the witness to further
Federal supervision ot insurance. The
witness 1 talked with McCall on this
subject and McCall had promised to
contribute," but no money was " paid" to
Thummel. â¢ '~Jr'
He further described the; division of
territory in the country under which
the three companies looked, after legis
lation affecting insurance interests and
said the Mutual had paid out in 1904
about $15,000 for legislative work.
McCURDV'S K.VORSIOUS -PROFITS.
It was at this point that Robert Mc-
Curdy was called. He had a number
of documents In his hand as he mounted
the platform, and when he had been
sworn he testified that he was the gen
eral manager of tjie- Mutual Life In
surance, Company. His'power, he said,
was delegated to him by the president
and vice presidents of the company/ His
duties were principally confined* to the
supervision of the agency system of the
company in this city and abroad. Like
Perkins of the New York Life Insur
ance Company, he appeared -to be. the
one factor .th^.t built-up the foreign
business of this- company. -His salary
was $30,000 yearly.
McCurdr. had a typewritten state
ment of his career, which he asked per
mission toread.' This detailed his.vari
ous compensations, contracts and-com
missions. There were a number of re
ductions in the commissions, which ho
said were made at. his own request,
owing 'to the : unforeseen" success of the
foreign business. This foreign business
was Inaugurated because of the success
attained by, the New York Life Insur
ance Company and the Equitable Life
Assurance Society.'/ * ,
McCurdy started this foreign busi
ness In ISSS and assumed the office of
general manager In 1903 at a salary of
$30,000. .^gSS&SEIS&H
The most startling 'part of McCurdy's
testimony was made just before recess,
when he submitted a statement of his
profits, or the revenue from, his con
tracts on foreign business. From'lSS6 to
1902. while he was a member : of the firm
of Raymond & Co., the : , metropolitan
agents of the Mutual Life Insurance
Company, his profits were $209,123. Un
der his contract with the firm he paid
"one-half, or $101,561, to Raymond, and
from 1893. when he left the firm, i, to
August 31, . ISOS, his I commissions ' were
$1,059,207, making a total personal . rev
enue from" the foreign business from 18SG
to 1903 of $1,163,829.
GETS AXOTHER HALF-MIUIOJf.'
' -During the period of his connection with
the firm of Raymond & Co., McCurdy,
according to his own testimony, was re
ceiving his share of the profits on the
business of the ' Mutual Life Insurance
Company written by his firm as metro
politan agents. .This sum , McCurdy was
unable to give any estimate upon) and
later, in the day, when Raymond, was
called,' it was brought ouHthat the prof
its; to McCurdy amounted to $541,852 . net,
after his I share of the expenses * of Â£ the
firm's . profits had^ been deducted. This
makes a total of $1,705,681 that McCurdy
received in commissions. ' \u25a0"\u25a0
, In I&93,: when' McCurdy. retired' from the
firm of Raymond & Co..he.was succeeded
by Louis A. Thebaud, a. son-in-law: of
President Richard A: McCurdy, of : the
Mutual. L;fe Insurance Company. V He
was practically under, the same contract
as Robert McCurdy, \ and â from v 1893 to
1904 he recei ved" In commissions on first
premiums and S renewals the sum of : $920,
173. All : these . amounts were In - addition
to salaries .paid McCurdy and

STATE OFFICES
ON THE STAND
Emmons' Defense Makes the
Most of Opportunity and
Probes Continental Affairs
LATITUDE IS ALLOWED
It Is Expected That Taking
of Evidence in Case Will
End Within a Short Time
SACRAMENTO. Oct. s.â To-day In the
trial of E. J. Emmons, charged with
boodiiiig during his term of State Sen
ator, there was unexpectedly afforded to
the defense an opportunity to investigate
the system of accounts employed by the
Continental Building and Loan Associa
tion, the company that participated In
the expose during the last legislative ses
sion. Throughout the afternoon the af
fairs of the Continental were subjected
to the closest scrutiny by Grove L. John
eon, of counB*l for the defense. It was the
fhance denied him hitherto through the
effect of legal objections made and sus
tained when the expert accountant, .W. J.
Falethorpe. was on the witness stand,
and again when the defense would have
txemineJ William CorbSn and his books.
While by no means the most Important
feature of the case as applied to the guilt
or innocence of Emmons. the testimony
\u25a0was just what the defense had been seek
ing, claiming that It revealed the latitude
elinwed to at least one association by the
officers of the State Building an.i Loan
Commission.
J. L. Fields, the secretary cf the com
mission, was put on the stand by District
Attorney Seymour and was called on to
present and read a statement of the as
sets and liabilities of the Continental as
found by the witness In an examination
of the book* made last January. When
the statement had been read the witness
was turned over to Johnson for cross-ex
amination, Tha attorney for the defense
attempted from the first to show the
character and extent of the investigation
be had made at that time.
It developed during tho testimony of
the witness that the statement, compiled
as a result of his official investigation for
the commission, was a copy of the foot
ing* shown by the books of the associa
tion. Mr. Fields said he did not know the
character cr location of the security that
formed so large a part of the assetÃ. nor
was he ablt- to say whether or not the
mortgages mentioned in the records were
of value or worthless. He had not at
tempted to investigate any variety of se
curity, and affirmed that the inspection
was not made for that purpose. Most im
portant of all. according to the opinion
of the defense, the secretary of the
Building and Loan Commission testified
that one of the accounts might be called
"a mere fiction of bookkeeping and a
shrewd device to swell the assets of the
corporation." He admitted that the books
might have been fixed up for his exam
ination without chance of detecting the
fact.
It was promised that the taking of tes
timony would "probably conclude by the
end of to-morrow'J! session or early Mon
day. District Attorney Seymour stated
that his rebuttal would be completed
within a few moments after court was
assembled to-morrow morning. The case
In sur-rebuttal is not expected to occupy
any great amount of time.
DESPONDENT MAN ENDS
LIFE IN A SALOON
Takes Drink of Carbolic Acid
After Complaining of
Poor Health.
SAN BERNARDINO. Oct. s.â Made des
pondent by 111 health, Frank A. Smith,
who recently arrived from Salt Lake City,
walked into a downtown saloon this
afternoon, poured carbolic acid into a
whisky tumbler, drank It and fell writh
ing to the floor. Entering the place.
Smith complained to the bartender that
he was not feeling well. A few words of
sympathy were given him by Spelth, the
bartender, who then turned back to his
'work. Glancing over his shoulder, Speith
taw the stranger lifting a glass to his
lips, and divining bis purpose \u25a0 rushed
around the counter and knocked the glass
from the trembling hand- Smith had al
ready swallowed much of the poison, and
as he fell he screamed, "Send for a doc
tor, I did not take it." He died soon
afterward. He left a letter saying that
his son Is the agent of the New York
Life Insurance Company at Salt Lake
City.
On the outside of the envelope was
â¢written: "I am tired of life. Any

Swiss Matron Blames Bela
tive for the Loss of the'
Affections of Her Husband
SUES HDI FOE DAMAGES
Alleges That Defendant Mis
represented Her to Spouse
and the Latter Left Her
Epcclal Diepatch to The Call.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Oct. s.â The flret
scene In a family scandal which prom
ises to develop into a sensation was en
acted in the Superior Court this after
noon, when Mrs. G. P. Codoni entered
suit against her brother, Victor L. Do
nati, for having estranged her husband's
affections. The plaintiff demands $15,000
damages and costs. She alleges that her
brother has maliciously misrepresented
her to her husband and induced and per
suaded him to separate from her.
The defendant is the senior member of
the firm of Donati & Rlghetti, of which
the husband of the plaintiff was formerly
a partner. The husband and the defend
ant have been friends for many years. It
was due to the efforts of the defendant
that Donati's sister, then a pretty Swiss
maiden, came, to this country eight years
ago. On her arrival at San Francisco she
was met by her brother and Codoni. The
latter fell in love on the spot and pro
pesed marriage on being introduced. Miss
Donati refused, but despite her reluct
ance in three days she was married. At*
the time she did not understand the lan
guage of the country and had no idea
that she was a -bride until after the cere
mony had been performed, when she was
told in Swis3 that she was Mrs. Codoni. .
Mr. and Mrs. Codoni lived in Salinas for
a while. "The young Swiss maiden never
returned the love of her husband and
their life was unhappy. A year ago Mrs.
Codoni made an attempt to end her life
by taking strychnine.
Six months ago Codoni went to Switz
erland and left his wife and his pretty
little daughter, Lydia, at home. Return
ing last week, he did not go to his home
and family, but went to Salinas, where
he intends to start a business. . .
In an interview with a representative
of The Call the defendant denied ever
having attempted to alienate the affec
tions of Codoni from his sister, and said
that Codoni was anxious for her to re
move to Salinas. â¢

COMMON THIEF
Newton C. Dougherty, Capi
talist and Noted Educator,
Is Indicted for Forgery
SCHOOL FUNDS STOLEN
Man Accused of Graft Once
the Head of the National
Educational Association
PEOKIA. 111.. Oct. 5. â Newton C
Dougherty of this city was arrested to
day on a charge of forgery, following
sensational revelations by the Grand
Jury, which has been examining the
books of the Peoria School Board. A
Bhorta&e of |75,000 was found and the
discovery made that the peculations ex
isted over a long term of years. The
ehortagre will reach hundreds of thou
sands of dollars.
In order to cause the arrest of
Dougherty, the Grand Jury made a par
tial report to-day charging forgery. He
was arrested promptly on the street.
but was released on $3000 balL
Dougherty has been City Superinten
dent of Schools for twenty-nve years,
lie is immensely wealthy and is presi
dent of the Peoria National Bank: and a
heavy stockholder in the Dime Savings
and Trust Company, the Title and Trust
Company, the Peoria Livery Company
and other concerns. He is a treasurer
of the fund of $175,000 held by the Na
tional Educational Association and is a
past president of the association. He is
a close friend of Nicholas Murray But
ler, president of Columbia. University,
and has been for years regarded as one
of the foremost educational men la the
country.
The news of his arrest spread like
\u25a0wildfire and created the greatest ex
citement. People could not believe it.
Although there have been rumors of the
gravest character for some time past,
the friends of the iiiiancier -were loyal
to him. This faith was suddenly shaken
â¢when he was taJien like a common
criminal to the office of the Sheriff and
compelled to undergo the humiliating
ordeal of giving baiL This was done
and he walked forth a free man.
\Shortly before his arrest and when it
\u25a0wa^known that he would be appre
hended. Professor Dougherty said that
if the investigation showed a shortage
he would maJte It good. He said that
he would stay right in Peoria; that it
was here that he had been honored, and
here he would stand trial. Later he
sent in his resignation as president of
the Peoria National Bank.
The charge on which Dougherty was
arrested was that of forging a voucher
for ?164 50 for school coal which, it is
alleged, was not delivered. Immediate
ly following its partial report the, Grand
Jury reconvened and continued its in
vestigation of the school funds.

ALCOHOL AND ORATORY
INSPIRE OSCAR LANG
TO BREAK THE PEACE
His Voice Drowns TJtose of Spellbinders
on Grant Avenue and Draws Away
From Them Their Crowds.
HE IS OPPOSED TO MONEY
JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Inspired by absorption of alcohol and
oratory, Oscar Lang ruthlessly shattered
the small fragment of peace that re
mained after the spellbinders <on the
first block of Grant avenue had got fair
ly under way last "Wednesday evening.
Heavily laden with re<J wine, Mr. Lang
hearkened to the speech of a gentleman
who contended in Scandinavian dialect
that the entire sdcio-political fabric Of the
United States is ruined by the ravages of
predatory opulence, and the burning
words augmented the heat of his brain
to such a degree that ho, too, became
a self-appointed counselor of the masses.
Prodaiming his opinion that a wealthy
person is maladorous, his voice ascended
bo high as to swamp all others there in
process of ventilation. The long-haired
masculine denouncer of race suicide was
seen, but not heard, and the short-haired
lady who espoused lifelong spinsterhood
as the only means of releasing her sex
from .man's tyranny was compelled to
resort to pantomime to urge her auditors
to bide with her. For by sheer J vocal
strength Oscar Lang had captured the
asph&lttxm and stampeded the audiences
of ail rivals. He was the central figure
of an immense throng when Patrolman
"Tom" Larkin plucked him out and
scooped, him. in- - * .- . â - - -â¢ - â¢â¢
It was not so much what Mr. Lang
Eaid as his manner of saying It, and the
disorder it created In tha congregation,
that prompted his arrest. His views did
not meet with unanimous concurrence or
anything like It, because they were ultra
condemnatory of money and every per
son possessing it. Among those who
came In for his censoricras comment were
John D. Rockefeller, of cour&e, and J. P.
Morgan, equally of course, and numerous
local owners of real property and bank
accounts. "A rich man don't smell
good" was one of his inelegant utter
ances.
Police Judge Mogan has given Mr.
Lang untU to-morrow to prop up some
kind of a defense.
* * â¢
Harry Wilson pleaded that he was
drunk when he gave a bartender named
"Dick" and two married woman from
Frederick street) $^0 worth of autoing and
then presented the chauffeur, Jose*ph
Holle. with a worthless check for that
sum. Nor was he sober, Mr. Wilson
added, when he treated his party to wine
at various wayside inns and gave uncash
able checks in exchange for the tipple.
It was . not lack of funds, he further
averred, that caused him to flood the
road-houses with valueless bank paper,
as he had just arrived from Tonopah
with cash galore, which, however, he had
prudently deposited where It could not
be drawn after business hours. He had
paid the chauffeur and would pay such
wine bills as were presented to him, pro
vided they were indorses "O. K." by his
companions in the auto. To avert pos
sible domestic unhappiness for the two
ladies in the case he would prefer to
keep their identity undisclosed.
Very penitent did Mr. Wilson appear,
and his respectable apparel enhanced the
impressiveness of his appeal. Judge Fritz
gave him until to-day to pay his saloon
bills.

Seven pupils of the Polytechnic High
Schoolâ registered as Bert Johnson,
Fred Jacobs, Harry Aloyaius, Harry Nich
ols, Arthur Schmidt, Harold Jackson and
Roy Phelpsâ were arrested at 11:30 o'clock
p. m. Wednesday for peace disturbance in
the vicinags of Haight . and Stanyan
streets, and very unhappy they seemed to
be as they stood before Judge Cabanlss,
for they had spent the night in the City
Prison.
Patrolman J. J. Tarpey testified that
the dUefendants routed Morpheus from
the neighborhood mentioned by uttering
discordant yells, and when he remon
strated they saucily informed him that it
was their night to howl, inasmuch as the
football team of their school had that
day defeated by a score of 5-0 the leather-
Kickers playing under the banner of Lick
High. He conceded that theirs was, in
deed, a glorious victory, but reminded
them that the disinterested persons resid
ing thereabouts might prefer slumbering
to listening to the celebration, which he
begged them to postpone until it would
not interfere with the popular right to
pursue happiness. Their response, rau
cously vociferated In unison, was:
Polly, Polly,
Always Jolly!
Poor old Lick.
. Always clck!
Followed by some unintelligible Jargon,
consisting largely of "zips" and "rahs"
and "booms" and "yaps." Then he arrest
ed the seven.
"Far be it from my desire," quoth the
Judge, "to cast a damp blanket upon the
enthusiasm, which Is youth's most blessed
possession and which, alas! evaporates all
too soon of Its own volition. But at; the
same time there . are certain preroga
tives, of adultness ' which the ' law recog
nizes and aims to preserve, - and one of
these Is Immunity from avoidable noc
turnal disturbance." Therefore . It devolves
upon me as a magistrate ; toâ toâ " '
Coming to a full stop, his Honor gazed
inscrutably at the defendants until the
suspense threatened * their physical and
mental collapse, when he,resumed: .. '
"To dismiss you with a reprimand, be
cause you have already, tasted enough of

. John McCarthy, who shot and killed
Myrtle O'Neil in the Scandinavian dance
hall, was arraigned on a murder charge
before Judge Cabanlss and Instructed as
to his rights. His preliminary examina
tion will follow tho inquest on his victim.
Pat Barry, a very old man, utlized
Calvary Cemetery as a sleeping place, and
Judge Cabanlss sent him to jail for four
months.
Joseph Constlni, . employed as a sales
man in the grocery department of the
Emporium, was accused by Special Po
liceman Allen of having "knocked down"
the sum of $150 which he received for
a purchase, and Judge Mogan will give
the case full hearing next Thursday.
Lee E. Folse. attired in tennis flannels,
white canvas shoes and snowy yachting
cap, was attempting to force entrance to
a mercantile establishment on the 200
block of â¢ Post street at a late hour
Wednesday evening, when Patrolman C.
C. Tenney arrested him. He objected to
his captors rough manner and comp a'ned
of it to the desk sergeant at the Central
Station, | and his indignation was in
tense when he caught first glimpse of the
cell to which he was assigned for the
night.
"The ideal" he exclaimed, '.'of com
pelling a gentleman as yet unconvicted of
any offense to occupy such a cold and
cheerless apartment!" /
But he did occupy it, and when sum
moned to fail In line for the gTand march
to Judge Fritz's courtroom he again filed
vigorous protest, pronouncing it perfectly
shameful that he should be forced to join
a procession of tatterdemalions. But the
climax of his wrath was capped when
the Jailer started to manacle him to a
dirty and ragged vagabond, also booked
for trial. A
"Oh, there will' be reprisals for thisP'
he ejaculated. Nor would he submit to
having the handcuff placed upon his wrist
until he had covered the latter with a
dainty white cambric : glove. ' .
While In the dock he sat aloof from
the other prisoners, and with pencil and
paper drew some rather good cartoons of
the court attaches, and when wearied of
that pastime he took from one of- his
coat pockets a corn-cob pipe and a match
and had emitted several thick clouds of
foul-smelling smoke ere he was disarmed
of the offensive weapon. . '
In several other respects the man's
conduct savored so strongly of Insane
prompting that the Judge deemed it wise
to remand him . for examination by the
Lunacy Commission. His long and' ca-
daverous countenanoa, too, was reflective
of a disordered brain, for its . expression
rapidly alternated from grave to gay
without evident cause therefor. Police
opinion is divided as to whether ha is
knave or fool. ';',:&sk:> <-: : }"*^
Arthur White , and Thomas Speakman
are rival corpenters. ; and after Arthur
had Thomas arrested on the charge of
stealing an ax Thomas retaliated by ac
cusing Arthur of battery, whereupon Ar
thur filed a similar charge against
Thomas. Judge Mogan is acquainting
himself with the ramifications and hopes
to be able to j approach the fracas intel
ligently to-morrow.
TWO BURGLARS
IN THE TOILS
Man and Woman Alleged to
Have Bobbed the Homes of
Aristocrats Are .Captured
ENEICHED BY THIEVERY
Pair Wanted for Enormous
Thefts of Jewels in New
York City and London
CHICAGO, .Oct. s.â Two' burglars of
supposed international notoriety are in
the custody of Government officials in
this city and efforts are to be made
by Edward L. Montgomery, stepson of
Isaac F. Lloyd, vice president of the
Mutual Life Insurance. Company,/; to
have the pair taken to New York. -
' Henry Hoffman, who has \ a number
of aliases and who was arrested on
charges of smuggling - diamonds
through the port of Boston, is one of
the persons under arrest. Mrs. Henry
Schiller, who also has numerous other
cognomens, is the other prisoner. â¢ The
speciflo charge on which the,, prisoners
are held is smuggling. Instead of be
ing: merely smugglers, however, it is
now alleged that Hoffman and his com
panions svere implicated in a robbery
in London and in at least two large
burglaries in New York City.
According to Government omolala,
both prisoners have confessed to hav-'
ing robbed the home of Lloyd, where
the woman was employed and was ap
parently, a perfect servant. Hundreds
of dollars' worth of diamonds and .silver
confiscated by the Government when
Hoffman and Mrs. Schiller were* ar
rested have been practically identified
by Montgomery as having been taken
from the Lloyd home in New York.
At the time of the Lloyd burglary ar
ticles to the value of $30,000 were
taken. . . â . r t ,
Another charge which may be placed
against the accused is that of having
robbed the Anaonia Hotel In New York
of thousands of dollars' \ worth of
jewelry and clothing.
\ Mrs. Schiller Is known as an expert
Impersonator of . men. Silk hats .and
various other articles of men's attire
were found in her rooms.
According to * the Government . of
ficials, Mrs. Schiller seems willing to
accept all blame, so that Hoffman may
be cleared. Hoffman admits that he
met the woman near the Lloyd home,
staggering under a load of valuables
she had stolen. He also admits that he
aided her in escaping. ' About 270 dia-^
monds were found in the possession'
of the couple when they were arrested.
Previous to the Lloyd . robbery Hoff
man and Mrs. Schiller are alleged to
have been in London. They are said to
have committed a robbery \u25a0 similar to
that In thfe Lloyd home and Hoffman
is said to have confessed that he buried
the plunder under a tree. Later the
woman, "disguised as a man, dug up
the treasure. She was joined by Hoff
man and the two ftad to the United
States.
Both prisoners have been held to the
Federal Grand Jury by United States
Commissioner Foote and are now in
Jail in default of bail.

HILL TO THE FARMERS.
PRESIDENT J. J. HILL of the Great Northern does some things
in which he might be profitably imitated by other railroad presi
dents. He does not exclude himself and avoid contacts with the
people. He is as good a mixer 'as any politician. When he made
the merger cf several competing roads, which was attacked by Presi
dent Roosevelt and was voided by the courts, he promptly appeared
in the midst of the farmers of Minnesota, Dakota and Washington
to justify his railroad trust and assure them that he would not per
mit it to work their injury. Perhaps he would not, but he has no
more assurance of living aiways than other men, and the machine
which he devised in the hands of his successors might become
a remorseless oppressor of the producers.
As his roads run through an agricultural and pastoral country
he continually champions the farmer against the manufacturer, and
is a pessimist in the matter of the expansion of our foreign trade
in manufactured articles^ In all this he is wisely selfish. As his
declarations are always public he takes the responsibility for them,
and they can be weighed for what they are worth. Criticism of
what he says is not intended to deter other railway presidents from
following his example. We believe that matters in this country
will go more smoothly and different interests will understand each
other better when the people cease to object to the presence, even in
Congress, of men actually engaged in railroading and other great
branches of business. For instance, if Mr. Hill were a Senator from
Minnesota he would have to give his views and justify them on the
floor, meeting opposite views and opposing argument's. -
Under the parliamentary system of Great Britain that is done.
In the House of Commons railroad magnates and John Burns, the
common laborer, meet in the equality of membership and have it
out, face to face. This is better than for one to be in the lobby and
the other in the House. In this country political parties have not
yet acquired the courage to advance to such a policy. As a con
sequence each accuses the other of sending to Congress the attor
neys and agents of great business interests, to represent their em
ployers rather than the people. President Hill now keeps up a sort
of backfire among the people. In his recent appearance to address
the farmers of Southern Minnesota at a county fair he made hay
ag-ainst the administration on the Panama canal and the railroad rate
question. Minnesota is a long distance from the canal and it is easy
to see that people so remote from it will not readily comprehend that
it will be of any benefit to them. But everything that facilitates
the commerce of the world benefits every part of the world. When
Lieutenant Maury demonstrated the economy of great circle sailing
on the oceans and mapped their winds and currents it was said that
he saved $30,000,000 a year to deep-water commerce in the safety
secured and the time saved by saving distance. It might not have
been easy then to demonstrate to far inland farmers that they had.
any interest in Maury *s work, but they had.
Mr. Hill owns an overland railroad and lines of ships which
fetch and cany its tonnage on the Pacific. His interests will be af
fected, he thinks, unfavorably by the canal, so he calls it a costly toy
and minimizes its benefits. This serves his purpose in a double
sense, for it reduces inland sympathy for the canal and, of course,
belittles the efforts of the administration to secure it.
Then turning to the interest of his farmer audience he told them
of the market in the Orient for their crops and the handicap they
suffer from the decline of American shipping.
The address may be seen from two sides. It may.be taken as,
a frank declaration of the community of interest between the trans
porter and the producer, or it may be considered as an argument
for the protection of his interests alone. He warned them against
giving the Government jurisdiction of railway rates,- and it seems
to us failed to comprehend the policy of the President which he an
tagonizes. Putting into competent hands the official power to
right rates when shippers impeach them, which' is what the Presi
dent asks, is a very different thing from having every classification
and every rate of freight made at Washington city, as Mr. Hill seems
to think will be the case. He warned the farmers that when the
Government makes the rates the differential between the long and
short haul will disappear, to the injury of producers that have the
longest haul to market.
Looked at in its wor^t light, if the making of rates became a
political affair, would the people served by the long haul be expected
to sit quietly under the injustice of abolition of the differential? It
would be neither American nor businesslike for them to do so.
However, though Mr. Hill may. get off on the wrong foot, he
deserves praise for getting off at all. The people of California would
like to see his example followed by President Harriman of the
Southern Pacific, President Ripley of the Santa Fe and President
Gould of the coming Western Pacific. They should not only meet
the people -at banquets in the city, but in such rural gatherings as
our State and district fairs. This would bring about a better under
standing, which is much to be desired.
NEVADA LEADS.
*~pÂ»HE whole country has been reading the revelations of finance,
J more or less frenzied, in the practices of the New York insur
*\u25a0 ance companies. Many a policy holder has shaken in his boots
for fear that the reaction will entirely destroy the solvency of the
companies and he lose his policy. The facts have been used to point
many a moral and adorn many a tale, and also as good material for
sermons. But everybody concerned seemed to stand around talk
ing and whittling and doing nothing. Upon this scene of noisy idle
ness suddenly appeared Sam Davis, poet, story writer, newspaper
man and also State Controller of Nevada.
Sam has an eye as liquid and dreamy as a houri, and a most
graceful and elegant deliberation of manner. But those who stake
him out for a quitter lose their bets. He is ex-officio Insurance
Commissioner, with power to license companies to do business in
Nevada, and also with power to revoke such license. Sam took
his pen in hand and informed President McCall of the New York
Life that as far as Nevada was concerned he gave the company's
money to the wrong national committee in a few recent national
campaigns, and until it was restored to the treasury and President
McCall resigned the company could not do business in the sage
brush State.
This was original and it was right. Nobody else thought of it,
and now many States are leapfrogging each other to get in behind
Sam Davis. He has set the pace. None of the good gold money of
Nevada shall go to an insurance company that put its hand in the
pockets of other people to help defeat free silver in 1896. Not that
Sam Davis cares which party gets , the s swag. He has observed the
waste and misdirection of campaign funds, no matter what their
origin or which party gets them, and he wouldswing his snickersnee
as quickly on an insurance company that gave money not its own (to
support the divine ratio of i<>i.
The moral is, if you want originality and effectiveness have a
newspaper man with poetical tendencies for Insurance Cornrriis-t

AUTO FOOLED
CHICKENS.
A farmer of Glendola, near Freehold,
N. J., found on Jhe road an automobile
horn, which plainly had been lost from
some passing auto. He put the horn to
practical use. Instead of calling "Chick,
chick, chick I ere, chick, chick, chick!" he
"honked" the horn and his chickens soon
learned to follow the"honk."'.. ['-'\u25a0\u25a0'
Dr. Ackerroan, of . Asbury Park was
called to a patient in whose throat a fish
bone had stuck yesterday noon. The doc
tor In his auto scooted 5 by the Glendola
farm, tooting his horn like mad. "Dinner
time," thought the chickens, and they
followed the "Honk, honk, honk!"
Seventeen hens and six roosters ran
themselves to death ton the highwayâ and
not a grain of corn! The other chickens
stopped for breath, - then slowly went
home. The farmer found them wheezing
and scratching their heads in the kitchen
door. Now he calls "Chick, chick, chick!"
when he wants to feed them, for they do
not answer the auto horn.â New York

ABSENCE OF FUN IN
JAPAN'S " COMIC" PAPER
TOKIO has a new funny paper,
which; is topsy-turvy enough ;. to
make the world laugh. Ity is
called Toklo Puck, and from its name,
as well as from its general character,
it Is evident that it ' has been modeled
after similar publications in". this coun
try. ;.'\u25a0" \u25a0*: - â¢\u25a0 \u25a0.;.";' '\u25a0['
: Like ; everything Japanese, .it .begins
at the back and goes forward. All
the jokes are printed in Japanese and
explained in English. Either ; . the \u25a0 ex
planatlons are not entirely lucid or ; the
Japanese have not advanced as far in
the ecience of joking ";as Westerners
understand it. . "
Tokio Puck is published every,
month,, and the subscription rates In
Japan, China and Korea are a yen a
year, seventy- five sen for six months,
or twelve sen" a copy. The publishers
"are Yurakucho Sanchome, .Kojimachi-
Ku. In case you should want to call
them up. their -telephone number is
Honkyoku 20-95.
The sketches are somewhat weird,
according to American standards, and
the point of them is invariably, set
forth in a perfect storm ; of 1 Japanese
characters, which look as though the
press wasn't working properly and had
splattered the Ink.

" 'To" pay indemnity to Japan,* the
Czar proclaimed, 'is our greatest shame.

that Japan is allowed to take money as
much as she "want."
... The serial -~ pictures all have elabo
rate and laborious captions,- so that
they are almost as humorous'as a-fu
neral in; the rain:* One of them is en
titled "Ara Mah Story." Picture No. 1
represents a Japanese girl seated at a
restaurant table, with an elderly Jap
anese man . and a young Jap seated at
a table opposite. The young Jap and
the girl are evidently ' flirting 1 outra
geously. The little "balloons" which
comic artists, frequently "use to show
what their subjects are ; saying are at
tached 1 to the eyes instead of to the
xnouths-of the flirting pair. They are
filled with Japanese characters, prov
ing that the eyes of both the young
persons must have been very expres
sive. Thus; is the Japanese comic pic
ture explained:
"Mr. Cholly Uspeaking' in eye) â 'You
catch this letter- and read it in secret.'
Miss Violetâ 'Thank you; please throw
it to me.' "^HBHhBhOMH
INo'. 2 picture shows the letter hitting
the elderly Jap on the head.
"Mr Chollyâ 'Great heavens! I missed
the aim. It hit his head.'>He-'Who is

No. 3 picture shows elderly party read
ing the love missive. .
"Mr Chollyâ 'Dear 'me! . He's reading.
Whatshall I do?' Miss Violet (speaking
in eye)â ' He's mighty poor pitcher, in
deed!' He (reading the letter)â 'Play a
fool with that fellow, - and let's take a
walk to have a good time.'"
No. 4 picture shows Mr. Cholly being
roundly kicked with a pair of wooden
shoes on elderly party's feet.
"Mr.' Chollyâ 'Pardon me, pardon me.*
Miss Violetâ 'Ara mah! ara .mah!' "

"Well, â¢he called Tuesday evening,

he had had a drink or two, but I did
not mind that; for J felt that he prob
ably needed something to brace up his
courage. I was right; he proposed, and
the proposal was quite unique. I think
I could repeat It. Would you like to
hear me?" '
"Oh. do!"
" 'My dear Miss â cr â Helen," he said,
'I think-you must have saw â that is,

that long ere this you must have
looked within my heart and seen â that

it enfolds, Sadie. Has that divine
secret- found no ecstatic response' in
your gentle breast. Louise? Oh, say
not that this is so! Let your dear eyes

t Unqualified Success of Lydia- K. Pink
ham'e Vegetable Compound is the
Case of Mrs. Fannie D. Fox.
One of the greatest triumphs of Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is
the conquering of woman's dread en-
emy. Tumor.
The growth of a tumor is so sly that
frequently its presence is not suspected
until it is far advanced.
(2v Jl/lrs. Fannie D.Fox \v?)
So-called \u2666'wandering' pains" may
come from its early stages, or the
' presence of danger may be made mani-
fest by profuse menstruation, accom-
panied by unusual pain, from the
ovaries down the groin and thighs.
If you haTe mysterious pains, if there
a re indications of inflammation or dis-
placement, don't wait for time to con-
fi rm your fears and gt> through the
horrors of a hospital operation; secure
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound right away and begin its use.

g-ire you her advice free of all charge
if you will write her about yourself.
Your letter will be seen by women only.
DÂ«ar Mrs. Pinkhaia: â
*' I take the liberty to congratulate you on
the success I have had with your wonderful
medicine. Eighteen months ago mymontb-
1 ies stopped. Shortly after I felt so badly that
I submitted to a thorough examination by a
I ihysician and was told that I had a tumor
on the uterus and would have to undergo an
operation. . i
" Soon after I read one of vocr advertise-
ments and decided to give Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound a trial. After
trying five bottles as directed the tumor is
entirely gone. I have been exam! ped by a
physician and he says I have no signs of a
tumor now. It has also brought my month-
lies around once more, and I am entirely
well."â Fannie D. Fox, 7 Chestnut Street,

DAVIS WILL CASE
BEGINS TO DRAG
Discussion Over the Word
"Niece" Becomes Mo
notonous.
The trial of the contest of the codi
cil of the last will of the late Sam
uel Davis continued before Judge.
Kerrigan yesterday, the cross ex
amination of Mary G. Stone, a niece of
the deceased, occupying both sessions.
Mrs. Stone was cross examined by Attor
ney E. S. Pillsbury. who was anxious
that she tell of all of the reasons that
occasioned the belief in her mind that
the codicil was a forgery, those given up
to date including the correct spelling of
the word "niece" In the codicil. Davis,
usually, it is alleged, misspelling the
word, Mrs. Stona, however, admitted that
In two letters received by her the word
was correctly spelled, but where those
letters are she could not say.
Garret McEnerney, of counsel â¢ for the
proponents, said it was unfortunate that
the only two letters in which the word
was admittedly correctly spelled should
be missing and Intimated that the pos
sesson of the letters had been traced to
the contestants. Attorney Van Ness vig
orously assailed the imputation that the
contestants were secreting the letters,
when the court ordered that the hear
ing proceed.
Mr. Pillsbury then asked Mrs. Stone if
the fact that Davis had remembered
certain relatives In the codicil he had not
mentioned in the original will had influ
enced her to believe that the document
was a forgery. Mrs. Stone answered that
she thought these relatives would in
herit through Samuel Davis* sister, Jano
Davis, which was as broad as it was
long, and that herce this fact had not
led her to the conclusion that the codicil
was a forgery, her reasons already hav
ing been given.
At the conclusion of the cross exam
ination a continuance until this morn-
Ing was ordered.

REPORTS: OF STATES
When Utah's Turn Comes the
Practice of Mormonism
Is Strongly Denounced
The deliberations of the United Daugh
ters of the Confederacy were resumed
yesterday morning at the Palace Hotel,
beginning. 'with memorial services. The
Rev. Mr. Crabtree delivered an impres
sive pra*-er. The dead who were rev
erently mentioned for their worthy deeds
and spotless lives were Judge John 11.
Reagan, Judah P. Benjamin, General
Fitzhugh Lee, General Will B&te;
General Will S. Green, late of Co
lusa and a native of Kentucky; General
Thomas J. Churchill, John Shirley Ward,
born in Alabama and for many years
a citizen of California, and General
John B. Gordon.
When the reports of the States were
read the one presented by Mrs. Tom I>.
Pitt of Utah was the signal for a request
that she present a memorial relative to
and condemning the practice of polygamy
and appealing to the whole body of the
National United Daughters of the Con-"
federacy to add the weight of its In
dorsement to the work of "freeing
womanhood in Utah."
QUESTION OF MORMONISM.
The â¢ national president, Mrs. Smy the,
who presided, held that the rules of the
order debarred the introduction of any
thing that savored of politics, whereupon
Mrs. Pitt declared that she desired to pre
sent the memorial, not from the
standpoint of politics, for in Utah
she said they . had Vno politics,
but were ruled by â¢. a kingâmean
ing Joseph Smith. Mrs. Pitt urged her
right to present the memorial for In
dorsement as a member of the Home Pro
tective League in the name of morality
and purity of the home; and under the
banner of the stars and bars, the flag
under which her father fought, she asked
that the subject be considered.
Mrs. Smythe persisted that the matter
did not come in the itne of the business
of the convention and as its reception
would have the complexion of politics
she maintained her opposition' to it. For
a while there was a slight flutter of in
decision as to what step could be taken
by those who supported the proposition,
when other business was called and dis
posed of without friction.
REPORTS PROM STATES.
Highly satisfactory reports from vari
ous States were read by the following
and accepted: North Carolina, Mrs. Rob
inson; Montana, Mrs. Marx; Utah, Mrs.
Pitt; Ohio, Mrs. Thomas Wooster; South
Carolina, Mrs. Mortimer Glover; Tennes
see, Mrs. A. B. White; Texas; Mrs. V. E.
Austin; Virginia, Mrs. Charles Elliott;
West Virginia, Mrs. Reynolds; Alabama,
Miss Arrington; Maryland, Miss Foulkes;
Nebraska, Mrs. Hickman, the secretary
of the convention, and Oklahoma, Mrs.
Rapley of Missouri.
Mrs. Cantrell of Bourbon County, Ken
tucky, took occasion to speak of the gen
erosity of Mr. and Mrs. Wooster of Ohio,
who had given the library and furnished
the Kentucky Confederate Home. Nu
merous other kindly deeds were recorded
in the reports.
In the evening there was a full at
tendance and among numerous other
matters of interest was the report
showing that the total amount received
to date by the treasurers of the central
committee of the Jefferson Davis Monu
ment Association was $71,054 37 and the
disbursement* durinjr the paÂ«t year
amounted to $5000. A motion, by Mrs.
Williams of Tf:xas to abolish salaries of
officers was lo&t. On motion of Mrs.
Livingston Rowe Schuyler of New York
it was resolved' to establish an annual
prize for white students at the Teach
ers' College of Columbia Colleges for
the best essay on subjects pertaining
to the Souths part in the war between
the States.

brutality and inebriety, Mrs. Gage gives
a detailed account of the causes of suf
fering of which she says she has been the
victim for years past. She paints a vivid j
picture of her husband rolling home night
after night overloaded with good ; red ;
wine, topped with sparkling nightcaps, j
and butdened with the temper of a pirate
cheated of his prey. The homecoming of
Gage, as described by his wife, was a ter
rible, even though picturesque, event, the
crash of crockery, glassware and furniture
being the noise accompaniment.
FUN AT HARBOR VIEW.
Mrs. Gage sets forth that she was mar
ried to the man she now seeks to divorce
in New York on July 15, 1897. They have
one child, Marjorle, five and a half years
old. Two years after their marriage,
Mrs. Gage says, her husband told her
to get out and that "he didn't care where
in â â she went." In November of 1900/
she says, he struck her, knocking her
down, and this while she was severely
ill and about to undergo an operation.
In 1904, she continues, he gave her the
names of women with whom he. said he
had been intimate and that many times
he absented himself all night, refusing to
state where he had been. One morning,
Bhe says, he came home and showed her
a picture of himself and a woman with
whom he said he had been intimate.
The picture, says Mrs. Gage, was taken
at Harbor View, and at that resort he
had enjoyed himself with his female com
panion. Continuing Mrs. Gage says:
In the spring of 1905 the defendant came
home, reeling drunk, and tore the bedclothes
off plaintiff and scattered them- over'- the
floor, and followed this demonstration of anger
by stripping the closets and throwing their con
tents around the floor. On April 12 of thiÂ« year
he came home drunk and In the presence of
friends threw a water pitcher across the â¢
dining-room sent all the glasses after It and
finished by' bombardlns the walls with salt
cellars. "This demonstration frightened and
terrorized the entire household," says Mra
Gage, in parenthesis.
PROMISED TO REFORM.
In, July of this year defendant accused
plaintiff of being Intimate with other men and
continued his drunkenness until finally he was
prevailed upon to and promised to reform. - But
he did not reform, but after informing the ser
vants that "he had brought Mrs. Qage to
time" continued his wild career, and even weot
so far as to enjoy an outing at the Presidio '}
with a friend of one of the household servants.
Later the defendant threatened to smash \
open the head of the plaintiff, shook his fist in
her face and on o-nc occasion told the servants,
when about to depart from the house, that he
would soon return drunk and beat the plaintiff
half to death. , â¢
In conclusion Mrs. Gage says that her
husband *is worth about $125,000 and en-
Joys a monthly income of $450. She says
that he Is surrounded by designing
woman and that unless he is restrained
he will sequester his entire estate, secur
ing the aid of these women to do so. She
asks for. $500 counsel fees, $150 a month
alimony and $100 costs. She is represented
by Attorneys Jordan and Brann.

MAYOR SIGNS
THE FRANCHISE
Ordinance Granting Ocean
Shore Company the Eight
to Enter City Now a Law
MEEEMENT IS EATIFIED
Richmond Branch of System
Will Revert to Municipali
ty in Twenty-Five Years
Mayor Schmitz yesterday signed the
ordinance passed by the Board of Super
visors last Monday, providing for a grant
of franchise to the Ocean Shore Railway
Company to operate an electric system
within the city limits. The -Mayor took
action .which makes the franchise a law
after the form of agreement containing
the condition that the park and Rich
mond branch of the system shall become
the property of the city at the end of
twenty-five years, the term for which the
franchise for that particular branch was
granted, had been decided. upon.
The agreement also contains the stipu
lation that' th6 company will abandon its
franchise along Forty-eighth avenue In
return for a similar . privilege along
Forty-seventh, Forty-sixth or Forty-fifth
avenue should; the board so elect in view
of the fact that a park may be construct
ed near the Lake Merced Raricho, which
will include land -on Forty-eighth avenvfe.
A further condition to which the com
pany willingly subscribed 1s its agreement
to carry policemen and firemen in uni
form free of charge within the city lim
its, and also to transport street sweepings
to the park at cost. Frequent consulta
tions have been , held between city
officials and representatives of the com
pany; and the agreement was submitted
in its entirety to City Attorney Long and
Supervisors Comte, Brandenstein and
Gallagher, the lawyer members of the
board. The legal phraseology having
been found satisfactory to the end that
the city will be fully protected in the
matter of its rights *1n the premises, the
Mayor affixed his signature to the ordi
nance, v *
The franchise for the main line of the
system, which runs from Santa Cruz to
a point at Army and Illinois streets, runs
for fifty; years.*-
It was deemed advisable to throw all
proper safeguards, around the privilege
for the Dark branch in view of the legal
doubt raised that under the charter the
franchise for that part of the system
should have been open to competitive bid
ding.- City Attorney Long in a lengthy
opinion had advised the board that the
road being commercial in its character
the invitation of bids for any portion
of it .was not necessary. The agreement
as decided upon was made part and par
cel of the franchise. Work will be vigor
ously prosecuted/ on the road, and the
time, to '-Santa -Cruz will be reduced to
two and a half hours and do much to
upbuild the sections which it will tra
verse. '

People in Superior Court
CONTINUANCE GRANTED
Shining Lights of the Bar
Line Up Before Judge Sea
well, Ready for a Fight
The hands of the law were raised
In pugilistic attitude in Judge Seawell's
court yesterday, marking the opening
of an unlimited contest with James
W. Coffroth, James Edward Britt. Wil
lus Britt, the aioto-Photo Company and
H. J. and H. L. Miles. These sporting
men and the corporation are accused
by Battling Nelson with having con
spired to defraud him of what he
claims is his right to a third interest
In the moving pictures of the Britt
Waterloo at Colma on September 9.
Charles M. fihortrldge, suave and elo
quent, wearing, with other things, a
royal purple tie from which flashed a
gem of purest ray, appeared as chief
attorney for Nelson. Louis P. Board
'man appears on record as another
counsel, and when the case comes to
hearing the talent will be reinforced
In the presentation of the law by Sam
uel M. Shortridge, the master of ora
tory. The defendants are represented
by Attorney Herbert Choynski, who
looked with alarm upon the array of
opposing counsel, but, as a brother of
the once great Joe Choynski, he says
he is prepared to fight to the knockout.
Counsel were gathered in Judge
Sc-awell's court to proceed with the
nearlng of Nelson's petition calling
upon the defendants to appear to show
cause, if they can, why an Injunction
shall not be issued restraining them
from further exhibiting the moving
pictures until the plaintiff's claim is
adjudicated. But the man cent forth
to make service upon the defendants
did not reappear within the allotted
time, and a continuance until this
morning was ordered. Whether or
not the service man ran afoul of a
corkscrew punch or a wallop to the
plexus when he appeared with his
bunch of trouble for the defendants
was not reported back, but the rea
son for his delay will be explained this
morning.
In his complaint Nelson asserts he
and the defendants entered into an
agreement by which he was to have a
one-third interest in the moving pic
tures of his fight with James Edward
Britt at Colma. After the fight, how
ever, the defendants took possession
of the pictures, and Nelson says that
from that day to this he has been de
prived of any voice in the management
of the exhibitions and of any share
of the profits. He asserts the pictures
are worth f 15,000, and that since the
exhibitions were opened in this city
the defendants have taken in $10,000.
He asks that the court decree that he
is entitled to a one-third interest in
the pictures, that the Moto-Photo
Company is an illegal corporaion, or
ganized for he sole purpose of aiding
in the scheme to defraud him; that the
defendants be enjoined from again
showing the pictures until his suit is
adjudicated and -that the defendants
be compelled to \u25a0 account to him for
ail moneys taken in and that he be
given judgment for one-third of the
total amount.

\ The Angels played the game of boot
yesterday afternoon and when they got
started the result was something- to see.
Everything the Seals sent skimming
along the grass was booted around in a
j heartrending manner. Although Baum
pitched big league ball, no one who
reads the score could tell, for all hia
fine efforts were spoiled by rummy
work.
The game looked pretty good till the
sixth, when the Angels began too fall
down a bit and the Seals quickly put
two over. That was not so bad, but
when the seventh opened and six runs
quickly came through the fans fairly
groaned, for the work of the Angels
was terrible.
The arch offenders were Middleton
and Smith. Neither of these two stars
could hold anything that came along.
Middleton is â¢ only credited with one
misplay in the score, but he was guilty
of several errors of Judgment and
stupid work that cost the Angels the
game. /â¢ :'* .?>,
Gochnauer opened up the seventh
with a bunt. Then every Seal took it
Into his head to follow suit. Both Hitt
and Spencer got on the bases quickly,
making a full house, with no one gone.
Mohler was at the bat and the hit and
run signal was tipped. It went wrong
and Gochnauer should have been nailed
a block off third base. But in the'mix
up every Angel who handled the ball
booted it around till the runner was
safe at the plate. After that it was
night caps for the southern brigade, for
the Seals began to hammer runs in in
In jig time till six loomed up at the
end of the spasm.
. Hitt pitched a swell game, of ball in
every inning was always "superbly
backed up, except in the fifth, when a
bad throw by Gochnauer; to first al
lowed Cravath to sneak in with a run.

in the betting, and was only nibbled at,
the play being on Glisten and Little El

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK;' Oct. B.â The Duchess of
Marlborough occupied a box at Belmont
Park : to-day. She had many callers,
among them Colonel George B. M. Har
vey.:, The race in which she seemed most
interested was the third, in which Harry
Payne Whitney started Vanguard. Un
fortunately Vanguard could finish no bet
ter than third, hence there were signs of
disappointment about the Duchess.
There were only three starters in the
Hunter's Handicap, which was the fea
ture, and the race was won easily by the
favorite, Coy Maid, who was off in front,
but in the first quarter Delphic went out
and mado- the running to the stretch,
when Coy Maid took the lead.- Rose of
Dawn came strong in the stretch, but the
favorite was the best and finished in
front by three lengths. Summary:

Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
BELMOXT, Oct. s.â The Stanford
freshmen to-day defeated the eleven,
of the Belmont Military Academy by^
a score of 17 to 5. The game was "
marked by extremely rough play
throughout on the part of tha Belmont
aggregation. The first half opened
with a sensational ninety-yard run by
Holman, the cardinal quarterback,
which netted the visitors live points,
and the sure booting of Crawford, tha
freshman tackle, annexed an additional
tally.
The enthusiastic students had hardly
time to regain their equilibrium befor*
the spectacular feat was again enacted,
only thi3 time it was a fleet-footed Bal
mont runner who. with the ball tucked
under his arm, escaped the waiting
tackles. Belmont failed to kick tho
goal and the score stood 6 to 5.
After the ball was again put In play
the roughest part of the contest took
place. The Belmont line, in a vain at
tempt to stop up the plunges of the
cardinal backs, tore the very jerseys
from the backs of the university
youngsters. Goodell, the fullback, waa
finally shoved over for a touchdown
and Crawford kicked the goal. Score,
12 to 5.
The second half was a repetition at
the first, in as much as the Belmont
players again made a touchdown and
the cardinal youngsters added another
five points to their score.
The line-up was as follows:

The fight fans of this city are duo

can fight, for he has demonstrated hla
ability both in the amateur and profes

the coast followers of the game, but
he comes highly recommended, and the
chances are that he will put up a
whirlwind defense against the clever

Crowe rules a favorite over Moran.
as he has hundreds of admirers in this

about New York for many years, and
has the reputation of being a hard hit

DAY AFTER LONG ILLNESS.
PIONEER BANKER
PASSES AWAY
Ellis A. Haines Goes After
Long Illness and an
Operation at Ripe Age
OAKLAND, Oct. s.â Ellis A. Haines,
pioneer banker and wealthy rancher,
died to-day at his residence, 277 Tenth
street, after a long illness and an oper
ation. The deceased capitalist had re
sided nearly forty years in this city
and more than half a century in Cali
fornia.
Haiues was born in Virginia seventy
six years ago. In his boyhood he went
to Indiana and crossed the plains when
the gold lever broke out In California.
But mining did not attract the immi
grant as did what then appeared to be
the magnificent agricultural posslbilU
ties. After drifting awhile Haines set
tled at San Lorenzo. Later he acquired
large farming and .orchard interests
there, at San Leandro and at Haywards,
besides investing heavily in , Butte
County lands.
His labors were very profitable. In
seeking an outlet for his capital Haines
invested in She stock of the Oakland
Bank of Savings. He was a director
of that institution for many years. He
was a member of Oakland Lodge No.
ISB. Free and Accepted Masons.- His
wife and four children â F. W., John J.,
E. \V. and Marian Heath Haines â sur

Eicliard Barry Does Not Ap
pear for Wedding Eites
and Sweetheart Mourns
SHE DEEMS HIM TRUE
With Faith in Him Unshak
en Catherine Siultz Is
Tortured by Forebodings
. OAKLAND, Oct. 5.- With her faith un
shaken In her lover, who failed to appear
and claim her as his bride on their wed
ding day, Catherine Shultz is waiting at
her home at 544 Alice street to hear of
something terrible that has happened to
Richard Barry of Santa Rosa, formerly"
an employe of the California Northwest
ern. Railroad, who with Jsoo on his person
left that city a few days ago and went to
San Francisco* ostensibly, to make; his
final preparations for his . wedding, that
was to have taken place last night. At
the last moment the minister was notified
and the guests informed that the wedding
would not take place.
"What has become of the groom no one
can tell, but the girl sits in her home and
starts at each noise she hears for fear of
the news she expects to ! hear of him. â¢"I
believe that he has been robbed and mur
dered for his money," she said, "for if he
was alive he would have been : on hand.
I am confident he has . not deserted me.
No. no; 'Dick' is not that sort of a man.
If I thought that, I could bear it; I would
snap my fingers and say 'go.' But- that
is not the case. We loved each other too
dearly, and he thought too much of me to
disappoint me."
Barry was in this city Saturday evening
and made the final arrangements for the
wtdding and seemed in the best of spir
its. On Monday he went 'to Santa Rosa
and drew his money out lof the bank.
Later he vsiited his father, Augustus
Barry, at Petaluma, and Tuesday > was
seen Vat Tiburon, where he was to meet
his tailor from Santa Rosa with his wed
ding suit. Tony Launtern, a brakeman
and friend of Barry, saw him there, and
then all trace of him Is lost. -.
The bridal robe has been laid aside by
the disconsolate girl and doubt and fear
have taken possession of her. Notwith
standing the words of hope spoken by her
family and friends and acquaintances to
reassure her, she shows the effects of the
strain she Is under. If Barry wished to de
ceive her as to his rear intentions he car
ried It out absolutely, for she states she
never had reason' to doubt what he said.
In an effort to clear up the mystery : for
her sake as quickly as possible, John B.
Siiultz, a brother of the young woman,
accompanied by Barry's aged father, vis
ited the police offices on both sides of the
bay to-day and left a description of
Barry.

ens Suicide and Son Has
Him Detained for Insanity
. OAKLAND, Oct. s.â Believing that his
wife has gone away with a man
named .Ed Williams, Frank jT. 'Homer,
stage manager at the Empire Theater,
proceeded to drown his sorrows with
whisky last night,/ and to-day his son
swore to a complaint charging him with
insanity, and Homer pere was arrested
and placed in the detention ward at the
Receiving Hospital. It is alleged by the
boy that . his father attempted to kill
himself by cutting his throat with a
razor ,: but Homer laughs^ at the accusa
tion" and, sobered by' the predicament he
finds himself in, denies that he had any
intention -of doing \u25a0: more than .â getting
drunk. \u0084- ,^ j. '..';\u25a0 -> ,>,;.' ~~\> : - â¢. '\u25a0 ..
\u25a0 '"When I got home from my.. work last
night my wife was gory with the young
est child," â¢ said Homer. " \Vhen I asked
where she was my little girl began to
cry and said she had gone away, but
she did not : know where. - I -waited ' for
hours and finally, although I am" not a
drinking man. I went out and bousht
a buttie of v/hisky, and,. then anotner
and another. What I did or said finally
1 do not remember. I don't say my 'wife
has eloped, but we had a man living^at
our. v house named ' Ed . : Williams, ;V a
newspaper solicitor, and lie made some
trouble, and I finally got him a. position
as advance agent for the Virginia Min
strels just in order to get him out of the
house. - My wife and 1/ have been married
for years and we have, sev
eral children, all of whom are home but
the youngest."
Homer has been connected, with the
different playhouses in this city for a
number of years. He has, sometimes done
a Httie acting himself and his daughter,
Mabel, has also appeared on the stage
wÂ«h him. Five years ago she was
quietly ' married to a, man named
Joseph Denobra, but she never lived with
him and divorce proceedings are now
pending. A few months ago the, daugh
ter disappeared and was located at Stock
ton, but the . father and .;.. mother \u25a0 went
there â¢ and persuaded her to come' home
and she ha 3 been with them ever J since
at their home at 731 Webster street.. What
he, will do to find his wife's whereabouts
Homer has not yet decided.

SAN RAFAEL, Oct. s.â The body of
Edward .Webster, .watchman for a con
tractor working on the Pacific Mail dock,
San; Francisco, was found lying on the
beach near the prison hog ranch at , San
Quentin by a convict at aviate hour last
night. Deputy ] Coroner, Morrison located
Webster's son, Edward Webster, of 1018
Powell street, through an : article in The
Call stating that' the sons were dragging
the bay for the body of paren^.
Young \ Webster identified the body as
that of his father by the clothing and a
bandage.. He said that on the night of
September 24 his father went out. to the
end of. the Mail dock with a lantern to
warn some boats. This was the last seen
of : him. ''.-". . .
The son was anxious to secure a cheap
watch which his father wore in order to
ascertain the time it_stopped. He said
that his father had. money with him to
purchase an" overcoat. A search . of the
remains showed no . watch or. more than
10 cents in coin. The pockets' of the un
fortunate man's clothes' were turned out.
Morrison believes that \. the body was
robbed ; within the last thirty-six hours.
Captain- Russell has closely questioned
the prisoner who found the remains, "but

was no money in Webster's pockets.
There are no marks of violence upon the

STANFORD STUDENT WHO WON
THE PRIZE OFFERED. FOR BEST
BASEBALL. SONG.
PAUL EDWARDS
PRIZE WINNER
Composes Football Ditty for
Stanford and Is Given
$10 by' the Committee
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. .6.â
Paul C. -Edwards '06 has been awarded
the prize of 510 for his song, "A Streak of
Cardinal." which Is considered the best
football ditty ever submitted In the his
tory, of the university. The accepted piece
f-3 set to the tune of the old popular col
lege . song. "Funiculi,- Funicula." The
second prize has been given to Arch Per
rin '06 and J. : J. Sheehy "06, authors : of
"Berkeley's Finish." "Loyal Stanford
Men," by L. S. Levy, and "The Serpen
tine Music," submitted *by H. F. Curran
'06, with words by P. C. Edwards '06, werÂ»
given honorable mention and will be
handed down to posterity in the official
song book of the Stanford University. .
. Edwards, the winner of the 'prize,' is a
senior in the department of English and
comes from Indianapolis. He Is a member
of the Delta Upsllon ! fraternity, and | has
taken, a prominent part : throughout his
university career in the literary organiza
tions of the institution, being at present
editor of the Sequoia. In the plays of the
English Club he has several times taken
Important roles.
At_the.time : the decision was given in
the football song contest the yell contest
was also determined. In this case E.;'A.
Cunha '06, yell -leader, was awarded a
prize of 55 for his yell. A sound similar
to the roll of a drum is produced by re^
peating the letters which constitute the
word Stanford. â¢ The letters S TAN are
in the first group and are slurred. The
F-O-R-D are in a like manner slurred
and the whole repeated. The letters are
then broken up Into groups of two and
are pronounced so as to resemble the
taps of- a drum. The climax of the N yell
is a number of prolonged and. staccato
"Stanfords," ending with a loud "call of
Stanford. |
The words of the accepted song' are as
follows: " ;Â» : ? "' '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0

DEATH-WATCH IS SET
Night in Condemned Cell Af
fects Murderer's Nerve and
He Is Not Able to Sleep
Special Dlscatch to Til* Call.
SAN QUENTIN. Oct. 6.â Frank Woods,
alias St. Louis Frank, the thug who fired
the, shot that killed Policeman Eugene
C. Robinson three years ago, accompanied
by Lieutenant Dan Sullivan and death
watch guards Alvin O. Kelley and Fred
E. Armstrong, went to the condemned
cell yesterday. Woods will remain
there ; until" a few minutes before
10:30, tha hour set for his execution to
morrow-. His first night in the con
demned cell has earned him .the reputa
tion of being the most restless of the
murderers that ever occupied the cell.
All nisrht he tossed and pitched 'at - the
least noise and it was nearly three o'clock
this morning before be got any sleep.
Then he only dozed for a couple of hours.
He partook very lightly of the meals fur
nished him and tried to keep up bis cour
age, but it seems to be oozing out of him.
Woods bitterly denounces the injus
tice of tha courts and feels that he has
been unjustly condemned. He has no
hope oÂ£ any delays and has asked the
warden to issue invitations for the exe
cution to Chief of Police Jerry Dinan and
other officials.
Woods was sentenced to be executed 1
January 21, 1903. but an appeal for a new
trial, prevented it. The second trial took
place last July before Judge Carroll
Cook and Woods was found guilty of
murder in the first degree. t

COMB BACK TO THE FOLD
THEY HAD WAJTDKRED FROM
Twelve Carpenters' Union Delegates
Admitted by Bnlldlnx Trades .
Council to Seats. \u25a0*
There was much joy at . the meeting
of the Building Trades Council last
niÃht when twelve delegates from
Carpenters' Union 453 , applied for
seats in the body. . The, committee on
delegations reported favorably and the
j twelve were admitted.
Carpenters* Union 433 has been af
: iiliated with the Labor Council ' for a.
[number of years, through some mis
understanding" with the Building;
Trades Council wuich had never been
publicly explained. Now the union.
which Is one of the strongest of its
kind in the city, has seen fit to change
its affiliation and seek co-operation
with other crafts allied with the build
ing industries of the city.
The following art the names of the
delegates. "seated last night: *A. \u25a0C.
Woodslde, K. McLeod. F. J. Kramer,
D. Riordan, Edward Marlatt. G. S.
. Brower, W. J. Kldd. E. Bacon. D. H.
Johnson. J. C. Heyraer, William A. Cole
and .T. D. Vanderbilt. 5
. What seemed to brin^ about some
trouble at the Union Iron Works, where
Government work was being done on
the transport Sheridan by the mem
bers of. the bollermakers who belong:
to tho union and who were working"
at less than union rate of wages, has
been settled by the men getting their
regular scale of $3 60 per day for eight
hours. â¢
After aÂ».ftjfl investigation of the sup
posed trouble, that, bad- existed In the
butcher shop of John Hayden ar, 120
Ninth street over an allegation of a
breach of union -rules, the. matter .was
found to 'have no merit, ,'as the men
who work for Hayden . were all unani
mous in giving him the credit of being
one of the -fairest : and most generous
employers in the city.
Josaeljnn Acnln In Trouble.
; Eugene Rattoi saloonkeeper. 1034
Market street, obtained a warrant from
Police .Judge CabanUs "yesterday for
the arrest of Attorney C. E. Josselyn

October 2 Josselyn represented to hln;
that he bad money on deposit with the
Oakland; Bank of Savings and Ratto
cashed a check for .$3O for him. ThÂ»

The ship \V. H. Macy, which arrived
yesterday, fourteen days from Loring,
brought the banner cargo of salmon of
the season. Stowed away in her hold she
has $4,000 cases of the red fish, which

SAYS HE WILL
BLOW UP HOUSE
Crank Demands Joe AVilkins*
Dismissal as Manager. "of
the Tahoe Gambling Club
The Call received a communication yes
terday from a crank, who signs himself
as 1 "A Russian Jew,"- in which he threat
ens^ blow up the Luxembourg, a room
ing-house-at 113 -Stockton street. If the
Tahoe Club does not dismiss from Its spr
viee its manager, Joe Wilkins. The letter
was addressed, "The Call, Third and Mar
ket streets." It was written in lnlc on biue
paper and was mailed In a Palace Hotel
envelope. It read as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. -t, 1003.â Editor Saa
Francisco Call â Dear Sir: I most respectfully
request to / publish In your paper that If Mr.
Joe Cassborm. a.las Joe Wiiklns. - alias Red
Nose Joe, manager of tfee Tahoe Club, U he
13 not let out of the club by the 13th of thu
menth the rooming-house Luxembourg. 113
Stockton street, will be blown up with dyna
mite. Yours truly. A RUSSIAN JEW.
During an early hour on the morning o^
August 27 last a bomb was thrown -f^P
the Tahoe Club, at 104& CFarrell strcef
while fifty gamblers were seated at card
tables. It caused a great deal of excite
ment among trie inmates at the time, but
little destruction was done. " The glass In
the front part of the building was shat
tered and the front doors were broken.
Numerous anonymous letters were re
ceived by the proprietor of the club pre
vious to the explosion, but were regarded
as the work of a crank. The proprietor
'suspected a certain player, who. had been
'barred from the club for cheating, of
j sending them, but he steadily refused ta
i give his name to the police.
The bomb. which exploded was made of
oil cloth and paper bound up with string
and rubber bands, and along with It was
a quantity of offensive matter.
A similar explosion occurred at,.' the
Seattle Club, on Ellis street, a few weeks
previous to the Tahoe Club explosion.

MALAGA RAISINS.
The raisin season opened this week with five
tfelpmetita to New York. ' Small sizes will
be more abundant than last year. This is
because of lack of. rain, dry weather being
detrimental to the growth of the raisin and
producing * scarcity of large fruit.
In extent, however, the crop will fulfill ante
scÂ«eoa expectations, aa approximate forecast
belss ene million boxes. This Is a one -fifth
Increas* over the crop of 1804. Lower prices
vlll prevail at the height of the season, but
tha prtoe of $1 70 per box of Connoisseur
Clusters, at which a shipment was made this
week, will most llkrty bo maintained until
October. The opening first cost prices for
the different crades were as follows:

V^^vi;\V YORK. Oct. B. â The call loan rate
touched the blÂ«h level of the year at 8 per
cent to-day and the etock market as a whole
resumed tbÂ« appearance of last . week. That
* U to say trading became dull and constrained,
but the under tone held firm. Last week the
firmness was generally attributed to the ex
pectation of an early easing of money after
the especial requirements for the turn of the
cuarter and for large syndicate transactions
had been made. In to-day's market, however,
there hse been perceptible growth of opinion
that money rates are likely to be firmly held
for some time tQ come. In speculative cir
cle*, where the talk of the return of ease in
money baÂ» dealt with days heretofore, the
allowance for possible firmness of money was
extended to weeks. In this the speculative
dlpcueeion came more Into line with the preva
lent bank opening, none of which looks for
relaxation in money except with the passage
of weeks aad in some cases look for months
cc the period of duration for higher money
rates In behalf of this opinion bankers
tesert that a firm money market in New York
ih rough the last quarter of the year Is a per
fectly normal condition. The situation this
year It Is pointed out. iâ¬ calculated to em
phasize the condition, rather than to relieve
it. Efforts were made In epeculative quarters,
bcw*ver, to mitigate the Influence lof yester
dey'i flurry In money by attributing it to
epeci&r causes. The rise to-day to above the
rate quoted yesterday rather dissipated the
effect of thiÂ« explanation. The high rate bad
the effect, however, of attracting loans from
outside sources and there were large offerings
on eccount of banking institutions ' at other
point? These funds, however, were drawn tor
the most part from deposits In New York
basks The effect was tbe same as the process
of transfer of loans from the New York banks
to the trust eomoaniflÃ' which hae been go-
Ins on for eeveral weeks, the new loan* neces
sitating to some extent the calling of old loans
by tfce New York banks. Some of the recent
lenders among the trust companies, were re
. C^-v . also to be among those calling loans
i^-dar. A' rise in New York exchange at Chl
ciigo "was a. reflection of the attraction of. the
higher money here. The decline of foreign ex
char.iÂ» was another result. Large additional
arrivals of gold are expected In London to
morrow and the day's decline in sterling rates
her* ic-aves cpen the question of New York's
ability to secure a portion of this. Discounts
moveij upward to-day In London, and in Parts.
and the extraordinarily low proportion of the
reserves reported by the Bank of England gave
occasion 'for surprise that the expected advance
In benk rate was not made. The fact that
Continental exchanges had contlnuel to move
against .London in spite of the week's rise In
tbe open market discount rates there adds to
the puzzle of tbe retention of tfie present rate.
The continued pressure for funds at Paris Is
believed to be due to heavy losses Involved
In the collapse of tbe summer speculation . In .
France. . The day's movements in the money
markets and in the international exchanges
of the world offered no explanation for "\u25a0 the
..\u2666ported shipment of $4,400,000 of gold from
\u25a0Ctif- BanTi of France to London and tbe opera
Â«r-n was the subject of interest acd surmise
> banking circles.' The movement of prices
of stocks under the restraint of the mcne7
market was not important. . but the upward
tendencr' w *Â» <l'Jlte distinct during the latter
part of tbe day. The tone ' of the market
continued undecided. vp to the close, which waÂ»
irreirular.'

ALAMEDA STILL
RESTS ON ROCKS
Underwriters Preparing for
Attempt to Float Her
With All Possible Speed
The liner Alameda still rests on the
shelf off Fort Point to which she! was pi
loted during the fog last Saturday after
noon. The underwriters are working with
all possible speed to prepare the hull for
the effort to float her, and they still have
hopes of being successful.
A fairly heavy swell, set in yesterday
morning and, although not so heavy as
the swell of Tuesday morning, the Ala
meda'more, than once "yielded slightly to
the enormous pressure ; of : : the .: heavy
surge. She. was moved' a. little, but sus
tained, *nb damage; and' the, '"fighting
chance" for saving hÂ«r is still good as
ever. ' .â¢\u25a0:'â¢\u25a0â¢- '\u25a0 -â¢ \u25a0 â¢"*:â¢ :*: .\u25a0;?* \u25a0"
To the people ashore the stranded liner
is still an .object of. keen interest, and
hundreds, on foot, in traps and in automo
biles yesterday vlsljted Fort Point to gaze
out over, the rocks 'and comment sadly
on the hard fate which put so^gallant a
liner in so, sorry a pllgnt. *.
Probably . there Is no vessel on' the Pa
cific to which quite so. much sentiment at
taches as to the Alameda.-' There are
many Honolulu people: living here and
many more who have:. visited 'the island
port. .In Honolulu the Alameda is an In
stitution. She is part of the vocabulary,
and for years nas . marked ' time for the
islanders.
"I am -, coming.. up in about two Alame
das.V the Honoluluite would write.
"See%yqu on 'tne next- Alameda," was
frequently heard. " '\u25a0 . \u25a0 -
For. punctuality the Alameda had only
one- peer, her twin 'sister- Mariposa. now
on the Tahiti runr Between here and
Australia they ran .for years, and trip
after, trip their arrival at. either end of
the long journey could be gauged â¢ within
a margin of minutes. Summer or; winter,
wind, rain or ' shine, smooth \u25a0 weather jor
high seas, foggy or clear, nothing seemed
to make any difference, and when .the
schedule said "Alameda (or \u25a0 Mariposa) to
arrive" the ' Alameda or her ; twin sister
came steering In through" the' heads: at
the hour set by the schedule. .
For the present, however, the Alameda*
is helpless and utterly dependent upon the
efforts of the .men who are nowion board
of* the : stranded liner and < working night
and day. to restore her.tbh the. element
which In the past has been so kind to her.;
That the insurance '.world hap riot given
up the Alameda was evident yesterday, by
a cablegram received from London by_ W.
A. Newell, In â¢ which !;the' stranded : liner
was quoted for. reinsurance at 65 per cent.'

The local police; are investigating,' the
story of a >i fourteen-year-old v Livermore
boy, who claims i to; have been kidnaped
f rom uhis home last Tuesday.': gagged,
thrown into a closed hack and brought to
this city,' where he was f locked ; In a tool
house on the water front from:whlch;he
made his escape by; prying off \u25a0 a board.
Policemen Conlan and McGowan; took the
youngster along \ the "water front \yester
day, -but were" unable to find .'any "con-"
firmation of hiÂ» ; yarn. . The lad's mother
says- her- son is romancing. - - .\u25a0â¢
William 'Ormond Is the name of the
youth and cross. questioning fails to make
him deviate in any Important detail from
the . thread of ; his i original narrative^ ;,
His father \u25a0is a ; farmer.; On .Tuesday
morning > Willie arose with .the sun:;and
was ; esccirting the cow to pasture when
his marvelous * adventure ; began/;' It was
about; 6 o'clock: a. m.C.Out of '-a. cloud^of
dust on- the county; road, there emerged
a closed hack, the running 'gear of \ which
was painted red, says .Willie, and "which
was "drawn "by: -two horses, .one a bay.
and the other white. . ; , ; > . â¢ ,
The hack stopped and two men jumped
out.. Â«They wore false: bea.rds.;One of
them crabbed : the/ boy while " the other
stuffed a -handkerchief -Into his | mouth."
They pulled him inside the. hack. and the
horees started off on a . gallop.
ARRIVE IN OAKLAND.
They arrived t at;" Broadway," Oakland,
about 3 o'clock i in the i afternoon.: The
pnly words said- to, him; that^young Or
mond '^says he remembers were: : "You
are : th*e son * ofr Charlie". Green ; of Stockr
ton. Your ' father^ owns a big saloon and
has. plenty of money. He will have "to
pay Us well before he gets , you back."
The gag in Willies; mouth, he says, -pre
vented - his making any : denial of Mb
supposed Identity and Just /before Broad
way was reached one of the men said:
"I am going . to. take, this . handkerchief
from your mouth and we are going across
the bay. Keep your mouth shut. . If you
open your head I will kill you." >' ~ /
Willie maintained -silence., Neither on
the train nor on the . ferryboat, he .-' de
clared, did i he : make - : any appeal to \u25a0! the
people around for help. ; When they
landed at the ferry depqt ; there was only
one, man with him. He was tall, 'says
-Willie, had a red mustache and . a white
beard, which appeared to be false. " â¢
; From the ferry> depot: they walked
along the water front In a southerly
direction. '\u25a0\u25a0 The. man opened, the padlock
which held ; the door, of a tool-house and
Willie was Invited to step, inside. .'The
doOr was locked on him < and the. man
went : away. When .-\u25a0 his " eyes got:- used
to the dark Willie : found that he- was

tools. â¢'.:-" "'.- .'. \u25a0\u25a0â¢''' - ; '\u25a0-'"-;.;./"' ;
' ; LIBERATES HIMSELF.
Among: the 'tools, saj'SjWillie, was "an.
ax, with which' he . knocked out; a; board.
He crawled through ;; the "; opening"- and
found himself, he maintains, on the water
front, ' Where he could. see the ferry depot
and thÂ« Market { street cars. He : walked
out* to 800 Pase street, -where! his grand
mother,- Mrs. M." F. Pager- resides "and
there, told the i story the . police 5 yesterday
investigated and -failed: to; verify.
He arrived 'at 1 - his grandmother's garbed
in the overalls -he 1 had donned for his
early/ morning ' stunts ' around v the [ farm.
He I. was... dust :i stained and- hungry and
grandma : believed ; the boy's . story and
reported the \u25a0 affair , to the police.
\u25a0 Mrs. Agnes ; Ormond,-:. the *.boyfs \u25a0 mother,
says she . does not believe his story. He
has run away-before, v she f 'says," and has
ah imagination v. which never, fails him

clares. Is his most: ambitious attempt in

The- police^ believe -Mrs. \u25a0 Ormond. -
Willie neither ? looks; nor.-: talks j like -. a
