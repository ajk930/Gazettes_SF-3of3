CARDINAL GIBBONS POINTS OUT NATIONAL EVILS
Cardinal Gibbons, in an interview with a representative of The Gall, has frankly dicussed what he regards as the great evils confronting the American nation. Foremost among. these he places
the lax regard given the marriage tie, the results of the increasing rate of divorce being, he says, horrible to contemplate. The prelate is outspoken in his condemnation of corporation corrup
tion, but sees a hopeful sign in the recent frequent exposures of powerful culprits: He believes the prevalent business dishonesty is a wrong which will right itself.

BROOKLYX, July 26. â The separate
expeditions in Labrador of Mrs. i<eonl
<ias Hubbard Jr., wife of the explorer
who lost his life in the barren regions,
and Dillon Wallace, who accompanied
Hubbard on his fatal tour, are racing
for g-old. Information obtained to-day
from friends of Mrs. Uubbard indicates
that, the Hubbard and Wallace parties
are not In earch of unexplored lauds,
but of mines which Hubbard. is said to
have discovered before^, bis-death/^ "...^j
"Before her 'departure for thY north""
Mrs. Hubbard told several of her con
fidantes in this city that she had In her
possession letters from her husband
telling: of his unexpected find, and also
giving the exact location of the mines. |
In the letters Hubbard intimated that, :
In view of his good fortune, he would!
probably discontinue his exploration
work and return to the United States to
interest capitalists in the development
of his gold mines. Hubbard told his
wife that the mines were worth several
pillion dollars.
When Mrs. Hubbard and George El
sen, the Indian guide, left for the north
several weeks ago, they maintained
significant reticence as to their trip. It
is now learned that Mrs. Hubbard re
fused to divulge any details regarding
the expedition because Wallace un
doubtedly would have learned of them
and hastened his start for the goal for
which the Hubbard-Elsen â¢ party was
bound.
Friends of Mrs. Hubbard say she ex
pects to reach the gold mines in less
than four weeks. They say she does not
contemplate taking up the work of ex
ploring where her husband left off, as
they hardly believe she is hardy enough
to undergo the privations and suffering
to which her husband was subjected for
many weeks before his death. They
also aver that when Mrs. Hubbard re
turns here she will give out a formal
statement vindicating Wallace entirely
of the charge of desertion in connection
with her husband's death.

Wife.
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEU YORK, July 26.â The mysterious
quest of^a secret service detective sent
by President Roosevelt to Governors
Island was explained to-day when
Private James G. Jones, who has been
serving a term of Imprisonment in Castle
William for desertion, was removed on a
special order and examined by. the Board
of Lunacy. o ; "' ? '--
Although great secrecy was maintained,
it was learned that Jones had been send
ing love letters to Miss Alice Rotfsevelt
from the prison. He sent more than a
score. In each of them he implored her
to marry him, asserting that she could
be happy with no one else.
The climax came when Jones sent a
6harp note to Mrs. Roosevelt, in which
he said that she was standing, between
.her stepdaughter and. himself. He de
clared that if Mrs. Roosevelt would only
give her consent he would crown. tne life
of tho President's daughter with the
happiness she craved.
This letter was received at Oyster Bay
last week and President Roosevelt im
mediately ; dispatched one of his Â«\u25a0 guard,
of secret service men to investigate, gjv-
Ing him authority . to act as he thought
best. He had , the soldier?" removed from
the fort prison by special order and
transferred to the military hospital.
Jones was under observation for se\-eral
day*, but the doctors could not tell
whether nr not he was sane. A fuÂ« re
tKjrt of the investigation was sent to
President Roosevelt, and it is believed
he advised the appointment -of a lunacy
board, for one was appointed a~> few days
after he had been acquainted with the
facts. The lunacy board took no action
to-day. Some of its members think that
Jones is feigning insanity rÂ»nd "t'^crs be

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 26.â Cardinal Gibbons is spending the
summer away down at the further %nd of Long Island, in the
modest rectory of Father O l Hara,\wHo is pastor of the local
church. . . x . :
It was in the rectory of Father O'Hara's church that Car
dinal Gibbons explained to The Call correspondent whatthe fear
ed morally and financially from the present condition of
the country. The; Cardinal does not waste words on fancy ex
pressions of .-sentiment nor beat about the bush with fine phrases.
._-\u25a0 -TheGardinal does not look his seventy-one vears. -^he viÂ«pf
of youth is still his fortunate blessing. .^^tv :
Wears Somber Garb of a Priest;
The only marks of distinction visible to the layman's eye
was a bit of scarlet barette, which is only a sku^l cap, and a trace
of scarlet, which showed around his neck. In other respects he
was dressed in the conventional somber clothes of a priest. On a
finger of his right hand, however, gleamed the enormous ring of
his office â a big amethyst stone, set around with diamonds.
As he talked in an amiable, conversational, informal way,
there were occasional interruptions. A young priest or a visiting
churchman would be ushered in, drop to his knees and kiss the
significant ring. In a few terse and satisfying, words Cardinal
Gibbons dismissed one after another.
Corruption as Old as History.
*\u25a0 .... Â«^
"Corporation corruption is a fixed evil that we must reckon
â¢with just as long as the present condition 'of society exists in this
country," said Cardinal Gibbons. "Whenever there is an amalga
mation of great capital or a large collection of men interested in
a money-making concern, there is sure to be corruption. It is a
story as old as the world's history.
"The bright spot in the whole swamp "of the present moral
degradation is the fact that the degradation is made known. Cor
ruption cannot exist nowadays without being discovered.
/"Dread of exposure is a counterbalancing element, and that
fearâ that horror of having a name, once respected, dragged
down â is due to the efforts of the metropolitan press.
" 'A collection of men,' said Mr. Blame. 'will permit a wrong
which no one of. these men -individually would ever think of doing.' '
Money the Great Trouble- Maker.
"That is undoubtedly true of the conditions that have been
exposed in this recent insurance scandal. In this scandal and
various other unfortunate business wrongs that have been exposed
lately it is very much to be doubted if any one particular, man
would do of his own accord what he did as director or stockholder.
"The great trouble-maker to this country is money. ,The ; great
offset to that evil is the American inclination to spend it rapidly."'
"You, consider, then, that American extravagance is some
thing of a blessing?" the Cardinal was asked. â¢
"I do, indeed. Americans are not misers, thank God ! Oth
erwise we woulcl be in a most deplorable condition. When great
fortunes are made they are almost as rapidly expended, and the
constant circulation"of money is one of^he hopeful' signs of 4 ' the
, future."
Prelate's View on Tainted Money.
"Do you; believe there is such a thftig as tainted money ?"
"Indeed I do. There is no* doubt whatever that there are
larger accumulations; of; -money in this country that are yery,much
tainted. However, I never had an opportunity yet of personaliy de
ciding whether money was tainted or not. No money! was ever of
fered me that even had the shadow of suspicion connected with it
in that resect ; but that money has been obtained in a way, which
churchmen could (not sanction in this country 'is a matter of com
mon knowledge." v > \ i,

KNOWN IN WASHINGTON.
Indemnity to Cover
the Full Cost of
the War.
Manchuria Will Be
Given Back to
China.
"Yes 'or "No" Must
Be the Answer
of Russia.
"WASHINGTON. July 25.â Whether there
* to be peace in the Far East or a con
tinuance of the war will be practically
decided at the first 'ausiness meeting of
the Washington conference, which will
convene at the navy yard. Portsmouth.
N. H., about August 5. Baron Komura
will on that occasion communicate to M.
de Witte Â»he essentials of Japan's peace
terms, for further negotiations.
This, it is declared, will not be done
in a spirit of defiance. Indeed, there are
many evidences in the possession of the
neutral governments that Japan is com
ing to the Washington conference, not
Jmbued with a desire to humiliate Rus
sia, but only to exact terms which will
Insure a lasting peace in the Far East,
and which will, in a measure, compensate
Japan for the financial losses in the
present conflict.
Throughout the preliminary negotia
tions, however, Japan has made it clear
at Washington that she wishes to avoid
unnecessary, tedious negotiations.
"We are not going to the conference to
write into the law of nations a new chap
ter," said a high Japanese official re
cently. "For this reason the Japanese
plenipotentiaries will adopt the pro
gramme of at once laying on the confer
ence table those terms, the acceptance of
which, without modification, they are In
structed to insist^_upon as a basis for
further negotiations."
THKSE ARE JAPAN'S DEMANDS.
Although guarding with great care the
official statement of her terms, Japan
has not kept from several friendly gov
ernments the character of these terms.
Official "Washington has been enabled to
form â¢within certain limits a general idea
ot their character.
It is known that Japan will demand an
indemnity that will approximately cover
the cost of the war to date. This was
communicated to Russia early in the pre
liminary negotiations. The amount is still
a secret, but it. is >ased upon the most
careful estimates of the cost of the
war and will be accompanied by a more
detailed statement shewing the method
by which the actual figures were com
puted. It will not fall far short of one
billion dollars, according to advices reach-
Ing here from well-informed sources.
Besides the Indemnity. It is believed
Japan's other essentials to the contlnu-
Bnce of the negotiations are the cession
to Japan of Saghallen and the transfer
of the Russian lease of the Liaotung Pen
tneula and of the railway, as far as
Harbin; the recognition of Japan's pre
dominating Influence in Korea and the
return cf Manchuria to China.
If the Russian plenipotentiaries are pre
pared to accept these essentials, the of
ticials here are confident that the basis
uill be laid for negotiations cure to lead
to the signing of the treaty of Washing
ton, bringing peace in the Far East.
. RESTORATION OF MANCHURIA.
As for the subjects remaining to be
aiscussed, a tedious one, it is believed,
Â»nd one on which Russia will be dis
posed to negotiate with the greatest cau
tion, is the programme for the restora
!ion of Manchuria to Chinese control.
Because of the confusion and the gen
eral disorder likely to ensue in the. prov
ince on the withdrawal of the foreign
urmies. Japan believes that a certain
time will be required in which to restore
public order and the establishment of a
regular system of Chinese police admin
istration. During this period, 'Japan will
Insist that she remain in control of the
administration of the province, at the
Fame time giving a definite pledge finally
to evacuate as soon as China shall be
in a position to take up the reins of the
government there and maintain ' order.
The policy to be suggested by Japan in
this matter will not be unlike the Wash
ington Government in reference to Cuba,
troops being withdrawn from the Island
rs soon as a stable government was in
control of the situation.
A second subject for the plenipoten
tiaries to settle will be the surrender of
all the Russian ships now interned In
neutral ports. Some are Inclined to be
lieve that this demand will form one of
the "essentials." while others claim
ground for believing that Russia may in
duce Japan to take these In part pay
ment of the indemnity.
STATUS OF VLADIVOSTOK.
Europe believes Japan will demand the
neutralization of Vladivostok. The Wash
ington Government does not chare in this
belief. Indeed, in official circles here the
statement is made without hesitation that
euch a demand would not be "moderate"
or "reasonable" and it Is known that
Russia will not permit the subject of
Vladivostok to come before the confer
ence. Rather than submit to Japan's dic
tation on this point, Russia has let It be
known that she would certainly continue
the war.
Little progress has been made in the
direction ol an armistice. London has
not seen its wav clear to aid the Presi
dent in his efforts to this end, and Japan
has in the most determined manner indi
cated her unwillingness to consent to an
armistice until her plenipotentiaries have
met the Russians In conference. The
object of this, it Is explained in an
authoritative quarter, is that Japan
wishes to be assured that Russia, is pre
pared to negotiate In seriousness for
peace before the Japan commanders yield
any of their ground in the field or. give
the Russians time to increase their forces
at the front.
HO3IURA TO VISIT OYSTER BAY.
Will Ue Informally Received by the
President To-Day.
NEW YORK, Ju,y 26. â Baron Ku
mura and Minister Takahira. the Jap
anese peace plenipotentiaries, will
make an informal visit, to President
Roosevelt to-morrow. This announce
ment was made this afternoon when
Minister Takahira arrived from a trip
to Oyster Bay to offlctally notify the
President of the arrival of his colleague
in the negotiations with ' Russia for
peace. Only the two principals of the
delegation will go to Oyster Bay. to
morrow, the other members of the suite
remaining in this city to transact the
business of the commission,- of which
there is a great volume.
The two plenipotentiaries .will, leave
this city at 11 o'clock and it Is under
stood they will return late at night.
â¢ Upon his return from Orster Bay to
cay i*xlnistcr Takahira went directly to
thÂ« .^Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, . where ihe
remlaned In conference with Baron Ko
mura for several hours. After the .de
parture of Minister Takahira, Baron
Komura spent the evening In his apart
ments.
During the day there was a number
of callers and many cards were left for
the Baron, but he is accessible only to
hig suite and a few personal friends.
A report that Crown Prince Yoshl
hito of Japan died last May, the news
of his demise having been withheld for
state reasons, reached Baron Komura
to-night, and the Baron asked the press
to declare the rumor to be without
foundation in fact. The following note
was sent to the Associated Press:
"The report has absolutely no foun
dation. I wwisth t you would be good
enough to deny it on the strength of
my authority. -"

INFLAMES MASSES AGAINST JEWS.
Extraordinary Proclamation Issued by
Odessa's Governor.
ODESSA, July 26. â The Governor of
Odessa has issued an extraordinary
proclamation, which may have the ef
fect of increasing the already bitter
feeling against the Jews among the
tioops and more ignorant classes of the
population. The Governor says he has
received a number of anonymous let
ters from persons designating them
selves as socialists, which he has ig
nored, believing that in many cases
these communications were Inspired by
motives of personal vengeance. The
proclamation continues:
"Letters have also come from the
Jews charging the police with prepar
ing for a Jewish massacre.".
The Governor then declares that such
action I? not possible, but he adds:
"The Governor is astonished at the
Jews addressing such letters to him,
knowing that It is the Jews themselves
who caused all the disorders. The po
lice invariably found revolvers and
prohibited literature in Jewish houses.
But for the Jews there would have
been no disturbances and' no Knlaz
Potemkine affair. Now the Jews have
the impertinence to bring charges
against the police." '/'\u25a0"-':
PLEASED WITH SATO'S TALK.
Russians Believe It Indicates Modera
tion in Japan's Terms.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 26. â The in
terview of Aimar Sato, spokesman for
Baron Komura, in New York on Tues
day was published here to-day and was
received with pleasure in many quar
ters as indicating that the Japanese are
not disposed to insist upon terms which
Russia will be unable to accept.
Mild surprise was expressed at the
Foreign Oflice and several of the em
bassies, however, at the frank intima
tion that Japan would demand an in
demnity and there was even a disposi
tion to criticise the Japanese dele
gate for mentioning the subject, though
that this would be one of the Japanese
conditions has-been taken for granted
and the special dispatches from Berlin
and Paris connected M. de Witte's con
ference with German and French finan
ciers as being for the purpose of sound
ing the markets on the prospects of is
suing an indemnity loan.

JAPANESE LAND IN SIBEHIA.
Cat Off the Escape of Russians From
Saghallen t Island.
ST. PETERSBURG." July 27.âDis
patches from Manchuria report the
landing of a Japanese battalion and
the capture of a lighthouse on the Si
berian coast near Dekastries, a port
formerly called Alexandrovsk, 700 miles
north of Vladivostok, after a prelimi
nary shelling by torpedo-boat destroy
ers. *
Military officials here attach import
ance to the episode -only in connection
with the Saghalien; campaign and say
that as the landing was effected at a
place, where the Straits of Tartary, be
tween Shaglien and the mainland, are
the' narrowest, it apparently is part of
the strategy of the Japanese to prevent
the escape of the Russian garrison in
Saghallen across the straits. They add
that ' the landing, is too far north to
have any bearing on the Manchurian
campaign or operations against Vladi
vostok.
LONDON, .July. 27.â The Japanese land
ing at Dekastries, which is the terminus of
the only cable line /connecting the main
land with the island of Saghalien, is re
garded by the London morning news
papers as an attempt, to seize the mouth
of the Amur River in order to enable the
Japanese 1 to dispatch an "army up that
great waterway for the purpose of threat
ening; the Russian communication. Jap
anese gunboats .and torpedo boats could
thus reach Harbin and? give effective as

STOCKHOLM, Sweden, July 26.â
Count L. Douglas/former Minister for
Foreign Affairs for Sweden and Nor
way, now Governor General. of the pro
vince of Ostergoetland and leader, of
the Storsvenska, or patriotic .party,
whoscname has been mentioned as the
next Premier of Sweden, said to-day of
the crisis between Sweden and Norway:
In the. first excitement after the Norwegian
revolution, and after the Swedish people had
recovered from the (stunning insult to it and
its King, many persons came to the' conclu
sion that. If the Norwegians are. unwilling
to live in peace with us and share the ap
parent blessings of this union of more than
ninety yeara' duration, let them go their
own way and we will go ours, but they could,
have chosen a. more honorable way to break
off - this union. That, at least, we might
have good . reason . to . expect. Now, when I tht
first excitement has passed, Sweden ought to
exert herself to the utmost- not to give up
the union, because. In reality, tho differences
are co Insignificant that they could -easily be
overcome. A new union must be offered by
us to the Norwegians, founded on full liberty,
equality and interior Independence of both
countries, but in which the principle that the
Scandinavian peninsula, as against the world.
Is ooe, must be consequently carried through
Thus we must, besides a common king, have
a common department " of foreign affairs, of
commerce and navigation, of war and of
the navy. And the peninsula . must be Joined
in ; a - commercial union, . co rar as the corj
mercial policy Is concerned. All the places
In "these four departments, from the highest
to the loweot, should be open to either SwedeÂ«
or Norwegians. A union parliament."' meet

Board of Health Adopts
Stringent Regulations
' NEW ORLEANS, July 26.-*-Six deaths
from yellow fever were recorded to-day
up to' 6 p. m., making a total to date of
forty-five. The number of new cases re
ported yesterday, but. compiled to-day, Is
eleven, making all told to date 165. There
are now nineteen foci of infection.
The organization of forces for fighting
the spread of the infection and for a
campaign of education and practical ap
plication of the mosquito extermination
plans, has been completed and besides
100 men put on as extras to clean the
gutters by the city, 350 men are working
as part of the system of sanitation. Citi
zens are- being organized â¢in wards, and
these ward clubs will form precincts and
a canvass will be made to insure the
screening of every cistern and the clos
ing of cesspools and water ponds. The
business men have provided the funds for
this 'work, and as the people are now
aroused to the necessity of action, there
will be no let up. Yielding to, the senti
ment of the community, the State_Board
of Health Monday adopted new. regula
tions for the fruit ships, providing that
they should remain six days at quaran
tine between the last. port and New Or
leans and providing for fumigation here
after the discharge of the cargo, j
The Board of Health desired to give
these/ ships an opportunity to; come in
and -then; put the new regulations into
effect. Dr. Scouchon, after the confer
ence, decided to put the regulation Into
immediate effect and so instructed â¢ the
quarantine officer. Later he summoned
the fruit Importers to his offlc* and ex
plained; the matter to them. Naturally
they objectea, but they realized that tht
sentiment of the community was such
that personal feeling would not be al
lowed to interfere in the present emer
gency. The people are convlncd that the
infection was brought here by the fruit
steamers, and if it ; became necessary to
make the regulations so stringent as to
drive them away, in the present feeling,
auch regulations would be enforced.'
DOCTORS IN CONFERENCE.
In view of the many quarantine compli
cations which have arisen, Dr. Scouchon
has called a conference here next Sun
day, of the -health officers of Texas,
Mississippi and . Alabama to . discuss
quarantine regulations and devise a sys
tem by which ..travelers can be admitted
with certificates of the Marine Hospital
Service. Surgeon White, v/ho is in charge
of all the Government work, will be pres
ent and participate. The work of locating
the detention camps, is progressing,
though that has been slower than at first
anticipated. The residents of Kenner ob
jected to-' the camp and it was located at
Hanran, near the railroad yards. The
locations of the other camps have been
filled and supplies are now being sent to
them. .The infection of the original focus
seems to'be dying out, as fewer new cases
are being reported there, which . is. a
hopeful sign, indicating that the modern
methods have- been effective.
The work now is to locate the new
foci and treat them in the same manner.
Physicians are. now reporting all cases
of fever, and wherever there is the
slightest suspicion, rigid sanitary j rules
are applied with the result that up to
now there has been no spread of any
case from any of these new foci. ThosÂ«Â»
which are developing are all traceable
directly to the original focus in the ca
nal quarter.
The emergency hospital was opened
to-day and patients removed to itjn a
screened ambulance. Dr. John Guiteras,
now president of pathology in the Uni
versity of Havana, .but formerly of the
Marine Hospital Service, and who rep
resented .that service here during the
fever of 1897, has been ordered here by
the" Cuban Government and. will arrive
to-morrow..

remarkable. ' Such a scene 'never before
has appeared . anywhere inland.
Soon the Southern Pacific company's
tracks and roadbed were submerged, re
sulting in an emergency call to Los Anr
geles for assistance. To-day order was
partially restored, although, it is said,
it will require the hardest kind of work
to save the hundreds of thousands of dol
lars' worth of property that, is, in danger.

understood that, the safety valve had
been set to blow" off at 140 pounds. Ten
minutes before Ythe explosion the pressure
was only 118 pounds and was rising.
I The boiler had been cleaned only a
short time before and filled with . fresh
water from ashore. -Only one boiler ex
ploded. An examination of the -inside of
the -ship shows that the hull has been
damaged but' little, If any. The water
which poured irr and caused the, listing
came through the- blow hole and pipes,
broken by the force of the explosion,
the entry of water is now under control
and no difficulty Is expected In making

stands that the department desires him
to institute a searching investigation.
Precautions have been taken by the de

explained in this connection that or

LOST COLLIER
STILL INTACT
111-Fated Tricolor Lies Hard
and Fast on the Kocfcy
Coast at Cape \sleridocino
DEFIES THE BBEAKEBS
Shipping Men Unanimous
in the Opinion That the
; Vessel Cannot Be Saved
EUREKA, July 26.â With a fair chance
of holdinz together for many days yet
despite the fact that the breakers are
pou . ndin S over her; the Norwegian
steamer Tricolor; which went ashore in
the foe at Cape Mendocino - early yester
day morning, still lies hard and fast on
the rocks. From all appearances Bhe is
still Intact and in as good condition as
she was within half an hour, after she
struck the , rocky coast, punctured her
bottom and partly sank. Such"* is the
report that came to-day from, the Ocean
House at Mendocino and closest to the
point of the wreck.
At 11 o'clock the position of the doomed
steamer had not changed and she was
still lying broadside on the beach, de
fying the â¢ heavy- seas which continually
wash her up on J the cruel and Jagged
rocKs. A heavy fog still overhangs the
coast at the, cape,, but \u25a0\u25a0 the vessel Is
plainly discernible from -the lighthouse.
The beach is remarkably free from
wreckage, clearly indicating that the sea
has had but small damaging effect on
the steamer up to the present.. . The
beach is- lined -\ with ..wreckers, : people
flocking .to the scene with . the hope of
securing relics, or, other valuables. Con
spicuous among these are Indians, who
are gathered in- largei numbers and' pa
tiently awaiting the disintegration . of the
hull of iron," which will release every
thing that will float. Owing to the na
ture of the ; coast, however, It is very
Improbable- that anything will be of
much value after it strikes the shore.
There is comparatively little beach, and
what there Is, is strewn . with rocks, up
on which -anything which might : come
ashore .would be broken, to pieces. In
fact Captain Wold figures that so little
can be saved from the ship that he will
not even' go down the coast. He is now
in communication with the owners in
Norway and has also wired the Western
Fuel .Company at i San Francisco, to
whom the vessel was chartered, appris
ing them of the loss â¢of . their cargo of
6500 tons of coal. ;.
' Captain Wold states that the steamer
was fully \u25a0 Insured. He is very bitter in
his comments . of \u25a0 the " lightship sta
tioned on the Mendocino coast and to
whose failure to give good service he
attributes the loss of his ship. He stated
this morning that the lightship was'in
active when' he passed her and that no
sound was heard from her until 4:30 in
the morning, when she started blowing.
This was after the steamer had gone
ashore. ;;
Captain Wold and his men are being
accommodated at the hotels about town.
The Norwegian consul at Sari Fran
cisco will probably be called' upon
and provision, made -for the. men., who
lost everything In the -wreck with the
exception' of a small' quantity of â¢ bag
gage. K6 a,ttemipt will be made to save
the steamer or pull : her ' off the rocks.
Not only Captain Wold but the other ship
ping men- here consider any 'such move
impractical and no such proposition ! haÂ«
been entertained since the tug; arrived
last night with the crew- and reported the
condition of the wreck.
Additional information J confirming the
reports that the steamer Tricolor was
still intact on the Mendocino 'beach was
received upon the arrival of the : Corona
to-day. ; Captain " Gielow stated that
shortly after . docking his steamer
he passed the Tricolor at 9 o'clock this
morning. -He drew in close enough to
get a good view of the stranded steamer.
When seen by him the Tricolor was ly
ing parallel with the coast. It was high
water at the- time. . but .the Tricolor
seemed to be well out of the water. She
appeared as If her : bulwarks were * afloat
and rested so gently, iri an almost up
right oosjition that it did not appear
as if she was on the rocks at all. There
was not a very heavy sea on, but spray
could be seen ' near the stern. In the
opinion of Captain Gielow If the present
weather continues : the Tricolor will not
go to pieces for a' month or more, i With
other shipping men, however, he says it
is impossible 1 to save the vessel.
I, The United States revenue cutter Mc-
Culloch. left Humboldt Bay this even-
Ing with the officers and crew of the
ill-fated Tricolor aboard. The cutter
will arrive in the city -at noon to-mor
row.
"The McCulloch arrived at the scene
of the wreck early this morningr, and,
finding that the crew had deserted the
ship and' that 'no ; assistance could be
rendered; came to Eureka this after
noon. It Is stated to-night that the
Tricolor is still in the same position,
close in 'on the 1 - beach, and the waves
seem to have little effect. Some of the
stanchions are, torn away.

Searchers Find Clothing of

the Banks of Kern Biver
GOLD COIN IN POCKETS
Theory Is Advanced That He j
Wa^ Accidentally Drowned [
Wliile Bathing in "Stream
....... O 1.
BAKERSFIELD, July 25.â Word reach
ed here this evening: that searchers for
Harry W. Freudenthal, chief electrician,
who disappeared from the Kern â¢Â» River
Company's - powerhouse at Borel on July
7, . had lecated the missing man's cloth-
Ing at a point near the Hot Springs where
Clear. Creek runs into Kern River. '
When the clothing was searched some
private papers and $150 in gold were
found in the pockets. From j the condi
tion and position of the clothing it is evi
dent that Freud^pthal had disrobed to
take a bath in the river and was drowned
in a deep hole at. that point.:
Freudenthal was unable to swim, and
probably walked out on a little sandbar
which covers the rocks at that point to
where the water was about two feet deep.
From the. edge of the rock there is a
sheer drop off Into a hole .varying with
the height of the river of from eight to
twelve feet. There is a whirlpool in the
hole and the" water is .very awlft. Being
unable to swim, and there being no one
at hand to . assist him, the unfortunate
young. man 'undoubtedly lost bis life at
that place. .
He had been sick for some time previ
ous \u25a0to his disappearance, and when his
absence was" first; discovered it was
thought that . his mind was temporarily
deranged and that he had wandered away
into the hills.
r Two men in the employ of the com
pany are making a search of the river
bed from Clear Creek down. Freudenthal
was the sole support of a mother and two
sisters, who live In San Francisco.

RENO, Nev., July 26.â Worrying over
his business affairs and suffering from
illness, J. H. Sturgeon, a native of Fol

resident of that place, left _\u2666 his two
daughters . at noon to-day and three
hours later sent a bullet through his
brain. He was found at 7 o'clock to
night almost dead. There is no chance
of his recovery. Sturgeon left a note
bidding- his two daughters farewell and
willing all his property to them. He
stated that he intended to plunge into
the river. The authorities were notified
of this fact, and while the man lay dy

ARE VIGILANT
Will Check Fraud at Polls
Prospects of Success Growing Brighter
A Remarkable chase of the present
political campaign is the proposition of
the Ruefltes to elect as delegates to the
Republican nominating convention men
who nave not the slightest intention of
supporting the nominees of the Republi
can narty at the election in November.
It is known in advance that it Is their
intention to support the Ruef-Schmitz
ticket. When the work of the Republican
convention is finished they will walk up
to Ruef headquarters and openly oppose
the nominees on the Republican ticket.
Take the Thirty-second Assembly Dis
trict Ruef ticket, for example, on which
ten of the proposed delegates hold posi
tions under the Uuef-Schmitz adminis
tration- It is reported at Republican
league headquarters that E. P. Boyle is
employed at the Corporation Yard. F. J.
Zimmermen and Charles Oodsil work Tor
the Board of Education, B. Kendrick
!:â¢ 3ds a position under the Board of Pub
lic Works, B. E. Healy works at the Fire
Department Corporation Yard, "William
- "nvanagn drives the Potrero Hospital
ambulance, John J. Lairrove went to a
place under the Board of Publio Works
last Monday. It is asserted that all the
\u25a0^legates proposed by the Ruefltes in the
\u25a0 nitty-third intend to vote for Schmitz.
The absurdity of askir.gr Republicans to
ttrte for men who have resolved in ad
vance to fight the nominees of the party
js obvious. The Thirty-second District
case is not exceptional. Similar condi
tions prevail in the Thirtieth, Forty
fourth. Forty-fifth and other districts.
In the Forty-second Assembly District
the supporters of the McGowan ticket
claim that the delegates In opposition to
the ticket of the San Francisco Republi
can League will support the nominees of
tiie Republican convention, but the fact
exists, r.erertheless, that Ruef and Koine
2re their support t/> the McGowan
ticket. The Ruef-Keane ticket has b*en
v-Itl drawn, hence the fight is straight
between the forces of the league and the
McGowan following. The opponents of

Republican voters in th* Forty-Beoond
district ehould bÂ«ar in xnlnd that thÂ©
ticket of the Â©an Francisco Republican
I^eapue iÂ« anti-Ruef from top to bot
tom. â¢ Moreover, it la the only regular
Republican ticket, as the county com
mutee. the governing body of the party,
has openly proclaimed its indorsement
of the league's work. It is a source of
regret to many Republicans that dissen
sions exist in the Forty-second, but the
straight-out Republicans cannot get into,
the Ruef camp to please Assemblyman '
McGowan.
The Republican League of the Thirty
fourth assembly district held a meeting
at Improvement Hall, Z>â¬9 Market street,
last night.
F. V. Meyers, the president, was in the
chair, and William Adams acted as sec
retary.
The list of delegates which had been
previously selected by the executive
committee cf seventeen was indorsed by
the cJub as a whole.
Short Fjweches were the order of the
evening. F. V. Meyers said he was sure
that the Republicans would have a vic
tr.ry provided they would all get out and
Tvork.- He said It was no use for each
<:'f> to depend upon his neighbor to do
the work. Each individual must get out
and do the work for himself. The elec
tion cf the primaries was close at hand,
and it was right here at this Juncture
i hat the Republican party wanted to get
::; its work.
E. M. Ritter spoke at length on the
betterment of San Francisco, and stated
Oat no improvement could exist until
there was a change in administration.
He concluded his talk by saying, "that
the present administration is rotten to
thr core."
The San Francisco Republican League
<s in possession of information that R.

formation at League headquarters that
F. McMahon. Republican precinct elec
tion officer Seventy-third . Primary Pre

Election Board Learns T. w. Harring-
ton Gar* Registrar False Address.
ThÂ« Board of Election Commission
ers last night found evidence of what
they take to be a false registration by
Thomas William Harrington, wlio gave
his address in his sworn affidavit as
the Hotel Hlggins. 233 O'Farrell street.
The Commissioners learned from the
proprietor and the servants of the hotel
that Harrington never has lived at
that address and that the room desig
nated is oocupled by E. F. Gray. The
man will be cited before the board and
if he cannot properly show ,a reason
Xor tha apparent giving of a false ad
dress it is likely that he will be turned
over to the officers of the law for prose
cution.
The board is having a hard time to
get a sufficient force of election of
ficers to serve on the day of the pri
mary election. . There are at present
nearly 100 vacancies which must be
filled. Many citizens have not answer
ed their summons and if they do not
obey the next one sent them they may
be prosecuted. Last night A. Kreig;
Henry Miller, the cattle king; M. Gavin,
Thomas Chandler, M. W. Hogan and M.
J. Fontana were excused for cause from
serving. Patrick J. Sheehy, 554 Folsom
street, and John C. Kirkpatrick, both
named as candidates to be voted on at
the primary, asked that their names be
Etrloken from" the ballot. The request
was allowed. . .
William Lyon, 653% Bryant street,
was cited to appear and show why his
name should not be stricken from the
register and on his failure to come be
fore the board the action was taken.
Judge Lawlor will sit in his court on
Thursday, July 27, and on Tuesday, Au
gust 2, for the purpose of hearing mat
ters concerning naturalization.
F. E. Preble, E. R. Faucompre and W.
W. Baueman were appointed deputies
in the Registrar's office for thirty days,
beginning August 1, at a salary of $100
per -month.
XO WORD FROM DEVICE COMPANY.
The Commissioners have not yet re
ceived a reply from the Standard Vot
ing Machine Company in answer to
their telegram that they would accept
the offer made to lend the city of San
Francisco 100 voting machines only on
condition that the members of the board
were not made individually or collec
tively responsible for their return and
safe condition.
S Members of the. Thirty-ninth District
Improvement Club appeared before the
Commissioners and asked that certain
voting booths in that district be moved.
As a result of their appeal, the booth
in the Sixth and Eleventh precincts at
Eighth and Point Lobos avenues was
moved to Sixth and Point Lobos ave
nues; the booth at Sixth avenue and
Clement street was moved to Ninth ave
nue and Clement street; the booth at
428 Twenty-fourth avenue was ordered
moved to 355 Twentieth avenue; the
booth in the Seventy-ninth Precinct
was unchanged. There was reason to
believe that the board had been duped
at its last meeting when It ordered the
booth In the Seventy-ninth Precinct
changed. It was learned last night that
the two men who appeared and-advo
cated the change, William F. Marls and
E. F. McMurray. were not living in that
precinct, as they represented them
selves to be.
The following printed Instructions
were ordered sent to the inspectors:
To the Inspector: During thÂ» day of elec
tion you will direct the clerks to examine the
tally sheet and see that all the candidates'/
names are printed correctly therein, and if
not. have the clerks write the names 'that are
omitted. ~r
The attention of the Inspector is called to
; section 1141 of the Political Code, which reads
as follows : \u25a0 "If the Board of Election Com
missioners fall to appoint th# Board of Elec
tion, or the members appointed do not attend
at the opening of the polls on the morning of
the election. : the electors . of the precinct pres
ent at that hour may appoint the board or
supply the place of an absent member thereof.
By order of the Board of Election Commlssion
; ers. GEO. P. ADAMS, Registrar of Voters.
DRIVES OUT JIO.VEY LENDERS.
Commissioner LÂ«fflngwell Introduced
the following resolution, which was
i unanimously carried:
Whereas, It has been the custom heretofore
of money broken to fill the hallways attached
to the Registrar's office on the night of elec
tion and to rent back rooms of saloons In the
neighborhood of the Registrar's office for the
purpose of advancing money to the election
officers; and - I \u25a0-
Whereas. It has interfered with the conduct
of the office and-has had a demoralising effect
upon the election officers who reach this office
with official returns of the votes polled at the
precincts: therefore be it !
Resolved. .That the Chief of Police be re
quested to detail an officer at the Registrar's
office at 6 p.m., August 8. 1905. for the pur
pose of keeping such persons from plying their
business in the hallways of the City Hail; and
bÂ« It further
Resolved. That th* Chief of Police be re
quested to Investigate and forbid the use of
back rooms of saloons In proximity to the
Registrar's office Xor such use.
Certificate Must Be Issued.
City Attorney Long, yesterday ren
dered an opinion that ordinances Nos
267. 787 and 353 impose a duty on par
ties generating and supplying: electri
cal power to refuse to turn on the cur
rent in such installations until a cer
tificate of proper inspection has been
Issued by* the Department of Elec
tricity. The violation of this ; duty is
a misdemeanor which may be punished
as the"ordinances provide. The.oplnion
was desired In connection with supply,
ing of current to electric sfens.

THE , .,S AN FRANCISCO CALL,: ; THURSD AY,S JULY 27, 1905;
SHORTAGE WILL
BE MADE GOOD
Treasurer McDougald Issues
Statement in Response to
Demand From the Mayor
LAEGE PABT PAID .-IN
Says He Hopes to \ Settle by
Tuesday and Explains the
Inheritance Tax Matter
City Treasurer John E. McDougald said
yesterday that he hopes to turn over to
the city treasury by next Tuesday the
money paid by Deputy Devoto to ex-
Tax Collector Smith on the latter's per
sonal check. McDougald has already
raised $10,575 among his friends and .by
contributions from labor organizations.
This leaves $5015 OS yet to be raised to
make good the shortage.
The Treasurer has been expecting that
tho surety company which was on De
voto's bond for $7500 would consent to
make some of the money good, notwith
standing its claim that" it is not respon
sible for any losses through the "error
of judgment" of the persons insured.
McDougald says that the company. would
only have about $5000 to pay and he will
endeavor to induce it to come to his as
sistance, now that the Mayor has notified
him to put the money back in the city
treasury.
McDougald Bays the $9935 70 paid out as
attorneys' fees for the collection- of col
lateral Inheritance taxes is a legal charge
under an amendment to an act which em
powers the Treasurer to employ special
attorneys to secure the payment of taxes
on collateral inheritances. McDougald
says that the entire amount did not go to
Arthur Flsk for fees, some of it having
been paid to John Partridge and one
Goodlng,
AWAITIXÂ© DECISION.
As to the $3273 15 which the , Mayor
wants returned to the city treasury as
being commissions held out by McDoug
ald pending a court decision as .to
whether he Is entitled to commissions for
the collection of inheritance taxes, Mc-
Dougald says the money is now in the
treasury. The Mayor holds that Mc-
Dougald has no right to the money_in
view of the court decision compelling ex-
Treasurer Brooks to release his claim oh
several thousands of dollars similarly
held out by Brooks.
The Treasurer Issued the following
statement yesterday: â¢ .
I received the letter from Mayor Schmltx this
morning and will reply to it forthwith. Con
cerning the charges therein made I will state
that of the shortage caused by the unfortunate
and Innocent cashing by former Deputy Treas
urer Devoto of the check for $15,65K), presented
by Tax Collector E. J. Smith, I have repaid
into the city treasury ithe sum of $10,675. Of
thU amount $10,000 was deposited by me In
tha treasury over a month ago. To meet the
ehortage r have turned over to the city every
dollar I Doesess and the balance has been
generously contributed by friends and \u25a0 labor
organizations. I desire to state. In this con
nection, that the city and county of San
Francisco haa not, and never will, loee one
dollar through any act of mine or of my
deputies.
NEVER TOOK FEES.
A* regards the collateral Inheritance tax
fees, I have never taken one dollar of the fees
allowed County Treasurers \u25a0 under the general
law. The attorneys' fees disbursed by me are
in accordance with an act of the Legislature
and I thoroughly satisfied myself as to tho
legality of these payments before making them-
In view of the Mayor's declarations, however,
I shall Immediately ask the City Attorney for
a written .opinion on the eubject and will
transmit it to the Mayor so that he too may
be satisfied in this regardJ
Incidentally' the necessity, for the employ
ment of attorneys to collect this tax is shown
by reference to recent proceedings In Judge
Coffey's court over the estate of J. M. Douglas,
where over $30,000 would have been lost to the
State If I had not secured attorneys to act.
This' is but one *of many similar Instances.
Over $780,000 of this tax has been . collected
and turned Into the State school fund during
my incumbency.' Tho balance of fees allowed
the Treasurer after the payment of attorneys
is on deposit In the vaults of the city treasury
and always has been there. Thta balance can
not be turned into the general fund until the
case of Brooks vÂ«. the City and County of
San Francisco Is finally decided by the Su
; preme Court. That the city should be pro
tected I filed with the Board of Supervisors a'
stipulation waiving the etatute of limitations.
In conclusion I will state that I have violated
no provision of the charter or of the statutes
of this State and have always conducted- my
office In accordance therewith.

that the Government proposes- tot-build
on the Colorado River* in the carrying
out of itÂ£. gigantic reclamation project.
That. the contract awarded to White &

be imagined when it Is said that It calls
for the excavation of 305,000 -cubic
yards of solid rock, 252, 000 -cubic yards
of earth and will require the laying .of
27,150 yards of cement, 80,000 square

proper will be about 200 "feet in length.
The contract calls for the completion
of the work within. two seasons.but the
contracting l firm has announced; its .'in-,
tentlon to complete the work in one
season. Upon / this- point Manager
,Slifer said yesterday:
The reason we are desirous of completing

TRAFFIC ROW
Salt lake Officials Still
Insist on Interchange
< AgreeinehtWith Harriman
General Manager R. E. Wells and Gen
eral Freight and Passenger Agent E. W.
Glllett of the- San Pedro. Los Angeles
and.Salt.Lake road are coming here from
Los, Angeles at the end of the week for
the^purpose of reopening the discussion
with Freight Traffic Manager Sproule of
the Southern Pacific Company regarding
the interchange of traffic between the two
roads : at; their Southern California ter
minals.
\u0084w he ,? Uestion has Â» rov oked considerable
Hl-feeling between the officials of the two
roads. Sproule, about two months ago
declined to concede any privileges in this
direction to the Clark road, and the of
ficials of the latter later carded the mat
ter to a conference between Senator Clark
and E..H. Harriman in. New York, when
Harriman sustained- his Southern Pacific
freight authority and the traffic repre
sentatives of the Clark road returned
home In anything but the best of spirits
Now It is proposed to take the matter up
again. Local ' railroad men. who have
been studying the situation, believe that
some understanding will be ' arrived at
between' the two reads, but they doubt
whether the concessions that" will prob
ably be made by Freight Traffic Manager
Sproule will come within, a reasonable
distance of the hopes of the officials of
the, Clark road.
Despite the denials from the officials of
'the: Clark, road that the Montana Sena
tor'and Harriman are not getting along
well in regard to their railroad interests
in- the West, it is common talk "through
out the railroad world that they are at"
outs and that Harriman is carrying out
a plan, long ago devised, to eventually
freeze Senator Clark out of the "San
Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake road,
in which they each now hold an equal
interest. According to the gossip in this
city, Los Angeles and. Salt Lake, Presi
dent Harriman Is looking forward to an
early date when he will have secured the
Clark interest in the s Salt Lake road, re-"
duced its present dignified position in the
railroad world as a Western competing
line to that of 'an ordinary division of
the Oregon Short Line, and -placed his
operating. and traffic officials in absolute
control of : Its destinies.
, lt.ls generally understood that Harri
man, when he has realized this ambition,
will make :W. â¢H. Bancroft its manager,
or rather attach it to the Oregon Short
Line, of which Bancroft la vice president
and general manager, and give the direc
tion of its traffic business to T./M. Schu
macher, traffic manager of the.' Oregon
Short Line, who has of late been taking
a' great deal of interest in the affairs- of
the , new road.
.To his most intimate friends Senator
Clerk has 1 admitted that he is well aware
of the plans of-|Â£arriman toget control
of the Salt ( Lake road. > Only | recently he
remarked Hhat he .would rather turn his
interests in the road over, to the Goulds
than be tricked iby his railroad rival.and
thus I afford 'â the strongest j opponent- of
Harriman in the West an excellent means
of, reaching Los, Angeles, while the West
ern Pacific is" paralleling the Southern Pa
cific by-way ; of * Salt ' Lake. >A : bitter flgh t

Friends of Captain George F. Brown of

him I congratulatory messages upon the
bravery he displayed recently In attempt-
In*; the rescue of Mlsa Nellie Rohlfs from
drowning and. saving three other victims

Miss Rohlf s, who is a . San \u25a0 Francisco
girl, was one of a merry party that em

.At- the ; time, of the accident Captain
Brown,' who i_ was : staying at hlsÂ« Wash

and : ran Aat \u25a0 top speed to the' rescue.
Hardly . stopping to divest himself of
superfluous clothing he plunged into the
lake and; struck out for. the excursionists,
who were floundering in the water.
The.captaiii is. a strong swimmer, and
twice he made, the trip from the scene
of the disaster to the" shore, each time
bearing one- of the unfortunates. For a
third time he essayed the trip, and again
be brought a. helpless woman to the land.
At the end of his third trip, "however, he
had \ to be.l ifted" from the water,' being

who sank' for a third time, and repeated
diving: failed to find her. After- being
taken from the water the captain was
very weak, but with a few hours' rest
was able to 'be. up," and around to receive
the praises of -his admirers at the sum

HALLOCK LEAVES PACIFIC. .,
f COAST STEAMSHIP COMPACT
Will Be Snccc-eded as City Ticket
Agent by Present Chief Clerk
Harry Jarobnon.
The local transportation world was
considerably, surprised yesterday when
the announcement was made that G. /W.
Hallock, for. the last five -years city pas
senger agent of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company, : had resigned. Hal
lock will retire from his position on
August 1 and* will engage in a more
lucrative and private business. It is
announced by General I Passenger
Agent C. ."â¢ D. Dunann- that Hal
lock's successor Is to be Henry Ja
cobson, who has been chief clerk at
the uptown ticket office of the com
pany for ten years. Jacobson's appoint
ment Is a popular one on the street,
for he has a. host of frlends-among the
railroad men. who, while regretting to
lose the association of Hallock, are
pleased to hear of Jacobson's advance
ment.
It Is also given out that the company
has decided -to create the position of
district passenger agent, but Dunann
declined to- make public his 'choice for
the place, explaining -that negotiations
between himself and the desired -party
have not been satisfactorily completed.
He. however, stated that -the man he

last night Mokoto called for help and
Hirschfeld hurried from the interior of
the house and thoroughly angered at
their brutality scored them severely and
began a pursuit of the boys. He had fol
lowed the hoodlums but a short distance
when he sank helpless upon the pave
ment, where he was found by George
Grieg and carried back to his residence.
H'rschfeld was a native of Berlin, Ger
many, aged â¬2 years, and for thirty years
bad lived here. He was formerly a man
of wealth and owned a large tract of
land at the East End. He always took
an active part in matters appertaining to
the city'B welfare. Hirechfeld was en
paged In the real estate business in San

BOY TELLS STRANGE
TALE OF ROBBERY
Berkeley Youth Says He Was
Chloroformed on the
Campus.
i BERKELEY. July 26.â A 6trange tale
of robbery and melodramatic administra
tion of chloroform in broad daylight was
reported to the Berkeley police this af
lernoon by Rock ward Flint, the fourteen
!jear-old son of Mr. and Mrs. G. L. Flint
of 1911 Henry street. According to Flint's
Ktory he was accosted by a tramp in a
lonely and thickly wooded . part of the
University of California campus about 11
..oVlock to-day, chloroformed and robbed
'of a gold ring, which was the only thing
of value he had on his person. When
the lad recovered from the effects of the
drup it was* past 1 o'clock and he "was
lying in the bottom of a ravine about
twenty feet from where the original as
sault took Dlace.
The assault was reported to the Berke
ley .police this afternoon and Deputy
Marshal Moran was at once detailed on
the case. One susjject was arrested to
night, but was released, as young Flint
was unable to identify him as his as
sailant. Flint is employed by J. D. Jay,
a Shattuck-avenue grocer. He was re
turning through the university grounds
after having performed an errand.
""I was passing through the woods just
beiow the university orchard," said Flint
In telling his story to the police, "when
I noticed a tall man with black hair and
a Van Dyke beard sitting on the bank of
a ravine. He had a roll of blankets lying
on the ground beside him. He called to
me and asked me where I was working.
I told him and then he said. 'Sit down a
while and talk to me.* I walked over to
him and as I was about to filt down be
side him he clapped a handkerchief un
der my nose. That's all I remembered
until I came to and found myself lying at
Jhe bottom of the ravine. My pockets
were turned inside out and -my gold ring
was gone. I did not feel hurt. except that
my lips and nose felt swollen and; pained.
I hurried a^ fast as I could back io the
store and tftld Mr. Jay what had.hap
pened." ;';..-

OAKLAND, July 26.â The matter of the
reduction of assessments on a number of
pieces of property was brought up for the
consideration of the Board of Equaliza
tion to-day, and . that . the old Merrill
mansion on Telegraph avenue was not
what it used to be was demonstrated by
the fact that John Conant asked fora re
duction on its assessment from $7500 to
$500. Once.it was the light and life of a
gay and happy throng, out it has gone
sadly to decay, but not to the extent that
Conant claims, according to the opinion
of the equalizers. When they found that
it was insured for $5000 they agreed to
lower it to that figure.-.,
L. J. Hardy was . granted a reduction
from $1100 to $750 on the Hardy home
stead on Castro street. Al â¢ Wood was

one Coroner has an opportunity to rob. an
other of a case and at the 'same time win
grlory for himself, but that is what' Df-H. B.
Mehrmann. Oakland's morgue official, succeed
ed In doing a few days ago. The genial doctor
and his wifÂ« have been enjoylne a etay at

of a perquisite. He and the careless lady
were soon ashore, none the worse for the im
promptu bath, and now the doctor is buby
dodgfng the assortment .of halos that his friends
insist on fitting about hie head.

but this" year Mr. and Mrs. L.uning,are taking
their pleasures very quietly alone.
..One of Oakland's popular officials, Street In

Widow Lemon Passes On
After Many Years of Seclu
sion in Her Husband's Shop
LEAVES STORE INTACT
For Nearly Four Decades Jthe
Dust and Cobwebs Gathered
Undisturbed by a^Hermit
OAKLAND, July 26. â After living for
thirty-five years among the dusty, cow
webbed relics of her dead * husband's
apothecary shop, Mrs. Mary Ann Lemon,
84 years old, was found dead to-day in
her room.
When. her spouse, Dr. Lemon, one of
Oakland's early day characters, , died
his wife immediately barred and Shut
tered the drug store at 706 Broadway
and from "the day , of Lemon's death to
the. hour of her' own passing- , 'Mrs.
Lemon -did not disturb an article, that
the old-time shop contained.
Soon after Dr. Lemon's* demise Mrs.
[Lemon developed a monomania for at
i tending funerals. It was her only de
parture from the hermit-like existence
the grieving woman set herself to fol
| low the remainder of her- days. But
after a time Mrs. Lemon abandoned her
morbid pursuit of somber scenes and
retired .to the dingy, place in lower
Broadway. .
â¢ For years the aging recluse buried
herself amid the! bottles and drugs
without-a companion. It was her be
lief that she. could wander in the dust
laden shop and commune with. the, spirit
Of her departed spouse. Here the be
reaved wife found much consolation,
satisfied, evidently, in her loneliness to
take; comfort from the memories of the
past. About -the place there was an
uncanny atmosphere. . The children in
the neighborhood 'shunned it and the
strange little woman in black. She
seldom appeared Jn view to satisfy the
\u25a0curious gaze of the older and less'fear
some residents thereabouts. . .
But the weight of years, bo wed' down
the widow and she slowly faded away.
Of late Mrs. J. E. Ware had been stop
ping at the" Lemon rooms us a nurse
for the dying woman. Mrs. Ware found
her charge lifeless in bed this morning
at" 10 o'clock. Mrs. Lemon was born
in England.' Coroner- Mehrmann-took
charge.-- - - '. ' V; : ;
BERKELEY EDUCATOR
PASSES LIE DIRECT
Director, KnWles Says A. Pi
Hess, Private Citizen,
Acted in Bad Faith.
< BERKELEY, "July. 26.â tA -lively tilt
occurred"at,last night's meeting of the
Board. of,V-Educajfi6n over^ the , protest
filed by the Ashby Improvement Club,
in which the bo|ird was charged with
gross carelessness in the ; matter of
selecting plans and awarding contracts
for th-i erection' of li $40,000* addition
to the Le Conte School in the Fourth
Ward. 7;'. "^'/
" Director W. A. L...Krtowles resented
the charges of * the protestants and
passed the lie direct, to A.- F. Hess,
spokesman for the. improvers. Hot
words flew thick and fast and it was
not until President .W. K. Wier put an
end to the discussion by ordering the
protest placed on ttle that peace was
restored. \u25a0 .
.In the protest filed by Hess and others
of the Ashby Club.lt is said that , if
the construction of the building pro
ceeds under the, present .plans and
specifications the completed school will
be a flimsy affair, unsafe and not up to
modern standards. Fire escapes are not
provided foriaccording to-Hoss. v . s :. ;
In reply Knowles used strong language
and â¢ accused .the members .of the im
provement club, of Insincerity. He said
that; Hess had 'deliberately lied when
he told the board that he did not know
where the plans for the. school could
be seen. . He Called upon Town Clerk
Merrill to substantiate the. charge.
Hess said that he did know where
the. plans were, but that he was seek
ing information on behalf of his club.
He demanded that the board place the
plans at some designated place so that
they. would be accessible at airtimes to
citizens who desired to inspect thorn.
Judging from the temper of the edu
cators last. night it Is not likÂ«ly. that
the protest will, avail much. .

SAYS HATCHET
CUT THE PIPE
Expert Decides Implement
in Schneiders Room Was
Used t& Make Bludgeons
COOK CASE CLEARING
Sheriff Discredits by In
vestigation Blaker's' Ex
planation as to His Coin
OAKLAND, July 26.â Sheriff Frank
Barnet has enmeshed John Schneider and
George W. Blaker in a web of, circum
stantial evidence, which the Sheriff be
lieves warrants him in making the direct
accusation that they are guilty, of the
murderous assault upon and robbery of
Thomas W. Cook, whose skull was
crushed last Saturday night at Fruitvale,
when $250 was taken from him. .
Cook's chances ofv recovery become
slighter as the days pass. Dr. Dudley
Tait of San Francisco was called into the
case to-day in consuttation . with â¢ Dr.
J. -H. Callen. After a critical examin
ation, meningitis having developed, \an
operation was performed as a last resort.
At the Alameda Sanitarium to-night
Cook, was reported to be â¢ very . low.
Two- important matters of evidence
were- uncovered to-day -by the Sheriff..
The two lead pipe bludgeons found, at
the scene^ of the robbery and a. lather's
or shingler's hatchet found in Schneider's
room were submitted to an expert ma
chinist for his examination. The expert
gave Barnet an unqualified opinion that
the pieces of pipe .were originally in one
section, about four feet Â«ix inches long,
that, this length was cut, and that the
hatchet Barnet found was the utensil
which was used. The expert's identity
will not be revealed at present. Con
cerning this opinion, the .. Sheriff said.: ,
"While a most- cursory examination of.
the bludgeons would disclose to a lay
man's eyes the correspondence of the
cuts and dents in the hacked ends. with
the ragged edges of. .the hatchet, I was
not satisfied to let the matter rest there.
I took the pipe and the hatchet , to an
expert, and his decision is that . .the
hatchet was used to cut the. pipe into
the .. two pieces with which the robbers
felled Cook. His. opinion was not given
until I had acquainted him with the facts
of the case. ' He knew just how much
there is at 'stake, .and in that way the
suspected men might be affected by his
statements.
"The hatchet, therefore, becomes a
very important item of evidence against
Schneider, for it was- found in his room
the day after the -robbery."
Investigation cf young Blaker's explan
ations as to where^ he got- the money he
spent last Sunday, .the 'day after the
crime, has discredited his statements to
Sheriff Barnet. In that particular the
Sheriff said:
"Blaker has told , a .story about the
money, that does not stand, the test..of
close "inquiry. This is also important, for
Blaker. it- is known, did not have money
in' any" considerable Â»aniount just pjibr to
the/robbery." \u0084 â. ~ : â¢-

\u25a0It has been learned that the Lawton

A strong recommendation will -soon be
made to the Navy Department to have

ation bill an item for the erection of two
new buildings at the : Mare Island navy

ment to cost . $400.000. " A - new steam en
gineering building was finished at the
yard last year, but it is not likely that
it will ever -be used for more- than: a
storehouse. It- is too far away from the
old steam engineering . building and its
location is not suitable for. rapid and

PRIVATE SCHOOL
TO DEFY LAW
Berkeley Parents Opposed to
Vaccination Organize to
Educate Their Children
FUNDS ARE SUBSCRIBED
Compulsory Statute and the
Health Officer Can Now
Be Ignored With Impunity
BERKELEY, July 26.â A r- P^ate
school is to be established in Berkeley
by the opponents of the law compelling
the vaccination of all children attend
ing- the .public schools of the State.
I This radical step was decided upon at
a meeting of the anti-vacclnationiats
held last night in Golden Sheaf Hall.
A subscription Hat was opened at the
meeting and in a short time various
amounts aggregating a monthly Income
of over $100 were pledged.
J. G. Wright, a merchant of the coir
lege town, presided at the mass-meet
ing. He placed Golden Sheaf Hall, the
largest building of its kind in the city,
at the disposal of those who have de
cided to oppose the enforcement of the
new law compelling the vaccination, of
school children. In this building the
school will be opened a weejk from next
Monday.
PRINCIPAL SELECTED..
Miss May T. Wilson will be the prirr
cipal of this unique, institution. She
was selected at last night's meeting.
Formerly Miss Wilson was a teacher
in the Lincoln School, but was recently I
retired from the regular School De
partment. It was claimed at the time
that her enforced resignation was due
to the fact that she had openly, ex
pressed her disapproval of the enforce
ment of the vaccination law by the
Board of Education.
The new school is to have a board of
directors to control its destinies and see
that its finances are kept in good con
dition. J. G. Wright has been elected
president of this board and Dr. H. L.
Frazer secretary and treasurer. The
other members are Samuel Taylor. Mrs.
E." C. Campbell, Mrs. Alice Holloway.
Mrs. A. H." McDonald and Mrs. G. Moler.
The directors have been ' given full
power to make all arrangements re
garding the selection of teachers, i
courses of "Instruction and necessary
school equipment! At' .present eighty
children are on the rolls, but by the
time the school opens it is expected
that the attendance will be much
larger.
The situation in Berkeley is unique
in the history of education In Califor
nia, and is the., result of the flght
against compulsory vaccination inaug
urated over a year ago. The leaders
of the fight secured the passage of a
bill at the last Legislature, but the bill
was vetoed by-.Governor Pardee,,who is
a firm believer, injthe^SUftc^- of ..vaccin
ation.. - : v' â¢-â¢ .\u25a0;â¢â¢â¢*â¢ :'-..â¢ :â¢
\u25a0\u25a0HEALTH OFFICER OBDURATE. /
' 'Anticipating, an 'attempt' to evade' the
law at the opening "Of the 'fall school
term, Town Health 1 Officer Dr. George
F/' Reinhart announced that -the law
would be rigidly' enforced and that no
"disability" excuses would be accepted.
He claims that a child "strong enough
to go to school is strong enough to
be vaccinated. '\u25a0
"No vaccination, no school," was the
Health Officer's ultimatum. The anti
vaccinationists have answered by es
tablishing a school of their own and
they defy either the State Board of
Health or Health Officer Reinhart to
compel the children attending this
school to bear their arms to the vac
cination scalpel.
. Meanwhile the members of the Anti
compulsory Vaccination League .will
carry on, their campaign against the
present law, and when another Legis
lature convenes they will renew their
efforts to have the present law re
pealed.
Another mass-meeting will be held
in Golden Sheaf Hall Tuesday night
of next week, when the directors of
the new school will report. v

Charley Graham forgot yesterday that
balks go In this league. Charley must
have been dreaming of the old days in
the bushes "during a blissful moment in
the fifth spasm, for he began to office up
to Brown wnen the latter was about to
deliver the ball. There was a full house
of Seals on the sacks at the time and
Kealon. the man on third, came home.
That was the only run and it won for the
Seals.
It was a bad piece of work on the part
of the leader of the Champions. He should
have known better than to cut in on a
pitcher when he is about to deliver the
ball, but he did. Had it not been for
that break, they might still be playing
at the Eighth-streit lot.
The round opened with a sensation. Ir
wln dispatched a hot one that looked like
a double to the score board, but Casey
rose on his haunches and speared the
leather with his bare mitt; Nealon fol
lowed with a bingle and quickly stole sec
ond. Wilson tore one at Brown and while
the busher was booting the ball Cousin
Parke was safe at first and Nealon pulled
up at third.
Bi<m-n then passed Gochnauer, figuring
on a double play with the bases all full.
He pitched one ball at Whalen, and was
\u25a0winding up for the second when Graham
suddenly gave the office for a brief delay.
But the sign came too late, for Brown
was in position and made a palpable
balk, which let Nealon in.
The Tigers came mighty near scoring
a couple of times. In the sixth. Casey
ewung through to center and was ad
vanced to second on an out. Doyle un
loaded one to right field, but Spencer
handled the ball so fast that Casey did
net care take a < nance in sprinting for
the plate. Again in the eighth, Doyle
Eii;gled over 'second with Casey at the
keystone sack, but again the ball was
handled too rapidly for the Tiger to reach
the pan.
Both teams played nice baseball in the
field, while the work of Brown and Wha
lea on ti.'e slab Wiis about an even break.
Mohkr had nine chances at second and
ate them all up. Wilson's wing was
working right and after he threw out
three men trying to steal second the
champions cut that stunt out for the rest
of the day. The score:

MALARIA
UNDERMINES THE HEALTH
When the germs of malaria enter the
blood the entire health is affected, and if
the blood is not purified of these germs
and microbes. Chronic Sores and Ulcers,
Liver Splotches, Chills and Fever, Boils,
Aches and Pains, and a great variety of
troubles manifest themselves, and soon
\u25a0 the entire system is undermined, leaving
the sufferer a prey to a most miserable,
weak and nervous condition.
013 W. Market St., Louisville, Ky.
For several years Z suffered with Chills
and Fever, caused' by malaria in my
eyetem, and each summer for several
. yearslvrculd nave a relapse. Finally
my physician prescribed S. S. S. I took
a few bottles; this was about six
rears ago. It entirely cured me, and
I have never been troubled sinoe. lam
sure no other xnedioine could have given
zne so- complete and immediate relief,
and I cannot speak too highly of S. S. S.
3Cy partner in business is now taking
S. S. S. for an eruption of the skin, and
a general run-down condition of the sys-
tem, and although be has taken but one
bottle, already commences to feel better.

S. S. S. counteracts and drives all the
poison from the blood and builds up the
system by its fine purifying qual-
ities and tonic effects. It strengthens
every part, increases the appetite, | helps
the stomach and digestion, and by sup-
plying the body with rich, pure blood,
cures Malaria and all its disagreeable ail-
ments. Unlike
tx^tj? Â«^gpr ts^jgr contain a'par-
PURELY VEGETABLE, tide of mineral
of any kind to
disagreeably affect the stomach, diges-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, July 28.â The police again
had charge of the Delmar betting ring
this afternoon, but although the battle
ground belonged to the officers ; the
speculators continued doing business as
ordinarily. Five more men were arrest
ed, but this time by the county officials
under county warrants. The men were
immediately released on bond. Betting
continued in a quiet way all afternoon,
but the continued raids are having an
effect and the attendance was not over
400 to-day.
The management of the Delmar Jockey
Club is losing at least $1000 each day the
track operates, but no signs. of weaken
ing have yet been, manifested by the
magnates. The owners state they will
stick to the game just as % long as the
horses will run, regardless of the inter
ference with the betting end of the
game. As Delmar is making the last
stand of the Western Jockey Club mag
nates to maintain a track throughout the
summer for their followers, it is consid
ered likely that the game will go on in
definitely.

XEVEB- STRIKES A BLOW
Massive Tramp Stays on the
Floor While the Spectators
Voice Their Disapproval
Another stiff rot his last night at thÂ»
Hawthorn* Club's boxing tournament at
Woodward's Pavilion, when Al Kaufmans
of the Olympics handed Charles Hlllard.
the "Texa* Tiger," a sleeper in the first
part of the Initial round. Hardly had the
men unllmbered their mitts be/ore a
blow, which looked slight to the deluded
patrons, shot out from the coast cham
pion's right and the "pride of the South"
Imagined himself to be tn th* vicinity of
Mount Hamilton. The stars he didn't
see were many and If ever a man laid
down without even trying to giv* the
patrons their moneys worth that man
was Hillard.
He was as slow on his feet as th*
proverbial cow and not half a* c!sr*r.
Kaufmann pranced about him as taouxh
he were circling a May-pole looking for
a Itad. which was not lony In comlnjr.
The biff man stalled from th* start. H*
could not block a swing, nor did he thaw
the slightest thing about th* game.
Kaufmann was first In th* ring; bat
the crowd saved their enthusiasm to
greet tbe mystery from the Lone Star
State. Only a glance was needed to
demonstrate that Hlllard was not cut
out for the game. Neither muscles nor
evidence of training showed through tfi*
pink tikin and the galleries cried in de
rision at the flabby monster. Hoots
greeted him as soon as his gaudy calico
bath robe was taken off.
Kaufmann was the first to get down
to work and landed a straight right on
the chest, to which the alleged South
erner was unable to reciprocate. The
wearer of the "O" had the goods with
him and after several passes handed out
a pretty blow that sent the untrained
Hlllard to the canvas.
Under a waller that no ons thought
rood for more than a three-second count
Hlllard took to the mat and with, one
arm on his elbow looked across the ring
for several seconds as If contemplating
the seriousness of the scrap. Slowly he
Bank to the floor, and abandoned the
mill. He closed h!s eyes, to open them
only after being dragged from the ring
amid the hisses of derision of the
patrons. Referee Ed Smith gave the go
to.Kaufmann because of Hillard'a In
competence.
The- best mill amonir the preliminaries
was the Christie-Knock go. each flshter
tearing around In the greatest rough
house scrap of the evening. Both weigh
ed in at 145 pounds. The decision was
given to the former after both had be
come groggy from the rain of blows that
filled the air. ; :^;
John Rodney scored the only knockout
of the night by felling Fawcett of thÂ»
Hawthorne Club In the 130-pound match
during the fourth round. Fawcett was
clever, but his opponent proved the
stronger. V -,V--~
The bantam-weight match between
Roach and Carroll was won by the
former on points, it going the full four
rounds. Kane's old-time cleverness help
ed him win the bo with Brown of thÂ©
Hawthorne Club. After being all but
knocked out several times In his fight
with Flores, Sullivan was awarded the
honors over the Olympic Club man. Jack
Hampton made such a poor showing
when he faced Jack McLaughlln that
Smith declared him incompetent. He was
knocked down three times in as many
seconds.

THE GRAND JURY'S REPORT.
rpHE Grand Jury, after what was evidently a painstaking exam
1 ination, assisted by experts, has massed in a report the record
* facts about the municipal administration. The report shows
maladministration and worse. In several matters it leads up to the
door that shuts in the personal conduct of members of the ruling
junta, where their official power protects .the filthy and lucrative
pursuits of their favorites, who pay for protection by ballot-box
stuffing and other crimes and offenses. Behind these closed doors,
the immoral business of a convict is kindly carried on by a city
officer, while his friend serves his time in the penitentiary. The rent
of another immoral resort is declared by the Grand Jury to be guar
anteed by the Mayor himself. The report shows some of these things
that connect the politics of the city administration with the vices
of the city.
This system is inseparable from government by graft. Im
moral politicians quickly learn the profit that is in the vices of
large cities. When they gain control of municipal administration
every rattle of the dice, every turn of a card and every sacrifice of
a poor soul in its degradation pays to them tribute. This system
is in as full swing here as it ever was in Xew York under Tammany
or in Philadelphia under Billy Mann's "Pilgrim Band." No one ex
pects to purge large cities of their vices, but it *is hoped that San
Francisco may secure a municipal government that is not an active
partner in vice as a business and a means of profit.
Where the activities of such a partnership are regarded as the
principal business and function of city officers, it is natural that
their legitimate duties should be regarded as a remote and inconse
quential side issue, deserving attention only when there is opportu
nity to make a little money on the side. So the report shows a
multitude of violations of the charter, amounting to impeachable
offenses. Moneys are not paid over, but are held out of the treasury
for personal benefit. The interests of the city are* sacrificed to fa
vorites of the government in the matter of contracts. Rents due
the city are permitted to run at the risk of loss, or when collected
are held out The duty of the Mayor to see that all the officers are
faithful and that the taxpayers are protected from loss is left un
done, and leaks, large and little, are dripping cash into dishonest
hands, throughout the whole city sytem.
The reception given this report of the Grand Jury by the offi
cials concerned, and their organs, is as amazing as the facts it( dis
closes. The organs and the literary syndicate which the administra
tion maintains immediately denounced the channel through which
the report became public, as irregular. They discovered that the
report was not authorized. They were frantic because the particu
lar Judge of the Superior Court having jurisdiction of the Grand
Jury had not issued a permit for the publication of the report. When
all of their comments were put in a composite it appeared as their
opinion that the Grand Jury was guilty of a heinous offense by the
alleged irregular publication of its report. The organs did not take
the trouble to explain why it was, irregular, nor to answer any of
the charges it contained. They were noisy about the regularity of
the proceeding in order to divert public attention from facts to a
matter of form. *
Now it makes no difference whether that report came vised
from the desk of a Superior Judge; or whether it was blown out of
the window by a vagrant breeze. Interest in it goes to its sub
stance and material, and not to the channel through which it became
public. The only inquiry made by the people is, are the sixty
charges and specifications in that report true? If true, it is no
answer to them to palter and jackdaw 'about the body, that made
the report, or its regularity. In these matters the truth is always
regular, though it spring from the ground or fall from the sky. Thr
organs of the municipal administration have not disproved a single
charge. They have not tried to disprove any count iri the indict
ment. They have moved to quash only because it did not ' reach
the public under the sacred seal of the Superior Court. If under
the seal of the truth it needs no other. Are the sixty specific charges
against the Mayor and members of the city. government true? If not
all true, which are true and which false? Let the organs or the
Mayor's Cabinet pick out any that are not true, and prove them
false.
The primary election is near. It will determine the character
of the city government for the next term. The charges against the
present government are published on the authority of the Grand
Jury. Do the people of San Francisco want to indorse an adminis
tration that is guilty of the offenses charged? If they snub the
primary and fail to do their duty, the administration and its red
handed offenses will be indorsed by default. ; What' that will mean
may be judged by looking at Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and
other large cities where graft has become fixed as a part of the duties
of administration. What is revealed by the Grand Jury has hap
pened in the green stick. If it is overlooked what will happen in the
dry?
NEW YORK'S HOT WAVE.
4
T"\ ANTHEISM, if it were a true, philosophy, could convict July
|~^ weather in the East of such horrible crimes that the spirit
* of the hot wave would appear one of the greatestfcnonsters of
iniquity. The history of one hot day in New York, namely July
igf is something at once for shuddering sympathy toward the peo
ple of the metropolis, and for strong gratitude that we escape that
horror. It would be a most happy consummation if these two feel
ings could combine to stimulate the invention of a remedy.
Even to briefly summarize the awfulness 5 of the heat's effect
is enough to fully awaken sympathy. It takes a column of space to
give name and address of the dead and prostrated. A woman goes
â¢ mad under the torment of the weather. That is only the beginning
of horrors in that one house, for the crazed woman stabs her nine
teen-month-old baby with a carving knife. Another woman car
ries her baby, Helen, five months old, to the hospital- tp be treated
for prostration; the child had been dead .two hours before she
started, but in the madness of her mother grief she refused to realize
it and took the corpse to the doctorsto 4 beg. them to help it. A
woman, finding the close air of her apartment intolerable, goes out
to sleep on a fire escape. She falls thirty feet arid sustains" serious,
possibly fatal injuries. Another, with mind affected by the heat,
commits suicide by turning on the gas.
Much of help has been given. The parks are thrown open to
the privilege of sleeping under guard of special police there. ; The
.people seek the travel of the subways for the sake of just four, de
gfcees of relief. Fancy that! A heat so oppressive that four degrees
\u25a0of release from it is accounted a mercy and the sufferers hunt the
underground tubes to obtain it. The bathhouses are allowed to
be used longer hours. As for the horses, the ever ready firemen
turn the hose on the overcome ones. Thus also is helped the Si
berian tiger at the Zoo. He is one of the greatest;'sufferers in New
York; never experienced such weather before, and- wishes he was
The thought that comes to overtop all this is that such suffer
ing, should' not be beyond the remedy of modern science.. Living iii
the age of Hertzian waves, of artificial ice, of electricity vastly gen
erated and easily brought from afar, of rapid transit, and of groat
general mastery of mind over physical conditions, it would .seem
that inventive thought should be responsive enough. to bring. forth
the remedy from where it hides. _

OCCIDENTAL
ACCIDENTALS
A. J. Waterhouse
W. E stood together long ago and
\u25a0-'- talked of what should be
When all our ships went sailing
forth upon the misty-sea;
White ships of hope, or gray of doubt, or
gilded barks of blissâ v; .'-'\u25a0 " :
"Ah, we will eatr them far,*' I said,
" 'neath bluer skies than this,: . ;
And whereryjever I may go, o'er unknown
seas to glide.
There shall you be, my bounie one, still
. faithful at my side." ; ' \u25a0\u25a0
Ah, time and tides have ' passed - since
then, yet still her whisper low-
Steals back' to ,me â¢ through \u25a0 phantom
years: "Where'er you go I go."
I know Slot well on what fair bark at
first we sailed away,' \u25a0. - "'\u25a0
But sunny, .were our . skies of : hope;and
cheery was the day; \u25a0 ' ' . -*
And so we sailed straight on and on, hand
clasped in loyal hand.
Through walls of mist to walls. of mist,
to find our Aidennland,
But evermore 'twas just ahead, and ever
we would cry:
"To-morrow all the mists- will fade and
we our land shall spy,'* . > -
And still her white, hand steered my
bark, by waves tossed to and fro,
And . still I heard her j promise sweet.
"Where'er you go I go."
Still drifts my ship upon the sea through
mists of sullen gray,
But she who sailed a time with me, she
"is away â away.
A craft came sailing down the wind from
. some yet hidden shore:
The' captain was both gaunt and grim,
and cerements he wore.
He beckoned to my bonnie lass: "Come,
call away with me,
And you shall reach your Aidennland be
yond this restless sea,
And lie shall meet you there." Ah me!
the years are long, 1 know, -,'\u25a0â¢.-
Since last I heard her whispered word,
"Where'er you go I go." \ '.
My bark drifts in, my bark drifts out; it
lacks her- watchful care. ;
I sail o'er seas of gloom and doubt, nor
' land is anywhere.
Yet ftlll I trust that captain grim who
bore my lass . away,
Nor uotiSt : ..ile" loimtl her Aidennland be
yond the mist of gray.
So drift, my craft, and lift, my craft, on
billows mistward tossed:
She knows the bliss that now I miss, nor
is forever lost.
And some bright dayâ l know not when â
I'll hear her whisper low:
"Dear love, we in Aidennlandâ
where'er you go I go."
TROUBLE with life es I've {found it

RURAL FRANCE
HOME OF LOVE
Dorothy Fenimore
PARIS, July 10. .
IT would be difficult; to find a more
suitable background for love mak
'ingr. than the "rural landscape of
' central â¢ prance affords. Earth and
sky combine their beauties to form a
rustic paradise."; In June nature wan
' ders down the fertile river valleys'llke
a: lovely 'princess ''who is crowned with
flowers and goes her way carelessly
yet nobly, veiled softly in a rosy mist.
,â¢ Whether you follow the: high road or
the meadow? path, ; presently you find
yourself Joet in a veritable tanglewood
of sound and sense. Above the other,
bird notes Iwhich thrill the air the
cuckoo's call sounds; clear, the cricket
chirps a home song at your, feet, and
in the neighboring clump, of trees a
woodpecker whistles for rain. , '
â To. the i right; the river, at this point
in its course no more' than a creek,
winds gracefully between sweet mead
ows, or under willow branches; farther
down, where it widens out, just beyond
the small arched' .bridge," there is an
old mill and a washhouse standing in
the stream. To .the right, at a âdis
tance, the hill tops: are outlined against
a summer sky, and. ahead are uplands
which, seem to- touch the lightly float
ing clouds. . ,- .V-
Yet youth is absent from every cor
ner of the scene, and without youth
you .cannot have romance. In \u25a0 the wide
fields .where poppies flame in the wav
ing grassland where bluets nod lightly
mid the ripening grain, you see only
old people working, bending their backs
wearily beneath a double weight of toll
and years. For all the young men are
serving in the army.
And the girls have gone to Paris, or
to some lesser city. nearer by, not to
earn a living merely, but also, if pos
sible, to earn a dot. \u25a0 '
You cannot help feeling^ that, it If
a pity that strangers only, who are
rarely in . a picturesquely sentimental
mood, have a chance to enjoy the at
tractive- lovers' nooks, that : 'i th s
neighborhood abound, the while the
rightful owners are far. away, plodding
through the prose of. life.
In the village customs hereabout,
however, a trace of the poety of the
country life of former days remains in
the crowning of the . Rosiere, which
takes place in early June. This is the
occasion when. \u25a0 the most virtuous
maiden of the parish receives a. rose In
acknowledgment of her goodness, and
receives likewise a dowry, which has
been provided either by the cure or by
some, kindhearted aristocrat of the
countryside. .
The- crowning of the Rosiere Is. always
a charming festival, even though the
rustic queen of virtue who has been
chosen Is homely, and utterly without
grace of, mannerâ which is usually true,
ofcourse, else she would not be, so sur
passingly good. Dressed all In white,
she goes through the streets . on the
Mayor's arm, followed by a procession
of white-robed maidens bearing gar
lands of : flowers. . ... "._. , '%
With appropriate ceremony, the
Mayor presents to. her the/ crown of
roses, the dowry which. has been pro
vided, and possibly a little gift of his
own, as a souvenir of the occasion.
. Sometimes the festival ends in a wed
ding, and / the ..Roslero becomes the
happy bride. of some rustic' suitor, who
appreciated her virtues even before
they won her a dot,.

A \/weHenouÂ«h to. run out for a visit
to "their country home without a spe
cial invitation on the pccaslon' of each
call. When he boarded the train across
the bay- last Sunday, morning he ex
perienced never a fear lest the Mortons
should by a chance be away from home.
A ; dreamy Sunday in the country, filled
with brilliant sunshine and. perfumed
with air the fragrance of the summer
flowers, was sufficient attraction to
keep any one at home, if that home
was an ideal one of shaded verandas,
cool rooms and magnificent vistas of
country. \u25a0
It was a long walk .from the station
up to the Mortons' home, but Rivers
took it leisurely,
chuckling at a- lit^
tie surprise that
he was planning on
the Morton girls.
Fate, however, took
a hand in the game,
taking â¢ the jok<
from Rivers. He
wondered idly why,
there was no one
on the verandas.j
"At church," he de
cided, as he saun
tered up the walk.
He tried the screen 1
door and found it
locked. Then he
rang the , bell. - It
was a Wng time be
fore there was any
answer. Rivers had
ensconced : himself
in one of the easy
chairs when the
butler opened the
door.

"No, sir." said the
butler, "they have

York and the entire

over to the city and
will dine at one ot

' When the butler had departed. Rivers
lolled back in mirthful enjoyment of the
situation. For the time being he was
monarch. of all that he surveyed. And
\u25a0here he was trespassing on the property
of another, the recipient of hospitality a
little out of the ordinary. He found. the
pleasure of his. own reflections more de
lightful than the novels and magazines'
on the table before him.
"Luncheon is served." announced the
butler, as if a score of people were await
ing his summons. Rivers took the place
at the head of . the table. As he peopled
in his fancy the three Morton Â«irls seat
ed around the table, he decided that he
was. lonely. There \ was Elizabeth, gray
eyed, and black-haired, the, artist of the
family; there was Marcia. the .laughter

\u25a0was demure Polly, of the-flnffy organdies

As squalling infants we start out In life
And have the measles and the croup,.
We learn to whittle with a little knife
Or play with, dolls or roll the hoop;
We play with tiny pistols, harmless toys.
And eat green apples by the peck,
And that is why ao . many little boys
Are doomed to. get it in the neck, -
For life's a funny proposition, after all.
We hike to school and learn a lot, no
doubt.
If we will study hard enough;
And by and by our teachers turn us out
To face the world so hard and rough.
And then we find how little that we
, '\u25a0 know,
How .small the part we have to play.
For we are not the whole thing in the
show, '
But just a greenhorn and a Jay,
For life's 4a4 a funny proposition, after all.
And after while we fall In love, of course,
\u25a0And think the one we love divine;
We marry,. then we ask for a divorce.
For that now seems. to be in line;
Our dream of love is shattered and we
sigh '
And mope around a year . or two,
And maybe wed ..another by and, by,
The way a lot of others do.
For life's a funny proposition, after all.
Old age comes on and we are bent and
gray.
We totter sadly to the grave,
And we are not so bright and blithe and
gay : ,
Nor yet so keen or quick or brave;
We have no teeth with which to chew the
rag..
Our legs are bent with rheumatiz;
We .have no breath with which to blow or
brag,
We talk of was and not of Is,
And life's a funny proposition, after all.

THE TOUGH STEAK.
Richard Harding Davis, when he was
a reporter in Philadelphia, delighted to
disguise himself as a "tough" young
nian and to mingle with the odd char
acters of the Ninth street district of the
Quaker city. w '
"'" ' Mr. Davis got to know this district
with, peculiar Intimacy., Its prize fight
ers he knew especially well. Not sel
dom, in the gathering of some odd news
item, he would accompany a third-rate
pugilist to , his cheap* boarding-house
and dine with him on the most unpala
table fare. .
"I used to know one fighter," said Mr.
Davis recently, "who was a character,
wit, a man of- no mean Intellect.
| "Ono day I \ dined . with him at his
boarding-house, a- typical boarding
house â one. of those where the*land
lady sits at . the head of the table arid
serves the .dishes to the submissive
pensioners ranged in two lines below
her. '
. "My friend got a piece of steak that
was'full^of gristle. 'Finding the steak
intolerably tough, he began to amuse
us , all .. with burlesque attempts at carv
ing 'it. ;' He turned : back his cuffs and
carved. " Then he took" off his coat. Then
he held: his knife like a chisel and pre
tended to hammer. the handle with a bis
cuit.
-' "The .landlady, up to this moment,
had been too busy, serving ; to notice
the. pugilist's antics. Now she spoke
J "/Is, there anything the matter with
your, steak?' she said in a stern voice.

E. J. Quillinan, Solicitor and
Erstwhile Actor, Arrested
on a Charge of Larceny
Committed in Los Angeles
MAY CAUSE WEDDING
TO BE POSTPONED
Pawn Ticket f or Sweetheart's
Watch and a Very Loving
Note From Bride-to-Be Are
Found on His Person
It was the habit of borrowing goods
from other* and then | pawning them,
\u25a0pending the money thus raised for scor
geuuH raiment, with which to clothe his
athletic figure, that caused the arrest of
Kdivuni J. <tuil!liiiiD, erstwhile actor
and sometime collector,, last night on a
warrant from Los Angeles charging him
with theft. ' Qullliiuiu left the southern
city some | time ago and came to San
Francisco to find â¢ new friends from
nliiim be could conveniently borrow
anything on ' which he could raise
real money. Pretty Miss Va-
Hne Fisher fell victim to bU
charms and In the evident intensity of
genulue love she promised to marry
him. Promptly Q,uilllnan borrowed her
gold -match, her very proudest posses
sion. Without losing any time Quilll
nan took the golden' timepiece to a
pawnbroker and realized S5 50 on it.
With this money in his' pocket he was
about to enter the home of his fiancee,
at 34&9 Jackson street, when he was ar
rested by Detectives Braig and Taylor.
They took him to the Hall of Justice and
it was there that his newly found sweet
heart discovered him. Great was her
surprise when she was told that her
watch was among the long list of pawned 1
articles disposed of by her imprisoned
lover. She was Indignant and it follows
that the wedding scheduled to take place
August 16 may not be celebrated. In the
coat pocket of Quillinan was. the follow
ing letter, which Miss Fisher admits hav
ing written:
'1 My Darling: If you have won your. wager
then you are asleep because It .is exactly 9
o'clock. Are you dreaming of me? Ah, my
husband, I know that you love me as I love
you. I am so cross sometimes. For Instance,
to-day. Never at you, though. I keep the
little notes you wrote in my own private box.
They are from you; from you, love. Here
at my desk I sit and . dream, dream of you,
of our meeting, of our pleasures together, of
our love, of your kisses, of mine, of every
thing touching upon our lives since first we
met. of our life together after the 16th of
August. Up hill and down. Cares, sorrows,
Joys. Ah. love, will you ever wish we did
not meet? I hope not, trust not. \u25a0 Love
drives away all petty things. The great, love
surges in my heart and my heart beats
faster as I dream here alene of the one man
of my love, asleep, perhaps, under San Fran
cisco skies. My poor darling tired for my
sake. But love, I will repay you, with kisses
and love. The tired head In my arms. My
lips on yours. Ah, love. â¢ dear love. My
husband. I, am your wife and always I shall
remember while the light lives and in the
darkness I shall not forget. Good night, love.
YOUR WIFE.
S "When the detectives received word to
arrest Quillinan they learned that he
was employed as a solicitor in this city.
Upon making inquiry they ascertained
that he had not been at the office where
he was supposed to work for two . days
and they planned to arrest him at the
home of â¢ his fiancee. Just as he was
about, to ring the door bell he was de
tained and taken to prison. Miss Fisher
was anxious to learn all about the charge
and asked permission to visit the prisoner
to-day.' Quillinan, who gives . his resi
dence as 647 Fell street, says he; has been
an actor for about ten years. He claims
to have played : leading parts with Flor
ence Stone at the Grand Opera House in
this city and asserts that he played an
engagement at the Burbank Theater in
Los Angeles about one year ago, .He dis
claims all knowledge of the charge made
against him In 1 Los Angeles and says that
he has not been in that city since he
closed at the Burbank. He immediately
sent word to his cousin,' Attorney James
,B. Feehan, whose offices are in the Par

Alec Wates, thfy Absconding
Ticket Agent, Makes Good
His Foolish Peculations
ATONES FOE HIS PAST
Old Friends Keceiye Good
News -From Man They
Had So Long \u25a0 Kespected
A pleasant bit of news was' furnished
the railroad "traffic men along the \ street:
yesterday in the announcement' that Alec
Waters, the former clty.;ticket agent of
the Pacific Coast Steamship .Company,
who absconded -four years ago after a'
reckless night career^ln'- the tenderloin,
had settled in full his shortage with,. the
steamship company, and: had' properly
atoned for a number of breaches of trust
among the railroad men, who had re
garded him as a friend. . .
Waters' sudden, disappearance from
this city was a great surprise " to his
many friends, who had welcomed him
as an associate and worthy of every
confidence that one man could repose
in another. The fact that he had stolen
his employer's money, and then, on the
eve of his flight, borrowed money from
his most Intimate friends upon {misrep
resentations, for a time caused the
erring young fellow" to be bitterly con?
demned, but later, when it was learned
that he had gone to a secluded place
in the East and was trying to , repay
the money he had misappropriated and
live down the past, the sympathy of his
former associates in this city, where he
was extremely popular, was extended
to him. ''-.-:\u25a0
That this sympathy was not misplaced
is now evidenced in Waters' act of reim
bursing those who suffered by his pecu
lations- It is not the practice of the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company to. revive
the past failings of its employees who
have gone wrong, but In Waters' case
it was deemed just to him that his latest
act should be made public in order that
It should redound to his credit. WaterÃ
is now in New York, enjoying lucrative
employment In a big instltijton, where he
has been quietly struggling for several
months to save the necessary money with
which to erase from memory the sad
termination of what four years ' ago ap
peared to be a most promising career for
one of the brightest young traffic men in
this city. â¢ '.. \u25a0

KING STRIVING
TO SAVE CROWN
teorge II of Tonga Would
Persuade Edward of Engr
land to Keep Hands Off
VESSEL'S SLOW TRIP
Schooner William Olsen Ar
rives From the South Seas
After a Tedious Passage
~ The schooner William Olsen, which ar
rived yesterday from the Friendly Isl
inde, made a long passage home, light
.Kinds having prevailed throughout the
run. She was sixty-five days coming
trom Nukuloffa. She brought 460 tons
it copra. .
The king of Tonga, chief of the Friend
ly Islands, is at present in New Zealand
trying to save his throne, says Captain
Rovrik, from the machinations of a few
British politicians who are engaged in
business on the Friendly islands. King
George II Is probably the largest mon
arch in the world. He is 32 years old.
stands more than 6 feet high and
weighs over SOO pounds.
The Friendly Islands are under the pro
tection of Great Britain and the English
residents want the British Government to
take full charge. At their request King
Edward's high commissioner of the South
Seas visited Nukuloffa and tried to per
suade King George to accept a pension
and allow Kins: Edward to do the rul
ing. Georjre refused. The high commis
sioner then virtually deposed the king
and banished the prime minister and sec
retary of state. British Vice "Consul
Hamilton Hunter was placed in charge
of the government.
. George has been a peaceful monarch
and has neither army nor navy with
which to keep King Edward's grasp off
his . poor little kingdom. So he packed
his Saratoga and dress suit case, placed
his crown in the safety deposit vault,
and with his constitution in his pocket
took steamer for New Zealand, where he
hopes to find friends to plead his cause
at the court of his less bulky but fairer
complexioned and more powerful brother
monarch.
% George II has found the king busi
ness little but trial and tribulation.
Shortly after he ascended the throne the
keeper of the royal treasury skipped out
with most of the movable assets of the
kingdom. VThat would have been bad
enough, but the defaulter took with him ;
the royal navy, which was found later |
wrecked on a nearby coral reef.
Captain Rovrtk of the William Olsen
found a peculiar state of affairs. Ameri
can canned goods and other products of:
the United States are in big demand, but j
the merchants are doing all in their j
power to discourage trade - with this
country. Great Britain exercises super
vision over the islands and the British j
traders have every possible advantage, j
but it is the German traders who ara j
doing most business and making most
money. The land is fruitful, the climate
perfect and the trade worth going after.
"But if Americans do not go after it,'
said Captain Rovrik. "it will never
come to them as long as the men now in
real control have anything to say.' -
Tornado Will Go Pearl Flahlngf.
The Â«chcx>ner Tornado, ence the Baranoff.
later the Rover, sometime trader and once-ln
a^while pleasure yacht. Is being fitted out at
Howard-street bulkhead for the pearl fishing
trade. She will sail Sunday for La Paz in
the Gulf of California, which hereafter will be
her home port. She was built for the Alaska
Commercial Cciaapny. who named her Bara
noft and used her in northern waters in con
nection with some concessions from the Rus-
Bian Government. When these concessions
were withdrawn the BarancS was sold to Cap
tain Tithian of Santa Barbara, who used her
at i a yacht and on board her made several
cmiees" to the South Seas. The BaranoÃ was
famous as a fleet caller and once winged her
way from Santa Barbara to Tahiti in fifteen
dare. Commodore Gutte bought the Baranoff
fend renamed her Rover. Under that name she
made several trips to Mexico, but lived, on the
whdle. a life of comparative leisure. The
Compania Pcrllfera of La Paz now owns the
schooner. The name has been chanced to
Tornado, the better to harmonize with Cyclone.
another schooner of the Mexican company's
fleet. The Tornado has been fitted with a new
mainmast and her internal arrangements have
been completely changed to suit the trade in
which *he is to engage. She will sail on Sun
day and it is more than likely that she will
leave port in company with the General Ban
ning, a schooner in the Tornado's class. As
far as Maratlan the schooners travel the same
road and - the caotaln of each is determined
that his boat will be first around Cape San
Luces. Captain Green will command the
Tornado.
Chancri Color With tbe Foe
In response to freauent requests from the
pilots of thÂ« ferry steamers the Harbor Com
missioners a few days ago painted white the
end of the shed on Mission-street wharf. At
sight and in thick weather it Is sometimes
a little difficult for the ferryboat pilot com
ing from the Oakland eide to get his bearings
and. locate the slip assigned to his boat. The
big white patch on the end of the wharf was
Juet what they wanted and it was with feel
ings of gratitude that the pilots watched the
painters at work. For a few days the paint
retained its original whiteness. Tbe first heavy
fog. howe t ci . clianged the color to a neutral
tint, which was net visible as far as the
former * red paint had been. When the sun
comes out the whiteness returns, but in foggy
weather, when the whiteness Is wanted, there
Is no whiteness there. It will not bother the
pilots long, however, as already the white
coat Is peeling off and in a few days the red
paint underneath will all be visible again.

The Supervisors Joint Street and Fi
nance Committee yesterday received a
communication from ' the 1 Board of "Works
stating j that TAlva -B: Clute is" not prop
erly. * carrying J out - his contract:, to fur
nish "wagons, to remove street sweepings.
The letter says: :"
AÂ» It. is evident that ths contractor furnish
ing wagons to ', remove ;\u25a0 sweepings -trora . our
streets. .. under > a â¢ contract entered into : with
him by. your ' board, cannot . perform 1 properly
such * work -. and i refuse ; is accumulating to -an
offensive extent 0.1 a 'great number of streets,
our s weepers ' are retarded *. thereby and such
streets \ are . becoming > more : offensive \u25a0* for the
need, of^ the -removal; of this refuse: therefore
this; board would ; request of your board, as
this contract Is -of : your l making, that you
.' take â¢ the > necessary steps T to compel your con
tractor , to properly, perform his > work bo: that
we may be able to properly sweep our streets.
: The â committee received an offer from
C. S. -Harney to sell the city, nine wagons
of a' larger capacity than Clute furnishes
for 11350, which offer Braunhart and Con
nor " fa vo red and agreed to pay for the
wagons out of .the fund for expenses
of .'acquiring.-, public; utilities. The com
mittee accepted the offer and the wagons
will r pressed Into, service at once, the
requisition for the -necessary teams to
be made by Superintendent Cowden, who
thinks that/all refuse will be removed
from now* on. . -~.T^'.'
.The Board, of Works was authorized to
enter into a contract with the, Spring
: Valley i Company -to furnish water for
; sprinkling . at $500 per month. .Â»* V
The â¢ committee (agreed to purchase out
of thfe 'urgent \u25a0 necessity fund six street
sprinkling machines for $1250 : from C. S.

j The', committee accepted the offer of
the Tftllabt- Banking. Company. to sell for
$11,000/ land at the ; southwest corner" of
Chestnut and Montgomery streets for the

; quested the City Attorney to solicit offers

chase^fiJJgHP ...-,Â» -. â¢ :
The Â£ Street Committee considered the
, petition -of the Sari; Francisco Electric
j. Protective' Company., for a ftfty-year
. franchise ;- for a district telegraph and.
messenger service. : ;â¢ H." N. Goodall. presi
dent. 1 of Â»the company, stated that the
Cit>\ Attorney \u25a0 had that a fran
chise" s >nlust :" be '^Obtained r under the
. "Broughton- act" ; after a sale thereof to
the highest bidder. Braunhart said he
was .'opposed: to granting . the franchise
because :'it would drive the ; established
Calif ornia -â¢ and . American District Mes
senger companies "out of business, they
having been' granted the privilege by
oruinances previous [ tc> the . passage of
theÂ° Broughton â¢ act- and the adoption of
the : charter." The company's attorney ar-^
gued - that - to grant " another franchise
would not. interfere^" with; tfte existing
messengerj companies, .whose privileges
are ' Irrevocable. , .The ; committee appeared
to be Impressed with.. this argument ."and
Instructed the company, to prepare a pro
posal notice ' for ? the ; sale of _^tbe fran
chise,^ which, 'however, j will --not "be j" re
garded " as being ;an exclusive privilege.
The: committee .then took the petition un
der, advisement for; five weeks, as - the
Supervisors -,wlll. take a vacation begin
ning ; next . Monday. . * :
The committee authorized the Board of
Works to \u25a0 construct a 'driveway. -from

Convention in New York
NEW YORK. July 26.-The news that
nearly two million email wage earners of
America are learning to save out of their
liule incomes and to administer these
savings in large collective amounts as
â¢veil as any trust company with great
capitalistic backing could do the same
\u25a0work was contained in the address of
President A. D. Guthiel before the an
nual convention of the United Building
and Loan Associations to-day.. The
league is an association of more than five
thotaanfl local building and loan associa
tions. President Guthiel I*. from-Shelby
ville, Ind. He said in part:
"Thfe ideality of .the local system of
building and roan associations lies in the
fact that they are -, operated in the im
mediate vicinity wherein dwell the share
holders and officers. "Nine-tenths of the
officers cf'such institutions 6erve with
out pay. The shareholders and officers
are all personally known to each other
and each shareholder can know, from
month to month exactly how his money
Js invested. They have no paid agents to
drum uj> business and only Email* sal
aries sufficient to keep the machinery
in running order." "â¢-<.'
R. F. Celtarius of Cincinnati, Ohio, sec
retary of the league. In his annual re
port says: ; . -; . -
"Ti-.e la&t.year. oas been successful {or

cf the Dullding and loan associations ' in
the-pnited States Is $600,342,568, which is
& net Increase for the year of J23.756,

net Increase of 64,548. The number of

Third, the board finds upon . careful con :
Â«iaÂ«ratlon of the reports of all classes of corre

a .reduction in planted acreage as compared
with last year of 14.9 PÂ«r cent (Instead ot 11.4

Trade and Stocks.
The "NeTf Tork circular of J. S. Bache &

. 'Aocthe the plgiron market is -active at ad

Vinab&led Â«3emand and premiums for delivery
i '"will . become more common in the next few
~W6Â«kÂ«, a better feeling prevails In the lighter
grades of finished M<?eL Illustrative of the
stability .cf the steel tituation it Is worth
wfcl]Â» remembering that the United States
Steel Corporation in the first Â«lx months of
\u25a0 the year earned the full year's interest
charges, flepreciaiicn allowances and the <3iv
:ct:*i oa the pref*rr*d stock, and the balance
*cf the year promises even better. . The one
Â£xcÂ«ption to general prosi^rity is the bitumin
ous coal trade, and this Is largely local In
effect. . .
"That "thÂ« prices of thÂ« active rtocks hare
â¢Advanced an ivraee of 7 points during June
and July is fiufficient in itself to impress upon
uh~ n:!nd the necessity for caution during the
rem&ir.ine- summer months. \u25a0 In only three
years !n the last thirty has euch a condition
'â¢enrronted us. and it must be remembered
that reports of damage to- the pro-wing crops
\u25a0are periodical, often exaggerated or untrue,
â¢ but nevertheless temporarily very real influ
ences on prices. It is. of course, significant
\u25a0of the ultimate outcome that the leadinsr rail

determined whether It is to be another year
"of TM-ofirierHy' or a year of slackened business.
ATe are certain to have crop scares and crop
scares mean lower prices. But they also mean
bargains should the outcome be favorable.
The purchaser of standard utiares on recessions

Xew York Stock Market. ;
NEW YORK. July HO.â .1 slight stirrlnr of
interest in the Erie stocks to-day scarcely
&3**\-Â«d to move ;he ceneral market in eym-
TSthy. , Conviction was- strong that dividends
anera.' Tv be inaugurated on Erie second pre-.
*fcr â¢ **\u25a0) BTid -"ccnjectui* -was tfioÂ«tly t>onflned.
M -th*' rate at which the initial dl\iderid would
be plaop<l, but the" !*?liÂ«>t In !he ErlÂ» second
t>r^iÂ«rtr<vi dii-itiend has be*n a factor in the
\u25a0-rr.atlo**. \u25a0 *Â«>r ::.i.:'y wÂ«?ekÂ». and the uniform
ir.diS<-rÂ«n<x- with -tvhich recent dividend in- :
cretUÃCp hBve lx*n ireatÂ«-d did not offer â¢ much
â¢ ncouraÂ£Â« i Ti!Â»'nt to .look . for a wide movement
in the Erics following action 'bo long ex
pf>ciÂ»?d. The buying cf the three claps-'.-* of
th* stoc*k of the company came from but few
fourct-a and was attributed to one or two of
thÂ« larger traders who werp unable to find any
â¢ Â»thÂ«-r stock for which any motives existed for
a- ",radÂ«rs' movement. The unrespensivenes*
of xhe "Cr.ifd States Steel stocks tv the quar
terly PtB-ternÂ«Â»nt of -net earn'.ng-<, -published late
,Â«-vs:erdaj\ was an additional r*-ason for sk^p
â¢Licisin 6v*r the power of news ior.g expected
to mm prices. â¢
Tlife quarterly report was* favorably com
-inentfxl upon and was considered to make a
strong showing. The lack of response In the
corporation's stock was thought to be due pos
sibly to the fact thst some of the over
ranguine estimates of speculators had pointed
to r.tt fsrninj*! for the quarter as high as
\u25a0 - $:-i2.000,00e. in place of the $3i>.305.11Â«5 actually
reported. But thfn there was tstimates ><Â«
ter<iay as low as fiS.cOO.OOO. The decrease' in
the vnlame of unfilled orders on hand com
pared with the hf-ginnix*-*- of the previous quar
ter was coru-idt-red moderate In view of the
lu*l known to have occurred in the trade, and
th* brtlef is t-revalent that thÂ«re has been
fomethicK like a rush of orders since the first
of the month. That holders of etockft are
\u25a0nut equally indifferent to bad news of special
proprrties ijÂ« Indicated by the occasional sharp
fcreakg in s-x-cialties. Pitttburg Coal pre
fiened declined to a new low level to-day as a
rcs-ult nf the au!-jÂ»enslun of Its dividends. The
cotton market was thrown Into some excite
-nient aram to-day by tho publication of thÂ»
Oovernmpnt'e revistd ftKUi-es of the crop acre
Â«fÂ», and the yellow fever outbreak in New
Orleans Â»waÂ« the sul-ject of discussion, with
a slight effect nf rtc-prfSEion on tsntnc of the
South'. m railroad stocks. . .. .
News from grain crojjs continue favorable.
-Mf'nry.reinair* ea?y. but foreign exchange
retes rose, and there U a EUi.posltlun that
rorae of th<> Japanese loan proceeda are being
remitted abroad.
. The establishment of Erie second preferred
on â¢ 4 s**r cent divlder-d basts was accord
ing to the beet exptctations, but the declara
ticn ,-of the dividend for a full year at this
time with crovieion for payment on the two
inpt-Ulm^nte. was a general surprise. The
Eri*-s rose In consequence in the final deal
ings.. .Â»t which time the dtvidend Was an
nounced, and mad* the closing firm. â¢.
Bonds were steady. Total sales, par value,
$1.976.000., â¢
United States bor.ds were unchanged on call.

Â»vr York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, July 20.â COTTONâ The cot
ton market to-day showed a very nervous
tone. There was continual uncertainty about
the issuance of the revised acreage reduc
tions and likewise \u25a0 continual speculation us
to whether the Government rejx>rt would be
bullish or bearish. ' Upon the publication of
the revised figure 14.0 decreased . acreage
against 11.4 in the report of June 3, tho
market immediately advanced 20 points, but
met with a tremendous volume of liquida
tion sales which carried prices down stead
ily to tho close. The situation for the next
few days is liable to be unsettled. To-day' 6
report rectifies thft discrepancy - made in the
June report.- which was doctored 'to facili
tate gambling transactions of unscrupulous
persons, and will give the \u25a0\u25a0 -trade-' a- better
basis for calculating: the crop ; situation and
outlook when the August report on the con- 1
dltion of the plant la published on the 3d
prox. ... . . , -. â¢ ( . ; = \u25a0
\u25a0 To-day's report means n crop of at best
not over ten million bales. It Is the'itmallest
acreage and the lowest condition for six
years.

Hay and Feedstuff*.
There is no . further "change !n â¢ Feedstufts.
Receipts or Hay- were lighter, but the recent.
excessive arrivals ; have given -\u25a0 the market all
the supply*, it can carry lor some days yet.
'; The circular of Somers & Co. fays:
S 'â¢Receipts for the past -week , have : been ex
ceedingly heavy, showing a total of SGOO tons,
in comparison with 1 * SCOO for the week pre
ceding. These arrivals are almost 100 pÂ«r cent i
greater, than the daily â¢ consumption conse
quently, as very few people are* stocking up,
matters have been In exceedingly bad shape
here. -.Choice Wheat Hay alone holds its own,
although ' there is some little weakening even
with . this grade. Other kinds of Hay are un
deniably lower, : more especially with Wheat
Hay of good -quality,' which- heretofore hasr
been selling at < from $11 to $13 now quotable
at from $0 50 to $10 50. From all indications,
this \u25a0 rush . will continue for. some j little .' time,,
at least as long as transportation can be fur
nished, although at the present writing, the
sidetracks' assigned . for "Hay axe completely,
filled. " There- are large quantities . of-- Hay in
most districts that must be marketed here
owing, to lack of storage facilities, and en the
whole prospects are not at all encouraging, j
- "Hay from the lowland districts; which hava
yielded very heavily this season,' continues to
come by water and finds a market only at ex-,
tremely low figures, practically below the cost'
of \u25a0\u25a0 production. : \u25a0 :. . â¢, ,'
"All indications at present, therefore are
toward a continued depressed, or- even lower,
market, and. we can see nothing In the way of
export trade or outside demand to relieve the
situation.*' '

SCHERF GUILTY,
DECLARES JURY
Mother Causes Sympathy and
Life Imprisonment for the
Murderer ;Is the Penalty
DELIBERATION IS BRIEF
Only Thirty-Five Minutes
Required. to Decide Fate
of Slayer of Schultze
The trial of Gustavo Scherf. charged
with the murder of Rudolph Schultze,
wae ended yesterday, and after thirty
flve minutes of deliberation the Jury re
turned a verdict of "cullty <jf murder in
the first degree and fixed the penalty at
imprisonment for life." Saturday was
fixed as the time for passing sentence.
That the full penalty of the law was
not imposed by the Jury, which has the
power to fix the punishment in all
verdicts of murder in the first degree, is
attributable to the sympathy the pres
ence of Scherfs aged mother aroused.
Throughout the argument of Assistant
District Attorney Ferral to the Jury,
Ecberf and his mother cried Quietly.
Their weeping continued throughout the
entire noon hour. On the reading of the
verdict at 6:18 o'clock last night, both
Scherf and his mother cobbed aloud.
BcherfÃ crime was the cold-Wooded
murder of Schultze August 24, ISO 4. The
trial web delayed, by an appeal to the
Federal courts, but when begun It occu
pied a week. Not an extenuating circum
stance in favor of the murderer was
brought to light and his defense was
shown to be oontradlctory and false.
When the case was called yesterday
morning Policeman Richard Ennis testi
fied fcr the defense as to the occasion a
year ago, when two horses belonging to
the Schultzes were impounded, and it was
alleged that one of the Schultzes drew a
knife on Poundmaster Irwin. Ennis said
that he saw no display of force when he
reached the scene.
Policeman James "W. Boyle was called
In rebuttal to impeach the testimony
given by the defendant on Tuesday.
Boyle, who Is official etenographer at po

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
â¢ When one of the bailiffs of Police Judge
Conlan's court requested James ' J. Kelly
to ;step" forth from the- crowded cage, ; . a
dapper little man with - \ smooth-shaven
face stood up and said, "'Professor*/
James J. Kelly, if you â¢ please." t.'i ;' .. ,
â¢'Prof essor . what?" | inquired," the ' Judge
when Mr. Kelly was placed "before him;
"Of high diving," was- the prompt.. re :
ply. "I have the honor of holding; the
world's championship, won/" by Y diving
from the loftiest height; ever attempted.
It may Interest you to ieara that Ibave
just come from Portland, where my per
formance was tne sensation of ; the fair."
"T3iat Is of less' interest to me thanks
your plea to this charge of; having bat
tered a young woman at"* o'clock' this
mornteg on Kearny street." . , -
"Oh, not guilty, of course,"- said Pro
fessor Kelly. ;_
When the Judge inquired If the battered
young woman, registered as Miss May
Young, was present to testify,' Patrolman
J. E. Reade answered In the negative.
"I arrested her and another girl with this
defendant," the cop ' said, "but she got
out on bail and is not; here."
"And it's useless to try. to get her
here," chimed in the other youngwoman,
registered as Miss Eleanor Elliott.
"Why is -it useless?" the bench asked.
"Because she's asleep; â¢ and , I ' tell you
that when May once gets her head on
the pillow it is waste of time to. attempt
to rouse her. I have tried it more than
once, but, no, sir, no waking up for May
till she gets good and ready. Talk about
your sound sleepers! , She's the/ limit!"
Despite this- positive \ declaration ; the
Judge issued a bench ; warrant : for Miss
Young's arrest and instructed Patrolman
Reade to have her in court to-day, even
though it should be necessary to bring
her couch along with her.
"Before, we go any further 'with, this
thing," said Miss Elliott, "I'd- l.ke to
know why I was kept in jail and' May let
out. I ain't no stage singer, as she Is,
but I guess I have rights." Then she
volunteered the information - that she
came from Humboldt County, where her
family is widely known and highly' - es
teemed, and. she hoped ; her relatives
would not learn of her. arrest. 'What did
I have to do with the scrap, ""any way?' ..."
she indignantly demanded: "If j this Pro
fessor and May happen to . have trouble,
is that any reason why : I should be
pinched with them?".
Professor Kelly, asked' for and obtained
permission to inform the court that his
alleged battery on Miss Young consisted
solely of an endeavor to disarm her'of a
hatpin with which she was' Playfully try-,
ing to puncture his face. .- . >>
Then the ease was continued till to
day. ' ' \u25a0 .-,.\u25a0â¢.. /.
Charles D.- Chance, a good-looking
young fellow, pleaded that it. was -in "re
sponse to invitation from / his V divorced
wife, now Miss Belle. Quareles.' that he
visited her. home, .730 Octavia- street; i and
that she took possession; of his; hat -and
refused to surrender, it; until he wrested
it from her, which was the only assault
he committed, although she had him , ar
rested qn, the ; charge of ; having/ violently
slapped! her- face. To., which- Miss Quar
eles retorted; by /.emphatically denying
that she fipnt:for him tojvlsit her. -
Tho defendant, complained- to Judge
Cabaniss! that ) the attorney "who advo-
cated t his cause \in the divorce suit was
there as special . counsel j for j the prosecu
tion, -which >: he s considered unfair, inas
much as the lawyer in question had ob
tained his \ (defendant's) confidence. 'The
Judge said ;that he also considered the
attorney's position ;reprehensible, r but it
did not disprove -the charge of battery.
So a ' $10 fine . was ' Imposed > and paid. . â¢
Walter^ Clark's ignorance of the legal
modus operandi of divorce was piti
fully crass/ else he would not have in
vited "his wife, an actress at the Em
pire to accompany , him to the
Hall of Justice and there formally/re
linquish all - claim .to his protection.
She accepted the invitation, but Instead
of aiding Walter to sever their marital
tie she placed him in custody, on a
chargeof drunkenness, which wasnot
belied by his appearance and demeanor,
j When; the case was called- before
Judge Fritz the lady, whose stage name
was not disclosed, intimated a desire to
have her spouse "soaked" for as long
a. term as the law would permit; be
cause he had not even pretended to
earn a livelihood: for himself so long
as she earned it for him. He was an
actor,; she declared, but the profession
was hot dignified by his membership.
The Judge promised to sentence him to

Seventeen-year-old Herbert Park de
nledmost;strenuously that he was the
mischievous person /who frightened' J.
P. Conlan's children and' other Juvenile
residents* on .the 200 block of Hoffman
avenue by: "sicking", dogs to bite them
and also by donning a, mask and bran
dishing a knife. \u25a0 Not'only was he guilt
less of the conduct averred- by Conlan
pere, Master Park .declared, but he was
totally ignorant of the identity of the
person who was guilty of it. Indeed, he
would go ; further by swearing* that he
did not ' know such conduct", had ', been
committed- until he j was - accused ( of it.
If he were given time-to prove acom
plete alibi he would do so. Judge Fritz
gave him a week to make good his
word. . * / . .
Mr. Conlan, however, was very posi
tive j that Master *. Park was the author
of his children's terror. The urging of
the dog to bite them was bad enough,
but'the mask and. knife; act could not
be . too strongly condemned, j inasmuch
as it had scared his little f daughter into
hysteria, from. which | she -hasj not ,'yet
entirely recovered. Judge said he
appreciated* the gravity of the offense.

Swearing So a
Pilot Could Get a License
. UnltedJ States Secret Service Agent
Richard H. Taylor, who was sent to this
city to -unearth | naturalization frauds
and bring" the conspirators to/justice,
ran another quarry to earth " yesterday
afternoon.: The prisoner is William J.
Cawley, proprietor of a saloon at 124
East street. The charge against him
is perjury, alleged to have been com
mitted in Superior Judge :. Frank H.
Kerrigan's court on December 29, 1903,
when Cawley appeared as a witness for
Herman Van Busse, an applicant for
naturalization papers. It- is . charged
that Cawley swore he had known Van
Busse to have resided in this country
for five years preceding the date, when
In fact Cawley knew that Van Busse
had. not lived in the United States more
than one year and nine months. Upon
the strength of the naturalization cer
tificate, issued by reason of . Cawley's
testimony Van Busse was granted a li
cense as master and'pllot. only citizens
of- the United" States being ' eligible to
such license on American vessels. Caw
ley was arrested by Deputy, United
States Marshal George H. Burnham at
the . request of Agent Taylor. The
prisoner was taken to the City Prison
at 4 4 o'clock, 'pending the arrival of
bondsmen ; for ' $3000.
There are more 'than, a score of ad
ditional, arrests, to be made on similar
complaints to be filed by Agent Taylor,
who has been working day. and night to
secure evidence to convict this con
spirators. The United States District
Attorney declares that Agent Taylor
has- built up an impregnable prosecu
tion against the accused persons al
ready under arrest. >It is known that
several other fraudulently naturalized
masters and pilots are now plying their
calling on American -vessels touching
at this port. Some of these persons are
now on the high' seas on ' the way

TO PAY LICENSES ON
650 STREET CARS
United Railroads Will. Have
Liability for Additional
Charges Determined.
The joint Supervisors' Committee on
Licenses and. Finance yesterday con
sidered the protest filed by the United
Railroads "against: the proposed, exac
tion by Tax Collector Scott of licenses
on 804 cars. Scott said his deputies
had made an: actual count of the num
ber ; of cars, \u25a0 together with the expert
of the: Grand Jury, and found the total
to be 804.';" Scott said the ordinance im
poses a license on passenger cars
whether they are in use or not.
General Manager ; Chapman stated
that"the company kept 438 cars in ac
tual operation and 563 cars was the
maximum number ever used. Twenty
five per cent of theBo4 cars.are in the
repair shops or temporarily, out of com
mission. Chapman said licenses are be
ing paid on 650 cars, which he consid
ered ~a fair number to pay on. Chap
man said some of the franchises of the
company. only required licenses to be
paid on' cars actually used.
Chapman asked that the ordinance be
amended so .that licenses, shall be col
lected on streetcarsactually used. Su
pervisor Payot said: the; difference
amounted- to J12250 yearly,, but Chap
man said the principle of the proposi
tion is involved. The committee re
fered the question of the cars that are
exempted from licenses under- fran
chises to the City- Attorney for an'opin
ion. Chapman agreed to pay licenses
on 650 cars and file a communication
setting forth trie. company's position in
the: premises. As aj beginning: thirty
cars; will be sold for old junk to avoid
payment of licenses on them.
