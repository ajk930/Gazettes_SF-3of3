was drowne'd to-day at Manhattan
beach near Redondo while .bathing in
the surf. He lost his life only after
a heroic effort had been made to. save
him by W. Anderson, one of. his em-.
ploy#s, Anderson remaining with the
drowning i..an until only the absolute
necessity of saving his own life caused
him to release his hold. -,
Homer and Anderson, tor. ether with
a large party of the employes of the
company, went to the beach for a day's
outing and seven members of the party
went into the surf. Horner was a
strong swimmer and he swam out be
yond the shore waves and called
Anderson to him. Before Anderson
reached him Horner began calling for
help. Anderson immediately respond
ed and a desperate battle â¢ with- the
waves began. Horner weighed about
200 pounds and he seeu.ed utterly un
able to help himself, but with Ander
son's assistance he floated on his back
for fully fifteen minutes while the latter
strove heroically to get out of the rough
breakers with his burden. '
Two others broke into the boat house
nearby and pulled out an old boat, but
the craft was leaky and tne struggling
pair of human beings in the water
could not be 'reached. All efforts to
save the men with ropes failed. The
two were pounded in the breakers and
frequently separated, but not until
Horner turned over face. forward and
gave up the fight did. Anderson desert

self. Thoroughly' exhausted with his
Jong battle with the waves, Anderson
had a hard fight to reach the shore," but
he finally accomplished It with the-as

A junk which lay off Port Arthur
June 4. on account of lack of wind,
heard desult. ry firing on the morning
of the 4th and saw five Japanese tor
pedo destroyers as they disappeared
below the horizon. Afterward a
tremendous explosion was heard and
it was thought by those on the junk
that possibly one of the destroyers
had struck a mine.
On the night of June 3. immense cnl
ums of flame and smoke were Been
from the junk In the direction of
Dalny.
A Japanese correspondent from
Dalny confirms the reported advance
of the Japanese army on Port Arthur,
news of which was brought here to-day
by the Chinese. The correspondent
states, however, that there are fifteen
miles between the Japanese and Port
Arthur instead of seven as reported, by
the Chinese. The Japanese army is
advancing along roth coasts. It is re
ported that the peninsula division on
the east coast fought a b: ale within
fifteen miles of Port Arthur June 3.
TJie result of the battle has not yet
beon lea-ned.
The Chinese further reported that a
number of Chinese have been shot
while attempting to get through the
Russian lines.
CHEFU, June 6, 10:30 a. m.â But two
'miles separated the Japanese and Rus
sian armies on Liaotung peninsula on
June 2, according to Chinese who have
arrived here from Dalny.
The Japanese army, reinforced by the
men that landed at Dalny, occupied
Twingching and Senchimpo, southwest
of Dalny. It then proceeded along the
east coast toward Port Arthur. On one
side of the army are high mountains
and on the other side is the sea, from,
which the Japanese gunboats are sup
porting the flank of the army.
On June 2 the Japanese forces were
>-ithin seven miles oÂ£ the outer forts
of Port Arthur and only two miles
from the Russian army, which is ready
to protest their further advance. The
Chinese believed that there would be
a big battle at this point.
It is also stated by the Chinese that
the Japanese have moved their base to
Dalny. from Talienwan. The larger
Japanese ships are anchored outside
and the smaller ones inside the harbor.
Troops are being landed, they say, from
small vessels, apparently coming from
Pltzwo or the Elliott islands.

that a large Japanese vessel has been
sunk by a mine off Talicnwan. The
news has not been confirmed.
No other -man knew so much of the
manner of Young's life as did his
brother-in-law, William Luse. Young
told Luse he had at last come to real
ize that he had made a. great mistake
in becoming entangled with the ac
tress. It was upon the advice of Luse
that Young consented to take a long
trip through Europe. Luse advised
Young to make the woman understand
he was in earnest in his intention to
leave her.
Late Friday afternoon Young learned
that "Nan" Patterson had spent the ai
ternoon at Gravesend, attempting to
see him there. A telephone message
was received from the woman. She
told Young she must see him. and it
is said on good authority that she then
said. that if Young did not come to her
she would take her life. Young told Luse
of .this threat, and, though neither man
beiievedÂ» the woman would put it into
execution, it was decided that Yourfg
should see her, Luse being near by to
prevent any sensational demonstration.
Thereupon it was agreed that "Nan"
Patterson should meet Young and Luse
in a restaurant at One Hundred and
Sixteenth stree^ and Eighth. avenue at
10 o'clock Friday night.
. Young and Luse rode down to the
restaurant. "Nan" was there by ap
pointment. * She expressed regret that
their last interview was not a private
one. Luse said that he was there at
the ' request of his brother-in-law and
had no intention of interfering.
TURFMAN'S I/AST- TRYST.
"Caesar" Young made little attempt
to conceal his love for "Nan" Patter
son, yet he was determined to break off
his alliance with the woman. It was
after she learned that Young had de
cided to give her up that she wrote
several letters which may have a bear
ing in the present case. These letters
are not of-a threatening nature, though
in them "Nan" Patterson announced
that she could not permit Young to
leave her. *":'Â¦:"
Six detectives were working to-day to
discover the ownership of the revolver
and also to learn from whom it was
purchased. .Trends of Young assert
that he never had a revolver of any
sort. One witness has been discovered
who tells a story of having seen such
a weapon as was used in the possession
of J. Morgan Smith. The latter's wife
and "Nan" Patterson are sisters.
Assistant District Attorney Garvan
says that if Young committed suicide
he made up his mind to do so less than
three minutes before he was shot.
Members of the Young. family would
like to have the examination of "Nan"
Patterson postponed for at least
twenty-four hours, but the defense will
demand that there be no delay and
Garvan is inclined to go on with it to
morrow. Young's body was given- over
to his stricken wife this morning.' She
1s now in New Rochelle, at the home of
her sister. A physician is near at hand
all the time. :?;>;.
Assistant District Attorney GarvaTi
has -traced the movements of Young
and "Nan" Patterson from thei-.Tneet
insr previous to the tragedy :vud up to
the moment of the shootirj^. lie knows
where the two spent several hours on
Friday night and that threats were
then made against Young.
A mysterious witness has been dis
covered who Is expected to give im
portant evidence.
A careful study of the nature of the
wound in Young's body would seem to'
indicate that it would have been nearly
impossible for him to shoot himself.
Dr. Ledorie, who is making a chemical
and microscopic examination of flesh
taken from the ends of the fingers of
Young's right hand, has not yet com
pleted his work, but he has proceeded
far enough to warrant him in assuring
the District Attorney that it is un
likely that powder marks will be found.

make a full change of clothing and it
is feared possible evidence may have
been destroyed. The suggestion was
made that powder marks on her cloth

people of his church, at a conference of

Speaking of his own polygamous state,
he said:
"I dare not and will not cast aside

ty. I dare not and will not cast aside
the mothers of my children. If I did
I should be forever damned and be for

"I .would not 'Shrink from exile. Im

duty to God and man. When it comes,
however, to throwing aside all hope of
future happiness, all expectation of
continued union with , those I love. I
will not make such a sacrifice. I dare
not and cannot; but, rather, I will be
true to my duty, true to my trust,
true to my God, my wives, my children.
*'I want to impress upon you the sa
credness and hallowedness of the mar
riage relation. I would as soon think
of ridiculing the attributes and holiness
of God as to make light or Joking allu

NEW YORK, June 6â On the verge of
collapse yesterday, "Nan" Patterson
arose cheerful this morning. The wo
men in her tier of cells are given the
liberty of the rectangular corridor and
after breakfast they began exercising
in this space, walking back and forth.
Mrs. Patterson's dress waa in broad
contrast to the gowns of the other
prisoners, but she displayed none of
the mannerisms of the show girl. She
Â¦was affable and tried to be cheerful.
She spoke to the other prisoners and*
three young women attracted her at
tention and she joined them. She
talked with them .at length, learning
their names and why they were prison
ers and then the four exercised to
gether. As the keeper expressed it, she
"grew quite chummy". with the young
women.

ST. PETERSBURG. June 5. â W. S.
Smith, a brother of Samuel Smith,
United States Consul at Moscow, has
arrived here from Port Arthur. Smith
expresses confidence that Port Arthur
will never be taken, unless the Japa

he: Â» -:.
"The Russians had 38,000 men at
Port Arthur at the time I left there
and every man is hale and hearty arid'
is prepared to fight to the death to
prevent the capture of the fortress.
All the surrounding heights are
strongly fortified by entrenchments,

Young Corbett is an ardent admirer
of "Nan." His manager. Pollock, of
fered bail for her on Saturday, which
was refused.
Young said if she -would be good he
would call for her in the morning and
would let her ride down town with
him.
Young's partner. John Millin. says
"Nan's" brother-in-law had a pistol
like that found In the cab.
"Yes. I do," said the woman"; and
I'll be at the pier to make things lively
for you."
"Caesar, you cannot leave me. Even
if you go to Europe you cannot forget,
so \v,hat is the use? I shall not let
you go."
Young told her that she was foolish
and said Ehe must realize that what he
was about to do was the best thing
for both. He said she could not de
ter him from the trip. She cried quiet
ly and then became almost hysterical
and Young grew impatient.
"Nothing will stop me from going."
he said. "You have known for a long
time that I intended breaking it off.
I have loved you and do love you now,
but I will travel until I forget you. I
will stay abroad a year, if necessary."
"You shall not go," was the woman's
response.
"I shallâ I. will to-morrow," was
Young's reply.
"Then I'll be at the pier and there
will be trouble."
That appeared to make Young ex
ceedingly angry. At first he told the
woman she was making a fool of her
self. Then he seemed to think it all
a joke and tried to laugh her out of her
folly.
"You do not know what ship I sail
on," he said.
"You are not children," said Luse,
and I guess you don't mind me."
The woman then withdrew her objec
tion and. said the was happy to have
Young with her, even If they could not
be alone. A bottle of champagne was
ordered, and some light food.
Other bottles followed, and until 1
o'clock Saturday morning they sat
talking. The woman seemed fairly sat
isfied, talked freely and appeared to
realize that all was over between her
self and Young. But after they had
had a few drinks she said:

DISCREDITS THE SUICIDE THEORY
"It was vhile working in the mines
at V'rgtnla City that I first met Mac
kay" said Bagley. "He was then a
poor miner like myself and earned a
living by picking over rocks for gold
on the mountains. All tbe money he
earned he h-p*nt in purchasing shares
In mines nf the vicinity from 20 to
Â£0 cents each. I c-fteh bought him
a iiiial and Â« ne day he came to me
and taid: 'John. I've got to lose my
interest in the mines as an assessment
is levied on my shares and I can't pay
up. I'm broke.' Having plenty of
money at the time I lent him %~ 50 that
he needed and the very mines that I
saved hi? interfst in made him a rich
man. I didn't ihink at ihe time that
Mackay would be a millionaire and
that I would die in a poor house."
Bagley is willing to make affidavit to
this story.
H.OLYOKE. Mass. June 5.â John
liagley, w bo asserts that he gave the

fpeci&l Dispatch to Th* Call
The Standard's Tientain correspond
ent reports that the Russian forces
are being withdrawn gradually north
ward, the Russians being aware that
a strong force of Japanese is gather
ing in the passes northeast of Mukden.
The Shanghai correspondent also
says that Field Marshal Tamagata has
been appointed Viceroy of the terri
tory Japan has occupied since the war
began. This is the only reference this
morning to the statement of the Daily
Express on Saturday morning- that
Field Marshal Yamagata had been ap
pointed commander-in-chlef of the
Japanese army of invasion.
A dispatch to the Standard from St.
Petersburg asserts that no prepara
tions whatever are being or have been
made to organize a' transport service
down the great waterways. of the Sun
gari and Amur rivers. Great indigna
,tion Ir felt over the discovery that
several wealthy Russian firms "secret
ly assisted in the 1 recent Japanese
loan." â¢
A dispatch to the Morning Post
from Shanghai says that some of the
warEhpis at Port Arthur have been
beached and their guns removed to
the landworks.
"Internal troubles are lnevitlable,"
the correspondent says, "should the
fortress fall. Count Lamsdorff dis
plays a strong personality, but his
position is precarious and he is likely
to be" sacrificed as a scapegoat to
popular indignation at the way the
war has been conducted. Although
it is said that General Kuropatkin has
lost favor at court, no change in the
commanderBhip of the army is con
templated." â¢
The St. Petersburg correspondent of
Reuter's Telegram Agency says that
Increasing anxiety is felt over the rest
lessness of Chinese troops on the Man
churlan frontier.
The Morning Post's correspondent
in St. Petersburg goes so far as to. say
that Russia is preparing to cope with
a serious Chinese invasion.
Various special correspondents '.in
St Petersburg report Increasing de
pression in Russia over the prospect
of the fall of Port Arthur and say
that wild reports are in circulation as
to dissensions between the generals
and the highest officials over questions
of policy and strategy. The Daily Mall
gives great prominence. to a statement
'â¢from a Russian correspondent,'.' de
claring that Russia will stand or fall
with Port Arthur, as far as the Gov
ernment's prestige with the lower
classes is concerned.
LONDON, June 6, â The curtain Ib
drawn again In view of the progress
of the war, probably Indicating that
important events are impending or
afoot. The explosions heard at Port
Arthur suggests that the Russians
have renewed their attempts to re
move obstructions in the mouth of the
harbor. All kinds of rumors are cur
rent, few of Which appear to have" any
reliable basis. . â¢ .. *'Â¦( : ' â¢.'."*'.â¢â¢'
TOKIO, June 5. â The Japanese and
Russian forces located north of Pulan
tien, which were in a series of brushes
during the early part of last week, (
had another encounter on Friday, June
3. near Chuohiatun. On that day the
Japanese cavalry met the Russians at
noon. The Russians numbered 2000
men and were composed of infantry,
detachments of cavalry and artillery.
They were pressing the Japanese cav
alry, when the Japanese assembled
their entire force and engaged tha
enemy. The Russians drew off grad
ually, and at half past five in the after
noon they retired to Telissu. The Jap
anese had four men killed and four
men wounded in this fighting.
A report has been received here from
General Kuroki, saying that on Friday
last a detachment was dispatched from
Aiyangcheng (northeast of Fengwang
cheng) to make a roconnoissance toward
Sulmatsza (35 miles north of Feng
wangcheng). This detachment encount
ered 600 Copsacks, and after a brisk en
gagement the Russians retreated. Gen
eral Kuroki reports that the Russian
loss was heavy. The Japanese had one
man killed and three wounded.

The Rev. Father Bontempo an
nounced that next Sunday there will be
a special mission service at (fce church.
The Rev. Father Bontempo in his
sermon spoke of the building as the
first Slavonian church to be erected in
California and expressed nis belief that
the congregation felt the deepest grati
tude to Archbishop Riordan and Arch
bishop Montgomery for the part each
had taken in the furtherance of the
completion of the church. To Bishop
Stariha he also gave thanks.
Archbishop Montgomery tendered
the congregation his felicitations and
said that it had been the wish of Arch
bishop Riordan to be present, but his
absence in the East precluded his being
among them. It had been Archbishop
Riordan's great hope to see the Slavo
nians of the city have their own church,
and he had received from the Arch
bishop a communication desiring that
his special blessing should be given the
congregation and the church. Arch
bishop Montgomery paid a high tribute
to Father Francis Turk, the rector of
the church.
At 9:30 in the morning a procession
was formed at St. Ignatius Church and
tho distinguished prelates were escort
ed to the new church by a guard of
honor composed of members of the
Slavonian Catholic society of St.
Joseph, No. 23.
Arriving at the church. Bishop
Stariha blessed the edifice as he made
a circuit of the building. In his train
were several fathers, and preceding
the procession were the acolytes.
The bishop's sermon was delivered in
Slavonian and he took occasion to ex
press his hearty thankfulness for the
beautiful edifice.
The Church of the Nativity, Fell
street, near Gough. erected by Slavon
ian citizens, was" dedicated yesterday
by the Right Rev. Bishop John N.
Stariha of South Dakota. Archbishop
Montgomery and numerous clergymen
assisted, and the handsome new edi
fice was crowded.
~ While engaged In a game of whist
Renfro remarked to his companions
that if God would demonstrate himself

would believe In him. Hardly had the
words escaped Renfro's lips when he

Since being stricken he has professed
his belief in Christ and has gone to
his home in Shreveport, La., where,
under a Christian mother's care, he
will study the. scriptures with the hope
that ultimately he will be able to
preach the gospel from pulpit and plat

feature of the pony show held in this
city yesterday afternoon, under the
auspices of the San Rafael Improve
ment Club, was "Chisi," owned by
Thomas H. Williams of San Francisco.

Hermann Oelrichs for the smallest
pony on exhibition.
"Chisi" had no difficulty whatever in
carrying off the honors. There were a
large number of small ponies on exhi
bition, but "Chisi" was several inches
smaller than any other. He measures
32 Inches in height and is fully grown.
Yesterday afternoon the diminutive
animal was both ridden and driven.
Little Baby Dean, the three-year-old
son of Walter Dean, sat in the saddle
and afterward handled the reins.

shoe can be made out of a piece of
metal the size of a silver dollar. He is

No trains have born able to enter
or leave Deadw<Â«od sinoe Friday on ac
count of washouts. The damage was
jrreatest nt Ventral City, nearly all of
the business portion of that town be
ins washed away. A large number of
homes at Gayville. a few miles dis
tant, were tarried away and the lower
jiart of the town is under water.
It is estimated that the property loss
in Dead wood and other places will ex
< <-c> half a million dollars. The water
is Frill high, but it is believed the crest
of the flood has been reached.
DEAD WOOD, S. D., June 5.â As a
result of a heavy rainfall throughout
the Black Hills, which has continued
for nearly a week, Whitewood, Dead
wood and City creeks, passing within
the city limits, have left their banks,
tarrying away a number of houses,
barns, sidewalks and lumber yards. The
Waite building, one of the most sub
stantial in the city, was partially,
wrecked and the City Hall badly dam
aped. One large bridge was carried
away. Two lives are known to have
been lost. Matthew Bender, a young
mail of Central City, was drowned in
pn attempt to save property, and Guy
shoudy, a farmer, perished near Stur-
Sis.
There were, no papers or marks of
identification other than the figure of
a butterfly tattooed on the chest of the
dead man and a five-pointed star on
the right wrist. On the back of the
head, on the right cheek and over
the eye were wounds apparently made
with gome sharp instrument. There
were faint bloodstains on the floor of
the building.
Some newspapers were found, two
being San Francisco papers and one a
Kansas City publication of recent date.
The indications are. according to
the police, that the murder was com
mitted in some other place and the
body brought to the old plant and
thrown into the water through a hole
in the floor. Officers are working on
the case, but there is as yet no clew
to the murderer.
BAKERSFIELD, June 5. â The find
ing of the body of an unknown man,
apparently about 35 years of age. In
the water under an abandoned power
plaÂ«* on the canal near the city limits
to-day, reveals what has undoubtedly
been a most foul murder.. The spot is
isolated and the â¢'corpse might have
remained there for months undiscov
ered but for an accident. It is cer
tain that the man had been dead sev
eral days. The plant is an old frame
building, formerly used in furnishing
water power for an abandoned brick
plant. Under it there is a large
amount of stagnant water, where the
body was discovered this morning by
James Campbell, a laborer, who had
been swimming in the canal a short
distance above.

gate speak for Mr. Roosevelt in the
convention has been under serious con
sideration at the various political con
ferences recently held at the White
House. Senator McCc-mas is authority
for the statement that Cummings, a
clever negro lawyer residing in the
west end of Baltimore, was agreed
upon several days ago. . .
At the White House there is no dis
position to deny the story. Thc-se who
have the President's confidence have
known for some time that one of the
seconding speeches in the convention
would be made by a negro delegate.
There has been lively competition
among negro orators for the honor and
j it is understood Senator McComas was
! successful in urging the claim of Cum
j mings, on the ground that It might re-
I suit in the 'Republicans recapturing
Maryland from the Democrats next
fall.

of a family row, J. E. Brown of 160S
East Eighteenth street secured war
rants yesterday from Justice of the
Peace Geary of East Oakland for the
arrest of his son, Harry A. Brown, and
the latter's wife. The complainant
charges the son with battery and his
wife with disturbing the peace. Ac
cording to the complaint all the par
ties have been living in the same
house*, and the Irouble was the result
of a dispute over business matters.
M. J. Moreira, residing near Hay
wards, applied at the District Attor
ney's office yesterday for a warrant for
the arrest of his brother, R. J. Mo
reira, whom he charges with assault
with a deadly weapon. He alleges
that his brother attacked him with a
club during a quarrel over money
matters, and struck him on the head.
Moreira's face was badly bruised as a
result of the encounter, but as his
brother had already been fined by
Justice Prowse for battery, the appli
cation for the second warrant was
denied.

to table than the hostess and her five brides
maids.
In the renter of the round table waÂ» a
basket filled with pastel pink sweet r*as and
on the handle was a fluffy tulle rosette, fash

place and were later worn by the guests. The
favors were tiny cut glass vases, each holding
a single long-stemmed Bridesmaid rose. An
other pretty decorative feature was. thÂ« six
small baskets lined with r<rnnlum leaves and
filled with luscious strawberries. On the han

veil. The guests carried their bankets home
as souvenirs of a very memorable and delight

Lewis was about 65 years of age. His
nativity and civil status were not
learned. Coroner Mehrmann has the
case in hand.
Penniless, homeless and worn out by
the struggle for existence. Dr. J. W.
L/ewis, an aged physician ended his
own life last night by cutting his
throat with a penknife in a room at
414 Seventh street, where the old man
had been given temporary shelter. The
body was found tnis morning by
George Pointer, a painter and pro
prietor of the place.
Pointer saw the body through a win
dow and he called the police, who broke
into the room. Nothing was left be
hind to tell the story exrept a pawn
ticket and a few odds and ends. On
a bloodstained piece of newspaper were
written some illegible words in lead
pencil. They seemed to be some sort of
last instruction*, but Deputy Coroner
Quellan could not decipher them.
Lewis tried to commit euieide a short
time ago while he was lodging at 903^4
Washington Ftreet. from which place
he was ordered out a few days ago.
The old man went to Pointer's
and installed an employment agency
there, but no patrons went to him.
Papers in his possession showed that
Lewis had practiced his profession at
Sacramento ten years ago, having of
fices at 804^ K street. Cards indicated
that Lewis also tried to carry on a
medical buFlness in Oakland.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, June 5.
For many years "Frenchy" had a
hack stand in front of the old Athen
ian Club and later at the Macdonough
Theater. Among his patrons were
many of the Athenians, who reposed
great confidence in the pioneer cabby.
"Frenchy" deserted his hack busi
ness during the early part of the Klon
dike boom. Gathering up the few thou
sand dollars he had saved Toussaint
went off to Alaska to win a fortune,
but the fickle lady gave the Oaklander
the mitten. Toussaint lost every dol
lar he had and returned to Oakland
and his hack stand, broken in health,
despondent and without a penny. Mat
ters ran from bad to worse and the
home was mortgaged. Then the se
rTous illness overtook him and to the
County Infirmary "Frenchy" was com
pelled to go.
A companion in misery at the infirm
ary is "Majah" Waters, tall, lean and
angular, a negro chimney sweep,
known the length and breadth of the
city. Waters is in a bad way from
lung trouble.
A pitiable story of hard earnings
Io6t, of poverty, of sickness and desti
tution, is the situation that confronts
Toussaint and his faithful wife.
Dying at the County Infirmary, with
his wife destitute and their little home
mortgaged, is Nicholas Toussaint, bet
ter known to the club men and the
"night owls" as "Frenchy," the hack
man. A fatal malady is upon the old
time hack driver and it is only a ques
tion of a few days, if not hours, when
"Frenchy" shall be no more.

PRESS EFFORT
ON AFFIDAVITS
The authors find that it Is greatly
improbable that the tar found in the
egg is of external origin. All the re
sults point to its having been derived
from' the material present in the egg.
Though absolute proof cannot be given
the evidence amounts to almost a dem
onstration that the bituminous' sub
stance now present in the egg repre
sents a part of its original organic con
tents. In the absence of any evidence
to the contrary the origin to which this
evidence points is accepted. This spec
imen presents, the authors conclude,
possibly the only one instance in which
conclusive evidence is at hand to con
nect . the bituminous matter with the
original material from which it has
been derived by a natural process with
out abnormal conditions.
With the exceotlon of a mnall space near
the periphery the interior U filled solidly with
a beautifully crystalline mass of the mineral
colemanlte. In several places next the shell
there If pnÂ»eent a dark brown semi-fluid tarry
mattrlal resembling Mphalt. When cold It In
brittle, but as the temperature rise* It stows
Â¦otter until at 100 deereea Centigrade It be
comes a fluid. It* Boecinc gravity Is a trifle
lesii than that of bolllne water.
These facts tell us something of the history
of the e&g fossil during the period. In which It
lay burled, and also show the relation' of thÂ«
tar It contain* to other bituminous matter.
Since the tar Is completely soluble In petro
leum ether without residue of any kind, while
the heated product Is larjcely Insoluble In the
same menstruum, it Is evident that the fosell
has never been subjected to a temperature as
high as 150 degrees Centigrade. The tar as it
exists in the egg requires simply this slight
elevatlcn of temperature to make it lndlMln
gunhable from a natural asphalt.
The minutest markings of the shell
are preserved in the matrix. Upon re
moving the capsule it was found that
its inner surface was marked with pe
culiar pits and to be covered with a
thin layer of tarry material, which
usually fills the pits completely. The
number of pits in any piece of the mat
rix corresponds with the number of vis
ible pores in that part of the shell from
which it was removed. Of the contents
of the egg the authors of the bulletin
say:
MARKINGS ARE PRESERVED.
This egg was found by a prospector
seeking for gold on the banks of the
Gila River in Arizona. The prospector
turned it over to G. A. Hel
more, a mining man of San
Francisco, and Mr. Helmore has loaned
It to the university for study
and description. Other prehis
toric eggs have been found, but none
so valuable as this. Those found in
New Zealand are of birds that laid eggs
of unusual thickness and strength. The
eggs of the tertiary period from Au
vergne, France, are mere shells filled
with hardened mud.
When found the Tallmon egg was
enclosed in a matrix of solid rock, in
removing which the specimen was
broken. The shell has retained its
original composition and microscopic
nature. The chemical analysis shows
that it does not differ from the shell of
a wild goose egg, and a thin section de
velops that it is of the same structure
as that exhibited by a similar section
from a hen's egg. It is the opinion of
the investigators that the specimen be
longed to an aquatic bird, probably one
of the cormorant type.
the other, but this offspring of the fowl
family may be said to be between 1,000,
000 and 2,000,000 years of age.
The conjectures over the years of
the egg are contained in a bulletin
Just issued at the university by Pro
fessor William Conger Morgan and
Miss Marion Clover Tallmon, his as
sistant. There are some interesting
data in the bulletin, and they concern
tht antiquity of the egg. Their value
is also important as a determining fac
tor in proving the origin of bituminous
substances, which this inquiry proves
to be organic.

BERKELEY. June 6.â Whether the
prehistoric egg found in Arizona and
now in the possession of the University
of California is 1,000,000 or 2,000,000
years old is a question that has puzzled
the scientists at the university for a

1,000,000 years of age it does not matter
much to anybody but the scientists.
The scientists at the university' are
unable to determine whether the' egg
was laid in the quarternary period of
the earth's formation or later. Now the
quarternary period is anywhere from
1,000,000 to 2,500,000 years old, some sci

Footpads were busy along the water
front early yesterday morning. Shortly
after midnight Alfred Ryal. a wood
chopper living at the Finland House
on Steuart street, near Folsom. was
held up by two men on Steuart street,
near Mission. One of them had a re
volver. They took $40 in gold from
him. '
About half an hour later Policeman
T. F. Conlon, who was In plain clothes,
saw two men standing under the coal
bunkers on East street. As he ap
proached them one walked to the edge
of the sidewalk so that he would have
to pass between them. Both put their
hands in their hip pockets and Conlon
pulled his revolver gut of his pocket
and ordered them to throw up their
hands and walk ahead, as he was an
officer. They walked about twenty
feet, when Alfred McLaughlin, one of
the two, with an oath said he would
not hold up his hands for any police
man and attempted to draw a revol
ver. Conlon struck him on the head
with the butt end of his revolver,
knocking him down, and the other man
ran through a saloon at 118 East street
and escaped.
McLaughlin was taken to the Harbor
Hospital and after his scalp was dress
ed he was sent to the Harbor statloA
While there Ryal had a look at him.
but would not swear positively he was
one of the footpads, as the suspect's
head was swathed in bandages. An
hour later a messenger boy called at
the station, asking what charge had
been placed against McLaughlin. and
after he left he was followed by Ser
geant Ellis and Conlon to Pine and
Kearny streets, where he spoke to two
men. one of whom Conlon recognized
as McLaughlin's companion. They
were placed under arrest and taken to
the City Prison and locked up in the
tanks, whergr McLaughlin had preced
ed them. Their names are James Lang
and Thomas Byrne.
Abbut 5 o'clock yesterday morninff
Warner Granloaf, a carpenter living
at 36 Steuart street, was held up by
three men on Pacific street near San
some and robbed of fifteen cents, two
keys and a key chain. A few minutes
later Sergeant Ellis arrested John J.
Mangan, Louis Wilkins and Michael
Brarinan on East street, between Clay
and Washington, and took them to the
Harbor station. Granloaf was there
and he saw Wilkina slip something un
der a newspaper on the bench where
he was seated. Serseant Ellis was no
tified and under the newspaper he
found the keys and key chain taken
from Granloaf. The three prisoners
were booked on a charge of robbery.

Postal Clerks' Outing.
Ladies, what think you of the clever
ness of the club^that embodied the fol
lowing clause in its constitution: â¢
"Resolved, That the three D"s be res
olutely eliminated from club discus
sion, public or private â dress, disease
and domestics. Oh, what a joy those
club meetings must have been, when no
defenseless member was sentenced to
listen to a recital of some one's woes.
Why wouldn't that resolution be a
good thing in California?
The ladies of the Association of Pio
neer Women of California held their

ily. About fifty of the members of the

the â¢ rare privilege, spending the day
under the shade of the stately red
woods and laurels of this favored place.
The time was pleasantly passed in
various ways. Old friends met to tell
old tales; old songs were sung and old
verses recited. It was a day to be long
remembered, not only by the pioneer
ladies, but by those of the second and
third generations, which were well rep
resented. The regular monthly meet
ing of this association was held on Fri
day at 2 p. m. in Golden Gate Hall. In
the absence of the president, Mrs. Anna
E. Mclntyre, who is traveling in the
East, Mrs. A. B. Macdonald presided
in a charming manner.

The Mission Dolores committee suc
ceeded in securing an appropriation of
$5000 to be expended in parking and

The last meeting of the year of the
California Club was held on Tuesday,
when the newly elected officers were
installed. Miss Kate Atkinson per
formed the service in charming fash
ion, when pretty flowers, pretty

might truthfully add. pretty women,
were it not that the ladies are all so
dreadfully modest â gave evidence of
the interest centering around the last
club day of the year.
The Adelphian Club of Alameda, Mrs.

bers.
On Saturday the club held the last
session of the year, when a musical
programme of exceptional merit was
presented by Miss Klena Roeckel. Mrs.
Paul Frledhofer and Dr. Humphreys.
Miss Fernanda Pratt, who accompanied
Mrs. Friedhofer, attracted much com
ment for her sympathetic playing â a
rare trait jn so young a^girl.
Miss Moore of the Home Club of Oak
land made an earnest appeal to the
ladies for support of the movement to
secure a sanitary dairy somewhere on
that side of the bay, that pure milk
might be obtained by all that desired It.
A little talk upon the missions of
California, and San Antonio Mission In
particular, closed the programme.
A charming .president is Mrs. Chap
man, possessing an abundance of tact
â that elemental factor of "success in a
presiding officer.

The St. Louis Exposition is exhibit
ing a marked effect upon society and
its jtlans. Though the devotees of
pleasure are seeking the'solitude of the
mountains or the passive pleasures of
the seaside, they are timing the visits
with regard to a general exodus to the
fair in the fall.
The heat of St. Louis in midsummer
is said to be incompatible with comfort,
hence the de-termination to defer the
visits until the mellow days of soft
September.

For fifty miles about, over mountains
and valleys, come horsemen, gayly ca
parisoned, and vehicles of every type
bearing types of people not to be found
in many parts of our country to-day.
They are passing fast, these people
of the mission days, and the pictur
esque costumes are passing with them.
On the 19th the graves of the won
derful men who founded this mission
in the wilderness in 1771 will be opened
by the friars of the Franciscan order,
and the bodies identified. There are
supposed to be five padres interred
there, if ghouls # have not disturbed the
sepulchres in search of goldâ a suppo
sition that obtained much credence in
the 'BQ's and '60's.
Work will be resumed on the mission
just as soon as funds are available,
when the shake roof will be completed
and the century-old tiles laid over it â
this to secure the durability of the roof.
Other than this.' the restoration is pro
gressing exactly on the lines of its
founders.
The board of directors of the league
will meet on Wednesday at Native v
Sons' Hall (secretary's office) at 8:15"
o'clock p. m.
â¢ Â¦ - _â¢_
At no time in the history of men has
there been a greater need for a con
templative pause in the mad rush for
a living. Goaded on by the necessities
or the ambitions of life, men have al
most forgotten the process of reflec
tionâthe emery wheel of character.
Herein lies the urgency of object les
sons lhat they may awaken men to the
higher obligations of life. And the im
portance of maintaining ideals in the
lives and deeds of men who have left
us legacies of noble characters grows
daily more imperative. With this as
an underlying incentive the California
Landmarks League has set itself the
task of perpetuating the famous old
missions of the northern part of the
State â perpetuating, them not only in
song and story, but in reality.
In September last the league under
took the restoration oC Mission San An
tonio de Padua in Monterey County,
over the mountains from Mission San
Miguel. This old sanctuary is without
question the most picturesque spot in
all California, from the viewpoints of
situation^of romance, of history, of
architecture and of atmosphere.
Situated in the oak-studded valley of
the San Antonio, at the foot of the pur
ple Santa Lucia, it is even in its ruins
a proud structure. When the league
undertook its work the roof had fallen
into the chapel, the rains had washed
away fully a quarter of the east and
west walls, thus left unprotected, and
tons of debris filled the sanctuary, cov
ering the graves of its founders.
When in November the winter rains
compelled the cessation of labor, all
the debris had been removed, 7000
adobes (each weighing fifty pounds),
had been laid in the broken walls,
bringing them up to their wonted
height, and thirty feet of the shake
roof laid. The walls were then care
fully protected from the elements, all
the ancient tiles and adobes gathered
together from off the acres of mission
land and the lumber stored away in
the chapel to await a resumption of
work in the summer or fall.
In carrying on this labor the Land
marks League succeeded in obtaining
lumber at almost one-half of the mar
ket rate at a small mill in the moun
tains, twenty miles to the west. Six
weeks' labor was generously con
tributed by the people who live about
the\ mission, many of- whom are de
scendants of the early children of the
mission. In this manner the Land
marks League succeeded in accom
plishing about twice the amount of
work for the sum of money expended,
amounting up to date to $1365 65.
Of this the laborers received $1 a
day and were fed at a provision camp
established and maintained by the
league at a minimum cost. The su
perintendent, J. Alonzo Forbes, a life
long resident of the Jolon Valley, a
practical builder and a student of the
mission affairs, received $2 a day, a
small sum for the services rendered,
which were offered in the spirit of pa
triotism, that the work be not ham
pered by the scarcity of funds.
â¢ On the 19th of this month Senator
Joseph R. Knowland, president of the
Landmarks League, Father Theodore
Ahrens, provincial of the Franciscans
on the Pacific Coast, Father Zephryn,
the famous historian, and many league
members and friends are going down
to the celebration in the old sanctuary
of San Antonio's day â a scene that
perhaps cannot be duplicated to-day
outside of Mexico.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 6, 1904,
This is the drama in which Mrs. Car
ter has been appearing in all the large
cities of the Kast for the last three the
atrical seasons, with a success that has
even surpassed all of her own previous
triumphs. Amusement lovers of San
Francisco will see Mrs. Carter's play in
its entirety. The actress and the 122
members of her company left New
York for their transcontinental Journey
in a special^train of {en cars.. Four of
the coaches "were occupied by the com
pany, and in the remaining half dozen
cars were stored the equipment of
scenery, furniture of the Louis XV
period, the bric-a-brac, costumes, prop
erties, lighting effects and the like.
This stage paraphernalia is said to'
represent the complete production as
Mrs. Carter gave it in New York. San
Francisco theater patrons will witness
a performance of "Du Barry," therefore,
that will be considerably more imposing
than anything the native stage has
heretofore known. The advance sale
of seats for the engagement will begin
at the box office of the Grand on next
Thursday morning. - Meantime, mall
orders will be received and when ac
companied by remittances will be filled
in the order in which they reach the
treasurer of the theater. , .
Judging from the -large number of
mail orders received I by Treasurer
Campbell of the Grand Opera House,
Mrs. Leslie Carter will b.e greeted by a
series of audiences that will tax even
the seating capacity of that playhouse.
Mrs. Carter will present for the first
time in this city, Monday night, June
13, David Belasco's play "Du Barry."

Seven million dollars â¢ has already
been spent in the construction of the
tunnel and the establishment of the
freight railway system in Chicago. It
has been an easy matter to obtain all
the cash required for the construction
work and for the successful flotation
by the Illinois Tunnel Company of a
$60,000,000 corporation, half in stock
and half in bonds. At present three
electric locomotives and twenty-four
freight cars are running. The Illinois
Tunnel Company, the owner of the
project, has let the contract for 3000
steel cars and 100 electric lo
comotives. The cars will be em-,
ployed in hauling every kind of
freight, including coal and gen
eral merchandise. The electric lo
comotive* have a capacity of fifty tons
each on the level and 100 tons on the
Inclines, which are to be used in con
necting the railroad yards and build
ings with the tunnels. The cars will
each hold twenty-five barrels of sugar,
flour or general merchandise, or seven
tons of coal.
One of the most valued services of
the underground freight railway -will
be in relieving the cramped condition
of the Chicago railway terminals.
Forty per cent of the total railway
mileage of the United States has ter
minals in downtown Chicago. Thirty
eight railroads and railroad systems
have terminals here and these thirty
eight are compelled to receive and de
liver freight. from a mere half-dozen
freight depots. More than $50,000,000
annually Is now spent . in trucking
freight across Chicago from freight
terminals to warehouses and stores. â

Travel in Uganda.
Special Correspondence.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL.,
HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. May 24. â The
picture of Uganda as a new field for
the blase tourist, drawn by the secre
tary of the West Africa Protectorate
on his arrival here the other day, was
enticing enough. It eeems that thts
picturesque region now can be reached
easily from the coast by means of the
new railway which has been building
for so long, a beggarly 5125 paying for
the Journey of S00 miles that ten years
Â¦ go would have cost more than twenty
times that much. But in his descrip
tion of the manifold attractions of this
route the official wisely omitted to
mention certain exciting accompani
ments of railway traveling in Uganda
of which it may, however, be well to
say a word.
The railway passes through a region
teeming with wild beasts â a colossal
natural zoo without bars or cages.
Among the animals elephants are still
numerous and they don't take kindly
to the invasion of their primeval Jun
gles by steam monsters and steel
track?. Occasionally a troop of them
makes a decent on a wayside station.
When the shrill trumpetings which her
ald their approach are heard the sta
tion agent Intakes himself to the near
est tree and the attendants and any
stop-over tourists who may chance to
be around follow his example. On more
than one occasion, it is said, a tele
graph operator, when hard pressed, has
been known to take refuge in the wa
ter tank. With the field to themselves
the elephants clean out the station
much more effectually than a gang of
Western bandits would do it, eating all
refreshments. Fmashing furniture,
making matchwood of the ticket office
and scattering the bit? of pasteboard
to the lour winds of heaven. Jumbo
is decidedly a persona non grata with
the railroad officials, as the only way
to collect damages against hjm is to
take it out of his hide and levy on his
ivory
The natives, though not especially
Â¦uell disposed, have not yet tried to
hold up a train. They leave that game
to the leather armor-plated rhinocer
os and the thick hided hippopotamus,
which sometimes wano>r on the track
and refuse to budge when the locomo
tive comes in sight. That sort of en
counter generally ends in the intruder
getting shot and a long halt follows
while the perspiring train hands shift
the carcass off the track and the pas
sengers enjoy the feeling that they are
getting a deal more than their money's
worth. It is a Joyful time for the ama
teur photographer, who thus obtains
indisputable evidence of his courage
and prowess to be displayed to an ad
miring circle of friends when he re
turns home.
Uganda Is a favorite stamping
CTound of lions, many of which' have
grown quite accustomed to the whistle
of the locomotive and the roar of the
trains and no longer flee from them.
More than <ne snap shot has been
obtained from a carriage window of
a lion devouring a zebra or antelope.
A hungry lion^on the prowl with a
partiality for human meat is a dan
irerous customer to encounter and the
track walkers on the Uganda Railway
always go armed and usually in cou
ples to b* prepared for such an emer
gency. Some harrowing stories are
told of the grewsome deeds of the king
of beasts along the route of the rail
way. Once two men were walking on
the track, one close at the heels of the
other, when a lion sprang upon them
from the brush. The foremost man
ducked and escaped with a few
scratches, but his companion was
knocked over, carried off into the high
grass end devoured. A railway official
â¢was sleeping one night in a side track
ed car. A lion entered the compart
ment and with as much ease as a cat
would carry a mouse bore him off to
the jungle and there made an end of
him. A few nights later the same
beaet revisited the station in which
several of the railway hands were
sleeping and Jumping <m the roof of
the little structure, tried to get at them
by tearing off the corrugated iron
sheeting. Baffled in this he crouched
for the rest of the night by the station
door venting his fury on the signal
flags, which he tore to shreds. Still
more audacious was the lion which
boarded a construction train in which
several workmen were sleeping. Their
cries of terror brought assistance, and
Leo. disdaining to flee, fell riddled
with bullets on the platform of one of
the cars.
So numerous are the animals that
none make a trip over the railway
without Beeing many of them. Huge
herds of zebras are frequently en
countered* browsing on either side of
the track; the shrill scream of the
steam whistle often sends a score or
more of giraffes lumbering over the
plains, while ostriches sometimes dis
play their speed on the approach of
the train and innumerable gazelles
take to flight.
When the road was being built the
natives gave a lot of trouble and fights
were frequent before they learned to
leave the white man and his work
alone. Now their presence can be re
garded as a picturesque addition to
the varied attractions of the trip. They
don't drees for company folks any
Then .occurred a conversation of
great pictorial beauty â the prominent
citizen knowing nothing of Spanish
and the, distinguished Filipino visitor
"seeing him and going him six bet
ter." However, by the aid of the deaf
and dumb language and a paper, and
pencil the kind-hearted American was
able to show that by taking the
limited, which he called "de limitado,"
they would be able to head off the
delegation at Stockton. Together they
boarded the ferry-boat and succeeded
in overtaking the rest of the party,
when the wandering: Filomerlcan was
clasped to the hearts of his beloved
amigos, the thanks of the entire com
mittee fell upon rescuer like an aval
anche and he was invited to accom
pany them all over los Estados Unidos
and back home again.
At this juncture Senor Rosario. who
knew the gentleman, gave a shout of
joy and was prevented from hugging
his rescuer by the united efforts of
two gatekeepers and one ferry police
man. His joy soon turned to woe
when he learned that his companions
had gone.
Before the gateway to the Oakland
ferry at the ferry building a well
dressed man, evidently a Filipino, was
excitedly trying to convey to the gate
keeper the history of his life in six
English words, "El Senor Rosarlo, I
am it," but these were hardly suffi
cient. The gatekeeper, who knew
something of pigeon Spanish, was try
ing to explain that the "boata froma
Oakland hada departedo," and Senor
Tomaso G. del Rosario, whilom Gov
ernor of Bataan and member of the
Superior Advisory Board of Public In
struction of the Philippines, was al
most in tears. \
At this juncture a promlnetn citizen,
who had accompanied the Filipino
visitors to their train on the other side,
came rushing off the boat and ran up
to the gatekeeper. He said excitedly,
"Have you seen an escaped or loose

passionate enthusiasm." On that cele
brated 15th of March, 1848. she scored
such a remarkable success that the
Young Magyar party, of which Jokai
was the leader, sent a deputation to
express to her the congratulations of
the people. There on the stage she
received the deputation, and pinned the
national cockade on the coat of its
leader. At the close of the revolution,
during the period of despotism, Jokai
lived in concealment, occupying his
time with his work of sculpture, the
beautiful Ivory bust of his wife dating
from this time. He wrote, also, under
the pseudonym of Upon the
proclamation of amnesty by the King,
he resumed his own name, and In 1368,
when the federation between Austria
and Hungary was perfected and liberty
was won. Jokai was elected a member
of the first Parliament. He held his
seat in the lower house of this body
for twenty-eight years. In the year
1897, the Emperor, Francis Joseph, ap
pointed him a member of the House of
Lords. Madame Jokai died in 1S86, and
from that time the novelist lived in
retirement in his beautiful villa at
Budapest. He appeared but seldom in
public, one of the dramatic moments in
his later years being hia speech at the
funeral of Kossuth. Standing by the
coffin of his friend, with whom he had
fought for the freedom of Hungary, he
said: "I am the last of that band to
knock at the portals of death, which
by me will soon be closed and never
reopened." â From "Maurus Jokai, Hun
garian Patriot and Writer." by Alexan
der Hegedus Jr., In the American
Monthly Review of Reviews for June.

He scorns the palsying sloth of death.

Of hasting- footsteps; not for him

THE recent action of the directors of the Canada
Woolen Mills, one of the largest in the Dominion,
in deciding to sell their property and. discontinue
business furnishes an object lesson on the comparative
condition of the woolen manufacturing industry in
Canada and the United States. The causes which brought
about their determination will have to be faced by every
other woolen mill in the Dominion, and therefore are
worthy of some attention by those interested in the same
industry in this country.
From a consideration' of t.he facts it appears that the
main reason for the action stated is the impossibility of
competing longer with cheap British goods under the
present peculiar trade conditions. In the matter of va
riety of patterns, quality and style of goods, the Canadian
mills have nothing to fear in their competition with the
old country, but the existing tariff preference permits
the latter's manufacturers to place goods in the Canadian
market at prices that cannot be met. One of the curious
factors that makes that possible is the demand recently
created for shoddy goods, in the manufacture of which
the English mills are past masters. The comparatively
nominal cost of manufacturing shoddy, combined with
the really artistic perfection to which it has been brought,
has made the demand for it by a certain class in Canada
so great that trade conditions have been materially al
tered.
The Canadian preferential tariff provides for a 23 1 * per
cent protection only, which rate has been found entirely
inadequate to stop the flood of the cheap 1 English goods,
so, after due consideration of the element of cheap raw
material and the difference in the price of labor, the
Canadians are giving up the fight.
If we consider that the United States under the Wil
son tariff had a 40 per cent duty and yet nine out of ten
of our woolen mills closed thejr doors, and that condi
tions here are otherwise much the same as in Canada,
we can readily see the hopelessness of the struggle she
is compelled to make. It is true the Canadian tariff on
woolens from countries other than England is 50 per cent
higher, but that fact is scarcely material, since 90 per
cent of Canada's woolen importations comes from Eng
land.
The comparative conditions may be better understood
when it is realized that under the Wilson 40-cent tariff in
1896 our manufactures were stagnated by an importation
of the value of only 64 cents per capita, while Canada with
her slight protection of 23M per cent, imports annually $2.49
per capita. Under the stimulus of the Canadian preferen
tial tariff her woolen imports have increased over 40 per
cent in the past five years, which means a like reduction in
the amount manufactured at home. Under the present
prosperous condition of things in the United States with
a oo-cent tariff we import woolens to the value of 25 cents
per capita only.
As the effect of the tariff conditions existing in Canada
to-day the majority of the people of that country are
clothed in Engljsh shoddy goods, with their home woolen
mills closing their doors, while 94 per cent of the goods
we wear in the United States are domestic, purchased at
a reasonable price, with our manufactures in a flourish
ing condition.
PHILIPPINE PROGRESS.
A young collegian stepped from the narrow path the
other day and his fall has been made the theme of sharp
and biting criticism for the gossips. The incident of this
young rascal's disgrace is worthy of discussion simply
to refer attention to the fact that in a college education
he had better opportunities than most boys to protect and
promote his moral nature and not to degrade it.
Many attempts have been made to
invent some apparatus adapted to the
transmission of photographs,* hand
writing, etc., over long distances by
means of the electric current- A really
successful device appears to have been
perfected by Professor Korn of
Munich- The sending: device is on the
principle, which has been known for
some time, of the oscillations in elec
tric, currents due to the variation in
the' intensity of light falling on a
selenium -cell. If a photographic
negative has a ray of light falling
upon it from above, and a selenium
cell resting below it, then when the
negative is moved we have changes in
the electric current due to the differ
ences in the amount of light passing
through the negative. The difficulty
has been to find a receiver which
would reconvert the electric oscilla
tions into changes in light intensity.
This is the problem that Professor
Korn has solved. He observed that
the luminous radiations from the elec
trodes In a tube exhausted to a pres
sure of .2 to 2 mm* of mercury were
very sensitive to variations In the cir
cuit. By an ingenious mechanical con
trivance he was able to make these
rays act upon a photographically sen
sitive film, producing a picture of the
variations in the electric circuit. When
this tube is connected with the selen
ium cell of the transmitter, in such a
way that slight variations in Its cur
rent affect the amount of electricity
in the circuit of the receiver, an ac
curate reproduction of the light re
ceived is given by the light emitted.
This apparatus has already given
satisfactory reproductions of hand
writing and photographs.

The extraordinary gifts of the butter
fly race have always excited the won
der not only of naturalists, but of the
most ignorant observers. Their silent
and unseen changes; the Instinct by
which they distinguish their favorite
plant food, as, for instance, even
among the scarcely differing species
of the complex race of asters, where
they show themselves, as Professor
Asa Gray said, "better botanists than
many of US"; their skill in depositing x
tbelr eggs unerringly on or near the
precise plant on which the forthcoming
caterpillars are fitted to feed, although
they as butterflies have never tasted
it. To these should be added their lux

the brief time when, if ever, their eggs
must be laid and the continuance of the
race made sure. The whole realm of
animal "mimicry," as it is now termed,
reaches its highest point in them, and
leads to some extreme cases; as in the
fact that, while butterflies are ordina

widely from this rule that the male has
not one mate only, but actually three

THE, Daily Bulletin of Manila, P. I., on May 1 pub
lished its anniversary edition. It is. in three sec
tions and comprises altogether fifty-six pages,
which in subject matter, makeup, paper and printing,
compares favorably with the special editions of many of
the big metropolitan journals of the home country.
The paper was started in 1899 as a small four-page
daily, more of a shipping and custom-house bulletin than
anything else, and its present proportions and importance
as a general news journal speak volumes for the energy
and progressive spirit with which the, Americans have
undertaken the development of the Philippines. The
old days and methods of the Spanish regime have passed
away, and all things have become new. That is true
not only of the cities and the larger towns of the islands,
but in a measure of the whole archipelago.
In the edition under review there are many articles
treating at length of the chief subjects of interest in the
islands to the people of the United States. "The Im
provement on the Port," "Tariff Revision," "Insular Cus
toms," "The Currency," "Progress Effected by Ameri
cans," are Â»among the more interesting and instructive.
Others hardly less so are "Agricultural and Industrial
Subjects," "Manila Hemp," Philippine Lager," "Increase
of the Water Supply of Manila,". "Mineral Industry,"
"Tobacco Culture," "Railway Building in the Philip
pines," etc., etc.
All these are well written by men well acquainted with
their subjects and with well executed half-tone pictures.
The third section of the issue is devoted, to "The
Honorable Philippine Commission." The origin and his
tory of that governing body is given with full description
of the varous bureaus and organizations through which
its work has been done, with pictures of all the more
important officers in each. Taken altogether the edition
makes an impressive showing of the results of American
rule in the Philippines and reflects credit upon the
editors who prepared it.

The Great Assouan Dam.
Assouan, that seventeen years or so
ago, to the best of my recollection, was
a village with one inn, where the great
attraction was to see Arabs shoot the
boiling waters of the cataract with a
goat skin for a boat, is now an inter
national health resort, without any
cataract to speak of.
At least there is none at this season
of the year, for the dam hat
altered all this. By way of
compensation there are several great
hotels, one of them, "The Cataract," a
finely planned building commanding a
beautiful view of the rocky Nile.
Hither come not tourists only, but
many sick from England and America,
as the dry air and splendid, sunny
winter climate are excellent for various
diseases.
Most people, though they be neither
travelers nor invalids, have heard of
the Assouan dam and reservoir, and
also of the Island of Philae, near by,
and its beautiful temples, the ancient
"City of Isis" and "Holy House" as
it was called by the old Egyptians.
To this dam I had the advantage of
paying two visits, and in view of Its
importance to the future of Egypt, the
information that I collected concerning
It may prove of interest. To begin
with, it is frequently and erroneously
called a "barrage," which it is not.
The word "barrage" means a guiding
wall, a barrier fhat does not store
water, but turns it in a desired direc
tion. Of these there are several in
Egypt, but I think that the only dam
and reservoir is at Assouan.
The best view of this wonderful work,
which has now been in operation for
about two years, Is to be obtained from
the massive granite wall that forms the
dam. This wall is over 2000 yards
in length and crosses the Nile from side
to side. On the crest of it. that is
twenty-six feet wide, runs a tramway,
along which the visitor, seated on a
rough trolley, is propelled at speed by
Arabs. Hence to the north he sees
a great extent of shining rocks, be
tween which the water runs in* chan
nels, and to the south a vast lake,
that in some places attains a depth of
nearly 200 feet.
This is the reservoir, and all the
weight of It and of the Nile for the
150 miles or so that it Is held up, is
pressing against the wall on which he
stands. In this wall are 180 sluices,
worked by machinery, which are suf
ficient to deal with every conceivable
contingency of flood. Sometimes more
of them are open and sometimes few
er. On the day of my second visit
(March 13) only Fix of these and a
part of a seventh were open. Through
these seven openings, each of them
six feet fix inches wide by twenty
three feet deep, the whole Nile was
rushing at the rate of 702 tons of
water per second, the amount that, ac
cording to the calculation of the en
gineers, it was necessary to pass that
day.
It is a wondrous thing to see the
pent-up water gush in torrents of
foam through these narrow gates with
a force so fearful that it appears im
possible that masonry built by man
should withstand their thrust and
wear. But such fears are groundless.
If it continues to be properly watched
and attended to, there is no reason
why this dam should not last as long
as the Pyramids. â H. Rider Haggard
In The London Mail.
The young man who pleaded the other day for a

ly be a popular one with American
tourists. The railway company charges'

accompanying show for nothing. But
the conditions which make It unique
muÂ«t soon give -way to the march of
civilization.
THE commercial returns for the past week and for.
the month of May as far as received indicate no
deviation from the downward trend in prices and
the increasing dullness in general trade. There is the
same increase in stocks of manufactured products, the
same plethora of money and the same diminution in the
demand for goods, especially for those descriptions de
manding the greatest expenditure of money.
But there are no signs of any trouble or of any violent
disturbance in business conditions. Everybody now sees
that the feverish activity of the five or six years follow
ing the first election of President McKinley has passed
and that the country has entered upon an era of trade
quietude, in which conservatism will be the dominating
force. Nobody expects anything in the nature of a panic,
for there is nothing in current or prospective conditions
to cause one. Besides, there is too much money in the
country. It is simply a transition from a boom to regular
normal trade conditions. "
In fact, business is not really very dull. It is only the
contrast with recent conditions that makes it appear so.
Our foreign trade is keeping right up to its reqent. volume
as a rule and our domestic distributive trade is making
a very satisfactory showing. In reviewing the country's
trade for the fiscal year up to May 1, Bradstreet says:
"It is worth noting that imports for ten months
?re 4 per cent smaller than last year, exports are 4 per
cent larger; and exports, in fact, are the largest ever re
corded for that period, exceeding the hitherto record
fiscal year, 1901, by 1.3 per cent. It is hardly likely that
this latter gain can be maintained during May and June,
however. The excess of exports over imports during the
ten months of the present fiscal year is $448,856,321, which
i. larger by $89,551,402 than the excess a year ago, but
is smaller thai! in the years from 1S99 to rooi, inclusive."
This exhibit speaks for itself. As long as the country
can keep up such a showing it is all right. Times may
become quieter without getting really hard. It is very
probable that from now on for an indefinite period very
few new enterprises, at least those of a gigantic char
acter, to which the country had become accustomed dur
ing the past several years, will be undertaken, and the
nation will content itself with proceeding in the good,
old-fashioned way of buying and selling a fair amount of
goods at a modest profit, without scrambling like pigs
at a trough to see who can make the most money and
get rich the quickest.
Our net incomes then will doubtless turn out as large
as they have been, when the decreased expenses arc fig
ured into the calculation, for the American people have
been burning money in a most reckless, not to say almost
criminal, way ever since the great boom started, just be
fore the Spanish war. Our extravagances, both com
mercial and private, have been the wonder of the civilized
world, and it is high time to call a halt. That new en
terprises have received a decided check is demonstrated
by the fact that new incorporations during the first four
months of this year were scarcely one-third of those
created in the same period of 1903 and 1902.
The leading factor at the moment is the condition of
the crops, for on them much of the prosperity of the
country depends. Fortunately the outlook in this direc
tion is good. Cotton, corn and spring wheat are all
looking very well, though the season is generally a fort
night late. The most aftute and conservative observers
among the great financial interests express the opinion
that with good crops we may reasonably expect a trade
revival along in the fall, but it is doubtful, as The Call
has already pointed out, whether there will be any im
provement over present conditions before 1005. for the
close of the year is always quiet, and especially in a
Presidential year. Still, with abundant crops and large
supplies of money, business stands a good chance for at
least moderate activity after the turn of the year.
The usual returns, upon which commercial circles base
their calculations, are still unfavorable, as already stated.
The volume of May business was lighter than that of
April, and showed a falling off from the same month last
year. Railway earnings were also smaller, with the com
panies reducing operating expenses in many directions.
Bank clearings were smaller and failures more numerous,
though the latter included none large enough to attract
especial attention. The clearings last week were 22.4
per cent less than for the corresponding week in 1903,
and the aggregate clearings touched the low point of
$ 1 ,574.780,000. The average of these weekly clearings
for the past year has been about $2,000,000,000, and for
several years prior to this generally ran along about
$2,400,000,000. These reduced figures show the shrinkage
in trade during the past few months better, perhaps, than
anything else in the way of statistics. The only cities
showing a gain last week were St. Louis. Kansas City
and New Orleans, and the falling off comprehended al
most the whole country, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
Still, not all the returns are unfavorable. A number of
commercial lines are sending in very fair reports. Some
Eastern, Western and Southern points are reporting a
better demand for fall goods. New. England points to
a very fair movement in footwear. The three Pacific
Coast States have to hustle to get sufficient farm produce
to satisfy the domestic and foreign inquiry for forage,
and crop conditions all over tne coast are excellent. The
outlook is for another fine year on the Pacific Coast, no
matter what happens in -the other parts of the country.
We may quiet down with the rest of the nation, but from
present indications we are to enjoy another prosperous
year.
Eastern industrial companies, it is estimated, will pay
out about $15,600,000 during June in dividends, as com
pared with $18,800,000 a year ago and $20,000,000 two
years ago. The passing of the common dividends,
amounting to $5,084,952, on United States Steel caused
the reduction in part, but this was partially offset by an
increase of 1 per cent, involving $975,000, in the Standard
Oil quarterly dividend.
The quarterly statement of the Fall River, Mass.. rftill
dividends, just issued, shows that, despite the high price
of cotton, low quotations for cloth and general uncer
tainty in the market, Fall River factories have continued
to operate at a profit to stockholders. The last quarter
gave an average of 1.10 per cent on a capital of $21,745,
000. The dividend for the corresponding quarter last
year was 1.38 per cent on a capital of $21,363,000.
With bank vaults gorged with ready cash, Wall street
continues as dull as any spot in the United States. The
public cannot be coaxed into stock speculation. They
6imply will not step a foot into * the speculative field.
They are content to peer over the top rail of the fence
and contemplate the sleepy biills and bears. The banks
would be only too glad to nave them, use some of the
surplus money in stock speculation, for the vaults are

The California deciduous fruit season opened
April 30 with the shipment of a single box of
cherries, closely followed by other single box
shipments. There has been a good deal of
dlkcutslon over the question of who made the
Initial shipment, but it seems to be conceded
that the honor is due to the Prank H. Buck
Company of Vacavllle. Solano County, and that
the first box of cherries to leave the State was
grown in the Robinson Brothers' orchard of
that place.
This box was closely followed by one from
the orchard of J. H. Smith, Vacavllle, shipped
through the Earl Fruit Co., and another from
the orchard of D. D. Gammon, Sacramento
County, shipped through the Pioneer Fruit
Company, Sacramento city. These three boxes
brought â¢Â¦ fancy prices, as the first .California
cherries always do. The Sacramento box was
the first to b* sold and brought, at private
sale, In the city of Chicago. $25.

REMEDY IS ; PROPOSED."
It wou,ld be merely quoting the opin
ion of engineers to say that the only
remedy for this is the storage of the
flood waters of these streams. All of
the tributaries of the two drainage
channels of the valleys might be eco
nomically stored when they reach the
general level of the plain below, while
up the mountain courses of many of
theso streams there is .ample opportuni
ty for holding back the flood waters
and feeding them into the main chan
nels at a rate consistent with their
drainage capacity. In, the course of
time' this will be done. In the natural
course of events the Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys will be irrigated
and irrigation uniformly destroys
rivers. -i>
The Government of the United
States has entered upon a scheme of
arid land reclamation by irrigation, as
relates to the Colorado River, which
will destroy the navigability of that
stream. It has already assumed the
position that the superior public uses
of the Colorado River is irrigation and
not navigation. Water sufficient to
irrigate the great interior basin of this
State must necessarily be stored. The
summer stages of all the streams,
which when combined create the Sac
ramento and San Joaquin rivers, are
not equal to the demand for the Irri
gation of these great valleys. When
the aggregate precipitation of com
mon years is accumulated by storage
and devoted to the fertilization of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin plains,
the flood stages of the Sacramento and
San Joaquin will disappear.
Combination of meteorological con
ditions will create floods at wide in
tervals of time, which will be mora
or less destructive, but the usual con
dition will be full channels all the year
round attended by navigable condi
tions of the highest economic value.
That this result will be achieved is in
evitable and the force that will bring
it into being is the obvious values to
be developed by the undertaking.
The task of impounding the flood
waters of the streams supplying the
great interior water ways appears
stupendous only to those who are un
familiar with precedent. We stand ap
palled before the vast sums of money
required for its accomplishment, but
the magnitude of these sums sink into
comparative insignificance when
measured by the stupendous aggregate
of values to 1 be created and the vast
populations hereafter to be sharers in
the Incalculable benefits.
The history of engineering experi
ment and theory presents merely chap
ters of failures. Engineers were found
to approve of the drainage act under
which an attempt was made to im
pound the mining detritus by the con
struction of brush dams. The dis
tinguished engineer James B. Eads
was brought to the State for the pur
pose of .bearing testimony in favor of
the practicability of that scheme. He
gave a very reluctant assent, saying
that the experiment was worthy the
trial, but the experiment merely dem
onstrated the utter fallacy of all the
theories concerning it. Two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars of State
money was expended to make this one
experiment. The channel of the Yuba,
a high altitude tributary of the Feather
River, was selected for the experiment.
The first flood destroyed the works
that had been erected for jts control,
with an imperious disregard for engi
neering theories.
The Sierra Nevada tributaries of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers
have a velocity of current which makes
it impossible to check, arrest or im
pound their waters in their channels.
The force of ten thousand cannon balls
would be feeble in comparison with the
torrents which sweep with destructive
velocity down these streams. A stone
dam anchored to the bedrock might
be constructed to stand, but the res
ervoir area would fill up the first sea
son and the detritus which results from
the perpetual erosion of the mountain
declivities would simply fall over the
top of the dam and possess no eco
nomical value unless for creating elec
trical power.
CHAPTERS OF FAILURES.
with it destroyed the engineering
theories that such reclamation is not
an obstruction^ to the outflow of the
floods. The recurrence of great flood3
is just as certain as the recurrence
of the rainy season.
Uplifted areas like those which
constitute more than ' half the
interior basin, must necessarily
suffer erosion when the surface
of their escarpment is broken by the
pasturage of domestic animals and the
general occupation of man. This ero
sion was accelerated by hydraulic and
other mining, but it had been in pro
cess centuries before California was
inhabited and will continue in all the
centuries to come. In a comparatively
recent period the system of bays ex
tended to the mouth of the Feather
River and up the San Joaquin as far
as Stockton. In the process of time
Suisun Hay will be filled and the Sac
ramento and San Joaquin rivers will
â¢flow through one well-defined channel
into the Straits of Carquinez and
thence to the sea.
Following the Sacramento on both
sides the game condition is maintained.
Cow Creek, Deer Creek, Antelope
Creek, Mill Creek, Rock Creek, Pine
Creek and Butte Creek on the east and
Elder Creek, Red Bank Creek Cotton
wood Creek, Toms Creek and Stoney
Creek on the west, all in the high al
titudes, receive nearly double the an
nual precipitation of rainfall in their
upper courses of that which visits the
Immediate area of the Sacramento
River, .and delivers this precipitation,
by reason of the inclination of the
mountainous district, down channels
which make their currents necessarily
torrential.
Then the Feather River, two-thirds'
of whose drainage area stands at an
angle of from 15 to 60 degrees, is en
countered, and the Yuba and Bear
rivers, branches of the Feather River,
are practically mountain torrents. '
THE AMERICAN RIVER.
Topographical facts relating to the
To this point, we have but one side
of the 6tory. We have brought to view
a river 125 miles in length with an aver
age fall of less than three inches to the
mile. We must now consider the to
pography of the catchment area and
rainfall which feeds this river.
The two rivers which flow to the
north and to the south and which, turn
ing abruptly west at right angles to
their general course, drain two great
valleys having the Sierra Nevada
Mountains for their eastern and the
Coast Range for their western wall,
drain these two ranges of mountains
to their very summits, and fully 60 per
cent, or 42,000 square miles, of their
catchment area has an inclination of
from 10 degrees to CO degrees. Upon
this uplifted area two-thirds of the
entire precipitation of both valleys
fall. While this statement is sufficient
ly comprehensive to those familiar with
the facts, for the sake of perspicuity
it will be illustrated in detail.
The Sacramento River rises at the
north line of Township 40 north, in a
straight line, 250 miles by . math
ematical demonstration from the
top of Mount Diablo. From its
source to the head of the Sacramento
Valley, in a straight line a distance
of 48 miles. It has over 3000 feet fall.
It receives Fall River, McCloud River
and Pitt River as Its eastern tributa
ries, and these rise at an altitude of
between 3000 and 4000 feet. They have
an average fall of nearly 100 feet to the
mile in their entire course.
The annual precipitation in the
mcuntain district, which constitutes
the catchment area of the upper end of
the Sacramento system, is more than
twice the annual rainfall at Chico, and
in addition to this the area is subject
to phenomenal precipitation, as for in
stance, five or six Inches in from six
to ten hours at Delta.
As the American pioneers found this
primitive condition, the tide rose and
fell every day at Knights Landing,
thirty-five miles by the channel of the
river above Sacramento, and the tide
influenced the drainage capacity of
the San Joaquin as far inland as
Stockton. When the Central Pacific
Railroad was built, in pursuance of an
act of Congress granting aid for the
construction of a railroad from the
Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean,
Sacramento was accepted as the Pa
cific Ocean terminus because Pacific
Ocean tides were encountered at that
point.
The tides of the ocean, then, ob
struct the outflow of the waters of
the San Joaquin and Sacramento
rivers to a distance of over 125 miles
from the mouth of the combined rivers
8t the "western outlet of the Golden
Gate. The Sacramento River, opposite
the city of Sacramento, has an eleva
tion of 30 feet above sea level, or less
than 3 Inches to the mile of its -course
to the sea. The ebb tide through the
Golden Gate vastly exceeds the flood
tide which flows inward, because it
carries ' outward the water which the
tide has delivered to the tidal reservoir
composing the bay system and the ac
cumulated and obstructed waters of
the vast catchment area already dis
closed.
TOPOGRAPHY OF AREA.
This single river, which flows
through Suisun Bay, the lower portion
of San Pablo Bay and the upper end
of San Francisco Bay to its final point
of emptying or drainage into the sea,
is without name, being overshadowed
by geographical designations in the
way of names of bays; but the law of
gravitation operates quite unconscious
of the names of the lakes or basins
through which a river flows. In very
truth the west end of the straits of
the Golden Gate is the mouth of the
combined rivers which flow into the
Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers
and the Suisun, San Pablo and San
Francisco bays, and when all these
are taken into account, that is, when
the streams that flow into the bays,
including the Napa River, Petaluma
Creek and the drainage of the Santa
Clara, San Ramon and other valleys
tributary to the bay system are con
sidered, they form one single river
having a catchment area equal . to
75,000 square miles, which reaches sea
level through the Golden Gate.
The paramount factor, when drain
age is under consideration, is the re
lation of this sea level to the high and
low water in the system of bays and
the direct influence which this sea
level has upon the lower courses of
the Sacramento and San Joaquin
rivers.

Joaquin and Sacramento rivers em-

! miles.
These two valleys of the Sacramento
i and fcjan Joaquin may be termed the
! interior ba*in of California. From
j the highest point of watershed on the
! south to the source of the Sacramento
| River, near" Mount Shasta on the
; north, the distance in a straight line
i is about 525 miles. Of this 275 miles
i belongs to the San Jouquin and 250
i miles to the Sacramento. Both rivers
I constitute the central drainage of a
i region lying between two ranges of
! mountains. The Sacramento Hirer,
i the- drainage of the northern portion
! of this basin, flows south; the San Joa
| quin River, the drainage of the south
! ern portion of the region, flows north,
! until they find their coniluence on the
I eastern margin of Suisun Bay. From
j this point to their outlet to the sea.
I at the west end of the straits of the
I Golden Gate, they are one river.
Captain Spillane and a squad of po
licemen kept the south side of Market
street, from Fourth to Sixth, clear of
vehicles and pedestrians. The depart
ment made every effort to keep the
event a secret, that too many people
would not assemble to see the run,
thereby causing accidents or impeding
the way of the horses, and Just a suffi
cient crowd appeared to contribute in
cidents and add detail to the picture.
The chemical passed Fifth street,
where the picture machine was placed,
first, at a record-breaking gait. Then
came Acting Chief Dougherty and the
engines and other equipment dashed by
at intervals of a few seconds. Harry
J. Miles, representing the American
Mutoscope and Biograph Company,
took the pl6tures and will put them in
shape for the exhibition. Although the
films have not yet been developed.
Miles says there is no reason why they
should not excel anything of their
kind ever shown.
Biograph pictures of the San Fran
cisco fire department responding to a
first alarm of fire were taken yesterday
afternoon at Fifth and Market streets.
The films will, be used by the Mer
chants' Association in connection with
the San Francisco lecture ' department
at the St. Louis Exposition. Every fa
.cllity was afforded the operator to se
cure good views and the nine pieces
of apparatus that will appear in the
run went at break-neck speed, showing
the department in the best of prelim
inary action.
About 1 o'clock the section of depart
ment apparatus that had been selected
by Acting Chief Dougherty assembled
on Fourth street, near Market. Truck
1, engine 17 and wagon, battery 1,
chemical 1 and the water tower and
light wagons, driven by Acting Chief
Dougherty and Battalion Chiefs Wills
and Shaughnessy, were in line. The
horses were white and the apparatus
was of the latest improvement. The
battery and the water tower are both
local inventions and will attract inter
est when shown abroad.
No hacks went out last night with
unlicensed drivers. The intention of
the owner* to put men on the vehicles
was not carried out for the reason that
men could not be secured who were
wiling to take the chance of being
pummeled and after that treatment
arrested, even though the owners were
willing to defend them in the courts.
Members of the union will be on
hand Tuesday night to watch the pro
ceedings of the commission and also
to try to get all those who are granted
I>ermits to join the union.
Hackmen are having trouble over
payment of dues and assessments.
Those that are working have to ad
vance a given amount every week in
order to remain in good standing with
the union. Some of the men are be
ginning to complain and there are In
dications of trouble in the organiza
tion.
The union says it has had nothing
to do with the cases of assault, though
it is known that union men have made
the assaults. It is the intention of the
union to look out for every man placed
on hacks and if he cannot produce his
permit from the Police Commissioners
to complain against him and ask for
his arrest.
There are more than 100 hacks
owned by the association and thus far
there have been but twenty-five appli
cants for positions. Of that number
only one was granted a permit by the
Police Commissioners.
Owners take the position that as
ell the stables allied against the Hack
Drivers' Union are paying taxes on
their properly they are entitled to the
lrotection of their business. The only
thing to <lo, they say, is to start men
out and if arrests are made to fight
the cases. The owners expect arrests
to be made and the men who go out
vill be warned accordingly. Such ac
tion will bring the license question into
the courts, but the lawyers engaged by
the owners say they can win.
Tuesday night the Police Commis
sioners are to meet and pass upon sev
eral applications for licenses. Formal
application will be made for the grant-
Ing of permits to several men who
have applied for work. If the board
rejects the applications, the men will be
X'Ut to work, provided they are willing
to take chances with the thugs.
Stable and carriage owners have had
ail the delay they will stand regarding
the placing of their hacks on the
fireets. That decision was reached
yt-sterday and there will be no
more delay about putting the
hack* on the streets if men
can be obtained. Just what the city
officials will do is conjecture. The law
pays hack drivers must have licenses,
but the owners have concluded that
the withholding of licenses on the pre
text that the applicants do not know
enough about the city was going too
far and they are ready to test the
question.

Problem of Drainage
Is Related to Im
pounding.
Outflow Is Greatly
Blocked by the
bea. 1 ides.
The Sacramento and San Joaquin
are tidal rivers for nearly 100 miles of
their lower courses and must receive
these torrential floods and deliver
them to the ocean through channels
which have but thirty feet fall in 125
miles.
it is that, after an American
occupancy of fifty-five years, the prob
lem of drainage remains unsolved.
But little has been learned and ab
solutely nothing has been done to
meet the exigencies of the situation.
The great flood of the early 50's, the
greater flood of February, 1861, and
the recurrent great flood of 1904 mani
fested the same destructive tendencies
that would have attended them 100
.years ago. They destroyed the island
reclamation at the mouths of the Sac
ramento and San Joaquin rivers, aad
RECEIVE THE FLOODS.
Owing to the greater rainfall upon
the catchment area of the Sacra
mento, its flood stages are often higher
than those of the San Joaquin. The
observation of this phenomenon ha3
led to the fallacy of supposing that
the Sacramento might be relieved by
turning its waters into the channel of
the San Joaquin by an artificial canal;
that. is. invoking the aid of the San
Joaquin in the drainage of the
Sacramento. But the sea level status
of Suisun Bay is the controlling
factor when drainage is considered.
When the waters of these rivers reach
Suisun Bay they are subject to the
same law; therefore, the proposition
to empty the waters of one into the
channel of the other is attended by
the absurdity of supposing that a
river may empty itself by delivering a
part of its current into its own chan
nel. Both rivers find a common and
paramount obstruction in the ocean
tides of Suisun Bay.
Professor McAdie stated to the
recent River Convention that if the
great storm of last winter had con
tinued three. days the flood waters of
the river would have extended from
the foothills of one range of mountains
to those of the other, submerging the
entire valley. This, indeed, is just
what did happen in the flood of Feb
ruary, 1861.
The meteorological conditions to
which the recurrence of great floods
in the interior basin are referable are
familiar to all the residents of the
valleys. One foot of newly-fallen snow
Is equal to one inch.of rainfall, bat
when ten feet of snov is found it
equals fifteen or eighteen inches of
rainfall, because the snow has com
pacted by its weight. When the up
per courses of the tributaries of the
Sacramento lying from 5000 to 6000
feet above the central drainage of the
valley contain from five to ten feet of
snow and receive a precipitation of
fiom ten to fifteen inches of rainfVl
within three days that carries off the
snow, the water is delivered to the
drainage channels of those tributaries
as rain runs off the steep roofs of
houses.
When a tide moves eastward through
the Straits of Carquinez drainage of
the great basin is entirely suspended
and. as already shown, there is an ob
structing tidal influence for at least
one hundred .miles up the channels of
both rivers. Thus the low stage of
Suisun Bay affords all the drainage
these rivers can by any possibility
have. But the elevation of Suisun Bay
is determined by the relation of the
sea to the bay system and the lower
courses of the rivers cannot be changed
or modified except by a change of the
sea level itself.
The upper courses of the American
River have more than double the an
nual precipitation of that recorded at
the city of Sacramento. Graphically
presented, then, draw two straight
lines, pne running. north 276 miles and
the other south 250 miles to a point of
junction, where they turn at right an
gles west to the sea through a single
combined channel; then from the high
summits of two mountain ranges draw
the confluents at right angles with the
central drainage and with the central
axis of the mountains; give these trib
utaries a declivity of from sixty to one
hundred feet fall to the mile and give
their catchment areas double the an
nual precipitation of the lower courses
of the main drainage and we have a
series of torrential streams delivering
flood volumes in a comparatively few
hours into channels which possess the
very meager and limited drainage ca
pacity of less than three inches fall to
the mile.
TIDE STOPS CURRENT.
It is difficult to realize, but it is
mathematically true, that a horizontal
line fifty-four miles long drawn from
the head waters of the American down
to its mouth would stand 6000 feet
above the city of Sacramento, and the
river channel must take up all of this
fall in its course of lefs than seventy
five miles, even by way of the channel
itself. Here is an important tributary
of the Sacramento River, having an
average fall of eighty feet to the mile,
delivering its rainfall and its snow
melt into a channel which, from that
point to the sea, has less than three
inches of fall to the mile.
American River will be given in detail
as peculiarly illustrative of the situa
tion. The American River has its con
fluence with the Sacramento River at
the city of Sacramento. The mouth of
the American River is in township 8
north, range 4 east. It' has three well
defined river channels in township 13
north, range 15 east. The surveys of
the Government show that the distance
between the mouth and the well-de
fined sources of this river is but fifty
four miles and thefee sources are 6000
feet above the mouth of the river.
WH.'MILLS has writ
ten for The Call the
â¢ accompanying article
on the hydrography of the Sac
ramento Volley. The theme is
intimately related to the drain
age nnd consequently to the. full
development of the great Sacra
mento Valley. Mr. 31111s makes
several noteworthy points, lie
says ilint the'' catchment areas
of the Sacramento and San Joa
quin rivers constitute 48 per
cent of the area of the entire
State of California. The para
mount factor, when drainage is
considered. Is the relation of the
sea level to the high and low
water in a system of bays.
Ocean tides obstruct the outflow
of the waters of the rivers to a
distance of more than 125 milcg
from the Golden Gate. The only
remedy to effectually dispose of
menacing floods is declared to
be the storage of the flood wa
ters by a series of great dams.
As subsequently devoted to irri
gation, these waters will become
instead of being an an
nual menace as at present.

She had a fine record on the At
lantic Coast and for years was the fa
vorite steamer running t out of New
Orleans to Breakwater and other ports.
She will undoubtedly jump into pub
lic favor here at once. She will start
on her initial trip on the Coos Bay
route on Wednesday, June 8, at 9 a. m.
Among tbJosc on board yesterday
were: F. S. 'Samuels, manager of the
foreign department and Coos Bay line
of the J. D. Spreckels & Bros. Com
pany; E. R. Rock, cashier of the com
pany; Police Commissioner Josiah
Howell, Dr. Rethers, C. G. Clinch, A.
C. Diericx, Captain W. S. Manning, su
perintendent of the Spreckels Tug
boat Company: C. A. Hug. secretary of
the Risdon" Iron Works; Herschel
Thomas. A." G. Enslem, F. A. Morris
and N. I. Higuera.
Bob Moore of the Risdon Iron
Works and party had expected to go
on the trip, but they arriv.ed at the
dock just as the boat had backed into
the stream and only had the satisfac
tion of looking at the stanch boat
steam up the bay and shout a few
godspeeds.
quirements,
She Is admirably adaptedTMo the
Coos Bay trade, on which line she is
to run. On her spin yesterday she
first ran lo Hunters Point, where her
new Williamson steering gear was
fully tested.- It acted admirably. She
then ran over the regular Government
course at California City to test her
speed. She made thirteen knots easily,
and when the captain and crew have be
come acquainted with her she will un
doubtedly be able to do better than
this. She will be run more or less
as,, an express boat and should' make
the running time between this port
and Coos Bay in from thirty to thirty
six hours.
She was built in 1880 by Roach &
Sort for the Old Dominion Line, to run
between' New Orleans and Delaware
Breakwater. She is constructed of
heavy iron and, is In much better con
dition to-day than many vessels built
of steel during the last five years. She
is provided with bilge keels to pre
vent her from rolling. She has -new
auxiliary engines. Since her arrival in
this port she has been overhauled at
great expense. Her engines and ma
chinery have been put in first-class
shape and have occasioned favorable
comment of critics in San Francisco.
She is now completely up to date and
will prove a valuable acquisition to
the Spreckels fleet. Her valuation is
about $250,000. Her appointments are
as complete as any first-class ocean
going steamer. She is fitted with elec
tric lights. Her upholstering is of rich
crimson plush and leather and , her
woodwork is of rare old mahogany
and maple. She has fine cabin accom
modations for forty passengers .and
can also take twenty-two second-class
passengers.
The trial trip of the steamer Break

took place yesterday morning and
demonstrated that she is up to re-

Fourtcon-Innlnpr Contest.
St. Louis American Team Triumphs
Over Wasliinston In a Brilliant
IV>Hdinj: Contest for Championship
of Sa n Francisco Postponed
Till Future Date.
On account of the illness of Percy
Murdock his tennis match with Drum
inond Mac-Gavin for the championship
of San Francisco, which was to have
been played at the California Tennis
<"lub's courts yesterday afternoon, as
the conclusion of the recent tourna
ment for that trophy, was postponed.
This was a disappointment to the
larpe number of enthusiastic followers
of the game, who were attracted with
the hope of witnessing some high class
tennis by the experts. All appreciated
the sportsmanlike conduct of Mac-
Gavin in refusing to take advantage
of his opponent's misfortune, thus re
taining the cup by default. When the
two experts meet, each in good form,
a content will result which will be
worth going far to witness.
In the absence of Murdock MacGavin
took on Frank Mitchell for the delec
tation of the spectators, and the re
sult was surprising. It proved to be
one of MacGavin's off days, and judg-
Ing from his play it was fortunate he
did not meet Murdock- Had he played
there would be a new tennis champion
of the city this morning. Mitchell was
at his best and Mac Gavin at his wonst,
the former winning six sets straight
by the following scores: 6-1, 6-1, 6-1,
6-2, 6-2. 6-3.
In doubles Carl Gardner and C. G.
Ku^hn coupled up against Ray B. Cor
nell, and the s=tpady voteran Werner
Siauf. and though it was the second
time thfy had ever played as a, team,
they made a fine Fhowing, winning
three Ftraieht sets. 6-4. 10-8, 6-3.

Wheeler, the local's second baseman,
however, leaped in the air, caught the
ball on the fly and quickly passed it
to Flood at second, who In turn shot
the ball to Chase on first, retiring
the three runners. So quickly had the
play been made that the spectators
scarcely realized it and the excitement
that followed the first triple play of the
season was tremendous. Another spec
tacular play occurred in the fifth inn-
Ing, when, with one out and runners
on the first and second stations. Flood
made a wonderful running catch of
an apparently safe hit Just over short.
He easily doubled up Hlldebrand, who
had started for home from second.

LOS ANGELES, June Â».â In a game
replete with sensational features, the
champions defeated San Francisco by
a score of 2 to 0. A fitting climax to
a brilliant game was a triple play by
the Angels in the ninth Inning, which
in all probobillty saved the day. With
Anderson on second base and Reitz
on first, Massey met the ball squarely
on the nose and drove it on a line be
tween first and second bases. Both
runners, thinking the drive safe, start
ed to make the circuit of the bases.

Coursing Park. In the deciding course
he opened a 1 to 6 choice over The Ref
eree and led all the way, beating his
game opponent by a score of 4 to 0.
Pocatelli, of which much was expected,
succumbed to Red Pepper, a 6 to 1 long
shot, in the third round. This was tho
sensation of the day and the wise ones
were dumfounded at the result.
A large crowd was on hand ' and the

! Well, the people in the stands nearly
threw fits. No one could tell what was
going on, but the Brownies were there.
They played ball and they had luck. In
fact they had everything. Whenever
Oakland was due for a rally something
happened. That's the tale of the two
games yesterday, the baseball sensa
tions of the day on the Coast.
When the news of the morning vic
.tory was winded about Eighth street
it only made the wise ones smile a lit
tle more conspicuously and each was
wont to say: "Well, what a beating
they will give Mr. "Skellim" Roach this
p. mi, just for revenge." Oakland
could not do even that, although Mr.
Roach looked like pie for them.
Oakland had the game all nailed up
and ready for delivery till the fifth.
Mr. Graham developed his usual anti
civilized tendencies, and passed Steel
man. Shea responded with a drive to
center and Roach flew to Ganley, mak
ing the second out. Drennan bit at two
strikes, 'but Graham walked him, fill
ing 'em all up.
Nor could he keep the kinks out of
the sphere when McCreedle faced him.
The first ball struck the Judge and
Steelman was forced in. Nadeau un
loaded a two bagger out to- left and
Shea and Drennan hied themselves
hither. When Mr. Beck eased a be
whiskered liner through second base it
simply brought In the other two men
and broke up the game.
Oakland was still game, however, and
in the sixth it seemed the big stunt
was about to be pulled off. Brick Dev
ereaux commenced with a single to
center and Moskiman was there with a
double to right. On Byrnes' out, short
to first. Brick tripped in and the Doc
arrived while Graham was being gath
ered in, Beck to Steelman.
That was all till Portland drove in
two more during the last period of the
day. "Skellim" Roach seemed to have
everything when his team got into the
running and nobody was allowed to
make any hits off his winders when
they might do some good.
Oakland outhit the Brownies, but
suffered from hard luck and bad base
ball. In the second round Mr. Schlafley
got caught off third when only one
man was out. Two hits closely follow
ed this play and it meant that Oakland
lost a couple of runs. Then in the
fourth Ganley led off with a drive and
Francks popped a short one to right.
McCreedie nipped it and doubled Gan
ley at first, for he started on the hit.
Again in the fifth Devereaux was
caught the same way when Moskiman
bunted out to Roach. The score:

for the pitchers, four of them being

team. The Brownies started in to

PIGEONS FALL TO GUNS ...y
OP WINGSHOT EXPERTS
J. Manning's fawn and white grey
hound Doreen fooled the . talent by
turning up a winner yesterday in the
open stake at Ingleside coursing park.
She beat Queen of Isle in the deciding
course decisively, by a score of 13 to 1.
Her backers secured five to three for
their money. The punishing work
that came to Queen of Isle in the long
courses of the preceding rounds took
away her chance to win. Doreen ran
a bye course with Frisky Boy in the
sixth round and was beaten, serving
further to make her victory in the
final a surprise.
The hard trials in the run-down of
the stake on Saturday put several of
the entries out of commission and the
stewards ordered them withdrawn.
Among these was the good " dog
Rector, which had been picked to win
the stake. Out of the forty-eight
carded to go in the second round eight
were withdrawn and five more de
clined the issue before the sixth round
was reached. There were several lim
it courses. The Conroy-Firm Fellow
course lasted three minutes and forty
three seconds and at the end seven
clogs were in pursuit of the demon
harei Conroy was in when one of the
relief dogs made the kill. Reckless
Acrobat ran an undecided course with
Dear Gaston in the fourth round and
then won 8 to 2, but had to be with
drawn. Following are the results
with Judge Thomas Tlerney's official
scores:

There was much enthusiasm among
the rifle experts who gathered yester
day at Schuetzen Park. The weather
conditions favored good shooting and
a number of marksmen placed high
scores to their credit. The California
Schuetzen Club, Eintracht Shooting
Section and the Grutli Shooting Club
held monthly medal shoots.
Al. C. Gehret of the Grutli Club

margin. Louis Hauser of the same
club carried off the honors in the first
class with 40S.
M. F. Hartter of the California
Schuetzen Club made a fine score of
220 rings in his 10-shot record in the

Chris Meyer with 218 and George
Tammeyer with â¢ 214 were the leaders
of the first class.
F. J. Povey made an excellent record
of 213 in the fourth class and was far
ahead of his competitors. G. M. Barley
in the unclassified column is developing
well. In his two 10-shot scores he made
219 and 215.
Frank Bremer of the cadet class did
some wonderful shooting in his medal
score by making 219 and 215 rings in his
10-shot entries.
In the pistol practice G. M. Barley
with 82 rings to his credit, carried off
the honors with the 6mall arms. An

The fleur de lis of the Garden City
Wheelmen of San Jose, which has been
a symbol of victory on the cycle path
these many years, was strongly in evi
dence yesterday at Ingleside race
course.
The members of the Garden City
team won five of the seven events on
the card. Their most brilliant victory
was in the Australian pursuit race at
ten miles, in which they defeated
eight teams, including riders /from
Reno, Los Angeles and this city. The
priza was a valuable and an artistic
trophy presented by the Cordes Furni
ture Company.
The teams, made up of three men
each, were started an eighth of a mile
apart and each one, upon being over
taken, dropped out. The Bay City
wheelmen were the first to catch a
team, overtaking the California Cyc
ling Club's trio at the end of the third
mile. The Los Angeles team overtook
the Golden Gate Wheelmen and the
Garden City Wheelmen caught .the
Sacramento representatives about the
E^me time. Reno caught the New Cen
tury Wheelmen in the seventh mile,
leaving the four big teams to fight U
out. The Garden City men caught the
Los Angeles riders in the last mile. The
Garden Cities made the fastest time
and won, Los Angeles being second,
Reno third and Bay City Wheelmen
fourth.
There were a number of falls during
the day, but no serious injuries result
ed. Trout, of the New Century Wheel
men, fell in the two-mile race and
brought others down with him. He
fell again near the finish of the five
mile race, when he was leading the
field.
The fastest mile of the day was
made in 1 minute 22 seconds by Young,
on a motor cycle. W. C. Waibel, of
!5an Jose, won the mile handicap in
2:19 3-5.
The day was cold and unpleasant for
both riders and spectators. More than
6000 people witnessed the sport.
The meeting was the first held in
five years under the rules of the Cali
fornia Associated Cyclists, that organ
ization having recently reassumed

HARBIN SPRINGS. June 5.â Jim
Jeffries Is doing little or no boxing
these days, confining his exercises to
gymnasium and road work- He ts
Mrong as an ox and has taken off
so much weight 6inee his sojourn here
that the street apparel he wore on his
arrival looks as If cut and shaped for
<"hang. the famous Chinese giant.
Brown as a berry and looking like
a piece of cast bronze, he was feeling
< herry ripe and warmed up to his work
in great shape this morning. He let
jro all of his reserve force when
punching the bag. a thing he cannot
do when sparring with Jack Jeffries
and Joe Kennedy. Floral pieces would
have found place long ago if he had.
< <ne fierce right hander tore the bag
from Us fastening and it went sailing
through an open window. Fifteen min
utes later it was picked up by a straw
berry peddler just as it was rolling
down the hill into Middletown. Only
the other day the champion said he
felt stronger than . ever before, and
th<re are witnesses in profusion here
willing to go before a notary and take
Â«>ath to the fact.
After punching the bag for twenty
minutes Jeff skipped the rope, worked
the pulleys, indulged in shadow box
ing and then went in for a tug with
the big Jumbo sand bag.
He stopped for only brief breathing
spells, and at the end of an hour was
to all outward appearances fresh and
rosy. Then donning a sweater, trous
ers and road shoes, the boilermaker
stepped several fifty-yard heats in
front of the h<Â»tel that would have
kept a professional sprinter busy. For
a man of his physique, Jeff is a marvel
at the running game and claims a rec
ord of 10 1 *; seconds for "the hundred."
There was nothing doing about the
tamp in the afternoon.

CHICAGO, June 5. â The expecta
tion that the opening day at Harlem
racetrack would throw some light on
the aspirations of several American
Derby candidates was not fulfilled
owing to the condition of the track,
caused by heavy rain.
Flo Bob and Felipe Lugo put in an
appearance for the big race, but in
the fourth event, where it was hoped
Proceeds,^ Prince Silverwings, Mo
hairib. Commodore and Flo Bob would
measure strides, onlv Proceeds faced
the barrier, i
Looking at the performance of those
which did run. Felipe Lugo seemed to
be the only one that acquitted him
self with any credit. With .ninety
pounds, he occupied a prominent po
sition during the greater pa'rt of the
Harlem National Handicap struggle
and finished a fair fifth. The running
of this son of Amigo at Los Angeles
and at Kansas C'ty had shown he has
a liking for a heavy track, but he has
yet to show his ability to carry weight
or go a distance. The heaviest impost
he has yet won with was 106 pounds
at a mile and a sixteenth, the farthest
he has gone.
Proceeds' performance In the mile
event was almost too bad to be true.
He had only 102 pounds up and a
track, according to his running last
year, to suit him. He never seemed
able to run a yard, and performed
even worse than he did in the Ken
tucky Derby. Soufriere, the winner,
which was in receipt of nine pounds
for him, ran a fair race against Bear
catcher at Hawthorne on the 1st lnst.,
but she cannot be considered .a stake
filly.

The radium dance, an addition to the j
third act of Judson C. Brusle's musical
comedy "U. S." at Fischer's last even
ing was a decided and startling nov
elty. Eight chorus girls, attired in
glowing pajamas, maneuver about' a
darkened stage and the effect was mys
terious and entirely new to the theater
goers of this city. The specialty was
invented and is staged and produced by
Lionel Lawrence and holds th'e boards
for several minutes. The show house
is absolutely- dark when the" radium
girls enter. Their pajama garbs and
hats, figures in blue light that throws
no rays, can alone be seen, and the
dances are weird against the intense
blackness. The specialty ends with a
skipping rope dance, the rope ifself a
string of glowing fiber, and the re
sponse from the audience is hearty. A
packed, house greeted the production
last night and. with the radium feat
ure, gave all that was expected. Miss
Hull was obliged, to omit her "star

Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills addressed
three big meetings yesterday at Golden

popular divine has lectured here.
Judging by the enormous and enthu

great popularity has only Increased.
At 11 a. m. he chose for his subject,
"How Can a Man Become Acquainted
With God?" For the 3 o'clock ser
vice he discoursed upon "Three Ways
to Love," and at the evening service
he took for his theme "The Divinity of
Christ." At each lecture the audience
was limited to the full capacity of the

Policemen Edner and Helms halted
the four men as they stepped on, the
dock, and Manager Wilson .went
aboard to consult with Captain San
ford. After the situation had been ex
plained to him he told the policemen
to make prisoners of the four men,
agreeing to swear out a complaint of
mutiny to-day. They were handcuffed
and taken to the Harbor Station first
and later removed to the City, Prison.
Captain Sanford is firm in' the be
lief that the men were guilty, :of
mutiny when they refused to turn to
at the command of the mate "after
leaving Santa Monica. He admits that
when they wanted to quit he did not
have sufficient money to pay- them in
cash and offered the balance in checks
on his owners in this city. When he
offered them their pay in full at Port
Harford he said they had no "right to
demand return passage to Santa
Monica, where they first announced
their intention of quitting. ' .
E. N. Nelson, \ speaking for himself
and his three- companions, said: ,
SAILORS ARE ARRESTED.
Port Harford was the next stop,
and there the skipper tendered the
men the full amount of money In 'cash,'
but they demanded that he also pay
their fare back to Santa Monica,
where they first announced their In
tention of quitting. This he refused
to do and the schooner put to sea'with
the four men aboard.
All during the passage up tlv* ar
rested men .positively refused to lend
a hand in working the schooner, and
apparently enjoyed the increased labor
that had been forced on -the mate arid
the other three hands. When -?tae
schooner docked the mate was obliged
to cast the lines ashore himself and
the four alleged mutineers Jeered at
him. ' 1 .

He put into Kanta Monica to take
on coal and ordered the t'rew to get
ashore and shovel it aboard. The four
men refused to do so. on the ground
that loading was stevedore work, for
which fifty cents an hour was paid.
Finally the four men announced their
intention of quitting, and demanded
their pay from the skipper. They had
$34 apiece coming to them, lie took
them to his cabin and offered each of
them $10 in money and checks on his
owners for the balance. They refused
to accept the checks, and demanded
their entire money in wages. In' order
to load the coal stevedores had to-be
employed. ;* ...
The River Coquille left San Fedro
last Wednesday, bound for this port-
She had sailed from here with a cargo
of lumber with a crew of nine men.
After unloading at. San;"Pedro two of
the crew were discharged. When the
schooner put out from the harbor the
four arrested men waited on Captain
Sanford and protested agiin^t sailing
with a short crew. He told them there
was no necessity for nine men to
bring the schooner back to San Fran
cisco. Â¦ . .
When the pteam schooner River

has been arranged for them.
The electrical display is particularly

art. . The midway was opened with
appropriate ceremonies yesterday af
ternoon by Queen Margaret and her

are'one of the features and the man

sensational novelties, including the

encased in a mammoth sphere.
Music is furnished by the California
Carnival Company's ladies* brass band

A somewhat indifferent piece of stage
dramatization has transformed George
W ' Cable's stirring war-time Â¦ novel.
"Tbe Cavalier."- into a* play which, at
the California Theater i last evening
dragged its great length slowly along
tq an unapplauded finish. The piece
lacks freshness and snap and the capa
ble actors composing the Oliver Mor
osco Company were not wholly able to
relieve the performance from dullness.
There" were bits- of capital acting,
however, that at times showed what
the company is competent to do' with
a suitable vehicle. As usual, the hon
ors were carried off by Miss Amelia
Gardner, whose work In the role of the
Confederate spy was wholly convinc
ing and full of i her characteristic
charm, i Thomas Obcrle. as Captain
Oliver, played, the villain's part' with
force. The scenes between . these two
when marriage has mismated them are
the only ones - of real power." Howard

"A rromantic drammer with only one
slainâ and him not very dead as he
comes to life again in the last actâ is
"A Captain of Navarre,". presented for
the first time here yesterday afternoon
at the Grand Opera House by Mel
bourne MacDowell j and his campany.
Nor is this the only instance of ' the
playwright's moderation. The piece
numbers fights galore, 1 but the hero is
expected to tackle only two or three of
the wretched caitiffs at once. Gypsies
"butt in" to take care of the rest, the
nine or eleven others that usually, fall
to the paladin's blade.
But there are possibilitiesâ or "pos
sabilities," as Mr. Nesbitt Kingsland
1 of the cast likes' it â about "A Captain
of Navarre." It is no worse and 'a
good deal better than many romantic
plays taking up more room. Crude
it is, windy and banal of dialogue; but
there are some genuinely striking sit
uation's, and the people of the play
live in romantic drammer-land. I may
have missed much in missing the first
act, as I did. The second act. that
finds the hero, Rene de Pardaillan, a
fugitive from Justice in the house of the
mother of the man he has killed, has
the real romantic thrill. ' Neither
know who the other is, and the woman
has sheltered him in her bed chamber
and given him permission to go free.
But come then the friends of her son
j to tell her of his death in a duel. She
surmises immediately who is the man
I hidden behind the lace curtains of her
bed. He overhears and understands.
The scene between Rene and the
mother, proud, bitter, revengeful, but
who, noblesse oblige, tells the murderer
of her son that he is still free to go,- is
quite thrilling. ' ' "
The next act sags. Its mechanism Is
j creaky, its movement slow. Yet again,
j there are possibilities in the story. The
! last act explains things not badly, and
with an acre or two of pruned heroics
would go. *
Mr.' MacDowell Is the strenuous hero
Â¦and is quite at home with him. One
| wonders sometimes what Mr. Mac-
Dowell would do in the chestless
drama. Still, 'twould be sad to hide
! such thoracic charms. But his virtues
j are occasionally irritating. When he
! slapped Rene's sternum last night and
i swore: "I will not- go!" (da capo - ad
j lib.) when his sweetheart urged him
! to fly for his life, there was notjiing
i necessarily heroic in the action. But
'there were wads of heroism in . the
! gesture. Still, the actor has nrfany sin
', cere and thoughtful moments in the
; piece and looks the part handsomely.
| His work is altogether. In fact, on a
| tltuiere and more thoughtful level this
season.
Miss Edith Fuller has the part of the
mother, and undertakes it plausibly.
Robert Elliott, who In the braggadocio
role of Annibal Locust â has to stay
drunk for four acts, got all the laughs
and much of the applause. The rest
filled in in fair fashion. The piece

Time has dealt kindly with Truly
SJiattuck. who reappeared at the Or
pheum last night after a three years'
absence. While . deriving stage grace
from her^ experience, in the European
capitals, she lost neither vocal nor
physical charm, ai\d it was a thorough
ly vaudevlllfe artist that her old-time
admirers . greeted. Her voice reflects
conscientious study and the pulchritude
of maturity' accentuates rather than
impairs the curves that once made' her
such a conspicuous component of the
Tivoll stage pictures. She warbled the
ever-bewitching "Violets" with effect
ive nhraaing and then gave a reminder
of the Truly Shattuck.of the years
agone by appearing in the costume of
a- toreador and singing something
about Seville and its chief industry,
which is bull fighting. . .
Marcel's poseurs appeared in several
new pictures, among them a realistic
reproduction of the Native Sons' mon
ument at Mason and Market streets.
Jules Lababe's magnificent physique
was never exhibited to better advan
tage than in the garb, of - the young
Forty-Niner. . V.J'\1

Hebrew songs and impersonations.
Burke and La Rue and the Inky Boys

During the discussion it was con
tended that, with the proper use of
larvicld^B and drainage for eliminating
mosquito breeding conditions, there
vould be vastly lews Ioes of life during
the construction of the Panama canal
than th'-re has ever been in the con
struction of similar wcrrks.
The mosquito and its relation to man,
eÂ« a disturbing factor, has long been a
source ot investigation by scientists
cf th* Agricultural Department and
other experts of the Government. The
marine hospital service, under the direc
tion of Surseon General Wyman, con
ductfd a series of investigations and
all these inquiries agree in the con
clusion that the mosquito carries in
fection and is largely responsible for
the ravages of yellow and other
dangerous fevers.
Henry Clay Weeks of Bay Side.
Ixsng Inland, secretary of the National
Mosquito Extermination Society, read
an elaborate paper on this popular
subject, takins the view that the mos

that, therefore, if thf surface of the
