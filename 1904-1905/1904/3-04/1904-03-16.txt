LOS ANGELES. March 15. â In some
obscure rooming-house where she
cannot be found. Mrs. Sadie Haywaod
is being held a prisoner by a husband
who has sepnt four years in an insane j
asyium and who has written to her j
mother intimating that he may kill I
his wife unless. she promises to leave !
her paramour and return to live with I
him. The woman disappeared last
Thursday, but it was not until to-day
that it became known that she was
in danger. Where she . Is the police
have been unable to â¢ discover, al
though a dozen or more officers are
searching the rooming-houses and re
sorts of the city for her to-night.
She had separated from her hus
band, A. A. Hay wood, a cement con
tractor, and was living with Andy
Peterson, a laborer. " Her mother. Mrs.
W. I. Gallop, knew of the relations.
The husband had caused her trouble
before, but she did not consider him
dangerous. Thursday she left her
rooms to visit her mother and, from
that, time all trace of her has been
lost. * To-day her mother received two
anonymous letters, one from Haywood
and the other from his wife. The
first- letter states that Mrs. Haywood
is concealed in a place where no per
son can find her and her captor pro
poses to keep her until she promises
to leave Peterson. The writer-inti
mates that he will kill her unless she
makes this promise and says "It is a
matter of life or death with her."
In the other letter Mrs. Haywood
writes her mother that she is kept
bound and locked in a room in a. place
she does, not know where. She says
persons are trying to make her re
nounce Peterson. She says she may
not be able to write again because she
doesinot know what those who have
her a prisoner will do with her.
Â¦ The police are making every effort
to find the woman. They advance the
theory : that worry and Jealousy have
brought on a recurrence of Hay
wood's insanity and that he .will kill
his wife. Neither of the letters gives
the slightest clew of the whereabouts
of the woman and Haywood has not
been* seen by his associates for nearly
a week.- .

CHICAGO. March 15.â Union work
ers are to have an opportunity to be
come tillers of the soil. E. P. Dwyer,
a Chicago labor organizer, has con
ceived a plan to raise wages in the
great industrial centers. An agricul
tural company has been organized.
Thirty thousand acres of land near
Wellman. Miss., has been secured and
it is the purpose to put 6000 Chicago
unionists and their families on five
acre tracts, each settler to own his
small farm. According to the pro
moters of the scheme five acres and a
cow. with possibly a pig, will support
in comparative comfort, and certainly
in pence* any .strong-limbed union
worker. The property is to be sold
to union members on an easy pay
ment plan arid provision is made for
the return of the investment if, ufter
trying farming, they prefer, the tur
moil and excitement of city life.
"If 10,000 union workers buy farms
in Mississippi," said Dwyer to-day,
"men now forced to be idle can get
work. - The â¢ competition for jobs 'will
Â¦be reduced and* the law of supply and
demand will force" wages up. The fact
that thousands of idle men can be
found in Chicago at any time' is
proved by the newspapers almost
every day.' It does not make any dif
ference how* many' men* strike â there
are always enough men idle, but will
ins: to work. wh<J are prepared to take
the vacancies, even if some risk Is in
volved." f
Speeial Di^r^tch to The Call
When the House of Commons met
at 2 o'clock this afternoon the me
tropolis was steeped ih its usual mur
ky tranquillity. Scattered throughout
the clubs, hotels and restaurants the
Unionist commoners languidly dis
cussed the vÂ»*ar news and everything
except politl.s. All thought that the
Irish members would take up the
whole of the Parliamentary afternoon
with a verbose discussion ot a quea
tion of but little interest except to the
speakers themselves. In this society
of the luncheon hour hordes of news
boys .suddenly appeared yelling "The
Government defeated."
The early papers only gave the Og-
On the question of Catholic educa
tion Monday night the Nationalists
had voted with the Unionist Govern
ment, but even while doing so they
were planning the downfall of the'
Conservatives. This afternoon the
mine so ingeniously laid was set off
witli a success that thrilled the coun
try. The strategy with which the
whole coup was planned and the
scenes that marked Its culmination
recalled the times when Gladstone and
Parne 11 .waged a titanic struggle In the
same arena.
"Those terrible Irish," as they are
described for the moment by the
Unionists, were entirely responsible
for Balfour's defeat.
STRATEGY WINS.
Premier Balfour regards' it Is one of
the essential principles of his party to
hold on to the reins of the Govern
ment, for the present at any rate.
"What he mav do after Easter still re
mains In doubt. The blow adminis
tered to-day makes the. Premier's task
of holding his party together doubly
difficult and many supporters of the
Government frankly^ said to-night that
they favored an ea'rly dissolution of
Parliament rather than again undergo
the hum Illation* experienced to-day.
LONDON. March 13.â Premier BaJ
four's Government to-day was defeated
in the House of Commons by the com
bined Liberal and Nationalist vote.
This reverse was due to the prohibition
by Wymlham, Secretary for Ireland, of
the teaching of Gaelic in the Junior
grades of the Irish Nationalist schools.
Balfour, although defeated by a ma
jority, on this question, does not re
gaTd the vote as one of want of con
fidence, and he will not resign on this
account. His determination not to re
sign was strengthened by the fact that
shortly after the foregoing defeat ha
was able to secure a majority of 23-
The failure of the Government to
carry the House with it on a question
of purely administrative policy in its
Irish department is generally admitted
to "greatly weaken its already waning
prestige with the country, although it
is not thought probable that any im
mediate dissolvemeat will ensue. In
the House of Commons, to use the
words of a prominent member of the
opposition, "The artillery in the Gov
ernment arsenals would not make them
surrender office."
The entire appropriation named is j
$2,025,000, of -which $500,000 is for
the California site.
This ends the long contest between!
the owners of several ranches in Cal- |
lfernia, which the Nacimiento stood to j
win until very recently. The original j
report of the military commission
distinctly favored Nacimiento and a
bill was prepared and introduced by
Representative Daniels providing for
its selection and appropriating $350,
000 for the purpose. The bill un
doubtedly would have been favorably
reported had not the champions of the
Henry ranch become very active. They i
pointed out that the military commis
sion had not definitely favored Naci
miento, but had recommended a sec
ond investigation _ of several sites â¢
named in th<Â» report, looking to the j
hygienic or sanitary conditions per- j
taining to each. This recommenda- |
tion. they said, had not been regarded j
and should it be Nacimiento would j
certainly be turned down.
Accordingly such an investigation
ras called for bv the committee and '
the War Department delegated med- j
leal officer* from the Presidio to in- !
vestSgate and report.
The report filed some weeks ago
was all in favor of the Henry ranch
from the Senators' standpoint- Since ''
that time Senator Perkins and Rep
resentatives Needham and Daniels
have appeared before the committee
*nd urged the selection of a site in
California without regard to any par
ticular location, but suggesting that
the matter of location be left to the
War Department, as they feared that
the confusion arising from conflicting
reports would result in leaving Cali
fornia out altogether. The action of
the military committee is the subject
af peneral congratulation.
' The J. H. Henry ranch is located in
ran Luis Obispo County and embraces
23,113 acres. It, is not directly on the
sea. a range of hills intervening, but
the sea may be readily reached for

tered and varied fn character, offering
<ieal ground for military, maneuvers.
it is also adjacent to a large tract
owned by the Government.

his present force and advising him of the stupendous arrangements he (Kuropatkiii)

a new era in the Avar; that he will promptly assume the offensive and will sweep the
enemy out of Korea. The commander in chief advises Stoessel that he is forming a

LAST KEYSTONE LAID
IN '"'STANFORD "QUAD"
Interesting Ceremonies Mark the
Completion of the Big Univer

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March
15.â Six hundred students arid mem
bers of the facultv gathered at the
southeastern^ corned of the outer quad
rangle this afternoon to witness the
laying, of the last keystone in the
arches of the outer quadrangle. The
event marked the completion of the
main body of the university buildings.
While the ceremonies were conducted
by the. senior class, others than mem
bers of 1904 participated in the* exer
cises. Charles K. Field, '95, of San
Francisco, one of the most prominent
members of Stanford's pioneer class,
represented the alumni.
The exercises began with the singing
of the Stanford anthem, "Hail, Stan
ford, Hail!" after which Rev. D.
Charles' Gardner, university chaplain,
gave the opening prayer. President E.
G. Brua of the senior class In a fdw
well-chosen introductory remarks in
troduced President Jordan, who said
in part: "When first I came here and
there was only a email group of build
ings erected I was told by the people
at Mayfield that there never would be
a university here â that Senator Stan
ford had just put up these buildings
as, a bluff, because he wanted to run
for President. And that was but a few
nionths before .the university opened
its doors. *â¢
"The university went through many
difficulties in Its early days, but you
have seen it extricated from all these
difficulties and have seen all the build
ings_ put up^'all that remains is to drop
in this keystone to complete the outer
quadrangle.
"When the buildings are completed
then we shall complete, the university.
Many of the departments need flHing
up and new ones will be added.. In
apparatus, libraries and equipment we
shall see this university surpass other
colleges as it has surpassed them in its
buildings;"
Charles K. Field, '95, known to all
Stanford. men and women through his
Stanford verses and stories as "Car
olus Ager,". next addressed the as
semblage. "Ike" Russell, '04, followed
Field, speaking from the standpoint of
a member of the Benior class, which
has seen the outer quadrangle grow
from its inception to its completion.

RIOTS IN, CHICAjGO.
Striking Employes of American Can
"Company Attack Union Teamsters.
CHICAGO, March 15.â A r series of
riots occurred to-day between striking
employes of the American Can Com
pany and union teamsters,, who had re
fused to quit work in- sympathy with
the strike. The first disturbance oc
curred on the north side of the city at
one of the stables of the can company,
a number of men being injured and two
pickets arrested. Two pickets -were
doing, duty in the neighborhood when,
six teamsters attempted- to leave the
stables with teams. The pickets by
signal summoned twenty helpers. The
drivers were stoned, it is alleged, and
dragged from the wagons, the as
sailants fleeing when a patrol wagon
loaded with policemen arrived.
A. second battle started later at the
company's South Side barn. Escorted
by police," a number of ( wagons suc
ceeded, however, in getting half way to
a railway freight house, followed by
threatening crowds.
At Twenty-sixth street and Went
worth avenue the police charged the
mob that was showering missiles upon
the. drivers. The wagons reached their
destinations after the police had cap
tured four of the rioters. The wagons,
with their escorts, stopped at the Erie
railroad freight house at 'Clark and
Fifteenth streets. Girls in the crowd
tried to cut the harness and prevent
the wagons leaving the freight station.
Three of the teamsters, armed with
long whips and aided by a dozen po
lice officers and detectives, drove back
the throng. Girl strikers tried to per
suade the union freight handlers to re
fuse to handle the goods from the
wagons, but the freight handlers, de
clined to enter the fight.
REMOVES DEPUTY POLICE
COMMISSIONER IUGGERTY
McAdoo Dismisses Lawyer Who Re
fuses to- Resign From Hl3
â¢ Office.
NEW YORK, March 15. â Second
Deputy Police Commissioner Henry
F. Haggerty was removed to-day by
Commissioner McAdoo, as he had re
fused, at Commissioner McAdoo's re
quest, to hand in his resignation. This
leaves but one of McAdoo's deputies.
First DeDUty Comniissioner McAvery,
in office. Third Deputy Commissioner
Cowan resigned last week, giving as a
reason the exacting and uncongenial
nature of the position.
Haggerty is 9 law partner of State
Senator P. H. McCarron, leader of the
Brooklyn Democracy, 'and had charge
of the Police Department In Brooklyn.
Reports that his resignation would be
asked for, both on account of dissatis
faction with the police administration
in Brooklyn, between McCarron and
Leader Charles Murphy of Tammany-
Hall, have been current for some time.
The removal or resignation of First
Deputy McAvery Is now looked for.
â¢ . Commissioner McAdoo said that
Deputy Commissioner Â«aggerty*s re
moval was because of a difference of
opinion between Haggerty and him
self as to the policy of police govern
ment in Brooklyn.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 15.â
One hundred and ninety thousand coal
miners of Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, West
ern and Central Pennsylvania, Michi
gan, West Virginia and Maryland drop
ped their picks to-day at noon to cast
their ballots on the proposition to ac
cept or refuse the offer of the opera
tors" for a- two years' scale at a reduc
tion of l>% per cent from the present
scale of wages. The voting was donÂ»
by ballot^ the polls being open from 1
o'clock to 6 o'clock this afternoon. The
ballots were in charge of the secre
taries of the local lodges of United
Mine Workers of America, each miner
being handed one favoring acceptance
of the - scale and another favoring its
rejection. The miner voted his prefer
ence, and at 6 o'clock the polls were
closed. The. secretaries will forward
the result to the national headquarters
here and they will be counted Thurs
dayr
Reports have been received here from
about fifty points. In practically all
of them, including towns in Indiana,
Ohio, West Virginia,. Western Pennsyl
vania and Illinois, the sentiment as
voted is heavily in favor of accepting
the scale as offered. Â¦ . .
President Mitchell and Secretary
Wilson remained at national headquar
ters to-night to receive; any telegraphic
returns, although they said they had
arranged for none- in a_dvance. "Both
were confident that the miners had
voted In favor of the scale. -"
WASHINGTON, March 15.â During
the discussion of the postofflce appro-,
prlation bill to-day, the recent- report
of the Postoffice Department regarding
Congressional solicitation of clerk hire
allowances and rental of quarters to
the Government;, was : again brought
up. Grlggs of Georgia got into an
argument with Cooper x of Wisconsin aa
to the authorship of the document, and
insisted, over the protest of Cooper,
that it* was prepared under the direc
tion of General Bristow. He defended
the committee, of which he is a mem
ber, in giving publicity to the r&port,
saying that the United States is too
powtfrful and too great to convict any
man by a suppression of the facts. He
said the members of the House, after
threats to "tear ;the roof off the de
partment," had turned tail and stated
that the department should investigate
the Congressmen. . \
Burton of Ohio; delivered' a carefully
prepared speech jj on> the question of In
creases in national expenditures, and
warned the House against extrava
gance.
The right of the President to utilize
the yachts Mayflower and Sylph was
questioned by. Cochran of Missouri,
who argued that there was no author
ity of law for it.
The claim of the letter carriers for
increased pay also was espoused by
Cromer of Indiana. He spoke of the
insufficiency of the pay of the rural
mailorders, and said they should not
be deprived the 'privilege of acting as
agents for newspapers.
Townsend of Michigan gave notice
of an amendment he would offer to the
bill to increase the salaries of rural
free delivery carriers to $800 a year.
He submitted a statement of cost to
which, the carrier was put for the
maintenance of his horses and wagon.
This expense was given as $464 for the
first year and $394 for the second.
After agreeing that general debate
on the bill be limited to five hours, the
House at 5:30 adjourned until to-mor
row.
WASHINGTON, March 15. â The
conduct of General Wood while he was
in Cuba serving as Military Governor
during American occupation was held
up to censure to-day in an executive
session of the Senate lasting two
hours by Senator Blackburn, . one of
the members of the Committee on
Military Affairs, who. joined in the
minority report against the confirma
tion of Wood -to be major general.
The speech of Blackburn is said to
have been one of -the continuous flows
of oratory for which he is famous,
and, though puctuated throughout
with denials and questions from
friends of the nominee, was, it is. said,
a well connected comment on the evi
dence given in the committee hearings.
He did not conclude his remarks and
will have the floor at the next execu
tive session.
The programme as it is now ar
ranged provides that Senator Quarles
shall follow Senator Blackburn in a
speech favoring confirmation, Senator
Teller is to address the Senate in oppo
sition and Senator Foraker is to close
for -General Wood. If no general ap
propriation bills are reported to, the
Senate tt) take the right of way it is
thought now an agreement to vote on
the nomination will be reached this
week.
None of the interruptions of Senator
Blackburn consumed more than five
minutes. Senator Foraker and Sena
tor Alger were the most persistent in
denying statements made by the
speaker and some of the passages at
arms proved interesting.
"CHICAGO, March 15.â Three persons,
two of â¢ them being boys, were killed
and eight others injured to-day by an
explosion of toy pistol caps which com
pletely demolished the two-story, brick
manufacturing plant of ibtâ¬ Chicago
Toy Novelty Company at "Western ave
nue and West Eighteenth street. The
wrecked building caught fire immedi
ately after the explosion and the bodies
of the dead were so badly burned and
mangled that it was impossible to rec
ognize them" except by remnants of
clothing. The building â¢ was occupied
by three firms, employing nearly 100
persons each; It is believed some
others may have been killed, but until
the debris, which is piled fifty feet
high, can be cleared away the exact
number of dead cannot be ascertained.
The known dead:
' HARRY JORDAN.
ALEXANDER WILNSKI.
JOSEPH BENDOWSKY, 14 years
old.
It is not known what caused the
explosion and so far as can be learned
the company had no permit from the
city for the manufacture of explo
sives. The caps were of paper and
contained a composition of chloride of
potash, phosphorus and antimony.

IS IT CURABLE?
A Question Often Asked by Those Af-
flicted With Piles.
Is a strained joint curable? Is lo-
cal- inflammation curable? Of course,
If properly treated. So is piles.
People often beconfe afflicted with
piles and ask some old "chronic" who
has always persisted in the wrongr
treatment, and naturally he discour-
ages them by telling them that their
case is hopeless. ,1 * - ;
They in turn discourage others, and
thus a disease that can in every case
be cured by careful and skillful hand-
ling is allowed to sap tho energy of
thousands who might free themselves
of the trouble in a few days.
Pyramid Pile Cure will cure the
most aggravated case of hemorrhoids
in an astonishingly short time. It re-
lieves the congested parts, reduces the
tumors instantly no matter how large,
allays the inflammation and stops the
aching or Itching at once.
Thousands who had resorted to ex-
pensive surgical treatment have been
cured by the Pyramid Pile Cure â in a
.number of instances persons who had
i spent months in a hospital under a
pile specialist.
It is a remedy that none need fear
i to apply even to the most aggravated,
swollen and -inflamed, hemorrholdai
tumore.
If you are afflicted with this stub-
born disease you can master it and
master it quickly.
This remedy is no longer an experi-
ment, but a medical certainty, and Is
sold by druggists everywhere for fifty
cents a package. -â -

A Rheumatic Mystery
Here are some marvels of medicine!
A dose of Aconite will climax at thrÂ«e
o'clock in the morning.
Aloes will operate at five o clock A. Â«.
and Sulphur at eleven o"clock.
No matter what time, in the preceding
day. you have taken these med 1C inÂ«.
they will climax at the fixed hours hew
stated and reveal certain symptoms al-
ways. '
How do you account for this.
How account for a Rheumatic per-
son's ability to predict a coming storm
24 hours ahead, by the peculiar ache in
his bones? 1^VÂ» -
Rheumatism Is slmpty Uric Acid in
the blood. Can Uric Acid have its time
limit. like other chemicals, but reflect-
ing: backward like a barometer?
Uric Acid is due to a lack of Alkaline
material In the blood. This Acid absorbs
the debris, or waste malter. of the sye-
tem.
It carries this waste matter into tho
blood, when there are not enough Allta-
line elements (like salt or soda) Â»o
neutralize the Uric Ac:d. and to free tfce
debris before it reaches the kidneys.
As the blood circulates through the
system, it then deposits small particles
of this waste matter in the Joints and
muscles.
These particles are like granulated
sugar, or sand, and they grind between
the joints and muscles at every- move-
ment. Â» '
Tbis grinding causes intense pain and
inflammation, frequently. If the disease
be not checked, the inflammation will
cause the Uric particles to be coatÂ«d
with a fleshy cushion, which in time
grows to the joints as well. Then "bony
Joints" and crooked limbs ensue.
The only way to cure Rheumatism Is
to convert the Acid condition of the
blood into an Alkaline. Then to diO-
80lve, and carry away, the deposits tn
Joints and muscles.
Then, to get the digestive organs into
a normal condition, so they will secret*,
without further help, less Acid and
more Alkalines. Upon this condition
depends cure, and the permanence Â»f
cure. But â it Is useless to kill Rheu-
matism if we also kill the stomach tn
doing so.
Few drugs powerful enough to dJÂ»-
solve Uric Acid deposits are safe to
taks into the stomach. This Is why
so-called "quick cures" are dangerous.
Rheumatism is slowly acquired, and
so. a cure cannot be expected in a few
> weeks' treatment, and never by external
applications. The first essential in a
Rheumatic cure is safety â the second,
effectiveness â the third, permanence.
In a medical experience of thirty years
I have known but one remedy which
combined these three qualities. It took
nearly ten years of my life to discover
and perfect that remedy.
The chief ingredient I found fn Ger-
many, and to this I added, subtractsd
from, and combined, until I now have a
prescription on which I daily* state for-
tune and repute.
After 2000 test cases I found that "Dr.
Shoop's Rheumatic Cure" succeeded in
39 out of each 40 cases. Then I deciiiod
it was safe to supply it on a month's
trial, at my risk, to Rheumatic sufferers
everywhere.
If It falls, the treatment and s!x brrt-
tles of Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic Cure ccÂ«t
you nbt a farthing, and I bear the whole
cost myself without question.
If it succeeds, the cost to you Is but
$5.50. This is no mere sample proposi-
tion, but a practical guarantee of suc-
cess or no pay. Write me to-day â before
you forget it â for my free Treatise on
Rheumatism.
Address Dr. Shoop, box 2630. Racine.
Wis. Simple cases often yield to one
bottle of Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic Cure.
(Druggists' $1.). But all druggists do
not supply" It on a month's trial. Too
must write to me for that.

In the cases of the Savings Bank of
Santa Rosa vs. Georgiana Schell, the
Supreme Court set aside a Judgment
by default in favor of the plaintiff.
The attorney for the defendant asked
for an extension of time to file a brief
and thought that it was granted him.
When he presented his brief he found
judgment had been entered against
his client. The Superior Court de
clined to set aside the judgment, but
that ruling is reversed by the higher
tribunal.
The court yesterday denied the pe
tition of T. K. Vernon for a writ of
mandamus compelling the Board of
Supervisors of San Bernardino Coun
ty to canvass the returns of an elec
tion which was designed to settle the
question as to the incorporation of the
town of Upland. The Supervisors had
called an election and then rescinded
their action. The election was held,
but the Supervisors refused to can
vass the returns.

GOVERNMENT BEATEN.
A second later the members who had
crowded in realized that the Govern
ment had been beaten, and then arose
such a cheer as Westminster has not
heard for many a day. The Irish and
Liberal members clambered upon
benches and yelled themselves hoarse,
and for nearly five minutes pandemo
nium reigned. Several times Sir Thom
as Esmonde tried to read out the fig
ures, but his voice was drowned in the
uproar.
Balfour, who had been just in time
to vote for the Government, sat smil
ing grimly. Finally there was com
parative quiet, and Sir Thomas Es
monde read:
"Ayes, 141; noes. 130."
At this the storni of cheering broke
out afresh. The Government was de
feated by eleven votes.
A rush to the lobby followed, and the
members animatedly discussed whether
or not Balfour would resign. The Pre
mier, however, set these doubts at rest
by saying that he saw no reason for
such action. Thanks to the prolonged
exuberance c-f the Irish cheers and the
hectoring of Balfour, the Government
whips got the chance of summoning
their absent supporters and when about
ten minutes later John Redmond moved
to report progress on the ground that
the Government had not a majority
able to transact the business of the
Government the Government secured
a narrow majority of 25. If the divi
sion had occurred a few minutes earlier
the Government inevitably would have
been defeated and compelled to resign.
To avert this old men who had not run
for many a year came rushing into
the House, painfully out of breath.
Sir Thomas Henry Carson had not even
waited to put on' a necktie. By a cu
rious coincidence the only other de
feat suffered by the Unionist party
since Lord Salisbury came Into power
and which endangered the existence of
the Government occurred nearly eight
years ago on Thomas. Esmonde's
amendment to Gerald Balfour's land
purchase bill, when it again fell to the
lot of the present chief whip of the
Irish party to declare the Government
in a minority, which on that occasion
was one of only four votes.
AXXOYIXG v JOKE.
The members of the Government
party and their supporters to-night
profess that they regard to-day's divi
sion more, in the light of a joke than
anything; else, although they admit
that it is a particularly annoying joke,
especially in view of the pending by
election. There is no suggestion of
sharp practice, and even the members
of the Cabinet admit privately ' that
they were woefully outwitted by the
"irrepressible Irish."
Sir Thomas Esmonde, in summing
up the events of one of the most
eventful days in recent English politi
cal history, said:
"To-day's division may be taken as
the handwriting on the wall. Expe
rienced parliamentary hands do not
attach undue importance to it, never
theless it unmistakably foreshadows
an approaching dissolution, which to
some extent it hastens. It is a blow to
the morale of the Government and its
supporters and a corresponding en
couragement to their opponents in
Parliament and in the country. It is
enough to know that the Government
has been effectively reduced, how it
does not matter to inquire. We un
derstand that they are in difficulties in
the House, and we know that they are
not as well qualified as they ,are sup
posed to be to carry on the business of
the country.
"The pendulum is already swinging
toward a Liberal revival, and to-day's
events accelerate that movement.
With one or more adverse divisions in
the House an appeal to the country
becomes inevitable. Of course there is
always a chapter of accidents. In
politics the only thing certain is the
unforeseen â but unless the return of
Joseph Chamberlain brings new vigor
and new cohesion to the Unionist
party their race is well nigh run."

ALCATRAZ SOLDIERS
ARRESTED IX TIBUROX
Army Officer Appears Before Justice
and Pleads for Their
Release.
SAN RAFAEL, March 15.â Last Sun
day fifteen or twenty soldiers from
Angel Island rendezvoused on the
waterfront of TIburon and, as a result
of heavy drinking, there was a general
free-for-all fight. Constable Edwards
attempted to intervene and nearly got
the worst of it. He succeeded, how
ever, in corrallng four of the men, but
later three of the prisoners escaped
him. The citizens were thoroughly in
censed over the conduct of the soldiers
and went before Justice of the Peace
J. H. Pryor in Sausalito and swore out
warrants for their arrest. The military
authorities at first refused to give up
the men.
This afternoon an officer and about
twenty-five soldiers appeared. The
citizens who appeared as witnesses
were unable to identify positively any
one of the soldiers as miscreants. The
captain pleaded for his men and asked
that he be permitted to chastise the
j prisoners, claiming that if they were
I released from the civil authorities the
\ military punishment administered
would he much more severe than any
that Judge Pryor could give them.
Judge Pryor finally decided to allow
this, but admonished the officer that
the county of Marin would permit no
more such acts as had been committed
I by the soldiers.
ures of the voting on division and the
readers were left to guess whether or
not the Government had resigned. A
i wild rush was made for the House of
Commons and many elderly members
ran half a mile or more, while others
drove recklessly to Westminster.
Within the House of Commons itself
a strange scene was being enacted. An
unusually short list of questions had
brought on the business of the day
nearly half an hour ahead of the
usual time. Then .languidly the House
resolved itself Into a committee of
supply to'discuss the vote for Irish ed
ucation, which had already been de
i feated. Profound peace reigned and
i there was not a sign of the coming
' parliamentary storm except to the
few initiated, who keenly watched the
"whispered conference taking place be
tween the Irish whips. John Red
i mond made a complaint about the
! prohibition of Gaelic in the schools.
; but instead of a long speech, which
it would seem that he had prepared,
; judging by the volume of the notes in
his hand, the Irish leader said only a
few words. Wyndham replied with
equal brevity and it was evident he
was saving: himself for a string of pro
tests from the other Irish members.
SQLKMX SILEXCE.
The treasury bench was deserted,
save for the chief secretary for Ireland
and three cf his junior colleagues, and
barely twenty supporters of the Gov
ernment were in their places. Oppo
site was John Morley with Herbert
Gladstone and Richard Knight Caus
ton, the Liberal whips. These sat in
solemn silence on the front bench, with
a sprinkling of Liberals behind them.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the
leader of the Liberal party, was ab

No one rose to reply to Wyndham.
the Irish party for once utilizing silence
as its deadliest weapon. Redmond had
said there were to be no speeches and
though the rank and file of the Nation
alists did not know the reason, not
having been admitted to the secret
plan set on foot the previous evening
by their leader and their chief whip,
they obeyed implicitly. Discipline tri
umphed and not one word came from
the Irish members of the benches. The
Liberals, too, sat In silence, though
they were Ignorant of the projected
coup, and without a reply a division
was inevitable. Only then did Wynd
ham and the Government whips realize
how deliberately they had been out
witted.
John Redmond ,and Sir Thomas Es

through the House at 2:55. In desper

Social Di^ratch to The Ca'.l
LOS ANGELES. March 15. â For
nearly two weeks a well dressed man
who has proved himself to be an ex
pert thief has been robbing houses in
various sections of the city in " day
light, almost before the eyes of their
owners. He represents himself to be
a Deputy City Assessor and after tak
ing a list of the personal property in
th<s house he visits he has insisted
upon inspecting the premises. It is
during these trips of inspection that
he commits his thefts, which have
r.etted him several hundred dollars.
To-day he received an unexpected
reception at the house of Mrs. J. A.
Smith, Forty-third street and Central
avenue. When he called there Mrs.
Smith recojrnized him from his pub
lished description and refused to ad
mit him. He insisted and she told
him to wait a moment. Then she
went back ar.d secured a revolver and
when she returned to the door the
man tried to brush her aside and en
tor the house. Instantly she covered
him with her revolver and he started
â¢.Â» run. To accelerate his speed she
fired a shot at his heels. The shot
.-h roused the neighborhood, but the
thief escaped. At another place to
day the same man demanded $2 poll
tax from a man whom he found sick
in bed. and when he threatened to
Jevy upon tli* bed on which the man
was lying the money was paid. The
pol!c< have been unable to find him.
Social Dispatch to The Call
LOS ANGELES. March 15.â R. C.
Begrgs was sentenced by Superior
Judge Smith to two years in the
San Quentin Penitentiary to-day for
forgery, to which he pleaded guilty,
and although there were a dozen or
more other charges of forgery against
him they were dismissed. Beggs has
been in the penitentiary before. Sev
eral years aio, while he was secretary
of an Oakland street railway company,
he stole about 511,000 in cash one day
when the employes of the company
were about to be paid. With the as
sistance' of another man he got away
with the cash. /He was captured later
in the northern part of the State and
sentenced to nine years in San Quen
tan, but was \ pardoned by Governor
Markham. His partner in crime, who
was less guilty than he, served his full
sentence. Later Beggs was connected
with a Contra Costa laundry and was
driven out of one of the smaller towns
in that county. He came here about
a year ago and last December cashed
twenty or more forged checks and was
caught in the act of cashing one of
them.

TOOK A STRAW VOTE.
Interesting Experiment in a Restau- '
rant.
An advertising apent. representing a i
prominent New York magazine, while â¢
on a recent Western trip, was dining |
" one evening in a Pittsburg restaurant, j
While waiting for his order he i
glanced over his newspaper and no- I
'ticed the advertisement of a well- i
k:iou-n dyspepsia preparation, Stuart's j
Dyspepsia Tablets. As he himself ;
a regular user of the tablets, he began j
speculating as to how many of the
other tra.velin? men in the dining- \
room were also friends of the popular
remedy for indigestion.
He says: 1 counted twenty-three
men at the tables, and in the hotel of-
fice I took the trouble to interview ;
them and was surprised to learn that
nine of the twenty-three made a prac-
tice of taking one or two of Stuart's
. Dysi>epsia Tablets after each meal,
k One of them told me he had suf-
* fered so much from stomach trouble
that at one time he had been obliged
to quit the road, but since using
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets had been
entirely free from indigestion, but he
continued their use, especially while
traveling; on account of irregularly
of meals and because, like a.11 travel-
ing fnen, he was often obliged to eat
what he could get and not always
â¢what he wanted.
Another, who looked the Dicture of
health, said he never ate a meal with-
out taking a Stuart Tablet afterward
because he could eat what he pleased
and when he pleased without fear of
a sleepless r.ight or any other trouble.
Still another used them because he
was subject to gas on stomach, caus-
ing pressure on heart and lungs,
yhortnes3 of breath and distress in
rhest, which he no longer experienced
pine*? nsing the tablets regularly.
Another claimed that Stuart's Dys-
j "jjsia Tablets v.as the only safe
remedy he has ever found for sour
tomach and acidity. He had former-
ly i:sed common soda to relieve the
trouble, but the tablets were much
better and safer to use.
After smoking, drinking or other
excesses which weaken the digestive
organs, nothing restores the stomach
to a healthy, wholesome condition so
t-JTectually is Stuart's Tablets.
.Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain
she natural digestives, pepsin, dias-
Utw. which every weak stomach lacks,
as â¢well as nux. hydrastin and yellow
parilla. and can be safely relied on as
a radical cure for every form of poor
digestion. Sold by druggists every-
where.

Well-Known Citizens Testify That
Character of Railroad Official Is
Above Reproach.
The friends of K. A. White, assistant
superintendent of steamers of the
Southern Pacific Company, rallied to
the defense of his good name in Judge
Sloss* court yesterday and testified
that his reputation for truth, honesty
and integrity was of the very best.
The witnesses who testified to White's
good character were Jay Deming, who
said that during- the twelve years he
had known the railroad official he
never knew him to do a wrongful act;
Charles J. Wilder, assistant auditor of
the Southern Pacific, who said he had
known White for more than twenty
yoars and always found him upright;
Attorney Joseph E. Haven and Her
bert Kullman, the tanner. Both Kull
man and Haven were . positive that
White was a good citizen, an honest
man and a trustworthy one.
White is in court as defendant in a
suit to recover a sum approximating
$3500 brought against him by Fred A.
Boehm, administrator of the estate
of Daniel Boehm, who had the restau
rant privilege on the river steamers.
At Monday's hearing of the case a
number of railroad men with whom
White had had trouble testified that
his character was bad.
Compromise Damage Suits.
The suit of Hubert H. Bancroft and
the History Company against the Cen
tral Light and Power Company for
$7500 damages for injuries to the His
tory building and its contents, caused
by the explosion in the basement of
the building in July, 1901, have been
compromised, the plaintiffs receiving
$3000. The Bancroft suit, which? for
several days past has been on trial in
Judge Hunt's court, was dismissed yes
terday and an order dismissing the
History Company's action was filed
with the County Clerk.
TIENTSIN, March 15.â A foreigner
just arrived from Port Arthur reports
that a short engagement took place be
tween the Russian and Japanese fleets
on Sunday last, the .protected cruiser
Diana, belonging to the former, re
ceiving some injuries. About twenty
or thirty shells were exchanged.
The Imperial Chinese Railway Com
pany is considering the withdrawal of
its station force and all its movable
property from Newchwang.
The haste of the British and Ameri
can gunboats * to leave' Newchwang
while the intentions of the Japanese
are unknown, and while consular juris
diction and the full treaty port rights
of neutrals are unquestioned, thus pre
maturely abandoning the protection
heretofore maintained, has provoked
the indignation of residents and an of
ficial protest has been made to the
United States Government.
This was done especially in view of
the action of the Japanese in placing
their consulate and other property un
der British protection, their example
being imitated by the Russians, who,
as indicated in Drevious dispatches,
transferred their extensive bank, con
sular and civil administration proper
ties to the French, thereby rendering
Russian, Japanese and other interests
alike neutral. The protest was sent
also because the withdrawing of a Brit
ish gunboat and what is understood
as the American intention of with
drawal are regarded as palpable' neg
lect, inviting depredations upon British
and American Interests.'
The British Consul here has filed a
protest with Sir Ernest Satow, the
British Minister at Peking, against the
projected abandonment of the New
chwang end of the Chinese Railway by
its directors and the management in
Great Britain. The reasons given by
the Consul for his action are that the
British Government 'had previously
made known its intention of protecting
the road. and that its abandonment at
this time meant the probability of its
destruction by the Russians, should
they eventually be, forced to retreat.

"I venture to assure you that this
evidence of your moral sympathy, when
kmrwn in my country, will be received
with deepest gratitude. It will be con
sidered as a new page in the glorious
history of 123 years of American-Rus
sian friendship. Begun by Washington
and Catherine the Great, continued by
fl.ll their successors, this friendship had
one of its culminating points in the
â¢sixties of the nineteenth century, when
President Lincoln and Emperor Alex
ander II simultaneously hoisted the
standard of liberty, abolishing slavery
here and serfdom in Russia. 'Blood is
thicker than water,' and. the blood of
Lincoln and Alexander II has cemented
forever the traditional friendship be
tween America and Russia."
"We fervently hope that our friends,
â¢when they learn to know us better, will
a&ree that the Russian people are a
preat Christian nation. After religion
the most characteristic feature of Rus
sian life is the recognition of the noble
role of woman in the family, in society

"In your efforts to bring closer to

NOTED RUSSIANS
ARE THE GUESTS OF
NEW YORK WOMAN
WASHINGTON, March 15. â The
State Department has received formal
assurance from China that the Govern
ment of that country will insist upon
the observance, on the part of Chinese
subjects, of the strictest neutrality to
ward both sides during the present
war. This assurance Is in addition to
the formal notice of neutrality, al
ready generally proclaimed by China.
It is believed here that this last as
surance given to the United States will
be useful in finally allaying the appre
hensions expressed by Russia that
China would be led by Japanese suc
cesses into a breach of neutrality.
It was said to-night that the addi
tional assurance from China was in re
sponse to an inquiry from Conger, the
American Minister to Peking, who, un
der instructions from the State Depart
ment, asked the Chinese officials in a
general way about the significance of
the activity of the Chinese troops on
the Manchurian border. Russia, Ger
many and France have felt some un
easiness about the movements of these
troops, fearing that a junction with
the Japanese forces was contemplated.
This Government, however, has not
shared in the uneasiness, and the posi
tive character of the assurances that
China not only would observe, but
would maintain, the strictest neutrality
Ieads to the belief that the maneuvers
of her army is for the legitimate pur
pose of getting It into shape for put
ting down any disturbance that may
arise as a result of the war.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 15.â From
the highest quarter the press has In
formation that there is tio foundation
for the rumors from Tokio that the
Russians are abandoning Port Arthur.
"It is the veriest nonsense," said an
official informant. Â¦ "Nothing had oc
curred there to warrant such reports.
The Japanese fleet has not been seen
for forty-eight hours. The motive of
the Tokio Government in spreading
this story is probably to influence pub
lic feeling in Japan, for the purpose of
creating enthusiasm while a war loan
is being floated."
The newspapers here manifest the
greatest indignation over the report,
the Boerse Gazette characterizing it as
outrageous and a malicious invention.
Attention) is directed to the order of
the day by Lieutenant General Stoes
sel, commander at Port Arthur, in
which he declared that the place never
would be surrendered, as representing
the Russian position. Relative to this
point a military officer said:
."'This mere statement carries Ita own
refutation, unless we meant to beat an
ignoble retreat all along the line. If
we abandon Port Arthur we leave our
fleet there to be doomed. It Is too ab
surd to discuss."
+
The Emperor has received a long tel
egram from Vice Admiral Makaroff,
in command of the Russian squadron at
Port Arthur, giving details of the dam
age to the ships, as he found them on
his arrival at Port Arthur, and the les
sons taught therefrom. This dispatch
was the subject of earnest discussion
at the Winter- Palace to-day between
the Emperor and the Grand Duke
Alexis, the High Admiral, who took
luncheon with . Nicholas. They also
discussed the condition of the war
ships at Kronstadt and those building
there. It is understood the Emperor
will shortly make a personal inspec
tion of those ships.
The Emperor has declined with
thanks the offers of the German and
French Red Cross Societies to supply
contingents for service in the Far
East.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 15.â The
report from Newchwang that four Rus
sian steamships had been sunk at the
entrance to Port Arthur after the re
moval of the battleship Retvizan is
authoritatively denied here. With the
exception of the dispatch of yester
day from General Zilinsky, no official
telegrams containing news of fighting
have been received in the last forty
eight hours. Several telegrams relating
to the_Â»movements of troops have ar
rived, but as these were only of strate
gic Importance their contents was not
made public.
A copy of the Xovikrai of Port Ar
thur, dated February 19, which has
just reached here, de'finitely establishes
the fact that when the first torpedo
attack was made on Port Arthur it
was entirely unexpected. The Russian
squadron was anchored outside in three
iirws, with the 'battleships in the rear.
The captain of the battleship Cesare
vitch, from the bridge, could plainly
trace the course of the torpedo from
his ship. ..When It exploded under the
stern of the battleship, the latter heel
ed at first to starboard and then to
port, at an angle of eighteen degrees.
Two other torpedoes which were
launched missed the Cesarevitch, one
of them striking the protected cruiser
Pallada. The Cesarevitch, in the mean
time, was getting up steam and weigh
ing her anchor. She finally got under
way, steering with her engines, swung
around for the harbor, but failed to
make the entrance and ran aground.
The torpedo which struck the Cesare
vitch contained 200 pounds of pyroxy
gen.
Vice Admiral Togo is unwilling Â¦ to
run the risk of dividing his battleship
squadron and continues to operate the
six battleships together. If the Rus
sians should make an attempt Ur reach
Vladivostok it is believed they will try
a dash through the Korean Straits
rather "than, enter the. Japan Sea
through the Sugaru Straits.
TOKIO, March 15.â It is strongly be
lieved here that the Russian fleet aban
doned Port Arthur, after the fourth
attack was made upon it by the Jap
anese fleet, and is endeavoring to reach
Vladivostok. Confirmation of this
movement is not obtainable from any
reliable source, but recent scouting In
the vicinity of Port Arthur has failed
to reveal the presence of any warships.
It seems logical enough that the Rus
sians should attempt a dash for Vladi
vostok, where It is possible to dock
large ships, effect a junction with their
armored cruiser squadron and secure
a base for operations, while possessing
adequate land defenses. The hopeless
ness of continuing at Port Arthur is
manifest, while a dash for Vladivostok
might succeed, contrary to the opinion
previously expressed.
"I believe the ablest strategists of
all countries agree that if the Japan
ese respond to the Russian call to
come inland they will exhaust them
selves and became an easy prey for the
hosts of the Czar. They should defend
Korea, hold the seacoast and wait. If
Russia then chooses to fight she must
herself assume the burdens and risks
that distance always imposes upon mil
itary enterprises."
It is stated in Japanese circles that
the Mikado's military council has given
full consideration to the Ideas, here ad
vanced and that its decision will de
pend upon circumstances. .Should cli
matic or other difficulties retard the
Japanese advance until the Russians
occupy Manchuria in great force it is
regarded as likely that the Japanese
fleet and army will content themselves
with holding Korea and blocking Rus
sia's outlet to the sea.
"This extreme party is composed
mainly of men who in the Chino-Jap-.
anese. way, ' urged,, the Tokio authori
ties to push oh**to Peking and "dictate
tdrms of peace in the enemy's capital,
as the Germans did in Paris. They
forgot that Paris was the inevitable
German objective, for military as well
as political reasons, whereas the Jap
anese had no earthly military reason
for going to Peking. Happily the long
er heads in Tokio prevailed in 1895. It
is not too much to hope they will pre
vail in the present instance.
LONDON, March 15.â "If the views
of some of Great Britain's most emi
nent strategists obtain, Japan will com
pletely alter the ground plan of her
campaign and refuse to pursue the
Russians to Harbin and beyond," said
an experienced commander to-day.
"The long article by the Times* mili
tary critic in yesterday's paper," he
continued, "pointing out the vast risks
the Japanese would take by advancing
far inland, was inspired by British sol
diers of the highest rank. The Jap
anese war party is eager to- go the
whole length against the Russians and
wants not only to take Korea, reduce
Port Arthur and Vladivostok and domi
nate the entire northeast littoral of
China, but also to drive the Muscovites
out of Manchuria.

When seen at the Palace last evening.
Sands declined to be interviewed re
garding his experiences in the Orient,
pleading that he was preparing to keep
a theater engagement. Concerning the
war, however, he said that Korea would
be guided by Japan in internal and
foreign affairs, as agreed between the
two governments early in February,
when Japan assumed a protectorate
over the empire. Japan guarantees
protection to Korea in the matter of
her independence, her territorial Integ
rity and the sovereignty of her. ruler.
Sands admitted that he was going to
Washington on a private mission, the
character of which he declined to di
vulge.
According to the dispatch received In
Washington, Sands was entertaining a
number of friends and several officers
of a French cruiser at his official resi
dence when the documents disappeared.
Som,e ugly imputations were made and
were followed by Sands' resignation.
William l.. Sands, former adviser to
the King rf Korea . and whose name
was recently Involved in a scandal at
the court of Seoul that resulted In his
sudden retirement from his responsible
position, was a passenger on the trans
port Thomas, which arrived from the
Orient late Monday night.
Sands was formerly secretary of thÂ«
United States legation in Seoul, having
received his appointment from the late
President McKinley during the tetter's
first term. In 1899 he was selected by
the Emperor of Korea as his private
adviser and retained the position until
the early part of 1903, when the report
reached Washington that he had been
forced to resign and was preparing to
leave Korea for the United States. No
cause was given for Sands' hasty re
tirement and nothing more was heard
of the incident until the outbreak of
hostilities between Japan and Russia
in February, when a dispatch reached
here to the effect that his resignation
was due to the sudden disappearance
from his residence of a number of Im
portant Korean maps and data regard
ing the^llttle empire that would be very
valuable to either of the hostile forces.
PARIS. March 15. â The SL Peters
burg correspondent of the Echo de
Paris says that rumors to the effect
that the Vladivostok and Port Arthur
squadrons have been united are re
ceived with incredulity by the general
staff. The correspondent believes that
the rumors are probably due to Vice
â¢Admiral Makaroffs frequent sorties.
He says that General ZilJnsky is now
Viceroy AlexiefTs chief of staff and is
crlirx under his orders in succession
to Major General Pflug.
"There was an error in the trans
knission of my dispatch of March 11."
adds the correspondent, "which at
tributed to General Kuropatkin the
statement tliat he hoped to finish with
the Japanese before the end of July.
What *he really said was; 'I do not
know whether any great action will
occur before July, but I hope to finish
before the end of the year and leave
the field clear to the plenipotentiaries
intrusted with the drawing up of the
conditions of peace.' "
Official denial is made of the report
printed here this morning that ex
changes of views are now going on be
tween Paris, London and Washing
ton relative to offering mediation in
the Far Eastern war. The Foreign
office here is not aware of such an ex
change and considers that mediation
is impracticable, as neither party
would consider it.

Deposed Because of
Disappearance of

While there has been no break in the complete silence regarding the Japanese land operations, an incident has occurred which indicates that the brown men
are at last ready to strike a decisive blow. All war correspondents who were permitted to accompany the Japanese advance to Pingyang have been ordered to re
turn to Seoul. The only construction that can be put upon this unexpected action is that Japan is ready to put into operation the plans for her land campaign and
is taking every precaution to prevent information concerning her movements reachingthe enemy. ; ; >,f,'
From Tokio comes the startling announcement that the Japanese naval commanders believe that the Russian fleet has left the harbor of Port Arthur, probablv
to attempt a. dash to Vladivostok to join the four cruisers stationed there. Recent advices from Port Arthur have indicated that Vice Admiral Makaroff" intended
some sudden movement.. The Russian ships, following the last battle, remained outside the harbor continuously with steam up. As the Japanese seem cognizant of
the movements of the Russian fleet, it is altogether probable that they will be able to intercept Makaroff. in which event a desperate naval battle would occur. It is
denied from St. Petersburg that the Russian commander blocked the channel at Port Arthur after taking his ships outside; but if he intended to abandon the har
bor it. is altogether probable that he would have done something of the kind to assist the garrison in preventing the entrance of Japanese ships. St. Petersburg
again denounces the rumors that Port. Arthur is to be evacuated.*
The cruiser Cincinnati has arrived at Chemulpo with American refugees from the Urisan district. They were unmolested, although numerous bodies of
troops were encountered while they were traveling to the port of Chenampo. . â¢ \
British military experts have adopted the novel plan of advising Japan" on campaign methods through the medium of inspired articles in the press. It is sajd
that Tokio will heed their warning against being led into a pursuit of the Russians into Manchuria.
Â¦ Replying to an inquiry directed from Washington. China has given renewed assurance of her neutrality during the war. The movement of her troops
toward the frontier is for legitimate protection against invasion, and there is no intention in Peking of giving assistance to the Japanese.
Refugees irom Port Arthur arriving at Yinkow ridicule the reports that great 'damage was done by Japanese shells during the recent bombardment.
General Kuropatkin will reach Mukden on March 26. It is expected that Russian military operations will begin as soon as the commander-in-chief arrives
in 'Manchuria. He is going to the front with his plan of campaign already mapped out.

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
- I have changed my mind. Xot
Beethoven, but Schumann, is Harold
Bauer's alter ego. Last night, at the
pianist's last recital but one, he gave
the Schumann Fantasle in C. that
was absolutely the biggest piano-play
ing that has been heard here. Each
recital only further convinces of Mr.
Bauer's powers. He is a giant, a
thick forelock, if not a head, taller
than the rest, and in the fantasie the
pianist touched his highest peak of
achievement. His art is supremely in
tellectual, and its brilliant sanity, its
superb balance, its moving lyrical
quality, made a Schumann of a not
to-be-described beauty. There was the
Bach Italian concerto, a laughably
lovely rendering. There was a Chopin
group, with the C sharp etude that
followed as encore, taken at a tempo
not more than three times that of any
one else â yet limpidity itself â a stu
pendous performance.
So also the Alkan study in unison.
In which for a moment Mr. Bauer
became the virtuoso for virtuosity's
sake. His pyrotechnics are just as
magnificent as his poetry, and both
the best the years are likely to bring
us for long.

VIENNA, March 15.â German-Czech
race hatred led to a serious riot at
Ling, the capital of East Austria, to
day, when a mob of infuriated Ger
mans In revenge for the ill treatment
of their compatriots at Prague, storm
ed the hall in which Jan Kubelik, the
Bohemian violinist, was giving a con
cert, compelling Kubelik to seek safety
in flight. Before the doors were open
ed the mob attacked the carriage of
the /District Governor, Count Wicken
burg, with stones. The police had dif
ficulty in protecting the Count from
personal injury.
The mob then forced the police cor
don, invaded the hall, smashed the
mirrors and threw missiles at,Kut>elik.
The concert was then stopped and the
audience dispersed amid a fire of of
fensive epithets. The demonstrations
were continued outside the hotel where
Kubelik was staying and the police had
some difficulty in dispersing the mob.
The question for us to hammer out during thÂ«

The strength and activity of Erie

story of a new holding company to
take over the Northern Pacific. The
story was pronounced absurd by repre
sentatives of the Northern Securities
Company.
Later Hill gave out the following:
"U^til the full official copies of the
opinions and decree of the Supreme
Court have been received and our at
torneys have had an opportunity to
advise us as to our course of pro
cedure, the officers of the company can
make no further announcement than
to declare their purpose to promptly
and fully follow the law as now in
terpreted."
Hill visited J. P. Morgan in the
afternoon and the two conferred for
some time. Both declined to be inter
viewed, but Hill stated that there wa3
nothing new in the general situation.
In regard to the report that the
Northern Securities Company of Can
ada was to be the successor of the
Northern Securities Company of the
United States, President Hill was
quoted to-day as saying:
"We have as much notion of incor
porating a company in Mars or the
moon as in Canada. We intend to con
form to the law."
The Northern Securities Company of
Canada was granted a charter in 1902.
Its powers are very large and include
the right to buy, control and operate

OTTAWA. Ontario, March 15. â The

Spooner and Foraker took the posi
tion that on account of the outlying
position of Hawaii the United States
should be prompt in providing for its
protection and Perkins said he was
willing: if a sum sufficient to accom
plish the purpose sought could be se
cured. In accordance with Perkins'
suggestion Spooner offered an amend
ment appropriating $526,100 instead
of $200,000. This amendment was ac
cepted without division.
By common consent the Senate re
sumed 'consideration of the torpedo
boat amendment and Gallinger offered
a substitute providing for competition
in securing a vessel of the type desired.
The amendment was defeated â 17
to 36.
The fortifications bill, as amended,
was then passed and the Senate went
into executive session.
In response to a request from Sena
tor Lodge, Senator Perkins explained
the reasons which actuated the com
mittee in striking out the House; pro
vision of the bill appropriating $200,
000 for the purchase of sites for de
fenses in the Hawaiian Islands, say
ing the committee's action was due to
the fact that the Government had no
option on the land for this purpose
and that therefore it might have the
effect of placing the Government at
the mercy of real estate owners. He
also said the amount named was not
sufficient.
WASHINGTON, March 15. â The

The different claims upon his numer

his family, which sent drafts to cover
the accounts as soon as they learned
of his Â¦:::'. culties. He does not owe
Uncle Sam anything, but the passage

FAMILY SETTLES CLAIMS.
It has been found that the shallow
drains used in some places do not pre
vent the rise of the alkali to the sur
face. Instead of two and three feet
deep, the drains should be five and
seven feet deep. These drains will be
most effective when laid one-half mile
apart in east and west parallel lines,
as they may thus be accessible to the
owners of land on either side. The
surplus water that drains into them,
it is found, may be used again for ir
rigation purposes, instead of being al
lowed to run to waste.
According to the estimates, the cost
of a proper system of drainage for the
district will be about 5260,000.
During the investigation the Irriga
tion experts examined some 300 square
miles of land, the design being to se
cure data upon which to predicate
plans for draining off the surplus un
derground water.
Reports from the irrigation experts
of the Department of Agriculture and
the University of California upon the
drainage systems necessary to save the
vineyard and orchard lands in the
vicinity of Fresno have so far matured
that actual work- on the systems may
now go forward at any time. These
reports arÂ« embodied in a bulletin writ
ten by C. G. Elliott, agent and expert
on Irrigation Investigation, which was
issued at the university to-day.
The experts found from the start that
they would have to contend with the
alkali, which the abundanoe of water
dissolves from the soil in the vicinity of
Fresno and by the process of evapora
tion concentrates at the surface. Not
alone is this alkali Injurious to or
chards and vineyards, but so is the
excess of -water that fills the soil. The
evil has been growing so that it threat
ens to end In the final destruction of
thousands of acres of producing land.

|^ . Greatest In the World m SNEW YORK, March 15. â Gold to the amount
of $1,753,000 was received at the sub-treasury
by transfer from San Francisco to-day.
Tills is the last of the $3,000,000 Japanese gold
recently received from Japan. The metal will
be transhipped to London.
Every town in Mexico has a public
bathhouse.
Port Arthur and Cincinnati are in the
same latitude.
Dr. T. W. Stone of Stockton has been
summoned as a witness for the State
in the case. It is said that his testi
mony will be very detrimental to the
case of the accused. Mrs. Botkin lived
in Stockton with her husband in 1898.
While she was ill on July 28 of that
year, Dr. Stone was called in. When
her condition had improved she con
versed at length with him, asking him
in detailall about arsenic. He thought
she was joking, and told her to \:se
morphine if she was going to commit
suicide, whereupon she remarked that
she did not intend to use any drug on
herself.
She asked If too * much would not
cause vomiting and tnus not poison the
person taking it. She went to San Fran
cisco a few days afterward and re
turned on August 18, and Dr. Stone
was called in again. She was suffer
ing from hysterics.
Shortly afterward a woman who had
been sent here as a private detective
called on Dr. Stone and asked him
what illness troubled Mrs. Botkin. Tha
doctor replied that it was hysterics,
not wishing -to make a confidant of the
detective. He kept his own .counsel
about Mrs. Botkin questioning, him in
regard to - arsenic poisoning. It. was
not until after she was convicted that
he spoke freely about it.
The Eastern witnesses on behalf of
the prosecution will arrive to-morrow
night over the Santa Fe. It will prob
ably be nearly midnight before they
reach the city. With them will come
John P. Dunning and his little daugh
ter. Originally, he intended to be here
at the opening of the trial, but business
reasons compelled him to delay and he
joined the other witnesses at Philadel
phia and proceeded westward in their
company. He is the husband of the
murdered woman and the alleged mo
tive of the crime was jealousy on the
part of Mrs. Botkin. The daughter is
now eleven years old! At the first trial
she was not present to testify. She
partook of some of the poisoned candy
and her condition was so precarious
that she was unable to 'travel when
Mrs. Botkin was first convicted of the
murder.

TACOMA, March 15.â Efforts to es
tablish a Mormon church at La Grande
and Pendleton, Or., are being offset by
a series of vigorous revival meetings
now being held there by Evangelist S.
M. Martin of St. Louis. Meetings are
being held in the Christian church and
nearly 200 converts have been secured
at Pendleton alone. The Protestant
churches are working together to coun
teract the Mormcn movement. The
Mormons are pushing the work at La
Grande on the finest tabernacle yet
constructed in the Northwest. It will
cost $40,000, including a fine pipe organ.
Over a hundred men are at work, a
large number of whom are Mormons,
who contribute their work without pay.
Another tr.bernacle is proposed for
Pendleton and several are to be con
structed in Idaho, where the Mormons
have already gained a strong foothold.
Evangelical church circles are becom
ing somewhat alarmed oVer the vigor
of the Mormon movement throughout
the Northwest. Churches have been
established in Puget Sound cities, in
cluding Tacoma, and a number of
priests and exhorters secure new con
verts weekly. Polygamy Is not openly
advocated by Mormon adherents in the
Northwest.
Special Di*i>atch to The Call
At the time the cattle were unloaded
nine of them were killed by a passing
train and one heifer was left at a near
by, ranch in payment' of damages by
the stockmen. Dr. Kenon found the
hides of the dead cattle Â«hd this
heifer to be infected with the Texas
fever tick. Dr. Charles H. Blemer, the
State Veterinary Surgeon, was commu
nicated with and arrived in Napa this
evening. To-morrow he and Benjamin
will proceed to the Ink ranch and fur
ther investigate the case.
NAPA, March 15. â Five hundred cat
tle were -recently shipped from Mon
terey County to Napa County, and a
number of them have been found to be
afflicted with the dread Texas fever.
The cattle arrived at Rutherford two
weeks ago and were driven from there
to the Ink ranch, in Pope Valley. Com
plaints have come to the District At
torney of this county from time to time
from farnYers in the vicinity of the Ink
ranch concerning the cattle, and as a
result District Attorney Benjamin has
been conducting an investigation with
Dr. T. C. Kenon. veterinary surgeon.

REDDING, March 15. â As the Ore
gon Express, due at San Francisco
this morning, was running at the rate
of forty-five miles an hour past a point
thirteen miles south of here at mid
night the engineer and fireman both
saw that they were bearing down upon
a washout, three rail lengths being
without ties. The unsupported rails
were not seen until the pilot was al
most upon them. The engine crew
applied the brakes and waited for the
catastrophe they felt sure would hap
pen. Wonderfully enough the entire
train, with the exception of the last
Pullman, passed successfully over the
washed out stretch of track before the
train could be brought to a stop. The
last car stopped on the unsupported
rail and toppled over. Xo one was
hurt. The passengers in the derailed
car were transferred to other cars and
the train proceeded.

SCHOONER ANTELOPE
ARRIVES SAFE IN PORT
Kapea may have left here on a for
eign-bound steamer or a steamer for
the other islands if he has not. as he
threatened, taken his life with his own
hands.
The young man has not been seen
for several days. Yesterday there was
found in his desk at the office the fol
lowing note addressed to a friend:
"I have done wrong in my life, and
it is better for me to go in the woods
and shoot myself, and I will do it. I
am no good at all after I made some
big blunder which I ought not to do.
Give my aloha nui to the boy and my
family. Do anything with my stuff.
"H. KAPEA."
HONOLULU, March 8.â Edward Viv
ian Richardson, cashier and. book
keeper in the Territorial Water Works
Department, who was arrested to-day
on a charge of embezzlement, Is said
to have made a confession to his su
perior officers. It is alleged that the
Auditor's department, which is exam
ining the books of his office, has al
ready discovered a shortage of $1800.
Richardson Is a half white Hawaiian.
He has held his position for several
years. The cause of his downfall is
attributed gambling. He is known
to have visited his office one night to
take money from th.e safe, the money
being used to make good his losses In a
downtown saloon a few hours pre
viously. He is now out on bail.
Another case of defalcation brought
to light to-day is that of Henry Kapea,
who was a young and trusted employe
of the Hawaiian Trust Company, of
which Governor Carter was manager
prior to his acceptance of his present
Federal office. Kapea had the handling
of monÂ»y for the company, and is said
to have made away with $100 collected
from a Chinese tenant of John Ena,
for whom the trust company was at
torney-in-fact. To J. R. Gait, man
ager, he confessed that he had spent
the money.
Special Correspondence of The Call,
ATTENDANCE IS SM!ALL.
The courtroom was only fairly well
"There." said Knight, "this man
would not make a fit juror, and the
District Attorney knew it, but he pass
ed him. He wants a man on the jury
who acknowledged that he was unable
to decide Impartially."
"I want nobody on the jury who is
r.ot impartial," retorted Byington,
hotly.
"There is no challenge," said Judge
Cook- (
"We challenge," said Knight, "if the
District Attorney will not."
"Xo objection," said Byington, and
the talesman withdrejv.
When the last man had been exam
ined and there still remained three
seats to be filled satisfactorily in the
jury box. Judge Cook ordered a second
special venire of sixty to be issued,
returnable In court at 10 o'clock this
morning. From these it is expected
that the panel will be completed.
The selection of Jurors proceeded
much more rapidly yesterday than the
day before. The defense exhausted
only three peremptory challenges, mak
ing fourteen in all and leaving six
still available, while the prosecution
used up only one. Out of thirty-one
talesmen examined four were found
who answered all interrogatories satis
factorily and were enrolled as jurors.
The same general line of questioning
was folio-wed by District Attorney By
ington and Attorney Knight as on the
day previous.
John E. Doak. for whom an attach
ment had issued Monday because he
failed to answer his name, was purged
of contempt. It was shown that the
name as drawn from the box was John
K. Dock and in the subpena the name
had been omitted altogether. He also
escaped duty on the jury because he
had an unalterable opinion in the case.
Mrs. Botkin sat with her sister as
before and held the latter's hand dur
ing a great part of the proceedings.
She was perceptibly more nervous than
on Monday and it is evident that the
skrain is beginning to tell upon her.
Once she prompted Attorney Knight
to ask a talesman whether or not he
had conversed with one of the wit
nesses in the case. He said that he
had not done so knowingly, but he re
ceived his conge by a peremptory chal
lenge from the defense.
Knight and Byington had a slight
clash over one of the last talesmen
railed. The District Attorney passed
him for cause, and Knight then asked
him if he had not previously told the
District Attorney that he could not act
impartially as a juror in the case. The
talesman said he had.
Nine Jurors in all have been secured
to try Mrs. Cordelia Botkin for the
murder of Mrs. Elizabeth Dunning.
The ninth man was accepted by both
prosecution and defense yesterday,
shortly before noon, and then the reg
ular panel and the special venire were
exhausted. So far as selected the Jury
consists of the following:
William S. McDevitt. an employe of the
United Railroads, residing; at 402^
second street.
Vernon Cpton, a printer, residing: at 205
Central avenue.
Jacob Goetjen, a grocer of 249 Fifth itreet,
reridir.c at 5 Waller street.
Julius L.lllenthal. formerly a jrrocer, resid
ing at ."507 FVlton street.
Morris Hymaji, a real estate dealer at 200
Sansome street, who resides at 2230 Sacra
mento street.
James II. Robertson, an Insurance man of
21Â«J Sanscme street, residing at 603 Capp street.
Ferdinand Balz. train merchant of 214 Pine
street, residing at 1630 Haicht street.
Henry Peters, ffrocer at 708 Beale street,
reuldlrg: at 875 Broderick street.
Bernard F. Wambold, retired grocer, residing
at 732 Ivy avenue.
In order to secure these nine there
have been 132 names called. Less than
twenty failed to answer their names,
they having been excused from ' the
regular panel for various reasons. The
remainder were either found to be dis
qualified for various reasons or were
peremptorily challenged by the prose
cution or defense.
SPKCIAIi VENIRE ISSUED.
EUREKA. March 15.â The present
*:orm is the severest that has visited
Humboldt County for years and shows
nÂ» sign erf abatement. It has been rain
ing incessantly since the 2d of Feb
ruary, during â¢which month there was
a precipitation of over 16 Inches. In
the Eel River Valley, the dairy section
and the most fertile part of the county,
the loss has been particularly severe.
A great many acres of these rich bot
tom lands are covered with sediment,
rendering them valueless for the pur
peses for which they have been used.
Many at tht dairymen have sold their
h^rds and will engage In other occu
pations. Eel River has also cut away
rr.uch valuable land, the Pleasant Point
section being badly affected.
The stock on the ranges and sheep
are suffering: from the continued stormy
spell and stockmen generally will suf
fer heavy losses.
The San Francisco and Northwest
ern Railroad, owned by the Santa Fe,
1* blocked by heavy slides and it will
be a week before the road is open to
traffic betwr/en this city and Scotia.
At present the trains run as far as
Alton and the mail is taken from that
point to Scotia by horseback.
The roads in the county are almost
impassable by reason of slides. The
Van Duzen River bridge promises to
be a total loss. The river is cutting
to one side cf it, and if the process
tontinues the structure will be in the
center of a gravel bed when the waters
recede and the river will be on one
tide, cutting off all approach. The
bridge is a costly structure.
The bridges over the smaller streams
of the county have nearly all been
cashed away and the county will be
put to considerable expense to replace
them.

- needed changes in the public land laws has re
ported very closely in line with the sound action of
the Ogden Irrigation Congress. The timber and stone
act has been the instrument of fraud from the beginning
and is to be substituted by a law authorizing the sale of
timber, under suitable regulations, retaining the title to
the land, and also for the sale of stone that is needed for
building or other economic purposes.
Assignment of desert entries will be stopped, and the
commutation of" homestead entries within forest reserves
or where timber is the chief value of the land will be re
stricted. Homestead entries of agricultural land within
forest reserves will be permitted. -The law ought to go
further, by permitting the use in forest reserves and na
tional parks of such natural resources as hydraulic power.
A considerable, mining section of California is now, and
has long been, suffering: from. the denial of such use, even
when th/e hydraulic power has long been in private own

use injures nothing, impairs no'scenery and endangers no

The more of such music the student
hears the better It will be for him, both
now and In the future. Undoubtedly,
a child will get more fun out of a
comic opera than out of Sembrich's
singing, and if be can be made to {un
derstand that it is to be regarded mere
ly as fun, and not as real music, far be
it from me to prevent his going to
hear it for I acknowledge willingly
that, in the way of Bpectacular per
formance, comic opera never reached
best to sing It in the flat, dry, throaty,
1 alky voice that the actress or actor
sang it in. If he (the boy) can be
brought to regard this \yzy of singing
as an eccentricity, and not as some
thing to be imitated, he may listen to
any amount of comic opera without
!>eing harmed thereby, but the question
is, can he be made to see these things
in their proper light? I am afraid not.
so I strongly advise taking him to con
Â«erts insteadâ good concerts, .where
great artists like BJspham,, Sembrich,
.Schumann-Heink, aud bo on sing.
Hearing such music as true artists
sing, to say nothing of the way they
sing it, is a liberal education to any
one.

Tax on Jezvcls.
A large bunch of trouble, social and
otherwise, Is in readiness for the Con
gressman who attempts to enact into
law a bill taxing jewelry in Washing
ton. Wealthy Washington women, pre
eminent in the social life of the na
tional capital, are agitated over the
measure, which was drafted and intro
duced by the District Commissioners,
and which aims to reach valuable per
sonal property now untaxed, being
classed as. heirlooms. The bill takes
jewelry out of that class. There 13
hardly a social function nowadays
where the bill is not discussed with
great anxiety and some bitterness by

AT a joint conference of the Federal, State and city
health officers it was decided to declare uncom
promising war upon Chinatown rats. It was
agreed that the dwellings in the congested Mongolian
quarters should be made "rat proof" by the use of ce
ment in cellars.and underground substories, so that the
disease infested rodent cannot make his way from build
ing to building through the easy passages offered by
rotten wooden partitions. Though the joint board real
izes that it will be impossible to enforce a wholesale con
version of cellar construction in Chinatown, it is the
spirit of their ruling that any new structures should be
provided with concrete flooring in the basement and that
a board of inspection may order such change in existing
buildings if deemed advisable.
This determination upon the part of our health au
thorities is a step in the right direction. It needs not the
confirmation of specialists to convince the thinking man
that the rat, scavenger though he may be, is also en
dowed with power of disseminating contagious disease
above any of his fellows in the animal kingdom. Ex
periments in some of the densely populated cities of
Germany a#id France have shown that this indiscrimi
nating gormand of the sewer and the cellar has probably
played a more active part in recent epidemics of typhus
and allied contagious maladies than, any other single
agent. To put an end to the evil a toxic virus has been
inoculated into a few rats, so that they might infect
others with it. thus fighting fire with fire.
Until this method of rat destruction can be perfected
and freed of any possibilities dangerous to humankind,
the plan which the joint conference, of health officers
have decided upon is^the only feasible one for the sup
pression of the growing army of rats. Certainly it will
be fjreatly to the public benefit if we can keep our
Chinatown rats under curb as the health officials have
Rich Watermelons.

RATS AND DISEASE.
The Carnavalet museum in Paris will
shortly receive an interesting addition
to its curiosities. The cradle of the
Prince Imperial has been offered to the
museum by M. Pietri. It is probably
the most ornate cradle in existence.
The city of Paris offered it as a gift
to the Empress on the birth of the
"Little Prince" in 1836. The cradle is
profusely decorated. At the back ia the
escutcheon of Paris, in enamel, on a
gold shield, and the sides are covered
with shields and medallions In enamel,
designed by Flandrin. The design of
the cradle was the work of Baltard.
In 1856, when it was presented to the
Empress Eugenie, Its cost was put at
more than 532.000. It was much in the
public eye three years ago when it was
6a exhibition at the Petit Palais. Then
the desire was expressed that it might
become the property of the nation.
That wish has now been realized.â

PHONOGRAPHâ D. M., Woodside.
Cal. In 1807 Thomas Young, M. D.,
pointed out a way by which a tuning
fork might be made to record Its own
vibrations. From that time on numer
ous attempts were made to perfect
sound-producing machines, but it was
not until 1357 that there was a practical
result of the idea of Dr. Young. And
It was not until 1877 that Thomas Edi-
Ron presented the phonograph as an in
strument for reproducing the human
voice. Since that date the inventor has
greatly Improved the original and oth
ers have produced the gramophone and
the graphophone, which differ from the
Edison machine in this, that they use
vulcanized rubber disks instead of wax
cylinders.
BIRD FOODâ Subscriber. Oakland,
Cal. German paste, a bird food for
larks, thrushes, nightingales and other
singing birds, especially those which in
their wild state feed chiefly upon In
sects, is composed of the following ma
terials: To two pounds of pea meal
add one-half pound of sweet almonds
which have been blanched, one-quarter
pound of fresh butter or . lard, five
ounces of moist sugar, one-half dram
of hay saffron and three eggs boiled
hard. This 13 beaten into a smooth
paste with water to give the consist
ency required for granulating through
a colander. The granulated paste is
then exposed to the air in a warm
place until it is quite hard and dry. If
properly prepared and dried It will keep
good in a dry place for a year or more.
There is one slight point which a
choirmaster might omit to mention, and
which I think it advisable to speak of
here, as it applies to all students of
singing, whether they happen to be
choristers or not. It is this: In sing
ing the boy must t>e careful how he
holds his sheet of music. In the first
place, if the paper is held too closely
to him it will tend to interfere more
or less with t!.e tone, not only because
it Is an obstruction, but because in
order to so hold it the singer must of
necessity cramp his chest and limit for
the time being the power of the lungs
for expansion. When holding the mu
eic too closely the boy will unconscious
ly drop his chin (as he lowers his head
to bring his eyes on a level with the
music) and thus throw the whole vocal
apparatus out of poise. This may seem
ja small point, but It is only too often
the means of curtailing or muffling
! sound, thus interfering strongly with
the faithful rendition of the song and
the beauty of the music rendered.
The pupil. who plays his own accom
paniments is even more liable to pre
vent people from getting. the full bene
fit of his singing, for In his eagerness
to play the accompaniment well he is
apt to lean forward toward the music
rack, thus throwing his chest out of
poise in another and quite as unde
sirable way as does the pupil who in
standing covers his face with his'mu
6lc.
A good rule to observe Is never to
stand or sit in such a way as to Inter
fere at all with the free play' of the
lungs. If sitting at the piano be sure
that the stool is at the right height,
be careful to have the pupil keep an
erect position, and," most Important of
mil, be sure that there is light enough
to see the notes perfectly- without
straining his eyes.
with ordinary choral singing at all. Of
the latter I do npt approve, except in
a case where one has already a trained
voice and knows enough to hold his
own, whether "his neighbor is singing
off. the key or not. In a large mixed
chorus of promiscuous voices there are
always a certain number of people who
sing a little off pitch, and one is liable
to be placed next to one of these peo
ple and to be influenced by his voice
without knowing it. If the chorus is
a large one the directory cannot poa
sibly weed out every voice that is not
quite true, for the trouble may be too
Blight to be detected against all the
volume of tone, and yet be of .enough
power to tend to drag down the voice
next it. *'~*M

Answers to Queries.
Wolf von Schlerbrand, Ph. D., author
of "The Kaiser's Speeches," and a well
known observer of international affairs,
tells in the current Harper's Weekly
some interesting facts about the Rus
sian peasants, who are considered to
be one of the mainstays of Russia in
time of war. The Russian peasants,
who number about 100,000,000, are, ac
cording to Von Schierbrand, slowly
starving to death. Their average earn
ings in the central provinces are only
8 or 9 cents a day throughout the year.
During the busiest harvest time they
rise to 13 or 16 cents a day, but through
out the winter they earn nothing.
Their diet consists of meal, flour and
grits, cabbage and potatoesâ no meat,
excepting three times a year. Their
food is less than that enjoyed by the
peasant class of any civilized country.
They live in hovels two and a half
yards long and one end a half yards
high, which harbor the entire family
and whatever cattle they possess. Is
it any wonder, asks Von Schierbrand,
that the Russian peasant has degen
erated, morally and physically?

I bring this subject up in the les
son to-day because every child that
hears music at all !s liable to go io
hear comic opera, and there is much
that might be harmful to him music
ally in almost any opera of to-day. I
mean by this not only that the music
itself is not, as a rule, anything that
is good enough for him to listen to
or to giiiri ideals from, but the way it
is Eung is something no child should
be allowed to consider as real music.
There is a certain unhappy medium
between singing and talking, which
'is largely employed by solo singers in
comic opera at the prerent time. It is
borrowed directly from the vaudeville
stage, and one can only hope that it
will soon be relegated to the place
from which it came, there to stay.
The stvle of so-called singing to
which I allude is "catchy." undoubted
ly, but therein lies its danger, for if
our pupil goes to hear light opera and
finds there some coon song sung in the
way which I have described he will, in
all probability, wish you to buy the
song for him. and will try his very
., â v
tonction and "ragtime" flavor about
them that there :s not much room left
lor melody. Even the real "comic
opera" seems to be a thing of the past;
and in the mdiet of the so-called comic
operas of the day (which have evolved
into nothing more or less than col
lections of vaudeville-like songs,
strung together without any apparent
connection with the feeble and hardly
to-be-discovered plot of the opera),
one looks for the good old days of
"Robin Hood." "Mikado,"' "Patience,"
"Pinafore." and so so.

Begum of Bhopal, of whose travels and
doings we are hearing a good deal just
now, is one of the most remarkable
women in India. She rules nearly a
million subjects, spread 'over an area
of nearly 7000 square miles; maintains
a force of nearly a thousand cavalry,
twice as many infantry and seventy
guns. Bhopal is remarkable from the
fact that it not infrequently produces
women who make better rulers than
the men. This has happened several
times since the reign of the famous
Dost Muhammad Khan, founder of the
Bhopal dynasty. Upon the death of
the hereditary Prince his widow, if she
survive him, takes his place at the
head of the state. Furthermore, the
widow of the heir apparent may, at
the death of the ruler, succeed.

At this time it is of interest to note some of the re
sources of Plumas as they are enumerated. Fifty per
cent of its agricultural lands are virgin soil, the lack of
transportation alone having caused them to remain un
cultivated. These, are, rich, have abundant water and
promise magnitude to the farming and dairying enter
prises of the future. W.hcn it becomes possible, as the
Independent truly says, to get. low transportation rates
on mining machinery to Plumas the rich deposits of min
erals need not go begging for owners. There is an im
mense amount of good timber in the county that remains
in the forest because of the absence of a railway to move
the harvested product. Grazing lands hold out a green
invitation to large herds of cattle to grow fat on luscious
grasses. Superb scenery abounds. The great Plumas
valleys are known at least by name to thousands of
Californians who have ne-er viewed them. Their beau
ties will be better appreciated when they can be more
easily seen.
The railway that is supposed to be near construction in
Plumas County will, if the line of its present survey be
followed, run through Sierra, ' Mohawk and American
valleys, Qass within three mile- of Quincy and then
through the great depression that forms the immediate
watershed of the north fork of the Feather River. It
will be the policy of the railway to build up the county.
In return Plumas is amply able to furnish a large
freighting business to the railway, the volume of which
must increase in proportion to the amount of encourage
ment given to local development. In its semi-centennial
year Plumas County has a fine outlook, and this will tend
to make such celebration of the creation of the county
as may take place the more enjoyable.
NEXT month will bring the fiftieth anniversary of
â¢ the organization of the county of Plumas. The
precise date is not on record.- The necessary
steps to make Plumas into a county were taken in
April, 1854. Two of the three Commissioners who were
named in the legislative act of March 18, 1854, are still
living. These are W. S. Dean and ].' W. Thompson.
Plumas was carved from the area of Butte County.
Prior to that, the residents of what is now Plumas County
were subjected to great inconvenience by compulsory
travel to obey court summons in Butte. Since then Plumas
has made. progress. Its climate is evidently favorable to
longevity, for the survival of two of its founders out
of three attests to that fact. Other conditions have also
been proven to be agreeable by the circumstance that the
two surviving Commissioners still claim Plumas as their
home.
In the half century that has elapsed since Commission
ers W. S. Dean, H. J. Bradley and J. W. Thompson first
met to carry out the purpose for which they were rramed
by the Legislature Plumas has patiently awaited the
opening up of its great natural resources to the world.
It is rich in minerals and agricultural possibilities.
Greater attention is now directed to them than at any
time in the history of Plumas. In its semi-centennial
year the conditions .are full of promise for the moun
tain county. In calling attention to the signs of the
times the Plumas Independent is active. The probabil
ity that a transcontinental road . will be. constructed
through the county inspires the hope of a great awaken
ing in the near future.

Maeterlinck has invited criticism by announcing that
patriotism is a barrier to freedom and harmful to the
highest ideals of any people. Why is it that people will
insist upon pronouncing judgments in a field in which
they know nothing? As Maeterlinck is not a patriot,
he should be satisfied with the profitable glory of being
a good playmaker.
While no one would be justified in ascribing conscious
motives to any member of the court, it is not without
significance that the three Democratic members, Chief
Justice Fuller and Justices White and Peckham, dissent
from the majority opinion and justify the contentions of
Messrs. Hill and Morgan thft the merger is merely an
exercise of property and personal freedom.
This partisan alignment of the court will have its ef
fect on politic?. The capital which seeks profit 'and ad
vantage in enormous combination will naturally seek
to elect a Democratic President in order to be rca'dy for
the next two vacancies on the bench. The dissenting
opinions show that there is such a thing as a partisan
view of the law based upon party methods of construing
the constitution. The Democratic view, uttered by the
three Democrats in the court, is against the power of
Congress to enact such legislation as the majority
opinion enforces against the merger. .
This is the background to the antics of the remarkable
Mr. William Randolph Hearst, who informs the country
that he is in effect the court below and has been affirmed.
The discussion of the points presented by the trust
attorneys is very interesting, for it involves the old issue
of State. rights and the efficacy of State corporations.
The arguments for the merger made all the points that
have become familiar through publication in the New
York Sun and the other newspapers owned by the trusts.
We do not use the term "owned" in its usually offensive
sense, implying false pretenses and private subsidies.
The trust publications are the property of the trusts
and used by them to get their side before the public,
which is perfectly legitimate.
As it has been insisted in these newspapers, and was
repeated in the arguments, that ruin would follow such
application of the power of Congress as the decision de
clares may be made, Justice Harlan says: "It is the
history of monopolies in this country and England that
predictions of ruin are habitually made by them when it
is attempted by legislation to restrain their operations
and protect the public against their exactions. In this,
as in former cases, they seek shelter behind the reserved
rights of the States and the constitutional guaranty of
liberty of contract. But this court has heretofore ad
judged that the act of Congress did not touch the rights
of States and that liberty of contract did not involve the
right to deprive^the people of free competition in trade
and commerce. But even if the court shared the gloomy
forebodings in which the defendants indulge it could not
refuse to respect the action of the legislative branch of
the Government, if what it has done is within the limits
of its constitutional power."
Congress having the constitutional power to enact the
anti-trust and interstate commerce laws the courts must
execute those laws, and if their enforcement be injurious
to the people they* have their recourse in the election of
a Congress that will repeal the laws.
It will be remembered that J. J. Hill of the Great
Northern, who, next to J. Pierpont Morgan, was the
greatest factor in the merger, said that he would see to
it that no increase in .rates resulted from merging the
Great Northern and the" Northern Pacific. That declara
tion was an incautious admission that combining the, two
roads, which traverse and serve the same territory, car
ried with it the power to put up rates, because it de
stroyed competition. Mr. Hill has very expert legal ad
visers, and no doubt they advised him that an action
could lie only against an overt act, and that as long as
rates were not raised the merger. could not be impeached.
The court decides that unrestrained trade is the right of
the people and that the power to restrain it, though not
in present use, is so dangerous that the courts may de
stroy it, and that action lies without waiting for an overt
act.
The statement of the case by Mr. Justice Harlan is so
clear. that the lay reader decides it at once without .read
ing forward to the conclusions of law. Going back to the
court's decision on the interstate commerce : act the
Justice says: "Congress has the power to establish rules
by which interstate and international commerce shall be
governed, and by the anti-trust act has prescribed the
rule of free competition among those engaged in such
commerce. The natural effect of competition is to in
crease commerce, and an agreement whose direct effect
is to prevent the play of competition restrains instead
of promotes trade and commerce."
The court's decision is the most important interpreta
tion of the anti-trust law and of the power of the Feder
al Government over commerce between the States that
has been delivered. It declares that the act is not lim
ited to merely unreasonable restraint of trade, but is di
rected against all restraint, reasonable or unreasonable.
This means that the enjoinable act is- the power to re
strain trade, whether it is used or not.
THE case against the Northern Securities Company,
known as the railroad merger case, was brought by
order of the President under the anti-trust law.
This act of the President brought upon him the enduring
wrath of combined capital, and started that campaign
which it was hoped would defeat him for the nomination.
The trust organs have found an echo in every faction of
tne Democracy. The New York Sun shouts that "Roose
velt is unsafe," and the echo "unsafe" comes back from
Olney, Gorman, Hearst and Bryan. As the Supreme
Court has indorsed the position of the President, it ap
pears that the trusts and theirechoes think it unsafe to
enforce the law. . ' . â¢
Captain Julius A. Penn of the reg

of course, understand just what he is
singing about.

and remain for the purpose of showing
America-at-home and the rest of the
world what manner of man it is In

Wearing Uncle Sam's uniform and
bearing, some of them, honorable scars,

Philippine Scouts look soldiers from
their neat little feet to the wiry black
hair that covers their well shaped
heads. Well drilled and under perfect
discipline, what they lack in size they
make up in Intelligence jind it is easy
to believe the glowing accounts given
by their ofnceis of the value of the
little soldiers, both as police and in
fantry.
The Philippine Scouts were organized
in 1901, when Congress, appreciating
the services rendered by the Maca
bebes. authorized the enlistment of 12,
000 natives as scouts. The Macabebes
had been loyal to Spain and when the
islands passed to America they were the
first to assert loyalty to the new flag.
Fifty companies were organized. They
.were recruited from half a dozen dif
ferent tribes. The hereditary enmities
of some of these tribes promised to be
a source of trouble, but the fears prov
ed groundless. Before everything else
the native Filipino seems to be a sol
dier and, once in uniform, can be de
pended upon not to allow personal feel
ings to interfere with military duty.

the legatee under the will, upon the j
grounds that it had been shown that s
there had been mismanagement and !
fraud and failure to render an account- j
ing. Since that time the estate has .
been without an executor, and the i
Public Administrator, upon that show- :
ing, wants the court to give him i
authority to handle it. I
Maria Krzyankowski died intestate i
at St. Joseph's Hospital on February 1, j
1903. In her will phe named Charles [
Rickman, an old friend, as residuary ;
legatee, after several small bequests to
religious organizations.- In the docu
ment, which was witnessed by Attor
ney G. H. Perry and H. W. Gantner, !
she declared that she was without kin.
Shortly after the filing of the will for'
probate Marie Nightengale, also known
as Maria Krzyankowski, through her
attorney, Charles Nagle, filed a contest |
to the will, alleging that she was the |
daughter of the deceased and therefore j
entitled to the $30,000 estate. Before !
the case came to trial a compromise j
was effected by the payment of $10,000.
There was much bitterness between
Attorney Perry, representing Rickman,
and Attorney Charles Nagle, and the j
latter, in a petition filed July 6, 1S03, J
says that Rickman hypothecated and |
pawned a portion of- the property, and
embezzled, concealed, smuggled and :
disposed of money and jewelry. He \
also accused 'him of being unreliable
and said that most of the property had
been turned over to Perry, whom he
designated as an irresponsible person.
During some of the court procedings
angry words passed between the two
contesting attorneys. Perry maintained I
upon several occasions that Nagle was i
endeavoring to foist a false heir on the Â¦
courts. .
Notwithstanding this, in a motion for
a bill of particulars filed January 3,
1904, in the contest of the will institut
ed by Aloyzy Sylvester Borkowski.
Nagle and Perry are named as counsel !
for Rickman. Gantner, one of the wit
nesses of the will, who was an under
taker on Mission street, presented a
claim for $1356 75 for funeral expenses,
in which he made a charge of $1000 for
a casket and trimmings. The claim
was paid by Rickman as executor, and
this is one of the charges of misman
agement of which Judge Troutt took
judicial cognizance.

will be children's day, when they will

them, a feature of which will be an

will be 50 cents, both afternoons and
evenings.

The members of this society, whose
especial care is the management of
the homeâ the Animals* Refugeâ after
long deliberations and incessant labors
have prepared for their initial function
this Indian tea, and that it will be
liberally patronized at 50 cents per
ticket is a foregone conclusion. For
behold the attraction:
A wealth of rare Indian baskets,
numbering over 300. contributed by col
lectors and enthusiasts; a unique col
lection cf lT-O aboriginal pipes, hats,
trinkets and many other ethnological
curios will adorn the walls. One large
room, with its walls entirely covered
ulth Xavajo blankets and ornamented
with valuable Indian relics from the
collection of c. C. Lord, will be
devoted to a group of wigwams, where
the visitors will be entertained by
lealirtic Indian marriage ceremonials,
worship, Indian folk songs, juggling
aiid dances. Here, too, typical Indian
tea and refreshments will be dispensed,
while the more conventional refresh
ments will be served in the main din
ing-room.

The directors of the Pacific Coast
Baseball League met last night In the
office of President Bert and com
pleted their arrangements for the
forthcoming season. Those In attend
ance were: President Bert, Henry
Harris and Theodore Goodman, of San
Francisco; J. Cal Ewing of* Oakland.
Mike Fisher of Tacoma. Parke Wilson
of Seattle and James F. Morley of Loa
Angeles.
Henry Harris, as chairman of the
schedule committee, presented the list
of dates for the season of eight
months. The novel feature of this
is that San Francisco Is left without
baseball for weeks in the height of thÂ«
season. This was found necessary In
order to give the other cities on the
circuit a proper proportion of games.
After the meeting adjourned Man
ager Morley of Los Angeles asked per
mission to bring up, informally, the
case of Captain Dillon, the crack
first baseman of the Los Angeles team.
He then put his case before his asso
ciates in a much plainer light than It
had been presented heretofore. He
showed where Ned Hanlon had acted
outside his official capacity as a repre
sentative of the Minor League, the lat
ter organization not having acted on
the'Dillon case. Hanlon used his con
nection with that body to further the
interests of his Brooklyn National
Leagtie Club, for which he want3
Dillon.
President Bert said no formal demand
has been made for Dillon. Manager
Morley will appeal his case to the re
cently organized National Commis
sion, the Supreme Court of the base
ball world, and expects a favorable de
cision, which will enable him to re
tain D'llon.

Present indications point to a field of
six starting for the Thornton stakes
at four piiles, on Saturday. Mike Daly
has decided not to start Claude, but
will try to land the event with Sailor
Knot Instead. It is pretty early in the
year to ask a three-year old to go that
distance.
George Mountain, who rode with
marked success at Los Angeles, receiv
ed a warm greeting from the crowd
as he paraded past the stand on Adir
ondack. His saddle work created a
favorable impression. '
Frank Otis was another rider heartily
applauded by racegoers. Frank piloted
Oronte, winner of the last event, his
first mount since receiving the hard
fall while riding Optimo some weeks
ago.
Max Franks, who has been booking
at Los Angeles, was a spectator yes
terday. He may decide to , cut in
later on.
Clerk of the Course Sam McGibben
was back attending to his duties again
yesterday after a week's illness, caused
by ptomaine poisoning.
EXTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
Frank Otis celebrated his return to
the saddle by reaching the wire first
on Oronte in the concluding' five and a
half furlong dash. The Piedmont
stable's sprinter ruled second choice
in the ring, and, ridden with excellent
judgment by Otis, downed the tardy
arriving Daisy Green a neck. Venator,
the favorite, led to the paddock, where
he tired, finishing in the show.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Solomon Bonner made no mistake
with Mr. Farnum, a 6U to 1 chance
for the mile and a furlong selling af
fair. Going *to the front right after
the start, the McCafferty horse won
In a common gallop, splashing in
seven open lengths in advance of
Mountain, astride Mr. Dingle. The
Fretter, under weak handling, gath
ered up show honors. C. Smith on
Fille d'Or, the favorite, made a botchy
job of it.
Hainault met with more success in
the mile and fifty yard number than
had crowned his previous two essays.
At one stage of the betting 6 to 5. the
brown gelding's price lengthened to
9 to 5. With Travefs in the saddle
he then went out and won all the way.
Horton gave a skeletonized imitation
of his old-time stretch run, finishing
second, two lengths before Anirad.
David S ran a fair fourth.
BOXXEIVS GOOD RIDE.
Bullman rode Velna in the two
year-old event and she was touted
from the Berkeley foothills to the
ocean beach as a cherry ripe one. At
post time 9 to 5 was the market price.
The filly has a sore mouth and when
Dick Dwyer released the barrier she
jumped in the air and was prominent
no part of the trip. Larsen handled
Bob Smith's Del Carina, an 8 to 1
chance, to excellent advantage, beat
ing "Big Bill" Knapp on Saccharate
a neck. Mizpah, which skipped away
in front and led into the stretch, took
the show.
Ocean Dream, a new-comer from Los
Angeles, did not win the six-furlong
handicap at Oakland yesterday, but
she was knocking at the door. Arabo,
from the Jennings stable, picked up
110 pounds, an increase of six pounds
over what, he carried last Friday, and,
well ridden by^Tack Martin, ran home
two lengths ahead of the Southern Cal
ifornia mare.
Sad Sam started out to- make the
running, and as sloppy going Is his
long suit, the '"it's all over" people
became somewhat noisy. But the stay
in front of the "Jungle demon" was
as abrupt as the visit of a fashionable
physician, and he finished fourth.
Probably the bulk of the educated
money found the way into the books
on Albula, which at one time ruled
favorite, though eventually closing
equal choice with Kenilworth. Bonner
rode an indiscreet v race, and the
Lamasney sprinter ran third, beaten
more than Â«two lengths for the place by
Ocean Dream.
Willie See jumped Into the wheel
house on Kenilworth without any chart
and, . striking a submarine mine, was
blown out of the running before hardly
in action. The winner was only spar
ingly supported.
OXE W1XXIXG CHOICE. '
There is no telling how much wealth
a person parlaying $20 on the six win
ners would be possessed of. He could
snub Pierpont Morgan, play brace faro
bank for ten years and still have
enough to keep his poor relations fig
uring out how many birthdays he
passed through.
Hainault was the only successful
public choice, Captivate, Del Carina,
Mr. Farnum, Arabo and Oronte all go
ing through deliciously fresh quota
tions.
Apparently the race the day preced
ing of Captivate did not impress spec-,
ulators greatly, for in the betting on
the opening event the mare's odds re
ceded from 3 to 7 to 1. Jack Martin
got her away in the lead and, holding
Maraschino safe, won cleverly by a
length. Mountain, on Adirondack, fin
ished third. Clausus, the entry of Tom
Ryan, was backed from 2% down to
7 to 5 favoritism, and after a catch-as
catch-can ride brought up in last posi
tion.

VCbeji Jimmy Britt finished boxing
â¢with his trial horse, Frank Rafael, at
his training quarters In AJameda yes
terday afternoon the .fighter who
achieved fistic fame in the first rush
for the Klondike as the "Kid of the
Yukon." said that Jimmy had landed
more right -baxd blows on him than In
Â«ny f.oxe bout the two have had since
Britt settled down to work at Croll's
gardens.
There has been an impression among
many who have observed Britt In bis
prelimicsry boxing that his right band
was not as it ?hould be and that the
little fighter used it gingerly. When he
eliminated boxing to a great extent
fiom his daily programme during the
past week some of the critics surmised
that Britt's knuckles were not with
standing the beating he was Inflicting
upon their and ttai he was compelled,
ms a precautionary mearure. to give bis
hands a rest.
In his siove work yesterday Jimmy
had his right constantly in action and
vas rr^eaiedly instructed by Spider
Kelly in the delivery of new blows with
that arm. Britt asserts that his right
Â«nn does not trouble him in the least
and that he has no fear that it will
become disabled in his next battle.
Britl weighed about 135 pounds yes
terday. He finds it easy to take off
â¢â¢evpraJ poucflp in a run on the road- so
he Is not Â¦worryins about making 130
poncd?.
Young: Corbett surprised the intend
ing spectator? at his quarters yester
day by clearing out the gymnasium.
33*> then exacted 25 cents from all who
TViinted to see him train. The little
< hamrion explained that he had been
bothered by people who fell asleep on
the benches and wanted to shut out
those who made a lounging place of his
training camp.
After skipping the rope a fewhun
drÂ«Â»d times, punching the bag and the
big swinging dummy Corbett took on
Monte Auel for three rounds. AJtel
fought nurd and the champion made
no apparent oflfort to ward off the
punishment, but seemingly had the
same relish for face wallops that an
epicure has for a twelve-minute duck.
The three round? were fart and the
(TOTd cheered Attel at the conclusion
Â«'f the bout.
The next bout was with Bobbie
Johnson. Johnson was as quick as a
Ftreak of lightning and won the ad
miration of the crowd. As before,
Corbett would cover his face and let
th*Â» speedy little boxer rush him from
one sidff of the ring to the other. The
ihampion joshed Johnson during the
throo rounds and at the conclusion
ask^d him to come Â«*very day.
Eddie Graney arrived at,Sheehan's
while the champion was skipping the
rope. CJraney started something with
the punching bag and Corbett jokingly
threatened to have him thrown out
unless he "came through" with 25
cents.
While Corbett will not let his weight
lx? known, it is easy to see he is rapid
ly rounding into perfect condition and
that he is not far above the weight
limit. Kid Hermann, who will chal
lenge the winner of the Corbett-Britt
CO. was among the spectators yester
day at Sheehan's.

Oirbett will beat Jimmy Britt in their
fi^ht next week." said Terry McGovern
to-day. 'Rounds? Well, that would
be merely guesswork, and I don't want
to go on record for that. Britt is a
great little fighter, as is Corbett. and
Â¦w ho can state reliably whether the
bout will last one or twenty rounds?
There are three reasons why I believe
<V>rbett will win, but at the same time
the fight appears so even that should
any one venture to offer 2 to 1 on either
man, be it Corbett or Britt, I will take
the short end with $2500.
â¢â¢Britt will have to give away sev
eral pounds to get down to the weight.
l"0 pounds, and that, I believe, will
â¢weaken him in a way that will count
much in Corbett's favor. Then, again,
Corbctt has a punch, while Britt is
not noted for scoring knockouts. Cor
bctt also has a method which does
more toward beating a man, or lead
ing to that, than any of the Denver
boy's famous hooks and uppercuts.
That method is abusing his opponent
with taunting remarks, which gener
ally riles his opponent to the boiling
point. In his anger he makes a mad
rush, gets off his guard. leaves an
opening and Corbett plants his knock
out. Britt, I know, is a hot-headed
fellow, and when once driven to mad
ness will either pummel his opponent
to a pulp in his attacks or he will tem
porarily lose his science and meet the
fame fate as others. Corbett, being as
cool as a cucumber at all stages, the
result will probably be in his favor."

the Judge she said her husband prob
ably had taken charge of her children,
but she was rot sure what had become
of them.
The Society for the Prevention of

case.

found guilty of assault, and when
Judge Mogan looked at the green neck

"Because," he explained, "it would

hop, step and leap; running broad
jump, throwing 12-pound weight, 42

cially constructed platform, and
In the afternoon at the Presidio ath
letic grounds, one of the great events
will be the hurling match between the
Emmets and the Independents. As
these two teams are considered among
the best players in the United States,
those in attendance may expect a
game that will prove of interest from
start to finish. The universities, col
leges and schools having athletes have
entered them for the valuable cup of
fered by Michael Casey for a relay
race. All the athletic events have
many entries, and as many of the
athletes are now In condition for tests
of speed and strength, one of the
largest field days ever held on the Pa
cific Coast will be the result. Every
amateur desiring .to compete may do
so by presenting a Pacific Athletic
Association card to the field clerk on
the grounds.
The exercises for the evening include
an overture of Irish airs by Allen's
concert band, an address by T*I Seary.

sleigh-bell solo by Miss Nettle Waters,
vocal solos by E. D. O'Sullivan and
Bert Murphy and' an exhibition drill by

The arrangements made by the St.
Patrick's day convention for the cele
bration of the day of Erin's patron
saint have aroused great enthusiasm
among the Irish people of this city, and
the committee having the affair in
charge is sparing no time or trouble
to accommodate the vast throngs that
are expected to attend the field day at
the Pre3idlo athletic grounds In . the
afternoon, and the literary exercises
and hall at the Mechanics' Pavilion in
the evening.
The affair this year will take on the
features of a great national celebraÂ«
tion. as the stirring events throughout
the world have, in the opinion of the
Irish people, had a direct bearing in
favor of their much-cherished hopes
for Ireland, and so it is that Mechanics'
Pavilion is expected to be filled with
a great number of patriotic Irishmen.
A petition was filed by interested
property owners with the Board of
Supervisors yesterday requesting that
provision be made in the next budget
to purchase the right of way extend
ing from Twenty-first to Twenty
fourth avenue for a sewer. The City
Engineer has recommended that the
improvement be carried out.
J. *>ose#iberg and W. ./. Allen, rep
resenting* the Point Lobos, Richmond
and Oceanslde' Ii. jrovement clubs,
urged the board to recommend the re
paving with bituminous rock of H
street from First to Twenty-second
avenues. It was represented that there
was no paved thoroughfare leading to
the ocean, and that H street should be
improved to afford necessary relief.
The city "will have to bear one-half of
the expense, as Golden Gate Park runs
along the thoroughfare. namfd. .
The boardfS promised, to co-operate
with the improvement" 'clubs. .It" being
stated that the Engineer had in
cluded in his recommendations for
street work that H street be improved
from Stanyan to the ocean at a total
cost of approximately $00,000.
D. Dederky called attention to the
bad condition - of Fell street' from
Franklin to Van Ness avenue, due to
the street car rails having been taken
up. O. C. Pratt told of a choked-up
sewer at Walnut and Franklin streets,
and that the electric lUht at that cor
ner was never lighted. The board di
rected its inspectors to investigate the
complaints.
To-morrow morning the board will
hear the various Improvement clubs re
garding their desires for Improvements.
Right of Way for Sewer.
The proposed project found a stanch
champion in Park Commissioner Frank
J. Sullivan, who said that the plan
should be extended so as to take in
Dolores street from Market to Eight
eenth, a distance of four blocks. Instead
of only tw^ blocks as originally con
templated. This would connect the
"parked" street with the new public
square designed to be constructed
under the bond issue.
The Board of Public Works expressed
itself in favor of the project, which it
thought would cost about $10,000. Be
fore recommending it to the Board of
Supervisors, however, a condition was
Imposed that the signatures of the
property owners along the four blocks
described be secured in order to avoid
the possibility of a subsequent protest
against the improvement. It was stat
ed that all the property owners favored
the plan and it will low be a matter
only of procuring their formal written
agreement to that effect.
The Board of Public Works held a
special meeting yesterday for the pur
pose of hearing petitions .from taxpay
ers for various improvements, provision
for which may be made in the next mu
nicipal budget. The board desired to
ascertain the preferences of property
owners in that regard In order that the
necessary recommendations can be
made to the Board of Supervisors in
fixing the appropriations.
The California Outdoor Art League,
through Mrs. G laser and Mrs. Wagner,
addressed the board in behalf of Its pe
tition to park Dolores street from Fif
teenth to Seventeenth. The ladies
named argued In favor of beautifying
some of the boulevards of this city, and
thought a beginning should be made on
Dolores street on account of Its histori
cal connection with the old missions.
Michael Davitt, the great Irish
leader, is expected to deliver an ad
dress in the Pavilion In the evening,
and this in itself will be a rare treat to
those interested In Irish affairs.
twenty-five Irish pipers will also ap
pear and play the music that delights
the sons and daughters of the "old
sod."
The Board of Election Commission
ers continued its policy of evading the
civil , service provisions of the charter
by putting ten clerks to work yester
day, seven of whom are not on the
civil service eligible list. The other
three are on the list and were appoint
ed after due certification was made by
the Civil Service Commission to the
Election Commission. A similar eva
sion was recently carried out when
twenty "warehouse men" were em
ployed to the exclusion of the register
ed laborers on the list of the Civil Ser
vice Commission.
The three civil service men appoint
ed yesterday are E. R. Faucompre, F.
E. Preble and W. W. Bausmann. The
seven that were not certified by the
Civil Service Commission, but were ap
pointed merely for political reasons,
are W. W. Jackson, D. C. R. McCarthyr
B. E. Ullner, W. G. Bright, L. F. Cull,
C. W. Merritt and J. L. Hart. They
are all employed In registering voters
for the next election.
It has always been the custom of the
former Election Commission to appoint
the men from the list of civil service
ordinary clerks after requisition had
"been made on the Civil Service Com
mission. The present Election Com
mission saw an opportunity to -evade
the civil service law and instead of
making requisition for ordinary clerks
sent a communlcatlbn to the Civil Ser
vice Commission asking that three dep
uty registrars be certified for appoint
ment.
There are five such eligibles on the
list and, three of themâ Faucompre,
Preble and Bausmann â were appointed.
Another eligible waived certification
and the fifth one for some reason was
not selected. Then to fill up the list
of the ten men to be appointed, seven
that had passed no civil service exam
ination were pressed Into service to
the exclusion of the eligibles that have
hitherto performed the work.

DEPARTS FROM CUSTOM
It was a thrilling recital, but the de
fendant did not seem to be vividly im
pressed by it. Treadwell stated that
he had missed a number of books and
was satisfied to have Smith's punish
ment confined to exposure of his dis
honesty. Smith said he had been em
ployed by Treadv.-ell to bring clients
to him and cited one instance where
he had been paid S3 for supplying
Tread wo II with a customer.

fcek optical relief by gazing at the
sunbeams dancing upon the attorneys'
table, and even the inmatps of the pris
oners' cage ehaded their eyes with their
hats. But the bevy had its wait for
nothing. When the prosecution had
concluded its testimony the court con
tinued the case till to-day, and while
instructing the ladies for the defense
accused Smith of theft; that Smith
denied guilt; that Treadwell tapped
his (Smith's) vest and proceeded to
search him; that Smith yielded up the
book.
"Legislative"' Ed Smith, bo called

a clerical servitor of every California
lawmakirig body lhat has assembled
since th* oldest inhabitant of Sacra
mento was a juvenile, appeared before
Judge Cubaniss on a charge of petty
larceny, he having, it was alleged, pil
fered a book froni the law library of
Attorney Tread well.
The case was dismissed because At
torney Treadwell refused to file a
formal complaint, but the evidence
went to show that a young woman
employed in that gentleman's office
had been instructed to keep an eye on
Smith, whose honesty was doubted;
that the young woman did so; that

the last Legislature and slip it under

reserve.
When the young woman was ar
rajÂ£rr.ed last Monday on a charge of
vagrancy her genteel appearance and
demeanor made a marked impression
upon all experienced observers. Bail
iff Hlckey, who has studied human na
ture on two continents, believing she
was ar. aristocrat in hard luck, and
Clerk Gray, who has attained some
fame as a shrewd analyst of feminine
character, offered odds that she would
turn out to be a highly accomplished
adventuress of the conventional dime
r.ovel species. She looked either of
those parts. Her features were clear
cut, her complexion was healthy, her
attire neither garishly "loud" nor
Quakerishly modest, her deportment
dignified. And curiosity as to her
identity was whetted by her firm but
courteous refusal to enlighten the
court as to how she happened to be
Intoxicated, penniless and aimlessly
wandering in Chinatown last Sunday
night.
"She must have been drugged,
robbed and set adrift by some con
scienceless scoundrel, to whose keep
ing she intrusted her honor â her very
life," whispered the bailiff to the clerk.
"Or she was working some rich guy
and miscalculated her own capacity
for booze," ventured the clerk.
Persistent questioning from the
bench tore away the fabric of romantic
mystery that had been woven around

Jason Jackson disapeared from the
Harbor Hospital, where his wounds
were dressed, and since last Monday
he has been tracked by Policeman Joy.
That tireless sleuth followed the trail
to the San Bruno road, where it ceased
and baffled all his efforts to recover it.
Even bloodhounds, he believed, might
be unable to pick it up, aa the San
Bruno is a much-traveled highway and
colored folk are by no means compara
tively rare among those that pass
over It.
"Well. I'll give you another day at
ft," said the court, "and if you fail to
produce Jason Jackson, here to-morrow
I'm afraid your case against this de
fendant will be shaky."
Joy returned to the hunt.
- Â» â¢ â¢
Police Officer Joy reported progress

several soldiers In a Barbary Coast re
sort last Sunday night, and upon^vhose

court are dependent the immediate fu

one of the assailants.
James Farrell, youthful, good looking
and stylishly appareled, was found
guilty of vagrancy and carrying a con
cealed weapon by Judge Mogan and
also received a rather scathing lecture
from the bench. Police Officer Connel
ly found Farreil standing at the cloeed
door of an apartment in a lodging
house at 18 Mason street and breathing
vengeance against a man and a woman
that were inside the room. A search
of Farrell rewarded the officer to the
extent of a big and sharp dagger.
Then the Judge asked the prisoner
what he did for a livelihood, and the
answers led to only one logical Infer
ence â that he subsisted on the bounty
of the scarlet woman ' whose life
he had threatened. He had not been
employed anywhere for five months
preceding his arrest, yet he was well
nourished and attired.
"You and your like would better be
at the bottom of the bay than circulat
ing among: decent people," said the
Judge, "and when you come up here to
morrow for sentence I will endeavor to
rid society of your presence for as long
a term as the law prescribes for your
double offense."
George Smith, whom Policeman Nel
son pronounced the most industrious
and irrepressible street beggar on the
Pacific Coast and entitled to champion
ship distinction in that line, was given
three months by Judge Mogan. Nel
son, to satisfy his curiosity, followed
Smith and within a period of three
minutes and a distance of less than one
block saw him accost and receive alms
from three individuals. Â»

doctor, "and then I swore to a com

"And by so doing you proved yourself
a good citizen," was the court's com
mendatory comment.
Gillette wanted to have his case dis
posed of right then and there, but his
employer arose amid the chair-warm
ers and announced his desire to be rep
resented by the counsel. So the matter
went over tilt to-day.
Dr. Mace of 406 Sutter street had Fred
Gillette, a driver for the Standard
Dairy, before Judge Mogan on a charge
erf distributing adulterated milk. The
complainant testified that for some time
he had entertained misgivings as to
the purity of the lacteal fluid served
to him daily by the defendant, and
the other morning he took some of it
to the Health Office and had it an
alyzed and his suspicion confirmed.

Noble K. Williams, who was arrested
for breaking open a clothes locker in
St. Ignatius Church gymnasium, will
be tried to-day in Judge Conlan's court.
The arrest was made by Policeman C.
J. Carroll.
Francis H. Coy of 736Â» Fourteenth
street stoutly maintained that one of
his prerogatives as a husband is to ad
minister corporal punishment to his
wife when, In his opinion, she is de
serving of chastisement, but Judge
Conlan took a directly opposite view
of the question and held Mr. Coy for
battery.
Mrs. Coy testified that Mr. Coy had
been in the habit of beating her, and
during their four years of marital in
felicity she never doubted his right to
do so until she became acquainted with
a member of the legal profession who
explained her rights in the matter.
While in possession of this enlighten
ment she declined to accompany Mr.
Coy to a downtown dinner and inciden
tally informed him that if he laid as
much as one punitive finger upon her
she would Invoke the law. "So you
have been talking to some du.'ned
shyster, have you?" said Mr. Coy, when
sufficiently recovered from the aston
ishment Into which he was plunged by
the wife's revolt. Then he adminis
tered a few blows to her head and
locked her up in their common sleep
ing apartment until she promised to
"be good."
Mr. Coy will be sentenced to-day, and
Mrs. Coy has announced her intention
to pro-cure a divorce.
Stealing: a loaf of _bread from a
Franklin-street doorstep was the charge
against Gustave Heitman in Judge
Conlan's court, and visions of a des
perate husband and father pilfering
food for a starving wife and babies
were rapidly fleeting through the Judi
cial mind, when the fact developed that
Gustave was an old offender at that
sort of game and that his sanity was
doubtful. His case was continued till

43 EXTRA LARGE LOTS.
.43 EXTRA LARGE LOTB.
PRICES $1650 TO $1S5O.
PRICES $1650 TO S1S50.
Terms â One-fifth cash, balance In 1. 2, S
and 4 years.
" An exceptionally handsome Western Addi-
tion block has Just been cut up into 45 extra
large lots, most of which are 33:4x120. Tho
block is near the corner of FirJt ave. and
California st.. and can easily be reached by
the Eddy-st. nnd Sacramentc-st. cars. Get
off at First ave. The conditions surrounding
the pale of this property are different from
thr> usual manner of selling property of this
t?hriracter.
Mr. i. C. Jordan, the owner, has Imposed
the following conditions, which are to be rlg-
idli- enforced :
No building will be allowed on thÂ«>. block
which will cost less than $3<XK>.
No building- shall be erected for objection-
able purposes. Including stores, livery stables,
coalyards, schools, churches, etc.
No three-story flats win be allowed.
If vou want to secure a nice residence* Bite
or make a good Investment the above common-
sense restrictions will insure not only thÂ« ad-
vance In value of lots in this block, but will
al?o protect any one who builds. Thousands
of people In the past few years have built
desirable homes and have been damaged or
ruined for tbe lack of just such protections.
In all other large cities In th" United States
the best property is scld under similar condi-
tion!", which are of benefit to all.
Special attention Is called to the targe lots.
It Is cheaper to build on a large lot than on a
small one, as it does away with the unsightly
and unsatisfactory light wells and shortens the
building, besides giving a more artistic appear-
ance on the outside. The Interior arrangement
la much better and you secure an abundance
of llcht and sun.
The large lots and the restrictions under
which the land is sold will Insure good neigh-
bors and an advance In the value of your
property. These, however, are not the only
facts which will advance the property. The
block is exceptionally well located. Is level
and all the streets are graded, sewered and
macadamized and are all 80 feet wide. The
prÂ« % pÂ»rty is right on the line of the city's
growth and the prices asked. $.10 to $55 a
front foot, are extremely low, as property
within a block or two Is nelllnc for from two
to three times the price asked for this.
An unusually splendid car service Is already
at hand, including the Eddy-st. electric, the
Sacramentost. cable, the Sutter and Clement-
st. line and the Geary and Callfornla-st. lines.
The last two- are soon to be changed Into
electric systems.
These are only a few of the .points to which
we wish to call your attention. We urgently
request you to make an Immediate inspection
of this property, and believe that if you do
you will agree 'With us that the property pre-'
sents nn unusual nnd unequaled opportunity
for either a homeseeker (Including 2 flats) as
well as an excellent Investment. If you will
look ahead for a year or two and take Into
consideration the rapid growth of the city
in this direction you will undoubtedly become
a purchaser.
Our agent Is on the ground on Sundays with
diagrams.

But for the energetic action of Captain Pen
dlcton and his crew the ship Aryan, which ar
rived yt-stetday from Baltimore, would probably
have been burned at sea. It was on February
lo that the daily inspection showed that the
<oal in the hold had acquired a temperature of
10S degrees. On turr.ing over the coal it was
found that the temperature increased, and
when it registered 142 degrees quick action be
came nt-eesszry to prevent a fire. All hands
were ordered below and commenced moving the
coal to the 'tween decks. At the end of ten
day?, when several hundred tons had been
transferred, the thermometers showed a dÂ«*
orease in the temperature. The coal gave no
further trouble and the Aryan reached port, 1.18
days from Baltimore, with 3846 tons of coal in
good condition. .'"â¢"

The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Sonoma arrived early yesterday
mornins from the Antipodes and Hono
lulu with a full eargro and many pas
sengers. For the first time in many
voyages the Sonoma reached port
about nine hours late. She should have
been here before sundown Monday, but
â¢was delayed between Sydney and
Auckland by heavy weather. She
reached the Xew Zealand port an hour
after her schedule time for departure.
Under ordinary circumstances the So
noma could have made up the lost
time, but winter gales encountered
later proved too heavy a handicap, and
for once the liner's arrival overlapped
her schedule.

Hops are quoted quiet and lower. Stocks ar*
about one-half those at this time last year, but
about as large as In the two preceding years.
The decline affects both spot and contract
goods. The New York market Is dull. The
Portland Telegram of a recent date says of the
Oregon market:
"The Hop market Is decidedly quiet and no
buyers or brewers are " In sight at . present.
Speculators who paid as high as 20c a pound a
few months ago are getting dlscVmragad, as
when they bought 30c and even 40c was talked
of as among the possibilities, A sale of 130
bales, of choice Hops March 7 at 24 %c indi
cates how the demand for that product stands.
The seller had paid 27 %c a few months ago
and thus lost 3c a pound on the transaction."

The situation stands the same everywhere,
the market being more or 'less weak. Local
merchants report a fair average demand for
cured meats and barreled goods, at prices
which have ruled for a week or so.
Provisions.
The Government is out with another call for
bids on 2382^ tons of Hay,, deliverable at San
Francisco Seattle, Tacoma or Portland, the
bids to be opened April 15. This Imparts re
newed strength to the market and with the
lighter receipts offsets the . recent depression
on account of the copious rains. But there
Is still a large quantity in the railroad yards,
accumulated during the recent storm, and un
til that is cleared away . there is very little
chance for ' the market to strenst-hen. . Prices

Trading In Oranges was quite active owing
to the clearer weather, but supplies were still
far In excess of the demand and conditions still
favored buyers, who took advantage of the low
prices and purchased freely. The outlook for
better prices is gloomy, as supplies on the way
to this market are large, ten cars being sched
uled for to-day'a auction. The other Citrus
fruits were in free supply and featureless and
Bananas and Pineapples were unchanged. The
steamer Sonoma brought up 3395 bunches of
Bananas and 25 crates Pineapples.
Strictly fancy Apples were firm and some,
dealers were asking $2 25 for the best New
town Pippins, but sales at that flgjire were
rare. Ordinary fancy fruit was steady, while
common and the choice grades were neglected,
as peddlers and small dealers were working
almost exclusively on Oranges

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, March . 15. â Bearish sentiment
pervaded the pit at the opening, the cause
being lower Liverpool cables and lower North
west receipts. Initial quotations on May were
off '/4ti^c at JHi%@tW%e. July was down
U6%c to M.<3%c at i>ivi<&91%c. In absence
oi any mattrml support the market developed
greater weakness. May declining to i)5%c and
July to !.'i('s<\ On the slump there wai good
buying of July .from an influential quarter.
Th<J demand was so persistent that prices
finally yielded and 6tarted upward. Shorts
covered, freely on the bulge and there was
also "a''gt>Qd Commission-house "demand, i The
advancing tendency was coincident with an
unusually strong cash demand and firmness
in out.sMe markets. Reports of a remarkable
pcarcity of cash wheat and of the> strenuous
efforts millers were making to get material
for "grinding were pronounced factors in creat
ing a strong tone during the last hour. One
of the reports was to the effect that St.
Louis had sold 2U0.00O bushels of wheat to
go to Mlnneaoolis. As the session drew near
the end offerings were hard to find. In view
of this condition and the active demand clos
ing prices were at the tip-top. May 97 %c and
July 93c.
Heavy selling of the July option character
ized early trading in the corn pit and In conse
quence the market ruled weak. The close was
strong and practically at the top price. May
opened tt@%c lower at 53%Â®r>3%c. _After
selling between 53%c and 54%o the close was
Â«t 54%c. July ranged between 51c and 52lÂ£c
and closed at 52 %c, with a net gain of %(&%i*.
The action of other grains was largely the
dominating Influence in trading In oats. The
close was steady at a small decline. After
opening %<flft c lower at 40%#llc May
rnnged between 40%@40%c and 41c and closed
at 41c. July closed with a loss of %@V4c at
at'Ssc.
The weakness injgrain brought out selling
orders In provisions early in the day. For n
time the market showed weakness, but with
; the advance In wheat and corn a better de
mand for hog product* developed, resulting in
a steadier tone. The close on May pork was
a shade lower at $14@14 02%. May lard was
unchanged at $7 25 and ribs down 5c at
f7 22%. ______

BARLEY â All sorts of stories about the Ori
ental demand are floating at>out the market
and most of them are, subsequently denied. A
certain shadowy lot for Japan (some say Rus
sia) varying In alze from 2500 to 5000 tons,
has been sold so many times lately that Its
corners are getting round. That there has
really been a line sold for the Orient seems
certain, and It is reported that the parties who
bought It (Russian or Japanese) want more,
and that is about as close to the matter as" can
be learned at present, for the story changes
every day. A reliable authority places the sale
at 5C0O tons. The market still rules flrm and
the advance Is maintained without difficulty,
offerings being light. The May option was
lower yesterday, while December was higher.

The depression In Cheese* continues. It has

Receipts of Eggs suddenly ran up yester
day, as will be seen, but they are stilt about
25@o3 per cent smaller than last year at this
time. The local demand Is heavy, there Is a
brisk shipping movement to the north and
speculators are still In the field for stock to
store. Under these conditions Eggs carmot
very well help advancing, and prices were
about 1c better yesterday, with' the market
very firm.
The tone of the Butter market remained
unchanged. Receipts continued to show an in
crease, as trains were coming In more freely,
but the demand was good and there was no
accumulation.

The wffk!;- rerÂ«irt of A. G. UcAdit. section
d>rÂ«ct*>r of tiie climate and crop cÂ«rvice of the
V**thÂ«r Bureau, j s as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
Nearly normal t<>nRpÂ»rature prevailed
throughout thÂ»- ttate during the week and the
Â«eathÂ«r uas ;?<n*ral!y cloudy or tmrtly cloudy.
The heavy ntinfall on thÂ» ftth and lCth was
â¢cronpanKd bjr unusually high southeast winds
in .ih^ o-ntrÂ«l and tiorthern wectlons. the most
â¢evere ever experienced ia lome places. Trees
Â»er* upr-jotert. builiin^s ur.roofed and wind
mills and imcf biown down. The excessive
rainfall In Northern California caused a rapid
ri*f o! river* and creeks, which overflowed
their bank* ar-d flood-d train lands and
un-harts. The cncwfall in the mountains was
unu?uÂ£lly heavy and extended well down into
the toothillc.
Tb* flooded grain inndk in th* Saeramento
and S^an Joa-jum valleys were again inundated
end tht damage will probably be very heavy.
Ir. some case* It is believed itr.poBEible to drain
tht landÂ£ in time to raUe croi>iÂ» of any kind.
On the lands in those districts not under water
Â¦ is :n good condition and growing rapidly,
Â¦Â«;t!i rroM.'<-cts of a large crvjÂ«. From San
Francisco southward tliÂ» rainfall was lighter
than in the north, but was of immense benefit
to all crop*. In the (southern toast district*
grain is In cowl condition and the outlook Is
eaid to bt as tiK.d at. at this date Jast year.
In tlir Scuth<rn K?n Joa4]u!n Valley and South
era California grain and hay pro*j>ectB are
tÂ«--tter than at. Â«nj- time during the season.
Â¦ ;..'â¢ f?td If plentiful in all etrctionu and cattle
ajx- '.L.-.i. well.
Tin- hiirh winds cauted tnme damage to
orchards', nÂ»air.:>- jn tlie uprootir.R of trses, but
th/ 1 lots wlli nut be sever*-. Deciduous fruit
tree* *re in Mourn in ail sections and give
indications of a large yield. Southern vine
yords were Ix-nffited by the rain.
VALLEV- The weather was
Bonesttt cooler than during the preceding
â¢rede The high southeast wind on the lÂ»th and
ICth wax accornpar.iÂ»-d by heavy rainfall, both
causing great ...:.-:;!,-.. At tfacranjeato the
m-:*;d rencttd a velocity of 65 miles an hour,
th 1 -- hlii;e>=t ever recorded. TrÂ»*Â» were ui>
nxted. virAmills and fences biown down an<J
tnu<h other daxnafe reteulted Cmta the wind.
Orchar'ie and grain lends were again flooded
by Uir "Xianssjve rainfall ana overflowing
streams, and the <lair.Â«KÂ« will probably be
great, cyiHicially on lowlands. There v.-a* a
vry heavy Itll of enow in the mountains.'ex
tcndii'-s well down to tht foothills. On lands
not flooded *r.d rraÂ« axe in excellent
coriiiUr.n Â«nu {trÂ«u*lng: rarifliy. Orchards were
not tnjtertally darmM-ed crcept In the uprooting
of a. few trees Â»n<l j t-Tju . ts are coo4 lor Urge
emirs.
OOAET AND BAY SECTIONSâ Nearly nor
mal ternperaturt- prevailed during the veelc and
the weÂ£tntT Â»Â»* Cfnerally cloudy and rainy.
The etenr. on the iitii and lOtlv was the roost
of the eeaaoa. Much damnge. was
caused In all : â¢Â¦- :>â¢,â¢,<Â¦ by the high wind, though
cropu were nc4 materially injured. The heavy
rx.infsll In the <fntÂ«il and northern districts
caused r.n overflow of rivers and creeks and
some crain wan probably damaged. â ttridges
were wa**fcd away and ihe roads are in very
lÂ»a<] condition. In the southern districts the
rainfail vaiU-d from 1.50 to a.i5 inches for the
Â¦we*k and vm very beneficial. The correepond
Â«it at HcllUter reiiorts that the grain and
Iruit Â¦9UtloÂ«>k in that *ection is now as good us
at the t-. r..< date last year, and this ie prob
etily true of nearly all sections.
BAN* JOAqi'IN VALLEYâ Cloudy, warm
Â¦uÂ«ather uith g*nerouÂ« rains prevailed during
the week. These condition* were most favor
ali!e Kt the rrowth of all crops end rreen
'.'-.&. Grain and uran- hav> made rapid growth
jÂ»:n2 paclurage is now plentiful. i/i-clduous
fruits are generally in bloom and lexilng out.

lanfe and U\un&t in the northern portion of
the valley *ih - mostly floo.:i <i by breaks in

London, spot closing Â£1 2s 6d and futures Â£1
5s lower. The former position closed at Â£125
15s a.nd the latter at Â£125 10s. Locally tin
was weaker also, closing at $27 75@2S 10, with

The high southeast wind on the 10th did con
f:i>ra!jlc damage in some sections, destroying
windmill* uprooting trees, and In tome places
unroofing ' houses. Plowing is progressing in
the southern part of the valley. Considerable
snow \* r>-iÂ«-rtod in the mountain*.
BOCTHEBN CALIFORNIAâ The weather
Â«e.Â« warm i-.nd olfar during the first of the
week an<1 was followed l>> cloudy weather and
thÂ»- heaviest, raimall of the season, unmounting
to r.bcut two inches in some places. Â¦ At > Up
land the reason's precipitation in C.17 inches,
at Pov.ay 4.5$ inehp*, at tfan Diego 2.0.1 incheB,
at Los Angclef 4!i5 inchep. Grain and vine
vards were sreatly bf-n^flttd by the rain. The
early sown grain is up and locking well in
mary Dlaces and ita crowth will be hastened
by the recent rain. A good hay crop new
sperAf assured and tuore may be fair <tods of
Â»i:eat and barley. Pasturage is plentiful. Apri
cots, srv it, bloom at Anaheim.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARYâ Rain came just
in time to save grain, which was dying in
P'.ac^F. but it is growing well since.* A few
late rains will make fair crops generally. Lost
rain promises fair hay crop on dry lands.
The Poultry market was in good shape, with
receipts light and the demand steady, young
stock particularly being wanted. No more
Wectern cam* in and what was carried over
from the preceding day was readily disposed
of. Common Callfornlan Hens were dull, as re
tailers were well sut>plled with lare* Western
Hens, which constituted the bulk of the heavy
receipts of the preceding day.
- Game was unchanged, receipts being Just
about sufficient to satisfy tbe demand.

LIST OF GUESTS.
Dr. Washington Dodge, the Assessor,
closed the speaking with " happy re
marks on "The Native Sons'," paying
a compliment to the guest of honor as
one of the most worthy members of
that organization.
"What is to be the result?" To thdulge In
prediction the present time would be but
to reptat the argument wMch has prevailed In
the determination of this .nation to construct
this waterway. All reasoning from existing
conditions to future results must . undergo
many modifications In reaching just conclusion.
In this Instance, the centuries of delay pay
just v tribute to the magnitude of the under
taking. And now that, hope is to be rewarded
for :>atient waiting, now that prophecy is to
undergo the test of fulfillment, even unfal
tering faith cannot wholly forego the question.
At last all the forces nf opposition have
been overcome; at last a great nation has de
creed that, comrnf-rcfally speakin-r, a new
ocean shall come into bolng. And now, after
nearly 4('<Â» years lrom the'-birth of the idea,
we assemble around this banquet board, in the
chief metropolis of a Pacific empire, to con
gratulate the honored guÂ«st of this evening
that all obstructions have been removed, all
opposition overcome, and that he and his as
s >ciatea may now enter uiwn the consumma
tion of this treat enterprise.
W. II. MUls was introduced to speak
to the toast, "The Panama Canal."
He said in jiart:
During' the last four centuries, students of
commercial gutsniihy have tully compre
hended the rust lmijr>rt.?Jice to the. commerce
of the world of the oonstiuction of an isthmian
canal. They -have clearly perceived the great
influence such a waterway would have upon
ths distribution of. national power' arising
out of t!-.e relative commercial supremacy of
the nations. The construction of that, water
way has bi'en obstructed, impeded and actually
prevented by national jealousies, by the inertia
of conservatism and by the greed and selfish
ness of tbou whose interests were in the
maint'Tiarce of existing conditions.
BENEFITS OF TIIK CANAL.
a man of unimpeachable honor. (Applause.)
We are here to-night doing a rather singular
thing- for a San Kranci5co audience â three
hundred of ub actually boosting a man. (Great
laughter.) What could we not do if we could
agree to boost a man who is not leaving us!
MEMBER OF THE PANAMA CA
NAL, COMMISSION, WHO WAS
BANQUETED LAST NIGHT.
Don't imagine for an instant.- that. I -am
going to talk about thÂ« charter. (Laughter.)
I want to add my tribute to Mr. Grunsky â a
man of modesty, because he has spent several
years in office at the ..City.: Hall. -(Renewed
laughter.) . He 1Â» a man of , gentle," thorough,
clean character,, and the President--has.-hdn
orÂ«d -. himself by selecting him. ; No matter
what â¢ the temptations, i may be \ on that - com
mUsloa Grunsky will yield to none. ,Hu ia
In introducing Franklin K. Lane .. to
answer the toast "The City of San
Francisco," Toastmaster Phelan de
clared that "Men, not measures," are
the essential of progress. Mr.i Lane
said, among other things:
"Civic Progress" was the toast given
Frank J. Symmes, president "' of : , : the
Merchants' Association. â¢ " *
A 31 AX OF HONOR.
I want to congratulate Mr. Grunsky on thÂ«
magnificent opportunity he will have. of mak
ing mistakes. I have been told twice a week
for years that the chief use of engineers is to
make mistakes'. There Is a constant' conflict
between scientists and the technical men.' '.-ThÂ«
world at large places a very different estima
tion upon the work of the two claeses. But
there Is but one source 't>f ; relief for -toll
burdened humanity and that Is in the â¢ work
of technical men, engineers and the like,- who
grovel in the earthy applications of science.
Such men wear their lives out in toll for
their fellows and are forgotten, while- the
roan who gives the world a song is enshrined
forever in its grateful memory.. But our friend
whom we honor to-night . knows ; the art 1 aa
well as the science of engineering. . (Applause)
George W. Dickie of the Union. Iron
Works was then Introduced as a mas
ter, both of science and industry, to re
spond to. the toast "Science and Applied
Science." His response was full of : wit
and sense, and it kept, his audience In
good humor for the too few minutes he
occupied. In part he said: '
SCIENCE AND ITS USES.
It is estimated that the value of the work
already done on the canal approximates $40,
000,000. This estimate has been made the
basis of the proposed payment to the French
company. The estimated cost of completing
the canal on the lines indicated by the Canal
Commission is $144,000,000. It is thought that
eight to ten years should be required for the
completion of the work. That this is a work
of stupendous magnitude becomes apparent
when It is compared with such other great
works as the Suez Canal, opened In ISO,
which with its length of seventy-two miles,
coet about $60,000,000; and with the Man
chester Canal, thirty- five and a half miles
long, which cost about $75,000,000. The Â¦ last
Canal Commission assumes that the annual
cost of maintaining and operating the canal
will approximate $2.000,000.. It Is thought that
jipcrin the opening of the canal to traffic a ton
nage of about 5.000,000 per year will pass
through it. and that this amount will be dou
bled within ten years.
Front Colon, on the Atlantic side, the-canal
will extend inland on low ground, closely fol
lowing the Chagres River for a distance of
seventeen miles. The canal is there.' to' be
closed by a dam and Its water surface raised,
and thÂ» lake formed by the dam will bfr used
as a canal section for a distance of about
fourteen miles. The next eight miles will l>o
In the great Culebra cut. I The remainder of
the canal, about ten miles In length, will be
on low ground, adjacent to the Bay of Pan
ama. . ; Â¦ â¢
Although the advantage of a sea- level con
nection between the oceans was recognized,
the disadvantages, among others, of Increased
time of construction and Increased cost of such
a project led the commission to plan the canal
with a summit level about ninety feet above
the ocean The canal la to be made thirty-five
feet deep' It is to have a bed width of luÂ«
feet. It will be forty- nine miles long, from
the six-fathom line on the ' Atlantic nidÂ» to
the six- fathom line on the bay at Panama.
The maximum depth of cutting where thÂ«Â«
canal crosses the continental divide . will be
2Â»SG feet. In the construction of the canal the
amount of dredging and earth \tfork will be
about 42.000.fOO cubic yards, and 54.0u0.000
cubic yards of hard and soft rock will have to
be moved, of which amount about E-ono.OfiO
cubic yards lie under water. Nearl, .^tOO.OiK)
cubic yards of concrete will be required and
upward of C5.C00.CO0 pounds of iron and steel
will, it is estimated, be needed for the various
structures on the line of the canal.
In rising to answer Commissioner
Manson's toast, Mr. Grunsky found
himself the" object of repeated volleys
of cheers. When at last he was able to
speak, he briefly and modestly reviewed
his work for the city and outlined his
ambitions for the San Francisco of the
future. Especial emphasis was given
to his argument for a municipal water
supply, the retiring City Engineer de
claring his belief that this was a neces
sity for the growing city and easily
within the possibilities of Congression
al action and engineering skill. Turn
ing then to the subject of the Panama
canal, he spoke as follows:
The great question this evening iÂ» the pro
posed Isthmian canal. I am not yet in a posi
tion to talk on this subject with a full under
standing of the various problems which will
confront the Canal Commission. The Idea of
uniting the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean at
Panama haa bfÂ«?n In the minds of men ever
since the first white man crossed the isthmus.
Examinations and surveys were made in the
early part of the Sixteenth century, nearly 40Â»
years ago, and the obstacles to be overcome in
carrying out this great work have been grad
ually removed one by one, until at last the
people of this great nation are in control and
with the means at hand to carry the work 10
successful completion.
The difficulties In the way of canal con
struction have, until recent yeare. been less of
a character Involving engineering skill than
such as involves statesmanship of a high or
der. After all of the failures that have been
made in the pa*t a project has been reported to
the United States by the Walker commission,
whose report is the basis for the acquisition
of the properties of the French company, and
this commission's plans of a canal best repre
sent the work as it will probably be carried
out.
OVATION TO GRUNSKY.
Engineer. He did well to select a great engi
neer for a great work. We wish you god
speed. Mr. Commlsaloner.
Among the guests who did valiant
work In fighting the flames until the
arrival of the firemen was Superior
Judge L<jTig'an of San Jose, who drag
ged out the hotel hose and turned on
the first stream.
Two Japanese servants were sleep
ing in tfte cupola of the building when
aroused by the glare of the flames.
They clambered down the Market-street
fire escape like monkeys and would
have Jumped from the first story if
Xhe onlookers had not shouted to them
to hold on until a ladder could be
raised. When they did strike the
ground they ran down Market street
at top speed, as though they never in
tended to stop until they reached To
kin and safety.
The Manhattan Hotel is a six-story
frame building containing more than
rooms and is a particularly inflam
mable structure.! The building is owned
by M. B. de Levader and the lessee is
J. P. Gallagher.
George Hartman of truck No. 1 was
cut on the hand with an ax while fight
ing the flames. His injuries were treat
ed at the Emergency Hospital and are
pronounced slight.
Most of the guests, about seventy
in number, rushed into the hall and
a few became panic stricken and, pack
ing up what belongings they could
gather, fled to the office floor. One
woman, being unable to carry her
trunk, dumped its most valuable con
tents into Â« spread and staggered down
the stairway with her bundle. Half
a dozen more appeared in the office
Â¦with bags and stood tremblingly around
until assured that all danger was past.
Three male lodgers sought escape down
one of the fire escapes on the Fcll
etreet side. The firemen put up a lad
der and helped one of them to the
street, but the other two climbed into
a window and went back to their apart
ments. Miss Hazel Colgan, daughter
of E. P. Colgan of Stockton, farmer
Harbor Commissioner, was, removed
from her room to the St. Nicholas Ho
tel, in a semi-conscious condition. She
has been ill at the Manhattan for four
weeks and it is feared the shock may
prove serious.
The kitchen adjoins the dining-room
on the top floor of the building, and
before an alarm was turned in the culi
nary department was all ablaze and
the flames were pouring from the win
dows and had burned a hole through
the roof. The department had no diffi
culty in controlling the blaze, which
â¢was confined entirely to the kitchen
and the roof. The cause of the fire
Â¦was a defective flue.
Fire . broke . out in the dining-room
of the Manhattan Hotel, at the corner
of Fell and Market streets, at 9:30
o'clock last night and before it was
checked damage amounting to about
55000 was done and a slight panic en
eued among the guests.

Marsden Manson of the Board of
Public Works was the next speaker,
proposing the toast "Our Isthmian Ca
nal Commissioner." He said:
President Roosevelt recognized he could do
no.bettir than follow the pace set by our City
In the selection of the Panama Canal Com
mission President Roosevelt has performed one

tion and his course will command the ap

politics. Our President's patriotism is univer
sally recognised. Â¦-Â».,*".
Toastmaster Phelan's introduction of
Chief Justice Beatty to the toast of
"The President" was followed by a
groat outburst of applause, with shouts
of "three cheers for Roosevelt"! re
peated in all parts of the assembly. At
the close of Justice Ueatty's forceful
address the entire audience rose and
drank the President's health. The
Chief Justice said among other things:
Other letters of regret and congratu
lation were read from Mayor Schmitz,
M. H. de Young and Otto von Geldern.
It had been intended to Have Gov
ernor Pardee respond to the toast
â¢â¢California." In his absence Frank D.
Short of Fresno was called upon and
responded in his usual happy style.

Palace Hotel. San Francisco. â
Mr. Grunnky Is well known for his modest
worth. He is a man who has been found faith
ful in'f-mall things and is now to be. given
charge of great thing?. The palm goes to the
man who deserves. (Applause.) I . have had
the honor to be associated with him in some of
his undertakings. He gave his valuable advice
and suggestions in the matter of our city char
ter. In the Important post of City Engineer he
planned and constructed a pystem of water
supply that contemplates bringing water from
the Sierras, and now he leaves us a perfected
fewer system, and in many other departments
are equal marks cf his competency and zeal.
. Mr. Phelan read the. following tele
graphic correspondence:
March 15. 19O4.
A grreat tribute of respect was paid
last night by nearly 300 leading San
Francisans to C. Ewald Grunsky. the
retiring City Engineer, whom Presi
dent Roosevelt has named as a mem
ber of the Isthmian Canal Commis
sion. The citizens* banquet to the new
Commissioner was one of the most en
thusiastic and successful testimonials
of esteem ever given to a citizen of
San Francisco. The address in Mr.
Grunsky's honor testified without ex
ception to his modest but eminent
worth and his thorough fitness for the
great work to which he has been
called. ' His own speech was short,
dealing pointedly with municipal
questions in which he was interested
while in office here and with the prob
lems to be inet at Panama. The ad
dress of the former City Engineer,
who is about to leave San Fmncisco
for Washington, â¢ was cheered to the
echo. i
The ballroom at the Palace Hotel,
where the - banquet was heltl/ was
handsomely decorated with palms for
the occasion, while color was given
to the tables 'by masses of brilliant
flowers. When the elaborate dinner
was dispatched James D. Phelan, the
toastmaster of the evening, began the
speaking, saying in part:
This is a spontaneous testimonial to Mr.
Grunsky (cheenÂ«), and no more genuine tribute
coufd be paid to a ritizen who in at once 1 so
modest and bo worthy. We are here not only
to honor our retiring City Knglneer. but to
thank the President of the United States <pro
lor.ued cheer*) for the honor he has conferred
on Wan Kranclsco in selecting one of our citi
zens to represent the Pacific Coast on the Isth
mian Commission. The wcrk of this board will
he one of the great achievements in the world's
history, a matter so important that it has
wisely been taken out of the realm of politics
and patronage. Â¦ . <

A short address was also delivered
by Henry Epstein on j "The German
Benevolent Society," in which the
speaker referred in feeling terms to
Commissioner Grunsky's # work for

. Such is the nobility of the great office to
which our friend, "the honored guest of this
occasion, has been called, anil such the broad
philanthropy of the great work In whose con
struction he Is to bear an honorable share. I
felicitate him and ourselves that he has re
ceived his appointment at the hands of a
President to whose patriotism, continuity of
purpose and executive force the Panama -canal,
when completed, will be, a perpetual memorial.
COMMERCE OF THE "' PACIFIC.
In all history the material progress of man
kind has depended upon the science of en
gineering. The engineer has been the pioneÂ«r
of civilization in all ages. To his genius and
knowledge we owe all the victories we have
achieved over time and space. The Iron ways
of overland commerce, which have "conquered
mountain ; barriers: the steamship, which pile's
across wide oceans "without missing one beat
of its Iron heart from shore to shore"; the
discovery and transmission of electrical -power,
with all other mastery of physical forces, are
due to the civil engineer. The summit of en
gineering triumph , will have been reached in
history with the completion of the Panama
canal. No other undertaking is comparable
with It in the magnitude of the difficulties to
be overcome, or fraught with greater blessing
tu mankind than the objects to be obtained by
its construction.
Coming nearer home the Panama canal will
give to the States of the Pacific Coast a closer
commercial intimacy with Europe and to the
people of the Atlantic Coast a better com
mercial relation with the Orient. Whether car
ried by land or 'by. sea the- Panama canal will
reduce the oost of- interstate transportation
and thus Identify the common interests of the
eastern and western portions of our country
and weld them Into closer commercial relation
ship.
It will turn the 'ace of industry from the
interior of our country to the eastward and
westward oceans which wash its shores. It
will increase the military and naval power
of our nation without increasing the mag
nitude Â¦ of our military Â¦ and naval establish
ments, and by thus augmenting our power
promote our influence In the councils of the
nations. In all these blessings to the world
and to the nation we will be full and free
partakers.
To our own commonwealth it will confer
the blessing of reducing the cost to us of all
our imports and Increasing the value of all
our exports/ by enforcing, cheap rates of trans
portation for both. It will make the freÂ»
highways of the ocean controlling factors In
thi commercial and industrial development of
our State. It will make San Francisco a port
of cheap tonnage and consequently a port of
distribution. These two factors He at the very
basis of all commercial creatness.
GAINS TO CALIFORNIA.
It cannot be otherwise than that the con
struction of the Panama canal is in the in
terest of mankind at large. And it is a well
grounded oslnion, interwoven with all tne
opinions of my mind, that whatever Is best for
humanity as a whole Is best for every separ
ate portion of the human family.
' The affirmative generalizations have far
reaching significance. All nations will be in
terested in its comDletion, because it will
draw them into closer relation, minimizing oc
casion for war by augmenting the value and
blessing of peace.
All Industry of all countries will partake
of its blessins:, because commerce is the hand
maiden, of industry and lies at the very basis
of its prosperity. It will expand the com
merce of the Pacific Ocean as by the touch
of magic by merging the tragic stage of the
world's commerce on the Atlantic with the
Isolation of tlie Pacific. It will contribute to
the awakening of the vast population of the
Orient by causing the spirit of modern progress
to move upon that dead sea of arrested de
velopment.
To our nation it will be a guarantee of
commercial primacy in the commerce >of the
Pacific Ocean. When we acquired possessions
in the Orient and assumed sovereignty over
8,000,000 of people we became a factor in all
meaningful movements among the nations of
the Orient. With the acquisition of Oriental
territory we assumed higher duties to ourselves
and broadened responsibilities to the world.
The acceptance of this new relation with the
Orient made the construction of the Panama
canal a national necessity.
If the construction of this waterway can, by
any possibility, work a hardship to any por
tion of the world, it will be because the por
tion injured seeks to perpetuate the advan
tages it enjoys at the expense of the highest
good of mankind. â¢ Â¦ - i .
But there are elements of certainty attend
ing thÂ» construction of the Panama, canal,
rising by contemplation even to the dignity of
infallibility. They may bÂ« called Into view
by negative and affirmative generalizations.
First, of the negative generalizations: It
cannot be possible that the emancipation of
ocean commerce from the slavery of seven
thousand milts of useless sea transportation
can be other than good to mankind.
Every object of commerce is enhanced in
value by reducing the cost of its movement
to final market.
