while drinking met three countrymen,

thousand dollars in a field near the State

to buy the box, offered J230 for it. The
stranger finally agreed to sell for $400 and
Zerba put up nine $20 gold pieces and
the other two men the balance.
The quartet went to the spot designated
and dug up a tin box. On the way back

CINCINNATI, Jj June - 2.â Miss Alice
Roosevelt' arrived 4 ' here to-day, attended
by her maid, for a visit of a week or"
longer, at "Rookwood," the . Longworth
home. In the absence of Mrs. Longworth;
who left a few days ago for a protracted
visit to her daughter. Countess de Cham
brun, in France, Mrs. Buckner Walling
ford, another daughter, and Nicholas
Longworth, Congressman from the Sec
ond District, are the hosts at "Rook
wood." Congressman Longworth met
Miss Roosevelt at Loveland. a station
about twenty miles out. and escorted her
to the city. .This evening a small dinner
party was given by Mrs. Wallingford and
Mr. Longworth for Miss Roosevelt.
To-morrow Congressman Longworth
and his guests will attend the Latonia
Derby, going. in a private trolley car.
Although the opinion is generally held
here that Miss Roosevelt and Congress
man Longworth are engaged to be mar
ried, it is not likely even if such is the
case that a formal announcement will be
made during this visit, owing to the ab
sence of Mr. Longworth's mother, whose
abrupt departure for Europe on the eve
of the visit of the President's daughter
occasions much comment.

Count Cassini was unable to do , more
than to give the President his own per
sonal opinions on the situation. The Em
bassador was deeply . touched by the .'sin
cere cordiality of ; his reception and - the
frank and friendly manner in . which tho
President spoke. He could not see. how
ever,. that . there was anything -in the
present situation, unfortunate; as it.un
doubtedly was. for his Government.' which
necessitated Russia's. suing for peace. A3
to : territory, he . pointed : out that -China
and I not Russia bad been the loser, for
even Port Arthur . was , held only > under
lease. :-: On the \u25a0 sea, Russia had nothing
more to lose, . he said.
I It ' was I the \u25a0 Embassador* a firm- opinion
that this, was not "the psychological mo
ment" in which to discuss peace with
Japan.
11 Whatever 'might be; the ultimate ; dccl-
Appreciating the natural feelings of the
Embassador oa such an occasion, the
President began the conversation by %.
frank personal expression of sympathy
for Count Cassini. alluding to'the severÂ©
strain under which he has been for the
past few days and deploring the terribls
loss of life and consequent sorrow caused
by the recent battle In the sea of Japan.
Without further preliminaries a general
and entirely Informal and personal con
versation on tho whole situation followed.
The President Informed the Embassa
dor that he earnestly hoped for an early
peace in the Far East, and that in ex
pressing this hope, he voiced not only his
strong personal sentiments and those of
his Government, but cc believed they
were held by all of the powers. His opin
ion was that It would be a mistake for
Russia to continue the war. In addition
to the suffering entailed by the naval con
flict be did not believe that Russia has
anything to win In prolonging hostilities.
The President did not enter into details,
but the personal character of the conver
sation and his long acquaintance with
Count " Cassini enabled him to spe&Jc
plainly regarding the decisive character
of the Japanese victories.
What Japan's probabls peace taams
would be the President was wholly un
able to say. but he dm not â¢ hesitate to
express the opinion that, difficult as these
conditions might prove la the light of
such a victory as that gained In the Ko
rean Straits, they would Increase In se
verity with every day that a state of war
continued. Unless Russia has substantial
hope of administering a decisive defeat, to
Japan in this war, the President believed.'
It would Inure to the interests of the St.
Petersburg Government to conclude peace

WASHINGTON. June Z-The President
to-day struck a blow for pearÂ© in the Fax
East. In conference at tha TVhltd Houso
thia afternoon with Count QÂ»*^iTtt. the
Russian Embassador. the President ex
pressed the earnest wish that Russia
would forthwith conclude peace with Ja
pan. Prolongation of the war. he believes,
will not result in victory for the Russian
arms and can only serve to increase Ja
pan's demands and render more difficult
the drafting of a treaty of peace which,
the Czar, as welJ^as the Mikado, can sign.
The President spoka. ha said, as the
friend of Russia no less than of Japan,
and on, behalf not only of thÂ© Washing
ton" Government, but In the Interest of
humanity. .Until his word* have reached
Tsaxskoe-Selo and have been communi
cated to Emperor Nicholas in the friend
ly . spirit In which : Â«-Â«y; were , v it er cd . the
effect cannot be estimated. Soon after
reaching his . embassy Count Casslni be
gan the preparation of a dispatch to hla
Government. -
. Neither at the "White Hous* nor at thÂ«
Russian embassy could a formal state
ment .regarding the conference be ob
tained. Throughout the diplomatic corps
there Is & strong hope that to-day's con
ference marked the first step toward
peace, but the general opinion Is that
weeks may elapse before even primary
negotiations can be begun. Diplomats ex
press the hope that Emperor Nicholas
will receive the President's words as the
counsel of that Government which has
for years been Russia's traditional friend.
and win weigh it accordingly.

the Equitable had no concern whatever,
and In many of them had lost money. He
justified his participation In such opera

said- had been circulated about him was
one to the effect that he had given this
dinner with the idea of getung the order
of the Legion of Honor from the French
Government. This decoration had, in
fact, been conferred upon him two years
before.
Hyde in his address Insisted that
there was not a single act^ throughout
his entire career with the society which
ins the subject of so much as just
criticism on the part of a fair-minded
man, with the possible exception of the
Cambon dinner, and that was a matter
of honest difference of opinion as to
business methods. He said that while

Leaving aside the questions of pre
paredness and superior conditions, the
superiority of the personnel fr^sh from
fifteen months' successful -campaigning
under all possible conditions, ; must :'be
taken into consideration. Many ascribe
the victory entirely 'to ..the superior
marksmanship of the Japanese. Togo,
realizing thatit would probably be nec
essary to fight in the-, open sea, gave
his crews long training in, firing during
rough weather, with a"*heavy wind
blowing and the ships rolling. When
the hostile fleets met the superiority of
the Japanese immediately became evi
dent. The pinking of battleships and
armored cruisers by shell fire testifies
to the deadly accuracy of the. Japanese
guns and destroys the^ theory that itHs

TOKIO, June 2.â The cardinal causes
of Rojestvensky's defeat have been the
subject of general discussion here. One
Japan est expert gives the following
analysis: "First; an- imperfect'recon

misleading intelligence; second, an im

- LOXDOX. June 2. â The Telegraph
publishes the following:
TOKIO, June 1. â A correspondent at
SaseJ>o sends the following brief tacti
ca.l summary of the naval battle:
"Acmiral Togo had never changed
hjs pjan of operations. He had always
waited in Tsushima Straits and lay
. there ready for three months. \u25a0
"Rojestvensky had sent scouting:
boats to the straits, but the Japanese
did not reveal their presence, for In a
certain - harbor they lay. completely
bidden from view. \u25a0
"The Russians feared the forts along
the coast of Tsushima Island and the
passag-e between Iki and Kuisha. . Ad
inira* Kamimura's squadron appeared
to the south of Rojestvensky and
â¢ chased "him without firing a shot.
"Then Togro's anS Kataokas' squad
ron" appeared to the north of the Rus
sians, >vho were r-ressed from, the
southwest and north and toward the
cast, wh^re Shimoncseki fortress is sit
uated. Rojestvensky. once enveloped,
*ecame th* object of a concentrated
Jire from tV.ree sides and tried to make
,a dash toward the Japanese main
.squadron -to the north, but this was j
hopeless."
. .Naval experts here regard the fol
lowing facts in connection with the
battle as striking:
First â The secrecy maintained by the
Japanese. Not even" the officers of the
ships of the. other squadrons knew the
"\pltico where Togo's main squadron lay
' harbored.-
Second â A night bombardment from
sunset on May 27 until 2 o'clock on the
morning ef May 28.
Third â The length of the battles. /
A special correspondent at the naval
' basÂ« at .Sasebo, wiring last evening,
Kays:
"Rojestvensky, who arrived here on
May 30, had "the frontal bone of his
f<srohe*d broken by a splinter of a
KheU. His chest and left thigh are also
sligluly wounded. He received medi
cal treutment at the naval hospital to
.djj*. and Is now out of danger."
â The casualties among the officers of
tlie Japan^ne fleet are less than twenty.
â¢ Tos<>'Â»Â» flag-Rtilp, the Mikasa, bore the
brunt et the Russian gunfire.
"No .other explanation exists of the
wholesale smash-up of such powerful
vessels. Projectiles can disable and dis
arm steel battleships, but can hardly sink
them.. Moreover, the spot was admirably
suited for 1 the use of the smallir craft.
Togo Is too astute not to have seen this
immediately. The Russians' only hope
lay in a strong wind, which might have
prevented the approach of the torpedo
fleet, at the same time making impossible
the manipulation/ of . submarines arid
sweeping . away the fog. This hope was
not realized, and the helpless vessels be
came the prey of .the Japanese."
Togo's greatest claim to fame, accord
ing to Admiral Fournler. will be the fact
that he was the first, naval leader in the
world to demonstrate beyond doubt the
tremendous efficacy of .submarines. ,* /
PARIS, June 2.â "Until otherwise offi
cially assured, our opinion will be that
the destruction of the Russian fleet .was
due to the submarines," said Admiral
Fournler, epeaking in' the name of the
leading spirits of the French navy. "The
battle in the sea of Japan," he contin
ued, "was no struggle between squadrons
capable of easily maneuvering : and in
flicting mutual damage on. each other. It
was simply a powerful attack on the
Russian fleet by a swarm of torpedo
boats and submarines. ' f
LOS ANGELES, June 2.â Los Angeles
has declared positively,. against prohibi
tion. By a vote of 15,270t0 5766 the voters
put the" stamp "of ' their Jdisappf oval upon
a proposed ordinance which within ninety
days would have -closed' every saloon, in

which they used 1 freely; they conducted
a 'campaign which will not soon be for

, On -the other slcle the prohibition forces
were not without expert political assist

had funds ln^abundance and they did not:
scruple to use their money to ; induce per
sons to enter "their enemy/a camp to se

It was admitted by, them that^ if they
were winners in" to-^dayjsi fight they would
carry the antl-salbon fight. Into other
fields.;. The success practically.of;the.en
'tife nb-salbon movement throughout this
section of the Sta\e centered in. to-day's

That there ,v/as not â¢ the ; slightest dis-^

the saloons-Vwere closed and hot a drop.
Of liquor was "sold from ahyj>f Jhem. The
saloon men ; had been charged to see that;
no disorder^ occurred "and on 'the

corraled every horse and' buggy which;
could bo hired in this and neighboring;
towns . and ,when \ the prohibition â. forces

v A feature of ; the election was the work |
of women at the polls, "but they received
so little support that ; they soon left and,
repairing to the churches, many;of them*
spent the day in a service of prayer for
the success of the prohibition movement.
The attitude of the business men more
than anything else caused the defeat of,
th'c prohibitionists, : for almost ; to a man
they openly declared themselves opposed;
to the movement. ' .-," Under Ine * Initiative ;

tionists can have anouer election called !

ST. PETERSBURG, June 2.â The
Russian press -this morning 1 still is ad
vocating more vigorously than ever the
summoning:-; of ! a national assembly,
even the reactionary'Sviet"- joining an
the general' chorus. In view of the cur

the papers â¢which are more or less in
the confidence of the Government
unanimously take the position that rep
resentatives of the people should de
cide the question of peace or war.
' All censorship is ' now removed , f#om
foreign dispatches and the people/ are
appalled' at " the horrible stories of
slaughter on board the Russian ships.
The Admiralty has not yet been able\to
estimate; even approximately from the
foreign advices the loss of men, but as
the ships were over, rather than.under
manned, the. total will be . greater than
the ordinary' complement of the ves
sels would indicate, and probably will
exceed 10,000 If only. about 4000 ..were

WASHINGTON, Jdne 2.â Th,e designa
tion by Judge William B. Gilbert of the
Ninth Circuit Court of Judge de" Haven
of the Northern District Of . California as.
Presiding Judge in the trial of the land,
fraud cases >in Oregon has led to some
embarrassment among officials here.
. The recent death of Judge .Bellinger,
who was to have tried these cases, caused
a vacancy in the Oregon district. '*
It practically' has been determined by
the President and Attorney General that
Judge Hunt, United States Judge; of the
District of Montana, should succeed:
Judge Bellinger in the trials and \u25a0 that
â¢the appointment of Judge Bellinger's suc
cessor should not be made immediately.
At this point Judge Gilbert, exercising
authority which' he supposed be- had.- di
rected that Judge de Haven? should '\u25a0. try
the cases. ' '
This was displeasing to officiate: of the
Department of Justice.' and a telegram
was sent to Judge Gilbert by Attorney
General Moody inquiring by what author
ity he had directed that Judge de Haven
Should try the cases.
Thus far no reply has been received to
that telegram! What the result of tho
situation will be' is uncertain-, and wheth
er the action of Judge, Gilbert will bo
overruled may depend on the .reply he
makes to the Attorney General's inquiry.

GOVERNMENT PAKTY
BEATEN IN ENGLAND
As 'was stated by the president' of the board
to one of the deposed officials, there was a
'"turn of the political wheel." This turn was
th* costrollng reason for the changes, even
though thÂ« members of the board made at the
same time have felt that they were promoting
efficiency and economy In the managemnt of
the department.
The foregoing discussion proceeds ' upon the
ground that the Board of Health bad not power
to fill places occupied by civil service employe*
exoept by means of requisition upon the Board
of Civil Service Commissioners for names of
eligible* from the classified list. For the de
termination of this question. It Is Immaterial
whether or not . the incumbents were properly
removed. It la not intended therefore in this
opinion to decide the question, which was
quite -fully argued, whether or not the persons
displaced held at the pleasure of the appoint
ing pow^r pursuant to article 20. section 16
of the constitution. Whether they did or not.
It was incumbent upon the Board of Health in
filling tb*ir places to make the appointments
in tha manner laid down in the civil service
article of the charter.
For the foregoing reasons the preliminary
injunction asked for will Issue upon the plain
tiff filing an \u25a0 undertaking . In the sum of $1000
and the demurrer will be /overruled with leave
to answer within ten days.
As all of the evidence in the case was
taken upon the hearing of the demurrer
Interposed by the defendants, the .right
given the defendants by the court to an
swer the complaint is a negative one. for
the case now stands upon, its
merits.- So nothing remains to the defend
ants but to appeal, though it Is generally
held that such action would avail them
not.
POLITICAL WHEEL TURKS.
Notwithstanding the fact that the deputy
h tilth officer, nominally at least, took the
places of four or five of the old employes, cir
cumstances surrounding the meeting of the
board at which the changes were made go far
to demonstrate that the majority of the board
was reeking to displace subordinates who were
for personal or political reasons not agreeable
to them, and to substitute another or others
to place them better. The control of the board
had jnst paced from the adherents of one po
litical party to those of another, and It was evi
dently thought desirable to give certain places
of employment to followers of the domlnent
faction. \u25a0.-..-.\u25a0
The plaintiff's contention la that these pow
ers of abolition and creation, while necessarily
renting In the discretion of the board, mast
be exercised in quod faith for thÂ« public serv
ice, and, cannot be made a cloak lor the par
pose of Evading a provision of the charter rela
tive to the appointment of persons In the classi
fied civil service list of the city and county.
In other words, if the real purpose of the board
was to remove certain employes and to replace
them with others, this object, which could
not be directly accomplished without violating
the provisions of the charter, was not capable
of fulfilment by the device of abolishing one
place and creating another with substantially
the same duty and giving It a new title. And
this contention is abundantly sustained by
authorities.
In hi* oolnlon Juiljf SloÂ«s â¢boivÂ« the
fullest coutfiupi for. the contention of
the Health Board that the chance of of
ficial* was made in the Interest of econ
omy. He finds this contention to be
naught bat a political snbterf. ujre to re
ward those who aided thp administra
tion in attaining; dominance and to re
liukr those who joined their fortunes
\u25a0nith the defeated parties. He also find*
that the board did not exercise good
faith, but by poorl> d Ingrained evnsioa
sought to override the orjjanlc law of
the city.
In his opinion Judge. Sloss says in
part:
A POLITICAL SUBTERFUGE.
The men illegally appointed were Louis
Levy, who was given the title of Deputy
Health Inspector, succeeding Secretary
James A. Emery, and Drs. C. A. Glover.
C. W. Goodale, M. J. Walsh and J. M.
Hannah, who were decorated as inspect
ing physicians, succeeding sanitary in
spectors provided "for in the charter.
These were R. E. Hartley and John
Green. Levy was to be paid 5150 a month
during the first six months of his employ
ment and 5175 thereafter, while the phy
sicians were each to receive $100 monthly.
Before they could reach the treasury,
however, Quinn filed his suit, and Judge
Sloss has decided against them. As a
temporary injunction was issued against
the Auditor when the suit was filed, the
illegally appointed officials have not
drawn a dollar frcm the treasury, nor
will they receive a dollar for their eight
een months' service if Judge Sloss' deci
sion is upheld by the Supreme Court.
Whether or not the officials illegally re
moved to make way for those appointed
are entitled to the salaries attaching to
the offices is a question that must.be de
cided by further litigation.
The Scnmitz administration has met
deelÂ«lve> defeat tn Its effort to irreclc the
civil service ncheme of tbc charter. The
defeat for the administration was con
tained tn a decUlon handed down yeÂ»
terday moraine by Judge Sloss in the
â¢ntt bronjcht by John E. Quinn, former
Civil Service Commissioner and a di
rector of the Merchants' Association.
The suit rvaÂ« brought to restrain tbc
Auditor from puÂ»Â»liig the demands upon
the treasary of employes of the Board
of Health irbo fvere put In office after
the fllegml removal of civil service ap
pointees whose political affiliations
were unsatisfactory to the dominant
parry.

Officers were awaiting to take him* back

Bams years ago Hope, after getting free

ten years In prison, but he *nd bis com

term of service before they escaped. From
that time on Hope was continually want

captured and sentenced, but as frequent

the Manhattan Bank of New York and

of the plunder was In registered securi

this affair. Again the veteran thief went
to prison, but made his escape, and the
next heard from him was when he was
captured In this city while attempting to
rob the Sather Bank on Montgomery
street. He was sentenced to ten years
In San Quentin. He was released, after ;
serving seven years and six months, on
November IS. ISS6.\
Hope was bom in Philadelphia and en
tered upon his criminal career at an early
age. One of his early exploits was ths
cracking of the safe of the Plymouth
Bank in Philadelphia. Although he was
not arrested for the crime, the suspicion
was strong against him.* Later he robbed

PITTSBURG. June 2.â Fire, due prob
ably to crossed wires, broke out in the
Avenue Theater shortly before 4 o'clock
this afternoon while a large audience was
in the playhouse- Before It was subdued
it completely destroyed the theater and
partly, wrecked the Grand Opera-house.

and no lives were lost. The loss will reach

The' jurors expressed themselves as
Â£r:xious to hear from John C. Driseoll.
former secretary of the Coal Team Own
ers'- Association, who was declared by
Shea and Young to have been present at
the time of the offering of the alleged
bribe. Driseoll. however, could not be
found In the city, although deputy sher
iffs have searched for him for the greater
fart of two days.
The members of the teamsters' joint
council will to-morrow afternoon at 2
o'clock inform Mayor Dunne of their
f.r.al decision regarding the proposition of
the Team Owners' Association to arbi
trate the Question cf deliveries to the
boycotted houses. It was proposed to-day
that this matter be left to a committee of
seven representing the teamsters and a
like number acting for tne owners' asso
ciation. This was declined by the team
sters, and they said they would consider
the matter, promising to make a final de
cision by to-zacrrow afternoon.
With the team owners making deliv
eries to boycotted houses, the teamsters
would face* the alternative of calling off
the strike or seeing It spread to 9000 more
. The demands of the members of the
Team Owners' Association for arbitration
cf the question whether or not deliveries
should be made to the boycotted houses
ha? been "referred to the members of tfie
Truck Drivers' Union. At a meeting of
the Teamsters' Joint Council it was de
cided that ihe members of the union,
â¢which is largely employed by the mem
bers of the Team Owners' Association.
should decide the matter for themselves,
the officials of the Teamsters' Union de
clining the issue.
No meeting of the Truck Drivers' Union
will be held before next Tuesday and the
demand of the Team Owners' Association
will remain unanswered until that time.
The teamsters employed by the Parme
lee Transfer Company, which operates tne
omnibus lines between the railroad sta
tions and the principal hotels and does the
greater part of the baggage transfer busi
ness of the city, have by a referendum
vote decided not to strike. They had
Eafle a demand for an increase of pay.
but it was Refused and the old wage
scale offered.

could not be ascertained. It was report
ed, however, that bills would be voted In
connection with the charge made by
President Shea cf the Teamsters' Union
that he was offered $10,000 to call a strike
against Sears, "Roebuck & Co.. The stat
ute of limitations may bar such lndict
ttentsy however, and the evidence given
was largely of hearsay character. It was
.rumored that some Indictments would be
â¢based en the charge of conslpracy to In
jure the business of a number of large
concerts, and it was also said that some
Indictments would be found for perjury.
There was nothing definite, however. In
any of those statements.
' Robert J. Thome, general manager for
"Montgomery Ward & Co., was before the
Grapd Jury this afternoon, and while
â¢denying absolutely all knowledge of the
SiO.OCO sal a to have been offered to Shea
.and other labor leaders, declared that he
â¢did not even know Shea at the time the
Alleged offer cf $10,000 was made. He said
fee first met Shea in April, 1305. and be
fore that time had never seen nor spoken
to him. This evidence is in direct opposi
tion to that offered by Shea and Albert

BERKKLEY, June 2.â rA conference
committee of the improvement clubs of

of Education be asked to devise a plan
for the appointment of school teachers
on a civil service basis. Instead of by
the method now employed. It Is de
clared, apropos of the dismissal of Mrs.
Mary Wilson from the department last
Wednesday night, that autocratic power
Is exercised by the School Board,
wrongf ully at times, and that* the inter
ests of the schools, the teachers and the
public would be better served if a civil
service basis was used for teachers'
appointments. The plan was discussed
at length by the committee and at a
meeting to be held next Friday definite
action is to be taken and recommenda
tions prepared for submission to the

If Mrs. Richards is still a wife she
cannot, in the eyes of the law, prose
cute Richards on the complaint she has
sworn out. If she is not a wife, so far
as the purposes of this case go she can
maintain her action.
OAKLAND. June 2.â Police Judge
Mortimer Smith has under advisement a
knotty point, growing out of the new
divorce law. It involves a decision
whether Harry Richards, a vocalist of
this city, can be prosecuted by Mrs.
Richards on a charge of threatening
her with violence. Richards procured
an interlocutory decree of divorce from
his" wife several months ago. The year
has not elapsed that is required before
the anal decree can b* taken. Judge
Smith was not positive to-day as to
Mrs. Richards' legal status when Rich
ards' case was called and he continued
the- matter until Monday to consider it;
On the other hand, Attorney A., F. St.
Sure and George W. Reed showed by the
testimony of the elder McDonell and cer
tain circumstances tending to corroborate
his story that the old man was inveigled
into. giving away a valuable estate, to one
nephew while he believed that he was
dividing it equally among a number of
relatives. The property Is valued at $18,
000, and with the conclusion of taking the
testimony the matter was submitted
without argument, briefs, however, to be
filed by both sides.
Â» \u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0
OAKLAND, June 2. â It was left
to Judge -W. H. West to-day to
pick out t the false from the : true
in the \u25a0 testimony .given â; before him
in a suit brought ;'â¢ to enforce a
deed to twenty-one acres of valuable veg
etable land on Bay* Farm Island deeded
by aged P. A. McDonell to his nephew,
Edward McDonell. The old man on the
stand to-day denied that when he signed
the deed he knew that it was a deed he
was slÃTiing. ffnd stated that he sup
posed it was a will.
In. direct contradiction to this was the
testimony of the nephew and also of Sen
ator M. ,W, Simpson of Alameda, who
drew ud the deed. They testified that
when McDonell signed the instrument he
was asked if he knew what he was sign
ing. ' He Vas Informed that it was a gift
deed to Sthe property and that he /was
giving it to his â¢ nfcphew. Corroborative
testimony was also given by Judge R, B.
Tappan, who stated that he afterward
talked with McDonell about the deed.
PLIGHT TROTH
UNDER BOWER
OF BLOSSOMS
It came out In the evidence given that
Hynes drew the will for the late
Charles B. Slicer and also that Victory
had obtained knowledge of the contents
of the will, and when' pressed for. his
source of information said that, his wife
had been told by some of Hynes' rela
tives. The word soon, got to Hynes and
then there was trouble, and as soon as
Victory left the witness stand he was
accosted by Hynes, who told him that
he had lied. The Deputy District Attor
ney proposed to make him make a re
traction of what he had said, when the
words and demonstrations caused the
several bystanders .to get ; between the
angry men and separate them.""
'OAKLAND. June 2.â There was a tor
rential flow of wrath when Deputy Dis
trict Attorney W. H. L. . Hynes learned
to-day that J. J. Victory, a .witness in
the Slicer will contest now. on trial,, had,
testified that through^ the women folk
of the Hynes household the women folk
contents; of Slicersi will a few; days
after , it had been signed. As soon, fas
court adjourned Hynes sought Victory
out andit needed the combined efforts
of Deputy Sweeney and several spec
tators to restrain Hynes from making a
rough and tumble attack with Victory.

The. strong wind that prevails during *
the f ummer creates what, to a tiny '
craft like a sailing canoe, is a pretty j
heavy sea. The ardent canoeist, in j
wateris such as these, must be prepared!
/or a ducking, for circumstances max 1
occur which render It almost impos- j
slble to avoid being capsized.
No aquatic sport calls for greater j
quickness, readiness and knowledge^of ,
navigation than canoe-sailing. In a|
large, abltf yacht an error may be at- j
tended by rio ec-rious consequences, but'
the man who makes a mistake In '
handling a canoe in a stiff breeze and j
lumjy water turns his craft over and j
goes into the "water himself.
The Oakland canoeists, besides cruis- j
ing in the \u25a0waters of Oakland Creek I

to Belvedere, Bay Farm Island, the j
' Union Iron Works and the -headquar- j
ters'of the Enclnal' Yacht Club on the \u25a0
Alameda shore of the bay. On. public.;
holidays races are held over a triangu- j
\zr course for the Holiday Cup.
" Several members of the Enclnal
Tacht i Club are enthusiastic canoeists ;
and in Tiburon Cove and neighboring
waters thÂ« canoe-owning members of .
tÂ£e Olympic-Boat Club flna their pleas
ure. Two or three sailing canoes are '
kept in. the. boat-house of the San
Francisco "Yacht" Club at Sausa'ito.
â¢ Paddling canoes of the Indian birch- :
bark type are occasionally used at
Belvedere. These are seen chiefly In
the mornings before the wind has be
g Tin to. blow strongly, or toward the
close of the yacbting season, in Sep
tember, when the breeze becomes much
lighter. On aquatic sports days, which
the San Francisco Yacht Club holds in
July and October, there is usually a
raoe for "sailing canoes.
The headquarters of canoeing on the
Bay oâ¬*San Francisco are to be found
on Sessions Basin. Easj Oakland,
Where the boat-house of the Oakland
Canoe Clut> stands. From the begin
ning of May to the end of October the
Canoeists pursue their favorite sport,
which, even on the sheltered and com
paratively calm waters of Oakland
Creek, Is often a somewhat strenuous'
one.
t So many good lacrosse players live in

so necessary for the maintenance of

The Los Angeles list of entries was
not as large as expected, but shows an
average of nearly eleven for each, event.
This- should result in good fields of
starters. The 2:09 class pace has seven
of the fastest side wheelers on the coast

is the horse the winner will have to

are Zolock 2:09%. Kelly Brings 2:09%.
Alone' 2:o9%. Le Rol 2:10%. 1ra* 2:19%
and Jonesa Busier 2:11%. Daedalion
beat Kelly Briggs last year at Santa
Rosa, and " there was much talk ' of &
$2000 match between' the two 'this
spring, but it never got beyond talk.' If
both start at the Los Angeles meeting
it should be a fight to a' finish and' one"
of the best betting races seen there In'

For the first time In years a California
bred tbnee-year-old has been sent East to
compete against the. best colts and fillies
of Us age in the Kentucky $20,000 Futurity,
the richest of all statoes for three-year
old trotters. The filly Bonnie Me. bred
and owned by W. H. Lumsden of Santa,
Rosa, is to carry. California's color* In tha
great event this year, and she gives e,very .
promise of proving eaual to the .ordeal.
Bonnie Me is by Charles Griffiths" great
pacer Bonnie Direct, ZiC&i. the champion
of. his day. Her Jam is that popular old
mare Myrtle, t:l3Vi. by Anteeo. .
! it was back In 2Â£Â» that two fflUes. _
Myrtle and Vlda WIIKes, started in the.
Occident Stake at Sacramento. Myrtle
was named in the race by her breeder,
the late Isaac De Turfc of, Santa Rosa.'
while Vlda Wilkes was the representative
of the famous Corbett'farm at San Ma
teo. Myrtle was handled by "Bill* Me-
Graw of Silas" Skinner fame, while the
late John Goldsmith held the ribbons over
Vlda Wlikes. The â¢ wise money was aU
down on Vida. and at odds of .four and
three to* one, poured Into the pool box.
while the "grape pickers'- from Sonoma :
County quietly took the other end. It :
was easy for Myrtle,' and she won in
ithree straight heats. She art f* a JfT''
times the next year, but was retired with
I a "leg." and placed In the brood-mare^
ranks.' ." . . ---..ââ¢ â¢
She then became the property oC Mr.
Lumsden, who patched her up in 1599.
when she was 11 years old, and started
her in- a race at Santa Rosa. She reeled
off a mile in 2:13%. knocking six seconds
from her former mack, and was then re
tired to the farm to spend the balance ot
her days as a matron. She is the dam
of that fast trotter Rofcigola. 2:12^. â¢eh.
Mlllard Sanders raced on the Grand Cir
cuit two years ago.
Her three-year-old daughter. Bonnie
Me. will add further to her reputation
as a producer of speed. Bonnie , Me
trotted a mile in 2:22 last April with a
half in 1:05% and a quarter m 32% *
seconds. This seems marvelous speed
for one of her age so early in the year,
but she will have to trot much faster
to win, as the Kentucky Futurity is gen
erally a record breaker.
j Last year Grace Bond won it ana her
winning heats were 2:09%. 2:03% and
2:09? i. In 1904 Sadie Mac carried off
the big end of the purse, 2:12% belns
her fastest heat, and the year bef orej
Nella Jay won with 2:14% tbe best^
time.
...Bonnie Me will meet the pick of the
.three-year-old ' trotters 'of ''America J in
this race. She "will be driven" Uy ' Ed
Benyon, the Kentucky trainer, who has
a reputation" for -winning, biff ..colt
stakes. Bonnie Me -reached Lexington.?
last week and will be given a. careful,
preparation for "the" race, which comes
off in September. Among the. "other ,
starters will be "W. A. Clark's" Kentucky ,
bred colt Bon Voyage, which won, the.
two-year-old division last year.. driven
by .Charles Marvin. . Bon Voyage has
wintered at Los Angeles in charge of
Ted Hayes. His record Is 2:15 as , a
two-year-old. .
Lou Dillon is billed to start for Cleve
land on Monday. .She win probably have
her last work-out *hia morning at San
Jose. She has been taking her fast exer
cise on Tuesdays and 'Saturdays during
the past two months before admiring
crowds who visit Agricultural Park In taÂ«
Garden. City especially to see the trotting
queen in action. \u25a0_\u0084..

NEW-YORK SELECTIONS.
Eddie Hanlon _ went _ into the ring at
Woodward's Pavilion a pronounced 9
to 10 choice, to the surprise of the bet
ting men. , In all' the betting done up
to yesterday the Denver' boxer was an
8 to 10^. favorite.. _This..was the opening
price yesterday, but it went quickly to
even money. The flood of Hanlon
money was not balanced by the - Cor
bett end and the: Calif ornian was soon
a 9 to 10 and then. an B , to 10 favorite.
It is presumed that the bettors based

Corbett did not have the sharp, snappy
vigor, to his blows which marked his last
fight with Hanlon or, bis memorable : one
with Terry McGovern in Mechanics* Pa-
Tlllon. He landed .; some straight to the
head and , to the body, but the stopping
power, was .not .there. Hanlon was .also
at fault In this part of the game, as some
The fight was still raging fiercely
when the gong sounded the end of the
Struggle. Referee Homan at once
placed, his hand on Hanlon, declaring
him the victor. Young Corbett stood
near the center of the ring for an in
stant as if stupefied at the outcome and
then suddenly struck the referee a
hard blow with his right hand. The
- blow caught the referee almost on the
point of the Jaw. It came before he had
any opportunity to defend himself, and
JiÂ® staggered back limply until the
ropes stopped his progress. By this
- time the seconds had rushed Into the
: ring and bustled the boxers to their
corners. Referee Homan collected his
scattered senses and rushed across the
ring at Corbett, but the police and the
seconds stopped any further trouble.
Aa usual after a fight like this, there
was a difference of opinion among
the spectators as to the justness of the
referee's decision. Last night many ex
pressed the opinion freely that Homan
was -unduly Influenced by Hanlon's sen
sational work In the last round. They
held 'that a fight which goes the limit
must be decided on boxing points, and
that, taking the fight round for round, a
draw would have been a just decision.
There were the ardent supporters of
.each man, who claimed that the fight
could have been given to their man, and
they had arguments with wiÂ«ch to back
up their contentions. One thing the fight
'demonstrated was that neither man in his
present form has a chance In a bout of
any length with Jimmy Britt. The final
round gave the renewed strength adage,
"'.Youth will be served." Hanlon, despite
all the desperate encounters in which he
has taken part In tne last few years,
*J>owed that his powers v of recuperation
have been but slightly impaired. While
ll seemed for several rounds that Inevi
table defeat stared him in the face, na
ture came to his rescue and his fighting
power gradually came back to him. The
reverse in the situation was so marked
.and so sudden as to take the spectators
completely by surprise when Hanlon
showed he was still full of fight. The old
power was r.^t there when Corbett needed
it most.' Corbett's best blow throughout
the fight was a right to the head, which
he seemed able to get past Hanlon's
guard on many occasions. Corbett ? did :
all the leading, while Hanlon, who is es
eentially an Inflghter, did his best work
when they stood head to head - and ex
changed blows. Hanlon devoted much
attention to his opponent's body, and In
the early stages of the fight did his most
effective work there.
â¢ Hanlon showed his remarkable strength
6everal times by the manner in which
he shoved Corbett away, sometimes send
'lng him nearly half-way across the ring.
Corbett opened up the nineteenth with
'one right-hand blow to the head after
another. They did not seem to stop
.Hanlon, who came back with right and
left to the body repeatedly. Xear the end
of the round the spectators began to set
UP the cry of "Hanlon! Hanlon! Hanlon."
Corbett's friends tried to start a counter
demonstration, but they were drowned
out by the volume of sound of the Hanlon
sympathizers.
, Hanlon came up fresh for the twen
tieth and last round and fought as
if he was just starting out on the long
trip. He never gave Corbett a mo
ment's rest, but rushed him all over
the ring. He landed rights and lefts,
and staggered Corbett several times.
The latter was never able to set hlm
Â«elf, and hardly landed a clean blow
throughout the round. It seemed his
.vitality, which had stayed with him up
to that point, had suddenly ebbed
awiiy and left him almost helpless in
the hands of Hanlon.
BATTLE RAGED TO THE EXD.
HAXI,OX SHOWS STKEVGTH.
-After twenty rounds of earnest fighting
in Woodward's Pavilion last night Eddie
Hanlon turned the table on his former
-opponent, Toung Corbett, and was award
ed the palm of victory by Referee Ed
]{oman. While the fight was common
place and spectacular by turns few of the
spectators will ever forget the sensational
manner In which it wound up.
Up to the eighth round neither had
shown much class and the. fight did not
promise much. In the eighth Hanlon had
a decided lead and from that until the
eleventh it seemed the Californian would
score a decisive victory by the knockout
route. They had been fighting for about
half o* the eleventh round when Corbett
sent a snappy right-hand to the jaw
wtiich, although it traveled but a few
\u25a0Inches, caught Hanlon on the vital spot
and he went to his knees. Corbett was
aimost as much surprised as any one in
the house at the effectiveness of the blow.
Hanlon took -eight seconds on the floor
and when he stood up he was in a bad
way. Corbett saw his advantage and
'went at Hanlon viciously in an attempt
.to stop proceedings then and there. Han
lon was able to stay the round out, and
his seconds worked over him with tre
mendous energy in the one minute rest.
When he came up for the twelfth round
his head had not cleared and he held on
to avoid punishment. Corbett suddenly
seemed to recover all his old form and
went at Hanlon at a hot pace. He rushed
him about the ring and landed some hard
left swings to the jaw and uppercut him
repeatedly. Hanlon was game but tired,
and put vp as clever a defensive battle
as he knew how. From that point up to
near the end of the sixteenth round Cor
tiett was complete master of the situa
tion. He landed all manner of blows on
.Hanlon, but the one-time decisive punch,
which was his chief stock in trade,
itemed to be missing. Near the end of
the sixteenth round Hanlon swung on
Corbett and staggered him. In the seven
teenth Hanlon seemed to have recovered
some of his vitality and landed a lot of
lilows on Corbett. but they were all pal
pably weak. Hanlon kept up his speed
in the eighteenth, but Corbett never gave
way an inch, and they stood in the center
of the ring head to bead, like a pair of
game chickens, and exchanged blow for
blow.
In the seventh round they were clinched
for a time and each was - swinging in
overhand blows, which did no damage.
Hanlon landed a right and a left to the
body and Corbett came back with a hard
right to the body. Corbett's nose com
menced to bleed in this round, while Han
lon's right eye began to appear puffy.
Hanlon swung a hard right at Corbett in
the eighth which caught him on the back
of the head and staggered him. They
again assumed their favorite position of
head to head and slugged away .merrily."
Hanlon tried a right swing, which went
wide of its mark. The ninth and tenth
rounds were full of fight. It was in the
eleventh that Corbett turned the tide of
defeat that seemed to be setting in stead
ily against him. Early in the round Han
lon rushed his antagonist to the ropes
and landed right and Jeft to head and
body often. - Corbett missed two swings
and then sent a right to the head. Han
lon came back with a right to the head,
which staggered Corbett.
Just after this Corbett topped in a
right to the jaw. which dropped Hanlon
to his knees. The blow dazed the Cali
lornlan. and he was able to make but a
poor stand up to the . seventeenth round.
In this Corbett seemed to have gone back
suddenly, although he took most of Han
lon's blows smilingly. Hanlon improved
slowly but steadily until the last round,
when he was much the fresher of tne
two. Hanlon was ably handled by Spider
Kelly, Toby Irwin and Frank McDonaFd.
In Corbett's corner were Tim McGratli,
George Herbert and Dave Barry.
\u25a0 Rufe Turner, Al Arens and Britt were
presented to the spectators. There were
loud calls for Jeffries, but if the world's
champion was in the house he kept his
presence a secret. "
Corbett contented himself with jabbing
Hanlon in the third round and took a
hard right to the head in a clinch. Both
scored hard rights to the head in the
fourth and Hanlon landed two lefts to tne
head which hurt Corbett Both were
fighting fiercely when the end of the
round came. Early in the fifth round
they stood head to head and slugged for
some seconds., Corbett missed a vicious
uppercut after jabbing Hanlon several
time 3 with his left. Hanlon -locked two
right swings that would have damaged
him had they landed. Corbett landed his
right on the body five times without a
return early in the sixth round and was
then staggered with a right to the head.
He came back with two to the body.
Hanlon scored one right uppercut and
missed another.
The referee wa3 not gentle in his han
dling of the men, as he broke them apart
roughly, shoving each away at different
stages of the fight. He" favored neither
man In this regard, but did not interfere
with their fighting tactics. There was
no decisive blow struck in the first round,
but in the second Hanlon raised the hopes
of his friends by rushing Corbett to the
ropes and landing right and left to the
head and body. Hanlon snowered many
blows on Corbett and got two hard right
uppercuts in return. At the bell Hanlon
shook up Corbett with a hard right to
the head. . .
of the blows he landed on Corbett should
have put the latter out of commission.

Mr. Carnegie has determined to apply part, of ; his- wealth 40 the
creation of a technical school at Pittsburgh that is JhtVnded to be
the greatest in the world. He. has already' devoted $25,000,000 to
that purpose. In the school, every branch of science as applied to

â¢ The interpretation of the ukase according to the Minister is
that it granted the right of petition only to individuals. Organized
institutions are told they must confine themselves to the local ques
tions over which they have jurisdiction. By this restriction of the
right of petition, the chance of getting a forceful request, that
showed on its face to be representative of popular desire, brought
to the attention of the Emperor is taken away; and taking that as
a sample of the way things are done by the Government in Russia,
it is easy to infer that several other nominally granted reforms may
prove to be empty promises, given out because the Emperor was
â¢ nervous, and the Ministers wanted the revolutionary inclined to be
kept calm for a 1a 1 Httie while, until the Government's powers of
coercion were more to be/ depended upon.
, r T?HE Russian Minister of the Interior, Bulighin, has issued a
J "circular affirming that discussions about modifying the form
â¢-* <qf"the Russian Government are not warranted by the ukase of
AJarch 3, granting to the people the privilege of petition. Presuming
on; that ukase, the conference of delegates from all the zemstvos,
â¢ which has been in session in -Moscow, has tried to form a plan of
â¢representative institutions which would be best adapted to their
Â§â¢ country. It assumed that the right of petition would carry with it
naturally the right to meet and discuss and formulate the subjects
to" petition about. The action of the Czar's Minister defeats the
â¢ project of getting a collective petition in such shape as would' Tep
v se'sent "the definite wishes of a large body of his subjects, and so
virtually 'takes away with one hand what was given with the other.
Yhe. gagging of the conference looks suspiciously like a proof that
f # t.Kc offer of partial freedom to the people was only a temporary
expedient of conciliation. Either that, or else the Czar can practi
â¢ caflty be balked of his good intentions by the schemes of his Min
isters.
THE CZAR'S PROMISES.
INCIDENT to the general movement for shortening the working
\u0084day,-the, day, -the employing printers of this city and their employes en
tered into a sliding scale agreement which reached equilibrium
at an eight-hour day and $20 per week minimum wage. This ad-
Piting process began at a nine-hour day and $18 minimum wage.
The employers explain/ in "A Plain Statement of Facts/ which
we publish in another column, that when this adjusting process be
gan in_ 1903 it was expected by them that their Eastern competitors
t would' begin and complete a similar adjustment with their em
ployes, so that the commercial printing trade in the whole country
would be upon an equality in wages and hours. As is shown, this
"has not been done, and as a result their Eastern competitors have
/an advantage of 25 per cent in the cost of output.- This situation
- has caused a discussion of a readjustment back to equality of con
- 'ditions with the Eastern employers. \u25a0 ;
*; /â¢ Jt is conceded by economists that the former- long-day -for labor,
t>y which we do not mean the nine-hour day merely, but the much
'longer day which preceded it, caused a limitation of output through
ks- moral and physical injury to workingmen. j The long day by no
. means meant a long output, nor did it mean the highest, excellence
of* (he product. As the day was shortened a distinct economic gain
â¢â¢â¢appeared and, of more importance, there was a gain in the physique
..." and the morale of lab/>r. We believe there is no dispute of these
, 'results of a 'shorter Say. All systems go to judgment on their
results, their effect upon the welfare of man. Hence it is that the
snort day is affirmed and that it has come to stay. Between it and
* tl}e long day there is a flexible space, a ground for discussion and
.compromise, at piece worl>, in such trades as can be subjected to
i that plan, but that need not be discussed here. .
As the short day is justified by results, and takes on the nature
. of those reforms that do not go backward, <tt is a cause for anxiety
and disquiet that the expectation of our employing printers that it
would become general has not so far been realized, and that their
, adjustment to it gives to their competitors an advantage. Employ
ing and operative printers are both highly intelligent. Contact with
'that Jrade enhances the intelligence required to embark in it. The
â¢-employes having done their part in the agreement of adjustment
cannot' fail to feel an interest in the prosperity of the employers, for
-.that means opportunity to them. On the other hand, the employers
\ cannot fail to be interested in the welfare and good will of their
employes, for that spells fidelity, excellence of work and trade pride.
Public opinion approves the eight-hour day, especially when
it ia brought about by the very sane and business-like agreement
"which achieved it here. If all adjustments between employer and
employes were reached by similar steps, society would be spared
\he wrench and wretchedness that unfortunately characterize too
- many labor disputes. Having been accomplished by manly and
* peaceful means, and by mutual concessions, it will be the verdict ot
'public opinion that this existing adjustment shall stand. As each
. side party to it is part of a national organization, the obligation is
clear to extend the eight-hour day to the Eastern plants. If there
were an understanding that this should be done, those responsible
for that understanding have a duty in the matter that should busy
; "tiienr at once.
. A great variety of interests are touched by the commercial
:prin,ting trade. These run from literature to magnum posters. A
'deadlock over the issue of backward adjustment of hours will be
widely felt. In view of the intelligence of the two parties to the
â¢jLssue, and of their highly mutual interests, we are persuaded that
"reason will rule toward a settlement that will put the trade in San
* FTancisco in the honorable position of pioneering the short. day and
'Koldfng to it until other cities follow and equality between all is
secured. This conclusion will be aided by temperance of speech
* and action. All such elements as pride of power and desire to show
â¢ft should be eliminated by both sides, and as there is nothing in
anything except the reason that is in it, and only what is reasonable
is. permanent, we invite the parties to consider- carefully the highly
/reasonable adjustment to which both have been parties, and let it
. stand. It was reached not by threat or violence, but by mutual
* vjelding and compromise. In the spirit that madey it let it be per
manent. - :

Their wives can't have the spudS

And comblnate for duds,
And all ; the helpless children
Will have a hard 'time when ;

BETWEEN TWO TEMPERAMENTS!
A committee from the Telegraph Hill
Improvement Club,- headed Mrs.
John Farnham and Mrs. William Swart
ley, urged the" selection of flft.y-vara
block No. 129, adjacent to Washington
Park, for a children's playground. The
City Attorney was directed to begin
condemnation proceedings for the
acquisition of the lot. The block is
bounded by Greenwich, Powell, Filbert
and Stockton streets. The property is
offered at $452,700. while the City Engi
neer's appraisement Is $219,810, the
assessment of the Assessor is $94,180
and the amount available is $244,000.
The block bounded by^ Chestnut, Powell,
Lombard and Mason streets, appraised
at $243,178, is not considered as desir
able for a, playground as block 129...
The committee recommended "\u25a0 an'ap
propriation of $1000. in addition to the
$5000 appropriated in the present bud
get, to enable Engineers Manson, Wood
ward and .Waggoner to investigate
available sources of , water supply for
San Francisco. Manson said the data
of the various schemes can be verified
with the United States Geological Sur
vey and field inspection.
The offer of lands for the Washing
ton Grammar and Golden Gate School
buildings at $9500 and $12,482.50. re
spectively, were referred to the Board
of Education.
The committee ordered the purchase
from A. Riddell of a lot of land in the
Bay View district for $10,000 as the site
for the new Burnett School building,
to cost $119,000. :
Mooger will also appraise a flfty-vara
lot south of the Spring Valley School
site on Jackson street, between Larkin
and Hyde, with a view to its purchase.
Roncovierl mentioned a lot at the
southeast corner of Broadway ' and
Polk street, offered by Isaac Liebes for
$41,500. but the amount available ' is
only $24,700. Moosar said the price
was excessive and he was instructed
to make an appraisement of the lot.
City Attorney Long was given gen
eral authorization to solicit offers for
all school sites to be acquired under
the bond issue upon request of the
Board of : Education. Among these are
the lot 230x230 feet at Castro.. Henry
and Fourteenth streets, the proposed
site of the new McKinley School build
ing, for which $22,000 is available, and
a lot adjoining the Sheridan School in
Ocean View.
The SuperviÃors* Public . Utilities
Committee yesterday took active steps
looking: to the- purchase -of sites for
new schools, , with a view to_ erecting
the buildings ihefeori. immediately. '}'\u25a0 \-..
The Board of Education .formally rec
ommended the selection Of the Holla
day land at the northeast corner of Clay
and Octavla* streets, if produced.* And
overlooking Lafayette Park, as a site
for the new Lowell High Schqolbuild-
Ing. The. land la offered for {150,000,
and there Is .$176,500 available {lor the
purpose. . The committee took "no ac
tion, as City. Attorney Long stated that
H. T. Cresswell would oppose the select
tion.of the site because the law pro
hibits the use of property*- adjacent to
a park for a school site. The board be
lieves, the site to be the best for the
purpose. The; matter will be considered
at the next meeting.
The. committee requested the Board
of Works to submit the plans of the
Bergerot School, to cost $39,000. which
were prepared under, a former bond is
sue, since declared invalid.
The committee received offers to sell
two lots, each fronting- twenty-five feet
on Geary \u25a0 street; near Jones, as addi
tional playground for the Clement
Grammar School, at an aggregate price
of $59,500. The Board of Education is
disinclined to' purchase so much land
in the locality and will probably pur
chase only one" of the lots, s .
The committee directed L. H. Mooser
to appraise a lot of land. 250x203 feet,
bounded by Shrader, Grattan, Alma and
Cole streets, which the Board of Edu
cation has selected as a site for the
proposed Jackson School.
The following communication has
been received from the" Employing
Printers , and Affiliated Trades Associa
tion of San, Francisco: â¢ "V,
Articles have recently . appeared .in some of
our daily papers In reference to the. difference
existing between the employing printers arid
their employe*. These : articles only > give one
side of the controversy,,: and. tend to mislead
the public a* to : the ; ' Tacts In the case,
which are as follows:. i .. \u25a0 "
In Januarj-. â¢ 1003, the '- Typographical Union
had a minimum scale of $18 per week and a
nine-hour day. They made a demand on the
employers for^ $21 Der week, . which was bo
much in' excess of that paid in any other city
that tbe employers could not consent to it, and
entered Into a compromtea agreement, 'providing
tor an increase of 60 cents per week and a de
crease ot : fifteen . minutes per V week each : aix
months until, on January, .1905, an eight-hour
day and a $M minimum wage scale was ac
complished. ; It was expected that by January,
.1905, a majority, if not all, or the,large cities
would have conceded the j eight-hour . day, so
that tbe employers of San Francisco would' be
on an equal basis with them so far as hours
was concerned, but not one of .them. has grant
ed the eight-hour day, and they are preparing
to resist the union's demands along' these
lines. * \u25a0\u0084"-\u25a0\u25a0' â¢ â¢ - \u25a0â¢
In San Francisco, aa stated , above, we â¢ are
paying a minimum scale of 's2o per week,. and
are working eight hours per day; Omaha payo
>1S per week and works nine hours per day;
Chicago pays $19 50 per week and works ninÂ«
hours per day; Detroit pays $17 per week and
works nine hours per day; Indianapolis 1 paya
$17 per week and works nine , houre ; per day;
Cleveland pays $17 per week and worka nine

per week and works nine hours, per day; Boston
pays $17 per week and works nine hourÃ per

works nine hours r>er day. \
By comparing the wage scale and hours of
the cities noted above with that of San. Fran
olsco it In 9eÂ«n at a glance that the employing

If the merchants of San Francisco were will
ing to pay about 25 per cent more: for their
printing than formerly, in order to overcome
the Increased cost, the matter could easily W
adjusted by continuing the eigtit-hour day,- but
they are not willing to do this, and as a result
thousands of dollars are writ Kast each .month
for printing which should be kept in San Fran
cisco, ft â¢ â¢ t â¢> . '
A similar agreement- to that of the Typo
graphical \Union was entered . into with the
Printing Pressmen's Union, which agreement
expires July 1, 1905.
The International Printing Prepamen's Union
has ah agreement with the United Typothetae
of America, one clause of which reads as fol
lowr; . \u25a0
"Tnis agreement shall continue in full force
and effect until May 1, 1007. It " Is expressly
aprwd that during the life of this contract
fifty-four hours shall constitute a week's
work." - \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 --. \u25a0 . : ".. â¢.
The San FranciÂ«eo TypothetAe are a part
and parcel of the United Typothetae of Amer
ica, and all we ask "is that at the expiration
of the local agreement â July 1. 1905 â the print
ing prewraen live up to their national agree
ment with us, and treat us the same as they
trftat cmDloyers In other cities.
One of the editorials written on the subject
charges the -Employers with an attempt to
break their agreement. This is a deliberate
rolsstatement of facts, as there has been no
intention -of breaking \u25a0 the present existing
agreement,' which expires July 1.
In communications sent to the unions on the
subject and in conferences had with their com
mittees they have been advised that if they
accepted the nine-hour day,- there would-.be no
reduction* in ' the wage, scale or- other"'condl
tlons, and that as 'soon as the : employers* In
other large cities conceded the eight-hour day.
to that we were all on an ' equal basis, we would
grant' it here \u25a0 without any question, 't This Is
certainly treating -our- employes In a fair and
just manner. , and all we ask is a like treat

an "apsistar.t inspector." this beinr a clear
invasion lrto the sphere of dutics^of the Board
of Public Works *s set forth In the charter.
BUREAU OF ARCHITECTURE.
111. The Board of Public Works has among
tts existing departments a. bureau of archi-
UctST* established for many years aad ond#r
\u25a0â¢It- fupfrvlsion of a Ealaried architect- This
boreaa or divisJon of architecture has hereto
fÂ«tÂ» been reootnired and proÂ»'ld<Â«d for by the
fcard of SurÂ»ervlsors in its annual budget,
tr,a 5n the budget of appropriations for the
nut fiscaJ year the sum of t15.900 is allowed
fir that division.
- The City Architect is fully competent, able
and willing to supervise the construction of
put'.ic buildlcgs. and the allowance of 5 pet
cert" of the cort of such buildings to a
X;-t-c:a!]}- appointed architect of the Bowd of
Supervisors ia not only contrary tÂ» '*- w and
a refl<*ction upon the capacity, ability or in
t.JTity of the City Architect, bat is also a
\u25a0 df.iberate waste of the people's money. On
4 ting.c school building coaling $120,000 Â»urh
frt-clal architect's Tees would amount to SCOOQ.
And the salary ot the assistant inspector
t io tÂ» appointed for each building by the
' lV'Â£rd of. Pupe"'!sora would, ir the building
r*-quire<3 two years to complete, consume $4SOO
jnore of the taxpayers" money, to say noth
â¢><r of the further cum of $2500 ot the people's
money provided by section 21 ot the proposed \
CTfiinance to be generously given away to
" ufjo.ccessful competitors for the plans of erery
'.r^ilding to be erected and for plans never to
'lv tfed.
. I disapprove thi* proposed and unnecessap*
c'xtravagance of expenditure and assign trie
\u25a0seme a* one of my objections to the proposed
ordinance.
â¢ IV. Po far aÂ» school buildings are ccn
ecrned the proposed ordinance -Is In direct
-.â¢vnttlct with pectlcns 1 and 2 of chapter Â«.
article VII of the charter, which provide that
p!ar.Â« therefor most be rnrnlstied by the Board
rr 3Â»ubllc Works and the cocftruetlon thereof
n-.UFt be under the direcUon of sajd board and
.â¢of no one else. -. . .
EXTENT OK USURP ATIOX.
â¢V. The proposed ordinance is also c\e*r\y
in violation of section 11. chapter 1 of article
II or the charter in that it embraces many
matters not expressed in its title, among
.others to-wit: the establishment of a eys'tem
of securing plans by the Board of Supervisors,
the appointment of architects by the Board of
Supervisors, the appointment of inspectors by â¢
the Board of Supervisors, the payment of ar
chitectural prizes by the Board of Supervisors
for plans not used in the construction of \u25a0
buildings.
VI. Not only would the proposed ordinance
Jx- an illegal usurpation of the powers and :
duties of thÂ« Board of Works, but the carrying i
oat thereof would cause great delay In the
â¢ or.structlon of many much needed buildings
ujvm the cost of whore construction the tax
vayrrs of Sen Francisco are already paying
tr-avy interest for money ex-en now lying idle
hi 'he city treasury â the proceed* of the city's
bonds already aold and available for the pur
poses for which the bonds were voted.
â¢ VII. The object desired to be accomplished
V'y this ordinance can in my opinion be
achieved oaly by a charter amendment whereby
alone can be overturned the provisions of the
. barter placlror upon the Board of Public
TVorks the duties, responslblliUee and obliga
tions which your honorable board by .this or- ;
'-rnance seek? to assume, . r' '
VIII lam also of the opinion thai unless
the plans for public buildings arÂ» furnished by
tiie Board of Works grave question may ariee
as to the legality of any payments for con
struction done under plans otherwise obtained.
If it be desirable to secure plans by com
r^tftion, and. I am free to say that I per
sonally favor men competition, let the same,
until thÂ« charter shall be amended. bÂ«. under
the direction and supervision of the Board of:
Public "Works, the body open and In whem
dcrelve this power ana duty under the city's
arpanlc law. Keopectfully submitted.

pleasure of the BcarJ of Supervisors, the

11. It is in direct contra%ention of the prtÂ».
visions of section 3, chapter 1. article VI, in
that it assuin^s to provide for the appoint
ment by the Beard of Supervisors of axcht
tecta, the power to appoint wham is by the

Mayor Schmitz yesterday sent to the
Board of Supervisors a formal notice of
his \eto of a bill providing for -the au
thorization of expenditures froia the pub
lic buQ&ng fund. The Mayor cites eight
reasons *A'hy he disapproves of the bill,
the first five being: its alleged contraven
tion to sections of the City Charter. The
following is the text of the letter:

Among : the causes f% that ; ; have xon

following: " \
'\u25a0 Cripple " Creek . has gained ' about $3,000,000,
due to renewed mining. activity following the
successful completion of a new drainage tun
nel, the cessation of the strike \u25a0 which - inter
fered with the production of . 1903, and new
discoveries . of rich ore bodies. â¢; Goldneld. dur
ing the ' first \u25a0 year ' of its 1 existence.' added at
least $1,500,000 to the : value of the output.
In ; the third I place, \ the production of Califor
nia has risen nearly $3,000,000 compared with
the production 'â¢ of j 1903. 1 . This | increase is dvÂ«
in considerable degree ' to the development of
the dredging industry in the \u25a0 Sacramento Val
ley. Lastly, the smelting of auriferous copper
ores has " received a " great impetus in Utah,
augmenting ' the gold - output \u25a0in that State by
$1,000,000. These ; four f actors, together with
the moderate gains in the production of Alaska,
Montana and South Dakota, are sufficient to
account for the (increase of nearly $11,000,000
In the production of the . last year compared
with that of 1903. Lindgren classifies the gold
. production to its derivation " from
placers, dry or quartroaa ores, copper ores and
lead ores. He estimates the production of gold
from placers as . $12,000,000, from quartaoea
gold and silver ores at $62,754,000. from cop
per ores at $4,300,000 and from lead ores at
14,600,000, making ' a total production- of
$51,551,000â a cum that practically agrees with
the estimate" of ' the Director Of the .Mint.-
Alaska . is the largest producer ot placer gold,
and should show a gain ot at lease $200,000,
the output being estimated at $3,800,000.

Mont, former president of the Anaconda
Copper* Mining Company, has been in
specting the Bullfrog mining district and
that lie was favorably impressed. Oper
ators - from every direction are pouring
into the Goldneld and Bullfrog districts-
Big deals are under.' way..! The - newly
'formed Gibraltar Mines , Syndicate has
bought the southeastern end of Bonanza
Mountain. James Farrell has purchased
the Equitable claims,*' on the southeast of
Bonanza 'Mountain,- and-the Morris and
Phillips groups, at the mountain's base.
Large values are reported to ! have been
discovered in this locality. Farrell says
that nothing that" he has read about the
Bullfrog district does it justice. He went
to Bullfrog at the^equest of J.H. Shock
ley, mining engineer. The older the camp
is, the greater the excitement." In part,
the correspondent at Goldfleld writes:
The Combination, Florence, January and the

and the sentiment of outsiders here is that tne
lease system Is the : best for the progress 1 or
the camp. Mine owners frown upon it as a
rule. They admit that It helps to, bring a
good mining camp' into quick prominence and
results in the employment ' of a large number
Of men. but they point out that onoe the
lessees strike rich ore they proceed to^ gouge
the mine and not to develop it on '""ng
lines. : 'As- capital' iÂ« not wanting In Goldfleld
the lease system seems to have received a Wack
eye. Professional lessees, on tho other, hand,
claim that it is impossible hi any case here
to get 'a lease for" over ; a. year, and that If
the mine owners would follow the. practioe
of Leadville in, the early days and lease for
five to seven years/ five thousand miners-would
find employment ! here In a few months and
thÂ« full strength of the district would- be ,dis
closed in a comparatively short period. ;: ,.-.

LONDON, June 2.â According to the
Daily Mirror, the â¢ report : of a War Office
committed on the improper 1 disposal of
military stores jat the Conclusion of the
South African war,' reveals a huge scan
dal. The report,- the paper says, censures
a number of officers whose names are
given and who are alleged to have worked
In collusion with J contractors. | j The latter

SACRAMENTO, June 2.â "With ref
erence to a : story .published in San
Francisco to-day mentioning 1 the State
I^and Office in connection with alleged
iand frauds. Surveyor General Victor
Woods said to-day that the article was
merely the republication' of a story
printed in the newspapers several years
ago. The charge was made \u25a0. that an
application made out by- a person pur
porting to , be Horace Philbrook was
forged. The application bears date of
August T, 1901,- and was filed during the
administration of' former Surveyor
General M. J. Wright. Said Surveyor
General Woods to-day:
Borne comment Is made ln the paper because
I have not . referred certain contests, alleging
fraud, to the Superior Court. I wanted to de
termine what constitutes a contest and there
fore referred the matter to Attorney General
U. S. Webb for his ' opinion.' - These' contests
were filed In my office last April, durincr my
absence. ' I have consulted . Attorney - General
Webb \u25a0 three times on this subject. As yet
he has not been able to give me an . opinion.
He Is a very busy man, and the research nec
essary In such matters as I have referred to
him Is very great. - - .
Regarding . fraudulent applications, I can
only say that we have no . means of keeping
tab on them. A certificate, of purchase is
transferable, and It cannot be told from them
who the original purchaser was. .

last night Edward H. Conger, United
States Minister to^ Mexico, ! was flood
bound trying to ! get to this city from
Mesilla Valley, ao that - he could reach

The Santa Fe tracks were carried away,
thus cutting him off, and with an old
Texas stage driver he made the trip of
forty-five miles in a buggj*. He ' reached
his hotel here after midnight, much "ex
hausted, but was able to go to Mexico
this morning. Much of the way the road
was flooded? and at one place the roaring
Rio Grande had nearly, destroyed j the em
bankment. The two got safely over, how
ever, after a strenuous night. " Conger

LONDON, June 2.â The situation \u25a0 over
Morocco is viewed with no little, concern
in diplomatic circles here. Indirectly /.the
Sultan's refusal to accept the French pro
posals is regarded as a rebuff , to Great
Britain, but it is understood that, rather
than risk further complications, '.. France
will be likely to Join the other poVrersj in
a conference . at Fez, and | Great ; Britain
will follow suit. Should France decline
to . enter the conference ;, Great '.Britain
likewise will decline, in which event seri
ous difficulty may ensue.
PARIS, June 2.â Although official con
firmation is withheld it ; is now generally
accepted here that the report from" Tan
gier to the effect that the Sultan, of Mo
rocco had declined the French . proposi
tions, for the reform of Morocco unless
approved by an j international
was correct. This is widely commented
on as amounting to a check, if \u25a0 not a

Even with the aid of a triple play and
a couple of doubles, all within the short
epace of three Innings. Fitzgerald was
not there strong enough yesterday at Rec
reation Park to take the Commuters down
the.l ine. They managed to ' sneak a run
through ln the fourth Inning. It was the
only one of the game and therefore, the
most Important thing that happened dur
ing tbte afternoon. Scoreâ Oakland 1, Ta
coma 0.
The triple play was the first of the sea
eon. It Is a tort of annual event that
happens In every league Just about the
time when no one is busy thinking about
it. Yesterday It came to pass ln the third
spasm. Moskiman and Lohman had bean
passed when Van Haltren started a fast
cne for right field. Doyle grabbed the
ball in a , twinkling', tossed it "to Eagan
at second and the latter whipped it over
tr> Nordyke at first, making the play a
reality before the fans knew what was
being pulled off.
No one seems to know why the Com
muters did not make about forty runs.
They commenced to bingle Fitzge;-ald's
twisters when the bell tapped and they
kept the rapid fire up pretty much till
afl was at an end. They were bad on the
bases and Tacoma was lucky in the field.
With the bags all filled in the first and
no one down. Streib shot an easy cne at
-Fitzgerald and the first double *vas made.
'Moskiman pitched as good a game of
Ball as a fan would want to gase upon.
Doyle started off the game with a hit to
center field, but after that time not a
Tiger negotiated a safe one. Moskiman
was never in a hole and had the high
sign on them all.
The Commuters squeezed their run
through In the fourth, when Dunleavy
"whisked a two-cushion ehot over third
and Streib beat out an infield hit. boost
ing Dunn alons: to third. There was one
gone at the time, so when Kelly hit to
short it locked as though a double play
would come off. Doyle's return throw to
rirst was wide and Dunleavy arrived with
the run. The score:

COMMERCIAL NEWS
STEAMSHIP ROBERT DOLLAR, BOUND PROM SAN PEDRO FOR SEATTLE, WHICH APPEARED OFF HUENEME ON
THURSDAY WITH A BROKEN SHAFT. SHE SIGNALED FOR HELP. THE TUG DEFIANCE WAS AT ONCE SENT
TO HER ASSISTANCE AND WILL TOW HER TO THIS PORT.
The complaint for libel is based on. a
statement made by Montgomery . that
Baldwin In building the California. Arrow
pilfered his (Montgomery's) - ideas. Mont y
gomery also, accused Baldwin of tamper
ing with Wa aeroplanes when he was
about to give an exhibition In this city.
Professor Montgomery had little to say
to-day In regard to the case. He, said
that he had not named Baldwin in mak-.
ing the accusation that the aeroplane had
been tampered with. He said he had
stated that he had been told that Baldwin
had been seen on the grounds the day of.
the ascension here. < ...-i.
.SAX JOSE, June 2.â Prof esor J. J.'*"
Montgomery of Santa Clara . College, the Â»
Inventor of the aeroplane, who has been
charged by Thomas S. Baldwin with libel,
called at the Sheriff's office this afternoon
to surrender. himself as soon as he learned
he ,was wanted. He deposited $30 cash
ball., To-day Sheriff Rosa received a war
rant for Montgomery's arrest on a charge
of criminal libel. The complaint was
made ' before Police Judge Cabantss of
San Francisco. ...
-While the owner and finder were dis
cussing the question of remuneration
Detective Bunner joined the couple and
>took Barrett to \ police headquarters.
There the young man was informed that
if he * persisted in; his ' demand for $300
he would be arrested, and suddenly real
izing that his position 1 was a dangerous
one Barrett withdrew* his demand for a
reward and 'handed over the satchel.. He
was later given :$5O: $50 by Mrs. Davis as a
compensation 1 for his .trouble, and the
woman and Barrett bade each other
au.eu seemingly in the best of spirits.
Immediately after. hanging up the tele
phone Mrs. . Davis hurried to i police head
quarters, "where ' she \u25a0 laid ' the matter be
fore^ Captain "Burnett, 'who advised her
to keep i the appointment. He then de
tailed Detective Bunner on the case, and
the latter .â was on hand yesterday after
noon when airs. .Davis and the stranger
met at the telephone office. The man,
who afterward gave the' name of .J. J.
Barrett, told , Mrs. Davis that he had
found the satchel in : the Oakland train,
and Insisted that- he receive ! $500 for his
honesty.
Mrs..A.\H. Davis, who until her recent
unexpected â marriage to Captain /Davis
Of the British army was Miss Lena Dyke
of Saii Francisco, yesterday recovered a
satchel |of "jewelry, valued at about $1200,
that she lost on Memorial -day. On Tues
day last,' while coming from Oakland,! she
dropped the satchel containing her val
uables in 'a railroad car across the bay.
and did. not realize the fact until she had
reached this ' city, ." V;- \u0084" > i
! 2 The following . morning Mrs. Davis ad
vertised- her-loss in the local-papers-*nd
,on -Thursday,'- received I a .telephone mes
eage '.to the- effect 1 that the man at the
other , end of the wire : had found the val
uables. He refused.'; however, : to deliver
them until assured of a reward of $500,
and finding .that It was useless to argue
with the ( fellow,. Mrs.. Davis finally, made
anl appointment for yesterday afternoon
at the telephone, office on 1 ; Geary street,
. near Grant avenue.* She promised to
have the necessary $500 bir that time.
A cablegram received yesterday at
the Merchants' Exchange tells of the
Eirailar plight of another steamer, the
Ivydene of the British merchant ma
rine She broke her tail shaft and lost
l>er propellor while on the way from
Tslntau and yesterday was towed Into
Nagasaki.
The steamship Robert Dollar, bound
from San Pedro for Seattle, has broken
xJown in the Santa Barbara channel
#nd"late on Thursday night the Spreck
els. tug Defiance, in command of Cap
tain Dan James, left here to take the
helpless steamer in tow. News of the
Poliar's predicament was received from
Hueneme. The steamer had drifted to
within twenty miles of that point and
iiad -signaled the information that she
Red broken her tail ehaf t and wanted
'assistance. The Defiance will bring
the disabled vessel to this port, where
repairs will be made. . .
\u25a0:ln the not very long ago steamers
were bo rigged that in the event of
accident to propellor, sufficient canvas
could be spread to enable the vessel
to -jnake fair head \u25a0way under sail. In
the modern steamer, however, no pro
vision is made for a breakdown. The
only "spars with which the steamer of
to-day is provided are those necessary
for. . working the cargo and the little
canvas that could be spread on these
stumps would give the vessel 'even
steerage way only in a ' heavy breeze.
"\Vlin the increase of telegraphic com
munication, by means of which places
formerly far remote can be reached by
the flash of the electric spark, the
necessity for providing steamers with
auxiliary sail power has decreased. In
stead of hoisting sail and trusting to
the wind to take his disabled vessel
to "port, the commander of to-day, in
tfce event of accident, either sends a
wireless to the nearest port or signals
his predicament, as did the Robert
Dollar's ekipper, and then awaits pa
tiently for the tug that is sure to come.
PORTLAND. June 2.â The feature of
the .Lewis'- and J Clark Exposition to-day
was the dedication of the handsome build.
Ing erected by the State of Washington.
Vice President | Fairbanks and the Gov
ernors of Oregon and "Washington par
ticipated in the ceremonies. United States
Senator Samuel Piles of Washington also
addressed the assemblage.
When Vice President Fairbanks was in
troduced ' the audience' arose and he /was
given an ovation. The -Vice President's
unstinted praise of the exposition pleased
'his .audience and he was repeatedly
cheered. It is manifest, he said, that
the growth of 'the Pacific Coa3t is Just
beginning, and he marveled at the pro
digious possibilities of commercial devel
opment during the next century.- ,
; The Vice President and his party left
to-night for Chicago, where he wm ar
rive on Tuesday morning next. From
Chicago thÂ« Vice President will go to
Flint, Mich'., where he will participate
in the laying of the cornerstone. of the
new Federal building at that place. It
is expected that on June 14 Mr. Fairbanks
will deliver an address at the commence
ment exercises of the lowa State * Uni
versity. :

NEW YORK, i June i 2. â The *j Government

contrast to many recent private reports on, the
acreage . and the condition ; of.'- the crop, more
particularly i as â¢ compared? with that- of - the
Ecuthem Association of ! Wednesday," which es
timated the . decrease in acreage <- at 18% per
cent, and also. that of one : of. the, leading local
operators of a* week, ago,; which 'made the de
crease in acreage. 17.3, per jcentii and > the con
dition â¢ about "70 per cent. ... When . . the " report
was, issued prices- went. off ten; points or more.'

The bag In which Mrs. Scott always
carried her rings and necklaces when
Fhe was not wearing them was one
that she had made for the purpose. In
it there were seven little compart
ments made of silk and lined with
chamois. This she usually attached to
" a belt on her person, but in her haste
Thursday she slipped them into her
coat pocket. The individual pieces
were as follows: A diamond necklace
set in platinum with a pear-shaped
pearl pendant, value $4000; a diamond
brooch, value $200; a* marquis ring
with a diamond scroll, value $500; an
odd-shaped ring made of a diamond
solitare encircled with emeralds, value
$400; a double diamond ring, value
â¬200; a diamond ring with a pearl
bar (Mrs. Scott's engagement ring),
value $200; pearl shirt studs belonging
to Mr. Scott. The police of the city
have been given a description of the
gems and they have notified the dia
mond buyers to look out for them in
case any one should try to dispose of
the jewels.
.. While walking in Golden Gate Park
- jate Thursday, afternoon Mrs. J. H.
Ecott, the wife of the Tax Collector, lost
nearly all her valuable Jewels. She
had them tied carefully in a little silk
compartment bag and the parcel
" dropped out of her coat pocket. As
soon as she discovered her loss she
hurried toÂ» the Park Police Station, but
. a careful search over the path she had
traversed failed to discover the mlss
. â¢ Ing gems. They had not turned up late
last night. At present Mrs. Scott Is
out about $6000 worth of diamonds and
pearls. â¢' \u25a0*
For a long time it has been the cus
' torn of Mrs. Scott to ride out to the
Cliff House and to walk part of the
way back through Golden Gate Park.
She does this on Thursday afternoons,
and this time she was accompanied by
her niece. Miss Elsa Hink, of Berkeley.
To prevent possible robbery. Mrs. Scott
never leaves her Jewels in her apart
ments at 857 Sutter etreet. but always
carries them with her in a , silken bag.
As the day was chilly she thrust the
bag into the outside pocket of her long
* coat. There they rested in safety un
til after the luncheon at the Cliff House
and the start for the park. Then the
eun grew warm and Mrs. Scott took
off her coat and tied It around her
waist, never thinking of the rich par
cel of Jewels In her pocket. This was
at 2 o'clock and it was not until two
. hours later, when the two had reached
the aviary, that the loss was noticed.
With sickening heart Mrs. Scott looked
In every pocket for the gems, but they
were gone. Realizing that she could
not find them herself, 6he rushed for
the Park Police Station and reported
her loss to Sergeant Owens. Two
mounted policemen carefully searched
over the route that Mrs. Scott had
taken, but some one had already picked
up the valuable package.
"It is not the cash value of the
diamonds that I care so much about,"
said Mrs. Scott yesterday afternoon,
"but it Is the fact that they all had
a -peculiar worth to me. They were
given to me on special occasions. The
one that I miss most is my engage
ment ring. The jewels were very fine.
and for that reason I fear that some
one will remove them "from their set
tings and sell them separately. It was
-pure carelessness on my part, and I
; really deserve to lose them. Mr. Scott
will offer a reward of about $600 for
their return."

times for his peace of mind, and, further
more, : her love of -good, sparkling ; wine
Interfered with her professional calling,
caused her . to break " theatrical :\u25a0'engage
ments and made her a burden in general.
George Pauncef ort, also an actor, cor
roborated , Mestayer. He 1 "offered further
proof in support of plaintiff's charge of
cruelty by testifying that on one ; occa
sion, when Mestayer, ;\u25a0 his wife ' and s the
witness were present at a late supper, he
saw Mrs. Mestayer,"* who had been par
taking freely of wine, . strike her husband
on the ear. The blow lifted "Mestayer off

Judge " Troutt granted the plaintiff a de
