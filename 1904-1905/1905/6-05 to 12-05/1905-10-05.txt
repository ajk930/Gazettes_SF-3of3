OAKLAND, Oct. 4. â Trusting to the
e peed of his automobile to bring vic
tory in a race of nearly 200 miles
against death that a loving daughter
might reach the bedside of her dying
father ere the sands of life, ran .out,
J. V 3 Madison, the proprietor of\the
Fruitvale Lumber Company, braved the
perils of unknown mountain roads In
a night ride from Oakland to Jackson,
Amador County, and won the race.
Twice it seemed that the trip must
end in disaster, as accidents caused de
lay, but the difficulties were overcome
ar.d the goal was reached six hours
ahead of the. best time that could have
been made by. train. .
Madison himself narrowly, escaped"
death on the return from Jackson to
and only the presence of
- mini -o>c tkla. --wire. ' wfaÂ« ,- aTscotnpalrt'wt*
him, prevented a fatal termination of
the run. Exhausted by the terrible
etrain of guiding the automobile over
strange roads through the dark. Madi
son fell asleep at the wheel and fell
forward over the steering wheeL The
twist of the wheel caused the machine
to swerve toward the side of the road,
where a high bank threatened destruc
tion. Mrs. Madison caught the wheel
just in time to prevent a fatal acci
dent.
Madison began his trip from Fruit
vale on Friday afternoon. On the
morning of that day Mrs. Marie Zap
pettiai. the wife of P. H. Zappettini of
the firm of Zappettini & Perasso, the
general agents of the Anchor Line
Steamship Company In San Francisco,
â¢who lives at 1800 Merrill avenue in
Fruitvale, received a. telegram an
nouncing that her father. John Maz
Â«ero, a well-known resident of Volcano,
Amador County,* was at the point of
death and desired to see his daughter
before the end came. A time-table
showed that the last train by which
MxÂ«. Zappettini could reach the bed
side of her father for twenty-four
hours had already gone, and she rea
lized that unless she could find some
other means of transportation her
tather might pass away before she
could reach him.
DECIDES TO GO BY AUTO.
Then It was that she thought of
making the Journey by means of an
automobile. She telephoned to a num
ber of garages In this city, and also in
San Francisco, but one and ail the
owners of the machines refused to
make the trip because of the hard
mountain roads. As* a last resort Mrs
Zappettini appealed to Madison, who
lives at 8416 Washington street, near
the Zappettini residence. After learn
ing the circumstances the latter said
et once that he would attempt to make
the mn to s Jackson, where Mrs. Zap
pettini was to be met' by a conveyance
to take her to Volcano.
On telling his wife of his decision
ehe refused to allow him to make the
trip alone, but Insisted on going with
i^. **?Â£ Zappettini took her infant
child with her, and her, brother, Frank
Mazzero, also accompanied her, makinir
a party of five.
The start from Fruitvale was made
at I p. m., and all went well until dark
ness fell while the auto waÂ» speeding
over the road through the â¢. Livermore
, Th * re T<ra Â» Â» Pile of gravel in the
road which, unseen until too late to
bring the machine to a stop; caused the
first accident, which for a time seemed
destined to end the trip right there. As
the machine ran into the gravel several
Hlying bits of rock penetrated into the
K>ar of the auto, and tho case was
JES?^* 1 /?^? 1 " jammc <* fe chain.'
Madison tried in vain to repair the
damage with the tools at hand, and at
last In despair he tore a rail from a
roads de fence and forced the gear case
back 1Â» Place. This overcame the trou
ble and the party resumed its Inter
rupted journey.
Reaching Stockton without further
mishap Madiron discovered that the
gasoline had run out and a search of
thÂ« town failed to discover a store opS
at which the supply could be replen
ished, so the party was forced to wait
until morning before resuming the trip
Leaving as soon as they had filled the
gasoline tank, they reached Jackson
without further trouble, more than six ;
hours ah*a4 of the train, by which Mrs
Zappettini would have arrived had sh
waited for that means of transporta
tion. The waÂ«ron by which she was to
continue h*r trip wavon hand, and n 1
f<-w.f <-w. hours ; later Madison was rewarded '
for his kindness by a message that sh*. I
had reached tht bedside of her father â¢
Just in time. " j

Roosevelt to-day struck sturdily: back. at
the railroad men who have been. saying
that he was about to weaken in his fight
on the question of railroad rates and
would consent to a modification of the
Esch-Townsend bill so ; as not to confer
power . on the Interstate Commerce Com
mission to fix rates. He told . Represen
tative, Townsend of Michigan, one of the
authors of the famous bill which was to
bogganed through. the House last winter
and was defeated in , the Senate, that he
I had not . changed his opinion on any of
the principles . mvolved and that if the
railroad managers thought that he had
they would have a rude awakening on
December 4, when his annual message
goes' to Congress.

after he had had a short talk with the
President and . had â¢ made -an engagement

by Paul Mohr, a well known civil engi
neer, who sÂ«eks a judgment against the
woman to satisfy a claim for $1000, al
leged to be due him for service rendered
by him in an advisory capacity.
Mrs. O'Connor's troubles are the out
growth of an attempt on her part to pro
mote a scheme for a - railroad between
Yreka and Scotts Valley, a distance of
forty miles. For a time the project looked
promising. The surveys were made and
assurance was received from the officials
of the Southern Pacific Company that the
latter would not oppose her plans. Sev
eral capitalists had agreed to finance the
road, but when they were finally called
upon to produce the coin they balked and
Mrs. O'Connor's ambition as a promoter
was shattered.
" Meanwhile Mrs. O'Connor, It is alleged,
engaged Engineer Mohr to examine and
report upon the feasibility of the route,
agreeing to pay him $1000 for his services.
He failed to get his fee and decided to
sue. Apparently Mrs. O'Connor learned
of his intentions, for when various means
â¢wero adopted yesterday by the process

seen and coyly avoided the traps that had
been act for her."*"- Until a late hour last
night detectives were stationed in tho

cost, with improvements 'deemed neces

two baths. These were rented for $1500

four of the tenants were the immediate

SENDS BULLET
THROUGH HEART
j \u25a0â¢\u0084- . . *. - . ' .Â» \u25a0 \u25a0 -
Samuel Edward Beaver killed himself
yesterday in his apartments at the Carl
ton', US Grant avenue, by shooting him
self through the heart.
He bad been a sufferer for the last two
months- from diabetes, coupled with an
attack of gangrene. His illness made him
despondent and ; in a fit'of melancholy he
took his life: -;\u25a0 ~ , -.â¢ i '"Â£s?s "..
During his illness'* hernias attended by
his . nurse, , William & "Woods." .- Yesterday
shortly, before - noon 'V Beaver asked . for
his case of pistols, -which : WoodÂ» brought
to him from: an '.upstairs', room. Nothing
was thought >f;; the request, as Beaver
was a sj>artsraan'and itook a great Inter
est t ln his ; '&hpotlris outfit. The case was
placed b>side v hÂ»s bed, after which the
nurse lefiv'the - room. Beaver selected a
pistol - that* he had \ used many times In
target practice and placing it directly
over, his heart fired the fatal shot. Nurse
Woods came back to the room a few min
utes later, to find a stream, of blood gush
ing from the wound. Death was instan
taneous. No word was left giving any
cause for the rash act. His relatives and
friends can only assign as a Reason that
he was suddenly -taken with a fit of the
blues' over, his -suffering' and. decided, to
end his misery.... â¢ \u25a0 . ,
Beaver was for twenty-seven years a
paying teller in the Bank of California.
He was highly .esteemed there, and three
years ago, when, his health failed, he was
placed on the retiredlist with' a liberal
pension allowance from the bank.
He had a wide circle of acquaintances,
and there Is hardly a man in downtown
business circles who was not acquainted
with him. He had . resided for twenty
seven years in the . rooms in which he
died. He' was unmarried, and was a man
of very quiet habits. He had always been
a sportsman, and devoted much of his
time to hunting. He was an expert shet.
with eitlur-rtfle or pistol. -
As soon as Coroner Leland learned of
the circumstances he turned the remains'
over to Frederick Beaver, a nephew of
the deceased, who had the body removed
to the undertaking .parlors of Clark &
Booth, on Van Ness avenue. Beaver was
about'6o years old. He was- a frequent
visitor to the Bohemian- Club, where he
was known as "Colonel Beaver.", Heand
"Uncle" George Bromley were old friends.-
They would sometimes sit together in the
club for hours" recounting stories of ojd
times. He was very popular in business
circles. He was a genial man, of kind
and generous impulses, and .highly .es
teemed..by, all .with whom he came in
contact. $jio3s33&B&Â£m

residing, in this city. They are Frederick

EMBASSADORS
IN CONFERENCE
Batifications of Treaty of
â¢Portsmouth Will Be Ex
changed at Washington
AT STATE DEPABTMENT
Baron E6sen : and Takahira
Consult With Third As
\u25a0 sistant Secretary vAdee
WASHINGTON. Oct. 4.â Ratlflcatlons
of the treaty of Portsmouth will be ex
changed at Washington between Baron
Rosen, the Russian Embassador. and
Takahira, the Japanese Embassador, as
soon as these important documents are
received from St. Petersburg and Tokio.
The ratifications will 1 contain the' French
and English texts of the treaty. This
was decided at a conference to-day be
tween Baron Rosen and Takahira which
began in the Russian Embassador's apart
ments and was concluded at the State
Department. Takahira called on Baron
Rosen this morning to find out from him
the usual form of the Russian ratifica
tion. In order that the Minister might
inspect a copy they went to the State
Department, where Mr. Adee. the -third
Assistant Secretary. Tead them and
showed the ratification of the treaty.
Takahira will inform his Government
fully on the subject so that the ratlflca
tlons will conform. The special powers
to be conferred on the two plenipoten
tiaries enabling the exchange of ratifi
cations will be Identical in scope.
The approval ot the treaty by the Privy
Council at Tokio m effect ratifies the con
vention and it is expected the formality
of the ' Emperor's signature will follow
shortly. As the treaty becomes effective
as "soon as ratified, the exchange of rati
fications is only a formality. .
Japan will be ready to exchange as
soon as the Emperor's signature is af
fixed and the formal ratification can be
prepared and delivered at the legation.
But it is not believed that the Russian .
ratification will be long delayed. -
No arrangements have been concluded
for the ceremony of ratifications, but !t
probably will be an . even more simple
ceremony than was the signing of the
treaty at Portsmouth. The only differ
ence between the two ceremonies will
be the presence of President Roosevelt,
who will be invited by the two envoys to
witness the exchange.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 4.â Russia to
day agreed to the Japanese proposition
to exchange prisoners of war whereby
1566 Japanese prisoners in Russia will be
delivered at some point on the Western/
frontier of Russia and 64,000 Russians
will be delivered at the ports of Kobe,
Nagasaki and Yokohama, whence they
will be conveyed to Vladivostok in ten
Russian transports now interned at
' Shanghai â¢ and Saigon and two or three
other ships which are being *en^ from
Odessa. : ' â¢
The â¢ American Charge d'Affaires,
Spencer Eddy, is endeavoring to make
special and more speedy arrangements
for the release of 250 sick Japanese for
whom it is hoped Japan may send a ship
direct to the Baltic
TOKIO. Oct. 4.â The peace treaty pass

TO BE ENTOMBED
WHERE HE FELL
Hope Is Abandoned of Get
ting Body of Youth From
Rocky Mountain "Chasm
DENVER. Colo., Oct. 4.â Abandoning
hope of getting his body from a deep
chasm in the heart of the Rockies to the
family burying ground in Illinois, the
relatives of Lewis G. Levings, ian Ar
raour Institute student, have determined
to build a tomb where the body lies.
A sepulcher Is being built around and
over the remains, which lie in an almost
impenetrable gulch at the base of Mount
YpEilon, Estes Park, into which the
young student fell to death August 2.
while attempting to scale a cliff which
never has been successfully ascended by
man.
A thousand feet below the Epot where
Levings slipped, the body lies on the bank
of a bottomless pool or* â¢ lake, above
â¢which cliffs rise for hundreds of feet on
each side.
The father, a millionaire of. Canton.
111., ordered that no expense be [ spared
in recovering the body, and many at
tempts were made to bring it out.
Now. at the father's order, men are at
v/ork building a tomb from the bqwlders
and slocks of granite at the foot of the
slide. .
Men and sacks of cement are let down
with ropes and masons are building the
massive monument. The work is being
done under the direction of Enos Mills, a
noted Longs Peak guide.

CANDIDATES FOR CHAIRMANSHIP OF REPUBLICAN COUNTY COMMITTEE. WHO EACH ; RECEIVED FORTY-THREE

AFTER THE MUNICIPAL ELECTION, TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN RYAN TO SERVE MEANTIME. ,
Vote on Selection of Gotinty Qnairman Ends
in a .j)feaSio.ck Over Ryan and Davis.
Ryan 43, Davis 43, was the outcome
of the contest last night for chairman
of. the new Republican County Com
mittee. When the tie vote was an
nounced the committee deferred per
manent organization^ until the ! third
Tuesday in November. A. scheme de
vised by Postmaster Arthur G. 'Fisk
and Jere Burke to seize the governing
body of the Republican party and trans
fer it to. the Southern. Pacific Railroad
came dangerously^ near execution,
owing to the fact \u25a0 that the r leaders l of
the San Francisco Republican League
had been devoting their energies to im
portant work in behalf of John S. Part
ridge for Mayor.
The issue before the County Commit
tee was clearly defined. It was the
judgment of men who have in good
faith and. firm purpose enlisted In the
battle to redeem San Francisco from
the odium of graft that plain language
should be spoken. Therefore the 1-rec

May lynch A. 0. Bowen, Who
Has Been Charged With
the Murder of His Wife
EpecUl Dissaten to Th* Call.
REDDING, Oct. 4.â A. O. Bowen, ac
cused of the murder of bis wife at the
Bo wen farm, near Oro Fino, Slskiyou
County, was captured this morning la
a barn at Oro Fino. Grant Whlpple. a
brother-in-law of Bowen, made the
capture. Whipple and Bowen's son
stood guard over the accused man un
til the arrival of Deputy Sheriff Shaw
from Yreka.
Bowen is accused of having killed his
wife and of dragging the body into the
house and then setting tire to the build
ing to hide the crime. The body 'of
Mrs. Bowen was found in ' the ruins.
There was evidence to show that mur
der had been done. Bowen maintains
that he is innocent.
When Whlpple went out to the barn
to feed i his stock, Bowen was sitting
on the manger. Bowen begged Whip
ple for something to eat.- Whipple re
plied: "I will give you food, but will
not protect you from the mob." Bowen
said he was innocent and wanted some
thing to eat at all hazards.
From 6:30 o'clock until 11 o'clock
Whlpple and Michael Bowen, a son of
the accused, stood guard over Bowen
and no one in Oro Fino knew \u25a0ot his
presence. Deputy Sheriff Shaw was no
tified and. drove twenty-six miles from
JTreka to Oro Fino without a stop. He
secured Bowen and started back at full
speed, landing his man safely in the
County Jail at Yrefea shortly after 5
o'clock this evening.
Reports from different parts of Slski
you County, in the vicinity of Scott*
Valley, states that a large mob ts gath
ering and Is on the way to Yreka. It
is feared by the officers that an attempt
will be made to take Bowen from" the
jail .and lynch him. Sheriff Howard
was in Redding when the news of the
capture came. It had been rumored
that Bowen was here. The Sheriff Im
mediately took the -train to b* at his

out of jail Is made.

WOMAN FINDS COOLIE
UNDERNEATH HER BED
He Frightens Her and Stabs at Her Husband
When the Latter Tries to Catch Him.
QUAN TUNG ON TRIAL FOR OFFENSE
JAMES C CRAWFORD.
After fifteen years of faithful service
as a domestic in the family of Mrs. 4 D.
A. Levy, residing at 1384 McAllister
street, Quan Tung is accused before Po
lice Judge Mogan of being the Chineee
male adult who was discovered in-con
cealment underneath a bed in the : home
of Mrs. I. Goodman . at 137& McAlllsf r
street, and of having greatly frightened
Mrs. Goodman and viciously stabbed at
her husband when that gentleman fu
lilely endeavored to check his flight.
Mrs. Goodman, whose wlfehood is only
about a year old, testified that she and
Mr. Goodman spent one recent evening
away from home, and when. thÂ«y re
turned to tlielr domicile she went to her
Bleeping chamber, doffed her hat. stooped
down to place the headgear in,, its. box
i . * \u2666 :r - - i
and was almost paralyzed with fright
by seeing underneath the bed something
that "moved like gelatine." It was no
gelatinous substance, however. that
emerged from cover when she screamed,
but a raw-boned and very active China
man, who dashed past her and into the
hallway, where he encountered and tried
to stab with a knife Mr. Goodman and
then disappeared in the outer night,
leaving behind him a dingy black hat
arid a sheet of crimson cloth, the latter
apparently â¢ having been Intended for
utilization as a face mask.
Detectives ODea and Ryan were as
signed to the task of ascertaining the
mysterious marauder's identity, and the ,
result was their arrest of Quan Tung.
They learned that on the night In ques- \u25a0
tion Quan Tung neither was at his place I
of employment nor at any of his accus- j
tomed haunts in Chinatown: that he did I
not return to the home of the Levys, al- !
though there was a considerable sum I
due him as wages, and that he kept him- :
self confined in the Celestial quarter, i
Other facts equally significant were ad- |
duced in support of the prosecution. j
Mrs. Levy told the court that , Quan i
Tung. had been a good servant, and that;
he wore a hat similar to that left be
hind by the fleeing coolie who had scared
Mrs. Goodman and attempted Mr. Good
man's life, but she had never seen the
red cloth until it was produced in court.
Ehe thought it rather strange when he
etayed away from fcer house and sent
no explanation of his absence, as he had
never dene. such a thing before, and to
leave .Wi...j?p unclaimed was Incompatible
with Chinese character.
More testimony will be heard to-mor
row.

When asked why she disturbed the

shook her head and smilingly replied
that she did not know. Of. her sanity
there could be no, question, she averred,
because thrice had . she been examined

might not believe it, but she was a

alleged, nor could she accuse them of.

roof of her house and there, attired
only in a robe de nuit, 'dancing and
Binginy, 'she might have done so, bat
the act was not recorded in her mem
ory. In the matter of tippling, per
haps she was not more self-indulgent
than some of the ladles who were so
eager to testify against her. If â¢â¢â¢she
did. occasionally Imbibe a little beer It
was solely ; for the soporific effect of

The case of W. F. Hopkins, ac.cused
of having stabbed with intent to mur
der James McGinley. was due for de
cision by Judge Fritz, but a continu
ance till 11:30 o'clock a. m., Saturday,
October 7. 1905, was ordered.
Various conjectures as to the cause
of the latest continuance 1 of the oft
continued case were afloat when the
Judge put them all to rout and rest by
announcing : that since the' closing of
arguments by counsel, a week previ
ously, he had not found time to ex
amine the numerous authorities sub
mitted by the defense in effort to prove
that to lie In' wait for a man and then
inflict a knife wound over his heart is
nothing more than simple assault, if it
is Quite that. v \u25a0* *
Among the surmises ventured in the
corridor as possibly explanatory of the
continuance were (1) that a relative of
the court Janitor was ill, (2) that the
senior court bailiff was absent, (3) that
the elevator man had gone to luncheon
and one of the attorneys in the case
dfd not like to walk upstairs. So often
had postponement of the hearing been
occasioned by the non-appearance o%
needed counsel* that the latter guess
was winning many believers when the
court's announcement shattered it and
all others.
In an unrented cottage on Chatham
street, between Stockton and Powell,
numerous male opium ' slaves' noc
turnally foregathered and held, such
weird orgies as to banish slumber from
rear apartments of the Chesterfield.

of Bush street. > Complaint from,; the

Patrolman -Hlnes to the place of *revr
elry and- resulted in the capture of
Chester O. Mason, whose companions
fled back to their officially authorized
habitat, which is Chinatown. ' - -
When the officer invaded the cottage*
he informed Judge Mogan, the scene
that confronted him was suggestive
of a Hogarth drawing or the beggars'
wassail described by Burns. The at
mosphere was densely laden with
opium fumes, and "hop-heads" in vari
ous stages of drug-inspired exaltation
of spirit were making pandem^m^u'rn^-'
some singing, some dancing,' some
weeping, some laughing. The small
apartment was fairly packed with
them. And how they all eluded arrest,
with the single exception of Chester O.
Mason could only be explained by the
semi-darkness and their .surpassing
agility. They must have Vanished
through doors and. windows with. re r
mark-able speed,' for after 'th'e officer
had secured possession of Chester O.
Mason he sought to augment his catch,
but found nothing catchable.
.Chester 0.. Mason, about -'5 years of
age, tattered and wild-eyed, then in
quired If any communication anent
himself had passed- between the Chief
of Police and the Judge. "What I want
to know," he said, "is whether Jhe
Chief is to call on "you or you are* to'
visit him. He' personally notified me
last ' evening that' he -"\u25a0 would arranges *

"When you have slept- twenty-foui

Delighted With Peo
ple and Their
Customs.
Among the passengers recently arrived
en Uie steamer Sonoma was Mr. W. B.
\u25a0Leffingwell, a prominent journalist of
Chicago, accompanied by his wife and
eister, Mrs. M. 8. LeQngwell, who have j
recently completed an extensive tour 1
through New Zealand. \u25a0
Mr. l^effingwell visited that country as
a representative of a syndicate of
many of the largest newspaper and mag
azines in America; deputed to write of
the climate, laws, social and commercial
eijitus of that country. He expresses
himself as delighted with what he saw
and heard, and regards New Zealand as
the must charming: country in all the
world, a colony destined to future great
ness and one which the civilized world
dots now, and will further approve and
compliment when once its attractions
are better known. Mr. Leffingwell has
been absent from America for over four
months and had ample opportunity to
siudy New- Zealand lin all the varied
scenes and conditions.
In reply to interrogations propounded
him at the St. Francis Hotel by a re
porter of The Call, Mr. Leffingwell eaid:
Tou as-k roe my impressions of New Zealand.
I .scarcely know how to reply; for, as you
know, there are times In every one's life when
wordt> are inadequate to express one's senti
ments â limes when tiie mind is stilled \u25a0 In
rapture and the heart Is ti/o full for utterance.
When our 6teamer entered the harbor at
Auckland I saw one, of the most picturesque
eights that the eye is permitted to gaze upon.
The breaking 6ty had given away to the ris
ing eun, and the tun, glinting on the floating
clouds, turned its shafts of gold to hills and
mountains which reciprocated their beauty by
changing to scenes of various shades of green.
It must be from ten to twelve miles from the
time the steamer enters the mouth of the har
bor until we landed at the wharf. And during
fell this time we passed through the channel
protected by great high hills and cliffs. In
the distance we saw the picturesque city,
pestling Hi peace and quietness, in gentle
barnicny with its environment. Imagine a
background of deepest green, water with mirror
smoothness and reflection, and then a city
with houses In pink with red roofs and you
fcave in your mind's eye Auckland, the first
to reach cf the many beautiful cities New
Zealand possesses.
BEAUTY GROWS OX HIM.
A:. '. v.i.cr. we reached the shore and In
after days had ample opportunity to visit the
points or varied Interest which abound there,
our first impressions were strengthened and
we \u25a0were loth to leave this charming city of
*Â«,OGO inhabitants, although we were con
stantly advised that the gates ej scenic beauty
had merely been or>ened to us that we might
anticipate the manifold beauties which lafcer
Civ* urovect and did unfold to us.
"And you found New Zealand pictur
esque?" Mr. Lictlinswell was asked and
in response he eaid:
Nature never had and never will have a
rival Tlifc sky, the earth, the mountains,
the streams, the ecngs of birds, may be imi
tated. If they are exceeded they become un
real, therefore a characterization. They can
not be correctly reproduced, for in their re
production there is always absent the charm
of color, life and motion. The familiar quo
tation that nature unadorned is adorned the
most is fully exemplified in New Zealand, and
ore often wonders is passing through it how
to mudi of beauty and scenic charm oould
be * placed in -i>'anrjÂ» extending a thousand
miles in length as the crow flies and com
prising l^i.ooo square miles of surface.
Kotorua Is one of the great centers which
attract the tourist, the traveler and the seeker
alter health. Tbere, in a sense, the history
of the colony begins, for the Maoris, the
r.ttives of the country, are there In large set
tlements, and by their aboriginal customs and
mode, cf iife afford constant amusement, in
terest, retrospective and progressive thought
es to their future. Their picturesque poi
dancers, their weird and plaintive tangels.
their burial services and mourning for the
o<aii. a!l afford scenes of great interest. They
are a happy people and the stranger is in
variably greeted with pleasant smiles and
audible salutations of "Kia-Ora," "Kia-Ora"
â meaning "Good luck." "Good luck." They,
however, are an incident to the place, living
there because their ancestors did and cooking
their meals In the boiling pools and spending
a good share of their time in the warm pools
\u25a0which nature has heated, tempered to degrees
celightlul to the human race.
SOMB WOXDERFUL SPRIXGS.
There, are famous hot springs , in New Zea
land, es you doubtless know, famous fa New
Jieaiand lor their curative qualities, famous
for the handiwork of the Creator and for the
appalling t-en&e one feeis as one stands at their
n.ica brinks ar.d feels the short distance
\u25a0which exists between life and- eternity. The
Government has recognized the importance of
their preservation and all is under govern
mental control. These boiling springs and
pocls, covering as they do acres and acres
of ground, must, like exuberant children,
burst forth and work off their surplus energy.
A t-pim of unrest prevails and deep In the
I* â¢\u25a0â¢â¢<'.> of the earth a ruuttiiring sound l&
heard. It r*:vertjerates like dfctant thunder;
a, thousand Catling guns seem to emit their
staccato reports, an upheaval of boiling water
rolls rpapiiiixUraily over the surface of the
mouth or a gpys-.r. then it rlsis higher and
higher until t-!>e< tators Etsnd in silent adora
lion and a;::azeir.ert a>= the volume of watej
Â»=!joots hur>3rc-ds 01 f?et high and the mist
drifts from the apex to be beautified by the
Wen. which converts it into rainbow forms.
Mr. Lefnngwoll was asked whether all
tiie country in the vicinity of Rotorua
5s lilu! this. lie said:
Oh. ho. Indeed; this is merely p. sample of the
iCiosyaerasy of natuit. From Rotoiua a day's
journey will urine you to scenes of equally
grett interest, .but of a far diflerent nature.
Ac an Illustration, to th" extinct viilaKer of

largest in the world. The crater is two
acre* in extent and it throws a volume of
water, mud and stones flora ICOO to 1500 feet

You must not think, however, that New
Zealand is compcrf-d principally of such scenes
fc* I have just depicted, for there are millions

XO BUTTER SHIPPED HITHER.
They probably ship no butter to" America.
They are desirous ot doing so, for they feel
that here is the natural market. The tariff
prevents it, so they ship a distance 'of ' twenty
thousand miles to- England instead of one
quarter that distance to San Francisco.
They want to do business with the people of
America. They like us. they like our goods.
They Import millions of dollars of .them annu
ally, and they like our business methods:. They
have opened the door for' the exchange of
products. They admit, free of duty, our agri
cultural Implements, sewing machines, kero
sene oil and many other things; have a mild
and not prohibitive tariff on boots and shoes
and necessities, and. hope and believe that the
day is not far distant when our great country
will let down the tariff bars to an extent that
will enable them to come in with their butter
and cheese, their lamb, their, mutton, their
wool and manufactured woolen goods. All
they ask is the opportunity to show the Amer
ican public what New Zealand produces " and
to do business with a people for whom they
entertain the highest admiration and fraternal
feeling. -:- - â¢ -
Of the scenery along the Wanganni
River Mr. Leffingwell said: .
Words were never coined which could ex
press the mapniiieence and the charm of that
picturesque stream. As I went down "that
beautiful river It seemed like a dream, so rav
ishing that I sorrowed when the trip was over
â when the mesmeric effect of \u25a0 nature's spell
was removed â and then all that was left to
me was a memory. For one hundred and fifty
miles a narrow river is. walled In by precipit
ous mountains clothed wltn a foliage impene
trable to the eye and frequently Impossible to
the foot of. man. Palms t>f immense eize with
serrated leaves drooped: with stately grandeur
and nodded and bowed" to Us when "disturbed
by the midday breeze.' .
Now and then, a tiny, waterfall burst forth
as we passed the .mountain side . and \u25a0 shot out
in 6ilvery stream and trickled down through
moss and tern and pat terra and made pretty
globules In the silent stream. - Now the water
was deep and rellectant and great high . wall*
frowned upon us.itKe dank moss in velvet sreen
clung like a rreat curtain on^the brown wall
of stone, and then, gwirt, rushing, gurgling
rapids appeared, through which our little
steamer glided like an anim from the archer's
bow. .... . . \u25a0 ......
I am a lover, of nature, and I drank silently
these many sceneb of beauty not surpassed \u25a0If
equaled . in all this great, wide world. \u25a0 And
then, \u25a0 right â¢ close to the . t>oat, for the stream
was less than a hundrsd teet wide, I heard a
flutter of wings , and a cock . pheasant sprung
from v hie lair, gained Impetus by a few rapid
strokes of wings and then Bailed majestically
past. I saw his eye looking into mine, not in
terror, but inquisitively; his coat of red and
brown and mottled gold floated past me and
dropped silently amid the ferns, and -I, a tres
passer on his' domain, said. "Good luck to you,
old chap", as his form dissolved from view. .
The river was' a delignt, seen, appreciated,
but beyond my power of description. You un
derstand I have been telling you about the
North Island. Crossing Cooks Strait and going
through . the South Island, scenes of equal
charm are found. Mount Cook .Is one of . the
highest and grandest in the world. Buller
Oorge Is unsurpassed tn grandeur, and at Mil
ford Sound there is a combination of the sub
lime and the beautiful beyond ' expression. -
' A GREAT EXPOSITION ,

admission Is discreditably true, the denial more
discreditably false. Every man who 'voted for

ALL ARE TAKING
KEEN INTEREST
PARIS, Oct. 4.â Chancellories here and
throughout Europe are taking.the keenest
interest in the. positive and even probable
formation, of a new European alliance'
consequent upon; the termination of the
war and. the conclusion of a closer Anglo
ifepanese alliance. ! This has been ad
vanced beyond discussion in the newspa
pers and has already reached the stage of
discreet diplomatic soundings. /The pro
posed realignments of European powers
are divided into three main "movementsâ
nr3t, British inclination j toward an ac
cord with .Russia; second, ; ;a German
movement for, an alliance, offsetting . the
Anglo-Japanese alliance; and :| third, \u25a0 Rus
so-German overtures , to induce France to
Join the latter grouping. ;
Great Britain's desire for a rapproche
ment with Russia has brought about the
distinct diplomatic suggestion j that Great
Britain bÂ« ready to give fuller recognition
to Russia's privileged position:: in South
ern Turkey, notably at Constantinople
and along the Bosphoru3. ' Russia's ambi
tions In that direction have heretofore en
countered strong opposition In; England.
The view in. French official quarters is
distinctly favorable to an : Anglo-Russian
rapprochement. It was one of the projects
of M. Delcasse when Foreign Minister to
have King Edward: visit Emperor; Nich
olas as a means for -furthering the recon
ciliation of Russia and Great Britain.
Concerning the proposed German Rus
sian agreement strong "elements in, both
countries favor an accord as a; counter
poise to. the Anglo- Japanese alliance. The
Temps to-night prints an' authorized ~ In
terview with Prince von; Bulow, the Ger
man Imperial Chancellor at Baden Baden;
openly advocating a 'German-Russian
rapprochement. \
In connection with French participation
In the Russo-German rapprochement itca n
be j definitely stated V;that France, before
considering a new alignment of the pow
ers, intends to await the final determination
of the controversy with regard to Moroc
co,; in which country Germany first inter
rupted the French programme. 'Afterward
France might consider German overtures,
but until Morocco's / future is assured
French bonds of sympathy will I continue

JORDAN TELLS
OF HIS TRIP
Discusses English Univer
sities in Address to the
Stanford Undergraduates
TEAINING SUPERFICIAL
British Institutions Fail
to Prepare Men for the
Seal Problems of Life
Special Dispatch to Ths Call.
STANFORD ; UNIVERSITY, Oct. 4.â
Before {one of the largest gatherings of
Stanford University in the history of the
institution. President David Starr Jor
dan /delivered an address this morning
in the assembly hall of the university.
He spoke of the changes and features of
Europe" which impressed him^ during his
summer \u25a0 tour.
The feature which struck Dr.. Jordan
most forcibly was the rapid moderniza
tion of old historical landmark* for tha
purpose of rendering them morÂ« acces
sible: to , tourists. In .' connection with
this theme the head of the university
read a humorous account from an East
ern publication. The change in the'as
pect of the people of England 1 was
especially, marked. The entire commun
ity of the British Isles eeem to be at a
stage when they, are at a loss to ac
count for a depreciation In their prestige
and are busily engaged In attempting to
solve the mystery.
Regarding tha universities of England,
the , learned â¢ traveler had much to com
ment on. The most important difference
between English and American Institu
tions, he stated, lies in the difference in
the basis from which students are judged
as eligible to receive degrees. In regard
to this phase. of the continental universi
ties Dr.. Jordan said in part:
Two jrreat weaknesses are evident In tha
EneJiah university Â»ystem. First, thÂ» preval
ence of sinecures. Half the men supposed to
teach or conduct research do nothing of tha
kind. As om* Oxford man expresses tt. "They
draw their stipends and simply aoak."
The other -la the dominance of the Â«amta
atlcn. Air the work Is, don* with reference
to the examination. The probable character of
the question* determines everything else. The
examination la tha whole curriculum; hence.
Engllsn" higher i training Is largely superficial,
a matter of books and words," "the men learn
ing to make- a good- appearance, but without
power or skin to adapt ;tbemselvÂ«s to new con
ditions or to meet the more searching and mora
varied examination : /offered ujf thÂ« duties of
life. This la ths secret of tb* success of
American engineer*-/ In 'â¢ London.", They arÂ«
ready lor whatever -turns up-â w>i for- tha parÂ»
ticular problem It '< has taken' three months to
cram. V.~-4tf>gi*s&'<.?-' . '
From the Oxford paptr. called the Vanity.
I take these words:
'â¢Oxtord gives, and please heaven -will con
tinue to give, a social hallmark and training
such as no other place In the world can oiler,
and happy are they who can avail them
selves thereof. Dat when we come to, look the
hard - facts of dally bread and butter In the
face, then it Is that many of us wish we , had
not spent three or four previous years In ac
quiring that which, though aeiectabla enough
In itself, as a commercial or monetary asset
Is of peculiarly, small valua."
In speaking of athletics. Dr. Jordan
drew some interesting and' humorous
ccrdparisona. He said: . \u25a0
I was interested in phases of English ath
letics. -Among other things is a cricket tour
nament, county against county. A gam* lasts
about a wÂ«Â«k. ana "while it Is on In the county
all other I activities are * practically suspended.
In Canterbury when Kent plays Surrey not a
room is lo tw had by an outsider in hotel or
boarding-house. \u25a0
I saw a section of a game on Kennlngton
oval, between- Surrey and Middlesex. Besides
the skill of tha bowlers and batsmen, cms li
most 'lmpressed by the gentlemanly leisure of
the game, the fielders are too polite to hurry,
and if by chance a man is caught out on a
fly the attitude ta one of profuse apology. If
a bowler is too vwlfc for a batsman tha chances
are that he will retire, with bow of depreca
tion. When a man is out he walks with dig
nity to tha . clubhouse, notifies his successor,
who steps to his place . in about ten minutes.
No unseemly ~ haste, and, what is better, no
unseemly- guying-. An English - athlete is too
much of a man to guy an opponent or to dis
pute an umpire.
As in cricket the ball may be struck in any
direction,' backward \u25a0\u25a0 as well as forward, the
audience Is very t far trovn the center of the
game. A tenderfoot in England accustomed to
baseball cannot see who is doing the playing
nor very clearly what is done. But the Eng
lish spectator understands whether he sees or
not. and any man about you can "put you
wise>" in a minute.
\u25a0 The most un-American leature of the gamÂ«
Is the afternoon tea. The play stops at about
4 o'clock, the players all adjourn to the club
house and tan thousand people are given rain
checks. . '" . ' " \u25a0
' President Jordan spoke very favorably
of the Stanford graduates who are at
present In England. He said:
Stanford men In England are holding their
own. Hover, managing partner of the great
mining firm of Bewick, ilorcicgr & Co., is one
of those to whom' we point with pride. Ex
tremely auccessful also are William A. Prich
ard. 'HO, and James Means, '93, both In busi
ness of their own: Knox, '05,; and Dennis. 'W,
are also well known as mining engineers.
-". Following the address by. the, head of
the university, the students were hon
ored with a few words from Luther Bur
bank, the .wizard of horticulture, who
was present at, the meeting as a guest.
\u25a0\u25a0.-, The - meeting was finally brought to a
close with several rousing yells and col
lege songs.
Declines a Consul Generalship.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 4.â ln a letter
dated at Paris, Stanley. Stoner informs
the ' State i Department that he has de
cided not to accept his appointment as
Consul General, at j Calcutta because, of

PORTRAIT OF MRS. A. MERRIWEATHER GOODLET. MUCH-KSTEEMBD
FOUNDER OF THE U. D. C. WHICH WAS PRESENTED TO THE NATION
AL CONVENTION ON TUESDAY. IT WILL. PROBABLY GO TO RICHMOND.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
Is th^re no law on the statute books
that will protect helpless visitors from
the eternal question, "How do you like
San Francisco?". .
To be sure it's the simpleton's way of
being pleasant, but couldn't something
be done to restrain him? This in behalf
of the visiting Dixie Daughters, who have
been asked the phoenianc question as
often as they have been presented to a
native â which le about a dozen a minute.
The convention met in the Marble room
of the Palace yesterday morning with
the delegates as chipper and cheery as
raeadowlarks. And before the gavel fell
for the business session earnest little
groups here and there betokened the ap
proach of election.
The candidates?
Quite as many as there are delegations,
notably Mrs. J. P. Hickman of Nashville,
Term.. now secretary general: Mrs. Liz
zie G. Henderson of Mississippi, now
chairman of the credentials committee,
&nd Mrs. Cornelia B. Stone of Texas, with
a dark horse outside of the paddockâ
and if you Eho* won't tell, I'll tell you,
Mrs. T. J. Latham And there are those
who eajr that she Is very liable to put
c bad fracture in the slate.
To an outsider, however, it would seem
that Mrs. John P. Hickman Is the strong
est candidate, barring Mrs. . Cornelia
Eton* of Texas. That Texas delegation
Is the most formidable in the convention,
wielding more votes than any other two
delegations, and it stands pat for its can
didate. And thus It looks as If there
\u25a0will be some fun -when balloting time
comes round.
The actual session of the morning
opened with a prayer by airs. A. T.
Smythe. Llko all sessions of women's
organizations tho time was largely oc
cupied in reading reports that recited
much Irrelevant and Immaterial matter
In .order to get at the gist of the thing.
Bat the State reports demonstrated a
eplenfild growth through the year.
Mayor Schmltr.was announced and pre
sented, bringing with him the golden
keys of the cityâ Just a day late. But
his tactful little speech saved him nicely.
The only real lively thing that hap
pened was the discussion that followed
the reading of the California Club's In
vitation to the convention to attend the
reception to-night at the new clubhouse. \u25a0
Sirs. James Henry Parker of New
York and others thought that the busi
ness session to-night should not be inter
fered with, since there was much busi
ness to ' put through and little ! time to
do It; so ebe suggested that the Invita
tion be declined with profuse thanks.
Mrs. Sidney Van Wyck and Mrs. Can
trell of Kenâ tucky (that Is how. it's pro
nounced In the Marble room) thought tfie
declination sounded a trifle discourteous,
and moved for reconsideration. Mrs.
Cantrell was ably seconded, and won out.
Bo the Daughters of Dixie will be guests
at the new clubhouse to-night, being
scheduled to arrive about 10:30.
As yesterday, the luncheon was the
most alluring feature of the session, and
was served In the Maple room, and was
admirably \u25a0 attended.
â¢The afternoon was given over to a trip
to Mount Taroalpais, where the splendid
panorama of the city encircled by bay
and ocean spread out bef&re the visitors.
This was pronounced the real treat of the
social Bide of the conventionâ but wait
for the Charity Ball. That will cut some
figure In the aggregate of pleasure. To
this, every delegate is Invited, and the
cards of admission may be obtained from
Mrs. Eugene B. Grace.
This morning a memorial service to the
honored dead will take precedence over
the business session.
The afternoon will be given over to the
Jefferson Davis Chapter, which becomes
hostess for the day at a reception at
the St. Vrancis. And thus goes the time
right' merrily on. __ , \ i

FREIGHT RATES
ON LIVE STOCK
Chicago Dealer Gives Inter
esting Testimony Before
the Commerce Commission
CHICAGO, Oct. 4.â Lively interest
was evoked by W. S. Tasker of Chi
cago, a livestock commission dealer
and cattle feeder, wsho testified before
the State Commerce Commission to
day regarding freight rates on live
stock and livestock products from Mis
souri river ooints to. Chicago. Tasker
.testified that on one occasion he
shipped. a herd of cattle from points in
Western Wisconsin to Chicago by way
of St. Paul at a much less freight rate
than he could have shipped the live
stock direct to Chlcajro. The tariff
from the Dolnts where he shipped in
Wisconsin to Chicago was 26 cents a
hundred. By shipping .to South St
Paul and thence to Chicago he was
able to obtain a rate of 15^ cents per
hundred pounds, although the distance
the commodity had to be transported
was about 300 miles farther than by
the direct route.
"How did .you manage to "get that
rate for your cattle by way of South
St. Paul 7" Inquired Attorney Seaverns
of the Chicago Great Western Rail
road.
"By through billing, I suppose. I
arranged with a livestock, commission
dealer In South St. Paul to have it done
for me," replied the witness.
" "That low proportionate rate be
tween South St. Paul and Chicago was
only intended for cattle shipments oon
signed to Chicago from points In Mon
tana, the Dakotas and Minnesota, and
you knew it, did you not?" asked the
railroad attorney.
"Yes." '
Then as a matter of fact you entered
into a conspiracy with the commis
sion man to manipulate the billing so
that cattle received in South St. Paul
from Western points and sold there
would appear to have~ been shipped
through to Chicago, while your. cattle
were substituted under! the pretense
that they were really the animals
shipped through."
"I suppose that- was the .way it was
done. I understood the same thing had
been done before."
Another Advance in Oil Prices.
PITTSBURG. â¢ Oct. 4. â The Standard
Oil Company to-day advanced the price

Â£uffererÂ« From . Skin OUeoiei
Can find relief, and in .95- per" cent of
cases "a cure, by the use of Hydrozone

preparations are' indorsed and "success

country and should not be confounded

GOMEZ TALKS ABOUT CUBA
Says Liberty Is Dead Jind Af

Were Under Spanish Eule
BLAMES UNITED STATES
Eecent Candidate for Presi
1 dency of Island Eepublic
Paints a Dark Picture
NEW YORK, Oct., 4â "Liberty is dead
in Cuba and the condition of affairs there
Is worse than it ever was under Spanish
rule, even in the most ferocious periods
of the Weyler Government. Financial
ruin and dishonor face the. people. 'If
things continue as they are the nation
will be converted into one of hereditary
rule."
That declaration was made last night
by General Jose Miguel Gomez, Governor
of the Province of Santa Clara and can
didate of the Liberal party 'J. or the Pres
idency of Cuba, at the New Amsterdam
Hotel, where he is stopping. Upon his ar
rival on the steamship from
Havana yesterday General Gomez refused
to discuss Cuban affairs at length, but
after he had rested at his hotel he* was
more communicative.
"I am here to rest for some days," he
continued, "arid to breathe the air of lib
erty that is lacking in my. own country
and for which I have fought so long.
On false charges the Government assassinates
the Liberals, the jails 'are filled, with political
prisoners, and we have no hope of Justice from
judges and magistrates who recognize no law
but the will of the Government. .We are hin
dered In casting our votes and Cuba is now
suffering a reign of terror never equaled under
Spanish tyranny.
For what -Is happening, in Cuba the. United
States Government has a direct responsibility.
Palma is enabled to do as he Is doing only,
by telling the people every day that In case of
revolution or disorder the United States would
ssnd troops \u25a0to punish them and to sustain
the Palma Government. ' -
If the United States should Intervene in the
matter of the elections and insist that these
eleclons should be carried on honestly it would
be proved that 80 per cent .of the population
are Liberals. That proportion of the [ people
hate Palma and his oppressions worse than
they hated Weyler, for the conditions he has
enforced are worse than ever I existed under
Spanish dominion. I
Bwfnre leaving Cuba General Gomez
tendered his resignation as candidate for
President, in order, as he said; to give the
convention full liberty in its proceedings.
Upon his arrival here lie was informed
that the convention was held last Sunday;
that it had been decided not to accept. the
resignation. General Gomez said that be
fore he could outline his next action he
would have to learn the reasons for this
action by the convention and would have
to elve the matter deep thought.
HAVANA, Oct. 4.â When shown the
statement made yesterday by General
Jose Miguel Gomez, who was a candidate
of the Liberal party | for the Presidency
of Cuba, upon his arrival in New York,
President Palma read them carefully and
returned them with the laconic remark:
"You know very well that these things
are not true." '
General Frey Andrade, Minister of the.
Interior, emphatically denies all the alle
gations made by General Gomez. He says
that nobody was in any manner re
strained from voting at the recent pri
maries and points out that the original
strength : of the Liberal . party dwindled
rapidly when its leaders used inflamma
tory methods, â¢ while in the- meantime the
followers of General Nunez became strong
allies of the Moderate party, | rendering
the Gomez camp hopeless. Thirty-four
men have been- arrested : by rural es in
San Juan y Martinez province of Pinar
del Rio, -charged with the seizure of a
ballot-box, but.the majority of them
were released. The box was recovered.
The Italian Minister, Orestes Savina,"
has protested to the authorities against
what he charges to be the unfair treat
ment of Italian subjects. by local officials
because of alleged participation in elec
tion affairs. The Government has in
structed all Mayors to scrupulously re
spect the rights of foreigners..

the Confession oi Bunker^
in the Trial of i JEmmons
DEFENSE NEAR, THE END
Mitcheltree Said to : Have
, Tried to Borrow, : Money
During Legislative Session
SACRAMENTO^ Oct. Lâ The trial of
ex-Senator \E. J. Eminons, on the charge
of bribery, developed some sensational
features during the , session - to-day. The
defense has concluded its case, although
several \u25a0witnesses are held in reserve to
answer the rebuttal of the > prosecution,
which commenced to-day. It is believed
that the ca3e will be submitted and ready
for argument 'about Friday, and there is
expressed _a ' hope . that . the trial, which
has-been in- progress nineteen days, will
conclude by the â¢\u25a0 end of next week.
Ex-Senator Eli Wright, who Is also ac-;
cused of bribery, j was the main -witness
for the defense. After Wright,' in re
sponse to questions by Attorney ' Grove
L. Johnson, had testified to .. every
cumstance,' move, conversation and meet
ing during the early part of- the last leg
islative session and had denied absolute
ly Uhe conversations and actions attrib
uted to him in the confession of Bunkers,
he was' asked; about the first meeting of
the committee, fj He said that he â¢ left the
house at " 817 ' Tenth street under *an um
brella^: which : sheltered himself and
Charles: Hogg. He was positive that
there had been :no talk about money o.r
graft. ' v
"Wright said that he knew; Fayette
Mitcheltree, an Assemblyman from San
ta Clara County,, and was asked if he
remembered a conversation with Mitch
eltree. Prosecuting Attorney Seymour
stated that the purpose of this Inquiry
was "to* show ' a combination' among the
four Senators afterward indicted. Ob
jection was made to the admission of any
such testimony from Wright relating to
any' conspiracy.
-The objection was finally overruled and
the question was repeated as follows:
. "Do you remember having had a con
versation with Mitcheltree in the Golden
Eagle Hotel about three days prior to the
expose?" ' â¢
Wright said, he did not remember the
occasion, and affirmed that Mitcheltree
was but seldom in attendance at the ses
sions lof the Legislature. The witness
would not fieny having had such a con
versation and Seymour asked: "Did you
not say to him. 'A combination has been
formed by French, Emmons, Bunkers and
myself to make some money out of the
building - and loan associations?' ". .
"No, sir:' l never had such a conversa
tion with Mitcheltree or any one else.
If he said so. he is guilty of a deliberate
and willful prevarication." -
"Did you not state that . you had
subpenaed \u25a0William Corbin and that you
were going to force him to come up?
\u25a0 An objection to this was : sustained.
Then Seymour asked: "Did you not
state to Mitcheltree that if you had
known you were doing business with
a man like Jordan you would have been
more careful^'and-tha^ ltÂ£looked 3 as if
It would cost> you â¢more *to 'get clear
than you had gotten out of it?" - ,?
1"I did not say such a thing. to him.
I did \u25a0 have . a conversation, ,wlth him;
however. It was not in the hall, but
in the lobby, near the heater. Mitchel
tree came to me and said he was about
to be indicted for embezlement from
a piano house by'whlch he had been
employed. l He wanted to borrow $300
to help him* out, and I told- him I was
in trouble myself and needed all I had.
Then he wanted $200, and finally came
down to $100. I refused to let. him
have it. and he has been mad at me
ever since." ' - . \-
J6*hnson made a motion, to strike out
all the testimony. the witness had given
with reference to the conversation with
Fayette Mitcheltree. Seymour op
posed, but after an extended review of
the situation Judge Hart granted the
motion and instructed the Jury not to
heed any, evidence on 'this point. \
After being asked some minor ques
tions, . Wright : was I excused and Em
mons, who had been tinder examina
tion nearly all. of yesterday, was re
called by Johnson. , Answering his
counsel's -;questiori, Emmons said there
was never; any. mention of the Renters'
Building and , Loan Association at the
meeting at which , the committee .':orÂ£
ganlzed. â¢ â¢ '"--v-^ '.
Emmons stepped . from the witness
, stand and? Johnson announced .that the
defense closed its case, except for call
ing Attorney Bert Schlesinger of San
Francisco, !a^ character . witness, and
James L. Flaniiigan of. this city." John

THURSDAY OCTOBER 5. i<^s
A TALKING PERIOD.
TIME was that men who improved official opportunity for the
purposes of private and illicit gain were governed by the cele
brated Pennsylvania rule of "Addition, Division and Silence/!;
As long as that rule was followed grafting flourished until it be
came a regular business and its detection was almost hopeless. The
only time that a select circle was broken into without any .one talk
ing\vas when Tilden broke a hole in the Tweed ring in New York,
and by a system of deduction from the passing of checks and the
transfer of bank accounts not only found out the gross amount of,
the peculations of the ring, but the proportion- in which, the sum
was divided. These revelations sent Mayor Oakey Hall, into exile
and Tweed to jail.
When Mr. Joseph Folk began operations against the grafters
in St. !^x:is he had only surface indications. He was a sort of legal
prospector. He expose^ a ledge, but was unable to assay it until
fccxnc. of the grafters began to talk. When the talk started, fear and
conscience loosened many tongues; and the clatter of talk became
almost confusing to the courts, and nearly disabled the prospector
with an embarrassment of riches. In fact some of the talkers talked
eg much that deductions based upon their extreme vocal liberality
led courts and juries somewhat astray, and we believe the Supreme
Court of Missouri has voided some of the resulting verdicts and
cases have been sent back, to have the surplus of talk squeezed out
of them in order that results in form more in accordance with the
law may be reached.
In the Senatorial boodle cases in Sacramento everything was
quite airtight until Jordan talked. More recently Bunkers has talked,
end now Mr. Emmons is delivering a Counter talk, in which it- is
probable. that he is saying too much for his own safety, since Dis
trict Attorney. Seymour is evidently encouraging his desire to con
verse, and out of the mass will appear contradictions that will count
against the astute witness, who is also the prisoner at the bar.
The epidemic of talk has extended until one witness has talked
under oath about three Senatorial elections, in which he declares
money was used to enable members of the Legislature to see more
clearly the merits andtalents of candidates for that high office. Out
fide of the case on trial, more talk has bubbled up like the medical
mud at Byron Springs. Two prize fighters, or promoters of that
intellectual pursuit, grown rancorous toward each other, have talked
about a fund that was raised to protect that important industry
against the anti-prize fight bill that was defeated in the last Legis
* lature. . -~
In this embittered talk thousands of dollars figured and were
mentioned as if they had been peanuts, whereupon a representative
from a university town, who led the fight against the bill, is smitten
by the general epidemic and talks of bribes paid to five members for
their votes against the proposed law. He,resorts to talk to clear
himself. His motives in opposing the bill were entirely benevolent.
The measure proposed, as he says, to create a monopoly in slugging
for the benefit of amateur prize fighting. As this State has produced
the Benicia Boy and Corbet* and Jeffries, and as Yankee Sullivan
lived here until the Vigilance Committee made a change of residence
desirable, and as they were all professional prize fighters, the law
was regarded as inimical to an important California industry.
So the talking representative opposed it and found himself in
company with members who opposed it, for a consideration. In his
talk he has confessed their sins with a freedom that is next neighbor
to abandon? and as he has talked to a detective and a Grand Jury
there may be some men who will be thankful for the low tourist
rate advertised by the railroads.
Under the circumstances, it is quite possible that there are
many who are waiting anxiously for a lull in the general conversa
tion, for the talk is not cheap and it arouses apprehensions of the
most painful character.
What if the habit should extend to municipal affairs in this
city! The late Grand Jury had Tilden's task and drew deductions
from facts upon the silent records and from situations and circum
stances. But official protection put a padlock on mouths that under
other circumstances might have been affluent fountains of talk on
subjects painful to the powers that are and that want to be again.
â¢ Mr. Ruef's answer to the Grand Jury was that he does not drink,
hates tobacco like little Robert Reed, and goes home nights, some
times late, but gets there, and that the Mayor has stood by him
"through all." i - .
Just why such an upright citizen as he says he is should re
quire a Mayor to stand by him in his laudable abstention from red
liquor and tobacco and in going humbly and dutifully home has not
been explained. The city will wait until somebody talks, after offi
cial protection of Addition, Division and Silence is withdrawn, and
then his fellow citizens may know at last why Mr. Ruef requires a
Mayor to stand by him in his business.
Meantime the talking statesmen who have begun .may be heard
â¢without putting one's ear to the ground, and many will wish that
the talkers had been born deaf and dumb.
JUVENILE CRIME.
'TpHE startling statement is made by a Superior Judge in this
I city that 95 per cent of the criminals who appear in the courts
\u25a0 arc under age, many of them being in their early 'teens. In
Oakland the Sheriff has undone a gang of boys who began with idle
ness and mischief and went on from petty peculations to burglary,
highway robbery, and finally to murder.
i In several instances it has been found that desperate crimes, at
tributed by the experts to aged, hardened and skillful criminals, have
been committed by mere boys. In ' many of these cases there ap
pears no element of heredity. parents are upright people and
their home surroundings were not noisome. Their parents seem
able to have given them everything but occupation. Lacking that
and its wholsome influence they formed gangs and went into crime.
It is an unpleasant, a fearful thing, this juvenile crime. It 19
rife not only, here, but all over the country, and reeks in every large
city. Foreign immigration fills places in the trades \u25a0 and handi
crafts, so that American boys are not wanted as apprentices, and
their ; natural activity seems, to their immature minds, to have its
natural outlet in criminal adventure. It is extremely doubtful that
boys who have made such entry upon crime can be reclaimed. The
law can protect society against them. But some great effort should
be made to prevent others following in their footsteps.
Unless some means to that end 'be used, the court records of
this city will still bear that awful blur. These juveniles are not
to crime by want, by hunger or by lack of -shelter , The force
that drives them is far different from these necessities. The spec
tacle is as pitiful as it is alarming. Boys born to honor, destined
to be men, citizens and rulers in their generation; of the republic,
lapse into crime, lose r their citizenship and spend their lives oscil
lating between transgression and punishment. '.
The country is losing the strength. its native born sons should
give to it. The loss is duplicate. It is deprived of what they should
give it, and its resources are sapped in their detection, punishment
and' support in prison. We believe that no .other, nation" is making
such a record of juvenile crime/ It shames us and discredits our
institutions. Is there any ; remedy except employment ?

OPTIMISM AND PESSIMISM
WALLACE RICE
AM asked to tell what I think about
the relative" merits of optimism and
* pessimism as points of view from
which to look upon life with an intention
to sc it as a whole. ,
My correspondents seems to think that
one must be committed to one or the oth
er, and not to a combination of both.
When we were at school we were taught
some useful knowledge about what is
called the parallelogram of forces. If a
ball is struck, for example, by two cues
placed at right angles, equal force being
put into the blow from both, it moves
away on a diagonal of forty-five degrees
and to a point much farther than if either
cue were, acting^separately, s â¢
/ This will serve aa'& Bymboi for, 1 all ad
vance, whether by the individual or the
race, i , ', .V l \u25a0 , : \u25a0 â¢ j :'\u25a0\u25a0 â¢
It Is bo in all great movements. Radi
calism is as necessary as conservatism
in this world, if there is to be any true
advance. We proceed not only more sure
ly, but more rapidly by utilizing the two
oppositely exerted forces. And bo It is
with optimism and pessimism.'
The Incorrigible optimist, the ; dweller
at all times within .the best possible of
all possible worlds, is a drag on all re
form and all forward movement. How
can he seek to amend that which is 'al
ready good beyond : the- possibility* of
amendment for 'the better? ; :
So of the inhabitant of the worst pos
sible of all possible worlds. What object
can he have in bettering that which is
already hopelessly beyond betterment?
Jle, too, holds back all true advance.".

must follow; and he will avoid all wild

accepts history, as .a series of mutually
contradictory 'assertions "which;, cancel
themselves : and - leave the sought-f or re

ALBERS CASE DISPUTE
Official Says Evidence Will
Show Americans Were
Wrongfully Incarcerated
. '\u25a0\u25a0:\u25a0- \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 vi : -: -\u25a0- ;-,.:
Chester Donaldson. United States
Consul at Managua, Xicara&ua. arrived
i s'esterday morning on board the steam
er San Juan.-ci, route to Washington,
v. C. to explain personallj' to the De
partment of State the Albers case. The
Consul has with him all the docu
mentary evidence in the matter.
The evidence. Donaldson says, will
show that the two brothers were
\u25a0wrongfully imprisoned, and he intends
to justify the stand he took to gain
liberty.
V.'hf n Donaldson left Nicaragua six
teen riays ago the Americans were still
in prison.
Consul Donaldson, speaking to a Call
representative of the statement made
by Brlce and Forbes on September 27,
said:
In regard to this Brlee and Forbes matter
I can but exprecs my utter astonishment ana
amazement that such & statement could have
cime from the}r lips.
It is more of & surprise to me that men
2J"!'O professed while in Nicaragua to be my
mends and applauded the etaud I took to
protect two fellow- Americans should have re
turned to the United Statts with eiorics
utterly at variance with the facts.
DISCLAIMS PIIEJLUICE.
Brie Â« *Â» i Forbes have elated in The Call
tiÂ«at 'the Albers brothers were wrong and
justly deserved to be behind the bare."
So far Â«s 1 am concerned as an officer of
the Lclted States I ha\e no prejudices one
way or another, my desire being to tee fair
Piey and to demand it for my countrymen.
r\# this Brice and Forbes ccncratulated me
before leaving fcr the United States.
Thpy mary a time told me that I had
taken the ripht etand in the Albers matter
end I then had the satisfaction of feeling that
wy countrymen and friends upheld me in my
*ction.
The statement that the Alberses tried to
"break into" a certain concession granted By
President Zelaya to others Is absolutely lalte.
JÂ« all the accusations made against them there
has never been eny mention of anything oÂ£ the
kind.
The accusations in reality against th*m are
that, first, they resisted the authorities on
February Â£6 last, when the tobacco trust,
backed by the Government, tried. to confiscate
Â«.Â« contraband a larpe quantity of tobacco on
\u25a0Â»-hlch the Albers'-s had paid the Government
\u25a0 Â»tax and held a receipt giving them the right to
k depose of the property In any wav they
fltÂ» ' <\u0084.:.. "
Th* second accusation "was that they had
spoken against the Government and President
Zelaya.
ZELAYA IS FRIEXSLY.
They under oath denied each accusation, and
it setmed to me to be very strange that the
AJbtrses wtre arrested nearly fix months after
Â«w> trouble about the tobacco had been settled
and the authorities had agreed with me that
the Albers^s had a perfect right to the to
bacco and they <tb& authorities) abandoned
their p;Â«n to confiscate it.
That President Zelaya is very friendly to
Americans is perfectly true, but he had been
prejudiced against these two by falss reoortg
emanating from their enemies.
As for my being in "bad odor with decent
ptopie in Nicaragua." the fact about that can
be easily learned by inquiring of Americans
and others who have known m<- there for yeats.
Several of these are in San Francisco to-day
It very much depressed me at the time that
It became necessary for me to take a stand
tor thÂ« protection of Americans, whom I be
lioved to be unjustly treated, that would put
m* in an unfriendly attitude toward the
raÂ£-uan Government.
The statement that Zelaya has done me any
favors financially i s absolutely false. The
assertioa that h was counting upon my friend
\u25a0pip or acquaintance with Secretary of State
Root is regrettably incorrtct. I was not in
col>ge with him. the Secretary having been

ALDEN CLUB WILL ENTERTAIN
IN BEHALF OF SUNSHINE
Arranges for Elaborate Card Party >at the ? St. Francis Hotel
The white and gold room of the St.
Francis will present a picture of anima
tion on Saturday afternoon, when the
Alden Club will give its card party and,
entertainment, the proceeds to help in
its splendid work.
A triple alliance of beauty, social posi
tion and philanthropy has been formed
in the organization of the Alden Club,
whose life of rive years shows a vitality
not often apparent in clubs of a decade's
growth.
The work and aspirations of the Inter
national Sunshine Society arÂ« almost, too
well known to dwell upon and the ac
complishments of the local branch, as
represented by the Alden Club, have been
far-reaching. The membership is large
and composed of many prominent girls
of San Francisco society. They have lent
willing- hands and hearts with an energy
untiring, but the guiding star is Miss
Mabel Adams Ayer, whose mind has ca
pably planned to the extent of obtaining
finest results. She is the State president,
iliss Cecile Roger? filling the office of
corresponding secretary.
Sunshine has certainly been scattered
about generously by the Alden Club.
The needy are warmed and fed and beds
are supported in one or two prominent
hospitals, while many afternoons of so
cial pleasure have been unselfishly relin
quished by a group of maids to go and
read at the Home for Incurables and
other "shut-ins," whose daily life has
been cheered solely by, the presence of
these Sunshine girls. Every town of
mentionable size In the State has a rep
resentative or two. the spirit of the Alden
Club projecting Itself prominently to
each point of the compass.
!n town the public co-operates quickly
lavishly with the motive of the club,
the mercantile world especially having
contributed spontaneously with small re
serve.
Every year Alden entertains by right
and grace of its social position, with fit
ting rooms at its disposal, on Saturday
the St, Francis being donor. â¢
VTlth the financial outcome ever" ln mind
the af ternoon will, nevertheless, be given
over" to unalloyed pleasure, the allure
ments of seven-hand euchre and five hun
dred to engross several hours; and such
a group of .beauty as there will be!
Dozens of tickets have already been
taken, with the dally line steadily in
creasing. Each Alden Club maid has
them to sell, or you may find the same
passports at the Hotel St. Franc!*.' A
dollar will purchase, a ticket, which enti
tles to a whole afternoon of fun, to say
nothing of refreshments, which will be
most daintily served. In this way you are
casting many rays of sunshine, receiving
immediately several reflecting beams to
yourself. .
Mrs. Cynthia Westover Alden, the no
ble founder and president general, Eays
Sunshine is a religion, whose creed is em
bodied In these lines:
Have you a kindness shown?.
. I'sfr it on.
'Twaa not given for you alon*.
'Pss* it on.

BAKERSFIELD. Oct. 4.â At a meeting
of representatives of all the companies in
the' Independent Oil Producers' Agency
of this county,- held this afternon at the
agency offices In the Kern River field,
preliminary plans were laid for uniting
all the independent companies, of the
county into one large company, to which
all the oil land now* in the possession of
the Independent producers will be deeded.
Preliminary plans were also laid for the
construction of two. million-barrel reser
voirs for. the storing of oil.
The object of the independents is. as
far- as can be ascertained, \u25a0' to compete
with the Associated,': to which, company
the agency Is [ now bound Â«^inder, contract
to deliver oil at the wells at 18 rents a
barrel. The contract will be completed in
a few months, and the .evident intention
of. the independents ; is to be prepared at
the fulfillment of the contract to market
the Independent oil at a satisfactory'fig
ure/ Under present conditions the greater
portion of the independent oil is being d<>
livered.to the large, companies, at -a price
that means little if any profit to the pro
ducers, and the preliminary ' action , of, to
day, means the. beginning of a last deter

3 Perfect Chain Woven About
Spender of Stolen Gold
"Edward Cordero, whose arrest for the
"theft of $11,080 from William Schmitz^ an
aged ' German painter residing at ' 741
O'Farrell street, was exclusively told in
The Call Tuesday' morning, is still in the
detention ward of the, Central Emergency
Hospital. It i 3 the opinion of those who
have chargeof him that the man is feign
ing and it 'is - possible he will soon be
returned to his prison cell. Cordero de
veloped .symptoms -of delirium tremens
shortly after, his arrest and when taken
to the hospital became extremely violent.
He fought 5 like a wild beast and -it. be
came necessary to resort to the use of
a straltjacket , to ,-. prevent him * from
doing harm. / Last night he was in the
same condition, but the sincerity of his
attacks are doubted.
-â¢â¢ The police department is still . collect-:
ing evidence in the case, and Detectives
Bunner. and, Freel, who were detailed by
Acting Captain of Detectives Reynolds to
make .the arrest, are weaving a complete
chain of. proof about, the accused. . Mls3
Schmltz still clings to her statement that
she was forced at the point of a revolver
to secure the money from where it had
been concealed- by her parent and give
it to her lover, Cordero. She is specific
as to the amounts and the time and the
police will rely greatly â¢ upon her testi
mony for a conviction. Much corroborat
ive evidence' will; also be" lntroduced.
Cordero's defense will be that the wo
man pestered him with her demonstra
tions of friendship and that, she /gave
him the money voluntarily. Much of the
coin has been lost, but an effort will be
made r to recover what remains of- it. .
i It is not likely that Miss dchmitz will
be arrested, either as a principal in the
crime or as an accomplice. .Her father
believes- her story implicitly and will
swear : to' no. charge against her. The
police will not assume thia responsibility
and the woman is likely to escape without
prosecution for her part in the affair.

\u25a0 Mr Nagle managed to squirm out of |
many : a (Ight hole, when he went up I
against the Seals at the Eighth-street lot \u25a0
yesterday "afternoon.". .Uncle's â¢ collection '
had chances arid â¢ chances . to break up
the game, "but the young man, who is
more used '\u25a0 to tossing twenty-dollar gold I
pieces than the horsehide, manages to
get away from the dangerous places in
a very deft manner. ' .
It looked like the Seals would win any
how, without ;the aid of base hits in the
last two innings, for Bobby Eagar could
not see the ball on account of the sun.
Nearly everything that was thrown got
away from him. :As a finishing spectacle,
the Seals managed, to get Moler on third
and Hildebrand on second, with two
down, In the ninth. It was up to Joe
Xealoh, but he only had an easy grounder
to Flood that put an end, to -the fight
without t further : ceremony.
Bad baseball beat the Seals. In the
opening spasm Flood planted out a single
and stole. iVUddleton raised a
long flyl which .Wheeler, dropped. A double
steal;-,, was pulled off a- moment later.
Mohler. might have thrown Flood out at
the :.'plate," but his heave j was many \ feet
over- Shea's head, so the run â¢ scored
easily. :
The Angels grabbed their last , In the
fourth, when Dillon singled, stole and
came 'in when Cravath' placed one to
right field. The only time the Seals man
aged to put one over was in their half
of the fourth. Mohler bingled and stole,
and'- ; - Hildebrand was passed. Wheeler
shoved .' a slow one at Dillon. " who fielded
it to* first. But Nagle was too slow In
covering the 'bag, so the Kid arrived. -
The Angels had an av/f ul good time in*
stealing bases on Shea during the first
four Innings. After getting away with
seven in rapid succession. Captain Wilson
came in to work himself, seeing that
Shea could not peg 'em around to \ the
bags. Flood led the team in pilfering,
getting away . with, rio less than four. .The

Quarterback Miller of the
Schoolboys Contributes
Only Sensation of Game
The Berkeley^ High School and the
California 1 freshmen . f ouarht out two
scoreless halves ;of football on the uni
versity gridiron yesterday afternoon.
The most spectacular .feature of the
game was a fifty-yard run by Quarter
back Miller of the school eleven after
he. had deftly picked, up the pigskin
from a scrimmage in which It had been
fumbled by the collegians. He had a
clear field and would' have made a
touchdown had he not- been a little
shy on legs. .With this exception the
goal of neither team was In serious
danger during the game.
The youngest generation of , those
born to wear the blue and gold hosiery
played too loosely to win. .The team
contained many men also who have
no chance of getting into the inter
collegiate contest. The babies tried
hard but could not get together for
united action. When the back took the
ball he generally traveled alone.
The schoolboys showed much better
team workand played more spiritedly.
There were several fumbles, and penalr
izations as a result of misguided en
deavor on the part of players In both
teams. â¢ Some of the freshmen dis
played flashes of gridiron genius and
foreign culture which may. be attribut
ed to the new coach. For the whole
of the game the ball did not get more
than ; thirty- five yards from the middle
streak of whitewash. The best play-
Ing, for the school was done by the
fullback and the left tackle. The line

Bis Crowd Sets Remarkable Football
Game at Presidio.
Before the largest crowd that ever
\ witnessed a football game of the local
sub-league, the Polytechnic High School
defeated the team from the California
School of Mechanical Arts (Lick) yea
terday by a score of 5-0. These two
rival teams, which have been In the
; finals for 'the past three years, yester
day fought like demons for every Inch
of the ground, and it was not until the
very last that Polytechnic showed its
superiority. -.
Before the first half closed, th,e Poly
technic boys brought thd ball tÂ«'Lick!s
twenty-yard- line. As time .was short a
full goal was tried, but was a complete
failure. â¢"., Miller, Lick's crack left half,
in some way got through Poly's line
and made a mad rush for the ball,
which hit him en route for the goal
posts. It glanced off and was fallen on
by a Lick man.
In the second half the' men played
fiercer than ever. Main, the Tigers*
captain; made a nne kick-off to Gari
baldi, who was playing on Poly's goal
line. The ball went high and managed
to pass '"Gar i'.' after he had touched it.
However, he recovered himself quickly
and ran the ball in about fifteen yards
and -In doing so received a knock which
almost put him out of the game. The
referee called it a foul and Lick was
given the full penalty.-.
An end run, was tried, which would
certainly have been a touchdown bad it
not been for "Sarah" Hall, who tackled
his man so hard that the Full was
dropped, but .by chance a Lick man fell
on IL Poly got the - : ball on downs
again, ran Ed wards around the end^a
couple sof - times, and with the ball on
Lick's ten-yard line, Garibaldi was sent
through the line for a touchdown. The

BLOOD POISON
Contagiqws Blood Poison more thor-
oughly poisons the blood than any other
disease. Every part of the body is af-
fected when the Tiros becomes intrenched
in the circulation; red , eruptions break
out on the skin, the " mouth and throat
ulcerate, glands in the neck and groins
swell, the hair falls out, copper-colored
splotches appear on the body, etc
I was af&icted with blood poison, and
the beat doctors did me no rood, though
I took th air - treatment faithfully." In
fact I seemed to ret worse all the while.
I took almost every so-called blood rem-
edy, but they did not seem to reach the
disease, and had no effect whatever. 1
was disheartened, for it seemed that I
would never be cured. At the advice oi
a friend I then took S. S. 3. and began to
Improve. I continued the me dioino, and
it cured me completely, mbhmshmm

\u0084 So highly ' contagious is this disease
that many a life has been ruined by a
friendly hand shake or from using the
toilet articles ; of one affected with the
poison. To cure this hideous" and hate-
1 ful disease a constitutional remedy is re-
quired. S. S. S. goes down to the very
root of the trouble and forces out every

cures the disease permanently. ;S. S. S.

UNDERWRITERS
ARE HOPEFUL
Preparations for Floating
Stranded Alameda Are
Progressing- Favorably
STILL EESTING EASILY
Powerful Pumps and. Other
Apparatus for Clearing
Hull Are Being Installed
The preparations for floating / the liner
Alameda are progressing favorably and
with the continuance of fine weather the
underwriters are still ' hopeful that their
efforts in the end ; will : spell success. \u25a0 The
Oceanic Steamship Company has aban
doned the vessel to the underwriters, at
whose expense and under whose direction
the efforts to pave | the ship are being
made.' . . .' '
Floating a water-logged steel liner is a
big undertaking,; and : the preparations
take time/,, In ; the 'first place a search
has. to bo made by divers for holes in the
ship's skin. These holes have to be
stopped up and -as this work has to be
done under water the task is one of diffi
culty and takes time.
When the holes have been plugged as
effectively as possible, the hull has to be
cleared of i water and to do i-is powerful
wrecking pumps must be Installed. These*
pumps are. big. and heavy. Transporting
them from shore to stranded' ship and in-,
stalling . them on board the vessel is
something of a job in itself. . But this is
not | nearly all . the labor Involved In the
underwriters' task. Steam is needed to
operate these pumps. -Boilers must be
taken out and installed in which to ; gen
erate the f steam. To i make steam fresh
water Is necessary. -."Water has to be car-,
ried out. ;The water musSbe' sto-red, and
for this purpose huge steel tanks have to
be- loaded .on -lighters, .towed \u25a0\u25a0 to . the
stranded ; vessel and hoisted * on I '' board.
Then I there 1 is; the question of , fuel. The
Alameda burns oil. . The furnaces under
the underwriters' boilers are, not adapted
for ."Hauid" fuel, so' coal must . be shipped

SHOWS GROWTH
OF THE MINES
Increase of 1904 Is Equal
to That of Three Years
That Just Preceded It
MAKES STATE EEPOET
Mineralogist Aubury : Tells
â¢of Petroleum's Advance
to Place tfext to Gold
The mineral products of California in
1904, reports i State Mineralogist Aubury,
were worth $Â«.019,308 more than those
of the preceding , year. The value in tor
tal for ; 1904 -was $43,T73,34S and for 19Q3
it was $37,750,008. The total value of the
metallic substances ' mined in this State
in ; 1904. including precious metals, wa3
$25,114,699. Among the substances _ that
receive special mention are gold,' silver,
pyrites, -quicksilver, copper, lead, 'manga
nese platinum and . chrome. The ; . total
value" of non-metallic substances mined
was 52,131,369.
An Interesting etatement made by , the
State Mineralogist is that petroleum has
I taken ' the second place in value of the
substances of California. Gold
'is first, copper third, clays and their
: products fourth; ~ cement fifth, rubble
sixth . and " quicksilver seventh.
The output of cement reached a total ;
of 969,538 barrels in ' 1304 and the value is
I fixed at $1,500,000 in round figures. The
i total value of one year's output of struc
: tural materials was $7,274,846. The hydro
i carbons, including asphalt, bltunminous
' rock, natural gas and petroleum* . were
valued at J9.207.434. It would take prac
tically - 30,000,000 barrels, to hold the pe
troleum taken from California oil wells
in 1904.-, '.. .
The leading item of mineral production
in 1904 was, as naturally might be;sup
: posed, gold, and this represented
'< $19,103,600. The copper amounted to
j 29.974,154 pounds, worth $3,969,995 in total.
A fact that \u25a0 will surprise many is that
the rubble output was worth more than
'the quicksilver and that the clays made
a better showing than quicksilver by
$1,000,000,' in round .figures. Quicksilver is
now produced in Colusa, Lake, Napa,
San Benito. .San Luis Oblspo, Santa
Clara,. (Solano, Sonoma and Trinity
counties.
The general showing made for the min
eral industry of California ; for the year
KO4 is that the" increase was greater
than for' any one of many years past,
the usual increase for ten years having
been about $2,000,0000 a year, .or $4,000,000
less than that of 1904. â¢

\u25a0 NEW YpRK, Oct. 4.âNotwithstand
ing a desperate struggle J oÂ£- hl3.i wife
and son. to .hold him by the feet' after
he had fainted and toppled- over- the
sill ' of ;an open * window, George F.
Kraepp, cashier of the Cooper Exchange
Bank, fell to the street from the fourth
floor of .'his home at 209 "West Ninety
seventh street to-day and was killed.
: Mrs. Kraepp and ' her son, Herbert,
saw Kraepp. who was -in v ill ; health,
Suddenly fall over ' backward. Mother
and son jumped to the window in time
to' seize the! falling ;Â«an by the feet.
They held him safely, for. a few seconds",
screaming -for help, but the assistance
was slow in coming and Kraepp's
weight began to pull him away from
his rescuers. The realization of this
terrible fact caused the wife's strength
to desert her completely j and . the . son,
with his mother - helpless at* his side,
was compelled to hold his father alone
and was too light for his father's - su
perior weight. Exhausted and on the
point of being dragged over the win
dow-sill himself, the boy lost r his grip
and Kraepp fell to the street. He died
soon afterward. He was 52 years of
age. ' v

Wall-Street Tips.
Brokers* wires froia New Tork yesterday
6TOCKS.â The sharp advance in the call
taoney rate early this afternoon to 7% per
cent was the reeult or further calling of loan*
oj\ basks and trust companies and it turned
iaqt-*&arket from a position of strength to ir
raPxaxlty and weakness later on. In which
price* or the general list declined %Â®l' per
Â©ent. We etlll believe the. general market will
be kept !& good shape by th* Interests which
tiav # been protecting It during the last month,
sui4 alter we have come out of the present
saoney etrlngeKcy we will undoubtedly soa
vltlmattly hither prices.
COTTON. â Bully's advice is as follows^
"Bureau misleading. Advise tnrtrr boldÂ«r to
â¢â¢-and fast and not sell for twenty days. Crop
is unquestionably a short one. Fully 65 per
cent picked, aomethijig unheard of before In
the history of cotton. Farmers and the whole
South must stand together to resist the pres
sure brought upon them by the consumer and
profecslonal operator to depress tha price ot
cotton. II they trill hold out tar twenty days
victory la sure."
Money and Stocks.
The circular of J. 6. Bache A Co., under
4ate cf New York. September 20, eayi:
"Toe course of the marxet during the past
veelc has been surprising, to say tha leatt. If
there was one consideration - more than any
.Â«ther which was felt to be the dominant influ
ence in the situation it was the money market,
tr.i yet the advance In call mosey to 7 per
cent had very little Influence on prices. The
Bank of England discount rate cf 4 per cent '
corresponds trlth similar rates in the fall of
1903, 1902 anfl 1901. ejthougn 3% per cent was
the h'.ghest rate a year aÂ«o. The advance in
money to 7 per cent, although it affested prices
Â«r.!y to a -small extent, curtailed speculation.
The fiasco in Chicago Subway stock, eulminat
lrg Thursday in a net decline of 86 points, ex
ercised a greater influence on prices for a time
than did the higher money rates. Neither In
fluence, however, caused aay large amount of
\u25a0trek to come en the market. Traders gener
ally are bearish, but recognize only too well
tr.at bear ammunition has run very low and
tfcs-t atteaspts to break the market result only
te Ices of stock and an increase in the short
Interest.
'The business situation has If anything
<iÂ»fe49d for the better. The enormous de
xstjAl for rails and railroad equipment is thÂ»>
t>Â«3i< a Â« o* the market ror finished steel, but
there is also a stringency of structural steel
' Â«r.d a heavy fleaiaad exists in lighter grades.
General business is in excellent condition, the
banking position is entirely sound, and the
enormous crops will be reflected soon In greater
activity la Industrial and commercial lines.
Coupled with theee conditions there is a large
And increasing gold output forming a basis for
Increasing credits. Railroad rate legislation
tr.d higher money rates eeem about the only
clou<lb on the speculative horizon.
"Cor per chares are coming in for a larger
â¢part of market Interest, awakened by the In
crease In tha Anaconda dividend rate. The
xaets.l is etrong euid in larsre demand.
â¢The period of stiff money will probably not
laet over a few days, and, Judging by the ac

K>w Tork Stock Market.
. NEW TORK, Oct. 4.â The market for stocks
remained In professional hands to-< Jay. Vlgor
ojs efforts were m&de during the early part of
the day to extend the rewvery which eet in
late yesterday, but the efforts proved unavail
ing and the course cf prices turned downward.
A recovery in the call money rate accompanies
thÂ«. decline and may have had a part in in
6-^'-' â¢-\u25a0 the selling, but tne pressure was not
iej|.^ and "its movement eui&ested more the
professionalism of operations as the cause for
its limitation. No -special operations in the
money market were known to account for the
renewed flurry, which reached 7% per cent,
the highest rate for the year. The feeling has
\u25a0 persisted throughout the week, however, that
the real conditions in the money market were
concealed by last Saturday's bank statement
end that the easier condition* which were de
veloping were partly fictitious. A suspicion on
this subject was much aggravated' by the
knowledge of the remarics made at the annual
. meeting of the Clearing-house yesterday by
tha president of one of the larger banks in
that association. While no official record was
made of those remarks. It was known that the
sense of . them was an emphatic denunciation
cf the weekly bank etatement as an unrelia
ble showing of the condition of the banks and
t warning of the danger of the course of the
trust companies In the extension of loans with
out rufflciect cash reserves. This Is no new
eubject In Wall street, but present conditions
Ctve it renewed force.. It Is over two years
elnce the Clearing-house authorities inaugu
rates attempts to enforce the increase in the
cash reserves to be held by the trust com
panies. The necessity for such provieicn was
erg-Jed from the large proportion of trust cora
paxy deposits payable en demand and said to
be at the time at least 85 per cent of the total
deposits. It was argued that the exemption
of the trust companies from the reserve re
culrernent cf the Clearing-house threw an un
Â«ue burden on ' the Clearing-house Bank re
serves in the time of strain. At that time it
tru attempted to force a minimum reeerve re
quirement, of 10 per cÂ«nt of deposits on the
trust companies, I to be raised to a maximum
of 15 per cent in the discretion of the Clear
ing-house committee. Most of the â¢ trust com
panies thereupon withdrew from clearing privi
leges. There is a dleposltion to attribute the
unexplained Increase In cash reserve lazt week
to -the credit of the Rockefeller checks in con
tA'.tca with the f 10,000.000 gift to the educa
tiw-al fund. Some effect was produced by the
report abroad that the proposed Russian loan
may reach $360,000,000. Foreign discount con
tinueC to advance and foreign exchange rates
fcere were firmly hell.. Tne money market is
faring better at the hands of the Sub- Treasury
this week than last, owing to the payments of
the October Government interest.
The period of drain on bank reserves, how
ever, has not yet shown its limit. To-day's
early market offered an extraordinary variety
of unexplained advances In industrial special
ties. A rood many were lost in the last re
action. The railroad stocks at no time showed
any notable' strength and the selling of the
afternoon made considerable Inroads on their
prices. TTie market closed eaey.
Bonds were easy. Total sales, par value,
$3,630,000.
United States 2a coupon declined % per cent

ENDS HIS LIFE
WITH A BULLET
Alexandra Corbin, Ladies'
Hairdresser, Commits Sui
cide in His Room
Alexanflre Corbln, ladies' hairdresser
at JtS Geary street, committed suicide
In his room at the Hotel Rochambtau
yesrÂ«-rday morning by putting a bullet
through hi* brain. Albert Jordan, who
occupies an adjoining room, heard the
report cf a pistol shot as he was leav
ing his room about 9 o'clock. He no
tified Mrs. T. Cazeaux. the landlady,
and an investigation "was made. Cor
bln's room was opened with a pass key
and he was found dead in bed.
Grasped in his right hand was a re
volver. A bullet hole near the temple
told the tale. The Coroner was at
once notified and the body removed to
the Morg-ue.
Corbin had written a brief note in
French to the landlady, in which he
told her he was no grood to himself or
to others and apologizing for the
trouble he would cause her. He asked
her to take possession of the goods and
effects in his store, which might re
compense her for the three months'
board bill he was owing her.
Corbin's huirdrcssing establishment
was patronized by the smart set and he
\u25a0was frequently called to Burlir.grame
by ladies who reside there to dresj
their coiffures. He has been considered
mentally unbalanced for tome time.
Some months ago he attempted to com
mit suicide by jumping from a ferry
tÂ«out while crossing the bay to Oak
land. He was arrested there and ex
amined by ihe Insanity Commissioners
but discharged. About two weeks ago
he fell aslee:> in Goldeir-fJate Park and
when lie awoke lie reported to the Park
police station that he had been robbed
of Jl>. He was v. native of France,
about 35 years of age. and unmarried.
It is not known whether he had any
relatives in this country.

THROWN FROM
A STREET CAR
Mrs. Virgil Nahl Badly Hurt
by Falling From Dummy
of the Geary Street Line
Mrs. Virgil Nahl was thrown from a
Geary-etreet car yesterday and received
injuries to her head which rendered her
unconscious.
The car was outward bound at or near
the corner of Point Lobos and Fifth ave
nues when the accident happened. Mrs.
Nahl was picked up and taken to the
French Hospital, where she was treated
by Dr. Alden. It was several hours before
she regained consciousness. She said she
was on her, way to the hospital to visit
her mother. Mrs. James Powell, and was
sitting on the dummy of the car. .Just
before the car reached Fifth avenue, she
said, she called to the gripman \ and
asked him to stop. She said the car went
around the corner with such force that
it threw her from her seat to the' pave
ment, where she landed on her head with
great force.
That was the last she -knew until she
recovered consciousness at the hospital.
The conductor says, that the car had
not reached the corner when Mrs. Nahl
fell off, but was some distance from it,
and. that hÂ«. is of the opinion she'had a
fainting attack which caused her to lose
her hold on the seat and to be precipi
tated to the sround.
Mr. Nahl. the husband of the injured
woman, discredited the idea that it was
a faintinc attack which caused his wife
to lose her balance and pitch from the
car. He said that she had never had such
a spell and that she was in perfect health.
She had gpent the afternoon, at- a card
party with some lady friends, where she
is reported to have been in the best of
health and spirits.' â¢ ;
Dr. Alden could not state last night the
extent of Mrs. Nahl's injuries. At first
he was afraid her skull_ was fractured,
but when she bTtstrtciied up and was
able to eive an account of the accident
he felt that the trouble was not as seri
ous as he at 'first suspected. .

The San Francises Real Estate Board
yesterday forwarded resolutions to the

He Has Golden Key to

OSCULATION FOEBIDDEN

TV^ose Treatment Goes
Beyond the ; Proprieties
. Professor Riker, divine healer, and
prophet, . whose office is at 1035^ Mar
ket street," was yesterday denied 'en
trance to the] home of Mrs. James Cof
fin, 37 Van Ness avenue, and- told by
the. resolute husband that should he
agraJn attempt to 'cross their threshold
hÂ« would be ejected by force. ;
Professor Riker maintains that Cof
fin is jealous of him because part of
his ceremonies of healing the, sick de
mand that he- kiss his patienL
Coffin, when seen by. a Call reporter
yesterday, told, a remarkable story.
He says that in; some -mysterious man
ner Riker learned that, Mrs. Coffin was
ill and. called , upon her ; during 1 the
husband's absence. -When Coffin
turned home he found . his wife in a
serious condition, and for a . time phe
believed 3he had lost her mind. . She
told him many things about the- .man
who claimed to have "the grolden key
to the kingdom of "\u25a0 health, happiness
and divine . wisdom," and . it became
evident that the ; woman was under
some strange influence. * , . ,
Coffin immediately sent for the fam
ily physician. Dr.. Florence Ward, and
with* some difficulty Mrs. .Coffin :was
restored to 'her mental equipoise. :She'
then explained .* that Professor Riker
had called upon her and had ;gone
through ceremonies which he ; said
would heal her. During-, the ceremonies
Riker put his arms around, her waist
and kissed her.;'. He then, patted her
on the cheeks and back and informed
her that in a few more treatments
she would be all-right.. .
\lt Is said that .while under Riker's
strange influence slip took the bottles
of medicine prescribed by the doctor
and broke them to pieces by throwing
them 'against the chairs.* She ,. then
thought the Riker treatment would
help her more than the drugs, but
since the strange influence. has passed
away she thinks he" is a faker and
says that if she ; had taken another
treatment she would be fit for the
asylum. ' _ . . ' .' .: .
The healer was just making his sec
ond visit to his patient when he was
meton the doorstep by the angry hus
band and-informed .that if he did not
keep away he would find himself a
subject ' for the Morgue. Coffin says
Riker is preying upon sick and help
less' women whom he : is able to. 'get
under his influence. It is his opinion
that the police- should take the , matter
in hand and- have the professor run out
of town.
Professor Riker says he found a
card on his desk asking him to call on
Mrs. Coffin as she was very ill and
the d Y '6tdrs"? could , not cure. her. :He
said' that- he called Uipbn her and did
her a great deal of good and would
have cured her*. had: he been allowed
another visit. â¢ â¢ - . '.
JJI do, not' claim to be - a divine
healer" said Professor Riker. "You
can heal as well as I If "you "only make
a study of it. It is only the povver of
suggestion and is practiced Vy rub
bing your hands -upoii the breast and
back of the person and kissing her on
the forehead." , . . .
â¢ The doctor, says it was the kissing
part of the ceremony that Coffin ob
jected to, and that he; would rather
allow his wife to suffer all kinds of
agonies than to see another man kiss
her even on' the forehead. .
"He has no reason to be jealous of
me," said Riker. "as|l am a" married
man and my busness â¢ demands that I
lead'aeure and, holy, life.,: I have been
fasting for several days, ; and when I
am not f asting >my meals consist .of
bread and " vegetables. I . never eat

The ' home of another wealthy

In ?the footsteps of - William H.

Capitalist Gage directly charges his

statement that he has found a recon
ciliation.. Impossible." The' suit, how
ever. Is not" for dlvorce.but is brought
tofsefaside a trust deed; by which the
lumberman -conveyed .-for \u25a0 his wife's
uses "* property valued at $30,000. He
made this trust deed, he says, In. the
hopes that it would mend his broken
home, his : wife agreeing to return â¢to
him,; but.' he says, the property in her
hands,:, his -.wife broke her word and
he; has awakened to the realization that
he'ls the- victim of: fraud, y
* r.ln â¢ his complaint" Gage says that the
deed of trust he now! seeks to set aside
provided, that =the described
therein should be held in trust by ,W.
V. ;B. Mills for" the ' use of ' the defend
ant. This contract as reads in
part, "as follows: . â¢ ,
.* The said Mills , to hold said property, and
each and every parcel thÂ«reof, -until my death
or \u25a0 until such . prior time as I shall cease . to

vorce from my said wife." should she be divorced
from me. or upon my ~ death, should ' I die

said properties," and .the whole thereof, to my
eald wife, and thereafter -the same shall' be
and become her own separate property and es
