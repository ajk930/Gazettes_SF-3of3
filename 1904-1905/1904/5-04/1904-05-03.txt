All of the hundreds of Methodists
who had spent Sunday In the canyon,
intending to leave Sunday evening,
were detained until near noon to-day,
when the wreck. was cleared' away and
trains began to move. There nevÂ°r
had been so large a crowd in the can

mile of extra sidetracks to accommo
date the many trains.
To-day lots were drawn for spats for
the different delegations and final ar

entire floors, including assembly rooms,
offices, general departments and exhi

have been reserved for a world-wide
missionary exhibit, the biggest show of

country.
WRECK CAUSES DELAY.
As the time diminishes before the
opening session of the 1904 quadrennial
conference its importance grows and
all eyes are secretly turned on the can
didates to the episcopacy. The first
big debate on this, the biggest question
before the conference, will probably re
late to the number of new bishops to
be elected. The present episcopacy, it
is rumored, has taken the most con
servative stand it could and will recom
mend the election of but three bishops.
The laity and many prominent divines
representing varied interests of the
church, both home and foreigm, are
said to be coming to the conference
with a fixed determination to set forth
the necessity for and then demand the
election of at least eight bishops. While
the episcopacy has not a vote it is un
derstood it will exert all its power to
counteract this laity movement.
The Methodist Conference excursion
ists had twenty-four hours longer at
the Grand Canyon of the Colorado than
scheduled owing to a wreck of the reg
ular canyon train 'that blocked the
line in front of the excursionists. The
wreck occurred at Valla, Ariz., thirty
miles west of Williams.

WASHINGTON, May 2.â Miss Edith
Sutherland, eldest daughter of â the late
Surgeon General/Charles Sutherland
of "ttaV United StfJfes areiy.-died here
last" slight at hcv homo from"' the. effecta
of laudanum poisoning." She took the
dose secretly and passed away quietly
while she lay on a couch and. was be
ing read to by her aged mother. The
latter, not noticing that her. daughter
had fallen asleep, continued" to read
from 3 o'clock in the afternoon until
about C o'clock in ' the evening, when
she spoke and received no reply. Going
to ' the couch Mrs. Sutherland shook
her daughter, and, receiving no reply,
felt her pulse, which was scarcely per
ceptible. Mrs. Sutherland became
alarmed and succeeded in partly
arousing Miss Edith.
"Wake, up, Edith," called Mrs.
Sutherland, who surmised that the girl
had taken laudanum, as she had done
on previous occasions. "You know
how bad you will feel to-morrow from
this."
The dying girl half opened her eyes
and murmured:
"There will be no to-morrow - this
time, mother." .
Then she closed her eyes again.
Dr. Sutherland, the dead girl's
father, some years ago was stationed
at the Presidio in San Francisco and,
on assuming charge of the medical
department of the Pacific division of
the army, was in affluent circum
stances. While stationed there the
general became acquainted with some
of the numerous mining schemers who
swarmed In the Golden . Gate city,
with the result that he lost nearly all
of his money. Through the. influence
of friends and after her father's death
Miss Sutherland obtained a clerkship
in the pension office, where she applied
herself to her duties so assiduously to
obtain a promotion and so be better
enabled to give her young sisters and
brothers an education that her health
failed and she became for a long time
a nervous wreck. She was finally
obliged to .resign her position and
make a prolonged stay in a sanitarium
near Baltimore.

TOKIO, May 3.â General Kuroki's army is now in control of the entire Manchurian side of the Yalu, and a division that has been thrown across some distance
to the north of the scene of Sunday's fighting is now pushing forward in an attempt to cut off the retreating Russians before they can reach the main position at
Fengwangcheng. Should the Russians be intercepted they would be in danger of annihilation. In Sunday's fighting the Japanese forces carried seven successive lines
of entrenchments, the fighting in some instances being hand-to-hand. Some of the captured Russian guns were taken in a bayonet charge.

says that the impenetrable fog twice
forced the abandonment of the at
tack on Vladivostok, and twice spared
the Russian squadron. a sea fight.
While Kamimura' was steaming
northward the first time he passed
the Russian squadron bound south on
the raid to Gensan. which resulted in
the sinking of the Japanese merchant

TIENTSIN. May 2.â Two hundred
Russians are intrenching themselves

ers. Sinmintung is twd miles from
Koupangtse, a permanent Russian
camp. A detachment of 180 men is
patrolling the railroad lines.
Intrenching on Liao River.
Impossible and famine . appears inev
itable.
"With this dreadful accompaniment
of war there is onlv too likely to be
a rising among the Manchurians. They
may attack, the Russians or they may
attack us. Either case is bad enough
to contemplate.
"To help us sit down and await } all
these contingencies we are working
day and night on the Korean railway,
and bv October the unfinished portions
of the road between Fusan and Seoul
will be completed and a new line from
Seoul to Wiju will be ready. -Locomo
tives are coming from the United
States and as soon as these arrive we
will have a strons and rapid line of
communication through all, Kore3,
which will almost touch our mainland,
and we will not be likely to suffer
from want of â¢ supplies or reinforce
ments.
"As regards Port Arthur and Vladi
vostok the situation is somewhat dif
ferent. I cannot say anything about
the movements of our other armies
that have been mobilized, but there is
no. doubt that the Liaotung peninsula
will be cut oft from supplies if any
success attends our land forces.
Neither Port Arthur nor Vladivostok
can be taken from the sea front, but
I think you will find Port Arthur
either taken bv our land forces . or
starved out by September. The Chinese
are smuggling provisions into Port Ar
thur now from Chef u, but only to an
immaterial extent and that will soon
cease.
"Vice Admiral Togo doubtless will
remain on watch outside Port Arthur.
By September, when the hurricane
season comes, he should be able to
safely house his fleet in a Japanese
port. No fleet, Russian or Japanese,
could be particularly effective then.
I scarcely think Russia will send her
Baltic fleet to face our autumn hur
ricanes. If the ships go before then
they will encounter the monsoon
period, which lasts from May to Au
gust, and in which coaling? at sea en
route to Japan would be exceptionally
dangerous, if not impossible, and coal-
Ing at sea is the only way the Baltic
fleet can take a hand in the war."
â¢ Referring to the long period which
elapsed between the declaration of war
and the land fighting,. Minister Hay
ashi said: . ;
"That waiting, which taxed "the-'pa
tience of the world, has been a busy
and exciting time for us." Our* troops
have been continually marching and
working in anticipation of striking the
blow which would initiate the cam
paign in Manchuria.
"I do not think our morale has been
in any .way 'affected by what Is-.so
erroneously described aa a period of
inaction. ' General Kuroki mayt, even
by his own countrymen, be thought to
be rather slow, but .it. Is better to be
sure.
"The most unfortunate . incident of
the : , campaign luptoj date Is Vice Ad
miral Kamimura's misfortune in miss
ing the Vladivostok fleet. , It seems
from here that it was a pity that the
vice . admiral did t not . stay outside of

gins the publication to-day of a new
Socialist weekly, entitled Das Neue
Montagsblatt, wherein he advocates
the revision of the socialist creed so
that it shall be less Idealistic and more
a programme of practical reform.
Herr Bernstein prefaces hi3 editorial
column with the following questions:
"Is It known to the German Gov
ernment that torpedo-boats and de
stroyers for the Russian Government
are being: built at one of the largest
German shipyards? Is It known to
the Government that in order to dis
guise this breach of neutrality the
several parts of the vessels are ex
ported as half-finished manufactures
and put together in LIbau, Russia? Is
it known, finally, that tho building of
these war vessels Is ?o urgent that
work proceeds from 5 a. m. to 9
p. m.?" .

"This year's harvest in Manchuria, I
learn, promises to be bad. : A million
Russians there, in addition to the Army,
must be fed. We' have, or shall have
dosed everv source of food supply ex
cept by the Siberian railroad. Even
with double tracks and no men or
munitions of war to transport, the
problem of feeding the Russian popu
lation and army in Manchuria would
be in itself intensely serious; but with
a sinsle-track road, which Is Russia's
only vital sinew,- it means the almost
view of the large number, of Russian
troops opposed to us. Its significance
must largely depend on our ability to
pursue the enemy." , . "WV : ''
Reviewing the whole future of the
struggle that has just' commenced ia
such deadly earnest on land Baron
Haj-ashi said:
"The duration of the war must lie
rather with Russia than with Japan.
For the moment the military advantage
is with us, for Kuropatkin has extend
ed his front and. we can strike where
and when we will. Our aggressive
movement may be carried on to Muk
den, perhaps to Harbin and perhaps
even further; but before long there
must come a stage of the campaign
where Russia will assume the role cf
Invading power and where we must
act solely on the defense. From the
beginning' it has been so ( and our ag
gression is and has been but a meaus
toward the eventual repulsion of an
invading army.
"General Kuroki himself probably
cannot say at this moment at exactly
what point our aggression will be
changed into â¢ the defensive. Kuropat
kin, so I believe, says he will not un
dertake to drive us back until he haa
300,000 men ready to take the field. I
think what that means Is that at least
5 ner cent of that force will die from
sickness, so that to keep his force at
the maximum required Kuropatkin will
always have to be transporting 15,00-)

..LONDON. May 2.â Baron Hayashi.

i,i the result of the first serious fight

The announcement that the Russians

As an indication of General Kuropat
kin's anxiety regarding the where
abouts of Japan's second army, the
Morning Post's Shanghai correspondent
lays that all the Russian trops sta
tioned in Chanchu, Fuchau, Haicheng.
Kaiping- and other v places have been
dispatched along the seacoast to watch
for a Japanese landing.
According to the Shanhaikwan corre
spondent of the Daily Telegraph, evi
dence Is accruing that China's neutral

Kirin and Fengtien, the correspondent
Few further details have yet been
received, but it seems that the Jap
anese Imperial Guards fought with
conspicuous bravery and sustained the
brunt of the fighting, losing heavily.
Some accounts speak of bayonet
charges. Â¦
It is evident that the Japanese suc
cess Is largely due to the superiority of
their artillery, the Russians' guns being
too light.
The Japanese victory has caused
complete surprise in the European capi
tals and is expected to lead to difficulty
in Russia's efforts to raise a loan.
The Standard's Tientsin correspond
ent, cabling under date of May 2, says
that Viceroy Alexieff has sent a lengthy
dispatch to General Ma, commanding
the Chinese troops, informing him that
the occasion may arise for Russia to
>Â»crease her forces in Sinmintung,
'Chengyang: and other places, and re
questing him to withdraw the Chinese
military and police. An answer, the
correspondent says. Is -required within
three days.
LONDON, May 3. â The latest dis
patches received here confirming the
completeness of the Japanese victory
on the Yalu River could hardly have
given greater satisfaction in Tokio
than in London. The editorials in the
morning papers ring with admiration
at the success of General Kuroki's
strategy, in a manner indicating that
Great Britain had been in considerable
doubt of the capacity of her ally's
troops when matched against the Rus
sians. Despite Japan's lack of good
cavalry with which to follow up the
victory, it is believed that she will
speedily drive .the Russians out" of
Fehgwarigcheng also*. Â¦ Â»
A special dispatch from Port Arthur
says that about 100 Chinese junks were
observed on the horizon yesterday be
tween the mouth of the Yalu and Liao
tuns peninsula. ,"->"
says, are urging , the Peking Govern
ment to adopt a strong policy against
Russian aggression west of the Liao
River. It is alleged that Viceroy YuaJi
Shai Ka4 is secretly making war prepa
rations, and everything, in the opinion
of the correspondent, points toward
China making a military demonstra
tion against either belligerent fighting
west of the Liao River.
Japanese Imperial Guards Sustain
the Brunt of the Battle and
Lose Heavily.
Â« At the army headquarters here there
is not the slightest evidence that the
Russians consider they have sustained
a reverse. The crossing of the Yalu
by the enemy was taken as a matter or
course and as part of the programme.
The losses are regarded as pawns In
the real game which is to follow.
It is the subject of general remark
here that the Japanese, on crossing the
Yalu adopted almost identically the
tactics thev followed during the Chi
nese-Japanese war, forcing the passage
at the exact place they did in 1835.
The EmDeror is now receiving the
war news at Tsarkoe-Selo (fifteen
miles south of St. Petersburg) a spe

The Dowager Empress and Grand
Duke Michael, the heir presumptive,

Peterhof on the gulf, at the end of

from the mouth of the Yalu River, anC
other places along the coast as far as
Takushan, under the protection' of the
warships. These troops can be kept
in touch with General Kuroki's left
wing. It might also be easier to get-up
a portion of the guns from places
down the coast than to drag them all
up the mountains toward Toitln Pass
from the Yalu. The Japanese are ex
pected to try to turn the Russian po
sition at FengTCangcheng. /
Th.e Russians made a special effort to
hold as long as possible the heights of
Kosan, on an island opposite Kulien
cheng, whence their guns commanded
a considerable stretch of 'the river to
the south, but a Japanese battery on a
hill above Wiju dominated the position,
which the Russians eventually were
forced to relinquish, thus losing the key
to the river.
The desperate character of the strug
gle, there may have been due to the
necessity for gaining time for the with
drawal of the Russian detachments
above and below. General Sassulitch
was in comand of the entire force on
the Yalu, which extended over a dis
tance of _thlrty miles, with reserve sup
ports fifteen miles back. The whole,
according to the best information ob
tainable, did not exceed 17,000 men.
What was the actual force engaged is
not known at present, though probably
it Was not more than 5000 men, if It was
that large. ''
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 2.â ThÂ«
press was. informed at 2:30o'clock this
afternoon that, beyond the fact of the
retreat of the Russians before the
overwhelming superiority of the Japan,
ese on the Yalu River, no details have
been received since the report of Gen
eral Sassulitch, commander of the Sec
ond Siberian Army corps, yesterday,
of the retirement from Kuliencheng.* It
is quite possible that the losses on both
sides in the week's fighting may reach

Bishop- Moore's opinion of Japanese
military ability is entitled to respect.
The Bishop's proudest possession is the
red, white and blue button of the Loyal
Legion, which looms up in somewhat
startling relief -on his somber clericals.
He was a pastor of a church -when the
civil war beean and without hesita-r
tion stepped from the pulpit into the
ranks. He enlisted in the Eighty
seventh Ohio and soon gained a com
mission and promotion to the rank of
captain. He was later made a lieuten
ant colonel of the One Hundred. and
Twenty-fifth Ohio and stayed with the
sword until the war ended, when he
returned to his church. He is a man
of peace now, with a keen and edu
cated appetite for a good fight.
Bishop Moore is an American and a
fighter. He favors Japan in her pres
ent trouble and believes that China
would like to assist the Mikado in
whipping the bear.
"I have the greatest respect for Rus
sia, but as a land-grabber she is to be
feared in the Orient. I hope Japan
whips her to a standstill and think she
will doit." -^ i v'-r; V^; .i v
Bishop Moore, who is accompanied
by his wife, has beea in the Orient four
years. His. territory included. China.
Japan and Korea, with 'headquarters
at Shanghai. The Bishop has come
home to attend the conference of his
church at Los Angeles, but' does not
expect to return to the Far East.
During the voyage across the Pacific
Bishop Moore told the story of _-hi8:
Chemulpo experiences to the China's
passengers In the form of a lecture.
"The explosion occurred according to
schedule and I will never forget the
sight. The powder smoke rose in two
dense, black columns. These pillars
of darkness came together as. they
ascended, completely obscuring the sun,
which had been shining brightly in a
cloudless skv. For a moment the
black curtain parted, letting through
the sunlight and bringing out in bold
relief that jagged splash of black, a
more realistic picture of war than ever
grew under the brush of artist. And
when the smoke had cleared away the
maimed and twisted hull of the war
ship showed the ruin wrought by that
awful convulsion."
"We were graciously received on
board and hospitably entertained. Gen
eral Allen, however, was the only one
able to take part in the conversation.
He told me as we Mrtrfe leaving that it
had been decided to blow up the vessel
at 4 o'clock that afternoon. It was
startling enough information, but,
strange to say, it slipped from my mind
and I did not remember it again until
that afternoon. We were' on the bay
and almost alongside the Koreitz. Sud
denly I remembered. My watch, told
me that it was 3;40. o'clock, and you
may be sure I impressed upon my boat
man the necessity for a speedy retreat.
I was landed on the lighthouse {stand,
about 800 yards from where the Koreitz
was anchored." '; i . :
Bishop Moore arrived at Chemulpo,
on the transport Soongari, which also
was sunk later in the harbor. In com
pany with General Allen, chief of the,
Philippine constabulary and now in Ja-i
pan as one of Uncle Sam's military ob
servers of the war, Bishop Moore vis
ited the Russian war vessel.

Episcopal church, who arrived here
yesterday a passenger on the liner

At Hamatan, where the" Iho River
makes its first bend to the west, the
Japanese succeeded in enveloping th^Â»
Russians on three sides. At this pfacc,
after sharp fighting at close range, the
Japanese captured twenty Russian
guns, with their horses, carriages and
ammunition and more than twenty
officers and many men. The Russian
i troops at Hamatan retreated toward

Prefer Death to Hard Labor.
HONOLULU, April 26. â Lee Jim
and two other Chinese convicted of
robbery in the first degree were sen
tenced to fifteen years at hard labor
by Judge de Bolt last Thursday. Two
of the defendants asked the court to
sentence them to death instead. They
are members of a gang which has been
guilty of numerous hold-ups and rob
beries. Several others have been ar
rested since and have confessed.
"For the present," remarked Mrs.
Stanford. "I would prefer that the
student body would not increase. Dr.
Jordan agrees with me in the theory
that it would be better if it did not in
crease materially In the next ten years,
for we think that better results can be
accomplished with the present number
of students. The idea of new dormi
tories is to keep the students as closely
as possible on the university grounds,
which tends to elevate the standard of
university pride."
After a few days* rest she will go to :
the Stanford University, where she ex- '
pecfc to remain for several months. !
watching the progress of the work of i
construction on the new library build- i
ing, the foundations of which will soon i
be laid. During her visit in Egypt, :
which extended over a period of eight j
weeks, Mrs. Stanford secured a valu- ;
able collection of ancient relics, which j
will be added to the museum at the
university. Just before her departure ,
from that country these relics, which
she brought back with her, were un- j
earthed in the village of Gizeh, where !
the famous group of pyramids are be- '
ing explored by a party und^r the dl- 1
rection of the sheik of Gizeh. ;
In the co-llection is a portrait statue |
of Cheops. It is a seated figure of flint i
stone, four feet high, clearly showing
the anatomy of ihe body, the muscles .
and veins of which are as distinct as '.
those on a well developed human being. '
It is estimated by the Egyptian au- ;
thorities. whose permission was given |
to Mr*. Stanford to bring the relics to
California, that the statue was made :
7000 years before Christ. -A beautiful
necklace of gold beads, connected to
gether with artistic filigree, taken from
the neck of the body of the Queen of
the King of Deshur, which is located
on the western side of the Nile and
south of the pyramids, was also ob
tained by Mrs. Stanford. Egyptolo
gists estimate that the Queen lived
133G years before Christ. Many other
valuable articles, including several
alabaster figures, were obtained in the
same locality, and will greatly enhance
the attractiveness of the university
museum. This collection, together with
the several others gathered by Mrs.
Stanford in Ceylon, New Zealand. Pago
Pago and India, have a value far in
excess of $100,000.
Concerning the future of Stanford
University, Mrs. Stanford said last
evening that she hoped that her life
would !>e spared to see the completion"
of the new library building, which is ;
the last of the big structures included
in the original plans of the university.
Possibly, the added, four or five years
hence may witness the construction of,
additional dormitories, for It is be
lieved that the Increasing attendance
at the university will ultimately de
mand it.
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford, after an ab
sence of nine months, during which she
visited Australia, Ceylon, India. Egypt
and Japan, arrived home from the
Orient yesterday on the steamship
China, noticeably improved in health
and happy in the thought that she is
again in the midst of her many inter
ests, paramount of which is the devel
opment of the gTeat eeat of learning at
Palo Alto.

The vote this time lacked two of the
fourteen necessary to override the
Mayor's vetoes, owing to the absence
of Sanderson, who had previously
voted for the passage of the bills.
The amended ordinance regulating
the explosion of blasts so as to elim
inate the section granting power to the
Board of Works to assess damages
was passed to print.

stedtâ5.
Absent â Sanderson.
Braunhart predicted that "in less
than one year such an appeal would
be made to the people as to grant re
lief to an outraged public."
The vote on the final passage of the
ordinances, notwithstanding the vetoes
of the Mayor, follows:
Supervisor Lunstedt stated that he
had made personal investigations of
the quarry and found that the condi
tions had been* greatly exaggerated.
Lunstedt said if Gray Brothers did not
keep their promise to oil the roads and
prevent the dust from rising he would
vote to drive the Quarries from the
Fairmount district and further that
he would vote for an ordinance en
tirely prohibiting blasting within the
city limits.
Supervisor Finn said he had been
vilified by the Fairmount residents,
who sought to coerce Supervisors to
change their votes. Finn said that any
Supervisor who would recede from his
attitude would be a coward and that
he (Finn) would again vote to sus
tain the Mayor's vetoes.
Braunhart said the ordinances were
designed to prevent lawlessness on the
part of Gray Brothers, who had cut
down the grades of certain streets by
55 feet and more.
When it was proposed to let the
Fairmount residents -be heard on the
subject Supervisor Boxton objected to
giving them too much time.
"I am getting tired of this matter,"
said Boxton, who had previously voted
to override the Mayor's former vetoes.
"These speeches all tend to a 'roast* on
the Supervisors and may result in
changing my vote."
P. J. Healey accused Gray Brothers
of cutting a water pipe leading to his
house, which charge George Grav de
nied. George Weber charged that the
Grays had not kept their promise to
oil' the roads to prevent the raising of
dust.
William Maguire," representing 3'^
square blocks in the Fairmount dis
trict, said the value of 14 homes in
the vicinity would be largely depre
ciated if the ordinances were not pass
ed. Maguire said it was impossible to
sell lots near by because the banks
have refused to lend money thereon.
CONDITIONS EXAGGERATED.
Supervisor Connor pleaded for the
final passage of the measures in order
that the petition of the Fairmount
district residents for relief from Gray
Brothers' rock crushing plant on
Thirtieth street, near Castro, might be
granted.
Connor referred to the fact that the
previous votes on the Mayor's vetoes
lacked one for the overriding of the
vetoes and he appealed to the five
Supervisors that had sustained the
Mayor to change their votes.
Brandenstein made an earnest plea
for the saving of the homes of the
people in the Fairmount district. Ad
dressing the five supporters of the
Mayor, Brandenstein said they had no
right to set their Judgment above thai
of the people that had put them in
office.
BOXTON GETS TIRED.
The Mayor's vetoes of the two ordi
nances extending the limits within
which it is prohibited to carry on rock
crushing and quarrying operations
were again sustained yesterday by the
Board of Supervisors.
The ordinances are identical with
those previously vetoed by the Mayor,
the original vetoes having been sus
tained by five Supervisors, It requiring
fourteen votes to overrule the disap
proval.

"The men on the coast lines, num
bering over one-third of this class of
labor employed by the Santa Fe, struck
a week ago and their places have been
filled. The shops of the company were
not opened to-day because we had re
ceived information from three Inde
pendent sources to the effect that a
strike had been ordered to occur thi"
morning. When they are reopened, as
they probably will be to-morrow morn
ing, the magnitude of the strike can
be definitely ascertained. Within a
\veek or ten. days the company will have
a full force in all shops.
"The number of men directly con
trolled by the Machinists' Union is not
large and the labor market is in such
ccndltion just now as to make it per
fectly practicable to obtain plenty of
skilled labor, in any department."
CHICAGO. May 2.â Third Vice Pres
ident Kendr!ck of the Santa Fe sys
tem issued the following statement to
night relative to the- machinists* strike
which was declared on the Santa Fe
to-day:
"In view of the exaggerated state
ments that have been made regarding
the probable magnitude of the strike on
the Santa Fe system that has come
about by order of the executive officers
of the International Â¦ Association of
Machinists, it seems proper for me to
say that the full force of machinists,
machinists' helpers and machinists' ap
prentices, including non-union men,
employed January 1 of this year on
the entire system was only 2275.
"We will not tolerate it. Other roads
must keep their hands off in this
strike. The' challenge has been thrown
down by the company defying us to a
test of strength. - We' have done
everything possible to avoid Â¦ trouble.
The company hus been hiring men all
along the line and over the country
and herding them in camps along the
line, slipping them into the shops and
letting our men go. iris a question of
self-preservation.
"The men have been given strict
warning against violence. Any mem
ber who enters into an encounter with
a man put into his place does so with
out the advice or instruction of head
quarters and makes himself liable to
suspension and expulsion. We propose
to carry on the strike within the law."
STATEMENT OF COMPANY.
O'Connell said to-night that the
men were prepared to continue the
strike indefinitely: that they were
only asking the same working agree
ment now- in operation on other rail
roads and a discontinuance of the
spotter and detective system, which,
he said, is carried on by the. company
to a shameless degree.
"The system," he said, "is honey
combed with detectives and the men
are watched the moment they leave
the shops and marked, blacklisted
and discriminated against if they pro
test their right to do as they please.
MEN MAKE DEMANDS.
WASHINGTON, Mav 2.â Over 800
machinists and a large number of al
lied workers on the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa -Fe Railroad were reported
out on a strike up to D o'clock this af
ternoon. When the ; whole striking
strength is brought out, embracing not
only the machinists, but allied metal
mechanics, boilermakers, blacksmiths,
copperworkers. helpers, etc, as N .well,
the total number â. involved, according
to President O'Connell of the Machin
ists' Union, may approximate between
10,000 and 12,000 men. The strike was
ordered on instructions from head
quarters here after the men along the
line had voted unanimously in favor
of the step. .A telegram to-day from
John Mulholland of Toledo, president
of the National Allied Metal Mechan
ics, announced that he had ordered his
men to go out with the machinists,
which means a sympathetic strike
from that quarter embracing probably
1000 men engaged in semi-skilled labor
in the Santa Fe shops. O'Connell says
that the machinists are out all along
the Santa Fe lines, 800 of them being
now specifically reported out. The Al
lied Metal Mechanics, the boilermak
ers, etc.,, in practically all of the shops
west of Albuquerque, are also reportec
out.
Among other troubles are those
caused by theÂ« demand of 400 car
penters in Springfield and Chicopee
for an increase of 50 cents a day.
There were minor strikes in the build
ing trades, in other places, but in New
England as a whole the number of
men in voluntary idleness is smaller
this year than usual.
BOSTON, May 2. â The principal
difficulty to occur on May day in New
England was the strike of more than
1500 bakers in this city and near by
places,' including Cambridge, Lynn,
Salem, Brodktbri, J Abington. Rockland,
Stoughton, Northeaston, Weymouth,
South WeymQuth and . Bridgewater.
The strike was caused by the refusal
of the rnaster bakers to sign a new
schedule calling for a sixty-hour week
and $16 weekly for second hands and
518 for foremen. The larger hotels
and â¢ restaurants are not affected by
the strike.

This charge was again denied vigor

entire' morning in trying to show that
Waiver K. Slack, the land attorney, who
v.asÂ»JIyde's clerk for several years end
ing in the autumn of 1902, and was
.later employed by him in various mat
ters, had all the secret information re
â¢ gardlng. Hyde's transactions and of the
* HCnry P. Dimond. one of the defend
4ntS in the land frauds case, inadvert
ently added another link yesterday to
' the" chain of evidence^ which, according
to the Government, connects him with
"the authorship of the anonymous let
â¢te-rs that are now the battle-ground in
â¢ Jhe hearing before United States Com
missioner Heacock. He was called on
to produce several more specimens of
liis j*pii printing and script writing, and
In* the course of this work the word
"dummies" was misspelled "dummys."
The .same error occurs twice in the
anor^ymous letter that was mailed from
"San Francisco on December 22 last to
Secretary Hitchcock of the Interior
Department. â¢
While on the stand a week ago Dl
tnond "wrote from the dictation of his
â¢ attorney, Samuel Knight, a number of
ecntences selected from the same
anonymous letter. The aim was to
ehow that his penmanship was totally
j unlike that of the Secretary's unknown
correspondent, who signed himself
â¢'Truth." In "Truth's" letter, however,
o the word "owns" was misspelled
"ownes." Dimond in writing out this
sentence as Knight read it off to him
made the same mistake. Even before
attempting any exemplars of his pen
manship Dimond. in his oral testimony,
had committed a series of other errors
Identical with mistakes found in one or
anoth.er of the anonymous letters.
These different slips, in addition to the
secret information set forth in the let
ters â which information Federal Coun
sel Heney has sought to show was in
DITnond's possession â constitute the
basis of the Government's charge that
IMmond wrote the Utters In order to
eet the department detectives upon his
former client, Fred A. Hyde, and to
establish a defense for himself In the
event of *Hyde's prosecution.
.SLACK IS NOW SUSPECTED.
McEnerney, of Hyde's counsel, and
Heney, for the Government, both ob
jected, but Wheeler said: "Before the
day is done your Honor may have a
pretty good idea of who wrote
the anonymous letters."
"Just to show, you* that you are
wrong," said Heney. "we'll let the bars
down and withdraw our objection "
Then the witness answered that he
did not know why he* was ordered to
"Did you know you were summoned
to Washington in the land frauds in
vestigation?" asked Wheeler.
Slack was questioned closely as to
his connection with the Government
investigation. He told of his interview
with Detective Burns In October, 1903.
At Burns' request he had written
Schneider*to let no consideration for
him stand in the way of a full dis
closure of Hyde's office methods. This
letter had been written with the ap
proval of the writer's personal. friend
and attorney, Leon Samuels. Samuels
is another of the*sraduates from
Hyde's office, having served succes
sively as the land speculator's office
boy, clerk and attorney. He resigned
the last position to Dimond when the
latter took over Hyde's land fases in
the summer of 1901." On December
19, 1803, the day on^which the news
of Benson's Arrest at Washington was
published in the San Francisco papers,
Samuels had been informed by United
States District Attorney Woodworth
that Slack was wanted in Washington,
and on Samuels' advice the witness
gaid he started East the next even
ing.
HE DENIES THE LETTERS.
Government investigation of the same
that was possessed by the anonymous
letter writer. Slack had already testi
fied as to his trip at Hyde's request to
Tucson, where he interviewed Joost H.
Schneider, also one of Hyde's former
clerks, and tried to learn what he had
told the Government agents who were
investigating Hyde and Benson's land
deals. Wheeler called him back to the
stand yesterday and made him tell all
about his trip to Washington in De
cember last, when Slack accepted an
invitation from the Government to visit
the capital and disclose to the Grand
Jury what he knew about the same
jnen and their operations In State and
Federal lands.
T\VO WITNESSES IN LAND FRAUDS CASE WHO ARE CHARGKD BT ATTOR
NEY WHEELER WITH KNOWLEDGE OF AUTHORSHIP OF ANONYMOUS
fcETTERS; ALSO FEDERAL COMMISSIONER CONDUCTING HEARING.
EVERETT, Wash., May 2.-A. II.
Finney, a dry goods merchant, was ar
rested to-day on the charge of setting
hi3 store on fire this morning. The
forty guests lodged at the Hotel Vir
ginia, which Is located on the second
floor of the building, were forced to
leave their rooms with scant clothing.
The occupants of the hotel were
aroused by two slight explosions, fol
lowed by two heavier detonations,
which shook the building. These pre
ceded the breaking out of the flames,
giving those in the. house time to es
cape. The ' firemen found a quantife
of oil soaked rags and waste und?r
Flnney's store, which had been placed
there through a hole cut in the floor.
It is alleged that Finney's stock waa
over-insured.
Finney stated to-day that he is un
able to account for the placing of the
inflammable material where it was
found. He admits that the evidence
against him is strong, but protests that
he is innocent. Until his preliminary
examination Wednesday Finney was
released on $2500 bonds.
"I advised Slack," Samuels said, "to
tell the Government all he knew and
not to try to shield Schneider or Hyde.
I said it was not right for Schneider to
account for hirf silence by saying that
he was trying to protect Slack. Slack
did not inform' j me - of his visit to
Schneider at Tucson. I should have
advised him against going."
The noon hour having arrived Heney
indicated his suspicion of Wheeftfr's
aim by saying to Samuels just before
he left the stand: "Mr. Samuels, don't
talk to any Government representatives
during the recess. We. do not care how
much you talk with the defense. Mr.
Wheeler "believes- you mailed the Town
Talk letter at San Jose on August 1,
and hence I do not want him to think
that you have had any communication
with the Government before he can
examine you on that subject."
This brought Samuels to his feet in
a frenzy of rage.
"Any assertion that I mailed such
letter or had anything to do with any
anonymous letter is an Infamous false
hood." he shouted, waving his arms
in the air. ..V,,;;;
After luncheon, however, Samuels
was not -recalled, the whole of the
afternoon session being spent in obtain
ing samples of Dimond's writing. The
defendant was called to the stand this
time by Heney, whose cross-examina
tion had not been completed when Di
mond testified before. A large num
ber of. sentences were dictated to him
and he wrote them with great care. It
came out that Dimond has the unusual
habit of using his right hand for writ
ing with a pen and the left for penc'.l
work, as well as for signing his name
with pen or pencil. Heney, however,
had him write the selections alternately
with right and left hand and with pen
and pencil. The results of the defend
ant's work were turned over to the
commissioner to have them photo
graphed for use of counsel. Heney
claims that the witness did not benefit
himself by his \ afternoon's writing.
The errors in the spelling of. the 'words
"dwns" and "dummies" will be used
in further cross-examination, when.DI
mon* is recalled to the stand later In
the week. .
The hearing will "continue this morn
ing,'when Hyde may take the stand for
a few questions his counsel. Com
missioner Heacock Is pressing the at
torneys to conclude the case this week.
Samuels declared he did "not learn
from Woodworth why Slack was want
ed in Washington. He did not com
municate the. fact of Slack's departure
to Hyde untn the former's arrival in
Washington had become known there.
.SAMUELS BECO3IES EXCITED..
Leon Samuels was then called by
Wheeler. He related the story of his
rise to* a position of truest in Hyde's
office and his leaving to begin practice
for himself. It came out that he had
ben a* law school classmate of Dis
trict Attorney Woodworth, but he said
their relations were not intimate.
Wheeler tried to get him to admit that
he held resentment against Hyde be
cause the latter reproached him with
regligence in allowing a default judg
ment for $8000 to be entered against
him, but Samuels protested that he
entertained the warmest friendship for
his former employer. He had recently
acted as Hyde's attorney in several
matters.
Washington and that he had not seen
or communicated with Hyde before
starting on his sudden journey. He
knew nothing of Benson's alleged
bribery of Harlan and Valk, the land
office examiners, and had not met
Judge Pugh and Agent Steece of the
Interior Department when they were
in San Francisco. He had never met
Mrs. Belle Curtis after she left Hyde's
office and had never heard Miss Susan
Dickinson, another of Hyde's sten
ographers, called "Anne." The wit
ness told of his bookkeeping while h\
was 'with Hyde and said that one-half
the salary paid to Dimond ,by Hyde
was charged to Benson. Finally Slack
denied he had visited San Jose on
August 4 last, the day on which the
Town Talk letter Was mailed there,
and emphatically declared that he had
absolutely no knowledge as to who
wrote any of the anonymous epistles.
More than a year ago Attorney Gen
eral Knox recommended to the Presi
dent that Griggsby be dismissed for
disobedience "of the orders of the de
partment in leaving his post without
permission. Subsequently charges
were preferred against him, in' which
It was alleged that he received $10,000
from the Pioneer Mining Company of
Nome, the allegation stating that the
sum was to secure for the Pioneer
Mining Company immunity from
United States prosecution. Griggsby
admitted the receipt of the money,
half of which was in cash and the
other half in stock in the Pioneer
Mining Company, but said it was an
attorney's fee.

The work of impaneling a jury to
try Leon Soeder for murder was begun
yesterday morning before Judge Cook,
and when court adjourned at 4 o'clock
seven Jurors had been chosen.. Their
names are.:' James Mearns, 1828 Page
street; Wiliam Kaiser, 2128 Post street;
Daniel S. Davis. 2423 Sutter street;
George H." Wellbrock, ' 909 Fillmore
street; John D. Heise. 552 Valencia
street; Roswell Lee, 11191& Hyde street,
and Francis W. Steitz, 2963 Pine street.
When the case was called the names
of the 250 talesmen drawn from the
Cbunty Clerk's box were read and most
of them answered. The Judge addresst
ed them and said that any Juror who
would act in this case would be ex
cused for one year and would receive
a certificate tc- that effect. Those who
should be tailed upon to act in four
other cases to be tried before him be
fore vacation would be excused till
after vacation, as none of the cases
would take up much time. He would
excuse those summoned o-n statutory
grounds only. The talesmen were call
ed ten at ,a time and stated their ex
cuses to the Judge. Very few had a
statutory excuse.

fense nine. District Attorney Bying

defendant is represented by General E.

Soeder had the same cynical expres
sic-n on his face that was characteristic
of him during the preliminary hearing
before Police Judge Cabanlss. He is
accused of fatally stabbing his brother
in-law, Joseph Blaise, at Vallejo and
Taylor streets, on Sunday night, Janu
ary 10, Blaise's dead body having been
discovered the next morning. The mo
tive alleged by the prosecution was that
Soeder wanted to secure the insurance
money on the life of Blaise, who had
been brought from his home in Ger
many by Soeder., * y
Taking of Testimony Will
Be Probably Started at
This Afternoon's Session
The California bill that attracted the
most attention here. was that providing
for the diversion of the Colorado River
for Irrigation purposes â a bill intended
to confirm the rights of the California
Development Company in the work al
ready done and to be done. Parties
interested for and against it have been
here all winter and it has taken a great
dear of the time of the Committee on
Irrigation of Arid Lands. Those favor
ing the bill were finally compelled to
be content with a" commission to In
vestigate and report upon all the in
teresting questions involved. .
The bill providing for a California
camp site enlisted the best efforts of
the entire Republican delegation. It
would doubtless have succeeded but for
the conflicting reports as to the de
sirability of the several sites. The ef
fort in its behalf was sustained to the
very last, Senator Perkins in the last
days attaching an amendment to the
military academy appropriation bill in
which all fo-ur sites were named and
choice between them left to the War
Department. But it went out on a
point of order as new legislation.
Other Important bills upon which a
lot of work was done, but which failed
notwithstanding, are the military camp
sites, appropriation for purchase of the
toll roads of Yosemite Park, purchase
of the Calaveras big tree groves, the
five per cent bill and a number of
of less general interest.
COLORADO RIVER BILL.
prevented by the fact that it is within
the park limits, although it contains
nothing of scenic interest. The San
Francisco members j opposed the bill.
I asked Wynn why he did so and he
said .that two or three persons had
written him asking him to do so. He
did not know who his correspondents
were, but felt it to be his duty to ob
ject because they asked him to. He
did not know any one in Mariposa
County to whom he could write and
get at the merits of the bill, and so he
intended to wait until he could visit
the place himself, as he felt that he
did not only represent San Francisco,
but the whole State of California.1
There are over 300 people in the town
ships-in question. They own the land
chiefly mining and timber lands â and,
says Gillett, they wish especially ! to
work the mines.
Mr.' Gillett had a somewhat. similar
experience with a bill ; in which he . was
much interested.'. It was intended ; to
cut out a number. of townships from
the northwest corner 1 of the Yosemite
National Park and attach them to the
Sierra Forest Reserve. The bill was
approved.by- the- Secretary of the In
terior* and, says Mr. Gillett, by. the peo
ple of /Maripbsa County," wh'ose' welfare

This thing of getting unanimous con
sent for the consideration of any par
ticular bill out of its order on the cal
endar in the last days of the session
with a crush of bills pending, the au
thors of every,, one of which consider
them, equally important, is, it will be
seen," no inconsiderable trick. To have
cleared the way, therefore, for a pet
measure and to have onOs own confrere
put in the objection of estopal, as did
Livernash for Bell's Round Valley bill,
must be particularly aggravating.
Livernash and ..Bell fell out early in
the session at the time Bell "proposed
his collier amendment to the naval bill.
Livernash is said 'to have accused Be'l
of simply trying to make political cap
ital out of a well-appearing but impos
sible- project, and from that time on
they ceased to be on speaking .terms.
The success of the collier proposition
did not tend to bring them "closer to
gether, so that when Bell's other im
portant measure came, on^ with a/cor
talnty of passing, Livernash, by the
mere act; of refusing the unanimous
consent, defeated it. Bell waited every
day for an opportunity to call the meas
ure up "during the. hour devoted to that
purpose at a time when , Livernash
should, be, absent,'. but, although, Liver
nash was conspicuous for This absence
during the earlier days of the session;
no such opportunity occurred:. '] Should
Livernash leave the -floor for a moment
it was observed that : Wynn, ' the . other
member from San Francisco," was alert
to put : in .the objection'- for him. The
bill thus defeated was ' intended^ to
throw -open 'to homestead entry some
63,000 acres of land cut from, the Indian
reservation of Round Valley some years
The most important piece of accom
plished legislation so far as California
is directly and especially concerned
is the provision in the naval appro
priation bill, under which the build
ing of ships of war will be inaugurated
at the Mare Island Navy Yard. This
provision was inaugurated by Mr. Bell
when he proposed in the House an
amendment by which two colliers,
which it was proposed to construct
for the navy at a cost of $2,500,000,
should be built in navy yards, one on
the Atlantic and one on the Pacific.
The amendment was not agreed to, but
an amendment to the amendment, by
which one should be built In a navy
yard and one by private contractors
carried. .In this form it went to the
Senate, where Senator Perkins pro
posed again the original amendment
and secured its passage. The Senate
conferees stuck to the point and the
House finally accepted it. And so
shipbuilding will be introduced at
Mare Island.
The bill providing for the Federal
building at Los Angelas has a history
of its own. Because of the great num
ber of such bills and the disposition of
Congress to pass nothing of the kind
at this session it required most diligent
effort on the part of Senator Bard and
Mr. McLachlan. who directly interested
themselves in it. The bill got through
the Senate without much trouble, but
in the House it had to come up out
of order by unanimous consent and :t
could not do this without the consent
of Speaker Cannon. He refused \abso
lutely in spite of the representations of
Bard, McLachlan and the House lead
ers, whom they interested, until finally
the President himself was appealed to
and his interest enlisted to such ex
tent that he called Cannon to an inter
view and the bill passed the next day.
DISCOURTESY TO BELL. \
These things represent, of course,
the labors of the whole delegationâ
not in equal proportion by any means,
but all have had some share in bring
ing them to pass.
IMPORTANT LEGISLATION.
This of course does not include the
salaries of army, navy and civil offi
cials and the incidental expenses of
the conduct of Federal affairs. Nor
does the list of figures give any ade
quate Idea of the effort required to
make it up. Besides these things, and

discovered that her husband was em
ployed as a tailor at; 14 Fourth street

She could not swear that her husband
had married the woman, so a friend,
Mrs. Mary Goldberg, 902 Howard

lice Judge Fritz charging Burg with
failure to provide. If it can be, proved
that he has married the other woman

We all knowâ and proudly proclaim
that San. Francisco has long been the
nursery of Western art, music anoj let
ters. In a motherly sort of way she has
nurtured the budding genii that were
born of her, even becoming a kindlj>
foster mother to those of foreign shores
who loved the artsâ and the social life
they engendered.
But with all the atmosphere of
atelier, studio and library that satur
ates San Francisco, there ia no one
Â¦hallowed home where men and women
of cultural development may meet and
fraternizeâ but perhaps the men are
not lonesome, having their Bohemian
Club, their University Club, their Fam
ily Club, etc., where kindred spirits
meet and travel the Elysian paths of
companionship. And so, too, have the
women their clubs, but it is a com
mingling of clever men and clever wo
men on common ground that brings out
the best and highest In bothâ likewise
the subtlest pleasure. Besides, it might
become a factor in domestic harmony!
Who knows? And thus it is that to
morrow night the Sequoia Club,
brought intb nebulous being by Miss
Ednah Robinson, will meet and. perfect
Its .organization.
The men and women who have been
asked to join are representatives of lo
cal art, literature (such as we have),
music, society and general goodfellow
shlpâa - salon such as obtains in
Gotham. And that Interesting gather
ing of interesting people will take place
in one of the most Interesting homes
in the cityâ in the old Hittell home on
Turk street, that in proportion to Its
size has probably sheltered more
notable people than the Palaceâscien
tists, painters, writers, and all the
craftsmen of the mind.
.That meeting to-morrow night prom
ises much for the development of our
social 'life "along sane and fascinating
lines. Here's success to it â and to its
fair founder! '.

John Mitchell, veteran of the Civil
War, an Indian lighter of note, and for
the last ten years armorer at the Uni
versity of California, died yesterday
afternoon at the United States General
Hospital at the Presidio, succumbing
to an attack of heart disease.
As a private in the United 'State3
at my Armorer Mitchell had an ex
cellent record, having been commended
several times for bravery in action and
having been voted a. medal by Con
gress for faithfulness in the discharge
of duties. The greater part of his
fighting was done in the Indian wars
of the seventies, although his first ex
perience came in the Civil War. Mitch
ell served for several years under Gen
eral Nelson A. Miles and was in close
proximity to General George A. Custer
at the time of the memorable Custer
massacre.
Mayday was celebrated yest-rday In
; glorious fashion by the school children
"at. Golden .Gate Park. From early
r*cr"n until late at night they romped,
frolicked and gamboled over the beau
tiful mossy greens of the playgrounds
"at. their own sweet pleasure. Never
* has the park presented a more beauti
ful appearance. Buds and blossoms
* vith sweet fragrance vied with the
verdure of the tail trees that
6acked the grounds. The maypole
I'dance was naturally the great feature
,of the day. This was supposed to com
mence on the lawn north of the chil
'. dreri's playground building at 1 o'clock,
. but "it was nearly 2 before it began.
* / Long before the hour a great throng
cf people, both adults and juveniles,
comrrrenced to fill every available point
of vantage surrounding it. Small boys
tjlimbed up into the top of the trees
â¢."Â»rid yelled and shouted with vigor to
the .great crowd of people below. The '
dance itself was a very pretty affair.
Suspended from the tall flagpole, which
'had been gayjy decked for the occasion
â¢"with bright evergreens, were long satin
streamers of red, white and blue.
Professor Findlay with a number of
the members of his dancing class had
. volunteered their services for the occa
* f=Ion- In the dance there were fourteen
beautiful little children, all dressed In
* v*hite and garlanded with floral
Vjeaths. It was a rare picture and one
that gave delight to all. The dance was
. delightfully executed, and the dainty
â¢little {ots went through the different
J evolutions with marvelous accuracy, to
â¢ the delight of the great crowd of spec
" tutors. Those that took part in the
flanre were Daisy Cumming, Violet
-Mhoon, Violet Long. Daisy Long, Lois

Â¦ rah to thousands. The merry-go-round
'â¢vas crowded to its utmost capacity.
"while the donkoy carts were laden
*w{rh children conveying them around
the grounds. At luncheon time the
park was a pretty sight. Mothers with
their little broods <^f children, with
grr-at baskets laden with luncheon,,
v-cre Featured from V,ne end of the
grounds to the other. Swings and may
poles a1Â«o afforded pleasure for the
.\ounjretTs.
* .Music was furnished by the juvenile
â¢band of thÂ«* Hebrew Orphan Asylum,
under the direction of H. Maurar. They
had volunteered their services. Early
in the afternoon they played enlivening
selections from the different operas and
then played for the children's maypole
dance. It was a great day for the
park. The weather was absolutely per
fect. v
The crowd in attendance was so tre
mendous it was found utterly impos
sible to get them back to town within
the prescribed limits vof time, which
was 5 o'clock, the hour the playground
is supposed to close. Oh account of
the great crowd Mrs. Milmore permit
ted the children to stay until G o'clock
and kept the refreshment pavilion open
until that hour.
The car lines were tested to .their
utmost capacity and were crowded to
overflowing during the entire day.
When it was considered that thousands
of children were in transit out and
back from the park it Is simply a mar
vel that no accidents were reported.

passed to print an ordinance raising the
standard of butter fat In milk to 3.3. per
cent during January, February. March

Mrs. Richards then took the stand.
She told how in April, 1899, she had
met the doctor in Los Angeles and had
kept company with him and how af
ter a very short time they became en
gaged. She also told how they had ar
ranged to come to this city to live,
and denied emphatically that "Willing
ham ever offered to furnish a tlat for
her if she would abandon what he
styled her pursuit of him.
" "We were to be married and live in
the flat," she said, "and Dr. Willlng
ham knows it." . ,
Under* cross-examination Mrs. Rich
ards made a willing witness. She grew
nervous and excited at times, but made
few contradictory statements, and sev
eral times made explanatory remarks
that showed that if she once loved the
doctor the feeling she had for him
now was entirely different. She even
Insinuated that once while she was
in Dallas, Texas, and while WUling
ham was alsot there, an attempt had
been made to poison her. She said she
never followed Wiiiingham about the
country, but said that on the contrary,
after Wiiiingham had become enamor
ed of Mrs. Mary Tighe, an "old thing"
of Los Angeles, he had followed her
about and endeavored to get rid of her.
She said she lived in constant dread
that he would attempt to kill her.
Shortly before the court adjourned
a letter written by Mrs. Richards to
Willingham's folks was introduced. In
this letter the plaintiff described her
association with the physician and told
that she and the doctor were to be
married in September and take up their
residence at 1116% Larkin street, San
Francisco. She also, told how.Willing
ham was being influenced by Mary
Tighe. .
The case will go on again to-day.
Willlngham took the stand again at
2 o'clock. He evaded a great many of
the attorney's questions and sought
by his answers to show that he was be
ing oersecuted by the plaintiff. He
said that when in September, 1900, he
left Los Aneeles to come to this city
Mrs. Richards took the same train. He
said he was much surprised to see her,
having had no knowledge that she in
tended coming here and then and there
offered to furnish her a fiat in this
city if she would cease paying her un
welcome attentions. She accepted the
offer, he said. â¢
PLAINTIFF OX STAXD.
The questioning of Wiiiingham was
almost too much for Mrs. Richards, but
she kept to her task and succeeded in
getting him to admit that they were
together a great deal in Los Angeles,
that he had given her money and that
he had agreed to furnish her a flat at
1116V4 Larkin street in this city. He
would not admit, however, that there
was any engagement between them.
It was at this stage of the proceed
ings that H. Digby-Johnston appeared
on the scene and took up the plaintiff's
burden. The court adjourned, however,
before he had a chance to examine the
doctor.
Then she turned her attention tb
"Wiiiingham, who, when his name was
called, stepped jauntily to the witness
stand and gazed unabashed at the wo
man who is seeking from him mone
tary balm for her injured feelings, and
who, in a brave effort to secure a
righting of the alleged wrong done her,
was standing before him, quivering and
shaking, not with fear, but at the
strangeness of her . surroundings and
the unusual position she found herself
in.
WILL.IXGIIAM EVASIVE.
Before the arrival of Sir Digby-John
ston, Mrs. Richards succeeded, despite
the objections of Ray Saffold, attorney
for the physician, in enacting the role
of Portia in a fairly successful manner.
She selected her own jury, and when
Judge Graham, as the twelfth man
took his seat in the jury box, inquired
If the Jury was satisfactory, she re- f
plied:
"They all look good to me."
She was told that the looks of a' jury
had little to do with t:ie verdict it
would render, but she repeated her re
mark, and added, "They may in this
case."
Like a knight of the days of chivalry,
Attorney H. Dlgby-Johnston yesterday
came to the rescue of a damsel in dis
tress. He dropped into- Judge Graham's
court during the progress of the trial
of the suit ftfr 525,000 damages brought
by Mrs. Emma Richards against Dr.
J. J. Willlngham of Los Angeles, found
the lady tearfully and nervously en
deavoring to present her case to a jury
and promptly volunteered his services.
The offer was accepted by Mrs. Rich
ards, who cheerfully relinquished her
self-imposed task of proving that Will
lngham had trifled with her affections,
and turned over her first witness, Will
lngham himself, to the English barris
ter. Thereupon things ran more
smoothly and all danger of Mrs. Rich
ards giving way to an attack of hy
steria was remcrved.

The registration for to-day's election
does not exceed 33,000. It is estimated
that there will be 70,000 votes on the
register for the August primary and
85,000 for the Presidential election in
November next.
The Democrats to-day will elect 16S
delegates to the State convention of the
party, which liP-s been called to meet at
Santa Cruz on May 16. There is no
open fifiht against the delegates pro
posed by the so-called "organization"
of the party in San Francisco, but the
Hearst forces may spring tickets, in
several of the Assembly districts to
day if a very light vote on the part of
the "organization" opens the way for
the success of opposition.
William M. Cutter of Yuba, chairman
of the Republican State Committee, is
in the city. _J3. D. Murphy, chairman
of the Democratic State Committee,
left the city a few days ago for San
Jose.
The Republicans of the Fourth Con
giessional District, in accordance with
a call issued- by the district governing
body of the party, will to-day elect
delegates tc a separate convention for
the purpose of choosing two delegates
and two alternates to represent the said
Congressional district in the Chicago
convention. All the Congressional dis
tiicts of the State, however, will be
represented in the State convention at
Sacramento. In other than the Third
ar.d Fourth districts the delegates elect
ee! to the State convention will* also
serve a.% Congressional district' dele
gates. The governing" body of the party
in each Congressional district was given
authority by the State Central Commit
tee to call for the election of separate
delegates or one set of delegates for
both conventions. Delegates to nom
inate candidates for Congress will not
be chosen until the August primary
election.
The polls for the primary election to
day will open at 6 a. m. and close at
5 p. m. All signs point to a light vote,
as there are no contests of a spirited
character in any other than the Thirty
ninth Assembly District, where there 13
a contest in the Republican ranks for
supremacy.
The Republicans to-day will elect 121
delegates to the Suite convention of the
party, which has been called to assem
ble at Sacramento on. Wednesday, May
18. This State convention will elect
lour delegates at large and- four alter
nates to the National Republican Con
vention, which is called to meet at Chi
cago June 21. As there is no Republi
can candidate for the Presidency other
than Theodore Roosevelt the conven
tion will pledge the delegation to his
support, select a new State Central
Committee and adjourn.

Policeman John P. Scanlan was to
day convicted in. the Police Court by
Police Judge Mortimer Smith of bat
tery upon J. J. Mulvey, a crippled
newsboy with whom Scanlan quarreled
over a bet on the Britt-Corbett fight.
Mulvey lost the bet, according to the
testimony heard by Judge Smith, and
Scanlan made a demand for the coin.
The loser asked for delay, saying he
did not have^the money with him.
Thereupon Scanlan got into a very
warm argument, during which some
strong swearing was done by Mulveyâ
enough to greatly enrage the police
man. It was then that Scanlan lost
his temper" and kicked Mulvey.
Scanlan did not deny the charge ot
battery, but has justified his actions
by declaring that he was provoked by
Mulvey beyond reason.
Sentence was postponed until
Wednesday. On Friday Scanlan will
be compelled "to face charges before
the Board of Police and Fire Commis
sioners growing out of the trouble with

OAKLAND, May 2.â The total
Â©mount of delinquencies in the col
lection of this year's taxe3 footed up
â¢to-day shows that $14â¬,024 71 remains
â¢unpaid on the books of County Tax
Collector Barber. This Is an excess
over last year of J111.04S 76, but is
â¢ "accounted for by the fact that the
taxes of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany have not been paid, owine to
a Sl.000.000 increase in its assess
ment.
In speaking of the shortage that
Â¦will result Auditor Bacon said to
-day: "We allow quite a margin for
â¢delinquencies, and as there was some
question over the taxing of the water
. in the Contra Costa's reservoirs we
made an extra allowance, and I do
Â«iot believe the funds will be disturb
ed by the unusual shortage."

The general subjects of Dr. Stanley's
lectures will be "Music in Its Relations
to Life" and "The History of Music."
The first will treat of music in educa
tion. In worship, the function of the
music-room, the applieation-of the prin
ciples of criticism to music and the
ethical influence of certain great move
mentsâfor example, the troubadours,
minnesingers and mastersingers. This
â¢ourse is more particularly for music
teachers, but it will be nevertheless in
teresting and instructing to others. The
second course will be devoted to the
consideration of the evolution of music
os seen in its history. It will be illus
trated from works of the most im
portant epochs, and a number of lec
tures will be given with the aid of the
streopticon.
If a sufficient number of students de
sire it, Dr. Stanley will give a course
in harmony. A large chorus will be
formed, which will meet one or two
evenings each week for the study of
such choral works as may seem feasi
ble.
BERKELEY, May 2.â Instruction In
music is to be offered for the first time
in the history of the University of CaU
ifornia at the coming session of the
summer school. Music is a subject that
universities have left for the regularly
organized schools of music to take up,
but the scope of the 'university. is_ wid
ening more and more, and in time It
is expected that fully organized depart
ments to teach the gentle art will-be
numbered among the activities of all of
them. More attention is paid to music
at the University of California just
now than ever before, and the signs
point to a time when courses will be
offered as part of the curriculum. This
arrangement for the summer school is
one of the signs. It may be looked
upon as a wedge for something greater
-and permanent.
Dr. Albert A. Stanley, professor of
music at the University of Michigan,
which already boasts a department of
music, is coming to teach the art and
theory of music at the summer session.
He has taught music for sixteen years
at 'Michigan and has^gajned some re

Miss LArzie Ixx* f With Mania for Sui
cide. Tries to Drink Carbolic
Acid.
. BERKELEY. May 2. â Miss Lizzie
: Lbeb, a young lady living with her
njother in West Berkeley, gave way to
â¢ her mania for suicide and attempted
.to take her life last night bydraining
a bottle of carbolic acid. The timely
arrival of Deputy Marshal William C.
Carey prevented her from carrying
â¢ out her intent. The trouble which led
Miss Lee to the determination to de
stroy herself arose from a trivial
quarrel with her mother.
Miss L/oeb has made several at
tempts to leave the world by hen own
act during the last" few years. The
Oakland police are acquainted with
the young woman, as on at least two
occasions she has hired a room in a
lodging-house In that city with the
resolution to take her life. Her most
recent escapade was. an attempt to
drink poison in a butcher-shop in
West Berkeley. At that time the
young woman vigorously protested
T..hat she was overcome by a violent fit.
The doctor that was called in, how
jever. told a different story.
, Miss Loeb's latest attempt at sui
â¢ cide was brought about by her moth
er's refusal to allow her to ffo with
another young woman.

United States Circuit Judges Gilbert,
Ross and Morrow and United States
District Judge Hawley opened the May
session of the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals yesterday.

the Judgment of United States District
Judge de Haven confirming the report
of United States Commissioner Hea
cock, who recommended the deporta
tion of Tsoi Yii. Yee Yuen, Cheung
Him Nim, Chew Iling-, Lee Yue and
Chin Chew Fons were denied.
It was contended by the attorneys
for the Government that section 13 or
the act of September, 1888, gives the
right of appeal only from the ruling
of the Commissioner to the Judge of
the District Court, and that the de
cision of such Judge is not the Judg
ment of the Court and not a final de
cision appealable to the Circuit Court
of Appeals.- . V \ â¢'.
After quoting several . decisions of
the Supreme Court to show that the
decision in of the District Judge in this
particular case is a fihaKdecision, the
Circuit Court of Appeals says:
If appeals could be taken In those cases to
the Supreme Court they could be entertained
only en the ground that the decision of tnÂ»
District Court on an appeal from a Commls
slcner*s decision was a Judgment of thÂ« Dis
trict Court, and, as such, a final decision from
which an appeal could b? taken.

John Berg lives after falling four
stories and landing upon a mass of
metal beams at the new First National
Bank building now being built on
Shattuck avenue and Center street. It
was a miraculous escape from death
or frightful injury, for Berg only sus
tained a broken rib and a deep cut
across the left ankle.
Berg's plunge through the air was
observed by a large number of people
waiting: for the train at Berkeley sta
tion this morning. There was a clash
of structural work and rigging at the
new building, and a heavy steel girder
went flying downward. In Its flight
it struck the platform .upon -which
Berg, who is a machinist, was station
ed, and smashed it instantly. Berg fell
with the whole mass and landed in the
basement. .
The fixing of water rates will proceed

night.
J. H. MacDonald, who bought for
5S500 franchises on College avenue and
in East Oakland for an electric rail
road, has, through F. E. Chapin, as
assignee, made application to the City
Council for a return of the JS500, claim
ing that there are defects in the call
for bids that render void the Council's
action in granting the franchises.
. Pendleton said he had
been requested by Mayor Olney to an
nounce that the Mayor would, in. view
of the failure' of the arbitration scheme,
reopen negotiations with the Bay Cities
Water Company looking toward the
submission of bids to furnish the city
with an independent water supply. In
the special committee's report they an
nounce that Reginald H. Thomson, City
Engineer of Seattle, had been selected
as the city's representative on the
board of arbitration." . "
The scheme of arbitratioir^to get the
value of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany's plant for rate fixing purpose 3
has failed.. After months of labor the
special committee of the City Council
appointed to name the city's represent
ative on the proposed board of arbi
trators reported that the plan could
not be legally carried out according to
an opinion rend'ered by City Attorney
McElroy. With its report the commit
tee submitted the voluminous cor
respondence had with President Wil
liam J. Dingee and showing that the
water company and the committee
were unable to meet upon a basis of
agreement concerning what should' be
taken as necessary items by the ex
perts in finding the value of the portion
of the company's plant required to sup
ply the city of Oakland.
President Dornin of the special com
mittee said it had been impossible to
bind the water company to the original
agreement and also to Induce President
Dingee to stand upon his first agree
ment as binding upon the water com
pany alone and not upon the city.
After the report had been read and
filed the committee, which was com
posed of Chairman Dornln, Councilmen
Pendleton and Cuvelller, was, at its
own request, discharged. " .

to get our work before our merchants, keep
them advised of what was being done, and to
turnlsh news to the trade papers of our

rious obstacle to overcome, and that is tiiÂ«
financing of our association. You will appreci
ate that the greater volume of our finances
conr.es from friends of organization work, and
for the b2tterment of the retailers' condition,
which In turn reverts upon the donors, who
arc directly, as manufacturer"*, interested in
the welfare or the retail merchant and be
lieve our National Association is deserving of
such assistance in tha plan we are following
to improve the conditions of the retail mer
chants by education and co-operation, which
can be brought about only by organized efforts,
of our association. Until we can finance our
association by a per capita tax large enough
to pay all legitimate expenses, I believe it
wise to make no change.
We are making rapid strides in rating and
collecting system*. Some pans of our country
are\much in advancs of others. To make It
possible for a personal Investigation Into the
best system that has come under my inspec
tion, and to have the system thoroughly ex
plained to you at this convention, N. M. Olson,
secretary of Galesburg Association, Illinois, has
brought to this convention and has opened for
your Inspection the Galesburg system, which
has been indorsed by our National Association,
and should merit your attention. 1 want you all
to see him and have it explained, to satisfy
yourselves that the system is worthy of your
consideration.
Mutual fire Insurance is becoming a great
factor In the Insurance field and of valuable
assistance in association work, and has proven
wherever tried that it is a good proposition and
worthy of indorsement and the support by the
retail merchants of this country. H is no ex
periment, but an assured fact; your Interests
are better protected and your premiums ma
terially reduced. You will hear regarding this
work during our convention, and I would *ug
geFt that you make It your business to be here
when the topic and plan will be presented by
E. A. Taylor of Fargo. N. D.. who Is on our
programme for Wednesday afternoon.
The afternoon session was late in be
ing called to order, as the president de
sired to give the committee on creden
tials plenty of time to complete its
work. At 2 o'clock it was concluded
best to proceed without the report and
the convention was called to order.
Secretary Mason read his report, which
covered fifteen pages of printed matter.
The history of the association was
given from the time of its inception
up to the seventh annual convention
now in session. It waa shown that the
association has a membership of 18,000.
Mr. Mason took' the ground that the
association, was one of educational
character and of beneficial nature to
all retail grocers. The total receipts
were shown to be $17,197 20 for the year
ending April 15, 1904. and disbursements
to the amount of $15,813, Success ob
tained by the association in various
States was cited as" beneficial" to the
entire organization. I Trading stamps
were spoken of as one of the greatest
evils the retail grocers had to encoun
ter. At the conclusion of the. report
a rising vote of thanks was given the
secretary.
The annual report of the treasurer
was read by Treasurer F..M. Newland
and coincided in every respect with the
figures given- by Secretary Fred Ma
son's report: '-~
All State presidents were appointed
by the chair to serve as a committee
on resolutions, and Moore of Indiana,
Green of Ohio and Sullivan of Mis
souri as an auditing committee.

turning on the gas before he /retired
last night. His body was, found about
noon to-day.
Gowell left- a note addressed to a
friend stating that he had gambled
about SHOO -at various resorts in this
city. He came here from Seattle
about a , week ago with drafts and
checks and" after spending these he
drew on Seattle banks for more funds.
At first his drafts were honored, but
for the last two days the drafts have

serve during the convention.
Owing to the absence of P. G. Han
sen of Minnesota, C. H. Tebbetts sub
mitted, the annual report of the ways
and means committee. The report
went into the details of how the vari
ous sums of money had been raised i
during the year and the treatment the !
committee had received at the hands
of the various â¢ manufacturer's. The j
committee hoped that the per capita |
tax would soon be sufficient to furnish
the association with all the funds it
would need, without going outside for
contributions. As an individual mem- i
ber. of the- committee, Mr. Hansen, '
through Mr. Tebbetts, said he desired, ,
when the time came to pass upon the
selection of the next meeting place,
to cast his vote for Niagara Falls.
A telegram from Fred Lorend of
Fond du lac, Wis., congratulating. the
association on its seventh annual con
vention, was read and referred to the
committee. on resolutions.
The annual report of P. P. Otterbach
of Washington, D. C.,' chairman of the j
committee on legislation, was read by !
Assistant Secretary Weis, owing to
Mr. Otterback's absence. Trouble which
has grown up between the Washington,
D. C, retail association and the nation
al association caused the withdrawal
of the Washington association from the j
national, and In consequence Mr. Otter- i
back tendered his resignation. The re- i
port was referred to the committee on
resolutions.
A lengthy telegram from the Natural
Food Company, which should have
been delivered at Denver while a num
ber of the delegates were on their way
West, was read.
. Vice President A. W. Farlinger, who
Is chairman of the pure food committee,
stated he would make his report this
morning.
William Gray of Brooklyn, N. Y., was
called UDon to fill in time with an ad
dress. As he is down on the programme
to-day for an address .on- "Early and
Sunday Closing" in a State that has no
Sunday closing law he said he would
prefer to go to his room and prepare a
coat of armor to resist any darts which
might be shot at him. He did hope,
though, the next convention would be
held at Niagara Falls.
Organizer Spain of Washington, who
is a fluent and easy speaker, delivered
a short address, In which he took for
the basis of his talk the "Glorious Cli
mate of California." No selfish interests
should be evidenced by the delegates of
the convention, he contended, for byÂ»
the co-operation of all the commercial
interests of the country could be ad
vanced.
E. T. Ashley, ex-treasurer of the as
sociation, told the convention that his
State â Ohio â has one of the best asso
ciations in the Union. He Is now serv
ing his fifth term as president of the
Ohio Retail Grocers' Association. Every j
time that association went before, the '
Legislature of the State they secured :
what they asked. In order to get a i
garnishment law you must have the
labor element behind you. When it is :
properly explained to labor organiza- j
tions they will co-operate to secure ,lhe \
proper laws, which prove a benefit to!
the laborer and merchant alike. i
Ludwig Warnke, president of the Ala
meda County Retail Grocers' Associa
tion, extended an Invitation to all the
delegates and their familieS--to spend
all day Wednesday across the bay,
where they will be entertained with
sightseeing and luncheon.
At 4:35 o'clock the report of the com-
LOS ANGELES. May 2.â Aa the re
sult of a smash-up at the end of a
wild ride on a runaway bicycle down
a steep mountain trail near Hollywood,
F. P. Maulsbury. a carpenter of this
city, is lying at the Pass Hotel with a
fractured skull, broken jaw and cheek
bones and deep cuts and bruises on his
face and body. .
Maulsbury attempted 'to coast down
the steep winding three miles of road
in the Cahuenga Pass, but lost control
of 'his machine and at one of the sharp
curves in the road crashed into; a ledge
of rock with terrific force, demolishing
his machine and perhaps fatally in
juring himself. Physicians say his re
covery is doubtful. "
The point at which the accident oc
curred is one at which several similar
ones have happened. '.'. .

mittee on credentials was . read - and
adopted.' That action was recognized
as completing the organization of the
convention. ,
The chair appointed the following del
egates as committee on rules: Ashley
of Ohio, Tebbetts of Ililinols, Akers of
Michigan, Kramer of Arkansas and
Sullivan of Missouri. The members at
orice retired to discuss the matter, in
their charge.
Elisha Winters was recommended by
the Kansas City Credltmen's Associa
tion to a seat in the convention. The
committee on credentials reported ad
versely on Mr. Winters being seated.
Winters asked the privilege of the floor
to explain the object of his being pres
ent. His reQuest was granted for five
minutes.
Speaking rapidly, he appealed to the
various delegates not to turn him down.
W. E. Sullivan of St. Joseph. Mo., se
cured the floor and opposed the seating
of .any persons who were not retail
merchants. He had the backing of the
entire State of Missouri on that sub
ject, and "if you don't believe me, ask
the Mlssourians, and 'they'll show
you.' "
W. H. Cook of Ohio seconded the re
marks of Sullivan, on the ground that
collecting agents had caused more trou
ble than anything else, and no collect
ing agent should be given a seat In the
convention.
James Lillls of Topeka, Kans.,
thought the matter should be thorough
ly investigated before action was taken
and moved that the motion to not seat
Mr. Winters be laid on the table. There
was no second to the-motlon.
George H. Scherer of Illinois took the
ground that it would be a violation of
the constitution to. seat any one but a
retail grocer as a delegate. It^ias been
the custom for courtesies to be extend
ed to any one who wishes to address
the convention, but not to seat them as
delegates.
A vote was taken as the result of a
: call for the previous question, and Mr.
Winters was denied a seat as a dele
gate. -
A resolution introduced by A. H.
Powers of California calling upon the
executive committee to prepare such
changes to the constitution as may be
deemed expedient and submit the same
to the next convention, was read and
referred to the committee on resolu
tions.
At 5:30 the convention adjourned un
til this morning at 10 o'clock in order
that the delegates might prepare for
the receDtion at the Ferry building in
i the evening.
Extensive preparations had been
; made in the upper corridor of the
! building to demonstrate to the vlsl
; tors that Californians do not do things
! by halves. From one end of the prom
(enade to the other archways of red.
I white and blue electric lights shed
their rays on the throng that strolled
along the stone floor, while every avail
! able space that would accommodate
| large American flags was festooned
with the national emblem. Palms,
cut flowers and evergreens were taste
; fully scattered along the corridor, giv-
way officially welcomed the delegates |
to the city. i
Joseph A. Stultz, president of the ,'
California Retail and Merchants' Asso- j
elation, announced that Governor Par- j
dee would be unable to attend the .
opening of the convention as he had j
a prior engagement to address the :
Methodists' General Conference In
Los Angeles at that time. The speaker
read a telegram from the Governor to
that effect and proceeded to welcome
the delegates to the State in behalf
of its chief executive. The speaker's
remarks were greeted with continued
applause.
In response to the hearty welcome
extended the delegates, George A.
Scherer of Peoria, 111., past president
of the association, acknowledged with
gratitude the good fellowship displayed
and vouched for the members of the
convention realizing the genuineness
of the welcome.
President Charles R. Lott of Chicago
assumed the chair 'and delivered the
annual address as follows:
AÂ» president of your organization It become*
ray duty to render an accounting at this time
legardlcg my administration and what work
has bÂ»en accomplished. Experience along this
line suggests to my mind a number of recom
mendations that I believe will be to the wel
fare of the members of the National Associa
tion, jphtch I ehall enumerate later on, and to
make recommendations and suggestions relative
to the welfare of the retail merchants of this
country. This will take us back fifteen months
at Kansas City, where I was entrusted with
thÂ« office of president. I stated at that time
that It was my earnest Intention to use my best
endeavors to build up and strengthen our in
stitution. I have tried to keep my Â¦word. The
report* you will receive from your officer"
at this convention are respectfully submitted
for your earnest consideration and approval
of the work and decisions we rendered during
this term. We have met with criticism for
opinions rendered, but I hope that time will
prove that the judgment we as your officers
arrived at waa wise and fair in^every case.
I can say that we meet here to-day with a
much larger and stronger association than was
entrusted to the care of the officers and ex
ecutive committee you elected at your last
convention. I r.m more than pleased to havo
had the honor cf being your president during
the past fifteen month*. Many days have I
cpent In the Interest of your association. The
correspondence has been very heavy, but thia
has been lightened by the very good fellow
feeling that existed among your officers. Har
mony has dona much to advance our work
and made porsible the enormous growth
we have enjoyed. It has also made It Incum
bent upon me to visit many State and local
association meetings during the year to en
courage their efforts in Improving the condi
tions of their merchants. I can safely say
that they were materially Improved where we
Lave done our missionary work. This has
been our greatest work and has covered our
country pretty generally, taking much time and
money. This work was principally left In the
hands of Secretary Mason and myself, owing
to the fact that he la exceptionally well adapt
ed to this work.
We have been exceptionally fortunate In
financial matters. Our per capita tax was the
largest ever paid, but nowhere near what was
required to run this association upon the pro
gressive plans outlined by the executive board
at the Kansas City, convention, had It not been
for our kind friends who eo generously donated
such magnificent sums to be used to enlighten,
educate and to better the conditions of our re
tall merchants. Many seriou* evils annoy and
worry our merchants. Each section of our coun
try has Its own troubles, which it seems to me
ehould be seriously considered by the local and
State association, and If the same cannot be
adjusted the national stands ready and willing
to assist In settling In an amicable manner.
General problems should receive tba considera
tion of our national, which stands to protect
the interests of the merchants at Washington.
This is much easier said than done. Especially
Is this the case In our National Association,
where the legislative work Is very alow, and our
merchants can hardly spare 'the long delays in
time to fight to a finish an Imne such as we
have been battling with. Ever since our Incep
tion much work has been done that -we don't
Â«*e or hear of, yet It. takes. the time of your
legislative committee. Often you are reminded
to eend a letter or see your Senator or Repre
sentative regarding a bill or measure which is
of great interest to your welfare and requires
a concerted action. How many will take tlms
to assist or follow instructions sent you by this
legfelative committee, who are not only , taking
Uielr time for this work, but must keep punch-
farther and with most serious rapidity and
detriment to those who have become ensnared
Is the trading stamp evil, owing to th<- fact
that this proposition is not always explained
in its proper light by the salesman represent
ing these companies to our merchants, but he
is wlsw enough to have a contract signed by the
merchant for a year that will in his opinion
compel him to use their stamps, no matter
what his interest is in the proposition after
having had a short experience with the same.
We havo in many places successfully com
bated agr. inut this expensive ar.d delusive
system. This problem will come before you
during our session, and It Is my hope that
through our efforts we can eliminate this evil
and benelit our merchants where this trouble
exists. We believe to keep our National Asso
ciation before the public is a great factor for
organization, and for the purpose to keep our

to'mary hoFDitality of Californians was
o xxended to the delegates, their wives,
daughters and sweethearts, and before
midnight had thrown its silent mantle
around the city the visitors realized
their former convention at Kansas City
had acted wisely In selecting San Fran-
Visco for this year's convention.
Words of welcome to the citv of the
(jol'den Gale were delivered by T. H.
Corcoran, president of San Francisco

vention to order. In extending the wel
come he said the members of the local

The recent convention of leading educators and State

and to advance the standard of excellence which inspires
our army of teachers was of such marked intelligence

LYNCH UVW â T>. B. F.. Oakland.
Cal. Lynch law is the infliction* of
punishment on persons accused of
heinous offenses by people not legally
authorized to inflict punishment for
crime. It is said to have derived its
name from John Lynch, a farmer of
Carolina, who, about the first of the
eighteenth century, exercised sum
mary punishment â lashes, torture and
even death, as he saw fit â upon fu
gitive slaves and criminals, either
white or black, who at one time In
fested the D(smal Swamp and sallied
forth from time to time to prey upon
the neighboring plantations. The
colonial authorities In those days fail
ing to pursue and recapture despera
does, John Lynch and his neighbor3
took the law into their own hands.
â¢-^ ONGRESSMAN HEARST is using his stringed
I and syndicated newspapers to destroy the char-
acter of the Congress of which he is a member.
A careful reading of his indictment reveals the fact that
Congress is a failure because it did not adopt "The
Hearst measures." The House consists of the Republi
can majority and a minority composed of Mr. Hearst.
This minority says it had a hard time trying to do some
thing for the people.
In a Washington dispatch to "the New York Commer
cial we get a picture of Mr. Hearst's colors, in a descrip
tion of his appearance before the Judiciary Committee
to read a prepared 'speech, an hour in time and longitude,
on the matter of the coal trust, so called. The reporter
says that the minority would. read a while and then sit
down until "the power" came and then he Would' rise
and read some more. ',
As nearly as the committee could make # out he was at
tacking the rate of transportation on 'Â¦oal to. seaboard
points. He was diverted from his written speech only
once, when a member of the committee asked him if he
thought the . rate was too high, and -whether he knew
that the roads-could get any profit on the service at a
HEARST ON CONGRESS.
The interesting coincidence has been noticed at Berke
ley that the higher an average student steps on the lad
der of learning the\more. he undermines his health and
harasses the peace of his friends by the habit of
cigarette smoking. The" situation should be accepted
with complacency. Inveterate cigarette smoking is
deadly and serves the wise purpose of removing individ
uals that otherwise would be obstructions in the intelli
gent struggle for existence. -.
Oakland has been seeking to discover of late whether
a distressing series of midnight hold-ups be not due to
practical jokers rather than to footpads. Under the cir
cumstances it is safe to say that any assault upon a
night wayfarer, whatever the motive, is no joke. It
may be idiocy, but it should be treated as crime..

"No sabe," was the sum of the satis
faction the Celestial vouchsafed and
Irones was searching for a policeman
when the barrier went up and the race
started.
The winner was the horse whose
name was printed on the medico's
ticket. He was the only man at the
track who had played that horse ana
he cashed the pasteboard for $125%,
Dr. Irones, surgeon on the steamship
Coptic, was swindled into $1250 the last
time he was at Hongkong. He attend
ed the races there with some Standard
Oil clerks who owned a horse that was
to start that day. The Standard OH
nag was favorite and Irones decided to
bet five dollars on its chances. Th*Â»
betting scheme at Hongkong is on the
pari nlutuel order. For each horse
that starts there' is a separate betting
booth presided over by a Chinese book
maker. The total amount invested, less
a commission, is divided in proportion
to the amount of the bet among those
holding tickets on the winner. Irones
got into the wrong booth and bought
five dollars' worth of a horse that had
never won anything. His friends told
him of his mistake and the surgeon de
manded that the Chinese bookmaker
return his monev.
The Great Luck.
This season marks the first annual mobilization of
the regulars and the National Guardsmen of the Pacific
Coast departments and States. The interest will be keen
by reason of the novelty of the events. For the guards
men the encampments will take on less of a holiday
outing character than on some previous occasions.
Rigid discipline will be maintained. Strict attention to
learning the duties^of the soldier, with the best of in
structorsâthe officers of the regular army â will be
expected. Natural pride on the part of the citizen sol
diery will prompt them to equal the regulars in all par
ticulars, if possible. On the part of the regulars there
will be a business-like following of military duty that will
prove to be a valuable lesson to those who are less fa
miliar with the arts of war.
Regular soldiers are not^ fashioned without long ex
perience in actual campaigning, but the maneuvers of
the months of July and August will be of some perma
nent value to the guardshien. Americans have always
been easily converted into soldiers from the timfc,_6f
Bunker Hill and New Orleans to the bloody days of the
Civil. War, and later, in the war between the United
States and Spain. General intelligence is the basis of
this phenomenon. That will be a factor in military
progress .the coming summer on. this coast. The public
will be entertained by the military pageantry. The
National Guardsmen and the regulars will mutually im
prove by contact. â¢
MUCH will probably be accomplished for the
benefit of the National Guardsmen of the Pacific
Coast during the coming summer. Major > Gen
eral MacArthur has conferred with Adjutant General
Lauck of the National Guard of California, relative to
the co-operation of the State troops with those of the
regular army, and i^ has been agreed that the regulars
and the National Guardsmen shall encamp together and
maneuver together in August, at some place in the
interior yet to be selected.
The California guardsmen who will take part will
number at, least 2000. Major General MacArthur says
that it is his intention to devote .fifteen days to the
maneuvers. Several thousand regular soldiers will be
encamped with the guardsmen. All the men will be
instructed, under the eyes of regular army experts, in
the duties of camp life and the movements of actual
war.
During the encampment the guardsmen will receive
the same pay as the regulars and the same rations, and
will in brief, be on even terms with the regulars.
Brigadier General Funston, commander of the Depart
ment of the Columbia, announces that the National
Guardsmen of Oregon, Washington and Idaho will be
mobilized with the regular troops in his department and
that they will go into camp near American Lake, in
the vicinity of Tacoma, from July 7 to July 21, inclusive
of both dates. The Oregon Journal says that there will
be in the northern camp of instruction 4500 men and
their officers. Of the entire force 1300 will be regular
troops. â¢ â¢
As in California, so in the north, the Government
provides Yor the cost of the joint encampment of the
guardsmen and the regulars. The grounds are selected
by the Government under the guidance of the army
officers and the Government also prepares , the camp
site for occupation. . Practically, all the regulars in the
Department of the Columbia, with the exception of those
in Alaska, will be brought together for instruction at
Tacoma. The encampments will provide for two weeks
of instruction ill real army work.
IMPROVING THE GUARDSMEN.
I scarcely envy any one his first at
tempt at shooting rapid3 if he suffers
as I did. From an overhanging rock
I had carefully watched a, guide go
through the galloping, foamy waters,
and then, after emptying my canoe
and leaving my watch and other un
necessary articles on shore and putting
my heart carefully into my mouth. I
made for that noisy little run of water.
What I suffered when the curling
wavelets first struck the canoe was bad
enough, but nothing to the agony of
the return trip, when, traveling with
startling speed, the whole river seemed
a mass of menacing rocks being boiled
in the seething water. How I got
through- 1 do not know; but I came
safely to the smooth water, and. after
a rest, made another run with less
trepidation. Then, loading the canoe
with my light outfit, I took her through
with little difficulty.
To give any description of handling
a canoe in rapids would be waste of
time both for the writer and the read
er, says a writer in Country Life in
America. The best way to learn is
first to watch some one do it, and then
try it yourself under his direction. You
will soon find out which is the safe
water and how to force the light craft
over the seemingly impossible fall3.
Running rapids, provided they are not
too bad, appeals to me as one of the
most exciting forms of sport and ex
ercise that I know of. Never attempt
a rapid that you do not know can be
run, without examining it from end to
end to see that it is possible and also
to get an idea how to take it. Many
a man has lost his life through neglect
ing this precaution, and remember that
a rapid which is safe to-day may not
be so in a day or two, as the rising
and falling of the water will frequent
ly make it impassable or at least very
dangerous.
Handling a Canoe.
An Oakland police officer was placed under official fire
recently for betting on a prize-fight. While the action
of the authorities was unquestionably justified, we would
have been better pleased if they had made it clearer
whether the indictment was idiocy or immorality. The
offense as practiced in San Francisco is almost invariably
an exhibition of both.
Probably it will be news to most
Americans that London for years has
had what might be called a "perma
nent" negro minstrel show. London Is
about to lose It, however,, in conse

THE British East Indian Government last year di
rected Mr. Priestly of the Indian Railway. Depart
ment to examine and report upon railroads and
railroad methods in the United States. His report -is
printed as a government blue book, and its conclusions
may be studied with profit by our own people, who arc
accustomed to so much criticism of the policy and work
ings of our railroad system.
The Indian railroads are government ownership en
terprises, and as Mr. Priestly's report puts them in con
trast with ours, it goes beyond the mere question of oper
ation and rates, and bears directly upon the larger qucs-"
tion of private and public ownership. The first thing in
cur system that struck him was the freedom of. indi
vidual initiative among the officers and employes on
American roads, making men willing to assume respon
sibility and to do their duty fearlessly, because they are
to be judged by the industrial and not the political stand
ard. He calls this the recognition, of the fact that the
best results are to be had by allowing every man to run
on his own feet. Under this he admits that mistakes
may be made, that might be v prevented by pre
cautions that would destroy individuality, but" such
precautions would in the long run destroy the efficiency
of the men and deprive the employer of their best efforts.
Under our system as it is, every man d"oes his best un
restrained, and the desire to advance himself by merit
causes him to strive solely for the best results, and to
accept responsibility. When men learn to. put respon
sibility elsewhere the disposition is to pass it on, so
that shirking and inefficiency are concealed as to the
point of origin, and are, felt .only by a progressive de
cline in the entire business. This is plainly seen on the
government roads of Australia, where it results in large
deficits that are finally charged off to the public tax
payer.
He regards railroading in America as a profession
practiced to the highest efficiency, in which the man who
begins at the bottom may expect to reach the top by in
dustry, fidelity and initiative. The correctness of this con
clusion is proved in the history of our railways. A long
list of men in important administrative places at the
head shows that the royal road to success begins at the
bottom and is climbed successfully upon merit and
achievement alone.
As to rates, Mr. Priestly finds ours the lowest in the
world, and says this is brought about by making a rate
that will move the traffic and then getting profit by
economy in moving it. He is puzzled to find that our
rates are far belo\\- those of the Indian railways because
the average da'ily wage of unskilled labor .in this country
equals the average monthly wage in India, and the same
proportion is maintained through the service. Finding
our railway wages the highest in the world and our rates
on traffic the lowest, he feels himself in the presence of
an industrial miracle.
The fact is that efficiency keeps pace with compensa
tion under our system, which makes every railway em
ploye the architect of his own fortune. The section
hand or member of a freight crew need not feel that he
is always to be a section hand or face weather on the
hurricane deck of a freight train. There is no system
of playing favorites to prejudice his advance if it is in
him. Nor is there the paralyzing restraint of political
management to make him a cog in the wheels of govern
ment ownership. He is a free agent with his fate in his
own hands, and the god^of his own destiny.
As commercial enterprises, Mr. Priestly finds our rail
roads on a scale that has no rival in the world, receiving
no partnership protection from the state, and fighting
their way to the front by ability alone. Before conclud
ing he finds it necessary to apologize for his enthusiasm
by declaring that it is impossible to associate with the
men great in American railway administration without
being infected by their enthusiasm and devotion to their
profession. .
He credits private management with wonderful alert
ness in seeing a new idea to increase the efficiency,
economy and safety of the business. Every railroad man
is earnestly seeking to get at the science of the business,
satisfied that under every art is a scientific foundation.
The study of how they do this makes association with
them like attendance upon a great college where practi
cal affairs are taught and where every student is prying
into reasons and storing his mind with facts.
The study of this report is quite a corrective of preju
dices formed at home against our railroad policy ''and
management, and gives rise to the suspicion that we see
its faults, which annoy us, more than its virtues, which
serve us better than any other people are served by
railway administration.
One thing is sure, this blue book obsoletes the argu
ments heretofore made for government ownership and
operation of our railroads. That campaign cannot be
renewed unless the proponents of public ownership can
show that it will hold the rate of progress shown by
private ownership and install a greater excellence of
administration than the people now enjoy. This we be
lieve to be impossible.
Unfortunately for me, my money
was invested in speculative concerns,
which, however, yielded high divi
dends, although in justice to myself ,
I must say that they were not of a i
gambling nature. I never bet on or
owned a race horse. B%ing in the so
called "swim," my city acquaintances
brought me frequent "tips" as to
"good things" in, which to deposit my
superfluous cash. Many of these
"good things" did not belie their de
scription. It must be admitted that
they swelled my banking account con
siderably. Others ended disastrously.
On the whole, however, I fared
amazingly well â so well, indeed, that
I improvidently neglected the ele
mentary precaution of .buying a rea
sonable number of securities to which
little or no risk was attached- This
is what I ought to have done to pro
vide for a rainy day.
Luckily the rainy day was slow in
coming. I enjoyed life. In the win
ter months I followed the sun in my'
yacht, always in the company of sev
eral friends; on occasions I chartered
special trains. In a word I was royal
ly extravagant. It was important to
note, however, in view of what fol
lows that my acquaintances benefited
by my extravagance rather more than
I did myself. They drank with re
markable freedom my expensive
champagne; they smoked my half
crown cigrars; they "swore" by my din
ners, each of which cost a little for
tune.
It will thus be gathered that in dis
tributing my shekels I did not think
only of myself. For some ten years I
reveled in my fifteen thousand a year;
then the war with the Boers broke out
and clouds began to gather. First, my
own business in the city, which had
been extremely profitable, collapsed
with extraordinary swiftness, leaving
me with unpleasant liabilities. In a few
months it was as dead as a door nail.
Further blows followed in rapid suc
cession. Speculation after speculation
with which I was connected went
wrong. There was a general smash up.
Up to this moment I had not dreamed
that complete shipwreck was in store
for me. T believed that the losses in
curred in my business would not per
manently affect my situation in life â
that they could be retrieved. Having
glanced through my correspondence, the
curtain which for bo long a space had
remained up revealing me as a con
spicuous figure in the drama of life as
played by the "smart set" fell with a
flop. I knew that my balance at the
bank â a mere Â£500 â was all that I had
of ready cash in the world. I knew, in
fact, that I was penniless, for my 500
sovereigns were needed to pay debts.
To describe my sensation Is, oddly
enough, an easy task. I am of a philo
sophical turn of mind. For a brief in
stant I was stunned. Then I recovered
and went on with my breakfast, with
my butler behind me. I ate heartily,
consuming more food than I had done
at breakfast for years. I felt light
hearted. Ah for my butler, he was so
admirably Informed as to the state of
my affairs that he gave me notice at
10 o'clock. I suspect that his desire to
know all about my private concerns
had led him to steam my envelopes.
Certainly the flaps of the envelopes pre
sented to me of a morning had for some
weeks past exhibited an unnatural
curliness. indicating that they had
either been exposed to the rain or that
they had been held over the spout of a
kettle. By midday all my servants were
under discharge. When receiving no
tice of dismissal their moods varied
curiously. The coachman's expression
was sardonic: my Italian chef wept
and vowed that he would follow me to
the ends of the earth; the grooms en
deavored vainly to conceal their smiles;
the housekeeper hoped that her salary
would be "all right.""^
The last scene of my human drama is
a short one. for the reason that it is
still being enacted. I was installed in
a nice house, exceedingly well fur
nished, which my nearest relatives
purchased for me. They made mean
allowance. My Income compared with
my former earnings is a small one. I
am still able to entertain, however, but
chairs at my table are vacant. With the
exception of two or three of the true
and tried brigade, not one oÂ£ those who
tÂ«wned and pressed their company
upon me In the high tide of my pros
perity visit me. In the streets they pass
me by with half a nod; in the old days
they shook me effusively by the hand,
reckoning no doubt what they would
get out of me. Yet I do not suffer. I
do not feel as If I had been shut out
in the cold. At present I resemble Mi
cawberâI am waiting for, something to
turn up. Fortunately, certain firms are
not cognizant of the fact that I< have
been engulfed. They' win send me busi
ness, and no doubt I shall be on my
feet again before many months Â« have
elapsedâ CassellV Saturday Journal.
It is now three years since the
catastrophe overtook me. Six and
thirty months ago I was in the enjoy
ment of an income of Â£15,000 a year.
I occupied a West End mansion in a
fashionable square, I kept my horses,
my carriages, my steam yacht, and I
entertained largely. My wine cellar was
celebrated; my cigars were beyond re
proach; my friends, invariably eager
to accept my invitations, were wealthy,
one and all.

you lose your money you forfeit your

less rate? After sitting down to concentrate his
thoughts, the minority said he didn't know, as he was
not familiar with the business! When he would get his
trolley on the car and rise to, read some more, other
questions were asked, to which, with marked hesitation,
he would make the same reply that he didn't know.
Now we submit that the majority, having found out
by this painful cross-examination how much Mr. Hearst
doesn't know about the legislation he proposed, should
have used his absence of knowledge, as the motive for
legislation. In that way it would have entered upon the
broadest kind of field, and could have planted it with
statutes and joint resolutions .until it looked like a
girdled clearing in the primitive forests of Indiana.
These champions of the people who are looking for a
Moses should have a show. Mr. Hearst has taken the
place in Congress long held by Calamity Weller, who
was sent to the House to get a law that would "give the
people a more and *a fittener currency." He was the
minority in his day, and the wicked majority said that
when his proposition would give the people "a more cur
rency" it. was not "a fittener," and when it was "a fit
tener" it was not "a more." So Calamity was worn .out
by failing to bring the "more" and the "fittener" together
in one bill, and his people kept him at home to rest.
We fear it will be J so with Mr. Hearst.

The offer of Mayor Schmitz 'to act

to either side. Minor difficulties might

main question of unionism was in

called upon to perform in the face of
the impending trouble, he would devote
his full time to his intercession work.

Silence was the watchword yesterday
In regard to th<* differences existing be
tween the carmen and the United
Railroads. Neither side had anything
definite to give to the public regarding
the situation. At the company's head
quarters it was stated that no change
in the -ituation had occurred so far as
the officials knew. Mayor Schmitz had
no positive information to give regard
ing, the result of the afternoon and
evening conferences he held with Ar
thur Holland, president of the United
Railroads. j So far as he knew, he said,
no basis of settlement had been
reached.
The officials of the union professed
to know nothing that had been done to
heal the existing rupture between the
United Railroads and its employes.
Officials of the company declared that
no effectual compromise of the troubles
had been adjusted. . â¢
Only one official statement was as
sued during the day, and that came
from the carmen's union. Between the
pauses and in the spaces of their plaint
it is evident that the employes have
no hope for peace. A mass meeting has
been called at midnight to-night of the
members of the union, at which time
the question of "strike" will again be
submitted to them. On their decision
will result the question whether or not
they will quit their present employ

STATEMENT OP CARMEN*.
Cases of Persons Said to Have
Been Implicated in the
Land Frauds Continued
When the conference broke up be
tween Mayor Schmitz and President
Holland it was close to midnight. The
place of meeting was kept a secret, and
all the Mayor would say was that it
had been held on neutral ground. It
was understood that the Mayor and the
officials of the United Railroads met in
the Palace Hotel, in apartments spe
cially reserved for the occasion. The
Mayor was delegated to give out what
ever information he thought fit.
Generally he was optimistic over the
situation and seemed to think that
there was a possibility of settlement
without the dread arbitrament of a
strike. He gave no details of the terms
upon which he based his hope of pre
venting the carmen from going out.
When' he was asked the question as to
whether any method had been arrived
at regarding the question of unionism,
he laughed and said he was pledged to
secrecy in all of the proceedings of the
conference. To-day, he said, the con
ference would be resumed, and perhaps
a more detailed statement could then
be made regarding its proceedings. I
The conference between the Mayor
and the officials of the company was
continued last night. None of the union
officials was called in and the only hint
any of them had of the proceedings
was the brief telephonic communica
tion from the Mayor. President Mahon
had absolutely nothing to give out per
sonally.
"The men decided to postpone action
upon the strike question," he said, "in
deference to the request of the Mayor
of San Francisco. The time limit will
expire at midnight to-morrow. I have
had no information from the Mayor
since the meeting Sunday morning un
til 6 o'clock to-night, when, he told me
that he was In conference with the of
ficials of the railway company and
hoped to arrive at some agreement
with them that would be acceptable to
members of our organization. I hope
he will be able to do so, as every single
man connected with our organization
Is anxious on behalf of himself and the
public to avoid any trouble."
SCHMITZ IS IIOPEFUIi. i
Schmltz gave Mah:n the assuran:e
that a possible settlement might bis ar
ranged.
_/'On what basis?" asked Mahon.
Evidently the reply was not pleasing
to the international president.
"We can't stand that," he said.
land of the United Railroads for a
meeting between himself and the Mayor
of San Francisco. It was not' sought ton
the. part of the company. Shortly af
ter 3 o'clock ; in the afternoon Mayor
Schmitz walked unattended into the Ri
alto building and was elevated to the
eighth floor, where the company's of
fices are located. He stood in the corri
dor for a moment until he located a door
with the sign of "General Manager's
Office" and to this he went. As soon
as.he.go.t inside the clerks recognized
him and by devious ways he was led
to a room where President Holland was
awaiting him. .
The two went into conference at once
and discussed the situation for more
than two hours and a half. Then the
Mayor left, going at once to his office.
After 6 o'clock he called up the head
quarters of the Carmen's Union and
inquired for International President
Mahon. The latter had been at the
headquarters all day waiting anx
iously for some message from tin
Mayor. , . , .
Meyers and the eirl were emerging
from an Ellis-street lodging-house
when Mrs. Warner saw, them, and
It is doubtful, after all, that Alice
Warner will become Mrs. M. H. Mey
ers, whom her mother had arrested
and charged with battery before Judge
Fritz. The girl was In court yesterday
and denied improper relationship with
the defendant, and Mrs. Warner stated
that she -did not thinK the proposed
marriage would be a wise thing, be
cause she entertained misgivings as
to Meyers' ability or willingness to
support a wife. Then the case was
continued until the young woman's
father is heard from.
Jesus Navarro pulled the proverbial
"ugly-lnoking knife" and threatened
to carve a gentleman who accidental
ly jostled him Saturday night on Grant
avenue, and Judge Mogan will hear the
testimony to-morrow.

tion, scheduled to consume six weeks.
Judge Conlan cleaned off his calendar.
In the purging process H. G. Schu
macher, charged with embezzling
precious stones valued at J6 95 from
W. J. Hesthal, a Sixth-street jeweler,
was held to answer in the Superior
Court, with bail fixed at $2000. Once
upon a time Schumacher owned a Jew
elry store in the Palace Hotel block
and failed for $80,000.
Edward Davis of 81 Natoma street
informed Judge Fritz that he had been
held up and robbed of $14 S5 by "James
Kelly, the two Flynns and a Swede,"
and his Honor continued the case of
Kelly, the only member of the quintet
who was arrested, until the other per
sons accused can be rounded-up and
taken to court.
The accuser and the accused had
been drinking together at the former's
expense, until he got tired of monopo
lizing the outlay and decided to go
home. Kelly, the two Flynns and the
Swede asked him to give them 20 cents
apiece before leaving them, and in or
der to comply with the request he was
obliged to obtain change for a $5 gold
piece. The sight of so much money apv
parently excited their cupidity, for after
getting two bits apiece they followed
him. he said, and Kelly forcibly dispos
sessed him of the 514 85.
"Tut, tut," said Judge Mogan; "the
Barbary Coast is not a bit less re
spectable than the Bowery after dark,
and I'm sure you would never think of
freighting yourself with a revolver
while visiting the-Bowery. Take back
your gun and leave it in your trunk
until you enter the country of cow
boys and Indians."
The defendant pleaded that he car
ried the gun because he had been in
formed before he left New York that
it would be extremely dangerous to
venture abroad in San Francisco with
out having a shooting-iron within con
venient reach.
1'ied Jackson, a tourist from Gotham,
was inspecting the Barbary Coast last
Saturday evening, when Patrolman

"Thinking ain't no law," replied Mary,
whose repeated poslngs as a defendant
have not been entirely uninstructive to
herself. "Only what we know is law;

"You work even* one you can," re
marked his Honor, "and I'll give you
thirty days in jail to think up some
mote law."
"No, I don't want no lawyer," said
Mary Fisher, middle-aged and slovenly,
to Judge Fritz; "I'll plead not guilty
an* waive a Jury. Now go ahead and
prove me a vag."
"What do you think you are?" In
quired the court.

u-say the least, when he arrested

"â¢her there,. but was dissatisfied vrith the

Ing spent in conference he made

by Mr. Holland. I am not able
to state what these are to-night,
but they will be transmitted to
the carmen to-morrow and may
be a solution of the difficulty.
A ' further conference will be

NEW YORK, May 2.â For an off day
the card at Jamaica to-day was an at
tractive one and the racing was wit
nessed by a good-sized crowd. Ostrich,
second choice in the betting and nicely
ridden by Fuller, won from James R.
Keene's lightweighted gelding Careless
at 12 to 1. Fuller was compelled to
ride his best to stall off the rush of
Burns on Keene's horse by the shortest
of heads.
- Aside from this race the feature was
the poor showing made by Grand Opera
in, the second event. He was never
prominent at any stage and failed to
show a trace of his former great speed.
Lord of the Valley won this event, lead-
Ing from start to finish.
It was a bad day for favorites, as
only two, First Born and Kohlnoor,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Martin Canole, the premier light
weight of Boston, arrived here
last night fresh from the Hub city.
Canole Is scheduled to box Â¦?'Battling"
Nelson twenty rounds on the night of
May 20 under the auspices of the San
Francisco Club. The Boston boy looks
fit and ready and - in his own quiet
way he says he will put up a fight
that Is sure to make the local sports
happy.
Canole Is the little boxer who fought
that wonderful twenty-five-round bat
tle with Jimmy Britt at Colma last
November. The memory of that con
flict is still fresh in the mind of every
man who witnessed it. Canole is a
great favorite with the followers of the
fistic game in this city and he was
given quite a welcome on his arrival.
The Boston boy is accompanied by
his manager, James Connolly. The lat
ter thinks his man will compel Nelson
to seek the floor after a few rounds and
he brings a whole lot of money wjth
which to back up his assertions, j ..
'T have been doing a lot of boxing
lately," said Canole, "and in the last
few months I have met and. beaten five
of the best men in the East. Should
I win from Nelson I will return imme
diately to Boston where I expect to
box Joe Gans at 133 pounds *at 3 o'clock.
I think I will train at Blanken's for
the coming fight. Jack "Welch, Eddie
Graney or any good man will suit me
as a referee, as I have no choice."

CHICAGO. May_2.â Jack Root of
Chicago was given the decision " over

for 'recognition, while San Antonio,
Tex., will point to her Lone Star em
blem and ask the convention to decide
to go there next year. Â»
Election of officers occurs Thursday
afternoon. It is generally understood
that A. W. Farlinger of Atlanta, Ga.,
who is vice president of the national
association, will be elected to the presi
dency. F. M. Newland, who has been
treasurer of the association for several
years, will no doubt be re-elected. The
executive committee will be elected at
the same time, but the members for
nomination have not yet been sug
gested.
The refusal of the convention to al
low Elisha Winters of Kansas City a
seat as a delegate is heartily indorsed
by the delegates. Winters represents
a collecting agency and a system which
the grocers contend is detrimental to
their efforts for securing garnishment
legislation.
The convention has a number of
orators among its delegates and there
are no cries of "Louder" when Delegate
Sullivan of Missouri takes the floor or
when Delegate Gray of New York
starts to speak.

CRACK SPRINTERS MEET
AT OAKLAND TRACK TO-DAY
The University of California added
another victory to her long list yes
terday afternoon when her crew of
stalwart oarsmen walked away from
the seasoned varsity crew from Wash
ington.
The race, which was pulled over a
mile and a half straightaway course,
was scheduled to take place at 3:30
o'clock sharp, but lqng before that time
barges and launches, loaded with yell
ing rooters, sped noisily up and down
the stream, while horns, .whistles and
college yells sang through the rigging
of neighboring vessels.
Fair co-eds, waving blue and gold
flags, and tanned athletes thronged the
piers along the water's edge, and it was
evident that the victory, of last Satur
day inspired them with a confidence of
their team's ability to hold its own.
It was 4:32 when the sharp crack of
a pistol set the two sturdy crews tug
ging at their oars. The shells simul
taneously shot ahead, but the strong
tide that discouraglngly swept down
on the raceboats impeded their speed
materially.
After the first^couple of strokes the
California boat crept ahead. Its crew
swung a short, quick stroke, while the
men in the Washington boat settled
down to a long, sweeping one. For the
first minute of the race the California
crew pulled forty-two strokes while
their opponents pulled but thirty-one.
It did not take but a moment to see
that the California boat was to be the
winner of the day. Her crew slackened
up its pace until it regulated a steady
thirty-four stroke. Her opponents
slowed down to- twenty-seven.
When, the boats passed by the coal
barges, a Quarter of a mile from the
starting point, California's boat was
half a length ahead, and by the time
Lake Merritt was reached had doubled
her lead. The California boat finally
reached the goal 34 seconds ahead ot
the visitors. Time for the winners,
13 minutes and 43 seconds. Washington
University, 11 minutes and 19 seconds.
. A mighty roar went up as the win
ning crejy tossed their oars. They had
started a fast stroke and had retained
it throughout the race. They had won
the race, but their sinewy arms and
shoulders were tired and aching from
their exertions.
As the Washington i boat passed
alongside of the three-masted bark Two
Brothers that was anchored, in the
stream her captain, a weather-beaten
old sailor, leaned over the bulwarks
and waved his cap. "You're all right,
boys; you may be beat, but you've got
mere of a seamanlike stroke than them
other fellers."
Knight, coach for the Washington
crew, said after the race was over that
he appreciated the sportsmanlike man
ner in which his team has been received
here and hopes that it will not be long
before the crews try for honors again.
The crews were as follows:
California. Position. Washington.
Grindley Bow Van Kuran
Anloff Second bow Pullen
Bannister Second stroke Lantz
Bunnell Stroke . ., McElmon
Loeb (120 lbs)... Coxswain King (168 lbs)

Jud Smith broke up a great game
â¢ jesterday afternoon when he lined the
leather to the flagpole and put Uncle's
commissioners out of the running. It
' took ten innings to turn the trick and
' It so happened that the game was the
first extra Inning affair that has been
pulled off at the Eighth street lot th's
season. Score: Los Angeles 2, San
. Francisco 1.
Not a man on either side seemed able
to hit the ball to any extent, although
â¢â¢Dolly" Gray came through with a
Â¦wallop over the center-field fence in the
third inning and gave the Angels their ;
lead, which they held with safety till
the fifth.
Then the native tossers began to
ginger up some. Miller bunted a nice
. one down the first base line which
: Gray threw over the first baseman's
'- hÂ« <id and Miller trotted down to sec
â¢ ond. Knell fanned the wind, but Hil
â¢ d-.brand worked "Dolly for a base.
WaWron responded with a drive to left
Â«â¢" and the bases were all .occupied.
Meany tore one in the direction of
Chase and the youngster picked up the
ball and threw it perfectly to the plate.
' Eagar was even more eager than his
name implies and in his effort to make
a double play he dropped the ball and
â¢â¢ Miller registered. It looked good for
a whole lot more, but Irwin popped up
a little fiy to Toman and Hildebraud
was nailed at the plate in an endeavor
to beat the throw in.
. After that inning Gray had his left
tvinsr working right and no one seemed
lei be able to approach within hitting
diPtanoe of his shoots. Knoll was also
t'r.cre a few and held the Angels safe.
With one down in the tenth Flood
fmashed one out squarely to left ficÂ»d
and lost no time in stealing the second
cushion. Smith at this juncture hap
pened along with his drive to the flag
pole and even the shouting was over

CONVENTION SIDELIGHTS.
Names of Some of the Delegates That
Will Be Placed In Office.
The popularity of Secretary Fred
Mason practically settles the question
as to who will be elected to fill that
important position. The delegates are
virtually a unit on the subject of his
re-election.
Niagara Falls will very likely be
selected as the meeting place for the
convention of 1905, for it has a strong
following, which will picture its beau
ties in such glowing terms that the
delegates will . line up for it with suf
ficient votes to give it the eighth an
nual gathering:. There will be other
cities put forward, but from present
indications they will be among the
"also-ran" class. Cincinnati will make
a plea. Little Rock, Ark., will also ask

The field charged iinto the stretch
with Elwood and Brancas almost neck
and neck and Ed Tierney about a half
length away. f Out from the bunch
moved Elwood and Ed Tierney, each
with plenty of speed in reserve, and
from the three-sixteenths pole it was a
duel to the wire, with Elwood first and
Ed Tierney's nose hanging at his
flank. Brancas was only a length
back. Silverwings finished six lengths
behind the winner and three lengths
in front of Proceeds. Results:
LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 2.â After a
winter of rest Elwood, C. C. Durnell's
bay colt, came across the continent
and to-day took the most hotly con
tested Kentucky Derby since the fa
mous duel between Proctor Knott and
Spokane. The winner Avas the -longest
priced horse in the race, and the Ten
nessee and Blue Grass contingent
"went broke." Ed Tierney was second
and Brancas third. Time, 2:08 1 / Â£.
The track was two seconds slow.
Proceeds was the favorite at evens.
Brancas was second choice at 2, Ed
Tierney at 4 and Prince Silverwings
and Elwood at 6 and 10 to 1, respect
ively.
Proceeds took the lead and began to
cut out the pace, with Prince Silver
wings crowding him, and Brancas
third. Ed Tierney and Elwood were
close up. This order was maintained
until the half was reached, where Pro
ceeds had increased his lead to near
ly three lengths. Immediately the fa
vorite began to drop back and Silver
wings moved to the front, Proceeds be
ing drawn into a duel with the Prince,
which lasted to the seven-furlong pole.
The pace slackened, Proceeds begin
ning to tire. Prince Silverwings also
was tiring, and the pair began to slip
back almost at the same instant. When
the mile post was reached Brancas
forged to the front, and Elwood and
Ed Tierney were beginning to
move up.

Herschel Mayall was given a de

Theater. His double impersonation of
"Dr. Jekyll, and Mr. Hyde" was un
doubtedly the most convincing work
done by that able actor during his
Central engagement. His transform-
It Is a pleasure to witness the pro
duction of Arthur W. Pinero'8 "The
Profligate" by the Alcazar's excellent
company. x The play was produced at
the Alcazar for the first time last
night, without a hitch or &' blemish.
The company was admirably fitted to
the characters, and the scenery, espe
cially the loggia of the Villa Coloblano,
was applauded most deservedly. To
add to the effect S. Homer Henley
behind the scenes sang Angelo Masch
eroni's "Glamour" in amorous ac
cents, while hearts were breaking on
the stage and eyes were moist in the
auditorium.
This is a play in which the women
of the cast must shine most luminous
ly or else there must come failure and
disappointment, and the women do
shine â all of them together, Juliet
Crosby and Adele Block being twin
stars of the brightest. Miss Block is
the happy, unsuspecting, bride and the
tragedy and the tears follow swiftly
upon the heels of the smiling honey
moon. There is a betrayed girl among
the central figures, who is personated
by Frances Starr, and, to her credit be

ing. Marie Howe, the scheming
mamma, Is in her best form in the
character of Mrs. Stonehay. James
Durkin, the profligate Dunstan Ren
shaw, with a shady past, is most ef
fective. Harry Hilltard, the Juvenile;
George Osbourne, the ancient, and
John B. Maher, the burlesque noble
man, fill in the odd corners of the play
most effectively.
Alcazar.
Melbourne MacDowell begran an en
gagement last nigrht at the Grand
Opera-house in a hig-hly creditable pro
duction of Sardou's "La Tosca," which
scored a triumph. MacDowell enacts
the difficult part of Baron Scarpia, In
which he is perfectly at home and
shows the finished actor that he is.
MacDowell plays with a subtle knowl
edge of the actor's art in its smallest
detail, and has surrounded himself with
capable support. Miss Ethel Fuller was
fully equal to the role of Floria^Tosca,
which enabled her to give full play to
her emotional talents. Her scene with
Scarpia In which she finally 'kills the
destroyer of her lover works the spec
tators up to a high pitch of excitement
and earned several curtain calls, which
were profuse throughout the entire per
formance. Robert Elliot gave a virile
Impersonation of Mario, and his love
making with Tosca was a pleasant fea
ture of the piece. The scene where
Mario is tortured by Scarpia to divulge
the hiding place of Angelottl was well
done, and Miss Fuller did some admir
able acting in her endeavor to with
stand the determined efforts of Scarpia
to compel her to betray her lover's
friend. Angelottl was acted intelligent
ly by Jack Webster, and Edmund Quil
linan showed good dramatic training
in the part of Schlarone. Miss Pauline
Willard made a graceful queen and
Miss Nettie Black was acceptable as
Princess Orlonla.

around and about at will in the still

He then decided to start for San

from one of the propeller shafts and
this compelled him to cut his trip

a landing, which was effected without

"N* York" is stamped all over the
production of "The Rogers Brothers in
London," given last night at the Colum
bia by the original Gus and Max. We
have had "others. They did not remind
of Broadway. One would have hesi- <
tated to saddle even Milpltas with some |
of the Raymond and Caverly Rogers ;
Brothers stuff that descended upon us i
last season at the Grand Opera-house. |
To say that the R. B.'s have been I
robustly libeled by their local substl--,
tutes is to put the case mildly. It is {
the difference between chalk and ,
cheese, water and wine. It is all !
through the productitm, from come
dians to chorus. As a girl show "The Â¦
Rogers Brothers in London" could not i
be bettered. N'or as a gown show. Its \
comedians, though fewer than . with j
the Weberfieldiane, are of the best. \
There are good voices and good stuff ,
for them to sing. The piece itself is {
one sparkle. The Rogers Brothers are |
not in London for nothing. There is [
the English flavor about the piece, bits ;
of quaint, local colorâ Mr. Coyne is a'!
positively fascinating example. There
are good specialties, the scenes â on
shipboard, in Trafalgar Square, Lon- i
don, and in Slegrel-Coopers, New York â j
are stunningly put forth and the per
formance goes with a snap irresistible.
One has the new thing In Gus and
Max Rorers. They are German com- 1
edians who neither strangle with their \
accent nor depend upon swats on the j
solar plexus. John McNally, who is :
the author of their piece, has furnished ,
them with some brilliantly lively lines,
and they get every ounce coming out
of them. They both singâ Max might
ily, and dance with uproarious com
icality. They. could not be better and
their support is almost as good. Joseph
Coyne, as the lisping Englishman, la
delightful. Lillian Coleman, well
known here for her work at Fischers I
In its earlier days, comes back prettier j
and more vocally tuneful than ever, j
She has' a song that stays in "By the ;
Sycamore Tree," suns with Mr. Moore. \
Neva Aymar is handsome and sufiicient !
to her part and Carrie Reynolds fills In j
usefully. Very funny, too, Is the show I
girl of Melville Ellis. : Â» : ' :
The piece, in short, is perfect of pro
duction, full of fun never-ceasing. It
was enjoyed by an audience as largo
as the house.

ation scenes were remarkable, not only
for the lightning changes from Jekyll
to Hyde and vice ver8a, but for the
completeness of the metamorphosis,
making -Hyde~ the hideous, uncanny
antithesis to the- lovable and attrac
tive Jekyll; and his acting exhibited a
fine repression in Jekyll and a chilling
and terrifying power in Hyde. It was
distinctively a Mayall night at the
Central,' and. a dozen thunderous
curtain calls, not to mention
numerous floral ,Â¦ : pieces, were en
thusiastic acknowledgments of a
worthy artistic achievement. May
all's "Dr. . Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is an
Intense study in strong contrasts, and
Is. both fearsome and fascinating. The

THE - FUTURE REVEALED, THE PAST
DISCLOSED.
The Present Analyzed by Livingstone.
PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living pagi of, Flammarlon's treatise that Is
so electrifying the world to-day. He is no
imitator. His work is upon original lines,
pure thought. -clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to know and works In the open
light.
He is as conspicuous for his wonderful occult
analysis as he is for bis original expression
and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
is of little value; when the mind is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.
This 'la just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
gives you when you call on him for a first-
class, clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does' not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let PROF. LIV-
INGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you. find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

. The China encountered strong head
winds nearly all the way across tho
Pacific. Her passenger list included
the following named:
Among the passengers were a number
of Chinese and Japanese officials to the
St. Louis Exposition. Mrs. J. F. Smith,
wife of the former commanding offi
cer of the First California Volunteers,
returned on the liner from Manila.
The Pacific Mail Company's liner
China arrived yesterday afternoon
from the Orient with 719 passengers, of
whom 486 were Asiatics, and 1774 tons
of freight. The cargo, although small,
is intrinsically of great value. It in
cludes 1300 bales of raw silk and 239
packages of silk goods, the total silk
having a market value of more than
$1,000,000. In the treasure room is a
big shipment of Japanese gold yen
worth* $3,344,350 in United States gold
coin. In addition to Ihe silk and treas
ure the China's cargo included: 1500
bales of jute from Calcutta; 284 bales
of skins from Shanghai; 766 slabs of
tin; 407 teak planks for the Union Iron
Works, and 250 packages of spices, con
sisting chiefly of pepper and nutmegs.
Among the passengers was Mrs. Ice
land Stanford, who has been making
a tour of the Far East, and Bernard
Faymonvillc, vice president of the Fire
man's Fund Insurance Company. He
has been in the Orient looking over the
insurance field and has established
agencies of his company at Manila,
Hongkong and Shanghai. He decided
to let Japan go for the present as the
fee demanded by the Mikado's Govern
ment seemed out of proportion to the
business probabilities. Mr. Faymon
ville returns a great admirer of the
Mikado's people, however, and for
nothing does he like them better than
their Intense loyalty to their island
kingdom. He visited Tokio and cheer
ed ud the war correspondents who
were growing very impatient at the ob
stacles politely placed in the way of
their going to the front.
Captain J. H. Russell of the United
States Marine Corps and Lieutenant
Commander G. W. McElroy were also
passengers on the China. They nave

The alleged niggardliness and penuri
ousness of John R. Fritz Js the cause
of the suit for divorce filed against
him yesterday by Emelie Fritz.
Mrs. Fritz avers that though her
husband has an income of from J1S0
to $200 a month, he alfows her but $4
a month for pin money and then bor
rows part of it back and refuses to
pay her. She says, also, that he com
pels her to pay him 25 cents a week
for the use of a sewing machine he re
cently bought on a speculation, and
that for two years be compelled her
to live In a hut on Clyde street that
was unfit for habitation.
It is further averred in Mrs. Fritz s
complaint that Fritz has. a habit of
almost daily calling her all sorts of vile
names, and that he has a certain
woman ccme to the Fritz home that
he. may indulge in tete-a-tetes with
her. Mrs. Fritz says she suffers great
mental agony because of her husbands
conduct %vith this woman, particularly
when they sit in the chimney corner
and smoke corncob pipes together.
Joseph P. Corcoran is the defendant
In the divorce a/tion brought by Ethel
R. Corcoran. They were married but
little more than a year ago. and Mr3.
Corcoran alleges that she has been un
happy ever since because Corcoran al
lows his father to remain at their homÂ«
and act the part of a dictator. The
Corcorans live at 1119Â»5 Folsom street.
The husband is a telegraph operator
in the employ of the Western Union.
Joseph EL King wants a divorce from
Anna J. King on the ground of intem
perance. ~ , I
Dr. Bruce D. Kimmis, the proprietor
of the Indian drug store, who ia beins
sued for divorce by Etta Lulu Kimmis
on the ground of cruelty, answered hi*
wife's suit yesterday with a genera!
denial fit her charges of cruelty, and
in a cross-complaint accuses her of
being intemperate. :>-Â»4; :.^r
William J. Smith does not relish the
idea of resting under the charge of bat
ing a cruel husband. In an answer
and cross-complaint to the suit for di
vorce of L.uella Olive Smith he sayÂ»
he has always been a good, true and
dutiful husband, and that his wife has
been anything but a fond and loving
wife. He says she is too fond of going
to Sunday picnics to suit him. The
Smiths formerly conducted a rooming
house at 3V^ Larkin street.
The Lovells, Charles and Agnes, do
not think alike on the question of in
temperance. In Lovell's divorce com
plaint he charges that his wife is too
fond of liquor, and in her cross-com
plaint she charges that Lovell is the
one who overindulges.
Judge Hebbard yesterday made an
order purging of contempt Allan O.
Eddy, the Southern Pacific engineer
who last Friday was adjudged guilty
of contempt of court for failing to pay
his wife $70 back alimony. The en
gineer furnished evidence that his
failure to appear and show caus-s
why he had not paid the money was
due to excusable neglect.
Divorces were granted to Raymond
F. Knick from Marie Knick for cruelty,
Mrs. Knick having written him a let
ter telling him that she hated the sight
of him: Lucy Selore from Carlo Selore
for cruelty and Ida Hoppe from Ed
win A. Hoppe for neglect. #
Suits for divorce were filed by Cath
erine A. Baine against Patrick J.
Balne for neglect and Linnle Schreck
against Jchn F. Schreck for cruelty.
Judge Kerrigan heard the suit for
divorce of Edith Olsen against G. Ol
gen, but refused to grant a decree be
cause she did not prove her charge of
cruelty. He put the matter over to en
able her to furnish further evidence.

CHICAGO. May 2. â In response to a fair de
mand from short* . the wheat market opened
about steady, with July unchanged to V4c
lower at S3UÂ©85^ic. Soon afterward, how
ever, report* of excellent weather throughout
the greater part of: the country created a
bearUh sentiment. In consequence July sold
to W?4c and then started a downward course.
There was a general commission house selling.
Many Â«top-loÂ«Â» orders came out on the way
down. NewÂ« from the Northwest was extremely
bearish. One report stated that all mills at
Minneapolis would close down Wednesday on
account of a tack of demand for- flour. Al
though the . wheat market here received fair
support at times, liquidation was so liberal
that prices continued the decline throughout
thÂ« session. The close Â»Â¦Â« weak, with July
at 84%c.
Decreased receipts, wlih a small percentage
of contract grain, held the_corn market firm
early in the day In spite of weakness In
wheat The close was weak, with July at
47%@48c.
Weakness ia wheat deliveries and favorabls
weather were influence* that brought out lib
eral liquidation ot July oats. July clWeU
at SS%c.
In (ace of weakness* In grains and lower
prices for hogs, provisions closed firm at a
slight advance In all products. A fair de
mand from pit traders for ribs wag the cause
ot lhe late firmness, the market cuIIur easy
In sympathy with grains. July pork closed
7"c up, lard 5c higher and ribs 5c advanced.

the general assurances offered by these agents
that Â« very pn-caution has been taken to guard
aÂ£:uni-l disturbance of ihe money market doea
not â¢aUreljr accumpllsh its purpose. li*j is
realized that the devices of the French syndi
cate whK-h advanced tho purchase prlc* tt>
the oanal stockholders and ihe co-operattiJn
with New York bankers are designed to miti
gate and distribute tfte effect of_ the ' large
trantvacticn. but nothing has been' off<ved ' to
indicate that the ultimate result* to -the N?w
York banking- reserves will be altered- by
these devices. 'The additional tail! by.- "the
treasury ispon Government depositories makes
it evident bIm that Che full amount uf ilif
l'anama purchase will be withdrawn from |
Uovernmi-nt deposits with banks. The effect
was seen in Lhe cwlining of the bonds to-day.
How far this condition may induce the banks
tÂ«i take Â«>ut additional circulation It a ques
tion of interest. It Is felt that the outcome of â¢
these various factors may account in no small
pan for the halt ' in, the stcck market. To
day't market missed the sustaining effect of
the recent advancing tendency In London,
wlicre the Exchange was closed for a holiday,
while the more Indirect effect of the Parts
market was depressing, owing to the Russian
revert* on the Ya!u. The weekly returns
ebowed no decisive improvement in the rail
road traffic situation, and the net earnings
for March reported continue the poor com
parison with last year.
Expressed opinions by trade authorities that
urgent European demand for copper was prob
ably, satisfied, resulted in the prompt selling
of Amalgamated Copper. The money market
was unaffected by the additional gold engage
ments. The closing tone of the market was
easy and prices were generally near the low

Eggs ruled firm, though there waa no scar
city. Buying for storage continues on a lib
era 1 scale, but some local houses hope that a
further advance in quotations will shut It off
and thus check the upward movement, which
they consider fictitious at this time of the year,
and likely to be followed by a depressed mar
ket later on.
Receipts were 80.100 lbs Butter, 1462 cases

In spite of continued large receipts the feel-
Ing in Butter was reported steadier yesterday
without any change in prices. The steadiness
was attributed to some packing- orders on the
market, but the average dealer, with his
eye on that l.OitO.000 pounds in storage left
over from last year, dties not feel much like
rushing into the storage and packing business
on hta own account to any great extant.
The situation In Cheeese was unchanged.
Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Poultry opened J the week easy and at the
end of the day there was a considerable quanÂ»
tity of undesirable stock lying around unsold.
Nearly all of the. ear of Western Hens that
came In last Friday was still on hand and
another car was placeX on the market. | Re,
celvers of Wtutern were-Mibliged (o cut prices
in order to effect saUs and the stock was
offered at $7@7 50 per dozen and moved rather
froely at those figures. TherÂ«; was not enough
doing in domestic Poultry to warrant any
change in the quotations, but the general
feeling was* weak, with dealers making con
cessions In order to clean up. Game* was in
light receipt and cleaned up quickly -at the
previous prices.

The Rev. David J. Evans, the rector,
in addressing the meeting expressed
himself as being thoroughly at home
in the auxiliary.
There was an -'exceptionally large
gathering of the ladies, of Grace
Church and many were present Â¦ from
the bay cities.
The auxiliary received good news
from the Rev. John Chapman of the
Anvlk (Alaska) Mission, who reported
that the Indians have driven out the
Shamans and have made a request for
a white physician.
Another item of : most . satisfactory
news received, was the announcement
that Bishop Rowe has arrived in Cali

of unknown territory in Alaska.
Bishop Rowe Was at one time, three
days without food and. to add to the

HOUSE.,' OF' BISHOPS ADJOURXS.
Distinguished Prelates Express De
light With San Francisco.
The House of Bishops of the Meth
odist Episcopal Church met for the
last time in the city. yesterday morn
ing and adjourned about noon. In
the evening the/, distinguished body
departed on a special train to attend 1
the General Conference at Los An
geles. '
Before adjourning the house passed
a resolution thanking the committee
of arrangements for the perfect man
ner in which everything tending to the
comfort of the Bishops was consid
ered. '
The Bishops passed a resolution ex
pressing their deep appreciation of
the. attention they had received at the
hands of the manager of the Occiden
tal Hotel.
Regarding the convention Bishop
Goodsell said:
"We feel that never have we been
more carefully provided for or more
genially or thoroughly j entertained.
We have, " indeed, been almost ' embar
rassed, with the hospitality, and only
through lack of time have we had to
decline, most regretfully, an invitation
to Mare Island and also to dine with
some of the officers at the Presidio."
During the afternoon several of the
Bishops paid a visit to Palo Al(,o and
some went to San Jose, where last
nightthey joined the special from San
Francisco. ,.â¢Â¦.â¢â¢ . ,
Bishop Moore; arrived, from China
on the steamship China and will leave
for Los Angeles to-day.
i Bishop Fowler has been invited and
has accepted an invitation to preach
the baccalaureate sermon at the Uni
versity of California May 10, and
Bishop Goodsell will preach the
baccalaureate at Stanford University
the same date. .
There is more ' than a likelihood
that among the new Bishops to be ap~
pointed at the General , Conference
will be Dr. Stuntz of the Philippines.
The doctor, who â¢ has. seen many
years' service as . a " missionary, has
won the highest admiration of his
coworkers on the mission field and
also the psteem of the missionary
board of America.
"Manila should be a free port. The
United States consular service in the
Far East is a disgrace to the republic.
The average representative of this
Government in the Orient is an ill
informed. Incapable -grafter, a detri
ment to American progress in that part
of the world and a living blot upon
American prestige among the nations
of the world. I make this statement
advisedly and my signature goes with
it if you want it."
AV. M. Castle of the firm of Castle
Brothers of this city returned from the
Orient yesterday, a passenger, with
hi3 wife, on the liner China. Having
extensive business relations throughout
the Far East and being a frequent
visitor to that part of the world, Mr.
Castle's opinions on trans-Pacific sub
jects are" entitled to respect and he
voiced them yesterday in no uncertain
key. He has radical idea's concerning
the Philippines and no use for the
American Consul in the Orient, as may
be gathered from the opening quota
tions from his opinions as expressed
yesterday on the China's deck. Con
all the States in Union and an ad-
The Government needs nothing more than a
training school for ) the consular service and
the placing of Consuls under civil service regu
lations. We have some good Consuls In the
Orient, and none of them ever Jhade me con
tribute any side money to thelr'prosperlty. I
am known there, however, and, good or bad,
they all know that I could make things hot
for the Consul that gave me anything but a
square deal. I>t the average traveler In the
Far East go to the American Consul for as
sistance, for advice, for anything, even mall,
and In nine cases out of ten the consular
hand* will be stretched forth to. catch what
may come in response to the Intimation that
"the Consul 'la not out., here for his health."
The result Is that -rAmericans that know | the
ropes go to any Consul but their own for ad
vice or. information and keep their troubles
to themselves. . - Â¦ .^ Â¦ â¢ Â¦
Speaking of the Philippines Mr. Cas
tle declares the new possessions. In
his'opinlon, of great intrinsic value. He
said: ...
Both civil and military arovernments have
done solendld - work ' there, and In this I con
nection I want to pay a tribute to Archbishop
Harty of "the Catholic church. There ia an
American for you. All by himself he is doing
as much to popularize American rule as any
branch of the government. The United
States owes Harty a biff. debt.
Manila, in my opinion, should, be a' free
port, like Hongkong. I am a good Republican
and I know this Is against tradition. So was
expansion. We expanded, and it Is up to us
now to do everything we can to make expan
sion a , success. The labor j question in â¢ the
Philippines must be - settled. If the. Filipino
will work, I say by. all means keep out the
Chinese. The wage for unskilled labor Is now
$1 a day. This will keep a Filipino a week.
He will â¢ not "work while he has money. We
must cither, break up this habit .i which Is bred
In the bone, cut his pay to 1<K cents a day.

George Walker, After More
Than Six Tears in the
o County Jail, Is Discharged
George Walker, after being confined
in the County Jail for more than six
years waiting the final disposition of
his case, was discharged from custody
yesterday. The case was called in
Judge Dunne's court and was dismissed
on motion of the District Attorney.
The situation assumed more than or
dinary importance from the determined
fight made by Attorney George D. Col
lins to save Walker from being sent to
State's prison and losing his franchise.
Walker was employed as a solicitor
by the American Tract Society, an<l
was arrested in 1897 on four charge
of felony embezzlement. He was held
to answer and the cases were assigned
to Judge Dunne's court. He was trieJ
on one of the charges of embezzling
$S2 35 and was convicted on January
11, 1S9S. A month later he was sen
tenced to serve four years In Folaom
penitentiary.
His attorney took an appeal to the
Supreme Court, and meantime, on Jan
uary 4, 1900, the other three chaiges
against him were dismissed on motion
of the District Attorney. He was grant
ed a new trial by the Supreme Court.
At his second trial he was convicted,
and on August 26, 1901, was sentenced
to serve one year in San Quentin.
An appeal to the Supreme Court was
again taken and a new trial was grant
ed last February. Since the flist trl il
three of the most important witnesses
have died, and the fact that Walksr
had already spent more than six yean
In the County Jail and his last sen
tence was only one year lod the Dis
trict Attorney to move for a dismissal
of the case, thereby saving the expense
of another trial.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
decided yesterday to begin considera
tion of the municipal budget for 1904-5
to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock. The
requested appropriations of the County
Clerk, Assessor, Recorder, Tax Collect
or and Sheriff will be taken up and
the . heads of the five offices will be
present to explain their needs to the
committee, which will formulate its
recommendations to the board.
The board, received notification from
the Sacramento Chamber of Commerce

At the Baptist Ministers' Association
yesterday the Rev. A. S. Coatts of
Berkeley, formerly of the Rochester,
N. Y.. Baptist Seminary, read a paper
on "The Omissions in the Ethical
Teachings of Jesus."
In explaining his" subject he said
Jesus did not refer, to filial devotion or
to trusts or monopolieJ^nor talk about
intemperance. These sobjects. said the
speaker, were all met in the Old Testa
ment, and where Christ did not abro
gate any of the teachings of the Old
Testament they remain intact.
The reverend gentleman dwelt on .the
fatherhood of God, saying that it was
only extended to his spiritual children,
and not to mankind in general.
Many of those present differed with
the, views presented by the Rev. Mr.
Coatts. . . .

circles.
Dr. A. B. Leonard, secretary of the

one of the speakers at the meeting, and
told that the increase over the amount
reported at the last quadrennial meet
ing amounts to $633,027 60 for foreign
mission work, and he predicted that
before the next quadrennial the contri
butions will reach $2,000,000.
Wo requesj that in the assignment of the
Bishop's to their respective residences for the
coming quadrennium Bishop John \V. Hamil
ton, D.D.. LL.D., be assigned again to San
Francisco, and we make this request In view
of the fact that Bishop Hamilton has become
thoroughly acquainted with our problems and
.needs. He has done pplendid service as a
leader during the last quadrennlum, and every
Interest of the church has profited by his en
ergy, enthusiasm and devotion. There are en
terprises Inaugurated or fostered by him which
would be Imperiled, we fear, by his removal.
Hence, while we shall loyally welcome any one
of our chief pastors to residence in this Held,
we respectfully request that If the adjustment
of the work permits. Bishop Hamilton be once
more assigned to California.

The San Francisco Preathers' meeting re

Dr. Burt of Rome, Italy, delivered an
address on the labors of the Methodist
church in Rome.
The following resolution to go before
the General Conference at Los Angeles
Dr. Smyth Compliments The Call on
Its Convention Reports.
Never has so great an assemblage
of churchmen attended the weekly
meeting cf the Methodist Episcopal
Ministers' Association as at the delib
erations in Epworth Hall yesterday
morning.
It was unlike the usual rpeetings in
that there were in the audience scores
of men from over the wide world, and
instead of the methodical executive
session the doors were thrown open
and distinguished people met and ex
changed the heartiest congratulations
on the unparalleled success which at
tended the missionary convention that
closed on Sunday.
In giving thanks to the various
chairman and committees that worked
so arduously toward the consummation
of the success of one of the greatest
and most important gatherings San
Francisco has ever known, the Rev.
George B. Smyth, D.D.. chairman of
the executive committee, said:
All have worked nobly and unselfishly
toward the success attained and w<? are deeply
indebted to the San Francisco Call for the
generous manner it has given Its valuable
epare for the publication of the Important
matters which have come before the great mis
sionary convention.
The Call has done well by us indeed and I
cannot understand why it is that al! the pres9
haÂ« not shown the same appreciation of the
jjrebence In San Francisco of men of world
wide importance, men from afar over the ecas,
from India and Africa, from China and Japan,
from Kor^a and other parts.
When so distingAiish^d a people come to our
State, what better means of advertising could
we have?
MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY.
And right here has the California Promotion
Committee missed an opportunity, for somehow
It did not awake to the occasion of our hav
ine in our midst such men and women as never
before have frathered in this city.
That committee failed to give attention to
the irreat missionary convention â a convention
Â¦tter.ded at three meeting places by more
than 4000 people, and I trust that whenever
such sn asferublape a pa in comes to San Fran
cIfco the Promotion Committee will not forget
to give It the attention merited. To The Call
then I propose a vote of thanks and to the
editors personally.
The resolution was carried with the
accompaniment of loud and long con
tinued applause. Dr. Smyth calling
out, "The vote of thanks to The Call
i? carried unanimously."
Among the delegates to the General
Conference who were introduced to the
.association were the Rev. F. Ohlinger
from Foochow, China; Dr. 'Waugh of
Lucknow, India; Ernest Gideon Bok,
lay delegate from Germany, and Ding
Maine Ing, delegate from Foochow,
j China. Â»
In his -uldre.-s the Bishop thanked
his hearers lor the liberal donations
that were given for the cause, and said
he hoped ihe members would be true
and faithful to their church. Further,
lie stated that he was pleased to know
that the parish had furnished so many
worshipers in the growing district, and
he paid a glowing tribute to the mem
bers that had worked po hard to make
the new project a success.
The plans suggest a building that
will make a pretty addition to the
heights. Orders were given that no
expense should be spared in making
the edifice second to none in the out
lying district.
The plans call for a modern structure
with all improvements, and noth
ing will bo left undone to make the
church a beautiful building.

SPEARS OF BIG GATHERING
It required but a few weeks to secure
thf necessary sum, and plans were in
evidence in quick order for the erec
tion of a meeting: place that would be
a credit to the vicinity.
T^Ftorday was the day selected to
lay the comnrestono. Some 300 of the
enurr-h members werp in attendance.
At 3 o'clock Bishop Hamilton, after
wh'im ihe church was named, opened
the ceremonies. Prayers were offered,
and thin many of the members of the
congregation said words of praise for
the ncv: undertaking.
In thv cupper receptacle in the cor
nerstone copies of the local papers and
coins of different denominations bear
ing d.itc of thJs year were placed and
scaled and the stone was lowered into
place.
Ground was broken at the Bite of the
new Hamilton Methodist Episcopal
Church at Belvedere and Waller
streets yesterday afternoon.
Because of the increase in the popu-.
lation in the vicinity of Ashbury
Heights, the little church at the cor
ner, of which Rev. C. O. Oxnam is pas
tor, became too small. Some time ago
it was suggested that the edifice
was not large enough to accommodate
the worshipers of the district, and it
was decided that a larger and more
commodious nJace was desirable. In
accordance with this suggestion a sub
scription was started, and in a short
time enough funds were raised to make
the erection of a new church a cer
tainty.
