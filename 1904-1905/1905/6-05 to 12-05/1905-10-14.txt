ACTOR HENRY IRVING
DIES SUDDENLY.
- .
Tragedian Passes Away in England After
a Performance of "Becket.
LONDON. Oct. 15.â The English-speak-
ing world has suffered an irreparable loss
by the sudden death tc-night of Sir Henry
Irving', who wa.s universally regarded as
the. most representative English actor of
contemporary, times. Sir Henry died in
the harness. lie was giving a series of
farewell performances in the English
provinces and this week was flaying an
engagement at Bradford, appearing in
teveral favorite roles. Thursday he pre
sented "King Rene's Daughter" and "The
liells," and seemed to oÂ« in excellent
health, taking the exhausting part of
Hatthi&s in the latter play, with all the
vigor of youth. To-night, before an en
thusiastic littdfeace. he portrayed one of
his most characteristically intellectual
parts, the title role in his own stage
fcdaptation of Lord Tennyson's "Becket,"
with marked success.
After the performance Sir Henry re
turned to the hotel, reaching his rooms
et 11:30 o'clock, when it was observed
tiiat he was in great pain. Physicians
â¢were immediately summoned, LÂ»ui before
they could arrive Sir Henry was seized
v,-ith an attack of syncope and expired
within a . few minutes, without having
uttered a word. With him were Bram \
Etockcr, who has been his immediate
manager for many years, and a few other i
Intimate friends.
The Associated Press to-night received
the following telegram from Bram Stock
er: "Very terrible news. s;r Henry Irv
ing had an attack of syncope after re
turning from the theater to the hotel to
w right and died suddenly."
* 'To the last moment of his life Sir
Kenry Irving' s heart was in the work to
which he had devoted his careerâ the ral*.
Ing of the standard of his art. On Wed
nesday he was entertainea at luncheon in
the Bradford Town Hall, at which the
Mayor presented him with an address
from his admirers. In replying to the
address Sir Henry spoke of himself as
one whose sands of life were fast run
ning out, but no one then present had
the slightest Idea that the end would
come so soon. He proceeded In his reply
to eloquently advocate the establishment
of theaters by municipalities, "because,"
he said, "I believe that by this means
the standard of the true drama, as dis
tinguished from miscellaneous 'entertain
ments, would be successfully upheld.
"Money is enent like water for all kinds
of philanthropic and educational objects,"
Ihe continued, "but who among you ever
dreams of endowing the theater? I am
fcure the time will come when you will
regard the theater as necessary to -a
liberal education and be prepared to con
sider any reasonable suggestions for the
extension of its legitimate influence. It
may ba that in years to come our coun
trymen will scarcely understand how in
cur times so' potent an Instrument of
good or ill as the stage Is was left en
tirely outside the sphere of public admin
istration."
Sir Henry's last appearance in London
v/as made last summeK following his
serious Illness. Since then he has been
engaged in touring the provinces and con
templating another \-lsit to the United
States.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 13.â American
grievances against Venezuela may be
settled by diplomacy, . while France, in
the absence of any diplomatic relations
at Caracas, may yet be compelled'' to
resort to a show of force. Despite the
assurances of Foreign Office officials .at
Paris, it is said here that the French
ultimatum has been- practically ready
to dispatch for a week, or more and
that France has the full assent of the
Washington Government to adopt an
effective course against Venezuela to
effect the renewal of diplomatic rela
tions and the restoration of French
property seized by the Caracas Govern
ment, '^.j-i- \u25a0:. ' .
This briefly is the situation, to-night
The French ultimatum will be held up
until further .conferences' have occurred
between -the French .embassy here.and
j.he State. Department.*^ So farj as?Judge;
'Galhpun, ; -the Am"ericiii'"spe<;ial cbmrnlsr'
sioner, has reported to the department
there is, nqthing/lh;.the : i situation^ at
Caracas that cannot be settled ;byf. pa
tient ; and* firm diplomacy. American
and .French property, ;, It; Is con tended,
has been seized unjustly by President
Castro, -but, ample precedent is found
in history: for the settlement without
resort to force of problems far more
complicated than the present issue.
.While not prepared, to announce defi
nitely its exact course of action,- the
Washington Government has let France
know Informally its- belief that Amer
ican grievances against Venezuela, al
though complicated, can be settled
without the assistance of American
warships. This information was not
communicated with any intention of
forestalling a resort by France to force,
but was in answer to the earnest re
quell of the Paris Government. Public
opinion in France is rapidly becoming
exhausted over the delay of the Gov
ernment in proceeding against .Vene
zuela and this fact necessarily .lets as a
spur in the conferences between Paris
and Washington. This Government
will give France every possible assist
ance toward a diplomatic adjustment.
A thorough: understanding exists be
tween Paris and Washington on this
subject and even if France shall find
it necessary to establish a pacific block
ade against Venezuela the Washington
Government j will . offer no - objection,
having already assured itself that the
Monroe doctrine is not involved in any
way. : .
In diplomatic circle the opinion is
expressed ' that "the Venezuelan Presi
dent would yield before a pacific block
ade is established. The aversion on
thepart of France and the United
States to the use of warships in this
case arises from the fact that the.
blockading of Venezuelan ports at this
time" will affect' not so much Venezeula
as it will the creditor- powers, to whom
a portion of the customs ..receipts has
been awarded by The Hague tribunal
until their claims shall have been paid
in full. ' ~;~--'x^-:.

This statement is corroborated by Barney

Ellis continues hiÂ« -account of conver

Fteamer by admitting that Andrews pro
posed to him that they engage In crooked,
criminal work in America, citing to EHls
his own success in that line. Andrews
In this connection told Ellis ihat he had
once induced a young man in Chicago
to embezzle tlO.OOO and then had won most
of the money from the embezzler at
cards. .
Andrews Informed his companion from
Australia that a big <3i?.3iond ring he
'wore was obtained when he shot a man

Ellis with distrust so that he had fully

Colorado Authorities Sent Oat.
BERKELEY, Oct. 13. â Convincing
proof Hint William Ellis, the Austral
tan turfman, vras in tbe clutches of one
of the ntost desperate, nioat hunted nad
mo*! fiendish criminal* : of America
vrb'en he permitted himself to be. lured
Into a trap net for hlÂ» butchery la a
Derkelry house last Wednesday, wnÂ»
found hy the police authorities this
fuonlng, when perfect identification
was made of Wlllinm Brash as Milton
Franklin Andrew*, who murdered Bes
sie Bouton on Mount Cutler, near Colo
rado Springy, last October and left her
nude l>od j. backed and burned, to He
ou the top of a lonely peak under Colo
rado sides.
William Ellis, lying with ekull frac
tured by a blow from a hammer
wielded by Andrews, or "BruBh." to
day identified a photograph of Andrews
taken from the police records as that
of William Brush, alias Curtis, who
had decoyed, him to America from Aus
tralia, - and after losing \u25a0 hie hold in
part on the victim, had sought to take
the Australian's life last Wednesday in
the* iittie cottage at 2214 Ellsworth
Btreeu -
In addition to this positive identifi
cation of Brush as Andrews, are a mul
titude of facts which demonstrate to
the police beyond the possibility of a
doubt that Brush was indeed no less a
criminal than Andrews, and that ' his
plans with respect to Ellis' murder In
cluded theÂ» butchery of the Australian
and the \u25a0 hacking of his body, just as
po.or .t Bessie Bouton's body . w^a
mangled when Andrews murdered the
beautiful frirl a year ago.
\u25a0 DESCniPTIONS IDENTICAL.
. The detailed description of Andrews,
\u25a0which the police of Colorado Springs
sent broadcast after it was shown that
he had killed Bessie Bouton there, tal
lies to a dot with Ellis' description of
"Brush."'
So complete Is the accord of the
Colorado description and of the" facts '
griven by ESlis, with others which- re- ;
late to the attempted killing of Ellis '
In Berkeley, that an outsider, hearing ;
of thÂ« two different sets of descriptive;
data, might fancy they had been writ
ten by. the -same person at the same
tinVe^rom the same set of facts.
Milton Franklin Andrews was a no
torious gambler, described as a "shark"
and known as "Longshot" Andrews.
"Brush" displayed his caliber as a
"shark" when he fleeced passengers on
the Sonoma coming over from Aus
tralia. - ' f
Andrews, in the official circular sent
out after the Bessie Bouton murder,
was specifically referred to as a con
stant purchaser of a peculiar form of
health food made by the Battle Creek
Sanitarium. His weak stomach made
the use of such food tablet a necessity.
The 1 Colorado' police, in advising other
Police Departments ;of Andrews* hab
its, said: â '.
â¢ "He Is a neat dresser, wears expensive
clothing and has numerou^ fancy vests.
Hia laundry is principally marked 'M.F.,
â¢M.F.A.' and 'G.B.* ,
-"He" Is- afflicted with stonrach" trouble,
and. buys quantities of malted milk and
health foods. The very first thing he
does on his arrival in a city Is to look
.up a Battle Creek cafe, or store where
such supplies are sold, and buys prin
cipally foods manufactured by the-Bat
tj* Creek Sanitarium. ....
! ."Watch all branches of the Battle Creek
Sanitarium and he will more than likely
"be found around such places purchasing
food."
.V HEALTH FOOD FOUXD.
Now the police have found, in the din-
ing-room of the Berkeley house occupied
by Andrews, scattered among the edibles
which constituted the luncheon laid for
Ellis, as a guest last Wednesday, a quan
tity of the identical health tablets from
' the. Battle Creek Sanitarium, which are
referred to In the Colorado Springs cir
cular. ';':.'jy.^^...
The Colorado Springs circular describes
the scar on Andrews* cheex. which Ellis

facial features and measurements In

"Brush's" Identity. In searching through
the rile of police circulars In the office
this mortilng .he found the circular de
scribing Andrews, the murderer of Bessie
Bouton, and was at once struck by the
resemblance between the printed descrip
tion of. Andrews and Ellis' description of
"Brush." -He Informed Marshal Vollmer
of his find and. the photographic print
of Andrews .was at once taken to Ellis
at the Roosevelt Hospital.
When Ellis looked at the picture he
said: .
'That Is Brush. I would know his hide
if It was taken .oft and nailed to a' tree."
REWARD FOR BOUTOV MURDER.
There, Is a. re ward of $2000 offered for
Andrews', capture by the county of El
Parso. -Colorado, the offer having followed
the Bouton murder of which Andrews
was believed to.be guilty. He fled from
Colorado after the tragedy on Mount'Cut
lÂ«Ti Slaving a- long start of the police, as
the body ofÃesste Bouton was not found
until weeks after she had been murdered.
.. The circular sent out by W. 8.; Rey :

dated February; 6, 1905, reads as follows:

"W. S. REYNOLDS, Chief of Police."
"Colorado . Springs, Colo., February 6,

The penchant of Andrews for "numer

house after the attempt .to mtirder Ellis.

The body oi.Mrs. Bouton wasnot de

The career . of Andrews in California
last year preceding his connection with
i the murder of Bessie Bouton Is recalled
Ino.w, and. lt. is remembered that at Cat
allna iÃland, and later .in Denver he
was. known as a card " player and a
constant winner. . . He traveled with
i Bessie Bouton. a, widow, whose home
' wjifi in Syracuse, he havjng posed be
: fore her as a wealthy English invalid.
' They were accompanied on this coast
i by Bessie Bouton's sister, Mrs\Charles
Nelson, until Southern California was
reached, when the Nelson woman' left
them. To Denver the pair traveled aud
thence to Colorado Springs. The mur
der of -Bessie Bouton occurred. ln Oc

en her life." His .disappearance was

HOPE TO EFFECT CAPTURE, j
With Andrews' Identity perfectly es
tablished and the police every/where
through the country searching for him
there is felt little doubt that.,he,and
his female companion wjll soon be ap
prehended. Marshal Vollmer has in
formation regarding their movements
which has not been given out, but
which "he is confident will lead to the
capture of the couple, ... -
An ingenious theory of, how Andrews
may perhaps be finally landed Is that
the Woman now with him will turn
against the" man when she learns by
reading of the reports now being tele
graphed to all newspapers of. Andrews'
Identity and record and of the lik'ell
hood there is that she is likely to be
Andrews' next victim if she continues
to associate. with hhn. ._ , _ _ ' . }', '
The couple undoubtedly will read
newspapers wherever they- are, and. the
woman's natural . procedure, according
to this theory of the detectives,' is 'that
she will.be sure to give up her com
panion, turn State's evidence and con
vict Andrews, while saving her Own
neck and avoiding part of the .penalty
for her complicity with .her fiendish
consort. â¢â¢ . â¢ .... \u25a0 â¢
The usual. Irresponsible from
persons who fancy they have informa
tion to contribute regarding the fugi
tive's movements are coming In to
Marshal Vollmer. An anonymous note
from Vallejo, received to-day, .an
nounces that the writer had seen a de
scription of Andrews ' and that the ,
writer had seen tbe . man In Vallejo
the night before; had seen him board
a Southern Pacific boat In the morn
ing of the v next. day at 7 o'clock; 'that
the man"wrote something and "handed
it to a man on'the gate"; that he "had
a very long ticket and was evidently
going very far. off.".. The writer con
cluded by declaring that he. had. "been
a detective for many years and could
not be mistaken." ..; .. v '

Denver News, date of October S,- 1904,
containing an account bf a murder
mystery, wh.ich'accou'rit seemed to have
interested Andrews very' much, for he
had torn out bits of the story, dcfa'clng
it for purposes of his own.' â¢
The article told Of the finding in Den
i ver of a woman's -trunk, 1 belonging to
Miss Julian Ward.* tinder-such circum
stances as' to lead; the Denver police
to suspect that' the young woman had
been' murdered and spirited- away and
her trunk rifled by the murderer. It
;is thought that Andrews' Interest; in
this case was " greater than ' that of a
mere reader.* and that the-account of
the affair described part of trfe'man's
own work In a case where. he. may. have
esraped without suspicion. It was. but
a few days after that that he .murdered
Bessie Bouton : in the same State. .
The article referred. to in the Denver

WABHI^GTON,^ deb 13.â An Impor

contagious -diseases "was taken to-day
\vhen_the members of the International
Sanifary '"Convention "accepted the
forty-nine, articles of the. Paris con
vention of â¢â¢December 3. 1903, with only
such modifications as are reauired by
the conditions in tropical countries.
The -ariltles," which are now engrossed
in Spanish and English, will be signed
by the delegates
and. when .ratified: by the different
Soutjj and North .American Govern
ments, there will be on practically all
of the f American" continent one system
of quarantine and preventive measures.
This .is; calculated to put an end to the
evil of: undoing; good work in one
State, by the negligent methods in a
neighboring State.
It was decided that the United States
Pharmacopla should be translated into
Spanish and that a first edition of 5000
copies should be published.
.â¢;!pV. L.\O: Howard, the entomologist of
the .Department of Agriculture, ., who
has- rriade" a special study ;of the
mosquito, read a paper on that insect.
In regard to the distance the. mosqui
toes are able to fly out on the sea (a
question of great importance when de
termining how far ships under quar
antine shall stay away from shore) he
stated that It has been found impos
sible for mosquitoes to move out aa
far as 500 feet.
"Holy water fonts In churches are
often the breeding place for the yellow
fever mosquitoes," declared Dr. How
ard.- The statement was supported by
many of the. other delegates present.
After electing vice presidents among
the delegates of' the various countries
represented the convention elected Drs.
Wyman, Moor, Liceaga, . Ulloa, Gult
eras, Rhelll, Goode of Mobile, Ala., and
A. H. Doty of New York, members of
a' body ,'tO.be : known- as the "Interna

LONDON, Oct. 14.â The news of the
death of Sir Henry Irving was re
ceived too late to permit of more k than
brief announcements in this morning's
newspapers.'; The Dally Telegraph and
the Morning . Post, \u25a0 however, print
lengthy memoirs, speaking of Irving
as the greatest . actor of hia period.
The Morning Post says: -. ' ' \
"No stronger personality, ho more
unflagging activity ; has within long
memory adorned t the .English stage.
His death is a national loss and" his
memory a . national possession. Had
he gone to the bar .he would have
reached the bench; If into the" church
he would surely have become a
Bishop. .He chose the stage and was
easily the foremost actor of his .time."
The Times .says: \u25a0' . r
"Henry, Irving .was a great actor,
but his greatness spruhg,from adlffer
ent source than that of any other, actor
who can be mentioned.'- The success of
his famous -predecessors, lay in., their
power to affectjthe emotions of the au

.Slr. SIr H ? ni T. ,I, Il TT I .i?Br ; was . the \ foremost
tragedian of* the, day. . Hia genius had
given him rank with the Hst of celebrities
which Includes' Garrlck and Booth. With
Coquelin arid "Mansfield -he. was- pre-emin
ent In . his'art. Irving 'was ; more than an
actor. He was. a, student, thinker and .an
earnest worker, in the .'cause ot progress.
Although sixty' years* of age at the. time
of his 4eath, Jie was .actively-engaged
in a campaign "In behalf of the municipal
theater." Of Irving" it has been said that
he .did.more than any. other man in. his
tory^ to elevate; the. stage?- \u25a0 No better. e,vi-
Jdeifce' of. .his" success .6pul& be 'found than
the fact that.he -jvas knighted in- 189$ by
Queen Victoria, 'the 'first, actor, to be so

.his way to the hearts of the people. The
eyes of two generations . In Europe and
America, have- grown tear-dlmmed and
smiled with the vagaries of his art. \u25a0 .
...The actor's. name was originally Henry

.purposes and. ..later .legalized -
.ADOPTS STAGE AS CAREER.
The career of Sir Henry Irving'- Is an
example of -strong- purpose,- nobly con
ceived, bravely maintained . and ; courage
ously-battled for- in the face of bitter dis
couragement and obstacles which would
have dashed the 'hopes of- a less fearless
and determined spirit.- He was given de
grees by several- of the great
and- numbered -among his friends "many
of the most famous; men in E-arope and
America. ,; All- this'-was- achieved by the
force of his ; own, character, for Irving
had ', no advantages S of . birth, . no family
influence,, and never received., be fore be
ginning a business career more, than a
very, ordinary school training.
. While worklng-as a clerk, Irving began
to develop stage ambition. He joined an
elocution class and took- part In its axna
teum productions. About this time he
met Samuel. Phelps, a famous 'actor. , The
great actor 'received. Irving kindly, and
even went so far as to offer him an en
gagement: but he accompanied .the pro
posal . with the discouraging words:
"Young man, have nothing to do with the
stage; it is a bad profession."
When he was between IS and 19 years
old Irving* finally' decided to adopt the
stage as a,, profession. This, of course.

was against the protests of his family,
but inclination and talent were no longer
to be denied."
Declining Phelps' offer, because he did
not wish tcr* appear in London before
he had properly learned his business.
Irving obtained an engagement at Sun
derland, in a new theater to be opened
by E. D. Davis. .The. date was the
29th of September, 1856, and the first
play, to be presented was "Richelieu."
In this Irving* appeared as the Duke of
Orleans, and it Is somewhat- significant
that' the ; first words he spoke on the
stage were the opening words of. the
play: "Here'a to our enterprise.".
Irving does - not -seÂ«m >to- have made
any success in this char
acter, and in 'the next which "he essayed,
Cleomenes in "The Winters Tale."'Vas
no more impressive.'' \u25a0'" 'â¢''\u25a0\u25a0' * ' "
APPEARS " WITH TERRY.
The following season Irving obtained
&n' engagement at" tho> Theater- Royal,'
Edinburgh," then "under the. management
of R.- ; H.- -Wyndham. Here he had
the opportunity !of playing- with many
of . the most . famous stars who visited
Scotland. At this time his remuneration
was the princely sum of 30 shillings, or
about 17 60 per. -week. For this amount
he played such important parts as Ban
quo, Macduff, and Dazzle in "London
Assurance," and Henry Bertram with
Charlotte Cushman." . '- ;
Ho next tried public, reading, but- not
a soul, came on the opening night and
the plan v was abandoned. *
His first success was with a company
in Manchester, where he .gained .local
popularity. It was here that he first tried
Hamlet. ,- * \u25a0 ... : . : . . .
Irving then went to the Queen's Thea
ter, Long Acre, which haa been since
destroyed, and joined as leading man a
very excellent company under the direc
tion of that admirable ' actor. Alfred
[ Wigan. Irving's first . appearance was
made as Petruchlo, and It Is worthy of
note that on that occasion .Katharine
was played by Miss Ellen Terry, this be
ing the first time. these two players had
been in' the same cast. \u25a0 Several melo
dramas by Byron and" ' Watts . Phillips
were produced during the season with
more or' less success.
IX THE ROLE OP HAMLET.
iln 1869' Irving played a. very brief en
gagement at the Haymarket. and after
.ward a more profitable - one in the play
"Formosa," by Dion Boucicault, given
at Drury Lane, and in a play by H. J.
Byron, called "Uncle Dick's Darling,'.'
produced at the Gaiety^ Theater. Irving
made a really great success " In London.
This was founded upon a Christmas story
by Charles Dickens, and Irving's per
formance of Mr. Chevenix, which seema
to have been modeled on Mr. Dombcy.
won the unqualified approval of Dickens
himself. Next year he gained renown as
a tragedian in "The Two Roses."
' It was on the 21st of October. IST4, that
Irving first played "Hamlet" in London.
The occasion was naturally one of Intense
interest and eager anticipation for the
public, and a most trying ordeal for the
actor. . According to the report of the
ablest critics Irving did not make any
very great Impression during the first
two acts, but the third produced a com- â¢
plete change. . From the scene with the
players, and the description of the im
aginary portraits, the evening was a con
tinual triumph, which reached a climax
of enthusiasm that' probably has never
been surpassed in, at* Eastisb tb*atÂ«ri-.
Colonel Bateman, Â»vhose name was the
extremely, peculiar one of Hezeklah Lin
thicum Bateman. died suddenly during
the run of "Hamlet," gn the 22d of \u25a0
March. IST3, and the management was as
sumed by Mrs. Bateman. Upon her re-^
tlrement Irving assumed the manager
ship of the theater.
AT HEIGHT OF SUCCESS. . .
Irving went to the Lyceum when, after
some mediocre success, he made a great
hit in "The Bells." which took the city'
by storm. After this success followed fa3t
upon success.
Among the plays associated with Sir
Henry Irving are: "Hamlet," 'The Mer
chant of Venice." "Macbeth." "Twelfth.
Night," "Othello." "Henry VIII." "King \
Richard III." "Louis XI." "Waterloo."
"The Bells." "Richelieu." 'The Vicar. of "
Wakefleld." "Courier of Lyons," "Faust."
"Becket," "King Arthur," "Werner**
and "Ravenswood."
Irving made several visits to Americaâ
in fact, he had made plans to visit this
country ' again in 190&- Irving's last ap
pearance in San Francisco was In the
late summer of 1593. He was accompanied
by Ellen Terry and played with great
success, at the Grand Opera-house.
Among the mos.t notable of his produc
tions at that time were "The Bella."
"Olivia," 'The Merchant of. Venice,'*
"Louis XI" and "Becket."

GREAT STRENGTH TO THE ENTIRE FUSION TICKET.
JOHN S. PARTRIDGE AS HE APPEARED BEFORE THE ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS AT PIONEER AND NATIVE SONS' HALLS.
TWO DISTRICTS
GREET NOMINEES
Forty-Second â¢ and Forty-Third
Welcome the Fusionists.
LEADER'S "TALK WINS VOTES
To the Forty-second and Forty-third districts belongs the honor of being the
first to open the Partridge district campaign, and the rousing meeting last night
at Native Sons 1 Hall attested the enthusiastic spirit of the voters in those dis
tricts. Although, through an error, it was announced that the fusion candidate
would speak at a late hour, owing to a meeting at Pioneer Hall, the build
ir.g Ulled at an early hour, and throughout Mr. Partridge's speech crowds poured
through the doors.
The popular young candidate for Supervisor from the Forty-second, John A.
McCee. presided at the meeting, and his opening address was a splendid effort
He s-poke of the inauguration of the district meeting campaign, and said the
meeting was called as a means for devising how to rid the districts of Job
chasers. He denied any association dominated and controlled the fusion party
and defied the opposition to prove. such the case,, and as a refutation pointed
to the record of John S. Partridge.
He said that when an issue was needed In a campaign the old cry of class
against class was resurrected, and added that the' only issue was the unfltness
of Schmitz for the office of Mayor. As an example of Schmitz's love for the
poor man the speaker pointed to the fact that the Mayor allowed Gray Bros, to
blast the ground from beneath the poor on Telegraph Hill and in the Fairmount
tract. To the charge that the Grand Jury was a packed body, McGee said that
. the Superior Judges had the selection of that body and were not amenable to the
influence of Schmitz or anybody else. <\u25a0
City Attorney Long was the next speaker and added his testimony about,
graft to the evidence now laid before the people. He said good government
meant good streets, schools and protection of life and property. The present
campaign, he declared, is a most notable one, and the first where Democrats
end Republicans have combined for decent government, and he declared, using
the colloquial phrase, "that It was up to the people to decide for incompe
tency and Indecency or efficiency and decency." ?y .
Carey Van Fleet, the next speaker, delivered some stralght-from-the-shoul
der remarks about the rowdyism of the galleries at the Republican convention^
and referred to the Mayor as the man who had lost his Identity. The questionr
he declared, was fairly put, "Are you going to vote with the half-world or with
the decent element?" The other speakers of the evening were H. U. Branden
etein. Daniel A. Ryan, Jesse W. Bryan and Dr. A. A. D'Ancona.
Following Van Fleet's speech, Chairman McGee Introduced Mr. Partridge,
\u25a0who spoke in part as follows:
GBAFTER IS JUST AN ORDINARY THIEF.
..â¢,. \u25a0:.,-\u25a0 "The man who grnttu Is not a Republican; be Is not a Democrat; he la
not a Soclalint; he In not a labor union man: he's junt a plain thief.
"The grafter Is the most non-partisan character in the world. The
dollar looms so big before his eye that he can't see anything else. The
lure of the loot is leading him to Inevitable destruction, but he never sees
the danger. You can no more expect efficient government from a crowd
bent on graft than you could expect a burglar to lock your safe If he hap
pened to find it open.
"During the last few weeks many men have expressed surprise to me
that so few of the grafters get caught. You can't talk to a crowd on the
street corner without hearing: some story of extortion â of men who have
been compelled to pay large sums of money for permits or licenses to
â¢which they were plainly entitled, or who have bought Immunity for some
Illegal transaction. f : " ; t;l
"Why aren't these grafters prosecuted? people ask me. "Why, It's the
â¢implest thing In the world- It's because the man* who has been compelled
to yield is afraid to tell.
"The statutes of all the States recognize that graft is a peculiar crime,
In that the only witnesses are the parties to it. For that reason the
statutes provide that any man who had paid bribe money can testify before
the Grand Jury and secure Immunity from prosecution. But actual crimi
nal prosecutions are not the only terrors. There Is the publicity, the dis
grace. So men rather submft to extortion than take tHe chances of a pub
lic Bcandal.
"Let me tell you about 'Doc* Ames of Minneapolis.- 'Doc' Ames was four
times Mayor of Minneapolis. He was a very good physicianâ generous to a
fault, always ready to give his services for nothing to those who could not af
ford to pay. Big and bluff and hearty, the nort extreme type cf tha 'gool fel
low.' he won men's hearts. He was no fraud, eitherâ ln the beginning.
STORY OF THE DOWNFALL OF 3IAYOR A3IES.
"The people -elected him to various minor offices, and finally he ran for
tlayor on the Republican ticket and was* elected. There came on a primary un/
der the new Minnesota law for direct nominations. Most of the citizens of Min
neapolis were too busy to vote, and Ames received the Republican nomination.
He didn't care anything about politics. He ran in a Presidential year, and came
out in the papers announcing that he was going to 'reform.'
"The great Republican majority carried him into the Mayor's chair for the
fourth time, and he set about reforming himself. He changed from a 'spender'
Into an official 'on the make.' Hitherto he had been satisfied to let his follow
ers make the money, while he took the honors. All this he now proceeded to ,
change. He formed a 'cabinet* and laid out a deliberate and comprehensive
scheme of graft. He made his brother, a disgraced army officer, who had es
caped court-martial for cowardice only through a 'pull,' Chief of Police. The
police force was entirely reorganized. One hundred and seven patrolmen who
couldn't be 'handled' were summarily dismissed. One Norman TV. King was
made Chief of Detectives. "IflffyMHlPj l ?!
"Ames and King then proceeded to eextentd t a general invitation to ajl the
thieves, pickpockets and sure-thing men they could reach to come to Minneapo
lis and ply their trades under police protection. There was a. general jail.deliv
ery of all the crooks awaiting trial. These were organized into groups, and
* detectives were assigned to assist end . dirtect them. â¢ A regular schedule was
established by which the thieves got a certain percentage and the rest was di
vided among the police officials and the Mayor.
CITY TURNED OVER TO THE' RULE OF VICE.
"All over the city opium Joints, 'blind pigs,' swindling gambling places and
disorderly houses masked as candy and tobacco stores were established. Mock
auctions and all sorts of cheating games were held nightly. From these sources
alone the Mayor received, according to the evidence afterward adduced, about
"These things became so notorious that the Sheriff of the county interfered, v
and arrested several 'sure-thing* men. The Mayor immediately trumped up
charges against him, supported them by perjured testimony and had the Sheriff
removed. â¢''\u25a0 '\u25a0â¢\u25a0
"Still the people did nothing, because there was no evidence.
"But the thieves got; to. fighting among themselves. The Mayor's crowd got
Â«o irreedy that the 'sure-thing* men couldn't make/ a living. .
"About this timeâ in ' April. 1592-a new Grand Jury was drawn. Among them
was a hard-eyed roan named Clarke-Harry C. Clarke. He/was a fighter
through and through. They made : him foreman. When he said he was going
after the Ames gang, men shook their heads, and told him he couldn t do any
"^larke cot hold of some of the men who had been fleeced and Jthe'n hustled
out of town The Mayor was . indicted. A new bill was found against his ,
brother and this time they convicted him." ,By this time the city was fully,
aroused, and the grafters in a panic. Two heads of department*, against whom ;.
nothing had been charged, ran away. Mayor Ames himself fled, and the decent j
THE SAN rFRAN^CISCO CALL- OCTOBER 14; 1905.
RUEF'S GAME IN NORTH
END DISTRICT EXPOSED
G rafters Mar Down the Banners of Fusion
and Assault Union Painters.
The grafters have deemed it advisable
to diminish the number of Schmitz ban
ners and signs on the Barbary Coast.
The withdrawal of these emblems of graft
from the saloon fronts of Jackson and
Pacific streets should not be accepted as
proof that the keepers are no longer
enthusiastic for Schmitz. Ruef is en
dowed with some cunning, as a politician
and at this time would like to convey the
impression to the executive campaign
committee of the fusion organization that
he is not making special efforts for
Bchmitz in the north end of San Fran
cisco.
The real facts are that Ruef and his
ablest henchmen are making an under
cover contest In the Forty-fourth and
Forty-fifth Assembly districts. Ruef ex
pects to give Daniel A. Ryan, Thomas W.
Hlckey, Curtis Hillyer, Louts Sloss, Fair
fax H. Wheelan and Gavin McNab a
complete surprise. The boss is particu
larly, desirous of carrying his own vest
pocket district, the Forty-fifth, by a tre
mendous majority for Schmitz. He x would
be delighted beyond expression If he could
down Gavin McNab in the Forty-fourth.
A big personal triumph for himself in his
home district and a defeat for McNab\
in the latter's home district would con
sole Ruef in some degree for the defeat
of Schmitz. V
Gavin 'McNab is pretty welh posted as
to. the meaning of the mystery surround
ing the campaign for graft In the north
end.. Ruef would have the "ha-ha" on
McNab if the Forty- fourth, which was
carried by Crocker two years ago when
there were three tickets In the field,
should be won by Schmitz over the fusion
forces In this campaign.
MERCHANTS TO CONTRIBUTE.
Louis -Slops and his associates of the
finance committee of the fusion organiza
tion yesterday exchanged views with
quite a number, of business men on the
subject of . contributions in the cause of
common honesty. Assurances given at
BRANDENSTEIN RECEIVES SUPPORT
OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY BYINGTON
Announcement Made at Meeting of Constituents of the
Fusion Nominee for the Office of Prosecutor!
The political atmosphere has become
clearer by the authentic announcement
that Lewis F. Byington, the present Dis
trict' Attorney, has endorsed Henry U.
Brandenstein, the . Democratic and Re
publican . nominee for District Attorney,
and that his support will be given' ; to
the entire Fusion ticket.. The .announce
ment was made at the Brandenstein- Club
meeting. â¢ -
Irrespective .of party affiliations,/ the
friends of Henry U. Brandenstein, can
didate for the office of District Attor
ney on the Fusion ticket,, gathered last
night in Stanford Hall lln â¢ the Alcazar
building and organized a club to take
an energetic part in. his campaign. In the
crowd were attorneys, business men, : la
boring men and practically ' the entire
force ; which has held office under Dis
trict Attorney Byington. ; The hall was
crowded and the utmost enthusiasm : pre
. vailed. It was positively announced , at
the meeting that Lewis. F. Bylngton will
stand by his . party "and will support [ the
ticket. This announcement- was cheered
heartily by the ' . ; ' \u25a0
Assistant District Attorney Weller, who
was authorized to announce . the : position
which the' Incumbent of [ the' District At
torney's office'wlll take In ;thls campaign,'
took \u25a0 occasion to '< pay *'\u25a0 a'< tribute : . to \ the
ability,/ energy " ' and [ ' faithfulness ; ; lwlth
which Byington has [ conducted the affairs
of his â¢ office. * He ' emphatically, denied ; the
assertion which was \ made on j, the ; pre
vious ' evening at a Langdon meeting - that
the District Attorney's ?. office ;Is ? behind
people of , the city were once .more in control. \
"Talking. about- graft doesn't help the situation. You must all work if
you wantr to: redeem' the city.
Â«An your candidate I; am going. to do my port. I have given the grafters
fair Warning to do their worst, and they have logt.no time In 'doing it.
~ . .'-'They \u25a0 will fool you if " they. can. Their game in St. Louis "r. was ; to
blacken the, reputation I" of Joe ii Folk: by lies about his personal character.
They are trying the same thlnK.here,' ;but if ) you . refuse to %beX turned ' aside
fromUhe'real battle," If, you ;keep, ever you, the 'Jssue /of j {common
honesty arid a square "deal,'* victory is ; as certain as the coming -of election
day." ;
the conference were gratifying to the
committee. Money required for precinct
organization and other operations of the
campaign v/ill be contributed by citizens
who are determined to oust the grafters
from control of the municipality. Au
thorized collectors will present their cre
dentials to the merchants and- business
men of San Francisco and the response
to the call of the committee should be
prompt and generous. ' â¢ \-;,
Women of San Francisco who are in
sympathy with the crusade against vice
and corruption will be among the con
tributors to the campaign fund.
Last night authoritative" announcement
was made in a public meeting that L. F.
Bylngton,- District Attorney, - was a
stanch supporter of the fusion nominees
and would use : earnest effort to promote
the election of H. U. Brandenstein.
Rowdy tactics have become rampant
throughout the city now that the Schmitz
crowd realizes its desperate straits. Mis
creants are pulling down Partridge ban
ners and men wearing Partridge buttons
are insulted by the hoodlums. The fllng
ing of stones and perpetrating of as
saults on the union painters engaged in
painting * fusion campaign signs are
among the latest outrages.
HOODLUMS ARE BtSV.
From the time, of the newsboys' strike
the. ruffianly element has been turbulent
and unruly and the demoralized police are
reluctant to quell disorder. With but one
man of i backbone and moral courage and
he is a true union man, on the police
board, with a figurehead chief of police,
with policemen --In fear of the adminis
tration lash, the hoodlums take advan
tage of every opportunity to break loose
and insult public decency. -
At Hayes and Laguna streets a . large
Partridge banner was torn to shreds dur
ing the night. and the remnants kicked
about the streets. On East street also
a Partridge banner was torn down. .At
Fourth street near Folsom a man placing
that candidate, and in doing so he called
attention^, to the fact that there were

Attorneys Rouert Ferral, R. V.' Whit-

Warrant Clerk T. I. Fltzpatrlck, Thomas
J. Kennedy," Louis Ferrari and Frank A.
Costello, and that they, standing for i the
best interests of their office," were active
ly engaged , In supporting Brandenstein.
Jeremiah F. Sullivan of the firm? of
Sullivan & Sullivan, one of the most En
thusiastic workers in Brandenstein's
campaign, sent a letter to the meeting, ex
pressing regret that he could ; not be
present, but ( promising 1 his hearty I co-op
eration in whatever^the club might decide
to do to further the candidacy of Super

Sullivan â¢ paid ' high tribute to : the hon
esty, : integrity .'\u25a0 and -\u25a0'â¢. faithful devotion r to

He called attention^ to the splendid rep

of the Finance Committee . of the Board
of Supervisors,; and * stated that he : be-J
lieved that as "a District Attorney Brandt

ests of the city and would administer: the
affairs of â¢ his . office : with impartiality arid

the card of a fusion candidate over his
door was assailed with a shower ofÂ«nud
and stones, while in the vicinity of Fifth
and Sixth streets in the gas house
trlct hoodlums assaulted two union paint
ers with stones. Throughout the city
union painters at work on fusion ticket
sigijs have been called vile names and
threatened with -bodily injury and many
have expressed themselves as discouraged
by the abuse and after completing one
job have refused any more; work.
Though .the attacks on painters may
continue before the eyes of. the blind po
lice force, the painters and all other union
labor men who are sick of grafting and
Schmitz misrule will have an opportunity
to even .things when election day comes.

The Schmitz boss, through his mes
senger, the Registrar, has issued an or
der excluding citizens from witnessing
the opening of the new voting machines
as they are unj^acked at the City Hall.
Because of the fear of double dealing and
tampering with the machines, the Re
publican _ League has employed John Mc-
Carthy to .watch the handling of the ma
chines which are placed temporarily In
the basement of the City Hall.
When the first machine was opened
McCarthy was present and saw 'that it
was in good /working order. The pre
cautions taken by the League annoyed
the Registrar, who sought advice, and the
outcome is, .the . placing of , the machines
in the large' registration office. While the
machines are being unpacked and put to

TWENTY-NINTH'S CITIZENS
PACK PIONEER HALL
Speakers of the Fusion Ticket Drive
:| Home Facts About the "Gang."
Dr. John Dillon Tells of Experiences
x With the Administration. .
Any doubt as to where the respectable element of the Twenty-ninth Dis
trict stands In the fight for decency and clean city government was removed
last night at Pioneer Hall, when the pacned house and crowded streets greeted
John S. Partridge, the Fusion candidate, with cheers and applause upon his
appearance at the district rally. Already Mr. Partridge had addressed the citi
zens of the Forty-second and Forty-third districts, and. In the midst of Dr..
Dillon's speech, Was hoisted to the platform for an ovation.
One of the principal events of the Twenty-ninth's rally was the firm stand
for decency taken by Dr. Dillon, one of the most respected and beloved men
..south of ~ Market street. In all the homes of the worklngmen south of the
great thoroughfare there Is hardly one where a voice is not heard in praise and:
respect for *.ie physician who has devoted fcis life and energy to healing thm
sick among those who are destitute. , - - ..,..â¢â¢.
Dr. Dillon was presented by Chairman Leon Samuels and spoke as follows:
""I have lived in the Twenty-ninth District for yeais and nave always trledto
do.my duty and what I consider right and honest. I am here to urge the work-,
ingman to stand for honest and true government. -..-â¢â¢-\u25a0
\u25a0 . "As a result I am here to speak in lavor of John S. Partridge. I never knew
. a men who was good to his mother and supported his family to fail to do,- his
duty as a man or. as an official, -with no other, interest than honesty and purity
of government. */ "
"The most astonishing thing I have heard recently, was the statement mads
*in this hall . by the Mayor who declared that there was no graft. One day
during my term as health officer I passed a load of meat south of .Market
street on the way to be sold to the butchers. Half of the meat was eaten by
tubercular abscesses. I stopped the driver and told him to appear at the City
Hall. He was not even fined and the words used to me were: 'Doc, you're not
a meat inspector; you are only a health officer and shouldn't interest yourself
in the matter. Besides, you didn't catch him selling, the meat.* . /
' "As for the reward of honest work: One day I was ordered to Inspect the
dairies. I made visits and recommended changes, but afterward was informed
. that I had better not go back to the places, as a curly haired lawyer had been;
retained to see about those* things. During my short term I was obliged to
pay |7 L 0 a month out of my salary to a club. I have the receipts. Do you want
.to trust such an administration, or will you trust that of a man who will
be good to the poor because he is a poor man himself? If ho makes any
promises he will keep them." â¢-i'J , * 3L**;*
Mr. Partridge, the next speaker, was warmly greeted and spoke in part as
follows: - - "â¢
WAX FAT WITH WEALTH OTHER MEN EAEN.
"Some one has said that no man can pet money without earning It
unless some other man earns money without getting it. Aside from, the
moral, aspect of the case that's the oruel. practical side of this graft busi
ness. When money Is spent In salaries that ought to so for improvements
the idle tax-eater is taking the money of the men who own small homes
and pay to support *the Government. "When money is paid for' permits
somebody has had to work for it without being able to keep it. This de
sire to get something for nothing Is doing more to ruin the weak men
of our country than everything else put together. The man who lives
by the sweat of another man's brow Is an enemy of the republic.. I
want you to bear that in mind down here in the Twenty-ninth District.
"I nant to mx to the honest irorklng men of this district that ao
grafter ever .was, or ever will bf, their friend. . I want to tell them "that
'the dishonest official Is their enemy and the enemy of all decent people.
They are trying to fool you by a pretense of friendship and they are trying
to fool' you by abusing me. When they tell you that I am under the dom
ination of any organisation . hostile to labor they lie, and they know they lie.
"I am not under anybody's domination and I defy my enemies to pro
duce one particle of evidence to the contrary. If I have any standing
In this campaign it is because I intend to give everybody a square deal,
and that means the poorest laborer as well as the richest merchant.
- .'. "I am not making any bid for anybody's vote. I haven't asked a man
to vote for me yet, and I'm not going- to do so. But I have many close
friends among the laboring men of this city, and I don't want them to be
led astray by any. falsehood so that they will, lose faith in me.
I KNOWS HOPES AND TRIALS OF TOILERS.
"I have always" had to work hard for my own living and ' I - don't want
any man who .works to think I would not treat him fair and square. .Never
1 \u0084- since I- was 15 years old have I had a dollar that I didn't earn.- and I
know the hopes. and fears, the needs and longings of the men who toll
as one, who - has learned in the hard school of experience.
."My life has not been an easy one. It has been much hard work and
\u25a0 little recreation, and my heart goes out to those who have to toil.
Search my record as a teacher In this city and see If you can find one
single Instance where I made the slightest distinction between the child of
the richest and the son of the poorest folk. Go ask the worklngmen who
have. come to ray office in the last 3even years arrd see If I ever refused to
try a case for the poorest of them because he could not pay me a fee. If
youflnd any such then say I am not sincere. But If you cannot then be
lieve me when I*tellyou that I have always been in favor of a fair day's
'work and good, fair, pay and reasonable holidays."
Mr. Partridge paid high compliment _to the worth of his . associates :
on, the -fusion, ticket,, mentloningveach and setting forth the strong char- *
acterlstlcs of every candidate* who > is in the fight. to redeem San Franclscol
.' ; % "lti3 important to elect good mcD to. office," he continued, - "but It Is
equally, important; to -keep them there. And I will say for myself that I j
don't want, to be Mayor unless these men on the fusion ticket are elected.
There is nothing In this fight for me unless I can carry out my plans for
the. city's, welfare and for the defeat of the grafters. That I cannot do If
the other offices are filled with men I cannot trust. I can put good men
;on .the" commissions, but tfiey. can accomplish nothing if . .they have to

owned by a 'political boss.' I want the whole city government to be in

French Papers Say Britain
Made Overtures for Firm
Alliance Agaiiist Germany
PARTIAL DENIAL MADE
Again Reported That a War
Was Barely Averted in the
Difficulty Over Morocco
PARIS. Oct. 13.â The French Govern
ment continues silent concerning the al
leged revelation of Great Britain's offer
Of naval and military aiu to France If
Germany assumed a belligerent attitude
over Morocco. In the meantime the news
papers add new phases to the disclosures.
The Figaro gives a detaUea version even
more sensational than the previous dis
closures of the Matin. It says" that the
previous report of Great Britain offering
to mobilize her navy and land British
troops in Germany is not correct. It gives
the following version: '" â¢
"Before the Moroccan crisis became
acute the British Government made three
distinct overtures to learn if France was
disposed to conclude a treaty of de
fensive alliance. France declined to con
s.'der the question. Later, when the Mo
roccan crisis became acute, Paul Cam
bon, the French Embassador to Great
Britain, reopened the question and ob
tained a verbal assurance from Foreign
Secretary Lansdowne or Great Britain's
effective concourse in the event of a.con
flagration. M. Cambon was thereupon
able to answer M. Delcasse (who was
then Foreign Minister) that a 'causes
foederis' (case coming within a\ treaty)
was desired Great Britain would reiterate
her assurance In writing.
"The German Embassador in London,
Count Wolff-Metternich, learned of these
assurances and informed Berlin. Em
peror William decided on a counter move
and made Italy the medium of its ex
planation. He informed Italy that any
treaty whereby Great Britain gave
France military support relative to Mo
rocco would constitute a casus belli."
The Figaro asserts that this amounted
to an indirect ultimatum and. that the
Italian Government communicated the
situation to M. Berrere, the French Em
bassador to Italy, who Informed Paris
on June 4. Immediately thereafter M.
Delcasse resigned (June 6) as a result of
a violent scene in the Cabinet council.
During this council M. Delcasse is al
leged to have said: "I have a formal as
purance of Great Britain's support."
Premier Rouvler Is reported as answer-
Ing: "And I hava M. Berrere's telegram
proving that this means war if we con
tinue our policy. I refuses to indorse
what you seem to treat so lightly."
The other Ministers are said to have
upheld M. Rouvler, whereupon M. Del
casse resigned.
Later a semi-official note was issued
saying that the published reports upon
the Incidents accompanying ;:ie resigna
tion of M. Delcasse and notably the de
tails regarding the Cabinet council pre
ceding his resignation were incorrect.
COLOGNE, Oct. 13.â The Cologne Ga
zette prints another spirited^ dispatch
from Berlin apropos of the Figaro's de
nial to the Matin's story, , which can only
be Interpreted as . a plain hint to the
British, Government- to explain Its role
In the matter. The dispatch notes that
while the Matin's version, which gave
ground for the assumption that the sug
gested alliance of France with Great
Britain against Germany had an official
character the Figaro's version confirms
the assumption by giving the names qf
the parties, and says that this makes the
case against M. Delcasse all the stronger.
The mention of the name of Lord Lans
downe, the British Foreign Secretary, in
connection with the matter sheds upon
the story an embarrassing light for Great
Britain, according to the dispatch. The
dispatch says: *Â» â¢
It is exceedingly. offensive to us to see Brit
ish ftatemnen like' Premier Balfour and For
eign Secretary Lanedowne capable of such a
game, but if the revelations are repeated and
remain uncontradicted, one cannot avoid grow
ing- more and 'more Sceptical about the matter.
If the Matin and the Figaro are in the
right, the dispatch says, Delcasse, after
having reached an understanding with
Great Britain, was shaping his policy for
war with Germany and when a question
of such importance is once raised it can
not remain unanswered or unsolved. The
dispatch goes on to point out that neither
the British nor the French Government
has hitherto shown a disposition to come
forward with explanations, 'while the
semi-official note regarding the matter is
Insufficient. The Paris noce Is regarded
as inadequate and- calculated to increase
rather than allay suspicion.

being unknown to his arsailant. From all we
met with the same direct, straightforward
treatment as at home, and experienced no dif
ficulty from the Orientals. .
I believe there It a market here for American
goods, but they should be handled by Ameri

should closely follow the styles ami quality of

here will be a gradually increasing trade be

COTTON LEAK
NETS BIG SUM
NEW YORK. Oct. W.-^The profits of
the alleged conspirators, in the operations
based on the recent leak in the Govern
ment cotton crop reports are placed at
approximately $200,000. according to an
indictment presented in court to-day on
the arraignment before . United States
Commissioner Rldgway of Frederick A.
Peckham and Moses Haas. According to
charges made in this lndictment,"^Edwln
S. Holmes Jr., assistant statistician , of

as against Haas .and Peckham, and
charges all collectively with having con
spired to defraud by procuring advance
information from Holmes concerning the

SCHMITZ THE SPEAKER
Nominee for 3layor Heard at
Three Meetings Last Night
Despite His Hoarse Toice
That the Union Labor party is making
a determined fight in this .municipal cam
paign is "evidenced . by\ the fact that it
is holding more meetings;; than ever be
fore in its history. At ":each of I these
meetings every candidate for office, from
the Mayor to the last man who appears
on the list, appears and addresses -the
audience for a few minutes. Mayor
Schmitz is proving to be a good cam
paigner. He speaks at three or four
meetings each night with. all the vigor
that he possesses and although his voice
is weak, from, the continual strain,'; he
does not hesitate, but continues his fren
zied efforts .to bring the ; voters of . San
Francisco to- take stand under his "ban
ner."- ' -\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0;\u25a0. =1; ['; .-, .*\u25a0 \u25a0 ..* *' --'
Last night hÂ© addressed three meetings
In widely separated districts of the city.
The first was at Steimke Hall, his home
district, the Forty-first, where a large
crowd wa& in attendance. At the mu
nicipal campaign two years ago Mayor
Schmitz lost this district by 275 votes,
but last night he expressed himself as
confident that when the total vote was
counted this year he would win by SQO
majority. This meeting was presided
over by M. J. 80110.
The largest and by far " the most en
thusiastic meeting of the evening' was
held at Apollo Hall, 810 Pacific street,
Forty- fourth District. Joseph Pallerini
was the chairman and introduced the
speakers. In . the course of his \u25a0 re
marks Mayor Schmitz said:
My opponents are making a campaign upon
absolutely lalse Usues In this campaign. They
brousht.. these false issues Irom the East and
they are for the use of those who do not 'think.
The Issue of this campaign Is only one and
that Is clearly defined. It Is not Kraft. It Is
not reform. It Is a question as to whether the
Citizens' Alliance or the Labor Union will sur
vive. How can any honest man ask for a
change of administration? The present admin
istration has been prosperous. The prosperity
of to-day Is due directly to the Union Labor
party and the Union Labor administration.
At Montgomery Hall, Second and Fol
som streets, a good-sized crowd of men
and boys was gathered.- Here the Mayor
discussed the, issues of the campaign
and urged the men to vote the ticket
straight.
The voice of the Mayor is holding out
only moderately well under the strenu
ousness of the campaign. He was quite
hoarse last night. So was the Pierce
quartette.

SEATTLE. Oct. 13.â James Murray of
San Lorenzo, Cal., is believed to have
murdered his partner, James Fisk. last
March at Halibut Bay, near Seldovla.
Alaska, while insane. The skeleton of
Fisk was found by natives last week,
with a rifle ball In the back. It was
identified by clothing and letters found
on the body. In a cabin twenty steps
away were found a bloody razor and a
knife, and there were blood stains on
the furniture. Murray is supposed to
have committed suicide, as he was never
s-eon after his boat left Seldovia last
February.
The men were together on the inlet
every year. In the cabin seven letters,
written by Murray, were found. One was
to a sister, Mrs. F. S. Tenzel of San Lo
renzo, Cal. Another to an unnamed
brother says: "I have agreed Fisk
should kill me to-day at 5 o'clock, and he
is to be killed after me by my agency.
AH this is for wrongs in . our past lives
and for the sake. of humanity. We have
agreed to wipe out all scores of the past
in a sane and friendly way, so that In
doing this we forgive one another as well
as forgive our enemies."
Fisk hafl several hundred dollars and
Murray a considerable amount. None of
it was found. .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, Oct. 13.â A large crowd of peo
ple at Carson City were held at bay this
afternoon by a half-tamed Indian dog
an"d several men were severely bitten by
the animal. 'The dog was standing guard
over its mistress, a Piute squaw, who
fell violently on the stone sidewalk and
fractured her skull. The ' dog was the
primary cause of the squaw's injury. It
became engaged in a fight with another
dog. and in trying to separate the two
the squaw was upset, the back of her
head striking the sidewalk. The faith
ful canine, seeing his mistress lying pros
trate* and apparently lifeless on â¢ the
ground, ceased its row with the other
dog and, rushing to the squaw's side, re
fused to allow any one to approach her.
Several men who came too near to the
angry canine were badly bitten. Finally
the dbg was lassoed by a cowboy and
dtagged away.

GRAND OPERA'S
MAGICAL NICHT
"Otello" at the Tivoli
- Proves a Creation /)f Rare
Powers of Enchantment
SALASSA IS WONDERFUL
Polacco's Superb Orchestra
Delights, With Petrella and
Angioletti as Great Stars
Bravo, Polacco!
Bravo Salassa!
Bravo, bravisslmo.
Maestro Verdi! Last night your "Otello
was heard for the first time in San Fran
cisco. Last night was heard at the Tivoll
for the first time the noblest of modern
operas. For no performance of "Otello"
heretofore given here begins to count.
Plucky as they have been, surprisingly
good considering the resources, one asks
only to forget them after last night's.
A deadly thins is a skeleton orchestra
battling with the sound leffions of
"Otello"! How particularly deadly It ia
only the instrumental magnificence dis
closed In last night's performance fully
reveals. >You may pore over the score,
glue your spiritual ear to Its suggestion,
good. But. until you get the thing poured
through the flutes, blared madly through
the trumpets, flung alive at you from
the fiddle bows, you don't get it. Last
night we did get it and an electrifying
affair it was. Several effective instru
ments were added to Mr. Polacco's Noble
Fifty: add Polacco to these. Polacco at
hig highest power, and no more need be
said.
"Otello" i 3 as modern as this morning's
newspaper. Puccini in "La Tosca" is no
more modern, but Puccini in his inven
tion is as an old. old man compared with
this efDorescent youth of 80. He is here
as fruitful of themes as Schubert, as
tensely dramatic as Puccini himself, and
with an imperial splendor of orchestra
tion all his own. Wizard Verdi!
I don't think Verdi would have en
joyed the fashion in which his score was
smashed in two last night in the first
act. Ansjiolettl walked on. turned on a
high note, and smash went Verdi's score
in the unseemly racket. They did It
again at the close of the Angiolettl and
Petrella \u25a0 duet. For Mr. Verdi Polacco
turned round here and put up an in
dignant fistâ l think he wanted to use it!-
An educated claque would certainly have
its advantages.
Salassa of course was the chief fact
of the vocal end of the performance. Sal
assa with the voice like old wine, like an *
Amati "cello, like the sunlight in Sep-"*
tember. One could hardly have hoped
that he could still so fulfil the exactions
of the role, but the old maestro was in'
magnificent trim. Never did he sing bet
ter. One forgave the excited demand for
more after the "credo," and could only
join, hand and heel, in the tumult that
followed the duet in the second act. As
to acting Salassa's lago stands with such
portraits as Goritz's Beckmesser still
! stands right here.
Mr. Angioletti sang an excellent Otello.
and displayed quite unsuspected dramatic
fire. His clear, strong ringing voice suits
the role to perfection. One could not but
irreverently wish that his garb a little
less suggested (as all Otello's) a parlor
loungeâ the installment kind. Petrella
sang a very charming Desdemona. pos- \u25a0
' sibly her best -vocal role this season, and
! eloquent on the -dramatic sitfe. : Grass*' n*.
f rich note was useful a3 Emilia, and Za-
I vallo's pretty voice was heard agreeably
in the Cass!o.
Next Friday night the opera will be
given again. Never mind the rentâ just
go. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.

Comes to an
End.
WOOSTER, Ohio, Oct. 13. â Judge
Eason. who heard the divorce case of
Captain Ehnore F- Taggart against his
tvife, rendered his decision this after
noon. .The -court grants Captain Tag
yart the divorce and the custody of the
two children. Culver, aged 11, and
Charles, aged 7. Although Mrs. Tag
grart is denied the possession of the
Children, she will be permitted to see
them.
Captain Taggart was in court during
the reading of the decision. Mrs. Tag
gart is ill and was not present. The
courtroom was crowded with an eager
ly expectant throng of people. Judge
Eason. before giving his decision, re
viewed 1 the petitions, cross-petitions,
answers and affidavits. The charge of
drunkenness against Captain Taggart,
the court said, was not sustained.
The trial lasted seven weeks. The
case went to the court a month ago.
The suit was rirst started in July. 1904,
by Captain Taggart, who filed a peti
tion for divorce, charging his wife with
conduct unbecoming a wife and alleg
ing the excessive use of intoxicants.
He charged that she had been unduly
Intimate with Lieutenant Fortescue, a
cousin of President Roosevelt; Colonel
Miner and other prominent army offi
cers.
Mrs. Taggart heard of the proceed
kArgs in San Francisco several weeks
and immediately started for Woos
ter, the home of the Taggarts, where
Â£he filed a counter-petition for divorce
against Captain Taggart on the
grounds of cruelty and neglect.
Captain Taggart is a well-known
army. officer, lie is a graduate of West
Point and has served at various army
posts. He was commissary officer of a
division in the Cuban campaign, aided
In the relief of the Cubans, served with
distinction In the Philippines, especial
ly in Samar; was Chief of Police of
Manila and commanded the hospital
Ehip Relief and the transport Sherman.
Culver, the oldest child of Captain
and Mrs. Taggart, declared to his moth
er to-night that no matter what the
court decided he would rather remain
â¢with her. This afternoon, before the
decision of the court was announced,
tbÂ« -child went to his mother and said:
â¢Mamma, I don't have to leave you,
do I?" â¢
The Taggart home is being watched
to-night because of a fear that the
children might be kidnaped.
It has been reported that several offi
cers will have to face court-martial
proceeding's as a result of the disclos
ures during the trial.
Judge Eason began his decision at 2
p. m. He finished reading it at 10:20 to
night, with but one hour for supper in
tervening. The decision states that the
charge against Mrs. Taggart had been
proved in four different cases. V.
There is a provision in the decree that
If Captain and Mrs. Taggart can agree
wen a disposition of the children satlsfac-
to themselves other than that held
fey the court they are permitted to do so,
put. if not. the children are to be under
the care of their father.

STRANCE MOVE
BY BONAPARTE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLBJO, Oct. 13.â The sensation of
the week at the court-martial of Com
mander Lucien Young of the Bennington
was the making public of a telegram re
ceived at Mare Island this morning ap
pointing Lieutenant Commander F. W.
Bartlett, who has been . the expert wit
ness for the prosecution.^as Junior coun
sel to assist Judge Advocate West in the
prosecution of. Young. Bartlett is far
from pleased with the task which the
Secretary has given him and it is said
will urge that he is not well In order
to escape from an unpleasant duty.
Bartlett has been under a severe strain
ever since the Bennington disaster. He
was the senior member of the original
board of inquiry which convened at San
Diego and his labors at that time were
arduous. His duty there was not pleas
ant because of friction with. Naval Con
structor Holden A. Dvans, who was sent
to San Diego to examine into the con
dition of the Bennington. It is said
that it was not until the Bennington was
brought to Mare Island and Bartlett re
ceived an order from tne Navy Depart
ment itself was be able to have the
tests that he desired made by the navy
yard employes.
Bartlett has been on the witness
stand continuously since Tuesday.
He was nervous and overwrought
yesterday, but Evans had no mer
cy. At times Bartlett almost lost
control of himself as Evans, with a tech
nical text book in his hand, propounded
question after question on materials and
engineering. Bartlett gave up his at-
' tempts to maintain composure and paced
the floor like a . caged animal, but his
head was apparently clear, for not once
during the long and tedious ordeal was
Evans able to secure a point upon which
he could have all of Bartlett' s testimony
stricken out.
"It is likely that Bartlett will conclude
his testimony to-morrow morning.

MOURN DEATH
OF TROUBETSKOY
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 13.â The Rus
sian-press to-day expresses genuine and
hearty sorrow at. the death yesterday of
Prince j Sergius . Troubetskoy, the . fore
most Liberal in Russia and former presi
dent of the Zemstvo convention, whose
ability and sincerity were admired and
appreciated even among his strongest op-,
ponents. His death removes a restraining
influence over* Moscow students and may
cause the closing of the university.
Prince Troubetskoy's funeral will, take
place in Moscow. / .
Among his Moscow friends . Prince
Troubetskoy's death is compared to that
of Majorsl General Kondratenko, the "Rus
sian oSlcer who brilliantly distinguished
himself during the defense of Port Ar
thur, and his loss Is declared to be a
similar blow to the emancipation move

The students and professors of StJ

resolved to attend a requiem mass In a

Prince's funeral.
MOSCOW, Oct. 13.â Voicing the senti
ments of the extreme wing of the Russian
reformers, Maxim Gorky to-day express
ed sincere sorrow at the death of Prince
Troubetskoy as a man and a Russian, but
declared that Russia had nothing to
hope from the reported activities of such
men! as Prince Troubetskoy. He added:
I regard Prince Troubetskoy an a franlc, JuÂ»t
and honeÃt man, not as a representative of the
L4b?ral party, which cannot ever effect reforms
In Russia. Tbe ancestors of Troubetskoy
Galltzln and Oolovin went band in hand with
Imperialism. The taint 1b still In tha blood."
They are incapablÂ© of reallrln* their splendid
opportunities to know and . further the needs
of tbe people. The revolution \u25a0will come, soon,

BRIGHT CROP REPORTS
Railroads Appear Unable ;to

of Freight Offered Them
NEW YORK. Oct. 13.â Bradstreet's to
nibrrow will nay:
"Cool weather, later than usual. ln ar
riving this year," has given a ; stimulus . to
retail trade throughout a wide area, and
helped the already active jobbing trade
through the medium of re-orders. ; Export
trade in all kinds of grain and flour show
expansion. Prices of nearly all.commodi
ties are strong or tend upward, reflecting
insistent demand. Demand for money Is
\u25a0till growing and stock market; move
ments are being subordinated to require
ments to move crops and finance com
mercial operations along all lines. Some
"Western centers atill report their .. banks
drawing down Eastern balances ito meet
nearer requirements.
"The only flaw in the situation at pres
ent â one, by the way, flowing - from in
tense activity in all lines of industry
is the growing inability of the railroads
to handle the freight traffic offering. Thia
complaint la well nigh universal. .:
"Railway gross earnings in September
were very heavy, "\u25a0increasing -6 per cent
over the same ' month In 1904, while for
the nine months' of the calendar "year
the gain over j the ' corresponding period
last year' reaches '6.4* per ' cent. Many of

last year, 45,541,964 in 1903 and 76,766,180 in
Â»1902."
Dun's Weekly Review of Trade to-mor
row will say:
"Recent mild weather might have been
expected to retard business, but freight
blockades and several similar conditions
testify to the ' contrary, and the last half
of the week brought a . seasonable . fall
in temperature. ; Higher rates for money
tend to prevent excess In Wall street,
yet there is no difficulty in securing
funds for mercantile undertakings. At
some cities fall trade has become more
quiet, first necessities being covered,
but : supplementary orders are confidently
awaited. The first interest in holiday
trade is noted, and this element prom
ises to supply unprecedented business this
year. Manufacturers are so fully occu
pied that contracts for early delivery
cannot be considered in most cases, and
the amount of business that will bo car
ried over Into 1906 will certainly, eclipse
all records. These sanguine prospects are,
confidently announced In several of the
leading industries, latest news from ; the
Iron furnaces and steel mills | beinpr no
tably gratifying. Crops were not sorl
ously injured* by tluT Trost.f and ."such a
small percentage of the year's r yield 'still
remains exposed to danger that agricul
tural results may be summed up as most
favorable. It Is; to be hoped tha.t large
crops will restore liberal exports, which
have made very poor comparisons of late,
for the last week at this port alone a
decrease of $2,857,145 being noted in com
parison ' with the same week laÃt year,"
while imports guined 52,664,185. Railway
earnings thus far reported for October
gained only .02 per cent over last year's
movement, but prices of securities were
but little Influenced by the bankers' ad
dresses urging conservatism. Demand for
hides is fully sustained, prices rising still
further on some varieties, but packers
are j â¢ sold up well into November, and
more remote purchases are not made be
cause of 'uncertainty regarding quality.
Several pronounced advances are noted
in foreign dry hides. '

Ivins, the Candidate for the
Office of Mayor. Says City
Should Regain Franchises
NEW YORK, Oct. 13.â The Republican
convention to select candidates for the
various offices In Manhattan and \u25a0 New
York County were ( held to-night. Be
fore the convention met the executive
committee of the county committee dls- -
cussed for two hours â¢ the Question
whether or not the county convention
would endorse District Attorney Jerome.
Although. there Is no official relation be
tween tho borough and county conventions
they are substantially the same and un
til the leaders, who made up the execu
tive committee, could settle the Jerom* i
question both conventions were blocked.-
Of the thirty-seven members of the ex
ecutive committee, a dozen were in favor
of Jerome and Insisted that he should
be renomf nated fox the ' office he now
holds. The balance of the committee was
bitterly opposed to his candidacy. As
no satisfactory arrangement could be ar
rived at. a message was tent to William
M. Ivlna, the nominee for Mayor, in
viting- him. to appear before the com
mittee and N express his views. IvlnÂ»
made a long speech in favor of Jerome,
saying that he was very anxious for the
selection of Jerome as his running mats,
in the campaign. A vote was then taken
on the proposition and It resulted In Z7
to 8 against Jerome's nomination.
On the call for nominations In the coun
ty t convention for District Attorney,
Charles A. Flammer was placed in nom
ination by Abraham Oruber. The men
tion as a candidate of William Travers
Jerome by R. K. Prentice set the con
vention in an uproar, but when %.ae roll
was called 'Jerome received only nine
votes against 237 for Flammer.
As the convention was about to adjourn
Ivlns, the candidate for Mayor, arrived
and was received with enthusiasm. Dur
ing his address Ivins said, speaking of
the question of municipal ownership:
I believe that every franchise that has lapsed
should at once be acquired by the city. I be
lieve that every franchise that has been 1 for
feited should be at once put out of the way- of
acquisition by the moat relentless pursuit of the
parties who acquired that franchise unright
eously. I believe that there should be no new
grants of franchises In perpetuity whatever.

LOGAN TELLS OF LOVE
Eloping Church Trustee Writes to Little
Ethel Cook's Mother.
OAKLAND. Oct. 13.â With bold ef
frontery, coupled with a whining cant,'
Henry A Logan, trustee of the First
Free Baptist Church, has written to
Sirs. Mary Ross, mother of Edith. Cook,
the schoolgirl with whom he eloped "Wed
nesday, asking for the parent's bless
ing upon him. Logan's written confes
sion of his guilt is saturated with* a
cheap, maudljn sentiment and an evident
utter lack of appreciation of the enormity
of ' his offense against religion,, his own
abandoned wife and child and the imma
ture -companion of his flight.
While the message breathes of love and
affection for the child, there la an ugly
implied threat contained in the confes
sion that' fairly chilled the weary and
despondent mother. Logan warns Mrs.
Ross to be still, promising he will hold
her daughter inviolate as long as the
mother shall hold her peace.
As If to add misery, Logan writes that
he was compelled to leave, the implica
tion being strong that domestic difficul
ties might have been at the bottom of
the flight. Buf friends of Mrs. Logan
indignantly deny that she was in any
wise responsible for her husband's un
faithful conduct. Fortunately for her
self ar.d child, she has relatives, to whom
she can go for succor. Logan left her
without a cent, having wittiheld his
month's salary in preparation for his de
parture.
At the foot of the first page of Logan's
letter were the words. "If you want to
hear from," but a pen line had been
drawn through them and a portion of the
sheet of paper cut off as if the writer
had intended to give an address, but on
second thought decided not to reveal one.
The body of the letter Is in one style
of handwriting while there was a change,
in the last few lines. There was evi
dence of revision and the general ap
pearance indicated that Logan might
have had the help of Miss Cook In com
posing the sickly screed. The letter is
as fallows:
SEEKS TO E.VJOI.V SII-EXCE.
OAKLAND. Cal.. October 11, '05.
Mrs. Ross: I'lcnse read this very carefully.

my wife. You will be almost broken-hearted.
I know, but listen to me. I will take rood
care of her, for 1 love her. And if, when you
have thought this ail over and make up your,
mind that I can and will take good care of

track of you.
You win receive a letter from Ethel: Hop
ing you will trust your, once old friend, T who
will be true to the girt" he loves, I remain,
yours respectfully. H. A. LOGAN.
Iklrs. Logan declared to-day ehe had
received no word from her recreant
spouse. She has refused to talk concern
ing his absence or the cause of it. *
DETERMINED TO PROSECUTE.
The girl's mother "is determined' -upon
the apprehension of the runaways. First
she wants to recover her daugnter, then
to punish the man who led the young
Sunday school teacher astray. Mrs., Ross
repeated to-day her belief that the girl
did not Â«o of her own free will. She
added:
Freely will I forgive my child. She was
under -this man's influence. He had been rep â
rimanded at church for his attentions to the
young girls, but there was no thought that he
was evil. It was attributed to overzealous
ness in his religriou*- work- But this occurrence
chows how sadly mistaken we were in our
estimate of Logan's character. â¢ .
The police have - thoroughly satisfied
themselves that Logan and the girl
headed north. Chief- Ho&gklns said to
day he should exert all of the resources
of his department , to locate the elopers,
in view of the natiire of." the case".' The
church officials -will take action -to >deposÂ«
Logan from membership.

TRUE WRITES

BEHESTS TULAEE FOLK
Protest Against Abolishing
Branch of Agricultural
Department Is Considered
BERKELEY, Oct. 13.â Dr. A: C. True,
director of experiment stations in the
United States Department of^griculture,
has sustained Professor^E.^h" Wicksoh,
acting dean of the agriciilturedepartment
of the State , university, in his contro
versy with the citizens of Tulare County
, over the abandonment of the San Joaquin
Bub-experiment station at Tulare.
In pursuance of 'his policy to' centralize
; the organization for the- carrying, on ot
epecial . investigation in various parts â¢ of
1 the State and thus avoid the expense of
maintaining permanent sub-stations, Pro
: fessor Wlckson some ! time ago recom
mended .the r abandonment of the sub
| station at Tulare in the San Joaquin Val
ley. At once the citizens jof Tulare and
Kern counties, through the County Board
of Trade of. Kern County,; the County
Board of Trade and the Supervisors of
Tulare County, the Tulare City Board of
Trade and Tulare Grange sent a vigor
ous protest to the Regents -of the State
university. The Regents sustained Pro
i fessor Wlckson and the San Joaquin trade
' crganlzations at once carried their protest
! to Dr. A. C. True of the Agricultural De
' partment at Washington, D. C. In reply
to the letter of protest Dr. True writes
in Dart as follows: - \
â¢ I am thoroughly convinced that It ; will be
for the best interests of the San Joaquin
Valley and other agricultural regions of Cali
fornia to have the relatively small and in
efficient sub-stations abandoned and in- lieu
of these- to secure from the United States
and the State, and also from local communities,
funds -which can be expended for special in
vestigations pn different problems relatlnz to
the agriculture of particular regions.- ,^- *
Thl9 department is co-operating to a con
siderable extent with the California/ station
In investigations on irrigation and other sub
jects in California, and will continue to do
this as far as the funds appropriated by Con
gress will permit.
It seems to me, therefore, that Instead of
laying any stress on the continuance of the
sub-station at Tulare it would be- better to
aid the California station in securing funds
for the investigation on problems of special
importance to the agricultural Interest of the
San Jo&ciuln Valley.
In view, of this letter from Dr. True
it appears that Professor Wickson's edict
will be carried out and that the Tulare
sub-station will have to .be abandoned.

Pen of T. B. Eobertson
BERKELEY, Oct. I?.â As 'the result of
a number of j experiments which are still
in progress T. B. Robertson, an assistant
of Dr. Jacques Loeb ot tae \ University
of California, has announced a principle
whereby the actions of drugs such as
. nicotine and quinine may- be controlled
and modified by the administration with
them of appropriate saline ' solutions.
1 Should Mr. Robertson oDtam similar re
sults in the remarkable set of experi
ments which he is still continuing in the
; Rudolph Spreckels physiological labora
tory the action of. all drugs will be within
; the control of science and the medical
i practitioners , will have. been put in pos
session of principles that- will ~in a way
revolutionize modern methods. |
Robertson's experiments were begun at \
the suggestion of Dr. Loeb and have a i
tearing on the great biologist's investi
gations into the secret of the life prin
ciple. /
i ; In writing of his experiments Mr. Rob
ertson says: . . "\u25a0i^"*
â¢ It- is very- generally conceded that -the ac
tions of the alkaloids v upon life phenomena
are primarily due -to the formation of a com
pound between the alkaloid and some constit
uent of the protoplasm. Assuming that this
constituent is the- ion-proteld and that the* al
kaloid IÂ» only toxic .after it.haa combined,
then it seems probable that since all alka
loids possess, more or less pronounced basic
characters they should be more toxic when thÂ«
ion-proteld has an acid character than when
it hag a basic characterâ since - they would
more, readily combine with a molecule possess
ing acid propertiea than with one possessing
j baslo properties. Some alkaloids, however,
have both Dhenollc and baste characteristics
owing . to the uresence of one or more hy
droxyl groups as well as the unsaturated nl
troffen atom. Such alkaloids should .be toxic
both when the ton-pretoid is basic and* when
;it is acid. Since the basic and phenolic char
| acters are not usualy present in the alkaloid
to an equal degree, however, the toxicity should
vary. In the epecial case in which the phe
nolic characters are pronounced the ion-pro
teld Is baalc and much less toxic .when the
lon-proteld Is add. - â¢ - ' \u25a0 â
The experiments on the action of nicotine
are of EDeclal Interest because of thÂ« local
ized action of nicotine upon certain parts of
the nervous system. Should our hypothesis
: turn out to be correct the ' action of nicotine
might be used to indicate the nature of the
ion-proteld in different parts of the nervous
: system.
The experiments upon the action of quinine
upon unicellular organisms are of special in
terest because of the importance of a thor

the action of quinine upon the plasmodlum

board.
The fourteen miles of planking through
te'hlch the steamer Chehalls, which ar-
Hved here the other day. passed came
from the schooner Sailor Boy, which
came into port yesterday from Grays
Harbor with a tale of as tough a fight
with the elements as ever coaster report
td. During the hurricane the schooner's
deck load was swept overboard and it was
part of this 7000 feet of lumber that the
Chehalis found strewed along fourteen
tniles of her way down the coast.
It was on October 5 at 8 o'clock p. m.
when the Sailor Boy was in latitude
4S degrees 35 minutes, longitude 125 de
grets 55 minutes that the trouble began
with a heavy blow from the east south
east, liie wind gradually drew around to
the â¢ southward and increased in velocity
Until 9 p. m., when it was blowing with
hurricar.e force. By this time the
echooner was down to double reefed
mainsail. The foresail was split when an
tttempt was made to take it in.
At 1 o'clock a. m., October 6, the main
eheet chain carried aw*y and the main
boom snapped. Every ribbon of can
vas 'uy this time had. been blown away
end the schooner, except for the spanker,
was under bare poles and at the mercy of
eea and wind.
As she wallowed in the trough of the
waves three of the deck-load lashings
parted, the deck load shifted to star
board and then slid overboard. The
lumber went through the spanker, burst-
Ing the sail and mast hoops. The gale
continued until sunrise, but It was forty
hours from the time the blow began un
til the vessel was again under mainsail
&nd jibs.
The Saijor Boy was eleven days ccm-
Ing from Grays Harbor. She reached
port with 360,000 feet of lumber.
Was ln Terrific Storm.
The British tramp steamer Agincourt, Cap
tain T. H. Worsnop, arrived yesterday - from
H&kcdate with 4400 tons o: sulphur. - The
Agincourt was built on the Tyiie in 1904, but
ln scite of her youth has been wrecked ence
and nearly destroyed another time. She wu
wrecked on her maiden voyage. She carried
coal from Barry io Nagasaki and on her way
trora the Japanese port to India was driven
Ashore north of Hongkong. She stranded on
the only strip of sandy beach Tor miles." ShÂ»
was floated and in about six months was in
commission again, good as ever. She was an
chored off the Woo Eung lighuhip September
1. when a fierce north easterly squall struck
her. This was at 6 o'clock in the morning.
She dragged her anchor and at 9 o'clock ran
Into Woo Sung. There both anchors were let
go and all day and all eight ehe lay with a
big head of steam and the engineers standing
by the engines, ready for any emergency. The
\u25a0wind had changed to northwest and ln epite of
both anchors the Agincourt drifted shoreward
until her heel nearly touched the beach. No
attention was paid to the freighter's signals of
distress. Captain Worsnop decided to run out
to sea. He found both anchors had fouled the
cable.. The pilot advised him that the eabl*
company would compensate him for the loss of.
his anchors if he slipped them instead of break-
Ing the cable. Two anchors and thirty fathoms
of chain "were therefore left on the bottom of
Woo Sung harbor and the Agincourt steamed
away.
The French mail steamer Lorraine was -in
plight similar to the Agincourt's. . Time was
prrclous with the Lorraine and she nÂ«>eded her
anchors so "he .sacrificed the cable. The Agin
court was' blam*"d for breaMng the cable and
\u25a0will have to wait for compensation until the
cable ccmp&r.y makes a eubmaxir.e Investiga
tion.
In that same storm Woo Sung and Shanghai
were flooded and local shipping suffered se
verely, - '
The chief officer of the Agincourt is H. Sims,
who was last here as mate of the British ship
Cragimore, which was laid up so long at
Eausaiito.
Bloody Battle on the Greenwood*
All hands and the cook of the steam schooner
Greenwood were drunk yesterday afternoon and
the Idltrs and longshoremen on Mission-street
wh&xf were entertained for about fifteen mln
ctes by cne of tbe goriest sailor fights that
ever crimsoned the 'deck of a coaster. Every
body seemed to have a grudge against every
body else. Eyes were blackened and knuckles
skinned. Rules were suspended. Sometimes
four sailors danced on the face of one prone
shipmate. .The tide oi battle would turn and
one lone Norseman would drive all hands be
fore him. There was nothing serious about
the affair until Victor Oksa remembered that
"William Redell, the steward, had once served
blm with cold coffee. Victor unsheathed a
keen edged knife and buried part of the blade
in the fctarboard side of the steward's neck. In
the struggle which followed all hands Joined
and when the police .arrived net a man aboard
the Greenwood but was smeared with crimson
Kfcre. Oksa's thumb wes nearly severed and
â¢eversJ others suffered incisions, contusions and
&br&sionÂ£ galore.
Just berore the battle, Victor Oksa discarded
a clean, white canvas cap. In the expectaflon
of extensive trouble he laid it in the scup
pers and placed a box over It. As the Harbor
police were dragging the blood-stained mariner
across the deck, be made a gtganttc effort and
\u25a0hook himself clear of the biuecoats. He rushed
to the ecupper, -.carefully lifted the box and
picked 'up his Â«now-white cap. He carefully
smoothed "out the \u25a0wrinkles. He set the cap
Jauntily on- his 'tumbled tresses and stepped
up to the policeman, saying:
\u25a0â¢Aye tank ay batter go to yail."

MAKES CHARGE
OF CONSPIRACY
Widow/ of Late Simon H.
Seymour-Objects to Partial
Distiibution of the Estate
WILL FILE A CONTEST
Says Collateral HeirSyHave
Agreed fo Stand Together
and Share Judgments
A conspiracy to secure possession of
$240,000 dutside of their legal share of
the estate of the late Simon H. Sey
mour Is -charged against August H. V.
Kordmeier, Henrietta; F. Eckhardt, the
two children of Louisa Hebrack and
the seven children of Henry Kordmeier
in an answer filed yesterday by, Susan
C.Jseymour, widow. of the deceased, to
the petition of Henrietta < F. Eckhardt
etal., for partial distribution of de
cedent's estate. -The petitioners . are
nieces .and nephews of the deceased,
and to them Seymour conveyed the bulk
of his estate before his death by deed
and by his will, giving Mrs.- Seymour
only half of a piece of property in Los
Angeles,- which, he said, was the only
community property in his large estate.
MrsJ Seymour first protests against
the petition, for distribution on the
ground- that she purposes filing a con
test to her deceased husband's will in
the near, future and that'lf the'peti
tion is granted it might operate to'de
feat her interests and react as a great
injustice upon her. Furthermore, she
says, the. petitioners are. not heirs at
law of the deceased, and . that their
claim that the estate is unincumbered
and ready for distribution is not true.
She next; points to suits that have
been instituted by August-H. V. Kord-';
meler; to recover possession of 800
shares of Spring Valley Water stock,
valued: at $40 a share, some $50,000 in
the Bank of California and real .and
personal , property, bringing r the total
valuation of his claims up to $240,000.
And supporting him In his suits, she
says, are the collateral heirs of the de-.
ceased. They are supporting him, she
says, by reason of an agreement among
them that amounts to a conspiracy
that in ;. event he recovers Judgment
they will divide the spoils of the. liti
gation to -her exclusion and Inestima
ble damage.
She further purposes demanding a
homestead upon property of the de
ceased claimed by the collateral heirs,
she says, and demands that the estate
be left intact until her interests have
been finally determined. She further
asserts that j half of the entire estate
of the- deceased belongs to her byyvir
tue of her community rights, claiming
that Seymour acquired all of hia
wealth after he married her in 1578.,
; In the contest to the will she pur
poses instituting she will charge that
relatives of the deceased poisoned" his
mind against her, and, : further, that

Collector Lynch Explains
How He Made Up Deputy's
Apparent Shortage Fully
United States Internal Revenue Col
lector John C. , Lynch testified yesterday
in. the United States District Court as to
what he knew of the charges against his
former , chief deputy, George A. "Wright.
He emphasized his testimony on the cross
examination by Bert Schlesinger and
Samuel M. Shortrldge. It was to the
effect that he knew of the offers of com
promise having . been : made by persons
who had violated the revenue laws. He
said further that when Revenue Agent
Bert M. Thomas "\u25a0\u25a0 reported to him that
there i was an apparent shortage ln the
office he instructed . Mr. Wright to ren
der Agent Thomas all the Assistance ln
his power ln examining tha accounts. He
knew also that Mr. Wright had furnished
the agent with a list in his own hand
writing of the offers of compromise that
had been received by him. The total of
the apparent shortage was $4252, and when
this .total had been ascertained the money
was paid into the treasury to the account
of Collector Lynch. '
In response to "a question* as to where
the money had. come from. Mr. Lynch
said that Wright's father had given him,
a note for-the amount. Of the total men
tioned, the sum of $1667 was paid to the
Internal Revenue Collector of the, district
ln Kentucky In which had been manu
factured a consignment of whiskey that
had been . reimported from Manila.
Mr. Thomas was recalled for cross ex
amination and admitted that on Novem
ber 3, 1904, Collector Lynch had announced
that he was ready to make the deposit of
$4252. He testified further that deposits
in the United States sub- treasury from
Lynch's office, were always made ln the
name of Collector Lynch .and not in the
name of the deputy who received the
money.
Mr. Thomas admitted also that he had
not found any erasures or alterations in
Wright's accounts, that Wright had ex
clusive access to the vault ln which were (
stored large, quantities of revenue stamps
of great value, and that no stamps or
other â¢ property was missing. He added
that Wright had been promoted from the
position of cashier to that of chief deputy.
The trial will be resumed at 11 a. m.
next Monday.

PUBLICATION' OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
SATURDAY OCTOBER 14, 1905
THE GRAFT ORGANS.
THE graft campaign which the Mayor is making in behalf of Mr.
Ruef is furnished out with organs and a literary bureau. The
latter empties its contents into the outside press. Its work is
interesting because of its elaborate, skillful and plausible lying. In
its last effort the bureau finds discontent operating against Mr.
Partridge among the rich people of San Francisco.
To make out this case the bureau reports a conversation with
a rich merchant, who is made to talk like this: "I am not going to
support Mr. Partridge. We have been deceived. Mr. Fairfax Whee
lan came to us and promised if we would give money to the Repub
lican League and vote its ticket at the primaries he would see that
the convention nominated a millionaire for Mayor." One is at a
loss to account for the publication of such stuff. No one in the re
form ranks has thought of making any distinction between rich and
poor on the ticket, or in the government of the city.
It may be that the story is intended to make it appear that the
rich people and business men are being stampeded from Partridge,
or it may be that the Schmitz literary bureau desires to discredit
Fairfax Wheelan in resentment of his prosecution of the ballot box
snifters. Whatever its motive, it is merely lying, and somewhat
idiotic. , ,
An organ of the administration has discovered that Mr. Bryan,
who was in the city at that time, refused to make a speech to the
Democratic convention because he is opposed to fusion! This
story was elaborated in great detail by the Ananias department of
the organ, and was intended to drive Democrats away from the fu
sion ticket. But it is to laugh. Mr. Bryan has been the most per
sistent fusionist in American politics. He was the fusion Demo
cratic, Silver Republican and Populist candidate for the Presidency
in iBy6, and was voted for in this State by the members of all thosr
parties.
In 1900 he was again the fusion nominee of the Democrats and
Populists and accepted both of the nominations. The organ believes
that the people have forgotten these things, and that a Democratic
vote might be picked up here and there by lying. The fact probably
is that Mr. Bryan if asked to consider the matter would have taken
another view entirely. Whatever one may think of his politics, he
is personally a clean and decent man, and is a sincere believer in
virtuous and honest government. As such he would be sure to
approve a union of the decent men of all parties to compel Mr. Ruef
to take his snout and hoofs out of the trough. While people may
distrust Mr. Bryan's political principles, his personal principles and
moral point of view are those of the best citizenship, and were he a
citizen of San Francisco it is entirely probable that he would be
found supporting Mr. Partridge and the joint ticket, and opposing
Mayor Schmitz in his campaign for Ruef.
Just why the organ should Ananias in such a matter is a mys
tery, explicable only by the straits in which Mr. Ruef findslhis cam
paign. He has the impudence to proclaim himself the simon pure
Lincoln Republican. Lincoln is dead and defenseless, but- his shade
must be reminded of a story by this aspersion of his memory. The
joint ticket is supported by the bone and sinew of both parties, and
cannot be conjured against by organic lying about Mr. Bryan's po
sition.
Come what may, Mr. Ruefs hold on the Republican party is
broken and it remains for both parties by joint action to bane him
out of control of the city government. His position is most revolt
ing, for he occupies the place of a political flea to the Mayor, a para
site who gets all the sustenance while the Mayor does the scratch
ing. The voters of this city do not feel called upon* to keep a Mayor
as fodder for Mr. Ruef. He is a sort of San Jose scale on city affairs,
and Californians have learned how to deal with scales, in politics
as well as in horticulture.
It is done by combining to fight the parasite. That is just what
Bryan- would advise Democrats to do, and President Roosevelt would
give the same advice to Republicans. It is a time for killing para
sites and ending graft. The movement is in the air and San Fran
cisco cannot afford to stick in the mud, lag behind, carry her load,
of vice and sin, while other cities have gone forward, up the shining
highway to decency, order and law. ;> '
POPULATION AND PROSPERITY.
npÂ» HE Philadelphia Press has been making a study, of some of
I the State censuses for last year, and while finding a decided
* arrest of population does not see any reason for regret. It
makes note of the feature in immigration that is not often calculated
or mentioned, namely, that half the immigrants who come over go
back, and each year the proportion of those who return grows a
little bigger. Our national increase, which used to be about 25 per
cent in ten years, has now dropped to about 12 to 15 per cent in ten
years, and is little above that%of prosperous. European countries,
such as Germany and England.
The lowa census for this year shows that in five years the State
has lost in population 15,000. -This loss is wholly in the farming
districts and villages. The cities increased, but they could not offset
the big decrease in the country, which was 92,000. Minnesota's
census shows that whereas it used it grow at the rate of 33.7 per
cent in ten years, it now increases only at the rate of 13 per cent.
Its farming population has ceased to grow. That the decrease of
population is not confined to country districts is shown by the
census of Massachusetts. Making a comparison with its previoub
rate of growth this State, which principally consists of city and
town, shows it to be only one-half as prolific as past censuses led
expectation to count on. The prediction was 375,000 for the decade
ending 1905; the actual count was only 193,612. It is notable in the
case of Massachusetts that increase of prosperity, which was
abundant, had no effect in promoting population. This fact is a
distinct correction of the Malthus sociological dictum that by action
of the natural law increase of population would be consequent on
gain in prosperity.
If we must face the fact that the halt of population is to be one
of this new century's most notable features, there seems no reason
from present indications to fear evil from the. arrest. The Press
says: "The amount paid out in wages increases. The average
paid each worker grows. There is more comfort, more house, more
meat, more bread, more clothes, more shoes per person."

USUAL TOUGH.
Senator McEnery of Louisiana is as
deaf as a post. One day last session
one of the newspaper correspondents,
interested in Louisiana news, sent in a
card to him and Mr. McEnery came out
of the Senate chamber to see him. says
the; Philadelphia Ledger.
I "Any news? Senator?" shouted the
correspondent. -' . , - â¢:.~ \u25a0' \u25a0. '\u25a0;
"What's that?" \ said -Mr. McEnery.
\u25a0-"Any news to-day?" roared the cor
respondent, getting- purple.
"Don't near you," said the Senator.:
"I â say â isâ there^anyâ news?"
"Oh! Yes, I believe I have got one,"
mumbled Mr. McEnery, feeling in his
pocket. He pulled out a- cigar and
handed it to the newspaper man. The
latter, seeing the hopelessness of the
.case, accepted the cigar as the best
way out of the situation, expressed his
thanks in pantomime and went away.
Senator McEnery returned to the
Senate chamber and sat down beside
Senator Foster. "What do 'you think
of this for infernal cheek?" shouted he.
"Young Blank of the Palladium called
me out in the midst of this important

MlSTLETOEâ Subscriber, City. The
Druids in all ages held the mistletoe in
great veneration. The mystic uses of tha
plant has been traced to pagan agea. The
Loranthus Europoeus seems to be the
original or most common mistletoe of the
Greeks. It usually grows on some kind, of
fir tree. The Viscum album of the United
States Is also found in Greece, though
rarely growing on the oak, and this has
been preferred from the moat remote an
tiquities. Hence when the superstition of
the East traveled westward the Druids
adopted the idea that the mistletoe of
the oak was more holy or efficacious in
conjurations or medicine than that from
any other tree. The Druids call the plant
the heal-all.

Inspector Bulger questioned Pilot John
eon closely on what he considered the
Jurisdiction of a pilot "on board a vessel.
"When you were on board the vessel.
Cid you consider yourself Jn full charge?"
**&Â» asked.
"Yes, sir." replied Johnson.
"Up to the time of the accident?"
"I can't say; I am always under the
captain's orders."
"Then you were not in full charge."
"Ths captain is ahead of me at aÂ»y
tine."
"If you were bringing In a vessel un-
Cer enrollment would you take an order
frcm the captain?"
"If he gave an order that you did not
!ike would you surrender your oomr
ir.and?"
"If I thought* anything was wrong.
Captains are always interfering," added
the pilot.
"I want to find out," demanded In
spector Bulger, "if you consider yourself
in full charge of a vessel when the cap
tain turns her over to you?"
\u25a0Yes, until he takes her away from
me."
â¢'If you had continued on the couth
. west course without the whistle* blowing,
would you have ben able to get out all
right?"
â¢j^Yes, Â«lr. I think so."
PILOT SHIFTED COURSE.
"Â« hen you changed her course did
you act upon suggestion or upon your
own accord?"
"1 acted upon my own accord."
"At any time," asked Inspector Bolles,
"(]Â»d the master interfere in the naviga
tion of the vessel?"
"No, sir, not in directing her course?"
â¢When?"
"Only in starting and stopping, and In
Flowing up."
"Did you make any objection to slow
tog?"
"No, sir."
"Suppose that you knew you would not
have the fog whistles?"
"I should have got something else to ;
co by."
"Did the men in the ship obey your
. orders promptly?"
â¢ "Yes, sir."
"'Do you consider that the master was
hMping you all he could?"
"Yes, sir."
"Had you known that the fog signals
would not be sounded would you have
r.cted differently?"
\u25a0Yes, sir, I would have stopped the
vessel."
"Did Captain Dowdell give you any or
ders?" continued the Inspector.
"He told me that I had better slow
down and blow the whistle."
"Did you consider this as an order?"
Yea sir."
Pilot J. M. Hayes, who took the Ap
paiachee out on the same morning that
the Alameda grounded testified that he
b^erd no fog signals until after he
Ittrd the distress signals from the Ala
iWda. The Appalachee was off Point
Bonita when she heard the Alameda's
whistle.
FOG TRUMPET IS WEAK.
"Would you rely on hearing the Fort
Point Jog trumpet going out?" asked In-
Bpector Bolles.
"No, sir," replied Captain Hayes.
"Could you describe the sound of the
Fort Point trumpet?"
"It is very weak and sounds like a
sheep bleating." \u0084 ,
R. P. Harvey testified that he was com
ing in through the North Channel about
the time that the Alameda was going
cut. He was very uncertain about time
Â£nd declared that he did jpot hear, the
Alameda whistle though he thought he
heard the Fort Point trumpet.
He referred frequently to his mate who
v.as on the deck with him.
"We must have the mate here?" said
Inspector Bolles. "What's his name?"
"The mate is my wife," replied Har
\u25a0 vey.
P. J. ; Owens, Chief Engineer of the
A lameda, who was on deck from the time
the steamer started until she ran upon
the rocks, declared that he heard no fog
signals until she 6truck.

his topic, the difference that exists
between popular conception of plant
life and what that conception ought
to be. x'he speaker presented some
rather abstruse arguments, which were
nevertheless beneficial in -awakening
thought among the hearers. Professor
Menzel spoke of the closely allied re
lationship between animal and plant
life, explaining that elementally they
were Identical. Theories of noted
scientists, including Huxley and Bur
bank, were drawn from In the dis
course.

SANTA BARBARA, Oct. 13.â After, a

is entitled to a fourth interest in his
estate, consisting of about 10,000 acres of
oilland In Santa Barbara County, in the

does not end the litigation and the estate

tion unless there is an amicable settle
ment between: the heirs.

WINS COURT ACTION
Y. Thompson Is Induced to
Part With Money on Prom
ise of Getting Vineyard
The methods of the California Co-op
erative Land Company were placed in a
'questionable light . yesterday before , Jub
ticc of, the Peace Lawaon in the trial of
the suit of V. Thompson to recover |190
from the concern. The testimony, was of
such a : positive character against the
company, the promoters of which, it is
said, have : fled to Mexico to escape
criminal prosecution, . that Judge Lawson
gave judgment In favor of Thompson for
the full amount claimed.
â¢' Thompson took the .witness stand and
described how he had been mulcted
through the roseate promises contained
in the . circular issued by the company.
The circular, referred to such prominent
financial institutions as the Western Na
tional Bank, the Bank of California, Cali
fornia Promotion Committee, State Board
of 7 Trade and others > as indorsing the
scheme. : ' . ' : \ .-
Thompson said he was induced to in
vest his money as the result of the refer
ences quoted. He paid $160 down, and
was to pay $20 per month for four, years,
at the end of which time he was to come
into possession of a ten-acre vineyard in
what was ' termed as . tne "Las . Vlnas
Colony lands" In Sacramento County." ..
Thompson' became suspicions of ' the
concern after he parted . with $190. He
discovered that- the company had aban
doned its offices gat 720 Market street,
which were presided over, by two indi
viduals named Mead and Wallace.
Thompson experienced no difficulty in
proving that the references given by the
company were fraudulent and therefore
that his money had been seenred through
misrepresentation.
Among those who filed affidavits that
no authority had ever been given to the
company to use the names of the con
cerns given in the references were Wil
liam R. Pen ty, cashier of the Bank of
California, Arthur R. Briggs, secretary
to the State Board of Trade, Edward P.
Antron of the California Promotion Com
mittee, F. L. Holland, cashier of the
Western National Bank and the man
agers of Dun's and Bradstreet's, com
mercial 'agencies.
' The defendant company had spread cir
culars broadcast throughout the United
States and it Is said "that many people
in this city and elsewhere were mulcted
out of various sums on the promises
that a full bearing vineyard would be
come their property in time.
Where there is no heart in the work
there is always plenty of hardship.

HUNTERS SWARM TH E MARSH ES
DUCK SEASON WILL OPEN TO-MORROW UNDER FAVORABLE CONDITIONS
SPORTSMEN WITH DOGS AND GUNS MAKING READY . W CHARGE . FEATHERED ILOCKS
Good Sport Expected
on the Solano
Ivfnr slips
The duck season will open to-morrow
at eunrise and already the majority of
hunters who take delight in bagging the
leathered occupants of the marshes have
hied themselves to their favorite pre
serves, there to await the time when
they â¢will be allowed to wade in after their
prey. Conditions are not as favorable as
they might be on account of lack of rain,
but the sportsmen are hopeful and already
figure on bringing home limit bags the
first day out. '-â¢\u0084**â¢
As usual, the members of the Empire
Gun Club will do. their shooting on their
extensive preserves In Monterey County.
All the prominent members, including Dr.
Paine, J. B. Haver. F. S. Judah, J.
Sweeney, Con Roman, Dr. Sylvester, G..
Wayman, Frank Turpin and R. Peltier
are already on the ground. A full list
of the members will turn loose at the
signal to-morrow morning and some. good
t port 1b promised.
The members of the Field and % Tule
Club have already started for Cordelia,
where they will do all theft hunting this
season. The party is led by Alex Shields
and Al Cummlngs. Good sport ' Is pre
dioted there, though some of the members
are atill doubtful. -. â¢ - '- - \u25a0â¢- '<
The Noyo Club men go to their pre^
serve* near Burlingame, while the Lin
coln Club experts figure on a big time
at Reclamation, Sonoma County." where
they have extensive preserves. The
Alameda boys will shoot on the Sonoma
mar6hen, while the Family Club goes
to Suisun. The Point Reyes and Coun
try clubs are quartered at Point Reyes
and the Petalurna^ sharpshooters";' will'
hunt along Petaluma Creek.
Dry weather lias been worrying the \
marksmen for many moons past, and :
all are praying for rain bo the birds
will be stirred up a bit and fly to the
marshes. The bright moon is also a
bad orrien, as the ducks are likely to
keep out' in deep' water while: the sil
very beams remain so prominent.
\u25a0It is expected that the coming sea
son-will be a great one for wild geese.
Already flocks of these birds are said
to be hovering -around ready to come
in on the marshes as_ soon as the rain
starts. Many can vasbacks have also been i
"spotted in the waters of the bay. This i
Is exceptionally early for this specimen j
and the chances'are they will be plenti- {
ful in a short' time. -\u25a0â¢ ,i

There has often been much discussion
among the yachtsmen of San Francisco
Bay as-to just" what constitutes a cabin
yacht. The amended deed of gift of the
trophy presented by Sir Thomas Lipton to
the San Diego Yacht Club defines clearly
what a cabin yacht is in the. opinion of
the British yachtsman. It Is a sloop
rigged yacht having not less than j2O per
cent- of her sail area before' the t mast, a
cabin partitioned off from 'the rest of the
interior of the huil and constructed with
permanent bulkheads, trunk and \u25a0 com

be the first contest for the championship
and gold medal of the C. W. G. A., and
the first' match' between teams represent
ing Northern and Southern California. It
has â¢ not yet been -determined on what
course the tournament -will take place,
but probably on the new course of the
San Francisco Golf and Country Club at
Ingleslde, if that is Jn satisfactory con
dition, the course of the Ciaremont Coun
try Club if It, has by that time been ex
tended ;to eighteen holes. These will be
the only two eighteen-hole courses in
Northern California, and it is not thought
desirable to hold a championship event on
a nine-hole 1 links, suoh as the San Ra
fael and Presidio course.
; The great international golf foursome,
in which Harry Vardon and J. H. Tay
lor represented England, while James
Braid and Alexander Herd represented
Scotland, was by the Englishmen by
the large" margin of 13 ,, up 12 to play.
On the last of the four days' play at Deal,
England,.thâ¬j wind blew; with great force
and it was 4 supposed* that this would help
the Scotchmen,- who are physically power
fulmen. Vardon judged the strength and
direction of the 'wind exactly, pulling his
ball Into it 'so that he constantly drove
straight down the course, getting long
balls in addition. Both Englishmen play

This Morning in Lloyd
Loving Cup Tournament
Many tournament matches will be
played the Golden" Gate Park tennis
courts to-day and, to-morrow. Two events
will be started this morning, one a handi
cap singles tournament fory juveniles and
the other a scratch slngrCsfor the wo
men's championship of the bay counties.
To-morrow play will be resumed in the
men's tournaments for the championship
of the bay counties.
The women's tournament will be the
first annual- event of the kind and will be
for the Reuben H. Lloyd trophy. The
latter, like the one given by Mr. Lloyd
to the Golden Gate Club, is a hand3ome
silver loving cup \u25a0 which must be won
three times.- It was expected the event
would attract the best players from both
sides, of the bay and a large entry was
anticipated. Only- nine players-vafnxed
their signatures to the entry list and all
are members of the park organization.
Such players as Miss Ratcliffe, Miss
Hojtchkiss, ' Miss Hunter and Miss ' Val
leau .would have increased the class of
the tournament and enhanced the Interest
In it.
'Of the "nine players entered ) five are
evenly matched and have a good chance
to score the first win of the new-trophy.
They are : Mrs. Wattaon, Miss Mearns,
Miss Myer, Miss Crocker and Miss Vod
den. Mrs. Wattson last week won a
tournament in which the other. four play
ers mentioned received odds from her.
For this reason she is figured to have by
far the best chance to win.
Miss â¢ Myer Is probably the most prom
ising young lady player at the -park and
Is not without a chance of winning. Miss
Crocker and Miss Mearns played clever
tennis at. San. Rafael and are by no
means outclassed. . Play will begin at
&:30. â¢ \u25a0â¢- â¢ . -
The juveniles will meet in a > handicap
singles .tournament * for the , three-time
cup which has already been won, twice
by Morris McLoughlin. The .latter as
usual will be the .most heavily han
dicapped player and will probably carry
oft the honors once more.
The men's singles tournament for the
championship of the bay counties will
be finished to-morrow. Last Sunday's
play narrowed the competition down to
four players who will meet in the con
cluding rounds to-morrow. There 13 con
siderable, speculation as to who will suc
ceed Champion MacGavin, each of the
four remaining players being conceded a
chance to win. Percy . Murdock Is picked
by the majority to carry off the honors.
Murdock at ;hls I best undoubtedly put
classes â¢ the other three, but ', he, rarely
plays his best gairie; ?In the past-he has
always beaten Clarence Grlffln in straight
sets. The latter, In fact, has never been
able to make a showing against the Ala
meda 1 crack. \u25a0 . .
Many followers of the game at the park
figure lhat Charles Foley is playing bet
ter tennis than either Griffin or Mur
dock. He has been winning regularly of
late In practice, but has never done any
thing In past tournaments to warrant his
beating either of these players. He
played a splendid game in both singles
and doubles last. Sunday and if he lives
up to his practice , reputation ought to
furnish some good tennis In the finals.
Foley first meets Neil Baker in the
semi-finals, but the latter, despite his vic
tory over Charles Gardner last Sunday, Is
conceded little chance to beat Foley.
Baker can plajT better than he did when
he beat . Gardner, but Foley's style of
play, is different entirely from Gardner's
and Is calculated to break up Baker's
get-back game.
The doubles will be finished to the semi
finals at least. Whitney and Foley have
two matches. to play before reaching the
finals, but in both their opponents will
have no chance to win. *
In the lower half three good teams are
left They are Rolf e and Schmidt, Baker
brothers and Dunlap, and Gardner. The
first named teams will meet in the first
round > and \u25a0 the winner . will be opposed
to Dunlap and Gardner in the second
round. One of I these .three teams will
surely meet Whitney, and Foley in the
finals. .
The Claremont : Country Club Is ar
ranging an invitation doubles tournament
for the 4th and sth of next month.
Many of the "cracks from Alameda and
San Francisco counties : have been ; invited
to participate.' Several of the prominent
teams entered are Dr. Hill and Dr. Me-
Chesney, Dr. Sumner Hardy * and â¢ Harry
Haigh t, Percy Murdock and â¢R. T. Craw
ford and Frank Mitchell and. Grant
Smith.

Nine Teams Will Battle for

SCHEDULE NOT BEADY
Each Eleven Is Carded to
Play Two Games With the
Other for Final Honors
The schedule committee, consisting
of F. H. Lynch of the . Independents, ii
R. Bennett of the Eagles and A. W. Wilffg
Ing of the Vampires, presented a pro-1
gramme' of matches to be played foe*
the 1905-1906 championship of the Cali
fornia Association Football League at
the meeting on Wednesday night, but
as two more clubs have joined the
league, the programme needs recon
struction. The. committee will prepare
a revised schedule, which will be sub
mitted at next Thursday's meeting.
Nine clubs will take part in the series
of matches for the championship of the
C. A. .F. L.â Albion Rovers. Eagles,
Vampires, Independents, Oakland Hor
nets, San Franciscos, Thistles, Santa
Cruz and Sacramento. The Oakland
Hornets have not yet secured grounds,
but may play at Idora Park. Oakland,
fn conjunction with the San Franciscos.
The Vampires and Eagles, will share tha
cricket ground at Webster street. Ala
meda. The matches set for. November
12 and 26 and December 3, to be played
In, San Francisco, will take place on
the Presidio athletic ground. Later
matches In thl3 city will be played on
some other ground to be obtained
hereafter. Each team will play two
matches against every other team, so
that the schedule will consist of thir
ty-six matches, requiring (at the rate
of three each week) twelve weeks for
completion. Allowing for some wet
Sundays on .which' the grounds will not
be In a fit condition for play, the sched
ule will hardly be completed until the
end of February. 1906. The members
of the team that wins the championship
of the C. A. F. League have In prevjr J,
seasons received medals, but the d/Jf
culty of raising a fund to provtde"S.K*
medals has been so great that It has
been decided to award a pennant to the
club whose team proves the winner. .
After the league schedule is disposed
of, the ties for the C. A. F. Union cup
will begin. This trophy has already
been won twice by the Independents of
San Francisco, 1 who also won the cham

NO CAPTAIN TO LEAD
BERKELEY FRESHIES
Every Man oh Equal Footing
When Team Meets Stan
ford To-Day."
BERKELEY. Oct. 13.â The University
of California freshman football eleven
will go into to-morrow's inter-coliegiate
game with Stanford UnU'ersity without a
captain. This is an innovation In the
ennals of football for which Coach Knibbs
!s responsible. Knibbs bas decided that
-Â«*. captain is not an essential to the' or
ffanlration of the team. His decision to
night settled a contest that has. been on
for weeks as to whom the honor of head- .
Ing the eleven should fall.
There had been considerable rivalry
among the ambitious freshmen for the
coveted leadership, but Knibbs' edict is
law ana will be obeyed. The position of
captain, according to Knibbs, is prac
tically a useless one, so far as the play
itself goes. The signals in play are given
Always toy tne quarterback and the re
sulting moves are dependent upon the
team.
Coach Knibbs' ruling on this point,
made on the eve of the game, created
some comment among the football en
thusiasts, but It In no way eampened the
Berkeleyans interest. It was considered
as a matter of mere team organization,
not bearing upon the intrinsic merits of
the forthcoming gridiron struggle.

GIANTS ONCE MORE TRIUMPHANT

Dan Patch Manages to Equal
Star Pointers Record for
Mile Unpaced.at Lexington
LEXINGTON, Ky.. Oct. 13.â Star Point
er" continues to hold the world's cham
pionship for an unpaced mile in har
ness. In a trial to lower it to-day, Dan
Patch equaled It for the second time.
In view of a stiff breeze which the pacer
had to face through the third^iuarter, the
popular belief was that he could not
beat 1:59Â»i and that he equaled it was
regarded as a great performance. Her
sey was behind Dan Patch and Scott
Hudson drove the runner which accom
panied him alongside. Star Pointer was
driven on the track and after an ovation
from the crowd, viewed Patch's trial
from the head of the stretch.
The quarter was made in :30 flat and the
half in :19. For the next quarter the
horse had to contend with the wind. It
did not affect his speed appreciably, as
the three-quarters was reached in 1:25%.
But it told on his strength. At the head
of the stretch a second runner was picked
up and Dan Patch came home between
them. He showed that he waa tired.
Hersey, who drove him a mile Thursday
behind a pacemaker and dirt shield in
1:55 1-5 without > touching him. to-day
whipped vigorously through . the , last
eighth. Uiging was of no avail. The
crowd was not disappointed and as he
was paraded with a floral wreath about
his neck there was a great demonstration.

CRACK JOCKEYS
WILL BE HERE
L. A. Bonsack, Owner of
High Clmncellor, Wires for
Stallsâ Stray Turf Items
It is approaching time now to begin
figuring on the quality of riding talent
that will be available at Oakland and
Ingleside the coming winter. Radtke it
is a certainty will 'be here, for he is now
at Oakland with Jack Keene's big stable.
Judging from his record made in the
South and Middle West the past summer,
this youngster must be a "phenom."
Still, Radtke. may be kept hustling by
Frank Graham, who is under contract
to the Denver turfman. Edward Gaylord.
Frank headed the list of winning riders
both at the Denver and. Portland meet
ings and he assuredly is a comer. Then
there will be "Big Bill" Knapp and his
handy stick, and rumor has It that Willie
Davis will put in the season out this
way again. Davis' temper at times may
have required a bit of filing, but this
was excusable, for his ability in the sad
dle never suffered with " comparison.
Tommy Burns usually follows his hat and
he may head West again 'tis said. New
Orleans certainly would have no charms
for the redoubtable Tommy, especially it
there should still hansj fire a few smold
ering cases of the "yailer" peril down
in that section. At any rate , the riders
mentioned will- do for a leader. ;
There are any number of capable older
jockeys that should be attracted by the
game here when the new rule regarding
the apprentice allowance is given con
sideration. Three seasons ago Gene Hil
debrand, at that period an apprentice,
was unquestionably the best pilot on the
local tracks. In addition to his; natural
talents he of course was in receipt of
the five-pound "bug" allowance, and hi 3
services \u25a0 were in tremendous demand,
while other very capable riders were for
tunate in securing three or four mounts
in as many days. Now, .unaer the. recent
amendment to the rule made by the Pa
cific Jockey Club, an apprentice rider will
Only receive the five .pounds, allowance
when piloting- a horse for the stable that
holds his contract. , This equalizes mat
ters somewhat, and should prove, quite a
boon for the plain every-cay rider who
wears'. ho" bells. . .. ','' \u25a0'.'.'"".'. '.\u25a0'.'
L.. _A. Bonsack will \ spend a. portion of
his time up this way at least. The owner
oi High" Chancellor- wired Secretary^ Treat
for eight stalls yesterday. l He. will have
a. try for the "Opening and Burns handi
caps with the' Chancellor horse. .-
The big gelding Presidio tried con
clusions I with a freight engine at Emery
ville yesterday. Now his name won't ap
pear on the overnight entry, card any
more. .Presidio was a morning glorx and
it is to be hoped his slumber will not be
broken. :., V

NEW YORK. Oct. 13.â Three to one Is
now the advantage which :the New York
Nationals hold over the Philadelphia Am
ericans in the struggle for the world's
championship. The New Yorks scored
their third victory to-day and if the lo
cal men succeed In getting the better of
the visitors in to-morrow's contest the
world's championship flag wlll_fly from
the big mast on the Polo grounds.
Philadelphia, heavily handicapped by tfte
loss of the services of the erratic pitcher,
Rube Waddell, has succumbed to the
masterful work of Matthewson twice; and
to-day McGinnity pitched gilt-edged ball
whiclx partially atoned % for his defeat
at the .hands of Bender last Tuesday
on the' same diamond.
Managers Mack and McGraw arrived on
the battlefield to-day with firm determin
ation and while the betting:. .: which at
times was lively, indicated that the local
men' were almost prohibitive favorites,
SEALS TAKE TO VICKERS
pm&HEB, IS: IN FINE FORM
The speed ?that Rube "Vickers - tried to
bewilder the - Seals with: yesterday went
t pr about Six { innings.* In the other \u25a0 two
the charges of Uncle " Hank -got wised
up enough to stick: around and .wait. for
a while and while 1 they waited and
watched they grabbed four runsâ two in
the first and two In the seventh. These !
four were enough to let Uncle kick in |
with a .lame leg. for the Slwashea were
swinging their heads off at the benders \
of Nick Williams' without doing any ;
good. \u25a0"-> ii." * N -
The home fans saw .Vickers pitch yes
terday for the first time. He may be ;
one great man in Cincinnati, but he â¢
will have to show us here. He Is there,
with' a bunch of speed, but he has a habit ;
of keeping the ball right in the grove ;
all the time. This practice may be all j
right with a man like Kube Waddell, or:
Christy Matthewson, but Vickers did not ;
; have enough â¢'smoke" to carry him the
whole route and the Seals got to him
often enough to break up the. game. \u25a0
The first inning was the time when a
climax was reached. Waldron swatted
<ne fora safety and went, to second on
liildebrand's .out. He advanced a bag j
on Lauterborn's wild peg of Nealon's
grounder and "in the m:xup Nealon stole.:
Both arrived when Householder planted j
a torrid one past short and out into
i deep center field. ;
-Both teams kept swinging away at the ,
ball without making any progress till the:
Seals managed to" land right In the
seventh spasm. Gochnauer beat out a
bunt and went down to second en
Strelb's fumble. Shea ia:a down a nice
sacrilice and Williams drew a pass. Â»he
blonde pitcher stole ; second and Goch
nauer arrived on Waldron's drive. Wil- ;
Hams pulled up at third and slid over
the plate* when - Hildebrand laid down a
bunt. . V
;. Williams pitched a nice game of ball all
the "way through: The Si washes never
had a chance to get to him and he seem
ed: to know he held the Indian sign over
them from thel outset. He only walked
one man and that did not figure in the
final /going. Vickers managed to wing
"the first five of seven batters who faced
him, but after "that time the Seals set
tled down a bit -and learned how to hit
the. big ; rube. V The score:,

not a few of the Philadelphia adherents
were willing to risk money on the vis
itors* chance of victory. These betsveera
snapped up quickly and before the game
had gone two Innings atl wagering was
at a stands tilL
Manager Mack decided that his Indian
pitcher should have a sufficient rest and
put Plank in, who with good backin*
would have done better.
In the fourth inning, however, Monte
Cross was so anxious to get a bounder
from Mertes' bat that he. fumbled the
ball and Juggled with It long enough to
let the batter reach I first I bas& safely.
This- was the only error recorded In the
game, but It was an "expensive, one aa it
formed the nucleus . of a runâ the run
which won. ' : '- V-* : - '*\
McGinnlty and Plank ; were equally ef

hit which -the "Iron Man" failed to do.

PROHIBITION BEER
PLACED UNDER BAN
important Ruling Made by
the Federal Internal Rev
enue Bureau.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13.â Replying to an
inquiry regarding the construction : to be
placed â¢: on a recent ruling of his office
on alcoholic compounds labeled and sold
as medicines, Commissioner Yerkes of
the Internal Revenue Bureau holds as
follows: 1 - .
The rulinz does not apply to toilet articles,
whatever the- quantity of. alcohol -contained
therein may be; nor doeÂ« It apply to the vari
ous .essences or extracts to which you refer
tviz.: of lemon, vanilla, cinnamon) If these
preparations \u25a0 are suclÂ» ''- as are : known to the
legitimate grocery, or drug trade as household
articles: tor culinary and other uses and not as
beverage* ; .;;
Where,- however, alcoholic compounds called
"eisences of lemon, vanilla., cinnamon," etc.,
or so-called tinctures of essence of ginger, con
tain,-, as you state . "a mere : trifle of medica
ment, .-. the main constituent i being > alcohol,"
and the*>e s preparations, which you further say
are usually nold -by country merchants, .es
pecially in mohibltion districts, are : found by
the local internal revenue officers or agents
to ,be generally \u25a0 sold or used as beverages,
every merchant thus selling them without hold
ing the i requisite special tax stamp as a 'liquor
dealer under the internal revenue laws will be
liable to criminal Drosecutlon In addition to
the assessment against him of a special tax
and s penalty, and the manufacturers of these
so-called essences an<f extract*, who are
shown by the facts elicited to have made these
alcoholic compounds - for sale in prohibition
districts, will.be held liable to the special tax
and penalty aa rectifiers of liquors.
The commissioner has also held that
where : malt Â»' extracts composed largely of
fermented liquor are labeled and sold as
medicines, it ; is ' for the manufacturers to
show that these extracts are so combined
with drugs as . to be . genuine medicines,
not coming within the recent ruling of
his office.

A. G. VANDEHBILT BARELY
ESCArKS WITH HIS LIFE
WEWYORK, Oct. 13. â Alfred O. Van
derbilt and W. G. Sartorl, the Italian
automobile driver, had a narrow escape
â¢ from serious injury while racing in
Vanderbilt's high-power automobile
over the Vanderbilt cup oourse on Long
Island to-day. They had taken" the car
out for a trial spin and were going
at a speed of ninety miles an hour
down the narrow road from Albertsons
station toward the double reverse curve,
that is the dread of every driver en
tered for to-morrow's race. To the
watching.crowd at the turn it seemed
that the ! machine was beyond control
and would shoot straight ahead into
the field. â¢ ,
Within thirty yards of the first sharp
curve in the "S" Vanderbilt slapped on
the brakes. There was a succession of
loud reports and the ; wheels skidded
across the gutter and. against the soft
earth at the side, where big tele
phone poles were directly in Its path.
By a fraction of an inch the machine
missed the first of them and its rear
wheels actually grazed the second.
Then the machine turned "over on Its
side . and threw its occupants out . into
the soft earth. Sartori was slightly
bruised,' but Vanderbilt was uninjured.
They righted the machine and finished
the course.

Xrw York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 13. â There were Intervals
to-flay vhen trading came to a standstill at
the Stock Exchange. The market was dull and
uclnterpsting throughout. :fne day's meager
business, however, was nearly all done at
prices above tho6e of yesterday. A large pro
portion of the total transactions was completed
during the . fird hour of the session. This
showed the continuance or the rally in pivg
r^ss yesterday afternoon, which was started by
the revised options of Mr. VandtrHp'a utter
ances at the Washington convention of bank
ers. The firm tone of the money market put a
etop to any larpe extension of the- ep<Â»culative
operations and prices were left to fluctuate
eluggishly for the rest of Ihe day In an almost
iule market. ThiF intense dullness of any rally
in prices is a rignincant indication of the con
dition of the market. Holders do not sell un
less forced to do so by withdrawal of credits,
but conditions are po close in the money market
that no -encouragement is given for entering
fcpon operations for an advance. Whatever
preparations are necessary EOT the payment on
Monday of final Eubscripi-.ons to the Japaaeso
loan would have their effect in to-fiay'6 str>ck
rrenrket. pinre loene made on the Stock Ex
change on Friday carry Â«%er until Monday.
The rate was pretty ftiTnly held around 0 pT
cut until the principal neods were satisfied.
tut fell to some extÂ«*nt later In the day. The
forecast of the weekly currency movement had
fÂ»or.'e influence on this rrsult. Payments for
tW-- gold and for i-eTitione have reduced the
JJTiis by the banks to the Sub-Treasury to
$7J4.000. compared with $1,467,000 las=t week,
fctcrling exchange was strong and an active
demand for remittance was reported . to cover
li.-avy maturities on previous loan operations.
l*:acountÂ£ also advanced in LÂ»ondon and sterling
â¢ xchar.gi^ was easy in Paris and Berlin, al
th ,ugh ilsc-oin.e at ihese centers r acted c ght
ly. The Stock Exchange pay day in London
made a tpecial demand for moiVT >n that mar
toft The purdlAe of a iarge indei>endent ccal
company in the interest of the consolidated an
thracite :-properliee was a special factor of
strength for .the coalers. ! But the whole mar
ket turned strong in the latter part of the day
oc thÂ« prospect of a good bank statement, and
closed at the high level.
Bonds were irregular. Total sales, par
value, f2.915.000.

Xew York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 13. â Our market opened
unchanged, which was poor considering the
tables. The bears made a raid, but found buy-
Ing excellent and the market soon turned, run
ning-- sharply" some eighteen points .from the
low figures. Local bears seem to ignore the
fro6t reports, the latter being received from
almost every State. < While there 1b no'direct
news that it has done harm, it certainly has
done some and it generally can be said that It
has been the earliest light frost in history.
It is announced that the Government will
give us another monthly- condition on Cotton
November 10, made up to October' 2s. Inas
much as there never has been a report issued
at this late date, we will have ro comparison
and the report will probably only help to con
fupe the trade.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Oct. 13. â Weakness in- the wheat
market developed toward the end ,of the | first
hour.'l At the start the tone : was quite firm,
December opening,' a: shade: to V&@iic -higher
at 80VaÂ©86^4c. A small advance .. at Liver
pool ', was credited with r being responsible for
open buying on the part or a leading bull.
Moderate demand from the big longs held . tlu
market rirm tor a time, notwithstanding- sev
eral bearish factors. As a result of this buy
ing December sold up to 80% c. On with
drawal' of the bull support the market broke
quite ! sharply. * December declining to ;tjs%c.
Pit traders and commission houses- were tree
sellers. An Influence that contributed ma
terially vto '\u25a0\u25a0 the weakness was liberal move
ment of wheat to market. Receipts to-day In
the Northwest were of iarge proportions. In
the Southwest arrivals were larger than fot
the corresponding day a â¢ year^ ago. In \u25a0 ad
dition cash markets at all the principal grain
centers of the States showed a slightly
easier tone and there was little in. the ex
port news to' encourage ' bulls. Weakness pre
vailed . during the remainder of the session.
Closing prices were at almost the lowest point
of the day. Final \ quotations on- December
were at 85%@85%c. a loss of %c. .
The corn market was weak from start to
finish. Values could not withstand the almost
universal conviction that ! a record-breaking
crop was now probably safe from all possible
Injury by. frost.- 'The' market closed weak.
December -closed .'at 44% c, a loss of %c . r ,
Oats were easier in sympathy with tne weak
ness of other grains.' December closed /at
26% c.- a loss of >/6@Uc. . /\u25a0 .
Provisions were strong on active demand
\u25a0from shorts and on fair buying for invest
ment account. At the close January pork

Deciduous and Citrus Fruit*.
The fruit market reflected the conditions
which prevailed all the week, trade being of
average proportions and supplies Of moat .de
scriptions - ample. There were heavy arrivals
of table Grapes and that department of the
market was distinctly weaker, particularly for
large boxes ! from the Martinez regions, whlcn
forme* a large portion of the receipts. Wine
Grapes moved oft. well- at the. old quotations.
Berries were \u25a0in moderate - receipt and firm,
with Raspberries, Blackberries and ILongworth
Strawberries readily commanding higher prices.
Fine â¢ Cranberries . were - hetd * at ' stiff prices.
while off lota of Eastern were being pressed
for. sale at lower rates. The Apple market
was reported easy, ' with ' too much stotck on
hand, and all handlers were trying to urge
business by offering round conceseions to large
buyers.- All of the other small tree fruits were
In light supply and firm. *\u25a0 Receipt* of Melons
continued to decrease and there was an actual
scarcity of fine Nutmegs, which were quoted
higher. <A curious feature of the Citrus market
was \u25a0 the arrival of two carloads of Oranges
from the island of Jamaica. They were â¢of
the - Java , seedling variety and of good- size,
but lacking in color, and met- with r&ther.slow
sale at $2@3 per box. Domestic Oranges and

ACUMEN IN DENTISTRY.

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
By the terms of a- written covenant
signed by Dr. F. F. Lord; dentist," and
Elias Pitsblis..a Grecian manufacturer
and retailer of candies at 305 Fourth
street, the latter person's defective
teeth were to be ;made 'as perfect-as
science and skill could make them, and
as compensation for, his , work the*
practitioner 'was to received total sum
of $17 50, of which; $10 was to be paid
in advance and' a : brassy -watch and
chain deposited "as security for 'pay
ment of. .the remainder when the job
was finished. The retainer was planked
down and the operation
with. ' v- â¢ '-'\u25a0-
After an inspection of Signor Pit
soils' molars, incisors and cuspids Dr.
Lord decided that by gold-capping one
side tooth and supplanting its' decaying
inner neighbor with a natural-looking
substitute his part of the contract
would be. faithfully fulfilled and, with
customary . neatness, dispatch and
avoidance , of infliction' of- unnecessary
pain he accomplished that task and
demanded the $7 50 due. him. Signor
Pit sol Is demurred,"^ on the ground that
he had not spent $17 60 worth of time
in the operating chair. Vainly did Dr.
Lord argue that It was'not only the
time, consumed in the performance of
dental work,, but also the art employed
and the material used, that constituted
its cost.
"Your teeth," he said, "are now as
good as they can be made by me or
any other^ operator, and it is your
duty to pay "what you agreed to pay
when I undertook the contract."
But no . such reasoning would-satis
fy Signor Pltsolls. "You putta in da
wonna more 'falsa tooth an' you getta
da mon," he suggested. The doctor
firmly declined the proposal, pointing
out that in order to insert . another
bogus tooth he would be compelled, to
make room for it by extracting : a
sound one, a proceeding which .would
be both unprofessional and unjust to
the patient. "Dan, you no getta da
dam cen\" quoth Signor Pitsolls.' "Then
I must - keep your watch and chain,"
was the doctor's ultimatum. "Dan you
be arrest," said the .signor. And he
kept his' word.
When the dentist, accused of petty
larceny, appeared before Police Judge
Mogan he was much exercised lest his
professional- reputation might be in
jured by the charge.nor did bis.trepi
dation entirely vanish until the court
ordered his honorable acquittal/ Many
of his fellow-practitioners .'were pres
ent to testify that' they would have
done the very same thing that he did
If Signor Pltsolls had fallen into their
hands, but their good offices were not
considered, necessary, to* satisfy -the
Judgeâ who displayed a surprising
knowledge of the technique of dental
surgeryâ that the complainant had
been honestly served. . , . >
"I don't want to see the contract,"
said his rHonor, when the defendant
offered to show that document, "but I
would like to examine' this complain
ant's teeth." , . .
Signor Pl tsolis; instantly responded
by opening his mouth ;to fullest extent,
and when the Judge -Informed h'Fnr that
a mere baring^of -the^gums was suffi
cient he complied with the- suggestion.
Then, } after closely scrutinizing the
dental * array his .Honor said that -the
defendant was rightâ that it would bÂ«
necessary to remove a Bound tooth, to
make room for a; false one. â¢
"And it \is my ; opinion," said ; he to
Signor â¢ Pltsolls, .'.'that the work done
for - you ; by, Dr. Lord' is? worth more
than $17; 50. V However, , the law com
peljs him;- to ; return to -you 'that' watch
and chain and "collect' by: some other
means -the $7^6o' which you unques-"*

arrested Keiley, who was identified by
Ortega; during a brief interval of con
sciousness. . . : .
Away: back' in 1886 [the same "Fat
Jack" was sentenced to forty years at
Folsom' for having fatally assaulted a
; woman, and in . 1897 he was paroled as
a ; reward for \u0084his instrumental ity fin
preventing a dash for freedom by some
of his fellow convicts. Since his libera
tion* he 'has been employed as a- cow
puncher at Butchertownr The cause of
his quarrel with Ortega, who is a half
breeC Mexican, has not yet been dls
cloaed.
Patrolman J. W. Wright informed
Judge Cabaniss that fifty lady residents
of Cow Hollow~ which is contiguous to
the: northeastern boundary of. the Pre
sidio military reservation, would
cheerfully suspend , their domestic
.vocations .and avocations ; to â re
sppnd' to the ; from
him (the Judge) that they,- appear ai^d
testify to' the character of MiÂ« 3 Anfelia
Lewis/alias Scroggs (colored), who was
there charged with having committed
thei dual offense of battery and. peace
disturbance.,- \u25a0 , ,-
"Would* the testimony of the half
hundred, ladies." his Honor inquired,
"help or hurt Miss Lewis-rOr Scroggs â
in this case?"
"It would hurt her," was the reply,
"for every woman in the neighborhood
says she is a holy terror."
"Let us hear what you have to say con
cerning this alleged human blight of
Cow Hollowâ usually pronounced Holler
âand then we'll decide "whether addi
tional prosecuting evidence ,is needed,"
said the court.
Only last Monday, the policeman stated,
Miss Lewis was dismissed with a severe
reprimand by Judge Fritz, before whom
it had been proved that she attacked an
other policeman with a "hatpin. "No soon
er was she' released, however, that Cow
Hollow again became terror-stricken by
her conduct. Each and every one of
the fifty ladies before alluded to were
lashed, by her vitriolic tongue and even
her own parents and brother felt its
pungent sting. When he (the witness)
attempted to remonstrate ''and point' out
the error of her way. she punched his left
Jaw with her; right:' fist,, tightly clenched,
and all the way to prison she fought him
as a wildcat fightsâ with tooth and nail.
Miss Lewis preferred, to reserve her de
fense until' to-day \u25a0 and the Judge accom
modated her, at ": the ' same time hinting
to Patrolman ' Wright , that the presence
In court of the ' suggested feminine half
hundred would hardiy.be essential to an
intelligent prosecution of; the case.
In a broad Clydesid e dialect P^obert
Gibson of 2041 Hyde street told of how he
had been deprived of $800 through the
connivance of H. Khiron, an advertl^
ing clairvoyant, John Doe ] Lee and Bruce
Kimmis, the .two last named having
eluded capture.
With $500 that he desired to invest
profitably,- Mr. Gibson stated, he went to
Khiron for advice and Khiron immediate

there saw shares of the Signet Oil Com

of their fortunate holders. -Thus inform
ed,' Mr. Gibson hastened to the office' of
the Signet Company and arrived there
not a moment too soon, he was told by
Mr. Kimmla,' aa the- only 500 shares of
stock remaining unsold was almost as
good as purchased by a lady. 9 Mr. Gib-,
son's cash won the treasure, 'f, however,
and he was assured ; from ' that ' moment
the stock would yield him a; ten f per
cent! monthly 'dividend/
When he went to collect . his first . divi
dend Mr. Gibson was , received by -a;Mr.
Snyder, also connected : with V the .; Signet
Company, .who induced him to .add \u25a0 300
more , shares '; to his â¢ holdings. Then came
trouble. In the corporation and the dis

Statements oii the Stand
Blitz \W. Paxton, Santa Rosa banker
and capitalist, winced under the , verbal
lash, wielded by Bessie \V. j Paxton, who
was once; his wife, in : Judge Graham's
department of the Superior Court yes
terday. He was In court to fight against
the petitions of his blind son and invalid
daughter for maintenance. "Well-groomed
and showing in his ' dress every evidence
of the 'possession -of the \u25a0 wealth the
mother of his children vsays he enjoys
to their exclusion, ,he : . glanced at the
sightless eyes of his son* and at the frail
form 7>t. his daughter without the faintest
display . of emotion. .
'With the eyes of the spectators 'upon
him' arid the accusation, of > his former
wife ringing in his ears he was less at
ease, however.
Paxton first presented ah answer to his
children's petition . In g wnich he denies
that he* is possessed of the 'hundreds of
thousands of dollars - witn which they
credit him and says that he is worth no
more than $30,000. He also presented . an
affidavit signed by his physicians in which
it is stated that rheumatic gout and heart
disease compelled ~. him 'to relinquish his
position with the Santa Rosa Bank,' which
left him without salary or income other
than ' that : derived from- his small estate,
which, he- says, he. needs for the support
of his present wife arid child. . â¢,
I'AXTOX MAKES ADMISSION.
Upon staking the stand the capitalist
admitted, In answer to questions put by
Judge Graham, that he belle.ved he should
f.upport"his children, "but,^ he said, "I
will contribute nothing to them that
might be used by their mother for her
support." >-" -\u25a0 , r \u25a0- . \
Sprlrfglng to her feet, bitterness mark
ing every gesture, Mrs. Paxton walked
toward the - man whose abandonment of
her has cost her. years of Buffering, and
seid: ; , . ' , :
"And who, if it please you, took care
of your children when you took $40,000
from the bank and went to Europe "for
a good time? V You say, yoa should sup

tunity before any suit was filed, but you
turned ,your blind son away from your,
home when he went' to ask for aid."
Paxton winced and reddened, but tried

to smile unconcernedly.
VOh, you' may well laugh," I said Mrs.
Paxton, "when you are living In' luxury
and we are starving."
Paxton was silent under , the stinging
accusation. -
In an affidavit Mrs. Paxton said that
since the expiration In August of an
agreement entered Into between herself
and Paxton at the time. she divorced him
In 1894. under which he paid $100 a month
for the support of his children, Paxton
has only sent them $40, and that was. to
his blind â¢ son John. To his daughter
Roma he sent nothing.
. >O FOOD IX HOME.
"Why, even now," said Attorney. Han
lon, interpolating, "there is. no food in
the home of these people that are In sore
need."
" Again Paxton smiled; he found grim
humor In the lawyer's statement.
Continuing In her affidavit Mrs. Paxton
recited the facts of the abandonment of
herself and her children by her hus
band, who had become angered, she said
under oath, at her through her refusal
to submit to criminal mean* to stay the
advent of her baby girl Into the world.
She said he . sent . medicines and - got a
doctor. In his effort to compel her to sub
mit to his demand, but she refused, and
although ; her daughter had been sorely
tried through Illness her gentleness of
spirit has brought much comfort Into a
stricken home.
" At the conclusion of the reading of Mrs.
Paxton's affidavit. In concluding which
Â«he reiterates her , statement that - her
former husband is a wealthy man and
that his r statement to the * contrary is
made. solely to defeat the effort of her
children to secure a Judgment for main
tenance, the case was continued until
next Friday to enable Paxton to -file
counter statements, signed under oath.

POLICEMAN HELMS MUST

Judge Graham Holds That It la Bent
That She Be Given . Separate
Allowance.
' Judge Graham made an order yes
terday directing Policeman Henry
Helms to pay his wife Mary, who sued
him for maintenance. $40 a month.
Mrs. Helms was on the stand, and In
an effort to reconclliate the couple.
Judge Graham, said:
"Now. madam, will you not give
your husband another chance? Go back
and live with him andvl think that in
the end all will be right."
~ "No, I will not." answered. Mrs-
Helms..- "I would rather live for the
rest of my days in a woodshed with
nothing but ; ginger bread to 'eat than
to live with him. He has told me that
he" does not need ' me; that he Is a po
liceman "and can get all of the women
he wants." Mrs. Helms asserted that
her, husband .treated [her cruelly and
onoe ejected her from their home when
she was far.' from â¢ being fully robed.
Helms, who was present, denied all
of his .wife's 'charges \u25a0 and pointed to
her fine clothes as evidence of his gen
erosity.. '.'"Why," "he said, .."whenever
she. wanted a new dress she had it and
the. last time she .wanted one she re
fused to wait until pay day, and I was
compelled ; to borrow money to get It
for her, and thus insure the peace of
the "> household.? '*"".
Seeing how matters stood Judge Gra
ham concluded, that it was just as well
that the' policeman and his wife dwell
apart, so -he ordered Helms, to. pay her
$40 a - month for her "separate main
tenance.
