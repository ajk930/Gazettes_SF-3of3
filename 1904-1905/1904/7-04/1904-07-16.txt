SAN DIEGO, July 15.â From the noti
fication received from the Secretary of
State for the call of the primaries it
would seem that the Eighth Republi
can Congressional District committee
did not file its petition in time to havo
the Congressional convention held at
Santa Ana on the 16th. The district
committee recently decided to call a
separate convention and made a pew
apportionment on the basis of the vote
fcr Captain Daniels instead of on the
vote for Pardee. This apportionment
would cut San Diego's representation
from 16 to 14 and would increase that
of Tulare County from 8 to 9 votes.
This would make a difference of 3
votes to M. L.- Ward and be in favor
of S. C. Smith. The failure of the com
mittee to get its petition to Sacramento
in time compelled the Secretary of
State to act on the call of the State
committee and call for the election of
8 delegates inside the city at the pri
maries on the 8th of next month.

discussed at all.

other thing. He felt certain that Judsre

he meant by. the last remark.

NEW YpRK, July 15.â Dun's review
of trade to-inorrcr\v will say:
Trade conditions were gradually be
coming more normal after the conclu
sion of the political conventions, when
a new disturbing factor appeared in
the shape of the strike of packing
house employes and allied trades. This
enhanced prices of meats and added
many thousands to the already large
army of unemployed, weakening the
purchasing power of the . people still
further. Aside from this unfavorable
development the news of the week
caused much encouragement. Crop
prospects improved and the general
level of prices of farm products prom
ises a large return to agriculturists,
which means better business for all in
dustries.

BERLIN, July 15. â A dispatch to the
Lokal Anzeiger from Newchwang,
dated July 11, describes the friction
between General Kuropatkin and
Viceroy Alexieft* which, in connection
with the correspondent's recent j inter
view with General Kuropatkin, indi
cates that the present dispatch was
based on information from near the
Russian headquarters.
The correspondent says that Viceroy
Alexieft continually disturbs military
mattcre by assuming kingly airs. He
reverses Kuropatkin's orders, arro
gating powers as the Emperor's direct
representative. When troops arrive at
Mukden Alexieff holds inspections and
parades, delaying the soldiers' arrival
at the front. He sends his own chief of
staff twice or three times weekly to Ta
tchekiao to observe and report on Gen
eral Kuropatkin's doings. It was re
ported that the officers' corps was al
most ready to mutiny against the
Viceroy, but refrained.

SAN ANTONIO. Tex., July 16. 2 a. m.
- South-bound passenger train No. 5
on the International and Great North
ern Railway was held up at 11 o clock
Friday night about four and a half
miles south of Oakwoods. The first in
timation the railway officers had of ths
hold-up was the appearance of two
passengers at Oakwood3. They could
say nothing beyond the fact that the
train had been held up. They did not
know how many robbers there were
and did not remain on the scene long
enough to learn whether an attempt
was made to blow up the mail or ex
press car. The train left St. Louis
Thursday night at S:30 o'clock and ia
due in San Antonio this morning.
It carried both registered and ordi
nary mail, in addition to express. Con
ductor Blount of San Antonio is in
charge of the train and Engineer Me-
Quillen of Palestine at the throttle.
At 3 o'clock this morning the train
had not reported at any station, which
led the officers to believe something
serious had occurred after the hold
up. It is thought the affair occurred
at Spar Switch, which is a blind sid
ing. Steps have been taken to advise
Sheriffs and other officers and to start
a posse immediately after the robbers.

CAMDEN. N. J.. July 15.â In response
to a telephone message from the Sher
iff of Burlington County, Governor Mur
phy' to-day sent a detail of the Na
tional Guard now in camp at Sea Girt
to this city to escort Timbers and Sims,
the negro assailants of Mrs. Elsie Bid
die, to the Jail at Mount Holly. The
Sheriff informed the Governor that the
feeling in Burlington and Mount Holly
was bitter against the negroes, and he
considered the presence of the troops
necessary as a precautionary measure.
The troops escorted the negroes to the
County Jail and then went Into camp
to await the result of the trial. After
the trial they escorted the men to the
State Prison at Trenton.
â¢'The rapidity with which the cases
of the three assailants of Mrs. Biddle
were tried, sentenced and sent to
prison was due to a meeting of 200 men,
at which arrangements were made to
blow open the jail to-night, secure the
prisoners and lynch them. It was the
women of the county that drove the
men to determine upon a desperate
measure."

LIAOYANG. July 15.â Fighting is im

The Japanese are entrenched six
miles south of Tatchekiao. Much
skirmishing is taking place.
It Is rumored that a Japanese column
has appeared on the Mukden road.
There are several Japanese wounded
at Liaoyang. They are well treated
and contented.
There has been a sudden movement
of the Japanese right flank to the
south.
There is further confirmation of the
reports that Koreans are guarding the
Japanese rear. There are 10,000 Koreans
regularly enrolled in the Japanese ser
vice and these, with a leaven of Jap
anese and under Japanese officers, are
guarding the lines of communication.
MUKDEN, July 15.â In the fighting
at the right flank of the line of de
fenses of Port Arthur on July 3 to
July 6, the Russians drove back the
Japanese and occupied the east bank
cf the Lunsantan and the heights com
manding Lunsantan Pass. The Jap
anese losses were about 2000. Those of
the. Russians were insignificant.
All is quiet in the direction of the
Russian left flank. The populace Is
following peaceful occupations and
working in the fields.
It seems certain that the Japanese
right flank is weak.
According to the Chinese, the Jap
anese are making great preparatibns

Boris departed in a very crestfallen
state, while Kuropatkin the following
day bundled off the harem and other
hangers-on on an ordinary troop train
â very different from the luxurious
cars they had traveled out in.
Boris, among other escapades, had
issued a proclamation offering a re
ward for the capture of handsome Jap
anese geisha girls, who were reported
to be following the Japanese general
staff.
On one occasion, at Mukden, [a
divinely beautiful Circassian was Wor
shiped as Venus by Boris, his other
women and officer friends and an im
pudent message was sent by him to
Kuropatkin, inviting the general to
forsake the god of war for the goddess
of love.
Boris proceeded to ilemoralize en
tire garrisons. "He had parties which
became indescribable orgies, treated
everybody with insolent disdain ' and
drew his sAvord on Kuropatkin when
the general sent for him and ordered
him to dismiss his suite, mend his
Conduct and to conform to ordinary
discipline. '
Kuropatkin was only restrained by
his aid-de-camp from replying to this
insult by cutting Boris clewn, but con
tented himself with telegraphing to the
Czar, 'peremptorily requesting that
Boris be at once recalled.' The Czar
thereupon telegraphed Boris tq leave
Mukden on the next train, accompa
nied by one servant and to report him
self as under arrest to the Governor of
Moscow.
BERLIN, July 15.â Further particu
lars of the circumstances under which

FT. PETERSBURG, July 1G.â The
lack of further official news regarding

St. Louis convention, where it was
waved in honor of the Judge's nomi
nation. In the evening, usually. Secre

great evils should be eradicated, when

Judge's footsteps and photographed
not only himself, but every one and
everything remotely connected, with
him or his daily life. To-day a series
of pictures was taken of the Judge and
his family, picturesquely grouped on
the lawn near the house.
Judge Parker to-day received the

On the other hand, smoke has been
coming out of the inner crater of
Kileauea during the last few days. The
volcano had shown little activity re
cently, but there appears to be re
newed quantities of smoke coming
forth every morning. \
HONOLULU, July 3.â Trees, lantana
and other shrubs are sprouting inside
the crater of Kilauea. This is unusual.
It is taken as an indication that the
subterranean activity is decreasing and
that the sulphur and other poisonous
gases are not being emitted in such
quantity as previously. There are
various steam cracks about the im
mense floor of the crater and steam ia
always coming out of these, the heat
In some of them being intense. Many
of these cracks are reported now to be
dead, and this would account for the
growth of trees and shrubbery in the
crater.

The application for a lease of Dia
mond Head has not been acted on yet,
but awaits its turn with other import
ant matters in the land office.
HONOLULU. July 9.â Not long ago a
Portuguese started a small farm on top
of the extinct crater of Punchbowl,
â¢growing melons and vegetables for the
local market. His enterprise may be
followed on a much larger scale by J.
L. Coerper, who has applied to the Ter
ritorial Government for a lease of the
well-known Diamond Head crater. .
Coerper came here from Germany and
is a good judge of soils. He has made
up his mind that the choicest products
of orchard, vineyard and truck patch
can be raised in abundance in the Dia
mond Head crater. Coerper is espec
ially smitten with the idea of cultivat
ing a vineyard of such grapes as grow
at the home of his boyhood. And wa
termelons would grow with Impunity,
for the crater is bug-proof and beetle
free. No worm has ever been known
to Â£reep up its calcined walls and no
moth or winged insect ever rises above
the rim of the crater except to be
hurled far out to sea by the winds
which blow from Kaimuki. A vegeta
ble garden in Diamond Head crater
would, therefore, be insured for all
time against pests and no entomolo
gist would be required on the payroll.
Coerper, who has a practical eye, has
surveyed the Diamond Head steeps, and
figures that a pack trail to the summit
, would cost less than $1000. Up this pack
trail would go the seeds and cuttings
to/ start the isolated farm. Down the
trail would come long lines of burros
laden with the fruitage of foresight and
: toil, to the Honolulu market.

ufacture better shingles than are made

The police are investigating the
case of the passing of a fictitious check
on July 8 upon Miersch & Claus of
the Emporium bakery at Ellis and
Leavenworth streets. The peculiar
feature of the case is the fact that the
man who passed the check was in
troduced to the firm by A. Silverstein,
who had $925 taken from his purse
at the St. Paul House, 465 Ellis street,
last Wednesday.
On July 8 Silverstein called at the
bakery with a man whom he intro
duced as H. Heller, a friend. After
talking for a few minutes Heller pro
duced a'check for $27 50 on the Kern
Valley Bank at Riverside, purporting
to be signed by "Ross & Fenton" and
payable to "A. Silberberg." It bore
the Silberberg indorsement. He
asked the firm to cash 'the check and
the money was handed to him. The
check was sent to the bank for collec
tion and was marked "no good."
Detectives Dlnan and "Wren saw Sil
verstein yesterday and he said he had
known Heller for years and that Heller
had been in the installment business
in this city like himself. He had
promised Heller to meet him In Los
Angeles, but when " the - detectives
pointed out 'that Los^ Angeles was not
Included* in his route, eastward he said
that he was afraid that Heller might
take hfs nioney' from -him and he had
told him he would meet him in the
southern city.

COMMISSIONERS HEAR
CHARGES AGAINST SMITH
WASHINGTON. JUly 15. â The Na
tional Wholesale Liquor Dealers' Asso
ciation of America to-day filed a com
plaint with the Interstate Commerce
Commission against thirty-one rail
roads, alleging discrimination in freight
rates on whisky shipped from Missouri
Elver and Eastern points to the Pacific
Coast.
The rate on whisky is given as $1 23
a hundred pounds. The rate on alcohol,
pure spirits and high wines is 85 cents
a hundred. It costs $400 to ship a car
load cf whisky to the Pacific Coast,
but a carload of high-proof spirits,
from which the Pacific Coast whisky
manufacturer can make two carloads
of whisky, can be shipped for $255.
This condition is complained of as
disastrous to Eastern manufacturers,
and tho Interstate Commerce Commis
sion Is asked to have the rate on whisky
and spirits rnade the same, also to
ord^r the railroads to restore to skip
pers of whisky the amounts they have
paid in the past in excess of the rate
on spirits.
CITY REMARKABLY FIXER
FROM INFECTIOUS DISEASE
BUFFALO, N. Y., July 15.â Edgar T.
Washburne of the grain firm of Heath
fleld & Washburne, shot and killed his
wife and fifteen-year-old daughter to
day at their residence and then com
mitted suicide.
It is believed the deed was committed
while Mr. Washburne was suffering
from. a temporary flt of Insanity. He
had written a letter to a relative re
cently saying he was having trouble in
business.
The tragedy was discovered by a
relative who called at the Washburne
house shortly before noon. When the
police arrived they found Mrs. Wash
burne and her daughter lying dead,
side by side, in bed. Washburne was
dead on the floor at the foot of the
bed. Evidently Washburne shot the
girl first as she lay in bed. When Mrs.
Washburne. aroused by the shot,
partly raised herself in bed^ Washburne
flred the second shot, theTaullet enter
ing the woman's left temple and caus
ing instant death. Washburne then
picked up a mirror to take aim and
shot himself in the right temple.
The news of the tragedy had the ef
fect of paralyzing the grain exchange
for the remainder of the day. Wash
burne was an ardent spiritualist.
When he first entered the grain busi
ness. It is said he was fortunate and
he attributed his success to advice re
ceived through mediums.

DEADWOOD. S. D.. July 15.â The
Black Hills will be seriously affected
by the packing house strike. Although
the Black Hills is in the center of one
of the largest cattle shipping districts,
very little of the meat used comes from
the range-fed cattle. The packing com
panies have offices in Deadwood, from
which point meat is distributed to all
parts of the Hills country.
A raise in price has occurred and the
managers predict a still further ad
vance.
the strikers to be re-employed as rapid
ly as places can be found for them;
preference to be given the strikers in
the order of their applications for
work; all men now at work to be re
tained and the temporary wages to be
in accordance with the schedule in ef
fect at the time of the strike.
Allied trade unions at the stock
yards are becoming restless and unless
a settlement is reached in the near fu
ture they may decide to stop work in
sympathy with the men already out.
The members of the allied trades at
the Chicago, stockyards number 15,000
men and most of them belong to
unions. A mass meeting of these men
will be held to-morrow night when the
question of their quitting work will
be discussed.
EMPLOYING MANY MEN.
ThÂ£ work in the packing plants in
Chicago was continued to-day on a
much Ifirger scale Â«han at any time
since .he strike began. Many new men
have been empjoyed, among whom, it
is eaid are numbers of skilled work
men.
A non-union workman was assailed
to-day by a crowd as he emerged from
the stockyards. He was beaten,
kicked and stoned, . but managed to
reach a street car and escaped. The
crowd threw stones at the car and
injured a striker who was aboard.

NEW YORK, July 15.â Prices of beef

Cold storage poultry has been ad
vanced 2 cents a pound. Incubator
chickens and ducks are abundant, but
the price is almost prohibitive to the
poor. '
Union teamsters refused to handle

here within the last twenty-four hours.

While Efforts to Settle the Strike of Meat Handlers Are Tempo
rarily Deadlocked, the Employers Are Engaging Many Men
and Operating Their Plants on Larger Scale- Each Day
CHICAGO. July 15.â Negotiations for
peace in the butchers* strike are at a
standstill to-niglit and the strike will
continue until one side or the other
make.-- concessions. Both are anxious
for a peaceful settlement, but the stum
bling block to a final' adjustment
is that neither is now prepared to al
low tho other to dictate the basis of
arbitration.
This ;ifternoon the packers consid
ered Donnelly's reply to their proposal
cf las-t night and announced it unsat
isfactory. Union officials were advised
that it would be imixissible to reach an
apreement along the lines suggested by
Donnelly. In thtir answer to Donnelly,
the backera declared themselves ready
to arbitrate; but stipulated that the ar
bitration should include the entire
soope of the strike and not be limited
In ar.j- way. This communication was
Identical with the one sent yesterday
to Donnelly and to which the counter
proposition of to-day was a reply.
With the reply of the nackers. was
sent a note to Donnelly advising
him that they would be ready for his
answer to-morrow, and that if he de
gired another conference with them
they would be pleased to meet him
in another effort to reach a basis of
arbitration. No arrangements have as
yet I/ten made for another conference,
but the replv of the unions to the latest
note of the packers will be sent to
morrow morning, after which Donnelly
v.ill leave for St. Louis, where he will
address a mass meeting of strikers on
Sunday afternoon.
PROPOSAL AND REPLV.
Donnelly** latest proposal to the
packers follows: All grievances to be
submitted to arbitration; ail strikers
to be reinstated in a body; en em-

them: the temporary wage scale to be

This mean? that unskilled labor is to
be paid, pending the decision of the ar
bitrators. 1S'^ cents, instead of 15 to

SIOUX CITY, Iowa, July 15.â As the
non-union men were leaving the Cud
ahy packing plant on their way from
work to-day they were set upon by a
gang of union workmen, who jeered
them and threw bricks and stones.
Street car windows were smashed, but
no one was seriously injured.
Cots have been provided at the plant

of trouble to-morrow they will sleep at

PANAMA, July 15.â No settlement
has been reached of the questions
pending between the republic of Pana
ma and the officials of the canal zone.
The Panama Government is firm in the
belief that the only correct interpreta
tion of the canal treaty is that until
the canal shall be constructed all parts
of the isthmus are under the direct
Jurisdiction of Panama.
The fact that the relations between
the Panama Government and Major
General Davis, Governor of the canal
zone, are cordial, leads the people of
the republic to hope that the questions
will be satisfactorily settled.
Orie of the results of the situation
arising out of the decree issued by
Governor Davis establishing a custom
house in the canal zone and the order
compelling all steamers departing from
La Boca to secure clearance papers
from th.e United States authorities is
the union of all political parties toward
a common end. The last act of the
Assembly before adjourning to-day
was to unanimously approve a propo
sition that all the Congressmen should
go to President Amador and offer their
services in aiding the Government to
defend the rights of the nation. The
President was deeply moved by this
act, which proved that all political
parties are with the Government. In
addressing the Congressmen he said
he had absolute faith in the Govern
ment of the United States, whose gen
erous and noble conduct toward the
South American republics left no
doubt that the canal treaty would be
correctly Interpreted.
Decree of Governor Davis
Has Good Effect in Solidi
fying All the Factions
TROUBLE XOT -FEARED
The litigation turned largely on the
question of the title of the Northern
Pacific stock which E. H. Harriman
and Winslow S. Pierce put into the
combination and which amounted to
about $79,000,000. The contention of the
Northern Securities Company was that
the stock had become the absolute
property of that company and that it
was perfectly legal for the Northern
Securities Company to carry out the
pro rata plan of distribution, upon
which the company had agreed. Har
riman contended that by reason of the
corporation having been declared il
legal by the United States Supreme
Court title had not passed from Har
riman and Pierce, and, in consequence,
they were entitled to have returned to
them the particular Btock they had
put into the combination and which
involved control of the Northern Pa
cific Company. .
The decision of Judge Bradford does
not dispose of the main points at is
sue in the case, which are whether or
not Harriman and Pierce should have
returned to them the stock of the
Northern Pacific Company which they
put into the Northern Securities Com
pany or whether they should have dis
tributed to them the stock of both the
TRENTON, N. J., July 15. â Judge
Bradford to-day granted a preliminary
injunction in the suit brought by Ed
ward H. Harriman, Winslow S. Pierce
and others to restrain the proposed
pro rata distribution of the assets of
the Northern Securities Company. This
is a defeat of the Hill interests.
Northern Pacific and the Great North
ern companies on the pro rata basis
provided for by the directors of "the
Northern Securities Company.
Judge Bradford devoted most of his
opinion to the discussion of a legal
question as to whether, he should grant
a preliminary injunction, and he takes
the position that as long as there is
any doubt in the case and no injury
can come to the complainants a pre
liminary injunction would be granted.
He says, further, that the failure to
grant a preliminary injunction would
permit the distribution of the stock in
the Northern Pacific Company to which
Harrirnan and Pierce claim title and
put the complainants in a position
where they would be unable to secure
relief to which they would be entitled
should the case be decided in their fa
vor on final hearing.
Judge Bradford said that such an
injunction would not interfere with the
operation of either railroad, nor would
it be injurious to the public.

Judge noted a marked contrast be
tween the Russian and Japanese com

illiterate, and the latter wide awake,
clever and progressive. Everywhere in
Japan, he said, there seems to be a
general desire to advance, . mentally

he must go forward and he is on the

Superior Sunset Oil Comnany Is
Forced to Liquidate Debt of $1200
for Surgical Services.
The Superior Sunset Oil Company of
Los Angeles must pay Dr. W. P. Scott
$1200 for surgical operations perform
ed upon one of the corporation's em
ployes, according to a decision ren
dered by the Supreme Court yesterday.
The debt was contracted by the com
pany's secretary and tacitly acknowl
edged by two of the directors, but
when the bill was presented payment
was refused.
The defendant employed a man
named Carroll to protect its oil land
from claim jumpers. After the man
had been at work about a week ho
was sent to the hospital suffering
from gunshot wounds. Dr. Scott was
called upon to attend the patient by
the oil company's secretary and found
it necessary to perform several oper
ations.
The surzeon did what he called
11200'worth of work and when he
found there was no pay coming he
brought suit. The Superior Court de
cided in his favor and the Supreme
Court affirms that decision.

WATCHMAN DILLEY IS
NOT GUILTY OF CRIME
Commissioner North Decides It Was
nn Indiscretion to Accent a Gift
From Chinese Woman.
United States Immigrant Commis
sioner North has transferred Chinese
Watchman Alfred E. Dilley to the po
sition of general watchman. Mr.
North said yesterday that Dilley had
been investigated for having accepted
a small mirror from a Chinese woman
confined in the detention shed and
awaiting a landing. The evidence
showed that Dilley admired the mir
ror and the woman, with Oriental
courtesy, offered it to him. With Oc
cidental courtesy he accepted it, not
knowing that the offer of a gift from
an Oriental is usually tied -with a
strong cable tow and that it is Ori
ental etiquette to decline to accept.
Mr. North is of the opinion that Dil
ley was not guilty of a criminal act,
but that he had been very indiscreet
Hence the transfer.
SUPREME COURT THINKS
DOCTOR SHOULD BE PAID
asked Attorney Campbell.
"Of property owned by or money
owing the firm," was the reply.
"Had not this property already been
deeded away?"
"A great deal of it had, that is, the
deeds were held by banks to be re
turned when loans were repaid."
"Were not the most of these deeds
held by the London, Paris and Amer
ican Bank?"
"I believe they were."
The witness was then asked to ex
plain how he estimated the value of
the various properties, and in reply
said he had taken into consideration
the original cost and the income from
them as shown by the books. He had
an itemized list as calculated by him
and Attorney Campbell readily con
sented that he might refresh his mem
ory from it, at the same time produc
ing the ledger of the firm. This led
to a storm of protest from the attor
neys for the defense, who argued
against any such comparison. Judge
Lawlor permitted the figures from the
ledger to be read, but they were not
directly compared with Josua's list.
The sum total was vastly at variance,
; however, being about one-half. ' The
! witness seemed unable to account for
; the sudden boom in real estate, but
I said he had obtained some information
from other books and Mitchell had
i aided him.
f . Josua then detailed his conversation
with Colonel Beck on April 10 at some
length. He had visited Beck to set
tle up a matter regarding insurance
and Beck had mentioned the subject
of loaning money on wheat. The con
versation took place In the Interna
tional Bank, but whether in Beck's
private office or in front of the rail
he could not remember, nor did he
know if a third party was present. Of
one thing he was positive and that
was when he mentioned Beck's proffer
in the office of Eppinger & Co. Jacob
was not present. As to any other con
versations with Jacob Eppinger, Her
man Eppinger" or Bernard Ettlinger
the witness' mind was a blank.
JACOB'S ACTIVITY.
"What did Jacob Eppinger do dur
ing the months of March and April,
1903?" was asked.
"He attended to the general business
of the firm."
"Were any loans negotiated in
March and April?"
"Yes."
"By whom."
"I don't know."
"Did not Jacob Eppinger do the
major portion of the banking busi
ness?"
"I presume he did."
"Do you know of a single loan nego
tiated by Bernard Ettlinger in 1903?"
"No."
' Regarding the warehouse receipts
for lots of grain that did not exist,
Josua said he had given Topping
some grader balances and on the
strength of these the receipts were is
sued. Grader balances he described
as "variations." He was not positive,
but thought he got his information
from Ettlinger regarding them.
Objection was made by Attorney
Dunne to the line of questioning and
Attorney Campbell replied: "We are
conducting this examination and if we
show that this witness authorized an
other person to commit a felony he is
totally unworthy of belief and his tes
timony is worthless."
At this morning's Bession the jury
will have an opportunity to examine
the many exhibits In the case. % __

Dies of Cholera Morbus.
Never before in the history of the Philip
pines have the conditions been so satisfactory
as at the present time, thanks to thp admin
istration of Governor Wright. I'ndpr his di
rection the Philippine question is being rap-
Idly settled By this I do not want It under
stood that I am making comparisons with the
administration of former Governor Taft. Under
the Taft administration things , were in the
initial stage toward Americanization. During
that time the newspapers were more or less
nagging at the administration in the Philip
pines and many editors were sent to prison.
That is changed now, for the papers are more
fairly in accord with the Government. Their
attitude has changed and Governor Wright
certainly has no cause for complaint from
One thing the people of the islands are not
prepared for and that is their Independence.
They are not yet ready to govern themselves
and no one appreciates the fact more than the
educated men of the .Philippines. The time
of course will come, but how soon in the
future Is yet to be determined by their educa
tional progress.
When seen last evening Dominguez
admitted that he intended to pay a
visit to Washington and New York
and when pressed for an answer as to
whether he would take an active part
in the coming campaign he replied that
if the independence of the Philippines
became a question of the campaign he
might Inject himself into the strife in
the interest of the Republican party.
Dominguez went to the Philippines as
Spanish interpreter to the first com
mission and later engaged in the prac
tice of law. He became the attorney
for Aguinaldo, who, he says, has been
much maligned. The deposed leader
cf the Filipinos, Dominguez insists, is
most loyal to the United States and
has been ever since he took his oath
of allegiance. Aguinaldo seeks no poli
tical position, aeks nothing from the
United States and has striven hard
to maintain peace among the natives.
To Aguinaldo's pacific stand Domin
guez attributes much of the present
contented condition of the Filipinos.
Discussing the situation in the islands,
Dominguez said:
F. E. Dominguez, formerly a resi
dent of this State and now a promi
nent attorney of the Philippines, ar
rived yesterday from Manila and is
registered at the Palace. While he
announced yesterday that the principal
purpose of his return to California is
to see his aged mother, who resides
in Los Angeles, the report accompan
ied him from the Orient that he has
another motive in coming to the UnlteS
States at this particular timeâ and that
is to stump the West for President
Roosevelt.
Percy McMillan, who was stabbed in
the right arm by David Lawrence on
July 12, wants payment for the injury
and yesterday brought suit for $2275
damages. He declares that the wound
in the arm is dangerous and will pre
vent him from working for six weeks,
and that he will have to pay a physi
cian SiO for attendance. McMillan is- a
waiter at a restaurant on Larkin street,
and at 2 a. m. on the date mentioned
Lawrence made a disturbance in the
place which ended in the cutting.
Lawrence is sole agent here for one
of the big tobacco companies.

Suesser did not sleep much last night,
preferring to converse with the death
watch
Father Egan of San Rafael attended
the condemned man in his last hours.
Suesser was 27 years of age and had
been confined in San Quentin for nearly
five years.
SAN QUEXTIN PRISON, July 15.â
George Suesser, who murdered Sheriff
Farley at Salinas in 1899, was executed
here this morning at 10:30 o'clock.
Suesser bravely mounted the scaffold
and shov.ed no sign of nervousness.
Just aÂ« the hangman was about to
slip the rope over his head Suesser
exclaimed: "Wait a minute, wait a
minute, until I kick on* these slippers."
He then straightened up to receive the
rope and remarked: "I don't want to
die with those things on."
The trap was sprung at 10:30, and
eleven minutes later Dr. Casey, the
resident physician, pronounced Suesser
dead.
3pecial Dispatch to The Call
At this point Attorney Campbsll
pc-ured oil on the troubled waters and
the trial proceeded.
Josua Eppinger was recalled to the
etand for cross-examination and tes
tilied that he had been employed by
th^ firm of Eppinger & Co. for about
twelve years, first as bookkeeper ;ind
afterward taking: charge of the foreign
correspondence, at the same time at
tending to a private brokerage business
cf his own. Ke had never negotiated
any loans, but had sold bills of t.x
ehanpe and frequently examined the
money book "merely out of curiosity
to see what was earning in and going
cut."' He did not know the financial
â¢tanding of the tirm on April 14, 1903,
until a few days ago when, in company
vith Mr. Mitchell, he went over the
books and made out a list of assets,
which he footed up as 51.250.000.
ASSETS OF THE FIRM.
"Of what did these assets consist?"
Josua testified that he had never
taken any active part in the negotiat
ing of loans, or. as it was termed, the
"banking business," of the firm, but
that the major portion of this work
Â¦was attended to by Jacob Eppinger.
He- did not know who negotiated the
loan from Colonel Beck, but remem
bered that, a few days prior to the
consummation of the deal. Beck had
expressed a d^Fire to loan money on
California wheat. Josua reported this
on his return from Beck's bank, but
â¢was positive his uncle was not in the
office of Eppinger & Co. at the time
and did not remember whether or not
be "as in the office that day.

Judge Currey, Tax Collect or Smith. Wil

was good.
The examination of Eyre provoked
another wordy war between the Dis

Dunne in reply said the question was
couched in good English and as an

"Do you understand the tone of Mr.

"Do >ou understand Mr. Byington's

In the trial of his uncle, Jacob, for the
greater portion of the day yesterday
and from his unwilling lips Attorney
Campbell wrung admissions as to the
business methods of the firm of Ep
pinger & Co. not calculated to elevate
the standing of the bankrupt firm In
the minds of the Jurors. It was a'.so
ehown that Josua had a very peculiar
but convenient method of estimating
the assets of the firm at the time of its
failure. This method consisted of
â¢imply adding to the value of each
piece of property as shown by the
ledger an amount sufficient to bring up
the sum total to the desired aggregate.
That this property had already be^n
deeded away provisionally to various
banks to secure loans apparently w*s
Immaterial. Josua also admitted that
Watson W. Topping, bookkeeper of the
firm, had issued warehouse receipts for
*"F" lots of wheat from memoranda
furnished by him when he did not know
that such lcrts existed. The actual re
sponsibility for this was. as usual,
thrown upon the missing Bernard
Ettlinger.
The Board of Public Works must
prescribe in the permit granted the
time for such occupancy of a street.
Upon the failure or neglect of the per
mittee to remove or cause to be re
moved to the satisfaction of said
Board of Public Works such dirt, debris
or "materials within three days after
being notified so to do by the board,
the money deposited as a guaranty or
so much thereof as may be necessary,
shall be used by the board in the re
moval of such dirt, debris or materials.
The prime object in enforcing the last
ordinance is the fact that the sweeping
of streets is now being done by the
city, and the work is greatly hampered
by the dust and dirt which blows from
building materials and from the ex
cavation of streets. The" Board of
Works desires to sweep the streets well
and will insist on strict compliance
with the regulations by building con
tractors.
REMOVAL OF DEBRIS.
The ordinance provides that a per
mit must, "first he obtained for the
placing of materials used in the con
struction or repair of a building. Such
material? or appliances shall not oc
cupy more than one-third of the width
of the roadway of the street and not
more than one-half of the width of
the sidewalk, and shall be placed there
on under the direction and to the satis
faction of the Board of Public Works,
but in no case shall they be placed
within three feet of a railroad track.
'Violation of the ordinance is punish
abie by a fine of $500 and six months'
imprisonment.
The second ordinance to be enforced
provides regulations for the temporary
occupancy of a public street by ma
terials or appliances for any pifrpose
and authorizes the Board of Works
to make rules and regulations relative
thereto.
FIXES PENALTY.
It shall tv unlawful for any person, firm or
corporation to erect, or cause to be erected, or
to continue the erection of any building with
in the tire limits, or to cover the same with
mastic or other coating of mortar, without
first laying, or causing to twÂ» laid, on tha
outer half of the width of tha sidewalk and
next to the curb a temporary or permanent
sidewalk, for the use of pedestrians, and with
out first erecting. i>r causing to bq erected, a
good and substantial fence, at least twelve feet
high. Inclosing the inner half of the width of
the sklewulk. so as to protect pedestrians from
brick, timber, mortar or debris falling from
auch building. Such sidewalk must be so con
strvrted. and all building operations must be
so conducted, that pedt-strians shall have a
free and unobstructed passage over at least
the r.uter one-balf of the official width of thÂ«
sidewalk next the curb.
The first ordinance to be strictly en
forced by the board requires tempor
ary sidewalks and fences to be erected
in front of buildings in course of con
struction. The enacting clause follows:
The Board of Public Works yesterday
issued peremptory orders to the build
ing inspectors and the outside men em
ployed in the City Architect's office to
see to it that two ordinances relating
to building construction be complied
with by building contractors. The two
laws have been practically dead letters
during the past, and their non-enforce
ment has resulted in much inconven
ience both to vehicular and pedestrian
traffic wherever buildings are being
erected.
The board adjourned until 9:30 o'clock
this morning, after declaring that pen
alties may be materially raised each
year, so that assessments may be in
creased as high as 25 per cent on those
who fail to conform to the law.
The . estate of Samuel Davis was
given an assessment of $450,000. Julius
Reis, executor of Davis" will, filed a
statement to the effect that the total
value of the property, excepting real
estate, is $135,133. Dodge's assessment
was ordered to stand. Rudolph
Spreekels was assessed $30,000; Henry
T. Scott and Charles E. Green, guard
ians of the estate of Jennie A. and
Charles T. Crocker, was assessed $373.
883: W. H. Crocker, for furniture at
1130 California street, was assessed
$S0,0OO; Charles Crocker, for furniture,
was assessed $20,000. There were nu
merous assessments of smaller
amounts.
Daniel Meyer, the well-known
banker, headed the list with an as
sessment of $1,000,000. According: to Dr.
Dodge, ileyer invariably neglects to
make a statement of his personal prop
erty, the nature of his business being
such that sooner than Indulge the
names of his clients he leaves the as
sessment entirely to the mercy of the
Assessor.
Supervisor Eggers moved, and it was
adopted, that Meyer's assessement be
raised $250,000, but on the arrival of
Supervisor Braunhart the matter was
reconsidered, Braunhart feeling that
every one should be treated with equal
consideration.
After numerous proposed resolutions,
it was resolved ultimately that in all
cases arbitrarily of persona assessed
for J1000 or over where parties have
failed to moke a sworn statement, or
to appear before the board, the assess
ment shall be a per cent unless good
cause can be shown to the contrary.
The Board of Supervisors met yester
day as a board of equalization and the
matter of the day was the consider
ation of arbitrary assessments made
by Dr. Washington Dodge.
A number of prominent citizens have
failed to make a return of their per
sonal property to the Assessor, as re
quired by law, which left the Assessor
the right to determine the value him
self.

The transfer of the Canton-Hankow Rail
road from Americans U> Belgians has had a
bad effect on American trade in that country
This transfer was contrary to the desires of
the Chinese, who were anxious to have it in
American control. They are suspicious of any
ether control than American, for they have
confidence that the United States will not at
tempt to grab anything.
Pierce reports that the consular ser
vice is in very good shape, but he is
in favor of Government ownership of
its own legation quarters. It now owns
the legation property at Peking, Seoul
and Tokio. He also said that the
diplomatic and consular service is in
adequately paid, a fact which prevents
the Government from getting better
material for its foreign representation.
Regarding trade conditions in the
Orient, Secretary Pierce said:
It seems to me that our opportunities for
trade in China and Japan are enormous The
difficulty Is in getting Americans to Invest
their capital so far away from home. The
officials in the Kastern countries are favorable
to American enterprises. There are endless
opportunities for American young men In the
Far East, especially In China although there
ar* also many in Janan
When seen last evening Secretary
Pierce denied that he had had any un
pleasantness on the Mongolia and de
clared that Captain Rinder was one of
his best friends. He referred his inter
viewers to the manager of the steam
ship company for further indorsement
of his statements and then entered
upon a discussion of his official trip.
Secretary Peirce and his wife
promptly left the captain's table and
for a time it was expected that they
would not reappear in the dining hall.
The following day, however, they were
there, but occupied a separate table,
which they continued to use during the
remainder of the trip. As the Mon
golia neared the harbor the cabin pas
sengers wen*, into caucus with the idea
of anticipating any possible action that
Secretary Peirce might take against
Captain Rinder when the ship docked,
for it had been reported that Peirce
had been making threats. At the meet
ing a resolution, cleverly worded so
that its real purport could not be mis
taken, was adopted.
This commended the officers of the
Mongolia for their attentions to the
passengers during the trip and paid a
deserved compliment to the steward's
department. When Pierce heard of the
resolution, it is said that he endeavored
to have it suppressed, but failed. Yes
terday* when the Mongolia docked, the
story of Pierce's experiences aboard
the vessel was quickly told on the
wharf, where he was kept watting for
some time while his baggage was being
passed.
Later in the day, after he had reached
the Palace Hotel,- several Americans
who had crossed the ocean with him
and keenly appreciated the need of pro
tecting his official dignity made an at
tempt to have the story and resolutions
quashed, but their efforts were fruit
less.
Apparently, however, nothing on the
Mongolia was satisfactory to Peirce,
who, it is said, showed no hesitancy- in
evincing his displeasure regarding any
thing that seemingly pleased the other
passengers. Eventually the Secretary's
unpleasant manner became a matter
of general comment and not a few of
the passengers, who had tolerated his
"kicking" to a degree which seemed
unbearable, turned their wits to
schemes for '"joshing" the official and
making him the butt of all kinds of
jokes.
When Honolulu was reached Secre
tary Peirce, after complaining of
everything in the larder of the ship,
conceived the idea of laying in a sup
ply of provisions of his own and
promptly carried out his plan. Xext
morning at breakfast he called the
steward and requested that he deliver
to him one of a number of eggs
which had been personally selected for
the Secretary in Honolulu the day be
fore. The order was served and Sec
retary Peirce was congratulating him
self over the fact that he had "some
thing fresh," when the cracking of
the egg shell revealed a yelk that was
rapidly disappearing under a covering
of pin feathers. Of course every one â
that is, every one but the Secretary â
laughed, while he stormed loudly. The
incident ended in Captain Rinder say
ing some rather stern things to his
guest. He reminded Peirce that while,
as a Government oificial, he was en
titled to every courtesy, there were
other passengers whose comforts and
peace of mind had to be considered
and that as commander of the Mon
golia it was his own duty to insist
that the Secretary deport himself in
a manner not quite so offensive to his
fellow travelers.
Peirce's troubles began aboard the
Mongolia shortly after the big new ves
sel had started from the Orient and
continued until the Golden Gate was
sighted. As was due his position as
a national representative, whom the
Emperor of Japan saw fit to recognize
during the visit of the Secretary in
Tokio, CaiHain Kinder of the Mongolia
properly made the distinguished trav
eler and his wife a guest at his table
In the dining hall and endeavored to
afford them every i>ossible comfort
aboard ship.
Among the more notables aboard the
steamship Mongolia, "which arrived
from the Orient yesterday, was Her
bert H. D. Peirce, Third Assistant Sec
retary of State, who has been making
a tour of .inspection of the United
States Consulates in the Far East.
This culminated, on the return trip, in
probably the most disagreeable experi
ence the Washington official has had
during his career as a public charac
ter.
Among the arrivals at the Palace
from the Far East yesterday was
Kiogo Ishii. commissioner from Japan
to t'.e Curfew Congress to be held in
St. Louis and also representing the
Interior, Agricultural and Commerce
departments of that country. In the
latter capacity he will visit the more
important packing centers of this
country with a view to studying the
American methods of killing cattle
and packing meat for market. He is
accompanied by his brother and K.
Takenouchi, manager of the Kosaka
mine, who has been commissioned ,to
make a tour of inspection of the min
ing districts of this country.
To Study Meat Packers' Methods.
The members of the expedition are
highly pleased with the result of their
many months of hard work. They
will rest here a few days and then pro
ceed to the East.
We also visited the center of Buddhist wor
ship in China and by order of the district
magistrate we were well entertained.
Oar party carried out its survey work with
the ordinary instruments, which occasioned
much curlostty among the natives. We made
geological collections, of which the natives had
no understanding and there was good reason
for anticipating that their xuperstitious fears
might be aroused against us. Only on one
occasion, however, when observations were be
ing made at night on the stars, did we create
any popular feeling against us. Our work
caused considerable uneasiness among the Chi
nese, who reported that we were waving a
flaming torch at the skies and were calling
down on the people the curses of the gods.
Their fears wore finally quieted by an official
proclamation explaining the purpose of our
work and giving assurance that our mission
meant no harm to the neople.
During tho nin<> month* we were. In the
Orient we tn -led through a large portion of
the- Interior of China end were treated moat
courteously by the people. Our route through
Northwestern and Western Central China com
prised jibout 500 miles, the greater portion of
which waÂ« away from ordinary lines of travel,
and where the natives were not familiar with
foreigners, yet we experienced little trouble
with them. We went through the province of
Shensl. Here, in 1900, all the missionaries
were murdered, yet we were n<^ disturbed, and
in Phensl province the expedition traversed a
district where there is a state of scarcity
bcrderlne on a famine.
I readily recall one experience during our
trip which I think clearly shows" the change
of reÂ»llng In that country. While traveling
1 was Â«toned by a Chinese, a fact which 1
immediately reported to the magistrate of the
district, who promptly caused the assailant
to be arrested and brought before him. Much
to my surprise the dignitary requested me to try
the case and suggetit the punishment. ' I did
Â»> and having apparently t*atl?tied the magis
trate, of the guilt of the prisoner. 1 suddenly
surprised the accused and startled the magis
trate by announcing that I purposed to in
terpret the law as it is construed In an Amer
ican court. I ordered the prisoner liberated
and I can still plainly picture in my mind
the look of gratitude he bextowed upon me
when he learned the result of his trial.
My amazed friend, the magistrate, then de
manded from me my reasons for not adminis
tering severe punishment to the pri^ner. 1
explained that I could not positively Identify
the accused, inasmuch as I had not Â«een him
In the act of throwing the missile. The just
ness of American law, It Is hardly necessary
to eay, strongly appealed to the magistrate, but
I dare stay it pleased the accused most, for
the world Is pretty familiar with the manner
in which punishment if meted out in the
courts of China. In this same district four
years ago a magistrate before whom four for
eigners were brought ordered them out and
had them murdered.
I mention these facts as a suggestion that
the feeling of the Chinese against foreigners
has materially changed plnee the Boxer war.
ThosH> familiar with the conditions before and
after the Uoxer trouble looK on the result of
that affair as one that will benefit the nation
through the recognition by the Chinese of the
fact that foreigners could overcome them at
any critical time In the future.
Bailey Willis of the United States
Geological Department in Washington,
Eliot Black welder, instructor of geol
ogy in the University of Chicago, and
R. H. Sargent, chief topographer of the
Geological Department, who composed
the expedition, created under a grant
from the Carnegie Institution of Wash
ington, for a geological and geographi
cal survey of Eastern Asia, returned
yesterday from the Orient and are
registered at the Palace. They left
this country in June, 1903, going by
way of Europe and the Trans-Siberian
Railroad to China, where they spent
nine months in pursuit of scientific in
formation and achieved great success
in their undertaking.
The expedition was specially com
mended to China by this Government
through its Minister at Peking and as
it had only scientific objects in view
the imperial authorities cordially as
sisted it in many ways. To this fact
the scientists testify in a manner that
plainly suggests their gratitude to the
Chinese Government. In speaking of
the expedition Air. Willis said last

BERKELEY. July 15.â A mountain
lion is roaming the hills back of
Schmidtville, a hamlet just north of
Berkeley on the San Pablo road, and
a posse of farmers, loaded with rifles
and other things just as deadly, are
on his trail. To those who have seen
the brute his dimensions seem to be
enormous, though seasoned lion-hunt
ers say that the largest of them never
measures more than eight feet from
tip to tip.
The farmers of Schmidtville are
after the lion because the lion has
been after their calves and sheep.
They thought at first that the coyotes
were getting bold and committing the
deeds, but the peculiar methods of the
destroyer have forced them to change
their minds. It seems that the beast
does not eat the flesh of his victims at
all, merely their blood, which he sucks
out of a wound In the throat.

In the meantime, the Masons, who
huO responded to the warning of the
Chambers sisters, had hurriedly
dressed and prepared to remove some
of their things from the house. With
the assistance cf the Misses Chambers
and their neighbors the Masons saved
most of their furniture, but In so doing
Mrs. Mason nearly lost her life, for in
some unaccountable way she got
caught In a closet from which she could
not escape without assistance. It seems
that a catch on the cutside was sprung
bo that the door was locked, thus defy
ing the frantic efforts of the imprison
ed woman to open It.
It was while Mrs. Mason was in this
dilemma that Miss Loutse Chambers
again proved herself a heroine. Above
the roar of the flames that were fast
devouring the house Miss Chambers
heard the despairing screams of Mrs.
Mason, and without a thought ,pf the
danger to herself hurried to the rescue.
She leaped fearlessly through a bank
of flames toward the closet and a mo
ment later sprung the latch back and
freed Mrs. Mason, who was now- so
weak that she had to be half dragged
and half carried to the street, where
she was revived. Mrs. Mason said aft
erward that it was only Miss Cham
bers' heroism that saved her life.
The fire left both families homeless
and It was necessary'for neighbors to
supply them with food and clothing.
The loss Is about $5000, with little in
surance. The Masc-ns had only occu
pied their house three weeks.
The fire was discovered in the resi
dence of Mrs. Katherine Gilligan .at
1323 Ashby avenue at 4 o'clock this
morning by the Misses Chambers, who
live in the neighborhood. They rushed
to the scene and warned Mrs. Gilligan
and Miss Judge, her sister, and then
hurried next door to- the' home of Mr.
and Mrs. William L. Mason, which was
in danger of destruction on account of
Its proximity to the burning house.
By the time all this was performed
the Gilligan house was a mass of
flames, with absolutely no chance of
saving any of the furnishings. It was
all that Mrs. Gilligan and Miss Judge
could do to save the five Gilligan chil
dren, in the rescue of wnom Mias Judge
exhibited so much heroism. The three
eldest children were taken to safety
Easily enough, but in the hurry the two
babes were almost forgotten. When
it was almost too late Miss Judge hur
ried back into the burning building
and grabbing the children from their
cribs, rushed into the street, just in
time to escape a crash of falling tim
bers.

Dr. Kroeber was called as an expert
at the Coroner's inquest held at Hay
wards by Justice of the Peace Charles
Prowse, who acted for Coroner Mehr
mann. He said that from the condition
of the bones and the character of the
soil in which they were found he
judged the skeletons had been buried
at least luO years.
The principal witness besides Dr.
Kroeber and his assistant. Professor
Joseph Peterson, was William Gall, the
assistant postmaster at Mount Eden,
who was the discoverer of the skele
tons. Gall testified that he had un
earthed the bones while digging a cel
lar under the saloon. After the dis
covery of the bones he had notified Dr.
Kroeber, who sent Professor Peterson
to Mount Eden to investigate the find.
After hearing the testimony the
Coroner's Jury returned the following
verdict:
Yl*e, the Jury, do find that the human bones
In question were unearthed at Mount Kden,
in cald county of Alameda, during the mouthy
ot May and June. l!i04, between five and

The mystery surrounding the discov
ery of two /human skeletons beneath
Henry Crocker's saloon at Mount Eden
was cleared up this afternoon, when
Dr. Alfred Kroeber, instructor in the
department of anthropology at the
University of California, who had sub
jected the bones to a searching exam
ination, testified that the skeletons
were undoubtedly those of California
Digger Indians.

FRIDAY. JLLY 13
When the wrecking train crew ar
rived the burning cars were uncoupled,
from the others, which prevented a
spread of the flames. It was too late
then to save the burning ones and this
morning they were a mas3 of charred
timbers.
The fire was discovered at 2 o'clock
by Robert Jones, the operator at Cor
bin Station, who organized a fire
brigade and summoned help by wire
from all directions. Jones and Albert
Coons, a watchman for the railroad,
tried to quench the flames with buckets
of water, but could do nothing on ac
count of the high wind blowing. It
was a half hour before engines re
sponded to the alarm from West Oak
land and by that time ten of the cars
were burning fiercely and threatening
to communicate their fiamea to the oth
er cars and the furniture factory. All
that saved the factory was that the
wind was blowing the flames away
from it.
Fire broke out among 200 freight car.-*
on a siding in West Berkeley last night
and destroyed ten of them before the
flames had their fill, causing a losn to
the Southern Pacific Company of $1000.
at least. That the whole lot was not
destroyed and the plant of the West
Berkeley Furniture Factory, with its
$230,000 worth of buildinga and stock,
is due largely to the activity of the
employes cf the railroad, who fought
against great odds an/1 with little t->
help them. The fire is supposed to have
been caused by tramps.

The Ciir Auditor to-day received all
estimates of expenses with which to
conduct the various branches of the
city government during the present
fiscal year. The increased appropria
tions asked for over those of last year
amount to nearly $120,000. Just how
much of this additional amount will
be allowed Is not known, but it is
expected that over one-half of the
amount will be awarded, the money
asked for being for necessary purposes.
Superintendent of Streets Ott asks
for $250,029, which i3 an increase of
about S77.000. Much new street work
is contemplated, and the cost of sprink
ling new highways will be increased.
Money is also asked for grading, pav
ing and sewer work, and the City
Council is favorable .to having all the
work done. The Police Department
wants X113.6S4 and fifteen additional
patrolmen. The increase asked is $30,
553. The rapid strides taken in the
growth of th" city and the necessity for
more protection to life and property is
responsible for the request.
The improvements in the Fire De
partment will call for more money and
5148,368 80 is asked for. The Board of
Education asks for $5000 more than
it did last year. Its total amount is
J&79.8T9. The Board of Health asks
$l&90 more than last year, the City
Councll a total of $20,000, and the City
Wharfinger ?9023 50. There is but little
increase asked In the estimates of the
Auditor, Treasnrer, City Clerk and Po
lice Courts.

Heads of departments are hereby notified
to report promptly all casea of Intoxication in
their departments. Notice Is hereby given
that in ev;ry case whÂ»re an employe becomes
Intoxktted while en duty he will be sum
marily dij'mifj-ed and no excuse of any kind
Will be considered.
An edict has gone forth that means
much to those who tamper with the
flowing bowl while performing service
In Oakland as firemen or policemen.
The Board of Police and Fire Commis
sioners issued a stern warning at a
meeting this afternoon, and from this
date every member cf either depart
jnent found Intoxicated will be sum
marily dismissed and no excuses for
their conduct will be accepted.
The positive stand taken by the board
is the resalt of the recent case of
Thomas M^rrick, a policeman. Merriek
lost his star on the ground that he was
unfit to perform duty owins to his in
toxicated condition, but later came for
ward with a defense that paregoric and
not whisky was responsible for his
trouble. Two of the members of the
police board were in favor of reinstat
ing him, and this was done at a re
cent meeting. The case created a great
deal of discussion. The board resolved
to emphasize its position on matters of
intoxication. The resolution that will
bring ill to offenders in this regard Is
as follows:

A private detective saw Stowe this
rveninjj talking with a young fellow
who had deserted from the navy and
he at once concluded that Stowe was
a deserter and took him into custody
and lodged him in the County Jail.
The authorities at Mare Island have
been notified and he will be tak^n
there fn the morning.
Sitting in the jail, attired in his* new
railway uniform, Stowe bore himself
as ony who had done the best he knew
how and had l*?en vanquished. He
thinks that when he tolls hi? story the
naval authorities will deal lightly with
him, but he dreeds the delay. He can
not earn money while in confinement,
and the nay he gets in thÂ«* navy is so
unall that it is not sufficient for his
Eist^-r's support.
He arrived herÂ» on the 3d of July and
made an application for work at the
Southern Pacific offices and the next
day was given a position as gateman on
the Seventh-street local train in Oak
land. Each week, as he drew his
money, he sent some of it back to hi?
sister, but his remittances must now
ftop.
He was afraid to stay there for fear
that he would be caught, so as soon as
he had a taik with her he told her that
he would go to work and earn enough
money to support her and the next
morning took a train back to San
Francisco.
Young Stowe is just 21 himself, and
as soon as he left the cruiser he
boarded a. train and in three days was
in Kansas City. His parents are both
dead and his sister had had a home
with her grandfather, but he died a
week before Stowe reached Kansas
City. ThÂ£ runaway found his sister all
alone.
"My sister is only 17 years old," he
paid, "and wrote to me from Kansas
City and told me I had to hflp her. I
would have had to wait three weeks to
get a leave of absence, so left without
getting it."
Because his sister was in dire dis
tress and alone in the world and needed
his assistance, Warren C. Stowe .de
serted from the United States cruiser
Boston, at Mare Island, three weeks
ago and this evening was captured and
must go back and answer for his of
fense before the naval authorities.

It is not known just what steps
should be taken, and dispatches are
being sent all over the State for the
purpose of locating the State veterin
ary. He is at present absent from
Sacramento and cannot be found.
Veterinary Donnelly says he has no au
thority In the matter and refuses to do
anything further than give his opinion.
One Lewis, as soon as it was pointed
out to him that his horse had the
glanders, kiiled the animal for fear
that hip family might become infected.
OthT horse owners refuse to destroy
their animals. Seven of the worst cases,
however, have been held for inspection
for the State veterinary when he ar
rives. Roth Niles and Centerville have
cases and it is not known how far the
malady has spread. Owners named
Oliveira and Dazzell have horses which
are infected and b^jipve th-?y can trace
it back to an old sorrel horse given
Oliveira by 'White Hat" McCarthy.
That animal is now in an advanced
stage of the disease and two horses
with which it has been working have
both become infected. As goon as
Dimmer arrives the infected district
will undergo a thorough examination.
Glanders has broken out among the
horses at Centerville and Miles, and the
local and State authorities have a dif
ficult problem before them. State
Veterinarian Blemmer has not yet
been communicated with. In the mean
time it i3 feared that the dread disease
has become wide spread. Seven horses
have been quarantined and there are
many others that are showing the same
symptoms. District- Attorney Allen
sent Veterinary Surgeon G. J. Donnelly
to make a special examination. Don
nelly has reported that the disease is
undoubtedly the glanders.

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
A dispatch from San Pedro." dated July IS.
says that Cnptain Hansen of the schooner
William Smith, arriving to-day from Astoria,
reports that on the evening of July 13 he
eighted a large bark, eastbound twenty miles
west northwest of Santa Barbara Island, with
the foretop and maintop gallantmast gone to
the eyes of the topmast rigging.
Captain Hansen' could not make out the ves
sel's name, but he Is of the opinion that she
was the American bark Willncott. Captain
Macloon, out 3.12 days from Philadelphia for
San Diego with a cargo of coal. She flew
no signals and was apparently in no distrtas.
but was making good progress on her course
with a fair wind. When sighted she was
only partly loaded. This would Indicate that
she was the Willseott. as this bark, on Janu
ary 15. discharged three hundred tons of coal
at Port Stanley, Falkland Inlands, where she
had called, 6lightly damaged. She sailed from
that port on January 26. If the bark sighted
was the missing Willseott she should make
San Diego to-night or to-morrow morning.
Captain Wilson of the schooner "Willie R.
Hume sighted the bark on the came date and
verifies Captain Hansen's story.
The Willseott Spoken Damngcd.

The Mongolia is 29 days from Hong
kong, 16 days SU hours from Yokohama
and Z days 19 hours from Honolulu.
The following are the 248 cabin passen
gers:
In that great vessel were 781 passen
gers, of whom 472 were Asiatics; $1,855,
000 of treasure and 11.143 tons of
freight. There were COS bags of mail on
board. This is the last half of the
Mongolia's maiden voyage and a record
trip in profit to the Pacific Mail Com
pany.
"When the huge Pacific Mail liner
Mongolia came slowly into harbor yes
terday morning from the Orient and let
fall her anchor off Meiggs wharf the
ships and steamers already here were
schooners and launches in comparison.
She stopped near the steamship Uma
tilla â no small boat herself â and the
Pacific Coast craft could have been
taken for the big one's tender.
Fourths of July. The passengers ex
hibited a double degree of patriotic
enthusiasm. The story of the revolt
against the British mother country was
a twice-told tale. Each orator spoke
his piece over again. The Declaration
of Independence was re-read and the
marshal of the day was In duplicate.
Many of the celebrators before the fes
tivities were over saw double. A warm
political campaign was started. All the
parties that could get recognitionâ
and every thing was recognized at that
period â had their nominees in the field
and the din of their electioneering was
loud. The candidates of the "Woman's
.Suffrage party, by reason of their
ability to say much and say it last, ap
peared to be in the lead on the eve of
election. When the ballots were
counted the Union Labor party had
elected J. J. Keegan President and H.
J. Rosecrans Vice President of the
United States with a plurality of 2600.
There were only 426 voters at the polls.

GIANT PACIFIC MAIL LINER MONGOLIA WHICH ARRIVED FROM THE FAR EAST YESTHRDAT. COMPLETING HER
FIRST ROUND TRIP FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO ORIENTAL PORTS. SHE BRINGS HUNDREDS OF PASSENGERS. A
MILLION DOLLARS OF TREASURE AND MORE THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND TONS OF FREIGHT. I
In answer tcr Captain Irvine, the wit
ness Farley said that from 10:45 p. m.
until 11:03 p. m. on April 9 the ship
had been going on fifty-four revolu
tions per minute. Then the order was
given for fifty revolutions, which speed
Â¦was maintained until the ship struck.
Inspector Bulger offered to have
Stevens brought back from Nevada to
testify again, but the engineers said
that they did not wish him.
"You three engineers are on trial,"
eaid Captain Bulger, "with regard to
your drinking. If you want any wit
nesses called on your behalf you may
have them."
The accusod men said that they did
rot wish any witnesses.
Daniel Farlej-. third assistant en
gineer, raid that he was also in the
storeroom and saw a bottle of whisky
opened, but did not see anybody taste
it. He drank ginger ale himself and
eaw Chief Sullivan and Assistant En
rineer Sullivan drinking the same. The
witness said that Second Assistant En
gineer Campbell relieved him at mid
night. Campbell was "perfectly sober."
"Did you tell any one," asked Cap
tain Eulger, "after you got into San
Francisco that you had a good time on
board the ship?"
This the witness denied.
Captain Bulger questioned the men
sharply. M. D. Sullivan, firt-t assistant
engineer, testified that he was not
aware that the men' were drinking on
board the Colon. He said that he had
been in the storekeeper's room and had
takon one glass of ginger ale. Chief
Engineer W. E. D. Sullivan, he de
clared, was there also, but drank only
Ringer ale. He saw no champagne on
that occasion.
My addreys i? Fort Churchill. Nevada. If
you wart me further, a letter will reach me.
and I will come on thÂ» first train, as I court
the fullest inquiry, ar.d there might be other
an** of perjury as the outcome.
As I said before and ray now. nobody Is
sorrier the thins occurred than I. but they,
to save, themselves, have endeavored to have
me arrrsted for pqfuiy, fcr. if forced. I can
pmvÂ» that what I i=a:d is absolutely true.
Tn*\ and If I would to back and tell you
that I had made a mistake and say that he
did not touch any liquor, I would not be
Forty for so doinff. I immediately to'.d Third
Officer Taylor of the proposition and decided
rot to ircntlon the matter any further.
]~urthermore. that afti-r I gave my testimony
<"h;rf Engineer Sullivan came to me in the
hail near your office and told me he ex
l^cted to receive pome money from a rela-
New, ceTitlemen, I did not. on the witness
Ftand voiuntfer any information, but an
*uftÂ»d all qneatlflBa put to me by yourselves
Bi Dearly correct aÂ« I remembered, and I will
Â«<id now liiat every word I uttered was true.
Yesterday Captain Bulger read an
affidavit dated at Churchill, Nevada,
and f=worn to by the storekeeper, reit
erating his testimony as to the drunk
enness of the engine room crew. The
affidavit proceeds as fellows:
F'irst of all. so far as r"?crgirg Captain
Irvinr'F ntme to an crdrr for be<r. or, in fact.
er.y other thing ir concerned, Carey haF told
â¢ willful and malicious lie. and 1 challenge
h : rr. or any or.e fiseTtt produce rame. In fact.
If he ran prove that I ever did. I will ac
knowledge that all the testimony eiven by
tne was rcrjured.
The Colon ran upon Remedios Reef,
between San Jose de Guatemala and
Acajutla, at 4:56 a. rn. on April 11. At
the former session of the board it was
shown that Captain William Irvine had
lost his reckoning because, as he al
leged. Chief Engineer Sullivan had not
obeyed his orders as to the number of
revolutions to be made by the engines.
On the other hand, Sullivan had as
â¢toutly affirmed that the captain had
ordered fifty-four revolutions on leav
ine San Jose and that shortly there
after he had changed it to fifty-one.
After further proceedings yesterday
the case went over until July 28, whpn
Steerage Steward T. Jordan and Sec
ond Assistant Engineer Campbell are
expected to be present.
The investigation hinges upon the
problem whether or not the engineer
and his assistants were drunk or sobpr
during the forty-eisht houVs precedir.j?
the wreck. Harry G. Ftevens, the
storekeeper, had testified that all
hands, with the exception of the cap
tain, were drunk because of undue re
joicing over the wedding of First Mate
Wilson.
The investigation into the wrecking
of the steamship Colon, which was ad
journed a few weeks ago, was resumed
yesterday morning by United States
Steamship Inspectors Captains O. F.
Bolles and J. K. Bulger.
Movements of Steamers.
The combination of the San Francisco
.and Portland Steamship Company and
the Portland and .Asiatic Steamship
Company does not foreshadow any rad
ical change In existing conditions. It is
explained that the consolidation will
enable the steamships of the two
present lines to be used interchangably
to mf?et emergencies. When there are
heavy freights to be moved in any di
rection the vessels will be available im
mediately to handle the business. Jt. P.
Sc'nwerin will be the vice president of
the new company to be formed by con
solidation and also its general man
ager.
The line had sufficient steamships to
swamp out any ordinary competitor at
cut rates, should there.be any attempt
to put on a. competing steamship line
on the Coast. ' -
Â¦ The business of the (j3an Francisco
and Portland Steamship Company and
the Portland and Asiatic Steamship
Company is about to be consolidated.
A new corporation will soon be formed
under the name of the Portland and
San Francisco Steamship Company for
the purpose of handling all the busi
ness that Is now divided between the
two Harriman lines. The San Fran
cisco and Portland Steamship Company
is a part of the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company.ythat has been
kept for the purpose of fighting, out
any competition that might be offered
to the O. PL and N. railway business
to Portland, and keeping up the sea
rate between Portland and San Fran
cisco.

from Esopus to Judge Parker's house, the news
paper correspondents have been equipped with high
power field glasses and located in the hills overlooking
the candidatial residence. The millinery of the lady
members of his family is under public scrutiny and a
ground plan and front elevation of his coachman has
been secured for use in an emergency.
Those, however, are not all the signs of activity at
the front. Two nights after his nomination the candi
date, at the dead hour of 1 a .m.. heard the sound of
hoofs in his barnyard. He arose, found and lighted a
candle, and in his dignified shirt tail went out the back
door to sec what was the matter. One of his coach
horses had got loose and was in the yard. The Judge
sought to catch him and with' the candle in one hand
and persuasion in the other followed the hackney round
and round the barnyard unsuccessfully. That horse had
more sense than the St. Louis convention. He demanded
a declaration, of intentions before he was caught.

THE FIGHT IS ON.
The disaster which occurred in the
Paris "underground" less than a year
h go has proved a costly matter for the
Metropolitan Company, lessee of the
line. Compensation cost close upon
$235,000 and loss of traffic amounted to
o\er $160,000. The total income of the
railway for the year was $3,530,000, and
of this, under the terms of the conces
sion granted by the Paris municipality,
there has had to be handed over to the
relief of the city rates the sum of $1,
140,000. Then, after deducting the work
ing expenses, which were in the neigh
borhood of $1,500,000 (42 percent of the
receipts), it was possible to give a divi
dend of about 6 per cent. The year has
been one of great moment to the Paris
company in the matter of capital ex
penditure tipoh the new power station,
the conversion of the system of elec
tiically working the trams to multiple
unit, etc., and a great deal of new roll
ing stock is now in course of building.
The lighting and traction supplies are
dow effected by entirely separate cir
cuits, so that in future the stoppage of
a train through failure of the power
circuit will not mean that there will be
no light available â a matter which will
be remembered was one of the chief
causes of the panic at Paris. The un
dertaking so far completed represents
about twenty-two miles out of the
twenty-six miles which constitute the

WhÂ«*n the late Professor Somraer
ville of the University of Pennsylvania,
the learned collector of gems, charms
and mascots, had set his mind on some
curio heard of in one of his meetings
with Orientals, nothing could bar the
way. Were it in the center of the
desert of Sahara or on the topmost
pinnacle of the Himalayan mountains,
he would go after it and keep up the
search until the treasure was found,
purchased and placed on exhibition
at the university museum-
American gold was Professor Som
xnerville'B magnet wherever he went.
He thus describes its efforts on one of
his expeditions:
"On one occasion we desired to visit
the famous Dilwarra temples In India
and for that purpose 'engaged two Jin
jikishas and a number of natives to
draw them, about twelve in all. The
temples, as you know, are' set In a
magnificent grove of mango trees on a
mountain top and surrounded by great
hills. With a fair measure of tact and
money I hoped to secure from the peo
ple of the vicinity some of their odd
talismans and rings. Â¦ I said to the
chief rikisha man: '.Vow, La la, what
will you do for me if I double your
IÂ»ay? I want to make this journey in
half time, and if you accomplish It
you shall be doubly paid.'

If we allow fifty years for the maxi
mum average of useful life, the ten
minutes' saving on each of one-half
the messages of the 1902 telephone ser
vice would aggregate the entire life
time for purposes of work of more
than 956 able-bodied men employed as
messengers. By as much as we should
vary the assumed average saving of
time per message our totals would in
crease or decrease. Probably ten min
utes per message is far below the fig
ure which would be warrantedâElec
trical World. â¢
From the figures given it appears
that in 1902 there were something more
than five thousand millions of tele
phone messages exchanged in the
United States. If it is assumed that
half the messages sent were sent be
cause it was merely convenient, there
remain two thousand five hundred
millions of necessary communications,
of consequence as affecting the busi
ness or social activities of the Ameri
can people. To find Â« ut how much time
was saved we must assume an arbi
trary average. On long-distance mes
sages this might run into days for
each communication. On nearby calls
It might be but minutes. If we assume,
as we may safely do, that the saving
of time on each necessary communi
cation in asking the question and get
ting an answer, or o~ imparting or re
ceiving Information, will average at
least ten minutes by telephone over
any other available agency of commu
nication, we find that the saving on
the two thousand five hundred mil
lions of messages of the exigent and
important class exchanged in 1902 was
twenty-five thousand million 'minutes,
or 416.CC6.666 hours, or 17,361,111 days, or

As to procuring a charge, the thing
has none of the stock exchange sim
plicity, where the main requirement for
getting a seat is to be able to pay for
it. Here a candidate must be a French
man and at least 25 years old. He
must have served four years in, certain
forms of business. He must be per
sonally acceptable to the agent from
whom he would purchase the seat and
often to his family, including the
women. He must be passed upon by
the seventy with formal voting, as if he
were joining some select club, which
he is. There must be no stain on his
business record, and no slur on his per
sonal character. A candidate was re

other for no fault of his own, but be

It may be said that a seat among
the seventy (they call it a charge) costs
about 3,000.000 francs ($000,000), or
sometimes 2,500,000, and* a charge earns
from 5 to 15 per cent (net) a year,
so that the annual profits are from
$30,000 to $90,000, or more in exceptional
years. But these are usually divided
among several associates, for it rarely
happens that an agent is the sole own
er of his seat. More often he has paid
for only half of it or a third of it, and
has three or four silent partners who
own the rest and who may again have
subpartners, so that you will hear of a
person owning an eighth or a sixteenth
of a seat, or even a thirty-second, these

It was different in the campaign of
1SS5 in Manchuria. The forced marches
were most trying: <he winter was se
vere, the number of forced marches
was considerable. A large proportion
of the rank and file and not a few of
ficers marched in the little straw san
dals of the country, which were per
fect during that season, but incapable
of withstanding the intense cold as
prevails in Manchuria during the win

"This just consideration of hy
giene." he says In conclusion, "will no
doubt have it* weight with the the
orists of strategy, who settle battles
and victories upon paper." It must
not, nevertheless, be forgotten that in
the days of old Napoleon won battles
with the legs of his "gognards," and
in the present day, on the plains of
Manchuria, victory â¢will perhaps fall
to the lot of the army which has the

In the campaign of 1900, when the
Japanese troops had no long marches,
this feature of the feet in shoes had
rot much opportunity of displaying
itself.
Unfortunately. western civiliza

the rising sum, has prevented the Jap

COMMENTING on the prospectus issued by the
Citrus Union, The Call directed attention to its
proposition to promote the cash sale of citrus
fruits in California by encouraging the buyers to appear
where the crop is. The great leak in the orchard profits
of this State occurs between the consumer, and the pro
ducer. That leak is not due to freight charges, which
are a known quantity, and do not account for ,the eva T
poration of what the consumer pays before it reaches
the producer. The trouble is that the producer is com
pelled to take all the risks of the business until the
fruit is in the mouth of the eater.
Cash sales at the shipping point nearest the orchard
would end the grower's risk there and he could go home
with his cash in his pocket, knowing just what he had,
without lying awake pondering the problem of who
would rob him most, and how. If the Citrus Union or
any other organization can approximate this desirable
condition it should be encouraged. It was with that
view that we enlarged knowledge of its I purposes. In
doing this we were only promoting a commercial prin
ciple that is of the greatest importance to all the pro
ducers of perishable property. They have nothing to
say about the cost of carrying it, nor about the final
price to the consumer/ They lose control of it entirely
when it goes into the cars. Yet it continues at their
risk until its final consumption.
Everybody who touches it between the producers and
the consumers'* makes money out of it. T,he railroads take
their freight charge in advance. The middleman takes
his commission. The boxmaker ..takes his. cash in ad
vance for his boxes. The producers pay cash to every
body else with whom they deal in picking, packing and
transporting their fruit, and it is the most wasteful and
unbusinesslike system that compels *them to give up
possession of their property without getting cash for it.
It is so easy to misunderstand a newspaper and to
ascribe to it a sinister motive, that we seem to have
been misunderstood in this. We are in receipt of a
letter from a member of the Southern California Fruit
Exchange which opens the subject by saying: "I was
surprised to read in your paper of June 28 your edi
torial entitled 'Cash for Fruit.' You seem to be under
some misapprehension as to the personality of the Citrus
Union and the amount of fruit controlled by them."
Then follows an exposition which it is not necessary
to reproduce, by which it appears that the shipments .this
year have been divided as follows: Southern California
Fruit Exchange, 46 per cent; Citrus Union, 32 per cent;
Independents, 22 per cent.
The writer continues: "I inclose circular issued by the
Southern California Fruit Exchange, as I feel sure that
you do not wish to use your great influence in damaging
the cause of co-operation among growers. There is no
question as to the advisability, of selling our fruit for
cash in California, but this much is desired and can be
obtained only when the large majority of the growers
see the wisdom of combining their interests with their
fellow growers in a co-operative organization, such as
the exchange."
Now, without enforcing the suggestion that it is natu
ral for a man to see salvation only in his own taber
nacle, we desire to say that' whoever may or whatever
organization can advance the orchard interest by foster
ing cash transactions in California will have our support.
It is the commercial principle for which we contend,
not for any special instrument for its accomplishment.
We are even willing to be criticized unjustly if that
will aid in such agitation as will inspire the combined
wits of the producers to seek ways and means by which
their fruit will mean cash at the shipping station, just
as the Eastern farmers' wheat, corn, oats and livestock
mean cash at the nearest railroad point.
If co-operation will help, by all means co-operate, but
we beg to suggest to our correspondent that co-opera
tion is not best secured under the sectional banner of
the "Southern California Fruit Exchange." The North
ern Citrus Growers have an appreciable and excellent
output. Their experience is that marketing their fruit
under the stencil of the Southern California Fruit Ex
change causes it to be thought East that Porterville,
,Oroville, Palermo, Cloverdale and Lincoln are in South
ern California. They do not like to merge their individ
uality in that Way. The great experiment of co-operation
will go on more rapidly and satisfactorily if the directors
of that organization can content themselves with drop
ping the sectional adjective. Every one knows that not a
single grower south of Tehachapi would join a "Northern
California Fruit Exchange," even if it held out the pros
pect of material benefit.' The stake is so great that it
should not be imperiled by an adjective.

other was that a certain farmer down

ran his fields with negro labor and as

TTIE Czar has ordered additional cruelty and re
"pression in Finland in punishment of the assassi
nation of Bobrikoff. The act of one boy is to be
punished by inhuman treatment of a whole people. The
act itself was provoked by the Gzar's faithless violation
of a solemn treaty, followed by a system of tyranny and
oppression unknown in the modern world outside of
Holy Russia.
It was 'supposed that a brutal autocracy had exhausted
its ingenuity already in devising ways to punish and re
press the Finns. Not only was every free movement
denied them, but the Russian Government, concluding
that the despicable policy of which Bobrikoff. was the in
strument made them hate him and his master in thought
and sentiment, visited upon them additional punishment
for what they thought and did not express.
There will not long be room in the modern world for
a nation that knows only cruelty, the most reckless and
inhuman, as the means of controlling its. people. It
does not seem to be within the providence of events
that Russia shall flourish while using force and repres
sion alone as the sole protection of its vile and corrupt
government. It is murdering liberty in Finland, and
trying to assassinate civilization in Japan, but the
shadow of vengeance is following close upon the most
criminal and oppressive government that exists. A
combination of nations ; to partition Russia ar\d cut it
into pieces small enough .to be civilized and receive lib
erty would be one of the most creditable acts of this
century. '

The shoe bills of one New Yorker â a

insult the artisans employed therein.
They call it a "footgear institute," and
the proprietor goes by no less a title
than "curative orthopedist." The
wearing of these $1000 shoes is, in the
main, a hobby, and is based on nerves

sensitive nerves in their feet which

assuage the pain but shoes "prescribed"

Upon the upper Mississippi and the
Ohio people began to speak of the
South as Dixie's Land and as the years
passed they forgot why the name was
applied. The gamblers who won lus
cious rolls of the "Dixies" at poker
played with the roof removed, the vic
tims who gave up their rightful wallet
fuls of red and black currency, the
Irish deckhands and the negro roust
aboutsâall spoke of Dixie's Land.
The Civil War came on. Months
passed and Butler's army occupied the
city. Butler ordered the Citizens' Bank
to pay back all deposits to private in
dividuals in Confederate bills and or
dered that all sums due to officers or
representatives of the Confederacy
should be paid to the United States
Government in United States coin.
More than $225,000 was thus confiscated
and the bank has now pending in Con
gress a war claim for this amount.
Later General Butler made the Citi
zens' Bank the United States deposi
tory and distributing center for the
territory under hi3 charge.
After the war came new banking
laws, new customs, new ways an<i

THE Sunday Call Magazine to-morrow will publish
the second installment of Miriam Michelson's
famous novel, "In the Bishop's Carriage." This
book is almost twice as much in demand at the leading
libraries as any other one piece of fiction, and next to
Winston Churchill's "The Crossing," is the best selling
book of the day. It may be of interest to know that
Miss Michelson is a California woman, who had been
widely known here as a newspaper writer until she
turned her attention exclusively to fiction, and that her
first newspaper experience was received upon The Call.
The story will be completed in two more installments.
Aside from the novel, there arenas usual, any number
of high-class fiction features. "King For a Day" is a
full page illustrated story by W. A. Fraser, in which are
related the humorous experiences and final complications
of Lawrence Jones, captain of a tramp steamer, who for
a day rules the vast empire of Burmah in the stead of
his J twin brother, the Chief Commissioner. "Stinson's
Diplomacy," by Curran Richard Greenley, a tale of poli
tics and love, is the leading story upon the storiette
page, which contains also stories by Keith Gordon,
E. W. Sargent and S. T. Stern. "The Meows of a Kitty"
receive an illustration from Bronstrup that is quite a
classic. In 'The Yellow Mask," Jerome K. Jerome dis
cusses the so-called Yellow Peril.
The leading special article is a study of Victor H.
Metcalf by Alfred Dezendorf. The article, which is
purely concerning the man and his home and personal
life, is of especial interest in view of the fact that Mr.
Metcalf, recently appointed Secretary of Commerce and
Labor, is the second man from California ever to receive
a Cabinet position. "The Soul of Black Folk," by a
Southerner, is a sympathetic study of ' some interesting
and typical colored types.
In "Styles for Vacation Days," Augusta Prescott gives
some helpful hints to prospective visitors to the sea
shore and mountains. On the Woman's Page, Madge
Moore writes concerning embroidered stocks, the latest
feminine fad. and answers correspondents. John F.
Woolrich has a handsome full page poster of "A Drive
in the Park." The music page, as usual, is done in
three colors, and the puzzle page announces the names
of the winners on July 3 and furnishes material for an
additional week's guessing.
On July 24 there will begin in The Sunday Call Maga
zine a new series of the famous Mr. Dooley articles.
Finley Peter Dunne, the creator of Mr. Dooley, is under
an exclusive contract with McClure's, and The Call, in
the face of keenest bidding on the part of other large
newspapers on the coast, has secured the sole right to
publish these articles north of Los Angeles.

The Supervisors have taken the initiative in what they
believe to be necessary legislation to amend the char
ter. It is perhaps unnecessary to observe that the pro
posed reforms will affect neither the incompetency nor
the extravagance of the various municipal bureaus that
have made the City Hall a haven for many sons of rest.
Amendment from the supervisorial point of view does
not mean correction.
"Almost as slick an operator, only
on a smaller scale," said Harry Moffitt,
"was George Cummings, now doing a
four-year stunt in the State prison at
San Quentin. Cumming3 and his two
brothers made counterfeit dollar pieces
at Fruitvale, where they lived, and,
riding through the country on their bi
cycles, passed them upon storekeepers
and hotelmen in all the small towns
between Oakland and Stockton. When
George W. Hazen, Tommy Foster and
myself captured the men and the out
fit we found that George Cumming3
had scooped out hollow places in his
shoe heels and hidden some of the
money there. Then he had smeared
his shoes with mud so that we wouldn't
think of looking there for anything.
"Well, clever as they may be. the
smartest of them get caught. The eye
of Uncle Sam never sleeps."
United States Secret Service Agents
Harry Moffitt and Thomas B. Foster
were discussing the capture by Chief
Wilkie at St. Louis the other day of
Marcus Crahan, who had passed upon
bookmakers at the race track $30,000
worth pf counterfeit $100 gold notes.
"He was a slick worker," said
Tommy. "Every time he went out
with a wad of notes he was fortified
with an advertisement in a newspaper
announcing that he had found a sum
of money and requesting the owner to
call upon him, prove property and pay
for the ad and he could have the
money. Well, when Chief Wilkie got
upon his trail and caught him in the
act of shoving the queer with the dope
in his pocket, Crahan flashed the ad
and told Wilkie that he found the bills
in such and such ,a Â¦ place and was
waiting for the owner to come and
claim them. This would have been
a good defense if he hadn"t been
caught red-handed, and he saw it, too,
after the Chief had a quiet talk with
him. So he confessed, told the Chief
where the plates were concealed, the
Chief interceded for him and he got
only fifteen years instead of ninety
nine years, the full penalty for the
crime."

he should endeavor to have more of the same kind.
He should be detected setting a hen. or bringing home

Seven Advantages in (Â«oing Santa F<\
1. A low rate of fare: The Santa Te
round-trip to Yospmite Valley, first
class, costs only $28 50. This sav&s the
traveler $10 00.
2. No sleeping-car berth required:
Tho rail journey is made entirely in the
day time and the traveler is not put to
the expense of a Pullman b'erth. This
saves $3.00.
3. California Big Trees seen without
side ride: Santa Fe Yost-mite stages
pass directly through two groves of
giant sequoias without side ride or extra
expense. This saves $2 00.
4. Good meals at a moderate price:
Meals along the Santa Fe lino to Yoserii
ite are mo*t toothsome and cost only 50c
and 75c each. These prices are reason
able and save the traveler on the round
trip about $15 00.
5. Modern stage coaches: Santa Fe
coaches are new-built and especially for
Yosemite service. They are the newest
and most comfortable running into the
Valley.
6. The. Merced Canyon entrance to
Yosemite Valley: Santa Fe stages go up
into Yosemite Valley the way the river
comes down. This Is by far the grand
est entrance to the Valley and passes
cliffs and waterfalls seen on no other
line.
7. The "Double Loop": By an unique
routing Santa Fe passengers are taken
into the Valley one way and out another,
giving a complete change of scenery for
over fifty miles. This makes the grand
est stag'? ride in the world.

Judge Van Xostrand in denying the
motion said the question of permitting
a surgeon of a corporation to examine
one injured through any acts of the
corporation was a moot "n^mit which
had never been decided by the Su
preme Court of California. Eastern
courts had rendered various decisions,
which differed widely from each
other.
Justice of the Peace Van Nostrand
yesterday denied the motion of the
attorney of the United Railroads that
the surgeon of the company be per
mitted to make a medical examination
of Robert O'Rourke, who was injured
in an accident on one of the cars of
the corporation.
O'Rourke sued the company for
$2 99 damages, alleging that one of
his ribs was fractured and that he
sustained other injuries as a result of
the accident.

"As purty a go as I ever see," was
the answer.
"And the spectators seemed to enjoy

"The crowd was tickled to death."
"Then the fight could not have been

Judge. The case was dismissed.

"State what this defendant did," said
the Judge, pointing at a burly young
fellow who had just been placed in the

"He never did a thing to me," was
the young woman's response, after she

"What! Aren't you Belle Wilson?"
"Lands, no! Nell Gilson's my name."

The Brewers' Association asserts that
no conference had been asked for by
the union prior to taking the stand j
that unless a conference was granted
a walkout would occur at 5 o'clock last
night. Now that the association has
consented to hear the representatives
of the union and discuss the ques- 1
tions involved, a truce has been de
clared. Whether the demands of the !
union will be acceptable to the associa- j
tlon can only be determined at the con
ference to be held this afternoon.
Different branches of the brewing in
dustry are involved. The bottlers will
demand, at the conference, that their <
wages be increased $1 50 per week. The
drivers are not involved, but their
"kick" will also be considered at the
conference. Drivers want shorter hours
and some of the members of the union*
think the reauest should be granted.
Everything hinges on the conference
to be held this afternoon. Both sides
are willing to do what they deem the
right thing. Just which side will be
"right" neither party will say, as the
conference is on the line of arbitra
tion, and anticipation is not being in
dulged in.
Prior to the receipt of this official
communication the members of the
Brewers' Association had been calied
together and were discussing the issues
as given out by the union through The
Call.
The first knowledge the Brewers' As
sociation had of any attempt on the
part of the union to quit work last
evening at 5 o'clock was through yes
terday's Call. No communication was
received by the association until after
the fact was thus made known. Later,
a letter was received by Secretary Mohr
of the association from Secretary Sie
wierskl of the union, notifying the as
sociation of the action taken by the
employes' association on Thursday
night. i
The threatened strike of the brewery
workers yesterday afternoon at 5
o'clock was not called. There will be

The third payment on the purchase price
of the Dominion Copper Company's properties
In the Boundary, U. C. district is to be niude
by the Montreal arid Boston Consolidated Min
ing and Smelting Company this month. The
amount of the payments Is not known here,
but the total price Is $4R0,O0O. Local mining
men who arc Interested in the Dominion
properties and who arc otherwise Interested
in the big copper combination believe that
after thi* payment matters will move along
more rapidly and that work at the smelter
will be Ktarted Immediately. The local stock
holders of the Morrison Mining Company, who
traded in rtock of the Morrison company for
Ftock in the Montreal and Hoston Company,

The cars will be loaded by steam
shovels and hauled to Klondike River

a large scale have been started on the
Armstrong concession on the McMillan
River. Prolonged rains have caused
damage at pome places in the Yukon
district. One miner, John Lund, whose
claim is twenty-seven miles below
Bonanza, lost several thousand dollars
by the ruin of an open cut. Hydraulic
operators, of whom there are twenty
seven on Bonanza Creek, are rejoic
ing in the abundance of water.
Placer mining has nearly had its day and
the miner now needs more than a pick and
shovel to gather riches. Quartz mines are
more costly to drag the treasure frum and
many a mine that would be a money pro

and did other things that stage im
beciles usually do, but her work was
far from convincing. She deceived
only herself. Her effort evoked jeers
instead of tears. Among the spec
tators w ; ere several highly emotional
female vagrants from Pacific street,
and their derisive laughter was the
loudest. As for the seasoned court at
taches, they unanimously pronounced
the woman crazy for attempting so to
appear. They scoffed at her endeavor
until she abandoned it as a dead fail-
Th<> Kedding Free Pr^ss says that
work is going on night and day at the
Afterthought mine. An ore body has
b**en found on the mountain Flope at
a depth of about 250 feet. The work
on the smelter plant is well advanced.
Ore bins are nearing completion. The
sampling works have been erected. A
narrow gauge railway is in construc
tion.
The National mine in Shasta County
has been bonded to H. P. Walker and
C. V. \V. Radcliffe of New York. The
mine will be reopened and worked ex
tensively.
The Yreka Journal says:
The cocstruction cf the railroad to Pcott Y_l-
Uf and the building of a smelter as proposed
br Mr. Johnston will cpÂ»n up many new mines
*nd cause all the lowent grade ore of our
mountains to be worked with profit. Hr.
Johnston doÂ»Â»Â« not want any of tjje bocm busi
ness, but firmly believes this county contains
millions of gold in all the hills and gulchc-d
ruK't-ptible cf adding to the world's mineral
production with profit by use of scientific pro
eww.
Work upon the Idaho-Maryland mine
at Grass Valley has begun. The time
required to pump out the water is 'un
certain. Bray Wllkina is the manag
ing director. The first point of attack
is the repair of the pipe line, overhaul
in? the machinery and general prelim
inary work. Mr. Wilkins tells the
Grass Valley pec-ple that he expects
the water will be practically disposed
of in three or four months, as an extra
effort will be made to perform the
necessary work in the shortest possible
time. It is intended to use the present
semi-vertical shaft down to the 1000
foot level and then to continue dawn
ward as far as may be found advisable.
The work of pumping will probably
begin within thirty days.
The Trinity Journal reports that the
lower tunnel In the Yellow Rose of
Texas mine has struck a ledge eight
feet wide and of good ore at a depth
of 250 feet. This strike is likely, so
fays the Journal, to insure perma-
to the mine. A large amount of
work has been performed above the
lower level and the mine is equ'ppe.l
for working.
The Scott Valley Advance reports
that deeds have been filed for record
EQUIP5IEXT AND WORK.
The Mountain Echo reports that the
shaft at the Voinich mine, at Bear
Mountain, Calaveras County, has cut
into a vein of good ore. A depth of
500 feet for the shaft will be attained
next month. According to the Echo- a
thirty-stamp mill will be erected on the
property. Some activity is expected in
the Bear Mountain district, north and
south, along the lode, before the falling
of the rains.
A creat deal has been said in regard to the
operation of dredgers in the valleys of Califor
nia rivers, some claiming that the tailings
â¢ silt), a natural result cf their work, is filling
th" channels and slowly rendering the naviga
tion of the streams impossible. As a matter
r>t fact the dredgers are working in interior
ponds, not connected directly with the rivers.
Others complain that the tend ever which the
.irclK^r has operated is ruined for all time,
viewed from an agricultural standpoint. This
latter assertion is doubtless true, if no steps
be taken to rejuvenate the land, but it seems
an easy proposition to turn the river upon the
liinCs. which have been dredjred and the sedi
ment contained in the "waters, as a natural
t<-su;t of mountain erosion, would settle over
the barren col.bles and boulders and in a few
year? the valley would again become a pro
lific agricultural tract.
cf the people of Shasta County to see dredging
for (rol-i become an important mining industry
of this reg:cn in the near future.
The Mining and Scientific Press says
about the dredgers for gold:
!nw Igo and another dredger working satisfac
torily in the river channel above Redding, n<-ar
Middle Creek, and with several drillers pros
1-evtir.p auriferous gravr-1 along Cottonwood
CrÂ«-rk and in the immediate vicinity of Red

The most striking feature of mining
in California continues to be the ex
pansion of the limits in which the
search for gold by the dredger process
is used. A drill has arrived at Red
ding for the purpose of prospecting
ground in the limits of the city of Red
ding, on the river front, east of the
residential section. A drill is in opera
tion across the river from Redding and
just north of the city. The Detroit

The grocers of San Francisco are

which has over 500 members. The
wholesale trade has already contrib
uted numerous articles to be used as
prizes at their outing and practically
all the groceries of the city will be
closed when the great day arrives.
"Grocers' day," which for thirty
three years has been celebrated ' in
May, will this year be celebrated
Wednesday, August 10. The grocers
of San Francisco were devoting their
energies to entertaining the National
Grocers' Association and in holding a
pure food, "show at the time usually
deyoted to their annual celebration,
which was the cause of its postpone
ment. The interest engendered by
their successful exposition at Mechan

thusiasm among the retail grocers and
as a consequence even greater interest
than usual is. being taken in their out

Charlie Hall, the lad from Ventura,
came to Parke Wilson unheralded and
practically unknown, but now he can
get a job on any man's ball team. He
stands second in games won at the
present time and were it not for him
Seattle would never have the honor of
being second In the chase after the
flag.
And then comes Charlie Baura of
Los Angeles, another youngster who
has been overlooked for a long time.
Baum suffered more hard luck than
any other slab artist In this or any
other league, but even at that, he suc
ceeded in getting away with a goodly
percent of his games. Baum has them
all beat in throwing curved balls and
is possessed of one of the prettiest de
liveries in the league.
Dick Williams has not been right this
season. He never seemed to strike his
gait and has failed utterly to show
his worth. His best work was done
at the opening of the season, but since
that time he has apparently lost his
speed and cunning.
Bobby Keefe, the Santa Clara lad,
Is another wiz who has set the fans
talking about him. Though slight of
build and meek of manner the young
ster possesses' a wonderful faculty for
fooling batsmen and barring a little
wildness at times his work this sea
son has been well nigh perfect.
Jimmy Buchanan, the huge Texan
on Peter Lohman's staff, is voted by
a vast army of fans the best pitcher
in this league. He is certainly the
steadiest and the coolest. It Is his
magnificent work that has kept the
Commuters from sliding to the bottom.
His record of twelve straight victories
bids . fair to stand for the balance of
the season. This is Buchanan's second
year in professional company and he
should make the big league next sea
son.
The baseball season of 1904 on the
Pacific Coast has been remarkable for
the number oÂ£ young pitchers who
have been tried out and found to be
there with everything that goes to be
wilder the best batsmen In these parts.
In fact, the youngsters made even bet
ter records than the seasoned slab ar
tists who have twirled in many climes
and against the best stickers the game
has ever produced.
Among the youngsters who are shin
ing brightly at the present time is Or
val Overall, the giant from Berkeley,
who * has done much to elevate the
standing of Tacoma. "Ovle" did not
make a brilliant start, but when he got
into the going he showed 'em all that
'he had the goods and was one of those
slabsters who is always willing to de
liver them.
An effort Is being made to postpone
the regatta, which, according . to the
bylaws, must be held on the second
Sunday in August. Lawrence Adams,
the club measurer, says it will be itn
possible for him to measure all of the
models in time to race them on the
second Sunday in August. All boats
must be measured three weeks before
the race.
The club at present is experiencing
considerable difficulty in framing a set
of rules to govern racing that will be
satisfactory to all. The rules as set
forth in tho bylaws have not proved
entirely satisfactory. W. B. Collier's
new set of rules will be tried for three
Sundays and if they meet with the ap
proval of the boat owners they will no
doubt be adopted. Under the club
rules the boats finishing first and sec
ond in a heat qualify for the semi
finals. Collier's idea is to allow a boat
to race until it has been defeated three
times, when it shall be dropped from
competition. In this way the boats will
narrow down to two in the finals. One
of these must defeat the other three
times before it is declared winner.
The chief objection to Collier's meth
od is that it willjae impossible to finish
a race in a day. Many claim that with
twenty or more boats entered it would
be out of the question to dispose of
them all in a single day. To test this
the club members have been requested
to bring as many yachts as possible
to the lake on the next three Sundays.
If the rules stand the test and the
races are completed in a day they
should be adopted, as they lessen the
element of luck and the winner gets
the pennant strictly on merit. Tho
new rules affect only Sunday pennant
races.
The only thing needed by the owners
of the miniatures is a clubhouse near
Spreckels Lake. Some of the boats are
kept in a shed several blocks from the
lake, but this does not give the satis
faction a clubhouse on the banks of
the lake would. Those who carry their
boats to the lake each Sunday arc able
to enter but one b:>at and considerable
difficulty is experienced in getting the
boats to the lake owing to the crowded
condition of the street cars. The club's
subscription list is growing and before
another year has passed the new club
house will be a reality.
Model yachting is a pastime that is
becoming very popular and attracts
many spectators on Sunday after
noons. In fact, the crowd of onlookers
of late has been so large that they
have crowded the path reserved for the
sailors and made it difficult at times
for the latter to conduct the races.
The yacht owners, however, are* not
meeting with the difficulties on the new
lake that they did on Stow Lake. The
races are much more satisfactory and
the time faster.

James Sweeney has a likely Futurity
candidate in Rocked Asleep by Rocker-

A TRIO OF YOUNG GREYHOUNDS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE A BOLD BID FOR THE HIGHEST HONORS IN THIS I
YEAR'S COURSING FUTURITY. A LARGE NUMBER OF PUPPIES ARE ELIGIBLE, AND OUT OF THE COLLECTION A
NEW CHAMPION WILL PROBABLY BE DEVELOPED. j
Two tournaments will be held in the
local courts to-morrow. On the Cali
fornia Club courts there will be a hand
icap doubles tournament for the di
rectors* cups. The trophies are In the
possession of Herbert Schmidt and
Harry Rolfe. This team has won them
twice. Schmidt is in Canada, and Rolfe
will play with Sf^ney Salisbury. The
cups have been won once by Will Al
len and Dr. Hill, Grant and Chester
Smith and Allen and Tracy Crawford.
The last named are the only ones of
the three now playing together.
Parmeley Paret, a well-known player
from the East, has written a relative
in Alameda that he will come to the
coast and participate In the Septem
ber tournaments. Paret at one time
ranked in the first ten and was runner
up at Newport, but the game has gone
ahead of him since then and the local
men are figured to beat him.
Reuben Hunt, former champion of
Alameda County, will also enter the
coast championship tournaments. Hunt
has made quite a name for himself In
the East and stands a good chance of
winning the tourney.
The presence of the Eastern experts
would be a great benefit to the local
players and would help tennis very
much. The latter learn nothing from
playing with one another year after
year, and the game here Is at a stand
still. â¢
It would be an easy matter to bring
two of the best players in the country
to the coast, as several of them have
expressed a desire to participate In the
September tournaments at San Rafael.
It is the intention of the committee
making the arrangements to hold an
exhibition match in a week or two to
raise funds for this purpose.
Tha tournaments are only six weeks
off, and the question should be settled
at once. The Hardy brothers would
probably decide to enter the tourna
ments. It would take over a month
to put them in shape, and If the local
players are desirous of making any
kind of a showing they should see that
these clever brothers compete.
The players who are expected to come
to the coast are Beals C. Wright, Hol
comb Ward or W. J. Clothier. Wright
will be one of the players, but whether
his partner will be Clothier or Ward
has not been decided. Ward ranks sec
ond in the United States this year. The
only man placed above him Is Cham
pion Lamed. Clothier ranks third and
Wright fourth. Against these cracks
the only local men with a chance to
win are the Hardy brothers. Bell. Mur
dock and MacGavin might make a good
showing, but it is doubtful. Sam
Hardy is not in very good shape, but
Sumner, with a month's practice, would
have nothing to fear from any of the
visitors. In 1899 he beat both Wright
and Ward at Del Monte. The latter
have improved since then, while Hardy
has not played In a tournament for
three years. The same year. In doubles,
the two best teams In the East were
beaten by the Hardy brothers.
The question as to whether or not
some of the Eastern cracks will visit
the coast in September and compete in
the championship tennis tournaments
is the one that interests followers of
the game most at present. Each year
at about this time the same rumors are
in circulation, and the enthusiasts
have become skeptical. Those who are
making arrangements for the enter
tainment of the Eastern champions
claim that there is no doubt about
their coming. The local tennis men
are anxious to try conclusions with
the Easterners, but will not believe
they are coming until they see them
here.
Though a fair steady breeze blew
Saturday afternoon for the race for the
Perpetual Challange cup, the general
opinion among yachtsmen is that the
trial was Inconclusive. The Corinth
ians think that the Corinthian would
have done better in a stronger breeze
and the San Francisco yachtsmen* are
decidedly of the opinion that a heavy
wind would have brought the Chal
lenger home a winner. All agree that
the Challenger Is a remarkably fast and
able boat. She will certainly be the
San Francisco club's representative in
next year's race for the Perpetual
Challenge cup. It is not so certain,
however, that the Corinthian will be
the defender of the trophy. When it is
considered that the Corinthian is four
teen feet longer over all than the Chal
lenger and carried nearly 200 square
feet more canvas, she ought to beat
the Challenger by a more decisive mar
gin than forty-one seconds. Even un
der the conditions of last Saturday's
race, one well-known racing yachts
man said that the Challenger might
have won if she had crossed the start
ing line first and luffed the Corinth
ian out to windward on the reach to
the leeward stakeboat. Â«
There are some yachtsmen who say
that more speed could have, been got
out of the Challenger if her light sails
had been handled more smartly.
The regatta committee of the Cali
fornia Yacht Club, acting under article
25 of the by-laws of the Pacific Inter
club Yacht Association, which
the club races, has ruled that the elev
enth annual class flag regatta and
Owners' Cup race, sailed on Sunday,
June 19, be resailed over â¢ the same
course on Sunday, August 28. The en
trance fees paid for the race on June
19 will be returned.
The Corinthian fleet has a cruise to
Paradise Cove on hand for to-night,
returning to-morrow. Next Sunday
the Corinthian Yacht Club will hold its
annual handicap race in cruising rig
under the management of the regatta
committee, T. J. Kavanaugh, James K.
Bulger and Douglas Erskine. It will
be non-owners' day at the clubhouse.
The annual race for the Wallace
trophy having been held last Sunday,
to-day and to-morrow are open dates
on the programme of the California
Yacht Club. On Saturday, July 23. sev
eral of the Oakland Creek yachts, will
start on a week's cruise up the Sacra
mento River.
The annual regatta of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club will be held to-morrow
over a course starting and finishing off
the clubhouse at Sausalito. The start
will be at 11 a. m., the course being
across a line 'near the club wharf to
and around Goat Island shoal buoy,
leaving the mark on the starboard
hand; thence to and round Presidio
shoal buoy, leaving the mark on the
starboard hand; thence to the finish
across the starting line. The race will
be governed by arbitrary handicaps ar
ranged by the regatta committee, which
will advise boat owners of the time
allowances before the start. The re
gatta committee consists of R. S.

The Grand Circuit, which opens at
Detroit one week from Monday next,
Elves every promise of furnishing the
greatest harness racing seen in years,
and the California trotters and pacers
will get their share of the money.
Whether /or not Lou Dillon will reduce
her record of 1:58%, made at Memphis
last year, is a question much debated.
The enthusiasts Eay Bhe will, but cool
headed, practical horsemen know that
the task is a tremendous one for any
horse. As she is to go without the
wind shield, and with no runner in
imnt. the much-disputed question as to
i be aid of these contrivances rn break
iufr records will be settled.
Much interest is felt in harness cir
cles over the, showing that will be
made by the trotter. Golden Gate, by
Hay Bird, that is entered throughout
the California circuit. He has trotted
a mile in 2:13Â»i already and many think
2:10 will not stop him. but there are
others who claim they will beat him
v.ith horses that cannot step a mile
letter than 2:15.
Great preparations are being made
lor the oi>ening of the California cir
cuit of harness racing at Pleasanton on
"Wednesday, July 27. A new departure
is the decision of nearly every associa
tion giving a harness meeting in Cali
fornia this year to have no bookmaking
<n the events, but to confine the specu
lation to the old style auction and the
I art mutuel pools. It is also very likely
that an Australian totalizator will be
used at several of the meetings â this
machine being simply a pari mutuel
box made large enough so that every
horse can be played separately.
As the date of opening the trotting
F<-ason draws near, many new horses
are being uncovered and there will
doubtless be many surprises for the
"talent" which is usually given : -. credit
Â¦ >Â¦..'" . Â¦ ,. Â¦ â¢ _
for the Â¦wisdom necessary to pick the
vlnner in a majority of the events.
"Walter Wilkes. a 7-year-old gelding by
Sable Wilkes. owned by V. J. Guinasso
of this city, now being trained by Jack
Groom, is the latest phenom. There
are rumors of Walter Wilkes. having
trotted a quarter in 30>4 seconds at San
Jcse last week. As he is wholly un
tried, horsemen generally will not pin
their faith to him until he has been
i-tcn in at least one actual contest. It
takes fast miles instead of fast
Quarters to make a favorite these days.
Al McDonald has a* trotter at Pleas
anton called Charlie T. by Zombro,
2:11; that is talked of among the horse
men at that track as one of the money
winners in the big stakes for slow
classes this season. He has beat 2:15
in his work, which is a high rate of
speed for this lime of the year. ,'â¢#-,
The popular club man and millionaire
of Los Angeles, Charles A. Winship.
Is very likelv to surprise the talent on
the circuit with a trotter called Abe
Miller by Titus that has been little
heard of ur> to this time. Titus is a
full brother to that great little pacer,
Direct. 2:0i'.i. and his sole representa
tive in the list of standard performers
is the pacer. Stlpulator, that took a
record of 2:11)4 l*Â»t season on one of
the Eastern tracks, but in this trot-
Ting son, Abe Miller, he has a repre
sentative that will make him lasting
fame If no accidents occur. A record
I -clow 2:10 is freely predicted for him
by the southern horsemen.
Up to last Sunday Harold B. Rich
ardson's batting average stood at the
extraordinarily high figure of 357 runs, \
he having been at the bat five times, i
having served S5T runs and lost his â¢
wicket only once. Last Sunday he
raised his total to 416, but, as he lost
j his wicket, he has played two com
pleted innings, his average being 208
runs per inning. Roberts stood at the
head of the bowling list, E. H. Wilkes
of the Pacific Club taking second place,
though this is the first time that his
name has appeared in the list of bowl
ing averages at all. He did not begin
to play in the early part of the season,
but will probably play regularly for
the future. The batting and bowling
averages up to but not inclusive of last

HARLEM SELECTIONS.
The introduction of rubber-cored
balls has rendered considerable ex
penditure necessary on many British
golf courses. Holes to reach which
approach shots with iron clubs were
once required can now be reached
from the tee by long drivers and in
many cases it has been thought best
to lay out" such holes afresh. The Ab
erdeen Golf Club has added about
COO yards to its course. When the
extensive alterations contemplated are
complete the total length of the course
will be about three and a half miles.
The Olympic golf tournament will
take place in St. Louis during the
week beginning Monday,- September
19". Entries close on September 12
and should be forwarded, with the
entrance fee of $5, to F. W. Gerould.
World's Fair Grounds, St. Louis.
There will be a qualifying competition
over thirty-six holes, medal play, the
thirty-two contestants who return the
lowest scores being eligible for the
match play rounds. The winner will
receive a gold medal, a silver cup and
the title of Olympic golf, champion.
Many other prizes are offered and
there will be a consolation event for
those who fail to qualify in the stroke
competition and for the sixteen who
lose their matches in the first round
of the match play.
In the Scotch foursomes for men
held last Saturday over eighteen holes,
medal play, on the links of the San
Itafael Golf Club A. S. Lilly and W. J.
Casey tied with R. B. Hellman and
F. H. Beaver,, the net score of both

played off to-day and the winners will
receive a pair of handsome silver
cups, presented by C. A. Belden.

of four years during the incumbency

On the Presidio athletic grounds to
morrow a return match of football
under the Gaelic rules will be played
between the Parnell team and the rep
resentatives of the Occidental Club.
The Parnells are the Gaelic champions
of the Pacific Coast and the Occidental
team includes many of the best play
ers picked from the clubs of the Cali
fornia Association Football League.
In the first match, which was played
with great spirit between these two
teams, the Parnells won by a score of
3 to 2. The association players were
at a disadvantage on that occasion
through their lack of practice in the
Gaelic game, which permits handling
of the ball â a thing strictly prohibited
by the rules of association football.
The Occidental team has been
strengthened considerably and has
been coached in the Gaelic game by
D. J. McCarthy. The match will be
played with the sanction of the Cali
fornia Association Football League,
the Gaelic Athletic Association and the
Pacific Association of the Amateur
Athletic Union. The teams will line
up in the following positions:

Taking the third game from Oakland
was like smoking a pill of good hop for
San Francisco yesterday. All the home
team needed was one good inning. Thai
one happened to be the first. Then
four tallies were hammered In while
the Oakland fielders looked on in
amazement and wondered how it would
feel to make all those runs in a bunch.
Score. San Francisco 6, Oakland 1.
It so happened that Oakland landed
thrice on Mr. Whalen in the initial
t-pasm. But after that time, Mr. Â¦Whal
en was cautious ar.d Btingy to a de
gree about disposing of his base hits
tnd passes. Oakland got but one man
t" fir^t base subsequently. Byrnes was
the one to turn the trkk. hitting to left
field in the eighth.
After Oakland had scored in the first
nrand, many thought that Whalen
v.ou!d surely com',* in for a walloping.
They nr>Klectrd however to dope up thf
hitting abilities <>f the home team.
It Â«o happened that Mr. Graham had
r.-'thinp on his !i;=t that th-? locals could
! i cet jerry to in their hour of need.
J'."Â«:dcs. he was wild and no earthly
good wh^n men v. ere on bases.
Hildebrand swung safely to right
-flfld in the first for San Francisco.
Meany made the second out, but Ir
win was hit by a pitched ball and
T'r.\ nsend walked, making a full house.
:>:::.â¢ r als<> partook of the generosity of
Mr. Graham, forcing Hildebrand in
with a run.
The bases were yet loaded to their
Utmost capacity when Andy Anderson
uooden Fhocd up to the plate with a
* !ub in his hand. The first one looked
pood to him and he soused it. Out to
center field went the ball and Irwin
and To\ras?nd tore to the plate.
Kfujrer then recovered the sphere an<I
threw it wide to the plate This littlÂ«
n.ishaji lÂ»_>t Miller arrive and simply
bn Ice the game up.
Oakland was in after the first inning.
Every man on the team quit and
played about as rotten baseball as he
v hs capable of. The s--tars from Oak
land could not hit. nor could they field.
The wonder of it all is that Pan Fran
<i-'.> did not cop a few more runs. In
t. early every inning they got men on
tbe baps, but only two of th?m sneaked
in after the avalanche of runs in -he
Cist round.
Fj'a Francisco field* d like gleaners.
N< thins? that looked like an error hap
pened whiie the local fielders were giv
.'r:;; chase to the ball. Devereaux maae
a nice unassisted double play in the
Eirth when he robbed Miller of a good
drfvÂ« by getting the ball with one mitt.

STANDING' OF THE CLUBS.
Nelson, without a moment's hesita
tion, plunged into the stream and
swam to the child's assistance. After
a hard struggle he managed to get
the little one to the float, where Ted
Murphy assisted them to dry land.
Nelson was wildly cheered by bystand
ers and pronounced a hero. The little
girl was none the worse for the duck
ing, but had not Nelson gone to her
rescue she would ; probably have
drowned.
After the hard work. Nelson and
Murphy went to Escalle baths for a
swim and Nelson proved himself quite'
a hero. He wa3 Just about to return to
camp when he heard a splash and
somebody cried: "A little girl has just
fallen in the water."
Head Trainer Frank McDonald took
charge of affairs at Eddie Hanlons
quarters at Croll's Gardens, Alameda,
yesterday and his* first edict was that
the little fighter whom he is to prepare
to meet Battling Nelson is not to be
so strenuous In his exercising. Mc-
Donald was' prevented from going into
camp at the outset with Hanlon by
reason of illness In hia family, and
when he arrived in Alameda yesterday
he decided that Eddie had been setting
too fast a clip in his preliminary work
and ordered a change of pace. Hanlon
and laziness have never been intro
duced and are in nowise acquainted.
He is of that class of boxers that al
ways wants to be up and doing. To
prevent the possibility of Eddie over
doing things in his zeal to fit himself
for what he expects will be a trying
contest. Trainer McDonald has taken
a determined stand. He asserts that
his charge will not be permitted to don
the mitts again until his nose, which
was sunburned and then peeled through
colliding with gloves, shall have en
tirely healed. That will not be before
the middle of next week. In the mean
time Eddie will confine himself to road
running, bag punching, shadow sparr
ing, rope jumping and wrestling.
Trainer McDonald supervised the
training of Battling Nelson when that
fighter was getting into condition for
his mill with Martin- Canole. The
knowledge lhat he, then derived of the
Scandinavian's style and temper he
will impart to Hanlon. McDonald be
lieves that Eddie has a splendid chance
to "win from Nelson, stating that w iiile
the latter is taller than- the local lad
he is not more rugged. Hanlon's
trainer says he does not think Nelson
should meet with any difficulty in
making 130 pounds.
Battling Nelson was at it. hammer
and tongs, again to-day. He took a
ten-mile spin on the road and returned
breathing easily. This afternoon he
boxed four hot rounds with Frank
Neuhousg and Ted Murphy had to stop
the bout to save Frank from punish
ment.
DENVER. July 15.â The Grand West
ern handicap, the second most import
ant trai> shooting event of this coun
try, was won to-day by Charles Plank
of Denver. Plank, George Maxwell, the
one-armed marksman, and Henry An
derson, of Salina, -Kans., tied scores
with 9^ out of a possible 100. In the
first shoot-off at twenty targets each
scored 19. Then Plank and Anderson
broke 20 straight. Maxwell dropping; out
of the race with 17 kills. The third
shoot-off resulted: Rlank, 19; Ander
son, 18, which gave victory to the Den
\er man. In winning the tournament
Plank also becomes possessed of the
challenge cup.
This curÂ» will be contested for again
| at North Platte. Neb., next week. Hen
ry Anderson was the winner of the
pOoyd Park cup, an event of fifty tar-
Kets, he havins: scored 49. Plank and
McGee, with scores of 49 out of 50, won
the Lafevre guns. The following is

BRIGHTON BEACH, N. Y., July 15.
In three races to-day the winners
were heavily backed and an estimate
of the bookmakers' losses was at least
$100,000. One of the "killings" of the
year was made on Hatchet in the first
race and David Gideon and Jesse L#e\vi
sohn won between them $30,000 on this
former inmate of Gideon's stables.
Opening; at six to one, the colt went
back to eight to one, but in the last
few moments" it was literally backed
off the boards, so that at the finish
two to one was the average quotation.
The Tide made the running and for
-nearly a mile it seemed that he had
a winning chance, but in the mean
time Hatchet was always in a good po
sition an 1 in the last furlong came on
and won from Prince Salm Salm, rid
den by C. Kelly. Tide was third 'and
Dan Connors, Hildebrand's mount, was
fourth. Â¦ > '.':
In the second race something- resem
bling a "killing" was made. The me- 1
dium this time-was the l.andsome. filly
Dinah Shad, which was at 20 to 1
at one stage of the betting and
went to the post at eight -to . one.
Dinah Shad won . with Misr-ing Link
second. Duchess Ollie, the favorite,
was jammed into the rails on the' far
turn in an effort of Jockey Hildobrand
to send her through an opening whioh
was not large enough. As a result of
this interference the near hip- of the
filly was blec-ding and her trainer, R.
E. Campbill, asked . the stewards to
take some means to protect his horses
fwm such accidents. The stewards
questioned several of the riders but no
change was made in the order of the
finish. Several others â¢ in ; this race
were interfered with. Summary: "

Incidentally he ran the fastest six fur
longs of the year on the local tracks,
his time of 1:12 3-5 being "hung out.
Buiieigh was a prohibitive favorite at
2 to 5 at post time,' backed from 7 to
10 and heavily played by his owner,
who fairly Hooded the ring with bills
of large denomination. Van Ness, des
pite his ten victories this season, was
at 10 to 1 to win and 9 to 5 for the
place, where he finished after a bad
ride. Princess Tulane, backed from 12

John \V. Schorr ' unbottled' a good
thing in the first race, for maiden 2
year-olds in his Top Gallant-Bonnie
Bird .colt, Jack Lory. 'Patsy also
profited through victory,- as it was his
money chiefly that backed !the colt
down from c to 4 to 1 at post time,
making him a close second, choice to
Mum, which was always favorite
around 3 to 1, but she got nothing, j
But two favorites won during the af
ternoon, the bookies recouping for their
losses of yesterday. The track was
lightning fast, weather clear and warm

It Is frequently the case that a party wishes
to sell his holdings for the purpose of reinvest-
ing the proceeds in a different kind of property.
Our long experience in this business enables
us to often accomplish this double purpose by
only one transaction. The only condition re
make is that your property, if you wish us to
â¢ dispose of It for you, MUST BE GOOD OF ITS
KIND AND IN A GOOD LOCATION. Dcn't
take up either our time or your own with
worthless offerings, or property so heavily
mortgaged as to leave no actual equity.
If it has merit, whether ycu own real estate
or a mercantile or manufacturing business,
bring a description of same to our office, stat-
ing what kind of property you prefer in ex-
change, and you will be surprised how quickly
we can effect the result.
THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE UNDER-
STAND THE EXCHANGE BUSINESS and are
the only company in San Francisco making a
specialty of same. We make no charge for ad-
vertising or any other purpoae unless we pro-
cure an exchange satisfactory to you to ac-
cept.

13V A TITTINQ ADVIzPTISCMENT IN THE CALL i!S!iWhat the bartender said cannot, of
course, be repeated. Down In the
mixture of froth, hops and malt he
plunged a big and not too clean hand
and pawed around the bottom of the
kettle. The money consisted of a
nickel and five pennies, and the bar
tender was obliged to dive three times
before he got all the coins. Mean
while he almost exhausted his vocab
ulary of swear words. "When he had
finally secured all the sunken treasure
he almost threw the can at the boy, x
who grabbed it and ran like a scared
deer. â New York Press.
Tha law against selling beer to
minors was clearly violated In this
case. . So were ueveral other laws,
moral as well as legal, before the sale
of a pint was consummated. The lit
tle chap entered the side door of the
saloon and, handing the bartender a
pail, lisped out, "Me father wants a
pint o' beer."
The big bartender took the can and,
while still talking to a customer, held
it under the tap and handed the re
ceptacle to the boy. who started for
the door.
"Here, where's the money?" yelled
the drawer of beer.
"It was in the can," stammered the
boy. '*

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
According to modern ideas, the hu
man body may also supply its want of
iron from vegetable foods and it is ex
pected that by increasing the quantity
of iron in certain vegetables it will be
possible tp procure a natural means of
supplying the human system with a
nutriment rich in iron and easily as
similated. The first experiment was
made with spinach by adding hydrate
of iron to the soil. The spinach grown
from seed showed a percentage of iron
seven times as great as ordinary spin
ach, without injury to the plant. This
is considered a very favorable result,
as the iron contents are perfectly suffi
cient for medicinal purposes and In a
form which possesses none of the de
fects of the best artificial iron prepar
ations. It is presumed that other fer
ruginous plants rich In iron will yield
similar results, so that not only .the
science of medicine will be benefited,
but the gardeners will also find their
cultivation a source of profit. â New
York Commercial.
Richard Guenther, .United States
Consul General at Frankfort, quotes
the Neue Tngeblatt of in re
ports as to interesting experiments that
are being conducted at the agricultural
bacteriological station of Vienna. It Is
a well-known fact that salts of iron
are of great importance for the hu
man system. The artificially prepared
foods containing iron which are intro
duced into the human body have not
always the desired effect, because the
quantities of iron contained therein,
even if considerable, are not completely
assimilated.

of Mrs. Sophie Lurhmann, deceased,
filed a contest in the Probate Court
against Mrs. Lurhmann's will. They
allege that she did not sign the docu
ment nor was it attested by competent

good. Judge Troutt appointed Fred

Trade In the fruit market continued active
; for local account and a good demand was noted
: for shipment to Honolulu on the steamer Ala
Â¦ meda. out to-day. The market was heavily
I supplied with nearly all descriptions, however.
â¢ and. despite the extra demand for export.
; prices of several kinds ranged lower. The best
! Gravensteln Apples were weaker, with $1 50
t per box an extreme figure, and Plums and
â¢' Prunes were abundant and easier, even for the
; fanciest stock. Fine Bartlett Pears In open
i boxes were firm at 2c per pound, but the mar
' ket was heavily supplied with culls and wind
falls, .for which no reasonable offer was re
fused. ' Advlce3 were received from the river
; districts saying that the recent high winds
: caused a heavy drop In Pears, and It is ex
1 pected that this market will soon be overloaded
Â¦"Â¦with them. Peaches w*fe still a glut on the

WHEAT â The foreign markets were easy and
.quiet. Broomhall. under date of June 21. es
timates the World's wheat crop for 1904-5 at
2.900.000.000 bushels, against 2,923.000,000 in
10OT-4, and 2,012,800.000 In 1902-3.
Chicago showed no material change on the
day. The Southwest bought freely.
The private wires of Mitchell. Mulcahy &
Co. said: "Market was again an uncertain,
hesitating affair. Crop news is almost wholly
bullish so far as It relates to the winter wheat
crop, only differing In degrees. The market
lias been evened, up a good deal, however. In
the past few days and the ehort interest Is
very much reduced. AVhlle there Is some rein
stating of wheat sold out yesterday, yet the
buying is not In any great volume.. Traders
are rather Inclined to await the effect of fine
weather, which does not now seem improba
ble. I The cash wheat and the July wheat must
also adjust themselves and there ts an ele
ment of great uncertainty aa to how this will
be brought about. Snow's report, estimating
deficiency of 100.000.000 as compared with last
year. Is probably the most sensational thing.
The Mcdern Miller concedes great damage, but
is not so high In its estimate as some other
authorities. There Is also more talk of dam
age to quality than to quantity. We still feel
that September and December wheat should
be bought on fair reactions, but are not quite
certain that we will not get a little further
reaction if the weather keeps favorable."
Wheat in this market ruled firm, with actlvt
' trading In the ring on the morning seaMon. The
situation ia the cash grain remained ua-

I out their | knives' and are going to slash the

I 19c per lb. Whether they will succeed or not
I remains to he seen. They will meet with con
' siderable opposition from those houses who

CHICAGO. July 15. â The wheat market
opened easier to-day, with September eff a
shade to 1 ,i1j%c. The initial weakness was a
result of the heavy liquidation in September.
With the exception of Kansas, more favorable
weather conditions were noted In both the
spring and winter wheat country. This im
provement was largely responsible for the sell
ing pressure. Foreign statistics, however,
contributed somewhat to the bearish tendency.
Liverpool cables beinc lower and shipments
from Argentina larger than expected. The
liberal olierinfcs were met by an excellent ile
mand and the market souii became quite
strong. September advancing to 87 Uc An
official forecast of additional rains In the
Southwest was a big factor in the upturn.
There was no cessation to the arrival ot Dull
ish news from that section of thi country.
There also were some reports from the North
weft of the same tenor. A St. Louis trade
Journal was bullish on the yield of the wheat
crop, but bearish on the quality. Durlnsr the
last part of the session the market again turned
weak, largely In sympathy with a severe
break in July. Final figures on September
were at SO^kfiSic. July sold between D5c and
M*ic. clorinE at the low point with a loss of
lKc.
The corn market had a somewhat easier
ton*- at the openins. The clo?e was near the
highest point of the day. fr??ptember opened
}&Otta to -TgC lower at 43Va'&4S?ie and closed
at 4U&C.
In view of the firmness !n other grains,
together with small stocks and light receipts,
oat? were in fair demand at a slight advance.
September closed at â¢"2%c, the top.
The provision 1 market received no support
from influential Quarters and was for the most
part permitted to urift. irnder the influence
of lower trices ' for hoes, th? tendency was
downward At the close September pork was
off 5c; lard was down S'.ic and ribs closed
with a loss of 2'.4c.

NEW YORK. July 15.â The decision of
JudÂ£e Bradford, handed down at Trenton to- j
Oay in the Northern Securities case, proved of
expioaiva effect on the stocks of L'ruon Pacific,
Southern 1'aciflc and Northern Securities, in
of the larse preliminary speculation
which fcas been going O a in thjse stocks most
of the week in anticipation of this decision.
The violent effect of the decision is the more
noteworthy as us general tenor as well was
pretty accurately foretold. In the general
market the elTect was more In accordance with
normal exi>ect*tion, the speculation coming to
a pause alter an anticipated movement to take
profits. Southern Pacific and Union Pacific
also, after a spasmodic Jump on the first an
nouncement of the decision, wavered under a
flood of l-rofit-takinj cHerings. But the two
Mocks then rtsamed an aggreESlve upward
movenyetu and galvanized the general market
Into some activity again. Thr effect was to
enable the general market to hold some of Its
earlier gains, but no imixjrtant new points of
*Tr<?ngth were developed after the Securities de
cision bemme known. As a matter of Tact,
the information regarding the decision on
which the bulk of trading was done In the
siock market, was of a very meajrer .character,
consisting of little more than the flash bul
letins announcing in general terms that the.
decision was iu favor of the Harriman party.
According to precedent views of different
phases of this litigation the effect mijht be ex
pected to discourage speculation. Without any
determination of the vital points at Issue in
the contentions, the result Is to leave the
whole controversy still open, while the finan
cial paralysis of the corporation, both as to re
ceiving dividends from the constituent com
panies and distributing to their own stock
holders, 's assured of a prolongation only to
be terminated by the definite settlement of the
quarrÂ»l. So far as may be detected, the con
tinuation of the litigation through various
phases ot arpeal and delay promises to be
quiTÂ» Indefinite: a prospect that has caused
trerarra In Wall street when offered to Its
consideration at times shortly passed. The
market during the morning was of much the
yame character np fcr the days past, although
the expectation of the Northern Securities de
clficn tvm an influence even then. Some of
the recent rtronc stocks were under pressure
of profit-taking-. Trhlle others made fresh ad- Â¦
vance?. Preliminary estimates of the weekly
currency movement promised another enor
mous accumulation of cash In the banks. Â«=ub
treasury operations, receipts of ne-x and Jap
anese sold ar.d the regular movement of cur
rency on balance with the interior all contrib
uting liberal proportions In a promised pain
of over ?10. OOO.OOO. An advance In the price
of copper did not save Amalgamated Copper
from realization. Union Pacific's rise to 9"'Â«c
and Southern Pacific's to 52 were not fully
held, and the irrerular tone of the market in
the fini;! hour continued up to the close.
Pressure on the Burlington joint 4Â« and the
Orecon Short Line participating 4s made the
otherwise firm bond market irregular. Total
sale*. i<ar value. M.S45.OOO.
United State* br>nd* were unchanged on cafl.

A plot to murder Fong Ling, one of
the presidents of the See Yup Society,
who turned State's evidence in the
murder case of Tom Yick. a member
of the Chinese Educational Society,
who was foully slain a year ago last
May, came to light last night when
Ab Sow, wife of Fons Ling, was ar
rested for attempting to poison her
husband. Fong Ling has long been a
marked man for the highbinders of
the See Yup Society on account of his
giving damaging evidence for the pros
ecution in the murder trials of Quan
Quock Wah and Ngun Lun, two presi
dents of tongs in the See Yup Society,
who were concerned in the conspiracy
that resulted in the murder of Tom
Yick.
GIVES HUSBAXD SOUP.
Last Tuesday Ah Sow, Ling's wife,
went to the Chinese Educational So
ciety with a bc/wl of turnip soup, which
she presented to her husband, who had
been residing at the society's head
quarters at "09% Commercial street for
protection. With an inquiry as to his
health from an apparently loving wife,
she bade him drink the beverage. "You
look sick and I made you this soup to
do you good," she said. .
Ling had not seen much of his wife
since he left his home to live at the
educational society's place and her re
gard for his welfare struck him pecu
liarly. With him in the room at the
time were Lee Sut and Lew Ylng.
Knowing that the See Yups had threat
ened his life. Ling became suspicious
of the soup and asked his wife to first
partake of some. She hesitated, then
took a mouthful and, when she thought
that she was not observed, spat It upon
the floor. Her actions did not escape
the notice of Ling's friends, who were
watching her furtively. They imme
diately told Ling not to drink the liquid
and grabbed the bowl containing the
questionable nourishment.
Ah Sow tried to appear . unconcerned
and soon after left the house. The
Kate Kay yesterday brought suit in
the Justices' Court against Michael
Driscoll to recover $299. The com
plaint in the case alleges that on May
17. 1903, Driscoll in writing engaged
the plaintiff, who is his sister and a
resident of Yorkshire, England, at the
time, to act as his housekeeper, and
promised if she would abandon her
home in England he would reason
ably compensate her for her services.
She was engaged at the agreed wage
of $20 monthly, but on March 3, 1904,
the defendant abruptly terminated
Fuch service, departed from the city
and left her without means for her
support and that of her minor chil
dren.

The murder case of Tom Yick, who
was a member of the Educational Soci
ety, is still fresh in the public mind.
The See Yup Society had been vigor
ously fighting the Educational Society.
Every member of the latter organiza
tion was slated to be slain, $500 being
the price put upon each head. Tom
Yick was filled with bullets in front
of Quan Quock Wah's liquor store on
Ross alley a year ago last May. Quan
Quock Wan and Ngun Lun were ar
rested and charged with the murder.
Later on when it was developed that
there was a conspiracy in which the
presidents of the twelve See Yup tongs
were concerned, nine of them were in
dicted by the Grand Jury to stand trial
for the murder. Fong Ling was one of
the presidents indicted. He turned
State's evidence and proved a valuable
Â¦witness in the conviction of Quan
Quock Wah and in the trial of Ngun
Lun. Quan Quock Wah was found
guilty and is yet to be sentenced. It
was in the trial of Ngun Lun that Jur
or J. W. Kelly claimed that E. W.
Gunther approached him to bribe hini
to hang the Jury, and said that Gun
ther dropped $150 Into his pocket. Th^
case was in Judge Lawlor's court. The
Jury was dismissed and Gunther taken
into custody and charged with bribery.
He was released on bonds and his case
is now pending. The Ngun Lun case
will be set for a new trial in a few
weeks.
Althouc'i Fong loves his wife, she has
not reciprocated his affection. Since
he has been compelled to live with the
member of the Chinese Educational So
ciety, she has. been living part of the
time in Fresno. There she fell in love
with a slant eyed individual named
Wong Ow Doy, a member of the Bing
Koo Tong affiliated with the See Yup
Society. Recently she came to the city
and tried to get her husband to ac
quiesce to a separation, so that she
might marry her newly found love.
She offered Fong $300 if he would con
sent to a divorce, but she was met with
a flat refusal. Fong loved his wife, the
mother of his boy, and sorrowed at the
thought of losing her. Again and again
she pleaded with him to have the
matrimonial bonds severed, but with
out success.
The police are inclined to think that
Ah Sow was induced to poison her
husband by her new lover, Wong Ow
Doy, who Is a member of the See Yups,
but have as yet not been able to trace
his connection with the plot.
HISTORY OF MURDER CASE.
AH SOW MADE A TOOL.
The woman. is a pretty type of the
Chinese female and when interviewed
she sobbingly said that she had no in
tention of killing her husband and that
she did not know that the soup, which
she claimed to have prepared, was
poisoned.
Fong Ling does not believe that his
wife placed the arsenic in the soup.
"She has always been a good wife to
me," he said. "I married her ten years
ago and we have a little boy seven
years old. I believe that she was
merely used as a tool by the See Yups
tong, whose leaders have wanted to
kill me ever since I turned State's evi
dence in the Tom Tick case. I think
when my wife has been in prison for
a time that she will tell who put the
poison in the soup."
Fong Ling is a merchant doing busi
ness in Spofford alley. He is fifty-four
years old and has been in San Fran
cisco for forty-four years. He was for
several years in the employ of the
Southern Pacific Railroad as steward
on its river steamers. He speaks good
English. Since his turning State's evi
dence in the Tom Yick murder trial,
there has been a reward of $500 for his
head offered by the See Yups. He has
been compelled to travel with a body
guard during the day and at night
sleep under the protecting wings of the
Chinese Educational Society.
next day portions of the soup were
sent to Dr. C. O. Southard of 121 Geary
street and Dr. E. L. Grossman of 413^
Kearny street. The physicians found
enough arsenic in the soup to kill one
hundred men. The pc-liee were imme
diately communicated with and De
tective Ryan was detailed on the case.
Ah Sow was arrested last night at her
room in a house at 8 Spofford alley
and taken to the City Prison, where her
name, was entered on the detinue book.
She may be charged, to-day.

During the supper music was fur
nished by the Alcazar quartet, which
rendered a number of popular selec
tions, goins from one hall to the other.
At the close of the supper there was
dancing in one of the dining halls and
in the American Hall. It was a full
dress affair throughout and all the
wompn were in magnificent costumes*.
Dancing v.as kept up until a late hour.
This function, the most elaborate ever
piven by this chapter, was under the
direction of the following committees:
After the supper, which was served
v ithout wines in obedience to the mod
ern dictum of "no wines at Masonic
gatherings." Dr. Roland English Hart
ley, v hu filled the office of toastmaster.
called upon the following to respond to
roasts: Grand High Priest Charles
l>e\Yis Patton, Samuel Morgan Short
ridpo. Frank Henry Gould and Charles
Louis Peter Marais.
A pretty souvenir programme of the
<-vent was presented to each one who
occupied a seat. Within the leaves was
a f kÂ«~t< h of the chapter, a steel en
graving of the emblems, the menu
and the list of the officers and commit
tees.
California Chapter Xo. 5. Royal Arch
Masons, celebrated the fiftieth anniver
sary of its institution by a banquet and
ball at the Palace last night.
This v.as an affair strictly for the mem
bers of the chapter, their wives, their
femin'ne lelsthes and only three spe
i ially invited guestsâ C. L. Patton, tlvj
prand high priest of California,' the
high priest of Fan Francisco Chapter
and the high priest of Mission Chapter.
Thtrf? were covers for 750, pet in three
hallsâ Maple Hall. Marble Hall and the
ladies' grillroom. The several halls
vere decorated with smilax, carna
tions, maiden-hair fern and asparagus
:ern on drapery of red on the walls.
while the tables were strewn with
Street peas and pinks distributed in
srailax and ferns, with tiny baskets
tilled with carnations, banking large
Â« andelabra with red shades.
Along the highways of China now
rides Tueri Fong, imperial herald,
shouting the following proclamation of
the Empress:
"The Daughter of Heaven no longer
considers abbreviated tootsies beauti
ful. She' graciously permits that the
wc-men of China may wiggle their toes
whenever they please."
Hearing of this edict the parents of
four local Chinese beauties immedi
ately countermanded the order for the
suppression of the feet of their daugh
ters. Miss Wai Kue has for the first
time been able to verify the report that
she had ten toes. Miss Ng'Teng is
playing hop scotch on her father's roof
garden. Miss See Fa Is admiring a
new pair of Oxford ties. Miss Wong
Laam wants jade rings for the "new
fingers" at the end of her feet, which
she saw for the first time yesterday.
All four fervently sing the praises of
the Empress who made the startling
discovery that women's feet were made
to walk on. It took the Chinese a little
less than 2000 years to find it out. That
is progress and it is certainly going
Of course the more conservative
Chinese mourn the passing of the "lily
feet," so callfed, but the edict means
business. With it a law was passed
forbidding further manufacture of the
Ting wooden shoes. These are the in
struments of torture in which the
Chinese girls' feet are incased to pre
vent their growth. '
The example of these four maidens
will soon be followed by other cramp
ed-footed of Chinatown.
Because of a recent edict of the
Empress of China four little-footed
maidens of Chinatown have removed
the bandages from their feet. The
girls do not care now whether or not
their "TrDbys" reach the traditional
Chicago size. Little feet will soon be
as unfashionable among Chinese as the
venerable hoopskirt of our grand
mothers.
Johnson says he was engaged by the
merry party at about 6 o'clock p. m.
in frpnt of the Palace Hotel. They
hied them to the beach and listened
to the music of the seals. The harmony
of popping corks was also included in
the evening's repertoire. But a perfect
evening's enjoyment was marred by the
refractory conduct of the auto. It
pranced like an Arizona mustang.
Miss Wilder began suit yesterday
against Gerstley for $5300. The $300 Is
to pay for medical attendance necessi
tated by the accident. The $5000 is
asked becauseâ as she allegesâ Miss
Wilder Is now unable to follow her vo
cation. Though the physical injuries
resulting from the wild ride are healed,
the plaintiff is still suffering from the
shock caused by Gerstley's lack of gal
lantry. Miss Wilder was formerly a
stenographer employed by the Merrals
Mill Company. She gave as her ad
dress at the time of the accident 409
Golden Gate avenue. This is the rear
entrance of an all-night restaurant,
where automobiles back up to the door
at all hours.
To be ungallant even in these days
may be costly, if Miss Emily Wilder,
stenographer, wins her suit, filed yes
terday in the Superior Court. The fair
plaintiff alleges that on May 7 one Fred
Gerstley invited her to Journey to the
Cliff House in an automobile. The auto
was perfectly tractable on the way out,
but on the return trip it tried to climb
trees. On the slope of Strawberry Hill
the machine turned what is known in
acrobatic parlance as the '"back flip."
The entire party, consisting of Miss
Wilder, Miss Marguerite Phipps, Mr.
Gerstley, the host, and Frank Johnson,
the chauffeur, was buried under the
benzine buggy. Instead of investi
gating the catastrophe Gerstley sud
denly remembered an engagement and
disappeared. Miss Phipps also made
a hasty exit from the scene of the dis
aster. So Miss Wilder alleges.
Another buzz car of milder temper
came in sight and bore Miss Wilder
and the chauffeur to the Park Emer
gency Hospital. Dr. O. S. Kucich, the
surgeon on duty, found the young
woman badly bruised arid suffering
from a slight concussion of the brain.
She was removed to the French Hos
pital the next day and remained
there for some time. The driver of the
erratic mobile sustained a fractured
clavicle.
