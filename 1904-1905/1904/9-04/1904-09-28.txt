Nicholas Michaclovltcli Seems Certain
to Be Named Armies' Chief.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 27. â Al
though an official announcement to
the effect is not expected immediately,
since it. will require some little time
to get Russia's second \u25a0 army in the
field, the designation of Grand Duke
Nicholas" Michaelovitch, the inspector
general of cavalry, as commander in
chief is regarded as practically set
tled. The situation at the front, with
two â and, perhaps, ultimately, three
âbig armies is considered to demand
above all else that the supreme com
mander be of such personal authority
as ", to be beyond jealousies and the'
possibility of intrigue on the part of
subordinates, and such a man the Em
peror now realizes can be supplied
only in the person of a member of the
imperial family. Grand Duke Nich
olas is regarded as being extremely
well fitted for â¢ this great responsibil
ity. . He will not rely upon a single ad
viser, but upon a staff comprising the
ablest strategists of the general staff,
who in reality will constitute a board
.of direction of military operations.
Viceroy Alexieff is regarded as al
most, certain to return here. The re
port that he . may become Chancellor
of the empire is exploded. He is more
likely to retain his title and come to
St. Petersburg nominally in the . ca
pacity of adviser, of the Emperor and
thus efface himself as a factor of the
military situation, in the Far East. .. \
The latest development in the. sit
uation* at the front is the definite es
tablishment of the fact that 'Field
Marshal >Oyama has .not begun to

GOVERNOR OP -WISCONSIN AND
LEADER OF THE ANTI-STAL
WART FACTION.
Ccrtelyou and Mr. Taggart are both
exercising a pause in Wisconsin. The
Republican factional fight in the State
has brought the national campaign,
so far as influenced by both national
committees, to this extraordinary pass.
-Ttrnsaxn there. h*s . been ; absolutely ,
nothing doing here." And this in face
of some spirited editorials in Demo
cratic newspapers that no doubt re
flect the opinion of somebody, labeling
her thirteen representatives in the
electoral college as "Wisconsin's vital
vote."
Of course this_Js rot, but nobody
who knows him will suppose that Mr.
Roosevelt, at least, views the inane
spectacle with patience.
It is this way â supposing you have
not noted it before: What the na
tional committees have to do in pros
ecuting their campaign in each State
they do through the State central
committees. In Wisconsin there are
two Republican State central com
mittees and it remains to be deter
mined which is "the" central commit
tee. Each represents such a following
as to enlist Mr. Cortelyou's profound
respect. And without regard to that
there are rules of propriety that must
be observed, even in politics, and, see
ing that the matter is in court, there
was nothing else to do save to do
nothing. The case was submitted by
the so-called Stalwarts and' the issue
joined by the so-called Halfbreeds
and the Supreme Court is due to ren
der Judgment to-morrow.
QUESTION TO BE' DECIDED.
The decision will say which of the
two factions is "regular,", is .entitled to
the name of' "Republican" and may
taJce precedence on. the big Australian
ballot. Mr. Cortelyou will then, know
with which chairman' he shall deal,
and to the address given will be con
signed such a prize lot of spellbinders
and such tons of literature as will
keep the political digestion sizzling to
aFsimilate between that and election
day. . . ,.
But the decision will by no means
clear up the situation' In this ready
fashion. It- all depends. 'S. A.
Cook, who is the nominee for Governor
on the Stalwart ticket, has announced
that he will abide by the judgment of
the court and If the convention that
nominated him was not the "regular"
Republican convention he will retire.
The chairman of the Stalwart commit
tee has said that such action on- Mr.
Cook's part would not end the matter,
but would necessitate the committee
filling the vacancy, as the convention
gave it power to doâ but there are not
many who believe this..
On the other hand should the court
say that the Stalwart convention, was
the thing, as the Republican National
Convention said it was, nobody believes
that it would have the slightest effect
on the campaign of Governor La Fol
lette, except to cause him to hustle a
little more. This, of course, adds Im
mensely to the interest in the decision.
TAGGART, TOO, IS WAITING.
But why should Mr. Taggart hold
aloof from Wisconsin pending the set-,
tlement of a Republican dispute? He
is waiting to discover if Wisconsin be
a doubtful State. With the two Re
publican tickets in the field Mr. Tag
gart will get very busy in Wisconsin,
hoping to capture those vital 13 votes.
With the Stalwarts out of it and La
Follette left alone to confront his Dem
ocratic opponent, the Democrats would
make no extraordinary- effort In the
State. \u25a0 It Is reasonable to suppose,
therefore, that Mr. Roosevelt is some
what interested in the decision him
self, as well as all good Republicans.
And It is reasonable to suppose, too,
that a decision that removed Wiscon
sin from the possibility of a doubt
would not be displeasing to him and
to them. . '::-. \u25a0:: \; ;^
It is frankly stated that these con
siderations bring to the cause of the
Governor a heap of sympathy that
might not otherwise be on exhibition,
and, on the other hand, they work to
the infinite embarrassment of Sena
tors Spooner and Quarles, Representa
tive Babcock \u25ba and their -.. following,

LONDON, Sept. 28.â A dispatch to
the Standard from Liaoyang, dated
September 26. says that the crisis at
Port Arthur is rapidly approaching.
The speedy capture of the last line of
defenses is expected. The recent suc
cessful assault by the Japanese sealed
the fate of the fortress, enabling the
besiegers, to. mount heavy, guns. on hills
to the eastward, which command a sec
tion of the town and harbor. The.Rus
sian fire for many days has not been
as vigorous as usual' and it is believed
that ammunition, is scarce. The corr
rosp&ndfent confirms -tnÂ£' 'reports -of
severe' bombardments, severe losses of
the garrison and the' cutting off of the
main aqueduct supplying the fortress
with water. , . <\u25a0â¢
CONSTANTINOPLE, Sept. 28.â The
movements of the Russian Black Sea
fleet are attracting attention. The ves
sels recently suddenly sailed at night
from SebastODol and have not been
sighted since. It is stated that the
Sultan has ordered that a sharp watch
be kept for them at Turkish ports on
the Black Sea. There are suspicions
in some quarters that the ships will try
to slip through the Bosphorus at night,
when Turkey, in the face of the accom
plished fact, will be powerless and pro
tests from the powers will be risked or
ignored.
MUKDEN, Sept 27. â The Russian
cavalry west of the railroad report an
important Japanese movement and a
threatened attack. No change east
ward is reported. Four divisions of
Japanese remain at Bentsiaputze;
three divisions are supposed to be near
the iYentai mines and two others west
of them. General Mistchenko reports
that he. penetrated to the Yentai
mines and found only small detach
ments of Japanese there.

BUTTE. Mont.. Sept. 27.â When Sen
ator Fairbanks and his party arrived
here they found the Republican lead
ers greatly exercised over the publica
tion in the Miners' Magazine, published
at Denver by the Western Federation
cf Miners, of what purports to be a de
nunciation of labor unions by Presi
dent Iloosevelt, and a denial of its au
thenticity by the President. The Pres
ident's contradiction was Bent to for
mer Senator Lee Mantle, in response
to a telegram of inquiry from him, and
tvas as follws: .
-WHITE HOUSE. WASHINGTON/
Sept. 26.â Hon Lee Mantle, Butte,
Mont.: Your telegram received. The
letter you refer to, purporting to be
addressed by me to Mr. Michael Don
nelly and printed in the Miners' Maga
zine of September 22. is, of course, an
absurd and impudent forgery. I have
written no such letter, or any letter
even resembling it to Mr. Donnelly or
any one else. I have written Mr. Don
nelly requesting to know if he has re
ceived any such letter and requesting
him, if so, to at once lay it before the
District Attorney of Chicago to find
out whether it is possible to discover
and punish the forger.
"THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
The letter, in which the President
t\ as repa eswrrcg- r? tii <. r raarg*tny ar-'
tack upon union labor, was addressed
to Donnelly, president of the Butchers'
and Meat Cutters* Union of Chicago.
The document is given in full, with
President Roosevelt's name attached,
but without date, and it stated that it
was written in response to a? appeal
by Donnelly to him to interfere for the
settlement of the late butchers' strike.
The following are some extracts from
it:
"I stand ready to do as did my illus
trious predecessor. Grover Cleveland,
did. and assert the power of this nation
against all local nulliners.
"Last summer I felt impelled to
writ*; a letter calling upon my country
men to put down lynching. But labor
union terrorism and crime are as great
a national menace as lynch law.
*'I>?t me tell you the first duty of the
officers of the law. whether th^y be
Sheriffs. Constables, municipal officers.
Mayors, Governors, or the President
himself, is to maintain public order
and put down the mob with an iron
hand."
After advising Donnelly to put a
etop to thÂ«i strike, the President is rep
resented as saying:
"In any case be assured I will keep
my hands off unless your folly brines
you into collision with the laws of the
United Ftates. when my hand will go
on in a way you will not like. So far
as I am concerned, you have barked up
the wrong tree. I am not to be either
wheedled or frightened into meddling
\dth what is none of my business."

the plaintiff's solicitor is M. Haquin,
while from this side the case is being

that in the event of the full amount of
money paid to Professor Doyon for his
treatment of Mrs. Crocker during the
part of April and May last, or any por

Elmer Sparr, a young man recently
from Oregon, sought to board it again.
As he ran along beside the track
ready to swing himself on the rods he
failed to notice a , trestle and fell
through it, a distance of twenty feet.
One shoulder was dislocated and he
received injuries to his head that have
left him in a comatose condition. The
physicians at the hospital here fear
that Sparr is injured Internally and
believe that his injuries will prove
fatal.

CALIFORNIANS AT THE FAIR.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27. â Pension
Commissioner Ware to-day said the
cost of a service pension law such as
Judge Parker suggested in^Is letter of
acceptance would be from $25,000,000
to $40,000,000, depending upon the
unknown number of veterans now
unpensioned and upon the administra
tion of the Jaw.
"President Roosevelt's order," said
Ware, "simply anticipates by a few
months, .or a few years, what the vet
eran could get any way and the
amounts that are paid out by reason
of it, although difficult to compute, are
comparatively small, especially .In
view of the saving which it makes in
administration." VlsÂ«5

that the late Senator Benjamin F.

man. At one time he was supposed
to be one of the wealthiest men of

up to a few years ago. He was the

the great Langford orchard colony
being of his foundation. As one of
the original company manufacturing
a combined harvester, as a banker
and in many other ways he was sup

Although it was known that his

The movement of Japanese forces
on the Liao River, which was report
ed in a dispatch from General Sakha
roflf to the general staff on September
26, is all the more significant since
Sianchan is the starting point of roads
leading to Tie Pass, Aiukdet: and Sin
rr.intin. The {tnnouneement that the
Russians are fortifying Fakoman,
twenty-five miles northeast of Muk
den, shows that General Kuropatkin is
preparing to check the flanking
movement on Tie Pass from the west.
In case Sinmintin should have to be
evacuated.
The entire absence of news from
Port Arthur, it is feared, indicates a
closer blockade there. Hitherto dis
patches from General Stoessel have
been coming through semi-weekly.
The Admiralty has not received any
details of the reported sea fight off
Aniva, at the southeastern extremity
of Saghalien. The Vladivostok squad

Sir Hubert Finley, Attorney
General of England. Unable
to Attend the Convention
It was to Webb Pearce of the Alame
da county display that the Texan un
bosomed himself and sounded the note
of warning. "You fellows out there
are going to ruin yourselves," he said;
"why, you'll have a dozen States pro
ducing all sorts of fruits and driving
you out of business if you keep on
showing yourself off like you are doing.
Look at the effect of your display at
the Chicago Fair and the stories about
a man buying two acres of land on
credit and asking for an option on the
Gould properties five years afterward,
and all off apricots or Tokay grapes.
Every State that thought it could grow
fruit began booming the industry.
Some people went broke, because their
fruit wasn't good? Of course, but that
won't stop them. You know the gen
erally accepted theory outside of Cali
fornia now is that if a sufficient acre
age of fruit trees is planted the cli
mate will change so as to mature the
fruit properly. That's what I hear on
the low down Is the secret of Califor
nia's good fruit. Just the same as the
theory that forest trees bring rain.
Oh, some of us fellows in other States
are getting wise and we are going to
break in on this good thing that Cali
fornia thinks she has all to herself."
"Well, while they are all waiting for
their orchards to produce, all we ask
is that they sen* out to Alameda for
their fruit supplf ," said Pearce. "We'll
try to lay up a little money from those
sales before competition kills us."
As a. matter of fact. Texas has com
missioners in California now and has
had at various times for. years, gath
ering all possible information concern
ing the growing of fruits and grapes
and soil and climate. That State is
working hard to promote the fruit in
dustry. Its display at this fair, how
ever, doesn't show it to be any serious
rival of California at present and one
of its representatives here has been
heard to say that it could beat any
State in the .Union in fruit growing
"except California." It will be an im
portant fruit producing State some
day, though.
There is a man in one of the Texas :
exhibits who has an original idea con- |
cerning the effect of California's ad- \u25a0
\u25a0vertising at the fair. Some original ;
ideas are novel and some are amusing, j
but his is both. He sees the same dan- j
ger to California from her advertising .
that some people imagine will befall '
the Caucasian nations through the en- j
lightenment of Japan and China. â a,
danger that California will be undone .
by enlightening competitors. His idea ,
is that California should practice the i
clam act, as against tbe rest of the.
United States, and not let others know,
of the profits from her orchards and
vineyards, so she can keep the busl- i
ness all to herself and let the other de
luded regions, with warm climates, go
on raising buckwheat and squash-
Texas in particular.
GALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILD
ING, WORLD'S FAIR, Sept. 27.â
Eastern Knights Templar who attend
ed the conclave in San Francisco have :
been prominent on the World's Fair
grounds since that event, most of them
huving taken the opportunity to "..visit
the exposition on their return home.'
The Knights have come -back filled
with, feelings of the highest" regard for
the Golden State and its metropolis
and they have made themselves par
ticularly at home at the California'
and San Francisco buildings. At both
those places it became peculiarly jio
ticeable that they refused to accept
any hospitality in the way of wines or
other cheering beverage, even eschew-^
ing the claret punch served at, the Cal- :
ifornia building.
"Why is it you people never \ drink
anything?" asked State Commissioner
Wiggins of one of the Knights, his cu
riosity over the phenomenon becoming
uncontainable. - "I never heard that
you had a blue ribbon auxiliary and
even if you never dranK anything be
fore in your lives, a trip to' California
should teach you that the vineyard
has something good to offer." â¢_
-*'Ah, that's just it," replied the
Knight addressed, and. his hand went

TEXAS MAN'S THEORY
STATE TO "BEG PAKDON"
The La Follette men, the Half
breeds, must, in case the decision of
the court favors the Stalwarts, take
some other name than plain "Repub
lican" in order to get on the ticket at
all. So, in case both factions are on
the ticket there must necessarily re
sult great confusion which must in it
self cost Mr. Roosevelt many votes.
Should the Stalwarts take the place on
the ballot of the regular Republican
ticket and should they on the ticket
leave the place of the electors vacant â
a strange thing for a regular Repub
lican ticket in a Presidential contest â
how many of the rank and file having
voted that ticket "straight." would
turn to some other ticket to vote for
the Presidential electors, or rather, how
many would there be who would for
get to do so?
It will be seen that a nasty situa
tion exists in Wisconsin which is to
be vitally influenced by to-morrow's
decision of the Supreme Court to be
rendered on the 27th. If Judgment
favor3 the Stalwarts, Wisconsin be
comes a doubtful State. If it turns
down the Stalwarts it is not likely. In
view of all these circumstances, that
they will press their canvass, and by
a change of name still seek a place
on the ballot. The letter of Mr. Cook,
announcing his purpose to abide by
the decision, is accepted as an indica
tion to this end, although members
of the following are fond of saying
since its publication that he is not the
Stalwarts. Those who know who the
Stalwarts are, how that their leaders
are big in political Influence and were
quickly accredited at the National Con
vention and how they are deemed
among the | President's stanchest
champions, can nevertheless easily un
derstand why thev get but little com
fort Just now at Mr. Cortelyou's office.
CONFUSION IS CERTAIN.
j The Halfbreeds will tell you that
I the Stalwarts were mere bolters from
| the regularly called convention, and
j that : the. State Committee certified to
I its work, v The Stalwarts will point
you. to the decision of the national
! convention in their favor and declare,
i as they did to the . court, that the
: State Committee was not competent
! to -pass .judgment in a matter in
j which a majority of its own members
1 were personally interested. The
\u25a0 Halfbreeds will quote from the lan
guage of the chairman of the com
mittee of three reporting to the na
tional convention that their decision
had nothing to do -with the State
ticket and refer to the fact that the
contention in court ia predicated on
the proposition that the national
convention is the highest- political
power and the claim of the Stalwarts
that there is nothing therefore for the
court to do but to follow it in its
decision, while yet that convention
had refused to assume responsibility
in this matter and had practically
submitted it to the court for determi
nation. -
But whatever the judgment of the
court, there is no doubt that Governor
La. Follette, will go right along with
his campaign. Should it favor the
powerful faction of which Senator
Spooner is the leader, and thus leave
the two factions at active warfare
through the campaign, George W.
Peck, Democratic nominee for Gov
ernor, has better than a fair qhance for
election and Democrats even hope to
carry the State for Parker as a result
of the dissatisfaction and the confu
sion which will result in the voting
booths.
Senator Spooner promised that the
national ticket should not be endan
gered by the defection of the Stal
warts. He thought to keep his prom
ise by placing on the Stalwart ticket
for electors the same thirteen names
that were on the Half breed ticket.
But there is a provision in the election
law of Wisconsin, placed there by Re
publicans to defeat fusion, that has
remained to plague these Stalwarts^
No name of a candidate may appear
upon two tickets. The electors nom
inated by both conventions were asked
to designate which ticket they would
go upon before the people. They
chbse the La Follette ticket. Now,
if the Stalwarts are declared "regular"
and are given first place on the big
ballot two things remain to be done.
The Stalwarts must name other thir
teen electors and so divide the Repub
lican vote, on the national ticket, or
they must leave the place vacant and
trust to the election, by the aid of
their own votes, of the men on the 'La
Follette ticket, which, .by the decision
of the court, will have been declared
to be not the regular Republican
ticket.
known though they be as Stalwarts.
This fact â that the defeat of the
Stalwarts and their elimination from
the situation would be to the benefit of
the Republican national ticket â does
not of course argue one way or the
other as to the justice of their cause.
This is the -more irritating to them,
of course, believing their cause to be
just. Neither is, the question of the
right or wrong of party management
or policy a question before the court.
It is simply one of "regularity" â
which convention- was governed by
the statutes provided in such cases.

Sir Knight Wm. H. Maneely of 1904
N. 17th st.. Philadelphia, a member of
Mary Commandery. called at our office
during the Conclave last week and told
of his wonderful escape from death. He '
handed his card and opened up the con- '
Venation by saying, "Do I look like a I
tnsui who was dying with Brieht's l>is- !
casp a year a^o?"
.Me stated that he had had both Briffhfs
disease and diabetes for nine years, and ,
B year ago was so low he could not I

â . a leading physician of Philadel-

would cure him. He sent for it. and the
third night thereafter got the first good I

He Â»tated that .Richard Filbert, an-

recovered from Brlghfs disease and was
bo interested that he had probably given
over a hundred bottles of Fulton's Com-
pound to friends to get them started
â¢â¢ind that he had -Â»glven away aver two
dozen himself; also that he had induced
a doctor whose wife had diabetes to pre-
scribe it for her, and that the doctor
4iow admitted that "a miracle was being
performed, for his wife was recovering."
He also told a trained nurse who was at-
tending a wealthy citizen who was fad-
ing away with Bright's disease. A month
later he called on Mr. Maneely to tell
him ' that tbe patient was so improved
and so grateful to tbe nurse that he told
"him if it kept up a year he would give
him $6000.
-Mr. Maneely also mentioned two resi-
dents of Kensington, a suburb of Phila-
delphia, whom he had started on it and
had recovered.
He added that E. T. Snow of 1816 Co-
lumbia avenue had told him that there
wore now fifty-two physicians in Phila-

As for himself, McKinlay said, for
weeks he has been advancing . argu
ments of the principles of the Hepubll
can party and that many Democratic
papers have found fault, not with the
arguments, but because he was born in
Canada. The speaker admitted the soft
impeachment, but stated that he came
to the United States when , he was . 16
years of age and learned the painters'
trade in Michigan. He came to Cali
fornia and worked , for nearly, a , year
in San Francisco. He .then came to
Sacramento, where . he , worked at! a
shop on Third street.- , -
He said In the United States there
are now 7,000,000 men employed in in
dustrial avenues with average earning
power of $14,000,000 a day, thus creat
ing an immense output. The United
States was formerly satisfied with the
home market, but the time has now
come, he said, when we must dispose
of our product among other nations.
Our exports now are $1,500,000,000 an
nually, of which $500,000,000 worth are
manufactured products. A change of
the national policy at this time would,
added McKinlay, endanger this pros
perity. .
In regard to the Philippines -the
speaker said It was the duty of this
nation to uphold civilization there.
As to the tariff question, which he
said benefited the workmen, business
men and farmers, McKinlav said the
Republicans are not making an issue
of the matter, and that the Democrats
have "gone back to this issue which won
for them by luck in 1892.

brilliant, torchlight procession through
the principal streets an immense mass
meeting was held in the old pavilion,
which was attended by a crowd of
more than 2000 people. Both Congress
man McLachlan and McKinlay were
heartily applauded when they took
their seats upon the platform. Charles
F. Curry, Secretary of State, presided
over the meeting, and after a few re
marks introduced McKinlay, who was
greeted by a storm of applause as he
arose to sped%
McKinlay strongly indorsed the pol
icy of President Roosevelt, and referred
to the record he has made during his
three years in office. He spoke very
feelingly upon the death of President
William McKinley and the sorrow that
the sad event cast over the nation. Mc-
Kinlay was in Buffalo at the time of
the assassination of President McKin
ley and spoke upon this matter from
personal knowledge. '
McKinlay spoke with much enthu
siasm upon the canal across the Isth
mus of Panama, which will cut off
9000 miles of the sea route from San
Francisco to New York. He said when
the two continents were severed and
this canal was completed freight rates
to the East would be reduced, and with
the needed improvements in the Sac
ramento River completed, Sacramento
would once more become an important
shipping point. The speaker said he
favored the upbuilding of the navy,
which is now second among the nations
of the world in fighting capacity. He
also favorably mentioned the reorgan
ization of the army and the laying of
the Pacific cable. iy.'?'?.':

The officers of the liner, however,
pave little satisfaction to those who

Far.e. John Hauser, the chief steward
cf the Fteamtr, which is now in port at
Hoboken, said to-day to The Call cor
respondent that he had been ap
proached by a lawyer, but that he could
not recall ihat MI?s Dolbeer' acted in
any way that miÂ£ht suggest insanity'
while she was a passenger. He re
ferred the lawyers to William Poppen
diak, deck steward of the ship, who
told them that Miss Dolbeer had con
ducted herself in a way that indicated
the was perfectly sane.
Harry Schander, an uncle of Miss
Dolbeer, who lives at Sacramento, and
other relatives, have employed lawyers
to contest the will. Hiram and Albert
Johnson of San Francisco are among
those engaged.
NEW YORK. Sept 27.â Lawyers
from San Francisco are now in New
York preparing to wage a vigorous
warfare in the courts against the will
of the late Miss Bertha M. Dolbeer.
who leaped from a window of the Wal
dorf-Astoria Hotel.
A special commission will come here
from San Francisco within the next
few days to take testimony with a view
to proving that Miss Dolbeer was of
unsound n::nd when she made her will.
The captain, purser, steward and deck
hands of the steamship Deutschland.
on which Miss Dolbeer traveled here
from Europe, have already been inter
viewed by a man who gave his name as
Stilwell and who said that he repre
sented some of the heirs who will con
. test the will.
"The Dingley bill was introduced. It
was a common thing at that time for
a grower to receive a bill for the
freight on his shipments â all the value
he received. I have seen fruit from
Italy discharged at Eastern ports by
the thousands of boxes. The California
orchardist had no chance competing
against cheap labor.
"When the Dingley bill was reported
by a Republican committee it raised
the duties on fruits over the Wilson-
Gorman bill from 80 per cent to 50
per cent. 'I' followed that bill to the
threshold of the door of the House of
Representatives. Barlow, who succeed
ed me, told me at the door that this
far you may go, but no farther, and I
had to acknowledge the fact.
"When that bill came up for final
passage the Minister of France and
the Minister of Italy went from house
to house begging the members of the
Ways and Means Committee to report
unfavorably, as its passage meant the
ruin of French and Italian vineyards.
And when Barlow's name was called
in the final vote he voted in favor of
the French and Italian vineyardlsts.
The blush of shame came to my face
as he recorded his vote against the
interests of California and against the
interests of its greatest industry.
"The same condition will soon prevail
again. The revision of schedules in the
Dingley bill must be made and who Is
to make the changes?
"I ask for a single reason why any
Republican should support a Democrat
under such circumstances.
"Your rivers need improving; the Re
publicans have the organization. The
majority. In each committee is Repub
lican. Do you suppose that a member
of the minority can obtain the same re
sults? I urge every citizen to cast his
vote for the man who represents the
dominant party which must provide
for the improvements that are required
and demanded by this section."
change in this respect. I can recall
General Barnes, Sam Shortridge and
George A. Knight.
"If it is true that President Roose
velt, should be re-elected, why should
any Republican cast away his ballot
and tie the hands of the President?
â¢'Ten years ago I was first elected. In
the silver flood I was defeated. My op
ponent went around and begged the
votes of Republicans. The great fruit
industries hired me at $400 a month to
stay in Washington and help frame
the Dingley bill. They could not trust
their representative, who could do no
less than be true to his own party.
"Every industry in California was
promptly paralyzed by the free trade
ideas of Mr. Cleveland. I remember as
I traveled through this country find
ing the storehouses bursting with crops
that could not be sold.
BILL. IS INTRODUCED.
The Johnsons, so-called, were peo
ple of tone and their neighborhood is
scandalized.
The deserted woman was prostrated
by the news, but her failure to make
any legal claims on her erstwhile com
panion is regarded as corroborative of
his private statement that he was free
to marry.
Last week he went to San Francisco
and it now appears that he took the
Horn girl with him and they took out
a marriage license.
STOCKTON, Sept. 27.â G. D. John
son, a handsome drug clerk, has eloped
with and married a pretty domestic,
Miss Carrie M. Horn, leaving behind
the handsome woman known as his
wife, and a child reputedly his own.
The Johnsons came to this city and
established themselves in a good neigh
borhood. He held a good position un
til his attentions to the pretty Miss
Horn aroused the resentment of his
employer and he Avas discharged.
His actions suggested that he was
intoxicated and he was carried off to
jail. An hour later he died.
Alcoholism, aggravated by the excit
ing wolf scene. Is given as the cause of
the young man's death. Purdy was
about 30 years of age.
James Jeffries, the actor-pugilist, was
appearing in "Davy Crockett." It was
in the scene where Jeff, his arm bared
and thrust through iron loops was
barring the Ingress of a horde of hun
gry stage wolves upon the fair heroine
and child. The scene was made real
istic by the stage hands' Imitation of
the howling of the hunger maddened
brutes. Roars of thunder and flashes
of lightning made it more thrilling.
With a piercing cry and with his
hands in the air. Purdy sprang from
his seat and before those in the ad-
Joining seats could go to his aid he
fell to the floor. Ushers and friends
carried him from the theater.
RENO, Sept. 27.â Elmer Purdy, a
cowboy from "Wellington, Nev., ended a
week's debauch In Carson to-night by
dropping over in a fit of excitement at
the Carson Theater. He died an hour
later.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
W. G. Williams is scheduled to -speak
on the date given at Redding, Frank
H. Gould* at Visalia, H. C. McPike at
Oakland, Thomas M. O'Connor at Sa
linas. Jesse W. Bryan at Martinez, A.
W. Warner at San Diego. A. F. Jones
at Woodland, William M. Cannon at
Paso Roblcs at noon and at San Luis
Obispo in the evening. Franklin K.
Lane at Hanford, Theodore A. Bell and
Albert M. Johnson at Sacramento. Wil
liam Gibson at Williams and James
G. Maguire at Stockton.
The Democrats announce that this
general engagement plan will be kept
up until the call to polls is sounded
on election day.
The work of starting the Bourbon
spell-binders on their travels through
the state for Parker and Davis is pro
gressing rapidly at Democratic head
quarters. It was announced last even
ing that Thomas J. Geary would open
the campaign at" Eureka on Friday
evening next. On the same evening
William A. Kelly and Thomas M.
O'Connor will open on the voters of
Vallejo. The following day, October 1,
is reserved for the grand assault, when
no less than fourteen campaign bon
fires, including that at the Alhambra,
will blaze while orators orate.
Democrats of the city are busy pre
paring for the mass meeting to be fteld
at the Alhambra Theater next Satur
day evening. United States Senator
Francis G. Newlands of Nevada will
be the principal speaker of the evening.
Though he is not noted for his elo
quence, Mr. Newlands is an interest
ing speaker. Doubtless he will give
the people of California an illustration
or the logic that won for him the sup
port of the Nevadans and a seat in the
upper house of Congress.
Joseph S. Tobin, who is still strong
in the affections of the local Democ
racy, has been selected to preside at
the meeting. Without doubt Mr. Tobin
will see to it that the speakers are
properly introduced and the band and
the Parker and Davis Glee Club given
the signal at opportune moments to
contribute a little vote-winning music
to keep the enthusiasm at the flood.
Several interesting features are prom
ised for Saturday night and a few glad
hours are assured the adherents of
the minority party who are invited to
come and bring their friends.
DEMOCRATIC PROGRAMME.
In the several Congressional districts
the Republicans are conducting an en
ergetic and winning campaign. In the
Second District Duncan K. AIcKinlaj
and James A. McLachlan are address
ing vast audiences. They spoke to the
citizens of Sacramento last night and
thijftvening they will speak to the peo
ple'St Colusa. Next Thursday evening
they will be in Woodland.
KXEUGISTIC CAMPAIGNING.
General George Stone, chairman of
the Republican State organization,
and the members of the execu
tive committee are highly grat
ified over the reports received from
various sections of the State. The re
sults in the line of registration are not
in any sense disappointing. In fact,
Republican registration is up to the
mark. The falling off is in Democratic
strongholds. Careful and effectiva
work in the direction of bringing un
registered voters to enrollment has
produced a happy result.
Preparations are in progress for a
great demonstration at the Mechanics'
Pavilion on the occasion of the mass
meeting next Monday evening. Charles
W. Fairbanks, the Republican nominee
fur Vice President, and the eloquent
Senator Dolliver of Iowa will address
the people of San Francisco. There arc
indications that the spacious pavilion
will be crowded with interested and en
thusiastic voters.

The paper suggests the withdrawal

BOISE, Idaho, Sept. 27. â Ghouls
entered Morris Hill Cemetery In Boise
last week and desecrated the grave of
Miss May Pierce, the 17-year-old
daughter of Rev. R. Pierce, pastor of
the Church of the Nazarene, who died
of typhoid fever. The desecration was
discovered next morning, but was
kept secret by the police until to-Â»day
in the hope that the guilty parties
might be apprehended.
The body of the. girl was not sto
len or mutilated in any manner, al
though all"^her "cfothing was stripped
from the body and carried away.
There was no Jewehry buried with the
corpse. After being denuded the re

and a few inches of dirt was thrown
on the box. The motive for the out
rage is a mystery and no clew has yet
been discovered pointing to the per

OP IDAHO YOUNG WOMAN
OAKLAND, .Sept 27.â Frederick P.
McFeely, assistant superintendent of
the Judson Iron Works, and a pioneer
member of Oakland Lodge No. 171 of
Elks, died at 5:30 o'clock this morning
at his residence, 1929 Market street,
after- an illness of short duration. For
some time Mr. McFeely had not been
enjoying cood health, but the serious
condition, did not become manifest
until a week or so ago.
"Pop" McFeely, as he was known
to his familiars, was an Elk of Elks.
To the lodge with which he had been
so niany years affiliated he was a pa
triarch. Though 64 years had passed
since his birth In Toronto, Canada,
"Pop" was until very recently one of
Oakland Lodge's most active members.
He was ever at the forefront In any
thing pertaining to the welfare of his
lodge or of his brethren. - -â â - \u25a0
Twenty-flve years ago McFeely came
to Oakland. In his business relations
he occupied a high place in the confi
dence of the Judson people.
The survivllng family consists of the
widow, Mrs. Elizabeth McFeely, and
six children, who are Susan, Agnes,
Jane, Gertrude and Fred McFeely and
Mrs. Mary Kaufman. Funeral services
will be held Thursday morning at 9
o'clock at the Elks' Hall, Fourteenth
street, near Broadway, and at 10
o'clock at Sacred Heart Church, For
tieth and Grove streets.
Assistant Superintendent of
Judson Iron Works Is
No More.
Police Commissioners Listen to
Charges Against 3Iusio Hall and
Render a Decision.
The proprietors of the BelvederÂ«
appeared before the Police Commis
sioners last night to show cause why
their license should not be revoked for
violating police regulations. After
hearing the testimony of about a doz
en witnesses the Commissioners in
formed the management that tha
rooms downstairs known as the "grot
to" or "grill rooms" must be dosed
at once, or the license to sell liquor
would be revoked.
Attorney Joseph V. Coffey reprÂ«-<
sented the management of the house.
Testimony tending to prove that it
was conducted in a loose and Immoral
manner was given by Policeman Fur
man and Davey, who, in citizens'
clothes, visited the resort recently and,
according to their testimony, consum
ed $26 worth of Liquid and solid re
freshments. They were assisted in
getting away with the. eatables and
drinkables by two of the actresses em
ployed in the house. .One little bill
alone for three plates of oysters and
one sandwich, with two pint bottles of
beer, amounted to $5.
The officers said they visited tha
place, and after becoming friendly with
one of the waiters sent a note through
him to two women on the stage â Rosa
Adams and Vehne Edwards. The notÂ©
was answered, but the officers were In
formed that they could not go behind
the scenes, as the police were watch
ing the place. An appointment was
made to meet the actresses W the grill
room, and according to the statements
of the police, corroborated to some ex
tent by the women, the four had a
large time in the rooms underneath the
music hall. Beer at Jl a pint flowed
freely, the piano was used at an hour,
when, according to police regulations,
it should be silent, and one of the of
ficers enjoyed a waltz with his com
panion. Bawdy songs were sung and
Miss Adams treated Officer Davey in a
very affectionate manner, considering
their short acquaintance.
Under cross-questioning by Attorney
Coffey Officer Davey became somewhat
entangled as to time, and the testimony
given by Sergeant Donovan served fur
ther to entangle matters. After a
whispered conversation Commissioner
Drinkhouse, who acted as president,
announced that the grill room must be
closed at once or the license would be
revoked.
The case of King & Ward, proprietors
of the New Western Hotel, cited to
show why their license should not be
revoked for permitting gambling
games, was put over for a week.
The license of S. Belltraml, who has
a grocery store and bar at 301 Union*
street, was revoked. He was charged
with selling liquor to a minor.
Edward Reilly, who conducts a
saloon on East street, opposite Mission
wharf No. 2, also lost his license. He
was accused of being a party to the
purloining of a number of barrels from
the wharf. %
F. E. Winter, J. F. Dean, Jeremiah
O'Dowd, James J. Torpey and Dan J.
Collins were appointed police officers.
The Commissioners failed to reappolnt
Patrol Drivers F. P. Barbee and John
W. O'Neil.

2148 Center Street, Sept. 27.
- By reviving the bonding project be
fore the Board of Trustees last night
President Thomas Rickard has put the
city of Berkeley in a way for receiv
ing many public Improvement? that are
Imperatively necessary- President
Rickard recognizes the fact that this
is the most opportune time to put thÂ«
scheme through and as soon as the
necessary legal steps are taken the peo
ple will- be asked to vote upon propo
sitions to bond the city for schools,
sewers, streets, a new city hall, a city
wharf, parks and fire equipment.
To secure all these things It is cal
culated that it will be necessary to
spend $517,000, as per the following es
timates: City hall. $100,000; wharf, $50,
000; schools, $125,000; manual training

and the Trustees decided to make the
bond proposition the entire business of
the special meeting to be held next
Monday. flft
The suggestion of President Riwrard
that a park commission be chosen to
look after the city's parks is regarded
as 'good. According to President Rick
ard Its duty would be to "suggest
ideas for the beautiflcatlon and care
of small park areas on Piedmont ave
nue, Adeline street and Shattuck ave
nue."
The plan, having been approved
by the board, is in the hands of Town

SCENTS IN OAKLAND YESTERDAY DURINO THE ELECTION THAT "WAS HELD
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CITY SHOULD ISSUE BONDS FOR THE
PURPOSE OF PROVIDING FUNDS FOR PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
UNIVERSITY EVENTS
CLUB AFFAIRS.
OAKLAND, Sept. 27.â The bcmds hayÂ«
met â¢with defeat. Not one of them -will
be issued by the city.' Every project
included la the bonding proposition hat
been Tejected by the voters of Oak
land by a vote so decisive that there is
co Question as to Its meaning. Eleven :
proposals were made to the voters of
Oakland by the City Council, which
passed the ordinance calling the elec- \u25a0
non. It was proposed to buy land for i
parks, construct boulevards, improve J
the city wharves, build sewers and |
crosswalks, dredge Lake Merritt, build
a new City Hall and polytechnic high ]
school, improve the public library and j
build concrete culverts. The eleven
project* were, to cost the city $2,452,000. I
Bonds to pay for the Improvements I
were to be sold if the voters should bo j
elect. Each project required a two- j
. thirds vote for its adoption. In each j
Instance the required number of votes
was lacking. l
The election to-day was preceded by
a campaign conducted by the Progress
Federation's campaign committee. The ]
federation is made up of representa- j
tives of mercantile and improvement
organizations of Alamcda County.
Many meetings were held and much
literature was circulated in the at
tempt to meld public opinion in favor
of a large outlay for improvements.
Officials of the federation to-night ex- j
press regret at the crutcome of their ef- j
forts, but insist that they will be con- |
tlnued and that the improvements they
advocate are only delayed, not aban
doned.
The vote vas unusually . heavy. Op-
.position to the Central Park feature of
the bond issue developed ten days ago.
Many had expressed the opinion that
opposition to the bonding scheme would
concentrate In a light to defeat the
Central Park project and that the re
mainder of the proposals would be ap
proved- As the voting progressed,
however, It became evident that steady
and determined warfare was being
made against each of the proposals to
Improve the city.
The various items in the bond issue
6ubmitted to the voters to-day were as
follows:
Lands for public parks, including the
"Willows, BuEhrod Park, the De Fr-mery
tract, land at Fifth and Adeline streets,
$570,650; Central Park tract, 5450.000;
boulevards, $301,670: sewers, $121,440;
wharf Improvements, $15,000; dredging
Lrike Merritt, $48,000; concrete culverts,
$49,640; bituminous crosswalks. $127,000;
polytechnic high school, $143,000; com
pleting public library, $15,000; new City

â¢"Captaln Barrington," the first of the
new- plays to be done at tbe .Majestic,
took me to the uptown house last night
for the first time since its completion.
It was worth while just to see the pret
tiest theater In town. The foyer, a
palace of light, and palms and cheer
ful crimson carpetings, immediately in
vites, and 'twould be a drab play, in
deed, that could soon down its happy
suggestion. Inside the house It is the
same. The decorations are in the same
cheerful and tasteful key, as one ob
serves from seats that are all that the
blessed old Tivoli's were not. In fact,
everything conduces to comfort, and )
ome begins by being ready to enjpy
anything the Majestic curtain rings
up on.
"Captain Barrington," aa before eaid,
is this week's offering. It is a revo
lutionary drama by Victor Mapea, and
is neither worse nor better than a great
many other_plays of the same period.
Charles Richman, who produced it in
New York, found it a fairly successful
medium, and so does the Majestic
Companyâ better, much. I understand,
last night, than on Sunday night.
Things were rather lively round the
Majestic on Sunday evening, by the
way, when the play was first done.
There was a prompter in every wins,
make-ups missing, and what not, and
the silver voice of Mr. Bishop , was
heard afterward in fraternal remon
strance. At 9 o'clock, not fifteen mln
uts past â as the blackboard had' itâ
on Monday morning, the repentant
mummers went to work, and last night
the prompter took a rest. Things went
like clockwork. In fact, all that lies
within the company's not extraordi
nary powers was done with thÂ« play.
To Mr. J. H. Gilmour falls the chief
role, or rather roles. He plays the
parts of twin brothers, one a captain
in the British army, the other a lieu
tenant in General Washington's com
mand, and each ignorant of the other's
existence. The coincidence is difficult
of acceptance to begrin with and the
rather obvious effort with which Mr.
Gilmour makes his changes does not
conduce to illusion. But there are
many good points about his work. He
has an admirable enunciation, a re
fined pronunciation and a satisfying
voice behind them. Obviously Mr. Gil
mour knows his Henry Miller. His love
scenes are modeled after Miller's most
empresse methods and he has even
fleeting expressions that remind. But
serious and earnest as he is spirited at
times, capable, too, there Is quite lack
ing the note of distinction.
Seriousness and sincerity are also
Miss Grace Reals' strong 1 points. Miss
Reals assumes the part of Ruth Lang
don, who has the honor ' of saying
George Washington from her conspir
ator-uncle's plots. The actress is fairly
convincing, ready of wit, but'mechani
cal. She would never lack the word, but
could never give what lies behind the
word. It is quite possible, however,
that Miss Reals is ill-suited in this par
ticular role, some indications of a
larger aptness for comedy being In evi
dence. The ingenue, Linda Arvidson,
brings the personal note into her little
part. She is individual and charm
ing, if unevenly so. The other feminine
role is in the rhands of.- Eleanor. Gorr:
don,' late of the Alcazar. I liked Miss
Gordon much better as I last saw her â
as a pig-tailed Swedish servant lass â
than as the riding-Tiabited lady of last
night. But perhaps her black velvet
and gold stripes are responsible for the
accretion of consciousness In evidence.
Miss Gordon is handsome as ever.
Others in the cast are George Wash
ington himself, done by Theodore
Marston with due reverence, and Joe
Moulton and his father, both well
enough taken by J. D. O'Hara and
Henry Stockbridge. The settings are
handsome and the uniforms add fine
color to the pictures.

CHARGED WITH CRUELTY
A bond in the sum of 51000 as special
administratrix of the $150,000 estate of
George Monnler, deceased wine maker,
was filed yesterday by the widow, Anna
Monnier, who was appointed on Mon
day by Judge Coffey. Before the gen
eral letters of administration are grant
ed there may be exciting developments
in the contest of Monnier's will
by George Monnier Jr., heretofore sup
posed to be the dead man's son.
Mrs. Monnier has little regard for the
young man or his pretensions. She
told Judge Coffey* that he was not the
issue of her marriage with Monnier.
The father, however, in his will desig
nated George Jr. as his son and, though
cutting him off from present benefits
in the estate, provided that he should
receive two-thirds of the property held
by "his mother" at her death.
Yesterday Mrs. Monnier came per
sonally to the clerk's office to file her
bond. She was accompanied by two
aged gentlemen with one of whom she
discussed her fear of George Jr. and
his wife. The friend advised her to
keep them out of the house even If
she had to do so by process of law.
She said that she would. "Both of
them have threatened to kill me." she
declared, "and from now on I will have
one of my servants sleep with me and
; Attorney Sawyer stated that the suit
for. $25,000 was brought on the grounds
that the said sum or nearly that
amount had been paid Into the con
cern by its various claimants. Just
how much coin the company has on
hand at the present time Is unknown
to Sawyer.
According to its contract, the inves
tor pays in the sum of $1 per week for
eighty weeks and at the er\d of that
time receives $160 or twice the sum
paid in if everything goes well. But
everything did not go well with Bright
man and numerous others and they
therefore decided to start the law at
work in , an endeavor to quicken the
paying process of the, organization.
The head of the concern is M. M.
Snyder, but yesterday he was not to
be ! found. In his stead, a fair type
writer presided over the company's of
fice In the Crossley building. She did
not know where Mr. Snyder was, but
was sure he would return In a day or
so.
Another "get rich quick" organiza
tion became involved in the toils of the
law yesterday when Attorney Frank
W. Sawyer brought suit to recover
$25,000 from the Pacific Funding and
Security Company, formerly known as
the United Commercial Company. The
suit was brought in behalf of Adelbert
Brightman and others.
According to the complaint. Bright
man put in the sum of $200 and reaped
no financial* benefits from the concern.
When he saw that the chances of se
curing any of his money were growing
slimmer each day, he finally decided
to invoke the aid of the law.
. The Pacific Funding and Security
Company was organized In the spring
of 1903 under the name of the United
Commercial Company, but, for some
unknown reason, \u25a0 was reorganized a
few months ago and this time it was
launched on the commercial sea as
the Pacific FundingÂ«antl Security Com
pany.

Ira P. Wilkerson Is not going to

on April 1. and the six months fixed
by law in which an appeal can be
taken to the Supreme Court expires
next Saturday. Wllkerson's attorney,
was In the County Clerk's office
yesterday looking up the papers
in the case and the appeal will
probably be taken to-day. The point
upon which the higher court will be
asked to pass is whether or not Mrs.
Wilkerson had acauired a residence in
California at the time she commenced
her suit In October, 1903. She testified
that ehe and Wilkerson came here
from Xew York in November, 1902,
under a twenty weeks* engagement
with Fischer's Theater. She left her
household furniture in a New York
flat and paid rent for the apartments
wMle away, but said that she was not
jroir.g back to the metropolis unless
the got â¢'out of work." While here Wil
kerson went out with a traveling com
pany and his wife sought a separation
on account of his alleged undue inti
rr.acy with one of the members of the
troupe.
The Board of Education yesterday
hit upon a plan to , relieve the con
ditions existing in certain schools
whereby some white pupils have had
to be excluded therefrom owing to the
previous enrollment of Japanese pupils.
After the meeting last Monday of the
Supervisors' Finance Committee, which
decided that there was no available
funds to build a separate school for
the Japanese, a committee of Japanese
parents headed *by Bishop Harris of
the Japanese . Mission and Secretary
Richardson of the Japanese Consulate
waited on the School Directors and a
long discussion of the matter followed.
, The committee agreed that some
thing should be done to relieve the
situation and as one way out of the
difficulty declared through Bishop
Harris that it woul<J do all in Its power
to discountenance the attendance of
adult Japanese pupils in . the various
schools. It was stated that there are
quite a few Japanese over 21 years of
age who sit In the same classrooms
with boys and girls of tender years.
This was regarded as unjust by the
committee and steps will be taken to
compel the adults to cease attending
school. This was agreed to in view of
the fact that the legal school age is
between five and twenty-one. It is
hoped that this plan will result in the
non-attendance of some Japanese
pupils at the Polytechnic High School,
where white pupils are denied the use
of the lathes in the manual training
department.
Superintendent of Schools Ltangdon
yesterday issued a circular to prin
cipals ahd teachers notifying them that
In future monthly marks of pupils
should be based upon a combination of
their, oral recitation and written work.
The practice of basing the monthly
standing solely upon the result of a
single examination is disapproved. The
circular continues:
In order that the spirit of the coarse of
study may be carried out throughout the de
partment. It is essential that teachers famil
.iarize themselves not only with the work laid
down for their particular grades, but with
the entire course. Especially important is it
that the introductions to each subject be care
fully studied, since they apply to the work of
al the grades.
Owins to the chanee from vertical to slant
writing, it will be necessary to lay unusual
stress upon penmanship. The two points to
be Insisted upon are a proper position of the
band and a free and easy movement secured
by movement drills. i
The use of books for composition Is rec
ommended, but a system ofi folders or covers
to contain a pupil's exercise will be satisfac
tory. It is recommended and strongly urged
that both the boys and girls be sent to manual
training and cooklnz at the same time,' leav
lnr the teachers free to correct the compo
sition work of the class. The supervisors . of
these subjects will gladly co-operate to ar
range the hours as above Indicated.
Director Roncovleri received a letter
from a principal of another school call
ing attention to the dangerous condition
of the vaults and flooring in the build
ing. A meeting will shortly be held
at which the Supervisors' Finance
Committee will allow certain moneys
for whatever repairs are most urgent.

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Sept 27. â A
great many baseball enthusiasts who
witnessed the recent New York-Cleve
land series wondered why Jack Ches
bro did not use his famous "spit-ball"
oftener. One of the New York play
ers claims to have found out the se
cret to-day. The Cleveland team," he
relates, had basely purchased a small
bottle of tincture of capsicum, the
6ame being a liquid which is hotter
than tabasco sauce by several hundred
degrees. With this stuff did they care
fully anoint each ball put Into play.
In order to use his "spit-ball" success
fully, Chesbro has to draw his fingers
across his lips, thoroughly moistening
them. Any flnger that had rubbed
over that red-hot mess was bad med
icine for, the lips, as Chesbro soon dis
covered, ;* and the ball ; had . to be dis
carded.. In fact, they seem to .have
pretty effectually solved the problem,

Aside From the Main Event Bay CHy
CIub'6 Programme Contains
Some Lively Goes.
The main event of the Bay City
Club's boxing show last night was nor
punctuated with any undue amount of
blood. The two principals, Billy Mc-
Donald and Tom McGreal, seemed to
have it all framed up and after each
had passed out a few gentle taps Mc-
Donald suddenly cut loose with a cou
* rle of stiff jolts and McGreal sought
the carpet, where he remained till it
was all over. This happened in the
first round.
There was plenty of fight In the rest
of the programme. Harry Tenny
j.layed the game of chopping block
with Dirk Murray's head and al
* though the little red-headed man was
pame he never had a chance. Billy
Battin got George Henderson in the
second round, though he was all but
gono himself before the end finally
came. Ed Smith was handed the de
cision over Harry Baker, though the
latter youth won a mile. Chick Law
ler made Henry Maine Â«Quit in two
louuds and Ed Levin won a well
earned decision over John Ding.
In response to an Invitation L. M.
Fletcher, secretary j>f the California
State Board of Trade, visited the
Board of Trade at Berkeley yesterday
and discussed with its members the
matter of bringing before the public
the many natural advantages and pos
sibilities of the university city. The
climatic conditions of Berkeley com
pare favorably with those of any part
of California. Much interest was
shown at the meeting and the result
will be greater activity in the fu
ture. The Berkeley Board of Trade
plans to issue 20,000 booklets at an
early date. These will be distributed
by the local Board of Trade and also
by the California State Board of
Trade. Berkeley is growing very rap
idly. The population, by active pro
motion, can be increased. To appre
ciate the growth it is only necessary
to visit Berkeley ana see the beauti
ful residences and the substantial' of
fice and business buildings that are
being erected.

PORTLAND, Sept. 27.â Hastings re
placed Iberg In the fourth inning to
day after the Oaklands had scored
enough runs to win. The visitors did not
score after the fourth. Portland could
not tally after the fourth inning either,
when with four runs the team was one
behind Oakland. The first three men
up in the first inning found Iberg for a
hit apiece. This filled the bases and a
pouple of sacrifices brought home three
men. s
Portland had a chance to tie the
score in the ninth. Hastings reached
third with no one out. "Roaring
Bill" Hurley stepped to the plate. In
stead of one of his usual outfield files
that would have scored the man on
third he essayed a drive past second.
The ball bounced once in front of
Pitcher Jones and was then glued to
his mitt. Hastings had started homo
when the ball cracked against the bat
and was easily nailed. Jones pitched
good ball. Once before in the game ha
stopped a hot one. A line drive off the
bat came to him so fast he had no
choice but to nail it. Four new faces
showed up in the local team. The

Joe boxed seven fast rounds each
with Kid Sullivan and Rudolf Gross
man. Â«
Both of his sparring partners looked
pretty well battered up from Monday's
engagement, and barely lasted the
seven rounds. Bag punching and rope
jumping followed By a brisk rub-down
constituted the day's work.
Gans seems in grand condition and
says he is confident of besting Walcott.
Some of the Walcott enthusiasts who â¢
have seen him box Jack Johnson, Me-
Vey and others while in training, think
he Should rule a 1-to-S choice.
The' spectators are sure to see one
of the fastest fights ever decided here,
Both men are noted for their speed and
it seems a foregone conclusion that
Walcott will try to rush Gans off his
feet. Gans is a great defensive fighter
and can stand a lot of hustling about.
In the meantime he will be hitting
Walcctt harder and more frequently
than he has been 'hit in recent fights.
Manager Pierce pronounces Walcott
in better condition than he has been
for three years. In this time he has
fought a lot of big men, including
Sandy Ferstuson and Fred Russell, 210
pounds each: Black Bill, 200; Frank
Childs, 185; Billy Stift and George
Gardner, 170 each, and Young Peter
Jackson, 150 pounds. It will be a novel
experience to meet a man at equal
weight. v
Al Hereford saw Walcott box Holly
in Philadelphia on the 10th inst. and
thought Joe made a poor showing. It
so happened that Walcott knew he
tfas in the house and, scenting a pos
sible m&tch with Gans. fought â¢ under
a wrap, only doing sufficient work to
hold his own. Hereford did not think
much of Joe's work then, but he has
changed his opinion since.
Fifteen miles on the road in the
morning and an hour's work in the
gymnasium followed by twelve rounds
of hard boxing rounded out yesterday's
work for Walcott. At the end of it all
the hard hitting little fighter said he
wished his battle with the other Joe â
Gans â was to take place at once.
No accident has marred Walcott's
training, afid he Is rejoicing over the
return of the warm weather, which will
aid him in keeping down to weight.
WaJcott Is of the opinion that Gans
expected he would be weak at 141
pounds, and he is using every effort to
disappoint his rival.
Walcott has begun his last week's
work with" a rush, land he Is anything*
but gentle with his sparring partners,
who much prefer getting out of the :
way rather than stop one of his hard
wallops.
Joe Gans was at ,lt /hammer and
tongs yesterday at his training quar
ters at Billy Shannon's Villa near San
Rafael. He took a fourteen-mile run
In the morning. Many sporting men
from this city visited his quarters to
watch him at work. Jack Welch, who
will referee the bout, was one of the
number.
Bettors seem unable to decide as be
tween the relative ability of "Walcott
and Gans in their light Friday night.
No mo'ney has been placed on the fight
yet and there is a wide difference of
opinion as to what odds the betting
will finally touch. The opening price
will probably be even money, after
which the volume of ' coin will de
termine the odds.

The fight drew the biggest and high
est priced housÂ« of any fight ever given
In Los Angeles. Every seat and all
the standing room had been sold before
the opening. Charles Eyton refereed
the fight and his decision In favor of
McCoy was satisfactory to everybody.
McCoy surprised the crowd by going
twenty rounds, most of which- were
full of rough work. In his training
he appeared to be preparing himself
for a Fhort fight and it was the opin
ion of the betting public that If he
failed to beat Sullivan tn ten rounds he
rrÂ«>uld lose his speed and cleverness.
He finished in fairly good shape. Sul
livan fought a. game battle and. was al
ways ready to mix it. In fact, he
shewed to bettÂ«r advantage when
fisrhtin* at close range and several of
his ehcrt-arm lefts in McCoy's stomach
worried the Hoosier. There was about
five pounds difference in the jveights,
McCoy weighinc 161 and Sullivan 156.
There was considerable betting* on, the
rounds, the favorite wager being Mc-
Coy to win in ten rounds.
. Although McCoy left the ring with
out a mark, he did not escape punish
ment from body blows. Sullivan's face
was badly cut up and his nose and eye
swollen.
LOS ANGELES. Sept. 27.â "Kid" Mc-
Coy was given the decision over Jack
CTtvtn ") Sullivan of Boston to-night
at the end of twenty rounds of lighting
at the pavilion. The lisht was a fierce
one from the start, both men taking
advantage of every point that was
Khort oÂ£ actual fouling. McCoy pun
iEhod Sulli^in severely, having his
nose and mouth bleeding in every
round after the filth. Sullivan
struck McCoy low in the clinches,
but did no damage, and as
McCoy did nut claim a foul the referee
gave no attention to it. McCoy, on
the other hand, gave Sullivan the heel
of the glove in the face in the clinches
when an opportunity offered. The
crowd Jeered each man in turn. Bar
ring the unfair tactics of the men,
\u25a0which did no damage, the nght was a
good one.
Sullivan appeared in the better con
dition and, although he was groggy at
the end of several rounds and down for
the count in the twelfth, he recuperated
quickly and came back in each succes
sive round strong. McCoy tired after
the twelfth, but was so much the bet
ter tins general and boxer that he was
able to take it easy whenever he chose.
In the twelfth, which was the hard
est round. McCoy hammered Sullivan
oa the 'fact: and body until the Boston
man went down and took the count'
of nine. He managed to get to his feet
jUFt as the gong rang. This probably
saved him from a knock-out. McCoy
Ehowed all his old cleverness and gen
eralship, but did not appear to have
the punch that has won him many bat
tles. Although he landed his right
ruany times on Sullivan's jaw and
body, he failed to put him down more
than ynce, although staggering him
half a dozen times.

GRAVESEND, Sept. 27.â Thoughtful
race-goers had a stronger opinion than
ever before of the real capacity of Bel
dame when they saw the ridiculously
easy victory achieved by Stalwart to
day in the $15,000 Hindoo stakes. His
stable companion, St. Valentine, made
the running, Odom being compelled to
tap him on the side of the head on the
turns to keep him at the rail or near
It. Stalwart was last for the first mile
and a Quarter. ;
The pace increased then and as St.
Valentine retired, Broomstick assumed
command. When Stalwart began his
run, he was at least four lengths be
hind Broomstick. In the next furlong
add a half, Mr. Thomas' colt was in
front of Broomstick, thus outrunning
that fairly good colt at least five
lengths in the short distance mention
ed. Redfern pulled Stalwart up long
before the finish and the colt cantered
In several lengths in front, although he
could have won by forty yards. Broom
stick was second and heavily played.
Ormonde's Right was third. The time,

CHICAGO, Sept. 27.â Mrs! Hart Dern
ham's filly, Spencerian, added another
victory to her already long list when
she won the fourth race at "Worth to
day from the great Canadian mudder,
Reservation, which has a victory over
ClaudeVto his credit. This race was
the distinct feature of the Worth card
and the two horses had a large follow
ing. Spencerian opened at 6 to 5 and
Reservation at 4 to 5. At one time
the odds had been reversed and finally
both went to post at "even money and
take your choice" with the fllly carry
ing the bulk of the play. Port Royal,
the only other starter, *vas friendless at
10 to 1. Spencerian shot to the front
around the first turn and took a lead
ot four lengths. At the half-mile pole
Reservation moved up and many
thought he would run over Spencerian,
but when Shaver called on her again
she moved up with ease. She turned
for home five lengths in front and won
pulled up. The track to-day waÂ» the
worst seen around Chicago this season.
The time, 1:56 4-5 for a mile and seven
ty yards, stands as proof against the
track record of 1:43 1-6. The weather
was cloudy and threatening and the at
tendance only fair. Summary:

AKKUJtL SALE, TEH MILLION BOXESPresident Herbert Schmitz of the
Beard of Public Works yesterday ia
used an order notifying the United
Railroads to forthwith take ftp the spur
track which it has built from Post
street into Kearny street. Schmitz
ascertained tnat the track ; had been
laid without a permit â¢ in violation df
the ordinance on the subject.
The ordinance further requires that
any spur track niust be built at least
eleven feet from the curbing, whereas in
this instance the track ' comes within
six feet of the sidewalk. Schmitz in
his order informs the railroad company
that if it does n6t remove the track
the operation will.be performed by the
laborers employed by the Board Of
Works.
The Commissioner's of Works will
give a public trial. this afternoon at 2
o'clock in the vicinity of Market, Fifth,
Sixth, Taylor, Mason, Turk and Eddy
streets of a sanitary street cleaning
und sprinkling machine proposed to be
hired from an Eastern concern. If the
claims of a representative of the con
cern are borne 'out by the trial of the
machines it is planned to hire several
of them. It is said that with the same
force of men at present employed
sweeping the streets twice the ter
ritory can be swept with. the new ma
chines. They rent for $6 per day, but
the city will provide the horses and
drive, so the cost will ' equal that of
those now rented from local contrac
tors.

GENERAL BAQUEDANO NOW
HERE. AND HER COMMANDER.
The agitation against the opening^ of
a saloon in the new building on the
Ocean boulevard Is interesting, and the
residents of that district who are op
posed to having a roadhouse in close
proximity to tfteir homes are confidertt
that the Police Commissioners will
give them a fair hearing and refuse
the license. :. <.-
The petition against the granting of
the license, which is being freely
signed, and will be considered at the
next meeting of the Commissioners, in
part is as follows:
That we. men of common sense, and from
observation at other places similarly stituated,
know that a saloon business conducted in such
a laree building; for all that the traffic will
bear cannot and will not be conducted so as
not to give offense to our community. WÂ« are
positive that no man Is going to pay $150 per
month fur this place. and make the same par
without throwing- It open to those who are
always endeavoring to lure the Innocent and
young to ruin.*,-:
NV* know tbatUhis bulldlnsr. If licensed as a
saloon, will become a disreputable plac* In our
community, consisting . of over eighty school
children and over 20O families. It will keep
homeseekqers and property purchasers away
from making investments, depreciate the value
of our property, bring a lawless and undesir
able class- of people into our scantily policed
community and render our lives and prop
erty less safe and secure.
We do not need such a place In our com
munity; we have all the saloons that we need,
and If such a place must be opened up, let
It be opened Hi' wh*re there is no community
to be ruined thereby.
We earnestly beseech your honorable board
to heed ths cry of this small community against
this evil and deny the saloon license to said
petitioner. â¢

The Chilean training cruiser. General
liii^uedano, which arrived in this port
Sunday evening with her school of
nutishipnien, is . finishing her year's
trip around the world. She left Val
paraiso in September. 1903, and round
ing the Horn to give her middies a
tusle of the bivezcs that blow off that
siormy cape, made her nrsl port of call
thfr Falkland Islands. On the way
across the At!autic to Gibraltar they
trot their initial gale. For days the
school ship plunged in the heavy seas.
Waves swtyt the decks and the storm
npped a number of sails from the
yards. The youngsters who some day
are to officer the sturdy, little South
American republic's navy, took their
:i:s?t lesson under storm staysails and
dosi reefed topsails. Two seamen were
lest overboard, but the ship finally ran
out ot the tempest and into the Cape
Verde Islands with no other casualties.
After leaving Gibraltar the vessel
called at Malta, where a number of the
cadets, according to their own evidence,
lest their hearts to the British girls
of that stronghold. The Baquedano
P^t into Naples, Alexandria, Suez, Sing
apore, Hongkong, Chefu, Chemulpo,
"N eihaiwei, Kobe and Yokohama. The
vessel will sail from this port about
October 15, for home, calling at Easter
Inland in the South Pacific
Most of the officers or the vessel can
epeak English quite fluently, which
language is part of the education of
Chile's naval men. Even the ship's dog
goes under the English name of "Shot."
ThÂ»re are no shore schools for the ca
dets, consequently the entire five years'
-of training is on board ship. After this
period the midshipman graduate must
put in two years on a cruiser and must
have the practice of handling a ship
at sea. He must log at least 2000 miles.
If he then weathers his "exam" he gets
his commission of sub-lieutenant in the
navy. On board the liaquedano. where
steam is used only in cases of emer
gency, he Is drilled with the sails,
handling the four 4.7-inch Armstrong
rif.esâ the best that British gun-mak
ers ever turned out. and the secondary
battery of 6 and 12 pounders and
Hotchkiss firers, and is instructed in
navigation.
The cruiser is named in honor of
General Baquedano, who was com
ro.ander-in-ch!ef of the Chilean forces
when Chile whipped Peru and Bolivia
si;me twenty years ago. The officers of
the vessel are as follows:
Ca.DVa.in Luis Gomel Carreno, Commander
Jorge Mery. First Lieutenants T. Greene and

A smartly dressed young woman in a
tailor-made gov.-n of blue that fit like a
glove, a chic little hat that matched
her auburn hair, and pretty boots with
high French heels started to cross the
street at the intersection of Broadway,
Sixth avenue and Thirty-fourth street
at 6 o'clock last evening", says the New
York World in a recent Issue.
She suddenly stopped in the center of
the maze of street car tracks at that
point and looked appealingly to an ad
miring crowd that soon surrounded her.
A north bound Broadway car, a south
bound Sixth avenue car and a west
bound Thirty-fourth street car came up
and stopped within ten feet of the
blushing young woman.
"Hey, git off the track and let us
pass!" shouted an angry motorman.
The pretty young wom?n blushed
deeply and looked at him with scorn,
but did not budge.
The crowd almost blocked the street
when Policeman Walters, of the Broad
way squad, worked his -pray to thtf wo
man's side.
"What's the trouble here? Don't you
see that you are blocking the cars and
causing a crowd to gather?" demanded
the policeman. "Why don't you run
along?"
"Oh, please don't talk rudely to me,
Mr. Policeman," answered the embar
rassed little woman. "Don't you see
that I am caught?"
So saying she lifted her skirts Just
enough to show a dainty bit of lingerie
and silk stockings. Her high heels were
securely wedged in the trolley slot. Tug
as she might, the young woman could
not release herself.
"A delicate situation," quoth the big
policeman. "But you can't block tha
cars all night simply because your heels
have caught In the trolley slot. The
only way out of this Is to take off your
shoes."
The young woman's face turned scar
let as Walters got down on his knees
and began to unlace her shoes. Then
he lifted her up in his arms and placed
her in a waiting cab. It was an easy
matter then to release tne shoes.
The young woman thanked the po
liceman and drove away.

r T^ HE members of that insane Russian sect, the Doukhobors, who
I settled in Winnipeg, have been a problem for the Canadian au
*â¢ thorities. Their fanaticism runs into extreme socialism and re
ligious frenzy. They refused to pay for their land, resisted dispos
session, refused to work animals or wear wool or shoes, or anything
of animal origin. Then they stripped naked; in midwinter and
started into the wilderness over the snow in search of the Messiah.
When overtaken by the Canadian mounted police they violently re
sisted attempts to put them under shelter and Â§ave their lives. *
It is announced now that they have deserted their homes and
started on a march for the United States, and that the mounted pen
lice are trying to turn them back. If they do not succeed means
should be taken by our Government to meet them at the line. and
turn back. There is no hope for such a pack of fools, and we
do not want them added to our burdens and problems. We have
enough difficulties resulting from promiscuous immigration, in the
Mafia, Camorra and Black Hand societies, without adding these
frenzied fools and ignorant fanatics. Their ideas of the rights of
property are such that if they enter the country they will take
whatever they can lay hands on and are sure to cause trouble in
North Dakota, which is their probable objective.

Once there were two women who got
married. And the husband of the first
woman was Immensely'popular with all
her friends. Whenever they were out
at dinner or at a social gathering he
was the life of the party* and all the
other women rather envied her having
such a congenial husband.
The husband of the other, woman was
a failure as asocial light. He could
not talk to other women and he always
trotted right along beside his wife du
tifully. All the other women envied
her having a husband who was so de
voted to her. v * . \u25a0
But the first woman was not satisfied
with her husband because the rest of
the women found him so agreeable.
And the second woman was dissatis
fied with her husband \u25a0 because he
seemed to be unable to hold his own in
a social gathering. . -

change and when he went home told
his wife about it. This happened six
years ago, and she has never forgotten
it, often telling him what luxuries they
could afford if he hadn't lost the
money. Last year their son dropped
$2000 In a poor investment. "Don't say
a word to him about it," she said to
her husband. "Poor boy, he feels bad

And again at the opening of the Pan- American Exposition : "The
prosperit}' of any of us can be best attained by measures that will
promote the prosperity of all. The poorest motto upon which an
American can act is the motto of 'Some men down,' and the safest
to follow is that of 'All men up/ " At Spokane, May 26, 1903, he
said : "We have the right to ask every decent Aitierican citizen to
rally to the support of the law if it be broken against the rich man ;
and we have the same right to ask that rich man cheerfully and
gladly to acquiesce in the enforcement against his'seeming interest
of the law, if it is the law. Whether he acquiesce or not the law will
be enforced, and this, whoever he may be, great or small, and at
whichever end of the social scale he may be." And at Butte, Mont.*,
the next da)- : "In either case if he violate the law, the law is to be
invoked against him, and in so invoking it I have the right to chal
lenge the support of all good citizens and to demand the acquiescence
of every good man. I hope I will have it, but once for all I wish it
understood that even if I do not have it I shall enforce the law." .
Judge Parker's last query in the form of an issue goes to the

he says in the body of his letter: "I am in hearty accord with that

prepared for it."

pendence by its protection through the power of our navy.
In his annual message to- the Fifty-seventh Congress President
Roosevelt said: "In dealing with the Philippine people we do not
desire to do for the islanders merely what has been done for tropic
peoples, even by the best foreign Governments. We hope to do for
them what has never before been done for any people of the tropicsâ
to make them fit for self-government after the fashion of the really
free nations."
Where do the supporters of Judge Parker find the difference ?
THE Democratic candidate has at last published his letter of ac
ceptance and it is subject to comparison with the letter of Presi
dent Roosevelt. The careful reader of both will not hesitate in
making up his judgment. Judge Parker condenses what he calls
ihe issues,- and npon examination it will be observed that they are
not issues at all in"the sense of being controverted matters of differ
once between him and his opponent and between the parties which
*.hev respectively represent.
' In this condensation he says : "The issues are joined and the
people must render the verdict:
"Shall economy of administration be dernanded or shall ex
travagance be encouraged?
"Shall the wrongdoer be brought to bay by the people, or must
'justice wait on political oligarchy?
"Shall our Government stand for equal opportunity or for special
privilege?
"Shall it remain a Government of law, or become one of per
sonal caprice?
"Shall we cling to the rule of the people, or shall we embrace
beneficent despotism?'* , â¢
Ever)' one of the?c so-called issues has been answered by Presi
dent Roosevelt. In his annual message to the Fifty-seventh Con
gress he said: "I call special attention to the need of strict economy
in expenditures. The fact that our national needs forbid us to be nig
gardly in providing whatever is actually necessary to our well being
should make us doubly careful to husband our national resources, as
each of us husband? his private resources, by scrupulous avoidance of
anything like wasteful or extravagant expenditure. Only by avoid
ance of spending money on what is needless or unjustifiable can we
legitimately keep our income to the point required to meet our needs
that are genuine.*'
In his speech at the unveiling of the Sherman statue October 15,
1903. he said : "We can as little afford a dishonest man in the public
service as a coward in the army. The murderer takes a single life ;
the corruptionist in public life, whether he be a bribe giver or a bribe
taker, strikes at the heart of the commonwealth."*
At Butte, Mont., May 27, 1903, he said : "This is not and never
shall be a Government of a plutocracy ; it is not and never shall be a
Government by a mob. â¢ It is, as it has been and will be, a Govern
ment in which every honest man, every decent man, be he employer
or employed, wageworker, mechanic, banker, lawyer, farmer, be he
whom he may. if he act squarely and fairly, if he do his duty by his
neighbor and the state, receives the full protection of the law, and is
given the amplest chance to exercise the ability that is in him, alone
or in combination with his fellows, as he desires."
Related to the same subject, he said in his "Strenuous Life,"
page 109: "There are not a few public men who, though they would
repel with indignation the offer of a bribe, will give certain corpora
tions special legislative and executive privileges, because they have
contributed to campaign funds; will permit loose and extravagant
work because a contractor has political influence ; or at any rate will
permit a public servant to take public money without rendering ade
quate return, by conniving at inefficient service on the part of men
who are protected by prominent party leaders. Various degrees of
:noral guilt are involved in the multitudinous actions of this kind, but,
after all, directly or indirectly, every such case comes dangerously
near the border line of the commandment which in forbidding theft,
by implication forbids the connivance at theft or the failure to pun

About two years ago Allen was
kicked by a vicious horse. Since that

wore a plaster- cast.

he received the Injury." He has been
living in Mill Valley part of the time
and sometimes with his mother In

Mary Duran Charges the Commis

Hutton denied that' he ever had any
intention of violating - the injunction.
He denied that he ever told Captain
Duke to arrest any one coming out of

For attempting to kiss pretty Ella
Breen, a domestic at 1521 Washington
street. Edward Adair, a driver for
the Guadaloupe Dairy, was before
Judge Cabaniss, who continued the
case till next Friday.
Mr. Adair, who came from Ireland
about a year ago. was smitten by
Miss Breon's ac mt the very first time
he heard her speak, for it indicated
that sh*. too, recently trod the Green
Isle, and the more he heard It the bet
ter he liked the girl. But when he
asked hrr to favor him with a kiss.
Prior to his marriage John Wilson was
deeply enamored of the lady who jilt
ed him by becoming the wife of an
other, and after his marriage he could
net entirely forget her, especially when
he was under the influence of strong
vaters. She was known as Mrs. Nora
Miller, and at her home, 3275 Seven
teenth street, he occasionally visited
her and mouthed maudlin regrets that
.^he did not marry him. On one of
these occasions â it was last Monday â
he abstracted from one of her bird
cages five canaries, stuffed them into
his pocket?, then tucked a feather pil
low under his arm and sobbingly went
forth. Much as she pitied him, Mrs.
Miller could not let her feathered
treasures suffocate, and in order to
effect their rescue she found it nec
essary to have her lachrymose admirer
arrested. The charge was burglary.
In the court of Judge Conlan yes
terday Wilson explained that it was
not with felonious Intent he rifled the
birdcage and walked off with the pil
low. Indeed he was at a loss to as
cribe reason for what he did. He had
been drinking, and the combined in
s.uence of the liquor and his hopeless
passion for Mrs. Miller were probably
raore than his brain could stand. He
must have been clearly distracted when
he committed the larceny. If the bird
cage had been a red-hot stove he
would probably have plundered it of
its coals.
Mrs. Miller did not want to have the
defendant punished for what he did
and the Judge dismissed the charge.

one of the flrst invited to attend. Mrs.
Johnson objected to her girl's pro

objection, donned her best attire, went

A. P. Morrison, a carpenter with a
wife and six young children dependent

Morrison visiting him while he was at
work and demanding to know what he
meant by saying that he (Mr. M.) fail
ed to pay his grocery bills, a statement
which he (Mr. L.) had never uttered.
The thing became so monotonous that
Mr. Lewis would like to have Judge
Mogan put a stop to it. His Honor in

started to steal it, not imagining that
her declination was serious. She was
resisting his larcenous effort with all
her might when the lady of the house
entered the kitchen and prevented the
robbery, and when the girl declared
that Edward had never received any
encouragement to justify his conduct
the chatelaine advised her to punish
his impudence by having him arrested.
Being an obedient servant, Ella did so.
Edward, who is about 22 years of
age, avers that he would not have

that she admired him. Even when ahe

Receipts of table Grape* in small packages
were heavy and consisted chiefly of poor and
wet stock; which dragged badly at Irregular
prices. Good dry stock was eagerly sought
after, being wanted for shipment on the Pu*et
Sound steamer, and such offerings readily
brought firmer prices, fine Tokay telling up to
Â»Oc and Muscat and Bleck at 75c per orate.
Prices for the general run of offerings range*]
from 20c to 00c per crate and there was a
heavy surplus still unsold at the close. Wine
Grapes were steady for good stock, but dealers
were cutting prices on wet lots. Prices of
Nutmeg Melons and Cantaloupes declined
sharply. There were over 1200 packages re
ceived and the demand was- limited. The Ap
ple market was In good Â«hape. as trashy stock
was pretty well cleaned up and the better
grades were in good request. Most dealers
quoted $1 25 a* the top for the general market,
but occasional sales of Spttzenbergs and
Gravenstelns were reported at $1 60. Other
tree fruits were in ample supply and prices
stood as previously quoted. Receipts -of Ber

which had to be sold at low prices. There

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT FREIGHTS â Rates are now about
as established by the shipowners' combine sev
eral months ago. viz.: 23s Od for Barley and
22s 6d for Wheat â with some ships being
taken for Barley^ but none for Wheat from thl*
port, owing to the high local price of Wheat,
which prohibits exportation. Ships for Wheat
are being taken at the combination rate of
27s 6d from Portland, however. The chartered
Wheat fleet in port has a registered tonnage
of 37 900, against 43,350 tons on the same date
last year; disengaged, 87.2ttO tons, against
02 390* on the way to this port. 214,800 tons,
against 287,500.
WHEAT â Foreign futures were weaker.
Chicago was l%c higher. Minneapolis
wired: "There Is the finest kind of a cash de
mand- here to-day. John Waahburn of the
Wae=hburn-Crosby- Company, just home from
Europe talks bullish on the foreign situation
as to Wheat. He says Europe is short and
with any. reduction In the yield in Argentina
it will have to buy United States Wheat, re
gardless of price. He also says the Continent
Buffered greatly from drought and reports of
reduced production are not exaggerated."
\u25a0The Chicago Inter Ocean says: "'Pacific
Coast Wheat is likely to revolutionize the
Wheat trade ot the country,' said one of the
largest cash handlers. 'We have "been buying
there two months, and others have followed.
For years Eastern millers have refused to have
anything to do with the North Pacific Coaa.t
Wheat, but of late they have been using it
with great success as a blend and are getting
good results. So long as it can be obtained
at reasonable figures it will be extensively
used.' â¢â¢
In this market futures were easy and quiet,
following Chicago. The cash grain wai in bet

'higher prices. .

Butter is apparently on the verge of a de

plenty of stocl: on thc market.

LOCAL MAKKETS.
CHICAGO, Sept. 27.â At the opening the
wheat market showed signs of weakness, the
December delivery being %c lower to %c
hi cher at $1 10% to $1 10%. May was un
changed to %c lower at $1 11% to $1 11%.
The main factor affecting the situation at the
start was a decline in foreign wheat markets.
A number of traders who had sold short on
the sharp decline of yesterday purchased free
ly early in the day. - There was also consid
erable buying on predictions ot wet weather
in the Northwest. However, the most notice
able feature of trading and the one that seem
ingly had the greatest influence ln creating
a strong undertone was heavy purchases of
May by a leader of the bull crowd. After
December has sold at $1 10 V* prices gradually
anvauced. Slight recessions were made on
profit taking, but the general trend of values
was toward a higher level. Sentiment during
the latter part 01 the session was quite bull
ish. Primary receipts were much smaller
than the corresponding day a year ago and
a report was received from Minneapolis stat
ing that country offerings were decreasing.
Advices from abroad prophecy a big reduction
in wheat shipments from Australia and Ar
sentina in the near future, the claim being
made that the exportable surplus from those
countries was practically exhausted. Higher
urices for cash wheat In all markets of the
United States was an important aid in buoy
ing up speculative prices here. The high point
on- December was reached at $1 12%. May
sold up to $1 13%. Although all the advance
was nof maintained, the. market closed strong,
with December up at *1 12% and May l%c
higher at $1 13%.
Sentiment Jn the corn pit was inclined to
beaxishness, but the strength of wheat pre
vented any decline. Trading was rather in
active and fluctuations were within \u25a0 a narrow
ran?e. ' December closed at 00% C a gain
of %c. j ' -
Announcement of a big Increase in the
world's visible supply caused an easier tone
in oats.' December closed Vic lower at 30%c.
Provisions were steady - on a good demand
from pit traders. Small receipts of hogs and
firm prices at the years were the supporting
features. At the close^ January pork was
off 5c. lard waÂ» up 2%c-and ribs were un
changed.

Ne?v York Stock Market.
j NEW YORK. Sept. 27.â Another day of
I broad and active demand for stocks was ex-
I perienced at the Stock Exchange, lifting still
further the average level of prices. The move
ment showed some variety and irregularity,
the upward movement being decidedly uneven
and imÂ«nspÂ«Â£rsedwith occasional small reactions.
The selling- was of a character which made its
impression on sentiment and was called
"\u25a0good," which in Stock Exchange parlance
means that it appears to com* from sources
presumably well informed either on the inside
1 news regaiding properties, on the plans of cam
j i>aign of large speculative operators or for some
1 similar reason qualified to Judge wisely of
outlook for values in the market. But* this
selling, however well informed and impres
sive, was well absorbed, and was not allowed
seriously to affect the tendency of prices.
Union Pacific and United States Steel preferred
were conspicuously strong and active and two
stocks so representative of general conditions
I and dependent upon so widespread interest*
I necessarily had & large influence in determln
1 ing the general tone of the market by the sym-
I pathy their strength exerted. Advocates of
I higher prices also enjoyed another day of
I almost complete immunity of disturbing fac
tors in the day's news. Weather was favor
able for ripening the fast-maturing crops and
the weekly bulletin of the Weather Bureau
contained much to reassure the apprehensive
over both the corn and cotton crops. The
repetition of the low corn crop estimate by
President Hill of the Great Northern and
Northern Securities seemed to be ignored and
a sharp advance in Northern Securities on
the curb on buying said to be for London ac
count was one of the features of the day.
The buying of United States Steel preferred
was accompanied by the publication of esti
mates of th-a earnings of the corporation for
the current quarter, showing a sutflcient mar
gin to provide for the preferred stock. These
estimates were without any official or desig
nated authority. There were some rather
conspicuous exceptions to the general ad
vancing- tendency % made the more so by the
notable strength which has characterized them
lately. Atchlson was a marked example, its
movement being narrow throughout. The
stated need for additional capital ln the an
nual r*Dort came ln for much discussion. The
August statement of net earnings was disap
pointing. On the other hand the August
statement of the Chesapeake and Ohio, the
Central of Georgia and ths St. Louis-South
western were considered highly satisfactory,
and t*Â»e less satisfactory showing by the Cen
tral of New Jersey did not depress that stock.
The railroads continued to report Increased
gross ea mines for the third week in Septem
ber. Rumors of a strong forthcoming state
ment of August net earnings by the Pennsyl
vania also figured in the day's market. Cot
ton Oil suffered from intimations that the com
mon dividend would be passed. There were
reactions running to a point ln some of the
leader* before the day ended, and the closing
was heavy. Sterling exchange advanced, al
though the prospect is for easier money ln
London and cotton bills are quite plentiful in
the exchange market. London also bought
stocks freely on balance here tOrday. Money
was distinctly easier ln the market, ln spile of
the continued heavy outflow to the country. The
strength of sterling Is believed to be due. to
a demand on account of the maturing ninety
Jay Ic-ann, against whiih exchange hills were

choice above these figures. Dealers say that extra
choice Wheat sells readily as high aa,$14 50.
and an occasional car brings even $15. but
â¢uch Hay Is only occasionally seen. Hence It
Is not quoted. The range in all Hay quota
tions from now on will probably continue wide,
as the rain has stained and otherwise damaged
a good. deal, which will have to be sold com
paratively low when It comes in. Quotations
for other kinds show some changes.

Captain Ronificld Holds Him Respon
sible for the Grounding of the
Steam Schooner Northland.
Captain S. Bonlfleld of the steam
schooner Northland produced evi
dence yesterday before United States
Inspectors O. F. Bolles and Captain
John K. Bulger tending to show that
the grounding of his vessel off Point
Pinos on September 19 was due to
First Mate Peter E. Hedvall mistak
ing the Point Pinos light for the
Santa Cruz light.
In support of his contention he pro
duced his logbook, which showed
unmistakably that it had been tam
pered with.
In exDlanation Mate Hedvall said
that he suspected that he had spelled
Point Pinos incorrecly and that he
erased and rewrote it.
Chief Engineer Lindley testified
that the words "Santa Cruz light" had
been partly erased and "Point Pinos
light" written over them. Mate Hed
vall was on watch at the time of the
grounding. The matter was taken
under advisement.

HOWARD E JACOTT AUTHOR OP
"DOWN THE LINE." TO BE PRO
DUCED AT FISCHER'S.
At midnight Monday the names or i
74,347 voters were on the books of
the Registrar. It is estimated that I
yesterday not less than 2500 and pos
sibly 3000 voters placed their names j
on the great register and it Is ex- j
pected that fully 3500 will sign to
day. This will bring the total regis- ;
tration up to more than 80,000, a fig
ure that is significant In many ways.
In the first place, this figure demon
strates the great interest that attaches
to the coming Presidential contest.
Secondarily, the large registration dem
onstrates the great growth of San Fran
cisco. Four years ago, when the Is- >
sues between the McKinley Repub- !
licans and the Bryan Democrats were j
clear cut and permitted of no misin- |
terpretation, the registration was full, j
73,912 voters being recorded. There j
wilj be an increase over this figure j
this year of from 6000 to 7000 names,
which constitute a noteworthy addi
tion to the list of citizens of the city.
Though the registration closes at
midnight? to-night, those whose names
are on the books of the Registrar and j
who may move out of the precinct j
from which they registered have until j
midnight of October 13 in which to j
record such removal. Those that may
move after October 13 arid prior to the
election will lose their vote.
The use of the voting machines in
several of the precincts at the coming
election is attracting considerable in- !
terest and for the benefit of those that
will be compelled to struggle with the
innovation the Registrar has arranged ]
several rehearsals. The machines will i
be . used in the Thirty-first, Thirty- j
sixth. Thirty-seventh and Fortieth As
sembly districts and the Registrar is
anxious that those that will be com
pelled to rely upon them to record :
their votes be instructed in the me
chanical problems involved.
In consequence, he has announced
that the voting machines will be ex
hibited on Friday evening next at No.
98S Oak street and on Saturday even
ing. October 1, at No. 1966 Page
street. All voters will be instructed in
the use of the machines at the times
and places named. Other rehearsals
will be arranged for later dates.
Registration for # the general elec
tion, on November 8 closes at mid
night to-night. Though the registra
tion has been" heavy, demonstrating
the great interest that centers in the
coming contest, many names are yet
to be recorded and a rush to-day is
anticipated. Hopes are entertained
that no man will lose his vote; that
the issues to be decided in November
will be decided by the whole people,
and hence the Registrar issues an ap
peal to those that have not yet ap- !
peared at his office to get there early
tc-day, or in any event some time to- j
day, that they may have a voice in
naming the next chief executive of :
the nation. ' |
Charles^Wyman, accused of ballot-bos
stuffing, sought to escape preliminary
examination before Police Judge Caba
niss yesterday by appealing to Judge
de Haven of the United States Dis
trict Court for a writ of habeas cor
pus, but the petition was denied and
the hearing of the defendant continued
before the committing magistrate
without interruption. The afternoon
was spent in the introduction of elec
tion records involved in the case, and
the examination will be resumed Fri
day afternoon at 2 o'clock.
Wyman surprised the prison offi
cials shortly before noon by giving
himsalf up to them, and the accom
panying bondsmen explained that
they wished to surrender him. It was
evident that the plan was to sue out
a writ of habeas corpus and prevent
the hearing in the Police Court that
had been set for 2 o'clock.
In the petition presented to the Fed
eral Court the contention was made
that the primary law of California is in
violation of the constitution of the Unit
ed States, in that it discriminates be
tween political parties. It provides that
a party must cast at least 3 per cent
of the total vote of the previous elec
tion to gain a place on the official
ballot, and in many communities would
shut out. for example, the Prohibition
party, which is a national entity.
Therefore, the law being unconstitu
tional, there was no law for Wyman to
violate. Countryman urged.
But Judge de Haven declared it to
be wey established that Federal Courts
shall not interfere with the laws and
courts of a State until the avenues of
remedy of the State shall have been
exhausted. In his opinion there were
no exceptional facts presented and
therefore no ground to justify interfer
ence on hjs part.
WILL. RESORT TO APPEALS.
Attorney Countryman explained that
he would appeal to .the United States
Supreme Court from the decision' of
Judge de Haven if he did not lose the
right because he was not present when
the decision was rendered. If barred
because not on hand to give notice, he
said, a second petition would be suea
out before Circuit Judge Morrow ana
the appeal taken from his court, if his
decision be adverse.
By carrying the case to Washington
it is hoped to have the prosecution in
the State courts stayed until a ruling
shall be obtained there.
Countryman says he may seek a
writ of habeas corpus in the Superior
Court, and if unsuccessful in gaining
the release of his client, appeal to the
State Supreme Court.
John A. Hosmer appeared for the
Merchants' Association as special pros
ecutor. He was accompanied by George
T. Wright, counsel for the organiza
tion Fairfax H. Wheelan, the com
plaining witness, was in attendance,
and with him was Frank J. Symmes,
president of the Merchants* Associa
tion.
Judge Cabaniss first called Wyman
to the stand to inquire whether he was
in. court throughout the arraignment
proceedings, at the time the sensation
al discovery was made that a "double"
of the defendant was to all intents and
purposes taking his place. The pris
oner said he was in the courtroom from
the time of convening to adjournment,
and Judge Cabaiiiss made no further
investigation.
RINGER IS IDENTIFIED.
The man in the City Prison sus
pected oi being a pickpocket and giv
ing the name of John McNamara has
been positively identified as the court
room "ringer." When asked if he had
been requested or induced to appear in
the Police Court for the purpose of
confusing the witnesses for the prose
cution. McNamara, alias McMenomy,
refused to say, neither affirming nor
denying. "At the proper time, which
is in, court, I will talk, but not till
then," he declared.
The testimony taken before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday was the identifi
cation of a.iidavits of registration
showing the signature of the defendant
and of that of S. H. Mann, whose
name he is, alleged to have voted. The
roster, which is in the hands of the
Grand Jury and contains the forgery
of Mann's name, was also produced.
While the roster of the Seventy-third
precinct was in court Judge Cabaniss
allowed representatives of the Mer
chants' Association ,to photograph it.
Registrar Adams was present and pro
tested, but when asked to give a valid
reason for his objection could not do
bo to the satisfaction of the court.
Judge Cabaniss, when asked, fixed
Wyman's new bail bond at $1000 cash
and the money was furnished by Pub
lic Works Commissioner F. A. Maes
tretti.

What do you chance
when you buy a
Piano?
WHEN YOU BUY A PIANO all you see is
the case, all you hear is the tone in the ware-
rooms and the delightful music of the salesman's
argument â the rest you take on chance.-
You can't tell how long that tone will last; you
can't see ahead three years and know by the test of
time that your instrument will prove the worth the
salesman claims for it, and you can't tell whether
you're paying a hundred dollars too much or not.
You HAVE to trust the dealer.
So go to a piano concern you KNOW will treat
you fairly; to a concern, with a reputation for honor-
able dealing and with but one price to everybody.
