PARIS, May B.â A curious reversal of
the incident known as the siege of Fort
Chabrol is reported in dispatches from
Limoges, where, at his leather works,
the private house of M. Beaulleu is be
eieged by workmen on strike, to pre
vent tradesmen from taking provisions
Into the dwelling. â¢
Beaulicu has telephoned to Mayor
Lebussiere that he and nine persons,
\u25a0with three horses, are suffering from
hunger. Beaulieu refused to parley
with the strikers until their hunger
was satisfied, whereupon policemen
were dispatched by the Mayor to the
nearest restaurant for provisions. On
his return the besiegers, whose num- (
bers had increased, made a show of
preventing them from entering the
house. Mayor Labussiere expostulated,
stating there were persons in the house
â¢who had not eaten for twenty-four
hours.
"What care we." replied the strikers
"Our children have not had a square
m*aJ for two months. Why should any
difference be made in the case of an
*\u25a0 The Mayor continued Wb entreaties,
elating that bread would be distributed
at the City Hall, but the excited strik
ers stood their ground.
Taking up two loaves, the Mayor
shouted to the citizens to let them have
at least one." â¢
"Only one, one only!" replied the
mob.
"This is cruel and barbarous," cried
the Mayor- ""You do not deserve as
eistance. I have been supporting your
Interests, but now I shall resign. You
will have to take the consequences."
In spite of this appeal, the strikers
refused to allow more than one loaf to
be given, to the ten persons in the
house. .
Subsequently Beaulieu agreed to a
conference with a deputation, but no
decision has yet been arrived at. His
xrife and children are still suffering the
pangs of hunger.
CALL. BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, May B.â Pope , Pius'
last* encyclical letter to all prelates
and others in the Roman Catholic,
communion is considered the broadest
and most far-reaching document he
has written since his elevation. The
encyclical has just come to the aposto
lic delegation in Latin form and will
be translated soon and sent through
out the country.
According to the "prelates the ency
clical is especially important,- since it
speaks authoritatively ; upon subjects
which are now harassing the Ameri
can secular as .well as relisious world.
He speaks 'in positive 'terms on the
vital importance of moral teachings
for young, and old, 1 and of the influ
ence of religious instruction on the na
tion, as well as they individual. He
makes a general' review^ of the deplor
able condition |of the world Sat the
present time and; suggests the.,
remedy lies in knowing more;! clearly
and following more" closely. the",teach
ings of Christianity. ; ; â¢ ;'* \u25a0 'j: -'\u25a0 ;'l >\u25a0":

the church - authorities,'^ is timely^ in

[ } "There are to-day vast numbers, !
continually being recruited ? by, fresh
accessions, who are utterly ignorant of
truths of religion. or who at most pos- '\u25a0'\u25a0
sess only such knowledge of God- and
of Christian facts asj to. lead the lives
of. isolators. In consequence of this
ignorance they regard it as no 'crime
to . cherish hatred against their : neigh
bors, to; enter into most'unjust-con
tracts,' most unjust speculation, en
deavor to possess 'themselves: of .prop
erty .of others by enormous usury and
lo commit ! other iniquities, 'not less
'reprehensible.
VFurthermore, they seem unaware
that the- law of Christ not only forbids
immoral actions, but' condemns im
moral thoughts and immoral desires.
Even when they are restrained from
abandoning themselves \u25a0Â» to sensual
pleasures, ;they,: without any scruples,
feed themselves on evil thoughts, mul
tiplying sins beyond the hairs of Â«the
head. We deem it necessary; to re
peat that ! such persons g are f ound ; not
only among the poorer classes," but; in
the highest walks of "life,, and even
among those puffed *up with knowl
edge, who relying upon vain erudition,
think they are at liberty to turn relig
ion into ridicule." /
The preaching-of; "topical" sermons
among the Catholic, clergy receives, a
severe arraignment, and, the. writing of
controversial books 'and of learned
treatises is nbt'encouraged. . :
"Too often," says the Pope, "it hap
pens that ornate sermons which, v^in
the applause of crowded congregations
serve only to. tickle the ear and fail
utterly to touch^the heart." Ov -

NEW YORK. May B.â Former Pres
ident Grover Cleveland's name was
mentioned to-day when twenty-three
members of the board of directors of
the Equitable Assurance Society gath
ered in an "informal conference" to
discuss the affairs of the society. Mr.
Cleveland waa pointed out as the type
of man who must ultimately be called
to take the helm of the society.
It was Melville E. Ingalls. a member
of the Frick investigation committee,
who suggested Mr. Cleveland, as the
manner of man ww T ho must succeed to
power when James W. Alexander,
Gage E: Tarbell . and â¢ even James H.
Hyde have been placed in the back
ground and the "Equitable's affairs
have been smoothed . out."
It was decided that it would be un
wise for the adoption of any resolu
tion before the report of the investi
gating committee.. The only affirma
tive action . taken was that the board
should be called together not later than
the 31st. of the month.- .
The statement is made that no de
mand was made at the,conference'to
day for the retJfernehTreither *of~Ffes-"
ident Alexander or . Vice , President
Hyde, -although, the names "of several
men of distinction were mentioned in
connection with j the presidency.

ing statement:
To the policy holders of. the Equitable LlfÂ«
Assurance Society of the United States:

Inquiries concerning the controversy now pend

LONDON, May 9.â The. editorial arti

flect a, lively anxiety as to the outcome
to the delicate. situation involved in the j
dispute between Japan and France on

ance is . made for : the . difficulty . France

most to observe neutrality, according
to her interpretation. - Whether 'the

accordingly.- \u25a0 r . > . .â. .
. The London newspapers do ; not con

waters constitute a serious i menace Ho
Japan's ability to ' retain ; command lof
the sea. and, although:- it i is not;appre
hended thatl Japan will force the sit

others powers. Intdtthe "struggle, since
"euch developments I would r suit - Russia's
plans,; strong appeals will ' be made ; to
the French Government to -avoid , the
possibility "of such .complications. . -

OAKLAND. May B.â Haunted by
a morbid fear that his \u2666 reason
was being shattered, B. C. Cuvel
lier. vice ' president of the A.
YsgriiÂ»r Company, importers of San
Francisco at 429 Battery street, and a
former City Councilman of Oakland,
blew out his brains to-day ..by
shooting himself in the head with a
pistol on the promenade roof of the
.Union Savings Bank, Thirteenth street
and Broadway.
Overwrought by hard work, v de
spair over the death a year ago of his
wife and depressed under a severe
strain of nervous collapse, the de
spondent man sought suicide.
It *\as thus that his own father
many years ago ended his existence in
Xew Orleans, where he had been a
prominent attorney. The father shot
himself by putting the muzzle of a
pistol in his mouth. The son did
identically the same thing to-day.
Father and son were the same ace,
51 years, when the end came to each.

LOSES MIND
"To or three days ago I took away
from Cuvellier- the pistol with which
he killed himself. He was ; very de
spondent and had threatened to kill
himself, but I got him into a better,
frame of mind.V He ' agreed to ; go ?to i a
hospital for a f ew/days until ; he should
feel in shape to gb-East. , He -required
a long rest and I believe it would have
restored him to normal health." I drove
part; way up town this "morning with
him and left. supposing he was going
to San Francisco.".' 'â¢;;â¢>;
Last Friday Cuvellier met P. W. Bel
lingall, an old friend, saying:: \u0084: - \u25a0
"Pete, if anything,, happens I to . me,;
look out for my. children."
Great sumrise was :-,,â¢ occasioned
among the former business { associates
of * Mr. ; Cuvellier, in this; city byi the
news that - hejhad committed" suicide;
Cuvellier had been connected/with fAT
Vlgnier In; business on Battery; street,"
being vice presjdent â of : the's company
of which s Mr. Vignier is the head, j Mr/
Vignier said f yesterday, that ihe I knew
of no: reason why Cuvellier :* should
have committed, suicide. ; : He-AhadSnd
financial* troubles.' * Back i of : his .' con :
Cuvellier was born in New Orleans of
one of the- old French families " of ; the
Mississippi metropolis:. 'He â¢; came to
California in his younger days, and
early entered the employ of James de
Fremery & Co., the '; pioneer importing
house of San Francisco.' Af terimany^
years of service there Cuvellier sev-:
ered his connections and (was associat
ed with the A; Vlgnier Company. . In
the business world: he occupied a high
position and was L esteemed for his
probity and charming personality." Hi 3
business associates were shocked by
the news of his : tragic death. '.; They,
said he had been ill for several months
and was a sufferer from nervous trou
bles. . :/._: -, ; \u0084\ -; .' .;:;; ;;
Cuvellier had talked of suicide to his
friends, but they did not take his
threats seriously. Dr. Rinehart in this
connection said: â¢, - - v
From Neil McCracken, a clerk at
J. P. Maxwell's hardware store, Four
teenth and Washington streets. Cuvel
lier bought cartridges for his pistol
this morning while -on his way to the
place of death. - " .
It was a year ago that the former
Councilman showed signs of mental de
pression. His wife some months before
that had sustained a severe injury by
a fall. Her death followed and the be
reft husband was prostrated. But he
appeared to rally, and later he re
sumed, outwardly, ; his accustomed ; vi
vacity and keen' interest in his business
and political - affairs. He had served
four terms in the City Council and was
to be a -candidate for re-election when
unexpectedly he announced his with
drawal from politics.
Several months ago he began to com
plain of ill health. He suffered from
sleeplessness and went to St. Helena
for treatment. Among his intimates
he confided his physical troubles. Re
cent treatment seemed to have bene
fited the sufferer. He'so expressed him
self, but the shadow of melancholia
was upon him.
â¢ FROM OM) FAMBbY. :
Following: the finding of the letter
came the story of Dr. J. F. Rinehart,
at whose residence, Eighth and Ade
line streets, Cuvellier had been stay
ing for a week under treatment for
extreme nervous collapse.
He left the physician's home this
morning after breakfast, osten
sibly to go to San Francisco to make
arrangements for a trip to Chicago,
where he had been invited by his
cousin. Julius Kruttschnitt, the South
ern Pacific Company official, to spend
some time in recuperation of his
health. i;\. â¢ .
Cuvellier's body, with the -pistol
near by, was found at noon to-day
by a party of sightseers, who had
gone to the observation roof, a fa
vorite viewDoint of the city. They
rushed back to give the alarm and
notified John Bernhard, the elevator
man, who summoned the police. Dr.
Carl E. Curdts also responded. He
examined the corpse | and' found that
the bullet had passed through the
roof of the mouth into the brain.
Deputy Coroner Van Vranken re
moved the body to the Morgue.
An hour before the body was seen
Cuvellier rode up in the elevator with
B. H. Griffins and A. P. Leach, attar
no's, with whom he passed the time
of day. Cuvellier seemed cheerful. He
Inquired the way to the roof and re
paired there, remarking on the splen
did view of the city that one could
gain from that height, . :. ;y.
The first clew to the possible cause
of the suicide was obtained from a
letter, found among Cuvellier's effects.
The - message was one of cheer from
George -R. Close, written at the St.
Helena Sanitarium, where Cuvellier
had been a patient several weeks ago.
Close urged, his friend to be hopeful,
and its tone indicated that Cuvellier
had been despondent because of his
ill health.
DOCTOR'S STORY.
J. D. Blrdsall, who has been cashier
and manager for the Oakland branch

ness, is missing, together with about
$7000 of his employer's money. ,-\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 '\u25a0;-..
.A warrant for Birdsall's . arrest 'was
issued last night by Police Judge Smith
of Oakland. The v alleged | defaulter is
believed to have been playing the races.
When the season closed last Saturday,
it is said, he found himself short, in his
accounts and desired to flee the State.
L. C. Sheldon, whose office in this city
Is in room 304, Merchants" Exchange
building, maintained a large branch at
the corner of Second and ; Market
streets in Oakland and nearly three
years ago Birdsall was placed in charge
there. There was never any suspicion
"bf his dishonesty; until last Saturday,
when he failed to appear at ; the office.
An examination was at once \ made \ of
his accounts, and while the exact
amount of the shortage is not known
it will be about $7000. / ; :
Birdsall's' home Is at 1720 San An
tonio avenue, Alameda. He has a wife
but no children.

DOAN'S PILLS.
Hot It Was Made mi Retained in
San Francisco.
A good reputation is not easily
earned, and it was only by hard, con-
sistent work among our citizens that
Doan's Kidney Pills won their way
to the proud distinction attained in
this locality. The public indorsement
of scores of San Francisco residents
has rendered invaluable service to the
community. Read what this citizen
says:
F. T. Collins, silk hatter, of ioio^j
Hyde street, says: "It is a difficult
. matter to give greater praise to
Doan's Kidney Pills than their' re-
markable properties deserve. For
several years I was bothered more or
less with kidney complaint, particu-
larly if I contracted a cold, which
was sure to seat itself in the region
of my back just over the kidneys. I
fooled around for a long time trying
medicines of various kinds, none of
which even., helped, and finally Mrs.
Coliins. who had been reading con-
siderable about Doan's Kidney Pills,
advised me to take a course of the
treatment. If the first box had not
brought results I can positively guar-
antee this, I never would have bought
a second; and if the second had not
stopped the last attack â and, what is
better, there has not been a symptom
of a recurrence for six monthsâ l
could .not be induced under any cir-
cumstances to publicly recommend
the preparation."

Special Dispatch to The CalL
The question was the same in each,
case and involved efforts to enjoin the
private establishments from the use of
the board's quotations. Both concerns
resented the use of the designation of
"bucket shop," and It was charged that
the transactions; of the board are
themselves of a nature to justify the
Characterization of the board as a
â¢"bucket shop," a majority of them in
volving no physical transfer of the
property supposed to be transferred. â¢
Summing up the points involved,
Ju&tice Holmes, in delivering the opin
ion of the court, said that the board
supplies its quotations to the telegraph,
companies under a contract not to de
liver them to "bucket shops," and said'
the cases were instituted to prevent
the use of the figures by private houses
â¢without contracts with the Board of
Trade. He added that a majority of
the court was not prepared to say that
the transactions of the board consti
tute gambling and the decision was
that the injunction should be granted
as prayed for. Justices Harlan, Brewer
and Day dissented.
In his opinion Justice Holmes charac
terized the board as "a great market
where, through its ISOO members. Is
transacted a large part of the grain
and provision business of the world."
Speaking of the dealing in futures, he
paid: "People will endeavor to forecast
the future and to make agreements
according to their prophecy. Specula
tion of this kind by competent men is
the self-adjustment of society to the
probable. Its value is well known as
a means of avoiding or mitigating
cases, equalizing prices and providing
for periods of want. When the Chi
cago Board was organized we cannot
doubt that it was expected to afford a
market for future, as well as present
sales, with the necessary incidents of
such a market, and while the State of
Illinois allows the charter to stand we
cannot believe that the 'pits,' merely as
places where future sales are made, are
forbidden by law."

MOVEMENTS OP; FREIGHT.
A matter of great commercial im
portance to the. Pacific. Coast is dis
cussed in a report that; has been.pre
pared for the information of Presi
dent Roosevelt, \ Secretary. Talt of the
War; Department and; J. L.- Bristow, a
special Commissioner ; appointed by
President Roosevelt to visit thls'xoast
and acquire facts. The question^ refers
to the utility of the Panama route for
the movement of freight between San
Francisco and the Atlantic States.
â¢ The report was submitted by ; W. R.
Wheeler, W.-JT. Dutton andÃufus P.
Jennings. -It was adopted by the.trus
teesof the Chamber of Commerce. and .
yesterday was forwarded to j
ton In printed form by the Chamber. J
<Tse finds , that "there is ;
really but one object to -be, attained, J
and -\u25a0 that is the adoption *of i such \u25a0a I
course as will make the Panama route j
more" advantageous' for the movement -.
of freight than under the , conditions
heretofore existing." ". -The committee
also gives it as an opinions-indorsed by
the Chamber of Commerce, that* "a
carefnl consideration of all the data
obtainable -brings .the subject down to
the pomt 1 of determining what is the
most practical \u25a0 and at the same time
most; beneficial course that wilK pro
mote the commercial interest of San
Franci6co and; the Pacific Coast in the
year's to come,' with reference to
freight traffic via the Isthmua of Pan
ama.":
It is set forth that in reaching a sat
isfactory conclusion there are certain
elements of fact that must be borne in
mind.
These considerations, with some rec
ommendations, are given as follows in
the words of the committee.
MANY COXSIDERATIOXS.
First â The present freight ' schedule via
Panama la apparently based on the overland
railroad freight schedule, the charges of the
: former, varying from 78, percent to 80 per cent.
1 with an everasre of about 63 per cent of the
latter: !n other words, thÂ« differentials in favor
of the Panama route with Its thirty-day trip
as compared with the transcontinental route
with Its fourteen-day trip are bo small that the
shipper either east or west does not consider
the saving sufficient to cover risk of damage or
breakage In the necessary several handlings of
the goods via Panama.
Second â A regular schedule of nailing dates
wouM seem to be a necessity.' This would
! enable ehlppers to order definite quantities per
steamer without straining: their storage facili
ties at New York or other Eastern centers. If
an open- service were established,, giving as
satisfactory, sailing dates as has the, . Pacific
Mail Company's eervice and doing the business
on a lower basis of freight rates, it would
prove a very desirable arrangement, * and the
traffic via Panama would be greatly enlarged.
Thirdâ The ability 'to transport freight via
Panama does not rest with the steamers alone.
Numerous steamships with large carrying ca
pacity can be readily obtained, but the quan
tity of tonnage will be measured by the ability
of the Panama railroad to handle it. That
company has already a very large business to
handle with South America, west coast of
Central America, Mexico and' California, and
itg facilities -should be enlarged to meet the
increasing traffic over this road. There have
been | frequent instances in recent years when
there has been a great freight congestion on
the isthmus. Now there is a new question
of Importance â the building " of the Panama
Canal. This work will require at least ten
years, awl with the enormous quantities of
machinery, supplies for labor and material of
construction will not the Government business
be so voluminous that, with present facilities,
the ability of the railroad to handle this ton
nage and the through freight be | largely dim
inished? Should the present line be double
tracked it would rtlll be a. '- question as " to
whether the additional facilities would admit
of much increase In general freights, aside
f ram . the requirements occasioned by canal
construction. \u25a0 â-
Fourthâ lt is generally conceded that a line
of steamers plying between San Francisco and
Panama Ms a , commercial necessity. In this
connection merchants favor a service with a
regular schedule to one without schedule. Such
schedule l.v warranted by trade requirements,
and should be maintained by one or more
comwmie*. with a. fixed tariff based upon a
fair revenue, which would provide more equit
able rate* on freight. Regular established
rates would doubtless better serve the ' com
mercial Interacts of San Francisco than open
competition in rates which might fluctuate to
a degree that would be disastrous.,- .
Flfth-Otf "It can be accomplished without
vlolatfen of treaty obligations none of "the
Mexican end Central American tonnage now
carried by American vessels should be al
lowed to go to foreign : vessels, as it would
leave the American line -with oily New York
and San Francisco through business to live on.
Receiptg from way freights increase; the earn
ings of thf company and help to reduce the
cost of. New, York and California business.
ir the way traffic were \u25a0 surrendered "to foreign
j lines It wo*Jld Increase the cdat of the United
i States-interstate business and Impair : a ser-
I rice . which . fifty years of active ; operation has
demonstrated' should be improved. '
- Sixth â The canal la - now- being - built - by
American enterprise ' and . American steamships
should control the traffic of the Isthmus until
the day America ': opens 7 the portals the
Panama, canal to our â¢ country's new merchant
marine and the commerce' of 'the" world. We
are strongly opposed to Government ownership 1
or operation of steamship lines for commercial
purpose*, and we. recommend the '.national
Government :. adopting such; measures as will
f OÃter : the establishment ;. and ' : main tenance iof
regular Hires of American steamships operated
by private American enterprise. .

Teddy Webb has found a part as Ko
Ko in the "Mikado" that fits him to
a nicety and he fills, the role more
cleverly than it has ever been done
before in San -Francisco. The "Mika
do" was put on for the first time dur
ing the present revival at the Tivoli
last evening. It was characterized by
a large chorus of pretty girls, fully
two dozen of them: by an abundance
of good clothes, by excellent singing
on the part of chorus and principals
alike and by staging that was elabo
rate and entirely adequate. But while
Willard Simms was funny in what he
had to do, Teddy Webb was the star
of the evening. His stage business
was droll in the extreme. The custo
mary lines were pieced out with local
'â¢gags" and took in all sorts- of con
ditions, including the troubles at the
City Hall. The new> business won
plaudits in great shape. Teddy had
to sing the "Tit Willow" song half a
dozen times.
While Teddy shone as Ko Ko,
Schuster did an act worth talking
about as Pooh Bah. Algernon Asp
land was to have been the lover, Xan
ki Poo, but. Arthur Mesraer took the
role- and made a very good success
with It.- He had considerable applause
.in solos and : his voice, was in good
trim to do justice to the music. Fog
arty's voice was also heard to fine ad
vantage as Pish Tush.
Dora de Fillippe was an arch Yum
Yum. The two other "little maids
from school" were Grace Palotta and
Myrle Bunn. Palotta^ especially cap
tured favor. Her good looks, : fetch-
Ing costume and sweet voice helped
her to create a decidedly favorable
'Impression. Bessie Tannehill's sing
ing brought her a recall, and the com
pliment was justly given.
Take the performance and the gen
eral average of it was very high. The
audience warmed up to the music and
the- cleverness of the people by the
middle of the first act and the old
time enthusiasm of the Tivoli audience
came back with vigorous manifesta
tions at all favorable opportunities for
expression of it. Paul Steindorff
wielded, the baton, and Ferris Hart
man managed the stage.' ,

TEDDY WEBB, THE POPULAR
TIVOL.I COMEDIAN, AS KOKO
IN "THE MIKADO."
â¢ Am m. young rose hung with morn
lr.g dew, kin to all youth, spring and
loveliness, Is Julia Marlowe's Juliet.
Last night after nine years, Miss Mar
lowe gave again in San Francisco what
has perhaps been rightly held her
most notable characterization- Mr. E.
[H. Sothern made bis . debut here . as
Romeo. Mr. Charles Frohman ''pre
sented a surrounding production of
â¢ most* admirable sort. A good house,
though uncrowded, saw the play.
Perhaps it is the fault of Ben Greet,
â¢ who In unsophistlcating us in the mat
ter of Shakespeare without scenery has
lent us the more exacting sophistica
tion of simplicity. But one would fain
have seen last night's cast play "Ro
meo and Juliet" in the Elizabethan
fashion â this, too, without any ingrati
tude for Mr. Frohman's truly splendid
settings. Fifteen scenes in flve acts is
a. rather tremendous lot of pictures to
take in with one play.
One finds the constant change dis
tracting. One finds It difficult to hang \
|on to the rhythm of the thing. One be
grins to question, then to remember
that Shakespeare wrote for the cur
tainless stage. Then, when one gets
the scene in Juliet's bedchamber, a :
â¢ magnificent picture, one is again grate- j
ful for the Shakespeare according to
Frohman. Perhaps, though, the stag
ing is of a fashion with the sweet in- '
credibleness of the play! Perhaps as
picture after picture, verse after verse.
It comes convincingly enough as, what
it Is, one of the world-poems. ,
That is what the play became with
every moment that Miss Marlowe
brought to it. So with much that Mr.
Sothern had to give. Miss Marlowe
seems just old enough to know ex
quisitely how to be young. For her
cheer beauty as a picture one must see
her to get any adequate idea. Per
fectly the illusion of young girlhood,
to the very whiteness of the voice, is
obtained. Most happily her first
scenes are keyed. There is the gay,
care-free, almost frolic humor that
forms such needful and beautiful foil
to the gravity of the later scenes. It
is with this gayety that Miss Marlowe
carries one through Juliet's swift fall
ing a-love. Shakespeare asks much
here of his lovers, what you and I
would give them half a play at. Yet
Miss Marlowe, with Mr. Sothern, vic
toriously creates the illusion.
The balcany scene was nothing
short of adorable. A witching, blos
somy creature, all innocence, all love,
was Miss Marlowe's Juliet here. She
was of a part with the moonlight, with
the nightingale's song, with the roses
climbing to her window. Yet most
sweetly she suggested the good sense
of the maid, who asks if the lover
means honorably to wed her. Her
coquetry is delicious, her womanliness
all charming:. The scene with the
nurse, as she brings the news of
Itomeo's arrangements for the wed
ding, with its coaxing, teasing, beguil
lns, "was another most delicate hit of
artistry.
Then when the deeper notes came to
be sounded was equal truth, equal
charm. The growth of the' character
\u25a0was suggested with eloquent convic
tion. Juliet in her bedchamber, taking
the sleeping draught, bidding farewell
to her mother, her nurse, was all wo
man, tender with woman's tenderness,
Impassioned with woman's passion.
But lovely as the tears that wet Miss
Marlowe's cheek here is the restraint,
the quiet keying of the tragedy
throughout. Sorrowful only, not pain
ful, it is, and entirely exquisite.
Mr. Sothern, a little somber In the
opening scenes even for. a gentleman
sick of lo\-e for a cold beauty, later
becomes spirited and youthful. He is
poetic and effective in the balcony
Â«cene, and in the duel scene a most
dashing hero. One cannot imagine a
Frank Spreyne, the* undertaker : who
buried ; Mrs. Walcker-Hoch;> testified
that the embalming fluid contained : no
arsenic. Spreyne's testimony is {cor
roborated by the results of an analysis
of -the fluid. J. M: Schlelsser, :; employ r
edas clerk in a drug/store at : Sixty
third and Halsted streets;- testified
that he had frequently sold various
prescriptions to; her. .He identified /a
number of them. In his direct testi-.
monyiSchieisser declared that none of
them contained arsenic. : In his cross
examination, however, he said that one
of the prescriptions did containa smalF
quantity of arsenic. * A sharp tilt be-f
tween counsel preceded the testimony
of Mrs. Fischer-Hoch,' but Judge Kers
ten overruled objections of the . de
fense. After identifying a bank book
that she had used and saying that
Hoch had asked her to withdraw her
money from the bank and turn the
proceeds over to him to pay for his
house, Mrs. Fiecher-Hoch told of go
ing to her home with Hoch. When
they got to the house they were met,
at the door by Mrs. Sauerborck, who
said: "Don't go in there, Mrs.! Hoch.'
Mrs. Sohn is here and -she says that
Hoch murdered your sister." -,\ ',
Mrs. Fischer occupied the witness
chair the entire afternoon. , She told
in detail the flirtations carried on by.
Hoch with her while Mrs. Walcker-
Hoch lay dying.
"I reminded him that my sister was
not yet burled and that it was no time
for him to talk to me in that manner.
He declared that the dead was for the
dead and the living for the living, and.
that his talking to. me at that time did
not: make any difference." '
Mrs. Fischer concluded her testimony,
by stating that ; she had seen . Hoch
giving her sister a light colored pow
der in some water two days before her
death. Mrs. Fischer will be on ,the
stand again to-morrow.

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
OAKLAND, May S.â Pinned under
& house which he was moving and
which had slipped from the timbers
supporting it, Joseph M. McCrea, a
housemover by occupation and resid
ing at 321 Twenty-fourth street, met
a horrible death to-day at Haywards.
He was caught directly under the
center of the house, whither he had
crawled to replace one of the support
ing timbers. He was terribly crushed,
his neck, back and both legs being
broken.
McCrea was moving a dwelling from
Castro to B street, in Haywards. and
after some distance had been traversed
some of the supporting timbers slipped
and the house began to settle. While
McCrea was under the structure to
replace the timbers it suddenly settled
nearly a foot, giving the housemover
no time to escape. When workmen
finally released the body it was found
that McCrea had been crushed from
head to foot.
The body was removed to the branch
morgue, at Hay wards, where an In
quest will be held.
McCrea was 50 years of age 'and
leaves a widow and five children. No
arrangements have as yet been made
for the funeral. ,

GOPCEVIC WINS
INITIAL POINT
BERKELEY. May B.â The execu
tive committee: of the Associated Stu
dents has undertaken the control of
all social, dramatic,, fraternity and
musical entertainments to be given
by the student body of the ; University
of California. This action was taken
at a meeting to-night, when resolu
tions were adopted declaring that the
indiscriminate giving of many differ
ent functions or "activities or college
life" often resulted in the "detriment
of college life." , \
The resolutions then appealed to
President Wheeler, asking that the
control of such functions be vested
either in the president of the univer
sity or the executive committee of the
Associated Students and that no such
entÂ«rtainments or functions be al
lowed without permission being asked
for and obtained from either" the pres
ident â¢ of .- the university or the execu
tive committee .that, initiated this
move. 'â¢" â¢ " '
Then followed srlist of "activities of
college life" that are to be subject to
such control, the list including every
thing that is in any way connected
with the student body of the univer
sity, even to the class affairs,', frater
nity affairs and : everything that car
ries the name of the. University of Cal
ifornia or is participated in by the
students. President Wheeler has . re
ferred the question back to the exec
utive committee and has told them
that he has no objection to their as
suming such control.
This is a revolutionary move and of
so sweeping a character that, it will
create discussion. It was ' taken by
the regular representatives of the stu
dent body, but it is certain , that ' but
few of the students -knew what was
being-done. If the executive commit
tee stands' by Its action nothing can
be given by the undergraduates or: in
the name of the university except that
application be first made to the exec
utive committee and permission be
granted by them. . ' This move was
caused by the fact that there has been
a growing tendency toward class and
fraternity social events, and that there
have been occasional charges of pro
fessionalism connected, with some of
the college societies.
President Decides
That Scheme
Is Good.

though large sums are ; being spent in
other States and Territories, most of
which have contributed but small
amounts toward the general fund, the

give his decision on .Wednesday.;,- The
attorneys for the : defense have peti
tioned for a partial distribution of the

docile since his sentence, broke /out
again last night. Jailer Fulton was
called from his bed by continued and
loud rappings on Weber's cell door, and
on investigating found Weber hammer-
Ing with a broom handle. Weber said
Under Sheriff May had opened a win
dow In his portion of the < Jail and he
wanted it closed. When Fulton told
him the window , would have to remain
as â¢it was Weber flew \u25a0 into a terrible
passion and cried, 'Til kill you, . Ful
ton." The Jailer was not to be bluffed,
however, and took the , broomstick and

MR: PETER C. ANDERSON.
"My home doctors In Pelaluma gave up
my case and cent me to San FrandiÂ»co. to un-
<JÂ»Â»rFo a surgical operation for a bleeding tumor
of the blaxidcr. 1 was about dead, but as I
thought there wÂ»s only. one chance and that
â¢ws* through sunrery, I < took my physician's
e>l\lce *nd nacked my clothes and went to
fine of the leading hospitals of San " Francisco
rreparÂ«*d to Uike my chances upon the operat-
ing table. After the consultation of the Â«ur-
Reons m the hospital, tnÂ»>y told mjr ulfe that
1 had only one chance In a hundred to live
through thÂ« operation. That seemed to us no I
chance at all and before taking euch a great
risk, my wife and I decided that we would
jelve the Electro-Ohemlc treatment a trial be-
fore undergoing the operation. W* frit that
it would strengthen me anyway and vut me
In a condition to undeixo the operation latÂ«r
if It proved absolutely necessary. I grew
stronger under the Electro-Chemic treatment
from the beginning and I am very glad indeed
to cay that this wonderful new treatment cured
me perfectly and made surgical treatment un-
necessary- I had lost so much - blood anj I
was co near dead that I feel that the r hock
of surgical treatment would have finished me,
and to â¢ think that I have be-n thoroughly
cured at a until - expense with absolutely no
pain r&akea me feel grateful to the physicians
of thÂ» Electro-Chemtc Institute. It seems
strange that my wife should also be attacked
toy what my home physicians pronounced an
Incurable trouble except through a nurKical
operation. We considered the matter care-
fully Â«nd we decided that before undertaking
surgical treatment, we would see what Elec-
tro-Chem!stry would do for my wife and i>he
is now In ' San Francisco undergoing treatment
at. the Electro-Chemic . Institute at lIS Grant
avenue. I am glad to tsay that my wife Is
improving steadily and I have every reason to
believ* that Eleetre-Chemlstry will make a
. srurglcal '-operation in her case- also unneces-
sary. I -am sure that my wife would be glad
Â«o have any one call upon her that might be
Interested in her treatment and my cure by
KlectiD-CbemHtry. My home is .Â«t Peuns !
Grove, clx miles outside of Petaluma. aad
any one may ' call upon me . or write me re- '
yarding my cure and the present - treatment
of my wife by the Etectro-Cbemlc Specialists.

IT is reported that the proceedings of the Senate Committee which
is investigating railroad . legislation make it certain that no rate
..... bill can pass the Senate and that that body; will .' thwart the Presi
dent. It is difficult to understand how^ so large a generalization can
be drawn out of the proceedings of one committee.
The country very generally accepted the President's recom
mendations as wise and necessary last December. If they were so
then, they will be no less wise and necessary nextiDecembeiv The
Senate should not be diverted from its' certainty of what is right by
any consequences that are to come in the future. Butjf it cannot
offer reasons for its course that commend themselves to the-com
mon sense and sense of justice in the people, it is playing with fire
by opposing the President, whose views are accepted b}' the coun
try as wise "and right. It will not do merely to oppose him
the Senate has the power to make effective opposition: It must
show the people that it is right and he is wrong. This it must do
if it persist in opposition. If it fail to make, that ''demonstration the
question will go to the people in 1906 in the election of the -next
House, and there is a chance for a result so radical that' the Presi
dent's constitutional and conservative policy will be lost to the
country, and the nation will be urged to embark in a radicalism that
will mean an acute change in the whole direction and purpose of
the Government. It will mean that the Government decides to quit
governing and will go into business, and all that such course im
plies. , ....
If that come the Senate will have caused it.. If that body get
its undoing in such a revolution- it can thank only itself. We believe,
however, that the Senate will see the situation and accommodate
itself to it, and d^ttherrailroads'of ;thc-rcOTntfy:-wHValso^see^tliat;
their proper course lies in accepting the President's conservative
oolicv ratlier than taking by compulsion the radicalism- that is ready
to break loose. J i '

TT LMOST # everybody who ; has had r
A-Atips and downs in* her 'wardrob^
'\u25a0'.. 'has noticed that she is likely '] to
have a great' deal more attention. from
clerks and others wheti* she ' is , looking
her best, so far as clothesiareicon
cerned, than when she is looking her
worst If she has ever used a car
riageânot necessarily hers.';: but any
good looking and prosperous carriage
i â -she has also observed \u25a0 that . the ; car
riage will make up for deficiencies in
wardrobe when its presence cfin' be
i noted, and that , she never gHtsgSuJte
! as much attention as when it:is pre
sumed, that she has a carriage to ride
in, ho matter how well sUe Us dressed.
It is not entiTely creditable to our
American , ideas "of equality and dem
ocracy that this should be so. It sim
ply is soâ that's allâ arid it has to be
taken into account w^th .-other imper
fections of human nature.
! \ Mrs. Alexander ' Holden Uos t. her. par
ents arid I went in^^di^p^mottrnlo^
She did what ,jis usually done in the
! circumstances- when Â«it is possible ; to
! afford itâ she save all her colored
frocks to friends, so that they could
get the use and benefit of them. . . -â¢'â¢
About the .same time Mr. Holden
acquired, a large interest In a mine, in
Mexico that had the utmost promise. :
He was a mining engineer and -had in
spected the property himself,, so that
he had none; of the customary mis
givings. He had already' acquired a
fortune and expected to do no more
work on the. strength of such invest
ments as 'he had ; already >made; but
there. is something in mining. that gets
,into the blood, , and he could not re
sist so good a chance. /
Mrs. Holden grieved so; at her loss
that the. management, of the new
mine,' not proving either satisfactory
or profitable, Mr. Holden determined
to give the property his personal at
tention and to remove' his^ wife from
the scenes" of her great 'deprivation by
taking her with him into the wilds of
Mexico.' had roughed it with" him
before, and he believed- the; change
would be the best course for them to
pursue, .in several senses of the word.
All this happened: two. years ago.
During v that time trie Holdens, with
the assistance of two old family ser
vants who had been; in the wilderness
with them before," lived in ! the moun
tains' without seeing anything iri the
nature of society. ';' But: the mine was
put on its feet, a competent, and trust-;
worthy superintendent had been' train-
ed by Mr. Holden himself, arid there
was no reason- for : them to [stay away
from Chicago any -longer. Having re-
GERMANY seems to be leading in a "movement to the
Continental nations in a mutual trade arrangement inimical to i
the commerce of the United States. This bund was dis
cussed five years ago, but the matter did not pass the academic j
stage. At present France seems to be standing off, no doubt being j
affected by her large export trade to this country, which she de
sires to retain, and by the reciprocity treaty with us.
* A large number of reciprocity treaties negotiated by our reci
procity commissioner, Mr. John A. Kasson, failed in the Senate or
were withdrawn under fire, and this seems to have afforded to
Germany the opportunity of which she is now taking advantage.
A combination of Germany, Austro-Hungary and Italy against us ;
could no doubt quite seriously affect our trade for a time. If it '
should extend to the Scandinavian states its effects would be still ;
more acute. If the nations in such a bund can expel our commerce j
and at the same time continue to dump upon iis millions of their '
surplus population, an acute condition will be developed that must ;
have' the attention of our statesmen. I
A decline in our export trade will inevitably throw much labor;
out of employment. This disuse of labor will extend to every branch
of employment, from agriculture to transportation. We are now
producing a surplus far in excess of domestic needs, that must find
a market abroad. We may replace someof the lost European market ;
in Asia, for our trade in that direction is growing. But for a time \
we may expect to face the disuse of labor and at the same time the^
increase in its supply by immigration from the very countries that;
are cutting off our commerce. This will give point to the discussion !
of the immigration question. The. European countries, from which . !
most of it is 1 coming, are glad but not grateful for the relief. If is [
like letting out bad blood. They can boast of a decrease" in crime,
pauperism and insanity, because they; are exporting the cause of .
those evils, and relieving a congested population in '"which they;
flourish. We cannot at once be shut out of their commerce and be
compelled to assimilate their moral and physical diseases'.
Of course it is possible that our Government, may do some
thing that will prevent the formation of the combination against us.
3t seems to have been promoted by some inexplicable things done by
American Consuls. In order to test the accuracy of invoices of
Â£oods that bear an ad valorem duty it is necessary that the consular
invoice shall state truthfully the home price at the point of origin
<if the merchandise, and this is the business of the American Consul,
by which he protects our revenues and prevents undervaluation.
But when in addition to this the Consul demands a verified state
ment of wages paid in . the production of the merchandise, the
amount of capital employed, dividends paid and mortgages on the
works, it seems to us that the inquiry becomes impertinent and is
entirely outside the proper consular function. We are not aware
that any foreign Consuls in this country make such an investiga
tion and cause the right of export to depend upon its result.
The German press has been giving hot treatment to this con
duct of American Consuls, and McCreevy, our Consul af Glauchau,
Saxony, publishes this statement:- "I shall continue to require
calculations in accordance with departmental instructions' and con
sular regulations. No honest man need fear the light of investiga
tion. Experience has proved that the exporter receiving the most
consideration is the first to complain when called to account for
irregularities." ; '..:iX^^-'"v': ' ',- .' . . â¢ "
We are at a loss for a reason : for requiring the* disclosure of
such business confidences as the amount of profits or dividends, as
sets and liabilities, as a condition precedent to making an export.
We are also of the opinion that if such disclosures were required of
American producers by foreign Consuls, our Government would be
asked to interfere. The Consul must ascertain the value of exported
merchandise in the market at the point of origin or departure. This
market value may at times have but little relation to the costtjof
production, and certainly no relation to a mortgage on the plant that
produces it. The complaint against such a sweeping inquiry seems
to be justified.
. The remarks of Mr. McCreevy bearing upon business morals
are inexplicable. We are not the trustee of the business morals of
the peopTe of other nations. For revenue' purposes. we need only to
know the home value of exported merchandise. Our foreign Consuls '
are sent abroad to promote and not to impair the trade of -their
country. This matter requires some explanation. Perhaps the able
consular corps in San Francisco can throw some light upon .the
custom of nations. They are guided by the instructions of : *the
Governments they represent, and the uninformed public will be
curious to know if those instructions require a verification of the
profits, dividends and liabilities of the producer of merchandise for
export from this country.

Several weeks ago a petition was
filed in the Superior Court asking that
a guardian be appointed for the four
children of William P. and Margaret
Murray. It was alleged that the par
ents had quarreled and separated and
the children were not properly cared
for. â¢
Judge Graham summoned the par
ents before him and pointed out what
he believed to be their duty. â¢ A recon
ciliation was effected and the parents
promised to care for and educate their
children. The petition for letters of
guardianship was then dismissed.
Yesterday Mr. and Mrs. Murray, ac
companied by their little ones, all of
them dressed well and apparently In
good circumstances, entered Judge
Graham's chambers and asked for
permission to see the Judge. They
were given the permission and Mr.
Murray said that he and his family
had come to thank the court for what
it had done for them.
"Since taking your advice," said
Murray, "fortune has smiled upon us.
We are now In comfortable . circum
stances. We feel that your Honor has
saved us from permanent separation."
Judge Graham Informed his visi
tors that he was as much pleased as
they that his advice had had the In
tended effect and advised them that
IT in . the course of life unhappiness
again came to them to remember
their experience of the present and
bury all troubles for the sake of not
only their little ones, but themselves

A veritable love feast, at which en
thusiastic patriotism and sentiment
flowed unchecked, occupied \u25a0 several
hours yesterday at the Hotel Argyle.
The Mexican War Veterenas and
Widows anfl Daughters provided a
banquet in commemoration of the bat
tle of Palo Alto, May 8. 1846.
Amid a menu of dainty viands, toasts,
remarks and' a poem were given with
heartfelt pleasure,, a Mexican orchestra
Interspersing with languorous music.
The first salute, silently offered to ."Our
Fallen Comrades," cast its sadness
gently over the gathering, but. sweetly
tempering the spirit of patriotism so
thoroughly alive. Major Edward Sher
man responded to the toast "The Day
We Celebrate." Miss Pitsinger, in of
fering an original reading, "A Poem of
the Soul," embodied many beautiful
and practical sentiments appropriate to
this occasion and to life. The interest
ing words of Mrs- Coffey held rapt at
tention. She is the widow of Colonel
Coffey, who was at Alamo, and a wit
ness - herself of the scenes of carnage.
Eighty-two years of age,. Mrs. Coffey
made a picture of mental and physical
vitality that will not be forgotten by
those who saw her. Colonel Coffey was
a grandnephew and adopted son of
Andrew Jackson; Mrs. Coffey a grand
niece of the same. Her speech was re
warded with three rousing cheers, the
only compliment of its kind paid dur
ing the feast. Tokens of the day were
distributed to each in the way of small
Bteins, contributed by Mrs. J. L. Mar
i tel. Mrs. Robert Armstrong Dean,
called "the daughter of the regiment,"
presented wine for the banquet, while
the piece de resistance, a monster cake,
was the gift of the Wives and Daugh
ters of Veterans. Upon this was in
scribed "Palo Alto, 1846." The grill
room was' gayly festooned with the col
ors, green and yellow, ;ribbons, flags,
banners carrying the scheme. These,
with two exquisite wax figures, a se
norita and a cabellero, were given for
the time by Mrs. N. C Burnett, presi
dent of the Wives and Daughters. The
afternoon. closed with singing of na
tional songs by Elizabeth and Eric
Davis, two youthful vocalists who
added much to the general enjoyment.

near Seventeenth street, leaving- a
large portion of Dolores street. on
either side of Sixteenth *bare. The

and asked for an additional approprla-

School Directors Boyle and Altmann
appeared yesterday before the Finance
Committee - of -the * Board of Supervi
sors and called attention to the dan
gerous condition of the foundation of
the Agassiz- School buildiriff. Boyle
urged the committee to take ' imme
diate action. â¢ '
"We discovered that fake Piers had
been Â§ put in the foundation * of * the
building," said Boyle. '"The^piers had
been sawed off \u25a0 and gave no | support.
Soon as the discovery â¢ was \u25a0 made ' .we
put . our carpenters to work and - they
labored all Saturday afternoon and on
Sunday to prop up, the, building." :
Boyle and' Altmann: pleaded with
the committee to set aside sufficient
money . out of the urgent i\ necessity
fund to construct ' a concrete \u25a0 founda
tion under the building. . The Finance
Committee . agreed . to visit the build
ing immediately and expressed its .wil
lingness to do all that is necessary to
make it safe. _ V |

of -â¢ the missionary, and paid - a :; high
I compliment to Missionary Miller of San
Francisco, who Vis doing yeoman j work
on the missionary field; '
The recall of Dr/H.N. Allen as Unit
ed States Minister to Korea had caused
much surprise - and ; protest son' the part
of the people, said 'Bostwick.
The people, he said,' did ; not wish a
change, as the doctor-.was-accomplish
ing his duties in so â¢ efficient a manner
â¢'that they would not; have desired'the
anger Gabriel to have taken his place."
! The Rev.- H. \u25a0 W. Harbaugh : questioned
Bostwick as to the comparative | civili
zation of Korea and Japan land*" the
answer was that the 'work :of .Japan
for civilization was far superior; to that
of Korea. 1 , Hopes, indeed, -were "enter
tained that Japan' would bring Korea
;to a "better state of things." Misslon
! ary work in Korea, said Bostwick,
would go along, with the fostering, care
of Japan. -In Japan,- fhe said, ; .there
. was religious liberty and^he...' would
â¢ prefer Japan's paganism to the so
called Christianity of Russia..

Decrees of divorce- were granted to
Orlando K. Fitzsimmons from Mary
Fitzsimmons for desertlbn; George E.
White from Etta M. White for extreme
crue'.fy; Gladys McLaughlln from John
Mclaughlin for cruelty; Abraham
Spigel from Paul Spigel for desertion;
John Lembke from Angle L<embke for
desertion, and 'Italo A. Calpestri from
Uenedetta Calpestri for cruelty and de
sertion. Calpeetri was formerly a
broker of Genoa. Italy, and Is now
employed as a clerk by J. F. Fugazl
& Co. of this city.
Suits for divorce were filed yester
day by Map' Carroll against Mark
Carroll for cruelty; Ada L. Sullivan
against Michael L. Sullivan for cruelty;
Emma McNaughten against Harry Mc-
Nau?hten for cruelty, and Eugenia
Lilly against George Lilly for cruelty.
G. O. Brookmiller filed suit to annul
his marriage to Jennie Lennon Brook
miller. Brookmiller says that when he
married Miss Lennon he was under the
impression that his first wife, Fannie
E. Brookmiller, was dead, but he has
learned that he was mistaken.
Judgre Hebbard has taken under ad
visement the action for divorce insti
tuted by Dr. G. R. Hubbell for divorce
from Dr. Harriet H. Hubbell on the
ground of cruelty. The parties were
classmates at Cooper Medical College,
graduating in 1890 and marrying short
ly after they had entered upon the
practice of their profession. A great
disparagement in their ages is appar
ent. Mrs. Hubbell's hair being silvery
white, while Dr. Hubbell Is young.
Dr. Hubbell testified that since his
marriage his wife has subjected him
to ' unreasonable espionage, has shad
owed and threatened him, and opened
his letters against his protest. in search
ctf proof of her constant charge that
he was unfaithful to her. She also
accused him of undue intimacy with
Miss May F. Hallett, who resides at a
Clay-street hotel, and said it was his
desire to get rid of her that he might
marry Miss Hallett.
Miss Hallett, her mother and her sis
ter denied the charge on the stand, cor
roborating Dr. Hubbell. Mrs. Hubbell
denied that she had treated her hus
band other than as a wife should when
she had grounds for suspicion! She
reiterated her belief that it is Dr. Hub
bell's Intention to marry Miss Hallett
If he can get a divorce, then told how
her husband had abused her ever since
he met the younger and prettier wo
man. After half a dozen witnesses had
reiterated the same tale Judge Hebbard
grew weary and ordered the case 'sub
mitted.
; NEW YORK,' MaY B.â "Nan" Patter
son's future is still uncertain. 4 Bail -has
been 4 provided^ for her, : but : District
Attorney^ Jerome : has .not yet decided
what ) action he will take In her case.
f This afternoon,^ after \ a long confer
ence with f Jerome^and V his assistant.
Rand, \u25a0, Miss Patterson's counsel . was
compelled : to : bear 'to -the : girl '} in the
Tombs^the disappointing news that she
may.- have f.to : : remain iin I prison â¢; for; at
least a week longer. ,The prisoner, bore
the i announcement with : fortitude, - al
though , she * had been led to \u25a0 believe
that she ; might ' be : granted ; her freedom
either, to-day : : or to-morrow. . At least
two j bondsmen are said Â°to be ready., to
give bail in any reasonable amount and
counsel , for - Miss ;> Patterson , say the
surety % will be provided without delay
as soon ' as \u25a0; the â¢ District Attorney , ex
presses" a. willingness ;to ; accept . it.
Jerome. lssued the following statement:
- In reference to the case of the people agalnÂ»t
Nan Patterson. I am unwilling" to make - any
statement other than this: "My -Information
In regard to the case present* a serious ques
tion - for -my decision â¢ and * one which \u25a0 I -must
decide m y?elf and not : permit -. the . newspapers
to decide. foi*. me. v I. have not yet' decided- U.*'"
..Abraham:" Levy,' . MisÃ Patterson's
counsel, said ; after the conference: f" \u25a0
.' Mr. Jerome promised that he would talc* up
the matter at the earliest possible moment' and
given his fullest attention. He will then let
us know \u25a0 what â¢ course , will be taken. - I am
bound until. he disposes of the matter to take
no further action and will not make any move
until that time. Mr. Jerome has now to decide
whether to admit .her to ball or discharge her
on hÂ«r " own i recognizance, dismiss the | indict
ment against her or again place her on trial.'
I have no doubt that Mr. Jerome will speedily
decide. ..'; :\u25a0- ;. . . ' \
The United Railroads wants: to .con
struct a turntable" at the end of its
Pacific-avenue line and has also
planned to build curves from Jackson
and Washington streets to connect that
double-street system with the Polk
street road. Operation and Service
would be greatly facilitated and .in
every way the improvement Is much
desired.
But out In the City Hall therÂ« is a
clash among the powers as to who has
the right to grive the municipality's per
mission to the tearing upx>f the streets
that the work might be done. The
company filed its petition for a permit
with the Board of Public Works. Yes
terday came the Board of Supervisors,
i with Supervisor Braunhart hotfoot in
his purpose, with the contention that
! what the corporation seeks is a fran
chise grant and therefore the board
alone has the authority to issue such
permits on behalf of the city.
Braunhart introduced a resolution
that was passed calling on the City
and County Attorney to designate of
ficially which department has the say
in giving permits to the street-car cor
poration.
Property owners filed a petition yes
terday that a safety station be erected
within the triangle formed by the
tracks of the Market, Hayes and Lar
kin streets car lines at the Junction
of the streets. The petition was re
ferred to the Finance Committee.
The sum of ' $750 was set aside to
complete the plans for the building of
the Washington Grammar and the
Crocker Grammar sphool buildings.
The sum of 52750 was ordered paid
to W. J. Hawkins as the purchase price
for the lot adjoining the Crocker Gram
i mar School.
The sum of $750 was set aside to in
vestigate the available sources of water
supply for the city.

clubs. The exhibitions are: to be con
ducted under the control of. the Chief
of "Police; and principals ; inV amateur
contests shall: be paid a sum not to ex
ceed , $35 for ' training . expenses and a
medal not exceeding in value $15.- The

Another new section .provides that
permission shall not : be granted to any
professional club to. hold amateur con
tests, nor shall permission be given to
any amateur organization? to* promote
or hold professional contests, i Any: do
mestic incorporated club violating any
j of the provisions of the ordinance shall

BOSTON, May 8. â Poultney Bigelow,
the correspondent, has "created -a sensa
tion here by his startling charges re
garding the United States consular ser
vice in China, South Africa and South
America, and his statement that tha
United States is on the verge of war
with another great nation.
These statements were made before
the Boston University students and
faculty -in. an address which was one
of a series delivered by Bigelow on
"National Expansion." His caustic
comments on men * and affairs hava
amazed and stirred the faculty as no
other speaker has done for years. . Re
garding, the approaching war. Bigelow
said: . - : . \u0084 \u25a0-
At tho present tlmÂ» thÂ» United States- to
rushing- Into war with another nation, â¢ and th*
people know nothing about It. though the Gov
ernment Is straining every nerve to bring tho
country into a complete state of preparation.
' What nation? I have promised to keep it se
cret, although the war is sure to coins and we
will live to see. A great awakening will some
day dawn upon this land, and the people will
realize their unsuszxscted weakness, despite
their present opinion of their strength.
The statesmen of the Old World have named
us "the American peril.'.' All Europe is armed
and arming and keep their sharpest e>ye> turned
toward the United States in the> midst of the
preparations they are making.
He went on to arraign the consular
service of the United States, inveighing
bitterly against some of the things ha
had seen in China, the Philippines and
other countries. Said he:
When I waa In China not onÂ« of our Consols
at Shanghai was fit to associate with decent
Americans. . Consul Goodnow at Shanghai in
troduced the methods of Ames of Minneapolis,
where he had been a garbage collector. Into
the consular administration. When I was in
South Africa In 1596 there was not an Amer
ican Consul there who was ever known to he
sober.- . â¢
While the people in the Philippines clamor
vainly for a comparatively Inexpensive drain
age system the Government spends millions of
dollars to \u25a0 make a little dime museum exhibit
for the St. Louis Fair. We strive to have
financiers invest their money In the Philippines,
but they are not going to be bamboozled by
pictures of a lot of dancing Moro savages. -â¢ It
Is about time that the hidden canker of politics
should be exposed to the public and the truth
> of the national policy should be told \u25a0 them.
All that the people of this country seem to
desire is to have somebody continually prais
ing them and telling them what a great nation
they ares, but that Is a false outlook on life.
and la sure to work harm unless it Is stopped.
i These are some of. the many Bigelow
isms that have set staid ' old Boston to

Prunes and Raisins in New York.
Late mall advices from New York say: Th*
uearrr approach of the .spring . consuming sea
eon, when there Is normally a good outlet
offered for most varieties of California dried
fruits. U causing a better feeling- among hold
ers. This is accentuated by the fact that
ctocks of all kinds, both here and on the
coast, are. much smaller than usual at this
time of the year, while In the case of prunes
there seems to be no room for doubt that
the crop will be .one of the shortest for a
Eiimber of years .' past. The manifestation of
speculative interest, which was a pronounced
ieature of the local prune situation last week
is not cow apparent: but this Is believed to
be due to the fact that desirable stock Is
no longer obtainable at prices then 'current,
rather than to any diminution of such In
terest. There is. however, reported to be a
very rood demand from jobbers for email
lots, nainly of 4Oa and 80s. Stocks of these
dies on spot, sound and otherwise desirable,
\u25a0\u25a0re apparently becoming scarce and prices on
them have an upward tendency. While there
has bÂ«Â«i no further quotable change in prices
it 1* becoming increasingly difficult to pet
either sire at the inside quotations. The coast
market is reported to be strong and fairly
active. Advices from there recently made it
doubtful if 4Os can be bought for prompt
shipment below 2c f. o. b basis. A steady
thoujrh not larre demand for (spot seeded raUins
is acted, but more Important buying is made
impossible by the limited rupply here and
absence of offerings sin that grade from th*
"\u25a0Â«rt. The tendency of prices is upward, and
while it is possible that <Hie will etlll buy
fan^y coart seeded 6%c Is a more general
quotation, while up to 6Hc Is asked In some
l:xtfi.nc*s. Choice are In moderate supply on
the fpot and held firmly at s>4c. but there
**err.s to bÂ« little demand for this grade aa
yet. On most brands of Eastern seeded CiWIJ-ic
1* quoted, but some seeders are 'still accepting
orders at 5%c.

The Statistical Position Strong and
Improving.
ThÂ« New York circular of Henry Nordllngw
& Co. says of coSee':
The fear which dominated all coffee trading
circles that there would bÂ« a wholesale throw
ing overboard of coSee contracts for May de
livery on our zr.arket at about the time when
notices for such delivery should be issued
proved to have been groundless. The advent
of notice day was heralded by a steady market
and met with th* acceptance of very large
tenders on the part of oae of our princnÂ»<
import*ra. Thus this heretofore disturbing
feature waa eliminated.
A great improvement In the actual position
took place during the past month, but it was
overshadowed by the above mentioned fear.
This lmpro\-ement consisted of a sharp failing
off In the receipts at Rio and Santos, a fur
ther advance of about 10 per cent In the Bra
zilian rate of exchange, and & moct Important
reduction in the world's visible supply.
At the beginning of the past month a certain
Brazilian exporter, who has periodically given
forecasts as to the probable receipts during
the month. 6eat a cable giving his estimate of
the receipts for April as 150,000 bags at Rio
aad 2u0.0u0 at Santos. The April receipts at
Klo and Santos were about 185,000 bass less
than this estimate and about 100.000 bags less
thaa !h*>- were during the same month last
year, and certainly no oae in the trade expect
ed th^tn to be as small as they turned out to
b*. This has had the effect of modifying- pre
vious expectations of the else of the crop.
Wh!lrt only about a month ago ideas prevailed
that the present Rio and Santos crop would
give at least ten and a quarter mlUloas bags,
and poeslbly ten and a half million bags, it
begins to dawn upon the trade that we will
barely have 10,000.000 bags, against 10,400.000
bers last year.
The receipts of mild coffees tn Europe and
the United States during last month were con
siderably lees than during the same time | a
year ago: In fact, were even smaller than they
have been for many years past during the
month of April, and when we bear in mind
that the height of the mild coffee movement
is cow on we must conclude that there will be
a considerable falling on! in the receipts of
these after a month or so has passed. This is
quite In Une with the Information received
early in the year that the mild coffee crops
would turn out exceptionally email.
The reduction In the world's visible supply
of cofif-t during the past month was about
â¢73.000 bagÂ£- This is a heavier reduction than
Â«â¢\u25a0Â» have seen in any one month of recent years,
tnd a further reduction of about the same ex
tcr.t will probably be witnessed a month
hfr.ee.

: Without anjvprbvocation whatsoever
{ on her part, the lady continued, Mr.
Davidsohn belabored her back with the
I stick, and when her husband, naturally
1 angered by the treatment to which she
was being subjected, picked up a shovel
with intent to intimidate, and certain
! ly not to attack Mr. Davidsohn, he .was
'promptly disarmed and smitten ion the
j arm with the weapon by that violent
} person. ..Both assaults were entirely
I uncalled for.
I Mr. Davidsohn vehemently denied
1 having beaten Mrs. Shapro with a stick
ior anything else. The most severe pun
ishment he visited upon the lady, he
. averred, was to grasp her shoulders
! and force her to squat in, the sand of
[ the lot wherein the incident occurred,
[and he did that; simply, to remover her
from his right of way and Bilence her
vilifying tongue. As Tor the striking
of Mr. Shapro with the shovel, he did
that in self-defense, but not with such
force as Mrs. Shapro had alleged.
Mr. Shapro exhibited , a bandaged
wrist as evidence that the - blow with
the shovel was no mere tap, but. when
the Judge requested him to remove the
bandage he resolutely declined to :. "do
feo, claiming that his surgeon i had/in
structed him to keep the .wound \u25a0 con J
; stantly covered if he 'desired to avoid
blood poisoning and lockjaw, and sev
eral other undesirable complicati6ns.

It was on April 19 that the assault*

continuance for one week was ordered,
and at the' second calling the . presen
tation of a physician's certificate that
the woman was unable to appear in

till yesterday. Then the. complainant's

that a reconciliation '. had, been effected
between his client* and *< her ; husband
. and she had decided " to refrain : from
prosecuting. . '. /.
"At the outset of this case," said the
Judge to the attorney, ."you called my

! Formal announcement was made by
officers of the Southern Pacific yester
day that within a short time its entire
suburban ferry and local train service
will be revolutionized. -Plans are un
1 der way for a twenty-minute service
i between here, and the Oakland and Ala
i meda shores, and \u25a0it will be put in ef
: feet as soon as alterations -in tracks
'on the 'other side* of the bay can be
! made; new equipment provided, and the
i running: schedule of boats and trains
arranged. '-... . "
It is proposed to operate all. boats and
i trains serving Oakland, Berkeley, Ala
; meda and-Fruitvale between 5:30 a. m.
[and 7:30 "p., m. ion a twenty-minute
schedule and -from 7:30 p. m. ". to .1:20
a. m. on a forty-minute schedule. Two
\u25a0\u25a0 trains will : serve Oakland and Fruit
| vale; ', that is," the East Oakland," terri
| tory, Including East Oakland," Fruitvale
iand Twenty-third \u25a0 avenue stations.
These .will enjoy, a through service by
: way "of First street, the only stop, be
[ ing made 'at Broadway, station. As I
; soon as track accommodations can be
arranged the -East Oakland and-Ala
meda broad gauge service will be oper
\ ated on the- swing or horseshoe plan,
.that is, every .twenty-minute train from
. Oakland ; pier, to .Fruitvale, via First
street; instead of switching and return
ing from 'that point, will continue
' around â¢to â¢ Alameda, . gathering up the
traffic -of the broad gauge line in that
city, that is now* being carried to Oak
land .-pier across the Harrison-street
bridge, and take it to the Alameda
pier. At corresponding intervals, sim
ilar trains from Alameda pier, connect
ing â¢ with ' the Alameda line boats, will
run out 'Railroad \u25a0 avenue, Alameda.
: thence on . around through Fruitvale
and East Oakland, taking the traffic of
that section to ; Oakland pier by way
of' First street. Discussing the pro
posed * changes _ General Passenger
Agent Goodman said yesterday:
The: highly decired - result of this plan will
be to . remove all traffic from thÂ« , estuary
bridg* except â¢ the' "Webstar - street . line, and
diverting the' Alameda broad gauge trarel to;
the Alameda mole. - It will also have thÂ« prac- !
tical effect \u25a0 of giving: X the central portion of !
Oakland a ten-minute- service to and from the j
city all day.', and a twenty-minute service till
late at night. Another Important change will |
be in the collection 'of tickets on " the trains \u25a0
and the complete abandonment, of .the present I
method of gate collections at ths piers. Tbese I
gates will be removed.' thus affording free and [
easy movement < of the crowds to and from i
the boats. I As soon as the work of construction
.will permit the track accommodations the
piers will be much enlarged.. so as to aid the
[â¢readier flow of travel. ' '
| Pending other work of construction, such as
connecting the Alameda broad gauge on Rail
road avenue line with the Alameda pier, and a
- few . othtt matters. It may ,be necessary to
carry, the Oakland broad gauge business via
Fruitvale. but It' will not Involve any \u25a0 loss of .
time or .other Inconvenience and. will only be
temporary, â¢ and the ultimate \u25a0 result when all
plans are fully perfected will be a vastly, lm-,

warmed his heart, Judge Hebbard |
suggested in â¢ his court yesterday 1
morning that District Attorney By- j
ington and Attorney Henry "Ach
should have a combat of fists. De- j
sire or courage, one or the other, was J
absent from the breasts of the^ bar
risters, however, and they contented
themselves by calling each other; liars
and the associates of fallen women.
It was a remarkable scene. : Ach
had moved to have the trial of the'in
junction suits against the police, to
restrain them from interfering with
a den of vice at 620 Jackson street, re
stored to Judire Hebbard's calendar.
Judge Hebbard had thrown them out
of court because the District Attor
ney, dissatisfied with .; Hebbard'a rul- ,
ing in an order to show cause In the
case, had moved that the presiding
Judge appoint two Judges to sit with
Hebbard In the final hearing of the
suits. When Ach's motion to restore
the cases was called he immediately
clashed with the District Attorney.
The argument had not proceeded
far when Ach accused Byington of
consorting with fallen women. Bying
ton denied the charge and declared
that an attorney who would accept a
fee from the inmates of a brothel to
protect them in their calling was un
fit to oractice in the courts of Cali
fornia. Then each called the other, a
liar until . finally Hebbard, still warm
from the memory of Byington's mo
tion for the appointment of the two !
other Judges, leaned over the bench j
and In dramatic manner said: . \u25a0 !
If I didn't -weigh but fifty pounds and were ,
not just out of a fiick bed I would not take the
language either of you addressed to the other j
without strongly resanting'it outside the court- j
room. There is no Southern spirit In either of i
you-
I was angry on Friday and I am still pro
voked, and if I were net, being a. Judge on
the bench and treated aa I was. I would not be
with red blood flowing In my body. I thank
God I am human, if I am a Judge.
So far as this case is concerned it has prac- j
tically been determined. The facts have been !
found. ThÂ« court found that the premises are I
of a house of prostitution and the court found >
that the acts of the police were that they ar- I
rested people on charges of misdemeanor, not j
committed in their presence, without warrant, j
Upon these facts the court declared the police t
were acting contrary to law, and no other de- i
"cislon has beÂ«n made or would be made by a J
Judge that knows the law and has the nerve |
to declare It. . .
Ido not want to try the case. I believe it is !
ray duty to do it, but I do not want to. I j
unfortunately an able to read between the [
lines of written papÂ«rs and understand the j
covert meaning of plain English language. 1
am simply tired. For nearly fifteen years I
have been the subject of criticism of this kind,
and sow I go along the lines of least resist
ance. 1 will not try the cases, and the 'presid
ing Judge may do with them ac he 'sees fit.
This ended the controversy and
Ach must fight the battle of the in
mates of 620 Jackson street in some
other department of the Superior
Court.
