Green Men Are Cause
of a Disastrous
Collision.
Accident in Wblch Twenty-
Nine Are Hurt Ma:ks tie
First Day ol Strike.
More Than a Million People Dependent
on Rapid Transit Lines Suffer
Incomenience.
XEW YORK. March 7.â With one
collision in which twenty-nine persons
were injured and none killed. New
York has passed through the first day
of the general strike on its rapid tran
sit system. By this accident and some
minor casualties due to the abnormal
conditions, the Bam total of the day
was annoyance and vexation to a mil
lion,or more people usually dependent
upon the Interborough's line for trans
portation to and from business. So far
there has been little disorder. Sporadic
encounters between individuals, some
bad language and the action of a few
hoodlums in throwing missiles at pass
ing elevated trains tell this phase of
the strike. The annoyance to the mul
titude was increased by a wet snow
which began falling this afternoon.
Service on the ekvated roads and sub
way, while not tied up. was crippled
badly. Trains were run on irregular
schedules in the underground, begin
ning with the early morning, but the
elevated lines did not fare bo well. On
the East Side practically no attempt
was made to institute a service, while
the Sixth and Ninth avenue lines which
serve the West Side were run in a
fashion woefully inadequate. In fa< t,
the elevated system of the Interbor
ough's linos was pretty well paralyzed.
Th-> company's entire energy seemed
to he directed to an effort to maintain
service in the Fuhway, and in this it
was partially successful. Strike break
Â«i Farley and his crew of 700 or 800
men were thrown into the tunnel; offi
cials of the company gave this system
ttvir personal attention and an enor
mous number of policemen were de
tailed t<> the trains and stations. The
attempt to run express trains was
abandoned early in the day. Every
available man was put on the locals
and a fairly pood schedule was main
tained during the evening rush hours
until the accident at Twenty-third
street took plae*. This upset things,
but after strenuous effort th*y wÂ»-^
straiehtc-ned out and a service w &J ie
sum*ed on a headway of from five to
seven minutes.
The a.rident at Twenty-third st-eet
was in the nature of a rear-end colli
sion, due, it is said, to the inexperience
of the men on the trains. Two cars
had their ends smashed in and there
was a panic among the scores of pas
sengers. Of the injured fifteen were so
severely hurt that they had to be sent
to the hospitals. Traffic was delayed
for more than two hours, from 5 o'clock
until after 7 o'clock. A local train
bound up-town had Just drawn into
Twenty-third street station and some
of the passengers were about to alight
there when there came a crash as a
train which had left the bridge only
thirty seconds after the first train
dashed into the first train standing
at Twenty-third street. The rear car
on thf- first train was forced into the
rear of the car Just ahead. All of the
lights of the first train went out and
a moment later were heard the cries
of the injured and panic-stricken pas
sengers. Those who were standing in
the two reaV cars of the rear train and
the first two cars of %he second train
were thrown to the floor. The passen
gers standing on the platform of the
last two cars of the first train were
caught as in c vise. It was here that
all of those who were hurt received
their injuries.
Policemen and firemen were sum
moned to chop the cars apart and
rescue the imprisoned. It was fifteen
minutes before the first of the victims
were released. Meantime, some of the
cooler of the passengers In the train
had lighted matches In the cars and
were assisting the women to the doors
at the unbroken ends of the two cars
and in a few minutes men and women
were being passed through the broken
windows to the platform. Some of
them were carried across the tracks to
the downtown station.
The firemen worked for more than an
hour before they were able to remove
the last of the Injured passengers from
the car. â¢
Mayor George B. McClellan late this
afternoon reached the conclusion that
the transportation question had as
named such a serious aspect that it

NEW YORK. March 7.â Fire was dis

The tire started in some rubbish in a

storeroom where it started to the sec

REPORT OF ANALYSIS
GIVEN AT INQUEST
BY TWO CHEMISTS
Doctors ? Shorey and Duncan Testify
That i Strychnine Was Found in .;' -
M vs.- Stanford's Stomach, j ; j,.
HONOI-''Ll', March 7. â When the
inquest into the death of Mrs. Jane L.
Stanford was resinned this afternoon
the first witness called to the stand
v as R. A. Duncan, Pood Â« 'ommissloner
and Chemical Analyst to the Board of
Health. He testified that three analy
ses of th/ v bottle of bicarbonate of soda
found in Mrs. Stanford's room had
been made. He said: "I made the
first analysis alone, and in ten grams
of the bicarbonate of soda I obtained
seven hundredths of a grain of strych
nia. The second analysis I made in
conjunction with Dr. . Edmund Storey,
chemist of the United States Agricul
tural Station. In ten grams of the bi
carbonate of soda we obtained thir
teen hundredths of a grain of strych
nia. In the third analysis of the same
amount of the bicarbonate of soda we
secured fourteen hundredths of a grain
of strychnia.
"By calculation we estimated that in
the bottle were forty-three grams of
bicarbonate of soda and that the bot
tle contained half a grain of strychnia.
The methods of analysis used In the
last two experiments were the most re
liable.
"We examined a portion of the con
tents of the stomach with a negative
result for strychnia. We further exam
ined one kidney and some of the con
tents of the intestines, but were un
able to separate any poison from the
substance, yet we obtained the color
reaction characteristic of strychnine.
"We then combined all the remain
ing organs, including the liver, and
found that a test of an extraction gave
the same results as the intestines,
namely, the color reaction indicative of
strychnine.
"The test we used is known as the
fading purple test, and, so far as I
know, it is the most reliable test. The
color reaction we obtained is not pro
duced except by strychnia. We were
not able to isolate any strychnia. "
Continuing, Dr. Duncan said that he
had consulted the standard authorities
while â¢vorklnjr. The reason the strych
nia wab inseparable, he explained, was
that the amount was too small and
was distributed in a body of matter.
POISON IN CAPSULES.
Dr. Duncan also testified that they
analyzed the cascara capsules, one of
which Mrs. Stanford took before retir
ing. They were found to contain nux
vomica. The average weight of each
capsule was three and sixteen hun
dredths grains.
The total alkaloids in each capsule
was one-fifteenth of a grain of brucine
and strychnine in equal parts.
Brucine is an alkaloid poison, but

POSSIBILITY
OF SUICIDE
Attempt to Establish
This Theory Causes
Jar at Inruest.
By Associated Press.
HONOLULU. March 7.â Attorney
General Andrews and Deputy Sheriff
Rawlins clashed at the inquest on the
death of Mrs. Stanford yesterday,
when the former tried to bring out
evidence showing the possibility that
the aged woman committed suicide.
"Did Mrs. Stanford complain of a
bitter taste such as would be noticed
by persons taking strychnine?" asked
the Attorney General of Miss Berner.
Rawlins shut off the answer and tried
to prevent further questioning on this
line, but Andrews persisted.
"Was there an examination of the
tongue and throat for indications of
strychnine?" demanded the Attorney
General.
It was then brought out that such
an investigation had not been made
The Attorney General continued on
this line of questioning with the idea
of establishing or eliminating the sui
cide theory. He tried to draw from
Miss Berner evidence that the wealthy
San Francisco woman had ended her
life, a victim of a peculiar mania.
It was Andrews' persistence in this
form of inquiry that caused the clash
with Deputy Sheriff Rawlins, who has
charge of the Inquest. Rawlins seemed
in a hurry to have the work finished
and resented such questioning as un
necessarily delaying the case.
Though the chemists have found
strychnine in Mrs. Stanford's stomach
and in the bicarbonate, proving be
yond doubt that she was poisoned. High
Sheriff Henry is disappointed that the
results do not furnish evidence in
stronger form. The poison could only
be traced by the color test.
Evidently High' Sheriff Henry is
pleased with the work of the San Fran
crisco police, as he commented upon it
to-day. "I appreciate what they have
done in the case very much," he said.
"We have been working in perfect har
mony."
Attorney General Andrews' questions
intended to develop a suicide theory
have roused much comment here. The
Attorney General did not appear at the
inquest to-day.

Deputy Sheriff Rawlina, who pre

Shorey answered: "I have not

that we developed the color reaction

The cij\or reaction is caused by the

Mrs. Highton further testified that
Mrs. Stanford appeared to be afraid
that the attempt to poison her would
be repeated.
In presenting the chemists' written
report to the jury to-nig-ht Dr. Bhqrej
made'the furthf-r statement that pos

ternoon session was not clear. He in
tended, he said, to state that the
examination of the organs obtained no
definite residue of strychnirte or any
thing else but color,
This result under the circumstances
indicated the presence of a minute,
quantity of strychnine, so minute that
it could neither be weighed or seen.

alkaloids there is always some loss of
the alkaloids.
Juror Hays â Do you positively pay
that strychnine was there?
Dr. Shorey â I will not say that any
thing was there that I could not see,
but the color reaction produced is not
knoyn to be produced by any other
substance than strychnine.
The remains of Mrs. Stanford will

ORCHARDISTS BEGIN SUIT
AGAINST WATER COMPANY
Would Stop Operations of Bay Cities
People In Santa Clara
Valley.
SAN JOSE, March 7â The suit of
Charles Miller against the Bay Cities
Water Company to prevent the defend
ant from taking the waters of this
valley to Oakland and San Francisco
commenced before Judge Rhodes in the
Superior Court to-day. Great interest
centers in the case, as the outcome will
affect hundred* of orchardlsts.
The Bay Cities Company is erecting
an immense water plant â¢at Coyote
station and has offered to furnish 100.
000,000 gallons water daily to San Fran
cisco and Oakland, and it is claimed
the taking of this water from the
county will dry up the wells and rob
the orchardists of underground water
strata. A permanent injunction is
asked to stop the operations of the
company. The case will be a bitterly
fought one, as the company has several
million dollars already invested In the
project. The suit is prosecuted by the
Home Protective Association, which is
composed of orchardists to fight the
company, and is one of a score of
similar suits filed.
Charles Miller, the plaintiff, and Ru
dolph Wilkes were the only witnesses
to-day. They testified that pumping in
adjoining ranches affected wells on
their places and they believed the im
mense works of the Bay Cities Com
pany would permanently injure them.
Garret McEnerney and Judge John
Garber appear for the water company
and 8. F. Leib and J. E. Richards for
the orchardists.

Former Housekeeper Makes Statement
of Her Reasons for Reticence.
PALO ALTO, March 7.â Nor4 Hop

has steadfastly refused to be inter
viewed, to-day grave the reason for her
strange reticence.
"Until I talked the matter over with
the detectives. " 6he said this after
noon, "I did not -want to say anything
for fear that my word* might be mis
construed and that 1 might cast a sus
picion on some one who was entirely
blameless. Although it is true that I
had been with Mrs. Stanford for five
years and was very close to her during
all this time, yet I saw nothing in any
of the servants' actions that indicated
the slightest animosity toward her.
Every one in the household loved her.

LEGISLATORS CLASH.
Hot Words Pass Between John and
Senator Lynch.
SACRAMENTO, March 7.â The
building and loan bill has been
the nemesis of the Legislature
from the opening to the closing
week. The last quarrel of note
occurred to-night between Assem
blyman Warren M. John of San Luis
Obispo and Senator Henry W. Lynch
of the same county. John, In speaking
against the building and loan bill last
evening, impugned the motives of the
Senate committee that drafted the
measure.
He roasted every one that had any
thing to do with the bill with the re
sult that Lynch, who hails from his
section of the Btate, went over to the
Assembly chamber to "call him down."
"You lie," said Lynch. "You know
you lie, and I won't stand for your
condemnation of my colleagues."
John was white with anger, but he
made no reply. Later he set about pre
paring a complaint against Lynch to
call him before the bar of the Assembly
to show cause why he should not be
punished for contempt.

nett yesterday.
McWhinney was in the svve&tbox for
nearly an hour. His interrogators
were Captain Burnett, Acting Chief
Spillane and District Attorney Bying
ton. The butler answered all ques
tions In a straightforward wEiy and
accounted for his movements in a
satisfactory manner. He consented to
bu photographed and was allowed to
go.
Shortly after he left, Miss Elizabeth
Richmond, the former maid of Mrs.
Stanford, pale and worn, hurried
through the front entrance of the Hall
of Justice. There was a hunted ex
pression i n her face and she tried to
stial in unobserved.
When she arrived, Attorney Mount
fcrd Wilson joined the inquisitors in
Captain Burnett's room. When told
of McWhinney's assertion that he had
not opened the bottle from which Mrs.
Stanford drank the poisoned water, the
pale little woman seemed a trifle
startled, but she stuck to her story.
She was made to go over again the
incidents of the thirteenth and four
teenth of January and was submitted
to a rigid cross-examination on every
point. She was made to account for
every movement made by her from a
point long ante-dating her employ
ment by Mrs. Stanford.
'Beverly did not accompany the
woman this time. H6 came after she
had been in the sweatbox for some
time. The former butler was put
t^.o-'-h a crow-examination equally
*a severe as the one undergone by
I never accused Miss Berner of
grafting," he asserted. "I never
grafted myself, either, but I took per
quisites when we were traveling in
Europe."
"What do you me^an by perqui
sites?" was asked.
"Well," he replied, "when we were
traveling: in Europe I used to take
commissions on sales. It is expected
and nobody ever complains about it."
"Did you take perquisites, as you
call them, in San Francisco?"
"I never did," replied Beverly
firmly. "Not one 5-cent piece. I got
my $75 a month and that is every
cent 1 made here."
"And Miss Berner did not take per
quisites?" %
"She did not; never to my knowl
edge. " Beverly was lingered at the
report that had been spread to the
effect that he had accused Miss Ber
ner of "grafting."
Beverly and Miss Richmond were
permitted to go and went out of the
building together.
"I told them that I would not need
them again until I receive word from
Honolulu," said Captain Burnett lat
er. "They will not be held under
guard by my order. /You may safely
say that." v
Nevertheless, it is reported that the
pair will be summoned to San Fran
cisco again to answer questions of the
police. Miss Richmond is still at the
Beverly home near Burlingame.
"I don't want my name dragged into
this case," demanded William McWhin
ney of the detectives when he was led
before them.
He was assured that no suspicion
rested on him whatever and that only
information was sought from him in
the interest of justice. But before the
detectives had finished the "sweating"
the former butler was induced to sit
for a photograph that will be filed
away with the police records of the
case.
At no time since the poisoning of
Mrs. Stanford on January 14 has it
been intimated that McWhinney might
be involved. His character was thor
oughly investigated and it was found
to be good. With the detectives yes
terday he was perfectly frank.
When he made his very important
contradiction of the statement of Miss
Richmond as to pulling the corks of
the Poland water bottles, the detec
tives desiring to press the point further
told him that Miss Richmond had said
that it wao he that had opened the two
bottles, one for Miss Berner and one
for Mrs. Stanford.
"No, no, Miss Richmond is mistaken
or you must have misunderstood her,"
answered McWhinney with" an air of
naivete, at which the smiles of the
sleuths could not be repressed.
Captain Burnett swung in his chair
that he might give vent to ill-sup
presj^d laughter.
McWhinney explained that he was
not regularly employed by Mrs. Stan
ford as butler. He had been engaged
temporarily only by the caterer who
was to take charge of the number of
social affairs she had planned. It was
early in January that McWhinney went
to work at the mansion and he re
mained at the residence until February
14.
"I was there when Mrs. Stanford
wag poisoned, but I really know noth
ing about the occurrence, for I did not
become acquainted to any degree with
the members of the household," Insisted
McWhlnney In trying to explain that
the detectives were wasting time in
questioning him.
But the time was not being wasted.
McWhinney was called on to detail
the arrangement of the rooms In the
mansion and tell who occupied each.
During: his service he occupied a room
on the first floor in the southwest
corner of the house, directly under Mrs.
Stanford's room. He did not know
who of the household had access to her
room.
"When did you first hear that Mrs.
Stanford had been poisoned?" Mc-
Whinney was asked.
"I think It was on the evening of
January 21, ,the day the report of the
analysis was received from the drug
gist."
"Who first told you about it?"
"I wouldn't say positively, but I
think It was Miss Richmond. It was
either Saturday evening or an evening
or two after that. We were at dinner.
Miss Richmond taking her meals with,
the rest of us. and I think it was dur
ing the conversation about the table
that she informed me of what had oc
curred on the evening of January 14
and what the chemist had reported."
In subsequent conversation about the
house McWhinney had learned all the
available details.
"Did you uncork the bottle of Poland
water from which Mrs. Stanford took
the poisoned potion and which later
was found to contain strychnine?"
"I did not."
"Did you ever open a bottle of Poland
water that was taken to Mrs. Stan
ford's room?"
"Yes, on the evening: she was pois
oned I uncorked a bottle that was
taken to her room. But the poison was
found in another bottle, the one that
had been placed in her room the even
ing before."
"Were you in the habit of uncorking
the mineral water bottles?"
"I was not. The only one I ever
opened was that which was taken to
Mrs. Stanford Saturday evening and
which she did not touch."
"Who asked you to draw the cork
from that bottle?"
"Miss Richmond did. ShÂ© came to
me directly we had finished our dinner
on Saturday evening and asked me to
open the bottle. I did so and gave her
the bottle."
"But Miss Berger says you pulled the
corks from two bottles of Poland water
Friday evening and that in the one
taken to Mrs. Stanford the poison was
found subsequently?"
"I did not open one bottle or two
bottles or any bottle at that time or
any time other than the occasion I
have mentioned. If Miss Richmond
told you that she was mistaken or you
misunderstood her."

DEATH CALLS
LITTLE FATHER
OF GONDOLIERS
FAMOUS GONDOLIER BT WHOSE
DEATH VENICE LOST HER MOST
PICTURESQUE CHARACTER.
VENICE, March 7. â By the death
of Luigi Zatta, the famous Venetian
gondolier, the queen city of the Adri
atic has lost, a most picturesque char
acter, who was known and esteemed
far beyond the borders of Italy. Hon
est, witty but respectful, proud of his
calling and devoted to Venice, he be
longed to the old order of gondoliers,
of which there are few specimens now
remaining. Many are the stories toid
of his prowess and battles for th 1 ?
honor of his town and profession. He
was long known as the "Little Father
of the Gondoliers" and assumed
rather more authority over them than
the courtesy title conferred on him.
not hesitating to enforce discipline b>
corporal punishment. Of late years
many who are not Venetians have
taken to the business and Zatta much
resented this alien invasion to which
he ascribed the decadence of the old
traditions of courtesy and fellowshio
among the knights of the oar. On one
occasion he created a sensation by
pitching into one of the foreigners
who had demanded from a woman,
with threats, more than his proper
fare. They tumbled into the Grand
Canal together and the old chap was
nearly drowned, but he felt amply
consoled for that by the severe drub
bing and ducking the other fellow re
ceived. This episode led really to h'Â«
death, as the fellow one night knifea
Zatta in the back, reopening an 01J
wound received in the war of inde
pendence, and which never again
healed.
The old man was very fond of the
ladies, admiring particularly foreign!
types, and as he never forgot a face,
his friends all over the world were le
gion. He was a great match-maker,
too. If he had a young couple in his
gondola he would take them to the
most romantic spots, especially if it
were moonlight, and sing love songs
over their heads in his beautiful tenor
voice, until only the stoniest hearts
could resist the spell of the enchant
ment. .If necessary he would divert the
attention of the chaperone by telling
her blood curdling stories of what had
happened in the different historic pal
aces, his pretty broken English add
ing much to the interest of his narra
t'.ves.
The great event of Zatta's life was
on the day he carried his hero. Gari

but it was also the day of his "grreat
shame," as he called it, as he wap so

tition for divorce. William F. Cody
(Buffalo Bill) to-day declared that he
could not accept a reconciliation with
Mrs. Cody and declared he would
have absolutely nothing to do with
her in the future. This declaration
was made as the result, as Colonel
Cody stated, of Mrs. Cody havln*
charged him with being the murderer
of their daughter Arta and announc
ing publicly that she would denounce
him over her grave.
A. M. Ridgley, for Colonel Cody,
stated that Mrs. Cody had not been
sincere in her expressed wish for a re
conciliation and In making it had
placed such conditions on her accept
ance of such an event as to preclude
any chance of Cody's accepting them.
Cody was questioned about the sep

Cody In 1877. He said that It result

PRETTY EFFECT IN GALLERY
Splendid Decorations Call for
Words of Praise.
SALLY SHARP
From the gabled window* of the
Art Palace that crowns the proudest
hill of the City by the Golden Gate, a
flood of light proclaims to the silent
city below that the Mardi Gras is on
â that Joy is King, and care clean
/ergot. And loud the heralds pro
claimed the glad tidings â loud enough
tor the poor old pessimists below to
hrar, if they only would! But that's
not a part of their religion, unhappily.
Never in all its gay career was the
great hall so gay. Yellow and red
lenterns sent abroad a glow of warmth
that blended magically with the battle
â¢f color below.
Strings of colored lights, akin to the
|rms that lie in the bosom of Mother
Earth, gleamed from the groined
arches, giving a living quality to the
famous tapestries that look from the
niches above.
Even the splendid paintings were
â hings, ir. the weird light â but
perhaps it was only atmosphere, that
etrange Intangible thing thai shapes
our conceptions. It must have been
atmosphere because it's an indisput
able fact that the ball is itself a thing
of atmosphere.
IX THE GALLERY.
But it was in the Searles Gallery
that the really smashing effects were
produced. Carnival colors, red and
I yellow, were blended with the trium
phant colors if Joan of Arc, and only
as the artist eye knows how.
Blessings on that fellow Breuner,
who gave us that splendid scheme of
i decoration, possessing, as it did, a sane
and holy scheme! â not so dazzling,
however, as last year, when Gamble
and Seawell were the wizards.
Last year, when the pageant, which
is- the event of the night, was passing
through Searles Gallery, the colored
lights were flashed from the west end
of the boxes, quite blinding the occu
pants of the east end boxes.
This year, by a clever manipulation
cif the decorative scheme, the lights
came from the south end of the gallery,
and with superb effect.
Nor was the ensemble of the hall
marred by the new plan, since Mr.
Hreuner reared a turreted and em
battled castle wherefrom to loose the

Overhead, threading delicately be
tween the scarfs of color, thousands of
, bulbs gave forth their exquisite gleam.
And sweetest of all, high above the
i lights, even as is God's work above
man's, rose the fir branches and the
â  pine, lining the air with their pungent
odor.
And the music! Ah! Here was the
â  allurement of sound.
To be sure, we always expect some
â  thing of Sir Henry Heyman, but last
I night he exceeded himself â here's
to him and his clever bandsmen.
THE GRAND MARCH.
At 10:30, His Graciousness, Edward
M. Greenway, announced the march.
There was a rush, a scramble, and

was on.
At the forefront there loomed up the

Arriving at the throne of turquoise

the stalwart soldiers haltedâ and Joan
descended.
Then the Bishop, H. W. Batchley,
arose, and with hands extended, and
eyes uplifted, blessed the fair maidâ
who wasn't a maid at allâ and then
admonished the revelers before him.
HIS ADMONITIONS.
And his admonitionsâ being a Bishop
âwere somewhat startling. To begin
with, they were short. Most Bishops 1
are not. Moreover he told a tale of
the Joy of living, and here's to that
kind of a Bishop!
As to the retainers of the fair "maid"
of Orleans, every costume was abso
lutely correct as to detail.
The personnel of the retainers was
made up of the students of the School
of Design, and a merry time they had,
these grown-up children.
Taken all in all, the Mardl Gras of
'05 goes down in history as the gayest,
n-K-rriest. dashin^est ball in the history
of the Art Association.
And it was not because of numbers,
but of that intangible thing â atmos
phere.
It was gay, gay to the core.
At twelve, supper was served. '
After supper things were gayer. But
not one whit over the limit â not a whit.
It was Manli Gras!

NEED A LESSON
IN ECONOMICS
Lieutenant Carden Wants
American Industries to
Adopt Foreign Methods
SAYS WE ARE WASTEFUL
TeJls of His Observations
Made While Visiting the
(â¢( â¢ re a t Kn r< >pea n PI ants
Lieutenant Godfrey Lynet Garden of
the United States revenue service, who
was specially assigned to the duty of
securing foreign machinery exhibits
for the recent St. Louis Exposition,
entertained a large audience at Stein
way Hall last evening with a lecture
on the 9merican invasion of Europe
In the race for commercial supremacy.
While abroad in the interest of the
exposition Lieutenant Carden made a
close study of the Industrial establish
ments of the Old World, visiting dur
ing his absence twelve hundred of the
more important manufacturing plants
of Great Britain, Germany, France,
Belgium, Italy and Switzerland, and
upon his return he incorporated his
observations in a report to the Wash
ington authorities.
The lieutenant's lecture, which was
given under the auspices of Troop A,
Cavalry, N. G. C, was interestingly
illustrated with Mereopticon views,
taken by him during his travels. The
speaker spoke at considerable length
about his visits to the industrial cen
ters, especially the great works of the
Krupps at Essen, the Levers at Port
Sunlight and Cadburys of Birming
ham, describing and illustrating thÂ«
superiority of the products of these
manufacturing concerns from the
standpoint of economics over the
similar products of American estab
lishments and drawing a comparison
between the social conditions of the
workingmen of both hemispheres,
which was certainly in favor of those
of Europe In many respects. Con
tinuing he said:
But if Europe leads us In economic*, when
it comes to machine tools and machinery for
making machinery. America leads the world.
Ten year* aeo one might have traveled the
length and breadth of the Khenwh provinces,
the irrsat iron and steel districts of Germany,
â¢nd everywhere, I am told, one would have.
laund for the mow i.art Knells* tools. To
day all this Is changed and in lieu of EnarH^h
tools one finds for all ordinary work German
ftork tools, but Invariably one find*- In all
the flrst-clas* establishments for a high grade
â work a croup erf American machine toolsâ
a tllent tribute to the excellence of our out
putc. I found tools from all of our flr*t
clafs shor* nd only from the first-class Â»hops.
There were non* of the second grade or third
trade roods In service. If one wishes to
}Â«am what are the host American tools go
tÂ» Germany. The Germans know, and they
will have none but th* }#â *[. The Germans
Â»rf :tic especially well In woodworking
machinery, ami there are a number of shops
at Offenbach. Bockenhetra and elsewhere which
are turning out a high-grade machine, but I
Â«Â« nothinr whlrh could excel the outputs
of euch a firm, for example, as Hall A- Brown
of SC Louis. The display of this St. l*>uis
house at the Worlds Fair was a marvel in
itself.
The lieutenant, however, contended
that America needs to look sharply at
Germany, where he says that technical
education is putting that country
where she is to-day. Between 1800
and 2000 young men are annually be
ing turned out from one institution at
Charlottenburg alone and in all the
institutions of that city there are about
8000 graduating each year and as fast
as they finish their studies they are
taken up by the big industrial con
cerns.
The influence of the German Em
peror has much to do with the pro
gress being made by that country and
much of the order and economy ob
served In Germany's industrial pur
suits, the speaker said, is undoubtedly
due to the preliminary training the
worklngmen receive in the army.

fAX EASY WAY
To Keep Well.
It is easy to keep well if we would
enly observe each day a few simple
rules of health.
. The all important thing is to keep the
etomach right, and to do this it is not
necessary to diet or to follow a set rule
or bill of fare. Such pampering simply
makes a capricious appetite and a feel-
icg that certain favorite articles of
food must be avoided.
Prof. Wiechold gives pretty good ad-
vice on this subject; he 6ays: "I am 68
years old and have never had a serious
illness, and at the same time my life
has been largely an indoor one, but I
early discovered that the way to keep
healthy was to keep a healthy stomach,
not by eating bran crackers or dieting
of any sort: on the contrary I always
eat wh&t my appetite craves, but daily
for the past eight years I have made it
a practice to lake one or two of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets after each meal
and I attribute my robust health for a
man of my age to the regular daily use
of Stuart's Tablets.
My physician first advised me to use
them because he said they were per-
fectly harmless and were not a secret
patent medicine, but contained only the
natural digestives, peptones and dias-
tase, and after using them a few weeks
I have never ceased to thank, him for
his advice. â 
I honestly believe the habit of taking
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after meals
Is the real health habit, because their
use brings health to the sick and ail-
ing and preserves health to the well
and strong."
Men and women past fifty years of
age need a safe digestive after meals
to insure a perfect digestion and to
ward off disease, and the safest, best
known and most widely .used is Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets.
They are found In every well regu-
lated household from Maine to Cali-
fornia and in Great Britain and Austra-
lia are rapidly pushing their way into
popular favor.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, full sized packages at 60 cents,
and fer a week stomach a fifty cent
package will often do fifty dollars*
worth of good. t -

JAPANESE CAPTURE
TOWN AND MAKE
RUSH FOR FOOD
Hope for Victory Is
Dim in Russian
Capital.
War Office Clings to
Faith in Kuro
patkin.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 8, 2:16
' a. m. â That the battle of Mukden will
1 go down In history with Liaoyang in
j the long list of Russian defeats is the
, almost universal belief in pessimistic
St. Petersburg, which has forgotten
the meaning of the word victory. The
> War Office does not admit that the Is
| sue of the great battle, which already
exceeds in magnitude of operations
[ and losses that of Shakhe, has been
i decided, although it is positively said
. in high quarters that Kuropatkin has
j telegraphed to Emperor Nicholas that
, it will be impossible to hold Mukden
; and that the withdrawal of the army
, northward has already begun.
Nothing from General Kuropatkin
, later than Monday has been given
; out, but advices to St Petersburg
newspapers and dispatches dated to
6 o'clock last night indicate that the
\ position of the Russian army after a
day of furioue and unprecedented
fighting is desperate, but not abso
lutely hopeless, some Russian corre
spondents even predicting a Russian
victory soon, and one affirming that
the extreme Japanese left has al
ready begun to retire southward.
Everything probably now depends
on General Kuropatkin's reserves.
While the Japanese hurled them
! selves forward af. every point yester
day, their main energies were behind
the blow west and southwest in an
attempt to envelop thÂ« Russian right
and drive a wedge through the line at
, Madyapu, but General Kuropatkin
seems to have been unable to success
fully change the front on the line of
his shattered right, aligning from
northwest to southwest to protect the
railroad at Mukden, and at nightfall
iit was reported he was practically
holding all his positions. At the same
tim* he was drawing in and shorten
ing his line to the southeast.
According to reports ali the concen
trated attacks of the> Japanese to the
westward failed, and the efforts of
Generals Nogi and Oku to push their
encircling movement north and east
ward across General Kuropatkin's
line of communication were blocked.
Reports, however, are conflicting.
If Kuropatkin has a plan for striking
a real blow, upon which, in the opinion
of experts, his salvation depends, there
is no indication yet of such a purpose.
The commander in chief has been con
fining his strategy, as at Liao Yang,
', to meeting the attacks of the Japanese
and accepting battle at places chosen
by Field Marshal Oyama.
Both sides are terribly exhausted by
ten days of continuous fighting, and
all the correspondents at the front in
timate that the issue must be decided
definitely to-day.
At the military clubs here General
Kuropatkin is already regarded as
beaten, the only question being his
] ability to execute a retreat. Those who
believe there is still a chance of actual
Russian victory are few and far be
tween. The majority regard the fight
ing yesterday as in reality a rear
guard action, entertaining no doubt
that there will be a heavy withdrawal
during the night. These officers, how
ever, are dependent upon practically
the same information as the public.
No exact figures are hazarded as to
the losses, although it is evident that
they will exceed those at Liaoyang
on both sides. According to all ac
counts the Japanese who had attack
, ed were the heavier losers everywhere
except j n the west. In the matter of
supplying food and ammunition the
Russians, occupying defensive lines,
; enjoy a great advantage, which may
: prove decisive at the crucial moment,
: all the dispatches from the front dwell
! ing upon the terrible exhaustion and
hunger of prisoners who have been
captured.
HEAVY JAPANESE LOSS.
Storming; of Gaotu Pass Costs the
Mikado 2000 Men.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 7.â Gen-
eral Kuropatkin, in a dispatch dated
March 6, says he counted thirty dead
Japanese officers and 2000 men in front
of the Gaotu Pass position. The Rus
sians buried many bodies.
Another dispatch from Kuropatkin,
dated March 6, says:
"The center is quiet. The Russian
flank west of Mukden continues its
offensive. The Japanese attempted to
occupy a village, name unknown, but
were repulsed. The Russian artillery
is still maintaining its position on
PoutiloffÂ«Hill. The Japanese attack on
Kandolisan was repulsed after three
hour?' fighting.
"The Japanese have again attacked
the Russian positions at Oubenepusa
and were repulsed there and also at
Tomaguchen with enormous loss.
"A Russian detachment on the left
has occupied a defile ten miles east of
Kondiatse. driving back a squadron
and a half of a company of Japanese,
who left their dead and threw away
their arms f n their flight."

DEFENSE OF FUSHUN.
TOKIO. March 7. â The greatest
concentration of the Russians defend
ing Fushun seems to be along the
line from Tieta to Manchuntan. Gen
eral Kuropatkin continues to reso
lutely defend the Russian position at
Fushun. The operations in that vi
oinlty do not indicate whether Ku
ropatkin intends to fight or retire, but
he must hold Fushun to protect the
Army on the Shakhe River.

morning. On the fourth attack the
Japanese were temporarily successful
in driving out the Russians and
rushed directly toward the field
kitchens, where the morning meal
was being prepared, and com
menced to holt the food. The Rus
sian troops, however, with a shout of
"Save our dinner, brothers," fell upon
the Japanese like a hurricane and
drove them out of the village at the
point of the bayonet.
JAPANESE STARTING.
A captured Japanese said they had
nothing to eat since Sunday and that
they had been told this morning
ether to capture the Russians' dinner
or e-tarve.
At Erdagou, on the center, a regi
ment of Chasseurs made a night at
tack, but the Russians were caught by
the Japanese flank' and many of them
were killed, fifty being captured.
At Bentsiaputze the Japanese
stormed as far as the wire entangle
ments, but were repulsed with great
loss.
An attack on the east front early
this morning resulted in the capture
of several Japanese positions near
Oubenepusa and the seizing of two
Japanese quick-flre guns.
The Japanese made a counter at
tack and a long and desperate strug
gle ensued, the Russians capturing a
third quick-fire gun and holding the
positions.
The cannonading in the neighbor
hood of Tatchekiao is now increasing
in intensity. The Japanese apparently
have brought up reinforcements and
are attempting to crush General Corn
gross.
The Japanese are bringing up sup
plies by the Sinmintin road and ap
parently are using the railroad aa a
line of communication.

plea that the latter has evinced a lack

SENATORS SHY
AT THE TREATY
WASHINGTON, March 7.â Without
determining any question of policy in
regard to the Santo Domingo treaty,
the Senate decided to-day that the
treaty should be reported as soon as
possible from the Committee on For
eign Relations and the entire question
fought out in executive session. This
was the sentiment of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee as well as the Senate
and in two sessions of the committee
the proceedings were with a view to
reporting the treaty to-morrow If pos
sible.
The amendments offered in the com
mittee were confined to a reduction of
an alleged surplusage ot words. They
were offered verbally and taken down
by a stenographer. They are to be
printed and considered when the com
mittee meets to-morrow. By a tacit
understanding the policy involved in
the treaty was not taken up by the
committee and it was understood that
the action in submitting amendments
in this manner did not commit any
Senator to support the treaty. The
programme was merely to facilitate ac
tion and remove all chance of its being
made a party question in the commit
tee.
The prompt action of the Foreign
Relations Committee undoubtedly will
result in a much earlier decision in the
Senate. Nearly every Senator who dis
cussed the treaty to-day expressed a
desire that the measure be kept from
becoming a party question. To pre
vent this Senator Bacon offered to
withdraw his resolution concerning the
protocol of an agreement entered into
between the United States in January,
1903, in reference to the Santo Domingo
Improvement Company's claim and
modify it. When he again offers it the
resolution will be general in character
and will ask that the Foreign Rela
tions Committee inquire and report
whether the Executive had the author
ity to make an agreement by which
the United States take charge of the
customs of another country.
IN COMMIT! EF/S HANDS.
Santo Domingo Protocol Amended
Only In Minor Way.
WASHINGTON. March 7.â Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations for
mally took up the Santo Domingo pro
tocol to-day, it having been referred
to the committee in executive session
of the Senate yesterday. The treaty
was read carefully and amendments
were offered for the purpose of cor
recting the phraseology-, but not di
rected at the policy involved in the
document. It was proposed to strike
out the words in the protocol which
seemed to define the Monroe doctrine,
this being regarded by a number of
Senators to be superfluous. Other ver
bal amendments were offered, but they
did not affect the purpose of the treaty.

MUKDEN, March 7, noon.â The
Japanese at 2 o'clock this morning at
tacked a Russian position on the Hun
River from Machlapu. The artillery
fire has been continuous and shifted
northward after daylight almost to
the Sinmintin road, from which
wounded and Chinese refugees are ar
riving. Fighting is heard also far to
the northward.
Numbers of wounded Japanese
along the Sinmintin road have been
brought in and cared for.
MUKDEN, March 6 (Delayed in
transmission). â The sixth day of the
battle on the Russian right flank
raged with undiminished vigor
from dawn till dark. The Japanese
made good their position at Tacha
and pushed the contest north to Sin
mintin the same as on Saturday. Four
miles from the main battle line,
though apparently nearer, as was the
case in the battle of Liaoyang. the
semi-circular positions where the bat
tle is progressing now are so near
that the whole of them are accessible
from Mukden in a day's march.
The losses already exceed those in
the battle of Liaoyang on the Russian
side and the Japanese are supposed
to have suffered much more, though
this does not seem to shake the Jap
anese tenacity, for at noon to-day
they attacked Yenhsitun, advancing
their infantry and provoking a coun
ter attack, which was first reported to
have resulted in Russian infantry oc
cupying Yenhsitun. About' 2 o'clock
in the afternoon, when the artillery
battle increased furiously, shells set
fire to many buildings, the smoke
from which joined a dust storm and
shrouded the vast plain in clouds.
The appearance of this region,
which has now been two days under
fire, begins to resemble a siege. Graves
are increasing in number, while dead
animals strew the ground. The troops
have been seven days without rest and
their pow-ers of endurance are declin
ing. They plainly show the strain of
the terrible week. The ground is
deeply frozen.
The Japanese continue to flank the
Russian position. One Japanese divi
sion is known to have extended to
Beling.
The Japanese maintained a frontal
attack Sunday night, having attacked
Shakhe, Erdagou and Huantai and
the extreme cart, where they are
again advancing. S The center remain 9
Russian, but on the southwest the
Russians are falling back on their
second position.
The army on the right wing is now
thrown back on the Russian settle
ment, converted it into a great
metropolis. At night long trains
of lighted cars are to be seen extend
ing in all directions on improvised
railways to camps where three days
ago there was nothing but bare fields.
In magnitude the present battle prom
ises to about equal the battle of
Shakhe River.
TWO MILES OF MUKDEN.
Kuroki Says Fight Will I^ast Several
Days Longer.
GENERAL KURORTS HEAD
QUARTERS IN THE FIELD, March
7, via Fusan (delayed in transmis
sionsâThe tenth day of the Japanese
attack finds the battle progressing fa
vorably. Its long duration was ex
pected and it will probably continue
several days more before it is con
cluded. The Japanese forces have
reached nearly to Mukden, within two
miles of the railway, and are bom
barding strongly.
The Russians everywhere are mak
ing a desperate resistance, frequently
trying offensive operations and ar
ranging every defensive device of mod
ern warfare.
The figirting resembles a siege more
than a field battle. The past two nights
there has been hard fighting in front
and east of Witosan. The infantry
were closely engaged while the Rus
sian batteries shelled the trenches and
star shells were used to illuminate the
battlefield. Hand grenades are em-
I*oyed freely in close fighting.
Last night the Russians attempted to
break the Japanese line by crossing the
river west of Witosan, but they were
rtpulsed.
This afternoon Red Cross flags were
raised in order that the wounded lying
on the slopes and between the hills
north of the river might be collected.
Judging by the long processions of
ambulances traveling northward the
Russians have many wounded.

Their money and valuables were swept I

Frank K. Mott Says That He
Believes That They Can Be
Had From City Eevenues
31 1 NICIPALIT Y\S NEEDS
Twenty Dollars Cannot Be
Made to Do Forty Dollars
Worth of Highways Work
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
101 C Broadway, March 7.
The people of the annexed district,
now the First Ward, listened to the
candidates of the Republican party to
night. Robert Cuthbert presided, and
there were short addresses by a num
ber of candidates, including: Abe P.
Leach, for City Attorney; A. H. Breed,
for Auditor: Charles D. Hates Jr., for
Treasurer: Frank K. Mott, for Mayor,
and Alex McAdam, for ward Council
man. This being McAdam's home
ward, he was given a round of cheers
v.hen he told what it was hoped to
accomplish for this newest section of
the city.
Frank Tv. Mott announced his gen
eral plan of improvement, in which he
said he was fcfV jrood streets and be
lieved that they could be maintained
from the revenues of the city Some
<>f Mr. Mott's sentiments were express
ed as follows:
It has been a pleasure as well as a duty
for me to get ;n touch with so many of my
fellow-citizens, who are without doubt as
keenly interested in the progress and Im
provement of Oakland as I am. Mrst of you
are thus concerned tor the same reason that
I am. Your interests are here as are mine.
Your horn's ai.o your businesses are benefited
by good government or injured by poor gov
ernment as mine are. We meet on a common
footing, and we go ahead or fall behind in
the march together. That which helps you
belpa n:<r and it is Just ai Important to me
that the city should be well governed as It li
M any man within hearing dirtance of ray
voice to-night. 1 desire to Impress this upon
you for several reasons, the most important
of which at the present time to me is the
bearing it has upon my relations to the voters
of this city an a nominee for the responsible
portion of Mayor. You may call this a
pelnnh motive if you please, and so it is to a
certain extent, but there is another aspect.
Is it not a fair i>resumini"n that a man who
has his personal prosperity dependent upon the
general DroaMrlty of his home city will sec
to it that his acts in an official capacity shall
not only reflect credit upon himself, but ahall
be guided always by a desire to conserve
the best imprests of the whole community.
Now how can that be best accomplished?
The Mayor of Oakland, under the municipal
charter, has large powers of supervision and
direction. He may indicate policies with re
lation to departmental affairs and indeed, it
is h'.s duty to thus supervise and direct. He
should be a close observer of the public needs
and should watch vigilantly and unremittingly
the operations of the municipal officials. His
advice should, be sought and should be given
on al! matter;" pertaining to thp administra
tion. In short he should be the people's direct
representative in the municipal organization.
Following that line of action it would be my
effort as Mayor of Oakland to readjust some
of the financial arrangements In order to pro
cure for necessary improvements a larger
share of the tax levy than has been allotted
heretofore. I refer particularly to the Street
Department. The demands for clean, well
kept thoroughfares corn* first on my- It9t.
These are not only necessary, but are beyond
all argument one of the prime needs of the
city. Your dfatrict is no exceDt'on. I am
satisfied that more money phould be spent
or the streets, that a way can be found to
get It without inoreaaing the tax levy, and
thdt a way will be found during my ad
ministration. This Is one of the items that
appeals most strongly to me. I say this in
no spirit of petty criticism. It Is a subject
to which I have given much attention and
there in no one for whom 1 stand aside in
this effort at Improvement.
In further emphasis of my attitude toward
municipal aTfaira I again place myself square
ly on record as favorable to the expenditure
of public funds legitimately in the acquisition
of betterments, that Is to say, of permanent
improvements. 1 am for a progressive ad
ministration, and by that I mean a policy
that will make for the city's advancement
with every dollar that goes out of the city's
treasury. We want to go ahead. We wan
that sr>lrlt to I'ormeate not only our public
officials and employes, but the citizens at
large and the City Hall should be the nucleus.
I am not going to promise to do a lot of
things that I know and you know cannot be
dne. I am not going to tell you that as
Mayor of Oakland I shall make $20 do $40
worth of work. But what I do tell you is
thlF plainly, flatly and unequH-ocally, as
Mayor of Oakland I shall demand intelligent,
careful and honest use of the taxpayers'
money. No man in this city has a right to
promise more than that, for more he could
not do and more you have no right to ask
him to do. â¢

BULLET REPLY
TO AN INSULT
Paul Frisbie Takes a Shot
at Edward Hall, Who Tried
to Seize Former's Wife
WOUND IS NOT SERIOUS
Woman Shows Assailant to
Her Husband, Who Speedily
Deals Out His Revenge
Oakland OfflcÂ« San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 7.
Edward Hall, who was shot last
niÂ»ht by Paul Frisbie for insulting the
latter's wife, is not dangerously wound
ed and will recover, while Frisbie is
still in jail. Hall was flat on the
ground at the time, and the bullet en
tered the fleshy part of the shoulder,
and is still embedded in the muscles.
Drs. Abbott and Riley have not located
the bullet, and will probably not try to
extract it, as it is not in a placa that
will cause Hall any trouble.
The row occurred because Hall ac
costed Mrs. Frisbie, who told her hus
band. Hall was drunk at the time, and
made a lunge at the woman, who
dodged him and found her husband.
Taking him to where Hall was she
point-d him out, whereupon Frisbie
knocked Hall down several times, beat
ing him badly, and then drawing a re
volver shot the man while he was on
the ground.
Frisbie claims self-defense and says
that he saw Hall trying to draw a re
volver. No weapon was found upon
Hall when he was searched.
Frisbie works for the East Side and
Suburban Railroad and Hall is a la
borer, who has worked at different
places in Richmond. Frisbie has only
been married a short time and his wed
ding created some surprise, for his wife
Is several years under age, and is so
small that she looks to be scarcely 14
year 3 old.

SACRAMENTO, March 7.â Senator
Belshaw rose to a question of personal
privilege this morning and roundly
scored the methods of the San Fran
cisco Examiner, which has not ex
pressed great regard for Senator Bel
â haw since he successfully carried
through his fight to re-cede the Yosem
ailey to the Federal Government.
"In this morning's Examiner," said
Senator Belshaw, "the following state
ment is made regarding me in connec
tion with mjr vote against the anti
boycott bill:"
A nM that occasioned Â«om* surprise and
not a llttl* comment was that cast by Sena
tor C. M. Belchaw of Contra Costa. Here
tofore Senator Belshaw has always votÂ«Â»d fay
- iposltlons ag&inst the labor unions,
. the Ralston bill he voted with the
unions. Belshaw's vote was explained by Sen
ator Markey, who stated that the Senator
from Contra Oosta voted against the HaJston
bill a> a trade for Marks y a vote on the Yo
ssion bill.
"Mr. Chairman," continued Belshaw,
to denounce this statement as
an absolute and malicious falsehood.
I am big enough to handle all labor
That may arise in the line
duty. Never since I have been
I Urmtn have I traded my vote
or. any measure. My vote has always
â wd my honest conviction as to
the merits of the bill In question. An
ncr representative came to me
â¢ iay and said that he had heard
another what is here printed. I
that the statement was ab
aise and he knew it to be
yet the Examiner prints this
c, actuated solely by malice. I
: rand this statement as absolute
lonsly false."

"The statement that we traded
on the measures named is false.

My vote on the Yosemite bill was the
result of my own conviction and I did
i'Ot trade In any way. The statement

SACRAMENTO, March 7.â Governor
Pardee has signed Senator Keane'a
anti-trading stamp hill and It is now
In effect. The bill had the support of
a great majority of merchants, espe

in it a direct blow at the tobacco trust,
which recently invaded San Francisco

play for public favor by establishing
a liberal system of premiums. This

however, for the bill strictly prohibits

fcelection or upon a representation, notice ad
vertisement or inducement that any property
whose selection will depend upon chance or
hazard in any manner whatsoever is to be

or imprisonment in a county Jail for not les*
than ten days nor more than six months, or

of this act shall not apply or extend in any
manner to the redemption of any such stamp,
trading stamp, coupon or other like device
that may have been Issued as & premium,
prize or premium gift, prior to the time this
act takes effect; and provided further that the
provisions of this act shall not apply or ex
tend to any sale or exchange of articles in
bulk, heap or mass or a part or portion
thereof, which sale or exchange is not made,
effected or induced by or upon any represen

WHISPERS TELL
OF A SCANDAL
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 7.â With
bated breath the Legislature awaits the
coming of the morrow. Rumors are
flying thick and fast that a second
boodle scandal Is to be exploded in the
Assembly when that house convenes
In the morning, but by whom or why
no one is willing to hazard a guesa.
The first report to gain substantial
circulation was to the effect that Grove
L. Johnson had been retained as coun
sel to present the complaint of oppon
ents of the building and loan bill, de
feated last evening In the Assembly, to
the effect that money is being used to
secure the passage of the measure.
No one has had the hardihood to sug
gest that if any money was used in
this connection it was marked.
Johnson said to-night that he had
heard of no scandal; that he had not
been retained to expose any one, but
he further remarked that he had two
sons who are lawyers and one of them
might be the Johnson connected with
the rumors,-
Another report was to the effect that
the four Senators who have been found
guilty of bribery, are going to spring a
trap on Clarence Grange and William
Corbln, building and loan men, and
that they had retained Johnson to play
this game for them.
Another report is to the effect that
proof will be offered that the prize fight
promoters who visited the city a few
days ago spread around a lot of money
where it would do the most good. This
report finds few adherents, however,
and is not given credence.
! BREACH OF PROMISE CASE
HINGES ON CONSUMPTION
SEATTLE, March 7. â Superior
Judge AlbertFon to-day decide! that
if it can be proved that consumption
is a disease transmitted from parents
to offspring a man or woman has a.
right to break a promise to marry a
person affected with it. If this can be
proved he holds that a Jury can assess
no damages against the person break
ing the marriage promise. The court
refused to decide that eonsumpti.'.n
was such a disease, regarding that as
a subject for the jury.
The decision was made in a suit
brought by Rosena E. Grover to re
rover $25,000 from Mayor Zook of
Ballard for breaking a promise to
marry her.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. MARCH S, 1905.
MARTIN KELLY
IS ARRESTED
Charged With Perjury in the
Boodle Scandal and Is
Later Released on Bail
EXPEESSES SURPRISE
Says He Has Just as Good
a Case Against Accusers
as They Have Against Him j
SACRAMENTO, March 7.â Martin ]
Kelly, the veteran lobbyist, charged
with perjury in the matter of the Sena- â 
torial boodle scandal, has been arrest- ,
cd. He gave bail and his examination !
has been set for March 20, before Jus- !
tice darken. County Detective O'Neil !
went to San Francisco and brought his
prisoner to Sacramento. Arriving here, :
Kelly engaged J. B. Devine as his at- j
torney, and the prisoner was taken be- j
fore Justice J. C. March, sitting for
Justice Clarken, and gave a bond in
the sum of $3000, with William Me- |
Laughlin and Patrick Kelly of this :
city, as sureties.
Kelly was interviewed soon after his :
release from custody. He expressed ;
surprise and it appears to wound his :
feelings to learn that anybody should j
have doubted his work in connection !
with his story about the Senatorial
boodle matter.
'"I gave my recollection of what hap
pened," said Kelly, in a tone of In
jured innocence. "It is a fact that I ,
did not agree with Senator Belshaw i
and Gavin McNab about what I told J
them, but I could not help that. My
daughter's testimony before the Grand
Jury corroborated me all right. I have j
just as good ground for swearing out !
a warrant against my accusers as j
either of them has for swearing to a j
warrant against me. Judge J. B. De- !
vine appeared as my attorney at the !
hearing to fix the bonds and I expect â 
to have a couple more lawyers asso- ,
elated with Mr. Devine when the case Â«
comes on for hearing."
TO AID CATTLEMEN.
Resolution Adopted Asking for Priv-
ileges on Forest Reserve.
SACRAMENTO, March 7. â The
resolution introduced in the Assembly
by Jones of Tuolumne asking the Na
tional Government to take action
toward giving- the cattlemen some
privileges on the forest reserves of the
State was adopted by the lower house
to-day.
"Under the present system of man- !
agement of the forest reserves," said !
Jones, "a. great deal of feed Is going
to waste. If it were fed off it would
do the forest reserves no damage and ;
would help preserve them, as it would j
lcrsen the likelihood of fires springing j
from the dry grass."
JUDGE SMITH REBUKED.
SACRAMENTO, March 7.â The As
sembly committee, consisting of Mc-
Cartney, Beardslee, Burke, Lumley
and Atkinson, appointed to look into
the charges against Superior Judge
Smith of Santa Cruz County, reported
to-day in about the same vein as did
the Torrance committee. It found
against impeachment, but criticized
the Judge for some acts that it held
to be other than ethical and not con
ducive to that respect In which the
Judiciary should be held.
Prescott's Amendments Lost,
SACRAMENTO, March 7. â The As
sembly this afternoon defeated Speak
er Prescott's constitutional amend
ments providing for direct legislation
on the part of the people of the State
and those of Incorporated cities and
of counties. There were only about
two-thirds of the members present
and Prescott gave notice of a motion
for a reconsideration.
JUDGES WILL
GET MORE PAY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 7.â The Su
perior Judges of San Francisco who
may be elected In future will enjoy
salaries of $6000 a year instead of $4000.
Assemblyman McGowan's bill, making
the Increase, which is not operative in
favor of Judges in office at the time
of its passage, was signed by the Gov
ernor to-day. The bill also increases
the salaries of the future Los Angeles
and Alameda County Judges to $5000.
The Napa, Orange and San Benlto
Judges are raised to $4000.
Under a law Just passed there are
three new Judges to be appointed in
Los Angeles County and it is held by
some that they will enjoy the raise in
salary established by the McGowan
bill, and the anomalous condition of a
new Judge drawing more money than
one who has been on the bench for
years anu is performing exactly the
same duties will be created.
Governor Fardee holds that the pro

MRS. CHADWICK
WINS A POINT
CLEVELAND, March 7.â Nine wit
nesses were examined in the Chadwick
trial to-day and the defense estab
lished the fact that the claim of the
Government that Mrs. Chadwick had
no money in the Oberlin Bank at the
time of drawing checks which were
certified by Spear and Beckwith was
incorrect in two instances at least.
It was shown by the general Journal
of the bank that on November 3, 1903,
when Mrs. Chadwick received a certi
fied check for $10,000, an entry crediting
her with that amount was made on the
Journal of the bank and a deposit slip
for $10,000 was made out in her name.
The entry and the slip were in the
handwriting of Cashier Spear. Another
entry of a similar nature, amounting
to $5000, was also found. These facts
were brought out on cross-examination
by Judge Wing, counsel for Mrs. Chad
wick, after long and tedious question-
Ing of H. H. Avery, assistant cashier
of the Oberlin Bank. Avery at first
testified that Mrs. Chadwick at no time
had either money in or credit at the
bank.
It is doubtfu 1 If Andrew Carnegie
will take the stand. District Attorney
Sullivan said this evening:
"It Is not my present intention to

needed in rebuttal of something intro
duced by the defense."
vision of the bill that the raise shall

bers of the bench enjoying the increase.
The Assembly this afternoon took an
important step toward raising the sal
aries of the State officers. It passed
McCartney's constitutional amendment
providing that the salary of the Gov
ernor shall be raised from $6000 to
$10,000 a year, the Attorney General
from $3000 to $6000 and those of all the
rest of the State officials connected with ]
the executive department and the Su
perintendent of Public Instruction from
$3000 to $5000. McCartney said it had
been recognized for years that the
State officials were receiving salarie*

stations demand.

"LA BOHEME"
DELIGHTS AT
THE COLUMBIA
A "La Boheme" flooded with youth,
buoyant, gay, sparkling, was done by
the Savage Opera Company last night.
It aroused even the Columbia audience
â and one not too large at that â to
something distinctly resembling en
thusiasm. One has never seen a bad
"Boheme"; they are only good and
better. Last night's, from the ensemble
viewpoint, was one of the best I re
member here, and I haven't missed
any. The scene at the Cafe Momus
was brilliantly handled, with its
throbbing moving crowd of grisettes
and artists, peddlers, gamins, gen
darmes, waiters â the most complete
and vivid picture of a Latin quarter
street fair that any company has pre
sented here. The soldier scene was cut,
unfortunately â and missed â but the
rest was most admirably enacted.
Reginald Roberts was the Rudolph
and again a picturesque personality
and notably sufficient on the vocal
side. It is quite Mr. Roberts' fault that
his upper C is not quite so sure as It
might be. He has the note handsome
ly within reach, but reaches a little
timidly. But he sang otherwise moat
effectively and gained warm recogni
tion. Mr. Goff as Marcel was Mr. Goft

pang and acted the painters part in
a c^ay and spirited fashion that one
had felt was rather outside his capaci

pains to make him the philosopher that

THE OAKLAND TICKET.
T'HH approaching city election in Oakland presents man}'
features that are suggestive and instructive. The leading
ticket, which will probably win, 'is that selected by the Municipal
ague. The League was an outgrowth of former political condi
:js in that city. It was found necessary to improve the quality
the local government. The carelessness of political parties in
making nominations and the influence of the local push combined
produce a government that was undesirable. After a long trial
c methods it was determined to make an organization,
n-partisan in its character and membership, that would under
ke the work of a frank and full examination of the quality of can
iates nominated by the various parties and from the material pre
yed by the party conventions select that which stood the test,
hen the League found nominated, for the same office, candi
dates equally objectionable did it name a candidate of its own.
The influence of the League immediately became strong enough
:he whole vote of the best citizens upon the ticket which
When this occurred the political parties began to com
pete with each other in making nominations that would command
the indorsement of the League. In order to do this there was imme
diately developed on the part of all citizens interested in good gov
ment a more active attention to the party primaries, in order to
make sure of the nomination of candidates who could go before the
people with the League's indorsement.
This process has finally worked out in the two leading parties
in thai city practically nominating the same ticket, as was done two
years ago and has been done now. Therefore the present ticket is
macie of candidates chosen and nominated by the Municipal League,
and it is believtd to be a ticket that deserves and will receive the
sir if] the best citizens of the city. It will be observed that
the process followed is practically that of passing the ticket through
<-cted electors. The first set. the delegates chosen at
the party primaries, make the first nominations. Its nominees re
ject the character of the convention. If the convention be careless,
or on a plane lower than is demanded by the best citizenship, its
â¢^iinees will not get the Municipal League indorsement and their
chance of election is impaired. As candidates want to win. a con
ptioa that is below grade iÂ« likely to find no one on its own plane
line to lake its nominations, in the face of sure defeat. Therefore
entkra created by the political push finds itself with nothing
onlefS it did 5< higher than its source and make nom
inations that are fit. and will command the League indorsement. The
methods of the Municipal League have reached perfection in the
present campaign. The League has been impartial in its indorse
and while its reasons are not made public, the propriety of
it 1 - ns is apparent to all thoughtful people.
The effect an influence in municipal politics is far
ft works forward into a betterment of government and
backward into a betterment of parties, and it secures a city govern
ment that owes allegiance only to the best citizenship. It is an in
fluence exterior and superior to party politics, that is exerted by a
ly of rm do not form themselves into a political party at
all. Their position i* advisory and admonitory only.
This system seems to have the capacity to reform municipal
ernment anywhere, by reforming and refining all essential party
pr pom the primary on to the ballot-box. As municipal gov
ernment in our large cities has been written up by all observers as
the odium of popular government, any simple and therefore powerful
method thst will effect reform is desirable. Of course all organiza
i. no matter how elevated its purpose nor how careful its tests
membership, is apt to become the instrument of abuses. But such
an organization as this is far easier purged of the influences which
ahnse its power and functions than are political parties in large
?Â« it limits its function strictly to securing character
and fitness in T he personnel of a city ticket, its influence will survive,
wakened, the occasional accident of a mistake.
Tt - nt that its method is a shorter road to a proper city
government than the nomination, by bodies that %ct in the first in
stance and nominate citizens" tickets, or bolting tickets, or other
kindÂ« of tickets, for such action cannot possibly have in it the calm
snd deliberation and unprejudiced examination of the fitness
of candidates, that can be had in a permanent body of disinterested
men. always organized, alert and bent upon one purpose only.
Another consideration must not be forgotten. Such an organi
zation as Oakland's Municipal League has above it the power that
invoked it into existence, the best citizenship of the city, composed
of voters who are seeking good government only and not office for
themselves. Small in numbers, the Municipal League is in effect a
permanent committee representing that class of citizens. If there
appear in such a committee evidences of self-seeking and a tendency
to graft, it is promptly admonished by a popular reversal of its
action brought about by the power that is above it. It is immediately
jarred into position again by Â«uch admonition, when a political party
is not.
The party politician and voter who takes his cue from the old
Tippecanoe campai~" sower:
"Vote for Harrison therefore
; out > why or wherefore,"
iÂ« beneath admonition. To him "regularity" is the only seal re
quired on a candidate. After one is regularly nominated, fitness has
â¢**ssed out of focus and has no consideration at all.
LIBRARY SITE CHOSEN.
ALL San Franciscans who feel in their being the strong pulse
beat of civic ambition will rejoice to know that the new
building for the Public Library has come closer to realization
by the selection of a site, and that site a very wisely chosen one.
That act goes a long way toward the consummation of the purpose
to have a bigger and better home for the library, the completion of j
which should, and no doubt will, mark the beginning of a new era
in the intellectual advance of the community.
lefol as the Public Library has been in its present housing,
there can be no hesitation in predicting for it a swift expansion of
its power to help in all things intellectual so soon as it possesses a
more commodious and beautiful center from which to radiate the
literary influences which will be gathered there in "the best that has
been thought and said in the world." Not only will its new home
call more readers, but by its impressive bodying forth of civic power
it will inspire those readers with more ambition to profit by its
benefits and by their conduct and influence help build up that ten
dency of civic power to provide wide open opportunity for all r.oble
ambition. Moreover, on the personnel of the library corps, what an
â  iration a fine building will be to them â to be diligent in wisely
aiding the seekers after intellectual gold, to be careful, quick
thoughted, courteous, accurate, and, perhaps above all, impertur
bable, in their service of the very varied public.
Th* Pouth, too. is affording the colored people opportunity to secure
â  merit in many lines of industry. The time has not yet com*, how
- hen the South will invest the nÂ«Â»gro with the power to levy taxes and
be deride how those taxes shall be expended. The disastrous experiments of
the past are Ftill too vividly recalled. It is fully in accord with the tempera
ment of the President to find him sympathizing always with the man who is
handicapped and struggling, and he has the courage to make his convictions
known. He view* the problem sentimentally; the South must regard It from
the standpoint of contiguity and experience. As a matter of fact, the condi
tion of the colored man in the South is constantly Improving. If he wHI do

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY. MARCH *, 1005.
HOW OLD JOB
WAS SOON WON
OLD Job had objected to his son's
engagement because the girl was
college educated, and, therefore,
no account, and opposed the
son's going to college until the
boy, in self defense, had taken matters
into his own hands and gone away
without permission to work his own
way. Now old Job was sick, and the
farm was under the inadequate care
of a hired man, and all the springs
and brooks were drying up and the
cattle suffering. But the obstinate old
spirit was not broken. He now looked
up, snarling.
"A windmill agent, eh? Well, tell
him to go."
"Something's got to be done, Job.
Our man â "
"Yes, yes, I know." Old Job drew
a deep, long breath. But the horses
and cattle were needing more water;
and whatever else old Job might be,
ho loved his dumb animals, and would
do for them what he would not dream
oi doing for himself. The windmill
would be a humbug, for there was no
water in the land to feed it; but it
seemed the only thing at hand.
"Yes, something's got to be done,"
he repeated; "so you can let the man
jut in his windmill. It will be good
for the birds to build nests on if noth
ing more. And Hiram will like to
look up at it when he comes home.
But don't let it go over two hundred
dollars â that's what I offered our
neighbor for half his spring,'" grimly.
"You can let him go right to work.
Our hired man will step spryer for
seeing it start. He's like Hiram for
new-fangled things."
He watched her gather up his al
most untasted breakfast with trembl
ing- hands, an expression on her face
such as he had not seen for years. At
thr- door he called her back.
"Being it's on our own land we
ought to be willing to pay more than
I offered that rascal over the fence
for his spring," he said. "I haven't
sny idea what windmills cost, but you
can tell him he may go to three hun
dred and not a cent more. That will
satisfy you and Hiram and the hired
man, maybe. When I get out I'll sink
a well, a hundred feet deep, if need be.
If that don't bring water I'll sell and
clear out."
"Maybe you'd rather I'd see about
having a well dug instead of getting
thÂ« windmill," his wife suggested.
"Wo," ungraciously, "I'd rather at
tend to that myself. I don't believe
either one will bring water, but the
well's the more sensible. I don't want
folks to say we give up without trying
to do something."
The next day his wife announced
that the farm was being looked over
for the best place, and the day after
that a dry-looking knob at the end of
the barn was concluded to offer better
prospects for water than anywhere
else. Old Job listened in grim silence.
Thr third day he could hear the
sounds of workmen. Ten days later
one or two of these workmen seemed
to fro busy about the house, and he
wondered what they could be doing.
But his obstinacy would not let him
ask questions.
It was? nearly two weeks after this
when his wife came into the bedroom
om- day, her eyes shining.
"If? done. Job." she said, her voice
r : uavering a little with the very joy of
the Dews, and it's all come out so
BE WHAT MOTHER THINKS YOU ARE.

COQUELIN'S WIT WON THE DAY.

and the most famous of its members is
the great actor Coquelin, pere, but the
Ftory ol liis election has not yet been

Price in Success Magazine.
He was present, one night, at the
club's late supper, a weekly feast, and.
having 1 heard that there was a vacancy
in the roll, applied for membership.
Now the only rules of the "Sub Rosa"
men are: "Think much. Write little.
Be as silent as you can." The presid
ing officer, with this last rule in mind,
answered the applicant by placing be
fore hiti a tumbler filled so full of wa

caused it to run over. Coquelin under

Old Job stared at her. "You don't

the end of the barn?" he demanded.
"Yes," tremulously, "and it's such !
nice water, fust like a spring. We've
fe'ot it piped in the barn, in three i
places, and into the house. It runs

I supposed the man would say the

did the man charge?"
"He â she didn't charge a cent. Job." j
;i littlo confusedly. "It was one pf the
neighbors. And the windmill and pip

Old Job waÂ« silent for some mm- I

OLD MORMON ASKS
FEW QUESTIONS.
To the Editor of The Call:
After re;iding your comment on
Senator Kearns' .speech about Mor
mons I feel like asking you a few
questions. Do you know what uses
all the money that is paid in tithing
by the Mormons is put to? I guess you
do not. Without trying to explain in
full, I will ask. Do the Mormons have
good church buildings, good appoint
ments of every kind, when you attend
their meetings? Do they pass the
hat? Do you hear anything about
poorly paid parsons? Do you hear
anything about church fairs and beg
ging committees trying to raise funds
to send the gospel to foreign lands?
Did you ever hear pf a poor Mormon
mother and children freezing or starv
ing to death, or even suffering? Did
you ever hear of a Mormon tramp?
Are not the Mormons acknowledged
to be an average well to do people?
Now (his is the age of finance, and
if the Mormons are satisfied with their
manner of financing, making all con
tribute, whose business is it to med
dle? D. W. JONES,

The Mardi Gras luncheon given yes
terday at the St. Francis by Mrs. Fer
nando Pflngst and Mrs. John T. Porter
vas the most elaborate affair of its
kind given in town for several years.
The carnival spirit prevailed in every
detail, favors and decoration uniquely
carrying out the Mardi Gras intent.
A miniature procession of toys repre
senting many grotesque creatures was
the feature of the center table, caus
ing much merriment. One hundred and
fifty guests were dispersed about eleven
tables under a beautiful trellis of bam
boo and smilax, from which were sus
pended red and yellow flowers, masques
and souvenirs. Each table, at which pre
sided a hostess, was ornate with spring
flouers and crystal candlesticks, whose
colored shades were partly covered by
tiny black masques, giving a unique
and fascinating effect. The hostesses,
by honor, assisting Mrs. Porter and
Mrs. Pfingst, were: Mrs. Thomas Por
tei Bishop, Mrs. A. S. Baldwin. Mrs.
Edward Houghton. Mrs. E. C Wright,
Mrs. (Jeorge Bates, Mrs. Harry Bates.
Mrs. Philip Galpin. Mrs. Linda Bryan,
Miss Laura Kim'oer. Mrs. Porter wore
a handsome gown of black chiffon silk
and point. Mrs. Pfingst presented a
stunning appearance in a rich gray silk
lace over violet silk, with knots of
violet velvet about the bodice. Her
hat. wide brimmed gray, was covered
with violets and violet plumes.
Mrs. Gertrude Atherton was the
guest of honor at a reception held yes

A NEW SUN SPOT THEORY.
To the Editor of The Call:
Just now is the great question of the
mystery of the sun spots. As I have,
taken up the study of them for my
private personal satisfaction, I think I
have a solution that will also pleas*
the public.
Allow me to briefly explain: The
earth is hollow, and a mild light
spreads throughout the interior. Ac
cumulations of winter ice are at the
north pole, at which is an opening to
the earth's center, a necessary opening
for keeping the light inside. These
immense overflows of snow or ice fall
down into or above said light. They
melt and ascend in vapor, which being
illumined below by the light gives us

Laying* of the Corner Stone
of the California Club
Gives Essayists Inspiration
PLANS ARE PLEASING
Ladies Witness Impressive
Ceremonies and Agree
That All Will Be Well
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
"Congratulations to the California
Club!" â so say every one of the five
hundred women who participated yes
terday in the services incident to lay
ing the cornerstone of the long
dreamed-of clubhouse â that famous
clubhouse that has caused so many
headaches, used up two building com
mittees and a couple of architects.
The latter, however, have both sur
vived, and the clubhouse is well on its
v.ay.
The plans of the clubhouse are said
to be highly satisfactory to all the
'r.on-kicking'" members of the club,
who, the gods be thanked, are greatly
in the majority. And thus were the
ceremonies of yesterday of intense in
terest.
The papers incident to the service
wtre read In the clubrooms, and were
as follows:
Mrs. J. J. Scoville, a paper on "The
Founders."
Dr. Amy Bowen, a summary of the
club's achievements.
Mrs. James \V. Orr, "The Future of
the Club."
It had been announced that Mrs.
Lovell White would talk upon* "The
Origin and Achievement of the Club."
but legislative work at Sacramento
caused her to remain at the scene of
battle. Mrs. White's paper was greatly
missed, as interesting details of the
club's beginning are at her fingertips.
Quite the sensation of the day was
Mre. Orr's prophecy â for such it really
was â and right cleverly was it told.
The many thrusts at the weird
idiosyncrasies of the clubwomen
were heartily enjoyed â by v those they
didn't hit. The paper was written
after the fashion of a fortune-teller's
manner of revealing the futureâ to
your home, to yourself, your club, to
your family, etc.. and there are those
Who iii Fiat that Mrs. Orr is assuredly
the possessor of "second sight." else
she never could have said so many
"really, truly things."
After the exercises were over gt the
clubrooms the members adjourned to
the building site on Clay street, near
Polk, and with simple ceremony â but
with deeÂ»> feeling â the cornerstone of.
their new home was laid. '
And thus is writ the first chapter
of the home-making of San Fran
cisco's big civic club.
And may it be happy and prosper
ous therein, and as potent a factor in
the city's development as it has been
in the past. t
BOARD OF EDUCATION
BUYS LAND FOR SCHOOL
Outbids Two Competitors and Judge
C'offey Confirms the Sale
to Chy.
Judge Coffey yesterday confirmed
the sale of a lot at the corner of Ma
son and Washington streets to the
Board of Education for the aum of
$7500. The land adjoins the Wash
ington Grammar School and will be
appropriated by it on the erection of
the new school under the bond issue.
The lot was owned by Louise <*.
Kaufmann. and there were two other
bids for the land. Both were less than
th. amount paid by the Board of Edu
cation. Robert G. Brotherton, who is
the administrator of the estate of
Louise C. Kaufmann, received a bid
from Henry L. McKnew of $7305 and
from Josephine Cockrell of $7000.
The Board of Education imme
diately sent a communication to the
Board of Supervisors apprising that
body of the purchase of the lot and j
requesting that $7500 be set aside out
of the proceeds of the sale of school
bonds to pay the purchase price.
Recommendation is also made that
another lot immediately to the west
of the lot be purchased for the Wash
ington School.
Divoreos Granted and Suits Filed.
The following divorces were grant-
Dlx; by Judge Hebbard. W. J. Baker
pround of desertion, and Joseph Sar
nik from Mary Sarntk. on the ground
of desertion: by Judge Murasky. Mor-
Itz Abramowitz from Tony Abramo

Recommends Acceptance of Bid.
The Supervisors' Printing Commit
tee yesterday recommended that the
oontract for doing the official advertis
ing be awarded to the Post Publishing
Company at 26 cents for each half
inch. The bid of the Journal of Com
merce at ZV2 cents was rejected be
cause sworn statements as to the pub
lication and circulation werÂ« not filed
Frank Gould, attorney for the Post,
explained that the bid of 15 cents of
last year wa* too low In view of the
fact that the cost of paper haa ad
vanced 40 per cent and the cost of la
bor is higher. The matter will be
taken up by the board next Monday.
Wants Property Partitioned.
Fannie A. McKinnon, one of the
heirs to the John J. McKinnon es
tate, yesterday filed a petition for a
division of the property on Post street.
near Kearny. There are several "heirs
under the will and the petition asks
that. If an equal partition cannot be
made, the estate be sold and the pro
ceeds equally apportioned. The peti
tion alleges that there are several nr
cupants on the property without pos
sessing the right to use the same.

SCHWAB'S MAN
IS PRESIDENT
Union Iron Works Finally
Dissolves All Connection
With Eule of the Scotts
FOBBYTH IS ELECTED
Two Bethlehem Men Chosen
31embers of New Board of
Directors for the Year
The first annual meeting of the
' stockholders of the Union Iron Works
since the reorganization and the final
; disappearance of the connection with
| the United States Shipbuilding Com
pany took place yesterday in the . of
fices of the works in this city. One
interesting feature of the event was
the resiznation of Henry T. Scott as
director. The Scott family, for the first
time in many years, is no longer con
nected with ,the Union Iron Works.
As was anticipated, Robert Forsyth,
who was selected by the Schwab inter
est to manage the affairs of the works,
was elected president. For a period of
twenty years Mr. Forsyth has been
prominently connected with the con
cern. In promoting the growth of the
business of the works he has been a
very important factor.
George Fredricks was elected vice
president; E. M. Mcllvain. secretary
and assistant treasurer; Henry S. Sny
der. treasurer and assistant secretary.
These are all members of the board of
directors. The other elected members
of the board are Charles N. Champion,
Hugh Blackmann and A. E. Foster.
The directors are all San Francisco
men with the exception of Messrs. Xc-
Ilvain and Snyder, who are from
Bethlehem, Perm., the headquarters of
the great steel plant controlled by
Schwab.
At the close of the meeting President
Forsyth and Vice President Fredricks
talked freely about the future opera
tions of the Union Ir"on Works plant.
I Vice President Fredricks said that he
anticipated that many ships will be
i constructed at the Union Iron Works.
i "That will be good for the company
and also of benefit to the city and
port."
Reports were received by the stock
holders from the old board of officers.
The connection with the old United
States Shipbuilding Company, the re
organization and the sale of the works
at auction in this city are well known
to all. The Union Iron Works are now
entirely under the new management.
According to Vice President Fredricks
the administration is completely vested
In President Forsyth, who is given
discretion in all matters of an execu
tive nature.

Letola. carrying 101 puurds, with still a
firm grip on the public's affections, had
first call in the ring. Andrew B. Cook
leceived backing and the odds about
Arabo, which horse was shouldering

David Boland had been an absentee,
the big end of tfce purse would prob
ably have gone to Andrew B. I
The three-year-old made the bush

CARS RUN OVER LITTLE
DAVID PAUKER, A NEWSBOY
Desire of Lad to Sell His Wares Re-
suits in Accident Which May
End in Death.
David Pauker, a 12-year-old news
boy, was run over and probably fatally
injured last night by a Geary-street
car at the junction of Kearny. The
accident took place shortly before 6
o'clock, when the streets were
crowded. Young Pauker was yelling
his wares on the corner, and catching
the eye of a customer on the opposite
side of the street ran across. He at
tempted to cross in front of the mov
ing cable car, but misjudged the dis
tance. The heavy vehicle struck him
forcibly and the lad was borne under
the heavy fender of the dummy.
Dr. Millar, who treated the boy at
the Central Emergency Hospital, says
that his chances for recovery are
slight. The boy was injured internally
and terribly contused and torn.
Pauker's father is Michael Pauker,
a cabinet maker, of 1055 Howard
street.
Texas Steer Makes a Hit.
One of the most decided hits ever
scared by a stock company in this city
occurred last evening at the Central,
where Hoyt's delightful farce comedy,
"A Texas Steer," was revived with all
its usual crispness and splendid scenic
investiture. A large audience wit
nessed the performance and gave
vent to their feelings by frequent out
bursts of applause.
There is no better satire on political
life than this clever skit. In the title
role Herschel Mayall gave further
evidence of the versatility that stamps
him as one of the most talented lead
ing men in the West
TURF MAGNATES
ARE SUSPENDED
Respess, Corrigan, McDowell
and Brown Blacklisted
by Western Jockey Club
BACING OUTLOOK BAD
Opinion Expressed That All
Tracks in the Vicinity of
Chicago Will Be Closed
CHICAGO. March 7. â The Dally
News to-night presents the following:
Ed Corrigan. Rome Respesa, T. C.
McDowell and Captain S. S. Brown,
all prominent on the Western turf,
were blacklisted at a meeting of the
Western Jockey Club stewards last
night, according to an unofficial state
ment made by one of the officials of
the former body to-day.
It is said the stewards decided to
withhold this information from the
general public when the reports of
the meeting were issued last night. At
that time a list of trainers, Jockeys
and other turfmen ruled against or in
favor of was officially given out. By
refraining from a public ruling and
by letting their sentiment against
these turfmen get out the jockey club
may avoid future trouble in case the
Corrigan forces take the matter to
the courts.
The ruling means that none of the
men mentioned, all owners of big
stables and of well-known horses, will
be allowed to race on Western Jockey
Club tracks this summer. It means,
too, that if the big tracks here follow
the Jockey Club dates allotted to
them, that the so-called outlaws will
be compelled to lie idle fully half the
season, while the Harlem meeting and
possibly the Worth meeting also is on.
This ia'a ruling which will work both
ways, however, and bigger purses will
need to be offered to hold the horse
men, it Is thought.
The general opinion among horse
men in Chicago is that this summer
Chicago will see a return of the Gar
fleld Park incident of twelve years
ago and that all the tracks in the vi
cinity of the city will be compelled to
close their gates.
MRS. EVYLYN LEVY FINISHES
TESTIFYING IN YOELL CASE
Very Little Testimony of Benefit to
Contestants Elicited in Re-Cross
Examination of Daughter.
Mrs. Evylyn Amelia Levy, the first
daughter of J. Alexander Yoell. over
whose estate many heirs are fighting,
again took the stand yesterday morn
ing in Judge Kerrigan's court. She
was nrst questioned in redirect ex
amination by her attorney, D. M. Dei
mas. who dwelt with particular at
tention on the location of deeds for
the San Francisco and San Jose prop
erty.
Later in the morning session the
witness was taken in hand by Attor
ney Hoerter for the contestants, who
made her describe in detail the dis
posal of the two deeds. Sh-i also \v;i3
made to repeat her testimony regard
ing the alleged dishonesty of John
Kiiy. Dr. Albert Abrams was called
Hiid In answer to a hypothetical ques
tion testified that Yoell was not suf
fering irom senile dementia prior to
his death.
Dr. Abrams continued on thÂ» stand

UNIMPORTANT WITNESSES
TESTIFY IX WITTMAN CASE
Prosecution Is About to Close and
Defense Will Bring in Its Evi
dence Soon.
Scarcely any of the evidence ad
duced at the trial of Chief of Police
Wittman before the Board of Police
Commissioners last night was detri
mental to the Chief's case. Watch
men, plumbers, tax collectors, inspec
tors for the Board of Health, real es
tate men and contractors were called
to prove that gambling had been sup
pressed in Chinatown since Decem
ber 1, but some of the witnesses con
fessed that they were not well in
formed as to such affairs in the dis
trict.
H. E. Babin, a real estate man, tes
tified that many of the clubs had been
closed since Cook assumed duty in
Chinatown and that many had been
abandoned by their proprietors. Ba
bin did not know who conducted the
clubs, as he collected his rents
through the wickets at the end of
each month and asked no Questions.
Patrolmen R. R. O'Brien and Hen
ry Heinz, members of Ellis' squad, ad
mitted that Wittman's orders were to
suppress gambling, but on the advice
of their attorney they refused to say
whether they did their best to do so
or not. Sergeant Ellis was called tc
the stand, but gave no testimony. The
trial will be resumed this evening at
9 o'clock and It is expected the de
fense will begin the introduction of
testimony on Thursday night.
CONTINUE ARGUMENTS OX
THE EPPINGERS' MOTION
Arguments on the motion to set
aside the indictments charging: Her- |
man, Jacob and Josua Epplnger and \
James Demings with obtaining money ,
by false pretenses were continued be- I
fore Judge Lawlor yesterday after- ,
noon. The chief grounds of the mo- i
tion are that the grand jurors who
brought in indictments were biased.
Ex-Oovernor Budd occupied the at
tention of the court all afternoon. He I
argued that bias and prejudice had
been shown in the testimony of Grand
Jurors Andrew M. Davis, George A.
Newhall and James B. Smith. Davis
was a member of the Merchants' As
sociation; Newhall had admitted that
he had expressed an opinion to friends
about the defendants at the time of
their failure, and Smith had been a
grand juror at the time the first in
dictments against Herman and Jacob
Eppinger had been filed, which clearly
disqualified him. He contended that
Smith had said on the witness stand '
that he believed in the guilt of the
defendants. Assistant District Attor
ney Ferral denied that Smith made
such a statement and the court stenog
rapher was asked to have Smith's
testimony transcribed by this morning
BASEBALL MEN
AGREE QUICKLY
Pacific Coast Officials Take
a Decided Stand on the
Question of Drafting
3IAJOES MFST SUB3IIT
Big Leagues Allowed to
Take but One Player and
at an Increased Price
ThÂ« Pacific Coast Baseball League
fell into line last night with the other
leagues In the National Association
and unless the American and the Na
tional leagues recede from a stand
which is pronounced arbitrary and un
just another baseball war is Imminent.
Under the rule now in vogue the two
major leagues may draft two players
from a club paying $750 for each man.
The minor leagues insist that only one
man may be drafted and * that $1500
must be paid for his release. The Na
tional League officials are said to be
willing: to have this rule go into effect
but the American League is holding
out. If the latter does not agree a
baseball war will result.
The action of the Pacific Coast offi
cials at the meeting held last night
In. President's Bert's office makes the
position of the minor leagues a strong
cne, as this was the last link required to
make the chain complete. The action
was practically unanimous, as five out
of the six coast clubs were represented,
no other business was transacted, this
being the special purpose of the meet
ing.
BE SURE AND TAKE THE
CHILDREN TO THE CIRCUS
Norris and Rowe Show at Mechanics'
Pavilion Has Everything to
Delight Young and Old.
The greater Norris and Rowe show
at the Mechanics' Pavilion is doing a
tremendous business. Already, for six
performances, the indoor circus has
delighted some 32,000 people. The
show runs all the rest of the weelc.
Sunday night being the last perform
ance.
The huge hall was crowded to its
utmost capacity last night. From the
beginning of the show to the finish the
audience sat mystified at the marvel
ous feats of the trained horses, ele
phants, camels, birds, monkeys and
dogs. The acrobats, trapeze per
formers and bare-back riders came in
for round after round of deafening ap
plause, to say nothing of the children's
favorites, the clowns, who by their
funny antics and witty sayings caused
many little boys and girls to burst into
laughter.
The pavilion is well lighted and
every seat is a good one. Not a child
in San Francisco should miss this
show, the best the city has seen for
ytars. Norris and Rowe deserve credit
for the excellent manner in which the
acts are conducted.

of the town will be thoroughly organ
ized before that time. The general
talk in the Republican ranks is favor
able to a high grade party convention
and to the nomination of a Republi
can ticket of such exceptional worth
that the independent voters will be
impelled to support it.
The merits of such men as Charles
W. Slack, Sheldon G. Kellogg and
Charles A. Murdock are already dis
cussed. In 1901 and again in 1903
Judge Slack could have had the nom
ination for Mayor on the Republican
ticket if he had signified the slightest
desire to accept the position of party
leader, but all of his inclinations were
against such acceptance. He is re
garded by very many citizens, irre
spective of party affiliation, as a man
who is able to wrest the control of
municipal affairs from the hands of
grafters and graft promoters.
Sheldon Q. Keilogg has many stanch
supporters in the Republican camp. He
is spoken of as a clear-headed, inflex
ible man, who has the firmness of
character to execute the will of the
people.
Charles A. Murdock is a well
known, progressive citizen of high
character and recognized ability.
The preliminary work of organiza
tion in the several Assembly districts
will probably begin immediately after
the adjournment of the Legislature and
it would not be surprising if the Re
publican citizens of the Forty-first
should open the campaign for better
municipal government. This district
holds the record for independent exer
cise of the right of elective franchise.
The Republican majority In the Forty
first often exceeds one thousand, yet
a majority of five hundred for an ac
ceptable Democratic nominee has been
recorded. The Republicans can hold
the district and command a very large
majority by nominating a municipal
ticket of unauestioned worth.
It is foreshadowed that the Republi
cans of the Thirty-fourth. Thirty-fifth,
Thirty-sixth. Thirty-seventh. Thirty
eigth, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth, Forty
first, Forty-second, Forty-third and
Forty-fourth Assembly districts will
organize for the municipal battle
without seeking the special guid
ance of the governing body of the par
ty. The duty of fixing the apportion
ment of delegates and designating a
time for holding the convention will
devolve on the county committee, but
it does not follow that the delegates
proposed by the committeemen in the
several districts shall be entitled to
party support.
In the Fortieth District, which is
istrongly Republican, the independ
ents display remarkable voting
strength when the occasion call for
resolute work. In the Thirty-ninth
a spirit of independence prevails.
The prediction is made that the voters
in these and other districts will not
enact orders from so-called headquar
ters of the "organization" as to the
method and style of proposing dele
gates, but will come together in mass
meeting and nominate ten or twelve
delegates, or whatever number the dis
trict is entitled to under the call, and
then appeal to the best elements of
citizenship in the district for the elec
tion at the primary of such proposed
delegates.

OREGON'S FIRE
INVESTIGATED
Fr S. Supervising Inspector
Bermingham Inquires Into
Csgsefl of the Catastrophe
NO REASON ASSIGNED
Officers Say Fifty Bales of
Oakiim With Paint and
Phosphorus Were on Board
John Bermingham, United States sup
ervising Inspector of steam vessels,
began an investigation yesterday into
the flre aboard the stramer Oregon off
Crescent City on February 23. Captain
Fred Werner, Engineer Samuel Sut
ton and First Officer C. J. Boutlllier
were the witnesses examined.
The first officer's testimony, which
was corroborated by the others, was
that at about 1 o'clock in the after
noon one of the waiters saw smoke
issuing from below and raised the
alarm. Boutillier sent for the carpen
ter and had him remove a board, so
as to see where the flr-e was. The
hatches were covered up tightly and
four streams of water were turned on
with the fire hose, two In the after
hatch and two in the glory hatch.
There was no sign of smoke In the for
ward hatch. The vessel was listing
very much when she arrived near the
buoy off Crescent City. Here the
steamer Meteor was signaled and took
off the fifty-five passengers of thÂ«
Oregon.
There was one case of phosphorus
forward on the main deck. There were
also about fifty bales of oakum. There
were about fifty tons of red lead and
white lead and some mixed paint, but
no turpentine. There were five tiers
of freight forward of the oakum. The
loss to the ship was estimated at $45,
000 and to the cargo at $50,000. None
of the witnesses had any idea as to
how the flre began.
The Crescent City Transportation
Company filed a libel yesterday In the
United States District Court against
the steamer Oregon for salvage. The
value of the Oregon is stated at $175.
000 and that of her cargo at $75,000.
The salvage services are alleged to
have been rendered by the steamer Del
Norte on the occasion of the fire.

WOULD DEFEAT
THE RATE BILL
Railroads Enter Upon Plan
in California to Block
Legislation by Congress
BEGIN IX THE SOUTH
Companies Seek to Secure
the Co-operation of the
Los Angeles Business Men
LOS ANGELES, March 7.âTranspor
tation companies with interests "in
California have set on foot a move
ment designed to interest local job
bers and shippers In the proposed rail
road legislation, and to secure their
co-operation in an attempt to defeat
any law which may be introduced in
Congress which has for its object an
increase in the powers of the Inter
state Commerce Commission. Repre
sentatives of the companies have se
cured consideration of the matter by
both the Merchants' and Manufactur
ers' Association and the Produce Ex
change.
Locally, the stock argument against
the proposed Federal legislation, as
embodied in the statement* made be
fore the exchange by representatives of
the transportation companies, is that
to permit the Interstate Commerce
Commission to flx freight rates would
work a great hardship to California
shippers under the mileage system,
which, the railroad men say, undoubt
edly would be adopted.
Under this system freight tariffs
would be based directly on the length of
haul, and California, with Its 2300-mile
haul to Chicago and its more than 3000
mile haul to New York City, would,
they say, suffer accordingly, while in
termediate points would be benefited.
INSULAR JUDGE
MAN OF ACTION
ST. LOUIS. March 7.â Advices have
Just been received from Manila telling
of the exploits of Judge Adolph Wis
llzenus, formerly a Poice Court Judge
of St. Louis and now a Justice on the
island of Cebu, who in January last
personally pursued and captured an
American commercial vessel that was
leaving with three Filipino girls
forcibly detained on board, rescued the
girls and fined the captain 2500 pesos.
The ship was the barkentine Chehalis,
owned and commanded by P. M. Simp
son of Oregon. When the ship cleared
from Cebu the cry was raised that three
Filipino girls had been carried away.
A cutter overhauled the ship, but the
girls could not be found aboard. Then
Judge Wislizenus. hearing the report,
suddenly adjourned court, buckled on
a revolver, summoned armed native
officials and pursued the barkentine in
a launch, overhauling her and finding
the three girls in a locker. Captain
Simpson was brought to land, charged
with abduction, by Judge Wislizenus.
who immediately reconvened his court
and fined him 2500 pesos.
I FISHERMEN PROTEST
AGAINST JAP POACHERS
Northerners Object to Methods of
Foreigners off the Alaskan
Coast.
SEATTLE. March 7. â A protest,
supported by affidavits, has been sent
to the Department of Commerce and
Labor by influential fishermen of
Washington and Oregon, calling at
tention to the fact that Japanese fish
ermen are coming across Bering Sea
and catching salmon by the shipload
off the Alaska coast. The supply of
fish in Japan is now limited and the
demand increased by reason of the
war, so that the poachers are cutting
off a good market for the American
fishermen.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 7. â The speculation in
stocks took on rather a waiting \ attitude to
day and business was largely confined to test
ing operations to learn the temper of the
market. These failed to develop any vigorous
upward tendency and the subsequent drop was
due as much to disappointment over this fact
as to any positive pressure. The Northern
Securities decision or supposition regarding It
has figured bo long as a speculative factor
that the market is soxnewnat at a loss with
the conclusion reached. : But the apathetic
tone which Is creeping over the market evi
dences that the many combinations and mer
ger stories, none of which have- materialized,
are losing their force to snmulate demand.
The failure of the much talked of Southern
iron combination has had an admonitory ef
fect and this Is regarded as showing the
highly credulous condition of mind into which
the speculative actors had been led. A spirit
of misgiving regarding other vague stories on
the strength of which stocks have been bought
is the result. Authoritative denial was made
to-day of a recently prevailing rumor of a
new Issue of sugar stock with valuable sub- i
scription privileges. The strike of the Inter
bcrough system in New York City had no
very clear effect directly through the stocks
immediately concerned, which in fact showed
strength, but the effect was bad on the gen
eral speculative temper. There was a direct
effect also in the reduction of the attend
ance at the Stock Exchange caused by the
difficulty in getting to business, and the
resultant dullness of the market was partly
due to this fact.
There wan no change in current conditions
of money or business to alt-Â»r the tone of the
stock market. Money on call continued easy.
An easier tonÂ« â of London discounts â  led to
renewed exertion of a reduction in the Bank
of England rate on Thursday. But Paris was
a seller of Btocks, apparently on account of
the dark Russian outlook. The terms of the
settlement of the grain rate war was re
garded as threatening a permanent decline In
th* grain traffic to. Atlantic ports, which may
hayÂ« been a factor In the heaviness of the
trunk lines. Revived rumors of a lead mer
irer were responsible for the strength of Na
tional Lead and Smelting stocks. The few
game were roorly held and the market as a
\s-hole plainly showed the waning influence of
the unverified rumor* which have ' long served
to carry prices upward. The closing was easy
and at about the lowest of the day.
! Bonds were heavy. Total sales, par value,
I $3,000,000. Â»
United States bonds were all unchanged on
1 call. . â¢

CHICAGO, March 7.â At the opening the j
wheat market showed considerable . weakness, ;
May being off % to } s c at $1 14% to $1 15Vi. !
July was down V* to %c at 97% to 98V4c. The '
Initial . decline was due partly to a slump of '
% pence at Liverpool. The. weakness abroad,
however, ' was a , less influence than the do
mestic condition. . The weather throughout the
winter wheat section of the United States was â 
extremely favorable to ,tlÂ« development of j
the new crop, a rise in . temperature accom- ,
panled by rains being reported from many lo- 1
calities, in addition to the selling by pit trad- . 1
en commission i houses had numerous . stop- '
loss orders. After selling at $1 15% shortly
after the opening. May gradually de^.i.nd untt! â 
the price touched. $1 13%. July sold oil to ;
BO%c. Later May -, rallied yon covering by j
shorts, but July was heavy the entire, day. A (
factor that tended to create â¢ c ime demand Jar .
May was a report by a Io?al crop statlstiilan. [
The statistics eiven by the expert makod the

time of year. The market closed weak with
May at $1 14% and July at 'M%c. : ;

Potatoes. Onions and Vegetables. j
i The Potato market Is liberally supplied with }
cheap Burbanka. ' but there a scarcity. of "
strictly fancy stock and smooth bright offerings t
of all descriptions pass out of receivers' hands
as quickly as they come In. Oregon Burbanks }
were 5c per cental higher yesterday, the ad- >
vance being obtained for several lots of, fancy .
stock from the Coos Bay region. Onions were J
higher at $:; 50 per cental, two freshly ar- j '
rived carloads being closely' sold out at that
figure. A ; carload of Sweets was at hand. ' but *
sold slowly owing to the poor quality of the !
stock. New Potatoes from Nllea brought 3 %c I -
per pound. |
Receipts of Asparagus were over 1400 boxes [
and. '-, as there was no demand for shipment, '
prices declined sharply. The' canners were i
offering $2. per box for No. 1, but were unable!
to 'secure sufficient stock . to .warrant : starting J
packing operations. Prices of Rhubarb had a ]
wider.; range, the Growers' Association having
reduced . the . price ;of standard to $1 per box, ,

were firm, with .-' the . exception of â  Tomatoes, 1 , .

There was a good demand for all grades of
Oranges and sound ' offerings met with prompt

small percentage of the available supplies were

shape, and as It , rots down quickly it has to

In quotations. Trade in other citrus kinds Is .of
fair volume, but stocks of an descriptions are
more '. than , sufficient for requirements. Tan

SCHMITZ FAILS
TO OEST BAEHR
Auditor Does Not Comply
AVith Demand That Grand
Jury Expenses Be Repaid
MAYOR PROCRASTINATES
Leaves Office After Repeat
ing- His Previous Threat
to Suspend City Official
Mayor Schmitz sent word yester
day morning to Auditor Baehr notify
ing that official that if the money
paid for Â«|rar.d Jury expenses was not
. repaid by 1:30 o'clock in the afternoon
he would make out his order suspend
ing Baehr from office.
Baehr was not in his office when
the message was delivered, and when
he arrived the Mayor had left the City
Hall. Baehr waited all afternoon
for tli* Mayor to come back and make
his next move, and did not leave his
"office until i p. m.. up to which time
Schmitz had not put in an appearance.
Meanwhile Baehr-. did not make
good the demands he audited for
Grand Jury expenses, nor does he in
ten'" to do so. It is said that the
Mayor is relenting in view of the
fact that Baehr has paid the demands
of certain non-civil service employes
in the laboratory and food depart
ments of the Health Board and will
not press Baehr's suspension very
hard. He will in all likelihood sus
pend Baehr, but the suspension will be
of no effect, as it is not likely that the
Board of Supervisors .ill ratify the
order, am the Mayor admitted in his
first letter to Baehr. The charter re-
Qttires an affirmative vote of not less
than fourteen Supervisors to make the
Mayor's suspension of a public officer
equivalent to a removal. It is doubt
ful if more than three Supervisors will
FUind by the Mayor for political rea
sons on so grave a matter as the re
moval of a city official. Therefore
the Mayor action, not being approved.
th*> suspended officer would be imme
diately reinstated.

ANOTHER WONDERFUL
CURE BY CUTICURA
â 
Writing under date of Sept. 7, 1904,
Mrs. Mattie Shaffer, of Cumberland,
Miss., says: "Some time ago I or-
dered and received your wonderful
Cuticura Remedies, which 'I used on j
my little afflicted babe with wonder- j
ful results. I had tried many other 1
remedies without any benefit what-
ever, and Cuticura came to the rescue
â¢when my doctors and all other rem-
edies had failed. One doctor pro-
nouncednt scrofula, the other eczema.
. The little one was one solid Bore, with j
scales and scabs from head to foot,
when I started using Cuticura Soap
and Ointment. The result was won* '
derful, and now my baby's face and
body are smooth and clear." . ,

THE DUTY OF MOTHERS
At the First Sign of Disfiguring
Humors Is to Use Cuticura.
Every child born into the world
with an inherited tendency to tortur-
ing, disfiguring humors of the Skin '
and Scalp, becomes an object of the j
most tender solicitude, not only be- 1
cause of its suffering, but because of
' the dreadful fear that the disfiguration
is to be lifelong and mar its future
happiness and prosperity. Hence it
becomes the duty*of mothers of such I
afflicted children to acquaint them-
selves with the best, the purest, and j
most effective treatment available, i
viz.: the C'v.tirura Treatment, consist- !
ing of warm baths with Cuticura Soap, 1
and gentle anointings with Cuticura '
Ointment, the great Skin Cure. Cures .
made in childhood are speedy, per- ;

JUDGE MOGAN SPURNS
COBBLER'S PLEA.
Repairer of Footgear Denies
He Shot Butcher With Pepper
PRACTICAL TEST WEAKENS DEFENSE
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
William Severino, whose shoemaking
fstablishment is at 1903 Bush 6tre^t,
asserted it was Â«oapstone he accident
ally squirted from an air-pistol into the
eyes of Sigmund Guss, butcher. With
equal positiveness Mr. Guss declared
that the ammunition was red pepper;
also, that its discharge was not acci
dental. Which left to Police Judge
Mogan the task of determining which
Of the statements was entitled to most,
credence.
"Perhaps. ' suggested his Honor, "
we were given a practical demonstra
tion of the manner in which the shoot
ing was done we might be aided in ar
riving at a jU6t decision. Is the â ah â
ah â weapon in court?"
To the bench was passed for inspec
tion a wooden contrivance with rubber
bulb attached. It was a less danger
ous looking article than Mr. Guss'
testimony indicated, but the Judge
handled it gingerly.
"If your Honor, will kindly submit
t" the test." said counsel for the de
fense. "I will press the bulb and pro
ject some of the contents of the tube
into your eyes. It may not be amiss
to state beforehand that since the pis
tol was accidentally discharged by my
client in the complainant's presence
it has not been tampered with in any
way. and still contains some of the
soapstone with which it was loaded at
that time."
Despite this assurance of the innoou
ousness of the charge the Court de
clined to serve as a target, an honor
which was turned aside by Prosecuting
Attorney Greeley also. Then the Ad
vocate for the defense placed Mr. Sev
erino against the wall and pinned him
there with onÂ« hand while with the
other he pressed the bulb, held within
about three feet <">f his captive's face,
and ejected from the tube a whitish
cloud. It was suggested that he fire
at closer range, as the shot had struck
Mr. Severino squarely on the chest,
and when the suggestion was adopted
Mr. Severino bobbed his head and shut
his eyes, receiving the charge on his
brow. The Court pronounced the ex
periment unconvincing.
Asked to explain why he had shot
Mr. Guss for any reason, Mr. Sever
ino stated that he had loaned an awl
t<> the butcher's apprentice, who neg
lected t" return it, and when hr- 'Mr.
Beverino) went to recover his property
he was treated in an intimidatory man
ner by Mr. Guss. who had a broom in
his hand. "And as I was going out, to
avoid trouble," Mr. Severino contin
ued, "my hand accidentally dropped
into a side pocket of my working coat
and was accidentally withdrawn with
the Run which accidentally went off."
"Th*>HÂ» will be nothing accidental
nbout your sentence one week from to
day." said the Judge to Mr. Severino.
i Mamoth Hastens . pleaded that he
< had; a "dream hunch" on a certain
; horse race at Emeryville last Monday,
5 but : was- unable to utilize it to his
I pecuniary advantage, inasmuch as he
, had no money to bet with. His cer
tainty of winning was enhanced, he
j said, by receipt of reliable information
. that the famous Miquf Scanlon Syn-
I dicate was heavily .backing his favorite
ito bring home the dinero. ' So in des
peration he visited three different gun
! stores and rented from each of them
a rifle, his total outlay being three dol
lars and his purpose to pawn the
weapons for as much lucre as he could
obtain and then wager every penny of
it on Sunny Shore. . The pawning was
â  uninterrupted, but before he could
place his money in the hands of book
makers he was arrested and charged
with larceny by a detective who had
recognized him as an ex-convict and
naturally, was suspicious that he did
not become honestly possessed of so
many firearms. If the arrest had been
delayed a little while, Mr. Hastens af
firmed, he would have redeemed the
guns and restored them to their re
spective owners, because the closing
odds against Sunny Shore to win were
15 to 1, and the horse fairly breezed
home. Judge Cabaniss will learn
something more of Mr. Kasten's career
to-day, his promised informants be
ing members of the police force.

"1 came from Nevada an' I don't
Tke your town!" yelled Henry John
son, drunk and truculent, as he started
to break things in a saloon at Haight
and Stanyan streets. Patrolman Ceiner
responded to the bartender's call for
aid, and to him the man fromÂ«Ne
\ada addressed language that was too
lurid for transcription.
Judge Mogan had pronounced Mr.
Johnson guilty of peace disturbance
and commanded him to appear for
sentence to-day when there ascended
to the bench a whisper to the effect
that in his vituperative abuse of San
Francisco the Xevadan had cast un-
just aspersions upon the character of
the entire feminine portion of the
community, said libelous utterances
having been launched in presence of
ar. innkeeper who could be produced
in court if wanted.
"He is wanted," said the Judge,
"and If he swears in accordance with
what he has told these witnesses, you,
Mr. Johnson, might as well write to
your friends in the Sagebrush State
that you will not be able to rejoin
them for Quite an extended period.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. MARCH 8, 1905
owing to circumstances which you are
unable to control."
A. L. Xesbitt, who was drunk last
Monday when he appeared in Depart
ment No. 1 as a complaining witness,
was both sober and eorry when he
entered the same tribunal yesterday
morning, for he had spent the preced
ing twenty-four hours in custody and
vas charged with contempt. He had
accused W. H. Wheeler of robbing him
of $20 In a Fifth-street saloon, but
withdrew the charge and said he did
not know who stole his money.
"I have been a soldier in the Philip
pines," he explained, "and like every
other white man who has lived there
I am unable to moderately drink and
retain my senses. If this man says
hr- didn't take oiy $20. I can't prove
that he did. because I don't remember
a thing about losing it."
So the charge against Mr. Wheeler
was dismissed and the contempt
charge against Mr. Nesbltt will be
heard to-day.
Suspecting that Chris Karsten, gro
cer at Sutter and Leavenworth streets,
was illegally selling liquor in pack
ages to inmates of the fashionable
apartment houses with which the
neighborhood is thickly studded, Pa
trolman Mitchell engaged a messenger |
boy to serve him as a decoy and, if
possible obtain evidence sufficient to
convict. The youth was instructed to
tell the grocer that he had been sent
to purchase a flask of whisky by a lady
residing at the Empire Hotel, and to
insist on being given only the very i
finest tipple, as his employer # was suf
ficiently opulent to consider quality
rather than cost. The instruction was
faithfully and shrewdly obeyed, the j
boy paying his money and receiving in !
exchange a bottle of "skee" that would j
convey complete comfort to a connois
seur. Then the arrest was made.

defense next Tuesday.
In the day* of his officialism, when
he operated an elevator in the Hall of
Justice, there was nothing in the gen
eral conduct of Robert Â»E. Campbell
with which any reasonable person
could find fault; but no sooner did he
retire from the service of the mu
nicipality than his behavior became
annoying to his friends and bother
some to the police. The latter say that
he imbibed strong waters with such
recklessness as to acquire for himself
the reputation of a "soak," and that
while under the influence of excess al
cohol he did things that provoked his
arrest. It was one of those things
that Judge Mogan heard about yester
day.
At one of the corners of Hyde and
Jackson streets, his Honor was in
formed, ther* Ix a grocery, and for
some reason which did not come to
light Mr. Campbell stocked himself
with eggs of undecided age and empty'
tomato cans and fiercely bombarded
thp walls and windows of the estab
lishment until his ammunition was ex
hausted. Incidental to the siege of the
grocery Dr. Bohn of 1551 Hyde street
was struck on the jaw with a hurtling
tomato can, and he still thinks the
member is fractured. The doctor just
happened to be passing by the grocery
when the bombardment opened, and he ,
was unable to escape from the zone of !
fire ere the tin missile hit him.
Mr. Campbell pleaded inability to tell
why he attacked the grocery, but dis
claimed intent to injure Dr. Bohn,
against whom he entertained no hard
feeling whatsoever â indeed did not
know him â and the court therefore
might safely nut down the injury to
the doctor as an unfortunate accident.
But the court did no such thing. It
pronounced Mr. Campbell guilty of
battery and ordered him to appear for
sentence this morning, an order which
is likely to be obeyed, inasmuch as Mr.
Campbell remained in custody.

WOMAN BURGLAR
GETS FREEDOM
Mrs. Grace Squires Allowed
to Go on Probation for
. Four Years by Judge Cook
THINKS ACT IS INVALID
Requests District Attorney
to Take an Appeal to Su
preme Cour^ to Test Point
Mrs. Grace Squires, the woman burg
lar, was allowed to go on probation by
Judge Cook yesterday. As the Judge
is not satisfied as to the validity of the
act passed by the Legislature he asked
the District Attorney to take an ap
peal to the Supreme Court to test the
point.
The defendant was convicted on one
charge of burglary for entering the
loom of Mrs. Verlie Campbell at 153
Turk street, and pleaded guilty to an
other charge of entering the residence
of Peter Hoy, jeweler, on Laguna
street. On the first charge the Judge
suspended sentence for four years and
appointed Miss Sarah Fry as proba
tionary officer,, He made it a condi
tion that the defendant return to her
home near Dbwnieville and remain
there with her husband and daughter.
"If the act is valid," said the Judge,
"this is a case calling for the exercise
of the right to allow the defendant to
go on probation. I am not satisfied,
however, of the validity of the act, and
as the District Attorney could not take
an appeal to the Supreme Court to
have the question determined unless
judgment is passed I will pass sen
tence on her on the charge to which
she pleaded guilty."
The Judge ordered the defendant to
be confined in San Quentin for a period
of six months. He then made an order
suspending sentence for four years as
in the other case, and asked the Dis
trict Attorney to take an appeal to the
Supreme Court, which will be done as
speedily as possible. After the papers
were signed the defendant left the
courtroom with Miss Fry and her at
torney, Walter Gallagher.
MUSICAL TRIBUTE
TO SAN FRANCISCO
This City to Become One
of the Art Centers of the
World, Says Tetrazzini
Never was San Francisco more highly :
complimented, in a musical way, than
by the great Tetrazzini after her recep
tion at the Palace Hotel two evenings
ago.
The name of San Francisco as a musi
cal < ity is growing rapidly and Tetraz- m
zini has become a warm admirer of Call-*
fornia and Californians.
These are the words of the famous so
prano:
"ft was certainly a beautiful reception
which was tendered me last evening at
the Palace Hotel and it will ever remain
a bright spot in my artistic career.
"M lias been a very great surprise and
pleasure to find so many enthusiastic
patrons of art in San Francisco, and to
be entertained by so generous a host as
Colonel Kirkpatrick.
"And never will I forget the beautiful
tone of the Kohler & Chase Grand piano
upon which my accompaniments were
played; it was an inspiration.
"'I shall take away with me the most
pleasant memories of these wonderful â 
Instruments and the .generous hospitality
and warm sympathy^ of the Californians
themselves.
"I think San Francisco will surely be
come one of the great art centers of the
world." i

CITY TO HAVE
BIG REVIVAL
"I don't know but what the revival
began to-day," said the Rev. Dr.
George C. Adams last night at the
close of one of the most remarkable in
terdenominational meetings which the
city has seen.
The noted evangelists who are hold
ir- forth in Oakland came across the
bay to San Francisco and early yester
day morning began a conference at the
Central Methodist Episcopal Church at
which were pastors of all the evangeli
cal churches of the city. The Rev. H.
H. Bell, D. D.. in the absence of Bishop
Hamilton, who is chairman of the
Evangelistic Union of San Francisco,
presided and reading the letters from
the various Protestant denominations
acquiescing in the plans to hold re
vivals next autumn said that the Right
Rev. Bishop William Ford Nichols had
written that while he could not commit
the various rectors of the Episcopal
church to activity in such a campaign
he wi.-ihed it understood that his sym
pathies wer- 1 with them and his prayw
would be for them.
Then came the report of the nomina
tion committee with important recom
mendations as follows:
To â¢ the -Conference on Evangelistic Cam
paign: â â¢â¢ Your .committee ron nomination met
with- the following persons present; Rev. A.
C Bane Bey. F. M. Larkin. Ph. D. ; Rev.
John HemphUl. D.D.; Rec. W. C Pond. D.D.;
Rev William Radcr. Rev. William Kirk Guth
rle mvVJ.K.. White. Â\. Â» 4U #Â»t
On motion it was recommended that the fol
lowing be the executive committee of the evan
gelistic campaign: , Rev. George C. Adams,
D D. Congreirattonallst; Rev. George W.
White D.D., Methodist: Rev. , John â¢ Hemp
hill D.D.. Presbyterian; . Rev. H. H. Bell.
D.D.. United Presbyterian; Rev. L. J. Sawyer.
Baptist; Rev. E. Nelander. .â  Ph. D.. Luther
an.; Rev A. A. Burletgh, African Methodist,
and Rev.' Walter M. White, D.D.. Christian
ChUr< Asks FOR DR. CHAPMAN.
Further recommended that through Dr.
Samuel Macintosh we request the evangeWtlc
committee of the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian church to grant to uÂ» the service*
of Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman for an evangelistic
campaign in San Francisco during the fall of
1908 A. C. BANE. Chairman.
J. E. WHITE. Secretary.
San Francisco. March ti. 1906.
The report and the recommendations
were unanimously adopted.
The meeting then adjourned to the
Young Men's Christian Association,
where a noon-day service was held for
"busy men and women." The auditor
ium was filled and on the platform
were: Dr. Wilbur Chapman, the world
famed evangelist; President John Sam
uel Macintosh of the San Francisco
Theological Seminary, San Anselmo;
Evangelists Henry Ostrom, R. A. Wal
ton. John H. Elliott. Rev. Charles
Stelzle; Henry J. McCoy, general secre
tary of the Young Men's Christian As
sociation; the Rev. Horace Day of Los
Angeles, the Rev. Dr. Coyle of Denver;
the Rev. J. H. Thompson of Christ
Church New Zealand; Dr. H. H. Bell,
the Rev. Walter M. White, the Rev.
Dr. John Hemphill. the Rev. W. E.
Biederwolf, who came specially from
San Diego to attend the one-day con
ference, and other 'clergymen.
Dr. Chapman roused his hearers with
an exhortation for the habit of prayer
In the course of which he said that
when men preached they moved men
and when men prayed they moved God.
SWEEPS LIKE MIGHTY FIRE.
The Rev. Mr. Day,, speaking of the
evangelistic movement in America,
said that it waa sweeping like a mighty
fire along the Pacific Coast, and their
prayers would help the coming great
movement in San Francisco.
The Rev. Henry Ostrom and Dr.
Chapman spoke eloquently of the great
religious revivals in Denver. Atlanta,
Los Angeles arid other cities.
At Calvary Presbyterian Church UM
afternoon was devoted to addresses by
the evangelists. The key-note was th*
readiness of San Francisco to welcome
a revival which shall equal those
which have won souls in oth<=>r part 3
of the land.
In the evening the conference mÂ«Â»t
again at the First Congregational
Church. The fine edifice was filled.
Every one was called upon by Dr.
Robert F. Coyle to prepare for the re
vival here in the autumn. At th .-Â»
point the vast congregation
hymns under direction of the R*v.
Frank S. Ford, and it seemed â â¢Â»
though the very rafters would move
with the impassioned and triumphant
singing of the :?reat hymn "Ooward.
Christian Soldiers."
It was then that Dr. Adams said. I
don't know but what the revivu'
gan to-day."
