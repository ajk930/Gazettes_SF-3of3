EMPLOYES IN THE PARK ARE SQUEEZED
TO SWELL RUEF'S CAMPAIGN FUND.
In their desperation, Enef tribute-takers have overstepped the limit. Outrageous demands for campaign money from city employes, at
the peril of their positions, have raised a shameful scandal. SHe^mjS^Lmi^timt|^^^to Mayor and secretary of the Park Commission,

Penalty of Refusal Is Loss of.
Jobs Under Schmitz.
Of all the grafts which have been per
petrated by Mayor Schmltz, Abraham
Ruef and their lieutenants, the most glar
ing atlempt of all has Just reached the
ears of the managers of the fusion cam
paign. Through Herbert Schmitz, broth
er of the Mayor and secretary of the
Board of Park Commissioners, the word
has been passed to the 400 employes of
the park that they are to contribute a
certain share of their last month's wages
to the Schmltz campaign fund. Part of
this forced payment was made yesterday
and Monday, when the warrants for thÂ«
month of October are cashed, j Herbert
Schmitz Is to pay the warrants, accord
ing to the plan, and he Is to subtract a
certain amount from the wages of each 1
man. This money is to tie used to, swell
the great store of tribute that is to pay
the expenses of the Schmitz campaign, j
-work has been done with all the
cunning that the administration man
agers possess. Fearful that If the de
mand on the employes was made direct
from the administration offices, the
scheme would-be exposed arid the discov
er?' would cost thousands of honest votes
next Tuesday, those squeezers of the
public workmen choose a roundabout
way to accomplish their purpose. They
waited until near election. Then Herbert
Schmitz passed the word to two of â¢ his
trusty employes that they should see
every workman and ask' him to contrib
ute. These two men, whom several em
pioyes say are Joseph Melden and; Wi
lliam Dunn, approached each man ac
cording to command and explained in
an Indirect way * that it , would be better
for him to jslve up a part of last month's
wages. . Fearful of his job,"" each prom
ised to 'give . something, , : the amounts
ranging from $2 50 to $5 each/. -The under
standing ;with each ' man : was . that this
moneys would be retained by Herbert
Schmitz, when the warrants were. paid.
There promises, however, to be a quick
end put to the pretty scheme. /The Board
of Park Commissioners â¢ has-been notified
and will undoubtedly make, an Immediate
investigation.. If "the proofs can be ob
tained, there is little doubt that ',;many,'
heads will fall. The fusion managers are',
also determined to gift the matter to
the bottom! ' '. ..
Many of the employes, especially those'
\u25a0-\u25a0â¢\u25a0..
who have served the city for many, years,
are Indignant | that the assessment was
levied upon them. They ; earn a meager
wage and * they can 111 afford to pay
out money to a' grafting: administration.'
"I didn't want to .give \u25a0 anything,'/; said
a gray-bearded workman yesterday. ' "but :
, I knew that I would . have to - pay. or ,losÂ« !

Troops nt Odessa Unable to Stop' the
Slaughter.
ODESSA, Xov. 3.â After a fairly quiet
night, stooting again commenced this
morning. The Red Cross is busy attend
ing: lo the wounded.
There was a veritable reign of terror on
October :;i. After the Emperor's mani
festo granting a constitution to Russia
had been published the Jews made the
Russians' lurious with rage by making
a .prominent "display.. of red flags, tram
pling on a pprtralt of the Emperor and
tearing down the emblem of .'. the* crown.
Late In the afternoon there was fighting
in the outskirts of the town and the mas
sacre of Jovfij commenced and lasted dur
ing the nijht of November 1. All Jews
found In the streets were severely beaten
and many were killed in their shops,
which wtre ruthlessly . pillaged. In the
poorer Jewish quarter on the outskirts
of the town whole streets were. destroyed,
the soldiers apparently * looking '" on:
Crowds of workmen,. rowdies,- women and
children laden with all kinds ,of loot,
walked openly â¢through' the streets quar
reling over the spoils. Bombs were thrown
in various parts of the' town. Later.'at
night patrols o;' soldiers and Cossacks re
stored some semblance of order.
The pillaging was continued yesterday
and there was; heavy firing all over the
town. 'Nobody was safe in the streets.
People carrying^ arms who were caught
by the troops n-ere shot at sight. The
shutters of all houses were ordered closed
and people detected shooting from win
dows were promptly shot. "The soldiers
used machine guns to clear away thfc
crowd from the vicinity of the port. In
fact, there was Indiscriminate shooting
everywhere in tewn.
Firing is still ;?oing on. Trade is at a
complete standstill. Gas and water works
are working.
It is impossible to - make a correct es
timate of the number- of killed and
wounded. -â¢
Similar serious reports reach Odessa
from most of the other towns in South
ern Russia.
Bodies of police escorted by squads of
infantry are placarding the cities with ;
notices from the Mayor appealing to alii
peaceable citizens to remain Jn^oors un
less the most urgent necessity takes them
out.
The recriminations 1 , of the different fac
tions in regard to tht> responsibility for the
outbreak are bitter. Official circles blame
the Jews, but the Liberal leaders declare
the disorders were; engineered in St. Pe
tersburg. ' ' \u25a0 _
A ieading general In "an. interview to
day argued that trus disturbances were
the result of. the behavior of the Jews,
who rudely shocked Russian patriotism
j by the manner in wiich they celebrated
ion Tuesday the publication of the'impe-
I rial manifesto.
j; "They abused the.r . new-found ; free
! dom," he declared, "ty tearing down the
national flag,- hoisting revolutionary ban
ners, insulting the Ertperor and boasting
that they alone gave Russia freedom.*
f On' the other hand, -he Liberal leaders
isay that \u25a0 the simultaneous manner in

"The Jewish quarter has been given
over to plunder, rapine, and murder ever
\ since the Emperor announced the grant- j

heard. The Cossacks and dragoons Im
mediately charged , into the crowd firing
right and left and the police and others
dragged away the dead .and wounded,
numbering more than 130. into the neigh
boring court yards, ~- while the terror
stricken demonstrators fled; pursued by a
mob of ruffians, who attacked them as
they ran.
"At 7 o'clock In the evening an organ
ized attack on the Jewish quarter began
on the pretext that' during the week -a
portrait of the Emperor had been in
sulted in the " Town Hall.- . The lower
quarter of the town of Podil was sacked,

a Jewish deputation protection, the pil

Advices to the Daily Mail from St. Pe

covery of a plot to massacre. the Jews in

IN ENSEMBLE
Tuneful "Norma" found its principal
strength In ensemblelast evening at; the
Tivoli. The last act, sonorous with" lib
erally bestowed brass music, a' chorus
that sang con amoire and Signorlna-Pe
trella, Angloletti and Gravina singing
strongly, was one of' the successes of the
season. Had the whole opera gone as well
as the last scene itÂ» would have i created a
great furor. \u0084 The truth ; Is that'- the ef
fect .was badly marred by the unfortunate
forcing of "their voices by Slgnorlna Pe
trella and Signorina Grasse in the, earlier
acts. :
The third act was especially disappoint
ing when the "Hear, Me iN'orma" ; duet
became a competitive tremolo on"- the"! part
of the principals. But when Petrella sang
with -more moderation she received,: and
legitimately was entitled to, a: great deal
of praise for conscientious and tuneful

CHINA TO MAKE
DUE REPARATION
To Punish the Natives Who
Killed the Missionaries
and Provide Compensation
KEPOKT FltOM HOCKHILL
No Steps to Be Taken by the
United States in Belief
That Eiglit Will Be Done
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 3.â The Chinesa
Emperor has directed the Governor of
the province of Cantbn to punish his sub
jects who are responsible for the .mur
der of four American missionaries and a
child on" October 28 at Llenchow. , Dis
patches from Minister, Rockhill at Peking
and Consul Lay. at Canton were received
to-day ~ giving the details of the crime.
Minister Rockhill advises the department
that' the attack resulted from the refusal
of the : missionaries to, permit the firing
of cannon during a. Chinese festival.
This Government will take . no steps to
secure ,> reparation, as the Chinese Gov
ernment will d% what is -proper under
the ; circumstances.
In addition to ordering the Viceroy of
Canton to / inflict 7 exemplary punishment
upon the perpetrators and all guilty of
ficials, it is understood that compensation
is to be made and adequate protection to
be afforded, for 'all missions.
' HONGKONG, Nov. 3.â Bishop Merel of
the Catholic. church has received ; a let
ter-confirming, the news of the massacre
of the American missionaries at Llen
chow. It seems that Dr. Machle re-"
quested the removal- of a 'street theater
near by the hospital on account of the
noise. This request Incensed the Chinese,
whoVbecoming ; violent, attacked' the hos
pital. The" mob then paraded the street,
exhibting, the skeleton used in the in
struction of. the medical class and alleging
that it was an example of theforelgners"
inhumanity to the Chinese people. I
Becoming frenzied the crowd burned the
hospital,, the girls' /school and the resi
dences of the missionaries.
Dr. Machle, Mrs. Machle, their ten
year-old daughter, Mr. and; Mrs. Pearle,
Dr. Eleanor Chestnut and Miss Patterson
took refuge in a cave. The mob pursued
them and killed all except Dr. Machle
and Miss Patterson, who escaped to the
Yamen. Dr. Machle was badly wounded.
\ The American gunboat Callao and
two Chinese gunboats, with members of
the" American Board of * Missions,- are
proceeding to the scene of the mass
acre. "% :'
Advices from Canton declare that the
measures taken to suppress disturb
ances in the provinces are inadequate
and that the native officials will not
give out any information on the sub
ject. â¢
The Catholic converts have written to
Bishop Merel to petition the Viceroy of
the province for the protection of the
French mission at Lienchow.
\u25a0It is declared that the boycott head
quarters at. Canton received the first",
news of the massacre of tbe American
missionaries at Llenchow, but. the na
tive gentry assert that the boycotters
are not connected with the slaughter. !
The Chinese officials at Canton main
tain that .t hey. have no information in
regard to the massacre and at the head
quarters .of the | anti-American boycott
it \u25a0 is asserted. that the boycotters had
no connection with the killing of the^
missionaries. '.L:-L<'\';i'~.
NEW \u25a0 YORK, Nov. .3.â Tho Rev.
Arthur J. Brown, one of the secretaries
of the Presbyterian Board "fcf Foreign
Missions in this city, received a cable
gYam^ in answer to one sent' to Rev.
Henry V Noyes of Canton, China, yes
terday. Dr. Brown interprets the cable
to mean that a : religious festival of the
Chinese brought together a great crowd
of people and developed much excitement
and perhaps anti-American feeling; that
lawless characters took , advantage of
the unrest and the mob swept over the
mission premises. f v

Failure to Send Flagman
Back to Warn Approach
ing Cars Is Cause of a
Disaster in the Southland
Special Dispir.il to The CalL
: SAN LUIS OBISPO, Nov. 3.â At least
fourteen persons were injured in a col-*
llsion between two Southern Pacific trains
at Santa Margarita to-day. Of these two
women. Miss Ida Martin of Nebraska and
Miss Nellie Snyder. of St. Louis, are the
worst injured. They are in a serious con
dition. Following is a list of the other
injured travelers: ;
M. C. Glass, Mrs. Zora Glass. Mrs. W.
W. Glass of . Marysville, Mo.; Mrs. A. S.
Ackerman of Denver; Mrs. J. C Denison
of Housington, Kans.; D. C. Mattson,

Maria Martin of Ottumwa, la.; Edgar
Eagan of Clinton, la.; Roy Erham of
Housington, Kans.; E. H. Isaac of Fond
dv Lac, Wis., and Miss Catherine Crego
of Chicago.
"I'm awfully sorry to think that my
forty-two and a half years* experience on
the Southern Pacific Railroad . should be
marred by this accident. It was no fault
of my engineer, and it's all up to the
flagman of the tourist train," was all
Conductor F. H. Gould had to say after
his train dashed into tlie end car of the
tri-weekly tourists' train at Santa Mar
garita.
The special train was crowded with
hundred* of homeseekers in Southern
California, and was running ahead of the
regular train No. 22. The special stopped,
at Santa Margarita for water, but neg
lected to send a flagman to stop the ap
proaching train. As It swung around the
bend Engineer William Bigeler aid 'all in
his power to bring the train to a.stand
still, but could not do so until it had
dashed into the end car and smashed the
smoking car.
The colored porter on the special no
ticed the approacning'train. and with rare
presence of, mind threw men and women
oft* the train and saved many lives. Forr
tunately many others had alighted to
stretch their legs after a long journey,
and thus escaped injury.
News was immediately sent to San Luis
Obispo, and the 'wreck train with Dr. J. J.
Knowlton, H". M. Cox and J. S. Jackson
started to the scene of the wreck. Many
otheis went to render what assistance they
could. On arrival at Santa Margarita the
depot was found to be turned into a tem
porary, hospital. Women were lying on
cots around the platform, others were on
the benches with impromptu bandages
placed over ; their wounds.
Supervisor H. Smith and a corps of will
ing assistants did all in their power to
relieve the sufferers, and succeeded in ex
tricating many from the debris. '
All the passengers in the dining car of
the regular train suffered from the shock
and the dishes were hurled in all.direc
tions. ".

STEPS OUT
OF HIS JOB
AS DEPUTY
State Senator Markey Re
signs From the Internal
Revenue Office While Un
der Fire of Accusations
POLITICS CHANGES
THE CHAMELEON
Chief Deputy Fowler Gives
Some Explanations Con
cerning the Attitude of
One Federal Department
Political circles were agitated yesterday
by the announcement that State Senator
Frank A. Markey of the Seventeenth Dis
trict had resigned his position as a deputy
in the office cf Collector of Internal Rev
enue John C. Lynch. That Markey should
have resigned is not, in itself, so start
ling a move as to rouse political interest,
but there is a tale of politics behind the
retirement of Senator Markey.
Harking back a few weeks the politi
cians remember that Lynch's deputies
were conspicuously strong for the Ruef-
Schmttz copartnership. The very first
break which occurred in the Primary
league was led by one of Lynch's depu
ties. Peter Kelly. This same deputy,
Kelly, bolted from the League in the
Twenty-eighth Assembly District. He
ran an independent ticket for Ruef in the
Twenty-eighth. He went into the Repub
lican convention a leader of the Twenty
eighth District delegation, and took his
orders from Ruef. So much for -Deputy
Kelly.
Now ' the word is' passed along that
Kelly has had a sudden change of heart,
that he is out shouting hard, for Part
ridge.
A few days ago Senator Markey was
charged with having attempted to break
up a Partridge meeting in the Twenty
eighth District. 'His resignation, which
was withheld from the public until forced
from the internal revenue office, has add
ed significance. It has been said that
some men need not have been born with
a veil to discover the signs of the times.
Collector Lynch is out of town. In his
absence .yesterday . Chief Deputy Fowler
made the following statement:
"Senator Markey resigned because of
attacks made upon Mr. Lynch by news
papers. He did not desire to' remain in
a position which would subject - Mr.
Lynch to further attack. Markey denies
he was guilty of the charges made
against himself."
"Doesn't Markey's resignation while
under fire amount to a confession that
he did the things charged against him?"
was asked.
"Xo; it is not a confession," replied
Fowler.
"Then why did he resign at all?*'
Fowler repeated- that Markey had re
signed to protect Lynch.
Chief Deputy Fowler added in gratuit
ous explanation: ' - -
â¢"Six months ago Mr. Lynch placed the
appointing power in my hands and since
then J'have named twenty-five or thirty
deputies, regardless of their politics. I
am for Partridge and I know of no one
in thi6 office who is ' for Ruef and
Schmitz. On the contrary, we- are work
ing enthusiastically for Partridge. I
have heard Mr. Lynch request deputies
who went to him for advice to support
Partridge." - ,T^:J^.J. i.^li-\u0094
MR RELIES
ON HIS RECORD
Schmitz Points With Pride
to Conditions Existing
Under His Administration
"I am relying on my record," declared
Mayor Schmitz last night during every
speech he made. "I believe that the peo
ple of this city are convinced that I have
the best welfare of San Francisco at heart
and that they are satisfied with the pres
ent administration. The peaceful condi
tions which now exist have, been brought
about, to a great extent, by â¢my efforts.
Give me a Board of Supervisors that will
support me and I will promise the great
est administration that this .city has ever
known. I have been vilified more than
any other man who has occupied the
Mayor's chair in San Francisco or any
other city. I say that this is caused by
no enmity to me, but I am attacked be
-cause I am tfte representative of tho
plain people. I am confident of victory.
I am satisfied with the fight."
Last night was another busy time for
Mayor Schmitz and the rest of the candi
dates of the Union Labor party. . They
spoke at eight halls, each of which was
well filled. The Mayor opened St. Antho
ny's fair, spoke next at Duveneck's Hall,
Twenty-fourth" and Church streets, and
then addressed a gathering at Sixteenth
and Valencia 6treets- Eintracht Hall was
the fourth stop, Bothwell Browne Hall
was next, and Saratoga Hall, where the
Schmitz Rough Riders' Club held sway,
was the sixth point. Apollo Hall and
Stelrhke Hall finished the evening. The
candidates were received everywhere with
cnecrs. â¢
\u25a0At noon yesterday Mayor Schmitz ad
dressed the workmen at First and Bran

also spoke to a crowd gathered at the

The greatest meeting of voters^held for
many days was that of last night in the
Masonic Opera Hall, South San Fran-,
cisco, to greet John* S. Partridge, Henry
U. . Brandenstein and other speakers of
the fusion ticket, " . \
Another crowd^of voters /scarcely twen
ty blocks away, in the widespread dis
tricts of the new bay shore cut-off, was
gathered at Bay Shore Hall, and the
meetings at both places, while well at
tended by many Schmitz men, showed
that they came prepared to hear reason
able argument . and to. thlnl: for them
selves. When the working-men of San
Francisco are set to thinking in this cam
paign the work of Mr. Partridge is ac
complished and his victory assured.
During the day Mr. Partridge addressed
two great meetings at Fremont and Mis
sion â¢ streets, where he spoke to over SOO
workingmen gathered from the .shops in
the district, and the other to a* packed
house at the Builders' Association, where
he was heartily greeted, \u25a0: and where it
was announced officially from the plat
form that a canvassi of contractors and
builders showed just two Schmitz votes.

of municipal graft. Mr. Heney is a
forceful, fearless and convincing
speaker.
John S. Partridge, fusion nominee for
Mayor, will receive an ovation to-night
that will inspire . the .workers in .the
cause. of common honesty .in. municipal
affairs with still greater effort to
achieve a sweeping victory at the polls
on next Tuesday. Partridge's speeches
throughout the. exciting campaign have
enlisted the attention of thoughtful
men In all the leading cities of the
country. His position as a \u25a0 fearless,
able champion of right in tho great
conflict against corruption is well
established.^
Ever since the hour of his nomina-^
tion for Mayor of San Francisco Part-*
ridge has steadily gained in the. con
fidence and respect of the people. Men
of every calling and condition of life
are impressed with his sincerity- ana
integrity." He means what he says
when he promises to oust the grafters
from the places they now occupy in
the City Hall. . He. means what he says
when he declares? that men In the De
partment of Public Works, in the De
partment of Elections and in. the Police
and Health departments shall be made
to do their duty. No curly boss shall
rule this town when Partridge . is
Mayor..- -Â»
H. U. Brandenstein, whose gallant
canvass has challenged the respect of
the people, will, speak briefly at the
Pavilion. The prospects of Branden
stein's election to the office of District
Attorney is terrifying to the boodlers.
Brandenstein will begin the good work
of sending election stuff ers and treas
ury looters to the penitentiary on the
day that he takes charge of the Dis
trict Attorney's office.

ers from power. At every place in which
he spoke the- fusion was heartily
cheered and crowds gathered about him
to shake his hand and assure him of their
support..
The first meeting was held at Bay
Shore Hall. Joseph Heilmah was "the pre
siding officer and many of the prominent
fusion candidates '.the ' speakers. -When
the cheers . greeting Mr. Partridge died
away, he told them of the significance
of the figures of Assessor Dodge regard

Francisco ; in the ? last four years. .
If e appealed .to the men who have not
made up' their minds as to how they will
vote to consider the present disgraceful
condition 'of San Francisco In almost
'every department, and asked them to de
cide whether they would cast their votes
for him or for Abe Ruef. He closed with
a denial of any connection with the Citi
zens' Alliance, and said any man lies
who says he is under the domination of
any man or party. : ..
At the Masonic Opera Hall the greatest
interest of the grafters' ticket.
This plan of sending out for non
residents was adopted when it was'as
certained that thousands of union men
in the city fiatly refused to parade un
der the auspices of Ruef aijd P. H. Mc-
Carthy. The refusals were so \u25a0numer
ous that the managers began to fear
a fizzle, hence the. orders to bring in
outsiders.
jj Level headed supporters: of the- Union
Labor ticket are advising against the
parade. -They fear that the irresponsible
recruits will become unruly 'and deport
themselves In ti manner that will cause
a reaction in favor of the. fusion ticket.
Ruef and McCarthy, however, are bent
on having the night procession on the
eve of election and the Republicans and
Democrats surely have no objection to
the whoop up. While the Ruefters are
parading the supporters of Partridge will
be diligently at work In their" respective
precincts. â¢-.
The" fact is known that Ruef and
Schmitz are frightened." The situation is
so desperate in the administration camp
that laborers of Golden Gate Park were
held up yesterday and the day before for
campaign contributions. . ,
Never In the history of San , Francisco
has the city been so overrun with pick
pockets, bunko 'steercrs, swindlers and
sharpers, men and women who prey upon
human credulity and ignorance, as at this
time. '-
Police detectives who dare to. tell 'the
truth declare that -the city is a mecca
for that class of criminals who live by
their wits and their dexterity in theft.
Scores unon scores ,of the sure-thing
crowd have flocked here, gambling \u25a0 upon
the opportunities which will be further
uncovered to them and their nefarious
business in the event of the continuance
of the Ruef-SchmitZf â¢ combination \u25a0. in
power. â¢ - *
Many of these prowlers are- wearing
the scarlet Schmitz buttons, flaunting the
emblem openly and crying "Schmitz!
Schmitz!" up and down the \ high ways
and byways of the city. ;.
Among the resorts where men do con
gregate flashily clad men, bearing the
stamp of their occupation plainly marked
not stand for the official' bleeding, while

was swept aside like Va- straw. - "
' ; . THE TRUTH HURTS. >;'
That the truth hurts,, was .evidenced

enthusiasm was manifest. The crowd
packed the floor and filled the entrances,
whilo ; the gallery was crowded. 'An ex
ceptional array, "of speakers . -was pre
sented, who reviewed the records made
by Ruef and : Schmitz and proved the
former too competent and the latter too
incompetent to'; be Mayor of San Fran
cisco. Brandenstein also spoke.
Partridge began his speech by refer
ring 1o the false ideas about the prosper
ity of San Francisco. JVhlle saying that
the. city is prosperous he maintained that
the question was whether- It"- would not
have been much* more so under a decent
administration. He ' said that Canada
and Mexico were also prosperous and
asked if the Schmitz men could assign
the fact .that there was a so-called Labor
Union Mayor in San Francisco to the
condition of those countries.
Mr.; Partridge then told how he would
clean out the government and establish
square dealing commissions where justice
could be obtained and graft eliminated,
when the interruption occurred that pre
cipitated one of the gravest scandals of
the present administration. The statement
of Jack Manning, a park employe, is
given on the front* page of this issue.
to the initiated, and this includes the po
lice, offer to lay large wagers (in stage
money) on Schmitz/ Palpably their effort
is to set the unwary, in the belief that
the Ruef-Schmitz gang has captured the
town. - v
This is going on night after night under
the blindfolded eyes of a police depart
ment which is owned body and soul by
Ruef. Jerry. Dinan, Rqefs Chief .of Po
lice, : knows -that, the. city is deluged with
bunko men. He knows that these same
sharpers are, waiting for election . night
as anxiously as' Dlnan is himself. But
the .'police are; protecting the crooks. The
records 'tell the tale. A year- ago the
'city -.was reasonably quletr There was not
then the ante-election excitement to at
tract the criminals. The police books
show that in October. 1904, the department
"made 30SS arrests. The arrests for. last
month, were 2225â570 less than the year
before, an average of 28 a day. As Josh
Billings would comment: " 'Nuf ced."

To the Voters of, San Francisco: On next
Tuesday an opportunity, is offered you to per
form an act ' of* direct - legislation. Twenty
jpars ago 1290 leafling business men, represent
ing $200,000.0C0 '.Invested capital, petitioned the
Board of Supervisors, to- Increase the amount
of the retail liquor licence, but scant courtesy,
was shown them. ! and a deaf ear was turned
to their reascnabla 'appeal.' The new charter
providing a way in which. the people may act
where their representatives fall them. It was
determined to : renew i the ; effort. A year
ago the required number signed a petition '
i asking that an ordinance . providing a quar- ,
terly license of $125 for the retail liquor eeller .
! be submitted to the people, but the Election ;
' Commissioners refused It a place pn the ballot.
' This y*ar the petition: contained 3QQO names
more than wtre necessary and It compelled
recognition.
At last the people have thf opportunity to
express their will. The Liquor Dealers' Asso
ciation has dominated the majority of the
Board o( Supervisors and 'the political conven
tions naming them.' Can they control the vo
ters of the city? That Is the question at issue.
: The increase proposed, is not a hls?h-ltcen*Â«Â»
measure. It fixes an amount less than three
â¢ fourths of the average \u25a0 UcenÂ«e cf the fourtem
largest Eastern cities and the four larg*Â«t
coast cities. The . present license Is 23 cents
a day. .The' proposed license is 81 87. "Which
is the fair and" reasonable amount? We can
but feel ashamed when we compare our record
with>.that of other eqllghteneo communities â â¢\u25a0
one-<!lghth the- average. Hcen3e and nearly three
times the number of saloons per capita. Our
elster cities on "the coÂ«wt collect 1-15 per cent
of the cost -of 'the Police Department. We
collect" 20. pjr cent. The .license paid by gar
loon-keepers Is out of all proportion to .that
exacted of other lines of -business. Real estate
broken?, stock .broken". Insurance agents. Cus
tom-house brokers, rallroaa agencies, assayers,
bankers and warehousemen all pay more. "
Luxuries properly pay. much more than the
neccssltlen of life, and It Is just and wise to,
tax more ' heavily lines of business that are
extra hazardous to the common good. More
than half the arrest* made In San Francisco
are directly caused "-by.' the saloons, being for
drunkenness, while the - more 6erio*is crimes
traceable to or probably caused by intemper
ance are variously estimated at from 25 to 40
per cent. It Is Just that saloons should pay a
larger portion of the expense of the Police De
1 partment. .
The cnlv arsument used by those opposing
this or.ltnance Is that it will turn 2500 men ouc
of emplgyment. It is wholly Improbable that
YOUNG OFFICER

Lieutenant' Burr Is Not to
Leave on Transport Slier
man for the Philippines
Lieutenant Frank S. Burr will not sail
away with his regiment, the Fifteenth
Infantry, . which leaves .for .the Philip
pines on the transport Sherman, which
departs on next Monday. Instead he
will stay benind and face a court-mar
tial. ;?VK;
The cause of all this Is said to be the
fact that the young officer was rather
"gay" while stationed at the Presidio of
Monterey, where he got himself into all
kinds of trouble. He was very fond of
having a good tlcne, not only when
through with his duties =at the post, but
his convivialities, it is rumored, some
times even extended Into the hours when
he should- have been attending strictly to
business- ...
The* young lieutenant was up for his ex
amination for promotion to captaincy.
The board that he was. to appear before
was in session and' Burr had been sum
moned to appear j before .it. The day
arrived for his examination. The board
sat in state awaiting the coming of the
candidate. They waited in vain, however,
as Burr failed to appear.
The board adjourned . till the next day.
Again it convened, but Burr did not
.put in an appearance. The board then
disbanded "in 'great disgust and the mat
ter was handed up to the department
commander. It finally came out that the
cau3& of Burr's non-appearance before
the board was that he was "away having
a good time.".
Here if leaked out that he had. been
away a great many times "having a good
, time," but on account of his past good
record in the service his "shortcomingsi"
had been overlooked by his commanding
officer. Colonel Henry C. Ward. ' "
. However," this last breech was too
much, so before the court-martial he
must go. In the meantime his regiment
will leave without him. \ '
Burr entered the army as a private^ in
company M of the Second Nebraska In
fantry on May 12, IS9B. ', He. was appointed
a second lieutenant of the Third Infantry,
United States regulars, July "9. 1393> On
May 25, 1599, he was promoted to first

one-thfrd of th<Â» S2CO now wtatltne liquor would

temporary In a community of boundless op

in cutting ofT Â«jp*rf>ir>ud opportunities for tfeÂ»

cers of character who now feel forced to

hand, probably gain patronage, from those who
deplore tb.9 evil lnfluenca of such a combina

Thousands of children and young- men and
wemen are now belns subjected to demoralisa
tion. Are they not as deserving of sympathy
as tnÂ» few able-bodied m<tn who w111..bÂ» obliged '
to givo up a business so unprofitable that it
cannot pay $t 37 a day as its share of tha
public expense? The? probabilities arÂ« that
about 1200 retailers will not be ail* to pay thÂ»
license. Grocers can sell in quart packages,
but the screen and the bar must go, as they
ought to so. No one who wants a drink will
find givat difficulty In srettins it if 2COO places
remain from which to choose. If these pay tha
license the increased revenue will be J730.000.
which will materially reduce taxes, or enabls
the city to bmld noble buildings without bond
issues, giving lucrative employment to many
more men than will be forced out of buslnesn.
The expressed fear that prohibition will fol
low is wholly unfounded. The prohibitionist*
art: mostly in line with the saloon-keepers, la
being: resolved not to support this ordinance,
since they believe It wrong in princioU t&
license the sale of liquor.
The . statistics of arrests published 'by the
opponents of - higher license are misleading,
since there is no established uniformity of cus
tom. Arrests are often fewer In a wide-open
town than in a closely \u25a0 regulated one. since
everything else is as wide open as the saloons,
and what are considered crimes In a stralght
lace<l community in \u25a0a . wide-open city are not
considered misdemeanors worth noticing. "Why
do our opponents publish tha fact that St.
Iysuis, a city. of. 7so. COO people, with a J3CO
license, made 4042 arrests for drunkenness In
on- year, and fail to state that the arrests '
In San Francisco during the same period were
15.700?
Nothing but misplaced sympathy or criminal
apathy can prevent this act of belated justice.
It Is in no sense a. matter of politics. It la a
cuesiton of public decency in which all parties
and classes ara equally interested. - The op
portunity to enact this measure has not been
eesily achieved. If It Is not improved It will
be feu that thÂ« community doe* not deserve Â»
another chance.
It is for tie voters of San Francisco to
choose betwen self-respect and subservience.
The responsibility of thc^e who have given the
opportunity has ended.

CRACKSMEN ROB
VALLEJO SAFES
Special Dispatch to Tba CalL
VALLKJO, Nov. 3. â Safe crackers se
cured over $3<>o worth of stan:ps and
J9OO worth of diamonds as loot from
the safes in the Valle.lo postofllce at art
<?arly hour this morning. The work
was done cuietly and with dispatch,
and the police have but a slight clew
to work upon.
The bisj safe in Postmaster J. J.
Luchsintrer's office was entered by
breaking off the combination with tools
stolen from i2urns" blacksmith shop, a
block away. The burglars opened the
outer door and secured entry into the
big vault of the standard Government
safe, where stamps and registered pack
ages, which were awaiting 1 dispatch
to-day, were stored. The stumps taken
â¢were principally of the 1-cent denom
ination. None of the registered pack
ages was taken away irom the build
ing, but all were broken up. There was
up ward, of $1500 in gold in an iron box
stored in the bottom of the Â«afe. It is
presumed that the burglars did not take
this because they were frightened away
by George Roe. editor of the Times,
who dropped into the oifice to post a
letter as he was going home at
2:50 a. m.
In a smaller and private safe be
longing to Postmaster Luchsinger* was
considerable Jewelry belonging to Mrs.
Luchsinger. This safe was broken open
in the same manner and all the valuables
taken.
Entrance to the building was effected
by breaking open the back window of
the postoinoe building.. The postofllce
is located on Georgia street, in the
heart of the city, and the operators
must have been experienced crooks, for
they did their work quietly^and .left
no clew behind. Fostal Inspector Coyn
came up from San Francisco to-day to
investigate.

The Wall-Street Journal said In 1902 In -re-,

"The railroads at this moment stand in ser
ried ranks racing the law and the settlement
of the present dispute involves- a settlement
on first principles. Abuse of the railroad-In
terests on the one hand and : of the Interstate
Railroad Commission on the tther. at; this

guilty of Imprudent action . and ,the latter of

year he went to Nome as -the representa
tive of Campbell, Metson '& Campbell of
this city, and intended to return .before
the close of the season, but illness pre
vented his coming out on the'last'steam

The real objection of railroad . men to the

distrust of the -sort of men who may be ap

ment of Professor yon Neumayer, coach
erf the production of "Paola and Fran-;

the production to a date later than No

There has been a conflict between Pro

tion, and Professor yon Neumayer, dra- !
, matlc coach, over this production. Armea
' believes It ehould -be made as originally
â¢ plannedâ on November 18. Yon Neumayer
has said it would be impracticable to do
ft > that more time is needed, for rehear
sals. It has been suggested that if Yon :
Neumayer was thoroughly capable, all ,
svould be in readiness on November -iS.
V<in Neumayer has retorted in kind to
this su'gg-estion and the situation has be
come decidedly strained. To-day's meet- ;
..ing was expected to result in an under
standing that would settle the matter.
-.â¢'At the conclusion of the meeting Ppo
fossor Armes said: "Professor yon Neu
. mayor was not present, and it was
thought that it would be discourteous to
him. to discuss the date of the 'Paola

This being interpreted, was declared to
'"be nothing more than passing the re

LOGAN TRIES TO BAFFLE THE LAW
Ethel Cook Says He Gave Her Drug
and Took Potion Himself in the
Medford Jail^
OAKLAND, Nov. 3.â <3nly his ignorance
of the amount of laudanum necessary to'
cause death prevented Henry A. Logan,
the disgraced trustee of the First Free
Baptist Church of Oakland, from ending
not only his own life, but that of Ethel
Cook, the sixteen-year-old schoolgirl with
whom he eloped from this city, at the
time the pair, were arrested lntMedford,
Or. Fearing pursuit and capture after
he had cruelly deserted his wife and child
the renegade churchman made prepara
tions to end the lives of his companion
and himself, while on the way to the
city where they were apprehended, and
Immediately after his arrest he made the
attempt not only to cheat Justice by sui
cide but to take, the life of the child
whom he had enticed from her home.
The facts of Logan's unsuccessful at
tempt to end his life and that of his
companion were made- known by the lat
ter this morning in her testimony at the
preliminary examination of the accused
churchman. In response to the questions
of the Prosecuting Attorney the girl told
the following story:
, When we reached A6hland, Mr. Logan went
to a drug atore and bought a bottle of lauda
num. He did not tell me at that time what
ha intended to do, but simply put it in his
pocket. When we reached lledford we went
to a restaurant to get dinner. While we were
at the table the officer who arrested us came in,
and after looking at llr. Logan for a few
minutes came over to where we were seated
and told him. that he wai the man he, wanted,
and that he was under arrest. He told us to
finish our dinner, and that he would wait out
side.
BOTH TAKE LAUDANUM.
Nelthtr of us felt like eating very much
more after that; and after we had finished
Mr. Logan took the bottle of laudanum from
his pocket and put a teaspoonful of it into my
glass and a teaspoonful into his own. Then
he said. "We will drink this and die together."
We both drank it, and then the officer came
in and took Mr. IÂ»gan to the Jail and me to
the, hotel. That night I was very sick, and
the doctor said that if I had not taken too
much cf the laudanum I would have died.
Captain of Police Wilson, who brought
Logan back to Oakland, testified that
the bottle which had contained the laud
anum had been found in Logan's pos
session after his arrest and corroborated
the story told by the girl.
The preliminary examination of the ren
egade church trustee, who is specifically
charged with child stealing, was begun
this morning before Police Judge Sam
uels. Mrs. Mary Ross, the mother of
fethel Cook, told the story of the flight
of her daughter from her home with
Logan, with whom she had become ac
quainted while teaching a Sunday school
class at the First Free Baptist Church.
She also told of going to Medf ord , after
the pair had been arrested and bringing
her daughter back to this ctty.
Judge A. L. Frlck, who Is conducting
Lcgan's defense, did not cross-examine
the witness and asked but few questions
during her testimony, and these only on
minor points.
CIIU, AS A WITNESS.
The companion of Logan in his flight
from Oakland was the next witness called
by the prosecution and she still occupied
the witness stand when court .was ad
journed at noon. The girl testified that
she had first met Logan at the First
Baptist Church and that a few months
before the elopement he had commenced
to write letters to her, which he gave to
her in church.
She said that later, after his attention
to her had -attracted the notice of mem
bers of the church, he had ceased to give
notes to her at the church and. had hired
a private bdx at, the postofflce, for which
he had a duplicate key made, which ha
gave to her and that after that they
had addressed letters , t<?^ each other to
this box. After this she 'told the story
of her elopement with the church trustee
after he had promised to send her to
echool and then marry her and their flight
to Oregon. Then came the sensational
Btory of Logan's attempt to end his own
life and that of his companion when he
found himself in. the toils, of -the law.
The examination was continued to 10
a. m. to-morrow and the prosecution ex
pects to complete its case at that time.
HERSCHEL'MAYALL?
DEFEATS HIS WIFE
The embryonic state of the alleged
offenses of Herschel Mayall, hero of a
thousand terrible conflicts on the stages
of the Central and other playhouses,
has saved him from the necessity of
paying his wife, Lulie, who has sued
him for separate maintenance, the sum
she demands. In an > opinion handed
down yesterday by "Judge Hebbard he
holds that time alone can incubate the
offenses' charged into causes of which
a court would take consideration, so
Mrs. Mayall must wait the passing of
the months. \
In so deciding Judge Hebard sus
tains an opinion recently handed t down
by Judge' Seawell to the effect that as
the law in an action for maintenance
is governed by the same rules that pre
vail in actions for divorce Instituted on
the ground of desertion, which cannot
be maintained until one year after the
desertion actually occurs, an action for
maintenance cannot be prosecuted un
til after the lapse of the same period.
While acknowledging that this ruling
may cause great hardship to.some^mls
treated wives, the court says that as
the law now exists on the statute books
there Is no remedy.

OAKLAND, Nov. 2.â Jacob Latz, a far
mer, 65 years old, committed suicide last
night in room 13 of the Niles Hotel, in
Niles, by hanging himself. He, used a^
leather belt fastened to a clothes hook In
the wall of his room. That he was thor
oughly determined to end his life was

HORSE FELLED
BY AUTOMOBILE
BERKELEY, Nov. 3.â An automobile
driven by an unknown chauffeur collided
with a four-horse attached to a
wagon owned by the Spring Construction
Company" at Mllvia and Virginia etreets
last night and injured a valuable horse
so seriously that it was necessary to
shoot the animal. /
| The automobile was not .Injured by the
collision nor were any of the occupants
of the car. The chauffeur did not slacken
his speed after the accident, but went
swiftly on, ignoring the damage he had
done, apparently Indifferent to the entire
affair. -
James Boyce, driver of the construc
tion company's horse that was injured,
reported the matter to Manager C. L*
Creed, in Berkeley. Mr. Creed notified
Marshal Vollmer, who visited the scene
of the accident, and after examining the
injured horse directed that the animal
be shot. The horse's leg was broken in
the collision. Marshal Vollmer was in
formed by several men who were on the
scene at the time of the accident that
they recognized the automobile as. one
used by the Humboldt Lumber Company
of Oakland.
\u25a0 Manager Creed said to-day that he had
telephoned -'to- Hugh Hogan of the Hum
boldt Lumber Company regarding the
matter and that Mr. Hogan had prom
ised to investigate and if it should be
shown that his automobile or. employes
were responsible for the accident the
proper reparation would be made. The
horse killed was valued at $250 by the con
struction-company. â¢
PAUSON'S TROUBLE'
i NBAES FINALITY
The clothing establishment of Pauson
was well represented on -the divorce cal-.
lendars considered by the Superior Court
yesterday. The most important, of
course, was that involving Samuel Pau
eon, the bead of the establishment, who .is
suing his wife, Emma, for divorce on the
ground that she has ..been unfaithful,
naming the sons of several prominent
merchants as" corespondents.
When the case was called before Judge
Trout: yesterday a demurrer to the com
plaint that had been interposed on behalf
of Mrs. Pauson was overruled by consent
and she was given ten days to answer.
It is understood, however, that she will
not answer the complaint and that Pau
son will take his decree by default. The
proceedings were â¢ held before' Judge
Troutt.
Next at the bar of Judge! Graham's
court came Baptlsta Passera, who may be
termed the foot of the Pauson establish
ment, he being employed there as porter.
PasÃera was sued by wife for divorce
on the ground of cruelty. The testimony
developed that Mrs. Passera is a widwife,
enjoying a lucrative practice, and that all
of her trouble with her husband was due
to a difference of opinion as to which
should enjoy the exclusive right to handle
the. family funds.
Paesera held that as the lord and mas
ter of the household he snould be given
this privilege, while his wife held to the
contention that as she. earned the most
money she should enjoy . the pleasure of
distributing the joint account among the
tradespeople and keeping the bank ac
count in a well nourished condition^ It
did not, it seems, occur to the litigants
to reach an agreement that each should
handle the money each earned, and this
point was seized upon by Judge Graham
to effect a reconciliation, between. them.
"You have children," said Judge Gra
ham, "and they thould be your first con
sideration. It strikes me that instead of
being a cause of strife between you, the
fact that. you' both enjoy an income should
be a matter for mutual congratulation.
1 think that you had better drop -these
proceedings." ' . .
"Won't you _i try, madam?" said, Judge
Graham, addressing Mrs. Passera. r, [
1 "Yes, 1 will try,", she said,; Jier eyes on
the floor.f .. -. - â¢ â¢.<' .
"And you will be equally forgiving, '.will
you notV" said the court, , looking, severely
at Passera. Whether from [fright;; or a
true Inclination to forgive is- not known,
but Passera nodded consent. and, .with his
wife on his arm, he left the courtroom. :
"Put the case over Indefinitely,": said
Judge Graham to his clerk. , "I am â¢of
opinion that they will live happily.".,:
Decrees of divorce were grantedtyester

Her brother, J. Mahoney, said: "My
sister was a girl of remarkably good sense
and always cheerful. She had none but
girl friends, all of whom are known to the

croachment on the county road here by

visors of Santa Clara County arrived this
morning to- find gangs or workmen tear
ing up the roadbed and railroad tracks
across University avenue. No fran
chise was asked for and in consequence
the action aroused the Supervisors, j
. The business men here feared the rail
road company, once it gets the track laid
across the avenue/ will use it as a freight
yard and block the street traffic worse
than ever. -Assurances were given Jhe
Supervisors that the tracks would be re
moved Monday morning following the in
tercollegiate football game. The Super
visors will have the track removed un
less the railroad company fulfills its
promise.
... All progress in the work would have
been" stopped this . morning had not the

DONATION IS MADE
BY COM3IISSIONERS
At a meeting of the Park Commission
ers held yesterday at the Palace Hotel,
Commissioners A. B. Sp.reckels and
Reuben H. Lloyd gave notice to the board
that they would turn over $200 left to
them by the will of Mrs. Honora Sharp
to the park.
The money was left to Mr. Spreckels
and Mr. Lloyd as private Individualsâ
not as Park Commissioners. As the will
is to be contested, the two Commission
ers thought It best to make a declaration
of. their Intention and to put the money
into a trust to be used for the adorn
ment of ; the park when. obtained.
After careful consideration the, Com
missioners determined that It would be
profitable for them to use park teams to
convey refuse usedv as fertilizer and to
charge the stables a stated rate for the
removalof "the stuff. It was decided to
charge $30 a month > for the removal of
one load a day and JCO for two loads. In
this way the fertilizer will be secured and
a neat little sum will be made each
month for use in park improvements.

day by thd authorities. The students
inithe dormitory -hereafter -are to have

for which the atudenfs were striving.
The necessity of filling the place left

Mrs. Stanford came up for discussion.
Nothing definite was accomplished, the
general spirit of the body being that
the selection of a new member now
was premature.
; The question of water supply was
discussed at considerable length. It
was finally decided to allow the mat

at this meeting, but a .strong denial
was presented instead. Lathrop is now
on a vacation, his place being filled by

JUNIOR CLASS
MEETS SENIOR
Students of Stanford Uni
versity Mix inÂ» Lively
.Style After "Ping Ugly"
FIGHT ON THE CAMPUS
Headgear of Third Year
Men Eoughly Handled in
a Battle for Supremacy
Special Dispatch to TnÂ« Call. â¢
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Xov. 3.â
The "Plug Ugly," the annual event of, the
third year class at the Stanford Uni
versity, was held to-night on the football
oval by the men of 1907. The show
proved a hit In more senses than .one.
Institutions of the faculty and tha student
body and conspicuous individuals were
hit right and left- The show itself was
subjected to much mock praise from the
immense throng of seniors and sopho
mores on the bleachers. The cast wa3
extremely clever.
The juniors who did not take part In
the actual production stood guard at .the
gate and In the neighborhood of the rough
platform which did duty as a stage. All
the third-year students were easily dis
tinguished by their gTotesquely painted
â¢â¢lids." .<:.. '\u25a0Â£, ::-
After the performance the Juniors
formed a compact mass and started oit
the march for the "quad," which 13 the
goal of the evening. If the juniors can
encircle the buildings despite the attacks
from the seniors and safely reach the
steps of the campus postofflce they are*
accredited with a victory. If. however,
they are delayed for any length of time
on the march by the upper class men or
are obliged to go around the obstacles
presented they are generally considesed
disgraced. The tussle began as soon as
the men of both upper classes started fcr
the quad. The seniors attempted to
smash the "plugs." and from the ap
pearance of the hats after the fray they,
were generally successful. At the steps
leading up to the Arcade the determined
stand of the seniors stopped the Juniors
for only a few moments and then the
crowd surged on. This performance was
repeated at each stop. When the post
office steps had been reached the seniors
summoned all their forces, but were un
able to gain the upper hand. At thin
point a fierce rush broke out among the
freshmen and sophomores. In this case
also the odd numbered class proved the
best organized.

feet, abutting into Tupper S. Malone's
drug store, and used for the last efeven
years as a dining room closet by J. C.
Hoover, proprietor of a candy factory and

two parties, and _the row promises to
reach the highest tribunals in . the land
before it is settled. c*-j '" '
when Mrs. Hoover returned
from San Francisco and went to the
closet to get some china out for the even-
Ing meal she found the door securely
fastened and "./as obliged to get a car

started with the progressive druggist,
who. however, would not Dudge from his
position, and told Mrs. Hoover that her
goods had been removed from his closet
and were now in the yard.
Mrs. Hoover consulted several attor
neys, -who advised her that she was en
titled to the use of the closet and that*
ilalor.e had no claim on It.

CRUISE BRINGS
GOLDEN RESULTS
Steam Whaler William Bay
lies Arrives With a For
tune in Bone in Her Hold
WORTH OVER ;\u25a0 ,' $100,000
Captain's Share Is $16,000,
Mate's $8000 and Men's
Down in Small Figures
The steam whaler William Baylies, with
a fortune in whalebone stowed away in
her hold/ arrived yesterday from the Arc
tic.*? The Baylies and the Monterey, which
arrived Wednesday, were the only vessels
of the -Arctic fieerto escape from the ice.
The Monterey was ~- in company with the
Baylies until the ice assumed a threaten
ing aspect. On account of her diminutive
size the Monterey started for home. After
she left the Baylies began to catch whales
and had no more trouble with the ice.
To the harpoons of the William Baylies
there fell sixteen bowhead whales, which
yielded 16,000 pounds of bone. This bone,
under ordinary circumstances, would be
worth from $5 to $6 a pound. J.he impris
onment in the ice of the remainder of the
fleet, however, will have the effect of in
creasing the worth of the Baylies* catch
to $7 or $8 a pound.- From captain to
green hands all are paid for the voyage a
certain proportion or lay of the value of
the catch. This proportion varies accord
ing to the man's rating. The green hands,
whose interest is something a little more
than two-hundred ths,. are. paid on a basis
of .$1 50 a pound. \ .
: FORTUNE FOR CAPTAIN. â¢',
Captain Bodflsh, master of the William
Baylies, will receive more than $16,000 for
his eight, months' work. His mate will
gel about $8000. second mate $5000, -and so
on down the line. The green hands will
receive about $200 each, less the amount
charged against them in, the slop chest
account.) In the latter case the process
used in fixing the , value of ' the bone is
reversed. For bone worth $8 -the green
hand Is paid $1 DO a pound, and for shirts
worth 50 cents he is charged $5. When
the green hands of the William Baylies
receive what: is left of that $200 they may
realize something of the true meaning of
frenzied finance. But some of them will
go whaling next year. â¢
The biggest whale caught by the Wil
liam Baylies yielded 2900 pounds of bone.
Apart from its financial success the cruise
was uneventful, and the William Baylies
brought back all her boats intact. | She
did not even shiver her timbers. Captain
Bodflsh; who was elated at his own good
luck, declined to furnish any information
about the imprisoned whalers. He want
ed to get ashore and take a ride In a car
riage, he said.
CALIFORNIA OUT OF LUCK".
Three men ran away from the whaler
at Cape Lisbon. .They were sent . ashore
for \u25a0 fresh .water and never came back. ,_
Close behind -the William Baylies- me.
sperm whaling bark California sailed in
through the Golden Gate.
The William , Baylies had got sixteen
whales in eighteen months. The Califor
nia, returning from a two years' cruise,
brought back the yield of but one ..whale.
Three hundred and. twenty barrels of
whale, oil and 2000 pounds, of bone was all
the harvest she had reaped, and Captain
Joseph's face was long as the hair on the
heads of the crew.. Charles Weir, black
smith, died May 2,' a victim of stomach

WATER IN MILK
City Chemist Makes Belated
Discovery That Practice
Is Extensively Carried On
ASKS FOR APPARATUS
States Ordinance Requiring
Twelve Per Cent Solids in
Fluid Cannot Be Enforced
\u25a0j'pln" his monthly report for October
relative to the chemical analysis of
milk, filed with the Health Board yes
terday. City; Chemist Gibbs directs par
ticular attention to the fact that the
milk supplied ' to consumers In this
city is being extensively watered. The
discovery -made by. Gibbs is rather be
lated, since the average householder
has -for some time past been suspi
cious of the fact that his milk was
not what it seemed to be. Gibbs has
evidently been moved by stress of the
public agitation against impure milk
to sit up and take notice.
Gibbs further calls attention to an
ordinance requiring 12 per cent of sol
ids in milk, which, he says cannot be
enforced because his laboratory is not
properly equipped for the purpose. The
report says in part;
The practice of watering milk is extensively
carried on by dealers In this city. The addl
torn jof water to milk cannot with certainty
be detected in many cases with the apparatus
at hand. When . the laboratory facilities axe
enlarged and some much -needed apparatus is
provided for the analytical 'work the neces
sary evidence to secure convictions for this
fraud can be obtained.
We disclaim all knowledge of -and responsi
bility for the Integrity of samples submitted
by. persons outside 'of the department, and we
cannot be held responsible for their state
ments as to the source of the milk.
There is a city ordinance fixing the minimum
for total solids at 12 per cent. This Is a wise
provision and should be enforced, but It cannot
be done until the determinations of total solids
are made by direct weighing. . This method
requires a large number of ' platinum dlÂ«hÂ«s,
and until these are provided It Is useless to
attempt -to enforce the ordinance.
g The number of samples analysed In October
was 429.
Hydrogen peroxide found, 1 sample; boron
compounds, 3 samples;, coal-tar dyes, 3 sam
ples; fats below \u25a0 the standard. of 3.4 pÂ«r cent
and above 2.9 per cent. 38 samples; fata be
low '3 per cent, 14 samples; total number of
samples found adulterated, 65. - -
While these results show, the milk supply to
be '\u25a0 by no means ideal, .it is evident that the
use of hydrogen peroxide. . formaldehyde, borax
and coal-tar dye Is not generally practiced by
the milk dealers of the city.

.THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
JOHN* D. SPRECKEL.S Proprietor
ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHN McXACGHT â¢' ' -JL ' M^lL a ?. er
' PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
SATURDAY NOVEMBER 4. 1905
THE MAYOR AND PROSPERITY.
Ml AYOR SCHMITZ has been going up and down telling the
people how prosperous San Francisco has been for four
years under the rule of Mr. Ruef. The Mayor has claimed
it all as the fruit of his administration. He has represented himself
as Jonah and the city as his gourd, growing like a miracle. This
chas been immensely pleasing to his supporters and has not been
unattractive to others who have hot taken pains to .inform-them
selves of the facts.
The Call has said repeatedly that, instead of growing as it
ought, San Francisco has been falling behind its rivals on this
"coast and that, instead of promoting its progress, the grafting ad
ministration of the Mayor has held it back. , This is because the
lawful rights of enterprise are held by the administration as privi
leges, for which tribute must be paid to some grafter. That our
"contention was true is now proved, and put in cold figures by Dr.
Washington Dodge, the exceedingly able and upright Assessor of
this city, to whom our people owe a great debt for. the faithful and
Jionest administration of his office.
He" has saved us time and again from the raids made upon our
â¢ e assessment for the purpose of putting upon San F"rancisco an undue
share of State taxation, and in every way has been a watchful and
ty>eful officer. In his speech on Thursday night Dr. Dodge frosted
.the Mayor's Jonah's gourd and shows that, instead of being Jonah
promoting the growth of his gourd vine, the Mayor has been Jonah
ship, impeding the voyage and endangering the sailors and
* the .cargo. When he is past overboard the weather will improve and
the ship will sail prosperousl}' to port.
. Dr. Dodge shows by official figures that since 1901, when
Jonah Schmitz got on board, the property values of San Francisco
have increased 30 per cent, in Los Angeles 137 per cent, in Seattle
66 per cent. In new buildings San Francisco gained 166 per cent,
Los Angeles 550 per cent, Seattle 250 per cent. In population San
Francisco gained 31 per cent, Los Angeles 100 per cent, Seattle
o 100 per cent. Neither Los Angeles nor Seattle has had during that
tune a Labor Union party nor a Labor Union Mayor. There has^
been no class government in either city, no appeals to class preju
dice on hatred or interest. Here it is notorious that tlie Mayor's
political supporters published broadcast through the East an appeal
.to "people not to come to San Francisco. Result, only 7 per
cent gain per year in population during his administration, against
25 per cent per year for our rival cities.
â¢The improvement of real estate, which add^ to its value and
la its assessment, has been held in the grip of the grafter. Every
"brick aiid board, stone and hod of mortar has been under tribute
tg t the grafter. Result, a gain of only 42 per cent per annum in
bftildings under Mayor Schmitz, against 137 per cent in Los An
c*Â£eles.and 62 per cent in Seattle. The grafting burden upon building
has left real estate unimproved and unadvanced in value as it should
be, 'either by actual improvement or community incremeiic. Result,
2t gam in property values in San Francisco of only 7 per cent per
annum under Mayor Schmitz, against a gain in Los Angeles of 34
per cent and in Seattle of 14 per cent.
I These are the effects upon the progress of the city of grafting
d class government. If the people like that kind of thing, it is
; kind of thing they like. If they vote to renew it for another
o years, the slow movement of San Francisco and the rapid
3gress of her two great rivals on the, coast will be more ap
reiit. Los Angeles is apt to pass us next year in the value of
vv buildings, and she has no labor Mayor and no labor party.
The Mayor may hoarsen his throat denouncing his opponents
d Mr. Ruef may chatter like a monkey disturbed in his occupa
n of hogging all the cocoanuts, but they cannot change the
ures which prove that their partnership has been a worse handi
5 to San Francisco than war, pestilence or famine.
An organ of the Mayor defends this partnership openly by de
ring that an intermediary is necessary between the Mayor and
>se who seek appointments or ask for their rights under the law
d charter. So it is admitted by the. organ that Mr. Ruef is the
Ivor's "intermediary." What need has an honest and fit Mayor
â¢an intermediary? He evidently feels the need, for he is begging
...i people to re-elect intermediary Ruef, and intermediary Ruef is
0 begging them to re-elect the Mayor, who needs an intermediary.
TURBULENT RUSSIA.
THE world is saddened by the excesses that are going on in
Russia. There are fears that such a reception of their new
freedom bodes ill to that people and that, after all, the ukase of
â¢Jfberty may be recalled and the army be used to' whip and shoot
ih'e people into resubmission to the autocracy. With this in view
â¢ "Â°as c a possibility the people are playing into"" the, hands of their
0 enemies.
0 The Russian church, which is the worst hurt by the reforms
that De Witte has forced, welcomes the excesses as the probable
cause of a reaction that will renew' its power. But after all, should
there be anything unexpected in the reckless conduct of the Russian
people ? They are simply living up to a law of human nature. For
liges.'they have been under artificial restraint and have not learned
The autocracy which imposed artificial restraint is
to blame, for all that is happening. It is only a repetition 0$ what
â¢ occurred in the French revolution. Church and^state in France had
â¢ artificially restrained the people until they were strangers to self- i
control. The artificial restraint was destroyed by brute force and
The Terror followed.
If the ferment and riot in Russia can be permitted to exhaust
themsejves without provoking a reaction order will come and the
new institutions of liberty will take form and the people will learn
self-control and begin building up their fortunes as freemen.
The dreamers who demand a republic are playing into the hand
eof the enemies of the people. Russia is not ready for republican
institutions as we have them here. Education and enlightenment,
the spirit of self-control and peace and order must precede complete
self-government. The socialist declaimers who' are using their new
free speech to mislead the enthusiasm of the people are doing harm.
Unfortunately, there seems to be no great voice in Russia that can
rise above the roar of the mob and be heard and heeded in giving
wise counsel in this critical time.
We can understand the elimination of William Cullen Bryant and others
of like mold from our Hall of Fame, but who. is responsible for the
absence of McGraw, of the Giants, from a niche in the temple?â New York"

HEINOUS CONDUCT!
From patrons of the St. Nicholas dining
room it leaks out that George Bradley
is about the meanest man in Oregon. As
the story goes, a lady residing in the
coutry left some fine specimens of rasp'
berries with "Brad" with the understand
ing that the fruit was to be sent to the
Umatilla County booth at the Lewis and
Clark Exposition. The Jj accusation is
made that Bradley took the berries to his
boarding place, and, with a few selected
friends, ate up the whole' crate.â Athena

At the outbreak of the Boxor troubles
in China Dronberger was aboard the
United States steamship Concord. He
was stricken with fever and was' re
moved to a. hospital near Shanghai.
Miss Swanstrom was assigned to nurse
him. He speedily recovered. His clever
nurse took such an interest in the sea
man that she asked him to recuperate
at her home. Mr. Swanstrom, her step
father, gave him the best of medical at
tention and within a few months Dron
berger was able to return to his post
of duty. ' . ,
But Dronberger insisted that Miss
Swanstrom return. with him to America
to be his wife. Dronberger went to his
home in Ohio to secure parental bless
ings.
Then Dronberger. brought his prom
ised bride to this city and had her edu
cated in a private school.

SERMONS AND SLEEP.
Professor Haughton ; of Trinity Col
lege, Dublin, was fond of indulging in
quiet humor at 'the expense of some
of his colleagues, says the writer of
"Some College Recollections."
On one occasion he was asked by Dr.
Stubbs, a senior fellow of his college,
what he thought of the sermon
preached that morning by the Bishop
of Meath (Dr. Reichel).
"Well, Stubbs." replied the professor,
"It was admirable, but not comparable
with your own of last Sunday."
"How so?" said Stubbs, highly grati
fied. \
"Because," said the professor, "the
Bishop took forty minutes to put me to
sleep, whereas you accomplished the
same result In ten." , / ,

WHY SHE L^k JOHX.
"Have you thought well?" said the fond
mother, "of what you are contemplating
doing?"
An almost hysterical burst of sobs was
the only answer she received from the
young wife.
"John has been a good husband to you,
has he not?" was the next anxious in
quiry.
"Ye-ye-es," was the broken response,
"in most re-respects he ha-ha-has?"
"Then surely you can forgive any wrong
that he now may have committed, can
you not?"
"N-n-no. I wish I cou-could, but I
ca-ca-can't."
"What is it, my daughter? Is it as bad
as that? Tell your own mother."
\"Heâ he â he â "
"Speak right out. Surely you are not
afraid of your mother."
."He in-insists that I must let him. ha
ha-have a whole bu-bureau drawer for his
ow-ow-own."
And the mother, being a woman, her
self, could say-Bothing, much as she re
gretted the separation that seemed in
evitable.
EVERYTHING RISES.
When I am on the deep' blue sea
I see the moon rise frequently;
Betimes the bright sun rises, too,
Or wee stars rise to fleck the blue;
The great waves rise in sullen wrath.
And strange fish rise along our path â
Upon the sea, so I surmise,
There is not much that does not rise.

BEING A GOOD FELLOW
WALLACE RICE.
THE greater includes the less, and
the art of being a good fellow
when with others is swallowed up
in, first of all, being a fellow to
human kind.
The word "fellow" is a curious one,
and smacks more than most of civiliza
tion, for its origin is in the two words
"fee" and "law," signifying a partner
ship or association in some undertak
ing â originally in. holding the title to
land. The word is 'quite* old and exists
in ancient Icelandic
It is in this sense tha?one reads of
a board of fellows, the fellows of .a
college, and so on. But the word
"felly" or "felloe," part of the rim of
a wheel, comes from an older word, sig^
nifying to bind together, and the sense
may be said to hold in the more gen
eral acceptation of the term.
The Bible constantly makes use ' of
"fellow" to mean some one to whom a
duty Is owed, and a "fellow feeling,"
"one's fellow man," and a host of other
uses go to show that qne of the funda
mental notions underlying the word is
that of a common humanity.
A "good fellow," then, is one to whom
the feeling of a humanity held In com
mon with the rest of the world makes
more than ordinary appeal.
It would be useless to deny that the
phrase, as popularly applied, denotes a

clas of men upon which the unco gruid
and the exceedingly respectable have a.
tendency, to frown. In politics it has
too often been applied to those who
were willing to slight public Interests
for the sake of doing a favor to a
friend.
It is held as a title of honor by the
sporting classes generally, and a final
appeal is made in matters of persuasion
by the plea, "Oh, be a good fellow t" "
One thinks of men free .with their
money, kind to their employes, tager to
oblige their, friends, quick to do a ser
vice -implying personal effort on their
part, all as "good fellows." It is one
sign of a man of the world â a phrase of
much wider scope.
'One the other hand there is always a
large .class to which the term does not
apply. One does not think of lawyers
and constables as good fellows. The
miser or man close with hia money has
no right to the title. No man who puts
a sense of duty first and a feeling of
sympathy, for mankind next gains the
honor implied in the words.
It is, perhaps, especially significant in
this light that few clergymen are ever
so characterized.
Napoleon was never a good fellow.
Washington could be when ha chose,
which was seldom. Abraham Lincoln
always was. Julius Caesar, greatest of
men, was a better fellow with common
men than with his equals.
A MODISH BOLEROATTORNEY H. A. KROUSE
PUNISHED BY GRAHAM
Attorney H. A. Krouse, the
alleged counsel for Mrs. Char
lotta Newman Collins, was yes
terday found guilty of contempt
of court by Judge Graham after
a stormy session on the main
tenance suit A writ of prohi
bition restraining Judge Graham
from proceeding in the case
was denied by the Supreme
Court The perjury charge
against George D. Collins, be
fore Judge Thomas J. Lennon,
is moving slowly, as Collins is
grasping at every technicality
that will give him even a mo
mentary delay.

Case.

Taken Up by Re
turned Refugee.
' H..A. Krouse. the self-constituted
attorney of Mrs. Charlotte Newman
Collins, and accused agenp of George
D. .-â¢Collins, was found guilty of con
tempt *of court by Judge Graham yes
terday.
He was fined 5100 with the alternative
of five days' imprisonment. Krouae chose
thÂ«-la.tter and epent the night in the
; County Jail.
Collins waded further into a maze
of technicalities before Judge Lennon
In his attempt to have the indictment
against him set aside or quashed. A
writ of prohibition to restrain Judge
Graham from further action in Mrs.
Xewman Collins' euit for maintenance
â¢was d,enied by the Supreme Court. It
seemed that *..Â«? accused bigamist was
monopolizing the entire judicial sys
tem yesteraay.
The session in Judge Graham's
cotirt was a stormy one. Mrs. Collins
denied that Krouse was her attorney
ar.ji declared that if she signed a sub
stitution making him such she was de
ceived. It was in his desperate en
deavor to prevent these facts 'being
brought out that Krouse committed
the oftense of contempt of court.
Judge Graham warned Krouse. but
the man who "butted into" the case
was smarting under some stinging
thrusts from Attorney Hiram Johnson.
Moreover. Krouse was evidently des
* perate lest his dealings with Mrs.
Collins should be brought out. When the
court insisted upon the whole truth
Kruuse characterized the action as being
arbitrary. Judge Graham acted quickly,
finding -him guilty and imposing a fine of
5100 or five days In the County Jail.
A mysterious phase of the case is
-lhe disappearance of an affidavit and
the order of substitution. They were
last "in the possession of the clerk of
'Judge Graham's court, W. E. Price. He
left them on his desk last Tuesday
afternoon. -When he returned they
were gone.
"KrouVe had a bad day all around.
He 'was not in the least moved by the
scoring and rebuffs he received. He
â¢ remarked with a grin that he would
ga'to jail, as it was cheaper than pay
, ins the line. :.*\u25a0'\u25a0'

When he entered the court he
walked up to Mrs. Newman Collins,
who was sitting in the rear with her
J brother. \V- H. Newman. He attempted
to 'speak to her, but she turned aside.
"Tltfs Is my brother." she said, in
jdil;ating: Newman. Krouse extended
bU hand.
Newman stuck hie hand behind his
hark -and stepped aside. Krouse ex
tended him a card, saying, am your
Bister's attorney."
'â¢I <Jo not care to talk to you.' I do
not. want to know you," retorted Naw

The* benefits of the good, red blood

in a letter from Chicago:
"I 'was for years. sadly afflicted with

needs of the body under certain" condl-^
tions. My trouble extended to rectal

resents the other. I charge that this
man is guilty of tactics that no prac
titioner should employ."
"Those are not the facts," retorted
Krouse.
"From sour own mouth," retorted
Johnson, "comes the assertion that you
are acting not for Charlotte Newman
Collins, but for George D. Collins. It
is immaterial to me whether or not I
appear in this case. But I do not pro
pose that any fraud shall be perpe- I
trated on this unfortunate woman by
George D. Collins. I bring it to your
Honor because it concerns you more
than any one else. Collins shall not
select attorneys for himself and Char
lotte Newman."
SIR, BOARDMAN BUTTS \S.
"That refers to a field where I am
concerned," cried Attorney Boardman,
and all three sides began talking at
once. Judge Graham sternly silenced
them.
"I accuse Mr. Johnson of deliberately
betraying his client and selling out,"
said Krouse. This damaging accu
sation caused some tittering. Attorney
Johnson brushed aside the statement.
In eplte of a host of objections inter
posed by Krouse, Mrs. Collins was or
dered to take the stand. The unfor
tunate woman wore the look of a
frightened animal and in her bewilder
ment could scarcely speak above a
whisper.
"Has George A>. Collins ever con
tributed anything to your support since
June?" inquired Judge Graham.
"No, sir;" replied Mrs. Collins.
\u2666'Did you ever employ Mr. Krouse as
"Who is your attorney?"
"Mr. Johnson."
"What was said to you by Mr.
Krouse when he approached you, about
the case?"
"He told me that he would get me
some money."
"How about that remark concerning
honest men?" interposed Attorney
Johnson.
"Never mind about honest men," said
Krouse. -*"
Â«I jaw you talking earnestly with
Collins in Department 11," retorted
Johnson. "I suggest that another name
be added to the list of Collins* attor
neys â the name of Krouse."
"What else did Mr. Krouse Bay?"
asked Judge Graham.
"Her counsel advises her not to an
swer that question," Interposed Krouse.
"What counsel?" asked Johnson.
"I," replied Krouse.
"Ah!" smiled. Johnson^
"Tell me all that Mr. Krouse said," \
insisted the court.
"He told me" that he would get . me
some 'money if I would substitute an
other attorney," said Mrs. Collins. "He |
' gave me an affidavit and said that If I
1 would sign It he would go to Judge
Graham's court and get the money.
TELLS OF PROMISE MADE.
"He eaid that he knew where he
could get it. 'I asked him why Mr.
Johnson could not get it. He said- that
Mr. Johnson was an enemy of Mr. Col
lins. Mr. Krouse said that if I would
I sign the affidavit he would get the
money for me."
"Did he say anything about substitut
ing himself as your, attorney?" asked
j the court.
U "No, sir; he didn't tell me anything
\u25a0 about changing attorneys." ,' ;
At this point Krouse became noisy
'and Judge Graham warned him that hÂ«
.was bordering closely on contempt.
Krouse made the offensive remark that
the court was acting arbitrarily., -
I "You did not know what you were j
' signing when you^ signed an order of
substitution?", resumed the court.
"No, sir.- Mr. Krouse said that he could
get me some money and I needed it badly.
I told him that I thought hÂ» was play
lngr a trick.'.'
At this Juncture r Attorney Johnson at
tempted to â¢ ask the witness Â« a ques tiqn.
Krouse Interf erred.
"Oh shut "up!" said Johnson Impatient
ly. "Don't! talk- to me that way."
"Did Mr. Krouse get -you; to sign any
paper besides the affidavit?" continued
Judge Graham.
"Yes, but â¢Â« he did not : tell me what it
was. ' -When I asked htm ho said, .'Why
do you askr I told him that Mr. John-
THE , SAN- FRANCISCO GALL, SATURDAY; .NOVEMBER 4,%,1905.
son always told me what -he .wanted me
to sign."
"If that man will get her that money
he promised," interrupted Attorney John
son, "I yill sign that order of substitu
tion without further objection. Let him
say that he will get the money or have
him dealt with summarily." <
When Mrs. Collins was through and the
wrangling subsided Krouse;: took the
stand and testified as to the contents of
the missing affidavit and order of sub
stitution.
All through the session Johnson kept up
a rapid fire of thrusts into Krouse' s weak
spots.
"The case will be continued until 2
o'clock," said Judge Graham. "Mean
while the court finds Mr. Krouse guilty
of Insolent and contemptuous conduct."
DKCLEVES TO APOLOGIZE.
Krouse foolishly refused to take the
opportunity to apologize. He said:
"I shall at this time state that if the
finding of the court was based upon
manner or tone, or anything of that char
acter and not as to the statements them
selves, that then I am ready to apologize
for the manner and tone, for I have en
dÂ» avored to use a manner and tone which
would be courteous and respectful and
accord the court the respect which It is
entitled to, but if the court refers to
the language and the statements and the
wcrds, then I stand on what I have
done."
Krouse wa3 fined SlOO. with the altern
ative of five days in Jail. He declared
that he would take the latter. . â¢
perjury case was taken up by' Judge
Thomas J. Lennon on Collins' motion to
Quash or set aside the Indictment. The
three grand jurors who were unable to
appear Thursday were questioned. â¢ : .- \u25a0
Juror J. T. Sullivan was closely ques
tioned by Collins regarding the manner
in which he became one of the body.
PulUyan declared that when the jury was
being impaneled in Judge \u25a0'-\u25a0 Kerrifiran's
court he left, thinking that he had been
excused. He, was called back and after
ward consented to serve.
County Clerk John J. Greif was on the
stand nearly all afternoon with the rec
ords of the impaneling of the Andrews
Grand Jury and the one. before It.
The County Clerk will be called again
when tho case is resumed : at 10 o'clock
to-day. The maintenance suit against
Collins has been put over to Wednesday
at 10 o'clock. By that time H. A. Krouse
will have done his little turn In the
County Jail If he etlll refuses to pay
the fine. Then, so Krouse declares, ho
will ask that a, bench warrant be Issued
;.'or thf arrest of Collins for contempt ; of
court.
Collins does not betray the least sign
of worry. He Is deep in his game of legal [
chess and Is apparently enjoying ,the

Officer in Charge of War

A wireless message was received by
the United States Lighthouse Board in
this city on Thursday from the .cruiser
Chicago, off Pont Reyes, saying that
what looked like signals of distress had
been seen in the vicinity of that headland
on Wednesday night. \u0084-Rear^A dmiral

Captain Dan James, bound south from
Eureka, on the tug Defiance, passed the
Chicago off Point Reyes and when he
arrived here reported that the flagship
was sending up rockets. He ran in close
to the war vessel, and somebody . on the
bridge hailed * him and inquired: "Is that
Point Arena light?"
It was somewhat thick at the time and
Captain James, was under the impression
that the Chicago had lost her bearings
and was shooting rockets for the purpose
of attracting the attention of somebody
who could tell her where she was.
Captain C. J. Badger, who recently suc
ceeded Captain Moore as commander of
the Chicago, said yesterday:
"I was on the bridge" and over toward
the shore I saw what I took to be the
flare of a rocket. It might have been
that the fog, which was rather thick,
had distorted the glare of a" fire on the
foothills. When one of jmy officers re
ported that he thought he also had seen
something that looked like a fire or .a
rocket I reported the matter to -Admiral
Goodrich. The admiral decided that it
would not be advisable to take a large
vessel like the Chicago further inshore
in such thick weather and gave orders
for the sending of the message, which
I see was safely received." .
Captain Badger says further that the
rockets Captain James "saw fired from
the Chicago were touched off in response
to what were believed to be signals of
distress. He denies that the Chicago was
lost. v
"I did hail Captain James and Informed
him that the light on shore was at Point
Arena. I might have been a little am
biguous and it is possible that I conveyed
the information in the form of a ques
tion. But the hailing was for hjs benefit,
not ours. We knew where we were/ all
the time.''
Captain Moore, : who formerly com
manded the Chicago, has gone to Wash
ington for duty on the examining board.
Captain Badger's last command was the
cruiser, Newark and later he was com
mandant of cadets at Annapolis.* The

Tennis Experts Invited to
Compete for Trophies on
Claremont dub Courts*
/ANES SHIES AT MATCH
Unwilling to Play in Round
Rabin With Foley, Gardner
and Adams at the Park
. There will ba tournament matches
on both sides of the bar to-day and to
morrow. Tne principal event la tha first
\u25a0 tournament given by the Claremont
Country dub. It is to be an invitation
_ t scratch doubles tournament for the
\u25a0' Clareraont Country Club challenge
'cups.. These handsome trophies are
similar to the State and San Francisco
t chaxnplonsMp cups, and, like the lat-
I *er, are three-time clialienge trophies.
These tournaments will be held once
s a- year, but hereafter will probably be
\u25a0played in the spring. Ten teams have
.accepted the invitation of the club and
will meet In the competition. In the
"â¢.upper half are such teams as C. Wagner
' ; Â«ind R. H. Varlel. Fred Adams and
- Oeorgo Janes, respectively State and
,j \u25a0 coast champion, and the Baker brothers.
M.- Long will probably have Clarence
', Griffin for a partner and they will com
prise one of the stron^st teams in the
' upper half.
In the lower half are H. Schmidt and
.â¢\u25a0iL' Rolfe, Percy Murdock and R. T.
Crawford and Frank Mitchell and Grant
â¢Smith. It is doubtful If the last named
team will compete. The best teams qre
'scattered throughout the quarters and
the concluding rounds should be pro
ductive of some close and interesting
matches.
The first matches will be called to
.< Jay at 2 o'clock. The four teams drawn
in the preliminary round will meet this
afternoon. The club has only one bitu
men court, which the members declare
to be the equal of any in the country.
Play will be resumed each Saturday
afternoon and Sunday. The Unal match
is set for Thanksgiving day.
Besides the challenge cups there will
J -be suitable prizes for the runner-up
'team. All matches except the finals
?Â«ill consist of two Bets out of three;
finals, three out of five. The commit
5 tee in charge consists of H. H. Haight,
â¢' E. M. Walsh and R. T. Crawford.
The California Club will finish its
handicap singles tournament to-mor
,;row. As a result of last Sunday's play
six contestants remain in the compe
. tition. In the third round Harold Ga
â¢ briel (owe 30) vs. Herbert Long (owe
?0 3-6> and William Murphy (15 3-6) vs.
Albert Ken yon (owe 15) will be the
: matches. Melville Long (owe ?.0) will
meet the -winner of the Gabriel-Long
â¢â¢ match and Moulton Warner (scratch)
vrill be pitted against either Murphy of
Ken yon.
â¢â¢ .M. Long is playing a strong game at
â¢present and looks to have the best
.chance for the final place in the upper
half. Gabriel also played a clever game
last Sunday and with the odds allowed
< him .he should dispose of H. Long.
% , In the lower half Kenyon looks to be
tip against a hard proposition. Murphy
had' Jots of speed last Sunday and has
<Â£n excellent chance with the generous
odds allowed him. Many of the club
members figure Warner a sure winner.
'On the scratch mark he certainly looks
dangerous and cannot be denied a
â¢ splendid chance to carry off the honors.
' The tournament will be concluded to
'c morrow.
The finals of the bay counties cham
pionship doubles tournament will not
be played to-morow. Gardner is around
on crutches and will probably not be
c able to play for several Sundays. -
! The chances of bringing the four
champions tojrether In a round robin to
determine which is the best player are
c rem<Vte. Jane's, the coast champion, i 3
'unwilling to play, as he claims he is
"entitled to first place among the racket
| wlelders. If he participated in an event
of the kind suggested and lost he would
.still be coast champion and still rank
"?Co. 1. Janes has been beaten twice
â¢BinCe he won his title and many figure
; ie is not the best player on the coast.
" Fjoley, Gardner and Adams are all anx
ious to meet In a round robin, but un
less the coast champion can be made
Â«\u25a0 to see he has much to gain and little
.to lose by participating the tennis en-
Ihuslasts will miss seeing one of the
moat Interesting events ever held in
.* this, city.

MYSTERY VEILS THE FOOTBALL MEN
ELEVENS PRACTICE BEHIND CLOSED GATES
BEAR STORIES
FROM STANFORD
Usual Reports Are Preva
lent as to a Slump in the
Condition of the Cardinal
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 3.â
The football fans of the cardinal are
up in the air. . The varsity men are
practicing behind closed gates and
have been doing so since their return
from Los Angeles. How the team is
rounding into form is a matter of con
jecture. It is safe to say that if the
cardinal should be defeated by the
blue and gold contingent It will not be
for want of work on the part of the
Stanford men and the coaches. ' So
hard has been the strimmage work of
late that many of .the players have
been seen about the "quad" nursing
wrenched shoulders and bruised noses.
Bull Chalmers in partioular is suffering
with a badly fractured nose. Hook,- the
promising substitute for the stalwart
captain at right half, has received a
hard jolt on the shoulder and it is
doubtful whether he will be able to
mix up any more this season or not.
The best news to the Stanford com
munity is that Jim Crow is not so
badly injured as was reported at the
time of the hasty examination. It was
feared that the bulwark of strength both
on offensive and 'defensive would-be lost
to the cardinal through the Injury to
his ankle in the Sherman Indian. game.
Crow is, however, able to leave his bed
and hobble about the campus with the
aid of a cane. Trainer Dad Moulton
promises to have him in the game on
Saturday as good as new except for the
loss of training and signal practice.
Along with tbe good comes the bad
tidings. Tim Brennan, the promising
man for the right guard position, has
not returned to the squad after being
temporarily called off by the faculty.
It is apparent the rumor of a delin
quincy in scholarship had some foun
dation. Frizzel, '06. is the next best
man in line. Besides hard knocks the
men of the big eleven are suffering
from attacks of illness. Jimmy Stanford
has an attack of the grip and is con
fined to the hospital. .
Above all these trials shines tbe de
termined face . of veteran Trainer Dad
Moulton and of Coach Lanagan. Slumps
have ocourred before now at Stanford
and the representatives of the cardi
nal have worked' out: of them.

AT BERKELEY
Glowing Stories Are Told
of the Splendid Form
of the California Squad
BERKELEY, Novl 3.â Secret prac
tice, continued daily on the new Cali
fornia football field during, the .last
seven days, has been used to put those
long looked for "finishing touches" to
the varsity football team. So golden
and so glowing are the reports of "the
big fellows' splendid condition, their
great team work under Coach Knibbs'
masterful hand, and the â¢ air. of ,,' . high
confidence which pervades the football
squad that "rooters," one and all, await
with impatience the day when the
Stanford eleven â¢is . encountered and J the
full fruition of Calif ornials fond hopes
for victory .by a decisive . score are
-realized. ';-â¢ ' '. \u25a0 l^:^'v'-'' : -
Coach Knibbs has proved a veritable
magician. His praises are sounded by
all; for, the results *he : appears to; have
achieved in putting lnto s ' championship
ohape a big squad of football v players.
Where a few weeks 'ago was. heard
whispered distrust and much carping,'
with gossip of friotlon between 'coach
and players that eventually might
"wreck the team." now, Knibbs Is ; a
veritable hero. He is regarded -as the
"god in the machine" -and~ sure 'to' be
enshrined in the, event of California's
victory on the 11th inst.: as a y hero
greatly beloved in the- hearts- of CalK
f ornia' s aons and daughters.
The one 'big feature ;.of Uha football
situation at the university : this, -. year
has been the coach. ; There are players
who are stars and whose > movements
are; watched with -suspended"^ -breath,
and their .'/slightest " injuries studied
carefully; : there are .fights for rplaces
on the team, with all the -warm-argu
ment that accompanies such contests,
but oversliadowing ' all ; else * at . Calif or;

It Is Knibbs" who .seems to 'be .re

new. , He makes no especial effort, to
'.'jolly"- . the varsity men \u25a0' or to become
popular. - : v He v is strictly : business. %.-. He
represents a novelty : in the coach.line.
He .cares little for - the old-fashioned
idea of r .'.Tooting" done ; daily. '^ f or ,;'\u25a0â¢ a
month ibefore /the big game.:/. He\Jjas

The drop kick: has suddenly coma into
prominence again in oollege .football.
Years - and years ago when it \u25a0 was not
\u25a0tylish for any one but tne ; fullback to
kick the bail, the drop kick was extremely
popular.';; At that- time} Uncounted five
points . Instead of ; four - as now, â¢ v Subse
quently 'the place kick' was substituted
and the drop kick became almost obsolete.
This : year , nearly ; every .team i has -\u25a0 some
man \u25a0 who can fall back ' at : a greater or
less distance from* the last streak of
whitewash and drop kick the 'pigskin be

It would seem that in such cases it would
be better to try for the six points instead
of j four, but the quarterbacks apparently
do not agree with this view. It is a pretty
play; and i deserves the place ; in the game
which it now occupies. As long as it re

DUCK SHOOTERS
ARE ANXIOUS
Bay Is Full of Canvasbacks
and Other Ducks Which
a Storm Would Move
The sportsmen owning duck preserves
are anxiously awaiting rain, which would
put In motion myriads of ducks which
are at present reposing peacefully on the
smooth waters of the bay. The ponds on
many of the clubs' grounds are dry and
offer no attraction to the ducks.
Once ; the birds are- set in motion by a
storm or a high wind, the men having
floating blinds, which dot the shore line
of the bay, will have come grand shoot
ing. The surprise of the season is the
presence here of countless canvasbacks.
These toothsome birds usually appear
about Thanksgiving day. but this year
they were killed in large numbers on the
opening day of the season. The birds
were Invariably thin, which is taken as
an indication that they were northern
birds, which had made a long flight.
The shooting on the Suisun marsh last
Sunday was poor, the day being unus
ually warm. Down at the Monterey pre
serve of the Empire Gun Club conditions
proved more favorable and the members
had some satisfactory sport..
Percy F. Dana shot over the Empire
preserve on Wednesday and bagged thir
ty-five, including some splendid mallards.'
Phil Bekeart and other members of the
Family Gun Club provided sufficient birds
for a duck dinner for the Family Club
early In, the week. ;
The quail shooters are also crying out
for rain, the ground being too hard at
the present time for the dogs to work
over. Will Jansen, E. G. Gregory and
Bert Spring . tramped the' San Mateo
County , foothills for hours last Sunday
and saw but few birds.
. Quail are numerous In. the Santa Cruz
foothills, -but the brush \u25a0Is so"*aense that
few birds are killed. They flush on the
approach of a man and are lost In the
thicket.

It i 3 said the account of the Injuries
suffered by James McGregor in an as
sociation football match last Sunday
have been grossly exaggerated. Had it
not happened that he was struck In tha
same spot as he had been previously hurt
when attacked by thugs, little would have
been thought of the injury. Ha was
able to return to his work on Tuesday.
James Lanagan. head coach of tha
Stanford football team, haa retracted his
statement that in the practice , match of
association football at Berkeley one leg
and a collarbone were broken and tha
police had te* be called in. He writes to
Taliesin Evans? president of the C. A.
F. Union: "I was simply unwise enough
to repeat the report of the game which
came to mi. I believed the man who told
ma as he was on the ground at tha time.
I am glad to learn that his report was
not true and I hope you will pardon my
failure to investigate. It was an injus
tlcÂ« to say what I did without being cer
tain of the facts and I am sorry for It."

i Tha second raca between tha Corin
thian and - the Challenger for the San

having been won by the Corinthians.
tha commodore and members of tha
Sausallto club have coma to the con
clusion "- that it would ba useless to
challenge again for tha trophy with W.
Q. Morrow's sloop. It Is, of course, too
early to say what will be done with re
gard to a race for tha cup next year,
but it Is certain that the members of
the San' Francisco Yacht Club would
not, incur tha great expense of 'getting
designs " for and constructing , another
racing * \u25a0:'; machine. They could . hardly
hope to -get , a faster or -.abler fin-keel
boat than the Challenger or a speedier
or, larger thirty;- foot centerboard craft
of. the scow type than the Corinthian.
To = expend $5000 for a boat which
would not be certain to win and would
be useless for any practical . purpose
afterward is more than the club would
undertake. Unless the California Yacht
Club should -challenge for * the trophy
it Is possible next year will go by with
out a" race for the cup.

It tlie Tigers had not forgot hovr to
pick up the ball and toss it around as
Jl siiould have been tossed there might
pbjskbly have been a different finish yes
ierday at Recreation Park. The Seals
were bent on wading: in and the Tigers
were stuck to boot the ball, so after
having a lead of two runs up to the
seventh they collapsed and allowed the
Stais to bneak four in on one little hit.
For a time the game had a cham
pionthip complexion, but the color wore
off in that dreadful seventh spasm. It
looked like a bush content then and did
Dot switch as far as Tacoma figured, for
the Seals were allowed to take advant
ajre once mere and gather three in the
eighth:
San Francisco had the lead, 1 to 0,
till the sixth, ajid as Dick Williams was
twisting 'em right, it looked none too
good for ibe Tigers. \VITh two safely
under the bench in the sixth Emerson
L:t off a single to center. This was fol
lowed by three healthy drives from the
bats of Doyle. Sheehan and Nordyke.
Tfcey all counted and three runs made
Jklike Fisher feel proud. *
The Seals got another in their half of
the round when Hildebrand walked and
registered on Householder's double to
the score board. But the good work was
all accomplished in the next spasm.
_Kmersou passed Gochnauer and Shea
bunted to first. Nordyke's peg to second
was bad and both men were safe. Wil
liams dumped a sacrifice at the plate.
"Waldron blasted the hopes of the fans
by lining one at Emerson and forcing
Gochaaorr at the ulate.
Kid Mohler was there with a two
bagger into the right garden that helped
both men over the jumps. Hildebrand
lined one at Eagan and Mohler kept on
running. Nordyke booted the ball at first
'eMd Mohler still kept on till he was In.
Kmerson also made a wide throw, ad
va:rcing Hilde. Wheeler was trea* to
c i>ass and Charley Graham threw o .sec
ond to catch Hilde. Casey returnee the
, bill wild to Sheehan and in went another
run.
That landslide of tallies took ail the
' light out of the Tigers. They slumped
.ami allowed the Seals to grab three
more fn the eighth, which swelled the
firanO total to nine and made Mike
. Fisher 111. The score: â¢

batted both Hall and Goodwin hard to
day. This, coupled with the weakened
line-up of the locals and their six
I errors, enabled the northerners to win
,by the score of 8 to^. Smith and Ber
i nard were out of the game, their places
j being taken by Toman and Middleton.
I The work of the locals in the field,
I particularly that of Brashear and Mid
| dleton, was raw. At the bat they were
little better and were unable to connect
with Califf's curves. In the last half
, of the ninth inning-, after Dillon had
walked, Cravath put the ball over the
] fence for a home run, scoring the only
: two runs made by Los Angeles. Suess
i started to catch, but was replaced by
; Van Buren In the first inning, Ferry
going to left field. Score:

SAX EAFAEL GOLFERS
ON FAIR OAKS LINKS
Tie Between 3lenlo and Marin
(Teams' to Be Decided
The home-and-home match between
trams representing the San Rafael Golf
Club and the Menlo Golf and Country
Club will be concluded to-day on the Fair
Oaks course. The San Rafael team will
journey to Fair Oaks by the train leaving
the Third and Townsend Street Depot at
10:30 a. m.. and will lunch at the club
house at Fair Oaks. After luncheon a
match over eighteen holes will be played
between the teams, which consist of
twelve men each. The, San Rafael team,
being the visiting one, will receive two
points handicap. An effort was made to
have the tie played off on the links at
Del Monte, it being the usual practice in
such a case to play the deciding match on
a neutral course. It was not, however,
possible to cet the men together for so
long a trip. It was, therefore, agreed to
play either on the San Rafael or Fair
Oaks course, the home team to give the
visitors a handicap of two points.
The first eighteen holes of tlie match
were played at San Rafael \u25a0on Saturday,
October 7, the San Rafael team winning
seven matches to five, each match, wheth
er won by a margin of 1 up or 10 up,
counting one point. The second eighteen
holes were played at Fair Oaks on Satur
day, October 14, the Menlo team winning
seven matches to five. -As each team won
twelve matches out of twenty-four, the
S6-hole contest ended in a tie. which It is
the object of to-day's match to decide.
The Menlo team will consist of almost ex
actly the same players as on the fofmer
occasion, but the San Rafael team will
lack Douglas Hardy and W. J. Casey,
who played on October 7.
The coming golf season seems certain to
be an active one. Three competitions will
be held during this month on the course
of the Burlingame Country Club, the
sixth regular tournament of the Camor
nia Women Golfers' Association, on Wed
nesday, the 15th inst., being the most Im
pcrtant. Though the course of the San
Francisco Golf and Country Club will not
be in good condition until after the first
heavy rains, many players are already
practicing, among them being Dr. J. R.
Clark. S. L. Abbot Jr., Captain J. S. Oys-^
ter. H. A- Black man. B. D. Adamson,
John Lawson, H. C. Golcher, Andrew Car
rigan, Leonard ChÂ«nery, R. I. Bentley and
C. H. Bentley. The regular opening of
the club house and the initial tournament
will not be held until the course' has
been softened and improved by rain. A
competition will take place on Thanksgiv
ing day, it being the practice of the club
to hold handicaps on all public holidays.
The private car service to the Ingleside
couise on Sundays Is proving attractive
and hae already been improved by the
addition of another trip. The car starts
from the junction of Broadway and Fill
more streets at 9 and 10:$ a. m. and at
12:45 and 2:55 p. m., returning from Ingle- !
side at 0:45 and 11:15' a. m. and 2:10 and

Men Who Attempt to^Ring
Freckman as â¢ the Horse
\ Cataract Are xÃuled Off
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
r<; NEW YORK, I |S.^^g^J^^Ad^
Morris Steele, J. V. Wilkins and' the horse':
Freckman have* been ruled off '; the - turf. \
This action is the result of an attempt
to ring Freckman at Jatnaica last Mon
day under the. name' of. Cataract. The
ruling was made by the. stewards of the
Jockey Club to-day, acting on therecom
mendation of the stewards of the Jamaica
meeting. Present at the meeting, which
was held at the' Jockey Club rooms in
Windsor Arcade, "were James ,;R. Keene,.
the vice chairman; J. , H..' Bradford,- F. ;
R. Hitchcock and Andrew Miller. i
The ruling comes as' no surprise to the
racing public. .After the - horse, which
had been entered as Cataract, was posi
tively idcnlfied as Freckman by two form
er trainers no other decision could have
been made. The horse' is still In care of
the Pinkertons at Jamaica track.
An effort was made by J. V. Wilkins
to get possession of the horse under a
writ of replevin, but the Plnkcrtons dis
regarded the ' order and still hold : . the
horse. That the persons ruled off are
the main instigators: of the attempt at
ringing no one for an instant believes.
The adventures of the persons in control
of Freckman from the time the horse
was reported stolen last February until
he showed up at Jamaica under the name
of Cataract would be Interesting and
would reveal persons really guilty.- Their
identity would be hard, to establish and
their movements difficult to trace.

TRADE REPORTS
ARE FAVORABLE
Cooler -Weather Throughout
the Country Has Improved
General Tone of Business
OUTLOOK IS OPTIMISTIC
Work Continues to Be Brisk
and More Cases of Advances
in Wages Are Noted
NEW YORK, Nov. 3. â Dun's Weekly
Review of Trade to-morrow will say:.
Cooler weather in' most sections of
the country has stimulated the retail
demand for seasonable < merchandise,
improving the \u2666 tone of business .where
there had been more or less irregu
larity, but reports are still somewhat
mixed as to collections. There is still
a very close comparison of railway
earnings, which' were only 6 per cent
larger than in October, 1904. Indus
trial conditions are lltle disturbed by
labor controversies, although several
important questions are under discus
sion. : Thus far work is scarcely in
terrupted and more cases of advances
in ' wages are reported. At the South
and West the. scarcity of labor retards
operations, yet those sections are more
prosperous than ever before. Leading
branches of manufacture made good
progress, most mills. and factories hav
ing orders for more remote delivery
than is customary, and especially fa
vorable statements are made respect
ing lumber : and flour mills. It is no
longer" cause for comment when new
records of . output are established, as
this has become the iÂ»ile rather than
the exception.
Failure returns were very favorable
for "October, liabilities falling 36 per
cent behind last year's. For the first
time in recent weeks exports from this
port declined materially in comparison
wi^h the same of 1904, the adverse bal
ance amounting to $4,843,103. Imports
rose $1,903,403. Finished steel business
is still coming forward, a large tonnage
of structural shapes is now pending and
the situation will find little relief in
the starting of several new plants be
cause their output has already been
sold far ahead.
. Forward business in hides during the
past week attained enormous propor
tions, transactions at Chicago and Mis
souri River points reaching: fully 250,
0-0 pounds.
Failures this week in the , UnJVd
States are 202 against 220 last w<i '.
233 the preceding week and 229 the t -
responding week last year. Failures in
Canada number 34, against. .25 last
week, 38 the preceding week and 27
last year.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:
Industry generally shows unprece
dented activity, with iron and steel a
notable leader. The building- trades,
and therefore the demand for lumber
and other, materials, show, unexampled
movement. for this season. The lumber
movement in the Pacific Northwest is
hampered by car shortage. Collections
generally are freer and there are signs
of the return movement from the coun
try, balancing the outgo. Labor is oc
cupied, as rarely if ever before at this
season. Fear of cotton mill strikes has
faded and reports - from factories in
widely separated sections are that they
"are running to their fullest capacities.
. All the : measures of trade volume
point to record totals in business opera
tions, with a minimum of friction, in
the shape of embarrassments. The out
look generally Is an optimistic one and
indicative of: marked activity the com
ing winter. -
Business failures in the United
States for the week ending November 2
number 160, against' l7B last week, 200
in the like week of 1904,. 216 in 1903,
148; in 1902 and 191 In 1901.
In Canada failures for the week num
ber 26. against 30 last week and 20
this week a year ago.
Wheat (Including flour) exports for
the week ~- ending November 2 are
6,293,399 bushels, against 4,267,107 last
week, 1,428,602 this week last year,
4,340,281 In 1903 and 5,715,555 in 1902.
From July.l to date the exports are 33,
255,827 bushels', against 23,934.163 last
year, 58,241,928 in 1903 and 45,539,492 in
1902.

\<-w York Sioek Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. 3. â For tne fourth con
secutive Ccy salts of storks to-day exceeded a
million chares for the day on the Stock Ex
change. This counts the 550 Reading shares ss
full shares. As Reading absorbed the over
whelming proportion of use day's dealings, the
comparison with ordinary days of extreme ac
tivity is considerably affected. The movement
in Reading dominated attention throughout
the s; day. Its moderate advance tj: the mcrn
ing carried the market with it, but In Us
more violent" and. feverish stages its 'effect upon
the general speculation . t>ecame unfavorable,
consequently the market moved contrary to
Reading, the response to all fluctuations being
rtmarkably close. As a result the consider
able gains which were t-stablirhed at one time
were entirely wipea out at another when
Heading w&s In the course cf its higher Sights.
Fears contfnvÂ»e<3 that a- corner in the stock
\u25a0was about to be precipitated which might de
moralize the general market. The conductors
ot thÂ«- principal operations tn the stock vene
mently denied that there was any danger of a
corner, but they persisted in predictions of
constantly hipher prices for the stock. .and a.6
they wore apparently able 'to enforce their
predictions thtre was not much comfort for
; the shorts in .assurances against the corner.
The Fpfeulativfc dread of a corner lies not only
ir. the lorses involved In the shorts, but In the
difficulty of comiiieting the operations, owing
to the residue left in tli^ nands or the con
ductors ot the corner after a settlement with
the eKort* has been emorced. This residue. In
the slang of the market, is known as the
"\u25a0forpse" and offers peculiar embarrassment in
its disposition. The shadow of a threatened
Corner in the market may sufficiently explain,
therefore, the growing hesitation of the specu
lative tone. The preliminary estimates of the
movement of cuiTeucy for vie week was a fur
ther unsettling influencf, owing; to thÂ« Indica
tion of a poor bank statement to-morrow. A
<iÂ«-avy resumption of the movement of cash to
ihe interior is indicated. Of the lose by the
banks of $3,713, C*0 to the cub-treasury, $2,350,
<Â«.Â«Â» is accounted for by the deposits at that
institution by the banks by telegraphic trans
fer to*, .interior points. Statements by the
banks thcmeelve* â¢ indicate that rather more
\u25a0nan this ha* g-one to the interior on the direct
Â«-xpre*6 movement. This would Involve a cash
loss of more than $6,000,000. The revived ac
tivity Jn the *i>*-culatlon seeme to promise -a
considerable' expansion which, would aggravate
the epcroachment of the surplus reserves.
Sterling exchance was firm at a further slight
advance and discussion continued on the like
lihood ot an export movement of gold. "Berlin
discounts rose sharply also, and sterling ex
thange there was lower.
Wheat export* for the week, including flour,
here ifS.i'Srj.^iS bushels, compared with 4,207, 1U*
bushels laft week and 2,831,482 busheli the
â¢reek before. The effect of the Russian .dU-

The demand for Potatoes from points outside

est In the history of the trade. 'There are order?
on: the market from Louisiana. Mississippi and
Arkansas for | fully one hundred carloads, and
numerous â¢; inquiries are being, received from
other States. r River goods are being used to
meet this demand and a trninload of IS cars
will . leave Stockton to-day for New Orleans.
The railroad company has promised to deliver
this shipment at Its deeunatlon - within eight
days. This unprecedented demand for Califor
nia Potatoes is due to the fact that the crops
in Colorado, - Nebraska and other - Western
States, which havo always supplied the South,
are short, having been .greatly damaged by
frost. Most of the shipping business is being
handled by a few local firms, t who have been
purchasing heavily^ In â the river districts for
some. time, and : It Is reported that they have

Trade in 'reah fruits was quiet, as usual on
Friday, but with receipts of everything I light,
the market remained firm. Table Grapes con
tinued in light supply and available supplies
of 'all .varieties cleaned up readily at well
maintained : prices. The bulk of the day's re
ceipts of Strawberries rrom the Watsomnlla
region came tc hand very late and had to be
held -over. Early," arrivals frem .all ; sections
brought firmer prices; The Apple market was
In -good: shape . for fancy stock, but ordinary
fruit was overlooked. The 'other orchard fruits
ruled firm; "even Figs, which had previously
been jin heavy supply and weak, being higher.
The market was practically bare of Canta
loupes and Nutmeg Melons and the quotations
TÂ»ere- wholly nominal.- Citrus goods continued
to' find a ready outlet at steady rates. A car
of Intermediate crop Navel â¢ Oranges was at
hand. from- the Oajl Valley and. several small

HELMS MAKES
TWO ARRESTS
One of the Patrons of the
I Portuguese Citizenship
Kingsters Lies in Jail
â¢ Another illustration of the nefarious
\u25a0work of the Portuguese ring of natur
alization fraud grafters was exposed
yesterday, when United States Secret
Service Agent John H. Helms arrested
.Jdzuino Cardozo Borges for having: in
'his possession and using a false and
:fraui!ulent certificate of naturalization.
'Helms has ascertained that Borges
xjbs born in the Azore Islands on Octo
. ,tcr 3, 1572. Seventeen years later he
. "came to this rity and made the ac
â¢ <juaintance of Luis A. Xunes (since de-
Ceased), who kept a clothing store at
, d Jackson street. Borges wanted to
' become a citizen, so that he might visit
'his native country and return to the
United States without any trouble from
the imini^rat'on authorities. As he
could neither read nor write, he was
fearful, that citizenship would be re
fused him; l>ut Xunes informed him
that for ?15 he would procure Borges
his naturalisation papers without ever
tjoinj? 10 court. He gave Xunes the
, mor.fiv. and Xunes gave him what pur
ported to be his papers. On April 2,
li>o3, Borges went to the Azores, and
â¢had his papers indorsed by the United
States Consul, who affixed his signature
n:id bis seal thereto. A year later,
when he xvas about to return to this
j country, Borges had his papers signed
by the sz.mc Consul. On April C, 1901,
â¢ Lo was landed at Xew Bedford, Mass..
as an American citizen upon the fraud
ulent papers. "When he returned to San
Francisco he gave his papers to another
frson for safe keeping, and Agent
J-iÂ«lms found them in possession of that
jv. .son, whose name he withholds.
* Frederick Somerfielci. an oiler on the
"â¢steamship Ventura, was also arrested
by Agent Helms. Somerfield arrived in
this country in IPO3. and on October
\u0084 1? of that year declared his intention
4n Urn Superior Court in this city of
l/ecoming a citizen. On February 29,
JPO.", eight months short of two years
thereafter, he was naturalized. His wit

twenty months. In his declaration of

THE SAN FRANCISCO; GALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 4, : 1905.
OLD-TIME GUNS
DO NOT SALUTE
Army Officer Tells Why the
Bussiaii Cruiser Lena Did
Not' Get Proper Send Off
The expose of the tardy manner in
which stately ships of war from "other
climes are saluted when they enter and
leave this harbor has created Quite a
furor In army and navy' circles, as well
as all over the State. The story pub
lished in Wednesday's Call regard
ing the . diliatory tactics of Uncle
Sam's men is partly denied by an army
officer, who makes it his duty to ex
plain some of the details in an effort
to put his Government right -with the
rest of the powers. â¢ ...
According to this officer, the Russian
cruiser Lena' made such haste out of
the harbor that It was impossible for.
Uncle Sam's men to get together In
time to give her a parting farewell
and when they did manage to make
ready for the big shoot, the guns went
wrong. , Â«
The officer avers the salute guns are
not modeled after the 1905 type. In
fact, he swears these guns are pat
terned after the kind that were in
vogue when the -Mayflower, dropped
anchor off Plymouth Rock. ' Some one
tried to improve them lately and
make up-to-date breech loaders out of
them, but the Job was not a brilliant
success and when the men tried to
flre a salute the guns began to kick
and snort about and do everything but
make a noise like a real salute. \
AMMUXITIOV MAS "BULGED."
Many valuable minutes were wasted
during this tedious process, says the
officer, and then to add to the troubles
of the marines, the ammunition was
'^bulged," so the result was not strict
ly In' accordance with the ethics that
govern the exchanging of friendly "of
ncing up" between two powerful ' na
tions.
The officer says the Lena had It on
the United States in the matter of good
salute guns. .The Russian managed to
blaze away and salute for a "fare ye
well" and look on with. a look of dis
gust and disdain, while the United
States soldiers were making frantic ef
forts to round their antiquated weap
ons of dignity into firing form. "When
the salute was finally returned the
Lena must have been so far away she
could not hear It. .
In regard to the overlooking of* the
German cruiser Falke, the officer says
Ehe was not entitled^ to any salute.
He Siys she came puffing into ; this
harbor less than a year ago and at
that time was accorded' the shot of
welcome. - But under the regulations,
avers the officer, no ship has a license
to get more than one salute in one
year, so the German craft has no cause
to complain.
CALABRIA GAVE 3 NOTICE:.
In regard to the Calabria, the officer
alleges she saluted from her 1 anchor
age at 8 o'clock and not as she came
through the Golden Gate, as was
stated. This ' time , the blue jackets
knew "what was coming off 'and were
all, ready. Just as soon as the Cal
abria-fired the antiquated weapons of
Uncle Sam cut loose, says the officer.
They boomed away so loud and 'with
so much force that every one seemed
satisfied,' even the officers of the In
coming vessel. . '".' f .. '-'
It looks as If some one should step
In and stake, Uncle ' Sam; to a couple of
good salute guns' so that Alcatraz will
not overlook any ; foreign 'ships: of war
that come this 1 way: ln the future. {Per

F. H. Smith and wife, occupying a
suite of apartments at 62 Eddy street,
suspected that- their landlady. Mrs.
Annie Dennar, "was charging them for
more gas than, their meter registered
and when she taxed them $1 85 for the
artificial illumination of their rooms
during the month of July they pro- j
'ceeded to the office of the gas company
and there ascertained tha,t the quan
tity of carbon of monoxide actually
burned by them during that period did
not exceed $1 worth. Then they caused
the arrest of Mrs. Dennar on ,the
charge of having: obtained from them
about $4 on similar false pretense, and
by promising to refund to them that
sum. she obtained dismissal by Judge
Cabaniss.
The Smiths have announced inten
tion of engaging: another landlady.

Judge Cabaniss sent James Edwards to
the Superior Court to answer a charge of
having assaulted TV H. West of Baden
with Intent to rob. him of a purse con
taining 55. : Edwards and two companions
waylaid "West the night of October 22 and
dragged him into a hallway on Minna
street, near Third, and when his cries, for
aid scared them they ran away. Edwards
was " the " only member of the trio who
failed to escape.'

"Slats" Davis, the baseball . umpire, was
dismissed ', on the charge of having feloni
ously embezzled a diamond pin from Mrs.
8. -V Frances \u25a0 Rose of 624 Geary, street, : and
when be requested Judge Mogan to hon
orably exonerate him, the request was
promptly ; and /caustically . declined.
. '.'But; my taking of , the pin was merely
a 'josh,' " declared VSlats."
;; "I ; fall to â¢; appreciate the ; 'josh' spirit
that led you to , retain possession of the
article f from last May until last week."
ther Judge retorted, "and your oft-repeat
ed '\u25a0 refusal . to â¢ restore \u25a0 it , to ; the complain-:
ant also baffles my endeavor to see- a Joke
in it. -It is not because you are guiltless
that the charge ,: of â¢ felony embezzlement
is dismissed, but because the, value of the
pin, whlch,is f estimated at less than 525,
precludes .possibility ; of ? your \. conviction
on that charge. If the complaint had ac
cused you of misdemeaner \u25a0 embezzlement
it would not , be dismissed.".
