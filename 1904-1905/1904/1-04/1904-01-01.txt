which has been much discussed here for
two days. On the surface everything
is quiet, pending the. answer of this
Government jto the Colombian note of
protest filed by General Reyes, ,the
Colombian special envoy, but the Gov
ernment is closely watching conditions
in Panama for signs of a possible In
trigue. If a revolution develops it is
likely to come about the time the con-:

on Jaunary 20. . > A whinT of Canadian
resentment over the Alaskan boundary
settlement comes in the. shape of ap

such applications must be made direct
to the Government in Bogota.

asked to be exejased and Dr. Herran
will also be absent. This action shows

If the Colombian Government follows
the advice of General Reyes* a'liÂ°idea of

TOjKIO. Jan. 1.â The situation is
growing extremely -critical and it is be
lieved that thfe chances, for war are
greater -than ever.beforc. Peace hinges
on the character Russia's response.
If the Russian reply is unsatisfactory,
it is almost certain that Japan will
fight immediately. If Russia desjres
peace her position will be difficult to
maintain for the Japanese are distrust
ful of her promises.
If Russia's response is delayed for a
week it is expected that Japan will de^
mand an immediate answer. The an
nouncement that Russia is seeking
naval stations in Korea, buying stores
in America and buying coal in Japan
has increased the war spirit of the

NEW YORK, Dec. 31.â The cloae of
1903 finds many people expectant
as to the reports of the financial
I institutions. It has been assumed, with
the changes in valuations of the stock
and bond list since July 1. that there
would be considerable marking oft in
values and in the reduction of surplus
holdings. The New York Life Insur
ance Company is the first of the cor
porations to make a statement. The
applications for new insurance amount
ed to $475,000,000. The new paid for
-business accepted by the company for
1D03 is $225,000,000. .President McCall
states that this last mentioned amount
j is in excess of the previous year by
I $25,000,000. It shows also a gain of over
$130,000,000 in total paid for Insurance
outstanding, which is stated at $1,743.
000,000 in amount, covered by 810,000
policies. The income of 1903 is over
$87,000,000 and Â«i in excess of the In
come of 1902 bv more than $S,OOOvOOO.
The company reports also that it doe9
not invest In or loan upon stocks of
any kind and that no credit is taken
in assets for the excess of the present
j market value of securities over their
j cost value, which excess is over $2,000.
t-000. The total resources erf the com
; pany exceed $350,000,000. Its bond hold
: ings increased in 1903 over $30,000,000.
The policy reserves, as certified by thÂ»
State Insurance Superintendent, and
surplus reserves have been Increased
during the year by more than $35,000,
Â¦ 000. The various bank and trust com
j pany officials predict an easy money
; market and the stock and other ex
j change members appear to be well sat
i isfied that trade stagnation and the
doubtful views of businessimprovement
tartU likewise be -cleared Â» away in the
; early part of the year. The large buikl
>ing and* railroad operations held up by
; strikes' and. tight money market will.
; it is bf lleved. bÂ« resumed very early in
i the new' year. The Government export
and' import figures would seem to ln
drcate that the total exports will fall
a few millions hglow those of 1900 and
be about eaual to those of 1901, but
materially in" excess of those of 1902.
i while the total will exceed
! those of any preceding year and.
bined with the exports, make the grand
total of commerce more than In any
preceding year: also that the exports
'of .manufactures .will exc.eed tfc$se of

We believe that at this and all subsequent

ethical principles and of their application to
teachers' work should be srlven until a code
In the club, in the eoundll and In the asso

and co-operation are the watchwords that have
been adopted, by all leading educational bodies.
These terms, unity and co-operation, have been
employed as general outward expressions for
those ethical principles that underlie the true
profession of teaching.
John. Swetf read the following report
of the committee on "professional ethics,
which was adopted:
. Recent advance in education has received
perhaps Its strongest stimulus from organized
bodies whose chjpf purpose has been the fos
tering of the professional spirit among teach
ers. ...
ETHICS OF PROFESSION.
Resolved.. That a committee of seven be ap
pointed from among the members of the Cali
fornia Teachers' Association to consider school
revenues and their distribution, havlnjf In
view longer school terms In rural school dis
tricts, and a reasonable Increase in teachers'
salaries in accord with the seneral movement
now golnjr on In other States In our country,
to place educational workers on an equal" foot

creased wafrea paid to skilled - workers In In
dustrial and business pursuits.
That we Indorse the recommendation made
by State Superintendent Kirk' In his address
before this association In favor of a moderate
increase of school revenues by attempting to
secure at the next session of the State Legis
lature an Increase of the- State school tax from
f" per school census child to* $10 per census
child: and an increase of the minimum county

by reciting L'Envoi of Kipling's "Seven

lecture to. the teachijrs.' He aroused a
great deal of merriment at the outset
of his address -by imitating methods
in vbgue in the such as
compelling the pupils to take their
b>noks out '.of theit* .desks at signals
from the teacher and upon reading
their lesson to read the number of
the page and the title of the
lesson. Professor Clark said half
the time the child did not know the
name of the author. ' His lecture
abounded in practical suggestions to
the teachex-s on how to hold reading
lessons. His vifws were impressed j on
the minds of the pedagogues. He con
tended that loudnesa in reading . was
unnecessary, as it had a tendency .to
spoil the quality of the 'reading. He
found fault with the method used in
teaching spelling, and also criticized
the primers used by the children of- the
present day.

The officers elected on the previous
day were installed, and an adjournment
taken.
Seventh â We believe it the duty of all citi
zens, and e*?ecially of teachers, to obey -the
laws of the land, , and therefore -we would
urge upon all members of the profession strict
compliance with our school laws, even though
some of them are not In accord with our per
sonal desires. '
.^-Fourth â We believe that fitness for the work
's the only basis upon which appointments to
positions or promotions therein should he made.
We therefore condemn in unsparing terms all
teachers who.. In their efforts for appointments
or. promotions, r'-sort to unscrupulous political
means or appeals .throush sensational new.s
paperS or make use of personal favoritism.
-Fifth â After having sought and accepted an
appointment no teacher should leave It to take
another within the limits of his contract tvlth
outsthe knowledge and consent of his board.
- Sixthâ We believe that it is a detriment to;
the cause of education for one tsacher to
Â¦knowingly underbid another when In compe
tition for the same place, and therefore con
demn such conduct as unworthy of the pro
fession and hurtful to the best interests of the
schools. -Â¦- â¢ ,'Â¦ . a ' - .

. Accordingly we submit the following for
your consideration and adoption:
A good cook" is paid $S0 to $40 per month, a
waitress in a restaurant the same. At the
end of the "year. It is safe to say that the
eojjk'and the Waitress have more money to be
put 'In the bank than' the schoolteacher. Thu
should not be so. And the often stated fact
that we have no difficulty In getting teacfiers
for our schools cuts no figure in the matter at
all. As. a matter of fact . there are not now
enough Good teachers on tap,, so to speak, to
fill our public fcheol demands. Worse than
that, we do not keep all the good ones we
now have.". We ousht not only, to be able to
keep those we have, but we also ought to be
able to induce, others to engage In teaching.
The- r>oor>le are at fault when they do not so
arrange matters that we can keep our good
teachers and also get more of them. For upon
our nubile schools depends the future of the
State; and, for their own protection, the peo
ple should see to It that the public schools are
kept up to the highest state of efficiency.
The last day's session opened with
singing by the pupils from the third,
fourth and fifth grades of the Harri
son Primary School, jnder the direc
tion of Miss Estelle Carpenter. The
children rendered Lacame's "Estudi
antina," Tosten's song and Johnson's
,"Massa. , Dear," very sweetly.
" In the absence of M.E. Daily, pres
ident of the San Francisco / Normal
School, who was scheduled^,- to speak
on "The Training of Teachers" in Ac-
.COOKS HAVE MORE MONEY,
You will remeir.ber that I said, in
this discourse, that my notion, Is that the first
attribute* of a good teacher Is learning. I do
j not mean by that a little learning. For, to
my notion" rtiere is no place where a little
learning may be.eo dangerous a Â«hlng as in
the 'schoolroom. Neither do I mean the other
extreme. For too much learning (If it be just
dry learning) may maky us mad. But I mean,
for" example, this: He who teaches mathe
matics should be a good mathematician. It is
true that many people can add. subtract, di
vide and multiply. But this power will not,'
I think, make tJiem good teachers of even
these mathematical rudiments. I believe I
think that best to teach even addition the
teacher should know, and know well, not only
eubtraction, , multiplication and division, but
also alio the r?f t of arithmetic, :;s well as al-
Kfbra, geometry and trigonometry, and some
of the still higher mathematics would not
hurt even him who teaches the child how
only to count. . Therefore I ?ay my judgment'
is that a good teacher must have learning. To
become learned requires" time. Therefore good
tea< ht*rs cannot be too ycuntr. ' â¢ .
1*he n<wxt requisite o for the 'good "teacher W,
I think, flic proper "temperament. A selfish
person cannot be a good teflchtw. Fbr a selflph
person will not '(though he. might if he would)
be patk-nt with the faults of Â«therp, nor gen
erous to those about him: and a/teacher must
bco rotient. patient patient and generous of
his time, his labor. Ws good nature arid his
learning* Neither can a Blow pe/ron be a good
teacher; for his pupils must be either led or
driven. A glow person cannot lead the quick â
he only restrains them. Neither can he drive
: those who are qyicker than himself; for, in
â¢ stead of driving, he o will soon be led.
>. Â¦ But a learned, patient, cheerful, tactful,
agile, forceful person may make a good teach
er. I pay "may." because If such a person
have not had professional training for the
work he is trying: to do he must, perforce,
I perform his work by rule of thumb, "he handl
i capped by. difficulties that have been over
Â¦ ccme by others, and be nowhere near as effl
â¢ clfnt as he should be. Teaching is* as much
I a profession nowadays as is medicine Or law,
and therefore requires training for it as much
an any other profesplon. The person who tries
to teach school without that training may
succeed;, but br, would ,Â»Â«Cceed a great deal
better and a creat deal quicker If he had the
I proper training. The next (and final) thing
.that, iir* my judgment, is necessary for the
making of a good teacher is enthusiastic de
votion to- teaching as a life work. â¢Â«
Requisites for teachers. *
iJt me first define what I mean by "a good
teafcher." 1 mean by that term a Â¦ teacher
who, by learning, temperament, professional
training and enthusiastic devotion to his lire
work. Is able and willing to really teacn
"school. And by the â¢ term "teaching school
1 do not mean ths perfunctory hearing of reci
tations end the marking of report cards, with
one eye on the clock and the mind divided be
tween the work in hand and sorho ; other, mat
ter outside the school. But I do mean the care
ful, conscientious attention to every detail that
sroes to make ur> the pupil's life within (and
so far as possible, without) thÂ« schoolroom. \ I
mean the careful ntudy by the teacher : not
only of books, but also of the individual pupil.
Remember that It is not always that the
brightest and best 'scholars become' the best
lawyers, the best mechanics, the best Â¦doc
tors on ihe best teachers. But those who,
while not the best and brightest pupils. ' be
come first-class mechanics, lawyers, doctors,
teachers, would better fill their posWons
in life if they had done better work in school.
For .wcrk, either mental or physical, is much
a matter of habit; and habitâ good habitâ is
much a matter of training; and training is, I
think, much a matter of gentle ahd persistent
compulsion; and he or she who is trained to
work in school works to better advantage.
works easier, worlts more persistently, and
achieves better results after school days are
over than does he or she who has not fc,een
so trained. You will, perhaps, draw the in
ference from this that my notion Is that the
schoolroom Is valuable 'for Its training in the
working habit. I" hone you do so 'infer. For
that is my notion exactly. Because the knowl
edge that the pupil gains in the schoolroom
Is not of much practical use when compared
to the Xraining for work, mental work, that is
ther,e. bestowed.
DEFIXES A GOOD TEACHER.
"It ought to take all of one's time
to teach school." he -said. "It ought
to take all of one's thoughts; and if
one's time and thoughts must be di
vided between the schoolroom and the
politician's headquarters, the. work in
the schoolroom must, of course, suf
fer." Continuing, the Governor said:
. ..Governor George C. Pardee was .ac

A-nything that would make noise was
popular with the people.' Horns were
about the proper things, yet a cow bell,
a bath tub or a tin "can of extensive

The hoodlum element did not shine.
No rough tactics prevailed along the

not insulted and fights were not at all

rowdies stayed under cover .while the
fun was going on. .
Market street, of course, was the

The Republican National Convention
has been called to assemble at St. Louis

on Tuesday, May 3.
NATIONAL CONVENTION.
"Section 1373. In the year 1904,
and every four yearB theerafter. a.
primary election shall be held in the
territory and political subdivisions
where the provisions of_ this chapter
are mandatory or in force on the first
Tuesday in the month of May for the
purpose of choosing delegates tb State

such primary election shall be c6n

The State Committee will meet in this
city some time in March to adopt a
call for a State convention. * It is ex

remarked that the Capital. City has
all conveniences for a convention and
that the days and "nights in the Sac
ramento valley are delightful at that
season of the year.
The common impression" that- dele
gates -to the State* convention can be
chosen by county com>nlttees or
through the agency of .the "old fash
ioned" p'rimary is. not correct. The
new primary election law. which- is

in this office." said the. new Incumbent,

not make any appointments until I am

affairs of the office."

PORTLAND. Or.. Dec. 31.â Now that
the Supreme Court has decided that
the initiative and referendum amend
ment to the constitution of this State
was legally adopted, the voters of Ore
gon can make whatever law they please
independently of the Legislature. The
people can put the law-making body
within such confines that it shall have
only the shadow of power, or possibly
they can abolish it altogether. They
can alter the constitution just as read
ily as the statutes. And they can do
all thip in the four months leading up
to a general State election. No State
in the Union possesses r-uch a radical
law as the Oregon initiative and refer
endum, nor any country in the world.
Although its validity is but a few
days established, the initiative has al
ready begun to bear fruit. The Direct
. Nominating League, an organization
composed of many prominent men in
the State, is preparing to place before
the people by thÂ«? initiative" method a
bill providing for direct primaries, for
'years the dream of political idealists.
The adoption of such a law will mean
the abolition of all city or county con
ventions in Oregon. It will permit the
direct nomination of candidates for all
city or county offices.
The bill for direct primaries is now
in the hands of the printers and a pe
tition is being circulated Tor the pur
pose of securing the signatures of a
Fuffici*Â»nt number of voters to" satisfy
the requirements of the initiative meth
od of enacting a law. It is believed
ihst the reccssarv 8 per cent of the
registered TOtem will be easily obtain
ed, in which case the direct primary
law will be plRced before the* p^?JJle at
the June election. Â¦:Â¦'Â¦â¢?
"The people of Oregon hold a new
Â¦weapon in their hands." said, the at

Special Dispatch to The CÂ«H.
Admiral O'Neil insisted" that no de
fective materials ever had been re
ceived from the Midvale works. Under
the system of examination in the navy,
he said, the possibility of an an
archist plot to tamper with shells de
signed for naval ordnance was prepos
terous.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 31.â Admiral
O'NeiJ. chief of the bureau of ordnance,
has had his attention called to a dis
patch from Philadelphia giving: the de
tails of an alleged plot of anarchists to
blow up the big guns of warships of
the American navy by tampering with
projeetiles turned out by the Midvale
Sttel Works at Nicetown. The plot 13
said to have been discovered by the
explosion o? a projectile in the com
pany's works, which injured several of
the workmen and which it was found
had been loaded with a high explosive.
The story is denied by Admiral O'Neil
!i; the most emphatic manner. The only
possible thing, he said, upon which
such a dispatch could be hinged was
that following the explosion at Iona
Island, which resulted in the death of
several men, some shells were sent to
the Midvale works to-be rebanded. and
in the midst of the demoralization as
a consequence of the explosion and loss
of life a loaded shell was included in
the lot.

this was a move to keep witnesses

A few of the questions to which the

Jf they were locked, were they opened

. "Why was it impossible to lower the
afebegtos curtain?"
f "Why did the management permit
ihe vro of arc lights in the flies, with
no device to prevent carbon sparks ig
niting the borders of the scenery and
the curtain?"
"Why did the ushers, as alleged, shut
all the doors and urge the audience to
remain seated after the fire broke out,
instead of doing everything possible to
empty the house?''

F. L. Donaldson, a Iood chief for the

handled a long telegraphic story of
the fire and its harvest of death, un
aware that his own wife was among

and found that she had gone to the
theater he hurriedly . returned and
searched for her through the morgues
and in the hospitals, but to-day had
jvot found the least trace of the misi
ing woman.
VAIN SEARCH FOR WIFE.
Trade houses were likewi~2 laden with
inquiries and answers.
Chicago's telephone service has never
before been put to such a test as from
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon until 4
o'clock this afternoon. Every avail
able operator was pressed into service
and for hours It was impossible to ob
tain connections with some of the out
lying exchanges.
Coroner Treager and his assistants
did all in their power to supply infor
mation concerning the dead and in
jured, but five times the number of
available men in the Coroner's office
could not have accomplished the task.
Crowds besieged the Coroner's office all
day and begged that arrangements
might be made so that they could
view the bodies without delay. The
applicants were promptly supplied
with permits, which they showed to the
police and which admitted them to any
hospital or morgue.
Six bushel baskets of valuables and
trinkets of various descriptions were
gathered in the theater by policemen
ard firemen and turned over to the
Coroner. Among these were fully a
dozen watches, and in every case the
watch had stopped at 3:50 o'clock.
The flre started about 3:15.
"If those doors were locked somebody
wa3 criminal!;- negligent," said Juror
Fine.
An inspection was made of the exits
leading to tho fire rscapes. and the
.iurore were told that the bodies of the
<tead were piled ton feet high in front
< f these dr>ors when the police reached
in* theater.
The jurors then ascended to the top
gallery, where the greatest loss of life
"ccurrcd. Coroner Treager pointed to
the balcony rail, which was bent in
several places, and eaid that a number
of spectators had jumped through these
openings to the lower floor.
WERE THE DOORS LOCKED?
The jurors then climbed the stairway
Â¦ ading to the first balcony. Here the
lush covering of the seats was found
-o be burned on every seat. An inspec
: on was made of the exits leading to
'he fire Â«?sca:>e at the north end of the
building.
'"These doors are much too small;
they should have be^n three times as
large," said Juror Fine.
The iron doors were closed and locked
â¢nnd it was then seen that the inner
i-.ors were so close to the steel shut
ters that they could not be opened
when the shutter** were fastened. This
exit is not sufficiently high for a man
to walk through without stooping, and
when the jurors learned this fact by
personal experience there was much
comment among them.
The jury asked Coroner Treager re
psirding the asbestos curtain that
r-aught when an attempt was made to
lower it. The members of the jury
"hiic engaged in inspecting the stage
frequently remarked that the protec
tion against fire seemed to them to
>.ave been inadequate.
INADEQUATE PROTECTION
pointed out the spot where the fire
started. The seats in the first ten rows
on the first floor were burned, but back
of that the orchestra chairs were in
gcod condition. In one corner of the
Etage was a rile of brass spears and
armor used in the production of "Mr.
Bluebeard." All that was visible of the
1*0 pieces of scenery used in the extrav
aganza were small piles of ashes where
the scenery had dropped and burned on
ihe stage. The steet frames of the arc
lights, one of which is said to have
t aused the catastrophe, were piled in
confusion near the front of the stage.

"From all the information we have
been able to gather thus far, it seems
to me as though the fault in creating
the draught, which threw the audience
into a panic by forcing the flames out
â¢ ver their heads, was due far more to
the action of the theatrical people in
opening the door at the rear of the
theater than to the audience in open
ing the doors in front. The manage
ment of the theater, I believe, assert
that it w.as the action of the audience
thst made the draught which was the
primary cause of the disaster. I may
be wrong, but from the evidence now
at hard I think it will be shown that
Jt was the action of the stage hands or

anything done by the audience in its
attempts to escape."

"It seems agreed that the asbestos
curtain was dropped, but that it went
only within ten or fifteen feet of the

draught. The draught blew the cur

Iroquois Theater. Sellers did not know
just how the fire began, but said he
saw it shortlv after it started. He
threw extinguishers upon the blaze, but
without effect. He tried to pull down
ths drop curtain' or to tear loose that
portion of it which was blazing, but
without success. The fire then spread
with such rapidity that he was unable

Sir Thomas Llpton says sympathy is
best expressed by helping the unfortu
nates, and that if a fund is opened in
Chicago to assist those who have been
deprived of their breadwinners he will
gladly contribute $500 or $1000.
All local and foreign topics of inter
est were forgotten here to-day in the
general horror over the Iroquois ..Thea
ter tragedy. The extra editions were
eagerly bought. The accounts of the
deadly panic were read by the English
people with peculiar sympathy and
horror, for the pantomime season is
now at its height and the London thea
ters are daily crowded by women and
children. The disaster of yesterday
doubtless will kee? many Londoners
from sending their children to the usual
Christmas holiday pantomime.
The afternoon newspapers comment
sympathetically on what the Globe
terms "one of the most terrible disas
ters of its kind in the last hundred
years."
The Globe thinks that in the outset
there could have been no adequate fire
appliances or else that they failed to
work, and does not believe that in this
country any theater management
would be "so utterly helpless."
"The scheme of exits," say3 the Pall
Mall Gazette, "appears to have been
practically worthless."
The St. James Gazette sayÂ»: "The
ghastly holocaust at Chicago teaches
the wisdom of the local ordinance
which requires the Sreproof curtain to
be lowered once every evening to In
sure its good order."
The Westminster Gazette points to
the terrible regularity with which
Christmastide coincides with a great
disaster, and thinks it only shows how
necessary to public security are the
theater regulations, which so often arc
deemed oppressive.

CHICAGO, Dec. 31. â There is still- a wide variance of opinion as to the cause of the Iro
quois Theater disaster. Members of the "Mr. Bluebeard" company and employes of the
theater assert that an explosion started the fire. In this they are contradicted by scores
â¢ of survivors, who say that sometime before the explosion occurred they saw flames creeping
along the highly inflammable material appended to the wings of the stage. They are of the
opinfon that the fire was started by sparks from an arc light. A sensational story Avas in circu
lation to-day as to the reason for the failure of the attempt to lower the asbestos curtain, which
would have' kept the flames confined to the stage had it not stuck when half-way down. It
was declared that; a fire inspector found that a wire. had been stretched from the back of "the
stage to the rear of the theater, to be used in one of the features of the second act â an aerial
" flight over the audience. When the "curtain was lowered as far as this wire it could go no fur
ther. : Members of the company assert that the cause of the failure to lower the curtain was
that the draught due to the opening of the doors caused the curtain to bulge out and render it

CHICAGO, Dec. .31:â From- the action
of a committee of prominent architect's
o^Chicago t to-day may result a recom
mendation to Mayor Harrison to dose
every theat/r in Chicago until the exits
and construction have been examined.
This idea was suggested to President
Beaumont of the Chicago Architects'
Association by W. B. Pridmore, an ar
chitect who lost- some relatives in the
flre. President Beaumont refused per
sonally to make the recommendation
to Mayor Harrison, but called an in
formal meeting of the association, at
which it was decided that a larger
gathe'ring of the members would be
held to-morrow to take action..
Mayor Harrison said to,-night:
"I see no more reason for closing all
the theaters than for stopping all rail
way trains after a disastrous wreck.
There is no necessity of becoming hys
terical about this matter, -although
this horrible disaster has taken place
in probably the safest theater in
Chicago."
The Mayor to-night sent the follow
ing letter to all theatrical proprietors
in Chicago:
"November 2, this year, I transmitted
to the City Council a report o nthe the
aters of Chicago, calling the attention
of the Council to the failure cf all the
theaters to comfaly fully with the terms
of the building ordinances relative to
placet" of amusement. The council
rent thi? communication to the commit
tee- on Judiciary for consideration and
pending a report from that committee
directed the commissioner of building"
to suspend enforcement -of the ordi
nance. .:
"The city ordinance, among other
thing*, requires each theater to em
ploy a fireman to be approved by the
Chief of the Fire Department, to look
after the tire protection of the house.:
1 am advised by the Chief that several
theaters hav- refused to comply: with
this provision of the ordinance. : In
view of the terrible disaster at the. Iro
o.uois -.-Theater-' and pending action, of
the <:ity ; Couhpli. I have directed; the
Chief, of. the Fire. Department to : assign
one. regular member- of. tliie department
to-'ipach.!iheaier-vÂ«Â»>i-^.rnipj_yin_g: with the

have . ; further 1 , directed, the- Chief, in
cases where the ordinance has: riot been
obeyed, to assign two regular firemen
to the duty of protecting the ptfbliq
against fire. The wages of the firemen
will be billed direct to the theaters to
which they are assigned and the serv
ice will be continued until the council
has finally acted on the ordinance."
After dispatching the letter, the
Mayor said:

carried in his pocket. ' . â¢
Chief of Police O'Xeil to-day super
vised the work of helping friends and
relatives "recover their dead. Hun
dreds of persons, grief and anxiety
written Â¦upon their faces, thronged
about the chief's* office, seeking in
formation.. The pressure grew' so
strong that tse.cretary Markham,
mounting a chair, read off 'descriptions
to the "multitude, which listened with
straining 'ears. Frequently persons in
the crowd recognired the descriptions
read by the secretary and started in
horror for- the particular ' morgue
nam.ed as the words fell from the sec
retary*.? lips. ." .' â¢â¢ ' â¢ . . . "
At the .'morgue- the inadequacy of
the means ' of inspecting the bodies
was evident. Only a few. persons at a
time were allowed to pass before the
bodies, and places in the line of ad
mission, were as eagerly sought and
foujrht for as means of. escape were
when the' theater was burning. ' .
"Then came a volume of smoke and
far. in the .rear. of the crowd" we could
see' the' Illumination from the flames.
I had a number of small tools in my
pocket a"nd immediately proceeded to
remove the metal attachments which
held the door in place. This was ac
complished with some difficulty, and
then we managed to force the. crowd
back, probablyan inch, the door then
dropped from its place and. one by
one,' the imprisoned'players were as
sisted into the alley. I walked in upon
the.staKe and found" it a seething fur
nace. The players had been rescued
just in time." -Â¦'<;.'Â¦â¢
"formers, were standing helplessly .and
with agonizicg looks in their faces.
The stage door was closed.
"The massive stage door of the* Iro
quois," said Quinn to-day, "is like
many others of its kind. The two
main swinging doors are used when
jjcenery is taken to or from * the
'theater, and built in the swinging
structure Itself is a small trapdoor
used by. the players in leaving or en
tering the stage. This trapdoor opened
inwardly.* As *I passed it I heard a
commotion and saw the door was
slightly open and,, peering into the
opening, I curiously asked what Was
the trouole. â¢ Then, for the flrstv time,
1 and others who had arrived outside
at about the same* time learned that
the theater was on" fire. The playe'rs,.
men and women and children, had
rushed to this small trapdoor for es
cape, got caught in a solid mass and
were so . firmly wedged together that
they could nflt move. They â¢ were
banked solidly against the little door
and if could" not be opened. Nearly all
the players were in their stage cos
tumes, and- the women, had not- even
had time to remove the' paint from
their faces. We tried to force the .door
'open^- but the crowd was banked up
too tightly against it.

WUh the settlemeni of the strike be
.tween the Kestaurant-Keepers ! â¢ Asso
ciation and the Cooks' and Walters'
Union*, together with the adjustment of
fhe trouble that had existed between
the slauguter-house butchers formerly
employed by. Miller & Lux, peace pre
vails at the opening of the new year.
There are no difficulties existing In thia
city except what there iÂ» reason to
believe will be settled soon. There la
a disagreement existing between the
cloakmakers and their late employers,
but as this is over working hours and
not of daily pay. it can be easily ad
justed* by both sides giving way on
half-considered measures. It Is true
that Johnson's restaurant is refusing
to accede to the demands of the Cooks*
and Waiters' Union, but the fight is
more one of principle than of wages
and hours. Taking all these items of
minor differences into consideration,
there is a healthy condition existing
between business and help.
The State Federation convention,
which meets at Fresno next Monday,
will have a 'few matters of interest
to dispose of. which, it is to be hoped,
will be amicably adjusted. WMat
threatened to give some trouble be
tween the Qarriage-Owners' Associa
tion and the Stablemen's Union has been
held in abeyance with hopes of a set
tlement agreeable Co both when the
new rules are properly understood.
Joint committees have been named to
bring about an understanding.
One of the latest adjuncts- to organ
izations of labor comes from the Chi
nese laundry workers. Even the slow
and- dull Mwngolian has his eye open
to better hia condition by asking for
an increase of wages and shorter work
ing hours.
The following unions have announced
their choice of presiding and govern
ing officers for the ensuing term:
The Btory of these efforts was be
lUUed aln*.o^ is soon as it became cur
rent by a denial that the State De
partment hari heard anyfhing of the
kir.J. o Never; iiel ess cablegrams have
ben senf to United States Minister
Fwtr.son at t'ojwnhagen and inquiries
are even now i>eing made at St. Thomas
as= to the truth of the story that Ger
many, through an agreement with the
North German Lloyd Steamship Line,
1p Fe^king tot exclusive naval coaling
privileges at St. Thomas. The story is
not a bad ov.?, The State Department
has probed similar rumors more than
euro to find nothing tangible. That is
Â»h> this s'ory is doubted in some
quarters. No representation whatever
has been irade to Germany nor. will

taining whit the United States would
do if Germany endeavors to obtain for
herself any exclusive naval coaling sta

of the rho?t important islands of the

A serious collision between a South
ern Pacific freight train and th'e 9
o'clock westbound Key route Berkeley
local train was averted this morning at
the crossing at the new Southern Pacific
freight yards, Shattuck avenue and
Adeline streets, by the prompt action
of '.the -motorman -on the electric train
and the engineer of the freight train.
As it was, the motor car and the
freight engine were, within five feet of
each other when they were" stopped
on the curved tracks. Engineer John
Williams and Fireman Charles Mc-
Kehzie, both jumped, so close to a
smash-up did they believe they had
come. 'â¢'Â¦ -.-. r
The electric train was running rapid
ly, and had pulled into the .crossing
before the warning flag, waved by the
crossing '* man, was noticed. Running
out of the spur track from Hunter's
lumber yards was . freight extra . 1080,
with engine and three flat cars. Just as
Engineer Williams poked his head out
of the cab . window he saw the . motor
train booming squarely across . his
tracks. Conductor. Hawkins yelled to
jump, and jump the trainmen did.
The motorman jammed on his reverse
and his air brakes and brought his
train up standing. - , :
.After the crews recovered from the
shock , they found the electric car so
far over on the. steam railroad tracks
that the motorman was compelled to
back away to clear the tracks that the
freight ' train I might pull out on Â¦ the
mainline.
The Southern Pacific trainmen claim
ed that the motorman had not observ
ed the flagman's : signal and did not
slacken, speed when he , reached Â£ the
curve. The steam road people claim
right' of way over the crossing.

ALAMEDA, Dec. 31. â Theodore
Hartley, prominent in local social cir
cles and a member of a prominent
family, was to-day purged at his pre
liminary hearing in the Justice Court
of a charge of burglary preferred
against him by Livingston Taylor, a
boatkeeper at the Webster street
bridge. Hartley was arrested Christ
mas day at the Instance of Taylor,
who alleged that the young man had
stolen a boat, anchor, oars and jib
from his place on the night of the
Sth inst.
Attorney A. F. St. Sure, who rep
resented Hartley, brought out in evi T
dence that the craft taken by Hartley
was his own and that the defendant
had kept it at Taylor's house for some
months, had paid for its storage and
was entitled to use it when he 'de
sired.- It was admitted by. the de
fense that the anchor was the prop
erty of Taylor, but the latter had
often permitted Hartley to take- it
when necessary, as it was always re
turned. Hartley testified that on the
night when it was alleged that he had
burglarized Taylor's boathouse he had
waited for two hours for Taylor to put
in an appearance at the place in or
der that he, Hartley, might secure his
boat to row around to the . south side
of Alameda. When the boatkeeper did
not return Hartley stated that he
raised the latch of the door, entered
the house and launched his boat, takt
lnÂ£ Taylor's anchor, as he hadv often
done before. It was his purpose, he
said, to bring the anchor back' with
the boat. When the prosecution en
deavored to prove that Hartley, had
broken into Taylor's with intent to
commit , burglary Attorney St. Sure
asked the complaining witness, if he
did not havÂ« a sign on the, door of the
house which read: "Open "day and
night." Taylor admitted that Â¦ such
was the fact and that the sign meant
as it read. This admission. shattered
the charge of burglary and Justice of
the Peace P. S. Cone immediately dis
missed the case against Hartley/Since

â¢BERKELEY, Dec. 31.â Now it is
clubs for men as w'ell as clubs for
women -that it is proposed to found
for house students of the University
of California. The people back of the
scheme believe that it is just as nec
essary to look after the comfort of the
boys as. the girls, so the scope of the
proposition has been enlarged.
The scheme had its inception in the
petition of a. number of 'co-eds. to Dr.
Mary Ritter of the physical culture
department to assist them in raising
the necessary money to sjtart a club.
Out of this petition grew a committee
of men and women, who assumed the
task of raising the necessary money
to form the nucleus for a loan fund.
Then some one conceived the idea of
organizing a permanent committee,
which would seek tb provide. the money
for as many clubs as could be formed.
At first it was intended to assist only
the women, but now the men will be
encouraged.
The forming of these clubs is by no
means a chafity, as .'the money fhust
be paid back in time. The money is
loaned to any regularly organized club
that applies. It takes about $1000 to
purchase the furniture. A clubhouse
is to be rented. The great benefit s
that the members are able to live it
"There is no reason why there
shouldn't be as many .men's clubs as
women's. The men really need more
looking after than the women, and
clilbs -would be of great use to them.
The club promotes good fellowship and
at the same time reduces the cost of
living."
The committee having the loan fund
idea in charge consists of Dr. Mary Rit
ter, chairman; Mrs. M. L. Cheney. Mrs.
Leon J. Richardson Professor George
C. Edwards, Dr. James Torrey Allen,
Professor C. H. Reiber, .. Professor
William Carey Jones, Warren Olney Jr.
and Mrs. Benjamin Ide Wheeler.
cost, the funds for the living being
furnished pro rata by the.n. In some
cases the cost is not . more than ?15
a month for a single student.
"One club for girls has been formed,"
said Colonel George C. Edwards, a
.member of the committee. ",It is to
open at the beginning of next term and
will be conducted along the same lines
â¢as the. Pia del Monte and Enewah
clubs. We have Â¦not gathered enough
money to start as many clubs as we
would like, but. that will come in time.
The funds we have may. be -used over
and over again, because as the older
clubs repay the amounts advanced we
may loan the money to form .other
clubs.

Mr. and Mrs. Kelloeg will enjoy their honey

cottage home Is a wedding gift from the
bride's father and Is situated on Walsworth
avenue a few doers from the family home.
Nearly all of the furnishings are "wedding
presents nnd few Oakland brides have been
to happily and bountifully remembered.
Mr. Kellozg holds an- excellent position in
the general passenger agent's office of the
Southern Pacific.
The wedding of Miss Brltton and Mr. Kel
ijgK has been anticipated with unusual inter
erf In Oakland, owing to the- prominence of
the bride's father, John A. Brlttfjn, Â«who is
r resident of the Oakland Gas, Light and Heat
"Company, and general manager of the Califor
nia Electric Corporation, and also on account
of the ijcpulartty of "the* young bride and
groom. Tretr romance 'began eight years ago
in the Lincoln school, when they learned the
first lesson in love from a. teacher not on the
county's payroll â HUJe Dan Cupid.
The scene of the wedding, this evening was
the home of the bride's parents on Walsworth
avenue- and the artistic residence was like a
bit of fairyland. . The Interior was a perfect
bower of . palms and huckleberry foliage,
through which scarlet berries occasionally
gleamed, while through th'e garlands and from
every nock and corner tiny electric bulbs
shed, a soft light.
The ceremony took place In the library,
wheie me whole side of the room was cov
ered with graceful follagf, through "which In
candescent lights shone- "like stars. In the
center ot this green panel, from the garlanded
celling, hung a large white bell, the clapper of
which was formed by an incandescent bulb.
As the stringed orchestra -played the wed
ding march the white-robed ribbon bearers,
Miss Louise Earl nnd Miss Edna Pohlmann,
formed an aisle through which the bride
passed, leaning en her father's arm.
Her gown was a beautiful creation of cream
silk crepe, i It was simply but exquisitely made,
a : deep shirring- forming the skirt yoke and
four wide tu:ks finishing the long train. The
well-fitting hoalce was low on the shoulders,
the yoke being of lucked net. studded with
penm. A wide collar of point lace outlined
the .joke, on which was pinned the groom's
gift, an exquisite brooch of pearls.' The con
ventional veil of tulle and the shower bouquet
finished an unusually beautiful costume.
Miss Alice Brltton was her sister'a only at
tpndant and wore a irown that was much ad
mired. It was of white novelty cloth and
made with a triple skirt and low bodice thii
transparent yoke being jeweled and finished
with a deep cobwebby collar of rare point
lace. The short undersleeved were covered by
angel sleeves, which fell from the shoulders.
Mls3 Britton carried a great bunch of red
carnations.

They bought a ring- in San Francisco
and then started for Berkeley in the
afternoon. They could not buy a li
cense there, and were directed to Oak
land. They went to the City Hall in
stead of the County Clerk's office, and
finally arrived just in time to catch
Cupid Hanley, who Issued them the
necessary license. With the important
document landed, 'they journeyed to
Alameda, where they were married by
Judge Cone as quickly as the statute
allows. c
It took Charles Landers and Sylvia
Messe, two young people "of San Fran
cisco, an entire day and a chase over
the better part of three counties to gel
the matrimonial knot satisfactorily
tied, and they only succeeded in their
purpose late last evening after a day
spent in misdirected effort. They were
finally married in Alameda, after visit
ing San Mateo, Berkeley and Oakland.
According to the story told by the
bride they started off early yesterday
moming with the intention of being
married ip Pan Mateo. Upon their ar
rival there they visited "a jeweler's for
the purpose of buying a wedding ring.
He told them wedding rings were no
longer in fashion, and tried to sell them
a watch. It transpired he had no wed
ding rings, and for the want of one they
had to go back to San Francisco, as
she would not be married without one
and there was no place in the county
where a wedding ring could be pur
chased.

Fire Chief James Kenny and Town
Marshal Kerns investigated the prem
ises afterward and concluded that the
fire had been set by an incendiary, who
had some motive. The investigation
will be continued in the hope of appre
hending the criminal.
The house was occupied until yester
day by R. W. Alcorn, a plantation own
er of Missisijini, who with his wife and
sister and brother-in-law, J. H. Wise,
had been there a month. The Alcorns
moved to-- 593 'O'Farrell street, San
Francisco, yesterday afternoon,. and the
Wises to 1152 Regent street, Alameda.
They had originally rented the house
from Mrs; J. E. McMahon of San Fran--
Cisco, who owns the furniture in it. Be
fore going they had arranged with Dr.
arid Mrs.. -TV. A. Wilson of Oakland to
take the house, and the Wilsons moved
in to-day, though unaware that an in
cendiary had been there a. short time
before them. â¢ " â¢
A determined attempt was made this
morning by some mischievous or re
vengeful incendiary to burn the cottage
at. 2633 Shattuck avenue, belonging to
Mrs. M. W. Mather of Oakland. That
the miscreant did not succeed was due
to the prompt efforts of George McCall,
whose home is next door to the Mather
cottage. No motive is assigned for the
crime and there was no one in the
house at the time. There was appar
ently no effort at robbery, and so far
as known there is no insurance on the
house. :- ; \
The fire was discovered at 7: SO o'clock
this morning by McCall. who turned in
an alarm. George Heggerty of the Per
alta Fire Company came upon the
scene first and put out the fire, which
was blazing in the basement of the
house. Heggerty found that the fire and
Smoke were coming from a pile of shav
ings, shingles and broken laths that
had been saturated with coal oil. The
house escaped injury, as the flames had
not time to reach the woodwork.

Hugh J. Corcoran, formerly a prom
inent, steamboat man of Stockton, has
begun suit to have his divorced wife re
strained from shutting him oat of his
house. A short time ago she had him
arrested for disturbing the peace, and
he was given his liberty upon furnish
ing. $100 cash bail. In his complaint he
says he is ill and fears she will carry
out a threat made by her of ousting
him from the premises.
After ten years of married life Cor
coran and Ella M. Corcoran were di
vorced about two years ago. The d*fe
cree made no provision for the division
of the property. He says that he bought
his home, at 389 Twenty-second street,
on the installment plan, and that It is
still subject to a $2400 mortgage. He
claims he paid for it out of his own
money, but that his wife now maKes
a claim for it, has threatened to "oust
himâ to catch him out of the house, and
lock him out and keep the furniture."
He says he believes she will do it, and
as he has a paralyzed leg he cannot
combat her. He has appealed to the
courts' to decide their dispute.

Ewp since its inception the.'Kahn-
Livernash contest for Representative in
Congress from the Fourth' California
District has been steadily accumulating
complications to vex the lega.l mind,
but the history of t.he celebrated case
contains nothing mc-re perplexing than
the question that was developed yes
terday. So puzzling Is it that Mayor
Schmitz has called the Election JCom
missioners # to meet at 11 o'clock to
morrow" morrilng for the purpose of
sizing up the Situation and, if possible,
devising a key to it.
Registrar Walsh is the chief charac
ter In the latest chapter of this inter
esting serial. Some time ago he was
commanded by the Elections Commit
tee of the lower house of Congress to
produce in Washington all the disputed
ballots in the contest, and yesterday he
complied with that demand to the ex
tent of shipping the ballots through
Wells. Fargo & Co.'s express to the
nation's capital, his intention being to
follow them there next Sunday and
take charge of them while they are
being used as evidence before the com
mittee. Late last evening, however,
Mayor Schmltz remembered that Mr.
Walsh's official term expires on Janu
ary 7. and that if he has charge of the
ballots after that date they will be in
the hands of a person who has no legal
right to hold them. As soon as this
discovery was made the Mayor's secre
tary, George Keer.e. telephoned to
Wells-Fargo to hold the ballots until
further orders, but there was nobody
In the express "impany's office quali
fied to obey the request, even if it were
not too late to do so, and the proba
bility is strong that the ballots are now
speeding toward Washington. -
Just v.hat the Election Commissioners
can do to disentangle the new compli
cation is a auestion which some legal
experts are trying to solve. It is said
that a few days ago Mr. Kahn, antici
pating iust such a move as Mr. Walsh
made yesterday, and foreseeing its con
sequences, suggested that Mr. Walsh
be appointed a special deputy registrar
to act without nay from January 7
until he returns from. Washington with
the ballots, but the Mayor was unable
to adopt the suggestion, because the
charter specifically provides that all
dep.uty registrars must be appointed
from the civil service list, and Mr.
Walsh is not on that list.
Perhaps the Election Commissioners
may find a way out by deciding that
Mr. Walsh's successor shall n*t be ap
pointed until he has restored the. miss
ing ballots to the Registrar's office, and
perhaps this remedy may be considered
inconvenient. If not found impractica
ble. â¢
. One thin? is certain 1 : The meeting
c-f the Election Commissioners to-mor
row morning will be more than usually
interesting.
The Board of Health yesterday ac
cepted .the resignations of Drs F T
Fitzgibbon and W. S. Hereford as'as
sistant, sanitary inspectors, and ap
pointed Frederick C. MuUer and Joseph
A u Kuykendall from the civil service
eligible list to succeed them. The Civil
faervice Commission only certified thÂ«
name of one eligible for each vacancy"
the Healfh Board in the past having
insisted on three names from which to
make a selection. The name of William
H. Lamb alone was certified for market
inspector, and he was formally ap
pointed to the position, which he Is now
filling.
Dr. Buckley moved that the board
recede from its position demanding the
certification of three ellgibles. but the
motion was lost. President Casey op
posed such a course, saying that he
would never consent to permitting the
Civil Service Commission to constitute
itself arbitrarily the appointing power.
Several thirty-day appointments were
made of employes whose salary war
rants were disapproved by the Civil
Service Commission because thÂ»ir
names were not certified for the"posi
tions they occupy. Â»

tron of the Emergency Hospital, was

â¢ The rich New Year's" handicap at
one and an eighth miles, the feature
event, of the card this afternoon, is
well worth trying for with its $2000
in ridded money. The, field Is quite
as classic: a3 that which contested for
the Chriatmiis handicap. Colonel
Letcher's adjustment of the weights
makes it look a difficult guessing
proposition. Proper- and his old time
rival, Claude, meet at equal weights.

an .opening at the paddock Bullman
slipped through. Turpin was getting
Rroggy and. Mendon won cleverly by

and the attendance was large. -;.;;<
On Tuesday Emily Oliver' ran an ex
cellent race, although she did not fin
ish inside the money. On the strength*
of that performance and because of
having Tomniy Burns in the saddle the
mai'e ruled favorite for the first event.
Burns met 'with some ill luck at the
start and at the wire'!his mount was
totena head 'by Nailah.a 6 to t
chance, piloted by.Kuhz. Idogo downed
the early p.acemakeT The Stewardess
for show honors.
. In the third, number, a six-furlong
selli-ng sprint. Tommy Burns had the
leg up on the even money â¢favorite Matt
Hogan. His "handling .of the gelding
wa? the most ragged exhibition he has
furnished at -the meeting. Aunt Polly
made all the pace, only to be outgamed
and -beaten .a neck i by Louis Wagner,
fhe second choice, excellently ridden by
Larscn. Matt Hogan was .third, beaten
a length. â¢ ' â¢
ONE FAVORITE. LANDS.
" A favorite finally went through in
the mile and a sixteenth affair. "Butch"
Fisher's colt Jockey 'Club went to the
post a 4-to-5 favorite with Larsen in
Uie saddle and won all the way. Mc-
Grathiana Princo, .a 100-to-l shot, pi
loted' by the midget J. Jones, was the
runner . up throughout and downed
Lacy Crawford two lengths for fher
place. Rosarie has gone back, the mare
falling" out of â¢ it in the stretch.
The little Texas flyer Burnie Bunton
fell an easy victim to- the prowess of
Rockaway in the five and. a half furlong
scramble. Burns rode Burnie and from
6 to 5 the price was hammered down
to 9 to. 10.' The favorite showed first
soon after the start and was quickly
Joined by Bell, astride Rorjcaway. The
latter two-year-old possessed, a swell
assortment^ speed aÂ»d disposed af the
firs* choice cleverly by half a length,
Â¦despite the terrific finish Burns made.
Jack Martin, with Arabo. was third.
Xervator did rrot get o away from the
ba crier. â¢
.With the talent divided as to whether
Hoather Honpy or Caronal would win
the. closing mile and fifty yard event,
air . calculations wen? upset. Little
Kunt -went out at the start with Gor
galette, an S-to-1 chance, and was never
lieaded. Heather Honey, which went to
â¢the barrier' favorite, tired the last six
teenth, losing the place to "Caronal by
a length.

â¢ T.ommy : Burhs rode Dick Turpin, and
while the six and a half= furlongs was
figured. ajtrifle far for him, the young

to be made .a 1 to 2- favorite. Daytcrn

Mendon, getting 5 to 1 for their money.

It's iuminbsity and storage of heat, and emission of both
without reduction of its capacity- or volume, make it a
problem jn chemistry and in light". Connecting it with
the theory that our planetary system was originally
thrown off from, the body of the sun, and that the
planets partake, therefore, of the- physical nature of the
sun, except in the quality of self-luminosity, and heat,
science" gets the sugge.stion that the body of the sun may
consist of radium and that its exterior hu.sk, which, ex
pelled into space, formed the planets, contained that"
clement in a less degree.- Theological speculation is in
volved also in the radiiim problem, and the quality of the
new force projects it into medicine, for experiment as a
therapeutic agent.
If must be remembered that- radium is now in the
same staere that electricity was when Franklin ; sent up
Â¦his kite. The progress of the knowledge of electricity
was hindered by the dogmatism of the theologians. As
late as 1755, Rev. Dr. Priuce, of; the old South" Church,
Boston, in a sermon ascribed the great earthquake of
that year to God's desire to punish Ben Fraflfklin for in
venting the lightning rod. He proved tfiis to h]s own
satisfaction arid the terror of his congregation, and cried
out: -"Oh, there is no getting out'of the mighty hand of
God." : . ' ':â¢â¢' " ' . ' â¢' ."
Now science' is no longer obstructed. by theology, and
the wider intelligence of the age Justly differentiates -the-,
spiritual from the material, so that more rapid progress
is made. in prj-ing !into .the great plans and seqrets of
nature, and we; will soon know a}( about radium, v.; .v

paraded up and down Market street.
Oblivious of 'everything but the sights
and scenes that only regale the eye dur
ing the last hours of the departing year,
the men, women and children passed
ana repassed the spot where stood an â¢
aged man. The long locks that showed
above the collar of his threadbare coat
were "snowy white, and the hands that
tightly grasped his heavy cane were,
searfied-.by the years that had frosted,
his hair. ; . "-! ~ V . ' ; 'â¢ ' "' :
â¢ Occasionally, a. smile lighted up the
old man's face, bu.t' it disappeared as
.quickly as it came. Once a party of
young folks," brimful of fun, stopped in
front of the aged watcher. One of the.
party, a boy not yet out of his teens,
poked a fresh, fragrant branch of ever
green into the age-bedimmed eyes. An
other, agirliabout the same age as the
youth, threw a handful of confetti over
the" threadbare coat. A third called him
Santa Claus.
The old- man only smiled, and the
party passed on. It had not proceeded
far when the clang,' clang of a bell at
tracted its attention. An ambulance
dashed by. The jolly trio rushed to a
corner, blackened by a mass of people.
The youth and the two girls saw two
burly police officers lift a limp figure
from the sidewalk. Again they saw the
Snowy locks and the threadbare coat.
"Rush," the officers cried to the ambu
lance'driver. "Carbolic." ; ... .

S37.44O.OOO. The total excavation
amounted to 100.000,000 cubic yards.
In 1900 the number of vessels which
passed through it was 21,571.
It is a sea level canal with tidal locks.
The line was laid -principally ..through
marshes and shallow lakes ami along
river valleys. The deepest cut is .the
Gruenlha' cut at the divide between
the Elbe and the Eider. At this point
the canaJ banks are BlxtyÂ»flve feet

NEW GRAND JURY CHOSEN* .
. ' BY .JUDGE- F. .J. MURASKY
In case a car from each -line, arrived at the
crossing at the same time the car flrsX "ready
to 'proceed has the right of way. This order
necessitates the car stopping 00 the near side
of the street at a railroad crossing, but it does
not susoend the ancient rule to stop on the
â¢farther side, on signal - trom : would-be ' pas
sengers. 'Some of the men â n'ot all of them-r
have'repeatedly refused" to make the two stops,
in the hope,- 1 imagine, that the public would
bo induced, at Junction points, to cross the
â¢street and "beard the cars on. that side.
This company "would not have lf.afpp'ear'.for a
mcivuit that ail of Us men are violating the
rulcn.-or that all are. unmindful of -the public
convenience, for we have many, very' excellent
"and trustworthy employes. But In a. -larKO
body ;of carmen carelessness and disregard for
rules 'will crop.. out occasionally.. .Some men
reach! fernlr.alt 'aheo'd of time and thÂ«n leave
behlYid- time 50 aÂ« to have a lonsr Jay-over- at
the end of the trlD. Both of these practices are
prohibited because they lead to fast ' running
and unnecessary 'dangers. Whenever a man is
detected in this breach of .rules he is promptly
reprimanded "and a repetition of the -wrong:
brings more severe punishment, but even this
does>" not seem to have the" desired effect. Per
haps some .more drastic -punishment must be
mÂ«-tert cut for 'disobedience of the. rules 'as to
stopping and as. to running ahead of time and
leav.tiK behind time, before the practice can
be Rexmanently broken up. The time sched
ules have received my ow.n personal inspection
and ample time Is given for all slops. â¢
It has been a rule of. street railroading,
"ever since the days of horse "cars, to stop on
the farther crossing whenever -any passenger
wished tc take or leave .the car. This rule
is *UH the. rule of- the "United Railroads. It
has also been the custom where- dne railroad
crossed another to give one line the preference
or right- of way. These rights of way- were
supposed to be commuted to memory by the
motcrmen or erlpmen. lt : -was found that this
