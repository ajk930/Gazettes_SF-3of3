is now pending against him. She had
been forced to leave their home, at 3665
Piedmont ' avenue, on account ' of his
treatment, and after a two months' ab
eence returned for a short time to get
some things, when a. quarrel/ caused
him to use the knife. The bladeopened
her check, cut through her collar and
made a wound In her back.
The trial of Lawrence was begun
to-day before Judge Henry Melvin, and
the following named were selected to
sit as jurore: E. A. Kennedy, James H.

' Mrs. Lawrence was -the first witness
called. She testified that when she
Went to the house Lawrence was there,
tinder the Influence of liquor and angry
on account of the divorce- papers that
had been served upon him. She \u25a0 said
that he struck her several times, and
that she went to the telephone to call
for assistance, when he attacked her
with the knife.
Dr. Bell testified that he had been
called to the Lawrence home- to treat
Mrs. Lawrence, and that he found her
-weak from the loss of ; blood. '" She

Coming right on the, heels 'of disclo
sures â of . J. P. Morgan &.'Co.'s high
financial operations with .the "New York
Life Insurance Company, % the * Cincinnati,'
Hamilton and Dayton deal* has provoked
much taiu. in Wall street and ( some *of

As for the Second profit, "whipsawed."
It was announcedltp-day that Mr. Morgan
has organized a syndicate to underwrite
$10,000,000 of , convertible i 4 ; per cent Erie
bonds to pay for the road, and will exact
on the sale of the t bon<l2. ~ .:
\u25a0In 1003 an issue of $50,000,000 , of Erie
bonds was authorized, of which? $10,000,000
were issued a 'year ago, convertible into
Erie common stock at $50 a share. These
bonds said) to-day at 113. The new bonds
arejto be convertible at $60' a share, and
it -is 'supposed 'will sell around par. They
are to be issued to the syndicate at about
92. so that Erie ; stockholders will lose the
difference between the syndicate' price and
the- market price, or at least 5 or 6: per
cent. Morgan"& Co.. will therefore make
double proflt, amounting to about 'lo per
cent, or about $1,000,000.
The Cincinnati, and Dayton
was reorganized about a year ago and
has not proved a success. ' .'lts fixed
charges have increased and it needs j bet
terments, for, which the Erie will have 'to
pay. " But what matter if it is an : unde-;

Startling Report Made
by Secret Agent
to His Chief.
Immigration Laws Violated
by the Foreign Steam
ship Companies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
. "WASHINGTON, Sept. 25.â Startling
frauds are said to have been â¢ discovered
by Special Agent Fishberg of the Immi
gration Bureau, to the effect that it is
tne practice of many foreign steamship
companies to "doctor" emigrants* beforo
they leave Europe so that they will bo
able to pass American inspectors. Fish
berg has been . abroad for seven week 3
investigating the methods of housing and
caring for emigrants. :
The report was handed to Commissioner
General Sargeant to-day and among other
things it ajleges that companies, particu
larly those carrying Italian and Greeks,
house women and children, sick and well,
in the most squalid boarding houses,
where the sick are "doctored" to an ap
pearance of health. The work is said to
be so clever and the deception so com
plete that thousands of persons are ad
mitted yearly to the United States. They
are> said to have the most dangerous dis
eases. -.
In one house, Fishberg says, fifty sick
emigrants ' beinff cared . for in . one
room.*^,They j jhad4bj>en -rejected , by : the
ship's ; surgeon '- as - cases" that .' would not
pas 3 muster. .The man in charge boasted
that he would have ; them "tlxed up" so
that they, could get into the United
States. .
The system of "doctoring" has led to
another evil. Quack doctors impose upon
those who. have. been finally rejected and
rob "them under the pretense that they
will be accepted Into the United States.
Flshberg says he saw the ship surgeon
pass under ,the eyes -of ship agents two
cases of deformed hands, a case of small
pox, one of ' locomotor ataxia and one of

STOCKHOLM, Sept. 25.â The text of
the protocol signed at Karlstad Satur
day by the NorÂ»'fÂ£ian-SwÂ«scUsli dele
gates appointed to arrange the terms
for tha <3i^S'.!tn:r>:i of the ur.!on of Xor
ivay and Sweden, subject to the ratifi
cation of the Riksdag- and Storthing,
\vere piven out to-day. The historic
Gi/ctiraent. which will become a treaty
v.-hen ratified by tho two parliaments,
consists of five mam articles and two
eal>-cJauÂ£cs. The tirst article deals
with arbltrationi; the second withÂ»the
i!*;utr ; j sola- and the demolitiou of
lortiaca lions; the third with reindeer

for the compulsory arbitration before
The Jlagrut- court of all disputes except
matters of ritaJ interest, for the period
of a decade, with extensions for other
periods of ten years unless two years'
previous notice is given of an intention
to abrogate it.
The treaty provides for a zone on
tether side of the frontier which shall
forever bo neutral and for the demoli
tion of the fortresses within that zone,
v.-ith the exception of the old portions
Â«f the formications of Fjederickston,
Gyldenloeve and Overbjerget, which
may renjain, but which are not to be
used as fortilications. A headquarters
starr and garrison may be maintained
ul Frederickstcn. to the extent as prior
to the erection of the new fortifications.
No extensions of the Kongsvinger
group of fortifications will be per
mitted, uor of the new forts erected
within ten kilometers of the old for
tress of Konsrsvinger.
X.VSIKS OP SIGXEUS.
The protocol was signed for Sweden
fey Christian Lundeberg. the .Premier;
Count A. F. Wachtmeister, Minister of
Foreign Affairs; Hjalmar Hamrriar
skjold. Minister of Kducation, and Karl
Â£iu.ff; and for Norway by Christian
Michelsen. the Premier; Carl D. Berner,
President of the Storthing; J. Loev
land.^Minister of Foreign . Affairs, and
BeaJ&mfn Vogt, former Minister of the
Interior.
Almost without a dissenting voice
the people of Sweden, so far as can be
judged by the expressions of the press
htrre and elsewhere, received ./ith satis
faction the terms uetwein Norway and I
Sweden reacr.ed at Karlstad. The j
Cescra] opinion is voiced by the Social |
Democrats, which in Its leading edi
torial this morning says: ;
"Our principal objects, arbitration
and the demolition of the frontier forti
fications, having been attained, we
trust that everybody in both cour. tries !
vrill recognize that the two Scundt- 1
navian peoples mutually need each
other's friendship and that the, agree
ment will bring more happiness to
both."
In an interview, Christian Lundebcrg.
the Premier, who was one of the Swedish
commissioners at Karlstad, said:' "I am '
satisfied that the result of the confer
ence will be satisfactory to Sweden, as \u25a0
with a few modifications we gained al- i
most everything asked for by the Rlks- j
dag. The re-suit also ought to be satis- ;
factory ,to Norway as she gained the as
surance of that independent position
which has been the goal of all of the
efforts cf the Norwegians. The cone-: 6
sions made by the Norwegian delegates
at Karlstad wÂ«rÂ»Â» necessary. Considering
â¬v<ryih!ng and in the interests cf peace,
if Is hoped that the preliminary treaty
will be rat!fli?d by both parties.
According to information received the
mutral zone provided for in the agrte- ;
dent includes an area varying, from three
to twelve miles on each side of â¢ the
frontier. On the Norwegian side the zone
runs from the northwestern point of
KirKocn to the point where the Ulvan
crosses the sixty-rirst meridian. The coast,
zones meet rathtr closely because of the
pofcSibility of having to fortify agahurr
â¢a. foreign enemy. The arrangement with
itgard to the fortresses. It is" believed,
will be satisfactory to all parties.
HUMANITARIAN SPIRIT.
. Expressions of pleasure; are heard
.everywhere because both sideE: have
recognized the humanitarian principle to
,j>ermit the Laplanders to enjoy pasturage
for their reindeer undisturbed. is
'. particularly pleasing to the Swedes from
a sentimental standpoint, as the rights
of the Laplanders are looked upon as
time-honored. The settlement of the
.transit question establishes a foundation
for peaceful Intercourse between} the two
,countries.
CHRISTIANIA, Sept. 26.â A1l Indications
point to ,the acceptance by Norwegians
generally of the terms of the agreement
n ached a.. Karlstad, though at present
-some persons are inclined ito severely
criticize the Norwegian commissioners for
' conceding so much to Sweden. As far aa
s-lhc Associated Press has been able to
"ascertain the results . meet the "approval
of the great bulk of conservative opinion.
The press as a whole accepts the situa
tion, though a few Chauvinists continue
to voice iheir opposition to the agree
ment. The provincial press also appears
to accept the result with equanimity,
The Verdensgang this morning says:
"We must acknowledge that our dele
gates obtained as much as possible and
that a large majority of the people of
the nation agree with the delegations
;that the question of fortifications was of
secondary importance, considering the
"undoubted security obtained by Norway
as the result of the convention."

German Farmer Sends Money

Passage to United . States
6rÂ«cial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 25. â His hopes of
bliss dashed to earth and his faith in
womankind seriously shaken, Fritz
Schultz returned to Metuchen, N. J., to
day aftera visit to the Ellis Island im
migrant station, where he had. reason
to believe his sweetheart, Freda Luhrs,
was anxiously awaiting his coming.
She was there, he found, upon' his ar- :
rival, having come as a passenger on
:tbe'"Hambunr v of ;the Hamburg-Ameri
can line, and ..Bhe- -was" anxious, -tjo
doubt, but not, because she. might not
see Frits. Her anxiety, was because of
the fact that, although the , savings of
Fritz had been spent, for her passage
money, she had, arrived as Frau August
Wagner, and Herr AVagner was with
her. ' Fritz at once recognized in him a
hated 'rival for' . the* Hand, "of- Freda;
whom .be, had letjt- behind, in the German
town of Dusseldorf. '' ; -\\i '.â¢;"\u25a0 *-Vj.'. "
To the iromlgration'officials Fritz told
the story of his'coming to America two
and a half .years ago to nialce a home
for his intended bride. He found em
ployment in Metuchen and prospered
until now he had a little farm of his
own. Joyfully and with Freda's con
sent he had set the wedding day for to
day.
-Without a word Fritz turned back .to
the ferry to go to the New York Shore
depot and thence to Metuchen. 1 The Im
migration officials looked over August
and Freda and decided that they" would
be valuable acquisitions to the ranks of
German-Americans in thÂ»> United States
and passed them through the lines.

CHICAGO, Sept. 25.â Oberlin M. Car
ter, former captain in the United States
army, who was released from the
Leavenworth penitentiary some time
ago, after having served a five-year sen
tence on a chargre of having embezzled
several hundred thousand dollars from
the United States Government through
construction contracts, returned to
Chicago to-day and was examined be
fore Special Examiner Richard Wyman.
The former officer has completed his
sentence and is now spending his time
and money *in helping ? the Government
in its efforts to recd'ver money and
property, alleged to have been em
bezzled by Carter while Government
engineer at Savannah, Ga. ~"" â¢
The matter now in question is in con
nection with- civil suits filed in the
United States . Circuit Court against
Carter and some 'of his relatives for
the, recovery of the property. The en
tire case has been 'referred to Special
Examiner Wyman to take report. Car
ter has aged considerably, but he with
stood a hard cross-examination In an
apparently fearless manner. During
to-day's examination an effert was
made to show that previous to. the real
conspiracy Greene and Gaynor, the
constructors alleged to have been
implicated with Carter in defrauding
the Government, had lent Carter money
and placed 'him' in a position so that
when he was made engineer incharge
and had the letting of contracts; they
might- have a claim upon him. 'Carter
declares that he never borrowed money
from Greene or Gaynor. but that he had
written; them concerning his invest
ments so that they could also invest.
The examination will be taken up again
to-morrow.

Doubt Story That College

Special Dispatch 'to The Call.
NEW YORK, -Sept. 25. â Friends of
William . Scollay Whitwell, Harvard
senior, who disappeared . mysteriously
on February 6," 1003, while returning
to his home in this city, were keenly
interested to-day by Carl Fischer/Han
sen's statement that a. lawyer in-'.'Al-"
,bany Wednesday will ask Governor
Higgins to puruon a college student
now in New York fatate yrison, . who
pleaded guilty tv a cr.arge of burglary
to save a woman's honor. Han sen de
clined to say whether the my.n of his
romantic tale is the long missing Har
vard student. - . \
, Cutler Whitwell, student at Colum
bia, asked Hansen to-day if he had any
news of his missing brother.
"I, have nothing to say," said the
lawyer. .' . .
"Either, the story is pure fiction, or
you are holding back" facts j which I
should know, I .' said Whitwell.
"If you wait until Wednesday when
Governor Higgins returns to Albany
you will know all," returned the at
torney. ;
Mr. Whitwell said upon leaving the
lawyer's office he did not believe the
man in prison is his brother. The
warden of Sing Sing prison said he
knew of no man there who answered
the description "of Whitwell. At Al
bany the Governor's pardon clerk said
he did not read any application for
the pardon of an innocent man who
pleaded guilty to save a woman.
â¢PRISONER NOT WHITWELL.
Uncle of Harvard Student Saya Burfflar
In Not His Nephew. â .
L. H. Bonestell, uncle of William
Scolley Whitwell, yesterday stated that
the family had -positive proof that his
nephew is not the young man held, in a
New York prison as a burglar and who
is said to have confessed crime to shield
a woman's honor. When the report first
became public a month or so ago he
compared the dates published with the
time young Whitwell disappeared and
found a discrepancy of almost a year.
Not satisfied with these dates, he at
once telegraphed to Mrs. Whitwell,
mother of the boy. who lives in New
York, and she investigated the matter
thoroughly.
| According to Bonestell, the 1 prison
records were searched and a phono
graph of the man obtained. The picture
is not a likeness in the slightest degree
of young Whitwell. The prisoner, he
claims, is a much older man, and the
only ground they have for taking him
for Whitwell is the fact that he is a
Harvard student and claims his home
in the West. , ; - :.\u25a0-'

himself last jni^ht i He w^s^fpund.^dgad
in his bed th'lfe morning. * Norton* wired
to his bed a tube, one end of which he
placed in his; mouth and the other end
he^jittached to a gas fixture in such a
way' that ey^n after hei had lost con
sciousness the deadly fumes would still
'pour into his lungs. By a small check
valve which he had invented, and which
he placed in his mouth, the contents of
his lungs were* exhaled into the room,
but nothing but the gas could be in
haled. . He. then wrapped his head in a
blanket, as he had opened \u25a0 both \u25a0 win
dow's of his room, evidently fearing
that if the gas escaped Into the house It
would alarm. his family.
Norton was about forty years old and

Arthur 1,-ee .Springs a Big
Sensation in the Trial
of the Xeni County .Legis
lator Accused of Boodling
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 25.â Another sen
sational chapter was added to those al
ready unfolded in the trial of ex-State
Senator E. J. Emmons, when Arthur. Lee,
a eplored attendant employed during the
last session in the â¢ Senate cloak . room,
confessed on the stand to-day, tnat he
had received three of â¢ the packages of
marked bills from three of the men now
under indictment', and had kept them in
his possession for:, several days at least.
The testimony did not show where the
bills had finally gone and the question
of their disposal is the all-important one
to those closely interested in the trial.
The prosecution will conclude its side
of the case to-morrow.
It was to Lee that the marked- bills
prepared in San Francisco for delivery
to the four State Senators now accused
were entrusted. Such was the main testi
mony. Lee, the negro in question,, made
a full confession of the part he took
in the affair on the witness stand in
Judge Harts court to-day and the last
surprise of the prosecution created a stir
that was almost equal/to the appearance
of Harry Bunkers as a witness for the
State. ' :*:#\u25a0"''"?*& \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 ' -:<--\u25a0
Lee. who has been in custody as a
witness since the early part" of this
month, affirmed that three packages of
the marked- bills were In his posses
sion for at least a day, or two, and that
he had an opportunity to the
numbers and descriptions with a pub
lished account in a San Francisco
paper. He told of one ineffectual at
tempt which he Pays was made to dis
pose of them, but the final disposition
made of the incriminating currency
was not disclosed either.by the prosecu
tion or defense.
When court'adjourned there was but
one question in every mouth, What
had become of the marked bills? Bun
kers-told of the efforts made to get
them together. Lee ' to-day- added to
this -a declaration to the effect that
he was for a time' the -custodian of
threV'of c tne four packages, and once,
while oh' the 'lsland;' he testified that he
had taken them to William H.Hanlon.
This, however,- was stricken out as
unresponsive, and the examining at
torneys appeared careful not to ask
what was finally done with them.
Lee told of having received three en
velopes. (The first, he. said,- contained
the money paid to Emmons and con
sisted of seven $50 bills which he af
terward ascertained to be those.enum
erated in the paper, and in audition' a
roil of currency of smaller denomina
tions amounting to $115.- There was
no attempt at an explanation of the
presence of this money in the envelope.
Next, according to Lee, Einmons had
given him Wright's envelope, which he
testified contained seven fifty-dollar
bills and $420 above this in twenty, ten
and five dollar greenbacks. He had been
instructed, however, , to dispose of the
fifty-dollar bills only, , from which it
might be inferred that no suspicion at
tached to the other bills.
Lee's testimony would indicate that
.French disposed of his roll 'of bills, as
he had gold, ; which, was exchanged for.
greenbacks. when the effort was made
to collect all the marked money. This
is the only evidence tending to show,
that any of the bills were put in circu
lation and it is, by no means regarded
as conclusive. .
At the present time there is nothing
to show where the money finally landed.
"I first saw Senator, \u25a0Emmons,"/ said
Lee, "after the expose at his 'desk, and
later, I should say about fifteen minutes
afterward, he joined me : in a' small
space behind a partition in the ser
geant at. arm's room. No one else was
there at that time." . â¢ \u25a0â¢-.
"What 'occurred at that time?" -was,
asked. . -\u0084 w
"He took an envelope out of ..his,
pocket and gave it to me, saying that'
he did not want to be arrested with any
money on him. ' We did , not talk any
more that day about the bills, but I Baw
him alone the next morning in his room
at the State Hotel. There he told: me
that he wanted me to take the envelope',
to a certain place. He wanted me to go
to Senator Wright and he would give
me a package. "I sa.w" him in his x*oom
again half an hour later." . -
"What occurred?"
"He told me to take the money he had
given me the . day before and also : Sena
tor Wright's' money, and to give them to
Dr. Matthews, ' in the Capitol building,
who would give them back to Jordan."
"What was in the envelope given you
by Senator Emmons?"
"There were seven $50 bills and $115; in
$20, $10 and $5 greenbacks.; The .$5O bills
were inclosed by an elastic and the rest
were Just folded." /X/ K
"Did you receive any other package?"
"He 'gave me Senator, Wright's money
next day. It. was In an envelope sealed:
up and it contained seven $T)o* bills and"
$420 in $20, $10 and $5 greenbacks. "They
were arranged in the, came way as the
others." ;. y. Â» ' \u25a0 . *
"Did you . examine or compare the
bills?" ,
. "I examined and compared them in the
basement under the - Senate, 'â¢: where the
wood was kept.", ', * .'.. '"
"How .did ,you compare them?" *
"By, the Bulletin of January 30; by -the
figures and -tetters that were 6aid to have
been ! on the bills. I tound that they /cor

Lee identified the copy of the , Bulletin
and pointed out the "article referred to.

HUGHES ASKS INFORMATION]
Pacific Mutual Must

' Business.
Inquisitor Wants Ao
/See Company's
-i\.ccorvj. is.
The coming investigation by Inquisitor
Hughe's as to /how much money the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of
New. York paid : to the Pacific Mutual Life
Insurance Company -for the "industrial
policies" of- that company is liable to
bring out. some^very interesting facts. \u25a0\u25a0--
; George A: Moore, the president of the
Pacific Mutual Life, has been in New-
York and is now on his way to this cny.
Secretary.S.' M' Marks, in the absence of
the president, j said he did not feel at
liberty to give out any information re
garding the arrangements by which the
industrial policies were cold to the
Metropolitan Company, but he freely ad
mitted that his company had closed- out
those policies to , the rival company and;
that now no competition in. that line ex
isted here.' -Hugifes is desirious of know
ing, just what- amount the. Metropolitan
paid the Pacific Mutual for its California
business. ; ; . .
In -order to get hold of these facts it
will be necessary for him to see the/rec-.
ords showing this transaction, and this
he will attempt to do through President
Moore. . â¢ Whether Moore will disclose
these facts is not known.
The purchase of the . "industrial poli
cies" by the Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company from the Pacific Mutual Life
Insurance Company, was .consummated
about three years ago. Since that time
the Metropolitan has had a monopoly of
the business and has made thousands of
dollars, practically all from the earnings
of -the laboring classes, who' to a very
large extent are the policy holders in this
class of insurance. This industrial or
weekly payment Insurance is really a sort
of burial insurance and.it is aimed for the
poorer classes. By the payment of 10 or
20 cents a week â they are sure of $100 to
$200, payable at death, to. rrreet funeral
expenses. Now that the Metropolitan has
no competitors in the field it can charge
what It likes. The company can therefore
enrich itself at the policy-holders' ex
pense.

KAHN GOING TO OHIO.'
Yesterday. Julius Kahn, Congressman,
Fourth District, San Francistb, received
a cordial invitation to speak in Ohio dur
ing the coming campaign in the Buckeye
State. The request for Mr. Kahn's elo
quent assistance comes from Senator
Charles Dick,, chairman of the Ohio Re

terday Mr. Kahn remarked:â l have about
decided to accept the Invitation. I shall
visit Seattle first and remain there about
ten days, and then return to San. Fran
cisco. A week later I will go Easr and
report for duty in Ohio."'
Congressman Kahn authorizes The Call
to say that he supports John S. Partridge,
the Republican nominee for Mayor. More
over, he entertains the opinion that Mr.
Partridge will be elected. "I . know," â¢ said
Mr. Kahn, "what it is to go up against
double-shotted* fusion. I had an experi
ence in one campaign. The voting ma
chine will help Partridge. Republicans
and Democrats will not take chances with
the machine. "When the knob is turned
down for the party column the voter will
pull the lever and vote the ticket straight.
No, I shall not make any speeches in San
Francisco during the municipal contest,
but I am for the Republican ticket." \
The Democratic municipal convention

The Davis will contest was resumed
yesterday before Judge Kerrigan. Al
most the entire day's proceedings were
devoted to the submission of samples
of the late capitalist's handwriting by
the attorneys for Mary G. Stone and
the Union Trust Company. Richard
Belcher, an attorney of Marysville, oc
cupied the entire day identifying the
handwriting. Belcher is the son of Su
preme Court Justice Belcher, who as
sisted Davis in acaulrlng wealth
through his- valuable legal knowledge.
A picture of the Judge is in the court
room as an exhibit, having been ' re
moved from Davis' office with the other
effects now in court.
Attorney Belcher had had much cor
respondence with Samuel Davis, and
was able to Identify the evidence sub
mitted. â¢ !
At the beginning: of the morning ses
sion William B. Reis, son of the late
Ferdinand Rels. who was a life-long
friend of Samuel Davis, took the stand
to tell of the finding- of additional
papers in -the office desk of Davis.
The first day of Reis' testimony was
devoted to a description by him of the
business and social relations existing
between the late capitalist and the per
sons, mentioned in the codicil. lie de
scribed how Davis erratically cooked
his own meals at the office" so as to
secure Just what food he wanted, and
told of the assistance given Davis by
Robert Day, James Kane, George Green
and Mrs. Bessie La France.
Reis supplemented his testimony re
garding: Davis' sickness and death at
the Lane Hospital by saying- that the
old man was delirious before he died
and became -so boisterdus as to compel
his removal to another* ward, where he
died.. Part of the time Davis failed to
recog-nlze him and imagined the nurse
to be Mrs. Reis.
An interesting glimpse of Davis" life
was given when Reis told of Davis'
attachment for a dog- that he had raised
from a puppy. Reis said that Davis
thought more of the dog than anything
else, and when It became old took every
means to prolong its life.- .When the
dojj died Davis packed Its body In a
box and took it to the train, having it
shipped to Reis' ranch at Alamo, Con
tra Costa County, where it was buried
with due ceremony. , .
When Belcher took the stand the pro
ceedings dragged while . the attorneys
discussed tach bit of handwriting- be
fore submitting: lt'for identification by
the witness. Each document so pre
sented was marked by the clerk and
will have great weight in determining
the genuineness of the writing of the
codicil. .
It was rumored that Attorney P. F.
Dunne, for the contestants, had .re
tained the handwriting experts of San
Francisco, thereby compelling .the
other side to send East for experts.
Mr. Dunne's explanation is that no ex
perts . were retained or employed .by
the contestants until they had been
used 'by the proponents and had'pro
nounced the codicil a forgery. In con
tradiction of this the defense promises
to bring forward reputable .business
meji of San Francisco, acquaintances of
Davis, -who heard him speak of the ex
istence of the codicil.
Among the spectators of yesterday's
proceedings were Mrs. Mary G. Stone,
Mrs. Henry W. Davis. Miss. Mara Belle
Davis and Miss Pomeroy, daughter of
Carter P. Pomeroy. attorney for the con
testants. On the proponents' side of
the courtroom ': sat Mrs. Charles Davis,
Mlss.Barah Louise Davis,. Hiram Davis,
Mrs. W. D. French and Samuel ; Davis
French ;of New. York. . together with
their attorney, H. ; H. Frost* Jr.

TWO MURDERS OPEN A HIGHBINDER
WAR IN THE CHINESE QUARTER
Lew Dock, Merchant^ and Lee Moy,
Restaurateur^ the Victims.;
Brothel Keepers Debt Paid With Life
and: Retaliation; Follows.
Two mnrden opened a war which has
broken ont between the Hip Sing; Tons
and the Plnff Konff Tong In the Chinese
quarter last ' night. Lew Dock, a
wealthy merchant, fell the first victim
in the struggle,' and the tons to "which
he belonged uttered Â»vrl ft retaliation by
\u25a0laying Lee Moy, restaurant proprietor,
\u25a0 short time afterward. Dock's body
was pierced by three bullets and his.as
sailant^ Louie Ilinff, was captured. ..The
latter had . made complete preparation
for escape. He disguised ' himself :by
whitening his .features and donning
American garb and he wore a wig
'which concealed his queue. ..' , . .
Lee Moy, stupefied by opium, lay on a
bunk in the rear of his restaurant when
three gunmen entered. They opened
fire and JToy rolled to the floor. He had
been shot through the head and the
body.
The trouble between the two tongs is
the result of an attempt on the part of
the HiÂ» Sing tong to collect some money
from the keeper of a brothel in Sullivan
alley. It is related how Ah Monft, the
keeper, decamped from this*city some
time ago, leaving bills to the extent of
$17,000. One itemâ a matter of $400â was
due a member of the Hip Sing tong. 1 The
creditor complained to headquarters and
it was decided, the keeper being without
their reach, to collect the money from
one of his women inmates, who was sup
posed to have been the recipient of more
favor than the other women. The
mand was made and was indignantly re
fused by the members of the Ping Kong
tong, to which Ah Mong belonged.
RESORT TO STRATEGY.
Then the Hip Sing tong is said to have
resorted to strategy. At any rate it
threatened the woman with arrest if she
did not produce the money, and ignored
her plea that she was penniless. A few
days ago a warrant, sworn out In' the
little town of Alviso,.and charging the
woman with grand larceny, came, in com
pany with a Constable, to this city. The
game of arresting Chinese women on
foreign warrants and on trumped-up
charges is an old one, and when the Con
stable went to claim his prisoner he was
nearly mobbed by the irate friends of
the female. Had it not been for the
timely arrival of a large squad of regu
lar police he would never have succeeded
in his mission and would have been badly
beaten.
After the prisoner had been taken to the
Hall of Justice, : protesting all the time
that she was innocent, she was sent to
the southern township and released on
$1000 cash bail! Then, irf company with
her friends, she returned to her home and
has been under guard ever since. While
all precautions havo been taken by the
Ping Kong people, messages and threats
have been received daily from the Hip
Sings. The latter association persisted in
Its demands, but the woman remained ob
durate and the keeper's tong took up her
fight in earnest. When the creditors's tong
realized that the srame of r arrestingr^the
woman was unavailing a threat was sent
to the Ping Kong tong that, if the money
was not paid within a certain time," the

LONDON, Sept. 26.â Special dispatches
from Budapest indicate that the excite
ment consequent on the strained relations
between the Crown and the- United'op

HIGHBINDERS SENT. FORTH..
The Hip Sings sent forth highbinders
to do the promised deed. One olT these,
Ah Song, was arrested Sunday night
with a murderous looking dirk in his
possession as he waited in. a doorway
on Dupont street for_ an approaching
foe. Several others were; frightened
away by the police j and sought refuge
in \ stores and . houses. The vigilance
of r the officers prevented any attempt
at violence and the night 'passed with
out: a crime. Last r\ight the gunmen
started out again. They chose a time
early in the evening when the majority
of the Chinatown squad was 'at dinner
and* police surveillance had relaxed. â¢â¢\u25a0
Lew: Dock, one of the leading mem
bers of the Ping Kong tong and a
merchant of means, was just' about to
emerge from Ross alley into Jackson
street when. Louey Bing stepped from
a doorway and confronted him.' With
out a moment's hesitation Lchiev drew
a long revolver from- his loose blouse
arid commenced shooting. Two bullets
struck Dock in the breast and a third
entered .his groin. The Ping Kong
tong man staggered, fell and was dead
feefore any one could reach him. Louey
Bing cast his weapon near the body
and rushed down Jackson street. He
had. gone but a short distance when
his way was impeded by John King,
who does janitor, work in the quarter
for a real estate firm. King had wit
nessed the crime and he . f^ized"- the
murderer. Detective McMahon fol
lowed quickly and the prisoner was
hurried to the Hall of Justice.
When searched another revolver,
fully loaded, was found In the posses
sion of Bing: His face had been; whit
ened and his queue was neatly twisted
under a false wig. He was placed in
tne tanks and since his arrest' several
Chinese witnesses have identified him
as the man who -fired the shots. / -;.
MOY SHOT AS HE LAY ASLEEP.
It ..'was shortly after midnight when
five . shots were fired in the rear -of
the Song Wing Yuen.' Restaurant at
727 Dupont street. Immediately three
highblndersj.rushed from the place, en
tered a building' at 721 Dupont street,
climbed to 'the roof and from there,
made their escape into Waverly place.
When the police reached the scene Lee
Moy, proprietor of the place and mem
ber, of the Hip Sing Tong, lay on the
floor with a bullet hole through' his
head and, another through his heart.
Moy had just dozed .off in 'a " poppy

trains at Harney- last week and the* death
of Thomas F." Mason by a verdict re
turned by the Coroner's jury late 1 to

that had the last car. on the -second sec

a better extent the terrible crash and
that the loss of life would bava been

The verdict has caused much talk in

is not known. Both Detherdse and
Bridgeman have lost their positions. En

MOTIVE ' BEHIND MOVE
Juniors Instead of Seniors
Are to Be Chosen for
Golden Key Preferment
BERKELEY, Sept.^ 25.-Hopirg to in
fluc* a greater interest in pure scholar
ehlp among the students of the univers
ity, and- especially to inspire members
of the under classes wifn an ambition to
achieve distinction as brilliant and able
students such as- might entitle them to
be "chosen to membership In the Phi Beta
K.ipj.a honor society, a, radical change
In the method of choosing members in
this famous society hag just been decided
upon by the local branch of the Phi Beta
Kappa.
Professor Evan P. Lewis, president jof
the Phi Beta Kappa at the University of
California, stated to-day that the society
has decided to elect members hereafter
In their junior instead cf their senior
year. Heretofore the coveted golden keys
of the Phi Beta Kappa, signifying that
the wearers rank highest as university
EcholaiiÂ«, have be-en worn exclusively by
seniors. Not until a man or woman stu
dent entered the senior class was he con
sidered as a candidate, or a possible Phi
Beta. Kappa man.
Now and ht-rt-after the juniors will have
this dignity. The change is regarded by
come as revolutionary, especially when
ordered by bo ancient, conservative and
digr.ifitd'a society as the Phi Beta Kappa.
It is understood, that the motive' prompt
ing the change was a desire to increase
tnc interest In Phi Beta Kappa honors
among th*Â» under-class men, so that in
Â»tead of being tempted to lounge through
thilr Mm, or second or even third year,
waiting for the senior year to do real
wÂ«iÂ»k and win highest honors, they may
now be induced to begin the good work
earlier.
Although the university students have
been considerably excited over this rul
ing of the Phi Beta Kappa society here.
4 regarding: It as a rather revolutionary
proceeding, more experienced men say
thai it Is not co extiaordinary as the
younger men suppose, as Yale ha* adopt
ed ifce same procedure, supposedly for the
earn-, reasons.

"William bpruiile Discusses
Kate 31akiuÂ£ by Officials
of Government.
â¢ BERKELEY. Sept. 25. â William
Bproule. a traffic official of the Southern
P&cific Company, addressed the College
Of Commerce Club this afternoon upon
the subject of "Government Regulation
of- Freight Rates." He declared that
the Interstate Commerce Commission
if given power to revise rates as de
cired would have practical control of
the railways of the country without
responsibility for the results. He of
fered arguments to prove that natural
conditions govern the making of rates
by the railroad companies, and that
the. entire question is one that cannot
be. properly put in the hands of a body
of outside men, who propose to be
guMvd by abstractions and theories
rather than facts and actual conditions.
Mr. Sproule cited a number of in
stances where the railroad companies
protected California industries by
maintaining a rate which the Inter
state Commerce Commission would re
vise, notably in the rate on corn from
Kansas to the coast, the corn being
needed by the California milling .in
dustry. The commission ordered a re
vision, which, if maintained, would
operate injuriously against the milling
industry here. The railroads thus were
pictured as seeking to develop industry,
where theorists would interfere.
Burgiara Visit DentUta.
ALAMEDA. Sept. 25.â Burglars made
their regular semi-annual visit to a
number of local dental offices last
night and carried away a quantity of
gojd filling, gold crowns and instru
ments. The dentists who lost are: Dr.
A. L. Vancrom and Dr. Dunwoodle Mc-
Kean. whose' places of business are in
the Odd Fellows' block. Dr. Hr A.
Eft-human, a physician, who has an office
in the same building, was also a vic
tim of the burglars.
Entrance to "the offices was obtained
by forcing the doors with a jimmy.
Desks and cabinets were broken into
by the thieves in their search- for
booty. It is the theory of the police
that the work was done by amateurs
who are members of the notorious
Twenty-third avenue gang of East
Oakland, several of whom were "ob
served on Park street last night. \u25a0'.. The
thefts were the second of the kind
that have been perpetrated here within

As Long as They Are
. Satisfied, He Is,
He Declares.
Addr.esses iooo Per
sons at Berkeley
Auditorium.
BERKELEY, Sept. 25.â With oratory,
the magic of which was potent enough
to help a thousand people of Berkeley
forget the discomforts of a warm,
stuffy auditorium, William Jennings
Bryan spoke to-night at the Berkeley
theater as a lecturer under Y. M. C. A.
auspices, his subject being "The Value
of an Ideal." College, boys" swarmed
in the gallery, and Bryan smiled ex
pansively as they sang, "Here's to you,
William Bryan â Here's to you, our
jovial friend." and laughed while they
gave an "Oski Wow Wow" of univer
sity coinage.
Ideals in 'business, in matrimony, in
politics, in party, in the nation were
declared by Bryan to be essential, of
inestimable value, determining individ
ual and national character, fixing a
man's place in the world and settling
his status as a citizen with his fellows.
In this connection he discussed with
skill and eloquence an ideal govern
ment, which the speaker declared to
be a government of the people, for the
people. He said in part:
- Always the people must decide, and their
decision I cheerfully bow to, for decisions
must proceed from them and with them the
final issue always should rest.
If the people want gold and silver to use as
money, I concur; if they want a gold stand
ard, I ' am willing they should have it. and
what more should I be asked to concede In the
Interests of harmony than this? If the people
want radium for money, a^id after discovering
that there is but two pounds of it in the
world, are contented to give Rockefeller one
pound and Morgan the other, and then watch
them play with it, I am willing again to stand
with the people. If the people want' a high
tariff, very good, and if they want it higher,
and then hlsher, I say amen. \u25a0 But If they
want Â»t lower, and still lower, and lower still,
I concur, too. They have been tinkering with
it in this way for a ir'od many years, and I
think, it due to be tinkered with again very
soon. If the people want monopolies â lots of
them â all right. If they want one big monop
oly, all right again; and if they decide to put.
an end to all natural monopolies, then, all
right to that; and the sooner they btgin that
work, the better for the nation.
An ideal party, an ideal government,
Bryan, declared, could be gained only
by an appeal to the conscience, "not to
a Republican, not. to a Democratic con
science, but. to an American, a Chris
tian conscience." Bryan's peroration
was a plea for good faith in the con
duct of affairs of .the nation, as a
weapon calculated to inspire love for
the flag, and to strengthen the place
of America among, nations, as wars of
conquest could not hope to do." â¢-His*
tribute to President Roosevelt's work
in bringing about peace between Japan
and Hussla and. the accompanying de
claration that Euch an act did- more to
establish the nation as a&world power
than a generation of wars for conquest,
elicited very great applause.
A reception for Bryan was held in
the parlors and offices of the \u25a0 First
National : Bank of Berkeley before the
lecture.- In the afternoon Bryan , was
taken through Berkeley In the auto
mobile of rJ.L. Barker, and at dinner
he was the guest of President A. W.
Naylor of the First National Bank.
BRYAN TO HAVE A BUSY DAY.
I>rorraDinie Mill Keep .VebraÂ»kan Kdl-
tor on the Move.
That Editor Bryan is a stickler for
details was evidenced yesterday while
arranging for his departure to-morrow
for the Orient. In the morning the
Nebraska orator visited the Mail dock,
where he carefully counted every piece
of- his baggage that had been forward
ed to the steamer, and also made a
close scrutiny of the cabins that are to
be used by himself and family. Later
in the forenoon he had his passports
vised at the Russian Consulate and re
turning ,to the St. Francis Hotel he
wrote a number of letters.' then went
to Berkeley.
At the solicitation of Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, Bryan has arranged to go to
Berkeley at noon to-day by way of the
Key Route, and address the student
body at 1 o'clock on "Young Men and
Education." Before going to Berkeley,
where he will be the guest of Presi
dent Wheeler at luncheon, Mr. and Mrs.
Bryan and their son and daughter will
be given a ride through this city , ln
an automobile under escort of the Iro
quois Club reception committee. . Al
though Bryan has made several visits
to San Francisco he has never seen the
city and its surroundings and it is pro
posed to show him everything of in
terest this morning.
Returning from Berkeley at T 4 o'clock
this afternoon -he will hold a public
reception until 6 o'clock in the Gold
and White room of the St. Francis
Hotel. In the evening he will address
the Young Men's. Christian Association
on the "Value of ; an Idea." After the
lecture he will be received by -the
Press Club and later he will go^' to
B'nai B'rith Hall, where he is to be
formally welcomed by the Iroquois
Club members and their. friends.
Cut ArchbUUop'a Share.
OAKLAND. Sept. 25. â In the final dis
tribution of the estate of the late
Mary Canning, ordered. to-day, It was
found necessary to cut down the share
left to Archbishop Riordan from one
half to a third in order to meet the
requirements of the State constitution,
which provides that not more than a
third of an estate can be left to a
religious corporation. The remainder
of his share, ; however, was given to
George Montgomery, high in Catholic
councils, across the bay.
The will of Mrs. Canning^ provided
that half of her estate should go. to
Archbishop Riordan~ and the remainder
to Mrs. Mary Davitt, wife of the Irish
patriot of that name. It further pro
vided that If the: Archbishop .could not
receive the amount left him what' was
left over should go to-..- Montgomery.-
The property amounts to about $75,000
and is but a mere remnant of an estate
supposed to "have been worth $500,000. '
How much .W. J. Yore, the nephew
of Mrs. Canning, got in a compromise

MINE DIRECTORS
AGAIN ACCUSED
More Trouble for the Cali

Courts of Marin County
DISPUTE OVER \ STOCK
Shares Sold for Delinquent
Assessments at the Time
an Injunction Was Issued
... w /
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL, Sept. 25.â County Re
corder E.J. Connell filed a complaint in
the; Superior Court this morning, alleg
ing further irregularities in the Califor
nia Mining Company, ; and praying that
the directors be enjoined from selling the
plaintiff's Bhares of stock for delinquent
assessments.
The plaintiff holds eight hundred shares
upon which a ten cent assessment has
been levied and remains unpaid. The sale
was advertised for to-day. Judge Len
non issued an injunction reseraining the
defendant. company, its officers, directors,
agents or employes from selling or dispos
ing of . the plaintiff's shares until further
order. of the court. James W. Keys, attor
ney for Connell, handed the papers to Un
der Sheriff . Lichtenberg, insturcting him
tot go to. the mining company's office and
serve them on either Secretary James W.
Cochrane or President James H. Wil
kins. Lichtenberg was there before the
hour 7 of sale and as neither party ap
peared within . three-quarters of an hour
after the specified time he left. '
Later he met and served Secretary
Cochrane with the papers. ' Cochrane
said: "You are too late. John Cochrane
was appointed ' auctioneer by the direc
tors to dispose of \u25a0 the delinquent stock.
The stock was sold to the mining .com
pany a few minutes ago." ~
; The directors say that every step taken
in the transaction was legal and at a
special meeting this morning they ap
pointed John Cochrane auctioneer to dis
pose of the delinquent stock. The in
junction served on Secretary Cochrane
would have no effect on the transaction,
as it was' served after the sale was con
summated. Attorney .Keys takes a very
different view. He doubts the legality of
the methods of the mining company. He
will bring suit to have the sale declared
null and void. He questions the: rights
of the directors in appointing an .auc
tioneer. ' ,
Keys, in a complaint, alleges that the
minutes of July 26 of the company did not
contain any order or resolution levying
an assessment of ten cents and that sev
eral weeks after ; the secretary inserted
an extra leaf between the pages of these
minutes, containing a resolution author
izing the company to call for $8734 for the
purpose of paying off the indebtedness of
the corporation and that an assessment
of ten cents per share was then levied.
Keys asks .to have this alleged resolution
declared null and void. He further^ al
leges .that the 7. owners , of other % shares
have not paid-all of the ten assessments
levied and that the company has not ex
ercised its powers j in : collecting the same.
. Connell ' filed : a ; suit \u25a0in equity lh Augus t
against the directors of the company to
compel an accounting of all moneys.

SUING BRADLEY
FOR ACCOUNTING
Partners of Young Mining
Man Say That He Com-
mitted Breach of Trust
YAlleped breach of trust is the rather
*;r.sational feature of a suit filed yes
terday against F. W. Bradley, one of the
rcdst prominent and * wealthy of the
younger California mining men. The
plaintiff in the suit is the Oroville Gold
Dredging and Exploration Company, of
which Bradley was formerly the presi
dent. The company is one of the pioneers
In the great dredger district near Oro
vllle and has as Its stockholders some of
the leading mining men and mining con
cerns of this country. among them John
Kays Hammond, James L. Houghtellng.
Cyrus W. McCormick and E. L. Ryereon
el Chicago. E. A. Wiltsee of New York
and J. Kennedy Todd & Co. of New York.
With these men Bradley, who was, up to
& few months ago. regarded as a protege
cf John Hays Hammond, has been promi
nently associated in many mining enter
prises.
In the suit filed yesterday by Attorney
Charles S. Wheeler, with whom is asso
ciated in the case Jesse W. Lilienthal,
Bradley is accused of having willfully
\u25a0waived an option taken by the plaintiff
upon holdings in Yuba County, which, it
is alleged, would have greatly enriched
the company had they baen acquired and
developed.
SIM 3TEARL.Y A. MILLION.
As a result of the waiver it is claimed
that the Oroville Gold Dredging and Ex
ploration Company has been damaged in
the sum cf $1*20,000. The complaint sets
forth that Bradley was elected president
yt the plaintiff corporation on March 7,
'\u25a0'.I, and that on June 17 of the same year
c took an option on 1000 acres of land
in Yuba jCounty, the option being taken
in his own name, but for the benefit of
tlie company. By the terms of the option,
it is alleged, James O'Brien, owner of the
property, agreed to sell the same for
$100 an acre, payable in four installments.
" Later, it is claimed, Bradley purchased
from O'Brien the so-called "Halletf land,
paying 5^50 lor the same.
On July 21, 1301, the complainant
continues, Bradley paid O'Brien $12,500
under the option for the purchase of
the 1000 acres. Shortlj' after this, it
is alleged, work was begun on the
property and it proved to be of ex
ceptional value, a reasonable figure be
ing 11,^)00.000. While this was going
on, however, the complainant alleges
that Bradley entered into a secret and
personal agreement 'with a third party,
agreeing to- let the option of the plain
tiff corporation expire so that the lands
might be obtained by the third party
and his associates. For doing this, it
is* alleged, Bradley secured a sum
greatly In excess of $10,000.

RAISCH GIVEN
A LOOPHOLE
U. S. District Attorney Says
That Indictment Has Been
Decided to Be Invalid
The unexpected happened in the United
States District Court yesterday, when
United States Attorney Devlin called the
attention of Judge de Haven to a decision
which, if taken by the court as a prece
dent, will result in the dismissal of all the
cases of fraudulent naturalization in
which former Deputy County Clerk W. C.
Raisch and Frank Johnson have been in
dicted as the principals. Devlin cited
the case of the United States vs. York, in
volume 131, page 323, of the Federal Re
porter, wherein section 5424 of the Revised
Statutes, the section under which
Devlin procured Raisch's indictment,
is construed as applicable only to the ap
plicant for citizenship or to the witness on
behalf of such applicant, and does not af
fect any other person who may engage In
the business of forging or selling such
counterfeit certificates of citizenship. Sec
tion 5424 reads as follows:
Every pÂ«rÂ»on applying to bÂ« admitted a
citizen or appearing as a witness for , any
such person who knowingly personates any
other person than himself or falsely appears
In the name of a deceased person, or In an
assumed or fictitious name or falsely makes,
forges or counterfeits any oath, notice, affi
davit, certificate, order, record, signature |or
other inbtrument, paper or proceeding required
or authorised by law relating to or providing
for the naturalization of aliens or who utters,
sells, disposes of or uses as true or genuine
or for any unlawful purpose any false, forged,
ants-dated or counterfeit oath, - notice, certlfl
c*te. order, record, signature, Instrument, pa
per or proceeding above specified or sells or
disposes of to any person other than the per
son for whom it was originally Issued any
certificate of citizenship or certificate showing
any person to be admitted a citizen shall be
punished by imprisonment at \u25a0 hard labor not
less than one year nor more than five years,
or by a fine of not leas than $300 nor more
than $1000. or by both such fine and Im
prisonment. \u25a0 .
The decision goes on to say* "It will be
observed that after the word 'or' and be
fore the words 'who utters,' â¢ etc., are
omitted the words 'every :\u25a0 person,' .with
which the section opens. The same omis
sion occurs in, the third auxiliary clause
of the section. Hence 'who,' as so, used
and wherever used In the section, refers
to the initial 'every person.' But such
words 'every, person' are modified by the
words 'applying to be admitted a citi
zen or appearing as a witness for any
such person.' The- Indictment does not
charge that Buonoro, the principal," was
either 'a person applying to be admitted
a ! citizen, or appearing as a witness for
any such person,' and it . was', admitted
upon the argument that he was not such
person." \
The court goes on to say that section 2
of the act of 1870, of which section 5424 is
an amendment, applied the laws to all per
sons, but that in amending it "the revis
ers and Congress f * *. *\u0084 deliberate^- took
out words from the earlier act; that were
palpably necessary to cover such of
fenses."
Judge de Haven said , that ; he would look
into the matter on Saturday of this week,
when Raisch would' be' called up for ar
raignment.'' .. \u25a0â¢.\u25a0...' '\u25a0:.'\u25a0
Assistant United States -Attorney George
Clark was asked whether Raisch and the
others would be allowed to go scot free
Bhould ' Judge de Haven V follow, the de
cision in . the United States \ vs. 3 York as
'a : precedent.' Mr.^Clark replied:: ; .
"No, elr. ; They will! be prosecuted under
another section;\which will hold good." \

HEN TURKEYS ELOPE
WITH PARK PEACOCKS
Rooker's Fowls Leave With
Feathered Mashers, Caus
ing a Scandal. -
Despite the fact that they had been
carefully reared and watch-ed, four
black hen turkeys belonging to Elmer
Rooker, of 429 Ninth , avenue, eloped
Saturday afternoon with two peacocks
from Golden Gate Park. When they
were first missed Rooker refused to
believe that they had gone back on
their bringing up. He thought they
had been forcibly abducted by some
hungry person, and reported-the loss
to the Park Police Station.
Policeman Pidgeon was detailed to
hunt up the missing fowls; He found
them in Golden Gate Park in the
company of' the two sporty pea
cocks, arrayed In their, gaudiest ap
parel. Pidgeon gave chase,, but the
elopers and their escorts eluded j him.
When last seen they were headed for
Strawberry Hill. .
This elopment presents a serious
problem to chicken raisers in the Rich
mond District and; residents south of
the. park. Poultrymen out that way
are wondering how further scandals of
this sort may be prevented. There is
talk of petitioning the superintendent
of the park to keep hfs peacocks in
an inclosure to prevent them from
using their blandishments upon indus
trious and respectably brbught up
barnyard fowls. - Meanwhile turkey
owners. are on the alert to prevent the
breaking up of other happy barnyards.
Rooker has purchased a shotgun, and
any more feathered mashers that
wander near - hia . barnyard will get
theirs. . â¢/- '-: \' \u25a0. '. .^'-' .

PUPILS' LIVES

Safety of Children at Cleun
ent School Is Menaced
Through Lack of Exits
The Clement Grammar School build
ing is in .such a deplorable condition
that the residents of the district are
getting up a petition requesting; the
Board of- Supervisors to make neces
sary improvements to insure safety to
the hundreds of children who- attend
the^ school. â¢ . ;.,.-..
-The Clement' schoolhouse is a veri
table nre trap and" in * case of con
flagration a ' calamity could not be
averted. The building, which is sit
uated on the south side of Geary
street, a few doors above Jones, is sur
rounded by tenement houses. Should
a tire , ever ; start, the exits from - the
school building would be inadequate to
allow the children to get into the
street in time to save their lives.
There are 800 children who- attend
the school and the 'parents have come
to realize the danger. Many, fathers
and mothers who have visited the
school have noticed how the building
is hemmed in by surrounding struc
tures and they are determined to se
cure better protection for their ohil
dren. - â¢ ;: . .'
The parents have, also noticed the
poor 'atmospheric oondltiona. that.Bur
round the youths.. during their hours
of study. In hot weather, the odor l of
cooking, from a'. .'three-story-'.' tenement
house which adjoins the school makes
It necessary to keep the [ windows
closed/' T* -."'-.'â¢-:* . ">. \u25a0 .'
, In . the rear of the. big structure are
two beginners' classes. These children
are - compelled to. walk, through : :the
yard and, then through the main school
to get into the street. ., There is one
exit j from the. school : yards 'through
the main building. This is a door
through the east end of the building.
It most resembles a back entrance to
a. stage,' having : an opening which
would not allow more than two pupils
out.; at a time. As the school yards
are below the level of Geary street, lt
Is necessary, for the .youths to climb
several stairs before " coming to - the

TELLS OF.. "MURDER" FROM *
. Â» iÂ£i OLLIE TOBIN'S APARTMENTS
Mm; George F. Wells Assure* Police
man Who Responds That There
la "Nothing Wrong.'*.
. The spectacle of a disrobed man
yelling '.'Murder, murder; help, police,"
early yesterday morning from the win
dows of the Goldaracena, an apart
ment-house on the northwest'eorner of
Sutter and Larkln streets, aroused the
neighborhood and brought' several po
licemen to the scene of supposed car
nage. The strange sounds came from
the apartment of Oliver Tobin on the
top floor. "When Policeman Jenkins ar
rived .in -the rooms, consternatit^j
reigned. Jenkins was met at the door
by Mrs. George F. Wells, who excited
ly. Informed him. that, there was noth
ing wrong, but . that Mrs, Tobin. was
seriously 111. Tobin. could not be seen
and another, man, who^left.his hat be
hind, was nowhere to be found. ,
Those in j the rooms of Tbbln at the
time of the affair were Tobin and wife
and Mrs. Wells and a man whose name
could not be learned. The evening was
spent .by the four, in, a. Mason-street
resort. Shortly after their arrival at
home the "rough house? was started.
Numerous bottles about the apartment
gave evidence of a glorious time. .Why
Mrs. Tobin .was sick or, who the un-^
known man was who yelled ; the blood
curdling words from -Tobin's apartment'
is not known. A roomer in the house
heard loud and angry words from* To
bin's apartment, then a crash and the
words of terror that startled'even a
policeman- standing on the . sidewalk
beneath. Dr. Poheim was hastily sent
for to attend the "sick" lady and at the
mention, of the Police Commissioner's
name a- magic spell came o'er the po
licemen in the house and the impromp
tu investigation that was under way
hastily ended.

TUESDAY* ......... '. .' .SEPTEMBER 26.; "1903
THE SPEECH OF MR. PARTRIDGE
THE candidate for Mayor needs no further introduction to the
people than the speech in which he accepted the Republican
nomination, li is the utterance of a man of clean and high
purpose and with the iron determination to pursue it., regardless of
consequences personal to himself. He placed, himself at once in
the company of the men to whom mere partisanship is secondary
to the purity of the government, and the interest of all of the people.
His spirit is* that of Roosevelt; Folk and Weaver. His place is witn
the men in this city who have given time and toil to the organiza
tion of a movement that will bring all of our citizens who want
decent and reputable municipal government to join hands and bal
lots to get what they want.
The government of San Francisco is now thoroughly demor
alized.' Four years of grafting at every contact between official
authority and private right lias practically suspended the law. The
police force has been taught by experience to withhold protection
from such citizens and such interests as the administration desires
to punish, to discipline or to blackmail. The individual members
of the force have learned that when they have a choice between
doing their duty and neglecting it in the interest of the grafting
policy of their superiors, they must leave their duty undone. li
they do noi, they know the sinuous ways by which they will be.
jputjon the carpet and degraded or broken. The esprit de corps of
the force has been broken. Pride in the star and uniform has dis
appeared and the police establishment exists merely to do the will
of the boss. This was shown by its flagrant offense in forcing the
gallery doors of the Alhambra Theater to admit a mob for the.
purpose of howling down the Republican convention.
When the police refuse or neglect to protect a citizen* on the
street from the mobilized disorder set going by the Mayor himself,
we may soon expect that the other public agencies of the city
will be subjected to the same sort of control, and the property of
a citizen who is personally offensive, to the boss will be permitted
to burn, and the health of such offenders will be jeopardized by
the indifference of another agency of the administration. Govern
ment is regulated by law. It has no other purpose than the en
forcement of the law for the equal benefit and protection of all.
But we have no such government here. Public authority is used
for personal ends and profit. It is used to blackmail a boss into
private enterprises on the ground floor. It is used to wink at vices
that will pay toil for immunity and to oppress legitimate enterprise
and business that will not buy the rights that belong to them
under the law.
To correct this foul condition of the government is the task
that Mr. Partridge accepts as a hard duty, from which he will not
lh'nch. The declaration of his purpose is sincere. He does- not
mince words nor sacrifice the truth for fear of offending the forces
that have put an evil shadow upon San Francisco. He makes a
clear-cut issue, which is projected into the platform 911 which he
stands. There is one issue only â reform in the city government.
An organ of the municipal administration was amusing in its
outcry when a hypocritical resolution indorsing the Republican na
tional and State administrations was referred to the committee, of
the convention. The organ lamented daily this "treachery" to
President Roosevelt and Governor .Pardee. ThfiHune of the organ
was merely amusing. Does any one doubt that if President Roose
velt and Governor Pardee were voters in this city they would vote
for Mr. Partridge? Does any one doubt that -if Weaver, Folk and-
Jerome were our fellow-citizens they would be found supporting
Mr. Partridge? In national politics they differ, but they are not to
be deceived. Neither protection nor free trade, differential tariff
nor reciprocity, rebates nor control of insurance, is at stake in this
city election. Decency is the only issue, and they are for decency
and honor against indecency and dishonor. .\u25a0 ;
The issue is -joined. On one side'is; Mr. Partridge declaring
that the ten commandments are good .politics -for Sin .-Francisco.
On the other side is the boss and the system with a new decalogue

SAWDUST ALCOHOL.
THE problem in milling timber is what to do \vith""the saw
.dust, . WhÂ«i) the lumber mills are on streams the discharge of
sawdust into the water kills the fish, and the law attempts to
â¢prevent thiÂ«. Germany gives more attention than any other country
" td the production of alcohol and to its economic uses for fuel and in
the arts. German potato alcoholis sold largely in the Orient. Not
..content with the use of that vegelable as its main resource for
alcohol, Germany is now making it of sawdust./ .
* The London Times minutely describes the process used by
Professor Classen of Aix-la-Chapelle. By the use of gaseous sul
phurous acid' and digestion under pressure the cellulose in the saw
dust is .converted into sugar, of which a long ton of dust yields'
about 500 pounds. This material is then treated with a ferment
and is distilled in quite the ordinary way used; in producing alcohol
from a grain mash. A ton of sawdust gives fifty .gallons of
* crude alcohol. The. manufacture is found to be profitable, as the
1 sawdust is a waste product. It is not stated whether the result
resembles the wood alcohol of commerce, unfavorably kno\vn for
its fatal effect on careless people who use it as an intoxicant. The
presumption, however, is that it is unlike that product of the-de
structive distillation of wood. The sawdust . alcohol is applied in
the srts and. enters into the manufacture of .explosives,.*b'eing an in
gredient in smokeless powder.. The process is. not complicated and
seems inexpensive. ; .. â¢ \u25a0'.\u25a0-'., '\u25a0 v ? vt.
\ We are making alcohol in this country from grain and, from
the waste of beet-sugar mills. A French company has for some
time operated in California on beet-sugar waste. TUe lumber mills
t\{ this coast produce immense quantitiesof sawdust Some of it. is
used for fuelunder the steam boilers of the mills, but this is mainly
for the purpose of getting it out of the way. If each^ton can be
made to yield fifty gallons of crude or twenty-five gallons of abso
iSate alcohol its utilization for that purpose may interest the owners'
of lumber milis. .-.-..

PEOPLE IN EYE
OF THE PUBLIC
DR. ADOLF FRITZEN. Bishop of
Strasburg, has again issued an
edict forbidding priests within
his. diocese to use bicycles. He
is sharply criticized therefor by the
newspapers, which call attention to the
fact that bicycling ceased long ago to
be a mere secular sport and that
priests often find the wheel most use
ful, especially those who have to visit
members of their congregation in re
mote country places.
Dr. W. H. Wishard of Indianapolis is
probably the oldest practicing physi
cian in Indiana. He was born January
1", 1816, and is therefore nearly 90
years old. Although he is not exerting
himself to build up a practice, he still
answers calls and puts in his spare
time going over his old accounts and
making out unpaid bills.. He is one of
the two surviving charter members of
the Indiana State Medical Society, the
other one being Dr. P. H. Jameson of
Indianapolis, who is about eight years
younger. than Dr. Wishard.

THE accompanying illustrations show
the effect had on an Indiana man of
moderate education in attempting to
pronounce the various localities j and per
sons mentioned In connection with three
of the latest wars. \ It will be observed
that before the breaking out of the Span
ish-American difficulty his features were
regular and not altogether void of beau
ty, says the Chicago Ghronicle. He took
a deep interest in this contest, and, as he
was the center of the conversational ses
sions which were held each evening, at
the corner grocery^ he took particular
pains to keep himself well informed con
cerning all the details of that brief con
flict. He unfamiliar with the Spanish
language, the only words of that tongue
he ever had seen being the names on the
boxes of alleged Havana cigars. He went
at his task studiously and in endeavoring
to master the correct pronunciation of the
localities given In the war dispatches he
wrenched several muscles of his face, and
after the close of the conflict his persist
ent .attempts to get at ' the real . Spanish
articulation left. his face in the condition
above represented. He felt, however, that
he had done a/commendable service and
bore his disfiguration with fortitude. - .
MORE TROUBLE FOR HIM. - -
While doing his best to get his face
back to normal .outline the English-Boer
unpleasantness broke out. Again he was
actuated by a similar impulse to keep in
touch with the progress of that\bloody
contest, and 'carefully digested all the
events in connection with it so that he
might impart his. knowledge to the corner
grocery committee at. its evening meet
ings. He found his task, however/consid
erably more difficult than it was when the
Spanish-American war was in progress,
and the facial contortions required in an
effort to pronounce the variously men
tioned Transvaal localities emphasized
the old distortions. . He kept to his task
heroically and was frequently highly
complimented by his hearers for the ap
parent vastness of his knowledge concern
ing the bitter and bloody contest. While
he realized that his face was" undergoing
numerous changes, he lost none of his old
enthusiasm in playing, the part of in
structor to hls v admiring neighbors and
associates. One very close friend ap
pealed to him to give less attention to his
work of education, as he had followed
with more or less solicitude the strange
disfiguration of his friend's features. It
had no effect, however, and he continued
his services to the little community with
unflagging interest ' until peace ' was de
clared. The cost had been very great, but
he drew consolation from â¢ the fact that
he had performed a commendable work.
The world was now at' peace and the
enthusiastic educator began to 'pay atten
tion to a readjustment of his facial out
line. A number of ' specialists were.con
sulted and .while -they dtd not encourage
him in the belief of complete restoration
they did hold out hope of improvement.
It was^ while the doctors were giving
clcse attention to this most peculiar case
that there came mutterings from the Fax-
East that had jj the sound of war. Russia
and . Japan were in Â»a fierce controversy
over the future ' control -'of the seacoast
line between Port Arthur' and- Vladivo
stok arid all the indications pointed to
ward a res6rt to arms/* Finally the crash
came and the newspapers overflowed with
accounts of the initial conflicts. There

their commanders, while on i the other

KISSING UNKNOWN
IN MANY LANDS
A CARESS, a kiss, a kindly touch
are supposed to be signs of love
everywhere, while a frown ex-
presses displeasure. A study of
the psychology of people shows that
the kiss is only one expression of affec
tion^ There are places where kissing is
unknown, this mode of expression be
ing supplemented by caressing with
the hand, the nose, the tongue, clapping
of hands and various embraces.
Western civilization holds the kiss as
the kindest expression of endearment.
Paolo Mantegasza, " the great Italian
psychologist, says: "Fear, religion, in
terest, space and time may separate
lovers, but the kiss they have ex
changed will hold them together." For
all this Darwin assures us that kissing
is unknown among the Malays, the
dwellers of the Friendly Isles, the An
damans, Fuegians, the Tahitians, Papu
ans, Australians and the Somalis of
Africa. - \u25a0 ...--.,.
The Malays express* their_ feeling of
endearment by touching noses. They
say much tenderness is \u25a0 expressed by
bringing the noses in contact. They
believe it is by the nose we breathe,
and the bringing of noses in contact
has the same influence; on the soul. A
traveler told them to kiss with their
lips, but they said: "No, no, the soul is
notjn themout'h." .
The Andaman Islanders also refuse to
hear of the joys of kissing. They rub
noses occasionally, but it is customary
for f riends^to greet each other with .the
eye. When a husband is away Â«and re
turns home, he shows his joy by sitting
with his arms about his wife's neck,
and they weep and howl as if a great
sorrow had befallen them. Suddenly, by
some unexplainable reason," this grief
turns to joy. The man then calls on his
other relatives and goes through a sim
ilar performance. '
African husbands never kiss their
wives. They would consider -this a too
familiar' expression of "devotion. A
Mandigo wife meeting her husband who
has just returned home, throws herself
on the ground as a token of greeting.
In Loan go the women kneel, and as
they rise they clap their hands.
The Dahomeyans greet their hus
bands with wonderful "dignity; they
prostrate themselves, throw sand on
their heads and never think of rising
until their husbands make the com
mand. The Tongans are more strenu
ous in their, expression; they tear their
hair and even beat their breasts.
But the New Zealandersprefer to be
lieve that the soul has its nearest ap
proach* to "another soul through the
nose. After a long absence the husband
gives vent to his joy in the tangi â a
bitter crying and moaning spell which
transforms Itself gradually into a mer
ry laugh. In Polynesia when a husband
becomes demonstrative he strokes his
wife's face with his hand or foot. The
Australian holds his wife -by the neck
and pats her on the back.
\u25a0-UNAVOIDABLE.
That the geographical area of the
United States is not fully comprehended
by the average foreigner is illustrated
by an anecdote told by Jefferson de
Angelis, the comedian who is starring
in "Fantanal". An Englishman, accom
panied by his valet, had been traveling
due west from New York for four days.
At the. end oi. the fourth day master
and servant seated ' themselves in the
smoker, of the train,, whence, the man
looked steadily out of the car window.
At last his companion grew curious.
"John," he said, "of what are *you
thinking?".:

FOR THE RELIEF OF POETS.
THE man with the massive, dome

recognized that- he had something else
on- his mind.);*' ... .': \u25a0 : ' â¢
'"Patent what?" the ;man with the
trowel-shaped forehead inquired.
"Why, a little scheme that I have in
vented . for the relief of distressed
young poets and suffering: rhymesters."
k \u0084"How you going: to it?"
â¢ "Easy enough. . You've noticed,
haven't you, that all young poets write
on one of three subjectsâ -love, one of
the seasons, or 'My Dreams?" Well,
I have invented what I call ray Inter
changeable," intermixablei - triple-elastic
system of versification" for soothing and
relieving perplexed and pained B young
poets. There are five verses, which
are enough for all ordinary purposes,
but* the first' verse alone" will be suf
ficient |to give you the idea. . It runs
this way: . ./-..
Ode to ("Love,) ("My Dream") (any
v old season).. .-< ',
"... \..b. ......'.., dove
...:...'.. hush
............................ .... love
\u0084 .: . gush

;...... / toll
TV ; still.
"There! What do you think of
that?" .
"Blowed-if I see how It's going to
help the distressed young poet any."
"Don't, hey? Well, that's because
you have one of these cheap, common
place minds that are not calculated to
see anything more lofty or soul-edify
ing than a dollar. Fortunately I have
prepared an illustration for just such
people as you. In what I am about
to show you remember that the first
lines constitute an ode to love, the sec
ond to autumn (as the autumn crop of
poems now is being reaped), and the
third alternate lines an ode to 'My
Dream.' Now look "at. this."
The man with â¢ the trowel-shaped
forehead looked and here is what he
saw:
Ode to (Love) (Autumn) (My Dream).

"How's that?" .the man with f the
dome-shaped brow inquired.
"Middling bum," the other man re
plied.
. "That's your misguided intellect
again. If you want an ode to nature
in general, as young poets frequently
do, you merely take all except the
final words, mix them in a bag, draw
them out and use them as they come."
"Your invention may be all right for
the young poet's rhyme," said the man
with the trowel-shaped forehead, "but
I don't see how it would be worth a
whoop for his rhythm."
"Rhythm!" the other responded
with indications of disgust. ."I thought
you were up to date. Haven't Walt
Whitman and several others demon
strated that rhythm is of absolutely
no importance? No, I've got the
peacherino for young and perspiring
poets. Do you" suppose I can have it
patented?" . ...
But the other man did not know.
FABLE OF THE TWO MEN.
Two men stood before the arbiter.
"What troubles you?" the latter in
quired, for it was evident that the men
were worried about something.
"We do not know whether to carry
this ton of ostrich feathers or this ton
of gold," the men replied. "/-:Â»\u25a0â¢'
"But why carry a ton of either?" was
the reply; "why not take a less
amount?" vv./V;
"Oh, we want all,", was the response.
â "Well, take your choice, the arbiter
said. .'i":']
So one of the men took the ton of
gold, and was crushed by it. And the
other took the, ton of feathers, and was
smothered by them.
"I knew it," said the arbiter, "but
they would have their way."
Moral: It is better to -be content
with a reasonable amount of the things
of life, for it is as deplorable for the
soul to be smothered* by pleasure as to
be crushed -by \u25a0; care.
"Hi got converted, an' then he back

MAKES "SUNDAY" SUCCEED
Columbia Presents
Play of Life in
the West
Bernard Popular in
His Way at the
Majestic.
â¢ Sunday," which Miss Ethel Barry
moÃ brought to the Columbia last
niglit, is not ihe great play of the
West, but an engaging; romance with a
!hie ornamental Western atmosphere
that presented to a. Barrymore constit
uency its lovely idol in most attractive
Jight, kept a large audience thoroughly
<mertai:ied, and wual would you have
more?
â¢\u25a0Si/nday" was made in England and
bears the mark of it. It was made
by v. quartet of Englishmen who be
mie themselvc^ "Thomas Uaceward."
I'WO of its four acts are laid in Silver
Creek, L. S. A., and two in Brinthorpe
Abbey. England. Curiously the "West
â¢ \u25a0i:i Bce&es are more convincing and
immensely more interesting than the
acts that ure laid in England. One
understands that some of the Raceward
corporation lias been West, and the
Western side of "Sunday" is good
enough, with all its somewhat clipped
â¢uiid shaven feel, ro to believe.
. Sunday is a young girl who has been
left when a baby by her dying father
in charge of lour minors. Grown up, and
on the eve of entering a convent to "fin
ish.** the lirst. act finds her.
ExceiU-jilly drawn and excellently acted
are tlu> four miners. Lively, the old man,
eapiially handled by William Sampson;
Tow-tor, a rough diamond, most convinc
ingly presented by Joseph Brennan; so
Davy, by Harrison Armstrong; and
Javky. the young member of the quartet,
is h vivid and handsomely picturesque
ligure as "Jack" Barrymore sees him.
(Here is another Barrymore fated to
early starhood. or one is much mis
raken.)
On a turn of the cards, in which Provi
dence in the shape of the nun rather com
icaily takes a haud. it is det-ided that
Sunday shall go to the convent. Comes
then the villain, a wicked but distinctly
awkward villain. Arthur Briuthjrpe,
\u25a0who proposes that Sunday shall so to
England with him "without benefit- of
â¢ leriry." Sh<Â» believes at first that he
tneana to marry her. and. dazzled by his
firews, manners, discourse, has consented.
But, as his meaning dawns upon her, Sun
day picks up his revolver; but Brin
tliorre is too quick for her. He clasps her
in his aims, trying to kiss herâ enter
3arky and his gun. Exit Brinthorpe
"with a bullet through him.
With her English aunt at Brinthorpe
Abbey, the home of the brother of the
fclack sheep Brinthorpe, one next finds
Sunday. She has kept the secret of Brin
thorpe 1 * death. She has fallen in love
with Brinthoipe's brother, he with her.
She hits consented to marry him. But at
last, conscience-stricken, she refuses and
goes back to Silver Creek. How it all
ccmea right in the end the Columbia will
doubtless be crowded this week to see.
For the Sunday is Ethel Barrymore, of
the elusive, insistent, penetrant charm
that makes everything this young woman
dofÂ« of such eurtous consequence. It
cannot be paid that Miss Barrymore is
Western. Yet there is a delicate direct
ness, breeziness, heartiness, in her Sun
day that suggests charmingly a West of
another and better world. Of firmer fiber
than any of Miss Barrymore's earlier
work is her powerful iittle scene with
Brinthorpe. where she shows an emotion
al intensity of a kinU that one has hardly
looked lor from this gifted young woman.
And one gets all of the fragrant, inge
nuous girlishnpss that is so characteristic
o! iliss Barryrjcre, and altogether in her
Sunday a lovely and appealing portrait
that shows a distinct advance on any
thing tha; the has yet done.
Bruce McÃae as the lover is Inanly and
engagingly Irish as ever, and Charles
iiarbury is another capital figure as Tom
ox lay. "Sunday, " for the people that are
xn it, arm be seen. For at least two acts
it is well worth seeing for itself.

a lady from Pittsburg. One of the best
bits of character work seen in some
time at the Alcazar was that of an
old peasant, played by Walter Belasco,
who earned continued applause at the
end of his scene. Adele Belgarde was
at home as Kathrin yon Bensberg, who
aids her niece in. her love with Walde

Harry McAuliffe. Harry yon Meter and
Ruth Allen. The play has much that

situations. The marriage scene lv the

will no doubt attract half the feminine
population to witness its denouement.
Hajeatft'.
About all the retail grocers of San
Francisco and their wives and sweet
hearts were at the Majestic Theater
last evening to welcome Barney Ber
nard in "His Honor the Mayor." It was
the annual theater party^ and benefit
of the Retail Grocers' Association.
Mayor Schmitz and party occupied one
box and Mr. Partridge, the candidate
of reform coalition for Mayor of San
tfTancisco, occupied the opposite box
with friends. They both laughed mer
rily at the funmaking of Bernard,
which was good all the way. There
was an abundance of joshes about the
individual members of the Retail Gro
cers' Association. Bernard sang a song
of numerous verses, two of which were
as follows:
"Oh the boss of a Frisco grocery
He don't cell willow leaves for tine tea,
His butter's, not strong.
It's as irweet as this song,
In the sugar no sand you can see.
"He ne'er sends a customer away,
Which means that they often don't pay,
And he gives trading stamps
While the tears dim his .lamps
As the profits go flitting away."
H. >. . Burmeieter,- F. B. Connolly, G.
H. Doyle, 1L Wreden and J. J. Cusack
were a theater committee that ar
ranged the event for the grocers and
were all "joshed" from the stage, while
all the other grocers laughed and ap
plauded.
Bernard has a winner in "His Honor
the Mayor." He had good support on
the part of Klmer Booth as G. Wash
ington Jaggs, a political- boss; Frank
Mac Vicars. Lloyd Ingraham. Lillian
O'Neil. Irene Outrim and a bunch of
others. No play has taken better in
San Francisco in many a day. To see
it is to laugh.
Central.
The bis scenic production of the
sensational melodrama, "Escaped from
the Harem," witnessed by a large au
dience at the Central Theater last even-
Ing, furnished an exciting evening"s
amusement to the patrons of the house.
â¢Escaped from the Harem" is thrilling
from beginning to end and one loses
one's self in following the exciting sit
uations. In fact, the author of the
tnrlodrama plays upon every human
emotion and casts all dramatic tradi
tions to the winds.
The story of the abduction of a
young American girl and her subse
quent imprisonment In an Indian harem
and her final rescue by her own de
voted lover gives every opportunity
for Bplendld scenic display and scenes
which art dear to the hearts of lovers
of melodrama. * \u25a0 '

coursed delightful music and Dan Re
claw, a comedy bicyclist, created a gale
of laughter with his amusing wheeling.
Barnoldo's dogs, cats and. monkeys, a
veritable circus in vaudeville, repeated
their success of last weekand Joseph"
Dreano, a clever monoicgist; ' L#onn
Clifton, a singer of illustrated ballads,

modern and Interesting moving pic
tares, completed an excellent pro

surprises for Thursday night and there
will be a cake walk at the Chutes on
Saturday evening after the regular
performance.

The Merrymakers Extravaganza.
Company, \u25a0which commenced a week of

company is extravagantly rich in cos
tumes and. in comfortable circum
stances as far as music is concerned.
The feminine contingent Is -large and
sporadically beautiful. Three of the
young men play well on cornet and
trombone. One of the latter plays two
cornets simultaneously. /A pair .' of

and were well received at. last night's
performance. /There is nothing;to the

\u25a0THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, -TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER ,2(3, 1905.
YOUNG SHAW IS DEAF
TO MOTHER'S PLEADING
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Sept. 25.â A mother's love
for her son induced Mrs. Leslie M. Shaw,
wife of the* Secretary of the Treasury,
to journey from her home in lowa to
Seattle in fen effort to Induce Earl, her
24-year-old boy, to leave his position as a
laborer at the Broad .street dock and re
turn to Washington, where he may live
as is befitting his father's position. Mrs.
Shaw arrived here to-night, accompanied
by her* daughter, and was met at the
depot by Earl in response to a message
from the Secretary. While he was glad to
see his mother, he will not return with
her. In fact, it is said one of the attrac
tions in Seattle is the pretty cigar stand
girl at the Rainier Grand.
Earl, who has been wayward and fond
of the world, is said to have caused* his
parents much worry. A year ago he
came West and went to Alaska. Unable
to find work, he engaged as a roustabout
on a fishing schooner In the north and
afterward became a â¢waller on one of the
boats. He returned here two weeks ago
and has been having a good time. He
has been industrious, and when the ship
he worked on as a waiter arrived here
young: Shaw was the only member of the
crew retained on its payroll. He was
given a job checking fish In and out or
the warehouse and spends eight hours
each day on the dock.. .
His mother's pleading to return home
?ither to Dcs Moines or Washington will
avail nothing, the boy says, as he likes
the West, and can make money enough
here to have fun on, and that is all he
wants.

GANGSTEBS USE MACHINES
TO DO DIRTY WORK
TEA GH VOTING OF ONE TICKET
Another, underhanded : move, of Boss
Abraham Ruef, involving- his lieuten
ants on ' the Board of Election Commis
sioners and their obedient little mes
senger, the Registrar, "has been ex
posed by the discovery that wherever
there; is a Schmitz \ campaign club of
any magnitude there is ..also a voting
machine for the instruction of voters.
In 'every, place where the machine is
set up for Instruction there are> flaring
placards bearing the name of the pres
ent Mayor. - small Schmitz political
cards placed , over the printed names
of the candidates on the other tickets,
and men wearing 1 the'Schmitz red but
ton are . ever ready to' explain to, the
visitor, be he Republican, Democrat,
Socialist br^Union Labor man, just how
to cast a straight vote for the Ruef-
Schmitz ticket, .-ir '\u25a0\u25a0'' " .-'. ,. ..,-''
In conducting: the investigation as to
the placing' of the machines The Call
has discovered that Registrar Adams
is either an incompetent or "has no re
gard for truth. According to the state
ment of the Registrar' there are voting
machines placed throughout the city,
but, he represents, he does not know
where they are placed, how long they
will remain beyond his control or. what
care is being taken of them to prevent
malicious tampering or. destruction.
The Registrar should know that
there are twenty-four machines already
placed, with the majority in the
Schmitz districts. Nineteen machines
ara in the various Schmitz dives and
strongholds throughout the city.-
CITY'S , FROrttrtTV JEOPARDIZED.
According to the purchase price for
each machine there is $18,200 worth of
valuable city property exposed to de
struction by the carelessness and
neglect of the Registrar's office and the
Board of Election Commissioners. The
mismanagement and lack of system of
Registrar Adams' office- is . well known
throughout the City Hall.
In addition to the machines that are
being placed in the many headquarters
of the various unions and in the care
of the Schmltz clubs by Deputy Regis
trar Knight, there are also small
dummy boards that have been left in
the various saloons south of Market
street by Election \ Board employes,
with instructions to each bartender
how to vote the Ruef-Schmitz ticket
only and in turn this instruction in
voting is given with every drink.
Of the fact that ,the- various labor
headquarters are using instruction-ma
chines for the education of . Its -voters
The Call makes, no. complaint. It
deplores, however, the letting of ma
chines by the Election Commissioners
to the irresponsible ! and perverted
Schmitz clubs, thereby placing in
danger much valuable city property.
Another thing that shows the purely
political bias of the board is its delay
in sending a machine to the headquar
ters of the Republican League, whose
application for one was made over two
weeks ago.
Th* plan of placing a machine in each
police station an- showing the rank and
file how to operate the machines so that
they in turn could instruct voters was
abandoned when it was found that more
anti-Schmttz men would care to visit the
police stations than Ruef gangsters.
GIVISS LITTLE INFORMATION.
It must not be imagined that .. all the
machines sent out by the Election Board
are sent' "south of tne slot.". The Thirty
secomi and Thirty-ninth districts are
well taken care of and even the "Forty
aecond comes in for a maehlrte.
The machine in the Forty-second is set
up at 104 a Larkin street, . near Sutter, in
a place that will in all probability be se
lected by the Commissioners as a polling
place. The entrance to the place is near
enough to the side entrance Â«of a saloon
to make it a convenient place for barroom
loungers. *
On the walls are hung flaming placards
bearing the ltkeness of Schmitz ana on
the curtains of ..the machines are placed
SchmlU buttons, while the man who is
supposed to impartially instruct the .vo
ter* wears a like emblem. The greatest
olitrage, however, is the placing of
Schmitz cards over the names of the can
didates on the other tickets.,.
No explanation is vouchsafed as to
voting any but a straight . Ruef-Schmitz
ticket and it was not until repeated,ques
tions were asked that the man in charge
of the machine gave information concern
ing the way to vote a split ticket.
In ...is particular district the care of
the machine devolves . on " the Schmitz
Club. The club has guaranteed to keep
the place open day. and night and have
a man in .charge to explain the mode
of operating the machine. In considera
tion of this the Election Commission has
agreed to let it have the sole use of the
machine. .'. \u25a0 . , . .
INSTRUCTING THE STUFFERS.
f In the Thirty-ninth District, where
the stuff ers -had >their short and pros
perous reign before coming to grief
through the efforts of the Grand Jury,
there is* a machine in the office of Ed
Rooker, at 343 Clement street.
was formerly on the police force of San
Francisco, but, being found, guilty of
questionable conduct, it required the
efforts of Maestretti to save, him from
dismiEsal and enable hftn. to resign. The
voters visiting the machine in that dis
trict are carefully instructed .to . vote
the Schmitz ticket. The district has
another machine at Ninth and I streets.
In the Forty-nrst, at 1838 Union
street; a like condition exists, where a

Ruef precincts of ' the districts. .The
addresses are 'B37 and 1304 % Valencia,

The. Fortieth-is fortunate in having a
machine location ; comparatively free
from Ruef's hired instructors, at 1545
Devisadero street: The Forty-third is
also fortunate in this respect, having
one at 643 Post street, but the Forty
fourth, Ruef's big stronghold, has a
machine in the divo of J. B. Vignau, at
815 Pacific street. The Forty-fifth's
one machine is also in a place of
Schmitz repute.r^at 813 Montgomery
avenue.
While. the Registrar fails to have aliy
idea, as to where the \u0084 machines, are
placed, he maintains that" they may be
removed at any time to. other places in
the districts where the' needs of the
Schmitz voters may require, them. As
for the placing of the small- dummy
boards, these seem to haVe disappeared
entirely. It Is said that they are being
passed from saloon to saloon, so that
the customers of each dive may be in
structed "properly."" In the meantime
requests from the Republican clubs
throughout tne city for either the ma
chineg or the boards are being met
with evasions and procrastination.

Commission Discusses the
Plans for Championship
of the Baseball World
DATES XOT YET FIXED
Participants Must Have
Been Signed by August 31.
Umpires to Receive $44)0
CINCINNATI, Sept. 25.â President
August Herrman and Secretary John E.
Bruce werÂ«- re-elected to-day by the
National Baseball Commission, which
then proceeded to the formulation of
rules for the .series of games for the
world's championship between the
champions of the National and Ameri
can Leagues. No schedule of the
world's championship games will be
announced until the season ia finished.
For the same reason the umpires will
not be made known at present.
After reaffirming the rules adopted
' for the games by the two leagues last
fall, the commission adopted a number
of supplementary rules, among which
are those requiring that all players
eligible to take part in the games must
have been under contract not later
than Augrust'3l; the posting of a forfeit
of JlO.OOO by the owners of the partici
pating clubs for a faithful carrying out
of the rules and provisions of the
eeries, and the fixing of the salaries
of the umpires at $401) each for the
scries. It also was decided that the
world's championship pennant should
be raised in the presence of the Na
tional Commission on a date to be
agreed on. this to bÂ« after the opening
ofthe championship season of 1906.
In the matter of field rules it was
decided that no spectators should be
allowed nearer than 235 feet from the
home base in right and left fields, or
275 feet in center field at these games,
nor within less than 25 feet of the
'foul lines on any portion of the field.
The National Commission also made
public a new rule regarding waiving
-claim of players. It provides no waiver
shall be asked by a major league club
of a player . purchased from a
minor league previous to Feb
ruary 1. After that the . presi
dent of the major league contain
ing such club must immediately notify
the president of the other major league,
who shall have twenty-four hours in
which to file claim if desired for a
club of his league. The rule is to avoid
conflict and confusion regarding
waivers.

"PACKERS FIX EATES,"
SAYS KAILEOAD MAN
President of Chicago Road
Gives Evidence Before
Interstate Commission.
CHICAGO, Sept 25. â "The packers fix
the rates," declared A. B. Stickney.
president of. the Chicago Great "Western
Railway, testifying for the defense be
fore the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion; to-day regarding freight rates on
live stock and live stock products from
the Missouri river to Chicago. In
answer to a ' question as to how- the
charges were made, President Stickney
replied: ?;: -\':' fi.
"In fixing the . rate on dressed -meat
we don't have' very much to say.' The
packer generally ' makes the rate. He
comes to "you and always makes. you feel
that he Is your friend. Then he asks you
how much you charge for certain ship
ments of dressed meats. The published
tariff is 23_cents a hundred, but he will
not pay that. You say to him: 'I will
carry, your meat for 18 cents.' He says:
'Oh, no, you won't. I won't pay that.'
Then \ you say : j 'Well, what will you pay
for It?' He â¢ then replies: 'I can get it
hauled for. 16 cents.' So you haul it for
16 cents a hundred. He generally tells
you, that if you. want the business you
must haul the : meat for the price he
names." - - . y
H President Stickney denied that his road
had paid any claims for damages or re
bates since the Grosscup Injunction.

BIG KAUFMANN
LOSING FLESH
Eoad Work in Warm Weath
er Has Its Effect on Husky
Olympic Club Champion
The warm weather the past few days
has had its effect^ on Al Kaufmann.
Each morning when he goes out on
the road the big Olympic Club boxer
takes off a pound or two more than he
would during the cool weather and as
a result he is about four pounds light
er than ordinarily. - Yesterday when
Kaufmann came in from his run he
hopped on the scales and the beam' was
raised at 185 - pounds. If the warm
spell keeps up and Kaufman continues
In his drying process he is very apt
to enter the ring as light as 180 pounds
or perhaps lighter.
Joe Kennedy, who used to act as
sparring; mate for Jim Jeffries, went
over to Croll's yesterday and put the
gloves, on with the Olympian and the
four rounds they went through were
enjoyed by the big crowd in the gym
nasium. At the end of the bout Ken
nedy, was tired, while his younger and
fresher .opponent-waa as. gay as when
he first put the gloves on. Sparring
with. Teddy Ryodan and Willie Fitz
gerald was also a part of the after
noon's programme and the rest of the
stunt was made up chiefly of shadow
boxing and bag punching. Kaufmann
showed plainly by his work that he
was In good enough shape to go
twenty rounds at a mighty, fast clip.
Delaney said he never saw a man Im
prove so rapidly as Kaufmann does.
Harry Foley put in a hard day's
training down at Mlllett's yesterday
and his trainers were pleased with the
way he went about his work. Hl*
boxing with his three sparring part
ners â Jack Johnson. Landers and
Thomasâ was, of course, what Inter
ested the spectators most, but his wres
tling and work on the heavy bag is
what showed his condition off so well.
Foley never tired a bit under this
heavy work, which Is evidence of good
condition.
Tickets for the contest will be placed
on sale at Corbett's to-day.

Cargo of Railroad

The gasoline schooner Sotoyome was
towed into port yesterday in a water
logged condition, the result of springing
a leak which would have caused her to
cirk had her cargo been anything less
buoyant than lumber. She left Albion at
2 o'clock p. m. September 23 with 11,000
railroad ties for San Pedro. At 2 o'clock
p. ro. it was discovered that the vessel
â¢was leaking, and the engineer soon after
rojiorted that the pumps could not keep
thÂ«- vessel clear. Within three hours she
was full of water and unmanageable.
The second mate and two bailors were
sent &chore to telephone to Albion for
assistance, and at S p. m. that evening the
suam schooner Celia took the Sotoyome
In tow for San Francisco. Meanwhile it
had been necessary to lighten, the Soto
yome by getting rid of her deck load.
Two thousand ties were jettisoned.
The tug Sea King relieved the Celia of
her burden -yesterday outside the heads
and the Sotoyome was brought safely to
port.'
The Sotoyome is owned by the Albion
River Lumber Company. She is a new
vessel, of peculiar construction and con

ADMIRES WOMEN
OF THE COAST
Eev. Joseph H. Twichell ; of
Hartford Finds Them to Be
Both Strong and Worthy
METHODISM DISCUSSED
Pastor tf enness on
Mod a rciiical Complexion of
His Church at Meeting:
\u25a0 The Western woman has won the deep
admiration of the Rev. Joseph H. Twich
tll of Hartford, Conn; In speaking before
tf)^ Congregational ministers' meetlos
yesterday at jj the Young lien's Christian
Association hopaid her high compliment
for her, strength in religious" work.
The reverend gentleman ; udmitted that
this, his. first. visit so far, West/ had inter
ested him much. Besides the women who
had won his admiring attention, -he mar
veled at the : preponderance of young men,
saying that the Communities of the Pa
cific Coast, being so new, j had not had
time to make old men. -.
AVhen at the convention of the Ameri
can Board at Seattle last week he. had
noted that the " Christian woman was
sturdy, and he caw no/exception here in
San Francisco. v
Rev. Mr. Twichell declared that there is
a larger proportion of the strength of the
church of the Christian community. in the
womanhood lof ths coast than in older
communities, and he_was sure. that. the
church would be pretty^ poor without
them/ which was true everywhere.
The sturdy. young men and the strong,
good - women', 'he said, were the most
promising aspects of the situation, to-day.
. DUALS WITH PROBLEMS.
"Brotherhood of the Methodist Minis
ters':, was the subject of; an. address by
the Rev. C. X? Jenness of Berkeley be
fore the Methodist ministers' j meeting at
the Central Methodist Episcopal Church,
Mission street, yesterday.
Rev. Mr. Jenness dealt with the prob?
lems that are raised by the conflict be
tween the spirit of brotherhood and situ
ations which seem to call for unbrotherly
actions.
He referred to the occasion when a cer
tain .professor in Stanford v University,
then an associate of the speaker, charac
terized' the government of Methodism as
mediaeval because it was episcopal and
monarchical, rather than democratic
Â«Then, he said, a careful and close
study of comparative . politics revealed
the fact that the English cities gov
erned ,' under the monarchical idea
were better governed than the Ameri
can cities under the democratic idea.
Mr. Jenness went -into an elaborate
illustration of the conflict of individual
initiative with the city government,
showing that if the'individual take into
his own hands any vyork at all of the
civic authorities and do It hia own way
without authority or according to the
methods and law of the city he will
get himself Into trouble.
v Methodism, he held, was not medi
aeval, .but was monarchical In its or
ganization. It has prescribed the way
of doing things and for most situations
that can arise has fixed the responsi
bility for action. ; -
FOR THH GOO!) otr'THK.CHIIIIICk."
When the apparently harah things
became necessary for the. good of the
church the consistent Methodist, he
held; was not to call big. meetings to
create sentiment and muster majori
ties, which was democratic, but the
consistent method was to bring pres
sure to bear "Upon the officials who are
responsible. .
He held that in tue process of creat
ing mob sentiment the reputation and
character of the> one- involved were
sure tobe damaged beyond repair. and
his reputation was his only capital. .,
Dr. W. S. Matthew, presiding elder
for, San Francisco district, said he had
always regarded as providential that
their fathers in the celebrated confer
ence in 17&4 adopted a modified form
of episcopal government rather than
the more democratic form which Meth
odism took Jn England.
In America they, were in danger .-of
running /to .the extreme of democracy
in their national Government, while" in
England perhaps the danger had been
toward going to the extreme of cen
tralization. :
For the best interests of the church
here they needed, a balanced system of
government, which they had in the
Methodist Episcopal Church.
'-'â¢ Under a monarchical government,
said Dr. Matthew, the church govern
ment ought to be- democratic,, while
under a democratic national system
the church" government j should be epis
copal, under which system the people
had a large participation, while at the
same time 'there was a perfect bal
ancing of power. ,
v He said that for Methodism the high
est wisdom was to perfect their pres
ent system rather than to i try :to
change to the Congregational system.

the Finance Committee and requested
that his books and -records be exported
in , view of the fact that no auditing
of the sunic-Jhad been made in two
years. Oreif also asked for An addi
tional clerk to attend to the collec
tion of collateral inheritance taxes.
No action was . taken.
The committee directed Greif to in
vestigate whether 90* cents per page. is
a . fair charge for printing transcripts
on appeal. â The committee thoroughly
probed the matter three years ago and
was satisfied at the time that the price
is just. '. Greif is to see if conditions
have changed since then which will
warrant, a lower rate."
- Tiie committee directed the District

ABLE eases of disease to Rexraaio. and in
;"each" oas& the FIRST brief treatment. pro-
duced AMAZING beneficial results. I could
fill a page of the -CALL with details. Sev-

for the "first" time in years WALKED,

: firmly and honestly believe, quickly; and sat-
isfactorily behf-fit them. For 20 weary years
I was CRIPPLED with severest RHEUMA-
TISM, which his O-N-E treatment , of only
FIVE 'SECONDS' absolutely and "wholly"
removed' SEVERAL WEEKS ago, and to this
' 'date not the slishtpst sign" of a symptom
I-.as returned. I feel like a NEW MAN, and

Jf*w York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sejt. 25.â Speculative liquida
tion to-day overbore the resistance offered by
the stock market* through all of la*t week
and carried prices comprehensively to a lowez
level. The consolidation of the money sud
ply was the impelling cause. The volume of
offerings was large and the liquidation at
times showed eigns of urgency The day's
immediate factors in the money market have
been heraMed for weeks, but have been dis
\u25a0 regarded in the operations to advance cricts
The tenru>er of tb* stock market for many
Â£Â±y* has teen to discard prospective inCuence
and pay attention to nothing but the actual
rÂ»-tÂ«U-of credits In which atock market hold
ings were involved, iiuch recall was in force
oti a large scale to-day by the banks. The
conditions of the banks as they stood in the
showing cf the i-aturday bank statement and
the heavy credit requirements to be met this
week are abundant exslanation for the course
of the bank* in contracting loans, without tak- !
leg account of the renewal of the drain on '
their cash reserves, which was set up axain '
u-ith the opening of the week. Between cow '
tnd the close of the week payments are to
V- raade of an installment of subscription to
>- tefci-sen -convertible bonds, -which calli for
"â¢si2.oCo,lioo. and to an Installment of sub
scriptions to Pennsylvania convertible bonds
which caJls for $50, 000,000 except, as modified
by payments in- lull already made. As the
month closes with the week provision must
also be made for the quarterly settlement*, xhe
requirements for which are unusually large
this year. The calling loans was allowedly
preparation for the accommo<iaUon of these
ne<-<ls. Meantime the benefit secured by the
b&nks last week from sub-treasury payments
has been reversed by the completion of the
mid-month pension j<aymentg. To-day* sub
treafury statement chows a loss already by
the bunkt of *l,SÂ»lÂ»,000 and" the Government
Institution bad a large credit balance at the
clearing-house this morning. In addition J2OO -
000 was <3cr>oEited at the 6ub-treaÂ«ury to be
transferred by telegraph to St. Louis. The
ateertions circulated on Saturday that $5,000,
uoo w-ae already on the way to San Francisco
in Australian t?Gld found no confirmation, al
tbcugb condition* pointed to the possibility of
tui-h a movement. Assertions cf \u25a0 additional
gold purchases to-day In Lc-ndoc for New York
were vttiiieA OBty after tht market doted by
the announcement of about $1,800,000 secured.
Foreign 'exchance rose qaJte sharply in thlÂ»
rr.arket ond -;be" price of gold was marked
t;p in- LonJon. London had some difficulty
of Its ' own and was disturbed by reported
labor troubif,, in. the South African gold fields

COPPER STOCKS. \u0084
. BOSTON', Sept. 25. â The market to-day con
tinued very active, with Allouez. North Butte
and Copper Range the leaders, the buying
of all three being- especially good. The re
ports from the Allouez are phenomenal, but
even the best friends of the property do not
\u25a0 feel Justified in predicting that the present
showing can be maintained. The great .bulk
of selling the latter part of the day came from
the floor traders and' was mostly professional
profit on their part. -In view of the rapid
advance some stocks have had the closing was
very .satisfactory, to. the bulls and gives prom
ise of continued . activity.

; ' Future Ornln, and Provisions.' .
. CHICAGO. > Sept.' 25.*^The. wheat market. was
weak at the' start, initial quotations on De
cember being "off \i@V*c at $5y t c to 85% c. Tht
market wast . bearishly affected by a decline at
Liverpool. \u25a0 Much â¢ 0f ... the , weakness â¢at the
English market was-, attributed to an official
estimate of the wheat crop of Roumania. ' Ac
cording to tha official . statistics 100.C00.000|
bushels represents \, the total yield for, = thar
country this. year, as against. 52,000.000 bushels
last year. The average for the past vflve
years is given as f rom twenty-flye , to. nf ty^ per
cent less than . this., year's .crop." In , addition
to the foreign situation,, conditions In ! Amer-'
ica favored the. bears. In the" Northwest, the
weather continued 'to be" excellent for . : the
movement of the new crop. Receipts at" Min
neapolic and Dultith were, again liberal. Thi;
market lacked support from a- prominent bull
who. had be'?n on active â¢ buyer during ' last '
week. Cash houses arid commission* houses
were moderate sellers, but the volume of-bus
iness was not_Jarge. Announcement of ' an
increase cf â¢2,555,U00 ' bushsls in the" visible
"supply 'caused/ considerable 7*el"ng*. late" In
the session. \u25a0 As a result. December dropped
off. to S4 l / Â£@S4%c. , During the. last, hour part
of <the loss was regained on covering by shorts.
\u25a0 The market, .however, closed -easy with .De

RATE OR CORN
HURTS MILLERS
Pacific Coast Interests Are
Threatened by Decision
of Federal Commission
A clash between the milling interests
of the East and of the Pacific Coast
is imminent. The cause is the decision
. that the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion- Is reported to have reached re
warding the differential on the over
land railways from the Missouri River
to all Pacific Coast points on corn and
corn meal. The understanding is that
'-\he differential on corn and corn meal
is reduced from 10 to 5 cents per 100
" pounds. This reduction, if it shall be
put iv force, will enable the Eastern
millers vo have a great advantage over
ihose of the Pacific Coast and as a re
â¢sult of this consideration coast millers
are stirring about in. this city and
tlse where to try to have a rehearing of
the facts in the hope of securing a
licw decision.
Local millers said yesterday that the
â¢change in the differential would enable
the Eastern millers to capture the
toast trade very largely and a loss of
many thousands of dollars annually to
this coast could be easily foreseen.
\u25a0The Pacific Coast does not raise corn
\ery largely and the Pacific Coast
millers are compelled to bring that
grain in great quantities from the East
to' manufacture into breakfast foods.
The decision regarding the differentials
â¢will make it possible for the Eastern
â¢miller to lay down his preparations in
this market at the same freight rate
that California and other Pacific Coast
millers will be compelled to pay for
the corn in its natural state.
It is estimated that 100 pounds of
corn will not contain more than elxty
six pounds of corn meal when ground.
The Eastern millers will therefore be
placed in the same position relative to
their Pacific Coast competitors as if
they had to pay only for 100 pounds of
freight where the Pacific Coast millers
pay for 150 pounds, the raw corn as
freight being chargeable with the
waste, while the Eastern millers elim
inate the waste by process of manu
facture before they ship the goods
In this direction.
A controversy has been in progress
between the Eastern and Pacific Coast
milWrs regarding the differentials on
* I'orn and corn meal for about one year.
When the Interstate Commerce Com
mission ordered a heariflg, California
pent three representative millers East
to. appear and testify, two from this
city and one from Los Angeles. The
situation was fully discussed and the
claim of the Pacific Coast millers was
rxplained. The agitation has been
started again by an Associated Press
dispatch reporting that the Interstate
iViramcrce Commissioners have decided
against this coast and in favor of the
Eastern millers.
\u25a0 California millers have approached
4 he Southern Pacific Company and that
railway corporation Is engaged, so it
is= reported, in taking account of stocks
Â«Â»f corn and corn meal on this coast
to gain a full understanding of the
situation.' -> r >'.

taken in {consonance with an opinion
rendered by City-Attorney Long, who
held that 'the road .being commercial
jn; its character, the Supervisors have
the power to grant a franchise there
for under such conditions and regula-,
tions as they may determine to be nec
essary. The Street Committee's report
on the matter says: â¢â'\u25a0"
The bill provides for granting a franchise' f or
a double track railroad in me city and county
of San- Francisco, of. portions: of a proposed
electric road of about e:gnty-three miles in
length -connecting the city, of Santa Cruz with
. San Francisco. . Three routes : are provided for
in this city. - , : - â¢- â¢ --.':\u25a0 .. ' - \u0084
"Route No. '1. the .main line, runs from a
point on Illinois street Just south of Army, in
a general .westerly and southwesterly direction
to Islals Creek Basin to tne county line. .' The
grÃnt is made for fifty years and is so condi
tioned that the interests of the city and county
and its inhabitant* are thoroughly, safeguarded
in: every respect. ,
PROVISION FOR BRIDGES.
" Provision is made for tha construction \u25a0 of.
suitable bridges, viaducts and tunnels wherever
necessary, for appropriate raila, and poles, for
proper grade â¢ crossings, ror paving of , streets

Kancho to the -county line. This grant Is
made for twenty-five years, and, although cov
ering a branch line and an Integral part of an
interurban electric" system, nevertheless there
ie Inserted in the franchise a provision for the
payment of \u25a0, a percentage of the gross receipts
arising from the use and operation of â¢ this
route -in the sums and percentages expressed
in 'the i charter of the city and county; of San
Francisco with respect to street railroad fran-
Route No. 8 specifies lines for yard- track and
epur- track franchises for fifty years, covering
territory south of Army street and westerly
from MiEsouri street. The character of con
struction and general provisions applicable to
routes Nos. 1 and 2 apply to this route.- .
IS / COMMERCIAL ROAD.
Long's opinion says:
\u25a0 I "- conclude that the railroad to be built by
the Ocean Shore j Railway Company .is a com
mercial and not \u25a0\u25a0 a street railroad ; that the
srant'ot the privilege to construct and operate
the so-called Richmond branch can be made
upon the condition that it shall not be used
as a street railway, or upon any other reasonable
condition, and that such privilege cannot be
mad* the proper subject of â¢ competitive bid
ding. ' "\u25a0 . ,- ; - \: -"'â¢ \u25a0
V -An attorney who said he represented
another company which desired 7 to tra
verse the same territory) as the, Ocean
Shore asked that the ordinance be re
ferred again* to the Street Committee,
as he desired ".to.-bei heard relative -to
the illegality of granting a street rail
road franchise iwithout inviting, .bids
thereon. ;, Supervisor Gallagher | urged
that the request be granted, in- order
that the City Attorney's opinion might
be looked into.
Behrend. Jopst protested â¢ againsi
granting the 1 franchisee-claiming that
he held franchises v granted ten I years
ago to the Bay and Coast Company
and the San Francisco and West Shore
Company for a railroad;to Santa Cruz,
which, however, ?he had never built
owing to lack of funds./
Peter-Tarn'ony also filed ; a written
protest,, claiming that the proposed
raising of the grade of Mission : and
Canal streets '-by nine feet 'to accom
modate a tunnel.f or the -road -would
damage. his property,! and requesting
that damage claims be paid .by the
company before flnaL action- is taken.
: Braunhart -objected; to -any ,r., r . delay,
saying that^-more ', conditions - had I been

pany 'itlian could be j exacted -from / a
street" * railroad company :, under; . the
charter,, including one \u25a0requiring it to
pave the streets along which the roads
run from curb to 1 curb. .
ROUTE MAY BE CHANGED. ;
D'Ancona suggested that before the
ordinance is finally,, passed .the route; of
the park branch' be :changed from For
ty-eighth avenue to Forty-sixth ave-'
sue, as the city; might some. day want
to acquire a lj park -near . Lake Merced

SCHOOLMA'AM DANCES
AGAINST HER DESIRE
Whirled in Waltz by a Soldier
Rude Interruption
of Ramble in
Chinatown.
Judge Will
Fitly Punish the
Disturber.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
'When the lone schoolma'am from
Pennsylvania asked \u25a0 the hotel clerk if
a,,midd|e r aged \u25a0 spinster, could noctur
nally visit' Chinatown without seeing or
hearing anything that would shock her
sense- of propriety, he promptly and
heartily gave affirmative answer.
"With a licensed guide to put you
through," he said, "your blushes will
be spared." : ' . ' ,
7 "I'd hate, to go back; to Tarentum,"
she j said," "without having something
instructive to tell â¢ my. children â my
pupils, you knowâ -about San -Fran
cisco's Chinatown. 7 I suppose It's al
most. as> interesting: as the Portland
Exposition?''. ; s v \ .
'\u25a0"Wellâ Oh, yes," was the luminous
reply.' 7 -V. :. ''â¢ - - :
: Very favorably was the fair tourist
impressed by. the respectful - demeanor
of the Chinese - whom she encountered
as the trustworthy -guide -led her over
the' beaten paths. Even in the show
opium den, which she, entered^ with
grim expectation of having her optics
as well as her olfactories offended, she
found courtesy that was Chesterfleldian
until she- had declined to purchase a
photograph of ; the feline "dope fiend,"
and even then she was subjected to no
other . ungallantry than that of being
coldly -ignored. Strange to relate, it
was on "the "'highway iand at the hands
of ari Americanâ and; at* that an Amer
ican soldierâ she first received affront.
. Priyate George; Fay, an Infantryman
from the ; Presidio; .was also '"doing"
Chinatown, last Saturday^ night, when
t\e met the lady from Pennsylvania and
her," hired: cicerone^ as they ,,Â» emerged
from a lodging-house that a" rigid en
forcement of : the > cubic-air ordinance
and a liberal application of chloride of
lime have; deprived , of â¢ much of its
wonted> attractiveness to the lover of
unlovable sights and 'smells. The sol
dier; had been < drinking, else he jWOuld
not; have clasped the slim waist of the
schoolmistress abroad and waltzed her
over the asphalt. ; . So surprised was she
by the embrace that she could J riot j re
sist it," and the son of Mars had whirled
her around "at- least a dozen timeslere,
she J regained possession; of mind suffi
cient to'- enable; her 'to scream.! Her
guide, who was walking a few yards
ahead' of her when the waltz, began,
and until- then J'knew nothing of her
capture, quickly/ flew; to- 'her \ rescue.
After, releasing the drunken warrior's
clutch he -gave him" Into custody.
\u25a0\u25a0 "To /think,',', said the 1 lady to the
hotel clerk, "that '\u25a0 &\u25a0 sworn defender
of this enlightened j republic should do
such a thing while I-was receiving only
theikindest, treatment from the Chinese
beathens." \u25a0-' '
\*. So \u25a0 horrified was she by the experi
ence that she took train the next morn
ing,: after informing, the clerk that she
.jcould* ' never; regale \u25a0-. her : : pupils ; with
what she \u25a0â¢ sawl and heard In San Fran

â¢ No sooner was his compatriot pros
trated than Mariano drew from some
where in his clothing 'a.- twenty-two

American trio perceive the weapon than
they broke ground, and ran up the
stairs leading \o Union Square Hall.
Mariano pursued and fired a shot up
the stairway, but" the bullet .flew high,
and ere he could again pull the trigger
Deputy Sheriff Neil. Duffy had him in

The ' Board "of Supervisors yesterday
i adopted a resolution describing a proposal
to the qualified electors to amend the
charter so as to empower the city to

ments shall revert to and beconla the
property of the School Department.
The object of the amendment 13 to se

The Finance Committee declined to pass*
several demands of Phillips & Van Orden
for printing done for the Election Com
mission on the ground that bids had not
Been invited for the work and the charges
were excessive. Supervisor Payot eaid ha
had secured a bid of $250 for the same
work for which the firm had charged $300.
Grattan Phillips, a member of tha firm,
disputed the statement, but agreed to In
quire into the matter and made a reduc
tion In conformity with tha contract
prices if he finds any overcharges.
At the request of Jere T. Burke tha bill

more specific right to the usÂ» of tha spur
track. â¢

\u25a0 ' "As I -was reading tha dally paper I j
saw a testimonial of one -of your per- r
manent cures by the Cuticura treat-
ment. I know. by experience your
medicine is all it claims to be. I had a
baby boy three months old and eczema
broke out on'hia htad and face. I tried
several kinds of medicine without any
benefit, and then decided to try Cuticura.
I couldsee an improvement at once, and
in a very short time he waa entirely
healed. He ia now three years old and
a picture of health, : thanks to your
great remedies. One of ray neighbor's
children was also cured by the use of
Cuticura. She came to mo to ask what
I. used for my baby, aad I was mors
than ready to recommend Cuticura, be-
cause of the speedy cure of my baby.
She found the same result that I did.
