hMll.li WITHIN HIS PARTY.
The Bc-pubMcuji candidate suffered
heavily from campaign attacks charg
ing that he was a political assassin.
Alleged unworthy leaders of his own
party who had been thrust from office
and power largely through Harlan's
aggressiveness in previous campaigns
â were conspicuously absent from his
support. The result was painfully evi
dent before the balloting to-day had
been in progress an hour. Districts
â¢where Republican majorities had
seemed constant and time-honored as
the seasons were ominously reported
to-day as ""slow."

source of error in Re
pubh v â  tationf. An unmistak
suddenly manifested to-
Btri( ts where Afro- Americans
gave a severe jolt to
rjiican campaign managers. The
most plausible explanation was that
Judge Dunne, from the bench, had
shown an unexampled spirit of fair
loward colored men and women
in exigencies when freedom from race
prejudice was sorely needed.
The smallnes* of the Prohibition vote
warded by many as evidence that
temperance, voters, regarding Harlan as
a special enemy, voted for Dunne.
This antipathy to Harlan was due to
hie action in connection with local
option matters while a member of the
Board of Aldermen some years ago.
One of the amusing features that to
night is recalled as tending to center
good natured feeling in Judge Dunne's
behalf is his record as a father. He
is the happy parent of thirteen chil
dren.
HUMOR OF THK CAMPAIGN.
This phase of the campaign was
shared by "Pop" Anson, who has an
almost equally meritorious record in
family matters. Anson. the old-time
hero of baseball, was the Democratic
candidate for City Clerk. His popular
Â« rsonally was beyond doubt a po
tf'nt help to the Democrats! who seemed
t hugely appreciate his campaign sta
tistics designed to prove that the De
mocracy, at least in Chicago, was the
original and only genuine opponent of
race suicide.
The plurality for Dunne (D.) over
Harlan is 24.24S and he received a ma
jority of 545 of all the votes cast. In
the city election two years ago Harri-
IX) defeated Stewart (R.) by 7660
plurality. The city, however, was car
ried by the Republicans in the Presi
dential election last fall by a plurality
of nearly 110,000. John F. Smulski, Re
publican candidate for City Attorney,
â¢was re-elected by 15,000 plurality.
Bloch, Democrat, was elected City
Treasurer and Anson City Clerk.
The entire Socialist vote was 20.323.
John M. Harlan listened to the re
turns at the Republican headquarters.
As early as 7:30 o'clock he acknowl
edged defeat and left for his home.
"WTien asked for his opinion as to the
cause- of his defeat. Harlan said:

Sad Sequel to Marriage of
Chicago Belle and

Wife of Major Lyoch-Blosse Lies Dan
gerously 111 in a Â£an Fran
cisco Hospiial,
The honeymoon of Major Lynch-
BloEse and his fair young bride, who
was a former belle of Chicago, has
been marred most unhappily in this
'it y. Following closely upon the un
fortunate experiences of the couple at
the Palace Hdlel, Mrs. Lynch-Blosse,
humiliated and heartsore, has been
stricken down by illness and conveyed
to a local hospital, where she impa
tiently awaits the coming of her
mother, who is now speeding west
ward from Chicago as fast as the over
land fiver will carry her. She is due
here to-day and it is reported that she
will endeavor to take her sick and
disheartened daughter back to her for
mer home in Chicago.
The Lynch-Blosses arrived in San
Francisco about eight wÂ«>ks ago on
their wedding tour, which was to have
extended across the tranquil Pacific
to the scenes of the bloody rtrife in
the Far East, where Major Lynch -
Blosse was to have made observations
for his Government. He is attached
to the intelligence department of the?
headquarters staff of the British army,
and bears a reputation for vajor earn
ed during the war in South Africa and
while serving- in India. It was while
he war on his way to the Orient with
a number of other British army of
ficers, who have already reached their
that Major Lynch-Blosse met
and wooed the handsome daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Charles C. Germain of
<^hi< ago. The wedding was celebrated
in an elaborate manner and the happy
young couple immediately started
westward on their honeymoon.
Arriving here Major Lynoh-Blosse
met ooÃvHlal friend?, who were, in a
measure, responsible for his many sub
sequent troubles. They dined and feted
'h" officer and his bride, and after the
th^n happy wife had returned to their
apartments at the Palace these friends
joined vNfh the major in carousals that
rapidly depleted his finances and
eventually caused him to leave the Pal
ace, where his credit had been exhaust

due he explained that he was tempo
rarily embarrassed by reason of the
fact that his drafts had not arrived.
but. for some strange reason, they
never came, and the doors of his apart
ments were locked against him.
Humiliated by her experiences, for
which she had been in no way re
sponsible, the young wife grew ill
and her condition finally became such
that it was deemed advisable to re
move her to a local hospital, where
she is still an inmate, a physical wreck
as the result of the terrible nervous
strain to which she was subjected.
When her condition several days
ago took a serious turn her devoted
mother in Chicago was advised by
wire of her daughter's unfortunate
predicament, and immediately rev
sponded that she would start at once
for San Francisco. It was expected
that she would arrive yesterday at
the Palace Hotel, where accommoda^
tions had been engaged for her, but
it was learned at a late hour that she
would not arrive until to-day.
The Germains are prominent people
of Chicago, where Charles C. Germain
has been identified for a number of
years as a stock operator. When the
parents of Mrs. Lynch-Blosse learned
of her troubles at the Palace they ap
pealed to her to return home, offering
to forward her the necessary funds
for the homeward journey, but the
bride remained loyal to her reckless
husband until she was finally com
pelled by circumstances to make an
urgent appeal to her mother for
money to insure her removal to the
hospital that now shelters her.

PRESIDENT WELCOMED IN THE SOUTH
The South yesterday extended a gala welcome to President Roosevelt. He was the guest of the city of Louisvilte, and the enthusiasm with which
he was received demonstrated that his popularity is not bounded by geographical lines. In the course ot his address the chief executive said: "As a
reunited people we have the same right to feel pride in the valor of a man who conscientiously risked his life in the uniform of a Confederate that we
have in the man who wore the blue."

UREKTIXG IX LOUISVILLE.
Blue Grass State Extends Splendid
Welcome to Executive.
LOUISVILLE, April 4.â ln the shad
ow of a magnificent bronze statue of
Thomas Jefferson, just in front of the
courthouse of Jefferson County, Presi
dent Roosevelt to-day in something
less than fifteen minutes delivered a
notable address to a crowd that ex
tended for two blocks *on the east and
west sides of the speaker's stand,
which jammed the intersecting ave
nues and overran the broad lawns
which skirt the square. Not more than
one-fifth of those who saw the Presi
dent could hear what he said, but they
cheered him heartily nevertheless.
The President's reception in Ken
tucky was typical, and his reference to
a "united country," his reference to
the United Confederate Veterans as
"my comrades" and his allusion to the
wearer of the gray who bore aloft at
the head of the procession of escort
the "flag of one united country" great
ly pleased those who could hear him.
The President was in Louisville but
for two hour 6, but not a moment was
lost. His reception In the residence por
tion of the city was cordial, as he
passed through the business section it
was demonstrative of hearty good will,
and at the speaking stand, and on the
short drive over the business section,
it was an assured ovation.
The weather was cool and threaten
ing when the President arrived, t\ut
before the downtown district had been
reached the sun broke through the
clouds and shone gloriously. Every
where the crowds were enormous, but
orderly, and barring a little confusion
in front of the speaker's stand, the po
lice arrangements were execellent.
The President was greatly pleased
at the cordiality of the crowds and
much touched over the presentation
of three magnificent souvenirs, remlni
cent of Abraham Lincoln, which oc
curred a few moments before his train
departed for the Southwest.
CONFEDERATE^ IN LINE.
The President was welcomed to
Louisville by Acting Mayor Paul C.
Barth, in the absence of Mayor Got
tinger, who is ill, and by Thomas
Murray, chairman of the reception
committee. Preceded by a detail of
mounted police Â«nd by a mounted ci
vilian escort bearing the President's
colors, the President's carriage, in
which with him were Secretary Loeb,
Governor Beckham and Mr Murray,
moved forward, the procession being
under wav in a few minutes with Gen
eral John B. Castleman acting as grand
marshal.
Drawn up on Broadway between
Third and Fourth streets were the
George B. Easton camp of United
Confederate Veterans, two posts of
Grand Army men and the Spanish
War Veterans' Association. Louisville
has but a single camp of Confederates,
but it Is a large one and its members
were out in full strength numerically
with General John H. Leathers in
command.
INTRODUCED BY BECKHAM.
In introducing the President Gover
nor Beckham said:
"Ladies and Gentlemen â Not only
the people of Louisville but the peo
ple of all Kentucky rejoice to-day in
welcoming among us the President of
this great republic. Regardless of all
political differences we are here to do
honor, not only to the chief magistrate
of the country, but also to Theodore
Roosevelt the man. We realize his
eminent patriotism, his integrity, his
fearlessness and we all believe him to
be a friend of the great com'mou peo
ple throughout the country. We also
look forward to him. during the next
four years as the ruler of this repub
lic, to obliterate the Ifyst faint line of
sectional fllft*erenee tha'.t may fxist in
this country. I believe that It Is in
the power of this great man, who
more than any President since the big
brained and big hearted Lincoln
holds the affections and the confidence
of the people of this country â I say, I
believe it is more in his power than j
in the power of any other man to |
establish beyond question the fact that |
there is no North, no South, no East
and no West in this country."
SPEECH OF PRESIDENT.
As the President stepped on the
platform and the crowd saw him, a
prolonged cheer went up. The Presi
dent tried to speak, but good natured
ly waited until the applause had died
out. Then he said:
"Governor Beckham, and You. My
Fellow Americans â Surely any man
would, indeed, be gratified to be greet
ed in this way by such an audience,
and be introduced as you have intro
duced me, Governor Beckham. (Ap
plause).
"As the Governor has so well said,
upon all the important questions, the
questions that infinitely transcend
mere partisan differences, we are
fundamentally one. (Applause).
"For in the question of foreign and
international politics the points on
which there can be no proper division
on party lines infinitely exceed in num
ber those on which there can be such
division, and, Governor Beckham, 1
shall do all that in me lies to justify
the hope to which you have given ex
pression and to try to show myself
the President of all the people of the
United States.
"And, naturally, I feel particularly
gratified at seeing here to-day joined
in this procession the men who wore
the blue and the men who wore the
gray. (Applause.) In the dark days â
now, keep just as quiet as you can; you
won't be able to do anything more than
see me, anyhow (laughter and ap
plause) â in the dark days eaÂ«h of you
fought for the right as it was given
him to see the right (A voice, "That's
right"), and each of you has left us
the right to feel pride, not only in your
valor, but in your devotion to what
you conscientiously believed your duty.
(Great applause.)
REGARD FOR MEN LV GRAY.
"And now we are one. (Cheers and
long-continued applause.) And as a re
united people we have the same right
to feel pride in the valor of a man who
conscientiously risked his life in the
uniform of a Confederate that we have
in the man who wore the blue (ap
plause), and as I passed by your ranks,
O my friends in gray, to-day, and sa
luted the flag of our common country,
held up by a man in the gray uni
form, I felt that indeed we are one,
and that we have^been able to show
mankind that the greatest war of the
century can be followed by the most
perfect union that any nation now
knows.
"And in coming to this great and
beautiful city of yours I wish to con
gratulate you upon the history that is
found here.
"I am glad, as I say, of the spirit that
makes you wish to dedicate statues like
this of Jefferson, like the great statue
of Clay inside the courthouse. It is a
fine thing to keep to a sense of historic
continuity with the past, and there is
one statue that I wish the members in
the national Conjrress from Kentucky
to see is put up by the national Gov
ernment, and that is a national statue
to Andrew Jackson, and the victors of
the battle of New Orleans. The fight
at New Orleans was one in which the
whole nation had a share, as far as the
glory and the profit went, and the
whole nation, and not any one State,
should join in putting that statue up.
"Now. I am going to say good-by, be
cause there is a little movement there,
and it will be better for the women and

the small people if I let you get away.
Good-by."
WORD TO THE GERMANS.
As the President descended to the
platform from the speaker's stand the
voices of two male German singing so
cieties burst forth with the strains erf
"My Old Kentucky Home."
The President remained uncovered
until the famous song had been con
cluded. Then he spoke to the singers
as follows:
"Gentlemenâ l want to thank you for
coming here to sing to-day, and
want to say just one thing suggested
by your presence: We, as a people,
are composed of men from many differ
ent stocks from the Old World. Each
stock can contribute something of
great value to our national life. The
people of German origin who have
come here have contributed much in
many different ways, and not the least
of which they contributed was the
power to know what the joy of living
means (applause). There is one word
I wish it were possible to translate,
but as it is not possible I wish we could
adopt it absolutely as it isâgemueth
lichkeitâfor gemuethlichkeit is a
mighty valuable asset. I hope as mis
sionaries you will be able to teach us
what it means and how to practice it
all through. Good-by." (Daughter.)
SOUVENIRS OF LINCOLN.
The President and party again en
tered their carriages and after a short
drive through several streets in the
business district arrived at the Louis
ville Hotel.
In the parlors of the hotel occurred
one of the prettiest incidents of the
dayâ the presentation of souvenirs to
the executive. These consisted of a
massive silver flagon containing water
from a spring on the old Lincoln home
stead in Larue County; an inkstand
from an oak which shaded the spring
from which Lincoln drank when a lad,
and a beautiful silver vase filled with
orchids. The President was visibly
touched by these gifts, coming as they
did as a complete surprise. The pres
entation was made by Colonel R. T.
Durret, for twenty years a friend of
the President, and in whose library
Mr. Roosevelt years ago spent many
hours gaining information as to the
history of Kentucky and data as to the
Lewis and Clark expedition. Senator
McCreery was also present at the cere
mony.

St. Louis. Knots of people were scat
tered along the track, but as it had
been generally understood that the
train would not arrive until 8 o'clock
there were no crowds to see the Pres
ident's train and no demonstration be
yond cheering here and there along
the way.
Colonel Cecil Lxon. a member of
the Republican National Committee
from Texas, under whose guidance
the Jackrabbit hunt in Texas is to be
made, joined the party here.
The private car of A. A. Allen, vice
president and general manager of the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas road, was
attached in the yards and Allen will
remain with the party so long as the
train is on the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas system.
Switching continued until 8:30
when, with a long shriek from the
whistle of the big new engine, the
train plunged into its long run to
Texas with a pilot engine running
five minutes ahead.
THREE SPEECHES E\ ROLTE.
From Louisville to St. Louis Pres
ident Roosevelt took more than a
passing interest in Indiana and Illi
nois. At a dozen or more places the
train slowed dowr and at most of
these great crowds were at the station
cheering as long as the trafn was in
sight. The President made three
speeches en route. They were at
Mijltown, Ind. ; Huntlngton, Ind., and
Mount VernÂ»n, 111. At East Junction,
near Princeton, Ind., where a change
of engines was made, the President
jumped down from the rear platform
of the train to shake hands with a
number of employes of the railroad
shops there. The train ran through
Princeton slowly to give the Presi
dent an opportunity to hastily review
several hundred school children who
had been assembled near the railroad
tracks. At Huntington. Ind.. the
President said:
"Gentlemen and Ladiesâ lt is a great
pleasure to catch this glimpse of you
and greet you on my way down to the
reunion of my old regiment at San An
tonio, Tex. There is one thing I am al
ways impressed with in going through
this country, and that is that down at
the bottom, east or west, north or
south, wherever you meet the average
man, he is a pretty good American.
"In greeting all of you I want to say
that while I am particularly glad to
see the men and the women, I think I
am even more glad to see the children.
I think the American stock ia a mid
dling good one, and I do not want to
see it die out. I see here men who
wear the button that shows that they
fought in the great war. They have
left us a legacy not only of how to do
our duty In war, but in peace. Let us

LONDON. April 4.â ln the House of
Lords to-day the Earl of Jersey asked
the Government to say what action had
been taken regarding the treatment of
British traders by the German Govern
ment m the Marshall and Caroline isl
ands. His Lordship said the question
affected the general treatment of Brit

and it was the duty of the Government
i<Â» s-e that no right of British trade
was sacrificed or absorbed by Germany
or any other power.
Foreign Secretary Lansdowne said
the matter was engaging the close at

urgent representations had been

ada '-(I that the situation was most un

Lord Lansdowne said the German

had levfei duties which were paid into

STUDENT KILLED
BY CLASSMATE
Frank Allen, a student at the Lick
School of Mechanical Arts, was acci
dentally killed yesterday afternoon by
a hammer thrown by Arnold Brown, a
fellow student. The heavy leaden mis
sle struck the boy's skull near the base,
trashing through the bone. He was
taken to the Central Emergency Hos
pital, where he died without regaining
consciousness.
What makes the tragedy most pitiful
if that Allen was the only son of his
mother, a widow. Mrs. Allen arrived
at th>> hospital just a few moments be
fore hfr boy passed away. Her Â«rief
was terrible. Her cries chilled the
hearts of all who heard them. At
taches, hardened to the sight of death
in ugly forms and to the sound of sob
bing, could not bear to hear the moth
er's broken-hearted cry.
Mrs. Allen lost her husband when
Frank was a baby of 2 years. Ever
since that time she has struggled to
keep her son with her and to giv<Â»
him an education. He was all she had
to live for.
He grew from a prattling baby to a
merry, sturdy boy. Every day she
grew more proud of him. It was worth
the struggle and the self-sacrifice to
have such a son. When she grew old
she would have his sturdy arm to lean
uptm.
HE WAS GRATEFUL.
"Wait! Some day I will pay you
back for what you have done for me,"
he would say. And she would stroke
his head while tears or pride filled her
eyes.
God had given her a great comfort
in him.
Yesterday morning he kisted her
Good-bye and with his books under his
arm hurried out of the gate on his way
to school. She waUfched him till he dis
appeared with the wistful mother love
in her eyes.
In the afternoon she received a mes
sage that chilled fter with terror. Her
boy was hurt and she must come to
the hospital immediately. With all
the fervor of her soul she prayed as
she hurried to his bedside.
"No, oh. God, no," she muttered, "It
cannot be that. He is all I have.
Surely you will not take him from me."
When she reached the hospital she
read the awful truth in the doctor's
face. A piercing shriek, a broken
hearted mother's cry rang through
the wards. She tried to speak, but,
though her ashen lips moved, no
sound came fxom them.
She tottered to where her idol lay.
His head was svfathed in a bloody
bandage and his breath was a forced
gurgle. The end was very near.
"Frank," she moaned, "oh. my boy!
You cannot die! Oh, God, you can
not let him die!"
NO ANSWER CAME.
But the still form on the bed made no
reply. He would" never speak again.
She pressed her lips to his cheek, but
he did not know. He would never feel
her encircling arms again.
She prayed as only an agonized
mother can pray, but his breath grew
more labored, and he hung limp in her
arms. The gasping ceased and the
eelf-sacriflcing widow was alone in the
world.
They tried to take her away, but she
refused to leave the inanimate thing
that was her boy. When they took him
away in the rude coffin her sobs be
came wilder, and it was feared that she
would loose her reason.
Arnold Brown, who threw the mis
sile that killed the boy, was
shortly after the occurrence. He was
later released on $26 bail. The affair
was purely accidental.
Brown was practicing throwing the
hammer in the athletic grounds near
the school. He flung the missile over
the fence and it struck Allen upon
the head. Brown is the son of
Brainerd C. Brown of Alameda.
Frank Allen was 17 years old. He has
been living with his mother at 1422
Turk etreet.
ALAMEDA. April 4.â Brainerd C.
Brown," the father of Arnold Brown,
said for his son to-night : 7 J i ; '
Arnold and some classmate* were practicing
with an athletic hammer, when /the accident
occurred. : Arnold had = thrown the hammer ;bo
tar that it went over fence, r striking * Allen
'n the head. My son did not â¢*<? Allen ; at the
time and did not know what had occurred un

the more distressing because v Allen and my

day, declares that the reports of Rus
sia countermanding orders for war
material abroad are baseless and grow
out of the declination of foreign offers
with which the War Office and Ad
miralty have been swamped. He in
sists that there has been no relaxa
tion in the preparations to continue
the war. but says there will be no new
mobilization at present, explaining, as
stated in these dispatches, that. 140,
000 troops of the last mobilization
have already started for the front, and
that instead of mobilizing new troops
these will be followed by a portion of
this year's conscripts.
General Sakharoff denied emphati
cally that he ever intrigued against
Kuropatkin. affirming that he gave the
latter the most loyal support. At the
same time, in discussing the battle of
Mukden. Sakharoff declared the men
and material of the Russian army
were equal to those of the Japanese,
forcing the reluctant conclusion that
the Japanese generalship was superior
to the Russians.

SPOTTED FEVER
SERUM WANTED
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
NEW YORK. April 4.â Two facts of
great importance came to light to-day
in connection with the inquiry of the
New York meningitis commission into
the present epidemic.
First â The commission has found by
laboratory experiments that there is
a variation between the type of so
called meningitis germs in this epi
demic and the hitherto supposed nor
mal type of meningitis germ. This
foct has been communicated to the
commission by one of the leading
members â Professor E. K. Dunham â
who has oversight of the bacteriologi
cal investigation.
Second â It has been found that all
ordinary animals used in laboratory
work are immune to meningitis germs.
Guinea pigs and rabbits for instance,
show no bad effects when they are in
oculated. This is true of many other
animals and the commission is in a
dilemma at the very outset of its
search for. meningitis antitoxin. So
far, the only animals which have been
successfully inoculated are mice, whirh
are too small for practical use in sup
plying serum.
Professor Simon Flexner of the
Rockefeller Institute, is in charge of
the search for a serum.

them cast their votes that way. I be
lieved, and still believe, that our plans
for the settlement of the traction ques
tion are the best, but the people
thought differently and voted in ac
cordance with their convictions. There
is not much that can be said about my
defeat; the figures tell the story."
NOT A PERSONAL VICTORY.
"Party lines and personalities of can- j
didates were entirely forgotten in to- j
day's election," said Judge Dunne to-)
: night. 'Municipal ownership was the ;
i one great issue before the people of |
! Chicago, and the returns show very >
i plainly how the majority feel toward ;
â  the private ownership of public utili- .
! ties. It is the greatest victory munici- !
! pal ownership ever won in this coun- j
â  try
"Every pledge that I made during the
campaign will be kept. Chicago wants '
municipal ownership, and during my I
tenure of office it will be my aim to
bring about such a condition as rapidly [
as possible. I will appoint a corps of '
engineers to make a survey of all the I
street railways in the city, so that we j
will know just how the city, when ii j
secures control of the lines, will be able,
to handle the proposition.
"I believe that before many months
we will see the city of Chicago owning ;
and operating at least one street rail
way line. The traction question depends
in a great measure on the action of the
courts, but in the case where legal j
proceedings are pending I will endeavor j
to bring about an immediate settle- ;
ment.
"It will be years before the city will j
come into possession of all the street
railway franchises in Chicago, but we j
will gradually assume control of the
different lines, and I believe the day i
will come when the people will control
the entire street railway system of this ,
city."

committee can truly say that the real i
awakening occurred at the time the i
California Promotion Committee be- j
gan its operations, and figures prove
it."
The statement then called attention j
to the facts that the bank clearings in I
San Francisco increased from 1900 to
1904 something like $560,000.0-00. as
against $120,000,000 during the ten 'â 
years preceding, $350,000,000 of the
first mentioned increase being in the ;
last three years; that the real, estate j
sales from 1902 to 1904. inclusive,
averaged more than $46,000,000 a i
year, while in 1900 they were $18,500,- j
000. The statement also showed the
vast increase in building during the
last three years.
POPULATION FIGURES.
The tremendous increase in colonist
travel since the committee came into
existence is shown. Excerpts from the

ploitation through periodicals of national cir
culation. *
One reason for this is that the Eastern
publisher* now realize that the California Pro
motion Committee is an unprejudiced institu
tion, working for the whole State of California.
The committee is sending' special industrial
articles regularly to newspapers in some of
the middle Western States, and the results in
' lowa alone have been very marked.
The commit has made every endeavor,
1 and It has been successful In this endeavor,
j in bringing about a feeling of co-operation and
goodwill throughout 'the State. It hag estab-
I lished many development organizations in the
j interior . and inspired those :In . existence to
! fresh endeavor.
It has discouraged exaggerated literature and
j the promulgation of ill-founded booming
j propositions. â  ...
The State meetings that it haÂ« held in Sac-
I ramento and in Pasadena have brought the
people of the different sections of the State
into closer communion. 'â¢Â» â¢ ",
There lg no "doubt thpt thÂ« effort of .San
; Francisco men to build up the interior of Cal
( ifornia has had much to do with our present
I prosperity and with th* general feeling of
I goodwill that now exists throughout the State
, toward the city.
With the foundation established as it is and
the good results that have been shown from
this work it must appear to any one who is
interested In the prosperity of the State that
the work should be carried on even more vi*- '
j orously and aggressively than heretofore.
j ; , KNOWS OVER WORLD. .
Â» Besides the extensive work \ shown
j in the foregoing excerpts, the state
ment contains a record of a great many
other achievements in the publicity
and promotion work that are sure to
be of great benefit to the State. Mr. |
Jennings was cheered when he fin
| ished the reading.
Mr. Sbarboro spoke again and said:
I "We don't claim that all this great mi
i crease in the population, wealth and
prosperity of the State is due to our
c efforts, but we do claim the credit for
much of it. Millions of grains of seed
| have been planted that are bringing j
fruitful results throughout the world. !
The committee is beginning to be
known all over the globe." i
George W. McNear made the flnan- !
i cial statement as treasurer of the com- '
! mitten. It showed receipts during the
three years of $88,019.31 and expendi
i tures of $54,330.37
More could be accomplished if we
j had more to accomplish it with." said
Treasurer McNear. "We are living in ,
the best part of the world here. We
have the soil and the climate, and with j
the cheap fuel we possess, can become i
a manufacturing State. To get the '
j great population we should nave, there
I is lots for you to do. We must have
i our industries arranged so as to give
I employment to those who come arid
| our large tracts of land must be cut
\ up. We mustn't let those who come
: go teck' and say there is no work to
do and no small farms to be had. If
they cannot Â»ret employment because
the various unions will not admit them '
as members, that must be regulated." â¢
In conclusion Mr. McNear said the â¢
executive head of the committee was '
getting about one-fourth the salary ,
he was worth.
â  General Will S. Green of Colusa was
introduced by President Sbarboro as J
the man who had taken the first step i
| that had led to the formation of the
| Promotion Committee. He told how the j
the committee had its inception in Gen- j
era! Green's appearing before the
Chamber of Commerce and demand
ing' that San Francisco do something
to # d the interior " counties in their !
efforts at development.
"I wondered why the grand Sacra
mento Valley did not progress," said
General, Green, "and issued an Invita
tion to some gentlemen to meet me at I
'â "-d!and and see what could be done '
â¢ the way of development. Most of,
<-m said, "We are up against it!" We ,
. . :.ized. though, and worked without ;
money. There wasn't a Board of Trade
in the valley then outside of Sacra- j
mento. Now every town of any impor- .*
tance has one. We said San Francisco !
should help up. and we came down
there and talked to the Chamber of
Commerce and this organization was.
formed." â¢ . . j
LAXDS RISE IX VALUE.
General Green told of the great in
crease in the value of land in the Sac
ramento Valley since the development
work had begun and asked how much
that alone had added to the wealth of
San Francisco.
Charles F. O'Brien said San Fran
cisco would not develop without the de
velopment of the interior. He said if
he could take the members of the com- ;
mlttee tn Modesto. Fresno. Colusa.

General Stone said there was no bet

money in aid of the committee. Colonel

seeing the result of its labors. George

GOVERNOR OF ALASKA TERRI
TORY. WHO HAS BEEN RE
QIESTED TO RESIGN.
WASHINGTON, April 4.â A condi
tional request has been made an Hon.
John G. Brady, Governor of Alaska,
for his resignation. The sugges
tion was followed by Secretary
Hitchcock, under the direction of the
President, and notwithstanding it was
dispatched about a month ago, no re
sponse has yet been received.
The request grows out of the fact
that Governor Brady Is identified with
a mining company which is extensive
ly engaged in advertising its affairs.
The fact was brought to the attention
of the Secretary some weeks ago, and
he immediately took It up with the
President. He agreed that the case
was on a par with the charges made
against the Dawes Commission a year
ago, and the Secretary wrote to the
Governor, calling his attention to the
requirements of the department in mat
ters of this character and telling him
that he must either vacate his position
in the company or resign his office.

TURN TABLES
ON THE JOKER
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» fall.
TACOMA, April 4.â Colfax society is
enjoying a unique April fool joke per
petrated by two dozen Colfax matrons
pon Mrs. Kuhn of that town. Hav
.ng invited twenty-six women friends
to spend Saturday afternoon with her,
Mrs. Kuhn left home leaving on the
front door a placard bearing the words
"April fool."
When her guests arrived they en
joyed a laugh on themselves and then
pried open the kitchen window and
gained admittance to the house. Tak
ing their host's provisions for a Sunday
dinner the party telephoned for a gal
lon of ice cream and other delicacies.
The banquet was spread and thorough
ly enjoyed.
In the midst of the festivities Mr.
Kuhn returned home, but was denied
admittance. The same fate met the
housemaid and later Mrs. Kuhn. After
dinner the guests played "Five hun
dred." giving as prizes the finest cups
and saucers from Mrs. Kuhn's china
closet.
VALLEY ROADS
IN FINE SHAPE
WAWONA, April 4.â Twonty-three
Eastern tr.urists. the first of the sea
son to visit the Yosemite Valley,
reached here this evening. They re
port the valley looking at its very best,
the falls being unusually full and they
say there is no snow on the floor of
th*. valley.
The trails to Vernal and Nevada
Falls and to the top of Yosemite Falls
are now open for tourist travel. This
Is accounted for by the very mild win
ter in this section, although the Yo
semite Park Rangers report more snow
in the higher Sierras than there was
last year at this time.
The roads are in excellent condition,
the road through the upper grove of
Mariposa big trees being now open â
a very unusual thing at this time
of the year.
TALKS BEFORE
LABOR BUREAU
Key. William Rader Lec
tures to Association on
Reign of Common People
AUDIENCE IS ATTENTIVE
Speaker Says Development of
Patriotism Is Essential
to Life of Community
The Rev. William Rader spoke last
night before the Labor Bureau Asso
ciation at 915^j Market street. He
chose for his subject 'Uncle Sara, or
the Reign of the Common People." A
large audience listened attentively to
his remarks, and at the conclusion of
the lecture many asked the speaker
questions pertinent to the talk of the
evening. The giÂ»t of the lecturer's re
marks was that it was necessary for
the laboring men to understand that
they are the Government of the United
States. He said in part:
We are living in a very important hour.
President Roosevelt says that there is no in
ternational shadow hovering over us. Never
theless we have three problems before vs â
the nogro question, the subject of municipal
rule and the labor question. Oreat Britain
and the United States are the poltca of
the world.
We are a world power. This la our nation.
This is our country. It behooves us all to
use cur energies to a new sense of patriotism.
We want the patriotism that develops the es
sential life of the people. A large number of
the big m j n of the world come from the work
ing class. Take David Harum lor example.
He Is no picture of fiction. He lfves In every
day life. Characters like his are the big help
ers to the great masses. If wÂ« don't get
what we want we have a right to kick, but
kick according to law and order.
'."nmpare the conditions of the poor In the
Old World with that of the poor In this. Look
! at the great masses of foreigners who are
flocking to this country to come and live under
the Stars and Stripes. They are leaving
poverty for a land of sunshine, wealth and
freedom. We are the business nation of the
world, but I do not approv* of the Rockefeller
extravagant commercial enterprise.
Don't get p-esimistlc. It is better to look
on the sunny aide than the dark side of life.

Dr. Miles" Heart Cure 'has
made many hearts well after they
i have been pronounced hopeless. It
has completely cured thousands,
and will almost invariably cure or
[benefit every case of heart dis-
ease.
Short breath, pain around
heart, palpitation, fluttering, diz-
zy, fainting and smothering spelk
should not be neglected. Take Dr.
Miles" Heart Cure and see how
quickly you will be relieved.
It cannot make a new heart, but
will restore a sick one by strength-
â  erring the heart nerves and mus-
: cles, relieving the unnatural
I strain, and restoring its vitality.
"I had a very bad case of heart trouble.
For six months I could not work. Last
July I was plowing corn and feeling bail
all day; in the afternoon In plowing on*
â  row I had to lie down, or fall down,
three times. My heart throbbed as
though It would burst through, and I kns
difficulty in getting my breath. I pur*
chased a bottle of Dr. Miles' Heart Cure,
and before I had used half of it I con: j
lie down and sleep all night. Previous-
ly I had to get up from five to ten timÂ«*Â»
a â¢ night. I have taken several bottlps,
and my heart is as regular as clock work.
I feel like anew man. and can work con-
siderable for an old man, <('Â» years old."

PRELATE'S
OPINION OF
OIL BARON
Cardinal Gibbons on
the Rockefeller
Controversy.
Special Dlstxitch to The Call.
BALTIMORE, April 4.â Cardinal Gib
bons would be puzzled as to what
course to take if John D. Rockefeller
should offer the Roman Catholic
church $100,000 for missionary work. He
declared this to-night:
"I have read a great deal about Mr.
Rockefeller's offer and the objections
made to its acceptance by the Congre
gationalisls," said the Cardinal, "but 1
must confess that thus far I have been
unable to reach a positive conclusion.
I, therefore, hesitate about discussing
the matter further than to say that
there is much to be said on both sides
of the question.
'In my opinion no testimony has been
produced showing that Rockefeller ac
quired his fortune in any other than a
legitimate manner. Numerous asser
tions have been made; but, I repeat, no
proof has been forthcoming, and in the
absence of positive proof it manifestly
would be unfair for me or any one else
to pronounce judgment either one way
or the other. Neither have I any per
sonal knowledge of the man himself,
which fact forms another objection to
by entering into a discussion on the
subject.
"I might say, however, that if the
offer had been made to me. or to any
institution under my control, I would
be in some doubt as to how to act in
the premises."

HARRIMAN
PLANS BIG
PROJECTS
Significant Appeal to
Union Pacific
Holders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 4.â The an
nouncement was made to-night, after
a long meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Union Pacific Railroad
Company, that the directors had ap
proved a plan to issue $100,000,000 ad
ditional preferred stock, doubling the
present issue.
The purposes of the enormous in
crease in capital stock were not spe
cifically set forth in E. H. Harriman's
circular to the stockholders. He asked
their approval of the scheme, which
will be presented for the stockholders'
consideration at a special meeting to
be held in Salt Lake City on May 5
next. Incidentally the stockholders will
be asked to approve an amendment to
the articles of incorporation so that the
company can increase its capital obli
gations.
A significant statement is made in
this connection. The circular says this
policy should be adopted, "especially in
requirements such as arise in connec
tion with the acquisition of stocks of
other companies."
Harriman urges that this policy
should be followed, rather than to cre
ate fixed interest-bearing obligations.
Reference is made in a general way to
financing "coming requirements," but
no light or information is given in the
official circular as to the purpose of the
huge stock increase.

LETTEKS THKOW A
FLOOD OF LIGHT
Young New Yorker Assumes
Aggressive and Will Try
to Force Opponents Out of
Positions in the Society
[ ;
NEW YORK, April 4.â The fight in ! |
the Equitable Life Assurance Society j
assumed a new phase to-night, when !
several letters that heretofore have â 
have been carefully kept secret were I
made public. Further interest was \
aroused by a persistent report, emanat- j
ing from an apparently reliable source j
and so far not denied, that Vice Presi- ;
dent Hyde and his friends in the soci- .
ety had decided to a^surrve the aggres
sive. According to the report, the Hyde
party will force James YV. Alexander
and Gage E. Tarbell to retire from the ,
presidency and second vice presidency ;
respectively of the society at the meet
ing of the board of directors to be held
next Thursday.
This report was strengthened to- ;
night by the fact that both parties gave
out certain letters and statements bear- j
ing on the questions in dispute. Hyde's |
â¢ contribution was the letter which he
wrote to the Equitable directors on
' February. 15. when the fight for mutual
ization first came officially before the
board. At the time this letter was
. carefully guarded and only its general
i tenor was allowed to become known.
! The letter is a lengthy history of the
1 Equitable and Hyde's position under
j the terms: of his father's bequests, and i
' in it Hyde formally charges President :
: Alexander w ith "gross breach of trust
! to my fp.ther and me."
SHOT TAKEN AT TARBELL.
Alexander's contribution to the his
1 tory of the controversy ig his letter to
; the State Superintendent of Insurance,
\ defining his position and acquiescing in
j the compromise plan for the mutual- .
i ization of the society. It is interesting ;
in that he declared that his consent
I was given with reluctance, because he \
' felt that he could not take the respon- |
sibility of rejecting even the measure ;
of control by the policy holders.
On behalf of Hyde a statement was
given out with reference to this letter, !
which charges that Alexander's action
i in this matter was a breach of faith.
Second Vice President Gage E. Tar- ,
! bell is the target of an open state
: ment given out by Alexander S. Bacon,
counsel for certain policy holders. This
I statement declares that Tarbell is the
* real leader Qf the Alexander forces, and ;
i makes the charge that Tarbell, just ;
prior to the beginning of the present j
Controversy, sold back to the Equitable
for the sum of $135,000 all his interests
in renewals or future busi-.oss.
STATEMENT OF HYDE.
In Hyde's letter to the directors, he
' says he was called into conference with i
I President Alexander on February 3 ,
I when but two business days intervened â 
before the directors were to meet to ,
elect officers, and told that a "large j
j number of officers of the Equitable So- j
I ciety, under his leadership and initia- i
i tive, had signed a memorial addressed i
1 to the directors, demanding that eteps
! be taken which would result in placing
the policy holders in control of the cor
poration to the exclusion of the stock
control."
The letter also says he was given a
! legal opinion to the effect -that it was â¢
: the duty of the officers to bring this ,
! matter before the directors, together j
I with a paper signed by a majority of |
f the officers charging Hyde with per- |
j sonal unfltness for the office of vice i
president. The letter continues:
"Mr. Alexander demanded my imme- j
| diate consent that my control of the ;
company through the ownership of a
majority of Its stock be at once relin
quished; that I should consent that the j
functions of the stock should be"super- j
seded under a reorganization through |
which the vote of the policy holders by |
proxy should select a managament to
control the company and that I should
personally resign and withdraw abso
lutely from any connection with the
control or management of the com
pany, accompanying the demands by
i threats of exposure of improprieties on
. my part In both personal and official
' conduct, and impressing upon me that
the movement against me personally
had been so effectively organized as to
be resistless.
TUKXS ON ALEXANDER.
"I shall not in this statement under
take to discuss or palliate any personal j
indiscretions which may have given oc- j
casion for just criticism, but I have no j
I hesitation in contrasting all of these
1 with the attitude which has been taken
in this matter by James W. Alexand
der, a man of mature years, of wide
| business experience and of such abili
i ties that it is impossible he should
! have misconceived the solemn duties
devolved upon him under the instru
ment of trust executed by my father.
"On the sixth day of June, 1006, I will
have attained (should I live) the age
of 30 years, and will then, subject to
my duty to my father's expressed wish,
I have come into possession of my stock.
Thus shortly before the expiration of
that period, Mr. Alexander, owing his

The statement then takes up Presi
dent Alexander's letter of March 27 to
the State Superintendent of Insurance
and says:
' "When the question came before the
Superintendent last Tuesday the only
apparent opposition was on the Dart
of the Platt committee, controlled by
Mr. Platt. It now appears that this op
position was inspired by Mr. Alexan
der in the face of his agreement to the
terms and approval of the charter."
These letters and statements have
further increased the already keen In
terest in Thursday's meeting of tne
Equitable directors, which It is now
generally believed will be of a very
decisive character.
HARRIMAN CONTRADICTED.
Said to Have Borrowed Big Sura
From Equitable.
NEW YORK. April 4.â lt turns out
that Edward H. Harriman's statement,
printed to-day, is not fully accurate,
wherein he said, concerning the vast
loans of the Equitable: "Personally, I
never borrowed a dollar from the Equi
table Life Assurance Society."
High and competent authorities dis
puted to-day this statement of Harri
man's and said:
"It can be easily proved that the
loan which appears on page 10 of the
Equitable report to the Superintend
ent of Insurance on January 1, 1903.
was made to Harriman personally and
moreover was made on Harriman's
personal request. This loan was for
$2,700,000 on Union Pacific stock, the
par value of which at the time was
$3 600,000 and the market value at
the time $3,348,000."

Delius, contracting agent of the Chi

b^ the Coroner's jury, which returned
a verdict of suicide. News of the
tragedy did not reach the public un

Delius was a successful railroad
man, had bright prospects, and ill
health was practically unknown to
him.

edge of Missing Finery
Which Has Disappeared!
OAKLAND, April 4.â Detectives of
"two cities have been enlisted in the
search for several yards of B3ttenberg
lace, valued at â¢ $100. that disappeared
under mysterious circumstances from
the F. Thomas cleaning establishment
in San Francisco. The valuable fancy
â¢work is the property of Mrs. M. Kelly,
a guest at the Hotel St. Francis. The
trail led to Oakland. To-day Detec
tives Holland and Kyte searched the
premises of Mrs. Isabella. J. Martin,
1602 West street, of will-contest fame,
for the missing lace, but the hunt was
futile.
According to Miss Delia Schaefer,
one of Thomas' employes, who swore
o-ut a search warrant against Mrs.
Martin, the lace was missed imme
diately after the Oaklander's departure
from the store. Miss Schaefer told the
police that Mr?. Merlin had asked for
a glass of water in the store the day
the lace disappeared. Miss Schaefer
went to the back of the place and re
' turned shortly with the water. While
she was absent another girl in the
store, so Miss Schaefer asserts, noticed
â  movement by Mrs. Martin as if she
were trying to conceal something in
her clothing.
â¢Upon thJs statement the warrant was
issued. Miss Schaefer accompanying
the detectives to the Martin residence.
After the search Mrs. Martin denied
all knowledge of the lace and declared
eh*- -should take steps at once to assert
her innocence before the girl's em
plqyers. She added: ;
i ] mall not permit this girl to suffer, either,
for I understand sht must pay for the lost lace
or lose her position. The charge against me is
without any foundation.

Question Is One That Kay
Compel Company to Pro
fcect Public From Wires
I OAKLAND. April 4.â a telephone
, company be. held responsible for ac
; cidents occurring to persons coming in
| contact with the bare wires that have
! become charged from proximity to
I heavily charged electric wires? The
[solution may force telephone com
: panics to place more safeguards about
â  their wires and the question is one that
! a Judge and Jury are now struggling
| with in a suit brought by, the widow
! of the late Horace Horton against the
j Sunset Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany for 537,800 damages on account of
: his death from such an accident.
â¢ Judge Ellsworth this morning denied
'â  a nonsuit asked for by the attorneys
I for the company on the ground that
! Horton, when he took hold of the wires
! running down the side of his house,
! showed carelessness and committed a
j trespass on their property. In deny
! ing- the motion Judge Ellsworth made
: the following remarks upon this theory
of the case:
The evidence in the case shows that the
wires ran down the outside of the house and
, wÂ«sre not protected in any way. The telephone
had tn-'-n constantly ringing and it is a ques
! tion for the Jury to determine whether or not
it was not a private nuisance. The company
had received many complaints and it Is the
right of a man to abate a private nuisance with
the least possible injury.
If Horton took hold of- those wires to pull
[ them fiom the house as It is argued that he
i did, I think he had a right to, if the phone
! hat. become a nuisance. It is not to be sup
posed thet he imagined there was any danger
or he would not have touched them. ThÂ»
fuses to protect the telephone from destruction
from a heavy current were placed close to the
ground and afforded no protection to Horton,
who grasfjiod the wires some five feet from
the ground.
These matters I do not feel inclined to take
out of the hands of the jury, for I believe they
are pmper for its consideration and I shall
deny tUe motion and it is so ordered.
The trial of the case was resumed
this afternoon and the attorneys for
| the telephone company began putting
i in their side of the case.
METCALF SENDS
CONGRATULATION
OAKLAND, April 4.â Victor H. Met
calf. Secretary of the Department

a message to Oakland congratulating
Frank K. Mott on his election as

wishes, believe, me, sincerely yours

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. APRIL 5, 1905
GUNS ARE USED
IN OYSTER WAR
Armed 3len Guard Valuable
Beds for WTiich Rival
(Ompanies Are Fighting
WORKERS FACE SHOT
Attempt to Stake Disputed
Lands Is Resisted by a
Boatload of Gunlighters
OAKLAND, April 4.^-Once again the
ar over the oyster beds off the San
Leandro water front has broken out,
and so bitter is the feud between the
rival companies which claim the beds
that shotgun guards have been em
ployed to hold the contested claims.
The oyster war is being waged by the
L. W. Smith Oyster Company on one
side and the Darbee-Immell Company
on the other, and both companies are
determined to possess the contested
oyster beds, even at the cost of shed
ding human blood.
A few days ago the Darbee-Immell
Company hired a man by the name of
Mathiesen to drive a line of stakes out
lining the lands cjaimed by that com
pany, which are also claimed by the
Smith Company. As soon as the work
was begun L. W. Smith sent a launch
from San Francisco loaded with armed
men, and Mathiesen and the employes
of the rival company were driven from
the beds on pain of being filled full of
shot if they attempted to return.
The Smith Company has erected a
house on piles, covering the oyster beds
claimed by it, and shotgun guards are
on the watch, day and night, to pre
vent a flanking movement by the co
horts of the Darbee-Immell Company.
EXPLANATIONS

DURING LENT
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND. April 4.â Blessed are the San
Franciscans, for they shall see "Parsifal,"
and we suburbanites are near enough to be
included among the blessed. Buch prepara
tion there Is, too. for the great event. Tenny
son la the fad. and every one has "The Idylls
of the King" at his or herâ mostly herâ
tongue-tips and you are not up to date if you
have not heard at least one "Parsifal lec
ture Which really all goes to show that we
woolly Westerners appreciate the magnificent
opportunity that has come to us and, appre
ciating, we prepare ourselves In fitting man
ner to enjoy Wagner's sublime creation.
At Miss Head's school yesterday afternoon

Cheney. Mrs. F. M. Smith, Mrs. Charles But
ters, Mrs. J. C. Lynch, Mrs. Clinton Day, Mrs.
John Bakewell. Mrs. W. B. C. de Fremery,
Miss Caroline Little and Miss Ethel Moots.
At a muslcale given by the Catholic Ladies'
Aid Society yesterday afternoon, "Parsifal"
was discussed by Rev. F. X. Morrison. There
ha? been so much agitation as to the morality
of Wagner's masterpiece that Dr. Morrison's
views were of more than ordinary interest.
With other broadminded Intellects he main
tains that there can be no immorality in the
noble story of the triumph of good over evil
so delicately and so sublimely told by the
great composer. Dr. Morrison's talk closed a
pleasant afternoon of music contributed by
Mi?s Marian Fitton and Mrs. Brady at the
piano and Miss Nellie Whelan, who sang two

HIBERNIANS TO ATTEND
EARLY MASS IN BODY
Will Assemble by Divisions Sunday
Morning and March to St.
Francis Church.
The constitution of the Ancient Or
der of Hibernians requires that the
members receive the communion of
their church once a year. Where di
visions are organized the members pa
rade to the church selected. In a large
city where there are many divisions
the parade is an interesting spectacle
and as it takes place at an early hour
of the morning is a strange sight to
early risers. In acordance with this
law the order in this city will assem
ble next Sunday morning at Hibernia
Hall, 120 Ninth street, at 7 o'clock.
It will then march in a body according
to division regulations to St. Francis
Church, Vallejo street, where it will
attend 8 o'clock mass and receive
communion.
Rev. Father Caraher, who is State
as well as county chaplain, will preach
the sermon. The regalia of the order
will be worn on the line of march. A
very large attendance is expected, as
the county board at its last meeting
issued a strong circular to the mem
bers. At the head of the column the
officers of the county organization will
lead the line, as follows: President
Michael Donohoe, Vice 'President Je

EASTERN STORY
SOUNDS FISHY
Professor Jacques Loeb Be
lieves Chicago Scientists
Have Been Misrepresented
NO LIFE FROM DEATH
Explanation of Possible Er
ror Made by Those Who
.Reported Guthrie's Words
BERKELEY, April 4. â Dr. Jacques
Loeb, whose experiments at the Uni
versity of California in the field of
biology have given him international
fame, is unable to believe that his for
mer colleagues of the University of
Chicago, who recently were reported
to have brought dead animals back to
life, have accomplished that note
vorthy feat.
Before his work at the State Uni
versity here was begun Professor Loeb
occupied a similar position at the
University of Chicago. He was suc
ceeded by Professor Stewart. The lat
ter's assistant is Professor Charles C.
Guthrie, why now is credited with the
statement, publicly made at a recent
session of the American Naturalists'
Society, that experiments conducted
by Stewart and Guthrie, following in
the wake of Professor Loeb's experi
ments, had resulted in producing ap
parent signs of life in animals that
were known to be dead.
Dr. Loeb thinks that Professor
Guthrie has been misunderstood. He
is unable to believe that the Chicago
man actually made the statement at
tributed to him. The possibility of
restoring life to dead animals is not,
apparently, within the scope of Dr.
Loeb's belief. His experiments have
been directed to the discovery of the
secret of life, his experiments^ with
sea urchins, some of which ha\le been
artificially fertilized under his direc
tion, constituting an important addi
tion to scientific knowledge. He haa
not concerned himself with attempts
to restore life.
Dr. Stewart, he says, is an intimate
friend of his, with whom he associ
ated at the University of Chicago, and
who took his place when he came to
California. Dr. Loeb says:
Professor Guthrie' b remarks have been mis
understood. I suppose. He doubtless referred
to the common experience of physiologist*,
who all know that muscular movements occur,
under certain conditions, after life is extinct.
That reference has been misunderstood. 01
distorted, possibly into the statement that life
was restored aÂ« the result of certain experi
ments.

ATHERTON CASE
GIVEN AIRING
BERKELEY, April 4.â The Board of
Education to-night received a protest,
signed by a number of citizens, against
the continued employment of A. W.
Atherton, who was appointed to the
principalship of the newly established
night school at the last meeting of the
board, two weeks ago.
Atherton receives a salary of JSO a
month in his new position. He pub
lishes a weekly paper, as an incidental
venture, and his friends declare that
the strictures upon various citizens in
the Atherton periodical are responsible
for the enmity exhibited by those who
would now see him ousted from the
School Department of Berkeley.
The School Department received Ath
erton's resignation as one of its- officials
In 1901, he having been at that time
principal of the Commercial School.
Charges regarding hie fitness as a
member of the department were made
at the time as a result of an argument
between Athe-rton and a young woman
connected with the schools of the town.
Atherton resigned, he declares, of his
own volition, and he now resents the
statement in the protest filed with the
board to-night that he was once dis
charged or relieved of his duties "for
cause" by the Board of Education.
Citizens appeared before the board,
in support of a protest against Ather
ton's appointment. Speeches were made
in which Atherton's career was re
viewed, and his past record was de
clared discreditable. Atherton replied
in his own defense. The board finally
decided to defer action upon the protest
until the first meeting in June, when
the school of which Mr. Atherton was
appointed principal will be closed.

DOES HALF DAYS WORK
IX LESS THAN AX HOUR
Remarkable Strength is Displayed
by Miner at Camp on Gavin
Gnlch. in Alaska.
TACOMA, April 4. â A remarkable
feat of strength was performed last
month on Gavin Gulch, in the Klon
dike district, when a large assembly
of miners saw Charles Cook hoist
fifty-five ten-pan buckets of frozen
dirt from a 35-foot shaft in sixty min
utes, lacking fifteen seconds. Besides
hoisting the buckets Cook had to
drag them to the edge of the dump
twelve feet from the shaft, empty
them and return the buckets to the
bottom ot the shaft. It is believed
that this exhibition established a new
world's record.
Several days later from a 68-foot
shaft Cook hoisted thirty-three four
teen-pan buckets in sixty minutes. His
effort in each case equals a good half
day's work by an ordinary man.

ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHN MeNACGHT Manager
rVBLJCA^ION OFFICE.. THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. BAN FRANCISCO ,
WEDXESDAY APRIL 5. 1905
THE CITY GOVERNMENT.
THE CALL has sought to arouse the civic spirit of this city, and
OS attention, timely, upon the emergency that wiP be n,>.>n
us in the election of next November. The preparation needful
oonM be made in more way? than one. It could be by the organiza
tion of a non-partisan citizens' movement, or by creating an ad
- 'ry and rationalizing body like the Municipal League in Oakland,
OT, finally, by an organization within the Republican party, commit
to the high purpose of compelling a just and fair result at the
party primary, which would reflect the aspirations of the people for
betterment in the city government.
We have reasoned out. for the benefit of our readers, each of
plans, without being inflexibly committed to either, but with
effect the purpose which either might accomplish.
At last public sentiment has apparently settled upon one. The or
ganization of a Republican committee of 250 furnishes a nucleus
â mid which every decent aspiration may rally for the purpose of
a pore primary, a representative convention that shall be a delibera
ind the nomination by it of a ticket that will deserve, and
re fore will command, the support of every good citizen, regardless
"iv party affiliation. With this we are entirely in accord.
'IT be attained is our object, and the means are secondary,
. ided they be just, proper and effective.
It is the duty now of every good citizen to hold up ihe ham's
â  the committee, to extend it into every precinct, to equip it for
\ n duty it must perform at the polls, and to make effective, by
rking and voting for. the result accomplished by its labors. Every
imc knows the danger of having three tickets in the field, the two
party tickets being manipulated by the same push. LJp to this
the purpose of the Democratic organization is unknown, but
- known, that there are thousands of voter? of that party in
W Francisco who are actuated by high motives, and to whom a
, vernment by graft, with officers in every department moved
the lowest purposes, is a stench and an offense. We are persuaded
Mien will come to the rescue of the city by supporting: a
m and decent Republican ticket, made up of citizens of hijfeti
character and good ability, who will give their time conscientiously
making clean the places that have been made dirty.
It is a shocking condition of government when graft is accepted
as inevitable in those departments that most affect the public wel
fare. It is humiliating to good citizens to see official power used
"penly and brazenly to defend felons who have committed crimes at
:h< :ion and urgency of city officials. It is a final shame to
:he city that the president of one of the great departmental boards is

curement. It is an affront calling for the keenest resentment that
- official is permitted to continue in office while under indictment.
wing his salary from taxpayers whose rights he attempted to sub
â  by criminal methods in behalf of a criminal.
The official history of this city has some rough chapters, but in
v ts there written worse than this. The chief executive of the
city seems unconscious of his duty to align himself with the lawful
as^rtt of the people, the Grand Jury, jn its effort to punish the crim
inals who. if they have operated unknown to him. have basely be
trayed his confidence. He does not seem to understand that by
â¢ ing in efforts to embarrass investigation, to hamper the
rand Jury, and by continuing his confidence in those who have be
trayed it. he puts himself on the side of graft and crime, instead of
standing with the purifying forces of the city. We desire to be en
tirely just to the Mayor. The city charter puts upon him the whole
-ponsibility for the character of the city administration. He is
alone responsible for it. Does he wish to be responsible for the
crimes and offenses that have been revealed, and for those not yet
punished which are matters of common knowledge?
The situation leaves to our citizens no choice except an orderly
revolt. They must do this or surrender utterly. There are those
who say that the organization of the committee of 250 in the Re
publican party is without precedent. So is the condition which the.
committee intends to correct. The other side has made precedents
mat itself. It was without precedent for a member of the Re
publican committee to take "a leave of absence" during a campaign
m order 10 fight his party and its nominee, and then return with all
his treacheries upon him. ,
The committee of 250 will ask no leave of absence from the
party. It proposes to be present, and watchful and alert. If.- as is
suspected, the leave of absence manipulator has control of the regu
lar committee, the committee of 250 intends at the primaries to
create a convention, representing the members of the party who
do not take leaves to fight its ticket, and that convention will make
a party committee that is in harmony with the desire of all decent
men that the party be made the means and instrument of good gov
ernment, and that it be no longer disgraced by serving the purpose
of grafters and criminals, who dodge out and dodge back into its
ranks as suits their evil purpose.
The committee of 250 has nothing to conceal. It is in the field
to guard the primary, get mtt the voters who are in harmony with its
purpose, and to lift from the city the mantle of shame in which it
has been clothed.
AN EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT.
LEST we forget the glory of our sylvan possessions the Pacific
Coa^t Forest. Fish and Game Association has been ambitiously
energetic enough to prepare in the midst of the city a clever
presentation of a forest, redolent with the healthful smell of the
woods, full of specimens of our game, beautified with miniature
lakes, showing in vista the mountain scenery and suggesting in many
ways the good of outdoor life, camping, fishing, hunting, the studies
of the naturalist, the value of timber and all the ways in which the
woodland wealth of California and the coast is so excellent.
A part of the design of the exhibition is to be educative to city
people, who, without such picturesque and close-home reminders,
might not realize what there is to enjoy, to preserve by their appre
ciation and influence, and to tell to their Eastern friends and so
attract them here, in our possession of such forests, lakes, streams
and mountains, such unsurpassed camping grounds, sport and re
juvenating and inspiring outing places.
Of the exhibition it may be said : "It is to educate." All the
Eastern people who are visiting here should be invited to see it ; all
the busy people who by their occupation are permanently cooped up
in the city should take an hour off to stroll through its fair wood
land semblance; and the children should be shown it in order to
turn their attention toward nature study, and to stir in them the
1 bought that to influence the safeguarding of our sylvan advantages
it a part of civic virtue.
The fifty citizens who are chiefly instrumental in getting up
this clever exhibition have done a good work for the coast, both as to
material wealth in saving the forests and maintaining our prestige
as a tourists' paradise, and by instilling a fresh charm into the souls
of our developing youth by prompting them to nature study and
reminding them of the health and happiness to be found out in the
open, and of the wisdom that will come of thoughtful sojourn some
times in beautiful woodland ways. The exhibition is not a scheme
for money making, but a plan for public benefit, and the people of
our city and the Eastern visitors here should be made to realize this,
to appreciate the purpose of this attractive sylvan show and to avail
themselves of its educational power.

THE FATE OF
THE PATROL
FRANK H. SWEET
AS the factor's patrol, as it was
railed, emerged from the trees,
a man came from the cabin, a
man as strong and powerfully â 
built as Raoul the leader. He
was followed by several dogs, which,
made straight for the stranger.
"Here, you, come back!" the man
called. Then, as the dogs obeyed, he
advanced with outstretched hand and
ihe greetings "Glad to see you. strang
ers. Your the first outside faces since
I ran across one of your trapper hunt
ers, nearly a year ago. I like solitude,
but not too much of it."
Raoul made a grimace. He wished
the man had shown a hostile front. It
would be better to disclose their er
rand at once.
"We have come" â he began, but
was cut short by the cordial grasp of
the man's hand.
"I see, to have some hunting. Well,
this valley has plenty of it, and you're
welcome. I'm sorry my cabin's so
small: but it's just about as pleasant
outside now. You must make your
camp right between the cabin and
stream, so we can be neighbors. But
pardon me. my name's Jean Leblanc."
He waited inquiringly, and perforce
Raoul answered. "You may call me
Raoul, and these," pointing to hifl men,
one after the other, "are Jacques,
Louis. Pierre. Octave, Henri and
Prosper."
"All good French names," approv
ingly. "Well, Raoul, if you and these
friends are not too tired I would like
you to go along with us after the bigr
g<Â»Pt bear I ever saw. He killed a dog

a member for a variety of reasons, if two-thirds vote for sttch action.
The Illinois House recently expelled a member who had made
charges of criminality against his colleagues, which he failed to sub
stantiate. He was held to have exceeded his privilege as a member
and to be in contempt of the House, and expulsion followed.
The California Senate made a precedent in its expulsion of the
four members for the crime of bribery. Up to that time no Legisla
ture in the United States had taken such action in punishment of that
offense. Members charged with bribery had resigned, and some
had been suspended, but none had been expelled. The Senate, having
no precedent, made one, greatly to its honor and in vindication of its
dignity. Under such circumstances the courts have no power to
force back into a Legislature men judged by it unfit to sit with its
members by reason of crime.
Legislatures have great latitude in such matters, which they
must use with care and an eye to justice. The acctjsed Senators in
some cases appeared in their seats and voted upon bills. This is in
sufferable, but the Senate could prevent it only by expulsion. A3
long as they were members there was no power to prevent their
acting as stich. No court will ever compel laws to be made or un
made by the votes of men under indictment for crimes against the
body of which they are members. It is no solution to say that any
of their constituencies would re-elect them or any of them. That
does not rob the Senate of the power to again expel them. Tweed
was elected to the New York Senate after a partial exposure of his
crimes against New York City, and was permitted to take his seat,
on the theory that his constituency had a right to representation.
While that was the theory, the real reason was that Tammany had
sufficient power at that time to protect its chief. The subsequent fate
of Tweed made it impossible for such legislative degradation to
happen in New York again.
We believe that the California Senate, acting upon its rights,
made a precedent that will have a purifying effect upon all coming
Legislatures in this State.

OF ENVOY IN

CARACAS. Venezuela, March 20.â
Great excitement prevailed between
i United States Minister Bowen and the ,
! French Minister over the French ca- '<

that two French warships,
Julien de la Graviere and i
Duplex, have been ordered |
to Venezuela.

discuss Monroe doctrine, |
"big stick policy," and go '
home to report to their gov- I
ernments by cable.
:8:00 A.M. â President Castro is seen 1
drinking coffee and smoking
cigarettes. What was
thought to be pajamas turns
out to be a white linen suit. 1
8:01A.M. â The Dutch Minister;
threatens to join with ,
France in shooting up Car
acas and other points be- :
cause of the treatment of j
citizens of Holland.
8:02 A. M. â Minister Bowen has more
"grave fears" and sends a
substitute report to Wash
ington.
, 8:03 A. M.â President Castro is heard
humming a sons which a
Portuguese sailorman says is
Spanish for "It Was the
Dutch."
8:04 A.M. â "Grave fears" are again
entertained by all the Min

impatient and kill the bear herself."
That evening as the men were sit
ting by their camp fire smoking,
Pierre turned suddenly to Raoul.
"Did you tell Leblanc?" he asked.
Raoul knocked the ashes from his
pipe and gazed thoughtfully at the
lire.
"No," he answered. "I did not find
a good chance. To-morrow will be
time enough."
The next evening the question was
repeated in much the same tone, but
the answer was more impatient.
"If you are in such a hurry to get
back, Pierre," Raoul added, "you may
start by yourself to-night." And he
rose abruptly and sought his blanket.
A week later they were still there.
Then one day as Raoul was walking
along the bank of the stream, hum
ming the refrain of a little song which
Aliene had sung the evening before, he
saw Pierre leave the cabin and come
toward him. He ceased the humming
and advanced to meet him.
"I was just thinking of you, Pierre,"
he said. "I want â¢"
"One minute first, Raoul," inter
rupted Pierre, looking embarrassed.
"I have a little request to make. May
I have two or three days' absence?"
"For what?" wonderingly.
"Why, IâlI â I want to go down to thÂ«
post after Father Leclere. You see, I
â that is, Toinette and I have talked
it over. IâlI â I shall be sorry to leave
you, Raoul, but this valley is the best
place I ever saw for a home. There
is plenty of game and â and â "
"Yes, I understand. Pierre." said
Raoul kindly. There was an odd look
on his face as he added: "You may
go, of course. Tell Jacques I want to
see him."
Jacques was walking under the
pines with Suzette, but he came
promptly at the message.
"I want you to take the men and
go back to the post," Raoul ordered.
"The factor will be wondering where
we are. Tell him â what?"
For Jacques was shaking his head
and digging his big feet in the pine
needles.
"If you don't mind, Raoul," he said,
sheepishly, "I â I would rather you'd
send Louis â no, I mean Prosper â
Louis wants to stay here. You see
Pierre is going after Father Leclere,
and Suzette and Iâ"I â "
"Oh, yes, I see," dryly. "And Louis
wants to stay also. Is it Marie?"
"No," eagerly, "it's Josephine â Oc
tave has won Marie. They will bÂ«
married at the same time."
"And Henri and Prosper? Have they
talked It over with Jeanne and â oh, no,
there are not any more girls. Which
of them has spoken to Jeanne about
Father Leclere?"
Jacques grinned.
"Prosper has tried to," he answered,
"but Jeanne laughs in his face. She
says she don't want any man. They
need too much looking after. But then
Jeanne is young," philosophically. "She
will learn better. Prosper says he will
settle in the valley and wait."
"Bo," thoughtfully, "there is only
Henri to go back then?"
"And you, Raoul," Jacques suggest
ed.
"Oh, yes, of course. Well, tell Henri
to come here."
Before Henri came Raoul had labor
iously scrawled a note to the factor,
which read:
"My Dear Factorâ l did not have the
nerve to force the Intruders away. And
after all they have as much right her*
as we, and the country is large. Pierre
is starting to the post to-day after the
good father. When they return I shall
marry one of Leblanc's daughters,
Aliene, and settle in the valley. You
will have to look for a better man than
lam to fill my place. Yours,
"RAOUL."

LAURA BRIDE POWERS
The California Club had a beautiful I
yesterday.
. It was something like a summer's !
day in the Eastâ first sunshine, then j
clouds, then thunder, followed by an j
electric sturm. then sunshine againâ i
blesed, blessed sunshine!
And you may bank upon It that there
were no dull moments during that
feance. for it was nomination day, and I
a day of many deeds; wise and other- j
wise-
Speeches were made that were work- i
ing: models of perspicuity, precision, !
and politeness, and others, wellâ j
6ome weren't. i
Women are garrulous on the prin- |
clple that the greater the volume of i
words the weightier the argument â J
now, don't get cross, ladies, you know
it'a the truth. Then own up.
Whew! How women can chatter i
when they really get busy! And yet, j
judging from the turbulence in two [
well-known men's clubs, it would seem j
that ebullitions are not essentially
feminine performances. These verbose I
proclivities seem to belong to the hu- j
man biped, male and female pretty
much alike, and there's some comfort :
in that. ;
Now, the whole story hinged upon i
the proposition of inviting the Outdoor j
Art League to come into the club as a !
body, to form what the advocates
termed The Outdoor Art League De- j
partment."
While it was unanimously agreed J
that the personnel of the League was !
charming and altogether lovely and â 
valuable, it was not clear that the !
merging would increase the working I
values of either organization. And be- j
tides, there were men in the Outdoor .
Art League â think of It â men. j
But when the idea percolated Into i
the brains of the opposition that the j
men were only associate members and j
as such wouldn't bar the California j
Club from State federation privileges
âand that the men individually and i
collectively were so perfectly splen
did." then the storm subsided. And !
. when the ballots were counted and the j
opposition lost â and lost rather cheer- j
fullyâ the matter became a forgotten j
incident, almost. j
ifo it is agreed to invite the Outdoor :
Art. League to become an organic part
of the California Club, "for better or
for worse, for richer .or for poorer."
Aid peace be to the union. !
Af for the nomination, the following ;
r.arrts were duly offered:
For president. Mrs. Aylett Cotton, lnr-um- j

COURT LENIENT
WITH NEW BURGH
Judge Sea well Holds Attor
ney Was Provoked When
He Culled Byington a Name
ARGUMENT CONCLUDED
City Prosecutor Says Cigar
Men Seek Relief, Though
Are "I nclean"
The stenographer's notes saved At- '
torney A. S. Newburgh from punish
ment for contempt of court by Judge
Seawell yesterday. Monday afternoon,
during the argument on the pool-sell
ing cases. District Attorney Byington
called Newburgh a "laughing hyena"
and Newburgh replied in thunderous
tones that Byington was a "dirty dog."
Newburgh's remark astonished Judge
Seawell, who did not hear Byington's
original pleasantry, and the court or
dered Newburgh to show cause why
he should not be punished.
Newburgh protested that Byington
had started the trouble and should be
punished alone Judge Seawell said he
had net heard Byington make any un
dignified remark, hence Byington must
go unpunished. But the stenographer
caught Byington's remark, and when
Judge Seawell was informed of the
fact he decided that Newburgh waa
not so much to blame after all.
When the matter came up yesterday ,
Newburgh made further apologies to .
the court for his conduct. Judge Sea
well then said he had been informed
by the stenographer that the District
Attorney did start the controversy and
as NewDurgh had epoken in the heat i
of passion and had meant no offense
to the court the contempt proceedings
would be dropped. He warned counsel, I
however, to maintain proper decorum
in the future.
Police Captain Duke was called and
testified that he had ordered fourteen I
men to raid the pool-rooms of Zick
Abrams- He said he was instructed
to do as he did and was acting within
the law. His testimony in this case
was allowed to stand as applying to
all that will be effected by the decision
of the court. Detective Smith and
William Bryan, secretary of the Grand
Jury, also testified as to the sale of
pools by Abrams. Argument on the
merits of the case was then opened.
Attorney Newburgh said the action
of the police in blockading the cigar
stores was unlawful and in violation
of the constitutions of the State and
the United States. He said the police
had no right of entry to any place of
business unless authorized by warrant
properly issued by a properly quali
fied court If allowed to continue in
their course he said the police were
destined to become the despots of the
land and liberty would be at an end.
Attorney Michel, from the office of :
George D. Collins, closed the argument
for the pool-sellers, attacking the val- '
idity of the ordinance under which
the police are operating.
District Attorney Byington. in his
reply, said the applicants for writs of ;
injunction were not entitled to relief j
from a court of equity for they had i
not erne to court with clean hands.
Not having come to court with clean '
hands they could not, in the first place, '
get standing in a court of equity and in
the second place could not in an action
in equity attack the validity of any
statute or ordinance. And the court,
said Byington in conclusion, will never
enjoin an officer of the law from mak
ing an arrest, for the person arrested
has a remedy at law and equity can
. not be invoked where a remedy at law
' can be found.
The case*: will be submitted this
morning afier proof of an amendment
to an ordinance has been made.
JOSE BALLADS
WARM HEARTS
OF AUDIENCE
Richard Jose Bang 'Silver Threads
Among the Gold," the "Old Arbor
Tree," "The Angel at the Window,"
"Too Late" and some other ballads at
Lyric Hall last evening to a large
house, and he was enthusiastically ap
plauded after every ballad. Jose was in
hie most sentimental mood, and gave
the songs of earlier days peculiar zest
by his earnest singing. The crowd went
to hear Jose. That was evident when
ever he appeared on the stage. If he
had seen fit to continue all night there
is a probability that some one would
have remained to applaud him and aak
for more.
In the good old days when the bal
' lad. with its pretty stories of love or
I woe was the thing, fashion beat its
gloved hands and raised its voice in
favor of that form of composition.
With the fading of negro minstrelsy the
ballad has departed to some extent,
and it is fair to say that Jose is its
principal male exponent now on the
stage. Those who heard JoÂ«e laÂ«t night
â¢ knew that he was singing from his
heart. It waa odd to hear "Silver
Threads. " for instance, this having
been practically dead for a generation,
but it was very tuneful once, and Jose
reveled In it last night.
Apart from Jose the feature of hia
company is the all-around cleverness
of the Fuhrer family as players on va
rious at ringed instruments, and the
pleasing manner in which Miss Ruth
Estelle Weston sings such songs as
"The Land o1o 1 the Leal." The bright
particular star of the Fuhrer family
last evening was Bessie Rosamund
Fuhrer, who played a concerto by
Viotti with great Intelligence, an abun
dance of delicacy and precision and all
the technique that was required to the ,
full. Lucy Fuhrer supplied a cello solo
and three of the Fuhrers gave selec- ;
tions from "La Boh*-me."
Sues to Get Her Child.
The argument on the application of \
Mrs. Jennie L. Fisher for a writ of |
habeas corpus to recover possession of
her little girl from C. F. Rea. parent
by adoption, was partly heard before
Judge Jjawlor yesterday afternoon and
was continued till to-morrow. Mean
time the child was ordered into the
custody of Rea's housekeeper with in
structions that the mother could visit
the child at any time. It was lnti
, mated that the charge of child-stealing
against Mrs. Fisher would not be
, pressed in the Police Court.

A large audience heard the "Parsl

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. APRIL 5, 1905.
POLE CHOPPING
ACT DELAYED
Supervisors' Committee Gives
Corporations Plenty of
Time to Bury All Wires
HEWITT IS CENSURED
Result of Agitation May
Be the Ordering of Lines
of All Sorts Underground
Nobody need get up early this morn- j
ing in expectation of seeing Chief Hew
itt of the City Electrical Department
with his coat off chopping away at the
bases of telegraph poles, or his inspec
tors busily engaged in the cross-arms
picking off insulators and clipping
wires, as the orchardist picks apples
and snios twigs.
The joint committee of the Super- i
visors' Finance and Electricity Com- I
mittees, Brandenstein in the chair, held I
an investigating session yesterday and
granted the companies that are main- i
taining poles nearly a year to get them
down â time enough for the whole mat- \
ter to be forgotten unless improvement j
clubs are active.
The features of the session were a \
verbal passage between Superintend- !
ent Jaynes o-f the Western Union Tele- !
graph Company and President Goodall ;
of the San Francisco Electric Protec- :
tive Company, which owns the Pinker
ton burglar alarm system, and the re- j
buking of Chief Hewitt by Chairman
Brandenstein for giving permission to ;
the Goodall company to string over
head wires when it was granted a j
franchise on the agreement that Its ,
wires should be underground.
Goodall accused Jaynes of instigating j
the cruÃade against overhead wires in |
order to establish a monopoly for his j
own burglar alarm system, which uses |
the Western Union underground serv- |
Ice, and of using the Board of Super- i
visors to carry out the design. Jaynes j
promptly denied this and called upon ,
the members of the committee to bear [
witness to the fact that his company j
had said nothing about wires being re- j
moved. In defense of his company he i
went on to say that Hewitt had or- j
dered it to put its wires underground I
and then had granted the protective j
company permission to place wires j
overhead on the ground that it was on ;
the same basis as a messenger com
pany.
Hewitt hotly denied that he had is-
Bued such an order to the Western
Union Company. The most he had
done was to express the opinion to Mr.
Jaynes that all wires should be placed
underground, he said.
The result of the agitation will prob
ably be that the committee will recom
mend to the board the placing of all
wires, including those of the messenger
and burglar alarm systems, under
ground.
*The point of difference between the
burglar alarm and messenger services
was also a subject for discussion.
Jaynes said there was much difference,
because the burglar alarm service was
much more costly and carried a higher
voltage. Goodall said that the only
difference was that in one case by the
ringing of a bell you brought a six
foot man and in the other a four-foot
boy. The wires used by his company
carried a low voltage, he said.
A communication from the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company in
which it expressed a willingness to put
all wires belonging to it underground
as soon as the city got its wires off the
gas company's poles were read. S. L..
: Naphtaly. superintendent of the com
pany, promised that it would have all
, wires in districts 1, 2 and 3 under
ground ninety days after the city
i buried those belonging to it, and that
i those in district 4 by March L Chief
Hewitt said he thought the city could
' get its wires down by June 30, except
;in district 4, where the work might
take longer. T. V. Halsey of the tele
phone company said that corporation
would get its poleÃ down likewise.
The committee will meet again Fri
day afternoon and adopt resolutions to
be presented to the board.
F. L. Turpin, W. F. Perkins and R.
J. Hancock, representing the Ellis
etreet Improvement Club, were present
and got a promise for the immediate
removal of certain poles on Ellis, be
tween Powell and Mason.
TAXPAYERS ARE
STILL MULCTED
A number of angry property owners
appeared yesterday at the Tax Collec
tor's office and threatened to bring to
the attention of the Grand Jury the
firm of I. Franklin & Co., money brok
pre, who are doing a land-offlce busi
ness in the collection of rebate taxes
for schools and hospitals paid in 1902.
The firm has constituted itself agent
for many taxpayers who have called
at its office in response to postal cards
which had the appearance of having
been issued by the city.
The Call, two weeks ago. called at
tention to the questionable methods of
the concern, which is charging a com
mission of fifty per cent on the amount
of taxes recovered from the city. Not
withstanding the publicity given to the
matter hundreds of property owners
have gone to the firm, which! has of
fices in the Callaghan building, and
turned over to it their tax bills for
collection of the rebates. It is said
that the firm has cleared many thou
sands of dollars.
The firm is now sending out its pos
tal cards calling on property owners
to come and collect their claims with
the words "Final Notice" placed there
on with a rubber stamp. It appears
that when demands are ready in the
Auditor's office postal cards are sent
to the property owners apprising: them
that they can collect their money. In
the meantime a postal card may be re
ceived from the Franklin concern and
the taxpayer hies himself to the office
of the firm instead of to the City Hall.
The property owner is handed half of
his rlaim and then signs a receipt
which is in effect an assignment of his
claim to the brokers, who then collect
the full amount of the claim.

The festival committee of the Anci
ent order of Hibernians held its flrat

many new features and there will be a
liberal outlay to make the festival a

IMPURE WINES
UNDER THE BAN
Health Board Orders Sale
of Condemned Brands to
Cease on Pain of Arrest
MUST LABEL BOTTLES
Chief Bigelow BayÃ That
No Adulterated California
Goods Are Found in East
The Board of Health yesterday sent
out notices to the various dealers han
dling wines which upon analysis were
found by Chemist Gibbs of the Board
of Health to contain coloring matter
preservatives and in some instances
arsenic. The notice contains the desig
nation of the particular adulterant
used in the wine, and continues:
By order of the Board or HeaJth of the city
and county of San Francisco, you are hereby
notified that if you are to retain this wine for
the purpose of exposing: It for sale or sell the
same you must change the label now used and
use instead a label which will show the exact
Ingredients of that wine. This office will fur
nibh you with a complete list of the ingredi
ents in your wine. In the case where the sam
ple shows the presence of arsenic you are
hereby notified that this particular wine is
hereby condemned. Failure to observe this or
der will result In this adulterated lot of wine
being condemned and criminal proceedings In
stituted.
Health Officer Ragan stated yester
day that he has the authority of r>r.
W. D. Bigelow, Chief of the Pure Pood
Bureau of the Department of Agricul
ture, for the statement that California
wineÃ upon the Eastern markets are
of superior quality and it is very rare
ly that any preservatives or coloring
matters are found, and no Instances
of the occurrence of arsenic are on
record.
Concerning his analysis Chemist
Gibbs made the following statement:
Of the 100 samples analyzed those which
have been found to be sophisticated and adul
terated are, generally speaking-, obtained in
bulk by small dealers and bottled on their
premises. The condition of adulteration is al
most entirely of local origin and of a nature
readily corrected by the enforcement of the
law*.
Small quantities of arsenic have been found
in some French wines, but this Is the first
time thPt it has been detected in American
wines. There are a number of sources arising
from ignorant or careless handling of the wines
to which the origin of the arsenic might be
traced in vineyards, wineries or bottling places.
The names of the dealers in alleged
adulterated wines, together with the
brands and. name of the foreign -or
poisonous matter, were posted con
spicuously yesterday In the Health Of
fice.
SONS OF VETERANS
ELECT NEW OFFICERS
Division Encampment Ends Its La-
bors and Adjournment Is Fol
lowed by a Dinner.
The Sons of Veterans met in the
Division Encampment In the Red
Men's building yesterday and con
cluded its labors. The election for
officers resulted in the choice of the
following:
G. W. Conart of Los Angeles, di
vision commander; A. L. Longfellow
of Oakland, senior vice commander;
J. Cook of San Jose, junior vice com
mander; E. E. Gerring and W. E. Law
rence and C. Hagg. division councilors;
F. B. Wilson of this city, treasurer, and
E. J. Hromada and J. Cook, delegates
at large to represent the order at the
rational convention to be held at Get
tysburg.
The reports that were presented
show that there are fourteen camps
In the jurisdiction of the division,
and that during the past term one
camp was mustered in at Myrtle
Point, Or. There was but one death
in the order during the year. The
membership at this time is a little in
excess of 500. There were no changes
in the local laws, but several resolu
tions affecting the existing national
laws were adopted, and these will be
presented at the National Encamp
ment at Gettysburg.
The new officers were duly installed
by Commander in Chief Dusln, after
which the encampment adjourned for
one year.
In the evening there was a dinner
at the California Hotel to the national
commander. Senior Vice Commander
Geis and to the new and outgoing di
vision officers.
War Causes litigation.
The Russo-Japanese war has
plunged Rufus P. Jennings into liti
gation. Jennings had contracted to
deliver fifty tons of Japanese peanuts
to Medardo Garcia and Charles Mag
gini and twenty-five tons to L.. Sca
tena. He had just about half filled
his contracts when the war In the Ori
ent broke out and his agent In Japan
threw up his hands, said everything
had been blocked by the opening of
hostilities and not a peanut was to be
had. The result was that Jennings
was unable to fulfill his contracts. So
Maggini, as assignee of all the par
ties of the second part, filed suit
against him to recover $1996 50.
Judge Murasky heard evidence yes
terday as to the difficulties surround
ing the filling of orders in Japan
since the war broke out and will de
termine the merits of the case proba
bly to-day. _____^____
Onlooker Defeats Fate.
August Kaedlngf staked his life on
the drawing: of a straw yesterday and
attempted to commit suicide when fate
decided against him. He was observed
by C. W. Wilson of 793 Mission street,
who prevented the man from plung
ing into the bay at the ferry building.
Wilson saw Kaeding sorting long and
short straws arid curiosity led him to
keep watch. Kaeding was taken to
the detention ward, where the doctors
will pass upon his sanity.

SLOW TO FILE
BUDGET ITEMS
W r orks Board and Depart
ment of Electricity Neglect
to Comply With Charter
WILL PRUNE ESTIMATES
Supervisors Prepare to Cut
Down Requests for Allow
ances Exceeding Income
The Board of Works and the De
partment of Electricity are the only
two municipal bodies that have not
filed estimates of their expenditures
for the next fiscal year preliminary to
the adoption of the budget by the
Board of Supervisors.
The charter provides that such esti
mates shall be filed on or before the
first Monday in April, and the time
limit expired day before yesterday.
The estimate of the Board of Works
is generally a voluminous affair, cov
ering requests for three millions of
dollars, more or less, to conduct its
various departments.
The Supervisors' Finance Commit
tee will meet early next week to con
sider the requests of the various de
partments for their yearly appropria
tions. That there will be considerable
pruning done to many of the requests
Is certain. Already the departments
who have filed estimates have asked
the Suoervisors to allow them an
amount considerably in excess of $7,
600,000. Add to this the usual $3,000.
000 wanted by the Board of Works and
it means that the taxpayers will
be called upon to pay more than $10,
000,000 to pay the expense of the
city government. As the tax limit is
$1 per $100 on an assessed valuation,
which will approximate $520,000,000
this year, there will be but $5,200,000
raised by taxation. The revenue from
licenses and other sources will aggre
gate $1,880,000, making but $7,000,
000 to go around.
The Board of Education has aaked
for $1,843,000 in addition to the
$700,000 which will be received from
the State under the new apportion
ment law. It is highly probable that
the School Department will have to
content itself with $750,000 from the
city, making a total allowance of
$1,450,000. Last year the allowance
from State and city sources waa
$1,841,000.
It is said that the Supervisors aim
to approximate $1,000,000 for street
work and permanent improvements
and yet keep within the dollar limit of
taxation.
JAPANESE ARE SEEKING
TRADE OF PHILIPPINES
Steamship Line Between Panama and
Manila Is Proposed to Run
When War Closes.
The Manila. P. 1., correspondent of
the Pacific Commercial Museum in a
report just to hand refers to the In
roads made by the Japanese in the
trade of the Philippines and points
out a new menace to the trade of San
Francisco with the islands in the pro
posed new steamship service between
Panama and Manila, operated by the
Toyo Kisen Kaisha Company.
An account in a Manila paper of
the reported new service is In part as
follows:
l
According to advices from Japan the Toyo
Kisen Kaisha Company has large plans for
retaining Its share of the trans-Pacific trade
and is not inclined to retire from the field
In spite of the strong and close competition
which is promised. Besides putting on new
vessels the company intends to extend its
service to Panama, instituting what is to be
known as the Manila-Panama line. It is ex
pected that this line wili be opened shortly
alter the conclusion of the war.
Meanwhile the company is building two fast
and up-to-date steamers. They will be 12.000
tons and 20 knots. Only recently the com
pany concluded negotiations to obtatn a loan
from Rothschilds on the guarantee of the
Yokohama Specie Bank. According to this
loan contract the Toyo Kisen Kaisha will be
aliowed to obtain any amount of money up to
five million yen at 6 per cent interest per
annum, to be repaid within live or seven
years in installments. The new steamers will
be built In Japan, the necessary materials be
ing Imported from abroad two years being
required to build the vessels.
The museum's correspondent adds:
"You see, the Japs are looking to this
market and It will certainly be lost
to San Francisco completely if your
houses do not go* after the business
now. It Is here waiting for you and
you want to urge your people to get
after it before the new line from Pan
ama starts, for then the business will
be done by your Eastern houses."
Wants Cliff Rood Surveyed.
Park Commissioner Lloyd yester
day requested City Engineer Wood
ward to maka a new survey of the
Cliff House road, which the former
believes will result in giving much ad
ditional land to Golden Gate Park.
The present survey which forms part
of the official map of the city did not
follow the lines laid out by the or
dinance of the Board of Supervisors.
Instead of following along the beach
at right angles an elliptical line was
surveyed, which took away a consid
erable portion of the park. It is with
a view to getting this land back for
the city that the new survey will be
made.

Cure For The Blues
ONE MEDICINE THAT HAS MEYER FAILED
Health Folly Restored and the Joy of
Life Regained
When a cheerful, brave, light-hearted
woman is suddenly plunged into that
perfection of misery, the BLUES, it is
a sad picture. It is usually this way : I
She has been feeling " out of sorts'* '
for some time; head has ached and
j back also ; has slept poorly, been quite
j nervous, and nearly - fainted once or
; twice ; head dizzy, and heart-beats very
j fast ; then that bearing-down feeling.
and during- her menstrual period she is
exceedingly despondent. Nothing
pleases her. Her doctor says : " Cheer
| up : you have dyspepsia ; you will be
: all right soon."
But she doesn't get " all right, and
: hope vanishes; then come the brood*
1 ing, morbid, melancholy, everlasting
BLUES.
Don't wait until your sufferings have
j driven you to despair, with your nerves
I all shattered and your courage gone,
but take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound. See what it did for
Mrs. Rosa Adams, of 819 13th Street,
! Louisville, Ky., niece of the late Gen-
eral Roger Hanson, C.B. A. She writes:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â "
" I cannot tell you with pen and Ink what
' Lydia E. | Pinkham's Vegetable Compound

troubles, extreme lassitude, ' the blues,'

advised to try Lydia Â£. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, and it not only cured my female

health and strength. The buoyancy of my

Although Outbatted,

OAKLAND. April 4. â Rubs Hall's
Slwashes were scalped by Clay Haw
backer's Commuters in the baseball
melee on the Idora Park reservation
yesterday afternoon; score, 7 to 4.
Chief Hall's tribesmen were savage
â with the big- club and mauled out
twelve hits, while the pummeling of
the locals netted them but seven sin
gles.
Miller, watchman of the right lawn
for the Siwashes and the man for
whom Seattle offered Van Haltren
and Delehanty in exchange, sparkled
in the game. Three times he parad
ed to bat and three times he soaked
the sphere safely. Two of his trio of
wallops were triphammer three-bag
gers to the far right corner of the ln
closure. Miller also scored three of
the four rune credited to the northern
visitors and took correct care of the
only chance he had in the field.
Both teams worked southwing
pitchers. Shields twisted for Seattle,
and Graham twirled for Oakland.
With the exception of the eighth In
ning, when the Siwashes batted him
for four bingles. Graham kept the
hits off him scattered. McMurray re
ceived Oscar's delivery in place of
Jimmy Byrnes, who was unable to
don the mask because of illness.
Two runs were gathered by the
Commuters in the first inning and five
in the sixth period. Seattle tallied
once in the fourth and twice In the
eighth frame. Miller slugged for
three bags in this spasm and regis
tered when Frary duplicated the ;
smash. Frary came home on a sin
gle by Captain Hall. Score: :

STANFORD MEN WRATHY
AT BERKELEY'S TRAIXER
Indignation Aroused by Christie's
Statement That Lanagan Is Not
Â£J%ible.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 4.
ford students are greatly excited
and highly indignant over the state
ment made by Walter Christie, the
University of California athletic
trainer, to the effect that Harry Lana
gan, the crack cardinal hurdler, was
-not a bona-nde member of the uni
versity, but that he was merely at
tending college for the sake of com
peting in athletics. Christie bases
his claims on the fact that Lanagan
registered on the last possible date
and then was absent from the uni
versity for a short time afterward. The
California trainer also alleges he has
more than a suspicion that Lanagan
:8 being paid by the Stanford stu-
dents. It Is this last statement that
has caused such fury at Stanford.
Athletics at Stanford, they maintain,
are far above such methods, and they
have the facts to back up their
opinions.
Not the least indignant is Lanagan
himself. "All the facts In my case,"
he said in an interview this afternoon,
'are known to the athletic commit
tee* of both universities and the fac
ulty of both have declared me eligible.
In view of thto fact I feel that any
protest should come from the athletic
committees of the University of Cali
fornia and not from Trainer Chris
tie."
Prlw* for Do* Show.
H. H. Carlton. manager of the com-

SAN FRANCISCO STILL IN THE LEAD
Portland Nine Looks
Like High Art
Collection.
Fans Witness a Game
Which Stirs Up
Excitement.
JudÂ«;#. McCreedie's Portlanders trot
ted out on the green at the Eighth-
Ptreet lot yesterday for the first time
this season and after the fans had seen
them tear off a few spasms of fast
ball thÂ«y all agreed that Portland has
collected a real baseball nine at last.
They were beaten, but crnly after ten
Innings of fighting. Score â San Fran
cisco 1, Portland 0.
It was a game that any fan would
have been proud to look upon. There
wag not a slow moment in the mix-up.
Errors were almost unheard of, while
the fielders on both sides kept busy
throughout in smothering base hits and
cutting off runs.
Unless something happens to de
moralize the team Portland will Burely
flgurt this pt-ason. The team is well
balanced, fast and full of ginger. The
outfielders are all cracking good hit
ters and some ot the infielders and the
pitchers can slug the ball a bit as well
as Jumbo McLean, the largest catcher
who ever appeared at Recreation Park.
Many old familiar faces are seen Â©n
the Portland make-up. For instance,
there are McCreedie, Househoulder and
Van Buren in the outfield and Larry
Schlafley and Runkle in the infield.
Jake Atz, the shortstop, is one of those
whirlwind kids who plays ball some
thing like Buck Francks. Clark at first
is a lefthander, who had a tryout in
the big league once. He originally
came from Santa Cruz.
San Francisco was there all the time
and Georgie v^heeler brought home
victory in the tenth inning with a time
ly slap to right field. Gochnauer had
opened up the round with a drive to
center and Wilson's out advanced him.
Wheeler then swung throtfgh with his
little drive and broke up the game with
but one man out. The finish set the
fans wild, for it was the flrst good
one they had feasted their eyes on this
year.
Eflslck, the Portland twirler, pitches
like a man who knows how to star in
the box. He had everything yesterday
and did not allow ac many hits as
Wheeler. In fact both pitchers were
on their mettle and they tossed up an
article of baJl good enough for any
leagrje.
Atz got away with - low drive from
Wilson's bat in the seventh round,
completing a play that was nigh im
possible. He speared the leather with
one mitt a foot from the ground.
Schlafley'a work at second was great
to gaze upon. He cut off at least three
safe hits and handled his nine chances
without a slip. The score:

FAIR ATHLETES
ACCUSE MERZ
A warrant on a swindling charge
may be sworn out for the arrest of the
debonair athletic instructor, Charles
Here, who was formerly employed by
the San Francisco Women's Athletic
Association. The president and secre
tary of the organization have in their
possession positive proof that he did
some very shady bookkeeping for them.
In addition they have a signed admis
sion of shortages for which he was re
sponsible.
The admission reads as follows:
"I hereby promise to make good the
shortages in my accounts for the bene
fit entertainment given to the San
Francisco Women's Athletic Associa
tion on March 14, 1905, as soon as It is
In mv power to do so. Charles Merz."
The indignation of the women was
re-aroused against Merz when they
learned that he was attempting to start
a rival organization. Some of their
members had been asked to desert to
the new club.
The directors are in a state of true
feminine uncertainty as to what to do
about it. While they have complete
evidence against Merz they do not like
the Idea of mingling with the flotsam
of the Police Court. All they desire is
that Merz shall leave them in peace
with their dumb bells and Indian clubs.
"We don't want him to go about re
flecting discredit upon our organiza
tion and we would not like to see him
impose upon other people," explained
Dr. Mary Alton, president of the ath
letic association. "We want him to
leave town. I can have him arrested
any time and may do so, though I dis
like to go into the courts."
Merz's shortages amounted to several
hundred dollars, part of which has been
made good. Besides juggling the benefit'
funds Merz failed to make good on
promises made to the organization. He
contracted to supply talent for the en
tertainment, but at the last minute
when the tickets were sold it was found
that he had failed to make any at
tempt to do bo. The women themselves
by entreaties secured the assistance of
a corps of entertainers.
Another reason why the women de
clare Merz a "mean thing" is an alle
gation that he "jumped" his board bill.
While employed by the association he
boarded with one of the members. At
the end of the month he thanked his
landlady politely and departed without
settling his accounts, it is claimed.
Though the club was nearly ruined
at the start by bad management it is
now in a prosperous condition. Last
night the gymnasium was crowded
with laughing young women and girls
who were doing stunts under/the direc
tion of Professor George Miehling, who
succeeded the debonair Merz. There
were 160 In attendance, which is a fair
average, according to Dr. Alton.
TRAINER TUCKER ACCEPTS
THE DEFI OF WILLIAMS
Ram's Horn and Agile Will Probably
Meet Soon In a Match
Race.
MEMPHIS, April 4. â Captain
James Williams' announcement that
he is willing to match Ram's Horn
against Agile for $5000 a side re
ceived a ready response from "Bob"
Tucker, trainer for Captain Brown.
Tucker informed Secretary McFar
lane to-day of his willingness to run
Agile on the following terms:
The race to be run on a date be
tween April 12 and 15 at one mile and
a furlong, both colts to carry 122
pounds. Tucker also insists on a side
bet of $5000, or as much more as Wil
liams desires to wager. Williams is
to give his final answer to-morrow.
Racing Days Reduced.
ST. LOUIS. April 4. â Owing to the
passage by the Legislature of the law
repealing the statute which permitted
betting at racetracks the number of
racing days here has been reduced by
the management of the Kinloch, Del

HEFOrUIiIiER SAYS HE
IS STILIi AN AMATEURI
Blue and Gold Pitcher Denies Rumor
That He Played Under As
sumed Name.
BERKELEY. April 4.â "Heinle"
Heitmuller, captain and pitcher of the
varsity baseball team , who played
yesterday at Fresno with the Heese
man team against the Fresno aggre
gation, denies the report that he used
an assumed name in the game and
that he received any money for his
services. He declares the Heesemans
do not pay for the work of men on
the team and his standing as an ama
teur is as good now as it ever has
been.
Colonel Edwards, chairman of the
laculty committee on athletics, dis
cussed with Heitmuller the report
from Fresno to-day, preparatory to
bringing the matter before the exec
utive committee of the Associated
Students to-night. Heitmuller reit
erated his denials to Colonel Edwards.
"I played first base for the Heese
mans," said Heitmuller, "simply for
the practice and sport of the trip. I
cannot be accused of having broken
into the professional ranks. I received
no money and used my own name."
The possibility of Stanford's ob
jecting to Heitmuller officiating as
twirler for California in the intercol
legiate game next Saturday does not
distress Trainer Walter Christie at all.
He believes that in Newman the var
sity nine has a Ditcher fully capable
of taking Heitmuller's place should
the big pitcher be disqualified.
Colonel Edwards Informed the com
mittee to-night that he had conferred
with Heitmuller regarding the reports,
and that he was satisfied with the lat
ter's explanation. Colonel Edwards
said no action by the committee is
necessary in the matter.

St. George Jr. Defeats Speedy-
Ones in the Handicap.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
St. George Jr. might be afflicted with
a stray corn, a tendon or two may be
bowed and all that, but nobody will
dispute the fact that he is a very rapid
traveler. The black horse with Wright
in the saddle and 5^3 to 1 in the ring,
tried conclusions with five other flyers
in the '"Futurity course handicap at
Oakland yesterday, and he made good
dogs of them ail. He waa rated be
hind Sad Sam and Misty's Pride to the
stretch and then when let down, scam
pered in a handy winner over Princess
Titania, a late comer, in 1:09%. Misty'a
Pride, equal favorite with Sad Sam.
ran a superb race, though failing to
concede the weight asked.
With, reinforcements from Lob An
geles and this city ; the latter due to
poolroom difficulties, the attendance
was large. Four favorites were laid
low and the books enjoyed a profitable
session.
Trainer Tommy Lottridge sent a filly
named Paladia to the post in the 2
year-old dash, and his instructions to
Charley Bell were "to try to teach
her something." She was only a green
country lass all right, but she knew
enough the beat the favorite, Spinosa,
three wide open lengths at odds of 30
to 1. After a seminary course Paladia
may become a star performer. Splnosa
received good handling from Birken
ruth, finishing ahead of thirteen others.
First Lake ran third.
The Miller stable furnished the favor
ite for the six and a half furlong selling
race in Sincerity Belle. McÃride let the
filly fall so far out of it at the start
that she nearly bumped into a San

NEW YORK, April 4. â A trim
steam yacht, the Orienta, built on the
lines of a torpedo boat and represent
ing the navy of the Panama Republic,
is anchored at a shipyard in Elizabeth
port, N. J., prepared to sail for Colon
on April 15. The yacht Is well equip
ped with rapid-flre guns, searchlights
and wireless telegraph. In command
of Captain Lovelace, formerly of Kan
sas City, she will make a business of
running down smugglers and keeping
order among the Indians along the
eastern shores of the isthmuÂ»
Pablo avenue car. and of course did not
participate In any of the happenings
at the finish. Bailey, a recent arrival
from Ascot Park, ridden by Otis and
10 to 1. drifted in nearly a length be
fore ESrodun, another outsider. Sun
Rose cut out the pace for five and a
half furlongs and then blew up.
Royal White, a 10 to 1 shot, took the
third, a Futurity course run. with the
weights raised twelve pounds above the
scale. He was well handled by Dugan,
and won easily from Waterspout and
F. E. Shaw.
Played down to 3 to 2 favoritism Sou
friere made short work of her com
pany in the mile selling event. Miller
permitted My Order and Hulford to go
out and race each other to a standstill
and then, shaking up the first choice,
she breezed in flrst. Hulford lasted long
enough to take the place from Gate
way.
Garnet Ferguson's Military Man, a 1
to 2 chance, won the concluding mile
run. He had Wright In the saddle and
defeated the pacemaker. Ralph Young,
with a trifle of urging toward the close.
Show honors fell to Forest King.
TRACK NOTES.
Wright piloted two winners.
Dell Fountain purchased Laura F
M from Johnny Mellin yesterday.
Garnet Ferguson said yesterday
that Bearcatcher would not be a
starter at Oakland. The great brown
horse has entirely recovered from his
illness and his wind shows no signs of
being affected, but of late his feet
have bothered him some. Garnet will
now reserve him for tha New York
campaign. â¢

Mine Inspector. Who Proved
a Hero, Among the Victims
at the Leiter Diggings
REMOVING THE BODIES
Thirty-Seven Already Taken,

31 any More Are in the Shaft
CARBONDALE, 111., April 4.âThirty
seven bodies of miners, who lost their
lives in the gas explosion at the mine

Seventh district, who lost his life while
attempting to reach and rescue those
who were entombed. He was one of tbe
best-known miners of the district. He
leaves four children, and was a mem
ber of the Masonic order.
After thirty hours but little light is
shed on the cause of the catastrophe.
The accident is attributed to carbonic
acid gas. due to poor ventilation.
Every body so far recovered is a black
ened mass. Joseph Leiter arrived at the
shaft to-day. The Coroner's Jury im
paneled to Inquire into the cause of the
disaster has so far rendered no ver
dict. The taking of evidence may be
prolonged several days.

at the Forest, Fish and
Game Show at Pavilion
EXHIBIT FOR CHARITY
Biff Crowd Takes Pleasure
in Viewing Attractions.
Doors to Be Open Sunday
It would have taken a traveler from
Scotland to tell the difference between
the exhibit of the Pacific Coast Forest.
Fish and Game Association last night
at the Mechanics' Pavilion, and the
land of the bagpipe and the oat cakes.
The Scots, in native garb, were there.
There were Scotch Â«ongs, dances and
athletics.
The huge hall was filled to its ut
most with an Interested crowd of spec
tators. The programme, elaborate in
its many details, was hardly less pleas
ing than the wonders of fish, forest and
animal life shown.
On account of the demand for ad
mission to the pavilion on Sundays the
association will alter its intention to
keep the doors closed on the Sabbath.
So that the workingman can ace the
exhibition the show will be open next
Sunday. A visit to the pavilion will
be the same as a stroll in the park. A
musical programme will be arranged
and a good time is assured.
To-night will be Oriental night. Jiu
jitsu and other sports of the Orient will
be demonstrated. Following is the
programme:
Musical programme, afternoon â Dr. H. J.
Stewart, director. Overture. "Rosamunde"

That a stomach is a superfluity to
a man is apparently proved by th* 1 <ase
of Max Sigl, Seymour. Wis.. whu has
been without a stomach for a jrmr and

Sigl was operated on hy Vr. A. H.
Livings of this city a year ago. and
on Thursday the doctor opened up thy?
abdominal cavity and found that S
condition was perfectly satisfactory
The entire stomach was r "t renn
hut only about three-fourths of it.
There was a sarcor: <
which made the operation necessary to
save the patient's lire.
Mr. Slgl d^s not pay any more at
tention to his diet than >ther men.
He eats whatever he fancies, a
does not have any trouble with b
gestion. The intestines have assumed
the work of th^ stomach and th
is digested in the intestines.
Dr. Levings exnressed the opinion
that so far as the rtis^a.^ v hich orig

years.
A peculiar feature in r
case is thÂ« fact that Jo*epb 9hfi< *

Tbe weekly report oi A. Q. McAxUe, seotlon
director of the climate and crop service of the
tvÂ«a.ther Bureau, It as follows:
â ;47;; 4 7; GENERAL SUMMARY.
Â£h jwtrs were BnajMÃt In ail aeotions during
the ci-J6.r.c dajra of the month, with hear/
teini&il In some places, accompanied by high
â Â»iDds. - The snowfall In the mountains was
about as â¢â¢-->>' as at any time during the sea
eon, trnow also fell in San Bernardino, lied
l&TiCs. Hiverside and other places in Southern
California. Severe froets occurred 00 the 30th
cxd 31rt in nearly all parts of the State. -
Farm work was retarded by the unfavorable
ecnditions and crops made rather slow growth.
Grain is generally in very good condition,
though there are tome reports of Its turning
yellow on account of the continued rains Â«"<<
thoroughly saturated soil. The outlook, how
ever, lÂ£ gtxxi fcr large crops of wheat, oats
ana barley. Alfalfa and barley hay cutting
are in progress in the south, where the crops
ere quite heavy. Hops are in excellent condi
tion and showing considerable growth. There
Is an abundance of green teed in all sections
ar.-i eiock are in prime condition.
Reports Indicate that some damage was
tore- by the frost* to grapes and deciduous
Jruits, especially In UiÂ« Saa Joaniuin Valley.
'..~i no reliable estimates have yet been re
ceived. In the Sacramento and Santa. Clara
valleys it is claimed that most of the decidu
ous fruits were too far advanced to be serious
ly injured. Sour tap. shothole fungus and too
much rain, it ie reported, axe causing much
damage to peach trees.
â¢ SACRAMENTO V ALLEY.â CooI weather
prex-ailed most of the week and severe frosts
eccurred in many places toward the close.
Heavy rain fell in the northern districts on
Tuesflay and Wednesday, accompanied by high
minds. Tbe snowfall in the mountains was un
csua!!y heavy and. extended well down to the!
valley. Grain continues In rood condition, but
lbs) soil Ie too wet for healthy growth and in
t r~.'- places the grain is turning yellow. Hops
fcave ' wintered very well and are showing con-.
riderable growth, - Alfalfa., and pasturage are
rrowing rapidly. .The -heavy ,- Greets- probably
caused som* slight damag* to deciduous fruits
acd grrapes In low places along the rivers, :
though reports ftate that most of the fruit )
v as too far advanced v* be seriously injured. 1
Cherr!'*. apricots and almonds are reported

COAET AND BAY SECTIONS.â weath- i
er was cloudy and unsettled at the beginning >
of the week, with heavy rains and hail in ;
it any places and snow in the mountains. High
winds prevailed In the central and northern
sections on Tuesday and Wednesday. Severe
frosts occurred Thursday and Friday mornings.
but reports all agree that no material damage .
resulted to fruit and grapes except In a few
places. Walnuts at Peachland were quite se
rlouEly injured. Deciduous fruits are advanc-
Ing quite rapidly and give promise of large i
crops. Vineyards are thrifty and progressing ;
satisfactorily. Grain and gre&e continue in,
gt>od <-ondlt!on. but growth lias "been rather j
clow during the week and more sunshine is ;
s)ecor Green feed Is plentiful.
SAX JOAQUIN VALLEY.â PartIy cloudy i
weather with showers prevailed the first part
Â«f thÂ«- w**k and clear, cold weather the latter.
X;' ':: sr froÂ»t on the rnornSng of- the 31st did
oor<sider&b!*> damage to some varieties of
grapes in the Fresno district, while In other
sections the damage is reported as light. Lit
tie or no daznaxe to other fruits. Plowing and
cultivating orchards and vineyard* are progress
ing rapidly. Grain and grass are making rapid
growth Â«nd promise good crops. Heavy snow
. fell in the high Sierras during the late norm.
(-â  - r , are h^sfthy and in excellent condition.
The <*ol<l weather of the 30th and 81et Is re
ported to hare killed the apricots and greatly
Injured other fruits in Owens Valley.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â Fair weather
et the beginning of the week was followed by
V.rtt rain Wednesday and Thursday, with phe- j
nomenal enowvtnrms at Redlands, Riverside,
Can Bernardino and other places. High -winds i
'prevailed in some sections end odd. frosty
wÂ«>athÂ»r followed the rain. Minimum temper
aturt-s of E2 degrees were recorded on the 31st
st many toes, and the frosts probably in
jured deciduous fruits and tender plants to
some Â»xt*nt. Citrus fruits were not damaged.
Orasff â¢!-Â«â¢Â»Â» now In bloeacm are also bearing
yoarig orarijre* and ripe ones. Harvest Is In
, progr^Fs on alfalfa and barley hay In Riverside
County, and the yield Is reported heavy. Grain
Is making good growth and green feed Is
-aVjr.i'RTt. All '--jit trÂ»es are looking well.
The observer at San Diego reports that the
reservoirs at Otay, Sweetwater. Cuyamaca. La.
Vesa and Escondldo contain orer ten billion
gallons â the greatest amount of water ever
Impounded In the county.
EUREKA SUMMARY. â Peas and late pota
toes ere being planted. Large acreage In oats,
crop thÂ» heaviest In many years. Grass,
grain, crops of all kinds were never In better
condition and promise record breaking yields.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.â The week was
Â©old with some iron. Rain on the 2THh, turn
tr.g to snow or hall for a short time in some
u'linâ but no 4ant|Â« is reported. Crops are
in good condition except some rast In oats

Jfew York Stock Market.
' - YEW YORK. April â The complexion of
to-day's stock market was decidedly mixed.
An ainueually large cumber ol separate . Issues
vere dealt in notwithstanding the smaller ag
gregate of the transactions. Many usually
neglected specialties and industrials were dealt
In though the principal gains and losses were
found under tbls classification. Railroad
stocks were slucclah throughout and for the
moat Part were heavy. The decline In the
* stock market seemed to be In part due to the
Unsettling influence of the erratic fluctuations
In Tennessee Coal. Prices of that stock were
tip and down all day and operators In the roar
â¢ )crt were at a loss to determine whether the
terns of the proposed merger or the distress
cf an uncovered short interest was responsible
for the wavering < motion of the stock. The
. passage through one bouse - of the New York
Legislature of the stock-transfer tax and the
belief that its enactment into law was oer
tain had some revived influence In the uncer
. tain mood of the speculation. The inquis
* ItoriaJ tendency of the legislation â  and public
â alley toward corporations and the prevalence
Â«f investigations Into their affaire came in for
ton? lderation an^ an impression of a threat
to values of securities. The embittered con
/ trcversy which has sprung up in the admin
istration' of the Equitable life Assurance So
ciety and the investigation thus prompted has
th* effect, of âºmpha-lzlng this Impression. The
. â¢try" prominence of the low-grade industrial
â¢ *tecks. even where . they . give evidence â¢of
1 strength is regarded as an evidence that the
i higher grade stocks have exhausted their re
bourcee for advance and . beget* suspicion of
the stability of the whole market, â¢ '
Some of the day's abortive movements in the
better class of stocks were suspected of being
manipulative and designed to offset this char- |
acteristic of the market. The absence of long
expected announcements, which have been sup- â â 
posed simply to await the conclusion of the
Northern Securities case. Induces a feeling of ;
suspense and distrust over the extent to which i
mysterious allusions and rumors have been
allowed to influence great speculative move
ments In various stork*. There is a feeling
that some of these mysteries must either be :
dissolved soon or be replaced by effective new
factors if prices are to be sustained at their
present high level. The tone of the money
market shows gome relaxation In consequence
of the completion of the April settlement, but
not to the extent that sanguine speculator*
hoped, and the possibility is now faced of a
considerable prolongation of higher rates of
interest. It Is evident that, many . important
capital lstues have been planned to take ad
vantage of the normal accumulation of re
i serves at this time of the year, both here
and abroad, and this class of requirements
I will, of course, take precedence of stock mar
ket borrowing. The most substantial sustain
ing Influence in to-day's market was the heavy
accumulation of United States Steel stocks.
Reported large buying of pigriron by that cor
poration is a repetition of previous conditions
but the lack of response in the securities of
the company has been the cause â of dissatis
faction in the market. The rise in the South
ern railroad group was attributed to the en
larged cotton, movement and to the advantages
to accrue from a rising scale Of freights on
iron due to a. sliding adjustment in harmony
with iron prices. London was a seller of
stocks In this market to An extent sufficient
to harden the rate for exchange by reason of
the demand for remittances In payment. There
was sustained strength In a few of the in
dustrials but the persistent heaviness of the
railroads' made -the closing irregular.
Bonde were irregular. Total sales, par
value $4,810,000.
Vnlted States bonds were all unchanged on
call. :

"HUMAN CRAB."
Vagrant Whose Sloth fulness
Astonishes Policemen.
He Wallows in Sand at Ocean Beach and Is
Too Lazy to Walk Upright.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Af an exemplar of human inertia
James Bunnig;:n alias "The Human
' excited the wonder while he
esrr.ed the contempt of Patrolmen
Dow She*. How any j
â¢ ould be lazy as he and live was more
â -c and intelligent of
â l understand. Until he im-
as a public eyesore they
led him as a freak of na
r-nd when duty dictated his arrest
he was to be pitied as
%
well as scorned. For surely, they rea
soned." no man could be mentally
found and possessed of such an aver
â¢ fion to anything even remotely sug- J
g-estive of physical effort.
Mr. Dunnigan's habitat was the j
ocean beach, where he acquired his ]
sobriquet of "The Human Crab" by j
a penchant for wallowing in the sand j
and slowly crawling: upon all fours, i
like an infant that has not attained !
.ability to walk upright. He basked j
amid the dunes and was awake only ]
at such times as hunger impelled him
to forage, which he did by creeping
to favorite camping places and pick
ing up such food scraps as were left
by picnickers. When those sources of
supply failed him he groaning!*" ac
co?ted passers-by for alms, and it was
his wont to painfully wiggle to where
women were seated inhaling the ozone
and to startle them by begging for a
portion of the luncheon which he sus-
Ipected them of having. For thus
frightening a couple of feminine neu
rotics he was arrested. Â»
As he stood before Judge Mogan
the external make-up of Mr. Dunni
gan did not belie the accusation of
vagrancy entered against his name on
the calendar. Stalwart, ragged and
unwashed, he was a fair type of the
conventional stage tramp. His knees
protruded like those of a veteran
workhorse and their baggy covering
was patched and sand-soiled. He
yawned drowsily and looked around
as If in pearch of something to lean
' against, but the bailiffs made him
stand erect while he faced the bench. ;
He expressed inability to account
for his phenomenal slothfulness. It
had gradually taken possession of
him. he said, for he remembered a i
time when he would Just as lief walk \
.as crawl and was content with eight
hours' slumber per diem. That was
in South Bend, Ind., and the change
Â« South Bend. Ir.d., and the change
Hfl climate might have had something
to do with his deprivation of energy.
" No, 'he had never been of feeble con- '
stitution. Indeed, at present he felt
quite robust, but the mere thought of
engaging in toll, however light, rather
sickened him. Would he promise to
seek' employment if he were liberat
ed? X" he would not; for he was
certain that no such promise could be
kept by him. He might be lazy, but
he was no liar. True, endeavor to
make him labor might be undertaken
by his custodians in jail, but he was
inclined to think they would soon
grow tired of such effort and abandon
it as futile. Was he not ashamed of
himself? No, he could not truthfully
say he was. He believed Providence
intends some men for work and some
men for play, and that he was one of
the latter â a natural drone without a
natural provider. He didn't care how
long his term of imprisonment might
be made. "
"I'll have to think it over," said the
Judge. .
"De fack am. Jedge." said Miss Lot

The object of Miss GonzaJes' hope

was the recognized Adonis of that ele

three and Rufe to five months' im
prisonment. Lottie's term expired a
few days ago. and it was her persist

led to her arrest and arraignment be

"Ah doan keer," she said, "wat yer

that Tom showed ability to whip as

John F. Johnson of Scandinavian na
tivity confessed to Judge Mogan that
he had stolen eleven red lights placed
as danger signals where streets were
undergoing repair.
"Did you intend to establish -a red

"Ah, but after putting them out you

CHECKER GETS
LONG SENTENCE
Twenty-Five Years in Prison
3leted Out by Judge Cook
for Youthful Murderer
LECTUBE BY THE COUKT
Typical Exemplification of
End of Young Men Who
Seek Evil Companionship
J Alan Goucher, \ convicted at murder
j in the second degree for the killing
lof Policeman Eugene C. Robinson .at
; Sixteenth and Valencia streets on Jan
j vary 21, 1302, was sentenced by .Judge
Cook yesterday *-> serve twenty-five
years in San Quentin. Only his youth
saved him from imprisonment for life.
His father, ex-State Senator George G.
, Goucher, made a strong plea for mercy
;on that ground. . . ; 5
, When the case was called the defend
ant's father made a motion for a new
; trial, which was denied. He then mode
his plea for mercy. He said his son
was only 18 years of age at the time
of the murder. He was easily led and
had erred through his evil associations
with men much older than himself and
â¢ experienced in crime. As far as he
! could trace back there never was a
criminal in the families of his par
ents and the boy was not a criminal
by heredity. For the sake of the boy's
mother and his sisters and brothers
Senator Goucher begged for the mercy
I of the court.
I District Attorney Byington said in
f reply that a man or boy who went out
| at night with a loaded revolver in his
pocket to hold up people had murder
in his heart. He could not feel sym
j pathy for the defendant, who had fired
' bullets into the body of the dying po
liceman. .
( The Judge ordered the defendant to
stand up and in a deliberate and im
pressive manner said in part:
; Your present position well illustrates .to
you and to the world that which was un
doubtedly taught to you when a child by your
devoted mother. â¢
I doubt not that you can recall the words,
heard by you in your youth, that "evil com
; munications .corrupt gnod manners."
| By your failure to heed those words you
'â  eland here to-day, pointed at by your fellow
I men. a pitiful example of the result of evil
I companionship."
"Were you of equal age and experience with
your companions in crime I should : feel In
consequence of the evidence adduced against
. you for although you | did not fire the fatal
shot you used your, pistol â that a proper sen
â  tence to be . imposed would be about forty
i years.
j ' Your prattling little brothers must, through
' life, bear the burden .of relationship to - a
felon: your loving sister must forever recall
. to her memory the scenes of the heartrending
. trial which your acts compelled her to wlt-
I ness; a fond father, who has done ail that
: a father could to protect his flesh and blood
, ir m the penalties of the- law : and whose
i efforts in your behalf have saved you from
i Â»!->-.r!nÂ£r the fate of your companion. Woods,
) must suffer untold anguish for your crime,
) an.l last, but not least, you see a devoted
â¢ mother with bleeding heart, suffer far more
j for her '. first born than she would have suf
; fered had God taken him from her while an
. infant in her arms and while still as innocent
'as on the day she gave him birth, j .
Such, however, are the consequences of
; crime and the result of. evil companionship.
The defendant listened to, the words
i of the Judge without the slightest sign
,of emotion and when jhe sat down a
faint smile spread over his face. His
; father asked for arid was granted a
stay of execution of ten days.

O'Farrell streets. For the enlighten
ment of Judge Conlan it was explained
that Mr. Davidson's pseudonym was
earned by his practice of keeping a nose
bag attached to his horse's head and
thus providing a plausible excuse for
his breach of the ordinance which pro
vides that peddler's vehicles shall be
kept constantly moving. When over
hauled by a policeman he would claim
that he could not feed his horaj utui
keep its legs in action at the same
time, but when the nosebag was exam
ined by Officer Hutchings he found that
it contained no feed. Mr. Davidson will
be sentenced to-day.
James B. Wymau, a barber at Six
teenth and Market streets, was given
four months' imprisonment for having
threatened to Fhcot his mother, who
testified falsely before Judge Mogan in
an effort to rave her unnatural off
spring from punishment.
Mrs. Annie Comte, wife of Osmond,
shrieked dismally when Judge Conlan
committed her and her husband to
stand trial in the Superior Court on a
grand larceny charge.
Mrs. William Tucker requested Judge
Mogan to order her husband, a ped
dler, to contribute to the support of
herself and their two children the sum
of $10 a week, and also to compel Wil
liam to cease visiting his family or in
terfering with it in any way other than
that of providing for its maintenance.
"In other words," remarked his
Honor, "when he has no money you
don-'t want him to come around?"
"That's it exacUy," said Mrs. Tucker.
It developed, however, that Mr.
Tucker's average weekly income is $12,
so the Judge said it would be unfair to
allow him only $2 a week, and suggest
ed that Mrs. Tucker reduce her claim
to $6. or an equal division of the bread
winner's earnings. After some demur
Mrs. Tucker consented to the reduction,
but receded not at all from her original
demand that Mr. Tucker be prohibited
"pestering" her or the children when
they have no pecuniary reason for re
ceiving him. It was so ordered.
HAS THRILLING
FIGHI FOR LIFE
Sailor on Collier Edith Faces
Death in Locker With
Runaway Anchor Chain
HIS ESCAPE A MIRACLE
Conrad Sunberg Is Torn and
Mangled by Steel Monster
as It Uncoils Beneath Him
i
Conrad Sunberg, a sailor on the
steamer Edith, battled for his life on
; Monday night with a writhing, rattling
serpent of steel in the dark and narrow
j confines of the collier's chain locker. !
. The fight lasted but a brief half min
[ ute. Before it was over Sunberg had
j lost consciousness and how he escaped
; being torn to pieces is hard to under- j
stand. He is now lying on a cot at the j
Marine Hospital, torn and mangled, I
| aching in every limb and still dazed
from his awful experience.
The Edith reached port early yester
day morning. Expecting to anchor in j
the harbor until daylight. Captain Hall
â rave orders Monday evening to have I
the anchor chain overhauled. As the ;
twists and snarls were straightened the !
chain was run out through the hawse
hole, the bight hanging in the water. !
W hen all was clear Sunberg was sent j
into the chain locker, a deep, narrow, |
boxlike compartment, to coil the chain |
as the windlass pulled it in. Link by
link the big chain clattered into the |
locker, Sunberg guiding the steel ser- i
pent into shipshape coils and getting i
nearer and nearer to the top of the box
as the chain filled the locker.
Suddenly the messenger chain con
necting windlass and winch parted.
With nothing to restrain it the chain ;
began to pay out with a velocity which j
increased with every link that passed i
through the hawse pipe. The greater I
the velocity the more terrible became i
the plight of the sailor, hemmed in the
chain locker, on the top of that writh
ing mass of runaway chain.
The chain started to pay out with a
jerk, and Sunberg was thrown into the
air to fall back on the mass of moving {
metal. He was dragged to the hawse I
hole, but by frantic effort saved him- |
self from being jammed in the pipe, j
Those on deck realized Sunberg's plight, j
but could do nothing to check the rush
of steel. When they reached the chain
locker all was quiet. The light of a
lantern showed Sunberg lying at the
bottom, limp and unconscious, his
clothes torn to rags, his flesh bruised
and bleeding.
Tenderly he was lifted on deck, where i
rough sailors played the nurse so well 'â¢
that before daylight yesterday morning '
Sunberg had recovered consciousness, j
At the Harbor Hospital it was found j
that no bones were broken, but there j
was hardly an unbruised spot on the !
sailor's body. He is young and strong,
and the doctors say he will recover. He
was moved later to the Marine Hospi
tal, where he will be cared for until the
effects of the shock wear off.
BENSON GIVES TESTIMONY
REGARDING REDDY LANDS
Speculator of Lieu Lands Fame Is a
Witness Before Probate Judge
Coffey.
John A. Benson of lieu lands fame
was a witness in Judge Coffey's court
yesterday on behalf of Thomas B.
Walker, who is protesting against the
petition for the sale of what are
known as the Monache lands, situated
in Inyo and Tulare counties and be
longing to the estate of the late Pat
rick Reddy.
In his protest Walker sets forth
that he has already paid to Benson
$7105 for 1960 acres of the lands,
Reddy's estate owning a one-half in
terest in 9500 acres. Benson was as
signed title to the lands, which were
contained within the boundaries of
the Sierra forest reserve, by Emily M.
Reddy and Edward A. Reddy, sister
and brother of the deceased and heirs
to his estate, for the purpose of re
conveying the same to the Govern
ment for the selections of lands out
side of a forest reserve in lieu thereof.
Walker's contention that he has
paid the $7105 was corroborated by
Benson yesterday, as were the claims
of others that they have acquired an
interest in the lands. The sale of the
lands is asked that certain debts of
the Reddy estate may be met. Judge
Cofley will continue the hearing to
day.
DR. JOSLEX CHARGED WITH
MURDER OF MRS. LUCEY
He Tries to Shift the Crime Upon the
Shoulders of Dr. Meadows,
Alias Weston.
A Coroner's jury yesterday re
turned a verdict accusing Dr. Otto C.
Joslen, alias "Dr. White," of the mur
der of Mrs. Frances Lucey oÂ£ 704
Washington street, by performing a
criminal operation.
Mrs. Lucey died last Friday night at
the Pacific Hospital. She made a
statement to the physicians and to her
mother and sister that she had been
the victim of a criminal operation per
formed by Dr. Joslen last December.
Dr. Joslen testified that he conduct
ed ;i doctor's and dentist's office at 702
Market street, and that to his male
patients he was known as Dr. White,
while his female patients knew him
as Dr. Joslen. He swore that when
Mrs. Lucey came to him last Decem
ber for treatment she told him that
she was suffering from the effects of
a surgical operation performed by
Dr. L. H. Meadows. He testified fur
ther that he gave her some palliative
and antiseptic medicines, none other.
Dr. Meadows admitted that he had
been doing business at 305 Kearny
street, advertising under the names of
Dr. Weston & Co., and "Dr. West, the
Old Reliable," both of which names he
said were myths. He denied ever
having seen or treated the decedent.

JURY IS SWORN
IN WILL CASE
Ready to Begin Introduction
of Evidence in Battle
Over the Seymour Estate
WIDOW THE PLAINTIFF
Her Share, Under Testament,
of Fortune Approaching
$1,000,000 but $30,000
A jury has been secured in Judge
Kerrigan's court to try the contest of
the will of the late capitalist, Simon
H. Seymour, instituted by his widow,
Susan Seymour. Though Seymour,
who died at Barlett Springs on June
24, 1904, left an estate valued at
$7 00,000, he bequeathed to his wife
but $30,000, her community share in
the Seymour Hotel of Los Angeles.
In his will Seymour stated that with
the exception of the hotel named all
of his property was separate proper- |
ty and was the fruit of $200,000 in
vested in City Hall lots on Market
street, property on Pine street and
the St. George stables. At one time
Seymour was the owner of the Russ
House, but his interest in that hos
telry was disposed of many years ago.
He bequeathed one-third of his so
called separate estate to his sister,
Henrietta F. Eckhardt; one-third to
the two children of a deceased sister,
Louisa Hebrock, and one-third to the
seven children of a deceased half
brother, Henry Kardmeyer. All of
these heirs reside in Germany.
Mrs. Seymour contests the claim
that all but the Seymour Hotel was
the separate property of the deceased
and she also contends that at the time
the will was executed, March 15,
1891, the testator was not of sound
mind. She therefore asks that the
will be set aside and that she be given
a widow's share of the estate under '
the law of succession.
During the examination of venire
men yesterday Julius Heyman of 309
Van Ness avenue said he did not want
to serve as a juror because he was
constitutionally opposed to will con
tests and furthermore was a friend of
Attorney McPike, who is associated
with Attorneys Sullivan & Sulivan for
the contestant. He was forthwith
challenged by the contestant's coun
sel, but a surprise was in store for :
him.
Judge Kerrigan said he had a the
ory as to Heyman's alleged constitu
tional opposition to will contests, his
theory being that Heyman wished to
escape servioe as a juror. So he di
rected Heyman to appear this morn
in<- to see if some other case does not
need his attendance. '* is very proba
ble that Heyman will report regularly
uhder this order until some case is
found upon which he can pass Judg
ment without interfering with his
conscience.

BID FAREWELL
TO THEIR CHIEF
General Moore Is Tendered
Banquet on Eve of His
Retirement From Army
General Francis Moore, commander
of the Department of California, who
retires from the service of the army
to-morrow, was the gruest of honor at
a farewell banquet at the Bohemian
Club on Monday night. The affair
was a testimonial of warm friendship
on the part of the officers of the de
partment and division staff. The red
room was the scene of the festivities.
Major Samuel W. Dunning was toast
master, and speeches of an informal
character were the order of the even
ing, the love and respect in which
General Moore is held was the topic
and from every one came expressions
of regret that so able an officer was to
leave the service of the United States
army.
General Moore was deeply moved
by the sentiments expressed by his
brother officers. He replied in a short
speech. He said that although he was
retired by the age limit and that on
the morning of Thursday, April 6, he
would cease to be an active officer of
the army, he should always be with
his confreres, heart and soul. So long
as he lived he would be at his coun
try's call, he said, under whose flag
he had served for forty- five years.
The decorations of the banquet hall
were superb. American Beauty roses
decked the festive board, and Ameri
can flags draped the walls.
Those present were:
General Francis Moore. Colonel John D. Hall.
Colonel William S. Patten. Colonel Stephen P.
Jocelyn. Colonel George Andrews. CoJonel Wil
liam H. Birkhlmer, Colonel Sedgwtak Pratt.
Colonel William H. Comegys. Major Samuel W.
Dunning. Major C. A. Devol. Major Charles R.
Krauthoff, Major Henry M. Morrow. Major
Frank F. Eastman. Major George O. Squler.
Major John P. Wisser. Captain William C.
Wren, Captain James Canby. Captain Frank
U Winn, Cai>tain James W. McAndrew and
Lieutenant Creed F. Cox.
Yesterday afternoon the medical de- !
partment of the United States General
Hospital at the Presidio paid their re
spects to General Moore, and at the i
same time called on Colonel John D. ]
Hall, the new chief surgeon an the ;
department staff. Lieutenant Colonel
George H. Torney, commanding the de
partment at the hospital, was in charge
of the party. The other officers were
Surgeons John H. Allen, R. E. Noble,
W. T. Davidson, John L. Shepard. Wil-.
Ham L. Keller, Charres F. Craig,
Thomas J. Strong and G. P. Dillon.
