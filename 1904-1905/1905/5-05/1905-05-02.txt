expend $75,00,000, pis ' 1 canrpaign { esti
mate, he could not only get ; sontrol ,'of
the Various " fraction *lines * in : Chfcag'o,
but could pay for ihejn and rehabilitate
them* v all for less than 550.000.000.' â¢Â»<-
Thiis came the first declaration' from
the Mayor concerning the repo'rVfrom
J. H.Cummings, the car building- and
traction expert, Cummings,.iji his de
tailed statement to the-Mayor, declares
that /'with the water all squpeied put"
the traction systems c may â be* acquired
and. rehabilitated for. twice the rum 'it
cost Uhe Wall street crowd to gÂ«t con
trol of the city railway properties. Â£
It had been- the intention of the
Mayor to transmit the report to- the
Council to-night, but at the suggestion
of Clarence S. Darrow this ' step was
delayed for further consideration. % It
is probable a radical suggestion will
be made to the municipal legislature a
week from to-night.

t The greatest importances attached
to the following Js that it concerns
a San Francisco citizen. It would lose
three-quarters of its interest if it
involved some resident of Kalaina-
zoo, Mtclu, oosr s Woonsocket, R. -I.
Like all the testimony which has ap-
peared btre, and like all which? will
follow about the Old Quaker Hem;
etiy, Doan's Kidney Pills, it comes
from residents, fellow citizens and
neighbors. tNo other rentedy can
show such â¢ a record* of borne cures.
Read this case: 9
Louis a Sanquinnetti, hnckster, of
1319 Dupont street, *says: "I was so
crippled with para m my backâ in* j
fact, I was laid up with itâ r that I could
not attend to my work,, when Doan's j
Kidney Pills came to my notice and
I took a course of m the treatment
Previous to that I had exhausted my
knowledge of known remedies gath-
ered from reading atid prescribed by
my friends. Some* recommended
this and some recommended that. I
took Doan's Kidney Pills as I' had
taken other preparations in the past,
with very little expectation of receiv-
ing any results, and I must confess I
was more than surprised . when the
aching in my back stopped. That is
six monfhs ago, and it has not re-
turned. I honestly recommend
Doan's Kidney Pills to others., so
that they may know about a* prepara-
tion upon which they can depend."

lads â what - a blessed privilege to be

bravely as "becomes: lads of . grammar

Now, if there's ahything that jars a
boy's nerves more than waiting, I don't
know what it can be. This. distaste for
"waiting," by the way, grows, up ..with
them to; manhood, but during a wait
of an hour for. the arrival of the band
these lads were an gelic. * It was mar
velous to. those who know boys. to see
thÂ«m sit that hour through without

Then Mr. Innes and his . men ap
peared, and the concert was on. ,
Perhaps In all Christendom: there's
not a better place for the murder of
music than the Mechanics' Pavilion,
but the. music of Innes iaeld its: own
in spite of the maddening acoustics.
And his soloists ? were much en
joyed, even to the extent â¢of v " hearty
encores. Here poor Kryl got some
what beyond his depth in. the deepest
of the deep notes :in "Rocked in > the
Cradle of the Deep." But : for this he
was freely forgiven for the nice thing
he did ihÂ»his "Fantasy."
But it was the ' children led by
Estelle Carpenter that the people had
come to ; hearâ those 3000 - little . chil
dren whose voices rose' up like in
cense to the Almighty.
Who of you who' heard .those chil
dren jsing, out of the fullness: of their
young, hearts. "Praise Ye the Father,"
can ever forget; the ' r exaltation of the
moment? w *
Then the "Birds , of Spring," given
with the joyousness erf childhood, with
lightness, sprightllhess \ and buoyancy
of tone, was a; wonder,' with'i its 3000
voices in- perfect unls"on- and with
never the lag of a note.
- And this, by the- way,. without the
help. of. Innes .'and', his men, who * some-I
how had lost "or. forgotten their music;'
and 'Mrs. ., M.' "McGlade,^ aasLstant'

supply the money for. this a successful appeal
was made Co friends .of the unl^'erslty ; and of
science In LoÂ« Angeles and elsewhere. Funds
to the amount, of about JISOO were,- secured,
with which a large though open gasoline

Moment after moment comes up- for

ful, one is first and last, too, for Miss
Marlowe'sr elocutio'n^* loveliness itself.
It is as clear as may be, accented, col

of Bach played .by Kreisler. Every
shade of the mea.ning of "the lines, is
illumined; and moreover every vocal
beauty lent.. Poor Shakespeare! To
â¢ imagine Beatrice in hte time played
only -by boys! "
Mr. Sothern' has done many things
"better than his, Benedick it may be
prefaced, but* M*nl Sothern can do
nothing ill. That it "is not likable,
that you .laugh at, rather .than with
it, is the most poignant fault of the
figure. Mr. Sothern takes his Bene
dick in 1 rather the light comedy view
.than as a character portrait. Up to
â¢the scene in the church one finds the
figure lacking much of manliness,
robustness, sturdihess. Take the scerife
in the garden after the plotters 'have
convinced Benedick that Beatrice
loves him. Benedick* is, here puzzled
'through his, simplicity, netted: through
his honesty, and blundering a bluff
way* through; bin it is .rather a
Malvolio-like conceif, something, of
the'coxcomb, that one finds Mr. .Soth
ern affecting to the .discovery. A
rather effeminate niake-up further
combines against the illusion, and one
is led frequently to \u25a0wonder what over
whelming attractlbn this particular
Benedick has for this particular Beat
rice. In Jhe church scene things alter.
Mr. ' Sothern * here becomes spirited,
virile, convincing â - hbw other with
â¢that bewitching damsel to inspire ?
There is to thank . Mr. Sothern
further, "for a performance : most "per
fect in detail and of a, smoothness of

"I knew teat say cast was a" bad or.c and

sary I probably would lose my life under It.
Wcause this tumor on ray neck had grown
* around the Jugular rein ar.d in all prcbab'.lltj ]
la cutting it Â«ut this important blood veÂ«sel
would likely have been injured and of course
in thy cent I would have bled to'dea-th.
Â° Bo when the Electro-Chemic specialists- told
me that the Electro-Chemic treatment- would
cure me painlessly and wiUicut an operation
- .it was a great relief indeed. The marvelous
\ j.-Â«.rt- of all this is the short time and the
small expense of my cure by Electro-chem-
istry. ! The ' whole expense was less than fifty
callers 'and the time required for the 'cure
only a little more than one month. The sur
c crical operation would have cost at least five
huadrea dollars asd my life would have been
put into Jeopardy, saying nothing of the pain
.and inconvenience of such an.- operation. There
: is no doubt ; in the world but that the Electro-
Chemic treatment is the safest and surest

THE CHICAGO STRIKE.
THE proposition to splicit the attention of the" President \u25a0 to the
strike in Chicago removes that e vetit from its local theater and
\ gives it a national aspect It is quite* doubtful whether .the
grounds -exist that were present \n the coal strike. -That struggle
affected interstete commerce in coal, a prime necessity, ,of life, >at a
season* when* it was" most needed. The coal famine affected ;the
â¢ Government- itself, by threatening to* stop Hhe supply* of ,hcat ;.;aind
* light in the Federal buildings*, at Washington, by which the^-public
business would have been suspended, * In that .strike the issues
werp direct and judicable, in which respect they differed sharply
from Che present issues in Chicago. * * * â¢ .â¢
' *The firm,. of Montgomery Ward* & Co., a large mall order
house, Jiad a dispute with their, manufactu^ring .employes. .They had
â¢ v *a contract with their teamsters, made with their union, that was
. satisfactory *to. both parties/ These teamsters, were called out. by
4 their national organization, t and, in disregard â¢of their ; contract,
struck,* with no question of hours or 'wages involved, but avowedly
fbr the purppse of compelling Montgomery # Ward & Co. -to make,
a contract satisfactory to their other employes, not connected wi.th
the teaming of c the 'firm. * Montgomery Ward &* Co. 'oftered. to ar
bitrate the- matter with their teamsters, . and Mr. Shea, the presi-^
denÂ£ of tHe National Teamsters' organisation, declined/, saying that*
â¢\u25a0*as the teamsters have, no "grievance there was nothing to arbitrate.
This seemed "to be in disregard of the rights of the firm./ It had a
grievance because its teamsters had' broken their contract. * But
jtliis.cwas not regarded^y Mr. Shea as 'important or entitled to ajbi
tration.,, *: * . V* ! * -\u25a0 *" â¢ â¢"" ... Â«
.altVwfll'jbe observed- that, up to -this point th& dispute presents
the .same issues tha'f-were involved. in the railroad strike of', 1894.
purposed that' was to compel railroad coippanies to forfeit
-- their contracts -with the Pullman [Company in prder* to -compel the
latter^ company, under duress, to change its contract -.with its men.
The members of the American Railway Unipn obeyed the 'orders
* of Mr. Debs and struck, at the same time declaring that' they bad |
00 Â«. grievance against their â¢' respective employers. This ' Â«left noth
4 to arbitrate, except the grievance of the: employers, wKich Mr.
' Debs, like Mr. Shea, did not consider; worthy of attention." * * .
Hi is conceded now* in Qiicagd- that* if Montgomery Ward &
Xo". c had' violated the contract 'with their, teamsters, the latter would j
Have had relief Jn the courts, which would have" compelled* the*, firm
to^ perform its contract. -The teamsters /being, in "a voluntary _or
"ganization, and' not being either firm or. a'. corporation,. and riot
.possessing either partnership or corporate property* can jsafely vio
late its contract, leaving the firm -without redress.. This .is a-situa-.
tio^that deserves the closest study, by- the "labor leaders of the"
countrj% Their policy is for.; collective bargaining for labor, the
making of a CQllective, contract. -But. a contract^ is : 'vain -unless it is
c .bilateral. r It ; rriust imply mutual â¢' responsibility an.d,. obligation^ If
one party to it enter into an* undertaking witHout the -power to per
form it, the'eontract is void or* voidable in'law. ;- ** . â¢ ." â¢ . '
Ther ccc c caa be no- unilateral contract in such a. matter. A con
tract that -Hinds' only\one of "the parties is, .ac vain thing, that* has
ono standing in law. Analysis of- such .a, situation bdngs ; into strong,
relief a policy that t is intended .to; compel an employer- to ."make a
contract" which binds* him to -its' ekecution but .leave's ihe other
party free to violate it* at. will. /This is the situation in. Chicago that
has involved the whole' teaming' trade of that city."* Our institu
tions are. founded upon the freedom, and equality of contract. The
recent decision of tHe United ' States -. Supreme Court in the New
York tert-hour .case affirms the principle most -positively. The in-"
telligent lab'Qr leaders must see. that if their principle of : collective
contract is to meet with .public favor it rriustc6hforra t to the 'law Of
contract^ by' providing- mutuality of responsibility.. ' *
c If the present issue in' Chicago is settled .by the President or
ajiybody else opon the theory* that the emplo5 r er*rnay," by Violent in
terruption of his business, be* compelled 'to make* a collective-con
tract which "only he.'must keep, leaving the dther party* free to
: violate it, as'ivas done by ' Montgomery Ward & Co.'s teamsters, it
will not be a permanent settlement. It is tHe practice of # s"hort
sighted men to inveigh against the courts' and to .denounce govern
ment 8 fey injunction when they have compelled a community to
, choose between that and government by-a mob. But "one* thing is
cerfain â the courts will hot" enforce npn-mutual contracts; .If a col
lective cQntr^ct is non-mutual, as* Mr.. Shea insists that it is, if is
no contract at all, and by insisting upon this feature collective bar
gaining-, destroys itself. â¢' â¢
These questions are sufficiently intenesting without going into
tHe unpleasant features of the affair, -the daily mobs, and * violence,
whi^h arje the disquieting features of labor disputes in this country,
especially in^ our large cities. Such things forfeit the support of
public opinion and' cannot be justified upon any theory consistent
with personal liberty sup/ported* by law. No good citizen can be* an
indifferent spectator, while personal and ' property- 1 -' rights are
*abridge*d by surrendering to lawless violence. Jt becomes the duty
'of^all such to appeal to the law and the duty of. its executors is to
rigidly enforce it. When Ihe supremacy of the law makes 'the
public streets and highways safe to every citizen and gives to ( eacli
complete protection, iji the* pursuit*of his vocation and; the earning of
his bread, the labor organizations of the country \vill be great gain
ers.-jfor then everything affecting their interests will come to a just
judgraentj unaffected" by prejudice and passion, fear, or coercion. ,

the Judge, drank v great quantities of,

Mark's Church, Berkeley, presided as
chairman. Twenty-three questions
6 verb oti the programme for discussion,
but owing to the length of time tie
voted to some, but six were reviewed.
The question .of using the prayer
book during Sunday .school service"
was thoroughly discussed, -the major
ity's opinion being that the prayer'
ibook should displace the hymnal
among the* older pupils. The matter
of compelling teachers to pass an ex
amination before being allowed to
command classes brought out jaany
Interesting points , for Â«and against.
Many favored the idea of appointing
â¢a field secretary,* who should be thor
oughly familiar with Sunday school
. tcork, to devote his entire time" pre
paring ior' Sunday school work. 4 To
educate children In, giving ' was com
bined with the' question, phould the
Sunday school be self-supporting, and
this brought out* many arguments be
tween tke prelates and teachers; The
matter was not .definitely settled.
Other matters of less Importance con
cluded the afterxoon's work.
Questions or Instructing the Youth in

PresUent Foster- Says If Creditors Are
* Patient They Will Receive [Dol
lar for Dollar. |
Yesterday was tne : date for the pay-,
ment of the 'interest on the outstand
ing bonds of the Xorth Shore Railroad
and the fact that a settlement was not
made' with the Mercantile Trust"Com
pany, which is acting as trustee of the
bonds, gave* rise to the report that the
bondholders were about to bring fore-"
closure proceedings against the com
pany. A. W. Foster, president of the
road,' Into .whose hands the corpora
tion recently passed, admitted yester
day afternoon thaj. his company was
In default on its interest and he made
the following statement: . * .
It Is a fact tbat 'we are behind in our pay
ments, but I am working" hard to meet O)1T
obligations. The North Shore Railroad, as
nearly everybody .understands. Is overloaded
with bonded Indebtedness, and I am trying
to etralg-htea out Us difficulties. It is not a
paying concern as yet and one of the plans
wÂ« hayÂ« under way' is a reorganisation, which
we hop* to effect before long. Ail that I can
cay Is -that If the bondholders will have a little
patience,' and 1 think they win. we will, pay
dollar for dollar and eventually place .the"; en
tire North, Shore road on a paying basis. -\u25a0
Among local' financial men confl
"dence .is â¢ expressed in President Fos
ter's ability to . relieve the- coast road
of its embarrassments and it is under
stood that no immediate action on the
â¢part of the bondholders toward fore
closure* proceedings is contemplated.

being in; her lap, w^ien she heard a

tive [conflict^ but 7 as . the scene of battle
was around^a corner she could not see
who the combatants were. From the
fact, however, that she heard ths voice
of Mrs. Donaldson shout, ''Bob ! / Bob! ".
she .naturally inferred that Mr. Don

and after depositing her baby in. a safe

should become necessary to protect her

There is a divergence of* opinion be
tween Joseph S. Tobin, the present at
torney for Mrs. Herman Oelrichs and
j Mrs. William K.*Vanderbilt Jr., on the
j one side, and their late attorneys, Reu
ben H. Lloyd and C. J. Heggerty, re
garding the matter of 'attorneys' fees
in connection with the winding, up Â«of
the estate of the late. Charles L. Fair.
Th? point will *be argued before Judge
Cook at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
When the order 6f distribution of* the
estate was made' some months ago a
sum was reserved to pay the collat
eral inheritanpe tax and the fees of
the administrator and his attorneys. A
citation was served upon LJoyd and
Heggerty to appear in Judge Cook's
court > last Tuesday., They did not ap
pear and an order was made by the
Judge to the effect that the tax ansl
Zees referred to had been settled," prac
tically winding up the estate. ...
Later LJoyd and Heggerty discovered
that, hr the citation after the * words
"f or services rendered" the' words ' "or
to be rendered" _hssd been Interlined,
which had escaped their observation.
They objected * that the order should
not apply to services to be 'rendered,
as there .were several suits yet pending
against the estate in which they were
representing the administrator and
they should be "paid for theic services.
Â« Judge Cook made 'â an order" to show
can*e why the order made.* last Tues
day she/old not be revoked, a"nd -the at
torneys appeared before him yester
day morning.' .Tobin wanted time to
communioate with his * clients. The
â¢Judge said he would continue the case
$ill this afternoon, when the attorneys
must be prepared with* their, argu
ments. \u25a0". â¢

The: final decision -was handed down
by the United States Circuit Court or
-Appeals yesterday.- The case wu that
( cf Ah" Sou, a. Chinese slave girl, -who
.tvas landed at Seattle on the pretense
that she xraa the . daughter of Mas
\u25a0Sou, a merchant <jf that city. It 'was
*ho\ra afterward Ujat she \ras not his

\u25a0\u25a0who had bought her in China- After
being landed she "was placed in a dis

[home lry Portland. Becoming tired of
the home and .srtshlng to leave it. she
:*vent* through the ceremony of mar
riare to jl Chinese 'laborer, but the
*iuarriase neVer consummated.
The Judge of the District Court,,ln
\u25a0cornrnc^ting uj>ao her case spoke as
toUows: v â¢ . '
- "If sent bade to bar own. country,
where Ebe was by .her kindred sold to
;a cruel master, she must abandon all
hope.- It -is shocking to contemplate
tbat the laws of. our country require
the .court to use "Its processes to ac
complish such -an 'unholy purpose. The
efforts which the appellant made to
escape from thraldom, to rise from her
condition of degradation, entitle her to
humane consideration, . and .I \u25a0 cannot
Eti any other way }n which td emand
: pate her from' actual slavery.** j .
â¢ Thereupon the Judge vacated the or
der of deportation and the Government
appealed. In reversing the humane rul
ing of the lower tribunal the United
States Circuit Coart of Appeals says:
"The case- is one which from Its na
.ture enlists the .sympathy of the court,
but we regret that the* law is so writ
ten that it does not permit us to yield
to the .humane consideration which
actuated the rourt below. "We see *no

Judgment of ..the trial court must be
reversed \u25a0end the appellee remanded' to

Although the rain came down in tor
rents and prevented the game at Rec
reation Park yesterday afternoon be
tween Stanford and the Japanese base
ball team from Waseda a f rowd of ovÂ«r
700 Japs assembled and patiently
awaited the i call of time. Examina
tions . stared several yf the Palo Alto
collegians in the face, still they were
loath to ask for a postponement The
visitors did not care to perform on the
sloppy diamond, but were too game to
voice a wish" to have the contest called
off till another day. Shortly after 3
o'clock both tlubs trotted on to the
soggy. field and found that. ball playing
was practically impossible, so a com
promise was effected and the delayed
game will be played this afternoon at 3
o'clock, weather permitting:.
Of the entire assemblage yesterday
les&'than'. twenty native .. American*
were present because the regular base
ball enthusiasts knew that a game was
improbable under the weather condi
tions. The Japanese were satisfied with
a view of their ; fellow-countrymen in
uniform and none hesitated to. take tha
rain checks that will be honored this
afternoon. . â¢ #
The brief preliminary practice de
veloped the fact in the minds of those
present that the visitors have a well
defined *Idea of the game. "One left*
handed member of the . squad had "all"
the movements of "Kid"Â» Mohler. and
the ".team showed snap and
speed. "With a pleasant day the fan 3
this afternoon should fill the stands
to overflowing if for nothing more than
the novelty of seeing a genuine Jap
anese club for the first time.
Enough rain fell at Oakland yester
day to keen <he % favorites aflcat, still
four -were caught without lite preserv
ers and tailed to dance around the May
pole. The headliners were: Lily Gel
ding. Dr. Sherman, liaura F M and
Golden Ivy. a quartet of fancy-priced
ones, for the most part overlooked by
the talent. \u2666
Rcy del Muxido, the big; Baldwin colt,
finally graduated from the* maiden
class:, he \vp:it to the post a 9 t0 .5 fa
vorite for the rive-furlong two-year
old scramble, and with "Handridlng"
Kt-Ily up won ridden out from Ancient
Witch and Midraont. Husan, the
brother to Ilumo, finished fourth.
AftVr shooting at the target and
making several misses. Collector Jes
eup picked up a purse. The New York
er was thrc-ivn in with some very or
dinary material in the five and a half
furlong purse number, closing an 11 to
iU choice. Lloyd Fountain had hini in
front fclmost from the si:?rt, brtezjng
home four lengths ahead of Ed Lilburn
aiid Oronte. *
The odds ab6ut Lily Golding, winner
of the Futurity course dash folio-Ring,
were fat enough to make a griddle cake
look like a rice pudding. The mare
v,er4 to thd post a 20 and 25 to 1 chance
and.Jn a driving finish, Herbert landed
lier first, less- than a length before Sun
Mark,*acoihor outsider.^. After leading
almost to tht- isaddock, the -, favorite,
Phalanx, ran third. *
.Mcifride's handling of El Chihuahua,
favorite for the first si^-furlong run,
gazed upon from a bookmaker's point
of view, c'oul3 not bave" been, excelled.
Mounted on " a fast brealcer, McÃride
got his mount away badly.'and for the
benefit of the judges came with a great
splurge at tflt close, finishing third.
Why rides of this *Â«brt are tolerated is
a mystery- Dr. Sherman, .the winner,
ridden by Stewart, was .backed down
from 15 to 12, and -in a driving finish
downed Doublet a head.
D/ll Fountain's mare Laura F. M. re
peated her run of, last Saturday by
capturing the split of the six-furlong
selling affair, played from 6 -down to A.
She had Lloyd Fountain In the saddie,
and disposed of Matt Hogan and Pick
away very easily at the wire. F. Sul
livar. on the favorite, Alice Carey;
succeeded in* getting lost in. the shuffle.
Although" Forest King wore blinkers
and received considerable backing to
win ifte mile and seventy yard purse,
Ralph Voting" lowered the colors of "the
Oregon hoise. The Tatter had" a decided
call in the ring and, leading through
out, earned the 'decision by" nearly a
length. The show went to' Sheriff Bell.
Knapp on Byronerdaie, favorite for
the concluding . mile and a 'sixteenth
selling- fixture, tossed aw&y his chance
of securing brackets in the stretch. He
took his mount out .from the rail and

SAYS OFFICIAL
IS PERJURER
The, Sutter Street" Improvement Club
yesterday petitioned the .Board of Su
pervisors to make an investigation of
the Sutter- street railroad, which is
characterized .as unwarrantably bad.
The board ' is asked to take action to
remedy the evil. The petition says:
The' eervice by the United Railroads on its
Sutter street : system Is unwarrantably bad.
Tee cars, are old, .rickety and unsightly, the
tracks and pavements are badly worn and In
a dangerous condition, and the number of cars
operated Is . insufficient to accommodate the
traffic of the streets, causing overcrowding of
the oars, and' depriving many persons of the
service tKe c6mnany contracted to give when
if accepted- this franchise. The operation of
the read under present conditions is dangerous
to tie. life of passengers, as well as to <hose
who-ut-e t>e street.
The company has disregarded the repeated
requests of the Satter Street Improvement Club
that It Improve the service of this . tiystam; and
desires to Install the overhead trolley, â¢ not
withstanding m 2 per cent of the prcpirty own
ers affected have signed a protest against the
construction of such an unsightly and danger
ous system.
As this is a matter of general concern, and
effects the convenience, life and property of
the people of the city, we respectfully request
your board to make a complete Investigation of
the affairs of this company pertaining to this
question, and that you taks such action as
may be in your power to remedy this evil,
which is a disgrace to the city. Respectfully,
SUTTF.R STREET IMPROVEMENT CLUB.,

Sawyer. R. Spreckels, J. B. Levison. Big.
Stem, jr; H. Hazell. Dr. GeonreX W. Hazell,
Dr. Julius Rcsenstira. Edward P.. E. Troy,
secretary. -â¢ *. . ...
The "board-finally* passed the declara
tory ordinance for the acquisition of
the Geary street road by the city. and
its conversion into an electric under
ground i system. Supervisors Lunstedt
â¢and Gallagher, who were not present
when the ordinance was passed to
print, expressed themselves in favor of
the proposition, though the former held
that other public utilities, such as
Vater, ' gas and telephone service,
should be acquired first.
The board authorized an expenditure
of $300 to pay for the services of J. C.
H. Stut as engineer in revising ' plans
and estimates of cost of converting the
Geary street railroad Into a municipal
electric' road.
The Sutter Street Improvement Club
filed resolutions approving the action of
the board, which the club says will
bring about the construction of a mod
ern conduit electric system on GeaiÂ»y
street- \
, The Civic League petitioned the Su
â¢pervieors that all the money that is to
be -expended 'on permanent Improve
ments next year, aside from the Geary
"street road, be applied to the - public
schools. The petition states that most
of the school buildings are unsafe and
unsanitary and all classes are shock
ingly overcrowded, with , 17,000 children
.who cannot find a place in the schools.
This is a conditipn that will not per
mit of delay and assumes the nature
of an emergency, the petition says.

William. Heyden. who, it: was testi
fied, had $5000 in bank less than a year

days by Judge Troutt yesterday for
contempt of court for failing to pay

answer to anorder toshowcause Hey
den went . to court and frankly admit
ted on the stand that he had lost all of
his \ money playing the races and gam
bling in mining stocks. The court held,
however,'. that it was plain that if Hey
den desired, he could dig $85 out 'of the
wreck of his fortune, and found him
guilty of / contempt. Heyden was
granted a two days' stay of execution
at the/ request- of his counsel. It -is
probable that: if he finds. the $S5 during

dress her,' I had to put her on the table,
for I could not hold her. â¢ She would
kick and scream, and when she could,
she' would tear her face and arms
almost to pieces. I used four boxes of
Cuticura Ointment, two cakes of Cuti-
cura Soap, and gave her the Cuticura
Resolvent, and she was - cured; and I
see no traces of the huinoa r left. I can
truthfully* say that they have saved
her life, and I should advise any one
suffering as she did, to give" Cuticura
a fair trial. Mrs* G. A. Conrad, Lis-
bon, N. H., Feb. 7, 1898."

"It is with pleasure that I can in-*

manent. It is now six years since she
was cured, -and there has been note-
turn of the disease since. I have ad-
vised a lot of friends to use Cuticura
in all diseases of the skin."
