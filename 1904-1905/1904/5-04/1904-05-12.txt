NEW YORK, May 11.â By consent of
the plaintiffs the action against Mrs.
Theresa Alice Oelrichs and Mrs. Vir
ginia Vanderbilt, brought by Hannah
E. Nelso-n. mother of Mrs. Charles L.
Fair, was dismissed here to-day In the
Stale Supreme Court. A final judg
ment was rendered in favor of the de
' fendants. Mr. and Mrs. Charles LÂ»
Fair were killed in an automobile ac
cident in France In 1902.
In a statement issued after the judg
ment had been entered the attorneys
for Mrs. Nelson and her family made
, it known that a settlement satisfactory
to both sides had been effected. They
announced also that by common con
sent of the persons interested the sum
paid in settlement would not be made
public. â¢ - . â¢
. The action was begun in February,
}303. to set afide the settlement made
at San Francisco in August, 1902, be
tween Mrs. XelBon and her family and
Mrs. Oelrichs and Mrs. Vanderbilt, sis
ters of Charles L. Fair, relative to the
distribution of the estates of Mr. and
Mrs. Fair.
MRS. NELSON'S SHARE.
Under this settlement Mrs. Nelson
received 5125,000 and members of her
family who were plaintiffs with her in
the ar-tion received smaller sums, vary
'irijr according to their relationship from
51^.000 to $1609.
â¢'hsrJes L. Fair left an estate valued
at about 53.000.0'V) and it was main
tained by the Nelsons that he died be
fore his wife, to whom he had willed
his entire estate in case she survived
him. The plaintiffs alleged that they
had been induced by fraud and mis
representations on the part of the de
fendants to accept the sum paid them
and that they did not learn until after- â¢
vard that Mr. Fair died first.
Mrs. Oelrirhs and Mrs. Vanderbilt
maintained that Fair had survived his
â¢vv'fe and that under the provisions of
his vtH the property became theirs.
Dunnjr the rourse of the action sev
eral commissions were appointed and
Â¦testimony was taken at the scene of
the accident in France, in this city and
Jn.San Francisco. Much of this tes
timony was conflicting.
- WTTXKSSKS A1UZ ARRESTED.
Two French witnesses, Lucien Mas
end Alfred J. Morranne. testified in this
â¢ city that they saw the accident and
that Mr. Fair was instantly killed,
v&fle Mrs. Fair lived several minutes.
These witnepses were arrested on their
return to Paris bÂ«Â»cause of their tes
timony, and on a charge of perjury
â¢were convicted and sentenced to three
years' imprisonment.
â¢In their statement the attorneys for
Jlrs. Nelson say they were moved to
agree to a *miement by the conflict-
Ing nature of the evidence in th*Â» case,
the great expense of the litigation and
â¢fey the fact that Mrs. Nelson is ad
vanced in yeare and desired to be re-
U*\ed of the strain of further fighting
the case. â¢*
In accounting for th* willingness of
the defendants to r^ach a settlement
lhp plaintiffs' attorneys say in part
.. "The technical allegation of fraud in
the complaint was extremely distaste
ful to Mrs. Oelrichs and Mr*. Vander
bilt. Neither of them had taken any
rerconal part in arranging the details
f'f the San Francisco settlement and
. both had presumed that everything
Had be*>n don* properly and to the sat
isfaction of every one concerned."
The trials of Dr. Dominador Gomex
and Buenaventura Kalbaza have re
sulted in their acquittal. Dominador
Gomez, a former Spanish officer and
ex-president of the Union Obrero, oth
erwise known as the Democratic Labor
Union, was arrested in September last
upon the charges of rebellion and insur
rection for inciting ladrone leaders In
the province of Luzon to take up arms
against the authority of the United
States.
Buenaventura Kalbaza, president of
the Nationalist party, was arrested at
the same time as Gomez and held to
answer on similar charges of rebellion
and insurrection against the authority
of the United States.

The Santa Fe train was late and
was running at a high speed. The elec
tric train approached the crossing,
which is at right angles to the Santa
Fe tracks, at full speed, probably thir
ty miles an hour. When within a
reasonable distance the motorman, as
he declares, applied the air brake, but
it refused to work. Nothing then" could
stop thÂ« train and It dashed against
the side of the Santa Fe smoker. The
impact broke the Santa. Fe train in
two, crushed in the side of the smoker
and tore away the platform of the day
coach. The smoker and the day coach
were derailed. The. motorman stuck
to his post and was uninjured. It is
not thought any of the injured will die,
though several are very seriously hurt.
TACOMA, Wash., May 11.â Albert E.
Mead of Whatcom was nominated for
Governor to-day by . the Republican
State Convention. The contest was a
"bitter one and resulted in a complete
victory for the Hill forces.
A feature of the convention was the
repudiation of Governor McBride and
his platform plank favoring the crea
tion by the next Legislature of a rail
road commission. The railroad forces
dominated by the Hill interests were
in complete control, and late this after
noon, after a vthree â¢ hours' J fight, they
defeated McBride's railroad Â¦ commis
sion plank by, a vote of 406 -out of 660
delegates. ; . ' . / â¢
...The platform instructs the delegation
toHhe national convention to support
Roosevelt. It indorses the administra
tions of McKinley and. Roosevelt, fa
vors protective tariff and indorses the
administration's Panama policy and
national irrigation projects. The plat
form contains this plank on currency:
"Our monetary system is now on
such a stable basis that men look back
in wonder and amazement when they
recall the wild vagaries and the still
wilder Democratic theories of 1S96."
By yesterday's decision to renom
inate the present Congressmen the pol
iticians were eliminated from the State
convention. A fierce Senatorial con
test Is now in progress between Sena
tor Foster of Tacoma and S. H. Piles
of Seattle. Piles' supporters last night
considered a proposition to. combine
with Governor McBride. To prevent
this and to insure the nomination of
the slate made up this morning, the
railroad leaders last night sent to Se
attle hurriedly for John D. Farrell. as
sistant to President Hill of the Great
Northern and his personal representa
tive in this State. Farrell forced the
nomination of Mead for Governor and
completed the slate, -which went
through with a rush late this afternoon.
The convention adjourned after com
pleting the following ticket:

JAPANESE OFF POSSIET.
Boat Appeal's in the Roadstead and
Suspicious Lights Are Seen.
POSSIET, Siberia, May 11.â A Japan
ese ' boat made its appearance ln the
roadstead two days ago and suspicious
lights have been seen. Everything Is
quiet here, but all is in readiness to
meet any landing of the enemy, whose
probable purpose is the cutting off of
Vladivostok.
VLADIVOSTOK, May 11. â All is
quiet here.
The enemy has not been sighted.
The commander of the defenses has
left Vladivostok after carefully review-
Ing the troops and Inspecting the forti
fications.
ST. PETERSBURG. May 11.â The
report that the Russian squadron at
Port Arthur was destroyed to. prevent
its falling into the hands of the en
emy is scouted at the Admiralty.
"We are not going to repeat the mis
take made at Sebastopol," said Vice
Admiral Rojestvensky, commander I of
the Baltic fleet. "If the worst comes
to the worst, the squadron will put to
sea, engage the enemy ,and inflict as
much damage as possible before Koinsc '
to the bottom. But you can say that
it' Is a little early yet to talk of ' such
desperation."
..The general staff is positive that
there has been no fight at Maotien
ling Pass," for the simple reason that
the Russians do not occupy it. Only
a few scouts were left there. Accord
ing to their reparts, the Japanese
forces at Fengwangcheng were divi
ded into two ln the advance, one part
moving forward toward Liaoyang and
the other marching toward Haicheng.
Both Liaoyang and Newchwang are
six days' march from Fengwangcheng.
Therefore, they argue, a fight of im
portance Is impossible for at least two
days. . '
The general staff is without infor
mation regarding the reported death
of Lieutenant-General Zassalitch, â¢ de
claring that it is not credible. The
possibility of a small engagement at
Wafungtien is admitted, although no
information has been received. But
if an engagement has occurred there
they insist it could not have been of
importance, as the garrison is small.
The Russian force at Newchwang is
withdrawing, but the place was ; still
held according to the last advices.
When the evacuation is completed, in
order to protect the foreign inhabitant;;
against brigands, China will be Invited
probably ' to send regular troops - to
Newchwang. It is explained that the
situation at Newchwang is anomalous.
Primarily the civil administration of a
city whose country is being invaded
remains in possession until the enemy
appears, but in this case Russia Is only,
administering it provisionally, China
being the real owner. /Â¦'''Â¦ Â¦
The information which has been re
ceived at the Foreign Office from M.
Plancon, secretary to Viceroy Alexleff,
who has a diplomatic agent at'New
chwang, Is not of an alarming,charac
ter, and the statement that 3000 Chinese
bandits are across the river waiting to
swoop on Newchwang the moment the
Russians depart is not credited.
In this connection it can be positively
stated that the advices at the Foreign
Office from China . are reassuring. It
Is believed that the restraint which is
being exercised at Peking by* all the
powers Is having effect. There. Is rea
son to believe that the Russians In
tend to hold the stations and railroad
between Port Arthur and Liaoyang and
probably Kaiping and that the latter
place will be put in a state to stand a
siege, the idea being that if it can hold
out for three months it will make the
relief of Port- Arthur much easler> r hen
General Kuropatkin Is ready to as
sume the offensive. Possibly the New r

VICKSBURG INCIDENT
WASHINGTON, May 11.â The State
Department has concluded not to make
an official protest to the Russian Gov
ernment against the latest utterances
of M. Pavloff. late Russian Minister
to Korea, relative to the conduct of the
officers of the United States ship Vicks
burg In reference to the succoring of
the survivors of the Variag and Ko
rietz. Naval officers here have shown
considerable feeling over the criticisms
as affecting the honor of the United
States navy and are desirous of having
an inquiry made as to why these state
ments were given publication in the
Official Messenger, thus stamping them
as official. The State Department offi
cials, however, are disposed to ignore
the incident, one of them explaining
that M. Pavloff 's utterances are, in a
measure, pardonable, ln view of the
humiliations which he has suffered in
being expelled from Korea. Making
due allowances for his state of mind,
according to the State Department offi
cials, the department will not notice
the matter.

Fears for the Safety of Her Sailors

WASHINGTON. May 11.â The Jap
anese Government is apprehensive as
to the Japanese sailors who were re
ported missing or captured ars a re
sult of Admiral Togo's last attack up
on Port Arthur in an attempt to close
the harbor. There were forty of these
men, whom the torpedo boats could not
pick up, and the Japanese Government
is anxious that any of them who were
luck", enough to escape drowning and
reach shore, shall be properly taken
care of by the Russians. Minister
Takahira to-day requested Secretary
Hay, as the custodian of Japanese In
terests during the war, to apply to
the Russian Government for informa

"The Russo-Japanese war," he said,

Von Kardorff further said that the

wounded from the battle of the Yalu
who arrived here to-day was Father
Stephen Tcherbackoffsky. the priest
v.ho lod'thf' charge of the Eleventh
Ilegriment a.t the battle of Kiuliencheng.
Father Stephen- said:
."On the morn\ng of the 1st of May I
arose at 3 o'clock, knowing that there
would be a terrible battle, and 1 was
determined to do my duty and to show
an example by my death. At 4 o'clock
1 prayed, then laid down my Bible and
etood with the company. As the com-
jjany moved forward to the charge I
blessed the soldiers and went in front
cf the liag with my cross in my hand,
standing by the side of my assistant,
Joseph Perch. Bullets were tlying all
around us. .
"I never felt my first wound. The
. second bullet struck my shoulder and
1 ..fell, losing consciousness. When I
' opened, iny eyes. I found my assistant
beniing over me with a smile on his
face. Seeing that I was alive, he
clutched rcy hand and then took me
off the field of battle." "
A train is leaving here carrying 175
cf the wounded from Kiuliencheng to

A Japanese guardsman who was
wounded in the stomach and was taken
prisoner April 30, when the Russians
drove his comrades from their posi
tion, gays that typhus is rampant

the Idndness of the Russians to 'him
and denies the reports that in order to
avoid being taken prisoners the Jap
. anese dash their heads against the
ground." He saye that behind General
Kuroki are other troop? the number
of which he does not know.
According to artillery officers the
.movements of the enemy's heavy guns
"will be extremely difficult -on account
of the condition of the roads. '
A panic occurred on the last train
â¢out nf Port Arthur immediately after
. the landing of the Japanese at Pitzewo.
The Japanese fired upon the train at
midday and the ladies and civilians
Ftrrtched themselves on the floor. A

the railroad returned the Japanese fire
and drove the enemy back. They then
retired.

CHEFU. May 12, 11:30 p.. m.â The of
ficers of steamers arriving from New
chwang discredit the stbry of the de
struvtion-by the Russians of their fleet
at P'jrt Arthur. :When the officers
passed Port Arthur last night (Wednes
day) they saw searchlights . flashing
from the ships and' forts. There were
no signs of the Japanese -fleet in the
vicinity. The officers further stated
that there w^re not to exdeed 1000 Rus-
Fian BOldien at Newchwang "and vicin
ity. There are only six light field guns
in the forts, all the big guns having
been taken to Laaoyang. The opinion
prevailed -'at Newchwang that Russia
intends restoring Ncwchwang, also the
district eastward to Tasichlao. the
junction of? r the railway, to China.
Colonel Munthe. military adviser to
Yuan Â£hai Kai. Viceroy of the province
cf ChiFi, is now at Newchwang ready
to take over the district. The Russian
troops, it is understood, will remain
until, the Chinese troops arrive. ..This
i*= to prevent looting by brigands. : .
Thd conduct of the Russian troops at
Port Ar'hur is. said to have been ex
cellent throughout.
CHEFU. May 11," 5 a, ra.â An unof
ficial Japanese dispatch has-been re
ceived here to the effect that the Rus
sians have destroyed their fleet at Port
Arthur. v
Besides acting-energetically in South
ern Manchuria^ and. moving on Hai
cheng, General Kuroki kept in mind
the necessity of outflanking General
Kuropatkin at Laioyang, as is shown
ln the fact that on the morning of May
10 he started a formidable force, con
sisting of a division of lnfajitjry and
forty guns \ and 1500 cavalry, toward
Saimadza.
In view of General Kuropatkin's
statement that an examination May 10
of the line between Saimadza and Feng
wangcheng failed to show the presence
of Japanese, the authorities are puz
zled as to Where the Japanese forces
came from.
A Japanese detachment is reported
officially to have occupied Kwantein
sien May 6, but it Is believed likely to
be a small scouting party belonging to
General Kurokl's army. *
The Associated Press has received
the following assurances from a mem
ber of the general staff:
"There are ample supplies of muni
tions of war at Port Arthur, but nat
urally General Kurbpatkln desired to
send as much as possible to the fort
ress. During the expected siege great
quantities of shells and explosives will
be fired, and we cannot afford to per
mit the reproach of the defenders that
they could not hold Port Arthur be
cause of a lack of powder and shell.
But, I assure you, there are enough
supplies there for a year.
"With such a large force of the en
emy before Port Arthur, It is well un
derstood here that it is a question of
days, perhaps hours, before communi
cation is again cut off."
ST. PETERSBURG, May 12, 3:35" a.*
m. â Impending events of grave impor
tance to the military situation In Man
churia are foreshadowed .' in official
dispatches given out last, night by the
War Commission. -
On May 8 the Japanese' force cau
tiously moved from Fengwangcheng
toward Haichene, which is thirty-two
miles east by nortfc of Newchwang,
and it is the opinion of the gen
eral staff that they Should certainly
reach their destination within two'
days. If the Japanese occupy
Haicheng, with^. Port Arthur effect
ively cut off, Newchwang; which the
Russians have already dismantled,
would pass into their hands. The en
tire Liaotung peninsula, in' fact, save
Port Arthur and : perhaps Kaiping,
would be commanded by them.'
The troops sent by General Kurokl
to the southwest of Fengwangcheng,
which troops, it is established, do not
belong to a third army, none having
fended at Takushan, crossed the Tay
ang River May, 7 and should by this
time be operating In the Liaotung pe
ninsula, provided, they continued, as is
regarded probable/ the plan being to
complete the mastery of Southern Man
churia. . *
"A sotnia of Cossacks on the morning
of May 7 approached within nine miles
of Luanmiao and became engaged in
a fusillade with a Japanese company.
The latter soon received reinforce
ments, our sotnia finding itself op
posed to a Japanese battalion and
half a squadron of cavalry.
"Meanwhile Japanese infantry effect
ed a crossing of^the river by turning
to the left of the' sotnia.
"Commander Saraieff withdrew his
men. But before arriving within six
miles of Sedzekhoge he encountered
the enemy's cavalry, which retreated
under <jur* fire.
','We sustained .no losses in either en
counter. The Japanese seemed to have
lost an officer and a soldier." -
ST. PETERSBURG, May/ 11.â The
General Staff has received' the follow
ing dispatch .from General Karevltch
bearing to-day's date: "According to
reports from the region of the Tay
a'nhe (Tayang) River, sent on the
evening of May 8, the Japanese had
not yet occupied Taku Shan,
Grand Duke Mlphael, the , heir pre-
Bumptive to the ' Russian throne,
inarched with one of the foot guard
regiments, In which he is a lieutenant.
The very earth seemed to tremble
under the thunder of the hÂ«rses f hoofs.
On they came, at such a mad pace that
it seemed as if they must carry down
all before them. Instinctively those In
the boxes drew back, but scarcely five
paces beyond .the Emperor, Grand
Duke Vladimir threw up his sword and
the line stopped dead, many horses
being thrown upon their haunches, but
not a man or beast went down. A
great burst of applause came from the
spectators. Then, in accordance with
the, custom, the' commanding officers
moved up to' hear the Emperor's criti
cism, and at the same time the senior
non-commissioned officers of each de
tachment of troops repaired to the im
perjal .pavilion to pay his respects to
the" Empress. She rewarded the non
commissioned, officers by directing the
distribution of three rubles to each and
one ruble to each man participating in
the review." - "' '
The review concluded with a charge
of 10.000 cavalry at full speed across the
plain. With a front half a mile wide
the magnificent horsemen, in strange
and multi-colored uniforms and with
flags and pennants streaming, shot for
ward as if one man at the command of
the Grand Duke Vladimir, who is com r
mander in chief of all the guard regi
ments.
REWARDS THE OFFICERS.
The Emperor watched each detach
ment keenly, a bugler by his side
sounding the Imperial commands.
When his Majesty signified his ap
proval of a particularly smart body of
troops, with one voice the soldiers
ehouted "We are glad to do the best
we can for your Majesty."
Almost in front of the Imperial pav
ilion a wheel horse of one of the bat
teries fell. . His Majesty instantly com
manded a halt, personally riding out
to ascertain the cause of the acci
dent.
It was a proud military array, though
perhaps the effect was more medieval
than modern. ... .Â»
On the appearance of the Emperor
the standards were lifted, the bands
burst forth and tens of thousands of
throats roared a welcome. Like a
shuttle the cortege passed back and
forth as the Emperor inspected the
various regiments. "Good day, my
children," was his universal greeting.
"Good health, your Imperial Majes
ty," was the unfailing response. "When
the inspection was completed the
bands were massed opposite the Im
perial pavilion. The Empress took heF
place with her suite and moved some
distance to the right. Out in front,
alone, save for a bugler and the guards
in bright crimson, the Emperor sat
on his charger like a statue. He looked
strong and well. Then the defile of
splendid battalions began, the bands
playing regimental airs throughout the
review.
ST. PETERSBURG, . May 11.â There
were scenes' of martial splendor on the
Champs de Mars to-day when Emperor
Nicholas held his annual review of the
detachments of -all troops in the. mili
tary district at Petersburg, which
Includes every regiment of the Imperial
Guard.* The foreign military, attaches
scrutinized withi much more than or
dinary care the defile of crack regi
ments of the empire, which is now bat
tling to maintain its position in the
Far East, and the general verdict was
that no better body of soldiery could be
seen in Europe.
The field on which the review was
held presented a striking picture.
Drawn up on the vast plain were 40,-
Q00 of the finest troops in the empire
arrayed in brilliant uniforms.
Preceded by the generals in lamb
skin caps and followed by an imposing
entourage which included the military
attaches, among whom were Captain
B. T. Mctt and Major McComl>, repre
senting the United States the imperial
cortege moved through the summer
garden to the plain. The Empress and
the Emperor's mother rode in an open
state carriage, with Cossack footmen,
and drawn by six white stallions. The
Emperor was mounted on a coal-black
charger and wore the dark green uni
form of a colonel of foot guards with
the blue sash of the Order of Standrew
across his breast, his being by far the
most modest uniform in the imperial
procession.
EMPEROR IS CHEERED.
"General Kuropatkin is one of the
greatest soldiers. and strategists in Eu
rope. The movement which is now go
ing on is merely one of disposition of
forces. I dp not believe he approved of
the giving of battle at the Yalu River.
The policy I think he approves of is
merely to harass the enemy. until we
are ready to make a demonstration
which will be effective. In a short time
the force under Kuropatkin will be
greatly increased. Before July he will
have an army of between 450,000 and
500,000 men. Then he will be ready to
move. .
"The introduction of Chinese troops
into. Manchurian territory which has
been evacuated by Russian troops in
their withdrawal for the purpose of
strengthening their forces would have
the tendency to defeat the very purpose
of the note of Secretary Hay, in which
he sought the assistance of all the pow
ers to the principle that China should
remain neutral."
He replied: "It would seem to be
based on an assumption because the
Russian troops are falling back that
they are through with Manchuria and
that hostilities there are ended. It is
erroneous to. suppose this is a perma
nent withdrawal.
"What do you thinkof the suggestion
that Chinese troops be encouraged to
move into Manchuria and take posses
sion as. the Russian troops move out?"

Lester Gregory, Pacific Coast man
ager of the Aetna Life Insurance Com
pany of New York, testified to two In
terviews he had with* Soeder in refer
ence to a $5000 policy on the life of
Blaise, which the defendant expected
from the New York office and indenti
fied two letters written to him by Soe
der regarding the matter.
F. W. Vooght, general agent of the
Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany, testified to applications made to
his company by Soeder to insure the
life of Blaise and to the refusal of the
company to insure with a policy for
more than* $10,000. This closed the tes
timony for the day.
During the testimony the defendant
was unmoved but attentive, and only
his characteristic habit of blinking his
eyes showed nervousness. General Sal
omon, his counsel, was singularly in
dulgent in his cross-examination and
allowed the opinions of inexpert wit
nesses regarding the wounds on
Blaise's body to get into the record
without objection. All he tried to. de
velop was that the night of January
10 was damp and misty, which was
readily admitted by all the witnesses
for the prosecution. ,What bearing this
fact has on the case of the defendant
General Salomon refused to state.
"I suppose the company is afraid that
you will do up Blaise," remarked the
doctor jocularly. "You don't intend to
do that, do you?"
Soeder smiled and said: "Why, he's
my brother-in-law. We went to school
together and lived only six miles apart
in Germany. I'm not, going to harm
him."
E. H. Osbourne, a solicitor for the
Pacific Mutual Life Company, who
wrote the policy for $3000 for Blaise
and subsequently secured $7000 more in
the Hartford Life Company for him,
testified to the transactions bstween
himself and Soeder and Blaise. He had
nothing new to offer beyo/id his tes
timony at the preliminary hearing,
wherein he described the three meet
ings he had with Soeder and Blaise
and the writing of the policies of in
surance, amounting in all to $16,000.

evidently annoyed because the insur

der, "but I am afraid that the other

LOS ANGELES. May 11.â Practical
ly no business was transacted by the
Methodist General Conference to-day.
The early morning session was devoted
entirely to a consideration of the report
of the comiriittee on rules, as reported
by Rev. Dr. T. B. s Neely, chairman.
The reading and debating of the vari
ous sections governing the manner- of
transacting business on the floor of the
conference and the reference of motions
and resolutions to committees took up
the time of the conference until recess,
at which time the report was left un
finished. There were many sharp pass
ages at arms between the parliamen
tary experts, which somewhat in
livened an otherwise dull and feature
less session.
After recess, the duty of receiving
and welcoming fraternal delegates,
which was not completed at yester
day's session, was taken up, and long
addresses were made by Rev. William
Dobson, fraternal delegate from Can
ada, and Rev. John C. Kilgoe, of the
Methodist Episcopal church. South. Dr.
Dobson's address was a very able one.
Dr. Kilgoe, who is a noted pulpit ora
tor, aroused the enthusiasm of the
delegates to a degree not before
reached at the present session of the
General Conference. His eloquent per
oration, In which he asserted that no
one could love "the stars and stripes
more than the people of the South,
brought cheers from the assembly and
at the conclusion of his address the
entire audience arose at the request of
Bishop Andrews and sang "America."
Â¦ This afternoon there were several
committee meetings, the most Import
ant of which was the itinerancy and
book concern committees.

PRESIDENT'S SUMMER PXAXS
DURING OYSTER BAY VISIT
Following "him came Dr. William G.
Mizner, medical "examiner for the Pa
cific Mutual Life Insurance Company.
His was the only testimony ; that de
veloped any new fact. He told about
visiting Soeder and Blaise on two oc
casions, of having examined Blaise for
insurance " and â¢ of the refusal- of * ; the
company to grant a $10,000 policy on
.FORECASTS THE CRIME.
Detective William Armstrong, who
was sent out by the Police Department
after a telephone had been received
from Sergeant Christiansen regarding
the finding of the body of Blaise, tes
tified along the same lines as Chris
tiansen and detailed his search for a
knife in the neighborhood of the-crime.
He corroborated Christiansen as to the
position of the body and the wounds
upon it.
Deputy Coroner Charles Meehan was
the next witness. He took the dead
body of Blaise to the Morgue on a call
of the Police Department. ..He iden
tified the clothes taken from the body
and the contents of the pockets, which
consisted of a bunch of keys and a let
ter from Blaise's wife In Germany to
her husband. The trousers' pockets
were outturned when he took custody
of the body. He testified as to the fatal
wound in the neck and the two wounds
in the back of the head. ,
Mrs. Christiansen followed her hus
band and testified to the fact that
while Bitting in her kitchen on the
night of January 10, at an hour be
tween 8:30 and 8:55 she heard a man
utter an agonizing scream. The sound
came from the direction of the retain
ing wall on Taylor street. Some chil
dren from across the street were visit
ing her little ones and she sent them
home at 8:55, by which she fixed the
time. All in her home were frightened
by the, scream and the children pre
vailed on her not to go out of the
house.
William Hogan, who was the first one
to discover the body of Blaise on the
morning of January 11 of this year,
was the first witness. He told of seeing
a man- lying on the roadway between
Vallejo and Green streets, on Tay
lor street. When he approached the
body he thought it was a drunken man
and kicked it. Then he noticed that It
was lying in a pool of blood, and he
hurried to the residence of Sergeant of
Police Christiansen, at the corner of
Taylor and Green streets, where he In
formed Mrs. Christiansen that a dead
man was lying on the street. The ser
geant appeared shortly and the two
men went up the hill toward the body.
Ae they ascended the hill a well
dressed man came down the roadway,
saw the body and picked up a hat ly
ing some fifteen feet away and laid it
on the recumbent form. He remained
with the body until Sergeant Chris
tiansen and Hogan reached the place.
Then he went away.
Sergeant Christiansen's testimony was
to the same effect, but more detailed.
After he had viewed the dead body he
made a search of the neighborhood
within a circuit of 100 feet for some
weapon. He said it was apparent that
a murder had been committed. On
the wall above he found some marks
of feet that might indicate a struggle,
but he said these might have been
made by boys playing on the edge of
the cliff. The police theory is that
Blaise was murdered at the base of
the wall by Soeder, as no evidences of
blood can be found on any portion of
the retaining rockwork.
HEARS AGOXIZING SCREAMS.
THOUGHT MAX WAS DRUN'K.
All of the testimony adduced yester
day related to the finding of the body
of Blaise and the efforts of Soeder to
obtain insurance on the life of his
brother-in-law. Dr. Bacigalupl, who
performed the autopsy, was in attend
ance during the morning -session, but
was informed that he would not be
needed.
Soeder had secured insurance policies
in the sum of $16,000 on the life of
Blaise, the husband of the former's sis
ter. Blaise was brought from Germany
on a promise of remunerative employ
ment and the ultimate gain of a com
petence for his wife and children. Less
than a month elaps'ed between the ar
rival of the two men in San Francisco
and the violent death of Joseph Blaise.
Around Leon Soeder the police have
v*oren a strong web of circumstantial
evidence.
Leon Soeder, charged with murder
ing his brother-in-law. Joseph Blaise,
yesterday again faced the jury that
will determine his guilt or innocence.
Blaise's body was found at the foot of a
wall on Taylor street, between Vallejo
and Green streets, on the morning of
January 11. A gash from a knife, which
se\ered the Jugular vein, was mute
witness to the cause of death. On the
back of Blaise's head were two cuts
that were doubtless caused by* the blow
of a blunt instrument. Soeder was ar
rested for the murder because he alone
had a motive for the killing of the ig
norant German.

RUMBLE MAKES MUCH
WEALTH POCKET-MINING
For some time crooks forced to con

sohn's store and designated it as the
place where they had disposed of* a
portion of their loot, The jeweler al
ways protested innocence and swore
he had not made a purchase from a
stranger since. April of 1903. On Tues
day evening Detective Mulcahy, who
was unknown to Mendelsohn, went in
to the store a/id sold his own watch.
Yesterday mot-ning O'Dea went the^i
and in answer to a question as to
whether any purchases had been made
on the preceding day he received the
stereotyped reply that nothing had
been purchased. Mulcahy then entered
and asked to repurchase his watch.
Mendelsohn told him that it had been
sold on the previous evening. O'Dea.
who wa* waiting outside, confronted
the jeweled and the latter averred that
he had never seen Mulcahy before.
Both officers then, armed with a
search warrant, looked over the prem
ises and recovered the timepiece. Men
delsohn was booked on two charges
at the city prison â one of violating
an ordinance that requires a record to
be kept of all goods purchased and an
other of failing to report the purchase
to the chief of police.

SCHOOL TEACIIKKS SUK
FOIl HACK SALARIES
SANTA BARBARA, May 11.â The
delegates. to the school superintendents
convention have placed themselves on
record as unequivocally favoring an In
crease in the salaries of teachers in the
public schools and those of the . city
and county superintendents, and that
provision for, the increase should be
made from the State school fund. ' ,
The matter, came 'tip for discussion
last evening, but no formal action was
taken. At the opening of the morning
session- State Superintendent Kirk
brought up the subject again by the
reading of a letter from Professor Sam
uel G. Black of San Diego, who ex
pressed opinions with which nearly all
agreed. Professor Black suggested:
."If the convention,, instead, c-f at
tempting to go Into details upon the
proposed amendments^ could agree
upon some general principle and then
appoint a committee to frame a law
that will carry cut the general plan
of the convention, it would be better
than to have the convention attempt
to prepare the specific amendments."
Professor Black proposes to raise
both the State and county rates of tax
ation for school purposes. Each dis
trict, he declares, should meet certain
expenses by- imposing a district tax
each year, leaving the entire State
fund for the payment of teachers' sal
aries. "This district tax," continues
Professor Black, "could be arranged
by giving the trustees authority to,re
port to the Boards of Supervisors the
sum necessary to be raised for these
purposes without calling an election,
putting in the proviso that should the
trustees fail or neglect to do so, then
it shall be the duty of the county su
perintendents to report to Jhe Board c-f
Supervisors as to the amount neces
sary." â¢
Professor Black closed the communi
cation with the statement that he as
chairman of the committee appoint
ed by the Southern California
Teachers' Association to consider
the matter of â¢ advancing salaries,
would call upon the superintend
ents at the close of the present school
year for statistics showing the
amounts paid in the several localities
and the average cost of living in each.
Superintendent Kirk, in a discussion
of the salary matter, stated that the
r- nrgestion of drawing upon the State
fund for an Increased sum did not
meet with the approval of Governor
Pardee at the time it was submitted
several months ago. The Governor,
however, had more recently undergone
a change of opinion, expressing a de
sire -. that the superintendents and
teachers agree upon some plan that
may be considered with a view of ul
timately bringing about an increase of
salary.
The superintendents are united in the
belief that principals of schools should
receive not less than $100 a month and
that the teachers be paid not less than
$75.
A bill will be framed for presenta
tion at the next session of the State

Congressman Bell Receives
an Invitation to Ride in
the Hearst Band Wagon
The battle in the Second Congres
sional District promises to be an open,
fair 'fight on party principles. The can
didates are rarely named in advance
of the regular nomination by conven
tion. It is regarded as an accepted fact
that Bell of Xapa will be the Demo
cratic nominee and it is equally certain
that the able and eloquent Duncan E.
McKinlay will carry the standard of
ih<- Republican hosts in the district. It
if noted that the Republicans are unit
< d and enthusiastic in support of Mc-
Kinlay. They are confident that he can
redeem the district and place it again
'in the Republican column. The Sec
ond District embraces the counties of
Mendocino. Glenn. Colusa, Butte. Sut
ler, Yuba. Sacramento, Yolo, Lake,
Napa. Sonoma and Marin. In the gen
eral election of 1902 the number of votes
cast in the district for Representative
Congress was 4 3.813.
The Examiner's extended report of
the reception at Napa to Congressman
Htil caused a deal of comment and
merriment in the Democratic camp. The
Hearst bandwagon now seems larffe
enough to accommodate both Livernash
and the Democratic Congressman from
â¢.he Second District. At last accounts
Llvernash had not apologized for call
i-ng Hell's Round Valley reservation bill
a land grab, but the apology may come
before the adjournment of the Santa
Cruz convention. â¢
It Is common gossip that Judge A.
G. Burnett of Sonoma County will be
chosen chairman of the convention at
Sacramento on Wednesday, May 18.
Orrin Henderson of San Joaquin
County is spoken. of for chairman of
the Republican Stale Central Commit
tee.
Delegates to the Republican State
Convention, chosen at the primary elec
tion on Tuesday, May 3, will caucus at

Though the members of the Retail
Florists' Association met with defeat
in their efforts before the Board of
Supervisors to prevent the establish
ment of flower marts and the sale of
buds and blossoms on the streets, they
do not intend to accept the decision of
the board as final. This Is evidenced
by the filing yesterday by Frank P.
Shibeley of 311 Sutter street, a mem
ber of the association, of a suit for an
injunction permanently enjoining the
Board of Public Works from issuing
the permits to street peddlers of flow
ers. Shibeley holds that if the ped
dlers are allowed to take up three feet
of space-at the outer edge of the side
walk for a display of flowers the rights
of pedestrians will be Interfered with
in an unwarrantable manner. Shibe
ley says he is a taxpayer and a law
abiding citizen and he protests against
the alleged infringement.
The suit was assigned to Judge
Sloss. When Shibeley's attorneys pre
sented a temporary restraining order
to Sloss for his signature "the Judge
refused to sign it, holding that he
could not Issue the order on the com
plaint filed. He promised, however, to
give them a further hearing to-day.

Disheveled and tearful, her skirt torn
to shreds and her feet through the soles
of her shoes, the forlorn woman applied
this afternoon to the County Commis

children. Her husband was killed in a
mine a year ago, and she has since
made a living by raising chickens and
selling eggs.
OMAHA. Neb., May 11.â Mrs. Emma
Smith, a widow of Helena, Mont/ ar
rived in this city to-day penniless, hav
ing been put off a train in Iowa,
with her baby, after she had been
robbed of her pocketbook containing
her ticket home and 55 in silver.
Two weeks ago she started for Can
ton, Ohio, where she arrived in time to
bury her father. The expense of the
trip had consumed practically her en
tire savings. After she boarded the
train at Chicago she showed her ticket
to the conductor and went to sleep.
Early in the morning another con
ductor called for the ticket, and it was
gone, and she was put off the train.
She walked ten miles through the mud
to Missouri Valley, carrying her baby.
A freight train conductor there picked
her up and brought her to Omaha and
gave her Jl to buy food.

The recognition involves the protec
tion of this property by the United
States Government in case of need.
The Belgian stockholders, it is said, are
very desirous that the United States
shall assume this attitude toward the
road, as there is some danger that the
property may come into conflict with
the interests of sonÂ»e European nations
which are extending their spheres of
influence in China. It is said there is
precedent for the manner of action de
cided on in the case of the Panama
Railroad Company, organized under an
American charter, but the control of
%vhich passed into French hands for a
term of years, notwithstanding which
our Government regarded it as an
American corporation.
WASHINGTON. May 11.â The ad
ministration has concluded to continue
to recognize the Canton railroad .as an
American institution notwithstanding
the fact that a majority of the stock
of the corporation recently passed into
the hands of Belgian capitalists. This
company was organized under the laws
of New Jersey and a majority of the
original stock was held in this country.
The line Is to run from Canton to Han
kow and will connect with the railroad
from Peking. It is understood that
about ten miles of road have, been con
structed.
Protection Will Be Given

OAKLAND. May 11â If there is one thing
on earth about which there is a h&lo of. never
lessening Interest It is a weddingâ Â«spÂ«clally
whtn the wedding is of two clever and popular
young people. The nuptials of Miss Ella
Goodall and Dr. Cfcarles Miner Cooper this
evening were' of more than ordinary interest.
Not only because the wedding was a brilliant
social event, but because the bride" Â¦ family Is
kite wn 'the length and breadth of the Pacific
Coast, her father. Edwin Goodall. being a
member of the pioneer steamship firm of
G<<Kiall. Perkins & Co.
The bride is an only daughter axd an un
usually charming girl, vivacious. aa*omplishs<3
and cultur-d. having spent much of her time |
in travel abroad. <
About two hundred guests witnessed the
ceremony this evening, the Invitations having
been limited to relatives and intimate friends.
TtH? appointments of the wedding were un
usually elaborate, especially the floral decora
tions which were, however, in excellent taste.
The 'stairway and hall Â»tÂ« festooned with
garlands and empire wreaths of laurel. whl:e
In the rear drawing-room was a glowing mass
of golden and purole Iris.
The prettiest spot and the cÂ«nter of at
traction was the great round window In thÂ«
front drawing-room, which had been trans
formed into a rustic bower. Boughs of haw
thorn lined the window and interlaced their
blossom-ladea branches overhead. A low.
runic weed railing formed a gateway and
gave a pleasing rural touch to the- picture.
Within this bower the bride and groom
pledped their troth and received the nuptial
becediction of Rev. C. R. Brown, pastor of
the First Congregational Church.
It is impossible to do justice to the beauty
of the bride's sown â it can only, be described
an exquisite combination of chiffon cloth
and carraKh ma cress lace. thÂ« berthe and
flounce* sleeves being of the rar* old Irish
lace. A tulle v*ll covered the bride" Â¦ dark
hair and the brtdal bouquet waj a shower cf
white orchids and lilies of the valley.
Mrs. W. H. Skene of Portland. Or., was
a charming matron of honor in a gown Â©I
pink embroidered creD*. She carried aa
annTull of pink American Beauty roaes. .
One of the prettiest features of the bridal
procession was Â»;e_n In th* six little flower
bearers. Dressed - in the daintiest of white
frocks and bearing garlands of Duchess rose*,
the sextet of little girls â Helen Goodall.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
The present action looks to reach
them in another way. Joseph Folcia
and W. Grondona own a tract of land
in West Oakland upon which they al
low dumping. The injunction is asked
for to restrain them and about forty
scavengers from using these grounds
for this purpose. It is set forth that
the decaying of vagetable and animal
matter is a menace to the health of the
community, and if the injunction Is
granted this will stop the dumping of
garbage within the city limits.
A writ of injunction has been asked
for restraining the scavengers of the
city from dumping garbage 'within the
city limits. Suit to this end was begun
this afternoon by Health Officer von
Adelung and is a step toward putting
the scavengers out of business. The
city has given the Pacific Incinerating
Company a monopoly of the garbage
business in consideration of the fact
that a crematory be established. An
ordinance was passed making it un
lawful to dump garbage inside the city.
Notwithstanding this, the scavengers
have continued to do business, and
after a score or more of them had been
arrested prosecutions were discon
tinued.

Blanket Injunction Asked
For to Restrain Scavengers
From Operating in City
After hearing the testimony Judge
Melvln said that while the girl was not
of a$e he believed that the husband
had the prior right to the care of the
girl and ordered the father to let her
go. Aa soon as John Bamber, the
father, stepped outside the courtroom
he was arrested by a deputy constable
on the complaint of Attorney Russell
on a charge of disturbing the peace.
The forcible abduction of Jeanie De
souza, a 17-year-old wife, by her father,
and the hearing of the habeas corpus
proceedings instituted by John Desouza
this afternoon, developed the fact that
the girl is a prospective heiress. The
dramatis personae include a young
country girl, Jeanie Bamber, from
Guerneville, who falls in love with a
waiter, John Desouza, and marries
him. She has a rich grandmother by
the name of Catherine Griffin, who lives
in Santa Rosa, and who promises to
leave the girl her money. The girl tells
her story to two attorneys, who secure
a contract from her to get her estate
for her when her gradmother dies for
one-half the property. She thinks the
matter over and believes she has made
a bad bargain. She tells her story to
Private Detective Erwin Frost, who
finds the girl's father and helps him
abduct the girl and lock her up in a
room for two nights. They are forced
to bring- the the girl into court to-day
and she is released from the custody
of the father and given back to her
husband. v
The hearing of the matter this after
noon filled the courtroom with attor
neys. Jeanie Desouza, the stolen girl,
was placed on the stand and told how
her father came to her home with
Detective Frost and took her in a
buggy io Frost's office, at 55 Broadway.
That night the father slept in the same
room with the girl ln Order to see that
she did not run away. The next night
they went to the Hotel Touraine and
the father rocked his daughter in her
room and kept the key.
John Bamber testified that he and his
Â¦wife had separated in 1SS7, six weeks
after their marriage, and the girl in
court was the issue of that union. He
said that he had always been willing
to take carepf the child, but when the
mother died several years later he con
sented to the grandmother keeping the
child. Within the last month he heard
that his daughter was living a vaga
bond life and he came here to get pos
session of her*. He said that she would
not be IS years of age until May *2,
and that he had never given his con
sent to her marriage.

tempt of the Government of Salvador
to reopen the claim matter, after refus
ing to. accept the arbitration award A
settlement was effected on the basis of
a payment of $42S,OO0 to the Salvador
Commercial Company. The three
counts total $100,000
Item two of the complaint recites
that Colonel Irish was retained by the
Salvador Commercial Company to rep
resent it in negotiations with the Sal
vador Government. Colonel Irish avers
ihat he caused the claim finally,
through a treaty between the United
States and Salvador, to be submitted to
a court of arbitration, composed of the
Right Honorable Sir Henry Strong,
uhivf Justice of Canada; Senor Dr. Don
Jose Koca Pacas, Salvador's Minister
to the United States, and Hon. Don M
Dickinson. United States Minister to
balrndor. This" commission found for
i he ?* h l ador Commercial Company for
Colonel John P. .Irish has filed suit in
the Superior. court against the Salvador
Commercial Company to recover $100,
000 alleged to be due for services ren
dored the company in a successful con
test to gain nearly $500,000 from the
Government of Salvador for seizure of
El Trifuno Company's properties, in
which the Commercial Company was
chief stockholder. On petition of
colonel Irish the Union National bank
has bt?en temporarily restrained from
disposing of bonds and certificates the
bank holds as trustee for the Salvador
Commercial Company pending the liti
gation. Judge Ellsworth made that or
der to-day. Colonel Irish's counsel is
uiney & Olney.
Colonel Irish's suit grows out of a
failure to effect a satisfactory settle
ment with the Salvador Commercial
Company for his work in negotiations
over the corporation's claim against
Salvador. This company pressed its
demands for damages out of the seiz
ure and confiscations of valuable
concessions, frachises and other rights
granted to- El Trifuno Company, which
were to develop enormous shipping and
other interests in Salvador. The Com
mercial Company, holding the chief in
terest, it is averred, employed Colonel
Irish in 18S9 to present its claims
against Salvador before the State De
partment of the United States and to
pracure its intervention in behalf of
Colonel Irish's clients. This, his com
plaint alleges, was done, and the serv
ice, he declares, requiring high skill
and knowledge, was worth $25,000.

111S Broadway, May 11.
Dr. C. La Verna Carvin, the young
meaical graduate of the University of
Michigan, who was acquitted yester
day ori a charge of " practicing medi
cine without a license, has opened flre
on the State Board of Medfcal Exam
iners. She "has selected Dr. Dudley
Tait, president of the board, as the
first target in her Contest.
Dr. Carvin to-day directed her at
torney. E. M. Gibson.' to file a suit for
$10,000 damages against Dr. Tait for al
leged malicious prosecution. The young
woman eays this suit will speedily be
followed by an action to compel the
State Board of Medical Examiners to
grant her application for an examina
tion, that a license to practice . medi
cine may be issued to her.
The suit will be directed against ur.
Tait, who swore to the complaint as
president of the State Board of Medi
cal Examiners, upon which Dr. Carvin
-,vas prosecuted in the Police Court.
In accordance with his client's instruc
tions Attorney Gibson has begun the
preparation of papers. The attorney
said the suit would be filed to-morrow
in the Superior Court.- Â¦ -
"Following this litigation, said At
torney Gibson, "we expect to find a way
to re*ach the State Board, which has
refused to allow Dr. Carvin to take
the examination, although she is a
graduate from one of the leading medi
cal colleges of the United States, name
ly the University of Michigan Medical
Department. , "
"Dr. Tait swore to a complaint di
rectly charging Dr/ Carvin with prac
ticing medicifae without a license. \ve
say he had 'no right to swear to tne
complaint because he was not In a
position to know of his own knowledge
that it was true. He relied entirely
upon statements â¢ of a- hired spy. a.
woman, and that is entirely insufficient.
We denounce the arrest of Dr. Carvin
as outrageous and the prosecution aa
a disgrace. Dr. Carvin-.- as the evidence
clearly showed yesterday, had follow
ed to the letter every preliminary re
quirement-of the State Board ?ouch
ing her application for a license. She
had deposited her examination lee of
520 and had been told that everything
would be'all rieht. â¢ 'he had not ac
cepted a penny for fees and was wait
ing" for the examination day, when her
arrest came." ' . - Â¦. - *
Dr. Carvin declared positively that
Dr. â¢ George G. Gere, secretary of the
State Board, told her that in case any
complaint were made at the office no
attention would be paid to it as she
had met all of the requirements pend
ing the date of holding the examina
tion.

The motto of this evening ia expressive of
the nin-.s and objects of our work and pur
poses. Our motto this evening is "Progress,"
and rrcjrrey* is what has always cumulated
our ambition as merchants and citizens of
this glorious country, of this progressive
State and of this growing city.
And I am Klad to be able to ctate, in the
name of our entire membership, before the
chief magistrate of our State and before the
father of our city, thai the Merchants' Ex
change has contributed net only to the ma
terial growth, but also to the moral progress
of Oakland. The exchange has helped to bring
Oakland business men to a better under-
Ftanding with each other and to a closer re
lationship.
' The Merchants' Exchange of Oakland has
ajready paesed through its trial period. Its
position is a permanent one. and any one who
haÂ» heard its voice or has 'read of its enter
prise must regard it as an indispensable In
stitution to the welfare of Oakland.
As president of this institution 1 wish to
put particular stre<Â«s on the statement that
our ambitions and work are not selfish. We
simply strive' to become a benefiting factor
in the promotion of Oakland's common good
and in the progress of Oakland's general in
terests. It ia our ambition to help to bring
Oakland to the front, not only among Amer
ica's progressive business cities, but also
among America's wideawake and enlightened
communities.
PRESIDENT GIER'S REPORT.
After the service of the menu Past
President Theo. Gier read his report for
the year past, which was in part as
f ollo-ws :
Oentlemen: At the close of another year in
the history of the Merchants' Exchange, I feel
that I can truthrully soy that It has t*en the
niost s>ucxessiui ana useiul year that we have
k::own. At our !.Â«Â»( annual meeting we looked
Krward with a great deal of hope to all that
might be accomplished during the coming year.
To-night I feel that not only have we accom
lliibeo All that wÂ« anticipated, but that we
fchve done even better. Several important mat
ter* havs been taktn up by our exchange and
have been carried to a successful conclusion,
end other matters of which we had no thought
at that time are now under your direction be
ing cartd tor in the most gratifying way.
One or the most gratifying tasks carried to
a successful conclusion by the Merchants' Ex
change is the completion and opening of the
tunnel road into our .sister county. This work
has engaged our attention for some years, but
with a tenacity worthy of the cause; your ex
change has stuck to its task and Â¦finally ac
|,ci>mx>Ushed everything that It started out to
i do. It 1* proper at this time to express our
, thanks to Supervisor RoÂ«*Â«, who worked so
i hard on this side, and to Mr. Stowe, who did
equally gi>od service on the Contra Costa side.
For several years past this exchange has
na4e it its duty and. although a hard onf.
none the less pleasing, to carry out a fitting
celebration on the Fourth of July. Last year
| the demonstration on the national holiday wn
j a!l that It shuuld be, and I have no doubt that
this year we shall again succeed in bringing
many thousands of people to our rapidly de
veloping city and Impressing upon them the
fact that we are still going ahead building for
all that will help the making of Greater Oak
land.
Last fall, at a time when circumstances
were decidedly against us because of the late
riwt of the date at which the affair was held,
we prepared and maintained a most creditable
county exhibit at the State Fair at Sacra
n.ento and succeeded in carrying ofT third pnzÂ»
in the contest for the best county exhibit. This
was doubly gratifying because of the difficul
ties under which the exhibit was prepared. "V\>
were aided substantially In this effort by the
Supervisors, and the report of Qur special
rceetinj to ths .County Board of Supervisors
was characterized a* beinp most satisfactory.
The Merchants' Exchange is now engaged In
cuptrtntendtng at the World's Fair at St.
Ixjuis the most representative exhibit ever sent
from Alameda County. More than a year ago
your exchange undertook to agitate the ne
cessity cf and to undertake the carrying out
so far as lay within its -power of the improve
ment of Telegraph avenue. Much personal
work was done by your secretary and by In-'
dividual' members of the exchange. Interesting
rroperty owners, overcoming protests and en
couraging in every way this great work 1
am pleased to be able to report that at this
time m A *t of the contracts have been let for
Improving this important highway, which con
nects Oakland with the State University, and
that much of the preliminary work has been
done.
I cannot, however, close these remarks
without jnyirg a f*w wt>rtls on the tremendous
Impetus with which Oakland Is now pressing
forward In her commercial and civic career.
It needs but a casual glance to prove that
there was never anything like the amount of
building going en in this city that there Is to
day â perhaps there was never half so much
going on tt one time. And yet we have not
sufficient residences to accommodate the new
people that are flocking Into our city. This
development Is not confined to any particular
section â It is general: It extenrts from the bay
to Frultvale. and from the foothill* to the wa
ter front. AH of this acttvlty has stimulated
every branch of trade, and I may say that en
the whole Oakland ts as prosperous to-day as
ar.y city !n the Union. Nor Is there anything
to suggest that this prosperity will not con
tlr.ue. for years to ccme.
The Merchants' Exchange and â¢Â¦.<â¢ Oakland
Board of Trade are eo-orÂ«ermtlnr to carry out
a fitting welcome next week to the first Santa
Fe train to come to our city. The making of
its terminus In Oakland by this great trans
continental system lÂ» an event of importance.
It will give Oakland prefttire and w-Ui raiÂ«* Its
value as a commercial center throughout the
entire cocntry. Several of our directors are
or. the exerutlv* committee of thla celebration,
and I Tcost earnestly rajyest every mÂ»mber
of your exchanre and everv citizen of Oakland
tÂ» do everything within their power to make
this occasion worthy of the event which has
called it forth.
A few weeks aco we voted to issue school
bonds acd we are Â»oen to have an opportunity
to vote CTi a bond Issne for eeneral Improve
ments. It should fc* our duty to supocrt any
legitimate bond proposition that will- assist
in the develorment of cor city.

Darby Martin, who bid $1730 on a lot
of old junk belonging to the city and
afterward regretted it, was released
from his bid yesterday by the Board of
Public Works on his agreeing to forfeit
his deposit of $100. The money was
confiscated by the board, who will ask
the Supervisors for authority to sell the
junk.
The Bureau of Streets was directed
to investigate the complaint of C. R.
Pechin, principal of the Rincon Gram
mar School, regarding the bad condi
tion of Vassar place.
The Board of Election Commission
ers occupied the time of the Finance
Committee of the Supervisors all yes
terday morning in going over the ex
pense accounts of the last year and
explaining the necessity for the pro
posed expenditure during the current
year.
The total amount asked for by the
t:iection Commissioners is $122,556, $5000
of which is to cover the salaries of the
Commissioners; $2400 for the Regis
trar's salary; $37,000 for the deputies;
$17,750 for the expenses of the coming
precinct registration; $12,606 for the
primary elections; $46,300 for the-gener
al elections, and $1500 for incidental
and sundry expenses. In addition to
these amounts they ask for $5000 for
erecting new booths, $10,000 for bond
election and $11,000 for an auxiliary
water supply!
The entire morning was taken up in
going over the figures and everything
was found satisfactory until the ques
tion of salaries was brought up by
Commissioner Voorsanger. A^oorsanger
said that for two months prior to elec
tions there are at least seventy men
working in the Registrar's office and
that the regular office pay roll is raised
from â¢ $18,900 to $33,700. Supervisor
Brandenstein, Who was in, the chair,
asked if,, the men employed tempor
arily were civil' service men.. .
Registrar Adams said they were not,
and- a heated " discussion between Su
pervisor Brandenstein and Devotoof
the commission followed.
"Why did you not engage civil ser
vice men?" asked Brandenstein. /
- "Because we havt; , found that their
services are unsatisfactory."
Â¦ "But" by what right did you employ
these men, contrary to the charter,
wkichi' provides that all deputy regis
trars be chosen from the civil service
list?" ..
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF WORDING.
"We base our claim upon the broad
meaning of the, charter. The clause
referring to the appointment of civil
service men in % our office is unconsti
tutional." :
| "What is your objection to the civil
service system, Mr. Devoto?" *
yi have no objection' to it."
. '.'Then-why didn't you do all in your
power to see that none but civil service
mefuwere appointed?"
"Because. the other member^ of^the
board, wanted it the other way."
'Â¦ ,"I; think," interposed : Commissioner
'Roberts,; "that Mr. -Brandenstein is
casting insinuations upon the honesty
of the Board of Election Commissioners
and* that he ' has far 1 surpassed, the
bounds of his jurisdiction."
. Brandenstein* replied that ' he was
yery' sorry to -see that the conditions
were marching back furiously to the
old days. He explained, however, that
he : was merely investigating the re
quirements of ithe various departments
and that he .must do bo :even > to the
great" displeasure of his. fellow politi

The last named jurists state that
Mahoney has left his office and that
his successor has been installed. Such
being the case, the taxpayer can get
no relief as the election has- been held
and the money he sought to save has
been - spent. The question then is
"purely abstract and moot." The ac
tion is dismissed in the following
words:- "The demands of actual prac
tical litigation are too pressing, to per
mit the examination, or discussion of
academic -questions such as this case
in its present situation presented." For
how long a term are San Francisco's
county officers elected is a question not
yet settled.
About a year ago it became appar
ent to Mahoney and his masters fthat
there was no chance of re-election.
There had been many disputes between
members of the. legal, fraternity as to
whether the County Clerk's term
should be of two or four years. It
occurred to Mahoney or some of hla
confreres that if the case should be
brought to the attention of the courts
a decision might be secured in favor
of the proposition that the county offi
cials should hold offie'e for four years.
Richard Bradley, a taxpayer, there
fore brought suit to restrain the elec
tion commission from proceeding with
its preparations for the election of No
vember, 1903. The plaintiff's plea was
that unnecessary expense would be en
tailed by holding biennial instead of
quadrennial elections. Able attorneys
were secured and civil case fees,
amounting to a considerable sum, were
paid before the matter was finally
brought to : the attention of the Su
preme Court. The court , passed the
case to the commissioners. Â¦! ;.; '.:. :.":Â¦â¢
The Supreme Court sent Ex-County
Clerk Mahoney a rare specimen of ji
legal gold brick from Sacramento yes
terday. It cost a considerable amount
of money at that. The court decides
that Mahoney is no longer County
Clerk, but neglects to state whether
he is entitled to the position or wheth
er the term of office should be two or
/our years. Many public officials were
awaiting the court's decision in this
matter and yesterday afternoon when
the result of the litigation became
known, there * was much laughter at
the erudite joke of the State's highest
tribunal.

Supervisor Braunhart arrived late'
but just in time to hear a discussion on
the employment of non-civil | service
service men. He joined in vigorously
and maintained that the Board of Edu
cation, having willfully broken the lay.
should not- be allowed to employ any
men other than teachers and those con
nected with educational matters, and
that all other, men, such as painters
and carpenters, should be employed
by the Board of Works. '.;:/>
The trouble arose through the testi
mony of Inspector of Schools Me-
Sheehy, who said that of the eighteen
men under him, there are several who
are not civil service men. â¢
School Director Roncovieri testified to
the effect that at the time the men
were employed, there were no eligible
carpenters or painters on the civil serv
ice list, and that the youngest painter
on the list was more than 62 years of
age.. He was known as "the Kid" and
was too old to climb a ladder.
The meeting adjourned and the mat
ter was taken under advisement.

WIFE'S SISTERâ P. N., City. The
English law that prohibits a man
from marrying his deceased wife's
sister is: Elizabeth Cap I. which rec
ognizes the Levitlcal degree as gov
erning marriages. These degrees are
set forth in various chapters of Levit
icus. The verse bearinc on marriage
with a wife's sister is Leviticus xviii.
18. These rules were followed by
church and Court and accepted, by
them. The chief argument In favor
of repealing the Elizabethan' act is
that the interpretation of , the verse
referred to Is wrong, for the verse for
bids a man to taka his wife's sister to
wife during the_. first wife's lifetime.
The limitation expressed in the verse
is ignored in the law.
A son of Joseph Chamberlain, on inquiry bent, has
come among us, scrutinized our political theory, and

haustion exclaims that he can neither understand us nor

ing visitor. Remain with us a little longer, choose your
company with discretion and learn that neither bluff,
bjuster nor buncombe counts true in the good will of the
American people' even in politics. % f
The Board of Supervisors is still talking of the ne
cessity of remodeling our theaters to reduce the danger
of fire and panic which lurks in most of them as a
menace to thousands of lives. It is many months since
the Chicago horror forced this matter into public notice
and still nothing has been done. The Supervisors should
stop talking. Every word they utter now on the subject
is an indictment of their neglect arid apparent contempt
of the welfare -of the public.
Native pearl fishers in the Gulf of
Panama and the Gulf of Mexico al
ways carry a long, keen-edged knife
in a leather belt when they go down
into the water, and they are ready at
any moment to make a desperate fight
for life. Unless taken unawares, the
chances are that they will come off
victorious.
"Many a fight have I had with the
shark, senor," said Juan Encisco, one
of the oldest and best of the Mexican
divers, "and only once have I been
bitten. That was when I was a young
man, unused to the business and ner
vous. If a man is quick at dodging
in -the water and keeps his knife
handy he need not be afraid of a
shark. Usually sharks are too timid
to attack a diver â but not always,
especially If the diver happens to
come down on them when they are
chasing a school of fish.
"Some divers wait for the shark to
turn on his- back and then rip open
his belly as he comes up through the
water to "seize them. I never do that;
it is too risky. I always swim under
an enemy and cut him open before
he has time to attack me. The shark
is a very slow fish in the water and a
good .diver can swim and dodge
all around him. .

PLAID â A. O. S.. City. Plaid, pro
nounced plade, not plad. has no ref

word is commonly used to express
such. In Popular Ballads the" editor
says In the glossary to his work: "This

language of which I have any knowl

and when applied to a plaid or blanket
signifies simply a broad, plain, uni

brechan or plaid consists of twelve or
thirteen yards of narrow stuff wrapped
round the middle and reaches to the
knees."

Sharing her husband's tastes for a
country life, and aiming in all things
10 be a companion to him, Mrs. Car

eociety and, save when dispensing the

Probably few persons apart from
the Carnegies' intirr.ates realize how
much the Laird of Skibo is assisted by
biÂ£ wife in working out the details of
his various schemes. Some of them
are said to be suggested in the first !

â¢ Although an American woman, Mrs. !
Carnegie is almost as enthusiastic as !
her husband In her admiration for j
Scotland and things Scottish, and finds ;
an outlet for her artistic tastes In j
embelHFhinpr her residences here and ]
in America with those decorative
ffhemes and ornamental devices which
impart to them a distinctive Scottish
atmosphere.
Among the recreations in which she
delights almost equally with Mr. Car
negie is golf, and the vigorous exercise
she thus obtains accounts in no small
.measure for the excellent health she
enjoys. The Carnegie golfing box at
Cnauncey, near the famous links of the
St. Andrew's Golf Club in Scotland,
was designed by her and first led to
the discovery that she possessed rare ;
architectural talents which she has
since been at some pains to cultivate.
Mrs. Carnegie is an ardent believer
in her husband's doctrine that the pos

.obligation to help others rise above 'Â¦
the obstacles of poverty to careers of
usefulness and happiness. Probably, ;
-however, she would hardly subscribe
to his declaration, made, by the way,
before he was married, that "the man
who dies rich dies disgraced," for it
is certain that their one child. Mar
garet, will never be left dependent on
her own exertions for a living. But
it is well known that Mrs. Carnegie
has more than once avowed her pur
pose of doing her best to train her
daughter to- spend money wisely, that
others may profit by it, and not de
vote it to indulgence in selfish luxur
ies. Apart from participation in her
husband's charities, Mrs. Carnegie de

finds that marriage is not included in
his scheme. The two are in a mountain
pass and imagine themselves alone.
Sunday has her hand on her revolver
and is ready to shoot down the man
who has insulted her in such deadly
fashion when there is a report, and the
man falls, the victim . of the gun of
one of Sunday's four protectors, who
has overheard the interview and taken
it upon himself to avenge the girl. The
body is buried and the incident closed.
Then, through circumstances which
need not be described in detail, this
Western girl is taken to England by a
woman of title and Introduced in so
ciety there. Eventually she finds her
self a guest at the baronial hall of a
certain Colonel Brinthon>, who she dis
covers Is the brother of the man whom
her foster-parent, Towzer, had shot.
Colonel Brinthorp loves Sunday and
she returns his love, but in a morbid
way she considers herself the cause of
his brother's death, and so she repulses
him, and, unwilling to explain her at
titude, puts England behind her and re
turns to her first home â Silver Creek.
But Colonel Brinthorp follows, and one
night turns up in the little cabin
where Sunday and her four protectors
are sitting In the twilight, the girl try
ing to respond to the men's cheerful
ness. Brinthoro begs Sunday to marry
him, and she responds by telling him
the story of his brother's death, but
leaves the inference that he died by
her revolver. Towzer, however, hastens
to clear uo the situation by confessing
that it was he who shot the English
man. The end is prettily pathetic. In
the gloom of the cabin room it is im
possible to see from Colonel Brinthorp's
face what effect the revelations have
bad ui>on him. But evidently Sunday
has no doubt. Sadly she picks up her
candle and going up to each of her
j friends says "Good-night," but when
she turns to. the man she loves it is
"Good-by, Colonel Brinthorp." But the
man rises and says, "Good-night, Sun
day," and the curtain falls.

takes a good sized drink of whisky and
walks out and over to his shop. There
he writes a notice in his own language
conveying to the world the fact that
the little brown men have been once
more successful in battle. This no
tice he pastes in his window and to
each and every customer who comes
in during the day he explains its
meaning.
The other morning he waited on the
steps of his little shop as usual, made
his usual purchase of a morning pa
per and his usual rush to his friend
the "barkeep." .
"Japs win?" he asked before he was
fairly within the saloon, and without
giving his friend a chance to look at
the paper.
"No, lose 'em," replied the saloon
man, thinking to tease the little fel
low.
The cobbler almost fell to the floor
the shock was so great. He looked
at the barkeeper, burst Into what was
evidently profanity in the language of
the Japs and ran out of the place. He
took the first car that came along
bound downtown. That* night the
bartender went to the Hall of Justice
in answer to a summons from a friend
of his and put up $5 to get the disap
pointed and very much intoxicated lit
tle brown man out of jail.
THE Board of Supervisors are now busy preparing
the budget of municipal expenses for the ensuing
year. This budget is based upon an estimate made
by the Auditor of the expenditures of the city and county
government for the next ensuing year. The Auditor, in
making this statement, specifies the amount required to
meet the interest and sinking funds for all outstanding
funded debts and the wants of all the departments of the
municipal government, and he also estimates the amount
of income to be 'derived by the-city from fines, licenses
and other sources of revenue, exclusive of taxes upon
property and the probable amount required to be levied
and raised by taxation.
After the Supervisors have determined the amount re
quired to pay the expenses of conducting the public busi
ness of the city and county for the next ensuing year
and thus determined the amount required to be raised by
taxation they must then proceed to levy the taxes for
the ensuing year.
Owing to the rapid gro'wth of the city the necessity for
larger Police and .Fire departments and the increased ex
penditures that are necessarily required in all the depart
ments of the city, government the taxes for the next year
will be as high as the law will permit.
Notwithstanding this an effort is being made to have
the Supervisors include in this budget a sum large enough
to construct'and equip a modern electric road on Geary
street.. - a / :
This cannot be done without taking the money from
the estimated expenses of running the various depart
ments of the city government. It cannot be done except
at the expense of the schools, streets and sewers, the
Police and Fire departments.
The charter provides that a public utility cannot be
paid for by the city and county out of its annual rev
enues unless these annual revenues are sufficient to pay
for this public utility in addition to the other necessary
expenditures of the city and county. The Board of Su
pervisors have twice declared by ordinance that the cost
of this particular public utility is too great to be paid
out of % the ordinary annual income and revenue of the
city and county, and therefore have twice submitted to
the people the question of determining whether they
would authorize the issuance of bonds in order thereby
to raise the money for this purpose. At both elections
the electors voted against the proposal.
If the people had indorsed these bonds payment would
have been extended over a period of forty years; but
even this mode of payment for this public utility was
twice rejected at the polls. To attempt now to impose
this entire burden upon thetax payers of the city at one
time, and take this entire amount, which was then esti
mated at $750,000, out of the pockets of the tax payers
in one year, and only then by curtailing the usefulness
of probably every other department of the city govern
ment, would be an outrage upon the entire community.
The tax payers of San Francisco at this time, when the
city is developing rapidly and splendidly and is more and
more attracting the attention of the world, are willing
and anxious that all proper demands from the various de
partments for increased income for the ensuing year
should be granted by the Board of Supervisors. They
want to see their city well managed, well policed and
amply protected from fire. They are not willing that the
usefulness of a single department of the city government
be impaired for want, of income in order to try an experi
ment in municipal ownership which has in one year been
twice rejected by them at the polls.
THE NEW BUDGET.
Another important document, upon which in the law's
devious course the distribution of more than a million
dollars may depend, is missing from the County Clerk's
office and everybody in authority is in blissful, careless
ignorance of where the paper may be. When the law
assumes to govern the affairs of the living ajnd of the
dead it should also assume the responsibility of absolute
protection. Criminal proceedings against the careless
might prove a corrective.

San Francisco, May 11, 1904. a
Editor San Francisco Call â Dear Sir:
In response to your editorial under the
head of "Automobillng" in this morn
ing's issue of your esteemed paper. I
would like to have you publish the
following, viz.:
The sport of auto'mobiling is at
present undergoing the same troubles
in introduction into our parks as the
bicycles had in their early days. We
all can remember the great prejudice
created against the "scorcher" by his
own reckless riding. Of course, the
same is now true of the reckless auto
mobilisL There is no reason, how
ever, why the many innocent ones
should suffer because of the faults of
a few bad ones. The accident which
recently occurred in Golden Gate Park
was caused by reckless handling of a
good machine in the hands of a man
who had already had one accident and
had not profited by that experience.
He tried to make a difficult turn in
the road while going at a too high rate
of speed, and it is a well known fact
in professional automobile circles that
he was racing at the time of the ac
cident. A day or two after this acci
dent a youthful (and therefore irre
sponsible) chauffeur ran his machine
over the bank of the Ocean boulevard.
Both of these accidents were caused
by improper handling of the ma
chines. No one was to blame for
these accidents save the men who
were operating the machines at the
time.
If the park were properly illuminat
ed, as was the original intention of
the Park Commissioners, the license
number on the different machines
could be detected as well by night as
they could by day and a mounted po
liceman, would not have to give chase
to automobiles, but simply note the
number and could, the next day, swear
out a warrant for the arrest of the
holder of such license.
In Defense of the Automobile.

just as he came up to the surface of

One part of Mr. Hearst's article is to be highly com
mended, for he admits that Christianity has merits while
declaring that very few work at it. After all, he thinks
that it teaches "abstract unselfishness," while he insists
that: "If some able man will give a great boom to the
theory of reincarnation, making every man" believe that
a few years will perhaps find him in the place of the most
unfortunate of mortals we may get results." We are
charmed with the modesty of this. Is not Mr. Hearst
already booming reincarnation and is he not an able man?
Behind his article is a deep political significance that
far outruns the tenacious purpose of Mr. Bryan. He is
desirous of achieving the Presidency. If he can't get it
in his present body/ which his campaign biography as
sures us is six feet long, forty years old and of command
ing aspect, he proposes to keep it up by dodging into the
bodies that stand in line for the office.
When the ticket sales open for a first night at the opera
it is the custom of the offensive plutocrats, referred to by
Mr. Hearst, to hire messenger boys to hold places in the
line for them that they may secure seats. Mr. Hearst
lives and learns. He proposes to achieve the Presidency
now, if possible; if not, with a perseverance that outruns
that of the saints, he proposes to have an option through
all the future as tenant in the body of some one who is
near the prize.
The gentlemen who run his headquarters here will
hope for the same indefinite continuance. Mr. Tarpey
has probably already staked out the managerial form in
which he will reappear to run that distant campaign. .It
is undoubtedly Mr. Hearst's view that "when he makes
that far try for the honor Barry and Leake will either be
scrubbing offices as char-women or catching cold in de
collette dress as the jaded leaders of fashion. -
AFTER his second defeat Mr. Bryan said "They,"
meaning the wicked Democratic reorganizes,
"are not going to get rid of me. I am young, ex
pect to live a long time and will always have something
to do "Â»ith politics." That projected trouble far into the
future, but after all limited it to the brief tenure of one
life.
Mr. Hearst is the logical successor to Mr. Bryan and is
seeking the Presidency by methods that are, in a cer
tain sense, an improvement on those of Mr. Bryan, who
made money running for the Presidency while Mr.
Hearst is spending it. Mr. Bryan said that his two can
didacies improved his earning power. Mr. Hearst's can
didacy has greatly improved his spending power. In the
midst of all his activities as a candidate Mr. Hearst finds
time to write editorials for his several newspapers, and
recently has served notice on the public that he may have
something to do with politics for an indefinitely pro
longed period.
This editorial is on the subject of the transmigration of
the soul, its repeated reincarnations in a job lot of
bodies and its recurrent revisiting of the glimpses of the
moon. This doctrine of metempsychosis is an old, a ven
erable, doctrine. Mr. Hearst writes about it with the
zeal and enthusiasm of a recent convert. He prefers it
to what he calls "the Jewish conception of Heaven." He
reminds the man who has got rich out of public utilities,
such as railroads, that when he dies and loses a grip on
his soul, which "going out of the back door may re
enter at the front door" in the body of some hectic and
underfed person, perhaps destined to be run over and
smashed up on his own railroad. Rich women are also
warned to look out lest they get a ticket on this everlast
ing round trip that will r.Â»ake them the tenant of the body
of some worker in a sweat shop.
But the most interesting part of Mr. Hearst's belief in
reincarnation is the statement that very wicked men
are especially punished in his system of waking up some
fine morning to find themselves sentenced to a long term
in the body of a woman. We are surprised at tins. Why
does Mr. Hearst regard lovely woman as a sort of San
Quentin or Sing Sing? In the name of that fairest and
finest fleshly tabernacle of the soul we protest against
this. In the first place no lady likes to think that she is
inhabited by the coarse soul of a bad man,' or a good one
cither. She wants her own and should have It at what
ever cost. We are sure that all right thinking men will
stand picket to prevent such an unutterably unpleasant
case of housebreaking as it would be to let some porch
climbing and burglarious male soul, with an appetite for
whisky and tobacco, break into such fair and unmerited
quarters.
No doubt Mr. Hearst, pressed for an explanation of his
theory, will insist that the advocates of woman suffrage
are ladies who have the misfortune to have concealed
about them the souls of repeaters and ward healers. He
would insist that Miss Shaw is probably tenanted by Cap
tain Isaiah Rynders, and that Tweed is addressing legis
latures in behalf of suffrage as some fair young thing
who feels a mission to vote and is urged on by the dis
embodied chief of Tammany. Of course Mr. Hearst's
blameless and beautiful life is the result of his determi
nation not to have to wear corsets and hold up his skirts
in his next reincarnation.
Continuing Mr. Hearst carries^ his doctrine into the
probate court by declaring that the selfish plutocrat who
leaves his money to his two or three children, "tying up
his fortune to keep.it from the" mass of the people,"
would do quite differently if he realized that he was like
ly to be a gutter snipe as soon as the undertaker had
flourished his melancholy screw driver over his coffin for
the last time.
"Yep," replies the bartender, glanc
ing hastily at the paper. "Kill lots
Russians."
"Good; much good," the cobbler
shouts, laughing heartily and caper
ing about in front of the bar. Then
he places a 10-cent piece on the bar,
"Japs win?" he asks, his little eyesj
snapping and his hands trembling
with suppressed emotion.
Out in the Mission is a little cobbler
shop presided over by a very small,
very old and very garrulous Japanese.
He is also very patriotic, though of
course this trait in his character did
not become manifest until the open
ing of hostilities between his country
and Russia. He has a peculiar way
of showing his patriotism. Every
morning shortly after sunrise he ap
pears at his shop door. He makes no
effort to open the place for business,
but calmly takes his seat on the steps
leading into the shop and waits until
the morning papers are delivered.
Just as soon as he spots a carrier he
rushes up to him, buys a paper and
then hastens to a nearby saloon. The
bartender is a great friend of his and
to him he hands the paper.

the romantic play produced at the
Comedy Theater, is what every London

"Mice and Men." with a Ions run here
in front of it and favor In the United
States as well. This is the piece upon
which three young members of Wilson
Parrett's company collaborated under
the name of 'Thomas Racewood."- Its
atmosphere is largely American, two
cut of the four scenes being: laid in a*
Western mining town. Fred Terry and
his wife. Julia Ncilson, produced the
play, and its success or failure meant
a lot to thorn. These two capable stage
folk made an uncommon success in
Paul Keeter'? "Sweet Nell of Old
Drury." but since have come croppers
with two unsuccessful plays, with the
result that they have been rather un
der a cloud. This, by the way. was ex
actly the position of Forbes Robertson
and Gertrude Elliot before they hit on
"Mice and Men."
of the. circumstances may seem best and will arrange for
concerted action by all interests, commercial, agricultural
and governmental, to provide a remedy against future
damage by floods. V
The injury ordinarily done by overflowing rivers in this
State is exceedingly small in comparison with what is suf
fered in many other States, both in point of pecuniary loss
and the extent of territory submerged, and occurs- only
in occasional years when the rainfall is excessive and at
mospheric conditions are peculiarly favorable to floods,
yet it is well to be prepared against all occurrences that
tend to reduce the steady earning power of the soil.
While the inhabitants of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
valleys arc the ones immediately, interested, the question
concerns all residents of the State. Leaving out of the
discussion any general financial depression caused by
floods in a given locality, the partial or entire destruc
tion of those products that are raised only in that locality
brings to a certain extent a hardship upon all, not only
because of a decreased supply, but because of the in
creased price therefor, consequent upon 'the disturbed
condition of the market supply.
The matter is important and it is to be hoped the con
vention will successfully solve the problem, as that part
of the State tributary to our great rivers is rich and fertile
and every safeguard should be taken to make, its annual
output a fixed asset.

The heads of. the various departments
of the Southern Pacific Company are
discussing a rumor to the effect that
a new title Is soon to be bestowed by
President Harriman upon Chief Coun
sel William Herrin.
According to the information that
reached the various offices Chief Coun
sel Herrin will soon be officially des
ignated as the chief executive officer
of the company on this coast, with the
title of either "assistant to the presi
dent" or vice president. These two
titles are now held By Director of Main
tenance and Operations Julius Krutt
schnitt of the Harriman lines, who is
soon to leave for | Chicago. His titles
of assistant to the president and vice
president were conferred on him in or
der that the head of the big railroad
system might be relieved . of much of
the tedious work of signing papers and
documents in this city.
In the departure shortly of Julius
Kruttschnitt for Chicago, President
Harriman has realized the need of an
other representative here and has, in
the minds of the majority of the rail
road officials here, justly selected Chief
Counsel Herrin as the most available
man for the responsibilities of the local
executive position. It Is generally con
ceded that no one here in the employe
of the Southern Pacific Company is
more in the confidence of President
Harriman than Attorney. Herrin, a fact
that has often been remarked when It
has become known that President Har
riman has telegraphed for the lawyer
to meet him on his way to this city
and very frequently the lawyer is in
vited to accompany the president east
ward so that they may, while enjoying
the extreme privacy of their- car, dis
cuss railroad matters in so far as they
apply to the Western interests of the
Harriman syndicate. According to the
best advices received at the railroad
building the order announcing Herrin's
appointment will make its* appearance
in a few days.

Ira J. Jarmon for cruelty. Mrs.. Jar
mon alleges that her husband attempt
ed to drown their infant child in a
sink.
During the trial of the contested di
vorce suit of John J. Rutherford
against Mary M. Rutherford yesterday
in Judge Graham's court Mary M.
Croll was a witness on behalf of the
defendant. She testified that Ruther
ford had brought his seven-year-old
daughter, Amelia, to her delicatessen
store on Folsom street on February 22.
This was emphatically denied by the
defendant and Judge Graham sent for
the little girl, promising that in the
event that her story did not coincide
with that of Mrs. Croll a rigid investi
gation for the purpose of determining
whether perjury had been committed
would be made. The little girl's story
did not coincide with that of Mrs..
Croll, but the Judge took no action.
Divorces were granted yesterday to
Frank E. Davidson from Anna David
son for desertion. Mary A. Paddock
from Herbert Paddock for neglect, and
Ella McKeany from Andrew McKeany
for desertion.
Ernestine Wiehn wants a divorce
from Jacob Wiehn on the ground of
cruelty, alleging that her feelings have
been hurt because her husband per
sists in throwing candles and spoons
at her. She also complains that he
frequently threatens to choke her.
Edwin J. Schaller apparently thinks
more of his typewriter than he does of
his wife, Florence. He once told Mrs.
Schaller that he would rather choke
her to death than discharge the young
lady. Evidence to this effect was fur
nished by Mrs. Schaller and a friend
in Judge Hebbard's court and the
court promptly granted her a decree
of divorce.
Judge Murasky granted decrees of
divorce to Isadore Labell from Chris
tie LabeVl and Lillie Bernzott from
August Bernzott. Mrs. Labell was
cruel to her husband and Bernzott
neglected his wife.
SUSPICIOUS EVIDENCE.
Florence Schneider, wife of William
C. Schneider, a commercial traveler in
the employ of the Lloyd Scovel Iron
Works, tells a pitiful tale of woe in a
complaint for maintenance filed yes
terday. She says shells nearly heart
broken' because when she called her
husband to the deathbed of their little
son at Santa Rosa he would not obey
the summons. She says he received
the message while he was at Pasadena
and paid no attention to it, but con
tinued carousing about the southern
town in the company of dissolute com
panions. She further avers that; she
has suffered because of his neglect and
hardheartedness, not only during the
trying times before . and after her
child's death, but also because, though
he earns $350 a month and has a bank
account of $5000, he does not provide
for her, and that he even compelled
her to defray the burial expenses of
the little one. She asks for a division
of the community property and such
monthly allowance as is necessary to
supply her needs.
QUEER WEAPONS.
â¢ Prince Karl von Ratibor, convoy to
Prince and Princess Hohenlohe-Schil-
HngFfurst, who are visiting the St.
"Jxmis exposition, arrived â¢ here yester
<!Â»y accompanied by his wife, Princes/3
Elizabeth RatJbor, and Victor, Duke
â¢ of Ratibcr. The distinguished party of
German nobles Is making a hurried
trip across the continent with a view
oi petting a glimpse of the country.
Thoy will remain here until to-morrow
:<:id then go to the Ytrsemite Valley
under escort of Thomas Walton, and
from there they will hasten eastward
By way cf Ogden to join the Prince
and Princess Hohenlohe-Schillingsfurst.
who expect to embark on their home
.iva'rd journey on June 9.
The Hohenlohe-Schillingsfurst and
Jlatibor families are among the oldest
in Germany and are closely allied by
marriage, the Princess Hohenlohe-
S<hi:iingsfurst being a sister of Prince
Karl von Ratibor. Prince Hohenlohe-
being a son of the eldest
Njn t'f the late German Chancellor and
the general manager of the Hamburg-
American line cf steamers. He came
i<> this country on April 26 for the pur
.PQse of attending the opening of the
Louis exposition. His party in
cluded a number of distinguished Ger
, rr.ans besides those who arrived here
yesterday- ; .
PARTY DIVIDES.
â¢Immediately after the exposition was
formally opened the party divided, the
Prince and Princess Hohenlohe-Schil
â¢jlngefurst and several of their com
panions going to Cincinnati, while
Prince and Princess Ratibor and the
."Duke of Ratibor came West by way of
Los Angeles. In discussing his trip to
.California yesterday Prince von Rati
b*T-said he had been greatly pleased
vith what he had had a chance to see
during his rapid transit. The democ
racy so noticeable among the people
throughout the United States had im
pressed ail the members of the party.
'/Prince Hohenlohe - Schillingsfurst
had hoped to come this far west." re
, marked Prince von Ratibor, "but un
fortunately he had made other engage
ments and so we came to the shores of
The Pacific without him.
WANT TO SEE YOSEMITE.
"Our greatest desire after reaching
this country was to see the beauties of
the Yosemite Valley of which we have
always heard eo much, and we hasten
ed to the Pacific Coast as fast as we
. tould come. What little we have seen
of California has surprised us a great
deal. It is undoubtedly a very produc
tive section and is being developed in
a very systematic manner. One of the
great reliefs experienced by the visitor
Â¦to your country is the marked absence
cf continental forms of address and the
free and easy rrianners of your people,
whu are unquestionably a race of pleas
ure lovers."
One thing that Prince von Ratibor
does not like, although he would net
admit it for pubiicaiion, is the Ameri
can hotels, the customs of which are
- strange to him and caused no end of
confusion to Prince Hohenlohe-Schil
lingsfurst and himself during their stay
in New York, Washington and St.
Louis. Nothing, however, he remarked,
surpasses the hospitality of the Amer
ican people, and he added that this
â¢ ehould include the hotel managers,
Â¦who. seemingly appreciating his em
barrassment at times, had afforded him
â¢ f : very possible comfort for enjoying
himself. While in St. Louis the Ger
man noblemen and their ladies occu
lted apartments at the same hotel in
â¢which was Prince Pu Lun of China,
to whom they were formally intro
duced and were invited to partake of
the Oriental representative's hospital
ity at the exposition on their return
there.
It took more of the same hard work
on Heney's part to get from the wit
ness admissions as to his attempts to
influence the President and Secretary
Hitchcock in Hyde's interests. The let
ters sent to each, however, were finally
introduced In evidence, and It thus ap
peared that Bailey had given the Sec
retary a batch of testimonials in Hyde's
favor from leading Californians, in
cluding Senator Perkins and Governor
Pardee, and that he had written Roose
velt that the troubles over the land
cases and the prospect of radical leg
islation regarding the forest reserves
were liable to imperil Republican pros
pects in this State during the Presiden
tial campaign. The witness did not
claim that he succeeded in producing a
panic at the White House.
Other witnesses of the day were S. S.
Morton, receiver of the local land of
fice, and two of the office clerks. Miss
Ethel L. Cumbers and Fred D. English.
They were called to prove that Hyde's
clerks were busy last year in guiding
some of his white and colored purchas
ers of school lands to the office, where
they made affidavits designed to repair
the defects in his titles and thus aid in
lifting the suspension order issued
against all the Hyde lieu selections
pending before the Interior Depart
ment.
D. E. Tennyson, a San Jose notary,
was the last important witness of the
day. He told how Hyde had commis
sioned him to get some of his "reliable
friends" to take up school lands. He
spent a good part of last year in this
work and got $4 a head for all the ap
plicants he got to sigrf the blanks Hyde
provided him with. The applicants
themselves got nothing for the surren
der of their school land rights unless,
perchance, one might plead that he
needed a meal. "In such case," said
the witness, "I gave him four bits."
None of the forty or more applicants
who were thus induced to take up
school lands without compensation for
Hyde's benefit had ever seen the lands
described by them under oath as from
personal knowledge.
This morning at 10 o'clock Attorney
Knight hopes to have Mrs. Belle A.
Curtis in court for further examination
connected with points in the anonymous
letters. He says she has been evading
the service of a summons for a week
or more, but said yesterday that he
had finally succeeded In locating her..
TRIED TO SCARE ROOSEVELT.
Gilbert E. Bailey, a mining expert,
who has been employed during the last
year by Defendant Hyde, was next
called by Heney. who Questioned him
at length regarding his mission- to
Washington last year, when Hyde paid
him $150 a month, as he said, to keep
an eye on proposed legislation hostile
to the speculator's Interests. Bailey was
a reluctant witness, and only after
many evasive answers did he finally
admit that Hyde had sent him the $20,
000. This he deposited with the surety
company that furnished a bond of
equal amount for Hyde's codefendant,
Joost H. Schneider, when he was ar
raigned in the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia.
All testified to the care taken to keep
their investigations from public notice
âa precaution that succeeded as to al
most all the details, although many
rumors, largely inaccurate, found their
way into the newspapers. The only
serious leak the Government witnesses
were willing to admit was that which
led to Hyde's office. Because of the
evidence that the speculator was fur
nished by his tools in the land office
with secret information regarding the
investigation and that Hyde communi
cated this to his attorney, Dimond, the
Government claims to have shown con
clusively that the anonymous letters
were the product o* Dimond's pen and
typewriter.
Just one witness was called by
Knight of Dimond's counsel. This was
ex-Senator C. N. Felton, who, sum
moned before as a witness for Dimc-nd,
had given damaging testimony by
denying that he advised the defendant
to "bone" Hyde for further compen
sation and declaring that he could not
definitely recall having seen the anony
mous letter Dimond said he had shown
the venerable statesman. Felton yes
terday modified his farmer testimony
to the extent of saying that, on later
reflection, he believed Dimond had read
a letter or parts of one to him at their
interview, but that he had paid no at
tention to it.
SKCRECY OXLY PARTIAL*
"This hearing must end not later
than Friday, gentlemen, argument or
no argument." So said United States
Commissioner Heacock to the lawyers
In the land frauds case at the close of
yesterday's session. The attorneys'
promises to complete the testimony
had not been kept, owing to the finding
of new witnesses and the failure to
find others. His Honor's peremptory
warning may be taken as an indica
tion of the limit of proceedings before
him, but it is admitted that the attor
neys for the defense, anticipating the
possibility that Heacock may hold
their clients for trial, are preparing
for habeas corpus and other proceed
ings before* Federal Judges de Haven
and Morrow. These may take much
time and defer the removal cf Hyde
and Dimond to Washington indefi
nitely.
Most of the day was occupied by
Government Counsel Heney in calling
out testimony from Federal officers and
employes to show that their investiga
tion o-f the Hyde-Benson transactions
in lieu lands was carefully kept secret
from the public until after the indict
ment was returned. This evidence was
designed to meet the allegations of
Dimond's counsel that the facts set
forth in the anonymous letters were
known to many persons when these
epistles were written and, therefore,
that Dimond had no exclusive knowl
edge that wc/uld connect him with
their authorship. The persons exam
ined were William J. Burns, the secret
service man. and Judge A. B. Pugh,
the attorney of the Interior Depart
ment, who were engaged in gathering
the evidence and preparing the case
for the Grand Jury of the District of
Columbia; Irvin Rittenhouse, Burns'
secretary and stenographer, who took
down the confessions of Harlan and
Valk, the land office clerks who de
clare they were bribed by Benson, and
Oliver E. Pagin. Assistant Attorney
General of the United States, the ex
pert who wrote the long and compli
cated indictment against .which the de
fendants have been battling during
seven weeks.

â¢ Th/Â» first American Waterloo Cup. the
â¢ most sought after trophy offered for
. competition among greyhounds. haÂ«
-just reachf-d its owner here. It was
von at Oklahoma City last November
hy Rubber Ankles, the nomination of
-J. H. Rosseter of thiÂ«= city.
Mr. Rosseter has been a consistent
supporter of the coursing classic since
; its inauguration in 1S95. He has won
' the stake three times in all, but last
â¢ year was the first time a trophy ac
<ompanied the purse. His first repre
sentative was the mighty Emin Pasha
' which was beaten in a fluke. Five years
later this same greyhound divided the
Ftake with May Queen at Sherman,
Texas. Tnder the rules of coursing
when a stake is divided it counts in
tho records as a victory for both grey
hounds.
Mr. Ro?seter was socond for the
"Waterloo in 1901 with Rocker and won
â¢it In 1S02 with Roman Athlete at St.
Lou!*'.
The challenge cup stands nearly
twenty inches in height and cost $350.
It must be won twice to become the
property of any leashman. There is
â¢ great rivalry for this year's meeting.
Chicago. Butte and Oklahoma clubs
all desire to promote it.

CHAMPION TO MEET BERGEE.
Berger-Rodenbach Match
Promises to Be a
Fast One.
LONDON, May 11. â A sensational
liber suit, brought by the well-known
race horse owner R. S. Sievier against
Sir James Duke, also well known on
the turf, was concluded to-day with a
verdict for Sir James. Sievier charged
the latter with calling him a thief,
card-sharper and murderer, and also
that Sievier caused his famous mare
Sceptre to be pulled In the Derby. Sir
James pleaded privilege, as the state
ments we re made within the Raleigh
Club, but he endeavored to show that
Sievers' character was such that he
could not be libelled. The jury de
cided that Sir James had not commit
ted any libel and mulcted Sievier in
the costs of the suit. â¢
Justice Graham, in summing up, was
severe In his strictures on Sievier. He
said the late Queen Victoria would al
most rather have given up her throne
than have such a man presented to
her.
The case attracted continued interest
owing to, the fact that Sievier's past
life was probed with a minutenesa
scarcely ever equalled in a similar case.
HÂ»,* confessed to hnving been three
times bankrupted and to being sev
eral times in police courts, but for
trifling assaults at card games and bil
liard matches. Bets running into thou
sands of pounds were recounted from
the witness stand with a frankness and
in numbers that somewhat amazed the
hearers. In the long run, Sievier de
clared, he was a heavy loser in gam
bling transactions. One game in partic
ular, when the Duke of Braganza lost
about $25,000 while playing with Sievier
at Monte Carlo, caused much cross
examination. r.'S'A:
On another occasion Sievier won $80,
000 from a friend at cards. The loser's
wife wrote him a pathetic letter and
Sievier accepted $12,500, "a pretty large
sum for a card sharp to let anybody
off." remarked Sievier on the stand.
After his return from Australia
Sievier was presented at court to
Queen Victoria, but some months af
terward the court circular announced
that the presentation was canceled.
This Sievier attributed entirely to the
fact that he had been a bookmaker in
Australia.
Through all the phases of his check
ered career,' from the tirre he "smacked
Lord Deerhurst's face" in a Melbourne
racing; club (the same Deerhurat who
married Miss Bonynge cf San Fran
cisco and r.ho was then aid-de-camp
to the Governor) up to the present day,
Sievier'B life was mercilessly dissected.
Sir James Duke's counsel did not put
forward any evidence tending to show
that Sievier was guilty of card-sharp
ing, pulling Sceptre or other horses,
thieving or murdering.
Sievier married Lady Mabel Bruce.
sister cf the fourth Maquis of Ayles
bury. She had arranged to marry an
other man. but two days prior to the
wedding she ran off with Sievier.
Sievier. who was the former owner of
Sceptre, is classed as the most daring
speculator ever seen on the English
turf.
W. K. Vandorbilt in May, 1902. was
reported to have offered Sievier $210,000
for Sceptre, winner of the 2000 guineas
stake and of the 1000 guineas stake, and
a leading candidate for the Derby that
year. Sievier is well known and well
educated, and has been in turn a book
maker, an actor and the manager of a
betting agency. He has been stranded
financially, but is now a wealthy owner
and possessor of the best horses on
the turf, all acquired with the results
of sensational plunging.

A treat Is in store for the lovers of
boxing when Sam Berger, the pride of
the Olympic Club, and William J.
Rodenbach.* the American champion
amateur heavy-weight and middle
weight, clash in Mechanics' Pavilion
some time this month. The date of the
contest has not been decided upon, but
it will probably occur during the last
few days of the month.
Rodenbaeh will settle down to hard
work to-day. He has not as yet select
ed his training, quarters, but he likes
the Beach Tavern and it is expected he
will begin his work there this morning.
He visited Croll's Gardens, Alaraeda,
yesterday with his trainer, Paddy
Powers of New York. He inspected
the place, but went away without de
ciding as to where he will train.
In the meantime Berger is roundin*
into condition at the OlympiQ Club un
der the watchful eyes of the veteran
trainer of boxers, De Witt Van Court.
Berger is in fine trim at the present
time. The men will meet at catch
weights, so neither will have to worry
about taking off flesh. Rodenbach is
said to weigh but 152 pounds now.
Vfhlch gives Berger quite a pull in the
weights.
The men will meet under the auspices
of the Hawthorne Athletic Club, and
the winner will receive a handsome sil
ver cup valued at $250. The contest will
be given under a sanction from the Pa
cific Athletic Association, that body
having made an exception in this in
stance and granted the club a special
sanction to offer a trophy of that value.
Preceding the Berger-Rodenbach fight
there will be several other amateur
contests between well-known boxers.
Jack Hughes of the Haw-thorne Club
and Bob Lundie of the Olympic Club
are to do battle for the lightweight
championship. Bob Cairns and Bert
Marsh of the Olympic club have also
been matched.
Anrelio Herrera Defeats Lonz.
BUTTE. Mont., May 11. â Aurelio
Herrera of Bakersfield was given the
decision to-night over Louie Long of
Oakland after twenty rounds of the
fiercest fighting ever witnessed in this
city. Several times it appeared a knock
out was imminent, but each time th*
Oakland lad came gamely back at the
Mexican, showing remarkable recuper
ative powers. While Long showed the
cleverest footwork he lacked the hit
ting ability of the dark-skinned fight
er, who bored in particularly during
the infighting, raining blows on Long.
The Mexican, while exercising every
caution, went after Long viciously
throughout the fight, sending him to
the floor for the count of nine In the
sixth round. The gong saved Long
from a knockout in this round.

PORTLAND, Ore., May 11. â Over
all, the big college pitoher with the

riods, but .Sullivan outclassed him in
the slugging.. -'
That made the score read 4 to 2 in
favor of Los Angeles. The Angels' half
of the ninth passed without event, but
Oakland created a sensation. Dr, Mos
liiman led off with a stinger to right.
Hey*rad just landed on the bag when
Schafly, who had struck out three times
during the day, landed out one to the
extreme corner of left field for three
bases. Moskiman came tearing over the
rubber, and Sehafly arrived with the
tieing run a moment later when Streib
punched the leather out past Smith.
Oakland qu't right there. They could
not bring In the other run, try as they
would. The game then went Into tlie
extra inning stages and entered upon
an epoch of sensations. More hair
breadth plays were made during the
rext four innings than happen on some
ball fields during an entire season.
In nearly every inning Oakland got
men on the bases, but the masterly
pitching cf Baum kept them far away
from the home plate. In the thirteenth
Schafly hit safely, but Baum struck
Streib out. Schafly was caught trying
to steal second, completing a great
double play.
Los Angeles eased a man over the
plate in *he fourteenth, and it looked
good enough to be a bread-winner.
Smith smashed a ripper out to right
; field and stole second. Boettiger failed
to hold tine next thrown ball, and Smith
pulled xh< at /third. Bernard manipu
lated a timely one past Francks, and j
Los Angeles had apparently won the |
great struggle. j
"It's all over," shouted the wise con
tingent. "The Angels won. but Pete put
up a game fight." Haijdly had the cry
ceased when Devereaux sent a two
bagger disappearing through the fog
In center field. Boettiger sacrificed, and
every one waited to see Oscar Graham
line out a long fly, for that was all that
was needed to tie up the score.
The first ball was pitched and no
damage resulted. A dull thud was heard
as the next one came shooting over thy
plate. The fans watched Cravath as he
gazed hopelessly at the center field
fence. The fans looked that way also,
and as they did they espied the ball as
it dropped Into Mrs. Blibbets'. back
yard. Then a cheer, and a mighty one,
was sent up as Devereaux came In, and
a tiger was given with a vengeance
Yhen Graham, the hero, the man who
broke up the greatest game of the sea
1 son, planted his foot on the home plate.

dividual has performed in years. When
the blonde-topped twirler hoisted the
sphere far above the fence that sur
rounds center field the sun was low.
for it was the fourteenth inning. Los
Angeles had five runs, Oakland four,
and BUI Devereaux reposed on second
base. Score Oakland 6, I^p Angeles 5.
Such an ending to a game full of sen
sations Is seen but few times in N the
lives of baseball fans. From the start
till the glorious finish one sensation
after another happened. In quick suc
cession. There was nothing lacking in
the game- to make it wonderful, and
when the end came those present were
bo much surprised- that most of tham
knew not 'what had happened.
Los Angeles played the full fourteen
innings without making the slightest
semblance of an error. Young, Charley
Baum pitched a game that will win
him glory wherever baseball is talked.
Toward the end he began to' grow
weak, yet he kept up his wonderful
front and fooled batter after baiter as
they approached the plate to take a
swing at the ball.
In fact, Baum pitched absolutely per
fect ball, till the eighth inning hove in
sight. It was then Brick Devereaux
coaxed in a hit to right field. Graham
was passed by the youngster and Gan
ley died easy. It looked as though the
youth would pass the eighth without
allowing a run, but Buck Francks laid
up against a fast one and sent it soar
ing away out to center for two bags.
Both runners came in and broke up the
long cipher string, which un, to this
time had been their lot.

1 MORRIS PARK, May 11.â An unac
countable plunge on Gettysburg in the
last race to-day had an unsatisfactory
sequel to his backers. Just as the
horses began to parade from the pad
1 dock to the starting point, which was
directly in front of the grand stand,
Illyria kicked Gettysburg, cutting the
bone a few inches above the Knee on
the near foreleg. The animal's hoofs
also landed partly on the left foot of
Hildebrand, who . had the mount on
Gettysburg 1 . For a short period it
seemed Hildebrand was so seriously In
jured that he could not ride, and he
was lifted out of the saddle.
F. R. Hitchcock, one of the stewards,
! walked to the, spot and saw that Get-
I lyeburg was bleeding. He was assured
j by Hildebrand that he was not injured
sufficiently to prevent his riding. J. E.
Madden, after a hasty look at the
wound, decided it would not affect his
colt's chances. The racer joined the
others and a chorus of hisses saluted
the decision to start him v He ran fair
ly well, but finished unplaced. The raee
was won by Honolulu, hitherto regard
ed as a mere selling plater. It was the
alertness of Cormack. Honolulu's rider,
to which the horse's victory must be at
tributed. When the barrier was re
leased his rider was so quick to take
advantage of it that he shot his horse
to the front and was never headed.

CHICAGO. May 11.â The sensation
at Worth racetrack to-day was the ac
tion of the Stewarts in indefinitely sus
pending Jockey Henry for his alleged
poor rides on Monastic and Hands
Across. It Is a question in the minds
of. many spectators if any jockey could
have won with either horse.
Neither horse showed the least dis
position to run and to all appearances
Henry did everything possible to get
them to show some speed. Many be
lieve Henry will, be reinstated in the
course of a few days. The other races
were devoid of feature, the fields be
ing of the ordinary kind. Outside of
the fourth race, when Gilfain won by
a head, the finishes were not exciting.
The track was in gbod condition, the
weather perfect and attendance good.

The American bark Carrolton, Cap
tain Gordon, now out 103 days from

reinsurance yesterday at 15 per cent.
She was placed on the board at 10 per

The Austrian ship Alba, which was
reinsured at 10 per cent, arrived yes

upper floors of the structure, which is
tenanted by cabinet and piano makers,
were blazing hotly. Three pipemen
climbed ladders to the third floor and
forced their way into. the center of the
building. Finding the heat top great
they tried to retreat, and then discov
ered the door had been caught by fall
ing wreckage; When ten minutes
passed and the three men did not ap
pear other firemen went to the rescue
and carried them from the building.
They were soon revived.
A few minutes later two pipemen
were on the roof when it gave way.
They saved themselves by clinging to
the wall until ladders could be run up
to them. The loss is $50,000.

discovered that one of the walls of

PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarlon's treatise that is
so electrifying the world to-day. He 1Â« no
imitator. His work Is upon original lines,

Quietly and unostentatiously Mrs.
Mary Jones, known as "Mother Jones,"
the champion'of the striking miners of
Colorado, has come to town for rest
after the strife attendant upon the
labor difficulties that now beset the
Rocky Mountain state. Mrs. Jones ar
rived in this city Sunday from Salt
Lake City. She took up quarters with
friends at 1122 Market street, and has
been in retirement ever since.
This remarkable woman, whose name
is well known to every newspaper
reader throughout the United States
in connection with the strike of the
Western Federation of Miners in Colo
rado, certainly belies the accepted con
ception of her appearance. Three score
years and four have whitened her hair
and left their trace on a face that is
kindly yet withal_atern. She has an
affable manner, and looks anything but
a leader of men.
Mrs. Jones was not' averse to 'being
interviewed. "You can quote me aa
saying," said she, "that I consider af
fairs in Colorado a disgrace to any
civilized nation. I witnessed more
brutaUty there than I conceived that
any human wretch could exercise over
another. I was detained in Price, Utah,
for eighteen days by the authorities
on the pretense that* I had been exposed
to smallpox, but it was only a subter
fuge to keep me from my work."
In speaking of the action of Gov
ernor Peabody in callingÂ»out the militia
Mrs. Jones gave it as her opinion that
the chief executive would live to regret
his hasty action. Mrs: Jones intends to
remain here for ten days and then re
turn to her field of labor. The cogno
men, "Mother Jones," was given to her
many years ago in the cotton mills 'of
the South, where she secured employ
ment in order to study the condition
of the workers in that Industry. The
children always called her "Mother
Jones," and the name has stuck to her
ever since that time. Mrs. Jorjtes is a
former resident of this city, where sha
lived many years.
It was the clam in the chowder that
led to the arrest of "Lucky" Smith in
a wineshop on Sacramento street.
According j to the -statement of the
complaining/ officer, corroborated by
Mr. Smith himpelf, the latter had earn
ed his sobriquet by his phenomenal
luck in drawing the clam almost every
time the chewder urn was placed upon
the free-lunch "counter ? and ' the com
petitive angling ensued. Day after day
he triumphantly .forked and dragged
forth the much coveted j morsel ' from
which -the liquid "decoction- derived: its
title, but riot Its flavor, while a horde
of disappointed rivals for its posses
sion prodded and stabbed the depths
in\ vain. There were fourteen entries
for the clam last Tuesdayâ expert

Pending completion of his mental re
habilitation, William Mulcahey will
remain in the City Priso-n. When his
memory has been perfectly clarified a
charge of vagrancy against him will
be disposed of by Judge Mogan.
Mr. Mulcahey was arrested last Sun
day for drunkenness at the northern
end of Kearny street. He appeared
in court Monday and declared that the
last thing he remembered having done
prior to finding himself a prisoner was
taking a drink at the southern extrem
ity of Third street. The case was con
tinued twenty-four hours to afford him
opportunity to remember. On Tuesday
he reported that he had succeeded in
advancing his recollection as far north
as Third and Mission streets, where
it again 1 balked.
"Well, you got it started going, any
way," said the Judge, encouragingly,
"and perhaps another night of intel
lectual travail will get you across Mar
ket street. Go back and try it."
There was exultation in Mr. Mul
cahey's features and tone when he
faced the bench yesterday mornUig and
announced' that > he had spurred his
memory until it landed him at Kearny
and California streets. ,
"Ah, .that's going some," exclaimed
the court, approvingly. "There is ; a
void of about a dozen blocks yet tO/be
accounted for, however, so you must
resume memory-raking. Go: to it and
come back here to-morrow."
Mr. Mulcahey's brow instantly be
came corrugated as a zinc roof, and
his eyes saw not the immediate en
vironment: as Bailiff Hickey tenderly,
led him away as one leads a blind
man.
Tomaso Tomazo, a recent importation
from the Grecian Isles, refused to move
his peddler's cart from Market and
Beale streets when commanded to do
so by a policeman, and in defense of
his declination he defiantly flourished a
Tiawker's license in the face of Judge
Mogan's court ad declared that the
document qualified him to sell fruit
when, where and in such manner as he
pleased within the city limits.
After he had been pronounced guilty
of violating the ordinance which pro
hibits street obstruction by stationary
fruit stands, the fiery Greek was in
formed that so long as he chooses to
remain in this country he must respect
that section of the constitution which
prescribes equal rights to all and spe
cial privileges to none. He will be
sentenced to-day.
"No, sah; yo' persumpshun am erro
neous. De wud 'buttin,' as preshiated
by me, means erbrupshun. I did not
go in erbruptly, but jes aidged in
cahmly."
"The court stands enlightened, and
in gratitude for your' vÂ«ry lucid ex
planation will allow you to go free.
Signor Boccacio is also restored to lib
erty. If any of the roysterers who
started the rumpus had been arrested
there might be a different ending to
the case."
Daniel Boccacio, of Italian ancestry,
and William Evans, of African descent,
were engaged in amicable converse at
5 o'clock last Sunday morning on Du
pont street, near Vallejo, whÂ«n a crowd
of gay revelers jostled them oft the
sidewalk. Boccacio's torrid Latin tem
perament impelled him to instant re
prisal, while Mr. Evans, of cooler blood,
"jes aidged in." as he described his re
taliative movement to Judge Mogan.
"You mean to say that you butted In,
I presume?" his Honor ventured.
Irene Davis was cruising along the
Barbary Coast at 4 o'clock yesterday
morning when she sighted Private
John Homer, U. S. A., tacking up Pa
cific street with evident intention of
swerving into Kearny. Press'ng on all
available sail, Irene overtook ihe ron
of Mars at the intersection of
thoroughfares named and implored him
to protect her from a man '.vho was
leaning against a nearby telegraph
pole. Ere the soldier could respond to
the appeal for aid the man abandoned
the pole and was advancing toward
Irene, when there was a flash and a
sharp report. The man staggered back
with a bullet wound furrowing his side.
Private Hprner stood dumfounded
and Irene calmly walked into a drug
store, where she was arrested by Pa
trolman Brown, who also sent the
wounded one to th- Receiving Hos
pital.
All the parties were before Judge
Fritz later in the day, but no complaint
had been filed and no prosecution could
be forced, so the woman was dis
charged. The man whom she shot
turned out to be James Halliday of 558
Stevenson street. He resolutely declined
to prosecute. Private Homer knew
nothing of the parties or the cause of
the shooting, nor had he seen the pistol
in the woman's hand. Officer Brown
merely saw her enter the drug store. If
the bullet had struck Mr. Halliday a
little more to the left there would have
been work for the Coroner.
Mrs. Bingham was among the in
mates of a disorderly house on Taylor
street when she was arrested for va
grancy, and then came the disclosure
that for years she has been devoting
her shameful earnings to the mainten
ance of her husband and two daugh
ters, the eldest of whom is fourteen
years of age. When asked why she did
not aesert her wifely rights and force
the man to support the family, she re
plied /hat he was an invalid and un
able to work. This statement has been
proved false, however, several persons
who know the couple testifying that
Bingham is big, strong and worthless.
"Why did you try to defend this
man's cruel treatment of yourself and
your children?" Judge Mogan inquired.
"Well, he started to search for work
just as soon as he heard of my arrest,"
was the answer.
A warrant is out for Bingham's ar
rest, and the charge is vagrancy.
It will not be any fault of Mrs. Jane
Doe Bingham, alias Crossley, a de
scendant of oife of the oldest Spanish
families in California, if her husband
is punished for compelling her to sup
port hint! and their two children by
leading an immoral life, for in Judge
Mogan's court yesterday she showed
unmistakable inclination to shield the
man from pursuing justice. But it is
the hope and ambition of Officer Young
of the Society -for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children to convict Bing
ham without the aid of the woman. /
Judge Cabaniss dismissed Joseph
Egan and Thomas J. "White, striking
stablemen, charged with having dan
gerous weapons in their possession
while doing "picket" duty at a stable
on Polk street. White had an iron
wrench in one of his pockets. Robert
Hayes, who was arrested at the same
time and place,, has been given further
time to plead satisfactory reasons for
his being equipped with brass knuckles.
* â¢ Â«
Assault with a deadly weapon is the
charge against Santo Moscow, who
thrust his stiletto into the neck of
Giuseppe Blandi, where it remained
sticking until a citizen withdrew it. The
case will be heard by Judge Mogan on
next Tuesday.
The stabber, the stabbee and another
Italian are partners in a garbage haul
ing enterprise, and were riding upon a
wagon which is their joint property
when a three-cornered argument over
business matters resulted in the stiletto
play by Santo. The vehicle was at the
intersection of Cole and Frederick
streets, and a number of persons who
witnessed the murderous act will be
called as witnesses. Patrolman Rorke
arrested Moscow and had Blandi sent
to the Receiving Hospital, where he is
still confined.
"No, we are not the original lumber
yard kids," said John Smith and Ber
nard Bolenburg In response to a judi
cial request for information.
The policeman found them asleep,
with a pine plank for a coverlet, in a
lumber yard at Spear and Folsom
streets, and* when he awakened them
and inquired aa to their purpose in be
ing there they answered that they
were in search of comfortable slumber,
as the sultry weather made the hay
bales on the wharves too warm for
human-habitation.
They wooed morpheus last night in a
nice, cool steel tank.

John Coughlln said he was awaiting
a friend with whom he had an appoint
ment when a policeman arrested him
at Jackson and Kearny streets.
"He had been standing upon that
one spot for hours," complained the
officer, "and would neither move on nor
explain why he wanted to stick to that
spot. When I first spotted him he was
acting suspiciously. I had seen him on
that spot many times before."
"Mr. Coughlin, you are accused of
being Johnny on the spot," said Judge
Mogan, "and after I have learned some
more about your character â which I
hope is spotlessâ you will receive (en
lightenment as to your immediate fu
ture."
Bailiff Hickey murmured something
about the leopard changing its spots,
and Clerk Grey opined that it was not
the leopard, but the chameleon, that
undergoes the remarkable" transforma
tion.
lunchers all of themâ and although
Mr. Smith's fork was the last one to
grope for the prize it was the one that
captured it. The defeated contestants
might have gulped their chagrin, as
they often did before, if the winner
had not held aloft the dripping clam
and tauntingly twitted them as to their
incompetency. But he did that very
thing and the thirteen fell upon'him
as one man and maltreated him sorely.
In the scuffle the clam disappeared and
the police suspect that the bartender
got it.
"As you seem to have been more
sinned against than sinning," said
Judge Mogan to Mr. Smith', "and as I
do not desire to shatter your reputa
tion for good luck, you may go hence
to freedom.'.'

WHEATâ There was no foreign news worthy
I of note. â¢
1 Chicago was lower on the day. The private
wires of Mitchell, Mulcahy &. Co. from there
â¢said:*- "The Government report Indicates a
winter wheat crop of 60,000,000 bushels below
last year. This may be modified by present
improving conditions and the increased acre
age of spring wheat. It still leaves us an
exporting country, and the question remains,
Will Europe come up to our prices or must we
go down to theirs? St. Louis reports very fine
advices from the Southwest, and says . that
there/Will be 25 per cent more wheat tributary
to St Louis than last year."
The' only noteworthy change in .this market
was an advance In Northern Club, which is in
especial demand 'Â¦ for mixing . with Â¦ California

for some time. XÂ«ws developments were not
la-king, but the response to them was very
si'.ght. The Government crop report was rt-
Kardrd as decidedly unfavorable in the amount
Of the prob.ible yield indicated of winter
v.h^at. But the showing had been discounted
I aj.par.-r.tly. both In the stock and the grain
marttftj. neither of which was appreciably
afTfctf-d. Another nfws development to which
p.-n*ral importance Is attached, although long
*xpect"d. ia the proposed issue of debenture
bonds by the N<=w York Central. rei>orts of
which were generally credited, although not
officiary confirmed, before the market closÂ»d.
Tl-e iiÂ«5ue of a bond for a moderate term and
at a rate of Interest above that recently paid
by that company was variously interpreted.
With both ttock and bonds authorized and
not issued it Is evidently an admission in effect
of the impossibility of issuing these on favor
able tcnr.s in the present market. On the
other hand, the plat-ing of the debenture
issue with a syndicate Is evidence of some im
provement in the absorption power cf the
bond market. The conspicuous feature of the
<Jay"Â» stock market was the selling of United
States ?:eel stocks, which carried the com
ir.cn stock to O'c a level never b?.'orÂ«Â» touched
The telling nai attributed to feeling on the
I general cotlook Â»n the trade. Reports from
j thÂ» trade were of declining demand for iron
and expanding facilities for output by the
United States Steel Corporation's iron depart
ment with resulting discontent by Independent
pixxlueert and suggestions cf plans for steel
works to provide consumption for their prod
uct. But by far the most notable develop
ment of the day was the enormous gold move
ment. Total engagements for shipments by
t'l-mnrrow's yteamer reached $9,000,000. This
concentrated movement is so little in accord
with the intimations of those having the
P.tnema payment in charge that the transfer
would b? made gradually and In comparatively
small amounts, that there was room to ques'
tion whether the. movement was not In large
psrt rfue to othrr causes than the Panama
payment. While the subtreasury paid out
yesterday $ir,.00O.0O0 on the Panama Canal
payment to Morgan i- Co.. the depository
banks were called on at the same time to pay
over about $li:,00<),or;0 of Government deposits
eo that there was little net Increase In thÂ»

Hay and Fecdstuffs.
Hay continues soft, but prices are main- |
tained. Bran and Middlings continue very !
firm and, the trade look for very stlft markets !
when the green feed dries up, as stocks are
slender and promise to continue so for some
time to come.
The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"Arrivals of hay show a still further in
crease for the week, a total of 2050 tons as j
compared with 2850 tons for the week preced
ing; this shows arrivals of about 500 tons dally,
which is exceed lnfc'ly heavy for this season of
the year. Although matters have been rather
depressed, yet we can ivport n Â° further de- !
i cline in prices, chiefly because of the fact
that the Uovernment has again advertised for
quite a quantity of hay. about 3SOO tons,
which, it is reported, will . be called for in
June; in all probability no new hay will be
accepted on this delivery, so at present there
is a good prospect of present pricea- being
maintained for old hay, no matter how soon
some of the new crop makes its appearance.
The San Francieco Hay Association has just
compiled its account of stocic throughout the
sections contributary to our market, which
shows a total of something over 22,000 tons as
compared with 17,000 tons for last year. This
has come somewhat as a surprise to many, for
it was generally believed that the total would
not show over 15,000 tons; it has been shown,
however, that the invisible supply waa consid
erably heavier than was anticipated, and it
was from this source that the market has been
chiefly supplied during the past month.
Crop prospects continue very promising In
most districts and it is generally conceded
that the yield will be considerably heavier
than that of last year. Shipping trade remains
very dull, but of late many local consumers
have shown a disposition to stock up a bit
with hay. so as not to have to feed new hay
at too early a date."

cellent weather of the past ten days had
wrought material improvement In the con
dition of winter wheat. As a consequence
they were not disposed to buy heavily. On
the other hand offerings were rather light,
tlrm cables and small receipts having a ten
dency to check free selling. Under a lair
demand Â¦ from pit- traders a firmer tone de
veloped. July advancing' to 8UV4'S8CÂ»&e. As
the session advanced there was more dis
position to sell manifested and prices began
to decline. The change in sentiment was due
largely to reports as to the condition of the
crop, A Kansas City dispatch claimed that,
taking Into consideration the present outlook
in that section, the Government report was
altogether too pessimistic. According to a re
port from Montreal thei wheat crop in Mani
toba will be the largest In the history of the
country, an estimated yield of 80,000,000
bushels being given for that province and tho
Northwest Territories. Influenced by these
advices the pit crowd commenced to hammer
the market and caused a quick decline. A
lot of lone wheat came out on the down-turn,
commission houses selling heavily on stop-
Iosb orders Before the decline could be checked
July dropped to 84TiÂ®Â»5c. Shorts were fair
purchasers late In the day on an improved
cash demand. Part of the loss was regained,
but the market closed weak, with July at
80 *i 085 tic.
Considering the weakness In wheat the corn
market exhibited decided strength. The mar
ket closed at about the highest point of the
day. July opened a shade to %tBic higher
at 4S%c to 48'Â»c. wold between 48&c and
4SÂ»i04S T fcc, closing at 4S9ic
The feature of trading in oats was an
urgent demand for the May delivery from a
prominent commission nous*. After opening
MUMc lower at 3S%c, July ranged between
SSVic and 39c. closing at 38%c.
Provisions were easier on selling supposed
to have been for outBide account It was a
va*e of free liquidation of July products. The
market received fair support at times, but
the demand was not sufficient to prevent small
looses in pork and lard. July pork closed 10c
lower at $11 27%. July lard was down 5c
at $6 47'4. July ribs closed a shade higher

An almost unprecedented thing hap
pened in Judge Dunne's court yester
day. Five prisoners waiting trial, one
having two charges of -burglary against
him, withdrew their former pleas of
not guilty and pleaded guilty. William
Connolly, an ex-convict, was "accused
of burglary for breaking into the Wil
merding School on February 14. He will
be sentenced to-morrow. Charles John
son, an ex-convict, faced two charges
of burglary, one for entering the
premises of Cohn Brothers, 1034 Market
street, and 'the other for entering the
room of F. D. Freeman, at 1032 Market
street, on / March 7. He will be sen
tenced on May 17. Joseph Murphy,
alias Frank Carroll, an ex-convict, and
George Garran were charged Jointly
with robbery for holding up Joseph
Joyce, of 319 Minna street, on February
25, and taking $20 from him. They, will
be. sentenced on May 18. James Show
was accused of grand larceny for steal
ing,, a silver watch and j fob from C.
Nielsen, of ; 533 Sacramento street, on
March 25, â¢ and -was allowed to plead
suilty, to petty larceny. He wijl be
sentenced , to-morrow. .
On the night of January 10 the de
fendant .and a companion held up
Eugene Cerf of 1155 Octavia street, at
Post and Franklin streets, while he
was on his way home. They took a
watch and $o'60''from h|m. The follow
ing night the defendant and two com
panions held up Frank O. Heissner of
1716 Bryant street at Fell and Laguna
streets, just after he had left his
mother-in-law's residence, and after
taking $3 from him, struck him on the
head with the butt end of a revolver,
knocking him down.
Fred -Raabe Jr., who pleaded guilty
in Judge Dunne's court r to. two charges
of robbery, 'appeared for sentence yes
terday. The Judge sentenced him to
serve ten years on each charge in Fol
som penitentiary, making twenty years
altogether. When sentence was pro
nounced the defendant, who is scarcely
out of his teens, burst into tears and
was. led from the court room in a nerv
ous condition.
A new and more strict medical cer
tificate for the use of physicians while
examining candidates for admission
was adopted.
The high chief ranger was given
power to grant dispensation to courts
to reopen their charters for such time
as he may fix in order to secure new
members at reduced initiation fee, but
in no case shall the fee be less than
55. .
It was decided that no court shall
offer any premium or pay any bonus
for securing candidates without the
permission of the high chief " ranger,
who may withhold such permission if
in his judgment it is not advisable to
grant it.
"It was decided to appoint a commit
tee of one to codify the laws of the
order. â¢
The executive council was directed
to regulate the office expenses of the

The order of Judge Graham is the
final chapter in a sensational case. The
first trial resulted in a disagreement,
as did the second. . Between the two
trials and during the progress of the
second a hoodoo seemed to hang over
the case. Deaths innumerable occur
red In the families of the attorneys,
both for the prosecution and for the
defense and in the Knowlton family
and the families of Ira Doolittle and
his brother, for whom Knowlton was
working at the time of the alleged em
bezzlement. The jurors selected to try
the case also suffered, for a number of
them were taken ill within a few days
after the second trial of the case com
menced.
Because of the failure of the Dis
trict Attorney's office to appear and
prosecute the charge of embezzlement
against Joseph Knowlton, former cash
ier of the Hotel St. Nicholas, who for
the last two years has rested under,
a charge of appropriating more than
$25,000 belonging to his employers, the
action has been dismissed and Knowl
ton is free. The dismissal was ordered
yesterday by Judge Graham on motion
of the attorneys for Knowlton, who
held that the action should be dis
missed because the prosecution had not
appeared -within sixty days after the
last trial of the case, which resulted
in a disagreement of the jury, and re
newed the prosecution or taken steps
to re-try the case. A dismissal of
prosecution under such conditions is
provided for in section 1382 of the
Penal Code. -and this section was cited
by Knowlton's attorneys when the mo
tion for a dismissal was made.
The order made by Judge Graham
reads as follows: Â¦Â«> ; ,;.
in this case the defendant. JosÂ«ph Knowl
ton. moves for a dismissal of the prosecution
against him under section 1382 of the Penal
Code, on thÂ« ground that more than sixty
days ' have elaosed since the laat trial of the
defendant and the discharge of the jury. The
record discloses that from time to time the
cause was continued at the request of the
people over the objection of the defendant;
that on the second day of May, 19O4. that be
ing the sixtieth day, the defendant and his
counsel being present personally In court, and
the case of the People vs. Knowlton being
called, the defendant answered that he wan
ready for trial and that at said time no one
appeared on behalf of the people and no good
or any j cause being shown that said cause
should not be heard and tried. It therefore,
iollowa that under section 13S2 of the Penal
Code, subdivision 2 thereof, and in re Blgerow.
133 Cal.. 349. that thla motion pust be granted,
and it Is therefore ordered, â¢ adjudged and de
creed that the prosecution against Joseph
Knowlton be and the same la hereby dismissed.

Dr. JohQ I. Stephen was appointed
chief emergency surgeon yesterday, to
succeed Dr. G. F. Bracket t, who recent
ly resigned under fire" for exacting an
outside fee from M. Fleishhacker while
in the discharge of his official duties!
Stephen's appointment was made by
Dr. J. \V. Ward, president of the Board
of Health, and it will be ratified at the
meeting of the board to be held May IS.
Health Officer Ragan introduced Dr.
Stephen as the new chief surgeon to
the health officials. Stephen^ assumed
his duties at once, replacing Dr.C. F.
Millar, who was temporarily in charge
of the emergency hospitals.
Dr. Stephen was acting chief surgeon
during the month of January last,
when Brackett, who was appointed
chief emergency surgeon at the time,
went East on a leave of absence. Dr.
Stephen organized the . new emergency
staff) of surgeons, but when Brackett
returned to assume his duties Stephen
resigned because he could not get along
with ihs superior. '
The appointment of Dr. Stephen was
foreshadowed in these columns at the
time Brackett was under investigation.
Dr. C. F. Millar was a strong candidate
for the position, but Mayor Schmitz
was practically pledged to give the ap
pointment to Stephen. In fact, the
Mayor said that Brackett would have
only held on until June anyhow, even if
he had brought no scandal to the office,
and Stephen would have then displaced
him.
Dr. Stephen graduated from the King
and Queen College of Physicians in Ire
land on July 23, 1S86, and came to this
city on October 5, 1887, where he has
since engaged in the practice of medi
cine and surgery.

The court-martial, appointed to try

timony has not arrived.

The court-martial appointed to try
Lieutenant William D. Aiken convened
at the Presidio yesterday morning at
10 o'clock. The charge against the
young officer is breach of arrest.
The prisoner sat beside his counsel,
Captain Harold B. Fiske of the Twen
ty-eighth Infantry. Captain John â¢ J.
Bradley. Fourteenth Infantry, Judge
Advocate, opened the case with evi
dence for the Government. Among the
witnesses examined were Colonel Wil
liam I* Pitcher, Lieutenant Thomas J.
Rodgers, Captain John J. O'Connell and
Dr. Titus. 'All of their testimony tend
ed to establish the fact that a breach
of arrest had been committed by Lieu
tenant Aiken. From the general tes
timony offered the facts were deduced
that the defendant, after he had been
placed in arrest for three days, had
sent word to his commanding officer
asking for information as to the exact
status of his arrest. It appears that
he was informed that his arrest com
pelled him to remain inside of his quar
ters, except that he was permitted to
go to the mess hall for his meals. These
orders, however, he did not obey, and
he was found outside of the post. This
was reported by two soldiers of his
regiment. At-the conclusion of the tes
timony the court adjourned; to meet
Friday morning at 10 o'clock, when
Lieutenant Aiken will bring forward
testimony in his own behalf. It is un
derstood that he .will claim that his
disobedience of orders was caused by
his mental .condition. That at the
time he was accused of breach of ar
rest he was verging on a state of
mental collapse superinduced by the
use of intoxicants.
All these stories will be told the
guests in the future, but the picture
will be impressed upon their faculties
that the Fairmont Hotel was con
structed by a daughter in memory of
her father.. That,, in a nutshell, is the
final settlement of the Fair estate.
A deed was placed on record yes
terday in which Mrs. Theresa Oel
richs and Mrs. Virginia Vanderbilt
convey to Joseph Harvey the property
at the northwest corner of Sutter and
Devisadero streets running 40x100
feet, the consideration being given as
$10. The deed is signed by Virginia
Vanderbilt, both for herself and as
attorney-in-fact for her sister.
As guests stroll along the corridors
that are to be in that palatial hostelry
of the Pacific Coast, they .will be able
to look upon the reclaimed land
which James G. Fair took from the
bay when he had the advancement of
San Francisco in his mind's-eye.
In one sense there will be a finan
cial consideration as a contiuous mo
tive, but it will be a monument to the
man who made the'millions and inci
dentally to the daughter who hopes to
perpetuate her father'" name.
Documents have been recorded, as
stated in yesterday's Call, which show
that Mrs. Herman Oelrichs had agreed
to transfer to a syndicate of, San Fran
ciscans the property she received from
her father . and the interest divided
with her brother and sister, for. the
sum of $2,600,000.%
The average reader concluded that
Mrs. Oelrichs was about to abandon
San Francisco and. take the millions
derived from her father's property to
a different clime.
Such construction is - wrong. Mrs.
Oelrichs loves San Francisco. In fact,
she loves Â¦ it to the extent of putting
almost the entire amount of the for
tune derived from, her, father and her
demised., brother's interest in the es
tate into the Fairmont Hotel, iwh'ch
is to be a landmark to the memory of
James G. Fair. â¢. â¢ >
Whether Mrs. Oelrichs will receive
dollar for dollar, in her effort to per
petuate the name of her father re
mains for financial accountants to de
cide, but the fact is apparent that ev
ery, visitor to San Francisco, by boat
or train, will see the giant structure
standing out in bold, relief against the
hills to the west and! will inquire.
Tobin & Tobin are attorneys for
Mrs. Oelrichs. Knight & Hegarty
have acted for Mrs. Vanderbilt, who
was Birdie Fair, and in one instance
there has been an understanding be
tween the members of the bar.
The late United States Senator
James G. Fair, who made the Corn
stock, mine famous; Â¦ who invested in
outlying property in San Francisco,
and who died a multi-millionaire, is to
be honored by a : monument.
