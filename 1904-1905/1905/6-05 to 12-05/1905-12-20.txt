CZAR PRESIDES AT COUNCIL.
ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. tt.-The advo
cates, of universal suffrage had the upper
hand; at Tsarskoe-Selo to-day. When
the meeting assembled we Emperor, who
presided, expressed the .wish that x the
Zemstvo Congress should first present it 3
views. \ Thereupon ! Dmitri Shlpoff, In an
exceedingly earnest "speech, pointed out
the terrible gravity of , the political situa
tion. He urged not only the theoretical
advantage of granting a system of uni
versal suffrage, but also Its absolute ne
cessity from a tactical standpoint, as the
only common ground upon which it
would be possible for the country to
unite.
On the conclusion of the speech the
Emperor â¢ asked Sbipoff bluntly whether
he regarded universal suffrage as neces
sary for the best interests of the country
and Shlpcff replied emphatically that he
did.
The greatest - surprise was the speech
Â«f Count Robrinsky, master of the court,
who : heretofore has been â¢an implacable,
opponent of unrestricted suffrage. Tha
Count began by confessing that two
weeks ago he believed such suffrage
should should never be conceded. Now,
however, while be still regarded suffrage
restricted to the enlightened classes as
the safest - for Russia, he was convinced
that all considerations' must give way to
a single Interest, the saving of the fath
erland. ".Universal suffrage, she said, bad
become the watchword of the people, and
in such a crisis the ' Government must
aclze .; the psychological moment. The
speech made a greata t Impression.
"\u25a0DE WITTE TAKES FIRM STAXD.
: It :la now. understood that Count Â» da
Wltte . at the discussion which will be
resumed to-morrow is determined to force
through a universal suffrage scheme. "

Bourse : arrived here to-day to implore
Count de .Witte to do something to ward
off the blow o? a general strike and also
to settle the post and telegraph strike
immediately, as the only means of : pre
venting financial ruin. The ' committee
painted the outlook in black colors. It
told -the] Premier that already there hart
been ; hundreds of small bankruptcies In
the provinces: that ; the ; paper of many
firms was going to protest,- and that large
concerns 4 were hanging by a thread. It

TKOUBLE OVER A CASE
Administration Displeased
at Easy Manner an Which
Land Fencers Were Treated
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.-Senators Mil
lard and Durkett of Nebraska had an In
terview with -.he President to-day prior
tc the Cabinet meeting,, at, which it was
agreed that William P. Warner of Da
kota City should be. nominated for I/nited
States Marshal of Nebraska to succeed
T. I* Matthews.
The Senators ai*o presented to the
President the name of Edward Rose
watÂ«i, (ditor of the Omaha Bee, for ap
pointment as one of the American dele
ga?Â£s to the International Postal Union..
' Ijt wss learned, that Irvjjag F. Baxter,
who was appointed United States District
Attorney for Nebraska last spring, j has
been requested to resign. He conducted
the prosecution >f Comstock and Rich-
Mrds, charged with illegal fencing of pub-
He lands. They were convicted and sen
tenced to six hours' > custody with -the
liiited States Marshal. Secretary Hitch
cc-ck expressed the opinion that the sen-
Unce was Quite inadequate.
A coniDlication of- the situation was
brought about by Ihe action of tho United
States Marshal, T. â L. Matthew*, who
placed the convicted men in the custody
of their attnrnova for the six hours of
their sentonce. The proceeding of ; the
Marshal was disapproved by Attorney
Geneial Moody, who recommended his re
moval In consequence. He has not been
removed, but as stated he will not be.re
appolnted. The~ request for United States
District Attorney Baxter's resignation ! Is
due. It la undoriÂ»tooJ, to the alleged per
functory manner in which he conducted

that the shooting of Miss Lucille Me-

DRIIiL HITS DYNAMITE
One Body Found on a Tool-

From Scene of Accident
NEW YORK, Dec. 19. â Three men
were blown to pieces, \ seven others
were more or less seriously hurt and.
the occupants of fashionable hotels and
residences in ' the 'vicinity -of 'Fifth
avenue and Thirty-fourth street were
startled to-day, by an . explosion \of
dynamite in an excavation for tha new
Altman buildings Fragments of the
bodies of the dead men were scattered
bver ah area of .hundreds of feet and
it was hours before, the exact, number,
of victims of the accident could be de
termined. The explosion was caused by
a workman unintentionally Striking a
.heavy charge of dynamite which had
been placed in a drill-hole In a ledge
of rocks several days ago and which
defied all efforts to explode it at that
time. : iVfl/i \u25a0' '\u25a0 â¢' ' : \u25a0
To-day the workmen started to re
drill the hole wltlL no thought- of r the
deadly charge which it concealed.
There were .eighty men in the excava
tion .at .the' time, but only a few. of
them were near- the, loaded hole when
the steel drill plunged- into sticks of
dynamite. Thero was a terrific roar,
tho air was filled -with '\u25a0'\u25a0"particles, of
stone, fragments of human flesn, pieces
of timber,- dirt and smoke.' Scarcely a
trace was found in' the excavation of
the" three men who had stood almost
directly over the hole. When *the
smoke cleared away seven others who
had been- within range of the concus
sion were. stretched out on the ground,
their faoGs'and 'bodies torn' and seared.
The sound of the explosion brought
guests' hurrying from the Waldorf-
Astoria, directly across the, street from
the scene of the disaster, and from
many similar places in the vicinity.
Portions of the body of an Italian were
found in and about â¢ Thirty-fourth
street,; nearly 25.0 feet from the point
where, the dynamite exploded, and an
other body was found on top of a tool
house, more than 100 feet away. Frag
ments of the third body were found'far
from' the excavation. -j - i â¢-\u25a0 â¢ '
Jacob Metzger, superintendent for

Kane \u25a0 did ' not prove the sensation that
was expected/ although hUr startling tes
timony may be allowed to Â§nter later on.
Â£Those who filled the courtroom had heard
the rumor that Kane had actually seen
Davis write the codicil which some of the
heirs are trying* to prove a forgery. On
direct examination, however, Kane told
the jury that* he. had 'seen Davis writing
what looked^ like the codicil in. question
and what he believed was the same codi
cil. The court, restricted his. answers "* : . to
what he. had observed, and would not al
low him ; to ! state what Davis had said to
him about the writing. The question of
allowing the admission of such testimony
will be fought out by the attorneys to-:
day. It may be that Kane will be re
called. ' ' - ).'\u25a0;..'.' i- :;.. .'- 'â¢..:- f!v ;

the other hardy pioneers. He first, met
Davis when the latter was an as^lsta'nt

Kane testified that he went to room
with Davis on California street about
sÂ«ven years ago at Davis' invitation. One
afternoon, according to his story, Davis
sent for him, an unusual thing in the day
time, and risked him to sit in the room
with him. Kane said that Davis was
writing on his knee with a stub pencil- and
on a piece of paper like the one on which
the . codicil was written. Kane stated
to the Jury that he was not near enough
to see what was- being written on the pa
per, cquld not j tell vwhether figures were
put down, but; did know that; Davis put
much thought-over the. writing.
On showing,. the: witness, the codicil he
said he' thought the papers were the
same. There was milch sharp talk among
the attorneys'Murlng the" day. The case
will be resumed this morning.

SAYS SHERIFF
STUFFED JURY
Sonoiha's District Attorney
Makes a Seriqiis Charge
Against County: Official
ENDS A- MUKDEK TKIAL
Lawyer Declares His Enemies
Were Summoned by Frank
P. Grace of Santa Eosa
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA. Dec. 19.â Sheriff Frank
P. Grace was charged In open court this
morning by the District Attorney's office
with a' deliberate attempt to stuff the
Jury box in an .effort to secure the ac
quittal of a defendant : by unfair means.
The charge has created considerable ex
citement. . : .
The sensation .was sprung when court
opened this morning and the Sheriff made
his return on a special venire of fifteen
men, from which ten men were to be se
lected to complete the jury In the case
of the People against William Meyer,
charged with the murder of August Kuss
ner at Stewarts Point last Easter Bun
day. It was to be the third trial of the
case, two juries having failed to agree.
District Attorney Pond startled the court
and spectators by asking that the case
be dismissed on the ground that the fif
teen men summoned were called by Sher
iff Grace because they were known to be
hia (Pond's) enemies. "Pond said:
'If your Honor olease. This case has been
tried 'twice by this court and each time .there
has teen a disagreement 1 had expected, of
course, -at this trial to get the full panel . of
the Jurors out of the jurymen drawn from the
jury box. but yesterday my challenges were
exhausted and we have secured but five jurors
and there yet remains seven to be chosen. On
account of some of my actions during tne time
I have been In the District Attorney's office I
have made, by the position I have taken In
Certain matters, some- very strong enemies;
and I see by the return of the special I venire
Issued here yesterday that . with . but one _pr
two exceptions these very particular men have
been summoned here by ; the Sheriff's oiflce.
Those, men on account of ' personal enmity to
ward me would not vote for a conviction under
any. circumstances. .. Therefor* .1 fe^l^thAt. It
would be absolutely useless for me to so to
trial In this case with that condition ot affairs
staring me In the face. -: Of course, as I say,
most of these people are my personal enemies
and the Sheriff of this county knows it. and he
has willfully, 1 suppose, subpenaed thosÂ« very
people here on the Jury. Now I feel that then
Is no use putting this county to any further
expense In this matter, and we will ask your
Honor to dismiss this action. In the face of
these facts, and to discharge this defendant.
Assistant District Attorney Thomp
son followed Pond. \u25a0 He added to the
excitement by. saying:
' "If your Honor, please, â¢ ire want
It distinctly understood that we con
sider this one of the moat flagrant at
tempts at Muffing a - Jury vre . have
ever seen In this eonnty, and we want
It distinctly understood that we pat It
directly up to the Sheriff of this county,
and vre feel, while we cannot put our
finger upon the exact wrong \u25a0 In the
matter,' that the Sheriff knows that in
each -and every lnstnnce these parties
would not vote for a conviction where
the District Attorney now In office- Is
prosecuting the case."
The Judge interrupted Thompson to
say. that personally he knew nothing- of
the charge made by the District Attor
ney. As far as he knew, he said the
men summoned are men of good char
acter. "I think, though," \he added,
"it Is somewhat surprising that the
Sheriff subpenaed them t f rom the Im
mediate vicinity. I thought, of course,
he' would go outside of- town."
"I understand - that, your Honor,"
said Pond, but It Is a peculiar inci
dent and circumstance that many of
these men subpenaed .here, are men
that I have proceeded against In the
nickel-in-the-slot machine cases,-.*or
men Interested in the outcome of those
cases. Some of .them. have, openly and
avowedly stated that they would not
under any circumstances, if they were
summoned, vote for a conviction in any
case." .-w â¢
"If you ask the ; court, said the
Judge, "to make an order dismissing
the action and discharging the defend
ant on the grounds you have stated, I
will grant the motion and. make the
order." \u25a0
' "I insist upon that motion, If your
Honor please," said Pond. \u25a0
"Very well. The motion will be
granted and ,the defendant discharged
and the . action dismissed on the | mo T
tion of the District Attorney on < ' the
grounds' stated by him."

Disastrous Fire Followed by
Panic Among Employes
of Chicago Sign Factory
ONE FIREMAN KILLED
Search of Debris Will Be
Necessary to Learn Full
Extent of the Catastrophe
CHICAGO. Dec. 19.â One fireman was
killed and several employes may have lost
their lives in a flre which destroyed the
enamel sign factory of the Charles M.
Schonk Company, 7 to 15 Park street, to
night. Until the ruins of the building
have been searched It will not be positive
ly known whether any of the employes
\u25a0*'ere killed, either in the explosion, which
Btartea the flre. or by the falling of the
Tialls and floors which followed soon aft
erward.
While the flre was at its height one of
the walls suddenly collapsed and a num
ber of firemen were precipitated Into the
debris. With the exception of Lieutenant
Henry Basset: of Truck Company No. 74,
who was crushed to death, all of the fire
men escaped with a severe shaking up.
A number of the employes -were injured
In the panic after the fire broke out.
There were forty girls and thirteen men
and boys employed in the factory, and,
according to the officials of the company,
all but two persons have been accounted
ter. The police and firemen, however,
declare that several of tne employes were
unable to make their escape, and were in
the building at the time the floors and
wails collapsed, and that until the debris
Is cleared away the number of casualties
\u25a0will not be positively known. The em
ployes who are eaid to be missing by the
officials of the company are Margaret
Becker and Henry Saute.
Â»The loss of the building, which was de
stroyed, and the contents, is estimated
at $250,000.

an appointment made by the Mayor.
Mayor Dunne sent in the name of John
C F. Flnerty to succeed John Minwegen
as a member of the Board of Local Im
provements. By a vote of 40 to 29 the
Council refused the nomination to the
committee on special assessments for
consideration and report. The roll call
showed that this committee stood 7 to
Â£ against the confirmation of Colonel
Flnerty.
â¢â¢ The Issue raised by the majority was
that Minwegen was a capable official
and should not be removed for political
-reasons. Two Republicans, voted with
â¢ the minority and six Democrats with
the. majority. Minwegen, whom the
Democratic Mayor wanted to remove,
is a Democrat and Colonel Flnerty is a
Republican. '- -â¢'- â¢< < -' â¢U.t-

Said to Be Wanted in
East for -Wrecking
Several Banks.
Santa Cruz Mountain Burg Is
Startled by Expose Made
by Traveler.
SANTA CRUZ, Dec. JÂ».â A warrant was
Issued to-day for the arrest of Dr. Ar
thur C. Prober. alias Clarence R. Davis,
banker, editor and merchant of the little
Santa Cruz mountain town of Ben ' Lo
mond, on- a charge of swearing falsely
to his name In an affidavit for a mar
riage license.- Prober or Davis is among
the missing. Back of this charge
is the general one that Davis is Dr.
Prober, who wrecked a bank at Dayton,
Oregon, about a year ago and who is
said to have wrecked several banks in
Wisconsin within the past few. years. .
I Prober or Da\is. as he called himself,
came to Ben Lomond about nine months
ago from Redding, where he said he was
employed as manager of the commlsariat
department of the Mountain Copper Com
pany. He opened" a general store' under
the firm name of C- P. Davis & Co., later
establishing the Ben Lomond News,', a
weekly paper and, still later, within the
past month, starting a private bank. En
tire confidence was felt in him , in this
community and the news of his flight
has been a severe shock.
He was married \u25a0 In November to Miss
Olive Hume, society editor of the Fresno
Democrat, who, with her mother,- owns
considerable property in Ben Lomond.
Since that time a traveling man' who
knew the doctor's alleged record in Chi
cago settled in Ben Lomond and 'notified
Sheriff Trafton that the merchant was a
fugitive from Justice. The latter got an
excellent picture of Prober from the
Sheriff of Yamhlll County, Oregon, and
this was' published in one of the local
papers. On Davis' return from atwo
weeks' trip to Chicago he was confronted
by his wife and District Attorney Knight
with the picture and his record. /He gave
evasive answers, and while the law of
ficer was In private conference with Mrs.
Davis he slipped away, got his grip at
the hotel and disappeared through, the
back door.
â¢Officers were at once put on his track,
but he had a good start, and is now be
lieved to have put many miles - between
himself and this city.
BANKER IN OREGON.
Dr. Prober Disappears After Rnn on
His Institution.
PORTLAND, Dcci 19. â Dr. A. C. Prob
er started a bank at Dayton, Yamhill
County, Oregon, three years ago last
.spring. Interested with him in the
business were a number of townspeople
including J. C. Nichols, R. L. Harris,
John Crawford and others. Prober was
a. man of good address and money was
freely deposited in the bank and almost
as quickly lent on first class mortgages
in the county. Rumors of connection
with banks in Michigan and Wisconsin
followed a visit of a lawyer from Hllls
boro. Oregon, who. It is said, attempted
to collect notes signed by Prober in
the East when 'connected* with banks
there. ' A" run was started on the bank
and Prober disappeared. It was found
"the money was well Invested - and no
charge was made against the banker
though the bank went out of business.

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
PROSPECTIVE CLOSING OF TIDAL
CANAL AWAKENS LIVELY PROTEST
ALAMEDANS WANT WATERWAY OPENED TO NAVIGATION
GOVERNMENT ENGINEER WHO IS SAID TO HAVE RECOMMKXDED THAT TUB 'itJAU 'ANAL UK /LOPED AND MEM
BERS OF THi: ALAMEDA BOARD OF TRUSTEES. WHO STAND READY TO MAKF A V'yiO^OVS PROTEST FOR
THEIR CITY AGAINST SUCH A STEP..... ...Â» . ; .. ... . .
ALAMEDA. Dec. 10.-City Trustee W.
M. Bowers' statement that he had ob
tained inside information that Colonel
W. H. HeuÂ«r. In ctiarge of the United
fiLKtes Government work on thÂ« Oakland
hsrt-or, of which the tidal canal is a
part, was dbout to recommend to the
"War Department that the big ditch,
\u25a0which Connfctd Oakland harbor with San
Leaiidro Bay, be closed because it is
supposed to carry mud into the harbor
channels, ha? ptirred the public, civic
Â«nd commercial bodies of this city, Oak
land and Pruitvile. Concerted action to
have the waterway declared opened to
navigation is planned. The closing of the
big artificial ditch, which, trlth the three
fcteel flrawtiridges that span It, cost near
ly one million dollars, would at this time
be regarded by the interested organiza
tions and communities-* as 'disastrous to
the manufacturing institutions that are
locating along the estuary shores and
ethers that plan to build on the tidal
canal and on San Leandro Bay.
It te generally admitted that when the
tifla! canal was designed by the United
Ftatf? engineers, twenty-throe years
eiro, the primary object was to obtain a
current from San Leandro Bay that
VOUia kÂ£ep the dredged channels of Oak
land harbor constantly flushed, thereby
facilitating navigation. It is now argued
that growing manufacturing and com
tnerd&l interests demand that the artl
fitcil ditch be declared navigable and that
the bridges across the canal, which have
tiever been swung since the ditch was
cotngteteo, four year* ago, be put In
operating conflltloh. The tidal canal la
oM feel wide, about a mile long and has
eight feet of water at low tide. It gives
direct acce&s from Oakland harbor to
the wjde reaches cf San Leandro Bay.
Despite the assertion of City Trustee
Bowers that he had reason to believe
that Colonel Heuer favored the closing
t)f the tidal canal. Chief Clerk White,
assistant to the engineer, says that he
has never., heard that Colonel Heuer
Would urge the closing of the Tidal
Canal. White affirms that the big ditch
was never cut through for the purpowHÃ
of navigation and that Is why it has
never been ot>ened to commerce. The
main object that the Government had in
constructing the canal. White says, was
,10 Improve the navigation of Oakland
harbor. 'Wnlte further states that before
the ditch cduld be closed an Investigation
would have to be made and an appropria
tion secured.
1Â». J. Le Conte, engineer assistant to Col
onel Heuer, and In direct charge of Oak
land harbor, denies that the Government
contemplates closing the tidal canal,, but
he questions whether the Government
â¢will open the canal to navigation. He
said: - ;. ; '.rv '\u25a0: \u25a0:
The talk Ihfct the Government contemplates
nosing the tidsJ canal If silly â all humbug.
There Is no inducement to close It and noth
ing of the sort !Â» contemplated. The Use of
the canal for. navigation Is quit* another
matter bewÂ«ver. and there also the Govern
ment, to tar â¢Â« I know, contemplates doing
nothing to change the present situation. There
Is no necessity of the canal's being - mads
tiaartgabte, .cc totw *â¢ the ' entrance to * Ban
LetnCro Bay li clear, and unobstructed. The
drawbridges that span the canal were put
- there wo that dredgers might paes up and
down the canal. Possibly It wat expeetad
that at same time in the future the canal
rolffct be a water, front proposition, with ves
sels steaialnr up - and down, but tbere Is no
' need of. t uch an arrangement so long as
Baa Lea&dro Bay is open, which It Is bow.
l'nÂ«*r these circumstances the I Government It
not likely to make any change in conditions.
The canal wOl \u25a0 not be dosed now ; nor- will n
be opened to vessel*. . . .
The bridges are said to be in poor condi
tion for drawbridge purposes. Naturally they
%-T*. for machinery that la not. used becomes
Ineffective -In- a Measure." If It ever -I* de
clred to use the tidal canal for navigation the
bridges could. easily and at slight expense be
tnÂ«Â«* Â«ffectlvÂ«.-.---- \u25a0 / -.- \u25a0-:â¢ -.->â-,-
Alamedans desire not only to be as-
sured that the canal will not be closed,
but that the Government will listen to
arguments to open, it to navigation.
Among expressions on the subject are
the following:
John H. Hartor, manager of the Alameda
Advancement Associationâ if tho Â«oinmercial

Miles Medical Cay Elkhart, IndHIRAM JOHNSON BOMBARDS
LAWYER COLLINS' DEFENSE
Defendant Flayed
in a Forensic
Fusillade.
With fire-tipped words that whistled
through the silent courtroom like the
strokes of a whip, Hiram Johnson, attor
ney fcr the prosecution in the case of the
People vs. George D. Collins, lashed the
defendant for three hours In one of the
most powerful and stinging speeches ever
made in a San Francisco court.
Johnson began by summing up for the
prosecution yesterday afternoon in De
partment 11 befcre Judge Lennon, and for
three hours, vrltti but one .intermission,
attacked the defendant and the latter's
desperate efforts to escape conviction and
Imprisonment for the crime of perjury.
As denunciation and sarcasm fell from
Johnson's lips, George D. Collins sat at
his table, taking notes In a steady hand
and evincing ro sign of the thoughts
arising In his brain at the flay
ing words. By his side eat Clarice
McCurdy Collins, dainty and pretty,
who listened with her character
istic intentness to the words of Johnson.
As the opposing lawyer launched into his
ft.lts.ck â¢ upon \u25a0 the character of her hus
band her eyes began to brighten and a
tinge of red grew deeper upon her cheeks
while she stirred uneasily from side to
side.
Dramatic and thrilling as was every
moment of Johnson's address to the
twelve In the Jury box, it remained for
the unexpected to develop the most
dramatic Incident of the afternoon. Sud
denly and without warning Johnson half
turned toward Clarice Collins, who was
leaning forward with parted lips listen-
Ing to his words, and said in ringing
tone*. "A* for the women conspirators
who have stood with this defendant In
biÂ» wrongdoing, we can only cay, 'May
Christ In heaven forgive them, for they
know not what they do.' " .
CLARICE COLLINS WEEPS.
It was the first mention made of the
McCurdys durln* the trial, and as the
Import of Johnson's words became clear
the dainty second wife raised two
email gloved bands to her face
and fell forward r sobbing upon the attor
r.cys' table. Collins sprang: to his feet
and placed his arms around her as If to
shield h*r from personal attack while he
attempted In vain to control the weeping
woman.

ATTORNEY JOHNSON ADDRESS
ING JURY; DEFENDANT COlr-
LINS COMFORTING HIS WIFE.
disorder. Through ttie noise could be
heard the convulsive sobbing of Mrs. Col
lins and the whispered reassurances of
her accused husband. Johnson continued
with his story, but the eyes, ears and
minds of the jury were intent ' upon the
picture of the weeping woman and her
companion. It was then that Judge
I^ennon showed his masterful grip, of
the situation and relieved the tenseness
of the moment by ordering a short re
cess.
Neither Charlotta Collins nor her sister
Florence Newman were present in the
courtroom to witness the humbling of
the woman they have regarded as . their
rival. After the recess allowed by Judge
Lennon, they took their places at- the
back of the room while Johnson resumed
his argument. He closed his appeal for
the punishment of the defendant at 5
o'clock, looking worn out, and with a
voice reduced almost to a whisper.
JOHNSON'S ELOQUENT SPEECH.
The argument of Attorney Johnson was
In part as follows:
"I rememfler in my desultory reading
that more than a century ago, when that
great country France was giving birth to
a new period, and new men were spring
ing up by night and by. day, that one of
the greatest of them would, In the day,
at various places, move his bearer* ac
cording to his fancy. Then at night, In
: his own home, surrounded oy his cronies
with a bottle of wine : before, he , would
laugh at how he had befooled theae peo
ple in the day. And yet during all of that
time he was but playing upon their. fears
and their emotions, himself a very actor,
insincere In all . that he didâthe great
Mlrabeau. I relate - this as : one of : his
traits, and as I sat here the : other - day,
two feet from this defendant, listening to
him for three long hours In an argument
to this Jury that he designated an open -
Ing statement, and heard him talk of this,
that and the other thing, that bad been
demonstrated again and again in this
case to be untrue, I wondered if when he
left this courtroomâ seated on one side
was Fides Achates McPike and on the
other 'Gnm-Vioaged' Boardmanâ l won
dered if then this defendant laughed and
laughed and laughed again as he said to
themâ as he related the incidents of the
day: 'Did you see this Juror pay. dose at
tention when I talked about the mythical
Mulcahuy, and did you see that Juror
listen lnlentlv when I talked about the
deceased doctor and the deceased doctor's
daughter? Did you see all these men lean
forward when I told them about the con
tract, that nobody erer saw, read or knew
about until the trial of the People
against Collins?'.". ...
"MYTHICAL" MITLCAHEY.
Johnson then denied, -'the existence*. of
the marriage contract,' asserted its imma
teriality in ! the present : trial and spoke -of
tho brushing aside of oaths by the defend
ant and itho laying of blame by^him f on
the deceased and. "Mythical"- Mulcahey.
Miiilp speakine of the Newman: family
Johnson moved . many of the "\u25a0 spectators
and several of \u25a0. the Jurymen . to tears. "'\u25a0 He
speke in ringing tones of the attempt by
Collins to bring * disgrace upon Charlotta
and " to ' UleKitlmatize \u25a0 his â¢ 6wn \ children." /
Continulng.-he said:; ;':..; ' '..
"This Is a strange caseâ a strange piece
of ; human play.' You will . never,, regret
as long as you live, that ; you \ sat X upon
this particular case and this - ; particular
man. There \is (pointing to \u25a0 Collins) i the'
most â¢'\u25a0 remarkable : psychological study,
that â¢ this "century r has 1 thua far seen;. May.
It please- God .thatlnb" Jury, need look into
such another \ psychological ; study . during
THE SAN FRANGISGO CALt WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER -20, 1905.
:he remainder of this century! I \u25a0 sat
;hcre watching' him during: the time he
svas on the stand - for \u25a0 hours ' and hours,
nd days, I think, and not a note during
that period did I take, ' so ' intent .was . I
In endeavoring , to , fathom the mental
process of that, human being and bo in
tent was I in endeavoring, to j ascertain
when it was that the 'devil blew upon
hat snul and set it aside to cool, I was
anxious to see if I could solve this human
riddle and I , tell you, gentlemen, it '\ is
the most unsolvable human riddle that
was ever presented to a Jury, or ever will
be again. This Is a study worthy ; of
mankind, because It is the form of man
kind before you. It Is , a study worthy
of any man, a study worthy of any Jury
and this man is a study because he is
only half human as it were. As you
listen to those .' metallic tones coming
from that man, as you see that j every
one of ' those human attributes we hold
dear are gone in him, as you see how
reckless in his statements he is, how
utterly reckless of truth and honor, of
decency, of manhood, how^gone he Is in
every one qf those things that we love
in human beings, his denial of his- wife,
of home, his denial of children, his denial
of God in thÂ© taking of a false oathâ
as you look at those. things in that man
and wonder at his . peculiarities, you can
cay to yourselves, 'Never has such ' a
one as that presented himself to us be
fore.' ' . ,
COLLINS' RECKLESSNESS. '.
"Nev^r such a one as that will present
himself to any. jury again. -He. is a re
markable study, simply a moral pervert
half of his mindâ the other half constant
ly active, intensely intellectual, though I
may say illogical, 7 utterly reckless of
what he does "or â¢ says, caring not for
whom he tramples. down" to the earth.
"And, gentlemen of the Jury, don't per
mit the defendant to declare "that six
records ': and eight living witnesses . lie.
Furthermore, don't believe that he ever
was married to Agnes Newman.' Look
upon that v incident as one of - the ' best
acts In ' his '. distorted \u25a0 life when he per
mitted that poor.- -girl's ..disgrace, for
which he was : responsible,* to ! be con
cealed : from the . world under the cloak
of his name. 'I put the coffin plate upon
the coffin,' declares .the defendant, ; with
as much feeling as if he . had : said -'I
kicked an old , dead cat.'
- '."I '. don* t often . proseoute anybody, but
I am proud to prosecute a case like this.
It Is the only character of : case \ where I
desire to prosecute, where a lawyer 1b at
stake, where his ability is pitted "against
the law of the land he has sworn to up

when a man of culture ". and refinement,

committed, , then \I *. say . I " am ; proud ! ' to

â¢ Miss Lillian Chase, a nurse at the

Fourteenth ; *nd Mission â¢ streets, had , a
thrilling' experience with a footpad on
Monday -night .shortly: after 8 ..o'clock
on Oak street, between r, Clayton \ and

car on the corner * and had walked a
short distance 5 toward Clayton V street
when a man stepped out of a doorway,'
and, pointing a"! revolver' at . her > face,
bald: "Now,- don't, scream!" >
Miss Chase in her excitement shoved
the robber, away and screamed J loudly
for : help. , Her actions nonplused - the
footpad, and,"- after hesitating for an in
stant he ran rapidly across Oak street
and disappeared in the panhandle of
the park. Ronald B. Martin of 1047
Oak street heard Miss Chase's screams
and hurried to her assistance, but by
that time. the footpad had gone. .- .
Martin accompanied: Miss Chase to
the home of her friend, Mrs. Koppe, 407
Clayton street, then notified the Golden
Gate Park police station.: Policeman
Kerrison \u25a0-'\u25a0; saw'- Miss 7 Chase at .Mrs.
Koppe's house; and she described the
footpad as about 6 feet 5 inches . tall,
smooth-faced and wearing a soft slouch
hat. That was all the description she
could give of him, as she was too un
nerved to take much notice â¢ of her
assailant.

WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 20, 1905
THE WALSH BANKS.
'"T>HE Chicago National Bank, by conservative business methods,
I had built up a great business and established a reputation that
V promised a permanent prosperity. All this was done under, the
guiding hand of its John R. Walsh. He was regarded
as; a banking authority, and his credit and fame extended far
beyond the city in which both had been acquired. When Mr. .Gage
abandoned banking in Chicago to become Secretary of the Treasury,
Mr. Walsh was left easily the leader in finance in that city. He was
a public-spirited man, too, and rlo useful enterprise halted for lack
of his encouragement and support.
Under such circumstances it was natural that his bank, and its
collateral savings and trust corporations, commanded unlimited con
fidence and enormous patronage. The deposits in the three con
cerns were nearly $30,000,000, and confidence in their soundness
was unimpaired up to the moment that the extra editions of the
newspapers announced that they were closed by order- of the Comp
troller of the Currency and the State authorities. As the savings
and trust corporations, although impinged upon a national bank,
were under State franchise, this concurrence became necessary.
In the history of banking and of business there is no story equal
to the brief history of the dismounting of John R. Walsh, the
decision to liquidate his three banks, and the assumption of all the
assets and liquidation at par by the clearing-house banks of Chicago.
The three institutions closed on Saturday's business with no breath
of suspicion of their solvency. Between Saturday night and the
opening of business Monday morning the Federal and State au
thorities had co-operated in the legalsteps necessary .to liquidation,
the clearing-house banks had taken over the assets and liabilities,
arid on Monday morning all three of the institutions opened with
announcement of liquidation, and invitation to all creditors to ap
pear and get their money in full.
Nothing like it ever occurred before, either in the magnitude
of the transaction or in the celerity with which it was accom
plished. Too much credit cannot be given to the Chicago clearing
house banks, which saved a very dangerous situation from lapsing
into a panic. John R. Walsh retired Saturday night a bariker
with three creditable financial institutions under his control. He
rose Monday morning not a banker, and without' a bank or a dollar
in a bank in his control, yet his banks opened and paid ' everybody
a hundred cents on the dollar. The incident, instead of weakening
public confidence in banks, has increased it.
The cause of Mr. Walsh's downfall is plain now. He went
into business on the outside. The stone quarry at Bedford, Indiana,
below the city of Lafayette, is One of the most celebrated quarries in
the Middle West. The stone is art oolite, of beautiful color, easily
workable, that hardens when placed in a wall. It is the only ex
tensive deposit of its kind in that region, and is a. favorite huUding
material. Mr. Walsh bought the quarry. Then he needed a rail
road to send the stone to market, and he built it,' fn the' expectation
that he could get a terminal Chicago. Had he succeeded in this
the profits would have been immense, but he failed. The burden of
cost broke the back of his purse and he unloaded by borrowing
money of his own banks. That is all. He was not content to be a
banker and became a speculator. His project was sound business
up to the vital point of a Chicago terminal. > He took that as a* mat

the wrong end of his project. The terminal should have been the

The story should be widely commented upon, for it has a lesson
that cannot be too deeply impressed upon American bankers. The
direct investment by its officers of the funds of a bank in a business
project, speculative or otherwise, is a dangerous proceeding, and
when the bankers own the business so invested in it is immoral,
unless adequate security, personal or in sound collateral, not based
upon the project itself, is put up to guarantee the bank against loss.
Sound banking requires that only securities .that are immediately,
or within a reasonable time, convertible into cash at par, shall be
taken for loans. Stone quarries and railroads, coal mines and oil
wells are not such security. . .
The banking interests of the country are under obligations to
Comptroller of the Currency Ridgely, for his wise management and
speedy negotiation of this liquidation. ;,i; : \u25a0 .
MORTON TO THE POLICY HOLDERS.
PRESIDENT MORTON of the Equitable is a business man
whose common sense and tact go farther than all the craft of
the higlj financiers. . He has had the solvency, of the Equitable
demonstrated by an expert and impartial examination. Then, antici-.
pating that public sentiment adverse to the conditions revealed
in the great life insurance companies will be misused to procure
"cinch" legisJation, he notifies -the policy holders that such legisla
tion will be against their interests arid that they will be expected
to resist and defeat it. He tells' them that the company, as reorgan
ized under his management, will make no more political contribu
tions nor maintain lobbies either to corrupt Legislatures or to re
sist "cinch" bills, but that they, the policy holders, , of -whom there
are thousands in every State in the Union, will be qxpected'to see
to it that improper legislation is resisted and defeated.
No more enlightened suggestion has ever been made. It brings
home to each policy holder his interest in the affairs of the com
pany. If a Legislature proposes an^unjust tax upon the company
it is a tax upon the insured, that is taken out of his dividend and
impairs the value of his policy. It concerns him, and if he! is indif
ferent and the company suffers he shares in the lossjn proportion
to the amount of his policy. This view has never been enforced be
fore. Holders of life policies have been indifferent to cinch bills
and have not felt that their interests .are, involved. Mr. Morton
proposes that the funds of his company shall be treated honestly, as
held in trust for the policy holders, and that the policy holders shall
appreciate their stake in- willful adverse legislation.- Out of his wise
counsel it is probable that holders of life policies everywhere will
effect an organization to act for them in matters of common interest,
not only to watch the life companies arid prevent such . shameless
plundering as that so long carried on by the McCurdy family; but
to oppose and defeat blackmail legislation.

was k\ little 'â¢ boy .; who was \ naughty '\u25a0 and
mischievous 'and* full ; of â¢ cussedness'.' and
original "sih.; So, as Christmas 'drew, near
the little boy's : fond ; parents ; said ; to him:
'-'J Santa'; Claus j. will' nott bring you a'sin

naughty, little boy!" '" " ; ':"
'-T^ien;,thft little boy; thought about^what

gle thing. "Jffi>gj|ffifl|jfC . "' ; ;- : \h}V
Then ; the; little ' boy; carefully considered
the matter/ and . he said , to himself: "Well,

bat, roller skates, a coaster, a" tool chest,
two storybooks, a bugle'and several oth
er'things that I have forgotten.' '
And when the little Jroy had taken them
all out of his stocking; 7 did he prettily
express his gratitude to Santa. Claus?
Not an express! He t merely- said:
"Well, the old codger's fooled again, and
I believe that my papa and mamma are
the two. derndest liars In the State of
California.": .
Moralâ The little boy may be naughty,
but he is pretty middling wise to things
that take place about him.

devoted his time to sweeping out instead

to : discharge the foblest one or to keep
him for the sake of his relatives who

Sorrow Inspires Song
Dorothy Fenimore
A SHORT time ago Dr. Robert Coll
yer introduced Into an address of
his' a. beautiful figure which I how
will give the' pleasure that It has
given me. There Is a certain bird, he
said. that, if it were confined in a cage,
could pick up snatches of song, but
could not be taught one song completely.
But if a shawl were placed over the
cage, and the trainer sat near, the bird
might be taught to sing the song that
its master wished it to sing.
So it may be with us, the grand old
man of the brave heart and the help
ful life went on to say; through trouble,
we may be taught the notes that the
Master wishes us to sing.
Isn't this a pleasant thought to carry
with us. especially, when sorrow's pall
has shuf us darkly in? We are as
songbirds in a cage,' and. were we un
aided or distracted by the glittering
delights of the. full sunlight, we could
not learn to sing a song all through.
Now and again our throats may swell
with the melody of a single unrelated
strain; but never could our hearts re
joice, alas, in the rich rapture of a
perfect Bong.
But if our cage i 3 darkened for a
little while, and our Master, near at
hand, leads on our voices by the music
of his \u25a0 own. we are capable "of being
taught thus the notes he wishes us to
sing.

Counties of Del Norte, Trin
ity and Siskiyou Offer Fine
Chances for Investment
Stories of the discovery of ledges rich
In cold and silver come from Siskiyou
County. An incident somewhat confus-
Ijis to mining men who have largo In
terest* in that region is an effort to
v.ithhold from tbe public true accounts
cf recent development-
Last week 19W pounds of exceedingly
rich ore came to the Selby "Works In San
Francisco from the Highland mine, near
Aetna. It is gossip among the experts
that this quantity of ore, slightly less
than a ton, will yield $35,003 in gold. The
vrork of eliminating the gold and eilwr
vrill be finished come time this 'week. Mr.
Tethrow, owner of half of the mine, was
at the Grand Hotel a few days ago, but
was not at liberty to speak freely of the
discovery, on account cf the Inclination
of his partnersâ Taylor, Butler and
O'Keil of Yrekaâ to enjoin secrecy.
Not long since 500 pounds of quartz
from an adjoining mine was sold to
Shreve & Co. for $1 a pound. The raw
material was capable of being wrought
into attractive design for belt buckles
and ornaments.
The newly uncovered ledges of mar
volous wealth are distant eight or ten
miles from John Daggetfs celebrated
Black Bear mine. The country is not new
to prospectors and promoters of mining
ventures, but there is an impression that
exploration of the field will be renewed
this year with considerable energy. It
5s said that prospecting parties have
been organized and that the Yrekx Board
of Trade is taking measures to make the
world Â«of investment familiar with the
opportunities that Siskiyou, Trinity and
Del Norte counties offer to men of capi
tal and enterprise.
The owners of the Highland mine are
awaiting with a deal of expectancy the
result of the Selby experiments with the
selected sacks of ore. If the amount
realized falls. short of $30,000, there will
be some disappointment.

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
In the public lounging room occupying
the basement of an admittance free home
of vaudeville on O'Farrell . street the
voice . of James Wood, a herculean
framed spinner . of ropes, aacended in
raucous interpretation of "My Irish
Molly, O," and provoked remonstrance
from the special pollcemauÂ«there on duty.
"Cheese on that slngin'," said the offi
cer. "We don't want no singln' by vis
itors, because It interferes with th' sing-
In' by th' reg'lar salaried artists up
stairs."
"Then why don't yer reg'lar salaried
artists sine 'Mollyr " Mr. "Wood, some
what nettled by the interruption, asked
In defiant tone.- "If they'd singr 'Molly'
these folks down here wouldn J t Â«want me
to sine it." *
The applausive murmur that followed
Mr. Wood's - retort did not serve to
sweeten tke peace guardian's temper.
"What th* artists sing is their busi
ness an' ain't none o* yours," he said,
"an' If ye don't stop yer yawpin' I'll take
It for gTanted that ye want t' go out
qulcker'n ye camwln."
No sooner had he disappeared than the
crowd in the. cellar showered expressions
of approval upon Mr. Wood and also
urged him. to warble the refrain .fit
"Molly," which they unanimously pro
nounced the most batchy thing ever com
posed.
"Yon go ahead, kid," said one of Molly's
enthusiastic admirers, i "an* we'll see to
It that th' Jealousy o' them bums on th'
etage upstairs won't, stop ye again. As
a singer ye can skin any o* them a
block." \
"Oh, Molly, me Irish Molly, sweet
heart, I love ye so!" bellowed Mr. Wood,
and . that was as far as he had got into
tho popular song when the hand of the
policeman fell heavily upon his shoulder.
For two or three minutes thereafter the
basement was transformed into an arena
of physical conflict, the only partici
pants, however, being Mr. Wood and the
man in uniform, as not one of those who
had so warmly promised to support the
roperaaker lived up to their word. When
the struggle ceased Mr. Wood was a
prisoner with two blackened eyes.
"I think." he said to Police Judge Con
lan, "that a couple o* nights in th' cooler
and a bunged-up face is punishment
enough for what I done; don't you?"
"I do," replied his Honor, "and if y.ou
sang 'Molly' as the song's excellence en
titles it to be sung I think. you have been
punished too much. You are dismissed."
Martin Xeilson, machinist, residing at
ICIB Golden Gate avenue, discharged his
revolver twice in rapid succession Mon
day evening on Mission street, near Fre
mont, and when arraigned before Judge
Mogan he pleaded drunkenness and said
he had fired in the air.
"What's that you said?" inaulred an
attorney.
"I said I fired at random," replied the
defendant.
"You'd better see if Mr. Random's in
court," whispered Clerk "Pat" Grey to
Bailiff Hickey, who said nothing In retort.
Mr. Xeilson was prondunced guilty of
having unlawfully discharged firearms
within the city boundaries.

Fred I* Winn's horse ran away with
a wagon and Joseph Moller, a boy, pur
sued, leaped into the. vehicle and stopped
the animal, for which he was roundly
trounced by Mr. Wlnn, who imagined
that he had provoked the runaway. Judge
Cabaniss imposed a fine of $20 on Mr.
Wlnn, who is a blacksmith.
Slumber's chains apparently, manacled
the senses of Thomas Stack, marine fire
man,, as he stood leaning against the
cuter wall of a Second-street mercantile
c-stablishment ,laet Monday afternoon.
His eyes were closed, he breathed ster
torously, his arms hune limp, and : his
legs and body seemed to be supporting
him in perpendicular attitude of their
own volition. It was the crowd surround
ing the man that attracted tha attention
of Patrolman F. Potter, and as. he.shoul
dered a lane through the throng he -was
informed* by many persons that, in their
opinion, the object of common Interest
was only shamming sleep.
"We'll soon see . about that," aald >. the
officer, grasping an arm of Mr. Stack and
roughly shaking: it. "Straighten r up,'.'- he
commanded, "and stop f akin'." '->;r
Mr. Stack opened -h ls optics Blowly, :
yawned widely, gazed- around him drows
ily, and \u25a0 then, as the.: situation appeared
to dawn upon his befuddled . mind,; de
manded to know by what double-blanked
and triple-dashed right i his custodian ~ had
awakened . him. And ere .} answ?r ' could
be returned, he struck ? out wildly .with
both \u25a0 fists \u25a0 and : one ; of them . collided â¢ with
the policeman's countenance. Drunken

against him.

could not-lean against a wall : and shut
his eyes without being bullied and brow
beaten by an ultra-omclous policeman. If
there was any ordinance : which specifi

not a word, to say.; ' But aa no such law

"Guilty, of both*' chargesâ sentence > to

"'Deed an' I won't .tell- you my true
name," quoth a* grandmotherly j appearing
shoplifter, as she beamed through i her
steel-rimmed spectacles at Judge Fritz. :
"An' I'm too cute," she chuckled, "to
let you find out who I really am."
"Then your cuteness will cost : you
twenty days in Jail," said his Honor,
"for that is the "alternative of the $20 fine
I now impose on you.^ I know you
haven't got the money, and I know that
if you try to get if from any of your
friends we'll be likely to find out who
you are. So you see that we, too, are
quite cute." ; -'- \u25a0 " \ '
"I bet the fine '11 be paid an' you'll
never discover my identity," she declared
as a bailiff escorted her doorwar^. : ;
She was booked as Louisa Brown, and
when arrested in the Emporium by Spe
cial Policeman J. J. Allen she had pil
fered and was endeavoring to dgpart with
two books, one lace collar, one necktie,
one handkerchief- and three Christmas
cards, the total value of her
being $1 75. A more respectable-looking,
elderly female never was pictured as pre
siding at the head of a Dorcas . society'
or a young ladies' boarding school. Her
fine old face fairly radiated honesty, and
her garb was decent and appropriate to
her age, which was close to_ the three
score mark. She seemed not at all abashed
as she. sat on the bench reserved for
women -prisoners and- was stared at by
many eyes.
"Let 'em stare at me as long as they
want to," she retorted to the court offi
cer, who considerately suggested that she
turn her back to the gaping throng.
VNone of 'em knows who I am," she ex
plained, "an 1 none of 'em will ever see
me again. Let ,'em enjoy, themselves." ,
From which remark j the rebuffed sa
maritan \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 inferred Hha'tM she was - a non
resident of San Francisco.
James Johnson, also advanced in years
and likewise accused of shoplifting,*
neither attempted to conceal his identity
nor to dissemble his guilt.
"They caught â¢' me \u25a0with the goods." he
told Judge Conlan, "an' 1 1 guess that's
about all there's to it."
â¢He was sentenced Jo thirty days. In
his possession when a detective over
hauled him In Olson's Market were -found
three boxes of sardines, one bottle'of ap
ple butter, one can of chocolate and a
bottle of maple syrupâ value, $1 50.
"Naw," he said, 'I didn't steal th'
things t' eat 'em. I'd a-sold 'em if I
hadn't a-bin caught."
Poultney Larastey,. fruiterer at 1415

that he had sold lottery tickets as well

ASSETS ?fTEANSFEREEi)
Amalgamation Accomplished
Only After
Debate in Noisy Meeting
The Mercantile Library, founded in
1873 by subscription In- a burst of 'civic
pride, went':out \ ot* existence last [ nlghi
as | arÂ» inflependent organization. ,' Th e;
members 6f the Mechanics' Institute,* in'
meeting, adopted the report, of thelrTcom-'
mittee recommending â¢ the ; amalgamation
0Â£ the old- institution and their library.
The fused 1 library, vwill ! be known - as ' the
Mechanics-Mercantile The Me-;
chanlcs* Institute tkeeps i Its name and 'br- .;
ganization, 'and the members of , the Merr ;
cantile come into it a!s .lif e | members. Ah |
the. assets of the" Mercantile, including s
SO.OOO volumes, pass over to the Institute. >
This intermarriage of Quiet,] dusty j
tomes did not take tne pacific character
that . might ha-Â»e been j expected. | The
meeting of ' the members' of.:: the Me
chanics' Institute, in fact, was one "to
be termed tempestuous.' There' was a vig
orous minority- against the report of the j
committee " and the amalgamation/ \lt I
was a minority,' evidently,: because when \u25a0
the crash of hurtling speeches had ceased;
from mere throaty weariness and; rioses;
were counted," it was found to consist !off
only forty-one voters against 123. of the;
affirmative fellows. But it was only^inj
the counting that the fact was discov
ered. Before that the | minority seemed
the majority. Theirs was the pulmonary
superiority. They made full* use of it. . J.
Rotschild, Curtis Hilllard.E.R.,War
ner. A. L. Fuller and Tlrey L. Ford spoke;
in favor of the amalgamation. J.,C.
Saulman and P. J. Healey led the oppo
sition. : ', V.'"
Saulman was hard on the report of the
committee. He thought that the assets
of the Mercantile should have:? been
itemized in the 'report.. -He/was, not gentle
in his characterization of the -work" of
the committee. "It's no report; at; all,'/ :
he shouted. "It is a reflection- upon. the
intelligence of the members.",; But his
plea was put in the shade by. that" of ; P.
J. Healy. Healy was ipassibnately. \u25a0 op- ;
posed to the proposed amalsamation and
his eloquence was mordant and his-' tongue ;
a". visitation. "What do we gain by the _
amalgamation?" he asked himself and his;
audience. ' "Nothing but 80,000 worthless
volumes and 600 aristocrats who need pay
no dues the. rest of their lives," he an
swered. By the "600 aristocrats" he al-,
luded to the members of the Mercantile,
who by the fusion, become life members
of the institute. Throughout* his speech
he showed no love for these future broth
ers. "An exclusive set, supporting a li
brary for dilettantes," ; he. called , them.
"Threatened v with bankruptcy," he',thun
dered, 1 "they now offer to come to us
with their habit of failing." Healy's
speech was long and the meeting grew
restive under it. Choruses; of coughing,
stampings of feet and friendly invita
tions to "sit- flown" made his oratorical
path rocky . till, finally his .undeniable wit
had put every 4 bne in good humor.
â¢ The opinion pt the members, however,
was made up. &nd r an. eloquent: peroration
of General Ford carried the, last ram
parts. A rising and sitting >vote showed
123 members for the amalgamation to
forty-eight against it."

CHESTNUT AT 200 TO I
DEFEATS JERRY HUNT
Mandator, a 25 to 1
Shot, Wins the
Handicap.
H. Radtke, the Keene
Pilot, Displays
Fine Form.
BY FRED E. MULHOLLAM).
The hidden element termed luck helped
Chestnut, a 200 to 1 shot, win the first
race on the programme yesterday at
IngJeÃide.
Chestnut iv a three-year-old colt by
Tim Toolin from Four Flush, trained by
Bill Murry- He was ridden by H. Smith
and in a drivinsr flnien,led out the battte
icarred old -warrior Jerry Hunt a neck.
Then another Impossibility, May Holla
Â£ay. ran third. Hew these things occur
it is diSicult to explain. Run the race
over thirty different times and the
chances are Chestnut would not land. An
explanation gees wrapped up with every
s-hort-priced horse.
JOCKEY FOUXTAIX* EXPLAINS.
Fountain said he got caught in a jam
at the start with El Piloto. Optimo, a
railbird alarm, failed to arrive on sched
ule time, but his driver League phoned
that everything would be straightened
out at some other time. Barker had 16
to 1 painted against his name, and his
showing warranted it. Teddy Robinson,
on tlie back of the favorite, Lerida, did
a. short Indian-club exercise, fried a duck
egg sandwich with one hand over a Chi
nese lam*> while juggling three South
Sea Island cocoanuts with the other, drew
his whip, then placed It back in the
scabbard and finished fourth. Bard Burns
was pulled up and Bellentoy got left.
Perhaps that wouldn't make an oyster
opener come in on no pair. CAestnut re
ceived backing from a scattering few.
Almost as big- a surprise was the cap
ture of the Hastings handicap run over
six furlongs by the Keene Bros, entry,
Mandator, a two-year-old. The youngster
was conceding lumps of weight to most
of the other starters, and his price drifted
from 10 to 25 to 1. When it looked as if
Xigrette would get home in front, Radtke
came with a rush on the two-year-old,
winning the verdict by nearly two
lengths. Tocolaw ran third.
FOUR FAVORITES SCORE.
Only horses with a known fondness' for
mud were accorded genuine support, and
the talent did some good picking. Four
favorites won.
N'ealon, the good Sain colt from the
stable of Barney Schrelber. captured the
j wo-year-old purse sprint. He was ridden
by Radtke and was a. l-to-2 favorite and
l&at the two long shots, Queen Rec and
War Wheel, with apparent ease.
Huge bundles of coin were unloaded
on Buchanan, another son of Sain, from
the Schrelber string, to win the mile and
a sixteenth selling fixture- It proved
just as good a thing as it was cracked
up to be, for the black gelding spread
eagled his field. Bird of Passage, a 60-to
1 shot, downed the second choice. Briers,
for the place.
Humes & Co. picked up another purse
with Yo San. Although favorite, the books
chalked a liberal Quotation about the
marÂ« in the betting on the five furlong
selling number. 6he disposed of a flock
of eleven mudlarks, like breaking sticks.
Bucolic snatched the place from the 30
to-1 outsider. Forerunner.
XOTISS OF THE TRACK.
It didn't take Radtke long to strike his
gait. The Keene lightweight piloted three
v inners yesterdayâ Nealon, Buchanan and
Mandator.
There is no teljing what might have
happened a person that accosted Jack
Keene for a small loan after Mandator
had won the handicap. Jack didn't think
the two-year-old capable of conceding so
much weight and wished to scratch him.
He was talked out of the notion by
Judge Hopper, and later had the pleasure
of seeing the youngster parade home
with only a fifty-dollar show bet down.
Louis Schumacher, which fell at the
head of the etretch In the second race,
hurst a blood vessel, dying In a few min
utes. J. de la Montanya recently pur
chased the two-year-eld from Keene
Eros. -
M. A. Gunst, the well-known tobacco
nist and capitalist, strung a few dollars
across the board on Chestnut. Mose needs
the money, and his friends were pleased
id see htm ca*h. Vj.;-; \u25a0
Jerry Hunt Is only nine years old. He
has one leg that resembles a golf stick,
but appears to be right in line for a purse.
Carlolly and Ulcuna, two starters yes
terday spdrting the colors of the . Bobre
Vista stable, are owned by the million
aire turf admirer, Rudolph Spreckeli. Mr.
Spreckels has heretofore confined his at
tention to polo racing, and his advent as
an out-and-out turfman would be wel
comed with delight by followers of the
thoroughbred.
There were rumors about that the third
was to be a boat race, and that Briers
â¢end Lone Wolf were in the pickling vat.
If euch was the case credit must be given ,
lor picking such a good one out to "shoo
tn."
It li fashionable these days to boost a
winner. J. de-la Montanya bid up Bu
chanan from J630 to SHOO without securing
the gelding. The- fact must not be over
looked in this instance though that Bird
of Passage, which ran second, is owned
.by Mr. De la Montanya.
The Oakland stable cold Rey Dare yes
terday to W. M. Hawke. for; $KK>.. Later
in the afternoon the. former' concern
bought Quizz II from Charley McCafferty.
Red Cross Nurse, owned by D.' : A.- Ross
and trained by George Wentworth, died |
at Oakland track yesterday from fever, j
lEhlana, from the came stable, died only
a few days ago. Both mares were cam
paigned through Utah,' Colorado, <Mon
iar.a end Washington last summer.
"Boots" Durnell is now the owner of i
Toupee, Charley McCafferty accepting
$2000 for the gelding.
Jim JCell is no longer owner of Rumore.
Me sold the gelding to Joseph Blum yes- j
terday. '
Handlcapper Horace Egbert was absent
from the track yesterday, being confined
to hia home with an attack of the grip.

PpauUtng, a member ct the recently appointed
California Stanford Investigating aid rules
committee, have requested my co-operation. "I

kinds bearing on the development of the sport
and its faults and favorable features. That
record I can fcupnlement with my personal ob
servations and written accounts of the fifteen

basis, a similar, record can be compiled at

l - . J interest is being;
t;. ,'/.-.Â«; -fl. pecially as the word,
he mat. Fitzsimmons is In j
get. ' .. . j
Th:. .. vj ihe point upon which thej
drawing power of the match rested. As j
the ring veteran has done all that wasj
asked of him in training his friends think i
his chances for. carrying off the long end |
of the purse are excellent.
â¢In' what betting was done yesterday
Fiizsimmons . was the public choice at
odds of 8 to 10. Not a great. volume of
money \u25a0 was handled at that price, but
heavy wasering is expected to-day. S<r
much Interest was displayed yesterday
that it will probably prove the biggest
bâ¬ttlng fight in some years. 1 â¢
The sporting men find it difficult to
figure out the result. They seem to think
that O'Brien has such a big advantage in
age that he should be a 9 to 10 choice.
The Philadelphian was two years old
when -Fitzsimmons crawled through the
ropes ef a New Zealand ring for his first
fight. Â»
Fitzsimmons was born in 1862 and had
his first ring experience In ISSO. O'Brien
was born in IS7S and had his first' fight In
1596, sixteen years after Fitzsimmons
made his debut. O'Brien has a formid
able list of victories to his credit, but
they, are over such ' men -as Kid Carter,
Jack Bonner, Mike Scneck.'. Al Welnig,
Joe Gr!m, John Wille and such human
punching bags. O'Brien met | Choynski,
Maher, Hart, Walcott and others In 1903
when all except Hart were practically
down and out. - .
Fltzslmraons met Jack Dempsey in IS9I,
Jlaher and Godfrey in 1532, Choynski and
Creedon in 18JM, V Sharkey lii : ISD6.' Corbett
In 1597. He met Jeffries for, the first time
In 1599 and was defeated in eleven rounds.
This indicates that the- class In to
night's fight rests with' Fitzsimmons. His
age is the factor ;'which is expected to
cut; the^ largest figure in determining the
result. The bettors seem to have thrown
out : his fight with Gardner, which he won.
however, "conceding .that he I was out of
condition 'that: night. His showing then
was' considered bad.
\u25a0If is a tradition of the. ring that, the
old-timer does v not ' recuperate after a
fast round or two when the excitement
of ; competition . makes -'a - heavy drain on
the 'Vitality. '\u25a0>. Whether Fitzsimmons, who
stands out above all other fighters as. a
marvelously well preserved athlete, will
prove the exception to the rule remains to
be seen. 4 '
" .Both fighters* took matters easily yes
terday,, "doing only- enough exercise to
hold the condition they have so labor
iously â¢ built' * up ."'during their long ' spell
of training. |Â§H9SBfiEBEPBvI9fe
\u25a0iTh'e'men have agreed to be In the ring
at" 9:10 p-m. and ' Billy Jordan will be cx 7
pected to luse his diplomacy : in ' keeping
them up to their word; Fitzsimmons com
plains", that ": he was r allowed to cool ' his
heels in '\u25a0 the ring at Philadelphia when
they met before \ and that it affected ' his
fighting .qualities.^; This time he plans
to ,box several rounds in his dressing
roomY just before he > enters . the ring,^ on
the;same principal that a horse ia breezed
through the ' stretch ", before a race as a

i.uo tone of freight and 100 passengers,
in epite or high seas and a Succession
of gales the Alameda came up from the
island port in J, days 18 hours. This
Â« the Alamoda's first round trip since
she made her famous visit to Fort
Point, and at Honolulu she received a
â¢welcome such os the islanders never be
fot# accorded a vessel of any kind. As
sSie entered the harbor every whist,le.in
the port lifted its \Soiee In a shrill
"How de do' and all Honolulu flocked
to the wharf in honor of the Alamedas
return.
For the purpose of insuring prompt
dispatch through quarantine here and
at foreign ports of vessels calling at
the islands the health regulations at
Honolulu are very strict and art strict
ly enforced' by the Federal authorities.
1- or refusal ' to regard the quarantine
restrictions fifteen members of the
Alameda's rrcw were paid off at the
island port and will remain there until
they eeofit to observe the Marine Hos
pital requirements. .
Members of tnecfexv were forbidden
by Captain DoTvrdell to go ashore at
Honolulu. This rule Is enforced on all
liners calling at the island port. Eight
men from the steward's department and
seven of the engine-room- crew dis
obeyed the order, rushed the guard and
look in the sights of Honolulu. Rush
ing ashore was only a matter of crowd
ing past a lone quartermaster. When
it came to rushing- back the truants
found they; were up against interfer
ence in the shape of Uncle Sam. Uncle
Sam won.' - -
The men-appealed to Captain Dow
dell, who said they must either submit
to be fumigated, disinfected and any
thing else, the _ Federal regulations
might require or stay ashore. They
declined the quarantine treatment, so
were paid off and .other men were en
gaged to fill "their places on the Ala
meda.
The Aiameda's passengers included
the following: Miss K. McCarthy, Miss
E. Suter, Mrs. J. D. Jewett and two
sons, H. Trimble. A. Betteridge. Miss
Madrlire Ross. Itonald Ross, W. L.

SUITABLE SITE
FOR MONUMENT
Park Commissioners at Next
;\u25a0 Meeting May Determine
Where Group Shall Stand
JOHN McLAEM'S PLACE
No Indication That Capable
Superintendent Wjll Lose
the Position He Now Holds
The Board of -Park- Commissioners jat
the meeting; will probably deter
mine where the* monument to, the Califor
nia volunteers lof - the Spanish-American
war will be Ideated. The plans for the
monument, duly approved, and' the money
for^materiarand construction are in the
hands of the trustees. ' A site on Van
Neg9 avenue seems. to be favored by the
promoters of the . . mdnunie'nt. but. the
Park Commissioners will give the sub
ject thorough consideration before â¢ a
final decision is rendered.
, When â¢ the design was \u25a0 placed before the
board for approval, a proposition In favor
Of fixing the site 'on Van Ness avenue
and Pine street was rejected on the
ground that a monument would impair
the beauty and utility of the avenue.
Since ttjen pressure has been Invoked to
declare the intersection of Market street
and Van Ness avenue an ideal location.
Gossip in political camps concerning the
superintendency of ' parka and the; hints*
that some, political fortune seeker is
slated for .thÂ« which John Me-.
Laren now holds are not seriously con
sidered by , the- "Park- Commissioners.
Moreover, it is said 'that the Mayor has
the highest regard for Mr. McLaren's ac
complishments as a landscape architect
and ' park builder. It S is probable that a
more lucrative position. than secretary of

AMATEUBS PLEASE IN
SHAKESPEAEEAN PLAY
Benefit for Doctor's Daugh
ters Again Draws Fashion
able Crowd.
"The Merchant of Venice," so admir
ably given by amateur players for the
benefit of the Doctor's Daughters, was
magnetic enough to draw another great
throng of fashionables to the Majestic
Theater yesterday afternoon.
The presentation of Shakespeare's
comedy .. by non-professionals was .In it
self enough to attract attention and sup
port, but the fact, too, of its . production
for bo worthy a cause has been sufficient
to bring out a vast army of the good
natured souls of San Francisco. When
the results shall be made known in a
few days, it is anticipated that a hand
some sum will have been realized.
So admirable a performance has created
much favorable . comment around town.
The Shylock of Richard M. Hotaling, the
Lorenzo : of , Joseph J. Rosborough, and
the Launcelot Gobbo of Alfred I. McKin
non have loomed up as a surprise. The
Antonio of John I. Housman. the Bassa
nlo of J. Allan Dunn and the Duke of
Venice by "Edgar D. Pelxotto have won
no less .encomiums, while . the Gratiano
played by Harry E. de Lasaux, Solanio
by Emerson Warfleld, and Salarino by
"William Melander have been stamped
I with merited approval. Others among
the male characters who have gained
reputations for good work are C. B. Sloan,
who essayed the part of Old Gobbo;
Charles Wlllams as Tubal. Sydney H. !
W. Ford as Balthasar, Thomas Miller as
Leonardo 7 and James Cunningham as
Stephano. Miss Hilda Clough as Portia
and Mrs. Mark ' Gerstle "as -Jessica have
established themselves as among the
foremost local amateurs. Miss Olga Ath
erton gave much grace to the part of
Nerlssa. '
The Doctor's Daughters are desirous
of returning thanks to the public for
the 'generous patronage and support
given the entertainment.
They also desire to announce that
tickets for the, doll-house raffle and
talking machine raffle may be obtained
at Sloane's, Sherman & Clay's and from
any member of the Doctor's Daughters.
The sale will continue till January 1.
PRINTERS' ENTERTAINMENT
PROVES A GREAT SUCCESS
Benefit for" the Elsbt-Hoar Working
Day Dram Big Crowd to Native
Sons' Hall.
The entertainment and dance given
last night at; Native Sons' Hall by t the
Sari Francisco Typographical Union
for the benefit of the eight-hour day
was a great "success. The hall was
packed and the programme proved very
high-class. "A dance followed, "and
the big crowd made merry till an early
hour.
Will J. French, president of ..the
union, opened . the entertainment with
a speech, in which he explained
to the audience how the printers had
been struggling for years for an eight
hour law. He told of how every printer
in the country would be compelled* to
uphold this law after the new year, and
this .would probably result, in strikes.
The unions all over the country were
contributing to the fund and San Fran
cisco Representatives are upholding
their end.
Mr! French was followed by the El
Solitaire quartet, which rendered sev
eral-choice .selections. Little Mande-^
ville' Towne, scored; a great hit with
her ;? Shakespearean characterizations.
Mrs., E.F. Lunsf or'd, rendered two con
tralto solos. Miss Mary G. Coffin played
"Cavallerla Rusticana" on the -, violin;
.\u25a0William' Boyer, the gifted tenor, be
came popular wit.^ his , songs. Miss
Ethel Hobart and her chlldlmpersona
tions and R. B. Hawkins, "the whistling
printer."' completed the ' programme
with excellent numbers.
Butcher Boy Keeps Cheek.
Abe Meyer, a boy employed by a
butcher on Folsom street, was arrested
yesterday on a warrant charging him
with misdemeanor embezzlement. Miss
Sarah Ellison, 1014 Golden: Gate ave
nue, "- is the complaining witness. \ Her
father deals with the butcher and she
gave Meyer ; a check for $7 to get
cashed for her. : Meyer turned the check
over to his employer, because he said
Miss' Ellison's- father; owed 'a. bill for
meat. .Miss EUson says she has noth
ing: to do with her father's accounts
and the check' was her own personal
property! Meyer was released on $10
cash bail. 4 \ J \u25a0
Say* Negress Took Coin.
While he was under the hypnotic
spell of Clara Jarman" lastinlght A. S.
Laurin declares - that ; he lost ia 1 pocket
book containing $150 In greenbacks. He
stopped ;to \ converse ,with the Jarman
woman.l who ;is not quite \u25a0as black as
theace of ; spades, but almost. During
the, tete-a-tetei he declares, 'the l- $150
evaporated.' ;The woman was arrested
by Policeman Lankman ; and , booked at
the ; City, Prison â¢ for â¢ grand . larceny.

SAVORY HAGGIS
IS DISCUSSED
Caledonians Gather at For
tieth Annual Dinner of
Their Famous Organization
DECOEATIOXS AETISTIC
Flag of Scotland With the
Stars and Stripes on Each
Side Hangs Above the Chief
The Caledonian Club held a banquet at
the Occidental Hotel last night to cele
brate the fortieth anniversary of lv or
ganization. Nearly 200 members, with
their wlvaa or sweethearts, attended,
and the affair was conceded to be the
most enjoyable and successful In thÂ«*
club's history. The dining-room was ar-Â»
tlstically decorated, the color scheme be^-*
Ing red and yellow. The flag of Scoland,
with the lion rampant, was on the wail
behind the presiding officer, flanked on
each side by the stars and strlpA.
> The menu was elaborate and In the
Occidental chef's best style. It included
the time-honored haggis, which was car
ried Into the dining-room, preceded by
Pipers Nell Lindsay and Ed Ross, play-
Ing "Hail to the Chief." When the menu
was exhausted and the toddy put in cir
culation. Chief D. D. McÃae, master of
ceremonies, proposed In succession the
toasts of "The President of the United
States" and 'The King." The toast of
"The Land "We Left" was responded to
by J. D. McGilvray in a speech breathing
of love for the land of the heather and
recounting the prominent positions taken
by Scotchmen on the American continent
in all the walks of life. He referred with
pleasure to the, fact that the Caledonian
Club had given $1000 to the fund for the
erection of a monument to Robert Burns
In Golden Gate Park, and was cheered
when he said that the erection of the
monument "was no longer problematical,
but an assured fact.
"The Land We Uve In" was responded
to by Judge George H. Cabaniss In a
way that aroused the utmost enthusiasm.
He spoke of the boast of the Romans
that wherever they happened to be, they
were proud of the fact that they could
say. "We are Roman citizens." So in the
present day Americans, wherever they
happened to be, were proud of the fact
that they were American citizens, wheth
er by birth or by adoption.
Other toasts responded to were "Sister <*
Societies" by George W. Paterson^ chief
of the Scottish Thistle Club; "Universal
Brotherhood," by John Mulhern, presi
dent Knights "of St. Patrick: "The Press."
by- Charles Morrison, and~"The Ladles,"
by G. A. Dougald. .It was in the "wee
sma" hoors o* . the morning" that the
singing of "Auld Lang Syne" concluded
the programme. Between the speeches
songs were rendered by Malcolm Morri
son and Mrs. Daisy Keane Killogely;
recitations by Alexander Smith; pipe
; music by Pipers .Neil Lind3ay and Ed .
Ross, and selections by an orchestra.
The officers of the* club are:. Chief.
; D. D. McÃae: first chieftain, D. J. Mc-
Farland; second chieftain. F. F. Flnlay;
third chieftain, James H. Duncan; fourth
chieftain, J. W. Cameron, and physician.
Dr. J. A. ' J. McDonald. The committee
having charge' of the banquet were the
officers of the club and A. *M. Macpher
son, Charles Macdonald. W. P. Grant.*.

The Weather cad Crop*.
ThÂ« raUy report of A, G. McAdie, section
director of the climate and crop service of
tne Weather Bureau, is as follo-ws:
GENERAL NUMMARY*.
The weather continued cooi and clear during
the first part of the week in the central and
northern auctions and warm and clear In the
â¢outh. Cloudy and utsettled weather pre
vailed toward thÂ« CloÂ»a of the week and light
rain fell in nearly s.ll sections on the l&ta
*nd JTth. FroetÂ» occurred frequently, but
c&usea no d&ciace.
The cool weather and unusually light rain
tail in the central and northern sections are
â¢erlously retarding farm work and the growth
of early sown gnijn and pasturage. The soil
cas not been thoroughly saturated this season
and la too dry for profitable cultivation. Hes.vy
rains and warmer weather would cause a
decided improvement in conditions, with fair
prospects of good crops. The outlook in the
coast districts and in Southern California, is
very rr.ueii tetter than la the great valleys.
Grain :â¢ up and making fair growth and new
range feed is in gooJ condition, though need
leg rain In some places. Dry feed and hay
are plentiful, but in roost sections Cattle axe ;
mm and in poor condition. Plowing and seed- â¢
ing continue in some placest
The high winds at the close of the pre
ceding week undoubtedly caused considerable
danmge to Southern California oranges and
olives, but no definite reports have yet been
â¢ received. Oranges and olives are being gath
ered and large shipments of these fruits and
raisins are being made for the holiday trade.
SACRAMENTO V ALLEY.â CooI and pÂ»rUy
cloudy weather prevailed during the week,
kvlih frequent heavy frosts and northerly
r~* Inds. Light rain fell on Friday and Sunday,
slightly improving farming conditions. It fol
lowed soon by heavier Tain and warm weather
U.e {>rospecta for crops will still be quite good.
The soil is very dry and needs copious rains.
Early sown wheat is not up and neif range
feed has not started sufficiently for good
pasturage. Hay is still plentiful, but cattle
are thin and in poor condition. Plowing and
seeding are very backward and moat farmers
are waiting for generous rain? before putting
in their crops. Orange harvest continues and
good shipments* are being made; thÂ« crop is
about average.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â CIear and
cool weather prevailed during the first of the
week, with frosts In most places, and cloudy,
unsettled * weather from TbursdAy. until the
close of the week. Rain fell in ! nearly | all
sections Friday and Sunday, but in many
places was too light to be of great benefit.
Heavy rains are needed soon for early grain
"and grass. Plowing end seeding are progre*s
lr.j? and some work is being done In orchards
end vineyards. Pasturage is not making much
growth ana cattle are generally in poor con
dition. Coid weather and frosts have caused
no damage except in retarding growth of praia
and f â¢ â¢-\u25a0\u25a0-!. Oranees continue In good condition

SAN JOAQXIN* VALLEY. â Fair. cool
weather prevailed during the forepart of the
past week and srneral'.y c'.oudy and some
what warmer weather the latter portion, with
lig-lit rain In the extreme northern portion of
the valley Friday night and light rain over
the entire valley Sunday Eight. Heavy frosts

portion ot the week, but caused 00 damag*.
OiSve picking Is progressing favorably in the !
central portf on of the -valley. Pruning Is ~>ro

NEW YORK, Dec. 19. â^There was no
kvikher ttÂ»c* In ths etock market to-day of
VÂ°sterday's hysterical nt over the Chicago
bank failures. BpeculaUve holders who had
been rÂ»Â«-pt oflt their feet seemed to have their
c^nipeeure restored or to have given place
to other holders of a" firmer determination.
It was asserted in fact that the shaking out

Elump KM benefited the market. There" was
evidence aleo of some requirements to cover
shorts which presumably were the after
results of yesterday's attack on the market,
fcuch hesitation and uncertainty as were man
ifest In the market were traceable to con
ditions normal to the closing period of the

the Chicago bank failures seemed- to be rele

: ability was discussed that the clearing-house
settlement of the ,dlfficultyrproyosed might
involve the tying up of considerable resources ;
with possible effect on . the money situation
during the turn of the year. The decline in |
"activity in the market was partly, attributable
CO the approach of the holidays and the normal :
disposition at that time to clear Up com
mitments, although the" proposition to close
the Stock E-nchange for an extra hÂ£Â»<lay Â° n
Saturday seemed to find no favor. The sharp
break in People's Gas was attributed by rumor
to a liquidation growing out of thÂ» Chicago
failures and increased a disposition to take
profits all through the market. Prices were
carried considerably below the best and in
consequence some of the important gains were
t completely wiped out. The closing was easy.

George B. Keane, for the last four years
private secretary to Mayor Schmltz, yes
terday afternoon accepted the position
of clerk to the new Board of Supervisors
to succeed Charles W. Fay, who has held
the position for the last six years. Keane
was offered the- place some weeks ago,
but was reluctant about accepting It, and
this gave rise to the rumor that another
would receive the plum. ,
But Schmltz and Ruef finally j persuaded
Keane to take the job, and yesterday he
yielded to their wishes. When the news
was made known, J. George Boyne,
George Benham and Thomas Atkinson
withdrew f rom . the fight and congratu
lated their successful' rival.' .'
,The clerkship pays a salary of $300 a
month, while the secretaryship - which
Keane held pays J2OO. The clerkship 's
one of the most Important positions in
the City Hall and carries with it a great
deal of responsibility. Fay filled it to
the satisfaction of everybody and made
a great many friends around the hall.
It ' seems a strange coincidence that
the secretary of the Mayor is destined to
become the clerk to the Board of Super
visors." Fay was Phelan's secretary be
fore he got the position/and now comes
Keane out of the .Mayor's office to fol
low In the footsteps of the man whom he
is. about to succeed./ " â¢
Mayor Schmitz has not yet decided
upon Keane's successor.. He has several
competent men In view, and rumor has
it that he will appoint his brother Her
bert, who is now secretary to the Park
Commissioners, to fill the vacancy. Sev
eral others would like to' secure the bil
let,' but they will all be kept In suspense
for a few days till the Mayor reaches a
decision. , -
Keane is well known as a politician and
lawyer. He graduated from the Hastings
Law , College several ' years \ ago and en
tered \u25a0 Ruef 's , office. .He has been " asso
ciated . with the political boss ' of : the
Union Labor party since 1897, and for
some time has been a flower In the Re
publican ranks in the Forty-second Dis
trict, having been elected a State Senator
from there at I the election held In 1904.

splendid rendering of a favorite oper

classics alone thatÂ« Mr. Dusslng's- mag
nificent barytone ': shows to advantage,
but in the simpler ballads his voice
strikes a sympathetic chord which ap
peals strongly to his hearers. In him
the Techau Tavern has secured an ar
tist of high class and this musical
treat in connection with their | splendid
service - and : excellent cuisine will help

WHISKY MAY
CAUSE DEATH
Austrian Laborer Imbibes
Two Quarts of Beverage
Ere He Fills Unconscious
NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE
Physicians at the Hospital
Say Man Must Have Drunk
the Liquor in a Hurry
George Grahovoc,; '-, an Austrian laborer
employed at the Southern Pacific" camp
No. 1, located on the route of the new
cut oft near San Bruno,' last night drank
two Quart bottles of j whisky, and now. lies
at death's door at ( the Central Emer
gency^Hospital. The doctors say that; the
man cannot ; recover. â¢ He was, picked up
in ah unconscious ; condition " and has no*t
yet regained ' his senses. .
Grahovoc was found by some of .* his
bellow workmen shortly after the supper
hour, last: night inhts tent.; Close beside
him' lay,; two empty whisky^ bottles. The
man's breath fairly, reeked with the smell
of the liquor, and as there was no ; one
with him at the time it is- known beyond
: a doubt that he drank all the whisky
, himself.. '- : v ,js,t;.> >; . - v,,
When examined by the doctors at the
hospital the man .was found to be suffer
ing from ; acute alcoholism and his heart
was beating, but faintly. There were.no
signs | of drugs or knockout drops, bo :thie
doctors are of the opinion tuat the unfor
tunate laborers simply drank and drank
till he fell into; a stupor. ,',,; "
Such a performance . Is very unusual.;
The doctors cannot understand how a hu-i
man ' being could possibly . sit' down" and
toss off - two .full . quarts of wnisky.' | Yet
Grahovoc managed -to accomplish . this
feat and did it In a short space of time,
for he was found soon 'after he had en
tered his tent.'
Snya He Is Wanted In Denver.
FrankCassldy, 23 years of age, went
up to Policeman Jordan yeÃterday
morning and said he wanted to sur
render h lm sel f as he had committed
two burglaries In Denver. , Jordan^took
him to the City, Prison, where- he , was
questioned -by Detective Bell. He told
Bell -he^and j a ' companion' had broken
Into ... two .residences* In /Denver" In
August, 1904, oneiat '.Walnut . and'. Thlr-;
tleth streets and the other at Twenty.
elghth street and Emerson avenue.* He
had, .he said, been attending the Salva
tion Army meetings and that had led
him .to give himself up. Captain Bur
nett wired the I Denver authorities.
Cassidy does not seem to be all' right
mentally. Captain -Burnett received a
reply that Cassidy was . not wanted
there and that no such burglaries 'had
been committed. Cassidy was released
from custody. . ,
