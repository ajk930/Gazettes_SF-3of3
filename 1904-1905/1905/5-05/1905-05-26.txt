AFTER THE LOSS
OF $15,000,000
The whole .affair was carefully, or
galzed. The . leaders were ; supplied .with
the addresses of the owners of disreputa
ble houses and not a single Jewish resort
In Wargaw escaped destruction.
Another report has it that .Jewish
roughs in the guise of members of the
Bund were levying blackmail upon shop
keepers, thus enraging the Socialists. In
any case the Socialists seemingly deter
mined upon \u25a0a : crusade agalnsti' the unde
sirable, persons of. their own race, with
the result that crowds of men and boys
are now systematically ruining the dis
reputable houses.
Extraordinary scenes . were witnessed
late to-night, when , the crowds . visited
the better section of the city and demol
ished apartments : filled with costly, ef
fects. The mob in the streets left open
spaces for the falling articles, and then
completed the., work of destruction. .-In
one olace a quantity of valuable Jewelry
was taken. out. and deliberately smashed
with atones.
There' has been no pillage,; but the
destruction, of /disreputable houses con
ducted ; by. Jews has been complete. 'It
was to' rid the city of the undesirable
element of its own 5 race that the.JewUa.
Bund, composed- of Jews of the better
class, last j night- ; began the ;.' attack'
upon the quarters of the disrueputables.
The latter offered, battle, and thecom-:
bat continued throughout. the night. ; It
is believed that the casualties are much
greater than the official figures show,
as scores of wounded persons ' were
taken to their homes instead of to the
hospitals.
Throuhout the night mobs, armed with
axes, smashed the doors and windows of
disreputable resorts and took the furni
ture out In -the streets, where they, broke
it into small pieces. - The owners, of the
furniture, in attempting to defend their
belongings ' were attacked, beaten and
even killed. Knives and revolvers were
used freely and some of the dead were
terribly mutilated.
Late to-night the authorities took their
first step to check the riots when the
Cossacks fired upon crowds at two points,
wounding four persons. During the day
patrols of Cossacks had occasionally ap
peared, but they witnessed the proceed
ings merely as spectators.
The character of the disturbance is un
precedented. The whole affair is a con
flict between the respectable Jewish So
cialist classes and the disreputable Jew
ish element. There are conflicting stories
as to the origin of the trouble. One re
port is to the effect that the, respectable
Jews, tired of hearing the members of
their race called keepers of disorderly
houses, thieves and usurers and other op
probious names, resolved, as the police
were receiving bribes for protecting dis
reputable houses and persons, to take the
law into their own hands.
The combat was begun last night and
until to-night the authorities made no
Attempt to â¢ restore order. While the
fighting proceeded not a policeman was
in sight. Occasionally, when crowds
not composed of Jews would gather, a
squad of police would move out from
some rendezvous and disperse them and
then retire immediately: Apparently
it was the Intention of the authorities
to let the combatants wear themselves
out ? ,^; - . \u25a0 \u25a0. - â¢ '\u25a0\u25a0,\u25a0\u25a0.
WARSAW, May 25 Efsht persons
fcave been killed and more than 100
wounded in the atreÂ«t fighting;, between
Jews in this city and the battle is still
In progress. Of the wounded more than
a score will die. Late to-night patrol
wasrons were still bringing In bodies
of the dead or. taking wounded men to
the hospitals.
The report was also given out yesterday
that.E. S. Bensoa. auditor of tue South
ern Pacific lines In Texas and formerly
auditor of the Oregon Railroad and Navi
gation Company, has resigned to accept
the position of auditor of the Isthmian
Canal Commission:
What disposition will be made of Har
riman's cabinet of traffic, operating and
maintenance and purchase and supplies
directors in Chicago has not been learned.
It is. however, a question if changes in
these departments will be necessary, for
the legal talent of the Harriman syndi
cate has not yet decided whether the
continuance of these directors Is a viola
tion of public policy as construed in the
recent decision In the merger case.
Efforts to get from James Agler a state
ment as to what his future plans are ut
terly failed yesterday, for he refused to
say, but it was common report around the
railroad offices ths* he had been consid
ering an offer from President A. W. Fos
ter of the California Northwestern Rail
way to accept the position of general
manager of that line, as well as the North
Ehore. it being generally understood that
General James Fraser, who is still a very
tick man, will not be able to renew'activ
ity in the railroad world for many months
to come.
According to the reports that have
reached the higher officials. of the South
ern Pacific Company in this city, vice
President and General Manager Calvin
will become the president of that corpora
tion, with his -headquarters in this city;
A. L. Mphler. vice president and general
manager of the Union Pacific, will be
elected president of that company, with
future headquarters in Omaha; W. jH.
Bancroft will be. promoted to the presi
dency of the Oregon Short Line and some
one. possibly General Superintendent
Park of the Union Pacific or General Su
perintendent Buckingham of the Oregon
Short Line will be made president of the
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
panyj a position which would probably
hzve fallen to B. A. 'VVorthington had be
tiot recently resigned his place as vice
president and general manager.
With the selection of high operating of
ficials for the presidencies of the Harri
man lines it is regarded as uncer
tain as to whether the positions of gen
eral managers will be continued, and if
they are it is expected that many promo
tions will be made and probably much
new blood injected into the administra
tive affairs cf the four roaus.
AGLER'S FUTURE PLAA'.S.
The report was as thoroughly discussed
in the Southern Pacific offices yesterday
as was the depos'.ng cf Manager Agler.
Biiehy, it is to the effect that E. IL
Harriman and his associates in the 1 , con
tro! of the Western railroads, taking
varinrg from the. recent decision of the
United States Supreme Court in the fa
mous merger case, have decided to elect
sepÂ«; rate presidents and Doards of direc
tou= for cacp of their roads, and that the
first step to t>e taken in this direction
will be made shortly, when Harriman,
who is vow president of the fourrcom
pfttUe* that compose his network ;of* lines,
v.ili resign , from all of these' positions to
later Wcome chairman of an executive
bourd that will be created at the proper
time in New York.
CALVIX IS 3IEXTIOXED.
Following the retirement of James A.
Agler as manager of the Western Eys
tem ef the Southern Pacrflc Company and
the reorganization of the divisions cf
the road into two districts, the local
railroad world has been further stirred
up by a report that the entire executive
department cf the bis Karriman syndicate
is i-ocn to be remodeled.
.The belief 'here is that Stephens', mind
and body .w ere weakened by slow starva
tion. It was known to ' a , few that - the
family just barely kept alive for, several
months. Little Josephine unconsciously
betrayed the straitened circumstances of
the family.^aÃ^l
The child walked every ' day from her
home to school in San Rafael, a distance
of three miles, and she did, the: family
shopping. Her dally purchase ?at r tha
butcher shop was . 10 ;; cents' : worth of
"scraps -for the chickens." . Now ,; it is .
certain that those "scraps'*, were for the
S tephena family. ; There \u25a0 are many who
can.' tell' how they tried to give .little
things : to -the family, but \u25a0 Mrs. Stephens
looked upon all offers of assistance, how
ever delicately made.. as. insults. *f
. Josephine was - a favorite with her
teacher at the San Rafael grammar
school and was regarded as an extremely
bright child. ' Her seat in the . school has
been draped by her little classmates and
covered ~ with flowers.

that the difficulties would be settled.

? The ''point hinges ' on whether a deputy
is an" officer within the* meaning of the
section noted. That he is would appear
from the language of section 60 of the
county government act, 'which says:
"Whenever . the, official name of any
principal officer is used in any law con
ferring power or imposing duties or lia
bilities it Includes 'deputies.' "
: Tax Collector Scott was looking np the
law on the subject yesterday, and he
considers that the constitution clearly
limits the term of city officials, including
deputies, to four years.
"It seems to me," said Scott, "that the
deputies will cease to be employes of the
city when they have been four years in
its service.' Of course, the law could be
technically complied with by reappoint
ing the deputies for another term of four
years. But then, on the other hand, the
point Is raised that -a new -civil service
examination would * have : to J be held â¢ for
the formation ; , of a new > eligible, list
from ; which new appointments ; should be
made. Â« No doubt the matter will be. made
the subject for judicial determination. -as
the constitution appears to be clear on
the point." /,
When the \ term ' of, any offlfcer -. er \ CbmmiS;
sloner la not. provided ton in this constitution,
the term of such officer or Commtssiprier may
be declared by law; and if not so declared,
such officer or Commissioner â¢ shall hold hla
position ; during ' the ; pleasur^ *ol *MÂ® authority

such tÂ«rin exceed four years.' \u25a0â¢ t" *
The deputies in the Tax Collector's of
fice are much ' perturbed over a report
that has been spread to the effect that
preparations are under way for the pur
pose of determining whether the State
constitution limits their tenure of office
to four years. The deputies are fifteen in
number and are all civil service em
ployes, and if the provision . of the con
stitution holds the terms of most of the
deputies will expire In August of this
year. The constitution provides. In,, sec

ST. PETERSBURG, May 25.-Admiral
Avellan. head of the Russian Admiralty
Department, confirms the press dis
patches saying Vice Admiral Rojestven
' sky is steaming northward to give battle
to Admiral Togo. He considtrs it possi
ble that news that the two fleets have
!met will be received any day.
'The Japanese," said the admiral,
"cannot afford to allow Rojestvensky to
reach Vladivostok without- an engage
ment. I personally expect it to take
place in the near future, though I admit
the Admiralty knows nothing of Rojest
vens-ky's strategy or plans, the Emperor
having accorded him complete freedom
of uction."

might intentionally allow RoJcstvenEky,
to get to Vladivostok, contenting himself
w!t!i torpedo attacks while the Russians
are on tn#ir way thither, and then try

Smith was among them, but when he
reached land he was insane. He finally
reached New York and recovered his
reason, but he had forgotten : the de
posit in San Francisco. Some time ago
he met one of the men who, had been
with him when he made the deposit and
was reminded of it. Then the memory
of it came back to him.
LOS ANGELES, May 25.-â ln a suit
flled in the, Superior Court to-day Ms
told a weird story of thfe scramble for
fortune in the early days of California.
Of the wreck of the 111-fated steamship
Golden Gate with her load of treasure
and human freight, of an insane man's
wanderings for almost half a century
and of his final discovery that, a de
posit which he made in San Francisco
before the Civil War has now grown
from (2500 to $35,000. If is to recover
this money that the legal action la be
gun and the case promises to be a
most interesting one. Alexander Smlthi
aged S3. is the plaintiff and- the Sav
ings and Loan Society of San Francisco
is the defendant. It . is probable that
the case will; be transferred to the
San Francisco courts.
Smith came to California In ISSO and
amassed a fortune of $20,000 In tile
mines near Nevada City. During a
visit to San Francisco he . deposited
$2500 with the savings society and left
It there. Three friends accompanied
him there. When he decided tq return
to New York for a yean he took pas
sage en the steamship Golden Gate for
Panama, taking some $15,000 Jn gold
with him.'
The Golden Gate started from San
Francisco loaded down with the wealth
of miners returning to their former
homes. It is supposed . that she had
between 600 and 700 passehgers and
she carried wealth to the amount of
$5,000,000. . Off the coast of Nicaragua
the steamship caught fire. AH the gold
went to the bottom of the ocean and
only forty of the passengers were
saved. * '.: < T , ;.
Chinese bandits are active on the
Mongolian border. They are hamper
ing the Russian scouts, preventing tho
purchase of supplies and attacking cat
tle purchased by the Russians. One
Russian detachment which has been
buying cattle traveled 270 miles in
eleven days.
The attitude of the North Mongolian
Princes is changing. An important
Prince whose territories touch the bor
der Is said to have forbidden Russian
merchants and reconnoitering parties
to enter his country.
General Kuropatkin has arrived here
on his special train.
Reports of the movement of the Jap
anese in the direction of Tsilsihar, 300
miles west of Harbin, have been re
vived.
The appearance of the Japanese â¢ so
far from their base is taken as an in
timation of their desire for informa
tion preliminary to an extensive flank
movement.
GUNSHU PASS. May 25.â A squadron

Andrews figured on completing his
investigation last night and was
ready to Issue a statement to . the
Grand Jury this morning.'' But the
task of gathering the , evidence .was
slower than the foreman calculated at
first, so he has asked for. afew 'days'
more grace. Consequently, the jurors
will not meet this morning. ; The.ses
sion has. been postponed till early next
week, when Andrews promises to
spring a sensation.
The foreman of the Grand Jury, has
given up the idea of implicating any
banking firms of the. city with" Smith's
shortage. After thorough investigation
Andrews came to the conclusion that
the i bankers were all absolutely- inno
cent of-any intent at wrongdoing; and
that there was no chance -for. the Grand
Jury to hold them < responsible.
"Smith committed a felony when, he
made the banks his clearing-house,"
said : Andrews last night, "but ' the
bankers were acting In 'good faith
and did not know anything about
this. Smith was bound by law :_to
make a settlement with ..Treasurer
McDougald. every , twenty-four hours,
but he rarely did tjiis. Sometimes V he
let the matter go for.* two months 'at a
time.. But | we- have no one else .to
implicate in this phase of, the case, so
it will probably be dropped." "

to any fate that might overtake her, as
she was too badly hurt to move.
Mrs. Collins is in jail and may have

night of $15, which. Mrs. Collins ac
cused Mrs. Moore of having stolen,
severed their friendship of a score of
years. â¢ The money was left on a table
in the room. Mrs. Collins claims she
went out and when she returned It was
missing. She accused aged Mrs. Moore
of having taken it, the latter says. Her
denials only Increased the rage. of Mrs.
Collins. A -fight ensued, but the older
woman was no match for the younger.
Mrs. Moore alleges that Mrs. Collins,
after pulling bandfuls of hair out of
her head and beating. her v severely,
threw, her out of the window, ignoring
her cries for mercy. > Mrs. Moore , fell

COLFAX, May 25.â One of Â£he most
shocking tragedies that has ever taken
place in Colfax was enacted last even
ing at the home of William Thomas, a
well known :and respected .citizen of
the ;town. -Between 8 and 9 o'clock
Thomas went to his wife's sleeping
room and blew off the top of his head
with a shotgun. ~At the time the ter
rible deed was committed no one else
was in the house, the wife and young
est son having; gone out to attend a
lecture. Returning' home at an early
hour from the entertainment, the son
detected the odor of powder smoke as
soon as : he entered the house. Upon
making search for the cause. he found
the lifeless body of his father lying
beside the bed, a shotgun partly under
his 'body. ';..' .
Thomas was seen on the street an
hour before he took his life and noth
ing peculiar was noted In his actions.
He had been feeling somewhat de
pressed for some time, owing to a pre
vious trouble, but until within an hour
before his death he had said nothing
that could have been interpreted as a
hint that he contemplated self-destruc
tion. About half , past 7 last evening,
while in conversation with two of his
sons near the Southern Pacific station,
he remarked: "Well, I am getting to
be an old man and, l might as well be
out of the way. '...You will' not see any
more of me after two or three hours."
But even then It was not suspected that
he meant anything serious, as he was
given to gloomy forebodings.

At the bride's table were seated the

CHICAGO, \u25a0/ May 25.â Cornelius P.
Shea,, president of the InterrÂ»*tionai
Teamsters' Union, was upheld torday
by Judge Kohlsaat of the Federal Court
in his refusal to answer .question^ be
fore Master in Chancery Sherman
which might tend to incriminate him.
Shea is now under indictment in the
Criminal Court, and Judge' Kohlsaat
declared that answers to some of the
questions put to him might prejudice
the hearing of his case.
In the same decision which excused
Shea the court ruled that Bernard Mul
ligan, president of the Express Drivers'
Union, and* John Donohue, a member of
the same union, had refused to answer
questions which could not in any way
connect them with any criminal pror
ceedings and they were therefore in
contempt of court, He sentenced both
men to Jail, but allowed them to' re
main in nominal custody in the hands
of United States Marshal Ames for five
days in order that their attorneys may
perfect a review on habeas corpus pro
ceedings before another Federal Judge.
The strike did not spread to- any
great extent to-day and there was prac
tically no disorder. A number of the
lumber firms made a few deliveries, but
did not. attempt anything like their nor
mal amount of business.
For the first time since the com
mencement o/ the strike a large num
ber of coal wagons, handled by colored
teamsters, passed through the down
town streets without police protection.
None of them were molested.
A rumor that the Mayor is to be im
peached spread to-day.. For what offense
was nbt clearly' defined. ' One story had
it that he would be brought before 'the
bar of the City. Council for his conduct
of an election/ fraud case while he was
District Attorney,, and another rumor
had it that he waa to be. made to answer
for 6ome alleged lapse of duty while in
his present position. All attempts to con
firm th*e impeachmentf rumor failed.
The "organization" leaders say they
continue to "stand pat" on the gas lease
and 'that their ranks : are solid. On : the
other hand # : Mayor Weaver announced
to-day that he had assurances that the
vote in both Council chambers when his
veto is considered would be changed ma
terially from last week's vote. . . j
The Councilmen who favor the gas
lease are having a; hard time* of it. They
are being swamped witlr protests, and
delegations of neighbors are calling on
them at their home's and places of busi
ness or holding th^m up in the streets.,.;
.It is reported to-day . that President
Roosevelt would be' asked 1 to issue a
special warning to Federal employes
to keep out of the'gas lease fight. Foes
of the "organization" 'say > that Gov
ernment employes are bringing pres
sure .to bear upon Councilmen and
that.'if it. continue, a.delegatlbn of
citizens will go to^Washirigton to see
the President. .. ;" , ,
A dramatic incident, of the day was the
great ovation given Mayor Weaver by
several thousand ' persons on his way
from the City Hall to the .Union League
for luncheon. "
This came quickly, but ' f rom an unex
pected quarterâ the State Supreme Court.
When the Mayor was ordering his old
directors out Â»of their offices his attor

when Mayor Weaver practically ejected

men appointed by Wm on Tuesday n'ght,

Other nominations were: Lieutenant

clamation); Judge of the Supreme
Court, William C. Davi^; Attorney Gen
eral, Wade Ellis; State Treasurer, W. S.
McKinnon; member of the Board of
Public Works, William Kirtley.
UaÂ« N'ovrmbcr the thundering voice of the
pecple of this State spoke for Theodore Roosa
vc\l and the Rt-publican party. Opeat as was
the popularity of our courageous President, the
body and strength or the majestic tidal wavÂ«
\u25a0was tho enduring principles of the past, of
Lincoln and McKlnley. We Republicans of
Ohio stand for Theodore Koosevelt, and we
Ftand for everything he stands for.
In Ohio to-day and in all the States there is
a growing- evil which gravely threatens to de
stroy the freedom of action which is the most
important concern of the representatives of thÂ«
people in the legislative department of the
Government. I refer to the professional lobby.
X must not be understood aa criticising those
who apr>ear before legislative committees In
proper and lfgitlmate ways to advocate or op
pose legislation, for In this way the General
Assembly is very eften materially aided In its
But the professional lobby tshould go,"
and the General Assembly of Ohio must be free
irom its interference.
Ji A, etorm of noes greeted thft chair
fnan's' question, "Are there any more
nominations?" Congressman Burton's
motion that the nomination be made by
acclamation was carried with cheers.
Governor Herrick was then presented
to the* convention. He spoke In part as
follows:
The platform eulogizes Governor Her
rick and appeals to the people of Ohio
to re-elect him and to uphold the Ohio
delegation in Congress in its eupport of
President Roosevelt,
The motion of Senator Dick for the
adoption of the platform was adopted
unanimously.
Paul Xewland of Cleveland, who pre
sented-the name of Myron T. Herrick to
the State Convention two year? ago,
again nominated his fellow townsman,
and his speech roused the delegates
more than anything that preceded it
(luring the day.
HERUICK IS REXOMIJfATED.
No nation has ever known such widespread
'prosperity as the United States has enjoyed
Â«mcc the restoration of the Republican party
to power by McKinley's election. Wage earn
ers have had more work at better prices,
farmers have held the best home markets,
making the merchants prosperous, the factories
.busy and all commerce and transportation
thrive. . With sound money, protection and.
other prudent legislation, comfort and happi
ness have come to American homes, An 4 no
etf-p has been taken that may imperil or
threaten our good tlmA. All our consumers
and producers must stand or fall together.*
.The platform then enumerates the ben
efits" "the people of Ohio have received
from, the Republican administration and
legislation; advocates generous main
tenance and administration of the pen
sion system and laws, and favors in
creased and regular appropriations -by
Congress for the improvement of rivers
and harbors.
Presdent Roosevelt's comprehensive enforce
Â»f>nt of the Republican laws against monopo
lies, combines and truEUs in restraint of trade,
;sr.> whose validity the Supreme Court of the
;Vnited States has sustained, has our hearty,
tritcouragemcnt and support. WÂ£ also tndorsa*
*very effort tor tha active enforcement of ex
isting laws to stop all unjust Oiscrimlnations
and epecial favors in the form of railway re
bates' or ' by any other device, and we favor
*uch further legislation on tnis subject with
adequate penalties as may. after full investi
gation, seem to the Republican Congress and
administration wise and conservative, yet ade
quate to prevent unfair advantage to any and
tÂ» promote and Insure the rights of all individ
uals in tliis and other localities.
. Th<Â» amendments to the constitution are as
facred as ibe original instrument. This sacred
n"Â«s of the ballot must' be maintained, and
\u25a0unjust discrimination based directly or lndlr
ractly on race, color or" previou* condition
must -not be tolerated.
Always supporting Renuine progress, evolu
tion 'n6t revolution, liberty not license, tho
Republican party continues to oppose every ln
fidious dsvlce to undermine and destroy the
stability of our civil institutions.

and National plÃtforms of X9Ol. We
stands by the principles of protection to
American labor and American industry. We
believe that Congress should bo legislate that
American ships with American sailors shall
carry American products over all seas and
through the Panama canal that the ITntted
States of America is buildine. The American
nary should be made and kept equal to every
need. We are proud of the steady progress in
Americanizing our island possessions, and of
our country's great end growing power in pro

BREACH IS WIDENING
BETWEEN EXECUTORS
ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE
MARIA KIP ORPHANAGE). WHO \ .
"S DIED YESTERDAY.
Mrs. Anna Keene, better known as
"Sister Anna," died yesterday at the
King's Daughters' Home in Oakland. The
funeral services will be held Saturday at
St. John's Church, Oakland, and the In
terment will take -place at Cypress Lawn
Cemetery. . _
The news of the death of this charita
ble woman", who. has done so much -good
work among the poor and the orphans of
this city, will be received with intense
sorrow. Though for sime time she has not
been able 7 to participate in religious af
fairs on account of illness and advanced
age, her good deeds In the past cannot
be forgotten. - ' : '\u25a0 .
Sister Anna was a native of Maryland,
and from her girlhood had been;interest
ed In charitable work. After the death of
her husband-she "became a'member of a
sisterhood and served a novitiate In St.
Louis. When she came to San Francisco
she took up the work of the Armitage
Orphanage, which was then -receiving
children of both sexes. The institution
became crowded and she decided to take
the girls and place them in an orphanage
which she started. This institution was
in poor circumstances, and the good
woman set about to raise funds and to
secure provisions for its maintenance.
Through her vigorous campaign among
the charitable she succeeded; in getting
the home established. This was the be
ginning of the Maria Kip Orphanage,
which is now one of the most success
fully conducted Episcopal institutions in
the State, its property being worth $300,
000, with a record of giving hundreds of
young girls a start in life.
The orphanage first occupied - a home
on Harrison street, near Essex, and then
moved to more spacious quarters on Fol
sotn street, to occupy later its present
splendid home on Sacramento street.
The deceased was a strong-minded and
capable woman, and through her efforts
an institution was established which Is
to-day the pride of every Episcopalian in
the diocese.

ADOPTS PLANS
FOR NEW ROAD
In response to urgent and repeated
demands from the many, patrons of the
"Twentieth Century Limited" for addi
tional time to complete important busi
ness engagements at Chicago, it has been
decided to reduce the running time one
hour, leaving Chicago at 1:20 p. m., in
stead of 12:30 p. m. as at present, arriving
at New York at 9:30 a. m., or the same
time as now. There will be no change
in the : present schedule of the west
bound train. No. 25, as its leaving time
from New York, 2:45 p. m., appears to
be eminently satisfactory. The new
change of time will go into effect Sun
day. June 18th.
The above information was contained
in a telegram from Mr. C. F. Daly, Pas
senger Traffic Manager of the. New
York Central Lines West of Buffalo, to
their representative here in San Fran
cisco. Mr. Carlton C. Crane, Pacific Coast
Agent, New York Central Lines. This
change should meet with the approval
of the many patrons of this popular
train on the coast, making, as it does,
unquestionably the. most famous and.
fastest long distance^ train in the world,
and in practically a class of its own.
"The Twentieth Century Limited"
<daily). The worJd's fastest long dis
tance train. Chicago and New York In
twenty hours â The use of "The Twenti
eth Century Limited," leaving Chicago
early in the afternoon, not only affords
& full half day for business in Chicago,
but by reason of its hour of arrival in
New York gives an entire day for busi
ness in that city.
In this train, from the buffet car
ahead to tho beautiful observation car
In the rear, it is the belief that nothing
has been left undone which can possibly
add to the safety and pleasure of the
traveler.
In addition to the barber shop ami
bath, the dally papers and illustrated
weeklies, the buffet car contains a com
plete Booklovers' Library- In the ob
servation car is an expert stenographer,

and the latest market quotations are
furnished.
The ladies' dressing-rooms are com
modious and furnished with dresser,

WOMEN'S WAYS
PROSPECTS of a tariff war between this country and Ger
many because of reciprocity treaties the Berlin Government
has just concluded, favoring the nations of Central and East
ern Europe, give interest to the surprising figures of our -trade with
that empire and to an opinion recently expressed": by the "president
of the National Manufacturers' Association of the United States
about the development of our foreign markets. D!M. : Parry, the
president of this association, says it is difficult to see how we can
improve our markets. abroad unless we can obtain some concessions
in the tariff schedule of those countries whose markets we seek.
The action of .Germany toward us is of the more importance
because our sales to that country exceed those of any other nation?
In 1903 the amount- was $222,414,000. We, buy only about' half as
much as that from her, and rank only as her third- best -customer:
The nations which she has made favoring commercial,agree
ments are Russia, Austria-Hungar}% Italy and some; of the smaller
states of Central Europe. These states-are to receive a minimum
" tariff rate on specified classes;. of imports. Against all other nations
'.he maximum tariff rate is to be enforced. Amenca willbe sHut
aut by the&eulreaties in spite of the fact that we now have" the "most
favored nation" privilege, unless some new tariff arrangements
be made which will neutralize the treaties of Germany with'neigh
boring nations. â¢; - -\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 .-. . ' ,. > .. . \u25a0 :

When it threwits weight into the scale for honest elections and

secure in the belief that they would not be led astray. Since then
every expression promoted by it has been felt by good and bad ele
ments in our politics as an assurance that a different policy from
that in control of public affairs was sure to be effected. The stated
meetings of the association have constituted a free forum, in which
men of all parties could state their attitv.de toward public affajrs
and their betterment. These meetings are looked forward to as oc
casions of encouragement to all well ; wishers of San Francisco.
There is no instance in which the combined merchants of a city,
converged upon one purpose, have been defeated. They carry into

relation between good government and commercial success. They
know that the best commercial opportunities are consistent with
good government, and it is their pride to be able~to say that they
The last meeting on Wednesday night was of peculiar and in
spiring significance. It proved that the association, having put its
hand to-ihe plow, is not looking back. It drives straight forward
to the result it has aimed to achieve. President Symnies sounded
the call to arms to save the city from debauch, and put local pa
triotism on a pedestal alongside of that patriotism which is love of
country. The address of Governor Pardee which followed was a
masterly arraignment of grafters and corruptionists, and left the
public in no doubt of his sympathy with the movement for reform,
to which it gave a distinctly greater headway. The Governor never
minces matters, but says what he believes in tone so certain and
decisive that good men stand straighter and go forward with more
confidence, and bad men fall back and give them the right of way.
The Governor classed the crimes against the people all to
gether, declaring: "It is a crime, abhorred of all men, to betray
one's country in time of war. It is a crime to betray one's public
trust in time of peace. It is a crime to corrupt the ballot-box, either
at a general or primary election. If death be a proper punishment
for him who betrays us in time of war, why should not the ""same
punishment be meted out to- him who, committing an equally great
if hot a greater crime, sneakingly strikes us in the back and deals
a coward's blow at all we hold most dear while, exercising the "^reat
privilege of an American citizen, he corrupts the very fountain
head whence flow our boasted guarantees of 'life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness?'" '
That has the true ring. No wonder it inspired the audience to
an expression of approbation which took up the brave note -M
defiance and sent it ringing onward. The Governor's closing sen
tence was a distinct and emphatic. indorsement and encouragement
of the work of the association. He said: "Gentlemen of the Mer
chants' Association, you are to be: congratulated for the stand you
have taken in the interest of pure politics and honest government.
May your efforts continue to meet, with success until every traitor
ous knave who seeks to corrupt our elections fills a felon's celU'i
The Governor was followed by Senator Belshaw,. who was
chairman of the committee that brought the four, boodling Senators
to the bar of the Senate for expulsion. He strongly enforced the
need of organization and of united effort of all decent men at the
primary polls, to the end that there may be assembled a representa
tive and deliberative, convention responsible for its acts to the ele
ments of local decency and local, patriotism. Major Weinstock fol
lowed in the same line, advising such sacrifice of time and ease as
shall be necessary to "show The world that you have civic pride
and patriotism that rise above the love of gain ; that you have con
victions and the courage to live up to. them ; that you have high
ideals and strive to attain them ; that you. are alive to the duties
of American citizenship and do not shirk them."
Mr. James H. Barry continued -the, inspiring expressions of
high purpose, by advising organization broad enough to command^
the sympathy and support of all the people who think alike in re
spect to good government. He called attention to the smallper
centage^of voters who took part in the last primary, the absentees;
making it possible for one man to control both conventions, anil
with one exception to betray the nominees of both. He spoke for
scores of others in saying: "I have scant respect for the man who
is ever prating of good government, but never does anything to
bring it about." - *
Rev. Mr. Rader, who is a force to be reckoned with in. our muni
cipal life, added to the strength of all that had been said for civic
righteousness, and all who, were present felt that the first gun had
been fired in a campaign that is to be fought to a finish,; and that
the finish will not scotch but kill the serpent of municipal graft,
theft and dishonesty. * * . f
THERE 1 is nothing necessarily bad or offensive in being a poli
tician. If the term means a man who takes an intelligent in
terest in politics, and is willing, if called, to serve his fellow
citizens in office,there is nothing offensive in it. But when a man
adopts politics as a vocation, having no other visible means of sub
sistence, the case is different. Unfortunately it has come -to. pass
that the people apply the term almost exclusively *> the latter class
of politicians, greatly to the detriment and detraction of the public
spirited man who is in politics for the health and benefit of the
community. - ; . ...
The right conception of a politician, and of the citizen's duty
in politics, was splendidly expressed by many speakers at the ban
quet of the Merchants' Association. There has been â¢no doubt of
the position of that representative organization. Its history is a
record of honorable achievement in every line to which it has de
voted its energies. It has come to be properly regarded as the
champion of a clean city, physically and morally. Its increasing
strength and growing sense of power to be well used have caused
it to be looked upon as the balance wheel of the municipality,
steadying the public mind and effort by a right and reasonable
guidance. ~"*" .

that for no'appareht' cause the engines
refused to back. ;He then opened the

into the low pressure cylinder, and
the engine failed to move. He then put

"I consider this one of the greatest of
benefactions In the world, that of assist

the assistance and co-qperattaa of you

"Since, this great work was started."
said Miss Booth last night, "the progress
has been remarkable throughout the
world. People little realize the magni
tude this undertaking has beexme, but
when we eton to think what an army of
men and women are giving up the free
dom of life in Its pursuit an idea of Its ui
mension can be obtained. Starting from a
missionary society with no firm footing,
the Salvation Army has growo into pro
jvortions that make it powerful as an in
ternational order. England and the Con
tinent are also aided in the work of car
ing for the spiritually needful. The com
mand of this great work is attributed to
my father and it was by him that I waa
made a disciple ef its teachings.
"Special plans are now under way for
the extension of the work to every part
of the globe, but in the meantime no
cessation of the present work will be tol
erated. It Is ojjr great aim to help the
downtrodden by appealing to hiÂ« man
hood as we find him and by ministering
to his wants even as Christ would have
done were he on earth as we. I have
been raised in the teachings of this faith.

zation in the UnJted States makes her
proud of her new command.
Last night's reception at the Alhambra
â¢was a public demonstration of the syra
rathy for the Salvation cause. Rev F
W. CUunpett, Trinity Episcopal Church!
made brief introductory remarks on the
history of the society and the work ac
complished since It was founded.
Miss Booth came forward, but the open
ing of her talk was stayed for a time by
the deafening applause that greeted her
advent. She mado several attempts to
address the audience, and each was met
by more hearty cheering. This attitude
of the auditors greatly encouraged tae
commander, who was fatigued from over
work, to handle her subject w!th xonch
ease.
California's welcome to Miss E. Booth,
Commander of the Salvation Army in
the United States, at the Alhambra last
right, was successful, so successful that
the crowds of admirers of this woman.
*ho has done so much for the poor in
soul and spirit, could not all be admitted
to the hall. When she made her ap
pearance before the vast audience, dress
ed In the simple regulation red and blue
regalia of the order, the enthusiastic ap
}>lauÂ£e drowned the voice, of the speaker
who introduced her. Sympathy for he:
cause and admiration for the work she
has done made the San Francisco wel
come one which Miss Booth herself called
"generous."
Commander Miss Booth" lectured on
"Under Two Flags," meaning one of
Christ and the other of the United States,
under which she works. She spoke of the
\u25a0work as a means of rairing the criminal
from the depths of depravity to a condi
tion of respect for the laws of God and
country, and the assistance piven the
needy with ever increasing number. Peo
ple who have seen these hard working
army men and women tolling through
city slums and rescuing the unfortunate
downcast on the street heard the Com
mander of this bar.d of workers in the
United State* last night. \u0084;

FHOM, SAME BOX.
\\ hrrr the Foods Come From. ,'.
"Look here, waiter, honest now, dÂ«n't
you <Jip every cne of these . . naked
br-akfaht foods out of the same box?"
'"Well yes, boss, we duz. all \u25a0'cept Grape-
Nuts, 'cause that don't look like the
others and. people know "zactly" what
Urape-N'uts looks like. But there's
'bout a dozen different ones named on
the bill of tare and. they are all thin
rolled flakes, co It don't make any dif-
ference which one a man calls for, we
Just take out the order from one box."
This talk led to an investigation.
Doxeas of factories sprung: ud about
three years ago, making various kinds
of breakfast foods, seeking: to take the
business of the original prepared break-
fast food â Grape-Nuts. These concerns
after a precarious existence nearly all
failed, leaving- thousands of boxes of
their toods in mills and warehouses.
Thc-ee were in several- instances bought
up for a song: by speculators and sold
out to grocers and hotels for little or
nothing". The process of working: off
this old stock,, has been slow. One win
see the names on menus of flaked foods
that went out of business a year and a
half or two years ago. In a few cases
where the' abandoned factories have
been bought up there is an effort to
resuscitate the, defunct, and by copying-
the style of advertising" of Grape-Nuts,
seek to Influence people to purchase.
But the public has f>een educated to the
fact that all these thin flaked foods are
simply soaked wheat or oats rolled thin
and dried out and packed. They are not
prepared like Grape-Nuts. In which the
thorough baking: and other operations
which turn the starch part of the wheat
and barley into sug-ar, occupy many
hours and result In a food so digestible
that small infants thrive pn it, while
It also contains the selected elements of
Phosphate of Potash and Albumen that
unite In the body to produce the soft
gray substance in brain and nerve cen-
ters. There's a reason for Grape-Nuts,
and there have been many imitations/ a
few of the article lteelf, but many more
of the kind and character, of the v ad-
vertising". Imitators are always coun-
terfeit er? and their printed . and writ-
ten statements cannot be/expected to be
different th,ah their goods.

PORTLAND, May 25â Mitchell, the
giant first baseman, slapped at the
ball with his bat to-day out on Mult
nomah field. He did not mean to do
it, but the ball went so far that he
made the circuit and brought home the
man who gave the home team tue best
of a 3 to 2 contest with the Commuters
This was in the eighth inning at a
time when the score was a tie, Tlogan
was -wild and gave all the assistance
possible to the enemy. Oakland hit
Jones often enough to have won two
or three games, but the Portland
twiner was steady and effective at
critical pqlnts in the game. The
score:
Portland â - .'S*-. Oaklandâ

Max Rosenf eld, captain of the Olympic
Clvb t appeared before-, the. Supervisors'
Police Committee yesterday and stated
that the Hawthorne Club. -which has
been granted an amateur boxing permit
for the 31st inst.,, has joined the Pacific
Athletic Association, which -will super
vise the contests to be held by the club.
New names appear in the lists and many
of the old favorites must* either join the
professionals or retire.. The men matched
by the Hawthorne, Club are: .
Corbett is - having his usual siege of
weight-reducing at his Ocean Beach quar
ters. Dave Barry has been added to the
training s.taff and will help get : off the
troublesome flesh. Corbett wants to be
at his best, as the winner has been prom
ised a match in July With either Abe At
tell or Jabez White.
Eddie tipped the weighing beam yes
terday at 134 pounds, four pounds above
the n:ark at which he and Corbett '\u25a0 have
agreed to weigh in at 6 p.m. on the day
of the battle. While Hanlon is not any
larger now than when he last fought
here, his frame is set and seasoned and
his muscles fine and firm. Eddie, in com
pany with Irwln, tramped eight miles
yesterday mcrning, returning to head-,
quarters on a trot. In the afternoon he

Knibbs was captain and fullback of the
Dartmouth team for two years,* during
which time Dartmouth' was not scored
against. It also defeated \ Harvard. . Last
year Knibbs coached Dartmouth and was
successful, in producing results// He
weighs 165 Pounds 'and' is 5 feet 10 inches
in height. He is. expected , to arrive. Jn !
Berkeley early In August/ Assistance will
be provided for: him probably f rom v the
ranks^ of California : graduates .who have
been prominent . in ' football.' '-.r. r ; . ;
In selecting Knibbs the universit ha.3
departed from traditions, which decreed
that a professional coach should come
from one of . the ' big ' universities like
Princeton, Yale or Harvard. It is ex
pected Knibbs will inaugurate a . radically
different style jof play : and thrft the old
Princeton game will, be relegated to the
rear, while new methods are put in oper
ation. ,
A football Moses who 'r is expected to,
â¢ lead the University of California -'.eleven
into the land where! victories over Stan
ford, are common occurrences, has been
found by Manager Ezra Decoto. He an
nounced yesterday that a new- coach has
been chosen in the person of J. W. Knibbs
Jr. of Dartmouth -College.. No details of
the .agreement between Knibbs and. the
university authorities here regarding sal
ary and other matters are given out by
Decpto. .
The engagement of the. new coach is
due in large part to the tour of the East
recently made |by J. :A; â¢ Force .'captain
of the varsity eleven, who visited all of
the large Eastern universities | and col
leges in a search for a coach to replace
Jame3 Hopper, director of California's
fortunes on the gridiron last year. Force
talked, with Yale, ; Harvard, Princeton,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Wiscon
sin, Minnesota and other college men
before deciding that' William J. Knibbs
was.toest fitted,: among the coaches avail
able, to handle the California team this
year.

: With a rhythmic stride that commanded

to his most feared competitors, he made
his own pace from flag fall to finish and
never for \u25a0 a moment did he cause hi 3
friends trepidation. .Only = once did his
clever-jockey, .Tommy Burns, shake him

the real McCoy. He works fast and did
well with the exception of calling a few

The home talent stalled the Siwashes
and the Siwashes stalled the home talent
at Recreation Park yesterday till the last
round of the trouble. Then the visitors
failed as stallers, so the game broke up.
Waldron passed safely through the home
gate after Hildebrand slapped out his
third hit for the game to a remote cor
ner of the center garden. Scoreâ San
Francisco 1, Seattle 0.
Each inning- of the game was about a
repetition of the one which preceded it.
The pitchers, Whalen and Shields, were
the big chiefs of the occasion, and every
thing they did was admired and applaud
ed. They seemed to grow better as* the
game progressed, and they might have
bÂ«en going yet had not the Seals sum
moned up enough ginger to pull the game
cut in the last half of the last period.
Waldron .ed off with a bunt down the
third base line. Shields grabbed the ball
end fell down. He heaved it out to the
bleachers, letting Walley, arrive at aec
ond. Spencer followed with another, and
this time Shields tossed to third too late
to head off Waldron. Spencer lost no
time in stealing, and after Wheeler had
flyed to right Hildebrand clouted one to
the center field fence, and the fans said
"good-night."
Mohler was out out of commission by
bumping into McHale in the third inning.
A doctor examined the injured Kid j and
announced that the fans need not expect
to see him perform for another month.
WhUe running to first in the ninth Lefty
Houtz wrenched his ankle and he. too,
will be in the hospital class for a while.
Thus two good ball players go out in one
Rood game.

late Wednesday night, landed Her pas*
scngers yesterday morning at 11 o'clock.
As the tide was low she came to anchor
off^ the Mail dock and her passengers
were brought to the wharf by the tug
Sea:R6vor.' No provision whatever was
made to receive them on the dock â no
gangplank was put out to the tug to as
sist them to the shoreâ but they were al
lowed to scramble up to the dock as best
they could. Men. women and ilttle chil
dren all clambered up pell-mell, and with
the assistance of their felow. passengers
landed wherever a helping hand was out
stretched. When the Mongojladid come
alongside the dock the passengers that
were left on board were compelled to go
on Ehore down a ladder at an Incline of
Elxty degrees. The air about the dock
was not blue, but the remarks handed
out by the passengers were not what
might be called "compliments'.* to the
Pacific Mall Steamship Company.
Among the passengers on the liner
was Captain John BI Briggs, who was
commander of the cruiser Baltimore
when she ran ashore on October. 31, 1904,

matters" concerning naval construction
and the manufacture of arms. They ex
pect to remain in England some time
and are all very anxious to visit Wool
xrtch arsenal. Accompanying them is
Count Kinjiro Hirosawa.
Pierre iorillard Jr., who. Is making ; a
<cur of the world., was also. on the list.
He Is a gfandson of the famous "tobacco
manufacturer and horse owner of the
same name. , , , .

court which tried Captain Briggs, was a

Ananl Zimmerman, who - has been sup
plying the Russian Government with
meats for the last six years, was a pas
senger.. He Is reported to have accumu
lated -cn i -enormous fortune in this busi
ness. He was In Port Arthur during the
siege. He is accompanied by a party of
eight, all members of his family. They
are makinjr a tour of the world.

A good {time for . a little time has
cost Miles T. --. Balrd,' ( son of Mrs. Veron
ica Baird. his onje^fourth Interest in
â¢1520 â¢ acres, of i land '\u25a0_ in. Contra Costa
County, valued at $100 an acre, in ad
dition to an attorney's fee of $1000. for
which a Jury -In "Judge 'Graham's 'court
gave Judgment â¢ against him - yesterday.
Attorneys /Garoutte arid: Goodwin se
cured the verdict' for servlces'rendered
young Baird.
i Last" August young \u25a0 Baird, ; accord! ng
to his own admission, went on a' spree,
with the result that ; his business facul
ties vwere largely .damaged.. While In
this \u25a0\u25a0condition he gave" to , Elmer West
lake'an\opfion, on his- interest in tho
Contra Costa r lands, the ; price beingr
fixed in ;theoption'at"slo; theoption'at"$10 an acre. When
Baird came; outÂ»of his alcoholic stupor
he realized that he had made a bad bar
gain and employed | Garoutte and Good
win %to brine ; suit ; to set', aside* the op-.
tion.~^ Shortly .'after the suit ,was : filed
young; Baird again: Invaded the.tender
loin': and between assaults on the cock
tail : . citadels.be _ ; again < met Westlake.
This*: time -he sold the Contra; Costa
properties outright > to .Westlake at ; a
price. said: to be -greatly, less. than their
value. This,' of course, .ended the suit
to i set : aside ' the - original option, but
Garoutte" and Goodwin demanded '; a fee
of $1000. 'Baird: refused to pay, it, with
.th^ result -that suit" was -brought, the
attorrfeys .'assigning: their:: claim to
George \u25a0 Golder," a { grocer at 1416 How
ard street. ; -Golder,* joined 'the' suit for
the ;" fee ; with several \ claims onipromis

and â¢; Balrd r admitted judgment on all

Heights, but' as the intervening soil is
extremely absorbent he; could,", if so in

His malicious intent was demonstrated
by the fact that he conveyed the hose
across; the' lot and swished the "stream
against" tue wall of her. house, thereby
underlining the foundation and :; thus
imperiling, the lives of i the 'occupants.
