MARTIN KELLY ENTANGLES HIMSELF IN MESHES OF NET
IN WHICH THE FOUR BOODLING SENATORS WERE CAUGHT
K/JARTIN KELLY, the ex-political boss of San Francisco, may be indicted for perjury because of his alleged connection with the bribery scandal in Sacra
mento. Gavin McNab, who planned the trap in which Senators French, Emmons, Wright and Bunkers were caught, is responsible for Kelly's con
nection with the case. According to McNab, Kelly came to him after the exposure of the Sacramento plot and told him that Senator French had given him a bank
note that answered the description of one passed to French by Agent Jordan. McNab sent Kelly to Senator Belshaw, chairman of the Bribery Investigating Com
mittee. Kelly repeated his story, and, according to Belshaw, promised to appear before the committee with the marked note. Kelly appeared, it is said, but
without the note, excusing his failure to keep his promise by saying he had made a mistake.

Special Diapatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 17.â Armed, they
declare, with full concessions, "Joe"
t'liman and "Maxey" Blumenthal,
both well known in the sporting
vcrld, have left this city lor Los An
geles to complete their plans for the
#>st&b!ishmer.t of an American Monte
Carol on Santa C<Â±talina Island.
In this "year round" resort, they
have told their friends, they intend to
lay out parks and build casinos, the
like of which have never been seen In
the Western hemisphere. There, un
troubled by laws of any kind, they
â¢ay, they will afford every person that
cares to an opportunity to play against
any frame of chance, ancient or mod
for any sum that may be named.
Before leaving they said that every
thing: warn m weli arranged that al
most their first la.sk would be to take
architects
and engineers, who would select for
them a site large enough to answer
their purpose. These chosen, archi
builders and gardeners will be
employed to carry out the plans.
Both Blumenthal and Ullman are
known as daring bettors, not alone on
race tracks, but in various <lubs with
which both have been connected.
Vllman was known for several seasons
M ihe bookmaker willing to accept the
=t waÂ«rers offered at a track. Re
of 125,000 bets made by John W.
and "Pittsburg Phil" were free
-culated two years ago at Sara
toga. Last year a published account
R&ld there had been only a slight de
crease In the amounts. That the two
men have obtained a foothold on

â porting men in this city. '

CHICAGO. Feb. 17.â Rumors of the
proposed retirement of John W. Gates
from the "pit" if he can secure the
title of "Wheat King" and a falling
off in the price of the cereal from
$1 21%, yesterday's closing, to figures
ruling between (1 18% and $1 19%, were
features to-day on the Board of Trade.
, It was said the big operator intend
ed that the present deal should be the
crowning triumph of his speculative
career and that, with it once conclud
ed, he would drop markets Â«Vnd stocks
and devote himself to his automobile.
For this reason he is said to be ma
neuvering carefully and wishes to
steady the market now, because a pre
mature advance would make possible
large importations from Argentina and
enable the "shorts" to recuperate.
More than 3.000,000 bushels of Argen

VICTIM OF A YOUTHFUL. KUSSIAN TERRORIST. WOMAN WIDOWED BT THE
ASSASSINATION, ANOTHER SAID TO BE CONDEMNED TO DEATH BY REV
OLUTIONISTS. AND THE SCENE OF THE MOSCOW TRAGEDY.
Death Sentence Passed by Terror
ists Is Horribly Executed.
MOSCOW, Feb. 18.â Within the walls
bf the far-famed Kremlin Palace and
almost underneath the historical tower
from which Ivan the Terrible watched
the heads of his enemies falling be
neath the ax of the famous Red
Square, and within a stone's throw of
the great bell of Moscow, Grand Duke
Sergius, uncle and brother-in-law of
Emperor Nicholas and the chief of the
reactionaries, met a terrible death
shortly before 3 o'clock yesterday aft
ernoon. The deed was committed by a
single terrorist, who threw beneath the
carriage of the Grand Duke a bomb
charged with the same high power ex
plosive which wrought Minister yon
Plehwe's death. The missile was packed
with nails and fragments of iron, and
its explosion tore the imperial victim's
body to ghastly fragments, which
strewed the snow for yards around.
Every window in the great, lofty fa
cade of the Palace of Justice w. s
shattered and bits of iron were imbed
ded deeply in the walls of the arsenal,
a hundred yards away.
The assassin belongs to the noted
"fighting group" trf the Socialist revol

Duke Sergius. The Grand Duke knew

EX-POLITICAL BOSS
MAY BE INDICTED
ON PERJURY CHARGE
Fails to Produce Bill It Is Said
He Declared French Gave
Him After Exposure.
Backs Down on the Stand
Special Dispatch to The (ill.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 17.â The fat.
red features of Martin Kelly have been
added to the gallery of accused bood
lers, Emmons, French, Wright and
Bunkers. The ex-political boss* of San
Francisco has been caught in a trap
laid by himself and it is quite probable
that to-morrow Martin will be called
upon to introduce to the authorities
the bondsmen that will insure his ap
pearance on a charge of perjury now
in course of preparation by District At
torney Seymour.
Martin Kelly's tangle v. ith the bood
lers cape to light unexpectedly this j
afternoon when he emerged from an
executive meeting of the special inves
tigating committee that has been con- !
sidering the charges against the ac- 1
f used Senators.
Standing against Kelly is the testi- |
tnony of Senator Belshaw, chairman of i
the investigating committee, and '
Gavip McNah, who say that Kelly told
th^m without solicitation that he had
been handed one of the marked bills
so often referred to in the bribery in
vestigation by Senator French.
"A week ago last Saturday." McNab
testified, "Martin Kelly called at my
office and asked me what his position j
would be if he should withhold from i
the investigating committee one of the I
bills that had been handed him by Sen- >
ator French on the evening of the day
the bribery charges were filed in the
Senate by William Corbin. I ques
tioned him at length and he tfcld me
French had handed him a $50 bill bear
ing the number of one in the published
iist of the notes that had been used j
to trap the accused Senators. The bill,
he said, had been sent by him from j
Sacramento to San Francisco, ad- j
dressed to his own home, and that he i
still had it in his possession. It was
the bill referred to as the Santa Bar
bara bank note.
CALLS OX BELSHAW.
"I did not go much further in my
examination of Mr. Kelly, but decided
to place the matter immediately in the
hands of the investigating committee.
Last Monday evening I met Kelly in
the Capitol Hotel in this city. I again
questioned him and asked him if he
would not make the statement he had
made to me to a member of the com
mittee. He then went to room 62 of
the Capitol Hotel, where Senator Bel
shaw was waiting, and I understand
told Senator Belshaw the facts sub
stantially the same as he outlined
them to me."
Senator Belshaw took the stand and
corroborated McNab in every detail.
"Last Monday evening, the loth
inst.," Belshaw testified. "Martin Kel
ly came before me in room 62 of the
Capitol Hotel and told me that he had
the Santa Barbara bank note referred
to as among those used to trap the
accused Senators. He said it had been
handed to him by Senator French on
the night of the exposure of this affair
in the Senate. After much talk I
wrung from him a definite promise
that he would appear before the com
mittee and bring the note. At that
time he made no intimation that there
could be a mistake about the proposi
tion; he was sure he had one of the
notes used in the entrapment of the
accused SenaU â  l and to free himself
from any responsibility he said he
would produce the same.
"But yesterday, Thursday, he called
upon me at my office in San Fran
cisco and told me that he had made a
mistake; that he had examined the
note that had been .handed to him by
French and that it was not the Santa
Barbara bank note but a United States
gold note and was not one of those
mentioned as having been passed to
the accused Senat6rs. I told him that
some mysterious influence was chang
ing his views of the facts; that he had
told me positively that the note in his
possession was one of those used to
trap the accused Senators and that he
had given me the definite promise that
he would produce the same before the
committee.
KELLY MAKES DENIAL.
"He denied that he had told me so
and said that he had stated that he
had been given a bill by Senator j
French; that he had not examined it â 
and did not know whether it was one
of the bills used in the entrapment, but j
knowing its denomination he had sus
pected that it- might be and had decid
ed to unbosom himself, and that if
after examining the note he found that j
it was one of those being sought by the
prosecution he would give it up to free
himself of any suspicion. These are
not the facts, however. He told me
positively that he had one of the much
sought bills and promised equally posi
tively that he would produce it."
In a strenno-^ endeavor to swear
himself out rj this predicament Martin
Kelly worked harder than he has for
years. Members of the committee affirm
that he drank a whole pitches of water,
perspired as he never did before and
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
. invented a tale that for even Martin
contained dreams beyond compare.
"This is the bill." said Kelly, when
called to the stand, "that was handed
to me by Senator French." and he
, handed out United States gold note No.
0251^05, which is not among the list
of those used to entrap the accused
i Senators. "I will tell you all about this.
Gavin McNab has owed me a printing
bill of $305 for a long time. He repudi
ated it and told â "Â» he would not pay
it, but when he got Into that last fight
with the 'Horses and Carts' in San
Francisco he needed my help. He sent
for me and told me that if I would help
j him out. he would pay me 160 on that
printing bill. He paid me the $50 and I
did help him out.
| "A week ago last Saturday he tel
| ephoned to me and told me that if I
would come to his office he would pay
! me $25 rr.4sÂ»e on account of that print
i ing bill, I went to his office, he paid
' me the $25. and then I told him about
: the b I have, submitted for your la-
{ spectlon, :t6iSay. ' I*" told him that . on
| the evening of the day of the exposure
j of the bribery scandal Senator French
! had handed me a 150 bill in part pay
| mem of an old account. We have had
, business dealings together and he
i owed me this money. I did not look
' at the bill, and a short time after I
I received I placed It in an envelope
| and mailed it to myself, addressing it
to my home in San Francisco.
FINDS HIS MISTAKE.
"I had not examined it when I
called upon Mr. McNab. and all I told
â¢him was that I had received a $50
bill from French: that it was my Im-
I pression that it was one that had been
passed to the accused Senators to en
trap them and also that my' impres
sion was that it was the Santa Bar
bara banknote that had been men
tioned as among these passed out I
did not examine the bill until yester
day, when I immediately called upon
Senator Belshaw at his office In San
Francisco and told him that I had
been mistaken in my belief that I had
one of the bills said to have been
passed to the accused Senators; that
I I had examined the bill and found
it to be a United States gold note and
not the Santa Barbara note I believed
it to be.
"After I first told McXab about the
bill I had received from French he
tried to lay a trap to get me to talk
before a third party and finally he
succeeded in getting me to go before
Senator Belshaw and make a state
ment. It is not true that I told either
Senator Belshaw ,or Mr. McNab that
I had one of the bills they were
searching for; all I told them was
that I, had a 150 bill that had been
paid me by French, and that it might
be one of the bills they were looking
for."
Asked how he got the impression
that the bill that had been handed
him by French might be one of the
bills the prosecution -wanted, Kelly
said:
"When I got home to San Francisco
after mailing the bill I examined sev
eral letters I found waiting for me and
then I opened the one containing the*
bill. I asked my daughter to take It
upstairs and compare it with the list
of the bills said to have been given the
accused Senators. The list was printed
In one of the papers. Subsequently
she left the bill on my desk and a
bit of paper, on which was written
the number of one of the bills in the
i'st, and from this I got the impres
sion that that was the number of the
bill I had given her to examine. But
it was not, as I afterward found.
' "The number she had written was
the one on the list opposite the end of
a mark I had drawn on the paper
showing her where the list wad. I guess
that the mark called her attention to
the number Â» and she unconsciously
copied it on the slip when looking over
the list. This gave me the Impression
that the bill I had was one of those
the prosecution was searching for and
the number my daughter copied down
was that of the Santa Barbara note.
This is how I got that impression.'*
STICKS TO TESTIMONY.
No amount of cross-examination
: would force the admission from X
j that in fact the note he had **aa
i Santa Barbara note or that in fact h*
I had told either McNab or Senator

ASSASSINATION OF SERGIUS IS

TRAGEDY MAY

FOR REFORM
Era Victim Said to Have
Been Won Over to New
Policy.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. IS.â The
assassination of Grand Duke Sergius
undoubtedly was the work of the fight
ing organization of the Socialistic rev
olutionary party, which condemned
and executed Count Bobrikoff, Gov
ernor General of Finland, and Sipi-,
guine and yon Plehwe, Ministers of.
the Interior. It is regarded as a di- ]
lect challenge from the terrorists to,
the autocracy, and a revival of the f a- j
nious duel between the Nihilists and
the Government of twenty-five years |
ago.
Opinions differ as to the political ef
fect of the tragedy, some inclining to
the view that the killing of a member
of the imperial family may cause
Nicholas II to revive a period of re
action, but this is not generally shared.
The murder of Grand Duke Scrgius

Liberalism were again in the suprem

zemsky tabor was assured is con

etrongly as do the Liberals and the (
Conservatives.
According to a high authority the
decision had been already taken offi
cially to i>roclaim the zemsky zabor on
January 22. Souverin. editor of the

The news of the tragic death of his
uncle was brought to the Emperor
v hile he was giving an . audience to
General Grippenberg, and gave him a
great shock. By the Emperor's direc
t:on the member* of the imperial fam
ily who were at Tsarskoe-Selo. in con
nection â¢th the visit of Prince Fred
erick Leopold of Prussia, were imme
diately summoned to the chapel, where
a requiem was held. A state requiem
et which members of the diplomatic
corps will be present is announced for
to-day.
The funeral arrangements have not
yet been made, but, in accordance with
tradition, the funeral probably will be
on an imposing scale.
The story if going the rounds that
Grand Duke Sergius himself, at the
last moment, finding the tide against j
him. was won over to the plan of sum
moning the zemsky zabor and that he
sent c messenger to Emperor Nicholas,
outlining his views as to the composi
tion of the body. It is added that the
messenger arrived at almost the same
time that the bomb was thrown i
Moscow. According to Sergius' plan,
it was proposed that each province
should have six representatives in the
convention, two each of nobles, mer
chants and peasants.

OF HIS DEED
Murderer Boasts When Ar

to a Prison.
< onUniK'U From Page 1. Column 5.
He was the recipient of repeated warn
ings, and elaborate precautions were
taken to insure his safety; but all the
resources of the gendarmerie, secret
police and soldiers proved unavailing
against an attempt almort exactly
duplicating the procedure that caused
the death of Minister of the Interior
yon Plehwe last July.
GRAND DUCHESS OVERCOME.
It was the irony of fate that Sergius,
after taking refuge in his country villa
during the strike troubles of a month
â¢<H'< and later seeking even more se
< i re shelter in the palace within the
Kremlin walls, should be killed while
proceeding to the Governor General's
c beyond the walls, which he
had abandoned to enable the police to
better protect him.
Grand Duchess Elizabeth, who has
bt en engaged daily in the task of pre
paring comforts for the sick and
wounded Russian soldiers in Bfan
( huria, was about to drive to the pal
flcf to join her husband. When she
h< ard what had befallen the Grand
Duke she was driven in haste to the
â¢ of the tragedy and knelt, hal
oid coatless, on the blood-stained
*row and murmured prayers for the
re of the soul of her slain con
.-irt.
The scene of the crime was the great
open triangle within the Kremlin,
In.unded by the arsenal treasury and
th* Court of Justice, in one angle of
whk-h is the Nicholas or little palace,
â  here the Grand Duke dwelt. At the
opposite corner is the Nikolsky gate,
the exit to the town beyond the ram
parts.
ASSASSIN 11 URLS BOMB.
A fÂ«w minutes before the bell of
the gate sounded the hour of 3 the
equipage of the Grand Duke emerged
from the gates of the palace and pro
o.eded, followed by sleighs containing
m eret police. It swept at a smart
pace toward the gate, passing the
Choudoff Cloister, Ivan's Tower, the
great Czar Bell and long rows of can
non captured from Napoleon in the
winter retreat of 1812. En a moment
the carriage was In front of the Court
of Justice, where the walls w>( the
triangle approach, forming a narftow
entrance to the Nikolsky gate.
There a man clad in workman's at
tire stepped forward from the sidewalk
and threw a bomb which he had con
cealed beneath his coat. A terrible ex
plosion followed and a hail of iron
pelted the grim stone walls of the ar
wnal of the Court of Justice. A thick
< loud of smoke, snow, dust and debris
arose. When it had cleared a ghastly
sight was presented.
On the 6now lay fragments of the
body of Grand Duke Sergius, mingled
with the wreck of the carriage. The
Grand Duke's head had been torn from
his body and reduced to a shapeless
pulp, and the trunk and limbs were
frightfuly mangled. A finger bearing
a rich seal ring was found lying several
yards away. The crimson tint and the
smell of blood were everywhere. Only
a few fragments of clothing indicated
that the body had been clothed. The
coachman lay moaning with pain be
side a deep hole in the pavement. The
hnrsf-s, dragging the front wheels of
the carriage, had dashed off. maddened
by pain, to sink dying before they
reached the gate.
MURDERER IS CAPTURED.
The sound of the explosion was heard
throughout the city, and even beyond
the river. A crowd began to assemble
and to handle grim evidenc.es of the
tragedy, while they discussed the af
fair in awe-stricken voices.
Officials rapidly gathered, but before
anything could be done toward collect- 1
ing the scattered fragments of the body
Grand Duchess Elizabeth drove up in
an open carriage. She had dropped
her work at the headquarters of the
Red Cross and sped to the scene of the
crime without waiting to don her outer
wraps. She broke down at the sight,
and dropped to her knees, sobbing.
After a few minutes she was led away.
Then a stretcher was brought and,
covered with a plain soldier's cloak,
the remains of Sergius were borne to
the Choudoff Cloister, where officers
and members of the Grand Duke's suite
had assembled.
The assassin was thrown to the
ground and stunned by the force of the
explosion, but he immediately arose
and ran toward the gate, attempting
to escape. His haste and the blood
streaming from his face where he had
been wounded by fragments of the
bomb attracted the attention of a ser
geant of police, who seized him before
he could draw a revolver.
The man did not deny his crime, but,
on the contrary, gloried in its success.
He expressed his satisfaction that he
had been able to kill the Grand Duke
without involving the Duchess. He
avowr) hi? membership to the Socialist
revolutionary organization, but refused
tn give his name and at the jail hia
paper* were found to be forged.
CROWDS ATTACK STUDENTS.
The revolver with which the assassin
was armed was an automatic magazine
pistol of the same type as the weapon
employed by Hyhenthal, the assassin
Â«>f Solnincn, Procurator General of Fin
land. The assassin's wounds are not
â ertotta.
The Grand Duke's coachman, who
wm severely injured, was removed to a
hospital. Late last night he waa still
living.
All places of amusement have been
closed.
Immense crowds gathered near the
Kremlin, where some factions began
to attack the students and the situa
tion began to look threatening, but so
far the police measures to preserve
order have proved effective and last
night the city waÂ« quiet.

it mutt be admitted that Sergius was per
fectly consistent and that his career wa.
rounded and complete. Orthodoxy and au
tocracy were inscribed on his banner from
the first, and he fought hard for them, in his
OWa way. to the bitter end. His manner,
though suggestive of hauteur, was extremely
amiable; but one could well conceive him,
under other conditions, capable ot those un
justifiable follies of coarseness, criticism and.
cruelty which have been associated with his
name and were proximat* causes of his death.
His influence over the Emperor emanated
partly frost his own seif-confldenee. dogmatic

his wife.

that the revolutionist groups have received a
great accession of strength from Liberals,
who hitherto have favored a constitutional
propaganda; that they have come into pos
seasioa of large funds and are determined to
adopt extreme measures, which they believe
will not be severely condemned by public
opinion. The authorities are aware of these
preparations and are making many arrests
ben, in Moscow and in Odessa, besides taking
other measures of precaution.
According to a dfspatch from St. Pe
tersburg to a news agency here, the
assassins of Grand Duke Sergius left
that city for Moscow while the atten
tion of the authorities was riveted by
reports of a recrudescence of the strike.
own, but adopted Maria and Dimltri,
the young: son and daughter of Ser
gius' yuunper brother, the Grand:
Duke Paul, who incurred the Czar's :
displeasure by contracting a mor- j
ganatic marriage.
The domestic relations between Ser- j
gius and his wife are said to have been ,
anything but pleasant. In fact, his j
treatment of his wife, it is reported, 'â 
called forth remonstrances from his '
brother. Czar Alexander 111.
Sergius was a prominent and influ
ential member of the council of the
empire; also lieutenant general of the
Russian army and aid-de-camp to the
Czar. He was a chevalier of the
order of St. Andre, the Black Eagle, ;
St. Hubert, the Elephant, the Annon- ;
ciade and of the Seraphines. He was ,
chief or colonel of several Russian |
military bodies as well as honorary
colonel of a regiment of Prussian 'â 
Uhlans and on the staff of a regiment i
of Austrian infantry.
Grand Duke Sergiue was credited ;
with having been the wealthiest mem- â¢
her of the imperial family and his land
holdings were second in extent only to
those of the Czar himself.
Much of the responsibility for the j
catastrophe at the coronation of Em
peror Nicholas in Moscow, when thou- :
sands of persons were crushed to death :
at the time of the distribution ot the i
Imperial gifts, was charged to Grand
Duke Sergius. It was held that he had j
noi taken sufficient precautions. Lib- j
erals, after the affair here of January
22. placed the major portion of the
blame upon his shoulders.
The sentence of death upon Grand |
Duke Sergius was contained in a proc
lamation issued by the Socialist Rev
olutionists of Moscow after the demon- !
stration on December 11 at last year in
St. Petersburg was put down. It read:
If our demonstration at Mo6cow (Decetabfr
18 and 19) is crufihod in as bloody a manner
a." that of our brothers of St. Petersburg, then j
be Kiiilt therefor upon the head of Grand Duke
Sergius and General Trepoff, and we, the com- j
mlttee, in that event, have foreordained their j
death.
At the time sentence of death was j
pronounced by the terrorists upon j
Grand Duke Sergius it was reported !
that Grand Duke Alexis, Procurator of j
the Holy Synod Pobiedonostieff ahd j
General Trepoff, then Chief of Police !
of Moscow and now Governor General j
of St. Petersburg, were also condemned )
to death, and according to some re- I
ports similar sentence waa imposed j
upon the Dowager Empress.
The Governor Generalship of Mos
cow was abolished early in the year i
and the Grand Duke, according to dis- '
patches from Moscow on January 4,
kept closely to the well-guarded Dis
koutohny Palace, on the outskirts of
Moscow, retaining his position as Com
mander-in-Chief of the military dis
trict. Later in January, however, it
was announced that the Grand Duke
had sought refuge in one of the palaces
of the Kremlin. He has been classed
â a the most reactionary member of the j
imperial family and as the head of
what is referred to as the war party,
and has been stigmatized by the Lib
erals as "Russia's evil genius."
As Governor General of Moscow he
was intensely unpopular. His advent
as Governor General was followed by
expulsion of the Jews from the central
provinces and throughout his admin
istration his rigorous and harsh meas
ures aroused the greatest hostility,
especially among the students. Two
years ago, after the student riots in
which many were killed or wounded,
several hundred expulsions to Siberia
followed under the orders of Grand
Duke Sergius and General Trepoff.
As there were many threats made |
against his life, the Grand Duke
was obliged to flee to his summer resi- I
dence, twenty miles from the city. I
During the recent strike disturbances '
the Grand Duke left the Diskoutohny j
Palace on the outskirts of the city j
where he had been living and took
refuge inside the ramparts of the !
Kremlin', where he had since lived in
what is known as the Little Palace,
opposite the famous statue of Alex- j
ander 11. The trip to the Kremlin on i
that occasion waa made at night, be- J
tween solid lines of troops.
Grand Duke Sergius was tall, hand
some and cordial in manner, in spite
of the ruthless fashion in which he
exercised his authority a* Governor
General. His record as a soldier waa
not brilliant. He suffered a disastrous
defeat at the hands of General Kuro- j
patkin during the famous Koursk
maneuvers.

PREPARING
TO INDICT
i POLITICIAN
Continued From Page 1, Column 7.
He was then sworn and so far as the
accessory charge is concerned he was
forthwith immuned from prosecution
under the provision of section 304 of
the Political Code.
"The District Attorney will swear to
the information against Kelly to-mor
row," said Senator Belshaw. "It is
not true that it was my intention to
swear to the information against him
and I deem that this would be im
proper in view of the position I oc
cupy as chairman of the committee.
However, the District Attorney appre
ciates the gravity of the situation and
all we can do is to give our testimony
which will prove that Mr. Kelly did not
tell the truth while under oath before
the committee this afternoon."
Chairman Belshaw announced that
the committee would meet Sunday
evening for the purpose of preparing
its report in the matter of the investi
gation of the charges oi bribery against
Emmons, Bunkers, French and Wright.
"No matter what may be the result
of the proceedings in court against the
accused," said Senator Belshaw, "we
will not reopen the case and swear the
accused. Even if the demurrers to the
indictments are sustained we will not
swear the accused. We have been in
structed by the Senate not to swear
them and a mere technicality in the
law that may be invoked in their favor
will not cause us to disobey the in
structions of the Senate."
It is certain that when the verdict
of the committee is handed to the Sen
ate it will call for the expulsion of all
of the accused. There is no question
but that the guilt of Emmons, Bunk
ers, French and Wright has been es
tablished to the full satisfaction of the
committee and that it will voice its
conviction without fear or favor.
To-morrow morning the accused will
be called for arraignment. Then the
defense will interpose its demurrers.
GRAND DUCHESS WARNED.
Advised by Revolutionists Not to Ap
pear With Her Husband.
PARIS. Feb. 17. â The assassination
of Grand Duke Sergius caused a sen
sution here. The Temps says:
It la easy to see why Gi%nd Duke S*rglus
was marked out as a victim of the revolution
ists-, as among all the uncles of the Em
peror Serglus had the greatest Influence upon,
him. It waa known that the Kmperor's vari
Â«Ub liberal efforts were checked through
Strglus. The Grand Duke was unpopular ia
Mohcow. owing to his haughty demeanor and
harsh reactionary spirit, although the Grand
Inichesg Elizabeth was popularly adored. Re
cently she was warned not to appear with
her husband, which meant thai his assassina
tion had been derided upon. It is significant
that the assassins pursued the same plans
a>j on the occasion of the assassination of the
l&to Interior Minister Yon Plehwe.
President Loubet, Premier Rouvler
and the entire Ministry and all the
foreign Embassadors have forwarded
expressions of sympathy to the Rus
sian embassy. Grand Duke Paul, the
victim's brother, who is a resident of
Paris, learned the news late in the day
and is prostrated.
FOUR MARKED FOR DEATH.
Nicholas, Trepoff and Bouligan Sen
tenced by Assassins.
BERLIN, Feb. 17.â The news of the
assassination of Grand Duke Sergius
reached the Russian Embassy here
first, through a newspaper correspond
ent. Travelers from St. Petersburg
who have arrived in this city say it
was common talk there that the terror
ists had marked four persons for as
sassinationâthe Emperor, Grand Duke
Sergius, Governor General Trepoff of
St. Petersburg and Interior Minister
Bouligan.
Emperor William was not present to
night at the annual banquet of the
Prussian House of Lords, absenting
himself out of respect to the late
Grand Duke Sergius of Russia. The
Grand Duke was a well-known per
sonality in Germany, where he had re
ceived many honors at the hands of
the ruling family. He held the high
est Prussian order, the Black Eagle,
and also the Order Pour le Merite,
which was Instituted by William I.

j festo, saying that a heavy sorrow has
| fallen upon the imperial house in th*e
j lamented death of his uncle, Grand

He was stricken down by the ruthless hand
â  of an assassin, who aimed at his life, io dear
to us. Mourning in him an uncle and friend,
whose whole life of activity and care waÂ»

BUSY DAYS IN STORE FOR THE LAWMAKERS
AS THE END OF LEGISLATURE APPROACHES
Senate Committee Fa
. vorsi Unlimited
Session Plan.
Proposed Constitu
tional Amendment
Is Introduced.
Special Dispatch to Th 6 Call.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 17.â The pres
ent Legislature is determined that a
constitutional amendment relative to
the length of sessions, compensation
of members and limitation of patron
age shall go through. This morning
the committee to which a series of
proposed Amendments had been sub
mitted introduced a substitute for the
whole, which, it is believed, will meet
with the approval of, all.
The committee substitute provides
for an unlimited session, but limits the
time in which bills may be introduced
to forty days. The compensation of
members is fixed at $1000 a year and
the patronage of each house is limited
to $500 a day. It further provides that
the sessions shall begin the first
Monday after the first day of Febru
ary and in order to get around the
necessity on general election years of
the Legislature meeting to canvass
the vote for Governor and Lieutenant
Governor, the proposed amendment
vests the Secretary of State with this
authority. The proposed amendment
will come up for discussion on the
floor next week.
The Senate Committee on Drainage,
Swamp and Overflowed Lands filed a
substitute this morning for the several
bills that have been introduced to es
tablish the Sacramento Drainage Dis
trict. The most important change con
tained in the committee substitute Is
that it excludes Marysville from the
district. It provides for the election,
instead of appointment, of a Drainage
Commission of nine members, two
from Sacramento County, one from San
Joaquin, one from Solano, one from
Yolo, one from Colusa, one from Sut
ter, one from Tuba and Placer jointly
and one from Glenn and Butte jointly.
The commission is vested with the
power to levy assessments and per
form any legal functions necessary' to
carry out the purposes of the act. The
compensation of members is fixed at
$10 a day while actively engaged, such
compensation not to exceed for any
one member $1000 a year.
Another bill was introduced in the
Senate this morning the purpose of
which is to put a curb on corporations
that fraudulently advertise their
affairs for the purpose of swindling the
public in the sale of stock. Under the
terms of the bill introduced to-day this
offence is made a felony.
Senator McKee's bill to promote the
education of nurses, to provide for the
issuance of certificates of registration
to qualified applicants by the xioard
of Regents of the University of Cali
fornia and to provide penalties for the
violation thereof, finally passed the
Senate and was sent to the Assembly,
where three bills of like import are
now under consideration.
Rush's bill to prevent the sale of in
toxicating liquors In the neighborhood
of the Veterans' Home at Yountville
also passed the Senate, after which an
adjournment till Monday morning was
taken.
BLOW AT SCHEMERS.
Bill to Prevent Land Frauds in This
State Before Senate.
, SACRAMENTO, Feb. 17.â An im
portant bill was introduced in the
Senate to-day by Simpson of Ala
nv;da, the purpose of which is to pre
vent, if possible, a repetition in this
State of the land frauds that have held
the attention of the Federal courts for
the last two years. The bill was
drafted by Frances J. Heney, present
United States District Attorney of Ore
gon, at the Instance of Governor Par
dee.
The bill provides that hereafter when
the Federal Government shall lay out
any forest reserve in this State the
State shall immediately relinquish all
rights it may have to any school lands
that may be contained within the boun
daries of such forest reserve and select
in lieu thereof equal acreage outside
of such forest reserve, the lieu lands
to be selected by the Surveyor Gen
eral of the State. It is further pro
vided in the bill that upon the selec
tion of such lieu lands the same shall
be offered for sale to the highest bidder
under rules to be formulated by the
Surveyor General and the Governor.
As the law now stands public lands
are sold at the uniform price of $1 25
an acre. Tt is held that the new plan
will bring greater revenue to the State.
Under the present system private
holders of lands in forest reserves may
st*- p their property of timber and then
take In lieu thereof other timbered
iands. The end of this practice will
come, however, If the Heney bill is
passed.
SMITH INVESTIGATION.
Assembly Committee Hears Evldenoe
Against Superior Judge.
SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 17.â The Investi
gation into the charges preferred
against Judge Smith is proceeding
slowly. Witness Leonard to-day told
the investigators that he had called on
Judge Smith in his chambers and that
Smith had there said to him: "John,
you have the best kind of a damage suit,
but you have ruined it by examining a
certain witness. You would better have
let the physicians examine him and
had him bend and squeal."
The charge that Smith had allowed
Attorney Cassin to commit an unpro
voked assault upon the person of
Thomas Dakan without punishment or
reprimand, and that he had punished
Dakan for defending himself, was gone
into. Hiram Faneuf, Thomas Dakan
and Charlea B. Younger Jr., an attor
ney, testified that C'assin struck the
first blow; that the Dakans were fined
and that Cassin was not punished.

Adjournment Is
Asked For.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 17.â Waste of
Alameda. who has heretofore been one
of the strongest opponents of adjourn
ments from Friday to Monday, moved
for such an adjournment to-day, ex
plaining that the Ways and Means
Committee wished to report thÂ« gener
al appropriation bill and such special
appropriation bills as may be favored
to the House on Monday. The com
mittee needed all the time In the in
terim to finish the work, which had
been carried on diligently from the
early part of the session, he said, many
of the meetings of the committee last
ing until after midnight.
Jury, chairman of the Public Print
ing Committee, said that owing to the
many bills and amendments the print
ing office was clogged with work and
that it would be necessary to adjourn
over as requested to allow it to
catch up.
Duryea, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, said that committee had
150 bills still before it for considera
tion, and asked that the members re
main in town and consider them. The
adjournment was taken as requested.
The Assembly reversed itself again
to-day by defeating the Woodward
banking bill by a heavy vote when the
measure was reconsidered on motion of
Btanton. The bill fixes the minimum
capital stock of country banks at
$10,000. It was passed in the Assembly
yesterday after having once been de
feated and to-day's vote is the third
that has been taken on it. An agent
of the Bankers' Association did the
missionary work among the members
that killed the bill to-day by a vote of
53 to 11.
Assemblyman Pyle secured this
morning a reconsideration of the vote
by which the anti-compulsory vaccina
tion bill was defeated yesterday and
the measure will be specially consid
ered again next Tuesday.
The defeat in the Assembly of the
bill passed by the Senate empowering
the Board of State Harbor Commis
sioner to insure the property under its
control on the bay of San Francisco
was the surprise of the afternoon ses
sion of the lower house. The fight
against it was led by Anthony of San
Francisco. There is already a statute
allowing the Harbor Board to Insure
for a fixed amount, but the bill now
before the Legislature extends its pow
ers and permits it to insure for three
quarters of its value all property con
trolled by it, which includes the several
new dock's that have been constructed.
There was barely a quorum present
and the bill was beaten by a vote of
33 to 8. It will be reconsidered Monday
when nearly the full membership of
the House will be present and will
most likely be passed with several
votes to spare.
MRS. CHADWICK
AGAIN IN COURT
CLEVELAND, Feb. 17. â When the
hearing of Mrs. Cassie L. Chadwick's
bankruptcy case was called to-day
Mrs. Chadwick, attired in the same
brown costume that she wore when
she appeared in the United States Dis
trict Court on the day of her arrival
from New York, appeared to plead to
the- charges against her. She examined
each of the claims against her in a
critical manner and rejected a num
ber of them wholly or in part.
Among those repudiated by Mrs.
Chadwick was the claim of Freda
Swanstrom, her maid, who presented
a sworn statement showing that her
employer owed her for seven months'
service at ?45 a month. Mrs. Chad
wu k declared that she did not owe the
maid so much. When a small bill for
a manicuring set was passed to Mrs.
Chadwirk for examination she disdain
fully tossed it back to her attorney,
saying: "Why, that is absurd; I
never owned such a thing in my life."
The claims taken up at to-day's ses
sion of the court were generally of
minor importance, none of the big ac
ccunts being passed upon.
TWO ATTACHES

Lieutenant Cuvervllle, the French

Lieutenant Guggenheim, the German

August m a junk. Since then they
have not been seen. A reward of

CZAR AND MINISTERS
HOLD PEACE COUNCIL
END OF WAR IS NEAR!
JAPANESE TERMS
ARE MADE KNOWN
Emperor William Said to Be
Exerting Influence
to Stop Strife.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 18.â Even
in the midst of the excitement caused
by the assassination of Grand Duke
Sereiua there has been a noticeable and
sudden revival of j?eace talk. It is in
timated that Prince Frederick Leopold
of Prussia 1b the bearer of personal
representations from Emperor William
on this subject.
The question of peace with Japan
was formally considered by Emperor
Nicholas and his Ministers at the con
ference at Tsarskoe-Selo yesterday.
Before the discussion began the Em
peror exacted from each one present a
solemn promise not to divulge the
slightest hint of what occurred. The
belief is, however, that the possible
conditions and terms were under con
sideration.
It is suggested in high quarters that
some intimation of terms has reached
the Russian Government from Japan,
although it is certain that it did not
come through the regular diplomatic
channels.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.â The Jap
anese operations against Mukden are
causing some concern to the United
States and to other governments that
are anxious that this war shall not dis
turb the integrity of China and the
"open door." The reason the United
States so strongly desires peace now is
that it probably could be made amid
Buch encircling international influences
that there would be no disturbance of
the balance of power and no resultant
land grabbing of Chinese territory.
But, with Japan possibly in posses
sion of Mukden, with Harbin as its
next objective, so much of Manchuria
will be held by Japanese troops that it
will be hard for Japan to content it
self simply with paramount interests
in Korea and only such interests
in Manchuria as all the powers would
have under the "open door" policy. In
other words, it is feared that, with
continued Japanese success, it will be
as hard to get Japan out of Manchuria
after this war as were the unsuccess
ful efforts to make Russia evacuate it
after the Boxer outbreak. There is
quod ground for thp belief that this
condition is exerting a great measure
of influence in the keen desire for peace
of all great neutral powers, including
even France, which is Russia's ally,
and England, which is Japan's ally.
t areful inquiries at the various em
bassies and at the State Department
disclose an apparent unanimity of
opinion concerning the actual prospect
of peace. By most of the diplomatists
with whom The Call correspondent
talked to-day, the situation is viewed
,about like this: That Japan, having
'made its greatest effort, is ready for
peace: that the Russian Emperor him
self would like peace, but fears it"
would bring inevitable loss of prestige;
that President Roosevelt, the German
Emperor, and the French and English
governments desire peace more ardent
ly every day; that the prospect of
peace would be vastly improved if
Russia gained a single victory on land
or on sea.
CLOSE WATCH OX THE LENA.
HÂ«eape to Russia of Three Men
Arouses Uncle Sam.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.â The
State Department has invited the at
tention of the Russian Government to
the fact that three officers of the
Russian transport Lena, who were
interned at San Francisco, have bro
ken their parole and are now in St.
Petersburg. The men are Engineer
S. Kopazin and Midshipman Peter
Michaeloff and Andrew Kyra Danyan.
Secretary Hay has notified the Rus
sian Government of the facts in the
case, making no demand for the re
turn of the men, but simply leaving
it to the Russian Government to do
the proper thing in this case.
The Japanese Government is aware
of the escape of the Russian officers,
but it has made no protest so far,
evidently inspired by a conviction that
the United States Government has
been adopting every customary pre
caution to insure the observance of
strict neutrality in its ports.
That such a thing will not happen
again is certain, for under instruc
tions from the Navy Department Ad
miral McCalla has taken steps to keep
constantly informed of the where
abouts of ever>' one of the officers and
crew of the Lena.
WOMEN APPEAL, TO CZARINA.
Ask That She Use Her Influence to
Bring War to an End.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 18. â The
Empress of Russia has received from
the women of Moscow an address pit
eously appealing to her, as a woman
and a mother, to use her influence
with the Emperor to secure peace.
The petition says:
Oh, Sovereign, we believe your mother heart
feels all the horrors of war as we do. Peace
is violated not only beyond the frontiers, but
even in *he heart of the fatherland. We pee
in recent troubles the beginning of calamities
that may crush all Russia, if the Emperor
does not seek to avert them. All the ba?es
of life are shaken and all the moral founda
tions are trembling. Mothers who have to
bring up the young generation are saddened
by seeing that it Is impossible to train up
rhlWrm on the basts of truth, love and duty
when the social life of the country does not
res; thereon. Our best forces are perishing.
Mothers whose hearts are breaking cannot re
main silent. More lives will be sacrificed, be
cause what is happening is not spasmodic,' but
the results of earlier calamities.
The Emperor can still cave Russia by his
puissant will. Be our pleader. Pray the Em
peror to listen to the voice of the country. If
the Emperor leads the country in paths of
greatness its women will help in the work of
organization by guiding their brothers and
children into the new way and a life of light.
Japanese Advancing Toward Harbin.
HARBIN, Feb. 17. â The Japanese
attacks on a bridge across the Sian

Large parties were discovered at

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL", SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 18, 1905.
BITTERLY SCORES
SLAV COMMANDER
Grippenberg Blames Kuro
patkin for the Defeat at
Sandepas.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. Gen- j
era! Grippenberg returned last night j
from Tsarskoe-Selo, having been sum- :
moned thither by a personal j message
from the Emperor to report at once.
Among General Kuropatkin's friends, i
General Grlppenberg's open criticism |
of the commander-in-chief in the Far j
East is deeply resented, it being said j
that General Grippenberg, by his . own ,
admission, disobeyed orders by going J
beyond Sandepas. His public criticism j
of General Kuropatkin is regarded by j
the friends of the latter as a breach of j
discipline, for which he will be called !
to account.
The general frankly avows that he
relinquished his command after the
recent attempt of the. Russians to
flank Field Marshal Oyama because, j
as he claims, General Kuropatkin re- I
fused to send him help when victory I
was in General Grippenberg"s \ hands, j
ordering him to withdraw instead. In
an interview General Grippenberg
said:
I am glad to give an account of the battle
of my army, the telegrams I have seen being
far from the .truth. Kuropatkin, of course.
authorized the advance, but' he imposed the
condition that it should not gt> beyond Hel- i
koutal and Sandepas. My plan was to cap
ture Halkoutal and thence outflank Sandepas.
Prom the First Army Corps before Helkoutal
I detached a brigade, which occupied Hal
koutai on January 25. The Japanese cut in j
from the south and the brigade came under
a cross-fire, but held on until I got up an- :
other brigade to cover its retreat. The Jap- I
i anese were now concentrating on their left, j
During the evening of January 25 I and my i
army were ordered under no circumstances
to fall back from our positions. The . next j
morning: my whole front was engaged. Alto- I
gether I had sixty-two battalions. The enemy
had twice as many.
The battle of January 26 was continued until !
the evening. We did not surrender an Inch
or ground. My - left flank, which was i clear
ing the road to Sandepas,- being weak, I asked
the commander in chief, who had sixty bat- ;
talions available, for reinforcements. He de- i
clined to send any, apparently taking the !
Japanese demonstration at the center as be- j
ing a general advance. Nevertheless I de- â 
cided to storm Heikoutai the next day. All >
the surrounding villages were already in our I
hands.
Early on January 27 the fiercest fighting j
occurred. We again held our own. The road j
to Sandepas. the Japanese point of concen- â 
tration, was. quite clear of the enemy. I
therefore again appealed to the commander In ',
chief for reinforcements. If he had listened '
to my entreaties w e would have riven the |
Iron ring of 100.000 of the enemy. The Jap
anese, being menaced by ; a strong force of
Russian cavalry from the south and south- |
west, evidently realized the danger of tackling i
us. In desperation on January 28 they four i
times assaulted our outer positions and were ,
beaten off each time In such brilliant fashion !
that it does my heart good to remember the '
gallantry of my brave comrades. I might
easily have followed up these repulses by a
headlong offensive, hut I was tied down, by
the commander in chiefs restrictions and his
refusal to send me reinforcements.
How anxiously I awaited a reply on both I
subjects! Just think of what victory meant, j
Complete victory was in our grasp. The loss
of thousands of lives was not dreadful before !
such a result.
The reply of General Kuropatkin arrived at I
5 o'clock in the evening In the shape of an
order to leave a small force In our positions
and move up the army to his support, in
view of the expected Japanese advance on '
the center. How was It possible for the Jap- '
anese to attack the center when all their
available forces were diverted west?
It Is Impossible to describe the â¢ Impression
produced upon me by the order. At first r
was afraid to communicate it to my victorious
army, but there was nothing else to do. We
retreated during the night of January 29 with
tears In our eyes and bitterness in our hearts.
It was then I decided that my presence at
the theater of war was no longer possible
and the next day I handed in a report to
the commander in chief demanding my relief.
FRONTIER GUARDS AMBUSHED.
Russians Lose Heavily in Attempting
to Protect Siberian Railroad.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 17. â A
dispatoh from Saehetun. Manchuria.
s;iys that 11.000 Japanese troops and
Chinese bandits are reported to b* 5 in
Southeastern Manchuria, in the neigh
borhood of Chalbasochon, forty-five
miles northwest of Gunshu Pass,
whence they intend to operate against
the railroad. A detachment of Rtis-
Fian frontier guards, with two guns,
encountered the Japanese on Febru
ary 14 and defeated them. The de
tachment, however, while advancing,
was surrounded by two regiments of
Japanese cavalry, four companies of
infantry and a large band of Chinese
bandits about fifteen miles northwest
of Gunshu Pass and lost heavily. One
gun was lost and nearly all the gun
horses and a number of gunners were
killed.
RUSSIAN CAVALRY ON A RAID.
Fifteen Thousand Horsemen Pursued
by a Japanese Force.
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUAR
TERS, Feb. 17. â A Russian raiding
force of 15,000 cavalry, 500 infantry
and twenty guns moved south on both
banks of the Liao River to Siaopeho,
on the Hun River directly west of
Liaoyang, yesterday, and then began
gradually retreating to the northward.
The force is now twelve miles north
west of Siaopeho and three miles east
of the Liao. The Japanese pursued
and Inflicted damage on the raiders.
TOKIO EXPECTS A BATTLE.
Kuropatkin Is Preparing to Assume
the Aggressive.
TOKIO, Feb. 18.â According to re
ports from the Shahke River the Rus
sians are showing increasing activity
on both flanks and are extending and
strengthening their right. They also
seem to be concentrating a heavy force
on their left in front of General Ku
roki. Fushun is the base of the later
operations and It is estimated that the
Russians there number six divisions.
The impression exists that General
Kuropatkin is preparing to assume the
aggressive.

of Vaintashan, Tadzepu, Koitai and

ANSWEE ARGUMENT
OF PROSECUTION
Lawyers for Suspect Present
Their Case to the Jury and
Ask That a Verdict of Not
Guilty Be Their Conclusion
Special DlEpatch to The Cail.
â¢ AUBURN, Feb. 17.â Arguments by
counsel on both sides in the case of
Adolph Weber took up nearly all the
time of both sessions of the court to
day. One witness was examined, J.
R, Brow of San Francisco, an auc
tioneer. Brow's testimony was to the
effect that Pawnbroker Carr's charac
ter was bad.
Young Weber looked unusually well
to-day. No nervousness was apparent
and there was nothing in his demeanor
to show that the ordeal of yesterday
had left an impression. He smiled oc
casionally during: the argument of his
counsel and once laughed heartily at
an assertion made by Attorney Tuttle.
The three attorneys who participated
in to-day's proceedings were Ben Ta
bor and Fred P. Tuttle for the defense
and District Attorney Kelly Robinson.
Attorney Tabor opened the morning
session. He spoke for four hours. His
argument to the jury was made in a
quiet manner and was devoid of even
a suspicion of oratorical effort. In
part he said:
The prosecution had not shown that thÂ«
hand of Adolph Webor caused the death of
Mary "Weber. Gentlemen of the Jury, even If
you believe In the "so-called chain of evi
dence" that has he?n forged by the prosecu
tion, you cannot find tlie defendant guilty.
Now as to the evidence of Henry Caxr. That
man was rot tilling the truth when he said
he had sold the revolver to this boy. Even
If you are willing to take Carr's testimony
and believe that he sold that weapon to the
boy. you must see that It does not show that
the defendant is guilty. The prosecution has
presented a sort of conundrum. They say, if
he did not kill Mr?. Weber, who did? I
would to God I knew who killed Mrs. Weber.
I know that that boy would give all that he
possessed to know who killed his mother.
SCORES OWN WITNESSES.
May Clark's testimony is to be regarded in
the same light as the testimony of Myrtle Hall j
and Lottie Smith. They are all outcasts from |
society, and the story of one is worth as much :
as the story of the other. It was not the fault j
of the defense that Bertha Weber's name was :
connected with theirs. The defense knew that f
there never lived in Auburn a girl with a more '
beautiful character and lovable disposition than i
Bertha Weber. Thip boy stands here with the i
whole State of California against him. Every :
power p'.isweKyed by this great State is ar
rayed against this boy â this boy who has n%
father, mother, sister or brother to help him.
Tabor then referred to Pawnbroker
Carr's identification of Weber as the i
youth to whom he had sold a revolver ,
nearly a year ago. Tabor said:
Was triers not a possibility that Carr made a I
mistake? Could he hot have been mistaken In '
his belief that Weber bought a weapon from
him? Gentlemen of the jury, have you never :
mistaken one person for another? It is an j
easy matter, as this little Incident will show: ;
A certain man was accused of having stabbed >
a man In the back. He was tried, convicted
on circumstantial evidence and hanged. Sev
eral years after a murderer about to be hanged
stated before he went to the scaffold that he
: had committed the crime.
Referring to the mental condition of
j Adolph Weber on the night of the trag
. edy, Tabor asked the jury to remem
| ber the terrible strain Weber must
; have boen laboring under that awful
, nisrht when he saw his home burned
I and thÂ« bodies of his father, mother,
! sister and brother dragged from the
, ruins. He pleaded with the jury to
| carefully weigh every bit of evidence
and give the defendant the benefit of
j any doubt.
District Attorney Robinson, for the
j prosecution, followed Tabor. Robinson
; carefully traced the movements ot
j Weber on the r.ight of tho tragedy, and
; after summing up the evidence said:
WEBER A MAR.
Tills defendant would not answer questions
when h'> wan examined by General Webb. To
fifty-four of General Webb's questions he an
s\vrrf>d, "I don't remember." He would not
tell the truth. Jurymen. I say it standing here
alone that the defendant is guilty. Jurymen, I
know you will do what is honest and fair, but
I hope you will not be overcome by Attorney
Johnson's eloquence. Either convict this de
fendant of the dreadful crime of murder with
which he is charged or else turn him loose on
the community.
Fred P. Tuttle, for the defense, com
menced his argument late in the aft
ernoon. He said, in part:
The defendant sitting there is entirely guilt
less of this crime. He din not know his fam
ily was in the house at the time of the fire.
We are only too anxious to find out who did
tills horrible deed. We are anxious to bring
the i*rpe.tratorÂ» of this terrible deed to the
bar of justice.
Mrs. Snowden. the nearest relative of the
murdered Mary Weber, has not played the part
she should in this terrible affair. Instead of
helping her nephew she has done all ahe could
to bring him to the gallows. The prosecution
claims the defendant bought a revolver last
July with the intention of murdering his fam
ily. They depict him as a walking arsenal,
marching nround with a gun, blackjack and
brass knuckles.
So far as Henry Carr is concerned, his reputa
tion has been proved had; witnesses have sworn
they would not believe him under oath. Lee
us pay, then, that he made a mistake when

The Redding Free Press* is authority
for the statement that the Trinity cop

Thomas W. Lawson, will Instal a 600
ton smelter. The same paper says that ',
the Great Western smelter will be ,
blown in next spring.
According to the Trinity Journal a ,
novel method is employed at the Head
light mine, near Carrvllle, Trinity
County, to uncover an ore body. The I
ledge Is covered with loam to the depth
of from ten to twenty feet, which in- 'â 
terferes with working. A ditch has
been dug from tbe Trinity River, giv
ing suffifient fall to hydraulic the sur- j
face for a distance of 300 feet up the I
mountain side. A giant and pipe have
been Installed and the surface dirt is j
bÂ«-ing washed away. j
The Mountain Lion mine, near Shas

DREDGING THE KLONDIKE.
Men cf means have contracted for a I
large gold dredging machine for the I
Klondike country, to be used on prop- â 
erty lying near the junction at Bonan
za Creek with the Klondike River and
about a mile above where the Klondike
enters the Yukon.' Large quantities of
auriferous gravels have been deposited
at th. place- The barge will be con
structed and the machinery taken on
board at Whitehorse. It will be floated
down and be ready to use in June. If
the venture turns out profitably many ;
other dredgers will be constructed for
use m the Yukon and the gold mining
industry may take on another phase,
precisely as it has in California 'since ;
the introduction of the dredger in the
OrovtUe district. The first dredger for i
gold in the Klondike. region will be 212
feet long over all and 40 feet beam. 'â .
The capacity for handling gravel will
be about 3000 tons a day.

A suit for divorce was filed yester- i

forth the contents of the affidavits in- j,

in Judge Kerrigan's court in an effort
to defeat the wife's suit for separate

opinion that the affidavits, which were
intended to support certain charges of i
Immorality against the wife, had noth-
Ing to do with the- maintenance case, i
and it was ordered that she should be '.
paid $50 a month and $75 for attor- â

ANOTHER BLOW
FOR OIL TRUST
Kansas Legislature Passes
3[easure Making Pipe Lines
of State Common Carriers
REFIXEBY BILL SIGNED
Fight On in Earnest Which
Has Been Planned to Force
Standard to Act Fairly
TOPEKA, Kan*.. Feb. 17.â The
Kansas House to-day, without a dis
senting vote, passed the bill making oil
pipe lines common carriers. This is
the second of the series of bills direct
ed against the Standard Oil Company
and was strongly opposed by the Stan
dard Oil interests. It has already
passed the Senate and will be signed
by the Governor. "Without this bill
the refinery plan could not have been
carried out successfully owing to the
lack of pipe lines owned by the State.
Now, however, the State oil can be
piped through the Standard's lines.
The anti-discrimination bill, designed
to prevent the Standard from under
selling the State refinery, will be made
a special order for next Monday.
This bill makes it unlawful for any
commodity to be sold in any one town
of the State lower than In another un
less such difference may be made nec
essary through freight rates. Thus the
Standard will be prevented from set
ting the price of oil to meet the State
price any place in the State unless it
reduces the price in the whole State.
A fight against the measure is being
waged by Kansas jobbers. The oil i
producers expect to be able to secure
Its passage, however. The anti-dis- j
crimination bill Is the Senate measure j
and the Senate threatens to secure its i
passage by holding up the House rail
road bill.
Governor Hoch at noon signed the :
bill passed on "Wednesday appropriat
ing $200,000 for the erection and main
tenance by the State of an oil refin- i
cry with a capacity of 2000 barrels a
day. The signing of this measure will ;
make It possible for Kansas to begin
In earnest the fight started in this
State recently against the Standard
Oil Company.
CHAXUTE, Kans., Feb. 17. â The ;
Standard Oil Company is again buying j
oil in the Chaoute district after refus
ing to take any for one week. The
construction of the pipe lines in the j
territory is also again in progress. The ';
Standard says it is taking only about i
10.000 barrels of oil out of the field. 'â 
but the producers say they are really J
getting more than that amount. Re
ports from Independence", Peru and I
other places indicate that the Standard
Is buying there also.
WASHINGTON*. Feb. 17.â Funds
with which to prosecute the inquiry
into the methods of the Standard Oil
Company in 'Kansas were asked of the
House to-day by Secretary Metcalf of
the Department of Commerce and La
bor. In his communication the Secre
tary pays that this inquiry cannot be
completed before July 1. His sugges
tion is that the unexpended balance of
an item of $45,000 and another of $15,
<KW. carried in the current legislative,
executive and judicial appropriation
act, be made available for this, as well
as all other work of Investigation
which his department is prosecuting.
These items were appropriated to
carry on the beef trust and other In
quiries.

MRS. NATIONS RUDENESS
MEDICINE LODGE, Kansas, Feb. .
17.â T0 use her own words, Carrie Xa- ,'
tion was yanked from a hack by her j
hair last midnight.
"Bill" Horn, widely known through- â 
out the Southwest as a "character," I
was the man who did the yanking.
Mrs. Nation made the charge in court
to-day. "Bill" admitted he was pres
ent at the informal emerging of Mrs.
Nation from the hack and assisted in ,
the process.
"She called me a drunken sot and :
... jerked a cigar out of my moufh." he â 
said to the jury, in extenuation.
The jury thought "Bill" was justified
in using force, because he had lost the :
better part of a 5-cent cigar, and the ;
verdict was "not guilty."
Mrs. Nation testified that Horn had ;
. not only ejected her from the carriage, ;
; but had thrown her into a snowdrift 'â¢â 
â¢ after beating and kicking her. She !
j said this was the first time she had j
j ever been scared by a man.

come to us are living reformed lives. It
must be remembered that this is a new
field, as the league not only seeks to
ameliorate the present discouraging
conditions of the prisons, but aims at
improving the laws concerning the men
In different sections of our * country.
The reports show that the men who
have joined the league are well be
haved during their incarceration."
Mrs. Booth visited Folsom Prison
last Saturday and Sunday. She left New
York on February 1 and went direct to
Fort Leaven worth, where she followed
up her work in the Federal prison. She
then visited Denver, Colorado Springs,
Canyon City prison and Reno, and
after her visit to Folsom went to ' Los
Angeles, Pasadena and Santa Barbara,
where she lectured to very large audi
ences.
To-morrow morning Mrs. Booth will
address the prisoners at San Quentin

HOUSE ACTION
ON STATEHOOD
Bill as Amended by Senate
St*nt to Conference With
out Opportunity for Debate
VOTE ON PAKTY LINK-
3JcLachlan of California the
Only Republican to Line
Up With the Opposition
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.â 1n order to j
facilitate action on the statehood bill â¢
at this session the House to-day passed I
a resolution sending that measure, as
amended by the Senate, into confer- j
ence, without offering an opportunity I
for debate. With j the exception of j
McLachlan of California, who voted
with the Democrats, party lines were
strictly drawn. * r .'â¢
Lloyd of Missouri charged that
thirty- five .Republicans who were in '
sympathy with the Democrats on the
statehood question â  had . been coerced
by rules and leadership.
.Williams of Mississippi said that
both New Mexico and Arizona desired
separate statehood. *?~;
"I challenge the fentlemea now. I
dare the majority of this House to let '
us have a vote on that question," he
eaid. ..
Referring 1 , to the so-called Republi
can recalcitrants, who had been whip- {
ped into line, "Williams - referred to '
them â â  as - "blanket Indians.** He said]
if they had been let alone and not been |
bound in writing hand and foot, the \
minority, plus those men, would have ]
been able to adopt the amendment as ,
to New -Mexico.
He provoked laughter when he com
paerd the Speaker with a noted In- \
dian chief named "Old Man Afraid of
His - Horses," and said the Speaker â¢
would go down in history as "Old Man j
Afraid of His Majority." }

With Stock of Company
WASHINGTON. Feb. 17.â Pan
ama Railroad Company is capitalized
at $7,000,000. Its gross assets are $15,
$50,000. of which 512,628,000 is the value
of the road, real estate, equipment,
terminals and steamships, the balance
being cash and treasury assets. The
bonded indebtedness of the property is
$3,155,000, of which the company owns
$887,000. The gross earnings of the
company for the past eleven months
were r5.561.35Ji. The expense of opera
tion was $1.R40,954. which includes $250,
000, the annual payment to Colombia:
interest on mortKages, $92,000; acquisi
tion of bonds by the company, $140,000,
leaving a balance of $538,374 to be ap
plied to dividends.
These facts were presented to-day to
the sub-committee of the House Com
mittee on Interstate and Foreign Com
merce, charged with an investigation
of the affairs of this company.
Other information developed at the
hearing was thÂ« fact that the mem
bers of the Panama Canal Commission,
who have been elected directors in the
company, receive the regular compen
sation of other directors, namely, $25
for attendance at the bi-monthly board
meetings and Commissioner Parsons
$10 for attending the bi-weekly meet
ings of the executive committee. Each
one of these directors and Commission
ers is credited with one share of stock
on the company's books and draws the
dividends declared on the same. Ad
miral Walker, chairman of the commis
sion, is credited with 100 shares of the
stock on the books of the company.
A feature of the session was the
questioning of Director- Brown by
Chairman Hepburn of the committee
with the declaration. "1 would like to
see how much the officers of this com
pany know about its business." He
asked:
"What salaries are there?"
"The president's salary is $10,000, the
vice president has a salary of about
$6000. There is a secretary's salary
and an auditor, traffic manager, pur
chasing agents and various others."
"What change has been made in the
salaries of these officers in recent
years?"
"None that I know of."
"Is it not true that the expense ac
count paid by the Panama Railroad
Company last year in the City of New
York aggregated about $200,000?"
"I coold not answer that."
Brown was allowed to give way on
the stand to Vice President Drake,
who v.as questioned by members of the
sub-committee at length as to details
of the bookkeeping of the company.
The last statement made by Drake was
that Admiral Walker had bought one
hundred shares of the stock of the
company and that each of the other
commissioner-dfrectorÃ was credited on
the books with one share and each re-"
ceived the dividends on his stock

Flint's Election Plays a
Part in Jfuitfcipa] Cam
paign in San Bernardino
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX BERNARDINO, Feb. 17.â The
municipal campaign in San Bernardino
is developing into a bitter fight. The
Democratic Central Committee met to
night and decided to hold a convention
and put a full ticket in the field. The
Republican Central City .Committee
last night took similar action.
Edward Roberts, president of the San
Bernardino National Bank and chair
man of the Republican Central Com
mittee; Stephen Kelley, postmaster
and State central committeeman; R.
C. Harbison, chairman Congressional
Committee, and Harold Barnum, ex
< nairman of the city Republican Cen
tral Committee, have been for many
years past opposed to the State or
ganization. With them .is A. G. Ken
dall.
At a meeting of the City Central
Committee, called by petition, Barnum
announced that he had filled two va
cancies on the committee, and from
the chair he filled a third and asked
the committee to approve his action.
Eleven members of the committee
balked, and when Barnum, Roberts and
the others retired, their places were
declared vacant by the stalwarts, who
filled the vacancies and made Dr. J.
M. Hurley chairman.
The Kelley faction has been bitterly
fighting th<? State organization since
the election of Senator Flint. Kelley
wanted to be made collector of the
port of San San Francisco and Har
bison aspired to succeed Kelley in the
local postofttce. Bard's defeat blocked
the schemers, hence the present fight
under the guise of moral reform.

WEST VIRGINIA
HAS A SCANDAL
Senators Make Grave Charges
Against Governor White
and Secretary of State
INQUIRY IS OEDERED
Executive Accused of Giving
an Appointment for Part
of the Fees of the Office
CHARLESTON, W. Va., Feb. 17.-
Several attacks on Governor White
and Governor-elect Dawson, now Sec
retary of State,, were made to-day by
State Senators, and a resolution was
passed ordering an investigation of the
verbal charges. The resolution as
passed contains the following para
graph:
Senators Marshall, McGinnls and Carrigan
were constituted an Investigation committee to
probe corruption charges made on the floor
of the Senate, in newspaper reports and what
ever may be gathered from the four winds.
In a speech that was rampant with
charges of illegal practices on the part
of Governor White and Secretary of
State Dawson, Senator Caldwell de
livered a fierce tirade against these of
ficials. Caldwell was followed by Sen
ator Cornwell, the recent Democratic
candidate for Governor.
Senator Caldwell, in making his
charges, said Governor White was
guilty of dividing with the Secretary
of State the fees of the latter office
in consideration of an appointment.
Caldwell also said a letter had been
sent out from New York by a Charles
ton attorney offering to secure a reduc
tion in the license tax on foreign cor
porations in consideration of half of
the decrease secured by legislation. He
also stated that White and Dawson
were back of this letter.
All of these charges, together with
the charges that Senators had accepted
bribes to oppose or advocate pending
legislation, will come under the review
of the investigating committee.
HIS KINDNKSS UNREWARDED.
Mr. K. I. A. .Take meets a small boy ;
and out of pun- kindness of heart '
glvea him a lesson in skating. The j
youngster meets with an unavoidable
accident tuid Mr. Jake is assaulted by ;

OAKLAND, Feb. 17.â Enraged be
cause his former queen has obtained a
divorce and married another man,
Meterio Bonavish, a Roumanian gipsy
king:, has sought revenge by kidnap
ping five of his children, who were
given by the court to the mother, now
Mrs. Mary Stanley, when the divorce
was granted. One of the children,
Maretsa, a girl fourteen years of age,
was stolen last summer, while the
mother was camped near Marysville.
The father later sold the child to a
fellow gipsy, Michael Stancovich, for
1700. After buying the girl, Btancovich
by means of beatings and threats
forced the girl to marry him. The
ceremony was performed at Marys
ville by the Rev. Father Coleman, in
July, 1&04, the father having falsely
stated that the child was eighteen
years of age.
Previous to the kidnaping of the
girl the father had induced a son,
Frank Bonavish, to leave his mother.
He taught the boy to steal and then
turned him adrift. The lad is now
in the Whittier Reform School. /
Last night Bonavish, who is camped
with a band of gipsies in Fruitvale,
stole another of the children, Clara,
10 years old. This morning the
mother swore out a warrant for his
arrest. While she was at the police
station the father, accompanied by his
eldest son, came to the tent of Mrs.
Stanley and lured the two youngest
children, Rosie, age 8, and Edna Beat
rice, age 6 years, from the tent and
carried them away. The mother re
turned to find the tent deserted. Al
most crazed by the latest act of her
former husband she hurried again to
the police and reported the loss of the
last of her. little ones.
A policeman was sent at once to the
camp of Bonavish at Fruitvale, but
the wily gipsy, fearing pursuit, had
not gone there Â«but >-d taken the
children to some other i lace for safe
keeping. The members of his band
denied any knowledge cf his where
abouts, saying that the "captain" had
gone to San Francisco early In the
morning. Up to a late hour to-night .
he had not returned to his camp.
The warrant for the arrest of Bona
vish is now in the hands of the police,
but Mrs. Stanley fears he will escape.
Mrs. Stanley, who is a gipsy fortune ;
teller at 616 Broadway, tells the fol
lowing story of her ex-husband's per
secution since she was divorced from
Bonavish In 1901:
Bonavljh. who sometimes goes under the
name of iKanowitch, was cruel to me almost
from the day of our marriage, and I finally
got a divorce t rom him In Colorado on June
12, 1001. , Shortly afterward I married my

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 17.
The Board ot Trade and the Mer
chants' Exchange to-day adopted reso
lutions condemning the proposed
"grade crossing" bill that has been
passed by the Assembly and is before

Objections to the measure were made j
to-day before the local organizations
by E. P. Vandercook and Marvel E.
Cerf, representing the Western Pacific
Railroad, the new transcontinental sys
tem which recently procured a fran
chise to run through Oakland. Cerf i
said the bill, if it should become, a law,
would, in his opinion, prevent that road
1 from coming into California; that it
would give existing railroads the option
to control the methods of crossings
in such a way as to be practically a
bar to new lines.
The Merchants' Exchange adopted
the following resolution:
Whereas, There Is now pending: in the leg
islature of California Assembly bill No. 472
and Senate bill No. 341. which are identical
in form, and which provide legislation for
railroad crossings: and
Whereas, Said bills would be a great detri
ment to the building of new railroads, both
steam and electric, and would thus stifle com
petition and retard progress; therefore, be it
Resolved, by the Merchants' Exchange of
Oakland. That we are opposed to the passage
oi said Senate bill No. 341 and Assembly bill
No. 472. and strongly urge the Alameda
County leglslatiYe delegation to use their best
efforts to defeat the passage of these bills.
D. C. Brown and Wilbur Walker, rep
resenting the exchange, will go to Sac
ramento to flght the bill.
The Board of Trade adopted the fol
lowing:
Whereas, We regard the bills now before
the Legislature of thi> State known as Sena/e
bill No. 341 and Assembly bill So. 473. con
cerning; grade crossing*, as inimical to the
interests of our community as well as against
the best interests of the State of California;
and
Whereag, The passaee of the bill in its pres
ent form might retard the building and would
result in preventing and hamper) ng the opera
tion of competing railroads, both steam and
electric; nowr therefore, be it
Resolved. That we, directors of the Oakland
Board of Trade, urge our representatives in
the Legislature to use every proper means
and exert every effort to defeat said Senate
bill Xn. 341 and Assembly bill No. 472.
Resolved. That a copy of these resolutions
be sent to each member of the House and

BOARDMAN NOW
HAS GUARDIAN
Aged Millionaire Admits His
Incompetency and Asks
Palmanteer's Appointment
YOUNG WIFE WINS OUT
Succeeds in Preventing Octo
genarian Husband From
Giving Estate to Charities
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
103 1> Broadway, Feb 17.
Rather than take his chances of
standing his trial on the charge of ln
competency made against him by his
wife. Millionaire Joseph Boardman
acknowledged at the opening of the
hearing this afternoon that he was not
capable of looking out for his affairs
and asked Judge Ogden to appoint W.
G. Palmanteer of the Central Bank as
his guardian. The move was entirely
I unexpected by his young wife, but her
attorneys snid they were only anxious
to stop Boardman from giving away
his property. Palmanteer would be
agreeable to Lhem, and he was appoint
ed forthwith and his bond fixed at
$150,000.
Boardman is over 80 years old. A
few years ago he married Blanche
Walker, js years of age, by whom he
has one child. It recently came to the
knowledge of Mrs. Boardman that her
husbnnd was about to give away a
large part of his estate to the Y. M. C.
A. and other institutions. She imme
diately began proceedings. Boardman's
income from his property in San Fran
cisco amounts to $.15,000 a year. His
property in Oakland yields $7500 a year.
He has $75,000 cash in bank and money
invested in the Realty Syndicate.
Many witnesses were summoned in
the matter, but owing to the action
taken by Boardman the expected legal
*fight was not necessary. Aged and bent,
Koardrnan said he would like to be
sworn. He asked for the protection of
the court, admitting that he could not
properly care fcr his property, request
ing the appointment of Palmanteer.

of Assistant Astronomer Aitken's in
vestigation of the motion of the comet
discovered by Borrelly at Marseilles
on December 28. Instead of being
merely a transient visitor, as most
comets are, Aitken finds that this
comet is a member of the solar sys
tem and that it makes a complete
revolution about the sun once in seven
years and three months.
It reached its point of nearest ap
proach to the sun on January 16,
passing between the orbits of the
earth and Mars. In about three and
one-half years it will reach the fur
ther limit of its orbit and will then be
outside of the orbit of Jupiter.

STUDENTS MUST
FURNISH BONDS
Sophomore Class Takes First
Action in Preparing to
Protect Its Treasury
LEAENS BY EXPERIENCE
Honor System Is All Eight,
but Youths Who Handle
Money 3lust Give Security
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center street, Feb. 17.
For the first time in the history of (
the university class officers who handle
money entrusted to them as managers
of class enterprises will be put under
bonds, as is done in commercial life or
in public office. The sophomore claaa
decided to-day that its officers, some
of whom will have charge of many
thousands of dollars, shall all grive se- j
curity, to be regularly provided by a |
first-class surety company.
The action taken by the sophomore j
class is, in part, the result of George j
W. Lauder's defalcation a year ago.
when he was business manager of the
Occident magazine, a university pub
lication, and the sophomore class treas
urer. He came to the college from St.
Helena and was prominent in all the
activities of his class.
Lauder belonged to the Phi Kappa
Sigma, an exclusive fraternity, and
this society later assumed the respon
sibility of making good his peculations.
His accounts as class treaurer were in
bad shaoe before he left with funds
belonging to the Occident magazine's
treasury.
The fraternity men shielded htm in
the first instance and his cash, as class
treasurer, was made to balance. Lau
der disappeared soon after, however,
with several hundred dollars of Occi
dent coin and has not been heard of
since.
Because of this and of similar af
fairs the students believe that business
customs should prevail where business
is done by college classes. The sopho
more class has taken the initiative and
at a meeting this morning appointed
H. E. Sherman chairman of a com
mittee to submit a Hat of the bonds un
der which class officers are to be put.
The business manager of the Blue
and Gold will have the heaviest bond,
and his probably will be for pot less
than $10,000. In his position he handles
more money than any other class of
ficer. The bonds of other class officers
will be in proportion.
The class this morning nominated the
following sophomores for positions on
the 'Blue and Gold of '07: Editor, R.
Oabbert and Gurden Edwards; busi
ness manager. Jack Eggers and J.
Hastings. The election is to take place
a week from to-day.
HER WARDROBE RUINED.

GRAND JURORS LOOKING
INTO SCHOdL CONDITIONS
Xccd of More Room and of Play
Grounds Kmphutk'alljr Brought
to Their Attention.
The educational authorities of San
Francisco agree with Jacob Riis that
"the right of the hoy to play ball
should be held as sacred as the ris:ht
of habeas corpus." and they are now
seeking the influence of the Grand
Jury toward providing play grounds at
the school buildings. Yesterday sev
eral of the members of the inquisitor
ial body, accompanied by the Board
of Education and Superintendent
I^angdon, visited the Franklin School
on Eighth street, near Harrison.
"I sllow the boys of this vicinity to
play in this yard every afternoon till
4:30 o'clock." explained Mrs. Wood,
the principal, pointing to the meager
si'ace in the rear of the school build
ing. "You can see that th*Â» boys have
to use the walls and windows against
which to play handball. "
Then the jurors proceeded to see the
"ragtags of society," the boys in the
Parental School. It is likely that sub
stantial financial liberality for this
school by the municipality will be
recommended. The little fellows,
whose home conditions for the most
part drive them to run away, to sleep
i:i dry goods boxes, boxcars, ware
houses and lumber yards and to live
on money they earn principally by
selling newspapers, were the object? of
much interpst on the part of the grand
jurors. Superintendent Langdon wants
t â¢ have a dormitory provided for so
that the entire care can be taken of
the- little fellows that parents neglect.

Snoceeded in Running the
Blockade Into Vladivostok
Th* Pa-cfflo Mall Company's bis;
freighter. Alsna. -which arrived yester
day from the Orient, encountered a
succession of terrific easterly gales
which lasted to -within a few hundred
miles of the California coast. Her
cargo, SS2S tons of coal from Mororan,
kept her stiff and steady, but her tow
ering sides were not nigh enough to
prevent the green seas from forming
fantastic loops on her deck.
For two days one â watch tended the
Alcoa's fires and engines. The seas
that swept the decks made It impos
srble for either the firemen or engi
neers in the engine room to reach their
quarters or for the "watch below, when
the time came to relieve the men on
duty, to reach the engine room. After
two days* imprisonment the weather
bound watch was relieved and, with the
help of life lines, engineers and firemen
drag:p<?d themselves along the wave
washed deck to their sleeping quarters.
Two firemen narrowly escaped being
washed overboard. They were carry-
Ins a basket of ashes across the deck
â¢when a big green sea caught them and
flammed them with ' great violence
against the rail Their shipmates
grabbed them and dragged them to a
place of safety. Both men were pretty
badly shaken up, but soon recovered.
Pilot Alex Swanson boarded the Al
goa outside and this time the freighter
was brought safely into port. The last
time she arrived here. Captain Lockett,
then the Algoa's commander, now her
mate, tried to do the piloting himself,
with the result that he knocked a big
hole in her bow. When the freighter
struck, panic seized the Chinese crew
and, armed with knives, the Mon
golians made a mad rush for the boats.
They would have launched the boats
and deserted the ship had not the
white officers, armed with clubs, driv
en the yellow men back to their posts.
The Algoa was twenty days coming
from Mororan. She will dock to-day
at Folsom-street wharf, where she will
discharge her cargo of coal.
Fonr Sailors Swept Overboard.
According to the officers of the Algoa four
Chinese sailors were swept overboard from
the steamer Stanley Dollar of this port during
the Dollar'B passage from Moji to Hongkong.
The weather was not particularly rough. Bay
the people on the Algoa. but th* Dollar was
so deeply laden that the seas made a clean
break across her decks. When the Alcoa left
Hongkong the Stanley Dollar was there on
the dry dock having a new tail shaft and stern
tube Installed.
Mar Have Run Blockade.
The steamship Tacoma. which left Pnget
Scund forty-two days ago, ostensibly for
Shanghai, but in reality, it was generally un
dtrstood. for Vladivostok, was reported yes
terday as having arrived at MoJl. She was
long overdue at Shanghai and some days ago
*iaÂ« placed on the overdue list and quoted for
reinsurance at 20 per cent. It Is now supposed
that she succeeded In running the Japanese
blockade, landed her cargo at Vladivostok and
has called at MoJl for coal.
Completes First Round Trip.
The steamer M F. Plant, which arrived
yesterday from Coos Bay. completed her first
round trip to the northern port. She was
put on the ran in. opposition to the Break
water, but it is not likely that she will make
any reduction in the Breakwater's passenger
patronage, as she is much slower. The Break
water makes the run in nearly half a day
kts time.

ANOTHER ELK GOES
TO CITY OF TUIiARE
Park Board Rules Aeainst Photo-
Krijphine Articles In the Memorial
Museum, Golden Gate Park.
The Park Commissioners at a meet
ing yesterday In the offices of Commis
sioner Dlngree voted to give the public
park In Tulare another male elk. It
was shown that a male elk formerly
given to the city of Tulare had the
misfortune to break Its leg and lose
ltr, life,
A delegation from the Automobile
Club of California invited the Park
Commissioners to a goods roads din
ner at the St. Francis Hotel.
The board opened bids for the
bronze figure for the Washington
Square fountain, designed by Commis
sioner Cummings. There were two
I proposals, one from the Globe Brass
I and Bell Foundry, $1560, and the
other from William T. Garratt & Co.,
$1725. The bid of the Globe Foundry
was accepted. Mr. Cumminga was di
rected to prepare the specifications for
the work of construction.
The board desired that the widest
publicity be given to the statement
that no article In the museum should
bo photographed without the permis
sion of Commissioner Cummings. This
rule is framed in order to encourage
j the lending of rare works of art to the
I museum.
Superintendent McLaren reported
the purchase of four horses at $262 a
head. The board approved the trans
action on the assurance that the ani
mals had been tested to prove their ca
pacity for hard work and had also
! been duly inspected by a veterinary
surgeon.
Commissioners Reuben H. Lloyd,
William J. Dingee, Earl Cummings
and W. H. Metson attended the ses
sion. The president of the commis
sion, A. B. Spreckels, was out of town.

KOTSURU TAKA
NOT A BRIDE
Judge Cook Decides That
Photograph Marriages of
Japanese Are Not Valid
GIVES REASONS FULLY
Girl Is Eemanded Into Cus
tody of Her Guardian Ap
pointed by Another Court
An application for a writ of habeas
corpus by Kinjiro Iki, on behalf of
Kotsuru Iki, his alleged wife, was de
nied by Judge Cook yesterday. The
girl, who is only 15 years of age, was
remanded into the custody of her
guardian, Miss Margaret Lake of. the
Japanese Woman's Home. The point
raised was whether the Japanese
custom of performing a mar
riage ceremony in Japan, where the
male contracting party is represented
by his photograph, is Jegal in this
country. The girl Kotsuru Taka had
been married in this way to Kinjiro
Iki, but when she arrived here she was
taken in charge by Miss Lake, who ob
tained guardianship papers over her
person. Kinjiro Iki thereupon applied
for the writ of habeas corpus to gain
possession of the girl. Judge Cook
said:
Much is said in the brief of the respondent
as to the object of the Japanese Woman's
Home, and also as to the consequences if the
marriage should be held valid. Of course it
is not necessary to say that such matters hava
Ino consideration in this proceeding. The only
question to be determined is whether the mar
riage in question is or is not such a mai
riage as must be recognized under the laws
of this country.
If after a marriage such as this, valid in
Japan (as this marriage has been admitted to
be), the parties had met in that country and
consummated the marriage, it would unques
tionably be one that should be recognized here.
This alleged marriage, however, was never
consummated, and aa marriage is a personal
relation arising out of a civil contract, I do
not consider it such a marriage as can be con
sidered valid in this country. But aside from
this the question has been directly passed
upon by the Federal courts in the case of.
Lum Lim Ying.
The Judge concluded by dismissing
the writ and remanding the girl into the
custody of her guardian. If his de
cision and the decision in the Federal
courts were wrong a writ of habeas
corpus could be applied for before the
Supreme Court to settle the question
there.

Objects to Lighting Pole.
C. D. Salfield, owner of a home at
the corner of Shrader and Page
streets, yesterday applied ; to the Su
perior Court for an injunction to pre
vent the San Francisco Gas and Elec
tric. Company from erecting a pole in
front of his dwelling.- The hole has
already been dug and the pole is there,
ready to be set, up. . The plaintiff al
leges that it is rough, unfinished and
larger than is necessary for. the
stringing of the company's wires. He
a!so declares that the ordinance un
der which the Board of Works has sole
power to permit the erection of poles
is invalid. Salfield also began pro
ceedings in the. Police Court yesterday
against the lighting company, charging
violation of the ordinance governing
the erection of poles. â¢ â¢ . - *

CHANGES RULE FOR REHEARINGS.â
The new rules of the Supreme Court and the
district courts of appeal will go Into effect
, to-day. The most important change other
than the regulating laws recently passed by
the Legislature is in the matter of granting
rehearings. Previously after a decision had
been rendered the defeated litigant could file
a petition for a rehearing, at the same time
citing authorities to support his contentions.
It Is now necessary- for the unsuccessful con
testant to file his petition within twenty days
after Judgment and to serve a copy of the
document on opposing: counsel, .who may make
answer within the succeeding eight days.

to face with an issue which we long ago foretold. At the time
Adams and Monroe concerted with Canning the Monroe doc
the occasion was not grounded in any question of spoliation
ropean nationals or financial irresponsibility. Spain, through
â¢oly Alliance, was seeking the assistance of part of continental
em the recover)' of her American empire. Her colonies had
-oparated from her by successful revolution and each had been
'ecogriized by the L T nited States and Great Britain as a free and
:>endent nation.
The Holy Alliance proposed their reconquest and subjection
uj Spain. Great Britain was then interested in breaking the power
-in and the United States in keeping Europe from gaining any
â¢ -.inner ground in the Western Hemisphere. The purpose of each
served by the same policy, aficl so we declared that any fur
ther spread of European monarchical institutions in this hemisphere
1 be regarded as unfriendly to the United States.
In this declaration the new republics were left in peace to
develop their institutions and to strengthen their position in the
family oi nations. It is history that most of them have made bad
use of their opportunity. They have been torn by internal dissen
sions, have never developed financial stability and are republics in
name only. Their people are poor because property is acquired
<>nly when it has judicial protection. In their poverty they must
have the activities necessary to community life. These are
â¢ortation. manufactures, production, commerce and banks. As
lissointe governments that curse them are essentially predatory
and rob their own citizens when they have anything worth stealing,
:hese enterprises drift into the hands of foreigners, who rely on
â¢ -otection of their home governments. It took these so-called
republics a long time to learn that it was safe also to rob the
nationals of other countries.
Bat when it dawned upon them that, under the Monroe doc
trine, they were safe against any European invasion of their sove
reignty or seizure of their territory, they proceeded to make up for
me. The first ruler among them to revel in robbing his own
people and foreigners with strict impartiality was Guzman Blanco,
the Dictator of Venezuela. Since his day he has had imitators !
in most of those countries. The robbery of foreigners has gone on j
until it has become the governmental scandal and odium of the
world. ]
g as we maintain the Monroe doctrine Europe is powerless, j
Other nations may blockade ports as the concerted powers block-]
aded those of Venezuela, but that accomplishes nothing. They
might land a military force, with our consent, and administer a j
thrashing- to a Latin- American republic, but the finality of
which consists solely in the subjugation of sovereignty and
the taking of territory, is forbidden by the Monroe doctrine, so
That such military punishment would be useless, and indeed, in- |
human. As long as we hold the attitude of protector of their soil j
and sovereignty those countries can safely violate every principle
<<f common honesty and international integrity.
The effect of this immunity upon them is Very bad. It increases ]
Bhonest ways and their sense of irresponsibility. Their;
recklessness is well illustrated by that monkey of the Andes, Castro !
<>f Venezuela. He has violated all of his promises and the arbi- i
us which followed the blockade of .his ports. The United j
g I him out of that trouble and he requites us by despoiling
ens and insulting our Minister.
Now. this situation cannot go on forever. If the Monroe;
me assign to the United States any function, it is that ot '
of the sovereignty and territory of the other nations of
this hemisphere. If that protection is used by them to rob other
â  als and recklessly violate all of the decencies of international
se, we must follow' our protectorate to its logical con
Â« and make them behave themselves, or we must abandon
it and let them take the punishment they have earned. The latter |
se would mean their conquest by Great Britain, France, Ger- |
Italy and the other trovernments they have insulted and j
pie they have robbed. If we feel ourselves strong enough
sept the European monarchies as neighbors and rivals in our
sphere, we can abandon the Monroe doctrine and leave those
as republics to their fate.
[f we don't, every consideration of national decency and honor
hat we use our protectorate to compel them to pay their
and behave themselves. Every one of them would to-day be
1 a prosperous people and would have a full exchequer
had honest and decent jrovernment. By permitting a con
tinual eir evil courses we are doing them a wrofjg. As long
U we permit them to feel perfectly irresponsible for anything they
do. we are encouraging the worst instead of the best government.
We must face the issue. The President has put it plainly in his
iiid it is up to the Senate to vitalize the Monroe doctrine
it.
Just now there is a disposition to antagonize the President,
which we hope will not be projected into this matter. The other
nations of the world have been taught to obey and observe their
international obligations by being made responsible for their vio
lation. ' Be Latin-American republics are riotous, reckless
and irresponsible, and they are made so by the Monroe doctrine.
They should have sound financial systems, based on the currency of
â¢he world. But they have not. because under the Monroe doctrine
they feel no responsibility. As we deny to Europe the right to
hold them to responsibility, unless we do it ourselves we are in
the position of the officer of the law who protects its violation.
No sane man believes otherwise than that they will speedily
reform, acquire stable governments and thrive, from the time that
the United States tell* them they must or we will make them. We
have protected revolution, thriftlessness and dishonesty among
them to our shame. Now it is time for a change. The President
selects the worst of them to begin on, and if the Senate carry out
the will of the American people by indorsing the President's pro
posed course in that country, we will proceed with Venezuela,
Guatemala and the other half barbarotis and wholly dishonest gov
ernments, and by compelling them to respect the rights of the rest
of the world will make them respect themselves.
THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
TO-MORROW The Sunday Call will publish the second and
concluding 1 installment of the unfinished novel by the late
Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Reaconsfield, a work which has
aroused the keenest interest in literary circles in England, and a
rl: which will undoubtedly take rank as one of the greatest of
ihiUOOM literary fragments. It is published just as Disraeli left
in the midst of an unfinished paragraph after he had made a
.nning on his tenth chapter.
The prize story for the week is by Louis J. Stellman of Los
Angeles and is entitled "Wilfred Jansen, Private." It is a cleverly
U story of campaigning against the Tagalos in the Philippines,
and is the best of the many Philippine stories that have been sub
mitted in the contest. Charles Dryden in "On and Off the Bread
Wagon" brings his widely traveled and widely abused hero to San
Francisco, where he sojourns for a few days, subsisting chiefly upon
one dozen pears purchased from a street vender, a class that seems
to have been as prevalent a decade ago as it is now. In "Chimmie
Fadden," the Bowery philosopher discourses upon the life of foreign
Embassadors and reveals certain grave secrets of diplomacy. Opie
Read continues his series, "The Jottings of Old Lira Jucklfn," with
a discussion on war and prayer.
There are two pages for women. Augusta Prescott writes a
page upon "Tea Gowns and Negligees," and Madge Moore has a
cage upon "Silk Underwear."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1905
CHARMING LILLIAN RUSSELL IN A NEW ROLE,
THAT OF A PHILOSOPHER.
LILLIAN RUSSELL* Interviewed
in the Theater Magazine for Feb
ruary, says she has often won
dered what it would be to be
without beauty. She said in part:
"One would miss beauty, I suppose;
but the tragedy would be to have
some dreadful accident, to lose a leg,
for instance, and never be able to go
about or to work again. I often think
of that. If that happened to me I
should kill myself. But why specu
| late?" she added. And with this the
secret of the smooth brow, the child
like mouth, the beautiful, nerveless
body, the eternal youth, was revealed.
"I never think of yesterday nor of
to-morrow. To-day is enough. I
don't make any plans for the future.
I never have. Perhaps I am some
thing of a fatalist. I always think,
'If I make such a plan and it doesn't
work out well I shall be disappointed,
so I won't make it.' It is much better,
I think, to be governed by present
conditions and do what at the time
seems best. Is it not written: 'Do not
worry about tiie future. Tou will
meet it if need be with the same rea
son that you now employ In your
present affairs.' "
"Marcus Aurelius?" queried the In
terviewer.
Miss Russell nodded.
"He is my constant companion,"
she said. "I have all of the twelve
little books in my room."
"And Epictetus?"
The diva pursed her lips as a
schoolgirl does when her task is hard
ly tolerable.
"Not so much," she said. "Epicte
tus was lame and poor and unfortun
ate, and what he wrote reflected those
conditions. But Marcus Aurelius was
noble, and that nobleness seemed only
the natural unfolding of his life. He
looked upon everything that happened
as a part of the development that we
call life." /
And she quoted further from the
Roman Emperor philosopher:
"Accept the gifts of fortune without
pride and part with them without re
luctance."
"I think," said Miss Russell, "that I
could lose whatever I have to-morrow
and not grieve for it. It would seem to
me to be the working out of natural
law."
And again she quoted the Stoic phil
osopher. The words were strangely in
congruous upon the lips of this vital
beauty, but she pointed an earnest,
convincing finger as she spoke: "Act,
speak and think as one who knows
that he can at any time depart from
life."
The subject of economy was
broached. Miss Russell is understood
to be an advocate of economy. She
was putting on a big, black velvet hat,
a somber frame for a perfect face,
while she talked.
"Yes, girls should save money," she
said. "The girl who earns $25 a week
should save $10. When she earns $50,
she should save $25." She put her hat
on as French women do, drawing it up
from the back of the head first, poising
it daintily at last on top of her head
and turning slowly before the tripli
cate mirror to see that it was so placed
that it was equally becoming at all
angles.
BANK'S CARE OF CENTS.
A simple illustration will show the
care that in taken of cents by the First
National Bank of Chicago. Stamped
postal cards are not used, and not one
of the thousands of routine letters that
are written every day is stamped or
sealed until the whole routine mail of
the day is assembled in the afternoon.
Then all the cards and letters to one
correspondent are put in a single en
velope and â except for letters from the
officers and the likeâ the bank comes
as near as possible to getting its en
tire mail carried at two cents an ounce,
or a cent for every postal card, instead
of often paying 2 cents for a quarter
of an ounce, as it would have to do if
every communication were sealed and
stamped separately. This little matter
of getting full value out of a 2-cent
stamp makes a saving of from $25 to
$30 a day.â The World's Work.
Case of Lese Majeste?
There is great indignation in the
court circles of Berlin because the Bur
gomaster of Lubeck â one ot the free
cities of Germany â has submitted a
communication from his City Council
which says that, "owing to several
large building projects on hand, the
city does not care to set aside any
place for a monument to Emperor Wil
liam I."

LATEST PORTRAIT OF LILLIAN RUSSELL.
"She should, but I am reasonably
sure she won't," she added with
charming inconsequence. "The first
$50 I saved I spent for a watch. It
wasn't a very good watch. It was
afraid of working too hard, and would
only go part of the time. But it was a
watch. Then I began saving again,
and this time I bought a sealskin
sacque. My third pile of savings went
for a pair of turquoise earrings, set
with diamonds.
LISTENING TO MUSIC.
People often get intensely excited in
listening to musicâ letting their emo
tions run rampant and suffering in
consequence a painful reaction of fa
tigue. If they would learn to yield so
that the music could pass over their
nerves as it passes over the strings of
a musical instrument, and then, with
the new life and vigor derived from the
enjoyment, would turn to some useful
work, they would find a great expan
sion in the enjoyment of the music as
well as a new pleasure in their work.
If we enjoy good music and gloat over
our personal pleasure in it, so to speak,
it takes the life out of us. If we let
the music carry us along instead of
trying, in our excitement, to carry the
music, it brings new life to us. â Annie
Payson Call, in Leslie's Monthly.
The Humming of Wires.
Herr Bock, of Babenhausen, Ger
many, has been carrying on observa
tions of the humming, both of tele
graph and telephone wire?. The hum
ming of wires running east and west
is said to presage a fall of tempera
ture, often 10 or more hours in ad
vance of the thermometer; the hum
ming of wires north and south advises
a rise in temperature, almost always
several hours in advance of the ther
mometer.
FULL OF RUBBER.
Wiggsâ Send for a doctor. My neck
pains me terribly.
Waggs â Don't send for a doctor; get
my friend Potts. He's a gardener and
an expert on rubber plants.
"What should a girl do with her sav
ings? Live on it during the summer
when she is not earning anything.
When she has saved enough, she would
do well to invest in real estate in town.
New York real estate isn't bad. I have
never lost money in that. But I never
made a cent on Wall street, nor on the
races. I have won, but I have lost,
too, and at the end of the season the
story is always the same; I am not
ahead a dollar."
POINT OF VIEW.
Senator Penrose says that a friend of
his residing in Wilkesbarre recently en
gaged as nurse a Scotch girl just come
to this country.
It appears that one Sunday the lady
induced the nurse, who is the strictest
sort of Presbyterian, to attend a beau
tiful church just erected in Wilkes
barre.
When the girl returned her mistress
asked nor if she had not found the
church a fine one.
"Yes, ma'am," responded the girl, "it
is very beautiful."
"And the singing," said the lady,
"wasn't that lovely?"
"Oh, yes," replied the nurse, "it was
very lovely, ma'am, but don't you
think it's an awful way to spend the
Sabbath?"â February Lippincott's.

THE COMMITTEE
OF SELECTION
HARRISON SMITH
SCRIVENER rounded thÂ« corner
and made hia way leisurely
through the afternoon crowd
that thronged the sidewalk on
i the sunny side of the street. Some
yards ahead he caught sight of a blue
hat with a distinctive feather. He
quickened his steps with a mind singly
bent on overtaking it. But the blue
hat was in a hurry: it dodged this way
and that with amazing dexterity and
npt until the pursuit had progressed
several blocks was he able to lay a â¢
detaining hand on Molly Stanton's
shoulder.
'â¢Oh, I say," he protested.
She turned. "Oh, it's you, Mr.
Scrivener," she said with a smile that
vas ample recompense for the chase.
"I should keep in training for such
emergencies as these," Scrivener
panted.
She laughed. "I was making pretty
good time," she admitted, "but you
see, I'm weighed down with responsi
bility, and I want to free myself of
the load as soon as possible."
"Yes?" said Scrivener questioningly.
"I'm appointed by Donald a com
mittee of one to select a valentine.
H(- has a terrible affair of the heart.
It's the little girl next door."
"Dear, dear," said Scrivener grave
ly. "This is a serious matter. Any
restrictions imposed on the selection?"
"It mustn't cost more than 18 cents
â he made that amount yesterday run
ning errands for the cook â and it must
have a heart on it," she explained.
"Ha! The difficulties multiply,"
said Scrivener darkly.
"I'd like your help in the matter,
if you're not too busy," she said.
"Were you going anywhere in par
ticular?"
"I was going up to the club for
lunch," he said. "I wasn't really cer
tain I wanted lunch. Now I*m silre
I don't."
"We'll make it a committee of two,
then, if you don't mind," she re
marked.
"Delighted," he said heartily.
They made a merry round in quest
j of the requisite valentine.
In the first shop they entered Scrir
ener pointed out the fact that all the
decent valentines cost more than 18
o nts; in the second, those that came
within the stipulated price were deck-.
Ed with hearts far too inconspicuous,
and in the third, the hearts were much
too large and of the wrong shade of
red.
Scrivener suggested they try a lit
tle place well uptown, where he felt
certain they could find what they
â wanted; so they took a car uptown,
only to find the little shop quite sold
out. This â to Scrivener's unbounded
satisfaction â meant they must take
the long car ride downtown again.
"I think you must want that lunch
by this time," she said as they took
the downtown car.
"If I thought of lunch at such a
critical moment as this, I should con
sider myself false to Donald's inter
ests," he replied Ingenuously.
Finally they found a valentine that
ccst 17 cents, and, as Miss Stanton.
said with an uneasy glance at her
watch, "would pass muster."
Scrivener expressed his doubts on
this point, and suggested that they
| look farther, but even he had to admit
j that the heart, pasted gorgeously in
one corner, was of the right size and
color.
When they came on to the street
j again it was growing dark. Miss
Stanton held out her hand.
"I'm awfully sorry to have delayed
your lunch in this fashion, but I think
it will taste all the better because of
the good deeds you have done this
afternoon, she said.
Scrivener looked at her thought
fully.
"If It wasn't so late," he said "I'd
like to ask a favor of you."
"It's never too late to ask favors"
â¢ she commented gayly.
"I'm intending to send a valentine
myself, he said. "I'd be very grate
ful If you'd help me choose itâ give
me a few tips about it. you know "

AT LAWLOR
Angrily Protests Against
Ti;vin<r Case Involving the
.Election Commissioners
WARM WORDS IN COURT
Presiding Judge Pleads His
Calendar Is Crowded, but
Assigns Cause to Himself
The judicial . dignity of Presiding {
J udge Lawlor received a shock yes- !
tcrday morning when Judge Dunne!
faced him on the bench and in an ex- i
cited manner and angry voice objected !
to the assignment to his court of the
case of the Election Commissioners
charged tilth misfeasance In office. A
case was being tried at the time and
the courtroom was crowded. The re
monstrances of Judge Dunne became
so frequent and so loud that Judge
Lawlor took a recess for a few min
utes and requested his colleague to
ttep into his chambers. Judge Dunne
tarried his point and Lawlor reas
signed the case to himself.
The case was originally before Judge
ILawlor. After considerable argument
on a demurrer interposed by the de
fendants on the ground that the cita
tion should have been Issued in the
r.ame of the people, the Judge held
that the point was well taken and or
dered a new citation issued in that
form. This was done and the defend
ants were ordered to appear In court
yesterday.
When the case was called yesterday j
the defendants and their attorneys, T. j
V. Cator and H. W. Johnson, were
IÂ»resent, besides Attorney John A. Hos
nier, special counsel for the prosecu
tion. Judge Lawlor said he had as
signed the case to Judge Dunne ow
ing to the congested condition of his
own calendar. The attorneys and de
fendants went to Judge Dunne's court
and Cator explained the reason for
their presence. Dunne expressed his
surprise, as Lawlor was familiar with
the facts. He asked Assistant District
Attorney Whiting to see Judge Lawlor
and request an explanation. Whiting
returned and informed Dunne that the
case had been assigned to him owing
to the congested state of Lawlor's cal
endar.
MAKI-!S ANGRY PROTESTS.
Judge Dunne took a reces6 for a few
.â t-s and hurried to Judge Lawlor's
< urt. Taking a seat beside Lawlor,
he was heard to protest against the
case being assigned to him. Such ex
aa "'Whaj^ do you mean by

tinctly heard. "You are not treating

an attitude." and then he took a re

"Am a matter of courtesy to the pre

LAWLOR REASSIGNS.

"Go away and don't bother me. May-
be coffee la causing all my alls, but I
just don't pee how I can give it up."
That Is the pitiful wall of a despair-
ins; coffee slave and yet there Is an
easy and sure way out of the slavery.
"I knew coffee was the cause of all
my trouble," confesses an Indianapolis
woman, "but I just couldn't give it up.
I used to try, but every time went
back to coffee, until finally my nerv-
ous syEtem wag in such condition that
a single cup of coffee was sufficient to
throw me into a state bordering' on
hysterics. I had generally two terrific
pick headaches every week and was
eimply a wreck of nerves.
"Finally I was Induced to try Pos- 1
turn, but at the first trial it was so
thin and weak I knew something must
be The matter, so I read the directions
over again and found it is not made
like coffee, but must have 15 minutes
at least for steady boiling. So I
tried again and the result was a deep,
rich -colored, perfectly delicious drink
that weaned me from my coffee with-
out any regrets.
"The Postum took coffee's place bo
completely that before we realized it
â¢ue â 4 forgotten coffee ever existed
and ail the time I was improving rap-
Idly from the very time I began the
Postum.
"To put it briefly the Improvement
continued until I am again a well wo-
man.
"Although 1 drank the Postum and
got co well, my husband couldn't be
induced to drink It, for he thought I
was one of the people coffee hurt and
he wasn't. But about six weeks ago
he had an attack of kidney trouble and
first thing the doctor told him was to
<juit coffee. Then for the first time he
tasted the â Mum and he was sur-
prised and delighted. He has drank It
ever since and his attack of kidney
trouble Is gone and this morning he
made â me feel proud by saying, the
ToKtum was the best coffee he ever
drank. Now all of our children drink
it. too.
"I make our morning Postum on
the after-supper fire the night before
<nnd a â¢ :ht boiling in the morning
bj-ins.s it to perfection and in this way
it takes no longer to make in the morn-
jr;pr than coffee did. It doesn't taste
Fiale like coffee does, the flavor is
really Improved." Name given by Pos-

MUSIC HALL BELLES AT WAR
DANSEUSE 15 ATTACKED
DUMPY CONTRALTO AND WILLOWY
SOPRANO ASSAULT CLOG ARTISTE
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
"Thp i-de-ah!" tittered Miss Trixie
8011, .ontraltu balladist, glancing at
Miw Kva Dimples, soprano serio-com
ic. "The ver-ray i-de-ah!" tittered Miss
Eva Dimples, returning Miss Trixie
Bell's glance. Then the two artistes
tittered in unison.
They stood side by side before Police
Judge Mopan and pleaded that they
had received from Mlfs Alice Wain
wright, clog and soft-shoe dancer,
provocation more than ample to justify
their laceration of that lady's nose one j
night last week at Jackson and Kearay i
streets. There was marked physical
difference between Miss Bell and Miss
Dimples, the former being squat of fig
ure and pectorally prominent, while
her companion, attired In a tight-flt
ting, double-breasted coat, looked
every inch a Gibson girl, even to the fa
cial punctures that probably prompted
her adoption of "Dimples" as a stage
; sobriquet. When she â which
'â  she frequently didâ her cheeks seemed
' to roll inward at the middle. Miss Bell,
Son the other hand, only allowed her
naturally austere features to relax
when she tittered, "The 1-de-ah!" in
response to the Judge's query as to
whether professional Jealousy had
prompted the waylaying of Miss Wain
wright.
"Why, how could we be jealous of
j her?" dimpled the taller lady, "when
we are vocalists and she is a dancer?"
; "Prom her statement to this court,"
I said his Honor, "It appeared that when
{ she made her debut at the North End
Music Hall, in which you artistes were
employed, your envy was aroused by
j the fact that she won more applause
; than either of you received, and that
you deliberately attacked her In the
playhouse and afterward while she and
her husband, Mr. Truesdell, were going
to their home."
Miss Dimples ejaculated "Mer-cy!"
and Miss Bell saturninely muttered,
"The gall of her."
Patrolman Nelson, who had arrest
ed Miss Wainwright and her spouse
and subsequently scooped in the Misses
Bell and Dimples, took a hand in the
interrogation by asking Miss Dimples
if it were not true that she and Miss
Bell had been restrained by their man
| ager from assailing Miss Wainwright
as she was leaving the theater, that the
Impresario found It 'necessary to im
prison them In his office until after
the new star had departed, and that
when they were released they immedi-
I ately followed and beat her.
"She didn't tell you that she kicked
1 me in the ribs, did she?" was the ir
: relevant answer of Miss Dimples, de
; livered unsmilingly.
"Or that she kicked me in the eye?"
' Miss Bell solemnly inquired.
"Bring all the parties here to-mor
'. row morning," said the Judge to the
officer.

W. A. Fant, who blackened his wife's
| eyes and tried to stab her with a table
i knife, got six months for battery from
Judge Conlan, who ordered that a
: charge of attempt to murder also be
, entered against the defendant.
Mrs. Fant and her spouse had been
j separated and she was earning a live
lihood by managing a lodging-house
at 441 Tehama street, when he visited
her and Insinuated that she was on
more familiar terms with one of her
male lodgers than her position war
ranted. When she denied the impeach
ment he planted his fist" between > her
eyes and then picked up a table knife
and lunged at her so fiercely that the
i weapon was broken by colliding with
; a corset steel. A lodger named Ed
'â  McKean disarmed the Infuriated man
; and the police and Judge Conlan did
I the rest.

i Prosecuting Attorney Hanley on being

Hanley said that thank goodness and

i Ayala was hardly less difficult than

were alleged to be Anglicized, when,
i in fact, they might as well be Choc
1 taweÃe so far as the , intelligibility of

Bast Nickel, a peddler of . chestnuts
; who was arrested for refusing to keep
' his horse and wagon In motion, spoke
; a lingo that his counsel, Mr. Splnnetti,
] could not entirely understand, bo a
Grecian gentleman named Frank was
called to interpret. He. too, was
; stumped by the defendant's , language
and called to his. aid a compatriot
, whom he addressed as George.- For
a while it looked as If George would
be Inadequate to fill the lingual breach,
j but after a brief and animated " re
hearsal with the defendant he an
' nounced that he could derive enough
1 from the latter's patois, accompanied
by illustrative gestures, to convey to
Frank, who could convey to the attor
ney, who could convey to the court, ,
what the defense was. So the , plea
; of Mr. Nickel was Jabbered and wfg
1 wagged to George, to Frank, to Judge |
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALTJ, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1905.
Mopan, who thus ascertained that Mr.
Nickel has been in the United States
only three weeks and that he came
from an obscure isle of the archipelago
! that once was enlivened by the twang
ing of Homer's lyre and the song of
burning Sappho. Case dismissed.

"I may be a boozer, but I ain't no
I bum," said Michael Murphy, accused
before Judge Cabaniss of having so
licited alms from pedestrians on
Kearny street. His Honor glanced
severely at Mr. Murphy's unprepos
sessing ensemble and inquired:
"What are you trying to do â per
petrate a parody on the song which j
says 'I may be â be â be â what may I
be. Barney?' "
" 'You may be bughouse, but you
ain't no nifty.' " promptly responded
Clerk Bernard Conlan.
"Ha, ha! Nonsense," laughed Bailiff
Neil Carmichael. "The song goes, 'I
may be foolish, but I ain't no idiot.' "
From the attorneys' table came the
information that both quotations were
incorrect and that to the best of the
speaker's remembrance and belief the
popular words were, "ifmay be nutty,
but I ain't got no wheels." Then the
defendant himself enlightened the
court by humming, "I may be crazy,
but I ain't no fool."
"But I ain't tryin' to parody nuth
in'" he added. "Wot I wants yer Hon
or ter understand is that I hit up th*
booze, but don't bum th' price o' it.
I earns me money cleanln' fish an' I
spends it like a gentleman, an* w'en
it's all gone I goes ter work an' makes
more. That's all there's to it. If yer
Honor wants ter send a workln' man
ter jail, all right; but I don't believe
ye'd do such a thing as that."
Mr. Murphy's outlook was promis
ing fair until Patrolman George Col
lins ascended the witness stand and
pronounced him a first water vagrant,
who neither hesitated to beg nor to
hurl foul words at persons who de-
clined to encourage his vagabondage.
Then he was given forty-eight hours
and reminded that It would be dis
creet for him to celebrate his release
from jail by departing the town.

Policemen Nelll and Field, on plain
clothes duty to detect violators of the
anti-pool selling ordinance, testified
that betting on horse races was cov
ertly carried on in the fruit and vege
table store of Joseph Rinaldi, 1105
Scott street, near Turk, and that they
had found evidence of the same in the
shape of "overnight entries" and other
literature pertaining to the speed
track concealed in Mr. Rinaldi's stock
in trade. It was his wont, they said,
to propose to persons who sought to
purchase vegetables that they invest
in a bet on one of the current day's
contests at Emeryville, thereby plac
ing temptation and facilities to gam
ble within the reach of housewives
who might not otherwise have either
inclination or opportunity to flirt with
the fickle goddess. Judge Mogan will
hear Slgnor Rinaldi's defense next
Friday.

Frank Smith, accused of vagrancy,
and designated "an old coast ranger"
by Patrolman Nelson, tried to embar
rass that energetic policeman by in

said, "Come along with me and I'll
show you our new Chief." The po

With reckless disregard of the or
dinance that prohibits the payment of
money instead of merchandise to per
sons who play nlckel-in-the-slot ma
chines, K. Yakahama, formerly of
Japan, openly rewarded with cash
those compatriots of bis who beat an
automatio game of chance In his store
on Stockton street, near Clay. Patrol
man Mills, who was In plain attire
when he visited the place, averred
before Judge Mogan that little brown
men were falling over eaoh other In
their eagerness to deposit nickels In
the device, which consisted of a cir
cular plate like a dock faoe, with
colors substituted for numerals. Each
time a winning was made Yakahama
permitted the lucky Investor to scoop
up and retain the nickels that trickled
from an orifice in the machine, thus,
in the officer's opinion, virtually pay
ing cash and violating the law.
Judge Mogan has given himself un
til February 27 to digest this case
with several others of like character
that recently came out of the Asiatic
quarter. The children of Mongol seem
to be either Ignorant or heedless of
the fact that by a remarkable process
of reasoning the municipal lawmakers
have pronounced it legal to lose either
liquor or cigars by means of a slot
machine and a misdemeanor to pay
cash equivalent of such losings or any
cash whatever.

SENDS BULLET
THROUGH BRAIN
F. L. Moore, a Los Angeles
Business Man, Takes His
Life in Ferry Building
FAILS TO LEAVE NOTE
President of Western Com
mercial Company's Rash
Act Shrouded in Mystery
The sharp report of a pistol in the
i ferry depot about noon yesterday dis
i turbed the busy throngs of men and
women as they passed hurriedly on
their way. A moment later the almost
lifeless body of F. I* Moore, a promi
nent business man of Los Angeles, was
found lying face downward in a lava
tory of the waiting room on the second
floor. He died on the way to the Har
bor Hospital.
A SS-caliber bullet had crashed
through his right temple. The weapon
was found tightly clutched In Moore's
right hand. No note was found.
Moore came to this city several days
ago on business, and it is thought that
financial carea prompted him to seek
death.
Moore was president of the West
ern Commercial Company of Lob An
geles, and a man of note. He was
about 40 years old, tall, broad shoul
dered and of handsome appearance.
Several emblems of the Knights Temp
lar were found on his person, indicat
ing that he was a member in high
standing.
Several canceled checks aggregating
more than $2000 were discovered in the
Inner pocket o-f Moore's coat. One was
for $1200 for the payment of a note
on the Farmers' Bank of Los Angeles.
Two others for $500 each on the same
bank were also for the settlement of
debt. Besides, there were checks for
â¢mailer amounts on various banks of
the southern city.
Joseph Bibesta, 635 Folsom street,
heard the shot, and he notified Patrol
man Van Kuren of the Harbor Station.
The officer rang for an ambulance, but
Moore died on the way to the hospital.
The body was removed to the Morgue
and a telegram was sent to Los An
geles.
Moore had evidently planned the tak
ing of his life, for the piÃtol which he
used was evidently purchased a few
days ago. A box containing forty-five
cartridges was found in the coat pocket
of the dead man.
Moore came here with his wife about
three weeks ago and registered at the
Sevenoaks Hotel on Sutter street. He
was known to be in straitened financial
circumstances. His wife Is prostrated
by the sad news of her husband's rash
act. The dead man's son will arrive |
in this city to-day. The body is at an |
undertaking parlor on Van Ness aye- j
nue and will probably be shipped to
Los Angeles for burial.
WELL KNOWN CITIZEN.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17.â Frank
L. Moore (not Gus), who com
mitted suicide in San Francisco to-day,
had for fifteen years been a well
known figure In the wholesale district
of Los Angeles and as president of the
Western Commercial Company he had
amassed a fortune. He was a man
who paid strict attention to business,
attracted but little attention to him
self and was one of those conservative
men whose opinion was asked on most
Important business matters and who
was considered a substantial citizen.
He had never been prominent before
the public, although the extent of his
interests was such that he was well
known to the Los Angeles business
world. His credit was without limit
and he was interested in a number of*
enterprises other than that to which
he devoted all of his time.
HEALTH HAD FAILED.
Two months ago his place of busi
ness was destroyed by fire, along with
several other large stores on North
Los Angeles Btreet, but the loss was
well covered by lnurance. The strenu
ous efforts which Moore put forth after
the fire to catch up for the lost time
which had caused his business to suf
fer brought him to the verge of nerv
ous prostration, and a month ago he
was obliged to cease all work and
place himself under the care of a phy
sician. He did not improve In health
and a trip to Honolulu was decided
upon. With his wife he left Los An
geles three weeks ago for San Fran
cisco and since then only occasional
letters had been received from him. To
his associates in the company the news
of his suicide caused no surprise, be
cause he is said to have threatened his
life unless his health improved. He j
was not a prominent Knight Templar, j
in fact was not a member of the local '
commandery, but only of the Blue
Lodge. The body will be brought here
for burial.
Repertoire Announced.
The repertoire of operas to be sung i
during the first week of the English ',
grand opera festival at the Columbia
has just been definitely announced in
a message received from Manager
Henry "W. Bavage. The season will
open with Mr. Savage's elaborate pro
duotfon of Verdi's "Othello" on Mon- '
day night, February 27, the opera be- i
Ing repeated Thursday night ant at |
the Saturday matinee. Bizet's "Car- i
men" Is to be sung on Tuesday and
Thursday nights and the following
Sunday night and Wagner's "Lohen- ',
grin" will have the performances on j
Wednesday and Saturday nights.
Opera festival seats will be plaoed on
sale Thursday, February 28. No an- !
nouncement of casts has yet been i
given out, but it is understood there i
will be an opportunity to hear all the
leading principals in their favmorlte
roles.
To Make College Hill Passable.
Works Commissioner Aigeltlnger
yesterday arranged with General
Manager Chapman of the United Rail
roads to have College Hill filled with
red rock, so as to make it passable
from its top down to Islais Creek.
Chapman agreed to furnish the city
three cars and all the red rock for
the work free of charge. Arrange
ment was also made to have somp
prisoners in the County Jail lay the
rock on the slope.
HE RECEIVES TWO BLACK EYES.
Mr. John Smart, wishing to Im
prove his physical condition and Inci
dentally to please his fiancee, takes

WITTMAN WANTS
AN EARLY TRIAL
Announces He Will Be Ready
When Case Is Called and
Will Not Ask for Delay
HIS FRIENDS AT WORK
Are Said to Be Trying to
Exert Influence on Com
mission in His Behalf
Chief of Police Wlttman is not with
out friends in his present predicament
of being suspended under charges of
neglect of dÂ»ty and incompetency.
They are exerting themselves energeti
cally in his behalf, with a view to
abating any hostility that may be
working against him to oust him from
office.
The Commissioners assure the Chief
that he shall have a fair trial and that
their decision will be based on the evi
dence adduced. Though the purpose to
depose Wittman appears to be strong,
the members of the board assert that
they will not act unjustly.
George Boyne, secretary to the Com
missioners, did not prepare the com
plaint against the Chief yesterday, but
he had a conference with Commission
ers Poheim and Reagan in regard to
formulating the accusation.
Wlttman called on the secretary yes
terday and asked If the charges were
ready for service. He wanted them so j
his attorney oould get to work. Boyne
promised to have them prepared to
day. .
"The earliest date on which the trial
can be held is a week from to-night," :
explained Secretary Boyne.
"Well. I shall be ready to go to trial
at that time and shall ask for no con
tinuance at any time," said the sus
pended Chief.
Wlttman called during the morning
on Acting Chief Spillane and found a
cordial reception. The honors of the I
high station fall gracefully on the vet- j
eran captain. "Captain Norman and
Sergeant Fitzpatrick, the clerks in the
office, steer me straight In my duties," j
he explained.
MAESTRETOT SITS WITH BOARD.
Only a Spectator at Session In Which
Business of Minor Importance
Is Transacted.
Public Works Commissioner Frank
A. Maestrettl oocupied a seat beside
the Police Commissioners at their reg- j
ular meeting last night.
"No, I am not a candidate for Chief
of Police and am not familiarizing
myself with the Police Department's |
affairs," he explained after adjourn- !
ment. ' I "I have troubles enough as a
Public Works Commissioner and to
become Chief of Police would be like
jumping from the frying pan into the
fire. I just dropped in as an in
terested spectator."
, The Commissioners revoked the
license of John A. Plant for a saloon
at 904 Illinois street. Frequenting of
the place by a rough element was the
cause. A number of minor matters
were disposed of. . <

MATERIAL IS FINE
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 17.
S â  ver before ha 6 spring athletics at
' rd begun ac early as they did
year and never was there a more
â¢ >sy proppect Tor future Cardinal vie-
I than there is at th ; time. It is
â no early to Judge what the real
gth of the Stanford forces will be,
:n every department of athletics,
r., baseball, tennis and rowing,
are many likoly candidates with
X form the trainers and coaches
I ore than pleased. Strict training
rules have no longer to be insisted on
at Stanford, the men themselves re
garding it a dishonor to indulge in any
c forbidden pastimes. This spirit
.pinp more than anything else to
make the Cardinal teams successful.
Track prospects are rosy. When last
>earf track team broke up and the
realization came that Dole, world's
champion pole vaulter; Dunn, the great
linal sprinter; Hoiman, winner of
.he mile and the half-mile in last
â¢ - rcollegiate meet; Hyde, the
â  i man, in all, forty points of win
rinps, could never run for the Cardinal
again because they had participated
for four years, Trainer Moulton shook
his head sorrowfully. "We can never
replace them," he said. But when the
veteran trainer looked at the likely
men the freshman class brought with
it to Stanford this year he quickly
chanped his mind. Dole is replaced by
Lanagan, a Denver youngster, brother
â¢c football coach, who has made
the remarkable record of eleven feet
ihree inches this early in the season.
Davis. Freeman and Elwell all promise
rint nearly as fast ,as did the
:> Dunn. Miller seems even better
than Hoiman in the distances. Last
Saturday, on a track that looked like
an oval pond, this freshman covered
the half-mile in the remarkable time of
â¢r.inutes and six seconds. In the
he is equally fast. Horton, who
from Uklah. is the new man
with thp weights. He has already put
the sh [ forty-two feet, has ' high
jumped five feet six inches and is run
the hurdles in championship
These freshmen, with their
; and Gartzmann, are ex
pected to win half the points Stanford
makes in the field meet with Califor
nia. For the other half there is Lana
gan, the hurdler; Weller, hurdler and
jumper; Macfarland. hurdler; Bell,
track captain and jumper; Whitaker
pole vaulter, and Crawford, hammer
thrower, all of whom have won points
in former intercollegiate meete.
Four veterans are all Stanford has
left of las: . nrg baseball team. These
men are Captain Trowbridge. short
stop; Sales, pitcher; Colbert, first base,
and Chalmers, left field. There are,'
Â« er. a large number of last year's
<d team men to draw on and a few
freshmen. BO Coach Cowden feels con
fident he will be able to develop a
stronger team this year than Charlie
did iast. Hitting seems to be the
feature of the Cardinal team,
tting practice is overcoming

shed the hail continually, yet the
next tin,, that they were called on to

BERKELEY; Feb. 17.â The eyes of
the athletic contingent of the Uni
versiiy of California are turned toward
Stanford to see what the rival univer
sity will do in the matter of ratify
ing the agreement to drop the old re- ,
striction limiting the college football
elevens to a choice of coaches among
graduates of the universities. If Stan
ford ratines its representatives' action,
taken when the men from the two in
stitutions met in San Francisco several
weeks ago, and in thus doing follows
the example of the" University of Call
fornia, the work of securing a cracka- ''
KJack coach will be begun at once.
As the practice teams of the varsity
baseball team are played interest in
the club's chances increases, there be
ing a noticeable addition at each game
to the number of spectators on the
bleachers. The fact that the varsity
has met defeat in all of the prelimi
nary games has been a bit staggering,
but Coach Williams explains that he
is not trying so much to win games
now. with the pick-up teams that are
opposed to the varsity, as he is en
oring to develop material from
the veterans and new men. that can
be welded Into a flrÂ»t-class champion

CRICKETERS GET
RESPONSE FROM
FAR AUSTRALIA
On December 5 of last year a letter i
Mas sent to Major Wardill of Mcl- j
bourne, Australia, by Arthur Inkersley, I
secretary of the California Cricket |
Association, expressing v hope that the j
Australian eleven of 1905, if it passed
through San Francisco, would play a
match against an eighteen or twenty
two of California. The letter was pub
lished in full in the Melbourne Argus.
A reply dated January 4 has been re
ceived from Frank Layer, who is the
manager of the Australian eleven now
on Its way from the Antipodes to Eng
land. It reads as follows:
MELBOURNE. Australia. Jan. 4. 1905.â T0
'the Honorable Secretary of the California
Cricket Ansociation, San Franc is-'.'oâ Dear Sir:
Tours of the sth of December was handed to
me this morning by Major Wardlll and la
reply I wish to state that the team of Aus
tralian cricketers for 1005 will not be passing
through San Francisco. We go through Can
ada to England; so we are unfortunately not
abie to arrange a game with you. Personally
I should have liked to have seen San Fran
cisco once more. Youra faithfully,
FRANK LAYER.
Manager Australian Eleven for 1905.
The Australian eleven Is a strong one,
containing men of high reputation. It
includes Victor Trumper, generally
considered the greatest batsman in the
world. In 1902, while in England with
the Australian team, he scored 2670
runs, including 12 "centuries," his aver
age being 45.49. R. A. Duff has a sound
defense, and is a consistent scorer. M.
A. Noble is an extremely cautious bats
man and stays long at the wickets. S.
E. Gregory is not so brilliant as hÂ«
was, but possesses great skill and long
experience. A. R. Gehrs of South
Australia has an easy, graceful style,
and is regarded as the most promising
batsman on the continent. He played
successfully against the English team
captained by P. F. Warner, which
brought back the "ashes" to the old
country. Newland is a new man, a
good batsman and a trusty wicket
keeper. The regular wicket keeper will
be the veteran J. J. Kelly. J. Darling
is a fine batsman and an excellent cap
tain of an eleven.
The Australian bowlers are Noble,
Hopkins, Howell, McLeod, Cottar and
Armstrong, with Trumper if needed.
Noble Is a medium-paced, right-arm
bowler, a* also are Howell, Hopkins
and McLeod. Noble has a great deal
of artifice. Cottar is said to be the fast
est white bowler In the world, a
Queensland aboriginal being the fast
est. Cottar is difficult to play even on
a true wicket, but when helped by the
condition of the pitch is almost irre
sistible. The Australian newspapers,
which are critical of cricketers, state
that each fielder is perfect In his po
sition, dashing in to meet the ball in
stead of waiting for It to reach him.
Lou Dillon (1:55^.), queen of the trot
ting turf. Is holding regal court these
crisp February days at Agricultural
Park, San Jose, where willing hands
minister to her wants and watch her
practically every minute of the twenty
four hours to Fee no harm befalls her.
The admirers of the light harness
horse the world over will be pleased to
learn that the peerless Lou is regain
ing the form she showed in Memphis in
October, 1903, when, as a five-year-old,
she accomplished the feat of trotting
a mile faster than two minutes. This
was a feat the theorists had shown to
their satisfaction could not be accom
plished, and its achievement by the lit
tle California mare electrified the j
world.
The great mare is in the master
hands of Budd Doble, and she shows in
every move the benefits of his intelli- I
gent care. The silken sheen of her coat,
the complexion of the horse, denotes
the rudest of rude health. She is gain
ing in weight steadily, having increas
ed from 850 pounds, which the scales
indicated four weeks ago, to more than.
i.OO pounds. Mr. Doble is anxious to
put on every possible ounce of flesh,
as it will mean just so much material I
on which to work later on when the
seriaus preparation begins for record
trials.
It is all holiday with this capricious
queen at the present time. She has her
first feed of oats at 6 o'clock. The mak
ing of her toilet commences about S
o'clock and continues until nearly 1L
During this time she Is polished and
manicured until her coat is like bur
nished gold and her hoofs are spotless.
If the weather is favorable she is then
hooked to a road cart and driven on
the road by Mr. Doble at a walk or
a Jog for from two to three hours. This
steady driving is causing her to forget
the track, and she is losing all the
nervousness which she developed last
year.
Lou Dillon in her stall and the same
animal in harness are as different as
the poles. In the former she is quiet
and her ears have a way of flapping
about which gives her a plain appear
ance. The instant the harness la put
on she is transformed. She then has
all the airs and graces of a show horse
and is as notional as a prima donna.
Mr. Doble is ever on the alert when
driving her, but never fights h*r. He
is using a plain bit, heavily covered
with rubber and with his light hands |
there is never any strain on her mouth, j
She is absolutely fearless of auto
mobiles and bicycles, while the on
ward rush of the interurban cars has
no terrors for her. She has a healthy
appetite for her midday feed. After
her siesta she is led out where succu
lent grasses, which put those of the
blue grass country to shame, grow
luxuriously. She nibbles at the dainty j
morsels and enjoys the air and the I
eunshine. There is another feed at j
6 o'clock and at 9 o'clock she retires
for the night Her blankets are '
YOUNG HOUNDS
OF PROMISE IN
A PUPPY STAKE
The first of the Interstate Coursing
Club's big events will be run at Union
Park next week, when the Belle Bran
don cup will be up for decision. This
is for young greyhounds. In conjunc
tion with this stake will be run the
California Plate, which attracts an
nually the fleetest of the dogs in train
ing.
All the kennels have a number of
puppies from which to select and there
are some wide guesses as to the num
ber of nominations. These estimates
place the entries from thirty-two to
fifty-four. The progeny of Roman
Athlete will start for the first time
in the Belle Brandon and much Is ex
pected of them. They are big, rangy
puppies and they have shown con
siderable class In private try-outs.
Among the greyhounds brought
here by D. K. Carter of Cottonwood
Falls, Kans., Is the imported dog
Patched Up, which was a notable con
tender In the American Waterloo last
fall.
A large number of hares were re
heavier than those she wears In the
daytime and she has plenty of room
in which to stretch herself.
Her 6tall has a southern exposure
and she gets her share of the sun
which shines genially over the pic
turesque Santa Clara Valley. She
shares her stall with Ed Molloy, her
groom, who has been down the grand
circuit these thirty years with the
light harness horses. The stall is deco
rated with lace curtains and with tab
lets indicating to all visitors the per
formances which have made her
famous. Conspicuous among the deco
rations is a large thermometer, which
is studied carefully that no violent
changes of temperature come to the
hothouse flower which is guarded so
jealously.
Twice a day the queen smacks her
lips over what her caretaker laconic
ally calls her "tonic." This is simply
good old fashioned cod liver oil and
it seems to agree with her highness.
C. K. O. Billings, her proud owner,
tp expected on a visit to this coast
shortly and it would not take an ex
pert on solving puzzles to guess where
he will first pay fiis respects.
At present Lou is being given only
sufficient exercise to keep her in health.
In due time Mr. Doble will send her
along and will put her in rough form
for the campaign in the East. It is
not known to what track nor to what
trainer her owner will send her when
the time comes for serious training
work.
LADIES STRIVE
IN FOURSOMES
Presidio Golfers to Visit
Claremont to Play Second
Half of Match.
On Tuesday morning, the 21st inst.,
the members of the Women's Annex of
the San Francisco Golf and Country
Club will hold foursomes over eighteen
holes, medal play, on the Presidio
course. Among those who are likely
to take part are: Mrs. J. R. Clark. Mrs.
K. Giiman Brown, Miss Ives, Miss Car
rol!, Mrs. Leroy Nickel and Mrs. W. G.
Miller.
On Washington's birthday the men of
the San Francisco Golf and Country
Club will hold a handicap tournament
over eighteen holes, medal play. There
will also be competitions for members
of the San Rafael Golf Club and the j
Claremont Country Club.
Next Saturday the representatives
of the San Francisco Golf and Country
Club will journey over to Rockridge
Park to play the second half of the
first home-and-home match in the in
terclub tournament. The Claremont
team is seven points to the good on the
first eighteen holes, which were played
over the Presidio course on Staurday,
the 11th inst. In previous tournaments
the San Francisco players have nearly
always secured a considerable lead on
the Presidio course, so that, as it may
be presumed that the Claremont men
are more familiar with the new course
than the visitors from San Francisco,
the odds are in favor of Claremont tak
ing the first match. Captain J. R.
Clark of the San Francisco team and
Captain W. P. Johnson of the Clare
mont twelve will exchange lists next
Friday.
Though the Claremont Country Club
course is to be an eighteen-hole one,
only the first nine holes are ready for
play. The distances of these holes are
celved from Oregon on â  Thursday, so
that the parks will be able to complete
I their cards on Sunday. The running
j of the reserve stake at Union Park will
I commence to-morrow upon the arrival
'of the > 10:1 a. m. train. The likely

TOURNAMENT PLAY
ENGAGES MANY OF
THE TENNIS MEN
Alameda Games Will
Attract Numbers
of Experts.
WOMEN IN ACTION
If inclement weather does not upset
the plans of the tennis players there
will be an abundance of tournament
grmes in the next few days. There
will be two events on the public courts
to-day, another on the Alameda courts
on Sunday and Wednesday, while on
the last named day there will be a
tcurney at the California Club.
The events scheduled for to-day
are the completion of the boys' handi
cap sinDle for the Reed and Barton
cup and a handicap singles tourna
ment for ladies of the third class. The
lstter event will be for tbÂ« Miller t up,
| whU'h has been competed for twice
and has been won as many times hy
Miss Bessie Cully. She will be oall*M
upon to give larger handicaps th
the past and will probably find th-^
th'rd and final victory a hard one to
achieve.
In the boys' tournament, which â  I
commenced last Saturday, eleven pl;i.
ers are left in the competition. FivÂ»
have won places in the third roun<l
and six players will compete for th*
other three places. In the second
round R. Keigel (15 l-6> vs. H. M
Lane (owe 3-6 >. M. McLoughlin (â¢Â«â¢
30) vs. V. Butler (scratch) and K.
Garcia (15 3-6) vs. M. Morris (3-6)
will be the matches played this morn
ing.
In the third round G. Maundrell
(15 1-6) will meet F. Maggo (3-6); W.
Marcus (1-6) will meet R. Strachan
(owe 15); H. Lang (owe 4-6) will
meet the winner of the Reigel-McLa:- â 
match. The winners of the match'-*
between McLoughlin and Butler and
Garcia and Morris will come together.
The handicap singles tournament,
which has been in progress at the park
for several weeks, was completed to
the semi-finals last Sunday. The four
players who will come together-
George Baker, C. Howell, H. Gabriel
and A. Brabaut. Baker, who :
best man in the tournament, has nor
lost a set. and. despite the heavy odds
he will have to allow, is expected hv
a majority to win first honors. Ha
will have to allow Howell odds <>?
"owe 15 3-6" and give "3-6." Howell
has been playing good tennis and
should make a good showing with
such a liberal handicap.
The other semi-rinal match will be
between Gabriel and Brabaut. The
former will receive owe odds of "3-*. "
The handicap does not amount to
much, but should enable Gabriel la
win. He is a clever youngster and the
decisive way in which he disposed of
Hotchkiss last Sunday caused quite a
surprise to some. Brabaut and Hotch
kiss are about equally skillful and it
young Gabriel can keep his nerve hÂ«
should win.
The anual tournament for the Ala
meda County championship will com
mence to-morrow and will be com
pleted on Wednesday. The present
champions are George * Baker in
singles and J. D. MacGavin and R. R.
Variel in doubles. Baker will be In
bcth tournaments and stands an exc-1
lent chance to annex both events. HÂ»
will play with his brother, Neil, in the
dcubles.
There is some doubt as to whether
Percy Murdock will compete. He will
probably play, but has had but little
practice in the last two or thr^e
months. The tournament would bÂ«
much more interesting with Murdoclc
in it. Biker holds all the other play
ers safely and unless Murdock playÂ«i
should win easily. Janes, Long.
Critfin and Foley will make it inter
esting for him, but are not conceded
much chance to win the champion
ship. The doubles event has a much
more open look. Long and Janes,
Long and Gardner and Foley and Dun
lap will make the Baker brothers play

RING CONTEST
CASEY IS DEFEATED
BY BOXER BERGER
IN DECISIVE STYLE
RIGHT TO JAW
DECIDES BOUT
Berber Fights Better Than
Ever Before, Displaying
Both Skill and Agility
CASEY PROVES A FROST
Former Coalhearer Swings
Wildly and Shows He Is
Far From Being a Champ
It took Bam Berber a little more than
a minute and a half to stow the much
touted Jim Casey away last nigrht at
Woodward's Pavilion. A snappy right
to the Jaw started the Irishman to the
land of grogglneeÃ, a couple of lefts
helped the rood work along and finally
a stiff rlrht to the point sent Casey to
the carpet a beaten maa.
Beryer was a popular man when he
stepped out of the ring. He had man
aÂ«ed to redeem his lost laurels and the
ehowlng he made impressed the spec
tators. Casey never had a chance and
landed only a few slight taps on the
former Olympian. The Irishman was
wild, while Berber was cool and col
lected, fighting the best battle of his
career while the affair lasted.
When the men stepped to the middle
of the ring Berger led with his left
and had little trouble in reaching the
heaver's jaw. Thi6 was kept up
for half a minute, with Casey making
an occasional wild rush and trying to
land swings that Invariably missed
their mark by many feet.
Berger waded in and kept the good
work up. Casey made one sudden rush
and managed to reaoh Berber's kid
neys with a right that resounded all
<>ver the house. This seemed to en
thuse the Irishman, for he again start
ed to be aggressive, while Berger
watched his even* movement and was
ready for him.
CASEY RI'SHES BERGER.
Casey' made a rush at Berger and as
they were about to close in on a clinch
the latter brought up a jolty right that
landed flush on the jaw of Casey. He
dropped like a log and remained down
seven seconds. When he arose he was
groggy and did not seem to know what
was doing. Bergrer was ready for him,
dancing around and putting his left
to the head.
Casey was practically helpless and
Berger followed him around the ring.
When he saw his chance the former
winged "O" boxer stepped Into his an- I
tagonist and brought a stiff right over :
on the jaw. Casey went down and his '
head hit the mat with a thud. He was
out for fair and it took his seconds sev
eral minutes to restore him. â
When Berger left the ring he was sa
luted with the cheers of the multitude.
He had managed to bring victory home
after several failures and was once
again an idol, for the time being at I
least. The spectators ere not im- â 
vressed by the showing of Casey and '
extended several hearty invitations to ;
him to resume work on the front, take |
<< the coal heap once again and try to ,
forget that he was once a prize fighter. j
Berger's blows were short and jolty. |
but the effect was there. He managed j
to keep cool and fought a scientific
fight. Casey had absolutely no class
and showed he has no license to figure
in a prize ring. He aroused the suspi
cions of the spectators before the bat
tle by announcing he was not in as
good form as he would like to be.
ATTENDANCE IS ENORMOUS.
The fight drew a full houseâ one of
the biggest, in fact, T.hat was ever
packed into Woodward's Pavilion. It
was the main event of the San Fran
cisco Club's monthly show. Alex
Greggains as usual officiated as referee
in all the contests.
The next bout of importance to the
main event was the mill betweei. Ah
Wing, the Celestial champ, and Billy
Bannon, announced as the pride of the '
South Side. The little Chink showed :
he is a fighter by going after his man '
in the flnst round and flooring him five
or six times. Bannon got v little bet
ter as the fight progressed, but Wing
was there all the time, leading with
his left In true American form and
bringing the right over when he had a
chance. He was unanimously declared
The winner. â 
Leo March and Fred Lang, two un
couth and < unschooled heavies, fur
nished the "comedy bout that might
have been termed tragic for the
amount of blood spilled. Lang was
declared the winner, because he knew
just a wee bit more about the game
than March, who was absolutely igno
rant of ring tactics. March bled pro
fusely, so badly in fact that both
he and his opponent and referee Greg
gains were red from gore from tip to
toe.
SULLIVAN' â  CLEVER.
Dick Sullivan, a clever welter, was
the surprise of the night. He easily
outfought the hard hitting Harry Riley
and showed he Is a comer. George Ellis
received a hair line verdict over Charlie
Dunn, Denny O'Connell finished Jim
Bradley in three rounds and Harry Mr-
Cloud knocked out Joe O'Neill in half
a round-
Jimmy Britt was introduced and
made a* speech to the effect that he
is willing to fighUwhen the proper time
arrives. Megaphone Joe Copeland an

fact of the benefit ball game to be j

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL. SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 18,. 1905.
ANDREW B. COOK CAPTURES THE HANDICAP,
BEATING RECTOR AID ROCKAWAY
BUCOLIC IS HEAVILY PLAYED
AND MINDER LANDS HIM FIRST
Princess Wheeler
Defeats Field of
Maidens.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Rockaway, from the stable of W. B.
Jennings, did not shine to any particu
lar advantage in the six-furlong handi
cap yesterday at Oakland. Possibly
the chestnut horse does not care for
muddy going. At any rate he enjoyed
first call in the betting and finished
third.
Andrew B. Cook, the fast but un
lucky bush champion, piloted by Frank
Otis, earned the biggest slice of the
$500 purse. Rated to the far turn, he
vas gradually forced into the leading
position, and at the wire defeated Rec
tor with something in reserve. Ven
et >r had speed, but faded away to
n< thing in the run home.
The major portion of the fields had
.n open look and picking winners was
difficult. The only successful favor
ites were Bucolic and Fair Lady Anna.
PRINCESS WHEELER SCORES.
Princess Wheeler from the stable of
W. B. Jennings, took the opening sprint
from a big field. Her price in the bet
ting was slashed from 6 to 4 and with
Knapp up, the filly won all the way.
Celeres, a newcomer from up Sacra
mento way, beat Phalanx out for place
honors. Indicate swerved badly in tha
stretch, ruining whatever chance he
possessed.
Backed from 5 down to 2 to 1 fa
\oritism. Bucolic, with Minder in the
saddle, captured the five and a half
furlong run. Everybody seemed to
know that the preceding race of the
gelding was a "bloomer" and went to
the track prepared to unload. It
proved a good thing, for Minder had
him in front from start to finish. Two
15 to 1 shots, Dandie Belle and Salto,
fought it out for the place, which the
former obtained. Sir Dougal faded
away the last furlong.
Success attended the second essay
of Fair Lady Anna, the Figaro Stable's
entry, in the second five and a half
furlong dash. The mare ruled a 2 to 1
favorite and in a long, hard drive
Jakie Jones landed her first at the
wire, half a length before Bath Beach.
Profitable came on from last place,
running a close third. Stumbling near
the padduck when second, Bard .Burns
was put out of business.
SUBURBAN QUEEN IN FRONT.
"Big Bill" Knapp, astride Maxtress,
favorite for the mile selling number,
succeeded in getting lost altogether in
the discard. The mare showed in third
position for half the route, then she
began falling back. Harry Michaels,
on Suburban Queen, a 5 to 1 chance,
had his mount jn front the entire dls
iance and, riding a strong finish, re
ceived a neck decision over Glenarvon.
a 10 to 1 shot. Play Ball led out Se
curity for the show.
A ragged assortment of platers
started in the closing mile and a lur
long selling affair, with Trapsetter
clopinpr a slight favorite. It was flg
uivd that little Graham was too light
to handle Barney Dreyfus, and instead
of going to the post favorite, 5 to 1
wap laid against Dick De Neffe's bay
gelding. Barney not only had speed,
but took the lead from Budd Wade
and, at the wire, heat the latter with
apparent ease. Erne finished third.
Little Barrett did everything but fall
off Trapsetter.
I^ANAGAX AGAIN' SELECTED
TO COACH STANFORD MEN
Signs a Contract to Handle the Foot
ball and Baseball Trams for
Three Years.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 17.
James F. Lanagan, head coach for
the Stanford football squad, signed a
contract to-day with Athletic Manager
It. W. Barrett to remain at Stanford
for the next throe years as head coach
of both the football and the baseball
teams. Lanagan's salary for this work
â will be $2000 a year and expenses for
a trip to the large Eastern univer
sities each year, In order that he may
study football as it is played at Har
vard, Yale, . Princeton and Pennsyl
vania. Lanagan graduated from Stan
ford in 1900 and has since been an in
structor at Belmont Military School.
His development of the Stanford foot
ball team during the past two years
has been so remarkable that his re
tention was deemed advisable.
From present indications It seems
liktly the new athletic agreement re
cently adopted by the intercollegiate
athletic committee and which proposes
to abolish the graduate coach system
in football at Stanford and at the Uni
versity'of California will he ratified by
the Stanford executive committee at
its meeting to-morrow night. Presi
dent David Starr Jordan favors the
retention of graduate coaches at both
universities, but it is unlikely that he
will Interfere if the students ratify the
inent. In an interview this aft
ernoon Dr. Jordan said: "I am unal
terably opposed to the employment of
professional coaches in football. I
prefer to see the intercollegiate foot
ball game dropped rather than return
to the conditions that existed at Stan
ford and California a few years ago,
when outsiders were hired to win
games. There are two classes of pro
t.ssi.mal coaches; the one is a profes
sional pure and simple, as a prize
fighter, whilo the other has the inter
est of the university as well as the
winning of the game at heart. In case
the first sort of coach is employed
either at Stanford or California I will
interfere and there will be no inter
collegiate football games played on the
Stanford campus, but if the coach
comes from the second class of men I
do not know that I will Interfere. The
purpose of football is not to organize
a team to win regardless of other con
siderations. Its function is that of
honorable sport in which decent men
do the best they can for their college
colors, do it decently, and let it go at
that."

NELSON STILL
OVER WEIGHT
Dane Finds It Difficult to
Get Down to the 130-Pound
Mark for Coming Fight
CORBETT'S GREAT FORM
Little Demerit* 1 Seems in
Condition to Fight Any
One at a Moment's Notice
Battling Nelson is still grinding away
at his training quarters at Larkspur,
trying to get beneath the 140-pound
mark. The Battler in former sieges of
training has always reduced with lit
tle difficulty to the required weight,
but on this occasion the problem of
making 130 pounds is beginning to have
a serious look. Instead of reducing,
he seems to gain in weight, and harsh
measures have had to be adopted in
order to get off the surplus flesh.
The Dane donned two heavy suits
of flannels anÂ«l four heavy sweaters
yesterday morning and jogged about
twelve miles on the road. This stren
uous method of reducing, however, fail
ed to perform its work. In the after
noon Bat spent an hour in the gym
nasium punching the bag, skipping the
rope, tossing the medicine ball and
wrestling. A couple of fast rounds
each with Rawhide Kelly and Fred
Landers completed the day's work.
Billy Nolan, Nelson's manager, has
sent for a professional rubber, who
will arrive at the camp to-day, p:\ery
effort will be made to reduce the Dane's
weight considerably within the next
few days.
A large crowd of sporting men visit
ed Billy Shannon's villa yesterday in
trder to see k'oung Corbrtt work fur
his coming battle with Nelson. Cor
bett spent more than an hour in the
gymnasium going through his usual
paces, and his many admirers, who
have not had the pleasure of seeini;
him perform lately, were surprised at
his condition. The little fellow is as
fast as a bullet and does his work with
* will. Those present were treated to
an eight-round bout with Joe Gans.
The pair went at it as though their
lives were at stake, and many a sting
ing blow was given and taken. In the
morning Corbett went eight miles on
thetroad and returned looking as fresh
as a daisy. A brisk, rubdown followed
Frank McDonald, Corbett'a trainer,
says his protege is in the best possible
condition and could go into the ring at
a moment's notice.
FIRE COMMISSIONERS
TRY THREE COMPLAINTS
31 embers of ; the Department Up On
â , Charges Are Cautioned and
Fined.
Yesterday's proceedings of the Fire
Commissioners were devoted chiefly, to
the trial of W. H. Leonhardt and
Charles Lieter, both of Engine - 21,
charged by Battalion Chief Conlon
with fighting in the quarters of the
company.
The trouble took place on February
11, as the result of the throwing or a
shoe at Leter as he lay in bed. Leter
accused Leonhardt of throwng the
shoe. Before the board the men ac
cused each other of starting the fight.
The Commissioners took the matter
under advisement. Transfer will fol
low any further trouble.
George E. Dunn of Engine 30 was
accused by Captain Danahy of Insub
ordination. He did not deny the
statement of his captain and' was fined
six days' pay.
John McCluskey of Relief Engine 1.
accused by Captain Michael Boden of
intoxication, was fined fifteen days'
pay.
"Eddie" Graney appeared before the
board yesterday to explain the alleged
shoeing of Chief Shaughnessy's horse
twice within nine days. He convinced
the Commissioners that there were
two horses, one a relief horse, of which
the department superintendent did not
make :. a : note .on the bill. The claim
v.as allowed.
CANOEISTS ARK ACTIVE.
Oakland Organization KleÂ«ts Officers
and I*repares for Coining Season.
All the boating clubs having quar
ters on Sessions' Basin, East Oakland,
recently received formal notice to give
up their clubhouses, the land c-n which
they stand being required for manufac
turing purposes. It seems likely now,
however, that the only club that will
be disturbed for some time is the Co
lumbia Rowing Club, which has al
ready been deprived of access to the
creek by piling driven in front of its
landing fkrat. This organization has
taken no active part in rearattas or
other rowing events for several years
and its members have so nearly aban- J
doned the recreation of rowing that it
is likely the club will be disbanded.
The Oakland Canoe Club will remain
undisturbed for a season or two at
least and has offered the University nt
California Boating Association permis
sion to put its clubhouse next to the
Canoe Club quarters and use its float
If the present site of the Berkeley
boathouse becomes untenable.
The annual meeting of the Oakland
Canoe Club wag well attended and re
sulted in the election of the following
officers for 1905: Charles Stewart,
commodore; F. B. Bain, vice commo
dore; Frank Paul, secretary and treas
\ urer; S. A. Hackett and R. B. Bain Jr.,
committee on membership. The com
modore was appointed a committee of
I one to consider the plan of selecting a
1 new site for the club's quarters. The
: prospects of the club for an active and
pleasant season are good.

American League Refuses
to Raise the Ante When
Drafting Minor Players
COMPROMISE PROPOSED
.lohusoii OflVrs to Patch
Matter Ip, but Smaller
Clubs Will Not Accept
NEW YORK. Feb. 17â American
League of Baseball Clubs to-day re
jected the amendment proposed by thÂ«
National Association, an organization
of minor league clubs, providing for an
increase In payments by the two major
leagues for players drafted from team*
in the minor leagues. Under the old
agreement the major leagues paid $750
for players drafted from class A
leagues; $300 from class B; $300 from
class C, and $200 from class D, al
though an unlimited number could be
drafted at the price named 'from the
other classes.
The National Association proposed an
amendment providing for a new class â
class AA. The price for a drafted
player from this class was to be fixed
at $1500, for class A $1000, class B $750,
class C $600 and class D $400. The pro
posed amendment provided that only
one player should be drafted from class
AA and that an unlimited number
should be drafted from the other
classes at the prices named.
Howard Griffiths of Jersey City, rep
resenting the national board of thÂ»
National Association, submitted to the
National League to-day the proposed
amendment and received the league's
answer through President Johnson that
the league refused to concur.
COMPROMISE IS PROPOSED.
President Johnson proposed this
compromise: That the drafting price
be $1000 for class AA and A, $750 for j
class Band $500 for class C and all
other classes. The proposed compro
mise involved an agreement that only
two men should be drafted from either
class AA. class A or class B or any
other classes.
Griffiths, who had the power to act
for the National Association, declined
to accept the compromise. Johnson then
said that the American League would
agree to act under his proposed com
promise scale of prices for one year,
and then, if the experiment was not
satisfactory, pay the prices proposed
by the amendment. Griffiths, in behalf
of the National Association, flatly de
clined to accept the proposition.
A joint committee on rules of the ,
two major leagues met to-day and re
adopted the 190-1 'rules. Absolutely no
change was made. The foul strike rule
was discussed, but the Joint commit
tee was unanimous in its opinion that
the rule, should stand. j,
WORLD'S CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES.
The conditions for the world's cham
pionship series of games between the
respective winners of the National and
American leagues were made known
to-day. There will be seven games, the
location of the first three to be decided
by lot. The deciding game will be
played in a neutral city to be desig
nated by the National Commission.
Each club must deposit a forfeit, the
amount to be fixed by the National
Commission. The two umpires to of
ficiate at the games are to be appoint
ed by the respective presidents of the
two leagues.
Of the gross "proceeds the National
Commission will retain 10 per cent for
expenses. Forty Der cent of the bal
ance of the gross receipts of the first
four games will be set aside as a pool
for the players. The clubs will get the
remainder, 60 per cent. Seventy-five
per cent of the pool will go to the win
ners and 25 per cent to the losers. The
receipts of the other games are to be
divided between the clubs. The teams
will play for a special pennant ami '
each member of the winning team will
receive an emblem. r
At the American League meeting this
afternoon it was decided to enforce
more strictly the balk rule and to en
force the rule for level pitchers' boxes.

HEAVY SNOWS
CHECK TRADE
Unfavorable Weather Delays
Traffic and Effect Is
Felt Throughout Country
CONFIDENCE IN FUTURE
Preparations Continue Un
abated for the Business of
the Spring and Summer
NEW TORK, Feb. 17.â Dun's weekly
review of trade to-morrow will say:
Weather conditions still dominate the trade
situation. Deep snows have interfered with
traffic throughout the country. There ii a
partial offset in the largely Increased demand
for heavy-weight wearing apparel and other
winter goods, which promises to reduce sup
plies in all positions at the end of the season.
Meanwhile there Is evidence that confidence In
the future remains unshaken, preparations for
spring; and summer trade continuing- unabated
except where fuel or other supplies are tem
porarily blockaded In transit.
Railway earnings thus far reported for
February are 1.9 per cent smaller than a year
ago, probably another result of the bad weath
er. Commerce at this port for this week made
a remarkable record for Imports, exceeding: in
value those of last year. Exports decreased
$1.504,888.
Accumulation of packers' hides caused a
fractional decline in price, but the market Is
not actually lower. Fine dry hides are scarce
and firm.
Failures this week were 258 la the United
States, against 287 last year and 42 In Oanada,
oompared with 20 a year ago.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:
Cold, stormy weather, the most severe and |
widely distributed in some respects of the win- 1
ter, has had a depressing effect on trade at j
wholesale and retail and has stopped railroad
transportation In some sections and interfered ]
with various lines of Industry heretofore ac- j
tlve.
The Southwest and South have suffered se
verely, and the East and Northeast have felt
the effect in only a slighter degree. The re- :
suit is a curtailment of the activities of sales
men over a wide area, which, taken In con-
Junction with the occurrence of a holiday in :
many States, has reduced the week's trade to 1
very small proportions.
Despite this drawback, however, some favor
able features come to light upon examination. !
The steel situation Is, If anything, rather j
stronger. Railway earnings for January, '
though reflecting stormy weather and grain
rate troubles, show a gain of 6 per cent. This, !
however, compares with a decrease of 8.8 per
cent In the same month a year ago.
An encouraging feature In the dry goods
trade at the East Is the increased Inquiry for |
cotton goods for export to China and other 1
countries. There is more ease In the market
for foreign raw wools.
Failures for the week number 243, against â¢
207 last week and 231 in the like week In j
1904. In Canada failures for the week number !
17. against 26 last week and 23 In this week ]
a year ago.
Wheat, including flour, exports for the week I
ending February 16 are 556.540 bushels, !
against 589,775 last wpfk and 1,657,510 this
week last year. From July 1 to date the ex- !
ports are 41.581.488 bushels, against 104,766,- j
109 laÂ»t year.
CHICAGOANS HEI.D TP
IN THEIR OWN OFFICE
Fired Upon by Highwaymen and
Forced to Give Yp Bight Hun
dred Dollars.
CHICAGO, Feb. 17.â Twelve men
were held up #ast night by six armed
robbers In the office of Max Mllden
berg, proprietor of the Electric Light,
Oil and Gasoline Delivery Company.
The highwaymen fired several shots
as they entered, wounding two persons.
They knocked another unconscious
with a blow from a revolver. They
then took more than $800 and escaped.
While two of the robbers kept the
victims in subjection the other four
took the clerk into the inner office and
ordered him to open the safe. He
complied and they removed the con
tents, amounting to $800.
SUBWAY AND ELEVATED
MAY FACE BIG STRIKE
Employes Meet and ' Decide Upon
Sweeping Demands to Be Made
on Company.
NEW YORK, Feb. 17.â After a pro- :
tracted meeting behind closed doors, at
which 1000 employes of the Interbor
ough Rapid Transit Company were
present, it has been determined to
again make sweeping demands on the
management of the road, failure to
grant which, it was declared by some
of those present, would result in a
general strike on the Interborough
system, both subway and elevated, on ,
March 1.

A brokers" wire from New York yesterday
said: '"If we do not have an increase in the
movement it is a fine purchase, as each week
finds the movement tailing materially, both in
this and that of last year. While the local
condition la still bearish and heavily short
of the market, we still think cotton should
be bought or. any so:t spots as long as the
actual stuff can not be purchased within half
a cent of prices. at which It is selling here."

New York Stock Market.
NCVV YORK, Feb. I".â dimensions of
the market diminished to-day to some extent. '
both in the volume of the transactions and
in the eize of the fluctuations. A number of
the less prominent stocks moved widely, but
the mass of securities which usually make up
tilt market were sluggish. Union Pacific re
asserted itp IÂ«i6>rÂ«hi|> In the market and the
strength which it developed served to hold
prices elsewhere after a rather distinct sagging ,
ttrdency had become manifest. The early
movement upward was fairly general, although
it lacked the- lately prevalent demand for
London account, operations for that center
shifting to the telling side to-day. The move
ment was generally attributed to a covering
up of short contract* put out late yesterday,
largely under the apprehension that the dis- >
pute in the Equitable Life Assurance Society
would j>TtÂ»ve incapable of being healed. . The
policy of -reconciliation which prevailed at
ytrterday afternoon's meeting of the directors '
was hailed with decided relief In Wall street.
where a considerable but vague dread was felt
oi" the ulterior consequences of the quarrel.
This influence in stocks was short-lived, but
it wae followed by the lively upward move
ment In a number of industrial stocks which
a-- rarely conspicuous in the market. News
to account for the movements was not forth
coming, but they were quite generally at
tributed to conditions in the particular trade
with which the properties were connected and :
to a growth in earnings giving rise to sup
positions of dividend benefit* to be either be
gun or increased. Movements in this class
of. stocks are not of strong sympathetic effect
on the general list and they spent their force
rt-ther quickly, to be succeeded by reactions.
The --point rise in Union Pacific to a new
high level was of more effect and arrested
the downward tendency In price*. The large
size of the individual blocks of this stock
which were dealt in- were testimony to the
large resources enjoyed by the operators in
It. The movement bad its customary ac
companiment In Northern Securities on the
cv rb The latter stock, on a volume of trad-
Ir.r unusually, large in the curb market, rose
buoyantly several points above its previous
â¢ record price to the neighborhood of 160.
Great Northern preferred on the Stock Ex
change jumped 10 points on very light deal
lrgs. Further deep cuts In the rates on grain
for export had a disturbing effect on senti
ment and witnessed to the growing serious
ness of the war for that traffic. A talk of
a strike of 'the New Haven firemen was also
of some effect. The forecast of the week's
currency movement gav# promise of a weak
bank statement - and the -rate for call money
ruled slightly higher in consequence. The
regular movement with the interior Is still
slightly in favor of New York. With thÂ«
late reaction In Union Pacific prices elsewhere
fell back again and the closing was heavy.
Bonds were firm. Total sales, par value,

CHICAGO BOARD OP TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 17. â The wheat market was
weak from the start. - With the â  opening of
trade a large line of long wheat was placed '
on sale. The Idea was general that the offer
ings were made for the account of a leader of
the. bull crowd. In consequence initial quota
tions showed wide fluctuations. May being off.
%c to l%c at $1 20 to $1 21. July waa down
%@%c to Vi@%c at $101% Ito $102. While
shorts and commission houses were liberal pur- '
chasers, offerings were of such magnitude as to
cause a still further recession. in prices. Be
fore the end of the first : hour May I had sold
off to $1 189i@l 18% and July to JJI 01%. Esti
mates of the quantity of. long wheat disposed
of while the selling pressure lasted put the
amount in the neighborhood of 5,000,000 bush
els. While the general marKet was influenced
mainly by the action of the May delivery,- thÂ«
extreme weakness was due in part to the bear
ish news. Receipts in the Northwest to-day,
were larger than for the corresponding day |
1 lust week or a year ago. Total primary re
ceipts were only a trifle less than last year.
The market was extremely nervous the entire
session. May rallied materially on covering by
iOiorts, but distant' deliveries were Inclined to
i drag. At the close the market was weak, with
I May at $110% and July at $1 01%. .
Influenced by â  the slump in wheat, the , com
j market was subjected to heavy selling pre*-.
' sure, several prominent longs being 'active on
i that side of the market. May closed at 46% c.
OitÃ were steady at a decline. from the pre
vloug close.' May closed at ale. .
Provisions were a trifle easier as a result
of increased rates of live hogs. - At the close
May pork and ribs were each off 2Â»4@5c and

for cheap Butter is better than that for fancy

show an advance. Cheap Butter Is reported in

LAW'S TENANT
WILL NOT MOVE
Millionaire Having Trouble
AYith Occupant of Premises
in the Monadnock Block
Millionaire Herbert E. Law has dis
covered that he has an undesirable
tenant in his Market-street property
who is likely to be still there when the
new Monadnock building replaces the 1
one now in course of demolition, unless
the owner compromises a suit that was
filed yesterday by William Glynn.
Several months ago Glynn rented a
small frontage in the Bishop building
from Law and opened a cigar stand on
the premises. When Dr. Law recently
decided to replace the old structure
with a new one and awarded to the
American-Hawaiian Engineering and
Construction Company a contract for
removing the old pile of brick, it de
volved upon Law to give his tenants a
thirty days' notice of his intentions in
order to permit them to move.
Unfortunately Glynn was overlooked
in the service of these notices that are
required by law. Ignorant of this fact,
the contractors several days ago began j
to demolish the cigar stand over its '
protesting owner's head. The top and j
sides of the stand and a portion of its |
floor and of the advertising signs on |
the outside had been ,torn away and a j
board barricade placdd in front of the ;
premises before it was discovered that
a serious error had been committed.
Attempts to pacify Glynn at that stage
of the proceedings proved futile. He
refused to budge and has finally gone
to the courts to compel the contracting j
firm, as Dr. Law's agents,' to reim
burse him for the damages done him,
setting the latter at $4750. Of this
amount Glynn, In his suit, claims $1500
for property destroyed and the balance j
for injury to his retail business.
Under the law a landlord is liable for
three times the amount of the judg
ment awarded in a case where it is
shown that he has interfered with the
business of a tenant, and in cases
where the landlord is guilty of having
destroyed the property of a tenant it is
his duty to first place the property in
the condition he found it before he can
force the occupant of the premises to
vacate. Consequently Glynn, although
hemmed in by boarded barricades and i
doing no business as a result of the en
forced concealment of his cigar stand
from public view, has the upper hand
against Dr. Law. Until the millionaire
sees fit to reconstruct the cigar stand
he will not be in a position legally *to
serve on Glynn a notice to quit, and
the angry cigar vendor declares that
he will never quit until he is lawfully |
compelled to.
Should Glynn carry out this deter
mination the Monadnock building will
have to be built under serious disad
vantages, lor Glynn's present quarters j
are in the center of the Market-street j
frontage and directly in the way of !
completing the exterior portion of the
new structure. It is thought, however,
that Millionaire Law and his tenant
will finally compromise their troubles
and that in a few days what remains
of the objectionable cigar stand will
have been moved to some other quarter
of the city.
BEGINS INVESTIGATION
OF DEFICITS IN FUNDS
Finance Committee Questions Em
ployes of Works Board on Ex
penditures for Paving.
The Supervisors' Finance Commit
tee yesterday began an investigation
into the violation of the one-twelfth
clause of the charter in the expendi
tures made by/the Board of Works out
of the funds for repairs to ballast
pavements and sewer construction,
which have been largely overdrawn as
a result. The committee had received
a report from Expert Cyril Williams
to the effect hat $35,000 had been ex
pended out of the appropriation of
$50,000 for repairs to ballast pave
ments in seven months.
Street Inspector Brandon testified
that from July, 1904, to January, 1905,
there were ten paving crews employed,
consisting of thirty men, who were
paid $115 per day. . Brandon said that
eight â¢ extra teams - were ' employed to
fill in the break at the foot of Fillmore
street . last September, which 'in a
measure accounted for an increase in
the expenditures for 1904-05 as com
pared with; 1903-04. Brandon said
there were four double teams and four
single' teams hired to keep the paving
gangs at ; work and he did not agree
with the commute* that one team v/ould
have been sufficient for two paving
gangs.
P. MaÂ«ee, one, of \ the civil service
pavers, who was let . out when It was
ascertained that there was a deficit in
the fund, was the first witness called
relative- to the inquiry as .to why civil
. service men were dismissed, : although
the teams were retained. Magee said
that a double team would supply two
paving gangs and a single team only
one gang. Brandon ; disagreed with
I Magee, saying that it would take seven
double teams for ten gangs to give
proper service. Magee was also con
tradicted 'by another paver, ;J. ; Lynch,
who said ' that one team could not
serve two gangs. The inquiry ' went
over. .- x ..'- -v- â â¢ â - â / " -,'c
The committee agreed to allow the
Board of Works to expend - $2500 out
of the fund for repairs -to bitumen
pavements to repair the Fourth-street
bridge. Commissioner ; /Aigeltinger
asked the committee to allow an ex
penditure : of $800 to â  rebuild *â  a sewer i
in Harriet street, which at present
backs into the Folsom-street sewer.

SUICIDE WRITES
STORY OF LIFE
Will Loranger Jumps Off a
Ferry-Boat After Penning
History of His Troubles
BLAMES HIS EELATIVES
Tells of How They Tried to
Keep Him in Ignorance
of the Family Secrets
L After writing the story of his life-
I long troubles and addressing it to the
j Chief of Police, Will Loranger, former
' ly of Petaluma, jumped off the ferry
boat Encinal near Goat Island yester
day afternoon. The body sank at once
and could not be found. In the hat was
found a note to the Chief of Police,
saying that the story of his life would
be found in his room, 118 Sixth street.
Loranger left two stories of his life.
They show that he was insane. One
letter was dated February -8, the other
February 15. In a rambling manner, j
the letter tells that the writer was
abused by his family and hounded ;
from place to place till he decided to
seek death.
Loranger lays the blame of his trou
j bles to his deceased father. He also
! criticizes his sister and other members ;
'. erf his family whom he imagined were j
constantly wronging him and seeking j
to keep from him secrets pertaining to j
the history of the family.
He opens his last letter by saying
that when he was but a youth in Peta
luma he was swinging on a gate and \
one of his companions shoved him to â 
the ground, rendering him unconscious, j
The next he remembered he was lying
on a lounge suffering great pain, while \
the members of his family were calm- j
ly eating their dinner. This fact |
seemed to disturb Loranger greatly j
and he said he never forgot it.
He upbraids his folks for keeping !
from from him the history of the life j
of his cousin, Claude Austin, who died ;
| in Montreal, Canada, when he was but j
a youth. Loranger seemed to Imagine
that this qpusin was possessed of much j
affection for him and also had an in- j
teresting history which his folks were
trying to hide from him.
He told of moving from Petaluma i
and going to Santa Rosa, thence to j
Sacramento, where one of his sisters
worked in the Capitol. He showed bit- :
terness against the sister.
The letters were written in a ram- ,
bling way and quoted little incidents in
his life that were of no consequence.
He imagined that the whole world was i
down on him and that the only friends j
he had were always kept away from
him through the influence of his rela- ,
tives.
Captain Hemsworth failed to report j
the suicide for hours. Not only so, but \
he secreted the man's hat and note, j
striving in mistaken zeal to suppress ;
the news.
PETALUMA, Feb. 17. â The only
William Loranger known here left
Petaluma about ten years ago and has
resided with relatives in Sacramento. |
He left here when a mere child and
later: married and got into difficulties
by shooting his wife. His parents
died here years ago and he has a
sister living in Sacramento and one in
Santa Rosa. Little is known of him
here owing to his youth at the time
he left Petaluma.
Camera Club Holds Lecture.
The California Camera Club held
its 177 th lecture last night at the Al
hambra to a crowded house. James
W. Erwin, manager of the San Fran
cisco building at the St. Louis fair,

panied by colored lantern slide views
of the points of interest at the fair.
During the intermission violin solos
given by J. M. Rosencrantz were liber
ally applauded.

SHOWS MERCY
Refuses to Indict Oliver P.
Kellogg, Formerly Post
master at Berkeley Town
REPUTATION SAVES HIM
C. Marchand, Old Man Who
Stole Newspaper From a
Mailbox, Is Given Freedom
Because of the peculiar eircum- |
stances surrounding Oliver P. Kellogg,
formerly 1 Postmaster at Berkeley, at !
the time he used $164 of the Govern- I
ment's money for his own purposes, j
the Federal Grand Jury yesterday re- i
fused to bring in an indictment against 1
him. It was represented to the jurors
that Kellogg's salary was only $50 per
month, that his wife was seriously ill
and that he used the money for the
purpose of paying doctor's bills and '
buying medicines. It was shown also :
that Kellogg had repaid the sum em- j
bezzled and that up to the date of his \
arrest he had always borne an un- j
blemished reputation. Pity swayed j
the hearts of the jurors and they de- j
cided that he had been sufficiently pun- j
ished by the arrest and the subsequent i
publicity.
Sympathy also came to the rescue of !
Constant Marchand, 80 years old, ac- j
cueed of stealing a newspaper from !
the top of a street letter box.

out authority.

ests of good politics. Though Mr. Me- ;
Mann was a Democrat he had hosts of
friends in all parties.
Mr. McMann was born in Glasgow
sixty-six years ago. He came to Cali- ;
fornia in 1852 and settled on the spot ;
where his present home is situated.
Then the surrounding country was a |
series of sandhills. Shortly after his
arrival Mr. McMann became a mem
ber of the volunteer fire department
and gained distinction during the fierce I
conflagrations that swept over the city i
in the early days. He was a member j
of the Assembly for several terms and ,
made his influence felt in that body.
In 1886 he was elected Sheriff of San :
Francisco and made a record that will
still be remembered. He was the last {
Sheriff to serve in the old City Hall
and the first in the new building.
The news of his death comes as a '
shock to his host of friends. Only
Thursday he acted as pallbearer to a
former attache of his office. John Mc-
Govern. He was in his usual cheerful
spirits when he bade good-night to his
family and retired. Yesterday morning
he was seized with severe pains in the
region of the heart. A physician was
summoned and Mr. McMann seemed
much relieved under treatment. But
two hours later he passed away. His
wife is heart-broken over her bereave- ,
ment.
He is survived by a widow and four
children, Thomas S., Edwin F., Walter
E. and Irene McMann. He was a mem
ber of the Veteran Firemen's Associa

place on Monday from his late resi

REV. JAMES H. WARREN DEAD.
Well Known Clergyman Expires Sud- \
denly at Dayton, Wash.
The Ttev. James H. Warren, who
for mor"e than a quarter of a century
served as superintendent of Congre
gational home missions, died sudden
ly in Dayton, Wash., yesterday morn- I
ing at the home of Dr. M. Pietrzeki, j
his son-in-law.
Dr. Warren was born in Michigan i
sixty-eight years ago. In his youth he
engaged in the fur business. Later he j
became a student at Knox College, j
Galesburg, 111., for which institution
he prepared while a member of the
household of Owen Lovejoy, the fam
ous Congressman and abolitionist of !
Illinois.
Dr. Warren prepared for the min
istry at the Union Theological Sem
inary in New York and was ordained
in 1850. Shortly afterward he mar
ried Miss Emily Churchill of Gales- j
burg, 111., and started for California.
He served as pastor of the First Con
gregational Church at Nevada City.
In the early '60's he was made super
intendent of the church's home mis
sions.
Mrs. Warren died several months
ago. Four children survive the pa
rents. They are Mrs. Pietrzeki, Anna,
Eleanor and Clarence H. Warren.

Silver Loses His Job.
"Ike" Silver, who was stricken
from the eligible list of ordinary
clerks by the Civil Service Commis

fraud in taking the examination, was
dismissed from his position by Tax
Collector Smith yesterday. Silver had
sued out a writ of injunction about a
month ago to restrain Smith from re
moving him, but as he is no longer
a civil service eligible Smith had no
alternative but to dismiss him. Flor
ence McAuliffe, another civil service
eligible, was also removed upon orders
from the commission because there
was no work for him to do, but made
no contest. Another clerk named
Higgins sued out an injunction two
years ago to restrain Smith from re
moving him and was left undisturbed
in his position.
