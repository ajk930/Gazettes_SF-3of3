MAYOR ANGRY .
'. ATSITUATION
â¢Fhe actual work of drafting the "treaty
cf Portsmouth" was begun to-day. It Is
being done by Mr. de Maartens and Mr.
DenniEon, acting as legal advisers for the
respective sides. While the "bases" of
peace have been accepted by the pleni
potentiaries, considerable detail remains
to be worked out in the elaboration of
the articles of the treaty. This is espe
cially true in regard to the articles deal
ing with the Chinese Eastern Railroad
and the surrender of the leases of the
L>iaotung Peninsula and Port Arthur and
Talienwan (Dalny). Mr. Pokotiloff. the
Russian Minister to Peking, who was [
formerly manager of the Rusao-Chinese ;
Bank at Peking and who has intimate :
knowledge of all the details relating to
those matters, is assisting De Maartens.
An anomolous situation exists as to the
impression created by the conclusion of
peace. While the outside world applauds.
In Japan there Is evidently great disap
pointment over the terms, and in Rus
sia, where it would seem that there
should be general rejoicing over the great
diplomatic victory Mr. de Witte has won,
the Government seems to have received it
coldly.
WAR PABTY IS CHAGHEVED.
With the people it will make Mr. de
Wltte a great and popular figure and add
to his laurels, but at the court evidently
the victory that Mr. de Wltte has
achieved makes it ' all the. more bitterly
resented.
It Is an open secret that when the Em
peror appointed Mr. de Witte chief pleni
potentiary the "military party" expected
him to faiL It did not want peace, and
It was freely predicted in SL Petersburg
when Mr. de Wltte left that he had been
given an Impossible mission. Ills enemies
expected him to fall In the negotiations
or to make a "bad peace," and either
would have spelled \u25a0 political ruin. In
stead, upon the very terms upon which
the Emperor told Mr. , Meyer he would
make peace and upon which the military
party did not believe it possible for peace
to be negotiated, Mr.; de Witte succeeded
in securing a treaty honorable, and, in
the circumstances, ' favorable to' Russia.
This has only exasperated his enemies
the more, and intrigue is again at work
to discredit him.. Since Japan was in a
conciliatory mood, they now say, he has
made a mistake in surrendering half of
Saghalien. Yet he did so by the Czar's
orders and himself inEists that, person
ally, he would have adhered to his orig
inal declaration - not to cede territory or
give indemnity. .
KWOY S iEK SO DANGER.
In view of the situation,; both: at To
kio and at St. Petersburg, alarmists ; are
inclined to make much. of the. fact. that
the minutes of yesterday's' fateful meet-
Ing have not been sJgmed x?y. the.plenipo
tentiaries of the two powers. .: It is. point
ed out that either side could still repu
diate the agreement, but both plenipoten
tiaries refuse to admit even the possibility
of Â«uch an" eventuality.
The following statement of the . Japan
ese argument . which governed their- de
cision, to waive the question of Indemnity
can be 'accepted as authoritative:
"Japan realized fully she was making a
sacrifice 'for peace, but she was. looking
to/the future.- It:; was not a question: of
AT WORK I'PO.V THE TREATY.
PORTSMOUTH. N. H.. Aug. SO.-"Is it
possible for Russia and Japan to form an
alliance so long as the new treaty Just
eigned between Great Britain and Japan
Is in force?" Is a question which has been
much discussed here in view of the ac
tion of the envoys in deciding to insert in
the treaty a clause which shall extend to
both nations preferential treatment
known as the "most favored nation
clause."
This is to stand until a fuller under
standing can be reached between Japan
and Russia in a commercial treaty, which
is to be negotiated between them soon
after the dissolution of the present con
ference.
Other nations are etill apprehensive that
Japan may form" an alliance with Russia,
whereby the recent foes will have exclu
sive privileges in Korea and Manchuria
and will be able to hold trade to the dis
advantage of competing nations. Despite
; the "open door" provisions, which are
understood to have been agreed on be-
Uiwn Mr. <3e /U'ltte and "Baron Komura,'
It would seem that the occasion is ripe
for some eort of understanding, and that
In one important particular it will be
necessary, unless an .international ar
rangement be made for the control of the
Eastern Chinese Railway. As . matters
now stand with reference to that great
property. Russia and Japan will each own
a portion of this road. <
Baron Rosen, speaking to-day of future
relations between Russia and Japan,
voiced the thought that is undoubtedly
topmost in the Russian mind when he
caid:
"We of Russia fondly hope that the re
lations between Japan and Russia may
become 1 close, commercially and in every
other sense. To that end we are now la
boring, since it is certain that we are to
have peace."

to convey the' sentiment of practically, all

There are undoubtedly certain

or another of ; thev points s^t forth in . the

-"Geta the CUlnene Eastern Railroad or

PORTSMOUTH, Aug. 30.â The formal
* recognition of Japan's possession of the
... Chinese Eastern Railroad below Kuen-
L chengtse, the junction of the branch with
Kiriu. involves payment by Russia tt>
China of a sum estimated at $73,000,000.
This Is the Chinese interest In the road
''and foi it China must i>e remunerated.
The Question of ultimate possession of
\u25a0the road Isa matter to.be settled by-Ja
pan and China. Japan .can keep the road
â¢ or surrender it to China, demanding in
c return th.c money paid by Russia to
-.-China. If she elects the latter course,
, Japan will therefore obtain as an indi
rect "spoil of war" from Russia the
. aforye-mentioned sum, in addition to re
. imbursement for the cost of maintaining
the Russian prisoners of war, for which
.Japan will aresent an Itemized bill.
Japan is known to have given her word
to China not to retain the railroad, which
Anas really built for strategic purposes.
But, if^ China prefers the money to the
railroad, Japan need not be accused of
bad faith; Inasmuch as Japan was de
sirous even before the war of_ extending
the then projected Korean Railroad, which
is already in operation, co as to eventu
ally connect with the Eastern Chinese and
Shanhaikwan roads, and, In the negotia
tions which preceded hostilities asked :
Russia to bind herself not to Impede this
aim, it Is considered likely that she would
hereelf prefer the railroad to the money.
/In addition to turning over the money
"obtained from Russia. China, if she took
the railroad, would have to reimburse Ja
pan fer the expenses iucurred.by her in
jestorlÂ«is the road, rebuilding the bridges
and. changing the gauge. Whether it re
'malas in the hands of Japan or ultimately
becomes a part of the system. of Chinese
"imperial railroads, a traffic arrangement
must be made with tUe .party still in the
\u25a0possession of- the old -Chinese Eastern
Â« Company, the stqck of which is held b>
X*lbe Russla.-Chinese" Bank. I This aJJust
j<'ment would be arranged later.'
i'J- Both Russia and. Japan, if the latter re
>'taln the road, arc to be allowed to have

?.'the railroad property, and,' In case of dls

V Whistle uoftly. We are getting into
tLu? thin tlnihcr. but -we are not. yet out
. of the woods."
This adroonjtion represents accurate
ly PresJdtfni. Roosevelt's view of the
situation at Portsmouth. \u25a0 Peace is In
Fight, but- it Is not yet an accomplished
fact. Pmioundly as he Is gratified at
\u25a0 the . results already achieved by the
plenipotentiaries, the President realizes
fully that the most important, work re
mains yej. to be-<lpne. Until, more -is
accomplished it -<s scarcely the : part of
wisdom, he thinks, to do more than
. "whistle softly."
Jt is probable -that President Roose
. velt will make a formal expression*con
cerning the work accomplished at
-Portsmouth by the Russian. and Japan
ese envoys, but the intimation .to-day
was that he would not make such a
-statement in any event until he should
\u25a0 have been assured of the success of
â¢ the conference.
The importance of the text of the va
rious s^tions of the treaty is not mini
inix^Ki.bj-, the President, and he appre
ciiit^s thoroughly that obstacles may
-arise at any moment that might delay
seriously negotiations or possibly
wreck them entirely. The, woods will
not be cleared entirely until the treaty
shall have been signed and seal-ed, ;c i,.. '.
.- Jj The |>lacÂ« to be selected for the ap
pending of signatures to the treaty
-raises a Question of . interest. It was
assumed before . the meeting of the
conferees that the treaty, wherever It
might be negotiated, would be signed
in Washington and be known hereafter
as the "treaty of Washington," as the
* conference itself, although held at
Portsmouth, is known a"s the Washinj?
' ton conference. It is proposed that the
Figning of the treaty take place at
SSgaraore Hill as a compliment to
President Roosevelt for his part in in
itiating, the conference and bringing it
'to a successful issue. The treaty then
would be known as the "treaty of Saga
more Hili," and would g-o down in his
tory along with many other important
conventions which have been concluded
at places other than continental capi
tals. This question lies wholly with
the conferees, and it is likely to re
main undetermined until they practi
cally have concluded their work.

an "injunction to prevent the\ Aetna
Company? from withdrawing frtai bis
bond Judge Seawell says: . V"
\u25a0 The statute does not provide any procedure
by which the surety upon an official \bond
shall withdraw irom. the bond otherwise than
by tiling- his declaration of his deÂ»tre to uo no
and giving the reason for such action.
rhtrelore so much, of the prayer as Â«e?ics
to restrain; the surety from witnurawing Irom
the bond U or no mument. because the surety
does not withdraw trom the bond, but ATter.
the expiration of a certain time, unless an
other bund Is filed by the officer. It is the d^ty
of the r Mayor and the Auditor to declare the
office vacant; and, as a consequence of thftt
.declaration, the ottlce being vacant, the sure
ty is released . from all further Uabtlltl*
thereafter accruing on the bond. \
The surety . having already diwie all' that it
could do. the Injunction sought la really to re-\
strain the Mayor and the Auditor from de- 1
claring the plaintiff's office vacant and releas
ing the snrety from all further liability. It Is
contended on the part of the plaintiff that tho
surety had no rtsht to withdraw from this
bond by reason of Its contract with the plain
.tiff, having accspted a premium before, going
.on the- bond. .and having also accepted ihe sum
of, slooo deposited with it aa further security.
So " far as the $1000 is concerned. I find from
the evidence that such was deposited to-In
demnify the snrety from a particular class of
liability, that is. from th* expenses of litiga
tion.
It appears that two suits have already been
begun - against - the surety here jointly with
the -plaintiff, one to recover 550, C00 and the
other to â¢Â» recover $2.\000 damages; and the
reason given by the surety In Its statement
filed with thÂ« Mayor and the Auditor of Its
reason from- withdrawing from" the bond Is
that it fears loss -if It remains on the bond.
That etatement appears to . havo - been con
firmed by the fact. that It has already been
made defendant . in two suits for sums aggre
gating $75,000. Some evidence waÂ» offered
tending to. show that there was no reason for
this apprehension on the- part of the surety.
XO POWER TO I>TESTIGATE.
The requirement that thÂ» - surety should
state Its reason, for .withdra^ng . from thÂ«
bond. In my opinion, was not Inserted for the
benefit of -the officer at all or to satisfy htm
in any respect. It is simply for the benefit of
the public that the public might know when
a surety withdraws from the bond of a publio
officer for what reason the surety withdraws;*
that Is aIL Neither the Mayor nor the Auditor
is vested with any power to lnvesttsrate 'tHl*
question to determine whether the - reason
Slve'n Is good or not. nor Is the surety required
to give any particularly good reason, so . to
speak." but It may be simply Its whim,' a ca
price, a desire, perhaps, simply to gratify* Its
own desire In the matter. It -may be that In
the enactment of this statute the Legislature*
had It in mind that the surety might withdraw
by reason of some misconduct on the part of
the official; If so. the public is Interested in
knowing that fact, ami I am satisfied that thÂ»
Insertion of this requirement was not to sat
isfy the officer, but. simply to satisfy the pub
lic as to the reason why a surety upon the bond
of a puWlc- officer desires 'to -withdraw from,
his bond.
I think,- frqm what I ha.ye. said, that tha
conclusion necessarily follows that thÂ» surety
in this case^ has a risht to withdraw from, this
contract. And In addition to that I doubt
whether it iÂ» the policy of the law that public*
officers, such as the Mayor and Auditor,
should -be involved !n a controversy of this
nature. The statute Is clear and explicit that
a surety may, on flllnsr such a statement, bÂ«
rellevM from all liability thereafter to arise,
and that tn ten days after the service of such
notice the officer wtth whom the samÂ« Is
filed must make an order declaring such oTfloÂ«
vacant, and releasing such sureties from all
liability thereafter to be Incurred.
It seems to me to be In conflict with -the
spirit of the law to say that the officers with,
whom a statement Is filed should defer tbHr
declaration until thÂ» end of some litigation
that '\u25a0 the officer might commence against the
: surety.
For these reasons I have concluded that the
application for injunction ' should be denied In
this case and the demnrrars sustained. In
this case there Is no reason stated by th*
surety for withdrawing from this bond affÂ»ct-
Ins the Integrity of the officer at all; the sure
ty Is simply exercising Its legal right to with
draw from thts bond.
. MAESTRETTI IS UNCERTAIN.
.When asked as to his intentions.
Maestretti said he would immediately
endeavor to secure a bond, personal
or -corporate.' and expressed his belief
that the National Surety Company
would " lmmediately come to his aid/"Aa
to" what further action he would take.
he said that first he would have to con
sult "his 'attorney; R. H. Countryman.
He could not say what his next move
would be."? 5 v
Mayor Schmltz was not so uncertain
!as to his course. His Honor said he
j had not as yet been officially -notified oC
the cancellation of Maestretti' s bond.
and -his ousting from office by-' the
Auditor. *
"If such a thing has occurred." said
the Mayor, "1 will take it that the eom
missionershlp is vacant and will' ap
point a 'new Commlssfoner, * -who -will
be Frank A. Maestretti.' I hare re
ceived no notification from : the* Indem
nity company that they have with
drawn from his bond. I have not been
told by the court that the bond has
been canceled.- I have not seen the
opinion of Judge Seawell, and hare-no
official knowledge that it exists.

EXPERT EXONERATED
VICTORIA, B. C. Aug. 80.â It was as
certained to-day .that J. Moffltt of the cus
toms secret service of San Francisco was
lately In Victoria to Inquire Into all' the
records of the Carmendta, and Into the
business transactions of the schooner
Victoria. He wished to know, among
other things, who paid the vessel's bills,
with a view to establishing the ownership
of the schooner. He was surprised to
find, among other documents in the cus
toms, the credentials of the Mexican Con
sul General. The Consul has been ill and
unable lo be present at any of the inves
tigations which the officials have held in
the Carmendta case.
Victoria marine men are speculating as
to where the schooner will likely land her
valuable cargo of sealskins taken in a
raid on one of the cookeries In Bering
Sea. The crew are offenders against the
American and Mexican governments,
rather than against the Canadian Govern
ment. They are probably aware of that
fact, and therefore will land where' they
will have the least trouble. Should it be
at Victoria, as many expect, it is believed
the Carmendta will be seized for not hav
ing proper papers. His Majesty's ship
Shearwater, now, due at Esquimalt, Is ex
pected to bring word of the Carmendta's
movements.

.. '.'The .clouds prevented a perfect obser

The design 1 of the corona was not so beau
tiful as that of the eclipse of 1900, but the
contrast .was; greater.*
-"In.the eclipse of 1900 the sky was black;
to-day. It was gray. I found the corona
" decidedly -4 circular, - typifying maximum
solar activity. In 1900 the corona was ob
long,-showing minimum activity. To-day

BOOSTER, Ohio. Aug. 30.â Mrs. Tag
gast was again the center of . attraction
to-day In the Taggaxt divorce case. She
conducted herself in admirable manner
while undergoing the severe cross-exam
ination by Attorney Sterjlng. Only once
or twice did Sterling succeed in wringing
from her admissions harmful to her case.
One Instance was her confession that she
continued to associate with Lieutenant
Forteecue after her husband had request
ed her not to. She eaid:
"He was ensry when he told me not to
go to Poore's house, because Fortescue
was there, but I thought he was very
unreasonable and went, anythow."
She admitted that, one evening, before
Congressman Berry's deposition was
taken, she drank a glass of beer with
him la his rocm at Newport. â¢ â¢*
During the time when Captain Taggart
would be eway from home in Manila on
lelief and she remained at home she fre
quently went driving, sometimes with the
children and sometimes with Captain
Bath and other officers.
The visit of Captain Ryther to Mrs.
Taggart at midnight at Fort .Thomas was
taken un.
"When Howard Taggart came down
stairs for a drink that night, why did you
po along with him back to the ice box?"
cbe was asked.
"Because he was in his night gown, and
I wanted to shield him ana keep Ryther
from seeing him," she replied.
Mrs. Taggart was still on the stand
when court adjourned until to-morrow.

NEW YORK. Aug. 30.â Struck by light
ning in the midst of a. terriflc electric
storm, bar foremast shattered by a bolt
which knocked on* of her crew senseless
and severely injured others. . and which,
moreover, demagnetized the compass so
that the captain could no longer trust. to
it as a guide, the Norwegian steamship
Bodo reached this port to-day.
Since Friday the craw had known that
the captain had been forced' to trust to
the uncertain guidance of a small boat
compass, the deviation of which was not
known, and day and night they had been
kept busy heaving deep sea lead., . ." '\u25a0":\u25a0
The Bodo is from Port Antonio, Ja
maica, and came In with tropical fruits.'
It was on the mariners' evil day of Fri
day, and early in 'the forenoon, when the
electric storm broke ln^a series of blind
ing flashes. Shoulderlng v her way through
the lightning, dazed by the seas, the ship
suddenly quivered. Captain Flgenshow
said his first thought was that the boilers
had exploded, so severe had been the
shock. Then he saw several of his men
sprawled about the foremast, and at the
same time noticed that the foretopmast
was all aglow and that the stays had
been carried away. The captain paused
here to describe the appearance of the
foretopmast. a wooden spar, which" he
said had been so charged by the bolt as
to emit a glow like that of charcoal lit
by fire.
Boatswain Nellson. who had been stand
ing near the mast, was in the lee scup
pers wholly unconscious, and several oth
ers of the crew who had been standing
near had been so shocked that it was
days before they could resume duty.

SACRAMENTO. Aug. - 30wâ During his

Harriman. ; president . of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company, gave ' orders to
the engineering. department 'here to make
a survey ; for the construction 'of | a great
tunnel through, the Slskiyou * Mountains.
The , tunnel Ms. ; to ; be ready for operation
within" three Jy ears. ;â - â
" It is stated* that president Harriman
made the. order, for the tunnel on account
of the fact that it Is calculated that the
northern part of California will be rapid
ly developed : , within ,. the * next r few ; years
and \ that a great * population . will pour in.
It is also expected there will be rapid de
velopment, in .'Washington and Oregon,
and the railroad company will have to be
in V a position: to handle the increasing
business . more rapidly than it - Is ' able ; to
do at -the ; . present -time./"
The tunnel; through .the Slskiyou Moun
tains â¢wiir.be - the means of greatly re-,
ducing.the grade, so that faster .time may
bf made between California and Portland,

FORT ERIE SELECTIONS.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 30. â Britt and
Nelson will have to make another bid
if they want the services of r Jeffries
as ' referee. It may be necessary; for
them to more, than double their offer
of $500, because the retired champion
thinks he is worth more than that. He
is in such financial circumstances that
he does not need the money. Jeffries
left' for Santa Catalina this morning
to remain' several days. The wireless
telegraph system between the Island
and the mainland is not working to
night and therefore he could hot be
communicated with personally. >
Before 'his departure he had a con
ference with a* number of his friends
during which he talked: of his plans.
Jim v Morley, manager of the Los An
geles baseball team, who Is 1 possibly
closer 1 to Jeffries \u25a0 than any other -per
son in Los Angeles, declared to-night
that Jeffries would | not consider an of
fer of less than $1000 for ' his ; services
as referee. "I know just how he feels
about it," said Morley. , "He told me
that although Ihe has 1 not received i the
formal offer of $500, he considers that
turn; too small. '-â¢ He ' says it would be
like making of f the : coming; : - fight a
cheap'affair. His last word to 1 me was
to the effect that ;be was : willing *to
act as referee provided, the managers
make it worth his ; while, : but 1 he,, will
not touch that offer of : $500. If they
want him they'll have to : " atT.' least
double It and then perhaps add- some."
Morley ; und ; Jeffries . are , the prime
movers In a new athletic club which'
is intended to rival v anything ;of |the
kind in the- north. ~;They are backed
by abundant capital, but they : have de
clined thus far. to ; disclose their plans.
It ; is known. ; however, ; that : the : , new
organization;; will^ be of such a; char
actt^r/aS; toattract: to Itself the/atten
tion of the pugilistic world:'-' It is to be
incorporated,"; to have \u25a0a , fineVclubhouse,'
and its ?\u25a0 purpose Â£ will -to

FORT ERIE ENTRIES.
The wise bettors figure that Britt has
many qualifications to offset the strength
of Kelson. which is , his chief stock in
trade. The total amount of money wag
ered on the fight will run into big figures,
as people all over the country will want
to have something up on the result. Nel
son's countrymen to a man will put up
modest bets on him, as they have done in
all his other fights in : this city. . These
people, , who never thought of betting
when other men were the principals, have
taken a flier on the Dane.f He has al
ways brought home the'money for them
since his sudden rise to fame except in
the memorable battle with Britt. . â¢
The betting on the 3ritt-Nelson fight
opened yesterday, with the Californian a
10 to 9 favorite. The Britt stock has gone
up to such a degree since the Sullivan
flght that it is evident at this early date
he will be a pronounced public choice.
From appearances, once the full volume
of betting sets in, the odds will surely go
to 10 to 7. , ; .

boxer. The lightest possible exercise that
would keep "him in health and land him
in the ring at the required weight is what
he needs. Many a promising fighter has
had his career spoiled by Inefficient hand
ling, and Nelson may find himself in that
class.' He is' being worked as though he
had twenty pounds of superfluous flesh
on him, â¢ whereas he 1c practically at
weight and the fight is still ten days off.
Unless there is a radical change in his
handling his backers will not get a run
for their money when he meets the fresh
and , vigorous Britt. Nelson nslther
smokes nor" drinks and is practically In
condition the year round. The . gentlest
exercise^that will keep him in health and
his muscles In condition is what he needs
to bring out his best efforts. .
There is an adage among horsemen in
Australia that "many a race is left on
the sand." If ever a fighter seems on the
verge of leaving a race on the sand it is
Battling Nelson. The Hegewlch cham
pion looks gaunt and Jaded at the present
time from the effects of the extreme heat
at his . Marin County training quarters
and of the unusually severe work he ts
doing. At this time, when lie should be
storing up the vitality which -is his chief
stock in trade as a fighter he is burning
it up with unnecessarily hard training.
To withstand the work he did yesterday
at his Colma training quarters he should
weigh from 138 to 140 pounds. Instead of
having this added weight on which to
work he Is down under 135 pounds, and
shows it. His shoulders no longer give
that impression of Immense driving pow
er, the shoulder blades being prominent
where the muscles used to show. If he
keeps on at his present rate- of work he
will be able to fight in the bantam class
before another week passes. His present
system of training if followed out until
the day of the fight will surely tell on
him if he has to go a long route. Instead
of building up his natural vitality he will
have exhausted what he Had in store
after his mountain, trip. At the present
time he seems to be training on the lines
that would be adopted in sending a horse
in training for a four-mile race at that
distance each day at the top of his speed.
Flesh and blood can stand no such pres
sure, and when a breakdown comes na
ture requires a long time to repair the
damage.
Nelson has not improved in -boxing,
either in the hitting department or in de
fensive work. He had Bob Lundle and
Abe Label as partners yesterday, and
each could hit him whenever and wher
ever he pleased. L.undie, the amateur,
had had a severe fight the night before,
but in wrestling with Nelson and in box
ing he showed greater strength and more
skill. Nelson's trainers said yesterday
they Intended to give him, a let-up and al
low bis weight, to reach the 138-pound
mark. It would. have been an advantage
to him to have done this yesterday, in
stead of urging him on to unusual efforts
in his jaded condition.
How his manager, seeing him at work
from day to day, could allow him to get
Into such condition was a ourprise to
some of the followers of boxing who bew
him work out. It required no technical
knowledge to see that the schedule of
training laid o~ut for him did not fit his
case at all.

LATONIA EXTKIES.
Miss May Irwin. star of 'Mrs. Black
Is Back." has seen our Jimmy Britt at
\u25a0work â and ?he likes his chances. By
this it must not be construed that Miss
Irwin is a judge of fighters. She sim
ply evinces an admiration for all
tilings pertaining to athletics and all
outdoor sports, and after, gazing with
li^art palpitations us California's great
lightweight rocked his sparring part
imjs with right and left swings, she
thinks the one that defeats him will
havr^to go some.
America's favorite comedienne, ac- ;
Â«ompaniod by her two sons, Walter and
Harry, Miss Jane Burpee and Messrs.
â¢ I*. J. Anhalt and X- Eisfeldt of the |
â¢Mrs. Black Is Back" company paid
:m automobile visit to Britt at his |
i^heehans villa training headquarters
yesterday afternoon. Shuster and Miss
Anna LJchter of the Tivoli company
were also among those present
extirh yr.irK i.v actiox.
Tor the occasion Jimmy marshaled
his full training force, not even forget
ting Advi6er Spider Kelly, and there
vats no more enthusiastic admirers of '
things doing in the big gathering 1
crowding the gym to its fullest ca
pacity than Miss Irwin. Early on her
arrival the Columbia's star was intro
duced in true sporting fashion to fol
lower^ of the camp, and between bouts
James Britt Sr. explained the Intrica
cies of the boxing game to the the
atrical folk.
Jimmy Britt appeared to be in par
ticularly fine fettle, his mix-ups with
Frank Raphael and "Brother Bill" be
.ing almost as rough and exciting as
the real thing. After three hurricane
rounds with Raphael Jimmy took on
Manager Willis. After two brief but
speedy rounds the latter began re
moving the gloves. "What's the mat
tor. Bill?" said Jimmy. "Oh. nothing,"
remarked the latter, "I'm afraid you
may hurt, your hands."
JUAVAGKK UIL.LnS SCES STARS.
Just as Spider Kelly called time for
tfje second round the manager poked
his jaw into a rigrht-hander that made
him see a $000,000,000 house at Colma
on September 9. Without blowing
hard enough to snuff a candle Britt
next took on "Ti\-" Kreling in an ex
tended round of lugging and wrestling.
Ropeskipping, bagpunching, shadow
sparring and the weights completed
the gymnasium work.
Next Britt and his retinue of train
ers retired to the beach, where surf
bathing was indulged in for a dozen
minutes. The camera fiends here had
an inning also.
Before returning to town Miss Irwin
remarked that she was entranced with
our climate, but said, "You people out
lure do not appreciate it." Asked if
Fhe would like to see 'a' genuine glove
contest, the quick reply came back.
"Would I like to see one!!! Well, I'd
just love to." But Miss Irwin will in
trust the mission of relating how the
winner won to her handsome son
Harry, who is a naval cadet at Annap
olis.

ONTARIO, Aug. 30.â Marshal Ney

Fort Erie card to-day, and only three
others went to the post with him. ThÂ»
best rrlce obtainable about him waj

result considered, as he went to the
front and galloped along at his own
sweet will and won in it romp by at
least ten lengths. The light for placo
narrowed down to a nose finish, bat
that was on account of an incompetent

OLD SORES
ROOTED IN THE BLOOD
Old Sores are the result of a deeply
polluted, foul blood supply. The blood
is filled with poisons, and as it finds an
outlet through the ulcer, the surround-
ing parts become diseased and the sore
eats deeper into the tissues and flesh and
becomes a permanent trouble.
Some years ago while at work, I fell
over a truck and severely injured both
of my shins. Ky blood became poisoned
as a result, and the doctor told me I
would have running' sores for life, and
that if they were closed up the result
would be fatal. Under this discourag-
ing report I left off their treatment and
resorted to the use of S. S. 8. Its effects
were prompt and gratifying-. It took
only a short while for the medicine to
entirely euro up the sores, and I am not
dead as the doctors intimated I would
be. neither have the sores ever broken
out again, and some twelve years have
elapsed since what I have described oc-
curred. Having been so signally bene-
fited by Its use I can heartily recom-
mend it as the one great blood purifier.

Salves, powders, plasters, etc, do no
good, and the sufferer gets disgusted and
often despairs of curing an old sore. The <
trouble is in the blood and until the poison-
ous matter that is keeping up the ulcer is
driven out the place cannot heal. S. S. S.
reaches these old sores through the blood
by removing every particle of poison or
impurity from the circulation and build-
ing up the system. It makes the blood

Russ Hall was the star of the day. He
continued, his great work, at short, cut
ting off several sure-looking hits by fast
footwork and an unerring wing to first.
Runkle, who played ball like a hay baler
last .week, turne*d around yesterday and
made the fans think he was Lajole by the
manner in which he grabbed the hot
ones around the, second sack. The rest of.
the team worked in unison with the; two
stellar lights.
; The Seals' best chance came in the sixth
: spasm, and .they.e mbraced it: for a pair
of runs. "Waldroh started with a wallop
over third, but Houtz tnrew_ him out
when he tried to stretch it into a double.

through to right with a fast double. He
ligered only a moment, for Nealon was
; there with a clean drive that made the
j score 2 to 0.

run or two in ; the last Inning, but Hall
blasted their hopes by flying to center.

A h;g boom of logs got away from Mis
sion Bay on Tucsiay night and daylight
yesterday found the -siateis of vhe harbor
Etrewn irtth rr.er.aces to navigation. The
ebb ;idc, the ripples of which had caused
the parting of tho Â«.h;iin which held the
icstraining barrier in place, carried the
\u25a0o?s out to sea :iii<l for several days ves
sels coming in and soing out will have to
keep a sharp lookout. Any one of these
nauny piU:s cculd drive a hole in the
stoutest vessel afloat and until the winds
and currents dispose of those the owners
and others did not capture, eailormen will
have cause for added anxiety.
The steamer J. S. Higgins, which ar
rived yesterday from Fort Bragg, thread
ed her way through floating piles from
Point Bonita to Fort Point and several
times: narrowly escaped having her hull
punctured by one of the formidable bat
tering rams.
The piles formed part of one of the log
rafts recently towed here from the Co
lumbia River. This raft was pulled apart
in Mission Bay, where the logs are cor
raled and held awaiting purchasers. The
last log raft to arrive is anchored near
by and is still intact. In the boom are
several thousand logs and should a south
easter sweop the bay the restraint which
proved inadequate to resist an ordinary
ebb tide would be as nothing at all and
navigation in the harbor would for a time
be almost impossible.
The logs which went adrift on Monday
Tiight belong to the Hammond Lumber
Company.
A small tug boat and two gasoline
launches were engaged by the owners of
the piles to gather in as many as possible,
but there are still enough of them adrift,
to cause serious damage to any vessel
unfortunate enough to cross their path.
Two small boys found two of the wan
dering Diles not far from the sugar re
finery and in trying to take their salvage
to market nearly lost their lives. Each
balanced on a pile, they were carried
away from shore by the tide. Their cries
attracted the attention of the people on
the sugar refinery wharf and a launch '
was sent to the rescue.

MISS CAROLINE CRAWFORD,, of Teachers^. College, Co-;
â¢ I.umbia University, is an enthusiast on .the subject of teach
ing little children to dance because of its educational 'value
arid" its relation to the growth- and entire development of the indi
vidual. She has made it a particular study and is .doing a great deal
f %o make teachers realize its importance in the training of youth. The
auKioritics of Teachers' College arc- strongly supporting her posi
tion and enterprise in the matter, and they have three, dancing
courses in the department of "Physical Education," all inicharge of
"Jliss Crawford. ', s \ , . â¢ ; Â°
There are good reasons given by those, who have paid attention
to the subject why the Jessons should begin at. an early age. .En
thusiasts'for the- adoption .of it as a regular part of child; education
consider the art of motion as truly an art as -are music and poetry,
and as motion is- the first expression of^ itself -the* chihd can 'give
it naturally follows that this is the first art. that can and should be
taught. Gesture is the first means of displaying intelligence and
that the baby is endowed withj and -ail through life it- is riot 1
onfy a method of. revealing the. soul that. ahimates the body, but. the
right culture of it tends to react upon ; the spirit "and/ give it .tlie
â¢ grace, assurance and facility that correspond to the" outward iction.
Dancing is a part of this physical â¢expression arid is 'an ally
to excellence in many waj-s. The courses given. by Miss Crawford
cover 8 not only, "Rhythm and' Daricing,? .but " deal, with dramatic
games and the _ illustration of -fplklore: . The ,idea is Said : to be
steadily growing in New York. among the .teachers that this dancing
education is not merely a frill and ornament but almost a necessity
of. the school course. apfeBBBBMBHEBB ' . \u25a0.â¢'â¢; ; .- \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0';*'

SOME ODD FREAKS OF NATURE.
-^s^f?- TERMS OF PEACE.
''&f :â: â - . . ' - .
BEFORE thankfulK^dismissing the subject, it is in, order to
consider the term's of peace between Japan and Russia. Mr.
. de Witte lost his diplomatic head after the negotiation ; was
over and did some rather swagger talking, that was boyish" and highly
undiplomatic. Japan secured from Russia admission of every, claim
she made beforÂ« the war began. By this we mean every political
claim, for prior to the war she did not propose to disturb Russian pos
session of Port Arthur, Dalny and Mukden, nor Russian ownership
of the railroad down the peninsula to Port Arthur. Japan gains
therefore all her political conditions, and Russia loses Port Arthur,
Dalny, the peninsula, the railroad and all Manchuria. She loses also
her control of Korea and the concessions that had been the means
of asserting it. She is again shut away from open water and is
driven back to Vladivostok and Petropavlovski as her seaports on
the frontier of Siberia. :\ft! .". . ;
Mr. de Witte's exultation was caused by avoiding the payment
of a war indemnity, and was enhanced by what he declared in terms
as the "gaining of half of the island of Saghalien." Six weeks ago
Russia had all of that island. Instead of gaining half of it, therefore,
she loses half of it. Such comments would riot be necessary if the
Russian. envoy had imitated the diplomatic self-poise of the Japan
ese. Japan has introduced the highest ethics into the subject of
peace at the end of a victorious war. She- has put principles above
money, by surrendering^an indemnity, while the Russian makes the
tactical mistake of putting money above principles by boasting that
his cation saved its kopecks.
There is no doubt that Japan distrusted the good faith of Russia
in the negotiations, and made her original terms with the. view of
catching the Czar where he could not back out. It was diplomacy
of the highest order to first secure the concession of everything
that Japan asked before a gun was fired, increasedby the material
advantages won by her* arms. .Then when Russia was placed where
she c could back. out only on the question of indemnity, that was so
suddenly surrendered that a refusal to make peace was impossible
without accepting the' enormous responsibility of continuing the
slaughter by an act of bad faith that would have deepened the
hatred, of the world.
It may never be surely known, but the surface indications are
that President Roosevelt was confided in , by Baron Kaneko, and
knew the policy of Japan, and used his .knowledge to. bring about the
final situation which surprised the Russians into acquiescence.
s Â°The war in -many' high respects was the most' remarkable in h :
toryv llj involved the existence of both China and Japan! Jt meant
the restraint of the ' Western nations in Eastern Asia if Japan Avon,
and it meant that Christendom must be delivered from debauching
itself by- inhuman aggression upÂ°on the helpless. The evident policy
of- Russia being resistance until 1 Japan', though victorious, would be ;
exhausted, it became of the highest/importance to make peace before
thrit point was reached, and at the same time to save all oi Japan's
contention and establish justice for Eastern Asia. This 0 has been
dprie, and for the accomplishment of it all President Roosevelt is re-Â°
c Spoils ible, and he stands out as the foremost r man in the world.
How greatly *his action has clarified the view at home and
abroad! He lias been reproached as a man of war, whose impetuos
ity is liable -at any moment to lead his" country into war. He has been
accused of temperamental disposition to disturbance, and of a trucu
lent tendency that made him unsafe as the President of 'the republic.
But when Kings and Emperors flinched and dared not fake the ini
tiative toward ending the horrors of a great war, he, by the keenest
and wisest diplomacy, brought the belligerents together and held
them together in the face, of all discouragements until they came
to terms* and peace .is the result.; To-day he is the center of at
tention from Lassa to Rome and is the foremost^ figure in every
Asiatic, European and American capital. The envoys of the two'
nations concerned, even De Witte, when he recovered his poise, freely
concede to the President the credit of^making a lasting peace. So
this -man. of war, reproached by partisans among his countrymen,
has sheathed the swords and unshotted the guns of a million sol
diers, on the Manchurian- plains, and has sent the warriors to their
wives and families, their homes arid thdir countries.
'It will in the future be seen that the most significant chapter
in the history of man has been written by Americans, between -John
Hay's identical note guaranteeing the integrity of China withiil her
administrative entity, and the signing of the treaty of Portsmouth.
France, the ally of Russia, and Great Britain, the ally of Japan,
proved powerless to even suggest peace. It was. left for the United
States, the ally of neither, to render both and humanity the tran
scendent service. _J

to the above specification. .-:":.- ;
If girls could, only, realize how ridiculous

bear not ,* the~r slightest Vi resemblance ; to
genuine "attractiveness, there : would soon
be a radical change.in /the methods adopt
ed by suitor-hunting; maids and anxious
matchmaking mammas. ""."'.
Why -is is that a young woman
seeks to captivate* a! man she immediate
ly ' begins ;"i to { pose ; .â¢ to -cover up her y real
self, her own', peculiar; nature, by : a^, hun
dred unnatural," foolish, uncalled-for, man
nerisms and superficialities? .'>., : A
Why is : it that'- she must make; such ; a
palpable effort to. please?. Why must she
struggle to be fsonietriing she is not^thus
quenching what vital' spark of magnetism;
sho may; really, possess? ".
' At ithe summer: resorts, where maids
angle for husbands ? as.' frankly-.' as : men
angle for fishi this great' error in' femin
ine tactics is particularly observable.. And
one of the most pronounced results of; this
striving to | charm by; meaningless exter
nals is that the girls; all fall into the same
ways of; talking and acting".
Whatever, manner, of speech is regarded
as most fetching at the time is adopted
by. all alike;, whatever.- little tricks \u25a0; of
manner , seem popular are employed by
every maid anxious -to be considered
'charming. So if it becomes the correct
thing to .mouth one's- words as^ though
mush obstructed utterance no girl Is
satisfied until she has acquired : ithe
breakfast food dialect. Whatever is
smart in the way of a walk, or a smile,
or a nod is Imitated by all just a.s fash-,
ions in clothes are ! allowed. .. .
-\u25a0\u25a0 What is the outcome? Among all -the
array of summer maidens posing for ad
miration, where is a jiote of Individuality
to be found? One is met by a tiresome
uniformity; of expression and action, and
a sameness of personality that palls.
There is no refreshing difference, no stim-.
ulating sense of .individual charm.
'/ When V will women learn that .real
charm is interior; that fascination
springs from within, and that true at
tractiveness has its roots in the soul?.
' The only method -of developing charms
is to.be absolutely true to one's self; not'
to imitate,; but to follow the peculiar pat
tern after /which one's individuality is
fashioned. Every,wo'man should find this
pattern in herself and be true to it, for
its -tracery is wrought, upon her soul as
distinctly as are the delicate lines upon
a leaf or on the petals of a flower."
When a woman departs, from this de
sign; when^she permits the pattern to be
erased, she loses her best self and so says
good-by to real-personal power or mag
netism. When, by being sincere, she de
velops the . tracery, she grows sweet,
strong, attractive, magnetic. â¢ \u25a0 '
Mothers, '': with all 'your training, teach
your* daughters sincerity. Let them con
form to custom in : dress and' certain gen
eral habits,- of course.; But insist that they
regard": the externals' as. of minor im
portance and that they develop the
charm that lies deep.
Girls, whatever you try to be, be -sin
cere. '\u25a0'\u25a0 Drop affectation. Pay more atten

Sister Mary Xavier of Notre Dame

The news of her death will be " the
eource of sorrow- to many women of

alumnae of Notre Dame ' College.
Sister Mary Xavier was ' born . in

Her parents, Robert and Mary Miles,

young. In 1862 : Mary Miles became a
novitiate under the Sisters of Notre
Dame at San Jose. She had been edu
cated "among them and a life of " self â¢:
sacrifice and piety was her desire. In

Si si ter Mary" Xavier came ; to. the Col
lege of Notre Dame in this city . in
1867 and became instructor of phll->
osophy, ' higher mathematics,* Latin and
English. During the absence of the
mother superior she' took" full \u25a0 charge
of the institution; 'Up" to the time she
was smitten by her last illness she re
tained full "'possession of her brilliant
faculties. Not 'only ' for ' her " intellect

SISTER CALLED
TO LAST REST
TWO-TEAR-OLD CHILD WHO SET FIRE TO HIS CLOTHING WHILE PLAYING -
WITH MATCHES IN HIS HOME AND WAS TERRIBLY BURNED. DEATH RE-"
â¢ SULTING AN HOUR AFTER THE ACCIDENT.
L OAIvLAXD, Aug. 30.-Wlth his entire
! body scorched and seared by the flames
of his burning clothing, Paul dc Sachy,
the two-year-old son of Alfred de Sachy,
Â«i painter living at ISBO Seventh street,
died this afternoon at the Receiving Hos
pital after lingering in terrible agony for
more than an hour. The baby had been
P'-aying with matches and in some way
had Â»et his clothing on fire, and the
mother did not discover the peril # of her
. child until it was too- late to save his life.
The baby had been left alone in the
kitchen of the house while Mrs. de Sachy
v.as busy In another room, and in some
vay the child secured part of a box of
matches, with which it was playing. Sud
.denly a scream of agony startled the
mother, and rushing into the kitchen she
found the little one rolling on the floor
with its clothing a mass of flames. Fran
* tic with fear and maddened by the shrieks
of the child, Mrs. de Sachy clasped the
baby In her arms and ran into the street."
: - Fcrcaming for help. The draught caused
by her flight fanned the flre, however,
*'i:nd before aid arrived the baby was so
badly burned that all hope of saving his
life was cone.
Attracted "by the mother's cries for
help, several bystanders rushed to Mrs.
60 Sachy'g aid, tore the blazing clothing
â¢ .from the body of the child and extin
, tjuished the flre. which had communicated
itself to the clothing of the mother. As
the fire in her own clothing was beaten
.out Mrs: de Sachy. overcome by the ter
rible experience through which she had
. ''passed, sank unconscipus to the ground.
V. Little Paul was carried into the house
and Dr. J. M. Kane was summoned to
-â¢'dress his injuries. It was not until the
'shreds of half-burned clothing had been
c stripped from the little body that the ter
rible nature of the burns was revealed,
and Dr. Kane at once ordered the baby
removed to the Receiving Hospital.
As soon as the child was placed on the
operating table the attending Burgeons
knew that all that could be done was to
rr-lieve the atony of the victim until
death released it from Its sufferings, for
ft was so terribly burned from the first
.V 'the case was hopeless. Within half an
* . hour after the baby had been brought to

MISCKLLANEODS M-iRKETS.
XEW YORK, Aug. 30. â A* was to be ex
pected.-the effect of yesterday** historic event
at Portsmouth found clearer reflection on the
stock exchanges of Europe than on our own.
London, Paris an! Berlin reported a vastly
better, tone. Thit was fhown in the improvd
price*- lor Russian arfl Js^janese Issues, ad
vances ta British consols and London's pur
chases-of American eTarities. The universal
gratification expressed i>y financiers Justifies the
belief that America's Interest in an honorable
peace was based on to:r.i?tMng more than eentl
mental grounds. The New York market re
fvsea, however, tr be etccea by those abroad.
It would serve no distinct purpose to specify
tiie day's movements. \ Surnce It to say they
were unimportant as a \u25a0whole and' reflected
FÂ«-neral apathy. The greater part of the day's
of^eraUone were obvloasiy professional, the
etrjy sellir.g movement originating with a
trade- who wps. until rÂ»Â»p-^Jy on tbÂ«.lonsr side.
"*."? lÂ»"ad of an'overnlgM ac*Â«*julation of buy-
Me orders, many commission houses had orders
H sell end the celling Bide of the" market was
taken almost entirely by the trading element.
It U not tc be denied thai the stocks offered
to-day were absorbed wxtn no outward signs
of congestion. At no time was the market
active or broad. The only stock that showed
decided strength in tie opening dealings was
Canadian Pacific. Reading's decline of more
than 2 points Â»ts regarded as quite natural,
in view of the company- s poor showing for
July. Amalgamated Ccpper declined on heavy
tteliing by traders who assumed that the end
of hostilities in the Far East would necessarily
curtail the dematd for the metal. There was
alecran Increased belief tisat the recent specu
lation in mct&ls had reached its limit for a
tine. Other features of weakness were Union
Pacific, 6L Paul. New York Central. Erie.
Louisville and Nat'TViUe, end the United States
Steel lsFUf a. The list drifted along during the
ewljr session, but later, on tts oversold appear
v>ce. traders -went In ana txnight the active
sues bringing p&rtial recoveries in a number
shares and gales in Erie and United States
eel common. Tfce strength of these stock*,
Cther with a 5-point advance in Pacific
'act. were the enly notable features of the
"rtjjCf the market showing weakness at
cc* dose. There were wide differences be
tween London and local prices at the opening
here. London probably took 30,000 shares on
b&ls-Ece. ;â . Â» :
Punior was aralr buÂ«y forecasting the money
i needs of the fornwr belligerents, but In quar
ters where fittalli Â«nould be forthcoming It
was declared that -Jae day had brought no new

[ The New* York circular of J." S. Bache &
'iv. eayp:
"The steel trad* continues satisfactory. Tfc*
]'ig iron market is etrong and an advance to 1
fl5 a ton is expected. Tne fsteel Corporation 1
is in the market for 75.000 tens of pig iron for |
delivery before the end of : the year. Rail or- ,
ders to the extent Â«f 100,000 tons were placed
last \u25a0week, and thÂ« Pennsylvania road is eaid ,
to be in the market for 20H,Â©0<) tons additional. \u25a0
ThÂ« rail rolils are sold up well into the first
half of 19CKV.
The feature of the business situation during
the week has been the steady advance in -the;
price of copper, amounting to Â£3 5s in London
and" five-eighths of a cent a pound in the local .
market. Copper for immediate delivery Is
row 16% c*nts a ;>ound bid and none offered
Â«-t this figure. Corper Bhsres took on some ac
tivity, and scored email advances during the
week. TTf fact thit the official price, of cop
';â¢Â» is 16** cents a pound Is in itself a reason
-*onply sutficJent to Justify much higher prices.
We are again dp winning to hear reports of
tiw enormous weal- a ta the West, sufficient
to sll.-.w ihÂ» financing ot the crops without as
sistance from New York. Money continues
Â«*aÂ«=y here, -but not '-.lng is more certain than
that heavy shlpmerts of money will be sent
to the West: heavier than a year ago. because
the crops are larger. The business situation Is
sound. Prices have reached a high point, but
the public demand for stocks- is such that
there is every indlc* tlon of. & higher level be
ing reached in time "

EDGE GOES
TO NEW BANK
â¢A visit by. Schoor Director Boyle to the
Pacific Heights ; School ' ' has uncovered
what appears to be" a- long-standing fraud
In contract work done for the ; School De
partment in days gone by and gross'care
lessness; on *the ; part of the building ! in
spectors of those days. By the "gradual
shifting. of sand through ; the crevices of
the >'; brick, work ? it -was C found that \u25a0 the
foundation \u25a0 wall was ; hollow.
A cutting was made' into 4 the wall \ for
the purpose of letting \ In ; a window, and
when ?\u25a0 the . first 4 brlck was removed .I a
shower of sand .' poured from the opening.
This | soon - stopped, however, and : on j mak
ing, a larger excavation It was found that
the wall i was ; nothing but . a shellâ a "ver
tical "column^ of I brick, rising one on' the
inside and another on the outside.
'/- Building \u25a0 inspectors were immediately
ordered to report on the safety, of ! the
building, ;as a X heavy flooring was ' : . sup
ported : only \u25a0by the ; two thin facings *ot
brick. The Board* of Health also Investi
gated;, as \lt was : found j that : a '\u25a0-\u25a0 leakage
from the vaults' had collected under j the
planking, making ja' foul lake and * endan
gering the health'of the occupants of ; the
building. ; The {foundation .. Is now under
Investigation, 1 with the purpose of ascer

Jury, aided by an army . of detectives and a

dcavor to admit that It was unable, to find one
wrong that had been committed l by. our hon

UOO words Is one of the grandest vindications
a man ever enjoyed. It reported . that ' abso

The initial meeting of the Union
Labor Party Convention at Lyric Hall
last evening was not an enthusiastic
or spirited gathering. Apart from 'the
presence of the delegates themselves,
the attendance was light. Spectators
in the gallery were not numerous or
demonstrative. The stage decorations,
consisting of three American flags,
were quite acceptable. In the cen
ter of the platform there was "a fairly
good picture of Mayor Schmitz, not.
fully life size, but larger than he may
seem after November' 7. ,'-\u25a0&:
On more than one occasion Orators
P. H. McCarthy of the' thirty-fourth and
James Bowlan of the thirtieth obtained,
the recognition of the chairman. -C. J.
Williams. The incident signified to the
convention that they were prepared ito
talk overtime on any, topic that might
be introduced later on. .
Thomas F. Eagan, chairman of the
Union Labor County Committee, 'opened
the proceedings in a quiet, simple
fashion, giving the delegates to under 7
stand that his pent-up eloquence would
be released to-night at Native Sons*
Hall. The programme provides Â» that
Commissioner Eagan shall' have- the,
special privilege of placing Eugene E.;
Echmitz in nomination for Mayor. .;_
Senator George B. Keane, the Mayor's;
secretary, was among the spectators
at the convention hall. Lincoln Sav
age likewise "graced the occasion"
\u25a0w ith bis presence. A. Ruef, j the real
master of ceremonies, was not visible,
but his skill In - the arrangement of a
programme was ever obvious.
The Citizens' Alliance was. mentioned
but . once, but Chairman \u25a0 -Williams
swatted the late Grand Jury and P. H.
McCarthy made ironical allusion, to
Herbert George. The absence of music
was noted and the fact was observed
that nothing was said in commendation
of President Roosevelt for settling the
strike in Asia. - - .
EAG.O 3IAKES SPEECH.
Chairman Eagan called. ,the ,conven
tion to order at 8:30 o'clock. He raised
but a ripple of enthusiasm by his re
marks, part of which, were as; follows:
An chairman of the United Labor . Party
County Committee. I have the honor to ' call
this convention to order. I will have but little
to say regarding the Issues ot the campaign
before us. but I must. In view of my duty.
pive a brief outline of what I believe we have
fct-semblttl to accomplish. \u25a0'y-r-.-,- "iji^
This beins the fifth convention of the tnlon
Labor party, the dignity of time has \u25a0 been
added to our organisation, but I must say that
this convention Is called under conditions un
like any that ever confronted any other party
jn the history of the city. We all know^tne
purposes for which we have assembled here
and also we know what we must oppose. I
l>eiieve we are all Imbued with the desire to
brins about the bert results possible. We
know what we must meet and on the character
of the battle that confronts us depends the
action ol this convention.
Darius our deliberations here let this battle
that confronts us be carried on In our mind's
eye. that we may be guided thereby. We may
have frictions here, but no matter how zeal
ously you mar strive to attain your personal
desires, remember that we are all here to
\u25a0trive for the success of the ticket that will
be the result of our deliberations.
WILLIAMS CHAIRMAN.
After the calling of the roll, to which
ail but a few delegates responded,
Eagan called for nominations for -tem
porary chairman. H. M. Alexander -of
the Thirty-eighth District, after an
nouncing that be would - name a j man
who. would appeal to the confidence of
every delegate on the â¢ floor, ; placed
Charles J. Williams. of the Thirty-third
District In nomination! Alexander
6trongly_- commended Williams to the
consideration of the convention, but
the ready assent of - the . convention
demonstrated that Mr. Williams*, selec-r
tlon had been prearranged. J. J. Furey
of the Forth-fourth and P. H. McCar
thy, president of the Building Trades
Council, who halls from the Thirty
fourth. ; seconded' the nomination." Frank
Carney of the Twenty-eighth moved
that nominations close and It was so
ordered. Upon motion of â¢ Secretary
George J. Berger of the Forty-third,
Williams was elected by ' acclamation.
The cheering that marked his ascent to
the 'chair was not as â¢ spontaneous ea
that usually given In honor., of a man
that wins a hard-fought contest. . But,
like all programmes, this; one killed
the enthusiasm. Immediately upon his
Belection to. the chair, Williams
.mounted the platform, and' addressed
the convention. In part he said: .
Mr. Chairman, ladles, cenilemen and fellow
4ele*atoÂ»: I thank you -for thÂ« â¢ honor you
haTÂ» conferred upon me by making me tÂ«m- .
poranr chairman of this convention. â¢" For tha
third tlm* la a Mayoralty contest the Union
Labor party comes before the pepple and \u25a0 "will
expect your support. Our ' honored -standard
bearer has be*a true to every pledge and, un*'
der his administration we have bad a govern
ment of equal rights to all. ' - A ' .
