JAPAN NEGOTIATING FOR PEACE
DIRECTLY WITH RUSSIA.
NAMES HER TERMS
Warring Nations May
Become Allies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. ii.â lt was learned to-night that
Japan has sent a suggestion as to peace terms direct to St.
Petersburg, without calling upon the friendly services of
;Â«.ny neutral power. The significance of this is apparent. The
Warring powers, by negotiating directly with each other, will be
enabled to arrive at an agreement under the terms of which they
â¢<rill divide the present war territory in whatever way they choose.
Thus the partition of China will have been effected in spite of
the earnest endeavors of the American State Department to pre
rent it. An alliance of the present foes to prevent interference
â¢rith the terms of their peace compact is one of the probabilities
'of the situation.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
'WASHINGTON*. Feb. 22.â 1t can be
â aid or. very high authority that the
State Department here has received of
ficial information that Japan has in
! bleated that she desires peace in tlxe
Far East, and, while this country has
not been approached through diplo- ,
matic agencies. It is believed that
negotiations have already com- j
menced. Japan's attitude puts the
matter entirely up to Russia. The re
cent events of a revolutionary char
acter in Russia have brought about a
feeling in Washington that Russia's
only course is to accept whatever Ja
pan will offer. As one government of
ficer said to-day:
"It is simply up to Russia now, and
peace can be had if Russia is willing
to use good sound judgment and ex
hibit a manly attitude."
For months it has been the opinion
among the officers of the Government
and diplomats in Washington that
Russia can do naught but declare
peace sooner or later. Japan's latest j
move is considered Russia's great op- i
portunity to end the war ith_sonTe_
degree of honor.
Japan has indicated, it can be said
officially, that the cardinal points of
the treaty of peace with I Russia would
be the evacuation of Korea and the
Integrity of Manchuria. There will be;
of course, many minor details in the
terms of peace, but these two points
will be the main features.
That Port Arthur shall remain In
the hands of the Japanese, together
â¢with the whole of the Llaotung Penin
sula: that the open door prevail at the
port of Vladivostok and that the Chi
nese Eastern Railway be placed under
a neutral international administration
aJso will be points to be agreed upon
In the terms of the treaty.
TRAVERSE CHINESE SOIL.
Russian Raiders Accused of Violation
of Neutrality.
KFR'CHWANG. Feb. 22.â About 300
Russian raiders succeeded in reaching
â¢Lnd slightly damaging the railroad be
tween Haicheng and Tatchekiao on the
tight of February 20. It is alleged by
the Japanese that the Russians, as
they claim was the case in previous
raid?, again violated the neutrality of
Chinese territory west of the Liao
Kiver.
It ie evident that the villagers keep
the Russians well informed as to the
deposition of the Japanese forces. It
expected that the raiders would

destroy the stnres at Niuohiatun. They
retirr-d, however, without <=<> doing and
without engaging the Japanese. The
damape to the railroad was immediate

The raiders mentioned in the fore
joinier dispatches probably belong to

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 22. â It is
explained at the Foreign Office that
the departure from San Francisco of
the three officers of the cruiser Lena
was owing to a misunderstanding.
They had signed a par le not to leave
San Francisco without permission of
the President of the United States un
til an arrangement had been made be

tween Russia and the United States
regarding the Lena was reached, the

LONDON, Feb. 22.â Encouraged by
the reduced Government majority in
the division of the House of Commons
last night, the Irish party unexpected
ly returned to the attack to-day more
fiercely than e% - er. Immediately after
the opening of the day's session John
Redmond gave notice of a motion to
adjourn in order to discuss the ( condi
tion under which Sir Anthony Mac-
Donnell holds the post of under-secre
tary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.
This move came as a surprise and
caught the Government off its guard.
The Speaker set the debate on the mo
tion for the commencement of the
night session.
The debate lasted until midnight,
when a motion to adjourn was de
feated by a vote of 265 to 223; but Red
mond scored a point by compelling
Wyndham, Chief Secretary for Ireland,
to read the correspondence between
himself and Sir Anthony MacDonnell,
by which it as shown that the under
secretary was given extraordinary
powers and authorized to arrange for
co-ordination in the control and direc
tion of boards and administrative
agencies. It was shown also that Pre
mier Balfour had concurred in this ar
rangement.
The reading of the correspondence
between MacDonnell and Wyndham re
vealed that in September. 1902. after
having been offered the under-secre-
taryship, MacDonnell replied stipulat
ing for an "adequate opportunity oÂ£
influencing the policy of the acts of
the Irish administration subject to
your control and your freedom of ac
tion in legislative matters." MacDon
nell specified the points on which he
wished to take action, namely: Main
tenance of order, co-operation of de
partments and education on the gen
eral spirit" of Balfour's views.
The reading of this sentence was
greeted with prolonged Irish cheers.
Wyndham read his reply, which be
gan: "Tour letter was most welcome
to me," and went on to say: "I ac
cept your offer of help on the lines of
the conditions laid down in your let
ter."

Commission's Ruling
Is in Russia's
Favor.
PARIS, Feb. 22.â A semi -official
statement appeared to-night relative to
the work of the International Commis
sion which has been considering the
North Sea incident. It announces that
the commission, in its conclusions,
gives no opinion on the question of the
presence or absence of Japanese tor
pedo boats in the North Sea, merely
declaring that the Russian admiral
quite legitimately believed that his
squadron v.as endangered and that he
had the right, under the circumstances,
to act as he did.
LONDON, Feb. 23.â A strong note of
indignation is. sounded by the London
daily newspapers this morning over
the semi-official statement relative to
the decision of the North Sea Com
mission giving to Russia the victory.
The Daily Mail goes so far as to de
clare the commission has dealt a death
blow to arbitration. Some of the
newspapers blame the Government
strdngly for ever having consented to
subject such a matter to arbitration,
while some of the Government organs
find cold comfort in the fact that the
country by doing so avoided war with
Russia.

OIL INQUIRY
IS CAUSING
UNEASINESS
Certain Members of
Congress Are

â¢ Said to Be Interested in Sub-
Leases oi Osage In

Revelations of the Post office and Land
Fraud Investigations May Be
Surpassed.
Special Dispatch to Tht Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22. â There is a
growing feeling of uneasiness in Con
gressional circles over the investiga
tion ordered by President Roosevelt
of the affairs of the Standard Oil
Company, it is believed this investi
gation will bear as hard on Congress
us it will on the Standard Oil Com
pany and that the revelations of the
Postoftke Department investigation
will be surpassed by those of the oil
fields. The postoffice scandal resulted
in the indictment o f two United States
Senators and the smirching of a large
number of Representatives.
It is said that there are members
of Congress who are interested in the
sub-leases which have been made of
the Osage lands by the oil company,
whose lease is now before the Senate
in the Indian appropriation bill. There
are at least 150 of these minor com
panies, and if members of Congress
hold an interest- in them the disclo
sure will create more than an un
pleasant im:>iossion.
Statements telegraphed from Kan
sas that prominent politicians and
Senators are interested in the Osage
lease are understood to refer to com
panies which are sub-lessees. Whether
the holders of the stock could be held
to be interested in the original lease
is a question for the courts. No one
doubts that if the investigation by
ComtHlSSfisn*eT "**J}frfie"fa should shov/
that members of Congress are inter
ested in the sub-leases the fact will
be made public.
This phase of the inquiry is causing
a great deal of talk in Washington,
especially in view of the fact that in
the land fraud inquiry one Senator
and one Representative and one for
mer Representative have been in
indicted in Oregon. The leasing of
Indiap lands has been an object of
political spoil for many years. The
mining concession on the Uintah res
ervation has already disclosed that
there were many politicians in that
deal. The same thing is said to be
true of the sub-leases in Indian Ter
ritory.
ASKS HITCHOCK TO EXPLAIN.
Texan Brings Up the Osage Oil Lease
In House Resolutions.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â Another
chapter in the Osage oil lease incident
developed to-day when Representative
Stevens of Texas introduced two reso
lutions in the House, addressing in
quiries to the Secretary of the In
terior regarding the Foster lease of the
oil and gas lands belonging to the
Osage Indians. One resolution calls
upon the Secretary to supply the House
with a copy of the Foster lease and
of all sub-leases under that parent
lease, giving the dates of the approval
or rejection and all correspondence on
the subject. The other resolution asks
under what act of Congress the Foster
lease was made, and under what
authority of law the sub-leases were
approved. The Secretary is asked
whether he did not ratify the sub-lease
to the Alameda Company and whether
this was riot the first sub-lease so rati
fied and whether he had not previously
refused to ratify sub-leases.
The resolution asks not only for the
date of the ratification of the Alameda
sub-lease, but also calls for a list of
the officers, directors and stockholders
of the Alameda Company, with infor
mation as to whether any of these per
sons are "personally known or In any
way related to him (the Secretary)
and, if so, the name of such person
and how related."
The resolution directs the Secretary
to say whether he did or did not, on
February 13 last, in a letter addressed
to the chairman of the Committee on
Indian Affairs, write that the Commis
sioner of Indian Affairs "also shows
that there is no necessity for the pro
posed legislation in order to protect the
existing rights of the parties who hold
under the said Foster lease and it is
not deemed advisable, nor indeed would
it be just, to renew and extend the
said lease for a period of ten years or
any other period, without the knowl
edge or consent of the Indians." The
resolution continues:
And If you did write this letter, please state
to the House what Information you have alnce
received that has caused you to recommend
the adoption of the Senate amendment to the
Indian appropriation bill extending said leas*
for ten years on 650.000 acres of said Osage
Indian lands without first securing the con
sent of the Indians.
Trie statement recently given out by
Secretary Hitchcock is cited, in which
he said that "the original Foster lease
was an unheard of monopoly and noth
ing short of a public scandal," and the
resolution asks the Secretary if he was
thus correctly quoted, and if so to state
why he now recommends an extension
of the lease.

INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 22.â The spe

by Speaker Sydney Cantwell of the
House of Representatives, following the
declaration of Representative Ananias
Baker of Fulton and Cass counties,
who in explaining his vote on the anti
cigarette bill in the House to-day pro
duced a letter containing a $100 bill
which, he charged, was sent to him by
those Interested in defeating such legis
lation, to-night issued an affidavit for
the arrest of O. A. Baker of Marion,
a former State Senator, charging him
with having attempted to corrupt Rep
resentative Baker.
The investigating committee, with the
assistance x>t Attorney General Charles
W. Miller, who did the questioning,
wrung from Representative Baker the
name of the ex-State Senator only
after a half hour of persistent and
cleverly planned questioning. Baker
said he- had had to promise the alleged
briber not to divulge his name in order
to draw him out. Detectives are seach
ing for the accused man.
The effect of Representative Baker's
disclosure was apparent in the imme

the Curtis anti-cigarette bill, which
passed by a vote of 74 to 17.

AUBURN, Feb. 22.â "We. the jury,
nereby find Julius Adolph Weber guilty
of murder in the first degree."
This was the verdict rendered this
afternoon after seven ballots by the
jury which has weighed the evidence
in support and against the charge that
Adolph Weber murdered his own
mother. The verdict means that the
boy must hang for the crime. He now
stands branded as the person who
killed his father, mother, sister artd
brother and then sought to hide his
crime by burning the home wherein
their bodies lay.
"I am greatly disappointed but not
discouraged," were the words Adolph
Weber uttered in his cell after the
jury had brought in the verdict. He
took the matter calmly, as he sat in
the court and heard the clerk read the
words that make the gallows his end.
The delay of the jury in bringing in
a verdict led to the belief that there
would be a disagreement as to the de
gree of the crime. Ever since the case
went to thÂ« Jury the people of this
town have been in an excited state,
waiting for the great beil on the court
house to ring, which was to be the
warning notice that a verdict had been
reached.
HELL SOUNDS WARNING.
To-day at 5 minutes after 2, when
the bell rang out in solemn tones,
people from all parts of the community
hurried toward the courthouse. As
the first touch of the bell sounded.
Weber, in his prison, said to his
guardian, John Adams, "Well, I sup
pose that means they have come to a
verdict."
When the murderer walked Into the
courtroom he was calm and placid, as
he has been since the trial began. He
took his seat with his attorneys and
with Sheriff Keena immediately at hfs
back. As soon as the jurors were seated
Judge Prewett announced to the im
mense crowd of spectators that there
should be no demonstration on their
pait no matter what the verdict might
be. A deathlike stillness fell over the
room as the clerk read the following
verdict :
"We. the jury, hereby find Julius
Adolph Weber guilty of murder in the
first degree.
"DEWITT PORTER, Foreman."
WEBER S FACE TURNS PALE.
During the reading of the verdict
Weber's eyes were cast down and his
face assumed an ashy paleness. How
ever, he at once resumed his usual de
meanor, and with a pale, ghastly smile
turned around and spoke to Attorney
Johnson. Judge Prewett then an
nounced that he would pass sentence
on March 13.
The jury was out twenty-one hours
and thirty minutes. Seven ballots were
taken. On the first ballot nine were
for conviction and three for acquittal.
On the second ballot three held out

ST. PAUL, Minn.. Feb. 22.â Traffic oB
Merriam Park car line was badly dtt^
organized for a half-hour this morn-
Ing, all because an absentminded
mother forgot \o take her baby with
her when she left a car. The woman,
whose name is withheld, had been
shopping and at 11 o'clock took a Mer
riam Park car, accompanied by her
four-year-old baby and a number of
packages of bargains. She placed the
baby on a seat beside her and became
so absorbed in problems of dress that
when she arrived at her corner she
forgot to. take the baby with her.
There were several other ladles in the
car, and before the mistake waa dis
covered the car had turned a corner
and the mother was out of sight.
The child appeared to be happy and
contented, but when the car reached
the end of the line and the passengers
ail left, the baby set up a wail which
proved very embarrassing to the con
ductor ami motorman.
Meanwhile the mother had gone to
the Selby avenue station and demand
ed the return of her baby. She was
so excited that the men were unable
to Â»learn the circumstances of the case
and she left the office in a high temper.
She went to the corner and began to
stop every car bound in either direc

boys the street was blocked with cars.
The blockade was finally lifted by
the arrival of the right car. and the
woman left with her baby and strong
words of denunciation against the

REVOLUTION
IN CAUCASUS
Armenians Are Said to
Have Set Up a Form of
Provisional Government
â â â¦
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 23.âAc
cording to mail reports received from
Batoum, racial disorders in the Cau
casus have developed Into actual revo
lution in the cities of Batoum, Pati
and Kutais, at the eastern end of the
Black Sea. under the lead of the
Armenians, who have set up a forth of
provisional government.
Telegraphic communication has been
cut for several days, and it is impos
sible to secure direct confirmation of
these reports, but according to one let
ter the Armenian faction a few days
ago succeeded in making prisoners of
most of the officials and shutting up
the officers and -some of the troops in
the barracks and. aided to some extent
by reservists, in taking the reins of
government into its own hands.
The authorities here and others
familiar with conditions in Caucasus
do not attach great Importance to
these reports, however, as this region
is in a continual state of turmoil, and
if it is true that Armenians have suc
ceeded in temporarily establishing
themselves in the towns named, it is no
Indication of a general revolutionary
movement, but simply another mani
festation of racial feeling between
Armenians and Tartars.

EXHUMED HEAD
SAVES HIS NECK
Montana Lawyer Digs Up
Body and Proves Client Did
Not Shoot From Behind
Social Dispatch to The Call.
LEWISTON, Mont.. Feb. 22.â
Friends of Milton O. Howell, who was
sentenced in 1898 to be hanged for
the murder of Thomas Rozling, which
sentence was afterward commuted to
life imprisonment, are circulating a
petition asking Governor Toole to
pardon him. and scores of signatures
are being obtained. This waa a
"cause celebre" in Montana.
The principals in the tragedy were
neighboring stockmen and the killing
was the result of a quarrel, during
which blows were struck. After the
murder Howell fled to Canada, but
w;is captured and brought back.
The prosecution contended he
killed h 4 s man in cold blood by shoot
ing him from behind. This point waa
bitterly contested by the defense and
an effort made to have the body of
Rozling exhumed in order to deter
mine it. but the court would not or
der it to be done. After the convic
tion and while Howell was under sen
tence of death W. E. Court, his at
torney, himself dug up Rozlings body
without any authority, secured the
head and hurried off to Helena with
it. According to the statement of
certain medical men it showed posi
tively that Rozling was not shot from
behind, as claimed. The startling
exhibit waa shown to Governor Toole
and the death sentence was comÂ«
mut^d.
The attorney's conduct caused in
tense indignation among Rozling's
friends, and threats of having him In
dicted were made, but never carried
out. It is upon the evidence supplied
by the head that the petition for ex
ecutive clemency is now based, and
general belief is that Howell will se
cure his liberty.

night before.
Last night an unmasked man walked
Into a Hood street saloon and forced
the men present to give up their valu
ables. The victims had a good look
at the bold bandit and gave the police
an accurate description. When Mar
fihand walked Into the police station,
he was recognized at once and two of
the men robbed the night before soon
appeared and swore positively to the
identity of the nlprht marauder.

W. McCaffery, engineer in charge of
an eighteen-horsepower boiler in a
building on Furnace street used to
heat several business places, has in
formed the police that about 2 o'clock

woman entered the boiler-room and
while one man covered him with a

package into the firepot on the redhot
coals.
The woman uttered a shriek as he
did so. and one of the men threat
ened her life also. McCaffery says he
heard the scream of a baby as the
package struck the fire. The men
waited several minutes and then
opened the furnace door asain and
raked the bundle about on the coals.
Before leaving the men threatened
to kill McCaffery if he ever revealed
a word of the matter. McCaffery kept
silent until it preyed on his conscience
to such an extent he could keep quiet
no longer. He says he has been un
able to eat or sleep and he is appar

las with joyous hearts and smiling faces they romp and play â when in health I
â and how conducive to health the games in which they indulge, the outdoor
life they enjoy, the cleanly, regular habits they should be taught to form and
the wholesome diet of which they should partake. How tenderly their health
should be preserved, not by constant medication* but by careful avoidance of !
every medicine of an injurious or objectionable nature and if at any time a I
remedial agent is required, to assist nature, only those of known excellence i
should be used; remedies which are pure and wholesome and truly beneficial i
in effect, like the pleasant laxative remedy, Syrup of Figs, manufactured by '
the California Fig Syrup Co. Syrup of Figs has come into general favor in *
many millions of well informed families, whose estimate of its quality and fj
excellence is based upon personal knowledge and use.
Syrup of Figs has also met with the approval of physicians generally, be- !
cause they know it is wholesome, simple and gentle in its action. We inform
all reputable physicians as to the medicinal principles of Syrup of Figs, obtained,
by an original method, from certain plants known to them to act most benefici-
ally and presented in an agreeable syrup in which the wholesome Calif omian
blue figs are used to promote the pleasant taste; therefore it is not a secret rem-
G edy and hence we are free to refer to all well informed physicians, who do not

Please to remember and teach your children also that the genuine Syrup â¢
. of Figs always has the full name of the Company â California Fig Syrup Co. .

DIRT IS FLYING
ON THE ISTHMUS
Substantial Progress Is Be
ing Made in Work of Dig
ging the Panama Canal
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â Reports of
substantial progress in the actual work
of digging the great isthmian canal
were brought to this city to-day by
Canal Commissioners William Barclay-
Parsons and W. H. Burr, who arrived
on the steamer Allianca from Colon.
Professor Burr made the subjoined
statement:
Tho committee on engineering of the
Isthmian Canal Commission report that Ihuy
found the work generally in much better and
more advanced condition than they anticipated.
In the great Culebra cut the detail of con
struction that will take the most time and
most money, the chief engineer has installed
and has at work three large American steam
shovels and is erecting five more. Four thou
sand laborers are now at work on different
portions of the work and 1000 more have
already been engaged in the West " Indies and
Central America. Substantial progress is
therefore being made.
While on the isthmus the commission wu
Jn dally conference with th? chief engineer
with the view of formulating certain plans,
contracts for which can be let at an MUiJ
day. These plans and the accompanying data
will be submitted to the commission at Wash
ington.
At Panama and Colon the laying of sewÂ«rs
and water pipes is progressing steadily, so
that in the near future .both of these cities
will lor the first time be furnished with a
system of sewers and water supply with abund
ance of wholesome water. The presence of
yellow fever is to be regretted, but was to
be expected, as this disease is always present
in tropical countries In America, unless con
tinued sanitary precautions have been taken.
Prior to the sanitary work of the commis
sion no precaution^ or scientific measures have
l> en taken on the tsthmus to guard against
this disease. The same medical officers who
succeeded in eliminating the fever from
Havana are now repeating the crusade in
Panama. Beyond any question equally suc
cessful results will be attained. At the pres
ent ttmÂ« there is nothing approaching an
Â«pidemic and the conditions are greatly im
proved over those of previous years. Some
of the newspaper accounts that have reached
the isthmus from the North were much ex
aggerated.
The commission returned more than satis
fled with the general conditions of the enter
prise and believes that completion can be
attaln-ed in less time than is popularly sup
posed. Some time has of necessity been de
vited by the engineering staff to the study
and investigation of certain details not fully
dterr.nned by the French. This preliminary
work 18 now really ended and the actual work
of construction on a large scale can soon
begin.
Mr. Parsons' attention was called
to the investigation of the affairs of
the Panama Railroad and in the mat
ter of fees said:
"These fees are all right; we all got
them. Corporations pass them. Ten
dollars Is handed each director after
each meeting. They amount to $150 to
$200 a year."
Judge G. F. Little, who will defend
a lottery company's right to sell lot
tery tickets in the canal zone, also
arrived on the Allianca. The case is
on appeal to the Supreme Court of the
United States.

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL. -
Few People Know How Useful It-Is in
Preserving Health and Beauty. ., >- j
Nearly everybody knows that char- !
coal is the safest and most efficient j
disinfectant .nd purifier in nature,' but
few realize Its value when taken into
th<_ human system for the same cleans- ,
ing purpose.
. Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of It the better; it is not a
drug: at all, but simply absorbs the j
erases and impurities always present in j
the stomach and intestines and carries I
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after '
smoking, drinking jor after eating j
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the ;
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels;' it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh. - - â¢ -
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or. another, but probably, the best
charcoal and the most for the money j
is In â  Stuart's ' Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered !
Willow | charcoal . and other harmless i
antiseptics in tablet form, or rather in j
the form of large, pleasant tasting i
lozenges, the "charcoal being "mixed
Tith honey. ' â 
The daily use of these lozenges will
coon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, tweeter breath â  and * purer
blood, and -the beauty of It is. that no
possible harm can result from ;â â  their
continued use. but, on the contrary,
great benefit. ' . ' ';â¢ -V- V . ,
A Buffalo physician. in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says:- "I ad--
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all :
patients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
lon and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver la great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, and, although in â â  some
*erse a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal in
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in
â¢ny of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

MINORITY SENATORS FAVOR
PANAMA ROAD'S ACQUISITION
Gorman and Bailey Indorse the Pro-
gramme Promulgated by the
President. ' " ,-' â '. ." -
WASHrNOTON. Feb. 22.â The Sen
ate to-day considered at some length
the bill providing for Government own
ership of the Panama Railroad. It
was debated freely. Consideration of
the bill was not completed when the
Senate adjourned for want of a quo
rum. Washington's farewell addreA
was read by Perkins at the beginning
of the session.
Morgan took exception to some of
the provisions of the Panama bill,
among them the one authorizing the
deposit of $1,500,000 to facilitate work
on the canal. He saw no necessity, he
said, for employing: a bank for that
service. He considered the provision
as in the interest of some favorite
bank.
Gorman explained that the pro
vision was a matter of convenience.
He did not doubt that the selected
bank would be benefited, but he did
not believe there would be any danger
of loss. Both Gorman and Bailey fa
vored the acquisition of the Panama
Railroad.
Patterson expressed his opinion on
the subject of Government ownership,
saying that he did not regard such
ownership as an unmixed evil. He
favored the acquisition of the Panama
Railroad, as it would enable the Gov
ernment to demonstrate the effect of
national control in such business. Con
tinuing, Patterson said that to call'
President Roosevelt the student of Mr.
Bryan was an injustice, for he believed
both had taken their lessons from the
same source.
HOUSE SENDS ARMY BILL
BACH TO CONFERENCE
Refuses to Agree to the Amendments
Inserted in Measure by the
Senate.
WASHINGTON, Keb. 22.â After a
brief but spirited debate the House to
day sent back to conference the army
appropriation bill. All Senate amend
ments were again disagreed to with
the single exception of one appropriat
ing Jd5.000 for continuing the cable
from Valdez t<> Seward. Alaska. There
was renewed discussion over the pro
vision regarding retired officers with
the militia, the name of General Nel
son A. Miles once more figuring con
spicuously in the debate.
Determined opposition developed to
a motion by Ames of Massachusetts to
agree to the Senate amendment on that
subject which is favorable for the re
tention of full retired pay by General
Miles and other officers of high rank
serving with militia organizations.
A resolution was adopted declaring
it t<> be inexpedient at this time to in
vestigate the legality of the election of
a delegate from Hawaii to the Fifty
ninth CongreFs
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 23, 1905.
REFUSES TO RECONSIDER ITS ACTION
ON SCHOOL APPORTIONMENT BILL
ASSEMBLY, AFTER LONG DEBATE,
PASSES MEASURE TO THE SENATE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 22. â The As
i sembly to-day by a vote of 53 to 22
1 refused to reconsider the Slavin school
apportionment bill. There was an
| other debate, bi^t it was far more mild
i than the stormy discussion of yester
day. There were some caustic re
marks, but the Speaker got through
' without breaking another gavel. Some
words in the way of apology for yes
terday were said. Coghlan remarked
during his address that probably the
, rules of parliamentary ethics, "if not
of parliamentary decency," had been
transgressed. Drew said his remarks,
that had been taken as an insult to
San Francisco, had been miscon
strued. He was only inviting the
children of the metropolis to come out
and get their education under the
murmuring pines and the spreading
â  vines of the beautilul countryside. Be
fore Drew came to his apology, how
; ever, Coghlan had again reverted to
: the Fresno member's statements of
I yesterday.
TAKES SHOT AT FRESNO.
"Such insinuations have never been
made against any locality in this body
before." he said. "Looking back upon
the fifty years of splendid progress
that lie behind San Francisco, I am
willing to make comparisons for the
metropolis with the city of Fresno,
where in the past the streets havÂ«>
been strewn with the dead and the
dying and the pop of the revolver has
sounded in all directions. lam ready
to say that I really think \Jthat city
should have a special appropriation
all to herself to educate her children,
for surely they need special attention
to train their minds from the sights
they have witnessed."
Leaving his picture of the gory
streets of wicked Fresno and her chil
dren swimming to school through rivers
of blood, Coghlan talked on the merits
of the case and said the Assembly
should be unselfish and do only jus
tice.
"We have been told," said Tread-
well, "that there was no use of us de-
bating this question, for no matter
what points were made, the bill would
be carried. From my knowledge of
the personnel of this house I believe
this to be a siander. The proponents
of this bill will have to show before
; they can claim to be acting with an
1 unselfish interest that 5250 is a proper
basis of apportinment and will have to
give a good reason for changing from
I $300, which change gave them the Los
Angeles vote. If any man here is going
1 home to boast to his constituents that
he has brought them some of San
I Francisco's school money, I should
1 hold him beneath a highway robber
who took your money from you in the
dark."
FLING AT GOVERNOR.
Walsh took a fling at the Governor
b t saying that maybe the new appor
tionment was a matter of State poli
tics and that the gentleman who was
doing politics through the bill was not
the State Superintendent of Public In
siruotion. Sufficient votes had been
programmed Ho carry the matter
through the House, he said.
Anthony was given three minutes
in which to talk, and he said among
other things that when this money was
t; ken from San Francisco she would
never get it back.
Manwell said, the bill was a just
measure and that San Francisco owed
to the interior the help that was ex
pected of her. Dorsey also spoke for
the measure, saying it was but right
that the interior counties should get a
larger amount of money with which to
carry on their schools. *
Thus, with a few more personalities,
but with nothing like the rancor or
the disorder of the first day of debate,
tht famous school apportionment bill,
that has produced the most exciting
sctne of the session of the Assembly
thue far, was passed on to the Senate.
MAY COMPLETE MANSION.
House for University President to Be
Considered.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 22.â A bill ap
propriating $15,000 for the comple
tion of the president's residence at the
State University grounds was intro
duced in the Assembly this morning.
If President Wheeler of the university
believes he cannot occupy the mansion
and entertain on the scale required
without financial loss, it is expected
the Regents will either devote the
money now used for rent of the presi
dent's house in assisting him or direct
that the building be used for class
rooms.
The Ways and Means Committee has
given a favorable report on the bill
appropriating $10,000 for an electric
light and power plant at the Lick Ob
servatory.
BERKELEY, Feb. 22. â Concerning
the proposed $15,000 appropriation for
the president's residence, President
Wheeler said:
Thi* appropriation iÂ» Intended to complete
the building In course of construction on the
unlvfrF.lty grounds, which was designed for the
preÃldent'n residence. I did not initiate the
proposal. It comfes as a result of the recent
visit to Berkeley of the legislative commit
tee. The residence, upon which $00,000 has
been expended, is far frcm ready for occu
pancy. Therp Is a question whether It will
be used for the president. I objected to going
into such a large building because of the ex
pense of maintaining It. But that is a mat
ter for the regents to eettle ultimately.
MAY OVERRULE GOVERNOR.
Legislature to Reconsider Bill Reduc
ing Hours of Firemen.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 22_ â Senator
Wolfe will make a fight to pass over
the Governor's veto Senate bill No.
146, the purpose of which is to reduce
the hours of employment of members
of the San Francisco Fire Department
to twelve a day. Senator Wolfe asked
this morning that the question of the
Governor's veto of the measure be
made the special order for next Mgn
day morning. His motion prevailed
and on that day the first effort of the
session to overrule the Governor will
be made.
Senator Shortrldge's bill to protect
the fish and shell fish of California
was finally passed and sent to the As
sembly. This bill goes into the ques
tion of the preservation of fish in all
its phases.
PROTEST FROM REDLANDS.
Fear Bill May Deprive People of Uni-
versity Reports.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 22. â A peti
tion from citizens of Redlands against
the passage of the Gates bill, prohib
iting professors of the State Univer
sity from accepting fees for private
work, was filed in the Assembly this
morning. It states that under the pro
visions of the bill these professors
would be prevented from publishing
reports on fertilizers, which would be
very injurious to the citrus fruit in
dustry. Gates moved that the petition
be not printed In the journal, which
motion was defeated. The petition
was presented by Prescott.
THREE BOODLERS
PREPARE TO FACE
TRIAL FOR CRIME
Recognize That No;
Subterfuge Can
Save Them.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 22.â Boodlers !
French, Wright and Bunkers are pro- j
paring for trial, having abandoned '
hope that their assault on the indict- !
ment, which at first promised so muci, i
will avail aught. Emmons, who lies :
at the point of death as the .-esult of
an operation for appendicitis, naturally ;
has not been told that his associates <
have abandoned hope of escaping trial,
and he will not be for some weeks to i
come, should be survive.
After Attorney Alorehouse had com
pleted his argument on behalf of the
accused, they were highly exhilarated
at the prospect of going scot free, but
they did not count on the fact that a
r<Uy to their argument that they had
committed no crime was to be made
by the prosecution. When this reply
did come their counsel saw that their
defense had crumbled and that ther;
v.*s nothing left to do but to get ready
to convince a jury that the accused are
indecent.
In answer to interrogations by
Judge Hart, District Attorney Sey
mour made the point that it mattered
not whether the Legislature had the
power to investigate corporations or
not; that the acceptance of a bribe on
the part of any member of the Legis
lature from any corporation might in
fluence the vote of such member on
this very question, as a vote might be
called on a resolution to determine
whether or not the Legislature should
delegate to itself the power to investi
gate corporations. The District At
torney also cited authorities establish
ing the fact that the Legislature has
in relation to corporations what is
known as "visiting" powers, which in
clude the right of investigation of any
organization it has directly or indi
rectly created.
The point was also raised by the Dis
trict Attorney that there were various
bills before the Legislature bearing di
rectly on building and loan associa
tions and that the acceptance of a
bribe on the part of a member for
specific action on any phase of the
building and loan association ques
tion would tend to influence such mem
ber in his consideration of all phases
of the question to come before either
or both houses.
The trend of Judge Hart's questions
and the direct manner in which they
were answered and supported by au
thority by the District Attorney dis
pelled all of the high hopes that had
beeen raised by Morehouse's argument,
and counsel for the defense practically
admitted that they were beaten. That
they expect that the court will over
rule their demurner and order the ac
cused to plead next Saturday is made
plain by the statement of one of the
counsel for the defense, who said to
day:
Judge Hart win probably overrule our. c "
murrer. Though he haa given r.o v Intimation
other than what may be gathered from his
questions, we are prepared for an adverse de
cision. But we will go to the Supreme Court,
howtver. and. although this action on our
part will not delay the trial, we have hopes
of ultlmfit? victory on the points raised In th?
demurrer alone..
To-morrow morning Attorney George
D. Collins will argue his motion to
quash the indictment against French.
This will give the court time In which
to investigate the authorities submit
ted in all of the cases before Saturday,
when he will hand down his decision.
- EXPULSION POSTPONED.
Emmons' Illness Causes a Delay in
tlie Proceedings.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 22. â At n late
liour to-nierht it was announced that
consideration of the report of the
committee that has found Emmons,
Bunkers, French and Wright guilty of
bribery and recommends their expul
sion wil" not be taken up to-morrow.
It was agreed that a consideration of
the report at a time when Emmons is
critically ill would look like taking
snap judgment in his case and as
the cases could not be well segregat
ed it was decided iby several members
to recommend that all be postponed.
It is the prevailing opinion that
there will be no objection and that
the hearing will so over for a week.
In the meanwhile the accused Sena
tors will draw their pay and be free
to enjoy all of the rights of the floor.
EMMOTVS IMPROVING.
Physicians Now Believe He Has
Chance of Recovery.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 23.â At mid
night the information was given out
from the bedside of Senator Emmons
that his condition is steadily improv
ing and that there is a possibility of
his recovery- He has no fever and is
resting comfortably.

KRATZ FAINTS
IN COURTROOM
St. Louis Assemblyman. Ac
cused of Bribery, Loses
Consciousness During Trial
BUTLER, Mo., Feb. 22.â Shortly after
entering the courtroom to-day where
he Is on trial on the charge of accept
ing a bribe while a member of the St.
Louis Municipal Assembly, Charles
Kratz suddenly became pale and it was
necessary to assist him into Judge
Denton's; private room, where he lost
consciousness. Mrs. Kratz was with
her husband and a physician was sum
moned! Kratz has been ill for several
months and recently underwent an
operation. The wound has not yet
entirely healed.
The trial was delayed for more than
a half "hour before Kratz again entered
the courtroom. Pie was looking pale
and trembled noticeably as he walked
to his s*at.
Charles T. Gutke, a former member
of the St. Louis House of Delegates,
testified that he went with Kratz to
the residence of Philip Stock and that
the latter asked him to handie the
Suburban bill in the House, but that
ho (dutke) said he could not as there
was a combine of nineteen in the
House, and that he could not act for
all of them, without consulting them.
On the request of Attorney Fauntle
roy, counsel for the defense, an attach
ment was issued to-day for Thomas
K. Niedringhaus, to attend as a wit
ness.
The State introduced in evidence the
small black box from the vaults of the
Mississippi Valley Trust Company of
St. Louis, containing the sixty-one
thousand dollar bills comprising the
bribery fund referred to in the testi
mony brought out in the trial. The
money was counted by the jurors.
William Desmond, chief of detectives
of St. Louis, was the last witness for
the State. He described his trip to
Mexico, when Kratz was brought back
to St. Louis under the provisions of a
special treaty.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Feb. 22.â
The House to-day passed by a vote of
130 tc X what is known as the Silver
bill, which provides that witnesses in
bribery trials shall be Immune from
punishment. The bill was the subject
of a special message from Governor
Folk and a similar measure was de
feated in the Senate. Governor Folk
will, it is said, bring pressure to bear
in an endeavor to pass the Silver bill

country what ; It I* and it . now remains to us
and to our , children to make- the American
nation not the equal, a* it now ie, but the

modern, building dedicated to learning and
education.

I ; When, a few years ago we first learned that
Mr ' Carnegie . wpi> about to donate from his

country we little thought that he would recog
nize such .an - obscure town as this -of ours.
But we have found-to our great joy that It all
rested", with .ve â we needed but to ask and he
glsdly and cheerfully responded. :
:-.. :Wei' found that â¢it was not his purpose to
build libraries In -the great 'cities alone, but
wherever the people should ; desire and need
on*. To. htm â we give our heartfelt thanks'
â  and we hope to construct here upon this site
a building. which will prove not only a benefit
to " our town ' and "community, but a ' suitable
' mT.umont to htm. â  '

GRAND AKMY VETERANS
DISCUSS COTTAGE PLAN
George H. Thomas Post, Grand Army
Of the Republic, met recently and
discussed the subject of a contribu
tion in aid of the building of^ a cottage
at either of the Soldiers' Homes of this
department, for occupancy by veteran
and wife. In the discussion it was
shown that the old soldier in going to
a home fur the care of veterans is com
pelled to leave his aged and Infirm
wife at the gate of the reservation.
In the Grand Army posts these scenes
of pathetic separation are vividly de
picted to comrades, and there is a
growing sentiment in favor of a rule of
r.rlmission to homes that will allow
husband and wife who have "wintered
and summered" together for two score
y^ars to go hand in hand until the
journey on this sphere ends for one or
the other. In some of the Eastern
homes, notably the Soldiers' Home
maintained by Indiana, the old couples
who have fought the battles of life to
gether are permitted to dwell in each
other's company at the State institu
tion.
It is claimed by leading men of thf
Grand Army that CaMfornla's policy of
dealing with institutions for the care
of the insane, the feeble minded and
criminals should not be applied to
homes for the care of disabled volun
teer soldiers and sailors. The State, it is
said, derives three-fifths of the money
for the support of such homes from the
Federal Government. Moreover, the
Grand Army men Insist that the allow
ance for support of veterans is not a
charity but an obligation. Mention Is
made of the fact that President Lin
coln pledged the faith of the nation
that the survivors of the great con
flict should be cared for.
It is predicted that the ideal home
for the shelter of old veterans will be
established in California, and that the
Government will provide the most if
not all the means for its support.
Meanwhile it is proposed by the Grand
Army postÃ of the Department of Cal
ifornia and Nevada to agitate the sub
ject of broadening the policy of the
State in reference to methods of man
agement.

Upset of Holiday Quiet
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1015 Broadway, Feb. 22.
Like a farce comedy plot was the
experience to-day of Mrs. George Cook,
a guest at th* Glen wood Hotel, la her
effort to .take as . afternoon holiday
drive to San Leandro. Mrs. Cook en-
Joyed the outing, but very innocently
set the detective department at police
headquarters by the ears, caused two
stable owners much worry and spoiled
Dr. E. A. Upton's day of rest from
professional troubles.
Act 1 In the tale of mishaps opens
with Mrs. Cook ordering a horse and
buggy sent to the Glenwood from tike
City Hall stables. Mistake No. 1 oc
curs when the rig is sent to the Hotel
Metropole. Almost simultaneously Dr.
Upton had telephoned to Gates' stable
for a horse and buggy. The v
was sent as ordered to Fourteenth and
Washington streets, and in front of the
hotel where Mrs. Cook was waiting
with a friend. She phoned to the City
Hail stables and was told the buggy
had been sent as directed. Seeing the
team standing in front of the hotel.
Mrs. Cook and her friend took posses
sion of it. and away the pair went
toward San Leandro.
When Dr. Upton appeared to claim
the outfit it had disappeared. He
rushed to the police and d<?tÂ»cttves
were hustled out. Th-y got a clew
that two women had purloined the
missing vehicle. Down the San Lean
dro road, guided by description, the
detectives hurried, but did not over
take the women. They had a beautiful
time. Coming home Mrs. Cook drove
through Thirteenth street, passing
Gates' stable. A hoatler noticed th?
rig. recognized it and summoned the
occupants to account. Explanations
were in order, and the missing ye
was turned In after ample apology.
The detectives returned from the pu.
sult. Dr. Upton wonders whether he
has had a good time celebrating Wash
ington's birthday.
WHEELAN TALKS

Better Classes Shirk Polls
ALAMEDA, Feb. 22.â Political condi
tions and the lack of civic pride on 1 the
part of the better class of " citizens of
San - Francisco were Incidentally dwelt
upon by Fairfax H. Wheelan of that
city In an .address on "Democracy's
Needs and . the People's Neglect." de
livered : under the auspices of the
church club of Christ's Church In
Parish Hall to-night. In part the
speaker said:
Whan wo neglect our etrlfl dutlM our city.
State and nation begin to a*Â«rradÂ» and disin
tegrate. No Government * e*n rlsÂ« abovs It*
people and officials in merit. ' Virtue and cor
ruption i cannot be linked together. Liberty,
when once : lost " through debasement of char
acter. Is never regained. We have r bees - de
prived of a large part of our political heritage
by bosses who are despots, responsible to no
law â  and as venal as Judas Iscaiiot. : Â«â¢
â¢ At our Important bond . election In San Fran
cisco but 40- per cent of the citizens . took
enough Interest . to vote, and at th* primary
election held in August less than 40 per cent
of ; the .: registered - voter* â¢ went â¢ to the polls.
Conspicuous among . these was every boa*,
ward heeier * hop-head, degenerate, thief an*.
criminal. â â¢ who was â¢ looking for something -or
working for boodle. These foes to decency,
honesty - and Justice â¢ labored from â  early morn-
Ing â¢ until â¢ late at . night, while 60 . per cent â¢of
the : citizensâ and they were, nearly all â of th*
better â did not muster civic pride enough
in their municipality to even go to th* polls.
How would a business house get . itself rated

PRESIDENT INTRODUCED.
At the conclusion of the ceremonies
President Harrison made a few brief
introductory remarks and President
Roosevelt delivered his oration. He
said:
As a nation we have had our full share ft
great men. but the two men of pre-eminent
greatness who. as the centuries fro on. will
surely loom above all others are Washington
and Lincoln: and it is peculiarly fitting that
their birthdays should be celebrated every
year and the meaning or their lives brought
home close to us.
Xo other city in the country is no closely
identified with Washington's career a* Phila
delphia. He served here in 1775 in the Con
tinental Congress. He was here as comman
der of the army at the time of the battles
of Brandywlne and, Germantown; and it was
near here that with that army he faced the
dtsolate winter at Valley Forge, the winter
which marked the turning point of the Revo
lutionary War. Here he came again â¢Â«* pres
ident of the convention which framed the con
stitution and then as President of the United
States, and finally as lieutenant general of the
army after he had retired from the Presidency.
One hundred and eight years ago. just be
fore he left the Presidency, he issued h!s
farewell address, and In it he laid down cer
tain principles which tie believed should guidt
the citizens of this republic for all time to
come. hiE own words being, "wfcjch appear ie
me all-important to the permanency of your
felicity &s a people."
TWO CwKKAT AMERICANS.
Washington, though in some ways an even
greater man than Lincoln, did not have
Lincoln* wonderful gift of expression that
pi ft which â .akÂ«-f- certain speeches of the rail
splitter frcm Illinois read like the inspired
utterances of the great Hebrew seers and
prophet* But hÂ» had a!! of Lincoln's sound
cemxnon ii en far-a(frhte4nees ano devotion
to a lofty ideal. Like Lincoln he 'sought after
the noblest objects and like Lincoln he eought
after them by thoroughly practical methods.
These two greatest Americans " car. fairly
be called the best among the great men of
the world, and greatest among the good men
of the world. Each showed in actual prÂ» -
tice his capacity to secure undei our system
the priceless urion of Individual liberty with
povernrnenral rtreesth.- Each was as free frcn-.
the vieÂ«- of the tyrant as from the vices of
the demagogue. To each the empty futility
of the mere doctrinaire was as alien as the
baseness of the merely self-seeking politician.
Each mas Incapable alike of the^kickedne*R
which seek* by force of arms to wrong others
&ad of the no letÂ» criminal weakness which
fails "to provide effectively against being
wronged by others.
Among Washington's maxims which he be
queathed to bis countrymen were the two
following "Observe good faith and Justice
toward all nations" and "To be prepared for
war Is the most effective meant to promote
j>eacÂ«." These two principles taken together
should form the basis of our whole foreign

portant o.' the principles which Washington
laid down for the guidance of his countrynu-n.
HIS BTAKD I OR JIbTHK.
Ncr was Washington the only one of our
rreat Presidents who showed far-fcixnted pa
triotism by support of the navy. When An
drew Jackson wan in Congress he voted for
the first, warship* we ever built as part of
our regular navy; and he voted against the
grant ot money to pay our humiliating tribute
to the pirates of the Barbary (tates. Old
Hickory was a patriot through . and through,
and there was not an ounce of timidity in his
nature, aM of course he felt only indignant
contempt for a policy which purchased lan
ignoble peace by cowardice stead of exacting
a just peace by showing we were as little
willing to submit to &n to inflict -aggression.
Had a majority of Jackson's colleagues and
tuccessors felt asÂ« he did about the navy' had
It-been built up instead of being brought" to a
standstill. "it would probably never Imve been
necessary to Octal the war of ISI2.
Asain Washington said": "Give to mankind
the example of a people always guided by an
exalted justice and btnevolence." This feel
ing can be shown alike by our dealings within
and without our own borders. Taft and Wright
in the , Philippines and Wood in Cuba have
shown us exactly how to practice this justice
and benevolence fn dealing with other peoples â
h juttice and benevolence which can be shown,
not by shirking our duty and abandoning to
self-destruction those unfit to govern them
selves, but by doing our duty by staying with
them and teaching them how to govern them
selves, by uplifting them spiritually and ma
terially. Here at home we are obeying this
maxim of Washington's just go- far as we
nelj> in every movement, whether undertaken
by the Government -or as is. and should be,
more often the case,' by voluntary action
among private citizens for the betterment of
our own people.
HIS OTHER TEACHINGS.
Observe that Washington speaks both of
justice and benevolence, and that he puts
Justice first. We must be generous, we
n.ust help our poorer brother, but above all/
v.c must remember to-be just; and the first
â tap toward securing justice is to treat every
mar. on hi* worth as a man, showing him no
special favor, .but m. far as may be holding
open for him the door of opportunity so that
reward may wait upon honest and intelligent
endeavor. -
Again Washington paid: "Cherish public
credit." Just a: the â  moment there is no at
tack on public credit, but if ever the tempta
tion arises again let our people at the outset
remember that the worst because the most
infidious form of the appeal that would make
a mar. a dishonest debtor Is that which per
ruades him ; that it is anything but dishonest
for him to repudiate his debts.
Finally, it is peculiarly appropriate, when
I have come to this city as the guest of the
University of Pennsylvania, to quote another
of Washington's maxims: "Promote, as an
object of primary importance, institutions for
th. general diffusion of knowledge. In pro
portion as the structure of a government gives
force to public opinion, it is essential that
public opinion should be enlightened." Edu
cation may not make a man a good citizen,
but most certainly ignorance tends to prevent
his being a good citizen. Washington was far
too much of a patriot, had far too much love
for his fellow citizens, to try to teach them
that they could govern themselves unless they
could develop a sound and enlightened public
opinion. No nation can permanently retain
free government unless it can retain a high
average of citizenship; and there can be no
such high average of citizenship without a
high average of education, using the word In
it.- broadest and truest sense $o include the
things of the soul as well as the things of
the mind. - -r.,;. : uÂ» . â¢.Â»
VALUE OF EDUCATION.
School education < an never supplant or take
the place of self-education, still less can It
ir. any way take the place of those rusrged
pncl manly qualities which we group tognhet
ur.rier the name of character: but it can be
â  mous use in supplementing both. It
is a source of juet pride to every American
that our people have so consistently acted in
accordance with Washington's principle of
pi â muting institutions tor the diffusion of
knowledge. There in nothing dearer to our
hearts than Â»ur public sohoo; system, by
â¢rfclch free primary education is provided for
every one wi'hin our border?. The higher
â  on. such as is provided by thr \ni
ot Penn*.y!van!a and kindred bodns. net
treat benefits to thoee able to
take advantage of it, but entails upon them
â  MKling uuties.
The men who founded this nation had to
deal with theories of government and the
fundamental principles of free institutions.
We are now concerned with a different set of
questions, for the republic has been firmly
established, its principles thoroughly tested
and fully approved. To merely political issues
have succeeded these of grave social and
economic importance, the solution of which
demands the best efforts of the best men. We
have a right to expect that a wise and leading
part in the effort to attain this solution will
be taken by those who have been exception
ally blessed in . the matter of obtaining an
education. That college graduate is but a
poor creature who does not feel when he has
left college that he has received something
for which he owes a return. What he thus
owes he can as a rule only pay by the way
he bears himself throughout life. It Is but
occasionally thai a college graduate can do
much outright for his alma mater; he can
best repay her by living a life that will re
flect credit upon her, by so carrying himself
as a citizen that men shall see that th" years
spent In training him have not been wasted.
The educated man is entitled to no special
privilege, save the Inestimable privilege lof
trying to show that his education enables him
to tako the lead in striving to guide his fel
lows right in the difficult task which Is set
to us of tbe twentieth century.
The problems b?fore us to-day arÂ« very
â¢ x. and are widely different from tlioee
which the men of Washington's generation
had to face: but we can overcome them surely,
an": w^ cs>n overcome them only. If we ap
proach them in the spirit which â Washington
and Washington's great supporters brought to
bear upon the problems of thÂ«lr day â the spirit
of sanity and of courage, the spirit which com
t.ines hard common sense v.-jth the loftiest
ldf alism.

B^^m Ã^Sf l^^^?. ra Â« CALIFOR â¢ HHGIMENT CARRIED
BATTLE FLAGS GIVEN OVER
TO KEEPING OF THE STATE
Cherished Colors Presented to the Governor at Sacramento
by the Men of the First California Regiment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 22. â With a
setting of gold braid and glittering
blades and the blare of martial music,
the war-worn flags carried by the First
California Regiment through the strife
in the Philippines were presented to
the State of California to-day. The
presentation took place in the Assem
bly chamber before as large a throng
as could be accommodated, the mem
bers of the Senate, the Assembly and
the Governor and his staff all being
present.
Shortly before noon the Second Cali
fornia Regiment of Sacs*tmento, In
command of Major Zittinger, Colonel
Seymour being with the Governor's
staff, entered the Assembly chamber,
acting as an escort, and formed. In a
semicircle about the sides and rear. A
little later the Lieutenant Governor
and the members of the Senate, with
Secretary Louis Hilborn and Sergeant
at Arms Lew Martin at their head, en
tered the chamber and were welcomed
by Speaker Prescott. The Senators
took seats provided for them with the
Assemblymen. At noon Sergeant at
Arms John Stafford of the Assembly
announced the Goverpor and his
staff, and the chief executive, followed
by his glittering official escort, march
ed down the aisle to the desk.
The two flags, the regimental colors
and the Stars and Stripes, were car
ried down the center by Color Ser
geants E. H. Levy and J. J. Brady,
Color Guards Bonnell and Emile Ber
toe accompanying them. All are vet
erans of the Spanish war.
Colonel George Filmer of the First
California Regiment introduced Chap
lair. Joseph McQuaide. who had been
chosen to make the presentation
speech. Chaplain McQuaide said:
This ia the last and most peaceful act In
connection with the Spanish war of the First
California Volunteers who served under these
battle-worn flags. They have ohoÂ»en me, their
chaplain, for. this service, I being the most In
clined for peace- of any of them.
We did not decide to give the flags up un
til alter a struggle. They were our inspira
tlon over there, thousands of miles from home.
Some thought it better to keep them In the
meeting: room of the regiment In San Fran
cisco, where they would always be a matter
of ptide to us. and where those who came
after us would look upon them as precious
emblems. We decided, though, that Califor
nia was bigger than San Francisco, and that
we should part with them.
From these flags those who come later will
learn that with all the inordinate struggle
for wealth and civic honors of the times,
young men, more than needed, may be found
to quit the peaceful avocations of life and go
forth at their country"s call to battle for her.
Governor Pardee, in responding-,
said the State of California was under
many obligations for the gift of the
flags that had been carried under the
tropic suns by the first troops Cali
fornia had sent to fight for her coun
try in the Spanish war. It .had been
said sometimes, he added, that the citi
zen soldiery was not worthy the sup
port of the nation. Here, in the pres
ence of such a scene, such statements
fell almost beneath contempt. The
Governor, in conclusion, said:
I assure you that the flags presented here
to-day will be held in reverence, and that the
giving- of them will be looked on as a sacrifice
on thÂ« part of the First California Regiment.
Tour valorous deeds will not be forgotten.
As the flags were being: taken out
to be placed in the adjutant general's
office the band played "The Star-
Spangled Banner."
The officers of the First California
who participated in the ceremony were
Colonel Filmer, Lieutenant Colonel T.
J. McCreagh, Major John F. Eggert,
Captain and Adjutant H. G. Matthew
son, Captain Herbert Choynski, Cap
tain William Weiser, Chaplain Mc-
Quaide, Captain S. O. Beaeley and
Lieutenants William Corcoran. F. W.
Hammond, H. G. Stinal, L. J. Swift, E.
F. Peckham, L. Graham, Fred Bert
retnd and J. G. O'Har*a.
TRIBUTE TO WASHINGTON.
Appropriate Ceremonies Held by the
State l/egislatnre.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 22. â Dirnifled
ceremonies, commemorative of the an
niversary of the birth of George Wash
ington, were held in the Assembly
chamber this evening. The chamber was
decorated with ferns and flags for the
occasion and a picture of the first
President of the nation was hung be
hind the Speaker's chair.
The call to order was made "**y
Speaker Prescott. This was followed
by the announcement of the arrival of
Governor Pardee, accompanied by the
Senate. After the Binging of Keller's
"American Hymn" by the Orpheus
Quartet the invocation was pro
ncunced by Rev. George E. King,
chaplain of the Assembly.
Lieutenant Governor Anderson, who
was to deliver the opening remarks,
was unavoidably absent. Senator W.
FJ. Ralston took his place on the pro
gramme and â¢ read extracts from
Washington's first message to Con
gress.
Assemblyman Frank R. of
Vallejo spoke on "Our President" He
asked his audience to imagine, if It
could, how such a subject as "Our
President" would be received by the
millions of subjects of Great Britain,
the ruled masses of Germany or the
downtrodden hordes of the great Mus
covite power, whose head is now bow
ed in humiliation and despair. Such a
subject, he said, if baaed on the reali
zation that indeed liberty was theirs,
as It is ours, and that monarchial gov
ernment was at an end, would raise
them to higher aims and progress.
would break its schackles and the
world would move on to the greater
destiny the future holds for all man
kind. Roosevelt, he said in conclu
sion, was a man whose character
would stand as an example for the
aspirations of future generations and
well we might be proud to say of him,
"Our President."
H. Weinstock was given the subject
"California." He said he wondered
how many of our people appreciate the
fact that this State is the gem of all
that make up this, the greatest nation
In history. Washington, he said, never
dreamed of the great empire that lay
by the western sea, where summer is
eternal and want unknown. "Truly we
are the favored of God," he said in
conclusion, "and his chosen people."
Assemblyman George A. McGowan
spoke on the character of Washington.
He analyzed the career of the great
American, and recited facts of history
that prove that it was his patriotism
and courage that gave to us the free
dom that has made the nation what it
Is to-day.
Senator Charles M. Shortridge de
livered an effective address on "Our
Country." He said he challenged the
world to produce a country that had
started on Its great career with such
high purposes, that had fulfilled them
so well, a country that was born for
human rights that had so well main
tained them. Taxation without repre
sentation, he said, still exists in a
measure, but he hoped that this will
soon end. This was a reference to the
denial of suffrage to women. They
caught the point and Senator Short
ridge was warmly applauded. In con
clusion he said no hand but that of
God could stay the majestic march of
liberty so well exemplified in the his
tory of our land.
Assemblyman M. Estudlllo spoke elo
quently on "Our Flag." after which tfce
audience joined In "America," the
closing number.

SEALS FRIENDSHIP
OF TWO NATIONS.
UNVEILS BUST OF WASHINGTON
FRENCH EMBASSADOR PRESE.YTS
HIS PEOPLE'S GIFT TO AMERICA
WASHINGTON. Feb. 22.âEmbas
sador Jusserand to-day presented to
Congress the bronze replica of the
original marble bust of George Wash
ington, which \yas destroyed by fire
in thfe library of Congress in 1851. The
ceremonies took place in the rotunda
at the Capitol, where the bust was
unveiled, and in the President's room
in the Senate wing, where speeches
were made by the Embassador on be
half of the French donors and by
Senator Wetmore of Rhode Island
and Representative McCleary of Min
nesota on behalf of the two branches
of Congress, President Pro Tern.
Frye of the Senate presided.
Madame Jusserand drew aside the
veil which exposed the replica and its
garlanded pedestal. This act provoked
the only applause of the ceremony.
The French Embassador placed in
a receptacle of the pedestal documents
containing a history of the bust and
announced that the acceptance by the
United States of the gift from France
sealed eternal the friendship between
the nations.
Senator Wetmore read a resolution
adopted by Congress â  accepting the
gift and the * Embassador, delivering
the speech' of presentation, said: -
â A great' nation never forgets the great deeds
and great â¢ examples of Its ancestors, and no
man, indeed, in any country .. better deserves
grateful remembrance, than George Washington.
He was. in truth, ' a providential man: no
other of your great men would hayÂ« been able
to do as well what he did: and he, appear
ing at any other period of your history, would
not have proved such a useful citizen. He
would not, perhaps, have fulfilled Lincoln's
task so well, but he fulfilled Washington's
the. noblest that could be imagined. The no
blest, for the - question then was one of the
life -or death: the question was to know
whether the attempted revolution would prove
the cradle, or grave of 'American liberty.
For his mighty task he had all the. needed
and rarely united qualities: Patience, which
was not inaction; - â¢ readiness and fortitude,
which were- not temerity; calmness, which was
not indifference: kindneas, which was not
weakness. " Far above all the rtst, his sound
ness of . heart, of m'nd. cf seaÂ«Â». An 4 tli^s
soundness of judgment taught him that there
are occasions when one can never be patient
enough and -others when one can never be bold
enough. Seme of his move* are amr.c? the
boldest on record, as when, at such an early
date as thÂ« first of August, 1774. he declared
himself ready to raise 20.000 men. to equip
them and lead them to the rescue of Boston:
SONS OF REVOLUTION HONOR
THE BIRTHDAY OF WASHINGTON
Members of California Society Give
Banquet at St Francis Hotel.
In the style befitting the simplicity
and yet the elegance of George Wash
ington, the California Society of Sons
of the American Revolution held a
banquet last night In honor of the one
hundred and seventy-third anniver
sary of his birth. The reception, din
ner and speechmaking took place in
the handsome banquet rooms on the
mezzanine floor of the St. Francis Ho
tel, where were gathered the members
of the society and their wives and
sweethearts, many of whom are mem
bers of the Daughters of the Revolu
tion.
The reception began at 6:30 and
lasted until 7, when the banquet march
began. As the guests gathered about
the daintily laden tables all Joined in
singing "America," after which the
feasting began. During the dinner pa
triotic music was played and many ap
propriate selections were given by the
Knickerbocker Quartet. Back of the
president's chair and draped by two
American flags was a large picture of
Washington and flags draped through
out the rooms completed the beautiful
color effect.
The president of the society, A. G.
Eells, who acted as toastmaster, gave
the opening address. Taking as his
subject "The Day We Celebrate," he
spoke interestingly of Washington's
life and history and told of the com
memorations of his birth through vari
ous epochs of the republic.
The next speaker was Frank J.
Symmes, who told of the lives of the
Presidents of the United States and
their duties. He said that no greater
honor to the Presidents or to ancestors
of the Revolutionary period could be
paid by the present generation than
for each American citizen to do his
duty in his allotted place. Mr. Symmes
declared that at present the city was
disgraced and dragged in the dirt and
It remained for the present generation
to do Its duty In civil life as our an
cestors did theirs in time of war.
A pleasant feature of the gathering
was the speech of Mrs. George Law
Smith, who told In glowing terms of
the Influence of wife and mother upon
Washington, and of the lives and work
of the other women of Washington's
family.
H. D. Loveland spoke of trne> great
ness and compared the useful and up
lifting careers of Washington, Colum
bus and Newton with the selfish
though magnificent successes of Alex
ander, Caesar and Napoleon. Samuel
M. Shortridge finished the speechmak
ing with an apt and interesting oration
on "Washington. " At the conclusion
of the evening the entire company rose
and sang "The Star-spangled Banner."

English Welterweight Champion Will
Endeavor to Lower Colors of
Joe Thomas.
One of the best amateur boxing
shows held in this city for many a
moon will take place to-morrow night
at Woodward's Pavilion under the
auspices of the Hawthorne Club. The
main event between Joe Thomas, the
pride of the Brooklyn Club, and Jack
Mclaughlin, the champion amateur
welterweight of England, gives prom
ise of being a whirlwind go. Thomas'
ability is well known here and Mc-
Laughlin is said to be better than any
amateur now fighting in this city.
Lew Powell and Gus Salisbury will
meet in one of thr special events.
Powell is admitted to be one of the
cleverest lightweights on the coast,
but he will meet a big man in Salis
bury, so a rough mill is expected.

en most of the little fellows, will at
tempt to lower the colors of Jack
Murray, the champion 115-pound

of light heavies, will go four rounds.

matched, as are Bob Cairns and Nob
by Otts and Young Dempsey and
George Ranfranson. Jere Dunn, the
famous New York sporting man, will
be one of the judges. Eddie Smith of
Oakland will referee all the bouts.

IX THE OPEN'IWO MEET OF THE
SEASON.
The bluerock season was opened yes
terday at the Ingleside traps with a
joint shoot of the Golden Gate and
T*nirÂ»n Gun clubs. Many gunmen were
r>n hand and with the favorable
weather conditions it was an auspicious
opening. Despite several months of
inactivity the gunmen were in good
form and some high scores w*re made.
The weather conditions for such shoot
ing could not be improved upon, as
hardly a breath of wind was blowing
to interfere with the course of the
targets after they left the traps.
Five events were down on the pro
gramme. In the first event at fifteen
targets. Otto Feudner made a clean
score of fifteen bluerocks. Several of
the competitors succeeded in getting
all but one bird. Holling. Haight,
Slade and Sears were tied for first
honors in the fifteen bird class shoot.
Kach made clean scores. Reed and
Sylvester succeeded In breaking twenty
birds each in the Rose system shoot at
twenty birds. Schultz and Reed made
the good scores of fourteen birds each
in the reverse system shoot at fifteen
hluerocks. Varien and Klevesahl
brought down twenty birds in the En

NEGRO PASTOR
TALKS TREASON
S;n s Xo Great Harm Would
Rp Done if Bomb Were
Hurled at the President
NEW YORK. Feb. 22.-Criticism of
Booker T. Washington and incidentally
of President Roosevelt by the Rev. Di.
Charles 6. Morris in the Mount Olivet
Baptist church (African), in West
Fifty-third street, caused a great up
roar last night among 1 a large audience
of negroes. Dr. Morris is the pastor
of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. His
remarks, which were frequently Inter
rupted, brought hisses and cries of
"outrage!" Later he was denounced by
a number of clergymen and laymen.
A committee was appointed to hale
Dr. Morris before it and ask him to
retract.
Dr. Morris declared Booker T. "Wash
ington to be a coward in his way and
Thai Fince he had become prominent
â¢.egro leader five Southern States
pfranchised colored voters.
When the speaker declared that no
gTeat harm would have been done if an
anarchist had made an attack when
Washington visited President Roose
velt at the White House, excitement
reached a high pitch. Several of the
colored men on the platform started
toward Morris as if to protest, and he
quickly brought his speech to a close.
To-day it was denied by friends of
the pastor that he had said no 'great
harm would have been done if an an
archist had dropped a bomb under the
table when President Roosevelt and
Washington were dining together in the
White House. Dr. Morris claimed that
he had merely quoted the language of
a campaign orator last fall to show
that Washington was unpopular.

PROVES THE CLEVEREST OF JUMPERS
Sensational Sport Is Provided by California Polo and Pony Racing Meet
BXCTTING FINISH OF ONE OF THE FLAT RACES AT THE CHARITY MEET
HELD ON THE TN'GLESIDE RArEOOVRSE A.YD A PROMINENT CAN
rJIOATE FOR HONORS fN THE STEKPLET-HAPE.
Francis J. Carolan's Fusilade Proves Too
Fast for Distance Ponies.
Ingrleside race course never looked
brighter nor gayer than it did yester
day when its gates swung open under
the auspices of the California Polo and
P<>ny Racing Association in the name
of charity. The attendance was the
largest ever attracted by the pony rac
ing, being sufficiently large to give life
and color to the racing scene. The club
house verandas were filled with well
known members of the smart set and
for the moment horse was king.
The steeplechase through the n>ld
was expected to supply the thrill and
it did so in a marked degree, two of
the four riders being thrown in a spec
tacular manner, but miraculously eÃ
caping Injury. The bie sixteen
hand banters made a striking picture
on their way to the post after the
spectators had become accustomed to
the smaller racing ponies.
Th^rp was one false break and th<>n
the quartft was sent away to an even
start. Frank Skinner, sporting the cop
per colors of C. W. Clark, at once
showed in front. The horses all seemed
to fence well at the first Jump, but Sir
James Powers, who rode F. J. Carolan's
Quedado, was unseated at this early
staire of the race.
STEEPLECHASE RIDER THROWN".
He was thrown out on his mount's
neck and hung there for a moment.
He tried to regain his seat while the
horre was galloping, but failed and
tumbled off in the soft sand. He fell
in front of F. J. Carolan, on Spectator,
and threw the latter horse out of his
stride. The remaining contestants
made a complete circuit of the field,
taking all the Jumps, Including the
water, in good style. Mr. Carolan drew
up gradually on Frank Skinner and
they took the first fence on the second
circuit of the track together.
As Mr. Carolan took the Jump in
front of the stand his horse struck
the fence and threw his rider heavily
to the ground. A cry of horror went
up, involuntarily, from the spectators.
Mr. Carolan retained his presence of
mind and gamely stood up and moved
his hands to show he was uninjured.
He was able to leave the course un
assisted.
In the meantime Frank Skinner was
sending his mount along in clever
style, horse and rider seeming to un
derstand one another thoroughly. In
the last half mile Cyril Tobin brought
Vanity up to within a few lengths of
the flying leader, but the big horse,
which once carried the colors of Ed
Corrigan, was not equal to the task,
being beaten ultimately ten open
lengths.
The winner Is a brown mare which
was bred In Ireland, the "home of the
Jumpers, and was purchased by Mr.
Clark in New York. Both horse and
rider received the warmest reception
of the day when they returned to
weigh out.

H. Marsh, a new recruit among the
gentlemen riders, gave a clever exhi
bition of horsemanship on Rudolph
Spreckels' Hnnnma in the half mile
rare. He opened up a gap at the ptart
nrid was never headed. He seemed to
know his mount had the speed of the
field and sat perfectly still while the
other riders* were urging on their
nÂ«. unts desperately.
Frank Skinner landed Rudolph
Spreckels' Don an easy winner of the
quarter-mile race. The next three
horses, Leah, Alvernle and Princess
Flavia. finished necks apart.
IFhera was a scarcity of riders when
the first race was called and Cyril
Tobin obligingly accepted the mount
on Queen Rucker, the Southern Cali
fornia mare. She received a vigorous
ride and won by a neck from Hopeful,
ridden by Frank Skinner. The paris
mutuels paid $90 on each $5 ticket. Prin
cess Flavia was thought to have the
speed of this field, but she was away
badly and then got cut off In the
stretch.
Frank Skinner was the first to show
with Althomer after a straggling start
in the three-eighths of a mile race. He
held his advantage throughout, win

BENEFIT DRAWS
GREAT THRONG
Jim 31c Dona Id Is Shown the
Regard in Which He Is
Held by Sporting Public
There are but few men in this town
held in higher regard by the people
than Honest Jim McDonald. One look
at the stands and bleachers of Recrea
tion Park yesterday would convince
even the most skeptical on this score.
Fully 14,000 men and women who have
known the popular umpire fought and
struggled for a chance to gain admis
sion to the benefit game.
When Megaphone Joe Copeland an
nounced the contest and the batteries
and told the assembled hosts that the
proceeds would go to aid the noted in
dicator man, a thunder of applause
arose. It could be heard for blocks
around. The mention Of the name of
McDonald started every man, woman
and child in the grounds pheering and
they were all glad to have a. chance to
shout for the man they hold in esteem.
It was the first regular ball game
held in this city since the closing of the
league season and thp â  fans were
hungry for a bit of the national pas
time. The gate receipts of the exhi
bition were not officially announced
last night, but it is safe to aay that
between $4000 and $5000 was netted.
Donations came from all parts of the
Si.itc. Seattle sent $65 and Tacoma
$75. Thousands of people bought
tickets who did not attend the game.
The game was so great that the gates
of the park were closed before the
game started.
The afternoon's performance was
opened by Jimmy Britt and Sam Ber
ger in a three-round boxing bout. The
first two spasms looked like the every
day- stunt, but in the final round the
pair began to mix it and the fans
shouted with glee. Suddenly Berger
brought a right over on Britt's jaw
and the conqueror of Nelson and Cor
bett dropped like the proverbial log.
He was up quickly and a moment of
feinting elapsed and then Brltt got
ay.ay with the same stunt. There was
a short pause and both fell to the
ground together, apparently down and
out for keeps.
This made the spectators feel they
were real fight fans, so when Frankle
Neil and Joe Gans began to mix it
there was cheering and yelling galore.
This little mill proved equally as fast
as its predecessor, and, although no
knockdowns were scored, there was
lets of hitting, ducking; and clever
footwork, followed by applause from
the vast multitude.
The ball game was not the finest ex
hibition in the world, but it was base
ball all the same and good to look
upon. The teams were dubbed the
Fisher's and Geggus' nines and were
made up of National Leaguers, bush
leaguera and Pacific Coast Leaders.
The Geggus men were lucky and man
aged to hit the sphere on the nose at
times. Mike Fisher arid Charley Geg
gus held the indicators. Each made
some awful decisions, the worst in fact
the fans ever saw. Nobody but the
players got sore, and, as the latter had
no salaries coming, it was impossible
to impose fines on them.
Big Ovie Overall did not show up
and thus the crowd was in a measure
disappointed. Smiling Schmidty took
Overall's place and started to pitch
against Brother Joe Corbett. Schmidt's
offerings came up to the rubber like
balloons in the initial spasm and the
Fisher aggregation hammered in two
runs. The Geggus men managed to
amass two soon after. They swelled
thla number later on and before the
game was through they piled up seven,
while their opponents never scored
again.
All the favorites took part in the
game. Three pitchers were used by
each team. Schmidt was relieved by
Fitzpatrick, Corbett by Whalen. Soon
after that Goodwin, Morley's new
pitcher, was pitted - against Walter
Nagle. George Van Haltren, Charley
FORTY YEARS
FOR CARRINGTON
General Corbin Cables War
Office Confirming Eeports
of the Officers Conviction
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â Major
General Corbin, commanding the
Philippine division, cabled the War
Department to-day a confirmation of
the press report of the conviction of
Major Carrington at Manila and stat
ing that the sentence was forty years.
General Corbin says:
"Major Carrington convicted by thÂ«Â»
court of first instance of all counts
against him, sentenced to forty years
in the Bilibid prison. Appealed to
Supreme Court."
As the convicted officer is now in
his fiftieth year this action of the
court practically amounts to the im
position of a life sentence. The re
sult was obtained by the application
of the Spanish law permitting cumu
lative sentences, which is not common
in our civil or military laws. Major
Carringtons conviction raises some
exceedingly interesting legal ques
tions. One of these, on which it is
possible his case may be carried to
the Supreme Court of the United
States, is the constitutional question
of the right of a civil court in the
Philippines to separate a United
States military officer from his gov
ernmental service on account of an
overt act alleged to have been com
mitted by him in the discharge of his
duty to his own Government. The
question of the court's right to try an
American citizen is also involved.
Meanwhile the army itself does not
know what to do in Carrington's case,
as it is a problem how he can be
separated from the military service,
not having been convicted by court
martial, as the law requires as a con
dition precedent, or being 1 a deserter.
It has been suggested that this may
be done by nominating and confirming
his successor as a major in the United
States army, but present indications
are that no action will be taken by
the military authorities in that direc
tion pending the disposition of Car
rington's appeal to the higher courts.
Irwln, Danny Shay, Sam Mertes, and,
In fact, every popular star in the
league who was available scampered
oil the green. They were all given
the joyous mitt of welcome from the
fans. The score:

After Some Severe Races
Form players at Ingleside Coursing
Park yesterday met with poor luck
and they left the field with diminished
pocketbooks. The Oregon jacks gave
the slow dogs, which are stayers, a
thance to do some good work by tak
ing the longtails up and down the
field several times. Many of the dogs
which figured to run up In the stake
were forced to retire after hard trials.
Commercial Traveler proved his
merit on the clever jacks by winning
the class stake from Bob R in the
deciding course. The latter was sell
ing a 1 to 2 favorite. He had much
the better of the early part of the
race, but tired: then the Traveler
came on and won out.

THE END OF THE SESSION.
THE end of the session of the Legislature is approaching, and if
any important general legislation is to be had it must soon be
attended to. The State has expected a comprehensive measure
for reform in our system of taxation, in line with the recommen
dations of Governor Pardee, for it is a large subject and as im-
portant as it is large. ' .
We do not always have a Governor as skilled in economics and
a* wise in relation to taxation as Governor Fardee. His recom
mendations were carefully studied out and are supported by the best
scientific authority. They cannot be made effective Vy piecemeal
bills. They must 'be embodied as a whole in a comprehensive meas
ure. When this is done there will be a balancing of burdens and
benefits that will quiet opposition. To illustrate ; the proposition to
put a special State license tax on the liquor trade, standing alone, is
at once knocked out by opposition of the liquor interests, but as
part of a general measure a proposition to make liquor dealing sub
ject to State license only, for State purposes, exonerating it from
local license entirely, would not be opposed.
The same is true of all the objects of exclusive State taxation
suggested by Governor Pardee. They should be exonerated from
local taxation entirely, and other forms of property for the support
of local government "should be exonerated from State taxation en
tirely. A mixed system would be intolerable and would only in
crease the evils that should be abolished. /
The State has been led to expect some action in this matter by
the present Legislature. The member of either house who, having
the required knowledge, will take it up, make it a specialty and pass
ifl will win honor and enduring fame. Granted that it is not a
showy subject, fit for gaudy display, yet it is a matter that goes
straight to the interests of every citizen and to every dollar's worth
of property in the State. It touches the pocket nerve, which is the
most sensitive of all. v
Another matter of prime importance that is lagging unexpectedly
is the rectification of the rivers to prevent destructive overflow of
floods. The measure seems to have made but little headway and is
meeting with much opposition in the Sacramento Valley counties.
The Colusa Sun says that is due to the failure of the Promotion
Committee and the special committee" in charge to consult the land
until and the people who are to be immediately affected by it.
Whatever the cause, if it be corrigible, it should be corrected. The
plan of the engineers, though costly, is feasible, and it leaves no
doubt that when- carried out the flood terror will cease.
Of course it costs money. Great benefits and small must be
paid for. Tt is rarely that anything of importance can be had for
nothing. The restraint of floods must be paid for. The cost of re
straint is paid only once. The destruction and loss by floods must
be sustained many times, as often as the floods come. The loss is
cumulative. If it be ascertained and calculated at simple interest
it will be seen that in a fe*' years it amounts to the whole sum re
ouired to complete the plans of the engineers. The scheme of recla
mation and its cost oug^t to be explicable to the land owners and
people, so as to secure support, instead of the portentous opposition
which now seem* to exist.
It should not be forgotten that on the score of the Sacramento
River being a meandered stream, navigable, and therefore a Federal
river, we propose asking the United States to share the cost of cor
rection with the State. We expect our willing members of Con
gress to make the effort for us at Washington. If the State do
nothing, they can do nothing. If the Legislature can do no more
this session than to pledge the State, tentatively, to a fixed contribu
tion, conditioned on Congress causing the Federal Government to
join in an appropriation, it should do this. If the Federal Govern
ment refuse our tentative appropriation is nullified and at the next
session we can try something else. We are clear, however, that our
members of Congress should have the support of the State in such
a tentative offer. Otherwise we send them to make bricks without
straw.
The Legislature should not adjourn without resubmitting to the
people the constitutional amendment exempting American shipping
from local taxation, thus putting it on an equality with the foreign
shipping with which it must compete. This amendment was de
feated at the last election by a misunderstanding caused by vicious
misrepresentation of its scope and purpose. The people are entitled
to an opportunity to correct their mistake, and only the Legislature
can give it to them.
The matters above suggested are of large importance and great
public concern. They are general legislation of the most necessary
nature. Of course members are interested in measures affecting
their districts. .counties and sections. It is proper that they be
watchful of these. This is their duty to their immediate constit-
uency. They would be blameworthy if they failed in its discharge.
But they must not so focus attention, each upon the- local demands of
his immediate constituency, as to neglect the large, general and im
portant interests of the whole State, which affect all of the people
alike, in every district, county and section.
The time is short, but it is long enough to get the right of way
for some, if not all, of this general legislation.
OUTSIDE DAIRIES.
HEALTH OFFICER RAGAN'S report upon the sanitary con
dition of dairies in the counties surrounding San Francisco
brings to light a serious condition of affairs and shows that
however watchful our authorities may be in their zeal for cleanliness
in dairies under their own jurisdiction, their efforts will be nullified
unless rigid steps be taken to guard against diseased and unclean
milk from other counties.
During the past month San Francisco dairy inspectors have ex
amined ninety-nine dairies in Alameda, Santa Clara, Contra Costa,
San Mateo and Marin counties and rate thirty-nine as good, twenty
two as fair and thirty-eight as poor. A showing of but a little over
one-third in good sanitary condition is far from creditable and makes
exceeding vigilance by our health authorities necessary to avoid be
ing flooded with unclean milk. This city has had great difficulty in
placing her own dairies under proper regulation and it is unfortunate
that her troubles on that subject do not end there. It is true that
unhealthy milk from the outside may be destroyed when found, but
coming as it usually does under cover of night, by boats, railroads
and wagons, it requires great efforts to keep the traffic within proper
bounds.
The mere fact of posting the rating of a dairy in the Health
Office does not tend greatly to the question, as consumers
will not exert themselves to the degree of going there to make in
quiries. Conferences with authorities of the other counties looking
toward remedial measures should be instituted, and if that fail jf
success some greater means of publishing the derelicts and of
keeping them published should be taken until the remedy is obtained.
Publicity is a great purifier and is one of the best means known to
bring those into line who ca#Miot be reached by the question of ju
risdiction.
The danger lurking in impure milk is possibly greater than in
any other food item because of the diversity of uses to which it is
put, and because it strikes with particular force at children, who are
leÂ«s able to resist disease than are adults. Every effort of our
Health Board in seeking out these sources of danger should be com
mended and every assistance be given to them in the matter.
Expensive a* a modern navy may be, it returns* to its owners in security
and the assurance of freedom from aggression a profit impossible to calculate.
n no section of the country is the billion dollars that has been spent upon
ships and personnel sludged or regTetted. The strongest argument that the
administration has to urge In favor of a continuing liberal treatment of the
aavy Is the establishment as it exists to-day.â New York Sun,

love the sun. And you must tend it
every day, skillfully, pulling the weeds
up, loosening the earth about the roots
that they may get the air they need,
and watering itâ when the time comes
âwith tears that fall so softly they
could not hurt or mar the tenderness
of growing things.
This is what it means truly to love
And because I believe so, I want to
say a word to-day to the girl who
thinks her heart is broken.
Love was not given to us to break
our hearts. It had a better mission.
It came to say to you and me: "Look!
listen!" It came to show us the world
that we live in, to enable us to under
stand life's vfsible manifestations, and
to help us to look into the human
hearts about us. y
This is such a joyous world, if you
only look and listen. It is so full of
promises that are certain of fulfill
ment. There is "not a single sunset
that does not mean a coming morning.
In fall, when flowers seem to die,' it is
their seedtime.

KIT, KITTY AND THE KITTEN
L C I k*^ your pardon, but can you
â¢ I tell me how to wash a cat?"
I Christopher Caswell held up a
' black kitten with a very dirty
white shirt front to justify the
question.
Catherine Turner caught it in her
arms. "Isn't it a dear!" she cried.
"Where did you get it? "
"I didn't get it," said Christopher
(known to his friends as "Kit"); "it
got me. You see, last night was pretty
snowy, and this little beast followed
me all the way down the street."
"And you took it in? How pood of
you!" '
"I didn't exactly take her in; she
led the way. After that I couldn't
chuck her out in the snow again."
Kitty Turner gave him a look that
seemed to him to bore into the inner
most recesses of his heart. He had
worshiped her from afar ever since
she had come into the studio building.
This was the first opportunity he had
had to speak with her.
"You get some soap and tepid
water," explained Kitty. "Then you
souse her well, dry her off and wrap
heÂ»- in a blanket and hold her until*
she dries out. You have an extra
blanket?"
"Oh, yes," said Kit, mendaciously,
vowing that his steamer rug was none
too good for a cat that had lain in
Miss Turner's arms.
Kitty handed the waif to Kit, "Have
you fed her?"
"Pure," was the prompt response.
"She had a pint of cream this morn
ing, though I'm sure she doesn't look
it yet."
"You must not overfeed her," de
creed Kitty. "I'll bring you some
fish for her supper. All cats like fish."
Then the door shut and Kit went back
to his own apartments, assuring the
unenthusiastic kitten that -she was
about to have the bath of her brief ex
istence.
The preliminaries were simple
enough, though Kit's ideas of tepid
| water were rather above, the standard
temperature. Grasping the cake of
soap in one hand and the kitten in
the other. Kit soaped her and boldly
plunged the unsuspecting guest into
the water. As she touched the water
she gave vent to a howl that fright
ened Kit and made a spring for the
edge of the tub.
Kit dropped the soap and grabbed
at the cat, but his hands and the cat
were slippery with soap, and he
hugged her to his breast to secure
her. This turned the frightened little
animal on her back, and in an instant
Kit's face was streaked with crimson.
With a howl he dropped the kitten
back into the tub, from which she
made her escape unhampered and
promptly vanished under the sofa in
the sitting-room.
Kit bathed his face, smeared it with
salve and then started after the kit
ten again. With the aid of the crook
handled cane he dragged her from her
hiding place, the dust matted in her
wet fur. Clearly that bath was more
than ever a necessity. Kit tempered
JIU-JITSU AS IMPORTED FROM JAPAN
Jiu-Jitsu has its most distinguished
American exponent in the President.
And he has expressed his opinion that
the art is worth more, in every way,
than all of our athletic sports com
bined. He has emphasized his opinion
by securing Yamashita as instructor in
the art for the Naval Academy. After
a while, the same work is to be taught
at the Military Academy. The heads
of several municipal police depart
ments stand ready to introduce the
work among the policemen under them.
The present difficulty is the scarcity
of aualined instructors in this coun
try.
If Americans are to reap the utmost
benefit from the introduction of jiu
jitsu here, the start 'must be made in
the right way. In Japan, there are
many methods of jiu-jitsu. There is
only one, however, that is recognised
as official. That is the eclectic system
devised in recent years by Professor
Jiguro Kano, principal of the High
Normal School of Tokio. Jiu-JltÂ»u in

the water from the faucet and finally
accomplished the task.
When Kitty knocked at the door an
hour later she very nearly fainted at
the apparition -which confronted her.
Kit, with his shirt front wet and torn,
his face streaked with blood and
grease, bearing under his arm a
wadded mass of steamer rug. certainly
presented a formidable appearance.
"I gave her a bath," he grinned
cheerfully.
"J should say you did." agreed
Kitty. "Did you have a fight?"
'Did I?" echoed Kit. "Do you
know, I'm going to form a new soci
ety for the Prevention of Cruelty from
Animals?"
"Is that the cat?" she demanded.
"What's left of it," he answered,
picking at the bundle. The cat
dropped out and streaked into Kitty's
apartment. She ran after it, and when
she came out again she carried cloths
and a bottle, as well as the kitten.
The kitten she quickly settled in a
chair before the radiator. Then she
turned her attention to Kit. Tenderly
she washed off the ointment and
bathed the scratches, applying a sooth
ing lotion.
"That will take the sting out," she
said, as she turned to go. "If you will
leave the door unlocked I'll come in
later and change the cloths again."
To Kit it seemed as if the familiar
sitting-room had suddenly grown
gloomy and depressing, and he lay
there wondering at the difference a
woman's presence makes.
Kit Caswell had been a confirmed
Japan is the art of the gentleman; it
is not Intrusted to the class of subjects
who would correspond to our prize
fighters. Hence, it is appropriate that
the recognized authority on jiu-jitsu is
also one of the leading educators of
his country.
It is the Kano system that the Presi
dent has mastered: it is this system
which is to be taught at Annapolis
and at West Point. The Kano is the
official system of Japan, which is
taught to every officer and enlisted
man of the Japanese army, navy, and
police departments. All of the other
schools of jiu-jitsu, while providing
methods that seem clever to the un
initiated American, are helplessly in
ferior before the Kano methods. Some
of these inferior systems contain as
many as three hundred feats each; the
Kano has but one hundred and sixty
feats, yet the Kano provides a wholly
adequate defense*, not only against the
Anglo-Saxon boxer or wrestler, but
against the adept of any one of the
the power tc heal where it wounds
you.
The only thing that I really dread
in this life is numbness â not to feel,
not. to care, not to be able to suffer.
That would make me a ghost among
those who live. But If you have love
in your heart, whether it hurts you or
makes you happy, you have everything
your womanls spirit needs, and you
are a living force in the world of the
living.
Perhaps the man whom you loved
made you think that he cared for you
when he did not. May be you never
hoped for his love a minute. Possibly
you have quarreled with him and the
time has passed when you can make
up the matter. Well, it's over, and
whatever was sweet in it is yours to
remember and whatever was bitter you
will forget, if you really loved.
Meanwhile there is your heart to
attend to; it is cold, cheerless and the
world needs warmth from it. And
hf ; re is your sweet woman's garden,
thick with underbrush and prickly
with thistles. Alas! the dainty moths
of fancy are languid on the dying
flowers.
Yet you say that you love? That It
is love which makes you suffer? My
dear, the love that you gave to this
man who hurt you cannot compare
with the love that one day you will
give to him whom you marry. This
love, if you cherish it wisely, will enter
into that love, so that in your new
happiness you will never miss it. But
it will be there, just the same, part
of you, making the new love sweeter
and making you a nobler woman.
bachelor ever since he had come from
college. He railed at marriage and
love until his victims swore that some
day they. would have their revenge by
seeing him struggling against the ad
vances of the little god of love.
Now he confessed to himself that
their dark prophecies had come true,
only they were not dark prophecies.
He found, to his surprise, that being
ir love was an altogether agreeable
sensation.
His face soon mended under Kitty's
care, but his heart was less easily
cured. Kitty was friendly, but bliss
fully unconscious of his lovemaking.
There were little friendly visits to
the door with some dainty, approved
by the feline species; brief chats in
the elevator and the lobby about cat
r.ature and education; but somehow
Kitty's absorption in the kitten fended
off the tender speeches that hung
trembling on Christopher's tongue.
Several times he determined to put
liis? fate to the test, but some incident
restrained him until she had gone. It
was a fit that finally brought his cour
age to the proper point.
The kitten, as all kittens will, in
dulged in the luxury of a fit, and Kit,
in hot haste, summoned Kitty to the
rescue. Her tenderness with the suf
fering beast fanned his love into a
fierce heat, and when she had gone
back to her own rooms he sat and
applied picturesque appellations to
himself for a coward. Then he
crossed the hall and knocked on Kit
ty's door.
"I want to talk to you about the
cat." he began lamely.
"Is she worse?" asked Kitty, anx
iously.
"It isn't that," he explained. "It's
about her future. May I come in?"
She stood aside hospitably, and he
entered the little den, strewn with its
half-completed bits of china paint
ing.
"I don't think I can keep that cat."
he began, when she had settled her
self.
"They are an awful comfort," she
urged.
"And an awful responsibility," he
added. "I don't think a bachelor
should try to keep a cat."
"I used to keep one." she said, care
lessly and found it very easy. If
you will follow my directions about
feeding it you will have very little
trouble. '
"Tfiey say black cats are very
lucky," he observed.
"Indeed they are. I know lots of
instances where they have brought
good luck."
"I thought," he said nervously,
"that you might like to have it."
"I couldn't think of taking her
away from you," she cried. "She is
such a comfort to you."
"Well, you see," he continued, his
heart thumping violently, "I go with
the cat; one of those trading stamp
games, you know."
It was unconventional, but Kitty has
the kitten â and Kit. (Copyright,

HONORS MEMORY
OF ITS DEAD
Ignatian Council, Y. M. 1.,
Assist at Solemn Requi
em High Mass for Departed
MANY MEMBERS ATTEND
Archbishop Montgomery De
livers Sermon and Pays an
Eloquent Tribute to Order
The members of Ignatian Council No. j
35, Young Men's Institute, honored the
memory of their dead yesterday by as~
sisting at a solemn requiem high mass,
which was celebrated in St. Ignatius
Church at 10 a. m. Two hundred mem
bers of the council attended in a body
and joined in the impressive services, j
which were in honor of the departed
members of the entire order. Imme
diately in front of the altar was the
catafalque, at the head of which stood
an obelisk with appropriate inscrip
tions on its four sides.
The celebrant of the mass was the
Rev. P. G. Butler, S. J.. assisted by
Rev. J. E. Cottle of St. Brigid's Church
as deacon, and Rev. Father J. J. Cul
len of Mayfield as subdeacon. J.
Leherty. S. J.. was master of ceremo
nies and there was a full complement
of acolytts. A number of visiting
clergymen had seats inside the altar
vail. An augmented male choir in
toned the music of the mass under the
leadership of Maurice O'Connell.
The sermon was preached by Arch
bishop Montgomery, whose subject was
drawn from the beautiful lesson shown
in the commemoration of the dead by
Ignatian Council. Archbishop Mont
gomery paid an eloquent tribute to the
aims and purposes of the Young Men's
Institute, which he said was doing
more to uplift society than many other
organizations. Continuing, Archbishop
Montgomery said:
One of the most beautiful ceremonies of the
church Is the celebration of the holy sacrifice
of the mass, which permits us to unite our
prayen for thr repose of those who have (fone
before. The mass brings the church Into closer
personal relationship with her children, thus
withdrawing us from the frlvolitiea of the
world and eausinr a serious meditation on
death. The scripture tells us it is a holy and
wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that
they may be lo< s- <1 from their sins. It it
proper to pray for the living as well as thÂ»
dead.
The sin of the age is forfetfulness of God.
Men are tco prone to deny, neglect and Ignore
God, who alone can give a stable foundation to
society Prayr-r puts the soul in certain pos
session of God. and the public act of faith is
almost inestimable in value. The mission of
the church is not to convert, but to preach the
gospel of Christ. It would admonish you to
be practical Catholics. Be true to your motto,
"For God and Country." and have an ambi
tion to live for somethine higher and holier
than the mere dross of worldly pursuits.
Prayers were particularly requested
for the repose of the souls of fifty
eight deceased members of Ignatian
Council, their names being printed on
cards passed among the congregation.
The committee of arrangements con
sisted of Rev. P. G. Butler. S. J.; I. D.
Dwyer. R. D. Blake and B. H. Foley.
The ushers were J. W. McCarthy, J.
F. Barry, W. J. Hamilton, F. A. Mc-
Carthy and C. L. Ebner.

IRA BISHOP
ENDS LIFE
IN THE PARK
WELL-KNOWN BUBINESS MAN
WHO ENDED HIS TROUBLES
WITH A PISTOL BULLET.
Paralytic Stroke
Drives Him
to Deed,
Worn out with sickness, and with all
dope gone of a restoration to health,
[ra Bishop, proprietor of the Hotel
Kyle at 230 Powell street, went to
Golden Gate Park last Tuesday and
3hot himself through the brain. Mr.
Bishop was a prominent man in the
business community. He was at one
time proprietor of the Piedmont Baths
in Oakland, and was manager of the
Oakland street railway system at the ;
time of its sale to the Oakland Transit
Company. He leaves a wife and two
sons, nineteen and twenty-seven years |
of age. One son, Angus Bishop, is (
clerk at the St. Francis Hotel. Last j
June Mr. Bishop was seized with a j
stroke of paralysis, and despite the t
best of medical aid and care, he grew J
worse, so that he could walk only with <
great difficulty. He often threatened
that he would take his own life rather |
than live to" be a burden to his friends
and himself.
The body was seen in. a clump of
bushes 100 yards west of the lodge in
Golden Gate Park last Tuesday after
noon by Catherine Ronning of 417 Ash
bury street, and Catherine Thome of
1550 Page street. They thought It was
the body of a drunken man asleep and
did not approach to make a closet
examination. Miss Thorne visited the
place again yesterday morning and
saw the same body lying there. Ap
proaching more closely she saw that
the man's face was bloody and she
gave the alarm. Some money and
checks were found on the body. A
cheap pistol was found near the right
hand of the corpse.
OAKLAND. Feb. 22.â Ira Bishop was
at one time the general manager of
the San Francisco Tool Company, and
it was through this work that he be
came interested in Oakland. When
the Piedmont Cable Road was con
structed he was given the contract in
consideration of his floating the bonds.
This he did with Hawaiian Island
capitalists, chief among whom was C.
R. Bishop, a relative of his. The Pied
mont Cable Road went into the hands
of a receiver, and Mr. Bishop was
placed in charge to manage the con
cern for the bondholders. During this
period Mr. Bishop resided in Oakland.
F. M. Smith then secured the Pied
mont system, and when he began his
consolidation of the Oakland strret
railroads owned by him Mr. Bishop
became the general manager of the en
tire system for a while. He was suc
ceeded by W. F. Kelly, the present
general manager, and after that re
moved to San Francisco.

DENVERITES ARE
IN BIG SCHEME
Colorado Capitalists Are
Here Completing Plans
for Electric Power Plant
WILL BENEFIT TONOPAH
Projectors of Bishop Creek
Enterprise Getting Ready
to Carry Out Their Work
A party of Denver capitalists, who j
are interested with Millionaire Law- I
rence Phipps in the Bishop Creek pro- j
ject to supply Tonopah and Goldfields ,
with electric power, have been at the ;
St. Francis since Monday complet- |
ing arrangements for the carrying out
of the big enterprise. Among the party |
are Rodney Curtis, head of the street
railway service of Denver; Samuel
Woods, who has been associated with
David Moffit in several big undertak
ings, and F. J. Campbell, also promi- '.
nently identified with the industries of
Colorado. T. B. Rickey, a well
known capitalist and mining man of
Carson City, who is interested in the
new power syndicate, is also here and ,
staying at the Palace.
The proposed plans of the company
include the establishment of a gener
ating plant at Eishop Creek, in Call-;
fornia, just over the boundary line
from Nevada. From the natural flow
of this creek the company expects to
develop 4000 horsepower and will in- â¢
crease this capacity to 20,000 horse- ;
power by the construction of three
small dams along the stream at a
cost of $100,000. It will transmit the
power about seventy-flve miles to
Tonopah. The power will be used
mainly for hoisting and drilling pur-
I poses and will result in a great saving
of water, now used for steam, leaving
the water available for milling pur
poses. It will make it possible to mill
i cheaply low grade ores, which the
! present cost of transportation makes
I it impossible to ship to market.
Under the company's plans a stor
age capacity for production of electric
power will be obtained at a cost of
$5 per horsepower. This is regarded
as remarkably low. The promoters of
the scheme have already made the
necessary surveys and are now pur
chasing poles and other material for
their transmission plant.

RICH VICTIM
Arrival of Special Police
man Saves Small Fortune
for the Ohio's Chief Cook
ESCAPES WITH BEATING
Bold Crooks 3lake Desperate
Efforts to Secure His
Jewelry Valued at $1400
W. E. Odgers, chief cook on the
battleship Ohio, narrowly escaped los
ing the results of fifteen years' saving*
last night at 11 o'clock to three daring
footpads. As a result of their attack
he is being doctored at the Harbor
Hospital for lacerations of the head
and hands. Odgers wore on his finger*
several rings containing diamond* val
ued at $1175 and also carried a gold
"watch and fob worth $250. The dia
monds represented his savings and
were a convenient way for carrying hiÂ»
wealth.
Odgero made the acquaintance of a
man in the Montana dance hall on
Kearny street near- Pacific and waa
persuaded to accompany him down
Sansome street on the way to a ho
tel. At Halleck, two men Joined the
decoy and the three attacked the sailor.
They attempted to steal his rings and
watch but failed and were frightened
away by the arrival of a special po
liceman, but not before severely beat
ing their victim with slungshots.
H. C. Aachen, a saloon keeper of
1032 Market street, was held up at
Page and Pierce streets at 7 o'clock
last night by a footpad, The robber
took thirty cents and a gold watch and
chain and then beat his victim over
the head with a revolver and fired a
shot after him as he disappeared. The
police are investigating both cases.
FRATERNITIES GIVE PARTIES.
Entertainments by Many Societies
Followed by Modern Dances.
Lyric Hall was crowded last night
with members of King Solomon Chap
ter, Order of the Eastern Star, and
members of other chapters and others
who do not belong to the order. The
occasion was the '"colonial party" giv
en by the chapter named. There were
many in the costumes of the days of
AVashington who stood out in attract
ive contrast from those attired in mod
ern ballroom attire. Excellent mu
sic carried the dancers along in rhyth
mical motion, particularly in the court
minuet. The affair was one of the
most Dieasant social functions this
chapter has ever given.
Court Southern Heights of the In
dependent Order of Foresters gave a
complimentary party in Golden Gate
Hall, which was crowded to its limits
by those who accepted the invitations.
A pleasing programme of music, songs,
recitations and literary numbers held
the audience for an hour and a half,
after which there was dancing until
midnight. The hall was artistically
decorated.
One of the delightful functions of last
evening was the "juvenile night" un
der the auspices of Court Apollo of the
Ancient Order of Foresters in Mission
Turn Verein Halle on Eighteenth
street. The programme of numbers
was entirely by minors, a number of
them professionals, and their efforts
to please were warmly applauded. At
the entrance to the hall each one was
presented with a souvenir of the occa
sion. After the entertainment the
committee of the court took charge,
and under its superintendence there
was dancing for old and young.
The complimentary ball given last
evening by the San Franciscp Frauen
Verein in Saratoga Hall was attended
by a large number of the German
speaking people of the community, also
by many not familiar with that lan
guage. A pleasing feature was the
presentation of a tableau by members
of the verein representing George
Washington, Martha Washington and
ladies of the smart set of colonial
days. The assumed characters were
correctly dressed and made a pretty
living picture. There was a well-ar
ranged order of dances, with good mu
sic.
Carnation Lodge of the Degree of
Honor, A. O. U. W., had an enjoyable
midwinter picnic by artificial light
in the Laurel Hall of the Shiels build
ing, which for the time being was con
verted into a grove. Under the trees
there were games, races, dancing and
lunching. The many who were on the
"picnic grounds" enjoyed themselves
as they would have done at a country
outing. In addition to the regular rou
time of picnic entertainment there
were vocal solos and recitations.
The costumes that were worn by
nearly three hundred persons who at
tended the fancy dress ball in the ban
quet hall of the Odd Fellows' build
ing were striking, some rich, others
attractive, many grotesque and others
unique. There was a spirit of mirth
that made it agreeable to be on the
floor and take part in the long order
of dances.
The social given by Altahmos Tribe
of the Improved Order of Red Men in
the Assembly Hall of the Red Men's
building was a charming function and
was enjoyed by a large number. The
affair was well managed and the order
of dances was of modern numbers, in
which the two-step predominated.
The Friends of the Forest had a
pleasant social in Mission Opera Hall.
a sort of family reunion, at which
dancing was the feature. The friends
had a jolly time.
Meade Post's Exorcises.
George G. Meade Post, Grand Army
of the Republic, entertained its mem
bers and friends last evening at an in
formal smoker at 102 O'Farrell street.
An appropriate programme, distinctly
Washingtonian in character, was ren
dered and patriotic speeches and na
tional songs were spoken and sung.
The members of the post report the
organization in excellent condition as
regards its general management and
financial standing.

Embauador Porter Addresses Ameri
can Colony at Banquet in Paris.
PARIS. Feb. 22. â The feature of
the Washington's birthday banquet of
the American Club was a speech by
Embassador Porter detailing the
search he has prosecuted the last five
years for the grave of the founder of
the American navy. John Paul Jones.
The Embassador said:
Before coming to France I felt a â¢ens* of
humiliation to think that the most famous
naval hero of the revolution and founder of the
American navy has been permitted to lie for
more than a century in an unknown and for
gotten foreifrn trrave without an effort to rescue
the remains from oblivion. *
While other nations are {fathering the ashes
of their heroes In their pantheons all that la
mortal of this marvelous organizer of Amer
ican victories upon the sea Hps like an outcast
in a squalid quarter of a distant city in a
neglected grave, where It was placed by the
hands of charity to keep it from the potter's
field. What was once consecrated ground is
desecrated by vegetable gardens and even the
burial of doge. It Is flttlnsr that an effort N*
made to give him a sepulcher at least In the
land of liberty which his efforts helped make
free.

Off Shore for Many Days.
ThÂ«? harkentlne Irmsard, the last to arrive
of the trio of sugar packets which engaged In
a race <rcm Honolulu, reached port yesterday
mcrninir. 2$ days from the island port and
just ;hrÂ»-' days too late to make a triple tie
of the race. The Archer and . Santiago each
made the run in twenty. five days. The Irm
pard had hard luck. During the early part
of the voyage fortune fairly grinned at the
barkeruine, and the twelfth day out from Hon
olulu found her within 300 miles of this port.
Then came a heavy northeaster, and the longer
f-he sailed the farther away she went from
her home port. Phe was sixteen days coining
from a point SOO miles away, and Captain
Schmidt was very tired of contrary winds long
before yesterday morning, hen hÂ« anchored
off E!ack Point. The Irmgard came in during
a thick fog and narrowly aped etriking the
Black Point rocks. The barkentine's bowsprit
was wi;hln an easy Jums of -the steep-sided
bluff when the tug Dauntless yanked her away
frcm danger and towed her to a safe anchor
aire. The Irmsard brought 18,535 bags of
Evear. -~
Protet Fires National Salute.
Of all the vessels that - were decorated yes
terday in nooor of George Washington's birth
day none wore gayer dress than the French
cruiser Protet. There vu no room for any
more buntins' than fluttered over the smart
wairhip, and when noon came and the batteries
on Yerba Buena, the battleship Ohio and the
naval reserve ship Marion, fired a national sa
lute, the Protet joined In the chorus and
burned twenty-one generous charges of French
powder to the glory of an American tradition.
The Peaeacola, at Yerba BuÂ«na ; the Ohio. off
, vhÂ» Union Ircn Works, and the Marlon, at
HarriEon-etreet wharf, all dressed ehlp in honor
cf the day. !Â»ng lines of Sags streamed from
the arm;, transport.* Warren and Logan. Most
of the British ships at anchor in the stream
alongside the wharves were frayly dressed. The
Oceanlo Eteamchip Company's liner Ventura
displayed as much burning as the Protet Th*
<â *Â«>â¢ of Puebla and the State of California
â were also decorated. The Humboldt was
ereered in bunting, and the British tramp
Fteamer Brickburn. the almost blockade run
ner, contributed to the brilliant color scheme.
Forgot to Stop the Bell.
A thick foe errvelopÂ«d the harbor yesterday
morning and all thÂ« stationary fog signals
rang or whistled their warnings with auto
matic regularity. When the fog cleared away
and a bright son blazed in a clear sky
the signals were silenced â all but one of them.
Somebody forgot to stop the clock that runs
thÂ« fog bell on Lombard -street wharf, and all
through the day of clear, bright California sun
chine the bronze clapper clanged on the metal
Â«ides, to the brwlMerment of the seagulls and
the astonishment of the Greek fishermen. One
of the latter explained to his fellow-toilers
the reason for the unseasonable tolling of the
bell. "Georga the Wash." he said, "was
Ki-rata the beega man. He maka die, poor*
id. ' Tfcf y tinea the bell for hees funeral."

WOMAN PERISHES
IN THE FLAMES
Mrs. Virginia L. Bunter Ac-
cidentally Upsets a Lamp
and Is Burned to Death
BUILDING IS DESTROYED
Husband Admits That His
Wife Had Been Drinking,
Which Explains Tragedy
Mrs. Virginia Louisa Bunter, col
ored, wife of George Bunter, a porter
employed by the Olympic Club, per
ished last night in flames that de
stroyed her home at 4 Lewis street.
The woman accidentally overturned a
kerosene lamp and started a blaze that
not only resulted in her own death but
imperiled thousands of dollars' worth
of property in the neighborhood of
Post and Taylor streets. The Bunter
home, a two-story structure, was com
pletely destroyed and before the de
partment succeded in quenching the
flames one of the large frame lodging
ttiouses adjoining had been badly
scorched.
The alarm of flre was turned in by
J. L. Gonzalbes, whose apartments on
Taylor street overlook the Bunter resi
dence. Gonzalbes and his wife were
attracted by cries for help and, look
ing from a window, saw Mrs. Bunter in
the act of throwing some burning ob
ject from a second story window in her
home. Gonzalbes summoned assist
ance and caused an alarm to be given.
When help reached the house on Lewis
street it was <ound that the interior
of the structure was ablaze and the
smoke was too dense to permit any one
to enter.
The flre waÃ burning fiercely when
the department arrived and it was first
supposed that both Bunter and his
wife had perished, as both had been
at home early in the evening, When
the flames were under control the char
red body of the woman was discovered
in a room on the first floor. A search
was continued among the ruins for the
body of the husband, but an hour after
the alarm had been turned in Bunter
appeared on the scene.
Bunter explained that he had left his
home with George Mitchell, a roomer
in the house, about 7 o'clock, or two
hours before the fire. He reluctantly
admitted that his wife had been drink
ing and this fact is probably responsi
ble for the accident. The woman's
body was removed to the Morgue. In
company with her husband she was to
have left for Spokane in two weeks.
She was 35 years of age and had been
married ten years.
R. B. FRIEND
DIES AFTER A
BRIEF ILLNESS
OAKLAND, Feb. 22.â Roger B.
Friend, general manager of the Pacific
: Coast agency of the Providence Insur
ance Company, died unexpectedly at
, Â» o'clock to-night at his residence, 1009
Madison street.
He had been ill only two weeks. A
sudden turn for the worse was followed
quickly this evening by complete col
lapse and death. The trouble was a
form of nervous prostration, causing
intense neuralgic conditions. Dr. Clar
ence Selfridge had been in attendance.
Mr. Friend was one of the most promi
. nent fire insurance men in California.
Though young he had reached an im
portant place in that field.
He began in his youth with hi 9
father, William H. Friend, then secre
tary of the Sun Insurance Company.
. Later he was with Voss, Conrad
& Co. in San Francisco and became
their general adjuster, his duties tak
ing him over the Pacific Coast. After
that firm retired from business Mr.
Friend took the position he held at the
time of his death. His ability and
: charm of personality won him high
recognition and hosts of friends. His
death is a severe blow to Miss Jane
i Crellin, daughter of Thomas Crellin.
i president of the Central Bank. Oak
i land, who was his fiancee. The en
' gagement, which was made public the
j day before New Year's, was one of the
' important social announcements of the
! season. Mr. Friend was about 30
years old, a native of California. He
was prominent in the Masonic fra
ternity. His father was formerly
I postmaster of Oakland and is now
connected with the administrative staff
of the State Hospital at Napa. The
Rev. William Nat Friend, pastor of
the First Presbyterian Church of Gol
den, Colo., is a brother. His mother
! also survives. The funeral arrange
j ments have not been made.
CLAIMED THREE STATES.
â¢Terry McCralth, a Pioneer, Passes
Away In Northwest.
WALLA WALLA, Wash., Feb. 22.â
Jerry McCralth, one of the most unique
figures in the early history of the
Northwest, died yesterday at the
County Poor Farm. McCraith came
here in 1862 Â»from San Francisco and
was best known as the proprietor of a
resort known as "McCraith's Castle. "_
McCralth gained considerable notoriety"
some years ago by filing a claim in
San Francisco to the largest part of
what is now Oregon, Washington and
Idaho, under an old Spanish'grant. He
fought the case until his means were
exhausted and he was obliged to work
his passage back to Walla Walla.
Accuse Two Mefl of Burglary.
LiUcian Diskill and Joseph Lenehan
were arrested last night by Sergeant
H. H. Christiansen and booked at the
Southern station on a burglary
charge. They are accused of enter
ing the room of L. E. Huntsman, at
783% Market street, and stealing four
razors and a hairbrush.

IROQUOIS HOLD
ANNUAL DINNER
Attendance of Braves Is
Small, but Resolutions
I and Speeches Are Plentiful
BIG FEAST AT NIGHT
8. s. Bailey Elected Grand
Sachem and Judge Raker
Gets the Second Place
The cloud of smoke brought but few
braves to the gathering of the Iro
quois in this city yesterday, but those
who did come represented nearly every
section of the State, and there was
much good talking and a Arm reso
lution to revive the efficiency of the
Democratic party. It was the twenty
first annual assemblage of the organi
zation, and after a business session
there was a potlatch at night at Del
monico's.
The following officers were elected to
serve during the ensuing year: Grand
sachem, S. S. Bailey of San Francisco;
first vice sachem. Judge John E.
Raker of Modoc; secretary. Larry J.
Welch; treasurer, Louis Metzger; as
sistant secretary, H. L. Bienenfleld.
Resolutions were adopted on political
issues. Among other things the State
Senate was urged to expel the four
members who had been found guilty
of "shameless Doodling." The follow
ing resolution, which was defeated be
cause of its harsh strictures on the
State's lawmakers, occasioned a spirit
ed debate, in which words of censure
were freely expressed for those Demo
crats who have no purpose but to rant
at all established order of things:
Whereat, The Stats Legislature has re
peatedly refused to submit constitutional
amendments inroivlns; the basic principles of
democratic government, among others thÂ« â¢lec
tion of United States Senators by direct vote.
Increased local powers for cities, the abolition
of the spoils system, a Just system of taxation
and the proper control of quasi public cor
pcrations; and
Whereas. Legislatures cannot be trusted to
voluntarily submit constitutional amendments
restricting their own power: therefore be It
Resolved, That we favor a constitutional
amendment which will give thÂ» people the
right to submit constitutional am^dments by
petition of a certain percentage of the voters.
E. R. Zion of San Francisco, J. C.
Ruddick of Mendocino and C. W.
Moores of San Francisco strongly
urged the adoption of the resolution.
William J. Locke, president ot the
Iroquois Club of San Francisco, spoke
the words of welcome to the banquet
board last night and introduced M. C.
Hassett as toastmaster. The following
were the speakers: H. G. Davis.
Arthur H. Barendt, Sidney Van Wyck.
Walker C. Graves and Judge John E.
Raker of Modoc.
"MIGNON" IS
FINELY GIVEN
BY BERLINDI
Berlindi has had no greater night at
the Tivoli. since her introduction, than
that of Washington's birthday, with
her performance of Mignon as the at
traction. If there have been greater
Mignons than Berlindi in San Fran
cisco, ordinary memory does not run
to the time. Dramatically and vocally
she was very nearly the ideal heroine
of the gypsy camp. To see her in
Zaza and then in Mignon was a new
revelation of her wide versatility. Ba
zelll, too. the Wilhelm of the cast,
well deserved the audience. He acted
with discretion, and his singing was
such as to win the applause of the lady
with the Beethoven like face who plays
the harp in the orchestra. Francisca
did not score a success. This will be
a source of genuine regret among those
who have enjoyed her work in concert.
Cirotto, Berlindi and Baaelli fairly
electrified the audience in the closing
scene with their trio. Miss Barker won
much applause with one song. An
odd feature of the performance was
that the orchestra had to repeat two
orchestral numbers, so strong was the
demand. There has been no better
performance artistically since the
opening of the present season.

Trhste beds are women and girls who
are awaiting or recovering from opera-
tions made necessary by neglect.
Every one of these patients had
plenty of warning in that bearing down
feeling, pain at the left or right of the
womb, nervous exhaustion, pain in the
email of the back, leucorrhcea, dizzi-
ness, flatuleacy , displacements of the |
â¢womb or irregularities. All of these
â¢ymptoms are indications of an un-
healthy condition of the ovaries or
womb, and if not heeded the trouble
will make headway until the penalty
has to be paid by a dangerous opera-
tion, and a lifetime of impaired useful-
ness at best, while in many cases the
.results are fatal.
The following letter should bring
hope to suffering women. Miss Luella
Adamfi.of the Colonnade Hotel, Seattle,
Wash., writes:
Deer Mrs Pinkham:â
" About two years ago I was a great suf-
ferer from a severe female trouble, pains and
headaches Th* doctor prescribed for me an*
finally told me that I had a tumor on the
womb and must undergo an operation if I
wanted to get well. I felt that this was my
death warrant, but I spent hundreds of dol-
aw? for medical help, but the tumor kept
growing. Fortunately I corresponded with
an aunt in thÂ« Hew England States, and she
advised me to take Lydia E. Pinkham's Veg-
etable Compound, as it was. said to curs tu-
mors. I did so and immediate, began to.
Improve in health, and I was entirely cured,
the tumor disappearing entirely; without an
operation. I wish every suffering woman
would try this great preparation.' 1 |
Just as surely as Miss Adams was
cured of the troubles enumerated in
her letter, just so surely will Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound cure
every woman in the land who suffers
from womb troubles, inflammation of
the ovaries, kidney troubles, nervous
excitability and nervous prostration.
Mrs. Pinkham invites all young
women who are ill to write her for free
vice. Address, Lynn, Mass.

TEAR RINGS
FROM HER EARS
Two Chinese Crooks Enter
Home of Mrs. Wong Woo
and Strip Her of Jewels
PLAN CUNNINGLY LAID
Thieves Secure Admission
to House by Masquerad
ing as Restaurant 3len
Two Chinese robbers entered the
home of Dr. "Wong Woo at 1 Brennan
place on Tuesday night and while one
of them covered little Mrs. Wong Woo
with a pistol the other ransacked the
house. After taking what they could
find in the way of money and jewelry
the robbers seized the terrified woman
and tore a pair of earrings from her
ears.
The crime was cunningly planned.
At 9 o'clock Mrs. Wong: Woo heard a
knock at the door. "Who Is there?"
she asked.
"Your husband sends us with your
supper," was the answer, and Mrs.
Wong Woo opened the door. Two Chi
nese in American garb darted in. One
of them held a pistol to the Roman's
head and cautioned her not to make an
outcry. The other cut the wires at
tached to a telephone that communi
cated with Dr. Wong: Woo's office.
Then he searched the house thor
oughly, finding four bracelets valued
at $450, a gold watch and $58 in coin.
Not satisfied with the amount of the
booty. they seized the frightened
woman and roughly tore the earrings
from her ears. The little Chinese
â woman almost fainted from the pain,
but the revolver terrified her into
silence.
When the pair had satisfied them
selves that there was nothing of value
left in the place they warned the
woman again not to cry out, and dis
appeared. For some time Mrs. Woo
remained in the house, unable to move
because of fright. Then she hurried to
the office of her husband at 764 Clay
street ano^told him what had occurred.
She could not give the police any de
tailed description of the thieves. She
declares, however, that they were See
Tup men, as they used the dialect of
that family. The house was dimly
lighted at* the time and she could not
see their faces plainly. Detectives
Coleman and Reynolds have been de
tailed on the case.
SKULL FRACTURED DURING

Between the hours of 1 and 3 o'clock
yesterday morning William Spaulding,
a clerk; John O'Donnell, a laborer;
Francis Gormley, a laborer, and T. S.

his forehead. He was sent to the
Harbor Emergency Hospital, where it
was found that there was a slight frac
ture of the skull. He was later re
moved to the Central Emergency Hos
pital.
O'Donnell, Gormley and Van â were
detained pending the result of Spauld
ing's injuries. Detective Bralgr was de
tailed on the case. He learned that
Spaulding was acting offensively in the
cell and O'Donnell. who has only one
arm. struck or pushed him away and
he fell, his forehead striking against
theÂ» iron bars of the bell. Spaulding
told Detective Braig that he would not
prosecute O'Donnell, but he and the
others will be detained meantime.

CLEVER SOCIETY MAID
WEDS YOUNG LAWYER
Nuptial Service Quiet
IN A BOWER OF ALMOND BLOSSOMS
PROMISES ARE PLIGHTED.
Beneath a bower of almond blos
soms pretty Paula Wolff became the
bride last night of William Perm Hum
phreys. The service was read by the
Rev. William Guthrie in the drawing
room of the bride's home, only rela
tives witnessing the ceremony. To the
reception which followed 100 guests,
all close friends, were bidden.
Not during the winter has a home
been more exquisitely dressed for a
wedding. In every nook of the draw
ing-room were masses of almond blos
soms. The halls and receptions rooms
were gay with St. Joseph lilies, white
carnations, magnolias and bamboo. In
the library an arrangement of Japan
ese- flowering quince, in its naming red,
were mightily effective, while the din
ing-room was, for the night, a minia
ture orange grove. In every available
nook hung orange branches, heavy
laden with fruit and fragrant blos
scms.
The bride wore a robe of white
satin, softened with rare lace, over
which fell a lace veil â her mother's.
Attending her were Miss Helen Speyer
and Miss Arlie Humphreys, both
smartly gowned in white tulle, with
dashes of pink, and carrying Brides
maid roses.
The groom was attended by John
Zeile and Day Farquarson. Those who
sat with the bride at supper, besides
the attendants already named, were:
Mr. Chickering, Miss Stow of Santa
Barbara, Carl Wolff. Miss Alyce Sul
livan, Mr. Bertheau, Miss Plagemann,
F. W. Dohrmann.

OLD GUARD OF BOHEMIA
LISTENS TO GREETINGS
Charles Warren Stoddard Send* a
Message From Alpine Re
treat in Massachusetts.
The annual banquet to the veterans
of the Bohemian Club, which took
place Tuesday evening, called out
many interesting reminiscences. Ra
phael Weill. who will leave San Fran
lisco for Paris early next week, in
vited the old guard of Bohemia to be
his sruests at dinner. The invitation
was extended to old-time members of
the club now living in New York, Bos
ton and other distant cities. Andrew
McFarland Davis of Boston, who re
sided here In the "seventies" and took
an active part in the high jinks affairs
of the club, responded in the hap
piest style to Mr. Weill's greeting.
The following letter from the gifted
writer and poet, Charles Warren
Stoddard. who is slowly convalescing
from a long siege of sickness, will be
read with pleasure by many Califor
nians:
In the Whtte Shadows of Mount Greylock,
Uerkshire County, Macs., Feb. 16. 1905.
Dear Raphael Welll: A glad message from
dear old San Francisco has hunted me down,
and where, think you? In Little Switzerland!
It is heavenly here Just now and her* I im
having my last bout with winter.
Greylock. the highest point of land In Mas
sachusetts, is frosted to the tip, and as from
my broad western window I look upon It I
think of the summer land beyond â the land I
hope to enter and call home once more, and
that ' some time in April.
Look across your flower-laden banquet board,
my brothers, and listen for a moment!
Here there Is rosy 'Enow at sunrise among
baby Alpine peaks and violet snow at sunset
In silver vales, and .there Is mow upon snow
everywhere â snow as fine as flour and as dry
as bone dust, so that you cannot make a
snowball of it. But out of the "gTeat white
silence" I greet you with a tropical aloha
tliat need not be put upon the Ice to keep
forever. Fire and frost are as one to the
tcuch. but O, the difference to me!
A health to you, my brothers! Please God,
in a little -while I shall see you and It shall
be with us as If we had never aaid "good-by."
Faithfully and affectionately,
CHARLES WARREN STODDARD.
Greylock Rest. Adanis. Mass.

PARK ATTRACTS
MIGHTY THRONG
People's Playground Draws
Thousands of Holiday
Makers Away From City
GEAND SPEING OPENING
Nature Presents a Splendid
Treat to the Celebrants
of Washington's Birthday
Decked in vernal beauty, Oolden Oate
Park presented rare attractiveness to
yesterday's holiday-makers. Nature
seemed, to have made special prepara
tion for the gladdening of the thou
sands that visited the great public
playground.
Copious rains had greened the
swards and foliage and a generous sun
enhanced their brilliance. The daisy
spangled lawns were dry enough to
romp upon without conveying their
hue to the garments of the rompers,
and the driveways, bicycle and foot
paths never were in better trim.
In addition to all the everyday at
tractions there was a special band
concert largely irfade up of patriotic
selections. Leila France's ringing air,
"The Old Flag Forever," opened the
programme, and the instrumentalists
interpreted its swinging measure with
a vim that started multitudinous feet
to rhythmic stamping. Thiel's inspir
ing march, "American Republic," also
provoked unconscious accompaniment.
It was officially said that the number !
of vehicles in evidence broke the best .
previous record. Indeed so numerous i
were wheeled conveyances of many I
kinds, to say nothing of the equestri- j
ans, that it was difficult, if Hot danger- j
ous, to cross any of the wide boule- j
yards. If there was an automobile in ;
San Francisco that was not also in the
park the machine must have been in- I
capacitated for service. Nor would It
be extravagant to say the same of the .
livery buggies and carriages. As for
private rigs of various styles, from the ,

SAILOR MEETS
TRAGIC DEATH
Stricken Suddenly While
Following a Waitress Out
of a Barbary Coast Saloon
"Sailor Jack," belonging to the
schooner Diamond Dollar, familiar in
Barbary Coast resorts, dropped dead In
the L. and L.. saloon, 525 Pacific street,
shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday morn
ing. The police suspect that he may
have been a victim of "knock-out
drops." May Randell and Brolly DeÂ«
mond, who had been drinking with,
him, were arrested and locked up
pending development*.
About 2 o'clock May Randall, who 1Â»
employed as a waitress in the Stras
burg dance hall, 901^ Kearoy street,
entered the L. and L. saloon with the
sailor. She called for a bottle of beer
and she and Violet Wood, a friend,
drank the contents. The sailor sat be
side them, but did not partake of the
beer. May Randell, wlio appeared to
be anxious to get rid of the sailor, left
the saloon hurriedly. He rose to fol
low her, but had only taken a few
steps when he dropped dead.
The body was removed to the Morgue
and the police were notified. De
tectives Reynolds and Coleman ar
rested the two women on suspicion of
having drugged the man with the in
tention of robbing him. He had been
drinking a good deal with both women.
Dr. L. D. Bacigalupi made an au
topsy on the body at the Morgue. He
came to the conclusion that death was
due to cerebral hemorrhage as the
brain was much inflamed. As a mat
ter of precaution the stomach has been
sent to the City Chemist for analysis.

Charles Lawrence, a longshoreman,
who lived on Madison avenue, died at
the City and County Hospital Tuesday
night and his body was removed to the
Morgue yesterday morning. Dr. L. D.

On the night of September 17 Law
rence was thrown out of B. E. Boett
ger's saloon at Sixth and Folsom
streets by Paul Boettger, a brother of
the proprietor, and fell. The back of
his head struck against the sidewalk.
He was taken to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where he was treated
for a lacerated wound of the scalp and
possible fracture of the skull. He was
later sent to the City and County Hos
pital, where the skull was trephined.
Paul Boettger was arrested at the
time by Policemen La Grange and Mc-
Entee on a charge of assault to do
great bodily harm. He was released
o?i $50 cash ball, but failed to appear
in Police Judge Mogan's court. His
bail was forfeited and a bench war
rant issued for his arrest. It is be
lieved that he is now in Mexico. The
police have not yet decided what ac
tion to take.
Knocked Ont by Wood Alcohol.
Eugene Kelly, who lives at Third
and Perry streets, went on a wood al
cohol Jamboree Tuesday night, and
early yesterday morning was picked
up at 816 Sacramento street uncon
scious. The surgeons at the Harbor
hospital diagnosed the case as
"knock-out drops," and after two
hours' heroic treatment Kelly was
arfused from his stupor. He col
lapsed again a few hours later, but
again revived. His condition is se
rious, but he may recover. Kelly's
mother visited him at the hospital
yesterday afternoon and explained
tfhat her son had a thirst which only
straight alcohol would assuage.
