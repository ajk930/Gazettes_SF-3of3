brokerage linn, declared to-night that the
failure would cause little excitement on.
the Chicago Board- of Trade. or the New-
York Stock Exchange to-morrow morn
ing, as the trades were so evenly" bal
anced that the transactions on the long
â¢Eide of the market would to a great ex
tent offset the trades en the short side:
"For every transaction made by the
firm," said Whitney, -"the Chicago banks
hold collateral, and if the banks sell out
at the present market price money will
be sained instead of lost." . ...
The petition for the appointment of a
receiver sets forth that if an attempt be
not immediately made to realize on the
$250,000 worth of transactions the deal will
necessarily have to.be closed j out at a
great sacrifice.
. R. H. Donnelly, "senior, member of the

be harmed financially, but he refused to
givÂ« any reason for the failure of j the

"As nearly as I can estimate to-night,
our liabilities are about $250,000 and our
assets aJ-/Out $100,000. . This estimate is
made by taking as a basis the closing
prices of stocks and grain to-day. " As
soon as Receiver Potter cleans up our af
fairs the firm of Knight, Donnelly & Co.
will b e dissolved."

"I understand." said Dr. Cain, "that
Secretary Hay's present Illness is of a
different kind from that for which Le
\u25a0rent abroad for treatment and for which
h<- took the baths at Bad Nauheim.
Should attacks such as he has experi
enced yesterday occur frequently, there
is no doubt that there would be
for grave anxiety, bup Mr.
Hay seems to have got clear of all danger
la the present Instance."
Just before noon lt was reported from
Secretary Hay's bedside that the patient
v.as "resting comfortably, with \u25a0â¢every
thing favorable." Dr. 1 Scudder later gave
out the following bulletin:
"Mr. Hay is suffering from the effects
of a chill caught on the journey from
Washington. The attack Is . similar, to
one he had* four years a gv. Mr. Hay is
resting comfortably and expects Â«o be
ebout In a few days. No further, bulle
tin? will be -Issued." \u25a0
This evening Clarence Hay, son of the
Secretary, saidt "It has been a very
day. There seems to be no
o tited of further anxiety."
Dr. Cain said to-day that the members
cf Mr. Hay's family were greatly alarmed
because the usual remedies failed to give
relief.
Secretary Hay first experienced pain
early yesterday. Remedies which have
jriven relief on previous occasions were
applied, but failed to help him, and Dr.
Cain was called from Newport. He found
that in changing from the climate of
Washington to the cooler temperature of
the Lake Sunapee region, the Secretary
had taken a severe cold, and that his
organs, weakened by previous attacks,
had been affected. Upon learning this,
Mrs. Hay desired that specialist! be sum
moned at once and as soon as possible
Doctors Scudder and Murphy were on the
way hereby special train from Boston.'
The BoEton and Maine Railroad cleared
its tracks from Boston to Concord, X.
H., and the .special made fast time be-,
twecn these two cities. The train then
proceeded to Ncwbury by the Concord
and Claremont branch. A launch was in
waiting to convey the surgeons across
Lake Sunapee and the doctors reached
the bedside of the Secretary at about
midnight. A quick but complete exami
nation of the patient was made and it
vi as seen that his condition, while ex
ceedingly* painfitf, was not for the time
at least scriou^. Under treatment the
patient soon sliowed Improvement and
the necessity of an operation, which had
been discussed, was averted.
During the latter part of the night
Secretary _Hay grew steadily better and
by morning had regained the strength
vliich had been exhausted by hours of
incessant pain. The physicians ruled,
however, that the Secretary should re
main in bed for a day or two. .

SPBCIAIi TRAIN FOR DOCTORS.
NEWBURY. N. H., June 26.â The con
dition of Secretary of State John Hay.
Â« - ho if= confined to his bed at his sum
mer home near Lake Sunapee by an at
tack of uraemia, was regarded as favor
able to-night by his physicians. After a
tew- days of rest, it is expected the Secre
tary will be able to leave his room. .''.
Dr. Charles U Scudder of the Massa
chusetts General Hospital In Bos.ton. .wfco
came heie with Dr. Fred T. ilurphy ot
Boston on Sunday night -on a special
train in response to a message from the
family, remained in the village to-aight.
but Dr. Murphy returned home. Dr. J.
T. Cain of Newport, N. H., who was
called to ths Hay home' before the ar
rival of the Boston physicians, is with
Isr. Scudder. Both doctors are of the
opinion that Mr. Hay will have no dif
ficulty in overcoming the effects of the
attack. An operation was considered at,
one time by Dr. "Cain*, but the three
physicians.-- after a careful examination,
and a consultation, docided it would not
be necessary. The attack was due to a
chill caught on the journey from Wash-*
lngton and is similar to one that Mr. Hay
had four years ago.
The Secretaty passed a comfortable
afternoon and evening and his family
considered that there is no need of fur
ther anxiety. Secretary Hay arrived at
his summer home on Saturday night.
The present trouble Is all -the more
sudden and the more unexpected, com
ing on the, heels of the good impres
sion produced by the Emperor's recep
tion of the Zemetvoists -and; his- prom-,

The German ship Agnes of Bremen
was destroyed by fire last March oft
Cape Horn. Cr.. tain and crew fought
the flames for more than a week. When
hope of saving the ship was given; up,
hatches were battened down and a
course laid for. the land. The vessel
was not abandoned until her steel sides
were red hot and her whole inside a
fiery furnace. In three boats the offi
cers and men of the Agnes left the
blazing shell, which had been their
home, and headed for Cape Horn, fifty
five miles. away. One of these boats,
containing the captain -and ten mem
bers of the crew, was picked -up by the
American clipper ship Aryan, which
Then, came the realization that the
fight, was , ; hopeless.'- The second mate
went below to investigate.'. He .was drag
ged on deck, unconscious. If was three
hours before he regained his senses. Cap
tain Behrens was with him when, he
opened his eyes. \u25a0 His first 'words .were:
"Hopeless; only chance ls \u25a0â..' to '.batten
everything down and run for the land."
By this time the Agnes was" getting
pretty hot. On â¢ March IS there was ; a
terrific explosion and the* .main hatch
went sailing over the fore topsail yard.
After this the .flames had; everything
their .own .way. and. on/. March ( _ 20 ; the
boats were manned and launched. rCap
tain Behrens, the second mate,; boatswain*
and sailmaker remained ;on 1 board ? the
Agnes. -. The I rest 'of ; the' ship's : company
There was no rest for anybody on the
Agnes* after that. Day and night all
hands strove' to subdue the flames, but
the seamen's efforts seemed only to, fan
the devouring element, and ' inch by inch
it consumed the inflammable freight and
fastened with relentless grip on the ship
itself. . > .
It was with great difficulty that the
seat of the fire was located. When the
fore hatch was opened there was found
a little smoke, but neither fire nor heat.
The main hatch was opened and thero
the smoke was' thicker, but the [ther
mometer showed no alarming condition
of temperature. As the smoke con r
tinued to pour through the ventilators
it was decided to investigate the coal,
which lay below a layer of coke. About
four tons of coke was .thrown over
board and. then it. was seen that the
coal on the port side was ablaze and
burning fiercely.

arrived here yesterday with the sur
vivors on board. Within a'few minutes
after the Aryan had picked up the-cap
tain's boat there broke a terrific storm,
whiah the stout steel Aryan weathered
with difficulty and in which it is feared
the other two boats from the Agnes
must have i>erished.
ThÂ« Agnes was bound from Shields
for Valparaiso and from the outset of
the voyage the elements treated her,
roughly. She was loaded with coke
and coal, having about 900 tons of the
latter.- On March 12 smoke was dis
covered coming from the forward venti
lator. â¢ The Agnes then was in latitude
69 degrees 30 minutes south, longitude
76 degrees west. . .

During the recital of Robertson's tes

evidence at mental agony. He writhed In

Robertson underwent a severe cross
examination "by Senator Thurston, but
the defense could not .shake his testi

at 2:O p. m.
Upon bains subpenaed to appear before
the Grand Jury, the witness said he
went to Senator Mitchell and showed him
the HUrimons, asking the Senator what
he could be wanted in Portland for. The
Senator said It was to testify about the
accounts of the law firm of Mitchell &
Tanner and told him that Tanner and

direct. He Identified tne letter given him
by Mitchell at \Vashington to be delivered
to Tanner, but which was given to Prose

WHY DOCTORS FAIL
AKO MRS. PINKHAM SUCCEEDS
Plain Reasons Are Here Given* to Explain
WbyLydia E. Pinkham'B Vegetable Com-
pound Cures When Doctors Are Powerless
A woman is sick: somedfsease peculiar
to her sex is fast deveiopicg- in her sys-
tem. She goes to her family physician
and tells him a story, but not the whole
Etory.
She holds something back, loses her
head, becomes agitated, forgets what
the wants to say, and finally conceals
what she ought to have told, and thus
completely mystifies the doctor.
â¢â¢Is it any wonder, therefore, that the
doctors fail to cure the disease ? Still
we cannot "blame the woman; for it is
very embarrassing, to detail some of the
symptoms of her suffering 1 , even to her
family physician.
It was for this reason that years ago
Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn; Mass. , de-
termined to step in and help her sex.
Having had considerable experience in
treating female ills with her Vegetable
Compound, she encouraged the women
of America to write to her for advice in
regard to their complaints, and being a
woman, it was easy for her ailing sis-
ters to pour into her ears every detail
of their suffering. .
In this way she was able to do "for
them what the physicians were unable
to do, simply . because . she had the
proper information to work upon, and
from the little group of tromenjwho
sought ter. advice years, ago' a v great
army of her .fellow-beings are ,to-day
constantly applying for advice and re-
lief, and the fact, that many thou-
sands of them have been, cured by
following the advice . of Mrs. Pinkham
during the last year is indicative of the
grand results which are \u25a0 produced by
her unequal ed experience and training.
No physician in the world has had
such a training, or has such an amount
of information at hand to assist in the
treatment of all kinds of female ills,
from the simplest ; local irritation to
the most complicated womb diseases.
This, therefore, is theâ¢ reason "why
Mrs. Pinkham, in her laboratory at
Lynn,' Mass., is able to do more for the
ailing women of America/ than v the ,
family physician. / Any woman, there-
fore, is responsible for her own suffer-
ing who will not take the trouble, to
write to Mrs; Pinkham for advice. -
"Z Tbe testimonials which "we are " con-
fcttntly publishing from grateful wo-
men establish' beyond, a doubt the.
power of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable';
Compound to conquer. ieauJe disease*.

You never can tell, as G. B. Shaw says.
"Rahson's Folly" looked ; all . right to me
last night until T. Daniel Frawley, sug
gested that it wasn't. , Nor did there seem
to be anything the matter. with the]audi
ence. True, there might, have been'more
of us, but the hay lies. golden. in the. sun,
and Mr. Frawley .Is | butâ Mr. ; Frawley.
However, I for. one never felt worse about
not being- twins ;than ; last; night. - r llr.
Frawley was 5 too pathetic | ror | anything
about the large assemblage that did not
greet him. Mr. Frawley, was pathetic and
grieved | all round.':; He A't elt blue" about
coming. again to the Columbia stage, 'that
ten years -and one pathetic month' ago
he baptized, with not one old face in his
present company. - He spoko of the;clever
folk that .then surrounded him, that had
made the . "Frawley , name J mean ., s6me
thing In the West"â and those' of . us'who
had brought a . mere mouchoir, instead lof
a hanky . began to feel 'alarmed. 'Most
of -: us felt ; ashamed, too. j We had been
heartlessly enjoying ourselves. '.We had
thought Mr. Frawley was, too. We had
given him a handsome hand when he ap
peared. \u25a0\u25a0'â¢': We, had given ( him another fend
another for good work In a role that suits
him. We * had * had all . kinds: of fun j and
thrills:. out s of .the play. We had 'seen
one good . actor after . another tumble into
his part, and when .we called out Timothy
Daniel after the third act we thought he
would tell is ; that though he had Just
been around , the world, "there was no
place like,", etc. ; that -j "he was glad ;to
see; us again'!;, that -"he thanked us. for
our kyind reception of himself and his
company," etc., and a ; happy, etc. '
But no! Mr. Frawley -informed hi 3
"friends and; countrymen that he
didn't.., want to come X back' here ,undei"
these, .conditions. Theatrical â¢ condi
tions here.'Vhe said, "were. now 'at. their
worst. -.The relations between the press
and the theaters were ; strained; 'every
thing was at its unfavorablest. 'Even
the summer 1 had butted in." , and* then
he told, us again that _we were not the
biggest audience he had seen. Still he
knew that we "wanted ' him under, the
right conditions. He hoped to come
backr'under more/ prosperous:, condi
tions," and then the curtain covered
Mr. Frawley, and his sorrows.
But even If Mr. Frawley is not now
a managerial .. Napoleon and other
things are' equally .unfortunate, the
heartless audience cannot - escape a
good time : -with, "Ranson's Folly." it
is a dramatization of Richard Harding
Davis* j good story of, the name, and
three times better as "a play, than as a
story. It tells In swift, gripping, fash
ion the tale of â¢ Ranson's Vfolly," -the
practical joke of a young , army, officer
who, for a wager, holds up a stage with
a pair of scissors, and the sensational
consequence. rThef;Scene j ..is"4flja.^. / aEmy
post In Arizona, and everything 'lends
illusion, j . One j might .go far, ;to f find a
more skillfully : acted and '^written din
ner - scene than ' the mess, dinner! \u25a0at
which the wild young officer, bored to
death 1 by the ' InacUvity of his ;'; J life,
makes \u25a0 the i wager.-: The i lovemaking ' is
a pretty and convincing element, . and
you T get a genuine -catch of the breath
at the hero's predicaments. \u25a0 Mr. Fraw
ley is well" cast' as;Ranson. ; - Though
not exactly a Hotspur, he achieves a
good deal of fire and an unusual'geni
ality. The close-mouthed, resourceful,
nonchalant character is grateful to
him, and he will be, enjoyed therein. V
There is an excellent , company in * sup
port! " Mary Cahill . is very prettily and
sincerely acted by Eleanor Montell. ' The
work lacks a .shade of : simplicity, â¢\u25a0: but
Miss Montell has tenderness l and delight
ful girllshness. The | lieutenant owning
the brogue, whether, it be Eghert Peters
or Walter ; Crosby, -.is an honor to ' j the
accent. There is a very good "bad man"
in Charles \u25a0 Sturgls as ' Abe - Case and
another, in James McKean.' ; W. H. ; Bur
ton and Frazer Coulter as Colonel Bol
land. axyj- Captain | Chase would be j given
command on- sight any where. 7 And the
realistic note Is capitally, struck through
out, save by, Mark-. Price as j Jeft '. Cahill.
Mr. Price cannot' wholly forget that? he
is' acting. Grace:;de. Witt contributes a
'delightful bit' of comedy as Mrs. "Post, 1
the old ; lady who tells of â¢ the hold-up,
and the rest fill in with' all needful art.
The piece Is ' put on excellently ' and can
be handsomely recommended. â¢

that his sire had been seen in Houston.
He wrote to the postmaster of that city
and received the address of a C. H.
Bergstrom. He communicated with his
namesake, and a few letters convinced
them of their relationship.
Bergstrom, the father, imparted the
information to his son that he had mar

he had reared another family.. He in

and the younger Bergstrom plans to

niCH RECI.USE KILLS HIMSELF.
BERKELEY, June 26. â Charles
fichnelle, an aged German living alone
at California and Rose streets in North
Berkeley, committed suicide this after
noon by sending a bullet from a re
volver through his head. He used a
email mirror, evidently, to insure the
accuracy of hts aim. the glass being
found at his feet. Schnelle settled
himself comfortably in an old rocking
chair, crossed his logs and then fired.
The revolver fell Into his lap: D - e
epondency, caused by old age and in
temperate habits, is supposed trf have
inspired the act.
Schnelle Â«vas a wealthy widower, who
lived practically alone for many years.
He owned valuable real estate,- scat
tered through West and ixorth Berke
ley. His holdings are estimated to be
worth about J..-.000. He leaves -a
grandson. J. Schnolle. Schnelle s son
died several years ago. A trunk, which
is supposed ,to contain .the .pld man's
papers, was turned over, to Deputy, Cor
oner Strelghtif at the grandson Â« request.
* ALAMEDA, June 26.â After believing
"for twenty years that his*father was.
dead, Fred Bergstrom, a plumber of
this city, "has discovered his sire in
Houston. Tex., where the man so long
J thought to be dead is engaged -in the
tailoring business.
; According to the younger Berg
strom, his father left him and his
'mother twenty years ago, when - the
young man was but a child, and all ef
forts to fathom the mystery of the
disappearance proved fruitless. Sirs.
Bcrgstrom mourned her husband as
, tU'ad, and bravely set out to make a
living for herself and little son. She
raised the boy to manhood, and two
years ago passed to her final reward.
Fred Bcrgstrom learned from friends

Professor H. Morse Stephens declared
thfet the most important work to be done
In CaMfornia is the education of adults.
He deplored the nttitude of adults who
think they have completed the work of
educating themselves, and styled this a
."hideous" idea. He spoke of the two
classes of students at the summer school
as "thirsters" and "taster?" and urged
that the former class be favored.
Professor Ludwlg Boltzmann arrived
from Vienna this afternoon and with a
large number of other educators from
the tast established headquarters at
Cloyue court, close to the university. In
the court are found Professor J. Mark
Baldwin of Johns Hopkins University:

Miss May Sutton of Pasadena. Call
is , considered likely to v take back the
ladies* championship to -America.-. Miss
Sutton has been scoring great successes
in the.northern. meetings, -and Miss
Douglas, the presertt champion, has in
jured her wrist and is unable to defend
the title. ~v ; '.
In the first round of the doubles Ward
and Wright will play Evans and* Nav
rogordatol, and ; Lamed and Clothier
will play Hiller. and Larsen.
The Welshman: took the first set
rather easily and five straight games in
the second, .Ward tiring. / In the third
set. however. Ward made a superb ral
ly, â¢ and the score reached' "games 'all."
When Ward was serving deuce was
called nine times. Ward was winning,
but he seemed , fagged and lost the next
three games and the match. \u25a0
William A, Lamed, T. â¢ C. Wright and
J. W. Clothier, the' Americans, all won
in the second I round, Lamed j especially
showing good form, but in no, case. did
their opponents call: for particular .ex
tension. Ward's ; game against Smith
was, of course, -the attraction of t the
day. < \u25a0\u0084 . \u25a0 - '-\u25a0 â\u25a0
a better game. He appeared to be able
to stand the extreme . pace better than
Ward, whose serves several times failed
to break effectively. .
Holcombe Ward, the American national
.awn tennis champion and the winner
last week of the championship of the
tity of London, in the first round of
Ihe all-England tournament at Wimble
lon to-day brought much : Joy to the
DrlOsh camp. The contest, in which
k. H. Smith, the Welsh champion, was
Victorious, was probably- the fastest
ever seen in England.
Ward was not quite up to his last
week's form, attributable, perhaps, to
the stiff work of the last two da#s. but
. It Is conceded that Smith never played

Sullivan was out here training Gans
for the latter's fight -with Britt,, but at
that time he was. considered a busher
and no one paid : much, attention ; to
him. But since' then Sullivan has' met
and defeated a number Jof good men.
The performance which brought' him
before the public was": his bout with
Nelson, in which" he is credited-* with
making the Dane look sick for six
rounds.
Herford claims Sullivan had all the
better of the go and -that Nelson was
lucky .to escape 1 with' a draw. : He ; says
Sullivan showed ; championship 'form
that night, beating; Nelson at his own
game.' Herford- claims the ;Dane : en
tered the ring weighing about seven
pounds more than Sullivan and that
Billy Nolan, ; Nelson's manager, 1 refused
to sign forya ten-round' mill. . > :
Sullivan 'i -will start training* right
away. Herford does not like the beach
as a place to. condition a boxer, so it is
likely he will: take-his charge to Sari
Rafael or Alamcda. ''\u25a0 Sullivan will have
no trouble making the weight, as he is
able to fight. at 128 pounds at Â§ o'clock.
Herford says he has had no under
standing with Britt as to the ; weight
as yet, but from hisUone it would.ap
pear that he wants Britt to do less than
132 pounds at 6 o'clock. Herford will
leave for , Reno '.on 'Sunday night to
witness the '> Root-Hart fight. Joe Gans
will arrive in â¢ about a week to help
condition the Washington boxer.
Kid Sullivan of ; . Washington, D. C,
chaperoned : by Al'Herford,' arrived last
night : to ; get , ready "for;, Jimmy -i Britt.
The -little man! from the capital as
dumb as the - sphynx, , leaving all the
talking to Herford, who is: experienced
In V that V line.' and* .can -dispense 'the
eloquence for any .fighter in the
business. -â¢'.â¢..â¢"â¢ \u25a0-;' - . . â¢ ? , ;";
' -Sullivan. and' Brltt will battle: before
the Hayes Valley Club: at .Woodward's
Pavilion on July IS. Herford claims
his boy is 'the best, light weight, now on
the boards in the East and is willing, to
risk quite a bunch of coin^that he will
administer ;to Britt ; his - "first defeat
when J the men' step into the ring. ' \u25a0 â¢'-
Sullivan is not as la.rge as Britt by
far, standing but - five~ feet, in height.
But he is a, stocky, lad and; one of the
kind who . will wade in and take an
awful beating. He is alsocredited with;
being, there; with the necessary punch

that it is enough sometimes to be a good
listener in order to be a most successful
hostess. The following typical anecdote
proves this! . Gomberville, the old cour

to be paying a great deal of attention to

"She is not. graceful/?
"Not very.",..
"Sha is not witty."
"No, not particularly." '

"She can listen . admirably."â Professor

NOW FOR THE GLORIOUS FOURTH.
a-VECRETARY TAFT'S statement in behalf .of Chinese mer
chants and other 'exempt classes was widely misunderstood or
S**i misrepresented as an attack on the Chinese. exclusion law. That
law' is aimed solely and only at Chinese ' laborers. Its purpose_is
plainly indicated both affirmatively and negatively. It- names specifi
cally 'the class to be excluded, and the classes to be exempt from
exclusion. If was in behalf- of these that Secretary Taft made his
statement, and the policy he indicated toward them -no more,en
dangered the exclusion law than it did the position of equinox and
solstice,.
c c .AVhat tie said and what the President has done were made nec
essary by an event that is entirely distinct from the Chinese boycott
of .American merchandise. When our Supreme Court the
wnfc-of habeas corpus to Chinese, even though born in this country,
; a great power was deposited with the administrative officers of the
Government. Their decision as to the human rights of Chinese was
*made conclusive and final. As far as Chinese were concerned they
jwere placed where all men were before the habeas corpus was devised
to give a man his day in court, and enable a judicial examination
and determination of his rights. It is no reflection upon any officer
to say that such power in the executive is subject to abuse. It always
was. "abused, and its abuse was the original reason for putting the
rights of man in the keeping of the courts by the writ of habeas
corpus.
Thi purpose of the President is to so safeguard the use of
this executive power that it will not be abused. It is easily seen
that the learned Judge who wrote the extraordinary decision of the
court, if he arrived here" on a steamer from China, could be deported*
as a Chinese, by the Immigration Bureau. It would be in vain for
hinj to protest that he was not .a Chinese. He could prove that only
by getting inlo court, and he could get into court only by a writ of
habeas corpus, for which his petition would-be promptly. denied un
der his -own decision. Xor would it be possible to punish the officer
who excluded him, for an offense could nor be proved except in
court, and the courts are closed against such proof. - , -"
'The decision caused a crisis before unknown in American af
fairs, judging by the past, it endangered our reputation for human
atyind fair play, and amply justified the President in coming to the
rescue of the country's reputation. Theretofore members of the ex
.enipt classes had been held by the Immigration Bureau to be guilty
of violating the exclusion act, and were called- upon, under circum
stances that made compliance impossible, to prove themselves inno
ctnt: It is" the plain intention of the treaty and the law that a sec
tion-6 certificate, vised by a consular or diplomatic officer of our
Gdv-ernmer.t in China, shall be prima facie evidence of the right of
- air.exempt to land here. The practice, however, hajs voided the cer
tificate as such evidence, and exempts were -put under every con
ceivable disadvantage. It is no wonder that under such circum
stances Chinese merchants in China turned their backs upon our
commerce, and threatened its complete exclusion from their country
by using that negative resistance of which they are the masters.
The situation aroused the greatest solicitude of our merchants.
Their anxiety was treated in some quarters as evidence of their
enmity to the exclusion law, and their willingness to sacrifice Ameri
can* labor in the interest of our foreign trade. If this expressed a
creal fear it .was without foundation. The interests of American
labor and American trade are inseparably united. The: abandon
ment of hope for the extension of our trade in Eastern Asia would
be to American labor the hardest blow it has ever suffered. Espe
cially would this be true of. the labor onthis^coaft and;in the CQtton
raising and cotton manufacturing districts of the South. American
labor .produces a surplus that is not needed at home. It must find
Â°a market abroad. Europe is taking as much of*that surplus as can
be reasonably expected to find a' market there. - It is the, policy of
our. Government and our people to get a fair share of the; expanding
trade- of Eastern Asia. To that end our State Department safe
guarded the open door in China,, and protected the neutrality of that
empire.
â¢ The Government has done all that it could to secure for our com
merce a right of way, leaving the rest to the energy and enterprise
of our merchants, who, in their turn, appreciated their dependence
upon Chinese merchants settled here and their influence upon their
class in China. A policy of contempt, outrage, and humiliation
toward merchants and the exempt classes meant the complete, de
struction of our Chinese trade and the consequent' injury of Amer
ican labor. The President has come to the rescue by ordering our
Consuls and Minister to their duty of making a section 6 certificate,
in the hands of an exempt, prima facie evidence of the right to land
as the law intends it should be. 'Offenses in regard to that certificate
are charged against native officials in China. When they find -that
our representatives precede a- vise of a certificate by a validating ex
amination, the native officials will find it in vain to attempt frauds/
and their Government will co-operate with ours in giving the cer
tificate its proper character.
The act of the President is highly commendable, and nowhere
should commendation be more generous than on this coast. It is the
first step taken by our Government to give China equality; of treat
ment with the other nations. That policy is a necessity if we are to
have the trade necessary to the prosperity of our people. Eastern
Asia is to us what Europe is to the commerce of the Atlantic sea
board. Our commercial rivals are quick to djscern any disadvantage
,to us arising in national policy, and they quickly occupy any ground
that we lose. Such mischief is easily done, but is hard to- remedy.
Out of the force of our own prejudices we may. learnj,to judge,of-the
power of prejudice among others. A set prejudice: fixed in China
against American commerce would be hard^to eradicate, and the
President's action is, we hope, in time to prevent it.
His confidence in the integrity of .our consular, service 'is not
misplaced. Our representatives in China will be /ound alert in pro
tecting the exclusion act against violation, and in extending the
intended benefits of the law to the exempts.
The Chinese Government will doubtless be found responsive
to this policy of a square deal, and as it has immense power over
the commercial class, it will doubtless see to it that the anti-Ameri
can agitation shall cease. / \u25a0;\u25a0,;â¢ â¢,

ANGELA MORGAN
In striking contrast to the saving habit of this society dame is the cus
tom of another leader of fashion. in the same city, who never keeps any of
her costumes after-wearing them one season. : . : "\u25a0\u25a0'.' '":': t ;
Noted for her exquisite taste in dress and reputed 'to spend as much
as $30,000 a year on her clothes, she disposes of every costume at the end
of each season and purchasesjan entirely; new ; outfit. â¢ V
Of course, such a practice seems the wildest extravagance to the aver
age woman.; Yet the woman under discussion \ is rich and can afford to give
away her things just as soon as fashion calls for another style. -
Is she extravagant? lam told that the beautiful garments she disposes
of. go where they are most needed-â that many J a, struggling ; young singer,
or actress, or artist, is, through her 'generosity, enabled to possess a charm
ing wardrobe. " .\u25a0':\u25a0. ;. \u25a0\u25a0 ,\u25a0;\u25a0-; 'â¢\u25a0â¢;. /â¢- *-\u25a0 ;\u25a0â. .\u25a0 . . \u25a0\u25a0; .; : ' .\u25a0".'
Don't. permit your trunks and your consciousness to . be burdened with
useless possessions. Like ancient beliefs and wornout traditions they ought
to be discarded. ;\, ,': - ; ,
-It isa time of trial and' temptation towoman, for no matter how, faith
fully she promises "herself that, she will; get rid. of the things she does not
need, her s resolution* is no match for' the natural inclination * which \u25a0 urges
h er Ito : s tore away; garment j upon' garment [ in J. the f fond 1 delusion | that | some
day she will -have use for' them
all. ':..:\u25a0 ;\ ' .'. ./. '\u25a0 .. .. , '
Of : course, she never will.* ;l Tear
after year will go by and only in
imagination will the garments in
question ever be used again.. The
trunks and boxes will overflow and
meanwhile ; there -will be . needy
families suffering for' the' apparel
going to; waste in '. her storeroom.
j Perhaps no other occasion in the
housekeeper's experience calls : for
greater firmness and determination
than this, 'and if - she only would,"
every woman could make |it an op
portunity for the? development of
these necessary character/qualities."
Women have ' a ;- penchant for
clinging to their belongings, even
when the articles have outgrown
their usefulness. , Nor are men by
any means exempt from this weak
ness. It seems ; to be a tendency
of; human beings to burden them
selves with^possessionsâ to incum
ber themselves with ."things."
The prevailing idea that keeping
a clutch upon one's belongings de
notes an economical disposition is
entirely erroneous." Such \u25a0 habit
indicates, rather, a miserly spirit.
Reduced'; to its exact analysis the
Instinct is identical with the reluc
tance felt by a stingy nature in
parting with a dollar., A.
. Because one's belongings repre
sent money is no reason one should
hoard them after they are no longer
useful. The practice is an evidence
of ' selfishnessâ an ' Indulgence ; ' of
weaknessâ and needs !to be 'cut off
like any other unwtfrthy habit.
So much of the care and worry
suffered by human beings is self
imposed. Trunks and chests cramm e< i with useless things are silent wit
nesses to. such self-inflicted responsibility.: - ",
In a certain city there is a society leader who makes a practice of
keeping all her cast-off clothing. She has had a room built especially. for
that purpose, and hung about upo n its walls are allthe costumes she has
worn' from young 'womanhood to the present.^ ; v '" \u25a0 ."
Not only her dresses and wraps are preserved/ but "also her shoes and
hats, and other accessories. The room' ls, of course, quite a curiosity -shop,
and no doubt serves to amuse the lady and her guests when other forms of
entertainment prove a bore.
THIS is a season of the year that calls for t the exercise of will , power
and common sense on the. part /of housewives i- who, putting â¢: away

Frank Evans, who pocketed and re
fused to return a ball that flew over
the fence -at Eighth and Harrison
street* while a league game was In
progress last Sundays afternoon. Per
sons who capture and restore stray
spheres are" permitted to enter the
grounds, but Mr. Evans \u25a0 evidently con
sidered a $1.25 ball in'the pocket worth
more than a seat on the bleachers, for
he obstinately declined to: give up his

petty i larceny. , , : .
Hubert M. Llpman (colored) declared
he was actuated' solely by a spirit of
fun when he stole the can of milk, but
Judge" Cabanlss failed to see the Joke
and fined him $10. To prove that he
was' not a. professional larcenist Mr.
Lipman presented to the court a black
card inscribed with these words in sil
ver letters: "Let's get acquainted. Out
for a good -time. Address. 321 . Ellis
street. Hubert M. Llpman, millionaire.
Worth $5,000,000 and; looking for some
one to" love." J He^ volunteered the ad
ditional Information' that he was em
ployed at 209 Taylor street as a tailor's
pressman. But the fine stuck.
"Oh, dafs all right, all right," said
"Billy." grinning amiably; - '.'it'll be all
de same 100 years frum dis date.",
"You shall not walk out without 'ah
escort for six months from this date,"
said his Honor.
"Naw," was the reply; '.1 fought ye
was troo wld me 'en I jes*- walked out."
and yon like so many sheep when the
coyote scent comes down the breeze.
The excitement quickly extended to the
lower floor, of course, and there It. was
the hapless "Billy" met recapture -vhiie
freedom was almost within arm-reachT
He was dashing from the staircase to
the swinging front doors when Patrol
man McGrain saw 'him. heard the din
overhead and Instantly divined Its
cause. He rushed for "Billy" and sure
ly would have got him if Patrolman
Mitchell had not entered the door and
received the fugitive in his anna.
"What did you run away forâ to get
your fine?" the Judge facetiously in
quired when Mr. Montgomery was're
set before him. - - . .
The clerk was directed to notify all
contractors furnishing supplies to the
city to file their claims as soon after
the close of the fiscal year as possible.
The board allowed the sum of $1000
out of the urgent necessity fund for
the pirtial purchase of land from the
Pacific Improvement Company for the
widening and- straightening out of
Tenth, Brannan- "and Division streets.
The company has offered to sell the
land for $4500, the sale .to Include, a
withdrawal of the suits r brought
a&ainet the city for possession of a
portion taken some time ago by the
street authorities on the east side of
Tenth and Division streots. The com
pany has placed the deed for the prop
erty in escrow with a bank subject to
delivery within one year on payment of
$4500 by the city. -The balance of $3500
will 'be. made up out of next year's
funds.. The City Attorney'was requested
for "an opinion as to the right of the
board jLo purchase the land.
/ The .sum of $2500 was also set aside
out of the urgent fund for the pur
chase of. a police patrol boat for the
protection of water front property and
$400 to put new lamps on the Market

A conscientious, hard-working and
eminently successful clergyman writes:
"I am glad to bear testimony to the
* pleasure and increased measure of effi-
ciency and health that have come to me
from adopting Grape-Nuts food as one
of my articles of diet. '
"For several years I waa much dis-
tressed during the early part of each
day by indigestion. ~ My breakfast, usu-
ally consisting , of oatmeal, milk and
eggs, seemed to turn sour and failed to
digest. After dinner the headache and
other symptoms following the break -
Â° fast , would wear away, only to return,
however, next morning.
"Having heard "of Grape-Nuts food. I
finally concluded to -give it a fair trial.
I quit the. use of oatmeal and eggs and
made my breakfasts of. Grape-Nuts,
cream, toast .and Postum. The result
was surprising in improved : health and
.total absence of the distress that had,
for bo long, a time, followed the morn-
-ing meal. Mly digestion became once
more satisfactory, the headaches ceased
and the " old feeling 'of energy re-
turned. Since that time, four?" years
ego, I have always had. Grape-Nuts
food on ray breakfast table.
"I- was u delighted; to , find also, that
whereas before I began to use Grape^
Nuts food I was cuite nervous and be-
came easily \u25a0/. wearied in. the . work' of
preparing^- sermons and in study, .^a
marked improvement in this respect
resulted from the change in ; my; diet.
I am convinced/ that- Grape-Nuts: food
produced this result and helped me to
a 6turdy. condition of mental and-phyf
Elcal strength.
"I have known of several persons
\u25a0who were formerly troubled^asT* was
and who have been helped^as?l' have
been by the use of .food, on
my recommendation, among, whom; may
be mentioned the Rev.â â -r-. now., a
missionary to China." ; Name given 1 by

WOMA7T REPORTS PECULIAR
BURGLARY AT HER HOUSE
The Spring: Valley Water Company
resumed the testimony of their expert
accountant, George W. Reynolds, yes
terday. Reynolds recited all the pro
ceedings relative to the bond Issues up
to the general mortgage which was Is
sued by the Spring Valley Water Com
pany. The prior bond issues having
been made. by the Spring Valley Water
works. Reynolds showed that the sales
of all bonds and the proceeds there
from were devoted to the interests of
the company. .
Reynold* Again Give* Testlniony.
The Finance Committee denied the
claim of J. C. Coulston of Philadelphia
who holds a warrant for $75 in favor
of I. R. Riddell. drawn in 1855 against
the city, on ground that there are no
funds to pay it. An inquiry will be
made to ascertain If the. demand was
not paid in the year named.
Commissioner of Works Aigeltinger
informed the Finance Committee that
City Electrician Hewitt had refused to
furnish the specifications for the work
of placing an underground conduit on
Mission street Hewitt notified the
board that It will cost $1634 35 to put
the city's wires underground on' Mls
eJon street between Second and Fifth
but decline* to give any further infor
mation The committee directed Hew
itt to file a blue print of the work
required and also the work already
done In that connection.
The Finance Committee discussed the
advisability of amending the ordinance
relative to the installation of poles
on the public streets, so as to place
the supervision thereof entirely with
the Board of Works. The ordinance at
present also gives the Department of
Electricity control in the matter/ thus
causing a -conflict of authority between
the two departments. It is proposed
to pass two ordinances, one giving the
Board of Works power over the erec
tion of poles and the other placing the
control over the installation of electri
cal works thereon in the Department of
Electricity. The matter was referred
to the Joint committee on Judiciary and
Electricity, which meets Thursday aft
ernoon.
The board adopted a resolution re
questing the Assessor to transmit on
or before the first day of July a veri
fied report, separate from the. assess
ment roll, containing a complete list
of all persons who refused or neglected
to furnish a statement of their prop
erty.
The amended ordinance providing
that when a brick building does not
exceed two stories in height and is
used for warehouse purposes only, the
distance between brick partition walls
shall not exceed 137:6 feet was passed
to print.
The City Attorney was requested for
,sn opinion as to whether Ocean ave
nue, between Onondaga avenue and
Mission street, is the property of the
city, it being delineated on the official
map as an open public street but, as
a matter of fact. Is occupied by vege
table gardens and used for private pur
poses. The property owners hare in
augurated a movement to make a fine
driveway of the avenue.
The roadways' of Church street be
tween Duncan and Twenty-eighth.
Fourth avenue, between Hugo and I.
and Central avenue, between Oak and
Page, were accepted.
The City Street Improvement Com
pany was granted an extension of six
ty days from August 8, 1905, within
which to complete the paving of H
street between Seventh and Twentieth
avenues. "â¢ r
The board passed to print an ordi
nance setting apart forty feet, more
or les, of the House of Refuge lot, be
tween San Jose avenue and the west
erly boundary* of the lot, -as a public
street for the purpose of widening
Ocean avenue to a uniform width of
100 feet
Constructions of sewers and side
walks in Buena Vista and Holly Park
avenues; improving streets and side
walks around Alamo square; oil plant
In City Hall and Hall of Justice; pur
chase of burial ground in San Mateo
County for- the indigent dead; comple
tion of smallpox hospital and expenses
for defending suit brought by the
Springy Valley Company regarding
water fates.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution providing that the
unused amounts standing on June 30,
1905, to the credit of appropriations
made In the last budget for various
publio Improvements be carried for
ward and reappropriated for the fiscal
year 1805-1906 for the same purposes.
This action Insures the carrying out of
the Improvements, as under the char
. ter all unexpended balances of one year
muet be reapportioned in order " that
they may be used in the next fiscal
year. The Improvements affected are
as follows:
Widening and repaying of Fourth
street, from Market to Berry, at a cost
of $50,000.
Twin Peaks auxiliary water supply
system.
Acquirement of lands for St Mary's
square.
Paving of Mission street, from Onon
daga avenue to the county line.
Paving of H street, from Seventh*
avenue westward. ,
Opening up of Fulton street to the
Great Highway. "
Parking of Dolores street, from Fif
teenth to Seventeenth.
One of the most important transfers of
property that has" taken place in a great
number of years in San Francisco is now
being accomplished by; the firm of A: J.
Rich & Co., for the Frank Estate Com
pany of this city and the Von^Rhein
Estate Company for the purchaser. The
price runs up in the hundreds of;thou
sands and marks the Bale of that por
tion of land which may be styled the
starting point of the city of San Fran
cisco at Market and East streets. ' % L
This land has been covered with small
primitive buildings dating from the early
days of 1850 when the section was a long
wharf, charging toll for teams; to and
from the ferry that landed at this wharf.
The property at one time was owned
by""~lhe late Michael Reese, and about
forty years' ago sold by him to S." H.
Frank. It has been paying a revenue of
about $25,000 per year.
The purchaser is the Henry Cowell
Land and Cement Company. There- is
some gossip that the purchase was made
for the entrance way for one of the many
railroad lines that are fast looking .to
get some of the great trade to the Orient,
and 'establish its offices there. In other
quarters. this is disputed.
The Frank estate contemplated building
on the land this* fall. Complete -plans
and elevations are in their hands. They
were prepared by Albert M. Pissis, the
architect, in an elaborate manner. Per
haps "\he purchasing corporation will uti
lize said plans. They would beautify the
entrance to San Francisco much to the
satisfaction of the association for \u25a0 the
adornment of San Francisco.
The land 1 has a frontage on East street
and Market of the full blocks between
Sacramento, â¢ Commercial and Clay
streets, with an irregular, depth westerly
of from 100 to 200 feet
The general belief is that the transac
tion reperesents close to $500,000.

APVERTISE3rEXTS.
Nerve Exhaustion
In Nervous Breakdown, No Matter
What May Have Caused the
Trouble, Electro-Chemistry Is
Directly Curative. In All Nerv-
ous Affections Electro-Chemistry
is Curative Because of Its Direct
Strengthening Effect Upon the
Whole Nervous System.
The giving away of the nervous sys-
tem Is serious. In men the . nervous
breakdown unfits them for everything.
Business suffers and there is no capac-
ity for 'natural relaxation and enjoy- :
ment. In women the effects are even \u25a0
worse. The nervous organization of
women Is more delicate than that- ot
men, and when the nervous degenera-
tion begins, the woman naturally suf-
fers more. Under the building-up Influ-
ence of Electro-Chemistry the tired,
over-wrought and weakened ' nerves
rapidly regain strength. The sleep be-
comes refreshing. The little worries of
life soon disappear and. the big ones be-
come less burdensome, .with strong and
normal nerves to encounter their shock.
Medical .treatments are ' woefully weak
In nervous affections. In fact, In the
majority of cases they ': are absolutely
worthless. Bromides and chloral quiet
the nerves, but they do not cure. Their
continued use not only does not cure,
but they have a harmful and weakening
effect which usually ends in destroying
the nervous system entirely. , : In the
large Electro-Chemic practice here ;in
San Francisco a large percentage of the
cases are those presenting different
phases of nervous degeneration and dis-
ease. It-Is truly wonderful to see what
this wonderful new; treatment 'ls; ac-
complishing in cases 'which are abso-
lutely incurable, under- medical "treat-
ment. . One . lady, who ; was \so bad ; that
she was afraid to cross the street alone,
after one month's: treatment is so well
that she is making arrangements to go
to the. Fair in. Portland alone. One man
who was 'so bad- that he, contemplated
selling a profitable business because he
thought he could , not run It was so
muchbenefited'by a short course', of
Electrochemistry .'...that--' he ''now..:-, feels
that he is not only capable of. running
the business, ; but he- will soon put>ln
additional capital and increase^ it.' ' A
young man engaged to be married was
on t the verge of breaking the; engage-
ment and: thus probably spoiling the
happiness of two lives. From . ? long
hoursland hard work at - bookkeeping
his nervous system f gave way,, but
Electro-Chemistry cured him and he is
now.happily.-wed.- -.-, , ; ; .
Marvelous curative results are also
achieved: by Electro-Chemistry, iri^con-

"America for Americans" was the
slogan adopted by the Exclusion League
last night.
"A ; campaign of education which will
In time present sucÃ a clear case to the
voters of the United States and to their
representatives in Congress that there
can be but one resultâ a well defined and
permanent Oriental exclusion law among
our Federal statutes," was the announce
ment made in great earnestness and with
much demonstration of approval. 1 -
Three hundred 1 delegates gathered at
the meeting of , the Japanese and Korean
Exclusion League held in Pioneer Hall.
A large number of delegates had come m
from interior counties and towns. Santa
Clara;* Alameda, Napaand Sofwjna, coun
ties all : promised , .\u25a0\u25a0 to * lend'- \u25a0< moral and
financial support to the movement started
in San Francisco. . , \u25a0
In his opening address " Chairman O. A.
Tveitmoe dwelt on the utter incapability
of the yellow race to assimilate with the
people of the United States. Ex-Con
gressman E. J. Llvernash told of the
history of the Japanese and of their
necessity lor colonization in the future
owing to over-population at home. Con
gressman-elect E. A. Hayes promised his
support along any line of work at
tempted.
A resolution was passed asking the im
migration officers to give a committee all

CLAIM "AMERICA
FOR AMERICANS"
His wife fears that he may commit
suicide. Sheets' mother in Minnesota la
very, wealthy and if she makes good hi*
shortage the case may be dropped.
A warrant was issued for the arrest of
Sheets to-day on a charge of felony em
bezzlement, at the. instance of the Surety
Company. The company has announced
that' it will make good the shortage
whatever it may be. provided it does not
exceed 520.000.
In his letter of confession to his wife.
Sheets requested that a personal be In-
Berted by her in the Los Angeles Times
Informing him . how matters . stood and
telling her he would watch the papers.
To-morrow the broken-hearted wife will
have published thl3 message:
"Send one word of comfort. Live and
pray. I am faithful until death."
, LOS ANGELES. June 2G.â L. C. Sheets,
the missing assistant cashier of the
freight department of the Santa Fe Rail
road who fled from this city a week ago
because of the fear - that a shortage ot

San Francisco. 'A day or two after ho
left a telegram from that city, signed
J. J. Martin, was received at. his home
directing him to call up Martin at a
certain telephone, number- His heart
broken wife tried to call the number, but
could find no person named Martin there.
It is now believed had she tried long dis
tance and asked for that number in San.

Srrr York Stock lA*t.
NEW YORK. JunÂ» 26. â The course of to
day's stock market m-as watched with peculiar
interest to obtain light on now far last week'e
prote^sionally conducted advance \u25a0would prove
successful In awakening Interest in the market.
The result was encouraging to the hopes of
trto?e who bad embarked in the campaign in
the confidence that an agrgtessive leadership In
burin? stocks would attract a following. The
Â«>arly dealings on Monday morning are likely
to reflect the conclusions summed up from the
events cf the wÂ«^>k before on the p*rt of those
\u25a0who have watched from flay to day without
making a definite determination. On the other
hand it is often the case tnat the professional
operators vha have accumulated stocks only
â¢Â»alt for the Monday morning demand thus at
trscled to unload and secure the benefit of the
advance. The activity in tne first hour to-day
Ti-as accepted as evidence of a considerable ex
tension of interest in the market, and buying
orders were reported in considerable volume
from widely extended regions of the country.
There was not lacking tbe customary nMltng to
take advantage of this dwtinnd for the realiz
ing of prices. But the effect on the course or
prices was not marked and the uplift continued
quit* 1 steadily. One or two of the day's Inci
dents \u25a0were calculated rather to dash specula
tive or-.thuEiaejn, but thÂ« effect of these Â«Im>
\u25a0R-as ro<->4Â»rate. It was whispered prices were
advancing *" *s to fix the limits fixed by eÂ«ll
frr to that the transaction were active. When
the buying came to a pause no disposition wan
shown by sellers to follow prices downward
and pric*s held very steadily in the periods of
â¢JulineK.: Price* in London followed our mar
ket Â«nd did not at any time overtake It. so
that there was a profit in the selling here of
Ftotfc* trhich were, bought on arbltago in Lon
don" pv>r*isn markets were still disturbed ov*r
the friction between Germany and France.
Ths;Paris market recovered quite briskly and
private advice* received here from banking
sources in Berlin deprecated the fears felt ovÂ«r
the otiteeme Of the \u25a0 negotiations. A. keen de
mand for gold for Parts account develop*'!,
\u25a0however, resulting In all tne supply on the
tendon market being taken for Paris, while
encasÂ»ments reaching J3,3n0.G00 for shipment
to Paris this week were, maae here. It was
co-el-Wed probable that the movement might
rrxrh considerable proportions. This develop
ment had a disquieting effect on the market
ana there was a marked decline !n the rate of
aflvity sf'er the gold engagements were an
nounced. Ther* Is no doubt that the confix
<sence felt <n the continued great ease of the
rocney market has been an Important lnfinence
in nromoting the present speculative movement.
HooÂ» o* increased dividend disbursement* was
a'so a prominent feature of the day's opera
tion*. With the Readingdividend Increase as prÂ«
rodent it was argued that tbe policy thus Indi
cated would probably be pursued In the case of
Eainroore and Ohio and Norfolk and Western,
and' Union Pacific Â«v also made a feature on
Its good assurance of dividend Increase,
o One argument ustd to enforce the probability
of the dividend Increases was that <hry were
lii<2!ratÂ£-d by the high !evej on which these
rtocka were already filing. Any Incongruity
in pushing these etocks to a higher level did
net seem'to appear to the partisans Â«f this ar
gument. ' Railroad traffic official* made encour-
H-inr reports, and It wu pointed out that
June earnings thiÂ« >-oar win compare with the
\u0084"rtM of flood damag-j Urt year. The \u25a0 god
irTcagaments left the money market entirely
undiAurbcd. and. althoujrh the closing tone
ofth- market was slightly Irregular, prices

Bends were strong. Total- eales. p*r value,

Late raall advices fexim New York say: "The
iironger feeling in peaches noted at the end of
fast week seems to have extended to other
\u2666Ines. Private wires from the coast yesterday
Mated that a general advance In all grades of
cried, fruits is expected early this week. The
reason assigned is that buying has been extra
ordinarily heavy, but If that Is the case It
Â«wauld appear to have been done by other mar
kets than this, buyers here havlcg shown at
no time since the eeason opened any pro
pounced Interest in futures. Of apricots it Is
HtUmated that fully a quarter of the crop has
been sold already. One letter states that the
ra.es majÂ«Â« aggregate 350 cars, of which two-
JMrds were taken for export. The prune sit
uation on the coast is represented to be very
frtrong. According to some reports seven
tighths or more of the coming Santa Clara
prop is held on a3c f. o. b. basis. There are
fcUll . Borne sellers of Santa Clara on a 2%c
x. o. b. four size bag basis and of outside
brunes on a 2%0 f. o. b. basis. The demand
from this Quarter Is not at all urgent and the
export movement is eald to be slow, though
tare heard of ten cars new crop Santa. Clara

hortnern prunes on tte coast a sale of 100
tens 60s. to 80s on a l*Â£Â« f. o. b. basis Is re
torted, la the epot market 40s are very firm.

"take^effect -August ;1. ,.: Mr. Hollar, says
his 'action iiis ; T due solely to V his recent
bereavement.'v his Iwtfe having passed
away ltwo' months ago.'
; Indians -had retorted when asked
about; being brought over to. the state
of ;',the". white man that among the In
dians there 'was no killing- as. among',
the; whites, there was no robbery, no
'. burglary, and why change? they in
qulred.The, Indians, continued Commis
sipner Leupp, had been over-Instructed.
They had been pumped full .of ideas
the,y could not; digest.' He considered
that'toUeach.the boy to plow, .to har r "
row; and sow \u25a0\u25a0 resulted in . vastly \u25a0 more
g"ood than -, to teach him to' count the
constellations.;*;; .
'Â». Indian Commissioner Leupp delivered
an aduress before the Prebyterlan Min
isters'.-; Union. at .920. Sacramento Street
.yesterday morning. In which he gave
hi3;!d,eas as -to how the Indian should
â¢be, educated, not alone in the English
language.but in manual training. The
.commissioner urged that endeavor be
niade to bring up the Indian to know
how to till the soil, to educate him,' to
; teach, him' bookkeeping, stenography
arid. other accomplishments useful in. a
business career,- to teach him the art of
manufacturing,, building and all that
"manual' training stands â¢, for. ,- ; 5 ,,.,.
"The American Indian, said the com
missioner,- is like the heroes of Homer.
*He makes an' enthusiastic, stanch, emo
tional friend, true, as steel, but on. the
contrary,, make him an enemy 'and his
desire "to gain revenge for a\,wrong
done him goes to the other, extreme.
He believes in an eye for, an eye and a
toctth for a tooth. He will die for his
ifriend, : but"woe to those whose honesty,
of purpose he has cause to doubt.
\u0084 The^ grafting which,' had once been
practiced in : Indian:affairs came in^fbr

Edwin Emerson delivered a lecture
last night at Lyric Hall under the aus
pices of the Japanese Association of
America before fan . audience mostly
composed of Japanese. His subject was
the Russian- Japanese war. - Mr. Emer
son recently arrived from the Far East,
where he witnessed some of . the Im
portant battles during the war, and
was, therefore thoroughly familiar
with his subject.
Lectures on the War.
The verdict of \u25a0thÂ«.'jur'y in' face of the
fact that the instructions " of trie court
were to acquit in case fraud; as alleged
in the indictment,' was not shown, was
sufficient to demolish, the claim that there
had. only been negligence on the part of
Rebstock, the court said.- ' -
recourse . from, sentericing to -the: peni
tentiary.
Attorney O'Grady presented a i#etitlon
from eleven of .the jurors who had tried
Rebstock.; asking; that the defendant be,
"not sentenced to State . prison." The
name of William .Geist was the ,only one'
of - the. twelve that did .not appear 6n the!
petition and O'Grady said Geist would,
have signed it, but he lived in. Alameda;
County and could not .be found. \
O'Grady stated to the. court that James
C. Nealon, a member of the former Grand
Jury that indicted .Rebstock, had added
his name to .the petition signed by twelve
of his.collegues to- have r him" sentenced to
the County Jail. O'Grady ; said ,he be
l/eyed that there was only one 'meiriber
of that Grand '\u25a0 Jury, Wakefleld Baker,
who did. not , wish that the County Jail
sentence might be imposed.. ".
O'Grady said that this was -Rebstock's
first offense against the laws of the State
and. that since an 'early age he, had sup
ported his mother and five.' sisters. The
attorney, said he believed the crime had
been a, technical orie'and: that the de
fendant- had not willfully violated -the
\u25a0law. ' â¢â¢-.--. . - ..-, \u0084. :.:\u25a0 .: ..; . _,
\u25a0 The- court said that section 41 of . the
Pe'naT Code, under which Rebstock, ha<j
been prosecuted, spoke of "willfully or
neglige'ntly'V and "knowingly or fraudu
lently" violating the law. The penalty
provided was a fine _ not to exceed $1000 or
Imprisonment .-not t : to .exceed- five years,
or both.' The limit of' sentence to':the
County Jail is ; one I year. . and trie court
said that had it reasonable ground to be
lieve' ih"af. Rebstock had only "willfully
or' negligently" violated the election law,
as in the case of a man: who might, fall
to deliver the ballots at a booth'without
intent of â¢ committing a crime, he might
impose a fine and send the defendant 'to
the County Jail; but the testimony had
shown; that Rebstock â¢ had "knowingly
and fraudulently" violated, the law and he
must be given a greater punishment- than
was possible in a County Jail c commit
ment.

from 1173 cents Â«to -14 cents, which in-!
creases the- fund named by $13,700. and
if the roll goes to $520,000,000 will net the
schools an additional $14,000, which will
offset any possible reduction in the

William Armstrong and George Gra
ham,' members of .the Police Department,
and Policeman Flannagan, at. that time
Deputy I Coroner, testified that ,'they went
to the house of Mrs. Adams On the night
of the day. the child met its death and
found acid burns .on the floor of the
closet in the yard, into which Mrs. Adams
told them she - had taken the little one
just- before it is alleged to have, drunk
of -the acid, which was contained In a
whisky flask. The child's face was burned
on . each ' side from . mouth to : ear and
there ' were acid stains ,on the closet
floor, these witnesses said.
* -From* the cross-examination of Judge
Dibble it looks as if the defense would
advance the theory that the. burns were
caused -.by Mrs. Riley .wiping the froth
from the child's mouth. Tlie prosecution
contends that the marks from mouth. to
ear showed that the little one's head had
been -forced back when the acid ; en
tered it.Â«i;mouth.
* ,The- prosecution 'is" said to . have wit
nesses, connecting Mrs. â¢ Adams with the
purchase of carbolic acid.

Mrs.~L.ena Rlley while the latter told
In ''Judge Lawlor's court yesterday all
about the death of the child Mrs. Adams
is â¢ supposed to have poisoned with car
bolic'add, but she showed no emotion as
the details of how the little one frothed at
the .mouth arid its life finally fluttered out
were narrated ,by the witness. The tale"
of ; the cruel death of the child, barely
more than two years of age, was of a
nature, to- make men choke, but the
mother,- who .Is accused of having mur
dered : '. that - little one six years, ago,
seemed only interested in. how much Mrs.
Riley;would;jell.-. .
. The memory of the witness had failed
her : greatly during the " six years that
have passed since,; as Miss Kenny, she
went to Mrs.* Adams' home at 117 Park
avenue in answer to a summons from the
latter's brother and there found the baby
dying. She had to | read from the tran
script to refresh her memory and even
then could- not be possltive of many
things. ; S^he* remembered that she wiped
the frothr from ' the little fellow's mouth
and i saw some burns on his face. Mrs.
Adams told . her at the time that the
child had drunk something from a bottle
and I the witness smelled carbolic add.

previously been cross-examined by Judge

The immense fortune left by Hyppollte
Dutard will be , distributed as be wished,
such being the decision of the Supreme
'\ Court yesterday. Those relatives who In
stituted a. fight to effect a division more
advantageous to .themselves have no
cause of action., sasisbc of the seven
Justices, and the remaining Jurist did not
participate. Eiiza Dutard, the widow,
gets practically the whole of the gT&a*
property.:
Hyppollte Dutard's father left a com
mission business worth $15,000 at his death
in 1563. By the unanimous consent of
members of the family; Hyppollte as
sumed control of the estate on the under
standing that all were to have, their pro
portions of the -proceeds. There was
never any division of profits; although
Dutard supported his mother, until her
death.
In ten years the young man had turned
$15,000 into $100,000. . At the time of his i
death, in April, 1900. the fortune he was 1
rolling up the hill of business had a^ |
talned the size of $2,wv>*,ooo. Xearly all of .
the property, which consisted of stocks,
bonds boats, houses and land," was to-be
given," according to the decedent's wishes,
to his life's partner. -
Thekla Dutard Klelnclaua . and Leonca
Dutard. Hyppolite's brother and sister,
claimed > that they were entitled . to one
flfth each of the $2,500,000. as they -had
been entitled to the one-flfth each of the,
$15,000 estate left by their father^ During
the intervening thirty-flve years they had
never mentioned the matter of partner
ship .to their brother, and he had appar
ently forgotten it. Tbe lower court held
that the failure of contestants. to present
their claims during the lifetime of Hyp
pollte Dutard constituted laches and the
Supreme Court sustains that view.
- The court also decided yesteruay in op
position to the brother's and sister's
stand against a partial distribution of the
estate. -The property Involved in the lat
ter proceeding is situated tn Santa Clara
County and is appraised at $163,881.

"and a watery. matter ooze from it ancf
the scabs would all fall off. ; It would
,be raw for a ; time,' then scab . over
again. Some one recommended Cuti-
cura, and -we i immediately', procured
a box of Cuticura Ointment, and a cake '
of Cuticura Soap. She was much bet-

and soap, and an application of the
â¢ Ointment. Before it was half gone wo
saw a marked change for the; better,
; and she was entirery cured, without a
