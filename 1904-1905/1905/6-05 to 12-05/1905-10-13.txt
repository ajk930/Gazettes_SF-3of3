EX-SENATOR E. J. EMMONS IS GUILTY OF BRIBERY
KERN COUNTY POLITICIAN IS BRANDED AS FELON BY JURY AT SACRAMENTO
Ex-Senator E. J. Emmons of Kern County is guilty of bribery. The jury before- whom -he was tried, after deliberating less than three hours, returned a verdict that will send him to join
HarryÃunkcrs behind prison walls. The scene in court when the verdict was rendered was a heart-rending one. The boodlerV faithful wife, who,- during thejorig trial bravely, sat by her husband's
side and cheered him by her presence, upon hearing the words that branded her husband a felon, fell upon her knees and hysterically sobbed out her protestations against the decree of justice.

Affecting Scene in
Judge Hart's
A Courtroom.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 12.â Crying out In
futile protest against an inexorable de
cree of justice, hysterical with the shock
cf her sudden bereavement and utterly
prostrated by the blow, Mrs. E. J. Em-
fcions flung herself upon her knees m
Judge Hart's courtroom this evening at
the instant a verdict of guilty was re
inrned hy the jury which has been for
five weeks e::jraÂ£ed In the trial of her hus
band on a charge of boodling. All the
eagerness and. suppressed excitement that
attended the consummation of the long
trial were forgotten in the sudden reali
ratlon of a wife's grief; all the stern
formality of the courtroom was swept
eway in a wave of pity that surged from
every heart, and when Emmons seem
iMgi*-,_uumindfu! of the decree just ren
d'Jtd *.gaJnst him,- srpnrng^'itr nis vlTe'e
aspistanre, every head was turned away;
the voice of Judgp Hart faltered, and the
prbceedings stopped.
Never has there been' tif more pitiable
end to a trial in the department where
*'j many criminals . have found how hard
is the way ' of the transgressor. - The
ehort period engpged in deliberation con
veyed to many of those In attendance a
belief that the jury would return a ver
dict of fruilty, but Emmons, his wife
and his attorneys were to all outward
appearances as confident as at any time
during the trial. Had there been any in
timation given of the result, it is prob
able that the friends of Mrs. Emmons
LWQuld have prevailed upon her. to remain
tff'.ty from The court room during the
laFt trying scene. Emmons himself bore
up bravely and paid not the slightest
cmward attention to the verdict or the
subsequent proceedings while the session
Â«ts In progress. He appeared much mere
concerned over the condition of Mrs. Em-
I3;ons t and while the responses from the
Jurymen were called for and made, his
Lack was turned to Judge Hart, the ;
clerk's desk, and the jury.
GOES TO WIFE'S AID.
Gently he raised the stricken woman
from the floor, but while her arms en
circled him her head drooped over his
arm as if she were half fainting. Vainly
lie tried to soothe and quiet l*r. Her
*Â«ob*. broken by inarticulate pleadings,
1 echoed through the still court room, un
til the mother caught sight of Edith, her
little daughter, whose face was turned
toward the back of a big chair at her
father's side, and whose tiny form was
fhaken by convulsive sobs. Again Mrs.
Emmons fell upon her knees, but this
t!m<? it was not in the abandonment of
despair. Tenderly she raised the golden
head and the agony in her voice was
repressed as she endeavored to dry the
little girl's tears."
Half of the spectators in the courtroom
by this time had tears in their eyes and
the 6ilence had become embarrassing.
The clerk finally completed the reading of
the names and Judge Hart asked Grove
L. Johnson if he wanted to set the day
ffÂ»t arguing the motion for a new trial,
iy agreement a week from next Sat
urday was selected and the spectators,
the officials and the jurymen hurriedly
left the court room, where Mra. Emmons
Eat, apparently unmindful ,of her sur
roundings, sobbing while Tier husband
and two of tbe women in attendance en
deavored to calm her.
It was haJf past 5 when tbe jury retired
this evening for deliberation, and two
hours and a half later the verdict of
guilty was rendered. In the meanwhile,
4.he jury had been served with dinner, so
tW' the time Jjlven to discussion of the
<ase was necessarily brief. Just what
transpired in the jury-room will probably
lemain a secret. Before they returned to
the courtroom they entered, as they an
nounced. into an agreement to convey to
no living person an account of the man
ner in which the guilt of Emmons was de
termined. When they left the courthouse
tMj evening, after being discharged from
tho~ custody of the Sheriff, who has had
charge of them for nearly five weeks
n.iist they hurried away in every direc
tion,' refusing absolutely to discuss any
feature of thÂ» case.
EXPECTED liOXG WAIT.
The only utterance that would give any
clew to the number of ballots taken was
elicited from one member of the jury,
who, afters telling of the agreement en
tered into, eaid:
"There is nothing wc^ can say. The
result speaks for itself."
The same remark was made by other
jurymen, showing that It had been agreed
upon, and about the courthouse It was
generally believed that the jury found
for conviction upon the first ballot and
tj*t this was not taken until after the
jt#3' had partaken of dinner, which was
eerved in the jury-room.
After dinner Judge Hart and District
Attorney Seymour settled down In the

( oi" the playgoers,*; arid put to flight 1 wo-.
! men and children In the mfdst of- the!
I performance. I'roLests and appeals Trom J
j the actors and the management were
fruitless.
The mob of intruders took possession
and only yelled In derision at thÂ« plight
of the stage people who were divided in
their efforts to uuell the disturbance and' l
quiet the audience, frightened, by th-a I
sudilcir and unexpected tumult. While
the throng from the university grounds
carried the night their own way, Geoigu
Crilchrist, the leading man.uf the com
pany, who was impersonating Bertie Ce
cil in "Under Two ' Flags" suddenly
leaped from the stage, swinging hlsTstago
sword, a part "of the costume of the
character. Gilchrist made for the crowd
of students, followed by Ueorge Clawson
and Charles Thorpe, fellow actors.
For a moment a general meleÂ« was at
hand. But before , the ' determined on
j slaught the students gave way a bit and
gathered into a gorner of the playhouse.
Meanwhile, Ralph Chick, manager of the
show place, having exhausted his ef
forts to restore quiet, sent an alarm for
the police. Chief Vollmer, routed out of
bed, responded with a posse of six men.
The police surrounded the theater, bolted
and barred the doors, holding the &X)
students inside prisoners. The disturbed
audience had been dismissed, such as: had
not escaped at the outset. Then Vollmer,
displacing the actors, took the center ot
the stage and addressed the now some
what subdued youths from the campus.
He declared they were all subject to ar
rest for a gross breach of the peace and
he laid down the law as firmly as his
abilities permitted. Coupled with his ad
dress was a strong warning.
Chick announced that -the damage was
done not only to his property by the
rowdyism of the invading _band. but to
his business. -He demanded immediate
! compensation for the losses, and was ur
gent that the ringleaders of the mob be
jailed. The students, not relishing the
prospect, held a quick consultation. A
hat was passed and nearly â¢ JlOO was
raised on^tho spot as recompense. Those
in the mob also made themselves liable
to meet the balance of the* damage. Af
ter this settlement the police withdrew
their cordon and unbarred the doors, al
lowing the students to depart. The iden
tity of the men was learned' in some
cases, but until Manager Chick and the
police decide whether/further steps will
be taken, they will not- disclose who are
the culprits. The chief 'alarm among
many of the students who took part in
the affair was that the university officials
might take cognizance of it. .

What is clear to the police doit, In
View of KHiit* revined story of bis fight
with U illiiim and Hilda Brush, is that
Kills' reitiHtance foiled the plans of the
couple to murder him, cat him up, puck
nn:iv hi* remains, clear up the signs
of the tragedy and quietly slip away
with KlUn* money to parts where they
<-ould easily be hidden from all pur
\u25a0arnu
Now it is understood why the Brush
c< uple took up the carpet in the dining
room, rolled it up and placed it away,
VubjEtituting for the carpet two big sheet.*
of oil cloth, which lay loosely upon the
floor, ready to be taken up when the
bloody body of Eilis should be dropped
upon it. The bath tub was a few feet
aw;<y. the keen-edged carving knives and
ratrh<n wore under the pillows, right
at hand; the pcssors, rubber gloves,
acid and every implement necessary to
complete the work of butchery upon El
lis was prepared.
BRUSH NOT MUSCULAR.
What is regarded as most extraordinary
is that Kills should have been ablo to put
up f=o strenuous - light against two armed
persons who were determined to take his
life, and eventually to escape from their
clutches while in his head was a gap
ing holÂ» made by the big stool hammer
which William Brush wielded.
Ellis, it appears, is a man of great vi
tality, and unusual strength. Ills assail
ant, Brusn, is not a strong man. Brush
ls> more than e:x feet tall and yet he
weighs but 14tÂ» pounds. Tali, slender,
and with little muscular strength. Brush's
blow with the hammer did not affect the
victim as it would had a strong man de
livered it_ It partly Stunned Ellis, and
still he gave battle against both the
man and the woman who fought him,
knocking a pistol from the woman's hand,
and dealing Brush a sturdy blow on the

mer took down a report of his story just
as he told it. The statement made by
Ellis and given out by Vollmer to-night
is here given in full:
I tirst met Brush in the National Sporting
Cbd; ot Sydney. Australia, when he introduced
himself tc rae, and staled that he was a horse
owner In -\ratrica. iie spoke of the poseibili-
Ui_s of making' nioxwy in America, and being
sjxewhit depiivus ol ooming to this country
1 accepted m proposition from him to come to
America arid work tor hfrn aa trainer.
We ie:t Australia on the steanier Sierra,
stopped off at Honolulu and completed our
journey on the Sonoma, arriving here on Oc
lul*?r X. White in Australia Brush claimed to
be short of money, and borrowed from me on
several uoca6ions. 1 <io not know the exact
aiiioant. but believe it to be somewhere In the
neighborhood of J^\JOO.
The members oi the club seemed to have a
natural dlMtke for the man, for what reason I
cannot gay, and on several occasions warned
me. one ot them even going so far as to say
that he believed the fÂ«ilow to be v. thief.
Oa the boat coming over 1 Indulged in sev
eral gan-.tH with cards and invariably, lost to
him. He was accused by one of the men on
the boat of robbing him In one of the games,
and this put n:Â« somewhat on my guard. On
the night of our arrival we \u25a0 stopped at the
Occidental Hotel in San Krancisco. and the
following morning the three of ua came to
iWrke!ey. where Hrutsh and his wife secured a
lurnished house through a real estate dealer.
I was Induced to remain with them that
evening, but was a little bit suspicious of the
couple, so. that evening, before retiring. I put
tho bed against the doo.* and remained awake
all night. The next morning I engaged apart
ments at the Hotel Touraine in Oakland. I
root them several times alter this by appoint
ment, but was becoming more and more suspi
cious of them every day, since they seemed
anxious to avoid every one and did not care to
meet any of my friends, nor did. they seem
to have any friends here, although I was led
to believe from their talk that their friends
were numerous In this country.
FIGHTS WAY TO DOOR.
Tuesday I met them by appointment, and we
went to Golden Gate Park and the ChuteÃ.
He was then trying to induce me to go to
New York, with him. and said he was arrang
ing to leave the following day. We took in
the- numerous attractions at the Chutes, but
when I suggested the three of us being photo
graphed together he positively reiuaed and
taettully avoided the subject again. How
ever. fortunatÂ«iy .for me, as it may be the
means of appreiier.tjing 1 â¢ the people, I Induced
them to be weighed and measured on one of.
the numerous scales about the place.
On our way to the ferry they tried to get
me to go home with them, but being a little,
too persistent, and ' having a considerable
amount of money with me, I decide not- to go
with them. During the night I decided to go
to New York with th?m, and early in the
morning called at their place of reslcjence In
Berkeley, but did not find them at home. I
then returnf-d to Oakland and shipped my
trunks to San Francisco from the Fourteenth
street depot. \u25a0 After having lunch, I met
Brush, who was waiting for me outside
of the hotel. I then introduced him to the
lady of the house and accepted his invitation
to go to Berkeley.' Arriving there. 1 noticed
that Mrs Brush, or Milda, us she was called,
was .-onsiderably agitated. I mentioned the
fact, but she did not answer. I also noticed
that she wore no bodice! This also appeared
very strange to me, and I also mentioned that
v> them, but sines no explanation was offered
1 let the matter- drop. \u25a0
Being a trifle warm, I took my hat and coat
off ajad repaired to the dining-room, where,
after considerable coaxing on their part, I ac
cepted their invitation to partake of a light
luncheon. I had Just watcd myself and was
raising' a spoonful of marmalade to my mouth,
when 1- was struck from behind. I fell oft the
chair. I was not entirely unconscious and
got a glance of Brush standing behind me with
a hammer in one hand and a dagger In the
other. â¢
I attempted to rise, and as I did so he struck
mÂ» two more blows. He thÂ»n put his hands' ln
my hip pocket and took five one hundred dol
lar American bills that I. had with me. Thin
seemed to bring me to ray- senses, and I struck
him on the Jaw with my left hand...
I then rose and found the wojjian. standing
and pointing a revolver at me. .This 1
knocked from her hand- wl^h my right hand
and made Tor the door as fast, as I possibly
could in my dnzed condition. â¢--'â¢ â¢" i
JuÂ¥t as I arrived at the door he . made a
terrible lunge at me with the hammer again,
but fortunately missed me. I then ran as
hard as 1 could to get away from the place,
and r*m*mber falling into a stable.
Then all was blank to me until I awakened
on the operating table.
SBEN BY CONDUCTORS.
Marshal Voilmer of Berkeley, who is
tracing the fugitives from this end, has
learned that the uair took a Shattuek
avenue car from the corner of Bancroft
way and rode to the corner of Fortieth
street and Telegraph avenue. - They
reached Fortieth street at 3:15 o'clock
and waited for the Key Route train
which arrived at 3:34. The conductor
on the street car is positive in his iden
tification of the couple. He has been
interviewed by the detectives, but his
name has not been secured by the local
police. The conductor, on the Key
Route train is also positive that the.
man and the woman who rode on his
train are the criminals who made the
fiendish attack on Ellis. He says that
he noticed the couple coming from the
city on two other occasions and that
he could not be mistaken as to the peo
ple. Both the street-car man and the
Key Route conductor agree on the de
scription of the woman. They say she
wore a brown "auto" coat and brown
hat.
. Mrs. F. N. Moulton, who resides on
Hearst avenue, -in \u25a0 Berkeley, was
riding, to Oakland on a Telegraph
avenue car at about 3 minutes to
3 yesterday afternoon. She says
that a man and woman whose descrip
tion, answers that' of Brush and. his
companion boarded the car at the .cor
ner of Telegraph and Bancroft. The
woman seemed to be agitated and eyed
Mrs. Moulton suspiciously. The two
rode about 100 feet and then the wo
man- said, "Oh, we are on thÂ« wrong
car." - \u25a0 :
They signaled the conductor to stop,
and returned to Bancroft and walk
ed hurriedly down the street toward
Shatfjok avenue. This â¢ would have
given them just timÂ« to catcli the 3:15
car at Shattuok and Bancroft.
Thf: report that tho mysterious wom
an companion who was assisting Brush
in the horrible plot to munrder and rob
wafÂ» a member of tho famous Howard
gang of swindlers was called* to the at
tention of Chief \u25a0 Vollmer to-night, and
he promptly, discredited "*n.ny - such
theory. The 1 Howard gang, including
Mrs. Augustus Howard, wife of the
leader, operated In San Francisco about
seven years ago.
Never has a rrime so stirred, the peo
ple of Berkeley as the affair of yester
day. All this morning and till dark
crowds of curious people gathered
about the little cottage on Ellsworth
street., in the shadow of the Presbyte
rian Church, where the attack on Ellis
was made. i

trunks and suit cases left by the crimr
iuals'in their hasty flight after the mis
carrlaarc^of their plans have been taken
to the Marshal's office. These articles
were all inspected by detectives and
visitors at police headqarters to-day.
The Mothlng oi" both Brush and the
woman show taste and refinement Sllka
and satins ;\nd lingerie of the Orient
texture and SMlta oÂ£ costly material and
perfect tailorlnp fill the trunks and suit
cases. All these articles have been
thoroughly- searched, but no tell-tale
evidence or o!ew to the real identity of
the remarkable criminals has been
found. \u25a0
Ellis has identified himself as the
person who accompanied the Brushes to
S. B. Kenfleld's office when the Ells
worth-street cottage was rented. The
fact that he had been in such Iriendly
touch with the pair has given rise to
the theory that Ellis' relations with
the man and woman were closer than
he has admitted. Ellis has said Brush
told him he was a fugitive from Jus
tice; that he had been compelled to
flee from Chicago after shooting: a man.
The horseman knew of Brush's swin
dling at cards on the steamship, and
had other information that did not put
his new-found friends in a clean light.
ELLIS THE THIRD PARTY.
It is suspected that the" Brush pair
had in mind something more than the
robery of Kills" when they rented the
cottage. They might have been plan
ning to lure others to destruction, say
the police. In the effects of the pair
was found to-night a silver maple leaf,
one one side of which was inscribed,
"Always remember the true friends,
for they are indeed very scarce. Sam
Kronfeld, Auckland, N. Z., 22 Aug.,
1905."
â¢ Dr, McNulty, ship's surgeon of the
steamship Sonoma, on which the trio
arrived, related Incidents concerning
the ' Brushes to his mother. The doc
tor is iv San Francisco under treat
ment for blood poisoning. Mrs. Mc-
Nulty, his mother, who resides Â«t 1637
Oxford, street, Borkeley, said to-night:
"My'son spoke of these people when
he came home, because of the attention
they attracted on the steamship. They
had second-class passage. He told me
about Mrs. Curtis, as she was known,
being very pretty, but she did not stand
in very good repute during the voyage.
Her conduct was not becoming. My son
also stated how Brush was caught
cheating at a card game. One of the
passengers, who was standing behind
him, saw him hold some cards up his
sleeve and exposed the siwndler."
DOUBTS ROBBERY STORY.
"Bob" Larlos Says Ellin Never Had
Large Sum of 3loney.
"Bob" Larios, well known about
town, says he knew William Ellis
when he used to drop into the Cali
fornia Hotel bar. Larios said: "Ellis
used to drop! in frequently at the Cali
fornia bar. fie would occasionally say
that- he expected remittances from Au
stralia.'* At' other times he would say
he was going to train horses for Tom
Williams. He : was very fond of the
fair sex> an,d'.'was always watching the
pretty vrbjhen go by the hotel. I never
saw him display any large sums of
money. From his actions and what I
know of him I doubt very mucn the
robbery- story.".
William Brush and wife, wno are ac
cused by William Ellis of having at
tacked him in Berkeley, are registered
as having arrived at the Occidental
Hotel on October 2. They stayed there
one night. They brought a large
amount of baggage from Sydney and
Brush raised a great commotion in the
hotel because the express company was
slow in bringing it up from the steam
ship.
CUTS UP BODY
OF HIS VICTIM
NEW YORK, Oct. 12:â The finding of a
man's hea<l in East Eighteenth street,
near Avenue C, early to-day, resulted in
the discovery of an unusually revolting
murder, the victim of which was Thomas
Corcoran. Corcoran was killed probably
last night in the house at No. 149 Third
avenue. After the head was picked up
in the street the other portions of the
body were found cut to pieces in the
Third-avenue house.. The arms below. the
elbows and legs below the kne*s had been
packed in a suit case and the torso and
remaining portions of the armg and legs
were hidden in a' clothes hamper in a
room occupied by Frederick Bauer, an
elevator runner. Bauer was arrested.
The point at which the head was found
is more than a quarter of a mile away
from 149 Third avenue. The hÂ«ad was
wrapped in the Sunday supplement of
a German newspaper and a blue and
white shirt. ! -
The murder was discovered through a
story told by George Lanole, who had a
room adjoining. Bauer's, and who rushed
into the police station to-day saying that
he had lain awake for hours listening
to noises which .he thought proceeded
from Bauer's room. He said that late
last night he ncard.-at least two men
quarreling in the adjoining room. Ha
heard a shot and the sound of some one
falling on the floor. Then he went to
sleep. About 2:30 o'clock this morning
Lane j said he .was awakened by strange
no.ses in the room where the shot, had
been heard. Twice ''a man opened the
door and he went out. and Lanole, aicer
lying awatto listening for somet ime, de
cided â¢ that some of the -sounds he heard
wtre caused by bones being broken. 1 This
suspicion caused him to notify the police.
Bauer was found entering his room by
the police and said to them: "I found
my room like this when I awoke this
morning." ' . \u25a0"
He said that he had brought two men
to his room last night, one a soldier.
Bauer fell asleep while these' men talked,
he said, and when he awoke the soldier
was gone, leaving the other's body as, the
police found it. . . ,
The police found that Bauer's socks, the
right arm'of his_ undershirt, and the right
arm of an outer shirt were covered with
blood. A badly .nicked razor was found
on top of . a trunk in Bauer's room and
a revolver with one chamber empty was
also found in the rpom'.r. -%< â¢ .

jury. â¢ It was generally believed that the
deliberation would be prolonged, and some
of those interested in the result resigned
themselves to a vigil to be terminated,
as they thought, when Judge Hart would
order the. jury locked up for the. night.
At .ten minutes to S, however. Deputy
Sheriff Ben Chambers .came j from the
Jury-room and notified Judge Hart that
|.a verdict had been reached. There was
a brief interval allowed for the attorneys
â¢to be notified, and -meanwhile the news
had been flashed beyond the precincts of.
the courthouse. Judge Hart took hta
seat on the bench at three minutes to 8,.
and by that time the courtroom held
fully 100 people.
District Attorney Seymour, with Attor
neys Jones and Platnauer, were engaged
-in whispered conversation at one.jend of
the table., while Emmons, whose attor
neys had not yet arrived, listened smil
ingly to the prattle of his 10-year-old
daughter, who was seated at his., side.
Mrs. Emmons, with Mrs. Eli Wright,
occupied the seat just behind, her hus
band that she has occupied since the first
day of the trial.
On the stroke of 8 the jury .filed into
the courtroom and took their, seats in
the box. Emmons did not even turn
around as the door opened, nor did he
look in the direction. when the verdict was
rendered. Mrs. Emmons scanned the
faces of the first two or three, then turned
away. On the heels of the jurymen Grove
L. Johnson entered and took a seat by
Emmons' side. ' - :
VERDICT IS GUILTY. â¢
Clerk M. J. Sullivan called the names
of the twelve Jurymen and said, as he
has adid many times since the trial be-
San: :'-;j: '-;j
"All present) your Honor."'
Then Judge Hart, addressing the
Jury, asked: '\u25a0\u25a0
"Have you agreed upon a verdict,
gentlemen?"
"We have," replied . the jurymen in
chorus.
'â¢The foreman will read the verdict,"
directed the court.
And W. H. Sherburn, rising from his
seat, read:
The Slate of California vÂ». E. J. Em
niuni, Defendant! We, the jury ia the
above entitled action, find the defend
ant guilty urn charged.
Almost before the people in' the
courtroom had grasped the full signifi
cance of the result, a cry from Mrs.
Emmons had startled all present. The
wife of the convicted man flung her
self upon her knees upon the floor, her
head resting in the lap of Mrs. Wright.
An intense silence succeeded the inter
ruption and for a full minute there
was no sound save the hysterical cries
of Mrs. Emmons. Judge Hart, visibly
affected, was the first to recover. He
directed the clerk to poll the jury, and
after reading the verdict Clerk Sullivan
asked each member if he had agreed to
the verdict: Meanwhile, the sobs of
Mrs. Emmons and her fresh outburst of
grief at the sight of her child had af
fected every one in the courtroom,; and
the proceedings', 'after the date for ar
guing the motion for' a new trial had_
.been set, were speedily brought to an
end. '\u25a0;-.; ,â . ..; : -_'. â¢ j'j '
Half of the jurymen were crying asÂ£
they left the courtroom. District- At-*,
torney. Seymour' preceded "them up: the
stairway, and as 'h6- : passed them one
of the men who voted to find Emmons t
guilty said: ' '. '
"D â n such work. You'll never get
me on another Jury."
Judge Hart, himself on the verge of
tears, sought the privacy of his cham
bers and in a few moments the corridor
was emptied except for Mrs. Emmons,
two' other ladies and Attorney Irwin,
who accompanied the wife of the con
victed ex-Senator. \u25a0 " \u25a0 . . ,-.-,
Judge Hart had made 1 an ' order re
manding Emmons to the custody of the
Sheriff, and as he left the courtroom
Deputy Sheriff George Wittenbrock ac-'
companied him down the stairway that
leads to the jail. Mrs. Emmons fol-'
lowed through the street entrance and
in a moment the husband and j wife
were together in an inner apartment in
the Sheriff's bftice. Mrs. Emmons re
mained until some time afterward.
Emmons was locked up as soon as
she departed, it being evident that he
wished- to be left alone. -Jailer Tim'
Hagerty assigned Emmons to a cell in
the woman's department, adjoining
that in which Harry Bunkers, sen
tenced to five years for" complicity in
the same crime, has been incarcerated
for many weeks past.

. NEW YORK,' Oct. 12.â That five persons
nave, been cured of cancer in the Flower
Hospital. by the use- of radium coatings
on celluloid rods inserted into . the dis

read to-night by Dr. William H. Diffen
baoh,~ U'nued States delegate to the In

Hague, before the Homeopathic Medical
Society of the county of New York.
i In only one of six cases which he
treated. Dr. Diffenbach said, his effort
met with defeat. In that case the dis
ease was far advanced.
Dr. Diffenbach explained that for sev
eral years, in all experiments in the
Flower j Hospital, hermetically sealed
tubes containing radium' were used, but
it was found that in such form the
radium did not overcome the mechanical
obstacle. *
Through the experiments of Hugo
Lleber of>thiB city, he said, a solution
was finally' discovered or radium bromide
and gelatine, which, while havlng v Â«ll
the properties of pure radium, could "be
used to coat rods of celluloid or solid
rubber. ' ' With the coating of radium
bromide and gelatine on it, the rods were
inserted into slight incisions in the dis
eased part and allowed to remain there
for about two hours. After an interval
of two days the method was again fol
lowed and after several such treatments
the radium had the effect of destroying

BERLIN, Oct. 12.-rThere la much evi
dence to show that Germany's meat
famine is growing worse. Reports from
all parts of the country make mention
of the measures that are being taken to
abate the famine. At Rlsent. a confer
ence of the municipalities in the region
decided to establish regular rabbit mar

Since horse flesh' has risen in price and

has spread to various Westphalian cities.

that the price of meat in still rising.

Guilty Pair Are
Prominent in
Church.
OAKLAND, Oct. 12.â Henry A. Logan,
23 years of age,,- a trustee of the First
Free Baptist Church, has eloped with
Ethel Cook, sixteen years old, a student
in the Oakland. High School and a teacher
in the primary class of the church. Logan
has abandoned his' wife and their son,
â¬ight years old. because of his mad in
fatuation for the girl he persuaded to
h.rome his companion in flight.
Mrs. Mary Ross, mother of the missing
schoolgirl, ha? sworn to a warrant for
the arrest of Logan on a charge of kid
naping-. The warrant has been placed in
the hands of the police and Chief of
Police Hodgkins has sent telegraphed de
ecriptions of the runaways throughout
the State.
The pair have been missing since yes
terday morning. Logan left his resi
dence. 565 Twentieth street, ostensibly to
go to work at the Elaterite Roofing Com
pany. He bade good-by to. his wife and
boy and gave not the slightest indication
of his real purpose. Miss Cook started
about the same time, as customary, for
school. Her homo is at 1767 Grove street.
There wes not a sign to betray the plans
that the pair had formed. Shortly after
ward Logan was seen at Sixteenth street
station carrying a dress-suit case. He
boarded a northbound Oregon train. It is
believed by the police he met the girl on
that train. The eloping husband took
with him $SO, his month's salary, and left
his wife and son to shift for themselves.
Logan himself confirmed the suspicions
that had been aroused yesterday by the
abeence of the pair, for their conduct at
church had given rise to gossip. He sent
a letter to the girl's mother, which she
received last night, in which he declared

his love for her daughter and the love" in
return of the girl." He wrote that they
had gone away together and would seek
to find life congenial together far away
from Oakland. But he warned Mrs. Ross
to still her tongue concerning their flight
lest she should never see her child again.
Should the despairing mother maintain
silence, Logan magnanimously declared
he would see to" it that mother and child
might meet at some future time.
.MOTHER SEEKS ADVICE.
With this message the wretched mother
went at once to Professor S.- P. Meads,
a member of the church board, for coun
sel. They decided to place the case in
the hands- of the police after a visit to
Mrs. Logan had disclosed the unexplained
absence of the head of the family.
ihe deserted wife is prostrated under
the blow that has so suddenly wrecked
her happiness. To friends s.ie said there
was not the slightest suspicion of her
husband. He had been dutiful and at
tentive to his family, had appeared to be
devoutly wrapped up in his work at the
church, where he had been honored by
appointment to an important post. His
conduct on surface was without
stain or blemish.
But there was not the same confidence
in the Ross household. Mrs. Ross had
occasion some time ago to remark Logan's
attentions to her daughter. She spoke
to the girl, but Ethel's reply, "I do not
think anything of Mr. Logan, mamma;
he only helps me in my Sunday school
work," warded off further inquiry at
that time, although Mrs. Ross did speak
to Logan on the subject of undue atten
tions.' He satisfied her.
The Logans, the girl and her mother,
were regular attendants upon worship at
the First Free Baptist Church. In his
official capacity as trustee Logan over
iooked the Sunday school and thus be
came acquainted with this bright, young
school girl. She became strangely in
fatuated with this oily tongued over
seer. But her youth and cleverness were
no protection. The work was so in
sidiously prosecuted that the young
teacher was in the tolls of unrighteous
love before she realized what had oc
curred. Thus does the mother reason out
her absent daughter's plight.
Mrs. Ross tries* to believe her daugh
ter was an unwilling party to the elope
ment. She attempts to ease her mind to
some extent by declaring Logan must
have drugged the girl to Induce her to
flee with him. The mother said:
What sort of influence this man Logan ex
erclMd over ray daughter I cannot explain.
My great fear is he has druggred her and that
ehe will return to me a physical and mental
wreck. My child was reared with all the love
and attention a mother could give her off
spring.
ETHEL. A QUIET GIRL.
Ethel was a quiet home body. She was
deeply interested in her church work and,
deeplte her youth, was very successful as a
teacher in the ' Sunday school. At the high
echool she ranked among the best scholars.
She wa* highest 1 In her class and was par
ticularly proficient in her Latin and Greek.
So far ac Logan is concerned. It has been
known in church circles for some time that
he was giving too much attention to young
girl* In the congregation. His actions were
unseemly Jn a married man. especially of his
standing In the church. I went to him myself
and requested him to cease his obvious atten
tions to my daughter tinder penalty of inform
ing my husband it they did not cease. Logan
protested that he meant nothing wrong by
his actions, but he would 6top if they were
deemed offensive. There were several con
versations on the subject and I dropped it
at last. : V.
Ethel awl I were friendly with tho Logans
and vlHited at their home. I have the deepest
sympathy for Mrs. Logan, for Phe Is in no
way responsible for her husband's conduct.
As for my child, all I deeire Is that she shall
be brought back to me. I do not hold her
guilty. lor she vras too young to be responsible
In such a cruel occurrence as this. But Logan
is accountable, and If he is caught he shall be
punished and made to suffer as I and his WifÂ«
are suffering.
Mrs. Logan, it has been reported, re
ceived a message from her erring hus
band which revealed the elopement. She
has declined to confirm the report. Be
yond admitting tho absence of her hus
band, i the grieving wife has kept her
own counsel so far as public explanations
are concerned. - -\
When Ethel left home yesterday morn-
Ing she wore an ordinary school girl out
fitâa brown skir^ shoe top length, navy
blue checkered shirtwaist, brown coat,
red lining- with an eagle worked In red
eilk on left arm, brown hat with red rib
bon and black shoes.
The police received Information to
night that Logan and his companion
went to Portland, Or. .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY; OCTOBER 13, 1905.
CUBA ON VERCE
OF REVOLUTION
Only the Platt Amendment
Prevents Open War Be
tween Political Factions
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 12.â The political
situation here is ho intolerable that in
any Spanish-Amercian country but Cuba,
with its Platt amendment, a revolution
would appear certain. Word reached here
to-day of another political murder on the
island. This time the victim was Nor
berto Perez, a member of .the Moderate
party, at Consolacion del Sur. The. crime
is said to have resulted from alleged dis
crimination against Liberals In the recent
primary elections.
Senor PeVez was stabbed in the pres
ence of several persons, who made no
apparent effort to detain the murderer.
Local officials report that they are doing
all possible to locate the criminals, but
the feeling is strong here that there will
be no arrest. v-'V '
All persons familiar with present con
ditions agree that the general election
on December 1 will be marked by rioting
throughout the republic. The Moderates,
who are supporting President Palma for
re-election, insist that the Llheral lead
ers have openly boasted that they would
have bands of thugs at the polls to fight
the rural guards, who are charged with
the electorate work. The Liberals say
that the guards are posted in order to
Prevent freedom of the ballot. They think
It necessary to have a large enough force
to overawe the authorities and compel
the acceptance of the votes of citizens.
The differences between the parties
have settled down largely to sensational
personalities and the real issues are very
vague.
The Liberals continue to oppose the
Platt amendment, which they would like
to expunge from the constitution, and
they decry American Influence. Their
numerical strength Is considerable Tho
only Question i s whether or not they
could win with a fair count.
The first election of Senor Thomas
Estrada Palma Is admitted by his friends
to have been cut and dried in advance by
arrangement with the Americans.
Two companies of artillery which were
sent to Cienfuego.s after the election mur
der there are still kept in that town for
fear of further outbreaks and will Bnot8 not be
moved until after December 1.

INVENTOR LAKE
LOSES SECRET
Report of: the Theft of Plans
for His Submarine Tor
pedo-Boat Is Confirmed
EMPLOYE IS SUSPECTED
Detectives Search Every In
coming Liner at New York
in* Quest of the Culprit
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct.- 12.â That the latest
plans for the Lake submarine torpedo
boat have been stolen from the newly es
tablished works of Simon Lake in Ber
lin has just been confirmed here. The
plans are believed to be in the hands
of a former employe.
It is scarcely two weeks since the in
ventor left here to take up his permanent
abode in the German capital. He had
belore been at work in his Berlin office
and during a visit to this country ,the
theft is supposed to have. been committed.
Already one employe of the Lake Com
pany has been searched on his arrival
for valuable pavers and every ship that
arrives now from German ports is sub
ject to a scrutiny by detectives employed
by the company.
Surrounded by great seciecy, the fact
of the loss might still have_been kept
from the public had- it not been for the
taKerr.eps displayed by watchers who met
the Fuerst Bismarck of the Hamburg
American Line, after the ship had docked
tit Hoboken on Tuesday. Two men, who
paid to special treasury agents on the
pier -that they were employes of the
Lake Company, seemed elated that the
passenger list bore the name of a man
whom they evidently wexe seeking. When
this passenger, a prosperous looking
German, alighted with his wife, they at
once accosted him and asked him If he
haÂ«.i been in the employ of the Lake Com
pany in Berlin. At first the man denied
this, but afterward he admitted that he
nad been employed as a mechanical en
gineer. He resented any attempt to
search his baggage, but, when threatened
with arrest, consented. '\u25a0"\u25a0/:\u25a0-
Carefully, the baggage of the couple
was overhauled, but nothing was dis
closed except some sketch books con
taining drawings of sections of the old
type Lake boats.
Fester M. Voorhees, the former Gov
ernor of New Jersey, at his home In
Elizabeth, expressed surprise that the
loss of the plans had become known.
Voorhees is counsel for the Lake Com
pany. -..,:<
"1 am at present engaged In cabling to
the offices in Berlin," he said, "and It is
extremely ppssible that there will be
sume interesting information to -c made
public before to-mortcw night."
OIL TKUST GIVEN
SHOCK m KANSAS
President Is Told of the
Taming of the Standard
Company.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12.â Railroad
rate legislation and the oil situation,
with special reference to the "Middle
West field, were , discussed Tto-day by
the President and Representative
Campbell of Kansas. Campbell .talked
briefly of railroad rates and of the con
test between the State of Kansas and
the oil combination. He assured the
President that the people of Kansas
stood squarely at his back on the qiies
tion of railroad rate legislation "and
there was no doubt he would have the
unqualified support of the Kansas
congressional delegation.
The President expressed Interest in
the oil situation. Said Campbell:
The Middle West has the greatest oil field
in ihe worm. The prospects now are brighter
for the industry than ever before. Independent
refineries are springing up over, the field. Al
ready two are in operation and several others
will be at work within sixty days. The oil
combination never has had such a shock from
the people as It has received during the past
eight months. Heretofore it simply has over
run all competition or ignored it entirely. Now
It is obliged . to reckon with It.

The report also calls attention of the
association to the matter of tariff re

There is probably not a retail stationer here
who does not pay duties either directly to the
United States Government or Indirectly through
importers and Jobbers, and, in many cases, on
account of high duties and excessive profits,

A DISAVOWAL
Expects Great Britain to Ex
plain Away the Revelations
* in the Matin of Paris
TAKES A SEKIOUS VIEW
Delcasse's Belief That Lon
don Would Like War Be
lieved to Have Some Basis
COLOGNE. Oct. 12.â The Cologne Ga
zette to-day prints an inspired dispatch
from Berlin in which the Paris Matin's
revelations arc discussed. The
notes that the article In the Matin has
caused great erabarassment in Prance
and Great Britain. It is evident from the
dispatch that the German Government
assumed that M. Delcasse believed in
Brood faith that France had Great Brit
ain's promise of military assistance for
war with Germany aÂ»d shaped his policy
accordingly. Therefore. the dispatch
points out, it is impossible to brush the
Matin's story aside as chimerical.
If M. Delcasse was self-ckcelved, the
dispatch says, still the practical conse
quences' would have been the same and
war would have resulted from his pas
sionate policy of revenge. M. Delcasse's
belief that Great Britain's assistance was
pledged formed the basis of his policy
and the attempt made in Great Britain
to dismiss the matter as a ridiculous fan
tasm is insufficient and the story cannot
be disposed of in this way.
The German view, the dispatch adds, is
that the story must be taken seriously
until the British Government gives out a
formal utterance to fully vindicate the
position of Great Britain.

DISTRICT WORK WELL IN HAND
Louis Sloss Calls a Conference on
the Subject of Finance.
Ruefters, masquerading as independent
Eppublicans, and other Ruefters, calling
themselves independent Democrats, are
working to obtain signatures which may
give the Board of Election Commission
ers some color of Justification for placing
the name of Schmitz on the official ballot
In twe party columns in addition to the
Union Labor designation. If the com
missioners attempt to use the designa
tions "Republican" or "Democrat" for
any nominee for Mayor other than
John S. Partridge an immediate
appeal will be made to the courts
for a writ prohibiting puch use. Legal
representatives of the Fusion organiza
tion are ready to meet the issue in the
courts.
Rumor is rife to the effect that Ruef
has ordered the Election Commissioners
to select the precinct election officers re
gardless of the recommendation of the
Republican and Democratic political ..or
ganizations. The law provides repre
sentation for each of the prominent po
litical parties on a precinct board, but
Ruef is planning to beat the law by ap
pokating Ruefters and designating the ap
pointees as Republicans or Democrats.
The purpose of the juggle with the law
is 10 give the grafters absolute control of
every precinct election board in the town,
Bteps have been taken to court to com

Â«.g Ruef and Schmitz have not achieved
masttry of the judiciary. The people of
San Francisco, solemnly in earnest, have
the right and the law in their favor.
PAIITRIDGE SsTKE.VGTH GROWS.
John S. Partridge,' the Fusion nomin
nee for Mayor, is making an excellent
campaign. The young men of the city
are ltadlng an .active fight in support
of his candidacy. The influence ot
good women is tending largely in his
favor. Old line Democrats are heartily
in accord with the fusion movement.
The indications are now plain that the
l* t ooo Democrats who refused to vote
for Schmitz in 1901 and again refused
to vote for him in 1903 will vote for
Partridge in the coming election.
The coalition of Democrats and Re
publicans will largely increase the ma
jorities over Schmitz in the eight dis
tricts which Crocker won in 1903 and
at the same time largely diminish, if
not extinguish, the Schinitz majorities
in several of the remaining ten dis
tricts. The Thirtieth District is Ruef's
stronghold. In the election two years
ago Bchmitz's plurality was 1425. He
received 2152 votes against Crocker's
671 and Lane's 727. On November 7
the Partridge forces will cut down
Schmitz's majority in that district
to 600.
Ruef is working under cover and in
the dark to save Schmitz as far as
possible in the Forty-second District.
Two years ago Crocker won this dis
trict, receiving 1457 votes against 1363
for Schmitz. The Lane vote was 881.
In the election next month Partridge
\u25a0will probably hold the Lane and Crock
er vote and carry the district by 1000
majority.
In the Forty-fourth District George
Borne and a gang of Ruefters are
making a f-pecial fight in Schmitz's be
half.^ The district has been stuffed and
colonized to help the grafters, hence
the forces of fusion must be alert and
vigorous.
CHANCES VERY BRIGHT.
Two years ago Crocker carried the
Forty-fourth District, receiving 1360
ftgainst Schmitz's 1210 and Lane's 704.
The combined vote of Crocker and
Lane in the district was 2064. Part
ridge stands a fine chance of receiving
this combined vote and winning the
Forty-fourth District by a handsome
majority, although the Ruefters are
:laiminjr the district The Fusion cam
paign committee is fully apprised of
thft fact that Ruef Is counting on a
tremendous boost for Schmitz In the

ganlzation in that quarter of San Fran
cisco. Campaign oratory is good, but
it should be supplemented. by individu
al appeal to every registered voter who
has had enough of Ruef and Schmitz.
Every citizen who is ready to do battle for
the cause of common honesty in local
government should constitute^ himself
a committee of one to help the cam
paign committee.
A majority of 2000 for Partridge in
the Fortieth Assembly District would
not surprise the promoters of the Fu
sion movement. In 1903 Crocker re
ceived in this district 1646 votes. Lane
got 715 and Schmitz 658. There, are
many Indications that Partridge will
get more votes than were cast two
years ago for both Crocker and Lane.
The assurance of an immense majority,
however, should not cause any citizen
of the Fortieth District to relax his ef
forts in support of Partridge. If the
election should be very close an over
whelming majority in the Fortieth Dis
trict would determine the contest in
favor of the Fusion nominees.
George D. Clark, Fairfax H. Wheelan,
John T. Daly and Richard J. Welch of
the organization committee of the San
Francisco Republican League met at
Fusion headquarters, 636 Market street,
Wednesday evening and discussed cam
paign, affairs.
It is the judgment of the committee
that Mr. Partridge will be elected May
or by a handsome majority. The fight
for common honesty in municipal af
fairs will be conducted with vigor and
earnestness until the close of thfe day,
November 7.

TACOMA, Oct. 12.â One of -the most
interesting of. the many Klondike ro

ago when Edward Conrad was married
to Charlotte . Rlpstorff, who traveled ,7000
miles from Hamburg, Germany, to marry
a man she had never seen.
Her brother, Henry Rlpstorffr has been
Conrad's Intimate friend for three years.
From his sister Rlpstorff received letters
so full of tender messages and solicita
tions as to awaken the keenest interest
of Conrad, who heard them read by-Rlp
storff before their cabin fire. He asked
and received permission to write to her,
Phqtos' were exchanged and before long
they were engaged.
Belling his mining interests Conrad
opened a confectionery store in j Dawson
and continued to prosper. Last spring a
draft was sent to Hamburg, and Miss
Ripstorff started for Dawson, arriving
late In July. For several weeks she was
her brother's guest. In September she
was married to Conrad- by Rev. John
Pringle of the Presbyterian Church.
Miss Rlpstorff comes from a good Ger
man family and will be heir to an estate
in Hamburg when her parents die. Con
rad has been in the Klondike since cross
ing the Chilkoot trair.elght years ago.
Previously he lived In Alameda, where
he,hajs lately, purchased a new home for
his parents.

Wednesday evening, and last night he
addressed three crowds- with a new apr

distance between halls was so great that
he was unable -to appear, before them.
.As usual, he was greeted with cheers on
his entrance into every meeting i place,
and his words were listened to by good
sized crowds. .. -',
Last night the first campaign speech
was made at Mangels' Hall, ZTwenty

there and hear those outbursts of en

for the past four years In preserving the

There Is a persistent rumor here that the
robber was captured last night and

which in June last presented the pe

ELECTRIC ROAD
TO OBSERVATORY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 12.â An electric rail
way up Mount Hamilton to Lick Ob
servatory is an assured fact. The
i financiers of the project are W. S. Tevis
of San Francisco and the men associ
ated with him In the Bay Cities Water
Company. An agreement has been
reached between the Mount Hamilton
Exploitation Company, which for the
last year has betn making:, surveys for
the road, and the syndicate of capital
ists whereby the latter, after an ex
amination of the routes and a favor
able report upon the scheme, are to
build, eauip and -operate the road. For
several weeks the syndicate of capi
talists has had engineers in the field
checking up the work of the engineers
of the exploitation company.
Two routes have been surveyed for
the road, one by Grand View and Halls
Valley, the other by EvergTeen and
San Felipe Valley. The first route,
which was favored by the exploitation
company, has been rejected by the
financier* and the' road will be built by
Evergreen and San Felipe Valley, as
the Bay Cities Water Company owns
thousands of acres of land in that sec
tion. It is proposed to subdivide this
'large tract of land. f \
The promoters of the road propose to
make it^one of the greatest scenic and
pleasure" routes in the State. In 6rder
.that all their patrons may have a
glimpse of the skies and not interfere
with the work of Lick Observatory, a
large observatory, fitted with 1 strong
glasses, will be. builÂ£ on Mount Hamil
ton, or an adjoining peak, which will
be kept open' at all times.

WELL-KNOWN BUSINESS MAN
WHO DIBD AT HIS HOME. IN
THIS CITY.
VAINLY SEARCHES
CITY FOR HIS DOG
Bostoir Millionaire's Long
and Fruitless Automo
bile Rider
W. C. Sewall, a wealthy young resi
dent of Bo3ton, who has been a guest
at the St. Francis Hotel for several
days, has spent the last three days
scouring over the city in/an automo
bile with a detective, eagerly searching
for a valuable dog. Sewall recently
arrived from Sydney, - where he pur
chased an .Irish terrier, paying for the
brute $1000. Arriving here he had a
handsome silver mounted collar made
for his pet and then sallied forth with
the dog, -which. had seemingly taken
kindly to his new master and was ap
parently enjoying the climate of his
adopted country.
On Tuesday. : while the terrier was
quietly - trailing behind , his master
through the streets of the Western
Addition, something on one of thfe'eross
streets suddenly attracted 'his curiosity
and turning up the â¢ thoroughfare he
parted for good .with Sewall. A few
minutes later, when Sewall missed his
dog. he retraced^ '-his - -footsteps, but
could not nnd the terrier. He rushed
back to the St. Francis, summoned a
detective and with . the- latter, started
out on a hunt for. the missing dog. The
better part of Tuesday, and all of, We
dnesday were spent - in - the \u25a0 search and
then Bewail decided to. advertise fqr
the dog,, hoping". that; he would .be re-,
turned by some one who was anxious
for a vcward, .. "\u25a0 \u25a0, -> . .:: ,â¢\u25a0 ;..
But this scheme also, failed. \u25a0'\u25a0 For
several hou'rsj -yesterday Sewall â¢ ner
vously strutted about' the v onTee<of the
St.. Francis awaiting the. return of the
dog that never came. -Even .as- late as
8' o'clock in the evening- the. young
Boston millionaire held out some hope,
but still the dog did not come. . Finally
Sewall arranged with the management
of the house to continue the search for
the dog and repaired to his- apartments
to prepare for his departure for the
East to-day. It has been agreed that
if the terrior is found it shall be
shipped to Boston, but the porters of
the hotel are laying odds that the dog
will become a permanent fixture in
San Francisco. Sewall claims that his
dog has only two equals in this coun
try, a fact which he says was respon
sible for ills paying an exceptional high
prico for him in Sydney:

mits Murder and Suicide
BAKERSFIELD, Oct. 12.â This even
ing at,- the Jewett \ 'dairy ranch, four
miles west. of this city, Antona Cross, a
negro, formerly employed at the ranch,
shot and Instantly killed another negro
ranchhand, named A. L-ee. After
emptying his revolver on" his victim,
the -murderer calmly loaded his weapon
and put a' bullet through his brain.
, The motive for this, one of the" most
cold-blooded murders in the history of
the county, originated <ten days ago,
â¢when Cross, the murderer, . was dis
charged. by Manager Simmons of the
ranch. . For â¢. some days previous to
Cross' discharge the two negroes had
been /quarreling, and. as Cross ap->
peared to ibe the aggressor, and as he
had.beenilax in his duties, he was tolu
to go.' i> ' - \ ' Â» , .
: Nothing further was heard from him
until he appeared suddenly .at the
ranch this., afternoon. He loitered
around the premises and when Lee had
commenced his: evening milking in an
isolated -co wpen Cross walked ,v, up -to
him, and, without a word of warning,
emptied his revolver. It appears that
he wan. so nervous that only one bul
let took 'effect. This entered under
I,ee's right ear and death was Instan
taneous. Cross then refilled his
volver, pressed.it upward beneath the
right side of his jaw and fired. His
act was seen by another farmer.
BROWNING CULT
HAS AFTERNOON
OF INTENSITY
The long-haired, the cultured, the curi
ous, the matinee inveterate, crowded into
the Columbia yesterday afternoon to the
Browning "In a Balcony," then and
there given for the first time here by
Miss Eleanor Robson and her associates.
A brave attempt to get the audience Into
its seats by 3 o'clock met with failure.
Promptly as promised the lights w*nt
down at 3 and the musical moonlight in
the orchestra was turned on. But still
they came. It took the other lights and
ten good-minutes finally to seat the crowd
and a precious loss of atmosphere. It
was badly managed. An exceptionally
well-chosen' orchestral prelude, was given,
but unmercifully dragged out, and with
them a deadly, pause lengthening between
It and the rise of the curtain.
But the, curtain did rise at last, and
upon a, seine that the maddest Brown
ingite could not- but be satisfied with,
Italian, moonlight, .trees sleeping In the
distance, . a noble balcony, and a single,
slim, golden-gowned- figure ..in. the fore
ground.* :Miss .Robsqn's work is charming
throughout, bul^ possibly' its most telling
phase is.in the singularly beautiful picture
thatshe contrived always io present, -"with
her; eloquent .sensitive hands,, and grace
ful.", fragile figure... ; The true i romantic
note was immediately struck, and upon
Mr. I Warner's entrance lifted to brilliant
corivlc.lon. There iS one actress who
could better Mls"s Robson* s Browning, and
that is Julia Marlowe. Nay, there is an
other, and that other Margaret Anglln, of
whom Miss ' Robson hauntingly reminds
here. ;"
Better ' than Mr. Warner].? Norbert it
were quite impossible, to- imagine. Beau
tiful # hls voice is, not. but the ardent.in
telligence of his reading, the tenderness,
spirit and passion of ?Â»Ir. Warner's acting
leave nothing to be desired. Poet he is,
or the player \u25a0 could . not" so read this
poetry, and the physical illusion is abso
lute. Thbsein search of a Paolo, of a
Romeo, need not go farther and the mat
ine'e girl is doomed again.
Miss Dwyer's queen is another story,
strongly ' intelligent as. 'it is.." She is not
in the picture. The "divinity that . doth
hedge a king" is lacking, nor do Miss
Dwyer's sonsie proportions at all suggest
the frail, ; love-hungry, passion-worn
creature who believes she has at last
found love. It is not at all a matter ot
not understanding with Miss Dwyer,
simply a matter of atmosphere.
With these three people there was given
the little Browning play, with such
keen and constant enjoyment to the
audience that the \u25a0 poetic play, will
forever -look better. 'to ' one .theatrical
manager? Given without " intermission,
it had . â¢ the % perfect -* illusion ;of the
short story. It has .long speeches,
but : the psychological interest of these
is almost Ibsenic in its, intensity. Three
people, only, on a moonlit balcony, hardly
any action, -yet is here. drama of the sub
tlest and most: compelling. â¢
.Possibly/it is in suggestion of the subtle
sophistication" of .Constance, the intrigu
ante by nature and instinct, that Miss
Robson is .most successful. A little ar
tificial one finds her in the'delivery of her
lines at the; beginning' of \ the play, later
to come Into- a fine naturalness. Not
so deeply poetic" as. one perhaps expected
is the- portrait, its single/ ecstasy of no
bility not-fuli-toned. enough.'. but. in deli
cady. tenderness,', beauty of picture, one
could ask -no more. And most-exquisite
ly-,' eloquently, Miss Robson does nothing.
By : all' means 'should the play.-be- re
.peated. ' : , â¢ \u25a0 . ,

LOVE OF CHILD
BRINGS REUNION
William Callinan, Leader of
Columbia Orchestra, Weds
Former Wife in Oakland
COUPLE SEEM HAPPY
After Three Years' Separa
tion They Remarry Out of
Affection for Little Girl
OAKLAND, Oct. 12. â Love for their
little child effected to-day the reconcil
iation of an estranged husband and
wife, who. after three years of separa
lion, were reunited by a second mar
riage. The srroom was William G. Cal
linan, leader of the orchestra at. the
Columbia Theater in San Francisco, and
the bride was the woman who, three
years ago. was granted a divorce from
him. It nay iÂ»c possible that the au
dience that sits bohind Callinan may
discover a new note in his music thax
heretofore has been absent, and it may
possibly be accounted for by the once
lost haupinoss that has been returned.
At any rate Mr. and Mrs. Callinan
seemed very happy to-day when they
went to the County Clerk's office and
secured a marriage license and a little
later secured the services of Justice of
the Peace Quinn, who pronounced them
once more man and wife. But it was
the little daughter to whom was given

SOCIETY MUCH
INTERESTED IN
COGHILL DEBUT
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND. Oct. 12. â In this age of rapid
action and quick results many good old cus
toms are frequently overlooked. It is only
the old families now who seem to deem a
young woman's introduction to society of
enough importance to make it a formal affair.
The maid of to-day doeÂ« her hair a little
higher, adds a few inches to her skirts and
steps irom the schoolroom Into the social whirl
without any more ado. But a girl's "comlnÃ
out" is really an epoch In her lite, an oc
casion that marks the dividing line between
Childhood and womanhood, and it lÂ» a sweet
centiment that makes the event a gala. day.
The Stanleys and the CoghlHs have long
been prominent in Oakland affairs and are
included among this city's aristocratic fam
ilies, so the social debut of Miss Bessie Cog
hill, daughter of Mrs. Thomas B. CoghtU
and granddaughter of Mrs. John A. Stanley,
will be an Important social event. Cards are
out for October 26. and many fashionables from
both sides of the bay are included in the in
vitations. A large receiving party will assiu
Mrs. Coghill and her mother, Mrs. Stanley.
Mrs. Oecar Fltxallen Long gave lovers of
music a delightful hour or two to-day by pre
vailing upon her friend, Mrs. Fletcher Copp of
Boston to give an Illustrated talk on the
work she has been doing in the East. England
and Germany. Magnetic, earnest and thorough
ly conversant with her subject, Mrs. Copp
fairly sweeps musical knowledge into one'k
brain with a masterful clarity and sureness
that Is irresistible. Plainly and inelegantly
expressed. Mrs. Copp'g art consists in Teaching
music teachers how to teach. By her system
(hildren grasp the first principles of harmony
aÂ« easily as Mother Goose. Like Columbus
and the egg. It* simplicity is marvelous.
Mrs. Long, herself a musician and composer
of more than ordinary ability, has been keenly
Interested in Mrs. Copp Â«nd her work having
been in fact one of the several prominent wo
men who hay? taken advantage of Mrs. Copp'*
visit to California to become familiar with
her system. Mrs. Copp leaves for Portland
to-morrow. She will probably be Mrs Long's
guest again for a short time before returning
to her home In Boston. Among the Interested
auditors In the auditorium of the Nurses'
Home, where Mrs. Copp entertained her guests
to-day, were Mrs. Melvln C. Chapman, Mrs.
H. C. Capwell, Mrs. Charles Egbert Mrt
Arthur Holland. Mrs. *J. H. Mathews Mrs'
John F. Connors, Miss Anita Thompson Mrs
W. E. Sharon. Mrs. Charles Woodbury, Mrs
R. A. Bray and Miss .Connors.
Mlsb Mabel Gray. Mien Martha Coffin and
Miss Charlotte Hall were the lucky scorers
at Miss May Coogan's card party yesterday
The Coogan home In Linda Vinta was charm
ingly decorated with the eeason'n blossoms,
adding color and fragrance to the always
cheery and hospitable atmosphere of this
pleasant home. A bevy of society girls as
sisted Misa Coogan. the affair being compli
mentary to Mrs. Murray Orrick, Mrs. Traylor
Bell and Miss Jean Downer.
SARGENT STILL HELD.
OAKLAND, Oct. , 12.â Until Earle A.
Sargent, the university student burg
lar, is represented in court by his at
torneys, Judge Ellsworth states he
will not sentence him to State Prison
and he must remain In the County Jail
another day without any special care
for the serious Injury to his brain
caused by a policeman's bullet.
It is a peculiar quirk of the' law that
ties him down, but while he was repre
sented by attorneys a year ago, at
which time he pleaded guilty to bur
glary and was admitted to probation,
he is not on trial, for the law provides
he can be picked up at any time and
sentenced for the offense to which he
pleaded guilty. For fear of error, how
ever, he will not be sentenced until his
attorneys can be produced In court.
Another point suggested by the doc
tors is that at the present- time he is
not altogether competent owing to his
injury and it may be pleaded that he
is so far insane as not to be eligible
to State Prison, but rather a patient
for an insane asylum.
REFUSES PISTOL PERMIT.
OAKLAND, Oct. 12.â Mayor Mott has
declined to issue a permit to Mrs. Eliza
beth Baker to carry a pistol. Mrs. Baker
represented that she feared her husband,
Joseph Baker, a carpenter/ from whom
she Is separated. The Mayor held that
the law did not encourage the carrying
of weapons under such conditions. Be
sides. Baker is given an excellent repu
tation for peace, quiet and Industry.

MURDER RUNS
RIOT ON SHIP
WILMINGTON, N. C. Oct. 12.â Her
decks and cabins splotched with blood
from the butchery following the mu
tiny aboard the ship early Tuesday
morning off the North Carolina coast,
the four-masted schooner Harry A.
Berwlnd of Philadelphia was towed
into Southport to-day by Wilmington
tugs.
Aboard were the prize crew of the
New York schooner Blanche H. King,
who were wanted as witnesses against
the three -negroes shackled and
brought to the Cape Fear quarantine
station on Wednesday, charged with
mutiny and murder.
At the preliminary investigation be
fore United States Commissioners Col
lier of Wilmington and Pinner of
Southport to-day the men who board
ed the Berwlnfl told the story of con
ditions on the vessel as they found
them and the prisoners were then in
troduced at their own reauest. They
gave their names as Robert Sawyer,
Henry Scott and Arthur Adams, all
negroes, and under 40 years of age.
Sawyer and Adams employed counsel
and both charged that Scott did the
killing of the five men with the ex
ception of Captain Rumill, who disap
peared before daybreak on Tuesday in
a manner of which they knew noth
ing.
Each said he saw Scott shoot the
mate on the lee side of the ship and
throw his body overboard. Then he
killed the engineer and went down the
companionway. Very soon they heard
shots below deck in the galley and a
short while thereafter Scott came up
again, bringing the body of the cook,
a small white man, in his arms, drop
ping his burden over the rail. They
afterward bound Scott and were steer
ing the vessel as best they could until
overhauled by the Blanche H. King.
Scott says all the seamen, four ne
groes, formed a conspiracy soon after
leaving Mobile, September 23, feeling
outraged because .of short rations. He
said he killed no one except Cokely,
the negro seaman found on deck, and
that he killed him in self-defense.
Cokely, he claimed, hit him With a
stick and shot at him while he was
bound. He attempted no explanation
of why he had been bound except that
his companions wanted to get rid of
him after the trouble. He said he saw
Cokely shoot the mate and saw Adams
kill the engineej. He does' not know
how the cook was Jellied, as the shoot
ing was below deck.
Scott is a mulatto and claims to be
a Britisn subject from St. Vincent
Island. All three negroes were held
without bail and are confined in the
Southport Jail for the Federal Court in
Wilmington in November. ,

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Odt 12 â
The annual issue of the Stanford Foot
ball Song Book appeared on the quad
for sale to-day and was eagerly sought
for by all. The demand was due to the
fact that the book contains a number
of new songs and yells which have
been added to the vocabulary of the
cardinal rooter. Besides the new addi
tions it was rumored that, the old tried
and true songs which: treated of
football heroes would be modernized
and the purchasers were,- not disap
pointed.
"After the Game," written by Larrey
Bowman '01. deals with the custom of
the winning team "serpentining" down
Market street after the game. As the
games have been discontinued in San
Francisco and will ' henceforth take
place on either the local or Berkeley
campus, the words have been altered
to fit. The names of California's coach,
Knibbs, and. several local characters of
Palo Alto have been used with freedom.
The new additions are "The Conquer
ing Cardinal," by Paul C. Edwards, the
song which took the first prize In the
last contest; "Berkeley's Finish," which
won, the second prize, by Jack- Sheehy
'06 and Arch Perrln '06; "The Serpent
ine Song," by P. C. Edwards and H. F.
Curran, and the piece . entitled "The
Loyal Stanford Men," by L. S. Levy '08.
In the yell column the prize yell by
E. A. Cunha '06 is the main addition.
The authorities of the university
have also put an annual pamphlet on
sale. This publication, "The Directory
of Officers and Students of the Leland
Stanford University," although not as
good a "seller" as the book of the Asso
ciated Students, is nevertheless the ob
ject of considerable curiosity and con
cern. In this pamphlet, nicknamed by
the student community "The Bawl Out,' 1
are the number of university credits
which each member of the university
has to his credit and the . number of
flunks to his discredit.
BANKERS FAVOR
SHIP SUBSIDIES
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12.â The American
Association of Bankers to-day put Itself
squarely on record as favoring : Govern
ment subsidies for the upbuilding "of the
American merchant marine. /Resolutions
reviewing the growth of American" com
merce and the decline in American ship
ping and pledging the association to throw
the weight of -its influence toward the
enactment of a ship-subsidy law were
presented by the executive council of the
association and adopted by a rising vote,
In which it was estimated that three
quarters of the delegates took the af
firmative^ side.
The reoort of the currency committee
was received, but no action taken \u25a0there
on. The reyort followed the suggestions
made yesterday by Secretary Shaw in his
address before the convention for an
emergency currency.
The enthusiasm of the day was vented
on the ship-subsidy proposition. The five
enacting clauses of the resolution are as
follows:
ResoJved. By the American Bankers' Asso
ciation assembled: First. That the members
of this association are deeply Interested In
any measure which wi'l promote the' Interest
of the whole country, commercially and..indus
trially, and especially, with reference to bur
foreign commerce.
Second, That we favor and most respectfully
urge the passage by Ctongress of some measure
to foster and encourage the upbuilding of our
merchant marine, and give us back the pres
tige upon the high eeas which we once en-
Joyed.
Third, That we favor the ship subsidy meas
ure which has received consideration by Con
gress, which, we think, would tend to re
store our flag upon the seas, and build up our
merchant marine to the extent that the neces
sities of our trade now and In the future may
demand. \u25a0 4
Fourth, That wÂ« recommend that our Sena
tors- and Congressmen favor some Just and
equitable measure that will bring about th*
results and afford the relief above suggested.
Fifth, That through our legislative commit
tee we memorialize the Senate and the House
of Representatives of the United States with
a copy of these resolutions. . â¢ ,
An interesting history of the Scotch
system of banking was presented to the
convention by Robert Blythe, general
manager Of the Union Bank of Scotland,
located at Glasgow. The first Scotch
bank was established in 1695. To-day
there are but ten , banks In Scotland,
seven doing nine-tenths of the business.
The chief characteristic of the Scotch
system is the right of. the banks to is
sue the .one-pound note, as the- result
of which- Scotland retains to-day her
paper currency almost to the exclusion of
metal currency, while thereverse is true
in England.
During the last half century there have
been but two bank failures in Scotland. .
1 The Currency Committee's report was
1 then presented. The report states that,
if some plan of currency reform could
be- aerced upon. Congress might be In
duced to take action. It was ffiven-as
! the opinion of the committee that such
legislation should provide that United
! States notes of legal tenders should be
retired if practicable. . Also that a suf-
I flcient. restrve fund should be set aside
in the United States Treasury to provide
for the redemption in gold of about $600,
000.000.-of silver outstanding; that the
Secretary of the Treasury, should have
discretionary power to deposit in .the
national banks such portion of the surplus
fund in excess: of $50,000,000, whether de
! rived from customs receipts or internal
revenue, as .he may deem proper to pre
vent absorption < of money by the treas
ury, such deposits to be guaranteed by
United I States I bonds jor pother securities
acceptable ; to the Secretary. [ \u0084â¢\u25a0.-..
It 1 further \u25a0 advocates an amendment or
repeal of the ' limitation of $3,000,000 : per
month upon the withdrawal of circulation
by national banks so ; that the limit
should be. either $6,000,000 or $10,000,000, or
to, abolish the limit, that expansion and'
contraction . might ; In a measure i become
automatic,-, allowing the Issuance in times
of financial stress of supplemental : cur
rency (along the lines suggested by Sec
retaTyJ Shaw.'SO. as , to "appear. Identical
with -.the. present national bank . notes,
but .heavily, taxed so as to secure its re
tirement; as', soon as stringent conditionsi
had passed ;' this currency not to ' appear,
as any new . form of " money,-; but * to be
guaranteed by the Grovernment, and banks
holding 50 per cent ; 6f their capital In
INVESTIGATING
CHILD'S DEATH
Sausalito Babe Is Believed
to Have Died Because of
Neglect of Its Parents
TINY BODY IS EXHUMED
Offer of Doctor to Treat In
fant Without Charge Is Re
fused by Father and Mother
Spocial Cable to Tba Call.
SAUSALITO, Oct. 12.â The body of Ma
rie Brazil, a two weeks old infant who
died Saturday and, was buried in Sausa>
lito cemetery last Monday without a
death certificate and a burial permit was
exhumed to-day to enable Justice Pryor,
acting Coroner, to hold- an Inquest. I>r.
Mays performed an autopsy and gave
gastritis as the cause of death.
Dr. R. B. Williams testified at the in
quest that he treated the child once and
prescribed for her. The child was yin a
critical condition. After treating the
child, Dr. Williams said. Braall the baby's
father sent for medicine several times
but refused to accept his services fur
ther even when offered for nothing.
The parents could not be found to-day
and as the jury insisted on their appear
ance the inquest was adjourned until
Monday when it is expected that the
parents will be present. It is evidently
the opinion of the jurymen that the child's
life could have been saved by proper
medical attendance.'
Albane Wray, Superintendent of the
Sausalito cemetery was arrested to-day
on a charge of violating the new State
birth and death registration law^ by per
mitting the interment of the Brazil child
without a burial permit and doctor's
death certificate. He deposited $50 cash
ball with Justice Pryor.
DOG CAUSES LAWSUIT.
PALO ALTO. Oct. 12.â Both L. G.
Rowe of San Francisco and Mrs. M.
Johnson of Palo Alto have laid claim
to a wandering dog, with the result
that a suit to determine the ownership
of the canine was brought before
Judge Thomas here yesterday. Mrs.
Johnson said she found the animal on
the university campus and believed it
was the one she lost in 1901. Rowe
said It was the dog he lost in Mountain
View in 1904. Judge Thomas awarded
the dog to Rowe.
TROUBLE AHEAD
FOR VENEZUELA
Special Dispatch to The Call.
?I CALL. . BUREAU,.. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Oct. 12. â Conferences
between Judge .Calhoun and Secretary
Root and betweenfSecretary Root and
French . Embassador Jusserand were
held to-day at the State Department.
Both, were upon the subject of difficul
ties between- the French Cable Com
pany and . Venezuela and the attitude
which would, or should, be assumed
by the United States In case France
decided to enforce the claims of her
cftizens.
The fact that Judge Calhoun has rec
ommended to the administration that
the United States allow France to pro
ceed to use forcible or other measures
to make good the claims of the Cable
Company is practically admitted in of
ficial circles.'. It is equally a fact that,
in some manner, news of this recom
mendation has been cabled back to
Venezuela and Is believed to be the
cause of the more conciliatory attitude
assumed by President Castro within
the last two days.
None of the parties to the conference
to-day would admit that anything had
been done In the premises, .but it is
known that France is anxious to have
the United States take parallel action,
based upon the claims of the New York
and BermudeZ Company and that M.
Jusserand had been informed that the
United States' would not unite with
France or any other country in action
against Venezuela.
Secretary Root is following the prin
ciple laid down first by President
Roosevelt in his message to Congress
of December 3, 1901, and emphasized
by Secretary Hay in the memorandum
which he sent to Embassador Holleben
of Germany on December 16 of that
year. In this he said:
"The Monroe doctrine does not guar
antee any State' against punishment if
It misconducts Itself, provided that
punishment, does not take the form ot
acquisition of territory by any non-
American power."

TOKIO. Oct. 12.â Vice Admiral Sir
Henry Gerald Noel, commanding the
British squadron now at Yokohama, ac
companied by a numerous suite, ar
rived here this morning .by a special

ent included Marquis Ito, president of
the Privy Council, and the Cabinet
Ministers.
After an exchange of greetings Ad
miral .Noel and his party entered Im
perial carriages arid were driven to

programme, the Mayor delivered a
Hpeech of welcome. He said he was
honored and delighted to receive an ad
miral of a navy with such a brilliant
history and .belonging to a country
which Japan was proud to ; caM her
ally In guarding the peace of the

gretted that Toklo was unable more
adequately to express the sincerity of
Japan's welcome. Admiral Noel re
plied briefly.
During the day about 1000 British
sailors and marines arrived here and
were treated with the greatest friend

in the park to watcn the trials of
strength and skill, others, attended by
guides and interpreters, walked or
drove through the streets and enjoyed
themselves in sightseeing. The pres

sesame everywhere. The t streetcars
were free to them and special discounts
were allowed them wherever possible.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
VALLEJO. Oct. 12.â At to-day's ses
sion of the court martial of Commander
Lucien Young of the Bennlngton lieuten
ant Commander Bartlett was upon tlia
witness stand all day. For mor* than
two hours he was rigidly cross^Trnrn
incd by Naval Constructor Evans with
out being tangled. The passages were
sharp anil many of the members of tho
court who have varied ttie dreary routine
of the proceedings by reading newspa
pers during: the court's session, sat up
and listened.
At the morning session Bartlett told of
his services as the senior member of the
board of Inquiry that convened at BÂ»n
Diego shortly after the explosion an-r
his testimony covered a great deal ft
matter with which the public is alrea 1
familiar. He said that a plate 6xS inch
bad been taken for the collapsed fu
t Dace and drilled in order to determii
â¢the character of the material compos
ing the plate. The drilling showed that
*9 steel was of a good quality. These
I Killings were forwarded to the Navy De-
I pirtment.
Ifpon a direct question from Judge j
Advocate Weat Bartlett stated that ha "Â«
had never known of a crown sheet t > \
collapse from overheating. Bartlett sa.-i :
that bÂ» had quallfleU as an expert by
servltg six years as an instructor at the
Naval Academy. West asked Bartlett a
number <Â»f general hypothetical questions
attempting to secure from him a state
ment that the pressure exceeded the
safety liiaiX of 145 pounds. The defense ob
jected strongly to this line of questions,
but after thirty minutes deliberation the
objections were not sustained and the an-
I swer which the defense had striven with
all its might to keep out was admitted.
! Bartlett could not state how much over
j H5 pounds the pressure had reached, as
steam rises Tery rapidly after
that point. â¢
Bartlett was still on the stand at the
close of the day's session, and will likely
finish up to-morrow morning. Just pre
vious to adjournment Evans asked Bart
lett it' he considered himself an expert
on material and Bartlett responded th;
he did. Evans came back quickly am
[asked the witness !f he is an expert on
the testing of material. Bartlett replied
no. This answer brought Evans to Ms
feet In a minute with a demand that all
of Bartletfs testimony be stricken out.
It was the climax oX the day's lung cross
examination and a .bold effort, but the'
board refused to alluXv it. i
It is expected that* Ensign Wade, wh > <\
will be the star witness, will be placed,]
on the stand this morning.

Supreme Tribunal Holds
Misdemeanors Under Code
Out of Their Jurisdiction
OTIS WINS HIS SUIT
Los Angeles Newspaper Man
Not Gruilty of Contempt
of Southern Grand Jury
The Supreme Court yesterday handed
down an important decision in the case
of D. H. Robert vs. the Police Courts of
San Francieco and Judge A- J. Fritz.
The case is founded on the criminal
ilbel action brought by Assessor Wash
ington Dodge against Robert in Judge
Fritz's Police Court. Robert petitioned
to the Sbpreme Court, claiming that
tht. Police Court had no jursidotion.
In supporting the contention of Ro
bert the Supreme Court states that the
Police Courts have no jurisdiction to
try any misdemeanor which is made a
misdemeanor by the Political Code of
the State. Its only right to try mis
demeanors is the right to try those
made such by a municipal ordinance.
General Harrison Gray Otia, editor
of the Ix>s Angeles Times, won hie ao
tlon against the Superior Court of the
county of lx>s Angeles before the Su
preme Court yesterday afternoon. Otis
end an employe, Chandler, were con
victed of contempt of the Los Angeles
Grand Jury because of certain articles
appearing in the Times. The Supreme
Court held that while every court had
the exclusive right to determine what
was contempt before It and while there
was contempt, yet the affidavits failed
to connect Otis and Chandler with the
offense.

FEMALE PRISONER
FINDS GREAT FUN
IN POLICE COURT
Laughs at Judge's Quips and Her
Veil Irritates His Nerves.
Unable to Repress Her Mirth, She
Hoists Her Face Curtain.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Miss Florence St. CUir, blue-gowned
and patent-leather batted, giggled behind
a rather opaque white veil until Police
Judge Cabaniss gave her the alternative
of curbing her hilarity or removing the
face cloak.
"AVhy?" she tittered.
"Because the fluttering and bellying
and sagging of thai gauze fabric each
time you laugh in wearing on the nerves
of the beholder," was the answer.
"Oh, dear; I might as well take it oft."
she Â«aid. raising the curtain and exposing
a countenance whose age-lines had not
been entirely routed by derma tological
art. "It's useless to expect me to keep
a straight face while you go on saying
them things," she added by way of ex
planation.
She did maintain facial placidity, how
ever, until Policeman Dunham testified
he arrested her on Eddy street and the
Judge asked him If he had said Easy
street and then she fairly guffawed.
'"There you go again." she spluttered.
"Easy street: Ha. ha! The lde-ah!
You'll be the death of me if you don't let
up! Oh. dear: Eddy street an easy
street! Oh, I'll dieâ l know I shall! Ha,
ha, ha!"
She was dancing upon a sidewalk, the
policeman resumed, and when he com
manded her to desist she said he was
jealous because he could not dance aa
well as she did.
"Did I say that?" she almost screamed,
holding her sides. "Oh, dear! Ha. ha!
I've read of the funny things in these
p'llce courts, but I thought the papers
were jist joshing!" ' % y, '~
When she had recovered from the par
oxysm and gingerly swabbed up the
streaming eye-moisture from her pink
cheeks his Honor dismissed her with
the reprimand usually bestowed upon a
first offender. .â¢: T
Chronic impecunioslty and an inappeas
able craving for beer are the most in
fluential handicaps of John Johnson's
life, and on two known occasions they
combined to provoke him to commit petty
larceny by stealing a bottle of the foamy
beverage.
The first time Mr. Johnson was arrested
his plea of poverty won for him dis
missal and a warning *by Judge Fritz,
and the second time he was placed before
the same bench with a different occu
pant, for Judge Cabaniss was tempor
arily acting for his brother magistrate,
indisposed. Another acquittal might have
rewarded a repetition of the poverty
plea., for the Judge did not know the de
fendant and was leniently inclined, but,
instead of taking advantage of the situa
tion, Mr. Johnson indiscreetly asked for
and was granted a continuance of the
case until to-day, when Judge Fritz will
be Ln his wonted seat and with a most
remarkable memory for faces unimpaired
by his brief indisposition.
.When a bailiff whlsperingly elucidated
to Mr. Johnson the blunder he had made,
he frantically endeavored to get his case
reopened and disposed of right there and
then, but the effort was futile.
"It'll be at least thirty days for you,"
murmured the officer.'
"And thirty years 'd be no more'n I
dererve for my blasted foolishness," was
Mr. Johnson's response, delivered In bit
ter tone.
It was Mrs. B. Henzbrun's semi
monthly afternoon to receive callers at
her home, 7% Bykana place, and
among: those who dropped in and
sipped tea and nibbled cake and gos
sfped was Mrs. Louise Bower. So de
lightfud was Mrs. Bower's small talk
that the hoÃtess prevailed on her to
outstay all the other visitors, and
when Mrs. Henzbrun interrupted a
charming tete-a-tete to adjourn to the
commissary department and replenish
the refreshment tray, she returned, to
be both surprised- and dismayed by
Mrs. Bower's eagerness to depart.
"Why, who ever heard of such a
thing?" said Mrs. Henzbrun. "Sit right
down again, my dear, and have another
cup of tea. You must finish what you
started to tell me about Mrs. Whatser
name. I always did think that woman
wasn't what" â \u25a0
"But really, I must go," Mrs. Bower
insisted. "It's so late now that I'll
never be able to get dinner ready in
time for" â v r
"I won't hear of your going," Mrs.
Henzbrun declared. "As I was saying,
that Mrs. Whatser" â
"You must come -and see me â first
and third Tuesdays, you know," was
Mrs. Bower's response, and her tone In
dicated it was final. .So with a sigh
of regret Mrs. Henzbrvfn allowed her to
go forth.
A few minutes afterward Mrs. Henz
brun missed a $10 gold coin from her
purse, which Mrs. Bower had free op
portunity to rifle while the tray was
being replenished, and that was how
Mrs. Bower came to be accused of lar
ceny by Mrs. Henzbrun. Judge Mogan
continued the hearing till next Monday.
A few days of enforced confinement
and deprivation of opium filled the soul
of Quong Tung with a great pity for
his incarcerated fellow slaves of the
poppy juice, and â¢he resolved that he
would celebrate his restoration to free
dom by endeavoring to smuggle to
them a quantity of the solacing drug.
So when he was pronounced not guilty
of the charge of having attempted to
burglarize the I. Goldman, residence, on
McAllister street, he hastened to
Chinatown, procured . several pasty
"pills," returned to the City Prison and
was surreptitiously trying to transfer

ing trial for j murder, when an argus
eyed jailer detected him in the act and
promptly locked him up.
Quong Tung, the jailer and the opium
were placed before Judge Mogan, who
continued the case until to-morrow.
Pursuant to the rules and regula
tions promulgated by the ' Barbers'
Union for the mutual convenience of
its members and the public. L. E. Mar
tin (colortd), whose gayly striped pole
projects from the sidewalk fronting
2503 J.& Greenwich street, was closing,
his shop at S o'clock p. m., when Wil
liam J. Kennedy, a private soldier from
the Presidio, abruptly appeared and
demanded that he be shaved.
"Kaln't do It en retain man good
standln' In de union." Mr. Martin ex
plained... *
"Yer union ain't nuthin' ter me,"
quoth Private Kennedy. "I've got to
be shaved right now 'cause I'm a-goin'
t' walk with a young woman what
won't hey nuthin' t' do with whiskers.
So j'ou'd better open up an' git t'
work 'cause I don't want t' keep her
a-waitln' fer me."
"But de union, sah, hez suthln' teh
do wif me," the tonsor retorted. "Ef
Ah'd git expelled fo' scrapin' yo' 'face
de whole 'Kited Stets ahmy couldn't
git me restohe"d back ag'ln." \u25a0
Finding that suasion was useless
Private Kennedy endeavored to bribe,
but Mr. Martin stood firmly by his re
fusal. "Et kaln't be did," he declared.
"Yo' pay fo' a whole yeah wouldn't
'duce me teh totch yo' face wif no raz
zah dis yah night." Then the soldier
requested permission to shave himself
with Mr. Martin's implements, but that
overture, too, was rejected. i "It ain't
alone de act ob shavin' aftah 8 p. m.
Dat de union objecks to," he said, 'but
de use ob de tools as well. "No, sah,
yo' kaln't hey jo chin cleaned In dls
yah shop dls yah night undah no suc
cumstances whatsumdevvah."
Further argument was exchanged ere
the soldier battered the barber and
broke the window and was arrested for
so doing. Asked by Judge Cabaniss if
the battery was serious. Mr. Martin re-
plied, "No, sah;. he hit obah de tem
pohal region wif his fist," signifying
the .spot that had. been smitten by
placing the point of an index finger
on his left temple. When he expressed
willingness :to withdraw the battery
accusation if the defendant would pay
for the broken window the suggestion
was promptly acceded to and thus was
the case disposed of. <Â»-
A jury in Judge Mogan's court ac
quitted "Dr." Wung Woo of.tha charge
of having practiced medicine without
being duly certificated to do so by the
State Board of Medical Examiners, by
whose instrumentality he had been ar
rested. ;
The prosecuting evidence consisted of
a circular. issued by the defendant, in
which he announced himself as a phy
sician and surgeon and claimed ability
to knock out, almost any ailment that
human ilesh .la heir to. Moreover, a
female "spotter" employed by the board
testified that when she visited the de
fendant's office, 794" Clay â¢ street, and
falsely represented to him that she was
suffering from an affection of the
throat, he opened her mouth, peered
long and Intently into the orifice and
then sold t<j her for $1 a bottle of .herb
brew, which, he assured her, would
quickly effect a cure. This lady in

disclosed that she is. a divorcee and
alternates tolling in a candy factory

her reward for the 'latter service being
B0 per cent of any fine imposed through

; The defense emphasized the fact that
Wung Woo could .not have ob
tained a certificate to .practice medi

Internal Revenue Agent
Describes How He Found
Papers in Deputy's Desk
United States Internal Revenue Agent
Thomas occupied the witness stand yes
terday In i the United States District
Court, testifying in the case of the
United States vs. George A. Wright. He
told how \u25a0 he came to light upon the fact
that certain offers of compromise had
been withheld by' the defendant and not
forwarded to Washington. It appeared
that A. H. Shooshan, a "moonshiner" of
Fresno, informed Mr. Thomas in Octo
ber, 1904, that he had paid $3i2 into the
internal revenue office in t~Â«s city. The
witness asked Wright whether he had
received the money and'' 'he replied
promptly that he had.
Thomas made a demand upon Wright
then and there for the money and
Wright turned over $50 that he had in
the safe. Then Thomas began an in
vestigation and found twenty-nine offers
of compromise in a drawer of Wright's
desk, among them one' from William
Wolf of this city, offering $1667 as revenue
tax on a lot of whisky rejmported from
Manila. Mr. Thomas further testified
that on November 3, 1904, Internal Rev
enue Collector John C. Lynch* paid into
| the treasury $4252 to make up the short
! age. J
Mr. Thomas will be cross-examined this
morning by Samuel M. â¢ Shortridge and
Bert Schlesinger, counsel for the defense.
Assistant United States Attorney A. P.
Black said yesterday that the case was
being prosecuted under Section 5497, Re
vised Statutes, which impose a penalty
upon any United States officer for em
bezzling money, whether the property of
the Government or of any other party or
person.
BOAED OF WORKS
IS ANGEY AGAIN
Objects to the Control of-
Funds Being Taken
From It.
The Commissioners of Works are up in
aims over the action of the Board of
Supervisors in taking away from them
the control of the appropriations for pub
lic improvements in the municipal budget
of the present fiscal year. The matter was
Informally discussed by the Commission
ers yesterday and will be taken up at
next Wednesday's session.
Among the appropriations is one of
$6000 for the repair of the Fourth and
Sixth street bridges. The . Supervisors
recently adopted a resolution authorizing
the Board of Works to expend $1000 of
the appropriation to repair the .bridges,
with the intention of dealing out the
money in six installments. The Board of
Works holds that the repairing cannot
be done piecemeal and that the entire
$6000 * is' inadequate' for the purpose. It
was pointed out "during the discussion
that the Fourth-street -bridge needs new
boilers and that both bridges are in need
of painting to prevent corrosion. '
Just what the Board of Works intends
to do in the matter was not decided at
yeatdrday's conference, but its action will
probably take the form of a resolution
notifying the Board of Supervisors that
the repairs to the Fourth and Sixth street
bridges cannot be properly made on the
installment plan and that the entire
amount appropriated must be made avail
able so that a contract can be awarded.

as devisees in the will of the deceased,
petitioned the Superior Court for the
removal of James L. Nagle as executor
thereof. The petition tor Nagle's re
moval has brought to light facts that
promise to develop into a scandal.
The charge is made that Executor
Nagle and his brother, Charles "> G.
Nagle, sought by means not recognized
by the code to pass a claim against the
estate' for a sum much greater than,
it is alleged, is due them, the accused
attorneys having resource to the sub
terfuge of assignment, made first" to
their father, .P. B. Nagle, and subse
quently to other persons. The facts of
the case, as outlined before Judge Cof
fey yesterday, are as follows:
ASSIGMIESTS FIGURE.
. Elizabeth, lioyne, who died on August
2, left an estate of $5000. Some time
before, her death she secured the ser
vices of Nagle & Nagle, attorneys, to
look after her affairs. Taeir compen
sation for services performed and to
be performed was $2500, secured by a
mortgage, bearing interest at the rate
of 10 per cent annually and due two
years alter date. This business was
transacted in February, 1902. Men
tioned In the woman's will were several
beneficiaries, who were left small sums.
Among them were Fathers Wyman,
Yorke and Caraher.
James L. Nagle was named as execu
tor of the will. On September 10 the
will was admitted to probate, but two
days previous to this James L. and
Charles G. Nagle, the latter acting; as
attorney for the former, made an as
signment of their $2500 claim to their
father, P. B. Nagle. When P. B. Nagle's
claim was presented before Judge Cook
of the Superior Court it was approved.
A petition was subsequently filed by
the three clergymen to set aside the al
lowance of P. B. Nagle's claim and It
was granted. The father and two sons
then made an assignment to Thomas
Moran of Oakland, a client of the
Nagles, to secure a- promissory \u25a0 note
of $1500. Then Moran made an assign
ment to a Dr. H. J. Conrad of this city,
who is also "said to be a client, of the
Nagles. P. B. Nagle Jr., who Is at
torney for Conrad, next filed a com
plaint to foreclose the mortgage in the
name of Julian Pinto.
JUDGE COFFEY SARCASTIC.
After these facts became known, At
torney Humphrey of the firm of Lent
& Humphrey made further Investiga
tions, and, so he announced in court
yesterday, discovered that the claim al
lowed for funeral expenses and passed
by the executor was $111 more than
the undertaker's bill called for. /Then
a demand was made that James L.
Nagle resign as executor. _
VI will not resign," said James Xagle
yesterday, addressing ; Judge' Coftey.
"Your Honor can understand my posi
tion in this case as a lawyer and If neo
essary an appeal to .the Supreme
Court â "
"No, I cannot understand your posi
tion In this case, nor can I appreciate
It as a lawyer," answered Judge Coffey
sarcastically. "My Imagination is not
sufficiently nourished ' for the ordeal.
And in announcing a desire to appeal
something to the Supreme Court you
seem to anticipate the decision of this
court, and sometimes anticipations are
realized." >.';\u25a0
Nagle made no response and the
court ordered the petition for the re
moval of the executor under submis
sion.

RATE LEGISLATION.
rr^HE c?.se of the railroads, hi the matter of rate legislation, has
| been restated by President Spencer of the Southern Railway.
1 His statement is. of course, extreme. It assumes that. the Fed
eral Commission, which will have the power to review and revise
a rate on complaint 6t a shipper, will be irresponsible and willful in
its action, inflicting harm upon railroad property and interrupting
the relations between railroads and their patrons.
No fault can be found with his choice of an extreme view of the
matter. It is proper policy from his standpoint, and it balances the
opposite extreme. Between the two lies the middle ground, which
will no doubt be taken by the proposed \ legislation. The law at
present gives, the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to
hear complaints against rates, and to decide cases by substituting
another fur the rate complained of. But it has no power to en
force thtr substituted rate pending a review of its decision on ap
peal to the courts.
The country understands the Esch-Townsend bill to provide
that the substituted rate shall go into effect immediately, and shall
continue in effect pending appeal. No legislation can prevent an
appeal to the courts, for that is a constitutional right and cannot
be suspended or abolished. As the rigjit of appeal will exist, Mr.
Spencer puts it very strong when he denounces the proposed legisla
tion as "Commercial lynch law." The control of transportation is
the power to control production and exchange of commodities. If
thai control had always been exercised wisely there would be no
agitation for the proposed legislation.
That agitation has its origin in what is known of the methods
of the Standard Oil Company. By the enjoyment of special rates,
not open to all, that trust was able to destroy competition and to
absorb the oil business entirely for its own benefit. This has
thrown all of the profits, on a business that covers one of the nec
essaries of life, jnto the pockets of a few men.
It is not necessary to depend upon any of the somewhat hys
terical attacks on the Standard Oil Company for argument that the
rate system by which it accomplished its monopoly is inimical to the
public interests. Nor is it necessary to depend upon any new prin
ciple in legislation for such argument. The common law of com
mon carriers, existing before there was a statute on the subject, re
quires equal service at equal price for all comers. It is pleaded in
behalf of Mr. Rockefeller that at the time he enjoyed^ secret rates,
not open to his competitors, there were no statutes against such
system.
That plea is invalid. Xo statute was necessary, for the secret
and privileged rate violated the common law rights of his rivals in
business. The proposed legislation is for the purpose of protecting
and enforcing those common law rights. We suppose that even
Mr. Spencer will admit that it is not equity, nor good business pol
icy, to give one man the benefit of a rate which under equal condi
tions is denied to another.
What he says about the agency of the railroads in building up
the country is cheerfully admitted. They have developed regions
and resources that otherwise would be still dormant. They have
done this and at the same time have reduced rates, until it is be
lieved that the open rates on American railways are the lowest in
the world, while the service is the best. At the same time it is
known that the roads give secret rebates to favored shippers which
place the disfavored at a disadvantage.
Take the case of two men in'the same line of business. If one
is favored by a secret, rebated rate, while the other pays the higher
open rate, he is compelled to pay part of the transportation on his
favored rival's goods, and thus is forced to contribute to his own
ruin. It should be understood by the railroad managers that if their
open rates are too low, if they do not yield revenue sufficient to keep
up the properties and maintain a first class equipment, and this is
made plain to the people, they will not object to a higher rate, but
it must be one rate for all.
Commercial and productive prosperity requires this and it re
quires also stability in rates. When one merchant has laid in his
stock at a certain freight rate, and that rate is unexpectedly low
ered by a rate war or other means, so that rival stocks may enjoy
it, the effect is exactly the same as that of a rebate. When a manu
facturer undertakes to fill a contract, estimated on an existing rate,
and in the midst of his performance has the rate changed to a
higher, he is wronged and perhaps ruined. We do not say that
railroad managers are unmindful of this need of stability and the
injustice of instability, but it is common knowledge that men are
ruined by such juggling^ of rates.
Any legislation that will force an equal rate for equal service
for all is in the interest of production and exchange, and is not in
imical to railroad property.
COTTAGE CRAFTS IN IRELAND.
REVIVAL of lace-making and other cottage industries in Ire
land to such an extent as to lift whole communities from that
grinding poverty which has been for so long the common lot
*bf the peasantry of the green isle is a pleasing thing to hear of.
Miss Ellen O'Reilly, who has been in charge of an exhibit of these
Irish lace-workers and representatives of other village industries,
has given an accbunt to the New York Eyening Post of what a
great good is coming to her country's poorer classes because of
this renewal of an old industry. They have long known how to
do excellent work in lace-making, but fashion had for many years
passed them by. The' new awakening is due to the interest mem
bers of the British aristocracy have taken in the beauty of the Irish
product.
The Roman Catholic sisters have been largely instrumental in
\u25a0 teaching the girls and women how to manufacture lace. They
have kept the art alive through the dull years, and now that a
better demand has come there are workers who are fitted to train
beginners at the delicate tasks. The convents do not enter into
the industry directly, but the sisters are kept busy teaching the
village women how to make marketable goods that will bring them
in more money than they could earn by going out to work in
factories.
'The instruction is also carried on by organizations of women
from the best of the county families; These establish classes in
the various villages. They furnish the materials free, and they
pay good prices for good work and find a market for it. Some of
the skilled workers are said to lift themselves to comparative
affluence by this means, and the ordinary workers earn a pound a
week, which is far better to them than working in the fields or
the factories.
The peasant girls can make the Carrickmacross, which is de
scribed as a cobweb texture, a very filmy stuff, made entirely with
the needle, and the designs as fine as frost work on a window.
pane. The Limerick lace is still finer and much more difficult
and few lace-workers attempt it. The convents, however/ have not
forgotten how to reproduce the finer designs of this, and can fur
nish teachers for it. It requires an extraordinary gift of dainty
and dexterous fingers to, succeed irrthe. Limerick patterns. ',
The crochet is said tn be the most characteristic lace of all
the Irish product. Miss Elizabeth Corbet Yeats, a sister of the
Irish poet, is at the head of the Don Elmer Guild, which has re
vived the ancient art of tapestry weaving. These are woven of
Tn'sh wool and are of fine designs. They also embroider linens and
pnint fans. The colors that are combined in these works are said
to be of a wonderful softness, "suggesting a brilliant landscape
viewed through perpetual mists."

A YOUNG MAN'S TROUBLE.
i 6 a LAS!" the young man sighed,
\u25a0/\ "if it were hotâ " ;
*Â» "If it were not'â what
were you going to say?" his
confidential friend inquired.
"I am, as you know, deeply in love
with Miss Prettigal. Naturally, we
would like to be married â that is, "I
should like to be, and she admits that
the feeling is not absolutely alien to
her breast â and if it were not â "
"Speak right out," his friend urged;
"you know that I will never betray
your confidence." i ; v/ ;: > -
â¢Why, we would be married almost
immediately â if it were not that I
should have to buy her provisions and
clothing and fuel and lodging and sev
eral other things. The situation is very
trying; it makes me feel badly."
Unfortunately his friend could ex
press little hope for him.
Moral: There are others.
A FOOL'S' WISDOM.
The race may not be to the swift,'
but I'm willing -to bet. a dollar that he
won't be distanced. ;
I may disapprove of Mr. Rockefeller's
commercial methods, but I seem to de
tect a yearning for hia cash /within
myself.
Of course, you understand that I do
not doubt that the flve-dollar-a-day
man who writes excoriations of inor
dinate wealth would not accept that
sort of riches if he had an opportunity.
A professional politician may be an
honest man, but he always is placed
under the painful necessity of prov
ing it. . *
Perhaps the Judge says, "What was
this soul's creed?" but some fools of
my kind doubt it- .
"Just 'as the twig is bent the tree's
inclined" â and I've noticed that if the
parents don't take the trouble to bend
it It usually warps itself considerably.
It is true that beauty is only skin
deep, but the fact has never put home
ly girls at a premium.
"D>d Blossom go to the seashore last
summer?"
"No. He said he deeply felt that it
was sufficient to have the fa.mily repre
sented, and his mother-in-law was
there."
THE THINGS I LOVE.
I love the balmy soothing air
-That wings

And things;
I love the birds that sing their song,
Enough
To cheer my heart the whole day long
With guff.
I love the breezes calm and sweet,
Each gust
That brings me visions joy replete,
And dust;
I dote on charms the vales supply.

Should smile!
ONCE MORK WITH ADOLPHUS.
It was a good deed that you did,
Adolphus, and. now that it has been
done, would you mind sitting down and
having a little conversation with your
self? If you do not mind, ask yourself
in all seriousness and. honesty whether
the deed was performed 'more because
you wished to poss*es" the consciousness
of doing the right -thing or because
you wished to feel that your friends
said, 'What a fine fellow Adolphus is!"
I suggest the question in all earnest
ness, my boy, and merely because I
have asked it of myself many and
many a time. I suppose, or at any l^ate
hope, that I am a person' of average
decency, but I: find, on calm and honest
introspectionr that the question, "What
will my' friends say of me?" mixes it
self with mauy of the things I do. I
really shouidT like to do the right for
the sake of doing- the right, but I don't
seem to be able to cut out the "What
will 'Jones say?" in the proposition;
and this Is not so much because I care
what Jones, the individual, thinks, as
it is because I fancy that Jones is a
representative of the great public.
If you will have an honest talk with
yourself, my boy, I will bet you two
to one that you will find that there la
a large ingredient of "Jones"- in your
doings. Why should I not suppose that
this is the case? I do not fancy that
my human nature Is very different from
other human nature, and I have talked
with myself. Nor Is it a bad thing to
mix some "Jones" in your proceedings.
Only, 1 should endeaver not to let him
"rule the roost," for when you do, you,
Adolphus, will be a nonentity.
"Old man Skadds is awfully distressed
about his Chawlie."
"Why so?" â¢
; "Well, he tried to train him to be use
ful, and already he has begun to go in
the Smart Set."
"You remember that old Duckets'
daughter married a foreigner with a
title?"
"Yes."
"Well, she has got a divorce from him.
"On what grounds ?"
"Fraudulent representations. On reach
ing Europe she found that titles were
selling for less than one-fourth of what
she paid.-" â¢:-f'~:>S'- : 7 ]
THE PRICE WE MUST PAY.
I know right well, and you know right
The thing that we ought to do, . .
But the tempter comes with a luring
spell.
And his wares have a roseate hue;
And we say, "This once,' if aside welook,
It will never count, I trow" â
But what of the one who keeps the book?
And don't you suppose He'll know?
Do you fancy that sin will leave no scar?
That law may be well defied? i- "
That you carry no mark of what you are
Far out on the other side? â¢
The wrong that -you did another yet
bears,
Will carry it all of the way,
And sure Is the time' when, unawares,
It will come, by your side to stay.
Oh,' I know right wellâ e'en my blindness
y seeÂ«â .
That the price we shall not escape;
The penalty comes despite our pleas,
~ To haunt us, a grizzly shape. .

MIRROR OF DAME FASHION.
PARISIAN COSTUME A LA PRINCESSE.
ONE of the new bluish violet shades of chiffon mohair makes up
charmingly In this street costume, or costume trotteur, as the
Parisians term them. While in cut it is plain enough for morning
and shopping wear, nevertheless it is sufficiently dressy in effect to
do duty for afternoon occasions as well. \u25a0 The skirt is built up. after
the princess model, jiist the hint of an underskirt cleverly indicated
at the left side, where, incidentally, the fastening occurs. Strappings
of the cloth, with little touches of the same bluish shade of violet
velvet, and velvet-covered buttons afford the trimming effect on the
skirt. The little Eton that completes the outdoor aspect of the gown
has the fronts rolled back in shallow reveres, haircloth lined, to hold
the shape, and touches of linen embroidery appear here with excel
lent effect. The sleeve is the usual half length model, and* the lace
underblouse is arranged with a cascaded jabot in front, and a sleeve
that displays a series of shallow puffs below the elbow.

envy them are the oneswho are striving
for this favor. Broadly speaking, we may
divide all mankind into these two classes.
There are 4 a few exceptions, but they are
insignificant when compared to the great
mass of the ruleâ barely enough of them
to prove the rule, writes Leigh Mitchell
Hodges in the Philadelphia North Amer
ican. â¢ \u25a0'
In short, we all want to succeed. And
this Is well enough. But the virtue of
our desire is altogether dependent on
what we want, to succeed at. The fact
that a murderer puts a large measure of
thought, energy and persistence into the
commission of his crime does not make
his act any the less wrong. He is still as
much a murderer as if he had done the
deed qn the spur of the moment in a fit
of anger. . V :.;'._.
And the fact that many men and wom
en put Into worthless or wrong work
many fine and useful qualities of mind
and body does not altar the result of their
laboring. The end is just aa bad as if
they had whiled away their time in,posi
tive vice. This is one phase, of the mat
ter that many do not stop to think about.
They should, for it ia highly important.
It is a phase of the matter that is con
stantly being brought to the' attention of
those persona who come in contact with
young men and young women starting out
in life to make their living or to take care
of others dependent upon them for sup
port. More than one letter touching upon
this very subject has come to mo and I
am thus led to a little talk on the sub
ject of the man who wins. Man, as used
in this Instance, includes women who
have to work. I do not want to talk to
working women who do not have to
work, because I have no. use for them.
Tha woman who goes clerking so that
she may have better looking, clothes and
more frillery and finery T, Is a robber of
bread; and though the most of working
women do not come under this head,
thanks be, there are enough of them to
warrant this passing comment. .
The man who- winsâ what sort Â«f a
man Is he?
In the first place there is and always

AN OPTIMIST
must be a vast difference between the
man who really wins and he who in
the sight of the world appears to win.
There ia an impassable gulf between
them. One is genuine, the other a
counterfeit. That's enough! And again
in the first; place, the man who. wins
is, as a rule, the man who starts out
with an idea of what he can do. and
what he is best fitted to do, and what
he " wants . to do, and . what he
is willing to do if he can't get any
of the others! It sounds like, a very
long list, but it can be boiled down
Into the man who knows something
about himself and has himself In his
own control to some extent. No man
ever controls himaelf wholly "or per
fectly, so It is not to be expected that
a young man should be proficient in
this beyond a certain point. '^
But do ships and railroad trains start
out from ports or depots without some
given statement and plan as to their
destination? If they did would any
sane man or woman patronize them?
Well, how, then, shall a young man
expect persons to take him If he sets
out no signs as to what he is going to
do? For, after all, success. of the right
sort is doing what you want to do.
And"~this.ls not selfish or strange. You
were made to do something better than
anything else and you ought to know
it, and do that.
And almost as important as^this is
the factâ remember, it is a fact â that
success ia not always a matter "of
money, and that success of the right
kind is'N^ever wholly -a matter of dol
lars and cents. Put tkis down where
you will see, it every day and every
hour of ever> day. There is a germ
in the air nowadays that takes root
in any one and every one and afflicts
its victims with a false notion that the.
best and highest way to succeed Is to
make money. I do not blame the
young for being attacked by It, when
I note how the older and \u25a0 supposedly
saner among our best -classes welcome
it so warmly.: ' :

consequence was feeling at enmity with
all the world, but with his father in par
ticular. When he came to say his pray
ers at night he gabbled through them at
a high rate of speed and while asking
for the customary blessing on all the
other members of the family, including
the cat, he left out his offending parent.
His mother understood, but thougâ it

about papa? You forgot, dear."
"Didn't. Don't want papa blessed."
"Why, Harold! when you love him so?
Just think, dear, papa has gone down
town now and how would you feel if he
got lost or hurt because you hadn't
prayed for him?"
This rather worked on the boy's mind,
and slowly he began to clamber out of
bed, when, just as he got on his knees,
he heard the familiar click of his father's
key in the lock. "I guess I'll risk It." he
announced, and quick as a wink Jumped

for. It would be easier to get along
without cash than without kindness, I
think,- and I well . realize the neces

at life we should not be content to gaze
down the -deep holes of living; we
ought to climb to the hilltops, where
the air Is clear and invigorating, and
whence we can see beyond the little
walls that hem us In below.
We should always remember that we
are drawing our plans for eternity, and
that to-morrow the things of to-day
will be the things of yesterday.
The man who really wins out is the
man who has a desire to do something
that is useful and right, and who usea
all the power and mind he can com
mand in a real attempt to do this some
thing as well as he can; who realizes
that he is only one out of many mil
lions, every other one of whom has
certain rights and privileges in com
mon with him; who does not try to
block the way of others in order that
he may get ahead; who is too true to
be dishonest, even in little things, and
too fair to stoop to deception or
chicanery. He is the man who is not
discouraged by failure; who can take
orders as well aa give them; who
doesn't know it all, and has time to be
courteous to all who come his way. He
is the man who is not always preoc
cupied with a false idea that every one
is conspiring against him to rob him
of his rights and take from him the
just fruits of hig labor. He Is all this
and more, but this is enough.
And will all these things bring him
success?
Now that all depends on what your
own particular conception of success is.
If you think of it as a possession which
you win by honest effort, and which
none can take away from you, then he
is bound to win It. If you are still
blinded by the dollar mark, he may win
and he may. not. But. this latter is of
secondary Importance, no matter what
viewpoint you take. Men can be just
as happy on a little as they can on

much need only push a button and some

"OX THE LEVEL"
In the October "World's "Work M. Ck
Cunniff describes the unique personality
of New York's District Attorney to an ar
ticle, "Jerome: a Man." The following
Incident Is related:
A New York reporter once telephoned
to the proprietor of a gambling house
who had defied the law for years and
said, inquiringly:
"We have heard that you were raided
this evening. Is it true?"
"No, It isn't true," replied the gambler.
"Me run a gambling house! What. are
you giving us?"
"But our information came from the
District Attorney's office." objected the
leporter. .
"Oh, Jeroma told you. did he?" came
after a pause. "Well, if you got It from
Jerome It's straight. I was raided, and
you can take It from me, young feller,
that anything Jerome tells you is on the
levelâ l don't carÂ» what it is."
It Is just because the public, too. be
lieves this District . Attorney Jerome, of
New York, haa become a ur.qiue force for
good In our public life. He has told us
things that have made many a cuddled
delusion wriggle with discomfortâ the
Kansans that their prohibition law Is a
sham, cultivated New Yorkers that the
shames and evils of the city are "up
to them," college men that they shirk
their duty, public ofHcers that they com
promise with political corruption, reform
ers that they deceive themselves. -
"I believe." he said one day. "that
somehow for other, telling the truth is
better than lying, if only for the man
himself"; and then ho added, "besides,
you have the satisfaction of knowing that
you have announced what many other
people think and daren't say."

Supreme Court Denies Eight
to Keep Administrator
in Dunsinuir Will Case
WILL GO TO EQUITY
Attorneys for Actress Say
That Decision in Clark
Case Means Her Victory
The Supreme Court yesterday decided
that the order issued by Superior Judge
J V. Coffey appointing & special admin-
Utrttor. on the petition of Edna Wallace
Hopper, to take charge of the property
of Alexander Dtinsmuir. the deceased
California millionaire, wai wrong, and
approved the petition oÂ£ James Duru
zaulr, tUstributor of the estate, to pro
hibit the administrator from taking the
property out cf his hands. By this de
clÂ£ion Edna Wallace Hopper loses an im
portant point by which she hoped even
tually to have the dtad millionaire's will
broken on the ground of fraud and undue
influence.
Alexander Dunsmuir died in New York
ia 1Â»Â». He was a resident of San Fran
cisco end so stated in his last wilL James
Â£Kin*niuir. a brother, took the will to
British Columbia and there probated it.
1-a.ter a certitied copy wes brought to
Â£an Francisco and was probated by the
Superior Cour: as a foreign will. Mrs.
Â£en& Wallace Hopper, who is a step
<iauchter cf Alexander Dunsmuir. failed
to Question the legality of the pro
bating of the will during the year
which ?s allowed for such an ac
tion and not until four years later
CM she apply for an order vacating the
order to probate the will. She was grant
ed this order and on It Judge Coffer
â¢ppoirted the special administrator to
take the property from the hands of
James Dunsmuir. James Dunsmuir pe
titioned the Supreme Court to forbid
tfce administrator from taking charge of
vfce property and in this, action he was
yesterday upheld by the Supreme Court. 1
The decision of the Supreme Court was
concurred in by all except Chief Justice
Eeatty. It was written by Justice Lori-
K&n. Iv commenting upon the case the
court says:
In our cpis.!cs there can b* no doubt of the
correctness cf p*lliioc*rs'Â« position, tnd thai
It devolve* upon this court to determine
Â«hrther or not the order annulling the order
admitting the will of Alexander Dunsrnulr to
probate was or was not void.
This brings v* to the controlling inquiry In
the eas*. \u2666â¢fcich 1* whether the order admitting
the will of A. Our.Ec-.uir to probate Lv the
Superior Court of the city and county of fciaa

its nature an attempt to declare void a cecree
la no sense void: that the attempt to do so ts

It follow*, then, that as the order vacating
the order admitting the will to probate is void,
the order appointing the spÂ»ciaJ administrator

DECISION IN" CLARK WILI~
In line with the Dur.smuir decision was
the decision in the estate of Julius H.
Clark, C. P. Duuoise appellant, and on
the result of this case the attorneys who
are re-presenting Edna Wallace Hopper
end her stepmother in their attempt
to break .the will of Alexander Duns
muir will bring an action in equity to
have the will set aside.
Julius H. Clark was a resident of Yolo
County. California, and while visiting in
Ketne, New Hampshire, he executed his
last will. The will was filed in Yolo
County, but before it tvas piobated per
mission was granted for Its removal to
New Hampshire, where it was probated.
The appellant then filed a petition In
Yolo County asking that the vrill of Clark
be probated there as a foreign will upon
presentation of a certified copy of the
New Hampshire probating. The lower
court denied the petition and decided that
t:ie will must be admitted as a domestic
will. This decision is upheld by the Su
i?:ein<9 Court in Its opinion of yestercfty.
The judgment was divided. Justices Hen
t ..v. Beatty, Lorigan and Angellotti
efflrziiiris and Justices Shaw, Van Dyke
and McKarland dissenting. The court
comments as follows:
. la summing up we thl&k tbe unhampered
jurist would reach the conclusion that our
laws not oniy recognised but preserved the dis
tinction between foreign and domestic wills
Â«nd the probate thereof; that the law Â«ay*
that all domestic wills' must be proved to the
county cf whJch the decedent was a resident
et the time -of bis death, for thus the State
j-reservts IU aovereifcnty and Its jurisdiction
over natters primarily belonging to it. That
:r. th* case of a foreign will this State has
less concern with the** questions of fraud, un
Â£uÂ« influence and the like, and upon the offer
cf proof of such a fj>reirn will It may be
\u25a0 fimitted upon the evidence proscribed in sec
tion 1324, \u25a0"\u25a0lthout right of contest along snch
matters. But -when a foreign will is bo of
fered for probate in this State two questions
ere cpeaed a* new aod original Questions for
the dÂ«-ternrfr.ation of our own Probate Court:
First, the safflclency cX the proofs of foreign
j.rob*te and. second, the question of the resl
cence of the deceased.

TEAR UP RAILS
IN LOS ANGELES
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 12. â Under the
personal supervision of Mayor McAleer
and in the presence of 1000 spectators,
a force of city workmen this after
noon cut the trolley wires of the Los
Angeles Railway Company and com
menced tearing up the tracks of the
company on South* Park avenue. The
action of the city authorities followed
the decision of Judge York to-day dis
solving vthe injunction restraining the
city from removing the railway tracks,
which the city claims were completed
after the time limit of the franchise
had expired.
About a mile of the track of this
division of the company's line comes
under the court's order, and the entire
line of 21.2 miles in length is affected
by the decision. About 10,000 people,
it" is estimated, are patrons of this
branch of the road. The company will
make no resistance to the city's work
in destroying the property. The offi
cials say that the people residing in
the section affected will suffer more
inconvenience Â».ian the company.
The Mayor was accompanied to-day
by City Attorney Mathews and a squad
of policemen. City Electrician Mana
han personally directed the cutting of
the trolleys. A hook and ladder com
pany was brought to the scene with
its apparatus and the electricians as
cended the ladders and cut the wires.
The trolley was cut at both ends of
the section of the street affected by
the court's order.
Several cars loaded with passengers
were on the line which was put out
of business by the city's workmen.
The passengers were transferred to
other lines and the cars allowed to re
turn to the company's barns. Four
rails at each end of the South Park line
were torn up and to-night a force of
policemen Is guarding the road to pre
vent the company from repairing the
line.

Dunsmuir to probate could not be set aside by
collateral attack, and the plaintiff roust seek
relief from the equitable side of tbe court.
The will of Alexander Dunsmuir was originaly
admitted to probate In British Columbia and
subsequently admitted !n California. A mo
tion was made by tbe attorney* for MrÂ«-.Hop
oer to *et aside the order admitting it In Cali
fornia on tfce rround that it was void upon
iv face, and therefore tbe subject oft a .col
lateral attack. Alexander Dunsmuir being a
resident cf California, hla will should have
been offered here criminally for probate.
The Supreme Court had decided that the
order waa not void upon its fnce. and the time
for appeal Jhavlcg expired, the plaintiff* only
remedy was In a separate action to vacate the
luSrment. However. thÂ« principle laid down
In Clark v*. Duboi*e *upj)orts the . contention
that the will cf Alexander Dansmulr should
first have b*en i<robatÂ«^ in the State of Cali
fornia, and under this decision an action will
immediately be commenced to. vacate the orig
inal order admitting the will to probate.
The conclusions are thai -1n the Dunsmulr
case the court holds the order admitting the
will to probate was nouvoid upon ltÂ» face and
therefore vÂ» not the ettbjec* of collateral at
tack* that the plaintiffs remedy waÂ» by
separate action to vacat* the Judgment ad
mlttlnK Â«nch will to probate, and they do not
Ji-me, the eneetlon Involved as to the place of
orisTiSl Jurisdiction. Simply that the plaintiff
has mistaken her remedy. Al*o, If the princi
r>krÂ» laid down In the case of Clark vs. Du
bci% are to obtain, the court In a separate
action Instituted for that purpose must vÂ«fat*
the orlsrln*l Judgment admitting , the will to
Probate: In ether words. If the case of Clark
vs Dubolse, decided by the Supreme Court to
<S*'r. stands. Mrs. Hopper Is cure to w^n.

EXHIBIT WINS
A GOLD MEDAL
Portland Exposition Gives
.Honors to the California
Board of Trade Display
TO EE PUT ON MOLE
Collection Will Be Estab
lished Permanently Where
Travelers May View It
The California State Board of Trade
was notified yesterday, through a letter
addressed to Manager Arthur R. Briggs,
that the exhibit made by the board at
the Portland Exposition had been award
ed a gold medal and special mention as
a whole. This exhibit was in the Agri
culture building. It included a large as
sortment of California orchard and field
products. Conspicuous in the show is a
collection of processed fruits, prepared by
the board's force of experts.
Attention was devoted to having the
exhibits shown properly. George A. Den
nison, secretary of the California
\u25a0World's Fair Commission, and Harry
Wight, both of whom are connected with
the State Board of Trade, took part in
the installation. Their efforts produced
a fine effect.
Early iv the present week It was re
ported at a meeting of the Board of
Trade that the Southern Pacific Com
pany wished to utilize tbe board exhibit,
which has since proved to be a high prize
winner, as a permanent show to be placed
in the ferry building at the Oakland
mole to exemplify the possibilities of
California production. This was agree
able to the members of the board and
they instructed Manager Briggs to co
operate with the Southern Pacific Com
\u25a0 pany in the matter. The show at Port
land is about to end. Tbe Board of
.Trade show will therefore probably be on
exhibition at the Oakla&d mole" in a few
\u25a0weeks. Harry Wight has gone to Port
land to attend to the proper handling
and shipping of the exhibit at the break
ing up of the exposition.
Official notice has been received
by the Bulls Head Oil Works that a
gold medal has been awarded to tho
works by the Portland exposition man
agement for refined oils.

SCHOOL BOARD DISPLEASED.^
WITH XEW BUILDING PLAN'
Deplores Elimination of , Fire-Proof
Construction In Washington
Grammar Building.
The Board of Education yesterday
expressed its dissatisfaction with the
reduced plans of" the new Washington
Grammar School building as submitted
by the City Architect. The plans had
to be revised because there Is only
$119,000 available and the lowest bid
previously received was $215,000. The
board deplored the fact that much of
the tire-proof material and the heating
and ventilating plant had been elimi
nated in order to reduce the cost.
City Architect Shea explained the new
plans and action was postponed until
Saturday morning, -when the plans of
the new Laguna Honda and Sunnyside
schools, to cost respectively $54,060 and
$Sl.OOO, will also come up for approval.
The board accepted the resignations
of William C. Wood and Lillian V.
Clarkson, teachers in the department.

F. Ringrwalda were elected members of
the evening school department and as
signed to the Hancock School.

CALLS COUSIN A LIAU
.VXD COURT FIXES HIM
I-'. Jacobs Commits Contempt of Court
and Judge Gruhaiu Sur
prises Him.
E. Jacobs, a recent arrival from New
York, was fined $20 for contempt of
court by Judge Graham yesterday. Be
coming excited when he believed things
were going against him in his suit to
recover J75 wages from his cousin, *D.
Hecht, he called the latter a liar, with
the result that Judge Graham adjudged
him guilty of contempt and fined him
$20. in default of which he was to go
to jail for twenty-four hours.
"Well, that's just $20 more this
speculation has cost me," said Jacobs,
"but it's better than spending twenty
four days' ln jail."
"The court only said twenty-four
hours," said a bystander.
"Did he?" anxiously inquired Jacobs.
"If I had heard him I would have saved
my $20, but I guess it's too late now."
And It was.
Jacobs claims that his cousin brought
him out from New York, promising to
pay him $15 a week, but is now in ar
rears to the extent of $75. Jacobs fur
ther claimed on tbe stand that he did
much work for Hecht In New York be
fore he started West. Hecht denied
this statement, whereupon Jacobs called
him a liar. Judge Graham did the rest.
The case was taken under advisement.
Claims She Was JUted.
Rosa Elman, a resident of the Mis
sion, filed suit yesterday against Al
bert Feldman, an employe of tho Union
Iron Works, to recover $10,000 dam
ages for, alleged breach of promise.
Miss Elman alleges that she, accepted
Feldmfn's proposal of marriage in the
romantic month of June, it being
agreed . hetwepn them that the cere
mony should be performed In Septem
ber. That month came and passed,
however, and then, says Miss Elman,
Feldman told her that, he had ceased
to care for her and had made up his
mind not to claim her as his bridb. The
suit is the result of his alleged faith
lessness.

ARCHBISHOP OmCLITES
Large Gathering Listens to
a Solemn Seiinon by the
Eev. Father P. E. Mulligan
The Knights of Columbus in large
number attended St. Mary's Cathedral
last evening to join In the solemn ob
servance of Columbus 1 day. " ,
Pontifical vespers were celebrated by
Archbishop Montgomery and the ser
mon was preached by the Rev. Father
Mulligan, pagtor of St. Joseph's Church,
who said in part:
ThlÂ« is a memorable anniversary, .which re
calls to us what the church has bsen In the
history 1 and development of this American
continent.
It was Catholic genius that conceived the
idea of a land beyond the seas; it was Catholic
generosity which encouraged the enterprise
and bounteously gayÂ« the means to make it
a success. With the aid or Queen Isabella
Columbus set sail from PaJos. He invoked the
blessing of heaven upon bÂ«Â» dangerous enter
prise: hÂ« began his journey in the name or
Christ.
Every evening during those days of anxiouf
and doubtful wandering over the trackless
ocean he assembled bis men to stag the
Salve Reglna In honor of the Queen of Heaven.
His first act on reaching the new world
was an act of thanksgiving . to thÂ« Almighty;
the land was blessed and ~ named for the
savior of men. The first fruits of his voyage
were dedicated to the service of God and the
Catholic church, for -there Is still preserved in
the treasury of the cathedral of Eaville a
chalice made of the first gold taken to Europe
by Columbus. ' ' - . !
You Knights of Columbus are the Inheritors
of Um>s# treasures of the past. To you has
been given the same faith which Inspired the
great Columbus. You will be Knights of Co
lumbus not -in name . only but In your lives
of Catholic faith and Catholic virtue.

PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 12.â 1t was
all New York to-day in the tnird game
for the baseball championship of the
world between the National League
champions and the American League
pennant-winners. The visitors scored
nine runs, while the home team failed
to tally. The series now stands 2 to 1
in favor of New York.
Alatthcwson pitched another mag
nificent game, the Philadelphians hit
ting him for only four singles â the
â¢ame number of hits they made off him
Monday. Only one home player
reached second base. Coakley. the for
mer Holy Cross College pitcher, re-,
ceived poor support, - the American
Leaguers putting up one of the worst
exhibitions of fielding they have been
guilty of this year on the home
grounds. Murphy was the chief of
fender. He fumbled three grounders at
critical moments and Hartzell dropped
a fly ball. The usual good headwork
of the home players was missing. New
York played an easy game.
New York started off with a rush in
the first inning. Bresnahan was - hit
by a pitched ball. Browne fouled out
to Lave Cross, who held Bresnahan on
first. Donlin singled, Bresnahan go
ing to third. McGann also singled, on
which Donlin moved to third, while
Bresnahan scored the first run. Then
Murphy fumbled Mertes" grounder, al
lowing Donlin to score. Dahlen waited
for four balls, filling the bases. Devlin
chopped a grounder to Coakley, who
threw McGann out at the plate, and
Schreck made a quick throw to first,
heading off jJevlln, completing a double
play.
GIANTS SCORE FIVE RL'-VS.
Excepting a muff by Hartzell of Me-
Gann's fly in the third inning, the New
Yorker 6 went out in order in the sec
ond, third and fourth innings. The
fifth inning was'a distressing affair for
the home rooters. Matthewson went
out on an easy grounder to M. Cross.
Bresnahan was given a base on balls.
Murphy fumbled Browne's grounder,
Bresnahan going to third, and Browne
took second on the throw to catch
Bresnahan at third. Donlin was pur
posfcly given four balls, filling the
Then Murphy fumbled McGann'i easy
grounder, Brcsnahan scoring. A single
by Mertes to right sent Browne home.
Dahlen forced Mertes at second, on
which play Donlin scored and a mo
ment later Dahlen stole second while
Coakley held the ball. McGann scored
the fourth run of the inning on Dev
lin's single, Dahlen going to third. The
Phlhidelphlans' signals went wrong, as
Devlin stole second and Dahlen slid
across the plate with the fifth run.
Gilbert, the ninth man up in the in
ning, sent a fly to Lord.
Powers relieved Schreck behind the
bat In the sixth Inning and in the sev
enth he threw two men out who tried
to steal second. Not a New Yorker got
to second base after the fifth until the
ninth, when, with two out, Browne
singled and stole second. Donlin got
a. base on balls and both runners
worked a double steal.
Powers made a good . throw to M.
Cross, who dropped the ball and
Browne was safe. McGann sent both
men home with a two-base hit. and a
moment later the New York captain
was caught napping at second by a
fine throw by Powers.
MATTHEWSOY THE WHOLE SHOW.
Of the thirty-two men who faced
Matthewson nine reached first. Hart
zell. the first man up in the first in
ning, was safe on Devlin's fumble of
his grounder. He stole second and
was caught between the bases on Da

first In the second on Matthewson's
only base on balls and was forced out.
In the second M. Cross singled and
\u25a0was left at first. In the seventh Davis
singled and was thrown out going to
â¢econd after a foul fly had been cap
tured. Seybold singled in the same
Inning and never got away from first
base. In the eighth Coakley was hit
by a pitched ball after two were out

HOLMAN WILL
LEAD BABIES
Stanford Freshmen Choose
Portland Man to Captain
Team Against Berkeley
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 12.â
J. R. Holman. a graduate of the Port
land High School, was to-night elected
by the freshman team to lead them in
the Intercollegiate contest on Saturday
against Berkeley. The new captain
has heon at the quarterback position In
all of tho games? of the season, and it
is attributed to his headwork and en
courapement of the men that the car
dinal ponies have been so fortunate in
thf-Ir preliminary uames.
is the third man to hail
front the Portland HiKh School who has
made good. When the promising
quarter first appeared on the field for
practice and by his knowledge of the
game attracted the attention of the
coaches and rooters the question was
asked. "Who is he and where docs he
register from?" When the query was
ant-wered and it was learned the can
didate was a Webfooter and from the
same Institution^ that graduated
"Stump 1 Stoot, quarterback captain of
1907. and "Kenny" Fenton, the quarter
who won the contest single handed
from California last year, it was gener
ally predicted that the freshman, had
all the chance in the world to win and
that they would be led to battle by the
"Portland" qunrter. It is now rumored
that a man with quarterback abilities
is already chafing at the restraining au
thorities of the famous northern high
school and will enter Stanford next
year.
Holman is n member of the Zeta Phsl
fraternity, and Is registered in the en
gineering department. He is of the
average height, and is especially con
spicuous on the gridiron for his abil
ity to oarry the spheroid forward in a
scattered field many yards after he has
been tackled by the lirst opponent, be
ing able to "wriggle" through encircling
arms.
easy victim. With two out In the
ninth Captain L. Cross singled and
Seybold ended the game by striking
out. â¢"
The day was cold and raw for base
ball. The attendance was officially
announced at 10,991. the receipts $8348,
and the players' share $4507. The total
attendance of the three games is 53,938,
and the total receipts $40,072.
The teams will play In New York
to-morrow and Saturday. Plank and
Powers will be the Philadelphia bat
tery to-morrow.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1905;
MURRAY WINS
CHAMPIONSHIP
Defeats Jack ZtlcLaughlin at
Boxing Show Given by the
Occidental Athletic Club
The Occidental Athletic Club's flstic
soiree drew -a three-quarter size audience
to Woodward's Pavilion last night arid
Manager Sam Berger had hl3 troubles.
President William Greer 'Harrison of the
Olympic Club questioned the standing of
the Occidental Club, refusing to sanction
the appearance, of any Olympians under
penalty of expulsion. Under such condi
tions Frank Flores refused to meet Jim
Bradley in the 135 pound class and Jim
McClair declined the bout with champion
Jack McLaughlln. the middleweight
Some very good sport was furnished
and while the show was a trifle slow in
getting under way, thereafter no fault
whatever could be found with the man
agement. Philadelphia Jack O'Brien was
introduced by Jerry Murnane and he re
ceived a warm welcome.
Champion Jack Mclaughlin had to play
second fiddle to George Murray in the
event of the evening, Referee Phil Wand
and the Judges. Buddy Ryan * and Fred
Garrett, deciding in favor of the latter at
the expiration of the four rounds. Mur
ray was substituted for McClair and
rushed matters from the outset. ' Mc-
Laughlin, a $10 to $3 favorite, seemed in
clined to slug and wrestle, which tactics
cost him the verdict.
In the curtain raiacr, Jimmy Carroll
and Eddie Lenny mixed it, the former
scoring on points. Then Mike Kutcho3,
the untamed Greek, and Frank Baronl
from Sunny Italy, both 110 pounders ac
cording to the menu, waded through four
troubksome rounds. Baroni won, causing
some dissension. Both agreed, however,
to sail on a fishing smack and all is well.
Joe Kelly "of the Occidental Club fol
lowed by outpointing Jack Doyle, another
125 pounder from Point Lobos. Willie
Conroy, who claimed to weigh but 118 took
Frank Flores' place and earned the de
cision. over Jim Bradley, 130 pounds. The
latter had style and confidence, but was
deficient in execution and aggressiveness.
A big favorite, Jim Kane, registered as
from Cow Hollow, had his wind bag
punctured by Jim Ford In the third round
of their bout. Each tipped the scales, at
130 pounds and a left hander accomplished
the trick. Kane got his second wind
when too late.
Two bantams, Harry Baker and Harry
Williams, followed. Williams posseses a
knockout drop in either glove but couldn't
find Baker's Jaw. In consequence he was
outpointed by the taller boy.

If the Seals can get away with all
games as they did yesterday, Uncle
will not have to hire any stickers, for
base hltÃ will be no more use in this
league. The story of the ninth spasm
sounds like a tale from fairyland, but
it was truth nevertheless, though no
, fan would believe It unless the score
were shown him. Six men walked In
that period' and four runs came â¢ in
without the aid of a hit and thus ended
a game. that looked in for Seattle every
inch of the way till the last round.
The Siwashes were leading 3 to 0
when the ninth hoVe In sight. All the
fans were making- their getaway,
for their hopes were already gone.
But OÂ»car i Jones, who used to bask
in the smiles of the Brooklyn fans,
began to get the jimmies at this
particular stage of the game, for, after
pitching great ball for eight in
nings, he deliberately turned around
and passed Gochnauer, Waldron and
Spencer In a row.
The fans set up a howl that could
be heard many blocks away. Every
one knew that something was coming
off and the tone did not change in the
least when Manager Hall chased Jones
off the slab and called upon Charley
Hall to come to the rescue.
But he was not a whit better than
his predecessor. The first rattle out of
the box he booted a little grounder
from Waldron's bat. allowing Goch
nauer to register the first run.
Then he passed Mohler and Hilde
brand and tied up the score. The fans
were in a frenzy by this time and Hall
began to fade away. However, he
managed to strike Nealon out and
Householder forced Waldron at the
plate, making the second down. Hall
had a chance to pull himself out of the
hole at this stage, yet he issued an
other pass to Irwin and tossed the
game off to the Seals.
It was too bad to see the contest
end the way it did. .Tho Siwashes de
served to win, for they played the
game all the time, "while the Seals
acted like a flock of buuhers. Jones
was hit hard at tlmeÃ, but he had the
Indian sign on the Seals when they
needed a hit and up to the eighth had
them blanked with nine safe drives.
In the meantime Seattle managed to
get to Hltt when they were in need of
runs. During the fourth they walloped
him for fair and put two over. A pass
a steal and another hit In the fifth
allowed another to score and from that
time on they were riding eatjy till the
big blow-up came off in the last period

he will conquer the animal that he has

ANOTHER TIE
AT BERKELEY
California Fails to Score
Against Football Elevtu
From Oregon University
CONTEST IS EXCITING
Webfooters Show Fine Team
Work, but Opponents Are
Too Strong to Be Beaten
The California and University of OtÂ»
gon football teams played a tie game on
the Berkeley gridiron yesterday. The
score should have been two touchdowns
strong in favor of the home eleven, but an
offside play spoiled one chance and a
fumble the other. The visitors cama
close to scoring a field goal and winning
the contest four minutes before thÂ© end
of the last half. r "
The game was replete with sensational
plays and It looked like anybody's victory
after the Intermission. During the first
half California outclassed the youths from
the wet country, but tha Blue and Gold
supporters grew careless. Off3ide play
and fumbling were frequent on the part
of both elevens.
The Northerners played a great game.
Save for their offenses against the rules,
they could hardly have done better. Their
interference was splendid, they tackled
well and every member of the outfit got
into the play. Moullen, well known in San
Francisco, saved his team from beta*
beaten by hla punting on two different oc
casions. Besides that he came close to
winning a victory on a place kick. Moores
on left end made three runs of twenty
yards or better around- California's left
end.
BERKELEY 3IUCH IMPROVED.
Line plays did not prove profitable for
the visitors and when they were tried a
punt was forced or the Blue and Gold
secured the ball. Friessell. who played
so well for Nevada tn other years, was
somewhat of a failure. He never gained
his distance but once during the gama
and wag often downed for a loss. When
Oregon tackles Stanford next Tuesday,
the public will begin to be able to get a
line on the two big teams from this State.
In yesterday's game the players for
the Blue and Gold were Inexcusably
careless In handling the ball. ThÂ«
ground was dry and no one had
greased the pigskin. Offsfde plays
came too frequently to be forgiven.
Force. Kittrelle and Snedlgar \tpn
most of the honors for the team. CaÃ
fornia got the ball to within fifteen
yards of the Oregon's Hn*> ten minutes
after the start and then lost it on
downs. Shortly afterward the Blue
and Gold players carried the pigskin to
within ten yards of their opponents'
goal, but were set back five yards for
an offside play. A few moments later
the ball was again six yards from a
touchdown and was fumbled for a loss
which could not be made up.
OREGON KICKS DOWN FIELD.
Oregon managed to kick down the
field out of the danger zone and the
half ended with the ball in California's
possession on her own fifteen-yard line.
In the second half, the teams seemed
to be pretty ' evenly matched as a re
sult of substitutions made by Coach
Knibbs. The only time there was real
danger of scoring was when Moullen
tried for his _roal from the field from
the thirty-yard line.
On the whole the California team is
progressing splendidly. however. It
may not be as strong as the Cardinal
outfit of last year at the opening of the
big game, but it will know more mod
ern football and show as much speed.
The weather was "fine for football
yesterday and the big crowd In attend
ance enjoyed the contest Immensely.
Pette Smith was an Ideal referee. Ha
refuses to stand for any argument and
hurries the game along In the proper
way. The managers could not get a

MarQiiefteLINERS TAKE MANY PASSENGERS
Sonoma and Korea
Start Across
Pacific
Insurance Man Is
Almost Carried
to Sea.
The liner Sonoma, for the Antipodes,
and the Korea, for the Orient, took
their departure yesterday afternoon
and tach carried a large number of
passengers. Amonfr thosÂ« on the So
noma were the passengers who started
for Honolulu September 30 <jn the Ala
meda.
The Sonoma carried more than 360
passengers and among those for Aus
tralia were many wool buyers. The
Korea was crowded to her full capa
city, having 202 cabin passengers, 375
Chinese and 100 Japanese.
C. F. Mullins, a local insurance man
furnishf-d the only excitement attend
ing the Korea's departure. He paid no
attention to the ail-ashore gop.;s,
whistles and bells and even Captain
Anderson's leather-lunged chant, "All
visitors ashore." failed to reach Mul
lins' ears. Ho was saying good-by to
somebody, and parting proved such
sweet sorrow that he lingered over his
farewells until after the gangway had
been hauled ashore and the lines cast
off.
\u25a0 Mullins reached The place where the
gangway had rested in time to see the
stretch of water between ship and
wharf widening far beyond the Jump
ing distance.
"Call your ship back. I am not a
riasseiiger. I want to get ashore."
cried Mullins to Alexander Center.
Center glared at him and resumed
his conversation with Wharf Superin
tendent Hnuxhurst.
Mullins appealed to Captain Wilson.
"Come back with the pilot. You have
ro business here," was all the com
fort the insurance man received in that
quarter.
Meanwhile the Korea was getting
farther from the wharf.
"Oh, officer, officer! 11 yelled Mullins.
addressing a Custom-house inspector.
"Will you take a message and tele
phone it for me?"
The inspector nodded.
As the Korea got farther from the
wharf Mullins had to shout louder and
by this time several thousand people
were all attention.
"Ring up West â "
Here the Korea's siren rilled the air
with a long blast.
Ring ur> West â "
Two whistles to some passing craft
again shut off the message and by this
time the distance was so great that
Mullins was turning black in the face
with the effort to make himself heard.
Then Mullins spotted a friend on the
wharf.
"Say, old man. ring up West 21. Tell
ray wife Ive â "
There was another whistle and Mul
lins gave it up.
But he did not have to depend upon
the pilot's hospitality. The tug Arabs
was hailed by Captain Seabury and
Mullins and a Pacific Mail stenograph
rr. who also had failed to read the
eigns of approaching departure, were
transferred to the towbOat and landed
on the wharf.
Captain Seabury's stay on his farm
has not affected his ability to plow
the sea_ The new wharves now pro
jecting beyond the old one have left
tho berth at which the Korea was ly
ing in a rather awkward sort of
rocket. Other _capta ins have had diffi
culty in getting their vessels away,
even with towboats to assist. Sea
bury, however, started the Korea at
full speed astern and the next bell he
sounded was the "full speed ahead,"
\u25a0when she was straightened out on her
course.

HIDDEN ROCKS
MENACE SHIPS
Professor Davidson Urges
Chamber to Make Appeal
to Congress for Action
TELLS OF DISASTEES
California Delegation to
Work for Appropriation
to Keniove All Perils
Taking the recent disaster to the
steamship Alameda and the loss of the
Rio de Janeiro as a text. Professor
George Davidson has urged upon the
Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco
that strong petitions shall be forwarded,
through the chamber, asking Congress to
remove each and every one of twenty
rocks that threaten shipping in the bay
and approaches to the bay of San Fran
cisco. The chamber, in response, has re
quested that the California delegation
and the representative of the chamber in
Washington shall try" to have an appro
priation made to insure the removal of
the rocks.
In 1596 Professor Davidson was chair
man of a . committee of the Chamber of
Commerce that made a report, after In
vestigation, concerning the rocks that
menace the vessels that move in and out
of the harbor of San Francisco. There
wert* found to have been 348 marine dis
asters at this port that were due to the
rocks and this number has been swelled
since to about 400.
Following the making of the report by
the committee. Professor Davidson was
askeS to have petitions to Congress
drawn to haye certain of the dangers re
moved. The result was that three rocks
have been demolished.
The report of the committee to which
Proftssor Davidson referred in his com
munication to the Chamber of Commerce
sets forth that some of the dangers at
tending navigation are as follows:
No amount of care on the part of masters
or pilots can prevent vessels from striking
these rocks. Indeed, it will be seen by the
list of disasters accompanying this report that
a large number of the vessels damaged had
pilots aboard. The reason for this helpless
ness of pilots to save vessels from these rocks
13 found In the peculiarly thick fogs which
beset the entrance to this harbor and the
peculiarly uncertain but strong .currents which
continually sweep through the bay- and its
approaches.
In a thick fog the rocks cannot be seen
and the swift but silent currents carry a
vessel about in the most bewildering manner.
Steam craft and vessels in tow seem to have
a better chance to escape the dangers, but
even steam power has not been wholly effi
cacious as a study of the list of disasters
will disclose. To make the harbor safe during
foggy weather the removal of the rocks is
absolutely necessary.

JURY SPENDS
DAY ON WATER
Inspects Courses Taken by
Oceanic and City of Ches
ter When Latter Was Sunk
COUET HELD ON TUG
Judge, Hunt and Marine Ex
pert s^ Accompany 3len Who
Are to Decide Damage Suit
The Jury in the ease of Hampton and
others against the Occidental and Ori
ental Steamship Company spent yes
terday morning going over the courses
alleged to have been taken by the
steamships Oceanic and City of Chester
on the morning of their fatal collision,
August 22, ISSS. The suit for $100,000
damages brought by John/C. Hampton.
Mrs. Grace I. Tyson and Mrs. Ida Louise
Mauvals against the steamship com
pany for the death of their father, who
was a passenger on the 111-fated City
of Chester, has occupied the courts for
many years and was recently sent back
by the Supreme Court for a rehearing
in Judge Hunt's court.
The Pacific Mail Company's tug,
Arabs, left the Mission wharf at 9 a.
m. sharp, having on board Judge John
Hunt, the jury that is trying the case,
Ambrose Watson, clerk of the court;
Captain Freeman of the Pilot Commis
sion and Captain G. E. Bridgett, who
were selected by both sides as expert
witnesses, and tho attorneys in the
case.
. The tug passed to the south side of
Presidio shoals and to Fort Point and
there the experts pointed out the place,
about 1000 yards from the old spar
buoy, where the Pacific Mail Company
declares the collision occurred. The
party then passed to the other side of
the Golden Gate to. Point Diablo and
re-entered the harbor on a northeast
course," supposed to have "been, taken
by the Oceanic. "When within a few
hundred yarda of Lime Point, the ex
perts again pointed out the place where
the Occidental and Oriental Company
claims the wreck occurred and where,
nearly eight years later. Captain
Whitelaw claimed to have located the
wreck.
The tuff then came in mtdchannel to
Mission-street wharf, where Judge
Hunt excused the Jury until Monday
morning at 10 o'clock.
The City of Chester collided with the
Oceanic in the fog and sank a few min
utes later. The Oceanic rendered all
assistance possible, but many persons
perished with the doomed vessel. The
Oceanic then proceeded to Black" Point
and dropped anchor. Each captain
claimed that the other was out of his
course â that he should have been on
the, opposite side of the entrance, and
upon this claim is based the main point
of the suit.
In February, lS96..Captain Whitelaw,
the wrecker, swore he had located the
hull of the Chester in fifty fathoms of
water near Lime Point and said ha
could go there at any time and drop
a line upon the deck. The jury ac
cepted his offer to conduct it to the
spot and a tug was secured. The cap
tain took a line almost due north from
Fort Point and across line to the north
of east from Point Bonita and the spot
where these two bearings intersected
he pronouned the grave of the City of
Chester.
BIG APAHTMKXT HOUSE LEASE
INVOLVED IS LITIGATION"
Owner of the l,lndn Vlata Sum Lessee
Baker to Recover 915,000
Damages.
Though it has been open but a short
time, litigation involves the Linda Vista
apartment house, located at Turk and
Jones street. Isaac Liebes, owner of the
building, filed suit yesterday against
Henry E. Baker, lessee, and A. B.
Smith, who furnished the place, to re
cover $15,000 damages for breach of
contract.
Liebes alleges that he leased the
building to Baker at a monthly rental
of $1297, it being agreed that in event
any covenants of the contract should
be violated the lessee was to forfeit
$15,000, liquidated damages, and, to in
sure the payment of damages, was to
give Liebes a chattel mortgage on the
furnishings of the building.
Liebes now asserts that Baker has
failed to pay his rent for the last
months and that he refuses to exe
cute the chattel mortgage as agreed.
In consequence of these alleged
breaches of the contract Liebea says
he has been damaged to the extent of
$15,000, for which sum he asks judg
ment, with costs of suit.

INDICTED MAN
ENDS HIS LIFE
Armitage ; Mathews Leaps to
His Death From a Win
dow of His Apartments
PROMINENT IN POLITICS
New Yorker Accused of Loot
ing Estate Had Friendship
of Former Governor Black
NEW YORK, Oct. 12.â Rather that face
trial on the indictment charging him with
having fraudulently taken money from
the Wiessel estate, Armitage Mathews,
lawyer and secretary of the county Re
publican committee, committed suicide
by Jumping from a window in his apart
ments to a stone pavement in the court
yard. He struck on his head, fracturing
his skull and died In a short time.
Mathews, who was a young man, had
advance^ rapidiy, both in the practice of
his profession and in politics. He was a
friend of Former Governor Black and ot
Abraham Gruber and they were loyal to
him in his trouble, acting as legal ad
visers and doing . all they could to aid
him to- obtain the change of venue from
this county for which he had applied.
The change of venue was denied yester
day.
Mathews was indicted last May on
charges of conspiracy and grand larceny
growing out of the looting of the Welssel
estate, of which David Rothschild,
wrecker of the Federal bank, was admin
istrator.
Rothschild, John W. Wooten and Law
yer Samuel L. Ferguson were all indicted
with Mathews on the same charges.
Rothschild is now serving a long term
in State prison for wrecking the Federal
bank and Wooten was convicted in June
and sentenced to nine years and five
months in Sing Sing.
Wooten was kept in the Tombs aa a
possible important witness against
Mathews. Ferguson was also expected
to be a witness for the prosecution of
Mathews.
Mathews was the local representative
of the Bankers' Surety Company ot
Cleveland, which was on Rothschild's
bond for $400,000 as administrator of the
"Weissel estate. It was agreed by the four
accused men, according to the Indictment,
that Rothschild was to have sole posses
lion of the estate and that whatever
money he borrowed on it was to be
shared by his associates.
Mathews at one time was an assistant
District Attorney. He served three terms
as a member of .the Board of Aldermen.
Two years ago he was made secretary of
the county Republican- committee.
After Rothschild was convicted and sent
to Sing Sing he drew upon bits"bf a paper
a stries of statements in which he ac
cused Mathews of having a share in the
looting of the Welssel estate. Eventually
the statements reached District Attor
ney Jerome and Rothschild was brought
to New York to testify against Mathews.
SBNATOK LONG ADVOCATES
LOWEII l'Hlia-'PINE TARIFF
Confern With the President on Mut-
tcr.s Obx'tfrved on Trip to
the Far Knst.
"WASHINGTON. Oct. 12. â In the opin
ion of Senator Long of Kansas, who
made the trip to the Far East with Sec
retary Taft and party, the greatest
need of the Filipinos is freer trade with
the United States. The Senator talked
with the President to-day about the
needs of the Philippine Islands. He
told the President that in his judgment
the islands would be in serious financial
condition until a reduction of duties
on their, products entering the United
States was made.
"Recently," said the Senator, "the
Filipinos have suffered from the
typhoons and drought. As a conse
quence their crops have either failed
or been wiped out and they are becom
ing discontented. Their discontent does
not take a revolutionary form, but is
simply the result of existing condi
tions."
Senator Long discussed railroad rate
legislation with the President. He ex
pressed the belief that the matter
would be disposed of early In the ap
proaching session. .

HOCH ASSISTED
BY MILLIONAIRE
James H. McNieholas, a Kicn
Miner of Portland, Puts
Up Money to Appeal Case
WANTS NO -NOTORIETY
He Eeads of the Affair and
Then Goes to Aid of the
Murderer and Bigamist
CHICAGO. . Oct. Liâ A casual glanoe at
a newspaper by an entire stranger, who
happened to be spending a day in Cleve
land. Ohio, it has just been discovered,
is what intervened to save Johann Hoch,
the murderer and bigamist, from death
at a time when his execution seemed cer
tain. It has resulted in a postponement
until a thorough Inquiry can be made by
the Supreme Court of the State.
The man who, unsolicited, tendered his
check for the amount that would make
possible a stay of execution and an ap
peal to the Supreme Court, Is James H.
McNieholas, a millionaire miner with
headquarters at Portland, Ore.
According: to the statement made by
McNieholas during a visit to Chicago, he
was en route. last July to Hornellsville, N.
Y. At Cleveland he read the story of
Hoch's trial and the critical situation hÂ«
was in, with no money to assist him In
carrying his case to the higher courts
for review.
Hoch's condition made such an impres
sion upon McNieholas' mind that he was
unable to think of anything else. Finally
he learned the names of the attorneys
who were assisting in Hoch's defense and
that Representative Frank Comerford
was at Springfield seeking to secure a
stay of execution from Governor Charles
Deneen.
McNieholas Immediately wired Comer
ford that the sum necessary to guarantee
Hoch another trial would be forthcoming
on demand, and later wired the amount,
$500, to Comerford, thus saving Hoch at
the laqt moment.
Because of his dislike for notoriety
McNieholas' name has not been made
public before as Hoch's benefactor.
INDEPENDENCE OF
KOEEA NEARLY AT END
Hermit Kingdom's Affairs
Soon to Be Directed From
Tokio.
SEOUL. Korea. Oct. 12. â Japanese
Minister Hayashl started for Tokio to
day for the purpose of consulting the
Government and Elder Statesmen. Min
ister Hayashl recently recommended th
declaration of a Japanese protectorate
over Korea as the only means of mak
ing effectual Japanese projects In Ko
rea. It Is probable that the coming
conference will definitely decide the
political status of Kor>-a.
The Japanese are anxious to obtain
a firm hold on affairs before the return
of the representatives of Russia, and
the' impending conference, together
with the absence of the 'British and
Italian Ministers on a vacation, encour
ages the local Japanese to believe that
eventually all the foreign legations
will be withdrawn from Seoul, and
that the diplomatic business of Korea
will be handled altogether In Tokio.
The Wnipcror and court officials are
much worried over the present turn
of affairs, more especially as they
cling to their national representation
abroad and to the residence of foreign
Ministers In Seoul as the last vestige
of their vanishing independence.

Clews says American extraz'agance is making Money higher.
WHY SIOXEY IS HIGHER.
I'nbrldled Expenditure for Lnxnrles a
Prime Cause.
Tfce New York circular of Henry Clews
Â«ayÂ»:
"The current 6carcity of money Is by no
rr.tar> the sole result of the ordinary demand
lor rnovir.g the crops. T"hese demands are
necessarily lai-ger than usual because the crops
themselves are much above the average. But
the demand for money in mercantile channels,
r*fl(/ting the prosperity of the country â the
j>rejÂ«rations for increased bu*toesf to result
from this prosperity â represents a strain much
more laetir-g than the ordinarj- reasonable de
mand for crop funds. With" this prosperity
there has developed a corresponding season of
Â«xtravaganee, a seaeon of increased demand
for luxuries that in view of the extraordinary
c.err.aji(l!= for funds in the world's money mar
ket, of which New York has become euch an
Important component, will be quite sufficient
to maintain the value of money on a much
higher basis than has recently been the case.
The Imports of luxuries arc quite significant
In this direction, the monthly report of the
Appraiser of the port of New York, for in
etance, showing an increase of, in round num
bers. $5,000,000. made up in great part of
luxuries, in the Â«j>pari*ed value of importa
tions for the month of September. There wae,
for example, an increase of more than $1,000.
000 in the import value of precious stones;
119 automobiles were brought into the country
In September this year, as compared with 72
cars in the came month of 191*4; and from
January to September inclusive, 772 cars,
-valued at $3,UUU>UUU. wtr.- bruugnt in at tmt
port, in comparison with 435 in the came period
3*st year. In addition to this indication of
vnbrldled expenditure there are the demands
vi|K>n th-e world's market for peace fundsâ for
funds to aid recoveries by both J;-.;an and
Russia from the drains made by the war. Both
countries during the war resorted to loans from
their own peijple rather than assume risk of
injuring their foreign credits. These loans,
ior short terms, it is now thought advisable
to repay in order that the funds may find
*mjjlo}-ment in rf storing proper equilibrium In
domestic affaire after the losses of war. Rus
Â«ia has intimated a desire to borrow 6ome
thini? over $.">00.000,000 by the end of this
month, and Japan is likewise desirous of se
curing funds on a peace basis, allowing the
unexpended balances of her recent loans to con
stitute a reserve. In both instances these
r.ew .demands will become factors in the local
money market, even should New York not be
requested to officially participate in them, in
that they will require a further accumulation
of foreign funds, which will in turn mtan
additional handicaps upon the movement of
rold to ihi* center. In this connection the
rise to S per cent in the German Bank rate is
eigniflcant."

In lare* volume this mornlne under the con

Started the decline yesterday. The London
Â«tock market sÂ»--emed equally deiiressed with
JCew Tork over the significance of the opinlona
â¢xprespfcd in the bankers' . convention by Mr
Vanderllp. vice rtreeident of the National City
Bank. Lower urice.s for Americans were es
tablished there and Ixjndon began to sell
â¢ toekÂ« here as soon ac the market opened.
loafer the New York market became very
irregular, with oceasiona.l ralliee. But the
principal activity was while r'ricÂ«a were de
clining. The recoveries were due in large part
to the taking of profits by bearish traders who
had sold s-hort earlier, and there was no re
vival of active operations for an advance, ex
cept in the case or a few etooks, -which are
In the hands of speculative pools. The re
laxation of tins Â»=ellinÂ«r pressure was due in
part to the interpretation of eevcral incidents
it indicating a benevolent attitude towards
the market on the part of the powerful group

xvhlch 6O disturbed sentiment yesterday. For
Â©oe thi::g, the ftockg In which this group of
capltfclista is supposed to take a particular
Interest were Inclined to reeist the prevailing
depression. Amalgamated Copper amonpet the
industrial! enfl St. Paul amongst the railrocis
were the conspicuous examples. When - the
money rate opened at 0 per cent and fearjs
bepan to be felt that H would ripe above that,
practically unlimited amounts were offered at
that rate by the National City Bank. It was
Inferred from this that a corrective was de
â¢lgned, for the imrwession created In specu
lative circles by the paragraphs In the bank
era" addi-eea which was rr.ade raoÂ»t of by the
market yesterday. Speculation vu inclined
to take tfce ground that while a warning
fifalnet speculative exceÂ«js was intended, there
was no desire to convey a dintrust of the pres
ent level of rriceÂ». The motives of the trad-
Ing will b* seen, from these examples, to have
been largely inferential. The large arrivals of
g-old. amounting 10 $2,050,000 were consigned
to the bank which made the principal liana
en Â»the Stock Exchange. The time money
jnarket was called very firm or.d It was re
portefl that lender* were inclined to scrutinize
tnore closely as collateral some of the In

THE COPPER MARKET.
BOSTON. Oct. 12.â The warning which Mr.
Vanderhp gave yesterday seems to have bÂ«en
generally observed and trading to-day was
generally restricted all through the list.
There is no great pressure to sell, but on
the .other hand .buyers are â¢ cautious not to
extend themsUves until money gets easier.
The buying of Greene was very good toward
â¢the close, one houee taking several * thousand
pharos, with New York appearing as a seller.
The feeling is still bullish on Allouez and the
stock is scarce. North ButtÂ« is being steadily
liquidated, selling coming: first, from one house
and then from another.

\ew York Col ton Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. Vi. âCOTTONâ The de
cline in the market is partially attributed to a
cablegram received from Liverpool by ' Theo
dore Price &. Co., reporting an Important fail
ure in Calcutta, " indicating instability in the
Indian trade.
The Liverpool market was unaffected, pre
sumably because the news was near the close.
Trading was very active and. the bears are
very aKgrest;lve in their spot sales* claiming
that frosts have done no harm, and, If any
thing, have ben of benefit.
There were-, many disguised bulls who sold
out their holdings. A local firm was out with
an estimate of the crop, placing It at 11,600,-:
000 bales minimum. This also helped along
the decline. Tlie cry now seems to be that we
have a large surplus crop over from last year.

CHICAGO, Oct. 12.â The "wheat â¢ market
opened easy, with . the December op; 3uyi un
changed to &c lower at BtH4@Sti%c. . Almost
the sole factor of bearish tenor was rtHe .ab
sence of rain in the Northwest. Wit;Â» fcright
skies in that section the movement' dt the
new crop, which, on account of wet ;nreuthei.
had fallen on! considerably, is expocttd to
again assume large proportions. An advance
in the price of wheat at Liverpool hafi ap
parently little effect on the market here early
in the session. Rumors of drought In Aus
tralia were said to have caused the . strength
in the English market. Pit traders we re quite
free sellers here throughout the enti re day.
During the first hour a prominent con tmlssion
house' made offerings on a decidedijf .lower
scale. Under the combined pressure tlie price*
of December declined to Ss|s,c. On tioverlna
by shorts, however, the market later regained
temporarily all of the loss. : The action :qi
shorts was largely the result of advices tellinij
of active demand for cash wheat, both Vortji
west and Southwest. The foreign situation,
too. seemed to attract considerable attiintlon
at this stage of the trading. The rally cur
ried the price of December up to 88%@:{6!Â»;ic.
Prices however. Boon reacted again, the -ctoBL
being easy, with December at 8(5@86%c, a. losa
of ViÂ©%e. â¢ -
Sentiment in the corn pit was bearish,
mainly as a result of dry. frosty weat her
throughout the Middle West. The market
closed .fairly steady, December V&c lower at

Oats held comparatively ' firm. December

Butter, ClteeNe and KrcÂ«.
The Butter market continued bare yesterday
and stiff prices ruled in consequence. Some
houses were disposed to. get over ihe ' quota

conservative course, made no further advance.
The feeling was very strong, however.
Cheeee continues very firm.' â¢ Young Amer- :
leas arc higher, being In demand and scarce,
while flats are also well cleaned up : and strong.
The feeling in Eggs was also buoyant, stocks
of ranch bfing light and the demand good.
.while receipts continued to decrease.
This is a fine market for those houses -who
want to work off their Eastern and cold-stor
age" Butter and Eggs at a profit, and .they are
taking advantage of It.

Large boxes were In good supply, but gener
ally steady. All kinds of Wine Grapes moved
off well at the old quotations. The market
was still badly congested with Apples, and

with Captain Dowdell's version. Fol-.

port of the grounding:
At 11 a. m. we left pier No. 7 with Pilot
C. .R. Johnson on board. I backed the ship
out frcm th* wharf and straightened her up
alor.s the wharves. 1 "then told thÂ» pilot to
take her and steady her up to suit himself,
and he arswerort. "All rignt, captain," and
from .that time h; alone directed the course
of the *hip until she struck.
About halfway between Alcatraz, and LJme
Point a thick fog su in. I thought it was
only a bunch that would pass away. It par
tially cleared fcr a <ew .ee'.-onde. and we saw
high land on the starboard bow. .-but it got
thick again. I remarked to the pilot that we
ought to" hear Lime ' Point, -whistle. He an
swered yes, but we heard nothing. exospt .for
what I took for -a steam launch, as it was a"
sharp whistle on the starboard rlile. Shortly
afu-r thi<? . the pilot ordered the-, wheel to
starboard, but how much I do not know, as I
was on the starboard side of. the bridge, keeping
a lookout and listening for 'the foghorns and
other sieneJs. Hut 1 heard" him call out,
"Steady." A very -short time after'thls First
Officer P. ; Anderson from the forecastle head
sang out. "Fort Point right ahead, sir." and
at the same Instant th? pilot ordered the
wheel ha i-d aport.
WHISTLE SOUNDS TOO LATE.
I-went to the port side of the, bridge and
heard Ihe-whtatl* for the first time... Then the
vessel struck and the pilot order?*! 1 the engines
stopped. I thÂ»n took charge and founded dis
tress rtgnnls arxj ordered the boats swung out
and had the hi\g<* sounded.- lindlnj; the wells
-dry. \u25a0, I then sounded around ittfi - ship and
found three fathoms forward aÃd' three and
one-half amidship and four and one-half un
der the beam. I had all passengers trans
ferred to the steamer Golden Gate, which came
to our Assistance. .At high water 'we tried to
back off with our own engines,- but could not
move, later four tugs tried, but she would
not move then.
. Â»From the time we left the wharf until- the

was on the bridge in charge of the engine

also on the bridge from the time sho started
to the/time *he struck, but save no orders

ing yesterday Judge Kerrigan granted

that instead of his wife, Mary E. Pow
ers, Being given a divorce, ' he should
be granted such relief, together with a
judgment restoring to him his prop-,
erty, '.which he says, has been wicked
ly taken away from him.
Aided by her mother. Mrs. A. Sim- ,
mons, Powers says his wife, through
trickery and cajolery, caused him to

GIRL' WIFE TIRES
OF COUNTRY LIFE
Leaves Her Husband and Se
cures Decree Annulling /
Influenced by tales of the fascinations
of country life. Etta L. Woods left the
home of- her 1 sister In San Francisco, fled
to Hanford and there, on September 14,
1903 wedded Frank E. Condon, a prosper
ous young farmer. She was but 16 years
old at the time and as she matured " she
began to realize that she was not capable
of appreciating the beauties of a rural
existence and th^t life on the farm was
less romantic to her than she- supposed it
would be. So, after living a year with her
husband, which, she says, was a year of
constant quarreling, sha returned to her
sister Mrs. Josephine Martin, who was
appointed her guardian shdrtly before she
fled the city and whose consent to her
marriage: the girl wife did not obtain.
After hearing the girl't story. Mrs. Mar
tin Instituted suit to annul the marriage
of her sister, alleging that at the time
the - ceremony was performed Mrs. Con
don;was not of legal age and had not ob
tained the consent of the plaintiff. Judge
Graham heard- the : case . yesterday and
concluded . that the young woman's plea
would best be granted, and it was so or
dered.
"An example easy to be imitated in
its faults" is that of. a; store-advertiser
who uses a page of space on one day
and a quarter column on anotherâ

ing as^reat' on one day as the other,

GIVES DECISIOX^N FAVOR
;e?v;"Cy OF STATE OFFICIALS
Judge Si"arÂ» ell Hold* That Paper Con
tract A \u25a0warded to A. Zellerbach
* Son* Is Valid. - .;
An opinion was filed yesterday by
Judge Seawell denying the petition of
Bonestell, Richardson & Co. for an In
junction restraining Secretary of State
Curry, State Printer W. W. Shannon
anti\C. N. Post, constituting' the State
Printing Committee, from awarding a
contract^ for.; paper to be used In the
printing of school books to A. Zeller
bach & Sons. It was alleged by the
petitioners that the bid of Zellerbach &
Sons, which was accepted by the de
fendants in the suit, was for a brand
of paper Inferior to that provided for
in the specifications upon which the
advertisements for bids were based,
and that hence the award was illegal.
. Judge Seawell says that in his opin
ion the bid of A. Zellerbach & Sons'
together/with the award of the contract
them, constituted a valid agreement,
subject v to be defeated alone by the
failure of A. Zellerbach & Sons to file
a bond as .required by law. As the
plaintiff makes . no allegation .that- A.
Zellerbach â¢.&"â¢; Sons* failed to "file this
bond as required, .tfie court holds that
it may be assumed that" such bond was
filed. In consequence the, petition for
an injunction is denied. /
