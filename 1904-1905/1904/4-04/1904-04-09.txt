LOS ANGELES, April 8.â Captain
William Tornstrom, aged 63 years, is
mourning the loss of his wife. Alma
Tornstrom, aged 21 years, whom he
married in San Francisco not quite
one year ago. The skipper' does not
know whether she is drowned or has
deserted him. To the latter opinion
he inclines, for he says if she has
drowned herself he can't see why she
should have cared to take her pret
tiest Easter gown, in addition to the
one she was_ wearing, even though she
disappeared at 2. o'clock in the morn
ing from aboard the good ship Lud
low, of which heir husband is master.
While in San Francisco last summer
he met. pretty Alma Fried, who was
learning to be a nurse at the City and
County Hospital, but who was willing,
at his solicitation,, to .share the life of
the old seadog if he would only let
her finish her course as a nurse. This
the captain agreed to, so he and Alma
were married and she journeyed south
on board the Ludlow as his bride. Ar
riving here .she entered the County
Hospital in -Los Angeles. According
to statements made' by friends of the
captain she was fond ; of little dinners
at prominent" cafes in Los Angeles,
where liquid refreshments were' not
eliminated and where her ' escort was
not the 'master of the" good ship Lud

without a -break and without enough

than noticed. The real test of strength
between the Smoot, Sutherland and
Kearns forces will be at the conven

dodge the subject entirely.
SALT LAKE CITY, April 8.â The co
horts of Senator Reed Smoot won
handily at the Republican convention
to-day and named all six of the dele
gates to the national convention at Chi
cago. The victory was made less sig
nificant by the fact that the opposition
made no vigorous effort.
After quitting just before the pri
maries in Salt Lake convinced them
they would be beaten, the anti-Smoot
men attempted to secure a compro
mise in the interest of harmony. This
was in a fair way . to success for a
while, but the Smoot men refused to
be deprived of any part of the prize.
They squelched the antis so thorough
ly that on the counting of noses the
minority constituted only about 10 per
cent. :^. .
In this contest Senator Smoot had
the active aid of former Congressman
George Sutherland, while the opposi
tion was led by the friends of Senator
Thomas Kearns. Sutherland is desir
ous of succeeding Kearns In the Senate
next year. He is a Gentile and was
consequently able to bring some Gen

CHICAGO. April S.â The Hearst
people here are furious over the re
port that W. R. Hearst has given up
in the race for the Democratic nomi
nation for the Presidency. They are
denying it in letters a foot high.
The primaries here to-night re

men did not carry a single ward in
the city and all of the 118 delegates
selected to-night are Parker men and
will vote for the delegates pledged
to the New York Jurist in the State
convention.
Lawrence now says the message
was a cipher and dojes not mean what
it seems to. He says Hearst will start
a newspaper here in a month to make
a fight on National Committeeman
Tom Taggart and the State Demo
cratic organ supporting Parker.
The telegram to Lawrence was first
received by J. Oscar Henderson, local
manager for Indiana, and he uninten

sider, believing he was telephoning the
message back to the Western Union for
verification-.
Lawrence was here from Chicago
looking over the local situation prelim
inary to the primaries to-day to select
delegates to theState convention which
will pick delegates to the national con

the telegram Lawrence hurried back to
Chicago, leaving the Indiana managers
without aid.

"Let Mr. Harriman answer that

Judgment on that man or his motives.
I have nothing more to say."
"The courts will pass upon them."
said Hill, with eome impatience.. "I

ing the Northern Securities Company."
he continued. "We put together a cor
poration with a capital of $400,000,000.
Now that we are forced to take it
apart, we are fortunate in being able
to do so with an increase in the as
sets of the company of $40,000,000. The
total cost of making and maintaining
that property for two and a half years
was only $147,000. This is about three
hundredths of one per cent of the cap
italization. There is no room there for
a bis rake-off for promoters or offi
cers," concluded Hill, laughing. â¢
"Is Mr. Harriman's protest in the
courts against your plan for a division
of the assets of the Northern Securities
Company to be regarded as a friendly
suit?"

the time spent at the Chicago Club for
lunch, Mr. Hill was at the Burlington
headquarters all day conferring with
â¢officials of the Burlington system. He
is extremely bitter against Harrimau
and took no pains to conceal it.
Hill's face and manner, however, did
not indicate that he was worried over
the Northern Securities case â either
the decision of the Supreme Court or
E. H. Harriman's attempt to thwart
Hill's plan for dissolving it.
"In good faith and promptly we're
complying with the decree of the Su

Hill. "We are doing this, so our coun
sel advises, in a way both legally and
morally sound."

are given. Several correspondents at
Tokio and Seoul concur in saying that
Ihero has been no engagement.
The Russians have withdrawn across
the Tumen River as well as across the
Yalu. not opposing the Japanese ad
vance. According to the St. Peters
burg correspondent of the Standard
such a move would coincide with Gen
eral Kuropatkin's known plans and it
seems to be taken for granted in the
Russian capital that Korea has been
deliberately evacuated as part of the
commander In chief's strategy.
Fighting at the Yalu nnd a Russian
Reverse Rej>orted.
RUMORS OF A BATTLE.
"It is announced that the Russians
have occupied in force Fengwang
cheng. having only left some detach
ments as guards, from Antung to Kai
lieutin and above this point. It ap
pears therefore that the defense which
is being prepared there will not be
very serious, but it is certain that
General Kuroki is endeavoring to cross
the Yalue with his army to penetrate
Into Manchuria by the Peking road.
"We may be permitted to doubt
whether they have well counted the
difficulties of all kinds which are al
ready offered in Korea to the advance
of guns in the water-soaked roads.
The wagons which are bringing up all
kinds of supplies become mired every
instant. These guns, drawn by six
little horses of no great size or bulk,
only advance with despairing slow
ness. Now as Korea hardly produces
enough rice to feed its inhabitants, it
is necessary that the armies which are
operating there be followed by every
thing that is necessary for the sub
sistence of the men and animals. â¢
'There is also another consideration
of a nature to make General Kuroki
hesitate about taking the offensive by
entering directly the region where are
gathered almost all the Russian
forces. This is that such an attack
in front would only have a chance of
success by being prepared . through
previous or simultaneous movements
executed on the west or southwest of
the enemy's position."
"Thus becomes plain the plan of
General Kuropatkin, which consists in
gaining time and drawing toward him,
if it lends itself to this maneuver, the
Japanese army which is now deployed
from Pingyang to Anju and beyond.
PARIS. April 8. â The Herald's

Serious consideration will be given

Chinese Immigration. This is far more
drastic than the treaty.
No conclusion was reached at to
day's meeting. Secretary ! Cortelyou,
who has had the subject under con
sideration, was not present, having
gone to Philadelphia to attend a meet
ing of the American Academy of Po
litical and "Social Science.
â¢ The discussion to-day developed the
fact that the whole situation is cloud
ed in doubt. It is possible that Chi
na's denunciation of the treaty may be
withdrawn, but no official Intimation
of such action has been received by
this Government. The suggestion 13
made that another treaty may be ne
gotiated, but the terms of it are not
indicated beyond the fact that its ba
sis will be the existing treaty.
WASHINGTON, April 8,â Practically
the entire time occupied by the Cabi
net meeting to-day was consumed in
a thorough discussion of the Chinese
exclusion question. China has de
nounced the existing treaty, which will
expire by limitation next December. It
has been the hope, if not, indeed, the
expectation of China, to negotiate a
more favorable treaty than that which
is now in force, but an intimation has
been conveyed to the Chinese Govern
ment that it is improbable that a
treaty of a character more favorable to
the, Chinese than the existing one
could be ratified by Congress. r

BERLIN, April 8.â The Southwest
African correspondent of the Cologne
Gazette, Dr. Moellenhof. has sent his
paper 'a letter describing the relief of
Gmarura, February 4, from which It
app'ears that both sides fought with
desperate courage. When the garrison
of Omarura heard the firing of the ar
tillery of the relief corps, twenty of
the beleaguered force made a sortie
against the enemy, who held a natural
fortification consisting of a line of
cliff-like projecting rocks.
"The Hereros, attacked in front and
rear," says Dr. Moellenhof, "held their
ground with marvelous .tenacity. When
the" Germans rushed among them, many
Hereros crept into the crevices of the
rocks, where they were bayoneted.
Lieutenant von Koellewarth received a
mortal wound from a Herero twenty
paces distant and a German cavalry
man searching the rocks for wounded
was killed" at a few paces range. ,
"After being driven from this posi
tion, the Hereros took up a new one,
contesting every ; inch and leaving a
number of dead at every rallying
point. After the hottest firing was
over, the enemy '. fired at the German
wounded from bushes, " and the; : sur
geons dreBsed the wounds 'Â¦ while bul

BERLIN, April 8.â The influence of
forests upon climate was the subject of
discussion at the annual meeting of
the German Meteorological Society here
to-day. The conclusions reported as
signed much less influence to forests
than has been hitherto assumed. Pro
fessor Schubert of Goettingen gave a
summary of the results of his four
years' observations at Prussian sta
tions throughout the extended wooded
region .of the northern part. of Bran
denburg. Two observations were tak
en dally at numerous points within the
forests, in clearings and other points.
The result was that from the minimum
variations of temperature and humid
ity. In the forests and at more remote
points it was concluded that the for
ests had no appreciable influence upon
the rainfall and general climate. It
was pointed out in the debate follow
ing that observations In the ex
tended swamp regions of Russia gave
similar results. Diagrams and tables,
illustrating the above experiments, wili
be sent to the St. Louis Exposition.
' The principal speech of the evening
was made by John McNaught, who re
sponded to : Mayor Snyder's ; address of
welcome. For. several hours the visitors
remained at the Chamber of Commerce
building, most of the time being spent
in discussion* of subjects" of
Interest to the entire State and in the
exchange of views and experiences be

thence they will journey directly home.
LOS ANGELES, April 8.â After a
day crowded with events and sur
prises, sightseeing and welcomes, the
members, of the California Promotion
Committee sought their berths in their
special train at 12:30 o'clock to-night
and departed on their homeward Jour
ney. It was a day which those' with
the excursion will never forget; a day
in which they were shown the beau
ties of this end of the State in a man
ner which the tourist misses. Either
the entire body or portions of It saw
all that was to be seen in a hurried
trip through Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino and Los Angeles counties
and wherever they stopped they were
accorded a welcome which was new to
many of them and which was mani
festly sincere.
Unless the reception at various places
be styled as such, the day was devoid
of special incident. Of course there
was the fun which is always an accom
paniment of such trips, and the Jokes
perpetrated for the benefit of the crowd,
but the membera of the committee
came south particularly to see the
country/ and mark , its development.
What they saw / will be for the good of
the whole State, in that it will give
other sections the benefit of Jvhat has
been accomplished in this section.
The members of the committee awoke
at Santa Ana, where they were treated
to a speech by Superior Judge Ballard,
which they declared had the true ring
to it and which nearly all the members
of the committee remarked was one of
the best they had heard. \
They went to Riaerside and San Ber
nardino, and thence around the upper
loop of the kite-shaped track of the
Santa Fe to Los Angeles, stopping
awhile at Pasadena. The special train
bearing the committee and their guests
reached Los Angeles at 5 o'clock, and
without giving the visitors a chance
to rest the local committee had " auto
mobiles waiting, and those of the visi
tors who cared to go were taken for a
spin through the city..
' There was a reception at the Cham
ber of Comerce to-night, which was at

ber, of prominent Los Angeles men,
and responded to by members of the
committee.

There is little doubt that the ves

Without completing the postofflce bill
the Senate went into executive session
at 4:55 and adjourned at 5 p. m.
Scott expressed the opinion that It
was not right to attempt* to deprive
patentees of their rights tinder the
laws and also dwelt on the cost qf re
pairing the machines.
The amendment was lost, 18 to 36.
Teller called attention to the fact
that all the votes cast for the amend
ment to reduce the charges for the ma
chine, which charge he said the Fourth
Assistant Postmaster General had de
nounced as extortionate, had been cast
by Democrats, while all the negative
votes had been cast by Republicans.
He said the prices named in the bill
as It stood were the same as those
fixed by Beavers. He added that If the
Senate was trying to give Beavers a
bill of health it should go further and
Instruct the Department of Justice not
to prosecute him. The contracts, he
said, had been made in fraud, and
should be discontinued by the Sen
ate.
Lodge said that Teller was mistaken
and that the machine with which Bea
vers had been concerned was not now
under contract.
An amendment prohibiting the Post
master General from refusing to es
tablish rural free delivery routes on
account of the condition of the roads
was also accepted.
Clay quoted from a report denoun
cing the Beavers contract for canceling
machines and said that, notwithstand
ing this denunciation, the contracts
were continued.
WASHINGTON, April 8â The con
tract for canceling machines used by
the Postofflce Department was debated
at length in the Senate to-day in con
nection with the postofflce appropria
tion bill. Culberson introduced an
amendment reducing the rental of the
machines and the Democratic Sena
tors charged that the rental now paid
was the same paid under the contracts
made by George W. v Beavers when hi
was in the Salary and Allowance Divi
sion of the Postofflce Department and
that they were excessive. Lodge de
nied the charge, saying that there was
no truth in It. The postoffice bill was
still under consideration when the Sen
ute adjourned. The first hours of the
session were devoted to a discussion by
Patterson of the Chinese question in
which he maintained that the exclu
sion law was Ineffective after Decem
ber 7 unless there was additional legis
lation.
An amendment was adopted to re
quire postmasters to reside in the
town or city where they officially
serve.

pairing for the President's personal
use.
The Secretary details the use of the
Mayflower during the Spanish war at
length, and adds:
"She receives her orders from the
department in the same manner aÂ«
other vessels. In accordance with a
custom of long standing, however, a
.vessel cf the navy has been placed at
the disposal of the President from
time to lime as he may desire It. The
Jtfayfiower has been the vessel selected
tor this service under directions from
the President that at no time
chould she be diverted from any naval
duties for which she might be
tieeded."
WASHINGTON. April S. â Replying
to a criticism of the use of the naval
steam yacht Mayflower, filed in the
House for reproduction in the Con-
ETessional Record by Representative
Williams in the form of a newspaper
clipping. Representative Foss, chair
man of the Naval Affairs Committee,
to-day filed, also to be printed in the
Record, a letter from Secretary
Woody, giving a detailed history of the
use of the Mayflower X>y the President.
He says the Mayflower is not, as was
Btated in the criticism, "the Presi
dent's yacht."
Continuing, the Secretary says:
Two physicians left Fort Scott for
the scene on a handcar and following
them closely a wrecking train, bor
rowed from the Frisco Railway, start
ed for the wreck. The injured were
taken to Fort Scott. They are: W. C.

KANSAS CITY. Mo., April 8.âMis
souri, Kansas and Texas flier No. 6,
which left St. Louis last night for the
South, was wrecked four miles south
of Fort Scott, Kans., at: 4:30 o'clock
this morning by the rails spreading.
The engine left the track'first and fol
lowing it the baggage car and the mail
and express cars piled 'up. The smoker
and chair cars also were overturned
and badly damaged. " Many persons
were injured, but no one was killed. -Â¦
As soon as the first excitement fol
lowing .the wreck had subsided those
of the passengers and crew uninjured
set to work to aid the unfortunate, who
were laid beside the track until physi
cians arrived from E"ort Scott.
The Alaskan bill was then laid aside
and a bill was passed providing for
the cession of 120 acres of land in Yuma
County, Colorado, to the Beecher Isl
and Battle Memorial Association. A
joint resolution was passed providing
that the provisional act for the relief
of certain settlers on public lands shall
be construed to abolish the necessity
for proof in the cases mentioned in said
act.
The only State in which lynching had
been prevented by the swift and timely
interposition of the law was in Mis
sissippi, and this, he said, was due to
the personal acton of the Governor. â¢
Bowers made a comparison of the
criminal statistics of Massachusetts
and Mississippi, and said these showed
that the negro in the latter State was
six times better than those of Massa
chusetts. In Mississippi, he said, every
avenue of labor was open to the negro.
He pointed with pride, he said, to the
fact that in Jiis State the ratio of mu
latto to the colored population and to
the whole population was less to-day
than at any, time since the war.
Bowers asserted that the negro in
politics simply served parties and that
his political baptism was in the aid of
Republican ascendency. He believed
that race purity could be preserved
absolutely by the utter segregation of
the race in every scholastic relation.
The right of intermingling, he declared,
was fraught with peril. He said that
the negro was not fit for self-govern
ment, and he was greeted with Demo
cratic applause when he said the negro
should be eliminated as a political fac
tor.
WASHINGTON, April 8.â The House
to-day passed a large number of bills,
including the bill appropriating $470,000
in aid of the Lewis and Clark Centen
nial Exposition to be held in Portland,
Or., in 1905, and the Philippine shipping
bill.- The only amendment made was
one extending until July 1, 1906, the
time when the. law shall become opera
tive. The bill provides that no mer
chandise or passengers, except supplies
for the army or navy, shall be trans
ported by sea under penalty of for
feiture between the portB of the United
States and the Philippine archepelago
directly or bv way of a port err for
any part of the voyage in any except
vessels of the United States. It does
not prohibit, however, the sailing of any
foreign vessel between the United
States and the Philippines nor between
ports or places in the Philippines. The
tonnage taxes now in force on foreign
vessels coming into the United States
are levied on such vessels coming from
the Philippines. The Philippine Com
mission is authorized to Issue licenses
to engage in lighterage or other exclu
sively harbor vessels to vessels or craft
actually engaged in such business at
the date stated and to vessels or other
craft built in the Philippines or in the
United States and owned by citizens
of the United States or inhabitants of
the Philippines. The law does not im
pair or affect any privilege guaranteed
to Spanish ships and merchandise by
the Paris treaty of peace.
The House took up the bill to pro
vide for a delegate in Congress from
Alaska. In the debate which ensued
Bowers of Mississippi answered some
statements recently made by Gillett
regarding violation of statutes of Borne
of the States with respect to negro
suffrage. He declared that the negro
was as safe in the hands of the Gover
nor of Mississippi as in those of the
Governor of Massachusetts.

.Secretary Cortelyou spoke on "Some
Agencies for Extension of Our Domes
tic and Foreign Trade," and reviewed
at. some length the particular func
tions of the new Department of Com
merce and Labor. He said In part:
''Among the problems confronting
our 'people to-day, none are. more
worthy. of serious attention than those
relating to pommercial^ and Industrial
conditions. I believe ' that we are
making progress. I believe that there
is to tome better feeling between em
'ployerand employe. I believe that the
organizations and individuals j repre
senting the men and women of wealth
and the men and women whose toll
makes the. accumulation of wealth
possible are exercising an ever in
creasing influence of better feeling; and
your association and others of kindred
purposes, chambers of commerce,
boards of trade and commercial or
ganizations generallyâ great unofficial
agencies for the extension of American
commerceâ are doing much vital work
In that direction." ;â¢,-$?*.;Â¦.Â¦Â¦
PHILADELPHIA, April 8.â A con
vention of national importance, espe
cially to industrial interests,, began
here -to-day, â¢ the r occasion .being -..the
eighth annual meeting of the American
Academy of Political! and . Social , Sci
ence. ; Nearly all-great corporation In
terests were .represented. The chair
was occupied -by Frank A." Vanderlip,
-former Assistant -Secretary . of ;the
Treasury; '{Â¦ " . "
The subject under consideration dur
ing 'the "morning session was "The
Government in.'-Its Relation to Indus
try,"' which .was 'subdivided taken
up in detail: The first branch of -.the
topic was' "The v Government Regula
tion of Banks and Trust Companies,"
and addresses were delivered by Wil
liam-Barrett Ridgeley, Comptroller of
the Currency, who spoke on "The Con
trolof National Banks"; Frederick D.
Kilburne, New York State Superin
tendent of Banks, on "The Control of

. The. Ppmona. Public Library, already
distinguished for the excellence of the
plans on which it was constructed, will
soon be surrounded with floral beauty.
Besides a lawn. there will be rows and
hedges of roses supported by a seven
foot trellis work, which Is to hold the
Gold of. Ophir and Cherokee varieties.
These library grounds will in a short
time become one of. the most charm-,
ing spots In Pomona.
The library profession has met with
a loss by the . sudden death of Miss
Bessie F. Cooper, the of -Los
Gatos Public 'Library. Her. service, of
three years in that capacity wah 1 faith
ful and efficient and she had endeared
herself to patrons of .the .library by
her unfailing kindness and courtesy. ,
One ef the traveling libraries i sent
from the State Library has been re
ceived at Lompoc, .Santa Â»Â¦. Barbara
County. It is possible that the use
of this little library will lead to efforts
for the ; establishment of a public
library under the general law of the
State.
A library association has been formed
In Porterville, â¢ Tulare County, with the
view of interesting the public in the
establishment of a public library un
der the provisions of the State law.
In this cause the use of the travel-
Ing library just received from the State
Library will prove a great help. Por
terville is a prosperous town, has an
assessed valuation of nearly half a mil
lion dollars and a low tax rate.
The new. Carnegie building in Visalia
Is almost ready f ct public use. It is
tastefully finished in buff upon the in
terior side walls and has a light green
ceiling." Around the building will be
a handsome lawn and beds and clusters
of flowering plants. .Many of. the citi
zens of Visalia have stated their in
tention to give freely from their. own
libraries in order that the" new building
may have a goodly array of volumes
when It is opened.
The collection of Californiana is In
creasing. It now contains a number of
valuable books relating to early days
in California.
.The Vallejo public library, which
still occupies its old building, was re
cently badly damaged by a fire which
proved quite destructive in the city.
Every book In the library was injured
by smoke or water and many of them
will . require rebinding. The furniture
of the library was ruined. Insurance
policies of $2000 will probably cover the
loss.
A distinguished feature of Laton, a
* now town In the southern part of Fres
no County, Is Its early recognition of
the social and educational, advantages
of a public reading room and library.
Four years ago this place had no ex- ;
istence. To-day It has more than 300
inhabitants and there are 1700 settlers
in .the adjoining 'Lagtfna de Tache
Grant. In January, 1902, a small or
ganization of women secured "the use
of a room in the hotel and started a
reading room and library with three
books, a few old magazines and three
daily papers.- The new enterprise suc
cessfully passed the days of discour
agement and trial which seem insepar
able from such undertakings and soon
after were able to move into larger
quarters. These have been outgrown
and now the library Is to have a per
manent home of Its own. At a pub
lic meeting held a fewJweeks ago, Nares
Saunders, the manager of the Laguna
de Tache Grant, offered to give a cor
ner lot and to, erect upon it a $2000
library building.'
The strong work performed by the
Los Angeles Public Library, during the
last year Is shown by its recent report.
This covers the first year since the
adoption of the new city charter. One
of the provisions of this charter is not
able; there is no other. like it in Cali
fornia. It requires a minimum tax levy
of four cents on each one hundred dol
lars of taxable property in the city,
but it fixes no prohibitive maximum
rate. The tax has this year yielded
$43,964. The work of the library is now
done through the main library in the
city hall, six branches, four delivery
stations and four deposit stations. The
home circulation of books was 677,411,
a gain of 101,470 over the preceding year.
The total number of volumes in the li
brary is over 97,000, an Increase of 15,
656 in the twelve months.
There are 25,227 registered borrowers.
The reference department contains 23,
000 volumes. A number of complete
sets of valuable * magazines have re
cently been added. The fiction shelves
show an ownership of 18,777 volumes
and the active home circulation of 239,
000. , In the juvenile room may be found
18,000 works, including juvenile fiction,
with a home circulation of 81,225. .
In the little mountain town of Loyal- j
ton, Sierra County, with a population ;
of but a few hundred people, 175 books
have already been accumulated in its
town library. It is kept in the hotel
and is open every Saturday evening.
Any one who deposits a dollar may ob- |
tain a loan of a book.
The San Jose, public library .has re
ceived from S". W. Churchill, a citizen
of. San Jose, a present of a bound vol
ume of the San Jose Weekly Visitor
published in 1S51. Gifts of such rare
volumes of newspapers and manu
scripts are highly prized by all libra
ries. -/ 'jit-
The District Attorney's office is
highly elated by the verdict and a
stream of well-wishers crowded Bying
ton's office all day to offer congratu
lations. George A. Knight, the main
stay of Mrs. Botkin, had nothing to
say about the verdict of the jury. He
lias not settled on what grounds an ap
peal will be taken, but no effort will
be spared to secure a reversal. The
new contingency which has arisen by
the action of Deane in swearing to a
complaint on another charge will no
doubt bring about a determined bat
tle to prevent a preliminary examina
tion. Knight expresses himself as sat
isfied with the court's rulings and in
structions. Relative to the charge of
attempted bribery made by Juror
Goetjen during the trial, Byington has
but little to say and evades answering
whether he will take any action in the
matter. He declares that no evidence
has been presented to him upon which
a prosecution could be . instituted.
Chief Wittman will have Goetjen be
fore him this morning, and upon the
result of the interview depends wheth
er further action will be taken. Early
yesterday afternoon Wittman ex
pressed himself as believing Goetjen's
story, but later he experienced a
change of heart.
It Is understood that Mrs. Botkin has
broken down, but she will no doubt
make her appearance in the Police
Court showing" the same stoicism as
characterized her demeanor at the
trial before Judge Cook.
At the last session *f the Legisla
ture Mr. Byington had a bill intro
duced providing for an amendment to
the code so as to allow testimony, of
v.itnesses in former trials to "be used
Â¦when the witness is out of the Juris
diction of the court or dead, but the
criminal lawyers beat the measure. If
It had passed the city would have been
many thousands of dollars In pocket on
the Botkin trial. After the Delaware
witnesses testify the testimony of local
witnesses can be taken at any time.
It Is the intention of District Attor
ney Byington to commence the pre
liminary examination on Monday, if
possible, so as to allow the Delaware
Â¦witnesses to return to their homes.
This move is prompted by a desire of
the District Attorney to have the tes
timony of the foreign witnesses in such
ehape that, should the necessity arise
by a reversal of the present verdict,
their evidence could be read at a trial.
The law provides that testimony given
at a former trial cannot be used
against a defendant in the Superior
Court in transcript form, but a tran
script of testimony given in the lower
court is admissible.
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, convicted mur
deress, will have to # face another
charge of murder. A complaint will be
sworn to this morning by Joshua D.
Deane, husband of Ida Henrietta
Deane, the other victim of Mrs. Bot
kin's crime. Mrs. Deane ate of the
poisoned candy with fatal results. A
Â¦warrant will be Issued by one of the
Police Judges, and it will be served on
the prisoner at the County Jail.
PARIS, April 8.â The condition of
former Queen Isabella of Spain Is ex
citing serious apprehension, owins to
her, advanced age and the complica
tions. . Her three daughters, the Infan
tas Isabella, Eulalie and Marie, are

BARCELONA, April 8.â King Alfon
so left Barcelona to-day on a visit to
Gerona. He will return Saturday.
There was some disturbance here last
right. While the King was leaving the
theater after the gala performance, a
party of Republicans returning from a
meeting attempted to make a demon
stration against Premier Maura, hoot
ing and whistling. The crowd resented
the action of the Republicans and
raised counter-cries of "Long live the
King," "Long live Spain," and "Lons
live Maura."
A free fight which followed was ul
timately Quelled by gendarmes.
GERONA, Spain, April 8.â King Al
fonso to-day received a telegram from
President Diaz of Mexico congratulat
ing him on his escape from an attempt
on his life at Barcelona. The King re
plied, assuring the President that the
report that the explosion was an at
tempt on his life was absolutely un
founded.
SAN JOSE, April 8.â Sister Anna
Madeline of the Notre Dame Convent
at Santa Clara died yesterday after a
lingering illness. Before entering the
order she* was Miss Marie Kast^ of San

Anna Madeline was educated in the
convents in San Francisco and San
Jose, and in 1S97 she entered the order

the Southern Pacific Company, and
Samuel Bird. He lived in Oakland
many years. His wife and two chil
dren. Miss Harriet E. Corliss and Mrs.
Wallace Clark, survive him. ...
Death of Sister Anna Madeline.
With the passing of Mr. Corliss Oak
land loses 'one of its best and most
prominent citizens. A descendant of
old English stock, he traced his
lineage to George- Corliss, who came

of the inventor of the Corliss engine
and an uncle of Rear Admiral Charles
Clark, who took the Oregon around
the Horn and into the naval battle at
Santiago. ';â¢?'-

pearance and gave satisfaction to their
commanding officer and pleasure and
instruction to a large crowd of spec

the grassy bunkers, where they, had a
fine view of the proceedings. ,
Owing to Colonel William L. Pitch

FRESNO. April S. â The deadlock in
the newly elected board of directors
of the Raisin Growers' Association
was broken this afternoon when T. J.
Alexander left the * Kearney faction
and voted for R. K. Madsen for pres
ident. Madsen had wired from Eu
rope that he would accept the oSce,
and Alexander's vote, with those of
D. D. Allison and A. V. Taylor, gave
him the coveted place. This means
the downfall of the reform ticket. M.
Theodore Kearney, the leader of the
reform element, states that he will
not resign, but neither will he partici
pate in any of the affairs of the board.
The board proceeded to organize with
D. D. Allison as vice president, A. V.
Taylor as treasurer and T. J. Alex
ander as chief Inspector, leaving the
office of secretary open for M. T.
Kearney if ,he wishes to accept.
R. K. Madscn Is Elected President of
the Board of Directors of Raisin
Growers' Association.
ALEXANDER'S VOTE
BREAKS THE 'DEADLOCK
Conditions have improved somewhat
during the past week, although there
is still much to be desired. Dispatches
from the South are most encouraging.
At the East more seasonable weather
prevailed, j'et the spring trade is still
below normal. The best news of the
week was the settlement of many labor
controversies or at least resumption of
work pending arbitration. Manufactur
ing news is still confused. Notable im
provement In the iron and steel indus
try "Js ' offset by less favorable news
regarding textile and woolen trade.
Agricultural work progresses rapidly
undejr better than average conditions.
It is V good sign that the month opened
with prices of commodities less inflat
ed. ' Less activity in Western hide mar
kets was not accompanied by weak
ness; on the contrary, limited offer
ings by packers gave increased strength
to all varieties except native steers of
recent salting. ; -. s ;
Failures this week numbered 235 In
the, United States against 317 last year,
and 29 in Canada against 15 a year ago.
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending with April 7, num
ber. 201 against 212 last week, 153 in
the like week in 1903; 182 In 1902 and 223
in 1901.
. In Canada failures for the week
number 24 against 11 last week and 18
In this week a year ago. .
R. G. Dun & Co.'s Weekly Review
of Trade to-morrow will say:
What may prove to be a significant
movement ; in prices was inaugurated
in March, when eight out of thirteen
classes of products including bread
stuffs, meats, textiles, hides and leather
and building materials, declined. The
general level of prices fell off about ten
per cent for the month, but is still
in excess of- a year ago at this time,
and not far from the highest for years
past.
Wheat, including flour, exports for
the week ending April 7 aggregated
1,854,437 bushels, against 1.267.430 last
week; 2Â°833,283 bushels this week a
year ago; 842,033 bushels in 1902, and
640,601 bushels in 1901.
.SOUTH IS. IMPROVING.
The labor situation Is better than It
was a week ago, but Etill retains a
mottled appearance.
The iron trade maintains an appear
ance of activity. Among the other met
als the strength of copper is noticeable.
Surplus supplies are said to be largely
in the hands of a' few concerns, and
much higher prices could be obtained
if desired. :
NEW YORK, April 8.â Bradstreefs
to-morrow will say: Events of the week
have.'for the most part, been favorable.
Weather conditions generally have
been springlike except in some portions
of the Northwest.' This has increased
retail distribution in the cities, while
in the country districts â¢ favorable
weather nas helped farmers In their
planting preparations and Improved
the condition of winter wheat. The
break-up of country roads, however,
tends to retard the sale and distri
bution of merchandise. Wholesale and
jobbing distribution have been helped
in tone rather than in volume by the
Improvement in weather and in retail
trade. In two of the leading indus
tries, iron and steel and lumber, the
resumption of outdoor spring activity
is helping distribution. Collections as
yet do not reflect much, if any, im
provement, and, in common with trade
itself, are especially backward in sec
tions of. the Middle' West, -where re
cent floods have done damage.
â¢ All measures of trade activity prove
the first quarter to have run behind a
year ago. 'Failures exceed those in
1903. by . eight per cent in number, al
though 'five per cent less than in 1902.
Liabilities exceed those of a year ago
by seven per cent. '..
LABOR SITUATION* BETTER. '
Several families occupied the building
and the alarm of fire caused a small
panic. Anderson jumped from a third-
Ftory window, and Mrs. Anderson
threw her babes from the same floor.
Firman Pearsall was thrown down a
Ftairway. All the other lodgers were
rescued In their night clothing with
considerable difficulty. The property
less is not great.
So great were the quantities of water
poured Into the building that West
Broadway was flooded to a depth of
two feet and the cellars of adjoining
buildings were filled.
OMAHA. April 8.â Kirk Anderson, a
lodger, was fatally injured: John Pear
eall, a fireman, received dangerous
Â¦wounds, and the two babes of Mrs.
Anderson were badly hurt in an early
morning fire in a lodging house at
Fourteenth and Jones streets to-day.
Several other occupants of the build
ing were more or less hurt.
NEW YORK. April 8.â After a hard
fight to-day that lasted two hours and
a half the firemen succeeded In subdu
ing a menacing fire in the six-story
iron building at West Broadway and
Tranklin street, occupied by James
Barron & Co., wholesale dealers in
paints and various household articles,
all of a highly inflammable nature.
Twice there were terrific explosions
that scattered the fire, each time giv
ing it a fresh start. The loss was esti
mated at $150,000.

Ill-health In woman is generally traces
able to disease of th: delicate womanly
organism. Many women have been re-
ctored to happiness by the use of Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription. If there
is an invalid woman, suffering from
female weakness, prolapsus, or falling of
womb, or from leucorrhea who has used
Dr. Pierce*s Favorite Prescription with-
out complete success Dr. Pierce would
like to near from such person â and it
will be to her advantage to write as he
offers, in perfect good faith, a reward of
$500 for any case of the above maladies
which he cannot cure.
â¢I feel it my 4x&? to inform yon th*t I had

irritable, and I have a good color in my face 5
havr also gained about ten pounds in weight
and one tkeuiand of comfort, for I am a new
woman once more."
The dealer who offers a substitute for
"Favorite Prescription " does so to gain
the little more profit paid on the sale of
less meritorious medicines.

The warmest fight is 'over the grad

plum in the student orchard. Ezra
Decoto, the incumbent, wants it again
and 'so does A. J, \Woolsey, who has
been Decoto's ; lieutenant . for a year.
There is a considerable organized op
position to Decoto, but he has friends
and may possibly be re-elected. Wool
sey has all the college politicians back
of him and most of the fraternities.

All this red tape 13 designed to put
greater safeguards around the health
of the students. The university au

through poor foods or bad drainage. It
is desired that Berkeley be guarded
against, any such visitation as that
which -destroyed so many students at
Stanford .last year. .."';.' *' %
The Initiative was taken yesterday
by the deans of the various colleges,
who adopted resolutions calling for
such a system of inspections. To-day
the Academic Council took up the rec
ommendations of the deans and after
modifying and elaborating them some
what passed them unanimously. '.. Now
the quality of Berkeley's boarding
houses is in a fair way to be greatly
improved. '
If the student boarding-house keep

the University of California they will
have to permit an official inspection of
their soups and pies and then see their
names posted on the boarding-house

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
\ The will of the late Charles R. Lloyd
is to be the subject of another attack,
which will be based upon alleged
looseness in Lloyd's morals.
Suit was begun this afternoon by
Elizabeth Lloyd Nix, who- avers that
she is the daughter of Lloyd by a wom
an with whom Lloyd lived at Bristol,
England, in the year '1862. and who
was subsequently brought to Califor
nia by him and lived with him in
Oakland. The deceased made provi
sion for both mother and child in his
will, but left them only $7000, whereas
Mrs. Nix states that the deceased had
promised to leave her an equal share
with the other children. Under this
alleged promise she lays claim to a
two-fifteenths interest in the estate,
which has been appraised at $G0O,000.
The relation of Mrs. Mary Skan
Lloyd and her daughter, Mrs. Nix, to
Lloyd. was' fully gone into at the
trial of the will contest begun by young
Frederick Lloyd against . his father's
last testament. Mary Skan said at
that time that she had passed as
Lloyd's wife in England previously to
his coming^o this country. After he
had been here some years he wrote for
her to come to California, and sent
them money for their passage. At
that time he had been divorced from
a wife he had married, and he lived
with Mrs. Skan and her daughter in
apartments fitted up by him.
In the complaint filed to-day Mrs.
Nix states; that Lloyd promised to
make provision for her as of one of his
recognized children, but that when his
will was read it was found that he
had left her but $5000 and the mother
$2000. She" now asks for an equal
share with the other children, which
she states is two-fifteenths ofthe $600,-.
000 estate, or in the neighborhood of
$80,000. The suit is brought by Heller &
Powers of San Francisco and M. . C.
Chapman of this city.

Judge, in Proiionneiiiif*Sen

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, April S.
Luipi Orio. a young Italian convicted
of the murder of L. Gratziano. was sen
tenced to thirty-six years' imprison
ment at Folscm penitentiary this
mornin? by Judge Hal!. The jury found
him guilty of murder in the second
degree, the minimum penalty for which
is ten years and the maximum life. A
dis". resting scene ensued when the
court pronounced sentence. \ The young
man broke down and cried and the
father was so overcome that he had
to be led our of the room.
The crime for which Orio was con
victed was a particularly vicious one.
He quarreled with Gratziano, who was
his friend, over money matters one
afternoon and that night he met Grat
ziano with hi? 12-year-o]d son and sh<-l
him. The victim lingered for weeks,
but finally succumbed to his wound.
The testimony of the iad convicted the
murdered of his father.
Speaking Jn reply to a plea for the
mercy of the court made by Attorney
A. L. Fr'ck. Judge Hall stated that
he did not see how the jury cc-uld log
ically have arrived at sum a verdict,
and that he himself beltcve4 J_he man
guilty of murder Jn the first" degree.
The sentence, however, he said would
accord with the verdict.
The plea for mercy was made on
account of Orio"s age, which is less
than 25 years, and also on the fact
that the crime was not premeditated,
which was implied in the verdict ren
dered. An attempt, partly successful,
was also made to show that Luigi had
borne a good reputation, and this
JudÂ£<- Hall cons5dered when passing
sentence.
OAKLAND, April g.-r^The Board ot
Police and Fire Commissioners this
afternoon demanded the resignation of
Policemen A. J. Hall, one of the re
cently eppomte-1 patrolmen, whose
contradictory stcries concerning his
part in an encounter with burglars in
North Oakland led to the filing of
charges . against him. But the Com
missioners did not get so far as to
investigate accusations that reflected
upon Hall's bravery as a police officer.-
The board first heard a charge that
Hall had falsified concerning his state
mert that he had on a certain night
reported off to Sergeant of Police
Lynch at Thirty-fourth^ street and San
Pablo avenue. Sergeant Lynch testi
fied to the fact that Hall did not so
report and the accused policeman
pleaded guilty to the offense.
After consideration the board in ex
ecutive session voted to direct Chief of
Police Hodskins to get Hall's resig
nation.
"While the graver charces were not
heard," said President .McElroy, "the
board decided that for the good of the
department Hal! should be retired. It
does rot appear that he has the quali
ties that go to make a good police
man."
The Cfcief of Police reported to the
board that he had suspended Patrol
maz\ TV. H. Smith for two days. Chief
Kodgiins caujrht Smith taking his
cose en the counter in a Japanese shoe
store at 1513 San Pab!o avenue instead
of patrolling his beat. Smith offered
Z3O defense.
After hearins: considerable testimony
the charge of using vulgar language
made by Charles Oliver of West Oak
land afrainst Patrolman Cornelius
Keefe was not sustained. Oliver claim
ed that Keefe had insulted him. The
policeman, who has a star record as a
peace preserver, denied the charge.
Charges made against Policeman
John P. Scanlan by John J. Mulvey,'Â«i
crippled newsboy, were continued â¢ for
two weeks. Mulvey's case of battery
rgainsi Scanlan is in the Police Court,
where it has been continued until April
2S. The board has deemed it advisable
to wait a reasonable lengrth of time
pending the disposition of the case in
court before-proceeding with its inves
tigation.
Mrs. Ioab^lle J. Martin's complaint
against Police Matron Reed that sh*

Professor Moses* philippic was di

who used his peach and cherry trees
for house decorations. This desecration
of his orchaiu the learned gentleman
denounced as nothing less than theft,
and he quoted the commandments to

worst of itâ is that Professor ?Joses

finally about fruit biossoms. Here is
what he said, in part:

was about to move a dismissal of the
case after admonishing Stubbs that if
he appeared again on the same charge
prosecution would follow.
"Well, if it does we shall be here
to fight it,** interrupted Attorney
Gentry.
"If that's the way you feel about
it.** replied Leach, "this is as good a
time to fight as any. I have no mo

"In that case we shall have to take
the defendant's plea," said Police
Judge Smith.
"Not guilty." came Stubbs" an

OAKLAND, April 8. â Thomas Greer.
a private detective from San Fran
cisco, who was acting suspiciously at
Sixteenth and Franklin streets last
night, was overhauled by a policeman
and sent to the City Prison after a
search of the spying stranger's gar
ments had brought to light a loaded

Employers Form an Organization Cov
ering Alameda County and Will
Continue Lockout.
OAKLAND, April 8. â The Butchers'
Exchange of Alameda County was or
ganized to-day and a constitution and
by-laws adopted. This exchange con
sists of nearly all of the retail butch
ers of Alameda County and comprises
the men that have been fighting the
union for the last few weeks. It is in
tended to make the organization per
manent and to keep all of the retail
men in line against the union. Those
that do not come into the organization
will not be able to secure supplies
from the wholesalers.
A rumor was started that the em
ployers intended to treat with the
locked out union men, ' but E. A.
Young, who is the press representa
tive of the new organization, said that
the employers had all of the help
they wanted and had applications for
work on file; that, the union would
not be treated with, and that it had
been decided to make no concessions
to the men and to continue the stand
that had been taken â refusal to em
ploy union men.
OAKLAND, April 8.â James F. Sulli
van, a marine engineer working in San
Francisco and living at 1319 Delaware
street. West Berkeley, started to clean
out the street on which â¢ he lived thi3
evening. He came home drunk, beat
two men with a revolver and took a
shot at one and he is now in jail.
The first man he attacked was Dan
iel Foley, who lives at 130S Delaware
street. Foley was standing in his own
doorway talking to Charles Crane
when Sullivan walked up the steps,
took a shot at Foley's dog by way of
a starter and then struck Foley in the
face with his revolver. Foley thought
he was shot, fell through the door and
then ran out of the back of the house.
Sullivan pursued flanking tactics and
went around the house in time to see
Foley coming out of the back door.
He fired a shot at Foley, who jumped
the fence. Then Sullivan met S. M.
Trowbridge, an aged man. and he hit
him over the head with the revolver.
By this time the neighborhood got on
hÂ«s trail and he was arrested. Dr. Glad
ding dressed Foley's wound, which is
not serious.

The Judge's charge and the young
man's tender age and apparent frank
ness were the reasons for the verdict
Erick Blade owed his good fortune
yesterday to two things. The first
was that he was but 17 year old and
seemed rather "raw" at that; the sec
ond was that United States District
Judge de Haven charged the jury that
a counterfeit 25-cent piece with one
side blank could not deceive anybody
or anything but a gambling slot ma
chine.
Blade Â¦went to Truckee from Minne
sota, several months ago and otbained
employment as a lumber man. On
February 8 he was detected feeding
slot machines with counterfeit 25-cent
pieces, one side of which was blank.
The particular machine he was work
ing gave up g-ood money as prizes.
Secret service men found in his cabin
several counterfeit nickels and one
sided quarters, together with melting
pot. ladle and a plaster of paris mold.

him that it was not against the law to

Jury Takes: Pity on the Prisoner Be-
IiLADE IS ACQUITTED
OF COUNTERFEITING
Many of the regents hold to the
opinion that the secretary of the board
should be such a man as would be
chosen for the presidency of an im
portant bank. The cash in the several
funds of the university exceeds $2,000,
000, and real property of a value ap
proximating ten million dollars belongs
to the institution. Therefore theargu
ment is advanced that a man of ex
perience, special fitness and proved
energy should bVengaged. It is known
that the salary of $250 a month will
not suffice to secure the services of
such a man, hence a proposition may
be presented to put the. compensation
at $6000 or $7000 a year and to give the
secretary ample assistance for the
transaction of the purely clerical busi
ness of the office. \ ; '1
The attendance of. regents at the next
meeting of the board will probably be
large. The impression was given to the
interior regents at the last regular ses
sion that the board would proceed to
the election of a secretary at the regu
lar meeting in April.
There will be a meeting of the re
gents of the university next; Tuesday,
and according to the calendar of un
finished business the subject of select
ing a secretary of the board will come
up for considerat'on. The applicants
for the position are numerous, but the
list 'does not contain the name of any
man who is known to possess the busi
ness ability and all around experience
in the management of large affairs
which the secretary, in the Judgment
of many, regents^ ought to have. The
indications are that the selection of
M^Kowen's successor will be again
postponed. There is gossip to the ef
fect that the list of availables has been
narrowed down to three applicants and
that one of these is very highly indorsed
on account of his service as secretary
of the State Board of Examiners.
GoTernor Pardee is in the city at

The counties of SanMateo and Santa
Cruz comprise # the Twenty-ninth Sena
torial District.' A State Senator to rep
resent this district will be chosen next
Novejnber, and well-posted politicians
would not be surprised if Assemblyman
H. W. Brown of SanMateo would be
nominated by the Republican conven
tion and elected by the voters of the
district. He has represented San Ma
teo County in the Assembly for three
terms, and is quite familiar with legis
lative affairs. Santa Cruz has several
aspirants for State Senatorial honors,
but the question of locality may not
govern in the selection of a nominee.
Word comes from Santa Rosa tha,t
Judge A. G. Burnett will not allow his
name to go before the Republican con
vention as a candidate for delegate
from the Second Congressional District
to the Republican National Convention.
It is current gossip that W. P. Ham
mon of Butte and Joseph Steffens of
Sacramento will go to the Chicago con
vention as representatives of, this Con
gressional district.
The Second District is now repre
sented in Congress by ; a Democratâ
Theodore Bell of Napa. His renomlna
tlon by the Democrats is probable. The
district Is normally Republican, but
was lost to the party in "the election
two years ago through the apathy of
Republicans and the intervention on
behalf of the Democratic nominee of
the Gage forces of that; campaign.
Frank Coombs, the Republican nom
inee, was threatened with defeat for
refusing to get in line for Gage.
This year complete harmony, exists
in the Republican camp of, the Second
District, and all indications , point to
the triumph of the party in the elec
tion. Judge Burnett withdraws all
claims on behalf of Santa Rosa In the

At tbA conclusion of the session,
which was after half past five o'clock,
the foreman of the Jury reported that

Knd I have reason to believe that it is

May Macdonough wore a sky-blue
tailor-made and a towering mass of
spring millinery as *?he stood before
the bench in Mogan's court and plead
ed not guilty to the charge of vagrancy.
Fhe appeared to be about 25 years of
age, and riotous living had not entirely
obliterated the comeliness of counte
nance which had been hers in girl
hood.
It was stated by the accusing police
man that the woman frequented ' a
Howard-street saloon and behaved
herself in a way that shocked even the
hardened habitues of the place. 'Then
bit by bit the Judge obtained from her
reluctant lips enough autobiography
\ It was In the Xatoma-street barroom
! presided over by Mrs. Tessie Seabury
that Conrad F. Stenzel first met Mrs.
I Tillie Butterfleld, and it was the tes
| timony of the two women that induced
Judge Cabaniss to remand Stenzel to
the Superior Court to answer a charge
of burglary, the specific accusation be
ing that he stole various articles . of
I masculine apparel from the apartment
J occupied by Mr. Seabury. The defend
| ant had several drinks with Mrs. Sea
bury and Mrs. Butterfleld before he re
warded their condescension by com
mitting a felony, and "It was as much
in sorrow as in anger that they
clinched the charge against him. He
is held in $1000 bail.
Police Sergeant McAuliffe and Pa
trolman Flynn asserted that they had
never, jointly or individually, handled
a tougher customer than Edward
Blanchard, a machinists' helper at the
Union Iron Works, whom they arrested
for drunkenness and disorderly conduct
at the Potrero. He fought them stur
dily and long, andâ if the complainants
did modestly say it themselvesâ no or
dinary police duo could have subdued
him without resorting to the vigorous
use of clubs. The defendant offered
no defense, and Judge Cabaniss sen
tenced him to twenty days' imprison
ment.
"But the carrying, much less the ap
plication, of such a relic of barbarism
Is strictly prohibited in this country.*-'
the Judge elucidated, "and while you
are in Rome you must live as a Ro
man. I hereby declare your 'knuckle
duster' forfeited and order you to ap
pear to-morrow for Eentence."
Among the effects found in the pock
ets of Wilhelm Brandt, arrested for
making night hideous on Kearny
street, was a brass "knuckle-duster,"
and in fractured English the prisoner
informed Judge Mogan that he had
brought the weapon from Germany,
where it Is regarded as an indispensa
ble feature of every gentleman's, per
sonal equipment. Xo genteel Teuton,
Herr Brandt declared, would think of
going abroad without having a
"knuckle-duster" where he could con
veniently grasp it if occasion should
demand its use for either defensive or
aggressive purpose.
Then he raked her in, and picked up
Mr. McQregor as an accomplice. The
prisoners protested that they were only
practicing a first of April Joke, but the
man of law was implacable, and thus
they stand charged."
"What do you mean?" he gasped.
"Don't you see^ â a box an' match?"
she elucidated.
"Where's your boxin' match?" in
quired the visitor, noting the absence
of anything that was even remotely
suggestive of pugilism.
â¢â¢Here it is," responded Mrs. McCar
thy, and she held forth for the officer's
inspection an ordinary matchbox and
a match.
For making April foois of several
unsophisticated admirers of the so
called art manly Mrs. Charles Mc-
Carthy and J. C. McGregor will be
tried before Judge Conlan next Wed
nesday en a charge of conspiring to
obtain money by false pretenses. They
were arrested on the 1st Inst. by Pa
trolman Reade, who caught their
fraudulent enterprise in full swing.
Mr. McGregor stood at the door of
a certain house on the Barbary Coast,
the policeman says, and shouted with
loud voice "Step inside and see the
boxin' match, admission only 10 cents."
The officer, who dearly loves a good
fistic exhibition, paid a dime to Mr.
McGregor and entered a room in which
sat Mrs. McCarthy, smiling fit to en
trance.
Six months for begging and six
months for defrauding an Innkeeper
will be served by Mary Ellen Farrier,
and Annie Meehan will be imprisoned
half a year for the former offense. The
women were arrested for violently ac
costing a Berkeley woman while she
was walking along Mission street.
Judge Mogan sentenced them.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Murphy was a deputy County Clerk
during the Haley administration and
eince then has held various minor po
sitions in the City Hall. He recently
was attached to the municipal electric
ity department.
Cornelius J. Murphy, arrested night
before last for assaulting MrÂ». Augusta
Towie. celebrated his release on ball
by returning to his victim's domicile
and threatening her life. * For this of
fense he was rearrested, and when ar
raigned on the original charge of bat
tery yesterday morning before Judge
Conlan that magistrate Issued a war
rant accusing him of making threats
against Ijfe and ordered him Into cus
tody.
Mrs. Towie is buzom, fair and forty
and manages a lodging-house at 225
Mason street. Murphy, who is a petty
politician, was smitten by her charms,
but his endeavor to capture her affec
tion was handicapped by the fact that
she disapproved his habit of acquiring
alcoholic hilarity. So she presented him
with the figurative mitten, and he
sought to dispel the dejection born of
rejection by imbibing fiery liquids. The
more he drank the more firmly did
he become convinced that the object
of his infatuation had not treated him
as he deserved. Then his adoration
gradually turned to hatred, and it was
with malice in his heart that he went
to her house Thursday night and de
liberately mutilated her new hallway
carpets with his pocketknife and re
proved her interference by smiting her.
The rest has been told. * v :
Ever since James Bamford. baker,
became a defendant in a divorce suit
he has borne bitter feelings against
his wife, and yesterday he was given
thirty days' Imprisonment by Judge
Cabaniss for visiting her shop on
Eighth street and delivering himself of
such offensive language that one of
the. workmen, Harry Harold, was pro
voked to eject him from the premises.
Drunkenness and failure to provide
are the charges, contained in Mrs.
Bamford's petition for separation, and
witnesses testified that they were well
founded. Susan Jcnes said so, and
Mary Silent was sure of it.
Labrada is specifically accused of va
grancy, but behind that charge is the
desire of Mrs. Morales, mother of Al
fonso, to rescue her sen from the de
fendant's influence. Alfonso was a du
tiful lad, Mrs. Morales says, until he
was seen and instantaneously loved by
"Labrada, who thereupon enticed him
to leave the maternal roof and reside
with her. When his inamorata was
arrested about a month ago Alfonso
disappeared, and ever since then Po
lice Officer Mathewson .has been try
ing to capture him. It was the.police
man's weekly report of failure that
brought up the case yesterday.
"He's in the city," said the detective,
in chagrined tone, "and I'm sure to
get him sooner or later."
Other interested persons stated that
Alfonso Has been seen dallying in the
vicinity of Labrada's boudoir, on
Hinckley place, and that it is evident
she is supplying him with life's neces
saries. One woman testified that she
was awakened the other night by the
tinkling of a guitar and the cooing of
a Spanish love song, and that she
peered through her casement and saw
Alfonso serenading his charmer. All
this was denied by Labrada, who as
serted that since she became a defend
ant in court she has neither seen ner
heard from the elusive Alfonso.
"Return to the troubadour's trail and
stick to it." said the Judge to the po
liceman.
Another brief chapter of the romance
in which middle-aged Labrada Morales
and 16-year-old Alfonso Flores are the
principal characters was unfolded yes
terday in Judge Mogan's court, and
mightily was it relished by the back
benches.
"I have many gentlemen friends,"
she said, "and I'm sure they would be
only too pleased to come here and
testify that I am not a vagrant." "
"From what the complaining police
man has told me about you," was the
judicial response, "I'm afraid that your
gentlemen friends are as much in need
of 'character' testimony, as you are.
I'll sentence you to-morrow."
Hay Wilson, also accused of va
grancy, tearfully Implored Judge ' Mo
gran to stay his hand until she could
summon some "character" witnesses.
to Justify him in pronouncing her
guilty as charged and ordering her to
appear for sentence - to-day. . â¢
She married one Macdonough and
lived with him until a handsomer man
alienated her affections, and with him
she dwelt until he died, when she re
sumed marital relations with Macdon
ough, who finally cast her off for good.
That was her story in brief.

A long and notable list, indeed, has been presented
exclusively. . It will amaze even those who have read
the whole scries published by Thc'Sunday Callto realize
that they have been giveji up to date twenty-four com
plete novels.
First on the list was "None But the Brave." Next
followed "The Mystery Box," one of the most thrilling
stcriescver written by Mrs. C. N. Williamson. Then
came "The Autocrat." just at a time when national
politics had the country in a ferment. "Alice of Old
Vincennes" came next.
Immediately after this "The Octopus," that sterling
masterpiece of California's strife and struggle for exist
ence, by Frank Norris, jand which-is. now coming to be
regarded as THE American novel, was presented entire,
making a veritable triumph in progressive journalism.
-Next' came "Judas* Lscariot'' as a Yuletide offering,
complete in two installments, in â¢ the Christmas and
New Years editions of The Call especially.
It* 'was even more notable and timely as a great
religious novel than the play /of ''Mary of Mag
dala," which Mrs. Fiske has just been presenting at the
Grand Opera-house, and in which Judas is made one
of the most powerful characters.
Then in rapid succession came "When Knighthood
Was in Flower," "The Girl Who Wrote," "The Leop
ard's Spots," "The Thirteenth District," "Tainted Gold,"
"The Gentleman From Indiana," "The Mississippi Bub
ble," "Between Two Fires." "The Spenders.".
. Next came "Brewster's Millions." In rapid succes
sion followed "Lees and Leaven," "The Golden Fetich,"
"The Master of Appleby," " A Little "Traitor to the
South/' "The Two Vanrevcls." "Crittendcn" and "To
morrow's Tangle," which latter has just been concluded
in this edition of the Sunday Call Magazine and which,
next to "The Octopus," is the most notable novel that
has yet been written by a California author about Cali
fornia.
' And now, beginning in The Sunday Call to-morrow, is
"The Queen of Quelparte," the most 'timely and one of
the most thrilling of the. whole scries.

indicating an apathy, even among th*
educated masses, toward the English

These efforts on the part of the state

there Is a polyglot club at Rouleaux
that gives prominence to English;
there are numerous private circles de

and La Rochelle; and an English club
of about forty members was recently
organized under the auspices ' of the
Societe Industrielle of Rhelms. In
each of these "Instances the members
are French, the social clubs of the
English and American residents" of
Paris, Nice and Tours not being taken
Into account. In addition to this. It
is quite the habit of well to do fami

of the language. No report indicates,
however, that any are ever sent to the

This Is supplemented by organizations
such, for instance, as the - English

long ago "English crazy." There are
similar organizations at Lucerne,

Before giving extracts from the let
ters that have been received from the
miners by the executive officers of the
California Miners' Association, some
extracts from the Supreme Court de
clpion are repubiished:
"The complaint alleged that the prop
erty of plaintiff (Tuba County) is ad
jacent to the Yuba River, which emp
ties Into the Feather River at or near
the city of Marysville, and that the
defendants are in possession of, work
ing and operating by the hydraulic
process and the ground sluice process
certain mines and mining claims in Ne
vada County and discharging the de
bris therefrom into Sweetland Creek,
a tributary of the Yuba River, about
three miles in length, whence said de
bris Is carried down the Yuba River
and is deposited and lodged in the beds
and channels of the river and upon
plaintiff's property, and will continue
to do so unless restrained. The com
plaint "alleged the general effect of such
raining operations of defendants upon
the Yuba River, which is, by the tie
posits of debris therein, to raise the
bed and channel of the river and
cause the lards on each side thereof
In times of flood, In the absence of
high and secure levees, to be covered
with water and debris, to the great
damage of said lands. V."
"The material question here was
whether it v. as near enough to - the
river 10 be damaged by such overflow
â¢thereof as might be caused by the acts
complained of. The court was justified
In concluding that the operations of
defendants constituted a public nuls
unce. especially Injurious to the plain
tiff as a property owner, and there
fore one to enjoin which plaintiff could
maintain an action. Ac to the county
us a property owner, the nuisance Is
also a private nuisance. The county is
cot Bulnr to protect the rights of oth
ers, but purely In Its proprietary ca
pacity, as the owner of certain real
property."
Extracts from other paragraphs In
thy decision are given, because therein
are treated considerations which seem
to the miners to be of importance.
"The decree enjoining defendants, their
officers, agent?, etc.. frt>m discharging
the <3c?briÂ«5 Into Bv.eetland Creek, or
Yuba River, or any of their tributaries,
ahd from dumping or placing the came
"What effect will this decision have
upon the quartz, drift and river dredge
mining operations throughout the
State?" A large number of responses
have be^n received, hundreds in all, to
date. With one exception every one of
the writersâ all practical minersâas
sort that the effect will be bad and
that it threatens great danger to every
branch of the mining industry in Cali
fornia. _
Some time ago E. A. Belcher wrote
an opinion which was published in The
Call referring to the Kate Hayes deci
sion. As may be remembered, he took
the view that no danger was threat
ened. Several hundred miners take the
opposite side of the controversy. Since
the famous North Bloomfield decision
' no mining question has been ap
proached with more earnestness by
Callfomia miners than that raised by
the Kate Hayes case.
The essential point involved in the
opinion of the Supreme Court is con
tained in a paragraph in which it is set
forth: "It is true that the evidence
failed to show that defendants were
mining by the hydraulic process, but.
admittedly, they were mining by ths
ground sluice process, which, accord-
Ing to the evidence, produced the same
effect In kind as the hydraulic process.
only to a less degree."
These words, in the copies of the Su
preme Court decision that have been
circulated among the miners by
Messrs. Belshaw and Benjamin, are set
In blackfaced type, that they may be
at once noticed by the miners. To
these words the miners in their an
swers to the queries have principally
de\*oted themselves.
A decree was sought enjoining the
defendants from discharging debris
from their mineral lands into Sweet
land Cref k and the Yuba River or any
branch thereof, to the injury of the
property of the county. During the
proceedings the action was dismissed
as to all the defendants except the
Kate Hayes Mining Company and
Charles N. Milter, its superintendent.
The Supreme Court has denied the mo
tion of the mining company for a new
trial.
The California Miners' Association,
through C. M. Belshaw, president, and
Edward H. Benjamin, secretary, sent
out a circular letter addressed to every
prominent mining man in California,
with which have been enclosed copies
of the decision of the Supreme Court.
In th* letter allusion is made to the de
cision and the question is asked:
Within the last ten days an immense
amount of discus-sion has been going
on among California mining men. rel
ative to the effect of the decision by
the Supreme Court of California in
th* case of Yuba County against the
Kate Hayes Mining Company. The
matter came before the Supreme Court
on appeal from the Superior Court of
Yuba County, E. A. Davis being the
Judge who sat. The action was
brought in the Superior Court in Yuba
County by the county, as owner of
crrtain lots of land in the city of
Marysville. on which are situated the
County Courthouse, County Jail, Hall
of Records and County Hospital, and
also as owner of the wagon bridge
crossing the Yuba River from the foot

Quick as a flash the custodian of the
law dived in the suspected pocket.
Grasping a round object,. Minahan
pulled it into light. In the light the sus
pected weapon assumed the form of a
bottle of cough medicine. "Well," I had
a narrow escape, anyway," said the
sleuth, as he departed, and the sur
rounding crowd gave him the laugh.
"Stop him! Stop him!" cried the
pursuing mob. Officer Minahan, fleet
of foot and r fearing nothing, joined in
the chase and rapidly overtook, the
fleeing man.
When the officer came within a few
feet of the supposed colored offender,
who was alleged to have shot two
times at a fellow countryman In Hlnck
ley alley, the negro reached for his hip
pocket. Minahan saw visions of. a
bloody encounter, his mind pictured
fatherless children and a widowed
wife, and rapidly' evolved a plan of
life defense. With his six feet three
he closed on the dangerous Individual.
The man was still digging in his hip
pocket when the officer's ylsellke grip
Inclosed his arms. ' w .
His Escape From Death.-
As so many read and admire Mr. Hearst and wish
to make him President, it is proper to consider his
views of life, government and duty. A party, a con
siderable number of whose members think him fit for
the Presidency, must go to judgment and be weighed
by its indorsement of his ideas, and by the. contrast
between; them and the views of President Roosevelt.' :
A CONTRAST.
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has put mankind
under an . obligation by . his dear- utterance .of
those things which others think. Men have an
unuttcred' sense of the duties which; life imposes upon
them. They hold views which arc not formulated, but
which become the better guides of life when put in
plain" statement. The true must depend for acceptance
and the false for rejection, upon being stated , plainly.
In .his recent address to the Periodical Publishers' Asso
ciation, the- President; stated certain- view* of the re
quirements-of good citizenship. He was speaking to
men- who represent what may be called a new force in
our national life. It is a far c'ry from the original
Harpers* New Magazine, the old Knickerbocker and
Godcy's Ladies' Book, to the numerous modern maga
zines and reviews, in -which science, sociology,' art and
domestic and international politics are thoughtfully and
soundly discussed and fiction and philosophy have a
place that brings them to the more thoughtful and
leisurely attention of the people. Speaking to such an
audience, the President said: "A free people has merely
substituted self-restraint for external restraint, and the
permanence of our freedom as a people" and of our
liberty depends upon the' way in which we shall exer
cise that restraint."
This puts government by law and by the majority
on a different basis from government by that external
restraint which meant the control ol the majority by
an arbitrary will in whose working and direction they
had no voice and no power of control. Self-restraint
is that quality which refrains from exerting arbitrary
control over others, and is devoted to a self-control that
is consistent with the right of others and with their
freedom to exercise the same self-restraint. The exposi
tion is admirable, .and adds an important definition to
the many homely truths that have been uttered by the
President. Their utterance is timely. The vagaries of
theorists and the visions of dreamers have done mucTi
to confuse the ideas of men about their duties as mem
bers of a free society like ours.
Self-restraint runs not merely to the control of appe
tites and the safe .harnessing of passions, but it puts
bounds to the methods by which selfishness exceeds its
proper limits, and when made a controlling force
among men is the safeguarjrof all rights. It is self
restraint worked out into science and called the law
which lies at the foundation pf our system of juris
prudence and appears as the protector of the rights of
person and property. President Roosevelt affirms the
relation between self-restraint and civil liberty. When
that restraint is withdrawn freedom ceases and the will
of the strong is the only law.
By way, of contrast, and, we beg to say, for no other
purpose, this view of human duty may be examined
alongside of the celebrated utterance', often repeated, of
Mr. Hearst. The contrast is suggested only by the fact
that Mr. Hearst is a candidate for the. Presidency and
is the favorite of such a' considerable number of mem
bers of his party as to make necessary the examination
of his views of public policy and of human duty. In
the months immediately preceding the assassination of
President McKinley, when Mr. Hearst was sowing, the
seeds of anarchy and trj-ing mightily to divert- public
attention from the rising prosperity of the country and
its cause, he caused the frequent publication in his news
papers of this advice: "You should be, in as many ways
as possible, a breeder of discontent among the human
beings around you." . .
What kind of society may be expected from the fol
lowing of that advice? If we all, in as many ways as
possible, breed discontent and each one gives and takes
the influences -which cause it and the suspicions and
greeds and grudges which go with it, how long would
life be tolerable? If each fluctuation in state and for
tune, in condition and circumstances, be ascribed to
external influences and men are made continually dis
contented with and suspicious of each, other, how long
will free - institutions_suivive? Iago followed the advice
of Mr. Hearst and was a breeder of discontent in the
mind of Othello. If all become lagos to each
ether, *as Mr. Hearst advises, then society and- civil
liberty will meet the fate of Desdemona.
The assassin of McKinley was a man, a .human being,
upon whom Mr. Hearst's advice had done its perfect
work. He had tuned . his ear to listen only to the'
breeders of discontent, i He did not exert that self-re
straint which induces self-examination, in search of the
cause he had for hatred of the social order and the
Government and its representative, the President whom"
he murdered. Whatever had happened to impair his
personal fortunes or to impede his rise was not sought
for in his own lack of thrift, intelligence or industry.
Mr. Hearst's recipe taught him to look- upon society
and government as his enemy, and he blindly struck at
both.
A letter from Downieville is in part
as follows: "If there is no law pro
hibiting mining except by the hydraulic
process, it is impossible to convince
the honest miner that he is doing an
unlawful act by workng his claim by
the ground sluice process."
Part of a letter from GIbsonville is
as follows: "As I understand it, our
State laws have not prohibited any
kind of mining, but has defined what
was heretofore the only objectionable
kind of mining as 'water under pres
sure through a nozzle against a nat
ural bank.' This is hydraulic mining
and, under ,the Caminetti act, is legal
under certain restrictions. Xo other
kind of mining is prohibited* under any
and all circumstances. There is no law
against drift, ground sluicing or Quartz
mining. It seems to me that the Su
preme Court has gone beyond its sphere
of authority. Under the court's de
cision the hydraulic process, the ground
sluice, the drift dirt and the quartz
crushing processes are one and the
same thing, and all may be enjoined."
One of the most extensive operators
in this State and abroad wrote that
"This is a subject of very far reaching
tendencies. California should lead the
way In the construction on concrete
dams and the Government should help
and allow mining to any extent."
It Is impossible to give extracts from
each of the several hundred letters that
the mining men have written. As be
fore said, all but one of the writers
predict serious interference with all
kinds of mining. "Unquestionably," so
reads a letter from Buch, "the decision
Is a step further toward the final stop
ping of mining operations in this State,
and if this "course is followed it will
ultimately stop all operations in quartz
mining, in drift mining and In river
dredging, all of which produce the same
effect in kind, as the hydraulic process,
only to a less degree."
The entire matter will undoubtedly
be a live topic for discussion when the
California "Miners' Convention is next
assembled.
where it would be liable to be washed
therefrom err removed thereto, and
from suffering or allowing its or their
claims to be worked by the hydraulic
process or ground sluice process and
the debris therefrom discharged into
said river, creek or tributaries thereof,
was warranted by the pleadings, evi
dence and finding:?. The decree further
restrains defendants from suffering
others to use .his or its water supply
or any part thereof for the purpose
of washing into such streams . or
gulches^ any earth, rocks, bowlders,
clay.. sand or other solid material con
tained irr any other ground or mine,
with knowledge* on the part of the said
defendants that the same is to be used
in such manner as to work injury to
the property of the plaintiff described
in the complaint; and also from sell
ing, leasing or in any manner convey
ing, transferring or disposing of said
mine and mining ground; or any part
thereof, or the water supply of the said
defendants or either of them, to any
person whatever for the purpose of
being worked or used by the hydraulic
process of the ground sluicing process
and the mining: debris discharged there
from into said creek or river or any
of its tributaries, with knowledge of
said purposes on the part of said de
fendants."
Extracts from one of the letters that
have been received by the officers of
the California Miners' Association are
given herewith. A mining man in
Butte Valley, Plumas County, writes:
'"Mining is carried on along the north
fork of the Feather River principally
by tunneling, but ground sluicing is
being more considered. We have be
fore us a picture of vast proportions.
The decision can lead to causing all
forms of mining in this State ulti
mately to cease. It will in the next
demand be easier to say that is but
a step from ground sluicing to tunnel-
Ing, because the difference, in effect
between hydraulic-king and ground
sluicing is vastly greater in results
as to the amount of debris discharged
than the amount discharged by ground
sluicing as compared with tunneling.
Hence we feel confident that if ground
sluicing be prohibited it will be a mat
ter of but a short time rhen an effort
will be madv to restrain the work of
tunneling, from the fact that the
amo-unt of debris carried down the river
will not have been materially lessened
by restraining the ground sluicing.
While it is an admitted fact that the
debris of these mines gradually goes
into the river, we can, without fear
of contradiction, say that by far the
greater amount of debris carried down
the river Is not from the mines, but
from the mountain sides and ravines,
whence it is carried to the river dur
ing high water periods; also from land
slides, all without molestation by the
miners."

A fine little baby boy, but one month
old, was one of the . most interesting
attendants at the last day of the thir
ty-first annual meeting of the Woman's
Occidental Board of Foreign Missions
held yesterday at 920 Sacramento
street.
The , Infant child "was taken to the
gathering by his mother,' Mrs.^ C. R.
Callender, who, with her husband, has
been doing missionary work among
the heathens for many. years. In spite
of sorrows that have come to Mr. and
Mrs. Callender through the loss of
two of, their children, in their, field of
labor, they intend shortly to return
to their post of duty.
In view of this fact the little child
was yesterday hailed with delight by
the assembled workers in the mission
ary cause, and was reverenfty conse
crated to the missionary field.
And* if- the parents heed .the advice
of the Rev. Mr. Herriott, who has a
son in the foreign missionary field, the
infant child will be given the name of
Calvin.
Mrs. F. H. Robinson, in speaking on
the subject "Is Home Influence a Fac
tor in Making; Foreign Missionaries?"
asked those that had Just prayed' for
the child who was to be taken^ by his
parents to far-off lands where Heathen
ism abides, how they "dared give the
baby to the mission field if they would
not give their own children?"
Mrs. Robinson, in announcing that
one of her children is to go abroad as
a missionary, spoke out bluntly to those
ttiat live under the impression that
the mothers that allow their sons and
daughters to labor in foreign lands in
the cause of the gospel were cold of
heart. She declared that perhaps those
very mothers were warmer of heart
than those that professed that they
could not part with their children for
missionary work.
He reviewed the Government statis
tics relative to kindergarten schools in
this country to *how the wonderful
fixowth vf the institution knd prove his
assertions that educational work, which
has had a solid philosophical founda
tion and which has met with a steady
srowth, is worthy cf the* consideration
of all educatoVs, economists and states
men. The best results, remarked' the
speaker, cannot be accomplished in the
kindergarten any more than in any
other phases of education without
SHOULD TRAIN* TEACHERS.
We fir.d that the children of the poor often
'j.JÂ«-t under conditions that are so unsanitary
end unmorp.l qj: to sow lasting seeds of III
health and>niiBÂ«ry and to develop early in lire
* tendency toward crime. Their play during
(h* most active period of their lives is Â£ar
riNl on with anything that coni't to hand, and
often In tllthy surrounding*. There is no di
rcctlMI, nothing that tend* to educateâ all u
haphazard, nothing cumulative for good.
Kindergarten training Â»s nt*ded Just as
much *>y the children of the rich as by those
of the poor. Theise <hlldren are usually pam
pered And sel&eh. They are too Jc>nd of hav
ing their own way In all cf th?ir pleasure*
and have no regard for the rlphts xtt others.
Tbeir play is erratic and disconnected. They
are often in charge of ignorant servants, who

develops them mentally, physically and mor

An interesting paper was read by
Trustee Edward T. Pierce of Los An
geles on kindergarten instruction and
the need of kindergarten departments
in the normal schools. The speaker
dwelt at length on the philosophy of
the kindergarten, its history in the
United States, its effect on children and
society and tbe great necessity of
trained teachers to perform this noble
work. He freely quoted from Come
nius. Pestalozzi and Froebel, apostles
of educational reform, and from the
more modern fcuueators who have had
experience in the work of teaching chil
dren in kindergarten work. In dealing
with the nÂ«ed of kindergartens among
the children of the poor as well.as the
rich the speaker said: vi*"^
President Black further recommend
ed that a special committee be ap
pointed to prepare a bill creating a
uniform requirement Tur graduation
from all normal schools. In response
to the remarks of President Black, I.
B. Dockweiler paid that there are 7400
teachers in tht- California schools, but
of that number there are only 1300
graduates from the State ntrrmal
schools. He recommended that the
number of teachers admitted to teach
in each school be limited, and that the
standard of admission to the normal
schools be raised eo that a greater
number of graduates from the latter
schools will be able to secure positions.
C C. Van Liew of Chico submitted
a report from the committee on affilia
tion of normal schools and university,
with special reference to increase of
men teachers. He recommended that
a conference be held between the rep
resentatives of the university and the
Trustees of the normal schools with a
view of determining Just how closely
these organizations can be affiliated.

SUGGKSTS LEGISLATION*.
The annual meeting of the Joint
Board of State Normal School Trus
tees was held In the St. Francis Hotel
yesterday. Governor Pardee presiding
as chairman, and State Superintendent
of Public Instruction Kirk acting as
secretary. The entire day was devoted
to the reading of papers, the first of
the session being one contributed by
Dr. ]>wls Thorpe of Los Angeles.
"Normal Schools as I -View Them and
How Their Fullest Purposes May be
Accomplished" was his subject. He ex
pressed the opinion that if teaching
could only be regarded as a profession
the standard of the normal schools
would be greatly advanced. He sug
gested the advisability of requiring pu
pils to take a university course before
allowing them to enter the normal
schools. A discussion of the subject
was deferred until to-day.
President Samuel T. Black addressed
the meeting on the '"Uniformity of Re
quirements for Graduation from Nor
mal Schools Rather Than Uniformity
of Qualifications for Admission to
Them." He submitted a report which
incorporated the following recommen
dations:

In such a way as to cause many peo
ple who at present cumber the labor
market in large centers of population,
such as Sydney and Newcastle, to
turn their attention to the land as a
means of, establishing comfortable
homes for themselves and their f arhU
lies. C
There is renewed discussion on the
old question as to .whether New South
Wales grown Manitoba wheat will re
tain its character and best qualities if
raised continually in Australia. Inter
est Is specially keen this summer, be
cause the Manitoba or Duluth wheat
proved rust proof in districts, where
rust cut up the other varieties very se
verely. A few growers in the Inverell
district had excellent yields of Mani
toba, the crops' having stood and filled
and ripened well where white wheats
and purple straws were rust-smitten,
and very seriously damaged by storms.
Among other matters to come before
the Parliament will be the Federal
Capital site, on which question there is
expected to be wide disagreement with
much discussion and no definite action,
as the Socialists Insist that the area
of the Federal site to be chosen bo in
creased from - 100 to 1000 acres to the
end that- certain experiments In com
mon ownership of land tilled by com
munity labor can be carried out at the
expense of the Federal Government.
A compulsory fruit pests act will
doubtless be passed in some shape,
and measures providing for the re
afforestation of land will be proposed.
The question of attracting immigra
tion'and assisting immigrants will
probably find a solution for the time)
anyhow, in the land settlement act,
which has been under discussion by
the Ministers and will be proposed in
present position . in the trade of â¢ the
world. Under the head of /'Preferential
Trade" it says: #
Mr. Chamberlain, by attempting to control
this vast and growing trade by restricting Its

ALL IX TIIE ATTACK.
But "regarding this one matter at least we
have aÂ« sure ground to ro upon as anything
In Federal oolitic* is likely to afford u*.
Ministers have pledged themselves to a cer
tain course with regard to their arbitration
bill and the labor party has committed Itself
lo another. Between them stands the oppo
sition some of the votes of which will be
cast on one fide and some on the other. To
that extent the vote will serve the purpose
of winnowing out those who are prepared to
further the designs of labor In politics from
those whose aim is the single end of good
government. As opposition members vote on
this question 65 will their good faith be
judged. But in the meantime it would appear
that there has been a counting of noses. Our
Melbourne correspondent informed us yester
day that the labor party has been making In
quiries and has come to the conclusion that
it cannot hope to carry its threatened amend
ment of the arbitration bill, which alms at
bringing all state employes within Hi scope,
but that it hopes to effect a compromise by
including at least the railway servants.
Labor expects to win. but in that event
Ministers will have no other course open to
them but to resign. In that event, wo are
told that Mr. Deakin will probably ask for
a dissolution That might be granted, al
though Parliament is yet only a few weeks
old If the plea could be established that the
lsrue was not directly - before the electors. We
mlicht in that case expect a general election
in which the electors would be pointedly
asked to Bay by thetr votes whether labor
dictation and domination in Federal politics
were to be- submitted to or not. Such an
appeal might define a suitable rallying point
for that section of the people of the common
wraith which la opposed to extremes and
rash experiments and which desires to nee the
business of government administered on com
mon sense lines. If on so direct an issue thp
policy of the labor party, as it is exemplified
in the stand Its leaders and spokesmen are
forcinc It to take over this arbitration bill,
should happen lo be approved of by a ma
jr.-ritv cf votes, that could only happen be
cause then as before, a majority of the elect
ors "would ' refrain from voting. Once more,
then tbe necessity for organization Is force-J
upon all who care for the real Interests of the
country and who do not desire to see the
commonwealth turned Into a playground for
socialistic experimenters.
The chief concern Just now te to vote the
present Government out of office. It repre
sents in our state politics all that th* party
of rcfoira under all its designations is fighting
agaim-t and the first step toward reform is
to replace the Â£ec Ministry by another. To
do that we must win a clear majority in the
electorates and every seat gained is a step
toward the' vote of censure which will clear the
way for new men.
Again speaking of the conciliation
and arbitration bill, the Herald said:
MINISTERS ARK PLEDGED.
No Parliament ever met In Australia under
such a cloud of uncertainty. Ministers even
shrink from making public the usual forecast
ot the speech they intend placing- In the mouth
of the Governor General. They are unwilling
to discount in any way. by Riving occasion for
comment beforehand, the chances of the first
shuffle of the Parliamentary cards. They have
good reason to fear the future, because It means
for them a reaping of the harvest they and
their rrode^esrors in office sowed In the first
Federal Parliament. They then set federalism
aside for party and protectionist ends, sacrl
fktng the prestige which the Federal leader
ship cave them. To make good the ground lost
by this mistaken piece of tactics they enlisted
the aid of the labor party. Now the labor
I>artv is on the point of exacting Its price.
That intention has been so plainly stated that
it can only be receded from at the risk of im
plying some ff-cret and to that extent danger
ous compact between Mr. Watson and Mr.
De.ikln. The only other alternative is such a
ccalition between the friends of the Govern
ment and majority rule on both sides of the
Ileus* as will enable legislation to be carried
on without labor dictation. There are no signs
thrt such a coalition is possible. The state of
Parliament is chaos. One of the consequences
of this state of things is that there is already
talk of changes of Ministers and the possibility
of -*n early dissolution and another general
election. But even that would be preferable
to the continuance of the present minority rule,
with the prospects of results which Parliament
muÂ»t >ooner or later eet Itself .to rectify under
circumstances which will make that necessary
task more difficult than tt would be it the
nettle were grasped firmly at once.
In an editorial March 1 the Sydney
Morning Herald said:
The second Federal Parliament meet* In Mel
bourne tor ettM preliminary to the dispatch
of business to-morrow, but what course the
Government Intends to pursue, or whether it
will be permitted to manage the business of
Parliament or not." are questions that must re
main lor awhile unanswered. Ministers are
unable to tell us anything definite. All that
the public Is able to learn Is embodied In tbe
statement telegraphed from Melbourne to our
yesterday'* Issue that "deference to the labor
party is to mark the Introduction of early
bills." Ont of them is the arbitration bill, on
which the Government Is to be directly chal
lenged bv that party, on a point respecting:
which Ministers have nailed their Colors to
the mart. They cannot now haul them down
by bringing- civil servants within the scope of
the arbitration bill without taking down ths
mast aleo.

Late advlcea from Sydney, Australia,
by the Oceanic liner Ventura do not
Bhow the fullest realization of tho
promises of prosperity of tome months
ago. While the soil, aided by the rains,
has done Its part toward making this
a record crop year, the labor conditions
have been such as to leave & largo
hiatus between the crops frown and
the harvest gathered.
Some sections, it is true, did well
and gathered maximum returns for la
bor and money expended. But others
not so fortunately situated were com
pelled to see the ripe grain and fruits
fall to the ground and spoil for lack
of hands to save. Yet, at the same
time, on March $ a deputation repre
senting 7000 unemployed workingmen
of Sydney and vicinity, mostly labor
ers, called on the acting Premier of
the Commonwealth, Mr. Wise, to ask
that the Federal Government take
some steps to provide work for them.
The press generally is inclined to lay
the blame for the unsettled and un
promising condition of affairs on the
1 timid policy and action of the Federal
Ministry and on the suplneness of well
to-do and employing class of voters
who neglected their duties as citizens
and electors in permitting undesirable
men to be nominated and in staying
away from the polls on election day.
And they are not very sanguine as
to relief at the hands of the Parlia
ment now in session.

CHAMPIONSHIP v IN. 1 DOUBT.

from W. C. Bishop.
The population of Russia,' 120,000,000,
Is increasing 1,500,000 annually
Saturdayâ California or Stanford. It
Is going to be such a close fit that even
the wisest ones hesitate to hazard a
guess.' ; There is ' no department where
the athletes of one ' university . over
whelm .those of the other. It is going
to be the swifted lot of trials Califor
nia ever saw and no /matter which
wins it will' be only herculean bat
tle that will ; bring > victory. *
To begin with, California seems to
have the'100-yard dash "cinched."'Aba
die always wins and judging from the
Pomona > meet â¢ â¢ will fej have no great
amount of V trouble carrying f victory
from Stanford. .' He easily, defeated Heh
dricksori' of-' Pomona In â¢ that -trial j last
.week. This week Hendrickson â¢ beat
Hamilton! at Stanford in; 10; 2-5 Â¦ sec
onds.--Abadie-has done the distance in
10 seconds flat. .. ,
'In the '220-yard- event , it does not
look so r; easy f or} California.- Snedigar
is California's best,.but he" Is not
looked I upon ) as Â¦; as good ;â¢ as Dunn of
Stanford.;; - ; Â¦ " /â¢ ' ..' 'â¢: Â¦_â¢ â¢- ' ,' -
I The. 440 : yard; dash; is more than like
ly; to ; be '.won by, Dunn. ; .' He has won : , it
the > last ' two. years ;arid I California has
not .produced j anybody who could press
him ; hardy ; Claude^ Kern \ is California's
best and it is" just /possible he â¢, will nose
out â¢CrosBman Â¦ for r second place. â¢ Â¦
The 880-yard run is a stand-off be
tween Clifford of California and Hol
man of Stanford- Holman has been
gaining speed lately and may win. Be
sides Clifford California will have Han
na, Mishler and Edwards, all of them
fairly good men. ..
The mile run is an uncertainty, too.
Hackley, Lyons and Newhall will do
the distance for California nnd no one
knows what they may do against Gay
and Holman of Stanford., Lyons walk
ed away with the prize in the meet
with Pomona and he may turn out to
be a dangerous man., Hackley was not
at his best In the Pomona meet and
may come up.
The hurdles are likely to go to Cali
fornia. There will be Moany, Hume
and Frei to go over the Jumps and one
of 'them ought to beat Lanagan of
Stanford, though it is said Lanagan
Is fast.
Chaplin looks safe for the broad
jump. Stanford's man West has been
jumping over 22 feet, but the Stanford
jump has come advantages that the
Berkeley one has not. Trainer Chris
tie thinks Chaplin will be able to go a
good deal over. 22 feet. â¢
Captain Cooley will have a care In
the high jump this year. Henley 'of
Stanford is a dangerous man and may
beat him out.
-.The pole vault is conceded to Stan
ford on last year's 1 showing by Dole
and Beach, : though Wilcox and
Symmes are going to make them hus
tle. Â¦ . . â¢ â¢ â¢
The shot put, though by no, means a
"cinch," will go to California. Sperry
has been throwing it over 42 feet in
practice and is expected to defeat Hyde
of Stanford, who put it 41 feet 4 inches
at , the Pomona . meet.
. Since Plaw, . California has had no
body phenomenal in the hammer throw,
arid." Stanf ord's N man, _ Crawford, may
whr out. "His only "serlou3 competitor
will be Sperry.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY," April 8.
The varsity baseball nine -has re
doubled its efforts during the week to
get into shape to win the intercolle
giate series. The defeat in the game
at Berkeley last J Saturday, proved a
great surprise to most of the. Stanford
supporters, who had underestimated
the strength of theblue arid gold nine.
It now seems probable that Sales,
'06, who played right field last Satur
day, will be in the box for the cardi
nal in the contest with Berkeley on the
Stanford diamond to-morrow. Sales
has pitched several of the preliminary
games during the season and at times
has proved wonderfully effective. . He
is usually, perhaps, a little easier to
hit safely than is Trltch, who twirled
the first game against Berkeley, but
his steadiness and nearly perfect con
trol offset that disadvantage.
In the game with the alumni team
on Wednesday Sales pitched five in
ningsj striking out three men and al
lowing neither a safe hit nor a base
on balls. In that game he seemed
clea*rly the superior of Trltch, who
pitched the last four innings. How
ever, Trltch has been suffering from a
wrenched hip and is not so effective as
he would otherwise- be. This injury,
may in a measure account for the fact
that Trltch showed to a disadvantage
last Saturday. '
If Sales pitches the entire game for
Stanford to-morrow,^ Knight, who has
played on previous varsity teams, will
occupy right field. Otherwise there will
be no- changes in the : lineup. 'James
Lanagan, '00; football- coach, has been
coaching the cardinal nine in the fl ne
points of the game.; They have im
proved under the tutelage of Lanagan
and a very close and exciting; contest
is expected. Â¦ ' . .
Prospects on the ( track are 3 encour
aging. The mee't with Pomona brought
out ' several surprises. While It had
heretofore been generally, conceded that
California would winj both .'the , high
and ' low ' hurdles, - it . now Â¦' seems ' proba
ble that Lanagan, 'Â¦ '04, 'and McFarland,
'07, will make a close bid * for those
events. . -j: West, '06; and Bill," '04, also
showed \ well in the broad jump in the
Pomona meet,; tying; for 'first place at
nearly 22 feet 3 inches. :ipuhn,\'04, r has
shown great speed in the 220-yard dash
and should prove a winner in' that
event. . . ; : '

Ih R e L^Ie^ti^Ts ixP^r!: L D D TO W pro^ WEEK FROM *Â»**â¢
The clear "weather of the paat
attracted many players to the tennis
courts of the California Club and to
those at Golden Gate Park. It baa
been a difficult matter to get a court
late in the afternoon. The California,
and East Oakland clubs have at last
finished their February tournaments
and the Golden Gate Club will do so
to-morrow. The fourth class was fin
ished at the park courts last Sunday
.and resulted in an easy victory for
Guerin. This makes the latter'* sec
ond victory. Melville Long has won
the cup twice and Hall once.
In the first class there are only four
matches to be played. In the lower
half Drummond MacGavin has an un
finished match with George Baker.
The score stands a set and 4-3 in fa
vor of the former. The winner will
be called upon to play Clarence Griffin
in the semi-finals. In the upper half
Will Allen and Carl Gardner will meet.
It is expected that Allen and Mac-
Gavin, as usual, will meet in the finals.
In the second class only the best
players are left and the remaining
matches should all - prove close and
interesting. Nell Baker, Foley, Lens
and Ambrose are all evenly matched.
Baker is probably the steadiest of the
lot and Is expected to win. Of the
/our Herbert Long is easily the most
promising and the others may find
him a stumbling block to-morrow.
Long has an excellent style, his drhr
ing both back and fore hand being
similar to that of R. N. Whitney. He
has also a fine serve. It has a fast,
high bounce and enables him' to get
to the net in plenty of time. Long's
weak point is his net work, but he is
practicing this every day and when he
brings it up -to his back-court game
he will be a hard man for any of tha
cracks to beat. Griffin. Long and
Schmidt are the most â¢ promising of
the younger players. As" yet Long
does not class with the other two, but
should do so easily in a short time.
Taking everything into consideration
Long Is probably the most promising
player that has turned up in this part
of the State for years.
In the third class Guy Lytton, Har
old Gabriel and Robert Drolla are the
most prominent candidates for class
honors.
The annual intercollegiate tennis
matches will be played at Stanford
next Saturday morning. Stanford is
worse off for players this year . than

ley has good players to spare. Drura
mond MacGavin will be California's
mainstay. He will be first man in
singles and will play; with Robert
Variel in doubles. .
Stanford's â¢ best player is Hodge.
He comes from Southern California,
where he is considered a promising
man. The other Stanford players will
probably be Baker and Lieb. Â» .
"She first big championship tourna
ment of the year is less than two
months off and the cracks are already
commencing to get in trim for it. It
will be, the annual tournament. for. the
championship of San Frajiclsco, and
as usual it will be held at the Califor
nia Club on May 30. George F. Whit
ney won the first championship, Grant
Smith the second and Drunimond Mac-
Gavin is the present champion. The
cup, which was donated by Joseph D.
Grant, must.be won three times., Mac-
Gavin. Allen, Baker and Murdock are
the strongest men playing at . present
and one of them should win. Smith
will riot. compete in the tournament

Contrary to the expectations of the
angling fraternity, the coast streams
are clearing rapidly and with a con
tinuation of warm weather it is pos
sible there will be fly-fishing i next
Â¦week. \ Â¦' Â¦ "â¢'Â¦ >!â¢â¢ Â¦Â¦.â¢-â¢>Â¦? ;->.-Â¦-..,._ Â¦Â¦-
It is estimated there are more trout
In the Paper Mill at present than at
any time during the past five years.
R. Terry took sixty-five near the bridge
at Point Reyes on Tuesday, using an
gle worms and salmon roe. â¢ The fish
were voracious and struck eagerly at
the bait. Whether the fish have gone
up stream or whether they have gone
back to the ocean is a question which
cannot be answered until the test of
fishing is applied. *
The Parser Mill being the most read
ily accessible stream from this city,
will attract a big crowd of fishermen
to-morrow. The bulk of the anglers,
however, are patiently awaiting vaca
tion days, secure in the knowledge that
their favorite streams in the moun
tains will yield greater returns this
year than for many seasons past.
Fishing is reported excellent at Sims,
on the Sacramento River. This is un
usual and unexpected, as it was
thought the stream would not clear' for
some time. It is particularly early
this year. The water is still high, but
it does not seem to affect the bait
fishing. . *
On the Truckee last Sunday the ave~
rage catch was thirty pounds to the
basket. It was chiefly the market
fishermen who were on the stream.
Down Santa Cruz way the majority
of the streams are reported to be run
ning clear.
The striked bass fishermen are hav
ing excellent sport, both in Raccoon
Straits and on Lake Merrltt. R. Sang
ster took ten fish in the straits on
Tuesday which ran from three >to eight
pounds each.
The Portland team cannot win many
ball games until Manager Fred Ely
administers a little elixir of life to his
brown-hosed warriors. When the club
was origin, "y. announced the dope stu
dents shook their heads and predicted
It would be a hard outfit to beat. Dur
ing the first two weeks it was a mat
ter of general wonder that the Browns
won so few games, but it was not long
after the first appearance here that the
reason was plain. Individually it is a
fine team, but collectively, it is about
the limit. There is no. guiding hand
to run things at a critical time. Cap
tain Castro has been the chief offender
in the matter of bad mistakes of the
head.
Imagine a man, who has played in
the big leagues and Is taking a post
graduate course among the minors,
playing for a runner on the lines when
two are out in the ninth inning, the
score a tie and an easy bounder Is bat
ted to short field. Imagine the same
man trailing fifty feet off his bag on
a pop-up fly to the infield, captain
Castro did both of these things Tues
day and Wednesday and helped Oak
land to a couple of unearned games. In
addition to paying a goodly sum for
Castro's release, Ely Is expending a
big salary to retain him. The Vene
zuelan must play vastly better ball to
merit his cost. . f\
Hal Chase of Santa Clara continues
to clout the ball, run bases and field
his position In grand style, but when
the .southerners compare him with
Dillon they are doing the lad an injus
tice. While he has all the ear marks
of a coming star, too much should not
be expected of him. Los Angeles might
be in the same fix with Portland but
for Dillon's headwork and manage
ment. When the leader leaves for the
East the fans will soon notice the dif
ference, as Dillon is a natural leader
and one who commands respect as well
as obedience. Captains in the big or
ganization receive $600 extra for their
labors and good ones are - difficult to
find, as they are born, not made. Mor
ley does not deny the fact to himself,
hence his efforts to keep Dillon on the
payroll another season.
"Rabbit" Miller was the best second
baseman in the Eastern League In 1903,
although the records award him third
pjace. He is a small chap and a fielder
of the Mohler order. His batting re
cord amounted to .260, or about the
Schlafly-Mohler gait. In addition, he
is good at sacrificing and runs bases
in good form. Manager Harris made
no mistake in securing him and his
luck In getting such a man was due to
Jim Morley's foresight When the
peace compact was proposed the Los
Angeles president wanted to protect
himself and signed Miller, although he
really had no use for him. As the name
was on the claim list. Miller could not
play elsewhere without Morley's con
sent and he finally released him to
Harris rather than allow a good man
to escape from the league.
Leahy and Schlafly are .the first
players to sustain injuries and the loss !
of the former is a keea one at this
time, but is all for the best, perhaps,
as Tommy is in poor condition for ac- |
live duty, and the layoff, while his lec
erated finger is healing, will do him
good. Lohman has Clancy to help out
and the absence of Schlafly is not felt
so much.
"Rube" "Waddell will not be asked to
Join Portland, although he was award
ed to that club by the peace pact. Ely
has waived claim and the redoubtable
Rube will be allowed to go in peace
with the Athletics of Philadelphia. The
Browns need no better pitching staff
than they have now. Thellman,
Shields. Butler. Iberg and Druhot have
everything that is wanted.
Yachtsmen are looking: forward with
interest to the first trial of the new
boat Corinthian, which will be made
to-morrow under her own canvas. The
Corinthian was under sail last Sun
day, when she cruised over from North
Beach to Belvedere Cove, but the can
vas consisted of the mainsail and
Etorm Jib of F. Stone's sloop Presto.
These sails brought her over safely
to her moorings near the Corinthian
club house, but afforded 'little oppor
tunity of testing the speed or other
qualities of the challenger for the San
Francisco perpetual cup. To-morrow'B
trial will give her skipper a chance to
eee what the new craft can do, and
will probably suggest some changes
In her trim. The Corinthians have done
well to get their boat out so early in
the year, as they will have ample time
to tune her up, send in a challenge and
pull the race off before the strongest
winds pass away.
As regards the flagships for the com
ing season, two of the clubs will have
new ones, while the other two will have
the same flagships as last season. The
flagship of the San Francisco Yacht
Club .will be W. G. Morrow's sloop
Challenger, the winner in 1902 of the
perpetual cup and still its holder. Com
modore T. Jennings' sloop Speedwell
will be the flagship of the Corinthian
Yacht Ciub. Commodore George M.
Shaw's yawl Idler will be the flagship
of the California Yacht Club, and Com
modore Charles Stewart's sloop Beatrice
cf the Oakland Canoe Club, as In 1903.
The sloop Speedwell was brought out
of her winter quarters in Corte Made
ra Creek two weeks ago. A good deal
of work has been done already In her
cabin, the old varnish having been
scraped off and two fresh coats ap
plied. New and more convenient lock
ers have been built and the centerboard
casing has been cut down so that the
mahogany leaves of the new table will
be flush with the case. Sliding doors
have been substituted for the ewing-
Ing doors, and a folding washstand has
been installed. A gasoline stove of the
most modern type has been put Into
the galley. Evidently the Speedwell
will be made as smart as any craft on
the bay.
A new yacht has been launched at
the foot of Webster street. Oakland.
She is named the Pollywog and will
fly the Cag of the California Yacht
Club, of which her owners, G. N. Tyler
and A. G. Byxbee, are members.
Though on a much smaller scale, she Is
of much the same type as the Corin
thian. Her length over all is 24 feet;
on the water line, 14 feet 6 inches; her
beam la 7 f*et and her draught only
<Vs inches. Her forward overhang Is
5 feet, her af tertians 3 feet 6 inches,
and she will carry S50 square feet of
canvas. The boat is divided longi
tudinally into two sections and has
water-tight compartments at bow and
stern. The centerboard Is dagger
shaped and has forty pounds of lead at
iU point. It can be shifted forward or
aft in the casing and th* rudder is a
balanced one. Her mainsail has a hoist'
of 14 feet, a foot of 20 feet, is 14 feet on
the gaff and 29 feet on the leach. The
Jib measures 18 feet en the stay, 8 feet
on the foot and 16 feet on the leach.
If the new boat proves a fast sailer
r.nd 6eawortny, a larger one on the
same plan will be built and will try
conclusions with the sloop Challenger,
the fastest 20-footer on the bay.
A committee has the opening Jinks
of the San Francisco Yacht Club In
hand, but wflj really have little to do,
as the De Kovcn Society will furnish
nearly the whole of the entertainment.
A few ilrms will be added to the pro
gramme for the sake of variety.

NOTES OF THE TRACK.
SILENT. WATER STROLI^ IN.
tion did is worth repeating. Incident
ally it might be mentioned that the
good thing, Watkins Overton, started
again.
The breaking of a pole in the pole
vault probably prevented Norman
Dole '04 from placing the record in
that event considerably over twelve
feet. He had vaulted 11 feet 8 inches,
the Stanford record, and the bar was
raised to 12 feet 2 Vs inches. In two at
tempts Dole all but cleared the height,
once striking the rod with his arm
after he had gone over it. On the
next trial the pole snapped when he
was In midair and he was compelled
to quit vaulting. He wa? not injured.
Dunn ran the quarter-mile in 51 3-5
seconds.
Clever Work of Stanford Athletes.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 8.
The senior class athletes proved the
victors in the annual interclass field
day. held this afternoon on the varsity
track. The' final score was: Seniors,
77; juniors, 23; sophomores, 13;
freshmen, 13. The results were en
couraging and point to a. Stanford
victory over California on the 16th
inst. While all the events were good,
the best performances were made In
the pole vault and the shotput. Hyde
'04 established a new Stanford record
in the latter event with a put of 43
feet 5 inches, bettering his former
record one foot.

batters always tried to swing their
heads off and always produced large
and juicy pop flies.
Mr. Beck showed what a brilliant
base runner he is during the progress
of the seventh inning. He had singled
and McCrecdle tore off a good one
t<^ frhort right field. Beck loafed on
the way down to second and was forced
< Ut by several feet. A man who does
a thing like that has no license to
play ball in this league.
Buchanan and Butler each pitched
Rood ball, but the rival pitchers were
supported in a vastly different way.
There was no life or snap to the game,
although it was rushed through in an
hour and a half. The heat was so
great that the fan? were too busy seek

The Portland baseball team is a joke.
When Mr. Ely gathered that notable
collection of twinklers he never intend
ed, apparently, that they should win
ball gaities. This was shown yesterday
when â¢ they refused to score on several
occasions and -allowed Peter's Oakland
erg to get away with another easy one.
Score 5 to 0.
'Twss' a * shameful exhibition; one of
the -worst the spectators have been
forced to witness. The Portlanders
*=ay they lost because Jerry Sullivan,
the diminutive comedian at the Califor
nia theater, garbed in a quaint base
ball rcbe. appeared on their bench and
also practiced before the game. This
is a mistake. . Jerry showed himself
"a better ball player than most of the
Portland crowd. If he were on the
team he would at least put some gin
ger into the game.
Oakland shoved runs over the plate
whenever they pleased. It was no
effortâ simply amusement. Runs came
without the aid of base hits. Many
times did Portland get men on the
bases, but nothing doing. The star

Sunday, May 1, between those old
time rivals, the Alameda and Pacific
clubs.
The schedule of the California Crick
et Association for 1904 is out and in the
hands of the secretaries of the clubs.'
It .contains a list of the officers, affili
ated clubs' arid delegates of the associa
tion, the rules for the government of
matches and the list of games to be
played during the season, as usual. It
also contains two items that have not
been included previouslyâ viz., the
names and addresses of the secretaries
of the affiliated clubs and the list oC
winners of the annual championship
since the formation of the association
in 1892. William Greer Harrison, the
first president of the association, pre
sented a silver cup to become the prop
erty of the club winning it three times.
The Alameda Club was, m tie early,
years of the association, the strongest
and became the possessor of the trophy
by three straight victories, in. 1S92, lWi
and 1S94. A second silver cup was pre
sented in 1&95 by Hunter Harrison and
also became the property of the Ala
meda Club, which was champion in 1S03,
1897 and 1S9S, the Bohemian Club win
ning in 1896. This cup was presented
to R. B. Hogue, a leading member of
the Alameda Club, in recognition of
his services to cricket in California,
and was taken by him to New South
Wales, where he now resides. After
1S9S, Edward Brown, president of the
association, presented a pennant to the
club winning the annual championship.
The pennant was won in 1839 by tha
California , Club, in 1900 and 1901 by
the Alameda Club, in 1902. by the Pa
cific Club, and in 1903 by the San Fran
cisco County Club. ,

The cricketers of^ San : Francisco and
the" neighborhood are looking forward
to a pleasant and a lively season. The
Pacific and Alameda clubs will not- be
so grievously. outmatched by the San
Francisco .County. Club as they were
last season,; when" the ccunty team In
cluded three or four players superior
to any in either of the other clubs.
Harold B. Richardson, captain of the
County Club, has not yet returned
from England, but will probably ar
rive in time for. the opening match of
the season.' Bert Kortlang, who really
won the championship pennant for the
Pacific Club in'1902, returned from Se
attle on the steamer Jeanie on Thurs
day night and announces his determi
nation to play with the San Francisco
County Club. With Richardson, Kort
lang, Sloman, Petersen and John, the
San Francisco County team will be a
strong one. E. H. Wilkes has joined
the Pacific Club, which has nearly fifty
members. The Alameda'Club has add
ed some useful players to its roll.
The official rollof the Pacific Club,
as handed. to the secretary of the Cali
fornia Cricket Association, includes the
following:
The veteran Charles Tye of the old
Olympic Club of Oakland was knocked
out in the eixth round by Jack Burke,
whose youth end strength were_ too
much for the older man. Jim Brown
and Arthur Williams, negroes, fouyht
four round's to "a draw." " .'Â¦* . - ..
- Attell took a terrific stomach, punch
and went down in the sixth, and some
heavy ones follpwed to the head.. They
were fighting hard in Attell's corner,
when Monte got himself together.,' In
the eighth Monte stayed down; for a
count of nine under a heavy one to the
head. As the bell rang he was stag
gered with a hot right to the jaw. John
son cut-in with heavy jolts to the head
and followed with Workers to the head
and stomach, but Attell took the pun^
ishment gamely.. They .slugged in., th^
tenth. The last . five rounds ; showed
Attell fighting but ineffectively.% John-;
son went out of the fight : with a;
strained left wrist. Arthur Eekart was
referee.
Bobby Johnson -secured the decision
over Monte Attell in a flf teen-round
boxing contest last night at the Sequoia
Club, Oakland. The boys made a fast
affair of the bout, but, Johnson was so
much better at the punching game that
Atteli had.no chance to win. In fact
Bobby should have scored a -knockout
with his terrific Jolts to the head and
stomach, but in some way Monte man
aged to hold himself together at critical
times and to save himself from the
finishing touch.
Attell tried hard, but most .of his
blows were smothered or blocked. His
right gave out toward the end and
none of his punches proved effective.
He did some clever ducking. The wise
ones all said Johnson waited too- long
in his effort to put in a 'knockout punch.
H e had Attell groggy in the sixth, the
eighth and the twelfth rounds, putting
him to the floor in each round/The last
round found Monte all in, but still try
ing to do something. '
Johnson scored a knockdown . in the
first round, jumping in with vicious
straight rights and lefts that caught
Attell clean on the head. Attell led
"through the second, but Johnson
blocked. Monte ducked cleverly in the
third, escaping some hard swings.
Bobby put Attell to the floor in the
fourth with a heavy left to the stomach
and shook Monte up considerably in the
fifth. '

PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarion's treatises that
is so electrifying the world to-day. HE 13
NO IMITATOR. His work is upon original
lines; PUKE THOUGHT. CLEAR VISION.
He TELLS YOU AVHAT YOU DESIRE TO
KNOW, AND WORKS IN THE OPEN
LIGHT. AND IS AS CONSPICUOUS FOR
ITS WON DEKFUL OCCULT ANALYSIS AS
IT IS FOR ITS ORIGINAL . EXPRESSION
AND VIVID TRUTHFULNESS.
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PEOF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading lor $1. A test is
of little value when the mind is troubled â
you need more substantial aid and advice.
This is just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
gives you when you call on him for a first-
class clairvoyant reading. â¢ Ho asks you no
questions, but-telU you what you wish to
know. - â¢ .
Ho does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes ' you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze. the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

Bros.* General Frisbie promises a sea
son of exciting races. The General
Frisbie, up to this time, has held the
speed record against everything of her
class. The Corcoran promises to lower
the Frisbie's pennant and as Captain
Hatch is a fighter the San Frajicisco-
Vallejo water service will probably at
tract considerable attention from now
on. ,
The Corcoran will begin making reg

yesterday. The Corcoran and General
Frisbie left Vallejo together and the
Corcoran's passengers were going

Frisbie steamed r>ast the end of the

OIL. WELJ.S OP STATE
MAKE A GREAT SHOWING
Total Product for One Year Officially
Reported to Exceed 23,000,000
Barrels of Petroleum.
Secretary C. T. Deane of the Cali
fornia Petroleum Miners' Association
has prepared statistics showing the
standing of. the petroleum industry in
California during the year 1903 and
supplying facts concerning the output
of the several sections that made up
a large output. According to this
statement California produced 23.
602,000 barrels of petroleum and at
the end of the year there were in op
eration 2914 wells.
The largest production was in the
Kern River district, which yielded
15,-570,000 barrels in twelve months.
The next district in point of produc
tion was Coalinga, which made a rec
ord of 2,600,000 barrels. Santa Maria
is credited with 1.OOQ.000 barrels, Los
Angeles with 900,000, McKittrick with
1,700,000. Newhall and Ventura with
900,000. Fullerton with 250,000. Whit
tier with 50,000, the Sunset and Mid
way produced 250.000 barrels jointly;
Summerland, where the oil is taken
out from under the ocean, yielded
100,000 barrels. Halfmoon Bay and
Sargents are each credited with pro
ducing 1 1000 barrels in the year, f* .
Notwithstanding the great lead in
output that the Kern River district
had, it will be noticed that it had many
less wells producing than Los Angeles.
Kern River operated but 750 wells, as
against 984 in Los Angeles, 325 in
Newhall and Ventura, 115 at Coalinga.
138 at Fullerton, 80 at Puente, 103 at
Whittier, 190 at Summerland, 24 at

NEW YORK. April 8.â In the New
York East Conference of the Metho
dist Episcopal church to-day the com
mittee to which had been referred the
charges of heresy against Professor
Jordan P. Bowne of Boston Univer
sity reported that they had found that
none of the five specifications In the
charge had been substantiated and
that they had therefore acquitted him.
This closed the case, as the action of
the committee was final.
Shortly after the report of the com
mittee was read the Rev. C. S. Wing,
presiding elder of the Brooklyn North
District announced that new charges
of a different nature had been lodged
with him by the Rev. Mr.. Cooke
against Professor Bowne. These accu
sations were three in number and in
substance were as follows:
First, that he was guilty of writing
Hbelous articles in the Zion Herald in
1899. These articles editorially attacked
Edwin S. Schell, D. D.. general secre
tary of the Epworth League, and
caused a suit for libel to be instituted
against Charles Parkhurst, the editor.
Dr. Schell received a verdict of $24,000.
and Parkhurst appealed, alleging that
he did not write the article complained
of. The case is in the Massachusetts
courts.
Second, that he was guilty of mak
ing statements to reporters of the Bos
ton papers defaming the character of
others when talking about the case just
decided.
Third, that he had stirred dissension
in the church. Writing in the Metho
dist Review of May, 189S, on "Ethical
Legislation in the Church," he criti
cized the methods of some of the clergy
as "fussy."
The charges "were placed in the hands
of a committee, which subsequently
recommended that they be not consid
ered, and the recommendation wag
adopted by the conference.

Nezv York Stock Market..
NEW YORK. AprM 8. â To-day's stock mar
ket was similar In character to that of yÂ»yter
Â«i. >. â¢Pith few epots of aggressive strength and
wiih .. uressure to sell at other points for
reaUzaitoa of oronts. I va lints did not reach
th<? nx-cct average volume, and the strong
nocks v. ciÂ« rather les* effective in sustaining
tht m?.rkÂ».t .->:Â¦-=.:Â¦-: the realizing at other points.
To-day's '-onsr>icuous advances were In Atchl
*ci. Amalgamated Copper and Brooklyn ltapid
Transit. The movement in Atchlson has been
forÂ«ha.(!owed for several days, .daring which
J^c.nt* have been published on Atchlson's
f--trt.:ip praHttoa of independence in the trans
Â«~o*:tlne:;tai field and the necessity of consulting
It in orxi<r to msintain any harmony of action
!n that nÂ«.;d. The recent great advance in
1'riion Pacific jiolated to a movement :n Atchi
scn, also in compensation. The buving of
Amalgamated Cojiper was OFtensibly based on
the many reports of the strong position of the
Â«-opper trade. The plain evidence cf selling of
I'nion Pacific and i.nit Â¦Â¦â¢'. States Steel preferred
depriv.d the market of what has been its most
effective Eupport, and othe*- eiocks which have
b*Â»n -uci.csFlveiy aflvancod were Fold in the
aarut way. The doting up of a speculative
campaign was thus suggested in a way rather
urpleajiant to the followers of the late ad
vance. Tlie preliminary estimates cf the
weeks currency movement make it probable
thit the loss by gold export* and subtreasury
optraUons has been mostly offset by the re
ceipts on balance by the regular express
rr.oven-.tct. This is vithout taking accouat of
the paying out to-day by the subtreaÂ«ury of
nearly $4.000,<.<K> on account of the Japanese
Ktild received at Kan Francisco veaterday. The
rÂ»vive<l a^tlvi-.y stocks and the week's sale
of tailroad bond issues indicate some expan
sion in tlie I'jan account of the banks. The
iindisturb.d Â«a-e in the money market is clear
proof of abundant resources up to the present,
ani the !...:.k utatcmtnl attracts no Fpecial in
terest. At 'jtr touching tht lowest point of the
Â«lny in the final hour, the market rallied and
closed steady, but very dull.

EASTEBX MARKETS.
Nezv York Money Market.
The Egg market is kept about steady by
immediate storing of the surplus, s o quota
tions do not change much. The -demand is
reported very slack and the market is . devoid
of Interest.
Receipts were 86,9^0 lbs Butter. 1694 cases
Egfrs and 20.300 lbs Cheese.

EGGS â Ranch, lS@10c for fair to choice;

Quotations continue about as before. There
is r.o scarcity of Butter, Cheese or Eggs and
.receipts of Butter yesterday ., were very large,
as will be seen below. A good deal Is arriving
in cub's now. The 'weather has turned warm
and dealers report the Butter coming in soft
in Â¦ consequence. They are accordingly dis
posed to get rid of It as soon as possible, even
if they have to make concessions, whlch-gives
the market a weak tone. Some dealers < are
already quoting lower prices. :
The situation in Cheese remains as before,
stocks being excessive and the market dull and
weak.

The quotations for Game represent the
prices of sound stock only. The bulk of yes
terday's receipts came to hand in bad condi
tion owing to the warm, close, weather, and
no reasonable offer, was refused.
The demand for Poultry was not very brisk,
but the market -was In good shape, as re
ceipts of domestic stock were lljrht and there
was no Western offering. Good larpe stock
cleaned up well at. unchanged rates and small
Broilers, which' had previously been very
weak. : showed more- steadiness. About twelve
cases of dressed Turkeys came in and met
with bIow^ sale at prices ranging from 12Â£?lÂ«c
per pound.' The stock was "grassy" and came
to hand in poor condition owing to the hot
weather. It would be more advisable for
shippers to quit dressing and to send in live
stock.

tacks of Peas. ' â¢ "â¢ ' ..'"Â¦/
Receipts of old Potatoes were only 355 sacks
and' there was continued firmness in all .de
scriptions. There was very little xiew business
to report In table Hinds, as there was practi
cally nothing offering from first hands. The
steamer due from Oregon to-day is -expected
to bring about 0000 Backs. There was a steady
inquiry for seed kinds, and Garnet Chiles and
Early Rose were quoted. The latter were still
meeting with' a lair inquiry for table use as
well as for seed. Receipts of new Potatoes
were 121- *ackn and good stock cleaned up read
ily at slightly 1 firmer rates. " There were no
fresh arrivals of Onions, and . Oregons were
largely nominal in price. | Australians Â¦ were
"offering 'freely by Jobbers and met with a good
demand aty the top quotation. . The Inside rate
represents the wharf i>rlee for round lots.
Trade in miscellaneous vegetables was brisk
and : Asparagus met with a better demand.
Kx'.ra and No. 1. stock cleaned up at 'improved
prices, wRMe No. 2 was well cared for at the
previously quoted rates. Peas were steady -and
Los Angi-le* 'vegetables did better. Supplies
of small garden vegetables from the pouth were
scant. Rhubarb was the weakest and . most
plenltful description on the list and the top
rate was obtained only for fancy lots from San

were the chief consideration of the wheat
traders. With storms in the west ' and central
valleys, apprehension was rife : concerning
farming operations. Apparently the fact, that
moisture was Â¦ greatly needed did not appeal
to the majority of traders. .The market opened
firm, -with July a shade to Vic higher 'at. S70
87VÂ»c to 87%c. Cables, however, were weak,
and it was not long before sentiment eeemed
to change: In regard to the . weather". .'Â¦Â¦ What
vu accorded * bull factor became a weaken
ing influence. Â¦ Some of the big operators bad
wheat for sale on the initial advance. It was
principally Jong - wheat, Â¦ and : the selling -was
done seemingly under the _ impression that the
situation warranted . a Â¦ decline.^ "Crop' report*
ffbm two ''private, authorities .were Â¦- bearish,

bered his frequent threats to end his
own life. His elder brother, Pietro
Carfagni, is a tailor at, 626 Montgom
ery street. Both brothers held high
rank in the Italian Masonic lodges of
the city.
, Carfagni was about 35 years old.
His , victim had Â¦ reached her twenty- |
eighth year. Che had the sum of ;
$100 50in'her : pockets when "shot and]
the tailor had I with him the smaller
sum of $22 70. Friends* of Mrs. Wei
mer said the thrifty woman was In the !
habit of carrying her savings thus
upon her oerKbn. ' â¢
Detectives Taylor and / Colman last
evening foundfa letter at Carfagni's
lodgings that showed he had planned
the murder of Mrs. Weimer as early!
as January last. 'At that time he saw!
her on the street one day -in company 1
with one Peter Mighels, and forthwith
composed a long and desperate epistle
in Italian setting forth his woes. The
woman was charged with having ac- !
cepted a dress from her employer and'
then breaking j her promise to keep
company with him. "If you are going
with some one else," the letter con
tinues, "I want you to pay for the
dress." The rest of the letter is an ac- â¢
count of the writer's sufferings, men- !
tal and physical,- on account of the
faithless treatment of which he deemed
himself the victim.
; Urban Husson, the dead man's land
lord, told the police that his tenant'
had been despondent for more than a
month, and that the revolver with
which the shooting was done had been
purchased a month ago at Rafael's
pawnshop on Kearny street. Carfag- <
nl's threats had been so numerous!
that those who heard ' them finally
came to believe them meaningless.

ITALJAN TAILOR WHO YESTERDAY KILLED THE YOUNG . WOMAN EM
PLOYED BY HIM BECAUSE SHE REJECTED HIS OFFER OF MARRIAGE,
HIS VICTIM AND THE SCENE 'OF THE DOUBLE , TRAGEDY?
It was Just 1 o'clock yesterday af
ternoon that Police Captain Duke,
riding down Kearny street on a car,
heard two shots fired in" Quick suc
cession. When he located the source
of the sound he tound the door of
Carfagnl's shop locked on the inside
and was obliged to enter by climbing
over the transom. Within the small
room lay the woman, face down, with
her arms spread out, in a pool of
blood. The corpse of her v murderer
was lying face upward, the head rest^"
ing on the back of his victim. The
revolver with which the double .crime
had been committed was lying on the
floor near Carfagni's hand. Appar
ently he had died instantly and the
police at first believed that the woman
v/as dead, too, until a closer examina
tion revealed the fact that she still
breathed. Then an ambulance was
called and she was removed to the
hospital, where medical treatment
failed to save her fast-ebbing life. She
spoke no word.
For several hours the police were
at a loss as to the identity of the mur
dered woman, as no papers in her
pockets disclosed her name. At last,
however, her little son, Harold, four
years old, came down town in com
pany with a neighbor's child to visit
the tailor . shop and spend the after
noon with his mother. Then it was
discovered that the dead tailoress was
Mrs. Weimer and that she had roomed
with her child in the house ' of Mrs.
Harry Wheland at 718A Union street.
Inquiry at that address elicited from
Mrs. Wheland the information that
her tenant had been a woman of ex
cellent character and industrious hab-
Jts, who supported herself , and her
son by needlework, sometimes in fam
ily sewing and latterly, in Carfagni's
Murder and suicide were commit
ted yesterday by Luigi Carfagni, an
Italian tailor, at his shop, room 7,
636 Kearny street. After shooting
Mrs. Mary Weimer, his assistant,
through the forehead, he turned his
revolver to his temple and fired a
fatal shot. Carfagni died instantly,
but his victim lived long enough,
though in an unconscious condition,
to be taken to the Central Emergency
Hospital, where she expired shortly
after her arrival. The tailor had long
been importuning Mrs. Weimer to
marry him. This, however, was im
possible, she having a* husband living,
as Carfagni knew, i It is not improba
ble that the young woman died in de
fense of her. honor.

Quite a commotion -was caused yes
terday in the Hawthorne School on
Shotwell street, between Twenty
second and Twenty-third, by the ap
pearance of a swarm of bees In the
schoolyard.- Mrs. S. J. Mann, prin
cipal of the school, immediately noti
fied the Health Department, which
ascertained that the bees came from
seventeen hives kept by Philip Prior,
who lives in a house adjoining the
Burnett School, of which he Is prin
cipal. Mrs. Mann reported that she
would not allow the pupils to go out
of the building until the bees had been
driven away. i."
Maguire and Kane were
then sent to the school and with the
aid of sulphur fumes and the beating
of tin cans the bees were finally driven
to their hives and the pupils liberated.
The Health Board proposes to con
demn Prior's bees as a nuisance and
he will be ordered to hie himself else
where with his buzzing pets or else
send them away on a long journey,
never to return. -';~Vi :i J

Nine-tenths of the external trade of
the Bahamas, which amounted to Jl,
275,000 last year, is with the United
States. The principal exports of the
Islands are pineapples and sponges, and
the Imports flour and earthen and
glassware.
Last week one of the prisoners who
occupies a cell with "Preacher" King
protended that one of his knees was
affected, and In consequence he was
permitted to remain in the cell while
inspection was being made. This was
done to prevent the Jailers from
searching the cell too closely, "and it
worked well until Sullivan received
information of the plot. A physician
was sent for and it was found that
the prisoner had suffered no injury.
When the cell was searched it was
found that the prisoners had cut
through a part of the floor.
A close watch is being kept on all
of the men. Sullivan has all of the
cells thoroughly searched each day,
and is very cautious regarding visitors.
Had the plot been carried out there
would have been a great loss of life
and an affair that might possibly have
eclipsed the Folsom escapade.
A plot on the part of many hardened
criminals to escape from the branch
County Jail was discovered and frus
trated through the prompt action of
Chief Jailer Sullivan last Monday.
Men incarcerated for felonies planned
means by which they could grain lib
erty and, In some manner unknown to
the Sheriff. ;?rovlded themselves with
weapons with which to make a fight
when the break would occur.
Last Monday Chief Jailer Sullivan
was informed that a Jail break was
contemplated. The men implicated
2 re some cf the most desperate crimi
nals in the County Jail, and Sullivan at
once commenced an Investigation. The
prisoner!' intended to do their work
in accordance with the plan adopted
by the convicts at Polsom. Guards, or
whoever interfered, were to be mur
dered, possession of the keys was to
lÂ»e obtained and the doors were to be
thrown o^en to those within.
I Sullivan at once took precautionary
measures. He had the Jail securely
locked, and with a number of his as
sistants he started a search. Each
cell was looked over and special at
tention was given to the mattresses.
After a short investigation the efforts
of Sullivan were rewarded, for nearly
two buckets full of knives and instru
ments were carried out into the jail
office. All of the old mattresses used
by prisoners were' taken from the cells
and destroyed. New ones were provided
and the plan to escape was nipped.
The scheme was exi>osed by one of the
prisoners, but the officers decline to
mention his name or to discuss the
matter.

Yesterday was a day of . conferences
between Â¦'Â¦ the officials of the United
Railroads and those of the Carmen's
Union. Several' hours were spent by
President- Cornelius and Secretary
Bowling- of the latter . organization at
the offices of the company in the morn
ing, and, they put in much of the after
noon at the same place in consulta
tion with General Manager Chapman
and other railway representatives.
The two sides to the controversy pro
fess that they are trying to^ establish
permanent harmony between the com-.
pany v ,and its employes. But thus far
neither the union nor the company has
indicated willingness to concede any
thing from the extreme position taken
by it at the beginning of the contest:
The temporary agreement of the com
pany to break. in no more "students,"
or new men, until the demands of the
union, shall have been fully considered
was a' slight concession in the interest
of peace for, the time being and was
so understood by the men, although
many of them ; profess to see In it an
indication that the companyvis disposed
to a policy of concession rather than to
risk a strike. Others, however, declare
that new men are being brought here
in large- numbers by the company and
are kept in waiting forthe emergency
should the .union refuse to accept the
.terms of the employing corporation.
The demands .of the employes were
taken^ up in detail f or rthe first time
yesterday,: but neither Manager Chap
man nor President Cornelius had any
thing to say last evening as to the
particular matters discussed. That no
decision or agreement upon any point
was reached, was admitted. The con
ference will ' be resumed this morning
and is likely to continue for several
days.
"Many of the men on the cars yes
terday expressed a feeling of hopeful
ness that a strike would be avoided.
