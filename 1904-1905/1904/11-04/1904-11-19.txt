"I admit" that there 13 something

Colby's answer to her employers. -4
"What has become of the money?"
"I don't know," and then she tossed
her head as ii she were bored very
much. . ...
But when the detectives were
brought. into service in the ho;- 2 that
they might recover some of the missing
money Miss Colby made denial of be

made any mistakes," she said, "and tha
ADMITS TILE SHORTAGE.
It is understood that Miss Colby
never revealed her humble occupation
to those she entertained almost regally.
Her particular object on every occasion
was to entertain .Mrs. Conger, whose
stage name Is Miss Mortoa The ac
tress was Invariably the guest of honor
and the good things were, showered
upon her. Many dollars were expended
for candles of the choicest sort. There
were gifts of this and of that, and Miss
Morton had found a friend whose kind
ly attentions were most surprising. And
to cap the climax Miss Colby pur
chased an automobile for $1700 and pre
sented it as a gift to Miss Morton.
Miss Morton has been preparing to
take the machine with her to Los An
geles, but it transpires that there is
still J900 due on it and Lercari. Pera &
Co. will also have a claim against it.
Miss Colby was in hiding last night
and stanch friends whose sympathy
has been aroused rather than condem
nation were helping her to keep out of
the way. Several telegrams were sent
by Miss Colby to her mother in, Los
Angeles yesterday to come to this city.
Miss Fanny M. Colby, bookkeeper,
found Â«her stipend of $50 a month in
sufficient for giving theater and auto
mobile parties at a pace that wna
lavish and she gave way to the tempta
tion of making inroads on the funds
that were entrusted to her care by her
employers. Private detectives now
have her under surveillance while Le
cari. Para & Company, commission
merchants at 415 Davis street, where
the young woman has been a trusted
employe for four years, are having
their books experted to learn the
amount of the shortage.
Louis Lecari, the head of the firm.
refuses to talk of the matter, for ha
hopes that Miss Colby's mothfer will
make good any loss if he will not
prosecute the daughter, and It was for
this reason that he engaged private
detectives. But Charles Lecaxi, a
son, declares that during the past
fourteen months the bookkeeper has
appropriated at least 510,000. This
ii regarded as an unreasonable esti
mate, however.
Miss Colby's friends, among whom Is
Supervisor John Connor, declare that
she is not mentally responsible for what
she has done. They say she seemed
to be possessed with a strange Infatua
tion for Dorothy Morton, who was the
leading woman at Fischer's and who
left for Los Angeles last evening to
take the place of Isadora Rush in tha
Glittering Gloria Company. It appears
that It was Miss Colby who sent many
of the costly floral offerings that werÂ«
nightly handed over the footlights to
the actress. Night after, night tha
bookkeeper purchased a box at a cost
of $3- She gave theater parties, sup
pers and automobile trips on a lavish
scale, and her hand was more than frea
with money.

NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â In the line of
prisoners passing before Magistrate
Whitman to-day was a young man,
whose features and carriage marked
him among his fellows in misfortune.
His name is Germanio Redetio Maltini,
and he is a son of a wealthy Porto
Rlcan merchant. He was found on
Broadway in a weak and sickly condi
tion by Policeman Platte and arrested
on a charge of vagrancy. His clothes,
which had been soaked in the water
and mud and caked in the dust of
many roads, bore testimony to long
suffering. He told a remarkable story.
while I slept. I complained to my mas
ter. He grinned and told me I was
lying. I complained to. the police, and
they laughed at me. Thinking It pifrt
of a plot to keep me there in a sort of
slavery, I refused to work until my
money was found.
"I was suddenly taken before a court
by my master and committed to a re
form school of Honolulu, where I re
mained for two years. They took away
my own name and gave me an English
one, George Brook. I escaped at last and
managed to secrete myself on one* of
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company's
boats. They found me and I was put
among the firemen and ma'de to work
my passage to San Francisco. Finally
I got on a freight train bound East. I
was caught 100 miles out of San Fran
cisco and put off. Then I tramped un
til at last I got to New York."
For three days and nights Maltinl
tramped the streets of this city look
ing for work. Maltini *said he could
easily return to his parents, but pre
ferred to first earn money enough to
go back looking respectable. The po
lice have secured a position for the

Robinson placed his hand upon Ta

monium reigned. Men and women
jumped. upon their chairs and trampled
upon each other in their efforts to view
the prospective battle. Judge Smith
hammered upon his desk and vainly
called for order and deputy sheriffs
made their presence known by rushing
toward the belligerents. In the midst
of the din and confusion Attorney Rob
inson addressed the court: "Your Hon
or." he said, "the fact that Mr. Tabor
is a one-armed man does not give him
license to break the rules of the court.
He must adhere to them." 9
Tabor sh-ok off Robinson's hand and
drew back his one arm as if about to
strike.* But the blow was never de
livered. Deputy Sheriff May announced
himself as an officer of the court and
threatened the attorneys with arrest
if they persisted In their childish ac
tions. The threat of arrest took all
the fight out of the attorneys and they
proceeded with the case.
Later in the day Attorney Robinson
took exception to a sneer by Tabor and
appealed to the Â¦ court for protection,
and almost precipitated a repetition of
the disgraceful scene of the morning.
A warning from Judge Smith, however,
nipped the second wordy war in the

. President Hellman of the Nevada
Bank announced yesterday that the to
ta' subscription for Japanese bonds in
San Francisco amounted to $1,412,500.
Applications for more than $30,000,000
worth of the securities were presented
in the East. The loan in both the Unit
ed States and England was an unquali
fied success.
In London, the necessary amount
was ten times subscribed in one day.
In this country, applications were re
ceived for four days. The bonds pay
7 per eent and are practically the earne
as collateral. It is the second loan
secured by the Japanese since the be
ginning of the war, but if the conflict
continues for another six months, lo
cal financiers expect this country's
capitalists will have another oppor

to go automoblling so often and she
explained that she was a selling agent

will reimburse it. I have no money,
but she has a little property."
Miss Colby was at all times correct
in her habits, her friends assert, and
only the strange fascination for Miss
Morton and the desire to entertain the
actress in lavish style are given as the
causes of her downfall.
Lercarl and Pera are convinced that
while they have been trucking- pota
toes .and. hustling 1 fruit boxes in des
perate endeavor to make their business
a go; Miss Colby has been taking all
the profits to make spectacular dis
play as one who entertained actresses.
Her favorite method, it appears, was to
represent to her employers that she
had paid their accounts with other
firms and to appropriate the money to
her own use. Lercari's credit la very
good and the fact that he let accounts
run for a long time never gave his
creditors concern. By accident the firm
learned a bill supposed to be paid was
still owing and an investigation was at
once started. â¢

MISS MORIOI'S CHARMS,
Under ordinary circumstances Young
would have to give six months' notice
to the Glasgow corporation, but the
municipality was so delighted at the
honor conferred on their tramway
manager that they agreed to release
him In order to enable him to at once
take up his duties in London. Although '
Young was not aware of the fact, Yer- ,
kes has been keeping his eye on the de- {
velopment of Glasgow's tramway ;
schemes, which are recognized as the j
best and most progressive in KUrope; 1
in fact Glasgow's tramways have abJ
ways been held u:> as a model for all
the trann\a> schemes of the country
and Young's name has been closely j
identified with their success. ;
Young's career is an example of men !
who have risen from small beginnings.!
He entered the service of the Glasgow!
corporation in 1875 as superintendent j
of street cleaning with about 200 men j
under his? control. When the munici- j
pality decided to run their own tram
ways his selection as manager caused .
no less surprise than Yerkes' offer :
caused. In his new appointment he will j
have the control of 3000 or 4000 men and
his salary will be a princely one. Or- |
ganlzation anc! attention to detail are i
Young's strong points and these are the j
qualifications that commend them- j
selves most to Yerkes when he has any i
important appointment to make. i
Young was the first president of the 1
Municipal Tramways Association and!
in that capacity he visited the United j
States investigating tramway methods;
in the different cities and towns I
throughout the Union. -It was during j
one of thes^ excursions that he came j
under the observation of Yerkes. . â¢
1 think It rlfj'ut I shouM let you know that
I have been unexpectedly offered an important
rest by Charles T. Yerkes. chairman of the
Underground Electric Railway, of t&ndon, a*
his rlRht-hand man la the control. of the tuDss
Â¦ nd tramways of hiu companies. . l^vasnot
locking- for a new flpld of operation.'* but this
proposition has come to rmÂ» !n> puch- a way
that I coiiM not fln<3 any sufficient reason-for
declining it. , - ;.
LONDON, Nov. 18.â When it was an
nounced recently that Charles T. Yer
kes had appointed a provincial' tranv
way employe to be c his "right-hand
man" in the management of his mul
tifarious train and tramway schemes in
London, business men. generally looked
at one another in - amazement. -John
Young, the manager of Glasgow's mu
nicipal tramways is the lucky man and
it appears that his selection ; for. the
responsible position has come as a com
plete surprise to himself. On the 30th
of September last he wrote a letter to
the Lord Provost of Glasgow 'in "which
he said:

ney Robinson offered in evidence the
statement that Adolph Weber made
before the Coroner's inquest Monday
night. In this statement Adolph said
that he had. carried his little brother,
Earl, from the burning building. No
testimony has yet come up that in any
way supports this assertion. The Dis
trict Attorney Â«nd counsel for the ac
cused entered into an argument on the
subject arid Judge Smith ended the ses

the question of the admission of the
statement under advisement. The hear

and resolution in this regard were as
follows:
Whereas. Milkers' Protective Union No. 8<53l
of San Francisco has endeavored for some
years pan to thoroughly organize the dairies
in that city and vicinity, but such work haa
been rreatly imr>eded by reason of the fact
that thfÂ»se dairies come into direct competition
Â¦with the products of dairies in other localities,
the employes of which are entirely unorgan
ized : and
Whereas, These latter employes refuse to
recognize the Milkers 1 Protective Union on the

Resolved. By the American Federation of
Labor, in annual convention assembled, that
the executive council is hereby authorized and
instructed to make such change In the seo

Union No. 8861 of San Francisco as'rhall en
able that body to organize the milkers of the

GOES TO THE COUNCIL.
Milkers' Resolution Is Sent by Con
vention to Executive Body.
Some discussion took place, in
which the speakers were Sullivan,
Macarthur, Westoby. Devine, Mitch
ell, Zaring and others. A motion to
refer the matter to the executive coun
cil with a favorable recommendation
was lost. It was voted to refer to the
committee without any recommenda
tion.
Macarthur said in part:
Now I proijose to organize these people this
way, Mr. President and delegates: WÂ« pro
pose that the representatives cf the Milkers'
Union of San Francirco and the orsanlzers of
the American federation be furnished with a
charter that recognizes their right to organize
the men of that craft throughout thÂ« State,
and whenever a sufficient number of them are
organized to hold local mÂ«Â»etings that they
fhall be given a certain amount of local au
thority and government in their respective lo
calities. It is not a question, as has been
suggested, of the few milkers in San Francisco
legislating for the entire State: not at all.
CARPENTERS ARE HOSTS.
Borden further said that the ques
tion of reopening the seventy-five mills
on Monday depends on the disposition
of the operatives.
Thomas A. O'Donnell, secretary of
the Wool Spinners' Union, said: "I con
sider the report from San Francisco
very encouraging. I think that the
manufacturers now will see the wis
dom of doing something to end the
controversy."
"The action of the American Federa
tion of Labor," said Secretary James
Whitehead of the Weavers' Union,
'â¢means added* strength and support
for the strikers and will be the means
of prolonging the strike if the notices
of the reduction are not taken down.
The next step now must be made by
the manufacturers. No concessions
will be made by the labor men."
Nine of the cotton manufacturing
plants which started last Monday In
an attempt to break the big strike were
shut down to-day. Three others say
they have made gains.
'"The assessment levied by the Amer
ican Federation of Labor will have no
effect whatever on the manufacturers.
They cannot and will not make any
concessions."
garded by most of the union officers
as the only step necessary to enable
the strike to be carried to a finish. It
is estimated that it costs about $10,000
weekly to conduct the contest against
the mill owners' association.
President M. F. Borden of the Fall
River Manufacturers', Association,
when told of the labor body's action,
said:
sentation at the California State Federation of
Labor convention who have not been notified
are hereby requested to correspond at once
with the California State Federation headquar
ters.
The California State Federation convention
will be one of the larpe?* and most influential
conventions of labor ever held In the State of
California. It is the destre of all interested in
the progress or labor In this State to have the
largest representation possible, and every ef
fort attained to that end will be appreciated by
the officer? and friends of the State organiza
tion. Yours fraternally and respectfully.

The police in several towns have ar
rested Socialist agitators, who have
been trying to distribute among the sol

The most energetic action has been
taken by the War Office to check even
an attempt to create disorders. The of

ROME, Nov. 18. â An Impressive
meeting to protest against the Inns
bruck affair. was held to-night at the
Quirinal Theater. The stage was dec
orated with the banners of Italian
cities that are still subject to Austria.
Among the notable people on the stage
were BjornsjerneBjornson and his wife,
whose, appearance was greeted with
tremendous applause.
The theater could accommodate only
a small Dart of the crowd that sought
admittance, and the police were unable
to keep in order the thousands th'at
blocked the entrance. The troops were
called into service, and after much dif
ficulty succeeded In clearing the streets
in the vicinity of the theater.
All the speakers called on the people
of Rome to make a solemn and digni
fied protest, worthy of a civilized peo
ple Jealous of their rights, against the
killing and maltreatment of fellow Ital
ians, whose only offense was that they
stood for their race In history.- nation
ality and culture. The speeches were
frequently interrupted with storms of
applause, mingled with invectives
against Austria.
An order of the day embodying the
opinions expressed by the speakers was
voted by acclamation and amid cries
of "long live Italy" and "Garibaldi for
ever." The order voices the "protest of
Latin sentiment against German intol
erance, aroused and favored by the
Austrian imperial policy."
After the meeting the crowd, as If in
obedience to a command, made a rush
for the Austrian Embassy and Con
sulate, situated in the piazza Colonna,
in the center of Rome, to make a dem
onstration there. The incident had been
anticipated by the authorities and pre
cautions had been taken accordingly.
Practically the whole population of
Rome, except the Socialists and anar
chists, participated in the demonstra
tion. The anarchists published an or
der of the day, saying that according to
their principles, which do not admit of
differences between countries and In
dividuals, they disapprove of to-day's
meeting.
In several cities, especially Mi
lan, Turin. Bologna. Como and Spe
zia, reservists, called to arms af
ter the general srike recently insti
gated by the Socialists, have tried to
arrange a demonstration with the ob
ject of procuring their discharge. Only
a few men answered the appeal and the
demonstration was easily put down by
the authorities. Some arrests were
made.

THE EMBASSY
Rezin Orr of Detroit, treasurer of
the Amalgamated Street Railway Em
ployes, traced the origin and growth of
trades unions. Trades unions, the
speaker declared, when disputes arise
only want the employers to sit down
and talk It over with them. Unions had
been of great benefit not only to the
working people, but to all the people.
J. D. Buckalew. third vice president
of the International Machinists' Asso
ciation, extolled the trades unions and
upheld the flag. He said the preach
ers could find 416 texts in the Bibla
which would enable them to tell the
truth In regard to trades unions.
H. J. Abrahams, international dele
gate for the British Trades Congress,
followed. He spoke of the Ensrlish
unions and their work. He said all
that the workingmen demanded was a
fair and equitable share of the wealth
which they produce Jointly with capital.
James Wignall. of Swansea. Wales,
organizer of the Dock Laborers of
Great Britain, said this was the best
meeting he had attended since cominsr
to this country. He was pleased to see
so many ladies present. Whether on
this side of the Atlantic or in the old
country, he said, we are all encased in
the same battle and should support
each other.
John Flett of the United Brotherhood
of Carpenters and Joiners, discussed
the advantages of the union label, and
said if the people demanded labels on
the goods purchased they were enforc
ing demands for sanitary conditions
and good wages, and helpinsr the union
men. Industrial peace is the object of
the union, he said.
All the speakers were well received
and frequently applauded.
SAN JOSE. Nov. IS.â The biggest
labor meeting in the history of San
Jose was held in the Garden Theater
this evening in honor of a number of
delegates to the American Federation
of Labor Convention now being h?ld
in San Francisco. The guests were O.
A. Tveitmoe ef San Francisco; John T.
Flett-of Hamilton, Canada; James
"Wignall of Swansea, "Wales; Rezln Orr
of Detroit, Mich.; I. A. Clancy of -San
Francisco; J. D. Buckalew and. John
A. Lennon of Bloomington. III., and
W. Hockam Mahone and H. J. Abra
hams of Rudda Valley, "Wales. ' Sam
uel G. Gomper3 and John Mitchell were
expected to be present, but owing to
the pressing business of the labor con
vention were unable to attend.
The delegation was met at the depot
this evening by a reception committee
and escorted to the St. James Hotel,
where they had dinner. At S o'clock
four hundred members of various
labor unions assembled at the hotel
and escorted the speakers to the
theater. The Fifth Regiment band
headed the parade. A dozen carriages
followed with the guests and local
labor leaders and the local unionists
brought up the rear.
The Garden Theater was filled with
a large and enthusiastic audience, in
which were many ladies. The meeting
was called to order by E. J. White, a.
member of the Carpenters' Union. Af
ter a few words of welcome Tie intro
duced O. A. Tveitmoe, who made a
few remarks and introduced the va
rious speakers.
John B. Lennon, secretary of thÂ»
Tailors' International Union, was the
first speaker. He referred to the open
shop. He said he was surprised that
such a cry should be raised in the
Golden State, for it means cheap la
bor and that means Chinese and Jap
anese labor. The union man does not
btlieve in cheap labor. The success of
the unions in San Jose in raising the
scale of wages, he said, contributed
more to the prosperity of the mer
chants than to the workmen.
Special Dieuatch tu The Call.
CHEER SPEAKERS
Mary Kenny O'SulIivan of Massa
chusetts argued for levying an assess
ment of one cent a day until the strike
Â¦was won.
Delegate Driscoll. secretary of the
Massachusetts State Federation, urged
that the federation should make an as-
F*-fcsment of one cent per week per
member for three weeks and then
lrave the matter to the executive coun
cil to lew further assessments accord
ing, to the judgment of the council.
Delegate Fitzsimmons moved to
limit the time for supplying money to
ten weeks.
Oolden appealed to the federation
for aid and support. He said that 25,-
C00 textile workers had been out on
tmke in Fall River against a reduc
tion of wages eince July 2o. He de
tired that the members of the federa
tion should be assessed one cent per
wek each to provide a fund for the
Fall River operatives.
Last Monday the doors of the mills
vtre opened by the manufacturers.
The workers accepted a reduction last
December, but could not accept anoth
er in July. Men, women and children
rebelled. Local and State bodies in
Massachusetts have already spent
J.GV000 on account of the strike. The
workers were now facing possible de
feat by reason of lack of funds.
ThÂ« American Federation of Labor,
in Lyric Hail, yesterday, declared by
adoption of a resolution "that
the enemies of labor have
organized to aussist each other
morally and financially for the sole
purpose of crushing and destroying: or
ganized labor and the success that has
been attendant upon their efforts, if
allowed to continue unchecked, will
ultimately result in disaster to the la
bor movement; and that the oppon
Â«nts of organized labor axe becoming
more bold and determined, through
knowledge of the fact that the Ameri
can Federation of Labor is not a finan
cial institution."
Following this it was resolved that
hereafter a per capita tax of ten and
one-halt cents per member be paid
and that ten cents a month of this
must be set aside to be used only in
case of strike or lockout.
It was also resolved that, as the
existence of the International Glove
"Workers* Union of America is threat
ened "by reason of the continued at
tacks cf the Manufacturers' Associa
tion" the American Federation of La
bor should appropriate a sum of
money and loan or donate the same to
ihe glove makers to enable their or
ganization to continue its existence.
There is a disagreement between the
textile workers of Fall River. Mass.,
and the manufacturers of textile goods
in the city named. It was set forth in
resolutions that there are 35,000 work
ers in the textile industries of Law
rence. Mass., and that a small part of
the 25,000 is included in the ranks of
organized labor and it was resolved
to place in Lawrence a special organiz
er at the earliest possible time. The
conditions existing in Fall River.
Mass., were made a special order at
the morning session of the Federation
and a resolution introduced by John
Oolden of the United Textile Workers
Iras discussed.

VIENNA, Nov. 18.â During the ses
sion of the Reichstag this afternoon
Herr Pernorstorfer, one of the Socialist
leaders, made a violent "attack on the
imperial dynasty. Referring to the
Innsbruck affair he alleged that the
highest Influence had been used to
prevent a harmonious understanding
between Germans and Italians within
the monarchy, adding that the settle
ment of national differences in the
Tyrol were now rendered impossible for
many years.
The speaker proceeded to refer to the
dynasty, which he charged with being
responsible for all the unhappiness pre
vailing in Austria. The members of the
Imperial family were not even promi
nent for personal qualities, he said. The
women, he asserted, are bigots, and the
men clerical partisans, mostly ignorant
and uneducated.

Ilaffue.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â The Gov
ernment of tHe Netherlands has for
.mally advised Secretary Hay that it
gladly accepts the suggestion that the
peace conference be reconvened at The
Hague. So far no formal acceptances
of thfe American invitation in its full
breadth have been received, but it is
thought that nearly all of the Euro
pean powers have already indicated
through their representatives here or
through the American Embassadors or
Ministers abroad that they accept the
President's Invitation in principle,
leaving to future negotiation the ar
rangements for the conference and the
limits to be placed upon its work.

James Stevens, who the police say
is a "rounder," was arrested yester
day by .Patrolman Patrick Curry ' at
the cornel-;. of Eighth and Harrison
streets on suspicion of being the man
who robbed; the Parrott mansion in
San Mateo on July 31. Although
Stevens . has not yet been formally
charged j with, \ the offense the Â¦ detec
tive department is confident that they
have the right r man in custody.
The robbery ot the v Parrott home
was of a sensational character In that
the burglar gained an entrance to the
houBe, which was occupied by several
servants during the -temporary ab
sence of their mistress, and thorough
ly ransacked It -without arousing any
one. In all he secured about $10,000
In Jewelry and silverware, ~a portion
of which had been in the possesison
of the Parrotts fpr many years.
The robbery was discovered the fol
lowing day by the butler when he
proceeded to get ready for the family
Sunday dinner. A hurried investiga
tion revealed the fact that the burglar
had ransacked the entire house from
cellar to roof and gathered in valu
ables wherever he found them. The
police of this city were immediately
notified, but the burglar made good
his escape. Detective Armstrong has
been working on the case for several
months.

auditory. 4ir. Robinson himself,
Murdiiy bulk and shabbily clad, shook

When the Judge raised his head it
was to ask the defendant what his vo

day. *
"It's de trut' fer you, Judge." paid
Mr. Robinson, "for it's me dat ain't

His Honor did not ceem to be favor
ably impressed either by Mr. Robin
son's occupation or its emoluments,
and when a policeman explained that
the main, if not sole, function of a
porter in a Pacine-atreet 'Joint" is to
discipline disorderly customers by
ejecting them, there was a general and
1 erfectly visible revulsion of feeling
toward Mr. Robinson. It found ex
pression in a pronouncement of guil
ty, supplemented with a sentence of
thirty days' imprisonment.
"An' dis iB wot dey calls Justice,"
vailed Mr. Robinson. "Here I goes ter

dat I tries no hard ter save her from."
Richard â¢ Hunter was pronounced not
guilty of the charge of burglary filed

who averred that soon, after his bed

drunk and Incapable of motion, sitting
upon a near by doorstep and at once
concluded that he was the thief. It In
cidentally developed that "Mr. Hunt
himself had once been tried for larceny
and twice for other offenses, and, the
discovery did. not, tend to bolster his
very flimsy charge against the bibulous

Hipponax won, and the defense claimed
that Hipponax was not entered in the

Special Police Officer W. T. Carham
would not even consider Judge Ca

who accused him of paternity of her
month-old babe and alleges that he be
trayed her by promising matrimony.
Her mother Bays 'the girl is 17 years of

least five years older than that. The
case was continued. - '
LlKie Irwin, alias Bessie Hill, was
arrested eight days ago for vagrancy
and did not appear In court until yes
terday, because when the Jail officials
called "Lizzie Irwin" she neglected to
respond, for the probable reason that
no prior convictions were recorded
against Bepsie Hill. Judge Mogan con
sidered that she had' been sufficiently
punished for both her registered Â«ffense
and her attempt to evade justice, and
ehe promised to face him no more.
James M. Silvia, accused of vagrancy,
declared that he worked three days a
week as* a barber and "got drunk on

custody in time to don his apron this

rested him for exceeding the le?al
limit and escorted him to prison, de

the defendant told the truth, and
Judge Mogan dismissed the case.
Samuel Mercer's wife, an invalid,
was carried Into Judge Mogan's, court,
where she testified that her husband,
S.*muel, had repeatedly threatened to
kill her and his stepchild "at their
home, 85 California avenue, Bernal
Heights. She -is a sufferer from spin
al nervousness, but that fact, she
averred, did not prevent her spouse
drinking to excess and acting like a
madman when intoxicated. He kept
six fully loaded firearms in the house
and the Judge ordered that the wea
pons be produced in court to-day.
Bradford T. Schell, who seriously
stabbed James T. Morriesey, was sent
to the Superior Court to answer the
charge of assault to murder. Judge
Mogan fixed the bail at $2000. Schell

William Henderson, who pleaded
guilty to a charge of manslaughter in
connection with the murder of Po
liceman Eugene C. Robinson at Six

before Judge Cook yesterday. Hen
derson, turned State's evidence and
testified for the prosecution at the
trials of his co-defendants. Woods,
Kauffman. Coulter and Kennedy. He
has yet to testify at the trial of "Kid"
Goucher. This will probably be next
March, or as soon as Goucher is re
leased from the Stillwater penitentiary
in Minnesota.
When the case was called yesterday
Attorney T. P. O'Connor said he
thought: that in accordance with the
arrangement with the District Attor
ney Henderson should gef his free
dom. He understood, however, that
if that course were adopted the Dis
trict Attorney would arrest Hender
son for assault with a deadly weapon
upon Detective Taylor, i
The Judge said that Henderson had
fulfilled his contract and arrange
ments should be made to release him
on bonds. He asked Henderson If he
would be present at the trial of
Goucher. because if not he could be
arrested" anywhere and brought back.
Henderson answered that he would be
on hand at the Goucher trJaL

Improvement In the jobbing distribu

GAIXS SINCE ELECTION.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say: Re
ports from the great basic industries
an? more favorable. and wholesale and
jobbing trade in holiday and spring
goods displays a more connden't tone.
Interior buyers appear more willing to
stock up and are meeting with fair
success, despite the fact that unseason
able weather, activity in fall farm
work and seme holding back by farm
ers retard trade and collections In the
West and Northwest. Cold weather at
the East and seasonable conditions at
the South induce better reports as to
final distribution from those sections.
Trade grene rally is showing g'alns over
corresponding periods a year ago and
the aggregate year's business in moat
lines will make j better comparisons
than at one time seemed possible.
Money displays remarkable ease,
crop moving necessities are about sat
isfied and a return flow from the coun
try is apparently in sight. Gross rail
way* earnings show a tendency to in^
crease late gains and to swell earnings
for the year to totals above those of
1303. Net returns may fall behind last
year, but only slightly.

Foreign trade is exceeding the most
sanguine expectations. Official returns

record with the exception of October
1S00. which reported only 1300,000 larger
exports.
N'EW YORK. Nov. 1?.â Dun's Weekly
Review cf Trade will say:
fiusiness was retarded this week by
the Etorms which interrupted tele
graphic communication, but the loss
was quickly recovered and retail trade
responded to- the lower temperature,
when a large jobbing distribution of
holiday goods occurred. On the whole,
conditions steadily improved. Confi
dence is increasing, particularly in the
steel and textile products, and building
operations are very vigorous for this
season, while mercantile collections 2re
more prompt. Farm staples are slight
ly cheaper in response to splendid dis
patches from agricultural centers, and
railroad blockades have delayed thÂ«
delivery of grain and merchandise.
Railway earnings thus far reported for
November are 8.6 per cent larger than
last year.

All Rescued From Burning Snip but
TAKEN" TO FALL RTVER-
An unidentified man. evidently a
Jew, 60 or â¬5 years old. killed himself
yesterday afternoon in Golden Gate
Park back of the Japanese tea gar
den. His body was found sitting in
a chair with a pistol clutched En the
right hand. He had gray side whis
ker? and mustache, gray or light
brows eyes, bald head and prominent
rose, very wide at the point. The
lothing was a gray plaid coat and
yest. pray striped trousers, black over
coat, gilt sleeve buttons, small black
string necktie and collar turned down
â¢ the points. The collar bore the
laundry mark "411." There was
>thing else on the body by which it
might be identified.
Unidentified Man Suicides.
"For a time these drilled twenties fell
around like nuts from a shaken tree.
Bank cashiers, accustomed as they
were to the handling of money, took
the coins without the least suspicion.
It was only when the eagle eye of
Cashier Tom Burrs of the United
States Sub-Treasury fell upon the rim
of one of the drilled double eagles and
discovered that it had been tampered
with that cashiers were put upon their
guard.
"After Cary returned from the country
a few weeks azo he had net much capi
tal to work upon. Twenties were not
plentiful with him and he was working
at the rate of only one a day. when we
succeeded in establishing an impregna
ble case against him and took him in."
Agent Hazen found that much of the
drilled gold taken from the double
eagle? had been sold by Cary to Hugo
Lardecker & Co.. money brokers, with
offices at 11? Montgomery street. Mr.
Hai.en said yesterday, that he had con
siderable difficulty in inducing Mr.
Landecker to admit that he was the
purchaser.
The secret service men do not believe
the statement of Cary that he drilled
only at the rate of one double eagle
per day. Said Agent Hazen yesterday:
As soon as Cary left the place the
sleuths entered, examined the coin,
found that it had been drilled, and
marked it for identification, at the
same time requesting the young woman
cashier to keep the coin, to be used as
evidence against Cary. Then they
started out shadowing the lawyer
again. Since the arrest Butcher Weiler
has been visited several times by Agent
Hazen, who demanded the surrender of
the marked coin. "Weiler said that he
would give it up if Hazen would give
him $20 for it. Hazen offered to give
him an official receipt for the coin with
the promise that it would be returned
to him after the trial, when he. could
sell it for the bullion value of the gold
in it, which would be about $17. But
Weiler was obstinate, thinking that the
officer was trying to defraud him of the
money. It was in vain that Hazen
showed his authority and reasoned
with him that it was a hazardous un
dertaking to oppose Uncle Sam in any
request of that kind. Finding that
Weiler could not be moved except with
a legal crowbar. Hazen swore to a com
plaint yesterday afternoon charging
the man with being willfully, knowing
ly and feloniously in possession of an
altered and debased gold coin of the
United States. Assistant United States
Attorney Charles tt. Fickert drew the
complaint and United States Commis
sioner Heacock issued the warrant of
arrest. It was placed in the hands of
Deputy United States Marshals Ding
ley and Dryd<?n with peremptory in
structions to take Weiier and the coin
into custody.

covery that a few years ago Cary was
placed under detention by the ilorse
Detective Agency for forging the name
cf Henry Bull to several checks, which
Cary presented and collected. Detec
tive Byrarn took a hand in the capture
at that time. The case was settled
without publicity on the payment by
Cary's friends of the sum collected c-n
the forged papers. Agent Hazen has
learned, he says, that Cary was very
well known, and unfavorably so. for
shady transactions in the Yellowstone
saloon and by Andy Wcods of the Au
ditorium. Mr. Hazen has learned also
that Harry Taylor, who committed sui
cide in this city a few ye'ars ago, was
a client c-f Cary and that Cary's un
fair treatment Impelled him to take
his life.
A comical incident in the coin drill
ing case Is the plight in which Leon
ard B. Weiler has got himself. He
is proprietor of the Sonoma market.

tant, Thomas B. Foster, were trailing

ered a second rope to the ground, and
was pulled safely down.
After an examination of the airship
Benbow stated that the damage was
very slight, only two spars being
broken. He can rr.ake the necessary
repairs in four hours.
When the airship's drag rope caught
in the tree the position of the navi
gator was extremely perilous. The fiy

cr. the end of the rope, more than
eighty fe*t from the ground, and it
w.is only by the utmost exertion that
he prevented himself from, being
thrown from the basket.
ST. LOUIS. Nov. 1. â The airship of
T. C. Benbow of Columbus was cast
loose in the aeronautic concourse at
the World's Fair to-day and it im
mediately ascended eighty feet. Just
after the fiyiixg machine was about to
dear the fence of the concourse the
anchor caught and held it fast- After
being released the hooks caught in a
tree and the machine after being up
fot only five minutes was brought to
the ground. There was only a slight
wind blowing. The machine landed
outside the concourse and was taken
back and housed in the aerodrome.

In a suit begun some time ago Whea
ton asks for an injunction to stop Kales
from digging up the drain which runs
under his back yard. Twenty years
ago the sewer was a necessity and
several of the residents of that part of
the city contributed money for its com
pletion. Kales says that it Is no longer
needed. He says that his neighbors
have no right to maintain it and says
that he has been forced to keep it in
repair himself In order to save his land
from being flooded. Â» " * ''
OAKLAND, Nov. 18.â W. M. Kales,
prominent in social circles, replies to
his neighbor, George H. Wheaton, in
an answer filed to-day to the action
begun by Wheaton because of a pri

homes of both in the Lakeside district.
The trouble over the drain has caused
a coldness between the two men.
Wheaton wishes to maintain what
Kales designates a nuisance and the
discord has assumed the dignity of an
action in a court of law.

-NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â Although two "j
full court days have been taken up in
securing eight of the twelve jurors who .
will decide the fate of Nan Patterson,
who is charged with the murder of
Caesar Young, the incidents in the
courtroom have tended to keep up in
terest in the case. The receipt of a
letter telling of an important new wit
ness was the principal incident.
The letter received was written in
'German and signed "L. Black." The
writer claims to have witnessed the
struggle in the cab and says .that he
saw Young turn the revolver against
his own breast and fire.
"I saw with my own eyes on the
morning of June 4 a man in the cab
with a pistol in his hand. A woman
was seated alongside him," says the
writer. "I saw the man raise the pis
tol, which was in his hand; I heard the
shot and ran as fast as I could. I kept
quiet until now because I thought you
had other witnesses, but for the sake
of the truth I must write you this. I
am willing, should the'occasion demand
it, and If you think it worth while, to
appear before Mr. Jerome and your--,
self and say that I-saw the man hold
the pistol in his hand. I am ready to
take an oath on this, for the sake of
Justice."

away, and while her estate was sup
posed to be worth many thousands of
dollars the" petition sets forth that all
of the property of which she dies pos

tion made is that subsequent to the
making of the will deceased gave away
her means instead of waiting to allow
it to be distributed accor'Ing to the
provisions she had made.
In the will she makes a bequest of
$10,000 to Ellen S. Gordon and provides
that the remainder â¢ f her property is
to be distributed among her six chil

Developments to-day go to show that
Chief Engineer Wallace is safe in his

Interesting results are beirtg secured
by the astronomical department of the
University of California in the use of
the photographic telescope, mounted in
the south dome of the new annex to the
observatory last spring. Drs. Crawford
and Gillihan are operating it success
fully in locating the "Watson asteroids.
The perturbations of the asteroids are
being calculated at the Students' Ob
servatory by Dr. Newkirk and Miss
Hobe, under the direction of Professor
I^euschner.
During the current month plates have
been exposed on every clear night to
two asteroids which are now in opposi
tion, and the asteroids have been found
on every plate.
The photographic telescope fulfills the
expectations of the members of the de
partment. The exposures thus far made
are from one to two hours and stars
down to the twelfth magnitude have
been readily photographed. It is ex
pected that on elear nights, with still
longer exposures, stars fainter by sev
eral magnitudes will appear on the
plates.
The photographic positions which are
now being secured by Drs. Crawford
and Gillihan are of the utmost value in
testing accuracy of the computed per
turbations.

President Wheeler had not seen the
military journal's statement, he said,
but rriade the statement that he neither
had written to>. Washington nor had
heard from Washington concerning the
students' affair with Captain Nance.
Captain Nance said to-day that he
had made no report of the affair to
the department at Washington. His
report to President Wheeler has not yet
been completed, being now in course
of preparation.
W. T. Hale, editor of the Daily Call
fornian, was called before the students'
affairs committee of the faculty to-day
and told that the tone of his editorials
would not be tolerated. Hale's edito
rial about the order of Captain Nance,
requiring the seniors to march In or
derly style'lnto his classroom, was par
ticularly objected to by the committee,
which deemed to think that the edito
rial was undignified and improper, as
the military class was referred to as a
"military kindergarten" and Captain
Nance as a "schoolmaster." Hale is on
the list of seniors whose cases are now
in Captain Nance's hands.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler to
day declared that he will not interfere
in the argument sixty-three members
of the senior class are having with
their military instructor about their
conduct three weeks ago in connection
with the riot on the campus over his
marching or,der, and that if Captain
Nance recommends that the sixty-three
students or any part of that number be
dropped from the class, for cause, he
will approve the recommendation, and
the seniors will be dropped.
The president said that he had not
received any communications from the
War Department and had not sent any
report of the affair to Washington. This
declaration was made by him in reply
to an inquiry about the correctness of
the editorial statement of the Army and
Navy Journal of New York, which re
ported, apparently upon authority and
without reservation, that news of the
students' riot" had come to the depart
ment at Washington and that the uni
versity authorities had then been ad
vised to drop the offending students.

The report concludes with the follow

Officfr Hamerton was asked if what Clark
ha>l said was true and correct. He answered,
Â¦'Yes, it ww." â¢
At first Officer Hamerton emphatically denied

sirce he had been a police officer, stating that
a job was being put up on him and that there
was no reason why be should be so falsely

Sergeant Clark was brought Into the office
and in the presence of Officer Hamerton; stated
that he and Hamilton went to Buswell's paint
store on Broadway and each got a ix>t of
paint, that he took his pot of paint down to
his boat. Hamerton hid his pot of paint in
the entrance to the Blake & Moffitt build-
Ing behind a wire mat. Turning to Hamerton

case of all it is urxed that tie taxation
Is contrary to the principle that v?sse:s

of where th<=Â»7 are earned.
It is costended that the la^v providin?
for the taxation of vessels where the>

it is in conflict vnzH the e: restitution.

i i T-x OUBLE HARNESS," Anthony Hope's latest novel, be
\ J gins in the Sunday Call Magazine to-morrow. The
* â work of Anthonv Hope is familiar to all readers' of
fiction. Since "The Prisoner of Zenda" stamped him as one
of the greatest romanticists of the present day, he has held
his high place with a succession of equally powerful nov
els which have been popular successes of their day, notably
'â¢Rupert of Hentzau," "Captain Dieppe" and "The Dolly Dialogues."
In the present novel, "Double Harness," all of his keen insight into
human character, all his faculty for creating intensely dramatic situa
tions and his keen and polished word play, are displayed at the very
zenith of their art. This is one of the highest class fiction offerings
that the Sunday Call has ever given, and can be strongly recom
mended both as a novel of pastime for those who only desire a good
story and as a problem novel, dealing with a frequent combination
arising in married life, for those \vho v like their novel with a prob
lem. The novel will be published complete in four installments.
Another feature of interest is the publication of the first prize
story in the fiction contest, entitled "At the Fountain of Trevi," writ
ten by Cora Cressy Crow. Opie Read, whose stories of Kentucky
and Southern life are well known, begins a series of reflections on
topics of general interest in "Jottings of Old Lim Jucklin." The first
article of the series is entitled "On Hell," a title which is sufficiently
explicit. There are several special Thanksgiving features: "New
Decorative Scheme for the Thanksgiving Table," by Anna Richard
son, giving hints to hostesses for original schemes for table decora
tions: "After the Thanksgiving Dinner â What?" containing hints
for enjoyable pastimes for the evening; and "An Old-Fashioned New
England Thanksgiving Dinner," which will look familiar to those
who come from the land of apple cider, pumpkin pies and roast
turkey.

THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
"Might be the Emperor William trav
eling incog.," she mused, as her aroused
glance took in the square-set shoulders,
clear-cut face and crisp hair. A few
months earlier it would not have oc
curred to her to notice a man in over
alls and blouse at all. Seen from her
carriage, they had been mere shadows,
by no means human beings. Now all
was different. Though she began to
suspect that the pursuit of knowledge
was only another of the endless make
shifts by which we strive to forget the
ennui of life, she had learned one cardi
nal factâ namely, that the humblest
worker shares all the most Important
things of life with the greatest po
tentate.
The young workman, meantime, had
dropped Into a corner seat, thrown one
leg over the other, and, with an arm
extended along the back of the seat,
turned a preoccupied glance out of the
window, thereby presenting to his vis
a-vis a profile that, to say the least,
bespoke absolute physical integrity.
His hands, she noticed with grow
ing wonder, though large and power
ful, were of the sort most frequently
seen protruding from the sleeves of
modish tweeds or knowing Tuxe
dos. Emerging from the sleeves
of a blouse they were nothing
short of startling, and Miss Sinclair
was stirred by an Interest that degen
erated Into curiosity. What manner of
workman could he be, who wore all
the habiliments of toil with the air of
one descended from a throne for an
hour's masquerading?
With an abrupt turn of the head,
uncannily suggestive of his having
heard her mute query, he turned and
received her puzzled glance full in the
face. For a moment they stared at
each other with- the undisturbed
frankness of a pair of children. Thei^
Miss Sinclair, with an acute recollec
tion of the newly, acquired fact that
the humblest of tollers is a person
and not a thing, withdrew her eyes,
while the man in overalls took his
turn at inspecting. It was for this
reason that she did not see the slight
twitch of the lips that had followed
the open amazement of her glance.
When, later in the day, she recalled
the little scene that followed, she
cculd not find but one excuse. It was
an upflare of that madness which a
certain philosopher had long since dis
covered as lurking In each and every
human brain.
A quick, resolute desire to know
who and what he was had seized her,
and for twenty-five years she had
been accustomed to getting what she
/wanted. Was he not. by every token

that might come to â to fix the electric
She was listlessly thinking some such
thoughts as these one her way to a
lecture one day, when 'a man in overalls
and blouse boarded the car. Something
in the way he carried himself attracted
her attention.
In this wise the winter days marched
by, keeping step, it seemed to her, with
a grim, stupefying monotony. Whether
she looked backward into the past or
forward into the future, the view was
the same â a blur of gray days huddled
together by the perspective.
rather astounding size. This possibly
had something to do with the depres
sion of mind that drove her into the
serious field of sociology, the very rich
and the very poor being in practically
the same predicament. To have every
wish gratified is in effect as crushing
as to have no wish gratified. This is
as plain as a pikestaff, and it doubtless
had something to do with Marcia Sin
clair's unnatural thirst for knowledge.
In consequence, she might have been
seen almost any day that winter wend
ing her way up to Columbia, clad in
austere tailor-made gowns and carry
ing a book or two, as the "outward vis
ible sign" of her inward Intensity. So
ciology, she decided at the start, should
begin at 'home, and thereupon she
abandoned her carriage and took to
street cars, thereby seeing more of real
life than she ever had seen before.

When the corners of a wom

THE seventh annual banquet of the San Francisco Merchants'
Association furnished material for study and reflection that
will attract attention throughout the Union. It dealt with the
jobbery and the crime that are features in municipal -government
and politics in every city in the country that is big enough to
tempt crime by the amount of spoils in sight. Therefore the sit
uation considered and discussed is a universal condition and in that
lies the reason why the interest in what was said will be general.
If only San Francisco presented the features that were de
nounced, this would be a city singular in its misfortune. But it is
singular only in the determination of this strong body of men
that these evils should be hunted in their last hiding place, and
that those who are responsible for them shall be punished. Presi
dent Symmes sounded the keynote in his introductory address by
saying that once the association was "satisfied in seeing that the
streets were well swept, but now we are determined to sweep the
polls and sweep them clean."
Mr. Loveland traced the effect of criminal politics into the cost
of municipal government, showing that the public expense of New
York City is greater than the cost of the civil government of the
United States, and that the municipal expenses of that city are
greater than those of Rome in the days of the empire. Mr. Phelan
declared that people feared the red flag of anarchy, but were patient
when over city government was raised the red flag of the auctioneer,
meaning that everything is for 'sale. Mr. McNab said:
r"In universal' suffrage, where the citizen acts he is his own
politician, and there is room for none other. The boss is the agent
of the absent voter, so constituted by neglect of duty. The only
practical politics I know of consists in voting. The rule of the
professional politician is minority rule. It is dependent on the
refusal or neglect of the majority to act."
Mr. Fairfax Wheelan described his effort to purge the primary
of fraud, giving details not before made public. Throughout a de
termination was expressed to push the prosecutions now on and to
add others, until the courts and juries have had a chance to join
the association and all good citizens in compelling fraud at elections
and crimes against the franchise to cease in this city. In every
speech rings the sentiment that all citizens must take a hand in
making elections what the law intends and the safety of the com
munity requires, the exact register of the will of the majority.
There is no doubt that the action of the association in prosecuting
the agents of fraud at the August primary was entirely instrumental
in securing the clean election in November. That proves the power
and. influence that proper attention by decent citizens exerts upon
those who will be criminal at the polls when they are not watched
and fear no punishment. Many feared that this activity of the
association would be sporadic, that it would be in the nature of a
raid into the stronghold of the enemies of good government, to
make immediate reprisals, and then would cease. But all such ap
prehension is set- at rest by the clearly expressed determination to
keep ceaseless watch and maintain the threat of punishment and
the power to make it good.
The peculiar charter of the city makes this more necessary than
ever. It furnishes a concentration of power which even the wisest
and the best of executives may fail to administer properly, unless
he is assisted by the honest and decent citizens of the community.
Perhaps the best of all the work proposed by the association is that
of keeping every citizen reminded of his highest civic duty, the duty
of voting at every primary and at every election. He may be sure
that if he fail to vote some stuffer will vote for him. The prosecu
tion of offenders by the association for crimes actually committed is
a function that may be temporary. But rousing the civic spirit of
those who offend by neglect of duty at the primary and the election
is a permanent function. In its annual meetings and in all ways
by which it may reach the public the association must make the
citizen who snubs the poll feel that he, too, is an offender against
good government. He cannot be punished for not voting except as
he stands his share of the punishment of bad, costly and corrupt
government. But as he visits that punishment also upon the inno
cent, upon the dutiful citizen whom he neglected to assist by voting,
he is doubly responsible and twicer-guilty. He is responsible for bad
government and for the suffering of its consequences by those who
tried to make it good by doing their duty. V;
The proceedings of the association at its banquet were inspiring.
They sound like a bugle call. They are like a fresh and wholesome
jrale that clears the air of its clouds and offensive odors. They dis
tinctly dignify and ennoble San Francisco, and sound far afield with
a note of hi^h purpose tliat-encourages the victims of misgovern
ment everywhere to apply the remedy by doing their duty.

in labor unions," she continued, with a
beautiful directness, "and I should
so like to hear labor's side. Excuse
the personality, but you have the ap
pearance of a workman who thinks
for himselfâ whoâ -"
She got no farther, for something
in the man's face transformed her
into a picture of frozen dignity. Rip
ples of mirth seemed to be chasing
each other like little waves across his
quivering lips, while his eyes held a
hundred dancing smiles. Then sud
denly the lights went out and his face
was all humble, flattered gravity.
"I'll do my best, Miss," he replied;
"though as to having thought the
matter out for myself, I can't claim
that I have. Still, we â -us union men
â think labor ought to have a chance
and we're going to have it, too. We'll,
have capital on its knees to us yet!
We'll knock the props from under it,
and don't you forget it!"
With thinly concealed anxiety â the
anxiety of one who was playing a part
and who wondered if he had done
well â he watched the effect of his
words. But he need have had no
fear, for his listener had no standard
by which to judge him. She had lis- i
tened with slowly kindling eyes and
the general appearance of one com
ing into touch with the realities of life :
for the first time.
When at last the car halted at Co
lumbia she alighted with the convic
tion that the man in the blouse had
infused a new interest into life, while
he, as the car coasted down the hill
and into Harlem, stared blankly after
her disappearing figure for a second
and then burst into uncontrollable
laughter.
"The joke's on me," Axe confided to
himself ruefully. "It seems, then,
that blood doesn't always tell â and
that it does take the tailor to make
the man."
He glanced a( the address she had
scribbled on a slip of paper for him,
shrugged his shoulders and narrowed
Â¦his eyes thoughtfully, the outcome be
ing a decision that she needed the les
son. Besides, the corners of her mouth
were distracting! .
In the days that followed Miss Sin
clair was more and more amazed at
the intelligence, as well as the con
tradictions of John Clayton, electri
cian. His speech would flow on with
a smooth, elegance astonishing in a
man of his class; then, without warn
ing, break into the most ear splitting
errors.
"Hack-kneed phrases! Mere hack
kneed phrases!" he exclaimed fervent
ly in the midst of a discussion one day.
"You see, Miss, in your en-vy-ron
ment" â he accented the third syllable
stronglyâ" you can't see the things
that I see." Never by any chance did
he use her surname. Yet his manner
at times â in moments of self-forgetful
ness, she fancied â verged upon perfec
tion. Never in her life had she met
with such contradictions. And never
in her life, she mutely admitted to
herself at last, in a state of breathless
dismayâ never had she met a man so
entirely interesting.
Of himself he spoke but little, but
sometimes, in the very midst of some
deep question, he would catch a soft,
absent, woman-look in the eyes fixed
intently upon himâ a look that had to
do not with wealth, position or the
betterment of the working- classes, but
which made him grow strangely warm
and inwardly call himself a brute.
It was at a dinner party three
months after their first meeting that
the unmasking took place. One blind
ing flash of surprise when Mr. Harring
ton was presented to her, and then Miss
Sinclair was herself again.
"Well?" he murmured brazenly when
he found himself seated beside her at
the table.
"Pray, what is your real name, and,
if I may ask, do you regard life as a
bal masque?" Deftly she managed to
impart to the question tnat elusive
touch of insult, the use of which is one
of the most delicate arts that society
has to teach. But Harrington did not
wince.
"John Clayton Harrington, electri
cal engineer, who has a mind to know
street railways from the ground up,"
he . answered sturdily. At the answer
a sudden gladness leaped Into her eyes.
Her head was bent low, her voice
changed.
"Iâ I am glad. I should not want
you to b&r-inslncere!" (Copyright, 1904,

VIRGIL. KRELL OP NEW
YORK.
velopment to his father, John Krell,
who decorated the Missouri building,
and who made the New York building
one of the handsomest on the grounds,
says the New York World.
In various places and in divers poses
you may see the picture of little Virgil
on these buildings, done by the loving
hand of his father.
Since the little boy's birth the great
est care has been exercised in forming
the child's habits, in selecting his diet
and in having his baths at a certain
temperature. A sermon for mothers
might be preached on the result.
Every evening Virgil's father gives
him his bath and massage, and again
half an hour before retiring the child
is put through half an hour's exercise.
John Krell has not only been a father
of the boy but a drill master, a physi
cian, a playmate and a general monitor
as well.*
When the child was 3 months old his
father lifted him to the chandelier and
there the baby hung by his hands for
almost a minute.
This kind of exercise was continued
until he was 9 months old, when he
could be held by his feet and lifted
horizontally in the air with his body
perfectly rigid. He now performs many
athletic feats. \
He posed for the famous William
Dodge for decorations for the Majestic
Theater in Boston, Keith's Theater in
Philadelphia, the Empire Theater and
the Hotel Astor in New York.
To visitors at the New York building
in the World's Fair little Virgil proud
ly announces: "I am an American!
Hurrah for America and liberty!" To
emphasize this he waves a small silk
flag which he carries.
"In training my boy l have always
had him out early in the pure morn
ing air. There Is nothing better for a
child than this.
"I make him breathe deeply bo as to
fill his little lungs with it. This makes
his cheeks glow and his eyes sparkle.
"I send him to bed early, for I believe
that 'this saves doctor's bills and keeps
him healthy.
"I play with him every evening. We
have wrestling matches, tugs of war,
blind man's buff and many other
games that make the little folks grow
strong.
"I do not care to have him pose too
much. In fact,' I will not allow him to
pose at all unless his mother is present
to watch for any signs of fatigue.
"It is easy enough to raise a child
in a healthy, rational way if parents
would only take the trouble."
To' curb his wife's extravagant pro
pensities a citizen of Budapest is In
the habit of keeping her locked up In
a room of their, house except on Sun
day, when the shops are shut.

BAN RAFAEL, Nov. 18^-The trial of
the suit for damages of Catherine Han-
Inn against W. D. Bradbury was re
opened to-day with a resumption of
Bradbury's cross examination by Dis
trict Attorney Boyd. The examination
did not change the defendant's testi
mony in a material way. Dr. Thorn
ton was called to testify to the million
aire's health. Mrs. Allen, one of Brad
bury's relatives, testified that the wit
ness Qulgley had denied to her that
Bradbury had committed any offense.
The defense then closed.
In rebuttal District Attorney Boyd
called Mrs. J. J. Pierce and Mrs. W.
White, prominent society women of
Fruitvale, as witnesses. They' both tes
tified that Mrs. Hanifin's reputation In
that town is good. Georga Lund, the
postmaster; Dr. William Beckwlth,
William Rutherford, John Lelth and
George Fredericks all testified to the
same effect. The parents of Mrs. Han-
Inn also testified to their daughter's
good habits and conduct. Tha case
was then closed.
District Attorney Boyd mads tha
opening argument to tha Jury. Attor
ney Hosmer began the argument for
the defense and had not concluded
when the hour of adjournment arrived.
The case will be submitted to the Jury
.to-morrow.
Thanksgiving Town Talk.
Town Talk's Thanksgiving number, an
illustrated, sixty-page magazine, appeared
this week. It Is. one of the most credita
ble of the many fine achievements of the
enterprising publishers. A notable fea
ture of this issue Is "The Hidden Mel
ody," a powerful and artistic short Btory
of characteristic bohernian life In the
American metropolis. The editor haÂ»
discovered in the author, Oliver White,
an American Murger who has oaught the
right atmosphere and who is a master of
moods. His story pulsates with the fever
of discovery and Impromptu.- In this is
sue begins a series of eloquent open let
ters to men of mark. The first Is ad
dressed to Theodore Roosevelt. The
Saunterer tells of Prince Fushimi's
flight from the local Four Hundred. He
throws some sidelights on the Dolbeer
will contest, retails some breezy Paclflo-
Unlon Club gossip, divulges the name of
the Harmony candidate for Mayor, tells
of Mrs. Carolan's meeting with a Prin
cess and the snubbing of Mrs. Howard
Gould by Lillie Lawlor. There is also
much news in the Saunterer's pages of
people In politics. In literature and on
the stag?, and. throughout, the paper has
the true Thanksgiving; flavor, being filled
with topical sketches and witticisms.

Siskiyou County is using electric
power and the fact is locally considered
of sufficient significance to be the sub
ject of special comment in the news
papers of Shasta County. The Redding
Free Press says that tTie late rain
storms have been beneficial to the
<juartz mines of SisKiyou County in
furnishing a supply of water for the
batteries, although not sufficient for
placer and hydraulic power. Electri
city, however, supplies the place of
waterpower to a great extent, by car
rying currents long distances from
heavy power streams.
Among the Siskiycn prants to use
electric power is the Mount Vernon
quartz mill, on the divide between
Greenhorn and Cherry creeks. This
plant is running steadily on electric
power from the Siskiyou Electric Com
pany. If the fdow does ' not prevent
the mill will be able to run all win
ter.
The Bully Hill Company at Delamar,
Shasta County, has recently put in a
new electric hoist that Is run by power
furnished by the Northern California
Power Company. The shaft of the
Bully Hill mine, so reports the Redding
Free Press, will be sent down 1500 feet.
It is now Â£,70 feet deep.
According to the same authority
thirty stamps are now dropping at the
Fairview mine in Trinity County and
the new power is working satisfactori
ly. A new battery of Ten stamps has
been added. Another battery of ten
stamps is in view, so that forty stamps
will be the size of the milling plant in
a few months.
Attention is called by the Redding
Searchlight to the movements of the
Mountain Copper Company in reference
to its new smelting plant to be estab
lished in Contra Costa County. The
Searchlight says:
One of the signs of me times Is the
steady advancement in the use of elec
tric power in the mines of California.
LÂ«&rgre electric plants on the Mother
Lode have succeeded waterpower
plants and independence of operation
has followed. Electric power is doing
the work for the dredgers. In the
northern counties the ures of electri
city in mining are liberal. Coupled
with the processes to make profitable
low gTade ores, that formerly were dis
carded because there was no economi
cal way in which to get from them the
values that they held, and make profit,
the significance of electricity is more
apparent now than ever before, when
the future c-f California as a mining
State is considered.
A change has been made in the or
ders pertaining to mining lands In the
Klondike, under which quartz regula
tions have been amended. The right
Is reserved on all crown lands to grant
rights of way to Individuals or water
companies for the construction and
maintenance of works to convey water
for mining uses. In view of the general
interest in the Klondike the text of the
order by which the Council has effected
the changes is given In substance, as
follows:
Whereas, The regulations governing the dls
posal of the right to divert and use water for
mining purposes la the Yukon Territory, ap
proved by order of the Governor In council on
August 3. 1S9S, provided that the mining
recorder may grant the right to divert and
use water from any stream or lake, at any
part thereof, and the right of way through
and entry upon any mining ground for the
purpose of constructing ditches and flumes to
CGnvey such water; and.
Whereas, There is some doubt as to whether
under the provisions of the regulations above
quoted an officer of thÂ« crown baa the au
thority to grant any right of way through
and entry upon mining, lands for which a
crown grant has been Issued. If sueh crown
grant conveys the surface as well as the under
rights.
Therefore the Governor General In council
is pleas*! to order that section Mo ef tht
quartz mining regulations shall b* and the
Eame is hereby amended by adding the fol
lowing provisions thereto:
"And all such patents com ej tug the surÂ»
face as well as the under rights shall reserve
to the crown forever such right or rights of
way and of entry as may be required under
any regulations la that behalf now or here
after in force In connection with the construc
tion, maintenance and use of works for the
conveyance of water for use In mining opera
tions." :'âÂ¦"-"-'
While the mining dredges In Califor
nia are extending their field the dredg
ing process for the recovery of gold Is
doing good work in the Klonklde, ao
cording to the Yukon World of October
2a, which says:
Yesterday witnessed what was doubtless the
last eummer work in the way of mining to
be done in the Klondike this season. Ordinary
eluicing in open boxes ceased a week or two
ago. but the work of the dredge on discovery
on Bonanza and the steam shovel plant at
the mouth of Bear Creek continued without in
terruption until within the past twenty-four
hours, the water being turned off at Bear
Creek Friday evening and the fires under the
boilers of the dredge drawn last night.
"This season has beÂ«n the longest w* hare
ever enjoyed since we first began operating
in the Klondike." said J. Moore Elmer to a
World man, "and as successful, too, as we
could anticipate. We first started the dredge
digging May 5 and have continued without
irterruption until yesterday, October 22, mak
ing the season one of unusual length. The
work has been very satisfactory and beyond
ecme needed repairs that will be effected this
winter -wo are in position to begin again with
th* arrival of the first water in the spring.
"The Bear Creek proposition has also turned
out very well and with the shovels wÂ» have
handled a tremendous amount of dirt. The
greatest difficulty w e have had to contend
against at the latter point has been the water
which rues into the cut through the porous
strata of gravel direct from the Klondike in
such quantities that it has kept us busy pump
ing it out. Our pump will handle Â£000 gal
lons a minute and It has been kept going
at its fullest capacity. The cut will doubtless
fill this winter now that tha plant has been
shut down and It will be a tremendous task
to pump it out in the spring."
KLONDIKE IS DREDGING.
Throughout the Kooky Mountain region and
the J'aclflc Coast zinc ores occur tn greater
or Wv9 amount in many places, but the larger
portion of zinc ores exists as sulphide, and Is
combined with the sulphides of iron, copper
and lead. These ores, where the several sul
phides occur in finely disseminated crystals,
intimately intermixed, were, up to a short
time aÂ«o. undesirable, as the zino was not
wanted by the lead smelter, and the lead and
iron were not wanted by the zinc smelter. The
elt-ctco-piagmetic separator, however, has made
a clean separation of these several sulphides
;Â¦â¢-::'.-, and as a result the waste dumps of
several districts suddenly became valuable for
their zinc, lead and copper contents, besides
at once rendering profitable a large volume of
ore In i>lace in the mines. Under the new
conditions and the stimulus Â£lven the output
ct zinc by the demand for it, that metal has
I*Â»con:Â« an imiK^rtant factor in the mineral
output of several Western mining sections
Colorado and Utah have greatly increased
their zinc output, and in British Columbia
zinc hat become a noted feature of Its mineral
production. In neariy all cases the zinc ore*
are chipped hundreds of miles to smelters for
treatment, indicating that this class of ores
will bear a long-distance transportation charge
and a comparatively high reduction charge and
still afford a profit.
The Mining and Scientific Press con
siders a subject of coast importance in
the discussion of the zinc ores that
have been discovered on the Pacific
Coast. In part it says:

TILE WEALTH OF NOME.
The Nome Nugget estimates the sold
product of Nome for the season of 1904,
; not including the spring clean up, at
i $3,000,000. Some of the facts and fig
ures submitted are as follows:
Sinire June V.I last the Â»ura of $3,251,065 40
in s-j!d dust and bullion has been entered at
i the Nome custom* houst fur shipment to the
} outside. The first shipment amounted to
$2SS,<37 45. and was Bent out on June 13 on
j the Ftfamshlp Oregon. All of this amount was
I from the spring clean-up, which was $1,333,
000. liesides the cold dust entered at the
customs hou."Â»e for shipment, probably $100,000
was seat to the outside through the pcstofflca
prior to the promulgation of the order of the
| I'cstofrice Department, which virtually (hut
, eft th<? shipment of considerable amounts of
I dust throug-h the pestofflce. It is practically
j impossible to 6ccurÂ» accurate data aa to the
I gold production during the reason Just closing.
| It in probable that It will reach at least
I $.Â».0uft,ooo. or a total output for tha year, ln
[ eluding tiat realized from winter diggings,
' of a sum Blisrhily in excess of $4,000,000.
It is stated by those in a position to know
I that ut iti-.-i. $5<X>,OUO in dust and bullion is
1 jrwt to be shipped to the States. This will go
i out on the luFt steamers leaving Nome for tha
. season. The Nugget's estimate of the produc-
I lion of 18Â«3 was H.OOO.uOO, and the returns
from the United States mint practically veri
fied this estimate. The result of the present
season's work, in view of the existing circum
stances, the late spring and the lack of rain
at the beginning of the season, mining men
| say, is entirely satisfactory.

FOSTC3rS TRICK.
Hotr It Worked Wonders In One
Family.
"While I was a Tea and Coffee user
about eighteen months ago I happened
to pick up a piece of old newspaper and
eaw a letter tome one had written
about the gain In health by quitting
tea asd coffee and using Postum. and
as I was suffering with indigestion and
biliousness I decided perhaps Postum
would Ct my case, so I had Wife get a
package next day and make some.
"I had' been in the habit of taking
cold lunches with a bottle of cold tea,
but had become so bad I could not di-
gest them. In fact, I felt miserable after
every meaL Well, I quit t>oth tea and
coffee and after commencing to use
the Postum I began to feel better at
once and have not had a bilious spell
eince and nv more indigestion. I would
be more than glad to find something
that wouJd make me prosper financial-
ly as that piece of old newspaper did
physically.
"I know it was the cold tea that was
causing the trouble and the Postum
cured it.
"J want to tell you something about
my wife's condition:
"She had been a Ions time coffee
drinker and her feet were swollen so
badly that she could not have a shoe
o.n one of her feet at all and sometimes
not either of them, -ancr suffered ter-
ribly with constipation. She was treat-*
ed for kidney trouble, but the treat-
ment did her no good at all. and she
became perfectly discouraged. In a
6hcrt while after we began to use Pos-
tum and quit tea and coffee she began
to get better, and now she is as good,
healthy and fine * looking wife as you
will find, and I will leave those who
read this letter to Judge for themselves
what did It I want to say right here
we both are often asked what caused
my wife's health to Improve and we
never fail to tell them that it was us-
ing Postum in place of tea and coffee.
"We used to give our boy tea and cof-
fee and he came out witn a skin dis-
ease until his head was almost a mass
of scabs. We took away both tea and
coffee and gave him what we drank â
PoEtum â and shortly the trouble left
entirely, and all my children, like my
ivifÂ«Â» and myself, are healthy and
Ktrcmg. and the best friends of Postum
you ever saw."

The course of the San Francisco
Golf Club on the Presidio Reservation
is still used by many of the members,
and handicap tournaments are held on
public holidays. On Thanksgiving day
there will be a handicap competition,
the precise nature of which has not
been settled yet, but it will be against
"bogey."
On election day a goodly number of
members turned out for a handicap on
the Presidio course, the weather being
highly favorable. The contest was
over eighteen holes against "bogey."
Two prizes were offered, and were won
by H. C. Golcher and Hugh Blackman.
Twenty-seven players entered, and of
these, twenty returned their scores.

Henry Waddlngton, whose greyhound
Tom King won the rich John Grace
cup, was the most successful of the
invaders. In addition to. this event
Tom King placed other stakes to his
credit. Mr. Waddington is an orange
grower and will not be able to come
north again until February, when he
will try to capture the California plate.
Ed Janicke, another man from South
ern California, won the Junior Cham
pion stake with Eagle Bird. He also
had a clever performer in Mt. Eagle.
The last coursing meeting of the sea
son in the Middle West will be held
to-day at Blackwell, Oklahoma.
T. J. Cronin has been elected a mem
ber of the California Coursing Commit
tee, as a representative of the Inter
state Coursing Club. Mr. Cronin stands
for all that is high class and honest in
coursing. His great youngr dog Blaze,
which won the Futurity, is being rested
in the country. He had some severe
running and his owner was afraid to
take a chance in starting him again
until he has regained all his strength
and vitality.
The John Grace Cup stake furnished
the best coursing seen here in years.
The best eight dogn in the stake work
ed their way down through the early
running and clearly demonstrated their
class. The Judging by P. J. ReHiy and
the slipping by James Grace were flaw
less, pleasing winners and losers alike.
For the first time in years the betting
on the final was at even money. The
course proved the accuracy of the bet
tors' Judgment, as Tom King and Mc-
Vey reached the hare on even terms.
McVey secured the first turn by favor
of the hare.

Many good swimmers are being de
veloped by the South End Club, and it
is probable a mile race will take place

heavyweight championship between I.
Tuchler and John Ross.
James P. Foley of the South End
Rowing Club has received a letter from
E.'.O. Gloss of the Portland Rowing
Club,' the well-known single shell man.
Gloss is desirous of arranging a race
,for . the sculling championship of the
Pacific Coast with A. W. Pape, the
holder of the title, at any time between
April and June of next year. Gloss,
though handicapped by a poor boat,
gave Pape a hard race some seasons
ago, and. In a new shell Â¦ feels he can
do better than on that occasion.
Last Sunday there l was a race be
tween E. , Wolfe and A. Korn of the
South "End Rowing Club in*<outrigged
skiffs from the Mail dock to the club
house. The contest was close, Korn
leading by less than a clear length
when the. finishing-line was reached.
The members of the South End Row
ing Club are showing great activity in
aquatic matters. There is keen rivalry
between F. R. Berman's and Frank
Baker's crews, each wishing the honor
of representing the club in the junior
barge class at next season's regattas.
Two races have already been held be
tween the crews. On Sunday, the 6th
inst., Bergman's crew won. Last'Sun
day Baker's crew took first place. A
third trial will take place to-morrow.
The directors of the club intend to hold
contests' every fine Sunday. Light-re
freshments will be served at the club
house.
On Monday night at the quarters of
the Dolphin Boating Club, at the foot
of Hyde street," a meeting was held at
which representatives of the Dolphin,
Alameda and Ariel clubs were present
to discuss the formation of a new asso
ciation for oarsmen of this city and
neighborhood. A member of the South
End Rowing Club also attended the
meeting.
Temporary organization has been ef
fected, C. M. Farrell of the Dolphins
being elected chairman and A. Klhn
of the Alameda Club being secretary
pro tern. It was decided that the sec
retary should address letters to the
Olympic Boat Club ana the Stockton
Rowing Club, asking for- their co-oper
ation and membership, and to the Na
tional Association of Amateur Oars
men, asking for information in regard
to joining that body. The new organi
zation is to be named the Pacific Asso
ciation of Amateur Oarsmen and is in
tended ultimately to include all the
rowing clubs on the Pacific Coast. Two
committees have been appointed, one
to prepare a draft of a constitution and
by-laws and the other to reclassify the
oarsmen.
Last Sunday Commodore T. Jennings
of the Cr-rinthian Yacht Club, Port
Captain John T. Keefe and many boat
owners, w' h their craft stripped, were
on hand ready to pass into - winter
quarters in the lagoon behind Tiburon,
but the drawbridge was not raised.
It was claimed the proper tackle fc-r
raising the draw was not available,
but no difik llty has been experienced
in previous years on this score. J. R.
Savory and his crew worked the sloop
Juanita over from her Sauealito moor
ings to Belvedere Cove by the sure
but laborious process or Jayhawklng.
They found their labor had been in
vain. Arrangements will be made to
raise the bridge on some coming Sun
day.

All of the best players in the club
will be in the handicap event and there
should be some interesting matches. It
will probably be Champion MacGavin's
last appearance on the tennis courts.
He is going on a trip around the world
and his stay may be ten years In
length. He expects to locate in South
Africa, where ,he will have little time
for tennis.
The mixed doubles tournament will
be the largest ever held on the coast.
While there will not be as much class
to the event as there is at San Rafael
there will be many more teams than
ever participated in a similar event In
this city. Already nineteen teams have
entered and there will probably be
more by Wednesday night when the
entries close. The best teams are: Will
Allen and Miss Hazel Hotchkiss, C.
GrifflrTand Miss Bessie Valleau and C
Dunlap and Miss Ratcliffe.
To-morrow the handicap doubles
tournament which has occupied the at
tention of the park players for the last
two Sundays will be completed. In the
finals the Baker brothers playing from
"15 back of scratch" will be opposed to
Horace Mann and Robert Drolla, who
will receive odds of . "three-sixths."
These two youngsters have played clev
er tennis throughout the tournament
and the steady Bakers will have their
hands full winning.
The finals of the first class of the
Junior Club will be played to-day. Miles
HcLoughlin will meet Harold Getz. The
former won the first tournament, and
if he is successful in. his match with
Getz the racket and case, offered as first
prize will go to him permanently.
The directors of the California Club
decided Tuesday, night to offer two
three-time cups to replace the two won
by Long and Jan.es. They will not be
competed for until next month.
The teams entered in the mixed dou
bles tournament up to date are:
There will be but little tournament
play on the tennis courts this week,
but two affairs are scheduled for
Thanksgiving day. The California Club
will hold a handicap singles for men
while a mixed doubles will be played on
the park courts.
The club will offer a silver loving
cup to be competed for next year.. If
more than one singles tournament is
held the winners of the different
events will play off to see who is en
titled to the trophy.
. Y. C. Lawson offered to donate a
prize each year for an event to which
only men 70 years or over are eligible
to compete. -There are six or eight
members of the club over the three
score and .ten mark and they are all
clever bowlers. An event of this kind
will be a novel as well as an interest
ing one.
Nine new members have been ad
mitted to the club. The roster now
contains over 100 names. The green
committee reported the green to be in
excellent condition and were liberal
in their praise of John McLaren, who
is responsible for the green's condi
tion.
At the quarterly meeting of the San
Francisco Scottish Bowling Club new
officers were installed for 1905. Y. C.
Lawson, who has been the club's pres
ident since its inception two years
ago, declined the nomination for
president. His club mates were anx
ious to have him again at the helm,
but Mr. Lawson's home will be in New
York after the first of the year and
he was forced to retire. Mr. Lawson
has served the club faithfully and has
done more for Scottish bowling than
any man on the coast. The vote of
thanks tendered the retiring presi
dent was well earned by him in the
last two years.
The new leader of the club is H. L.
Tickner. John Reid is vice president
and 11. D. Colquhoun secretary-treas
urer.

North vs. South. As the Burlingame field is at Its best
just now; all the matches will be played there.
Burlingame will be given over to the poloists and to
the^owners of racing ponies next week, when the annual

Manager Coffroth' will have a talk
with Xelson" to learn his views regard
ing a match if he defeats Corbett. Un
less he can do . this decisively he
would not be considered a good draw
ing card.
Young Corbett believes that as Britt
has a. decision over him when ther
weighed 130 pounds at . 6 o'clock
the return match should be at the
same weight. Corbett admitted that
hM t thought he could beat Britt at any
weight, while Britt said he knew he
could beat Corbett at 130 pounds. He
wanted the extra weight in order to
make tho work of defeating him
eupier. -?. ; -.-Â¦;-
Jimmy Brltt and Young Corbett met
! by appointment at the Seal Rock House
at the beach yesterday to discuss a
match for December in case Corbett
defeats Nelson this month. A peppery
discussion followed and for a time it
seemed James "W. Coffroth, who was
present, would, be the only Bpectator
at a $30,000 fight.
Britt told Corbett he did not like him
.and the Denverite assured him there
was no man in America he would rath
er administer a thorough thrashing to
1 than the Californian. Aftes a heated
discussion Britt. as champion, dictated
that the weight be IS2 pounds at 6
o'clock or 133 pounds at the ringside.
Britt did not seem to see that this is a
ridiculous weight at which to defend
the featber-welght title, especially as
he was a veritable Shylock in his deal
ings with the unsavory Gans when the
lightweight championship was in
volved.
Britt insisted on the lowest weight
accepted as standard in this class by
boxing authorities. In his own case
he fixes a weight in which none of the
authorities will uphold him. There
must be some line of demarkation. If
be made Gans do 133 pounds for the
lightweight championship he can
hardly expect Corbett to do 133 pounds
and call it the featherweight .cham
pionship limit.
Five Scottish Hall directors were to
be elected. The following were elected:
A. M. MacPherson, D. D. McRae and
J. M. Duncan. , For the other two three
had a tie vote, R. Gratto, James Gorie
and J. E. McFarlane, , and another
election for them will be necessary.
The other officers elected were: First
chieftain, D. J. McFarland; second
chieftain. P. F. Finlay; third chieftain,
James H. Duncan; fourth chieftain, J.
W. Cameron: physician, Dr. J. A. J.
McDonald; club directors, R. McD.

The annual election of officers of the
Caledonian Club was held in Scottish
Hall last night.- The attendance was
larger than at any previous election for
many years, as there was a keen con
test between D. D. McRae and J. A.
McLeod'for the office of chief. The bal
loting resulted in the election of McRae
by a vote of 82 to 43, and on motion
of the defeated candidate the election
was made unanimous.

CALEDONIAN' CLUB HAS
ITS ANNUAL ELECTION
BRITT DISCUSSES
NEXT MATCH.
TWO'YEJfR'OLDS
WILL MEET.
Reports have come to Berkeley that
Stanford may lose her great coach.
Lar.agan, next season, it being said
hia football work haa interfered seri
ously with the duties he has to per
form as instructor at Belmont School,
so that he may be asked ttx give up the
coaching detail. Should this report be
correct the University of California
men believe there will be little discus
sion before it is decided to not renew
the agreement, which has been in force
three years, ' obliging, the universities
to use only graduate coaches. i >?Â¦>'.
"Hopper came and coached the team
this year at great personal sacrifice.
It is practlcaliy impossible for many
men to make such sacrifice as he dia,
or as must be made if a man coaches'
the team properly. We are accordingly
handicapped in the wc-rlc of turning
out a winning team.
"Stanford, naturally, is satisfied witb
Lanagan; its coach, who comes under
the category of a graduate coach,' al
though he did not, I believe, graduate
from Stanford. The University of Cal
ifornia, however, haa .the task oC se
curing a new coach an its hands and
cannot expect to see Hopper again sac
rifice his work and time to coach the
team. Whether professional coaches
will be employed is another matter,
which will not be decided until after
careful consideration has been given
the subject. Mr. Decoto, Everett Brown
and myself constitute the representa
tives of California on the committee of
six, which is to discuss the agreement
in January. Sir. Decoto is la Washing
ton, and until his return nothing will
be done about the matter.".
Assistant Manager Leo Bishop of the
varsity team said to-<iay: "We are
limited by this agreement to an expen
diture of not more than $300 for coach
ing expenses, and It is not possible to
get a man who is worth while to give
up his business or professional duties
to coach the team fc-r such a meager
compensation, which, of course, is in
tended merely to pay his expenses. *
BERKELEY, Nov. 18.â As a result
of the decisive defeat of the University
of California football team by Stan
ford a week ago, it is deemed likely
by those who give most attention to the
college sport here that the plan of us
ing graduate coaohes alone for the
team will be abandoned next year, and
that the Eastern field will be searched
carefully for a professional coach who
may assist the blue and gold to victwy
in the intercollegiate game.
The agreement which the University
of California has with Stanford, by
which only graduate coaches are to be
employed by the universities, expires
on December Â«1, 1904. On the fourth
Friday in January after that date a
committee of six men, three from, each
university, will meet at the Palace llo
tel in San Francisco to discuss the ad->
visabiiity of renewing the agreement
or abrogating it. The constitution of
the associated students of the Univer
sity of California provides that the
agreement shall be in force until De
cember 31, and thereafter until a new,
agreement is adopted. ."*
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. IS.
Stanford's new athletic field, on which
the intercollegiate athletic events are
to be played alternately, is to be start
ed at once. "W^rk will have to be
rushed, for the atnletic field, bleachers
and surrounding grounds -must be com
pleted in time for thp bJg football
game, which is to be played at Stan
ford next year. A survey has been
completed and' the plans submitted to
the board-of trustees of the university.
Active work will begin as soon as suit
able Dlans are accepted.
Stanford's athletic field will be much
more extensive than the football
grounds recently built at Berkeley. In
one corner will be the gridiron, with
bleachers, costing about $21,000. On
another side- a. drained baseball dia
mond is to be put in,, and in another
corner a four-lap track fol- spring ath
letics. The handball and basketball
courts are to be in the new gym
nasium. Tennis courts and a covered
track, to be used In wet weather, will
be added. When finished Stanford's
athletic field will cover about forty
acres of ground. Part of the expense
is to be borne by the students, who
have already raised a fund of $9000.
Sixteen Stanford football players,
Coach - C. â¢ D. Hauverman, Trainer
"Dad" Moulton and Treasurer "Dick"
Barrett will leave for Denver on Sun
day morning, where the cardinal
eleven is to play the University of
Colorado on Thanksgiving afternoon.
The Stanford varsity will not be the
strong team that defeated California
last week. Sprott, left tackle; Roose
velt, right guard, and Chalmers, right
halfback, will be left behind. Sprott
and Roosevelt remain because of pres
sure of work. The lineup of the team
Â¦will be: Captain Clark, left end; Hor
ton, left tackle; Thompson, left guard;
Hyde, center; Van Sickle, right guard;
Shields, right tackle; West, right end;
Bansbach* quarter; Trowbridge, right
half; Dole, left half: Weller, fullback.
Substitutes': Stott, Hazelwood. Crowe,
Butterfleld. and S. B. Thompson.
Noticeable interest has been evinced
by oil men over the anonuncement
yesterday of the incorporation of a
company for the purpose of introduc
ing rifled pipes, by which means it is
expected to facilitate the flow of tru?
sluggish crude petroleum in' its trans
mission to shipping points. The
statement that John D. Isaacs of the
engineering department of the South
ern Pacific Company was the inventor
of the new arrangement made him the
recipient of many congratulations.
Isaacs, however, refused to claim thi
entire credit for the invention, ex
plaining that Etickner Speed of
Berkeley, who is also an engineer in
the employ -of the Southern Pacific
Company, should justly share in any
credit due the invention, inasmuch as
Speed had worked jointly with him in
perfecting the project.
Credit for the Valuable Project â¢ Is

The banner event of the day was the
relay race between two artillery and
two cavalry teams. Civilians looking
at It held their breath fearing that
some of those active, reckless troopers
who mounted while their horses were in
a gallop and dismounted when the ani
mals were running. like the wind would
certainly break their necks. The race
went to the cavalry men, of course. The
gunners were a trifle slow in the starts,
while the troopers were â well as quick
as United States cavalry men are
known to be.
The rough riding exhibition was ex
actly what the name indicates. The
troopers did stunts that would make a
circus acrobat look foolish. They rode
with The recklessness of a cowboy or a
Cossack of the Don. Leaping to the
backs of galloping steeds, vaulting
over the backs of two running horses,
standing up on a running horse, these
Mere a few of the feats accomplished,
not a spill nor a misstep was made.
The light artillery made good the re
mark made by a well-known general.
"There is nothing so pretty as a field
battery in action." With a/jingling of
chains and a rumbling of wheels the
gun3 rolled into the field with the
horses on a gallon. A few notes -on the
bugle and they turned unlimbering in
an instant. Breech blocks were opened
with clickings and loads inserted. There
was^a hurried scampering back of the
gunners and then the crash of the can
nons. In another second it seemed the
guns were limbered and whirled to an
other part of the field.
Â» The finals of the hurdle races and the
100 and 220 yard dashes were run off In
remarkably good .time. Corporal Hunt
proved himself a Mercury in bras3 but
tons and blue, taking two first places
and one second in these events. He
rolled up the score of the Fifteenth In
fantry so that it seems that organiza
tion- has the athletic pennant
cinched. The baseball game between
the Presidio boys- and the Thirteenth
Infantry team was a warm contest till
the ninth inning. Then the Presidio
stickers located Pitcher Trueston of the
Thirteenth. When the smoke of battle
cleared the score read 4 to 0 for the
Presidio. The results:
100-yard dash: Final lieat â Won fcy Serjeant
Rice. Twenty-ninth Company, Coast Artillery:
Corporal Hunt Sixty-flrth Company. Coast
Artillery, second; Private Steward. Company
K. Fifteenth Infantry, third. Time, 10 2-5
aeconda.
The dashing cavalry men and the ar
tillery men divided the attention at the
department athletic contests yesterday
at the Presidio. The horses of the post
were entered into the games and they
seemed to catch the spirit of the affair.

Although Champion Jeffries, who is
now at Spokane, Wash., with his theat
rical company, denies, that he has
changed his mind and has withdrawn
the color line, his intimates, in this city
assert that he is willing to fight Jack
Johnson, who isthe only man now be
fore the public witlv any claim on â¢ a
match" with the big fellow.'
While Jeffries was performing at the
Central Theater some weeks since ef
forts were made to match,- him with
Johnson. He finally gave this as his
ultimatum: "I will fight Jack John
son if he will agree that the winner
shall take all the fighters' share of the
purse, and he must also put up $2500
as. a. side, bet."
Jeffries thought. Johnson wanted to
make a match with him expecting that
the loser's end would, be larger than
he could hope lo secure from beating
some second raters. ..To make Johnson
show his hand he first insisted oh "a
510,000 side bet, but \yas finally con
vinced that one of $2!>00 would show
Johnson meant business. Johnson and
his advisers have had this under con
sideration and it is asserted the men
will surely meet early next year.
Johnson is the'best man Jeffries has
met since Sharkey was fn his prime.
He is as big as the champion, is a clev
er boxer and a hard hitter. His game
ness has never been questioned.

Eusrene Hildebrand. who from a
"hush" rider became the premier rider
of the country in a single season, was
kept busy shaking hands with old
friends nt the track yesterday. "Hildy"
rod<? 270 * winners on the Eastern tracks
'Sunns the past seiison and next year
Â¦i!l be seen in the colors of Harry
Payne Whitney at Â« large salary. He
will have the .mount on Stroller in the
lÂ»nndi<-an this afternoon. Hildebrand
is a California product and it took the
Eastern turn scribes and critics sev
eral weeks to discover that the young
rter could ride. His stay here will bs
limited, as he is under contract to do
Uut ridins: for JoÂ»? Teajrer's i table at
the Los AnjreK-s meeting:.
"Jakie" Jones appears to be regain
ing his old form. He piloted two win
ners yesterday.
Harry Stover always said he would
never permit a boy wearing syjrs to
ride Kenilworth. The old brown horse
has grown so cunning of late that Har
ry changed his mind and Herbert tried
dull steels on the sprinter yest^-rday
without working much improvement.
Some useful pieces of horseflesh will
be sold at public auction in the pad
dock to-day. "'Butch 1 ' Fisher will dis
pose of F. E. Shaw. The Cure and
Gottlieben. Phaon, Jerusha and Tou
pee, the latter three the property of
Bob McGibben, will pass under the
hammer. Whoa Bill will also be led
into the rinjr.
barney Winter, an English layer of
odd?, is here on a pleasure trip.
The weights for the Thanksgiving
handicap will be issued on Monday
I.C'Xt.
Flaneur again disappointed his ad
mirers, this time in the seven furlong
Ff Ring run. for which the brown geld
ing ruled a pronounced choice. While
Fullivan, who had the mount on the
lirst choice, was deciding which route
lie would travel, "Kerry Patch" Mc
laughlin on the 20 to 1 shot Ripper
stole a long lead over the field. Flan
cur could not lessen the intervening
daylight and the outsider galloped in
lirst by more than half a dozen lengths.
Meistersinger, about which there was
considerable action, finished in the
show.
JCo" dividends were received by the
baxHTers of Briers, the 7 to 20 choice
for the last, a mile run, decided under
yelling conditions. :>he had Davis on
her back and at no time mingled witli
the leaders. After shaking off old
Vulcain. Brennus, ridden by Bell, and
6 to 1. proved an easy winner. Forty
tc one was laid against Vulcain. which
vas second. Rene at like odds took
The show position.
TRACK NOTES.
"Sharkey" Butler, a colored lad,
landed Northwest a winner of the mile
and fifty-yard selling affair, leading
out Red Cross Nurse a head with W.
Davis in the saddle. The latter's odds
v.*re hammered down from 8 to 3,
and the winner must have been days
;md days the best. Davis made all the
running with Red Cross Nurse. Had
lie taken the rail in the run home he
would most likely have cleaned up.
At the start Northwest stumbled and
Butler decided on going the shortest
way round. Davis* mount tired some
an the wire was approached and as he
had neither whip nor steels to resort
to, the first choice earned the decision
by a scant head. Stunts quit early,
Â»-hile Hermc-ncia appeared sore and
unfit.
l'LANEUR FAILS BACKERS.
This was followed by the win of an
other short -priced one. Squire Johnson
seemingly outclassed the other starters
in the colt race at five and a half fur
longs, and the layers were compelled to
rub 1 to 2. Fortunately for the layers
Knapp, who had the mount on the fa
vorite, beat his field away from the
barrier a couple of lengths. At the end
he was kept busy beating out Phalanx
with Helgesen up, A. Muskoday ran
third.
Honiton, the daughter of Ormonde,
owned by P. Ryan, made short work of
her field in the six-furlong handicap
yesterday at Oakland. The brown mare
Mas asked to pick ud 112 pounds and
Â¦Â«ith Ja.kie Jones in the pilot-house
wont to the post an odds on favorite.
She brushed off the other five start-
soon after Dick Dwyer sprung the
barrier, vinning all the way. Under
punishment Albula was brought from
behind by Helgesen, defeating the
weary Captain Forsee for the place.
Had it not been for the two "eagle
birds," Ripper and Brennus, the book
makers would have had an unpleasant
session. The first four favorites went
down the line, the different cashiers
being kept busy paying off. Finally
Flaneur and Briers failed *o make
connections, which relieved the tension
somewhat. The track was again heavy.
Magrane, the colt Bookmaker and
Owner Billy Magrane named after him
self, captured the introductory sprint
for maiden three-year-olds. The brown
fellow closed a 1 to 2 chance and won
in hollow fashion. Darksome, a 10 to 1
Fhot, with Knapp in the saddle, took
the place from Miss May Bowdish.

many a man have been saved from wreck by a
word from the lips of this wonderful man; in
the great game of business men have staked
their all on the dicta of Professor Henry Ells-
mere and won. Friends long separated have
been reunited through his instrumentality. The
proverbial "slip 'twixt the cup and the Up'
has been - averted In thousands of Instances
through his ability to read the future. Ro-
mances without number have ended happily
and the altar fires of love burn In countless
homes to-day because of Professor Henry Ells-
mere's profound understanding of human des-
tiny. Obscure diseases* have been located by
his psychic diagnosis and owe their cure to
his thorough knowledge of the patient's special
needs.

SACRAMENTO. Nov. 18.â Lieutenant
Governor Alden Anderson, who has
been filling the executive chair during
the absence of Governor Pardee from
the State, listened to a lengthy argu
ment to-day In the matter of the war
rant for the requisition of George E.
Letcher of San Jose, who Is wanted in
Williams County, Ohio, upon a charge
of arson. Letcher was represented by
several attorneys from San Francisco,
who put up such a vigorous fight
against the honoring of the requisition
that Acting Governor Anderson post
poned action in the matter for two
weeks.
A requisition properly drawn up was
presented to the Acting Governor by
Officers Garrett Fox and C. E. Goodell
of Ohio. The papers stated that Letcher
had been indicted by the Grand Jury
of Williams County for the crime of
arson committed on January 4, 18S4.
Letcher resisted the requisition on the
ground that he was not in Ohio on the
date stated.
Vigorous Opposition to Warrant for
Requisition for Alleged Incendiary
Causes Postponed.

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
Special Officer Pickell had followed
the murderers nearly four blocks, when
they stopped near IÂ«afayette and Third
streets and shot him through' the
body. The bullet entered his abdomen
and passed out near the backbone.
Having fired several more shots and
effectively intimidated the pursuing
crowd, the fugitives escaped in the di
rection of the railroad yards that He
west of the Michigan Central and Union
depots.
DKTROIT, Nov. 18. â Patrolman John
Daley was shot down and killed about
midnight by one of two burglars, whom
he detected at work In the rear of Wil
liam Dledrich's store at 75 Michigan
avenue, and Herbert II. Pickell, a spe
cial officer for the Michigan Central
Railroad, was shot through the abdo
men and probably fatally Injured when
he ran to the policeman's assistance.
The murder occurred in tho heart of
the business district of Detroit in an
alley back of the corner of Michigan
avenue and Wayne street.
Patrolman Daley's revolver waa
found within a few feet of the store
window, which the burglars had partly
opened. Daley had evidently turned to
follow his assailants after he had re
ceived a mortal wound, as he fell on
his face a few yards off In the direction
which his assailants had taken.
One Killed and the Other
Seriously Injured in the
Business Part of Detroit
OFFICERS SHOT
BY BURGLARS
The Brownies were quick to land
on the offerings of Brother Joe for a
pair of runs in the initial spasm. The
Seals held aloof till the fourth, when
a series of hits, a boot by Runkle and
a couple of sacrifices let them have a
run. Cap Irwin tied it up in the
eighth by walking, stealing and ar
riving on Waldron's double over third.
Corbett walked Frary in the ninth.
Gorton let the next ball go through
him, sending Frary. to second. Spen
cer lined a slow one to Brother Joe.
He recklessly threw the ball out into
left field while trying to catch Frary
off third arid the latter came around
the turn with the one that looked like
a winner.
When Wheeler came up in the ninth
to take a wallop at the ball in place
of Gochnauer the fans felt glad.
Their gladness was transformed into
frenzy when little Georgie soaked the
first ball pitched out to the farthest
corner of the lot for a three-bagger.
Gorton flew out to Frary. Starkells
grew so elated that he executed a wild
pitch and let Wheeler shoot in. The
score:
There was too much dusk in the
vicinity of Recreation Park yesterday
afternoon after the ninth inning to
permit of any more baseball, so Um
pire Christie wisely bade the tossers
go to dinner and the fans to do like
wise. Both teams had amassed three
runs .and both were anxious to quit
when the umpire gave them the office.
There were several incidents of the
battle which do not happen every day
In ball games. For instance, Joe
Corbett winged eleven Brownies out
on strikes and then did the best he
could to toss the game away In the
ninth spasm. Wheeler came to the
rescue in the ninth with a great three
bagger and scored the run that cre
ated a deadlock when Starkells com
mitted a rank wild pitch.

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
RENO, Nov. 18.â Barney 'Oldfleld. the
automobiliat. came within three Inches
of losing his life on the Southern Pa
clflc Railroad reservation here to
night. He attempted to cross in front
of an approaching train which was
running at full speed. He was in his
large touring car. Charles Short and
Mart Johnson were riding with him.
The rider saw the train coming, but
decided to beat it. He pulled the
throttle of the machine wide open and
made a dash for the track. The next
moment the train was apparently upon
him. The sidewalk was lined with
spectators anxious to set a glimpse of
the famous automobilist. It seemed
certain death for the riders. Brave
hearted men turned their faces to hide
the horror of the awful sight.
But fortune was with Barney. The
machine passed over the track and out
of danger, the steam chest Just graz
ing the rear end of the automobile.
Oldfleld was not in the least nervous
when seen immediately afterward.
"Oh, it waa nothing much," he said. "I
knew I could beat the engine for I
have done It before."

from Constantinople says negotiations have

Rabbi Nieto delivered an interesting
sermon last night at Congregation
Sherith Israel on-"Ezekiel,' in which
he told of his candor and power and
remarkable leadership. The rabbi said
that Ezekiel was not of the stock that
told the people what pleased them
most, but he took the course which
appeared"to him the right one. He
was fearless and rebuked all that was
corrupt.
Delivers Interesting Sermon.

French, German, Mission, Security and
D. O. Mills National banks and a joint
bid will be submitted for a portion of
the issue aggregating $2,099,800. divided

public library site in the neighborhood
of Van Ness avenue and Fulton street,
$739,800; for Golden Gate Park and Pre
sidio extension. $328,000; for a chil
dren's playground, $740,000.
It was explained that some of the
banks would want the bonds on Jan
uary ]5, 1905, while others would want
them at a later date in the event that
they are successful bidders. The banks
are desirous of escaping payment of
taxe3 in March on the money they are
reserving for the purchase of the bonds.
The committee decided to recommend
in a report that the board agree to de
liver the bonds or any part Â»pf them
on or after January 1G, 1905, upon five
days' notice being given to the board.
I It was deemed advisable that clean
cut bids be filed rather than compel the
| bidders to incorporate a condition as to
when the bonds shall be delivered. It
was also stipulated that all the bonds
bid upon must be taken by the success
ful bidders and be delivered before
June 30, 1905.
The committee recommended that the
City Attorney be directed to begin con
demnation proceedings for' the acquisi
tion of the various lands involved in
the bids of the syndicate. The Public
Library Trustees will be asked to rec
ommend a site for the new library in
order that similar proceedings may be
begun.

Chief Clerk Stevens Is Out.
Considerable surprise was expressed
among the employes of the Southern
Pacific Company yesterday when it
became known that W. H. Stevens,
for many' years chief clerk in the
ticket auditing department of the
company, had been relieved of his du
ties. Accompanying the news of
Stevens' dismissal was the announce
ment that C. P. Warren, who has been
in the employ of the railroad company
for twenty years, had been appointed
to succeed him.
With simple ritual service the re

If any doubt has ever existed in the
minds of John Murdock's employers
regarding his integrity It was dispelled
yesterday afternoon. Murdock is the
driver of the Occidental Hotel bus, a
position he has held for a number of
months. Shortly after the noon hour
yesterday he entered the lobby of the
hotel and walking over to a desk he
discovered a big wallet lying upon it,
and with the curiosity that is natural
to all men he opened the red leather
case, which he discovered was filled
â¢with greenbacks. Murdock promptly
turned the -wallet over to Manager
Hill of the hotel and the latter pro
ceeded to count the currency, which
amounted in all to $1030. Inclosed
with the fresh looking bills was a let
ter of credit which was the means of
establishing the identity of the owner
in the person of A.' C. Stepany, an
Englishman living in Los Angeles.
Stepany was a guest at the hotel over
night and departed for Sacramento on
the 10 o'clock train yesterday morn-
Ing. It Is supposed that while ar
ranging for the checking of his bag
gage he laid his wallet on the top of
the desk and went off without it. As
he left the hotel about 9:30 in the
morning the wallet must have been
lying exposed to view on the desk for
several hours until Murdock found it.
The hotel manager telegraphed Ste
pany that his wallet had been 5 found
and the owner promptly sent Instruc
tions to have it expressed to him at
Sacramento.

E. H. Harriman is preparing to ex
pend $3,000,000 during the coming
year In improving his railroad lines
in Oregon. One of the first improve
ments that will be undertaken will be
the relaying of eighty-pound rails on
the Southern Pacific line north of
Ashland for a distance of 148 miles.
This work, exclusive of ties, will, ac
cording to the engineers' estimates,
cost about $715,000. Another $110,
000 Is to be spent in reballasting por
tions of the tracks between Ashland
and Portland, and $70,000 is to be
used In reballasting the tracks of the
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany between Portland and Hunting
ton, a distance of about seventy-six
miles.
Other construction work to be paid
out of the $3,000,000, appropriation
will include the building and repairing
of bridges along the Southern Pacific
line in Oregon, which will cost In the
neighborhood of $470,000, and for
similar work along the Oregon Rail
road and Navigation Company's lines
the sum of $406,000 is to be used. For
a number of months the Southern Pa
cific Company has had a large force
of men engaged in the canyons of
Northern California and Southern
Oregon filling: in the deep gaps, for
which millions of yards of material
has been used. It is proposud that
this work shall continue during the
coming year until the canyons have
been filled in and the company '.a af
forded an opportunity to abandon the
high trestles. The Harriman syndi
cate is already engaged In replacing
the old wooden trestles on both the
northern portion of the Southern Pa
cific and along the Oregon Railroad
and Navigation Company with modern
steel structures and the work will
continue through the coming year.
These many improvements. It 13 es
timated, will cost about $1,761,000,
which will leave $1,239,000 of the
$3,000,000 appropriation to be used
on other improvements along the
northern lines of the big transcontin
ental svstem. .

The defendant's attorneys objected
and after argument the Judge sustained
the objection. The District Attorney
was allowed till to-day to file counter
affidavits and the Grand Jury was ex
cused from further attendance till Mon
day morning. Â»
"Well, then," Â£aid Byington, "we will
ask leave to put the defendant on the
stand to cross-examine him on his af
fidavit."
The technical flght made by Joseph
Rebstock to quash the Indictment
against him for violating the election
law by refusing: to administer the oath
to a voter whose vote was challenged
at the primary election while he was
acting as an inspector at a polling
booth opposite the Almahouse was con
tinued before Judge Lawlor yesterday.
The members of the Grand Jury who
had been subpenaed as witnesses were
present and ready to testify.
The argument on the motion was be
gun on Wednesday and continued yes
terday.' The point at issue was as to
whether the defense had the right to
file affidavits on information and be
lief as to the action of the Grand Jury
prior to the filing of the indictment.
The attorneys for the defendant quoted
a case in Xew York, where it was held
that such affidavits were permissible.
The Judge said that while he had
some misgiving as to the soundness of
the decision, he would like to hear
from the District Attorney on the point.
District Attorney Byington argued
that if affidavits were made on hearsay
testimony they would be clearly not
permissible. He admitted that he had
been unable to find any decision on that
point in this State.
The Judge thought In view of the
New York decision he must assume
that the practice of filing affidavits on
information and belief was valid.
Suits for divorce were filed by Adessa
Walker against James Walker, deser
tion; Clara Ellis against William Ellis,
desertion and neglect; George J. Bless
ing against Flora Blessing, desertion.
The Blessings were married in 1877 and
have three children over 20 years old.
Judge Seawell granted a divorce .to
Lucretia Flower from Theron Flower,
having taken the case under submis
sion on Thursday. Judge Graham
granted a divorce to Caroline Baum
back from Bernard Baumback for de
sertion.
Judge Graham yesterday granted a di
vorce to Jennie Clyde Harner from W".
B. Harner, until lately superintendent
of the Southern Pacific's commissary
department. Mrs. Harner charged
cruelty and Harner made counter
charges of the same purport. He, how
ever, did not press his side of the suit.
They were married at Denver in Au
gust, 1900. The wife said her husband
slapped her face in his office, before
strangers and complained of her atten
tion to her pet dog, which he poisoned.
He had a habit, too, she declared, of
arousing: her jealousy by talking of his
affairs with other women. Mrs. Harner
was corroborated by Mrs. Ellen Dibble.
The decree, with 525 a month alimony,
was granted.
A suit for divorce was filed yester
day against Joseph Pommer, dealer in
ladies' furnishings at 729 Larkin street,
by his wife, Eva, whom he married in
1S87. She accuses him or cruelty and
penuriousness. He had a habit of
throwing her ten dollars a week allow
ance at her feet, and on an occasion
when she bought an inexpensive dress
and asked him to pay for it he flew into
a rage and abused her in public. His
business, she says, is worth $6000 and
produces an income of $250 a month.
Besides this he has $1100 in cash and
$2000 in bonds. She asks for $100 ali
mony and $250 fees. They have two
children.
A few weeks ago Lola de Laica sued
Alfonso de Luca for divorce on the
ground of cruelty. In a cross com
plaint filed yesterday he makes a like
charge against her. When they mar
ried, he says, she represented that she
was a widow without children. After
the wedding he heard that she had a
husband and child living in Uexico. He
asked her for a proof of her widow
hood and she abused him. Then he
threatened to have the union set aside
and she threatened him with a razor
and struck him and told him to "look
out for her," because she had Indian
blood in her veins.
