ST. PETERSBURG, July 21.â The
press has been informed that Emperor
Nicholas, In an Interview with Count
Lamsdorff, the Foreign Minister, ex
pressed his displeasure at the turn
events had taken and at the possibility
of complications with Great Britain,
arising out of the detention of British
ships by the Russian volunteer fleet
steamships in the Red Sea. This pa
cific attitude, if the report be correct,
will doubtless lead to an Immediate and
amicable adjustment of the difficulties.
The news that Great Britain has de
livered to Russia a protest against the
capture of the Peninsular and Oriental
steamship Malacca, In terms which are
believed to be almost tantamount to a
demand j for the immediate release of
the vessel, as well as a general pro
test against the action of the Russian
volunteer fleet steamships in stopping
merchantmen in the Red Sea, was not
generally known here to-night, but
this morning's editorial broadside from
the London newspapers, reprinted here
this afternoon, was a sufficient warn

and the public became greatly excited.

PARIS, July 20.â The text of Foreign
Minister Delcasse's note to the Vatican
was communicated to the Council of
Ministers to-day. It creates a decisive
issue, asking for the withdrawal of
the letters by which the Vatican called
for the resignations of the Bishops
of Laval and Dijon. Otherwise all re
lations between France and the Vati
can will be broken off.
A similar notification was communi
cated to the papal nuncio here. ' The
Vatican's answer has not yet been re
ceived. It is expected that the ques
tion will be carefully considered be
fore a reply is given. Therefore the
Council does not expect a determination
of the issue before August. The offi
cials incline to the belief that a rupture
is Inevitable, as unofficial advices from
Rome indicate that the Vatican does
not intend to comply with the request
The Journal des Debats character
izes the note as an ultimatum and says
that unless entire satisfaction is given
a complete rupture will follow imme
diately, the French Embassy to the
Vatican being withdrawn simultane
ously with the delivery of the pass
ports to the nuncio.
"The French Government asks for
the withdrawal pure and simple of the
letters the Vatican addressed to the
Bishops of Laval and Dijon, which are
considered to be a breach of the con
cordat, as France had not previously
been consulted relative to the dismissal
of the Bishops. In default of compli
ance the Holy See is advised that the
pontifical nuncio at Paris will receive
his passports and that relations will
be severed."

resignations of the Bishops.
The contents of Delcasse's note are
said to be as follows:

When the penitentiary was reached
Morales told the whole story. He stated
that at Fernando station four of his
friends were to have boarded the train
and between there and Newhall they
hoped to rescue him. kill the officers
and escape to the range of mountains
and gradually work their way to the
Mexican border. To convince the of
ficers of the truth of his statement he
told them they would find a large knife
in his cell in the Jail here. The knife
was found the next day, and with it
was a package of pepper to be used if
necessary In blinding any person who
interfered. Morales now admits that
there is no hope for him, and he has
gone to the extent of telling who the
men are who Intended to rescue him,
but their names have not been made
public.
Last Tuesday was the time set for
the murderous programme, but owing
to the fact that one of the deputies
wanted to go deer hunting Sheriff
White consented to a change in the
usual order of things, and Morales was
started for San Quentin last Saturday.
He was called out of his ceil suddenly
and without being given an opportu
nity to return there was prepared for
the trip and sent north. It was noticed
that he seemed unusually sullen and he
was closely watched. He was accom
panied by another felon and the two
were handcuffed together throughout
the Journey.

his name a terror on the Mexican bor

tiary had been delayed by appeal to
the Supreme Court, but finally he de
cided to dismiss the appeal and serve
the rest of his days in prison. It Is
customary for the Sheriff to send con
victed criminals north on Tuesday, and
Morales supposed this rule would be
followed in his case. With a number
of friends, almost as desperate as him
self, he conspired to secure his release
by killing the officers who he thought
would have him in charge.
The plan was to have some of his
friends board the train north of the
citj*. enter the car where he was, sup
ply him with a revolver and at the
same time open fire on the officers.
LOS ANGELES, July 20.â The mer
est accident and what was considered
an unimportant change in a programme
outlined by Sheriff White for one of his
deputies, prevented the killing of two
members of the Sheriff's force and the
release of probably the most desperate

in years.

Insulting treatment of American rep

Government's requests by Turkey are
revealed in correspondence between
the State Department and Minister
Leishman at Constantinople, just

Dispatches from Leishman to the

compelled to wait for hours to gain an

talking business with the Sultan, who
was said to be too busy with other

which the Minister desired to press.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The agreement reached at to-night's
conference is practically the same as
the proposition made last Saturday to
the packers by Donnelly. The only
difference : is that in Saturday's com
munication Donnelly insisted that the
strikers be taken back to work within
seven days; This the packers refused,
although they - accepted every other de
mand made by Donnelly. When, the
men return to work it will be under
exactly the same , conditions as pre
vailed before the strike was declared,
with' the exception; that* the question
of a wage scale will be decided by
Arbitration.
DONNELLY YIELDS A POINT.
The agreement entered into between
the representatives of the packers and
strikers follows:
"Wages and working conditions of
all employes now on strike to be sub
mitted to arbitration, each party to
this agreement having the privilege of
bringing, before the arbitrators for de
cision any. question, of wages or con
ditions or any other grievance they
may have, and both to abide by the
decision of the arbitrators; the pack
ing companies signing this agreement
to re-engage all employes now out as
fast as possible, without discrimina
tion, employes to return to work at the
wages received when going on , strike
pending the decision of the arbitrators;
arbitrators to consist of three practical
packing house men to be selected as
follows: One representative of the
packing house companies; one repre
sentative of the Amalgamated Meat
Cutters and Butcher Workmen of
North America; these two to select a
third member."
CHICAGO, July 20.â The Btrike of
packing-house employes, begun nine
days ago and which has demoralized
the packing Industry, was settled here
to-night at a conference between rep
resentatives of the packers, the officials
of the Meat Cutters' Union and repre
sentatives of all the alUed trades .em
ployed at the stockyards. v The contro
versy will be submitted to, a board
of arbitration, both aides agreeing to
abide by whatever decision this board
may reach. Pending the decision the
men will be taken back to work as
rapidly as possible by the packers, and
it is agreed by the packers that all the
old employes are to be reinstated with
in forty-five days from the date work is
resumed. If any of the former em
ployes are still unemployed at the expi
ration of that time such persons are to
have the privilege of submitting their
cause to the arbitration board for set
tlement. ?
The strikers will return to work as
soon as they can be notified of the
peaceable adjustment of the trouble,
and it is expected that by Friday
morning everything will be in normal
shape at all the plants in the different
cities where the employes were on
strike. A half-hour after the decision
had been reached to-night to arbitrate
M. J. Donnelly, the strike leader, had
got into communication by long-dis
tance telephone with the leaders of the
strikers 'in outside cities and had noti
fied them that a satisfactory settle
ment had been reached and directed
the strikers to return to work as soon
as possible.
ALLIED CRAFTS BRING PEACE.
The settlement was brought about
by the allied crafts at the stockyards,
who would have become involved in
the controversy had it continued much
longer. The representatives of these
unions, which embrace about 14,000
men, got together yesterday and sent
a final appeal to the packers, asking
for a three-sided conference to-day In
a final effort to arrange some sort of
agreement. This appeal received a
favorable response and to-day's con
ference was the result.

It is probably the purpose of Ad

Yokohama and generally create a
panic among the population In order
to compel Rear Admiral Togo to re

The idea that Bezobrazoff would seri

however, rejected, owing: to the danger

The Gaelic's Japanese freight is val

trical supplies and canned goods.
The Korea's cargo for Japan is val

The reported arrival in the Pacific
of the Czar's commerce destroyers has
ruffled the calm, however, and the
notification from St- Peetersburg that
the Russian ships will devote their
attention to American and other ves
sels carrying merchandise to Japan
came as a shock yesterday to shippers
and shipowners.
The big liner Korea of the Pacific
Mail Company's fleet and the Gaelic,
chartered 1 from the White Star Line
of Liverpool by the Occidental and
Oriental Steamship Company, are the
only steamships now on the way from
this port to Japan.
The Mongolia will leave here July 29
and August 1 the Japanese liner Amer
ica Maru is scheduled to sail. The
Mongolia will carry â¢ some flour and
machinery for Japan. The America
Maru will not need anytning but the
Japanese flag that floats over her stern
to arouse interest in Russian naval
circles.
Both the Korea and the Gaelic have
in their holds large shipments of mer
chandise for Japan and if either is
overhauled by the Russians, seizure is
a certainty, as the nature of much of
the cargo brings it nearly enough with
in the classification "contraband" to
justify the Russians in holding the
ships and submitting the question to a
"prize" court.
Russia's -aggressive attention to Ja
pan-bound liners, as evidenced by re
cent seizures of foreign vessels passing
through the Suez -canal, has aroused
in the local commercial world renewed
interest In the Russian-Japanese war.
As long as the ships of the Russian
navy were bottled up. at Port Arthur
and frozen in at Vladivostok the prob
lem of continuing commercial deal
ingrs with Japan was simple. The war
rate of insurance was not excessive,
Japan's necessity was great and since
the war began an uninterrupted stream
of merchandise has ,h>en flowing across
the. Pacific to the island kingdom.
Every vessel arriving' here from the
Orient has brought chest loads of Jap
anese gold and in return the outward
bound liners have carried flour, lead,
niter, immense shipments of railroad
and bridge construction material and
cargo 'after cargo of rolling- stock, al].
for .the ultimate use of the Japanese
Government.
Russia's definition of what would be
considered contraband of war was suf
ficiently comprehensive ! to Include
nearly every shipment that has been
made to Japan since the beginning of
hostilities. With 1 no Russian interfer
ence this stream has flowed . without
interruption and shippers had almost
forgotten the war as a factor of pos
sible interference with the delivery of
goods ordered from Yokohama.
The marter of the Australia alleges that
â¢when Pilot Dennis took charge the engines,
by the pilot's orders, were put full- speed

Kuroki Is Moving to Attack
the Headquarters of
Kuropatkin.
Special Cable to The Call and Xcw, York Herald. Copyright/ 1904, by the
New York Herald Publishing Company.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jul^ 20.âAc
cording to the latest information re
ceived, the. battle of Motien Pass was
more serious than at first supposed, the
Russians having had at least 30.000 men
engaged. Once more victory was won
by the Japanese, owing to their far su
perior artillery, which cut the gallant
Twenty-fourth Regiment to pieces, and
in the retreat, which reached to Siako
lina, the Russian losses must have
been great. Up to themoment of send
ing you this I am still without details
as to losses, beyond the fact that they
exceeded 1000. ,
This last action has brought General
Kuroki to within twenty-two miles of
Liaoyang, which caused a nervous feel
ing to-day. The next move of the Jap
anese will be to- capture the headquar
ters of the commander-ln-chlef.
The Official Gazette announced in a
special edition* to-night two days'
fighting, yesterday and the day before,
owing to General Kuroki's advancing
in force from Matse along the Liao
yang road. â¢' This looks as though tha
fears of an attack on Liaoyang are go
ing to be shortly realized.
. Foreign critics are asking why Count
Keller was sent "to attack the enemy
without knowing Its force. The reply
Is that the Japanese line is of such ex
traordinary length that ordinary
scouting parties are helpless, and the
only means of ascertaining the num
bers of the enemy is the sending of
powerful reconnoltering forces, thereby
forcing an action.
This will explain several considerable
engagements in which the Russians,
after fighting, retired. The retreat had
been intended before the battle began.
According to Russian Tnilitarypplnion,
such retreats do not signify battles
lost, being merely part of the plan of
campaign.

port the. Russian .Government cannot

The Hamburg-American line has not
received any confirmation of the re
port, cabled to^the Daily Mail of Lon

Sambia of that line had been captured

Those few officials at the Foreign Of
fice who are in full possession of all
details of Great Britain's desire to ar
rive at an entente with Russia are in
despair. They realize that the policy
so carefully fostered by King Edward
and Foreign Minister Lansdowne will

Involve with the public the downfall of
any Ministry advocating It- Every
nerve will be strained, however, by the
Foreign Office to secure from Russia an
explanation that will pacify the ag
grieved feelings !of the British public.
However, there is expressed at the
Foreign Office and elsewhere almost
poignant regret that Russia, rightly or
wrongly, should have taken up the po
sition evidenced by the action of her
volunteer cruisers In the Red Sea.
Lord Lansdowne's policy since the
first whisper of war between Japan and
Russia reached Downing street has
been one of consistent neutrality. The
unlooked-for developments in the Dar
danelles and In the Red Sea embarrass
Lord Lansdowne " more than the cir
cumstances themselves would Indicate.
The Government, weakened by internal
dissensions, could scarcely stand for a
day against a demand for reprisals
against Russia, and this very danger
Is being fostered by leading Govern
ment newspapers.

one of the most awkward and most
serious crises it has had to face in its
checkered career.
The first of a series of four lectures
to be given under the auspices Of the
Mechanics' Institute took place last
night in the art gallery of the Mechan
ics' Pavilion. Archibald Cary Coolldge.
assistant professor of history. Harvard
University, entertained a large audience
with a complete review of the cauae3
of the present war in the Far East and
of Russia's attitude, past and present.
Professor Coolidge is one of "the leading
authorities^on Russia.
In his introductory Professor Coolidge
reviewed the beginning of the modern
era of Japan and also the slow awak
ening of the Slavic empire. In referring
to Russian diplomacy he said:
Many have referred to the alleged double*
dealing and deceit of the Russian diplomats.
England and tha United States, however, feel
perfectly able to care for themselves diplo
matically, but the Russian Uovernment Is
credited by them with more cleverness than
it credit* itself with. The extension of ItuÂ»
>i& haa caused a great deal of talk. If we
were to take from Russia to-day the territory
It has acqulrtd since 1790 there would atlll
be left a territory larger than the United
States. The advance of Russia has been like
that cf a glacUr^ â slowly but surely. ThÂ» rea
son Russia has grown so fast within the last
twenty years 13 owing to an enormous Increase
of her population, the developing of her re
sources and the building of railroads. Still
Russia, between the years of 1SOO and liMX\
has grown no more than has our own ccun
try, or than other world powers. Where Rus
sia added Siberia, wa have added the entirÂ»
West from the Mississippi to the Pacific. Rus
sia's alleged greed for land did not prevent
her from selling Alaska to us. Great Britain.
France and Germany have sdded almost twtce
as many square miles to their territory as has
Russia. Russia's greatest gain was Siberia,
but this was acquired in much tha same fash-
Ion â from nomad tribes^ â as waa our West
from the Indians. Russia had other lands,
richer and more attractive. Until lately Si
beria was the "great unknown," us"ed as the
prison of criminals, the home of adventurers
and tramps. With the building of the Trans-
Siberian railroad the life of the peasantry be
came more endurable and immigration re
ceived a forward impulse. Although the road
was built as a military maaÂ«ure. Russia was
no more prepared for the results of the last
tea years than any other nation. The Chino-
Japanese war and the Boxer war came like a
lightning flash, and hostilities in the Russo-
Japanese war began before Russia waa ready
to meet the emergencies placed upon her
main railway. Russia regarded Japan in thÂ«
Llaotung Peninsula as dangerous and *rherÂ»
each of the great powers demanded its slice
from the victorious Japanese Russia claimed
and obtained Port Arthur. Korea, whose
people have no mora liking for the Japanese
than for the Russian, was destined to become
the prey of a greater nation. And between
the choice of the two Koreans- would choose
Russian occupancy. The Russians would
merely briny their officials, a few traders and
obtain franchises, while the Japanese would
usurp the sovereignty of the kingdom and a
heavy immigration of Japanese would begin.
I am not sure that the claim of Japan
for room in which to expand is a valid claim
upon which to seize Korea. If it was brought
about that Japan could not get Korea, would
this country countenance Japan's entering
some country â Mexico, for example â upon tha
awertlon that she needed the country for her
excess population? Now, a word as to the
"open door" In the Kast. which, it la claimed.
Russia is desirous of closing! It is an open
door that opens oni way; Japan seized For

upon the policy of this Government, the Brit
ish have complained that our "open door" in

WAR SPIRIT RUNS HIGH.
British Press n-" Public Clamor for
an Accounting With Russia.
j LONDON, July 20.â The^ Associated
Press to-night interviewed many prom
inent persons connected and in close
touch with the Government relative to
the seizure of British vessels by steam
ers of the Russian volunteer fleet in
the Red Sea.
As a result of these inquiries there
is shown to be a hostile feeling against
Russia, of a strength and bitterness
almost without precedent with the war.
The most conservative, who have been
in the service of the Governnient for
many years and who openly deplored
the haste with which they thought
Great Britain had been plunged into
the Transvaal war, to-night frankly
declared for a policy of reprisal against
what is regarded as Russia's violations
of treaty and her piratical attack on
British commerce.
The warlike tone of such 'papers as
the Times, the Standard, the Morning
Post and the Daily Telegraph, which
in national crises hitherto almost in
variably have advised caution, has had
its inevitable effect. There has been
stirred up a storm of indignation
among all classes in the United King
dom, the strength of which the Gov
ernment itself can scarcely gauge.
Those who deplored the outbreak of
the war between Japan and Russia and
insisted publicly and privately that
Great Britain, crippled financially after
her South African campaign, must not
be drawn into the Far Eastern struggle,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 21, 1904.
BERLIN, July 20.â Russia has in
formed Germany, according to the Co
logne Gazette, that no report has been
received from the commander of the
Smolensk regarding the seizure on July
15 of malls on board the Prinz Hein-
The directors of the Peninsular and
Oriental Company, at a meeting this
afternoon, decided to urge strongly on
the Government the necessity for ac
tion in regard to the seizure of the Ma
lacca. The Government has been defi
nitely informed that the only explo
sives on the Malacca were stores
shipped by their Government to Hong
kong. Â¦
| It appears that the Smolensk and SL
Petersburg notonly passed through the
Dardanelles under the Russian com
mercial, flag, but that they also went
through the Suez canal under this flag
on their outward voyage.
The Malacca's passengers have been
transferred to the steamer Marmora of
the Peninsular and Oriental line.
It is said "that the Malacca has been
especially waited for by the Russians,
on secret information from Antwerp
that she was carrying ammunition and
iron work for a crane at Moji, Japan.
She was arrested during the morning
of July 13, when two and a half miles
off Great Hanish Island, near Jebel
Zukor, in spite of her captain's pro
test that the ammunition on board was
intended for the British army at Sing
apore and Hongkong. The crew .of the
Malacca was kept under strict arrest,
and when it arrived at Suez at dawn
July 19 it was not allowed to com
municate with the shore.
The Malacca arrived at Port Said
at dawn to-day and asked for 400 tons
of coal, fresh water and provisions for
Cherbourg. The case was referred to
the Egyptian Government, it being the'
first time on record that an alleged
prize had been taken through the canal
under a different flag. It happens that
that the Malacca had an abundance of
coal already and was in no great need
of' water or provisions. Therefore she
might have sailed forthwith, but she
remains here "pending instructions.
PORT SAID, July 20.â The crew and
passengers of the Peninsular and Ori
ental steamship Malacca, seized by the
Russian volunteer steamship St. Pe
tersburg in the")Red Sea, have been
landed here. The ship Is detained by the
authorities, who '.are' waiting instruc
tions before taking further action. â¢
' REPLY TO BERLIN DELAYED.
LONDON, July 20.â The opposition
leaders in the House of Commons have
allowed it to be understood that they
will be prepared to support the Gov
ernment in its representations to Rus
sia in regard to the seizure of the
steamship Malacca in the Red Sea,
PARTY LINES SET ASIDE.
The attempts to create a sensation
out of the passage of the Dardanelles
by the Russian guardship Cherno
moretz are regarded here as ridiculous.
This warship, being the regular guard
ship, has been passing in and out of
the Black Sea for twenty years.
Russia has reason to believe and con
tends that the Malacca, in addition to
British Government stores, had on
board munitions intended for Japan.
It is understood, that before sending
the cruisers the Russian authorities be
came satisfied, through an elaborate
system jof espionage, that an immense
amount of contraband was going from
England through the Red Sea to Japan,
and they decided to stop the traffic. It
is understood that if this traffic is now
diverted to the cape" route the Russian
Admiralty is prepared to send ships to
the Cape of Good Hope. If Great Brit
ain opposes the passage of the Darda
nelles by more vessels of the volunteer
fleet the ships intended for the cruising
off the cape may be sent frornvthe

Mrs. Maybrick's Imprisonment was
not terminated with the clanging of
doors at Aylesbury Prison, where she
spent more than fourteen years of her
life. It closed before the doors of the
white convent of the Sisterhood of the
Epiphany in this little town, with the
black-robed sisters softly uttering their
blessings and good wishes for her fu
ture. With tvro companions, Mrs. May
brick entered the carriage of Miss Dal
rymple, secretary of the sisterhood, and
was driven rapidly to Stausstel, a small
station fourteen miles away, where,
after exchanging gocrd-bys with her
companions, she boarded a train and
started on her journey to France. She
will not go to America until her pres
ence there is considered imperatively
necessary.
Secrecy was thrown about Mrs. May
brick's departure. Mother Superior
Julian of the convent said to a repre
sentative of the Associated Press that
under instructions she must refer all
inquiries to the Home Office. Others
at the convent were equally uncom
municative. At the railroad station or
ders were Issued forbidding the em
ployes to discuss Mrs. Maybrick.
The little town has taken deep In
terest In this international figure.
Crowds daily stood at the gate of the
grounds waiting for Mtb. Maybrick to
appear. They were rarely rewarded,
for she generally went out only when
the roadi was reported clear.
When Mrs. Maybrick first arrived
here she was kept under strict surveil
lance. Subsequently she was allowed
to walk in the quiet streets of the
town and in the country lanes.
The villagers soon got to recognize
the black-robed woman, with black
bonnet and flowing strings, and gave
her kindly greetings, which frequently
passed unnoticed. Mrs. Maybrick seek
ing so far as possible to avoid the at
tention of the curious. Her time at the
convent was taken up by sewing, reed
ing and chatting with the sisters, en
dearing herself to them by many acts
showing that even the many years of
servitude at Aylesbury Prison had been
unable to stamp out her innate kindly
disposition. â¢

them to find her not guilty In the face
of the medical evidence. The Judge
died some time later In a madhouse.
From the time of Mrs^ Maybrlck's
conviction her mother, the Barones3 de
Roques, was unremitting in her efforts
on^ behalf of the prisoner. She suc
ceeded in getting her death sentence
commuted to penal servitude for life
and finally has obtained the freedom of
her daughter, to whose release from
prison she has devoted her life. The
Baroness was aided by influential
friends on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1900, after the death of Lord Rus
sell of # KiIlowen, Chief Justice of
England, a letter which he had writ
ten to Mrs. Maybrick in 1895 was dis
covered. It showed he was convinced
that she ought never to have been con
victed and it has been generally sup
posed that all the recent American
Embassadors to the court of St. James
have done all possible to aid in Mrs.
Maybrick's pardon.
The transfer of the prisoner from a
penal prison to a quiet country homo
constituted an almost unprecedented
act on the part of the British authori
ties. It was due to the mediation of
the Duchess of Bedford, who as a
visitor to Aylesbury Prison for many
years had taken a keen personal in
terest in Mrs. Maybrick and finally
succeeded in obtaining the mitigation
of her punishment to the extent of her
being allowed to spend the last six
months of her confinement outside the
prison walls. v

LONDON, July 20.â The report of
Joseph Chamberlain's tariff commis
sion on the iron and steel trades ar
rives at the conclusion that the de
cline of the British iron and steel
Industry is due to the fact that the
manufacturers of America and Ger
many have secured control of the
home markets by means of high tariffs
and an organized system regulating
their export tra.de, that they are in a
position to damp their surplus products
on the British and other markets Ir

the British system of free Imports. The
committee expresses the opinion that
the situation can only be remedied by
a system of tariffs arranged aa fol

Harcourt was brought to Tucson by
Bartlett, who enjoyed Steinfeld's confi
dence and often borrowed money from
him, with the intention of ., defrauding
his benefactor, so it is charged in the
complaint. Barttett introduced Har
court to Steinfeld, representing that the
latter wished to purchase a half in
terest in tae gambling hall, that he had
no money with which to make the deal,
but possessed $23,000 v.orth of diamonds
and jewelry which he wished to put up
as security with Steinfeld for a loan
of 115,000. He Had pawn:: the jewelry
at Los Angeles for $6000, he said, and
it had been forwarded to hin". through
the express office to be delivered on the
payment of that amount. Steinfeld
loaned the money to Harcourt on Bart
lett's verbal guarantee that the
diamonds were worth the amount.
Bartlett explained that Harcourt had
po much valuable jewelry In his pos
session because he played the races and
invested his earnings that way to pre
vent losing all at one time. A few
nights after the loan had been made,
Harcourt lost $5000 at roulette in Bart
lett's establishment and together they
left for New York. Steinfeld soon
learned that Harcourt had no inten
tion of going into business with Bart
lett. The jewelry was packed up and
sent to a New York expert, who valued
it at $550. When Bartlett returned he
complained that he, too, had been
taken in by Harcourt, but Steinfeld
knew they had been life-long friends
and, refusing to believe Bartlett, filed
the suit for damages against him. It Is
said that Harcourt stopped at Bisbee,
while in the Territory, and sold W. H.
Brophy, president of the Bank of Bis
bee, the same kind of a gold brick,
bunkoing him out of $2000.
TUCSON, Ariz., July 20.â Albert
Steinfeld, a well-known â¢ merchant of
Arizona and a millionaire mine owner,
has been swindled out of nearly $15,000,
it is said, by Ezra Bartlett, keeper of a
gambling hall at Tucson, and J. F.
Harcourt, an alleged confederate and
New York diamond sharp. Harcourt
has flown and Steinfeld brought suit at
Tucson to-day to recover the $15,000
from Bartlett.

charge of desertion from the army.
When making the arrest the Sheriff
discovered that the young man had
been shot, and upon inquiry was in
formed that young Johnson had shot
himself in the left shoulder late the
evening before.
Johnson had been courting Miss
Winsate, a Cedar County teacher, who
resides with her parents in the neigh
borhood, until it was brought to a sud
den termination by the interference of
the young woman's father. The young
man in his desperation resolved to en
list in the army. He did so and for
about eight weeks was quartered with
his regiment at San Francisco. How
ever, he learned to his sorrow that his
love for the young woman was strong
er than his oath of allegiance as a sol
dier and he deserted his regiment and
fled to his home to renew his suit. Miss
Wingate ' refused to listen to his en
treaties, having been forbidden by her
father to have anything more to do
with him, whereupon Johnson threat
ened to shoot himself.
Johnson insisted on visiting .the
Wingate home on Monday evening and
Wingate ordered him away with a
threat that he would shoot him should
he come back. Then Johnson moved
off to an adjoining field and deliberate
ly shot himself. The prisoner 'is now
lodged in the county Jail, waiting the
orders of the United States authorities.
The doctors probed for the bullet, but
they were unable to llnd it.' Another
effort will be made with the assistance
of the X-ray, i

The convention was notably harmo

briefest held in years and it was
marked by but one enthusiastic demon
strationâthat which greeted Governor
Cummins when his name waa read in
the resolutions.
Governor Cummins made a short
speech. He declared himself in perfect
accord with the address of Congress
man Hepburn, a leading "stand pat
ter," and as he continued In this har
monious vein he was accorded cheer
upon cheer.
The resolutions adopted are brief and
they include nothing to give offense to

REDDING, July 20. â Assistant Man
ager Wisdom of the Scott & Van Ars
dale Lumber Company, which oper
ates the largest lumber plant in the
State at McCloud, Siskiyou County,
will try to resume work at the saw
mills, planing mills and box factories
to-morrow without the help of the 550
Italians who struck several days ago,
demanding that their hours be reduced
from eleven to ten a day or that their
wages be Increased from $2 to $2 25.
The manager believes that he can get
along without the Italians.
I consider American universities the best In
the world. The faculty take more Interest in
the student* than those of any other land.
The requirements are more strict than In Eng
land, Germany, France and Italy. I have
visited these countries with a view to the
future education of our Chinese youths, and
after a thorough investigation have come to
the conclusion that America Is the best land
for students from China.
The old spirit of conservatism Is being rap
idly changed to a strong sentiment of liber
ality pr.<l progress*. You see none of us wear
the old-ttmo badce of the Chinese, the queue.
It Is being discarded, even In China.
The sons of officials and wealthy men are
sent to universities to study foreign languages
and sciences.
China is making great strides toward the goal
of mrde'-n civilization and learning. 1 believe the
fact iÂ« known to few that the most powerful
viceroys In the klnsdom have petitioned the Em
l>eror for a constitutional convention and that
lt wl!l probably bÂ« called soon. It Is pro
poped to establish an upper house of parlia
ment at once.
Under the guidance of Chan Chentao
Inspector of education at Canton and
Kwangsi, fifteen sons of the highest
Chinese official class arrived here yes
terday. The boys have come to be
educated in the leading American uni
versities, in accordance with the new
policy of their Government.
They are grave, studious youths who
have already acquired all the knowledge
that their own colleges could give.
When they receive their degrees here
they will be recalled and installed in
high positions in their own country.
Mr. Chentao is himself an example of
the new movement. He graduated from
the University of California in 1902, re
ceiving the degree of M. S. His Govern
ment summoned him home and elevated
him to the position he occupies, a very
important one.
Acting on the advice of Chentao, the
Chinese Government has decided to
send the majority of Its students to
America. Chentao has investigated the
educational facilities of all nations and
has decided that those of the United
States are the most thorough. â¢
As a sign of their liberality the fif
teen seekers of Knowledge have dis
carded their queus â the ancient badge
of conservatism. As one of the boys,
Shem Tim Chingr, is the son of the
Lord Mayor of Peking this fact is sig
nificant in pointing how far the new
movement in China Is progressing. The
youths will remain in San Francisco
for two months to prepare for en
trance examinations. Columbia^ Cornell
and Yale colleges are the institutions
selected by Chentao for his charges.
Two of the boys will b.e sent to West
Point by special arrangement' to pre
pare themselves for high military posi
tions.
Mr. Chentao has the following to say
regarding the "awakening of China":

WASHINGTON. July 20.â Accord- j
ing to the statements of labor leaders
made here to-night the American Fed- i
eration of Labor is behind the strike '
of bricklayers at the arsenal and is j
bound to make a test case on the is- j
sue of non-union men being employed I
by the Government. Work on the j
War College buildings is tied up on i
account of the strike declared yester- '
day.
In the case of the Bricklayers' j
Union this particular action in de- j
daring a strike at the arsenal is the ;
result of a change in the constitution
made last winter which does away
with the old clause in which It was
stipulated that no union regulations i
would be applied to Government con- i
tracts. The constitution as it now ;
stands makes no exception for any
kind of work. ;

"While the Democratic rank and
file trembled and waited, the voice of
a quiet, reserved and able man rang
out above all the convention clamor,
drowning the roisterous hum of con
vention diplomacy. In tones of au
thority and leadership the message
went forth demanding the gold stand
ard.
"I believe no man ever did so much
for a cause and. in so many directions
in so short a time and in so compact
a form as was done by our candidate
when he sent this message to the St.
Louis convention."
"If sometimes during the last week
those most earnestly and prayerfully
solicitous for a complete restoration
of the Democratic party to health and
sanity have felt depressed by certain
convention incidents relating to the
money question, it Is certainly now
time for them and for all who love true
Democracy to calmly survey the situa
tion as it appears since the dust and
swelter of the convention controversy
have passed away.
"No action of the Democracy's rep
resentatives assembled in the late con
vention can be construed in any other
way than as an acknowledgment of
the establishment of a gold standard
and a willing pledge to its mainte
nance.
NEW YORK, â¢ July 20. â "Steady,

FALL RIVER, Mass., July 20.âUn
less the cotton mill owners of this city
who operate what are known as union I
plants abandon their announced inten- j
tlon of inaugurating on Monday next j
a new scale of wages which would re- j
duce the earnings of their employes
12% per cent 31.000 operatives will
stop work following the strike vote
cast to-night by the Textile Workers' j
Unfon.
By a vote of 1510 to 396 the union
men decided to strike Monday, disre- j
garding the suggestion of the Textile I
Council that a strike was inadvisable
at this time. ' It is the general belief
in this city that the mill owners will
reconsider their decision "to reduce
wages and so avoid a strike. This be
lief is based on the argument of the
union 'leaders that the cotton and I
cloth markets are in such condition |
that a shut down at this time would (
be ruinous to the. manufacturers. j
A meeting of Thirtieth Assembly
District voters was held last evening
at 'Butchers' Hall, corner of Folsorn

Thirtieth District.
"The commercial bodies of Los An
geles," said Flint, "are active and ear
nest in the support of my candidacy.
They hold that Senator Bard's views
against the admission of New Mexico
and Arizona to statehood are contrary
to the commercial sentiments of the
south and there Is a general .feeling in
favor of the election of a young and
active man to represent California in
the United States Senate. There ia
nothing in the story that Judge Me-
Kinley will be brought out as a candi
date. I knew that he had determined
to keep out of the contest as an as
pirant for the place when I announced
my candidacy."
Referring to the proposed caucus to
determine the question of strength in
the south, Flint was asked to name the
counties that should be consulted and
he named Santa Barbara, Ventura, San
Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, Los
Angeles and San Diego, but did not
include Kern and San Luis Obispo.
The most cordial greeting to Flint
in San Francisco was extended yester
day at the office of the senior United
States Senator, George C. Perkins. The
hand of the Senator was freely and
gladly given. .Topics, personal and po
litical, were discussed at length, but
no definite conclusions were reached.
At the Union League Club dedication
in Los Angeles Senator Bard, Henry
T. Oxnard and Frank P. Flint will
meet on neutral ground to promote
Republican success in the campaign.
Ex-State Senator E. C. Voorheis of
Amador and ex-Congressman James A.
Louttit of San Joaquin are in the city.
Frank P. Flint of Los Angeles, one of
the well-known candidates from the
south for the office of United States
Senator, arrived in San Francisco yes
terday and was greeted by many
friends. He will remain^here a day or
two and exchange views with lead
ing Republicans. The intelligence comes
from Pasadena that B. W. Hahn, one
of the hold-over ' State Senators, has
pitched his tent In the Flint camp. C.
W. Pendleton and William H. Savage,
who are "hold-overs," have not openly
declared their preferences. At' the pri
mary election on August 9 the Los An
geles Republicans will elect delegates
to nominate eight Assemblymen and
one State Senator. Flint expects to win
the Los Angeles delegation.
â¢ "It is the Judgment of our people,"
said Flint in an interview last night,
"that the Senatorship belongs to the
south and that the Republican aspirant
receiving the indorsement of the ma
jority of the Republican members of
the Legislature from Southern Califor
nia should be chosen United States
Senator. For one, I am willing to go
into caucus on the agreement that the
candidate developing the greatest
strength shall be accepted as the choice
of the southern delegations. My per
sonal relations with Senator Bard and
Mr. Oxnard are friendly. I entertain
the highest respect for both. There is
no truth whatever in the story of bit
terness between myself and Senator
Bard growing out of the appointment
of L. H.* Valentine as my successor in
the office of United States Attorney for
the southern district. I had served
more than four years when my suc
cessor was named. Senator Bard states
the position correctly when he speaks
of the cordial relations existing be
tween us. A friendly personal feeling
exists between Mr. Oxnard and my
self.

Contest Is Discredited
NEW YORK. July 20.â There was a
scattering to-day of the Democratic
leaders who for the last three days
hare been discussing campaign plans
In this city. Nearly all of them will
return for the meeting of the Demo
cratic National Committee next Tues
day, but all who took part In yester
day's conference agreed that much
progress had been made.
Probably the most Important feature
of the gathering was the discussion of
methods for raising money to meet the
expenses of the campaign. The par
ticipation of August Belmont. Daniel
S. Lamont and Thomas F. Ryan In the
discussion is significant In this connec-
tian. Many other men who are well
known In finance were consulted in
dividually by men who attended the
conference and the result, it was said,
was all that could have been desired.
It has heen decided to leave the ques
tion of choosing the chairman of the
Democratic National Committee to this
committee itself. The announcement
was made to-night that no attempt to
forestall the action of the committee
would be permitted. Thomas Taggart
of Indiana, whose failure to reach this
city in time for the conference caused
surprise, arrived at the Hoffman House
to-night and slipped away to the home

It may be said with certainty that
there will be no opposition to the elec
tion of Senator German to the chair
manship if he can accept and that he
will have the assistance of a strong
committee to relieve him of a portion
of his burdens of office. Senator Gor
man left for Atlantic City to-day, still
strongly opposed to taking the place,
but the leaders have not given up all
hope of persuading him. In case he
insists in refusing to serve, Taggart

WHAT OASVSE OF A LETTER.
My Dear Aunt Kate : '
I must tell you the good news. Right
after receiving your letter, the day before
New Year's I started in with new resolu-
tions on the first of the year. I wrote to
Dr. R. V. Pierce, at Buffalo, N. Y., as you
requested me to do. I pave him all my
symptoms, which were that I was tiredâ
so tiredâ all the time and did not care to
go anywhere, depressed and aad, and all
ambition gone, backache and a dragged-out
feeling, could not sleep, limbs feelinjr Â«ore
and aching. I followed the doctor's advice,
which he went to considerable pains to
make plain to me â to rest every day â a nap
after lunchâ complete relaxationâ cultivate
repose of mind, try not to worry, get as
rauch outdoor air as possible, and prac-
tice long, deep breathing, expanding the
lungs. Then for a uterine tonic. Dr. Pierce's
Favorite Prescription, coupled with a wash
he told me of. I must say that after follow-
ing his advice for four months I feel per-
fectly cured and like a new woman.
Yours affectionally, Jewel.

SAN DIEGO. July 20.â The Chief of

Campo, on the edge of the desert, say
ing the man supposed to be Padillo,
alias Aguila, the alleged murderer of
Pedro Chavez at Colton Sunday even

asking that a definite description be
sent. Later a message was received
saying the man did not fit the descrip
tion and he was released.
We deem It neoessary to call your attention
to the fact that the second-hand dealers In
boilers in this city are buyinc old boilers from
all over the State and overhauling and repair-
Ing them slijrhtly and thÂ«n selling them to
small manufacturers and others, whereby the
lives and property of our citizens I are . en
dangered. These boilers have been condemned
and with minor repairs and a. little paint are
made to look safe and durable. They are in
stalled In larse restaurants and other build
ings, thus forming a veritable fire trap . for
the -community at large. With a boiler in

such as Internal cracks, blisters, pitting and

As the Supervisors made no appro
priation for salaries of District Health
Officers Adler. Tillman and Dillon the
positions were abolished. Adler and
Tillman were reappointed as laboratory
medical asistants under the charter
provision which exempts the appoint
ment of physicians from civil service.
As to the retention of Prs. Walsh
and Hannah as Inspecting physicians,
the Health Board claims this was done
in order not to prejudice the case now
before Judge Sloss affecting the restora
tion of former Sanitary. Inspectors
Hartley and Green, who were displaced
Regarding the Increases in the sala
ries of Bacteriologist Canney, Chemist
Bothe and Assistant Chemist Costa, to
which the Finance Committee objects,
the Health Board replies that the Su
pervisors refused to provide sufficient
funds for the food inspection depart
ment, which was abolished on that ac
count. The added duties in the bacte
riological tests of milk resulted in the
raising of Canney's salary Bothe was
retained as head of the laboratory de
partment, into which the food depart
ment, together with its fund, was
merged, which the Health Board claims
it had a perfect right to do.
The provision also requires that all
appointments in the Health Depart
ment shall be made according to arti
cle 13 of the charter and civil service.
The Health Board's reply denies the
right of the Supervisors to fix the sala
ries of its employes in the face of the
specific charter provision quoted- The
board also denies that It Is exceeding
its budget allowance in the payment of
salaries.
In Its reply, which will be filed to
day with the Board of Supervisors, the
Health Board will stand on the charter
provision that it has sole power to des
ignate the number of its employes and
to fix their salaries. The board is
backed up by an opinion from the City
Attorney and by several court decisions
based on the charter provision on the
subject, which follows:
"The Health Board may appoint such
officers, agents and employes as may be
necessary for the proper and efficient
carrying out and enforcement of the
duties and purposes of the board, and
may fix their salaries and prescribe
their duties."
The Board of Health held a confer
ence last night and completed the prep
aration of Its reply to the allegations
contained in the report of the Super
visors' Finance Committee that the
budget allowances for salaries in the
central health office were being exceed
ed by the sum of $7320 and that the
civil service restrictions in the appoint
ment of subordinates were being vio
lated.
With this knowledge in view the
heirs are not resting In anticipation
but are preparing to file formal pro
test to the will when the petition for Its
admission to probate is called for hear
ing. In the offices of Hiram W. John
son, who represents Henry Schander
of Sacramento, an uncle of the de
ceased, the work of preparing the con
test Is proceeding. Albert M. Johnson,
who is associated with his brother,
Hiram W. Johnson, said last evening
that the contest would be based upon
but one ground â unsoundness of mind.
The filing of this contest will be the
signal for the opening of negotiations
for a compromise. Then the claims of
the various heirs will be taken up, one
at a time, and disposed of as condi
tions demand.
Those heirs that would enjoy the
fruits of the compromise which it is
said the devisees of the bulk of the es
tate of the late Bertha M. Dolbeer are
willing, to enter into must write their
names and claims on the records of
the court. Though there Is no question
that these principal deviseesâ Miss Etta
M. Warren and her mother, Mrs. Mar
garet H. Warren â are willing to pla
cate the disgruntled heirs of the sui
cide with a portion of her gold, they
do not intend to enrich those that have
no right to be enriched, nor to give
more than is necessary to those whose
relationship to the dead gives them at
least a moral right to share in her es
tate.

RENO. Nev., July 20. â The direct
charge is made by the people of White
Pine County that Sheriff Newman is
responsible for the escape of the two
desperate horse thieves, Armstrong
and Thomas, who cut their way out of
the jail at Ely last week. The citi
zens in a signed statement yesterday
asked the Grand Jury of White Pine
County to investigate the case and
place the blame where it belongs.
They further allege that not only did
the Sheriff allow the prisoners to es
cape, but when the time came to take
up the chase the Sheriff and his dep
uties only made a pretense at follow
ing the trail of the fleeing men. The
accusation has caused widespread in
terest throughout the State and will
undoubtedly result in the matter be
ing thoroughly investigated.

tend its road to meet the Senator
Clark line and secure a direct route to

BAKERSFIELD. July 20.â The in
dependent producers at Kern River are
ready to form an association for the
purpose of securing better prices for
their oil. Nearly all of the companies
outside of the Associated have been and
are disposing of their product to one
or the other of the big purchasers, the
Standard and the Associated. The
Standard Is Btoring millions of barrels
and the Associated is a heavy buyer,
for the reason that it has- contracts
calling for an amount of oil far in ex
cess of Its production.- The Standard
Is paying but 15 cents and the Asso
ciated, when necessity compels it, pays
as high as 17% cents.
The Independent producers have been
compelled to accept the low figures
named, but if the plans which are now
being formed are carried out, the en
tire product will be pooled and the
Standard and the Associated will find
it impossible to purchase oil either for
storage or for the market at any such
prices as they have been paying in the
past. Some of the heaviest indepen
dent producers in the field are back of
the pooling project and a meeting will
shortly be held at whicn a permanent
organization will be perfected. It is
expected that the combine will later be
extended to include producers In West
Side fields.

Hawkins, the fourteen-year-crtd boy
who was arrested on suspicion of hav- ,
ing murdered and robbed George Morse
on a fruit ranch five miles east of this |
city, Tuesday night, broke down in '
Jail this evening and confessed his i
rullt. He said that Morse had fre
quently abused him while they were
Â¦working- together on the ranch and that j
being homesick and without money he j
determined several days ago to kill i
Morse, possess himself of his victim's j
funds and go to his sister's home in j
Aiameda County.
According to the story told by Han
kJns he followed Morse to where he
Â¦was milking a cc-w Tuesday evening
and. approaching him without exciting
suspicion, fired the fatal shot, robbed
him of his purse and then departed.
Hankins hardly seems to realize the
Beriousness of his crime. The officers
have notified his relatives in Aiameda
of his arrest.
Mrs. Ella S. Weirs of Xewton and
Hanover avenues, Peralta Heights,

It developed during the examination
of Hankir.s that his father had been
killed two years ago while committing
a burglary in a small town in the East.
His mother had previously secured a
divorce from him and came to Califor
nia with the boy. She died in Aiameda
last March.
After the murder Hankins came to
this city and put up at a hotel, where
he was found at an early hour this
morning by the officers. When arrest
ed he denied his fruilt and toid his cap
tors a story of having witnessed the
murder of Morse by an unknown man.
He said that he had given chase to
the murderer and had fired several
shots at him, but was unable to effect
his capture. He was unable to explain,
however, why he had failed to report
the crime to the authorities if his story
\\ as true. After thinking over the mat
tor he decided to tell the true story of
the crime.
Hankins has proved troublesome to
his sister, with whom he has been liv
ing in Aiameda, after the death of his
mother ar.d she sent him here in the
hope of reforming him. He had been
keeping company with vicious lads of
his own age and his sister thought that
a change of ncene and a home with

his ways.

GREAT PARADE
HELD BY ELKS
Walker was a member of the Knights

lodge at Truckee have taken charge
of the body, which will be shipped to
this city for burial. No arrangements
have yet been made for the funeral,
but it will probably be held from the
family residence at 991 Willow street,

Walker has been for twenty-five
years in the employ of the Southern
Pacific Company, and for several years
was one of the company's traveling

60 years old and leaves a wife, Mrs.
Kate B. Walker, and eight* children.
The latter are: Robert S. Walker,
William G. Walker,,Otto Walker, Mrs.
J. L. Day, Mrs. George Morrow, Mrs.

Walker left the camp at Mystic last
Saturday to go on a fishing trip down
the river in company with his 15-year
old son Otto. When near Lynham the
father and son separated in order to
fish both sides of the river. This was
about 4 o'clock. Shortly after 5 o'clock
a rancher passing along the road near
the river paw a man answering the
description of Walker fishing from a
high point of rocks near the marble
quarry.
It is thought that the unfortunate
man lost his footing -vhlle climbing
over the rocks and fell into the water,
which is very deep at this point, and
being unable to swim was drowned.
The body was found floating in a
pool below the old marble quarry near
Lynham by a man named Yates, a
member of the Truckee .River Country
Club. After making sure that the body
was that of Walker the finder at once
telephoned to the wife of the dead
man, who resides at 991 Willow street

offered a reward for the recovery of
the remains, and at the time of the

PREACHED UNLAWFULLY
In the beginning of his lecture Dr.
Loeb discussed the results of experi
ments in which unfertilized eggs were
caused to develop without sperm and
by means of physical-chemical or pure
ly chemical agencies. He showed that
by the mere extraction of water from
the eggs of sea urchins cortatn worms
and mollusks could be caused to de
velop into swimming larvae. In some
of the forms experimented upon the vi
tality of the larvae which are thus
produced seems to be almost as great
as in the larvae produced by fertiliza
tion. Dr. Loeb continued:
Various solutions are used to fertilise, the
eggs used In theÂ«e experiments. Their natural
element of sea water Is always used. thÂ« con
crtstratJon of which U raised to about 30 pe r
cent by sugar or salt. The best results have
been obtained with potassium chloride. When
the concentration of the water is raised :so
per cent and the temperature from 15 to *Â»0
degrees the eggs are left for two hours In
the solution and stages of natural development
noted.
The experiments Â«bow conclusively that the
eggs can be fertilised without the aid of
spermatozoon. At least snch results have been
obtained with the eggs ot the sea urchin,
the analids and In some of the mollusks
The experiments of a FYench author.* De
TVÂ« have found that there is a distinct dif
ference between the mature and Immature
Â«-FTÂ» of the starfish. In the Immature eggs
there U no nuckus. such a* may be clearly
f-en in the -mature egg. In case these eggs
are not fertilized within three or four hours
after birth they turn black and become a
Â»>re> to bacteria in the water. The mature
Â«*ggÂ» live, we have found, for seven days, and
they can be developed very rapidly If the
*aier is supplied with a email amount of
alkali or oxygen.
It mieht be argued that the death of the
â¢ KÂ»Â» wa* caukÂ«-d by bacteria, but aÂ» I said
before this is not no. This is clearly shown
to an exrx-riment that has. been made with
egK* in three flasks containing three different
i-i>iut!ons. In the first was put perfectly stori!*
vÂ»ter. in tin- Â«=e/-ond comtaon sea water and In
toe third wa water infected by the putrid

jjernd the water shoned â¢ large per cent
of Hack egc? i n ,^ cn naFk> Bhowlnr th&t
d-ath was caused, not by external but by in
ternel conditions nnly. it would 'be interest
ing to find the cause of the disintegration of
the eggs and whether it may be avoided.
NEED FERTI LIZATIOX.
The Â«Â£gs of the animal live when they are
fertilized under certain conditions. Tfce eggs
are developed by these processes. f>otne form*
more rapidly thaa others. The tfeatoent
brings about a change in the *>cÂ»r. which is
equivalent to saving it* life. This fact, 1
wish to say, hat an important bearing on the
rreblern of natural death. We really have
r Â¦> r-icJ-.t to epe&k of such a thlrs ae natural
death. VTe urually speak of death an the
disablement of some orgnn of the body, which
come* in the order of nature.
And In this connection the question arises
whether It is poseitle to prolong life. Ex
j*rtment shows that there is a period in the
life of aa egg when it is In a critical state
end likely to die unless it is treated. For
instance, the ejrgs of the etarfl>h when taken
from the ovary are ae a rule not all mature.
E<Tne of these immature eg*r* maturate In the
*tter. but others do not. Xow we find thst
thÂ« eggs that are mature die if enough oxygen
is present in a comparatively short time, a
few hours. Â«*.y. while the immature eggs may
live for fiiys and the eggs that are fertilized
may li\ - e for weeks, month? and yeaiy. It
rsii be shown conclusively that thÂ» death of
tfie mature egc* is due to internal processes
and not due to bacteria. These processes that
lea<j to the death of the mature egg are pre
vented by the entrance of the spermatozoon
or by the matrcent of the egg with carbon
dioxide.
DEVELOPMENT OF EGGS.
Dr. Loeb gave a hint of interest to
the medical world touching the possible
results of his biological experiments as
relating to the formation of tumors on
human beings. On this topic he dwelt
briefly, asserting that it might be
shown ttfat the growth could be con
quered. Professor Loeb suggested
there might be an analogy between the
embryo sea life which he is investigat
ing and the embryo of the tumor.
It was in the course of a lecture on
artificial parthenogenesis this evening
in the students' observatory at the
t'niversity of California that Dr. Loeb
g-ave out the suggestion that the day
might come when death will not be the
end-all of human existence. The scien
tist takes this advanced ground because
his experiments have developed that in
the eggs of some animal?, at least,
there is artificial state in which they
die, in -*hich death is not caused by
external causes, but by internal causes,
and this is bound to be true when the
fertilization of the eggs by sperm or by
artificial means saves the life of the
egg. Said Dr. Loeb:
BERKELEY. July 20.â Professor
Jacques Loeb's experiments with artl
f.cial parthenogenesis, which meant
the fertilization of the eggs of animalp
vtth chemical preparations, have con
vinced him that death is not altogether
the one thing that man has all these
aeeÂ» looked upon as Inevitable. In
fact, he thinks It quite possible that in
the cane of some animals, at least, life
may be prolonged indefinitely by the
treatment of th* disabled organs of
the body. This applies to the egg of
the starfish, which the scientist says
responds to treatment at certain crit
ical traces in its life.
Dr. Loeb Fays that man has not even
a right to speak of "natural death."
"It Is by no means certain that death,
f ven in old age, can be called 'natural
cÂ«"ath.' We know that as a rule death
is caused by the fact that some im
rortant organ is disabled, but we are
i.Â«= far from certain that such disability
5s= absolutely unavoidable," declares the
learned biologist.

Harry Tracy, a teamster, missed
death by a few Inches this morning in
West Berkeley. "While attempting to
cross the tracks at Third and Camelia
streets his team was struck, by the
Southern Pacific overland "Cannon-
Ball" and hurled twenty feet in the air.
In descending Tracy fell against ' a
freight car standing near by and spec
tators thought he had been killed. The
man revived in a few minutes. The
horses were killed outright and the wa
gon was demolished.
Tracy's view of the tracks was ob
structed bj' two long rows of freight
cars that stood at the point where he
sought to pass, which explains the
cause of the accident.

The aasesument on the Contra Coata Water
Company's plant haÂ« been largely decreased.
In addition to the statement which 1 have
already given cut on thi9 subject I will say
that I have the matter in the courts, where
I can make a test <*aee of it. Until this is
decided I have taken off the a^essment on
the franchises and the water In the reservoirs
of the company. The value of these are
largely problematical. Mayor Olney has said
the franchises are not worth anything because
they are not exclusive. The insue however,
ha* been raided and we will get a decis'en on
it one of these days and find out what is
prcper.
The property of the Oakland Gas. Light and
Heat Company is about the -amp as last year.
1 have put the assessment of the franchises
cf the Strtjthern Pacific for running ferry-boats
Across the bay back on the rolls again this
yÂ«-ar. Laet year each 6f these franchises were
rf-duefd by the Board of Equalization to $5.
I want to have this matter terted in the courts
and shall continue to aFsean them until I
get a board which will leave them on and
make the .company get a decision on the
matter, s
The apse^ment en the property of the
Spring Yailey Water Company has been In
creased about $1,000,000. The greater amount
of thin increase Is on the riparian risrhtu of
the company on Alameda. San Antonio and
ot-er creeks.
There will he an Inercaso on the property
of the Realty Syndicate, but I cannot nay
what this will aggregate. It has property all
over the city and this has been valued along
with property In the vicinity. What this
will all total I cannot tell.
County Assessor Henry P. Dalton ar
rived here to-dav from the wilds of
Siskiyou, where he had been for sever
al days, and gave further facts in re
gard to the assessment of the county,
but states that it will be to-morrow
noon before any definite figures will be
ready for publication. There has been
a general increase in the assessment of
the .county that witt- probably reach
54,000,000. Besides this some of the big
corporations have had the value of
their holdings considerably increased
on the books. The increase on the
Spring Valley aggregates $1,000,000. In
speaking of what had been done in this
regard Dalton saiQ:
While the assessment rolls are complete the
work of totaling up the footings- has not been
finished find 1 cannot give out what the-ag
g egate r asÂ»epfted valuation of the property In
the county in. With the blK corporation* 1
can say In a general way that the Increase en

CONSOLIDATION PROJECTED. â Oakland.
July 20.â Consolidation of Plymouth Congrega
tional Church with Oak Congregational Chapel
has been advanced to take the place of the
abandoned Idea of the union of Plymouth and
the Fourth Congregational Church. The new
project will be â¢ given consideration by the
members of the Interested churches. Plymouth
Church has made no move toward getting a
pastor to succeed Rev. Charles W. Hoag.' whose
name wa* linked with that of Mrs. W. W.
Benedict, a member of the church choir.
There resides at Folkestone a man
named George Keel, who in December
next will reach the age of 104 years.
He was born at Manton, a village near
Marlborough, in Wiltshire, and up to
a few years ago followed the calling of
a shepherd. He still earns a trifle by
tending gardens in Folkestone. Mr.
Keel is a good walker. He reads with
out glasses, but is very deaf. As a
non-smoker.. he declares that those who
use tobacco are not meant for the
kingdom of heaven. He uses alcoholic
stimulants very sparingly. He Is a
favorite with the clergy of St. Savior's
Church, where v e is a regular wor
shiper. His wife died when rhe was
nearly ninety. The centenarian has
lived under five sovereigns and well re

A marked difference between the two
is the^close touch with life which the
American college girl has and . the
English girl of the same class has not.
The latter gives herself to the studies
of the curriculum alone and waits for
social and practical life until the col
lege course is completed. The advant
age is with the American girl; who is
not thrust into a wholly new sphere on
leaving the university and does not
find herself at sea as to social forms
and conventionalities. The French
girl, as well as the English, is looking
with no little envy on the American
girl. Evidence of this is seen in the
popularity of a play by Paul Hyacinthe
Loyson, son of the once famous Pere
Hyacinthe, and his American wife.
The name of the' play is "The Maiden's
Right." Contrary to alL French tra
ditions, it claims for the French maiden
tKe right to the American girl
and make close acquaintance with her
future husband before marriage, in
stead of being handed over to him as If
It were a matter of no importance to
her. \
These compliments from across the
water should jnake the American girl
mindful of the reputation she is gain
ing abroad and lead her to â¢ be careful
to live up to It. If she can have free
dom and be obedient to the laws which
govern freedom and if/ she can main
tain self-reliance without excess of self
assertion she may well be the envy of
her kindred beyond the Atlantic, other
wise she will merit only their contempt.
It is not the American heiress alone
who is appreciated on the other side
of the Atlantic. The American college
girl is looked upon with surprise and
admiration. Her freedom, coupled with
self-restraint, her ability to take her
affairs into her own hands and man
age them to advantage, her poise in
the presence of men students and her
readiness to cope with them in the
higher and more abstruse branches. are
becoming the envy of English college
girls. >

"There is many a pitfall for the com
plexion in the fashionable brown,"
says a Chicago artist "As a rule, it
intensifies the color of the eyes to
match them or wear a deeper shaJe
of the same color. Especially Is this
true of blue, but in brown it does not
always have a happy effect. Fot in
stance, the brown eyes that are ac
companied by hair that is two or three
shades darker, or almost black, are not
improved by any of the fashion: ":Ie
reddish or golden browns.
"Instead, these shades clash with a
tinge of purple that is always lurking
around the eyes and hair in this com
bination and the result Is a spotted
effect. The only brown possible to this
complexion is a dark seal that renders
it opaque. . The woman with hair of a
little brighter shade, however, has usu
ally a tinge of red in her cheeks, which
is brought out by a brown of a wirm
reddish shade.
"The Titian haired woman with eyes
n shade or two darker may also wear
the shades that match either eyes or
hair, because her color scheme is pure.
Even an occasional freckle on her face
shows that the pigment is all upon the
same order."â Chicago Tribune.

The following story comes from Rus
sia, where, of course, yellow Journal
ism is unknown. It is, moreover, print
ed In the - Novoe Vreraya, which is
as conservative a sheet as one would
want to read,. It concerns a girl of 12,
named Llsuba, living in Vladlcaucasus,
who Is said to possess radio-active
qualities. She has been trying to earn
her living as a servant, but has been
dismissed from every- situation she se
cured on account of this unhappy en
dowment. Every object she approaches
Is set in motion. Plates on a dresser
rattle, linen hung out to dry falls on
the ground, bottles rise from the table
and are upset. The general condition
of the girl is normal; she is quite
healthy, free from any nervous trouble,
and disposed to regard her magnetic
powers as a . huge Joke. Her parents,
however, are in despair about her, "as
most of their neighbors declare that
Lisuba is possessed by evil spirits. The
local doctors have studied her case
without being able to solve the enigma,
so the unfortunate child will shortly
be sent to St. Petersburg, to be dealt
with by specialists. The account given
in the Novoe Vremya reads .like a
page of Hans Andersen: but the truth
of the details is vouched for by its ac
credited correspondent at Vladicauca

To this en* a resolution has been pre

to place the matter of the additional

ties and asks that the new Secretary
of the Department of Labpr and Com
merce use. his Influence in securing' the
appointment of th"e necessary carriers.
Acting ilium the suggestion of J. F.

upon the officials of the Southern Pa
cific Company and urge that the com
pany run an all-night ferry service be

Charles "Wiggins, 13 years old, resid
ing on Homestead avenue. Upper
Frultvale, is the hero of a kidnaping
expedition, according to his exciting
narrative of adventure, related to-day
to' the police.
Charles avers that he was captured
last night on Twenty-third avenue by
two men who carried him off In a cart
to the Contra Costa foothills, at the
head of the avenue. There, under pen-,
alty of death, his abductors kept the
boy all night. At dawn this morning
young Wiggins escaped, so he explain
ed, and made his way home, footsore,
weary and hungry.
As soon as Charles had completed his
tale, his parents, who had been much
alarmed over his absence, communicat
ed with the police.
The boy left home yesterday morn
ing to visit with friends named John
son, residing at 1173 East Sixteenth
street. He left there at 4" o'clock yes
terday afternoon. Master Wiggins ac
counts for his failure to arrive home
with the story of the mysterious men.
The police say they take the story
for what it is worth, but they do not
put any value on it.

On February 11. 1902, Knop's brother,
Elfert, also a bachelor, died in this city,
leaving an estate worth $87,500. After
the payment of bequests ranging from
$2500 to $10,000 to the same German
heirs, the residue, amounting to $61,526,
went to Henry, who was the adminis
trator of the estate. A half-Interest in
a grocery and saloon business at the
corner of Broadway and Montgomery
street was among the property.
Knop disposes of his fortune as fol
lows: To his brother Herman, at Alf
stedt, amt Bremervorde, Hanover Ger
many, $50,000; to his brother Johann K.,
at the same place, $30,000; to the heirs
of his deceased sister, Geshe Junge, her
son Heinrich $5000 and the children of
her deceased daughter, Margretha, $5000.
All the residue goes to the brother Her
man. The estate consists chiefly of
cash and bonds.
In going through Knop's effects 6.
will dated April 2, 1902, was found, and
it was turned over to the law firm of
Lloyd & Wood. The attorneys filed the
document, together with the petition of
L. G. Murphy and John "W. Van Ber
gen for letters of administration. They
were named in the will as executors
without bonds.
Over In Germany the two brothers
and other relatives of Henry Knop.
who was found dead in his room in the
Commercial Hotel last Tuesday, will
be enriched by probably $250,000, the
estimated value of the estate.

died and had no relatives in this coun
try. It was supposed that he had left
no will and was without heirs, and
upon this supposition Public Adminis
trator W. J. Hynes on Tuesday secured
special letters of administration . upon
the estate.

TO WHOM IT MAT CONCERN: A year and
three months ago I waa attacked with that
terrible disease, locomotor atazta. Power to |
balance, stand, or even sit down, entirely lost,
rwo best doctors of San Francisco and Hot
sprlnss. Ark., failed to help me. My stom-
ach, bowels and kidneys failed to work. I had
catarrh of stomach, head and bladder as a re-
Â»uit of the disease; these troubles becam*
chronic. At times my heart would beat like a
arum, my eyes grew weak, my memory bad,
"^nerves wrecked. Threo months ago I went
to Tuscan Springs. What happened since was
a piessant surprise to me. Drank the waters,
took the bathsâ after three weeks' treatment
Jtornaeh. bowels, bladder and kidneys in per-
fect condition, eyealgbt perfect, nervousness
rone, memory good. After three months' treat-
ment, walked without a cane, with eyes closed
ana up an( i down steep bills: am cured of thla
aread disease, now walk with slight limp.
Have run stores In seventeen towns of the
state of California; am well known In down-
ow , n dlstrl cts of San Francisco: inquiry there
will prove truth of my helpless condition three
months ago. Further information, address

The zone of the world's interest in the far Eastern
war has been transferred from the scene of battle in
Manchuria to the Dardanelles and the. Black Sea, where
is stored the gunpowder of probable danger to the pow
ers of Europe. Statesmen and not soldiers must now
occupy the stage and the world will watch with eager
ness to see if the climax of their activities be a farce or
a tragedy in the story of the world's great affairs.

RUSSIAN ROYALTY.
THE scandalous conduct of the Russian Grand
Duke Boris, cousin of the Czar, while at the front
with the army of Kuropatkin is a picture of the
royal demoralization that besets a dynasty which holds
its place by keeping the masses in ignorance and super
stition and by cruelty to all who are informed enough to
desire liberty and the enjoyment of human rights. When
Boris was in this country he showed himself a thorough
paced, ingrained blackguard of the lowest type. His
conduct on the steamer at sea was such that he ought to
have been treed up and catted. In Chicago and the East
during his visit he was received into society with a view
of entertaining him as if he were, a civilized- gentleman.
He abused the courtesies in every case and showed less
sensibility and appreciation than we are accustomed to
see in our red Indian chiefs, like Red Cloud and Spotted
Tail.
Now, while the soldiers of his country are dying by
thousands in a war provoked by the ambitions of his
family, he paints Manchuria red with his debaucheries
and brutality. . No wonder the Russian soldiers have so
Grozi'iug Basket IVillcnv.
The culture and manufacture of
basket willow have not attained in the
United States the degree of perfection
and profit that mark the industry in
Europe. This is for several reasons,
the most Important being the relative
compensation of labor and the fail
ure of the American grower to adopt
the most improved methods. The
growing, harvesting, care and manu
facture of willow require manual la
bor wholly unassisted by machinery.
The cheap labor of Europe has grown
willow and woven -it into baskets at
a profit impossible with us and our
better paid labor. American Ingenuity
has still further complicated the Is
sue by producing a cheap split wood
basket to take the place of the more
expensive and durable willow. Thus
tn industry of good possibilities Is lan
guishing.
The bureau of forestry has taken
up the matter and given It careful
study. Its expert has thoroughly in
vestigated the methods of culture and
manufacture both In this country and
in England. Germany and Holland. In
addition the bureau has established
a willow plantation on the depart
ment's experimental grounds near
Alpha and Omega of Chicago.
Charles J. Aabel, an engineer, living
at 53 North State street, is the first
citizen of Chicago, in the sense that -his
name heads the long list of names in
the directory for 1904. A man of the
same name stood at the head last year.
The last name of the 657,000 contained
in the directory Is Joseph Zywa, 4842
South Elizabeth street. Last year one
of his countrymen, John Zyzna,
brought up the rear of the constantly
Increasing procession of citizens who
owe allegiance to Chicago. As has been
observed by the directory publishers
for years, the Johnsons are very much
In evidence. They crowd more pages of
names than anybody else, and the
Smiths come in a close second. The Ol

Certain persons, interested in the well-being and
prosperity of saloons, have asked the Supervisors to
make the lunch counter one of those prohibited things
which must pass into the limbo of discarded vices that
no law-abiding saloonist may indulge under severe pen
alty of the law. Let us wish the request success on its
devious progress into the statute- books. As a law it will
work wonders of improvement to the digestive apparatus
of many of our worthy citizens.
Nor wasted breath in boasting; when
work there was to do
They held their peace In patience, the
only peace they knew.
But peace is hard to conquer, and harder
still to hold
When treasure-laden galleons make
skulking pirates bold.
Alone the fathers voyaged; alone they
held their way;
But half a world In convoy looks up to
us to-fcay.
To guard them with our bulwarks when
rovers swarm in force;
To guide them to the haven by freedom's
chart and course;
To share our lot as brothers, till all the
world shall know
From sea to sea one peopleâ one flag
from snow to snow.
â James Jeffrey Roche in Collier**,
In stress of tide or tempest, or In the
deadly grip
Of broadside scraping broadside, they
sailed and fought the ship;
When seas were black before then and
skies above were black,
Xo hand refused its duty, no eye looked
longing back.
Now honor to the fathers who sailed the
ship of state.
The mighty who were humble, the simple
who were great!
They fired no noisy salvos, no gaudy
banners flew.
But silent, sober, solemn, they turned
them to the blue.

General "Joe" "Wheeler relates the
following amusing incident that took
place during the night of the El Caney
affair:
"General Lawton's division was
marching back to El Paso, there to
take up a new position In the morn-
Ing. The general, in company with
Major Creighton Webb, inspector gen
eral of his staff, was standing at the
edge of the road, watching his troops
tile past. Just an dawn was breaking
the colored troops came in sight. They
gave evidence of being dead tired, but
were nevertheless full of 'ginger.'
"General Lawton's attention was at
tracted to a certain corporal of the
Twenty-fifth Infantry, a great six-foot
r.csrro, who in addition to a couple of
puns and two cartridge belts loaded
fall, was carrying a dog. The soldier
to whom the other gun belonged was
limping alongside his comrade.
"The general halted the men. 'Here,
corporal,' said he to the six-foot man,
"didn't you mareh all last night?'
" 'Yes, dr.' responded the negro, sa
luting.
" 'And fought all day?*
" 'Yes. elr.'
** 'You have, besides been marching
since ten o'clock last night?"
'â¢ 'Then,' said Lawton. 'why on earth
are you carrying that dog?'
â¢"Well, general,' replied the negro,
showing his white teeth In a broad
grin, 'the dog's tired!' " â From tha

Answers to Queries.
THERE is a strong probability that the course of
the world's events may witness the novel interven
tion of a disease in the arbitrament of tangled af
fairs. Recent word from South Africa has it that of the â¢
first shipload of coolies sent to Durban under the Bal- !
four propaganda for the importation of Chinese labor j
nearly a third became suddenly and fatally afflicted with
the dread Oriental malady beri-beri. Arriving at the
Rand the coolies again suffered from the disease and
twenty-five of their number succumbed. With the
bodies of the unfortunate laborers shipped back to China
as an evil omen the mine owners not only find a hornet's
nest stirred up about their ears in the Transvaal, but are
experiencing, according to the reports of the press, great
difficulty in recruiting a further supply of laborers in
China.
It would appear that the outbreak of this dreaded
plague among the imported coolies is the final drop
destined to crystallize the opposition of all classes of
Afrikanders against the policy of the Balfour Ministry.
Already the Liberals in Parliament have renewed their
fight on the strength of the epidemic's appearance. From
the forces of the outraged colonists in the Rand, quiet
only for the moment under defeat, disturbing mutterings 1
are becoming more audible daily. Recent editorial utter
ances in one of the strongest of New Zealand's opposi
tion organs revives the talk of a Pan-British Staaten
bund for the protection of the colonies in their mutual
interests.
Whether or not the ring of mine owners will succeed
in their attempt at forcing a new element into the al
ready inflammable race question of South Africa must de
pend upon the attitude of the lately subjected Boers no
less than upon the opinion of the recently established
Uitlanders. The men who fought at Modder River and
Spionkop have still to be reckoned with even though
they were thrashed into peace by the brute force of over
whelming numbers. Now that they are not only subject
to a nation their enemy for these hundred years, but
suffer under the ring rule of a clique of rich men who
hold the labor market in the hollow of their* hand, it
cannot be expected by the British Imperial Government
that the Boers will have hearts attuned to all peace and
fealty even under the most favorable conditions. j" V
The conquerors of the Transvaal and the Free State have
not advanced to their new subjects the most ideal condi
tions. Even the home Ministers are prone to the secret
belief that the government of the lately acquired terri
tory is more a modus vivendi than an established order
of things. Now that the peoples so lately dis
possessed have thrust upon them yellow labor and the
fearsome concomitant of the coolie incursion â disease â
students of affairs may await with expectancy develop
[ ments more or less definitely foreshadowed.
Eer mother. Cora. Countess of Straf
ford, it will be remembered, was the
widow of Samuel Colgate, a Xew York
banker, and with her wealth and beau
ty created a mild sensation when she
came to London in the 'SO's. She was
noticeable at evening parties for her
fashion cf wearing in her hair an ex
tremely upstanding white aigrette. She
also started the. style â since become
popularâ of using a riviere of
diamonds, not as a necklace, but as an
ornament, slung across the front of
the bodice of her gown. Her marrlagf
to Lord Strafford was celebrated with
much magnificence, but their wedded
life lasted only five months, the late
Earl meeting with a tragically sudden
death In May, 1SW. Her second widow
hood endured only a few years and she
recently espoused her third husband,
Mr. Martin Kennard.

heiress to boot, the is well qualified to

Hans got out of bed and took the bird
from Hans to put it in a place where
It would not spoil.
She went out into the kitchen, leav

a yell. Rushing out to the kitchen he
gasped aloud. Then he saw and com
menced talking to himself in German.

ally, about midnight, the crowd about
the table yelled like mad. "You win.
Hans, you win!" they shouted.
The proprietor of the place slapped
Hans on the back and congratulated
him. and so every man in the place.
"Set 'em up vonce," said the German,
smiling a pleased smile.
"I will see that you get a peach.
Hans." said the saloon man. "You de
serve it."
"Yaw," said HanL. ' again smiling.
"Let us some more drink have."
"Well, in the small hours of the morn

bundle frcm which dangled a tag read-

times while on his way home. He af
fectionately stroked the protruding
head as he murmured. Arriving at his
home he woke up his spouse.
The annoying fact has been announced that no ar
rangement has been made to pay the German judges of
their countrymen's displays at the St. Louis Exposition.
These experts will have to cross the ocean, give their

aggregating $62,000, simply to extend to us an excep

PRESIDENT J. J. HILL of the Great Northern and
also president of the railroad trust, which the Su
preme Court of the United States dissolved in the
suit brought by President Roosevelt, announces himself
for Parker. That is what was expected. Hill's railroad
trust combined their systems serving the same territory.
They had been created for competitive purposes. The
people had given rights of way, station grounds, town
sites and all sorts of local aid to these lines in order to
get the protection of competition and rival facilities. In
addition to this local aid the Northern Pacific and the
Burlington had Federal land grants.
It is safe to say that without the initial impulse of pub
lic aid, general and local, two of the systems involved
would not be in existence at all. Mr. J. J. Hill and Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan and Mr. Belmont proposed to take'
these properties, created by such means, and put them in
a trust which obsoletcd the competitive purpose they
were built to serve. The rights of the people of several
States were involved. These States were roused, from
Minnesota to Washington. Governor Van Zant of Min
nesota brought an action in the local courts which
proved inefficient. President Roosevelt ordered the De
partment of Justice to bring suit in the Federal courts
under the anti-trust and interstate commerce laws.
It was then that Mr. J. J. Hill proclaimed his intention
to have the President's scalp. He is after it now. That
is what his support of Parker means. He is the owner
of $150,000,000 and will spend it freely to defeat Roose
velt. But it remains to be seen whether money will do
it. It is a time of testing in which men must line up.
The issue is made by the trusts, which have cause for
fighting the President. If the people go with the trusts
in support of Parker they cannot complain that they
were not informed.

The Populists were not alone nor singular in putting
undeserved stress on a legal tender currency. Mr.
Bryan speaking to them in Nebraska in an attack on
the national banks said: "A bank issues its note of hand
and draws interest on it while it is outstanding. You
farmers issue your notes of hand and have to pay in
terest on them while they are outstanding. The law dis
criminates between the corporation and the man. What
is needed is a law that will enable you to draw interest
on your note of hand while it is outstanding." If that
were not a proposition to make a currency out of un
secured personal notes what was it? Mr. Bryan was the
nominee of the Populist party for the Presidency and
spoke by authority.
It must not be understood that we impeach the re
spected shadow of Populism or intend to speak ill of
the dead. It is the experience of all philosophers and
of all benefactors of their kind rejected by the genera
tion of which they are a part, to be selected and honored
by generations follo\\ing, that the most difficult of all
things is to get men to think deeply and soberly about
anything. The great issues of life require thought and
seldom get it. It is therefore the conclusion of the
philosophers that it is better that men should think
wrongly than not at all. When the process of ratiocina
tion begins the integrity of the mind leads thought
aright. To the Farmers' Alliance and the Populists
must be given credit for starting several millions of peo
ple to thinking. In this they far excelled the two old
parties. After all there was more American manhood
in a Populist standing out and giving reasons for the
faith in him than in David B. Hill saying "I am a Dem
ocrat," without knowing why or giving any definition of
the faith.
Populism has passed so suddenly away because Popu
lists began to think and went forward to right thinking
that led them out of vagary into the substance of things.
They enslaved themselves to the idea that artifice by
legislation can do what natural' law does better. Like
many others they were led far astray by the legal ten
der laws. Such laws are not necessary, though they may
provide a convenient measure. Men deal in values by
contract and when A borrows of B they may mutually
agree that a legal tender for the debt shall be bushels of
wheat or dollars of gold weighing so much each. They
establish their own legal tender in their contract.
We may never look upon the like of the Populists
again, but let it be said of them if their ideas were wrong
they had the courage of their convictions.
A CORRESPONDENT writes us chidingly about
our memorial remarks on the passing of the Pop
ulist party. He demurs to the statement that the
Farmers' Alliance was obligated by Mr. Polk to be ex
clusive in its reading and in the speeches to which it
gave ear. As we were not a member we can only sub
mit the testimony of the press, especially of the
Southern press, current at the time.
The organization was an abnormal outgrowth of hard
times and of low prices for farm products. In the af
fairs of this world there are streaks of lean and streaks
of fat, and when we all strike an unusually thick lean
streak we not only think some one has meddled with our
meat, but we are apt to go hunting for a quick and ready
remedy, which is usually the wrong remedy, and while
we are trying to apply it or wondering why it doesn't
work things right themselves, everybody resumes buying
and selling and we forget all about the trouble. This
seems to be the reason why the Populist party has gone
to sleep with its fathers â the Greenbackers and the
Farmers* Alliance.
What use to dispute about what it taught in economics
and finance? It seems to have scouted the idea of in
trinsic value in a medium of exchange. The gentleman
who chides us says that Populists "even professed to be
lieve that all the value of the precious metals, over and
above that created by their use in the arts and sciences,
was pure fiat â a value created by the nations which had
adopted them as convenient material for ese for pur
poses of money.**
No government can create a fiat value except as be
tween itself and its own people who do business with it.
The government may agree to take its taxes in chips and
whangs, and they immediately have a value arising in
that exclusive function. It may even make them legal
tender between individuals for the discharge of con
tracts between debtor and creditor, as it did greenbacks,
but there its power of fiat stops, for the world does busi
ness in a medium of exchange that derives its value
from human desire and not from necessity imposed* by
statute law. Of all the metals and minerals man most
desires gold. All over the world savage and civilized
man, Christian and Pagan, gentle and simple, all desire
gold more than anything else. This universal desire
makes it a universal medium of exchange. It is so by
natural selection. It is by universal desire made a form
of property that is exchangeable for all other forms of
property. The governments did not make it so and they
cannot unmake it. The nations have simply followed
the line of natural selection in making gold, already the
universal medium of exchange, the official standard of
\2lue also. 'J.
The growing of basket willows was j
introduced into the United States some j
sixty years ago by German basket j
makers, who settled in Western Xew I
York and Pennsylvania. They first ;
attempted to use wild willows, but ;
soon abandoned these as Impractic- j
able and imported the purple or Welsh i
willow. They grew the rods and the !
manufacture into baskets was made
profitable by whole families engaging
in the weaving. Their product has al
ways been a cheap variety of basket, j
since they use steam In peeling the j
rods, which gives them an undesir
able dark color. When the industry
was extended farther west and down
to the Baltimore district, Maryland
hand peeled rods were used and a
much higher grade basket manufac
tured. But this country, in the ex
tensive use of willow ware, has never
approached Europe, where are found
not only heavy farm baskets and re
ceptacles made of unpeeled willow,
but market, clothes and fruit baskets
of peeled willow, furniture, hampers
and trunks and most artistically
wrought split willow ware designed
for countless other uses. Could all
these be as cheaply manufactured
here as there their use by us would
doubtless be as extensive as that
across the sea. For willow ware is
not only prettier than its substitutes,
but, what Is still more Important,
lighter and more durable.
Another use for willow in this coun
try Is found in the growing demand
for willow furniture, which has be
come fashionable in the North, while
in the warm climate of the South it
is rapidly taking the place of uphol
stered furniture. Good wages can be
paid in the manufacture of this kind
of furniture. It is a profitable indus
try and steadily growing in Import
ance, while willow basket making has
barely held its own in the last dec
ade. The demand for furniture ma
terial has been met to this time chiefly
j by importing French rods. But this
can be changed if our own willow
growers will adopt more scientific
methods of culture and market their
rods only after they are well sea
soned â not soon after cutting, as is
now customary.
Washington. D. C, where the best spe
cies of basket willows were set out on
different soils and spaced in accord
ance with different methods of plant-
Ing. The results of this research will
shortly be made known by the bureau
in a bulletin entitled The Basket Wil
low."
â¢ The bureau's purpose was to dis
cover a means of reducing the cost of
the raw product, peeled and unpeeled
willow rods, and also of Improving the
quality. This has been definitely as
certained. It Is entirely a matter of
properly regulating the distance be
tween the sets in planting, care in
cutting the crop of rods and In select
ing better species and strains of wil
low. The custom has been to plant
In rows three feet apart, spacing a
foot in the rows between the sets. A
far better plan is to put the rows only
twenty Inches apart and reduce the
; distance between the sets to nine
inches. When this is done and the
crop is cut close to the ground the
rods will be longer and less branchy,
the plants longer lived and the yield
per acre much greater. The initial
cost is slightly higher than under ex
isting methods, but this is more than
offset by the increased* returns. At
present an average production of six
tons of green rods per acre Is excep
tional; by the method now advocated
by the bureau eight or more tons per
acre of better rods can be produced.
When to improved methods of cul
ture the advantages from a choice of
better European varieties of willows
for planting are added the result will
be a marked reduction in the price of
the raw material and a distinct better
ment of the condition of both the pro
ducer and manufacturer.

charge of child stealing. The boy, Al
fonse James, 11 years of age, whom
the Chinese is accused of stealing, was
on the steamer. His father, W. James,
a cook at 2235 Washington street, took
charge of him. The boy's parents are
half Chinese and half Spanish.
San Yen Foo was the cook on the
steamer Spokane. He says the boy
was anxious to go to sea, so San got
him p. job as cabin boy. San spoke
to the captain and was told to bring
the lad aboard for a trial. This state
ment was corroborated by the boy,
who said he did not want his father
to know he was going to sea.
The cook and the boy were arrested
at Port Gamble anl taken to the Seat

1. A low rate of fare: The Santa Fe
round-trip to Yosemite Valley, first
class, costs only $28 50. This saves the
traveler $10 00.
t. No sleeping-car berth required:
The rail Journey is made entirely in the
day time and the traveler is not put to
the expense of a Pullman berth. This
saves $3.00.
S. California Big Trees seen without
side ride: .Santa Fe Yosemite stages
pass directly through two groves of
giant sequoias without side ride or extra
expense. This saves $2 00.
4. Good meals at a moderate price:
Meals along the Santa Fe line to Yosem
ite are most toothsome and cost only BOc
and 75c each. These prices are reason
able and save the traveler on the round
trip about $15 00.
5. Modern stage coaches: Santa Fe
coaches are new-built and especially for
Yosemite service.- They are the newest
and most comfortable running into the
Valley.
6. The Merced Canyon entrance to
Yosemite Valley:" Santa Fe stages go up
into Yosemite Valley the way the river
comes down. This is by far the grand
est entrance to the Valley and passes
Â¦cliits and waterfalls seen on no other
line.
7. The "Double Loop": By an unique
routing Santa Fe passengers are taken
into the Valley one way and out another,

The point is that the filing of an in
formation prior to the hearing of an
application for a writ of habeas corpus
for the release of a prisoner on the
ground of the Insufficiency of the evi
dence takes away that privilege from
the prisoner. Prior to the filing of an
information the defendant is held on a
commitment from the lower court. A
writ would then be in order, but as
soon as the information is filed the
proper mode of procedure is for the
defendant to move for Its dismissal in
the court to which the case has been
assigned.
A nice point of law and practice has
arisen in the case of George T. Bal
linger, who was held to answer on n
charge of felony embezzlement and re
leased on a writ of habeas corpus. On
June 14 the case was assigned to Judge
Dunne's court for trial. The writ was
granted by Judge Graham.
When the case was called to be set In
Judge Dunne's court about three weeks
ago Colonel T. F. Barry, representing
Balllnger, asked that it be continued
pending the decision on the applica
tion for the writ. The Judge plainly
showed his anger because the applica
tion had been made before another
Judge, and Barry explained that it had
been made before the case was as
signed to any court. A continuance
was granted till yesterday, and when
the case was called Barry moved that
the information be dismissed on the
ground that the defendant had been
discharged on the writ.
Judge Dunne curtly denied the mo
tion and made an order setting the
case for trial on July 23. Meantime he
instructed Assistant District Attorney
Whiting to look into the status of the
case. There Is a clash of authority be
tween the two Judges, one discharging
the defendant and the other insisting
upon the case going to trial.
Balllnger was bookkeeper for the
California Art Glass Bending and Cut
ting Works and was arrested on com
plaint of William Schroeder, president
of the company, on a charge of em
bezzlement. He was held to answer
by Police Judge Cabanlss on April 9.
On May 9 an information was filed in
the Superior Court against Ballinger
and the case was assigned to Judge
Dunne's court on June 14.
On the same day that the informa
tion was filed a writ of habeas corpus
was applied for and was made return
able before Judge Graham. The hear
ing was continued from time to time,
and it was not until July 5 that the
arguments were heard. On July 14
Judge Graham granted the writ on the
ground that the evidence was insuffi
cient to hold the defendant and or
dered the defendant released from cus
tody.
Holds That the Defendant
Has Been Illegally Set
Free and Must Face Jury
JUDGE DUNNE OBJECTS
In answer to further questions the
witness replied that, although he was
cashier of the firm at the time of its
failure and had been connected with it
for eighteen years, he did not know
who negotiated the loans.
With the conclusion of Joe's testi
mony the defense rested, and unless.
the prosecution calls witnesses in re
buttal the argument will begin with
the opening of court at 10 o'clock this
morning.
Joe Eppinger was next called to the
stand and Attorney Dunne stated that
he could prove by this witness that it
was Bernard Ettlinger, and not Jacob
Eppinger, who borrowed the money.
Joe was then carefully led through his
movements for the entire day on which
the money was secured up to the time
he v/ent across the bay, on the advice
of his brother-in-law, and bet on the
wrong horse. He corroborated the tes
timony of his cousin, Josua, regarding
the transaction with Beck, saying that
Josua had returned from the bank,
whither he had gone to settle a matter
of insurance, and reported that Beck
was anxious to loan money on Califor
nia wheat. The only other persons
present during this conversation were
Joe and Ettlinger. The cross-examina
tion by District Attorney Byington
showed a peculiar state of mind on the
part of Joe. In answer to a question
regarding the fixing of dates he said:
"The day after the Indictment was
found I told Josua that the indictment
was on a false charge, as it was Ber
nard Ettlinger who made the deal. I
spoke to Ettlinger about it and he
promised to come up to the house and
fix it up, but never did so."
"Whom else did you tell?"
"Attorney Ach."
"Why did not you Inform the District
Attorney's office that your father was
falsely accused, and you - knew tht
guilty party?"
"I did not consider it my place to do
so. I considered the proper parties to
inform were the lawyers."
"Can you remember who negotiated
any other loan?"
"No."
"Yes."
The witness further testified that he
had only seen Bernard Ettlinger once
since the failure. On that occasion
they met In the office of Referee Wads
worth. When asked if he had not
quarreled with Bernard on that occa
sion because the latter threatened to
tell all he knew regarding the failure
Eppinger said: "I tried to talk to him
and he would not talk."
BACKS UP HIS FATHER.
Attorney Dunne then read the testi
mony of Cashier Eastwick in which
he stated that the conversation regard
ing the loan took place in front of his
desk and asked if any such conversa
tion had taken place, to which the wit
ness replied in the negative. After
leaving the bank he visited his office
and reported the transaction to his
partner, Bernard Ettlinger.
"Did you go back to the bank on
April 10?" was asked.
"No, sir."
"Did you ever go back after Feb
ruary 26?"
"No, sir."
The loan on the worthless warehouse
receipts was, according to the testi
mony of Colonel Beck, negotiated in
the bank on April 10.
"Do you know where Bernard
Ettlinger is at present?" was the next
question.
"He is some place in Europe."
"When did he go?"
"Last January."
"Did he tell you he was going?"
"No."
This closed . the direct examination
and on cross-examination by Attorney
Campbell the witness was asked:
"What were you doing on April 10?"
"I can't exactly say."
"Whom did you eee?"
"The people at the office."
"I understand you to say that you did
not see Colonel Beck between February
25 and April 10. Is that a fact?"
hope that you will give us other busi
ness at 5% per c6nt.' "
"Did either or both of you go to the
cashier's desk?" was asked.
"No," was the reply.
Regarding his relations with Colonel
Beck the witness' testimony was a
fiat contradiction of that given by Beck
and Cashier Eastwick of the bank.
Eppinger said that he had known Beck
for about ten years prior to April,
1903. Shortly after the International
Banking Cor. oration opened for busi
ness in September, 1902, Beck and Ep
pinger met on the street and Beck ask
ed Eppinger to give him some business,
to which the letter replied that he
would If he could.
"About the 26th of February," con
tinued the witness, "I saw Colonel
Beck alone in th* office of his bank.
In substance I told him that I was
now in a position to give him some
business as the London, Paris and
American Bank wished me to take up
a loan of $33,000 before March 1 in or
der to avoid paying taxes on It. He
asked what the loan was on and I told
him on grain in Portland. We then
discussed the rate of interest. I did
not want to pay over 5 per cent, but
he wanted 6. He' finally agreed to let
me have the money at 5% with the
proviso that I should give him the bill
of exchange when the grain Â» was
shipped. As I was going out Beck
'said: 'Now that we have started, I
CONTRADICTS BECK.
Joseph's manner of recalling specific
transactions created considerable mer
riment in the courtroom. ' Although he
had worked for the firm for eighteen
years the only business transaction he
could distinctly recall was the one on
which his father was being tried. He
remembered it because on that day he
had asked Ettlinger to give him a
check. Ettlinger refused and Joe took
$80 from the cash drawer, charged it
to his father and played it on a horse
at the Oakland track. The horse came
in third.
At the morning session little was
accomplished. Frank 6. Mitchell was
recalled to the stand and gave further
testimony regarding the books. This
showed that $270,000 had been drawn
from the firm's funds by Jacob Ep
pinger which was not charged to him.
An early recess was taken that the ex
amination cf the defendant might be
proceeded with uninterruptedly and at
2 o'clock he was called to the stand.
Attorney Dunne conducted the direct
examination and his first move was to
impress upon the jurors the age and
feebleness of the defendant. When Ep
pinger's name was called he turned to
Joe and said: "Joe, help your father
to the witness stand." Joe complied
readily with the request and in a few
moments the elder Eppinger was seat
ed on the stand, nervously twirling his
handkerchief and fumbling his cane at
intervals. When the questioning began
all signs of nervousness vanished. In
answer to preliminary inquiries he
gave his nativity as Germany, his age
as 67 years and said he came to this
country in 1S55. He first worked in
Sacramento as a butcher boy and later,
in company with his brother and Ber
nard Ettlinger, embarked in the gen
eral merchandise business, first in El
Dorado County, later in Solano County,
and opened up an office In San Fran
cisco in 1866, which was continued until
the failure of the firm on June 6 of last
year.
PLAYED THE RACES.
And Ettlinger is not here to clear
himself of the charges made against
him.
Joseph Eppinger, the last witness for
the defense, following in the footsteps
of his father, also laid all sins of
omission or commission at the door of
Ettlinger.
Jacob Eppinger, who for a quarter
of a century enjoyed the fullest con
fidence of the business men of the
State, leaning heavily on the arm of
his son, Joseph, walked to the witness
stand yesterday to testiry in his own
defense on a charge of defrauding the
International Banking Corporation.
Knowledge of the fact that one of the
former rulers of the grain market of
the world was to take the stand at
tracted a crowd of onlookers to the
courtroom. They were not men of the
ordinary "bench-warmer" class, but
men prominent in the business com
munity, who stood on tiptoes at the
rear of the courtroom or strained their
necks from less advantageous posi
tions in the low seats, eager to hear
every word spoken by the accused man.
Eppinger's plea, briefly summed up,
was that it must have been Bernard
Ettlinger, the missing partner, who ne
gotiated the loan on the fraudulent
warehouse receipts.
Mrs. Annie Caesar and Mrs. Freda
Sealer, who live in separate houses in
the 700 block of Vermont street, shook
hands yesterday In Judge Mogan'd
courtroom and agreed to call a halt on
the estrangement that resulted in the
arrest of Mrs. Caesar for disturbing
the peace of Mrs. Sealer. This happy
termination of what seemed to be an
interminable feud was brought about
through the united efforts of two at
torneys and the Judge, and was prob
ably precipitated by notification from a
reputable physician that in the very
near future the stork will visit the
Sealer home.
When the case of Young W. Casteel,
charged with having shot and attempt
ed to murder R. W. Durham in a busi
ness college on Golden Gate avenue,
was called before Judge Mogan the de
fendant's attorney obtained a continu
ance until to-day by stating that his
client was ill and unable to appear in
court.
Inga Olesen, wife of an Industrious
porter, residing at 5 Freelon street, was
sentenced to six months' imprisonment
for neglecting her two children, one
aged 4 years and the other 12 months.
Judge Mogan pronounced the sentence
and its severity was prompted by the
fact that the woman proved herself ut
terly worthless. , .
Judge Conlan sentenced John Rich
ards, alias Charles White, to six
months' imprisonment for burglary.
Richards stole some lead pipe from the
basement of a Sutter street residence.
Judge Mogan heard further testi
mony in the assault case of Claude
Alexander, inventor and manager of
the "floating lady" illusion, recently at
the Chutes, who is charged with having
brutally beaten W. H. Nicholson, his
assistant In manipulation of the mys
terious performance. Alexander testi
fied that he had caught Nicholson tak
ing measurements of the paraphernalia
used in presenting the illusion, his evi
dent intention being to duplicate It,
and that when he (Alexander) de
manded an explanation he was struck
with a bucket wielded by Nicholson,
whom he was compelled to strike in
self-defense. The case will be decided
to-day.
that he was abruptly ordered to leave
the witness stand. Lux is a blood rela
tive of the famous cattle baron of that
title..
Judge Conlan dismissed the charge
of larceny entered against Walter Lux
by Algernon Graham, who complained
that he had been robbed of $43 by the
defendant. Graham's testimony and
demeanor displeased the Judge bo much
Judge Megan held Thomas P. Geer
and John Nelson, the youthful burglars
who were nabbed by Mrs. William
Blythe while they were ransacking an
apartment In her lodging house at 511
Taylor street, to the Superior Court,
with ball fixed at $3000 apiece.
â¢ Â« â¢
Elbert C. Laws is endeavoring to re
cover through Judge- Conlan's court a
gold and diamond badge which was
presented to him by Aerie No. 61, Fra
ternal Order of Eagles, of which he is
a past president. The trinket was
pawned by Carl Schwartz for $50, and
Mr. Laws complains that he lent it to
Schwartz, who professed desire to get
one manufactured exactly like It, and
gave that person no authority to dis
pose of it, so he asks the court to
compel the pawnbroker to restore it
to him, as Schwartz has left town.
The pawnbroker's attorney, on the oth
pr hand, states that when Schwartz
pawned the badge he did so at Laws'
request, who was ashamed to borrow
money on the security of a token pre-
Eented to him by his brother Eagles.
It is not the Intrinsic value of the em
blem, Laws says, that makes him
grieve over its loss, but he treasures
it Incalculably on account of the senti
ment It represents. The case will be
heard to-day.
The defendant's attorney pleaded
somnambulism and defied the prosecu
tion to prove anything else. His client,
h-> said, was afflicted with the sleep
walking habit and was greatly sur
prised when he was awakened in Mr.
Leider's apartment to find himself a
prisoner accused of burglary. It was
the enoring of the defendant, argued
the attorney, that first attracted to him
the attention of Mr. Leider and was it
likely that a person contemplating bur
plary would purposely sne-re? No, in
deed, and the snore should be suffi
cient to dispel suspicion of felonious
intent. The prosecution, however,
maintained that the alleged slumberous
snore was in reality the deep breathing
of a wide-awake person so nervous
that his lung action was uncontrollable.
Judge Fritz has given himself until
next Saturday to think over the case.
Somnambulism was the defensive
plea Bet up in behalf of William Ett
lir.ger, on trial before Judge Fritz for
burglary. A. C. Leider, a mail carrier
residing at S33 Eddy street, went to bed
in his room one night recently and
while trying to woo Morpheus was sud
denly restored to full wakefulness by a
sound suggestive of a locomotive ex
haust valve in operation and by sharp
listening he traced the source of the
unwonted noise to the space between
his couch and the floor. Being a cau
tious man, he quietly summoned as
sistance before pursuing his investiga
tion further and several fellow lodgers
who responded to the summons found
William Ettlinjrer lying upon his side
underneath the bed and either sleeping
(. r simulating deep slumber. When they
searched him they found only a bunch
i-f keys, which subsequently were
proven honest keys and his own prop
erty, but upon the strength of the find
they pressed home the charge of bur
elary.
When the case of Adolph Goldman,
charged with having shot R. W. Snow.
a former Mayor of Oakland, was called
in Judge Mogan's court the defendant's
attorney, Frank Murphy, asked for
and was granted a continuance till to
day.
George couldn't obey, of course, and
the bailiff, who kindly undertook to ex
plain that fact to the old lady had a
difficult time of it.
It is needless to add that she refused
to prosecute George, whose plea was
that the cutting of her hand was acci
dental. The case was dismissed and
<ieorge was escorted straight to a bar
ber shop. He had been arrested on
complaint of his sister, who stated that
he was drunk and disorderly in the
family home. 1252 Montgomery street,
when he brandished the knife.
"George Van Tassel, you get right
out of there and go and get your face
shaved!" 6he commanded.
George Van Tassel, arrested on July
13 for cutting his aged and crippled
mother with a knife, did not present a
winsome appearance yesterday morn
ing as he sat among the caged miser
ablos in Police Judge Conlan's court.
Imprisonment had reduced his avoir
dupois and made misfits of his gar
ments, his complexion was bad and
his chin bore a thick growth of tawny
etubble. Of all the unhappy-looking
defendants there was not a less lovely
picture than George Van Tassel.
When ihe mother of the man hobbled
cm crutches into the courtroom her dim
old eyes at once scanned the cage and
its inmates until a pained expression
flashing over her features indicated
that Ehe recognized , her offspring.
"Whatever intention to prosecute she
may have entertained was quickly
melted in maternal sympathy, for there
was a sob in her voice when she spoke.
"Why. George," she exclaimed, ad
vancing to the* barred Inclosure and
extending a hand that trembled, "how
terrible you look!"
George bowed his head, fumbled his
hat and said nothing. Then the
woman's tone of pity gave way to that
of authorityâ the tone which he prob
ably respected ere drink began to dull
his senses and filial love.

About 2250 B. C, Hammurabi, King
of Babylonia, established certain laws
which he embodied into a code, In
scribed upon stone stelae and set up in
the principal cities of the domain. We
are rather inclined to look upon medi
cal legislation as somewhat modern;
that Is because we do not know any
better. In Hammurabi's time medicine
was specialized, surgery was a distinct
branch of the science, quacks and pre
tenders were known and legislated
against. From advance sheets of a
translation of these laws by Professor
Harper, president of the University of
Chicago, we read: "If a physician op
erates on a man (please note that the
physician did not 'operate a case' in
Hammurabi's time) for a severe wound
with a bronze lancet and saves the
man's life, or if he opens an abscess
(in the eye) of a man with a bronze
lancet, and saves that man's eye, he
shall receive ten shekels of sliver' (as
his fee)." But, under the same cir
cumstances, if he causes the man's
death, or destroys the man's eye, "they
shall cut off his fingers." That would
tend to discourage unskilled operators
and experimental operations. In 1508
the Royal College of Surgeons was au
thorized by charter to examine those
who would practice medicine and
physic and to Issue license to those who
were found qualified. This would not
have been done had it not been found
necessary, nor would Hammurabi, 4154
years ago, have had need. to discourage
quacks had they not existed. Yet, in
this year of grace, 1904, there come
those who practice medicine and
physic, and they stand before the high
est court in the State, in the persons of
their attorneys, and say they prefer to
have no law governing the practice of
medicine. This is Indeed a progressive
age, when educated men will strive to
put the commonwealth back of the
time of Babylonia; to make us lose
Â¦what has been gained in 4154 years:â

About twenty fair enthusiasts met
yesterday and reorganized the Ladies'
Annex to the Golden- Gate Tennis
Club. This club at one time had a
large membership list, but has lacked
a leader for some time. Mrs. L. C.
Bozarth, the former president, gave up
the game about a year ago and since
then the fair racket wielders have held
very few tournaments. The young la
dies have at no time lost interest in
the game and are anxious to appear
again in tournament play.
The following officers were elected:
President, Miss Dorothy Weed; vice
president. Miss Vera Crocker; secre
tary. Miss Wocester; treasurer, Miss
Ida Mearns; assistant treasurer, Miss
B. Cully.
All of the new officers are active
players and they will do all In their
power to make the club what it was
when Mrs. Bozarth presided.
Most of the old players at the park
have given, up the game, but there
are many new players who will un
doubtedly develop Into experts. The
lady players on this elde .of the bay
greatly outnumber those * from Ala
meda County, but the latter have al
ways carried off the honors. Many
tournaments Â¦will be held so that play
ers may be developed who can at least,
make a showing against the out-of
town experts.
Heretofore the ladies have received
neither moral nor financial support
from the members of the Golden Gate
Club and some attribute their poor
showing to this. The club will do all
in its power to help the ladies out in
future. ' :^' I

The United States is going about the
work of constructing the Panama canal
In a way characteristic of American
business methods.
It is tradition that the price paid by
the French when they undertook the
digging of the canal was a human life
for every cubic yard of dirt that was
removed. In their fever of haste to
spend the money poured into their cof
fers by the gullible masses of .the
French people â or to make some show
ing at spending itâ the men In chargs
of the De Lesseps enterprise seemed to
take no account of human life, and tha
fatalities from the deadly fevers which
make the isthmus their home were ap
palling.
But we Americans are going at the
thing differently. First of all things
we propose to pay attention to tha
problems of health and sanitation, wlta
a view to making the canal route rea
sonably habitable. To this end Dr. W.
C. Gorgas, who played so Important a
part in driving yellow fever out oj
Cuba, has been sent down to Panama
and Colon to make a thorough study ofi
conditions which have given the isth
mus its bad name before the world.-*

CLEVELAND CAPTURES TWO
GA31ES FROM BOSTONIAXS
That Hanlon has gained In speed
since visiting the Eastern States and
trying conclusions with the boxers
there is the general opinion of those
who have seen him preparing for his
next fight.
The weather was extremely warm at
Larkspur yesterday and Battling Nel
son took things easy. He was up bright
and early, but only jogged five miles.
In the afternoon he did a few gym
stunts and boxed four fast rounds with
Frank Renhouse. Battling had Frank
going, and at any time during the
short engagement would have easily
knocked him out.
Nelson finished the day's work by
breaking the rope of the punching bag
and sending It flying the length of the
gym, over the spectators' heads. He
was weighed late in the afternoon
and tipped the scales at barely 131
pounds,-
Frank Murphy says Nelson will en
ter the arena weighing about 129.
Tuesday afternoon the boys of the
camp sent the following message to
Dave Barry: "Keep your chin down.
Advice from the boys."
Late last night Smiling Metzner re
ceived an answer, which read: "Held
chin down; won in seven rounds. Sign
ed, Dave Barry."
Eddie Hanlon experienced an attack
of the '.'creeps" while making his way
in the dark to his room in Croll's Hotel
Tuesday night, but the tremors were
not due to any thought that the little
boxer might have given to Battling
Nelson, his next opponent.
Hanlon, in company with Trainer
Frank McDonald and several of his
sparring mates, attended Ye Liberty
Theater in Oakland and witnessed a
presentation of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde." Eddie became absorbed in the
uncanny transformations of the brutal
and demoniacal Hyde and upon reach
ing the stairway leading to his lodg
ings in Croll's Hotel began to "see
things." There was one thing Eddie
did not see in the gloom and that was
the banister poet, which he struck
foul. Toby Irwin, who was right be
hind Hanlon, struck a match, when Ed
die remarked, "Well. Toby, I'm not
afraid of Nelson, but that fellow Hyde
has got me going. There are so many,
of him."
Warm weather prevailed In Alameda
yesterday and Hanlon did not work as
much as usual. He walked six miles
with Irwin in' the morning and In the
afternoon boxed two rounds with Fred
Landers and two rounds with Irwin.
He also swatted the bag twenty-one
minutes and manipulated the wrist ma
chine. -
Billy Delaney, the veteran trainer,
who will have charge of Jeff's affairs,
will join the big fellow at Harbia
Springs after the Hanlon-Xelson bat
tle has been fought. Delaney is looking
out for Hanlon also, and when finished
with the little fellow he will be ready
to look after the champion.
It is probable that Jack Munroe will
leave the East for this city in a few
days. The big miner will again train
at Mike Sheehan's Ocean Beach Tavern
and Tim McGrath and Billy Roche will
have charge of things. As usual, Mun
roe will pick up a lot of local heavy
weights for sparring partners.
Jeff will not begin hard work right
away. He does not want to take any
chances with his bad knee and there
fore will be very cautious at first. HÂ«
expects to do a lot of hunting within
the next few days, and when not out
in the woods after deer the champion
will loll about the place until he feels
that he Is fit and ready to begin hard
work.
OAKLAND. July 20.â Champion
James J. Jeffries left Oakland this
morning: for Harbin Springs, where hs
will resume his interrupted training
for his flsht trtth Jack Munroe, which
Is scheduled to take place in San Fran
cisco on August 26. The champion was
accompanied by his wife and his broth
er. Jack Jeffries.
The Injury to Jeff's knee which
caused the postponement of the fl$ht
has entirely healed.- and as the cham
pion boarded the train this morning hs
walked without any trace of a limp.
The big fellow Is In good shape now,
and as he has plenty of time to traia
he Is satisfied that he will be in perfect
condition when he faces the bis miner
a month hence and will be prepared to
give a good account of himself.

CHICAGO, July 20.â Clifton Forge
won his fifth straight victory when he
annexed the third and feature event at
Hawthorne to-day. The little sprinter
was always favorite, backed from 8 to
5 to 11 to 10. and this was one of the
l>est races he ever won. With 10S
pounds up, Helgeson got him away In
front, nnd at no time was the result
in doubt. Princess Tulane, backed from
i> to 1 to 7 to" 2, was a contender
throughout. She kept as close to- the
favorite as she could, but Clifton Forge,
held his lead of a length to the wire.
Princess Tulane got a severe whipping
fiom Knapp and finished gamely, beat
ing Action two lengths for the place.
The second race on the card gave the
jumpers a chance to perform. Creolin,
the favorite, won easily after leading
all the way. He beat Donaml a length.
The latter was four lengths in front of
Weird at the end. The three that fin
ished in front led all the way. It was
a procession for the rest. At the last
jump Sweet Jane fell.
Helgeson rode three winners. The
talent made another cleaning, as three
favorites and three well-backed second
choices won. The track was fast,

Parke Wilson steered his Seattle
charges to the Eighth street lot yester
day afternoon prepared to give Loh
man's tobogganers a beating that
would make the fans up north cheer
for the home team. Wilson had visions
of Mike Fisher weeping in despair over
the loss of the rag and other nice things
that "smokers" are wont to behold.
And the blissful' SDell lasted till the
eighth, when Oakland hammered in. one
more run â Just enough with which to
win the battle. Scoreâ Oakland 5, Seat
tle 4.
Oakland made \>ne of the gamest and
best UDhlll fights seen on the lot this
year. . With the score 4 to 0 against
them In the fifth, the Commuters grad
ually got Jerry to Mr. Hall and kept
easing runs in till the score was finally
a tie. Nor did they stop there.* In the
eighth they made the one which count
ed most and Dut the Siwashes out of
the going, for a day at least.
Seattle opened up with that rush that
is characteristic of a roughhouse ball
team. After Van Haltren was down
Mohler and Delehanty walloped the
ball to right field. Frisk shot a liner
to Schlafley, who returned the f ball to
the plate In a twinkling. If'looked as
though the runner was out, but the
umpire said nay, so Seattle was one to
the good for a starter.
The fans thought the game was
broken up for fair in the fifth, when
Wilson beat a bunt and Hall rested
sa/ely on Buchanan's error. Van Halt
ren's sacrifice advanced both and Mah
ler's single scored them. Then Dele
hanty swung through to center with a
long two-bagger and Mohler arrived,
making It 4 to 0.
Oakland got busy in the same round.
A base on balls, a hit and a couple of
Infield outs gave the Commuters two
to start with. They quit then till the
sixth, when another one was pulled off
by Dunleavy's daring work on the bags.
He hit safely and Schlafley lined the
ball at Hall. The latter threw to Moh
ler, who dropped the sphere. Dunleavy
overran the bag, and as he tried to get
back again Mohler made a stab to
touch him. Then Dun rushed for third,
and Schlafley, who had nearly reached
second, started back again for first.
The whole Seattle team got into the
field in an endeavor to run Dunleavy
down. But the nervy one managed to
escape them all, and was safe at third
when the visitors turned their attention
to getting Schlafley. But he, too, was
a slippery one, and while the whole
bunch was running him down Dunleavy
started for the plate and reached It in
safety before the ball, Schlafley going
to second.

Suddoii Death of a Merchant.
Point Montara is about fifteen miles
south of Point Lobos. It Is the seaward
end of a spur from Montara Mountain
and its rocks and ledges are exceeding
ly dangerous In thick weather. There
Is a light and fog signal on the north
end of the point. The steamship Colo
rado went ashore there November 9,
1868, and the ship Aculeo was lost on
the reef in 1873. The Government has
been petitioned to establish a life-sav
ing station on Point Montara.
On arriving here Captain Tuttle re
ceived orders from the department de
.taching him from the Manning and no
tifying him that he would be relieved
by Captain C. C. Finger, now com
manding the cutter Rush at Seattle.
The Maggie arrived last night and
moored at Mission No. 1. Captain
Coming's statement did not materially
differ from that of Captain Tuttle. But
the crew, however, state that they will
file claims for salvage,, as the cutter
was Btranded and the Maggie pulled
her Into deep water and safety. They
affirm that the Manning signaled for
the assistance she received from the
coasting steamer. It Is thought along
the front that their claims are good.
Ready for Her Trial.
The new battleship Ohio, which- was launched Â¦

The two vessels continued on their
way to this harbor, the Manning drop
ping anchor in her old berth off Sausa
lito-apnarently none the worse for her
trip ashore.
Captain Tuttle was Interviewed on
the quarterdeck of his vessel shortly
after she arrived. He was overjoyed
at the all-round good luck that kept his
ship and himself from lengthening their
Btay on Montara reef. A variation of
the compass steered him into a fog
shrouded shore. From the incident the
captain pointed a moral that, no differ
ence how careful, how experienced a
coast shipmaster may be, he is never
clear of the danger of wreck. He said:
Forty-four years I have safely navigated
thcee bays and Inlets, and on my last cruise,
almost within fight of harbor. I ro on th<Â»
beach.. Kbw did It happen? Well, tlrnt. the
tog- second, I was a half mile farther in shore
than I thought- I could not hear the Montara
whistle though I was almost on>Jt, when I
could hear the hern at Pipeon Point, twenty
olffht mJles to the south. I have heard much
complaint about that Montara .fog whistle that
doesn-t whistle when it la fojrsy. I knew tha
tide would float me, and. even If the Maggie
had not ccme. I would have gone oft under my
own cteam. I gave the captain of the Maggie
*.V> for his good work. The cutter was not in
jured and does not leak.
When the fog lifted about 10 o'clock
the captain found his position was on
Colorado reef, south of Montara Point.
The roasting steamer Maggie. Captain
Corning, bound for San Francisco, ven
tured in elope to the Btranded treasury
cutter and offered assistance. It was
accepted and a line was made fast to
the Manning, and the tide having risen
considerably her bow was slewed
around toward the sea and the Maggie
pulled her off into deep water.
The Daniel Manning left Monterey at
midnight, steaming slowly and hugging
the beach, as is a part of her coast
patrol duty? When north of Pefcadero
the fog came in thick enougrh to shave
with, and the cutter was put on a knot
and a half speed. As he neared Mon
tcra Captain Tuttle listened for the
whistle on the point, but states that he
could not hear it. though the Pigeon
Point horn, twenty-eight miles away,
was booming loud through the fog. It
v.as very quiet, sea smooth, little wind
and no sound coming from the surf off
the starboard. Suddenly a slight grind
ing was felt and heard and the vessel
rubbed sidewise on the rocks. Cap
tain Tuttle, who was on the bridge
when she took the ground, reversed the
engines, but she could not be moved.
This was at S:40 a. m. There was very
little swell and the vessel appeared to
be resting lightly amidships on a
smooth bottom. Captain Tuttle, know
ing that the tide would soon begin to
rise and the cutter would float, put out
a kedge anchor to hold her off shore
and waited.

the little smoking bee was a famous
success.
To-day Lieutenant Beverly C. Daly

After the reception, at which many
smart gowns were seen, the happy

lake passage for Alaska, returning on
the Spokane in* three weeks.
After a short visit with the bride's
parents Mr. and Mrs. Rawlings will
depart for the southern republic,
where the groom is interested in the
Fan Luis mine in Sinaloa. The min
ing regions of Mexico are not exactly
alluring settings for ordinary honey
moons, but are ideal spots for such as
these, where each will be all unto the
other.
The groom, who for some unfath
omable reason is never permitted the
support of more than one attendant,
had Moulton Warner by his side. The
ushers were four handsome chaps,
Uoyd Baldwin. Sidney Pringle, Isaac
Upham and William Smith.
The bride was given into the koep

and carrying bouquets of marguerites.

Mrs. Emily A. Warren, wife of the
Rev. Dr. James H. Warren, died at
1:30 o'clock yesterday morning at her
residence, 1544 Taylor street, and al
though in delicate health for some
time death came quite suddenly.
Only last Sunday morning Mrs.
Warren attended service at the First
Congregational Church and early
Monday morning awoke complaining
of great pain. While there was some
indication of improvement toward the
evening Mrs. Warren gradually sank,
the end being peaceful.
In 1850 Mrs. Warren arrived in San
Francisco as a bride, Dr. Warren sub
sequently removing to . Nevada City.
He later accepted the editorship of
The Pacific and during all his work as
pastor and editor he found an active
adviser in his- wife, who took an ear
nest part in charitable work. No one
worked harder for the foundation of
the Protestant Orphan Asylum in this
city than did the lamented lady.
i)r. Warren and four children and
two grandchildren survive her. In ac
cordance with her wish the funeral
services will be perfectly simple. The
date of the interment has not yet been
decided. >. ,V>

PATENTED) '
In Estes Pofisfed . and Engraved Turned-Wooden Boxes
' These are the genuine "WORLD'S FAIR" Toothpicks, put up in handsomely engraved
and polished boxes. The engraving is in colors, directly on the wood (not a label), and the
I boxes are hand polished in the natural color of the wood, thus displaying to the best advantage
the fine grain of the silver white birch from which they are made. In a word, it makes a very
artistic package, and the most attractive novelty of this kind yet produced.
The "WORLD'S FAIR" Toothpicks themselves are so familiar as. to hardly need de-
scriptionâthey are rounded, polished and sliverless, and admittedly the finest and most popular
American pick- on the market, and are sold in every section of this country. ? ',
In Polished
The above cut is fac-simile of the package and exact size of box. The cover is engraved
in red and black, and as the cut reads. The box has a very neat appearance, and is rilled with
about 300 of these popular, high-class toothpicks. When empty box makes a very suitable re-
ceptacle for hairpins, cuff, collar buttons, etc., and is a valuable and ornamental addition to any
dresser. The premiums are free to Want Advertisers in Sunday Call only. Gifts given Thurs- â¢
day, Friday and Saturday.

So long-ago as 16SS there is a record
of a wreck on Rockall. In Martin's
"Voyage to St. Kilda," published in
1698, Is mentioned a crew of French
men and Spaniards whose ship was
wrecked at Rockall in 1688 and who
made their way in their overladen pin
nance to St. Kilda, where they were
hospitably received.
Lost $10,000 Dollar Bill.
Nearly fifteen years ago a man en
tered the First National Bank of Den
ver and walked into the office of David
H. Moffatt, the president of the bank.
He had a bottle in his nand that he
said contained nitro glycerin and
threatened to blow up the bank unless
he was given a large sum of money.
Mr. Moffatt sent for the money and
among the bills was one of $10,000 de
nomination. Recently the Government
called in all ten thousand dollar bills
and the one given by Mr. Moffatt is
the only one that has not been pre
sented for redemption. No trace of the
man who got the money was ever
found. â New York Tribune. ,

East Molins Bank in the East Moiine
building of East Moiine, 111., was en
tered by robbers at 2:15 this morning;
the entire front of the building: was
wrecked by an explosion of dynamite
near the vault Details as to the
amount obtained are not as present
ascertainable.
The watchman at the Malleable
Iron Tyorks felt the concussion and
saw two men dash into a buggy and
drive away. In the confusion caused
by a passing freight train he could
not get a good description of them.

The Norge did not have to get far off
her course to strike the ledge, as It
lies almost directly in the path of a
vessel coming from the Pentland firth,
as the Norge did, and sailing south
westerly to strike the track of the
trans-Atlantic steamers. The pilot
chart of the North Atlantic issued by
the United States Hydrographlc Office
has the outward track of steamers sail
ing frc-m the Pentland firth charted to
pass sixty-three miles north of the
rock. As a matter df fact, many ves
sels, In order to make a saving In dis
tance, although a comparatively small
one, pass to the south.
A comparatively small number of the
trans-Atlantic ships navigate in the
vicinity of this reef. It Is passed by
such ships as ply between America
and Scandinavian ports and is visited
by the steam trawlers that cruise about
in the North Sea. The great bank at
the base of this reef has j long been
known as good fishing ground. Some
time prior to 1S61 the reef was found
to be surrounded by considerable
shoals of the larger kinds of fish, but
a company formed in that year to
carry on a fishery there proved a fail
ure. The steam trawlers, however, find
the business profitable.
The opinion is expressed by persons
familiar with that locality that the
wreck was probably due to a fog, the
Rockall is 184 miles west of St. Hilda,
the diminutive island which is the most
westerly of the Hebrides, and 290 miles
from the nearest point of the Scottish
mainland. It is 260 miles north of Ire
land. The rock stands in a sand bank,
which is about seventy or eighty fath
oms below the surface. This bank is
about fifty miles long and twenty-five
miles broad. "The exact location of the
rock is 57 degrees 36 minutes north lati
tude and 13 degrees 41 mlnutea west
longitude.
The fact that there is nothing but
rock above water accounts for the
name of the reef. The statement in
dispatches from London that the rock
looks in the distance like a ship un
der full sail is borne out by the ob
servations of sailors who have visited
those seas. The upper part of the rock
is covered by deposits of sea fowl,
making it appear white in the distance.
The base is .dark colored like the hull
of a vessel.
A granite rock, rearing its white
head seventy feet above the sea, of
rounded form and only about 100 yards
in circumference, is all that is to be
seen of the islet of Rockall, the reef
on which the Danish steamer Norge
was wrecked June 28. Far out to sea
it stands as If it' was the last outpost
of Europe. Although it is now com
pletely isolated from the coast of Scot
land, from which it is due west, the
reef, in some prehistoric age, may have
been a part of that rugged country
broken off by some subterranean erup
tion or by the incessant wearing of th.e
waves. - -â¢;. â¢ 'â¢

These are pledges of freedom of trade
between the two countries and official
recognition of the right of the British
Government's representative to exercise*
his functions In Tibet.â Washing Cor
respondence Chicago Tribune.
The inquiries of the State Depart
ment Into the object of the British
Tibetan expedition appear to have de
veloped the rather curious fact that
the British home government was luke
warm if not absolutely indifferent In
the matter of sending Younghusband's
expedition toward Lassa.
Indeed, it is said here that Colonel
Tounghusband was allowed to go for
ward only to save the pride of Viceroy
Curzon. The latter fancied that he had
not been treated with proper consid
eration by the half-wild Tibetans, and.
failing to secure what he deemed due
official recognition of the representa
tives of the Indian Government sent by
him Into Tibet, he appealed to the
home government for an armed escort
to secure proper treatment for his en
voys, and the home government re
luctantly assented.
It is said here that the British Gov
ernment already has indlcatedHts will
ingness to withdraw this punitive ex
pedition as soon as it can obtain from
the Tibetans promises" of yielding the
points which were at issue between In
dia and Tibet before the expedition
crossed the border of the latter coun

fian Francisco.CHICAGO. July 20â At the opening of the
trading Ac-day sentiment ln the wheat pit was
decidedly bullish. Initial quotations on Sep
tember, were op %Â«Â»%c to. %@%c.at SSUc to
88V4C. The causes for this feeling of strength
were heavy rains during the night in Iowa
Nebraska, Kansas and . Indiana and a sharp
advance at Liverpool In' the face of the weak
ness here yesterday. A possibility of trouble
arising between Great Britain and Russia was
the main factor ln the foreign nfarket. The
low point on September was reached at 8684c.
Final figures were at S7Â©87Hc July sold be
tween 93c and 96c and closed at 93%c
In sympathy with. the .strength of wheat a
firm feeling prevailed ln the corn pit at ! the
opening but .. the market soon turned weak
September opened %c to Uc higher at 49Â«ic
to 49%c, sold off to 49c and closed at 49U
049 We .,-....
Liquidation by local holders, due to the
slump in other grains, caused an easier tone
In oats. After opening a shade lower to a
shade higher at 33c to 33 He, September sold
down to 32Â«Jc and closed at 32 %c. -
Uncertainty regarding the stockyards strike
together with heavy receipts of hogs and lower
prices Â¦ at the : yards, caused weakness In pro
visions. At the close September pork was

' "Early cablea wen* sharply higher and Con
sols again lower. These, with some showery
weather in the West, made a strong opening
at higher prices. Later, however, the report
of probability of an amicable adjustment of
European political conditions turned the at
tention to conditions nearer home. Liberal re
ceipts of wheat in the Southwest markets was
the most apparent and. most Important feature.
The arrivals are not meeting with a good de
mand, as. buyers seem to hold off in view of
the great discount on the future months. This
Is making a declining market for cash Wheat
and for the July. The seaboard reported for
eign bids for future shipment at rather nearer
current quotations, but with nothing done.
With political influences out of the situation,
we seemed to have reached the time when the
movement of new Wheat Is likely to place the
market In a less artificial condition. Pending
the effect of this â¢ movement and the adjust
ment of the relations of supply and demand,
considerable uncertainty must result. The Sep
tember and December -Wheat" is being fairly
well bought, but with declining prices for the
cash Wheat and the July options these are
still likely, to bÂ« subjected to some pressure.
We rather look for a> vacillating market in
these futures for the time being.'
In this market futures were higher and the
cash grain was firm. It was reported on
â¢Change that the farmers In the Sacramento
Valley have become very- decided in . their
views ' and are refusing - to sell under $1 25
there, which is equivalent to $1\3S% at Port
Costa. The feeling Is very strong all over the
State, as all Interests agree that the crop will
turn out comparatively light.

but the market developed some points of 1
marked strength and overcame the depressing i
effect of the Red Sea incident on the foreign
exchange. This was seemingly Ignored as com
pletely as were last week's alarming reports of
I damage to the wheat crop and the Inauguration '
i of the meat handlers' ctrlke. The demand
I proved ample to absorb the offerings for Lon
j don account, and fractional recessions were
i quickly recovered. The speculative leaders
I watched* the course of the market with appa
rent complacency until the London liquidation
was concluded, when they resumed aggressive
operations for the advance.. The market then
resumed the character which it has displaced 1
consistently all through thÂ« recent risr. of j
brisk adjpances in a few influential stocks, with 1
steady profit-taking sales at points which have
pre\'iously advanced. The role of leader- again
reverted to Union Pacific, which stock has been
the backbone of the recent riee throughout.
i "lips" were freely circulated - and the , stock
j was to touch par during the. day, thus lndicat-
I ing a spwilative origin for a part of the deal
ings. There was no news bearing on the stock
beyond yesterday's rejection of Union Pacific
overtures of a tettlement out of court of the
Northern Securities dispute and the formal au
thorization of thÂ»$l<V>,000.000 of Southern Pacific
preferred stock by the stockholders during the
day. Neither cf these was news in the pense
understood in the Ftock market, operations hav- j
ing already been conducted in the stocks with |
a knowledge of these events. The movement
ln Southern Pacific wa% apparently ln sympathy
with that ln the parent stock. The general
market was rather slow to respond to theÂ»e
ad\-nnces end "there waÂ» a larpe 1 volume of
profit-taking at about last night's level under
cov?r of the movement ln the Pacifies. There
was no news to account for the sudden letting
down, and a rush to take profits, owing to
srowing skepticism of the stability of the mar
ket, waf the generally supposed cause of the
weakness. Reductions of 1 to 2 points general
] ly wiiTed out the earlier gains and established
considerable net losses ln some important
storks. Bonds were firm. Total sales par
value, $3,765,000. United States bonds' were
unchanged on call. 4

The circular of Somers & Co. saya of Hay:
â¢. T ? r^ as been qult Â« a rush of Hay to
market during the past week, the total being
4800 tons, in comparison with 3000 tons tot
mnÂ«:t W f e^ P^ eCedlnB - We had thought that
most of tho farmers would hold back until the
st Â°f Au Â«ust. but we find that many of them
seem disposed to unload at prevailing prices,
bo that shipments are showing a steady In
crease. This has naturally resulted in a
weakening in prices and we note that to-day
quotations are at least 50o per ton off. The
choicer grades of Hay naturally meet with the
readiest sale; the medium grades are in some
what excessive supply and dragging badly. As
there Is still a great quantity of Hay which
I cannot find warehouse room, we expect a con
tinuance of heavy shipments for several weeks
to come.
"We have to report a .somewhat unusual
condition of affairs here, and that Is the very
I slack demand for Hay, which at this particular
time of the year is generally very heavy. The
genera] report of trade conditions Is a bit dis
couraging, for most of the wholesale houses
complain of very light orders, with the con
sequence that the teaming business hero Is
very dull. This has resulted ln many horses
being turned out, all of which materially
lessens the consumption of Hay.
"It has been reported that the farmers are
organizing In many districts, with the Idea
â¢ of regulating the price of Hay. We do not
anticipate any extremely low figures this sea
son, but we believe the range will be some
what below the average of last year. The law
of supply and demand will prevail, although
the farmers can to a certain extent keep prices
from dropping to too low an ebb."

New Potatoes continued to arrive freely and
the quotations for river Burbanks had a wider
range. The best offerings were firmly held, but
low-grade stock in sacks, which constituted
the bulk of the receipts, was ottered at easier
prices. Local trade was of a light Jobbing
character, but there was fair inquiry for cheap
stock for shipment to the Southwest as the
lower prices made it possible for dealers to
ship at a profit. Receipts of Onions con
tinued light and the market ruled firm, at a
further advance.
Miscellaneous vegetables were in free sup
ply and Lima Beans. Tomatoes and Chile Pep
pers were quoted lower. The ruling price for
fresh arrivals of Cucumbers and ! Summer
Squash was 25c per box. while there was
plenty of old stock to be had at 10?Jl5c. Bell
Peppers were firm at the prices established on

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The weakness In Butter continues and re
ceipts art excessive. Almost all houses are
extremely anxious to sell, as their stocks are
getting unmanageable, and some are forced to
store to get - rid of their surplus, though It
goes against the grain to etore at present
prices Close and posted buyers can fill their
wants at 20c and dairy descriptions are lo
lower. .
The situation in Cheese remains as before
stated.
Eggs are steadily weakening and posted buy
ers say that they can get all the ranch they
want at 26@27c. Most of the trade are rather
looking for. a decline. Stocks are too large
and the demand is slow, though with the open
ing of the schools next week a good many
people will return to town, when the demand
may improve.
Receipts were 100,400 lbs Butter, 1405 cases
Eggs and 18,100 lbs Cheese.

ln pretty good shape for sellers under lighter'
receipts of several varieties and a good demand
for local and n>ar-by account. As previously

There- were "about 500 baskets of early yellow

from Martinez sold In small parcels to the
regular trade at 3c per pound and some fancy
Royals from the Wataonvllle region were
firmly held at the same figure. Offerings In
small packages were neglected and prices were
largely nominal. Bartlett Pears continued to

The attorney for the stable owner
then attacked the constitutionality of
the law of 1903 regarding the injunc
tion of unions for . acts in connection
with trade disputes. He held that it
was unconstitutional under the pro
visions of both the State and Federal
constitutions, chiefly because it Is spe
cial legislation and interferes with the
right to protect property in the courts.
The limit of the rights of labor
unions, Mr. Van Ness pointed out, is
reached when they seek, through
peaceful means, to better their condi
tion. It rests with them, he continued,
whether their object will be attained.
If they continue to coerce and threaten
and abuse; if they lend their aid to
those that injure and maim and mur
der, as they have done in the past,
there can be but one result. The Gov
ernment will declare all so-called labor
organizations to be nothing more nor
Ies3 than criminal conspiracies and
they will be disbanded wherever found.
In conclusion Mr. Van Ness said:
"The right of people to conduct their
affairs without interference Is a natural
right and one the law recognizes. The
courts are going to protect the free cit
izens of this country in the exercise
of this right and to do it they will ex
ercise the power of injunction. I ad
mit and recognize the fact that labor
unions have the right to fix the hours
its members shall work and the wages
they shall be paid if they can find em
ployers that are willing to accept the
same, but they have no right to de
mand that they be accepted and to riot
and murder if they are refused."
At the conclusion of Mr. Van Ness'
argument the case was continued until
this morning at 10 o'clock.
The side of the Citizens' Alliance
and the stable owners in the test case
involving the right of labor unions to
institute boycotts and commit other
alleged unlawful acts against business
enterprises declared "unfair." was pre
sented to Judge Hunt yesterday in the
argument of T. C. Van Ness. To-day
Judge Magulre will set forth the side
of the Stablemen's Union. The case
has occupied much of Judge Hunt's
time for the past two weeks and gen
eral interest has been manifested in
It by those for and against the meth
ods of unions.
E. G. Pierce, owner of the Nevada
Stable, sued for an injunction against
the Stablemen's Union and pending the
decision in the case obtained from
Judge Hunt an order restraining the
union and its members from placing
pickets in front of his place of busi
ness and committing acts of violence.
Mr. Van Ness opened his argument
yesterday morning with a citation of
decisions of the New York Court of
Appeals and of Federal Judge Thayer
of the Eighth Circuit, both holding
that the acts of unions tending to In
jure persons, business or property were
illegal and that the employer Is en
titled to the protection of the law.

The plea was self-defense and the
Supreme Court intimates that the de
fendant should have been aquitted on
the legal evidence presented.
The Supreme Court has granted a
new trial to Hulbert R. Wright, who
k'.lied Henry C. Farley on May 23,
1S03. at Yankee Hill, Butte County,
in a rifle duel over the victim's di
vorced -wife. Evidence presented by
the prosecution showing undue inti
macy between Mr?. Farley and the de
fendant is held to have been Irrelevant
and prejudicial. Wright was sen
tenced to ten years* imprisonment.
The defendant and the deceased had
had trouble over Mrs. Farley several
times before the shooting. The woman
had secured a divorce from her hus
band, but he continued to be jealous
of her. On the day of the tragedy
Farley appeared at his former wife's
house unannounced and threatened to
kill Wright, who was visiting her.
Wright fled and Farley commenced
shooting from the porch. Then
Wright, who was carrying a rifle,
turned and shot down his assailant

Thomas Lester was employed in
the City Street Sweeping De
partment. He was called as usual
The first notice taken of the fire was
by R. W. Martland of 738 Mission
street, who saw smoke pouring out
of the windows about 10:30 a. m. He
rang for a chemical, which promptly
appeared on the scene, and ladders were
run up to the building. Captain Sayers
made an inspection, but found no
fire. He retraced his steps and was in
the act of driving away when a man
appeared at an upper window yelling
"Fire!" An alarm was then sent in
for the department. Captain Sayers
and his men again ran up their lad
ders and dragged their hose with them.
The smoke of the fire, combined with
the fumes of the sulphur, made it al
most impossible to work in the build
ing.
Dozens of ladders were stuck up
against the burning structure and tor
rents of water poured In by Hie depart
ment. After an hour's hard fight the
fire was drowned out.
For a time it looked as though the
flames would be carried by the strong
westerly wind into the Thomas Day
Company building at 719-725 Mission
street, but they were checked before
they reached it. The upper floors of the
Day building weVe filled with smoke,
but it is not thought the damage will
be much. The stock of gas and elec
tric fixtures, etc., is valued at $300,000
and is all of a delicate nature, easily
damaged by smoke and water.
A disastrous fire accompanied by
death occurred yesterday at the Model
lodging-house building, 737 Mission
street. The loss will run into many
thousands. The unfortunate man who
lost his life was Thomas Lester, who
was suffocated while trying to make
his way to the street.
The lodging-house and the stores un
derneath were completely deluged by
the great volume of water the depart
ment was compelled to throw on the
flames before it got them under con
trol. The lodging-house was a cheap
resort, containing about 500 rooms, 200
of which were occupied. Had the fire
occurred at night the loss of life would
probably have btcn preat.
The cause of the fire is more or less
a mystery. A portion of the house was
being fumigated* and it is supposed the
sulphur which was being burned in
iron pans may have set fire to the
woodwork.
Relative to the petition of the Ray
mond Granite Company for a per
mit to construct a spur track on Utah
street, the board decided to take no
action on such petition until a suit
now on trial in the Superior Court is
decided to determine the power of the
Supervisors to order the granting of
the permits.
Inspector Griffin was directed to no
tify property-owners on Fourth street
maintaining sub-cellars under the
sidewalks to move them back forth
with, as it is purposed to widen the
roadway of the street at once.
The Board of Works yesterday
adopted the specifications prepared by
the City Engineer for the extension,
grading and macadamizing of Nine
teenth avenue, between Trocadero
road and Ocean avenue, and the secre
tary was directed to request the Su
pervisors for authority to do the work
at an estimated cost of $5000.
The application of the San Fran
cisco Construction Company to do
street work on Sixth avenue, between
I and J streets, was denied, for the
reason that the city will be liable for
a portion of the work and no provision
was made in the budget to meet the
expense of work performed in front
of city property. The board will pe
tition the Supervisors to appropriate
$20,000 for such work.
The resignation of John Johns", as

PREPARES TO EXTEND
NINETEENTH AVENUE
A telegraphic dispatch yesterday
from Reno announced that Oddie and
his young wife had separated and it
toJd of the husband's hasty flight to
this city, where he was supposed to
be in conference with attorneys re
garding his contemplated suit.
The dispatch contained one error and
that was the confounding of Mrs. Od
die'B mother, formerly Mrs. Clara Bell
McDonald, with the mining man's
wife, who is about 22 years of age.
Shortly after their arrival here yes
terday Mrs. Scoville and Gardner con
veyed to Oddie their desire to meet him
and the mining man joined them at
the Palace in the forenoon and was in
conference with his wife's relatives
for some time. It was reported later
that Oddie steadfastly refused to enter
tain a suggestion of reconciliation and
intimated that he would file his suit for
divorce in Nevada in a few days.
Mrs. Helen M. Scoville of New York
and P. S. Gardner of Carson City.
aunt and uncle of Mrs. Clara Oddie,
whose husband, the millionaire mining
man of Tanopah. is reported to be pre
paring to sue his wife for divorce,
arrived here yesterday morning from
Reno and are registerd at the Palace
Hotel. The sole purpose of their hur
ried visit to San Francisco is to effect,
if possible, a reconciliation between
Oddie and his wife, who were married
but a few months ago.
At a conference yesterday morning
between the master brewers and the
men $21 a week with 65 cents fiou^r
for overtime was offered by the own
ers. This offer was unanimously ac
cepted by the Breweryraen's Union at
a meeting held in the evening.
A notice was posted in the quarters
of the union ordering all the men to
return to work to-day. The agreement
will be formally ratified to-night. It
is to last for two years. This com
promise ends a strike that threatened
to be a long and bitter one. It might
have involved a number, or unions had
it lasted.
The bookbinders settled their differ
ences with their employers .yesterday.
The apprentice question was amicably
settled.
The brewery employes' strike is off.
All differences are adjusted and the
men return to work to-day.
The heaviest loss probably falls on
the Holmes Book Company. According
to the statement of the manager, H. G.
Lambert, the stock was w.rth in the
vicinity of $25,000. It is all more or less
damaged by water. Robert Holmes,
the owner, is In Los Angeles, and as
the Insurance policies were In his safe
deposit vault the amount of the Insur
ance carried could not be ascertained.
The Pioneer paper box factory, on
the second floor in the rear of 727 Mis
sion street, was badly gutted by water
and also damaged by fire. The factory
belongs to the estate of C. Thiebaut,
deceased. The business is being man
aged by his son, E. Thiebaut, who
stated the loss to be about $1500.
Sperry's Wire and Iron Works, 'at 735
Mission street, was damaged' by water,
but the prompt action of the fire patrol
In covering up the heavy machinery on
the floor prevented what would. ' have
otherwise been a serious loss.: ""â¢Â«Â«'Â«
The L. H. Butcher Company, at 741
Mission street, also suffered a water
damage to their paints', and oils. W.
D. Colt,, the manager,: estimated the
stock to be. valued at $10,000,, with In
surance of $8000. He thought his loss
was between < 25 and 50 per cent of the
valuation.
M. Rosenbaum, who keeps a.second
hand store at 739 Mission street, states
his stock is completely ruined. He car
ried an Insurance of $1000, which' he
said would hardly cover his loss.

and sometimes not returning until next
morning. On June 9, without notice,
she went to Seattle for "her health,"
and the husband did not know where

come home.
OTHER DIVORCES.
Other divorces were granted yester
day by Judge Kerrigan to Fred-JC.
Miller from Harrlette E. Miller, oifjphe
ground of cruelty; to Day S. Hutchins
from Estelle Hutchins, for desertion;
to Mary A. Bird from Thomas E. Bird,
for cruelty.
Suits for divorce were filed by Alblna
Henry against ChÂ»rles Henry, for
desertion; Mary Buchanan against
James W. Buchanan, for neglect;
James Gardner against Annie Gardner,
for cruelty; Matilda O. , de Lorenzo
against Emanuel A- Lorenzo, for cruel
ty. In the Gardner case the husband
alleges that they were married July 1,
1902, and that on June of last year she
commenced to frequent public dance
halls with strange men. One evening
she did not come home and he found
her in the Golden Gate Fark with a
strange man. When he reproached her

The transition from housekeeper at
a salary of $15 a month to wife without
pay proved an unsatisfactory change
for Lydla E. R. Bailey, wife of James
S. Bailey, a soapmaker. They were
wedded on last St. Valentine's day, and
yesterday she commenced a suit for di
vorce on the ground of cruelty. The
five months of married life was a real
ity far below the rosy promises made
by Bailey when he importuned Mrs.
Wadhams to become his helpmate.
Two months before the wedding she
had entered his employ as housekeeper,
the family consisting of Bailey, an
adult son and an adopted daughter 13
years old. Mrs. Wadhams had a 14
year-old eon, Roy, and she says that
Bailey promised to clothe, feed and ed
ucate him if the mother would marry.
She accepted the offer, and now de
clares Bailey immediately commenced a
system of neglect and abuse. He used
vile language, was addicted to strong
drink and was an Inveterate smoker of
"vile tobacco."
Furthermore, says she, he was slov
enly and uncleanly in his habits, and
would go three or four weeks without
bathing, notwithstanding that he
worked in his son's "soap factory and
reeked with the filth of the place. In
addition to this the stepdaughter be
came arrogant and impudent. On June
15 Mrs. Bailey left the home at 1127
Silver avenue, and avers that Bailey
offered her $250 if she would not go into
the courts. She says that he is earning
$65 a month, has about $2500 in bank
and owns . shares In the South San
Francisco Masonic Hall Association.
She demands $35 a month alimony, and
secured an order from Judge Troutt re
straining Bailey from disposing of his
property pending the hearing of the
suit. ' .
GRIPMAX IS CRUEL.
Maud Potter's lot was not a happy
one after she married George H. Potter,
a United Railroads gripman, on May
27, 1900. In her complaint for divorce
she says that almost immediately after
their marriage he commenced his abuse
by complaining of her housekeeping
and cooking. In November, 1903, they
were living In "a lonely and sparsely
settled" part of Berkeley, and he would
not come home until the early morning
hours. In March last he is said to have
threatened to kill her, and to have re
peated the threat on various occasions
up to July 10. when she took refuge In
her father's home. After that he made
so much disturbance in the neighbor
hood, she says, that her father had to

but was not to any extent under the
influence of liquor. That was the last
seen of him until Captain Sayers and
Lieutenant Ceder, who were crawling
upstairs on their hands and knees,
butted into Lester, who was also on
his hands and knees, trying: ' to
crawl downstairs. They immediately
carried him downstairs, but he died
before they reached the street.

With the same effort to avoid notice
evidenced when his suit for divorce
was (lied, Peter Lamb appeared yes
terday afternoon with Attorney Os
mont, In Judge Hunt's court and upon
a showing of cruelty was granted an
interlocutory decree of divorce from his
wife, Susie Edythe Lamb. Lamb's
complaint is silent upon matters by
which the parties might be identified
and her answer making general de
nials of his allegations contain no bet
ter clew. The complaint does not even
tell where they were married except
that the knot was tied In this State on
July 4, 1898. In November, 1903, Mrs.
Lamb Is said to have gone to Boston
with her mother and to have made a
