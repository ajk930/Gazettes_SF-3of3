The executive board docs not charge
Shea with dishonesty in the "handling
of union funds. It simply alleges that
his orders brought about expenditures
that : had ' to be made because of his
having cau3ed a strike illegally. >
"I don't think they will do it." was
the reply of President Shea when asked
about the reported action of the board.
"But what If they do? .Will that settle
the strike? I might be re-elected, or I
might take up one of the several of
fers that have been made to me.";
CHICAGO, June 27. â It was reported
to-day that formal removal of Interna
tional President C. P. Shea of the
Brotherhood of Teamsters had been de
cided upon by the international execu
tive board.. The anti-Shea leaders in
the committee practically have voted
to depose the leader. A "trial" has
been held and President Shea, has been
found guilty of -violating the constitu
tion and by-laws ofthei teamsters', or
ganization. There is no appeal from
the action of the international com
mittee. It is planned promptly to an
nounce the finding, of "guilty" and to
declare the office of president vacant
until Shea's successor shall be' elected
at Philadelphia in August. â¢
For weeks the international board
has been opposed to 'Shea and his
methods. Fear that the move- to
depose the leader would make him a
"martyr" among: the rank and file and
insure his re-election as president
caused members of the board to post
pone their action.
The special charges agrainst Presi
dent Shea are that he called a strike
contrary to the constitution and made
expenditures of the brotherhood's
money contrary to the terms of the
constitution and bylaws.
M. J. Dwyer, a member of the Inter
national board, who has not' been In
Chicago since the board was sum
moned to meet here daily to help in
managing the strike, is likewise under
suspension. He was' tried by his col
leagues of the board and denied the
right to sit in the councils of the
teamsters.

Tension in official quarters has notably

on the theory that. a conference will be

to create ithe most favorable impression.'
This is a most 'fortunate turn of ' affairs,

Judtre Kronlund attacked the speech
of Baron Kennedy and said that the ut
terances v.-ere treasonable. He expressed
his eorrow that a small nation like Nor
way had so little forethought, and urged
:he selection of a Cabinet which would
act promptly and sensibly in the interest
of the whole Scandinavian peninsula/ -
Minister of Justice Berger. in the House,
defended the Cabinet and said that
Sweden did not wish to force Norway
unwillingly into a union. Such action
would mean a succession of rebellions,
which Sweden would . have . to suppress.
It would be useless, he said, to submit
the question to the Norwegian " people,
who, more than ever, were determined
to break away from the union. If Sweden
had at first laid down conditions and
Baton Kennedy said he repudiated the
idea of a conference with the rebellious
Storthing. Sweden must enforce her con
ditions and put behind the King all the
resources of the country in order to pro
tect Sweden's honorâ by war if necessary.
The Baron said that every man in Sweden
was ready to give his life to protect the
honor and glory of the country.
This remark was gTeeted with great
rheerlng by the anti-Government mem
bers. . ,
opinion he has lost two crowns instead
of one."
If Sornay did not accept, then Swe
den Bhould enforce her conditions by
war. The speaker nald be preferred
war to the sacrifice of Sweden's honor,
and If Sweden was not prepared to Â«-n
force her conditions, then Â«he deserved
the contempt of all Europe. Snedcu'n
Â«-oti(Htiouft ftbould be moderate, but
once they arc offered they mint stautl.
In conclusion, Herr Hammerskjold said
that the Cabinet and the Parliament must
"understand each other and the .Cabinets
proposal to open negotiations with Nor
way was not acceptable to the people of
Eweden.
SAYS WAR MAY HAVE TO COME.
Pastor Waldenstrom, speaking in the
House, said he was willing to remit the
bill In order to prevent hasty representa
i tiona in debate, but the union with Nor
way amounted to nothing. He said that
in Norwegian schools In recent years I
I children had been taught to bate Sweden,
'and continued:
"I am against war, but It may have to
come as a last resort. Norway's action
amounts to revolution and should be
treated accordingly as a deadly Insult to
Sweden. The Government's proposition
opens up the probability of war.' Its
weakness lies In the fact that Norway,
having broken the union, is liable to
break treaties."
Baron Kennedy, speaking in the Senate,
said:
o "If the King's message expresses his
Herr Hammarskjold said that the ac
tion of the Norwegian Storthing was
revolutionary and It had raised such a
etorm of indignation in Sweden that all
parties had rallied to the support of King
Oscar, assuring him that Sweden would
remain faithful, even though Norway had
proved false. Sweden, he said, had re
ceived a blow in the face which had
Awakened the people from their lethargy
and they demanded different action from
that taken by the Cabinet. The people
\u25a0were disappointed at the Cabinet's wav
ering proposals.
The bill, he said, was much too mod
erate, and should have strenuously cen
pured the Storthing. It was unworthy of
Sweden to commence negotiations with
revolutionists and Parliament and the
Cabinet should propose conditions which
Bweden. would accept, telling Norway
that, as she had broken away from the
union, Sweden would be willing to sepa
rate, but Norway must agree to Sweden's
conditions.
The tenor of the speeches through
out the debnte la both hoown leaven
*he I:ti(ir.s.si..ti thnt the majority of the
speakers were of the opinion that a
peaceful solution of the difficulty was
extremely improbable.
In the Senate C. A. Berg, who initiated
the debate, said:
"We must not use force to sustain the
union, which Is valueless to us under
existing conditions, but the Riksdag does
not recognize the illegal and revolu
tionary breach of the union and does not
recognize Norway as a sovereign State.
BWed^jj's rÂ«prc=Â«Â»<Â«tivÂ«>j< :Â«itrÂ£t 'consider
Ewcden's safety and this can be done
only through a Cabinet having the full

SWEDEN'S HONOR AT STAKE.
The debate on the remission of the
bill brought out fiery speeches. In
\u25a0which the action of the Norwegian
Storthing was condemned and the
Swedish Cabinet severely criticized.

BOYCOTT MOVEME.VT SPRHADIXG.
NEW YORK, June 27. â Lee Y6u
Pond, Ju&t from China, and the flrst of
his race to arrive in New York since
the executive order directing that more
courtesy be shown to Chinese was is
sued, says the boycott on American
i g>oods Is spreading. He is a partner In
Bun Wong On & Co., importers, and
went, less than four years ag-o, to his
old home in the south of China for a
vacation. He declares that in the few
months before his departure for Amer
ica the feeling against the actions of
American inspectors -was constantly
Crowing and that the Boycott League
had gained great influence. In Hong
kong, he said, lie heard much talk on
the subject and was told that the Chi
nese were everywhere In favor oÂ£ ex
cluding American goods until the
pretty between China and the United
States was strictly observed.
â¢"Considering what I had heard about
the way Chinese were treated here on
their return," continued Lee You Pond,
"I -vas agreeably surprised by the kind
ness and courtesy shown to me and to
oilier Chinese with me. I came from
Hongkong on the steamship Empress
of China, and arrived at Victoria. B.
O, oiÂ» June 20, comings by the Canadian
Pacific to Malone. N. Y. With me on
the steamship, also desiring to come to
the United States, were twenty-eight
Chinese â two women, six children and
twenty men â all of the exempt class.
I had come here originally before the
passage of the exclusion act and had
a, certificate. I had been told that for
more than an hour I would be ques
tioned, and I thought I would have to
answer these queries and would be
laughed at. It was not aa I expected.
"1 showed my certificate, -which" had
my photograph attached, and told the,
number of my store and near what
ctreet it was. I told how long I had
been away aud r answered questions
about my age and family and the name
of my interpreter. In less than ten
minutes it was over. The inspectors
vere very kind and -when" I started to
go away they smiled. Although I did
not stay long after I had answered
their queries. I met no Chinese who
was treated rudely." -
At the office of F. W. Berkshire, chief
Chinese inspector for this district, it
was said to-day that the arrival of Lee
You Pond was telegraphed from Van
couver and that the Inspectors visited
his flrm in Chinatown and learned that
his representations were true. This re
port greatly facilitated the work of the
inspectors at Malone.

pressing his ; thanks for all the proofs
of loyalty and affection he received, re
cently from ' thousands of persons
throughoutj.the : country.'
| The King dees not approve the idea and will
not consent thereto. The only condition under

tives: One, that of force and. the other
to rel uctantly accept dissolution, -; Nobody
openly advocates force, but. some persons
advocated a proceuure which would ulti

would be to, ; "compel Norway Uo â¢ retrace
its actions, but anger, must not blind us
to our dfifl -our interests
are against forcing any kind

of no "advantage, would forevo'r :' be;; a

The Premier declined to answer criti

dynastical interests were; not considered

It is a serious thing to neglect
your heart.
The moment you detect any
weakness or irregularity,; such
as short . breath after exercise,
palpitation, fluttering^, weak or
hungry spells, pain in breast,
side or shoulder, or uneasiness
when lying on left side, you
should take Dr. Miles' Heart
Cure;v it rarely ever fails to
relieve all these symptoms.
If/ not prpniptly restored*
chronic heart disease soon de-
velops, and then it only remains
for some sudden strain to com-
pletely exhaust the heart. \u25a0
Thousands of hopeless cases
have been cured, and if you do
not try; it, it Svill be the great-
est- ; mistake '-of your life.
"When ' I began taking Dr. Miles*
Remedies I was In a very, bad condl-

the great battle in the State for the
payment of taxes in arrears to the ex
tent of over $1,000,000. The compro
mise affects the 12,000 indictments al
ready found by providing that they
shall be submitted to the several courts
without evidence, thus knocking the
prosecuting attorneys out of the $10
fee in each indictment. The State
sought, by Indicting the brewers for
every sale made without wholesalers'
licenses in the past five years, to com
pensate its treasury for the loss of
license fees in that period. The com
promise does not affect the breweries

XEWBURT, N. H.. June 27.â The con
dition of Secretary of State Hay continues
favorable to-night after a comfortable
day. Dr. Fred L. Murphy of Boston re
turned this afternoon and remained at the
secretary's home to-night. Dr. Scuader
returned to Boston to-day, but will re
turn here to-morrow. The physicians de
cline to discuss the case, but Dr. Scudder
Just before his departure said Mr. Hay
had passed a comfortable day.
Tlie cold, wet weather has proved a
slight drawback, but notwithstanding the
dampness Mr. Hay's condition has im
proved noticeably since Sunday night.
Mrs. Hay felt greatly encouraged to-day
and pent a telegram to Payne Whitney,
her son-in-law, advising him and Mrs.
Whitney to fail. for Europe as they in
tended.
The announcement to-day from the sum
mer home of Secretary of State John Hay
was that the patient had passed a com
fortable night and that the morning found
him resting well, much refreshed from the
night's sleep. 1 Although Mr. Hay's sleep
was but intermittent his repose lesultefl
in the regaining of considerable strength.
It was not believed, however, that the
Secretary would be about as soon as had
been anticipated.
The arrival of a nurse and Dr. Jackson
from Boston during the night gave rise
to the belief that the secretary would
need the most careful nursing and medi
cal attention during the coming days.
The family, however, does not apprehend
any danger whatever from Mr. Hay's ill
ness, but they realize that the attack of
uraemia of Thursday, following as it did
a period of illness for which Mr. Hay
went abroad for treatment, weakened the
Secretary's physical power and necessi
tated that he remain quietly In bed for
several days.
During the night and morning a num
ber of telegraphic messages arrived from
friends inquiring as to the condition of
the patient and expressing the hope of
his Immediate return to health.
Among the telegrams received was the
following from President Roosevelt:
"White House, Washington, to Mrs.
John Hay: I cannot but be concerned
about your telegram, but am entirely con
fident that the trouble Is but evanescent.

in His Official Capacity
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.*. June 27.â Joining
with . bis former college mates to-day In
celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of
'the graduation of their class from Har
vard. President Roosevelt returned to his
alma mater not as the chief magistrate
of the nation, but as a private citizen and
a loyal Harvard alumnus. t Although the
ancient University of Harvard would
have been glad to pay him all the honor
due his high office, it was the President's
request that he be regarded merely as a
member 'of the class of '80 rather than as
the President of the United States. Nev
ertheless > students, alumni and the citi
zens of Cambridge united in giving him
a â¢ hearty greeting â¢as he drove through
the streets of the. university city.
The President's day was a busy one.
Arriving | at . Boston \early this morning,
he was driven to the Cambridge residence
of Right Rev. William Lawrence. Epis
copal Bishop of Massachusetts, where he
is being entertained. .The Bishop is presi
dent; of the Harvard 'Alumni Association.
Breakfast was served at the. Bishop's
home and among those present, in addi
tion to the President and Private Secre
tary Loeb, were the President's son. Ker-'
mlt, who came from Groton School;
President Charles W. Eliot jof Harvard
University, Judge Francis G. Lowell, and
Rev. Samuel Crothers, pastor of the First
Parish (Unitarian) Church of Cambridge.
MEETS OLD COMRADES.
During: the forenoon. President Roose
velt visited the rooms of the Alpha Delta
Phi Society, the Harvard Stadium and
the Chestnut Hill . residence of George C.
Lee; father of the President's first wife.
The President was then . driven to - the
Oakley Country Club in. "Watertown.
where the class of '80 held an informal
reunion and luncheon was served. A
photograph of the class was taken, and
also a photograph of the members of the
class who belonged to the same student
dining club as did the President. Of the
166 members of the closs of '80,. 130 have
registered at class headquarters, repre
senting nearly every State in the Union.
Returning from thÂ© Oakley. Country
Club, the President was driven to the
rooms of the Porcelain Club, an organ
ization of Harvard students," where he,
stayed about half an hour. He then re
turned to Bishop Lawrence's home, where
he put on evening clothes and was driven
to the Hotel Somerset in Boston, for the
banquet of the class of '80. . <i
l"he President made a brief address. He
was greeted with a rousing class cheer as
he rose to speak and his remarks were
frequently applauded. At his request,
no portion of his informal address was
made public. During the evening Wil
liam Hooper, In behalf of the class, pre
sented a loving cup to President Roose
velt. The cup was engraved as follows:
"To Theodore Roosevelt, President of the
United States, - from his classmates In
Harvard College. 1880-1905." ...
DRIVES IN THE RAIN.
. As on his- vlsitt to Massachusetts last
week, rain marred the President's pro
gramme. As his carriage was driven out
of Bishop ; Lawrence's yard this I forenoon
on the trip to the rooms of the Alpha
Delta Phi Society, the rain poured in tor
rents and several heavy claps of thunder
were heard. The President, however, in
sisted that the hood of the carriage be
lowered, in order that the people who had
gathered to see him might not be disap
pointed, and though the rain fell heavily,
the President rode through it apparently
not in the least disconcerted.
At frequent points along the streets
through which the Presidential . party
passed during . the day people gathered
and cheered. For all their greetings the
President had a bow and a smile, j
President Roosevelt | was accompanied
on his drive by a ,. secret service officer,
and a squad of mounted policemen. Af
ter visiting the stadium, the police escort
was dismissed temporarily and the Presi
dent's carriage was unattended â¢ from

CALL, BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. June 27. â With the
resignation of John P. Wallace, chief
engineer of the Panama* Canal Com
mission, the most critical point in the
canal situation has been reached. , Yel
low fever^s raging orf the' isthmus and
so serious is. the crisis from. this cause
and others that President Roosevelt has
called the \u25a0 International consulting
board of ; engineers to meet in ; Wash
ington on ;. September 1. This board
wields great influence and will prac
tically determine, the still open ques
tion, whether the waterway shall be a
sea-level or a lock: canal. Wallace's
threat to resign at Ithls vital Juncture
unless he were at once endowed with
powers far in, excess of what were con
sidered .necessary was declared to be
an unreasonable exaction, which neither
the. President; nor Secretary Taft was
willing to endure.
In view o^ the. alarming: situation
that has arisen, the suggestion is now
heard on all "sides that the best way
out of the difficulty is to place the con
struction of ,the canal in charge of the
Engineer Corps' of the army. The ex
cellent record of 'this corps; which has
perfected all great public works in this
country, is held. up as an argument of
great" force â¢ in, lavor of this -course.
There is" no. indication, however, that
such a step will be taken by the Presi
dent â¢ \u25a0;\u25a0\u25a0- : \u25a0\u25a0' '\u25a0 \u25a0 " \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 '<:.:.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0â¢ '\u25a0 .
Wallace's retirement ends what has
been as warm a row as has occurred in
governmental circles 'in a -long time.
Wallace to-day telegraphed to the com
mission to forward his mail to the
Panama Railway offices in New York.
One official, who is In close touch
with the officers of the commission,
says the; entire trouble was brought
about by. Wallace desiring to be the
"whole 'thing" in the work of canal
construction. When Wallace and Sec
retary Taft met in New York, Wallace
is understood to have requested an ex
tension of powers which would have
been in reality the 'establishment of a
"one-man commission," 'with Wallace
as; the one man.; -With' a $60,000 post
awaiting his acceptance -in \u25a0 New- York;
Wallace is said to have felt that he was
in a position to seek : not ' only greater
powers in canal work, but also more
pay. than the $25,000! he gets as . chief
engineer.- lit. was this demand, It is
here believed, which aroused Secretary
Taft to anger and led him to declare
he could receive Wallace's resignation
none too quickly and that he .was em
powered by the President to say so.

in California, Benjamin H. Huntington,'
formerly president of the' Dime Savings
Bank of Brooklyn, ,to r day filed in the
United States District Court a volun

whereabouts. of Huntington is unknown
to his family here; neither is it known
whether his young wife, to whom he
was married in the West a few months
ago. is with him. The details of how he
lost his big fortune are not known to
his family. ; ; ;
Huntlngton was for twenty-five years
closely ; identified with the Dime Sav-.
ings Bank, and was for several years
its president. When a year ago he re
tired from the presidency he was re
puted to' be wealthy. Soon after he an
nounced his intention of going West to
prospect for gold mines. :MÂ»tV many
months after he went\ West Huntlngton
wrote to his sister that he had married
a young woman and that he was happy
and prosperous, is 60 years old." A

NEW YORK, June 28.â The World this
morning says that a highly delicate situ
ation'has arisen in the affairs of the Pa
nama Canal Commissionâ one which may
lead to more trouble than the Roosevelt
administration has yet experienced In any
other public matter. , Officials" ln Wash
ington' are | desperately 'endeavoring to
avoid a scandal which would quite put
into the shade anything of the kind heard
of since American control was begun on
the isthmus and might even run Jn close
competition. with some of the odorous af
fairs of the days when the French were
trying to dig the canal.' ' \
John T. Wallace, chief engineer of the
commission, has ' placed only a tentative
resignation in the hands of the President,
according to the EWorld. If j this is ac
cepted Wallace will at once become an
important factor., in the street . railroad
situation in this city* by being placed at
the head of ; "the Ryan subway syndicate,
the" rival of the Belmont combine. - How
ever,' !f certain requests, almost in the
nature of demands,' made by. the chief en
gineer, upon the administration are com-"
plied with he will remain at his post and
the public will hear jj nothing j further of
impending revelations. But those in close
touch with affairs; ln Washington are, of
the opinion that Wallace will be allowed
to go, even at the risk of uncovering con
ditions ' In -'the; canal' zone' which every
official', from '."\u25a0 the President down" is
anxious : to; conceal. . , . ;'.; '.- ;

The King of Siam, although an abso
lute ruler, responsible only to himself,
has within the last few years, of his own
initiative, abolished slavery. He is now
trying to stamp out gambling and Min
ister King says tnat by ISO 6 there will.be
no such. thing in Siam. 'His Majesty, of
Siam is letting the gamblers down easily.
He started in last year and declared
gambling illegal In one- third of his king~
doxn. This year he placed the royal ban
on games of chance in tke second third
and next year the remaining fraction will
come- under the anti-gambling law. And
laws in Siam, according to Mr. King, are
observed ia spirit and to the letter.:
There is much cholera in Bangkok at
certain seasons. .-Smallpox also* is-. pre
valent iin the land. Three â¢months ago
the Government established at -Bangkok
a well equipped bacteriological laboratory
ana shortly before Mr. King' left 75,000
people had been vaccinated. The 'cholera
problem *is also receiving attention.
Bangkok's water supply is not very good,
but within a few months this will be
remedied. Artesian water, free from all
impurity, has been found in unlimited
quantity and before long the people of
Bangkok will be able to slake their thirst
without necessity of swallowing 'cholera
and other microbes. ' â¢'Â» â¢\u25a0\u2666

seven years. 11l health has brought him
home for a vacation and during - his ab

Slam's foreign trade lost year, says
Minister King, amounted to nearly $50,

moncpoly, but Germany', by more pro
gressive methods, ia . rapidly displacing;

Special Dispatch { to . The Call.
Judge Bennett and Senator Thurston
will present the arguments for the de
fenss to-morrow and it is expected that
the case will go to the jury early in the
afternoon.
Throughout the argument the speaker
made no attacks upon Senator Mitchell,
but followed the evidence as it had been
presented. He made no effort at declama
tion, but his remarks were forceful and
clear and brought up in vivid array the
evidence gathered by the Government
and upon which the prosecution bases its
-hopes of conviction.
District Attorney Heney maintained
that the indirect receipt of money was
all that was contemplated by the statute.
\u25a0 Attorney A. S. Bennett wanted Judge
de Haven to instruct the jury that in case
it was shewn that Mitchell received
money without knowing it was unlawfully
acquired, a later knowledge of this by
the defendant could not lay him open to
the charge of crime.
Attorney Heney presented the case of
the prosecution to the jury in an argu
ment extending over two hours. He said
it vas the duty of the jury to decide the
case on its merits and upon the evidence,
irrespective of the age or position in life
of the defendant, disregarding the tears
of grown men and the sophistry of
speeches maue and to be made by the
attorneys for the defense.
Only one witness was examined by the
defense, he being J. A. Martin of Port
land, who testified that he had asked the
Senator to secure the establishment of
the narbor lines several years ago, in
order that a whaif might be constructed.
The Senator did as requested and refused
all compensation for his efforts. All of
the evifle&CCi introuueed by Senator Mit
chcirs attorneys has been in this line,
and though it was held to be immaterial
by the court, it was allowed by the
prosecution until this morning, when At
torney Heney began to grow restive, as
did the court, and the defense Quit aryl
rested its case.
â¢ Senator Thurston addressed the court
in argument as to the Instructions to be
fiivtn the jury when the case was sent
to them. He contended that the Indict
ment .alleged that money had been paid
to the Senator by Fred A. Kribs and
argued that the proof showed that checks
had been given Tanner, who in turn sent
checks to Mitchell, thus preventing any
knowledge on the part of the defendant
as to tlie source of his dividends paid
him by the firm.
PORTLAND. June 27.-United' States
Senator Mitchell will not Dear testimony

to a close. The courtroom was crowded
to-day when the session opened^ many
-being drawn by the story that to-day the
aged Senator would take the stand, and,
by . his own words, attempt to dis-prove
TJÂ«e testimony of his former partner.
Judge A. H. Tanner, and of his former
private secretary, Harry C. Robertson.
JJut all these were disappointed and sur-
" prised, for the case for the defence rested

NEWSBOYS HOLD
A BIG MEETING
\u25a0 General Wood will -. not be in the
Orient to receive the Taft party, but
says that all preparations have been
made to take, good care of the distin
guished visitors. The general has
passed two years In the Philippines and
hla appearance proves that for some
constitutions the climate is all right.
If President Roosevelt and the general
meet at Oyster Bay and the two. old
friends, for the sake of old times, arm
with foils or don boxing gloves for a
spell of physical culture, the comman
der-ln-chief of the army will have to
hustle if he gains the decision over the
thick set major general.
Among the. Manchuria's steerage
passengers was John A. Mulr, a Brit
isher, who claims to have been attached
to the Japanese secret service. ,He
enabled the Japanese to capture many
blockade runners,. he says, and it was
on his advice that Togo waited where
he did for the Russian fleet.: He is
going, he, says, to Richmond, Va., to
work on a newspaper,,- the editor, of
which saw some of Mulr's writing in a
Hongkong paper and showed his appre
ciation of the Muir style by. offering
Muir a Job on the, Richmond _ Dispatch.
Most of the trouble in Mindanao,
says General Wood, was caused by a
band of Borneo pirates, subjects, of
Great Britain, who were driven by
Kins Edward's armed men into Amer
ican territory. These pirates estab
lished themselves in the domain over
which General- Wood has Jurisdiction.
They had a bad Influence on the na
tives, among whom they inspired sev
eral uprisings. General Wood' sent sev
eral expeditions to exterminate these
lawless visitors. Those of the pirates
who are not dead , are prisoners await
ing extradition to British jurisdiction
and for the time being there is peace
in Mindanao.
Major General Leonard Wood = ar
rived-, hero- yÂ«stÂ«rda>" from .the Phil
ippines. He was one of a number of
distinguished passengers on the' liner
Manchuria. Accompanied: by Mrs.
Wood and his aid, Captain H. Dorey.
he is home unofficially to attend to
some personal affairs at Boston.; He
expects to be in America not more than
thirty days.; He will not go to Wash
ington,' but may visit Oyster Bay and
there spend a few. days with his friend
and sponsor. President Roosevelt.
General Wood" has little to say of the
Philippines. His headctuarters at Zam
boango.he says, are rather out of the
way. His turbulent wards, the Moros,
are not so unruly, as \u25a0 the general im
pression '.. would Indicate and with the
commercial situation he disclaims j* all
acquaintance except in 'a very general
way.
The club will meet again on Friday
night. July 7, the place of meeting to
' . be* determined later.
\u2666 There are indications that Ruef will
not be able to hold the reins of authority
in the I'r.ion Labor party without a
â¢ Elrugsre at the primary election August
*8. There are signs of revolt in the labor
tii.-tricts south of Market street. In one
jiistiict the nomination for Supervisor has
been promised by the Ruef-Schmitz com
bination to six separate aspirants for the
, pojgittoa9Â»B(tef is figuring on harmonious
* if< eeptancfc of his programme for the
rejection of delegates to the Union Labor
. ti.nvention. He expects to vote a few
ittcn in each prechict'for'theiabor ticket
and throw the rest of the party's strength
to* the . horse and-rart end of the Demo
cratic party. In the Thirty-ninth District
it is proposed that the labor vote shall
* be used by Ruef to send a Maestrettl dele
gation to the Republican nominating con
vention.
The San Francisco Republican League
cf the Forty-second District was or
ranlzed last night In Saratoga Hall,
Geary Btreet.
E. N. Avers was elected president. Dr.
Henry Gibbons Jr. vice president, and
John A. McGee secretary. The chair
man said that the object of the league is
to secure for San Francisco a clean and
honest civic administration under Repub
lican auspices. The sentiment through
, out the entire district is Etrongly in favor
. of the movement and the league expects
â¢ to elect its delegates by a large majority.
No opposition to the league's ticket is
expected in the district.
Prominent men .in all walks of life
have. allied themselves with the organi
zation and have pledged the heartiest co
operation to bring about a change in
the city's administration. The committee

tion of the San Francisco Republican

Gte. George A. McGowan, J. G. Tyrrell

The organizition of Assembly District
Clubs under the general plan adopted by
the San Francisco Republican .League
is progressing in a manner that signifies
determination upon the part of citizens
to wrest the control of municipal affairs
from Ruef and Schmltz.
The Forty-first District Club was or
ganized last night under the auspices of
the San Francisco Republican League at
the home of A. X, Dag-gett. The evening
\u25a0was taken cp with the election of of
ficers. Colonel J. C. Currier was elected

cinct committee men.
; On that day in 1883 James "'Mooney,
accompanied by his wife and two chil
dren, one of them; Annie,' a bright little
one four and a half years of ag^e, went
to the picnic* at Belmont given .by the
Carpenters' -Union. While the mother,
with^ a babe in " her arms, was seated
at" a table talking to* some fellow-ex
cursionists,, she : noticed 'that 'there !,was
trouble at the place where ' races were
being run. Seeing her; husband going
in that; direction, she went toward him
to ask him to not go in the crowd, and
as she left she permitted little Annie to
remain with a child ; of her* own age,
Ida. May." . "When! the -mother returned
she found the' May girl where she had
left her, but Annie was not ; there, v A
search was made for her without â¢ suc
cess./ , The May! child could not tell
where Annie had gone; nor; had any of
the people in the vicinity seen her leave
the grounds. -
Half an hour after, the. disappearance
of little Annie the 'alarm was given
and 200 or more of ,- the picnickers,
scoured the. country if or miles around
until dark, but none brought glad tid
ings to the distracted, parents./ ; The
search was then abandoned. : but re
sumed at daylight the following morn-
Ing by the officers ;of the -county and
the father. -The search was kept up tor
days, but there were no tidings of tho
missing Annie. The father spent many
weeks in searching the country, around
with Sheriff Hatch and Constable Grlm
menstein,' but there was no trace of the
child. "\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0- ââ¢ \ -v"--.^-: ;1 \u25a0\u25a0;\u25a0:-.. '\u25a0 ..-
The Call sent a reporter, to ;the. place
from which the littld; one disappeared,
and he -was the -first., one. to /discover
that she -had r passed out of. the grounds i
through : a' hole |in | thet riortttern uf enco;
and when last seen fwas" toddling down
the county road leading -to La Honda./
The belief, was strong^ at "thepiime
that the child disappeared' that she was
picked up by a :band of -gypsies that
were camped i near Belmont ' and vrho
moved "three days i after the ' picnic.
The death of "James Moohey calls to
mind the sad story of -a man who ' has
borne a"burden-such as '^forced upon
few of God's creatures. ;: Many will re
member J the disappearance ! of = his | little
daughter Annie ', from the ' Belmont 5 pic
nic grounds on July 15, 1883. ": It is
one, of : the, most remarkable cases on
record, even more , puzzling/ than ' that
of the famous. Charley Ross, for there
it was ; known ''how the 'boy. was stolen
from his parents, .but what became ! of
little Annie Mooney Is a mystery^ which
has never: been solved. The ; father
never aulte . recovered \u25a0 from -the | blow,'
and the memory 1 of the child -was fresh
in his mind until the? moment' of hLs
death.:. Everything, that" the _ wee tot
had owned was treasured up and; care^
fully kept, only to |be | brought out at
times to be tnourned over by the grief-,
stricken "parents.
Saddened by 'the sudden loss of his
baby daughter." twenty-two ; years! ago;
whose fate' he never knew, James Moo
ne"y,":arf aged resident of San Francisco,
died! at his home at 3821 Twenty-fifth

BOOZEf OR MEDICINE?
Â« Which will you have? li a woman raf-
tering from cms of tho delicate ailments

you to know that Dr. Pieroe'i Favorlto
Prescription Is the only remedy adver-
tised for such maladies which is abso-
Jutelr free from intoxicating liquors and
all other harmful agents. The good you
feel from It* use is not the delusive ex-
hilaration from a tippling beverage, from
which the system reacts into a worse
condition than before. It may be a little
slower In manifesting Its bracing and
invigorating action, but its benefits are
none the less positive aad, best of all,
they are lasting. It's an honest medi-
cineânot a beverage.
â¢ "I have been taklnr yxraz medicine for the

East Madison Street, Mount Pleuant, lowa.
" I have been having very poor health all win-
ter. I doctored with our family doctor but
waa relieved only while taklnr the medicine.
I took Dr. Pierces medicine several years
aro. I knew It was good for any one suffer-
ing with female trouble. Have taken only
one bottle and am gaining strength very
fast- I could not eat nor sleep when I began
â¢taking the 'Favorite Prescription.* Heart
troubled me and I had cold and numb spells
till ray heart would almost stop beating.
Have nad one child since first taking your
medicine. If I con tin no with your treatment
am positive I will be cured."
Every- suffering woman in this land
should write to Dr. Pierce and learn how
certainly he can help her to health and
-strength. It costs nothing to write and

Postmaster George W. Schmidt said to
day that Mr. Schnelle's "estate consisted
of acreage In West Berkeley, and ot"
money In the First National Bank of
Berkeley, and the German Savings Bank
of San Francisco. Schnelle * cam* to
America on the same ship i that carried
the parents jof j Mr. . Schmidt, . and the
postmaster was intimately acquainted
with his affairs. , He says that Schnelle
had genuine . affection for the Brennings,
and for Freda in particular, but he never
heard of Bchnelle's intention to disin
herit his stepdaughters ;or sister in the
girl's favor. ' \ ' ; ."., ;
A contest fof this estate Is expected to
be instituted by- hia.*two step-daughters.
Mrs. Fred Offe and Mrs. Lena Socke,
daughters of his first wife. Schnelle
was married three times, but survived
all his wiv;s. He has a sister living in
Cincinnati, who is believed . ? ; to be his
nearest relative. It is thought that his
affection for John Hrennlng'.s family may
have led to the making of a will by which
they benefit more than through the deed
which was filed to-day! .Â»
Miss Brenning was a favorite of the
agred German. In the deed to the land
which he save her is a stipulation that
tho document was not to bs tiled until
after his death. It is not known, as yet,
whether Schnelle left a will, disposing
of his large realty holdings, or of the
money he is known to have had In the
banks.'
BERKELEY, June 27.-Freda Brenning,
a fifteen-year-old' girl of -West Berkeley,
is the only person to come forward thus
far with legal claim to any of the^estate
left by Charles Schnello, the aged capi
talist who, committed 'suicide last night
at his residence on California. street. A
deed to a lot on California street, close
to Schnelle's home, was filed by Miss
Bronnlng to-day in Oakland. The value
of tlte property is not estimated. The
consideration Is said to have been "love
and affection."

Dr. Boltzmann held an inCoTjTMI lÂ«vcÂ«
in his apartments at Cloyne court in
the morning, and the greeting's W'.'re
continued when he arrived on the cam
pus. His appearance, to most people,
suggests the foreign savant,' and 1 the
hundreds of summer school attendants
had little difficulty in discovering his
identity. The mane of iron grray,
bushy hair, the great massive head,
crowned with a haf of evident Euro
pean origin, the keen, searching eyes
with which the savant looked through
steel-rimmed glasses at the new. world
he had entered â these and other char
acteristics suggested to observers the
presence of . the I eminent physicist
whose coming: had bean widely her
alded.
Dr. Boltzmann's work is to bo for
the benefit of advanced students in
physics. Thermo dynamics will be his
principal subject. He is esteemed to be
the greatest living authority in his
field. He took his degree at the Uni
versity of Vienna in 1567 and has since
been occupied continuously in Euro
pean universities in the work of in
struction and experimentation. He has
held Important chairs at the Univer
sities of Vienna, Gratz, Munich. Leip
zig, and is now back at his alma mater,
the University of Vienna, where his
rank Is that of professor of physics.
He compared the climate of Califor
nia with that of Vienna, saying that
It rivaled the delightful weather he
declares prevails almost continuously
at the Austrian capital. For the
weather of the East Dr. Boltzmann has
nothing- to cay. He merely uplifts his
hands. He has not been in California
before. His lectures at the summer
school will be delivered in English.
BERKELEY. June 27.â The leonine
head and striking figure" of Dr. Un&yrtg
Boltzmann appeared on ihe universit,"

and greet the eminent physicist from
Europe. Dr. Boltzmann left t:ie . Uni

"The Strohl-McAlliÃter affair seems to
be a Napa County political feud of long
standing. I notice that many of the inci
dents referred to in the newspaper gossip
| date back seven or eight years. The mer
chants of Napa County have always been
fairly treated by the management of the
home and in no instance has a Napa
County dealer failed to receive award of
contract when he was the lowest bidder."
Other members of the board assert that
the Strohl-McAllister fight is simply the
revival of an old struggle of Napa fac
. tions for political mastery, and has noth
* ing whatever to do with the management
of the home. On the advice of the na
tional inspectors the board of directors
has adopted the policy of permitting
gruests to be entertained at the officers'
cottage. Every well regulated home, en
tertains guests. Five years ago the board
adopted a resolution that every officer and
director should be permitted to entertain
guests at the officers' cottage on payment
to the treasury of the cost of subsistence.
Governor Gage and Governor Pardee held
that as the directors received no com
pensation for their services they should
not be obliged to pay, but the board for
Its own protection maintained the cule.
Jt Is well enough for guests to be kept
away from asylums, prisons and pest
houses, but the Veterans' Home is an
institution of a diffeient character. Sev
eral of the States have made appropri
ations to enable the old veterans to bring
theJr wives into camp as permanent resi
dents. The visits of ladies and children
are encouraged in every well regulated
tsoldicrs' home. Books, music and agree
able guests brighten a home and ; render
life cheerful.
Colonel Richards. U. S. A., inspector of
homes, national and State, visited the
home in Yountville in May. During his
three <lays' sojourn he went through ev
ery nook and corner of every department
ahd listen .d to every member who asked
to *peak to him. He frankly asserted
that the heme was net surpassed and
hardly equaled in the United States,
and that his report to the National Board
of Managers would give the State of
California credit for caring for her dls
â¢ a bled soldiers in a generous and com
mendable manner. He found the per
centage of happy all d contented members
exceptionally large."
Without reporting to harsh and ex
treme measures the board of directors is
doing all that can be done tot Prevent
weak members of the institution" from
squandering their money and disgracing
themselves in exhibitions of drunkenness
in the saloons cf Yountville.
There is no agitation in the board for
legislative measures in Congress to re
store thÂ£ canteen. Duncan E. McKin
lay the Representative of the district,
may introduce such a measure at the
request of the veterans themselves.
General Samuel W. Backus was asked
yesterday concerning the death rate since
the canteen was abolished. He said: "The
death rate has tncreased since the canteen
was closed, the number of deaths in the
% month of May being exceptionally large.
The board has not that control over the
liquor drinking propensity of weak mem
bers that It had when tne canteen existed.
The medical department reports that the
liquor sold In come of the saloons of
Yountville is vile and poisonous. What
we are now compelled to guard against is
that the men who go to the dives and get
drunk shall not be permitted to disturb
the rest and sleep of their sober com
5 rades."
HOME I3T GOOD COXDITIOX.
Concerning general conditions at the
borne. General Backus said: "The home
Is in excellent order. The, men, or the
great majority of them,, are happy and
contented.
Dr. Russell, department commander of
the Grand Army of the Republic, accom
panied by his staff, visited the home two
weeks ago. On his return to Marysville
he was interviewed by the Appeal. He
spoke in the highest terms of the man
agement of the institution. He remarked
that the supplies furnished were the best
in the market, and the men were a happy
and contented lot.

Messrs. Redding and Bromley, leading

than welcome visitors among the old

stirring sentiments is In store from tluse
famous speakers. Mr. Redding is an ora
tor of far more than ordinary ability
and before an assemblage of the veter

tion for highest effort. The directors are
xnuch pleased because of Mr. Redding's
acceptance of the invitation to speak.
Mrs. Snyder Johnson, a 'singer of rare
accomplishment, will sing "The Star-

Fireworks to delight the old and' young

Joseph D. Redding has accepted the In
vitation to address the veterans and their
guests on the Fourth. Uncle George T.
Bromley, who has visited the camp : on
Beveral memorable occasions, â¢ will go
this time with Mr. Redding as the special
envoy of the owl. In the archives of the
Veterans' Home there is a big mark to
the credit of the Bohemian Club. The
net proceeds of Paul Neumann's lecture
on "Debt" at Plan's Hall many . years
ago were given by the club to the fund
for the establishment of the home. The
cum of JIMS was thus contributed. It

stead, valued at $40,000. and an allow
ance of $500 per month, $12,000; from.' the
valuable estate left by Franklin Heywood
ac his death on July 28, ISOs. : The widow
was also denied \u25a0 the right of taking the
furniture and pictures that were in the
residence, and this decision firmly .: es
tablishes fie, daughter's right to this
property under the will: Â»
Timothy J.: Lyons, her attorney, said:
As to the widow the decision necessarily,
meant . that she was not a member of , her
husband's' "family" at- the time of his death;
that the articles of separation made between
her and Heywood v thirteen years before I) hU
death had cut her off from all rights of Â©very
kind as "widow"< or "heir," and that the claim
of the widow, that there,- had been ; a ."recon
ciliation" between her and her husband Just
before his death and that this revoked the
articles of separation was ' not well
in fact or In law. . \u25a0\u25a0 "- \u25a0 .'\u25a0â¢ - :
As to the denial of the daughter's applica
tion 7 for the homestead and a. family allow
ance, the Judge's decision was on purely tech
nical grounds, although: involving a palpable
Injustice, to. the daughter, as all : the opposing
attorneys In the case were, forced to admit
on the trial and In the ' arguments. The
daughter, .Agnes .Maud Heywood,, at< the time
of her father's death, was but seventeen years
old, and was his sole "family": and confessed
ly entitled to the rights of homestead and
family allowance. But she did not know until
after she .became, eighteen years old that the
law gave " her these j rights or ( that - the court
had not made a decree . securing them to' her.
Because she did not apply to the court while
she was under age, the \u25a0 widow and : the collat
eral relatives objected that she -had lost these
important rights. : . .'..'\u25a0 ...â¢'. -
By Judge Kerrigan's , ruling it seems that
the probate law is such as to bring about;, this
absurd and unjust result as to: those under
age and unable to help themselves. In * this
particular case the result of the Judge's ruling
as to the law is carried to the utmost limit
of misfortune, for the daughter attempted on
the trial to prove. that the alleged loss of her
daughter rights was chargeable to the > willful
conduct of the executors of Heywood's will,
also named as. her guardians, and to the act
of the attorney for the executors, the same
attorney that represented Heywood la his life
time for many years.- ...
The daughter's attorney Is not worried
over the decision yesterday- against his
client, in view of -the fact that the court
has ruled the widow out. Furthermore,
the daughter has perfected an appeal
from a previous decision by Judge Kerri
gan, which will be heard by the Supreme
Court in August. * That appeal involves
the validity of the, "trust", attempted: to
be created by Heywood's. will, and if the
daughter's legal contentions are sustained
she will get the entire estate of $220,000,"
and, if not sustained, she will at least bo
entitled to one-*ialf of the estate and
nearly all of the income of the other half.

many' of us," doubted the -sufficiency of

fidious because 'so many of them bad

and also because every one instinctive
ly believes, although he may not ; ad
mit the belief, that a man whose busi
ness in life is to deal in patronage and
make money f f<yn : the dealing- , is not
a man to be trusted. %
A German critic of : American life has
declared that flirtation has become in the
hands of the American woman a- fine
art. From her youth up" she flirts, and
thus she ..becomes, perforce,' the incom
parable mistress { of this social % pastime.
Her coquetry in ' no degree touches : her
heart; It is absolutely {&': social /accom
plishment. â¢ She looks , upon it as a diver
sion, like golt or Uennis, : or j dancing or
skating. If she plays to win it is purely
in the spirit of sport.
This Is, of course, neither, a: justiflca
tlon nor .a defense of flirtation; it Is. an
unprejudiced statement of a general fact.
Though it explains fairly- well the genesis
of :, the r married 'â¢ flirt,', it ! does | not touch
upon the question ;;of her good taste* or
good sense ( ln taking so lightly the so-
My opinion of her frivolity is influenced
largely by the environment in which 1
behold her playing at her gay pastime of
shuttlecock and battledore with the se
rious things of life.
Although she makes a figure which Is
not wholly : unattractive when seen
against the background of the social con
ditions from which her - individuality
sprung, she is hopelessly ;. vulgar.'. in an
other milieu, where her surroundings do
not explain her. / ; , , \u25a0 \u25a0
It is the married flirt of my own land
who attracts me most of all her kind.
She is less designing than^ the English
type, and considerably more alluring; and
she belongs in an entirely different cate
gory . from the French woman who does
not find her husband's | devotion enough
of incense before the altar of her self
esteem. \u25a0 : ", - \u25a0 .. \u25a0 '\u25a0;.\u25a0-/.
:. London, June 1.
I HAVE been asked to give my opinion
of the married flirt; is she harmless,
is she baneful? Should she be toler
ated, or should she be cast down from
her pretty pedestal of popularity and co
quetry by Mme.'.Grundy's adverse de
cree?
The tendency of flirtation* Is to under
mine the : strength of one's affections,
and to bring about"* subtly but surely a.
deterioration of character. We may grow
to the height of our -own ideals, -maybe;
by : continuous : effort, ; but we j can never
grow above them.
The temple iof love is a holy, place only
to thfise who enter it in a spirit of wor

to understand .why, any man should go
to the trouble of flirting with a married
woman, whatever her attractions. What
zest can there be in a game ;in which
excellence of performance is no particu

of such trifling ought to be enough to
nip romance in the bud as surely as
would a chilling breath of ennui. â¢

c to look for an invasion through Belgium. That means that he will
Â°; take charge of Belgium if his interests make it necessary. If the
'- suspected programme be carried out, it would' mean that the Danish
and Dutch West Indies would become German' and the Kaiser
would be in a position to dispute our hegemony of this hemisphere,
for of course Dutch Guiana would fall to him, giving his empire a
" continental foothold in South America. \TyJ:

r"r "p I HE press of continental Europe is just now discussing the re
j lations of the Kaiser to his uncle, the King of England. : In
â¢ "* : those relations there is supposed to be the probability of war,
â. primarily between Germany and France.,
â¢*\u25a0 It is entirely natural that the Kaiser should follow the habit of
the â¢ Hohenzollerri family. They have been land getters from their
Starr in the Black Forest. The electorate has expanded into an em
pire. I But the possibilities of expansion did not end with the seizure
c of Alsace and Lorraine.- Denmark, Belgium and Holland remain to
KAISER AND KING.
The situation is alarming to all citizens who. choose to ; give it
thought. The remedy is not in abridgment of the jury system, but
in increasing the power of the judges, in enlarging their function in
trie trial of criminal cases. It is notorious that citizens qualified by
training and capacity and judgment for jury service persistently
avoid that duty. They have the logical quality of mind to judge and
sift testimony and apply law to the facts proved. But their evasion
of duty tends to put on juries quite another class, as unfit as the
evaders are fit, for that responsibility. "A nation finally stands or
falls according as its laws are faithfully enforced or carelessly ad
ministered. The jury is part of our institutions. ;It must- so re
main, but if law is to survive the jury must be reformed. Men fit
for that service must be called to it, and juries must receive more
assistance from the judges. The judge knows when aiact has been
proved or not. He knows how proof or disproof legally affects the
case. Yet he is now compelled to sit powerless while the jury is
affected and its verdict controlled by proof that is insufficient, and
by wholly extraneous matter introduced into the final argument of
counsel. â¢ . _ .
'There is little complaint of the disposition of civil cases when
left to the judge. Equity decisions by the court alone are accepted
cs righteously decided. Where the judge alone is responsible for a
decision affecting the great rights of man there is instant acquies
cence. The weak point in our administration of law is the jury
trial. â¢ The fault is statutory. The law can give the judge a larger
share in jury trials than is now permitted. He can be authorized to
give the jury his opinion of the facts as well as of the law. Nov/
lie acts subjunctively. "X the jury think such or such a fact is
proved," then the law is applied to it so and so. How many jurors
understand this when they hear i,t from the bench? Inevitably' they
-question why the law so applies, and not being lawyers, and being
unable to see and understand for themselves the application of law
to fact, 'they are led off into a purely sentimental verdict by the ora
torical flights of counsel. .
The American bar has a duty in the premises. Secretary Taft
has indicated the remedy to be a larger relation between the court
apd'the jury: Every State Legislature has a large contingent of
lawyers in its membership. Let every lawyer consider it his duty
tO press upon the Legislature the need of this reform.
SECRETARY TAFT, who has served on the- Federal bench,
' aiwj Stands in the front rank of American lawyers, in his Yale
' address criticized the administration of American criminal
law.. He did not hesitate to put the blame where it belongs. The
Call has pointed out that the wide popular prejudice against judges,
who' are- held responsible for the miscarriage of justice in criminal
cases, is' misplaced. Tl>c- fault is with the juries and not the judges.
Ij : Secretary Taff traces the Fault back from the juries to the ten
dency of pur law to ensmall the office of the judge in the trial of
criminal -cases. The judge may deal with the law only, while the
facts arc left entirely to digestion by the jury. /So we have re
markable verdicts. In two cases recently, vyhere aged men were put
on trial for murder, juries reduced the crime to murder in the second
degree in one. case, and to manslaughter in the other. Yet in both
cases the facts in evidence showed the crime to be clearly murder in
the first degree; with the penalty cither death or life imprisonment.
/ : These verdicts were obtained by counsel using the age of the
defendants in mitigation of their crime. Now the law, strictly ad
ministered, does not permit age to work mitigation of penalty. ,A
vicious and lawless disposition of mind, recklessly cherished into
old age and -finally leading to murder, is what the law intends to
.restrain by punishment. Age has Hothing to do with it. Young
ni'en, under the same circumstances, facts and evidence, would have
beeir hanged by the jury. When a murderous disposition maintained
in "old 'age, and finally leading to the overt act, is not sufficiently
punished, the effect is to encourage the young to give their evil
passions full sway.
\- V The. purpose of the law is to protect society by punishment of
the. guilty^ and at the same time to admonish others of the sure
punishment that awaits the pursuit of^an evil course of life. In the
!afst twenty years there have been 131,951 murders and homicides in
the. United States, and only 2286 legal executions. The murders
and homicides have averaged 6597 per year, the executions only 114!
The Responsibility is with the juries. The juries are drawn from the
body of tbe people. The mobs that try to remedy the mistakes of
ihe.juries are supplied by the same people. Judges are powerless
under Our present system. Considering the large number of mur
ders and homicides,' it is conceivable that on juries there may ap
pear a percentage of men connected by some tie of kin or friendship
with others who have been guilty of murder. By a perfectly natural
psychology such jurors are in a sympathetic attitude of mind toward
a=man who is on trial for murder. When the same psychology is
carried into the trial of criminals guilty of crimes against property,
the evil is widened and the safeguards of life and property are
broken down.

"A few years his junior." I
IT was in a boarding-house that 1
came upon , Mr. and Mrs. Hiram
Greene " and I valued the friendship I
established with them . so highly that,
though it is fully twenty, years since I
first met them. I have : taken pains to
keep the friendship, up^in spite of wan
derings many "and far in the meantime^
Hiram was an expert . accountant â
not very- expert, but expert enough* to
be able to command then and now a de
cent salary and permanent work. He
was not what anybody would call a
man of striking appearance, being
rather undersized, with sparse sandy
hair and side whiskers, art"" upper lip
shaved clean, pale blue eyes and given
to wearing clothing that passed with
out comment of any sort in any assem
blage. \u25a0/.: . :
He had lived to be 40 before he took
him a wife, having seemingly^ waited
until an endowment policy he had kept
up> from early youth; matured and put
him in the possession of a * sum of
money which, carefully invested, se
cured his further years from penury
and want. This attained he went to
the little town In central New York
State which had seen his birth ; and
schooling, and. there wooed and won a
friend of his earlier years, Mary Moul
ton. She was a few years : his Junior,
and, like himself, had remained unmar
ried, living upon a small but sufficient
heritage. . .
As Mary had fairly outlived the ex-
pectation of matrimony, she was grate
ful to -the points of tenderness; for S the
affection \vhich; the sood Hiram was
able r to bestow .upon her. As sire (had
lived for years by herself in a little
cottage in one" of the smallest of towns,
the. change to a -boarding-house"; of the
quietest and most respectable sort In \u25a0 a
great - city > was \u25a0 something â¢ ' she :Â» never
ceased to congratulate herself upon.
I met them Just 'after they Were mar
ried. There ; was none., of d that 'â¢. wild
sentimentally on exhibition which is
to be seen when more you thf u 1 couples
bind themselves 'for life: and have not
yet settled 'down to the assurance that
life is made : up of bread and cheese
quite as much as' of .kisses. \u25a0:\u25a0 -They, were
never -surprised by the: other; boarders
in. -attitudes of devotion, nor were \u25a0 they
seen ;to ; hold Xhands in the* twilight.
But there iwas ;a, very!; honest -look? in
their eyes when they met, and, though
Mrs." ; Greene could never by any. chance
have been called a beauty,; even in her
early days, ; the smile that \u25a0; she directed
toward . Hiram from time to time was
good to look at.- ' '.' *
Mrs. Greene told my wife how kind and
thoughtful I her husband had'been to. her
from the he went back to the old
places untiUthat moment.' Whatever her
earlier ideals .of a spouse may have been
It was evident \ that . Hiram .filled to the
brim -the cup -of her later imagininngs.
Arid in, similar; fashion Hiram told me
how considerate: she j was,, how willing
shejiad been to part. with. the little prop
erty she: had back in York State and in
vest it in Chicago, where she could keep
i her eye on it. how they had agreed; be
j tween them that it would be-HTiecessary
| for them to sacrifice some of the settled
| habits - they i had - acquired '-\u25a0 during a long
| life 'i alone in order . to | secure their I mar
j rled | happiness, and | how ; this had "come
to be\ a - point of honor :, with ; them both,
each seeking to give up some little former
practice*' for the other, each trying at j all
j times to secure the other In Independence
iof feeling and actionV : : j -
Mrs. Greene had never been. to the the
ater before her marriage and Mr. preene
had ' been savingT his money. But they
discovered , they liked it, so one; evening
I in^ every week they en joyed together at
! some performance or anotherâ with> a pre
ference for exhibition of .sentiment which
their lives had "denied themâ "and: went
| afterward to a modest little supper, in
: one ; or another of the city's eating
; houses. . . v )
! Mr. Greene bad rather> given up going
to church; buf he never let Mrs. Greene
suspect that such was the fact by. his con
duct." and they were regularly members
of the church they had been brought up
in at-home. vThe weekdays were filled for
Mrs. Greene by attendance upon lectures
and | the thousand and one places which
Chicago throws open free to those who
care for : them.* She read a great deal,
and liked to go to the public library for
her own books. When leisure afforded
they; went together, , and together saw all
the sights of the city.
This has gone on for twenty years, but
there has never been anything but com
fort and happiness for this now aging
couple. The world Is, perhaps, not greatly
the better for their continued presence in
it, yet it is assuredly none the worse.
And for now many of us can that be
said? \u25a0 -

FOR PHILANTHROPY
Mr. Clark is of the opinion that no
permanent solution of the labor problem
Jn the islands would be found until there
is a larger eupply of resident labor. He
said that a systematic effort to secure
the settlement cf homesteads would prob
ably mett with success and that he
thought the Government as well as the
labor organizations would look with ap
proval upon an attempt to bring white la
borers to Hawaii. Clark said that the
whole nation is concerned in the prob
lem of building up a community of high
civic character and ability in the islands,
and that he did not see how it could be
done without a larger fixed population in
the group.

LABOR CONDITIONS
Railway mail clerks galore, two hun
dred and fifty of themâ all who could
leave through any excuse, fjood or badâ
praybeards and the cubs, not an or
ganization, merely good fellows all, for
t 800k 1 the service of Uncle Sam for five
hours last night to gather around Del
monico's banquet table, there to do honor
to their long time chief and longer time
friend. Alexander Hamilton Stephens of
Oakland, superintendent of the Eighth
Division. Railway Mail Service.
i From everywhere they had comeâ Alas- '
ka, Yukon. Seattle, Spokane, Portland.
Ogyien, Salt Lake, Albuquerque, Los An-
Kf>les. Sacramento, Oakland and San '
Franciscoâ until there were gathered
around the board representatives from
every "run" between the coast and the
Rocky Mountains. Those few who could
not come, for the mails cannot stop even
for fo unusual an occasion as this, sent
in telegram after telegram, a veritable
shower of them, expressing their sorrow
at not being there to grasp their chief by
the hand and personally wish him many
more years of success.
The dinner was given by the men to
chow their appreciation of the work of
Superintendent Stephens. A man reared
on a California ranch. Stephens had en
tered the mail service as a young man
and by persistent effort rose from the
ranks to the position he now holds. He
is loved by the men under his direction,
and when Mail Clerk J. J. Buchanan,
running out of Sacramento, rose at the
head of the long table and plainly told
in his introductory speech the admira
tion they all felt for their chief, ear burst
ing applause followed and kept up until
Superintendent Stephens raised his hand
that he might be heard. In a few words
the superintendent thanked his men and
told them, in turn, how he had appreci
ated the earnest way in which they had
*11 worked under him.
The banquet hall was beautifully decor
ated. In the foreground were two Im
mense American flags and under them
the blue banner of the mail service.
Postmasters from many States had sent
in flowers and ferns, and they were
strung in great profusion above the table.
These decorations were in charge of J. J.
Carroll, Portland Division, William Me-
Manus, Ogden Division, and Homer A.
Swaney, Los Angeles Division, whose ef
forts made the affair the success that it
was. The programme of toasts and enter
tainment was as follows:
The run is good, the lay-off good,
\u25a0 <Jood pay day comes all kinds of weather;
The chlet is good, the boys are rood.
And Tie' re all good fellows together.
" Forithis occasion the "orchestra will

casion; :
Particularly strong features of the
bill have already been arranged, by

lovers of the drama. The entertainment
will probably open with an act from

the professional stage as King Charles
11. Others in the cast; will be Lucius

pearance in six years in San Francisco
as Mephistopheles, tho cbAracter "in
which he : has won fame -and fortune.
Lucius Henderson will appear as, Faust
and Miss Florence Roberts as Marguer
ite. There will also be the memorable
music-poem, entitled "The Ballad of De-,
spair," with . Mrs. j Lillian Birmingham
and Miss Roberts as the principal inter
preters. , â¢â¢
The star event, of; the bill, however,
will be, the trial scene from "The Mer
chanfof Veniqe," which will haveal
most a star \u25a0 cast, Mr.'. Morrison appear
ing as Shylock, Herschel MayaU'as Bas
sanio,' Mr. Henderson as^ Gratlano,- Paul

at Delraar racetrack to-day and an
nounced that any attempt at betting or
bookmaklng would result .in- arrests.
The races were run. but there was no
betting, the ring being deserted. Com
paratively few spectators were present.
Former Judge Chester Krnm. repre
senting the Central Turf Association,
the body behind the effort being made
to bet on horse races without violat
ing the new anti-betting law, depart
ed for Jefferson City to-night for the
purpose of suing out a writ of prohi
bition before the State Supreme Court
to prevent the Circuit Court of St.
Louis County from trying the case of
the men who have been arrested on
charges of. violating the new statute.
It is understood that the application
for the writ will be based on claims
that the anti-betting law contains an
error which ' makes It unconstitutional.
The principal object of Judge Krum's
trip, it is said, is to bring the matter
directly before the Supreme Court
without waiting for the action of the
lower court. Summary:

,to help the Seals to victory. > â¢ -
In the disastrous â¢ first- Baum: walked
Spencer."; Smith. then made a wild throw
of Waldron's attempted sacrifice,, allow
ing Spencer to take third. -To cap the
climax Wheeler .connected with the
sphere for three bags, scoring ; both
Spencer and Waldron. Before the "Loo
Loos finally managed to retire three men
the Seals made another tally. This ended
the scoring until the fifth, when Los An
geles ; landed a run principally ' because
Jimmy Whalen walked a man when the
bases were full, forcing a run. ; â¢:

scored in ; their half of the fifth. This

Pagefs California bred colt. Cairngorm,
wan the .Bay Ridge Handicap worth $3150
to the winner toÂ«-day In the easiest pos
sible manner. The distance, one mile and
a quarter, is an ideal one for all who
love a good race and the spectacle was an
Interesting one. Although Cairngorm was
always in a common canter after the er
ratic Graziallo had led for nearly seven
furiongs, there was a question whether
the Paget colt could outrun either Jac-
QUin or the much messed about Colonial
Girl once the stretch was reached. That
Question was soon settled and with W.
Davis sitting perfectly still on Cairn
gorm, he passed the judges nearly two
lengths in advance of Jacquln. Outcome
came from the rear and earned third

Pretended Factoiy Does
Not Exist in Haywards
The .' police were] notified. -Detectives
Graham and Harrison- of the Mission dis
trict arrested : Nathan Otterbeck, seven
teen years of age," and he was , identified
by \u25a0 Smith : as;. the youth who attempted to
hold him "up. Yesterday morning Otter
beck was booked at the City Prison on a
charge' of assault to commit robbery. A
revolver and"' twenty' cartridges were
found in his pockets .and his brother
identified the weapon |as belonging to
him.' Nathan had broken into his room
at their father's house. Nineteenth and
De Haro streets, and stolen the weapon.
He "believed Nathan intended; to shoot
him. Nathan is an incorrigible youth
and has . been in trouble for years for
petty, larceny and "burglary. His father
is a hooseraiser, and has given up hope
of reforming the boy. Nathan denies at
tempting? to rob v Smith and says his
brother had him arrested for spite.
Two young men and two young girls
saved Fernando /A. Smith of 518 Utah
street, from the clutches of a masked
footpad on Tltah, street, between Eigh
teenth and Mariposa, a ' few ' minutes
before midnight Sunday night,'* Smith
and the young; men and girls had left
a car, and Smith walked quickly along
the block on | his way * home: There is a
building, in course of erection about the
center of ; : the block, and -when Smith
reached it the" footpad, wearing a white
handkerchief over â¢ his face, stepped 'out,
and presenting a revolver at Smith's head
ordered him tohand over his money.
"I" haven't any money," replied \u25a0 Smith.
The footpad said he did not believe him
and threatened Jo shoot. Smith shouted
for help and the " yonug ,men and girls,
who | had been walking leisurely behind
Smith, .ran forward to see :what was ; the
matter. / The footpad fired Â«\u25a0 a shot at
Smith and disappeared, through the new
building. ;'\u25a0 Smith was jso close to the foot
pad when the : shot was , fired that he
cannot understand why. the bullet did : not

Serious charges were made against E.
Ghirardelll in a suit filed in the' Superior
Court yesterday by Attorney L. E. Burks
for C.C. Shepard, in which damages are
sought for money expended in purchase
of stock of the E. Ghirardelll Mercantile
Company, as alleged by Shepard. A simi
lar suit is to follow, so it is announced, in
which the complainant is Joseph Hess.
Shepard alleges, through ; his complaint,
that Ghirardelli is the president of the E.
Ghlrardelli Mercantile* Company ; that as
such officer- and as principal stockholder
Ghirardelll has at all times known that
the company was operated at a loss, and
it is set ui> that' it never had, at any
time, "an alleged factory at Haywards."
California, or elsewhere. . The language
of the complaint is in part as follows,
referring, to the acts of Ghlrardelli:
He represented, on and prior to April 28, 19C5.
to } said plaintiff that : said corporation wai
then, and ever, since the organization thereof,
had been paying out of the net profits of the
business of said corporation monthly dividends
upon . its capital stock amounting to - per
centum of- the' par ~ value of each and every
share \u25a0of the issued capital stock and that
said corporation held and ownwl a factory at
Haywards, Cal., for the manufacture of all
the catsup and pickles sold by it In its busi
ness as a wholesale and retail dealer tn catsup
and pickles artd that ths net proflt u>-said
corporation , on the sale of said catsup and
pickles so .manufactured by said corporation
was at least 50 per centum of the cost price
of manufacture of the same; and said defend
ant further. represented to said plaintiff that
as president" and manager and principal stock
holder of said corporation- he had special fa
cilities for gaining, ar.l had gained, a full
and complete knowledge of all the business
and property ' of said corporation and of its
financial, condition at - all - times since Its or
ganization.
Shepard alleges, that each and every onÂ©
of I the representations made by Ghirar
delli in the foregoing was untrue.but. by
reaWn of them, he, Shepafd, bought 500
shares of the capital stock of the com
pany at par value. This stock, he al
leges, he has learned is "\u25a0worthless.

The market showed greatest- strength just bs

potent influence. Another factor 'that â¢ helped :
to strengthen . prices > late-ln-tho 1 : day: was; a
decrease In primary receipts, arrivals * to-day \u25a0
being 281.700 bushels, compared * with ; 340.000

LOCAL MARKETS.
Cotton.
â¢ Broker*' wlÂ«s from New York yesterday
Â»â¢ raid: ,7 Â¥g 6or3e time ago we called your atten
tion to the great possibilities as we saw them
sit that time in the cotton market. Since then
the market has advanced steadily and at no
llrr.e. could a loss have been made. We again
*rica to call your attention to the market. The
crop, even If it shows no further setbacks in
condition, â¢will not come up to the world's re
quirements. Conservative opinion Is now for
. a 'crop of considerable less than 11.000,000
bales, with about 1.250.000 In reserve from the
old. crop. The world's requirements are 12.
/jOO.GOO bales. The market Is broad and has
t. Nad ' considerable steam, but there Is much
. merit on the bull aide. Last year's 1 larye crop
brought- about 8.60 cents, per pound. Mills are
Â«ot stocked with rood or raw material. Cot
ton on its merits can easily sell much higher.'?
' Trade In fresh fruits was chiefly of. a routine
local character, there being very little move
ment' ln\ shipping channels, 'and the market
remained' weak for nearly everything on the
list. Currants.' strictly, fancy Apples and
Citrus fruits were firm, while every thing else
ruled weak, with supplies far In excess of the
demand: The ' warm weather stimulated trade
In Melons Â» but/ as: supplies exceeded require
ments prices ranged lower. . Cantaloupes arÂ«
arriving from Coachella at the rate of a par
load a day. and Watermelons. are coming for
ward freely from the same place. Some ex

more Impression on" the stockholders to-day
than any time since the speculation first
showed signs Of revival early last week. The
campaign for the advance was not " abandoned
by any means and operations to lift prices
further were still conspicuously In evidence,
but they were shifting to new quarters of the
list and embraced stocks whose movements
are not of such widespread sympathetic effect
on the rest of the market. Meantime the
prominent market leaders in - which the
etrMigth hitherto has centered were subjected
to seUlng to take profits. It would be difficult
to . say how far the selling was promoted by
any change In conditions and how far merely
as a result of the accrued profits on the ad
vance hitherto. AÂ« the rise has gone on with
trifling Interruptions for six days the profits
to those who have held stocks from the be
ginning are attractive. The outward move
ment of gold Inaugurated yesterday was much
discussed and doubtless was the Impelling
v motlve for a good part of the "selling. Great
confidence wai professed, nevertheless, that' the
present resources of our money market can
spare a considerable outgo of gold on French
demand. The money market to-day was not
materially affected, although a firmer tone
was reported on time loans. The atmosphere \u25a0
of foreign politics was declcedly clear, and
there was a smart recovery on the Paris
Bourse. There were considerable purchases of
stocks here for foreign account, but with little
effect on our own market. With no available
steamers sailing to-morrpw, the question of
further pold exports this week was in abeyance.
Discount rates advanced, however, both In
London and Paris. Foreign exchange, rates
here were only slightly lower on foreign buy-
Ing of stocks, the gold engaged for export evi
dently providing no supply of exchange for
th e market. It Is supposed, therefore, that
other causes than the friction with Germany
are responsible for the Paris demand for. gold,
poeslbly preparation for. a Russian indemnity.
There was a rather pronounced desire attend
ing the speculative contingent, reflected in the
hesitating tone of the stock market, to see
how far the gold outflow is likely to extend
and what the consequences may be to the
money market. Weather conditions In the crop
regions were reported favorab.e to . the crops
to-day and consequently favorable to values of
railroad stocks but the mixed complexion 'of
the weekly bulletin of the Weather Bureau
served to confuse to some extent the conclu
sions over the crop conditions. Much stress
continues to b e laid on the prospects for divi
dend Increases by the conductors of the pres
ent speculative movement, as the appeal is
design*^ to be made" largely to those having
thÂ«> disposition of the proceeds of the coming
July dividend and in the payments. The ef
forts to continue the rise, however, proved
unavailing and before the end of the day a
definite reactionary tendency was established,
although remnants of the early advances made
a mixed showing of gains and losses for the
day. ' - â¢ '

ELIASSEX'CASE GOES OVER.â The cita

uralization papers should not be revoked, ths
orck-r . hclns -. issued . upon affidavit of - R. -H.
Taj-lof of the. Treasury. Department that Ellas
sen had rrocurred 'his papers fraudulently,
was put" over yesterday for hearing on Thurs
day.vEliaFsen says h^can easily prove that he
obtained.hls papers legally and is entltled-to
keep them. - x ' ;
They are not like other girls;
:~ During the Manchuria's voyage
across the Pacific, at almost any hour
of the day or evening, except meal
times, in a" cozy corner, of that mascu
line paradise, the smoking-room, the
short-cropped woman -^doctor from
the Kaiser's realm _, and Mrs. .Nau
mann, her rosy-cheeked " friend,
could be- found, 'chatting quiet
ly 'and each puffing on a long,'
black cigar. And when thirst troubled
the smokers the cigars, were laid aside
and, fair^ lips sipped "Scotch" from the
biggest -"tumblers . furnished by the
Manchuria's commissary department.
'And* they are proud of It.
"I : have smoked for twenty years,"
boasts Dr. -Heydel. .â¢Â»'
"I like, German cigars, best of all,"
admits Mrs/ Naumann.'. *
- But each of them paid^ duty on sev
eral hundred Manila t cigars.
.'To' smoke on the way home," they
explained to the bewildered customs
inspector who searched their baggage.
, Mrs. G. Naumann.and Miss Elizabeth
Heydel are from Germany, .where Miss
lleydel.V who "wears her hair cropped
close to a well shaped head, is a doctor
of medicine.* They are traveling around
the woild. and landed here yesterday
from the liner Manchuria. Except for
the brevity of the Heydel locks these
two gentle "globe-trotters, well groomed
'and wearing, many of the outward
'signs of awell-lined pocketbook, would
attract .Atle attention on the crowded
-decks' of ;a liner ; or In the thronged
corridor of a hotel. But on the Man
churia, ,tÂ»iis pair of wanderers from

tion than 'did' MoJor General Leonard

2 Clarice McCurdy, at whose side walked

: she had "Just escaped an assault by Mre.

Detective Tom Gibson seized Charlotta's
arm before the blow could fall and- said
quickly, . "None, of that." Mrs. Collins
dropped, her. -ann and turned from the
room, all a tremble.
The women arrayed on the two sides of
the Collins case have been wrought up
to a fighting pitch and a face scratching
clash -"was narrowly averted yesterday at
the Hall of Justice. Mrs. Charlotta Col

McCyrdy, Collins* Chicago wife. The look
of_detennination.that rests upon the coun
tenance of Charlotta and the angry snap
In. the* eyes of Clarice and her mother are
Indications that a mix-up among the
women would leave no back hair combs
or miMinery trimmings in place and the
staying hand of an officer prevented what
might have been a serious encounter.
When Mrs. McCurdy and her daughter
left the courtroom, where Judge Lennon
had just ordered- another continuance of
the Collins bigamy case, they hurried into
the branch County Clerk's office, just
across the corridor, to avoid the gaze of
the usual Collins day crowd. Mrs. Char
lotta Collins and her mother came out
directly behind them. Anger overcame
Mrs. CoHins as she saw the McCurdys
pass, into the County Clerk's office. Her
face white, her body shaking, she tight
ened her hold on the handle of a chate
laine bag. she carried and darting through
the door behind Clarice McCurdy raised
the bag. -to strike her.
