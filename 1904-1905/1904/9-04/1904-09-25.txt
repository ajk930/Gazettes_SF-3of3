to cut in at Lady. Angela's table. Anna,
do you not see that the Countess is sit

He recognized the force," almost the
passion, which trembled in her tone,
and he at once abandoned the subject.
He remained talking with her, however.
It was easy for him to see that- she
desired to be agreeable to him. They
talked lightly but confidentially until
Sir John approached them with a slight
frown upon his face.
"bur 1 would rather talk of something
else. I suppose you will think me very
unsisterly and cold-hearted, but there
are circumstances In connection with

"In Paris," he interrupted, "she was
a very delightful companion, but be
yond that â one did 'not take her seri

She raised her eyebrows to his and
smiled into his face.
"Do you mean in looks?" she asked.
"Not only that," he answered. "In
Paris your sister appeared to me to be

tJpter permits me to call myself her

"And In Paris "
The change in "Lady Ferringhajl's

"I see nothing of my sister," she said.
"In, Paris our lives were far apart, and
v.e hnd seldom the came friends. I have
heard of you from my husband. You
are somebody's secretary, are you not?"
It was plain that the subject was dis
tasteful to her, but Ennison, although
famous in a email 1 way for his social
tact, did not at onco discard It.
"You have not seen your sister late
ly." he remarked. "I believe that you
would find her in some respects curi
ously altered. I have never In my life
been so much puzzled by any one as
by your rister. Something has changed
her "tremendously."

said "do you know that I am a very
great admirer of your sister's? I won

"It is unimportant." she said. "No
body understands them, of course, but
we all look as though we did. Some
thing about this woman rather re
minds me of our hostess."
Ennison thought so too half an hour
later, when having cut out from one
of the bridge tables he settled down
for a chat with Annabel. Every now
and then something familiar In her
tone, the poise of her head, the play
of her eyes startled him. Then he re
membered that she was Anna's sister.
He lowered, his voice a little ;.nd
leaned toward her.
"Every one raves about. her," Lady
Angela continued. "For my part I can

"Alcide's songs are not atrociot s,"

Lady Angela shrugged her shoulders.

Hill. It wasn't altogether my fault.
I was led Into It. I was mistaken
for him so often that I Â¦ got - tired
of correcting people. And then Made
moiselle Celeste found out. and she
only laughed. She advised ms to keep
It up. She told me that it was my only
chance of getting you to look at me.
And you know how I was about you.
Every one knew. It was the sort of
thing I'd heard of, but never under
stood. The thought of you was like a
fever in my blood. I couldn't sleep or
eat or rest for thinking about you. It's
hard to talk about â and befors him."
he pointed -to Brendon. "but as I was
then so I am now. I knew that I was
a cad to let you marry me, believing
I was Meysey Hill. I can't help It now.
It's past and done with. What I want
to say to you is this. We're man and
wife, bound hard and fast. We can't
getaway from it. Won't yon let by
gones be bygones, and make the best
of it? . I'm not a rich man. I'm trav
eler for a firm of brewers and wine
merchants, but I don't do badly, and
you! could keep on your show at thÂ«
music halls if you wanted to. I'd do
anything for you in reason. I â I'm not
a bad sort really, though that Meysey
Hill business was shabby. Come, what
do you. say?"
He was nervous. His twitching; fea
tures showed it. There were drops of
perspiration upon his forehead. His
hand was extended half doubtfully.
Anna did ' not take It. but there was
something of pitv as well as contempt
In -her stead v regard of him.
"Is this -all?" she asked.*
"All!" he repeated vaguely.
â¢ver meanj 1 naa to use I would keep
my promise. I would free you from

She shook her head.

ANNA THE ADVENTURESS"Do you know," she said, "that every
one Is remarking how 111 you look. I
too can see it. What has been the mat
ter?"
"Toothaci.4" be answered laconically.
She locked away.
"You might at least," she murmured,
"have invented a more romantic
reason."
She looked at him with curious eyes.
"I remember," she said, "that the
first r.isht I saw you, you spoke of my
tister as your friend. Have you seen
much of her lately?"
"Nothing at all," he answered.
The small gray feathers of her ex
quisitely shaped fan waved gently
backward and forward. She was
watching him intently.
"For heaven's sake no," she declared.
"I would rather put up with your own
efforts, however clumsy. Love-making
at first hand is dull enough. At second
hand it would be unendurable."
He leaned towards her.
"Is that a challenge?"
She shrugged her shoulders, all
ablaze with jewels.
"Why not? It might amuse me."
Somewhat Irrelevantly he glanced at
the next few boxes where the rest of
Mrs. Montrcssor's guests were.
"Is your husband here to-night?" hÂ«
asked.
"My husband!" "she laughed a little
derisively. "No, he wouldn't come here
of all placesâ Just now. He dined and
then pleaded a political engagement.
I was supposed to do the same, but I
didn't."
"You know,** he said with some hesi
tation, "that your sister Is singing."
She nodded. - .Â¦-.. "V^
"Of course. I want to hear how she
fioes it"
"She docs it magnificently," he de
clared. "I thinkâ we all think that she
Is xvonderful."
"I tv ill buy books and a lay figure,**
he declared, "to practice upon. Or
shaU I ask Colonel Anson a few
hints r*
Lady Fc-rringhall lifted her eyes to
the newcomer, and the greeting in
them was obviously meant for him
alone. She continued to fan herself.
"You are late," ehe murmured.
"My chief." he said, "took it into
his head to have an impromptu dinner
party. He brought home a few wav
erers to talk to them where they had
no chance -cf getting away."
Ebe nodded.
"I am bored." she said abruptly.
"This is a very foolish sort of enter
tainment- And, as usual, " she con
tinued, a little bitterly, "I seem to have
been sent along with the dullest and
least edifying of Mrs. Montressor's
guests."
Ennison glanced at the other people
In the box and smiled.
"I got your note just in .time." he
remarked. "I knew of course that you
xvere at the Montressors'. but I had
no idea that it was a music hall party
afterward. Are you all here?"
"Five boxes full." she answered.
"Some of them seem to be having an
fully good time, too. Did you see Lord
Delafield and Miss Anderson? They
packed me in with Colonel Anson and
Mrs. Hitch ings, who se*>: to be ab
solutely engrossed in one another, and
a boy of cbout seventeen, who no
eooner got here than he discovered
that he wanted to see a man in the
promenade and disappeared."
Ennison at onc<* fated himself.
"I foe! justified then," he said, "in
annexing this chair. I expect you had
been snubbing him terribly."
"Well, he was presumptuous," Anna
bel remarked, "and he wasn't nice
about it. 1 wender how It is." she add
ed, "that boys always make love so
Impertinently."
Ennison laughed softly.
"I wonder." he said, "how you would
like to be made love to â boldly or tim
orously or sentimentally."
"Are you a master of all three metli
ods?" she asked, stopping her fanning
for a moment to look at him.
"Indeed, no," he answered. "Mine Is
a primitive and unstudied manner. It
needs cultivating, I think."
His fingers touched hers for a mo
ment under the ledge of the box.
"That sounds so uncouth," she mur
mured. "I detest amateurs."
Annabel and "Alcidc.**
CHAITER XXII.
"I will think of It." she promised.
"You must do more than think of It,"
he urged. , '/It is intolerable that you
should be followed; about by such a
creature. I am sure that he can be got
rid of." -
She turned and looked at him. Her
face scarcely reflected his enthusiasm.
Â¦"It may be more difficult, than you
think." she v iald. "You see, you don't
"I am afraid." she murmured, "that
It would be difficult. He really deserves
a better fate, does he not? He is so
beautifully persistent."
He drew a little nearer to her. The
lamp was not yet lit, and In the dim
light he bent forward as though trying
to look Into her averted face. He
t&.tched her hand, soft and cool to the
fingersâ she turned at once to look at
him. Her eyes were perhaps a little
brighter than usual, the firelight played
about her. hair, there seemed to him to
bo a sudden softening of the straight,
firm mouth. Nevertheless she with
drew her hand.
"Let me help you." he begged. "In
deed, you could have no more faithful
friendâ you could find no one more anx
ious to serve you."
Her hand fell back Into her lap. He
touched It again, and this time It was
not withdrawn.
That Is very nice of you,** she said.
"But it is so difficultâ" Â¦Â¦: .
"Not at all," he answered eagerly.
"I wish you would come and see my
lawyers. Of course. I know nothing of
what really did happen In Paris 1 â If
even you ever saw him there. You need
not tell me, but a lawyer Is different.
His client's story is safe with him. He
would advise you how to get rid of the
fellow. V
Anna recovered her spirits with mar
velous facility. -It was Ennison who
for the rest of his visit was quiet and
subdued.
"You are absurd," she declared. "It
was unpleasant while it lasted, but it
la overâ and my toasted scones are de
licious. Do have another."
"It is over for now," he answered,
**but I cannot bear to think that you
are subject to this sort of thing."
She shrugged her shoulders slightly.
Some of the delicate color which the
afternoon walk had brought into her
cheeks had already returned.
"It is an annoyance, my friend,"
she said, "not a tragedy."
"It might become one," he answered.
"The man is dangerous."
She looked thoughtfully Into the flre.
"I am afraid," she said, "that he
must have a skeleton key to these
rooms. If so I shall have to leave."
"You cannot play at hide-and-seek
with this creature all your life." he
answered. "Let your friends act for
you. There must be ways of getting
rid of him." :^*.\
"You need not be alarmed," he
said. "I do not wish to use this. I
came here peaceably and I only ask
for a few words with you. But I
rnean to have them. No, you don't!"
Ennison had moved stealthily a lit
tle nearer to him and looked suddenly
Into the dark muzzle of the- revolver.
"If you interfere between us," the
man said, "it will go hardly^with you.
This lady is my wife and I have a
right to be here. I have the right also
to throw you out."
Ennison obeyed Anna's gesture and
was silent.
"You can say what you have to say
before Mr. Ennison, if at all," Anna
declared calmly- "In any case, I de
cline to see you alone."
"Very well," the man answered. "I
have come to tell you this: You are
my wife and I am determined to
claim you. We were properly mar
ried and the certificate is at my law
yer's. I am not a madman, or a
pauper, or even an unreasonable per
son. I know that you were" disap
pointed because I did not turn out to
be a millionaire. Perhaps I deceived
you about it. However, that's over
and done with. I'll make any reason
able arrangement you like. I don't
want to stop your singing. You can
live just about how you like. But you
belong to me â and I want you."
He paused for a moment and then
suddenly continued. His voice had
broken. He spoke In quick, nervous
sentences.
"You did your best to kill me," he
said. "You might have given me a
chance, anyway. I'm not such a bad
scrt. You know â I worship you. I
have done so from the first moment
I saw you* I can't rest or work or
settle down to anything while things
are like this between you and me. I
want you. I've got to have you, and
by God I will." " . *
He took a quick step forward. Anna
held out her hand and he paused.
There was something which chilled
even him in the cold impassivity of
her features.
"Listen," she said. * "I have heard
these things from you before, and you
have had my answer. Understand once
and for all that that answer is final.
I do not admit the truth of a word
which you have said. I will not be
persecuted in this way by you."
"You do not deny that you are my
wife?" he asked hoarsely. "You can
not. Oh, you cannot."
"I have denied it," she answered.
"Why will you .not be sensible? Go
back to your old life and your old
friends and forget all about Paris and
this absurd delusion of yours."
"Delusion!" he muttered, glaring at
her. "Delusion!"
"You ! can call It what you like." she
aaid. "In any case you will never re
ceive any different sort of answer from
me." Stay where you are, Mr. Ennlaon."
With a swift movement she gained
the bell and rang it. The man's hand
flashed out. but immediately afterward
an oath and a cry of pain broke from
his lips.- The pistol fell to the floor.
Ennison kicked It away with hl3 foot.
"I shall send for a policeman," Anna
said, "directly my maid answers the
bell â unless you choose to go before."
The man made no attempt to recover
the revolver. He walked unsteadily
toward the door.
"Very well," he said, "I will go. But,"
and he faced them both with a still ex
pressionless glance, "this is not the
end!"
He raised his hand and they saw
that he was holding a small revolver.
"Why not?" he exclaimed. "I have
the right to be here.^ I hid because
there was no other way of seeing you.
I did not reckon upon â him."
He pointed to Ennison, who In his
turn .looked across at Anna,
"You wish me to stay?" he asked In
a low tone.
"I would not have you go for any
thing," she answered.
"Nevertheless," Hill said doggedly.
"I am here to speak to you alone."
"If you do not leave the room at
once," Anna answered calmly, "I shall
ring the bell for a policeman."
Ennison sprang up, but he never
reached the curtains. They were sud
denly thrown aside and a man stepped
out from his hiding place. A little ex
clamation of surprise escaped Ennison.
Anna sprang to her feet with a startled
csy.
"You!" she exclaimed. "What are
you doing here? How dare you come
to* my rooms!"
The man stepped into the middle
of the room. " The last few months
had not dealt kindly with Mr. Mon
tague Hill. He was still flashily
dressed, with much obvious Jewelry
and the shiniest of patent boots, but
his general bearing and appearance
had altered for the worse. His cheeks
were puffy and his eyes bloodshot. He
had the appearance of a man who had
known no rest for many nights. His
voice when he spoke was almost
fiercely assertive, but there was an un
dernote of nervousness.
grim and silent now, for It was
long past/ midnight. For a mo
ment her thoughts led her back
to the evening when she and Courtlaw
had , stood â¢ together before the window
of her studio in Parts, before the com
ing Jof Sir John had made so many
changes in her life.. She was silent, the
ghost of a fading smile passed from her
lips. 'She had made her way since then
a little farther Into the heart of life.
Yet even now tliere were so many
things untouched, so much , to be
learned. To-night she had a curious
feeling that she stood upon the thresh
old of some change. The great untrod
den world, was. before her still, into
which no one can pass alone.. She felt a
new warmth in her blood; a strange
sense of elation crept over her. Sorrows
and danger and , disappointment she
had .known. Perhaps the day of her
recompense was at hand. She glanced
into her companion's face and she saw
there strange things. For a moment
her heart seemed to stop beating. Then
she dropped the curtain and stepped
back into the room. Sydney was strum
ming over a new song which, stood
upon the piano. ' -,
"I am sure," she said, "that you
mean to stay until you are turned out.
Do you see the time?"
"I may come and see you?" Ennison
asked, as his band touched herÂ»
"As to all that nonsense we> have
been listening to." she continued, fold
ing up her veil upon her knee, "well,
the man's inad. There's no more to be
said about it."
"Just so." hÂ«Â» repeated. "The man
must be mad."
Brendon standing now by
Anna's side. He was taller than Hill,
but Hill was very powerfully built and
he was beside himself with passion.
The veins stood out on his forehead
like purple cords. He spoke in little
jerks.
"I came to talk the matter overâ
reasonablv." he said. "I was willing
to be fuir and square about It. But I
aren't be bluffed to my face, I won't
be titiated as though I we- a fool or
a madman. Once more, are you my
wife or are you not?"
"I am most cei tainly not your wife,"
she answered calmly. "As ta your
threats, well. I have had quite enough
of them, and of you. I have given you
an opportunity to speak and you have
Kpuken. So have I"
t5he rÂ£i:o: the bell. Hill swayed upon
his feet as though about to spring
cither at her or at Bren.on, who was
watchins him closely. The maidser
vant appeared.
"The clour. Mary, to this i, Uleman,"
Anna said.
There was a moment's dead silence.
Then Mill took up his hat. He made
s'^ropkis movement toward the door.
He seemed crushed. The carnation in
his coat soemed to have lost its vivid
color, his diamond pi:Â» to have gone
dull. A curious ncgativencss seemed
to have spread over the man and his
glossy clothes, extending even to the
utterly emotionless tone in which he
6pÂ«.ke his k'ct words to Anna.
"I came," he said, "prepared for
peace. I would have listened to any
thir.s reasonable- from you. You have
choEon war. You think perhaps that
this ?5 the end. It is not even the be
ginnir.a'."
Brerdon interposed, sneaking- for the
first time sir:ee the man's entrance.
"One monier.t." he said. "Of thÂ«
msuer which lies between this lady
and you. I know nothing. But whether
your story ir, true c-r false you had bet
ter remember this. Miss Pellissier's
friends will s-.eo that you are not allow
ed to annoy her. You can take this
from me. If you make the slightest
attempt to force your presence upon
her I will ihra?h you first and have
you up before the magistrates after
ward."
Kill listened to him patiently. When
he had finished he left ths room. They
heard the street tlocr close behind him.
Brendon looked half fearfully toward
Anna. Sho had drawn her chair up to
the fire and her finders were busy with
her hatpins.
"What an exhausting afternoon!"
slip exclaimed brightly. "Do ring the
bell for tea. please. You can stop, 11
you like. I believe Mary has muffins."
"Thank you." he said, dropping into
a <hair.
"You simply mock me, then," he
cried. "It's a damned silly way to deal
Â¦with a man. We know the truth, you
as well as L Yet you keep the bluff
up, even when we are here alone. Is it
because Brendon is here? If so, by
Cod, I'll throw him down the stairs."
She was really - Ilk* her lister, he
thought. Impressed for a moment by
the soft brilliancy of her smile. Her
fingers rested upon his.
" You were really at Moulton House,"
she exclaimed penitently. "I am so
sorry. I had a perfect shoal of callers.
People who would not go. I only ar
rived when everybody was coming
away."
A little murmur of expectation, an
audible silence announced the coming
of "A'cide." Then a burst of applause.
She was standing there, smiling at the
audience as at her friends. From the
first there had always been between
her and her listeners that electrical
sympathy which only a certain order of
genius seems able to create. Then she
sang.
Ennison listened and his eyes glowed.
Lady Ferringhall listened and her
cheeks grew pale. Her whole face
stiffened with suppressed anger. She
forgot Anna's sacrifices, forgot her own
callousness, forgot the burden which
she had fastened upon her sister's
shoulders. She was fiercely and bit
terly jealous. Anna was singing as she
used to sing. She was chic, dis
tinguished, unusual. What right had
she to call herself "Alcide"? It was
abominable, an imposture. Ennison lis
tened and he forgot where he was. He
forgot Annabel's idle attempts at love
making, all the cul-de-sac gallantry of
â¢ Again on his way homeward from
Cavendish Square he abandoned the
direct route to pass by the door of
Anna's flat. Impassive by nature and
training, he was conscious to-night of
a strange sense of excitement, of ex
hilaration tempered by. a dull back
ground of disappointment. Her sister
"Don't tempt me," she said, laugh
ing, and drawing her opera-cloak to
gether. "You shall drive home with
me in a hansom, if you will. That is
quite as far as I mean to tempt Provi
dence to-night."
"Do you mind," Annabel said, "talk-
Ing about something else, or fetch-
Ing back my; recalcitrant cavalier?"
"Anything except that," he mur
mured. "I was half hoping that I
might' be allowed to see' you home."
"If you can tear yourself away from
this delightful place in five minutes,"
she answered. "I think I -can get rid
of the others."
"We will do It," he declared. "If
only Sir John were not Sir John I
would ask you to come and have
some supper. , . .
"Don't Imperil my reputation before
I am established," she answered, smil
ing. "Afterward It seems to me that
there are no limits to what one may
not do among one's own set." ,
"I am frightened of Sir John," he
said, "but I suggest that we risk it.'?
"This is indeed a gaia ni<-ht.** he
said, raising his giass, and watching
for a moment the polden bubblea^ ;
"Was it really only this afternoon that!
I met you in St. James Park?"
She nodded and made a careful se-Â§
lection from a dish cf qu.Jls.
"It was just an hour before teatlme,"?
she remarked. "I have had nothing,
since, and it seems a very long tlme.T
"An appetite like yours," he said re
signedly, "is fatal to all sentiment."" 1
"Not in the least." she assured him.'.'
"I find the two inseparable."
He sighed. '
"I have noticed," he said, "that you? f

very dense. Besides, your remark iai
not in the least complimentary. I have I
always understood that men avoid like

So they talked on -while supper was
served, falling easily into the spirit

easily the most noticeable and thai

the room. To-night there seemed ttr^
be a new brilliancy in her eyes, a
deeper quality in her tone. She was;
herself conscious of a recklessness of
spirits almost hysterical. Perhaps, af->
ter all, the others were right. PerÂ«Â£
haps she had found this new thing inl
life, the thing wonderful. The ter-j

from the memory. Ax\ acute sense ot 1
living was in her veins, even the taste I
of her wine seemed magical. Ennisoc I
too, always handsome and debonair gj
seemed transported out of his calm I
self. His tongue was more ready, his I
wit more keen than usual. He said I
daring things with a grace which if
made them irresistible. his -eyes Â¦
flashed, back upon her some eloquent Â¦
but silent appreciation .of the change I
in her manner toward him. II
And then there came for both oil
them at least a temporary awakening Â¦
It was he who saw them first cominf Â¦
down the room â Annabel in a won- Â¦
derful white satin gown in front, and!
Sir John stiff, unbending, disapprov-B
ing, bringing up the rear. He bent Â¦
over to Anna at once. ti
"It is your sister and her husband." Â¦
he said. "They are coming past ouiH
table." ||
Annabel saw Ennison first, and no-ffl
ticing his single companion calmljB
ignored him. Then making a pretensÂ«B
of stooping to rearrange her flowing Â¦
train, she glanced at Anna, and haliH
stopped in her progress down theflj
room. Sir John followed her gazel|
and also saw them. His face cloud-H
ed with anger. |J
It was after all a momentary affair fg
Annabel passed on with a stramecM
nod to her sister, and Sir John's bovB
was a miracle of icy displeasure. ThejÂ«
vanished through the doorway, AnmB
and her escort exchanged glances. Al m

laughing. j
"How do you feel? she asxed.. I 1

She threw open the door and pointed;
to it. .
"My word holds," she said. "If you:
Bpeak â farewell."
He stood quite silent for a moment. 1
his eyes fixed upon her face. Something}
he saw there had a curious effect upon
him. He was suddenly'calm.
"I shall not speak," he said, "now ot*J
at any other time. Come!" ; i*
They went out together and he called
a hansom. From the opposite corner un-^
der the trees a man with his hati
slouched over his eyes stood and glow-'
ered at them.
"I am goinjr to break a covenant."!
he cried. "I cannot keep silence anyj
longer."
know how much of truth thera la in hi*
story."
"If it were all true," he said dogged
ly. "it may still be possible."
"I will think of it." she repeated. **I
cannot say more."
They talked for a .while in somewhat
dreamy fashion, Anna especially being
more silent than usual. At last she
glanced at a little clock In the corner:
of the room and sprang to her feet.
"Heavens, look at the time!" she ax-|
claimed. "It is incredible.. I shall bare-j
ly be in time for the theater. I must
go and dress at once."
He too rose. I
"I will wait for you on the pavement.
if you like." he said, "but I am going
to the Universal with you. Your maid
would not be of the least protection." â
"But your dinner!" she protested.
"You will be so late."
He laughed.
"You cannot seriously believe.** ha
said, "that at the present moment I
care a snap of the fingers whether I
have any dinner or not."
She laughed.
"Well, you certainly did very well at!
tea," she remarked. "If you really are I
going to wait, make yourself as com
fortable as you can. There are cigar
ettes and magazines in the corner
there."
Anna disappeared, but Ennison did
not trouble either the cigarettes or the
magazines. He sat back in an easy:
chair with- a hand upon each of hla el-J
bows and looked steadfastly into the
fire.
People spoke of him everywhere as a
young man of great promise, a politi
cian by instinct, a keen and careful
judge of character. Yet he was in a
state of hopeless bewilderment. He
was absolutely unable to focus hi3
ideas. The girl who had just left the
room was as great a mystery to him
now as on the afternoon when he had
met her in Piccadilly and taken her
to tea. And behindâ there was Paris,]

riea which made his cheeks burn!
and his heart beat quickly* as he satj

was impossible.
She came in while he was still in the
throes, conviction buttling: with com
mon sense, his own apprehension. Ha
rose at once to his feet and turned a!
white face upon her.
He hesitated, and ? glanced toward
her companion. He saw now that it
was merely a boy. .
"This is Mr. Sydney *Courtlawâ -Mr.
Ennison," she said. "You are coming
In, arpn't you, Sydney?"
"If I may," he answered. "Your
coffee is too good to refuse."
She led the way," talking all the
time to Ennison. ,
"Do you know, I have been won
dering what had become of you," she
said. "I had those beautiful roses
from you on my, first night, and a
tiny little note, but no address. I did
not even know where to write and
thank you." \,
"I have been abroad."- he said. "The
life of a private secretary is positively
one of slavery. I had to go at a mo
ment's notice."
"I am glad. that you have a reason
able -excuse for not having been to
sea me," she said, eood-humoredly.
"Mr. Ennison," she exclaimed, "Is
that really you?"
There was no sign of embarrassment
In her manner. -, She held \ out f her
hand frankly. She seemed honestly
glad to see him. > .
"How odd that I should almost
spring into your arms Just on my
doorstep!"- she remarked â¢ gayly. "Are
you in a hurry ? Will you come in
and have some coffee?"
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALI1
"Then you had better- ring the bell,"
she declared, laughing. "The walk has
given me an appetite, and I do not feel
like waiting* 1 till * 5 o'clock. I wonder
why on ' ear th . the curtains are drawn.
It is quite light yet, and I want to have
one more look at that i angry- red sun.
Would you mind drawing them back?/'
"I said some she re
marked, throwing open her warm coat
and taking off her gloves, "but '.I cer-.
tainly did not mean to-day."
"I met you accidentally," he remind
ed her. "Our ways happen .to He to
gether." .
, ."And our destinations also, it seems,"
she added, smiling.
"You asked me : in' to tea," he " pro
tested.
'.'In self-defense Ihad to," she an
swered. "It is" a delightful day for
walking, but a great deal ; too cold to
be standing on the pavement."
"Of course," he said, reaching out his
hand tentatively for his hat, : "I could
go away even now. Your reputation for
hospitality would remain, under a cloud
though, for tea was; distinctly men
tioned."
"This Is Not^the End."
CHAPTER XXm.
"Please make, yourselves comfortable
while I see to the coffee." -
It was a tiny little room, daintily
furnished, individual in its quaint col
oring, and the masses of- perfumed
flowers set in strange and unexpected
places. A great bowl of scarlet car
nations gleamed from a dark corner,
set against the -background of a deep
brown wall. A jar of pink roses upon
a tiny table seemed to gain an extra
delicacy of color from the somber
curtains behind. Anna, who had
thrown aside her sealskin coat, wore
a tight-fitting walking dress of some
dark shade. He leaned back in a low
chair and watched her graceful moVe
ments, the : play of her white hands
as she bent over some wonderful ma
chine. . A r woman Indeed this to love
and be loved, beautiful, graceful, gay.
A dreamy sense of content crept over
him. VThe ambitions of his life, and
they were many, seemed to lie far
a way,, broken' up dreams in some out
side world - where * the way . was rough'
and the sky always gray. v ' A little
table: covered '.with a; damask cloth
was dragged out. . There , were -cakes
and sandwichesâ for - Ennison a sort
of Â¦: Elysian ',. feast, - long * to : be remem
bered. They talked > lightly-: and
smoked cigarettes- till Anna,. with< a
little : laugh, threw .open the window
and let in the cool air. â
â¢-": Ennison .. stood - ;by . â¢-; her side.
They, looked - out over the city,
had told him that It was true. Anna
was married. - After all, she was a
consummate actress. Her recent atti
tude toward him was undoubtedly a
pose. His long struggle with himself,
his avoidance . of her were quite un
necessary. There was no longer* any
risk in association with her. His
pulses -beat fast as he walked, his feet
fell lightly upon the pavement. He
slackened his pace as he reached the
flat. The windows were still darkened
âperhaps she was. not home yet. He
lit, a cigarette and/ loitered about. It
was absurd to hope that he might see
her to-night, yet it was ; pleasant to
linger there, even though the night
was sharp with an early frost, and to
remember that at any moment he
might see her. He laughed
once or twice at himself as he paced
backward and forward. He felt like
a boy again, the taste for adventure
v/as keen upon his palate, the whole
undiscovered world- of .rhythmical
things, of love and poetry^ and pas
sion, seemed again to hijn a real and
actual place, and he himself \ an ad
venturer upon the threshold.
. Then â¢ a hansom drove up, and his'
heart gave a great leap. She stepped
to the pavement almost before ; him,
and. his blood turned: almost ,, to ice ;
as he saw .- that . she .: was /not * alone.
A young man turned to pay. the cab
man. Then she saw him.
the moment. The cultivated lndlffer
j ence which was part of the armor of
his little world fell away from him. He
leaned forward, and looked into the
eyes of the woman he loved, and it
seemed to him that she sans: back to
him with a sudden note of something
like passion breaking here and there
through the gay mocking words
which flowed with such effortless and
seductive music from. her lips.
Neither of them joined in the ap
plause which followed upon her exit.
They were both conscious, however,
that something had intervened be
tween them. Their conversation be
came stilted.* A spot of color, bright
er than any rouge, burned on her
cheeks.
"She is marvelously clever," he said.
"She appears. to be very popular
here," she remarked.
"You too sing?" he asked.
"I have given it up," she answered.
"One genius In the family is enough.
Don't j'ou think so?"
Â¦*â¢ "I suppose," he said, thoughtfully,
"you heard what happened here the
other night?"
"I read about It In the paper.**
He fidgeted with his programme.
"The man must have been mad," he
continued. - "Declared he was her hus
band, you know, and wanted the mag
istrate to look at his marriage certifi
cate*"
"Yes,"' she answered, looking away.
"Some afternoon."

"Oh, I might," he answered, "have
gone further stllL I might have told

"HÂ«s my sister been unkind to you?"

Montague Hill Sees Light at Last.
At exactly ten minutes past ten An
nabel rang the bell of. her sister's flat.
There was no response. She rang again
with the same result. Then, as she
was in the act of turning reluctantly
away, she noticed a thin crack be
tween the door and the frame. She
pushed the former and It opened. The
latch had not fully caught.
The flat was apparently empty. An
nabel turned on the electric light and
made her way into the sitting-room.
There was a coffee equipage on the
table and some sandwiches and the
fire had been recently made up. An
nabel seated herself in an easy chair
and determined to wait for her sister's
return.
The clock struck, half -past ten. The
loneliness of the . place somewhat de
pressed her. She, took up a book and
threw it down again. Then she ex
amined with some curiosity some
knickknacks upon a small round table
by her. side. Among them" was a re
volver. She handled It half Tearfully,
London I went to live in the cheap
est place I could find. I set myself
to find employment. I offered myself
as a clerk, as a milliner, as a shop
girl. I would even have taken a place
as a waitress in a tea shop. I walked
London till the soles of my boots were
worn throuflrh. and my toes were blis
tered. I ate only enough to keep body
and soul together."
"There was no need for such hero
ism," Annabel said coldly. "You had
only to ask "
"Do you think," Anna interrupted,
with a note of passion trembling also
in her tone, "that I would have taken
alms from Sir John, the man to whom
I had lied for your sake. It was not
possible. I went at last when I had
barely a shilling In my purse to a
dramatic agent. By chance I went to
one who had known you In Paris."
"Well!"
"He greeted me effusively. He of
fered me at once an engagement, r
told him that I was not 'Alcide.'. He
only laughed. He had seen the an*
houncement of your marriage in the
papers, and he imagined that I sim
ply wanted to remain 'unknown be
cause of your husband's, purltanlsm.
I sang to him, and he was satisfied.
I did not appear, I have never an
nounced myself as 'Alclde.' It was the
Press who forced the identity upon
me," '. -.-Â¦â¢Â¦:' /..," â¢ V .. '
"They- were, my 'posters,** Annabel
said. "The ones Cariolus did for me."
"ThV posters at least,"' Anna an
swered quietly, ."I have some claim
to. You know very well that you took
from my easel David Courtlaw*s study
of me and ;sent It to Cariolus. You
denied It at the timeâ but unfortuÂ«
"to get rid verr easily of Mr. Monta
gue Hill. You are a great deal more
like what I was a few months ago
than I am now." - . .
Anna laughed softly.
I "You propose then," she remarked,
"that I shall still be saddled with a
pseudo husband. I think not, Anna
bel. You are welcome to proclaim
yourself 'Alclde' if you will. I would
even \ make over my engagement to
you, if Mr. Earles would permit. But
I should certainlv want to be rid of
Mr. Montague Hill and I do not; think
that j under those' circumstances I
should be long about it." v
.Annabel sank suddenly into a chair.
Her knees were trembling, her whole
frame was shaken with sobs.' :.
"Anna," she moaned, "I am a Jeal
ous, ungrateful woman. But oh, how
weary I am! I know. If onlyâ Anna,
tell me," she broke off suddenly.' "how
did you get to know Mr. Ennison?"
"He spoke to me, thinking that I was
you," Anna answered. VI liked him,
and never undeceived him." !
"And he cat at ray table," Annabel
said bitterly, "and yet he did not know
me." .;.;.Â¦; : .:Â¦;--.?;Â¦
Anna glanced up.
"You must -remember," she said,
"that you yourself are responsible for
your, altered looks."
"For the others,"/Annabel said tear
fully, "that \ is well enough, . But for
him"â â z :< \-:- 1 Â¦<;'.'*Â¦Â¦ *"Â¦Â¦ Â¦ ! â¢
>':'â¢} Something in her sister's tone star
tled Anna. She Â¦ looked'- at her for a
moment i fixedly.^ When' she* tried to
speak she found It* difficult.. j Her voice
seemed to come from a long way off.
' 'What do you mean, Annabel ? ; You
that I have ever failed in doing eo."
"You are at least aware," he said.
"that* you have on several recent oc
casions acted In direct opposition to
my wishes."
"For example?"
"Your dyed hair. I was perfectly
satisfied with your appearance. I con
sider even now that the present color
is far less becoming. Then you have
altered not only that, but your man
ner of dressing it. You have darkened
your eyebrows, you have even changed
your style o-f dress. You have shown
an almost feverish anxiety to eliminate
from your personal appearance all
that reminded me of youâ when we
first met."
"Well," she said, "has there not been
some reason for this? The likeness to
Annabel could scarcely have escaped
remark. You forget that every one
is going tu the 'Universal' to sea
her."
He frowned heavily.
"I wish that I could forget it," he
said. "Fortunately I believe that the
relationship is not generally known. I
trust that no unpleasant rumors will
be circulated before the election, at any
rate."
Annabel yawned.
"They might do you good," she re
marked. "Alcide is very popular."
Sir John turned toward the door.
"It does not appear to me," he said,
stiffly, "to be an affair for jests."
Annabel laughed derisively and took
up her book. She heard her husband's
heavy tread descending the stairs and
the wheels of his carriage as he drove
off. Then she threw the volume away
with a little impatient exclamation.
She rose from her chair and began
walking up and down the room rest
lessly. Every now and then she fin
gered an ornament, moved a piece of
furniture, or rearranged some draper
ies. Once she stopped in front of a
mirror and looked at herself thought
fully.
"I am getting plain," she said, with
a little shudder. "This life is killing
me! Oh. it is dull, dull, dull!"
Suddenly an idea seemed to strike
her. She went to her room and changed
the loose morning gown In which she
had lunched for a dark walking dress.
A few minutes later she left the house
on foot and taking a hansom at the
earner of the Square, drove to Anna's
flat.
Anna was having tea by herself
when she entered. She rose at once
with a little exclamation, half of sur
prise, half of pleasure.
"My dear Annabel," she said, "this
is delightful, but I thought that it was
forbidden."
"It is," Annabel answered shortly.
"But I wanted to see you."
Anna wheeled an easy chair to the
fire.
"You will have pome tea?" she asked.
Annabel ignored both the chair and
the invitation. She was looking about
her, her face was dark with anger. The
little room was fragrant with flowers,
Anna herself bright, and with all the
evidences of well being. Annabel was
conscious then of the slow anger which
had been burning within her since the
night of her visit to the Universal.
Her voice trembled with suppressed
passion.
"I have come for an explanation,"
she said. "You are an impostor. How
dare you use my name and sing my
scngs?"
Anna looked at her sister in blank
amazement.
"Annabel!" she exclaimed. "Why,
what is the matter with you? What
do you mean?" -
Annabel laughed scornfully.
"Oh, you know," she said. "Don't
be a hypocrite. You are not 'Alcide.'
You have no right to call yourself
â¢Alcide.' You used to declare that you
hated the name. You used to beg me
for hours at a. time to give it all up,
never to go near the 'Embassador's'
again. And yet the moment I am
safely out 1 of the way you are content
to dress yourself in my rags, to go and
get yourself popular and admired and
successful, all on my reputation."
"Annabel! Annabel!"
Annabel stamped her foot. Her
tone was hoarse with passion.
"Oh, you can act!" she cried. "You
can look as Innocent and shocked as
ycu please. I want to know who sent
you those."
She pointed with shaking finger to
a great bunch of dark red carnations,
thrust carelessly into a deep china
bowl, to which the card was still at
tacked. Anna followed her finger and
looked back into her sister's face.
"They were sent tome by Mr. Nigel
Ennison, Annabel. How on earth does
it concern you?"
Annabel laughed hardly.
; "Concern me!" she repeated fierce
ly. "You are not content then with
stealing from me my name. You would
steal from me then the only man I
ever cared a snap of the fingers about.
They are not your flowers. They are
mine! They were sent to 'Alcide,' not
to you."
Anna rose to her feet. At last she
was roused. . Her cheeks were flushed
and her eyes bright.
"Annabel.", she said, "you are my
sister, or I would bid you take the
flowers if you care for them and leave
the room. But behind these things
which you have said to me there must
be others of which I know nothing.
You speak as one Injured â as though
I had been the one to take your name
â as .though you had been the one
to make sacrifices. In your heart you
know very well that this !s absurd.
It is you who took my name, not . I
yours. It is I who took. the burden
glancing Into his face, "you too look
tired. You poor" man. what have you
been doing to yourself?"
"Nothing except traveling all night,"
he answered. "I am Just back from
Paris. I am bothered. I have come
to you for sympathy, perhaps f jr
help."
"You may be sure of the one," she
murmured. "The other, too, If it is
within my power."
"It is within yours â if anybody's,"
he answered. "It Is about your sister,
Lady Ferringhall."
Annabel gave a little g'asp. The color
slowly left her cheeks, the lines of her
mouth hardened. The change in her
face, was not a pleasant one.
"About \my sister," she repeated
slowly.
Her, tone should have warned him,
but he was too much in earnest to re
gard it.
"Yes. You remember that you saw us
at the Savoy a few evenings ago?"
"Yes."
"And you knew, of course, that we
were old friends?"
"Indeed!"
"Lady Ferringhall, I love your sis
ter."
"You what?" she repeated Incredu
lously.
"I love your sister."
Lady Ferringhall sat with half-closed
eyes and clenched teeth. Brute! Fool!
To have come to her on such an errand.
She felt a hysterical desire to strike
him, to burst out crying, to blurt out
the whole miserable truth. The effort
to maintain her self-control was almost
superhuman.
"Butâ your people!" she gasped.
"Surely Lady Ennison would object,
even if it were possible. And the Duke
too â I heard him Bay that a married
secretary would "be worse than useless
to him." '
. "The difficulties on niy own side I can
deal with," he answered. "I am not de
pendent upon any one. I have plenty
of money, and the Duke will not be In
the next Cabinet. My trouble is with
your sister."
Lady Ferringhall was conscious of
some relief. \
"She has refused to listen to you?"
"She has behaved In a most extraor
dinary manner," he answered. "We
partedâ that night the best of friends.
She knew that I cared for her; she
had admitted that she cared for me. I
suppose I was a little idiotic â I don't
think we either of us mentioned the
future, but It was arranged that I
should go the next afternoon and have
tea with her. When I went I was re
fused admittance. I have since received
a most extraordinary letter from her.
She offers me no explanation, permits
me absolutely no hope. She simply re
fuses to gee or hear from me again.
I went to the theater that night. I
waited for her at the back. She saw
me, and, Lady Ferringhall, I shall
never forget her look as long as I live.
It was horrible. She looked at me as
though I were some unclean thing, as
though my soul \ were weighted with
every sin in the calendar. I could not
have spoken to her.. It took my breath
away. By the time I had recovered my
self she had gone. My- letters are re
turned unopened; her maid win not
even allow me to cross the doorstep."
"The explanation seems to me to be
reasonably simple." Annabel said cold
ly. "You seem to forget that my sister
Is â married." â¢
"If she is," hÂ« answered, "I am con
vinced that there are circumstances in
connection with that marriage which
would make a divorce easy." â¢-"
"You would marry a divorcee?" she
asked. . -. > .
"I would marry your sister anyhow,
Amder any circumstances," he answered.
She looked at him curiously.
"I want to ask you a question," she
said abruptly. "This wonderful affec
tion of yours for my sister, does it data
from vour first meeting with her in
Paris?"
He hesitated.
"I admired your sister In Paris." he
answered, "but I do not believe that I
regarded her now as altogether the
same person. Something has happened
to change her marvelously, either that,
or she willfully deceived me and every
one else in those days as to . her real
self. She was a much lighter and more
frivolous person, very charming and
companionable â but with a difference â
a great difference. I wonder whether
you would mind, Lady Ferringhall."
he went on, with a sudden glance at
her, "if I tell you that you yourself
â¢remind me a great deal more 'of what
she was like then, except of course that
your complexion and coloring are alto
gether different." .
"I Cam- highly â¢ flattered," she re
marked, with subtle Irony.
"Will you help me?" he asked.
"What. can I; do?"
"Go and see her. Find out what I
have done or failed to do. Get: me an
interview with her."
' "Really," she said, with a hard little
laugh, "you must regard me as a very
good-natured person."
"You are," he. answered uncon
sciously. I am i sure that you are. I
want her to tell, me the whole truth
about this extraordinary marriage. We
will find some way out of Jt"
"You think that you .. can do that ?"
/ "1 am sure of it,V.he answered, con
fidently. "Those things are arranged
more easily Â¦ in any other country than

An Old Fool.
Lady Ferringhall made room for him
on the sofa by her side. She was
wearing a becoming tea gown, and it
was quite certain that Sir John would
not be home for several hours at least.
"I am delighted to see you, Mr^ En
nison," she said,- letting her fingers
rest in his. "Do come and cheer me
up. I am bored to distraction."
He took a seat by her side. He -was

1 always thought that your name was
Annabel and hers Anna."
"Many other people." Fhe remarked,

"Again." he said. "I am going to be

"She has changed a good deal," Anna
admitted.
"There is some mystery about you

earneFtness. "No. don't interrupt me.
Why may I not be your friend? Some
how" or other I feel that you have been
S driven into a false position. You repre-
FPnt to me an enigma, the solution of

that I have set my-"' to solve it. To

She seemed unmoved, but she did not
lock at him.
"To Paris'. But why? What do you
hope to discover there?"
"I do not know," he answered, "but
I am going to see David Courtlaw."
ThÂ«n Fhe looked up at him with
frightened eyes.
"Divid Courtlaw!" 6he repeated.
"What hns he to do with it?"
"H<> was your sister's master â her

'"I foibid It!" Fhe Faid firmly.

"It Is for your good â your good only

"Th'-n l.'t me be the judge of what is

He was silent. The tinkling bell of a

room with curious distinctness. He felt

"No." the exclaimed. "You must not.
It is impossible."
His arms were around her. He only
laughed his defiance.
"I will make it possible," he cried.
"I will make all things possible."
Anna was bewildered. She did not
know herself. Only she was conscious
of an unfamiliar and wonderful emo
tion. She gave her lips to his without
resistance. All her protests seemed
stifled before Fhe could .find words to
utter them. With a little sigh of happi
ness Fhe accepted this new thing.
CHAPTER XXV.
Her Sister's Secret.
"I think," Lady Ferringhall said,
"that you are talking very foolishly. I
was quite ae much annoyed as you
were to see Mr. Ennison with my sister
last night. But apart from that, you
have no particular objection to him,
1 suppose?"
"The occurrence of last night Is quite
sufficient in itself." Sir John answered,
"to make me wish to discontinue Mr.
Ennlson's acquaintance. I should
think. Anna, that your own sense â erâ
of propriety would enable you to see
this. It is not possible for us to be on
friendly terms with a young man who
has been seen in a public place, having
supper alone with your sister after
midnight. The fact Itself is regrettable
enoughâ regrettable. I fear, is quite an
Inadequate word. To receive him here
afterward would be most repugnant
to me."
"He probably does not know of the
relationship." Annabel remarked.
"I imagine." F,ir John said, "that your
sister would acquaint him with It. In
any rate, ho Is liable to discover it at
any time. My own impression is that
b r a!rÂ«-ad: f knows."
â¢â¢V.'hv do you think so?*' she asked.
"I noticed him call her attention to
us as we passed down the room," he
answered. "Of course, he may merely
have been telii:;s her who we were, but
I think It improbable."
"Apart from the fact of his acquaint
ance with Annaâ Annabel." Lady Fer
rlngball said quickly, "may I ask if
you have any other objection to Mr.
Ennison?"
Sir John hesitated.
"To the young man himself." he an
swered, "no! I simply object to his
calling here two or three times a week
during my absence."
"How absurd!" Annabel declared.
"How could he call except in your ab
sence, ECS you are never at home in the
afternoon? And if I cared to have him
come every day, why shouldn't he? I
find him very amusing and very useful
as well. He brought his mother to call,
and, as you know, the Countess goes
scarcely anywhere. Hers is quite the
most exclusive set In London."
"My feeling in the matter," Sir John
said, "is as I have stated. Further. I
do not care for you to accept social
obligations from Mr. Ennison, or any
other young man."
"You are jealous," she declared con
temptuously.
"If 1 am," he answered, reddening,
"you can scarcely assert that it is
without a cause. You will forgive my
remarking. Anna, that I consider there
is a great change in your manner
toward me and your general deport
ment since our marriage."
Annabel laughed gayly.
"My dear man," she exclaimed,
"wasn't that a foregone conclusion?"
"You treat the matter lightly," he
continued.
"To me it seems serious enough. I
have fulfilled my part of our marriage
contract. Can you wonder that I ex
pect you to fulfill yours?"
"I am not aware," she answered,
nately I have proof. Mr. Co'urtlaw
found the study in Cariolus' . studio."
Annabel laughed hardly.
> "What did it matter?", she cried.
"We are, or rather we were, so much
alike then that the portrait of either
of us would have done for the other.
It saved me the bother of being stud
ied."
"It convinced Mr. Earles that I was
'Alcide,' " Anna remarked quietly.
"We will convince him now ta the
contrary," Annabel answered. .
Anna looked at her, startled, i
"What do you mean?" she asked.
Annabel set her teeth hard, turned
fiercely toward Anna.
"It means thPt I have had enough
of this slavery," she declared. "My
husband and all his friends are fools,
and the life they lead is impos
sible for me. It takes too many years
to climb even a step in the social lad
der. I've had enough of it. I want my
freedom." â¢
"You mean to say," Anna said slow
ly, "that you are going to leave your
husband?" '
"Yes."
"You are willing to give up your po
sition, your beautiful houses, your car
riages and milliner's accounts to come
back to Bohemianism?'.'
"Why not?" Annabel declared, "I am
sick of it. It is dullâ deadly dull."
"And what about this man-Mr;
Montague Hill?"
Annabel put her hand suddenly to
her throat and steadied herself with
the back of a chair. She looked stealth
ily at Anna. ,
"You have succeeded a little too well
in your personation," 8he said bitterly/
or' your misdeeds upon my shoulders
that you might become Lady Ferring
hall. It is I who am 'persecuted by
the man who calls himself your hus
band."
Annabel shivered a little and looked
around her. :
"He does not come here," she ex
claimed quickly. â¢ â¢
"He spends hours of every, day on
the "pavement below," Anna answered
calmly. -â¢ "He has attempted my life,
I dare not even walk out alone. I
have been bearing this â for your sake.
Shall I send him to Sir John?"
Annabel was white to the lips, but
her anger was not yet spent.
"It was your own fault," she ex
claimed. "He would never have found
you out if you had not personated
me."
"On the contrary," Anna whispered
quietly, "we met in a small boarding
house, where I was stopping." . '
"You have not told me yet," Anna
bel said, "how it is that you have
dared to personate me. To call your
self 'Alcide!' Your hair, your ges
tures, your voice, all mine! Oh, how
darr-d you do it?"
"You must not forget," Anna said
calmly, "that it is necessary for me
also â to live. I arrived here with
something: less than five pounds in my
pocket. My reception at West Ken
sington you know of. I was the black
sheep. I was hurried out of the way.
You did not complain then that 1
personated vou â no. nor when Sir
John came to me In Paris, and for
your sako I lied."
"You did not " .
"Wait, Annabel! When I arrived In
only knew Mr. Ennison slightly"
There was a dead silence in the little
room. Anna sat with the face of a
Sphinx â waiting. Annabel thought,
and thought again.
"I knew Mr. Ennison better than I
have ever told you," she said slowly.
"Go on."
"You knowâ in Paris they coupled
my. name with some one'sâ an Eng
lishman's. Nigel Ennison was he."
Anna stood up. Her cheeks were
aflame. Her eyes were lit with smol
dering passion.
"Go on!" she commanded. "Let me
know the truth."
Annabel looked down. It was hard
to meet that gaze.
"Does he never speak to you of â of
old times?" she faltered.
"Don't fence with me," Anna cried
fiercely. "The truth."
Annabel bent over her and whispered
in her sister's ear.
and set it carefully down again. Then
for the first time she was conscious of
an unaccountable and terrifying sensa
tion. She felt that she was not alon<Â».
She was only a' few yards from the
door, but lacked the courage to rise
and fly. Her knees shook, her breath
came fast, sha almost felt the lurid
effect of those tiny patch* s *f rousr
upon her pallor-stricken cheeks. Her
eyes wore dilatedâ fixed in a horrifle-i
stare at the parttr.s in the curtains
which hung before the window.
There was some one there. She had
seen a man's head steal out for a mo
ment and draw ths curtains a little
closer Eve'- now she could trace the
outline of his shape behind the left
hand curtain. She was wholly unable
to conceal her knowledge of hi3 pres
ence A little smothered cry brok^
from her lipsâ the ctirtal: 3 were
thrown aside and a man stepped out.
She was powerless to move from her
chair. All through that brief but
measureless space cf time durlnr;
which won-"-~ kept Mm silent, as fear
did her, she cowered there, a limp
helpless object. Her couraere and her
presence of mind had alike deserted
her. She could neither speak nor move
nor cry out.
"Annabel! God in heaven, it is An
nabel!"
She did not speak. Her Ups parted,
but no word3 came.
"What have you done to yourself?"
he muttered. "You have dyed your hair
and darkened your eyebrows. But you
are Annabel. I should know youâ in
heaven or hell. Who i3 tha other?"
"What other?"
Her voice seemed to com* from a
long way off. Her lira were dry and
cracked. '
"The Annabel who lives here, who
sings every night at tr-Â» 'Universal?'
They call her by your old name. Her
hair and voice and flours are as yours
used to be. Who is she, I say?"
"My sister!" Annabel faltered.
He trembled violently. He seemed to
be laboring under some great excite
ment.
"I am a fool," he said. "All thess
days I have taken her for you. I have
pleaded with her â no wonder that I
have pleaded with her in vain. And
all this time perhap3 you have been
waiting, expecting to hear from me.
Is it so, Annabel?"
"I did not kno'.v." she faltered, "any
thing about you. Why should I?"
"At last," he murmured, "at last I
have found you. I must not let you go
again. Do you know, Annabel, that
you are my wife?"
"No." she moaned, "not that. I
thoughtâ the papers said "
"You thought that I was dead." he
interrupted. "You pushed the wheel
from my hand. You Jumped, and I
think that you left me. Yet you knew
that I was not dead. You came to sea
me In the hospital. You must have re
pented a little, or you would not hava
done that."
"I did not come." she faltered. "It
was my sister Anna. I had left Paris."
He passed his hand wearily over his
forehead.
"That 13 where I got confused," hÂ«
said. "I opened my ryes, and she was
bending over my bedside. Then I
thought, she has repented, all will bn
well. So I made haste and recovered.
I came to London to look for you. and
somehow the figure I saw In my dreams
had got mixed vx> with you. Your sis
ter! Great God. how lik<Â» she is to
what you were!"
Annabel looked around her nervously.
"These are her rooms," efce said.
"Soon she will return."
"The sooner the better," he an
swered. "I must explain to her. An
nabel, I cannot believe 1L I have found
you."
His eyes were burning. He advanced
a step toward her. She held out both
her hands.
"No, no," she cried. "You frighten
me!"
He smiled at her Indulgently.
"But I am your husband," he said.
You have forgotten. I am your hus
band, though as yet your- hand has
scarcely lain in mine.
"It was a mistake," she faltered.
"You told me that your name was
Meysey Hill. I thought that you were
he "
His face darkened.
"I did it for love of you." he said. I
lied, as I would have committed a
murder or done any evil deed sooner
than lose you. What does it matter?
I am not a pauper. Annabel. I can
keep you. You shall have a house at
Balham or Sydenham, and two ser
vants. You shall have the spending of
every penny of my money. Annabel,
tell me that you did not wish me dead.
Tell me that you are not sorry to sea
me again."
Her passion conquered for a moment
her fear.
"But I am sorry, " she exclaimed.
"Our marriage must be annulled. It
was no marriage at all."
"Never!" he exclaimed vehemently.
"You are mine, Annabel, and nothing
shall ever make me give you up."
"But It Is too late," she declared.
"You have no right to hold me to
a bargain which on your sldÂ»
was a He. I consented to become Sirs.
Meysey Hill â never your wife."
"What do you mean by too lataT" ha
demanded.
"There is some one else whom X care
for." j j
He laughed hardly.
"Tell me his name," he said, "and I
promise that he shall never trouble
you. But you." he continued, moving
Imperceptibly a little nearer to her,
"you are mine. The angels in heaven
shall not tear you from me. We leave
this room , together. I shall not part
with you again."
"No," she cried, "I will not. I will
have nothing to do with you. You are
not my husband."
He came toward her â¢with that In his
face which filled her with blind terror.
"You belong to me," he said fiercely;
"the marriage certificate Is in my pock
et. You belong to me, and I havÂ« wait
ed long enough."
He stepped past her to the door and
closed It. Then he turned with a fierce
movement to take her into his arms.
There was a flash and a loud report.
He threw up his hand, reeled for a mo
ment on his feet and collapsed upon the
floor.
"Annabel," he moaned. "You have
killed me. My wifeâ killed me."
With a little crash the pistol fell from
her shaking fingers. She stood looking
down upon him with dilated eyes. Her
faculties seemed for a moment numbed.
She could not realize what she saw.
Surely it was a dream. A moment be
fore he had "been a strong man; she
had been In his power, a poor, helpless
thing. Now he lay there, a doubled-up
mass, with ugly distorted -features and
a dark wet stain dripping slowly onto
the carpet. It could not be she who had
done this. She had never let off a pis
tol in her life. Yet the smoke was curl
ing upward In a faint, innocent looking
cloud to the ceiling. The smell of gun
powder was strong In the room.
It was true. She had killed him. It
was as much accident as anythingâ but
she had killed him. Once before but
that had been different. This tima they
would call it murder.
She listened, listened Intently for sev
eral minutes. People were passing in
the street below. She could hear their
footsteps upon the pavement. A han
som stopped a little way off. She could
hear the bell tinkle as, the horse shook
its head. There was no one stirring In
the flats. He himself had deadened the
sound by closing the door. She moved
a little nearer to him. .
It was horrible, but she must do It.
She sank ur>on her knees and unbot
toned his coat. It was there in the
breast pocket, stiff and legaf looking.
She drew It out with shaking: fingers.
There was a great splash of blood upon
It; her hand was all wet and sticky. A
deadly sickness cams otw h?r, ths
"It suited you," he continued, "to
make yourself a very charming com
panion to me. You were always
bright and cheerful, and any little ex
pedition which I planned you seemed to
enter into and enjoy. I myself. I fear,
am a somewhat .'dull person. For that
reason perhaps you were more than or
dinarily attracted to me. We were mar
ried, and you yourself, shall be the
judge whether you have not been since
then a .changed woman. You may
say that I am a depressing person to
live with. You see very little more of
me now than during the few weeks
before we were married, and you cer
tainly did not appear to find me such
then."
"Dear me," Annabel exclaimed.
"Thia Is a perfect indictment. You
combat my excuses before I make
them. I shall be crushed flat."
"I think you can scarcely fall to
recognize the truth of what I say,"
Sir John declared. "You complained
of our being able to get away for only
a week, of my house at Hampstead, of
my friends. I have let you choose
your own residence, you are here to
make such friends as your position
*Â»ntitles_you to. I have not deceived
you on~bne single point. On the con
trary, I have done far more than I
ever promised. Am I unreasonable,
therefore, if I look to you for some
better evidence â of your apprecia
tion?" ,
A spark or real sympathy â or per
haps it was remorse â touched Anna
bel. She rose to her feet and bending
lightly over his chair, kissed him on
the' lips.
"You poor old thing,** she exclaim
ed. "I believe you're quite right. I'm
not half so sweet as I ought to be."
Sir John was gratified. He ap
peared ridiculously pleased. He re
tained hold of her fingers.
"That is very charming of you.
dear," he said. "You know what I
heard a man call me In the club the
other day when he heard that I had
married some one so' verr much
younger â an old fool â that was It.
Lately I think the phrase has haunted
me. There may be a little truth In It,
Anna, but I don't want it thrust home
too hard."
"How idiotic!" she laughed. "Be
tween ourselves I think â yes, I think
that you would have been an old fool
If you hadn't married me."
Sir John smiled like a young man.
"I quite agree with you, my dear,"
he said.
Sir John leaned forward In his chair.
"It is an ungracious task," he said,
"to refer to the change in your life
which I have been able to bring about,
but you force me to remind you of
certain things. I found you in Paris
absolutely poverty stricken, and in real
or apparent distress concerning the
misbehavior of your sister. Forgive
me, Anna, but I see no cr.use for
mirth." â
The smile faded from her lips.
"I agree with you." she said. "Go
on."
"I am afraid I do," she admitted.
"I hope." he said, "that you will not
be dull 1 this evening. This electioneer
ing is becoming wearisome, but it is a
necessity." .
"Thankâ you," she said. "I shall not
mind a quiet evening at all. If I am
dull I shall go round and see Sylvia
Mannering."
"Be sure that you take a carriage
and your maid," he said. "I wish that
I could ask you to come with me. I
am afraid, however, that it will be a
rather rough meeting."
She yawned.
"I. wish," she said, "that politics was
not so deadly dull."
"I am sorry," he answered quietly,
"that vou find it so. I trust, how
ever, you .will remember that I shall
expect you to give me some of your
time next week."
"What a bore!" she answered, ab
stractedly.
Sir John frowne-L He looked across
at his wife in disapproval.
- "It seems to me, Anna," he said,
"that lately you find most things a
bore."
She leaned back among the cushions
of her chair. She was very pale, but
she reminded him more at that min
ute than at any time of "Alcide as ne
had first known her.
"I wonder," she said, "how much you
care." .
"I care as a man cares only <"*Â£* in
his life," he answered promptly, "when
it comes there Is no mistaking, it.
"Did it comeâ in Paris?" i;-,W
"I do not know," he answered. I
do not think so. '.Vhat does It mat
ter? It Is here, and It here to stay.
Do help me, Lady Ferringhall. lou
need not be afraid. No trouble will
ever come to your sister through me.
If this idiotic marriage is binding then
I will be her friend. But I have pow
erful friends. I only want to know
the truth and I will move heaven ana
earth to have it set aside."
"The truth," she murmured, with her
eyes fixed upon him. "Well "
She stopped short. He looked at her
In some embarrassment.
- "Forgive me," he said, "but t want
to hear it from your sister. It is her
duty to tell me, and I would not have
her think that I had been trying to
work upon . yc-ur sympathies to learn
her secrets."
She was silent,
"You will bo and see her." he begged.
"Yes, I will go," she promised, with
a queer little smile. "It is against my
husband's orders, and I am not sure
that my sister will be particularly glad
to see me. But I will go."
"I shall always be grateful to you.*
he declared.
"Don't be too sure of that." she an
swered enigmatically.
; She looked at herself In the glass,
loris and earnestly.'
"Blind fool!" she exclaimed under
her breath. "Why cannot he guess th<Â»
truth? I have done my hair in the old
way and left off the rouge. Yet he
.hasn't the faintest idea."
Sir John came home from a board
meeting and she gave him some tea.
It chanced that there were no other
callers. He looked at her once or twice
curiously.
"Is it my fancy, Anna?" he asked,
"or have you done yotir hair different
ly?"
She laughed bitterly. .
"It is pleasant to have some one no
tice 'these things." she declared. "You
were complaining the other day, were
you not, that I had changed so much?
For your private benefit, and for this
afternoon only, I have reverted to the
old style. I can't alter the color, but
you must take that for granted."
Sir John rose solemnly from his
chair, and, -joining over to her side,
stooped and kissed her.
She accepted his embrace passively.
He returned to his seat.
THE- -SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU."I have put the onyx buttons In the
single-breasted waistcoat, sir," he re
marked, before leaving the room. "I
caw Mr. Hamilton to-day, outfitter,
sir, at Poole's, and he advised me to
put the double-breasted ones away for
the moment. I wish you good night,
sir."
Ennison roused himself with an ef
fort, took a long drink from his whisky
and soda and lit a cigarette.
"What a fool I am!" he muttered,
standing up on the hearthrug and
leaning his elbows upon the broad
mantelpiece. "And yet I wonder
whether the world ever held such an
other enigma of her sex. Paris looms
behindâ a tragedy of strange recollec
tions â here she emerges Phenix-llke,
subtly developed, a llawless woman,
beautiful, self-reliant, witty, a woman
with the strange gift of making all
others beside her seem plain or vul
gar. And thenâ this sudden thrust.
God only knows what I have done, or
left undone. Something unpardonable
is laid to ray charge. Only last night
she saw me, and there was horror in
her eyes. I have written, called â
of what avail la ans-thingâ against that
look. What the devil is the mat
ter, Dunster?"
"I beg your pardon, sir," the man
answered, "there is a lady here to see
you."
Ennison turned round sharply.
"A lady, Dunster! "Who 13 it?"
Etill in her hand. She met the keen
gray eyes of u clean shaven man be
tween 40 and 50, quietly dressed in
professional attire. Before he even
glanced ut the man on the floor h-i
stepped over to her sidi and took the
poker from her.
"Forgive me, madame," he said
stiffly, "but in such a case as this it is
better that nothing in the room should
be disturbed until the arrival of the
police. You have been burning paper,
I pee." :: :i ,.i -'.
"Are you a detective or a doctor?"
she a.Â«ked calmly. "Do you need me
to remind you that your patient is
bleeding td death?"
He dropped on his knees by" the
man's side and made a hurried ex
amination.
"Who lied this scarf here?" he ask
ed, looking up.
"I did," Anna answered. "I hope
thut it has done no harm."
"He would have been dead before
now without it," the doctor answered
, shortly. "Get me some brandy and my
bag."
It was nearly half an hour before
they dared ask him the question.
"Will he live?"
The doctor shook his head.
"It is very doubtful." he said. "You
must send for the police at once, you
know. You. sir," he added, turning to
Brendon, "had better take my card
round to the police station In Werner
street and ask that Detective Dorling
be sent round here at once on urgent
b^iFineEF."
"Is it necessary to send for the po
lice?" Anna asked.
"Absolutely." the doctor answered,
."and the sooner the better. This is a
case either of suicide or murder. The
police are concerned in it in either
event."
- "Please go then, Mr. Brendon."
Anna said. "You will come back,
He nodded cheerfully.
"Of course I will," he answered.
The doctor and Anna Â¦were left
alone. Every moment or two he bent
over his patient. He seemed to avoid
meeting Anna's eyes as much as pos
sible.
"Does he live here?" he asked pres
ently. ,
"No."
"Far away?"
"I have no idea," Anna answered.
"Who is the tenant of these rooms?"
he inquired.
"I am."
"You will have no objection to his
remaining here?" he asked. "A move
of any sort would certainly be fatal." >
"Of course not." Anna said. "Had
he better have a nurse? I will be re
sponsible for anything of that sort."
"If he lives through the next hour."
the doctor said, "I will send some one.
Do you know any of his friends? Is
there any one for whom we ought to
send?"
"I know very little of him beyond his
name," Anna answered. "I know noth
ing whatever of his friends or his
home. He used to live in a boarding
house in Russell square. That Is where
I first knew him."
The doctor looked at her thoughtful
ly. Perhaps for the first time he real
ized that Anna wp? by no means an or
dinary person. His was dis
tinctly of a different order of, life. It
was possible th^ V's first impressions
had not been correct.
"Your name, I believe. Is "
"Pellissier." Anna answered.
"Allow me," the doctor said, "to give
you a ward of advice. Miss Pellissier.
A detective will be here in a few min
utes to make inquiries Into this affair.
You may have something to conceal,
you may not. Tell the whole truth. It
always comes out sooner or later.
Don't try to shield anj'body or hide
anything. It is bad policy."
Anna smiled vry faintly.
"I thank you for your advice," she
said. "I can assure you that it was
quite unnecessary. I know less about
this affair perhaps than you suppose.
What I do know I shall have no hesi
tation in telling any one who has the
right to ask."
"Just eo." the doctor remarked drily.
"And if I were you I would- keep away
from the fire."
Brendon reappeared, followed by a
tall, thin man with a stubbly brown
moustache ard restless gray eyes. The
doctor nodded to him curtly.
"Good evening. Dorling." he said.
"Before you do anything else I should
advise you to secure those charred frag
ments of paper from the grate. I know
nothing about this affair, but some one
has been burning documents."
The detective went down on his hands
and knees. With delicate touch he res
cue'" all that was possible of them, and
made a careful little parcel. Then he
stepped briskly to his feet and bent
over the wounded man.
"Fhot through the lungs," he re-
m The*doctor nodded.
"Bad hemorrhage." he said. "I am
going to fetch some things that will be
wa- ed If he pulls through the next
hour. I found him lying like this, the
bleeding partly stopped by this scarf,
else he had been dead by now."
The doctor glanced toward Anna.
Considering his convictions, he felt that
his remark was a generous one. An
na's face, however, was wholly impas
sive.
He took up his hat and went. The
detective rapidly sketched the appear
ance of the room in his notebook and
picked up the pistol from under the
table. Then he turned to Anna.
"Can you give me any Information
as to this affair?" he asked.
"I will tell you all that I know."
Anna said. "My name is Anna Pellis
sier. sometimes called Annabel. I am
engaged to sing every evening at the
'Universal' music hall. This man's
name is Montague Hill. I saw him
first a few months ago at Mrs. White's
boarding-house In Russell Square. He
subjected me there to great annoyance
by claiming me as his wife. As a mat
ter of fact, I had never spoken to him
before In my life. Since then he has
persistently annoyed me. A few nlghta
ago he fired a pistol at me at the 'Uni
versal/ and was bound over to keep
the peace. Ever since then, however,
I have seen him hanging about the
place. I have suspected him of pos
sessing a skeleton key to my apart
ments. To-night I locked up my flat
at 6 o'clock. It was then, I am sure,
empty. I dined with a friend and
went to the 'Universal.* At 11:15
o'clock I returned here with this gen
tleman. Mr. Brendon. As we turned
the corner of the street I noticed that
the electric light was burning in this
room. We stopped for a moment to
watch It, and almost Immediately it
was turned out. We came on here at
once. I found the door locked as
usual, but when we entered this room
e\ erything was as you see. Nothing
has been touched since."
The detective nodded.
; "A very clear statement, madam,"
he said. "From what you saw from
the opposite pavement, then, It is cer-
rest another time."
She smiled faintly.
"The rest," she said, holding tight
ly to his hands, "is the most important
of all. You came to me, you wished
me to speak to Anna. I went to her
rooms to-night. There was no one at
home and I was coming away when I
saw that the door was open. I de
cided to go in and wait. In her sit
ting-room I found Montague Hill. He
had gained admission somehow and
he, too, was waiting for Anna. But
â he was cleverer than any of you.
He knew me, Nigel. 'At last,' he
cried, 'I have found you!" He would
listen to nothing. He swore that I
was his wife and â I shot him. Nigel,
as his arms were closing around me. 1
Shot him, do you hear?"
"Good God!" he exclaimed, looking
at her curiously. "Is this true, Anna
bel? Is he dead?"
She nodded.
"I shot him. I saw the blood come
as he rolled over. I tore the marriage
certificate from his pocket and burnt
it. And then I came here."
"You came â here!" he repeated
vaguely.
"Nigel, Nigel," she cried. "Don't
you understand? It is I whom you
cared for in Paris, not Anna. She Is
a stranger to you. You cannot care for
her. Think of those days in Paris.
Do you remember when we went right
away, Nigel, and forgot everything?
We went down the river past Veraz,
and the larks were singing all over
those deep brown fields and the river
farther on wound Its way like a coil
of silver across the rich meadowland
and along the hillside vineyards. Oh.
the scent of the flowers that day, the
delicious Quiet, the swallows that
dived before us In the river. Nigel!
You have not forgotten. It was the
first day you kissed me, under the
willows, coming Into Veraz. Nigel,
you have not forgotten!"
"No," he said, with a little bitter
smile. "1 have never forgotten."
She suddenly caught hold of his
shoulders and drew him down toward
her.
"Nigel, don't you understand? I
must leave England to-night. I must
go somewhere Into hiding, a long, long â¢
way off. I killed him. Nigel. They
say that It was murder. But If only
you will come I do not care." ... --vt ;Â¦ .
He shook her hand? off almost
roughly. He stood away from her.
She listened with dumb fear in her
eyes. -
"Listen, Annabel." he said hoarsely.
"We played at lovemaking in Paris. It
was very pretty and very dainty while
it lasted, but we played it with our
eyes open and we perfectly understood
the game â both of us. Other things
came. We went our ways. There
was no broken faith â not even any
question of anything of the sort. I
met you here as Lady Ferringhall. We
have played at a little mild lovemak
ing again. It has been, only the sort
of nonsense which passes lightly
enough between half the men and
women In London. You shall know
the truth. I do not love you. I have
never loved you. I call myself a man
of the world, a man of many experi
ences, but I never knew what love
meant â until I met your sister."
"You loveâ Anna?" she exclaimed.
"I do." he answered. "I always shall.
Now if you are ready to go with me, I
too am ready. We will go to Ostend
by the early morning boat and s choose
a hiding place from there. I will marry
you when Sir John gets his divorce, and
I will do all I can to keep you out of
harm. But you had better know the
truth to start with. I will do all this
not because I love you, butâ because
you are Anna's sister."
Annabel rose to her feet.
"You are magnificent," she said, "but
the steel of your truth is a little over
sharpened. It cuts. Will you let your
servant call me a hansom?" she con
tinued, opening the door before he
could reach her side. "I had no idea
that It was so abominably late."
He scarcely saw her face again." She
pulled her veil down, and he knew that
silence was best.
"Where to?" he asked, as the han
som drove up.
"Home, of course," she answered.
**8 Cavendish Square."
CHAPTER XXX. V ;
Annabel Is Warned.
He crossed the floor of the* dingy lit
tle sitting-room i with outstretched
hands.
"You cannot say that you did not ex
pect roe," he answered. "I got Syd
ney's telegram at 10 o'clock, and caught
the 10:20 from the Gare du Nord."
"Served the beast right," Ennison de
clared. "I think I can tell you some
thing which may be very good news
for you presently. But go on."
"Act two," she continued. "Enter
Sir John, very honest, very much In
love with me. I thought that Hill was
dead, but I was frightened and I want
ed to get away from Paris. Sir John
heard gossip about us â about Anna
the recluse, a paragon of virtue, and
Annabel, alias Alcide, a dancer at the
cafes chantants. and concerning whom
there were many stories which were
false, and a fewâ which were, true. Iâ
well, I borrowed Anna's namel**'! made
her my unwilling confederate. Sir
John followed me to London and mar
ried me. To this day he and every one
else thinks that he married Anna.
"Act three. Anna comes to London.
She is poor, and she will take nothins:
from my husband,- the man she had de
ceived for my sake, and he, on his
part, gravely disapproves of her as Al
cide. She tries every way of earning: a
living and fails. Then she goes to a
dramatic agent Curiously enough
nothing will persuade him that she is
not Alcide. He believes that she denies
It simply because owing to my mar
riage with Sir John, whom they call
the 'Puritan Knight, 1 she wants to keep
her identity secret. He forces an en
gagement upon her. She never calls
herself Alcide. It Is the press who finds
her out. She Is the Image of what I
was like and she has a better voice.
Then enter Mr. Hill againâ alive. He
meets Anna and claims her as his wife.
It Is Anna again who stands between
me and ruin."
"I cannot let you go on," Ennison In
terrupted. "I believe that I can give
you great news. Tell me where the fel
low Hill took you for this marriage
ceremony."
â¢It was behind the . Place de Ven
dotne, on the other side from the Ritz."
"I knew It." Ennison exclaimed.
"Cheer up, Annabel. You were never
married at all. That\place was closed
by the police last month. It was a bo
gus affair altogether, kept by Â«ome
blackguard or other of an Englishman.
Everything'was done In the most leeal
and Imposing way, but the whole thins
was a fraud."
"Then I was never married to him
at all?" Annabel said.
"Neverâ but. by Jove, you had a nar
row escape,'! Ennison exclaimed. "An
nabel. I begin to see why you are here.
Think! Had you not better hurry back
before Sir John discovers? You are his
wife right enough. You can tell me the
It came upon him like a flash. Innu
merable little puzzles were instantly
solved. He could only wonder that this
amazing thing had remained so long a
secret to him. He remembered little
whispered speeches of hers, so like the
Annabel of -Paris, so unlike the woman
he loved, a hundred little things should
have told him long ago. Nevertheless It
was overwhelming.
"But your hair," he gasped.
"Dyed!"
"And your figure?"
"One's corsetiere arranges that. My
friend, I am only grieved that you of
all others should have been so deceived.
I have seen you with Anna, and I have
not known whether to be glad or sorry.
I have been in torment all the while
to know whether it was to Anna or to"
Annabel that you were making love so
charmingly. Nigel, do you know that
I have been very jealous?"
He avoided the invitation of her eyes.
He was. Indeed, still in the throes of
his bewilderment. *
"But Sir John?" he exclaimed. "What
made you marry him? What made you
leave Paris without a word to any one?
What made you and your sister ex
change identities?"
"There is one answer to all these
questions, Nigel," she said, with a
nervous little shudder. "It is a hateful
story. Come close to me and let me
hold your hand, dear. I am a little
afraid."
There was a strange look in her face,
the look of a frightened child. Ennison
Beemed to feel already the shadow of
tragedy approaching. He stood by her
side, and he suffered her hands to rest
inibls^:-*.
?â¢' rYou remember the man In Paris who
used to follow me aboutâ Meysey Hill
they called him?"
â¢ He nodded.
"Miserable bounder," he murmured.
"Turned out to be an impostor, too."
"He imposed on me," Annabel con
tinued. "I believed that he was the
great multi-millionaire. He worried
me to marry him. I let him take me
to the English Embassy, and we went
through some sort of a ceremony. I
thought It would be magnificent to
have a great house in Paris and more
money than any other woman. After
ward we started for dejeuner in a mo
tor. On the way he confessed- He was
not Meysey Hill, but an Englishman of
business, and he had only a small in
come. Every one took him for the mil
lionaire, and he had lost his head about
me. Iâ well, I lost my temper. I struck
him across the face, twisted the steer
ing wheel of the motor, sprang out my
self and left him for dead on the road
with the motor on too of him. This is
the first act." Â¦
She fixed her brilliant eyes upon him.
"Suppose you call me by my proper
name," she said quietly. "Call me An
nabel."
He started- back as though he had
been shot.
"Annabel?'' he exclaimed. "That Is
your sister's name."
"No, mine."
v "I cannot pretend that I am glad to
see you, Lady Ferrlnghall,** he said
quietly. "For your own sake let me beg
of you not to stay for a moment. Dun
ster will fetch you a cab. Iâ"
She threw herself Into an easy chair.
She was unusually pale and her eyes
were brilliant. Never had she seemed
to him so much like Anna.
"You needn't be worried," she said
quietly. "The conventions do not mat
ter one little- bit. You will agree with
me when you have heard what I have
to say. For me that is all over and
done with."
"Lady Ferringhall! Anna!" he ex
claimed. , , Â¦ -
Ennison was dismayed.
"For heaven's sake. Dunster, don't
let her out of the carriage, or han
som, or whatever she came in. Say
I'm out, away, anything!"
"I am sorry, sir," the man answered,
"but ehe had sent away her hansom be
fore I answered the bell. She la In the
hall now. I â "
The dcor was flung open. Annabel
entered.
"Forgive my coming in,'* she said to
Ennison. "I heard your voices and the
hall is draughty. What is the matter
with you?"
Dunster had withdrawn discreetly.
Ennison's manner was certainly not
one of a willing host.
The man came a little farther into
the room. .
"Lady Ferringhall, sir."
"Lady Ferringhallâ alone?" Ennison
exclaimed.
"Quite alone, sir."
"I will go," he said. "She must be
warned. She had better escape If
she can."
"Where?" Courtlaw asked quickly.
"In Paris."
Courtlaw seemed about to say some
thing. He changed his mind, however,
and simply motioned to her to proceed.
"Then there was a motor accident
only an hour or so after this ceremony
and Hill was reported to be killed. An-,
nabel believed it, came to England and
married Sir John. Now you can under
stand why I have been obliged to"
"Yes, yes. I understand that." Court
law interrupted. "But about last
night."
"Annabel knew where I lived," Anna
continued slowly. "She has been to
my flat before. I saw her come out
from the flat buildings two minutes be
fore we entered it last night. I picked
up her handkerchief on the floor."
"You mean â you think"
"Hush! I think he was concealed In
my room and Annabel and he met
there. What passed betwen them I
cannot think â I dare not. The pistol
was his own, it Is true, but It was
one which was taken from him when
he forced his way In, upon me before.
Now you can understand why every
minute is a torture to me. It Is not
for myself I fear. But If he speaks â
I fear what he may tell."
"You have been to her?" he asked.
"I dare not," she answered.
"Yes."
"Annabel's reason for wishing to
leave Paris, the real reason she mar
ried Sir John Ferringhall, was because
of a verv foolish thing which she did.
It was â in connection with this man
Hill. He personated over there a mil
lionaire named Meysey Hill, and it
seems that he induced Annabel to go
through some sort of marriage with
him at the embassy."
"You are my friend." she said, "if
any one is. I think that I will tell
you. The man Hill has persecuted ma
for months â ever since I have been
in England. He claimed me for his
wife, and showed to every one a mar
riage certificate. He shot at me at
the Universal and the magistrates
bound him over to keep the peace. I
found him ence in my rooms and I be
lieve that he had a key to my front
door. Last night Mr. Brendon and I
returned from the Universal and found
him lying in my room shot through the
lungs. In the grate were some charred
fragments of a marriage certificate.
We fetched the doctor and the police.
From the first I could see that neither
believed my story. I am suspected of
having shot the man."
"But that Is ridiculous!" he ex
claimed.
She laughed a little bitterly.
"I am under police surveillance,** she
said. "So is Mr. Brendon."
"But there. is not a shadow of evidence
against youi" he objected. "The man
alone could supply any and if he re
covers sufficiently to say anything,
what he would say would exonerate
There was a moment's silence. An
na's face was half turned from him.
but her puzzled expression and the
tone of her monosyllable puzzled him.
He stepped auickly toward her. Her
eyes seemed to be looking backward.
She distinctly shivered as he forced
her to look at him. He was bewild
ered..
"Anna!" he exclaimed hoarsely.
"Look at me. What is it? Good God:"
An unhappy little smile parted her
lips. She clenched her hands together
and leaned forward in her chair, gaz
ing steadily into the flre.
"I think," she said, "that I will tell
you everything. I must tell somebody
â and you would understand."
"I am your friend," he said slowly.
"whatever you may have to tell me.
You can trust me, Anna. You know
that. I will be as silent as the grave."
"Not long ago." she said, "you left
me in anger, partly because of this ex
change of Identities between Annabel
and myself. You said that It wou!d
bring trouble. It has."
She hesitated.
"It is very nice of you." she said
softly.
"Rubbish!" he answered. "I could
not have stayed In Paris and waited
for news. Tell me exactly what has
happened. Even now I do not under
stand. Is the man Hill dead?"
She shook her head.
"He was alive at 4 o'clock this after
noon," she answered, "but the doctors
give little hope of his recovery."
"What is there to be feared?** he
asked her quietly.
"With your permission," he said to
Anna, "I shall arrange a bed for him
â¢where he is. There is scarcely one
chance in a dozen of saving his life,
there would be none at all if he were
moved."
"You can make any arrangements
you like," Anna declared. "I shall
leave the flat to you and go to a
hotel."
"You would perhaps be so good as
to allow one of my men to accompany
you and see you settled," Mr. Dorling
said deferentially. "In the event of
his death we should require you at once
to attend at the inquest."
"I am going to pack my bag," Anna
answered. "In five minutes I shall be
ready."
Mr. Dorling drew the doctor to one
side.
"What* do you think?" he whispered.
"She shot him, of course," the doctor
answered. "It Is qTiite plainâ motive
and everything. One can picture tbjBi
whole scene. The man Is -probably her
husband, a disreputable lot, by ther
look of him. He finds his way here and
waits for her. She returns â with the>
.other fellow. Of course there's a row â
either she or the other fellow shoots
him. You will see what those scraps'
of paper are which they probably took
from him and burned."
"I have a very strong Idea," the
detective said slowly, "that It was a
marriage certificate."
"If you can prove that," the doctor
answered, "it should hang her. You
are not letting her go, are you?"
The detective smiled.
"There is not the slightest object in
arresting her," he said, "unless she
tries to leave London. We can do that
at any moment, and if we leave her
alone she is . far more likely to give
herself away. How about the man?"
"He will die," the doctor answered.
CHAPTER XXIX.
The Steel Edge of the Truth.
The man servant, with bis plain black
clothes and black tie, had entered the
room with a deferential little gesture.,
"You will pardon me, sir," he said
in a subdued tone, "but I think that
you have forgotten to look at your
engagement book. There is Lady Ar
lington's reception to-night, ten till
twelve, and the Hatton House ball,
marked with a cross, sir, important. I
put your clothes out an hour ago."
Nigel Ennison looked up with a little
start.
"All right, Dunster," he said. "I
may go to Hatton House later, but you
needn't wait. I can get into my
clothes."
The man hesitated.
"Can I bring you anythingr sirâ a
whisky and soda, or a liqueur* You'll
excuse me, sir. but you haven't touched
your coffee."
"Bring me a whiskv and soda and a
box of cigarettes," Ennison answered,
"and then leave me alone, there's a
good fellow. I'm a little tired."
The man obeyed his orders noise
lessly.
'The inference is, then," the detec
tive said smoothly, "that this man ob
tained admission to your rooms
by means of a false key. that he
burried some papers here and
shot himself within a few
moments of your return. Either that
or some other person also obtained
admission here and shot him, and that
person is either still upon the premise's
or escaped without your notice."
"I suppose," Anna said, "that those
are reasonable deductions."
The,detective thrust his notebook Into
his pocket.
"I brought a man with me who Is
posted outside," he remarked. "With
ycur permission I should like to search
the remainder of your rooms."
Anna showed him the way.
"Have either of you been out of this
room since you discovered what had
happened?" he asked.
"Mr. Brendon went for the doctor,"
Anna answered. "I have not left this
apartment myself."
Nothing unusual was discovered in
any other part of the flat. While they
were still engaged in looking around
the doctor returned with a nurse and
assistant.
a? keel. . *
"No."
"There Is no one else who hag a key
to your rooms?"
"No one except my maid, who is
in Wiltshire."
The detective turned again to Anna.
"You know of no one likely to have
had a grudge against this man?" he
tain that some person who was able
to move about was in this room o^F
a minute or so before you entered it?"
"That is so," Anna answered.
"You met- no dne upon the stair,
nor saw no one leave the flats?"
"Scr one," Anna answered firmly.
"Then either this man shot himself
or some one else shot him immediate
ly before your arrivalâ or rather if it
was not himself, the person who did it
was in the room, say two minutes, be
fore you arrived.".
"That is so." Anna admitted.
"I will not trouble you with any
questions about the other occupants
of the flats," Mr. Dorling said. "I
shall have to go through the building.
You say that this gentleman was with
you?"
"I was," Brendon answered, "most
providentially."
"You did not notice anything which
may have escaped this lady? You
sa.w no one leave the flats?"
"Xo one," Brendon answered.
"You heard no pistol shot?"
"None." V

the heart of the dying :iames. She held
it down with the poker, looking ner
vously- over her shoulder. Then sne put

Still silence everyhere. She pulled
down her veil and made her way
iÂ«i the door. She turned out the
electric light and sained the hall.
SUU no sound. Her knees almost
sank beneath her us she raised the
latch of the front door and looked out.
There vms no one to be seen. She

Eho tralked for a mile or more reck
lessly, close-veiled, with swift, level
footsteps, though her brain was in a
whirl and a horribie faintnesa all the
time hovered about her. Then she
tailed a hansom and drove home.
"Mies PeilUBler," he said gently, "I
am afraid that some fresh trouble has
eorne to you."
She smiled at him cheerfully.
"Am I dull?" she said. "I am sorry."
"You could never be that," he an
swered, "but you are at least more se
rious than usual."
â¢â¢Perhaps," she said. "I am supersti
tious. This is nay last week at the
Universal, you know. We begin re
hearsing on Monday at the Garrick."
"Surely," he protested, "the change
is all in favor of your own inclinations.
It is your own choice, isn't it?"
â¢â¢Yea. Bat I believe that Mr. Earles
thinks I am a little mad, and between
ourselves 1 am not sure about it my
self. It is easy enough to sins these
little chansons in an original way â it
requires a very different sort of ability
to succeed on the sta^e."
"You have it," he declared confident
ly.
She laurhed altogether in her old
manner.
"I wonder how it is," she exclaimed,
"that my friends have so much more
confidence in me than I have in my
teif."
â¢ They know you better," he declared.
"I na afraid," she answered, "that
GTif'p friends can judge O&Iy of the ex
ternals ard the things which matter,
the thing's inside, are realized only by
oneself â stop."
t?he laid her finger upon his arm- and
they both stood still. They had turned
into the street, on the opposite side or
which were the fiats where Anna lived.
Glancing' idly \ip at her own window
as they had swung round the corner
she had seen a strange thing. The cur
tains which she had left drawn were
open and the electric lights were
turned on. Then, even as they stood
there, the room was plunged into dark
r.ess.
'There is some one in my rooms,"
Anna said.
"I? it your maid?" he asked.
"I have given her two days' holiday,"
Anna answered. "She has gone down
into the countrj'."
"And r.o one els*? â has a key?"
"I believe," she said, "that that man
must have cn*>. I am safe while I am
there, for I have had bolts fitted
everywhere and a pane of glass in the
front door. But I am always afraid
that he may get in while I am away.
Look! Is that some one coming out?"
The front door of the? flats stood open
ar.d through it a woman, slim and
veiled, passed on to the pavement and
turned with swift footstens In the op
posite direction. Anna watched her
v.Sth curious eyes.
"I* it any one you know?" Brendon
asked.
"I am not sure." Anna answered.
"But. of course, she may have come
frcm one of the other flats."
"Perhaps." he said, "you had better
let me have your key, ar.d I will go up
and explore."
"We will go together." she answered.
They crossed the street, and entering
the front door passed up the outside
Ftone steps of the fiat. Anra herself
r per.ed the hall door. They stood for a
moment in the passage and listened.
Silence! Then Anna clutched her com
panion's arm.
"What was that?" she asked sharply.
He had heard nothing. They both
listened Intently. Again silence.
"I thought that I heard a groan,"
Anna whispered.
Ke laughed reassuringly.
"I heard ncthir.e." he declared, "and
my ears are good. Come."
Ke threw open the door of the sit
ting-room and switched on the electric

He turned around to keep Anna out
by force Jf possible, but he was too
late. She was by his side. She too had
'reen. The thin stream of blood on
Â¦which her eyes were fastened with a
nameless horror reached almost to her
feet.
CHAPTER XJCV1IL
A Case for the Police.
After that first horrible moment It
was perhaps Anna who was the more
self-possessed. She dropped on her
knees by his side and gently unbut
toned his waistcoat. Then she looked
\ip at Brendon.
"You must fetch a doctor." she said.
"I do not think that be is quite dead."
"And leave you here alone?" he asked
In a hoarse whisper. "Come with me."
"I am not afraid," she answered.
"Please hurry."
He reeled out of the room. Anna
was afterward astonished at her own
self -possession. She bound a scarf
tightly round the place where the blood
teemed to be comics from. Then she
stood up and looked around the room.
There were no e/ldences of any
struggle, no overturned chairs or dis
arranged furniture. The gTate was full
of the fluttering ashes of burnt paper,
and the easy chair near the flre had
evidently been used. On the floor was
a handkerchief, a little morsel of lace.

found herself trembling.

The American Boy's Life of Theo
dore Roosevelt," by . Edward Strate
raeyer. is an excellent book for the
American boy to read once and then
again. The narrative covers the whole
life of the President from schoolboy to
his present exalted position in a style
well fitted to juvenile comprehension
and appreciation. The author has been
quick to catch the fascinating phases
of Roosevelt's life as hunter, plains
man and rough rider and deals with
the profundities of politics only in such
measure as is necessary. The descrip
tions of battle scenes In Cuba are
well calculated to hold the boyish
fancy.

poems of Shelley, the prefatorlal du
ties are undertaken by Mrs. Alice Mey
nell, the well known English woman
of letters. Though her critical estimate
of the poet is encompassed in a few
hundred words, Mrs. Meynell has hit
off the peculiar quality of the roman
ticist's verse with clear cut- emphasis.
Shelley is not a great poet, according
to her view, since he is not possessed
of the divine fire of poesy which car
ries beyond . the mere flights of Imag
ery and touches realities with miracu
lous touch. But even as a poet of the
second rank Shelley has power which
moves his commentator to this esti
mate on the character of his poetry:
"That character is * exceedingly seri
ous as well as wild; it has the motion
of an Ariel without Ariel's light heart;
it is nothing If not responsible and sad,
and yet what a flight is. hisâ what a
flitting! No one can define the Shelley
quality by any word; but we may take
a word to represent it and call it mag
ical."

William J. Shearer, A.M., Ph.D., Su
perintendent of Schools of Elizabeth,
N. J., and a familiar writer on sub
jects of home influence and home train
ing, has produced a book on "The Man
agement and Training of Children,"
which may be found useful to some
mothers. There are chapters upon the
responsibility of parents, upon sym
pathy between parent and child and
the development of good and bad in
stincts in the youngster. All this is
perfect theoretically without doubt, but
it is not the consensus of opinion that
children can be raised on theory.
Usually the eldest grows up under the
straight rule of principle and all suc
cessive progeny are raised "by experi
ence." A book on the theory of child
training must be used by the young
mother much as a cook bookâsparing
ly; this last statement, however, the
writer disclaims as original, nor will
he stand the responsibility for its ut

nent misrule" of the feudal system.
Indeed, did Anglo-Saxon King Arthur
and hia knights of the table round
represent anything but the feudal
theory? â¢ . :
After allowing us to believe that the
invasion of the Normans was nothing
but a continuation of the earlier In
cursions' of pure Danish stock, the
author continues to trace the warring
influences of Anglo-Saxon and Nor
man ideas through all England's sub
sequent existence. Even after the
testimony of English history, fit Eng-
Ufh literature and of English tradition
fall to show aught but an homogeneous
English people, the writer persists in
seeing everywhere In government a
rampant "Normanism" and a pug
nacious "Anglo-Saxonism." The wars
of Simon de Montfort but clinched the
fetters of the commons or Anglo-
Saxons, the Hundred Years' War was
fought entirely in the interests of the
Normans, the great Civil War was
avowedly a struggle between Anglo-
Saxon and Norman, even the American
Revolution expressed but the final tri
umph of the ancient governmental
scheme of skin-dad Angle and Saxon
over the oppressive tyranny of the
armor-girt follower of William L This
stretching of fact to meet theory is
fantastic if naught else.
In tracing the transplanting of the
Anglo-Saxon idea to America, Mr. Tapp
has to make the most Interesting
hurdling over historical fact in the
whole volume. His statement that the
Puritan belief In "the right to worship
God without any sanction from any
priesthood or ecclesiastical court" was
but a perfect demonstration of the An
glo-Saxon spirit of liberty, does not
take Into account the tale of Roger
Williams and Anne Hutchtnson, who
were denied sanction to pre-xh by this
very magnanimous genius of freedom.
Again, In an attempt to reconcile the
presence In the colonies of . the Vir
ginian cavaliers and the aristocracy of
the Southern plantationsâ Normans
certainlyâ with his dogma of an Anglo-
Saxon outpouring from England to
America, our author gathers these
worthy Revolutionary, fathers under
the generic title of "a few of the privi
leged classes of England who had been
sent over to rule and collect taxes."

ceptable to the pride of some F. F. Vs. .

nificance In the flight of years. Not
the cold perfection of technique that
was Michel Angelo's, nor the delicacy
of line that was Raphael's * is the
charm which makes Titian's canvases
living elements of. to-day's esthetic
appreciation; in his art it is color â
color expressing all the passionate
feeling arid animated action of a mas
ter genius. "He who would be a
painter," said Titian, "needs to know
but three colorsâ white, black and
red â and to have them well in hand."
No one since his time has had the
colors so "well In hand."
Groneau seeks to show in the early
chapters of his work how it was that
the conditions of life and art in Venice
brought to the young Vecellio, Just
taking up his abode In the Adriatic
city, a consuming passion for high
colors. Venice, then in the -height of
its glory, was the constant theater for
gorgeous pageants and glittering spec
tacles. House fronts and cathedrals'
exteriors were crusted with frescoes
and mosaics of rich and harmonious
colors. : The * people reveled In -color
for color's sake. So it was that when
the young painter, fresh from the
pastoral beauties of the lower Tyrol,
came Into the zone of this riotous
chromatic extravagance his soul
caught the tune of things and x his
palette glowed as none has since done.
It was with Giorglone, then dean of
Venetian painters, that Titian worked,
first as pupil and then as Intimate fel
low craftsman. While absorbing from
his master a profoundly spiritual con
ception of portraiture and exemplify
ing It In his early, paintings to ruoh
degree that the works of the respec
tive artists have been confused, Titian
gradually began to forsake the lyrical
mood and to give vein to his penchant
for the dramatic By so doing he put
life Into the conventional set. figures
of religious paintings. Says Groneau:
"Titian passed with rapid strides
the whole range of problems
possible In altar picture; in the As
sunta he Introduced into Venice en
tirely new subject matter; he trans
ported 'The Madonna With Saints' out
of a world of quiet; existence. Into the
rest! ess and changeful conditions of
real ; life; he . set aside the old Ideas of
composition and removed the principal
group ' from the' central line of the pic
ture, and by means . of - his . structure
of. lines Â¦ and his ordered harmony : of
color pervading 1 the whole,: created a
new and dramatically life-like present
ment of the old them*." .
Unlike Raphael, Titian did not come
to the highest' fruition of; his powers
until he ' had reached middle life, but
he was : painting * some of his best'pic
tures at : an age . when most men'; would
be in; their graves, i Thus; it Is that

sound something like this:

Shakespeare students in that it gives
In the first popular edition the original
tcoct of the great dramatist's works,
without amendation or modernizing of
any part.
As Shakespeare specialists know, the
First. Folio is the sole authority for
twenty of the plays and furnishes the
first complete text of two besides. The
appearance before the death of the
poet of the earlier quarto Issues was
both unauthorized and productive of
inevitable discrepancies in the text.
But to the lack of scholarly care in
Shakespeare's first publishers must it
be attributed that in many Instances
the early unauthorized quarto editions
were made the foundation for the folio
printing after Shakespeare's death. As
the joint editors of this new "First
Folio" edition show, however, these
sixteen plays pirated in the quarto
form show signs of revision-at the
iiands of the author In The Folio and
are therefore more nearly authentic in
that form.
After all the floundering about on
the part of Shakespeare editors, the
modern tendency, given strong impulse
by the work of Dr. I*urness, is to a
reversal to the original text with no
tations of variations from that in
chronological order. This Charlotte
Porter and Helen Clarke have done in
their popular edition in a manner
scholarly and complete. Footnotes

to some its best expression In the
"Sacred and Profane Love"â called by
Ridoln in 1618 by the homely tftle, "Two
women near a fountain in which a
child is lo v oking at hjs reflection." In
fact the original title composed, by the
creator . is lost and the one commonly
accepted now found origin with the
Germans. .
â¢According to Groneau it is as a por
trait painter that Titian appeals the
most strongly to modern wielders of
the brush. Of his portraits there are
a score, become familiar to every artist
who essays this difficult art. It was
as the painter of . such canvases that
Titian became the courted of kings and
the honored guest of princes. While
at the court of the Hapsburgs Titian
produced two portraits of Charles the
Fifth and later the famous portrait of
the tyrant Philip of Spain â the latter
"a miracle of art," according to
Morelli. Thus does Groneau char
acterize Titian's genius in this chan
nel of effort:
"He reveals the inmost soul of his
model with a clearness "and keenness
which testify to â¢ hi3 extraordinarily
cool ; observation. Not only the artist
in^ Titian appears to be interested, but
Titian- the man. He observes the car
riage, the gestures, sees the soul re
flected in. the eye, and his hand records
these observations with triumphant
certainty. At the same time he is ever
approaching more nearly to the great
est simplicity and breadth of view."
Very studied and very well put are
all of Groneau's criticisms upon the
manifold aspect of Titian's work. These,
with the running biography which
serves to link together the various ap
preciations, make the book one of a
value not solely for art experts. Any
one of culture may learn much by an
appreciative reading.

AT:. SIDNEY C. TAPP. a
Southern barrister, has writ
ten a Look, -The Story of
Anglo-Sax un Institutions," as
the vehicle for his elaborate-
ly wrought out theory con
cerning the outgrowth of the modern
republican theory and practice of gov
ernment Crom the paternalism and des
potism of older European polities. Mr.
Tapp's theory is interesting if not con
vincing; it falls of the latter quality
because of the fact that in his utter
obsession to the seeming soundness of
his tenets the writer has twisted history
to meet his views and overlooked the
word of authorities with a fine scorn
of any trammeling influences. His be
liefs lead hi:n to put a ctrange and
untoward construction upon accepted
chronicles of past events and to deduce
unusual conclusions from facts here
tofore presumed to admit of but on*
conclusion.
The object of Mr. Tapp's book is to
demonstrate how it is that at last the
free republican idea, which he attrib
utes to the genius of the primitive
Anglo-Saxons, has triumphed over the
despotic and aristocratic propaganda of
â¢Â¦Normanism." By the latter term the
writer incorporates all of the govern
mental principles of feudalism â the di
vine right of kings, the existence of a
titled class through inheritance and the
degradation of the common people. As
suming that this baneful influence of
"Normanism" choked the path of up
ward-springing liberty in Anglo-Sax
on England when it was saddled upon
the conquered peoples by William the
Conqueror, the author proceeds upon
the theory that "Normanism" as
a race characteristic and "Anglo-Sax
onism" as an antagonistic race char
acteristic continued to wage continual
warfare for governmental control
through all England's history and
continue so to do even to-day. The
American republic alone represents
the full and complete triumph of the
one policy over the other; the seed
sown in the heart of the savage Angle
or Jute on the banks of the Elbe,
shadowy in history, has borne ma
ture fruit in the constitutional repub
lic of the United States of America.
As preliminary to the elucidation of
his theory Mr. Tapp reveals himself
as a strict constructionist of constitu
tions, both written and institutional, by
his definition of what constitutes sov
ereignty and what the powers of state.
Supreme sovereignty, resident in the
hands of the people, should delegate
to a government only such authority
as Is necessary to protect all to the
disadvantage or the advantage of none.
The constitution is the paramount law,
delegated by the sovereign power, L e.:
the people, to its agent the govern
ment. In the United States the consti
tution (and this Is a strange thought)
U a pact between States only and not
of the people, and the Federal Govern
ment thereby created Is In no sense a
national government, but a government
of States as corporate bodies.
The author reviews ground made fa
miliar by all studies in government in
his resume of the ancient systems of
Greece and Rome. He denies, however,
that from the republics of Greece or the
early republic of the Romans came any
modicum of what Is now the true re
publican order. The rudiments of rep
resentative government "by the consent
of the governed" he finds, as do others,
In the primitives tribal scheme of those
Teutonic clans that later moved to the
shores of Celtic England. It is agreed
by the authorities that tbÂ« rudiments
of English local government trace their
origin from the ancient Anglo-Saxon
scheme of Wltanagemot and Reeve
Council and that these Institutions sur
vived In modified form the Incursion
ef the Normans with their nascent
feudalism. But does not the author
take a far-fetched view of things when
he declares that had Anglo-Saxon Eng
land remained Isolated from Continent
al Influences, represented In the Nor
mans, republicanism would have flour
lshed unhindered? Here is his asser
tion:
"No class of nobility could have its
origin from them (the Anglo-Saxons).
No upper house of Lords could have
been conceived by their minds. Ac
cording to their thinking and criterion
of government the representatives In
the legislative branch of the govern
ment should be elected by the people.
The idea of appointing a House of
Lords by the crown for life was of
Norman conception and alien brains.
It had Its origin with the 'foreigners/
who had defeated the native Saxons
and established their permanent mis
rale oxer a defeated and suppressed
people."
It does not seem that Mr. Tapp con
siders the fact that feudalism â L e.
"Normanism/* was as much a pre
dominant element In the philosophy of
government of the Middle Ages as ab
solutism was the tenet of seventeenth
and eighteenth century- politics; that

Far larger is the class of people who
take up a novel or a volume of essays
merely to find fault with it and fling
it aside half unread. The attitude of
the .bad-tempered child who does not
know what toy next to break Is the
attitude of many modern readers.
Nothing is more manifestly unfair to
an author than to judge a book by the
mere "skimming" of its pages, though
this injustice becomes almost felon
ious when the merits or demerits of
the work are decided without reading
it all. For instance, Mr. Smith mec^s
Mr. Jones in the train which is tak
ing them out to their several "little
places" in the country. and says:
"Have you read So-and-So's latest
book? If not, don't!" Â¦ Whereupon
Mr. Jones murmurs: "Really! So bad
as all that! Have you read U?" To
which Smith rejoins rudely: "No!
And don't intend to! I've heard all
about it!" And Jones, acquiescing
feebly, decides that he must, "taboo"
that book, also its. author, lest, per
haps Mr. Jones' virtue be put to the
blush at the mention of either. Now,
If Mr. Smith were to dare to condemn
a tradesman in this way and depreci
ate his goods to Mr. Jenes In such a
wise that the latter should be led to
avoid him altogether, that tradesman
could' claim damages for injuring his
character and depriving him of cus
tom. Should not the same rule ap
ply to authors when they are con
demned on mere hearsay? ; Or wflen
their work is willfully misrepresented
and . misquoted in the ' press ? % .
. It may not perhaps be out of place
here to recall a "personal sreminls
cence" of .the willful,, misrepresenta
tion made , to a certain section 'â¢ of \ the
public of a recent novel of mine en
titled "Temporal Power." , That book
had, scarcely, left the printer's hands
when W.; T.. Stead i of the Review- of
Reviews wrote ; me a most cordial
letter me on the work
and averring that it was '''the -best",
of all I had done. But in, his letter
he set forth the startling proposition"
that I "must have, meant" King Ed
ward, our own gracious sovereign,. for
my "fictional" King, Queen' Alexandra
for . the v Queen,; the Prince ? of Wales
for .Â» my Prince Â¦- Humphrey * and J Mr.'
Chamberlain . for .the defaulting,' Sec-,
retary â¢< of ' State, "-; who ; figures r in the
story as ' Carl : Perousse ! - â¢
view of tnÂ» 'whole story. But, while
many who had read the book and not
the review* laughed at the bare notion
of there being any resemblance between
my fictional hero-king of romance and
the sovereign of the British empire,
others, reading the review only, fool
ishly decided that I must have written
some "travesty" :upon English royalty
and condemned the book without read
ing it. This is .what; all authors have
a right to complain ofâ the condemna
tion or censure. of their books by per
sons who cannot read.,. For though
there never was so much reading mat
ter put before the public, 1 ; there was
never less actual "reading" in the
truest and- highest sense of the term.
To read; as? 1 take it* means to sit
down quietly and enjoy a book in its
every line and expression. Whether it
be tragici or humorous, simple or
ornate, it has been written 'to beguile
us from our dally routine. of life and

to create some fair consoling idyll of

'great.' Don't give us new things to

Now. this condition of affairs, which
is so positively disastrous to all liter
ary art, is entirely brought about by
the lack of one vital point In the mod
ern education of the British and Amer
ican people, namely, that they have
not been taught how to read. As a
roFuit of this they ' frequently pro
nounce a book "too long" or "too dull"
âtoo this, or too that, without having
looked at more than perhaps twenty
pages of its contents. As an example
of what I mean I will here relate a
little experience of my own which I
purposely entered upon for my own
instruction and entertainment, con
cerning a novel which I greatly admire
â"Simon Dale," byAnthony Hope. Dur
ing one entire year 1 made it my busi
ness to ask a goodly number of well
to-do "reading" people their opinions
on this book and I found that not one
of all whom I asked had read it ac
tually through. One lady, of such
"blue" blood that I should not like to
risk comparisons without having what
washer women call "the blue bag" be
side me as a witness to its color, as
sured me that it was the most delight
ful book Ehe had ever read. When I
atked her what character in it she
liked the best she replied: "Oh, Simon,
of course â that dear big man who was
so fond of I^orna! And Lorna herself!
What a creation." And then I found
she was talking of "I-orna Doone." I
saidâ "but that's by Blackmore." "Yes,
of course!" she agreed vivaciouslyâ
"That's the man you meant, isn't it?"
"Not exactly," I answered. "I was
speaking of 'Simon Dale,' by Anthony
Hope. An-thon-y Hopeâ you know his
name, of course?" Her face fell. "Oh
yes!" she said. "He wrote 'Dodo. 1 I
didn't like 'Dodo'!" It will, I think, be
agreed that It was no use entering
into any discussion as to the ' merits
of "Simon Dale" with this excellent
gentlewoman, who, however, 13 only
one of the very large "educated" class
who do not know how to read. They
have never learned â and some of them
will never learn. They cannot realize
the unspeakable delight and charm of
giving one's self up to one's author,
sans prejudice, sans criticism; sans
everything that could possibly break
or mar the spell, being carried on the
wings of gentle ' romance away from
self, away from the everyday cartes
and petty personalities of social con
vention and observance and living
â¢with". the characters which have been
created by the man or .woman. whose,
fertile brain and toiling pen have unit
edly done their best to give this little
respite and holiday to those who will
take it and rejoice In it with gratitude."
But unfortunately these are few.

This essential of education is sadly

liud the very ones who cannot read,
who frequently cannot spell and whose
handwriting is so bad ns to be well

they cannot read that statement is not
by an; - mearts intended to convey the
idea, that if a book or newspaper !>??
privc-n to them they do not understand
the letters or the print in which the
reading matter is presented to their
eyes. They do. But euch letters and
such print impress no meaning upon
their minds. Any one can prove this by
merely; asking them what they have
bees reading. In nine cases out of te*
they "don't know." And if they evei
did know, during one unusual moment

ever fo boldly in no matter what start
linjrly stout headlines, barely excites

They may oerhaps glance at a couple
of newspaper placards and lazily ob
serve â¢â¢Hussia at it again." but of the
ins and outs of policy, the difficulties
of Government, the work of nations,
they grasp absolutely ncthins.
Thus it happens that when tfiey are

utter . ignorance in such a frankly
stupid fashion that any intelligent in

n.urmur feebly: "Have you not read
the news?" to which will come the
v.:jrue retily â "Oh. yes. I read all the
newspapers! But 1 really don't re
member the particulars just now!"
What they do remember â these "cul
tured" persons (and the more highly
they are cultured the more tenacious
i? their memory on the point) â Is u
divorce case. They always rend that
carefully over and over again. They
comment upon it afterward with such
gusto as to make it evident to the
merest tyro that th'ey have learned all

only revel in the published shame and

The "million" have long ago learned

which those who seek to govern them

what wondrous new notions and dis

of seething ideas 'round which they

Mmjjly because people do not know
how to read. Moreover, it is very
difficult to make them learn. They
have neither the skill nor the patience
to study beautiful thoughts expressed
in beautiful language. They want to

ro common among: modern so-called
"readers" of books, can but make

honestly seek to contribute something
of their utmoEt best to the world of
literature. Most men and women who
feel the "divine ; afflatus" and who ere

rise yet higher than any of their own
attempted efforts, and to do something
new, strong and true enough to hold

craving of the, "sick eagle looking at

noble craving. In taking an aim it. is

should hope that the English author
would stay at home .and mind his or
her business. But let us suppose that

for English literature" v were true, it
would seem that Americana/ even more
than the British, require to be taught
"how" to read. If one may Judge from
their own output of literature the les
son la badly needed. Ralph - Waldo
Emerson remains as yet their biggest
literary man. He knew how. to read
and from that knowledge learned how
to write. But no American author has
come after him that can be called
greater than he, or as great. Concern
ing the art of fiction, the American
"make" of it, as exemplified In "David
Harum" and "Mrs. Wiggs of the Cab
bage Patch," is, whatever the imme
diate "patching on" of it may be, dis
tinctly ephemeral, of the utmost
ephemeral. Such "literature" would
not exist even In America if Americans
knew "how" to read. What Is called
the "yellow Journalist" would not exist
either, because a really educated reader
of things worth reading would not read
itâ and it would, therefore, be a case
of the wicked ceasing to trouble and
the weary being at rest, j -~A
There is a general complaint nowa
days â especially among authors^-of the
"decadence" of* literature. It's true
enough. But the cause of the "deca
dence" is. the sameâ simply and solely
that people cannot and will not read.
They do not know how to do it. If they
ever did know In the bygone days of
Dickens and Thackeray they hÂ«.ve for

them. Yet scarcely any novel is pub
lished now aa long as the novels of
Dickens, which were so eageriy de
voured at one time by tens- of thou
sands of admiring readers. A short,
risky, rather â¢'nasty" book (reviewers
would call It strong, but that is only a
little Joke of theirsâ they speak of this
kind of literature as though it were
cheese) finds most favor with the "up
per" circles of society in Great Britain
and America. , Not so with the "mil
lion." thoueh. The million prefer sim
pler fareâ and they read a good deal
though scarcely in the right way. It Is
more a case of "skimming" than read
ing., if they are ever taught the right
way to read they may become wiser
than political governments would like
them to be. For right reading makes

makes right livingâ and right living

tell those English authors that they are

your answer or wishes on the subject.
I am unnerved. I must plead guilty
to the charge of impetuosity â my feel

meant to beat about the bush, to re

you took shelter under my umbrella at
the Penny Headings last winter, but
such reminiscences, however delightful
to me, seem a little cruel to recall to
you if you cannot bring yourself to re
ciprocate the warm affection, respect,
reverence and love with which you
have Inspired me. Puny boys of twen
ty may sneer at me for loving you.
You must remember, my dear Miss
Smith, that I am forty. These extreme
ly young people never think of any one
but themselves; they affect to deem It
ridiculous that what they call "an bid

fall in love. But, my dear Miss Smith,

*So many of the sleeves fall back from
the hand that one must be forever on
the lookout for glove fads. One of the
most recent ls the fad for trimming the
tops of gloves. To do this you take a
frill of lace and set it upon a shirred
or plaited ribbon, which Is set around
the top of the glove in such a way that
the lace will fall forward over the
glove.
Another glove fad shows a little box
plaiting of white satin ribbon set
. around the wrist or top of the glove.
There are Imported gloves showing a
contrasting color In the lining and, In
such a case, the ribbon must match the
lining. of the glove, and even the but
tons are made to- match. â¢
New Shoes and Their Heels.
And. whllfr speaking of gloves, onÂ«
cannot but think of shoes/which have
become more â¢ decorative and conse
quently more prominent. â¢ Fashion has
turned away -/from j the . square-toed
shoes to the points, again.- Dress shoes
-are made of fine black leather, very
high In the heels, very low In. the vamp
and very pointed In the toes..
The neatest of all shoes Just now
are the plain thin black walking
boots, high, buttoned with large black
buttons and ; very pointed as well aa
very full as to finish. This neat boot
13 worn for the street with the hand
some dark taffeta costumes.
Heels, while they are growing high
er, are not so vÂ£ry bad after all. They
loops and ls usoÂ« vÂ» decorate the hat.
And velvet ls laid on In standing folds
and one fold overlaps the other, so that
the colors contrast.
The very prettiest effects are obtain
ed for. fall by taking contrasting folds
of velvet and setting them upright
around a hat. At one side there Is
placed a handsome buckle.' This ls the
tailor-made hat.' On a dressier hat
there can be an ostrich plume or a big
handsome chou of ribbon or a big win
ter rose. .
Roses are to be conspicuously used
this winter In the trimmings of hats.
The single rose will stand. at the front
of the hat, with a large rose at J each
side of It. Three roses make a pretty
trimming for any style of hat. â¢
Milliners have no hesitancy 'In say-
Ing that hats will be very bright this
winter, not to . say gay. There is a
tendency to take up the hat of. many

It was the Countess de Castellans
who changed the style in ostrich feath
ers. Feathers that trailed last season
are now bunched and grouped upon the
hat. The single long trailing plume,
while it will never go completely out of
style, ls much less fashionable than It
used to be. The tendency now ls more
toward the higher trimmings. Feathers
are trained over the crowns of hats or
are bunched in a group, which ls set
well toward the front.
,. How to Get Pretty Effects.
And there is another style of feather
trimming which will be very popular
this fall and winterâ the lyre feather.
An ostrich plume is turned Inside out,
so to speak, and ls tightly curled. It ls
then trained around the brim of the
hat, or underneath the brim,' or ls used
as a feather trimming to go around the
crown. All one's old feathers can be
treated In this way.
While ostrich plumes will lead the
trimming styles, there are other trim
mings which will be fashionable, and
one of these is the stiff ribbon bow
trimming. Ribbon ls bunched In stilt

A very unique opera hat was worn
by a Parisian last winter. 'It con
sisted of a tiara of diamonds set into
the middle of a great big Alsatian bow
of turquoise blue velvet. This was set
on top of the' head-.* It lacked only the
strings to be a bonnet.

Hats With I/ow-Necked Gowns.
A. particular effort is being made to
popularize the colored felt hats, but
just how fair woman will take to them
is a question. The baby blue felts are
very pretty and Lady Randolph
Churchill Is wearing one trimmed with
a shaded blue plume which is draped
over the top of the crown,, while the
under side of the* hat is faced with a
very heavy white lace. .
The red felts are very showy and one
needs only one hat of thlskind a^sea
son. It can be worn only ; once In a
while on account of its very distinctive
qualities. One soon tires of It. -
All Indications co to show that con
trasting hats will be the style. With
a black gown one can wear a red hat
or a blue hat-and .with a brown dress
one has a nice choice of: hats running
In every shade . from yellow to dark
brown and green. ,
One , of the Washington belles is
wearing- a very handsome gown or
gray and blue checked . silk ? made up
with cherry satin. " With this gown she
wears . a . cherry-eolored hat, .,- brilliant
and without a particle of contrast.
It will be quite the; thing for the
well dressed woman to own a blue hat,
a red hat, an all white hat and a black
frame the face as nothing else can do.
Â¦ ji A;beautiful French : woman Is wear-
Ing a wide* brlmmed'hat tied under.the
chin with tulle streamers. This is
something on the style of a poke, but
the hat is not tied so closely down into
poke shape. The brim flares and the
streamers are tied down over it.
The innovation of automobile fashion
has changed the styles not. a .little.
Women have discovered how. lmmense
ly becoming the veil can be. ' And more
and more is it utillze'd in the trimming
of hats. The automobile hats which
are made bv the draping of a veil can
be got together very cheaply. It
takes enough veiling to shirr around
the top of the hat, where it is pulled
up until it just fits the crown. The
veiling is now crossed at the back and
the ends are brought front and fasten
ed with a brooch upon the gown, or are
tucked in the belt. The veil can be
pulled down over the face if desired.
The cost of: a very up-to-date automo
bile hat is less than a dollar if man
aged in this way, for the veil entirely
covers the hat, and any old hat will do.

hat, besides a number of hats to match
the different costumes. If it be true,
as the fashion designers assert, that
hats can be worn season after season,
as long as their shape holds good, then
a handsome hat is a good investment
and the woman who pays $25 for a hat
can feel that she is going to have, it
for several years to come. This is
quite' different from buying a hat that
is to be thrown away at the end of
three months.
The hat is undoubtedly the keynote
to the costume, for It mirrors the dress.
The great handsome picture hats of
chiffon and feathers are worn with call
ing and reception costumes, while the
new little compact hats, with their stiff
coque feathers or prim rosettes and
chouXj. and their beaded designs, are
for less formal wear.
The day of mitts is returning, and
their popularity is due to the Marie
Antoinette sleeve. This is a little sleeve
which is. tight to the elbow, where It is
met by a wide ruffle of lace which fails
over the arm. This sleeve is used for
dinner gowns and for evening dresses.
It has been worn more or less aU sum
mer and will be the. fashionable sleeve
of the. coming winter. It Is particularly
handsome as an opera sleeve, being
neither too short for good taste nor too
long for elegance. .
The Makinz of a Gown.
"I get; fine results," said a modiste,
* : with. embroidery of all kinds. I re
cently recei^d an order from a cus
tomer asking for a dark blue taffeta
gown. The . style . desired was the
tailored gown of the present season.
You know Â¦, what that means. The
plaited skirt flaring around the foot,
but tight around the hips and the
blouse with wrinkled back and full
front and wide girdle.
**I nurchased such a gown outright
in the shops, plain and pretty. Then
"I brought it back to my workrooms
and set my girls at work upon it. Â¦ I
â¢set them embroidering a vine of for
get-me-nots around the neck and
working a vine of the same flowers

A third hat. also for fall wear, is a

The Big High Crowned Ilata.
Hats are certainly determined to
know no middle ground. Either they
are extremely large or they are little
bats. For wedding occasions, and for
other extremely full dress events, the
tiny hat Is worn. But it Is seldom be
coming and is laid aside for the more
picturesque big hat.
Plcturesqueness Is actually demand

It Is perfect There Is no such thing
as a ready-made hat these days. All

shopping. Mrs. Roosevelt's gown was
taffeta. It was a two-piece suit, skirt

ings of yellow-white silk. Her hat was
a very large sailor affair, flat and made
of gray Etraw. A bunch of cherries
trimmed the 6ide and there were bows
of cherry ribbon.
Her Majesty, Queen Margherita of

Is to be presumed ore for her approach

FALL HATS OF
FASHIONABLE PEOPLEvelops every muscle evenly and
strongly. Do not try to rush this, but
take it very slowly at first and be cer
tain to practice it until you can do It
a dozen times with ease.
Always open all the windows to ad
mit the fresh air and sunshine, for
both are deadly enemies of Mr. Microbe
and are never so happy as when they
are exterminating him.
A good plan is to stand head and
shoulders in the window and take a
simple exercise. Do not be afraid of a
breath of fresh air. It will not harm
you in the least; in fact. It will drive
all the cobwebs away from a sleepy
brain and give you a I'm-glad-to-be
alive feeling. Stand perfectly strelght,
heels together and the arms extended
straight In front with the palms touch-
Ing. Separate the palms and move the
arms backward, and at the same time
draw In a deep, full breath. Next throw
the arms as far back as possible while
the lungs are expanded and then re
verse the exercise and exhale a breath.
The simpler the exercise^ the more
Some people advocate dumb-bells tor
building up of the chest, but I do not
deem them necessary, as the same ex
ercises can be gone through without
them and with the same results. For
Instance, one of the best known exar
clses Is to rest the hands easily en
the shoulders and then throw the anas
out and back ten times, alternating
first the right and then the left. Th*
bells add a little weight to be. sure
and I will admit they are a tangible
something to hold on to. but the
clenched fists do quite as well and It
is not necessary to go to this additional
expense.
The great point about taking any
exercise Is to be persistent in it. Afttr
a coxtaln time there is bound to come
a period of deadly monotony and it is
at this time that you must get right
down to business, for you have reached
the place where the work is telling and
really benefiting you.
You cannot develop, your chest in a
day or a week, or any othÂ«r part oÂ£
your body for that matter, but you
can do a great deal toward it in
three or four months. No matter how
lnpatient you are to forge ahead, never
exercise when overfatlgued, or directly
after eating, for it will do you, far
more harm than good.
Do you know what makes girls fiat
chested? Simply this: When the lungs
are fully expanded they press the ribs
and the breast-bone outward and of
course it follows that when the air
cells are never opened the ribs are
not forced into their proper place and
the result is a caved in appearance.
And for this reason the simplest ex
ercises are correct. Anything that will
call for repeated lung expansion. Hop
ping, skipping and jumping are all
good, especially for children, and after
one has passed a certain number of
years singing lessons take their place
and are truly excellent.
There are few women who read a
great deal, who write persistently or
who are afflicted with defective vision
that are not more or less troubled with
round shoulders. This Is one of the
most exasperating afflictions in the
world to cure and the first thing to do
is to make up your mind fully to
straighten up immediately. You will
have to exert your will power Just tho
same as every one else has to deter
mine fully to break a bad habit. While
round shoulders are sometimes the re
sult of weakness they are more often
the result of absolute carelessness and
when such is the case it should be a
mental and not a physical exertion.
Nearly every stooper sleeps on a very
high pillow, and this should be the very
first change, for really no pillow at all
is necessary, and particularly under
these circumstances. But during the
waking hours try to remember to stand
erect. Stand up and look up, net down.
Round-shouldered persons are not gen
erally aware of the fact that they
rarely look people In the eye as they
walk. Thy are too busy thinking of
their own troubles, and it is the easiest
thing In the world to acquire the habit
of prowling about looking at the ground
and Just glancing up often enough to
keep from being stepped on.
Now for this there are two cures. One
Is to practice walking about your room
with a book balanced on your head, and
the other is to lace your hands behind
the back and pull the shoulders back
and force the arms downward as far
as is possible, as In Fig. 4. Then raise
the arms as high as you can and re
peat some ten or twelve times up and
down. At the end of this time hold the
arms down and roll the shoulders from
front to rear, alternating the up and
down exercise with the rolling one.
And I want to tell you a little some
thing about this particular exercise.
It has been adopted for general use in
the German army and has been bor
rowed for West. Point as well and all
on account of this. Some of the men.
especially in Germany, were powerful,
big fellows, but they couldn't stand
erect to save their lives. Perhaps their
work had been picking up vegetables
or working with a hoe. where they were
continually bending over. In all other
ways their bodies were strong and
powerful, but in this respect they were
sadly lacking, and j the looks of the
army were anything; but pleasing. Yet
the fault could not be laid at the door *
of the soldiers. They honestly tried to
stand up, but it was a physical impos
sibility. Instead of giving them all
sorts and conditions of extrdses to de
velop first this part and then that, the
officers put them to work at this one
alone, and to-day there is not an army
that boasts of more erect soldlsry men
than that of Germany.
There is but one more exercise that
I wish to speak of, and that is No. 3.
The diaphragm Is drawn up into the
chest as far as Is possible, and the
breath is exhaled by saying "hoi"
Don't think this is a bit of foolish
ness, but, believe me, unless "ho!" is
said in a loud, sharp tone, the results

this, but I heartily agree with the per

inspirations to clear the lungs of the
old and to fill all the cells with pure
air. After this the blood goes bound
ing through the veins, and a peculiar
sensation comes and makes you feel as
though you had expanded a few Inches
in all directions. And, of a truth, if you
keep up the good work such will be the
case. I know it seems such a little
thing to breathe, but it frequently
makes the difference between a con
sumptive and an athlete.

But enthusiasm depends alto upon
leadership. We are so built that' the

some person, living or dead, by the
nobility of his character or the glory of
his achievements, or by both, lays hold
on our imagination- and our affection,
kindles within us a desire to be like him
and knits out hearts to him in bonds of
a deep, undying attachment. The hero
worshiper in us dies hard, and when
it is dead our capacity for enthusiasm
usually dies also. There are many lead
ers of thought and action available out
of the ranks of the heroes and heroines

thoughts of anger, revenge and hatred travel in sharp, jagged points, like
a "two-edged sword." Thoughts of kindness, "good thoughts," are seen to f
form into curves, creating about the person who sends them forth a mag

Mrs. Lacquerre asked the concluding question, with a swift change to
almost childish simplicity which convinced me that, strange as it seems,
she was uninformed on the most vital problem we have to meet. I gladly
elucidated the policic's involved in the government of our insular pos
sessions, and informed her that she would be much improved by my
remarks on the subject at the banner raising. She was greatly provoked
to find that the date conflicted with an important social engagement she
attached to the income hadn't views on imperialism. Poor devil, he did
not know what the girl meant when she asked him. Gee! What's imperial
ism when a man with a hundred thou' i year is asking you to go to St.
Thomas with him? By the way, Reuben, what the deuce is imperial-
There, Uncle Silas, is a fair report of several conversations I had with
Aunt Sarah. I am not a vain man, in spite of what warrant I may have
for vanity. I am, I hope, a man of natural gallantry, therefore I refrain
from even hinting to you ray sudden suspicion that Aunt Sarah had de
signs which would make me her son-in-law as well as her nephew. If I
permitted myself so to hint it would explain to you why my letters have
lacked allusions to Aunt Sarah. In short, I go to her house only for
such periodical and formal calls as my duty prescribes.
Mrs. Lacquerre. in relation to her daughter, is quite unlike Aunt
Sarah. She has. as I have faithfully reported, said, with the frankness
so .characteristic of her, that she would like to have me for a .son-in-law.
But her later comment* on the subject deprive her views of any shade of
compliment. There is nothing personal to me in her preference; it re
lates wholly to my bank account. Recently, when I called to ask her to
the ceremonies of the Reuben Larkmead Social and Outing Club banner
raising, she said to me: "This political pother of yours may make you
strong with Frances. She's a queer proposition, that gal of mine is, and

You'd do, of course, but I'm not booming Frances to you. She's cranky.
She refused a hundred thousand a vea.r last month because the man
However, Aunt Sarah knew, and professed to be deeply incensed, de
claring that she had been made ridiculous by having a nephew of hers
follow, the example of every fool boy in New York, who, it appears, has
the habit of proposing marriage to Mrs. Jack Lacquerre.
"Wiih your serious, intellectual training," remarked Aunt Sarah to me
with painful severity of mien, "I felt safe in the belief that you would not
be trapped by Mrs. Jack's flinty beauty and slangy wit!"
"Dear Aunt Sarah." I responded."your reproof may be deserved, but it
is based upon false premises; I was not trapped but repulsed by Mrs.
Lacquerre. I now hold toward her a relationship marked by amiability
and confidence, not so much as tinsred by sentiment. Mrs. Lacquerre's
refusal of me was singularly decisive, but she generously suggested the
continuance of our acquaintance for the purpose, as she quaintly phrased it,
of 'saving me.' " This explanation, so far from allaying Aunt Sarah's ruf
fled temper, seemed but to arouse it to more perplexing feminine flights.
"Save you!" she sneered â I had almost written "snorted," but we
should practice restraint in describing woman's manifestations of humors.
"A man with your income needs no saving. Young men without incomes
may -need saving and usually do, but worldly salvation is one of the con
ditions attached to an income like vours. What that woman wants is <o
train you up f6r that blackfaced slip of a prig, Frances, her daughter."
"Dear Aunt," I cried in confusion, "Mrs. Lacquerre is as little likely
to want me for Frances as I am to want Frances or Frances want me."
This earnest assertion much mollified aunt, and she continued in more
amicable accents:
"Well, Reuben. I was shocked at hearing of your silly infatuation for
Mrs. Jack, but if it has all passed and you are certain that you have" no
tendre for Frances little harm is done. I have^ no patience with that
girl Frances! She assumes a manner. Nothing is Mich bad manners as
a manner. She goes about with that beak of a nose of hers tilted at the
world as if ihe found most of it not good enough for her and didn't
happen to like. the rest. She has refused half a dozen good offers for
the delirious reason that the men who proposed had done nothing! A
man who has a good income by that fact alone has done everything on
earth any sane woman can ask of any man. Now, my daughter â I refer
to your dear cousin Josephine â has no such silly oddities. She would ask
nothing of a man with an income. She is sane and safe. She is a girl
who will make a lovely wife for some man. Even the biggest fool liv
ing could get along with Josephine. Here the dear child comes now. Drive
in the park with her, Reuben, and then come back for tea. I feel as if
I were going to have a headache or I'd go with you. It gives me a
headache to drive in the park in summer â trying to avert my eyes from
men I know who are driving with women I don't know. But you and
Josephine will get along together nicely."
cacy with which you have ever considered my feelings in all re
spects is proof to me that you did not make this inquiry with a view to
recalling my proposal for the hand of Mrs. Jack Lacquerre, which pro
ceeded as a direct result of that coaching trip. Yet I am compelled to
recall that incident in explaining why I have so infrequently enriched
these letters with allusions to Aunt Sarah and Cousin Josephine.
Soon after the inauspicious misreading of my heart which impelled
me to offer it to Mrs. Lacquerre â mistaking a lively personal interest in
that lady for a tenderer sentiment â it became evident to me that Aunt
Sarah had been made aware of the incident. Something, which for lack
of a better name we call intuition, told me that Mrs. Lacquerre had not
informed Aimt Carah of my declaration. It may be that Mrs. Lacquerre's
serving maM (whom I nearly overturned behind the portieres when I
abruptly left the room) was Aunt Sarah's informant. I am told that
j.uch maids at times earn gratuities of slightly used gloves, parasols and
other utilities of feminine attire by repeating the particulars of any scene
of a sentimental or roguish nature of which they have independent though
surreptitious knowledge. #
DEAR UNCLE SILAS: I note your inquiry concerning my rela
tions with Aunt Sarah and Cousin Josephine. You remind me that
I have not mentioned them since my letter relating the incidents
of our coaching trip to the Country Club. The undeviating deli-
could not evade, but assured me that Frances would go if I had a petti
coat in my party to chaperon her.
I had, as the result of vour wish that I see more of Aunt Sarah,
asked her and Cousin Josephine to be my guests on banner raising nicht.
so I inquired, somewhat doubtfully, if Aunt Sarah would answer as
chaperon for Frances. Mrs. Lacquerrc replied with much glee that the
plan was admirable. "Your Aunt Sally hates Frances and Frances hates
your atmt, to they'll do beautifully as chaperon and maid." she said.
The banner raising is this evening, and I must interrupt this letter
to go once more over my speech, which, as I have intimated, will deal
with the ouestions of imperialism and of our foreign policy as it should
be directed in regard to the ultimate adjustment of the Far East prob
lem.
I drove with, my partyâ Aunt Sarah, Josephine and Frances â to the
hall for the banner raising, and was much gratified to be received by a
vast' number of enthusiastic citizens, led by rhy manager, Mr. Hogan,
all of whom received me with hilarious shouts, inquiring, "What's the mat
ter with Reuben Larkmead?'* and the response, "He's all right!" I could
not but observe, as we alighted from our carriage in the glare of many
electric lights, that while Frances seemed elated and "lit up." 'as the
saying is, by the crowd and the shouts, both aunt and Josephine were
nervous and even alarmed. They repeatedly asked if it would be safe
for them to go into the hall filled with such common people as were there
gathered to greet us. and Frances was assuring them that so far as she
was concerned she was- delighted for once to be close to the common
people, and only wished that she was going to have a chance to talk to
them.
Mr. Hogan and a young female he introduced as "Mysteady" â a for
eign name, I assume â escorted us to the hall and seated us on the stage,
where there were a number of young ladies of the same nationality, pre
sumably, as Miss Mysteady. The hall rapidly filled until there was no
more room for spectators, and then Mr. Hogan introduced me in terms
my modesty forbids me to repeat, and instantly there were loud demands
for "Speech!"
I was prepared and at once began my oration. For a little time the
crowd was silent, but soon there were interruptions, which I could not but
feel intimated an impatience with my subject. This surprised me, for I
had been informed that my audience included men who made their liv
ing by politics, and my speech dealt only with topics which every noliti
cian should be eager to hear discussed. I overheard through all the tu
mult frequent expressions of fear from aunt and Josephine, but Frances
was silent, though once when I glanced at her I saw that her cheeks and
eyes burned with indignant reproof of the interruptions. These became
more unmannerly, and at last there were Â¦ churlish demands for "Leave
to print," "Sing it to us" and other irrelevant cries.
I am slow to wrath. I felt that my hearers needed just the instruc
tion I was giving to them and I determined to continue if possible.
Soon it was impossible. There were cries for me to return to the woods.
though there are no woods near Beetville; suggestions that my hair was
powdered with hayseed and other comments which at last merged into
laughter and jeers of such volume and strength that I could not even hear
myself. Still, I ..should have persisted had not a sudden and dramatic
silence distracted me, and. turning to follow the surprised glances of the
audience, I saw Frances rise from her seat and approach the front of the
platform with hand uplifted and eves blazing. Out of the silence, which
was now as striking as the tumult had been, her voice rose clear and de
termined. "I am the daughter of the late Jack ' Lacquerre, who was a
leader here when you dogs had a gentleman for leader. Do you remem
ber him? Did he ever fear vou?" I was as dumfounded as the other
hearers, for there was absolutely no response other than the breath of
low, excited questionings. .
"You know me." she continued. "You recognize a lady. Why do
you not recognize a gentleman when you are so fortunate as to see one.
You are ignorant, yet when this gentleman comes to instruct you you
act like cowardly beasts. } I wish I were a man!" At this point there
were interruptions, and to my surprise all of a nature which showed that
Frances, instead of offending the men by her words, had pleased them
mightily.
"Go it, lady!" they cried. "You are the real thing. What's the matter
with Jack Lacquerrc's girl? She's all right. You write Reuben's speeches
and we'll listen!" -jj.
I was quite overwhelmed with conflicting emotions. Here I was
protected in effect by a slender gtrl, unable to control a mob she quelled
with ease. I felt my throat swell, so that for an instant, though I tried,
I could not speak. My slow wrath was rising, and I began to see red,
as they s.ay of those insane with rage. I wanted some object to vent
my anger upon and it was given to me. While nearly every man in the
hall was cheering and encouraging Frances a little group near the stage
showed that the beer they had imbibed had made them sullen instead of
joyous. One of this group shouted at Frances, "We don't want no swell
rag like you to come here and lecture us. To Newport with the other
monkeys, for yours!" .:'. .â¢;â¢ .'
Then I lost control of mvself. I jumped from the stage and had that
ruffian's throat in my hands almost before I landed on my feet. A
man of my temperament needs much shock of opposition before he is
physically aroused. I was struck in the face by one of the man's com
panions, and then for the first time in my life I exerted all my strength.
I struck out "madly and soon had a cleared space about me, and at my
feet lay, my assailants.
Others came in to assail, but ahead of them was Hogan. with some
companions, and they fought for me. There wa3 a few minutes' uproar,
and then Hogan announced that I would continue my remarks unless
there were any more gentlemen who needed attention. Although I was
conscious that I had acted most unwisely, to my surprise I was now
frantically cheered and encouraged to go on. However, I abandoned my
prepared speech, and in ray passion I talked fiercely about the rights of
free speech, and was soon as enthusiastically cheered as I had been
jeered. At the conclusion, of my remarks I looked about for mv partv.
and found them gone. Hosan explained that aunt and cousin hysteri
cally demanded to be taken away and he had escorted them to my car
riage, with. Miss Lacquerrc, and sent them home, the latter protesting
that she wanted to see the finish, and going reluctantly.
I supposed that I had made an utter and dismal failure, of my entrance
into politics, but to my surprise I was visited to-day by a committee con
sisting of Hoeran and the men I had thrashed, and they answered me that
I had made a genuine hit and could get the support of every man in the
district for anything I wanted. Hogan as good as confessed that he
had started in to confidence me out of what money he could, but now he
really saw a future for me. (\v -
' y "Ah, then," said I, "my remarks on imperialsim made an effect after
all." â¢ Â¦ ..
"No, boss," replied. Hogan. "What mikes you strong with my gang
is that the man you first choked last night â this gent with his throat tied
U p has been the champion and unlicked middleweight of the district."

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALH

ADVENTURES OF REUBENnR. J. MILTON MAYBE was an author; at least he took that
position. No one else was particularly aware of him or his
work, although the office boys of various and sundry publica
tions in different parts of the country could probably remem
ber reading the first page of some of his manuscripts preparatory
to pinching half of the inclosed postage and returning the manu
script to him with twelve cents due on it. Mr. Maybe and other uafor
tunates of his ilk were of the opinion that most of the profits of maga
zine manufacturers come from the malicious and surreptitious appropri
ation of return postage forwarded by hopeful but deluded authors. For
some time J. Milton had been assisting several publishers to pry the
mortgages off their country places and add an annex to their brown
stone fronts on Fifth avenue â half of the publishing business is front,
anyway, and the other half is side; very few of the participants have any
backing.
When J. Milton Maybe first purchased his typewriter and came to
the conclusion that the literary life was the life for him, he hadn't, any
doubtj whatever as to how he was to turn the trick. He was to deluge
the reading public from Machias to Guam with draughts from an un
failing well of English, pure and undefiled. It wasn't his intention to
write for a living, except incidentally. That's the way most writing
people live, anyway, so he wasn't contemplating any serious break with
the traditions of the profession. Where he did turn his back on a long
and glorious past was in the assumption that an author didn't need to
pay any particular attention to what people wanted. This is ona of the
cheerfully idiotic theories formulated by alleged authors who have had
the good sense to choose rich parents and can induce impecunious pub
lishers to commute their self-respect for gold. It's not an easy task to
buy a publisher, unlees you have the money or a certified check right
with you, but it can be done by those who know the ropes.
It's a remarkable fact that the only class of individuals who appear
to think that they are absolved from any considerations of common
sense are the ones who are torturing typewriters and adding to the in
come of the United States Postal Department. .' The man who caters to
the fleshly wants of tlie population doesn't try to sell watermelons when
the populace are clamoring for buckwheat cakes and maple syrup, or
fur-lined overcoats when the general demand is for duck trousers and
palm leaf fans. A man who has a job lot of rat traps to dispose of
doesn't send agents to Greenland to place his goods before the public.
With the exception of the gentlemen who are producing literature,* the
working classes generally proceed on the assumption that -the proper
thing to turn loose on the world is the article that the world wants, or
thinks it wants, which amounts to the same thing. Only the littera
teurs â which is French for people who live without working â have the
idea firmly rubbed into their cerebellums that the proper caper is to find
out what a man wants and then offer him something else.'
Mr. Maybe held to the belief that a literary man should be quiet
and retiring. When 'he had turned out something that occurred to him
as rather more than half good, the right play was to abuse it as though
it was a lost dog that had camped in his alley over night. He should
never under any circumstances admit/ that there was anything in the
children, of his brain that was worth the â¢ consideration of a sensible
man for more than seven or eight minutes, and not for that long if
there was anything else in sight worth doing. He would point to
Shakespeare and Dante and Old Sleuth and other authors as
examples of modest and retiring authorship. These men didn't need
press agents to impress the public with their fine points or to boost
themselves up into the list of the six best sellers.
What the world needed was men who would pour their souls out
on paper and then set them away to dry, trusting to luck and the ulti
mate destiny of literature and murder and the point of an English joke
to come to the surface to save them from oblivion. Having laid out the
ground plan for his idea of the literary' life in*a manner to satisfy his
inmost desire for obscurity, Mr. Maybe proceeded to withdraw into the
inmost recesses of his inner consciousness, where no one could see him
and he could be alone with his s"oul. It never occurred to him that it
might be as well to let people know something about the source from
which the healing streams of literature were to flow. People are pe
culiar that way, but it's an unquestionable and undodgable fact that
most of as would rather do business with an established firm that we
know something about than with a lockbox in the postoffice and a guar
anteed profit of 150 per cent.
This large truth began to dawn upon J. Mijton's intellectual vision
when his manuscripts began to round to in the home port, after a long
but uneventful voyage. "The editors agreed that some of them weren't
bad, at least not all bad, but they seemed to be afraid that Mr. JMaybe's'
name wouldn't be sufficiently impressive on the front cover as the au
thor of the valuable article on "From Congress to Jail" in this issue.
It's no use' trying to win the comeons' money Â¦ with a horse that one
has never heard of. Therefore J. Milton discovered that his highly in
tellectual articles on subjects that no one -knew anything about, were
likely to continue in the same class as the subjects. All his cerebral out
pourings seemed destined to waste their sweetness on the desert air of
the pigeon holes of J. Milton's roll-top desk. In the course of the first
year he papered his study with rejection slips from editors announcing
that "circumstances compel Â¦ the return of your manuscript, although
our action implies no lack of merit"â meaning that the stuff was too
rotten for any use. Two secretaries and an office boy were kept busy
sorting the returned manuscripts and starting them out on their next
trip.
About this time Mr. Maybe began to wonder if he hadn't made a
mistake about the desirability of keeping himself out of the fierce light
of publicity. He noticed also that most men who have something good
to sell aren't particularly reluctant to tell the world that it's the best
thing ever. Just as an experiment, J. Milton decided that he would try
that kind of a game fof a while himself. To this end he set his secre
taries at work sending out , literary notices like the following: "That
well-known man of letters, J. Milton Maybe, was stabbed in the left
thumb with a fishhook yesterday. At last reports he was doing as well
as could be expected and the accident is not expected to interfere^with
his literary labors, as he does not use his left thumb on the typewriter."
"Mr. Maybe, the famous author of 'Manuscripts I Have Known,* has
purchased a new red wheelbarrow for his country place. He says that
literature pays." "Mr. J. M. Maybe will not admit that he wrote any of
Shakespeare's plays." "It will be interesting to many of his readers to
learn that Mr. J. Milton Maybe drinks water at every meal; he also
wears clothes and eats food."
Â¦ This sort of mental pabulum had been on the rounds for about a
month when he began to observe a difference in the returns; that is to
say, there weren't so many returns. In six months he had cleaned out
most of the manuscripts in his desk and the editors were camping on his
doorstep clamoring for more, while the presses waited. After that it
was all clear sailing.. Nowadays his stenographers work in shifts and
three college graduates are kept busy looking up dates and names for
the foundations of his historical novels. He may not be so literary, but
he has the public by the ear, and when he wants to say something nice
he knows that he can bank on having an audience.
This, may not be a cheerful tale for those who believe that literature
is Us own reward, but it teaches some valuable lessons for the average
man who has a prejudice in favor of three square meals a day and two
suits of clothes per annum. One of the most valuable of these lessons
is that while a good name is more to be desired than riches, it is
a whole lot more valuable if the majority of the people know just what
the< name is.

ME-OWS OF A KITTYnot make out what was said for* the
buzzing In his ears, but the door did
not open. A few feet away the soft,
gray nose of Billy, the mule, rose above
the water. Swanson reached out and
touched it with- dripping fingers. There
was a beseeching look in the dumb
eyes, as if the mule knew that he could
not last much longer. Swanson said
nothing. There was a strange likeness
between the man and the brute: both
were slow, dull, powerful of body, with
the" patience that outwears suffering,
and the dumb, uncomplaining faith
which goes down to death without a
quiver. Neither made an outcry; hav
ing done all that was possible they
waited. Swanson's eyes presently be
gan to fall him, the lights grew dim,
but he still held Jernigan's head above
the water.
All this time the great pumps above
ground were drawing to their utmost
on the flood, and the engines were driv

ings, though those outside had little
hope of rescuing the entombed' men.
And yet, what . human hands were so
weak in doing, blind circumstance had
already accomplished, for . the terriflc
inrush of water at the tunnel's - end
had brought with it great quantities
of sand, 1 clay and bowlders, which soon
filled the tunnel for; many feet. ' and
finally choked the break, so that water
could not; longer enter. ...
The tunnel had overreached itself, in
its Â¦ treachery, and now, slowly, the
pumps and the compressors began to

two weeks later Jernigan and Swan

They forced Swanson to his feet,
dosed him with black coffee, and walked
him up and down the room, though he
groaned with pain and begged them
to let him sleep.
Jernigan came to himself first la the
hot room. He was not able to get ut>

opened his eyes he said, in strange
contrast to his usual comments:

which was icy cold to his half naisd
body, leave his shoulders, then creep
down his breast. He was leaning now
against the wall, still holding Jernigan
up. Presently, though he fought
against It, he sank to his knees, and
thus they found him, with the mule's
gray nose resting on his shoulder.
They dragged the two men into the
air-lock, followed by a rush of water.
Both were unconscious. Billy tried to
follow, but they pushed him back, and
when the door was closed he still stood
there patiently, waiting with faith the
rough kindness of his masters. Ha
had known all along that the door
some way, some time, would open; had
it "not always opened before?
Â¦ â¢
Instantly there came the gurgling of
escaping air, then a wild inrushing tor*
rent of mud and water.
Swanson ran, at first with the sub
boss in his arms, the water surging
about his legs. But he was soon so
hampered that he drew' Jernigan's
shoulders under his arm, and -then
rushed on again, dragging his burden.
The heavy air roared in his ears and he
choked with the thumping of his heart.
He had already been under pressure
longer than the usual time. And still
he waded, -the water now up to his
waist. He held Jernigan's head above
the flood.
Thus he came . to the air-lock and
pounded on the steel door. He knew
that there was not one chance in a
thousand that ony one would dare to
open it, for the water was already
above the upper frame. There, too,
had come Billy, the tunnel-mule, drag
ging his empty car behind him. He
had not~hurrled, though he realized
that something was wrong, and he
now stood with quiet patience, his nose
close-pressed to the steel door; it had
always opened. to him before; he had
faith to believe it would open now. ;
Although sore pressed, Swanson
stroked the mule's rough neck, then
bent his shoulder into the water and
unhooked the harness traces. He ; felt
that there was no chance for "any of
them, but he - wanted to give Billy tin
equal opportunity to fight for, his life.

Swanson removed his hand from
Jernigan's body, for the air pressure
now supported him firmly in place.
More clay was brought and plugged in
around Jernigan's body, and presently
the tunnel no "longer grumbled.
"Now, Swanson/' said Jernigan. "you
go up and get those men out here."- He
said other things about . his i crew, not
necessary to set down in this place.
Swanson started promptly, but he
had not gone far when he heard Jerni

"Give it to her, Swanson," Bald Jer
nigan cheerfully, although his face was
twisted with the pain of his position.
Swanson worked furiously, with the
water rising about his legs. The other
workmen were already safe in the air
lock. ? The dim tunnel seemed like a
long pathway of water, for the roadway
was now completely covered. For a
time it seemed an even chance against
the^ incoming water; then with Swan

And then came the blue Monday. It
was at the afternoon shift. The tun

mirable decorum for a day or .two,
the earth had seemed . much harder,
and though there was frequent, rat
tling of escaping air â the sound, of
which had grown so familiar that It
brought not a tremor to the menâ
the gaps were more easily closed.
Swanson had accumulated a large
stock of clay balls.
"Ye're getting fat and lazy, Swan
son," Jernigan said; "the old lady ain't
playin* her chunes any more."
But Jernigan spoke too soon. Not
ten minutes later one of the Italians
sprang back with a shout; he had
opened a little pocket of silt near the
top and at one side of the tunnel's
end. For t a moment the soft earth
gushed out,' then there was the walling
sound of escaping air. Instantly Swan
son drove a clay ball Into the hole, but
instead of remaining there It dis
appeared at once, being driven upward
by the escaping air. Other balls fol
lowed in like manner; the air was going
fast. Half the crew were throwing the
clay, but It either went out of sight
or sloughed down with the Incoming
mud. Then of a sudden in gushed a
torrent of vrater as big as a man's
leg. Jernigan rang for more air pres
sure and the men redoubled their
efforts, but all to no avail. Suddenly,
while Jernigan himself was working
at the breach, the Italians bolted. Jer
nigan yelled at them, but they were
too desperately frightened and ran at
the top of their speed for the air-lock.
The other men* paused undecided for an
Instant, and then they, too, followed.
It seemed certain death to remain with
that stream of water pouring -into the
tunnel. It would . require only a mo
ment to wear a larger hole, and then
the whole river would be in on themâ
and there was nearly 600 feet of 1 tin
ning water to the air-lock and safety.
Jernigan looked around. Only Swan
son was left, calmly yet swiftly gather-
Ing, up more clay balls.
For an Instant the two men looked
at each other. Jernigan had promised
to see the work through, and see It
through he would, water or no water.
Swanson saw him spring suddenly upon
the low earth bank which the men
used when working around the upper
rim of the tunnel. He turned swiftly,
and braced himself. into the mud of the
tunnel's end, driving his body into the
pocket of quicksand.
"Here, Swanson, plug me In," he or
dered. MtefaBWfcMpMHpMBBJsgBMi
Meantime Swanson, in his slow way,
was coolly pitching clay balls. Two
other men, with Jernigan, joined "i im,
and at last, with the water cold about
their ankles, they succeeded in stop
ping the flow. It was after this incident
that the Committee of Five came to
look at the tunnel, for such things as
these leak curiously out to the public,
and the committee, as I havo said,
found it a good and perfect tunnel,
and Mr. Barclay an amiable man. Ear
clay was no longer congratulating l.lm
eelf. In two weeks the tunnel had not
advanced three feet, and it was cost
ing him a small fortune to keep the
water down. [";'.- Â».V:
He caught one Italian with a blow
on the chin that sent him sprawling
into the water: the second paused, and
Jernigan leaped at him and drove him
headlong against the earth at the tun
nel's end.
fluid silt. So much water came in that It
ran in a stream under the plank road*
way, and the great pumps at the shaft
head worked to full capacity. Once
they thought the whole tunnel end was
coming in; the water gushed inward,
rose rapidly above the roadway and
swirled cold about their feet. Two
Italians bolted suddenly from the earth
working to escape; even Paddock
dropped his shovel. Jernigan stood Hko
a post.
"Get back there!" he roared.
When Tunnel Three began to grum
ble it was beautiful to see Jernigan
hold his men In hand. At the first
sound of danger there were those who
would have gone rushing for the air
lock and safety, but Jernigan, standing
there- behind them in the roadway, was
more terrible than the danger in front.
Of 'all the sounds known to theso un
derground places there Is none quite
like toe grumbling at a tunnel's end.
It comes often with explosive sudden
ness, like the snapping and rattling of
steam In lor.fr pipes, though often muf
fled, and then it Is choked off and dies
away In a gurgle. And sometimes the
sound more resembles a long-drawn
Â¦wall or whistle, as a man would blow
sharply across the mouth of a bottle,
this followed with sharp rapping and
cracking â and then a gush of muddy
water that makes a man's heart dot
and carry one.
And yet, sudden and startling as
these sounds at a tunnel's end may be,
they are nothing of themselves; their
terror lies in their significance; they
are the outcries of danger. The tun
nel grumbles when it reaches a spot
Â¦where the earth between it and the
â¢water of the river bottom Is thin, where
there are pockets of quicksand or d'eeps
of thick mud. Its excuse for grumbling
is the best. The heavily compressed air
within the tunnel, thus compressed for
thÂ«! main purpose of keeping out water
and mud from the tunnel's end, breaks
out through the thin earth where the
znen are working, with a ripping wall,
end goes boiling upward to the surface
cf the river. And when it escapes the
water and thin mud bursts In, and if
enough air goes out and enough water
comes in it Is ninety-nine chances to
one that the workers, racing for the
airlock, will be overtaken and drowned
with their noses to the roof of the tun
nel like rats in a rain barrel.

"She's a thundering geeser."
In the cold â¢ ooze at the end of the
tunnel, where the truth was, gaunt,
half-dad men. with picks and clay
plugging bulls, said things about the
tunnel that would not look well in
print, and, being men of experience in
these things, they spoke with authority.
So bad was the reputation of the tan
ziel among those who knew that no boss
but Jernigan could have kept a crew
at work, where every pick thrust was
a special invitation to death by drown

So the Five went up with the hazy
impression that tunnels were generally
moist and uncomfortable, if not dan
gerous, 2nd that Mr. Barclay was a
remarkably eminent contractor and an
accomplished engineer, to say nothing
of being a genial good fellow. They
reported that the tunnel was a good

complimentary t^rms to the contractor,
thereby relieving the fears of a solici

jack from a pressure nozzle, however.
it had not occurred to the Five to in
quire why the water roared under the
plonk roadway on which they had
walked, nor why the heavy air shook
co constantly with the muffled thunder
of great pumps. They had not even
seen the half- naked men of the deep
workings come out of the air-lock wet
from too to toe with blue mud and
shivering with cold.
It is a curious fact that the deeper

Its reputation. The Five had not been
permitted to catch so much as a glimpse
of Jernigan. the sub-boss, lord of the
pressure workings. If Jernigan's opin
ion of the tunnel had been asked he
would have answered frankly, being
an outspoken man:
Having now nearly reached the steel
door of the air-lock, Barclay invited
them to enter the pressure workings,
whera twenty men and a mule were
toiling, but the chairman remembered
Buddenly that he had a weak heart
and couldn't take air-pressure, and the
others were certain that, having just
dined heartily, it would be very dan
gerous for them to venture. Barclay
looked relieved at this decision; Greg
son's face was grim, and he said noth
ing.
THERE was a curious diversity of
opinion about Tunnel Three.
Barclay, the contractor, who had
a little shanty of an office at the
top of the shaft, with blue-print plans
on the wall3 and a stovepipe crooking
out of one conifer of the roof, said it
was a beautiful tunnel. He said it with
cheerful confidence to the Committee
of Five who had come to investigate.
The five had just dined expansively
(with Barclay) and it was with good
humored brcvado that they now trusted
themselves to the dinky elevator and
descended the shaft- Sixty feet below

platform, and Gregson, the underground
boss, showed them a moist red tube
reaching outward under the river. A
row of rr.'.sty incandescent lights ribbed
tlie tunnel at regular intervals with cir
clets of brightness, and at the far end
they could see a blade wall with a
closed steel door. For the benefit of
:he chairman cl' ths Five, who thought
that this wall was the end of the tun
nel. Gregson explained 'that the steel
door led into the air-lock, and that for
C09 ffÂ»et beyond stretched the pressure
workings. Gregson confined himself
strictly to information; he ventured no
opinion at all. as became a wise boss
la the presence of the contractor. The
Five walked down the plank roadway
en the floor of the red tube, their heads
almost touching the roof, the water
dripping on their oil coats, their ears
filled with the sirange echoes of this
underground place.
"You are now under the river," Bar
clay said; "the water is not twenty-five
feet over your heads."
The Five looked at one another.
"Is there any danger?" asked the
chairman.
"Not the slightest, " answered Bar
clay.
A email, cold rivulet dripped down
inside the chairman's collar.
"Let's go up." he said.
Swanson was already on his feet
with his arms full of the clay balls,
and he and three of the other men be
gan throwing them swiftly and vigor
ously at the spot where' the air was
escaping. Each flattened out near the
tunnel rim like a thick corn cake, and
when the rattling ceased Swanson
sprang into the mud and purnmeled the
clay into the break. ' The heavy air in
the tunnel helped to hold the patch in
place. Then the work went on again,
the Italians picking and shoveling,
Billy, the tram mule, flapping his long
ears, Swanson soberly patting mud pel
lets, and -Jernigan directing everything;
with cheerful unconcern. Once more
during the shift. the tunnel grumbled,
once more there was a battery of clay
balls, and once more the men won the
victory against the water.
"Ye're a pretty pitcher, Monty,"
Ehouted Jernigan; "why don't you
throw over the home plate? Here,
Swanson, you Swede, climb up there
and paddle."
At the end of three hours of the
heavy air and the heavier work the
men returned to the air-lock, suffered
again the pain of reducing pressure,
and went Into free air, wet and shiver
ing with cold. They were taken In
stantly to a hot room, where they were
given quantities of steaming; black
coffee, and after that they dropped
down to sleep. Two shifts a day, three
hours or less each, was all these men
could stand. -
Thus day after day Jernigan kept
his crew burrowing, though the tunnel
grumbled , Its displeasure , almost con
stantly, and the earth came down half
ran as straight and shiny as a run
barrel, the men at the end driving
their way comfortably through hard
ear.d and clay, with here and there
a boulder, and not a thought of tha
vessels plying back and forth sixty
feet over their heads. Behind cam*
the brickers building the tunnel wall
(for the brick tube was always kept
complete within a few feet of the tun
nel's end), the pipemen with their
wrenches, and the electricians adding
light after light to the long row at the
tunnel roof. Barclay rubbed his handa
with glee, thinking of his profits, and
Gregson lay by and let Jernigan do
the work, it was tunnel building ao
cording to the books.
But one day the Swede, Swanson,
driving his pick for a shovelful of sand,
brought down a cart load. Where the
earth lay bare underneath It glistened
with tiny rivulets of water, and pres
ently the sand began to slough dowr;
noiselessly, loosening more and more,
growing more fluid. All of the men
sprang to the end of the plank road
way. An Italian who went by the
name of Macaroni â for the sake of uni
formity â yelled lustily for Jernigan.
"What you squallin' for?" demanded
the sub-bos3; "it's only a pocket of
quicksand.'
That was Jernigan's way â "only
quicksand" â but it was to be observed'
that even Jcrnigan stepped more quick
ly. The little rivulets became streams,
and the blue silty sand spread further
out in the tunnel. â¢,
Up to that time the air lock had not
been used, but now the men rushed
from the deep workings, the inner steel
door of the lock was clapped shut, and
the compressed air was turned in. With
a depth of sixty feet it was necessary
to use a pressure of over thirty pounds
to the scuare inch (two atmospheres),
in order to make the pressure of air
within the tunnel equal to the pressure
of earth and water without, thereby
tending to keep the soft earth at the
tunnel's end from caving in. From a
comparatively comfortable place to
work in the tunnel beyond the air lock
became a hot, misty hole, the heavy at
mosphere of which was almost certain,
sooner or later, to bring paralysis to
its victims, with that more terrible air
pressure disease known as the "bends."
"New, byes," said Jernigan, "we'll
swaller air."
Twenty men crowded into the lock
and the outer steel door was closed.
Jernigan turned a valve, and the air
came hissing in, the men held their
noses, blew into their cheeks, swallow
ed lustily with nothing to swallow, that
they might equalize the pressure inside
their bodies with that without. Terri
bly sharp pains shot through their
heads, and sometimes it seemed as
though their ear drums must burst. But
at last the limit of pressure was reach
ed, and the pain gradually passed away.
The door leading to the pressure work
ings was opened and in they went.
Jernigan's men were all young and
sound. None other can bear the strain
and fatigue of this most wearing of
toIL The tunnel had grown misty, so
that the lights shone through haloes
of haze, and the compression of thÂ«j
air had generated so much heat that
the men began to strip. Jernigan's
voice sounded thin and high in the
thick air; it was an effort to speak
aloud. Paddock, who was an inveter
ate whistler, could not blow a sound.
"She's stopped slobberin'," remarked
Jernigan as they reached the tunnel's
end. Most of the men began digging
cautiously and shoveling the mud into
the tramcars; Swanson, the Swede, sat
at one side and industriously made
small round balls of clay, a little larger
than croquet balls. It seemed like child's
work, and Jernigan kept up a steady
stream of raillery at the expense of
the big Swede.
Swanson could have put. his big flat
thumb on Jernigan and smashed him
and done with it, for he was so tall
he couldn't stand straight on the road
way of the tunnel without hitting his
head â a huge hulk of a man, tow
headed, blue-eyed, slow of speech, faith
ful. He called the sub-boss always
"Meester Yernigan"; Jernigan had at
least twenty names for him, and not
one of them at all complimentary.
And yet no dog ever served a master
more faithfully the Swanson served
the sub-boss.
And, suddenly, as they worked, the
tunnel began to grumble, and" there
was Jernigan barring the passageway
to safety like a rock.
"Give it to her, byes," hÂ» shouted.
THE SAN â¢ FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL'.
AT THE TUNNEL'S ENDStay here and, make It true."
She shook her head half sadly.
"You don't like it here.* You
couldn't make the sacrifice â "
"It isn't that. I do like 1L I like
everything about it. I never felt so
near the sky before â never before so
realized the warmth and comfort of the
earth. To me the breadth of vision is
fascinating. But my work lies else
where."
"What work?" gravely.
"Why, my workâ my business â my
life workâ"
"I suppose you mean your writingâ
your editorial workâ"
"Certainly. I have no other."
"We're not going yet," putting out
a detaining hand, "we're going to
watch the sunset and talk about our
house and plan about our wedding. I
don't need to tell you that I love you,
dear."
'Butâ but, you've knovn me only a
month â "
"That's long enough to know that I
love you."
"And I know nothing of yourâ your
antecedentsâ" hesitatingly.
"I haven't any," shortly.
"In New England," slowly, "one's
antecedents count for a good deal."
The man laughed bitterly and then
his face grew, grave.
"Please sit down again, Miss Falrlle;
I foresee a conflict between your East
ern pride and prejudice and my West
ern Independence and intolerance, 1 and
I am not equal to It standing."
She yielded, not unwillingly.
"A man without antecedents â " she
began.
"In this section of God's country,"
he interrupted firmly, "a man stands
for just what he is. No one cares who
his relatives are . if he 'Is 'square and
white,' and does the right thing here.
Never mind my 'antecedents,' Agnes.
Don't you love me?" -.

"It's like a picture gallery,"
aaid Miss Falrl'e softly.
"So It Is." assented the young rancb
. man heartily. "Let's choose pictures,
as the children do. See, there's a beau
tiful maiden robed in whiteâ she's
mine."
"Very well. You saw her first. Look,
there's a houseâ that's mine."
"It's a ranch-house, then," decidedly;
"see how low and spread out It is â
plenty or land, you see."
"It's ail full of nooks and corners,"
dreamily, "and there are broad piazzas
with vines growing all over them."
"Of course," with prompt assent,
"that's the Ideal house for a ranch.
Locfc there. Miss Falrlle! See what Is
comlr.g up to your piazza," as a small
er-cloud rolled up tumultuously.
"That's a horse and rider, Mr. Rob

"Sure. It Is you. Just starting out for
a ride over your ranch! See the veil
on your hat?"
She laughed with almost childish
enjoyment of the child's play at "make

"There's another rider now. Let's
see who- that Is."
They gazed earnestly at the passing
cloud.
'Vfl,' thought bo." cried the man tri
umphantly, "it's me." with a dashing
disregard of grammar, "it's meâ on
Sancho. We're going together over our
ranch."!
The woir.an's hand reached out In
stinctively as if to brush the clouds
away, and the hand was promptly
caught and held in a larger, stronger
one.
"Let's make it true," he whispered
earnestly; "don't go back East again.
"You â " after a pause, "you are not
more than . thirty-five*?" questlonlngly.
"I'm awfully sorry, dear;. but you've
got to cut off ten years. I'll be twen
ty-five- next Thursdayâ"
She gasped,, recoiling. as from a dash
of cold water, /and covered her face
with slender, trembling hands.
"It's a shame, Isn't It, sweetheart?"
coaxingly, "but don't you mind. We
don't" need to hang our , family record

gently, "I believe I can make you

"I wish you'd go away," she plead

The odd, boyish abruptness that had
so often amused her came back again.
"Go away? Not much! I'll stay
right here. I may be of great assist
ance to you in making up your mind."
She sat in troubled silence.
Presently he began speaking again,
low and tenderly. "You have not said
that you love me, Agnes, but I believe
that you do â "
"Iâ I am afraid that I doâ " with
something very like a sob In her

"your brother is well and doing finely

"Do you knowâ all about Jack?" she

"Go. back to your reading. I'm not

She Jumped up and, laying her. hand
on his arm, finished Ingenuously, "You
don't mind my bothering you, do you?
A girlgets so tired of woman talk!
A chat like this is like a plunge in a
cold' stream," and she vanished into
the house' and scurried- to her room,
where she threw a kiss to her image in
the mirror with the remark, "you're
doing well for a beginner,, my. love." Â¦
There was a new note in her voice. It
was at the same tfme a challenge and
an appeal.
As if It were something absolutely
new It came to his mind that glrla

a wave of tenderness for the sex swept
over. him. Still he was .very positive
that he wouldn't have eaten the apple,
and something in the soft, babyish,
yet dependent way in which she looked
at him caused him to explain at great
length why.
"Has talked fifteen minutes by the
clock,'* she was thinking in high glee,
but outwardly- she was all deferential,
honey-sweet attention.
"Did it ever. occur to you," she! asked
blandly, "that the creature who tempt

bottom of everything, as it were, must
be asâ as intricate- as your old engi

"I have always considered Adam
weak â very weak," was his evasive an

At these boastful words a resolution

"You are Mr. Benedict's chauffeur?"
The man "nodded his head and made
a motion as if to raise his cap. The
girl put one toot on the step.
"Yes, I recognized the car. I want
you to take me to Harrington as fast
a* yon 'can mÂ«ik<Â» the machine go â "'
The man t-tirred uneasily.
"But I am meeting some people at
the H:C0 trainâ"
"That makes no difference." said thÂ»
girl, rwecping away his objections with
true feminine finality. "I will answer
to Mr. Benedict for your disobeying or
ders. A woman is dying in that cot
ta;re. To save her life ths doctor must
have certain things from his office In
Harrington, and you must take me for
thtrm."
Tb a road stretched before them,
rmooth and level as asphalt pavement.
No tt-amF were in Fight.
â¢Foster:" cried the girl, fmpatiently.
â¢You tan Eurt-iy make better time than
this!"
â¢Arainst the law," paid the man
cmily.
"V.-ry well, break the law. . 1*11 pay
th" fine if you :ire arrested. Oh. don't
you understand? I've never seen any
ore Cicâ and we've got to get back in
time to save her'.**
Th^ car pprang forward. The girl
closed her .eyes suddenly. She had
never ridden so fast.
"Accident?" hissed the" man's voice
in her ear.
"Yes. She fell and cut herself. I
was driving by in my pony cart when
I heard her groan. It was dreadful. I
had n<*vvr reen blood before, you know.
JuÂ«=t then Dr. U^rron drove along, lie
faid something about an artery and
went to making bandages. Iâ I don't
think I was much goodâ I turned so
faint. Then he wanted to drive back
to Rarrir.gton for tome thingsâ andâ Iâ
I was afraid to stay alone with her. He
wrote the list on a paper, and I was
jurt starting with the pony cart when
I heard your machine. The doctor says
she hns just one chance in a hundred.
You were the chance." ' â¢
The car stopped at the top of the hill.
"Brnre yourself." said the man curt
ly. Then came the plunge downward
It seemed, to. the 'girl' as if the wheels
did not Ftrike the ground as they pass
ed through space. When they reached
the foot of the hill "she realized sud
denly that the chauffeur had been hold
ing her in the car with an arm firm
arA unflinching. He did not apologize
when he removed its support. They
were turning into the village.
"Which â¢street?" he demanded; and
she pointed to a white gabled cottage.
He was evidently a well-trained chauf
feur of a multi-millionaire bachelor. He
knew enough to -<"-. his place and not
to take advantage of an awkward sit
uation. 'Â¦
The doctor's wife followed 'her to tha
car, talking volubly.
"2>ow, don't stay around that place,
fretting your soul out. Miss Carleton.
Th<Â» doctor will get some neighbor to
stay with her."
The car panted up the hill.
"Isn't this dreadful?" asked the girl

WOMEN OF A SPANISH

Children Born of Two Mothers at the

Mixed. ' -
'; MADRID, Sept. 24.â The identity of
two babies which have been born in a
forest near Cabezon. a small town in
Santander province, has to be settled
by a council of the families of both.
While the mothers were taking a
walk in the forest the children . were
bornâ -both being boys. ' A number of
wemen from" a ; neighboring village
who arrived on the scene took mothers
arid babies home on stretchers.
Unfortunately, the "excited women
handed ' the infants from one to the
other and in the confusion that"' fol
lowed it became impossible to distin
guish one child .from the other.
'By way of' temporary arrangement
each Â« of i the , two ; mothers accepted* a
baby without troubling herself as
to whether it was her own or not.
The families of the two women have
decided t6 hold a; joint I meeting,"* at
which efforts will be made Uo; identify

'FOSSUM HAS FUN WITH
VICTORIAN PARLIAMENT
Strayed Animal Visits Lawmakers and
Causes Great Amusement and Con- -

MELBOURNE, Victoria, Sept. 24.â
Often political adversaries accuse each
other ; of "playing 'possum," Â¦ but rarely
do legislators of -all parties amuse
themselves with . a -possum. Just this
occurred , in the Victoria State Parlia
ment a few evenings: ago. j
During a dreary debate, a large"'pos
sum, gray enough to be the i Premier of
all the /possums, scampered ; into- the
chamber, Â¦ ran to the {chair : of the, ser
geant at .arms, : sprang into ; it arid "sat
there blinking at y' the V electric lights.
Instantly ; the : lawmakers cast dignity
to itheiwinds and ; with boyish -shouts
of joy "joined in chasing] the 'possum.
The "Speaker, unmindful of ; his robes
arid "... gravity, > laughed heartily, /but,
after i a minute; or two, shocked .by. his
own, levity, "; he : sprang to his feet and
hurried from the chamber-
The 'possum, like all- his kind, was
elusive. Over and under benches went
the yelling members in pursuit of the
quarry. Chairs were overturned, pan
demonium reigned until at last an agile
labor member seized the 'possum's tail
and carried the animal off in triumph.
The Speaker returned, but so great
was the. members* ..'merriment that he
could not restore order and soon ad
journed the sitting.
Lady Campbell Is Versatile.
LONDON, Sept. , 24.â Lady Colin
Campbell, who has written a pfciy in
conjunction with Miss Clo Graves, is
one of the most versatile of English
women. She has written for periodi
cals since her youth, has published a
novel ("Darell Blake") and, besides
being an energetic literary worker, she
has -few^rivals in society in outdoor
sports, belns a, keen Vfisherwoman, a
fine 'horsewoman: and a champion

Returning to his own hotel, he dis
patched a courier, with a note -to Â¦ Prin
cess Militza, saying that having learned

the elderly lady at her side. The
Grand Duke determined not to lose
track of her this time and followed
the pair with unremitting vigilance.
They entered one of the most fashion
able hotels and the Grand Duke hur
ried into the .clerk's office to inquire
who they were. His astonishment on
learning that the young lady was
Princess Militza of Montenegro and
the elderly companion her '* lady -in
waiting. Madame de Voievitza, was
unbounded, for it seemed to him. that
the' first part of his dream had come
true in an almost miraculous manner.
He immediately resolved that the'eon
clusion of the dream! should also- be
realized.

of her presence in Paris he desired to
pay his respects to her. He mentioned
the fact that his kinsman, the Czar
Alexander III, -who then occupied the
Russian thronejwas an intimate friend
of her father, Prince Nicholas of Mon-
tenegro, and added that he would be
neglecting his duty, if he failed to call
and make his bow ; to her. - Without
waiting for an answer,. the Grand Duke
donned - his r uniform and drove to the
hotel where Princess Militza was stay
ing. He i found that she realized - all
his expectations and he incurred no
delay in making love to the charming
Montenegrin ; Princess, who soon found
that she .reciprocated his feelings.
r HAPPY EVER AFTERWARD.
Before they left 'Paris they had con-
with an elderly lady as companion and
the Grand Duke turned round to fol
low her at a discreet' distance. Sud
denly he lost sight of the ladles and
though he searched the neighboring
streets diligently he could find no
trace of the fascinating stranger. He
returned to his hotel in despair and
dreamed that the fair stranger turned
out to be a Princess in disguise, whom
he immediately married.
On the following day he caught
sight of the unknown lady in the Bois
de Boulogne, but he was driving with
a friend and had no opportunity of
resuming the chase where he had in
terrupted it on the preceding day. A
day elapsed without his seeing the
girl who occupied his thoughts to the
exclusion of most other subjects, but
on the fourth day he espied her prom-
21 years of age, was also a girl of un
usual attractions and no less than four
Grand Dukes and Princes at the wed

paid, their court to her, but her choice
immediately s fell on Prince George
Romanowsky, fifth Duke of Leuchten
berg, who was a widower and eighteen
years her senior. The Romanowskys
are descended on the â¢ paternal side
from the House of Orleans and on the
maternal from - the Russian imperial
family and they are styled "Imperial
Highnesses." ; - ;;
Having gained the love of the charm-
Ing Montenegrin Princess in opposition
to three young and formidable rivals.
Prince George Romanowsky was* in a
great hurry to marry her, and he
rushed, the preparations regardless of
court etiquette and precedents. Exactly
one month after the wedding of Prin

and five weeks after he had seen her

A pretty English girl staying at the
house not long ago, on going upstairs
in evening dress after dinner, stopped
near one of the landing windows to
look out on the park. Suddenly a
brilliant light illumined the drive and
to her horrer the figure of a young
woman, all in flames, bearing a child
in her arms, appeared tearing down
the avenue. The girl nearly fainted
Â¦with fright and Defore she was able
to call assistance and have the facU

The second Surrenden horror hap
pened on j" the same occasion, .and
probably sprang from the excitement
caused by the accounts of her felloe
visitor's delusion. A lady of a highly
nervous temperament sleeping in one
of the' fine bedrooms at the back of
the house woke in terror about 2
o'clock in the morning, feeling a3 if
she were half strangled by a pair of
sharp-clawed hands entwined around
her throat. At length she managed to
give one or two inarticulate cries,
which attracted the attention of her
maid, who flew to her aid. to find her
mistress half dead, lying across the
bed.
The interior of the house is beau

GHOST STORIES CAUSE
SHIVERS IN SOCIETY
Shortly after New Year's day. in
1S89 the Grand Duke Peter Xichol
aievitch of Russia, a cousin of the
Czar, was paying a visit to Paris. He
was then dt the impressionable age of
25 and on the boulevards one day his
eye- was attracted by a young lady
Â¦whose style of beauty was something
out of the common, she was walking
While thus enjoying childhood to
the full the royal girls were educated
by French and German tutors and
g-overnesses, who polished off the
roughness which might otherwise
have become apparent in their char
acters. Prince Nicholas allowed each
of his datighters to run wild in Mon
tenegro until 16 years of age, after
which the Princesses were sent to Vi
enna and Paris to grain a knowledge
of the western world with its totally
different manners and customs. After
attaining her seventeenth birthday
each Princess spent six months of the
year abroad and six months In Mon
tenegro and this plan proved to be an
effective education. The Montenegro
Princesses developed from tomboy
girls into women of unusual grace and
beauty, of exceptional personal dis
tinction and of remarkable talent In
many directions.
In these delightful surroundings the
Princesses of Montenegro grew up to
be splendid specimens of womanhood.
As children they enjoyed the greatest
liberty and escaped the restraints of
court etiquette, which are the curse
of most royal boys and girls. In the
severe winters which are experienced
in the country of the black hills, as
Montenegro is called in the Balkans,
the Princesses were encouraged to
harden their constitutions^ by sleigh
ing, running in snow shoes, skating
and indulging in other cold weather
sports and pastimes. At the warmer
seasons of the year they made long
excursions into the wooded and moun
tainous interior and paid frequent vis
its to the Prince's villa on the shore
of the Adriatic Sea. By the time they
were In their teens they could ride a
bareback horse, drive a four-in-hand,
hunt and shoot, swim and sail or row
a boat to perfection.
i:\.TOV GREAT LIBERTY.
The Prince's partner in the owner
ship of the Grand Hotel, who man
ages that establishment, is also Min
ister'cf Commerce and has a seat In
the Montenegrin Cabinet. The Min
ister of Foreign Affairs goes about the
streets of the capital in the pictur
esque native costume of many colors
with two huge revolvers stuck Into his
belt, and a recent visitor to Cettinje
found the Minister of War sweeping
the floor of the arsenal in which
Montenegro's artillery is stored.
There are no railways in Monte
negro and the majority of the people
tan neither read nor write. On the
other hand, although some of the rea
tures of Western civilization are want
ing, Montenegro is almost free from
both drunkenness and gambling.
Prince Nicholas, in his benevolent
absolutism, has decreed that an>
Montenegrin found drunk shall be de
prived of his right of carrying arms,
this being the most humiliating pun
ishment that can be inflicted on these
Balkan warriors. A severe penalty Is
also imposed on those found gambling.
Conditions of life in Montenegro are
primitive in the extreme. The reign
ir.p Prince is more of an absolute
ruler than the Czar of Russia and at
convenient intervals he erects a trib
unal under an immense tree in front
of his palace and there administers
justice to his subjects in partriarchal
style. The Prince's income from the
public exchequer does not suffice to
fuprb' his needs and he supplements
it in various ways. He lets out the
royal horses on hire to drag loads
from the two Montenegrin ports to
the interior, is part proprietor of the
Grand Hotel at Cettinje and possesses
the monoply of picture postcards in
his country.
BERLIN*. Sept. 24. â "Sire, I have
noticed that Montenegro has no ex
ports," once remarked a distinguished
foreign traveler to Prince Nicholas.
"Monsieur," replied the reigning
monarch of- Montenegro, "you forget
my daughters."
The retort vras justified, for queer
little Montenegro has supplied two
tnonarchs end three other important
royal personages with -wives. One
Montenegrin Princess is the present
Queen of Italy and another now would
be Queen of Servia but for her pre
mature death, while three other
daughters of Prince Nicholas are the
Grand Duchess Militza of Russia, the
Duchess Anastasia of Leuchtenberg
iind Princess Anna of Battenberg re
spectively.
The number of brideS which
Montenegro has supplied to the courts
of Europe is altogether disproportion
ate to the size and importance of the
little country. MontcnegTO has an
area of S500 square miles and, a ppou
lr.tion of a quarter of a million. The
capital, Cettinje, is a village with a
population of 3000. The princely pal
cce in which so many distinguished
royal brides were born and brought up
is a modest structure in which a mod
erately successful American trades
man would never condescend to dwell.

tracted a secret engagement and parted
with mutual promises to obtain their
respective sovereign's assent* to the
match. The Grand Duke Peter re
turned to St. Petersburg and formally
asked for the Czar's permission to
propose for the hand of the Princess
Milifza of Montenegro, which was
readily given, for this love match ex
actly suited the Vequirements of Rus
sia's foreign policy. When the Grand
Duke arrived at Cettijne three weeks
later to ask Prince Nicholas for the
hand of his eldest daughter, he found
the ground prepared and the course of
true love ran with wonderful smooth
ness. The marriage was celebrated in
St. Petersburg within six months of the
day; on which the Grand Duke first
caught sight of his bride and the im
perial couple have lived happily ever
since. , Grand Duchess Militza, who is
now the mother of a son and two
daughters, has been one of the most
popular members of the Russian im
perial family during all the fiften years
of her married life.

CAPTURES A FUTURE KING.
Princess Helene of Montenegro was
destined to make a still better match.
In the spring of 1S96 Crown Prince Vic
tor Emmanuel of Italy visited Monte
negro for a hunting expedition and was
the guest of Prince Nicholas. When he
went out shooting he found, to his sur
prise, that he was accompanied not
only by Prince Nicholas and his two
elder sons. Crown Prince Danilo and
Prince Mlrko, but also by his daugh
ter, Princess Helene, then a girl of 23
years. Moreover, he found that at the
end of the day Princess Helene had se
cured a bigger bag than his ownâ a cir
cumstance that increased his admira
tion for the royal amazon.
When he found that, notwithstanding
this proficiency in manly pastimes.
Princess Helene was gentle and domes
ticated, a talented painter and a musi
cian of real power, the Italian Crown
Prince fell in love with her and asked
Prince Nicholas for her hand within a
week of his arrival In Montenegro.
Prince Nicholas naturally raised no ob
jections, the King of Italy approved his
son's choice and the match was pro
nounced satisfactory by Italian states
men, so that there were no obstacles,
and the wedding took place in Rome a
few months later. Four years later
Princess Helene became Queen of Italy
through the assassination of her father
in-law, King Humbert, by an anarch
ist. Her marriage, too, has been ex
tremely happy, only the birth of two
successive daughters Instead of the de
sired son has been a disappointment to
the royal parents.
- At .the wedding of the Queen of Italy
her younger sister, Princess Anna, act
ed as chief bridesmaid, and among the
royal guests present i,was Prince Fran
cis Joseph of Battenberg. The romance
enacted in St. Petersburg was repeated,
and Prince Francis Joseph fell In love
with Princess Anna, whom he married
six months later. Prince Nicholas of
Montenegro's eldest daughter. Princess

before he ascended the thfone of Servia

â¢ Mine. Melba has been singing into
a recording machine for the benefit of
the -British public of years to come,
and' Mr. Blackburn, the able critic of
the '.Pall Mall j Gazette, was provoked
thereby .to. this outburst: , ;
"Above ;all â¢ the singers now before
the jiublic -Mme. - Melba seems to rise
sup'erior,, in.- the matter . of absolute
phrasing.^That.; which phrasing in
the vocal, art 'really means is the clear
understanding- of tempo- -combined
with a sort, of undulatory knowledge
of the 'precise' swing of the music
which- originally occupied the com
poser's -braki,- but which at the same
time : is- not * exactly subject to strict
law.'"-- As- a "rule ~ Melba's attention to
time is one -of- her most finished qual
ities,,", but -where a composer allows a
certain amount r of â¢tempo rubato, she
takes admirable advantage of the fact
and thus by a sort of twist the tem
perament makes'you at the same time
thoroughly understand. her, originality.
Herein ..lfes.Vas I have hinted, to a
great;.extent the; beauty of her phras
ing, '.inasmuch, as it is supported at all
times, by contrast, in' her ? personality
compared^ to^the steady \ and effectual
beauty, of heir voice. She never allows
you to' forget by any piece', of Â¦ coarsely
dramatized " phrasing the sheer vocal
value: of her. production," and at the
same time she "never allows, you to
feel . that she phrases monotonously,
because, .like the' festival days of the
year/.her manner . (in Shakespeare's
phrase)" always, delivers up to you
'The "captain" jewels 'of the carcanet.*
"Onerof Melba's most extraordinary
gifts- is her'capacity for instantly real
izing the. right pitch of any phrase in
any song. With many singers, who are
admittedly quite, at the head of their
profession,* there is a certain amount of
difficulty' in wheeling through the great
open spaces of the scale; -thus to fly
from j E ,' flat * in : the lower -. register to
B flat in the : higher soprano register
with perfect -ease .'is 'â¢ naturally not at
alia -matter to be lightly.' undertaken.
That â¢famous -vocal 'device' which is
known by the Italians as .'portamento*
never enters 'Into' any' of- Melba's ef-'
fects; she never knows what it is to
reel from note to note with the Inter
space of : , endless ' quarter tones, but
with a wonderful command of ear' she
rises 'from' point to. point without any
interval :. of ; what^ may' be called the
compromise of Â¦difficulties." It is here
that her musical '.'attacco,' as the Itali
ans/have'known It, is "so' extraordinary
and..in, these/days Is. so Incomparable.
It may^be just possibly" urged, as'some
have 'said, .that a all ; : these things come

"But Savage is ready when you are?"
"I think so," the Californian said.
"Savage is a fine fellow. He doesn't
know everything about music by any
means, but he knows what he likes and
takes you if he does like you, right on
the spot. There's no make believe writ
ing your name in a book and telling
you to come round again in a week
or two. He's yes or no. Those Thurs
day tryouts in New York! They're
frightful. Hordes of applicants wait
ing on the managers. You sing. They
don't listen. They whistle. The ac
companist stops. They pretend to put
your name in a book. They tell you to
come round again in a week or two.
You know they mean nothing. They
know you know they mean nothing.
Yet the miserable stream goes on. It's
going yet. The trouble is," and the
singer stopped his dramatic recital to
slap the arm of his chair . for empha
sisâ"the trouble is that the managers
don't know. They prefer to take the
bad, . old person 'with a name to risk
ing anything on their judgment; They
are wise usually^ for they haven't any."
"But the Tivoli came to you," I in
terrupted.
"Now, am I to say the Tivoli knows
â " laughed their latest recruit, and as
he told me again how happy he was
going to be over his successful debut
when he was less tired, when the beam
was out of his eye, when the terror of
the thing had left him, when this and
that and the other happened, I bade
him good day.
After his triumphant debut at the
Tivoli the evening before, I think I
rather expected to find Andrew Bogart
last Monday with laurels "in his hair."
I had seen operatic debuts before, from
that of the chorus graduate stepping
lightly into the center of the stage to
that of the amateur paying for profes
sional prominence. But I had not be
fore seen an amateur youngster walk
away with first-night honors in the as
tonishing fashion of Andrew Bogart.
There was not a trace of nerves In
his Lopezâ "The Serenade" was the
opera- There was only the Intended
tremolo in the voice; only the needful
end graceful gesture. The singer
climbed down the stage Alps, wore his
ribbons and gaiters, sang and made
love to the eoubrette as if he had
been born to the work. And I won
dered as I watched him if his com
posure were skin deep or deeper. I won
dered if I had seen in his debut the
gratification of a cherished ambition. I
wondered again if I had witnessed in it
one of those happy and peculiar acci
dents that forever change, a career. In
any case I expected to find a very well
pleased young man when I went to see
him. For had not public and critics
hailed in Andrew Bogart another fame
ordained Calif ornian?
It was. however, a boyishly sleepy
rather than a rampantly gratified per
son that met me in the handsome Bo
part study, where I had elected to chat.
He was bravely fighting yawns and a
piece of the Tivoli that dropped into
his eye the night before, and that every
Bngart from the cook upâ the singer is
Ftill at home in the paternal mansion
had since been trying to extract. He
had- been awake all night. He had been
at rehearsal all morning. He had been
rehearsing most of Sunday. And he
was tremendously â as Ethel Barrymore
likes to say â nervous the night before.
He told me these things as I congratu
lated him on his triumphs and asked
how it felt, and then we sat down on
pome of- the handsome weathered oak
that adorns the place.
Just as young off the stage as on the
Finger looks, and he has looked the
same for years. But for a slight gray
ing of the stubborn hair, worn a little
long, I see no change in Andrew Bo
part from the "boy barytone" that as
tfinished local audiences years ago. It
was the same cherubic face, rosy
skinned, between round and square,
liright brown-eyed, that the singer
turned to me as that that looked out
from* among the girls of the Saturday
Morning Orchestra when he made his
debut. It was, by the way, at the Grand
Opera-house, just before that historic
place became Morocco's Own and Mr.
Rosewald conducted. Perhaps there is
an added youthful portliness to the
pood in the Bogart make-up, but he is
not grown up by years yet. Simple and
modest, boyish, too, is the fashion of
his speech, and it was thus he naively
confessed that debuts, even successful,
were not as beautiful as they looked.
"What bothered you most?" I askeci
him.
Without sn instant's hesitation he
put up hi? hands â looking at them as
though he had just been introduced to
them, and said: "Oh, those hands!
You knowâ I couldn't see' anything
last night but my hands, moving fool
ishly this way and that. They were
simply too absurd for ariything."
"You were the only person in the
theater that thought .so," I assured
him, and reiterated my surprise at the
professional aplomb of his gesture.
"Miss Condon was good enough to
tell me â they were all so stunningly
kind down there â that I was more
graceful than some professionals," the
Finger recalled, smiling a little. He
threw off some of the tiredness in the
laugh with which he added: "I shall
ask her to-night how she dare call me
an amateur: â and I was an amateur
last night at quarter to' 8"â naively.
"Tell me just how4t feels to be made
into a professional," I requested.
How did it come about?" I asked
"Oh, you don't know what the feel
ing is unlil you have been there," the
Eingrer said, and shivered comfort
ably. "You shake like a leafâ at least
I did. My handsâ oh the hands!â were
like ice. My feet. too. My fashâ I'll
have the blooming thing pinned on to
night â was coming off. I was afraid
of catching my foot in the rocksâ I
went fiat at one of the^rehearsals.
Miss de Fillippe â she was just as nerv
ous as I wasâ forgot a locket that. we
had rehearsed a lot of business with.
J didn't know what to do then. And,
you cannot imagine how strange it is
to talk so loudly. Why, I never yelled
so in my life. It seems to put every
thing out <)f proportion. You talk to
a person a foot away from you as
though he were two blocks off. But it's
over now. The worst Is over. And" â
boyishly proud and happy was the tone
here, "I'm tickled to death to have
made my debut in my own town, and
at the Tivoli."
"Just happened," the singer replied.
"Mr. Strine came after me. I really
tried to get out of itâ and grot in. Not
that I did not want to do the work
you know, but"â but with delightful
naivete â "I was afraid. They came for
me before to take Arthur Cunning
ham's place â "
"By the way," I interrupted, "just
what do you call yourself, Mr. Bogart?
Here you are being in\-ited to take a
barytone's place, singing a tenor part
this week, taking Ligh A's. and talking
barytone!"
ThÂ« "Californian tenor," as he is
biilboarded. laughed as he confided
that he is "just between. I was a bary
tone, of course, but the voice went
up." '
"And is still going up," I added, re
membering a Bosart concert of not so
long ago with a pure barytonal pro
gramme.
"I think so," he agreed.
I reminded him then that we had
had one "De Reszke of light opera" at
the Tivoli. the basso, John Duns
mure, and suggested that we were
perhaps going now to have the other.
"Yes." he recalled, with a twinkle
In- his merry brown eyes, "Jean was a
barytone once, "wasn't he? There'3
every hope for me!"
"You began splendidly last night
He exclaimed then, standing up to
it, shaking back his head and squar
ing his broad shoulders: "Honestly,
I'm proud to have made a hit at the
Tivoli. It counts. If you make a hit
there you can get anything in New
York, for example. And even in
London, Paris and Berlin they ask
"What of the Tivoli?' Then I'm
very glad to have appeared first in my
own town â my own town."
"You were taught here, too, weren't
Â¦you?"
"Indeed I was. I'm entirely Ameri
can-taught," Mr. Bogart subscribed â
"that is, with the exception of five or
six lessons I had from William Shake
speare in London. Francis Stewart
taught me all I know. I studied with
him both here and in New York."
"You didn't like Shakespeare, evi-
dentTy?"
"Not much," the Binger confessed
frankly. "But everybody was talking
about him then â It was the fad â and
I thought I'd try him. He was quite
kind, told me I could go right ahead
then and make a success. But im
agine!" '
Mr. Bogart's Judgment of Mr.
Shakespeare is evidently not of the
most respectful.
"So you don't pose as a C\akespeare
pupil?" I asked.
"Hardly; but" â he laughed â "I
could tell you amusing things of some
people that do. I asked Shakespeare
once about a local contralto here who
went to London and returned, adver
tising herself as his pupil. Shake
speare said: 'Let . me see'â tapping
his brow â 'let me see. Yes, I think
I did have some one of that name.
Ah, yes. She took one lesson. Oh,
yes â and I think she owes me for
that!' "
He dilated then upon the defense
lessness of the teacher in such cases
and gossiped freely about his fellow
teachers here, for Andrew Bogart is
on the maestro list. He waxed en
thusiastic, by the way, over one small
pupil of his, only 15 years old, for
whom he prophesies a future with a
big capital. "A high B that would
tear the roof off" is one of her assets,
and one is shortly to have the oppor
tunity of hearing it.
"I wanted to ask." I requested, "if
last night was your actual first appear
ance on the operatic stage?"
"Not quite," the singer replied. He
lounged over to the fireplace, the shelf
of which was decorated with photo
graphs, and took one down. I no
ticed the others as he did so â
charming young women among them.
There were others, by the way,
caught in the fishnet that hung over
the lounge In the distant corner. And
talking of furniture, -a Steinway baby
grand cozily littered with songs filie'd
a comfortable part.
The photograph that Mr. Bogart
handed me was of a ph:rr:p and pleas
ing devil, himself as "His Royal Nibs"
in Shatter Howard's opera of the
name.
"And this wr? the beginning:?" I
queried.
'My first app?*r.a"nce." Tlr. Bosp.rt
bowed. "But it .rs rot my first
chance to appear." fee R<M*d. "f.avage
wanted me. for 'Kir.j Douo.' "
I demurred: "But of r-ours* yc*i did
not want to do that kinl of thing?"
He dissented: "But, of course. I did!
But the blamed part \v;.Â« too liigh."
Then followed a very Interesting little
dissertation on manages and their
Â¦ways, founded on the singer's experi
ences with Henry Savage.
"I made a great mistake with Sav
age," he recalledâ though not at all
ruefully. "I had good luck in meeting
himâ 1*11 tell you a little afterward
about meeting managers â **
"It may come in!" I vouchsafed.
"I met Mr. Savage at Clifford Page's
studioâ there's a great musician for
you," he interrupted himself to say and
repeated, "I call Page a really great
musician. He has done five operas â not
been heard of because the librettos were
poor. But he's landing now and that
will be one more for California! Any
way Savage was looking at one of the
operas at his studio and at Page's ad
vice I just blew in down there. (It was
a little different from waiting one's
turn with fifty or sixty others, as you
have to at Savage's office.) But I sang
for him and he offered me right away
grand opera leads. Funny part of it
was he thought I was a tenor. It was
my own fault. I sang the 'Pagliacci*
prologue and ended up on a big B
flat."
"And then?"
_"Tben I told him I didn't want to go
into grand opera yet awhile," he 'went
on and looked up, youthfully, modest,
to say: "Of course I knew I wasn't
ready for grand opera and shan't be for
years yet. However, it ended there for
a while. Then one day I went to re
mind him of myself. It's rather ter
rible, you know, that office of his â
sometimes maybe fifty waiting appli
cants. But I sent in my card, saying
on it 'this is Andrew Brooke that you
heard sing at Clifford Page's studio.' "
"Andrew Brooke?" I interrogated.
"Oh," the singer blushed, "I took the
name of Brooke when I went to New
Yorkâ thought if I failed none of you
here would be the* wiser. But Savage
sent for me immediately and fired all
the restâ poor things. He asked me:
'Can you pack up and leave New York
to-night? In two weeks,' I want you to
appear in New Orleans with "King
Dodo." That will give you a week to
travel and a week to study.' "
"Rather breathless sort of arrange
ment â "
"He's a breathless sort of person,"
said Mr. Bogart, who is sweetly, maybe
lazily, anything else. "But I couldn't
take the part. It was too high. And I
couldn't make a bluff at the grand
opera if only because you have to be
definitely something, either tenor or
barytone. There isn't a part to fit me,
only maybe that silly> part in .'Lucia.' "
I told him to possess his soul in pa
tience until . the full tenor gamut ar
rived and then asked: "What should
.you like to do?"
In very sober, earnest and in the
deeps of his barytone the singer said:
"I'd like just once to sing 'Pagliacci.'
Parts of it I can sing now, ; but I could
not sustain the thing through. It stays
high up most of the time."
oughly disbelieve such a theory, for no
dogma seems to me to smack so as
suredly of truth as that which pro
claims that great work is never accom
plished save by extraordinary industry.
Sometimes it occurs to me that the
sheer facility with which she is able to
put the fine quality of her
gifts deceives many a critic into sup
posing that this is all easy enough
wÂ«rk. They forget, I imagine, the deep
truth of that famous adage: 'Ars est
celare artem.' "
It seems that another American girl
has captivated London playgoers, this
time Miss Eleanor Robson. who in a
play by a Londoner, - Israel ZangwfU.
'Merely Mary Ann." won an extraodl
nary success this month. //The New
York Herald printed the following ca
blegram concerning the event:
LONDON, Friday.â Never before In
theatrical history did a young
American girl step so completely Into
London's affections as did Miss Elea
nor Robson in "Merely Mary Ann" at
the Duke of York's Theater last night.
Miss Robson's managers wisely muz
zled the press agent and let the young
actress win her way almost unheralded
on the opening night. The result was
a demonstration such as few London
favorites ever received.
There were a few critical moments
during the evening. The London gal
lerylte has a way of making his wants
known that must be fearfully discon
certing to a foreigner. During the
scene where Mary Ann tells the quaint
story of her vigil by her mother's
deathbed there were some howls of
"Speak louder!" Miss Robson's face
flushed, and although the scene was in
a measure spoiled, she held courage
ously to her part. At the end of the
act there was a storm of approval, and
at the end of the play the audience
stood applauding for ten minutes.
Miss Robson had London at her feet.
The Dally Telegraph says: "The
success last night was not Mr. Zans
will's comedy, but its heroine, or
rather the actress who played the
heroine."
"Miss Eleanor Robson. who won all
our hearts," In a similar vein writes
the critic of the Daily News. "The
whole performance was a triumph for
Miss Robson from first to last. Her
impersonation was absolutely above
criticism, and any success which the
play will undoubtedly achlevemust be
attributed largely to her."
The Daily Mail says: "Her success
last night was thoroughly deserved.
She has power, sympathy, a moving
voice and all the gifts that go to tha
making a great emotional actress.
Miss Robson. without the least
doubt, will become the idol of London
playgoers without exception."
The other papers credit the Ameri
can actress with an extraordinary first
night success.
In the audience were Lady Tama Ar
nold, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Lady
Doyle, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Crane,
Professor Ayrton, F. R. S., and Mrs.
Hertba Ayrton, Anthony Hope. Sir
Squire Bancroft, the Earl of Yarmouth,
W. S. Gilbert. Mrs. Madeline Lucetta
Ryley. Baron Ernsthausen and Mrs.
Brown Potter.
The ordinary acting version of
Hamlet Is that prepared for his per
formances by Kemble, and naturally
everything was subordinated to the
leading part. The play was first
printed in 1603, but as the edition is
full of palpable errors and even of ab
surdities, it is supposed to have been
hastily prepared by a piratical pub
lisher eager to take advantage of the
popularity of the drama. In 1604,
just 200 years ago, there was pub
lished the edition that has been the
basis of all subsequent ones and this
so far excels the other that Shakespear
ean scholars think it must have been
issued under the direct supervision
of Shakespeare himself or printed
from his manuscripts. This is the
version that Ben X3reet*s company of
English actors is to present, practi
cally in its entirety, in the Greek thea

When men and women, apparently
Knne, and of ordinary mental equip
ment, spend every volt of their energy
in an endless pursuit of physical
pleasure^ â giving simian dinners, ca
nine luncheons. twenty-four-hour
bridge parties â they ARE gilded fools;
but luckily a benevolent Providence
hn/h given us only a few of this type
and therefore their little set cannot
justly be said to constitute "society."
Then there are the people who sus
jtf-nd themselves from a family tree â
which may be either a sapling or a
Feyuoia â who spend most of their
energy looking up at their ancestors
and singing hymnals to their bones
and cultivating a fine disdain for those
who boast of less noble ancestors. Now,
unless those musty old grandsires left
legacies of heart and brain and gen
eral worth to their descendants, then
ancestry isn't worth a ha'penny â
and thus ancestry alone cannot form
any distinct phase of sociay.
Nor do those who began life as rail
ejilitters or newsboys and latterly ex
panded into corpulence and railway
presidencies constitute society, lest,
indeed, tact and culture and person
ality have made them their own â and
â¢which, by the way, they often fail
to do.
Nor indeed do the purveyors of the
arts or sciences make up the social
life of communities; unless they pos
stss within them # the world-culture
that frees them from bjorishness and
posing â illnesses that often affect real
masters of divine art.
Well, then, if these classes cannot
b*Â» said to constitute society, what,
pray, does?
Why, good friends, 'tis an aggrega
tion of all these classes â the vain
eeekers after pleasure, the descendants
of "first families," the self-made man
and his interesting display of gold, the
'artists and writers and the doers and
the dreamers of the world's work. All
these constitute that complex thing
celled society, wherein there are as
many sub-societies, or sets, as there
are differences in aims, tastes and en
vironments.
Now alone comes a club â named for
the riant of the California forest, the
Sequoia â wherein all the elements of
society are supposed to mingle. And
this cplendid idea took root in the brain
of a clever girl. Miss Bdnah Robinson,
whose hope has long been to see in San
Francisco such a club as flourishes In
New York (the Nineteenth Century)
end likewise in London.
The Sequoia has now grown to the
dignity of a householder, and on Fri
day night it demonstrated its splendid
vitality, when its members and guests
cathered in its new quarters at the St.
Francis and blessed them with the
benlzons of good fellowship. And 'twas
the good fellowship of the highest type
â that which springs from the intelli
gent friendships of clever men and
women.
From now on the members of the Se
quoia will indulge In the "drop in"
habit, and between 4 and 7 o'clock tea
will be served In the dubroom. Tea
for the men? Well, now. you know
what men want they usually getâ and
there's a push button In the clubrooms.
In the evening the members will find
much pleasure drifting in for a chat
and to listen to the music makers, who
play in the gallery just without the
greenroom door.
Among those who were identified with
the first evening at borne were: Charles
Sedgwick Aiken, president; William
Greer Harrison, chairman of the com
mittee; Courtenay W. Bennett, treas
urer; Miss Grace Llewellyn Jones, Miss
Jessica Peixotto, Ph. D.: Mrs. G. G.
NorrU, Mrs. Albert Gerberding and
others equally interesting.
Then along come the artist, the
sculptor, the writer and the maker of
music â all of that ilk for whom
money hath no charms, save for the
geod cheer it bringeth, who says: "So
ciety is an aggregation of congenial
people who contribute to the world's
work or to its pleasure."
And there you are â with a defi
nition of society reflecting the personal
view of each creature, colored wholly
from the circle in which he moves,
even as the chameleon changes its hue
according to its habitat.
But let us see what the first state
ment means â "the gilded fool" defini
tion.
Some there are who reply: "Society
is an aggregation of gilded fools."
Others less rampant will tell you that
tociety â the real thing â Is made up of
those born of "fine old families" and
reared in an atmosphere of ancestry.
Then there are the oracles who scoff
at the "old family" classification as
un-American and proclaim in favor of
the "self-made man â and the fellow
that's carved out his own career and
fortune."

Why, sculpture! And who do you

Ethyl Hager. And what's more, she's
under excellent instruction â although

creditable work. All who know Miss
Hager admit her cleverness and origin

the ability bequeathed her by her
father, the. late Judge Hager?

warrant from Police Judge Conlan's
court charging him with assault to
murder. The complaining witness is
Joseph Hoccour. a saloon-keeper at
148 Fifth street. Hoccour was sit
ting on a chair in his saloon one
evening about six weeks ago, when,
he says, Hawkins entered. Hawkins
had an iron bar in his hand and Hoc
cour says that without saying a word
Ha,wkins struck him on ti*e head with
the bar, knocking him unconscious.
Hawkins promptly fled, leaving the
iron bar behind.. His only explana
tion of the attack is that he and Hoc
cour quarreled. This Hoccour denies.
Hoccour Is still under treatment at
the French Hospital.
Hawkins some years ago was ar
rested for failure to provide and for
threatening to kill his wife because
she had left him owing to .his cruel
treatment. They were subsequently
divorced.

K. Yukawa, acting president; Dr.
A. Xis'hikata, director, and Kisatsuchi
Koda, director, of the Japanese Asso
ciation of America filed a protect with
the Board of Supervisors yesterday
against the plan of the Board of Edu
cation to establish a separate school
i for Japanese children. The communi
1 cation sets forth,' in part:
"Such unfortunate action on your
part would certainly go to cancel
i many of the former splendid and
magnanimous acts of this republic
In leading: Japan to her present
standard of civilization. Equally
unfortunate would it be for Japan,
because of the feeiins that she
must cast off that fraternal allegiance
y hieh her people have so long mani
fested toward the United States. But
we feel confident that it is not the
desire of the best element of people
of this country to cause ill feelings
between the two countries, especially
at present, when the sympathy of al
most the entire population of the
United States is with Japan in her
struggle in the Far East.
"That very strong feelings of
friendship toward the United States
prevail among the people of the whole
empire of Japan is greatly due to the
fact that Commodore Perry, who be
came an idolized hero by his distin
guished act of introducing our coun
try to the Western nations, was an
American Â«?itizen, and also to the fact
that a constanly increasing number of
our young men who have graduated
from colleges and schools in this
country are gaining distinction and in
fluence throughout the length and
breadth of our country. We feel
proud to state that many graduates ;
of American colleges or thos9 who
h&ve received education in this coun
try are holding important posts in
both Government and business life In
Japan. Haron Kaneko, who has held
many distinguished offices in the Gov
ernment and made a brilliant career,
was graduated from Harvard Uni
versity. Our present Minister, Mr.
Komura, and Vice Minister. Mr. Chin
da, of the Department of Foreign Af
fairs, are both graduates of American
colleges."
The protest declares that the Jap
anese children are the '.'equals of
American children in "every respect,
save their complexion." Appeal is made
to the Supervisors to make thorough
investigation "of this most delicate
and complicated question."

THE CALL is in receipt of a copy of the Year Book of British
Columbia for 1*503, compiled by R. E. Gosnell, Secretary of the
Bureau of Provincial Information. As a complete exposition of
the topography, the resources and civic conditions of our nearest
neighbor among the northern provinces this volume of near 400
pages bears strong witness to the enterprise of its promoters in the
provincial government.
To those of us here in California, unacquainted in great measure
with conditions in British Columbia, surprise must come with the
reading of such a compendium of facts relating thereunto as js set
forth in this Year Book. With the exception of^the districts adjacent
to Victoria and Vancouver we are wont to believe British Columbia
but a wilderness of mountains and snow lands with vast woods and
salmon streams marking its entire length. How erroneous is our
impression becomes manifest when we learn of great farms, cities
built'over the stumps of the forest's trees and whole districts spotted
with the smoke of smelters and ore crushers.
On the farms that lie within the zone of the railroads land
purchased from $10 to $50 per acre, according to situation, has been
made to yield increase in hay, stock and fruits to a total gross valu
ation of $3,479,682 for the hst census year. From. the gold placers
and the quartz workings $5,961,409 represents the output of the.
year 1902^â over three-fourths of the" total gold production of the
bominion,\exclusive of Yukon Territory. In coal $4,192,182 indi
cates the output for the same year; copper, $3,446,673. The sum
total of product from the fishing activities for the year 1902 aggre
gates $5,280,824. ,
Thus it may be seen that British Columbia, yet the frontier' of
the Dominion, has already made rapid advances in the develop
ment of its resources. Homes are rapidly being built in the interior
wilderness, manufactories are springing" up in the ports, railroad
facilities are being extended wherever new fields, offer. Yet the
Government officials assure us through their Year Book that "British
Columbia has only started in the fulfillment of her destiny.

A charming feather turban â a tor
pedo as to shapeâ Is in gray. It is
dainty and demure and will be charm-
Ing for the fair one who has an idea of
dressing in gray. Or it would be ef
fective if trimmed with a contrasting
color in harmony with whatever dress
was to be worn with it. A number of
colors are good wiÂ£h gray, especially
black and white, or emerald, green, or
the tritoma colors. A paradise in these
shades Is stunning on a fine gray.
One of the most graceful feather
hats is a good sized- turban; all in
olive. This lovely color, which blda
fair to be a full fledged revival, is of
a particularly lovely shade in ; this
case. In adidtion to being covered all
over with the olive-hued' plumage
there is at the left a tendency to
longer feathers until, at thÂ» very back
a little cascade of coque feathers falls,
over the hair. Tulle and velvet might
be draped around this; hat to advan
tage, and without doubt the tritonfa
colors would be superb on it. I
A clever new rolling brim sailor is
made entirely of dark blue feathers.
It is as simple as possible of construc
tion, though it looks elaborate. To
put it plainly, it is trimmed with a
shaded plume made of plaited, rib
bon. The plaitings, which overlap,
are made of plaited taffeta and the
plume, which- is composed of them,
starts at the left back, being caught
by a buckle of cut steel. At this pointy
the plaited plume is of a blue as dark
as the hat. With every row It grows
a shade lighter, until at the back
again it has grown almost white. In
this case It has shaded 'through the
cornflower shades and is particularly
crisp and feaching.â Philadelphia
Record.
One feather sailor is lovely, however.
It is of richly deep blue plumage, with
a roll around the crown of some plum
age in a brownish castor. This is as
rich as it is smart and it would require
no more than a knot of velvet to make
it ready for wear. Even this might be
dispensed with were its fair owner in
a hurry.
Nowadays one need not be content
with a single feather in the hat, since
entire chapeaux are made of feathers.
There are many novelties in these
feather hats. Heretofore they have
been in turban sizes. Now one may
have one of them in anything from a
tiny toque to a big brimmed sailor with
a modish roll. It must be admitted,
though, that it is prettiest in the me
dium sizes. Perhaps because we are ac
customed to seeing feathers of the
same s*ort on small, duck-built birds.
This is undoubtedly why the feather
turban seems more clever than the
large hat made solidly 'of feathers.
Hats of Feathers.
Xot without regret is the fashion of
going gloveless to be observed. The
thin end of this sartorial wedge was
inserted some time since at the the
aters and now the mode has been
pushed further and one finds women
who at one time would never have
ventured out of doors ungloved now
appearing in public places both night
and day with bare hand:?. It has been
urged that gloves and rings do not
agree. Better, it is argued, to show
well kept, manicured fingers spark
ling with gems than to encase them
in - gloves, which must necessarily
make them appear much larger, since
it is an open secret that gloves at least
one size larger must be worn by wom
en who wear" rings as compared with
those who do not. Again, it is plead
ed that in hot weather women suffer
much discomfort from gloves, whereas
man is freed from it. But all such
arguments are weak. The glove is
one of the daintiest adjuncts of a
woman's toilet. It possesses roman
tic associations, it is always charac
teristic of its wearer, it has an un
doubted air of refinement about it,
and, moreover, it is cleanly and hy
gienic. To say that without it a
woman does not look finished, that
she appears less dainty and less dig
nified, is perhaps a trifle exaggerated,
but at least it is a fact that inatten
tion to such trifles as gloves marks de
terioration in a woman. Anything
that has this effect is to be sternly
discouraged. And for this reason the
fashion of discarding gloves whenever
possible is not one which can be
viewed with equanimity. â Ladles'
Pictorial.
Gloveless Hands.
Former Princess de Chimay
to Be Seen in Vaudeville
While the picture of the assault and defense stirs the heart of
the world, it appalls the gentle millions who have dreamed of univer
sal peace. The nations of Eastern Asia offered to Europe a prey
too tempting to make that dream a reality. Whether they resisted
successfully or whether they fell, peace was put afar ofl[. â¢ The Mus
covite dream of wide and universal empire is the same pest to man
kind as when it was the wisdom that inspired Napoleon. Give to
Russia the sovereignty of China and possession of Japan by con
quest and centuries to come would see no peace, except in the same
slavery that Xapoleon forced upon continental Europe.
IT :s probable the final assault and the last desperate defense of
Port Arthur began within the past forty-eight hours. It is one
of the terrible military- tragedies of history. The failure, of Ku
ropatkin to raise the siege, his defeat at Liaoyang, his weary re
treat on Mukden and his final retirement fro\n that last Russian
stronghold in Southern Manchuria marked the beginning of the end
of the first campaign. Its incidents will close with the fall of Port
Arthur.
When the war begyi there were military and newspaper critics
in this country and Europe who declared that the vast preponder
ance? of Russia .over Japan would crush the island empire in the first
stages of the struggle. The Call then pointed out that the strength
of the two combatants was equalized by the remoteness of the field
of operations from Russia's base. The trans-Siberian railway was
built by Russia, primarily, as a military feature in her intended con
quest of Eastern Asia, the subjugation of China and the destruction
of Japanese nationality. The road served that purpose. It threw
into Manchuria the Russian force that joined the concerted powers
in the relief of the legations at Peking, and the ending of the Boxer
rebellion.
The rest of the world believed that these ends were all that
Russia sought by the presence of her armed forces in Manchuria.
This belief was justified by Russia's solemn agreement with the
concerted powers to evacuate Chinese territory at a common date.
Instead of keeping faith her military railway was ceaselessly used to
augment her force in China, and bring the material to fortify her
camps. She promised the United States to evacuate and keep her
promise as late as the 8th of October. But when that date came
no soldier moved out, but thousands came in to hold and battalion
the ground that she had occupied by craft.
The 8th of another October is approaching and will find Kuro
patkin fording the Soongaree and running to cover at Harbin, to
hold the railroad to Vladivostok. The military power of Japan will
have forced Russia to that evacuation of territory which she prom
ised the nations should be voluntary. The first conclusion of The
"Call proves to have been correct. Japan's command of the Yellow
Sea and her diplomacy in Korea gave her the military primacy im
plied in nearness to her base, and for the rest look into her skill and
courage on laud and sea.
She has destroyed an illusion which made the world a coward.
The vast population, army and resources of Russia have lain like
a shadow upon nearly half of the globe. Japan in one 1 campaign has
destroyed the substance which cast that shadow, and it has disap
peared. The sympathy of mankind goes out to the defenders of
Port Arthur. They relied on the fleet, but it has been beaten in
every sortie and its scattered ships have run to cover in neutral
ports. They relied on Kuropatkin, but the Japanese commander in
chief, Oyama, repeated the tactics of Caesar at the siege of Alesia.
by presenting a double front, at the same time maintaining the siege
and whipping the immense army that was marching to raise it.
Upon Kuropatkin has fallen the fate that overwhelmed Vercin
getorix. the leader of all Gaul.
The world has not been inattentive to the tactics of Japan, to
her observance of the rules of war and the desire of her commanders
to spare non-combatants and even the military forces of her enemy.
Her generals offered truce at Port Arthur and safe conduct from that
fortress to all non-combatants before turning the artillery upon it.
This was refused for Russia by Stoessel, upon whom is the responsi
bility for the carnage among the non-combatants. When the isola
tion of Port Arthur was complete, when the shells from Japan's land
batteries were falling on the decks of Russian warships in the
harbor, and they were forced to make their last sortie only to be
driven back or scattered by Togo, the fortress was summoned to
surrender, and Stoessel refused. This refusal can be pardoned on the
score of military honor, but not on the score of humanity. The sol
dier's trade is a hard vocation. Its rules of honor require that re
sistance shall project into exhaustion. And Stoessel, the free-born
Swiss, but servant of an iron autocracy, lives up to the bloody code
of his service. .
THE FINAL STRUGGLE.
As to his methods of treatment he
does not go much into details. When
asked how he casts out the devils he
replied:
"By prayer and fasting. I spend
nights and nights in prayer. Then
there suddenly comes to me a wonder
ful power, and I go for the demon right
off. It's either him or me then. Once or
twice it has been nearly me, but I won
in the end. praise the Lord!"
Each of his patients Is supplied with
a separate room, where, if need be. a
nurse looks after him while the pastor
is working ud the power that will en
able him to fight it out with his partic
ular demon. "Whenever it comes to
him. at whatever hour of the night, he
make3 a dash for the room that holda
the patient, and proceeds to exorcise.
One of his greatest victories over a
demon, he says, was achieved when he
was clad only in a nightshirt and a
pair of bedroom slippers.
"What damage is done to the demons
or where they go after the pastor has
finished with them Is an open question.
But they leave no traces of brimstone
or sulphur about the house. He adapts
his charge to the purses of his pa
tients. He once, cast out a poor
woman's demon for a trifling consider
ation that in American money would
be something under 73 cents. He pro
fesses to cure all sorts of utokness and
disease in the same miraculous fashion
and on the same terms.
He is not at all the type of man one
associates with the ascetics of old, who
were reputed to possess power_over evil
spirits. | He is a big man with a big
voice, reddish hair, sandy mustache, a
great double chin and 'a waist whose
tremendous girth constitutes an atro
cic-us libel on the claim he makes that
he finds in fasting one of the chief
sources of hl3 spiritual power. At his
home plush-bottom chairs, comfortable
couches and soft carpets take the place
of the stone floors, wooden benches and
slab of rock with which the old-fash
ioned demon exorcisers were, content.
FASTS AND PRAYS.
He began to tackle devils twenty
years ago, renting a small house at
Glossop for the purpose at something
under thirty-five cents a week. He
has prospered in his work; has built a
mission chapel at a cost of JS500. where
the faithful gather and bear testimony
to his victories over evil spirits, and is
now building a large house where, with
ample accommodation for his patients,
he will be able to carry on hi3 voca
tion as a demon specialist on a big
scale. For, strange as it may seem in
this materialistic age of millionaires
and motor cars, with many the faith
in demons abides as strongly as It did
in the old days of broomsticks and
witches and out of their patronage Pas
tor Howton makes a 'very comfortable
living.
He does not confine his attention to
literary devils or fallen angels. At;*-!
times he is open to an engagement to
cast out any sort of devil that has
taken up a human habitation. One of
the "entries in his case book tells of a
triumph over one of the old-fashioned,
hot and hissing fire and brimstone sort.
This is how he has recorded It:
"Pastor Greening of Leeds â Possess
ed, v/hen a lad, of most horrible demon.
Came to the home, where I fought with
demon, which eventually came hissing
from patient's mouth, like a fierce ser
pent. In casting this devil out the
room and everything in it shook and
the chairs danced about."
CASTS OUT ANY SORT.
The next entry records another con
quest over "the evil one of which ha
is almost equally proud. It reads:
"Case 2â Miss . Very highly con
nected. Brother a canon, uncle a gen
eral In the British army. Possessed by
a fallen angel, which I cast out. Lady
has since painted pastoral scenes,
which hang on my wall, and is now
my private secretary. Her own testi
mony is, 'I feel just like a bird let
locse.' "
"Case No. 1 â Lady novelist; possessed
by a very malicious demon. All her
stories were Inspired by nim. I wres
tled with and succeeded in casting out
demon. Lady fell in a dead faint, one
and a quarter .hours. Revived, and
completely recovered. Has never been
able to write stqries since, power hav
ing completely gone."
"When asked what was wrong with
her stories Mr. Howton admitted that
they were not so bad as many book3
that were foisted on the British pub
lic, but they showed unmistakable
signs of the cloven hoof and possessed
that subtle quality, in common with
all demon inspired works, of render-
Ing their readers easily accessible to
the same specie3 of devil and trans
forming them into writers of trashy
fiction, or worse.
At Glossop, a stony streeted, prosaic
little town In Derbyshire, he conducts
an Institution for the cure of the de
mon-possessed, where he makes a
specialty of treating those obsessed by
literary devils, and by exorcising the
noxious spirits, fits their victims to
become useful members of society as
clerks, blacksmiths, housemaids â or for
whatever occupation their natural tal
ents qualify them. He keeps a case
book In which he records somÂ« of his
most successful exorcisms and at tha
head of the list he proudly points to
this entry:
HIS SUCCESSES.
LONDON. Sept. 7.â Of the making of
books thert; la no end, but of the mak
ing of bad books there may be an end
if Pastor Howton's theory as to the
source of their authorship be accepted
ar.d his method of treating: the writers
be adopted. Mr. Howton, who once
held holy orders in the Church of Ens
land, but Ions ago set up a religious
establishment on his own account,
holds that bad books, from the erotic
novel in yellow covers to the maudlin,
romance in drab binding, are all alike
inspired by demons, and that he has
been invested with divine powers to
cast out the evil spirits and rid an
afflicted world of the products of their
malignant pens.

It Is doubly pleasant to chronicle
more frequent individual gifts to li

Effective efforts in behalf of library
extension are being made by the Li
brary Association of- California, of
which" Joy Lichensteln of the San Fran
cisco public library is president. The
object of this association Is to promote
the welfare"* of libraries? It is ambi
tious in its aims, for it intends to do
Its- utmost to change California as re
spects library advantages Into a second
Massachusetts.
There are in this State sixty incor
porated cities, 100 unincorporated
towns of importance and more than
1000 smaller places which have no
libraries of their own. It is evident at
a glance that missionaries of the sros
pel of good reading are certain of un
failing employment
The September meeting of the library
association was recently held at Santa
Cruz. It was an occasion when the
large-hearted hospitality of the citi
zens of Santa Cruz and the library of
ficials was given full play, the thirty
visitors being welcomed with srraceful
courtesies and earnest words of encour
agement In their labors. Papers were
read by several members at the meet
ings. Librarians Rlpley of Sacramento.
Graves of Alameda, Russ of Pasadena.
Miss Alice J. Haines of San Francisco
and Trustee Leask of Santa Cruz con-
tributed articles bearing upon the
special topic for discussion, "Essentials
and Non-Essentials in Library Work."
Miss Halnes* paper treated of classify
ing and cataloging a library. It was
stated that a catalogue Is essential in
a progressive library, that a well-class
ified library is more than half cata
logued, and referred to the combina
tions of the Dewey and Cutter systems
of classification, which are extensively
used. It was further urged that the cer
tain growth of a library should, be pro
vided for, and as printed catalogues are
not only expensive but are quickly out
of date, that the card catalogue proves
most satisfactory.
In an important presentation of the
"children's room" Miss Russ laid
stress upon the first essential, which la
âexcepting the first shelf of care
fully chosen books â a thoroughly
trained children's librarian. Her pro
fession should be chosen through
genuine love for children. Mr. Leask
dwelt among other things in his pa
per upon a library trustee's need of a
fair and open mind and a spirit of
co-operation.
The generosity of Californlans to
public libraries is morally certain to
be hereafter displayed on a larger
scale. In a collective manner this ap
preciation is being shown by various
cities through ampler appropriations.
EARTH ONE BIG LUNATIC ASYLUMâ IN 700 YEARS
bridge of libraries to which the people
could have access.
With fitting words the Massachusetts
commission closes Its admirable re
port: "The only treasure house open
to all is a library; the only wealth
which will not decay is knowledge. . It
is the birthright of every citizen of
this commonwealth to share these
treasures and "possess^ this wealth. The
virtue and happiness of the individual,
the felicity and refinement of the home,
the civic and material prosperity of the
people are all strengthened by the wise
administration of the public library."
What is being done to further library
extensions in California? , Much, when
compared with the inactivity of a few
years ago. .Little, considering the ur
gent wants. of the State. The twenty
nine buildings completed or in process
of erection by the Carnegie gifts al
ready dot the State from Redding to
San Diego. Not only in their respec
tive localities are they library homes,
but they 7 ' are becoming centers' of so
cial influence and intellectual power.

several score of traveling libraries have
been sent to hamlets, villages and
many towns not possessing a library.
These are awakening interest In good

One or two librarians have always been
members of this board, the others have
been men and women of scholarly
tastes and philanthropic disposition.
Thirty-six towns during the first year
and sixteen in the second year, after
the creation of the commission, have
availed themselves of the State's gift
of ?100 with which to" found their little
libraries. A smaller number of towns
In following years applied to the com
mission for this aid, but each year the
work has advanced with larger gener
al interests and benefits. It was re
served for the year 1903 to witness the
crowning of the labors of the commis
sion. In this fourteenth report it is
stated that at last every one of the
353 towns and cities of Massachusetts
has the right and privilege of a free
public library.
Another effect of the stimulating ef
forts of the commission is seen in the
wonderful liberality displayed by in
dividual givers in bestowing books,
library sites, library buildings and en
dowments upon various towns and
cities in Massachusetts. Many of the
buildings have been erected as me
morials of deceased friends. Not less
than 16,000,000 has been donated for
these purposes since 1890. Massa
chusetts now has 150 public library
buildings which have been constructed
through individual gifts, exclusive of
the thirteen donations from Andrew
Carnegie. /
The influence of this special work
of the Massachusetts commission ' for
public library extension which, though
begun as an effort to promote higher
standards of thought and action in
rural communities in their own State,
could not be confined to its limits and
has spread over the country till now
in a score of States sueh commissions
are established by law.
And it may be. noted as a gratify
ing feature of the times that when
ever a State adopts as its special care
any form of popular instruction for
the uplifting of the masses, public
confidence is immeasurably' strength
ened and the gifts of the wealthy free
ly flow to Its aid.
Illustrative of the value of the pub
lic library to the people may be quoted
the words of Senator George 1 F. Hoar.
In speaking of his early contem
poraries â Bryant, Longfellow, Whit
tier, Lowell, Holmes, Emerson, Sparks,
Bancroft, Prescott, Parkman, Motley,
Webster, Choate, Everett and Wendell
Phillips â he claimed that the magnifi
cent leadership of these men, who
were ' mainly from Eastern Massa
chusetts, resulted from the early
establishment at Boston and Cam-
NEVER before has Evidence
of the value of a State's
organized work for public
libraries been shown so
clearly as in the fourteenth
report of the Massachu
setts Free Library Commission. The
organization of this commission in 1S90 j
was the outgrowth of a deeply seated !
iÂ« eling of the best men and women of
. Massachusetts that something should
bfe attempted for the mental and social
velfare of the residents of the villages
and small towns of the State. There
was so little to interest and instruct
the young people living on the hillside
farms and in the villages that the flow
of young life to the cities became a
growing injury to both country and
â¢city.
After much discussion a commission
of five members was created by an act
of the Legislature. The members were
to serve without pay, were empowered
to furnish expert aid a~3 counsel to
â¢libraries applying for help and, most
important of all, were authorized to ex
pend for any town that would establish
a library one hundred dollars for books.
INCREASING INTEREST IN LIBRARY EXTENSION
Work of the State Commissions Is Proving Most. Effective.
The tendency of modern life is to
glorify the body, the first and lowest
of human elements. Our houses are
built and furnished with especial ref
erence to physical comfort and con
venience. The comparatively poor
now possess conveniences which the
rich could not compass in former
times. And there seems no end to the
possibilities of science for furnishing
luxuries which soon become necessi
ties. We spend enormous sums upon
our tables for viands with which to
gratify our appetite. Agriculture and
commerce make it now possible for
even the very poor to enjoy table lux
uries far above any positive necessity.
A gTeat part of the machinery of civ
ilization is moved by our desire to
adorn our bodies with fine raiment.
It is not a matter of health or .need,
frequently the opposite. There must
be beauty for the eye. Music for the
ear must be provided and every sense
must have its fill of gratification. Sev
eral hundred thousands of dollars
have been spent in our city within a"
month for the chief purpose of phys
ical gratification. We adore bodily
prowess and development. Far more
consideration is given thereto by the
popular mind and press than is be
stowed upon intellectual achievement
or spiritual conquest. Emphasis of
the body brings at Its lower extreme
the drunkard, the prize fighter, the
harlot, all just one degree removed
from the brute. If the other extreme
differs it is in choice of appetites in
dulged and these set in more esthetic
surroundings. No man is worthy of
the name who does not care for his
body, but he is less than a man who
finds his highest aim in bringing
forth physical possibilities. Such are,
nevertheless, common, both In quan
tity and in quality. The herd of hu
manity struggles for physical gratifi
cation. Such human beings are dia
monds, to be sure, but diamonds are
valueless if they are not to be polished I
so that their excellence may be re
vealed. â¢ â¢
He has taken a long stride toward
manhood who realizes that his body is
but the dwelling place of his nobler
nature. It is to be made the perfect
habitation of a perfect man. It is to
be duly kept in order and repair. Let
it be swept and adorned as fitting the
palace of royal character, but let It
always be subordinate to its tenant. If
intellect is that which distinguishes
man from brute, is not h^e who ne
glects his mind akin" to the brute?
Thought makes a man, yet few men
think. To these few men, "however,
the world . owes its progress. Explor-.
ers. who Jike Columbus, have, first
thought and then executed; scientists
like Edison, statesmen â¢ like - Hay. and
hosts of lesser men have' been the
civilizers of the earth. They are men
who have solved . problems. Oxcarts,
omibuses, team and .electric railways,;
automobiles and airships are progres- 1
sive stages in the solution of the prob
lem of transportation,' but not even
the oxcart came without in.tellect.3
Yet oxen and men dwelt together Jong
before some man made his -cart and
attached his oxen thereto.' r '-Men are
needed who can- bring "things ~to 'pass.
Comparatively few men do. Difficul
ties need to be overcome. San Fran-*
cisco would be uninhabitable. if some,
man, of intellect had .not solved, the
problem of water supply, and over-;
come the difficulties of topography.
Men who have developed this second
capacity of mind are not rare.^ Our
modern education gives excellent op
portunity for our youth to learn to
think. We need to guard carefully
against the tendency of youth to pre
fer avenues of manual rather than
those of mental exertion. Well trained
bodies are frequently met. Well
trained intellects are comparatively
few.

Having done this they die and are for

\poorer for their departure. Perhaps no
more can be expected from our modern
civilization, and yet wÂ« meet occasion
Â¦jally a man of different type who seems
. born for a purpose and who has set
his intent upon lifting the race. Bor
rowing the lantern of Diogenes let us
search for such a man. Head and
shoulders he rises above the throng.
Tae light of a divine glory is upon
his faoe. He moves beneficently among
his fellows, helping here and lifting
there till many a bent and deformed
character is straightened to behold the
possibilities of his own nature and rise
in the image of his Maker to better
things. In the occasional presence of
such men we are led to ask whether
it is not possible for every man to at
tain something of that nobler charac
ter -Kitnout which he cannot be truly
a man. Some men are grass, always
to be trodden upon; some are brush,
obstructing the passage of others and
serving no useful purpose; others still
are trees of moderate height with mod
erate power for good; while a few are
majestic in height and of extensive
power for refreshing shade.
They tell xis that man has three capa
cities for improvement â body, mind
and spirit. In this order they are of
cumulative importance, each being
more valuable than the preceding. He
only is a man who fulfills his highest
possibility in all three capacities.
And yet the man we want Is not sim
ply body and mind. The^body is leai
and the mind is flower, but the spirit is
fruit. The apex and crown of human
life is" spiritual deveFopment. ' The
image of God is in every man and our
highest privilege is to bring, it forth.
higher power than that of man. Who
will retrieve the political situation
from the morass where every man is
for himself and for what he can get
out of it. This" man's life in politics,
as elsewhere, will be for what he can
put into it.
Wanted, A Man who brings thlng3
to pass for good; who is endued and
endowed with a divine purpose to lift
men; who can be a brother to every
other man and see in every one a
neighbor. He will not simply count
one in the census, for he will count at
least a hundred in the community. He
will be worth a thousand when the
eternal time sheet is made out. He
has forgotten himself and has lived
for his fellow men. The poor and
the needy have been his friends. He
shall not leave the earth with the piti
ful accompaniment of costly flowers
and formal tears. But his shall be
the richer heritage of sincere love and
honor. Â¦
Where shall we find our Man?
Where, indeed, if not in the reader
himself? An obligation Is laid upon
us all to be such a man. It is a re
sponsibility not to be evaded. We
have no right to be faithless or even
mediocre. We owe it to ourself to be
the best man possible, and that word
possible has no boundaries. We owe
it to our fellow men who stand in de
plorable need of just such testimony
as we have suggested. Above all. we
owe it to God, who promises every
equipment for regal manhood and -to
whom we render final account. Let
every reader lift his face and heart^to
the Almighty pledge a loyal faith
fulness to his will.
Wanted. A Man. He may name his
own salary. The world will pay any

Whatsoever thou hast been, come now
and be A Man.
of settling these difficulties is wasting
time and breath. We need the man
whose horizon is wider than his own
door yard and extends to the eternal
hills whence cometh our help. So we
repeat our advertisement:
Wanted, in Society, A Man. One
who can be an inspiration to qur
youth. Who will present to them an
ambition not of gold or power, but of
royal manhood. A man who can
speak and live the truth. Who will be
like the sequoia to our boys in that
they, too, will have to stretch upward
to behold him. Who will be a protest
against the shallow artificiality of our
social life with Its tissue of falsity and
who will stand for absolute righteous
.ness in the midst of an unrighteous
age.
Wanted, in Business, A man. He
must be a human protest against dis
honesty. Not only is he not to de
fraud his associate, but there- are
cases in which he is not even to seek
his own. He is in business as God's
steward, and while his support is a
part of the contract, yet the profits
belong to God. It ia not necessary
that he get rich. It is not even neces
sary that he be able to live. But it
Is necessary, absolutely necessary, that
he be honest. Not merely legally hon
est, but intrinsically so. A good many
men are legally honest who will find
themselves behind God's prison bars.
This man. whether as employer or as
an employe, will stoop to no mean
method or low practice, but with a
sterling fidelity to his fellow man will
give evidence of .the divine spirit
wif'-in.

who could not " Â¦â¢ bribed with any

offer the Almighty a chance to reach

good, intellectual power is better, but
spiritual power Is supreme. Some men
black shoos, others run street cars,
.some edit Lvwspapers, others do phil
anthropic work. All are honorable, but
r he, Is most serviceable to humanity who
-strives to meet the greatest need. This
Â¦is neither of body nor of intellect, but
of spirit. No man does his whole duty
by his fellow who cannot give a spir
itual lift. I am not a friend if I r simply
feed the body and instruct the mind
and let a man's soul go into eternity
without a warning of his dire condition
apart from God. We honor Columbus,
It Is true, .but' how much greater man
was David Livingstone, who opened the
dark continent to beneficent truth. The
greatest intellect of the nineteenth cen
tury was W. E. Gladstone, who above
all other things stood for the impreg
nable rock of Holy ' Scripture. Mer
chants there are by the myriad, but. he
who, like John Wanamaker, stands for
human brotherhood and divine right
eousness is par excellence a man. It is
to the Incomparable credit of the na
tioivthat the men now most prominent

Increasing insanity be not stopped the
time will come wh'en the sane. will be
at the mercy of the demented.
"According to the statistics of 1903
Great Britain comes first on the list
of confined insane, the United States
second, France third and Germany
fourth, while many scientists claim
that almost the entire population oi
Norway is Insane, though not con
fined.
"The tendency Â©four 'higher educa
tion,' so called, and our 'improved
methods of living' is . to ; enrich and
eventually enfeeble the mind, which at
the same time impoverishes" the' body.
Deprive the brain of its proper susten
ance â rich, red blood â and insanity
sooner or later -follows. The race for
wealth, with Its accompanying cares,
anxieties and luxuries, not to say vices,
keeps the brain in a constant turmoil
and is a prolific breeder of madness."
Dr. Oscar A.' King sees great danger
from the. "cured" madmen who are dis
charged frorn institutions. .Said he:
"Hundreds of thousands of these peo
ple marry. The result? .The birth of
children predisposed to Insanity. The
children mature probably without
showing any signs of mental disorder,
marry into sound families never before
tainted with a drop of insanity and
spread, the contamination. With thou
sands of such marriages, and such chil
dren being constantly born' Into the
world, one can readily account for the
increase of .insanity... I think the royal
family of Austria, the Hapsburgs, are
about the best Illustration of this idea
that I know of. " "V
"It is safe to estimate, however."
DOES insanity follow in the
wake of civilization?
Are we fast becoming
a nation of lunatics?
Is Chicago going crazy
faster than any other city
in the world?
TaT these three questions three noted
Chicago alienists answer "Yes," says
thÂ«Â» New York World.
They are V. H. Podstata, superin
tendent of the Dunning Insane Asylum;
Dr. James P. Lynch and Dr. Oscar A.
King. They are corroborated by
Judge Orrin Carter, who presides over
the court in which the insane are
given trial. Dr. Podstata says that
on*- person in every 150 In Chicago is
insane and one in every five predis
posed to insanity. One of the most
popular Eor.gs of the year in Chicago
is called "Oh. Gee! Ain't It Great to
Be Crazy?"
Dr. James P. Lynch sees the eArth
one big lunatic asylum in 700 years
unless conditions change. "Insanity
has increased 300 per cent in fifty
years, and it has increased half that in
ten years," said he. "Drink, drugs,
speculation, worry, overwork, are
some of the causes of insanity^ The
conditions of women must change in
order to have a healthy race. Either
America will become a childless na
tion or the list of insane will swell
because of the nervous, weakling off
spring of the nerve-wrecked mothers.
"There are hundreds of causes for
insanity, and for every insane parent
one will find in the family of children
a predisposition to insanity. As these,
children marry, and remarry they carry
the strain of dementia with them.
The tendency of the times is toward
brain development at the expe'nse of
physical efficiency. Man's impetuous
haste for the almighty dollar, his per-
went on Dr. King, "that 70 per cent of
the present insanity is from predisposi
tion and that 30 per cent is due to in
heritance. There are more men Insane
in the United States than women, per
haps due to their harder mental work
and exposure. The use of alcohol by a
man may not drive him insane, but will
often give a predisposition toward in
sanity to his offspring."
"I believe that insanity to-day begins
in the schoolroom," said Judge Orrin
Carter. "Children are rushed through
their studies too fast, given studies that
used to' belong to the colleges, and
many of them graduated from the high
schools at the age of only 16 years. In
many cases this wrecks the nerves of
children, and many of them carry the
nervousness with them , through life.
But the . result is a nervous, fidgety
army of girls and boys, many of them
unfit for business life before they be-
upset the unstable in overwork; im
proper food and 111 ventilated quarters
are factors in the development of In
sanity. There is a considerable number
of women, the wives of laboring men,
forced In turn to labor and bear and
rear their children at once, who become
insane from pure exhaustion. In any
case of that kind the children are likely
to be weakened In their resistance."
Dr. F. Packer of the Bellevue Hos
pital, In New York, says that for
1902 and 1903 and six months of 1904
Bellevue Hospital admitted 2372, 2435

"There has been a big increase in ten
years. Much Insanity is caused by
stimulants used by man to push him
on, against the warning of nature. If
the overworked man would not keep up
on drugs nature would give him the
needed rest in the form of an Illness,
but under the whiplash of stimulants
when he does collapse, having no re
serve resistance, he often becomes de
ranged."
"The artificial lives we lead, violating
almost all of nature's laws, and the
stress of civilization are the causes of
insanity," said Dr. P_odstata. "Intem
perance is one of the chief causes
among our patientsâ about 40 per cent.
Next comes worry. Practical religion
undoubtedly strengthens the resistance
to Insanity. The highest alms', in life,
the lessened worry, the better habits of
life, are of great help in resisting.

In an expert eliminator. v
Eliminators are paid by the hour,
and of them quick, forceful decisions
are expected. Besides the direct re
muneration they receive there are com
missions to be made from selling the
articles eliminated. Often a piece of
furniture, excellent in itself, yet Inap
propriate to its surroundings, may be
rejected from one house by an elimin
ator who has in his mind's eye a place
in some other establishment where It
will fit to a nicety. He therefore does
the inexorable mistress of art a double
service in selling It for one patron and
buying it for another, turning for him
Â«aif in the meantime an honest b*o&*.
To those who have not as yet heard
of eliminators it may seem a bit amus
ing that this hypercritlcism of where
things should be and where they should
not be numbered among the furnishings
of up-to-date houses Is, indeed, being
seriously studied as a profession. For
merly mooted questions In such mat
ters have been referred to hlgh-c&ss
decorators. The new profession, how
ever. Is quite distinct, and while deco
rators often employ and send out elim
inators, it is usually done after their
own contract Is finished.
Eliminating would seem to be an
ideal profession for women â that is, If
their persuasive powers are great and
they contain abundant tact. The field
at present Is one of the \ few . not over
crowded. It is not one, however, to be
entered into Ilghtlyr or troubles multi

SIN'CK eliminating has come
flamboyantly into fashion
as a novel profession it may
perhaps be conceded that
there is something new un
der the sun. At least, from
time Immemorial it has been the cus
tom of American women to group
their, household goda and furnishings
exactly to suit themselves, and then to
let them stand, evidencing the degree
. of their respective tastes. In this day,
however, when the erection of palatial
residences takes place with something
of the lightning rapidity that char
acterizes an automobile chase, a vein
cf timidity has developed In even the
ttanchest of matrons regarding the
criticisms which In all probability her
new home will invoke. In the begln

Perfection apears to have gradually

main a few points about which she is
not quite sure. Perplexed by many
doubts, she calls in the eliminator.
This individual, whether man or
woman, is renowned for taste unques

ducement is allowed to shine forth
for the saving of art's reputation.

PHILADELPHIA. Sept. 24.â In one
of the most exclusive families of Phila

last week a tempest that is keeping a
private detective agency busy, has
aroused the curiosity of the police and
caused no end of speculation in society
tircles.
It is generally believed that a rob
bery was committed by some person
having free access to the house, from
which valuable plunder was taken, and
this seems to have support in the fact
that the greatest "secrecy has been
thrown about the whole affair. The
detectives are of the dpinion that a
member of the family made off with
the. jewels and that his relatives, while
endeavoring to bring about the return
of the stolen property, are trying to
prevent a scandal. -

jewelry valued at $4000. . z . ', >.

whether this evasion of the law cannot
be stopped. Â¦' ', y
Pepper's scheme is to find temporary
husbands for the women on this side
of the line. As the law provides that
an alien woman who marries an Amer
ican becomes thereby a citizen of this
country, the inspectors cannot prohibit
the entry of Mexican women who have
followed Pepper's directions and taken
this step. Immediately after their mar
riage the women are abandoned by
their husbands and turned over to Pep
per for disposal.
A few days ago three Mexican wom
en bound for Pepper's house in Doug
las were caught trying to sneak across
the line, and were sent back to their
homes In Agua Frieta, Pepper on be
ing advised of the action of the officers
easily found three Americans who for a
small fee agreed to become the tem
porary husbands of the girls. He se
cured -marriage licenses , from Tomb
stone and on Monday they again evad
ed the officers, slipped across the lipe
and were married to the three Ameri
cansâCharles Alexander, William Cum
mings and Herbert Rowland by name.
The inspectors reached the scene just
as Judge Royal O. Johnson of Douglas,
a Justice of -the Peace, was innocently
tying the knot. When arrested the
women set up their claim to citizenship,
and the committing -magistrate was
compelled to discharge them.
The women and their temporary hus
bands parted soon after. Pepper taking
them in charge, as had been agreed.

.'Thr. rÂ«rrÂ« of cancrr "by any treatment
Jcnown to medical science is such a won-
derful accomplishment that necessarily
the tchole civilized -world is stirred to
its foundation when a certain cure for
cancer is announced. As yet there Is no
certain cure for c-iucer. WÂ« mean by
th!s rtaÂ«crn<Tt that as yet there is no
treatment that will cure cancer of every
variety and those oasÂ«*s \rhlch permeate
all the crgar.s of the body. There is no
doubt, however, but that the Electro-
ChemJc tr<;atmpnt of cancer is the most
successful treatment yet discovered ana
that it wlil euro many far advanced
cases and all cafes In the early stages.
The cure of Dr. M. L. Banks of Colum-
bia. Mississippi, whose picture appears
at the top of this article, was a triumph
for the Electro-Chemic treatment whicn
cannot fall to impress all thinking peo-
ple. Dr. Banks had undergone two sur- ,
rfc&l operations for his cancer, which
had attacked the left , side of his face
and jaw. One operation was performed
in "New Orleans and the other in New
York City, hut after each operation there
waa a quick 'return of the cancerous
prowth. Dr. Banks was cured by the
Electro-Chemic treatment three years
a^o and there is no doubt in the world
but that his . cure Is a permanent one. '
The cure of Mrs. William Barnes of
Blacks. Cal.. of a cancer of the breast
Js another notable instance of the
â¢wonderful curative effects of the Elec-
tro-Chemic treatment in cancer. The
Electro-Chemic specialists are better
prepared to treat canet r than any other
institution doing the work, because of
their experience and because no ex-
pense has been spared in setting the
very best apparatus with which to do
the work. The majority of testimonials
that the physicians of the Electro-
Chemic Institute have published have
been of patients who have been cured
by Electro-Chemistry when all other sys-
tems of treatment had failed. In every
instance the testimonial has been Ken-
ulne a_nd exactly as stated. The Elec-
tro-Chemic treatment is curing cases
that have been pronounced Incurable con-
'sumption bv very well known physicians.
The Electro-Chemic specialists do not
claim that all of these cases have been ;
consumption, but they do claim that very ;
good family physicians have pronounced
them consumption, yet Electro-Chemis-
try has cured the sufferer quickly, per- i
manently and cheaply. In cancer, con- j
sumption, catarrh. Brighfs disease, dia-
.betCS and. in fact, in every serious dis-
ease, it is always advisable for the pa-
tient to seek treatment as early as pos- ,
sible. Any one having a sore or a lump
or a tender place, no matter upon what
pert of the body it may be located.
should give the trouble immediate at-
tention. Any one suffering from a
cough, general weakness, fever, night
sweats. pain between the shoulder
blades, pain in the small of the back,
should not direjrard these warnings of
nature and should give such symptoms
immediate attention. The Electro-
Chemic specialists invite all sufferers,
no matter what their trouble may be, to
come to them for a thorough Electro-
Chemic X-Ray examination, free of
charge. This is the most reliable ex-
amination that any sufferer can have and
by prompt attention many diseases that,
would eventually prove fatal can. be-
yond a doubt, be promptly checked and
thoroughly cured by the Electro-Chemic
treatment at a very small expense. The
diseases In which the Electro-Chemic
treatment is especially curative are can-
cer, consumption, catarrh, asthma, bron-
chitis, rheumatism, neuralgia, locomotor
ataxia, paralysis, falling sickness, epi-
lepsy, dizziness, headaches, spots before
the eves, piles, fissure, fistula, stricture.-
prostatitis, varicocele, nerve exhaus-
tions, weai heart, palpitation, shortness
of breath. Insomnia, blood poiuon. skin
diseases, eczema, goitre, swollen Joints.
'weak back, kidney diseases, bladder dis-
eases, Brighfs disease, diabetes, special
diseases of "6-omen â Irregularities, mis-
placements, ovarian pains, etc_ etc. Per-
sons living at a distance should come
for a personal examination when pos-
sible. Those who cannot come should
Â¦write a full description of their general
symptoms and full instructions will be
forwarded for home examination and
treatment. Separate and private apart-
ments have been set aside Jn the Insti-
tute for the accommodation of the male
and female patients. The Electro-
Chemic Institute is the only place on the
Pacific Coast where this wonderful new
treatment can be had. The success of
the Electro-Chcmic practice has caused
Imitators to spring up and physicians
with no experience and with poor equip-
ment are now trying to do this work.
These imitator* charge Just as much and
ofttimes very much more than the Elec-
tro-Chemle specialists, therefore every
one contemplating taking a course ot
Electro-CnemiBtry should be careful to
note the location of the Institute and
make no mistake. The Electro-Chemic
Institute is centrally located at 118
Orant avenue, coruer of Post street, and
the office hours are from 9 in the morn- :
icr until 5 In the afternoon and from 7
to I every day In the week, and on Sun- j
days from 10 in the -morning until 1 in ,
the afternoon. Consultation and exam-
ination are free to all.

completing the work of the first. It

were ready to receive the wounded,
the next train from the wreck arrived

the list up to forty r nint and there
are at: least six more at the scene of.

their regular meeting point. This ac
tion on thepart of the* engineer of thÂ»i
westbound, train is made more inex
plicable because of the fact that the
accident occurred in broad daylight
and, according to the best information
obtainable, he had the order in alit
tle frame in front -of him as his en
gine rushed by the- station and a milft
and. a half further on came full upon
an eastbound pasr.enger train. Th*
possibility is that the ill-fated engin
eer, may have been asleep. The trains
were on time and not making, more
than thirty-five miles an hour,' yet the
impact as they rounded a curve, and
came suddenly upon each other was
frightful. Both engines and the. ma
jority of "the cars were demol

ably never be known, as the t engineers
of the two trains were crushed, their

Story of General Attack Denied.
The misfortune he had courted pur
sried Von Horn and he returned to
Germany. He had expended his last
I'fer.nig when he went to his old colo
nel for advice. This stern soldier re
buffed him as contaminating and in
formed jhe police of hi3 presence.
He was arrested and his court mar
tial followed. But Bavarian nobles and
officers feel that the Baron's crushing
sentence cannot eradicate the blot he
wantonly put upon their reputation as
classes.
On the eve of discovery he fled to
LÂ«.ndon, where he vainjy sought to en
ter the British army. He wandered
about the English capital until he met
a former friend, who paid his passage
to German Southwest Africa. He tried
to Ret a commission to light against
Ihf Hereros, but failed. He opened a
tmall livery stable and seemed to feel
!;:s shame only when he was compelled
Ui do manual labor.
For a few years Von Horn appeared
to be a gentleman and a soldier, yet
secretly he was plunged in dissipa
tion. This became known to certain
blackmailers and the tribute Von Horn
paid for their eiience \ added to his
financial difficulties. Burdened by debt,
pursued by vampires, the Baron forged
tht- names of fellow officers to bills
amounting to $27,000.
MUNICH. Bavaria. Sept. 24.â The
Bavarian nobility, which numbers
some of the oldest families in Europe,
and the officers cf the Bavarian army,'
who certainly are as self-restrained
and efficient as any in the empire,
both regard themselves as disgraced by
Captain Baron Maximilian von Horn,
himself a scion of a proud and honor
able line.
Captain von Horn, an officer in a
crack cavalry regiment, only thirty
years old, married and with three chll
cren. who was a favorite at court, has
been sentenced by court martial to six
years' penal servitude, ten years* loss
of his rights as a noble and expulsion
from the army.
Women, wine, cards, horses drove
Von Horn to fraud, forgery and deser
tion from the army, and for the first
time brought humiliation so deep upon
his peers in rank and his comrades in
aims.

SAN JOSE, Spt. 24.â Plans for the
erection of the First Church of Christ,
Scientist, have just been completed.
The structure will' cost fully $25,000
and when finished will be the hand
somest in (he city and an architectural
ornament of the first rank. The site
is a prominent one, being near the
Santa Clara Club and facing St. James
Park. The style of architecture Is
pure Greek, after the temple of Ilys
sus, which Is regarded by archeologlsts
as a must perfect specimen of Greek
architecture.
The new edifice is to be built in the
form of a Greek cross with arms sixty
five feet long and sixty-five feet wide.
The walls will be surrounded by a
dome sixty-one feet high. The fronts
consist of an Ionic portico, supported
by four columns, between which the
congregation will pass into a spacious
lobby fourteen by sixteen feet in size.
A stylobate sixteen feet in height
will surround the entire church and
on this will rest twenty-two windows,
which are to be filled temporarily with
cathedral glass. Above these will be
fifty-eight pilasters and higher up
entablatures, upon which the dome
will rest. The xfalls are to bo of
plaster. The exterior is to be of
cement plaster. There will be an
organ gallery and reader's platform
in California woods, richly carved.
It is hoped that the congregation
will occupy the church soon after New
Year's. The design is by Wright &
Clark of this city.

She charges that they have supported
themselves on the ranch at the er
pense of the estate and fed themselves
with provisions bought by the estate.
They have borrowed money, it is said,
to make unnecessary improvements
and have paid commissions for the
collection of rents which they should
have collected themselves.
The bond market has been irregular
and somewhat less active. United
States fours and the old fours regular
have advanced U. the .threes % and the
old fours coupon % per cent on call
during the week.
Expected dividend increases, great
combinations and absorptions of rail
road systems and alleged contests for
control in the open market have been
made to feed speculative excite'ments
continuously and then relegated to the
obscurity of unwarranted rumors with
out material after-effect on the prices
which they had served to enhance.
The extent of the revival In the Iron
and steel trade is a matter of-constant
discussion and dispute in the Wall
street district. The effect of the week's
cut in steel billets, although long fore
seen, was bad, as was the opinion ex
pressed by trade authorities that pre
vious cuts in other forms had induced
but a moderate response from cus
tomers. The week's principal rumors
entered about Union Pacific, but they
proved bo numerous and contradictory
as to impair their influence and were
dropped out of consideration. The
withdrawal of funds from New York
by the Interior has continued, and for
mer estimates of the unlimited suf
ficiency of the banking surplus have
been revived, influenced by the rapid
rate of depletion of three previous
weeks. Interest rates are still on a
very moderate basis and the rapid de
cline in foreign exchange has indicated
that relief by gold imports might be
made in case of any urgent need. But
the- rising course of loans has had a
deterrent effect on speculation.
The incoming reports to the Con
troller of the September 6 condition
of national banks throughout the
country disclose a state of reserves in
the South and West that offers no
prospect of less than a normal call
upon New York for autumn require
ments. The reduced demand foi
money at the Stock Exchange,
prompted by the perception of those
conditions, is believed to be the cause
for the slightly easier tone of the
money market in the middle of the
week- ReDorts of railroad earnings
and of the course of general business
have been regarded as satisfactory, but
have lacked influence on stocks, owing
to their agreement with expectations,
which has induced previous operations
in stocks.
SPECULATIVE EXCITEMENTS.
in prices of stocks has not been more
than sufficient to meet the improve
ment in conditions which it set out to
anticipate. It is perceived that, part of
the expected improvement was not
realized and some unfavorable de
velopments have been taken into ac
count. As the period for the maturity
of the crops approaches, speculative
attention is concentrated on the out
come, the more so as the final stages
of their maturity are recognized as the
most critical. In reviewing the course
of the late rise in stocks it is easily
recognized that the crop prospects of
which it was Initiated have been ma
terially modified. Severe reductions in
estimates of all three of the leading
crops^ â wheat, corn and cotton â have
had to be made, and in the cases of
ccrn and cotton the process is still go
ing on. The estimates of the corn crop
generally accepted in Wall street this

days and even weeks, and then thrown
aside and forgotten without being
realized.

MISGIVINGS IN* EVIDENCE.
The general list was decidedly neg
lected and moved narrowly and not
more than was accounted for by
slight sympathy with the special
strong stocks. The bank statement of
fered no great surprises. A loan con
traction was not unexpected, but it
was not as large as was hoped for and
was not sufficient to prevent a further
fcubstantial depletion the surplus
reserve. Transfer of loans from banks
tu trust companies is known to have
been made to a large extent, which is

NEW YORK, Sept. 24.â Busy sur
mise, which has been seeking for an
explanation of the persistent strength
of Union Pacific, lighted to-day on an
alleged purchase by the Union Pacific
interests of several hundred thousand
shares of Atchison, thus insuring It an
influential voice la Atchison aftairs
and strengthening Its control of the
whole trans-continental railroad situ
ation. It must be said for this rumor
that there was better authority for the
credence attached to it than for some
of the many others and the sagging
tendency of the stock on the report did
not shake the faith of its believers.
The heaviness of Union Pacific was
attributed to profit-taking by the
speculators, who had followed the
movement, and the decline showed no
feigns of precipitation. The most de
cided effect was caused to Atchison,
which made a rather aggressive ad
vance, especially the preferred, which
was unusually active. The United
States Steel stocks developed great
strength without special news. The
details of the August exports showed
some very heavy declines in values for
iron and steel compared with July, but
the buyers of the steel claimed to have
encouraging advices of progress in the
revival in the trade.
Finally, after much wild talk and
gesticulating, the" Italians acceded to
the policeman summoning a doctor.
The physician came anc after working
over the girl for two hours got her out
of danger. The ambulance was com
pelled to return empty, the Italians
seeming to fear that the officials were
going to harm the young woman.
Taking the phosphorus from matches
is said be a common method .of sui
cide in Italy, but thjs case is one of
the first ever recorded in 'San Fran
cisco.
Pretty Mary Valanzerinio of 215 Val
lejo street made a desperate attempt to
commit suicide at her home last night
by swallowing a large glassful of
water Impregnated with phosphorus.
The young woman was jilted in love
and decided that death was sweeter
than an unrequited affection.
Mary, who' is employed in a Stockton
street millinery store, was engaged to
a young : Italian fisherman, who was
working In Alaska. A week ago he
returned' and found her in the com
pany of another Her explanations
were of no avail, and he told her to
go and have nothing inore to do with
him. The girl, who is but 18 years
of age, brooded over the loss of her
swain. Last night she went to the
corner grocery and purchased five
cents worth of block matches. She
took them to her room, cut all the
heads off, placed them in a glass of
water, and when the phosphorus had
dissolved, drank the fatal potion.
She was found by her father writh
ing on the floor of her little room. The
rest of the family were summoned and
the excitement they created alarmed
the neighborhood. When Policeman
Robert Silver attempted to enter the
room he was warned back by the fren
zied father, who threateningly bran
dished a huge club at the patrolman's
head. Silver saw that the girl was
near dead and finding it useless to
reason with the parent rang in for the
Harbor Hospital ambulance. When
that vehicle arrived at the house and
the doctor and steward carried in the
stretcher the crowd of Italians, by this
time attracted to the domicile, refused
to allow the young woman to be re
moved. The policeman and hospital
attaches tried in vain to explain that
their course was for the girl's good,
but the foreigners refused to under
stand. The father fell frantically on
the unconscious form of his daughter
and cried 'aloud that she would never
be taken from him.

SAX BERNARDINO, Sept. 24.â The
little daughter of a Mr. Greenleaf. a
resident of Ontario, this county, had
her finger blown off by the explosion
of a dynamite cap to-day. The child
had found the cap where it had been
lost by some workmen, and thinking it
a handy toy. amused herself with it for
a time until she knocked it against a
stone, causing the explosion, which
blew off one of her fingers on the right
hand. The noise of the explosion at
tracted her parents and a physician
was hastily summoned, but the child's
finger was so badly lacerated that it
had to be amputated.

tion* since the precipitation of .04 of ar
inch on the 22d instant. All of thÂ£
streams are running full, and while
there has been some damage from
cloudbursts in the desert and moun
tain Eection the rainfall in the agri
cultural districts has been Just righl
to help and encourage the farmers. .Th<
crop outlook is good and larger acre
ages of all crops will be planted for the
next season.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 24.â The precip
itation in Santa Cruz was more thar
four inches at 6 o'clock to-night, anc
at Boulder Creek 6.75 inches. The tabh
grape crop on the vines is almost s
complete loss, and the loss of win*
grapes Is very heavy. In the southerr
part of the county the bean crop, which
is about 2400 tons, is almost totally de
stroyed, as It was ungathered.
SANTA BARBARA, Sept. 24.â Santa
Barbara la being subjected to an un
precedented deluge. At 9 o'clock this
evening the precipitation was 6.3(
inches. Previous to the present storm
the September rainfall* has never beer
more than 3.17. this amount falling in
1898. The storm has done untold dam
age to the lima bean crop, and in the
city the violence of the storm has been
so great that trees have been uprooted
and other damage done.
SANTA ROSA, Sept. 24.â Rain fell
here in great quantities to-dayc The
streets were flooded almost from curt
to curb. Thunder and lightning camt
at intervals. Late this afternoon tht
rain came down in torrents.
BAKERSFIELD, Sept. 24.â Early
this morning .04 of an inch of rain fell
in Bakersfleld. About 5 o'clock the rain
commenced to fall again. No damage
has be8n done.
SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. 24.â There
COLUSA, Sept. 24. â It is raining
hard here to-night, with indications
that it will continue throughout the
night. Along the river banks are
marly 100.000 sacks of barley await
ing shipment. The rain is doing much
damage to this grain. Steamers with
extra barges are now working to get
the grain to shelter. There are about
1^00 tons of prunes 6pread out on
trays drying, but these have been
stacked. Thus far the damage to
prunes has not been heavy. Should
the storm continue much longer the
damage will be great.
VENTURA. Sept. C4. â Another
drenching rain visited tnis county to
day, making the precipitation at this
point three-quarters of an inch. In the
mountain sections the precipitation is
much heavier than in the valleys. The
bean growers are feeling pretty blue
over the outlook, though . if bright
weather follows much of their crop
will be Eaved. The small beans are
likely to suffer more than the limas,
because the pods are thinner. Beets
and walnuts are not injured. -The fate
of the lima bean crop depends on how
Jcng the soggy weather continues. The
crop is all right- as yet. '
REDDING, Sept. 24.â Four inches of
lain has fallen in Redding since Tues
day morning and to-nignt the indica
tions are excellent ror a continued
downpour. The crops are damaged
considerably. What few prunes there
wtre. about half a crop, were undergo
ing the drying process v. nen the storm
commenced and many were ruined.
Other fruit suffered to a very great de
gree.
The hay crop was bated and under
cover before the rain came.
The miners are jubilant over the rain
and want more.
NAPA, Sept. 24.â There was a severe
rainstorm, accompanied by thunder
and lightning, here to-night The rain
fall for the storm up to to-night is 3.40
inches.
WKT IN THE SOUTH.
prunes and some peaches In the drying
yards. If warm sunshine follows the
storm very little damage will be done
to prunes. If it continues wet and
cool the loss will be large. Wine
grapes are considerably damaged, but
the acreage is small and the total loss
in the vineyards will be small.

but whfn a uniformed pianist struck a
note which harmonized with the noise
of vibration in each part of the loco

thai there could be no flaws or cracks
in the engine. He was Informed that
if th<? noisÂ»? of the locomotive made a
discord with the musical note the loco
motive- would be thus proved defective.

Knplish financial papers are pur
lurbed over the prospect of loss to such
British holders of the bonds of the old
French Panama Canal Company, dat
ing US1-SS, as they do not hear that
they can participate in the 1S5.000.000
frgrus distribution if they lodge their
claims and proof with the official liqui
dator before December 14 next. The
proof must consist, of the original bond
or bond?, together with an official
statement of claim filed out in French
upon a blank which the liquidator sup
plies.
'J'his prescribed method might seem a
littlt exacting if it were not for the
fact that the old French Panama Canal
Company had a habit of getting out a
siew bond issue every few minutes, to
speak with slight exaggeration. Conse
quently there is a profusion of "obli
gations." which have been treated with
typical lightness since the company
went to pieces in 1SSS. It is figured al
together that the claims entitling hold
ers to share in the purchase money
aggregate about 1.S80.886.729 francs, so
that, if all bonds are presented, the
qualifying "obligations" are worth
something like 10 cents on adollar.
These bonds are entitled to qualify:
Obligations, 5 per cent of 1SS2; obliga
tions, 3 per cent, 15S3; obligations, 4
per cent, 18S4-5; obligations "nou
\elles." first, second and third series;
"premium" obligations, 18S8. All these
except the 3 per cents, third series and
premium bonds of 18SS will lapse un
less presented within the specified time.
The two issues in question were orig
inally put out through a separate So
ciete Civile, and their payment is in

CALIFORNIANS AT THE FAIR.
The county commissioners are careful
to keep well within the bounds of truth
when talking to visitors who are look
ing toward California and any stranger
who is induced by them to go to that
State will find things as represented.
Many who come to inquire are skepti
cal at first when told the wonderful
story of California's productiveness
and the ideal conditions that wait the
settler there, but they usually become
convinced that all is as told them. The
knowledge that large holdings in Cali
fornia are being opened up to small
farmers is becoming generally known
among Eastern tlllerB of the soil and
is helping the State a great deal In
its efforts to attract, settlers.
Thomas Hatch, who is in charge of
California's forestry display, is becom
ing quite a well known character at
Three of thjeir representatives visited
the California exhibit and were satis
fled from what they saw and were told
that California was a better field than
<Iowa. This Is one incident of what Is
being done. *
STICK TO THE TRUTH.
A WELL FILLED REGISTER.
Custodian Hatch boasts that 60,000
people have placed their names on his
register against 16,000 on those of a
nearby State; prominent for Its wood
product.
The eight delegates from California
the fair. Many, people visit the ex
hibit as much to see him and hear
some of his quaint talk as anything
else. Some of Hatch's practical knowl
edge, gained in the forests, upsets the
theories of learned professors who, as
he says, "come in to find amusement
arid go away thanking him for some
thing he has told them." Hatch is
not a theorist. The trees are' his com
panions. He has lived among them
and become acquainted with them by
association. There are a great many
things that Hatch doesn't know about
trees and the scientists do, but there
are some things he has discovered that
science can make use of and he has
been given many commissions by
learned men to make special observa
tions for them in his future life In the
forest.
to the Great Council of the Red Men
at St. Joseph, Mo., just ended, are vis
iting the fair. They are E. B. Wilson,
Sacramento; Josiah Sims, Nevada City;
John C. Ruddock, Ukiah, and T. H.
Sellers, J. J. Bryan. Porter I* Bliss.
J. H. Ilutoff and F. D. Brandon of San
Francisco. The party have been well
taken care of by Commissioner Filcher,
who is past grand sachem of Califor
nia.
District Attorney Bylngton of San
Francisco, who is now touring: the
Southern States, made a special study
of the methods of dealing with crim
inals In St. Louis during his ten days'
stay at the fair. He goes back thor
oughly impressed with the efficiency of
the San Francisco police force by com
parison, but says the St. Louis court
system has some features worth copy
ing.
A reception to Callfornians was given
at the San Francisco building Tuesday
evening last and was largely attended.
"Last week two agonizing appeals
came to me that I cannot turn a deaf
ear to, and I am now resolved to can
cel my dates and 1 by the help of Al
mighty God go to that awful city of
death and murder. I now ask all
women over the Stale and elsewhere
to meet me there on the 2Sth of Sep
tember, Wednesday, of next week.
Fring your hatchets with you! I will
pay the railroad fare of those not able
and see that you have a place re
served for your stay while there. Now
this appeal is made to the gentle, lov
ing Christian -women, whose hearts
are breaking with sympathy for the
Â©ppremÂ«ed, those whose dear ones are
being destroyed before their eys."

CHICAGO. Sept. 24.â Having de
clared that he would not live more
than a year after the death of his wife,
Mary, who was murdered for her
money in her home by Louis Pezant oh
September 18, 1903, John Spilka, on
the first anniversary of the murder,
committed suicide by strangling him

hac Just been found in a dwelling
where he lived lru seclusion. Spilka
last was seen on Sunday, the. anniver
sary of the murder, and from the con
dition of his body physicians agreed
that he must have ended his life on
that day.
Pezant, the murderer of Mrs. Spilka,
was hanged April IB of this year. Mrs.
Spilka was attacked by Pezant in the
hallway of her home and robbed of
$242, which was concealed In the folds
of her clothing. She was struck re
peatedly on the head with a heavy
stone and her body was carried to the
garret.

NEW YORK, Sept. 24.=â Antonio
Cucozza, the 16-year-old Italian, who
was arrested In conectlon with the re
cent mysterious kidnaping of Antonio
Mannino, the nine-year-old son of a
-wealthy Brooklyn contractor, ha3
pleaded guilty. He was charged with
having lured the child to Manhattan
as the agent of the kidnapers, who re
leased Mannino after several days and
have thus far eludÂ»d the police.
Cucozza disclaimed all knowledge of
the mysterious "Black HandV and the
Judge smiled when the boy gave it as
his opinion that there is no such or
ganization. He will be sentenced
later.
Antonio Cucozza Says That He Lured
From Home the Son of Wealthy
Brooklyn Contractor.
YOUNG ITALIAN PLEADS
GUILTY TO KIDNAPING
"With our knowledge of farming I am
convinced we can do better in Califor
nia than in Kansas. Alfalfa, dairy pro
ducts and livestock will make us
money from the start, and we can
gradually get Into the fruit business
if we see money in it. Ranches in the
thickly settled portion of our region
are probably at their top notch of price
now, and there is plenty of reasonable
priced land in California" if all the rep
resentations made here are correct.
When the money making part of it is
eliminatedâ that is, when a man can
make as much In one place as he can
in anotherâ he should choose for the
life residence place of himself and his
children that one ! which brings the
most pleasure and comfort and the
least hardship. When one can be among
fruits and flowers and perpetual spring
without loss of revenue he is not sensi
ble to stay where winter freezes and
the tornado destroys just for love of
association. I think the St. Louis fair
will result In a great many prosperous
families transporting themselves from
the Kansas and Arkansas region to the
inviting lands of California."
There Is not a county exhibiting at
the fair that has not attained tangible
results of magnitude. Captain Harris
of Kings County is now at Des Moines,
Iowa, .to arrange for the departure of
fifteen .. families, who are? to Â» iriove .. at
once to Kings County and . settle there.'
With the exposition a few hundred
miles farther away, there are many
farmers in Kansas and Arkansas who
would not think of visiting it,j3Ut when
it is placed at their very doors they
flock to it and gain a knowledge of
some of the wonders of the world, in
cluding California's climate and pro
ductiveness. The fair is proving a great
educator to the people of these regions,
and one of the most attractive things
to them seems- to be California's dis
play, the fruits shown there being in
bright contrast to the wheat and corn
grown on their prairies. They consider
a visit to the California section neces
sary.
"It's natural for people to become at
tached to the place where their homes
are," said a Kansas farmer to one of
the county commissioners, . "and we
â¢who have eone over to Kansas and
saved some money and got hold of
some land love the State, but I know
there's lots of us feel that we would
like to go to California and live. You
see, there isn't much variety of scenery
out our way and our climate isn't the
best, even not mentioning the cyclones,
so it is natural that those of us who
want to get the most comfort out of
life should have a. desire to go to Cali
fornia, where climate and scenery are
perfect, providing we can do as well
there as in Kansas. .^;-
OAN DO BETTER HERE.
In the crowds that visit this fair are
thousands of farmers from Kansas, Ar
kansa, Â¦ Oklahoma and contiguous
States. They are, nearly all prosperous
now, the day when the joke. about the
cyclone lifting everything off the Kan
sas ranch but its mortgage having
passed far into the distance. They have
been having good crops and getting
fair prices.^and nearer all of them have
a bank account and* a piece of land
clear of lien. Conditions are not the
pleasantest, however, in most of these
States, the, cyclone and the monotonous
prairie not being entirely conducive to
the happiest existence, and many of
them are looking longingly toward the
charms of the Pacific Coast region.
They show an Intense interest in Cali
fornia, and there is no doubt that this
fair, while not the most largely attend
ed of modern exhibitions, will be of
greater benefit to California than most
any other because of being within such
easy reach of these farmers, who would
be among the first to become residents
of that State and who have enough
money to buy homes there.
FAIR A GREAT EDUCATOR.

ING, - WORLD 1 S f FAIR, Sept. 24.â Big
events; at the World's Fair . like St.
Louis day bring Â»joy to the California
exhibitor, for they mean that his ex
hibit will lie. crowded and that means
still greater* attention drawn to Cali
fornia. The Golden State was certain
ly a center of attraction on St. Louis
day, the biggest of the fair's history,
and undoubtedly the one that will hold
the record for' the exposition. There
was almost a jam among the county
booths in the Agricultural building all
day long and at the California and San
Francisco buildings there were throngs
all the day. Between 15,000 and 20,000
people visited each of these structures,
the largest crowds they have yet
drawn. At the California building can
vas is always laid over the carpets an
big days,, but at the San Francisco
building it was found necessary to re
paint the front steps and re-oil the
rloor after St. Louis day, the immense
crowd having worn them almost naked.
There was a sort of reunion of Cali
fornlans at the State building and vol
unteer singing, instrumental music and
claret punch helped to make the vis
itors happy. Â»At the San Francisco
building Mr. Erwin delivered six of his
"picture talks" on California and each
one was listened to by a crowd that
filled the little hall to its capacity and
the passageway at its entrance. He
had mapped out a course of .five lec
tures for the day, but at the regular
one given in the evening there was
such a crowd that he immediately gave
another for the benefit of the overflow.
Had there been hall room perhaps 10,
000 people would have heard the lec
tures. The one given at the California
building also filled the hall to its capac
ity. There is a plan on foot now
among the county commissioners to
give a stereoptlcon lecture every hour
during the afternoons at the California
building.

THE ALASKA PETROLEUM AND COAL COMPANY has thirty veins of coal, running
from 35 -2 to 38 feet in thickness â ten of these veins over 16 feet thick, and of the finest, clean hard

No guesswork. No private paid expert.
We have on this property 100,000.000 tons of coal above the level of the creek.
Timber enough to timber the mines for 100 years. THIS COAL CAN BE^ LAID DOWN
OX THE WHARF IN SAX FRAXCISCO FOR $3 per ton. There" is no coal on this market
with which it can be compared. Men are now at work on the property developing it.
This same company has 11,600 acres of oil land in the same district. On the adjoining prop-

Coal oil 54.7 Benzine 21. 1
Yellow, or spindle oil 10.2 Cylinder oil 8.
Specific gravity 45B * No fuel oil here.
The world wants just such oil. It is right on tidewater ; good harbor ; plenty of timber and
mild climate. Two complete drilling outfits on the ground and men now drilling with prospects
of getting oil before November. The company also owns the townsite of Catella, the center of
this great oil and coal district. We have no salaried officials.
This property is located on Controller Bay, in Southern Alaska.
We know the people interested in as well as the value of the properties of this company, and
unhesitatingly say THEY ARE ALL RIGHT. Our business reputation would not allow us to
say this were we not thoroughly satisfied ourselves.

In it he implicates another man, but
refuses to give the name of his ac
complice or even give the slightest de
scription. It is the opinion of the po
lice that his story of an accomplice is
untrue.
Only a portion of the money has as
yet been recovered and Mitchell says
that his "accomplice" has the. rest of
the coin. The police, accustomed to
dealing with criminals of his class, be
lie-vo that he has the money safely
planted, that his .confession is inspired
by the hope of getting a light sentence
and that he expects to Vet the remain?

der of the money on his release from
prison.
The crime to which Mitchell con
fessed was one of the most daring in
the criminal history of the city. Early
Friday morning he held up the two
clerks, who had with them a dress suit
case containing $4400 in . cash and
checks, locked them in a room and es
caped with his plunder.
The robbery was at once reported to
the police and suspicion was cast on
Mitchell, who has been hanging around
the exchange for several months. . He
was arrested a few hours after the
robbery and subjected to ' the usual
course of "sweating." Yesterday aft
ernoon to Detective Wren he made a
full. confession. He sara that he had
been planning the deed for some time.
He had made a careful study of the
premises and of the customsMjf its em
ployes. On Friday morning. every thing
seemed favorable and he carried out
his, plans.
The robber yesterday. took Detective
Ed Wren to his home at 1537 Octavia
street, where a part' of v the money and
all of the stolen checks, bonds, securi
ties and papers were recovered. Mitch
ell had $620 in gold inV a sack' hidden*
in the attic and $70 In silver, with all
the papers, stowed ; away in the base
ment of the flat. The: checks repre
sented in value $939. This leaves a bal
ance, of more than $2000 not . recovered.
The : 6ult case . has not yet been found.
The thief alleges that his pal got away
with the balance of the money, ;, but

The walnut crop of France will be
normal, and if September should be wet
nuts will ripen badly and not dry well
after being harvested. As there are no
nuts yet in the market prices are spec

Consul Tourges reports from Bor
deaux on August 25 regarding the prune
crop of 'France that all- fruits are
abundant and* of superior quality this
season, and an early and large vintage
is promised. The prune crop is esti
mated to be at 55.115,000 pounds. This
is above the usual quantity. Fruit not
large, averaging seventy to the pound,
quality excellent, the dry weather .of
the past six weeks having developed
the sugar in the prunes to an unusual
degree. No prunes of this year's crop
in. the market yet, and prices are not
certain.
Consul Byrne at Valencia writes on
August 26 about the Valencia and De

CONSULS REPORT i ABOUT
EUROPEAN -FRUIT CROPS
The crop of walnuts for 1904 in Hun
gary, Austria and Bosnia-Herzegovina
will be a little better than a middle
crop. The nuts will be small and dry
meated on account of the drought. Low
prices will prevail, say about 12 to IS
crowns (52 43 to 53 65) per fifty kilos
(110 pounds) ab station. An average ad
dition to the net price of 1^ crowns
(30 cents) must be made for getting the
walnuts to Budapest. Freight varies
from Budapest to New York, according
to the rates fixed by the . steamship
lines. A Budapest firm quotes walnuts
fruit will be the result. The crop of the
previous year! is entirely used up. The
net prices 'ab station* for 1904 prunes
have risen, therefore 2 crowns (41
cents) per .100 kilos (220 pounds), and
prices quoted c. i. f. New York are as
follows: 110-120. 95-100, S0-S5, equal quan
tities of like brand 26'^ shillings (J6 44)
per 100 kilos (220 pounds) via steamer
from Flume. .
"The constitution provides that the
financial secretary of the union ; shall
receive all moneys j of the union and
subsequently, pay over the same to the
treasurer. The treasurer is required
to give a bond for the security of the
funds received by him and deposit
them in bank. It is clear that Andrews
and Burkhardt of the Mclvor faction
were respectively elected to the offices
ot financial secretary j and treasurer.
The circumstance that, in view of. the
turbulence of the meetings in question,
they were not installed does not, in my
opinion, affect the legality of such elec
tion. As treasurer and financial sec
retary, under the constitution, they
have the rizht to the custody of the
funds of the union, consequently the
cc/urt is powerless to make any order
requiring them to turn over the funds
to the plaintiffs herein. ,*,â.*
"In view of th's conclusion and of
the fact that the plaintiff, Sheehan, had
no legal status to commence these pro
ceedings, the question which faction has
the right to- use the designation 'Local
Union No. 19' does not arise and is not
decided. In consequence of these views
it follows that the bills In both actions
should be dismissed and, the injunction
dissolved and it is so ordered."
"The plaintiff, at the time bt his
election, either held a political posi
tion or no position at all. I "think
that under the provisions of the char
ter he held a political position and
hence was ineligible for the office of
president of the union; consequently
he had no status in this case because
the action in question was 'instituted
by him as such president.
"But, while the election of Sheehan,
on December 28. to the office of presi
dent was illegal, I think it is clear that
the other parties elected on that even
ing and - on January 11 were properly
elected officers of the union. -
"The position thus ; occupied by
Sheehan at the time of his election
was, in my opinion, a 'poliMcal posi
tion' within the meaning of the con
stitution of the union. . His employ
ment was a public employment; his
work was done for the public; he was
paid u regular and fixed salary per
month out of the public fund and he
could have been required by the board,
If it' so desired,' to execute abond for
the faithful performance of his duties.
"The authors of the constitution in
question clearly understood the dis
tinction between a mere employment
and . official incumbency. Section" 7
of article XXVI declares that a member
appointed to a political position shall
not be eligible to hold office in the
brotherhood, local or general. The
purpose of this constitutional provi
sion was evidently to. exclude from of
ficial position within in the union any
one occupying a position of public em
ployment. Its design was, no doubt,
as one witness testified, to keep poli
tics out of the union.
A POLITICAL POSITION".
"Sheehan. the plaintiff! testifies that,
as a painter, he was then employed by
th* Board of. Public Works of this city
and county, and as such working upou
the public buildings; that he was ap
pointed upon a certification of the
Civil Service Commission, and was re
ceiving a- regular salary, which was
paid from the treasury of the city and
county upon a salary demand properly
audited.
"In my view the case pivots upon
the point of the eligibility of Sheehan
to hold the office to which he claims
to have been elected. If, under the
constitution of the union, he was elig
ible to such position, then, notwith
standing the irregular manner in
which the election was conducted, I
think he was legally elected. But if he
was Ineligible, then Jenkins, the then
president of the union, continued to
held office until his successor was duly
elected and installed.
"At the next regular weekly meet
ing, of January 11, the vice president
presided, Sheehan ; having in vain en
deavored to call the meeting to order.
In the noise and tumult which ensued
the -conduct of business became al
most Impossible. It, however, pro
ceeded sufficiei My far to elect as
treasurer one Berkhardt; thereupon
the meeting adjourned to January 18.
On that evening the former president,
one Jenkins, appeared upon the plat
form-and stated that, to avoid the dis
order which had previously occurred,
he would submit to the house the
question whether he or Sheehan
should preside.
"In view of the conflicting and ir
reconcilable state of the testimony it
is difficult to state in detail what fol
lowed, but it substantially appears
that just as the house was dividing to
vote upon the question Sheehan 'ad
journed* the meeting and directed his
followers to assemble at the rooms of
the Building Trades Council on Mis
sion street. Thereupon he left the
hall, accompanied by a number of
men, variously estimated at from 150
to 250. These men constituted the so-'
called 'Sheehan faction 1 ; after their
departure there remained a number
of men variously estimated at from
150 to 300, who constituted the so
called 'Mclvor faction.' After Shee
han and his followers had withdrawn
they held a meeting, Sheehan being
in the chair, and elected certain of
ficers, including a financial secretary
and treasurer.
ity was again presented and a -motion
was made to go into the election
anew. That motion was declared out
of order by the chair and on appeal
the. decision of the chair was sus
tained. On motion the election of the
remaining officers was postponed un
til the following week; thereupon, it
is claimed, Sheehan, Berrinque and
Bowen were installed in office, An
drews refusing to be installed. In re
spect to this matter, however, the tes
timony is very conflicting, and In the
view I have adopted it becomes un
necessary to determine what the fact
In that regard was. ! f . : /: ;
SHEEIIAX BOLTED.
'â¢The complaint in the other action
declared that on January 18, 1901, a
number of parties previously belonging
to the union seceded therefrom and at
tempted to organize a new brother
hood bearing the designation of 'Local
Union No. 19'; that the use of said
name was unauthorized and occasioned
damage and injury to the plaintiffs,
who allege that they and the members
for whom they sue are the legitimate
andjauful members of 'Local Union
No. IS.' The complaint prays for an
injunction restraining the use of that
name by the defendants and to recover
the sum of 510,000 damages, alleged to
have been sustained in the premises.
"Both actions were tried together.
It appears that on the evening of De
cember 2S, 1S03, a regular semi-an
nua". ejection of the r>ftic. j rs ~>f lli^
union should have taken plat:?, "lie
constitution "of the union provided
that any member 'nominated, elected
or appointed to a political position'
should not be eligible to hold office in
the brotherhood. When the name of
Sheehan was proposed for president
his eligibility was immediately attack
ed upon the ground that he held a
political position. The point of order
thus made was overruled by the chair,
an appeal was taken and the chair
was sustained; thereupon the meeting,
amid tumultuous disorder, elected a
vice president, recording secretary and
financial secretary and adjourned.
' The next weekly meeting thereaf
ter, on January 4, was presided over
by Vice President Bowen, Sheehan
apparently making no effort .to pre
side over the meeting. At that meet
ing the question of Sheehan's eligibil-
"The complaint in one of the actions
alleges that on the evening of Decem
ber 28, 1903, Sheehan was elected presi
dent of Local Union No. 19; George P.
Bo wen. vice president; one Berrinque,
recording secretary, and H.' L. An
drews, financial secretary. That at a
meeting of the union subsequently held,
<:n January 11, one Burkhardt was
elected treasurer. That some of the of
ficers thus elected subsequently refused
to be installed and refused to turn over
to their successors, who were duly
elected officers, the property of the un
ion, which consisted, among other
things, of moneys in bank, certain
shares of stock in a planing mill and in
the Labor Temple and in a newspaper
called Organized Labor. The action
was brought to compel an accounting
from the recalcitrant officers.
SPLIT IN* UXIOX.
The bitter factional fight in the Paint
ers*. Decorators' and Papernangers'
Union, which was carried into the
courts and occupied weeks of trial in
Judge John Hunt's court, has been de
cided against the so-called "Sheehan
faction," and the temporary Injunction
heretofore granted Is dissolved. Shee
han claimed to have been elected presi
dent of the union, but Judge Hunt
holds that he was ineligible for the of
fice because he held a political position
âpainter for the Board of Public
Worksâ contrary to the rules of the
union. The other officers elected by the
Sheehan following are held to be legally
in office. They do not include the treas
urer and financial secretary, who were
elected by the Mcjvor faction.
Two actions *:ro. filed by Sheehan,
and in his long opinion Judge Hunt re
views the facts in both cases. The
opinion follows:

Not Eligible for Office in Labor Organization

the dark doings on the Congo and deals
with the enrly history of the -Congo

upon native life and upon International

"Our memorial is a respectful appeal
to the American public through their
Chief Magistrate. We appealâ that is
all â and we give our reasons for the
step. We found our appeal upon . the
historical basis that Stanley, an Amer
ican citizen, opened up these vast lands
to what was thought at the time to be
a Dower of sound statesmanship, in
spired by liberty-loving instincts and
humanitarian feeling. We "found It
upon the historical basis that the Gov
ernment of the United States was the
first to recognize the flag of the Inter
national Association which subse
quently became the Congo State, and
that that recognition had a profound
influence in shaping the subsequent
course of events. You extended that
recognition on certain well denned lines,
on the strength of certain specific and
solemn promises. You were told, as
we in~Europe were told, that King Leo
pold's policy was practical, liberal and
humanitarian; that the natives would
receive just and equitable treatment
and that the Congo Basin would be
flung open to the legitimate enterprise
of all nations. We urge respectfully
that If the terms upon which American
recognition was secured have not been
keptâ and I Â¦ do not think that there
can be much doubt on that^score â that
the right and the obligation of the
United States Is to Insist on their ob
servance and, although you did not
actually ratify the Berlin actâ which
your representatives helped materially
to draw up and, also signed â you took
a prominent part in the framing c-f the
Brussels act, which was the sequel and
the corroboration of the conference of
Berlin. ' .

APPEAL TO AMERICANS.
I aEked Morel if his visit could be
considered* in the light of a semi-offi
cial step. He replied:
"Not in the least. I go in the Inter

public which is interesting itself in this
question, as the representative "of. an
independent association belonging to
no particular party in the state, but
Including men of the most varied polit

and, for that matter, nationalities. I
may remind you, by the way, that
among the supporters of the Congo Re

Henry Phipps and Bishop Hartzell,

Deuss of Hamburg, and others.
"I am going to America," he said,
"partly by invitation to address the

Circulation increased 5611,900 and the
Â¦Jarge8t gain' In this Item was by one
bank. Comparisons of loans show that
eight banks reduced this item by two
and three-quarter millions net; these
banks lost three-fifteenths of a million
net in cash. Compared with August 27;
five of the larger banks show a net
expansion of twenty-seven and a half
millions In Joans, a net reduction of
twenty-eight millions in cash (or nearly
the whole of the loss indicated by all
the banks in the association) and a
net gain of one million in deposits.
. NEW YORK. Sept. 2fâ The Finan
cier says: One notable feature of the
official statement of the New York 'As
sociated Banks last week was' the de
crease for the.first time since the week
endins.August.27 of loans and deposits,
the former; by {2.454,000 and the latter
by 510,103,500, making the net- increase
In loans since the above date of 539,
447,600 and on deposits cf 566,750,300.
The cash reserve showed a loss last
week of 55,633^000, which sum very near
ly corresponds with the loss as esti
mated upon the basis of the traceable
movement* of money during the week,
there beinsr a difference of only 5465,
600. The required reserve was reduced
through the decrease In deposits by
52,530,875,: which sum, deducted from
the loss in cash, left $3,102,125 as the
reduction Jn surplus â¢ reserve to 526,
251,075. Computed upon the basis of
deposits, less those of 523,437,100 public
funds, the surplus is 532,110,350. j
The decrease of 52,454,000 In loans, as
above stated, was probably due to the
liquidation of speculative accounts in
the 'stock market during the week, the
result cf the unfavorable reports as to
the yield ofcorn. The Btatement failed
to balance, the sum of the reduction In
loans and of the loss in cash being 52,

posits. ' .. ... Â»

Uricsol cures rheumatism In the only
possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
of Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of (he body.
These deposits must be dissolved and
eliminated from the system before a
cure, can be accomplished.
Uricsol Is a solvent of these and tones
up the system, stimulates the kidneys,'
liver and bowels and thus drives them
from the system.. ", ( -
Uricsol is harmless and no. injurious
results can possibly come to any, part
of your body.

CirirWar Statistics Show 3Iore Fight
ing and Greater Slaughter Thau
In Present War.
Within a day or two pa3t a statement
was issued from Tokio to the effect that
the total losses in killed suffered by tha
Japanese army since March 23, when
the crossing of the Talu River was
made, to the present time, were in
round numbers about 12,000 men.
Doubtless the number of wounded was
three times as great, which would
make the total losses in battle in the
four months of campaigning about 48.
000 men. or, say, 50.000.
The Japanese are reported to bar*
fought with extraordinary courage and
even disregard for life, while the Rus
sians are known to be stubborn and
sturdy fighters. Both armies have im
proved long-range small arms and
breech-loading cannon, besides ma
chine guns of the most formidable de
scription. The Japanese nave had la
the field not less than 250,000 men.
while the Russians had 150,000. Tha
Russian losses are not known, bat as
they generally fought behind defenses
of some sort, it is likely that their
losses were not so great as those of thm
Japanese.
If this Russo-Japanese campaign far
the months of April, May, June and
July, 1S04, Is to be taken as a type of
warfare under the conditions of modern
improved armsâ one side attacking and
the other defending, says the New Or
leans Picayune â it win not be out of
place to make some comparisons vrith
the campaign in Virginia In 13S4 be
tween Lee and Grant, commencing at
the Wilderness on May S anri ending- at
James River June 12.
The *"On-to-Richmond"" movement
that had been attempted by the Fed
eral armies under Generals McDowell.
McClellan, Pope. Burnside and Hook
er with such conspicuous failure and
disaster, was undertaken by General
Grant in the spring of 1S64, and his
first encounter with Lee was in ihe
beginning of May. He had at ths
battle of the Wilderness May 5, which
was the opening of the campaign.
113,000 men of all anna; Lee had 61.
000.
The battles of the Wilderness, Spoti
sylvanla. North Ana. Cold Harbor and
Bethesda Church. besides almost
daily skirmishing, were fought, in
flicting a loss on the Federal forces
of 7620 killed and SS.242 wounded,
making a total of 45.9(2. . If to thesa
are added the prisoners taken ty Lee.
the Federal loss foots up 54.329. or
very nearly one for every man General
Lee had for duty. The Conrederaf*
loss in the entire campaign is not ob
tainable with accuracy, but it so re
duced General Lee's army thit ita
strength was about equal at the end
of the campaign to Grant's killad anJ
wounded. The battles were fought
with muzzle-loading guns, and yet. in
proportion to the strength of the
armies, the bloodshed -was vastly
greater than that in the Russo-Japan
ese campaign, of double the duration,
with armies of more than double the
strength of those of 1864.
The Confederate war of 1861-65
continues to be an important basis of
comparison by which to appraise what
is called modern warfare -with most
improved weapons.
The Odor of Ambergris.
The druggist held in his hand a ltxmp
of gray substance like putty. It was
smaller than a baseball and as light as
cork, says the Seattle Post-Intelli
genccr. Through it. here and there,
ran streaks of yellow and black.
"This Is a lump of ambergris," thÂ»
druggist said. "It is worth about SSOQ.
I judge. Smell it."
, The patron put his nose to the amber*
gris. Then he said, surprised:
"Why, it has no smelL"
The druggist, smiling, rubbed it witH
his sleeve, and immediately a powerful,
musklike cdor filled the air.
"Crude ambergris," he said, "never
smells until you warm it up or rub it.
This chunk of ambergris here smells
like musk. That is because it is crude.
The odor of prepared ambergris has
not the least semblance of uÂ»usk."
He rubbed his hand over his sleeve.
"From handling this." he said, "my
coat will smell till the autumn. My
hands, no matter how I wash them,
will smell for several days."
After a legal battle that lasted tvro
days Mrs. Alice Woods left the court
room this afternoon with her seven
year-old daughter in her arms. Judge
Ellsworth having awarded her the cus
tody of the child. The girl had been
taken by her father, Jacob B. Woods,
with her little brother to OUnda in
Shasta County, -where he iraa living
with the children in a cabin. In order
to obtain possession of the little girl
Mrs. Woods had recourse to the courts.
The father obtained a divorce from
the mother on the ground of desertion
and was awarded the custody of the
children, he agreeing to let them stay
with his sister, a Mrs. Tyrrell, where
Mrs. Woods could see them as often as
she wished. Without giving her any
warning, however, he moved away and
took the children with him.
On the witness Etand Mrs. "Woods
said that she had not objected to the
father having the custody of the chil
dren, as she had no way in which to
provide for them and had been advised
by her attorney that the court could
always change the order. Since then
she has established herself in a hair
dressing business and says she is able
to provide a proper home for the little
girL
An attempt was made to show that
the mother had callers at her rooms
late at night and that she was not a fit
and proper person to hare the custody
of the child, but Judge Ellsworth did
not take much stock in the evidence
offered -and gave the child to the
mother.

A terrific explosion of acetylm* gas,
which had escaped from a faulty tank,
this evening at 10 o'clock inflicted seri
ous if not fatal injuries upon one man,
painfully injured two others and
wrecked the Chicago Hotel at Third
and Bristol streets in West Berkeley.
That others were not injured is due to
the fact that the greater part of the
force of the explosion was exerted to
ward a large barroom, which was for
tunately unoccupied at the time.
The Injured men are: J. H. Sweet
man, proprietor of the hotel, face bad
ly cut by flying glass and plaster; S.
D. Parker, cabinet maker, face cut by
flying glass and possibly internal in
juries, and Edmund Motrac, shoemak
er, face and hands cut, and . badly
bruised about the head and shoulders.
The barroom and several sleeping
rooms of the hotel were entirely
wrecked by the explosion, which was
felt a block away.
The eas tank was in a room at the
rear of the hotel bar, and about 10
o'clock Sweetraan, the proprietor, no
ticed the smell of escaping gas. Ac
companied by Parker, who was the
only other occupant of the saloon, he
went to investigate.
As the two men entered the room
Parker stepped in f ront of the pro
prietor. A lamp was burning in the
room, but was turned aown very low,
and in order to see what tha trouble
was, Parker struck a match. In an
instant the explosion followed, for the
opening of the door had caused a draft
which drew thÂ» escaping gas directly
toward the two men. The force of the
explosion hurled Parker to the floor,
where he was covered with fallen plas
ter and debrist Sweetman, being be
hind Parker, was to some extent pro
tected and was not so seriously injured
as his companion. He dragged Par
ker, who was unconscious, out of the
building and although he himself was
cut in a dozen places by the flying de
bris hurried for assistance. Parker
was carried to a near by house and a
doctor was called. The full extent of
his injuries Is not yet known.
Metrac was sleeping in a room di
rectly above the room where the ex
plosion took place. He had been
awakened by the odor of the escaping
gas and had just opened his window
to see where the smell came from
when the explosion occurred. Metrac
was thrown clear across the room and
was badly cut by glass from the
broken window. Had he been in bed
when the explosion took place he
would have been killed, for his couch,
was entirely demolished.
An alarm of fire was sent in and a
few moments after the fire companies
were on the scene, but there was no
need of their service. . .

In obedience to habit, William J. Mc-
Coy tried the door of the Contra Costa
Company's office on his way home
from the 1 o'clock train this morning
and unexpectedly scared up a safe
cracker. McCoy is a clerk .in the of
fice and he has tried that door perhaps
a thousand times, but last night was
the first time that he had ever "flush
ed" a burglar. It was all so thrilling
that the burglar escaped before McCoy
got his breath back, but he has the
satisfaction of knowing, any way, that
he prevented the safe from being
robbed â even if there wasn't any
money in it.
It is the habit of McCoy, as well as
the other employes of the office, to try
the latch on the door whenever passing
at night. It was habit that prompted
McCoy to try it last night. But the
moment he made the first rattle a man
rose in front of the safe and stood in
full view before him. Both men were
bo surprised that they did not move for
a moment. Then the burglar moved
toward the rear door and was gone in
a jiffy. McCoy, having no pistol, could
do nothing.
The burglar had evidently Just be
gun work, as there was no signs of vio
lence on the safe door, although he had
made, all the arrangements for it. He
had thrown his coat over a chair in a
way to hide his body. He had all his
trouble for nothing, however, as Su
perintendent Maloney makes a prac
tice of depositing moneys in the bank

BERKELEY, Sept. 24.â The effort to
secure the adoption of the honor sys

year than last at the university in the
hope that after a campaign of educa
tion the students will approve of the
plan. The honor system committee ap
pointed by Harry Dehm, president of
the Associated Students, is preparing
to continue the investigation begun*
last year. All the larger colleges have
been asked for information upon the
plan wherever it has been tried.
Among the latest acquisitions of the
library are some rare volumes of Latin
Inscriptions and Italian literature.
There are two volumes of De Rossi's
inscriptions and the works of a num
ber of famous Italian authors, among
them those of Mazoni, Guiccardini and
Fosgolo.

the Fortieth, Charles Cook of the For

Upon the completion of nominations

the exception of the Thirty-nfith and
Forty-fifth districts, in which no nom
inations were made, is as follows:

Shortly after the convention was
called to order a recess was declared
to enable the Senatorial conventions
to meet and make nominations. Upon
reconvening the Nineteenth Senatorial
District announced that it had selected
as its candidate Senator Richard J.
Welch. The announcement was greet
ed by loud cheers. Welch undoubtedly
will be nominated by the Republican*
to-day and the Union Labor indorse
ment will add great strength to his
candidacy.
D. W. Barry was nominated for Sen
ator by the Twenty-first District, the
nomination of George B. Keane of the
Twenty-third District by the Republi
can convention was indorsed and
George W. Berger was nominated by
the convention of the Twenty-fourth

greeted the indorsement of Keane's
nomination and he was compelled to
respond to a demand for a speech. He
thanked the convention for its expres
sion of good will and assured the repre
sentatives of labor that he would al
ways keep their interests before him in
the event of his election to the office
to which he aspires.
TICKET FOR ASSEMBLY.
SENATORS NOMINATED.
When an adjournment was ordered,
however, the Thirty-fifth and the'Forr
ty-flf th Assembly districts- were yet to
be heard from on the question of nom
inations for Assemblymen and the
Thirty-ninth had failed to file its pur
ity of election committee as required by
law. This necessitated an adjournment
to the call of the chair and the con
vention will again assemble when these
diliatory districts are ready to report.
But two contests developed at the
convention last night. J. J. Henessey
and Patrick Boyle sought the nomina
tion for Assemblyman In the Thlrt>
second District. After much wrang
ling a roll call was demanded and
Henessey was nominated by a narrow
margin. M. J. Kerrigan and Fred Min
kie sought the nomination for Assem
blyman in the Thirty-tnird District
The roll was called and Kerrigan was
nominated. Subsequently both nomi
nees were indorsed by the entire con
vention.
A leader is lacking In tl'eUnion Labor
ranks, a fact that was thoroughly dem
onstrated last night at (the organiza
tion's convention held irj Pioneer Hall.
For several hours confvfsion prevailed
while Chairman J. N. Copus and Thom
as F. Eagan, who exchanged the gavel
back and forth, tried to force a com
pletion of the work before the conven
tion.

The youngest British admiral is only
eight months old. The infant Marquis
of Donegal is the heriditary lord high
admiral of Lough Neagh, but the of
fice carries with it neither emoluments
nor duties, It is an obsolete naval
command, which dates from the time
of Queen Elizabeth, when it was nec

Lough Neagh to overawe the natives
of Tyrone, Derry, Armagh and An

The Board of Trade Jpurnal of
April 28, 1904, states that the Gover
nor General of Algeria has recently
issued a circular advising the natives
to discard the antiquated plows now
generally in uÂ»e in favor of modern
implements. Of the 2,800,000 hec
tares (6,918,925 acres) in Algeria de
voted to the growing of corn more
than 2.300,000 hectares (5,683.403
acres) are cultivated by natives. If,
therefore, the Governor General's sug
gestions Are adopted â and it is pro
posed to allocate grants of money for
the purchase of suitable implements
â there would appear to be a good
opening for plows in Algeria. â New

OAKLAND, Sept. 24. â Derogatory
remarks about his mother-in-law led
to the undoing: of Charles A. Fosse,
who was the victim of a beating: ad
ministered by William Schwark. a son
of Mrs. Anna. Tietjcn, several days ago.
Mrs. Tietjen is the mother-in-law.
Fosse is her daughter's husband and
Schwark, the son who would not, he
says, permit Fosse to speak slightingly
of his parents.
Fosse gained revenge by prosecuting
Schwark for battery in the Police
Court to-day and securing his con
viction. Schwark, who is a teamster
in San Francisco, was fined 820 by
Judge Geary. He cut his brother-in
law's lip, knocked out several teeth
and in other ways damaged Fosse's
face. AH of the damage done, he says,
was justified by the action' of a "man
who had traduced his mother-in-law,"
as he declared Fosse had done.

The Wiley B. Allen Improvements.
. . Trom ThÂ« W*ip, Sept. 24.
The alteration and remodeling of the
upper floors of the Wiley B. Allen Co.
bulliiing at 931^333 Market, street evi
dence the marked progress that has been
made by this great piano house. The
present arrangement of the building was
found entirely â¢' Inadequate to accommo
date the great j throngs of patrons that
frequent-. this . house, and .as a conse
quence the ' second j floor I is â¢ now in the
hands of the contractors, who are ar
ranging and. - subdividing It into addi
tional reception rooms. When the work
is finished, these departments are to be
elegantly outfitted and furnished.. Here
will be displayed the high-class pianos
of which the Wiley B. Allen Co. have the
Pacific Coast Agency. The floors above
are furthermore- being 1 arranged 'to meet
the demand for larger accommodations,
and when completed the Wiley B. Allen
Co. will be in. a position to provide for
Micir patrons ; arid better display their
high-grade pianos. One of the features
of this mammoth establishment Is its
corps of attendants, whose professional
services arc at -the disposal of those in
flrested in desiring to learn of the ad
vantages and* qualities of the different
makes of Instruments. The house is both
enterprising and' progressive, and has
advanced to the first position â¢ in the
piano trade on this coast. -In addition to
its immense building on Market . street,
given over to J the retail trade.. the com
pany have also a great brick structure in
the rear on Stevenson street, running
through to Jessie street, where the
wholesale department and workshops are
located." There -is one '. thing about the
"Wiley B. Allen Col; and that is the house
aims to make' friends. -Its doors hold
out a welcome to all 'visitors, and the
great and varied stock" is worthy of an
inspection whether one desires to buy at
once or- is- figuring on they future, , or
merely f rum curiosity. .- x

Tong You, a Chinese woman, weigh
ing over 200 pounds, who haa been
confined in a cell in the Detention
Hospital for the Insane for three days,
was discharged yesterday in conse
quence of the reluctance of her rela
tives to swear to a warrant charging
her with insanity. The woman's re
moval from the City Hall was a unique
performance. A two-horse truck
served as a conveyance and into this
the woman was placed and driven
to 613 Jackson street, surrounded by

"What's An a name?" mused Judge.
Cabaniss. Marie Napoleon was before
him on a charge of vagrancy.
' "You know what your great name
sake got," said" the 'judge. ' "He got
.Waterlooed. On the law that history
repeats itself, it , looks bad for you,
Marie." \, . . %

"I'll give the lady a chance to bring
witnesses on September 26," said Judge
Mogan.,
. "Thank you, your Honnah," said the^
accused.- "You're a real ge-man. Every
cullud - pusson on Pacific street' kno^s
me. Mah name is Pearl."
Pearl's . twisted "itself
like a black 'jelly fish expiring in great
agony.' The : look she cast on Petro
\would have made" a weaker man think
he had the "willies." But Senor Marino
looked upon the living nightmare un
awed.'-". j . > - .
"The black senorita she coppa da peso
y. media all right," declared 1 the haughty,
don. And her name was Pearl!
-. ! A trifle less lightly than.Venus rising
from the billows, the short quarter-ton
arose, a mountain ' of \wrath. "Your
Honnah, I don't see how' dat white
trash can tell such lies," she exclaimed.
.."I was jest minding mah own busi
ness,"
."Sit down, madame,". ordered the
court. 'With a sound like thunder roll
lng-away over. the -Marin hills Pearl
settled back into, the chairs. Marino de
clared that while he was chatting with
this b'ulk;of fascination near the Rue
de Hinckley. the â¢ lady coyly separated
.him from $1 BO. : An' expression of in
dignation and reproach three yards in
area was -on' her features as this charge
was made.
Pj With the grace of a load of coal de
scending into a chute she settled her
fairy form on three chairs placed by
the bailiff. The backs of the chairs
bent and the mahogany groaned under
the.strainl And her name was Pearl!
.In a corner Petro Marino^gazed on
thls'i.v'ast-'-expanse of feminine" charm,
and /with admiration. Petro claims that
Pearl plated' her, tiger lily hand in his
vest" pocket and extracted $1 5(T there
from. Pearl's eyes rolled like a pair
of liners in a typhoon. "I 'clars to. good
ness, 'your Hannah,", she said, "dat I
never done stole dat man's chicken
feed. Dat man's statements Is a falsifi
cation, suhV Goodness knows where dat
man 'spects to go when he dies.''
The ace of spades was a snowy white
mark compared to her. â¢ When she en
tered Judge Mogan's court yesterday
it was like the approach of midnight.
She weighed a trifle less than Â¦ a .quar

the airy tread of a young elephant.

Strong was penitent.* "I am consid

turn to the.orchards and the vineyards;
By- gosh, I promise never to come here
again."
:> "Very, i-well,^ Strong," agreed = his
Honor.*! '^Back^tp . the pastures and the
bucolic ; life forVou. Your rugged rusti
cism is out of place here."
J. J. Strong of Stanislaus County was
before Judge Mogan for attempting to
clean out that peaceful highway known
as Bartlett alley. Somebody hit him
while the work was in progress. He is
not sure whether it was a brick wall or
an automobller
Nellie Wallace surveyed Judge Mo
gan with hauteur born of dry vermouth.
She was .charged with' vagrancy and
wanted her sentence immediately. No
Judge could fool her. she declared; she
was golngto get all that was coming.
"Madame, you are intoxicated," said
\the Judge/.
"Sir," exclaimed the lady with wob
bly indignation, "I may be a trifle ine
briated, but I am not intoxicated. I just
went out and had a couple of cock
tails. Are you going to give me my
sentence or must I remain in this place
all day?" '
"You are in no condition to receive
sentence." declared his Honor/
"I- want". my rights," declared
haughty, dame.
"Oh, very well," said the court. "Take
this woman into custody. I will sen
tence her Monday." ;
When Nellie'? dignity and the effects
of the cocktails disappear she will be
sorry she' said it. .
.The case against the petite Mfs. Mar

said that she. had .made a mistake and
that he â¢ had ' made another. For once
two wrongs made a right. Everything
was patched up except the teacup.
"Who, was the court of arbitration?"
asked Judge Cabaniss.
"My â¢; mother-in-law," answered the

According to M. Tellier Jr. the At
lantic has been already crossed in a
motor bout. The feat was performed
in 1903 by Captain Newman, who left
on July 9. accompanied by his son. in
a motor boat named the Abiel Abbott
Low, a little more than eleven metres
in length, fitted with a motor of ten
horsepower. The boat carried 3600
litres of petroleum and 1125 litres of
water and arrived, after a bad pas
sage, on August 24.
Among entries for the trans- Atlantic
< up are numbered that of Baron Tan
ner Gray de Woga.n, inventor of a
paper boat, with which he has already
< ruised the Mediterranean and the
North Sea. He will contest for the
Charley prize with a paper auto-boat
similar to the Qui Vive, which was
built some time ago.
PARIS. Sept. 24. â Following M.
Charley's offer of a r>rize for a trans-
Atlantic auto-boat race, two Paris
newspapers are arranging races in
frail craft. The Matin proposed to
organize a race across the Mediter
ranean, between Toulon Algiers.
The Journal now comes out with an
announcement of a race around the

Just stabled his favorite horse,/ De

work on the track. â¢ . â¢;
A 'strange coincidence was connected
with the horseman's sudden .ending.
Last Saturday at Brighton Beach
track Dekaber won a race, beating Os
trich In a close finish. When the lat
ter animal was led back to the stable
at Sheepshead, the foreman, - Qua
Hanan, asked the stable boy if ( he had
won. Learning that the horse, upon
which he had wagered, a -large sum,
had . been beaten by-. Dekaber, Hanan
threw up.hls arms and fell dead, r
The fire originated in the kitchen of
the Cecil Hotel, formerly the McDon
ald Hotel, on. Queen street and Second
avenue. It swept clean both sides of
Queen street,, between Second and
Third avenues, as far south as the Mc-
Donald 'Trading Company's store on

Because of the intense rapidity of the

. Mr. . Morley is tryirig to *fmd out
where he figures. He ..claims to be
able to double cross any good ball team
in. the league, but ; when he goes
against one of the speckled beauties
he gets his. Four times have his An
gels mixed it with the Commuters this
week and on each occasion theirs was
second money.' It happened yesterday
at Recreation Park, just as It has been
happening right along and the wind-up
wasâ Oakland S, Los Angeles 2.
Errors and sloppy baseball helped.
The Angels made hits enough to win
three ball games, but tliey were not
there on the sack3. Neither could they
give Mr. Baum the support his efforts
warranted. Although the field looked
like the Protrero on a merry day In
June, many hard chances were devour
ed by the Commuters, who were on -the
boards for another high-grade exhibi
tion.
While the fielders did not err, Mr.
Jackson had everything and each An
gel seemed to be on his staff. Once
the misplays happened, Mr. Jackson's
deceptive powers seemed to wane. It
was in the sixth that the Angels got
together and shoved two over the pan.
Mr. Jackson did not show for the next
round, but In his , stead Mr. Graham
took up the unfinished task.
The Commuters did not lose any
time in landing for a pair of runs.
Ganley and Dunleavy ushered the bat
tle in with two biffs to the outfield and
Schlafley bunted them on their way.
Kruger produced a long fly to Eagar
and Ganley arrived handily. But Ea
gar's throw to Flood was lopsided and
while Timothy pawed the mud in
search' of the sphere, Dunleavy wad
dled right ahead till he reached the
plate. Â¦
It went along then till the sixth
without any more damage. Brashear
was given a chance on Schlafley'a
fancy Juggle and Cravath pushed one
through Devereaux. Chase bunted and
Mr. Jackson failed to make a gentle
manly toss to Stark, so it was a full
house and no one in. the cellar when
Toman singled to left',' and scored
Brash. Rosa had a fly which sent Cra
vath in, but the next two were easy. \
â¢ The deadlock only lasted half a
round, for the Cripples were deter
mined. Schlafley tore off a bingle for
a starter, and Kruger dropped a bunt
at the pan. Spies winged to Toman,
who failed to. grab and as the ball
rolled out to center, Sclilafley pulled
up at third.. Mosklman's long fly was
all he needed to score the .winning run.
The game closed with a fast play.
Spies opened up the ninth with a right
field drive and Baum sacrificed. Eagar
fanned, but Flood swung through with
a slzsler to center. Kruger's throw
was perfect- and Spies was stabbed ten
feet from the home goal. The score:

Cavanaugh, the Olympic giant center,
said: "This is twelve years of football
for me. I have played on the Univer
sity of Chicago eleven and on other big'
teams in every sort of weather arid on
fields where the mud was a foot deep.
We were ready to. put it all over Cali
fornia to-day and they -knew It. I
never saw a game canceled on account
of mud."
Olympic will try conclusions, with
Stanford again next Saturday and with
California October 8, Several of the
blue and gold football, men are out of
commission at present, but it is con
fidently expected the aspect of affairs
will change shortly^ and that the pros
pect of turning out a championship
team will become brighter. . Some of
the California students were wishing
for a coach of the caliber of 'Garry
Cochran or of "King" Kelly after the
fiasco of yesterday.
The football game scheduled to take
place between California and the Olym
pic eleven at Berkeley yesterday was
called off for a reason unique in the
history of the gridiron. Two. teams \>t
long-haired youths were waiting and
eager for the fray. A thousand en
thusiasts'had gone to the college town'
from neighboring cities to cheer the
youngsters while they bruised each
other. All things looked auspicious.
Then Coach Hopper, the diminutive
head of the blue and gold, announced
there would be no game on account of
rain and a muddy field.
"Pete" Smith nearly had a spasm
when he was Informed of the change
of plan by telephone. He had already
begun to congratulate himself on the
victon' he expected to- win. His men
were disgusted. The crowd that had
come to see the game was disgruntled
and would not accept the explanation
offered.
No one had ever heard of a football
game being called o-ff by reason of rain.
Easterners who were present .remem
bered that a good field and a clear sky
are rarities for the - big November
games and said Coach Hopper was
afraid that Olympic would do to Berke
ley what she did to Stanford last Satur
day. Some observed that . Hopper
thought his young hopefuls might catch
cold. Others believed he feared "Pete"
Smith's huskies might treat their rivals
in an unladylike manner once they had
them on the field. Olympic and Cali
fornia supporters alike 'were puzzled
and angry to hear that the game was
called off for such a reason as that ad
vanced by the head of the football
board.
Hopper said a gama in the mud would
be of no benefit to bis men and would
afford no interest to the spectators and
that, therefore, he felt it best to cancel
the contest.
Captain Smock of the Olympics said:
"No one ever heard of a rootball game
being called off on account of rain and
mud. Back East we are sure of bad
grounds after the first of November.
If Stanford had beaten us about fifteen
to nothing there would have been a
game to-day. Hopper knows we have
a crack-a- Jack team this year and he
knows we would have beaten Califor
nia. That is why the game was called
off." . " "
Two Academic Athletic League foot
ball games wereÂ»played yesterday on
the Presidio grounds. In the morning
Lowell High School easily defeated
Â¦Wilmerdmg. The score was 10 to 0.
The afternoon' contest resulted In a tie,
neither side scoring. The opposing
teams were Lick and Polytechnic. The
held was covered with water and the
game . consequently slow. Lick ana
Polytechnic are considered the strong
est teams in the sub-league and it is
almost a certainly one of. them will
carry off the honors on this side of
the bay.
In the first half in the afternoon
game the Lick players had a decided
advantage and Polytechnic was 'con
stantly on the defensive. Polytechnic
kicked off and held its opponents for
'three downs. Polytechnic needed but
twenty yards to score, but Lick held
easily and took the ball. Muellon
kicked out of danger. From this time
'.until the end of the half Lick was al
most constantly in possession of the
ball, which was in Polytechnic's ter
ritory.
" O'Connor, Lick's left end, made the
only sensational play of the day. He
tarried the ball around the end for
thirty yards, placing it on Polytech
nic's ten-yard line. The latter held
and secured the ball on downs. Boni
"field was a trifle overanxious and
kicked the ball in touch. The punt
netted his team about five yards. Lick
again worked the ball to the ten-yard
line, but the Polytechnic, boys took the
ball on downs. Bonifield duplicated
h:S first punt, gaining about eight
yards. Lick gained a few yards, "but
was forced to punt. The ball went
over the goal line and Polytechnic
kicked out to the center of the field.
The half ended with the ball in Lick's
possession in the center of the field.
In the second half the ball was in
about the center of the field most of
the half. Neither side seemed able to
guin . any ground -and the ball see
sjwed back and forth. If there was
any advantage in this half It was a
Â¦light one in favor of Lick. The play
of the Polytechnic boys was better
than in the first half, but neither side
.v.-as- good on the offensive. Both Boni
fied and Muellon rmnted well in this
rialf. Few end runs were tried and
what little ground was gained by

CHICAGO, Sept. 24.â Despite the
threatening weather a big crowd took
advantage of the last opportunity of
the season to-day to visit Harlem
track. - A good card of seven races was
offered, with two stakesâ the Prarlo
and the Forwardâ as features. The.
first, ; which ; was badly punctured by
scratches, was won in a hard drive by
Spencerian. After a 'magnificent
stretch effort, he "got up in time to de
feat Stroller by a neck, amid deafening
clamor from the,' occupants of the
grandstand, the majority of â¢ whom
sidestepped the prohibitive odds on
Stroller and played the winner, at -13
to 5. The stake had a gross value' of
$2535, the winner's share being .$2095.
The result marked "Spencerian's six
teenth victory this year. She has
started in twenty-eight races and
has been Outside the money only three
times.
M. H. Tichenor & Cp.'s handsome
black filly Loretta M captured the For
ward stakes for two-year-olds easily
from Lady Savoy, with Sis Lee third.
Loretta M was said to be able to do
great things in the mud and she was
made a strong favorite at S to 5. Sis
Lee had the most speed in the- early
part of the race and showed the way
by a narrow- margin to the stretch
bend. Here Loretta M dashed to the
front; with a few' quick bounds and
simply ran away from her field, win
ning by half a dozen lengths. The
stake had a net value of $2060 to the
winner. t
The steeplechase was a spectacular
affair from start to finish. John T.
Owens scored his third straight vic
tory. Nine horses started. Four of
them fell at various stages of the con
test. None of the horses nor riders
were- injured. Summaries:

Columbus, Ohio, May 19, 1903.
Some four years ago I was suffering
from impure blood and a general run-
doâ- condition of the system. I had no
appetite, was losing flesh, and had an all*
gone tired feeling that toad: me misera-
ble. I began the use of S . S. S., and
after taking seven or eight bottles my skin
was cleared of all eruptions and took on a
ruddy, healthy glow that assured me that
my blood had been restored to its nor-
mal, healthy condition, j My appetite was
restored, as I could jeat anything put be-
fore me, and as I regained my appetite
I increased in weight, end that ' 'tired feel-
ing" which worried me so much disap-
peared, and I --as once again my oldseu.
I heartily recommend S. S. S. as the
best blood purifier and tonic made, and
strongly advise its use to all those in need
of such medicine. Victor Stubbtos.

taken several bottles and the aches and

Ivuropat kin's Character.
Dr. Morgenstern, one of the leading
Russian specialists in medical psychol
ogy, thus sums up the character of
General Kuropatkln: "Kuropatkin is a
mian of extraordinary self-possession.
He has no scruples about reversing a
particular line of policy the moment
he is convlnced'it is impracticable. He
selects his officers only after mature
deliberation, but once he has selected
them he places entire confidence in
them.. His personal bravery i3 phen
omenal: he is ambitious, a man of
large ideas, with the brains to execute
them. He will give a patient hearing
to any suggestion made him,, but acts
entirely acording to his own convic
tions."âNew York Commercial.
Bible Story Confirmed.

Habits of die Woodcock.
It is commonly asserted, and appar
ently with truth, that woodcocks U3e
their bills to assist them to rise from
the gTOund. At first I thought this was
due to the fact that the' bird naturally
bent its head when rising, but on one
occasion when a cock was shot at and
both legs were broken the bird waa
marked down, and it rose again when
approached, which it could not have
done had it not got some assistance
from the use of the bllh These birds
nest occasionally in the north of Eng
land, and when sitting they invariably
rest . the bill on the ground- Another
peculiarity is that when observed the
sitting bird, with head drawn back and
bill resting on the ground, also has its
eyes closed. It would be interesting to
know if she shuts her eyes merely on
the aporoach of an Intruder, or if it is
her habit to sit with them closed, trust
ing solely to the ear for safety.âLon

Jewel Hunting at St. Pierre.
Captain Delano of the steamship Ha
waiian reached this port last week from
Hilo and entertained a group of friends
with a description of AJ junt Pelee, St.
Pierre and Martinique as they are to
day. The volcano Is now entirely ex
tinct and smoke has disappeared, he
says, and the place has come to b 3 very
attractive to tourists, hundreds of
whom visit the scene of one of the
world's greatest tragedies every day.
He states that the search for jewels
and money continues In the ruins, and
will, In his opinion, until every house
site on the island has been raked over a
score of times. The once beautiful city
of St. Pierre is now a graveyard.â

Possible Pla_uo of Locusts.
Egypt Is threatened with a plague of
locusts, and the Government has called
out an army of forced laborers to com
bat the pest. Owing to the young lo
custs' habit of never turning back or
aside when once started in a certain
direction it is possible by digging
trenches, sometimes miles in length, to
entrap the invading hosts and destroy
them. That, of course, must be done
before the locusts take to the wing 1 . At
that stage nothing can stop their rav
ages and they sweep everything before
them. â St. Louis Republic.

TO FULL MOON
An Odd Piece of Money.
A four-dollar gold coin, probably
the only one of Its kind in existence,
is on exhibition at the Germania Na
tional Bank in Milwaukee. It belongs
to Dr. Charles J. Lang and is valued
by the bank officials at $200. although
this is only approximate. The piece
of gold is of the same diameter as a
$? gold piere. but thinner. On its
face is the well known "Liberty head."
without the cap, however. Around
this are thirteen stars interspersed
nith the letters "6 G 3 S 7 C 7
Grams." The exact meaning of theaÂ»?
letters none of the bank officials has
ascertained. On the reverse of the
coin is a five-pointed star, into which
is cut the inscription: "One Stella â
400 cents." Around it are the words:
"II Pluribus Unum, Deo Est Gloria,"
and around these, forming the rim of
the coin, are the words: "United
States of America. Four Dol." About
fifteen years ago this coin was sent to
Washington by the Merchants' Ex
change Bank of Milwaukee, but the
only Information obtained was that
the coin is genuine. â Milwaukee Sen

ONE MAN WHOSE WORK
YOU OFTEX MEET WITH
He Is Commonly Known I>.v the
Unique Title of the Postoflicc
Donkey.
.Search out this man, ride him to the
outskirts on a rail and dismiss him into
the void. He Is the postal official who
has ordered that where a town has a
double name It shall be written as one.
The West Is his especial stamping
ground. He says that La Mesa, for
example, shall be written Lamesa. This
name consists of two Spanish words
meaning "the"' and "table" and they
should no more be joined than the
words New and York in the name
of this city.
A being in our postofflce has dictated
that the American people shall write
of the Blgtrees. Sanfranciseo and Los
angreles and we won't. We know the
fellow. He is llrst cousin to the big
eared employe of the United States
treasury who destroyed the photo
graph of McKinley and other celeb
rities because In the picture was a
piece of paper known as a check which
was about to be paid to the representa
tives of the Spanish Government and
to represent the check in photography
was counterfeiting. Also, he is re
lated to that unspeakable ass who raid
ed the bankers' dinner in Manhattan*,
because the Ice cream was served In
paper boxes rudely resembling piles of
coin. He said they, too, were coun
terfeits.
Oh. we have some rare specimens in
the cages in Washington and they do
strange things whenever they are let
out to grass. But If it comes to send
ing our letters to the dead letter office
because we address them to Kansas
City instead of Kansascity. there is
going to.be trouble and a few rufes for
starting it will be forwarded to Henry
cpayne and c-ther prominent people in
the Dlstrlctofcolumbia. If we have to
carry the matter to Theodoreroosevelt
it shall be carried. We do not propose
to allow the orthographic liberties of
the land of Gec-rgewashington to be
imperiled by a $10 politician fumbling
about as a clerk in the capital of these
Unitedstates.â Brooklyn Eagle.

Wicker Pitches in Eare Form
Allowing the Brooklyn
Men but One Lone Hit
The bark Yosemlte, Captain flynn,
arrived early yesterday morning, twen
ty-four dais from Bristol Bay, with
3040 barrels of salmon for the Alaska
Peninsula. Packing Company. She left
tils x>ort for the north April 25, pre
pared for a good fishing season, but the
lack of success, that appears to be gen
eral this year with most of the vessels
of the fining fleet, attended the Yo
semlte till she pulled up her anchor for
San Francisco. Her fishing crew, both
white and black men, were at logger
heads during the whole season, and as
the fishermen work on a "lay" their
earnings for the ship, as well as them
selves, were exceedingly light. Accord
ing: to a statement of one of the crew,
the men wasted their time annoying
each other, consequently time was lost
and. their pay is small. The bark has
only 1040 barrels of fish.
During her stormy thirty-srven years
of life the Yosemite has figured in sev
eral maritime disasters and has had
many narrow escapes from wreck. Her
timbers are weak and she is considered
t"o be in the last days of her usefulness.
During the gale that recently swept the
Alaska coast she was at anchor at the
mouth of Bear River, in Bristol Bay.
The fierce storm drove directly inshore.
The bark's chains parted and she lost
hÂ»Â»r anchors and several fathoms of
cable. While the vessel was drifting
toward the beach Captain Flynn got
<">ut" the kedge as a forlorn hope. The
Jittle anchor took hold and checked the
oraft's drift shoreward. This brought
her head around, and Just then the
Wind shifted slightly. The crew was
rnabled to set several sails and the old
"bark, faithful to her helm, beat her
way off shore and out to sea.
The ship's carpenter, Tony Everson,
a* Norwegian, died on board and was
buried at the fishing station-
Crusader Reported Captured.
' A dispatch from London to the Mer
chants' Exchange yesterday states that
thÂ« British steamer Crusader, froi_. s
toria to Shanghai, was captured -?Â«p
" tern be r 2 by a Japanese cruiser nd
takfn into Hakodate. A later dispatch
from the office of the Pacific Lumber
' Company. Portland. Or., stated that no
reason for the seizure could be as
signed. The Crusader was loaded with
-a- neutral cargo, was hound for neutral
Yinrtsâ Shanghai and Tientsinâ and was
under a neutral flag.
The vessels course would take her
< lose 10 Hakodate, and it is surmised
.ihat she was merely stopped and
turned from her ordinary course
by the Japanese fleet engaged in exam
ining vessels passing in that vicinity.
The steamer is owned by the Eskside
Steam Shipping Company of Whidby,
England.
Sailing of the Peru.

A kind-hearted landlord gave no
tice that on the first of October such
and-such fiats would have to be va
cated. The wife, of a tenant sought
him in desperate haste, demanding
the reason for the notice. "I have de
cided," he explained, "not to extend
the leases to families in which there
are children. Children are too de
structive, and there are too many
complaints against them." "You can't
put me out," said the woman. "My
husband and I came here eight years
ago entirely alone. My six children
were all born in the flat, they are part
of the flat and belong to the flat. You
can't move us out" He decided not
to molest her. â New York Press.

George J. Gould is enjoying himself
at Lakewood these days. His young
son Jay has had a miniature of the
Missouri Pacific railroad system laid
out on the. grounds of Georgian court
and passes many hours sending trains
on a steel track drawn by a thousand
dollar locomotive that his father gavÂ«
him as a Christmas present. ..I haven't
seen the pretty toy, but I recall the
remark of Henry Clews when we were
discussing an article in one of the
newspapers criticizing George Gould
for spending a thousand dollars on a
plaything.
"Nobody can find any fault with the
gift of a toy engine." said he. "I have
bought many a piece of paper from
George's father with a picture of a
locomotive on it that brought me sor
row instead of amusementâ and wasn't
worth nearly as much, although it cost
me a great deal more." â Washington
Star. \-\ Â¦;.?
Ci ou lils' Son Vses $1000 Toy.
He started in at 7:30 and at 10 o'clock
he was still in the avenue and had not
gone over three blocks. When asked
about it a friendly darky said:
"Why, dat nigger won't done git
home dls night, shuah!" â Indianapolis
News.
When the Colored Fisherman Returns
It's a sight to se a colored fisherman
coming in with a string of flsh and dis
playing it to admiring friends along In
diana avenue. A string of fish, espe
cially if there is a good "cat" or two
among them, makes a Bucktown darky
as happy as if it were a string of pearls.
The other evening just before dusk a
happy looking darky turned into In
diana avenue at the yellow bridge. He
had been fishing up the creek and had
a channel "cat" on his string, the rest
being small "shiners." He had no more
than landed in the avenue when a
crowd of darkies gathered around him
and looked at his fish in great admira
tion.
"Where you all done git 'em, Pete?"
asked one.
" 'Way ui> "bove Jacksons Hole. It's
scandalous how dey do bite up dere!"
Then every darky laughed and Pete
moved on down the avenue, stopping
here and there as the admiring crowds
came out of the stores and saloons to
look at his string.
The yield of the mitsumata paper
plant in Japan frequently amounts to
2000 pounds of raw bark to the acre.
The crude pulp is readily sold at 32
sen (IS cents) the pound. The seeds
alone are sometimes quoted at three
yen (Jl 50) the gallon. As many as
24,000 shrubs are grown on an acre. The
harvesting is done by cutting the
plants off at tlÂ»e roots. The next spring
the shrub grows up again. In fact,
mitsumata* roots a century old. and
still sending up new ihoots. are often
shown. The plant is highly decorative
and is grown as an ornament In some
of the gardens of Japan. â Booklovers'
Magazine.
The cultivation of paper plants In
Japan )a a very Important Industry.
As is well known. Japanese paper of
various kinds is in demand throughout
the world. Recently American and
European manufacturers have been
giving some attention to the possibility
of producing from Japanese paper-pulp
some of the numberless useful articles
and toys similar to those in vogue In
the island empire. To that end Japan
ese paper shrubs are to be planted in
America and in the countries of South
ern Europe. The United States Depart
ment of Agriculture, which recently
sent experts to secure seeds of the mit
sumata plants, is to- make extensive
experiments in growing this particular
ly valuable variety. It is believed that
this shrub will thrive In Florida, Louis
iana, in irrigated parts of Texas and
the Colorado Desert and m some sec
tions of the Sacrament6 and San Joa
quin valPeys in California. Should this
introduction of the Japanese mitsumata
plant into America prove successful it
will bring fortune to many farmers.
Rice planters, particularly in Texas â
the climate of which, it is believed,
will prove suitable to the valuable
exotic â could set shrubs out along the
unoccupied dikes and on all the narrow
strips of land dividing flooded fields
and secure profitable returns from the
enterprise. The American experts, who
have been investigating the subject in
Japan, are inclined to believe that
when the mitsumata plants are grown
successfully in America and American
machinery is invented for the conver
sion of the pulp Into paper, that pro
duct will be put to many uses not
thought of In Japan. >'Â¦

"I heard last week,"- said Professor
Gates of Harvard, "a good example of
double entendre. There was a man
who had been courting a woman for
five or p!x years. This man, It was
plain, loved the woman; he called on
her five nights In the week, but in that
shy mood common in Kew England he
could not bring himself to propose.'
"He sat one evening opposite his
sweetheart He had grown quite bald
since hJs courting had begun and, as
for her. little lines had appeared about
her mouth and eyes, and she stooped as
she walked. Very desperate she was.
It reemed to her that they might have
been married five years ago.
" 'I seen,' said the shy lover, 'I seen
an ad to-day for a suit for $10.'
" 'Was it a wedding: suit?' the woman
asked In a strange voice.
" No,' he answered nervously, 'it was
a business suit.'
" 'Well. I mean business,' said the
woman."â Exchange.

Tho most extraordinary pearl â or

""the Southern Cross," owned by a

who value it at $500,000. So far a3
is known, it occupies an absolutely
unique position. It consists of nine
pearls, naturally grown together in so
regular a manner as to form a perfect
I^atin cross. The pearl v/as discovered
by a pearl fisher at Roebourne, West
Australia. The first owner regarded It
with so much superstition that he
buried it; but it v/as discovered in
1S74 tind five years later was placed
on exhibition in Australia.

the Lotus Yacht Club gave it a real

A $10,000 Bible.
Schuylerville, a town up State near
Glens Falls, claims the distinction of
having a resident who is the owner of
an old Dutch Bible that, as he has
recently learned, is a very valuable
book. He is Harold B. Silvey. and a
few days ago a New York bibliophile
made him a generous offer for It, and
more recently he has declined offers
ranging from $6500 to S9000. The
last offer was made by a man, also
from New York, who went up there
especially to buy the book. As it is
a family heirloom, Mr. Silvey says he
is in no hurry to sell It at present.
He also believes that the book may
become more valuable, as he says it
is one of the only two of its kind ever
published. The other is now owned
by a wealthy book lover in New York.
The book, which was printed in the
year 1736 at Anne, is ten Inches, by
twelve inches and is sixteen inches
thick." It weighs about fifteen pounds,
is mounted two heavy brass
locks used as clasps and is in a fine
state of preservation.

from Winston and Browndale and the

at Mr. McCaskey's factory, where it
was transformed into curd. The curd
was hauled to a car near the depot
and placed into molds of the cheese
and pressed. The cheese weighs "100

Uses Victoria's Great Seal.
Although Queen Victoria has been
dead for several years, yet, astonishing
though it may appear, her great seal
BtJll continues to be used for the seal-
Ing of all official documents. This Is In
accordance with precedent, and has led
to a good deal of confusion among his
torians, since ancient documents are
often found bearing the seal of sover
eigns who have died as many as ten
and fifteen years prior to the date re
corded therein. The new great seal of
King Edward will not be ready until
the end of this year, and, instead of be
ing made of silver, as has always been
the case since the days of William the
Conqueror, near 900 years ago, it is for
the first time being made of finely tem
pered steel. It consists of a pair of
dies six inches In diameter and three
quarters of an Inch. thick. When it Is
required for the completion of any state
documents the dies are closed, melted
wax is poured in and the great seal is
ready to be attached to the document
to which it is to give official value. â

will consist of "fishing" for submarines

the experiments a netting 200 feet long,
made of thin but strong steel wire, is
to be attached to three steam pinnaces,
and by them drawn under water at the
depth which it. Is known submarines
usually travel. When one of the little
craft becomes entangled in the meshes
the two outside boats will, close in
around it, and so. force it to come to

In the year 1882 there were 10,921
breweries in Germany, while in 1901, al
though the production of beer in
creased, the number of breweries de
creased to 6674. Since 1901 the decrease
in the number has been N even. more
marked. The indications are that brew
ing is an occupation which it Is more
profitable to conduct on a large than
on a small scale. The Internal revenue
commission of the German Diet Is now
endeavoring to frame a law which will
protect small brewers against large
ones. This may make it possible for
the small brewer to continue to do busi
ness in spite of competition.â New York

the Import of tools had more than
doubled, having Increased from 245
tons to 526 tons, and that in the sec

becomeeven larger. Special emphasis
is laid on the fact that the United

per cent on German machines, against
the German tariff of five per cent, and
they insist that German machines are
in no wise inferior to the American,
and that there is no need whatever

in Callao, it ascends the narrow valley
of the Rimac, rising nearly 5000 feet in
the first fifty-six miles. Thence It goes

the first time a client ever objected
to my fee.
"You know I defended Gibbons for
arson and put in some tremendous
work for him. He was convicted at
the trial, but we couldn't help it, and
I took the case to the Superior Court
and we lost there, then on to the Su
preme Court and that affirmed the
conviction and he has been given ten
years. Now, my fee only amounted to
53000 and the scoundrel actually had
the audacity to grumble about It, say-
Ing it's too high. What do you think
of that for Impudence?"
"Well," said O'Conor - slowly, "of
course, you did a lot of work and $3000
is not a big fee, but to be frank with
3'ou, Mr. Conkllng, my opinion, founded
on mature consideration, Is that he

The Admiralty has made the extra
ordinary blunder of appointing a dead
man to an honorary post at Liverpool.
There is a dignified announcement in
the London Gazette that the Admiralty
has been pleased to appoint Dr. "John
Charles Ryle, Bishop of Liverpool, as
honorable chaplain of -the newly
formed Mersey Brigade of the Royal
Naval Volunteer Reserve. Dr. Ryle,
however, died on June 10, 1900, and the
present Bishop of Liverpool Is Dr. Cha

Pccket Money Men Carry.
An' investigation of how much pock
et, money is carried by different people
as" a safeguard against the unforeseen,
emergencies of daily city life may be
counted on always to afford some Bur
prise.
In a group of six men who compared
notes in a downtown cafe the other
day the sum total of the emergency
fund was $2t> 58, making an average of
$4 43 for each man, but of this amount
one man carried a $20 bill in his wallet
and another a $5. bill. A third had $1
tucked away and a fourth kept a 50
cent piece In his watch pocket, which,
he explained, was always there, and
which was sufficient to send a tele
gram or use a phone. These four car
ried the same sums mentioned as a
regular habit. "I have 8 cents loose In
my pocket," said the next witness. "It
may be $2 or $3 to-morrow, and the
next day some other sum. I never
really thought of the matter before,"
The $20 man regarded him with a mix
ture of pity, admiration and awe.
"This is all I have," said the last
man, who happened to be the wealth
iest of the party, and he held up two
exchange tickets. "I've always taken
It for granted that in case of need I
would be able to raise money, even if

What has been considered by Com
missioner General Sargent the most im
portant point in his annual reports is
the recommendation to Congress for
legislation for the erection of certain
buildings at Ellis Island, New York,
and at perhaps one or two other immi
gration stations for the use of the sev
eral States in disseminating informa
tion regarding their attractions for set
tlers. - This recommendation, has been
repeatedly made by every Commission
er General since if was Introduced to
the attention of â¢ Congress by Herman
Stump in the administration of Presi
dent Cleveland. It was repeated by
Powderly and reiterated by Sargent.
Nothing has been done by Congress
with the recommendation, and it is be
lieved at the Bureau of Immigration
that the question of distribution of the
immigrants landing on our shores dur
ing each year will not be satisfactorily
settled until proper : action has been
taken along the lines suggested.
The plan is to invite the several
States to make use of the buildings
that may be erected, by the Govern
ment, filling them with all manner of
information concerning the territory
covered by each commonwealth, having
officials in charge, maps, scales of
wages, lands for sale or open to settle
ment and any other features that may
be calculated to Induce the Immigrant
to go into the country and there begin
his career as an American by adoption.
Many of the States are desirous of
large influxes of immigration and are
waiting for just such an opportunity to
invite the right class of people to come
to them and make their homes. Par
ticularly Is this so of the South, the
sluggishness of the development of the
natural resources of that great terri
tory being entirely due to a lack of
proper labor for the work. With these
things in mind the Commissioner Gen
eral will again this year reneat his
recommendation to Congress for the
necessary legislation that will accom
plish this end and effect a reform In
the immigrant after he lands at Elite
Island.
Year before last, when the high tide
of immigration to the United States
was reached,; nearly one million aliens
reaching these shores during those
twelve months, the average of educa
tion and other desirable attainments
possessed by the immigrants was about
as low as could be legally passed by
the immigration officials. The new
comers to the country consisted large
ly of Poles, Austro-Hungarians and
Italians, and the majority of them re
mained in the large cities of the coun
try rather than, as do the Swedes,
Norwegians and English, immigrate to
the less thickly settled portions of the
land and there make their new homes.
TWO CLASSES OP IMMIGRANTS.
At the same time it was noted that
these immigrants Svere mostly ex
tremely" illiterate and disinclined to
adopt the habits of the native Amer
ican. Many of them came from coun
tries where they had been persecuted
by the public officials and had there
fore a hatred for the police, consider
ing them their natural enemies. This
enmity it was found difficult to eradi
cate and the consequence was that a
very undesirable class of Immigrants
v/as thrust upon the grea^ cities,
which were forced to aqcept them.
The class coming during the year
ended June 30, 1904, was of a much
higher order, being composed of many
English, Germans, - Swedes, Nor
wegians and kindred nationalities. As
a rule these people desire to migrate
to the West, there taking up land
when they can and settling down to
an agricultural life. They are held to
bo very much more desirable than the
classes which remain in the cities and
there take up the trades which they
may have practiced In their former
hemes or adopt new ones, according
to the circumstances by which they,
find themselves surrounded ' in their
new environment.
INFORMATION' FOR SETTLERS.
In the forthcoming annual report of
the Commissioner General* of Immi
gration two important features will be
made public. First, the report is ex
pected tÂ© show that there haa been a
decrease In the Immigration to the
United States In the past fiscal year.
Second, it will positively be shown
that the immigration has been of a
much higher class of people than was
the case in the last and preceding
years.
The Indian Ocean is frequented on.ly
in the north by lines out of India and
Indo-China, and a little in the west
by liners from Oceania, which call at
Colombia, and then make straight for
Australia. Two ; lines, each with a
steamship a month, -follow a slender
lane frbm Australia to Cape Town.
The Pacific is the Sahara of the great
seas. Saving only the steamships from
the Far East to California and Brit
ish , Columbia, a line from Sydney to
San Francisco, and a one-horse line
(with sailings four or five times a
year) betwen Tahiti and the United
States â pave for these mere ribbon
like streaks the Pacific is a desert.
Only a few native canoes ply daring
ly from island to island in archi
pelagoes girted round with coral reefs
â veritable ocean graveyards, the ter
ror of seafaring men.
How many shins of which we have
received no tidings, and of which not
so much as a drifting spar haa ever
been picked up, have been dragged by
Irresistible winds into those solitudes
Â¦of -ther South Pacific no. one will ever
lufow, .ror' the ocean guards its prey
full well. â Washington Post.
It is generally supposed that by
reason of the universal Increase of
maritime traffic the sea is everywhere
furrowed by vessels. This is a mis
take. Ocean commerce has grown
enormously during the last half cen
tury, but that development is* due to
the substitution of steam navigation
for he old fashioned employment of
sailing vessels. When the first steam
er began to churn the water with its
paddle wheels the sailing fleets ceased
to increase. With the advent of the
screw propeller they began to decrease.
The gradual but constant disappear
ance of sailing ships made the ocean
more of a desert than before. Sailing
vessels had their established routes in
accordance with winds, currents and
seasons. The gaps between the routes
taken by the outward bound and home
ward bound ships were often consid
erable. Moreover, the capricious ele
ments not infrequently played the
mischief with nautical instruments
and as a result the field of operation
for ocean ' shipping was vastly ex
panded.
This is no longer true to-day. The
liner goes straight ahead, in defiance
of wind and wave, the ports between
which she plies are great industrial or
commercial centers, whither come
numberless railways, serving as pro
longations of the lines of navigation.
Freight cars carry their loads of mer
chandise to the lesser ports and the
cities of the interior. The railway has
killed coastwise navigation.
The ocean- highways are therefore
anything but numerous. The most fre
quented of- ..oceans is the Atlantic.
Apart from the Polar Seas, we see
that in its northern part there is only
one desert zone â a dreary waste of
waters between the routes from Eu
rope to the United States or Canada,
and those from Europe to the An
tilles. In the south, between the
rentes from South American or the
Western American coast and the
routes from South Africa, . extends a
desert occasionally traversed by the
steamers of the line from Cape Town
and Mozambique, which, when the cof
fee season is at its height in Brazil,
cross the Atlantic for cargoes at Rio
Janeiro and Santos.
PACIFIC THE SAHARA.
These deserts lie unforgotten be
twixt the narrow ocean highways
traversed by vessels. In such waste
places of the sea a disabled ship,
driven out of its course by a hurricane,
may drift for months, tossed by the
ceaseless ground swell, without being
able to hail assistance. Her only
chance of escape Is the possibility that
some ocean current may drag her into
a more frequented region.
MORE OF DESERT NOW.
There are deserts on the ocean' as
well as on the dry land: â vast wastes
upon which the eye of man has never
rested and which have seldom, if
ever, been crossed by the ships of
commerce. The waves on these
wastes have never been parted by the
prow of a sailing vessel or lashed by
the propeller of a steamer; immense
solitudes, where the flap of a sail is
never heard nor the strident cry of a
siren; veritable deserts, whose si
lence is broken only by the howlingr of
the -wind 'and the roar of the. waves,
which have been vainly pursuing one
another since -the day of creation.
Time was when the colored man was
the only safe, sure waiter for the com
mercial hotel and the Imported waiter
was the choice for the fashionable
place. Now waitresses are displacing
the colored waiters In; many places
where formerly the service .of. the for
mer would have been deemed totally
impracticable. You may ask any hotel
proprietor or manager why It is that
he employs girls, and you are told
that the guests prefer their service,
and here (wages also . considered) is
the sum total of the argument why
waitresses are now so much employed.

The British House of Commons re
cently discussed a proposition to con
vert Great Britain's existing Board of
Trade Into a Department of Commerce,
and" to make the chiefship a Cabinet
roeitlon. A commission appointed to
consider the proposed change has re
ported recommending it.
One of the immediate results would
bÂ« a vecv considerable addition to the
salary of the chief of the board. It is
now about $10,000, and the proposed
salary is 125,000. Some one - suggested
that the secretary be a merchant. Ger
ald Balfour combated this idea and
said that, if one followed such a line
of reasoning, Great Britain logically
ought to have a sailor at the head of
the navy and a soldier at the head of
the army, an arrangement the nation
has persistently refused to make. This
may not be logical, but it accords with
the facts.
The change contemplated would lead
to a reform that, according to Gerald
Balfour, is very much needed and
would prove of great practical value.
During the discussion it waa argued
that in future the Consuls, although
entirely dependent upon the Foreign
Office, ought to report directly both to
the Department of State and the De
partment of Commerce. The latter de
partment would write to them direct
and get direct replies. A copy of every
letter and report received by the De
partment of Commerce would, how
ever, have to be sent to the Depart
ment of State. Consuls would be com
pelled to serve for some time in the of
fices of the Department of Commerce
for the purpose of familiarizing them
selves with the work and the questions
with which they will have to deal.â

Then, too, the Utle would evoke mem- I
cries of the ill -fated King of Rome, son j
of the first Xapolecn and of his Aus- <
trian consort, the Empress Marie ;
Louipa. Some of the features of the ;
ead I;fe of the young Prince who bore
the title of Kins of Home and who had
been â¢ invested therewith at his birth
are familiar to the American public
through Rostand's popular play,
"Â¦L'Aiglon" (""The Eaglet"). Somehow
br another this title of King of Rome
has always been associated by people
with everything that is unlucky and ill
fated, and the title cf Prince of Rome
resembles It loo closely not to arouse
misgivings as to the policy of investing
therewith the son and heir of King
Yirtcr Emmanuel and Queen Helena.
The present King himself bore the
title of Prince, of Naples until his ac
cession to the throne. But it was not a
pupu!ar title, just by reason of Its be
ins in a measure usurped, since it
served to call attention to the fact that
:hp first Kin^ Victor Emmanuel had
taken advantage of the revolutionary
movement of Garibaldi against the
'Bourbon King of Naples to annex the
U ttrrs dominions to his own.
Prince of Piedmont is assuredly the
m<j*-t appropriate title for the hope of
â¢the house of Savoy. For Piedmont is,
f<> to pneak. the cradle of its race. The
r* igning house is above everything else
Ptedmontese. and there is no doubt that
among the sturdy, stalwart, taciturn
and bluntly honest hlghlanders of Pied
mont there is a feeling of more pro
found loyalty and whole-souled devo
tion to the reigning family than In any
other part of Italy.
. The baby of Â£ueen. Helena of Italy
will receive the titlf of Prince of Pied
mont, borne by King Humbert, his
grandf2'her, vchile Crown Prince. Both
King and Queen abandoned their for
mer intention of Investing the child
with the title of Prince of Rome, and
it wa? partly with a view of avoid
ing certain associations with the unfor
tunate son of Napcleon I. that arrange
ments were made for the Infant's birth
to take place at Racconigi rather than
in the Eternal City.
It is said King Victor Emmanuel has
come to the conclusion that to style
his son ani heir Prince of Rome would
be something akin to tempting fate.
For. in the first place, such a dignity
would handicap the Infant from the
very outset of its existence with the an
tagonism cf the Roman Catholic
church, since the title in itself would
constitute a perpetual reminder of
what is regarded by the Papacy as an
art of sacrilegious usurpation and tend
to interfere ylth those negotiations that
are now in progress with a view to a
modus virendi between church and
state.

that community makes his breakfast of
a cucumber, his luncheon of a carrot, a_

He never touches flesh or fish, weara

A new feature, in Scotland this year
that promises well for the future Aug
ust sport there is the breeding of wild
ducks. A driven wild duck presents
as difficult a shot to the crack gun
ner as a driven grouse and the birds
can be more certainly driven over, the
guns from a hill loch than from the
low lying lakes in the English coun
ties, where that branch of sport has
hitherto been most successfully intro
duced and followed. And one great
recommendation in its favor, which
should lead to its wider adoption in
grouse counties, is that the sport can
begin earlier in the holiday month of
August than grouse shooting com
mences on the surrounding . moors. â

Snakes may almost be said to have
glass eyes, inasmuch as their eyes
never close. They are without lids and
each is covered with a transparent
scale much resembling glass. When
the reptile casts its outer skin, the eye
scales corae off with t! e rest of the
transparent envelope out of which tho
snake slips. This -'assy eye scale is
so tough that it effectually protects the
true eve from the twigs, sharp grass
and other obstructions which the snake
encounters it its travels, yet it Is
transparent enough to allow the most
perfect vision. Thus, if the snake has
not a *Â»'ass eye, it mav. at anv rate,
be said to wear eyeglasses.â New York

At a recent medical exhibition in
London a new anesthetic, called som
noform, was 'shown. It is a liquid
whose "boiling point" is 2J degrees be
low zero. The moment it comes in
contact with the air it becomes a gas.
The exhibitor broke a glass capsule of
somnoform to illustrate its character.
As soon as the glass was chipped there
was a rush of what looked like steam,
and seven Dence worth of somnoform
was loose in Queen's Hall trying to
asphyxiate the exhibitors. Its great
virtue, from a medical point of view,
is that breathing stops before the heart
when it is administered. â New York

Railroad Fined for Throwing Eggs.
Because certain railway employes
joined with other unmannerly persons
in throwing bad eggs at an unpopular
political candidate, who was . awaiting
a train at Shelby, N. C, the Superior
Court gave judgment for the plaintiff
against the railway company for $4500
damages, and the Supereme Court of
the State has just affirmed that de
cision. Strict justice would seem to
say that the individual egg throwers
should pay for their malodorous
amusement, instead of their imper
sonal and innocent employer, but the
liabilities of railway companies are
many and peculiar. â Express Gazette.
A novelty in flat building has recent
ly been introduced in this city and it
Is by no means certain that it will
prove popular. Some of the newer ele
vator houses are supplied only with
a service stairway. The tenants are
expected to use the elevator on all oc
casions. This new way of putting up
houses has the advantage of making
the elevator service more than usually
effective. But there are persons with
a prejudice in favor of a staircase
which they can get at, whatever there
may be in the rest of the house. The
new scheme economizes both space and
money, but the builders are not sure
that it will ever become a fixture in
New York's method of flat construc
tionâNew York Globe.

The Alabama tribe has affiliated with
the Snake Indians, and is still more
backward in accepting association with
the white man. For a long time they
refused to be enrolled on the loyal
Creek rolls, but of late many pf them
have been persuaded to come forward
and enroll. The prophet is the big man
of the tribe. When a horse is stolen he
is supposed to be able to find It, or if
Indians become sick he is expected to
make them well. If a drought-over
takes the land he is expected to make
it rain. He brews or makes all the med
icine for his tribe. Pottery making,
which is a lost art with the Creek In
dians to-day, was possessed by the
members of this tribe until a few years
ago. The last survivor of the old school
in the making of pottery was an old
woman who died a few years ago. â

The Alabama Indians in the Creek
Nation are so primitive in their ways

one of the forty-nine different tribes
composing the Creek Nation that does
this. None of them can speak English.

The marriage of Count Herbert Bis

at Vienna and it was on this occasion
that the Kaiser took a step which has

wrote to Prince Reuss, German Em
bassador at Vienna: "Should the
Prince (ex-Chancellor) or his family

fine yourself to conventional forms of
courtesy. This order is also to be ob

goes of it, and although twice as much
is imported by England as was import

the manufacture of golf balls.âPhila

Until about ten years ago the subma
rine cable companies used practically

it is not affected by salt water. But
when the game of golf became the fad

An extraordinary story of the im
position of one will upon another was
told before the psychological section of
the British Medical Association at Ox
ford recently. Dr. Eldridge-Green said
that he was talking with a patient on
the subject of hypnotism. The patient.
a lady of more than average force of
character, said she defied any man to
send her to sleep and make her do as
he wished. "I told her it was not
necessary to send her to sleep," said
the doctor, "and added, "You will wake
at 5 o'clock to-morrow morning and
will send me a postcard despite your
own wishes to say no.' I got that post
card. It was somewhat to this effect:
*I have been trying not to write to
you, but I did wake at 5.' "

A correspondent of the London
Chronicle tells of an incident he wit
nessed in the theater of the Crystal
Palace, where Cardinal Manning was
addressing an immense meetins of
members of the League of the Cross,
a temperance organization, which was
very near to his heart. "I will con
fess to you," he said, with that mix
ture in his manner of the playful and
the Daternal which his Irish children
loved, "that I do not practice what I
preach. I am not a total abstainer
myself, because my doctor won't let
me be one." At once a voice came
from the topmost gallery, "Change
your doctor!" "Thank you for the hint,
my friend," promptly said the Cardi
nal; "I will." What is more, he did,
with the result that he was a teeto
taller ever afterward, refusing all stim
ulants, even in his last illness.â New
York Tribune. -V r
The Cardinal Changed Doctors.
In June. 1504, a poor telegraph clerk,
Alfonso Giovannelli. was sitting in his
modest house trying to think how he
could add to his stipend of %ZO a month
so as to educate his children. At that
moment a bright little fellow of 7 years
bounded Into the room, singing at the
top of his voice in a kind of refrain,
"How happy we shall be when the cod
icil is opened, when the codicil is
opened." His father gazed at him for
a moment, and then with a whoop
sprang out cf his chair and fled from
the house, shouting, "That is it; that is
it!" The history of Prince Giovannelli
was well known to him, and the boy's
words illuminated the fact that the mo
ment had come to open the ancient tes
tament. His lawyer said that there
might not be anything to benefit him,
but it was worth while reading it".
Lawyers and emissaries were sent to
Prince Alberto, who had never heard
of the codicil, who scoffed at the idea
<jf any sueh document and looked uoon
it all as a conspiracy to get money
from him, but the Naples lawyers were
not to be stopped, ami. having an Idea
of ihe date of the document.
koou found it, musty and yellow with
age, covered with the dust of centu
ries. They carried the information to
the Prince, who was incredulous, but
seeing is believing, so he was obliged
to consent to be present at the open
ing, which took place 'with great sol
emnity in the presence of the repre
sentatives of the rival Giovannellls and
thf city authorities. The contents were
ind*rd dramatic. They set forth that
when the chief branch should be, ex
tinct all ihe xÂ»osst?ssiona of the house
The Principino, as he was called, was
then formally adopted by both Prince
and Princess, confirmed by royal de
cree, but their efforts to induce King
Humbert to give him legally the title
and name of Prince Giovannelli were
long and arduous, as the King was
much opposed to giving titles in this
way. The Giovannelli and Chigi influ
ence at last proved potent, however,
so the adopted boy is now legally Prince
Oiovannelli.
Years passed. Princess Giovannelli
died and left Prince Alberto all her
considerable dot which came to her as
a Princess of the house Chigi; then the
old Prince also died and also left every
thing he possessed by will to his son,
making him one of the richest of the
rich young aristocrats of Italy.
We must now go back 200 years. A
certain eccentric Prince Giovannelli in
1703, feeling his end near and having a
fantastic worship for his own name,
left a will and a codicil, the latter to be
opened by the head of the cadet branch
only when the chief branch of the house
should be extinct. The codicil was de
posited in the archives of Venice.
Prince after Prince married and had
sons, and the old codicil was forgotten
except by those whom it most con
cerned. In a distant and poor branch
of the house, which was also prolific,
the words "we will be happy when the
codicil is opened " became a legend.
OPENS THE TESTAMENT.
The palace, however, was large, and
the Prince, instead of leaving the city,
thut himself up with his son in a little
uted wing of the building, and for
weeks the husband and outraged wife
never met. Meanwhile Princess Gio
vannelli ate her heart out in solitude,
deprived by her pride of both husband
and child, whom she had worshiped.
One day. in passing to her gondola, she
heard through an open door a little
voice lisping, "Where is mamma?"
This melted the ice and a moment af
ter she had the boy in her arms and
was herself in those of her husband.
He then told his story. The little Al
berto was really his son, born of a
poor girl who died in childbirth, and it
was only his desperation at his wife's
condition which induced him to deceive
her.
"So." she said, "you dared impose
on me. a Princess Chigi! Take the
Â«hi!d away and do not let me see
either of you again!"
BECOMES RECONCILED.
What was to be done? The Prince
wrung his har.ds, but suddenly he
sprang to his feet and seizing his cloak
he hurriedly left the paiace. An hour
later he returned and in his arms was
a boy, a month old. Princess Giovan
iielli, in her weakness, did not notice
the size of the child, and she recovered
and nursed the babe and loved it as
her own, knowing no difference, and
giving him the name ot Alberto.
Two years later a domestic was an-
Rrily dismissed by her, and in revenge
tcld her that the child was not hers.
Then ensued a terrible scene with her
husband.
"Is the boy yours?" she demanded.
"He is," he replied, very pale.
"But he is not mine," she cried, and
he could not deny it.
"Only one thing can save her," said
the doctor, "if she comes to know that
her baby has not lived her case is
hopeless, but if you can give her an
other it may save her life."
VENICE, Sept. 24.â About thirty-five
years ago all was confusion in the great
<iiovannel!i palace on the Grand Canal
in Venice, where the Princess was
thought to be dying. Through the
magnificent Gothic windows was to be
seen one of the fairest and gayest
scenes on earth, the bright blue waters
sparkling in the sun, reflecting the
fairy-like palaces and churches, the
gondolas floating by, while not a sound
was to be heard but the dip of the
r.ars, the culls of the gondoilers and an
occasional sor.g.
But inside the palace there was the
bound of weeping, for the long and
eagerly expected heir had been born
only to close his eyes in death, and
bis mother, it was thought, would soon
follow her little son.
There are even burglars with classi
cal tastes, astonishing as the statement
may seem, as was proved not so long
ago, when J. G. Henson, a Manchester
gentleman, fancying he heard a noise
in the house, stole, quietly -downstairs,
and, opening his library door, found a
man ensconced in an armchair, ab
sorbed in the Odes of Horace.
"I was so amazed," said Mr. Henson,
"at what I saw, that instead of calling
for assistance and giving him into cus
tody, as I suppose I ought to have
done, I entered into conversation with
him."
"He told me that he was literally
starving and that, as he saw my li
brary window open, he couldn't resist
the temptation of getting into the house
to see if he could find anything to eat.
On turning up the gas he saw my
Horace lying open on the table and he
yielded to the temptation to revive old
memories of his Rugby and Oxford
days. I' found him a most clever and
entertaining fellow and his story was
so pitiful that I gave him a good meal
and sent him away with a sovereign in
his pocket. A few months later he re
turned the sovereign and wrote to tell
me that he had found his feet again,
having got a good appointment as.mas
ter in a school."â Tit-Bits.
OXE READ HORACE.
But all messages are not addressed
by any means to the master of the
house, for a certain lady, known to the
writer, not long ago received this hint
from a gentleman of the jimmy:
Dear Madamâ I hope next time' I
honor you with a visit you, will try to
persuade the old gentleman not to
snore so loudly. I find his vocal efforts
very disturbing in the practice of my
profession.
Douglas Jerroid used to tell the story
of a friend of his, a lawyer, who came
down one morning to find his house
stripped of everything that was valu
able and portable. To add insult to
injury, the burglar had left this fare
well message behind him:
A lawyer's thief, so some folk say,
'But oh! how wronged is he!
He steals his client's purse, 'tis true,
But hands it on to me.
I am sorry not to have had the pleas
ure of saying good-by in person. As
some little compensation for my disap
pointment I am venturing to take a
few mementoes of my too brief stay in
your home.
A burglar who paid a recent visit to
the house of a Yorkshire Squire was
evidently none too pleased with the
fare that had been unconsciously pro
vided for him, for before retiring he
penned this note:
Dear Sirâ One good turn deserves an
other. Take my tip andâ change your
cook. Yours faithfully,
ALGERNON FITSIMMONS SIKES.
But all burglars are bv no means
courteous to their hosts, as a certain
gentleman in the Midlands can testi
fy. This gentleman, who is a doctor,
had unfortunately provided nothing
for his uninvited guest but a soli
tary bottle of .Inferior. claret. =., : In the
morning this bottle was found among
his drugs with a label attached, on
which was this message:
Dear, Sirâ As this bottle had evidently
strayed from your surgery I have re
placed it. Give it to your patients and
it'll make your fortune. In a mistaken
moment I drank a tablespoonful. I am
now going to arrange with an under
taker.
BURGLAR TURNS POET.
Another gentlemanly burglar, who
had apparently spent an agreeable
hour in a certain house in a West End
square, left a visiting card behind with
the letters "P. P. C." penciled in the
corner, and on the back were these
lines:
It is quite a mistake to imagine that
the burglar who has a weakness for
paying us surprise "visits at unconven
tional hours is necessarily the coarse,
bullet-headed, low- type man so com
monly pictured. He may be and often
is a man of gentlemanly exterior and
of education, who would seem much
more in his element in one's drawing
room than climbing through a kitchen
window.
That he can be polite, if satirical, has
been proved over and over again by
the messages he leaves behind for the
benefit of his unseen host, many of
which are treasured at New Scotland
Yard.
It is not long since one of these noc
turnal gentlemen, who had paid an un
expected call on a well known author,
left behind him this message on the
library table:
Dear Sirâ It is a matter of regret
with me that your taste in wines is not
as good as your taste in books. If it
had been 1 should have spent a still
more delightful time under your hos
pitable roof.
The writer of this message, who was
arrested a few weeks later, proved to
be a university graduate, who, in his
honest days, had himself written more
than one promising volume.

As the Chesapeake oyster crop has
grown annually less, the general de
mand has grown annually greater.
The oyster appetite prevails from the
Alleghanies to the Rockies, and the
great interior has in the past looked
to the Chesapeake Bay to meet the
demand for the savory mollusk. But
in recent years this general demand
has been supplied largely from the
bayous and estuaries of the gulf
coast. The inlets from the Long Island
Sound and those that indent the coast
of New Jersey are also producing an
output of high-grade oysters that is
increasing 'constantly from a careful
a'nd intelligent system of artificial cul
ture. Many of these Northern beds
are supplied with young oysters from
the Lower Chesapeake, especially from
Virginia waters. Original propagation
has been adopted in many of the
Northern waters where the natural
supply had become almost extinct.
Notwithstanding the fact that the oys
ter product has been increased vastly
in other sections by artificial breed
ing, the present price of the oyster is
double that which prevailed a genera
tion back. It is to be feared that the
oyster may in time ( become a high
priced dainty instea'd of a general
article of diet. â Baltimore American.

CHICAGO, Sept. ,24.â Failure of foreign
grain markets to respond to the sharp ad
vance here yesterday caused considerable liqui
dation in the wheat pit when trading- began.
Sentiment was quite weak. Initial quotations
on December were off %@%c to l',i@l%c at
$1 12% to $1113%. May was a shade higher
to %Â®%c lower at 1 .13% to $1 14%. Shorts
took' advantage of the break and covered free
ly, forcing up prices to about last night's clos
ing figures, December selling up to $1 13% and
May to $1 14. The advance was not held,
however, renewed profit taking causing a mod
erate reaction. In addition there was some
selling on a denial of the rumor Â¦ that the
French Government contemplated reducing the
Import duty on wheat. A report of the Cana
dian Minister of }he Interior also had a de
pressing influence. According to that- official
the cfrop damage stories regarding the situa
tion In Canadian Northwest were gro*Â«ly ex
aggerated. The total yield of Manitoba and
the Northwest Territories." it was claimed
would aggregate from 55,000,000 to .C0O0O-'
000 bushels of good quality wheat. Toward the
latter part of the session sentiment suddenly
veered to the bull side. An unconfirmed rumor
or possible complications in the war situation
lnvclvin: Great Britain and itUBsIa caused ac
tive covering by ehorts. Offerings at "the
time were light, December selling up t& $1 U".:
0314%. May rallied to $1 1571. An advance
of nearly three cents in the. price of the De
cember delivery at St. Louis, and export sales
there of cash wheat of ?1 20 a bushel, had
considerable effect on speculative trading hero.
Reports of good flour sales in . the Northwest
also wero an additional bull factor. , During
the lost half hour mostot the gain was lost,
renewed profit taking causing ; a ' decline" of
over %c. The close, however, was firm, with
December %o higher at $1 14%. ' Final <quo
tatlons on May were.%c up at $1 15V4@1 15Â«.
Corn was weak early, but became decidedly
strong late In the day, on a bullish report of
a well known crop expert making a still fur
ther reduction In the total yield. December

Flour and Millstuffs.y
Some time ago over 200,000 quarter sacks of
Flour were sold by; northern parties for Aug
ust-September delivery on this market. The
current deliveries of this Flour have stood In
the way of an advance In California Flour,
but they are now pretty well closed out. and
when they finally arc It is expected that Flour
will again advance here, provided Wheat keeps
up. Otherwise there is nothing new.

market for Potatoes and Onions, but dealers
were not inclined to force sales, expecting that

of the storm, and good stock was firmly held
at previous prices. Sweet Potatoes were a
little firmer, stocks being rather light.
- Fresh receipts of Tomatoes were light owing
to . the storm, which checked picking In . all
the -growing districts. Prices had a hardening
tendency and c>ld stock, which was. plentiful,
cleaned up pretty well. Lima Beans were a

Cucr.tlal market and banking 'interests dls
.trlbuted a larse amount of *tocks on the bulge
last week. They are working together on the
bull side, however, and regard the general
situation and outlook especially from the

market as favorable to higher prices. We be
lieve the tr.arket may ultimately sell at a,
much higher level than the general list In the
