loan of $17,00^. Mrs. Chadwick also
gave her note to Nissen for the loan,
but the note having been renewed time
and again Nissen finally sold the rope
of pearls. To the question by Gross
man whether there was any Jewelry in
Europe, Mrs. Chadwick replied: "There
is some in the hands of Wolfers Broth
ers of Brussels."
"What is that transaction?"
"That was jewelry I bought abroad
and left with Wolfers Brothers to set.
It was not paid for, as it was pur
chased tinder contract, to be paid for if
it suited. Wolfers Brothers sent their
bill and I paid $10,000 on it. The job
was to take about a year. They are
now suing me."
"What was the cost of this Jewelry?"
' I do not remember exactly. I think
it was between $150,000 and $200,000."

"I cannot say without the papers."
"While you were in New York the
last time you sent Emil, your son. to
the Cleveland Trust Company for a
package. What was in that DackaÂ«re?"
"Just letters. Some that do not re

that -elated to the property in Europe.
To get money in New York I had to

Before this loan was paid. Mrs. Chad

because of renewals at increased inter
est and commissions.
Mrs. Chadwick was asked if Iri Rey

former Wade Park Bank, owed her any
money. She replied, "Not a cent." To
the question if she owed him anything
6he replied that it was only a small
amount. She would not give the fig

for it.
Asked If she had ever made any loans
to deceive Chadwick's brother in Jack

that she had not. She said that she
had paid him some $12,000 or $15,000
due the Chadwick estate, and that he
had no property belonging to her. She
added that the doctor's brother in Min

SERGEANT ELLIS AND TWO
OF SQUAD MEET LIKE FATE
Poheim Casts
a Negative
Ballot.
President of
the Board
Dissents.
New Official
Is Not Yet
Named.
George W. Wittman was relieved of
| duty as Chief of Police by a majority
j vote of the Board of Police Coramis
| sioners last night. The verdict of Com
missioners Drinkhouse and Reagan
! was that he was guilty of neglect of
duty in not suppressing gambling with
i in the confines of Chinatown, also that
' he was incompetent as head of the mu
j nicipal criminal bureau. President of
â  the Board Poheim vote : . in the deposed
Chief's favor.
With Wittman went Sergeant
Thomas EH is and Patrolmen Henry
; Heinz and Richard R. O'Brien. Ellis
: was in charge of the Chinatown squad
at the time gambling is alleged to have
been conducted in an open and notori
! ous manner. Heinz and O'Brien were
; subject to his orders. All three con
| fessed to the Grand Jury that they had
j accepted bribes to neglect their duty,
i although this fact was not brought out
| during the trial of their cases before
! the Police Commissioners. Policemen
William Doran, Charles Munn and
Henry T. McGrath, who were the other
| members of Ellis' squad, but who em
phatically denied that they had ever
i received money from any corruption
fund, were "given the benefit ol the
| doubt," but fined $100 apiece on general
1 principles.
After the meeting the Commissioners
' said that the election of a new Chief of
! Police had not yet been discussed.
j There have been many rumors, and the
I names of several possible candidates
have been mentioned from time to
time.
The verdict rendered in the case of
Wittman last night did not come as a
surprise, and discussions as to who
would fill the vacant chair have been
frequent. From what one of the Com
missioners said last evening it is likely
that no appointment will be made until
after the Mayor names another Com- i
missioner to succeed Henry Hutton, re- i
cently ousted.
>'O PLAN OUTLINED.
Neither Wittman nor his attorney, I
Congressman -elect Kahn, would state '
positively what course will be taken. It
is certain, however, that Wittman will
make a strong: fight to regain the posi
tion. During the trial of the case,
which dragged along for many days,
the defense had a stenographer, and
the indications are that a legal battle
will follow. Wittman will contend that
he was not accorded a fair and impar- i
tial trial and that the evidence in no
respect sustains the verdict. Commis
sioner Poheim is of the same opinion
in the latter respect, and thinks that
the charges against the Chief were not
proved.
Wittman took his defeat gracefully. I
He thanked President Poheim for his
vote, declared his innocence, and re- j
lated his efforts to make the San Fran- '
Cisco Police Department outshine those I
of other cities In the United States. His '
work had reaped its reward, he said i
and he could leave the department with i
a clear conscience. During the process
of dismissal Commissioners Drinkhouse
and Reagan remained silent, except to
answer when the secretary called the
roll. Their findings in the case were
! typewritten and the paper was handed
i to the secretary to read.
When the meeting was called to order
the three Commissioners retired to the
ante-room and remained in consulta
tion some time. When they again took
J their seats the case of Wittman was
j called, and Reagan handed the follow
ing to Secretary George Boyne to read:
FINDINGS ARE READ.
"In the matter of George W. Witt
man, Chief of Police, on trial before
this board for incompetency and neg
lect of duty:
"We find that from the 7th to the
i 28th day of November, 1904. gambling
was carried on openly and notoriously
in that section of the city known as
the Chinese quarter, situate and lying
within the following boundaries: Sac
ramento street on the south. Pacific
street on the north, Stockton street on
the west and^ Kearny street on the
east.
"And we further find that gambling
in the above named quarter can be
suppressed, and it has been suppressed
from December 1. 1904. up to the pres
] ent time, and that for the ten years'
' last oast it has been suppressed at in

tervala when the proper effort was
made to do so.
"The evidence introduced in the trial
of the accused, George W. Wittman,
Chief of Police, shows that a proper
effort was not made to suppress open
and notorious gambling within the
above specified dates, to-wit: From the
7th day of November to the 29th day
of November, 1904, in the above named
quarter; and
â¢â¢TherefoiÂ«e we are of the opinion that
the Chief of Police, George W. Witt
man, was incompetent and neglectful of
his duty as charged in not suppressing
it, and we so find.
"JOHN A- DRINKHOUSK.
"THOMAS REAGAN,
"Police Comtoisaionera."
Commissioner Poheim voted not
guilty. He said that he Relieved that
gambling was conducted in Chinatown,
but that the evidence produced during
the trial of the Chief could not impli
cate him in any charge of neglect in
not stamping it out. When a vote was
called for on the penalty Kahn arose
and entered an objection on the
ground that the board had no Juris
diction inasmuch as the charges had
not been proved. The objection was
quickly overruled ami a moment later
Wittman knew his fate. Drinkhouse
and Reagan answered "dismissal as
Chief of Police" when their names
were called, and Poheim refused to
vote. Arising from his seat Wittman
addressed President Poheim thus:
"I want to thank you, Mr. President,
for your vote In this matter. Now, no
one knows better than I do that the
facts sustain you in your position.
"I have been with this department
for twÂ«nty-four years, and in all the
ranks that I have held I have never
committed an illegal act. My jpreatest
ambition was to build up this depart
ment to be one of the best in the United
States. How far I have succeeded was
shown at the International Consrress of
Chiefs of Police held at St. Louis last
June, where they elected San Francisco
the place to hold their next lnterna- 1
tional congress. This is an interna- 1
tionai association of chiefs of police
from the United States. Canada and
Mexico. That action has been rescind
ed now.
"I have received many letters from
various chiefs of the international as
sociation, saying that they intended
to elect me president of that associa
tion when they met here that summer.
Of course that is all off now, and I go
out of this department.

ELLIS ALSO DISMISSED.
When the ex-Chief had passed from
the room the case of Sergeant Ellis,
already found guilty, was called. His
attorney made the same objection as
Kahn and the same ruling prevailed.
Commissioner Reagan then said to El
lis: "Sergeant, this is the most un
pleasant duty I have had to perform
since I became a Police Commissioner.
Had you shown any disposition to as
sist this commission in gathering evi
dence during this investigaton I would
be inclined to be lenient with you and
permit you to retain your position on
the force. You did not, however, and I
have but one penalty to impose and
that is dismissal from the department."
Both Drinkhouse and Poheim voted
likewise and Ellis lost his authority.
Heinz and O'Brien followed and their
stars were unpinned from their coats.
When the case of Patrolman 'William
Doran was called, Reagan said that
the charges had not been proved to his
satisfaction and that the officer's frank
conduct on the stand was an evidence
of hts Innocence and greatly in his fa
vor. For this reason Reagan and the
other Commissioners voted to impose a
fine of $100. Munn and McGrath were
served likewise and after the excite
ment had subsided the Commissioners
took up their routine work.
Sergeant Shaw was found not guilty
of having made an illegal arrest and a
communication from the Grand Jury
calling attention to the fact that pool
rooms are running In the city was read
and acted upon. Captains of police
were ordered to place blockades on
some of the poolrooms and this will be
done to-day.

The last of its three narrow chambers
of death has been sealed until earth
"shall pass away and the mausoleum at
Palo Alia now holds within its hard
vails of heavy stone all that was mor
tal of the illustrious and potent family
â which bore the name of Iceland Stan
ford. Yesterday afternoon the remains
of Mrs. Jane I^athrop Stanford were i
laid away in the sepulcher of marble to |
sleep the wakeless sleep between hus
band and son who had gone from life
long-waiting years before. The sur- j
cease to her tears through the many
reasons of bereavement had been the
dream of a reunion of family ties and j
Affections, and over the thousands of j
bended heads came the gladsome ;
thought yesterday that her earnest !
â prayers had been answered. --. .
â¢ Nature strived its utmost, it seemed, i
. to shed its benediction at the close of j
the earthly career of one whose life had
been so pure and sweet and had |
; wiought so much for good. The sun j
bad swept the heavens clear and the
warming rays tempered _ the gentle
â  breezes into balmy zephyrs. The ver
dure of spring clothed the landscape
and surrounding hillsides in richest
garb, and blooms and blossoms told
strikingly of the glory of the God that
had been so devoutly worshiped both
In word and by deed.
The last rites over the dead were
most tilting. The wishes that Mrs.
Stanford had indicated were carried
â â¢jut in every particular, and on every
hand there was refinement of taste, j
simplicity of ceremonial. The attend
ance or the five thousand mourners
alone made what there was of an'im
posin? nature. There was precision in
the conduct of all arrangements, no
mishap or misunderstanding marred
the solemnities, and with quiet, unos
t*nu*tious service the good woman was
laid away to her sleep of peace. Depth
of sincerity' was manifest in all the
demonstrations. The sorrowing and
stately processions of mourners passed
with heads bowed down, -emphasizing
the grief of those who had, most of
theni, come from afar to pay their last
tribute Of respect. I-;'.-: ; :~

The breadth of Mrs. Stanford's hu

performed the rites. The Christian in

creed no less earnest for man's uplift

The 1500 students of the university,
the young men and women that the
berel t mother had taken unto her love
and her generous care, gave proof of
devotion that was 2 almost filial
like. .'.'She was like a mother to all of:
us," was the way a young athlete ex
pressed himself with quavering voice.
j From the time the crowd began to
arrive on the forenoon trains the
young men students were about the
cttmpus. Courteously they met the
visitors bent on -sad mission,, gave
whatever information was desired, but
the rollicking spirit of the college boy
was. gone. .. . .
The young woman students were no
less plunged in gloom, lor the saddest
of all the day? of their mourning had
come. The several hundreds of them
were dressed almost all uniformly in
white. The seniors wore â¢ the eisss
gowns of black, but aside from these
; the only display of black was in belts
and- ties.
The students marched in procession
behind the hearse- from chapel- to
sepulcher and no sentiment of rever
ence could be prettier. Only a few,
ho were detained by illness, left the
ranks of the student body Incomplete.
These were the children that had
taken the place of a son's affection^ in
Mrs. Stanford's warm heart mid they
rendered unto her memory all the ten
der thoughts of love and devotion that
a son or daughter might have done. ; j
MRSS BERXER GRIEF-STRICKEN .
Among those who had been mem
bers of Mrs. Stanford's household
there were sad twitching* of the heart
strings. Miss Bertha Berner, for
twenty years her private secretary,
had -to be supported by her brother
during the short march from the man-
Fion ;â¢ to the . Memorial Chapel. - " Ah
Wing, the Chinese, who had begun ser
vice as cook and later assumed almost
complete charge of the household, be
ing in Mrs. Stanford's employ over
twenty years, was a grief-stricken
mourner. About the crown of his hat
he had' deftly â¢ - wound -: a display : of
crape. He" came with his; nephew,
Young, and -together they were given
places among the principal mourners.
Wing had , journeyed from , San Fran
cisco to show his last respect for the
dead.,.- -,'.. :-, ... :-;V ." :;-.; '-:;â --'-'.â 'â â .
In some measure there was formality
at* the funeral. A "delegation" from the
Legislature came to pay respects for
I tho State of California. Municipalities,
j various State bodies and a diversity
of organisations sent representatives to
pay formal tribute. The activities of
Senator Leland Stanford and of Mrs.
Stanford had been large during their
i lifetimes, and to honor the memory of
j both came men and women from all
sections of California to bear testimony
â  of affection and respect that honorable
careers had won.
There were no services at the man
sion near the university, where the
body had lain since it was brought
back from Honolulu. Only relatives,
intimate friends and the pallbearers
were admitted there when the coffin
was removed and placed in the hearse.
There was a slow procession to the
chapel, and here, in the beautiful house
of worship Mrs. Stanford reared with
so much zeal to the memory of her la
mented husband, the services, simple
and brief, were said over her mortal re
mains. Pwev. J. W. Dinsmore of San
Jose, who had dedicated the chapel,
and one of those in whom Mrs. Stan
ford reposed her greatest confidence as
a friend, gave a eulogium that was
happy in its cholca of sentiment. Va
rious other ministers of the eospel par
ticipated in the ceremonies.
From the ihapel the hearse pro
ceeded a half-mile to the mausoleum,
followed by a procession <^f the throng
of mourners, and with simple i cere
mony occupying but a few minutes the
body was consigned to rest in its tomb
of stone.

The services held in the Memorial |
Church were deeply impressive. The ;
great stone sanctuary built for the |
students by Mrs. Stanford in memory j
of her husband, was crowded from,;
door to door by sympathetic friends,
faculty, students and alumni. â¢ Long
before the doors opened the people be
gan to gather in the corridors of the
quadrangle, and when the hour of serv- ,
ice came thousands of men and wo
men were waiting in line. Reservations
in the church had been made for all â¢
the personal friends of Mrs. Stanford â¢
and for all those connected with the j 'â 
university, but there was scant space
left for the general public. Within a ,
few minutes after opening the en
trances were shut to visitors, all the
seats having been filled, leaving huh- j
dieds to be turned away.
Inside the church the congregation j !
was arranged in divisions. In the gal- j
leries sat the 1500 men and women
students of the university, the juniors
and sophomores to the right and the j !
seniors and freshmen to the left. *rhe
front seats of the main floor were re- ! |
served for the honorary and intimate j i
pallbearers. Back of these were seated j :
the faculties of Stanford University i '
and of the University of California, j t
Then came the body of alumni from i |
this university and the representatives : ]
from many organizations. Those of J ;
the general public who were able to j ,
obtain admittance were seated in the <
west transept.
ARRIVE AT CHAPEL.
At ha If -past 1 o'clock the great bell's
in the dome of the church were tolled. '
They announced the hour "of the fu
neral service. A sudden hush fell upon
the solemn audience as the door of the
vestry opened and the little company
of seven ministers of the gospel, all
dressed In black, flowing robes, tiled ,
down the chancel steps and, marching 1
two by two, walked up the center aisle
of the church. Bishop Nichols led the
participating preachers, all of them in
timate friends of Mrs. Stanford. Slow
ly they paced to the open bronze doors
in front, there to receive tne body and
small procession that had come with
it from the mansion. The congrega
tion aros"e of one accord and remained
standing while the. old white-haired or
ganist played Chopin's funeral march.
Softly at first, then rising gradually as
the funeral procession entered, the sol
emn music of the great organ filled the
church. Tfcjfc casket was carried for
ward and gently placed in the center of
the white marble chancel. Behind the
body marched the intimate pallbearer*, j
the board of trustees of the university j
and many of the close friends of Mrs. I
Stanford. Then followed the relatives
and the members of the household.
While the audience stood with heads
reverently bowed. Organist 8.. C
Blodgett played the choral song of
Mendelssohn, atid the choir at 100 stu
dent voices took up the strains and
softly sang:
To thee. O IÂ»rd. I yield my spirit.
Who brcataes in love this mortal chain.
My HfÂ« I hut from thee Inherit,
And death becomes my chlefest gain.
In thee I live, in thee 1 die.
Content, for Thou are ever nigh.
AT THE MARBLE ALTAR.
The funeral services were very sim- |
pie. The casket containing the body i
of Mrs. Stanford lay in the' center of I
the white marble chancel, resting on
a black mat. The afternoon sun shone
through the wealth of stained glass
windows, reflecting its warmth on the
mosaics of the interior, which in turn
reflected a halo of golden light around
the bier. In front of the casket was
the great altar and on it a white
statue of the Virgin Mary looked sor
rowfully down upon the dead woman
who had been such a benefit to the
world.
Back of the altar were figures of
the twelve apostles, seemingly ani
mated by the soft rays of the after
noon sun. There was no profusion of
flowers anywhere in the church. The
floral decorations were extremely sim
ple. The casket was covered by a pall
of violets and lilies of the valley, deli
cately entwined with maidenhair ferns.
i
On one side stood a cross of Easter
lilies. It was lettered in flowers.
"Auntie." and "ypas the token of Miss
Jennie Lathrop, the niece that Mrs.
Stanford loved so well. On the other
side was a broken wheel made of La
France roses and g-alax. Here and
there along the chancel were scat
tered bunches of orchids and white
roses. On either side sat the seven
ministers who participated in l>he ser
vices, their long: black robes in strik
ing contrast to the white figures of
the apostles.
Rev. William Kirk Guthrie of the
First Presbyterian Church of San
Francisco offered the opening: prayer.
At the close of which Organist Blod
g-ett played a memorial anthem writ
ten by him upon the death of Mrs.
Stanford. Rabbi Voorsanger of the
Temple Emanu-SSI of San Francisco
took the first lesson from the twenty
third psalm. "The Lord is my shep
herd. I shall not want." Rev. E. R.
Dille of OaTtland read from the Book
of Corinthians. Bishop Nichols led the
congregation in the Lord's Prayer.

Probably such a one as Mrs. Stanford, whom I
I many regard as specially fortunate, as one
I who had everything to enjoy and little to i
suffer, even of her it may be said, that if, I
fifty years ago, shn could have foreseen alt
I that she had to suffer, she would have been |
profoundly depressed: *he would have shlv- |
i ered and shuddered under the dark clouds rvf
I anticipation. She bad her (sorrows no lees keen,
probably far more keen, than those of thÂ«
humblest servant In hÂ»r employ.
There is no fellowship more common to
man than the fellowship of suffering. This
brings all to the same level. The heartactie
of a millionaire is just like that of a hod
carrier. The tear on the cheek of a Princes* .
Is chemically the same as that on the cheek
of the washer-woman. No worthy man or
woman ever >Pt got through this world with
out trials, which, If foreseen, would have
changed, possibly rnwert the spirit. This is
shown in all the real biographies of the
world, in the Bible and outside of it. So ono
of your own poets (Sophocles) has said:
"Still the long days have brought
Griefs near and nearer yet.
And joy a, thou canst not see
One trace of what they were."
So our own Shakespeare, that greatest un
inspired delineator of human, nature and
human experience:
"If this were â seen.
The happiest youth viewing his progress
through.
What perils past, what crosses to ensue.
Would shut the book, and sit him down to
die."
Our lives may be said to be a series of
surprises, punctured at frequent intervals with
shocks â startling and oftin urriftc shocks, la
j one way and another, in forms more or le~?
severe, these shucks come to all of us in
our lives. Such a shoek â gn>at. sudden,
startling, stunning â has come to this univer-
I sky, to this commonwealth, to this country.
I in the departure out of this world of the
noble woman whose body now lies here. In
this magnificent <"hurcti. which her bounty
erected "to the glory of God and In loving
j memory of her husband." Of her sudden
and sorrowful taking off. with its puzzles
and problems, tt does not become me to ray
one word. All that I must leave to others.
Only this I may say, that In common with
multitudes of 'others, near and far away. \
sincerely prieve that her passing was not in
the quietness and peace of her preferred home.
her beautiful country seat near this spot,
where no doubt manj of the sweetest asso
ciations of her life had their center. It i 3,
however, a comfort to know that, while she
wan a world-round traveler, it pleased God
so to order it that she should pass away un
der th* flag of her own country, the country
she loved.
LOVED THE "PLAIN PEOPLE."
The Sunday after her death It was my prlvi
lega In this place to give voice to the public
estimate of the character and life of Mrs.
| Stanford. I 3hall not repeat what was then
I said, except to reaffirm It. She lived a long
life, with varied experiences and amid various
scenes. Daring the greater part of her life
her path lay on the higher levels as regards
I wealth and prominence. But the glamour of
this world never dazzled her eyes nor made her
blind to the really higher and nobler ends of
human existence. She -never lost her sympa
thy, her fellow feeling with those who livpd
on the lower levels; with those whom Mr.
Lincoln called the plain people. Like her
Divine Master she was never ashamed to call
them her brethren. Where Is the poor man
who ever cried out against her injustice or ex
actions? Where is the widow, whose heart was
ever wrung; or the orphan whoso eye v>-ji.Â« âºvtr
wet, because of any oppression or grinding; of
hers? .
She was exceedingly catholic in her sympe
thles, as was shown throughout her life. as_is
evident from the provisions of her will. She
was In close and vital touch with whatever
was pure, good and holy. Probably some en
vied her: perhaps some even bated her, simply
because she v.as rich. , - Well, . that is thÂ«
way of the world: It is certain that her heart
was not set merely on material good. ShÂ« and:
her distinguished husband' had great plans for
tha. good of posterity, and of mankind. ' This
university is their monument. .No doubt, the
central and, controlling purpose of her life, was
to carry out the alarm of her husband and her
self â  concerning . this institution. In the lone
liness of her childlessness and widowhood this
was the central and supreme ambition of her
soul: the ambition to found a great, university
where "the children of the ;.- common people
might receive an education equal to' that with
in reach- of tmÂ»- highest; an Institution mag
nificently .endowed, yet most- democratic: â %
place where one is rated not â  according .to â  htÂ»
birth or fortune, but simply by his merit: a
place where the son of a day laborer stands on
the same - level as > the - Â«on ;of thÂ» millionaireâ
this Is the basis of this university. 'â¢ â  ;
Here lies an honored body. It 1* the mate
rial remains of a great, potential and useful
life. At last we all come to this.
"The boast of ' heraldry, * the ' pomp of power.
And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er
.- , .' gave, -- , -â  . '- " ".-
Await alike the inevitable hour.
'â¢ The paths of^gkiry lead but- thÂ« grave-." '
. No doubt Mrs. Stanford had her Joys. deep,
pure, ; bounding. T No doubt, also, she had her
sorrows. . During the .years of her childless
ness ; and - widowhood she - must have *!*pt on
memories as, sweet, as holy, and as painful as
death.' Hope usually governs the horixon of
youth, while memory governs that nt age. fn
Mr*. â¢ Stanford's- case. however, , memory â  and
hope .were . beautifully , blended. The memories
of th-a past. , so â  warm, "so : fresh, so vital; the
shadÂ«-i r of ; the blessed dead.' to her so near, so
living, ; so - companionable â ; filled - half : of
her horizon. 'Then, s the great purposes;. and

RI(JHT Cll of. LARGE WEALTH.
Here is a sreat fortune devuted to the wel
fare of mankind. Here is a fountain opened
tn this western land to carry refreshment to
vist regions of the earth. Here we have a
sinking example of the right use of large
weaitH. The body of Senator Stanford sleeps
quietly 'â '.< yonder mausoleum. The body of
his son lies by his Jide. Now. we are about
to lay thf body of the wife and mother be
tween th*-m. Th*y are dead, and their faces
shall no more be seen, nor shall their volcas
be heard anu.ng nrrcn. But their works do fal
low tli-ni. This $rreat university shall live
while the earth endures. Here thousands and
t'Tis .>f thousands of youth shall gather In the
con, ing years: along these corridors they shall
walk; o\er this campus they shall stroll; to
thesÂ«? rooms they shall recit*; in these libraries
th>-y shall read; iri this great church they shall
worship: and from hence shall go out. through
all coming time, streams to refresh the land
and to bless the world.
They do rest from their labor*, and th*ir
works do follow them.
Rev. C. M. Hill of Berkeley pro
nounced the benediction, after which
the audience passed out of the church
to form the procession to the mau
soleum.
There was a notable lack of ostenta
tious mourning decorations at Stan
ford. No crepe adorned the buildings.
The women of the university dressed
in white with black bows of ribbon
around their necks. The casket was
borne by eight students, each a wearer
of the varsity "S," and a small bow of
black ribbon to signify their position.
A sad feature of the funeral services
was the absence of Rev. D. C. Gard
ner, chaplain of the university. He
was Mrs. Stanford's favorite minister,
and she had expressed the wish that
he would be able to preach at her fu
neral. Fate, however, had decreed
otherwise, and he lies very ill at his
home. References* were mad* to his
friendly relations with Mrs. Stanford
and to his work in the university, while
prayers were offered for his speedy re
covery.
San Jose Citizens Mourn.

remains of Mrs. Stanford through the
Inner <uiadrangie and into the chapel.
STpOO WITH HEADS UNCOVERED
Great crowds stood on the sides of
this short line of march. The men
. with heads uncovered, while the
Â«romÂ«a bowed as the body of the great
benefactress was slowly borne past
them. The procession was headed by
'Yv pallbearers, who walked two and
.breast with stately meln.
n followed the coffin. It was
'I with a pall of purple violets,
f th<? valley and maiden hair
fern. Charles Lathrop followed imme
y behltid. He was deeply bowed
-ief, and it was with the greatest
difficulty that he kept back the tears.
HiÃ wife was by his side. Then came
h'-r mem bore of the fami!y, with
Mies Berner's carriage" immediately fol
â  jr. She was deathly pale, and it
apparent that but for the firm
support her brother offered her It
i have been impossible for her to
her feet. As she passed along
on all sides could be heard expressions
â apathy for the woman who just
passed through euch a siege of terrible
suffering. Ah Wing, the old Chinese
house factotum, also came in for in
spection and quiet comment. He fol
lowed along with his head raised and
his countenance expressed the fact that
he was fully cognizant that he
was one of the centers of attention.
He was plainly, almost poorly dressed
in black, and carried In his hand a
black soft felt hat with a heavy band
of crape about it.
Mis? May Hunt, Mrs. Stanford's maid,
and Miss Nora Hopkins, the house-
maid, walked tog-ether. As soon as the
funeral party had passed through the
quadrangle friends and representatives
of organizations fell "into line and the
cortege moved into the chapel.
CROWDS ARRIVE EARLY.
The crowds that came to attend the
ceremonies began arriving early. The
first installment reached the steps to
the chapel at 8 o'clock, and there they
camped until the doors were opened,
at 1:30. The limited capacity of the
chapel allowed seats to only a few out
side of the students and those invited to
take part in the ceremonies, so it was
but a small number of the early ar
rivals of the general public that gained
admittance. This left fully 5000 peo
ple on the outside. For a while those
lingered around the entrances, listen
ing to the soft tones of the organ, but
the majority soon began to wend their
way down to the mausoleum, where
they took places of vantage, in order
to witness the ceremonies that were
to take place there. Those who re
mained in the inner quadrangle sat on
the steps or walked about, conversing
in subdued tones upon the great beauty
of the buildings and the bounty of her
who had made them what they are.
Hundreds brought their lunches with
them and sat under the great oak trees
during the noon hour in sort of picnic
fashion.
Every phase of society was repre
sented in this great gathering, and all
joined harmoniously in the one thought
and one Idea â to pay homage and re
spect to the founder of the university.
BACON'S WORDS OF SYMPATHY.
Berkeley Professor Eulogizes the Life
of Mrs. Stanford.
BERKELEY, March 24. â The life
and career of Mrs. Jane Stanford were
the subject of eulogistic comment at
the semi-monthly university meeting
in Harmon gymnasium this morning.
Professor Thomas Bacon delivering
the address in which Mrs. Stanford's
work was referred to with praise and
admiration.
President Wheeler left this morning
for Stanford University to participate
in the funeral services for Mrs. Stan
ford there and in his absence Profes
sor Adolph C. Miller, Flood professor
of economics and commerce, presided
at the meeting. Professor Charles
Rieber, a former member of the fac
ulty at Stanford and an Intimate
friend of Mrs. Stanford, was to have
spoken at the meeting here to-day,
but was prevented by illness.
Professor Bacon's remarks were, in
part, as follows:
Although my personal acquaintance with
Mrs. Stanford was very slight, I may still ven
ture to spr-ak a few words on her life and
work. Hers was a life begun under humble
circumstances, fraught with desolating sor
but unc that became synonymous with
pÂ»-nerusity. kindness and helpfulness. She waa
one of those women who are too good for this
world.
As President Wheeler has said, when all the
story has been told, we ahall *cc what a great
) .eroine she really waa. Her struggle to main
tain the university's existence during the few
dark years following Senator Stanford's death
marks her as one of the most level-headed
and practical of women.
Singleness of purpose and eel f- abnegation â
thÂ«-F- thing 3 Mrs. Stanford exemplified In her
later years. And for these she should be loved
and remembered for ages to come. How great
her (services to higher education have been is
inestimable. The founders of the Stanford
Vnlverf=lty did more for California than If all
thp millions had been bestowed on this Insti
tution. The competition has made us great ;
it hae given us stimulus for scientific research
and higher Ideals. Had it not been for the
founders of a higher Institution California Uni
versity would have remained the same ob
â¢cure institution It was twenty years ago.
E. T. Colton of the International
committee of the Y. M. C. A. delivered
a short address relative to the world's
work of the association he represents.
CLAREMONT, March 24.â Word was re
ceived to-day by President Gates of Pomona
College that Andrew Carnegie had donated
$40,000 for a library to "be erected on grounds
owned by the college.

BELOVED SON
AND HUSBAND
Final Scenes Marked
by Simple Cere
monies.
Doors of Mausoleum
Ciose While the
Choir Sings.
While the solemn services were being
held in the Memorial Chapel the throng
of visitors in the inner quadrangle be
fore the stately edifice grew larger and
formed in two compact masses with a
center lane leading from the large dou
ble doors to the outer quadrangle. Or;
the steps between the quadrangles peo
ple were standing, while three-quarters
of a mile away at the mausoleum hun
dreds were gathering to obtain com
manding positions.
As the deep-tcned organ played the
Aye Maria the doors of the chapel were
thrown open and the great congrega
tion inside surged out. The first in the
funeral procession from the chapel
were the students who formed in pic
turesque squads, according to their
classes, on the eastern side of the great
oval.
In the meantime the other partici
pants in the march to the tomb came
filing from the chapel. First came the
resident graduates, the church choir,
led by Joseph Smith, and later joined
by the organist, TB. C. Blodgett, and the
alumni, all of whom passed down the
livi/ig lane to their assigned places in
the funeral cortege forming on the
oval.
The gilt hands of the chapel tower
clock pointed to 3 when the faculty and
university trustees, walking at slower
pace than the preceding mourners,
moved out of the chapel. The deep
toned bell in the tower solemnly tolled
with measured clang the knell of the
university's benefactress, as her body
left the sacred structure on its jour
ney to Its final resting place.
THOSE IX THE CORTEGE.
No ltss solemn and pathetic was the
sight of the group of relatives and
friends and the retinue of domestics
of the departed. In the compact com
pany that followed the bier came those
who had directly felt Mrs. Stanford's
kindness, constantly seen her face, and
often heard her voice. To them the
blow was bitter and blinding tears at
tested their grief in the loss of one who
had long been their friend.
Directly behind the casket came
Charles G. Lathrop and his wife, fol
lowed by his daughter, Jennie Lath
rop, on the arm of Leland Dathrop Jr.
Miss Berner and Miss Hunt, escorted
by Robert Berner, followed, while after
them came the servants of the Stan
ford family. Among these were Ah
Wing and Ah Young from the Nob Hill
residence.
In the procession forming on the
oval many Stanford Club members
from various cities of the United States
were represented. New York was rep
resented by Dr. H. B. Reynolds; Cam
bridge, Mass., by J. K. Bonnell; Wash
ington, D. C, by H. R. Johnson and

chitect C. E. Hedges. D. McGilvray.
The great procession marched slowly
the distance from the chapel to the
mausoleum, where the crowds by this
time numbered 5000. The circle before
the chapel was kept clear, and here
the students and organizations ranged
themselves while the choir was placed
at the right of the tomb. The casket
was placed directly before the tomb
on trestles, and the relatives and
friends occupied chairs facing it on
the left. As it was carried to its place
the choir sang softly, "Lead, Kindly
Light."
While the wind sighed through the
branches of the oaks mat shelter the
mausoleum, the Rev. Charles R. Brown
pronounced the final oration, and his
closing words were deely significant of
the spirit of the occasion. He said:
We have reached the place where we are
to render this last sad office to all that re
mains on earth of this honored and generaous
family. The dust returns to dust as It was,
but the memory of what they have been and
have done will abide here forever, and the
helpful Influence of the service they have ren
dered will rest unceasingly upon our State
and ouV nation and upon the young manhood
and womanhood of lands across the pea.
The hich office of sorrow has been abun
dantly d/clared in literature, in art and life.
The sweet singer of Israel, looking bacfc upon
the supreme bereavement of hla life, said to
Â«Â» â¢ .d. â¢ Tiiuu hast MManreO me when I was in
distress" â the suffering had served to widen
the range of hi* sympathies and to extend his
purpose of usefulness. One of the most widely
read poems in the English language sprang
from Tennyson's sorrow over the death of his
friend Hallam.
The loveliest building which adorns the
earth, the Taj Mahal, grew out of the sorrow
of a generous man over the death of his de
voted wife. The strains of that "Funeral
March and Seraphic Chant" by Guliinant,
which alone Is able to contend for pre-emi
nence in that field with the celebrated com
position of Chopin, was written within three
days after Â£he death of the composer's mother
Somehow the eyes that have been washed with
teara come to have a clearer vision of the
benuty of holiness and of service and of God
We think of all this as we gather here
around thU mausoleum and under thÂ« shadow
of these noble university bulldlnpv It waa
far away in sunny Italy that the light died
out of thÂ« sky for theÂ»e devoted parents. P<Â«
sessed of ample mean* and with the highest
aspirations for the development and usefulness
of /.heir only ion, it seemed, when he died
that the very purpose of existence for them
was utterly gone
PLAN UNIVERSITY.
But in the very hour of thla overwhelming
sadness Senator Stanford rose up and said
"The children of California shall be my chll
dren," and the plans for this splendid in
stitution began to take shape in his mind.
Aod from the very place where mother-love
seemed to go down in defeat before the
stroke of death this noble woman came forth
with a tender, gracious interest in all the
boys and girls who In years to came would
gather here upon her own estate and â within
these goodly buildings to receive training and
equipment for that life of useful service
which the would have chosen for her own son.
The old word of the Psalmist was again made
flesh, for Ood enlarged them when they were
in distress until their gentrous purpose In
cluded a multitude of sons and daughters
which no man as yet can number.
It is not for me to utter here those words
of personal eulogy which are upon all our
lipe. Look up and out upon these stately
buildings! Look Into the faces of the serious
and cultured men who compose the faculty!
Look upon the faces of promise which belong
to the alumni and the student body! Let
your vision stretch on into the future and
Include the lrwumerabto company yet to be
blessed by the benefactions of this university
and you will read the eulogy which needs no
word of m!nc!
When David Livingston died in Africa, far
inland, the faithful natives â¢whom he had led
into Christian life took his body up>n their
shoulders and bore It all the way. two hundred
miles, to the seacoast, where it was p)aced
on board the British ship to be carried to
Its last resting place in Westminster Abbey.
And if all those who have been blessed and
who are yet to be blessed by the generous
kindness of Mrs. Stanford could have gathered
there would have been enough of them to
have stretched hands all the way across the
wide sea to sunny Hawaii and to have offered
her body the conveyance of loving: apprecia
tion to its resting place beside the univer
sity to which she has given herself without
measure. Yet after nil the body Is but the
outworn and discarded tenement from which
the life has moved into ampler quarters and
our highest service is best rendered to the
souls of those we love. If all this* to whom
she has been and will be a friend could come
they would take her spirit I* thÂ» arms of
their gratitude and bear It to the plane wher*
H may become a pillar fn the temple of our
God to m no more out.
The Rt. Rev. William F. Nichols,
Bishop of California, then, in low tones,
pronounced the Episcopal burial serv
ice, after which the choir softly sang,
"Nearer, My God, to Thee," while
many in the vast concourse within
reach of the music joined in the re
frain; others wept. At the conclusion
of the words committing the mortal
remains of Mrs. Stanford to the grave
the eight pallbearers lifted the casket
into the steel chest, the doc-rs were
closed and the choir spontaneously
burst forth with the beloved "Alma
Mater" of Stanford.
To-day the iron gates will be opened,
the steel chest will be lowered into the
marble sarcophagus that is placed be
tween the stone resting places of her
husband and son, the marble lid will
be replaced and sealed, and the visitors
to the tomb will behold through the
Iron-barred doors the simple inscrip
tion under a carved cross. "Jane
Lathrop Stanford. Born In Mortality,
August 25, 1828. Passed to Immortal
ity, February 28, 1905."
AGKD MAN ASPHYXIATED.â M. B. Mer

was quickly overcome by the deadly fumes.
His body was removed to the Morgue.
RESIGNATION IS
DOMINANT NOTE OF
FUNERAL SERVICE
Dramatic Moments in Sanctuary
No Hollow Sham of Grief Is Manifested, but a
Deep and Sincere Sorrow and Respect.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
There is no Death! What teccu so Is transi
tion;
This life of mortal breath
Is but a suburb of the lite elyslan
Whose portal we call death.
It was with this spirit of resignation
â the highest, noblest conception of the
Christian soul â that Jane Lathrop
Stanford was laid to rest by the side of
her loved ones gone before.
Glad broke the day over the valley
where the dead awaited sepulcher.
The dripping clouds that had hung
heavy over the house of mourning, at
midnight broke asunder, making way
for the golden sun in the eastâ a resur
rection of joy after shadow.
And this was the tenor of the com
mittal service of yesterday, perhaps the
most impressive funeral ceremony seen
in California since the burial of Thomas
Starr Kingâ and not unlike the com
mittal of the well beloved divine, with
out material display and without bom
bast. What demonstration there was
came from the hearts of people.
By 12 o'clock the campus, green with
the freshness of early spring, was alive
with people resident and from abroad,
bent upon paying a last tribute to the
foremost woman in Californiaâ she
whose name was to-day upon every
tongue, and voiced in tenderest tone
even by the thoughtless.
By 1 o'clock crowds had massed at
the entrances to the chapÂ«l, where the
final services were to be held. But by
a sympathetic understanding between
the officers in charge and the arriving
hosts, not a murmur of dissent nor a
sound of confusion was heard above
the hum of lowered voices.
Within the sanctuary reared by
command of the dead was a scene not
soon forgotâ for such as see and feel.
The sun was pouring In through the
splendid windows over the marble
altar, throwing a living light into the
prophetic story they strove to tell â the
Prince of Peace, with his promise; the
crucifixion, with its sorrow; the resur
rection, with its triumphs. And it was
a dramatic thing when at the height
of the service the lowering sun threw
its rays full upon the "Triumph over
Death" â a comforting thing, a solace
to the sorrowing.
Soon the great church filled â and in
that gathering of 2000 men and women
there was not a face of frivolty â not
one that might have strayed In or hap
pened in. They came and they came
with a purpose, these/ men and women
of activities. As to the presence of
bitter sorrow, such as one can feel only
at a close personal loss, there was no
sham evidence â hot tears and silent
biting grief were the portion of the rel
atives and the close friends and serv
ants.
But the students who tasted daily of
her bounty, but who knew her only
Impersonally, mourned silently, re
spectfully. And this was the attitude
of the people â the plain people, so well
beloved by the dead woman. They
mourned silently and respectfully.
The psychological moment appeared
when the eight stalwart university men
bore the coffin up the aisle to the altar,
the great organ sobbing its sorrow.
A beautiful pall of violets and lilies
of-the-valley fell over the bier, which
rested where the ruby light from the
chancel windows fell upon It. On
each side stood the floral tributea, a
few wreaths, tulle- veiled; a column of
leaves, wreath-bound, and a great
white cross from the devoted niece of
Mrs. Stanford, bearing the mute salu
tation. "Auntie." Upon the altar stood
two simple bunches of Bermuda lilies
âsweet tokens of Christian character
and tenderness.
Through all the service of word and
song there was a oneness of thought.
It could be felt as a tangible thin*-
that the soul waa a thins that lived.
and that rest came after death. And
this waa the; basis of that calm res
ignation that was the dominant note of
the service.
The service over, the people filed out
of the chapel to leave the dear ones
alone with their dead.
Anon they came, with the students â
1100 of themâ walking ahead, the Kir is
in white frocks, with a touch of black.
their hair glinting in the sunlight: the
lads with heads bared to the breeze:
' the lads and lassies that know so well
; the fullness of the bounty oÂ£ the hon
! ored dead. Then came the faculty, the
| alumni, and the rest of the invited,
I guests, and lastly the devoted servants.
I to whom Mrs. Stanford had long been
j friend and counselor.
Here was the character of the woman
l laid bare. Here is where her true self
: was revealed to the world, when those
| who served her daily, under the stress
of illness, disappointment and Krief.
| wept and wrung the hands in Krief at
| her passing.
Another touching note at the ser
| vice, the prestige given the delegation
: of messenger boys from the A. D. T.
' r., four manly little chaps a-srlitter
| with brass buttons and brave in crisp
i uniforms, who hud come to attest to
! their love for the benefactress whom
they knew but in name.
Beyond cavil, the most beautiful
floral tributes ever garnered together
in this land of flowers were gathered
about the mausoleum, tributes coming
from every corner of America wherÂ»
the Cardinal is known and honored.
Here was In truth a sight:â men of
affairs, women of brain (not many of
fashion, by the way), students of pur
pose, thousands of them standing rev
erent beneath a turquoise sky to list tÂ»
the last wordâ the commitment to the
sepuicher of a woman whose steadfast
devotion to self-conceived duty will em
blazon her name upon the annals of
history.
And in all that thoughtful day. there
was no time so fraught with feeling as
when th* white-robed choir lifted Its
voice to heaven In "Nearer. My God,
to Thee."
Every head was bowed, save the
; sweet voiced singers, who sang
straightway to blue skiesâ and into
every heart that beat.
The breath of crushed periwinkle 1 ,
the sweet harbingers of spring, gave
warning too late that the masses of
mourners had trod upon the well-be
loved beds of vines, but the hurt was
sustained in love â a motive that wipes
out injury.
And thus was Jane Lathrop Stanford
gathered to her fathers. Thus was her
poor, tired body laid to rest by the side
! of her loved ones gone before â she who
so often, quoted, in the sorrow of her
widowed and childless days: "It la by
suffering that Ood has most nearly ap
proached Man; it is by suffering that
Man draws most nearly to God."

RETREATING RUSSIAN ARMY

Slavs Are Now Resting Thirty-Four
Miles South of Gunshu Pass
Prospects of Peace Are Thought to

>T. PETERSBURG, March 28. 8:40 a.
m â The Russian rear guard is now oc
cupying a line of fairly strong natural
positions thirty-four miif'S south of
(iunshu Past, the center being the rail
road Sipir.ghai and the flanks
covering the roads on either side, which
apparently it ie the intention to defend
long enough to force the Japanese to
show their hand. The Russians may,
however, have been outflanked, and
hÂ«*\<^ no intention of making a serious

turning operations on both flanks, in
â¢ng a probable basis in fact. The
tpondtnts believe a resumption of

PARIS. March L' 4â Prospects of
peace between Russia and Japan aÂ»
i-umed a more definite and almost a
tangible aspect Ui-day as the result of
th<- announcement of the resumption
cf negotiations for a Russian loan.
The effect of the first announcement
was to stimulate the market, and par
ticularly Russian s*ecuritieF.
Coupled with the announcement of
the resumption of loan negotiations
came a strong intimation from official
and diplomatic quarters that step's
looking toward peace had been defin
itely taken by Russia. The Foreign
Office declined to confirm a report that
France was likely to be the interme
diary; but diplomats who are actively
interested for the first time gave
credit to the statement that Russia
had decided to seek peace.
It was "said in these quarters that
Russia would deal directly with Tokio
through the French Minister, who has
charge of Russia's interests in Japan.
Russia's chief preoccupation is cud
to be avoidance of having peace plans
arouse the animosity of the powerful
war element at home, i

LONDON. March 25.â The possibility
of arranging peace between Russia and
Japan and the financial contest be
tween the two countries are attracting
greater attention for the moment than
the strategic departments in Manchu
ria. Comparisons are drawn between
the respective status of the two na
tions in the money market now and at
the beginning of the war.
The spectacle of the Russian Minister
of Finance inviting newspaper editors
and correspondents to verify by per
sonal inspection the national bullion
deposits, while Japan is negotiating an
enormous loan on better terms than
her previous small, timid issues, puts
the development of the credit of the
two belligerents into vivid contrast,
and is gTeatly commented on.
The London papers express little
doubt that Russia will obtain her loan
in France eventually, but on hard
terms. It is reported that the new
Japanese loan is already fully under
written, and that dealings have begun
at a pubstantial premium.

Believed That People Will

ST. PETERSBURG, March 24.âIn
terior Minister Boullgan to-day re
ceived a delegation from the municipal
ity of Moscow which urged that dele
gates of the municipality Bhould be
admitted to the representative confer
ence, announced in the imperial re
script of March 3. that free discussions
affecting the work of the conference be
permitted in the press and that the
deliberations of the conference be held
in public. The interview lasted an
hour.
Bouligan will receive a deputation
ffom the Moscow Zemstvo to-morrow.
The Liberals apparently have won a
partial victory in the composition of
the Bouligan committee to elaborate
the scheme for national representation
In the imperial rescript. Planting them
selves squarely on the demand for a
chamber or parliament elected by uni
versal suffrage with control of the bud
get administration, they insisted that
a committee of bureaucrats could not
be trusted to express the public will,
and backed by the press they kept up
their agitation for the participation of
elected representatives. Powerful sup
port was also furnished Dy the Zems
tvos and the professional and educa
tional bodies throughout Russia, which
flooded Minister Bouligan and the Com
mittee of Ministers with resolutions of
the same tenor and purport.
The Liberals, if they could secure
control of the committee, would vote
a proposition for the election of an
assembly which would pronounce for a
constitution. The Government, how
ever, to prevent such a contingency,
only yielded the admission into the
commission of "selected" not "elected"
representatives.
The Government's programme un
doubtedly is to restrict the body crea
ted under the rescript to a chamber
composed of representatives of the
classes sitting in conjunction with the
Council of the Empire, but having only
a consulting voice in legislation, thus
preserving fntact the principle of au
tocracy.

Bj>ect*l Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, March 24.â An interna
tional episode that has caused perplex
ity to the American and Russian gov
ernments, and which has furnished a j
great deal of gossip for the press of i
the land, has just come to a happy end
ing in this city.
Several weeks ago it was announced
that Lieutenant Peter Michaeloff, Lieu
tenant Andrew Kyra Dynjan and First
Engineer Serge Kapatzin of the Rus
sian cruiser Lena, which has been lying |
at the Mare Island Navy Yard for aev- j
eral months, had violated their parole j
and returned to St. Petersburg. After
negotiations between the two govern
ments it was stated in a St. Petersburg
dispatch that the three young officers
had been degraded and ordered to re
port to Captain A. Berlinsky at Mare
Island.
Nothing more was heard of the mat
ter until last night, when the three
officers, accompanied by the wives and j
children of Dr. Vladmir Zadbotkin and j
Chief Engineer Serge Rotmanoff and \
the blushing bride of Lieutenant I
Mlchaelcrff stepped off the San Francis
co boat and into a launch which con
veyed the party to the Lena.
It now appears that Lieutenant
Michaeloff had been engaged before
the breaking out of war to the daugh
ter of a prominent solicitor in the Rus
sian capital. When the call of duty
came the young lieutenant went away
with the promise to his sweetheart
that he would return and wed her ere ;
the year was out. He was assigned !
to the Lena and was with the Vladivo- !
stok squadron during the early days of â¢
the present struggle. After the Lena |
came to Mare Island, and the day for ;
the claiming of his bride approached
and there were no signs of the war's j
ending or of his being able to return I
and claim his sweetheart, Michaeloff j
became anxious. Finally he took his 1
two friends, Lieutenant Kyra Dynjan |
and Engineer Kapatzin, into his conn- !
dence. To his surprise, he found that j
their hearts were also given to maids
In the gay Russian capital. As they
talked of their sweethearts the desire
to return became too strong to be re- !
sisted, and so the three young officers, j
leaving their uniforms and personal ef- !
fects behind, stole away from San '
Francisco and were speeding homeward '
before their absence was discovered.
Michaeloff' s sweetheart was awaiting
him when he arrived in St. Petersburg, ;
and the marriage was celebrated forth
with. The other two men who had '
broken their parole were taken prison- ]
ers by the Government before their i
marriages could be solemnized. It is j
said that their promised wives were i
anxio-us to marry them, even in the :
face of the impending disgrace, but the 1
fathers of the young ladies, who were 1
serving in the palace of the Czar, 1
would not allow the unions to take 'â .
place until the too ardent young lovers
had satisfied the demands of the Rus
sian Government. When the cases j
were explained ta the Minister of War,
he ordered all the young men back to
America, but imposed no other penalty.
Judge J. A. Browne, whose linguistic
ability "has won him a place in the ;
heart of every man on the Lena from
powder monkey to captain, took charge
of the party after its return from the
Lena. He had been advised of the
ceming of the Russians and had rent- j
ed cottages for the bride and groom j
and the others.
HOW TO LIVE
FOR A CENTURY
Special Dispatch to Tht Call.
CHICAGO, March 24.â For sudden
strong effort or severe trial, eat meat;
for long continued effort, for endurance,
eat cereals; after exhausting mental
labor, eat yolk of eggs; after exhausted
physical labor, drink infused tea; for
pure brain stimulant, drink coffee; for
palenees, eat lean meat and spinach; to
make gray brain matter, eat eggs,
beans and oats; for sound sleep eat
onions and garlic.
By following the above precepts laid
down to the National Promotion of
Health Club by Dr. J. B. S. King here
to-day, you will live to be 100 years
old. At any rate the doctor says so.
"The first thirty-three years of man's
life is fcr growth," he declared, "the
breast bone; which at the thirty-third
year Is composed of three bones, then
consolidates into one, ending the grow
ing period. The next thirty-three years
is for work. The remaining period is
for the enjoyment of the fruits of labor.
"Many people who get stout at their
fortieth year think they are in fine
shape. It is a mistaken idea. Stout
ness at 40 is a sign of old age as much
as gray hair. When it is noticed, the
diet should be cut down one-third. The
ideal old age is to be lean, spare and
active. Old age, however, loves fat,
while youth detests it.
"Oats for children and Indian corn
for adults is almost perfect food. Meat
is only food for severe effort. Too much
meat, however, causes bad temper. The
nearest approach to a perfect brain
stimulant is coffee."

Azpiroz After a Long
Illness Passes
Away.
He Conducted Case
Against Emperor
Maximilian.
WASHINGTON. March 24.â Senor
Don Manuel de Azpiroz. Mexico's first
Embassador to the United States, died
this afternoon at the Mexican em
bassy, surrounded by members of hiÂ»
family. He was 69 years of age.
though a sick man since last fall, the
Embaasador's death was due to a re
lapse caused by exposure on inaugura
tion day. Against the advloe of his
physicians, Senor Aapiro* left his sick
room and attended the inaugural cere
monies at the Capitol, where he came
near fainting.
For years the Embassador has suf
fered from gastritis and this weakened
his heart. His death this afternoon
was unaccompanied by suffering.
Senor de Azpiroz left his law office
to enter the Mexican army and ren
dered gallant service in the uprising
of his country against the French in
tervention, rising In rank from sec
ond lieutenant to colonel. After the
fall of Queretaro, he was appointed
prosecuting attorney in the court
martial of Maximilian, Mlramon and
Mejai.
When the revolution of Tuxtepec un
der General Diaz overthrew the exist
ing Government Colonel Aspiros retired
to private life. In May, 1890, he be
came Assistant Secretary of the Min
istry of Foreign Relations and held
that position until his appointment of
First Mexican Embassador to the
United States.
The Imperial house of Austria has al
ways taken the position that Senor Az
piroz, through his connection with the
court-martial of Maximilian, was in
part responsible for Maximilian's exe
cution and during the early days of the
service of Senor Azpiroz at Washing
ton this fact proved of keen embarrass
ment to himself and the Austrian rep
resentative. Finally it was arranged
that when brought together at official
functions these two diplomats should
exchange formal greetings. This, how
ever, was not until an embarrassing in
cident had occurred at the White House
during the administration of President
McX inley. when the Mexican Embassa
dor was assigned to escort to the din
ing-room the wife of the Austrian Em
bassador and the latter felt compelled
to decline.

of Assistant Secretary of State F. B.

Several months ago the Union Iron

bids to the Russian Government for

iron works to do the work, but the
Navy Department refused to allow the
ship and crew to go to San Francisco
while the war was in progress, as the
guarding of 500 men who compose
the ships crew would be. an expen
sive and hazardous undertaking. The
matter rested for some time and then
the Russian representatives and the
Navy Department agreed that the
work should be done at the navy yard
by Uncle Sam's mechanics.
The Union Iron Works, however,
which is a branch of the ship-building
trust, did not propose to lose a good
piece of business without a struggle,

was used to secure another ruling from
the Stitp Department. Loomis' visit

A. Thomas, a real estate dealer, was
at work on his bonks in his oifice in
the Frost building to-nlpht two mask
ed men entered the place. When
Thomas looked up he found himself
covered by four revolvers â two in th<;
hands of each of the robbers. He was
commanded to stand in a corner with
his face to the wall, and was held there
by one of the men while the other pro
ceeded to search thÂ» cash drawer.
E. D. Lent, a Southern Pacific ma
chinist, entered the office for the pur

he is buying on the installment plan
while the thieves were there. The rob

Lent to throw up his hands, and be
cause he was not quick enough struck
him across the head with his revolver,
cutting his ear almost from his head:
Lent then put up a fight, and the rob
ber continued- to beat him with the re
volver, finally knock! ng%him down and
out. The robber searched Lent and se
cured the ?40.

KILLS HIS WIFE
AND HIMSELF
Los Angeles Attorney and
Spouse Found Dead in
Home in Harvard Boulevard
NO MOTIVE FOR CRIME
Police Believe That Lawyer,
After Retiring, Suddenly
Became Bereft of Reason
LOS ANGELES, March 24.â Charles
Stephen Rogers, a patent attorney, and
his wife were found dead in bed in their
home at 1807 Harvard boulevard tlfla
afternoon. The circumstances indica^p
that Rogers shot his wife and theft
committed suicide.
Rogers and his wife retired to their
rooms at 9 o'clock last evening. This
morning when Henry Rogers, their son,
ten years old, came downstairs for his
breakfast, neither his father nor step
mother appeared, and he finally ate the
meal alone, leaving soon afterward for
school.
At noon, when he returned home,
the servant told him that the door to
his parents' room had not yet been
opened, and that she had heard noth
ing from the inside. The boy tried
the door, found it locked, and as he
could get no response from within, re
ported the matter at once to the police.
A squad of officers was sent to the
scene immediately.
Wran the polic-e arrived aÂ£ the house
they broke open the bedroom door.
Rogers, and his wife were found lying
dead on the bed, partially covered with
blood-stained bed clothing. The woman
had been shot in the left side, while
an ugly wound in Rogers' head showed
where the bullet had taken effect. Be
tween the bodies lay the revolver with
which the crime had been committed.
The officers concluded that Rogers first
shot his wife and then killed himself.
Rogers was between forty and forty
five Tears of age. He was a patent at
torney, and, it is said, enjoyed a lucra
tive practice. He came to Los Angeles
last September. When last seen he
was in the best of spirits. No motive
for the crime ie kiiown. One theory
is, that after retiring last night Rogers
became suddenly insane.

effected. His steady attendance soon
attracted the attention of the attaches,
and they tolerated It until his inter
minable smile began to grate on their
nerves. Clerk "Barney" Conlan was
first to complain. Every time he lifted
his gaze from his desk it encountered
Luigi's mirth-expressing countenance,
and finally the clerk became so fasci
nated that he found himself uncon
sciously staring at Luigi when he
ought to have been attending to offi
cial duty. Sd in self-defense he com
passed the driving forth of the little
Italian, who immediately betook him
self to Judge Fritz's court, and there
ventilated his harassing grin until
yesterday morning, when he was sum
moned to the bench and asked for an
explanation.
' What ilo you mean by It?" his Hon
or inquired.
"By vat 7" said Luigi, his facial ori

"Yet wjien you were "pinched 1 you

"Ah licka da wife an' getta da thirt'

"Well," said the Judge, "I can't pun
ish you for smiling â indeed I consider
a smile preferable to a frown on any
face â but this court cannot afford to
have its nerves shattered every time
it raises its eyes, and unless you trans

"Da wife washa da clo'."
"And you are content to live in idle

"Ah gotta only da one mitt," and he
held un the stump of a right arm to
prove that he was incapacitated for
manual labor.
"Oh, if you were not a loafer by
choice you would peddle or do some
thing else that you are able to do.
Get out now and don't bring your

"Peddle, heyâ dat da gooda joke,"

man life. The patrolman who was hur
ried out in response to the first call
found a group of sympathetic house
wives surrounding a prostrated and
bedraggled form and chafing over po
lice tardiness, and when he leaped from
the patrol wagon and turned the rain
soaked bundle upon Its back it looked
up at him and said:
"An' are ye Â»V slob they sent for
me?" followed by some personal re
marks that turned the sympathy of
the matrons to horror and drove them
shuddering out of earshot and the rain.
It was Mary Ann Hamilton, habitual

Constantine Sjornstron, Robert
Rasmussen and Tullah Ulsted, men of
the sea, consumed oyster cocktails in
the restaurant of Fred Hammer, 114 ft
Sixth street, and then refused to pay
more than 10 cents apiece for the
same, although the scheduled price
was 15 cents. The restaurateiy plead
ed until his face was severely struck
by a fist of one of the mariners and
then he blew several shrill blasts on a
whistle, which brought Patrolman J.
Rooney to the spot. Instead of being
awed by the uniform representing the
law's majesty, the trio scoffed at it,
and one of them went so far in ex
pression of his contempt as to "bon
net" the officer, said act consisting of
swinging a fist with such force upon
the roof of the stiff felt helmet as to
drive it downward and crush it upon
its wearer's ears. All of which re
sulted in arrest and booking for bat
tery and defrauding an innkeeper. In
cidentally it may be stated that the
defendants did not escape scot free
of physical Injury after the "bonnet
ing."
As one man the three sailors re
quested Judge Mogan to permit them
to go aboard a good ship that lay in
the offing awaiting their arrival ere
she could shake out her rags and
start for northern waters. His Honor,
however, informed them that their of
fense was too serious to permit him
to grant their request and suggested
that they employ a lawyer to plead
lior them, which they were not qual
ified by either education or experi
ence to do for themselves. But the
suggestion was unanimously spurned,
Mr. Rasmussen averring that he felt
safer without than he would be with
a legal representative, and Mr. Sjorn-
Stron preferring to take chances with
the case as it then stood to having it
altered in any way by the enlistment
of a lawyer. So there was nothing
else for the Judge to do than to pro
nounce the charges proven and re
mand the defendants for sentence to
day.

The action brought by the E. I. Dv
Pont de Nemours Powder Company
against the Peyton Chemical Com
pany, in which the first named cor
poration holds stock, for the right to
examine its books and for $30,000
damages for withholding: the privilege,
was on hearing before Judge Seawell
yesterday. The Peyton Chemical
Company sought to show that the Dv
Pont Company was doing business in
this State and had not complied with
the law and hence could not maintain
the action, but Judge Seawell held that
the mere establishment of the fact that
the- DuPont Company held stock in the
Peyton Company and other powder
companies did not constitute proof
that it was engaged in business here.
An exception was entered to the rul

Before Any Force Was Used
Spaclal Dinpatch to ThÂ« Can.
NAPA, March 24.â The trial of At
tendants T. D. Shanahan and Oscar
Retzman of the Napa State Hospital
on the charge of killing Patient Joseph
Louis at the asylum was continued
this morning in the Superior Court.
Dr. L. A. Frary. who conducted two
autopsies on the body of Lcuis. testi
fied that he found that the neck of
the lunatic had been badly dislocated;
that there were several severe bruises
on his head and chest; that ten ribs
were broken on Louis' right side and
eight on his left side, evidently by a
heavy blow or the application of force,
and that there were other injuries.
District Attorney Benjamin made
an extended argument fn support of
his request for permission to put on
the stand thret patients of the hos
pital who were witnesses of the strug
gle. Judge Gesford denied the request.
The prosecution then rested.
The first witness for the defense was
Oscar Retzman, one of thÂ» defendants.
He gave a detailed account of the
?vents connected with the tragedy. He
said hi went into room 4 of ward B
on December 25 about 4:30 p. m. and
fed Louis, who was then restrained In
a lock chair. He said he took Louis
out f >f the chair and put him in bed.
"While I was locking the chair
again," said Retzman, "Louis butted
me severely in the chest. I shoved him
avvay several times. He was a much
stronger man, and kept coming at me,
finally kicking me savagely in the ab
domen. I was badly injured, and call
ed to Shanahan for assistance. He re
sponded, and we finally got Louis up
against the wall of the room. While
we had him there I pulled his leg out
from under him. Shanahan and Louis
both fell, with Shanahan on top. The
patient's neck was dislocated In the
fall and Shanahan's knees crushed in
his ribs."
The court adjourned till 9 o'clock to
morrow morning.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
KINIRY MUST SPEND HIS
LIFE IN PRISON.
Four Jurors Refuse
to Give Extreme
Penalty.
After Long Wrangle
Verdict Finally
Reached.
OAKLAND, March 24.â Life impris
onment was the verdict brought in
this afternoon by the jury In the
Kiniry murder trial after twenty
four hours' deliberation. The long
discussion was the result of the refusal
of four of the jurors to hang the man
they believed was guilty of the crime
t 5 . charged. The all-night session was
a very strenuous one, and at times the
arguments among them resulted al
most in a resort to blows.
. While an agreement was made
among the Juror? that nothing should
be said as to how they stood or the
. points upon which they disagreed, two
â¢xvere so incensed at the compromisa
th.-y were forced to make in order to
bring in a verdict that they consented
to talk, and said that Carl Kreillng,
Alfred R. Hay, C. A. McClain and A.
F. Partridge were responsible for the
verdict of life imprisonment. These two
jurors said that they, all agreed that
Kiniry was guilty and that he fired
the fatal shot. Hay told the other
jurors that he once voted to hang a
man. and that he could see him about
him in the jury-room, and that he
would not han>? another, even If he had
to. let Kiniry go.
Kiriiry" "seemingly was unaffected at
the verdict. He. aimlessly looked at
the end of his fingers as Judge Greene
xead the verdict before its announce
ment, and wh^n Clerk McNulty read
the verdict aloud Kiniry gave no indi
cation of his feelings, although he es*
caped hanging by a narrow, margin,
ills, day -of sentence was set for Frl
* day week, and he was taken back to
the jail.
There were others besides the jurors
who were disappointed at the verdict.
District Attorney Allen, Deputy Har
ris and Police Judge Mortimer Smith,
brother of . the policeman for whose
niurder ; \:niry was tried, were openly
chagrined at the compromise verdict.
Harris said: ""It was as clear a case
as ever went to a jury, and these men
Â« ho arc responsible for it upon their
oaths during their examination said
that they had no feeling against the
. dtath penalty." " '
It was shortly after 3 o'clock yester
\ 6ny afternoon when the Jury retired
for ration, and they were ushered
back twenty- four hours later. The
/jrors who tried the case were: George
W. Shreve, li. F. Phillips. Otto Nie
haus, Carl Kreiling, Alfred H. -Hay,
Farley B. Granger, J. A. /Marshall,
Justus Overacker. C. A. McClain, â¢ John
.M. Creed and. W. W. Walker. They
took seventeen ballots, but never once
did more than eight vote for.ihe death
penalty. The question was openly put
in the four as to which they would do
if there wÂ«Â»rÂ«Â» but two verdicts possible, i
- -either to acquit or hang the defend
ant. They said they would make him
a free ynan first.
* Kiniry, while not yet 23 years of age,
iÂ« looked upon as one of the worst
criminals, in- the country. Klnlry's ca
reer shows that lie would Ptop at noth
ing, and it was not his fault that he
t did not kill Policeman Henderson of
Los Angeles, upon whom he opened
fire at short range at the time of his

SAY PANAMA ROAD SHOULD
BE FOR FREE COMPETITION
Calif ornian Canneries Company Ad-
dress Important Communication
to Commissioner Bristow.
The officials of the California Can
neries Company have addressed a com
munication to United States Commis
sioner Bristow of the Panama Canal
Commission stating their views on the
railroad across the isthmus. The can
nery men contend that the railroad
should be for free competition and that
the Government might dispose of the
steamship lines on the Atlantic coast,
leaving the lines there as well as on
the Pacific coast free to be operated
by private enterprise. The communi
cation in part reads as follows:
"There is no need to say more on
thLÂ«Â» subject, because we feel satisfied
that your investigation will demon
strate the situation, and we will there
fore conclude by merely mentioning
that to-day California produces in
many lines of agriculture sufficient for
50.000,000 of people, with less than
2,000,000 consumers. Between this
State and the center of population of
this country, as you are aware, there is
whai might be termed a vast desert,
which must be crossed by the rail
roads to reach the consumers. We
have at our door the vast Pacific: we
have one of the finest seaports in the
world, and yet instead of having twenty
or thirty steamship lines centering
here and going out and bringing in
products and making this a great dis
tributing point, we flnd only a few
steamship companies, and these con
trolled by agreements and contracts in
restraint of trade. When this city and
State reach their proper position as a
distributing center for products and
manufactures, both inward and out
ward, the railroads will find just as
great profit in carrying goods from
Pacific Coast ports as far east as Utah
as they ever had in controlling the sit
uation by combinations and agree
ments."
SUPERVISOR LUXSTEDT
STOUTLY DENIES CHARGES
Says He Never Communicated With
Manager Lawless In Connection
With Gas Rates.
Supervisor Theodore Lunstedt
stoutly denies the charges that he was
in any way connected with the alleged
s< -heme to force the gas company to
j.ay over money for the fixing of
rates. Lunstedt makes the following
statement:
BAN FRANCISCO, March 24, 1005.
Editor of ThÂ« Callâ Sir: As I have
not been interviewed before, owing to tne
death of my brother, and as the lull purport
of the charges against five members of the
Board of Supervisors was not called to my at
tention until this morning, I trust you will do
me the Justice of giving space to my brief
but pronounced denial. 1 never spoke to Mr.
Lawless in my life except in open meetings of
the Board of Supervisors and then only by
asking questions pertaining to the gas Inquiry
then going on. nor did I ever visit Mr. Law
less or any other official of the gas company,
ii has never been my policy as a public offi
cial either to favor or to cinch corporations
with whom the board and its members were
thrown in contact. When I cast my vote for
the Â»0-cent gas rate. l did so feeling that I
was doing my duty to the people and justice
to the San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany. It seems^to me to be the rankest kind
of Injustice to altwnpt to besmirch the char
acter of public servants who are conscientious,
ly trying to do right by the whole people.
Politics is generally considered - to be a dirty
game and .In this -case the ; game *eems to

Monday's meeting of the ' board not only re
quest hut demand that these . ridiculous and
cowardly charges be fully Investigated. I in

upon all matters voted upon since I have been

BIBLE STORY
IS EXPLAINED
SpeciaJ IMspatch to The Call.
BALTIMORE, Md.. March 24.â The
biblical story of Eve being formed from
the rib of Adam was explained to-day
by Professor James T. Dennis of Balti
more.
Nowadays men have twelve ribs.
Eight thousand years ago they had
thirteen. Professor Dennis knows this
is so because he has seen old skeletons.
He said a party, of which he was in
charge, discovered 175 mummies in
Egyptian tombs, and that of this
number the thirteen ribbed individu
als were so plentiful as to make this
anatomical peculiarity a distinctive
feature.
"These peculiar skeletons dated back
6000 years B. C," Professor Dennis told
an audience at Johns Hopkins Uni
versity, "so men soon after the crea
tion must have had thirteen ribs'."
COMMERCIAL MUSEUM SENDS
STATEMENT TO BRISTOW
Addresses Federal Commissioner on
Subject of Freight Movements
on tlie Pacific Coast.
The Pacific Commercial Museum
has addressed a letter to J. I* Bristow,
Federal commissioner, relating to
traffic, in part, as follows:
The report of the Canal Commission having
contained many j>otent facts relating to the
commerce of the Pacific Coast and the effect
upon such trade by the opening of the canal
to more direct urn by Eastern shippers, ac
well as by those of England and the continent
of Europe, this Institution undertook to elicit
information from the important trade centers
of Central America, South America and the
west coast of Mexico, besides other Pacific:
Ocean ''ountrles. as to the opinions of the mer
chants in those countries regarding the pos
sibilities of creating and fostering a more
direct trade with the Pacific Coast of thÂ«
United States.
A s a result, we have received from many re
liable sources information indicating that mer
chants of the above mentioned countries aie
both eager and willing to extend their rela
tions with the Pacific Coast, and that while
present condition* of freight transportation via
Panama may be a favorable reason why such
would be possible, yet in many cases It has
been pointed out to us that the opening of
the canal, or the operation of the Panama
Railroad jointly with outside steamship ser
vice, tramps or otherwise, will unquestion
ably lower the transportation rates on Euro
pean coods exported to Pacific Ocean coun
tries, thereby eventually shutting out the sug
gested possibilities of Increased business with
the Pacific CoaÂ«t.
It is known that Â«yen to-day, notwithstand
ing the high cost of transportation by direct
steamer, or via Panama, Europe la our chief
competitor in the markets of Pacific Ocean
countries. It should be apparent that with
still cheaper freight rates and opportunities
for quicker delivery by the use of the canal,
or the Panama Railroad, thÂ« Kuropean trade
in those market* will still further tend to
affect the commercial relations of Pacific Coast
merchants.
It is, therefore, naturally contended that due
consideration should be â¢ directed toward . main
taining conditions serving: to strengthen and
not Jeopardize ' the foreign trade' of Pacific
Coast exporters., r.. \. -i : i- -: â -. :â â .

the Cnroner's criticism that City Chemist Boths
had reported the presence of strychnine in the
stomach of a. dead man labeled as John Doe,
whereas Dr. Morgan reported the presence of
morphine, Bothe yesterday said that "there is
no proof that the stomach washings submitted
to Dr. Morgan came from the ytomach which
â was submitted to him as that of the unknown
man, John Doe, because two stomachs, that
of Johnson and John Doe, were submitted to
him, not in separate receptacles, but in the

SHERIFF FINDS
VARIOUS CLEWS
Strengthens His Chain of
Evidence Attaching to
the ?uggy and Its Driver
NEGKO WOMAN'S STORY
Two Females Said to Have
Met Men and Received
Large Quantity of Gold
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 24.
Several interesting and probably im
portant facts developed in the
Stege hold-up case to-day. A ne
gro woman offered what may be
important evidence relative to the
disposition of the coin that was
stolen; cartridges from the Winchester
that one of the robbers carried were
found and more witnesses were exam
ined regarding the identification of the
buggy which one of the highwaymen
was supposed to have hired from Aber
nethy's stable.
This morning Sheriff Barnet took the
horse and buggy from Abernethy's
stable, 1318 San Pablo avenue, where
the mysterious "G. Russell" hired the
rig. The Sheriff drove out San Pablo
road, where the rig was carefully ex
amined by W. G. Willit, foreman of a
construction gang on the new Rich
mond electric road, who noticed on
Monday the Daly buggy and a second
one driven hard toward Oakland. Wil
lit said: "This horse is the same in
color and size as the one I noticed
Monday."
Adam Frost of West Berkeley saw
the two buggies speeding along Mon
day morning on Hopkins street. The
drivers inquired where Sacramento
street was, and how to get into Oak
land. The pair answered the descrip
tion of the robbers.
John Rose, a boy, to-day found sev
eral Winchester cartridges in the grass
on Sacramento street near University
avenue, a block from where Daly's
buggy was found.
Hester Mingo, a negress, has related
a story of seeing two men and two
women empty a grip of loose gold coin
Monday afternoon at the corner of
Fifth and Franklin streets. The wo
man said she saw a tall man standing
there with the grip when a young
woman approached him. Shortly after
ward a second man, short and stocky,
joined the pair. The ta^l man opened
the grip from which the young woman
took several handfuls of gold coin.
The short man was also given a quan
tity of the coin. A second woman
joined the group after the short man
departed, walking slowly along Frank
lin street toward Sixth.
Leland Clark and Ralph Driggs, boys,
found a canvas telescope bag this
morning in a barn on Center street,
near Shattuck avenue, Berkeley, which
contained men's underwear, an empty
money-box, inscribed "Bank of Butte
County, Chico, Cal."; some books and
papers, containing the addresses, Al
bert Macey, Eldora, la., and Albert
Macey, New Providence, la. A Wells,
Fargo & Co. Express seal was on the
bag. The police think the flnd was
discarded plunder from a theft.
MILK DRIVERS'
DISPUTE ENDS
The Labor Council' held an execu
tive session last night, at which the
disputed question between the milk
wagon drivers and the Co-operative
Milk Company was taken up. Some
time ago the union men demanded
that the company be boycotted aa un
fair because stockholders were put on
the wagons, but this the Labor Coun
cil refused to allow.
After a lengthy discussion the coun
cil decided that the drivers at present
employed by the co-operative com
pany be admitted into membership of
the Milk Wagon Drivers' Union at the
regular rate of $10. This also stirred
up a discussion, as the union has two
admission processes. The sum of |10
is charged for admission to the union,
while a $40 membership entitled those
who join and pasa a medical examina
tion to certain benefits. The council
submitted the following report on the
question:
."That the Milk Wagon Drivers'
Union shall admit to membership the
milk wagon drivers at present em
ployed by the Workingmen's Co-oper
ative Commercial Company at a fee
of $10 each, and that the Workingmen's
Co-operatise Commercial Company
shall sign the agreement of the Milk
Wagon Drivers' Union, and that all
drivers needed in the future shall be
selected from the membership of the
Milk Wagon Drivers' Union."
Michael Casey announced that he
would move to reopen the case at the
next meeting of the Labor Council
on next Friday night.
JUDGE COOK POSTPONES
SENTENCE ON RADCLIFFE
Witnesses 9s to Character of Young
Man Who Killed Andrew RJley
Will Be Heard.
Harry Radcliffe, convicted of mur
der in the second degree by a jury in
Judge Cook's court for shooting and
killing Andrew Riley at Ninth and
Sheridan streets on the morning of
June 26, appeared for sentence yester
day morning. His girl wife was in
court and she was the picture of mis
ery as she sat with her face buried in
a handkerchief.
Attorney Lindsay made a strong
plea for mercy for the defendant. The
Judge asked the District Attorney if
he knew anything about the defend
ant, and he replied that in all fairness
he would say that he knew nothing
against him except that he had been
a wild young man.
Thereupon the Judge asked Attor
ney Lindsay to have the witnesses
present on Monday morning, remark
ing that there was a wide latitude al
lowed him in the degree of punish
ment, ranging from ten years to life
imprisonment. The jury, he said,
had evidently believed the testimony
of the wife, otherwise the verdict
would have been murder in the nrst
degree.

ALL OFFENDERS
TO BE EXPELLED
Scandals at University to Be
followed by Measures
Radically Administered
MOTHER BEGS FOR SON
Thieving Senior to Be Dis
missed â Boisterous Con
duct Not to Be Allowed
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, March 24.
Strict enforcement of rules that are
supposed to govern the conduct of uni
versity students is to be one of the
results following the scandals created
by Tell Leader Bulkeley's expulsion,
and the arrest two days ago of J. A.
Harris, a senior, charged with stealing
from his fellow students. Riotous con
duot hitherto allowed to pass unno
ticed is to be followed by summary dis
cipline summarily administered. Com
plaints against offending students will
be quickly investigated, and if found
to be well founded punishment will
follow at pnee.
Expulsion from the university is to
be the fate of J. A. Harris, the stu
dent who has confessed to a long
series of thefts from his comrades. The
widowed mother of young Harris vis
ited President Wheeler this morning
and with tears pleaded for mercy for
her son. The blow to her is regretted
by the college authorities, but sym
pathy for the mother is not to inter
fere with the punishment deemed just
in the case of the dishonest senior.
He will be expelled as soon as his case
is passed upon by the court.
The university authorities apparently
are determined to show that offenses of
students are not condoned in the slight
est degree by the faculty, and the stu
dent body, as well, agrees for the most
part that strict measures should be
f taken in all cases of rule breaking, so
that the outside world may know of
the university's feeling in the matter.
The students' official paper this morn
ing editorially says: "We don't want
thieves," and then follows a ringing
editorial from the pen of Editor J. P.
Loeb.
WEST BERKELEY MATROX
TRIES TO END HER LIFE
Husband Declines to Permit Despond-
ent Wife to Be Seen by Any
InÂ«j'ilrers.
BERKELET, March 24. â Two at
tempts to commit suicide were made
to-day by Mrs. May Douglas, a young
married woman of West Berkeley,
both of which were frustrated by
friends and members of her family.
No reason is given for the rash ac
tions of the woman, the husband, who
is a mining amalgamator, declining to
permit his wife to see any inquirers or
to give information himself regarding
the case.
Mrs. Douglas tried to throw herself
from the deck of a Key Route ferry
boat this morning on its first trip to
San Francisco, but was restrained by
passengers, who caught her as she
rushed toward the rail.
Soon after 9 o'clock the young
woman made her second attempt at
suicide, this time swallowing the con
tents of a three-ounce bottle of lin
iment in her home. Her mother was
present and promptly got the assist
ance of a physician, who adminis
tered an emetic and saved the de
spondent woman's life.
DIPLOMATS IX) HASTEN
TO THEIR NEW POSTS
President Anxious That White Should
Take Up HMÂ» Duties In
Italy.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 24.â Me-
Cormick, the retiring Embassador to
Russia, has received urgent instruc
tions from Washington to proceed to
Paris at the earliest possible moment*.
WASHINGTON, March 24.â Inquiry
here reveals the fact that the orders
to Embassa.dor McCormick to proceed
immediately to Paris are to be ex
plained, not on the ground of any dip
lomatic emergency at the French capi
tal, but solely because of the President's
desire to have Henry White, former
secretary of the embassy at London
and newly appointed Embassador to
Italy, take up his post at Rome at the
earliest possible moment. The project
ed international agricultural congress,
in which the Italian Government has
succeeded in interesting President
Roosevelt; the attitude of Italy toward
San Domingo; the probabilities of peace
negotiations in the near future, in
volving combined action by the Euro
pean powers, and several other diplo
matic matters of importance, all new
and, therefore, preferably to be dealt
with by the incoming Embassador
rather than one about to be transferred,
are some of the reasons assigned for
Bending White at once to Rome, al
though he had fully expected to enjoy
a vacation in this country.
THINKS DIAMONDS WILL

OTTAWA, Ontario, March 24. â Dr.
Ami of the Geological Survey is of
the opinion that diamond wealth is
hidden in that part of Canada between
the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay.
"All surveying parties and explor
ers," he said, "should be on the look
out for anything that will show traces
of the precious white stone in this ter
ritory."

LONDON, March 24. â There is cOn

British ship Eskasoni. which left
'Portland, Or., October 15 for Limer
ick. The ship has not been reported
since March 10, when she was off
Lizard Head. A premium of 15 guin

IDEA WARMLY RECEIVED
Ambitious Citizens Expert
to Be Able to Show a Pop
ulation of 50,000 in 1910
BpÂ«ctal DiÂ«p*tch to TnÂ« CÂ»IL
SAN JOSE, March 24.â A Greater
San Jose with a population of 50,000
in 1910 is tha aim of the Chamber
of Commerce. The campaign of an
nexation that has been in progress
for the past three months has prac
tically assured that. Most of the meet
ings held in the suburbs have been Â«n
thuslastic ones and what little oppo
sition has arisen is believed to be van
ishing under the work of the Greater
San Jose committee appointed by the
Chamber of Commerce. This commit
tee consists of the entire board of con
trol of the Chamber of Commerce. It
is composed of twenty-five members-,
of which Walter Trlnkler is chairman.
Meetings have been held in College
Park. West San Jose, Willows, Cottage
Grove, and this evening a large meet
ing is being held in East San Jose.
The campaign will close next week.
While San Jose's growth for the
past twenty-five years has been a
steady one, the city limits have re
mained unchanged. Nearly half Its
population lies in the territory im
mediately adjoining the city. The cen-
BUo of 1900 gave San Jose a population
of but 21,600, when in fact it should
have been a city of more than 30.000
population. This has militated against
the city. Many Easterners refrained
from coming here because of the fig
ures of the census bureau. A recent
census taken by the PostofÃce Depart
ment gavt' this city 28,000 population,
and the same census gave the terri
tory which it is proposed to annex a
population of between 10,000 and 11,
000. This makes San Jose a city of
practically 40.000 population. With
the annexation plan carried the Cham^
ber of Commerc* is satisfied that San
Jose in 1910 will have a population of
more than 50.000.
REMARKABLE GROWTH.
The last two years have been re
markable ones for the city. Its growth
has been marvelous. San Jose is Just
entering upon its "skyscraping age."
The buildings planned for the next
two years will practically change the
business center. Work will commence
next month on the new building of the
Garden City Bank at the corner of
First and San Fernando streets. This
structure will be six stories high and
undoubtedly the flneÃt block in the
city. A rumor has it that the First
National Bank has in contemplation a
ten-story building on the corner of
First and Santa Clara streets. Other
big buildings are contemplated and no
less than a dozen business buildings
are to be erected during the coming
year. In the residence section a large
number of houses are being erected.
San Jose is getting more Eastern
tourists this year than ever before.
Many of the newcomers are men of
money who Intend to make their
homes here. The same progress in
building and settlement is reported
from all the outside towns and the or
chard districts.
The proposed boundary lines of the
Greater San Jose will run to the King
road on the east, taking in East San
Jose: to the Gish road on the north,
annexing the settlement beyond the
Hotel Vendome; to Union avenue on
the west, taking in Crandallville and
the Alameda. and on the south to the
Northern road, making the Willows
and Cottage Grove a part of the city.
These lines' may be modified some, but
the greater city will have an area of
nearly twice that of the present one.
The election for annexation will prob
ably be held some time in April. The
outlying territory will vote as a whole,
and at the same time an election will
be held in the city on the question of
receiving them. The present city ad
ministration under Mayor Worswick
has been an excellent one. Street
lights, sewers and police protection are
held out to the suburbanites to bring
them in.
ELECTRIC RAILWAYS.
Every part of the territory it Is pro
posed to annex is connected with the
city proper by electric roads. In the
last year a network of electric roads,
all radiating from this city, has been
planned for the county. The Interur
ban Electric Road, of which O. A. Hale
is president, has franchises for roads
running to Palo Alto and the towns
between that place and this city, and
also for lines covering the eastern part
of the valley, which will enter the city
through East San Jose, going to
Wayne Station, Berryessa, Alum Rock
Park and Evergreen. The Parkinson
Company recently purchased the San
Jose and Santa Clara Electric Railroad,
and it has rights of way and franchises
for a road between Santa Clara, ard
Palo Alto, which will tap all the towns
along the line of the Southern Pacific.
A road to Alvlso to connect with a
steamer line to San Francisco is also
to be built during the coming year.
These and other conditions will surely
make a Greater San Jose with a popu
lation of 50.000 in 1910.

"Despite the seemingly hopeless out
look, peace at last is in sight. I make
this statement deliberately and cate
gorically, not as a mere probable in

his will, that a further continuation of
the -war would be disastrous to Rus

ly, and therefore conditionally is will

The correspondent says Russia is
willing to make substantial territorial
Loncessions, but the essential condi
tion of peace is that Japan shall ask
no war Indemnity.

Water- Logged Coast
er Picked Up by
the Chehalis.
Vessel's Log Tells of
Hard Fight to Save
Craft.
Somewhere between here and Cape
Flattery, with no human hand to guide
her course, the water-logged hull of
the schooner C. A- Klose is drifting
about looking for some sheltered cove
in which to lay her bones or waiting
for a storm to rend asunder her
planks and send her to rest in the
shape of drift wood. On some other
ran of the ocean the men that manned
the schooner and who left her only
after heart-breaking but futile at-
I to pump out the water which
I'oured in through her opening seams
had failed, may be suffering hardships.
1 orhaps facing death in open boats.
The steam schooner Chehalis, which
arrived yesterday at Grays Harbor,
reports that on March 23, off Hecla
Heads, she picked up the schooner C.
A. Klose, abandoned and in a water
logged condition. Men from the Che
halis boarded the derelict and in the
cabin found the Klose's log. From en
tries there it was learned that a hard
â fight had been made to save the
schooner, but that the pumps had
availed nothing against the inrush of
water. When all hands were exhausted
it was decided to abandon the vessel.
The Chehalis made fast a line to the
derelict, but the hawser soon parted
and as it was dark and stormy the at
tempt to eara salvage was given up
and the deserted schooner left to her
fate.
The C A. Klose, Captain Wagner,
left Astoria March 13 for this port.
She is owned here by A. W. Beadle.
She was built in 1902 at Alameda and
is a vessel of 370 tons net register.
Of the fate of the men who aban
doned the schooner nothing is known.
That th<rj- will reach land is probable,
as the s> hooner was within forty miles
cf the shore when they left her. and,
although the weather has been stormy,
no terrific gales have been reported
within the last few days. They left
the schooner prepared to take care of
ihemselves. It is possible they may
have been picked up by some passing
in which event it may be days
before anything is heard of them.
Though anxious in the absence of any
A. W. Beadle thinks Captain
aer and his men are all right and
expects to hear from them at any mo
ment.
Meanwhile the derelict is a serious
c to navigation and shipping
men are again casting eyes at the rev
enue cutters lying idle at Sausalito and
v ondering whether one of them will
not be dispatched to clear the seas
of this dangerous wanderer.
The tug Dauntless left this city last
night at 9 o'clock to make an effort
to save the water-logged craft.
Seventy-Per Center Arrives.
After mere up* and downs than the rein
surance market has seen for many days the
Yt*th i. bark Francois, quoted at 70 per cent
and heavily played at this port to arrive, has
reached her destination. She left here Septem
ber. 9 for Kuneorn. Nothing was heard of her
from the time she left until she was reported
as having passed the Azores. Before word of
thl* : Â« ufcing was reported the Francois was
lone overdue and was quoted for reinsurance
at 65 i>er cent. Under a heavy play the rate
dropped to bO per cent. Then came word of
her having been epeken and the rate dropped
to 5 per cent. No further news was heard of
her and the rate began to climb until I It
r*-ach*d 23 per cent. Two days ago a cable
gram from London told that the reported
* peaking at- in all probability an error and
the rate jumped to 70 per cent. Yesterday
the Francois was reported safe at Liverpool
and the local reinsurance speculators who made
the most of the various phases of the Francois"
strangely fluctuating rate drew down the kind
of dividends that make speculation attractive.
Mere than $230,000 is said to have been made
by the people in this city who backed j their
faith In the French bark's safety with their
. coin.
f still quoted at 10 per cent.

Holm is out twenty-<-.ne days from

TO LIMIT MUSICAL,
OUTPUT IN CHICAGO
Unions Believe That an Overproduc-
tion of Melody Threatens
Windy City.
CHICAGO, March 24. â An over
production of music is believed by the
Chicago Federation of Musicians to be
threatening Chicago. Consequently
the union proposes to relieve the situa
tion by establishing a 'â¢limitation of
output."
President T. F. Kennedy of the
Musicians' Union has prepared a list
of all theaters and concert and dance
halls in the city, together with the
seating capacity and size of each. The
next step will be to establish a mini
mum-sized orchestra or band which
will be allowed to play in the various
places. By this method of restriction,
it is hoped, the musical output of each
man will be checked.

SPRING TRADE
IS LIVENING UP
Railroad Facilities Taxed
to Accommodate Increased
Shipments of Merchandise
BIG DEMAND FOR STEEL
Crop Reports Are Favorable
and the General Business
Outlook Is Much Brighter
NEW YORK, March 24. â Brad
street's to-morrow will say:
While reflecting irregularities the
volume of distributive trade and the
movement of industry hold the in
crease recorded last week. From the
South, in fact, the tenor of advices is
even better. Retail trade at the large
cities is livening up as spring ad
vances. Crop reports, especially from
winter wheat, are good and increas
ingly favorable.
Lumber and hides are firm and ac
tive.
The really remarkable feature In
current industry is the continuance
of the heretofore heavy inquiry for
all kinds of iron and steel, crude and
finished.
Business failures in the United
States for the week ending March 23
number 204, against 186 last week
and 215 last year.
In Canada failures for the week
number 18, as against 22 last week
and 18 in this week a year ago.
Wheat, including flour, exports for
the week ending March 23 are 1,044,
f>os bushels, against 895,842 last week,
1,101,845 this week last year and
2,401.987 in 1903.
From July 1 to date the exports are
46,638,699 bushels, against 114,742,
284 last year, 120,841,515 In 1903 and
189,873,615 in 1902.
NEW YORK, March 24. â R. G.
Dun & Co.'s weekly review of trade
will say:
Spring trade responds to seasonable
weather and shipments of merchan
dise have increased so rapidly that
railway facilities are severely taxed.
Railway earnings for the first two
wrecksw r eeks of March were 7.9 per cent
larger than last year, ar.d foreign
commerce at this port for the week
shows a gain of $2,077,012 in exports
and $175,258 in imports as compared
with l!) 04.
Strength is seen in the hide market,
especially for native steers of midwin
ter salting, and sole leather branded
hides are in limited supply.
Failures this week number 255 in
the United States, against 226 last
year, and 16 in Canada, compared
with 15 a year aero.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE BLAMED
FOR VICIOUS LEGISLATION
Californitin Warns Illinois Legislature
Against Giving the Ballot to
Other Sex.
SPRINGFIELD, 111.. March 24. â
The Illinois House of Representatives
to-day listened with grave interest to
the reading of a letter from "Pro
Bono Publico," who is at present in
Los Angeles, Cal., and who hopefj the
Illinois Legislature will not pass the
equal suffrage bill.
"God made men and women differ
ent," says the writer. "Then let each
remain in their own condition. If the
State of Illinois grants partial or full
political rights to women, it will bit
terly regret it. Look at the bedev
iled condition of Colorado, which can
be traced to women political bosses
and lack of common sense in women
voters. Californians, profiting by the
sad experience of Colorado, Kansas
and Wyoming, and not wanting their
State to be in the same condition and
their business interests to be ruined
by foolish and vicious legislation, turn
down all attempts of professional
'suffragists and their male adherents
to saddle the abomination on the
State."

IN A TRANCE
FIFTEEN DAYS
Singular Case of Mother and
Daughter Which Has End
ed in Death of the Latter
HYPNOTISM . SUGGESTED
Specialist of Opinion That
They Ignorantly Brought
About Each Other's State
NEW YORK, March 24.â One of the
most remarkable cases in the experi
ence of the doctors of the Presbyterian
Hospital in this city ended to-day in
the death of Miss Luella Huestis of
Mount Vernon, who with her mother,
Mrs. James H. Huestis, had been in a
trance for fifteen days prior to her
death. More than two weeks ago both
of the women were found unconsciou*
in the home of Henry W. Heifer, a
lawyer of this city, and were supposed
to have been asphyxiated by gas.
Neither recovered consciousness and
physicians and hypnotists were puzzled
by their unaccountable coma. Miss
Huestis was an attractive young wo
man, need 22 years.
man, aged 22 years.
Lack of nourishment was the prin
cipal cause of her death, as it was
impossible to give her food except in
liquid form and through a tube. Stim
ulants and oxygen were administered
without effect.
A singular fact is that the young
woman's mother, who lay in an ad
joining room, began to show signs of
the approach of death soon after the
death of her daughter. Like her daugh
ter, the mother also is greatly ema
ciated and the physicians at the hos
pital say that her low vitality is due
principally to starvation.
A specialist in hypnotism who in
vestigated the case has made public
his conclusion that the two women had
unconsciously hypnotized each other
and that gas asphyxiation had nothing â .
to do with the case. He explained
that he had himself been hypnotized |
while hypnotizing a patient and had :
only been awakened by arousing of the
subject. The case of the two women ,
has attracted the attention of icien- j
tists all over the country.
URGES ALL. EMPLOYERS
TO FIGHT UNION DEMANDS
Speaker Before National Metal Trades
Association Opposes Idea of
Compulsory Arbitration.
CHICAGO, March 24. â Manufactur
ers and other employers of labor were
advised at to-day's convention of the
National Metal Trades Association
that their best interests lay in oppos
ing all idea of compulsory arbitration.
The principal address along 1 this line
was made by J. Kirby Jr. of Dayton,
Ohio.
"Arbitration has proved a failure
over and over again," Kirby declared.
"If I am held up for my belongings
and I refuse to surrender them why
should I submit the Question to arbi
tration and take any chances of hav
ing to surrender half of what I have;
then at the next hold-up to surrender
half of what I have left, and so on
until everything I ever had Is gone?"
Klrby's address urged on employers
the necessity of fighting without com
promise labor union demands.
CUDAHY'S MANAGER BEFORE
THE CHICAGO GRAND JURY
Michael Murphy Questioned In Re
gard to Methods of the
Beef Trust.
CHICAGO, March 24. â Specific in
formation reparding shipping, mar
keting and prices of cattle was sought
to-day by the special Grand Jury
which is investigating the combination
of packers. Michael Murphy, general
manager of the Cudahy Packing Com
pany at South Omaha, Sioux City and
Kansas City, was before the inquisi
tors and shed some light upon the
subjects under consideration.
"They asked me first about the
packing business in general," Murphy
said. "Then they took up the sub
ject of marketing and asked all the
details of it. They inquired into the
shipping of cattle and beef. Their
questions did not point to an investi
gation relative to railroads. Then
they went into the subject of prices."

EXCLUSION OF JAPANESE.
y X discussing the extension to Japan of the exclusion policy which
we have adopted in the case of China, it is well to avoid making
* mistakes, and to raise no undue expectations. The question of
general immigration promises to become a burning issue, and the
principle upon which the Japanese branch of it may be settled may
well prove to be that which is applied to all immigration.
'The race question aside, we are receiving at the rale of 5000
Â« day foreign immigrants that are no more desirable than the Jap
anese. The law of movement in the human race dictates migration
from countries that are poor and with low wage conditions to those
of richer opportunity and higher wage. This law applies regardless of
race. The United States being the highest wage country in the
world is the objective of all immigration. If it be maintained at
the present rate the influx will work out the other effect of the law
that brings it here. No organization and no artificial contrivance
can prevent the fall of our wage scale toward that of the European
countries from which we are receiving these millions of immigrants.
When our Chinese population was at its highest figure its effect
upon wages was imperceptible compared with what is sure to follow
the coming of the millions of immigrants that are flocking here from
Europe. So the effect |of the few thousand Japanese that are here
is inconsiderable compared to that produced by the Southern and
Southeastern Europeans. If we put Japanese exclusion upon the
wage question, and close the door to them while leaving it open to
Europeans, we are stopping the spigot -only and leaving the bung
open. One needs only to visit the immigrant quarters in the large
Eastern cities to discover that the Japanese and even the Chinese
do not suffer in comparison with their fellow immigrants from Eu
rope in any of the respects in which immigrants are to be studied in
the light of their economic effect upon the country.
In one feature only is there a difference. The Europeans bring
a large annual reinforcement of our voting population. - They can
become citizens. The Asiatics cannot. The Europeans eagerly seize
the advantage of citizenship, and enable the country to point with
pride to a constantly increasing poll list of electors. In other re
spects the assimilation of the European immigration is slower as its
numbers increase. Of many nationalities there are millions here
already, and it is natural only that they seek contact with their fel
lows and the effect is to retard assimilation. It is quite doubtful,
too. whether the country has anything to gain from assimilation. It
is quite possible that our national character in the future would be
bettered by building it on stock that has been for generations in the
country, or that belongs to the Northern Europe nations, whence for
the most part our original American stock was derived.
Returning to the single question of Japanese exclusion, it must
be had by the same means that we used to exclude the Chinese. The
.Supreme Court of the United States has pointed out the way. We
have a commercial treaty with Japan, in which occurs this clause:
"It is, however, understood that the stipulations contained in this and
the preceding article do not in any way affect the laws, ordinances
and regulations with regard to trade, the immigration of laborers,
police and public security which are in force, or which may here
after be enacted, in either of the two countries."
That language puts Japanese in this country upon an exact
equality with immigrants from any other country, and bestows upon
Americans in Japan a like equality. Instead of meaning that either
nation may exclude the people of the other, while admitting the
people of all other nations, it means that Japanese in the United
States shall be upon a perfect equality with other foreigners under
â¢ u\r laws, and that Americans in Japan shall enjoy the same equality
there.
The interpretation of that clause has been already discussed by
the two governments, and it is well understood to mean that what
ever laws we pass applying to all immigration and to all foreign la
borers shall apply to Japan. It is no grant of authority to Japan to
exclude only American trade and only American immigration. It is
intended to give American trade and American immigration to Japan
the same rights that are given to all foreign trade and all foreign im
migration.
This proper interpretation of the treaty puts the matter on all
fOMfl with the case of China. We had the Burlingame treaty of
commerce and immigration with China. When it was conceived that
Chinese immigration was harmful to us. we made several ineffective
attempt? at exclusion, which were voided by the courts. Finally the
Supreme Court of the United States, in an opinion written by Mr.
Justice Field, pointed out that exclusion legislation must be based
upon an amendment to the treaty. We sent a special embassy to
( hina and secured the desired amendment and exclusion legislation
followed. If we want to exclude the Japanese we must take the
same course. The Japanese Government has already let it be known
that it will not assent to any treatment of its subjects different from
That given to the people of other nations. In other words, it adheres
to the equality of treatment secured in the clause of the treaty
above quoted.
To advise that we proceed against Japan with that treaty in ex
istence is to advise mischief. To exclude the Japanese from this
country i< well, and it will be found to carry with it equally rigid
exclusion of our people and our commerce from Japan, which per
hap> is well also.
A NEW CHINATOWN.
ORIENTALISM made into a far more picturesque feature of our
city than it ever has been is now a prospect brought nearer
to fulfillment by the active work purposed to be begun next
week for persuading property holders to consent to the tearing down
of old Chinatown and the building of a new Oriental city on the
bay shore.
The plan proposed is to induce two-thirds of the holders of
Chinatown property to consent to the change, and this majority it is
expected would insure success. Bonds are to be issued to the amount
of $7,500,000, and the inducement to the property holders is to
be thtt in addition to the face value of their property, repre
sented by stock, they are to have, in proportion to the stock they
hold, one-third of the profits of the corporation, and also a one
rhird interest in the new Chinese city.
It is usually the bnsiness consideration which determines whether
I fair dream of betterment may be made reality, and this project as
a business venture seems good. The present Chinatown is assessed
*: 53.000.000. the corporation values it at double that, and esti
mates that, with the buildings removed, the ground alone- would
increase fourfold in value. This calculation does not seem unreas
onable. The proportion of Chinese owners is so small that so far as
<rntiment could control in the matter the American wish would
settle the question, and that should be in favor of the removal.
\\ ere there no other reasons, sanitary considerations would be
sufficient argument for the proposed change : but the opportunity it
would give for covering the fim uprise of our hills from the bay
with beautiful buildings, which would not only show the city to ad
â¢ antage to visitors approaching by water, but give to all who used
those buildings fine views of the bay and shipping, affords a pros
pect to which all could look forward with civic pleasure.

laughed, "but you cannot have indi
gestion and the fires of genius within
you at the same time."
"But I have a splendid digestion,"
he persisted. "Four meals a day never
feaze me."
"Poets," counseled Nettie, "never
have regular meals. When they lead
regular lives they cease to become
geniuses."
"But that's all tommyrot," he de
clared loftily. "I can be a genius and
have the comforts of life, can't I?"
"If you are a very great genius,
Jerry, you may be able to live those
handicaps down, but few men write
good checks and good verse at the

"So that is what he meant," mused
Miss Ainsworth.
"What's what who meant?" demand
ed Gerald.
"Why, Bob said he had been to see
you the other evening and had had one
of the best laughs he has enjoyed in a
lung time," she explained.
"He told me they were good."
"No," explained Nettie. "I think you
will find that he said they were great."
"It's the same thing."
" 'Great' is a word capable of a wider
latitude of definition," she reminded
him. "Read me some of the verses."
'â¢You'll laugh, " he contended.
"No," she promised. "I'll be very
good and quiet."
he began bashfully:
"My lady's eyes are blue and kind,
Her charms are charms of face and
mind,
Her equal would be hard to find,
*Tis she I love most dearly.
My lady's face Is pure and sweet,
My lady's hair is dainty neat,
And trim her tiny little feet.
And she's an angel, nearly."
"I think that last line needs a little
polishing," said Miss Ainsworth grave
ly. "The lady of the lines might ob
ject to being called a near-angel. '
"I say,' cried Gerald in shocked
tones, "you don't suppose I meant that,
do you? That's poetic license; to
make the rhyme, you know."
"Suppose you make it. 'And she's an
angel, clearly,' " suggested Nettle.
"That would be more polite.
Gerry's face brightened. "Its aw
fully good of you to suggest that," he
said. "It's a whole lot better."
"Is there a second verse?" asked
Nettie.
"Not yet," admitted Gerry, color
ing. "You see, the different verses
should be alike in meter. Now when I
start a second verse it sounds different.
I had a second verse to this. It goes:
"I never loved another girl
With half the tender passion
That keeps my head all in a whirl
In this unusual fashion.
If she would only give her love
To one who loves her dearly,
I'd think the stars in heaven above
Like her eyes shone more clearly."
He paused expectantly. Miss Ains
worth admitted that the verses were
scarcely of the same metrical meas
urement.
"I think," observed Gerry, "that I'll
have the verse done in a booklet where
there is only one verse to every other
page and the rest of the paper is
covered with pictures. Then you see
it would not matter so much."
"You should be an inventor, Gerry,"
counseled Miss Ainsworth. "I think
you are more ingenious than poetical."
"But I want to be a poet," he pro
tested. "I've got such a lot of things
that I dare not say to the girl herself.
It's the only way to let them come
out."
Nettie* smiled. "Now it all comes
out," she declared. "Who is the lady,
Gerry?"
"I cannot tell you," said Goodsell,
his face crimsoning. "You see if I

the case of the New York and Bermu
das Asphalt Company must remain In
â¢ he courts.
WASHINGTON, March 24.â Minister
Bowen's cablegram to the State De
partment informing the administration j
that President Castro of Venezuela had
refused explicitly to submit to arbitra
tion, the pending issue between the
United States and Venezuela, and de- j
daring that the asphalt cases must
be adjudicated by the Venezuelan
courts, formed the principal topic of
discussion at to-day's meeting of the â 
Â«Jabinet- That the situation is not re- ;
tarded as acute at this time was indi
cated dearly by the determination of
the President and his advisers to pay
co present heed to President Castro's
refusal to arbitrate the existing dif- !
ferencea. It is the indicated intention
cf the President and Secretary Taft.
who, In the absence of Secretary Hay,
is being relied on for advice in mat
ters pertaining to foreign affairs, to
cwa:t further developments In Vene
zuela- It is not believed thx_t the situ
ation It of such a character as to war
rant alarm. Indeed, the President Is
proceeding with the arrangements for
his southwestern trip without refer
ence to the Venezuela imbroglio.
After other members of the Cabinet
had left .he White House, Secretary !
Taft and Postmaster General Cortelyou
continued with the President the dis
cussion cf the Venezuelan and Santo
Doaiingan questions. No determination
â¢was reached which would Involve dras
tic action en the part of the American
Government. It is regarded as possi
ble that further developments in the
Venezuelan situation may be forthcom
ing in a few dors, but it is not be
lieved here they will add to its seri
ousness.
MOT RELEASE THE SAILORS.
THE HAGUE, March â The
Government of The Netherlands In
tends, " either alone or in conjunction
with other powers having differences j
with Venezuela, to take vigorous !
measures to secure the release of the j
SvÂ« Dutch sailors Illegally imprisoned 'â 
for seven month* in that country. It \
:Â« thought probable that in the event ]
of there being no material change in j
the situation in the Far East some of]
The Netherlands warships maintain- j
ing neutrality in the Dutch East In- I

waters in ilay.

MSTAD. March 24.â President
Castro is still living r.e^r Maracay,
where dancing takes place nearly every
night. Orders presumably given by the
President were issued to have ail guns
lately bought in France used for drill
asd target practice. The two big can
non just mounted at La Guayra, oppo
site the French Cable Company's office
were fired yesterday morning for two
hours in the direction of Cano Blanco.
The concussion in La Guayra was so
Fever? that nearly all the bottles in the
German drugstore of Valentiner &
Braun fell from the shelves and were
broken. Windows in many houses were
frr.ashed. La Guayra has two other big
guns mounted on Fort Puerto Cabello,
two on the fort of Lavijla and Mara
caibo and three placed at the entrance
ef the bar on Fort San Carlos. All
thÂ«6e were also fired yesterday. They
are new cannon, ten-centimeter rifles
originally ordered by the Boers, but

ThÂ« Influence of heredity- oar. not of J
course, be successfully disputed, but
It can be minimised or entirely over- :
come In some cases by correct food
[ and drink. A Connecticut lady says: i
"For years while I was a coffee
drinker I suffered from bilious at-
tacks of great severity, from which I
used to emerge as white as a ghost
and very weak. Our family physician \
gave me various prescriptions for im-
proving the digestion and .stimulat-
ing the liver, which I tried faithfully,
bat without perceptible result. He
was acQuaintd with my family his-
tory for several generations back, and
once when I visited him he said: 'If
you have inherited one of those tor-
pid livers you may always suffer more
or less from Its inaction. We can't
dodge our Inheritance, you know.* *
**I was not so strong a believer In
heredity as he was. however, and, be-
ginning to think for myself, I con-
cluded to stop drinking coffee and see
â¢what effect that would have. I feared
It would be a severe trial to give It '
up, but when I took Postum and had
*it well made It completely filled my
need for a hot beverage and I grew
very fond of it.
"I have used the Postum Coffee for I
three years, using no medicine, and
the change has completely cured me.
Durifcg all that time I have had abso-
lutely none of the bilious attacks that
I used to suffer from, and I have been !
entirely free from the pain and debil- â 
itating effects that used to result from
them. The change Is *~ surely very
great and I am compelled to give Pos- j
turn Coffee the exclusive credit for it." i

Case of Black Republic
SAN DOMINGO. March 24.âPresi
dent Morale*' Council of Ministers is
discussing the question of asking the
United States to take Sanchea and
Samana under American protection
under the terms of the arbitration
award, in order to prevent their seizure
by persons hostile to the Government.
A newspaper organ of the opposition
party haa bitterly attacked President
Morales, charging him with disloyalty
and declaring he has been losing
ground daily since last June. There is
â  activity in the forts and in the city,
and the street guards have been dou
bled.
The American gunboat Caatine is on
the alert, ready to land seventy men at
a moment's notice to protect American
interests. The marines have their cart
ridge belts filled and all precautions
have been taken in view of a possible
outbreak. There is a signal station
on the roof of the American consulate.
WASHINGTON March 24.â The sit
uation In San Domingo was fully dis
cuÂ»*ed to-day at the Cabinet meeting.
No new phases of the question have
arisen within a few days, and the ad
ministration will not make any present
; change tn ltÂ» indicated method of pro
cedure.
The failure of the Senate to ratify
the treaty with the Dominican Govern
ment haa embarrassed the administra
tion, and nothing now will be done ex
' cept to Initiate an investigation Into
the affairs of the Island Government
â¢ with a view simply to obtain definite
information. The present status on
the island so far as this Government
is concerned will not be disturbed-
AGREEMENT NOT KEPT.
BRUSSELS, March 24.â The protests
of the Belgian Government and of the
French and Belgian bondholders of San
Domingo are s*.id to be due to San
Domingo's non-observance of the
agreement concluded with the bond
holders Â«- J- c 3, 1901. to pay toward
the liquidation of the public debt $25.
000 monthly out of the customs re
ceipts of the port of San Domingo.
The largest of the foreign debts of
San Domingo is that represented by
the bonds of the new unified loan of
IS9T. held in Europe, principally In
France and Belgium, consisting of two
issues bearing respectively 2 and 3 and
4 per cent interest and amounting to
about $21,250,000. Both classes of
bonds â were secured on customs duties
specially assigned revenues. De
fault in the payment of interest was
made April 1. 1599, since which time
several arrangements have been at
tempted to provide for the interest
payment*. Belgians hold about $6,
000,000 of Dominican bonds.
FRANCE KEEPS HANDS OFF.
PARIS. March 24. â The authorities
here say that no steps are being con
sidered relative to pressing the French ;
claims against San Domingo. It is ;
explained that the French holders of i
Dominican bonds hoped the United !
States Senate would ratify the treaty i
adjusting the finances of San Do- j
mingo. and the bondholders were
much disappoinuted at the fact that
action was deferred. However, they
have taken steps to secure Govern
ment Intervention, and the Govern
ment has not yet shown a disposition
to assume the collection of the debt
by the adoption of drastic measures.
The officials here say the total
amount of Dominican bonds held in
Europe Is about J21.000.000. divided
in order of Importance between Bel
gium. France. Holland and Germany.
Although Belgium is chiefly interested,
the authorities point out that she is
a neutral power, not having the means
to adopt coercive measures.
nee approached the United
States some months since with the
view to securing details of the Do
minican sources of revenue, but these
proved so complicated that the offi
cials entertain little hope of utilising
the revenues as a means of liquidating
the foreign bonds.
BERLIN. March 24. â The Foreign
Office, replying to an inquiry as to
whether the report that Great Britain
and Germany were pressing San Do
- a settlement of the claims
of British and German subjects was
correct, said the Germ?n Government
was satisfied to leave San Domingo
and her obligations to foreigners en- |
tirely in the hands of the United
States.

Accident to Judge Prewett
Delays Sentence of Youth
Who Took Mother's Life
Special rxÂ»p*tclr to ThÂ« CsJl.
AUBURN, March 24.â Adolph Weber,
who was convicted of the murder of
his mother, will not be sentenced next
Monday. An accident to Judge Prew
ett is the cause ot the delay.
Just now the prisoner is having a
spat with his lawyers. He wants to
dismiss Attorneys Johnson and Tabor.
He has already written Tabor a letter
notifying him his services are no longer
required. Yesterday a physician from
Sacramento, Dr. Twitchell. visited
Weber In his cell In company with
Weber's attorneys. The visit gave rise
to the belief that the insanity plea
would be made to secure delay. Web
er's answers to the doctor's queries,
however, were more accurate than
could have been give* by any of those
present.
When the doctor had finished his ex
amination, Weber asked him for a
health certificate. When this was re
fused, Weber said indignantly: "I
want one for my own protection; some
one may say I am insane," Weber is
enjoying the best of health.

ATHLETIC FIELD
DRAWS CRACK UNIVERSITY SPRINTERS AND JUMPERS
IN ANTICIPATION OF INTERCOLLEGIATE CHAMPIONSHIPS
TENNIS EXPERTS
HAVE NEW GAME
Rackets Will Be Wielded
on an Indoor Court for
the First Time Here
BEST PLAYERS ENTERED
Innovation Will Be Tried
luder the Most Favor
able of Circumstances
The principal topic . of conversation
among the tennis enthusiasts at pres
ent ie the indoor tournament which will
be held early in April in - connection
with the Forest, Fish and Game show
at Mechanics Pavilion. The court has
been laid out and several of the cracks
who have tiled it during the week pay
Uie players will be able to do fully as
well on it as they do on the asphalt.
The game will be somewhat faster, but
the cracks can easily accustom them
selves to this condition.- . - .
The committee io" charge has decided
to finish both events down to the semi
flnals to-morrow on the park .courts.
The weather hap made It Impossible to
accomplish much in the la?t two weeks
and by playing. bothVvents at the park
much time will be saved.
Only three matches remain in the
preliminary round of the doubles while
one team has already reached the llrst
round. The default of Drs. Hit! and
McChesney is to be regretted as they
were cne of the strongest teams en
tered. They would surely have reached
the finals where they could be depend
ed upon to put up a good exhibition.
With Hill and McChesney out of it
Foley and Dunlap are easily the best
team in the lower half. Th*?e two
teams would have furnished an excit
ing match.
The upper half contains an abund
Â«'ice of good teams and it is. a pity
come of them will have to be weeded
out. â¢ - â¢
In the preliminary round th* three
matches to be played are: Hall and
Sob^y vs. Long and Gardner, Otis and
Oliphant vs. Powell and Lombard, and
Dunlap and Foley vs. Ilenyon and
Partner. Some excellent matches will
no doubt be played to-morrow. The
lirst will be between Whitney and Grif
fir. and Schmidt and Jlolfe; the. second
between the Baker brothers and Gard
ner and Long and the third between
the winner of this match and Long and
Janes. It is almost a sure thing the
opponent* of Long and Janes will be
tiie Baker brothers, as many consider
them the strongest team in the tourna
ment. *
â¢In the singles much more progress
has been made. All the preliminary
round has been completed and only two
matches remain to be played in the
rirst round. In the lower half C.- Griffin
has won one of the semi-final matches.
Griffin is a clever player and will give
a good account of himself at the pavil
ion. Janes' defeat of â¢ Foley -last Sun
day makes it look as If he would be
Griffins opponent in the semi-finals.
These two would furnish an excellent
match. Janes must, however, first dis
pose of such cracks as M. Long,
Hotchkiss and Dunlap. â  â¢ Â»
In the upper half J. A. Code is the
only man who has reached the third
round. His chances', of reaching the
semi-finals do not look good, as he will
be pitted neairÂ«* Nell P.nknr or ' '.
Gardner in the third round. Baker is
expected to beat Gardner and get one
of the semi-final places in his hair. Th
other place undoubtedly lies, between
Schmidt. Rolfe and Adams.
The California Club has sent out no
tices for a class singles tournament, to
be played a week from to-morrow.
Play will be confined to the second and
fourth clashes. These events will be
the first of a series of class tourna
ments for the new Directors' cups,
which must be won three times.
The Golden Gate Tenni? Club will
hold a handicap doubles tournament on
the same date.

Sufficient Number of the
/â¢Little Flyers Received
to Run but One Stake
Although there are nearly 400 grey
bounds in training at the present time
only fifty-six of thepe will stretch their
muscle? this week on Union Park
field. The problem of securing hares
in sufficient numbers to keep two parks
going has not been solved. The San
Joaquin Valley hares are supposed to
have gone into the foothills in quest
of fresh fcod. The men who are fa
miliar with their habits expect them
back in the valley in June, when the
grass will be dry.
In the meantime small stakes will be
run for the fleetest dogs in an effort
to keep up the increasing interest
shown in the game.
Owing to the large number of grey
hounds from which to make selections,
the Union - Park management " claims
this week's stake is the highest class
fifty -six dog event ever drawn here.
Forty-nine of those entered have fig
ured ,as stake- winners. The coursing

Concatenation of Hoo-Hoos.
The lumbermen of the northern dis
trict of California who are members
of the Concatenated Order of Hoo-
Hoos, the official insignia of which is
a black cat. will hold a grand concate
nation in the Odd Fellows" building to
night. The purpose of this is
explained in the following from a cir
( ular sent out by Henry Templeman,
secretary and treasurer of the Mendo
< mo Lumber Company, whois the vice
gerent Biiark of the Hoo-Hoos for this
district: "The cats are howling in the
onion bed and there 'are a number of
kittens awaiting to enter. the classic
precincts of the Hoo-Hooland to partake
of incense and myrrh." The Hoo-Hoos
recently held a very successful con
catenation in Oakland, when twenty
kittens were made acquainted with the
bowline mysteries of the order.
COUNCIL'S CUP
IN GRAVE PERIL
Three Ladies Are Resolved
to Capture It in Next
Competition at Presidio
EACH HAS WON TWICE
Third Victory of Any One
Will Seal the Doom of
Handsome Silver Trophy
As the fipst handicap tournament of
the northern division of the newly or
ganised California Women Golfers" As
sociation is to take place on April 5 on
the course of the San Francisco Golf
and Country Club, the competition for
the eounc'l's cip for women, which is
s*:t down on the schedule of the wom
en* annex for April 4 to 7, inclusive,
will be h?ld next week.
Ac not more than eight ladies are
likely to enter the council's cup com
petition, there will be no need of a
qualifying round, so that the drawing
it pairs for the match play will be
made on Tuesday, the 28th inst. The
winner? in Tuesday"* matches will pro
ceed to tho semi-nnal round on
Wednesday, and the two winners on
that day will play in the final round
on Thursday.
The c-'nip'-tition. which is the third
that hap tak^n place for the trophy
during the present season, will be un
usually interesting, as three fair golf
ers have won two competitions apiece.
These are Mrs. li. Gilman Brown, Mrs.
J. R. Clark and Mrs. W. G. Miller. A
third victory fnr any one of thesÂ«
Hdles will make the handsome silver
tiophy her property for all time. As
all the three are playing regularly and
each proclaims her fixed intention of
annexing the cup, the battle will be 0
koen one. The trophy is .1 silver loving
cup, and each fair contestant is grip
ping one ot its three handles with both
hands.
A petition, signed by about 130 in
structors and students, that ground be
set aside f< r a golf course was present
ed recently to the trustees of Stanford
University. Dr. Jordan, before his de
parture for Honolulu, stated the peti
tion had hoen granted, but that the
termÂ« of the lease had not been dis
till* ii It is not likely much will be
done in the matter sooner than the
fall.
The Waverly Golf Club of Portland
is making arrangements 10 hold a con
test for the golf championship of the
Pacific Coast In June, and has invited
members of the clubs of California.
Washington, Oregon, Utah, Idaho and

test, which is expected to be the largest

YOUNG ATHLETES
ARE EXPECTANT
(ireat Doings Are Looked
Forward To To-Day on the
Berkeley Cinder Path
Interest in high school circles is at
fever pitch and will remain so unlil
the supremacy of the Bay Counties
Athletic League is decided to-day at
Berkeley oval. Of the ten schools com
prising the league, the most likely can
didates for first ylace are Lick, Oak
land, Berkeley and Lowell. The result
will be so clos<? that in all probability
the decision will rest with the relay
race, the winner of this event harvest
ing ten points, a number sufficient, as
ii has been shown repeatedly, to give
the winning school an overpowering
lead.
Oakland High school won the event
last autumn and has practically thn
same team with one exception. Lick,
although losing in the last meet, still
possesses "Chick" O'Connor, Johns and
Roy Dodson, members of the crack
team which holds the United States in
terso^olastic relay record. Lick also
haÂ«Â» several othtr fast runners. Berke
ley Uj being coached by "Billy" Pow
ell. , That is sufficient to make all other
competitors anxious, for it was he who
took a raw bunch of unknown and un
thought-of Lick men and in a few
months turned out a star team that
took all three field days last spring and
discovered such performers as Cope
and Beck. Thus with Powell at Berke
ley there is a dark horse in the run
ning and one not to be despised.
Many "unknowns" will participate,
and from various sources rumors are
h^ard of great sprinters and jumpers,
which means a general smashing of
records. In the 50-yard dash Hal Sites
and " Judge """Hall of Oakland will do
stunts with Crosfleld and Miller of
Berkeley and Lick, respectively, to
help make things interesting.
The 880-yard, run should be a great
race from start to finish between
Mayes of Lick. Maundrell of Lowell
and Miller from the college town
school. Sanguine Lowellites have de
cided by consulting the "dope" to give
Myer. Garvin and Lang all the places
in the two-mile, but they are liable to
a surprise.
Some say: "Lick has something up
her sleeve." Ed Dozier, track captain
Of Oakland, thinks the hurdles look
good to him, but he would better con
sult Doane of Lick and Barkan of the
Sutt^r street delegation. No one has
nerve enough to think of beating
Mkundrell in the mile. The plucky lad
will probably knock a few seconds from
his record.
The stars of the field events are few
but noticeable. "Capt." Moullen, the
Lick "stand-by," will take in all prob
ability flrst place in the pole vault,
hammer throw and shot put. Hall,
Oakland's record holder in the high
Jump, will take care of a flrst rank in
this event, while Whitman, the Berke
ley captain, will walk through the air
for fly*Â» points in the broad Jump.

The members of the Ariel Rowing
Club are manifesting great activity,
nearly a hundred being at the boat
house each Sunday. Many of these
remain about the quarters throughout
the day enjoying quiet spins in barges
or skiffs without a thought of racing.
Now that the duck shooting season
is over, the members of the Precita
and Sobrante gun clubs, all of whom
are Ariels, visit the boathouse regu
larly, among them being J. yon Sta
den, N. A. Denvir, J. Lewis, L. My

E. Murphy stroke. Herman Opelt is
having a shell tuiilt and will enter the
next junior shell race. Several mem
bers of the Ariel Rowing Club rowed
from the boathouse to North Beach
last Sunday, returning after lunch-
eon. The party was made up of C.
Davis, W. McKee, E. Smith and J.
yon Staden in the barge Ariel; N. A.

house of the South End and Ariel
clubs.
The motor boat being built by Mr.
Harris and his two sons is nearly
ready and will be launched in about
two weeks. Pome experts who have
seen the launch say she is an excellent
piece of work and would be credit
able to any professional. She will be
equipped with a fifteen horsepower
Buffalo marine engine and is expect
ed to make good speed.
LOUIS LEVY MAY BE
WORKS BOARD SECRETARY
Present Deputy Health Officer Men-
tioned for Job to Be Given Up
by Incumbent.
It was learned yesterday on good
authority that Louis Levy, at present
Deputy Health Officer, will be ap
pointed to succeed Morris Levy as sec
retary of the Board of Public Works.
Morris Levy has been granted a six
months' leave of absence, but it is un
derstood that he will sever his connec
tion with the position permanently.
Louis Levy has drawn but little salary
since he assumed his present place
on account of injunction suits. The
salary of the two positions is the
same â $150 per month â with this dif
ference, that the secretary of the
Board of Works "gets his," Levy says.
Morris Levy's leave begins on April 1
and Louis Levy's new appointment will
probably be given to him on that date.
No mention is made of the man who
will succeed the last named Levy as
Deputy Health Officer.
STEAMSHIP DAKOTA MAKES
SUCCESSFUL TRIAL TRIP
NEW LONDON, Conn.. March 24. â
The steamship Dakota, owned by the
Great Northern Steamship Company,
returned to-day after a trial trip of
twenty-four hours. During the trip
her compasses were adjusted and her
machinery was given a thorough trial.
It is expected that the Dakota will
make her final departure from New
London early next week for Pacific
waters.
FOOTBALL MEN
IN CUP MATCH
Vampires and Hornets Will
Play in Semi-Final Round
for Association Trophy
ELLIOT JOINS OAKLAND
Placer County Athlete Is
Expected to Add Strength
to Alamed County Eleven
The Vampires, having drawn the bye
in the opening round of matches for
the California Association Football
Union cup, reach the semi-final round
without a contest. They will meet the
Oakland Hornets to-morrow at 2:30 â¢
p. m. on the Presidio Athletic Grounds.
The latter defeated the Pickwicks de
cisively in the match in the first round.
Hush Williamson will be the referee.
The Hornets' team has been playing
together better each week, and is a
strong eleven, picked from seventeen
or eighteen jjood players. H. G. Macart
ney of the Association
Football Club has been playing a fine
game for the Hornets on the left wing.
The Hornets are to be strengthened
still more by the addition of H. Elliott
of Auburn. IMaeer County, 'who. like
Macartney, is a good cricketer as well
an a clever association footballer.
One of the two matches that remain
to complete the schedule for the 1904
1905 championship of the California
Association Football League will be
played to-morrow an the Presidio Ath
letic Grounds as a "curtain raiser" to
the cup match. The Pickwicks will
meet the Independents, the ball being
kicked off at 12:30 p. m., with C. W.
Irish as referee. The result of the
match, whatever it may be, will not
alter the position of either of the teams
in the league table.
The Kagles go to Sacramento to
morrow to play a friendly match
n gainst the Sacramento Association
Football Club in Oak Park.
Twenty-five members of the Sacra
mento Club took part in a lively prac
tice game last Sunday at Oak Park,
Pardeau acting as referee and Read
man as linesman. The forwards, espe
cially the left wing and center, showed
good form, the tricky work of Button,
Bowden and Wright furnishing much
amusement to the spectators. William
son did good work in goal and Hob
itaille on the fullback line. The game
was enjoyed by both players and spec
tators.
On Sunday, April 2, the residents of
Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley will
have an opportunity to see a cup
match on their side of the bay. The Al
bion Rovers will meet the Independents
in the f?pmi-final round for the Union
cup at Freeman's Park, Golden Gate,
on that day.
So many severe criticisms have been
made recently upon university football
that the chances of the association
game being taken up vigorously at
American colleges have been much im
proved. At Harvard Dr. Eliot's com
ments have made it likely the associa
tion game will take root there. Chal
lenges have been received from several
American teams, and a match may be
arranged with the Corinthian eleven,
which will visit this country from Eng
land next summer. The advocates of
the game are chiefly students who have,
resided abroad and have played it In
Great Fritain, Canada and other
countries.

STURDY COLLEGIANS
IN RARE CONDITION
Blue and Gold Has Two Score Tennis Enthusiasts
Striving for a Place on Its Team.
1 BERKELEY, March 24.â Forty uni
versity men are candidates for the
honor of representing their college on
the intercollegiate tennis team which
will be selected during the next twen-
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ATHLETES. OF WHOM GOOD PERFORMANCES ARE EXPECTED.
ty-four hours. Try outs are being held
almost daily and gradually the leas
skilled players are being eliminated.
The best racquet wielders in the uni
versity art- entered in the contest. They
have been notified by the committee in
charge that all tryouts must be com
pleted by xhe 25th inst. This will give
the winners time for about three weeks
of practice before meeting Stanford on
April 16.
In other days at the University of
California the winner of the tourna
ment and the runner us won the dis
tinction of representing the university
at the intercollegiate match, but this
year the last eight men, including all
of those who reach the final round in
the tryouts, will play a round robin
tourney for the two places on the team.
Experts predict the last eight to com
pete will probably include: Rolfe, Gor
rili, Harper, Lane. Wayne, Schmidt, N.
Baker and R. F. H. Varlel. Rolfe is a
San Francisco youth, whose consistent
playing Is expected to return him a
winner. Claude Wayne, Herbert
Schmidt. Neil Baker and Variel are
picked by many as the four who will
contest last for the team honors.
Stanford's for a postpone
ment of the baseball dates was refused
by the executive committee of tUe as
sociated students because such post
ponement, in the opinion of the authori
ties, would throw the baseball contests
too far along in the vicinity of the
spring "exams." Stanford's reason for
desiring a postponement was that Mrs.
Stanford's death had made It imprac
ticable to carry out plans for practice
wprk in athletics at the university. The
games, however, will be played as orig
inally scheduled.
All the crack oarsmen of the univer
sity will be in evidence on the Oak
land estuary to-morrow afternoon,
when the lnterclass .races are to be
held, they having been postponed/ from
charter day, last Thursday. The class
crews were chosen by Coach Garnett
last Tuesday and announced by him at
that time. There will be considerable
interest manifested in the varying
styWs of stroke taught- different- crews
by Garnett. he having given the row
ing men a taste of the Oxford and
Harvard style of stroke, with varia
tions for some of the crews. In order to
get at the best style adapted for the
college men's abilities.
Graduate .Manager Decoto is expect
ed to have his report regarding the
conference he will hold with Manager
Barrett of Stanford about a permanent
boating course, ready by next Tuesday
night, when the executive committee of
the associated students is to meet. The
committee has tried to dispose of the
v*xed question of a choice of courses
by delegating to Decoto the task of
agreeing with Barrett upon a course
which shall be used this year, and in
all subsequent years. Until i this Is
done, there is no telling where Califor
nia vill row Stanford this year, or if
there will be a race between them.
The accident to Trainer Christie's
eye has taken him from the cinder path
for a few days, but his absence for a
brief period is not regarded as being
likely to seriously impair the univer
sity's chances of defeating Stanford on
the track and field next moruh. The
men are gradually developing speed
and stamina, and Christie continues to
repeat that If the good work Is kept up
the cardinal colors will be lowered on
April 15.
1hÂ«Â» baseball team under Jack Mc-
Carthy's tutelage is practicing steadily,
all of tLc players being in good shape,

CARDINAL MEN ARE QUIET.
.STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March
24. â Owing to the death of Mrs. Stan
ford all athletics at the university
have been called ofT. The men are do
ing only the light work that is re
quired to keep them in shape for thÂ«
Intercollegiate contests with Califor
nia next month.
Stanford received the news that
California would consent to row on
another course than the Oakland es
tuary with great joy. The boatmen
of the cardinal crew were anxious for
the match, but they did not feel thÂ«y
should be required to row on rough
water such as they had never prac
ticed on. Now that this point is de
cided the people of the coast who are
interested In boat racing will have an
opportunity of witnessing the flrst
real intercollegiate contest on the wa
ter between Stanford and the Univer
sity of California.
It is, of course, far too early in the
season to be able to tell what strength
the cardinal will have on the water
this year. Boating is still so new at
Stanford that there are no previous
seasons with which to compare thia
year's crew, it is safe to *ay. how
ever, that the intercollegiate regatta
this year will be far superior to the
race of last year. The cardinal crew
launched a new Cornell 3hell at Red
wood early this week,. Contrary to
expectations, little difficulty was ex
perienced in rowing the new boat anÂ«l
after a few minutes the four felt as
much at home as they did in t!M old
barge. Practice will be continued in
this speedy racing shell every after
noon until the time of the intercolle
giate contest.

X'ncle Hank wants to take his ball
team to the big league. He feels he
has a license to make that excursion,
Yesterday afternoon his '05 layout
played the game of snowball with the
pride of the windy City, scoring once
in thÂ«Â» eleventh round and incidentally
keeping the stars from o'er the Rock
ies away from the rubber for just
twenty spasms without a break.
Score â Francisco, 1 ; Chicago. 0.
San Francisco played far better
baseball than the men from Chicago.
They fielded better, were just as nifty
in traversing the sacks and had the
vantage of coming through with the ,
big hit hen it was needed to break up
the game. Chicago could be swing
ing yet without doing any damage to
the slants of Mr. Whalen or Mr.
Wheeler. j,-
It was hard work for either team to j
tear off base hits, for the pitchers
seemed, to have . stowed away an un
usual amount or cunning, which they
handed, to the batsmen i in -such
bunches that the malting of 'base hits
was a task far. above the. ability of
most: of the batters. Chicago tore off
two more than did the Seals, , tint none,
of them . figured, so the damage cannot
be counted.. ; - â¢ â¢ â â â  . ..... ,-.â¢ "
HILDEBRAND'S TIMELY HIT. \
-L.itths <J*orge Hildebrand broke the
game up in the eleventh spasm, when
the fans were beginning to wonder
when dinner time was due. Ike Wal
ters took a free pass from Mr. Brown
and Kid Mohler put him down the line
with a bunt. Spencer's out let Ike go
to third and all was done for the day
when Hilde swung through to right
field. Â â â ;..C
The Seals might have broken it up
in the ninth had not the hit and run
signal gone to the bad. Xealon open
Â«l up the round by beating a wiggler
to third. Gochnauer laid down a bunt
that Kling hurled to second too late
to head off Nealon. Shea put both
along with a sacrifice, but Wheeler did
Dot connect with the next out when
the hit and run signal was tipped, so
Xealon died at the pan, â.'. -i
The fielding of Hank's lads was bet
ter than one sees even in the big
league. Not till the eleventh spasm
whs an error committed. Then Danny
Shea threw badly to second in an ef
. fort to head off Mitc&elLr.. Incidentally
the Seals went. " through-. -.--^nineteen
rounds of baseball without making a
mistake, which certainly. looks like the
'real McCoy" at the beginning Ot the
-on. : '"'"' *\ : r"' t^X"':^'
WHAI I \ ALLOWS BIT OM^HIT.
Whalen officiated during 'the' first ;
three rounds and allowed the big.
leaguers but one hit and fanned three.
Wlteeler came up in the fourth and
â¢â tuck during the remainder of the
ffaine. They touched him for six. "scat
tered ones. He walked only one man (
and sent another to the bench on. three
strikes. â '*' '
It looks as though Brown is the fall
pitcher against the Seals. For nine '
innings big Pfeffer; tossed the shoots
aixJ no runs happened. Brown weath- j
ered the storm for one inning, but they j
pot to him in the eleventh and won
the game. Pf^-ffer is a big fellow "with
a bunch of speed, but he was a bit
erratic in lamming 'em over the rub- I
ber, as six Seals got to first on called
Calls.
Bill Setley, an indicator man who j
iarae out in the private car of the big
U-aguers. did the umpiring and did it I
well. The teams will line up in the j
final two games this afternoon and to- â

Special Dispatch to The Call.
' CHICAGO, March 24.â Jabea White.
the lightweight champion 6f England;
Charlie Mitchell, his manager, and the
latter's son, Charles Jr., arrived in this
city this morning from Buffalo and left
at b o'clock to-night for San Francisco,
where the Briton is virtually matched
to fight Jimmy Britt. The party Is
due in San Francisco at noon on Tues
day and will attend the Hart-Johnson
right that night.
of all the boxers England has sent
across the water in search of Yankee
honors White, in the opinion of those
who secured a glimpse of him about
town during his brief stay, shapes up
best. What he will do in the ring is a
matter of conjecture.
Whites plans for his stay in America
are first to meet Jimmy Britt. If he
beats him decisively he will take on
th.c remaining good ones, such "as Bat
tling Nelson and the lightweight cham
pion, Joe Gans.
"I'm feeling fine to-day, although a
little tired from long rides. " said
White. I think my match with Britt
is made. 1 expect to meet him about
the middle of next month. The weight,
I think, as Mr. Mitchell made it, is at
th* lightweight limit â 133 pounds. I
think I will not have much trouble in
making it. They tell me Britt is a
clever man. If he beats me I will have
no excuse to offer. If I beat him, as I
hope to do, I will take on the next
best one, which they tell me Is Battling
Nelson.
"The game is slow in England just
now. I have defeated all the good ones
there and the others are afraid of me.
I have had a good many fights during
the last few years, but not a real cham
pionship affair. I was sick when com
ing over, but am feeling fine now. All
I can say is I hope to beat Britt and
all those I meet. When I have done so
I will go back home."
GREGGAIXS WILL REFEREE.
San Francisco Club Manager Will Be
Third Heavy-Welght in the Rinjr.
It was announced yesterday that
Alex Greggains would referee thÂ»
Johnson-Hart fight in Mechanics' Pa
vilion on Tuesday night. Jack Mc-
Cormick. who represents Hart, wanted
Greggains from the start. Zick
Abrams, manager for Johnson, was
satisfied, so there whs no further dis
cussion.
McCormick insists that only soft
surgical bandages ehaH be used and
that they be applied in the ring. He
had three experiences with Kid Mc-
Coy, who used the hard bandage?, and
say? he will not be caught again.
The club has invited Jabez White
and hie party, who will arrive on Tues
day, to occupy ringside seats.
WANT COMPELS
FOOTPAD'S ACT
Otho Z. Mitchell, who held up ohn
S. Webster a clerk in the Anglo-Cali
fornian Bank, at Ashbury and Hayes
streets on Thursday night, appeared
m Police Judge Mogan's court yester
day. He was instructed and arraigned
and the case continued till next Tues
day. Webster and his father, who
assisted in the capture of the young
thug, were at hand.
Mitchell is 24 years of age and a
manufacturing jeweler by occupation.
He is a native of Texas, where he was
married three years ago. He went
with his young wife to Los Angeles
about eighteen months ago and work
ed at his trade there for a year. He
came here six months ago, but he says
was unable tÂ« obtain employment.
He asserts that he committed the
hold-up In sheer desperation because
he was without funds in a strange city
with a young wife. The rent of his
rooms at 748 Folsom street, where he
and his wife had been living for about
six weeks, was paid up to next Mon
day, but having no money, he was
afraid they would be turned out. Then
he thought of playing the role of a
footpad, and, procuring a revolver, he
started out prepared for desperate
work without the knowledge of his
wife.
'â¢It was my first attempt at crime,"
he said yesterday afternoon. "If X had
not be* j ii a greenhorn at the business I
probably would not hove been caught.
I needed the money and that W* all
there is to it. I had told my wife
that if ever I got into trouble she
must not call at the jail to soe me,
but I have now changed my mind and
1 want to see her badly."
Mitchell i* a boy in appearance and
is far from having the features of a
footpad, as they are rather refined.
]?<-â  said he gave the name of diaries
Colby when arrested because he did
not want hip folks in Texas to know
of his trouble.

PRINCESS TITANIA FIRST
WITH CIGARLIGHTER NEXT
Unexpected Result of
the Handicap at
Oakland.
St George Jr. Defeats
Soufriere in a Hot
Finish.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
If Wiley could kick an empty oyster
can with vehemence enough to create
a disturbance in a country meeting
house, Cigarlighter, the crack colt from
tha Miller stable, could have won the
seven-furlong handicap yesterday at
Oakland track.
Wiley is an apprentice and means all
right, but his riding has no more pop
nor vim about it than a bottle of un
charged mineral water. Then, too,
Cigarlighter is a sluggish colt and if
the stable folks fell heavily as reported
they are entitled to no sympathy. There
were only four starters, with the Miller
entry carrying 101 pounds, a 13 to 10
favorite. It was known Ananias' own
er had endeavored to get him excused,
and the Schorr horse received little
consideration. Neither did Princess
Titania, because of a recent poor per
formance over a heavy track, but Ro
maine had a host of admirers.
WISE ONES ARE FOOLED.
The track yesterday was sloppy, with
a secure footing, and Princess Titania
fooled the unwise ones. Jakie Jones,
with his light impost, hustled the mare
away Ir the lead, opening up an ex
tended gap of daylight. Cigarlighter,
which was cut off on the back stretch
turn, fell back to last position. Both
Ananias and Romaine had enough
when the bend for tjome was reached,
and Wiley had moved into second po
sition with the favorite. Wiley, how
ever, appeared unable to make Cigar
lighter extend himself and Princess Ti
tania ran in nearly four lengths to the
good in 1:28>4.
Favorites held their own by taking
three purses. The usual crowd viewed
the racing.
As Abe Meyer, Equorum Rex and
Pal were made absentees from the 2
year-old dash through the scratching
blank, Iron Watson was installed fa
vorite. AlthoVigh the distance, five fur
longs, looked too far for Lorena M, the
filly led from start to finish. The first
choice stood a long drive, but could not
get up, finishing second. Avonella ran
third.
JERE DUXX'S COLORS IN FRONT.
Jere Dunn's useful 3-year-old. Ethel
Barrymore, left the maiden class in the
five and a half furlong sprint follow
ing-. The filly closed equal favorite with
Morita, the Napa Stock Farm entry.
Ethel had speed to burn v lading
throughout, and beating Moritit \viih
ease. Orsova, a weli-hacked one Could
not untrack herself in the going. The
show went to Angelica.
Laid 11 to 10 at one stage of the bet
ting. Taylor had the mount on the
Handspring colt, which made a show
of his field. Fay Templeton. a 30 to 1
shot, disposed of Rossbourne for the
place. Lady Fashion proved a false
alarm.
Dusty Miller looked a certainty for
the mile and three-eighthe selling af
fair and could have won with more ex
perienced handling.
CHANDLER'S POOR RIDE.
He went to the post a 13 to 10
choice. O. Chandler did well until he
was challenged by Link Jackson,
astride Major Tenny. Then he went
to pieces and lost the verdict by a
neck. War Times experienced no dif
ficulty in beating The Ladaean for the
show. The winner's odds were played
down from 12 to 6.
Garnet Ferguson's colt St. George
Jr. led Soufriere across the line a
head for the closing mile purse run.
The winner, a 7 to 5 favorite, had
Wright up and fnade all the pace.
Soufriere came fast through the
stretch, but just fell short of landing.
Forest King apparently did not fancy
the footing, finishing an ordinary
third.
TRACK NOTES.
Wright rode two winners.
Johnny Mellin was due to win a
race and the victory of Princess Ti
tania was a popular one.
Major Tenny was bid up from $500
to $900 by C. C. McCafferty. w. C.
Vivell retained the gelding.
Dusty Miller was claimed from the
fifth race for $825 by G. H. Thomas,
owner of Expedient.
Leslie Coggin paid Harry Stover
$2000 for Abe Meyer. The two-year
old Mill sport the former's colors in
the stake event this afternoon.
Libation, which won his last three
starts at New Orleans, carrying the
colors of CaDtain S. S. Brown, was
bred at the Napa Stock Farm. The
crack two-year-old is by Libertine
from Mackawo, the latter a full sister
to Dr. Leggo. On Thursday, at Xew
Orleans, Libation defeated a good
field, running four furlongs in :47 4-5.
Sir Wilfred received a slight injury
in training and will probably not be a
starter in the stake this afternoon.
CHASE DECIDES TO JOIN
. . NEW YORK HIGHLANDERS
Los Angeles Baseball Star Will Await
Settlement of His Case in
the I^ast.
LOS ANGELES, March 24.â Hal
Chase, the Los Angeles ballplayer,
who has been the subject of sharply
conflicting claims between the man
agers of the Los Angeles team of the
Pacific Coast League and Clark
Griffith, manager of the New York
Americans, and over whose services a
baseball war has been threatened beÂ»
tween the major and minor leagues,
has decided to keep his contract with
the New York team. He left this
evening on the Sunset Limited for
Montgomery. Ala., to join the New-
York American League team in prac
tice there. Chase was drafted last fall
by Manager Griffith. Manager Morley
of Los Angeles claimed the draft had
been made earlier thaoi the agreement
between the leagues provides and
therefore refused to give up Chase.
D. W. Long induced Chase to join
the New York team pending the set
tlement of the case before the base
ball committee.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 24 âThere was a pro
nounced untum in the course of prices on
tfce Stock Exchange again to-day, which was
undoubtedly due in part to the closing up
of the short contracts put out un the deciina
during the week. Yesterday's market already
showed tome symptoms that the decline had
run to. a point where effective Â»esi6tance was I
Â«ncouritered and sufficient new buylne de
mand Â»'iÂ» met to eupport prices. Bears with
uncovered short contracts accepted this warn
itg and bought to cover very generally to
<!r.y.. There was at the tame time a marked
revival in t)Te circulation of rumors of thÂ£
t.---.- ci&ss -and for be most part, identical ,
in form with those which have already served
many times, to excite a demand for stocks.
The ' s trrngth of New York Central. Union |
Pacific and Northwestern v^ a notable ca*e J
in point. The Information disseminated on I
the bresk yesterday was that control of Union
Pacific had passed from its present hand?.
To-day the, information was renewed thst buy- j
injsr of the best character, namely, in thÂ« !
i: tereÂ»t -of j>*rs.one already in control, was '
conspicuous In both New York Central and j
Union Pacific. News or rumors of this char- j
acter are of as great effect In the excitement
ti speculation as the most explicit announce
ment of plane affecting the control or opera- 1
tion of a property. The Southern iron coin.- ;
bination was another project which was pa
raded before the imagination of speculators |
*iith proved effect as shown by the wide move-.'
n-.ent in stock* of that group. " The lolrg-tJir.e
reports of a merger of lead interest* was
at.ether effective instrument' in the' upward :
movement of prices.. Old and new dividends
rumcrs also playfd their part., stocks' in the I
rubber industry b*>ing especially affe^ed. The
metropolitan stocks had the beneflt'of hopes
c! success jn securing contract* for . further
Eubways in the efforts making on behalf of
these Interests. t'olorado Fuel was still -in
Omand on the strength of its subscription
right* to new securities. A glance over the
list will show the important part played in
the recovery by stocks thus specified as un
o*r individual influences. The reversal of i
eentinient under the general market situation .
Â«sf attributed to subsidence of fears of
>Ull)amt nri'MJey. The headlong plunge in
th<? price "of foreign exchange was the pnn 'â 
cjpe! factor <n the change of sediment. Ts"Â«j
lUUcatioÃa thus given of the freedom with '
v hit h foreign money resources are becoming
available to. the New York market proved
irrear'y reassuring. The price of hang*
was vrr-inouncfd to bÂ« within measurable, dis
tance t>T the gold import point, and It was
*elt that actual need for money here would
lea/1 promptly to an Inward movement of gold.
Account Â»as taken, however, of the accom
ranyfr.? sharp iron In the sterling'' exchange
rate at Paris, which has -fallen 3 centimes in
the jpouha in two day* past, showing .a con
Â«i<lerÂ«b!e increase in the demand from that
cÂ»Btrr nri Lnndor. Estimates of the domestic
currency movement Indicated a considerable
Jots in cash by the bank? on the week's
movement, which is practically measured fty
the F-jb-trfatfury's absorption of $3,7Â«G.000 up'
to. 'Thursday night. But >he sharp liquida
tion- of he week In stocks and the large
resort tad to foreign lenders Is expected â¢to â 
result In a large contraction in the volume
of l<-,anÂ« of the banks with consequent dim- '
lr.ishm*nt\ of the surplus â  Item. The profit
taking In the last hour was well absorbed ,
and the market dosed strong and animated

future Grain and Provision*.
CHICAGO. March â From the outset the
wheat market was under the influence of In
creased shipments from Argentina,'. and \ contin
ued excellent weather conditions in the United
States.. May wheat ' opened , from %c to %\i
down to ?1 12 to $1 .129;. \ July was ; off;)i4c
to %c at 90Uc to 90% c. On the Initial break
a fair demand developed ' for the July deliv
ery, causing an advance to 90?4c.', Trading in
May, ' -however, was dull. - â¢ Large receipts In
the Northwest and extreme ' weakness at Min
neapolis accounted for the | Inactivity of I May.
As' trading progressed sentiment In the pit be
came more bearish. The main ' consideration
apparently was a growing belief that the fall
sown crop of wheat would prove of vast pro
portions Advices from various sections of
the winter wheat belt â¢ reiterated reports .of
favorable progress in the growth of the plant.

ress was construed especially bearish. â  The
condition of the crop, according to this re
port, I is excellent > for this time of the year,'
there- being 'few indications of damage.- A
feature of the report was a reference to the
fact that the plant is ' growing ' where there
has ' been failure to germinate, earlier in - the
season. With practically .no support, 'â  prices
steadily declined until May ' had . touched
$1 11%. July off to S9Â»4c. Late In the
day some recovery took place on a report that
the leaders in the May deal had , decided to
rally to the support of. that option. . The mar
ket, however, closed rather weak, with May
at $1 12%. Final quotations on July, were at
90% Â©90%, a loss of ViS^c.
Considering the weakness of wheat the com
market showed, considerable strength. â â  Higher
cables gave the market a firm - start. The
market held firm the entire day, closing prices
being almost at the highest point. May closed
at 4Â«a4@48Â«4, a loss of i. 4Â«% c. . â 
7 Sentiment : in the oats pit â  was rather bear
ish as a result of warmer weather. May
closed unchanged at 30?ic. . "-- .-;, .
Provisions were firm in sympathy with
higher prices for live hogs. May pork, lard
and ribs each closed 5c higher. â - .

WHEATâ The foreign -markets stood about
the same. Chicago was slightly lower on the
day. The wires of | E. : F. Hutton - & Co said :
"Our market was lower, influenced by the
- Argentine . shipments and â  somewhat larger re
ceipts in the Northwest, and. ln early dealings
was again subjected to pressure. * The weather
In the winter Wheat country is all that could
be desired, with the plant In splendid shape
and making rapid progress. ' These figures are
not conducive to bull markets, and while thia
condition prevails " It .seems unreasonable to
expect any advance aside from speculative ral
lies when the trade -gets -oversold.? â  The cash
markets, larger receipts and weakness in out
side markets Intensify the bearish' feeling.'- The
market to us looks : nervous and unsettled."
.-. The Modern Miller says: "Highly favorable
weather for the growing Wheat crop has de
veloped and the growth of ' plant has pro
greased ' steadily > and favorably. v Condition of
crop in general Is excellent for this time of
the year. â  there . being few Indications of Hes
sian fly. A feature of reports for the week is
the number of references to the fact that the
plant is growing; where it had failed to ger

Butter, Cheese and Egg^.
The feature of the Butter market at present
is the agitation in favor of the full-weight
square. The Governor having signed the biU
requiring every food package weighing from
eight ounces to six pounds to have Its weight
printed on the wrapper, has led to a general
movement among the Butter merchants to re
quest the. creamery and dairy men to put up
their product in full-weight squares hereafter,
ar.d if the merchants come to an agreement of
this sort notices to this effect will be sent
to all the Butter producers in the State. An
argument in favor of this is that all markets
except Pan Francisco want the â  full-wÂ»ignt
square, and our I^-lb package hurta our ship
pinjf tia'ie.
The Butter market continue* steady and un
changed and orders for the north continue.
Cheese rules steady, but some .dealers arÂ»
reporting an increase In stocks. ; .'
Eggs continue weak and the downward ten
dency-is becoming more perceptible. "The low

MERSHON'S WIFE
WINS HER CASE
The wife of James R. T. Mershon,
late Civil Service Commissioner, was
granted a divorce by Judge Kerrigan
yesterday, willful neglect being the
cause set forth in the decree. At the last
minute it was announced the Mer
shons agreed not to air their difficul
ties more than necessary, with the re
sult that Mrs. Mershon's charges of
cruelty were not pressed. Furthermore
she made no claim for alimony, a
stipulation being entered into for the
settlement of their financial affairs out
of court.
Mershon was not present in court.
Mrs. Mershon told the story of how
Mershon had neglected her, spending
his money in the pursuit of pleasure
with others. He had not properly main
tained her, she said, and had also
neglected her in a shameful manner.
Her story was corroborated and the
decree was signed without delay.
\V. E. Holbrook, the oil man. who
is suing his wife Essie for divorce,
was up before Judge Kerrigan yester
day to show cause why he should not
pay Mrs. Holbnook alimony pending
the determination of the case. Hol
brook made a plea of poverty. He said
all the money he got to maintain him
self he borrowed. Asked on what, he
said on his face. He was quite faceti
ous until the court ordered him to pay
Mrs. Holbrook 560 a month alimony,
$160 counsel fees and 525 costs.
When the case of Ferdinando Rossi
against Maria Rossi for divorce was
called yesterday morning in Judge
Hunt's court, Rossi surprised his coun
sel and the court by saying there had
been some mistake; that he did not
want a divorce. All he wanted was to
see his baby, the pleasure of whose
company his wife denied him. Mrs.
Rossi was then called to the stand and,
with flashing eyes, said it was true
she would not let Rossi see their baby
and intended to stand by her deter
mination. Judge Hunt said she should
not keep the child all to herself, and
ordered her to permit Rossi to visit
the baby every Sunday from 2 till 3
o'clock. Turning to some friends she
said in French that she would not let
her husband see the baby. Judge Hunt
asked what she had said, and on be
ing informed told her she had better
obey the mandate of the court or she
would be the sufferer. She did not an
swer, but on reaching the corridor
grilled Rossi in the warmest language
she could command, telling him she
would take the child away before Sun
day came; that she had determined
that he should not see it, and that a
woman's will was mightier than the
decree of any court. Attaches of the
court expect to see Mrs. Rossi up for
contempt next week.
Decrees of divorce were granted yes
terday to Minnie Kleiner from John
Kleiner on the ground of cruelty; Viola
A. McGinn from Walter L. McGinn for
desertion, and Frederick L. Brown, on
hiE cross-complaint, from Mary Brown
on the ground of extreme cruelty.
Annie E. Ness, whose suit for divorce
from Henry V. Ness was thrown out
of court by Judge Graham Thursday
because he found that there was col
lusion between the litigants, has filed
another suit for divorce, hoping for
better luck this time. In the latest
suit she alleges that her husband beat
her and threatened her life. Suits for
divorce were also filed by Bessie Tyrrell
against Alfred Tyrrell for desertion,
Lizzie Horgan against James Horgan
for failure to provide, and Charles W.
Jones against Ada Jones for desertion.
CONSIDER GRAND JL*RY
REPORTS OX THEATERS
Commissioners of Works Maestrettl
and Eagan held a conference yester
day with City Architect Shea relative
to the action to be taken regarding
the theaters which do not comply with
the theater ordinance, according to
the reports of the Grand Jury's archi
tect. The reports on the Columbia,
Grand Opera-house, California, Tivoli,
Alhambr.i, Chutes, Central, Fischer's,
Orpheum. thr- two Chinese theaters
and Woodward's Pavilion were gone
over by the city officials named. It
was decided to formulate a request of
the proprietors of the theaters named
that the principal defects complained
of by the Grand Jury be remedied,
and. in fact, that as many of the rec
ommendations contained in the ex
pert's report be complied with in the
matter of complying with the law as
far as it is possible.
Commissioner Aigeliinger received
a letter from the Harbor Commission
ers stating that it would be impossible
to grant the request for a strip of
wharf room on Channel street, be
tween Fourth and Sixth, to form part
of a driveway. The letter states that
the plan would be detrimental 1o the
use of the wharf and cut off revenues
therefrom.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, MARCH 25. 1905.
FINDS A PEARL
IN THE MUSSEL
Theodore Fulton Has Piece
of Good Luck After Half
a Century of Misfortune
GEM IS WORTH $1000
Delighted Saloon Man Will I
Not Part With Treasure!
for Any Amount of Money |
More than half a century has rolltd
away since Theodore Fulton crossed
the plains in search of California gold,
but fortune never smiled upon him un
til yesterday to the best of his knowl
edge. The earth refused to disclose to
him her treasures, business enterprise
proved unsuccessful, speculations and
the green table left him poorer. His
appetite for mussels, however, has at
last brought him a piece of good luck.
For the last thirty-rive years Fulton
has been dispensing liquid refreshments
at the A. b. C. saloon on the corner
of Kearny and California streets. He
is a connoisseur when the subject of
edible gastropods is suggested. He has
a particular fondness for mussels and
the Belmont variety in particular. Yes
terday at noon he directed the "Chink "
tv prepare him a dish of the favorite
bivalves. His teeth struck something
hard in the first mussel he assailed.
Unwillingly he disgorged the toothsome
morsel and inspected it to see if the
animal had been feeding on cannon
balls.
A little sphere was removed from the
fiesh and after holding it to the light
Fulton broke the door down in getting
out to find an expert on precious
stones. The first Jeweler to whom he
showed the find declared it was a pearl
and offered $50 for it. The second jewel
er to look at the gem offered $500. The
third declared the pearl worth $1000.
Fulton would not sell it for a million.
He has ordered it put in a ring and will
wear it for luck. The gem is of the first
grade and is somewhat larger than the
ordinary sugar pea.
Fulton acquired some local fame
â thirty-five years ago, when he opened
the establishment in which he Is now
an employe. He had been working as
a bartender for Capitalist Thomas
Brennan. who then had a saloon on
the "coast." Fulton became angry at
his employer and opened the saloon
on Kearny and California streets. He
named it the "A. B. C." When asked
what the name signified, his invariable
reply was: "Those are the initials for
what bought this saloon â 'All Bren
nan's cash.' " Brennan said he guessed
Fulton was right about it.
WASHINGTON SCHOOL PLANS
SHOW HANDSOME BUILDING
Structure Will Contain Eighteen Class
rooms, Assembly Hall and
Cost $119,000.
The plans of the Washington Gram- ;
mar School to be built under 1 the bond ;
issue, to be submitted to the Board of
Education by the Board of Works to
day, show a handsome building of the
French renaissance style of architec
ture. The exterior of the first floor
will be of bluish gray sandstone and
the upper stories will be of Roman
brick. On the first floor will be the
assembly hall. There will be sixteen
classrooms, the second and third
stories each having eight rooms. The
top floor will be devoted to the gymna
sium.
There will also be a room for manual
training and another for domestic
sciences for girls. The roof will be of
slate and there will be as much of
steel construction as the funds avail
able will permit. The plumbing will
be of the most modern type and. there
will be a lunchroom with kitchen ad
joining, so warm lunches may be pre
pared for teachers. The building will
cost $119,000. President Roncovierl
said yesterday that it is proposed to
adopt only such plans for schoolhouses
as will place the assembly hall on the
first floor, that being deemed a wise
precaution in case of fire or panic.

SINGER OF SCOTCH HIGHLAND
SONGS. WHO GAVE AN ENTER
TAINING RECITAL LAST NIGHT.
Miss Jessie N. Maclachlan, the world- i
renowned Scottish prima donna, won/;
fresh and abundant laurels last night i
on her appearance at Lyric Hall bo- j
fore a crowd of delighted folk.
The manner of her interpretation of
the lousing "Blue Bonnets" created a
furor. Applause rang out and cheers
went up and the Scottish blood was
all astir and coursed rapidly as th>Â»
artist's voice gave forth the beautiful
strains. There were numerous other
cherished songs of Scotland given with
the same results.
John McLinden. the Scottish cellist,
is on the cello what Paderewski is with

good things mentioned there were bag

MRS. NORRINGTON AGAIN
IS ORDERED DEPORTED
Aged British Subject of Feeble Mind
Is Denied a Landing for the
Second Time.
Margaret Norrington, an aged
woman, who was denied a landing sev
eral weeks ago on her return from
Victoria, may be obliged to play the
wearisome role of shuttlecock for the
battledores of the immigrant officials.
The special board of inquiry yester
day decided that she was a British
subject and a pauper and that she
should be deported again to Victoria,
B. C. whence she came. She first came
into notice about a month ago, when
she arrived from Victoria 'on the
steamship Senator. On that occasion
she told the immigrant officials that
she had arrived about a month pre
viously from Dunedin, New Zealand, in
a ship called the May Queen, and that
she had been clandestinely landed at
this port in a small boat. She said
that she went to Victoria in search of
her sister; that she was found wan
dering about the streets late at night
and that the police gave her lodgings
until the next morning, when she was
deported to this city. The immigrant
officials started her to Victoria again,
again was she deported to this port
and now she has been ordered de
ported back to Victoria. She is 75
years old and feeble-minded. She tells
a contradictory story every time she is
examined.

the remark that he did not intend to
survive her very long. His sister, who
has been staying with him since his
bereavement, thought that his intense
grief would lessen in time, but now
she is almost certain that he commit

PARKER STEERS
INTO BREAKERS
Captain of San Jose Takes
Appeal to Supervising In
spector and Gets Rebuked
MUST STAY SUSPENDED:
Is Keelhauled for Running
His Ferry-Boat at Full
Speed During Dense Fog
Captain O. .W. Parker, master and
pilot of the Key route ferry steamer
San Jose, whose licence was suspended
for fifteen days by United States Ix>- i
cal Inspectors O. F. Bolles and John
K. Bulger, appealed from their decision
to Supervising Inspector John Ber
mingham. Captain Bermingham denied i
the appeal yesterday and backed up '
the action of the local inspectors in
a written opinion, from which the fol- j
lowing are extracts:
It appears from the testimony that at the I
time of the collision a denae fog prevailed on |
the bay between the Oakland shore and San
Francisco. The Alert left Pacific-street wharf.
San Francisco, at 8:30 a. m., bound tor Oak- ,
land Creek, running at hall-speed; about flf- i
teen minutes later she heard the fog signals
of a steamer, which proved to be the ferry
boat San Jose, about two points on her port
bow. The collision that ensued would doubt
less have been avoided had the Alert stopped
or given danger signals when she heard thÂ«
fog signals from the San Jcse.
The tugboat was steering about two points
across the course of the ferry steamers com
ing from the Oakland side, but she paid for
her temerity by having her stem started from
the wood ends by the frames of the guard
of the San Jose.
It also arpears from the testimony that
the ferry steamer San Jose was running at
full speed until a few seconds befoxe the col ,
lislon. when her engines were reversed by a
signal from the appellant, who was In no
way justified In running at full speed during
a dense fog while hearing fog signals from a
steamer which proved to be close at hand.
about one or two points on his starboard bow
Fortunately the collision did no damage to
hip steamer, but must have produced unnecea- ,
sary alarm among his passengers.
, Therefore the decision of the local board
in the case of the appellant. O. W. Parker, ;
must stand; and it is so ordered.

TAXPAYERS ARE
"GOOD THINGS"
Auditor Baehr declared yesterday
that many taxpayerÂ© are being mulcted
in large amounts In the matter of the
collection of their rebate taxes by a
concern which is acting without any
legal authority from the city. Baehr
says the concern has offices in the Cal
laghan building, and for some time
has been mailing postal cards to Aax
payers, so worded that those receiving
them are led into the belief that it is
acting in an official capacity. Baehr
says that such is not the case, for no
intermediate agents are necessary \G
get the return of the taxes under the
special levy of 1902 for schools and
hospitals under a special act of the
Legislature. The postal card notices
received by property owners are in the
following form:
i 1902. 1*Â».
Rebate Notice.
SAX FRANCISCO. California.
Call within five daya. with your tax bill
for the fiscal year 1902. and receive your re
bate. If you have loat your bill pleaÂ»e no
tify this office and duplicate will be obtained.
Office' hours, 9 a. m. to 5:30 p. m. and 7:30
: to 8:30 p. m. Rooms 427-428 Callaghan build
ing, corner Market and McAllister streets.
Vol Block Sub
The concern does not sign itself with
lta corporate or individual name, but
it Is said that I. L. Franklin, money
broker, who shaves salary warrants of
city employes, is behind the venture
which has already netted him thou
sands of dollars. The Call directed at
teintion to the scheme last Saturday,
but Baehr says that some taxpayers
continue to be gulled notwithstanding
l the warning. Others have informed
him that they were on the point of
dealing with the concern when they
read the warning and came personally
to the Auditor's office in the City Hall
!to arrange for the refund of their
, taxes.
One individual complained bitterly
! that he had turned over his tax bills
to the self-constituted agents, figuring
that he should receive $80 back. He
was handed $40, thus leaving a com
â  mission of 50 per cent for the go-be
tweens. Another man got $1 65 from
: the concern when he should have re
| ceived $3 20. The Auditor said:
1 hear constant complaints from taxpayers \
I who were mulcted In the minwr described. {
I The taxpayers should do their business with I
! me personally, for no one has any right to
I act for them. I understand that the concern
has been buying up the claims for two years
: on the plea that suit would be commenced
| for the return of the taxes. I would impress !
I on the taxpayer that all h* Is required to do
Is to present his tax bills for 1902-1903 at my
| office. A demand will be made out for the
' amount to bÂ« returned which will be approved I
, by the Board of Supervisors. Then the tax
; payer can collect his money without being
' put to one ceat of, expense.
It was learned that the concern had
' employed several men who had worked
| temporarily in the Assessor's office as
; field deputies to act as their agents
I in getting customers in order to lend
I color to the apparent official charac
ter of the transaction.
COURT SAYS WITNESS
COMMITTED PERJURY
I Charges J. L. Barrlnger With Swear
ing Falsely in Suit Brought
on Lease.
A charge of perjury faces J. L. Bar
ringer, until recently landlord at 121
Powell street. Barringer stoutly main
i tamed before Judge Hebbard yester
: day morning that he had not signed
a iease, by virtue of which he held
; the place at 121 Powell street, when
: to his surprise Judge Hebbard called
j upon him to sign his name in the pres
! ence of the court. Barringer did as
i directed and then Judge Hebbard com-
I pared the same with that on the lease.
"It takes no expert to see that you
! did sign this lease," said Judge Heb
! bard, "and it Is my opinion that you
; have committed perjury and should
be held responsible for your offense."
"I will see that the witness is prose
i cuted in the criminal courts for his
i act," said Attorney de La\ ?a.ga. repre
j senting Madison & Bui k-. who were
| suing for restitution of ihe premises
'at the address given. Burringer look
ed helpless, but said nothing.
Judge Hebbard then ordered that
; the hearing proceed and the plaintiff
established the fact that Barringer
; leased the premises in February last
i but had paid no rent for the uresent
I month. Judge Hebbard gave' judg
: ment in the real estate firms favor
Barringer's troubles, however, are not
at an end.

Rev. William Rader addressed busi
ness men in the assembly room of the

deeply impressed his listeners. To-day
