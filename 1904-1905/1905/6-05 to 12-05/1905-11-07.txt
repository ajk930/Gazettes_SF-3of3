DEMONSTRATION FOR SCHMITZ IS A TAME AFFAIR
SWIFT MURDER
AND A SUICIDE
END LONG HUNT
Milton Andrews, Accused of Many
Crimes, Slays Consort
and Himself.
Police Trap Pair of Fugitives
' Who Brutally Assaulted
Horseman, Ellis.
Pursued Couple Go to the Grave
Together When Faced |
Law Officers.
Tragic murder and suicide last night closed the career of
Milton Franklin Andrews and his consort, Xulda Petrie, charged
with the brutal attempt at murder and the robbery 'of J. William
Ellis, an Australian horseman, at Berkeley on October n.
With the police at his door aiid driven to bay, "Andrews,
thrice accused as a murderer, ended the pursuit that has crossed and
recrossed half the globe by killing his companion, a beauti
ful young French Canadian, and committing suicide last night in
rooms at 748 McAllister street, where the pair of fugitives had
l)een trapped.
In the realization that the long chase was at an end: that
stern agents of the law were ready to take him, at least, this re
markable criminal accepted the alternative of death, and closed a
career which has had few counterparts in the annals of crime.
CHARGED WITH MANY CRIMES.
With a price upon his head of more than $5000; with the
knowledge that the police of four States held warrants for his ar
rest ; with the desperation of a man hunted over land and sea for
more than a year, this fugitive from justice preferred death at his
own hands. And all of the evidence indicates that the Petrie
woman was his willing victim, for her body was found as if : she
had received her wicked partner's bullet of her own will.
Andrews and the woman were in hiding, fugitives, after the
desperate attack on and the robbery of William Ellis, an
Australian horseman, whom they had lured from the Antipodes by
offers of employment. Ellis, all unsuspecting, was murderously
assaulted while with the pair at luncheon on the afternoon of' O
ctober 11. His skull was fractured by heavy blows from a ham
per, and $500 in bills was taken by Andrews from him.
Andrews and the woman fled, and their trail was lost. Every
effort of the police was balked until yesterday. Ellis was
able after the attack to get away and notify the police.- As the
days went on he gave much detail of his acquaintance with An-
REVEALS -ANDREWS' IDENTITY.
This led to the uncovering of his murderous assailant's iden
tity as the man who was wanted at Colorado Springs for the hor
rible murder last year of Mrs. Bessie Bouton. Andrews kept
in hiding, but from the East day after day came more revelations.
Andrews was accused of the murder of Eugene Bosworth of New
Britain, Conn., and with the slaying of a woman of the half
*\'orld at Troy, N. Y. In all of these crimes the motive was rob-
Ijerji â the same foul purpose that characterized the assault upon
Ellis which led to the double tragedy last night.
; The police acted on information which led them to the Mc-
Allister-street lodging-house. A patrolman gained entrance to the

Francis .T. Heney Eeiterates
Charge That Boss Is a
Grafter and Says Prose
cutioii Will Be Pleasure
COWARDLY ATTACK
CALLS FOR ANSWER
Distinguished Attorney Re
views Unfortunate Affair
in Arizona, for Which He
Was Xot Even Indicted
While not desiring to be drawn Into a
controversy with Abraham Ruef, Francis
3. Heney last night gave out a state
ment to The Call in which he repeats
the charges he made publicly against
the Mayor's boss at the Mechanics* Pa
vlliou last Saturday night. Mr. Heney
also tells the facts in the shooting af
fray that resulted in the death of Dr.
Handy in Arizona. These facts were dis
torted by Ruef and in justice to Mr.
Heney his answer is given In. full.
The statement follows:
In the first place I am not now and never
have been an attorney lor or frnp^oyed by the
Citizen* 1 Alliance. I would unhesitatingly a<j
sjtft employment \u25a0to maintain or establish the
le^al rights of a labor union against organized
or unorganized capital and" would Just as nn
l.r.'.:ati:.K'J' accept employment, as I have, to
restrain a lauor union irom violating the laws
ot our country. : â¢
REITKRATES CHARGE.
I repeat my statements made at ths Me
chanlig' Pavilion. I personally know that
Abrahom Hue! is corrupt. Moreover his letter
|WtrtlÂ»bt4 in the Evening Poet is the best
kind or evidence that he does not hesitate
to adopt any cowardly method to accomplish
b:a viie purposes. No one knows better than
lie that the unfortunate tragedy In which I
participated and which resulted Ju the <Jca.tn
or Dr. J. C. Handy was witnessed by more
than tiity i>eople. It occurred at the noon
hour, immediately in Iront of the Courthouse
at Tucson, Ariz., Just as a United States
Cirand Jury &r.d a large number of witnesses
were emerging therefrom.
linen 1 )-, the' doctor was suing: his wife for
<2Horce and for the custody of their five
children. He had driven two other attorneys
In succeesion out of the case by threatening"
to kill tbem. Alter repeated refusals I finally
consented to take the case upon her represen
tation that she had appealed to every other
attorney In town and that no one else would
laHe it. Within two hours after I took the
cat* a delegation composed of five of the
leading citizens who were fellow members
w:th Dr. Handy of the . Masonic fraternity
â¢aid ot the Pioneer Society of Arizona came
to BJ7 offlce and Charles R. Drake (now of
lxÂ»s Anseles and president of the San Pedro
Water Ccmpany) acting as spokesman, urged
me to mire from the case and stated that
liar.dy had caid that he would kill me and
that they knew he would carry out his threat,
as he was a man of violent temper and had
already killed another maÂ» and was determined
and reckless. 1 said I would gtad'y retire If
they could agree to supply another attorney
to take my place and they paid they could
not do so. as he had threatened to kill any
attorney who represented her.
The case dragged another weary year, during
\u25a0which time I was frequently attacked by
Hanay in the presence ot witnesses and was
Lhrost daily threatened and abused by him.
He constantly carried both a six-Inch double
edged dagger and a ?lx-ehooter, and had thete
weapons on him at the time of the affray. He
assaulted me upen the street close to my office
In the immediate presence of a carpenter, who
\u25a0was putting a window In at my office, and of
icy Eiunueraj-her, a young man about 17 years
of age. He was a man over six feet in height,
weighing nearly 2(A) pounds, and possessing
lir-iat activity and strength. He seized me by
the throat, pressed me against the waJl, (truck
roe In the faoe. and then attempted to claep
me in his arms with the Intention of taking
rn> pistol from my pocket and killing me with
my own gun, as he had frequently told a
dozen of his intimate friend* that he would dfl.
XARROWLY ESCAPES DEATH.
They had repeated these threats to me' and
they afterward testified to tbem at the prelim
inary examination. I never left my olflee Or
xsy houfe during that entire year without the
expectation of being .killed, and I can assure
you that it is no pleasant experience. I '
just 129 pounds. I escaped death only
by the providence of a Just God.
\u25a0 At the preliminary examination, which fol
lowed shortly thereafter, the matter was fully
investigated and many eye witnesses' testifled
and I waÂ« honorably discharged on the ground
that I had acted in self-defense.
When the next Grand Jary met I was In !
another county trying law euits, but at my
earntÂ«t solicitation the matter was investigated
In niy absence and many eye witnesses to the
occurrence appeared before the Grand Jury and
it refuted to indict. I have never been indicted
or tried for the offense, and no man. woman
or chlla who llv<d In Arizona at the lime has
been cowardly or cruel enough to express any
doubt i.s 10 my entire Justification'
I am quite cure that Abraham Ruef know*
a: I these facts, and yet, to serve his own pur
poses, he has foully misrepresented them. You
must Know, therefore, hew much credence
ought to be given to his denial that he is cor
rupt or to any of the other statements made
by him. I do not intend, however,' to be
dragged into any personal controversy with
rim. My talk upon him on Saturday night
vas e-tirtly imptrreonal In the sense that ' I
was v twin* hia merely as a grafter, which he
undoubtedly Is. As Â«uch I denounced him and
as such, if an opportunity ever occurs it
would be my plttsure to prosecute him, not
as a \u25a0n;tno*s. but ai an attorney conducting
w# iXiitsf^^SeSSi^ community

SCHMITZ'S PARADE ASSURES
FUSION PARTY OF VICTOR Y
Much Heralded Procession of Wag^- Earners Only BOtjO
Strong, Barely Half of Whom Are^ Workihgmen.
The monster ratification parade of
workingmen, which was to have marched
through the streets of this city last
night in honor of Mayor .Schmitz and the
candidates of the Union 'Labor party,
proved to be a' great disappointment' to
the leaders \u25a0In the Ruef cause. ' It was,'
on the other hand, of the greatest en
couragement to John S. Partridge and
the other fusion candidates, for the mea
ger number of voters in the procession
proved to them that the victory was al
ready won for decent government and
that the wage earners of this city had
come to a realization of the sincerity
of the fusion principles and would sup
port theml
The parade that was to have been such
a monster in proportions turned out to
be a fiasco. There was by actual count
less than 8000 people who followed the
carriage of the' Mayor and the - great
black horse of \u25a0' P. Hi McCarthy. Of this
number fully 1500 ' were .boys, bearing
torches and. ..- noise makers. About
4000 were wage earners oT Saii Francisco
and they- were honestly enthusiastic.
The rest, about 2500, were representatives
of the tenderloin, whose very existence
depends upon the success of Mayor
Schmitz at the polls to-day and who' are
doomed to perish through the might of
decent public sentiment. They came In
automobiles and carriages, making a
great noise with tin horns and screaming
LOUIS IS GUEST
OF PRESIDENT
British Prince Accepts an
Informal Invitation to
Dine at the White House
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.-Honored by
the President by an informal Invitation
to luncheon at the White House, Rear
Admiral' Prince Louis of Battenberg kept
hla special train waiting three-quarters
of an hour this afternoon while the Pres
ident engaged him in a long personal con
versation.
In the morning Prince IVmis visited
Mount Vernon, making the trip. down the
Potomac River on the United States dis
patch boat Dolphin, commanded by Com
mander John Gibbons. On board the Dol
phin was a party of abput fifty, including
Rear Admirals Evans and Brpwnson,
Rear Admiral Capps, chief constructor
of the navy, and the commanding offi
cers of the British squadron. â¢ The Dol
phin got under way promptly at; .9
o'clock. At Mount Vernon the party was
met at the landing by the superintendent:
of the grounds, who conducted them
through the home of the. first President.
As they came to the tomb . each person
bared his head, while Prince (Louis* went
up to the sepulcher and : reverently stood
in silence for.' a few moments.) â¢ Upon
leaving Mount Vernon the Prince was pre ;
sented with an ivy plant, a sprout from
tbe plant which grows about the tomb of
Washington^..'
The Prince went first to the British
Embassy to take leave of the British
Embassador and Lady Durand, whose
guest he has been while In Washington,
and a few minutes later went to . the
.White House,'. where-he was the personal
guest of -"the President and" Mrs. Roose
velt .at an informal luncheon. .
Nothing <nas; pleased, the distinguished
visitor more .since his , arrival in \u25a0 this
country* than. the two hours and a half he
spent with the President and his .family
this afternoon.. The President is sending
to the King a. return personal message by
Admiral Prince Louis,' which will be: de
livered when the Prince next vieits Lon
don.
From the White House,.the Prince rode
to the station in, a n automobile, where he
was joined by - the : other,' British â¢. officers
and Rear Admirals Evans and'Brownsori,
and left on -a special train ifor "Annapolis.
Before his departure" \u25a0 for '.'."Annapolis
Prince Louis made a. statement in '.which
he expressed '_ his - appreciation of \u25a0\u25a0', the

that have been shown us by ' the I Presi

"stutters" has been exposed and
blocked by the fusion campaign com
mittee; \u25a0
Evidence of a widespread coloniza
tion of heelers ready to cast their bal
lots for Ruef has been collected. U-- *:>; .
Hundreds of complaints against Il
legally : registered men have been
sworn out and placed in the hands of
Deputy Sheriffs for service at the polls
to-day. Not a voter will cast his bal
lot in San Francisco who is on the list,
for a warrant of arrest will bo served
upon him as soon as he gives his name
to ' the Election Board.
For weeks secret service agents of
the Republican-Democratic committee
have been systematically at work un
covering - the vast network of fraud
and perjury which had been carefully
woven in the interests of Schmitz. So
hard were the Ruef followers pressed
that they -had taken chances in which
the fate of Wyman. Steftens and Reb
stock, doomed to convicts', stripes, was,'
forsooth, forgotten. The registration
rolls were filled -with names which
were placed there for the purpose of
voting them Illegally to-day, i Scores
upon scores of these phantom residents
were brought to light by the persistent
and unrelenting ; investigations made
by the campaign committee.
MUCH EVIDENCE OF FRAUD.
. Hundreds of agents of the fusion
forces, - under special, guidance of
trained ..experts, were -employed In this
labor.:- The result Is that a mass of In
criminating ' evidence Is in the hands
of the" men who- have conducted tlie
campaign against graft. * And these
men.purpose to make good use of this
evidence to-day. They have blocked
the attempt to capture, the election by
the dirtiest sort .of fraud., and they
have. v prepared .themselves - to "send
every v corrupt; '.'stuff er*Â«~ to | the;i State
penitentiary who. shows his head In a
polling booth to-day. . They have de
termined that, so far as they are con

as to" the Intentions "of .the mob that

the right of franchise.
.Under the direction of Perry H.
Newberry, assistant secretary of tha
Republican-Democratic, committee, 487
complaints charging that number of
"stuff ers" with . perjury have been
sworn out. In each case a warrant of
arrest ; has been issued. "With, th<Â»~
knowledge " that ; tha Police , Department,
through 'Jerry Dinan, its chief, Is con
trolled and owned by Abraham Ruef,
these warrants have been placed in the
hands of -the < Sheriff. >. His > force' will
take care of them to-day. . In the dis

has been done there will be at hand a
large ; force to serve the documents.
Not a man of the | 500 . listed :as a
"stutter" will be safe if \he shall go to
the polls. . The committee has expend
ed" thousands pf dollars In making a
breach in this fortress of fraud. That
the. work has not gone for naught Is
manifest from yesterday's disclosures.
MAKE CANVASS OF CITY.
f The campaign against the "stutters"
began early. A force of 250 . men was
sent out on a house-to-house canvass
of the,- city. The results were com
piled, district by. district; and compari
sons were made with the registrations
at the City Hall. '-. Many illegal- names
were; thus, discovered. Verifications
were made. Copies of the false affi
davits of registration were made. - The
records were supplemef.ted by affidav
its from special agents . of the commit
tee. This evidence was filed^and was
placed in safe deposit vaults.
v While the heavy registration was in
progress during September the committee
had a large staff employed -in checking
the , names ; against ' the -. house-to-house
canvass returns. \u25a0 : Every suspected name
was. closely, Investigated. Scores were
.found registered from vacant houses.
Many more wera traced to residences
where they,:, had} never, : been heard of
until the agent made inquiry. Many were
on the rolls I from t > corner lots, and so
went the exposure of fraud. AH this was
going" on under the eyes of the registra
tion officials,; but! it was not ,for them to
see. f Af ter * registration ' closed j the work
was confined to examining the transfers.
This ; w?nt on . until . October , 12, the date
when all ' transferring ceased for this
municipal .; election.

election of John S. Partridge and the en
tire Democratic-Republican ticket. He re
marked last, night, when asked to make
a forecast' of the result, that he never
had greater confidence in tha success of
any ticket than he has In that headed by
Partridge. Many other men who are
recognized as party leaders whose opin
ions in affairs of election are entitled to
consideration are convinced that the fu
sion nominees will win out to-day.
The sharpest kind of a lookout will be
maintained to prevent false voting, but
in spite of the utmost vigilance stuff ers
may attempt to Impersonate legally reg
istered voters. Should an elector on of
fering to vote be Informed that his name
has been 'voted, the course to pursue. Is
plain. -The voter should say to the elec
tion officers": "I have not voted, and I
demand that my vote be accepted. Let it
be sworn In. I am ready to be sworn."
No election officer has a right to refuse
a vote under such conditions. Some
years ago an inspector was sentenced to
the penitentiary for one year by Judge-
Sullivan for refusing to allow a properly
registered voter to rote.
ELECTRICIAN COMPLAINS.
Tells ot Persecutions by the City Hall
Graters.
Because he is not a member of the
administration gang, Charles L. Pryal,
an electrician at 416 Battery street, has
been persecuted by the gangsters.
Pryal haa been hindered from making
a livelihood by not standing? in with
the grafters. . He says the department
of electricity has withheld certain cer
tificates from > him,, which . should be
forthcoming when : an .electrician com
pletes certain work.
. Pryal related the following story
last night and says he Is going to
bring suit against the department of
electricity:
I -*aye been comDelled to roffÂ«r bisr los3eÂ»
simply because I am of opposite, political be
lief from those who conduct tha affairs of tha
department of electricity. In many instances
when I completed certain work and it wai
necessary to aecure a certificate, this depart
ment would send insDectors and find alleged
flaws In mv work and matte me so over It,
\u25a0Imply to persecute me.
I contracted to do* somÂ» electrical work for
3. G. KUlgore on his flats at ISII Jones
\u25a0treet. When I had comoleted the Job I no
tified the department of electricity and it sent
a man td inspect my work. Several times
he said my work was defective and compelled
me to make - alterations.
Mr KUlsore, finally becoming distrusted at
the delay, called at the department of elec
tricity \u25a0 to see what he could do la the mat
ter, j ' They told him I wu not a responsible
person,, though he was satisfied with my
work... He finally. concluded he could do noth
ing. " i '\u25a0\u25a0* â¢\u25a0\u25a0.-: \u0084 ,

ThÂ« duties of * thÂ« office, renarally. : ar* to

and an able, f earless and honest District At- .
torney will work aa much prevention aa pun-
ishment, for .the certainty of punishment is
tho-- surest \u25a0 means to prevent crime, &â¢ has
been notably demonstrated by the splendid
work of . Uovernor Folk of Missouri and Mr.
Jerome ot New York, who earned n&tfbaal
reputations as District Attorneys. . '
While the senera! duty ot our District At-
torneys is to purge this city of crime, it must
be borne in mind: ' .-\u25a0
First. . that ha appoints seven assistants,
four iot whom have entire charge of police
court prosecution; \u25a0 . ,
Second, he appoints four assistants who con-
trol' the issuance of , warrants and the Axing
Of ball, and who handle , over $3C0,000 yearly
In ball money;
-Third, he acts aa legal adviser to the Grand
Jury, the Police Department, the Health De-
partment and the Coroner;
Fourth/- it is his duty to draw all informa-
tions and Indictments;
' Fifth, in a word, it depends onÂ» his ability,
honesty and firmness, whether, crime * shall be
lessened in tbe city. ,
\u25a0 Inasmuch as the criminal law Is full of fine
points and criminal* are defended by . shrewd
! and - able counsel, no District Attorney can
I perform his duties rightly unless he has bad
1 a large experience in the (law. Mr. langdon'9
I experience is as a teachfcr. not as -a lawyer.
i Mr. Brandenstein has been for \u25a0 many years

record in the Board of dvperviaors has proven
I hla ability, courags and persistence In suc-
1 cessfuily.flsht'tg fraudulent schemes, no mat-.-
' ter ' how : rich .or , powerful their promoters.
We believe that . in all qualities necessary
f for the ' very \u25a0 Important office of District At-
torney,, the- administration of- which must de-
pend .on one man. Mr. Brandenstein -is pre-
\u25a0 eminently > fitted . and therefore earnestly rec-

room under watch, but the quest was not wholly successful, only
the woman being found.
BULLETS END FLIGHT.
For an instant the investigating officer was called out of the
apartment The woman quickly slammed and locked the door.
A moment later two shots were heard. The police shot off the
door lock, broke in and found the woman dead on a bed. A man's
body was lying on the floor. He had been hiding in a closet.
The identification of Andrews and his consort was made at once
by the peculiar marks on nis face and the large jeweled rings
each wore.
The corpses were evidence of guilt which even a long, ram
bling statement of denials, written by Andrews and found in the
woman's stocking, could not refute.
Policeman Fred Smith and M. V. Burke,
Â©n special duty in the Mission district,
trot Information two days ago that An
drews ar.d his woman consort were living
In seclusion, roomers in the house of
James Meagher at 74S McAllister street.
Policeman Burke shadowed the house
yesterday morning. Through a half
raised blind he saw the f'jrms of a man
and a woman, reflected by the sunlight;
moving about the room of the second
story. Burke hurried to the Mission Sta
tion, made his report to Captain Ander
son, ' and was sent to Captain Burnett.
Detectives Thomas Gibson and John
Freel. with Smith and Burke, were sent
to the house last night about 7 o'clock.
The game was well planned.
By agreement Burke was to enter the
house, and representing himself to be a
plumber was to seek permission to enter
the rooms supposed to be occupied by
Andrews and the woman. Detective Gib
son stationed himself in the rear of the
house on a roof looking into the kitchen
occupied by the couple. Detective Freel
and Policeman Smith took up their stand
In the hallway. Before the police en
tered the house the woman was seen to
peer from the blinds three times.
BURKE E.VTERS ROOM.
Burke after he had gained admission
made his purpose known to Landlord
Meagher. The two went to the room rent
ed by the woman. In response to a
knock, after some delay, the woman
opened the door. When Burke told her
that he was a plumber sent to refit the
g-as pipes, she protested that it was a
peculiar time of night to call on such an
errand. Overruling her protests Burke
went to work. Anxious to ascertain
wh<?th*>r the man wanted was in hiding
tinder the bed. Burke bravely kneeled to
the floor, pretending to measure the
tvidth of the room and satisfied himself
that thtre was no one there. The bed
was jammed up against a closet door
which was slightly ajar. The closet was
so dark that Burke could not see into it.
Meaghf-r called him to the door of the
room, saying. "I want a chandelier placed
here. Indicating the center of the hall
celling." Burke had no sooner stepped
over the eI!1 than with a bang the woman
Flammed the door, shut and locked it.
Xot wishing to make his intention known.
Burke walked to the window of the
kitchen and as he did bo Detective Gibson
covered him with his gun from his posi
tion on the roof, calling out. "who are
you?" Burke drew back his coat lapel
and flashed his light on his star. Then he
went eoftly to the door of the bedroom
and knocked gently. "What do you want,
now?" queried the voice of the woman.
"I want to finish my measurements,"
called Burke. "Well, you will have to
come in the morning," retorted the wom
an, "this is no time of night to be doing
euch worÂ».." V
POLICE HEAR SHOTS.
Burke, suspecting by this time that the
closet in the bedroom harbored the man
he was looking for, tried the door of the
room. As he did so two shots rang out
In quick succession. Burke drew his re
volver and shot the lock off the door.
The four policemen rushed into the room
and found Andrews lying dead with a
bullet hole througrh his head. The
woroan lay dead, half upon the bed and
half off. Death in each case was in
stantaneous.
The woman's position was one that
would suggest that ehe submitted lo be
ing murdered without a protest. Both
hands clasped across her lap, she sat on
the edge of the bed. while her lover fired
the leaden missile into her brain. As the
bullet rent her skull, she fell back in a
reposing position, her feet dangling upon
the floor. ' His one desire accomplished,
that the woman should not be prosecuted
after his death, Andrews seized a small
hand mirror and, holding It in his left

properties; for the color of

hand, shot himself by reflection through
the right temple. He dropped dead where
he stood, his feet stretching out beneath
the bed. *
When the policemen broke into the
room It was Just 7:5? p. m. They saw
the bed pulled back from the closet,
leaving a space through which Andrews
made his escape from the closet, ' where
he had been hiding while Burke was in
the room. A bundle of , the woman's
things hastily thrown into a small hand
netting spoke mutely of the intended de
parture from the house of the two.
Detectives Gibson and Freel positively
identified the dead man. Search of his
pockets revealed the large diamond ring
he was known to wfear, also the oval
shaped ring of a cluster of small^ dia
monas that the woman wore. In a 'purse
was found $130 in gold and an English
sovereign. An emblem of the Eagles'
Lodge and a gold watch and chain com
pleted the property found on Andrews.
The search of the woman's clothes re
vealed a bundle of closely written manu
script concealed In her right stocking.
The statement was an Ironical display
of criminal wit, in the substance of
which Andrews attempted to prove an
alibi for the blood-thirsty crimes that
have been attributed to his hand. .He
also tells of his movements and â¢ asso
ciations for the, period of several years.
In the room were found a bottle of
hair dye and some bleaching: solution
used by the woman. A bundle of dime
novels of the "Mother's Remorse" va
riety bore out the statement of An
drews in his manuscript that he some
times read cneap detective stories.
Nothing: else of importance was found.
DOUBT LANDLORD'S STORY.
Peculiarly enough, Meagher, the land
lord and his wife, claim that they never
saw Andrews enter the house, though
the police believe that he was a con
stant visitor. Detective Gibson be
lieves that Meagher is not telling the
truth when he says he never saw An
drews alive. The police are inclined to
believe that Meagher knows more than
he will tell. He will be taken to police
headquarters, so says Gibson, and close
ly questioned. Andrews, in his written
statement, says that he wants the po
lice to grant immunity to the people
who have been hiding him in case he
decides to surrender for the trials of
the three murders he is accused of
committing.
The four policemen who surrounded
the house last night are thankful that
one of their number was not killed by
Andrews. They knew the desperate
character of the criminal and had an
assault been made upon the room the
murderer would have undoubtedly
opened fire. Andrews knew by instinct
that Burke, when he entered the room,
was hunting him, but Burke had .but
a faint idea that the man he believed
was there was really in the room.
The woman, according to the state
ment of Meagher, came to his house
on the 13th of October and rented the
two rooms on the second floor from
his wife. ' She said that she was from
Sacramento and gave the name of Miss
Edna Little. Mrs. Meagher says that
the woman seldom left her room, but
lived a recluse. Both landlord and his
wife deny emphatically that they ever
saw Andrews or any man enter the
woman's room. Strange it is how the
murderer gained access to the rooms
of his consort yesterday, for he was
evidently In the rooms all day. It was I
In the morning that Policeman __ Burke 1
saw the two from his stand across the !
street. Meag'her and his wife live in I
the next room to the ones occupied by
Andrews and Nulda Petrie. yet they
solemnly aver that they did not hear
Andrews.
The police believe that Andrews may
have gained access to the house by
climbing from the porch of the ad- I
joining domicile. Hanging on-' an im
provised clothes-line just outside- of
the kitchen window was a white piece
of a woman's shirt, which it Is be
lieved was used as a signal by the
woman. Andrews may have had a
room In a house on Golden Gate 'ave
nue, the rear windows of which could
be plainly seen from the Meagher resi
dence. H&w Andrews could come and
go unseen is a mystery.
Mrs. Meagher finally admitted that
she was suspicious of the woman's ac- i
tions, but retained her suspicions. To a
groceryman on the corner near by, the ;
woman said that she was from the
East, taking in the sights of the West.
Deputy Coroner Brown took charge
of the remains and removed the corpses I
to the Morgue. . . I
HEAT UEIIKELEY HOUSE.; ->~^
The story of how Ellis met Andrews, j
also known as Brush, is highly. Interest- .
Ing. Ellis says that he first met the man,
at the National Sporting Club of Sydney, \u25a0
Australia, last spring. Andrews had]
worked as a trainer there. The two, with j
a woman whom Brush introduced ' as his j
wife, left Australia on the steamer Son- i
oma for San Francisco. They stopped at J
Honolulu for a time and ; then reached ;
this port. The first night here was spent
at the Occidental Hotel. This was on f

PAIR FEAR TO FACE
CHARGES OF CRIME
Milton Anrtrewn and Ills consort, .\ 11 1 tin I'etrle, ivbo had j fled after
brutally attacklns and robbing William Ellin, a horseman, at Berkeley,
whom they had lured from Australia, were found' dead last : night In
tbelr rooms at James Meagher's house nt 74S McAllister : street. The
police had surrounded the place. Andrews " was hidden" In a closet
when a policeman by subterfuge entered the room. ; \u25a0 j . .
Realizing that their hiding-place .was discovered, the young woman :
persuaded the policeman to leave the room. .She 'locked, the. door, and-
Immediately afterward two shots were heard In the . apartment. .The'
police broke In and saw the bodies of the fugitives with bullet boles In \u25a0
tbelr headji. Andrews' pistol was clutched in bis right hand .where- he
was lying on the floor." The 'woman rested on a bed as If in sleep. The
slgna werÂ«: of her voluntary acceptance of death at her lover's hands.
Andrews was charged with the mafdrr of Eugene Bosworth, nt New.
Britain, Conn., with' the slayer of n woman at Troy, X. V., and with the
killing of Bessie Bouton at Colorado Springs. He returned with Ellis
to this country last month, having selected the horseman'as another.;
victim for his remarkable record of crime. ' ; i !
alne, Oakland. Personal matters, were
discussed and Ellis accepted their Invita
tion to come out to the house.
Ellis said he had decided to accept their
proposition to go to , New York. Early
during the morning of October 11, Ellis
went to the Berkeley cottage, but found
no one there. Me returned to his hotel at
Oakland and found Andrews. The i pair
went back to Berkeley to the cottage. 1
Ellis continued: \u0084 . '
"I noticed -the woman seemed consider-,
abiy agitated. She did not make a re
ply to my comment on her appearance. . I
also mentioned she was .wearing no '< bo
dice. Being a trifle warm' I removed any
hat and coat andwent into' the dining
room, where, after .^consideraDle coaxing;
on their. part, I accepted -their invitation
to a light luncheon. \ ' ./ ,
STRUCK FROM BEHIND.
"I had just -seated. myself and; was
raising a spoonful of '\u25a0 marmalade to. my
mouth when I-. wajs, struck from; behind.
I fell off the chair. 111 1 was not entirely
unconscious " and got ' a 1 glance 'of Brush
(Andrews) . standing behind me .with" a
hammer in : 0110. hand .and. a dagger in the
other. I attempted to rise,' and. as "I j did
so .he struck^ me two more; blows./ -He
then put his hands' in my; hip pocketand
took five $100 . American bills -that I; had
with me. This scemedHo bring me tomy

MOBS RESUME RIOTING
IN THE CITY OF ODESSA
Troops Are Sent to \u25a0â¢ Quell Out
break in a Suburb.
I Shops Reopening and Streets
Being Cleared of Debris.
ODESSA, Nov. 6.â Fresh disorders were
reported at 5 o'clock this evening in the
suburb of Danliacielnitzi. Troops have;
been dispatched thither. The theater of
the town of Akkerman, near Odessa, is<
in fiarats.
â¢ It is now estimated that the killed and;
wounded during the recent riots here;
cumber 6000. The City Hospital alone j
[contains 2003 wounded. ;
Out of the 6000 casualties those who;
were killed cr died of wounds aggregated
up to midday 964. of which number 313
were taken to Jewish cemeteries and 651
to Christian cemeteries.
The Governor General has requested the
editors of all the local newspapers to re
frain from publishing accounts of the
happenings of last week, in order to avoid
inflaming the public. The editors acceded
to the Governor General's request. The
Odessa papers will appear to-morrow
afternoon after a nine days' suspension.
Anti-Semitic disturbances are reported
trom all the outlying districts. TÂ£e peas
ants are greatly excited and axe urged on
by agitators from Odessa.
Toe president of the Board of. trade
has telegraphed to the Minister of Fin
ance, requesting him to prolong the pay
ment of liabilities for cix months and to
order the State Bank not to shorten the
credit of merchants and to facilitate the
rediÃCounting of the bills of private banks
and banking houses. The President im
plores the Minister to send a quick an
swer, as a refusal will entail the great
est commercial distress.
Some of the banks and all tie shops
have reopened and the streets are being
cleared of debris.
It is claimed in some charters here that
estimate* higher than 2000 killed and 5000
\u25a0wounded are exaggerations.
REVOLT IX BESSARABIA.

Mnusliter of Jevr*.
.ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 6. â The
pews from the interior shows, that
there has been little improvement in
the situation. In BOine places disor
ders have been recommenced with re
fioubled fury. The horrible story of
massacre at Odessa is not fully known
here. In the Caucasus the Tartars and
Russians are cutting one another's
throats and the Armenians are giving
themselves up to pillage and incen

' From Bachmul, Bessarabia, comes
an entirely new tale of revolt. A three"
r- days' attack on the Jews was begun
"on Thursday, with every indication of
police organization. Jewish students
tvere " beaten, the Jewish stores in the
markets were sacked during the day
end during the night the plunder of
residences commenced. Troops ar
rived on the scene, but the following
Cay the work of pillage was resumed
before the eyes of the soldiers and po
lice. The prayers of the hunted Jews
for mercy were unavailing. Toward
noon the torch was applied ro stores
end houses. The police would not per
mit the Jews to light the fire and the
troops were withdrawn. Then the pil
lage began afresh. It was stopped
temporarily on Saturday morning
t through the efforts of the Russian
peasants, t>ut the police spread false
reports which aroused the mob and
there was a renewal of the work of
plunder and massacre. The losses are
said to be in the millions of dollars.
QUIET RESTORED IX FIXLAAD.
Polish Populace Revives the Lonp
Strustirle for Autonomy.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 7.â The ap
pointment of Count de Witte as presi
dent of the Council of Ministers is an-.
nounced by the Official Messenger this
t jnorning.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 6. â Finnish
and Russian flags were hoisted this
afternoon on the Russian station in
St. Petersburg. Train service will be
resumed to-morrow. Everything is
quiet In Finland and trade there has
been resumed.
News comes of a strong revival of
the struggle for autonomy in Poland.
Dispatches from Kalisch in Poland and
Thorn in West Prussia say that flags
\u25a0with the Polish coat-of-arms have been
hoisted on several churches and city
buildings.
The first train from Odessa since the
present disorders were begun arrived
to-day, after "having been thtrty days
on the way.
The Russ prints a resolution adopt
ed by the St. Petersburg organization
of the constitutional monarchists, de
claring for a programme of non-inter
ference with public demonstrations di
rected against the Emperor's person and
the orthodox -church in furtherance of
the demands for various liberties, but
of opposition to the Idea of a republic.

with the separation of the border prin
cipalities.
Considering the peaqe tactics decid
ed upon, the Russ regards General
Trepoff's action in compelling the
abandonment of yesterday's demonstra
tion as a colossal blunder. The paper
declares that the general's role not
only will not aid in the pacification of
the country, but threatens the destruc
tion of the dynasty itself. The paper
warns the Government that the troops
under the present circumstances .vill
not much longer do General Trepoff's
bidding. If bloody excesses continue
in the cities they will spread to the
country and Russia will undergo hor
rors worse than witnessed during the
Pugacheft rebellion in the days. of Em
press Catherine 11.
It is remarked that the reactionaries
are attempting to unhorse Count de Witte
on the ground that, instead of pacifying
the country, he has set it in flames. Al
though it is doubtless true that many
reactionaries would like to accomplish
Count de Witte's fall and a reversal of
his policy, they are neither bold enough
nor strong enough now to make an effort
to do so.
It is announced that Emperor Nicholas
and his family will shortly return to
the palace at St. Petersburg:. Count de
Witte to-day took up his quarters in a
wing of the palace, where he will be in
constant touch with his Majesty.
Progress in the formation of a cabinet
Is slow. Cabinet positions have been
offered to several notables, among whom
were Prince Eugrene Troubetskoy and M.
Koni. both of^whom declined \o accept,
the latter stanns that he was too old
to enter public life at such a critical
time.
Count VorontzoCf-Dashkoff, unable
longer to endure his failure to tranquillize
the Caucasus, is reported to have re
signed the vice-royalty. General Skallon,
Governor General of Warsaw, also is re
ported to have resigned. ; The position

OANNOT PLEAD
CAUSE OF JEWS
President Decides In
tercession With Czar
Would Fail.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 6. â President
Roosevelt has decided that no action can
be taken by this Government at present
which will be of any benefit" to the Jews
of Russia. This information was made
public at the White House to-day in the
following statement:
"Oscar Strauss called upon the' Presi
dent this morning, riot to ask him 'for ac
tion, but to consult 4 wit:h him' as to
whether there was. any possibility of ac
tion which would. result in a "cessation of
the horrors connected with the massacre
of tlje JÂ«>w<s in Russia. The President
stated that, of course, he .had/ been
watching with the deepest concern the
reports of these massacres; that he had
been appealed to within the last few
weeks to try to take some action not
only on behalf of the Jewn In Russia, but
in behalf of the Armenians, Poles arid
Finns. The result of the President's in
quiries coincide with statements con
tained in a cablegram from Count de
Witte to Jacob H. Schiff , shown the Presi
dent by Strauss, as follows:
" 'The Government is horrified at these
outrages. You know that I don't sympa
thize with such savage outbreaks. AH 1
can do to stop the disorders is done, but
as the country is in sucia an unsettled
state, the local authorities are often pow
erless.'
"In the condition of social disorders
which actually exists in Russia, the Pres
ident does not see that any* action can
be taken by this Government at present
which will be of any benefit to the unfor
tunate sufferers for whom we feel such
keen sympathy."
ASKS FOR SECRETARY'S VIEWS, j
Among the communications which
the President referred to in the fore
going statement, as seeking his inter
vention in behalf of the Jews in Russia,
.was, one from Simon Woif- of -this pity,
President of the Jewish Order, of B'nai
B'rith. Wolf has received urgent ap
peals from prominent .Jews throughout
the country and Europe to exert him
self- with the- authorities here to ee
cure some action by the American Gov
ernment that would tend to protect the
Jews of Russia from mobs. Among the
communications was one from Rabbi
B. L. Leventhal, of Philadelphia,, and
Wolf singled this out for a reply ex
pressive of his own vlews,aS'to ; ,the
power: of the United Status, Government
.in this matter. This letter in
he repeated to Secretary. ..Root in a'
short note dated about the "middle of
last week and in addition he asked the
Secretary if the statements he (Wolf)
had therein made were In. accord with
Root's own views. "Wolf also called
at the State Department to-day and
was :told by'Adee, Second Assistant
Secretary^, -that Secretary Root's answer
Â£6 his application was probably already
in the mails and would reach him, by
to-morrow, at the latest. Adee Indicated
clearly that the situation in Russia was
such^hat it appeared hopeless to expect

by this Government, .which.. expression

SAN LUIS OBISPO. Nov. 6.â The kind
hand of providence frustrated a fleridish
attempt to wreck a passenger train on
the Southern Pacific and hurl hundreds
of passengers Into eternity early this
morning, g The first section of train No.
9, north bound, consisting of two engines
and twelve Pullman sleepers, flying down
the "Race Track between Tangair and
Harlon, twelve miles north of Surf," struck
the Tangair bridge, which spans the, Los
Alamos Creek at a height of. 112, feet.
The bridge is 110 feet long. As the train
reached the center a loud explosion" was
heard, .followed by another. The . two
engines, were badly smashed and puj out
of commission,' the rails were spread and
the bridge torn-up for several feet. For
tunately the train was going at a rate of
sixty miles an hour and its momentum
pulled it over, the gap in the bridge made
by the explosion.
Dynamiters had been at work. They
had placed two sticks of dynamite be
tween the rails on the bridge. The des
peradoes must have worked rapidly, for
a freight train had crossed the bridge
half an hour before. While many cling
to the belief that the deed was the work
of professional train- robbers, others are .
of the opinion that _lt. was. done in a
-.spirit- of spite against the,Southern,Pa
cific Railroad Company.^ Had It" not been
for the speed at which the. train was
traveling it would have fallen through
the gap, the carriages would have been
completely wrecked the bridge and made
a death trap for the second and third
sections which were following and hun
dreds of persons would have been killed.
. George Harris controlled the first engine
and Joseph Bowser the second. As soon as
they, heard . the explosion they reversed
the brakes and the train was brbughtHo'
a standstill within a short, distance.' 1 The
shock awakened' the passengers from
their peaceful slumbers and a great com
motion ensued. 'Rear brakeman J Joseph
Bowers started off to flag the train, when
one of the passengers exclaimed:
"Aren't you afraid the. robbers will shoot
you?"
"Not a bit,'" was the cool response; j

Piteous Cry Goes Up
From Masses of
Unemployed.
LONDON, Nov. 6.â The desperate con
dition ; of the: poor of London .' was
brought to the, notice of Premier Bal
fpur to-day by a remarkable deputation
of the wives and other women rela
tives of ..the unemployed, who did 'not
hesitate to ; tell the Premier that I un
less something is. speedily clone to les
sen their' suffering there would be
bloodshed. ; : -;%* .
"Don't forget that hungry men are
desperate men,", said one of the speak
ers. All had the same tale to., tell of
husbands out of work and starving
wives and children. The pinched faces
and. tattered .clothing -Of the women,
some of them having babies in their
arms, bore eloquent testimony to the
truth 'of their complaints.'.
Enormous crowds of women from all
parts of London marched through the
streets headed by a deputation which
Balfour received at the office of, the
local' government, board. The "Mar
seillaise"..was .heard as the procession
advanced, perhaps .the first time It was
,ever.-hear.d under such /circumstances
in the streets of .London. .;
Only forty. ef;,tlie women were ad
mitted into ..the.. nresence of Balfour.
The Premier was very sympathetic. He
acknowledged, that the evil was very
real, but he had little to suggest in the
way of alleviation except an expression
of hope that public charity would come
to" the aid of .the unemployed. ..He
deprecated the socialistic suggestion
that industries should be started at the
national expense for the benefit of .the
unemployed as calculated to destroy
the springs of enterprise and energy of
the "nation. At the close of Balf our's
"speech, of despair," , as the delegates
described; lt/, M,rS. Cropks, w^fe <jf ,Will
iam Crbbkg',' a' jaljor , party .member of
the; House "pt . \Cpmnions,; and several
other wocqen excitedly invited Balfour
to come arid live among them for a few
months. The Premier remarked that
he was quite aware that nothing he
had said could be. other than disap
pointing. .They had his genuine sym-r
pathy- and he felt ..most acutely the
magnitude of the .evil from which they
were suffering. .
A mass rrieetirig of the women ! was
held; In' the I'aftef noon to hear the re
port of the^delegation. \ Mr' Cirdoks, M.
P.,' and others ; made .speeches: Crooks
said;, that Balfour's; reply to the dele-!
gatioh was unworthy of the Premier of

FAVORITES IN NEW YORK BETTING.
CLOSE. OF A HARD-FOUGHT CAMPAIGN
Tense Situation in Philadelphia Is Expected to Result in
Serious Disturbances at the Polls To-Day.
NEW YORK, Nov. 6.-An almost un
precedented degree of uncertainty re
rardlnar the rÂ«sult of the final conflict at
the polls to-morrow marks the close of
what has been In many respects the most
Interesting: political campaign ever waged
la the, city of New York. Whether Mc-
Clellan, Hearst or Ivins will be chosen
to rule the destinies of the metropolis for
the next four years presents a problem
which, in the face of conditions abso
lutely unique, baffles the skill of even the
most experienced forecasters of election
results. -*â¢-*% .:
This is due to the complications aris
ing from the appearance In fhe field of
a new and formidable element represent
ed by the Municipal Ownership League,
which, under the leadership of William
Randolph Hearst, has carried on a cam
paign marked by extraordinary vigor
*nd has developed a degree of strength
that has been the subject of general
amazement. The Hearst campaign cul
minated last night in a monster meeting
In Madison Square Garden, which was
marked by fen unparalleled display of en
thusiasm, supporters of the candidate to
the number of 20.000 being unable to gain
admission to the hall. Slmultaneously
another great meeting of almost equal
dimensions, held In the Hippodrome,
testified to the strength of the following
of Mayor McClellan.
To-night the managers of the three
mayoralty candidates declare themselves
to be absolutely assured of victory to
morrow.
TWO TO OVE OX McCLEIXAX.
Of betting on the result there has been
considerably less than In former years,
due apparently to the general feeling of
uncertainty and to the indications that
the result may be very close. In Wall
street this afternoon the odds ended at
2 to 1 on s McClellan, at which price
a prominent broker offered to wager
1100.000 to $50,000. The same broker placed
a bet of $25,000 to $10,000 on the Mayor.
Bets on Ivins ruled at 1 to â¬ and on
Hearst 2 to 5.
Odds on the election of Jerome were
about the same as on McClellan, and
many large sums were wagered by sup
porters of the District Attorney, whose
meteoric canvass has been one of the
mos=t spectacular features of the cam
paign.
John A. Henneberry, chairman of Jer
ome's campaign committee, issued a
statement to-night predicting the tri
umphant return of the candidate by a
sreatpr total number of votes than those
of all his opponents. Jerome made his
final speech of the campaign before a
great audience in Cooper Union to-night.
COLONIZATION" OF VOTERS.
Rumors of colonization on a large scale
and of Illegal registration have so far
playeJ a minor part in the campaign, but
to-night State Superintendent Morgan
issued a statement declaring that fraudu
lent schemes had been discovered of
greater magnitude than the records of his
office showe-d to have existed before, and
that he had taken radical steps to pre
vent Illegal voting. A large number of
warrants, greatly in excess of those at
first called for, Morgan said, had been
eÂ« cured and would be served by a newly
established "Secret Service" corps of his
own, composed of deputies unknown to
the other deputies of his force. A large
number of warrants were also placed in
the hands of the Police Department to
night. Morgan expects to arrest a large
number of repeaters, should they attempt
to vote. Most of the cases of illegai
registration, he said, were in the borough
of Manhattan, especially in the Sixth,
Eighth and Eighteenth Assembly dis
tricts.
The forecast for to-morrow Indicates
fine weather, Â»and a heavy early vote,
with prompt returns, is looked for.
REPUBLICAN* LEADER SLUGGED.
While the usual predictions of trouble
at the polls are made. Superintendent
Morgan and Police Commissioner McAdoo
announced to-night that the forces under
their respective commands were working
In perfect harmony, and that every pre
caution had been taken to protect the
ballot and guard against any disorders.
Charles Comlaky. a Republican leader
of the Second Assembly District, was as
saulted and left Insensible by a gang of
roughs this afternoon as he was leaving
the Criminal Court building, where he
had been to press charges against men
accused of illegal registration. He was
so badly Injured that he probably will be
confined to his home for several months.
Comlsky was with one of Superintendent
of Election Morgan's deputies, who says
that five men. committed the assault and
that he recognized three of them.
Attorney General Mayer will take an
active part In watching the election. He
will make an automobile tour of all the
police courts In Manhattan and the
Bronx during the day and confer with
his epeclal deputies, and be on hand to
give any assistance and advice -that may
be needed on questions involving the elec
tion laws and the rights of citizens.
JEROME EXPOSES A FRAUD.
District Attorney Jerome, at the final
rally of his supporters in Cooper Union
to-night, made a sensation when, on
reaching the platform he exhibited a
plate from which, he said, he had just
<Jiseo\-cred circulars were about to be
printed purporting to be Issued by the
nominators and containing directions for
voting for himself which. If followed,
would have Invalidated practically all the
ballots cast for him. This city, he said,
was to have been flooded to-night with
these circulars, but the plot was revealed
to him by a man employed In the print-
Ing shop in time to stop their Issue. The

PHILADELPHIA'S FATE IX DOUBT.
Bitter Car.ipalsrn end* With Both Fac
tion* Claiming Victory.
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 6.â The eve ot
the day toward, which Philadelphia has
been looking for six months: to .decide
whether the municipal affairs of the city
shall continue to be conducted as they
have been in the past, or a new order of
things shall obtain, finds the situation so
tense that no Phlladelphlan will be sur
prised to-morrow if the peace -of -the city
Is eeriously disturbed. Matters " reached
a critical stage to-day, when the Mayor
of the'eity and the Sheriff of the county,
both of whom are leaders of their respec
tive parties, issued antagonistic proclam
ations swearing to uphold the law and
protect the citizens against the illegal
ballots of the opposing side. The Sheriff,
in his proclamation, called upon citizens
to assist deputies appointed by him. to
uphold the law, and the Mayor replied
in a strongly worded proclamation, in
which he says:
"The peace of the city, the supremacy
of the law and the blood-bought rights of
honest elections must and shall be pre
served."
For the moment the question of major
ities has been lost sight of. Backing up
his proclamation, the Mayor has sworn
In about 1000 special policemen for elec
tion duty. The Sheriff says he will not
appoint deputies, and that the peace of
the city rests with the Mayor.
The proclamation of Sheriff Miles, who
Is the Republican leader of the Thir
teenth Ward and chairman of the City
committee, was published broadcast .In
Philadelphia to-day. As soon as MayoT
Weaver learned of it he consulted with
his advisers, and this morning he Issued
a proclamation which was as unusual as
the one drafted by the Sheriff. The
Mayor In his proclamation says:
It has become public knowledge that cer
tain conspirators against the public peace and
welfare are planning -unlawful acts In con
nection with the election to-morrow. Of this
criminal combination. James L>. Miles Is the
official head> and has ostensibly In his of flee
as Sheriff, by a so-called proclamation, an
nounced that be intends to appoint so-called
deputy sheriffs at the polling places of this
city.
I am Informed that the Sheriff of the county,
in bis capacity as leader of the lawless com
bination referred to, has been in consultation
with law-breakers and the enemies of law and
order for the purpose of devising some means
for the preventing of an honest and free ex
pression of the popular will at the election to
be held to-morrow. This object they hope to
eftect by having him, as Sheriff, commission
so-called deputies to perform services at the
polling places In defiance of the expressed pro
visions ot the law.
The Mayor, continuing, quotes the law
against such action on the part of the
Sheriff, and urges all citizens to resist in
every way possible all deputy sheriffs
who may In any way interfere with their
voting. The proclamation further de
clares that "the action of James L. Miles
constitutes such a menace to the public
peace that I deem it my duty as Mayor
of the city to proclaim that his lawless
announcement, ostensibly as. Sheriff, is
an election scheme, and that by reason
of this lawless purpose an - emergency
has arisen, and that therefore I,
John Weaver, Mayor of Philadelphia,
will, by virtue of the authority vested in
me by the laws of* the commonwealth,
take command of the police force of this
city, and In conjunction with Sheldon
Potter, director of the Department of
Public Safety, appoint as many special
patrolmen as I may deem advisable. In
addition to the regular police force, to
protect law-abiding citizens in the. exer
cise of their elective franchise and honest
election officers In the performance of
their duties." The proclamation, In con
cluding, says: .'^ .:V;
I lioreby warn any person from attempting
to exercise the functions or powers of deputy
sheriffs at the polls and I particularly and
especially warn James L.. Miles, Hlph Sheriff
Of the County of Philadelphia, prostituting his
high dfflce to the criminal purposes of the
political organization of which he Is chairman,
against appointing or commissioning any per
eoxi to act as deputy sheriff at the polls.
As all such persons appointed by him would
under such circumstances be law-breakers, they
ought to be and will be treated accordingly.
ThÂ«t peace of the city, the supremacy of : the
law and the blood-bought rights of honest
electors must and shall be preserved.
Subsequent to the Mayor's proclamation
Sheriff Miles issued a statement, saying:
I will not reply to the vicious attacks and
personal abuse of the Mayor, but I â¢ will say
no deputies have been appointed by me for
the election: that I will appoint none, and that
I have never eeriously considered such appoint
ments. â¢ â¢ ,
He said he did not consider the act pro
hibiting the appointment of .deputy
sheriffs for election purposes as con
stitutional and If he>. thought ' It ; proper
to do so he would have no hesitation* in
appointing deputies. He preferred.- Ge
eaid, to place the whole responsibility for
the preservation of the peace on the
Mayor, where it belongs.
' When Mayor Weaver was shown the
Sheriffs statement, he said the Sher
iff's proclamation certainly indicated
that he contemplated appointing depu
ties. He said he was willing to accept
the responsibility to keep the peace.
The work of swearing in special police
men was begun early in the day and was
still in progress at a late hour to-night.
Hundreds of men crowded the corridors
of the City Hall all day and 'evening,
waiting to be sworn^ In. It was the in
tention of the administration to have
only 500 extra men on duty, but there was
so many rumors in circulation that
squads of policemen would resign to-mor
row and Join the forces of the opposing
organization that the Mayor and his ad
visers deemed It best to be prepared for
any eventualities. Among "the regiment
of men sworn In are 350 students, of\ the
University oorf r Pennsylvania, some from
Swartmore College and several of the
medical colleges of this city. The stu
dents from Swartmore include nearly the
entire football team r ot that institution.
Among others sworn In are William T.
Jilden, a wealthy business man, who Is
chairman of the campaign committee' of
the City party, and Franklin S. Edmonds,
chairman -of the City party, city commit

The Republican organization and | the
City party managers have made every
arrangement to handle' all cases of ar
rest.
Great efforts are being made to bring
out the stay-at-home electors. \. >?: f
The managers of both sides gave out
predictions to-day that their candidates
would sweep the city. The Republicans
claim their ticket- will win by 50,000 ma
jority. The City party asserts that its
candidates, who have the indorsement of
the Democrats, Independent Democrat^,
Prohibitionists and the Lincoln party,
will carry the city by at least 60,000.

that cast at Presidential electionsâ ls

United States Senator Penrose and
Chairman Wesley R. Andrews of the Re
publican State committee say they look
for Republican victory in the city and
that J. Lee Plummer, Republican candi

delphia by more than 100,000. Their pre
diction is disputed by Democratic Nation

TOM JOHNSON* INDORSED.
Praised for Administration as Cleve
land's Mayor. '
CLEVELAND, Nov. 6.â The Mayoralty
campaign In this city has been of un
usual interest because of the precedent
which Mayor Johnson's possible re-elec
tion will establish. No other Mayor has
served for longer than two terms. John
son's opponent Is William H. Boyd. a
Republican.
The Municipal 1 Association, an organi
zation composed of prominent citizens,
whose purpose, is to investigate . the fit
ness of candidates for public 'office and
publish its findings,' lssued a bulletin, on
respective candidates for the Mayoralty
recently. Of Mayor Johnson's adminis
tration it said: V .X:
"The association has not heretofore
supported Mayor Johnson because It was
not at one time convinced of the sin
cerity of his expressed purpose to give
Cleveland a clean, progressive adminis
tration. His . administration has, how
ever, demonstrated the sincerity of his
statements. The - character, of service
rendered and . of officials, responsible for
this service has been placed upon a high
er plane than at any time In the his
tory of our city. His administration has
been business-like,, free from graft and
such as to give - our city a noteworthy
position compared with other municipali
ties in this country." .
HERRICK HARD PRESSED.
Vigorous Campaign Made Against Him
in Ohio.
COLUMBUS, 0., Nov. 6.â On the eve of
the elections the indications, point, to a
remarkably heavy vote. Successors to the
present Governor, Lieutenant Governor,
Attorney General, State Treasurer, Jus
tice of the Supremo. Court! and member
of the Board of Public Works, are to be
chosen, and also members of both houses
of the Legislature and officials of the
leading cities. .. -
The. campaign against the re-election of
Governor Herrick began months before
his renomlhatlon and has been carried on
so vigorously by the Anti-Saloon League
that many Sunday night sermons became
political â¢ addresses. - ; ; ; C ',
That there are defections from Her
rick, the Republican managers admit, but
they claim ' that . enough new \u25a0 adherents
have been secured almost to balance the
loss. Two years ago Myron T. Herrick
was elected Governor over Tom L. John
son by a plurality of 113,812, and last year
the plurality for President Roosevelt was
255,421, while Secretary of State Laylln
had 230,389 plurality. The full registration
figures this year are unknown, but In
nearly all sections of the State there was
a pronounced gain over the registration
of two years ago and very little short. of
the big figures of the Presidential year.
NEGRO SUFFRAGE THE ISSUES.
Democratic Party In Maryland Is Split
I In Twain. ,
BALTIMORE, Nov. 6.â Though the
campaign In Maryland practically
closed on Saturday night, so far as
public meetings were" concerned, the
leaders and party workers In the city
wards and In the counties spent a busy
day in giving the finishing touches to
the final argument for to-morrow's
battle. To-day's morning and after
noon papers were replete with fervid
addresses to voters, all beings devoted
to the proposed amendment to the con
stitution to bar Illiterate voters, par
ticularly negroes.
It Is agreed that the campaign over
the suffrage question has been Â©.ne of
the most exciting and'bltter In the his
tory of the State, the Democratic
party, especially in Baltimore, being
squarely divided into two factions.
The pro-amendment forces are led by
Senator Gorman, and the antis by Sen

ELLIS REJOICES OVER DEATH.
Australian Will See Andrews' Corpse
to Complete Identification.
BERKELEY. Nov. 6.â William C. El
lis, the Australian horseman who was
assaulted and nearly murdered by An r
drews In Berkeley, was informed of the^
death of his assailant to-night, and as
he listened to the story of the murder
and suicide his eyes lit up with a
gleam of joy. -After -.a few eager
questions 'as to the proofs found that
It was not a case of mistaken identity,
Ellis said:
Too bad too bad, that they got him dead
instead of alive, that he might have met a
fitting punishment for all that he ha 3 done.
During all this time that I have been ill from
the effects of his attempt to kill me I have
lived In I the hope of some day meeting him
once more. If we had met again he would
never' have had a second chance to kill; me,
and I ' would have punished him with my. own
hands for what he did to me and then tn*y
could have taken him and hanged him.
You can rest assured that I would never have
spoiled him for hanging, for in spite of my
hatred for % him I do not forget that he suc
ceeded In fixing others the way he attemptea
to fix me. Of course no man could forget all
his deceit and treachery, ending with a blow
on the head like the one he gave me. but
for all that I would not want it to be my
hand that ended his life.
After I determined to delay my return to
Australia I made up my mind that as soon
as I was well enough I would go to San
Francisco and locate that vegeterian restaurant
there and. watch it. for I was certain that An-
drews had : not left this part of the country
and I know that If he was in San Francisco
sooner or later he would go to that restaurant.
If there was any money or Jewelry in his
possession when he killed himself. I think I
shall claim enough to repay me what I loaned
to him and what he stole from me when he
tried to kill me. In all he owed me about
$1200." .
Andrews never spoke to ma of committing
'suicide 'If -he was â¢ caught in anything that
would mean a long term in prison, or death:
in fact I think that he was too cowardly, and
loved life ' too well to commit suicide, unless
all hope of escape was gone. But I do believe
that the woman who : was with him, either
asked, him to . kill . her or killed herself, ; for
one day when we were on the steamer. An
drews turned to her and said: . "I love her, and
she loves me, and if I were to tell ncr that
I waa going to kill her now, she would tell
me that she was\wllling.\ wouldn't you, dear?"

CHICAGO, Nov. - 6.â Conspiracy to se
cure large sums of money and to gain
control of the Western Life Indemnity
Company is charged against certain at
torneys interested in pending litigation
involving the indemnity- company and its
officials. .The charge Is made in an an
swer filed to-day in the United States
Circuit Court by the . management of the
companyrln the receivership proceedings
recently begun against the company.
"It is'charged that the accused attorneys
are paying the cost of the suit and that

mittee, is a part of the Tha
answer declares that the company is sol
vent and now has Mn \u25a0 its credit , balance
in the reserve â¢' f tnrtl > 51.035,315. But It is
admitted -that the assessments for the
mortuary fund are insufficient to meet
the death claims unless the reserve or
emergency fund .is used. There ; is now
a deficit in the mortuary fund of more
than 5357,767.
It is admitted that W. H. Gray had a
contract with the company and that Gen
eral Manager I. E. Rosenfeld later gained
control of It, but not by fraud. It Is

from the company, by fraud, but stated

bership of the Life Insurance Company
of Pennsylvania. As a result of this ex
penditure the Western company received
$90,037 over and above the purchase price.
It Is admitted, that General Manager
Rosenfeld and President George M. Moul

at Plan to 3lake Them

OBJECT TO INNOVATION
Tax Upon Energies of Col
lege Writers Is Resented
\u25a0 by the Youths on Staff
BERKELEVi Nov. 6. â The members I
of the staff of the Daily Californian,
the student paper of the Stale Univer
sity, are in revolt. Many assistants, j
who gather news of the college world
" for glory and the love of alma mater,
while they carry on their studies at
the big institution of learning, are pre
paring their resignations to hand to
the editor. The trouble has arisen out i
ol the new order of Editor L. D. i
Eohnett, issued to-day, revolutionizing '
the method of assigning the work to |
tUe assistants and making it necessary ;
for them to, perform many times more'
work than "heretofore. Unless Editor I
Boluiett recalls his orders the students ,
are liable to walk out in a. body and
leave the editor to get out his paper
without their aid.
' The "trouble' was precipitated to-day
at a meeting of the staff of the Cal
ifornian called by L. D. Bohnett. Here- |
tofore the assistants have been assign-,
ed for duty on certain days. of. the
week and have been required to. work
only on those days. Bohnett desiring I
to imitate the metropolitan papers, de- I
cided that he wanted a large staff on
hand at all times and issued orders di
recting that all the men connected with
the' paper be" compelled to be' on' duty
the entire weÂ«k. So,i nBtea -d of assign-
Ing work, to three orfour reporters, the
managing and news editors, under the
new system, would have a crowd of
twelve or fifteen students to handle.
The proposal of Editor Bohnett met
\u25a0with vigorous opposition. Ernest Voll
nier, exchange editor of the student
paper. led the dissenters. He declared
that the new rules worked Â«.ti unneces
sary hardship on the student reporters
'who worked without pay and. often |
\u25a0were compelled to sacrifice their
Btufliei for the paper. The point was
also made that the editor of the paper j
seldom appeared at the publication
office and that his work began and end
ed witn the writing of an editorial a
day. He divides up the profits of the
paper with the business manager at
the end of the term and \u25a0usually. draws
down <julte a tidy sum by. reason of his (
position. ,:...- â-*"/ -- ':'\u25a0\u25a0
'On the other hand, the recalcitrant
journalists claim the staff reporters' do
all the work on the daily, stay up near
ly all' the night preparing the news,
reading the proofs and seeing that the
paper gets safely on the press. They
do this all without pay and for the
little honor that goes with the -work
because of its ; being- r a "student
activity.".
Vollmer and the majorityjof the men
on the stair, feeling that Bohnetfs or
ders are entirely uncalled for and
arise out of air ambition to 1Â»e the Czar
of college journalism without regard
ing the hardship worked on the stu
dents, have prepared their resignations
and say they are ready to withdraw
from the paper unless the orders are
recalled. It is 1 possible that a meeting
of the directors of tie Californian Pub
lishing Company will be called for the
purpose of defining the powers of the
editor or the paper.

the men leave the alleyway- far the rear
Gf the store, and a. '"moment tater .heard
the first -explosion.? He did not" qonhect
the noiso with safe-crackers, "'however,
and paid little" attention to the strangers,
thinking they were -clerks about to open
the store."' The robbers, were also ' %een
in the alleyway by Miss Carrie Plant,'
who- resides in the Windsor Motel, but
she could give no description of the wen.
as she only saw them for a moment after
she had been awakened by the explosion.
The noise made "by the' burglars was
also heard by Joseph Martin and his
wife, who also live in the Windsor Hotel,
but they thought it was the fall of some
heavy object in the building and paid no
attention to it ,_'
'â¢ TIME OF EXPLOSIONS. . -
A twelve-pound sledge hammer, used by
the robbers In their work and found
later In the store, was identified as one
which had been stolen from the black
smith shop of Henry Ham pie, Broadway
and "Nineteenth street, which was broken
â¢into earlier in the evening.
As nearly as the time can be fixed
by "those who heard the explosions the
first â¢ charce of nitro-glycerine was fired
about 5:20 a. m.. and the second about
twenty minutes later. After making a
thorough investigation the detectives in
charge of the case declare the work to
be that of expert safe-crackers who' knew
Just what they wanted to do and just
how to do it. Detective George" Kyte
said this afternoon:
Vltr is the cleanest' Job that I have
seen since I have been in the business,
and 'the men who turned the trick were
old hands at the business. -It was a bo) a
robbery, but it is the . bold Crimes that
always succeed." ',
The exact amount . secured by 'â¢ the'
burglars was 5800 in cold, $173 in silver
and $45 In currency and three checks. The
latter are of no value . to . the crooks,- *as
they -cannot be passed. t
Robert Reed and John Shea,' who fit the
(description of the- robbers co far secured
| by the police, were arrested this morn
ing as they were leaving a barber shop.
where Shea ' had Jusf-Jiad his mustache
shaved off. As they were not able to give
a good account of themselves their names
were. placed on' the'* detinue book. It is,

Attack Is Made on Telegraph
: Avenue ;Within Few Yards
of J. A; Marshall's Home
BERKELEY, Nov. 6.â Dorothy Olsen. a
pretty domestic employed by J. A. Mar
shall, a capitalist of Berkeley, was at
tacked by an unknown man who followed
her : as she alighted from a- Telegraph
avenue car last night. at 9:30 o'clock. At
the corner of Stuartstreet she was forced
to make a desperate right for her safety.
i The stranger choked and beat the young
woman almost Into insensibility, ; releasing
his hold only â¢ when, by a lucky chance,
she was able " to | scream ' loud " enough to
attract- the attention' of 'a pedestrian in
the neighborhood. Then the fiend fled,
leaving his victim with clothing torn to
shreds,'" her body bruised, and" throat
showing the marks .of the fingers that
had clutched so tightly there.
' John G. Waller came jto Miss Olsen's
assistance and helped her into the Mar
shall residence at 2740 Telegraph avenue.
She was given medical attention and the
police were informed of the occurrence.
Miss Olsen says she observed a strange
man watching her covertly as they both
rode put. from Oakland last night on the
Telegraph line,: and her- suspicions of- his
intentions: were increased when the stran
ger stepped from the car an instant after
she had. alighted at the corner of Stuart
street and Telegraph avenue.-
Stepping close;. to her the strangeri said:
"I bellsve you are employed at Mr. Mar
shall's,, are -you not? May I walk with
you to the house?" . â¢ - , -â¢
.The girl hurried on after being thus ac
costed, making no reply, and at once she
found, herself in the grasp^of a powerful
man, whose hand, was at her throat,
choking her. into insensibility. . Miss Olsen
fought desperately,,. struggling to .free
herself,, and also trying; to attract the at
tention of ; any- "persons who .-might be In
the., neighborhood. . She ; could - not
though, because of the clutch " : of the
man's fingers., on,. her. .throat. .;. In the
struggle the young woman's clothing was
torn , and her body; bruised. 1
When the opportunity came to scream
Miss Olsen cried mightily and her cry
was heard by Mr. Waller. The sound of
footsteps frightened the man, in whose
grasp : the girl was held, and he fled at
opce.. - . - v > . ;
', Stlsa Olsen tells- the police- that the fel
low.'was .about' 30. years -old. smooth

vest, black derby hat; ' He was about five
feet . ten Inches In height, and weighed
about; 170 pounds! He is believed. to' be a
Berkeley ; manY" his knowledge â¢ of Miss
Olsen's situation being shown' by. his in

left the street car.' The police have thus

"LIGHT ETERNAL" GOOD
AS SCHOOLROOM PLAY
Majestic Audience Is
Pleased With
Production.
FOURTH ACT
IS STRONG
As a Whole, How
ever, the Work Is
Rather Weak.
After "The Sign of the Cross," there is
no particular reason for "The Light Eter
nal," last night presented at the Majestic
Theater. In its original form, the play
was written for the yearly dramatic
fiesta at Santa Clara College. "The
Light Eternal" had doubtless sufficient
ralson d'etre.
Revamped to suit the secular stage, it
is of uncertain appeal. The thing has
been done before and better done. It
has also been worse done. But with as
prelude "Mary of Magdala," "The Sign
of the Cross," "Ben Hur," and even the
spotlights of "Parsifal," the stage was
perhaps not crying for a "Light Eter
nal."
The author is Martin V. Merle, a Sanla
Clara College student, Introduced after
the complimentary thunders following the
fourth act as "just out of his teens."
But Mr. Merle has already behind him
three years of practical dramatic exper
ience as an actor. It is on this ground
that one is justified in expecting some
thing more of the play. A college youth,
simply, and the familiarity of the play's
material, ths> entire conventionality of
its treatment would not \u25a0 surprise. It
does in Mr. Merle, already author of a
distinguished little playlet, "The Prairie
Judgment," done some time ago at an
amateur matinee. ,
Quite conventional is the story. A noble
Roman, Marco Valerius, has secretly be
come a Christian. He has incurred the
enmity of Corvinus, Prefect of Rome. He
has won the love of Artemia, daughter
of the reigning Caesar, Diocletian, and a
kind of mixed Alda and Cleopatra. Cor
vinus betrays him to Artemia. Artemia
sentences him to the lions' den. He is
brought before Caesar. Caesar tempts
him to recant; with wealth and power.
Hand to heaven. Marco' will not. Caesar
orders him to be thrust to his knees be
foro the altar of Jupiter. "Thy will be
done," says Marco, and Jupiter's altar
tumbles about their ears, a liery cross
appearing in the sky. Great applause.
The lights play leading roles through
out the play. \u25a0 The calcium goes whither
Marco goes. The second curtain closes
with a Holy Grail effect on Artemia's
head, kissing the Christian's sword. The
third curtain ditto ditto upon the head
of Marco, defying the Romans. In fact,
"The Light Eternal"â is eternal light.
On the other hand, the fourth act, with
the bringing out of Diocletian, has grip,
climax and constructive power. The lines
throughout are dignified, sometimes very
effective, and Mr. Werle says things like
this occasionally, as Marco to Artemia, .
"And twenty queens shall be thy maids,"
which is a line to have written. .
The production itself is exceptionally
handsome: the acting neither exceptional
nor handsomeâ as a whole. ,Mr. Robert
Wayne strikes picturesque attitudes as
Marco and is convincing as his material
allows. John Ravold is a good Diocle
tian, Franklyn Underwood a good Sebas
tian, and. Miss Lillian O'Nell most things
it were best not to be as Artemia.
A large audience voted large enjoyment
in the play.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Alcazar.
"Why Smith Left Honfe." which be
gan a week at the Alcazar last night,
Is as funny as "What Happened to
Jones" and ! Charley's Aunt" condensed
into a single performance. The audi
ence forgot all about Schmitz, Partridge,
the Odesya massacres and pretty much
everything else but Smith and his ridicu
lous adventures. It was a night of mer
riment such as the little O'Farrell-; treet
theater has rarely seen. The laughs come
thirty to the minute from the time- the
curtain rises for th<* first time until it
Is explained "Why Smith Left Home."
If there was one part funnier than an
other it was that of Lavina Daly, played
by Nora Rosa. If ever an actress looked
"and sounded fresh from the "auld sod"
she is the one. Her antics were so ludi
crous that the audience by its laughter
stopped the progress of the comedy half
a dozen times! Next in line as a fun
maker was Adele Bclgarde, the beauti
ful. H. D. Byers and .Ruth Allen fur
nished half a dozen side-splitting situa
tions. Charles Waldron. Robert Ho
mans. John Maher, Lucia Moore and Le-
I nora Kirwln also contributed largely to
\u25a0 the success of the performance.
Central.
Judging by the immense size of the
audience and the tumult of applause
given the actors, the Central Theater
last evening certainly had a big winner
in the production of "Uncle Tom's
Cabin." The Central management has
a record for Javishness, but it eclipsed
itself last night. (The familiar story of
slavery days was cleverly- told by the
Central's company and of course Her
schel Mayall won a big triumph a.s
Uncle ' Tom. Edna Ellsmero was a
sweet "Eliza" and Little Baby Martinc
could not be excelled as "Little Eva."
Henry Shumer made a wicked I^egrec
and James Corrigan was an amusing
Lawyer Marks.
Matt B. Snyder sold off slaves as if
used to the task and George P. Web
ster and George O. Nicholls played
their roles as if they had lived in the
South all their lives. Clever work was
done by True Boardman, Claude Nel
*Â«>n, Charles Edler, while Lillian Elliot,
Clare Sinclare, Myrtle Selwyn, Lola
Henschliff and Diana Argall added to
the performance by artistic acting. The

tirety, the Central certainly has a big'
winner in this week's revival of "Uncle
Tom's Cabin."
Columbia.
Two facts prominent in the presenta
tion of "The Prince of Pilsen" at .the
Columbia last night proved that > the
management did not-make any mistake
when it announced this popular musi
cal comedy for a two weeks' run. One
fact was that there was- not a vacant
seat in the' house. : '\u25a0 The other, that
nearly every oriÂ« of the musical .num
bers encored again and again.
Certainly the presentation deserved the
success it achieved. There was a large
female chorus, with 'several. good
voices and a wealth of dazzling, cos
tumes and shapely nether limbs that
the costumes failed to cover at all
times. The male "chorus had \ good
voices. and was well trained. Of course,
the character of the comedy Is Hans
Wagner, whose personation by Jess
Dandy was much out of the usual line
of German burlesque and much more
natural. The tipsy. scene was irresist
ibly laughter-provoking and was reel
ing with originality... With, almost
equal honors'but not so taking a part,
James E. Rome, the funny Frenchman,
Fancois, was greeted. The cockney to
complete the trio of comedy stars was
an excellent personation by J. Hayden
Clarendon. Louise. Willis as the Widow
Crocker, Ruth Peebles as Edith Adams,
and Marie* Welsh as Nellie . Wagner
were encqred every " time' they sang.
The duet, "Message of the Violet," by
Ivar Anderson and Miss Peebles was
a gem of sentiment. The real Prince
Arthur Donaldson looked and played
the part to the satisfaction of the au
dience. - ...
California.
The Washington Society Girls gave a
better exhibition at the California Theater
last night than any of the other "spokes"
in the burlesque wheel that have revolved
in this direction.- The vaudeville on the
side was the best of the show. West and
Williams, comedians, gave something
very good. Most' of their jokes were ex
temporaneous. The minute they came on
they requested the audience to move into
one seat. They joked about the size of
the house, they joked about individual
members of the crowd and kept the gig
gles going continuously. Dave. Marion,
In his imitation of a man with a hair
lip and an impediment in his speech,
was screamingly funny.. Ah Ling P'ob," a
Celestial conjurer, produced a poultry
yard from his blouse-and did other tricks
that kept the crowd wondering. The
Washington Society Girls themselves are
not out to make Venus de Milo feel'jeal
ous, but most of them will pass under
the electric light.
Fiacher'n.
At Fischer's Theater last night there
was a hearty reminder of the merriest
night of the. popular house when, besides
snappy, bright vaudeville, there was a
return to musical satire: The work,' "The
Yacht Girl." by James C. Crawford, won
the big audience from the very start.
It 'served to introduce also^ some rattling
clever people, a chorus, the members of
which can dance, sing and act, and songs
of the latest and most approved.
. Miss Nellie Nichols in the. role of Miss
Gloria Grogan, the guardian of > her fa
ther, Dianyslu3 Grogan, has. enough vim
and dash for a, dozen soubrettes, and she
sings humorous songs in a. manner that
captivates. Miss Eunice Drake, besides
being a cultivated vocalist, Is a pleas
ing^actress, and did full justice to the
role of Miss Connie Cutwaten, daughter
of Commodore Cutwater, owner of the
yacht "Flora", and holder of the â¢ cup
for which a contest takes place. E.
, Coit Albertson has a, good voice and ex
cellent stage presence, and did well as
Percy Percival. - Theâ entire - production
I is cleverly staged by Frank B. Blair, the
1 scenery is good and the costumes pretty.
; "The Yacht Girl" Is $ure s tobe a draw
ing^card for many -nights.
Chutes.
"Princess Trixie," . the educated horse
that was the talk of the Portland.Expo
sition, made her first appearance at the
Chutes yesterday and proved that she
possesses almost human intelligence. Tho
feats that she performed must needs.be
seen to be appreciated: Bothwell Browne's
Gaiety Girls presented a new musical
comedietta, - "Mrs. Clancy's Wash Day,"
abounding In catchy music, and clever
dancing, and Eva Thatcher, an Irish
comedienne, and\the- La Telle Brothers,
European acrobats, proved excellent per
formers. Marie ' Straub, the pleasing
singer of 'illustrated : ballads. - and Del
phino and Delmora, the European novel
ty musical artists, repeated .their â¢hit*
of last week. The anlmatoscope, show
ing the latest novelties in moving pic
ture?, completed a capital programme.
Election bulletins will be announced from
the stage this afternoon and evening, the j
amateurs promise lots of surprises on |
Thursday night and there will be a cake- I
walk at the Chutes on Saturday even-
Ing after the regular' performance. ;\u25a0â¢.,:

DEALS A BLOW
TO FOOTBALL
Ju ry That '*: lnvestigates the
of Yoimg Player
Says Game Is Demoralizing
BLAME IS NOT ELXED
Faculty of Santa Clara Col
lege Decides at Meeting
to Do A^vay With the Sport
Special; Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, : Xov. 6â That the de
ceased, clarence Van Bokkrlen, came to
bis death tit the O'Connor Sanitarium
on Race street Saturday night from an
accident received while playins . foot
ball on November 4 at Santa Clara, and
we recommend that the trustees and
faculties 'of t lie public schools use their
efforts to discourage football playing,
which is both dangerous and demoral
izing iv its effects.
Such is the verdict of the jury that in
quired into the death of Clarence Van
Bokkelen, who died from injuries received
in the San Jose and Santa Clara High
School football game. â¢ The verdict dis
poses of the' rumors that there was a pre
concerted plan to.' cripple the Santa Clara
player. ' \u25a0 ' '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0',
A dozen witnesses were examined by
Coroner Kell and they all testified tnere
was no "unusual roughness and" that his
injuries were purely an accident."
Ernest Olson, a member of the San Jose
team, testified. that he tackled Van Bok
kelen just before he collapsed. Van Bok
kelen was running after the ball and
Olson ran out to tackle him. Olson's
shoulder struck Van Bokkelen on the
breast and he fell backward- and when
picked up was unconscious. Other testi
mony showed tfiat Van Bokkelen was
hurt in one of the first skirmishes of the
game.. It was evident that Van Bokkelen
received a slight fracture of the skull
in the first part and that the fall just
before the game closed aggravated the
Injury.
Dr. J.U. Hall testified the injury was
caused by a blow on the top of the head,
which niay have been received by Van
Bokkelen by butting against someone.
Harold Gallup, for the Santa Clara team,
said the game was a fair, clean one and
the team was satisfied the injury was
accidental. ... ..
Resolutions of sympathy for the Van
Bokkelen family were adopted by the
student bodies of both the San Jose and
Santa Clara high schools to-day and the
pupils of the "last named school will wear
mourning for .thirty days.
The game of football that was arranged
for Thursday between Santa Clara Col
lege and the University of -the Pacific
has. been called off by President Gleason
cf Santa Clara College. At a meeting of
the faculty of Santa Clara College to-day
it was determined to do away with foot
ball-until-it is possible to conscientious
ly, allow the children., who have been
confided to our care by loving parents,
to enter into it without such fearful dan
ger to life and linib.

BUNKERS' WIFE
OBTAINS BOND
Clerical Error. Voids Docu
ment- and Keeps Briber in

Surety Company Agrees to
Become Responsible for
Appearance of Ex-Senator
SACRAMENTO, Nor. 6. â Mrs. Harry
Bunkers, wife of the convicted ex-Sena
tor, arrived in Sacramento to-night with
a bond for hef husband's release. It was
issued in the sum of $10,000 by the Aetna
Indemnity Company of San Francisco.
Mrs. Bunkers went directly to the court
house, where she met Superior Judge E.
C. Hart, who had. sentenced her husband
to five years at San Quentin, and District
Attorney , Seymour, who had conducted
the prosecution. . An examination of the
bond disclosed the fact that It referred to
Bunkers -as having been sentenced to im
prisonment at Folsom, whereas he Â«was
sentenced. to San Quentin. ,
Judge Hart has always exercised cau
tion with j respect to correctness in j the
form of sureties, and he told Mrs. Bunk
ers that he considered the mistake was a
defect which should \u25a0 be remedied before
he accepted the bond. Otherwise the doc
ument seemed adequate. It was returned
to-night to the surety company for cor
rection and will be presented to the court
again to-morrow, when Bunkers will be
released. ; ; \u25a0 -â¢
The case of Bunkers on appes? was
argued before the Appellate Couvl last
week, and the bond will remain in force
pending the settlement of that motion for
a new trial, and possibly an appeal to the
Supreme Court. A decision is expected in
a few days from the Appellate Court.
Bunkers has been greatly reduced in
weight during his long confinement in, the
County Jail, and the release of. his for
mer colleague, ex-Senator. E. J. Emmons,
on bail last Saturday, encouraged his
wife to renewed efforts in his behalf. He
will leave for San Francisco as soon as
liberated to-morrow..

" THE MAYOR'S PROSPERITY.
THE only assault made by Mr. Ruef and the Mayor upon the
figures of Assessor Dodge is to denounce them \u25a0= as injurious to
the city. This is true. They are injurious, but they arc part
of the public records, and are true. The Mayor is the author of the
injury. It is surely a significant state of affairs when he is com
pelled to denounce^ as injurious to San Francisco, a condition for
which his administration is responsible.
He provoked the exposure of these conditions by boasting that
he had made San Francisco prosperous, and asking a vindication on
that account. An examination of the public" records proved that
this city has been far outrun in the percentage of increase in popula
tion, value of new buildings and property values by our two rivals,
Los Angeles and Seattle. In those cities there has been no class
government during the last four years. San Francisco has had
such government and as a result has dropped behind in her rate of
progress. If this city had gone ahead at the rate of Los Angeles
our property values would now be $976,700,000, instead of $524,
000,000; our new buildings in value would be about $30,000,000 in
stead of $16,000,000, and our population would be 684,000 instead of
450,000. '
A study of these figures shows what we have lost in four years
of government by Mr. Ruef, represented by the Mayor. Injurious
to the city? Of course It is. It is because Ruef and the Mayor have
injured San Francisco that the people have risen to shake them off.
It is because of the moral and material injury they have inflicted
upon us that both old parties have cordially combined to rid
the city of the incubus the}'- have put upon its progress. Assessor
Dodgeand the newspapers are not the authors of the injury by ex-"
posing it. The damage is the work of Mr. Ruef and the Mayor.
What progress we have made has been in spite of them, and is due
to the determined enterprise of our people, and their hope that the
rule of Ruef would finally come to an end.
The validity of that hope will be decided to-day. If the work
ingmen of the city would hayÂ« preferred to see $30,000,000 invested
in building this year instead of $16,000,000, because of the larger
investment in wages and materials, of which they would receive
the larger part, they will help the people lift the shadow of Ruef
from the progress of the city. If they would rather see an as
sessable property value of $976,700,000 than one of $524,000,000
only, meaning more public money for schools, street improvements,
park extensions and public buildings, all meaning more work and
wages, they will join in swelling the majority of Mr. John S. Par
tridge. As for the business men of San Francisco, no appeal to
them should be necessary. *
It is boasted by Mr. Ruef that he carries the votes. of the retail
clerks in his pocket. Why should the retail clerks vote to continue
Mr. Ruef in power? The permanence and profit of their employ
ment and their opportunity to become independent business men
depend upon an increase of the city's population, buildings and busi
ness. Who retards that increase injures the retail clerks and their
families and their prospects. If the retail clerks believe the Mayor
when he tells them that their employers are their enemies, and that
the proper way for a man to help himself is to hurt his enemy, then
they will vote for Ruef and injure their employers by helping fasten
hisgrip upon San Francisco, to hold her fast while she is passed by
her rivals in the race for commercial supremacy. Who holds a city
back is the enemy of all of its people, but most of all he is the enemy
of all its wage workers. Capital is mobile. It can pick its place
for investment, just as it has been picking out Los Angeles and
Seattle since Ruef ruled San Francisco. Labor is less mobile and
can take its pick less easily.
There are labor leaders who are wise in the economic laws that
â¢govern the prosperity of wage workers. These know that wage
workers require such conditions of city government as inspire the
confidence of investors of capital, for every such investment puts
money into the hands of labor. Labor gets the first dividend on the
investment of capital. The mechanics who built the Fairmont Hotel
on Xob Hill have received their dividends long ago. The owner, the
capitalist who built it, has not yet had a dollar of profit out of it.
Nothing can cheat labor out of its dividend from the investment of
capital, but the investor is at the mercy of many things, including
his fallibility of judgment.
We are satisfied that the wisest labor leaders join the wisest
business men of San Francisco in a desire to relieve this city of the
handicap of bad and grafting government. Let all such give up
their time to-day to persuasion of the voters to cast their ballots
to that end. - -^__ '\u25a0
McCarthy on heney.
IT is one of the humors of the campaign that last night's Ruef
parade, with its ranks swollen by men who marched under pen
alty of a fine if they did not, was led by P. H. McCarthy, who
on Sunday in Central Park denounced Mr. Francis J. Heney as an
enemy of "the people and unfit for any public trust ! President Roose
velt selected Mr. Heney for the most important public trust ever
imposed upon any man on this side of the continent, as special pros
ecutor of the most powerful ring of land grafters that ever worked
its game on the public domain.
It is the opinion of P. H. McCarthy, marshal of last night's
Ruef parade, that the President conferred this trust upon a man
utterly unfit for it. It was enough to make the bronze statues on
the old sand lot yell "Hurroo" when they heard it.
Mr. McCarthy is hyperzealous and superofficious now for
Mayor Schmitz, whom he denounced two years ago as unfit for
Mayor. His opinions of fitness and unfitness seem liable to wobble.
DON'T FORGET THE TICKET.
WHILE the fight for good government has centered upon the
office of Mayor, voters to-day should not forget the need of
an able and honest man in the office of District Attorney,
nor that a good Board of Supervisors is a necessary safeguard to
the public welfare. The members of the bar have, in wisdom and
unanimity, rallied to the support of Mr. Brandenstein for District
Attorney and have joined the people in commending him to the
voters. ,
The fusion candidates for the Board of Supervisors should be
all elected. Most of them have been tried in that office. The Call
supported a majority of them two years ago, regardless of partisan
ship, and its judgment has been ratified by their upright conduct in
office. We support them all now, confident that on their record they
will be preferred by the people and will justify that confidence.

PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC EYE.
DENMAN THOMPSON, the veteran
actor, was 72 years ; old the other
day. . He was filling an engage^
ment in Boston, and when he
reached the theater that evening his
dressing room furnished ample evidence
of the esteem in which he is? held by
theatergoers, as well as members of the
profession. Among the many tributes
which he received, one of the most strik
ing was a monster cake. The top of the
cake represented a rural scene with a
miniature cow, pasture, barnyard, etc.,
and around the edge were seventy-two
candles of various colors. Mr. Thompson
was much affected on entering his dress
ing room to see the tributes from his
friends and admirers. Then his charac
teristic humor broke forth as he surveyed
the cake and said: "I don't mind about
eating the candles, but 111 draw the line
on cake at my time of life."
King Alfonso of Spain, unless reports
do him injustice, on occasion acts like an

One evening the King slipped away from
the palace disguised as a laborer and at
tended a workman's ball, passed the
night dancing, drinking and flirting and
came back about daylight half intoxi

his alarmed mother he. told, her to mind
her own business and respect his author

mother continuing her protest he threat
ened to have her ejected from the palace.
Just then arrived his father confessor,
In whom he has great confidence, and his

MILLIONAIRE HAS A WIRELESS AUTO.
MAJOR WILLIAM R. WETMORE,
a millionaire resident of Allen
hurst. N. y J., and the oldest
member of the New York Yacht Club,
has contrived a scheme whereby he
can keep in direct communication with
h!s brokers in Wall street while he
tours the New Jersey roads in his au
tomobile, says the New York World.
A wireless telegraph instrument of
his own construction has been placed
in thetonneau of the car and a similar
instrument is in the railroad station
.it Allenhurst. There the station mas
ter, Fred Gerner, receives messages
by wire from New York and transmits
them by wireless to Major Wetmore.
It makes no difference where the
major is he can keep track of the rise
and fall of stocks in which he is in
terested. Station Master Gerner says
the instrument will transmit a distance
of twenty miles and it is seldom that
Major Wetmore ever goes farther than
this in his automobile.
Gerner says that there is no reason
In the world why every broker own
ing an automobile should not equip it
with this arrangement.
He keeps in constant communication

The possibilities of the wireless au
tomobile are so great that there is talk
of forming a company to manufacture
the instruments. The one in operation
at Allenhurst is simple and compact, yet
signals can be heard plainly for miles.
Young Gerner was of great assist
ance to Major Wetmore when he de
cided to try the experiment. Gerner is
an expert operator and his experience
made it possible to carry out the
scheme. While the major worked on
the batteries and colls Gerner rigged
up a receiver and transmitter.
The transmitter is as crude as it
could well" be: Two -pieces of board
are fastened together in the shape of a
cross and copper wires are strung
across these. The transmitter looks
more like a lacrosse bat than anything
else. The receiver is an ordinary tele
phone receiver. ' - â¢

telegraph operators. .. They understand
the Morse code, and the code used in
the navy. Conversation is kept up

apartment house. > The suite Is small and
their wants are not exacting and so the
young woman does her own work. Nat

all they need without any waste. More
especially is this admirable trait shown
when she buys her meats, her steaks be

The other night she had a personally
selected porterhouse steak .for dinner, and
it occurred to her to get out one of the
wedding presents for the occasion, a huge
carving set that had hitherto reposed In
its velvet lined case. She laid the broad
and shining blade of the knife across
the platter and then called her husband.
"Come, Henry,", she cried, "and test

Which was a oversight, he found, that

Fer firs' he fell across the chair, an*
then It fell o'er him.
An' then they rassled fer a while, but
my pa's chance seemed slim:
An' then the chair Jest bucked with him

We heard him go thump-thumpty
thump, with diff rent words than
prayers;
An' then they came a stillness there,
till ma, stuck out her head

seph, is he dead?
Oh, tell me, is the burglar killed?" At
firs' they was a cam, \u25a0â¢ ,
An* then we heerd pa feebly groan, "No.
dern it â but I am!"
We gathered up pa an' his groans an'
them to bed we fetched;
We gathered up his nightshirt, too,
that there chair had ketched, -
An' then we called a doctor in to set
his bones an' things,
An* when my pa had convalesced his
arms was both in slings.
An* then one day he says ter me: "I

FABLE OF THE TRANSLATED TWO.
Once upon .a time there was a young
man who was knock-kneed and bow
legged, and his eyebrows and his hair
grew so closely together that nobody
could distinguish more than a line be
tween them, and his features resembled a
blur, and even his friends admitted that
he - would draw a valuable prize in a
homely men's contest.
And at the same time there dwelt
upon the earth. a maiden who also was â
but no, I cannot say that she was knock
kneed, for how should I know?â but she
certainly was not handsome, and
face frequently stopped the kitchen clock,
although just one sight of her freckles
set it to going again. In short, she was
one of these girls of whom their friends
say, "She is so good."
Now It chanced that In their wandering
these two cafce upon each other.
And, behold! a miracle.
For the maiden was fair and beautiful
in the eyes of the young man, and in her
eyes he was noble and good to look
upon.
So it came to pass that they joined
hands and walked together, and although
this was long ago, each still is glorified
unto the vision of the other.
Moral: It is Love, and Love alone,
that can work this miracle of miracles,
and he still performs it, so that if you
keep your eyes open you shall see it
somewhere about you every day.

Edna Wallace Hopper Sued
for Alleged Breach of
Promise to Marry by
Actor James G. Morton
LEAP YEAR JOKE
GETS INTO COURT
California Young Woman
Says She Was Not in Earn
est When She "Popped the
Question" to Her Friend
Special Dispatch to The Call
BUFFALO. N. V., Nov. 6.â Edna Wal
lece Hopper is defendant in an action
brought by James Q. Morton for dam
ages for breach of an alleged promise
to marry him. Papers in the lawsuit
were served upon Miss Hopper upon
her arrival in 'Buffalo to-day and also
have been filed in the office of the
county clerk, this being: necessary by
reason of the fact that the plaintiff
iioeÂ» not reside In the State. Morton
U a well-known actor, but his stage
liame does not appear in the papers
aor in any address given.
The complainant in the action de
clares that It -was Miss Hopper who
proposed marriage to Morton and that
the question was popped toward the
close of last year â leap year â in New
York City. Morton avers that Miss
Hopper and he had been very Intimate
rriends for many months and that she
frequently asked him why he never
married.
"Can't get any one 10 have me," he
s.'yj! -was his answer.
"I'd have you in a minute if I
thought your case was not hopeless."
he says was the way she met the situa
tion.
"The case wouldn't be hopeless if you
asked me in the right spirit," Morton
told her and thereupon she figurative
ly wont down upon her knees to him
and asked him to' marry her. He says
he accepted on the spot and that for a
fÂ«nsiderable time she treated the mat
tor as seriously as he did; that at one
time the day for their wedding was set
and-that she then asked for and obtain
ed a postponement, and that later she
told him the wholf thing was a joke
and has since refused to carry out her
agreement. Xow he asks for $50,000.
Miss Hopper was seen at her dress
ing room at the Lyceum Theater this
afternoon and was asked if she cared
to make a statement with reference to
Morton's suit.
"I don't think he is any more In
earnest now than he was when we had
that little talk of which he speaks in
this complaint,*; eaid Miss Hopper, as
6he pointed to the document lying on
her dressing table. "He knew at that
time the matter \ras only a joke; he
);nows so notr, but he insists upon
treating it seriously."
"Do you like him?" the actress was
"Like him? Certainly. He is one of
the b<\=t fellows I ever met, but marry
ing' him is quite another thing, you
know. I had one matrimonial experi
ence and that is quite enough for me."
Miss Hopper added that slic intended
consulting her own attorney in New
York with reference to the defense of
the action.

did me absolutely no good whatsoever.
I endured this condition for 7 years.
"In January (1904) a friend told me
that for several years prior to 1900 she
had suffered much as I appeared to be
suffering, and that the cause of it was
improper food. That when she reached
this conclusion she began the syste-

"My mind became clear and active,

"My digestion has been completely

MURPHY'S UNWISE QUESTION

rrom lestiiymp*.
Eleven matrons residing on the first
block of Federal street were in Police
Judge Mogan's court and ready to testify
that Mrs. Jane Curran was a most un
desirable neighbor, inasmuch as she
drank to excess and fractured the peace,
but only one of them, Mrs. Mary Murphy,
had been called to testify when
an Incident occurred that precluded neces
sity of (fclinching the prosecution by call
ing any of the others.
The defendant's husband, Thomas, at
tired in his Sunday raiment, was among
those present, and while Mrs. Murphy
was narrating her grievance he rose
from his seat and in a loud voice ejacu
lated:
"What in the hot place is this double
dashed talk about, anyway?"
"Arrest that man!" the Judge conl
manded, and Bailiff Mahoney promptly
obeyed by springing with remarkable
agility to Mr. Curran's side, grasping the
collar of his Prince Albert coat and haul
ing him to the dais. Mr. Curran did not
submissively accent capture, howeve*. !
nor was his apearance improved by the
rough handling provoked by his resist
ance.
"What do you mean by such conduct ii
court? " his Honor thundered, glaring at
the disheveled prisoner.
"I only asked a ques "
"You're drunk and in contempt, the
bench interrupted, "and I'll sentence you
Wednesday."
While the bailiff was removing Mr.
Curran an attorney for the defense of
Mrs. Curran started to say something,
but the Judge told him that enough testi
mony had been heard to satisfy him of
the woman's guilt.
"I'll sentence her Wednesday, too," was
the final order.
Mrs. Curran's lady neighbors then re
tired to the corridor, where they made
up for their deprivation of a hearing
in court by telling each other and various
curious outsiders what they would have
stated under oath. Among the allega
tions they unanimously had been pre
pared to utter was one to the effect that
Mrs. Curran, while in her cups, had
pelted them with rocks and their children
with sand; also that prior to her terror
izing of Federal street she was ousted
from a certain block on Clementina street
by well-behaved residents thereon who
had found her disorderlness of character
simply unendurable.
Patrolman McMurray could not tell
Judge Cabanlss how the row began. All
he knew ot its origin was contained in
the Information conveyed to him that a
Russian wedding party was in progress at
1217 Howard street and that those present
were having "a rough house." Hasten
ing to the scene of disturbance he found
the three defendantsâ registered as Peter
Thomas, Frank Thomas and Frank Marks
â engaged in oral and fistic debate on
the sidewalk, while the door and steps
leading thereto were thronged with swart
sklnned men and women who Jabbered
unintelligibly and with great loudness,
their utterances being largely composed
of "ski"' and "vltch." He arrested the
trio.
"Of course," said the Judge to the de
fendants, "you did not give your proper
names to the booking sergeant, but I
don't think he regrets the saving of Ink
effected by the writing of your assumed
cognomens. However, your incarcera
tion since Saturday nightâ to say nothing
of the physical damage you Inflicted on
each otherâ seems to me to have suffi
ciently, expiated your peace disturbance."

Nelson Wood, a teamster, was accused
of burglary by C. F. Martin, president of
the Pacific Milling and Holding Company,
who informed Judge Mogan that the de
fendant feloniously entered the corpora
tion's yard, on Fifth street, and drove
away with a quantity of lumber.
On behalf of the defense It vras claimed
that Wood had been in the habit of ob
taining lumber from the complainant's
yard for a builder by whom he was oc
casionally employed, and that at the
time of the alleged burglary he merely
did what he frequently had done before,'
and that he ceased loading his wagon as
soon as he was commanded to do so. '
Then it was hinted to Judge Mogan
that the charge really was provoked by
some trouble which had abruptly frac
tured the friendship existing between the
complainant and the defendant's employ
er. Case dismissed.
"William Daly was escorting a young
woman homeward last Saturday â¢ night,

to engage in active combat with him.
Percy L. Simons, a companion of Kelly,
rushed into the fight and was exchanging
blow's with Daly when Patrolman Prell
arrested both of them for peace dis
turbance.
Judge Mogan dismissed Daly and pro
nounced Simons guilty, and the" pro
nouncement was supplemented with a
homily on the indiscretion of "butting
in."Â» . : .\u25a0;\u25a0;.\u25a0 . ' .'"\u25a0

colm at 3 o'clock Sunday morning, and
Investigation led to their discovery of
. Thomas Moran, stretched full length
j upon a horizontal tomb and sound
asleep, while a fire of faggots
1 twinkled and crackled neat*, his feet.
They aroused him from slumber and
tasked him why on earth he had chosen
such an uninviting spot as a camping
place, and In a thick tone he told them
that he did not know. The same plea of
Ignorance he repeated to Judge Mogan.
"I musta ben drunk when I went into
the graveyard," he said, "for I don't re
member nothin' about how I got .in."
"But the fireâ what about that?" his
Honor inquired.
"I musta lit th' fire t' keep my feet
warm," was the reply.
Having satisfied himself that Mr. Moran
was not a vagrant, .but an industrious
laborer and paterfamilias, the Judge
asked him if he had ever been a soldier
or a hunter.
"Both," wus the answer.
"Then," sagely quoth his Honor, "that,
fact may be. explanatory of the fire. In
your inebriety, I conjecture, you imag
ined you were on the march or engaged
In the chase, and you camped for the
n ght as you often had done before.
Eh?"
"I wouldn't wonder if you ain't right,"
Mr. Moran murmured, reflectively.
"Well, go home, and choose some other
spot than a grave for your next camping
place."

Rev. if. Kozaki Praises His
Countrymen Above Many of
the En ropean "Immigrants
Japanese thrift, and opulence on the Pa
cific Coast. were revealed -yesterday at a
meeting of, the Congregational Ministers'
Union, by the Rev. H. Kozaki, the foun
der of the Congregational church In Tokio,
and president of the, Congregational The
ological College in Japan.
Mr. Ko:.aki showed that on the Pacific
Coast are men of his nation who have
grown \o be millionaires through indom
itable pluck, perseverance and; energy on
their farms. And, furthermore, ho dem
onstrated by his statistics that fanning
is not the bankrupting calling which
some Imagine.
The noted Japanese minister stated that
here on the coast are no less than 60,000
Japanese, and in enumerating the voca
tions he surprised his audience when he
told of the Pierpont Morgans among them
who could write their check for a million
accumulated through tilling and cultivat
ing the fertile soil and diligently follow
ing the farmer's life in its every phase.
There are Japanese following commer
cial pursuits on the coast who are worth
anywheje.up to $100,000. .Then there are
the artisans among them, who are en
gaged in rai*v, r ay construction, ; and a
number of the student class s who arc
earning their livelihood^ doing, household
| work.
Â» While r.ome, he said, return to thetr na
tive land, there are many who remain Â»n
the United States. Mr. Kozaki declares
that they make better citizens than many
immigrants who come from Ciiropo.
â¢The Methodists had been doing mission
ary work on the coast for the last twenty
flve years, he said, and have in the field
twelve missions and ten Japanese minis
ter,*. The Methodists South came later.
The Prtssbyterians have five mis.-sion-s ami
seven preachers; the Baptlst3 three mis
sions and two preachers; the Congrcga
tfonalists seven missions.
Other denominations, the Episcopalians,
the Christian body, and Friand3, he
pointed out, are following up the work,
while the Buddhists are showing great
activity with ten .missions.
It v.as announced yesterday that the.
plan cf th' American Board of Commis
sioners for Foreign Missions to raise

This is to celebrate the contennlal of

ASSERTS. THAT BANK
..\u25a0 DEFRAUDED COMPANY
Mining- Corporation Sues the
.American National for
Big Damages.
Barton Pittman, trustee of the Bullfrog
Syndicate Mines Company, filed suit yes
terday against the American National
Bank of San -Francisco to recover $100,000
damages which, he asserts, the company
he controls has suffered through Irregular
acts of the defendant corporation. He
first asks that an accounting be had and
that at its conclusion he be awarded
what damages the court. may hold he is
entitled to, though he asperts that a
reasonable' figure would be, as stated,
$100,000.
As his chief cause* of action Pittman
alleges that the defendant bank has ap
propriated moneys sent it as subscrip
tions for stock In mines held by the Bull
frog Syndicate Mines Company and used
information secured by it in its capacity
as agent of the plaintiff corporation to
further the interests of; other mines $ln
which the bank was directly interested,
influencing people that intended to invest
their money In stock of the plaintiff min
ing company to speculate on other prop
erties.
Two years ago; Plttman alleges In the
complaint, the American' National Bank
entered into an agreement' with the
plaintiff mining company by the terms of
.which the bank was ,to act as the de
pository to receive all moneys of the com
pany and deliver to Pittman an account
of all malls and inquiries received |by
it in reference to the mines of the plain
tiff. Pittman asserts that in furtherance
of the purpose of . this agreement : 23,000
circulars were distributed throughout the
country, the . circulars stating that full
information could be had of the American
National. Bank and that it : had . been
authorized^ to receive subscriptions.
\u25a0 -Instead, of keeping its agreement, how
ever, Pittman alleges that the bank.ad
vised those that Inquired regarding the
properties of the Bullfrog Syndicate that
it would be to their best interests to in
vest their funds in properties in which the
bank ha% pecuniary interest, and also
that the bank "wrongfully, knowingly
and with intent to defraud the plaintiff
and with intent to ignore its duties as
trustee. of the plaintiff, appropriated large
sums of money to its own use." .' ''

New Version of
An_o Id Adage
Do You Eat for Mere Stimulation or
Tor Real Nutrition?
"In matters of money there Is an old
adage that says, "It Is not so much
what you earn as what you save," and
Just so, in the question of food anct
health, it might be said as truly, "It's
not so much what you eat as what real
nourishment you get out of what you
eat." :\u25a0\u25a0/, . ,
-This is the secret of health, strength
and vitality.' No difference how much
nutrition your food contains, if your
system doos not assimilate that nutrl-.
tion â take It up and distribute It
throughout your body â you gain noth-
ing beyond a temporary stimulation by
having eaten it. . . -
. Alalta-"Vlta, I best . whole white wheat
mixed with- pure barley malt . extract,
thoroughly steamed and . cooked and
every flake baked to a crisp, is rich in
nutrition and Is assimilated readily
even by the weakest stomach. Every
one of its health-giving, strength-
building elements is taken up by the
human economy to. nourish and sustain
life. v " â¢ .
No wonder that Malta-Vita Is called
"The . Perfect Food." and that physi-
cians recommend' it for the sick and
the well, the weak and the strong. \u25a0
And- Malta-Vita is so good to eat â
not at all like the tasteless variety of
flaked foods. A perfect breakfast Is
impossible without it and it's Just as
good three times a day. Try, a bowl-
ful with cream or fruit. You never
tasted anything so good.
Malta-Vita 13 always ready to eat.

YOUNGSTER HAS
BRIGHT FUTURE
Yields to Tempting Offer
of the Pirate Magnate
and Turns Others Down
MILL GET FAT SALARY
Uncle's Star First Baseman
Is to Beceive More Money
Than Any Other Native
Joe Nealon will wear a Plttsburg uni
form next season. The big first baseman
yesterday afternoon signed a contract
with Fred Clarke, manager of the Pirates,
and the other magnates who were look
ing to get the ~young star will have to
seek elsewhere for a man to take his
place. Nealon will probably receive be
tween $S>ooo end SUOOO fcr his season's
work.
Manager Clarke has been in this city
for a Tv^ek trying to sign Nealon. In the
meantime, Ted Sullivan, representing Cin
cinnati, worked heaven and earth to get
:he youngster to go to the Reds. Joe's
father grave his permission several days
ago, but Joe did not want to sign the
contract till he was sure that everything
was all right and that he would get an
even break.
Old George Van Haltren, the veteran
center fielder of the Commuters, is given
crefilt for landing the prize. Joe and the
old man have been very friendly since
the former became a professional a few
months ago and when the Pittsburg peo
ple first made their offer Van tried to
get Joe to accept it. He has been after
the youngster ever since and his efforts
probably brought the deal about.
In signing up with Pittsburg Nealon
gees to a team that is fast and always in
the running. When a young player breaks
into the big league he always does better
it he gets with a winning club. Pittsburg
is s-jre to be one, two, three in the big
race and if Joes makes any kind of a
showing there he will surely be a popular
idol, for the fans of the Smoky City are
the most ardent in the National League.
Nealon is the highest salaried youngster
who ever went from the Pacific Coast lo
join a big league team and if the records
\u25a0were looked un they would probably show
that Joe is getting as much money as any
youngster who ever broke into fast com
pany from any part of the United States.
The youngster has everything that goes
to make a great ball player and if nothing
happens lie will probably be a star of the
first water before he is In the big league
two months.
MURDER CHARGED
TO THREE MEN
Special Dispatch to The CalL
HELENA, Mont., Nov. 6.â A profound
eensation has been created in Lewistown
by the axrest of three prominent and
well known citizens, two of them busi
r.ess men, charged with the murder last
August of Samuel Studzlnski, a jeweler
und pawnbroker, for the purpose of rob
i>ery. Â» StudzinEki has a wealthy brother
in the jewelry business in San Francisco,
\u25a0who ls> supposed to have engaged a num
ber of Pinkerton detectives to work on
the case, and it is these .raen who have
cauted the arrests of H. Ray Long, Ed
ward W. Taylor and A. Julius Helnicke.
They are in jail and closely guarded, not
even members of their families being per
mitted to see them.
The crime with which the men are
charged was one of the most brutal in
the history of Central Montana. Stud
zlnski was known to possess $20)0 In gold
coin and a number of diamonds. The lat
ter he had removed from a bank a few
days before the murder, and it is sup
posed this was the direct' cause of the
crime. At any rate Studzinski was found
tnurdered on the morning of August 26,
having been felled with a blunt instru
ment of some sort.
In addition he had been choked to death
with a Etout twine and pinned to his body
and on a stove in the room were found
placards written in the blood of the dead
man indicating that It had been an act
âof revenge. The little store had been
thoroughly^ ransacked and the strong box
rifled of Its valuable contents.
Four men were arrested, but later dis
charged, no evidence being found that
â¢would convict them. The local officers,
while not abandoning the case, were un
able to find other clews. Pinkerton men,
however, have worked on the matter for
some time and claim to have indisputable
evidence connecting Ixmg, Taylor and
Uelnicke with the crime. Studzinski was
a* Russian Jew â¬5 years old.
PRATTLING OF BABE

ST. LOUIS. Nov. 6.â Reinhardt IL
Friemann. who Is seeking a divorce from
Millie Friemann, saw his one-year-old
boy for the' first time to-day, when he
went into cci*rt to prosecute his suit. The
sight of his child, which he had never
before been permitted to see, softened
Friemann's heart and lie agreed to a dis
missal of the suit, became recociled with
his wife and left the courthouse carry
o Ing the- child in his anus. â¢\u25a0.
\u25a0The pleadings of the Judge and attaches
of the court were added to the prattling
of the baby boy in the task of bringing
the father and mother together.
The Friemanns were rcarried on Decem
ber 20, 1903, and separated on April 10,
3901, when Mrs. FriÂ«Â»mann went to live

desertion.

HOOTEKS GET TOGETHEK
Throng the Armory to Take
Part in the Annual Ax
Bally of Blue and Gold
BERKELEY. Nov.- 6.â Football fans at
the university centered their interest to
day in the punting contest on the new
California football field, a contest in
which all the varsity squad took part.
The prize Is a silver cup, offered by R.
A. Roos of San Francisco. '> .V.
Roy Elliott proved to be the star
punter of the sauad, and his will be the
honor of having his name inscribed on
the silver cup as the champion of the
football team of 1905. It is planned to
have this punting contest made an annual
feature of the football season, and each
year the winner's name will be carved
on the trophy, under the direction of the
associated students' executive committee.
The ax rally at the armory on the
campus this afternoon attracted a crowd
of rooters who heard related anew the
story of how California men captured
Stanford's famous ax and kept it for
future generations of students at the
State University to gloat over. Clinton
Miller, who took part In the raid that
resulted In the capture of the ax, told
the story of the affair.
Joseph Bliss, who has been custodian of
the ax for a year, appointed King Sweesy
as his successor, and In Sweesy's hands
the ax will be placed to remain there
for twelve months.
The secret practice of the squad is be
ing continued daily and wfll be kept up
till Friday night. On Thursday is the
smoker rally, at which Coach Knibbs is
expected to speak.
â¢ SECRET WORK AT STANFORD.
Cardinal Mm Are Getting: Ready for
tbe Hlr finnif.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 6. â
Work behind closed gates continues on
the gridiron with ever increasing- se
verity as the time preceding the all-im
portant contest becomes shorter. Prob
ably the only opportunity for the root
ers to view the work of the eleven will
be on the day of the last practice,
which most likely will be Thursday.
During this week a revolution in the
back field is <fue to occur. Even if
Crow is back in his old position atfull
back, it Is not likely that In his pVes
ent condition he will last the entire
game. "Bull" Chalmers took his place
Saturday until he was retired with a
cramped leg and Slusher was supple
mented. The manner in which this
youth ripped things up filled the hearts
of the bleacherites with confidence.
All feel assured, should the stanch full
back be obliged to yield his position,
that they will have a substitute who
will be every bit as good on the of
fense, but a trifle less proficient at
backing up the line.
When Captain "Bull" went off the
field Saturday, assisted by team mates,
the faces of all who hold the fate of
the cardinal dear to their hearts were
elongated to the limit, but now all feel
particularly thankful that the stand-by
of the team is about the campus as
well as ever.
The source of the most anxiety is
Jimmie Stanford, who Is still flat on
his back w_lth the grip. The valuable
end is, however, on the road to recov
ery and will enter the game well, but
not as strong as under morV; favorable
conditions.
D. P. Crawford has a slight attack
of water on the knee, which, although
not serious, causes him at times much
acute pain.
Lyons Is the choice of end for. the
opposite extremity from Jimmie Stan
ford's and has as yet been fortunate in
escaping serious accidents.
SIX MEN HURT
ON SHIPBOARD
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Nov. 6.â The breaking of
a spar to-night hurled six men engaged
In discharging \u25a0 the cargo lof the Costa
Rico, at the Alnsworth dock, down a
depth of twenty feet and resulted in the
serious injury of three of them, one of
whom, Eugene Ahem, may die. While
unloading wire, one of the reels, weigh
ing a ton, was allowed to drop on the
runway. The sudden smash broke the
spar support and i-.e six men standing on
the runway were immediately thrown
down on the three-foot wide, pontoon be
tween the ship and the dock with the
reel of the cable tumbling after them. In
their fall every one of the men sustained
some injury.
Immediately after leaving San Fran
cisco the Costa Rico ran into severe
northwest gales and had to buck them
all the way up to Tillamook, with the
result that she came up to the bar twen
ty-four hours late. Her forward house
was stove In, a damage which will re
quire a large force of carpenters several
days to repair.

PRINCE CHARLES
WILL BE CHOSEN
j WASHINGTON, Nov. 6. â Christian
Hauge. Charge d' Affaires ad Interim of
Norway, in an Interview published to-day
discussed the coming election to the Nor
wegian throne by referendum vote.
"According to latest accounts I think
Prince Charles of Denmark will be elected
to the throne and accept," ~ said Mr.
Hauge. : "The election will be held on
November 12, on which day voting will
occur throughout the country, but as
many places are remote, without wire
connection, the vote .will not be counted
for perhaps a week afterward. It prob
ably would be about the first of Decem
ber before the Prince would ascend the
throne, and perhaps several days would
elapse before the reorganization could be
completed. The Cabinet, you know, is
the one that severed the ties between us
and Sweden. While all the members will
probably resign formally, they likely
will be reappointed. One or two, I under
stand, are determined to leave public life,
but I am not at liberty to mention which
ones." ,

MANUFACTURE OF FKESH
WATER PEARLS EXPLAINED
Dr. Slonakcr Tells Many Interesting?
Things of the Clams nnd Mus
sels of the Mississippi.
Dr. James Rollln Slonaker of Stan
ford University gave an Illustrated
lecture on the "Fresh Water Pearl of
the Mississippi ; River" before the Acad
emy of Sciences last evening. The pro
fessor presented many excellent pic
tures : and explained .'the process of
marketing the pearl, from the catching
the clams and mussels in the river
to the finishing touches lof the pearl
in the factory, which is done by airls
who get from $5 ,to $7 a week.
The cost of manufacturing these
pearls is about 30 cents a gross and
they are sold at first cost. for 40 cents,
which leaves only a small margin for
the manufacturer. The mussel beds
are rapidly becoming extinct, owing to
the great number, that are caught every
year for this purpose.

Some skin diseases are active in Summer, ; while others wait until â¢ cold
.weather to manifest themselves. Winter Eczema sleeps in the system through
the long hot months, and gives no sign of its presence; but at the coming of
Winter the trouble asserts itself and it becomes one of the most painful and
distressing of all skin diseases. The blood is filled with poisonous acids
which seem to be excited by the cold; and as these are thrown off through
;. the pores and glands, the skin cracks and bleeds, the flesh becomes hot and
: feverish and the itching intense. The natural oils which keep the skin soft
\ and pliant are dried up by, the cold," bleak winds, causing it to become hard
and dry, giving it that shiny, leathery appearance, characteristic of the disease.
? The head, face, hands and feet are the usual points of attack, though/other
; parts of the body maybe affected. So painful and distressing is the trouble
that the sufferer constantly *' doctors " and 'treats it trying to get relief. -
Soothing washes, { medicated ointments and salves are used, but aside from
giving temporary relief they do no good. The cause is poisonous adds in !

Encounter Take* Place at the Elks*
Quarter* In City of
Topeka.
TOPEKA. Kans.. Nov. 6.-Frank P. 51c-
Lennan. publisher of the State Journal,
to-day issued a signed statement in rela
tion to the encounter between himself
and former State Treasurer Kelly yester
day at the Elks" clubrooms. McLennan
denies that there was any exchange of
angry words between himself and Kelly.
"unless the abusive words \u25a0of â¢ one man
could be called an exchange."
Kelly used abusive language, he states,
and struck at the editor, landing a
glancing blow on the side of the neck
which did no damage. McLennan, who
was a guest at the club, hesitated a
moment. heÂ» says., debating whether he
should return the blow, but when he
considered the place and the 'day. he
remarked: "I have some regard for the
proprieties of thlsyclubroom, even If you
have not."
Kelly wa-s Immediately surrounded by
several \u25a0 men. among whom was Mr.
Stotts. a reporter on the State Journal,
who knocked Mr. Kelly to one side. This,
Mr. McLennan says, ended the affair,
Kelly going in one direction and Mc-
Lennan toward the front of the office.
McLennan did not retreat down a corri
dor or in any other direction. .

MATE JOHNSON
IS CENSURED
Captain Beriningham Tartly
Suggests tha Chain Gang
for Careless Mariners
INSPECTOKS ARE UPHELD
Stranding of Vessels on the
Northern Coast Is Much
Too Frequent, He Remarks
"I have no patience with a mariner who
negligently strands a steam -vessel on the
coast of California when bound to or
from the Columbia River or Puget Sound.
If a law were enacted to put a mariner,
responsible for a disaster of that charac
ter, to work breaking stones for public
roads. If only for a brief period, such
would have a wholesome and salutary
effect in preventing the too frequent
stranding of vessels on those routes." ..'
JThese scorching words were written
yesterday by United States Supervising
Inspector John Bermingham in a decision
sustaining the action of United States
Local Inspectors Bolles and Bulger for
having siisoended for six months E. E.
Johnson of the steamer Santa Barbara,
which was run ashore near Point Arena
on October 1. Johnson took an appeal to
the Supervising Inspector and was re
warded very frankly with the opinion of
Captain Bermingham.
The Supervising Inspector further said:
As declared by the lower court, Captain
Zaddart was negligent in not putting his or
ders for the night in an order book, with most
positive instructions to be called at a time
prior to the possibility of the ship taking the
shore for which she was headed at an angle
of about half a point to get into smoother
water, which was a reasonable procedure If
the most ordinary care had been exercised In
her navigation. She actually took the bottom
a little, to the westward of the point she was
deliberately steered 'for. - .. ;, \u25a0
The appellant cannot' escape his share of the
responsibility for the stranding of the Santa
Barbara. True, he was not on deck at the
time of the actual occurrenco; his relief took
place," though, a few minutes previous to that,
and at a time when the land was obscured by
the prevalence of a haze, such as the master
had ordered that he should at once be made
aware of. That It was then clear oft shore Is
no mitigation of the negligence and unskill
fulnesson the part of . the appellant, who was
the ranking deck officer on that occasion, and
so; supposed to possess superior intelligence;
hence he should have called the master before
leaving the deck to the relieving officer. There
fore, the judgment of the lower court in the
case of the appellant, E. E. Johnson, is hereby
affirmed.. .. :

by the Government at San
Francisco and San Diego
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.â Sixteen mil
lion dollars will be necessary to com
plete the engineering, works of the
fortifications* of the seacoast of the
United States under the present plans
of the Endicott board, according to the
report of Brigadier General McKenzie,
chief of engineers. There already haa
been appropriated for this purpose
$23,963,434. Permanent projects at
thirty-one, different points have been
adopted and most of. them are well un
der way. Among these points are San
Diego, Cal., San Francisco, Columbia
River and Puget Sound.
The defense. of the great lakes and
the ' St. Lawrence is under considera
tion. The estimates for. the completion
of the fortifications do not contemplate
anything more than the projects out
lined by the Endicott board. Modern
appliances and additional projects,
which may .be adopted by the Taf t
board appointed last summer, and the
fortifications of the insular possessions
may Increase the estimate when addi
tional work is approved by Congress,
lt Is estimated that $4,263,364 will be
required to put into execution by the
engineering department the schemes of
the artillery and signal corps for fire
control of the seacoast defenses.
Among the estimats for continuing
contracts are the following:

Your recent letter- asking me. to become a

ability. I think It ia eminently proper that
his high -character and public service should

, | It seems, ta me, howevr, that this should
'be. undertaken by." those who wete nearer to
him In- every "way tlian I can claim to have
been. Another reason stronger than this for
hesitation Is found -In my reluctance to b4
identified with a project to which I cannot
give the least attention. I am not at all
satisfied to be- nominally a director In such
a movement without performing any useful
duty and this would be. my: exact predicament
should I accept such, a place In the directorate
of your association. "',,"",Â«'"\u25a0

have it. J ; : â¢ I "...
"The President knows me pretty
well land he need not ask any one if
I am capable of filling the bill. . Be

MRS. ARMSTKOXQ -SAYS: I had tÂ«eÂ«a a.

diseased ears. I could stand the catarrh, but
the awful pains in my ears were, at times al-
most unbearable. The. pains, however, wero
only a part of my ear trouble. I was at time*
almost stone deaf and from,, both my ears thmrs
was a constant discharge, the jsdor of whtca
was most distressing. -- * ' â¢'
I kept myself poor'payiftK doctor bills and
drug bills, and until 1- took up the Electro-
Chemic treatment nothing Â«ver did me a bit of

both e3rj was thoroughly cured, aiul from the.
rtart' of the treatment my hearing gradually
rtturr.ed and now I Iwar wei; my catarrh la
cured, all pain !s rone, the awful rlnslnic
noises hayÂ» stopped and my ears are healthy
in every way.
I wish every sufferer from catarrh and deaf-
ness could know what Electro-Chemistry has
done i for me. I know that what it has dons
for ire it would do for others. â¢ I am sure ni> \u25a0

Xevr York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 6. â Speculative spirit re
salsed its composure to-cay after being upsei
by the very weak bank statement of Satur
day. This influence was etili In evidence dur
ing the early niarket to-day and was em
phasized by the strength of the money mar- :
ket both tor call loans and time contracts. ,
The resistance offered t% the selling pressure
under the circumstances was considered a con
vincing demonstration of the inherent strength
of the nock market. The 'reports bearing on
the volume of railroad tralnc j coming trom
railroad olticials give evidence of abounding
activity in ail lines of business. Complaints
of car shortage has become an old story now
â¢ *and the Ireight blockades which result at
>4*cpme Â°^ l i e great business centers are a
1 |>csitive detriment to Industrial operations.
JieporU ot railroad net earnings for Septem
her received to-day include the Harrinian
Pacifies, and the large increase reported helped
the recovery Sa these stocks. With the sur
plus reserves of the banks down to below
$2,500,(>00. according to the bank statement,
the tvet-k" opened with evidence of the forcea
of depletion still at work- An opening rate
Tor ca*l money at <> per cent and a promised
rise to 7 j>cr cent was hardly a surprise there
fore, in view of the evidence of the close
encroachÃitnt upon the limits of the surplus
reserves ot the banks. The higher rate for
call money and the strength of this money
had the ffTect of relaxing the tension of the
torelgn exchange and there was a fall ot
fully a quarter of a cent in the pound sterling
rate. Ihe 8 per cent money rate after â¢
o'clock caused the market to waver, after
which it rallied and cioeed slightly Irregular.
. Bonds were heavy. Total eales, par value,
$2.(Â£U,tXX>.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

REPORTS FUNDS
ARE OVERDRAWN
Expert Says Fire Commission
Has a Deficit of $8000 in
Its Present Appropriation
WILL GET CAE SERVICE
United Railroads Will Build
Road for the Benefit of Vis
itation Valley Residents
The Finance Committee of the Board
if Supervisors received a report yester
lay from Expert Cyril Williams- to the
iffect that the Fire Commission has over
drawn Its appropriation by the sum of
jSOOOanrlng the first four months of the
present fiscal year. The report was the
result of the withholding by the com
mittee of the payment of a bill for $2650,
presented by the Pioneer Automobile
Company for an automobile furnished to
\he Fire Department. Williams reported
that the sum of $18,800 was allowed last
fune for new apparatus, including an
engine and truck, but an automobile had
aot been included in the allowance.
The committee is disinclined to approve
the bill for the automobile unless the Fire
Commission makes ud its deficit of $SOOO
by reducing Its expenditures so as to
comply with the one-twelfth provision of
the charter, and Is willing to pay It out
of funds other than those allowed for
new apparatus. Chief Engineer Sullivan
was cited to appear at next Monday's
meeting of the committee to explain the
purchase of the automobile.
The Board of Supervisors, acting on the
recommendation of the Finance Clmmit
tee, allowed the sum of $500 out of the
urgent necessity fund for the purpose of
making surveys to establish the official
grades on San Bruno avenue from
Dwight street "to Railroad avenue as a
preliminary to the establishment of a
street car service thereon by the United
Railroads. Representatives of the Visl
tacion Valley Improvement Club appeared
before the committee and urged that the
pppropriation be made in order that the
residents in the district may be accom
modated with street car facilities.
Tirey L. Ford, general counsel of the
United Railroads, stated that the cor
poration stood ready to build the road If
the Supervisors and people interested de
sired it, but construction could not begin
until the grades had been officially de
termined. The sum appropriated will en
able the City Engineer to make the neces
sary surveys, which will be done at once.
The following bill? were passed to print:
Fully accepting the roadway of Twen
tieth "street, between Eureka and Dia
mond.
Fixing the widths of Fulton street from
Stanyan street to the Great Highway, and
on Onondagra and Ocean avenues, prelim
inary to the grading of the thorough-
Tares.
Ordering the construction of artificial
stone sidewalks on both sides of Market
street, from Fourteenth to Seventeenth.
Changing and establishing grades on
Valencia street, from Nineteenth to
Twenty-fifth.
The following bills were finally passed:
Accepting a deed from the Pooe Estate
Company to land for the opening of Bel
vedere. Alma and Grattan streets.
Abolishing the sidewalk widths on
Pacific avenue, between Laurel street and
the westerly termination of Pacific ave
nue.
Conditionally accepting J street, be
tween Fifth and Seventh avenues.
Designating and numbering certain
blocks of land in the Western Addition
and Richmond districts. -.
Amending an ordinance so as to provide
that in all artificial stone sidewalks here

of the sidewalk.

SALLY SHARP
"Beautiful as sweet! and young as beau
tiful! and soft as young! and gay as soft!
and innocent as gay"â this the tale of
the dear, blessed, rose-tipped little debu
tantes who danced last night at their
first "grown-up" ballâ the first Assembly
of the winter of '05 and '06."
To be sure, the Greenway dance pre
ceded It by a few sunsets, where a few
of the debutantes made a cute little curt
sy to society; but the dance was essen
tially a dance of belles, and, be it known,
the reign of the belles is an autocracy.
Therefore was the Assembly chosen by
many Of the "little maids from school"
as a luring environment wherein to cele
brate the formal accession to the smart
setâ wise little maids from school.
The patrons of the club. Mrs. Alfred
Hunter Voorhies, Mrs. James Potter
Langhorne, Mrs. John D. Spreckels, Mrs.
William E. Herrin, Mrs. William A. Mc-
Kittrick, Mrs. Eleanor Martin, Mrs. Ar
thur .W. Foster, Mrs. Bowman McCalla,
are good friends of the men, for it was
given out when the invitations were is
sued that the Assemblies must open early
and close early. Business In the morning,
of course. . -
Much Jlub-dub has been loosed about a
pruning of the lists of the invited guests.
The truth of the. matter is that .the list
is much the same as last year, the . only
eliminations being young married people
in whose debutantes i are to be
presented, a course made necessary, '.not
for social disqualifications, but because
of the necessity of "making room." With
these eliminations there are 225 guests
upon the club's roster, of whom a good
two-thirds were present at the. Palace
last night at- the first smart rodeo. And
a stunning dance it was, with Its charm
ing hostess- to speed the fun, and the
debutantes to lend it beautyâ with the
belles and beaux to make it "go."
Supper was served at midnight, j the
hour that quite a few smart men and
maids made their appearance. Isn't this
sailing In at the hour of the "feed" rather
questionable form?

TO SELECT SITE
FOR CARHOUSE
Supervisors to Pass on Two
;iLots^o Expedite Construc
tion of Geary Street Edad
ASKS FOR NEW SCHOOL
Drew : Urges Finance Com
mitee to Erect Building for
Â§ Polytechnic Evening High
At yesteday's meeting of the Board of
Supervisors , Supervisor d" Ancona an
nounced that the joint Committee on Fin
ance 1 and . Public Utilities will on next
Friday: afternoon make; a 1 final selection
of, ; a siie for a- power and car house for
the proposed municipal. Geary street rail
road.^ 1 The* committee has practically
\u25a0 agreed e to; select a site at thÂ© northeast
corner of â¢ Geary and Baker streets, of
fered H f0r. 416,750 in preference to one at
the. corner of Point Lobos and . Josephine
avenues, for : $15,000." .Engineer Stut ad
vised the -committee that the first named
site was preferable because it would ef
fect a saving â¢ both in the maintenance
and construction of the road if the power
house were located there instead of at
Josephine avenue. "
\u25a0 D' Ancona said that, the final selection
had -been. delayed owing to the Illness of
'Chairman Braunhart of the Public Utili
ties Committee,, but it. was desired to
take action in order to expedite the build
ing of the road.: The owner of the site on
Josephine street had- reduced the price on
the lot and the matter will be threshed
out at the meeting called for the purpose.
William J. Drew, \ head of the drawing
department of 'the :Humboldt evening
school, appeared before -jthe Finance Com
mittee to urge that an appropriation ofj
1150,000 be* allowed out of the school bond;
moneys to purchase a site and build a
polytechnic; evening high school building
separate, from- the , polytechnic day high
school. Drew stated that a site for the
latter structure had been purchased in a
block' near the park, which was located
too far from the, center of. the city to be
suited for an' evening school. Drew said
a lot could be purchased on Grove street,
near Larkin, for $50,000 and $100,000 would
be needed to erect" the building. After
listening to Drew the committee directed
him-to file a petition on the lines of his
verbal request, and it will be referred to
the joint Committee on Finance and Pub
lic Utilities for a report.
5 The sum of $450. was allowed out of the
urgent, necessity 'ftind to build cesspools
on -Franklln;street, ffrom Vallejo to Lom
bard, to connect with a sewer built many
years ago.' . E. W. Burr, who owns prop
