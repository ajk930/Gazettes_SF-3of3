ELYRIA. Ohio, Jan. 18.âAndrew
Carnegie placed $15,000 in the hands
of Rev. W. E. Cadmus, pastor of the
First Congregational Church of this
city, to-day to be distributed to the
depositors who lost their money in the
failed Citizens' National Bank of Ober
lin as a result of the Chadwick loans.
Carnegie in a letter asked Cadmus to
investigate among the students at
Oberlin College and learn the amount
they lost. When this is done, it is un
derstood, more money will be forth
coming. Judge Steele of Oberlin will
appoint a committee to investigate the
most worthy cases. Carnegie has also
given Cadmus $3000 to reimburse the
Oberlin Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation.
CLEVELAND. Ohio, Jan. 18. âTwo
physicians were called to see Mrs. Cas
pic L. Chadwick in jail this afternoon.
She is said to be suffering from physi
cal and mental collapse. Attorney
Dawley says she is afflicted with heart
trouble and would not be able to stand
a trial in court in her present condi
tion. Mrs. Chadwick is said to have
frequent fainting spells.
The announcement that Carnegie
had decided to reimburse losers by the
failure of the Oberlin National Bank
has seemed to greatly affect Mrs. Chad
wick.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Colo., Jan. B.âThe Denver
Post to-night charged that influential
men in several departments of the
United States Government were impli
cated in a land steal ln connection with
the opening of the Uintah Indian reser
vation in Utah. The Post says:
"Ex-Governor Odell is one of the
large stockholders of the Raven Min
ing Company, which has the practical
ownership of the elaterite beds. Jo
seph Leiter of Chicago is an owner of
stock. The American Steel and Wire
Company, a part of the great United
States steel trust, in which J, Pierpont
Morgan Is the moving spirit and John
D. Rockefeller an important factor, is
also interested and is using large quan
tities of elaterite. Henry C. Payne, late
Postmaster General, was a director of
the Raven Company.
' "There Is no place in the known
world where elaterite exists except* on
the Uintah Indian reservation. The
mines there cover an area about twen
ty miles long and forty miles wide. The
ore sells for 5 cents a pound. The Ra
ven Mining Company and the Florence
Mining Company, which are harmoni
ously blended together, have exclusive
control of the beds.
"The Uintah Indian reservation was
created by an act of Congress in the
year 1869. In 1891 the Raven Company
secured its lease from the Indians.
Five Indians had to sign the' papers.
The redskins were feted In Chicago for
a week or more before they were taken
to Washington. They were driven
around in a tally-ho, dined and wor
, shiped as heroes. As soon as they
j signed the lease in Washington they
were dropped like cold potatoes.
"About two years ago the deal was
made in Congress whereby the Raven
Company was given extensive tracts of
land in return for the lease made by
I the Indians."
The president of the Raven Com
pany is Charles F. Pflster, a Milwau
kee capitalist. A. H. Morgan, jthe
treasurer, Is president of the Chicago
Varnish Works. Other officers are D.
D. Thoman, secretary and manager; T.
( J. Boggs and W. S. Potwin, directors.
'The company has 100 claims and the
deposits of elaterite and gilsonite are
said to be worth millions of dollars.
The Post says United States Senators
are Involved, whose names will be
given. v
THE San Francisco CALL
Miss Gertrude Wells, who is widely
known in San Francisco, is among the
missing, and much anxiety is felt by
her friends regarding her whereabouts.
She left the St. Francis Hotel seven
days ago, and since then not the slight
est trace of the young woman has been
discovered, although her friends and
the management of the St. Francis
have been making diligent Inquiries
about her.
The missing woman is the sister of
Mrs. Fred Webster, widow of the late
well-known San Francisco clubman.
Mrs. Webster and her sister have been
living -in New York for some time
since the death of the former's hus
band. Early in December Mrs. Web
ster came to San Francisco for the
purpose of settling up certain matters
connected with the estate of her late
husband. She was afterward followed
to this city by her sister, who arrived
here shortly after Mrs. Webster had
given up her apartments at the St.
Francis. Apparently Miss Gertrude
Wells expected to meet her sister here,
for upon her arrival at the St. Francis
she asked for Mrs. Webster, and
showed her disappointment when the
clerk of the hotel informed her that her
sister had left for the East.
Miss Gertrude was assigned to com
fortable apartments, and for three
weeks she was frequently seen about
the hotel lobby and ladies' rooms. At
evening she was often observed go
ing in and out of the hostelry. Seven
days ago she walked out of the hotel
and that is the last seen of her.
FRIENDS MAKE INQUIRY.
The first intimation the management
of the hotel received of the disappear
ance of its fair guest was when the
maid on the floor on which is located
Miss Wells' apartment reported that
the room had not been occupied. Think
ing possibly the occupant was visiting
friends, no heed was paid to her ab
sence for several days. Meanwhile fre
querft inquiries were being made for
vhe young woman at ths hotel and her
continued absence resulted in an in
vestigation that led the hotel manage
ment to suspect that Miss Wells had
possibly met with some mishap.
Inquiry among Miss Wells* friends in
this city failed to reveal her where
abouts, and an effort to get some in
formation regarding her from her sis
ter's local attorney, Ludwig M. Hoef
ler, was eaually as fruitless. An in
spection dx the missing woman's
apartments revealed many circum
stances that would suggest that she had
not departed on a long trip, for her
abundant supply of wearing apparel
was found hanging in the closet, and
her combs and brushes and jewelry
and trinkets were lying carelessly upon
her bureau. In short, there was noth
ing in the way of evidence in Miss
Wells' rooms that would indicate that
she had made any preparations for a
prolonged absence.
In discussing the strange case last
evening, one of the representatives of
the St. Francis said that the careful
Investigation made by the hotel had
failed ln its purpose of bringing to
light the slightest explanaton for Miss
Wells' absence. She had paid her first,
week's bill, and the fact that she had
not promptly settled for the second
week had caused no particular concern,
for it is known that she is a responsi
ble person, and no thought of her de
linquency had entered the minds of the
hotel management. Two days ago the
woman's effects were gathered together
and placed in the hotel storeroom to
await a claimant.
A theory that Miss Wells may be
lying ill somewhere in this city sug
gested itself yesterday after the fact
became known that she had come to
San Francisco for her health. This bit
of information was gleaned from At
torney Hoefler. who, while discussing
the case last evening, said:
ATTORNEY HOEFLER WORRIED.
"Miss Wells' disappearance is as
much 'a mystery to me as the people in
the St. Francis Hotel. I cannot dis
cover any cause for her strange absence
unless it be that she has been taken
ill somewhere, and in that case I would
imagine, that those with whom she
might be staying would notify her
friends. Certainly the young woman
would need clean clothing, and that
fact would necessitate her friends vis
iting the St. Francis. As to any finan
cial embarrassments that Miss Wells
might have experienced, I will .say that
her sister left with me certain funds
that could readily be applied to Miss
Wells' needs. Recently Mrs. Webster
advised me that her sister had been ill
in New York and was coming to San
Francisco the hope of bettering her
health. There is a bare possibility that
unexpected sickness may be the solu
tion" of her absence."
Attorney Hoefier said he would re
new the inquiry for the missing woman
to-day and would advise her sister of
the facts in the case. Miss Wells is an
attractive woman, whose stately fig
ure, properly gowned, made her an ob
ject of attention among the other
guests of the St. Francis during her
short stay there. During that period
she made no complaint of illness to
those she met, and when lÂ«Â«t seen,
leaving the hotel, she appe#*ar In the
best of spirits. r S

SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, JANUARY 19, 1905.
FIVE VOTES
PUT SWAYNE
IN DISGRACE
House by Narrow
Majority Votes to
Impeach.
â. Â»â 
Gillett ol California Makes
Vain Plea lor Florida
Federal Judge.
â*â
* WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.âThe House
of Representatives to-day adopted the
twelve articles of impeachment against
Judge Charles Swayne of the District
Court of Northern Florida, which had
been presented by its special commit
tee of investigation. The Speaker was
authorized to appoint a member to pre
sent the case to the Senate and con
duct the impeachment proceedings be
fore that body.
ThiS action was the culmination of a
debate which has been in progress for
more than a â¢week, and which has de-
veloped much partisan feeling. The
first vote, that to table the first arti
cles, which related .to the falsification
of expenses, went against Judge
Swayne by the naY/frw margin of five
votes. This was "rewarded' as ths test
vote, as the charge regarding expenses
was the only one concurred in by the
members of the committee signing the
minority report. The motion to table
these articles were lost, 160 to 166.
Twenty-four Republicans voted with
the Democrats against tabling, and
three Democrats voted with the Re
publicans to table. On roll call these
three articles were adopted.
Articles 4 and 5, relating to the free
use of a private car by Judge Swayne,
were made the subject of a separate
vote and adopted. Like action followed
on articles 6 and 7, charging him with
non-residence in his district. This was
the last roll call, as articles 8, 9, 10 and
11, relating to the Davis-Belden con
tempt case, and article 12, relating to
the O'Neil contempt case, were de
clared adopted on viva voce votes.
The last time the House voted to pre
sent articles of impeachment was ln
1876, when it voted the impeachment of
W. W. Belknap, Secretary of War un
der President Grant.
The debate to-day was chiefly nota
ble for the closing arguments in the
case. That for Judge Swayne was
made by Gillett of California and that
for impeachment by Palmer of Penn
sylvania. Gillett made an earnest plea
for the Judge and Palmer spoke
strongly for purity on the bench and
for impeachment.
Gillett read a telegram, signed, he
said, by the leading merchants and cit
izens of Pensacola, Fla., condemning
the impeachment proceedings and ex
pressing a sentiment friendly to Judge
Swayne. Judge Swayne, he said, would
never have been proceeded against and
"persecuted" if it had not been for the
O'Nell contempt proceedings.
Gillett spoke of the car incident as
having occurred years ago and said it
would be trifling to present seriously
such a charge. He asked where It
would end if Congress started to Im
peach men for riding ln a private car.
He said he had statements showing it
was the Intention that $10 a day should
be charged by Judges, and that he had
a statement from the Secretary of the
Treasury showing other Judges had
charged $10.
Bell of California was one of the
three Democrats who voted against
impeachment.

WAN-WEN-TSAO, VIRTUALLY PREMIER OF CHINA. WHO IS BEING GUIDED
BY THE AMERICAN SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE DIPLOMATIC TABK
OF CHECKING RUSSIA S ATTEMPT TO COMPLICATE WAR SITUATION.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.âSecretary Hay has assumed the master
hand In the Far Eastern situation. By a bold move he has check
mated Russia in her designs upon China and established his influ
ence as the dominating factor in peace negotiations which Anally
would end the war. In his anxiety to preserve the integrity of
China, which Is the great ambition of his life. Hay is again pledg
ing the powers of Europe to a strict compliance with his note of Feb
ruary 10, which resulted in the agreement that hostilities should be
confined to a specified area.
Special PUpatch to ThÂ« Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.âIt was offl- j
cially admitted to-day that Secretary |
Hay had sent a note to all of the pow
ers, except Russia and Japan, asking
them If they still were in favor of pre
serving China** integrity and main
taining the op>n door. This Inquiry,
which Hay had had in mind for some
time, was hastened by a hint from
some source that is not divulged that
Russia waV preparing to make an im
portant move. Without any definite
information, he suspected that the
Russian move would be a declaration
involving charges of violation of neu
trality by China, which would be made
an excuse for the invasion of China
proper. The developments of the next
few days proved the correctness of
Hay's guess, and the results, which are
here stated for the first time, show how
cleverly he has headed oft* the Rus
sians in their plan to complicate the
situation.
Great Britain. Germany and Italy
have replied to Hay's inquiry as to
their Intentions and have bound them
selves anew to preserve the integrity
of China and the open door. The other
powers have not been heard from, but
it is expected that their replies will be
equally favorable. Whether they are
or not. Hay believes that he now has
sufficient influence behind him to pre
vent any extension of the war zone, on
any condition. With the United States.
England, Germany and Italy standing
flrmly for Chinese integrity and the
open door. Hay considers it certain
that Russia will not dare to invade
China or succeed by any means in in
volving China ln the struggle.
GERMAN INTERESTS MENACED.
This country would not flght to pre
serve either China or the open door,
but England and Germany must, for
their interests in the Yangtse Valley
and on the Shantung Peninsula would
be menaced by any extension of the
zone of actual hostilities. Russia must
promise that they would not be dis
turbed, but in the light of recent events
Hay has no Idea that the Russian
promise would be accepted by either
England or Germany. It is Hay's con
viction that the Kaiser's friendship for
the Czar would be broken the moment
German interests were threatened, as
they would be by any invasion of
China by Russia,
In binding the powers to a new
agreement to protect China, Hay was
also moved by a desire to strengthen
his hands ln the final peace negotia
tions. It now will be impossible, he
believes, for any division of China to
follow the close of the war. whether
Russia or Japan wins. Hay believes
that Japan will win, and he does not
wish to see the Japanese deprived of
the fruits of their victory, as they were
in their war with China, by joint ac
tion of the powers, which would srive
Russia a slice of China as balm for her
wounds, each power at the same time
taking another slice on general prin
ciples.
With England, Germany and Italy
adhering to the principles which he has
laid down, regardless of what the other
powers may do, he believes that Rus
tpa soon will be forced to opep negotia
tions to end the war.
JAPAN'S COUNTER CHARGES.
TOKIO, Jan. 18.âThe following re
port has been received from Japanese
Manchurian headquarters:
"In the recent engagements it be
came evident that the Russians warn
being aided by many Chinese regulars.
A Japanese detachment surrounded
Russian cavalry and Chinese soldiers
In the vicinity of- Sanchia, west of
Ncwchwang, on January 14, and dis
persed them. The Russian casualties
were more than 300. The Japanese
cr.ptured a quantity of arms.
"Lieutenant General Mistchenko's
raiders were between 5000 and 6000
strong. After they were defeated at
Newchwang they retreated to the
north, passing Laotuniulu. Japanese
cavalry encountered the exhausted
Russians in the neighborhood of Lao
hoshe on Monday evening (January 16).
They report that the Russians wore
Chinese coats and caps, and that
among them were many entirely
clothed ln Chinese costumes and wear-
ing pigtails." g
ST. PETERSBURG, 'Jan. 18.âThe
Foreign Office expresses satisfaction
at the action taken by Secretary Hay
regarding the necessity for China's ad
hering rigidly to neutrality. It is dis
tinctly asserted here that Russia does
not desire to extend the area of hostil
ities to China, unless forced to do so.
Russia's notification to the powers that
she considers herself free to act in pro-,
tection of her own interests, it is point
ed out officially, is in the nature of a
formal warning of her position.
As a matter of fact, a very pessi
mistic view is taken here of the situa
tion in China, regardless of the profes
sions of the Peking Government. Ac
cording to Russian official reports, both
the Chinese Government and people
are falling more and more under Jap
anese Influence, especially since the fall
of Port Arthur.

SACAMENTO, Jan. 18. âThat Gov
ernor Pardee's appointments of the
last two years were above attack was
made plain this morning When the
Senate, which a week or two ago re
solved Itself into a committee of scru
tiny, unanimously confirmed the list
of officials submitted by the chief ex
ecutive.
After all, the Senate is going to \
provide for its constitutional junket- ,
era. This morning found everything '
ripe for their third attempt to carry |
out 1 their plans. Senator Shortridge, i
trho Jed the preceding fights against
the plans of the junketers, was absent
from his desk, so no opposition could
come from that quarter. Senator
Belshaw was busy with other matters,
and Senator Savage was out in the
â¢corridor enjoying a eigur. With the
coast thus cleared Senator Pendleton
presented the following resolution: j
Resolved. Thai the committee* on Finance, |
Edu.ia.ikia. Hospitals snd Asylums. Prisons and .
Reformatories and Public Buildings and j

Senate, ooittiinile a oummitiee to visit such
public institutions as they may deem necessary
in order that such institutions may be thor
a uglily inquired into and ssportad upon to the
Senate and that they be allowed their actual
expenses while engaged in committee work
and such leave of absence as may be herein
after determined by the Senate.
The resolution was read, and before
an argument could start as to its
met its Pendleton moved that it be
submitted to the Finance Committee
for further consideration. As there
was no objection the chair granted
the motion, and in another minute the
Senate was proceeding along its way.
To-morrow, it is said, the Finance
Committee will report favorably on
tht resolution, and then all that will
remain to be done is to draw on the
Treasurer for the expenses of the
junketers.
Senator George R Keane of San
Francisco introduced the most impor
tant bill of this morning's session. It
provides for the addition of two sec
tions to the Penal Code establishing
the eight-hour working day for all
artisans employed upon the public
works of the State. Its terms are sim
ilar to those of the Federal act and
provide for the forfeiture of rights
and the punishment of contractors
and employers that violate or cause to
be violated the terms of the bill.
- A bill that caused considerable good
natured discussion makes it a felony
to kill elk in the State of California. It
was said by some of the best known
sportsmen among the members that
the bill should be referred to the San
Francisco delegation for consideration,
as the only elk in the State they know
of 'are confined in the paddock of
Golden Gate Park.
Senator Leeke's bill making it the
duty of the Board of Supervisors of
each county to designate a proper per
son to see that fit burial is given to
the body of every honorably discharged
soldier, sailor or marine who served
during the war with Spain, tbe Philip
pine insurrection, the Civil War or the
war with Mexico, was recommended
by the Committee on Military Affairs,
finally passed by tbe Senate and sent
to the Assembly. The committee also
favorably reported on the resolution
providing for the arming of the Sons I
of Veterans with the Springfield rifles
-that were turned over to the Govern
ment by tbe National Guard at the
time of its rearmament with the Krag
"Jorgensen rifles.
. There promises to be Interesting de
velopments as the result of a resolu
tion introduced in the Senate by Sen
ator Carter asking for the appointment
of a committee of five to investigate
financial conditions at the University
of California. Carter, who came from
Los Angeles, is plain in his statement
that he does not like the financial sys
tem of the university. In the resolu
tion calling for the appointment of the
committee he says:
"Large appropriations have been
made by the Legislature to maintain
the institution, and during the last two
years sums of money aggregating be
tween $60,000 and $70,000 belonging to
certain university funds were misap
propriated by S. A. McKeown. an offi
cial, and I ask that a special committee
of five be appointed to make an inves
tigation of the university, to send for
books and witnesses, and report not
later than February 10."

Executive Explains
His Position in
the Matter.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 18â The ques
tion Of - appropriations is one that 1b
now interesting every citizen of the
State. Bills that will more than eat
up the surplus moneys of the treasury
âthose not actually required to carry
on the established institutionsâhave
already been introduced, and it now
rests with the Governor to do the prun
ing. When asked what his position
would be in regard to these appropria
tions. Governor Pardee said:
"Well, that's a pretty big subject,
and cannot be answered in a word or a
sentence. For, after all, appropria
tions are, of course, necessary for the
support of the State and Its institu
tions; and, therefore, must be made.
"The State raises by taxation a cer
tain amount of money, and this money
must be expended in such a way . that
the institutions of the State, its schools,
hospitals, penitentiaries, reformatories,
etc, etc, are well taken care of.
This is done by means of the
general appropriation bill. After the
general appropriation bill has been
figured out It is ascertained
what sum of money will be required to
run the State government and provide
for its institutions, then, by simply
subtracting the amount of the general
appropriation bill from the amount of
the State's income, the amount of
money to be applied to betterments of
existing institutions and the building
of new ones, both of which are pro
vided for by special appropriations,
can be readily ascertained.
"To illustrate: Suppose that the
State's income from taxation and other
sources amounts to $10,000,000. Suppose
that it costs us 19,000,000 to run the
State and provide for the needs of our
public schools, our high schools, our
university and five normal schools, our
institutions for the deaf and blind, our
Aye insane asylums, our home for the
adult blind, our home for the feeble
minded, our veterans' home, our two
penitentiaries, our two reformatories,
pay half of the salaries of all the Su
perior Judges, support the Su
preme Court and the appellate
courts, pay all of the salaries of the
State officials, support the National
Guard, build new roads and take care
of those we already have. Then, as is
evident, there can be but $1,000,000 put
into betterments of existing institu
tions or into providing new ones. It Is
simply a matter of two additions and
one sulfcraction.
"Of coiirse, there are many, many
things the State ought to do. But
where can we get the money with
which to do them all? It isn't so much
a question of what we ought to have
as it is a question of what we can get.
Just as in a private business, the
State's expense account cannot exceed
its income. And that is all there is
to it"
RECESSION OF YOSEMITE.
Joint Committee Will Report Favor
ably on the Measure.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 18.âJohn Muir.
the famous naturalist, whose tenderest
sentiments are intertwined with the
beauties of nature's great wonder spot,
the Yosemite Valley, appeared this af t
j ernoon before the joint meeting of tlw
Senate and Assembly committee hav
ing under consideration the bill for pro
viding for the recession of the valley
and the Mariposa Big Trees Grove to
the Federal Government. He pleaded
that the bill be passed and the Yo
semite be given back Into the care of
the nation. Other citizens of promi
nence made the same plea. To-morrow
the committees will report the bill fa
vorably in their respective houses, and
it seems- certain that it will become a
law.
Others who spoke for the recession
were Arthur R. Briggs, vice president
and manager of the California State
Board of Trade; William E. Colby, sec
retary of the Sierra Club; Warren Ol
ney. Mayor of Oakland; John G.
Northy, president of the California
Water and Forest Association; H. R.
McNoble of Stockton, a past grand
president of the Native Sons of the
Golden West; Miss* Mary Fairbrother,
representing the California Woman's
Club; Andrew P. Hill of San Jose, pres
ident of the SempervirenÃ Club; As
semhlymen Mitcheltree and Estudillo
and Senator Belshaw.
The only voice raised against the bill
was that of Senator Curtin, whose
principal objection was contained in
the fact that the recession of the tracts
would place ln the hands of the Fed
eral Government Improvements valued
at $241,000 without return. This argu
ment was answered by Senator Bel
shaw, however, who said that as the
State does not own the Yosemite Val
ley, holding it merely as trustee, its
title to the Improvements is not abso
lute, and, even were this the condition,
the improvements would be put to the
same uses in the future that they had
been in he past, and the object of the
' State in constructing them would be
fulfilled in any event. He further said
that, even though the State had put
this much money into permanent im
provements in the valley, it would be
returned by the Government in appro
priations it would make for betterment,
which would be money saved to Cali
fornia, and which, if the Government
did not take the reservation, must be
provided for by the State.
May Escape Special Investigation.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 18.âSenator
Emmons* resolution providing for an
investigation by a special committee
of the State Hospital for the Insane at
Napa, where 'Joseph R. Lewis, a pa
tient, recently met his death, it is al
leged, at the hands of two attendants,

It was agreed that the Committee on
Hospitals and Asylums should visit
the Napa institution and learn some
thing about conditions there.

BERLINDI AND
BAZELLI STAR
IN "MANON"
It is not often that I have the im
politeness to note what grand opera
has on. One doesn't usually care. Still,
there are times. Last night, with Mas
senet's "Manon," that the Tivoli put
on for the second time in San Fran
cisco, was one of them. The date of
the opera is 1721. Its people are the
powdered, pompadoured, polonaisud
folk of Watteau et al., eminently co
i quettish and dainty in garb. The first
I act of "Manon," however, might have
j been costumed from yesterday's rag
; bag, with here and there a* painfully
respectable tailored suit and even a
cravenette raincoat! â'tis true it rained
, cats, kittens and little dogÃ last night,
i But Manon herself, of the women, was
i the only person properly garbed. In
the fourth act âagain the third was
i cvt âthe costumed were in date but
| wonderfully Unsplendid, though not un
i soiled. They cried for gasolineâwe for
j a match. This kind of thing happens
jto matter in "Manon." The opera, spir
| ituelle, aristocratic, is elegance itself ln
; atmosphere. Costumed thus, it goes
' something like a butterfly on crutches.
I Fortunately, the chorus is frequently
i absent from the stage, and the Mar
senet atmosphere gets a chance. When
It does there is much of charm both for
eye and ear. The last time we heard
"Manon" the opera was sandwiched in
between the "Valkyries" and some
thing else equally massive. Its delicate
prettiness, aristocratic gayety and
suave, engaging measure were crushed
in the Wagnerian mill. Last night, in
| spite of the lack of sufficient rehearsal,
| the opera developed as a singularly
| pleasing work. It is light, but individ
j ual, French to the core, and contains
j much engaging melody and is orches
trated in peculiarly ingenious and tak
i ing fashion.
Berlindi, Bazelli and the orchestra
I were the stars of the performance."The
', extraordinary character of the work
, done by the Tivoli orchestra and its
! home and foreign annex is hardly done
credit to by its audiences. True, with
[ thi want of proper rehearsal the Work
has been much in the nature of
"stunts," brilliant but breathless. We,
no more than the orchestra, can draw
a quite full breath until it is through.
But last night's "Manon," so far as the
orchestra went, had a finish, an elas
ticity, a repose, that ln the circum
stances was wonderful. Signor . Pol
lacco's conducting has not so far been
seen to more distinguished and charac
teristic advantage.
Berlindi's Manon is one of the hits
of the season. She is a winsome lit
tle creature, her personality an in
creasingly attradtive quantity. As the
vain little French beauty she 1 was
equally charming and convincing. But
Berlindi was at her best ln the" scene
of Manon's temptation of her lover
turned priest. ' She furnished . every
reason for Dcs Grleux's capitulation.
There has been nothing so seductive
on the Tivoli stage since the Colla
marini Carmen. Miss Berlindi may
have a cold âmost of the singers have
discovered that we have a climateâ
but It was not apparent ln her fluent
and brilliant singing of the role.
Signor Bazelli came way up front

HEAVY RAINSTORM

Farmers Are Happy, as the Down
pour Will Prove of Great
Benefit to Them.
STOCKTON, Jan. 18.âA heavy rain
storm set in here this evening at 6
' o'clock, and there was a copious down
pour. It is worth a great deal of
money to the farming interests.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 18.âRain com
menced falling here at 5 p. m. and will
probably continue throughout the
night, to the great benefit of the val
ley. .
FRESNO, Jan. 18.âRain began fall
ing here to-night at 9 o'clock, and kept
up a steady downpour, with every
prospect of it continuing throughout
the night. The rain is a welcome one,
though there has been no suffering re-
I cently in the farming district for want
of showers. Grass ln the foothills and
grazing districts will be much bene
fited. Farmers are happy.

young- singer, his voice is young and
not trained In the best of schools.
When It comes to an Almaviva, with â 
its first song demanding all sorts of
tenor perfections, Signor Bazelli is not I
there. Last night, however, in a role
ln every way more "simpatica," the j
young tenor developed in surprising t
fashion. He sings with sometimes
exquisite taste and one quite forgave
the encore fiend for desiring to hear
again his charming "With Fancy's
Eye I Saw. Manon."
La Puma was also in the cast one
sees by the programme. With a voice
like the barytone's when he cares to

VACATION TIME
FOR STATESMEN
Members of the Lower House
Arrange for a Series of
Pleasant Junketing Trips
SHORT TOURS IN ORDER
Committees Will Enjoy Out
ings at the Expense of
Taxpayers of the State
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 18. âUnder
resolutions adopted by the Assembly
this morning many members of the
Lower House will enjoy pleasant jour- I
neys to various sections of the State
before the session ends. The flippant |
will probably refer to these as "jun- |
keting trips," but the statesmen who j
are to take them know them only as
"tours of investigation." The com
mittees on Public Buildings and
Grounds, Commerce and Navigation I
and State Hospitals and Asylums were
granted leaves of absence and per
mission to visit the places and institu
tions that will figure in the legislation
to be considered by them.
The Commerce and Navigation
Committee was the only one that had
any sort of a fight to carry its resolu
tion for a vacation. Assemblyman
Gus Hartman of San Francisco intro
duced it. It asked for leave of ab
sence from January 20 to January 26
and designated San Francisco, San
Diego and San Pedro harbors as the
points to be visited.
The various penal institutions of
the State, the hospitals for thd insane,
including that in Southern California
and the Veterans' Home ln Napa
County, will be visited.
Duryea said that if all the com
mittees, or ev)Sn two of them, should
go away at the same time it would be
hard to get a quorum of the House.
The Speaker said the chairmen of the
committees would so arrange the
dates as to prevent any such difficulty.
On Dorsey's motion a resolution was
adopted providing that not more than
two committees should be absent at
once. A resolution by Olmsted that
no member of more than one commit
tee should be allowed mileage more
than opce to any one section of the
State was also adopted.
The Assembly, after the introduc
tion of bills, among which were forty
code revision measures from Drew,
adjourned till to-morrow morning
at 10.
The Assembly smiled when Stanton
of Los Angeles introduced a bill pro
viding for "the better education of
practitioners of naturopathy." It was
a new one on the legislators. All per
sons acting as masseurs shall be
deemed to be practicing naturopathy
and shall take out licenses.
The bill providing for a State board
of three barber examiners w-as intro
duced in the House by Mitcheltree.
Whiting introduced a bill providing
for the appointment of an inspector of
mines at a salary of $3000 a year and a
deputy at $8 a day while actually em
ployed.
Branstetter introduced a measure
carrying an appropriation of $32,000
to protect the banks of the Eel River
from erosion by riprap and jetty work.
A bill providing for a public defender
to represent all persons charged with
felonies who are unable to employ
counsel was introduced by Assembly
man Houser. Under the proposed meas- I
ure the official shall be appointed for \
a term of two years and the scale of t
compensation ranges from $75 to $150 .
a month, according to the class of the i
counties. A similar bill was defeated j
at the last session.

a-
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan, 18.âAssembly
man Thomas" E. Atkinson of San Fran
cisco introduced in the House this
morning a bill intended te> suppress the
various "grafting" corporations and
companies that are now gathering in
shekels from the unsophisticated. The
bill provides for -the protection of in
vestors by deposits from the compa
nies and corporations coming under
the provisions of the act. The follow
ing portion of the act enumerates the
concerns affected by it:
. Every corppration. heretofore or hereafter
formed under the laws of this State or the
laws of any other State, Territory or foreign
country, and every person, firm or association
operating under any title, name or designa
tion other than e uch as shall disclose to the
public the full name of each and all the part
ners or associates interested therein, transact
ing business in this State aa a bond, bond in
vestment, debenture, diamond, tontine, indem
nity, guaranty or benefit company, or any
company or association formed for or with
the idea of raising its circulating capital, in
vestment or operating fund or funds, or the
equivalent thereof, by the sale l or disposal of
its own bonds, debentures, investment cer
tificates, contracts or other choses In action,
Or the bonds, debentures, investment certifi
cates, contracts or other choses In action of
any other person, firm association or corpora
tion, and not licensed by nor under the super
vision of the Bank Commissioners, Building
and Loan Commissioners or Insurance Com
missioners, must, as a prerequisite for the
future transaction of business in this State,
deposit, with the State Treasurer the sum of
ten thousand dollars.
It is also provided In the bill that all
the concerns enumerated shall file with
the Secretary of State, thirty days after
the close of the fiscal year, a detailed
statement, and shall pay a fee of $25
for the first $50,000 of capital and $20
for each additional $50,000. All moneys
so collected shall go into the State
treasury and form a fund to be known
as the tontine and debenture fund.
Assemblyman Atkinson, who is an
expert accountant, has not forgotten
that 'craft in framing the bill. As a
further check on the illegal operations
of such of these concerns as may be
of a dubious nature the proposed act
contains the following:
Within thirty days after the filing of any
such annual' report by any sucN incorporation,
person, firm or association "the Secretary of
State shall designate some qualified disin
terested public accountant to make a full and
complete expert examination of the affairs and
business of such corporation, person, firm or
association snd to report the result ln writing.
Such report shall be placed with the annual
report and both shall be open to public In
spection during business hours. All expenses
of such expert examination. Including travel
ing and hotel expenses anA a per diem of
not exceeding fifteen dollars for each day of
six hours, shall be paid by the corporation,
person, firm or association so examined and
a duplicate of the bill of expenses shall ac
company the report of the public accountant.
MAY INDORSE SONNTAG.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 18.âThe San
Francisco Senatorial delegation met
this afternoon to consider what action
if any it should take regarding the
appointment of a member of the
Board of State Prison Directors. A
majority of "the members expressed
themselves as favoring the indorse
ment of Colonel Charles Sonntag of
San Francisco, but the delegation de
cided to defer action until a future
date, as some opposition was mani
fested.
The delegation will support the.
bills to raise the salaries of San Fran
cisco Superior Judges to $6000 and
of Justices of the Peace to $3600.

Harry C. Riddle, the first witness, de
clared that a re-checklng of the regis

STONE SCORES
THE PRESIDENT
Attacks Roosevelt's Attitude
During the Campaign on
the Trusts' Contributions
WANTS INVESTIGATION
Missouri Senator Includes j
Root and Cortelyou mi
His Heated Arraignment!
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.âThe charges
lof Impropriety made in connection
j with the campaigns of 1836 and WO4
j were revived for a time to-day in the
j Senate by Stone of Missouri, who spoke
in support of his resolution providing
! for an investigation of the charges. Tie
j used with much freedom the names of
! President Roosevelt, Judge Parker and
i Chairman Cortelyou, and again related
I the allegations that Cortelyou had used
j the information secured by him as
J Secretary of Commerce and Labor to
! secure money from the trusts. In part
ihe said:
These charges have been made by Alton B.
| Parker and Thecdore Roosevelt. They are not
; vague, irresponsible campaign, rumors; . they
nre deflnit* charircs. We cannct ignore them.
Let the ln\> ftifcalion go on. If the Demo
i cratic party has also been recreant, if it also
iis guilty of this monstrous crime against good
; ffovcrnment. let it suffer the consequences.
I "Hew to the line; let the chip-* fall where
! they may."
To what level have We fallen if the Ameri
can rm< :>!Â» cat! look upon such conduct with
i complaisance? Aye and to .what level have
jwe fallen i" the American Senate can contem
i plate this natl.-nal shame with indifference?
I The confession mad* by the President and
j Mr. Root is monstrous. There is no need to
I decry or condemn It; It speaks for Itself.
j Taking up the charge made during
the campaign that Cortelyou had used
; his secret official information as a Cab
; met officer to secure contributions,
j Stone said he could neither affirm nor
! deny â¢'this terrible indictment," be
j cause he did not know. He added:
I only know that the damning admission
j stand.- that the trusts did supply Mr. Cortelyou
I with rampaifn funds. Mr. CortMjou has never
I made answer to this charge. Why Mr. Cortel-
I you stands dumb under this dishonoring ar
! ralgnment I will not conjecture. That man
'is said to be wise who knows how and when
Ito hold his tongue. Perhaps the good name of
I the country would have be-n better served If
j the President anil Mr. Root also had sought
shelter under the same kindly wing of si
! ence.
Mr. President, it is hard to beliÂ«ve that Mr.
I Cortelyou, or any man of character, would
I prostitute official opportunity to partisan ends
jso ba>Â«. I am loth to believe it; and yet a
i charge so Â«peeiflc as this anj which sj ileÂ»nlv
' concerns the public honor and welfare cannct
â be silenced by contemptuously pooh-poohing
! and ignoring it.
I Why dtii the President selet th's inex
| perlenced new convert to Tje head of his party
I organization. This accusing fact will not
) down, that the trusts did fill Mr. Cortelyou's
j campaign coffers to overflowing. Happily, we
J have the eomTorUnx assurance, vouchsafed by
j both Mr. Root and the President, that thÂ»
! trusts had no Improper motive in making these
! contributions an.i that no Improper means were
j usÂ«-d to Induce tl-.em.
The country is asked to believe, but no
i doubt it innocently will and does, thst the
I trusts brought their gold to Cortelyou out of
i purely unselfish snd patriotic considerations
! snd that they expect nothing In return. These.
I indeed, wer- virtuous trusts and theirs is an
! idealistic self-SK-rlflclng- patriotism. They
! scorned all base expectations of favors to come
'â  and scouted the very thought that their gold
! would be vsfd to corrupt!
Stone also expressed the opinion that
the President's charges against the
Democratic campaign management
1 should be Inquired Into. He based his
: demand for an inquiry into the cam
-1 paign of 1896 on the allegations df
j Thomas W. Lawson. made in a recent
magazine article Concluding, he said:
Theodore Roosevelt Is instinctively an honest
man. Rut he Is also ambitious, and I have
thought that ambition had so blurred his nat
' ural honesty .as to blind him momentarily and
j to make him do things or suffer things to be
i done that would otherwise hive been repulsive.
I I prefer to believe the beit of him. and. all
! things considered, the best I can believe Is that
! the President. beinÃ- an honest man, smarting
! under the sting of remorse and being himself
i no longer interested in campaign contributions,
hns resolved unselfishly to exert his strength to
promote the public welfare in this behalf.

LOS ANGELES EDITORS
ARE FINED FOR CONTEMPT
County Grand Jurors Complain That
Articles Were Published With
Intent to Intimidate Them.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 18. âGeneral
Harrison Gray Otis and his son-in
law. Harry Chandler, owners and pub
lishers of a Los Angeles morning news
paper, were fined $500 each by Judge
Wilber in the Superior Court to-day
for publishing articles alleged to re
flect on the action and motives of the
recent County Grand Jury.
The case is a very unusual one. The
defendants claimed that their publica
tion was a privileged one. that it was
the province of the public press to
comment freely upon the acts of the
Grand Jury and that any effort to un
duly restrict criticism would be an
abridgment of the rights of the press.
The court, however, found them guilty
and imposed the fines. The case will
be appealed.
The alleged offense was; brought to
the attention of the court by the mem
bers of the Grand Jury, who filed af
fidavits setting forth that the publica
tion of the articles complained of was
Intended to intimidate them.

Head of Utah University Says
Polygamous Marriages Are
No Longer Recognized
WASHINGTON. Jan. 18.âProfessor
James E. Talmage of the Utah State
University, author of some of the doc
trines accepted as authoritative teach
ings in the Mormon church, was on the
stand all to-day in the Smoot investi
gation before the Senate Committee on
Privileges and Elections. He gave an
interesting account of the church or
ganization and church courts and
proved to be well informed on nearly
every subject of church policy. He will
continue his testimony to-morrow.
As to polygamy. Professor Talmage
said plain English would have to be in
terpreted far differently than the con
struction he placed on the marriage
revelation to infer that there is any
thing mandatory about it. He said
there is not-one paragraph in the reve
lation tliat coptains an inference that
polygamy should be mandatory except
upon one manâthe Prophet Josephâ
and in all other cases polygamy was
permissive. At the death of the
Prophet Joseph the command contained
in the revelation descended to his suc
cessor, according to the construction
placed on Mormon doctrines by the
witness.
Celestial marriage, explained the wit
ness, means a marriage for time and
eternity, or for eternity only. The wit
ness stated that any woman who be
came', a plural wife of a man since Oc
tober 6, 1890, is no more a wife under
the rules of the church than she is in
ths eyes of the law.
Professor Talmage said he had par
ticipated in or witnessed the endow
ment ceremonies between one and two
score times. He denied that the alleged
"oath of vengeance" reported by cer
tain witnesses for the protestants is a
part of the ceremony and said further
that no "oaths" are taken in the cere
mony.
The witness, on cross-examination,
said he believed that any woman who
became a plural wife since the mani
festo was technically unchaste. He
said he knew of no such marriages and
tha|t no proof had been offered that
Abram Cannon had married Lillian
Hamlin in 1896. If such a marriage had
taken place the witness thought Can
non had put the wrong interpretation
on the manifesto.'

The trial of Lemuel D. Campbell, who
shot his wife to deatn some months
ago, was on, and the aged mother was
the principal witness. During the en
tire day she defended her daughter
against the Intent of the defense to try
to hide behind alleged misdoing.
An effort was made to show, upon
cross-examination, that Campbell had
discussed the past of his wife the even
ing the shooting occurred and that
Campbell had been invited to the house
to discuss a reconciliation.
Mrs. Cutler denied that her child's
character had been brought up In.the
conversation. She said that Campbell
wanted Laura to go back to him and
she answered "You are still mine for
three days," meaning that an Interloc
utory decree granted her had not yet
become final. Probed from every side
as to all that occurred or was said that
night Mrs. Cutler told her story and
stuck to it. She did not fall to deny the
Insinuations made against her daugh
ter's character.
The plan of the defense has been
clearly outlined ln the cross-examina-
tion of the mother, the most important
witness for the people. From questions
asked the mother it is evident that
Campbell will attempt to show that his
wife had been leading an Improper life.
Her past will be brought into the case,
and the shooting is to be made the se
quel of the quarrel.
SUPPOSED BURGLAR SEIZED
AND HURRIED TO PRISON
Inoffensive Bootblack Roughly Han
dled by Lodgers, Who Thought
They Had Captured a Thief.
OAKLAND. Jan. 18.âCours Cer
vera, a harmless Greek bootblack, was
mistaken for a burglar this morning
before daylight in a lodging-house at
Seventeenth street and San Pablo ave
nue, set upon by half a dozen awaken
ed lodgers, felled by numerous fist
blows, roped hands and feet and held
until the police were called in hot
haste. The badly frightened prisoner
was hauled to the City Jail, where
Captain of Police Petersen confronted
the man.
Cervera excitedly and brokenly ex
plained that he had gone to the house
to rent a room. He had wandered
through the halls ln search of the
landlord, when he was suddenly seized.
The prisoner made matters worse by
flying into a spasm of terror, which
was mistaken for resistance. He could
not explain himself in English and
helplessly submitted to capture.
Captain Petersen discharged the un
fortunate bootblack after his identity
and good character had been estab
lished.

SENT TO JAIL
Children's Fight Over an
Estate Ends in Arrest of
One for Embezzlement
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 18.
Owing to a quarrel among the chil
dren of the late Jose Levelra of San
Leandro over the estate left by him,
George Levelra, the favored son, Is now
ln Jail at Martinez charged with the
embezzlement of 123,000 of his father's
estate. Owing to his incarceration, he
did not appear in Judge Ogden's court
to-day in answer to a summons to ap
pear for examination as to his knowl
edge of the wealth supposed to have
been left by the father.
Some years ago the late Jose Leveira
and his wife quarreled. She sued him
for divorce and was granted her de
cree. He offered her $11,500 as a com
promise, and when she refused he col
lected a $10,000 mortgage and with
about $5000 additional money left the
country. He went to Honolulu, where
he remained twenty months, and then
came back and died recently at Marys
ville. There are eleven children. Seven
sided with their mother, four with the
father. Martin, on the mother's side,
as soon as he learned of his father's
death, got out special letters of admin
istration on the estate, but so far has
not been abls to unearth any of the
money.
The charge is now made that George,
who lives near Antioch. was in con
stant communication with the father,
and that he has the money. According
to a statement made by Attorney Cary
Howard, representing George, he,
George, was summoned Into Martinez
on Monday from Brentwood, and when
he got there a demand for $23,000 was
made upon him by his brothers. Fall
ing to produce it, he was thrown into
jail.
The hearing here has been continued
until the charge at Martinez has been
disposed of.

SOIL QUESTION
PUZZLES THEM
University Agriculturists
Asked to Help Save the
California Celery Lands
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 18.
Fearful that the soli composing the
peat beds of Southern California,
where grows the big celery crop of the
State, is deteriorating, men of the
south have sent samples of earth to
the agricultural department of the
State University for analysis in the
hope that remedies may be suggested
for the salvation of the great industry.
Professor Loughridge to-day re
ceived the soil samples, sent by C. W.
Cole of Santa Ana, Orange County.
Professor Loughridge believes that the
trouble with the soil in the peat bed
district Is due to the presence of too
much lime. This lime, he explains,
is likely to prove Injurious to the
celery crop if it has become a pre
ponderating element in the soil.
When Professor Loughridge has
concluded his tests the celery-growers
of the State will be provided with data
that may either reveal a method of
treating the soil to preserve its fer
tility or declare to them the hopeless
ness of seeking to change the condi
tions there.

TEACHER'S IRE
University Professor Tells
Students Their Errors
Are Really Extraordinary
PAGE BLOWS A BLAST
Prominent Instructor Cites
Answers He Received to
Examination Questions
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Jan- 18.
Declaring: that the standard of schol
arship In his classes last term was so
low as to provoke astonishment, Pro
fesor Thomas Walker Page to-day
scored his class ln medieval history,
consuming ten minutes in a verbal ex
coriation of the luckless seekers after
knowledge.
Professor Page gave It as his opinion
that if the University of California's
rating as an institution depended in
the slightest degree upon the showing
pupils in his department made last
term, as revealed in the examination
papers he had read, the university
would be ln a most unenviable plight,
and likely to deserve the rank of a
very Inferior institution, instead of a
first-rate university. The examination
papers, he said, showed a most amaz
ing lack of knowledge on the part of
students, and , ln some instances were
so weird as to excite mirth and ridi
cule.
Professor Page is an important figure
in the university's history department.
His specialty Is medieval history. His
examination questions naturally re
lated to medieval subjects. It was in
this field that his students floundered
and became mired, many of them trying
to give suitable answers to such ques
tions as: "What were the relations be
tween church and state in France in
the reign of Charlemagne?" or "What
features distinguished the reign in Rus
sia of Nicholas I?"
The indignant professor read off a
number of these questions to-day, with
answers that had been supplied by stu
dents on the examination papers sub-
mitted by them, and begged the class
to consider what extensive lack of
knowledge must have prompted the in
congruous answers given to many of
the questions.
"Under the circumstances," said ths
professor, "it became my painful duty
to disqualify many of the students in
my class last term for these amazing
blunders."
Thus did Professor Page account, in
part at least, for the 204 "cinches" suf
fered by university students last term.

OAKLAND. Jan. 18. âWhen the heavens un
expectedly opened their gates this afternoon
and deluged the city Just as a brilliant Oakland
Club function was drawing to a close, the in
genuity of lovely woman was put to it to pre
serve her glad raiment from an unhallowed
baptism. Cabs and other public vehicles of
that description are always sadly lacking when
they are needed most, and 150 or more women
faced the serious problem of dry transportation
through a pouring rain. When the few car
riages procurable had carried the lucky ones
away there were still dozens of anxious, dain
tily clad women facing a sure drenching. Then
some Inventive fair one got a newspaper, and,
pinning it artistically over her headpiece of
chiffon and plumes, bravely started out. In a
short time other similar hat coverings had
been fashioned and the "newspaper brigade,"
aa one witty club woman dubbed them, marched
courageously through the storm.
The luncheon which was the nucleus of this
gay gathering 10-day was one Â»f the largest
the Oakland Club haa yet entertained. Mrs.
T. P. Hogan was chief hostess andthad planned
a Spanish-American day that proved to be
very pleasant in every way. The red and yel
low of Spain was intermingled artistically with
the stars and stripes, and the color* of the two
countries were also shown ln the floral decora
tions.
During the afternoon Rev. Dr. F. X. Morn
son gave an informal talk and there was an
interesting programme of music, participated
in by Miss Marion Howard Filtcn, Miss An

SIX BOLTERS
GO TO KERENS
Missouri Legislators Fail
to Abide by Verdict
of Senatorial Caucus
JEFFERSON CITT, Mo., Jan. 18.â
The bolt of six Republicans on the first
and two more on the second ballot from
the ranks of Niedringhaus, the Repub
lican nominee for United States Sena
tor to succeed Francis M. Cockrell.
whose election had seemed assured, re
sulted in no choice to-day. With the
exception of one, who cast his ballot I
for Dr. Pettijohn of Lynn County, all
the bolters voted for Richard C. Ker
ens of St. Louis, who was the strongest
opponent of Niedringhaus in the cau
cus.
Immediately after the second ballot
the joint session adjourned unti\ to
morrow, when balloting will be re- I
sumed at noon. The second ballot re- j
suited as follows: Niedringhaus 85, 1
Cockrell 83, Kerens 7. Pettijohn L
On the first ballot Niedringhaus re
ceived 87 votes, two less than the num
ber required for election; Cockrell re
ceived 83 and Kerens 6.
Interesting developments are expect
ed to-morrow. Claims are made by
the anti-Niedringhaus forces that fif
teen votes will be taken from the Nied
ringhaus strength to-morrow. They
say that, having voted for him twice
on joint ballot, the pledged members
have done their duty and are now free
to go to another candidate and, if
necessary, to Join ln a call another
caucus on a Senatorial nominee.

Indiana School Teacher
CONFESSION ALLEGED
Men Reported to Have KiUed
Miss Schaefer of Bedford*
Using Bock as a Weapon
BEDFORD, Ind., Jan. 18.âFrank
Evans and William Elmer Browning
were arrested to-day on warrants
sworn out by John D. Underwood, an
attorney, charging them with the mur
der of Miss Sarah S. Schaefer on the
night of January 21, 1904:
The arrest Is due to a story told by
Mrs. Cook, the divorced wife of Brown
ing. According to her story her hus
band, from whom she was at the time
separated, told her that he and Evans
had killed Miss Schaefer. In the' con
fession, she says he made to her, he
said that he and Evans had planned
to assault Miss Schaefer. The two
met at the alley and as the girl passed
Browning struck her on the head with
a slungshot, stunning her. Evans
caught her and carried her Into the
cab shed, where with a rock he struck
her a blow on the forehead which re
sulted in her death.
Evans changed his clothing, giving
the blood-stained garments to Brown
ing with instructions to bury them.
Browning gave them to his wife, who
hid them where, it is said, they were
found a few days ago. Among the
clothing is a coff with a button said to
match one which was found in the cab
shed a day or two after the murder.
Miss Schaefer was a teacher In the
local high school.

New Member of Police Board
Placed at Its Head With
the Aid of His Own Vote
Police Commissioners Hutton and I
Reagan anounced last night that they ;
were still opposed to private rooms in !
French restaurants. Beds must be re- !
moved and the doors between rooms I
must be taken out, they declared,
â¢. Though the other two Commissioners
voted in favor of renewing the liquor
.â¢ licenses, the negative carries in case of
.. â¢ . a tie and it looks very much as if the 1
private rooms must go. The Bay State
. restaurant, Delmonico's and the old
â¢ Poodle Dog pleaded, through Attor- :
ney Abe Ruef, that their cases go over, '
but this was denied. The resorts are
. . now running without licenses.
Commissioner Poheim was elected
president of the Board of Police Com
â¢ missioners. He voted for himself and
received the ballots of Reagan and
Drlnkhouse.
When the cases of Sergeants Ellis,
'Brophy and Fraher, against whom I
..'Hutton. preferred charges, were called 1
a letter from Foreman Andrews of the
Grand Jury was read asking that the |
hearing by the Commissioners be again i
â¢postponed. The Grand Jury expects
to complete Its investigations in an
other week and the foreman asks that
nothing be done to interfere with the
' work of the Inquisitorial body.
Though Poheim objected, the case
of Ellis is to be taken up a week from
: to-morrow and those of the others
were postponed for two weeks.
George Villanos, who conducts a
â¢ restaurant at 1522 Market street,
created a little scene when ordered to
remove the curtains in his place. "1

ADVERTISEMENTS.
THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char
cal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, out
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you â¢ take of it the better; it is not a j
drug at all, but simply absorbs the I
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
roilect in the stomach and bowels; It
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best ,
charcoal and the most for the money
la in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges: they j
are' composed of the finest powdered ,
Wiliow charcoal, and other harmless |
antiseptics in tablet form or rather ln
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
hopey.-
The daily use of these lozenges will
"soon tell in a much Improved condition
of the general health, better complex
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of It is, that no possible
harm can result from their continued
.â¢use. but on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas In stom
ach and bowels, and to clear the com
plexion and purify the breath, mouth
and throat: I also believe the liver is
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them; they cost but 25 cents a box at -
drug stores, and although in some sense :
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal in Stuart's j
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

HUE RESENTS GIBE
BERATES CAUCASIAN MATRON
Alleges Deep - Seated Conspiracy
to Effect Her Removal.
Disclaiming pretension of possessing
the sweetest temper on earth. Miss
Jeanette Clark opined that even the
person so equipped could not have
passively submitted to the indignities
which provoked her to address un
complimentary language to Mrs. Ma
thilda Stone of 2221 Beach street, be
tween Broderick and Baker, and with
in stonethrow of the Presidio reserva
tion. Although she had never at
tempted to mingle with the Caucasian
ladies of that vicinage, Miss Clark
averred, there was obviously a con
spiracy on their part to impel her to
remove to a more agreeable neighbor
hood. Every time she walked abroad,
at.
'payin' no 'tenshun ter nobuddy," her
earn were assailed by taunting allu- J
sions to her complexion, which was
naturally of chocolate hue, and Irri
tating comments on her figure, which
was willowy. To these oral persecu
tions was added the mimicking of her
gait by female children, whose ribaldry
probably was prompted by their femi
nine relatives. It was a series of sting
ing remarks uttered by Mrs. Stone that
brought upon that lady's head the
vials of Miss Clark's pent-up wrath.
"She sed mo'n er saint cud stan',"
Miss Clark informed Police Judge Mo
gan. "en Ah'll 'fess dat Ah did han'
back sum wahm wuds. Ef mah 'plex

en den Ah sed dat mah cullah

"But she alleges that you said words
more offensive than those," his Honor
remarked. â¢
"Den whafo' she ruffle mah fedders

"What do you mean by 'pestered'?"
inquired an inquisitive attorney for the
prosecution.
"Ah means dat Ah'm called names
Ah doan lak?"
"Anastasla Johnson, for instance?"
"Yessah, en wussn't dat."
A group of matrons were ready and
willing to substantiate Mrs. Stone's
averment fhat Miss Clark was a com
mon scold, whose vituperation was
ever on tap; also to deny the existence
of any such conspiracy or malicious
drawing of the color line as the de
fense alleged. But a pressure of more
important matter compelled the court
to postpone the taking of their testi
mony until next week.

"The very idea," said Miss Violet

and confronting Judge Mogan, "of

Then she sniffed defiantly at D. O,

house furnishers, who proceeded to in
form the court that Miss Stevens had
obtained from him certain goods by
false pretenses, said goods consisting
of one fancy clock, two statuettes and
two floor rugs, of the total value of
$23. It was on her representation that
she was furnishing a suite of apart
ments on Ellis street that he delivered
the goods and accepted her written
promise to pay for the in easy
installments. When he went to collect
the first installment he discovered that
she had left the Ellis-street house, neg
lecting to leave either the goods or any
clew as to where she had taken them,
and after infinite trouble he traced her
to a Market-street lodging-house, and
there effected her arrest. No, he did
not remember of whom the statuettes
were counterfeit presentments in min
iature, but was inclined to believe that
neither of them was modeled on the
physical lines of Battling Nelson, nor
did he think that either of them was
fashioned to Immortalize Nan Patter

Miss Stevens vouchsafed the Infor

The incident occurred at the front door
of Mrs. Boxald's residence, 608 Baker

suance of his vocation as collector for

"Was the battery conducted in si-

STRIKE RANKS
GAIN RECRUITS
Suspension of Work at
Russian Shipyards Dis
astrous to War Plans
SPREAD OF MOVEMENT
Construction of Submarine
Boats on the Neva Yards
Comes to a Standstill
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 18.âThe
strike situation is becoming very grave.
To-night 58,000 men are out on strike,
and the movement is spreading to the
bis cotton mills, which employ more
than 50,000 operatives. Meetings have
been called for to-morrow, at which the
Socialistic Democratic leaders will use
their utmost endeavors to convert the
strike into a vast political demonstra
tion, which at the present crisis might
have most serious developments. The
authorities are adopting every precau
tion to avoid an outbreak, but the So
cialist Democrats are spurring on the
strikers, and there is great danger of a
collision with the troops, which would
be almost sure to be followed by a red
flag demonstration, accompanied with
great bloodshed.
Early to-day the employes of the Neva
Shipbuilding Works decided to support
the strikers of the Putiloff and Franco-
Russian works. Subsequently 12,000 of
the men of the Neva works informed
their managers that they had gone out
on a general strike.
The strike at the Neva works in
volves the suspension of the con
struction of submarine boats, which
was being carried out under the super
vision of an American engineer, and
also the work on two ocean-going ves
sels similar to those of the volunteer
fleet, and several gunboats and tor
pedo-boats, besides the preparation of
war material urgently required for
naval and military purposes.
Following are the demands of ths
Putiloff works strikers:
FirstâThe dismissal of tbe foreman, who
is objected to by the union, and the reinstate
ment of the men who were dismissed for be
longing to the union.
SecondâEight hours' work per day.
ThirdâThe valuation of work to be mads by
a joint committee of workmen and foremen.
FourthâThe appointment of a Joint perma
nent committee of arbitration.
FifthâA minimum wag* of 60 cants per day
for unskilled male labor.
Sixth âOvertime work not to b* obligatory,
and to be paid for at double rates.
SeventhâThe men not to bear the cost of
condemned work when not responsible for It.
EighthâA minimum wage of 35 cents per
day for unskilled female labor, and th* es
tablishment of a creche for children.
Ninth âImproved mediaal attendance.
Tenthâlmproved sanitary' conditions in tmm
workshops, especially In the smithies.
Eleventhâlmmunity from punishment for
strikers.
TwelfthâThe average rate of pay during
the strike.
It is reported that the Social Demo
crat faction did not show great
strength at the meetings to-night and
the anti-Radii als are greatly encour
aged at the apparent determination of
the majority of the strikers to confine
their contest-to trade issues.
ESSEN SITUATION GRAVE.
ESSEN, Germany, Jan. 18.âThe sit
uation in the coal mining districts is
becoming more serious daily. The num
ber of strikers officially reported now
reaches 185,000, which is more than
double,the number who quit work in
Germany's great strike in 1889. The
negotiations of the Government Com
missioners thus far promise nothing
favorable, although the number of
commissioners was" increased to-day by
three arrivals from Berlin.
To-day's conference .at Dortmund
with representatives of the Mine-Own
ers' Association lasted until 1 o'clock.
It had been hoped that the conference
would lead to a settlement of the strike,
but these hopes have been completely
dashed, since the representatives of the
Mine-Owners* Association refused even
to take part in the joint conference
with delegates from the Mine Opera
tives' Union, which had been planned
for to-morrow.
Provincial President Hasse. who at
tended the conference, returned to
night to Coblentz and intimated that
the Government authorities regard the
situation as serious.
Everything now indicates that the
strike will be a long and bitter one.
The question Is, how long the miners
can hold out. Next week they will re
ceive the pay for work done ln De
cember and part of January. This,
with contributions coming in. It is
thought, will be sufficient for five weeks
at least. Government officials are be
ginning to admit that the strike will
last a long time, and are taking meas
ures accordingly to prevent outbreaks.
In some towns th* police have ordered
that saloons be closed at an early hour.
Reports from various parts of the
country indicate a great disturbance
of trade owing to the lack of coal. The
textile mills and cement concerns on
the lower Rhein are already running
partly short time.

CONTRABAND ON BOARD
Forty-Eight Ships Now on
High Seas With Cargoes
for Belligerent Ports
TOKIO, Jan. 18.âJapanese cruisers
captured the British steamship Bawtry
in Tsu Straits yesterday morningr. The
vessel was carrying provisions, ship
building materials, etc., from Kiao
chau, the German port on the Shan
tung Peninsula, to Vladivostok. She
was taken to Sasebo.
The capture of another steamship is
reported, but no details have been re
ceived.
LONDON, Jan. 18.âMuch bsuiness
was done at Lloyd's to-day on vessels
bound for the Far East with cargoes
consigned to belligerent ports. Forty
eight steamships are now on their way
to the extreme Orient, a number of
which going to Vladivostok were re
insured at 50 guineas per cent. The
British steamships Powder ham and
Oakley, both of which sailed from
Barry, the former on November 12 and
the latter on January L whose owners
have already lost vessels by capture,
were reinsured at 75 guineas per cent
each.
Another transaction vhich was re
garded as significant was the Issuance
of sixteen Hamburg-American Line
j vessels covering war risks only, for the
j voyage from a port in the United
Kingdom* to a port not east of Colom
| bo, Ceylon, and return and at an ex
! ceedingly low premium. It is under
| stood that each vessel will carry coal.
| The transaction created much talk on
i the floor of Lloyd's, where it was con
fidently believed that the Hamburg-
American vessels will act as feeders
for Admiral Rojestverisky's squadron
in the event of it being ordered to re
turn to European waters.
SHANGHAI, Jan. 18.âThe British
steamship Powderham, which sailed
from Barry, England, on November 12
for Vladivostok, has entered the port
her crew refusing to pro

ture by the Japanese.
WARSHIPS NEAR BORNEO.
MANILA, Jan. 18.âAdvices reach
ing Manila say that two Russian
cruisers recently called at the island
of Labuan, near Borneo. Two Jap
anese cruisers had been in the same
port for coal and provisions, but they
, did not meet the Russian vessels. The
! latter, it is reported, came from Bra
; zil, by way of the Straits of Magel
, lan.
! A dispatch from St. Petersburg on
January 15 said some of the newspa
pers there claimed that the Japanese
were using the island of Labuan as a
base and mat the British were con
cealing the fact by preventing com*
munication between Borneo and Sin

was undergoing repairs.

Louis Ezell's bay horse W. R. Con
' don. with Anderson on his back, scored j
a skyrocket win of the $1000 handicap ;
over one and one-sixteenth miles yes- |
terday at Oakland. There were only
; five starters, and Mike Daly's Elliott.
carrying Bullman and 111 pounds, had j
the call at 9 to 5.
â ' W. R. Condon opened up at threes, j
"but toward post time a world of coin j
dme to light, forcing the price down .
to 11 to 5. The start was ragged, Oro |
â¢ Viva and Veterano getting away poor- ,
lyr Condon sailed out in the lead, and !
'. It looked as if both Bullman, on Elliott,
â  and Davis, astride Bombardier, had j
waiting orders. Bullman tried to over
haul the leader the last quarter, and
failed dismally, for Condon laughed in '
â¢.by a couple of lengths. Davis, with
Bombardier, couldn't help being third, j
Rain fell almost incessantly and the
. track looked a sea of mud. Hainault
â¢ and Sea Spray were the only successful
favorites.
Brennus, the mount of Mysterious
Charley Bell, had first call in the bet
ting on the introductory Futurity I
course sprint. The gelding appeared j
â¢ sore and ran only a fair race, finishing
third. Hipponax, played from 6 to 1
d iwn to 23 to 5, with Alarle up, made all
the running and won hands down from
The Hawaiian, a 30-to-l shot. Lurene,
a backed one, apparently did not take
to the going.
On her previous two races M. D. Mil
.lf r l s three-year-old colt Sea Voyage
looked a cherry-ripe one for the five
and a half furlong sprint. Opening at |
'3, the filly's price dropped until 9 to 5
was the best, making her equal favorite
with Tarn O'Shanter. The latter met
with many mishaps on the back
stretth, finishing unplaced. Little Tay
lor, on Sea Voyage, got his mount away
.first and, outfonting St. George Jr., dis
posed of the Ferguson entry without
any great effort at the wire. Hulford
ran a fair third.
Bonner, astride Mr. Farnum, earned
a neck decision over Yellowstone, the
mount of Davis, at the close of the
rnlle and hundred yard selling fixture.
Yellowstone closed a point lower ln the
betting than the McCafferty horse and
made all the running. Mr. Farnum
was "the contender throughout," and
when Yellowstone began tiring at the
'paddock forged to the front. The show
went to G.in Spray.
Had" the track remained slow Modl
; 'rum might have won the mile and fifty
yard event. The downpour of rain left
a. hard bottom and the old cripple made
an indifferent showing. Hainault, the
â¢3 to 4 favorite, piloted by Davis, led
from the start, winning in a gallop from
:Major Tenny, an 18 to 1 shot. Modicum
was third.

Newport News, Va., July 22, 1903.
Last summer while recovering from ill
ness of fever, I had a severe attack of
lifflammatory Rheumatism in the knees,
from which I was unable to leave my
room for several months. I was treated
by two doctors and also tried different
kinds 'of linaments and medicines which
seemed to relieve me from pain for
awhile, but at the same time I was not
any nearer getting well. One day while
reading a paper I saw an advertisement
of S. S. S. for Rheumatism. I decided
to give it a trial, which I did at once.
, After I had taken three bottles I felt a
great deal better, and I still continued
to take it regularly until I was entirely
cured. I now feel better than for years, I

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. JANUARY 19, 1905.
BOATING CLUBS
ORDERED AWAY
Oakland Office "Ban Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 18.
The University of California Boating
Club, the Columbia Rowing Club and
the Oakland Canoe Club have been
served with notice to vacate the prop
erty they have long occupied at the
foot of Fifth avenue, facing the East
Oakland Basin Negotiations that have
been pending for the sale of twenty
five acres of that water front land to
the American Magnesite Company
have reached a point where the owner
of the land, the Oakland Harbor Devel
opment Company, has been obliged to
direct the clubs to withdraw. The for
mal notices were served by E. P. Van
dercook, secretary of the corporation,
the principal stockholder ln which is
James L. de Fremery.
For years the site occupied by the
clubs has been a headquarters for
aquatic sports on the estuary. The
three clubs own well-equipped houses
and have had a long undisturbed use
of the land. The encroachments of
manufacturing enterprises and the de
mand for available water frontage has
crowded out the old-timers and this
move Is only one of many that are ln
progress along the harbor front No
steps have as yet been taken by the
clubs to procure new locations. The
University Club is hopeful that its re
moval will not interfere with its annual
spring regatta, for which training will
shortly be commenced.
DOLE IS CHAMPION PUNTER
OF THE STANFORD ELEVEN
Is Awarded th e Cap Offered by tbe
Quadrangle Club to the Foot
ball Men.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 18.
W. H. Dole was to-day awarded the
punting cup, which Is given each year
by the Quadrangle Club to the best
punter during the football reason.
Average distance is what counts, and
Dole was far ahead of all contestants.
Coach Lanagan and Captain Clark
were the Judges. The punting cup
was not awarded last year because no
measurements were taken and conse
quently no decision could be made.
Dole comes from Riverside and is
a member of the large family of ath
letes that has brought fame to Stan
ford. He has played left halfback on
the varsity for three years and is con
sidered by many the best halfback
Stanford has ever produced. Although
outpunted ln the intercollegiate game
of last semester by Heitmuller of Cal
ifornia, Dole's kicking ln that con
test was remarkable.
Harrison Promoted.
A. S. Harrison, watchman for the
United States Immigrant Bureau, has

senger in the office.

GET ON TRAIL
OF A SUSPECT
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 18.âThe detec
tives of Wells, Fargo & Co. are
hot upon the trail of John A. Limos,
who is suspected of holding up the
Santa Fe train near Daggett on De
cember 5, 1904, and killing Express
Messenger Evan O. Roberts. Limos is
also suspected of being implicated in
other holdups that occurred in Napa
and Mendocino counties some years
ago. The Wells-Fargo agent at Ross
Station notified the main office at San
Francisco yesterday that a man an
swering the description of Limos had
been seen in the vicinity of Ross Val
ley. As Limos was formerly employed
near San Rafael and Is familiar with
the country, the detective department
gave credence to the report and dis
patched Officer White to the scene.
White visited Ross Valley this evening
and Interviewed some of the residents
who had seen the suspect. They were
shown Limos' photograph and were
positive that he was the man seen
Tuesday. Limos is said to have been
attired in fine raiment, but at the resi
dence of R J. Davis he asked the
Chinaman for a coat and something to
eat This was thought strange, as he
carried a heavy coat on his right arm.
He was careful to conceal his hand,
and the supposition is that he carried
a pistol in it ready to use ln case of
an emergency.
White says he does not think that
Limos was implicated ln the Daggett
robbery, but says he Is wanted on
other charges of highway robbery,
Limos Is well known ln Marin County,
having worked here on several ranches.
The last place he was employed was
near Novate Two years ago Limos
was suspected of holding up a stage
near Ukiah, ln Mendocino County.
Sheriff Taylor of Marin and Chief
Thacker of Wells-Fargo were on his
trail for many weeks, but he evaded
capture.
SUES BEE TAYLOR. âCharles B. Naylor,
one of the Original attorney* for Bee Taylor
ln the matter of her uncle's will, yesterday
sued her for 81600 for services rendered. Miss
Taylor created a scene ln Judge Troutt's court
last week by discharging her latest attorney.

SUE JOCKEY CLUB FOR
DAMAGES FOR EJECTMENT
Two Patrons of Oakland Track Al
lege That They Have Been Hu
miliated Several Times.
A difficulty between the New Cali
fornia Jockey Club and two of the pa
trons of its Oakland track Is indicat
ed in two complaints for damages
filed yesterday in the Superior Court
by Attorney Edward J. Hill. Andrew
Daiss demands $2111 90 as a balm for
the indignities and humiliations suf
fered by being ejected from the course
on December 30 and being denied ad
mission on the six succeeding racing
days. Each Instance is made the ba
sis of a separate demand and it is al
leged that the plaintiff had purchased
a ticket and was neither under the in
fluence of liquor, boisterous, nor a
person of objectionable character. The
other suit is by Ed Eckert, who was
thrice denied admission, and he asks
$300 for each refusal. In both cases
the men were ejected by the Pinker
tons under suspicion of having given
the results of the races to the pool
rooms.
STRIKE ENDED
AT FALL RIVER
BOSTON, Jan. 18.âThe strike of the
cotton-mill operatives at Fall River,
which affected about 25,000 persons and
has been in progress for six months, to
the great hardship and suffering of the
Fall River people, was Bettled to-day
through the mediation of Governor
William L. Douglas.
The agreement accepted was framed
by the Governor and was submitted to
each side by him when the parties met
to-day. After some discussion in sep
arate rooms the committees returned
to the Governor's office and announced
their acceptance of the proposition, the
full text of which follows:
The strike to be declared off and the op
eratives to return to work at once. All op
eratives to be put to work ln the mill ln
which they were employed when the strike be
gan as fast as possible and no discrimination
to be shown on account of the present strike.
After resumption of work I (Governor Doug
las) will take up and Investigate the matter
of margin and submit to you my conclusion
M to what average margin shall prevail, on '
which the manufacturers are to pay a dividend
of 6 per cent on wages earned from the present
time to AprU 1. 1900.
It is agreed by both parties that the margin
fixed by me shall In no way prejudice future
wage schedules.
The proposition accepted to-day was
practically the same as that which the
Governor presented at last Saturday's
conference and which was not accepted '
then because the manufacturers' com
mittee was not empowered to take the
step.
After the meeting both sides ex
pressed satisfaction over the outcome.
The operatives will begin going back
to work to-morrow.
FALL RIVER, Mass., Jan. 18.âThe
news of the settlement of the long- j
pending mill strike was received in this I
city with great enthusiasm. The strike
was directly due to a reduction of 12%
per cent ln wages. The mills had re
duced wages 10 per cent eight months
previously.
The mills affected by the strike have
a' combined capital of $25,000,000, and !
have 2,300,000 spindles. During the,
months the mills were shut down the i
operatives lost nearly $150,000 weekly. I
The aggregate direct losses to all inteiv- i
ests up to to-day Is estimated at fully i
$5,000,000.
Want Railway to Extend Route.
MARYSVILLE, Jan. 18.âSeveral
prominent residents of Smartsvllle are
negotiating to have the proposed
Grass Valley-Marysvllle Railroad run
via Smartsvllle and through the Ayer
tract. Engineers are now running
lines from the end of the electric car
tracks In Grass Valley to Spenceville
and from the latter place toward
Marysville. This route would leave
Smartsvllle ten miles or more from
the line.
Denies Application for Injunction.
NAPA. Jan. 18.âJudge Crawford
to-day denied the application of the
La France Fire Engine Company for
an injunction to restrain the city from
purchasing an engine from a rival
company. t
NELSON SEEKS
RETURN MATCH
Chicago Boxer Is Anxious
for Another Bout With
Jimmy Britt Next Month
OFFERS TO STOP HIM
Claims the Californian Can
not Stay Twelve Rounds
if Referee Is Impartial
Battling Nelson has returned from
his duck shooting pilgrimage to Gridley
and is already hot on the trail of Jimmy
Britt in quest of a return match. It
was given out that Nelson and Young
Corbett were matched, but the Battling
one denies this.
He feels so sure of his ability to de
feat Britt that he offers to bet $1000
that he can stop the Californian in
twelve rounds. He wants an impartial
referee. Nelson posted $5000 with Harry
Corbett yesterday to bind a match.
Nelson's prospective match with
Young Corbett has not been definitely
arranged. The Chicago man claims
Corbett Is a harder hitter than Britt
and, according to his point of view, a
more dangerous opponent. He also be
lieves Britt the better drawing card,
hence his anxiety to get him into the
ring again.
Britt has invested $30,000 ln a row of
modern fiats on the northwest corner
of Fell and Fillmore streets. Britt's
first professional battle was fought on
February 18, 1902, since which date he
has appeared eleven times in the ring.
This money represents only a part of
his savings during this period.
Ah Wing, the picturesque Chinese
boxer who meets Manuel Torres before
the San Francisco Club in Woodward's
Pavilion to-morrow night, came from
Sacramento yesterday looking like a
mandarin with his flowing suit of blue
silks. With the Chinese came Kid
Christie, who is to box "Brick" Howard
in one of the preliminaries. Wing is
the only full-blooded Mongolian whb
ever took up the boxing game in
earnest and asked no favors of his op
ponents. He has a "cauliflower" ear
that attests the fierceness of his en
counters with the gloves. Manuel
Torres will box Wing.
Joe Carroll beat Tom Sullivan the
only time they met, but it was a close
decision and the loser was handicapped
by the "clean break" rules in vogue.
Sullivan has never been satisfied with
the decision and Carroll has agreed to
"straight" rules to-morrow night In
the wlndup of the show. Five other
bouts are carded as follows: Bob
Cairns vs. Mike Synfy, Harry Riley vs.
Billy Stanton, "Brick" Howard vs. Kid
Christie, George Sanfranson vs. Charlie
Dunn and Denny O'Connell vs. Jim
Bradley.
The initial boxing show of the Haw
thorne Athletic Club will be held in
Woodward's Pavilion on Friday even
ing, the 27th Inst. Manager Al Young
has prepared the following card: Lew
Powell vs. Bob Cairns, 135 pounds,
weigh in at ringside; Billy (Rough
house) McDonald vs. Frank Mayneld,
at 145 pounds; Jim Keegan vs. Pete
Sullivan, 135 pounds; Charles Dunn vs.
Willie Wolf, 133 pounds; George Curran
vs. Young Dempsey, 125 pounds; Harry
Baker vs. Ed Kehoe, 110 pounds, and
Harry Tenny vs. Frank Edwards, 115
pounds. Eddie Smith of Oakland will
referee all contests.

MANAGER PLANS
A BULL FIGHT
Full-Blooded Spanish Tor
eadors to Entertain the
Sports in -Madrid Style
NOT A GORY SPECTACLE
No Picadors, Matadors or
Knives Will Be in Evi
dence at Novel Combat
There will be a grand bullfight in
Woodward's Pavilion on the evening of
the 25th insL So much gore will be fly
ing that the spectators will be unable
to see the ring. The house will be
jammed full of people at $2 a head. The
foregoing is not a Joke, but simply a
dream of Morris Levy's and "Don Senor
Enrico Robles'."
Bills have been distributed announc
ing the approach of the momentous af
fair. Some of Levy's envious rivals in
the general combat business aver that
the Bush-street cars will be running
when a bullfight is promoted ln Wood
ward's Pavilion. Others think Captain
of Police Splllane will not have to take
along an extra large squad to keep the
mad throngs from breaking their necks
trying to put up the $2 for admission.
Secretary Holbrook of the Humane
Society will be on the scene with offi
cers, and if there is the least sign of
cruelty he promises to pinch the entire
outfit of promoters. It appears Robles
visited Holbrook several days ago and
explained that the bullfight would be
a humane affair.
Picadors and matadors will be num
bered with the missing, as will also the
caballos. No sort of a knife will be
exhibited. There will be one toreador,
Don Enrico himself. He will appear in
the ring clad in a picturesque Caatillan
costume, with a beautiful flowing sash.
Then some one will lead in a brindle
yearling from the opposite corner of
the ring. Don Enrico will advance,
valorously waving a section of red flan
nel shirt. After that the interest of the
spectators will be centered ln the
toreador's superhuman efforts to avoid
the deadly charges of the ferocious
beast. It is whispered along the line
that the next event on the programme
will be the mob-murder of the pro
moters.
Meanwhile Don Enrico Is trying to
escape the officers of the law and eats
rubber erasers to make himself agile,
while Levy is feeding the yearling ta
males to make it fierce.
WOMEN MEET AND FORM
A "COMMON SENSE CLUB"
Fair Athletes Are Making Ready to
Equip a Gymnasium in Good
Style.
More than seventy athletically in
clined women, young, middle aged and
old. met last night in Judge Sloss'
courtroom and formed an athletic
club to be known aa the "Women's
Common Sense Club." William Greer
Harrison, president of the Olympic
Club, was the star of the evening and
started proceedings with a speech that
brought forth applause as well as tit
ters and giggles.
Mr. Harrison advised the women to
get together and form a club that
; would be an athletic organization in
] the true sense of the word. He took a
decided stand against social festivi
ties in such a club and Informed the
ladles that as soon aa they went In
for sociability they would put the ath
letic part of the programme out of
commission ln record time. Mr. Har
rison gave the ladles some sound ad
vice ln regard to exercise, gymnasium
work and apparatus and suggested
that they commence on a â¢mall scale
and begin exercise without the aid of
apparatus.
After a temporary board of direc
tors had been chosen the meeting ad
journed to meet again at tbe call of
| the chair. In the meantime steps will
|be taken for the securing of club
rooms and a start will be made on the
work of fitting them up shortly.
The following board of directors
was appointed* last night: Mrs. A. T.
McGary, Dr. Mary Halton, Mies Claire
Donovan, Miss Eleanor Roberts, Mrs.
Anna M. Kirk, Miss Alice Eagan, Miss
Lillllan Johnson, Miss Bertie Clifford,
j Miss Ray Schwartz, Miss Mary Perls

rived yesterday afternoon, ending a
cruise which began at this port August

â  ii l ands the Carrie and Annie, was ac
companied by his wife, who has had
â¢more than her fill, she says, of cruis
ing: ip Carrie and Annie sized schoon
.ers.- The elements celebrated the new
year by combining in an effort to send
the little schooner to the bottom. She
.shipped many seas and her crew had
to work hard to weather the gale, but
the'litfle craft came through intact.
. During the Carrie and Annie's stay
at Ponapi the German gunboat Condor
arrived there on its way to New
Guinea to avenge the assassination by
cannibal natives of five Catholic priests
and five sisters, who had been working
among Germany's South Sea posses
sions as missionaries. One of the priests
.massacred is said to have been the
oldest missionary in the South Seas.
The Condor was going to call at Yap
. fo-r coal and then proceed to New
. Guinea .and there shoot up a few vil
lages to inspire the savage inhabitants
' w-ith" respect for the Kaiser and rever
. *?nce for the dead missionaries' reli
gion.-'
. . The Carrie and Annie carried from
'.here stores for the missionary stations
:in' the. Carolines. She came home in

for the.round trip.

OLD SHIP PYRENEES IS
GIVEN AMERICAN REGISTRY
With Her Cargo Burning She Drifts
on Coral Reef, Is Resuscitated and
Rechristened Manga Reva.
American registry was granted yes
terday to the four-masted bark Manga
Reva by Customs Collector Stratton.
The bark is the property of Captain P.
E. Thayer and has a very romantic
h;story. She was formerly the British
ship Pryeriees, built ln Glasgow ln
1891, of steel, and while engaged ln
carrying wheat from Tacoma to Liver- i
pool took fire. The Are became so hot I
that the crew took to the boats and !
abandoned the vessel, which drifted |
upon Manga Reva, a coral island of
the Gambler group in the South Seas,
on December 2, 1900. Captain Thayer
visited the wreck and offered the Brit
ish owners 11250 for her, which was
accepted. Tlee captain succeeded ln
getting her off the reef, brought her
to this port and here sold 1400 tons of
damaged wheat, the proceeds repay
ing the purchase money and the cost
of bringing the craft here.
A large sum of money was spent for
repairs and the ship's name was
changed to Manga Reva, She Is a ves
sel of 2053 tons and is valued at
$150,000.
Grants Spur Track Permits.
The Supervisor*' Street Committee j
yesterday granted permits for spur!
tracks to the Tubbs Cordage Com- I
pany. The tracks will be on Indiana
street, between Twenty-first and
Twenty-second, and to the Illinois Pa- >
clflc Glass Company on Harrison and
Fifteenth streets. The petition of C.
N. Felton for a spur track permit on
Japan street, between Brannan and :
Townsend, was withdrawn, and a pro
test against the same was filed. Ac
tion on the ordering of street work on
Parnassus avenue, between Stanyan
and Wlllard streets, was postponed
one week. A motion that the work be
not recommended until Lotta street Is
improved was not voted on. I
WOULD CANCEL
THE CONTRACT
Board of Works Consider Re
fusal of Yorke Company to
Eepair Bituminous Streets
PERMIT FOR SPUR TRACK
Give United Railroads Priv
ilege to Build Curve at the
Corner of Post and Kearny
The Board of Public Works yester
day resumed consideration of the F. M.
Yorke Company's refusal to repair bi
tuminous pavements. A resolution was
adopted declaring; the contract "for
feited. It is possible that the board will
Itself repair the streets, hiring "day
labor."
F. M. Yorke filed a long communica
tion in which the course of the Finance
Committee in refusing to pay demands
for work done comes ln for a large
share of adverse criticism. The com
pany's president alleges that the un
favorable attitude of the committee
was based on the uncorroborated testi
j mony of one Henry Brantjen, a dis
; charged employe, who had testified
: that the capacity of the plant was ln
-1 adequate to do the work charged for
I repairs in August, which is denied by
| a statement of figures showing that
I the plant was capable of doing more
i than the work charged for. Reference
jis also made to the specifications
' adopted by Phelan's Board of Works,
' which were disregarded on the express
I order of Inspector Boone, relative to
I the filling in of holes exceeding 2*6
' inches ln depth. The letter says, in
part:
When I was assured br the official Inspector
that a strict compliance, ln all cases, with
the specifications would seriously affect the
' durability of repairs, F. M. Yorke & Co. con
sented to the deviation suggested by Inspector
i Boone. For this the company has been un
j Justly and maliciously abused and maligned
by the Finance Committee. Under the eir-
I cumstances, I deem it advisable to notify
your board that if F. M. Yorke & Co. again
I resume the work of repairing the streets they
will insist, in all cases, ut>on a strict and
I absolute adherence to the contract and specl
i flcatlons. If this results '- a poor quality of
i work let the public place the blame upon the
; Finance Committeee. where it belongs.
There is now due F. M. Yorxe & Co. over
$14,000 for work upon the public streets. It is
quite apparent that, regardless of the Justness
I of the demands, the Finance Committee intends
pers.stently to reject all bills presented by the
company. F. M. Yorke & Co. refuse further
|to be made the victims of political and re
. ligious bigotry. They will not resume work
; until they are convinced that they will receive
I honest and fair treatment at the hands of the
' Finance Committee.
The resolution rescinding the con
tract was carried by the votes of Com
missioners Aigeltinger and Maestretti,
on motion of the first named. Commis
sioner Maestretti voted in the negative,
harshly scoring the Supervisors for
their attitude, and saying that he did
not think the board had the legal right
ito abrogate the contract, as he consid
! ered that the Yorke company had acted
!in good faith. The resolution was then
; repealed, as it was not desired to take
; summary action. The board ordered a
j copy of the communication from the
j company to be sent to the Board of
i Supervisors, which was also asked to
I give the Works Board authority to pro
ceed with the repairs of the streets on
its own account. This course will bring
the matter to an issue.
TO PAVE MISSION STREET.
I The board adopted a resolution ask
ing authority from the Supervisors for
the bituminizing and improvement of
Mission street, from Onondaga to Mo
hawk avenues, for which $80,000 has
been set aside in the budget.
The board ordered Holbrook, Merrill
& Stetson to remove its spur track on
Townsend street, between Fifth and
Sixth, or the board would tear it up
on its own account. Although the Su
pervisors grant- " a permit for the spur
the Board of T orks never granted a
permit to tear up the street.
Several property owners appealed to
the board to take steps to pave H
street, the contract for which was
awarded to F. M. Yorke, but was can
celed because the formal authority of
| the Board of Supervisors had not been
first secured. It was said that the
i Yorke company had declared that it
: would begin injunction proceedings if
the contract was awarded to any one
j else, as it had done $3000 worth of work
\ before the contract was abrogated,
j "We have been considering this mat-
I ter with a view of affording some re
â  lief," said Commissioner Maestretti,
i "but the action of the Supervisors has
j put a stop to the work. Bids were mi
i vlted a second time a. d the prices were
jln excess of those made by the Yorke
; company. As some of the work was
i already done there seems to be a legal
defect in the proposals that all the
work was to be performed."
"The property owners and residents
are not blaming this board for the de
lay," said Frank Cornyn. "The Super
visors are held to be responsible for the
cessation of work. The money for the
Improvement has been appropriated
and should be used. We are com
j pelled to walk in a foot of mud on H
street."
GRANTS PERMIT FOR CURVE.
The United Railroads filed a petition
for permission to construct a double
spur track curve at Post and Kearny
streets. This is the point where the
old spur was torn up some months ago I
because no permit had been granted l
therefor. The board adopted a resolu- |
tlon granting the permit, after Man-1
ager Chapman had informed it that the
new spur would be fourteen inches far
ther away from the sidewalk curb than
formerly.
The curve will be seven feet away
from the sidewalk. Maestretti said
that numerous requests had been re
ceived from merchants on Kearny and
other streets that the curve would af- j
ford better traffic facilities ln the down
town district.

ADULTERATION
UNDER THE BAN
Health Board Proposes Legis
lation Insuring Pure Food,
Cream, Drugs and Milk
RAGAN SUGGESTS LAWS
Restricts Sale of Carbolic
Acid and Serving of Poi
sonous Illuminating Gas
Health Officer Ragan yesterday pre
pared drafts of resolutions to be pre
sented at the meeting of the Health
Board to-day recommending the enact
â  Wit of legislation prohibiting the sale
of adulterated food, drugs, milk and
cream; prohibiting the sale of carbolic
acid without a physician's prescription
and also making It unlawful for gas
manufacturers to permit poisonous gas
to escape from their mains.
The ordinance on the latter subject is 1
prompted by the fact that there were
seventy-five accidental and sixty-three
suicidal deaths from inhalation of gas
last year. The proposed ordinance pro- j
vides as follows:
No person or firm or corporation, being a '
manufacturer of gas, *or engaged about ths
manufacture thereof, shall permit to escape ;
from any of their works, mains or pipes any
gas dangerous or prejudicial to life or health
or manufacture illuminating gas of such ln- '
gredieuts and quality that in the process of |
burning it any substance which shall escape j
therefrom shall be prejudicial or dangerous to
life and health or fail to use the most ap
prowd or all reasonable means for preventing
the escape of such gas.
UNADULTERATED CREAM.
No cream which is adulterated shall bs
brought into the city and county of San Fran
cisco or held, kept, sold or offered for sale
ln said city and county; nor shall any one
keep for sale or offer for sale In said city any
such cream.
The term cream means the fatty portions of
pure milk which rise to the surface when ths
milk Is left at rest or which are separated by
mechanical means.
The terra adulterate when vied in this seo
tion refers to cream to which any foreign
substance whatever has been added.
Ragan reoommends that the bacteri
ological standard of milk purity be
fixed at 500,000 per cubic centimeter, as
it is in Boston. Out of 500 samples
submitted, the presence of 733,693 bac
teria has been demonstrated, which is
far ln excess of the health require
ments.
Another ordinance provides regula
tions for the sale of drugs and poisons
and prohibits the sale of pure or 95
per cent solution of carbolic acid with
out a physician's prescription. In the
matter of adulterated foods the follow-
ing regulations are recommended, in
cluding a special clause on spirituous
and malt liquors:
The Department of Health of the city and
county of San Francisco shall consider the evi
dence and findings submitted by the United
States Chemist, W. H. Wiley, of the Depart
ment of Agriculture as conclusive in the case
of borax and boracic acid and shall consider
these two chemicals as Ingredients which are
recko.iea as injurious to health.
Spirituous, fermented and malt liquors shall
be deemed adulterated if they shall contain
any rubstance or ingredient not normal or
healthful to exist in spirituous or fermented
or malt liquors or which may be deleterious or
detrimental to health when such liquors are
upt?d as a beveraee.
Confectionery shall be deemed adulterated If
it contains terra alba, barytes, talc, or other
mineral substance or poisonous colors or flavors
or other ingredients deleterious or detrimental
to health.

Health Office Wants New Quarters.
Health Officer Ragan appeared be

office of the Health Board be changed
to the quarters now occupied by the
license office and the room directly
above occupied by the Hastings Law
College be assigned to the Department
of Health and connected with the of
fice by a spiral staircase. Ragan said
the health offices would be made more
compact. The committee decided that
it could not make the changes desired
owing to lack of funds and because
the Hastings Law College uses the room
under an act of the Legislature. The
committee, however, allowed $160 to
make alterations in the chemical lab
oratory.

CHINESE NEUTRALITY.
THE third Russian note respecting Chinese violations of neu- j
trality is on its way to the powers. When it is at hand it may
be compared with the Japanese note and accompanying proofs, j
charging Russian violations of Chinese neutrality. Among these ;â¢
. . were the use of Chinese territory for a wireless telegraph station ;
for war purposes, violation of the time limit by Russian warships in j
Chinese ports, and a long list of acts in disrespect of the rights of j
China.
The presence on the Chinese frontier of Manchuria of General ,
Ma and his forces was protested by r Ãussia at Peking several months ;
ago, and Russia made a set attack on the Peking Government, j
. threatening to consider the protection of her frontier by China a vio
. lation of neutrality! It is believed that at that time China took
counsel of the representatives of other nations and continued her j
frontier guard. In many other ways Russia has seemed to pursue
a policy at Peking designed to nag China into some overt act.
Now she goes to the nations with a complaint, and as far as >
its text is known it is adroitly framed to appeal to those powers ;
.that have, by hook and by crook, acquired a foothold in China. They j
are warned that Japanese influence, spurring the national ambition
of China, endangers these foreign acquisitions. Diplomacy will treat j
all this with politeness, which is a leading element* in international
intercourse. But the Russian note, read between the lines, means |
that as Russia has lost Port Arthur and Dalny and is about to lose
Mukden, she would like some help to get them back by making
the other powers afraid that they will share her fate.
So the note is either an invitation, or the preliminary to an invi
tation, to the other nations to help Russia out of her bad fix. It is an
attempt to occupy the time between the defeats that are meeting
her arms, in transferring the issue back to diplomacy by which she
got her foothold in China. One point in the note that is given spe
cial prominence is that Japan secures contraband of war from China.
So did Russia. Port Arthur was victualed and her armament and
munitions reinforced by contraband from China. The United States
is neutral, but every ship that leaves our Pacific ports carries con
traband either to Japan or Russia. Contracts are now existing in
this country for the shipment of contraband to Vladivostok and to
Yokohama. Does Russia desire to threaten the United States there
for? In all wars there is trade in contraband. The Cuban revolu
tion was armed and fed by contraband from our South Atlantic and
Gulf ports. This contraband trade is at owners' risk. The Govern
ment proclaims against it, and if caught the owners cannot appeal to
their own Government, but must stand the loss.
The situation as far as it affects China was foreseen by Secre
tary Hay. and was safeguarded by his note to the powers. At pres
ent the Chinese general, Ma, and his army, stand on the Chinese side
of the Manchurian border. But Manchuria was a part of the Chinese
empire and was under Chinese administration, until Russia seized it
by force, taking it by actual conquest though there was no war be
tween her and China. The violence and suddenness of this seizure
are of record in the State Department at Washington. W : e had just
made a treaty with China, opening to our commerce two Manchu
rian towns, Kinchow and Mukden. Our Government immediately
appointed Consuls to those towns, but when the Consuls arrived
. they found the towns in possession of Russia and were forbidden
entrance.
Japan has possession of Kinchow and will soon have Mukden.
If she turn them over again to Chinese jurisdiction, they will simply
have been wrested from Russia and put back where they were when
our trer'y was made and our Consuls were appointed. If in like
manner Japan hand over to China all of Manchuria except Port Ar
thur, and General Ma move his army into that territory, will Russia's
complaint be heeded by the powers? That remains to be seen. One
thing is certain, the United States will stand for the integrity of
Chinese jurisdiction within her administrative entity, and will not
regard Chinese jurisdiction over Chinese territory as a violation of
neutrality. Russian diplomacy is not in very high favor just now,
except at a very few of the Continental capitals, and the Czar will
probably end his troubles quicker by going on getting whipped than
by taking an appeal to the diplomatic forum.
Heretofore it has been easy and safe to threaten, browbeat and
rob China, and Russia has indulged in all these. Now Secretary Hay
steps in and by sending a note to China enables her to answer
Russia by answering the United States. The result will be the
complete disproof of every Russian allegation against China, and a
notice to the powers that the neutrality of that empire must be re
spected.
THE good name of the Missouri Legislature was lost in baking
powder. Before some dietetic reformer sought to protect the
purity of the hot biscuits which are a daily article of diet in
that State, the Missouri Legislature was an innocent, care free and
upright body. Then came baking powder legislation with lobby
ists for or against it, and the legislators fell away down. The lob
byists bought them singly and in bunches. They bribed the Lieu
tenant Governor, and when they got through, baking powder had
undone the whole Legislature. In the subsequent proceedings the
Lieutenant Governor ran to sanctuary in the holy city of Chicago,
and others sought safety and repose in Texas. But they were all
brought back and some of them were sent to the penitentiary. Gov
ernor Folk was instrumental in exposing these baking powder
statesmen, and he reveals, now that he is Governor, decided opinions
about lobbyists. He proposes to protect the rural members from
the wiles and temptations and lures of the lobby.
In his inaugural he says that the Governor will require all lob
byists who arrive at the capital to report to him, and make a state
ment of their business. Thereafter they may stay thirty hours and
then must depart. It is said that the Governor's experience in
ging up the baking powder affair proved to him that it takes sixty
hours to overcome the objection of a member to being bribed, and
so he puts a time limit so far below that that he is certain of being
able to pull the Legislature through without scandals.
In his plan there is a suggestion useful to other States, and to
the Tfational Government as well. If a lobbyist is compelled to reg
ister and declare himself, there will not be so many of them.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. JANUARY 19, 1905.
CHADWICK'S SHRINE
T. BLAIR EATON
"Let me say my rosary to the
real saint," he pleaded.
+
WHEN the two touring cars
stopped ln the shade of some
cork trees and the hampers
were being ransacked for
lunch, Chadwick managed to
convince Miss Norton that the view
from the top of the rocky little hill by
the roadside was well worth the climb.
Together they ascended the winding
footpath that wound Its way up the
hill, and stood on the summit looking
across the brown fields of Tuscany to
the faint blue line of water in the dis
tance.
Close at hand was a clump of stunt
ed olive trees, and beneath the trees
was the shrine of some saint. They had
been on the summit of the hill but a
few minutes when a peasant woman
came toiling up the path, and with
scarcely a glance at the two Ameri
cans knelt before the shrine and began
to mutter rapid prayers while she deft
ly fingered a rosary.
They watched her ln silence; Miss
Norton with a smile of understanding
and quick sympathy, and Chadwick
with that look of sardonic complacency
that men of his type affect In the pres
ence of religious devotions.
Her beads told, the woman shambled
down the Dath again, the bright ker
chief about her head making a moving
bit of color against the brown of the
landscape.
"Her prayers seem to be a sort of
machine-made product," Chadwick ob
served.
The girl shook a finger at him.
"Don't scoff." she said.
Chadwick shrugged his broad shoul
ders.
"I'd hate to be an interpreter of Ital
ian ln celestial realms," said he. "Did
you hear how she reeled them off? I
couldn't make out a word of It."
"I didn't try to understand," said
she. "I was thinking of the pictur
esqueness of It."
"It did have Its color," he admitted,
and pointing to the shrine continued:
"I wonder what saint that is? The
tip of his nose is gone and he seems
rather weather-beaten."
The girl laughed in spite of her ef
forts to maintain a grave expression.
WOMAN IS EXPERT
FARMER AT 76 YEARS
Mary Jane TJlrich, farmer, aged
76. is as spry and active as a girl of
16. When a caller at her home, near
Kokomo, Ind., asked her to pose for a
picture among her farming imple
ments she climbed over a reaper to
reach a corner among the collection.
The TJlrich farm, ten miles south
east of Kokomo, comprises seventy
acres and gives evidence of good hus
bandry.
Mrs. Ulrich's specialty Is hogs. She
has never bought but one herd in the
eighteen years she has pursued her
occupation. She raises a drove tor
the market each year and has never
been troubled with cholera. As a side
Issue Mrs. TJlrich has sold an average
of six hundred pounds of butter a
year and about four hundred chickens
annually.
Mrs. TJlrich came to Tipton County
from Ripley County In December,
1864. She has been a widow eighteen
years. Speaking of her entrance into
agricultural pursuits she says:
"My husband and I lived on a farm.
He devoted most of his time, however,
to plastering and bricklaying. I often
took charge of the farm work and di
rected the hands about the thrashing
machines and clover hullers. I
shucked corn and raked wheat ln the
fields when the old wooden rakes were
ln use. I have always been ln love
with farm life and delighted in watch.,
lng the growth of plant and animal
life. After my husband's death I
took complete charge of affairs."
Mrs. Ulrica. Is entitled to member
ship ln the Daughters of the American
Revolution, her grandfather having
participated in that conflict.
COFFIN AS PANTRY.
Nicholas Sutton, aged Bl years, died
ln Rome, N. T., recently. He lived all
alone, his wife having died eighteen
years ago. In a corner of one of the
rooms stood a coffin which Sutton
made fifteen years ago. In this coffin
he had three shelves, on which he kept
his food, using It for a pantry- The
shelves were taken out of the coffin
and an undertaker prepared it for the
remains of the deceased.
To Modify Pure Food Laws.
The German manufacturers and
shopkeepers are finding the rigid en
forcement of the present pure food laws
very Irksome, even though there is no
attempt at adulteration. Apparently
Germany will have to do as this coun
try has done, first establish exact defi
nitions of products, constituents and
foreign ingredients ror all articles of
food. 4
! "Aren't you ever serious?*' she said
chidingly. "Don't such things ever Im
press you as rather solemn?"
"I confess to an undue sense of the
incongruous," said he. "Still, I think
It applies largely to externals. The
spirit of the thingâlts underlying
meaningâdoes impress me tremen
dously. I'm very much in sympathy
with these shrines. Indeed, I maintain
one myself."
The girl eyed him narrowly. She was
vainly trying to fathom the import of
his words.
"Where is this' shrine of yours?" she
asked. ,
"Wherever I am," said he.
"Do you ever worship before It?" she
inquired.
"Many times dally," he declared.
"I didn't realize you were ln sym
pathy with anything of the kind," she
observed.
"Didn't you?" he asked cheerfully.
"Well, I've many excellent qualities
as yet undiscovered."
"I'd like to hear about this shrine,"
said she. "A pagan so devout must
certainly appeal to that abnormal
sense of the incongruous you claim
for yourself."
"When I seek my shrine I'm not a
pagan," he declared. "It's not a
shrine like this. It's a mental shrine,
and in it I have placed my patron
saint." j
"What sort of a saint?" she do*
manded with a hint of incredulity in
her voice.
Chadwick looked at her with a de
liberate gaze. He was smiling as he
went on:
"A very gentle saint that any man
might be proud to worship; a saint
with brown hair and dark eyes and
all the beauty and goodness of the
universe stamped on her face; a saint
that is enshrined in the heart of every
honest, right-minded man; in simpler
words, the ideal woman."
The girl looked at him and colored
slightly.
"And that's year vaunted shrine T"
she asked.
He nodded.
â¦"It's not as picturesque as this one
here," said she.
"It is to me," he declared. "Any
way, the mere worshiping at the
shrine has made a different man of
me."
She looked across the brown fields.
"Do you say Italian prayers to your
saint?" she asked.
"I'd say good English ones if I
dared," he replied. "Thank goodness,
my saint has not been transplanted to
spiritual abodes as yet. But I only
dare utter ineffectual petitions to her
Image in the shrine."
"Why?" she demanded.
'Tm afraid a direct intercession to
her might result in her discouraging
my worship," said he.
"Perhaps not," she said softly, look
ing toward the blue thread of water.
He took a step toward her, but she
darted past him and began to de
scend the path.
"Come," she called to Mm, "they'll
have lunch ready under the cork
trees."
He ran. down the path and caught
her arm.
"Let me say my rosary to the real
saint," he pleaded. "The image ln
the shrine Is, after all, rather unsatis
factory."
"Perhaps the real saint will be,"
she suggested blushingly.
'Til risk It," he laughed, and arm
in arm they ran down the path to the
cork trees.

HIS CHOICE.
An Irishman traveling in Prance was
challenged by a Frenchman to fight a
duel, to which he readily consented,
and suggested shlllelahs as weapons.
"That won't do," said the French
man's second. "As challenged party
you have the right to choose the arms,
but chivalry demands that you should
decide upon a weapon with which
Frenchmen are â¢familiar."
"Is that so?" replied the Irishman,
coolly. "Very well, we'll fight with
guillotines."
French in England.
The London Graphic says that the
multitude of writers eagerly seeking for

LIVES ONLY ON AIR
FOR MORE THAN WEEK
IN SEALED-UP BOTTLE
Papuss in Sealed Bottle.
â¢
THE Crystal Palace Theater of
Varieties at Leipzig Is attract
ing much attention on account
of Papuss, Its latest novelty.
Papuss is a South American by
birth, who, by sheer strength of will,
or "auto-suggestion" can live on air
for eight days and nights in a glass
case. What Is known of his experi
ment creates astonishment. At first
he lay for a week ln a glass case like
the snow maiden ln the fairy tale,
then he existed on compressed air un
der water in a peculiarly constructed
submarine boat, until at last he came
to his present form of eight-day In
carceration in the original six-sided
bottle-shaped glass house into which
he stepped ln Leipzig. This recep
tacle allows only the smallest move
ment on the part of the hunger artist
inside the glass cage. Papuss has no
comforts to mitigate the peculiar
character of his experiment. He pre
sents a mummified appearance stand
ing all day ln the narrow glass space
In which he can make only the slight
est turning movement. At night a
horizontal position Is allowed. The
demonstration of this new hunger
man differs considerably from that of
the Italians, Merlatti and Succi, and
Dr. Henry Tanner, the American, who
retained their liberty. ~ , Â«i
Papuss, who seeks to break the
monotony of his imprisonment ln
some measure with cigarette smok
ing, is under strong control. Not only
Is his glass case tied up with cords
and sealed, but It is watched day and
night to render deception impossible.
NEW FISH STORY.
Burgess H. C. Frank tells of his
catching a salmon in the Juniata
River, east of Newport, Pa., that
weighed seven pounds. The fish itself
was a fine specimen, but the most in

fish was being cleaned Frank declares
he found a padlock and key ln its
stomach. The lock, so says the bur
gess, is 3% by IVt Inches in size, and
the key, which is two inches long, was
intact in the lock.

GRAPE-NUTS.
MUSIC LESSONS
Often Bring on Nervous Troubles if
i In- Food Is Not Right.
; It is curious how the study of music
and piano practice brings on so many
eases of nervous prostration. One would
think that an art so divine would pro-
X-ect'its votaries. Sometimes the food is
.at fault.
. The daughter of a Minister in Al
â¢oai\y. Wis., when in the midst of her
Studies in music, found herself run
down and approaching nervous pros
tration.
â¢ â¢ "She lost flesh rapidly, appetite dis
appeared, and that distressing sign of
approaching sickness âlassitude and
wearinessâwas with her steadily."
The Ministerâher Fatherâhad her
put on Grape-Nuts, and she began an
improvement immediately. He says:
"Scores of mornings she ate nothing but
Grape-Nuts and cream for breakfast,
ajid improved so rapidly that it was a
.surprise to the family. Now she is in
fine condition, has continued her stud
ies, walks four times a day to schoolâ
three-quarters of a mile each wayâ
and is a fine specimen of health and
strength."
' The Minister speaks of another young
â¢girl i years old, who suffered terribly
from chronic indigestion, and was un
abj'e to attend school, a weak, puny lit
fle girl who could not eat any sort of
food without distress.
' Upon the suggestion of the Minister
â¢slie was put on Grape-Nuts food and
a change began to take place within a
day or two. She is now a healthy, nat
ural girl.
. There's a reason. Every little parti
cle of Grape-Nuts, when examined by
a magnifying glass, shows on the out
side small particles of sugar. This is
riot : ordinary sugar, but Is a peculiar
kind - resulting from the change of
starch Into sugar, which exudes from
the particles during the process of
manufacture. This is called Post
Sugar and is ready for digestion and
assimilation without in any way tax
ing the organs of the body.
â¢ That t* one reason why Grape-Nuts
will rebuild a person quickly. There is
another and even more important rea
son. 'The food contains certain ele
ments selected from wheat and barley

GIRL WITNESS
REPEATS STORY
Says Mother Did Not Write
Will and That Grandmoth
er Removed the Property
REPLIES TO QUESTIONS
â¢
Has Reasons for Believing
That Her Parents Would
Approve of Her Decision
When little Roberta Genevieve Smith
told Judge Kerrigan that she would
rather have her stepmother for a
guardian than her grandmother she
was not expressing a childish whim.
She knew things, and yesterday she
! told them ln court, and there were dra-
I matic consequences -
Not the least Interesting of the many
; revelations made by the 13-year-old
heiress was one in which she related
that her father had told her that he
did not believe that her mother had
made the will, attributed to her. but
that it had been written by the grand
m " er Â£ t Â° The will was shown to the
child and she unhesitatingly declared
that she did not think it was written
in her mother's hand, because the writ
ing "slanted the other way."
Roberta had been called to the stand
by Attorney John A. Wright, repre
senting Mrs. Ella Chamberlain, the
grandmother, who is one of three ap
plicants for letters of guardianship over
the two small children of the late But
ler Smith. The girl and her 2-year-old
brother will share in the combined es
tates of their father and mother, val
ued at about $150,000. On Tuesday the
child had expressed a preference for
her stepmother, Emily May Smith, who
married the father six weeks before
i his death.
i Attorney Wright asked Roberta if
she thought her mother ln heaven
, would approve of her choice asainst
the grandmother. The little maid re
plied that she was sure of it because
her mother had not loved Mrs. Cham
berlain, and had said before she died
that she wished the children would not
be under her influence.
There was a like certainty as to her
idea of her father's wishes. She said
that he had told her that Mrs. Cham
berlain, before leaving their house, had
taken things that did not belong; to her
Mrs. Chamberlain on the stand denied
that she had removed anything that
did not belong to her.
The tiny witness also told of the find
ing of empty whisky flasks under the
mattresses in the room which had been
occupied by her grandmother at the
Smith house.
Another witness, strongly in favor of
the widow's claims, was Rev. J. S.
Thomas of the Howard Presbyterian
Church. He said that Smith had told
him that he needed a wife who could
come into the family and take care
of his children, and he considered his
second marriage as providential.
During the hearing one of Mrs.
Chamberlain's friends, a Mrs. Sudan,
lost control of her discretion and turn
ing to Mrs. Emily May Smith accused
her of having hypnotized the little Kirl.
The hearing will be resumed to-day.
GRAND JURORS INSPECT
SEVERAL SHOWHOUSES
Accompanied by Public Works Com
missioners They Look for Viola
tion- of Fire Ordinance.
Foreman Andrews and E. J. Bowes
of the Grand Jury and the members
of the Board of Public Works yester
day resumed their inspection of show
houses to learn whether the fire ordi
nance was being complied with. The
theaters visited were the California,
the Alcazar, Fischer's and the Bel
vedere. The Oberon and La Boheme
concert halls were also called upon.
Architect Newton J. Tharp conducted
the inspection, dictating his observa
tions to a stenographer. After his re
port has been prepared the Grand
Jury committee and the Board of Pub
lic Works will hold a conference as to
what steps shall be taken to enforce
r. more strict observance of the law.
At almost every show place viola
tions of the ordinance were found, some
of minor importance, others of a grave
character. There is some question as
to whether the ordinance shall be
made to apply to the concert halls,
none of which has made any attempt
to comply with its provisions-
Public Works Commissioner Maes
tretti took exception to the manner in
which the jurors were conducting the
investigation and after the California
had been visited he abruptly left the
party. He and Juror Bowes had a
few sharp words over the matter.
Two more vaudeville houses applied
to the Superior Court yesterday for in
junctions to prevent the Board of
Public Works and Chief of Police
Wittman from closing their doors. At
torney H. C. McPike filed the com
plaint for the Novelty Theater, which
succeeded the old Hill's Theater and
Palm Concert Hall at 104 Powell
street. It is declared that necessary
repairs to conform to the fire ordi
nance have been made. The Mission
Amusement Company, which opened
about six weeks ago at Mission and
Twenty-second streets, had a longer
tale of woe. It declared that it has a
model theater, with more exits than
larger houses, and that the construc
tion was approved with the exception
of certain minor details, which have
since been remedied. The place has,
it Is said, been commended by the Fire
Department, but the Board of Works
refuses to issue a permit and the Chief
of Police has threatened to close the
house.
FRANK JORDAN RETURNS
FROM FIRST TRIP EAST
Supreme Court Clerk Has Enjoyable
Time Beyond Sierras, but Is
Glad He Is Back.
Frank C. Jordan, clerk of the Bu
' preme Court, agent for voting ma
chines and the most prominent heated
atmosphere and "glad hand" artist in
all the Golden West, returned yester- ;
day with the rainstorm from his first
trip East. "California for your Uncle
Willie," was his greeting along the
line. He went to the Atlantic coast
as the guest of the people for whom
he sells voting machines. He returns
with his pockets full of holdover Ha
vanas, the memory of many a lurid
celebration of the Indivisible bond ex
isting between the North and the
South and the â¢Bast and the West, to
gether with an agency for a barroom
contrivance which "takes your picture
for a nickel In a minute and a half
while you stand on it."
In Denver he saw Market street and
the mineral exhibit ln the Capitol. In
Chicago he saw Clark street and
nursed his head during the rest of his
stay. In New Tork he saw the Bow
ery, the subway and the Grant mon
ument. In Boston he stopped at the
Hotel Italy and made a valorous
moonlight charge up Bunker Hill. In
other cities he saw other things, about
which he will tell the elect when he
gets opportunity.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY,. JANUARY 19, 1905.
TRIBUNE STAFF
AS SATIRISTS
IS6UE SPRIGHTLY PUBLICATION
Chicago Newspaper Men Give Good
Advice to Novices.
The inner workings of a newspaper
j office, and the troubles of the men who
! sacrifice their nerves and their diges
! tion to feed a hungry public with the
! news of the world are extensively treat-'
ed in the Little Tribune, a magazine
written by the staff of the Chicago
Tribune.
j Roseate Ideas that the young aspir
! ant holds in regard to the profession
i are dispelled by the men who know.
Newspaper men are always ready to
execrate their work.
Gaze upon this picture of a newspa
per man's life:
After hastily gathering the "particular*"
' for a three-column article on the life of the
distinguished citizen, the new reporter waa
once more cosily ensconced ln his private of
fice. Before he could compose himself to dic
tate to his beautiful stenographer a rap was
heard upon the door and the office boy ap
: peared in uniform bearing a card.
> "Senator S. has been waiting an hour to
I see you sir."
â  "O tell him to come ln. I'll hold the story
for the city edition, Carrie," and the beau
tiful stenographer, casting one lingering look
behind, deuarted. f
, "Oh, it's you. Senator. I haven't seen you
since we. put that ticket through the Spring
i field convention."
The Senator Invited him to Join a party of
Congressmen and Judges who were going to
sit down at a banquet at the Auditorium.
"Just wait till I put on my dress suit,"
said the reporter, "and I'll be with you ln
a Jiffy. Make yourself at home. Here's all the
latest magazines and the cigars."
The new reporter appeared a moment later.
Immaculate ln black and white, for he kept
his evening clothes for such assignments as
might take him Into the domiciles of the money
kings and society lords.
"Jimmy," he said, "telephone over to the
Garrlck and ask them to reserve a box for
me to-morrow night, and wait," he eald, slip
ping a quarter into the boy's delighted hand,
"Just tell them It's for me, you know."
The office boy's answer startled the new re
porter.
"Hey, dere, youse. Wake up! Beck wants
; you. lire's a guy croaked out on Sixty-fifth
and Halsted."
It was 11 o'clock at night. T* new re
porter started up and rubbed his eyes. "Say.
can you lend me a quarter, old man?" he
asked.
There is nothing fanciful ln that
awakening. Before Lawson created the
expression "frenzied finance" the news
paper man knew what it meant. The
staff of the first periodical experienced
the feeling of "awful brokeness." In
Goldsmith's time, and before, the news
paper man was a frenzied financier.
The advice contained in the letter
from a made-over reporter to his
younger brother is not altogether sat
irical. Any Journalist who has grad
uated from a cub to an all-around man
can tell where the jest is and where
the truth is. It runs thus:
Dear Jack: Come to Chi.'oco if yjii want
to. You say you are always fretting down
home because no one can teach you anything
mere about newspaper work. Tou'll find a lot
here who can
Better try the City Press first. It's a train
ing school for reporters. If you can stick It
out there a year or two without quitting to
a bread wagon you'll worry along. All
edllor* here pass embryo Journalists along to
the City Press, where they get $S a week and
\aluable advice.
You'll learn where the expensive cafes ere
and keep away from them. You'll find places
wborj you can get a fair meal for a nickel.
Then when you get famous you can write Â»,p
your experiences for the Workers' Magazine
for Cbristmat. money.
Unless you are determined to throttle the
world ln a pleasant, gentlemanly way, you
have nr business coming here. It's all "tght
tj have Ideals and a good bunch of Imagl'ia
tlon. You can wrap them up carefully end
put them away until you get ready to us-e
them. It's Just a game, that's ail, and the
only way to ple.y it is to keep up a stiff blv-tt
and laugh, no matter what happens. They
say laughing makes you grow fat. All my
clothes are getting tight. Only don't bluff too
much, unless you have the goods, or you will
get called.
It's Just as bad to have a poor opinion of
yourself. You say you've written so much
you've written out. There's nothing ln that.
There's a little old man here, who looks like
a country editor, whose paragraphs are copied
all over the United States. They are frjsh,
fragrant and buoyant, and he's beÂ«n doing
them for thirty-five years.
You'll learn a lot about style after you have
had a few rounds with the copy desk. Ths
copy readers will take your story, cut all the
paragraphs apnrt with a pair of scissors and
shuffle them up for a new deal. This is dons
to correct hopscotching and improve the story,
end Eometlmes It does.
A good cony reader with a bad liver can
save his office several hundred dollars a year
in retxirters' salaries. Just as a reporter, is
beginning to think he is making good and has
made up his mind to tease the C. E. for a
raise of salary the good copy reader, anxious
to earn his salary, will get hold of that re
porter's stuff and switch It around so much
that th e reporter will wonder whether hÂ«
worked that day.
Some reporters try to "fix" the desk but
they nearly always loan money to the wrong
copy readers.
There'll be days when, to relieve your pent
up feelings, you will feel like kicking a -nice.
new, shiny, black coal bucket around the city
room till it hasn't any more varnish on It.
I've known reporters to call up sixteen Al
dermen on a Sunday afternoon for two cheap
interviews. About the only consolation you
will have on a Sunday Is ths comic supple
ment.
Save your money, get together all the nerve
you can and come on.
We are not told whether the aspirant
decided to "throttle the word in a
pleasant, gentlemanly sort of way" or
not. But any man who has to match
his intelligence with the learned and
outwit the shrewdest in the daily rou^

PEYTON COMPANY CHARGES
TRUST WITH BAD FAITH
An answer was made .yesterday by
the Peyton Chemical Company to the
application of the L E. DuPont de
Nemours Powder Company, otherwise
the powder trust, for a writ of man
date compelling the chemical com
pany to permit an inspection of Its
books by an agent of the trust. The
answer pleads first that the plaintiff is
a New Jersey corporation doing busi
ness in California without having
complied with the laws requiring the
filing of. its articles of incorporation
in this State and county and there
fore is not entitled to maintain an ac
tion in the courts.
Then it is declared that- the powder
monopoly seeks an inspection of the
books for the purpose of acquiring In
formation to be used for the injury
of the corporation and Its business;
that it desires to acquire the secrets
of the business for the purpose of ex
posing them to business rivals and
that the secrets, if gained, will be used
in harassing the chemical company
into meeting the demand that its con
tiol be given over to the DuPont
company.

tine of newspaper work knows that
there is more wisdom than satire In the
letter.
There is much in the Little Tribune
that only the initiatecf can understand,
as, for example, the following:
The printer set his speckled hen
Upon a dozen eggs;
She sight he witnessed than
Quite took htm oft his legs.
"A dozen eggs I nut her on,"
He cried, "and I've gained six.
For now the setting time is gone
And she's batched eighteen chicks."
He mused upon it for awhile.
And then he said, 'Til bÂ«t
I've got the reason," with a smileâ
"The hen was overset."
Any night editor knows what that
means, but will hardly consider lt a
jesting matter.
The linotype machine inspires one of
the old school to hark back in tones of
regret:
These days we have the linotype.
Which casts us measures thin or thick;
We have no man who puffs his pipe
In unison with rapid click
Of type that clatters ln his stick
The while he scans his smudgy take.
We have no thumbs that feel the nick.
Nor pi that father used to make.
W e have no printers ot the stripe
That Used to brag of fingers quick.
Or swore when by some reckless swipe
Or by some careless, thoughtless trick
They gave the standing type a flick
That held destruction in Its wake.
We have no foreman choleric,
Nor pt like father used to make.
No tramp, whose nose is red and ripe,
Comes In at manuscript to kick.
And puzzledly his brow to wipe.
While from the copy he will pick
The words and say: "This makes me sick!"
Machines have followed ln his wake.
That do the work like laying briek â
No pi like father used to make.
L'ENVOI.
Prince Progress holds us ln his gripe.
Give us again for old time's sake
A surcease from the linotype
And d 1 like father used to make.
The editorial writer, the real voice of
the press, does not escape a bit of sat
ire. This is what he is supposed to say
!in his sleep after a heavy day's work:
LisUn to me. I am the editorial. In the
! columns of the Brobdingnagian Tribune I tell
the people what's what. I make 'em sit dp.
I I am the ' War During the Week" and in
i lurid paragraphs I paint the grim havoc of
I the combat where the shells go bang. I am
I "The Business Situation." I am the terror
Ito the trusts and when I roar the frenzied
â  financiers of Wall street go hide.
When I begin to shout their stocks go biff.
I I assist Roosevelt ln building the navy. Be
| ware, you Congressmen who dare vote to
cut down the navy for the sake of getting a
' meaaley little Federal building for your Jerk
water Town.
Sometimes I murmur in a "Flow Gently,
Sweet Afton" sort of tune and then look out,
for in the next column I may make the
earth tremble, while kings quake and the
hoary old globe gets scared and thinks it's
going to everlasting smash.
The magazine was published at a
dinner held by the staff of the Chicago
Tribune on January 1 and read during
the evening.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.âThe House Com
mittee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce

HANNAH ELIAS
TALKS FREELY
Negress on the Stand Tells
of the Many Gifts Made
to Her by John E. Piatt
SAYS HE WAS GENEROUS
Becites Story of Her Low
Life and Asserts Million
aire Gave Voluntarily
â¢
NEW YORK, Jan. 18.âHannah Eliaa,
the negress wb>om aped John R. Piatt
is suing to compel her to return $685,
--000 which he claims she extorted from
him during an acquaintance of twenty
years, to-day told the story of her llfÂ«
before Justice O'Gorman in the Supreme
Court, where the suit is on trial. It was
an extraordinary tale of sudden eleva
tion from the lowest and most vicloua
surroundings to a position of affluence,
where money was rained upon her and
where she had everything that great
wealth could provide.
She declared that she had nothing
to conceal and insisted that every dol
lar that Piatt gave her had been given
voluntarily. She believed, she said,
that she was under no obligation to re
turn any part of the money which she
now possesses. How much money
Piatt gave her she could not say, even
approximately, as she never kept any
account of his gifts, which were made
ln large sums at frequent intervals dur
ing their long acquaintance. Piatt was
very generous, even from the first, she
said, but he became more so after the
death of his wife in 1893. He told her
at that time that he wanted to provide
for her handsomely and explained .that
if he mentioned her in his will a con
test might result.
Mrs. Ellas apparently made no at
tempt to cover the details of her early
life. She admitted that she had served
two terms in prison, one in Philadel
phia for larceny and the other ln this
city for disorderly conduct.
It developed during thÂ« examina
tions of witnesses to-day that Mrs.
Elias had distributed her easily ac
quired wealth with a free hand among
those who had been of assistance to
her. Lawyer C. Nanz said she had
paid him $20,000 in fees; Lawyer Wash
ington Braun secured from her more
than $10,000 in fees. Other witnesses
fold of large sums paid for services of
comparatively trifling character.
When the defense rested a lawyer
representing the banks, that were
brought into the case by an order of
court directing them not to dispose of
moneys in their possession belonging
to Mrs. Elias, asked for a dismissal of
the order and the Judge granted the
request.

excused by Judge Murasky. He will
be placed on the stand to-day. The
remainder of the day was given over
to the hearing of Edmund Freund,
who acted as bookkeeper at the ware
house at Crockett for ten years.
Freund testified that he had the
care of the books, which have since
disappeared, and that the last he saw
of them was when they lay on the
warehouse wharf, wrapped up for
supposed shipment the day before the
failure. He said, however, that he
kept no books in which any reference
had been made to any warehouse re
ceipts held by banks and did not
know that such receipts were in ex
istence.
Freund went on to describe his
marking of the various piles of grain
under the Instructions of Superintend
ent Demings and said that he could
identify all piles marked by him, pro
vided that his memory was refreshed
by reference to a memorandum book
he compiled at the time. a long ar
gument between counsel took place
over the admission of the book, but
the witness was allowed to refer to it,
It then developed that many of the
piles of tgrain had two lot numbers on
them and the witness was unable to
Identify the markings on all the lots.
Freund will be on the stand at this
morning's session.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Continued heavy trading in local Stocks and Bonds. *
New York Stocks not materially changed. Cotton lower.
Silver and Excltangc exhibit slight variations.
II heat firm and tending upward. Barley steady.
Large Oriental orders for Barley, Oats and Hay reported.,

Butter firm, Cheese easy and Eggs selling more freely.
â¢'Potatoes higher. Onions firm. Southern Vegetables weak.
â Poultry market still firm, but Game rather slow.
Apples still active and Oranges moving rather better.
Quotations for Grain Bags show some alterations.
Cotton.
Brokers' wires from New York yesterday
said: The settlement of the strike at Fall
Riyfer should stimulate the market for cotton,
as these mills consume about 400,000 bales a
r , v -vi-.. but up to the present time they have
taker, pnuticaily nothing. It seems now that
We.are to speculate whether the producer will
throw over his actual cotton at a losa or
whether future operations will advance to a
.. parity, lt doe* not look reasonable that the
farmer, unless compelled to, will part with
the actual cotton at a price which shows him
â  a loss on the actual cost to raise It.
â¢ â¢ Thp Weather and Crops.
The weekly report of A. G. McA'dlo. section
' director of the olimate and crop service of
â¢ ihe Weather Bureau, Is as follows:
j ' GENERAL SUMMARY.
Cloudy and foggy weather prevailed in nearly
all sections most of the week, with light io
heAvy frosts at the beginning and higher tem
perature 'at the close. Frequent and heavy
rains occurred in all parts Of the - State, cage
.ntj high water in some of the northern dis
tricts, bnt with no serious damage to crops.
It Is reported that prompt measures will be
taken by the State authorities to prevent the
recurrence of flood damage in the vicinity of
â¢Sacramento, where the imperfectly repaired
levels are again causing uneasiness.
Grain and feed have been greatly benefited
by the generous rainfall, especially ln the
â¢ southern districts, where crop prospects are ,
paid to'be much better than at this time last
year. Oraln Is in good condition and making
satisfactory growth in all sections, and the
acreage in wheat, barley and oats Is being
raprdlv Increased. No material damage has
been done by frosts, though growth has been
somewhat slow during the cool weather. Pas
turage, of good quality la abundant in all sec
tions and cattle are doing well. The present
outlook is most favorable for excellent crops
of grain and hay ln all parts of the Btate.
Oranges in Southern California and the
' Cloverdale district have not been seriously. In
jured by frost, and the crop Is turning out
rosy well in both places; picking and shipping
have" been somewhat rearded by the continuous
rains. lemons are yielding an excellent crop
In Soufliern California. The work of pruning
and planting trees and vines continues.
- SACRAMENTO VALLEY. âWarm and
â  cloudy weather prevailed most of the week.
â¢ with frequent rains, which were quite heavy
â¢ In the northern districts and accompanied by
snow in the mountains. The continued rains
are causing some apprehension In the districts
flooded sy high waters last season, especially
where the levees are Imperfectly repaired, and
It \ls probable some action will soon be taken
by the State authbritles to guard against
â¢ future losses. Farm work has been somewhat
retarded by the rain, but pruning is progress
ing* in vineyards and orchards. Grain and
feed are in excellent condition and making
rapid growth.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.âThe cool
ana frosty weather at the beginning of the
â¢week was followed by higher temperature and
â  heavy rain in nearly all sections. At Healds
burg the precipitation for thlrty-elx hours was
6,25 inches and some damage was done by
â¢ high water. The rainfall was lighter in the
southern' districts, but was ample for present
'purposes. Plowing and seeding are progress
. Ing, except in a few places where the soli l_s
too wet. Grain is making rapid growth and
looks strong and healthy. Pasturage Is plen
tiful ln all sections and cattle are In good
ofidicion. Frosts have caused no material
' damage. - - - Â»- -
' SAN- JOAQUIN VALLEYâThe Weather dur
ing the past week was generally cloudy, with
.frequent foggy' mornings, and showers in the
â¢ first part of the week and again Sunday and
â¢ Sunday night. These conditions have been
very; beneficial to all growing crops and fa
vorable .for. plowing and seeding. A large
acreage will be sown to grain. Barly sown
grain Is making good growth. Green feed Is
fdeptiful and stock are healthy and in good
..condition. Pruning and cultivating orchards
and vineyards are progressing. Heavy frost
. occurred generally on the 12th, but no damage
Is reported. A large and excellent crop of
oranges has been harvested.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.âWarm and
'cloudy weather prevailed most of the week,
with- frequent heavy rains. The rainfall at
San Diego for eighteen days ending on the
14th was 3.74 inches, and other sections prob
ably have received as much or more. The soil
is in good condition and farm work is pro
gressing rapidly. Early sown grain and wild
. -oat's are up and making good progress. Pros
pacts for full crops are much better than at
this time last year. Range grass Is becoming
plentiful and stock are Improving. Orange
picking has been delayed by the rain, but the
fruit has not been Injured.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.âFarming op
erations are progressing with vigor since gen
, eral, well-distributed rains. Range feed Is
growing nicely and stock are doing better.
Early" sown grain Is coming up.
EUREKA SUMMARY âThe weather for the
past week was cloudy; moderately warm.
Farmers continue plowing and seeding spring
grain. Oats and grass ln excellent condition
and growing rapidly. Outlook for crops was
never, better at this season of the year.

New York Stock Market.
; NEW YORK, Jan. 18.âTha volume of the
. stock market expanded again to-day and some
ot the movementa were excited and sensational
but the activity was even more congested than
the recent tendency ln that direction and the
genera! level of prieea was not much more
benefited than yesterday. In other words, it
wr* clear that the effort was made to take
adf a/itage of the etimulatlng effect of the j
â¢ cxtited advances to sell stocks in other quar- I
ters of the market. It might almost be said i
of Reading that 5000 shares was the normal |
tmlt of the transactions In lt so frequent I
waa the appearance of 5000-share lots on the j
tape. The total outstanding laaue of Reading |
common stock amounts to 1,400.000 shares. It !
â¢ is- known that a large part of these have been j
taken out of the market and distributed to I
. different railroad companies to insure the bal- j
â¢aj.ee of control of this property, although the
controlling Interest Is believed to depend more
"on preferred stock holdings than on the com- |
mop,' But Reading has often given evidence j
of the large reduction of Its floating supply. !
Sales for a single day of 516,000 shares, which
' w/is the total reached to-day. may be safely |
assumed to represent a large proportion of
matched orders and manipulative transactions.
Probably the â¢ manifest character of the opera
tions- accounted for their lack of effective in
.' fluence on the general list. The entire lack
oi,nÂ«ws to account fcr the movement and the
high-level to which the price had already been
lifted considering the dividend return, helped
to beget doubt for the movement and fears
fbf* the maintenance of the prlce-levl. The
movement in Ontario and Western especially
ami- in the other coaiers to a less degree was )
Kut-posed to be sympathetic and was equally
without explanation In the news of the day.
. TTu- news was not lacking In favorable factors,
. but did not apply especially to the stocks
w&fth â¢ moved most widely. The action of the
conservative Illinois Central directors In de
claring an extra dividend on their stock went
fnr .to confirm the encouraging" effect of other
recetit increases in dividend disbursements aa |
aftewfng the confidence of railroad manager*
ln the future prosperity of their properties.
The resafttttg revival of dividend hopes was
perceptible in the movements In Baltimore find
Ohio, Kansas and Texas preferred. Chesapeake
snd. Ohio, Smelting and perhaps in some other
sft'cks. The announcement of the settlement
of the Fall River strike was received with
grntifjcatlon as serving to clear up the situa
tion In one of the few industrial quarters
Whtch has lagged ln the trade expansion. The
shs.otptj.on qf two minor railroads which have
bscr. within Its sphere of Influence by the New
Yark, Centra! gave some early strengtn to the
stock. The whole list gave way. however,
wRh some violence ln the last hour whea tho
suepiclons engendered by the character W the i
day's trading Und come to a head. Th#.fall-
Irq off of upward of $45,000,000 in
balance ln our favor for _l>ecembeT,. dCc both
to increased imports and tbe heavy decline to
exports, was not regarded as a cheerful ahow
ltig aad gavo promise of the continued ability
of the world's outside markets to draw our
gold supply. The market rallied with con
siderable force in the final dealings, led by
Baltimore and Ohio with a rise of 1%, and
thi- closing was quite strong, but only a frac
tion generally above the lowest.
Bonds were active and firm. Total sales,
par value, $6,000,000.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 18.âFrom start to finish the
wheat market exhibited considerable strength
At tbe opening May was %Â®-%c higher at
$1 15%Â©1 15%. The Initial strength was due
mainly to the comparative firmness of the
Liverpool market. Just after the opening a
feeling of hesitation developed on selling
brought out by Increased receipts ln the North
west. Under these offerings May sold off to
$1 15%. A more careful analysts of conditions
ln the Northwest, however, reveale/1 the fact
that a large percentage of to-day's arrivals at
Minneapolis was wheat brought from country
elevators at last week's prices, and that there
was little likelihood of any material Increase
ln the movement from farms. This explanation
relieved the bears ot their principal ammunition
and started fair covering by many of the early
sellers. Lack of offerings caused a quick ad
vance in the prices, and for the remainder of
the session the market held strong. The high
point on May was reached at $1 16%. Final
quotations were at $1 16%@1 16%.
Smallness of receipts gave the corn market a
strong start, and, although trading was not
of large volume, a firm undertone was mani
fested throughout the day.
The volume of business in oats was very
small and the strength of other grains held
prices firm. May opened a shade higher at
81 %c and closed unchanged.
Provisions opened-firm on an advance of 6c
in the price of hogs, but eased off on selling
by packers. At the close May pork and ribs
were each off 2%Â®5c and lard was down 2%c.

Hay and Fcedstnffs.
The British steamer Tottenham is loading
1000 tons of Hay for either Russia or Japan.
The market rules easy, with the rains and
green feed exerting a weakening Influence on
quotations, which, however, are not actually
lower. Feeds tuffs show no change.
The circular of Somers A Co. says:
"During the past week 3820 tons of Hay
have been offered on our market, an amount
greater by 980 tons than was received the
week before. The slightly active demand has
j fallen off considerably, and this, with the un
| settled weather conditions, has caused the
market to be very* quiet. Consignees are still
holding out for former figures, but buyers are
well stocked up and seem unwilling to pay
the prices asked.
"During the week there has been psactic&lly
nothing of interest to report; trade continues
dull and the market seems to be determined,
not by general conditions, but by the dally
supply and demand. The Government Is now
taking about one thousand tons' for the Phil
ippine Islands, but this is counteracted by the
lack of other export and coastwise shipping.
"The recent rain, which has extended well
Into the south, has caused the farmers down
there to let go their holdings, so that district
will not have to draw very heavily on our
stocks, although lt will probably continue to
do so to some extent.
"Prices have shown little change for some
time past."

STOCK MARKET.
Continued Activity and Firmness on
the Bond Exchange.
It was another brisk and Interesting day on
the Stock and Bond Exchange, with plenty of
; snap to the market, which seemed full of <
orders. The list of transactions was extended
and varied. The advance In the sugars was
less pronounced, though Onomea rose two
i points to $37. and Makawell and Honokaa

: the day and Honolulu sold off to $34 75 on
the morning session, recovering to $35, how- {
! ever, ln the afternoon. There were no sales

â¢ clal affairs at the special meeting on Tuesday
1 evidently gave a better complexion to the com
pany's stock, for lt strengthened considerably,
' rising to $90, against a closing price of
$86 62% the previous day, though the dealings
!ln it were not large. Dealings ln bonds were
j active, amounting to $111,000.
The mining shares also came In for a very
fair volume of trading, bat showed no special
' features. The oil stocks continued quiet.

of California.
Mr. Dwyer has cited authorities ga

conducted by Charles S. Wheeler, at

will continue this morning at 10:30
o'clock. His testimony was on the same

' lerk, was on the stand for a few
minutes yesterday afternoon. He
brought his long minute book with him
and gave testimony regarding the date
and time of probating the famous will.
During the afternoon session a short
. cess was taken to allow Expert
Dwyer to lo&k up some references in
i he mass of books he had brought with
!>im. The interim was spent by the
legal lights present telling a number
of witty stories. Consul Bennett and
Attorney Wheeler were particularly
happy in their efforts.

WOMEN'S NEGLECT
SUFFERINGTHE SURE PENALTY
Health Thus Lost Is Restored by Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
How many women do you know who
are perfectly well and strong? We
hear every day the same story over and
over again. "I do not feel well; lam
so tired all the time!"
More than likely you speak the same
words yourself, and no doubt you feel
far from well. The cause may he easily
traced to some derangement of the fe
male organs which manifests itself in
depression of spirits, reluctance to go
anywhere or do anything, backache,
â  a ring-down pains, flatulency, nerv
'-ness, sleeplessness, leucorrhoaa.
These symptoms are but warnings
thai there is danger ahead, and unless
deeded a life of suffering or a serious
: ; >p ration is the inevitable result.
The never-failing remedy for all these
symptoms is 'Lydia E. Pinkham's Veg
etable Compound.
Miss Kate McDonald, of Wood bridge,
N. J., writes:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham:
'' I think that a woman naturally fIMBMs to
make her troubles known to the public, but
restored health has meant so much to me that
I cannot help from telling mine for the sake
of other suffering women.
" For a-long time I suffered untold agony
with a uterine trouble and irregularities,
n hich made me a physical wreck, and no one
i bought I would recover, but Lydia E. Pink
ham's Vegetable Compound has entirely
cured me, and made me well and strong, and
I feel it my duty to tell other suffering women
what a splendid medicine it is. '
If you are ill, don't hesitate to get a
bottle of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegeta
:>le Compound at once, and write to
Mrs. Pinkham, Lynn, Mass., for special
adviceâit is free and always helpful.

MAKING READY
FOR THE SHOW
Nucleus of the California
Lewis and Clark Exhibit
Is Unloaded at Portland
The nucleus of the California exhibit
for the Lewis and Clark Fair, which
is to open next July at Portland, Or.,
has been unloaded at its destination,
under the direction of Commissioner J.
A. Filcher, who went nc-*h some days
ago for that purpose. Architects have
prepared drawings for the .building
that California may erect if the Legis
lature appropriates the money needed.
The drawings will be considered by
Governor Pardee, together with esti
mates of cost. These steps mark the
beginning of t v - work to have Califor
nia advertised ln the Northwest during
the coming Portland show.
Three carloads of California exhibits
have been sent to Portland to date.
These are what remained as available
material for show purposes when the
State display at St. Louis was closed at
the end of the Louisiana Purchase Ex
position. Altogether, forty-seven car
loads of material went from California
to St. Louis. Fifteen carloads were re
turned to this State. Three are in Port
land. The contents of tne other cars
have been variously dispersed. The
wine collection at St. Louis was sold
and so were the dairy exhibits and
parts of the forestry exhibit. Perish
able fruits that went to St. Louis and
also printed matter relating to Califor
nia and its Industries and resources
were Â»glven away. The three carloads
of exhibits that are in Portland repre
sent a part of the State's educational,
forestry, horticultural and agricultural
show In the Middle West.
Commissioner Filcher went to Port
land at the request of Governor Pardee
to take the necessary steps in advar.c*
of action by the Legislature, to see that
the exhibits ln hand should be properly
made ready. Secretary George A. Den
nison of the California Commission to
the St. Louis Exposition has opened an
office in the Palace Hotel in this city
and is engaged ln winding up the St.

SEEKS HACKMAN'S ARREST
John Gavin Accused by E. G. Pierce
of Violating Ordinance by Inter
fering With Funeral.
E. G. Pierce, proprietor of the Ne
vada stables. 1350 Market street, ob
tained a warrant from Police Judge
Cabaniss yesterday for the arrest of
John Gavin, a hackman, on a charge
of interfering with a funeral. , The
arrest is sought under an ordinance
"prohibiting the disturbance of 1 pro
cessions."
Pierce was accompanied by Attor
ney Bush Finnell, who represents the
Citizens' Alliance. He alleges that last
Friday Gavin refused to drive a hearse
at a funeral on Mission street, between
Seventh and Eighth, thereby blocking
the procession. The reason given was
that lt had been discovered that one
of the men driving a hack did not be
long to the union. It was necessary
to procure a union hackman to take
the place of the non-union man be
fore Gavin would consent to drive the
hearse further.

it fully effective.
The grain board and the marine de
partment will be housed on the main
floor in the rear. Various new facilities
for the transaction of business and
the perfecting of the service of the
marine department have been provided,
especially ln the telegraph and in pos

"COUGH FOR THE DOCTOR, DARLING"
Beware of a cough, especially of infants and delicate children.
Don't wait until the cough becomes hard, the throat inflamed, the
lungs and bronchial passages congested. Avoid cough remedies
that contain opiates, stupefying drugs and dangerous anodynes.
They only quiet the symptoms âdrug the cough into silenceâbut
that is not curing. A weak place is left to cause trouble later.
A remedy must be used to subdue the inflammation, stimulate the
secretions, soothe and heal the irritated membranes, and cure the
cough to stay cured.

CLUNIE BATTLE
RAGES IN COURT
Judge Bridgford Intimates
That He May Settle His
Rights on the Outside
AVHITE NOTE IS PAID
One of Items in Objections
to Executor's Account Is
Corrected by Bank Check
Bitter feeling, sharp questions and 1
answers, and an implied threat marked
yesterday's continuation of the exam- !
ination of E. A. Bridgford by Andrew I
J. Clunie In the hearing in Judge Cof
fey's court on the objections to the ex
ecutors' account of their administra
tion of the estate of Thomas J. Clunie.
When the antagonists began to show
their unfriendliness Judge Coffey I
sought to change their course by sug- ;
gestlng that the words they were in- i
dulging in had already led to the pub
lication of personal matter that should
not have been dragged through the j
courts. I
"I am' as reluctant as any one to |
drag these things through the court," ;
said Mr. Clunie, "but I cannot see my
property taken away without object
ing."
Judge Bridgford glared at his accuser ,
and said menacingly:
"There have been insinuations all
through these proceedings, and if I
cannot protect my rights in court I will i
settle them outside."
"I hope you won't injure me," !
1 chimed Clunie mockingly, while Judge
Coffey begged to assure Bridgford that
his rights would be protected.
The examination proceeded and there |
were other flashes at times. When the j
question of the note of B. G. White, â 
the other executor, which had not been
included in the report, was brought up,
Bridgford announced that White had
paid the note with a check for $4088
yesterday morning. Bridgford had not |
had time to bank it and handed it over
to Clunie, who indorsed it as one of
the executors. White had explained
that this note was security for a Har
court note which had been mentioned
in the account, so the matter was not
really omitted. Clunie contends that i
it was not a collateral note but a per
sonal obligation.
The question of the payment of $8000
to Judge Grant for legal services waa,j
again taken up, and Bridgford went j
through Grant's statement of services.
Item by item, while Clunle checked
off the papers mentioned and of- J
fered comment as he went. The
clause in the Clunie will providing
that the three executors, all of whom j
were lawyers, should choose one of i
their own number as attorney for the
estate, was construed by Bridgford as
a mere provision to guarantee that
such attorney should be paid in addi
tion to his fee as executor for legal
services, if he so acted.
The hearing was cut short in the af- !
ternoon to permit D. M. Delmas to
make a statement of tiis services to the
trustees of the estate. The matter is
I not involved in the present controversy,
1 but Delmas had other engagements.
He explained that he had advised the
trustees tor a period of six weeks re- :
garding Mrs. Clunie's claim for her j
Share of the community property,
which he concluded could never pre-
VÂ«JI, and regarding Andrew Clunie's
contentions regarding the Invalidity
of the trust clause in the will, which
he concluded were partly right and'
partly wrong. The two questions in
volved about $450,000 of the estate, and U
Mr. Delmas thought his services were |
reasonably worth $7500. Judge Coffey
will pass upon the matter later. r

PAUPER'S OATH
RESCUES PIPER
Shipping Man GeKÃelease
From Jail by Swearing
That He Is Now Penniless
Arthur Leroy Piper, ex-secretary of
the Piper-Aden-Goodall Company and
at one time the owner of $30,000 worth
of its stock, took the t-uper's oath
in Judge Sloss's court yesterday morn
ing in order to get out of jail. He also
told the court that his wife did not
know that he was in prison and did
not believe he was there until
she visited him recently. Then
she declared that she did not want him
incarcerated and desired his release.
Mrs. Piper was in court when these
statements were made and acquiesced
by her silence, whereupon Judge Sloss
ordered the shipping man discharged
from custody. Piper insisted that he
had no funds and ha<\ to borrow
money Tor current expenses. He said
that his $30,000 worth of stock was
pledged to the limit. The court be
lieved that under these circumstances
there would be no good in confining
him longer, but suggested there could
be further imprisonment for future
delinquencies in the payment of ali
mony. He thought Piper should show
good faith by making an effort to pay j
something on the $625 now due his
wife and this he promised to do. It
appears that Mrs. Piper's mother is
in good circumstances and Mrs. Piper
is not suffering for lack of life's neces
sities. 4
Depositions were received and read
yesterday in Judge Kerrigan's court in
the divorce case of D. D. Griffiths, who
accused his wife of Infidelity with
James Keane of the Keane Theatrical
Company, of which she was the man
ager. The evidence of a saloon-keeper
and a lodging-house keeper at Blue
Lake, where the company played,
tended to support the husband's
charge and the Judge took the case
under advisement. Judge Seawell also
had a theatrical case on his hands and
took under submission the evidence
of Martha E. Braham, who charged
Louis Braham. a member of the Great
Western Vaudeville Troupe. with
cruelty and neglect. They were mar
ried in September last and the cruelty
began a few days after the wedding.
Divorce was granted by Judge
Murasky to Isabelle Gavin from Mi- |
chael J. J. Gavin, neglect; by Judge
Troutt to Dora Siewert from Harry A.
Siewart, desertion; by Judge Kerrigan
to Clara B. Fleming from Walter S.
Fleming, desertion.
New suits for separation were begun
by William J. Tate against Belle Tate, j
desertion and cruelty; Irma C. Baler j
against Henry Baier, cruelty and ne- j
gleet; E. Johnson against Mrs. E.
Johnson, desertion. In the latter case, j
in which there is an apparent effort to
hide the identity of the parties, the J
complaint says that they were married
in London in 1868 and the wife de
serted more than two years ago.

he wanted $500 in a hurry. He
