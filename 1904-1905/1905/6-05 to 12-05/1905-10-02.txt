Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. I.â lt was stated
to-day that Attorney General Mayer
had made demand upon John A. Mc-
Call that he return to the treasury of
the New York Life Insurance Company
$50,000 which he contributed to the Re
publican campaign fund. It was fur
ther stated that McCall had peremptor
ily refused to make restitution.
Attorney General Mayer was at his
camp in the Adirondacks and could
not be reached. President McCall's
reticence when questioned lends prob
ability to the report. McCall was seen
at his summer home, Shadow Lawn, at
Long Branch. He said. ". T ,do not care
to discuss any matters now uefore the
legislative committee until my testi
mony is completed."
It was reported to-day that subpena
servers of the legislative insurance

lantic States, working-in conjunction
with Judge Hamilton.
Thummell has made no effort to
avoid service, he declares. He was In
his apartments at Britton Hall to-day.
When seen there he declined to dis
cuss the questions before the commit
tee at its session of Friday, in which
his name was mentioned as legislative
representative of the three companies.
Maine testified that the
had made payments to Timinmell un
der general instructions of the con
troller. Thummell was assistant to the
late E. L. Short, who was the general
solicitor of the Mutual for many years.
It was explained oy Maine in his tes
timony that by an organized sj-stem
the three life insurance companies di
vided equally the expenses of Judge
Hamilton, Short and Thummell.
Prosecutor Hughes in his examina
tion this week is expected to bring to
light further facts relating to the deal
in Chicago and Alton 3% per cent re

NEW YORK. Oct. I.â Locked up In po
lice headquarters, with his full confession
In the possession of Captain John Me-
Cauley, is the young man. who, by means
of a forged check, last Wednesday ob
tained from the National City Bank se
curities valued at $359,000. He was ar
rested at 11 o'clock this morning, just as
he stepped from his home and was on
his way to church. Four hours later,
after he had defeated every effort of
Captain McCauley and George S. Dough
erty, superintendent of the Pinkerton
Detective Agency, to persuade him to
confess, he broke down and. In 'a flood
tears, told the complete story of his
crime. '/ \u25a0-> :: Â«r; , " \
Captain McCauley to-night had in his
possession more than one-half of the
stolen securities. The. remainder have
been located, . and will be in his hands
to-morrow. .
In order that the full ends of justice
may not be defeated, and because of the
fact that . the father and mother of the
young: man have not ._ been informed: of
hls^crime or j3f a JH3.arrftst^.hia_i>aineÂ»^at7,
the request ~of the authorities, is- with
held. He has not,. been connected v with
the National ..' City Bank, .which' 'was
robbed, nor with Pearl &â¢- Co., the firm of
bankers, which had hypothecated ,wlth
the bank the securities that .were-pur
loined.
He has for several years^ been transfer
clerk in one of the best-known -brokerage
firms- in Wall street. He is> 24 years old,
and has been regarded by his employers
and by his friends as a model of pro
priety and honesty. His position was
one of responsibility and trust. His en
gagement to a young woman, \ we,ll
known in society circles of this city, was
recently announced, and he was soon to
have been married.
According to the confession her signed
this evening the crime was all his own
from its inception to its execution. ' He'
had made arrangements to dispose of the
stock and bonds which he had stolen, but
at the time of his arrest not one of them
had been hypothecated by him.
The young man who ; set the entire
banking world of \ the country by the
ears, and who was at least' partly suc
cessful in the greatest robbery that has
been done in more than two decades, in
appearance is little more than a school
boy.

EjjecUJ Dispatch to TJie CalL
SVASHINGTON. Oct. I.â -The battleship
Mississippi, which was launcaed yester
day. at Cramp's shipyard in Philadelphia,
Is practically obsolete. Alinough enter
ing the water now for tbe first time, she
is outclassed by vessels built eight and
ten years ago. Deficient in speed, inferior
In size and with a very limited coal
capacity, the Mississippi will be unable
to take her proper place with modern
ships.
This statement is made oy a prominent
bureau chief of the Navy Department.
Similar declarations were made by other
naval officers, who freely condemn the
Mississippi and her sister ship, the Idaho,
v.'hich is also .building at Cramp's ship
yard, i ,
The Mississippi has a tonnage of only
iCOOO, whereas leading European nations
â¢ are building battleships of J6.000 and IS.OOO
' torts. The greatest handicap of the new
. vessel is in speed. She is built to develop
only seventeen knots an hour. As one
bureau chief said today: "This puts the
Mississippi into tbe obsolete class."
BOYS IN BLUE
SAVING MONEY
.WASHINGTON. Oct. I.â The report of
Frarcis A. S. Dodge, the paymaster gen
eral of the army, for tbe fiscal year,
points out that the enlisted men have now
every chance to put away money for
.their own savings by the deposit system,
which guarantees them absolute safety.
During the last year the amount de
posited by the men was 51,531,020. making
j the total amount since the establishment
.of the system $26,294,236.
Dodge states that the present
laws against' permanent appointments in
, tbe staff corps and In departments will
result in course of time in all the grades
in the pay department being filled by of
ficers detailed from the line. He rec
ommends that the law be amended so as
to "limit details to vacancies occurring in
'the grade of captain ror which captains
of the line should be selected as now, and
'.bat all grades above captain should be
made permanent appointments.
The amount exi>ended on account of
the pay of the army during the year was
$31,361,122.
The last complete pay schedule for the
army was passed by Congress thirty-five
ago and the report contends that
it is not sufficient for the demands of
our times. The fact that the army is un
deYpaid, the report adds, makes it Im
possible to recruit out of such classes as
might be wished.

is posltvely no danger."
But the heavy seas rocked the ves
sel and the lifeboat was ordered
launched. Fire women were lowered
Into the boat and pulled ashore through
the breakers. A utiff breeee was blow
ing: and the surf was rolling high. The
rocks on vrhicb tbe Santa Barbara
struck are nt the base of a. high cliff
and the landing wan perilous. Several
times the breakers threatened to over
whelm the Jlfeboat.
White and dumb with terror the
women clung: to the side of the little
lifeboat, expecting at any moment to
be thrown Into the boiling surf and
drowned. One of them, Mrs. J. Folset
of Los Angeles, held a tiny baby in
her arms.
WOMEN LANDED FIRST.
The women, drenched to the skin, were
finally landed on a tiny stretch of beach.
They- were weak from- the terrible ex
perience they bad passed through. The
male passengers were landed soon after
ward.
Meanwhile the Santa Barbara had been
sounding signals of distress. Tbe Sea
Foam was the first vessel to catch the
signals. She launched her boats and took
the passengers aboard. The Porno, the
Punta Arena and the . Phoenix were at
tracted to the scene.
The thrae vessels passed out hawsers
to the Santa Barbara, and tried to pull
her off, but even their concentrated ef
forts were fruitless. It was compara
tively low tide when the Santa Barbara
struck and It was decided to wait for high
tide. At high tide the three vessels again
tugged at the Santa Barbara. This time
she was pulled from the rocks with a
great hole in her bow. Latest advices
from Del Mar are that the Santa Bar
bara is being towed to this port by the
Punta Arena and tbe Porno. She is
leaking badly.
The following passengers from San
Francisco were brought back on the Sea
Fawn: R. -Antoni, "William Donnelly, R.
A- Warwick, James D. "Wilson, Mrs. J.
D. "Wilson. E. Meland and Edward Fran
cis. Mrs. J." Foiset and her baby were
also on tbe Sea Foam. ,
CAPTAIN STAYS ABOARD.
The Santa Barbara carried a crew of
eighteen. There were 6oven in ..the en
gine room, seven deck hands and four in
the steward's department
The Santa Barbara left her* Saturday
morning for Seattle on her" regular run.
She passed out through the Golden Gate
Juet a little while before the' Alaraeda
went upon the rocks at Fort Point. The
Santa Barbara ran into the same fog
bank that brought disaster to the big
liner, only to run into as grave a danger
later on.
The crew of the Santa Barbara are in
clined to be reticent about the affair.
They say that they encountered little
fog after they got outside the Potato
Patch. The weather was comparatively
clear when she struck upon the rocks.
Captain Zaddart refused to leave the
ship after she struck, though for a while
It looked as if she were doomed. He
insisted that she could be towed off.

STRIKES AT DAWN.
When the Santa Barbara struck on the
rocks the sun was just beginning to rise
over the distant hills and the weather
was clear, not a cloud marring the azure
blue of the sky. The sea was as smooth
as glass and the good ship was riding
easily, with the captain in his bunk and
the second mate at the wheel. All tho
passengers were in bed and none of them
knew tha ship, was on .the rocks -till
awakened and told to get ready to leave
In the lifeboats. , k -f ':-.\u25a0":
A panic was narrowly averted when the
steward was making the rounds of the
staterooms, giving the alarm that the
ship had struck a rock. Women jumped
out of their bunks and ran out on the
decks, crying for aid. Some of the
calmer male passengers wisely thought of
the lifeboats and were about to rush -for
them when they were informed that
everything . had been provided f or.,v, > Â»
As soon as the ship' struck, Captain
Zaddart was awakened and he assumed
command. He ordered* the lifeboats
launched and within half an hour after
the roiks were struck every passenger
had been safely landed on the adjacent
shore.
As all the passengers were asleep when
tbe "vessel struck, it was impossible for
any of them to give an accurate account
of the stranding. In the excitement
which followed, most of them forgot to
take bearings, each being intent on get
ting his belongings' together and hustling
into one of the waiting lifeboats as quick
ly as possible.
Mrs. Foiset of Los Angeles and her
eighteeir-months-old baby - boy were pas
sengers on the Santa Barbara. When she
was awakened by the steward her first
thought was of her Infant. Clutching
her babe In her arms, Mrs. Folset quickly
ran out on the deck and was there met
by one of the officers, who told her that
everything was all right. â¢
"We were all hustled into two lifeboats
and quickly rowed to the shore about a
hundred feet away," said Mrs. Foiset
last night. "There was absolutely no
panic on board the ship after she struck
and if the steward had not informed us
that we were high and dry -on the rocks
we should not have known what had
happened.
*"I was alarmed at first when I was
awakened, for people were, running
around the decks and every one seemed
excited. Captain Zaddart informed us
that there was no danger and not to
worry, as the lifeboats were- ready to
take us ashore. We * all landed in J the
boats without any difficulty and 'were
quickly rowed to Del Mar, where we were
taken care of till the steamer Sea Foam
came and carried us away."
"We did not know what had happened
till the ship had been on the rocks for
several minutes," said James D. Wilson
of this city, who, with his wife, ' was a
passenger bound for Seattle. ."Every
thing was conducted in an orderiy man
ner on board the ship and we were landed
on shore without much ceremony. -When
I went out on the deck the light of dawn
was just breaking and the sky was clear
as crystal. There was not ' a ripple on
the sea and I cannot understand how the
vessel struck the rocks."
Captain Miller, in charge of the steamer
Sea Foam, which brought the Santa Bar
bara's passenger* to this 'city,*, did not
board the distressed vessel' sending sev
eral members or his crew : instead. . Cap
tain Miller beard of the misfortune. to the
Santa Barbara when his ship touched at
Point Arena shortly after the \u25a0 accident.
"t do not know Just how. badly the
Santa Barbara is damaged." said Captain
Miller, "but I will venture to say ; they
will have a hard 7 time getting, her off the
rocks.' She appeared to me to be wedged
in very tight, and when' we left the scene
of the. wreck, the tide was fairly high,
yet there seemed little chanco ? of floatine
THE: SAN FRANCISCO CALL, - /\u25a0MOND&Yjft OCTOBER 2, -1905;
WORKMEN REFUSE
TO LEAVE SHIP
'Martinique Laborers for Pan
ama Canal Work Balk at
the /Sanitaiy Regulations
FIGHT WITH THE POLICE
Clubs Are Used to Drive Men
, Ashore and Condition;, of
Immigrants Is Pitiable
COLON, Oct. I.â Six hundred and fifty
laborers from Martinique brought here
Friday on the French steamer VersaUles.
under contract to work on the canal re
fused to disembark or to submit to vac
cination, which is imperative under the
American sanitary regulations. They
clamored to be taken back to .Martln
inque, asserting that they had been mis
informed as to the conditions here-be
fore they embarked, and that later they
learned these conditions were intolerable
and deadly. - . \u25a0
Yesterday morning, however, 500 of
them were with difficulty persuaded to
land, and these were sent to. points along
the line of the canal. One hundred and
fifty remained on board and declined to
leave the ship under <any consideration.
They were forcibly ejected from the ves
sel this afternoon by Panaman and canal
zone policemen, but not until nearly every
one of them had been clubbed, and sev
eral were bleeding from nasty wounds.
All of yesterday and last night the Ver
sailles was guarded by Panaman police
men. - i
Early this morning tbe French Consul
at Colon, M. Bonhenry. appealed jto the
men to listen to reason, explaining thai
they had left Martinique under contract
with the canal zone emigration agent
guaranteeing the payment of their pas
sage here, and that while working on the
canal they.' would have in addition to
their wages tbe guarantee of free quar
ters and free medical attendance. â¢ The
men, however, , were not answerable to
this reasoning.
â¢ MEN ARE OBSTINATE.
: Notwithstanding the efforts of the Con
sul, of the Panaman and American ofn
cials and despite the. information, given
them by several of their countrymen that
health and other conditions on the isth
mus were satisfactory and that the
terms of their employment would enable
them to save money, they persistently
refused to leave the ship, baring their
breasts and invoking death in preference
ot going ashore.
The captain of the Versailles, who, all
through the trouble displayed an extra
ordinary amount of patience, told the
men that he was ready to take back to
Martinique all those who were able | to.
pay their passage, but the men argued
that ihe French Government would be
willing to reimburse the steamship com
pany and that they themselves were pen
niless.
Before noon, at the Instance of M. Ra
voi, the agent of the company, and the
French Consul, with' a squad of twelve
police, went on board the vessel and told
the men that force would be used if they
persisted in their, refusal to disembark.
Seeing that the police were armed, with
bayonets and guns the men again bared
their breasts and said, t . they, preferred
death rather than be taken ashore. Gov
ernor Melendez, Mayor Aldron/ the.Chier
of Police^ and others' argued with the
men, but again without effect. '\u25a0^' ; '!y'
' POLICE BEGIN CLUBBING. "'\u25a0'-,'"
Ten additional policemen at the
wharf, but the Governor, wishing to
avoid bloodshed and considering that the
police force was insufficient, telegraphed
to President Amador, asking permission
to use the canal zone police, to which the
President consented.*' Meantime twelve
policemen from'ithe zone had arrived at
the dock and were being held in readi
ness. -
At 2 o'clock the laborers were informed
that they .would be given -two hours to
reconsider their decision, and at 4 o'clock
three of them cgnsented to disembark,
the others still holding- out. Then tha
Panaman police, armed with clubs, ap
proached the laborers and on their refus
ing to quit the ship began to club them
right and left.
The zone police a few minutes later as
sisted in the clubbing, but with better
judgment and less indiscriminately. About
fifty of the laborers leaped into the sea,
but all of the men were able to swim.
The captain, however, lowered a boat,
which picked them up. Nearly every man
had received blows and several of them
were bleeding from ugly ...wounds.
Seeing that resistance was useless, the
men yielded, came ashore and began to
eat the food that had been placed on the
dock in sight of them for several hours.
Many of them had not eaten since Sat
urday. At 5 o'clock all the laborers, .who
were in a pitiable condition, were placed
on board a train which left for Corozal,
where they wlllbe put to work.

Captain Dowdell was a very busy. man
yesterday. When asked his opinion re

said: "I cannot say mucn about the pos

to see her in- this position."
CRO'Wb'S' AT THE WRECK.
The scene of the wreck \was visited by
thousands of people yesterday. . The day
was . perfect. Early "in the morning great
crowds ' began wending their way "to . Fort
Point.- The big- dock In front of the old
fort was | soon jammed to its full capa
city. It was crowded so that no more
could find; a standing place there.' The
new arrivals then took to the- roof of. the
old brick fort. They perched along the
front of the casement, backed by hun
dreds who stood up.- craning their: necks
to get a view of. the big liner, which only
lay about 100 feet distant from the shore.
Finally the crowd got so great on . the
roof \u25a0: that Colonel Charles Morris, .the
commandant of the post at the Presidio,
was compelled ,to send â¢ down a" ; troop of
infantry to keep ..the crowd away from
the â¢ roof ', : as be was afraid the immense
weight of the . people would crush ,Â» it in.
Small numbers of . people wera, however,
allowed to remain there, while the guard
of soldiers paced slowly up and down in
their midst. ;
Besides the great throngs, that stood on
the fort and lined the shores, crowds
came out on the bay. : They, came in
every kind and style of water: craft
Launches, tugs",- steamers, yachtÃ, | sail
boats, row boats, shells and canoes, and,
in .fact, every .available kind :o: of \u25a0 boat' was
pressed j Into serv'lce and* each " had ; its ; full

IN DEPOT YARD
Pullman Sleepers Thrown
Into Gully at St. Paul
and One Passenger Dies
SEVERAL BADLY HURT
Nine of the Injured Are Re
moved to Hospitals While
a Score Are Sent Home
BTJ PAUL, Oct. I.â A Chicago and Great
Western stock train, running twenty
miles an hour, while going through the
St. Paul Railroad yards at 9:30 o'clock
this morning, struck the middle of a
"Soo" line passenger train, which had
Just left Union station, and hurled two
Pullman sleepers over a wall to the bot
tcm of a gully twenty feet below. One
( Eieeper landed bottom side. up. and the
other fell on Its side. Both cars were
badly wrecked. The wreckage caught fire,
but was extinguished promptly. One
woman was so badly injured that 'she
died at St. Joseph's Hospital shortly
after being taken ther*. and nine others
%vere seriously injured, while a score or
more were less seriously hurt.
The Soo train had arrived from Mont
real thirty minutes late, and was bound
for Minneapolis, running, so witnesses
say, about thirty miles an hour. As it
neared Fourth street the track on which
it was running leads to an inside double
ttaek. Here the engineer of the Soo
.ir&in sighted the Great Western cattle
train going to St. Paul stock yards and
heading for a split switch which con
nects the outside and inside tracks.
The engineer of the Great Western
train whistled for brakes, showing that
his air brakes were not working, and as
a warning to the Soo train, but it was
evidently not heard, as the Soo train
tailed to slacken. The engine and first
sleeper of the Soo train got safely across
the switch, but the second and third
sleepers were hit. The end of the fourth
sleeper was partially wrecked.
That no more were killed or injured
is due to the fact that the train was
nearly empty, having discharged the
greater number of its passengers at the
Tnion station here.
The dead:

NEW YORK, Oct. Lâ Senator Platt de
clared war to-night on Governor Higglns.
saying he was uncompromisingly opposed
to his renomination. His attack caused a
sensation among the Republican leaders.
"I am against Higgins for another term
under any and all circumstances," he
said. "I wrote 35.000 letters for him to my
friends throughout the State when he
was a candidate for Governor, and I nev
er asked but one favor of him. That was
that he approve a bill which was passed
by the Legislature for this hotel. I asked
it thoughtfully and prayerfully. He ve
toed It."
Senator Platt alluded to a speoial act
which would have enabled the Gotham
Hotel to obtain a liquor tax certificate,
although it is within 200 feet of a church.
"What did you mean by saying in
Washington that it would be worth while
to live through the next State cam
paign?" the Senator was asked.
"You know what I meant as well as I
do," the Senator said.
"Why did the Republican organization
turn its back so suddenly on municipal
ownership?" was asked.
"I don't know," the Senator replied,
"unless It was one of Odell's vagaries."
Senator Platt would not discuss the in
surance investigation, saying that he had
not read the testimony.
"Did your State committee get any of
McCall's money?" was asked.
"Not that I know of," the Senator re
plied.

MEXICO CITY, Oct. I.â Explorations
made at an old Toltec pyramid on ; the
Magueyltos hacienda in the. State of
Puebla have disclosed the fact that the
structure was ; built" of clay bricks,
which proves It to be far older than
the Aztec monarchy and possibly older
even than the Toltec occupation of the
country. Several elaborately carved
figures were found, representing men in
Chinese dress, and with marked Chi

represented warriors. Antiquarians are

ARE FAVOTITES
/â¢Sauce for the Gander" Gives

FRANZ EBERT AS CUPID
Veteran Lilliputian Is as
Funny as in Years Past
in His Imitation "Jag"
"Sauce for the gander" plquantly
served in "A Timely Awakening" gives
Carleton Macy and Maud Edna Hall the
opportunity of this week's Orpheum bill.
It is the old story of a recalcitrant hus
band and a rebellious wife, only the hus
band merely dreams the lady of the cig
arette and cocktails that takes the place
of his patient Griselda. The effect is just
as potent, however, and the curtain goes
down upon the prodigal spouse thrusting
$200 upon the wife, "doubling up", on
the "other man" of his dream.' It is very
well put together by Clay Clement, the
author, and capitally acted by ; Carleton
Macy and Maude Hall, the latter a one
time favorite of Morosco's.
A quaint -skit is "Dan* Cupid," with
Franz Ebert as Cupid. It is not par
ticularly .clever, but Ebert is irresistibly
comical as the Lilliputian messenger boy,
later Cupid. He is about as large as a
postage | stamp, but there is nothing; Li
lliputian about Ebert's , fun. You would
go far to find anything funnier than his
miniature "Jag," and tho oouquet that
almost knocked him downâ flung by some
Brobdignagian fist in the galleryâ fitly
expressed the sentiments of the meeting.
Elsie Ebert assists, and Eva Grau, neither
of whom have much to do, nor do It
very well.

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Grand Opera-Houae.
"Arizona" attracted the largest au
dience of the year to the Grand Opera- i
house last night. . The city's largest
theater was crowded to the utmost
limit and any number of people were
turned away. Those who' were for
tunate enough to secure seats wit
nessed a splendid performance of an
unusually fine play.
Aside from a few youngsters in
gallery, who could not refrain from
showing their disapproval of the vil
lain's machinations, the audience was
highly enthusiastic. The curtain rose
and rose again amid wild applause at
the conclusion. of the second and third
acts.
Clement Klrby makes : a remarkable
good Canby. . Clarence .Heritage was |
typically the military, martinet and
gentleman. \u25a0 Edward Farrell ; was a trifle
stagy as Denton," but" was exceedingly
popular with the audience at any rate."
Frances Desmonde, in the part of the
colonel's wife, was also well received.
Little Avis Lubdell played the part of
Bonita perfectly. Her eyes and her
smile should win her success on the
stage If; she could not act," which she
can do, and very well at that. Edward
Patterson could not have been more of
a.villian under, any circumstances. The
others of the cast kept pace with the
leaders. '
From present indications "Arizona"
will beat the .big stone building on the
corner of Fifth and Mission streets for
making money during the next week.

Miss Jessie Fillmore. and Joseph E. Pe

since Saturday night, when they quietly
slipped off to the residence â¢ of : Archblshop
Montgomery, whq read the service in
the presence of the required. witnesses.
Such a jar has not been given to the
smart set for. many a day, -as the wed
ding had been set for the 26th, and many
plans for | its celebration had been laid ;
but, alas! for well-laid plans of mice and
men! \
Miss Fillmore Is one of the handsomest
girls in the smart set, and with her beau
ty Is brainsâ rather a rare duality. She
came out about three years -ago, and
numbered among her set the most inter
esting men and girls .in -the leading dan
cing clubs,' although - she herself was not
a devotee of the dance. sÂ£r * .
Mr. Peters, the lucky 'chap';, who won
her, is" the superintendent of a large
buhach ranch near Merced, the property
of the Peters family of Stockton.
The young people registered at the Pal
ace Saturday night, and were still there
last night, but plans had been , laid for a
nuptial trip south.

cerning a widely current misapprehension rep
resenting certain views of the late Secretary
of State, Mr. Hay, the following , correspond
ence waa Kiven out to-day : -
DEPARTMENT OF STATE.
Washlnzton, D. C. Sept. 25, 1905.
Dear Mr- President: For some time past
there have appeared in various newspapers;,
including some of the journals published .in
New York, statements more or less direct to
the effect that grave differences of opinion ex
isted between yourself and tho late Secretary
of State, Mr. Hay, concerning both myself
and the. action to be taken by you on the
findings and resort of Secretary Tart: In the
matter of the charges made against me by
Mr. Bowen. a former United Btatea Minister
to Venezuela. I will cite a case in point: i â¢â¢\u25a0:â¢,
Not'long ago a responsible New York paper,
to which, I am reliably informed on ; the beet
authority, Mr. Bowen has been- freely offering
material for use, printed the following para
graphs! - " \u25a0
"Practically the la*t official act of Mr. Hay's
life was to visit the White House for the pur
pose of urging the President not to ] dismiss
Bowen and to dismiss Loomio, but learning
the President's mind was made up, he went
away with his message unspoken. Mr. Hay
thoroughly disliked and distrusted him
iLoomhs) and told the President so, but wae
unable to produce any effect on the Presi
dent* mind."
HOSTILE SUGGESTIONS.
Similar suggestions, more or less hostile in
form, have so frequently appeared In the pub
lic prints that I am constrained . to inquire
whether, in so far as you are aware, they
are supported by any basis of. truth. -
I do not know what private : conversation
may have taken place between yourself and
Mr. Hay concerning me and my. course- of con
duct while. connected with the public service,
but I do know from Mr. Hay's own lips some
thing of his opinion concerning Mr. Bowen,
and I know fully weir both t*>n unfailing cour
tesy with whlch'Mr. Hay received ray many
.suggestions concerning . departmental i matters
and the personal cordiality which he always
manifested toward me. . , \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-.â¢'. '
. In, December last I went to Mr. Hay's house
and told him that 'â¢ I expected -to realm from
the department within the v course. of the next
elKht or nine- months.: He. was good enough
to gay: "I am very sorry to hear this. I have
always hoped you would . remain in your rpres-,
ent position as long as I remained In the Cab
inet." On another occasion both before and
since that time, Mr. Hay accorded me seem
ingly convincing proof .of his confidence. '
It may Interest you to know that at Mr.
Hay'Â« request I was with him at * his home
in- what proved practically the last hour of his
life in Washington. .Having upon that occa
sion indicated to me fully and lucidly, as. was
his wont, what he , wished my two colleagues
and myself to do in the lines of departmental
action and the policy to be carried out during
his. absence, he referred to the. recent Bowen
episode with much feeling. Among other
things he said he was disgusted with Bowen
beyond expression; that vanity, appeared to
be a disease with him, and that he was both
disloyal and untruthful, and had been treach
erous not only to him (Mr. Hay), but to the
country.' . . \u25a0 : _.;-..*.;\u25a0;
â¢ In view of this conversation, to whfch I
have adverted in the I briefest possible man
ner, it- is difficult to believe that there is any
truth in either 'of the â¢ foregoing I paragraphs
which I have quoted, or any i others . which
have been printed of similar import. â¢â¢"â¢'\u25a0.
As I am very soon to retire from the vub
llc service" I "'trust, you \u25a0.\u25a0will not feel that \u25a0 I am

acter..'" :7t: 7 t: '.
At that time McCready did not- know,
that Sargent^.had escaped last night at
tian Jose from Constable J. S. Grider of
Palo Alto, who had taken the young man
in custody from San Francisco, where he
was â¢ arrested Friday for the alleged theft
of a bicycle owneii- by C A. Montgomery,
a htudeut at Stanford University.
Sargent had filed the links of Grider's
handcuffs apart by using Â«. rasp, which
vas fourui. in his coat pocket after, he
was shot. \u25a0 The locked gyres remained on
his wrists. He had stolen another bicycle
end after freeing his shackled wrists by
separating the two ' manacles, ridden to
Oakland. Â« - - ?
Even after he was , shot Sartrent made
a desperate fight and gave three police
men a handful of battle before he was
eubdued. The shooting attracted Special
Policeman Noble a.iÂ»d Patrolman Tillot
.son. ' While ft!cCr/?ady went to a signal
box to summon the police wa^on, Noble
ran into the backyard, where the -, shots;
v,ere fired, to tind the man.* He thought'
the fugitive might have been shamming
when he dropped In a heap to the ground.
Noble saw the form of the., man on the
ground and started toward him. Sar
gent gave fight and desperately ham
nered the odcer's head with,. the wrist
circled handcuffs.
'WOU.VDED SIAX SUBDUED!
McCready and Tillotson took a hand in
the encounter and subdued the desper
etely wounded man. . He was sent- to. the

- This was not the "first encounter Sar
ger.t had wlth~ the Oakland police in;hls #
efforts , "to escai>e capture. An hour.tir
to earlltr, while riding a" b:cycle without
a light, he was overhauled in. East Oak
land by Policeman .Bryne. The; patroj-i
man stopped Sargent at Twelfth street,
rear Thirteenth avenue!" While" he "was*
talking with the man a Portuguese hailed
the -policeman to find V rooming-house:
As Bryne's attention was distracted Sar
gent hurled his bicycle at him and upset
the officer, who, before hr. recovered his"
equilibrium, saw his man disappear
through an alley on. a hard run, leaving
the wheel behind.
At that time Byrne did not see the
handcuffs on Sargent's wrists, his coat
"sleeves concealing them from view.
The meeting with Bryne occurred at
2:15 o'clock. The next and final chap
ter in the flight occurred at the Roff
residence. McCready accosted ' l Sargent
while the young man -jw*s walking
along Telegraph avenu^ but was evi
.dosuly trying to avoid .being observed.
The patrolman -watched the,suspicious
looking' pedestrian for a few minutes,
then stopped him. Sargent broke Into
a run through Twenty-fourth j street,
. .not heeding McCready's- . command,
. "Halt, or 111 shoot." Twice . djd the
'. patrolman repeat the order, .without
result /Then he drew, his pistol' and
JrÂ»d two'' shots In the air. McCready
wes running fast and was closetipon
the fleeing man when he fired at - the
fugitive, just as the "latter started o,ver,
a fence. .' : . . ..

i This bullet did not hit the runaway.
Ateecond shot brought' him down. Not
sure whether the man was shamming,
McCready went to him and saw he was
. wounded. As he ran to the patrol box
Noble came on tne scene, followed by
Tillotson.
Not a word concerning: himself -did
Sargent utter. Dr. R/ -S. - Btratton
itrephined the skull, removing a piece
of bone, which was three inches long:
end an inch and a half wide. The
bullet entered at the back of the left
cide of the head and plowed through
the brain, making exit above the left
Â«ax. There Is a chance that Sargent
will live, though his condition is very
* terlous. He. lost several iablespoonfuls
of brain matter. - - â¢ " .
Sargent's identity was disclosed ~by
papers and .letters which Constable
Grider had found in his ( possession.
Some of these were letters of recom

covered. Sargent had failed to enter

gaze. Schmidt's .wife had been alarmed
several times at night recently by the
sounds of muffled footsteps on the porch
and the appearance of a race outside the
bathroom . window. She communicated
this to her husband, and last night when
the peeper came Schmidt was ready to
receive him. He quietly slipped out of
the rear door of his home. and going to
the side of the house took up a position
where he could observe the actions of
the ; inquisitive nocturnal visitor. As the
\u25a0peeper clambered to the wtndow -Schmidt
pounced upon him and pummeled him all
about the front yard. He started * the
gore from Gastlne's nose and closed both
eyes. "with stiff punches. Schmidt says
that* Gastine made a move as if to draw
a pistol. Gastine' had on a pair of soft
slippers when hÂ« encountered Â» Schmidt.
' jGastine was released by Night \u25a0 Prison
Keeper Edward Hadley on $15 cash ball
furnished by the peeper's wife.

THE FLURRY IN MONEY.
THE feature in business last. week was the sudden flurry in call,
money in New York on, Friday, the rate advancing from^^ to
7 per cent, with frequent fluctuations up and down between
these two extremes. The causes of the flurry were, several, but the
salient ones were the loss of $6,679,000 from the banks to the sub
treasury, the drafts and borrowings to provide for the quarterly set
tlements on October 1 and to carry current matters over to Monday,
the movement of the Western. crops, the Pennsylvania and Atchison
bond subscription payments and the advance in the Bank of Eng
land discount rate from 3to 4 per cent the day before. , v
.1 All these combined circumstances were sufficient to stagger
any money market, and it is not surprising that the rates advanced.
But there" was no alarm, as all these conditions had been expected,
and when 'the. rate got up to 6 per cent the banks and other large
nnancial interests promptly appeared in the market with millions
to lend, one bank.alone loaning $10,000,000 at this figure, an indi
vidual house $3,000,000, and other 'institutions very heavy, sums.
This ready appearance of available funds allayed any t apprehen
sion that might have been felt, and the market receded from 7 to 6
per cent, where it closed. There were loans on Saturday at s|an_d
'hV'z P er cent - The flurry was apparently the culmination of the dis
turbance, as the rates for call loans had been advancing for some
days. Premonitions had been given a fortnight before by the ad
vance in the rates of discounts by the banks of England, France ami
Germany, and the flurry had largely been foreseen and discounted.
A matter of extensive comment was the steadiness and even
buoyancy with which the stock market received the sudden rise in
money. By all precedent the advance in money should have caused
consequent? liquidation in the stock market and a resultant decline
in stocks, but this expected occurrence did not take place. The
whole list was steady and some stocks 'actually went up. It was
an artificial steadiness, however, and readily comprehensible by ac
customed observers of the stock market. .Strong hands were sus
taining quotations and would not permit them to fall. This showed
two conditions â first, that the public were not very large holders
of stocks, else mere would have been immediate and hysterical
liquidation; and second, that the great banking' interests were not
willing to see a lower market at this time; But^even if the-steadi-.
ness were artificial and contrary to the normal laws of trade, the
fact that the market -could be held up under such an array of ad
verse circumstances was proof that underlying supporting forces
were very strong, that basic conditions of trade were on firm founda
tions, and was therefore encouraging and productive of confidence
â¢in the future: In all respects, therefore, Friday was a very inter
esting and curious day in money and stock circles.
Reports from the industrials and staples were again cheerful.
The season is now so late that the crops may be considered sate
from frosts as a rule, and abundant harvests are thus assured. This
is a great thing for the country. Again, the mills and factories
everywhere report their machinery running topfull capacity. The
American Locomotive Company reports a. very large business
booked ahead for the coming year and that every department will
be loaded to the limit for a long period. Railway managers report
a scarcity of cars and engines to handle the business tendered them.
The bank clearings for the week were 26.1 per cent larger than for
the corresponding week last year, with almost all the leading cities
and towns showing gains, and the aggregate clearings were $2,539,7
000,000. Mercantile collections were reported good in all sections-
Cotton sales of large proportions at good prices were reported by
â¢the Sottfh, and the distribution of merchandise was liberal every
where. All kinds of building and structural material were in con
tinued active demand. Winter seeding of wheat was active, with an
increased acreage indicated. The scarcity of steel is increasing, and,
as mentioned several times of late, orders for considerably over a
million tons of steel rails have been booked for the coming year.
The only line in the country showing overproduction at present is
bituminous coal. , v
Thus, with abundant crops, selling at high prices, the mills and
'labor fuily employed, the wholesalers, jobbers and retailers report
ing activity in their several lines, collections prompt and plenty bÂ£
.money, apparently, to meet all calls, it appears that the country is
still in the full enjoyment of prosperity. Orf the. Pacific Coast* the
prospects for the coming } r ear are especially bright, there being no
adverse conditions of any consequence at present.
INSURANCE REMEDIES.
LIFE insurance methods are sharply criticized in' the October
number of the Forum by . Louis Windmuller. He does not
confine blame to officers of the companies, but shows that the
public is in large measure responsible fpr, the mismanagement of;
funds and the extravagance which has ;â¢ made insurance come-rfar
dearer to people of moderate 1 means than' they could afford.^ His.
paper points out grave faults and also suggests remedies that he
'thinks would correct them. .
- It is well known that the value of a policy becomes greatly less
ened if the holder is obliged to surrender it from inability to pay.
the premium; but it is not so well known that the profits to the
companies from this source are enormous, that a very large propor
tion of the people are caught in financial straits and are so compelled
to sacrifice a Urge part of the savings they had put into insurance.
It is easily seen that the effect of this system of compelling policy
holders to risk their premium money is to make a gamble of an
outlay that ought to be the very opposite of the gambling spirit. We
are told that twice as much insurance lapses and is surrendered as
is paid for at maturity. "Man}' forfeitures occur because sanguine
persons, persuaded by overzealous agents, are unable to pay even
the second premium." v
v One of the remedies recommended is that all the companies
could do a larger and safer business if they "were to return to the
first principles of life insurance, selling, for the smallest premiums
consistent with safety, old line, non-participating policies." As for
Jlie public's. share in the blame, the writer says : "For the extensive
sale of these expensive policies the public is largely- to blame. The
most audacious canvassers could not have. succeeded by their ,'rribst
insinuating manners in placing the large number they did if the expec
tation of the insured that during their lives they would participate in
the profits had not induced them to take them. * * * Their
credulity has created the vast power of^ the huge companies which
they now ask the Federal Government to control."

PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC EYE
M. Witte, principal Russian delegate

attention by "acts \of disobedience. He
/was" a station master in "Southern Rus
sia at the time of the "war with Tur
key^;; In that campaign Russia's posi
tion in the field .was jeopardized by the
lack of .reinforcements resulting, from
official incompetence, causing conges
tion of; the whole railway lines. M.
Witte disobeyed, the insane instructions
of his superiors, 'straightened 'things
out and rushed through trains laden
with troops, leaving on sidings special

gives the following as a method of treat

or other domestic cat out of a fit without
mutilating it In any way. give half-tea
spoonful doses of salt dissolved in tepid
water: put wet salt upon th* tongue, re
peat two or three times if necessary;
shelter the animal from cold and draft;
give a comfortable bed *ln a dark, quiet
place. If this does not bring about tha
desired result apply a flannel wrung out
in warm alcohol or whisky to tha abdo
men and cover carefully. You will prob
ably soon hear the animal purring In re
lief and a long sleep will follow. To
prevent a repetition of the fits avoid
startling or worrying the animal. Give it
a variety of simple food, no tough or
stringy or raw meat; never give the ani
mal meat wfth a milk diet or allow it to
lie with its^ead toward the flre. If the
fit is the result of a bltft or sting consult
a veterinary surgeon."

To-day the Daughters of the South, with
their bonny maids and their stalwart

the official history of the organization of

To-morrow the new home of the Cali-
Xoraia Club, the first. woman's clubhouse
in Northern California (so far as I know),
frill throw open its doors to its members.
And whatever the lukewarraness of their
attitude during "the gray days of the
horse's conception, there Is a general hal
itlujah chorus now abroad in the club at
ihe results â and the exemplification that
nothing succeeds like success.
The devotion of Mrs. Aylett R. Cotton
and Mrs. R. I. Whelan to the building of
the clubhouse (under authorization from
the board of directors) is really phenom
enal, for it was an early bird of a con
tractor who got to the building In the
mornings ahead of these women.
The fact that the architect aud the
son.tractc>r are not now candidates for
A lie foolish factory is explained in the
' tr,ove parenthetic phrase.
Since the inception cf the clubhouse,
three years ago. a building committee of
fifteen has ostensibly directed affairs;
but fancy fifteen Bremen building even a
henhouse. Each of those fifteen women
had her own well-defined, dyed and
Ktazcped opinions about how clubhouses
chould be built, and â well, if the board
fca-dn't wisely Etepped in and granted
executive power to the president of the
club and the chairman of the building
committeeâ both women of balanceâ the
clubhouse would still be a rosy vision in
the eaaethyst air.
As it is, one cf the finest clubhouses
in the country star.ds completedâ yes, and
furnished. It Is symbolic in its outward
simplicity of the club's high Ideals.
Within It is artistic utilitarian and a
Joyous reservoir of sunshine.
Thus, when the members foregather in
their pretty frocks to-morrow for mu
tual felicitations,, they will, in small
n-easure, appreciate the love-labor of the
women who crystallized dreams Into the
beautiful home.- As for Mrs. E. P. Schell,
chairman of the furnishing committee,
urJiinited credit Is due, as by clever
manipulation the furniture, was already
pecked to hustle it out to the home as
coon as the tradesmen withdrew.
Owing to a delay in the mails many
members have failed to receive their new
e*!endars containing their cards of ad
trisslon to the big- reception on Thurs-
night. Don't worry. All you need
Is to hunt up the secretary to-morrow
et the clubhouse and you will get your
card if It hasn't elready arrived, and
you may get out your jfretty ' frocks for
Thursday night without misgivings. On
that night will the women display to a
chaffing world what women can do all
fey themselvesâ although were I to take
you into my confidence, which, of course,
I wouldn't, I \u25a0 would say that masculine
advice was. sometimes sought for andâ
' followed. VwSSS
On- this point Judge Aylett R. Cotton
Â«nd E. P. Scheel and Richard L Whelan
might throw some light.

and by Mrs. J. W. Orr. whose wit and

of the <cleveresi things to Mrs. Orr*s
credit in the club were impromptu.
Besides the discussions. Miss Ruth Al
len and Beatrice Bromtteld of the Alcazar
company will give selected readings.
For such a programme, rich in original
lines, it should draw heavily. And all the
club members are welcome.

much clever work is looked for from it
during the year.

! An illustrated lecture upon the historic

etc, the details of which are not fully
developed.
Tickets (50 cents) are already on sale,

On Thursday. September 28, the Corona

Special Dispatch' to The Call.
VICTpRIA. B. C, Oct.l.â The Govern
ment: of Canada proposes to inaugurate a
system of free ports" on both the Atlantic
and Pacific' seaboards",*-- the ..latter em
bracing Victoria and .Vancouver. g This
will relieve shipping entering and clearing
from here from all charges : to ;.; which at
is now subjected. The plan is for the
Government to take over;tne harbor and
its i management and - hire what â¢ officers,
in the persons of pilots, snipping masters
and'wharfers, may be necessary, "those
men to be paid by the Government and
not" directly by the shipping ' using the
ports.
Vessels would then be "relieved of all
charges excepting a trifling fee." In short,
the harbors would be administered as the
canal system of the East is, ; the lock
tenders being paid by .the .Government,
and the boats passing through being re
quired to (pay only a nominal fee for
using these artificial waterways.

BOYS HOLD UP
MISSION SALOON
\u2666
Boldly Enter Place of A. P.
Ness Jit Midnight and
Loot the Cash Register
MAKE OFF WITH $20
.Keep Proprietor at Point of
Revolver Until Frightened
Away by Wife's Whistle
Two boys, both under the age of 20
years, entered the saloon of A. P. Ness,
1111 Mission street, at midnight last night
and while one of them held back the
proprietor at the point of a revolver
the other rifled the cash drawer of about
520. The wife of Ness was seated In the
back room and as soon as she recovered
from her first fright she blew a police
whistle.
The noise disturbed the boys and they
fled into the street, dropping some of
the money on the floor. Two other boys,
Alfred Navarttte of Â«.i Natoma street
and James Weber of 94S>Â£ Mission street,
who were passing at the time, gave chase
to the robbers. The fugitives turned from
Mission street up Eighth to Market and
there hid themselves in the crowd.
Immediately after the robbery, Police
man Patrick Sullivan arrived on the
scene. Ness says that he was too sur
prised to have a chance to resist. The
boys wore no masks, but entered the
saloon and ordered beer. As Nessi turned
to draw the liquor, one of them com
manded him to throw up his hands. He
describes them as young, one tall and
slim and the other broader and heavier.
Both wore soft hats. Ness says that he
never saw them before.
Detective Sllvey has been detailed" on
the case. The police believe that they
know the boys and that they have been
implicated in a number of recent Mission
hold-ups. They expect to' make the ar
rests to-day.
Han Curious Adventure.
Jolin Malloy, a lumber man, Mrho re
cently arrived from Fort Braerg, en
joyed the novel experience of awaken
ing in a dark wine cellar early yester
day morning and of being released at
the point of a gun from an adjoining
jewelry store on Battery street. Malloy
came to San Francisco only a few days
ago. Saturday night he crawled Into
the wine cellar of Rusconl, Fisher &
Co.'s liquor store at 307 Battery street.
He went to sleep there :|nd on awaken
ing at 3 o'clock In .the morning he
groped his way through a staircase
leading to J. C. Pascoe's jewerly store.
There a passing newsboy saw him and
the police were quickly on the scene.
He has now left for his home at Fort
Bragg. - Â£--
SWEDISH ELECTIONS
ARE CONCLUDED
STOCKHOLM, Oct. I.â Elections for the
members for the second chamber of the
Riksdag, which were held during Sep
tember, have just been concluded. The
\u25a0question of the dissolution of the union
of Norway and Sweden/ exercised little
influence during the campaign, the pre
dominant factors being the extension 'of
the franchise and the adoption of pro
portional representation.
The result shows a decided majority
against the latter issue, indicating that
there will be another deadlock in the
Riksdag, as the first chamber stands
committed to the proportional system.
The members of the left have a small
majority in the new chamber. The So
cialists hold fourteen seats, having gained
several. '

The Toyo Kisen Kalsha Bteamsbips
have once moie entered the service be
tween this port and Japan. The America
Maru sailed yesterday from Yokohama
for this port, and will be due to arrive
here on the 17th. .
It Is eighteen months since this line of
steamships ceased business across the
Pacific. In the meantime they, have been
acting as war transports for the Japanese
Government. They were all changed and
altered to suit the requirements of that
service. The America Maru, however,
was less changed than any of the others,
so 'she is the first one to be put into
commission. The other two .belonging to
the fleet are the Nippon Maru and the
Hongkong Maru. These are now under
going extensive repairs and will go into
commission, as soon as they are In shape.'
The boats of the company will run con
jointly with the boats of the Pacific Mall
Steamship Company and the Occidental
and Oriental Steamship Company.
Goes on Trlnl Trip.
The transport Thomas went out for her trial
trip yesterday. A thorough test ; waÂ» made
of her engines, while her, compasses were ad-
Justed, and are now 'in perfect working order.'
Captain Hart, who has had . charge of ' the
changes and improvements >to the transport,
was highly pleased with the trip. He said
that everything worked to perfection. The
steamer is In command of Captain ; Lyman.:
She left the transport dock at noon and
steamed down the water front | and out near
the r>olnt where the Alameda' lies on -ther'
rocks. She then turned about and came back
down the bay as far as Alcatraz, when she
took a tack north and ran through | Raccoon
Straits, then up as far as California City,
when she made a. turn and came back to the
dock. On board were a few friends . of Cap
tain Hart and Captain Lyman. The Thomas
sails for the Philippines on Thursday. â¢
Homeward Bound Starts North.
The American bark Homeward Bound, Cap
tain Thompson, passed out over the bar yes
terday in tow of the tug Sea Rover. The

RECORDS SHOW
TRADE INCREASE
Department of Labor's Quar
terly Bulletin Points to
the Improved Prosperity
UNIONS ARE STRONGER
Percentage of Unemployed
Members Is Less by Half
This Year Than in 1904
ALBANY, N. V., Oct. I.â ln its last
quarterly bulletin, published to-day, the
State. Department of Labor calls atten
tion ; to a; marked improvement In trade,
which y^began in \ the middle of 1904 and
has continued uninterruptedly. The de
partment says that now there are rela
tively fewer idle wage-earners In New
York than there were. even in 1902, the
most prosperous year of ' the decade.
.--'Returns to the Bureau of Labor Statis
tics from unions embracing a
membership of . about 100,000 ' wage-earn
ers in the various occupations show that
the average monthly number of unem
ployed members was only 151 per 1000
In the first half of 1905, as .compared with
202 last year and 168 In 1902.
.In building and construction, which
probably employs more men at .present
than any other New York industry, the
volume of production has been unusually
large. Â»
In the months qf April, May and June
work was begun on 7316 buildings In New
York City, as compared with 6164 a year
ago. The estimated cost of projected
buildings for which plans were approved
and permits issued in the second quarter
of 1905 attained the amazing sum of
178,417,896. â In the other large cities
building operations are well above the
average.

splendid game at left wing. Robinson,

Mrs. Johnson was Hester Larsen at the

He started to find "work In "Wyoming,
and Mrs. Johnson, with her hair cut short
and wearing a suit of his clothes, went
with him. The two were playing in a
card game at Evanston, Wyo., when
Johnson forged a check. For this ho has
Just been sentenced to serve six years in
the Wyoming prison. Mrs. .Johnson has
returned to her home In Salt Lake, but
declares she will yet save Johnson from
his own weakness. .

their rides on brakebeams of freight
trains and of the "hoboing lt" on foot to
gether, of their experiences when both
worked as sheep herders and of adven
tures In saloons and gambling-houses,
where none suspected the sex of "John

Whitney Stable Entry
: Looks Like a Certainty for
Colt Part of Matron Stakes
Special XUspatch to Tht , Call.
â¢ XEW YORK. Oct. I.â With the opening j
at Betaor.t Park to-morrow afternoon
last of the big race meetings of the ]
yÂ«?ar will be ushered in. The fields are |
not likely to be as cumbersome as of
â¢ late, and there will more class to them.
The smaller fry are resting up for the
f.r.a.l attractions of the waning season
at Jamaica. Aqueduct and Bennlnirs. The
two sections of the Matron stakes are
the features to-morrow, with the Jerome
handicap thrown in for good measure. In i
the last race of the day a field of handi
cap horses is entered under- favorable
conditions for some of them. . â¢
The Whitney entry-. Burgomaster, looks
a certainty for the colt part of the' Ma
tron stakes. The rilly part of wie Matron
Is likely to furnish a more interesting
\u2666â¢or.test. as there are really no stars en
gaged in it, and the few named to start
\u25a0 ::guru closely together. It is a toss-up
between Perverse ar.d Deviltree on past

of Strecker and Bendel
Adolph Strecker is again king of the
riflemen of California. For three years
in succession this world-renowned marks
man has defended the kingly title against
all opponents. To become king In the
I contests of the California Schuetzen Club
I requires the utmost skill, as the contest
Is open, to all who wish to enter. Each
competitor was required to fire 200 shots
yesterday, and many of the best marks-
I men in the State contested for the" high
\ honor. '"'â¢. i ,'!
J King Strecker made 374 points In his
j record, being almost two points for each
I ehot. His nearest competitor was A. C
; Gehret, who made 333 points, followed
j by F. P. Schuster, with 331, and L. Ben
del, with 326- In the contest for most
points Strecker was also in the lead,
with 459, with Gehret second.
The visiting marksmen from Denver,
Sacramento, Palo Alto, Petaluma and
San Jose were well pleased with the ar
rangements made for their reception, and
particularly enjoyed the speech of Presi
dent Philo Jacoby in the banquet hall,
when he recited the history oi rifle shoot
ing in California, from the time the sig

Game Greyhounds Defeat
Their Opponents in the
Three Events.
The coursing at Inglesice yesterday
was notable for the number of excep
tionally severe trials. In many of thq
courses it was necessary to slip six re
lief dogs before the fleet-footed hares
were run down. As a result, outsiders,
which did not figure, captured the long
end of the purse. lit the champion event
Conroy won by default, as his opponent
was withdrawn in the final on account,
of severe running. Royal Friend .out
stayed the bunch in the reserve -event
and won the purse purely on staying
qualities. Crazy Jane also showed her
merit on long hares, and defeated Miss
Buneretiros in the last course of the

If Umpire} Slats. Davis had been look-,
ing at second base, out at ' Recreation
Park yesterday afternoon . instead of of'
flcins around the 'field and trying . to
hurry the game along, the Angels might
possibly have beaten the Seals, to the
finish. At ajl events, they would have
tied up the score and another few rounds
would have been necessary to settle- the
outcome.
Davis broke his record for infallibility
in the eighth spasm, .when the Seals were
pulling off a batting bee that was like
unto one of those in the * olden times.
Three runs had scored and Charley Ir
win was on first, with: Shea at the bat
and one in the cellar. Shea, struck out
and Heine Spies winged the ball to sec
ond, 'cutting off Irwin ' by ' many " feet. \u25a0"
Mr. Davis was consulting his watch and
looking to make a record instead of
watching. the play. . He thought two were
out and therefore . Irwin had to be safe.
He came home a moment later on an er
ror by Brashear, thus terminating one
of the funniest blunders of which an um
pire was ever guilty In this league. ,';
Leaving aside the rough work of Davis,
the game was a. wonder, and the finish
happened like a dream of ancient times.
It was even up with two all In the fifth,
when Mohler, walked. Hllde sacriflcedj
and Joe Nealon tore through with his
second double against; the left field fence,
chasing JMohler in ahead of him. Along
came Householder with one just like Nea
lon's, only against the right field fence.
The fans nearly threw fits when Irwin
wallopetd one - at Flood that was so hot
it bounded out to right field, letting in
Householder. Shea . fanned . and Davis*
mistake let Irwin steal second. He scored
soon after, when Brashear booted Goch
nauer's grounder.
Everyone in the lot heaved a sigh of
relief, never dreaming that the Angels
v/ere about -to put a few over, j Cravath,
the first man up, > got .the only, pass Hitt
issued and Ross" tore "oft- a' Dingier. â¢ Old
Heine Spies was right there with a double
to the right garden, sending . Cravath over
the Jumps. Charley Baurri showed he
was still, in the game when he rapped a
pretty one between right and center
fields, sending Ross and Spies tearing in.
ahead of. him. There were two chances
left, but neither Bernard nor Flood could
make good, so the glory went to the
Seals by a hair-line verdict. The score:

Gate Park courts. The preliminary and
first rounds were completed ,and two
matches in the second round were played.
In the doubles one preliminary and 039
first round match were played. The de
feat of Percy Murdock und Clarence
Griffin came as a great surprise. The/
met Carl Gardner and Charles Dunlap
and were beaten two sets out of three.
Many thought the losers were- about tHe
strongest team in the doubles event, but
they were outplayed by Gardner ancf
Dunlap. Neither ilurdock nor Griffra.
played his best game, while Gardner and
J Dunlap were In great fcrra.
The othÂ«r match in doubles resulted in
an easy victory for Fred Adams and
George Janes over N. Ambrose and M.
Hotchkis3.
i The . openings rounds of the singled
event brought together some of tbo.best
players entered, and several of the .
matches were unusually interesting. The
only surprise of the day in singles wad
the defeat of Fred Adams at the hanilJ
of R. N. Whitney. When they met last
Adams beat Whitney easily, and the vic
tory of the latter In straight sets yester-*
day was unlooked for. Both sets were
close, but Adams was not quite clever i
enough to win either. . â¢ ,
The match, between George Janes and
Herbert. Schmidt was one of the best of
the day. Schmidt's victory over Gardner
after the latter had disposed of Janes last
: Sunday caused many to believe he would
take Janes into camp. The coast cham
pion was at his best, and although he
lost a set to Schmidt he won quite hand

Ihe closest match was played by H.
Miller and H. Vensano. Both are lower
class men. but they furnished a close and
interesting match. The first set went to â¢
14-12 and was won by Miller. Vensano
won the second set, but his opponent
took the third easily.
â¢ Janes beat Dunlap in the first round in
straight sets. His victory over Schmidt
gives him a place in the third round.
Foley is the only other player who. lias
reached this round. - He received a default
from Getz in the first round and beac
Gayness easily in the second round.
Griffin. Murdock. Gardner. Foley and
the Baker brothers all had easy matches
and won without trouble. Herbert Lons
won two matches, but only one was actu
ally played, and in It he was almost beat
en by a new player. J. Kahn was Long's
opponent and caused quite a surprise by
winning the first net from the California
Club man. Long pulled himself together
and won the second and third sets, but it
was no walkover. \u0084

BOGUE BUYING
TERMINAL LAND
Chief Engineer \u25a0\u25a0 Virgil Bogus of the
Western Pacific Company Is having the
surveys of *the several secrlons of land
recently acquired In this city for . the
freight depot and other terminal facili
ties of the new road connected - up, and
It Is expected that ' the officials of the
company will ' soon be able \u25a0 to formally
announce Just what property it has se
cjured in San. Francisco. Through two
real estate firms the Western Pacific
has obtained an option on two blocks,
bounded by Bryant. Ninth, Division and
Eighth streets, and it is generally un
derstood that the company will use this
property as a site for its freight depots.
From that point the Western Pacific
Company's tracks will extend across the
Southern Pacific company's tracks at
Ninth and Division streets to , Sixteenth
and Kansas streets, and from .there in. a
souttaeastNdy direction to Eighteenth and
Carolina streets, thence through a tunnel
to Islais Creek, " where - tne company is
already In possession of 130 acres of land,
purchased some time ago from George L.
Center. J
It is expected ' that .the company will
find a way to . ,the \ water front along
Islais Creek.- There* isÂ«mucn speculation
as to where the Gould people will find
a suitable location on the "Day shore. Its
officials have considered a proposition to
Join with the Santa - Fe. Company at
China Basin, and it is also j known that
Engineer Bogue and other representaUves
aÂ£ the Western Pacific have been fre
quently looking over, the adjacent section,
commonly known. as Central Basin. The
selection of a water connection for the
local yards of the new -road. Is a matter
that has been causing much serious
thinking .â¢â¢airiong-.tbe -officials, of the Toad,
who are not willing .to admit that they
have "definitely settled 1 on ; any particular
point along. the bay. :
Before they .can ask the State for. a
portion of the water frdnt it will, under
the - law, be necessary , for the company
to complete fifty miles of. road .Inside 'ot
the State. Toward this end the officials
are eager that certain portions of the
overland route, particularly in the Feath
er River Canyon and between Stockton
and Kiles. shall: be built as soon as pos
sible, and it is said that the contractors
have been asked to hurry. "

/f. The .beautiful little Catholic church on
Ithie corner of ; avenue and I
street' was dedicated" to , St. Anne with
very Impressive " ceremonies yester
day., morning.' A Archbishop Montgom
ery; conducted . the '\u25a0- ceremonies, -which
were f ollpwed by high mass and . benedic
tion; .Special 7 music was furnished by a
choir org'anized"for v the'occaslon, most of
the members of which belong to the choir
of Sti Mary's: Church, Dupont and Cali
fornia streets. * . : . . '
v The services were opened by tl|e bless
ing -of the church by Archbishop -Mont
gomery, who, after sprinkling the altar
with holy water, proceeded down the aisle
and ' blessed the walls ; of \ the church.
After the blessing of the altar, and while
the archbishop was still in the body of the
church/ the candles were lighted and high
mass, sang ; by the ' pastor.i Rev. Father J.
J.: McCue.T folio wed \u25a0 immediately . aften v
'; The Very. ' Rev^- Father" Prendergast
preached '. the ; . sermon \u25a0 and made many,
references to \u25a0;', the beautiful- structure
and ;,' to the \u25a0" saint rln whose . honor it
had been, built. He sai<2 he believed
that in, a short while that part ~; of
the city' would be built up with . many
Catholic homes, much of which would be
due to the new structure Just dedicated.
; The ceremonies were ended by benedic
tion of | the blessed \ sacrament, - during
â¢which services special music was ren
dered 'by '\u25a0\u25a0 the choir.
The new Church of St. Anne is the only
structure on the' Pacific Coast; dedicated
to : the \u25a0 memory of ; that saint, and is ' al
most \u25a0 an ' exact likeness of the large and
beautiful Church of St. Anne de Beaupret
in theVcity of . Quebec.; It has been re
marked that -should . .one stand a' few
blocks ' away ; with the picture of the
Church'of St/ Anne de Beaupret one would
hardly be ' able : to â¢ tell 'the - two structures
apart. ;, The altar was patterned "after the
famous marble altar \u25a0in \u25a0; the : Charity Ba
zaar : Chapel in? the city of Paris; which
the pastor. Father McCue, . had .the honor
of visiting ; a-- few ; months ; ago. :He was
successful in. building out of wood and on
a' much .\ smaller,"! plan' an [almost exact
likeness'of that -marble altar.
