ican nan, a daugnter of Thomaa j
Leader Harman of New Orleans, it
was eminently appropriate that his son
should follow his example. But the
marriage was not lacking In. romantic

Herbert Eaton, they were packed off to

Tommies found Bermuda a dull place
and speedily repented of their insubor

But the officers discovered that
the place was not without its compen
sations in the winter season when
Americans flock to it to escape the rig
ors of a Northern climate. It was
there the future Lord Cheylesmore
â vooed and won his beautiful wife.
Thus it came about that what his

HANDSOME COUPLE.
Lord Cheylesmore is a fine figure of
a man that well accords with his mili
tary carriage. His features are of the
most approved martial type, too, and
I Wi wife are regarded as the
handsomest couple In London society.
He is a keen sportsman and an excel

world. They date from the earliest
known examples, those struck off by
Queen Bess to commemorate the defeat
of the Spanish Armada, down to the
present time. Among ether treasures,
they contain no temts than nine ex- j
arnples of the Victoria Cross.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26. â An un
known enemy, whose motive Is as
mysterious as his Identity, has made
four deliberate attempts to murder the
members of the family of J. H. F. Jar
chow, aged 80. who resides in the mis
sion town of San Gabriel, twelve miles
east of Los Angeles. Twice within the
last week large stones have been
thrown through the windows intÂ« the
room in which Jarchow and his aged
wife were resting. One of these stones
shattered the back of a chair in which
Jarchow was sitting.
Thursday night the unknown mis
creant killed a dog, which the family
had purchased to protect the place,
and threw its body into the front hall
way of the house. An hour later a
shot was heard outside and a bullet
crashed through a window of a room
which did not happen to be occupied,
but in which a light was burning.
Last night the most serious assault
was committed. After Jarchow and
his wife had retired there was a fusil
lade of shots outside the house and
several bullets entered their bedroom,
two of them knocking plaster upon the
bed of the aged couple.
A Chinese who works there happened
to be approaching the place at the
time and saw a Mexican step out of a
hedge and begin shooting at the house.
Before assistance could be summoned
the Mexican had disappeared. The
matter was reported to the Sheriff and
to-night a Deputy SherifT, armed with
a sawed-ofT shotgun, is guarding the
Jarchow residence. His presence there
is not known, even to Jarchow. His
orders are to kill any man whom he
sees shoot at the house.

SWEDEN'S
MINISTER
AS CUPID
Will Issue Marriage
Permits to His
Countrymen.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26. â Notice has
been sent to the Swedish legation in
Washington that hereafter all Swedes
who marry in any foreign country
must get permission from their dip
lomatic representative If they wish
their marriage to be legally recognized
in Sweden.
This action is due to the fact that
many Swedes have been moving to
nearby countries, where it was easy
to get divorces, and marrying again,
sometimes under conditions that
would not be allowed in Sweden.
When a Swede living in the United
States wishes to be married and re
turn to his native land he must apply
for permission to the Minister in
Washington, who, if everything is in
accordance with the laws of Sweden,
will Issue a certificate to that effect.
This certificate must be produced
when the couple return to Sweden.
In addition the Minister, when ap
plied to, must publish a notice of the
application, with the names of both
parties, In a paper in the city in which
the legation Is located and in another
in the city" in which the contracting
parties live three weeks in advance of
the ceremony. This is similar to the
bans published in Sweden for three
successive Sundays in advance of any
marriage.
Because of the great number of
Swedes in New York the Consul there
has also been given the right to issue
permits, but he is the only person
aside from the Minister who has that
power In the United States.

BIG DOCKS
DESTROYED
BY FLAMES
Loss by Fire in New
Orleans Totals
Millions.
Vast Freight Terminals ol
the Illinois Central
Burned.
Serious Blow to the Export Trade of
the Important Southern
Shipping Port.
NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 26.â A con
flagration involving millions of dollars'
loss in property and one that strikes a
serious, though temporary, blow at the
export trade of New Orleans, swept the
river front to-night and destroyed the
vast freight terminals of the Illinois
Central, known as the Stuyvesant
docks. Nearly a dozen squares of mod
ern wharves and freight sheds, two
magnificent grain elevators, hundreds
of laden cars and vast quantities of
freight, including 20,000 bales of cotton,
were destroyed, together with a large
number of small residences.
The fire was still raging fiercely at
midnight, at which time it had almost
reached the upper end or the Illinois
Central property. It has not been de
termined whether there has been any
loss of life. The ocean-going shipping
seems to have escaped serious dam
age. A number of firemen and em
ployes of the docks were injured.
Actual estimates of the losses are im
possible to obtain to-night, though they
may exceed $5,000,000.
The Stuyvesant docks extend from
Louisiana avenue, almost to Napoleon
avenue, a distance of twelve squares.
The wharves between these two points
were covered by miles of trackage and
steel and iron sheds ran the entire
GREAT ELEVATORS RAZED.
The two grain elevators were of the
most modern construction, the upper
one having a capacity of 1,000,000
bushels. Thousands of bales of cotton,
several hundred thousand packages of
sugar, great quantities of cotton seed
and oil cake, lumber and every conceiv
able variety of freight filled the ware
houses and sheds. Practically all the
export business handled by the Illinois
Central was put aboard ships at these
docks. The docks and improvements
have been under construction for ten
years past, elaborate extensions and
immense investments having been
made after the constitutional conven
tion of 1898 made it possible for the
road to invest permanently at this
point.
The fire was discovered shortly after
7 o'clock. It was said to have re
sulted from a journal that had not
been sufficiently piled. The whole
plant was equipped with gigantic wa
ter tanks and fire extinguishing ap
paratus, but the blaze, small at the
beginning, almost instantaneously got
beyond control, communicating
through the conveyors to the lower
elevator and some of the sheds. The
response of the Fire Department was
prompt, but, owing to the fact that
the terminals were not readily acces
sible because of fences and tracks,
the engines found difficulty in reach
ing the flames. In a half hour the
flre covered two squares, the lower
elevator was practically consumed and
the flames were sweeping irressistibly
both up and down the river.
VESSELS TOWED TO SAFETY.
As Boon as it became known that
the zone of the fire was the Stuyvesant
docks, harbor tugs hastened to the
wharves and vessels that were moored
there were pulled out into the river.
At the same time switch engines were
rushed to the wharves and hundreds
of boxcars laden with freight were
drawn to points above the upper end
of the terminals before the flames
reached them. Hundreds of others,
however, were consumed.
The wind was blowing down the
river when the blaze began, and the
fire spread with greater speed in that
direction. By 9 o'clock the lower ele
vator and sheds and wharves from
Amelia street to Louisiana avenue, a
distance of six squares, had fallen in.
Fortunately, Louisiana avenue is a
very broad thoroughfare and the fur
ther spread of the fire beyond that
point into a residence section was
checked. Between the points named,
however, the flames swept to com
plete destruction many cottages of
the poorer classes, the occupants in
a great many instances losing all they
possessed.
WIND AIDS THE FLAMES.
The river boats, the employes of the
road and the Fire Department con
centrated all their energies in an ef
fort to save the upper elevator be
tween Australitz and Constantinople
streets and to check the flre at that
point. The fire, however, gradually
worked past the point occupied 4jy
the elevator. Heroically the forces
kept at work, but ultimately they
were beaten and the big steel struc
ture, covered with corrugated iron,
suddenly burst Into flames at 10:30
o'clock, and in half an hour was a
complete wreck.
At midnight more than nine squares
at the terminals had been completely
destroyed and it seemed unlikely the
flre would be checked until it had
reached Napoleon avenue, which also
is a very broad street.
During the fire a heavy wind blew
and the blaze was of indescribable
fury, carrying brands to great dis
tances and driving back the crowd of
sightseers. Immense pieces of cor
rugated iron, torn from the sides of
the upper elevator, were carried
through the air as if they were feath
ers and dropped in every direction,
constantly endangering the lives of
the firemen and spectators.

WHICH WAS DENIED TO SON
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG, Feb. 26. â The mar
riage of Alan Wood of New York to
Goldie Mohr, an actress, has attracted
considerable attention here because of
the position occupied by the Wood
family in this city. It has been re
called also that Wood four years ago
forbade his son, Walter Dewees Wood
Jr., marrying an actress whom he
loved and to whom he had become
engaged without his father's knowl
edge.
The elder Wood was then engaged
with his two brothers in managing the
W. Dewees Wood Steel Mill in Mc-
Keesport. It had been handed down
to them by their father, who invented
the process for making planished iron
and steel. The sons sold the plant to
the United States Steel corporation for
the largest sum paid for any sheet
mill in the combine.
Wood selected a companion in Mc-
Keesport for his son and sent the two
boys to Europe. He gave them all
the money needed to remain away

or a million dollars, the property of
Mrs. Chadwick, has been located in a
safe deposit vault in New York and It
will be examined within a few days by
United States customs officials to as
certain whether any of It has been
smuggled. The incident may supply a
clew for the eventual unraveling of the
mystery of Mrs. Chadwick's anteced
ents and cause a sensational climax.
J. W. Friend, the Pittsburg million
aire, told the secretary he had lent Mrs.
Chadwick money on jewelry and pro
duced a note for $74,000. He said he
had been given this jewelry as col
lateral. He had the jewelry in Pitts
burg for a long time, but when the ex

was first made he took it to New York
and left it with a safe deposit company
in Broadway.
Friend expressed the belief that the
note he held from Mrs. Chadwick would
be paid. He said that he had not the
slightest doubt that all of her money

seemed to base his belief on what he
professed to know of her antecedents

CHICAGO, Feb. 26.â There is a scarc

only once in the history of Chicago
have grocers asked more for their but

of good creamery quality brought from
37 to 40 cents a pound in grocery stores.
This was not of the best quality, for
the grocers felt no hesistancy in de
manding from 40 to 45 cents a pound
for that.
That there is famine ahead is fore
told by the condition of the cold stor

stored. Ordinarily there are hundreds
of thousands pt pounds stored in them
at this season of year. There Is not

Keesporter not to permit his son to re
turn home until he had forgotten the
girl he would marry. Walter Wood,
the son, is now in Santa Barbara, Cal.,
with his uncle, Thomas Dewees Wood.
The action of the father in marry
ing an actress in New York is looked
upon by the Wood family and society
as a fateful occurrence. Wood had
been married twice previous to his
New York marriage. His first wife
was Miss Nannie Knox, a sister of
Senator P. C. Knox. His second wife
was Miss Alberta Carrier.
The Wood family lived in a beauti
ful mansion on Moorewood avenue,
which was sold after the second Mrs.
Wood died. Wood then moved to New
York and built a home on the River
side drive. This he is said to have
given up about a year ago because of
his infatuation for Miss Mohr and be
cause of the objection his children
made to his love affair.
Wood is about 60 years old. He is
related by marriage to A. Hart Mc-
Kee, who married Mrs. Hugh Tevis
recently, and to other Pittsburg mil
lionaires.
last summer. The Austrian fell in love
with the pretty American girl, and be
fore the summer was over they were
engaged. Miss Jones' mother returned
to America, but Miss Jones remained
to study music. She is a fine violinist.
and has been one of the players in the
girls' orchestra, which has enlivened
Vincent Club festivals and fairs.
Finally the date of the wedding was
announced and the invitations issued.
Miss Jones came to this country on a
steamship with her fiance and arrived
in Boston last Tuesday. Up to then
she had seemed satisfied with her
choice and happy over the prospect oi
her marriase. Two days* later sh4
wrote to the Baron:
"I have engaged myself to marry
you, and if you insist on it I shall do
so. But Ido not wish it any longer."
sThe Austrian officer released Miss
Jones from her engagement at once.
He was badly broken up over the turn

be learned positively.
Chancellor Samuel B. McCormick of

that architects will be started at work

as the site has been decided upon.
It is believed that the Schenley

will be made part of the university.
With the Carnegie Institute, the insti

CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Feb. 26.â With I
dent Roosevelt and the Republican
warhorses in Congress pulling in dif
ferent directions the inauguration will
lack the essentials of a party love
feast. It is not exaggerating the sit
uation here to say that the President,
on the eve of his inauguration and
less than four months after pulling an
unprecedented plurality, rincid his lead/
eiship disputed and the whole ques
tion of origination and executio:
policies to be fought out during th*
next four years.
"What is regarded as a very. signifi

about the President, and it has cre
ated a painful impression among mem
bers of Congress Who have grown to
regard the party as 'the controlling
force in national . affairs. The Presi

which Senator Cockrell of Missouri was
present. Mr. Roosevelt arose and an
nounced that he was going .to do an

were taken a3 a sort of declaration of
independence of the Republican party
and have been the subject of much
comment by Senators.
The event 3of the last two weeks
show that the Senate and House are
both accepting the challenge of the
President and party lines are being
drawn against him. It is regarded as
inevitable that the next Congress will
witness a struggle between the Presi
dent and Congress in which he may
be beaten if the Democrats do not come
to his assistance.
Men who have sat in Congress and
followed the course of national politics
for the last twenty-five year 3 say the
drift which has set in means that the
next Congress will witness the rapid
progress of one of the greatest con
tests between a President and the Sen
ate and House that has occurred In
several decades. It will be over two
great questions! â the control of trans
portation and the exercise of power
by the President. They expect It to
involve the selection of Presidential
candidates in 1908. Some men in the
Republican party even now are seri

"conservative" wing of the Republican

JAPANESE ARE ATTACKING
KUROPATKIN'S LEFT FLANK
Russians Now Being Driven
From Their Positions.
LOSSES ARE BELIEVED TO BE HEAVY
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 27.â An ac
tion of no mean proportions is in pro
gress on the Russian left flank. The
advantage thus far is on the Bide of the
Japanese, though at heavy cost.
From advices from the front it is
difficult to say how severe the losses
have been or how decisive the reverse,
end whether the Japanese are likely to
attempt to drive in the Russian left
much farther. General Kuropatkin
evidently has been trying to establish
his left flank far in advance, to com
mand the crossings of the Taitse River.
the operation being a counterpart of
General Gripenberg's movement on the
light flank to secure the fords of the
Hun River preparatory to the breaking
up of the ice in the spring.
The scene of the operations is fifty
miles southeast of Mukden, beyond
J3a Pass, an Important defile command
ing the road to Fushun. Both armies
â occupying apparently impregnable po
fcitions on the center, General Kuropat
kin evidently planned to inaugurate
â¢widely sweeping operations on both
flanks,' but the Japanese countered
hard..
Press dispatches from the front in
dicate that the weather is fine and fa
vorable for operations and that all is
Quiet'on the Russian right wing.
General Kuropatkin telegraphed to
the Emperor, under date of February
25. as follows:
"At 5 o'clock this morning the
enemy occupied Tsinkhetchen. Exact
reports of our losses yesterday have
not* yet been received. There are
twelve officers and about 300 men
wounded In the hospitals at San Lun
yu. The percentage of killed is very
large. The commander of the detach
ment reports acts of bravery by many
I detached bodies of troops." >-
General Kuropatkin instances many
cases of close fighting and bayonet
charges and concludes:
â  "This morning a battalion, of the
enemy advanced in the direction of
Pap'in. Pass, six miles southwest of San
'Lunyu, and this evening the enemy's
outposts commenced to approach the
passes occupied by us."
, MUKDEN. Feb. 26. Fighting con
tinues in front of and west of Tie
Pass. On the extreme east the Jap
anese have taken the outlying posi
tions and they now threaten the main
defenses. Owing to their formidable
attack it is believed that the Japanese
artillerymen are veterans from Port
Arthur, commanded by General Nogi.
Forty wounded Russians arrived at
Mukden to-day and 400 are expected
to-morrow. Other indications point
to an unusual struggle.
A blustering snowstorm all day is
ending in a bitter wind which may
modify the threatened conflict. The
region of the Japanese attack is In
lightly wooded and high mountains,
favorable to the Russian operation. A
force ;." of - Japanese of unkonwn
strength, joined with Chinese brigands
west of Kungchialin, is still menacing j
the Russians in that region.
The cannonade along the Russian
center diminished in intensity to-day.
There Is no evidence of activity on the
part of the Japanese, who are strong

the railway* under martial law with a
view of expediting the transportation
of troops to the Far East.
The correspondent adds that the
South Russia Rifle Brigade, which lei't

She -has extensively equipped yards,
shops, gun and armor foundries. There
is a strong feeling and growing senti

naval yards are already engaged upon

LITTLE HOPE
FOR BOODLERS
Special Disuatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 26. â To-mor
row morning at 11 o'clock, unless
fourteen members of the Upper House
of the Legislature brave enough to
face the wrath of their constituents
can be found, Senators Emmons,
French, Bunkers and Wright will be
expelled from the Senate. The most
ardent supporters of the accused can
not count more than five votes in their
favor, outside, of course, of the three
votes the members of the quar
tette can cast. It is announced to
nigrht that Emmons has safely passed
through the crisis of his illness and
that no further delay is necessary out
of sympathy for him.
One of the members of the special
investigating committee said to-night
that the matter would not again go
over, but that to-morrow noon would
see the names of all the accused strick
en from the roll. There was some
discussion to-night as to the method
that will be pursued by the Senate to
purge itself of its disgraced members.
It is admitted that the mere adoption
of the report of the investigating com
mittee, which recommended that the
a< <us*:d bo expelled, would not be suf-
DcienL As a result four resolutions,
each containing the name of on^ of
the boodlers, were drawn up and on
these the vote will be taken.
These resolutions are to the effect
that the men found guilty of bribery
be expelled from the Senate, and that
the Sergeant-at-Arms deprive them of
their keys and prevent them occupy
ing their seats during the rest of the
session. It is not known whether
Bunkers, French and Wright will be
present to speak In their own behalf
to-morrow. If they demand this right
a dramatic scene is sure to mark the
close of the great scandal.

His wound is healing. He is still sub

IN EXPLOSION
BLUEFIELD, W. Va.. Feb. 26.â As
the result of an explosion in shaft No.
1 of the United States Coal and Coke
Company at Wilcoxe to-day, twenty
three miners are supposed to have lost
their lives and it is possible that the
number will exceed this. Up to 8
o'clock to-night fifteen dead bodies
had been taken from the shaft. A larce
rescuing party is in the mines to-nleht.
It Is barely possible, but not likely,
that some of the remaining entombed
miners will be rescued alive. The ex
plosion was of terrific force and shat
tered windows a mile distant.
Immediately after the shock ereat
number* of miners, who were off duty.
rushed to the shaft to find great clouds
of smoke and dust gushing from its
mouth. Mothers, children and other
relatives soon were weepinr and plead
ing for the rescue of those dear to
them entombed in the mine. The offi
cials of the mine were soon on the
6cene.
The cause of the explosion has not
yet been determined. Most of the min
ers are Italians and Hungarians.
The company usually works about
seventy-five miners in this shaft, but
to-day being Sunday the men were
not all in and the small loss of life can
be attributed only to this fact.
The United States Coal and Coke

Be Introduced To-Day

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 26. â Senator
Dryden will present a bill in the Sen
ate to-morrow to carry into effect the
President's recommendation for the
regulation of insurance by the Federal
Government.
There is no intention of pressing the
measure to final action during the few
remaining day? of this session, but the
introduction of the bill at this time
shows that those who have been giv
ing- the subject thought since the
declaration in behalf of legislation in
this direction have put into concrete
fcrm the proposed provisions of a law
d' fining insurance as interstate com
rr.erce in such way as to remove, in
the opinion of many eminent lawyers,
any constitutional objection to the
proposition and at the same time avoid
any infringement of the rights of in
dividual States.
The bill will set forth that policies
of insurance are articles of commerce
and instrumentalities thereof and that
the delivery of contracts of insurance
by a corporation of one State into an
other State shall be deemed transac
tions in interstate or foreign com
merce, as the case may be, and there
fore subject to the control of the Na
tional Government.
Briefly these are some of the most
direct benefits to be derived from the
passage of the bill in question:
First â Increased security to twenty
million policy-holders.
Second â Decrease in the cost of in
surance.
Third â Increased returns to policy- ,
holders.
Fourth â Decrease in the burden of
taxation.
Fifth â Diminution of a vast amount
or needless clerical labor to meet the
requirements of some fifty different
States and Territories and consequent
decrease In expense.
Sixth- â The stamping out of fraudu
lent insurance enterprises.
SECRETLY WEDS
VICTORIA BELLE
Modestly inscribed on the register of
the St. Francis Hotel is the signature
Li Arthur D. Ward of St. Paul. It
was written there oh February 21 and
would probably have parsed notice
w ithout exciting more than ordinary
; curiosity had it not been for the fact
.that Saturday there was added to the
signature "and wife." But for the in
; discreet move on the part of Ward the
; fact that he had been quietly married
in this city to a beautiful young woin
i an, one of the acknowledged belles
of Victoria, B. C, would perhaps have
not been discovered until he had fully
enjoyed with his bride their honey
moon on this coast and started on
their homeward journey to St. Paul.
Ward is prominently identified with
the management of the Great
Western Railroad Company, with
headquarters in St. Paul, and his
present visit to San Francisco was
solely for the purpose of claiming the
hand of Miss Florence V. Meissonier.
The marriage, which was quietly
solemnized Saturday at the rectory of
Trinity Episcopal Church, was intended
to be kept a secret until the happy
couple could reach St. Paul, but those
attractive words "and wife" affixed to
Ward's name on the hotel register
spoiled the well laid plans.
Mrs. Ward is an exceedingly at
tractive woman, who only recently re
turned from a prolonged visit to the
Southern States, where, for a time, she
was the guest of the family of General
Shelby in Kentucky. It was during her
visit in the South that Ward first met
his bride and an acquaintance quickly
ripened into a love match. A distance
of thousands of miles separating the
couple did not in the least lessen the
ardent wooing of the railroad man, who
was finally successful in securing from
the fair Victorian a promise of mar
riage.
It was arranged some time ago that
the marriage should be celebrated in
California a few months hence and
Ward even went so far as to invite a
number of his friends In the railroad
world to accompany him to San Fran
cisco in a private car to witness the
ceremony. Suddenly his patience ex
hausted itself and a few days ago he
surprised his fiancee by coming here
alone. He insisted on an immediate
fulfillment of her nuptial pledge and a
wedding was hastily arranged. Satur
day witnessed the realization of Ward's
happiest hopes and since then Mr. and
Mrs. Ward have been, quietly living at
the St. Francis. To-day they leave on
their honeymoon trip, which will end
on their arrival in St. Paul.
Although Mrs. Ward spent several of
her early years In Victoria she is well
remembered here, especially by former
students of Miss Lake's school, which
she attended for a long time. Return
ing recently from her Eastern visit
she went to live with friends at 1605
Franklin street, where her finance
f;:und her when he suddenly made his
appearance a few days ago in San
Francisco.

the big special was Rita Newman, who

pared a warm welcome for her in her
native city.
Manager Chas. R. Bacon, who is well

scenery required for the productions
in the company's repertory.
The company carries the largest
wardrobe of any similar organization.
the outfit is worth a small fortune.
There is scarcely an ancient monarch
of Europe or Africa who could not
step from his grave into this great
wardrobe, fit himself up in the dress
of the day in which he left the earth
and move on as though time had not
rolled up in the meanwhile a matter
of three, four or five hundred years.
Not even the ill-fated Marie An-
toinette, whose gowns were without
number, but not without price, boasted
a wardrobe so rich and elaborate as
that which this opera company must
take wherever it sings. Then there are
the heavy and almost countless pieces
of scenery, including the two hundred
and fifty "drops," tons of platforms
and solid interior settings for such pro
ductions as "Othello," "Tosca." "Loh
engrin," and "Tannhauser."
Mr. Savage's working staff of car
penters and electricians took posses
sion of the stage at the Columbia im
mediately after the performance last
night to make the necessary alterations
for the elaborate productions that are
to be shown during the grand opera
festival. The local management also
put on a force of men to remove three
rows of seats and construct a new
pit for the grand opera orchestra of
fifty musicians. Another force of
workmen is overhauling the staee and
preparing enlarged accommodations un
derneath for the force of wardrobe
women and property men.
The company will open at the Co
lumbia to-night in Verdi's "Othello."
to be repeated Thursday evening and
at the Saturday matinee, Bizet's "Car
men" being sung on Tuesday and
Thursday and the following Sunday
evenings, with Wagner's "Lohengrin"
on Wednesday and Saturday evenings.

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 27.âEvi
dence is Increasing that the strikes
throughout the empire, especially those
in St. Petersburg, are not economic in
their origin, but are inspired by a
definite political plan. The Government
and employers are embarrassed by the
tactics of the workmen, whose dis
content is being fed and who are in
creasing demands with each new con
cession. This condition is believed to
have been fomented by crafty politi
cal agitators, who are stirrinc ud the
men and at the same time holdine them
in leash, apparently waiting some siK
nal for concerted action. Fear is en
tertained that this widespread agitation
may be connected with a plan to await
a possible peasant outbreak in the
spring, with which a general strike will
be synchronized, the workmen joining
hands with the peasants.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 26.â At the be

on by Congress and approved by the
President. This is the legislative, ex

The Senate still has seven of the

next Saturday is gigantic, but none

Conferees, appointed on the part of

after reading Osier's speech and the \

"Did he use chloroform? "
When the answer was in the negative
he had no more to say.
A multitude of letters, telegrams and ;
clippings have been forwarded to the :
doctor. Some of them have been con- i
gratulatory and others threatening. '
The majority of them, Osier says, take
issue with him. The doctor's allusion
to the fictional method or getting rid of
sexagenari by chloroform has caused* .
him some worry and trouble. Dr.
Osier regards the whole affair in a
si no-humorous light.
Dr. Osier was asked if the Senators |
and Representatives who had been
named as contradictions to his theory (
were comparatively useless. He '
answered:
"In many cases the work done by
those men could have been better done j
by younger men. "
CHICAGO, Feb. 26.â 0n the theory I
that correct living and a proper amount
of encouragement will prolong man's
period of productive labor. Bishop
Samuel Fallows of St. Pauls Reformed |
Episcopal Church, in a sermon to-day ;
on "The Old Men of the Bible" takes
issue with Professor Osier, who has 'â 
declared that the creative period of
mut'g intellect is confined between the
ages of 25 and 40 and that a steady
decline follows antil the age of 60, when
a man is comparatively worthless. '
Said Dr. Fallows:
A distinguished ccientific writer, Elie Metch- '
inkoff. concurs" in the declaration made In
flnnmll that the days of man ar* 120 years. '
The latest physiological Investigations prove
this to be the case.
It Is a significant fact that the average
duration of life Is continually growing greater.
Correct living will yet hring the rare to the
normal figure. In the light of these facts the
contention of Professor Osier that the creative
perloU of man's intellect is between twenty
rivo and forty, and that there is a steady de
cline until the comparatively worthless age of
sixty is reacheo, must be taken with consider
able allowance. The period of creative lnt> I
lect ought to be advanced to seventy years.
Men must be encouraged to prolong the pc- i
rlod of productive labor. No artificial dead |
line should be established. â¢'Tempeiate in all
things." as a rule of life, will push old age ;
far toward tho scriptural and divine limit.
The worlds work will thus be done by the
young men of seventy.

MYSTERY VEILS
WOMAN'S DEED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO. Feb. 26.â Mystery sur
rounds a visitor who came to this city
last Friday and placed a 7-year-old
child in the Children's Home. She
said the child was given to her by a
couple in Santa Paula.
Inquiry at Santa Paula develops the
fact that the woman took the child
there a few months ago and called for
it last Thursday. The woman gave the
name of Helen Rush and said the
child's name was Ramona Garcy. The
little one, through an interpreter, says
that her name is Maria Martinez and
that the woman is known as Alice
Rose.
From the child It has been learned
that she once lived in Honduras. After
the death of her mother she was
brought to Los Angeles by her god
mother, Castora Mara. One day, the
little one says, while on an errand for
godmother, "Mrs. Rose, or Mrs.
Rush, took her by the hand and led
her to a house, where her hair was cut
off and she was reclothed from head
to foot. Later she was taken to Santa
Paula, where she was told that she
was to be called Ramona Garcy,

JAP IS POLITE
EVER IN SOUP
J. Nuguchi, Who* Falls Three
Stories Into a Dining-
Room, Apologizes for It
ALIGHTS IN TUKEEN
Little Brown Man Drops In
Among the Guests at
the Hotel Buckingham
Japanese politeness stood the test of
a thirty-foot fall through a transom
into a soup tureen. The little brown
man, who remembered his manners in
such a strait, is J. Nuguchi, porter at
The Buckingham, 655 Sutter street.
It was dinner time on Saturday
night at that hostelry. The guests
had seated themselves in the dining
hall. Directly under a lightwell stood
a table upon which was placed the
soup tureen.
Suddenly there was a rumbling,
then a shattering of glass. Something
dropped upon the table with an awful
thud. It was Nuguchi, commonly
known as Joe. He had fallen thirty
feet through the lightwell.
Women shrieked and turned away,
not caring to see the mangled remains.
One man rushed out to telephone for
an ambulance, another called for the
morgue.
In the midst of the confusion Nugu
chi arose. Part of the transom was
around his neck and the soup tureen
clung tenaciously to one foot. But
Nuguchi did not forget his manners.
Brushing the rice tomato from his
brow with a courtly gesture, he said:
"Excuse, please, for spill soup. lam
much sorry, if you please. Honorably
pardon and I will haste to tell cook
to make more soup in place of hon
orable soup which was spilled."
The guests who had been horrified
an instant before burst into laughter.
Mrs. H. Signor, the proprietor, realized
that it was no use crying over spilt
soup and forgave the penitent Jap.
When Nuguchi saw the smiles he
felt relieved. The fact that he had
escaped death by a seemiag miracle
had not impressed him. He was only
concerned about the honorable soup
i that had been spilled.
"I was reading' the second reader,
which Is a very difficult lesson," he
I explained. "Then I descented with
i haste and became in the soup."
FALSE FRIEND
ROBS HEIKES
Kanchman From Santa Bar
bara Victim of Former Fel
low Employe at Ocean Beach
Edward Heikes, who came to the city
yesterday from a ranch in Santa Bar
bara, is bemoaning the loss of $10 taken
from him by a false friend last night
at the beach. Heikes was invited to a
dance by a friend named "Harry,"
whom he met on the ranch at Santa
Barbara. Harry said that the dance
was to take place at the beach and es
corted Heikes there. When they
reached Forty-ninth avenue and H
street a third man joined the party.
They proceeded along the car tracks
till they came to the Ocean boulevard.
There the supposed friend ordered
Heikes to throw up his hands, at the
sarm time flourishing a revolver to
enforce the demand. The other man
went through Heikes' pockets in search
of plunder. Heikes started to defend
himself and was struck repeatedly with
the butt of the revolver, receiving sev
eral ugly gashes in the scalp and face.
His outcries alarmed his assailants,
who fled after taking $10 from him.
Heikes was taken to the Park Hospital
for treatment and later reported his
loss and the attack to the police at
the Park station. He does not know
"Harry's" last name.

GAS EXPLOSION
WRECKS HOUSE
An explosion of gas in the basement
of a house at 995 Lombard street last
night about 8 o'clock wrecked the
building and caused the serious injury
of Paul Overmohle, the occupant.
Overmohle was badly burned about the
face and hands and will be confined
to his bed for some days. An alarm
of fire was sent in, but before the de
partment arrived the flames had
burned themselves out.
The house had been vacant for some
time. It was rented last Friday to
Paul Overmohle, a driver. The new
tenant moved his furniture into the
place Saturday. He notified the gas
company to turn on the illuminating
fluid, but reckoned not on the procras
tinating proclivities of the gas man.
Last night, finding that the servant
i of the light trust had not yet put in
j an appearance. Overmohle thought he
' would turn on the gas himself. Armed
with a candle the tenant wended his
way to the basement. He turned on
something â of that he is sure.
Last night Overmohle again visited
the house. He smelled gas. Tracing
the odor of nitrous oxide to the base
ment, he lit a match. There was a ter
rific explosion. The frightened man
was thrown twenty feet, landing
against the wall. The gas burst into
flames, burning him seriously about the
head and arms. All of his hair was
consumed. Every window in the house,
up stairs and down, was blown out.
The casements and doors were
wrecked and the front wall was blown
out of plumb. The damage will amount
to about $2000.
The building Is owned by Thomas G.
Jacques of Â«898 Lombard street.
Overmohle was taken to a friend's
house and attended by Dr. Bacigalupi.

House in Los Angeles
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26. â Fire of
unknown origin destroyed the rear of
the Irwin, a fashionable family hotel
on South Olive street, between Eighth
and Ninth, at 4 o'clock this morning
and caused a panic among the several
families which occupied the place.
Several persons narrowly escaped
death by suffocation.
The fire was discovered by a pas
serby, who burst open the front door
and ran through the smoke-filled hall
ways and aroused the inmates. The
people in the house had only time to
seize such clothing as was near their
beds and flee to the street. The fire
men carried out one man, having
found him in a hallway overcome with
smoke. He quickly revived.
Neighbors took care of the occu
pants of the house and supplied them
with clothing. It was necessary to
sound a second alarm summoning
four additional engine companies be
fore the firemen could check the
spread of the flames and prevent the
loss of adjoining rooming-houses with
which the street is closely lined.
The property loss will not exceed
$7500, but some of the guests lost
property which cannot be replaced.
UPHOLDS AIMS
OF THE UNIONS
Professor Gray of North
* western University Defends
Closed Shop and Boycott
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
CHICAGO, Feb. 26. â Professor John
H. Gray of Northwestern University
upheld the closed shop, the sympa
thetic strike and boycott in a lecture
in the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion Auditorium this afternoon. He
disagreed with Professor Eliot of
Harvard University, who declared the
non-union man a good type of the
American hero, and said the man who
refused to join a union was the fel
low who wanted to eat his cake and
have it. too."
"Do you consider it right to pre
vent non-union men working?" asked
a man in the audience,
"If you mean slugging, shooting or
killing him, I do not consider it right.
But it is right under certain circum
stances to persuade him not to work,
and it is eminently proper to refuse to
work with him. Eminently proper."
Gray declared that much of the an
tagonism shown to labor unions was
the result of ignorance and that the
average union man knew a great deal
more about social science and eco
nomic law than the average million
aire employer.
"If the main objects of labor unions,
which are to better the conditions of
their members, are right, and I hold
they are right, then it is ethically
proper to resort to the sympathetic
strike, the boycott, or the closed shop
to carry out these objects. All of
these things are purely matters of
expediency. All this talk we hear
about individual liberty is anarchy.
A man who refuses to join a union be
cause he believes in individual liberty
is an anarchist and fails to recognize
the brotherhood of man. He falls to
recognize that he is but one of a
class."

In Search for Remains of Paul Jones
Another Casket 13
Found.
PARIS, Feb. 26. â A preliminary
search, which EmbassadOi- Porter is
making for the body of John Paul
Jones, the naval hero of the Revolu
ticnary war, recently disclosed a lead
co*nn. The name plate on the coffin
was very much corroded, but the in
scription has finally been deciphered
showing that it is the coffin of an
Englishman buried on May 5, 1790,
two years before the d3at.ll of Jones.
Cci sequently the coffin will not bs
opened. The search <vill be con
tinued.
The finding of this lead coffin has
the advantage of establishing the fact
that those buried in the cemetery
about the time of Jones' deatn lie in
the vicinity of the present excavations.

COUNTY HOSPITAL INMATE
ONCE GLADSTONE'S BUTLER
Former Servant of England's Grand
Old Man Now an Object of
Charity.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26. â Suffering
from an incurable disease, destitute
and without friends in this part of
the world, a man who was once Wllli
iam E. Gladstone's butler and was
one of the heirs of England's "Grand
Old Man," is a patient at the Los
Angeles County Hospital, a public
charge, dependent upon county
charity for what he gets there. The
man's name is John Williams. He Is
a native of Wales.
For eight years. Williams was in
Gladstone's service at Hawarden, and
by him was bequeathed $2300. Com
ing to America he was for several
years butler in the service of Colonel
Cochrane of Boston, and many times
served the late President McKinley
when the latter was a guest at the
Cochrane home. Then he invested in
a seagoing vessel and sailed on her.
The venture was financially dis
astrous, and broken in health, Will
iams came to Southern California
probably to die.

LUCKY STRIKE
OF PROSPECTOR
Locates Six Claims He As
serts Are So Rich That
the Sight Made Him Dizzy
Special Dispatch to The CalL
TACOMA, Feb. 2Â«.â After prospect
ing for seven years from Upper Yukon
to Bering Sea, F. W. Harris has dis
covered what appears to be a moun
tain of gold-bearing ore which assures
him of great fortune.
Harris, in company with David A.
Rearick, has located six claims on
Salmon River, seven miles from where
it empties into Portland Canal and
seventeen miles from tide water. He
describes the location as a mountain
on which is exposed a vein of ore
twenty-five feet wide and so rich that
it made him dizzy when he examined
it. An avalanche is supposed to have
laid bare the rich vein. Harris and
Rearick are not certain whether the
claims are in Alaska or British Co
lumbia. While gold-bearing, the ore
contains enough silver to make the
claim worth working on that account
alone. Canadian assays show 1000
ounces of silver to the ton.
WILL VETO BILL MOVING
CAPITAL OF WASHINGTON
Governor Mead Opposed to Plan to

State Government.
TACOMA. Feb. 26. â Governor
Mead will to-morrow veto the bill sub
mitting to a vote of the people at
the next general election the matter
of moving the State capital from
Olympia to Tacoraa. The Governor
regards the change of the capital as
unbusinesslike in view of the com
pletion during the present month of a
Capitol at Olympia costing $600,000.
The matter will be taken to t,he Su
preme Court, it being"'claimed that the
law is in the form of a constitutional
amendment and that the Governor has
no authority to either * approve or
veto it.

STUDENTS WANT
TO HAVE "SAY"
Voice in Councils That De
termine Fate of Pupils De
sired by University Men
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street. Feb. 26.
Before the students of the University
determine, by vote on March 7, whether
to approve the plan for an undergradu
ate committee of students' affairs, to
act in conjunction with the faculty
committee of the same title, a public
debate of the question is to be held. At
Stiles hall next Tuesday night the
ablest debaters 1n the Univefcjjfty who
are members of the "senate" will dis
cuss before the students this question:
"Resolved, that it would be for the best
interests of the university to place the
management of students' affairs in the
hands of an undergraduate committee."
One week from the time of this de
bate the polls will be opened and the
young men and women of the colleges
v.ill register their opinion in this mat
ter, deemed by student leaders to be
one of the most important questions
arising for decision in many years. It
is declared by those who advocate a
students' affairs committee that the
present "strained relations" between
the student body and the faculty com
mittee on student affairs, to quote a
recent editorial in the students' daily,
The Californian, would be changed if
students had some representation in
bodies that determine the fate of stu
dents when disciplinary measures are
under consideration.
The "strained relations" came to a
head last term when the faculty com
mittee on Btudent affairs procured the
suspension, for a year, of W. T. Hale,
editor of the Californian, for his con
nection with the insurrection attend
ing Captain Nance's celebrated orders
to the seniors, to fall in line and march
in order into his classroom.
There followed, after that episode,
action by the executive committee of
the Associated Students in the shape of
a proposal to have formed the students'
committee on students' affairs to assist
in disciplining students when neces
sary, and to insure fairness when
students were on trial. It is this pro
posed innovation which all the students
will be called upon to vote for or
against, one week from next Tuesday,
and to debate next Tuesday night.
Other events scheduled to take place
at the university during this week are
a lecture before the college of com
merce to-morrow at 4 o'clock by George
w. Dickie on "Some Aspects of the
Labor Problems"; a lecture in French
on Tuesday by Robert Dupouey, en
titled "Popular Festivities in France";
senior singing on North Hall steps on
Thursday evening; a discussion of the
nature of radium, by Dr. F. G. Cottrell
at the chemical laboratory on Friday,
at 11 o'clock; students' night at the
grand opera season in San Francisco
on Friday night; the annual oratorical
contest of the Prohibition League at
Stiles Hail on Friday night, and the
T'niversity Assembly at Reed Hall in
Oakland at 9 o'clock, Friday night.

John N. Bishop
Suddenly Goes
to Rest.
OAKLAND, Feb. 26.â After an Ill
ness of but little less than two weeks
and just when strong hopes were en
tertained for his recovery Sheriff John
N. Bishop of Alameda County died
very suddenly this evening at his home,
1611 Twelfth street. Sheriff Bishop's
death came as a great shock to his
family, all of whom had thought that
the crisis in his illness had been safely
passed and that he was well on the
road to recovery.
The Sheriff's family physician. Dr. O.
D. Hamiin, had been at the house
scarcely an hour before death came,
and had expressed hope that the worst
was over. Only a moment before the
end came the Sheriff had been convers
ing with the nurse who was attend
ing him, and had said that he was ko
ing to get well. In the midst of the
conversation he suddenly gasped for
breath, and a moment later all was
over. Dr. Hamiin was hurriedly sum
moned, but when he arrived life had
been extinct for some time.
John N. Bishop was born in Nova
Scotia, Canada, and at the time of
his death was forty-seven years of age.
He came to California in 1879 and en
tered the construction department of
the Southern Pacific Company. A few
years later he was appointed a fore
man of construction, which position
he held until May, 1902, when he re
signed to make a campaign for the
office of Sheriff of Alameda County.
He received the nomination of the Un
ion Labor party, and was elected by
a close majority, defeating Oscar Roer
ers, the Republican candidate. Dur
ing the time that he has been Sheriff
Mr. Bishop has proved a competent
official and by his courtesy has won a
host of friends.
While in the employ of the Southern
Pacific Company, Mr. Bishop was mar
ried to Miss Ada Lowell of this city.
Besides his widow he leaves two daugh
ters and one son. He also leaves two
brothers and five sisters.
Sheriff Bishop was a member of Al
catraz Lodge No. 244, F. and A. M..

a member of the Knights Templar and

The funeral will be held Wednesday

FARMERS CAN
LEARN BY MAIL
University Plans to Give In
struction to Citizens Who
Are Far From Its Walls
OUTLINES OF SCHE3IE
It Is Purposed to Teach
by Literature That Will
Keach Farmers at Home
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Feb. 26.
Farmers of the State can be taught
useful lessons In agriculture, with the
University of California aa their teach
er, if they so desire, now that the de
partment of agriculture has matured
its plans for their enlightenment-
Assistant Superintendent Clarke, who
has helped to direct the holdings of
farmers' institutes, has chartfe of the
"instruction by mail" feature of the
university's work. HÂ» is now prepar
ing suitable literature, dealing with
agricultural problems, which will be
sent to farmers to be studied by them.
In speaking of the courses to be of
fered farmers, Mr. Clarke said to-day:
The first reading course thus prepared and
offered Is entitled "A reading course In econ
omic entomology." Tha literature of the course
is made up by binding In book form the vari
ous bulletins and circulars dealing with in
sect problems issued from this station. There
are fifteen of these publications thus brought
together and with them Is bound a circular,
giving full directions for study.
This circular was prepared br Prof awe CL
Woodworth. and Is in reality a text book on
the study of entomology. We hayÂ« also ob
tained from other experiment stations and
from the United States Department of Agri
culture bulletins dealing with the same sub
jects. The publications thus gathered to
gether number 100 and when bound make
three volumes.
"We have also published a number of stand
ard works for uÂ»Â« In the coarse. Oar method
is to furnish the persona registering in the
course the book of bulletins, which book the
student Is to keep until the course Is com
pleted, when It will become his property. Reg
istration in this course Is open to all who
desire to itudy In this way and there are no
fees to be paid. The university extension took
up this work and we expect to have hundreds
of students. New courses will soon be added
and we believe that the work, thus carried
out, wUI be of great value to the agricultural
Interests of the State. Our Interests in ani
mal Industries, in general horticulture and
other deoartments of farm work demand an
expert knowledge of the problems involved, and
the reading course for farmers materially as
sists In bringing this desideratum about.
ALAMEDA. Feb. 2Â«. â Pique orer
a Quarrel with her mother is what led
Mrs. Georgia Page to leave her home
Friday and remain overnight Satur
day, incidentally alarming her rela
tives to the extent of causing them
to report to the police they feared
she had made away with herself. Yes
terday morning the woman learned
from the newspapers that the police
were looking for her and she went to
the local police station to-night and
told the officer in charge that the
force might stop their search. She
said she was glad to have frightened
her mother so much, but was sorry
for thÂ» publicity and the trouble Â»*ie
had caused the police. She had been
in San Francisco while her relatives
were anxiously hunting, she said, and
had left her home because of a dis
agreement with her mother, Mrs. F.

DRUNKEN BRAWL
ENDS SERIOUSLY
Elmer Angel's Arm Is Cut
to Bone by Fall Through
Window of a Eesidence
Elmer Angel, a laborer living in a
lodging-house at 216% Sixth street, was
fatally wounded in a drunken brawl
late yesterday afternoon. He and sev
eral others were guests of the land
lady of the house, Mrs. Margaret Hart.
Among those present was a Greek
restaurant man named Emanuel Nich
ols, who lives at 22A Moss avenue, and
conducts a chophouse at 201 Ellis
street. With Nichols were his wife and
6-year-old child. In a playful mood.
Angel seized Nichols' child and was
romping round the room with it on
his shoulders. The father became
alarmed and got the chil 1. In the
scuffle Angel was pushed, or fell,
through the rear window. The glass
broke, nearly severing his arm from
his shoulder. He was rushed to the
Central Emergency Hospital, where
Dr. R. C. Hill ascertained that the
brachial artery, the largest one in the
arm, was severed, together with all of
the muscles and tendons down to the
bone. Angel had loet bo much blood
that he was unconscious. Dr. Hill
transfused a quart of saline solution
into the man's veins, to take the place
of the lost blood.
Nichols was arrested pending the re
sult of Angel's injuries. He denies that
he shoved Angel through the window
and says the drunken man toppled in
his intoxication. Patrick J. Dwyer. El
mer Howell and the landlady, Mrs.
Hart, who were present at the time,
all say that Angel's injuries were the
result of his own intoxication and
thoroughly exonerate Nichols of any
connection \?lth the accident. At a
late hour Angel was not expected to
recover.

in' a Boom Full of Gas
MISHAP JS AN ACCIDENT
Vigilant Employe Makes a
Timely Discovery While
. rationing Hotel* Hallway
â Cement of the Occidental
Hotel is congratulating iiself on the
happy ract that one of its trustful em
ployes a few nights ago became per
sonally responsible for the present
mortal existence of Joseph B. L*uck,
California's enthusiastic and hard
working adjutant general.
The general, on the eventful night in
qu>e6tion, attended a supper at the Oc
cidental, where he was a temporary
t^est, and later repaired to his room
in quest of sleep. In a careless mo
ment he turned off the gas in his room
avid then accidentally turned it on
again, a fact he was not made to real-
Ixe until several hours later, when he
v.as rescued from the suffocating at
mosphere of his apartments by the
hotel watchman. The faithful servant.
In making his rounds, detected the
odor of gas and finally traced it to
General Lauck's room.
Failing to get a prompt response to
& knock, the watchman forced an en
trance to the room and found General
Lauck breathing heavily. The room
â was filled with the escaping gas and
the vatchman wasted no time In get
â¢ he general out into the hotel cor
ridor, where he slowly revived under
the influence of the fresher air. But
for the timely discovery by the watch
man, who, only a few weeks ago, found
a regular army officer in a similar pre
dicament. General Lauck would have
probably died. The following day the
general returned to Sacramento, where
he has since remained, slowly recover
ing from the nauseating effects of his
inhalation of the gas.

HOT SPRINGS. Ark.. Feb. Sun
day has been a day of gloom in Hot

servative estimate places the loss at
$1,500,000. Besides the three unidenti
fied bodies recovered yesterday no fur
ther loss of life has been reported.
The citizens' relief committee has, the
situation well in hand, although volun
tary subscriptions from the outside are
being accepted. All trains to-day
brought in visitors to view the ruins.
Mayor Belding has ordered all saloons
riaeed. â Ttie following -statementâ has 1
been issued: i
To the Public: The fire-swept area, lies prln- !
cipally In the residence portion of the city,
While he loss Is enormous the principal busi
ness portion of Hot Springs. Including the ho
tels and bathhouses, are not affected. We
think It, therefore, proper to request the As
sociated Press to state that our city has am
file accommodations for the people who may
desire to visit It for health and no advance
in rates will be tolerated.
GEORGE P. BELDrNG, Mayor.
The devastated district will be
speedily rebuilt. Property owners are
already planning with architects and
in three instances carpenters began
work to-day on temporary structures.

VESSEL TOWED 13,000
MILES COMES TO PORT
Steamer Atlas Brings an Oil
Barge From New York.
The longest t<\\ known in the his
tory of marine affairs was broupht to
a Wll i i*MfUi fonclusion yesterday,
wtcUl ihÂ»- â teauner Alias rame Into port
ieudir.p thr Standard Oil Company's
barge No "C. These vessels left Ne v
York Eeveaty-two days ago. During
this !<â¢;.Â£; period a great steel cable 350
fathoms in lensth has held them to
gether. It parted but once, and then
only for an hour.
The Atlas had 15.000 barrels of fuel
oil on board when she sailed from New
York. and hat: now about 5000 barrels
left in her tanks. The barge has in her
tanks 1,255,000 gallons of naphtha.
The only port stopped at during the
voyage was Punta Arenas, from which
port they Failed on January 26.
Captain Thomas Fenlon. commander
of the Atlas, said that in the Straits of
Magellan they experienced thick,
foggy* weather, with the wind blowing
to beat the band." They were three
days in the straits. He reports seeing
the British steamer Cumbal, which
went ashore some time ago in Smythes
Channel. When seen she was about
half lightered, and it was expected it
would take a month's time to float her.
The Cumbal was bound for Valparaiso
with general oargo at the time she ran
ashore.
The total distance covered was 13,090
miles, straight run. When the vessels
parted company in the North Atlantic
it was due to the automatic towing
machine on the barge giving out. A
new hawser was at once put out. and
this hawser has been in constant use
for 11.000 mile*. Both steamer and
barge will be employed in coast trade
here.
The Atlas was built for the Standard
Oil Company at Chester, Pa., in 1898.
She is 24S feet long. 40 feet 1 inch beam
and 22 feet v inches deep. Her net ton
nage is 1243. The average speed on the
trip was nine and a half knots, but
\\ithout tow the Atlas can make about
fourteen knots. The crew of the Atlas
numbers twenty-five, but on this trip a
stowaway was found after leaving
New York, so 6he has twenty -six on
her articles. Barge No. 93 is in com
mand of Captain Edward Erickson.
The barge is a peculiar-looking ob
ject, something like a four-masted
schooner. Her masts are of steel. Her
foremast also answers the purpose of a
smokestack, and long clouds of smoke
were streaming out of it as she lay at
anchor off Meiggrs Wharf yesterday
afternoon. This smoke comes from her
engine room forward. Her steering
gear and all the general mechanism
are run by steam power, but she la<?ks
steam-propelling power. She is about
two years old, is built of steel and is a
thoroughly up-to-date oil-tank barge.
She is 280 feet long. 45 feet beam and 21
feet depth. Her capacity is 28,000 bar
rels of oil, but on this trip she only
brought 21.000 barrels. The great cable
six inches in circumference, which had
kept the two ships in company, was
coiled up on the barge yesterday. In
one place it showed a great strain at
a point where it had been joined to
ajether. smd but a few strands remained
In contact. It could not have held out
for many more miles.
A mascot in shape of a sort of goat,
â¢which was taken on board at Punta
Arenas, was gayly frisking about the
deck of the Atlas, evidently glad to be
in sight of land once more.
Oreffon Detained by Fog.
The steamship Oregon, bound for Portland,
left her dock promptly at 11 o'clock, yesterday
morning, but as the fog in the bay was dense
Captain Warner anchored off Folsom street,
where he remained until 2:10 p. m. when the
Oregon proceeded to sea.
Ix>san to Sail To-Morrow.
The transport Logan will sail to-morrow for
Manila, and will be the first vessel to inaugur
ate the sailing of transport" on the last day or
the month, instead of on the first, as has here
tofore been the custom. The IÂ»gnn carries
the Sixth Infantry.
San Jose Behind Time.
The Pacific Mall Steamship Company's
steamer San Jose, which was due from Pana
ma yesterday, failed to put in appearance.
Heavy coast fogs are supposed to be respon
sible for ker non-arrival.
Alameda Due To-Morrow.
The Oceanic Steamship Company s steamer
Alameda Is due to-morrow from Honolulu.
Crowds Visit Ohio.
All day yesterday great crowds of visitors
took advantage of the sunny weather and went
out to the big battleship Ohio and swarmed
ever her from stern to stern.

Automobiles and Wagons Collide.
There were several families in the
Western Addition left without their
milk yesterday. This loss occurred by
the upsetting of numerous cans, which
were sent promiscuously over the
streets by reason of automobiles com
ing in collision with two wagons,
which were rendered total wrecks.
The first to meet with its doom was
at Fell and Buchanan streets, where
a wagon belonging to the Jersey
ranch was put out of business by be
ing hit by an automobile at 2:30 a. m.,
when every drop of the milk was spilt
over the street and the wagon
smashed into kindling wood. The au
tomobile made good its escape before
Its chauffeur could be identified.
The second wagon to come to grief
was one belonging to the Point Farm
Dairy, which was hit by another â or
maybe the same â at 4 a. m.. on Golden
Gate avenue, between Octavia and La
guna streets. The contents of the
wagon met a like fate as the other so
far as its contents were concerned.
This time the chauffeus was identified
as I. J. Story, who had in charge auto
419. Fortunately, neither of the
wagon drivers was injured. In the
last case the horse ran away some dis
tance before it was stopped.
DESTRUCTIOX BY WAVES
IS FATE OF THE ONWARD
MARSHFIELD, Or., Feb. 26.â The
three-masted schooner Onward that
ran upon the reef while attempting to
cross Coquille River bar , yesterday
cannot be saved. A heavy sea car
ried her stern first almost into the
jetty. In an effort to make deep wa
ter she struck broadside against Table
Rock. Dragging her anchors she
drifted on the neighboring reef.
The Onward will be a total wreck,
as she has pounded on the rocks -for
many hours. Pieces of wreckage are
said to be coming ashore. The crew
safely reached land.

PUBLICATION OmCBI THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. MAS FRANCISCO
MONDAY FEBRUARY 27, 1905
BUSINESS GOOD, BUT FEATURELESS.
BUSINESS is still proceeding on monotonous lines, and through
out the whole country the field of trade is practically feature
less With better weather in the Eastern and Western Mates
the distribution of merchandise exhibits expansion, but beyond this
statement there is very little to be said.pf business in general. Ihe
regular barometers, such as the clearings and the iron and provision
trades, remain in about the conditions reported a week ago. Ihe
clearings gained 46.7 per cent over the corresponding week in 1904,
with an aggregate total of $2,277,000,000. The failures were 252,
against 240 last year. .
The staples show no marked variation one way or the other.
Iron and steel still lead all others in point of activity, and the mills
and furnaces are fully employed. Provisions rule quiet at Chicago
and other large Western centers. There is less activity in wool at
Eastern points, and the lower grades are showing easiness. Hides
and leather, too. are not as active as they were some little time ago.
Cotton is irregular, with no excitement, and the holders of the raw
product in the South have lately shown more disposition to meet
the market. The flurry in wheat at Chicago subsided along in the
early part of last week, and since then the market has been much
quieter. Fair activity in lumber and other building materials is re
ported. 9
The financial status of the country continues excellent. Money
is still remarkably abundant, not only in this country, but at all of
the leading European financial centers. Even Paris, to which point
the Vnited States has lately been shipping gold, reports a plethora
of funds, with little disposition to invest them. Monetary inertia
seems prevalent all over Europe. In this respect there is more doing
in the United States than elsewhere, for we at least have been mak
ing some heavy investments with our idle capital. In 1904 over
$450,000,000 new bonds and $222,000,000 new railroad stocks were
issued, making a total railroad stock and bond flotation of $670,000,
000. A good deal of this went toward taking up and turning over
old issues and short notes, but considerable was in new channels.
Investors in the principal Eastern centers are looking for safe stocks
and bonds yielding about 4 per cent, and standard issues paying this
rate find buyers right along. There is accordingly less talk about
idle money than at this time last year.
The abundance of cash funds has made Wall stseet thick
Skinned, and attacks by bears and plungers, which ordinarily would
cause a good deal of nervousness, now produce hardly any effect on
the market. Even the vast shrinkage in values of the stock of a
couple of huge trusts due to Federal and State attacks, and threat
ened energetic legislation along the same lines for some time to
come, have not depressed the general market to any extent. Holders
of standard bonds and stocks read of these legislative campaigns and
the consequent sharp shrinkages in values, lift their eyebrows and
pass indifferently on. Placidity prevails over the financial pool.
Crop prospects continue excellent. The winter wheat belt is
said to have sufficient snow protection to escape injury from the re
cent zero temperatures, while copious rains in the three Pacific Coast
States thus far insure abundant grain crops for the current year.
With the agricultural outlook thus propitious confidence naturally
prevails all over the country, and the average citizen feels that there
is nothing to worry over except death and taxes, which come along
with their old-time regularity. Something may turn up later on in
the season to damage trade conditions, but it is not yet in sight.
THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT'S MANSION.
T^HE bill introduced in the Legislature to appropriate $15,000 to
complete the building now standing in the grounds of the
University of California, which was originally intended for the
tcsidence of the president, is a good one and should pass.
The buiHing in question was erected some time ago for the
purpose of providing a residence in keeping with the dignity of the
office of president of the university. It was laid out on beautiful
architectural lines, was built of massive stone, and was intended in
every way to be worthy of the new university. It was finished so far
as the outside is concerned, but before the completion of the interior
the announcement was made that President Wheeler would not oc
cupy it because of the expense that would be entailed in maintaining
sojarge a household establishment.
Since that time work on the structure has stopped and it stands
to-day as an eyesore instead of the beautiful ornament to the uni
versity grounds that it should be. Aside from the object lesson to
citizens and to visitors of the university which a forlorn and half
finished building supplies, it is not good business policy to let the
structure fall into decay and so sacrifice the $30,000 already expended
upon it. If by the expenditure of $15,000 additional the building
can be completed, that money will be well spent. Under any condi
tions it will remain a permanent asset of the State, and if President
Wheeler does not wish to occupy it as a home, it will be useful
to the growing university in many other ways.
It is not fair to the taxpayers of the State or to the public spirit
of Berkeley to have a ruin facing the beautiful hillside residences of
that city, nor does it at present furnish an encouraging lesson to
those public-spirited citizens who have been generous with their
endowment* to the university and energetic in their efforts to make
it one of the most celebrated seats of learning as well as one of the
moÂ«t beautiful places to look upon in the whole country.
VARDAMAN AND MOBS.
WE art not required to indorse all of the manners of Governor
Yardaman of Mississippi when we a^ain salute him for hi?
personal efforts to prevent the mob lynching of negro crim
inals in his State. He has personally faced a savage mob and with
commendable courage has withstood it and made a plea for the law.
If negroes are to be burned for an unspeakable crime, let it be made
the law and then enforce it. If fire be supposed to be a deterrent
apent to prevent crime by the fear which its use inspires, let the law
apply trie torch and not a mob. Thi< will mean that the identifica
tion of the criminal must be complete, that crime is proved, and then
there is no need to quibble about the method of punishment, whether
'* he by rope or fire.
It is a satisfaction to commend the course of Governor Varda
man to other executives. He is not smooth in his manners, but he
is. in one respect, adding luster to the fame of his State. He is per
sonally opposing mobs, and by instruction to Sheriffs and use of the
militia is showing the courage of his convictions. If his growth in
grace continue he is HkeJy to be a model Governor as far as his in
ternal administration is concerned. He i* probably just the style of
man required by the conditions in his State, and we are for him for
Governor as often as he wants the office.
If the evident breech between the President and the Senate widens there
iÂ« a prompect of failure for most of the plans he has cherished for making his
administration memorable. With the legislative branch of the Government
Mr. Roosevelt would be very seriously handicapped.â Buffalo
Courier. '

NOT BEAUTIFUL, OPINES MR. MANAGER
AND OUT SHE GOES FROM AIRY
FAIRY LILLIAN'S COMPANY.
MISS MARION ALEXANDER.
MARION ALEXANDER, a very
pretty chorus girl, was dismissed
from Lillian Russell's "Lady
Teazle" company recently because
the stage manager did not think
her beautiful. She has since brought
HER COMPANY VOICE.
"Who is that in the parlor, Nellie?"
asked the I'ttle sister.
"Nobody but mamma and Fred," re
plied Nellie.
"Oh, yes, there must be some one
else," rejoined the little cirl, "for
mamma has her company voice on."
It was a little squib under the head
ing of "Fun," which a member of the
family read aloud frq/n the paper.
The circle about the table ho heard
it smiled and one said, "That's a good
jcke." But a more thoughtful mem
ber turned it over in her mind. She
was the mother, and she admitted
to herself that it was more than a
joke â that in many instances it was
sober truth. It came home to her
heart with great significance, for she
acknowledged to herself that "the
company voice" was entirely too often
put on when in the presence of those
outside the home circle. We wish to
appear at our best before those whose
good opinions we desire to gain. But
with those who love us how often we
speak in irritable, harsh, quick tones.

AMERICAN ACCENT.
An American correspondent protests
against the phrases "American accent"
and "nasal twang," which were used
in many reports of the Torrey-Alex
ander mission at Liverpool. For "the
impression is a general one that all
Americans talk through their noses.
The idea is quite as erroneous as if
one should assert that all English peo
ple talk cockney." The protest is
justifiable. There is no such things as
the "American accent," except in a few
words, such as "advertisement,"
wherein America is superior as to
pronunciation and practice.
Xor does the American-born man
"talk through his nose." The real dif
ference that we all notice is a differ
ence in the general pitch O"f the voice.
The American voice is pitched in a
slightly higher key than the English;
and here you may find the reason why
the American assimilates French so
easily. Put roughly, the case is this:
The Frenchman talks from his palate,
the American from the top of his
throat, the Englishman from his chest
and th? German from his diaphragm.

ELECTRICAL ENERGY
WITHOUT ANY
WIRES.
Some of the latest wonders of "wire
less" are described by Eugene R. Lyle
Jr. in the February World's Work. Hr
says: An inventor is in the field with
a wireless telephone. Another with a
submarine wireless telephone. A
Frenchman declares that he has a tel
autograph which by wireless repro
duces handwriting. Airships will of
course wish to communicate with one
another: at the St. Louis Fair one has
already "talked" with the earth by
wireless. And can a torpedo be guided
to its victim without a wire?
Indeed, the most astounding prospect
of all is that suggested by Nikoia
Tesla â for Tesla proposes the use of
wireless in transmitting energy. Pon
der a moment on what such a thing
would mean. A central plant would
generate power and send it out to cus
tomers via the air alone, whether
across a desert or over the high seas'.
An automobile climbing the Alps might
get its "push" from London or Paris.
An ocean liner would need no boilers,
no engines, no dynamo, no coal. Steam,
heat, light, would all come to it from
the land. A lone ranchman in Arizona
might set up a pocket-receiver and
learn the latest news. Millions of such
little receivers might be operate from
a single central station. Even the man
hel clock in a country home might tick
in unison with every other clock in
the world, all responding to the same
wireless impulse.
Other inventors say that the wire
less transmission of energy can never
be; it is impossible; it is contrary to
all natural laws. But, before now, ex
perts have declared a thing impossible
which has later come to pass.
A WONDERFUL 6HILD.
At three years of age John Stuart
Mill began the study of Greek, with
"arithmetic as an evening relaxation."
as Samuel Wellington puts it in the
Westminster Review.
At eight he began Latin, Euclid and
algebra, and had to act as tutor to the
younger children. He was a stern and
efficient tutor.
At twelve he began scholastic logic
and political economyâ the latter his
main lifework.
At fourteen, while paying a long
visit to Sir Samuel Bentham in South
ern France, he learned French as a
relaxation from studying two or three
hours before breakfast, five hours be
tween breakfast and dinner and two
or three in the evening. Being: for the
time master of his own hours and not
subject to a stern father, he took les
sons also in his spare hours in music.
Singing, dancing, fencing and riding,
but never became proficient.
At sixteen Mill could speak in debate
with adults with ease and freedom. At
eighteen he contributed to the West
minster Review. At twenty-two he
was made assistant in the India Office
and received a large salary for those
days.
* Butâ Mill was bald at twenty-two.
He did not marry until he was forty
flve. He himself said: "I never was a
boy. It is better to let nature have its
own way."
REALMS OF SCIENCE.
Prof. Brieger, of the Berlin Medical
Institute, was busily at work in his
laboratory, surrounded by a formid
able array of chemical and bacterio
logical utensils. A distinguished for
eign physician called upon him and
watched his absorbing labor with in
terest.
The professor's attention seemed to
be anxiously but still hopefully con
centrated on a vessel which was en-<
veloped in sm^ke and steam.
"Guess what 1 am boiling here in
this pot," said the professor.
The visitor began to enumerate the
entire scale of micro-organisms.
"Micrococci?"
"No."
"Sonococci?"
"No."
"Spirochaeta?"
"No."
"What then?"
"Sausages," replied Brieger.

GOOD MATCHMAKER
IS OLD WINTER.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
WINTER Is not generally re
garded as either a planting
or a harvest time of ro
mance. Spring is supposed
to inspire the youthful fancy to
thought* of love. The summer girl
has the reputation of excelling Cupid
as a marksman. Autumn is the sea
son of husking bees and red ears and
the aftermath of summer's courting.
In the lovers' year book winter has
nothing to recommend it except the
mistletoe.
Yet winter carries with it the idea of
domesticity, hearth fires, long even
ings and tete-a-tetes in coay cor-
ners â of the charm of rosy cheeks and
eyes that sparkle, of light laughter
over frozen waters under moonlit skies.
'Tis the appropriate season for bach
elor dreams of the girls who said "No,"
and the girls who might have said
"Yes," had they had half a chance. It
is the time of year when love-lorn
maidens curl up comfortably in easy
chairs and munch chocolate bonbons
while they write to their sweethearts
hpw miserably lonely they are.
Winter is a match-maker after Its
own way. He is like one of those blus
tering old bachelors who look as if
their hearts were frozen, but who are
always taking the trouble to thraw eli
gible young people together.
To me winter is a time of dreaming.
But it is the outdoor "world that sets
my fancy to leaping over barriers of
fact," and not the fireside comer â par
haps because I cannot sit, manlike,
with my feet upon the fender and a
pipe between my fingers for good fel
lowship. Besides, I have a gas-log,
and therefore am not able, like Ike
Marvel, to moralize over visions awak
ened by a wood or coal fire. And here,
when evening falls, I can sit and
watch the misty winter landscape and
HERE IS A CITIZEN WHO IS EAGER
TO SEE THE CITY PROGRESS.
We Must Suppress Gambling and Prize Fighting, He Says,
Control Pacific Commerce, Have Lower Freight
Rates, and Advertise Our Glorious Climate.
To the Editor of the Callâ
We who reside in San Francisco
fail to Realize the many opportu
nities for the future development
of our city. If the same energy
used in developing Chicago were
used here, our city would have a popu
lation of one million people. When
gambling, lotteries, prize flouting and
like forces are the ruling power in a
community it retards progress. If the
same amount of money absorbed by
this element was put into homes, real
estate, and other channels of circula
tion it would enrich the city from three
to five hundred thousand dollars a
month. The young mind which is at
tracted to gambling, drinking and the
like, soon loses interest in the com
mercial welfare of the city. We gaze
upon the monster absorbing the mind
and vitality of our young men and
women, and offer slight resistance.
The worst element of other large cities
realizing that our city is headquarters
for gamblers, thugs, etc., consequently
are flocking here from Chicago, St.
Louis and other points. We will come
to our senses after several murders and
burglaries have been committed.
Plans for the future should be our
v.atchward. The Panama Canal will
be completed in a few years. It means
much to us and in the meantime we
should take advantage of present op
portunities. This should be head
quarters for the manufacture and sale
of all undeveloped products of our
Pacific possessions. If we do not plan
accordingly. New York and Chicago
will seek to control the same upon com
pletion of the canal. If the head
quarters are here and business estab
lished before that time we shall control
the commerce of our Pacific posses
sions. It means millions to our city.
Our Legislature does very little for
the city or State. If it had our
interests at heart it would study the
needs of the State and pass laws ac
cordingly. An Eastern or -home in
vestor is reluctant to invest in assess
able stocks. If our laws allowed us to
incorporate and issue full paid and
ron-assessable stock we would be head
quarters for mining and industrial
r ( mpanies for the Western States and
Pacific possessions. It means more
offices and higher rent, more employ
ment for skilled labor and millions of
A TOUCHING APPEAL.
Beggarâ Kind lady, won't you help a
poor man wots out at de knees?
Kind Lady â How came you to be out
at the knees?
Beggar â Whyâ erâ Â«râ prayin* fer
work, ma'am
listen to the passion of the night wind.
The night windâ have you ever
thought how like it is to human pas
sion? Such power it has to taunt, to
scourge, to cleanse, to carry with it
the force of its own purpose.
Winter is full of romance. It is full
of castles in the air. It is the home
time of the year. And it offers oppor
tunities for youths and maids to learn
to love each other in a wholesome way.
Eastern capital invested in our city and
territory. Mines, fruit farms, ranches.
etc., could be incorporated and stock
sold in the East with headquarters
here. Do we grasp the situation? The
innocent and wise prefer to buy full
paid and non-assessable stock.- *â¢ It i 3
easier to sell. Less chance for dis
pute. Tonopah and Goldfleld are in
- their infancy. - Those mining iM^mpftniP. 1 * â 
should " incorporate, with, offices and
headquarters here. Our papers report
8000 each from Chicago and St. Louis
leave for Nevada in a few days. Why
not draw -most of them to our city?
Most of these will be supplied with
considerable money.
No city can build up a profitable in
land commerce with high freight rates.
The idea of taxing a commodity for all
it will stand should cease. They say
the freight on lumber from Portland.
Oregon, to Los Angeles is the same as
Northern California points. Why sacri
fice our industries to benefit other
States? We are now and have been
absorbed by the railroad octopus.
Packing (beef and pork) and manufac
turing industries should be encouraged.
Redwood coffins if only advertised
should prove rapid sellers. A coffin
that never rots should sell like hot
cakes. If our city and State would use
some of the money (diverted to th-Â±
boodlers' pockets) Into advertising her
many resources, outside capital would
develop our undeveloped resources. .
Most Easterners who winter in Cali
fornia are strong and healthy, conse
quently our climate should draw them
if advertised like Southern California.
Any climate within , a radius of 100
miles of San Francisco is applicable to
weak or strong. A new city of 100,000
near the bay for health seekers would
spring up In a few years if properly
advertised. Our . summer winds and
winter fogs are unfavorable for ex
treme cases of consumption and such
like, but a few miles "from the bay are
equal .to the climate so much adver
tised by the southern part of the State.
A united press Is what our city needs.
We may criticize Chicago's windy
press, nevertheless it has made Chicago
what it now is. Chicago is the nucleus
of the central States. San Francisco
should be likewise of the Pacific States.
Break up the large ranches so our c[ty
can supply 5.000.000 people. , We have
sufficient room for this number and it
can be brought about by making the
average price 7 per acre so low as to
Induce all classes to buy. Some people
think but never act. Let those who
lead this both think and act. .

SENATOR WOLFE.
OPPONENTS OF RIGHTS
BILL ARE MARKED MEN
Suffragists Bob Up Smiling
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
"Senator 'Eddie* Wolfe for Mayor of
San Francisco ?*â¢ Well, hardly!
Not if SOOO clubwomen know it,"
Fay the leaders of the suffrage bill â
the bill that lacked two votes from go
ins before the Governor. And it is i
said by those who are in position to
â¢know that Governor Pardee would j
have affixed his signature had it
reached â and blessings on him for
his good intentions!
But to hark back to the little man j
Â« ho says he wants to be Mayor of
Kan Francisco â Senator "Eddie"
\\ olfe, who led the opposition to the I
Lnl for "equal rights." The women :
â who listened to the debate in Sacra- â¢
niento have returned, bringing with ;
them some interesting opinions of I
LoriaJ intelligence.
Say the leaders for equal rights: '
*"\Ye would not oppose Senator Wolfe
simply because he was against our
bill; but because he made such fool
tiiitements about women and opposed '
the- bill from inherent prejudice, re- I
fusing to argue on the basis of justice,
sweeping aside the Ipgical statements
of Senator Charles'*Shortridge and
other intelligent men who compose
the Senate.
And somehow or other, say the
women, the imbecilic speech of Wolfe
that he "opposed the Ml] because the
men he knew didn't want to vote,"
really appealed to a lot of his col
leagues whose minds were of the
AVolfe texture.
"Who, pray." says the women, "au- i
thorized the Senator from San Fran- .
cisco to say what the women of Cali
fornia want? â for, judging from his
speech, his acquaintance among intel
ligent women is somewhat limited. At I
his hand lay a memorial petitioning I
for equal rights, signed by the most
intelligent and cultivated women in
California. But what of this when
(placed side by side with the women
of his acquaintance, 1 who didn't want
to vote?"
And this is the logic of men! For |
a man who bears the earmarks of j
sanity and intelligence and whose
other utterances at Sacramento were I
fairly logical and progressive. Senator
Wolfe has made a dunce of himself j
foi- keeps. 'â¢
No one paid heed to the ignoramuses j
â or is it ignorami?â from away back
who talked against the measure on
the ground that men would find them- j
selves minding the babies while the |
women "did politics." Nobody took'
them seriously. The surprise came
when an intelligent man took that
stand.
But now that it's all over and done â ;
and Senator Shortridge goes on rec
ord as making the most logical and
comprehensive talk of the session,
there is this to be said: That the most
progressive and the most Intelligent j
Tnepibers of both houses were in favor .>
of the measure, realizing the justice of 1
the claim that "taxation without rep
resentation" is manifestly unfair, and
that sex is not a logical bar to the
rights of citizenship.
However, there's another Legislature
to meet two years from now, and the
education for justice will go on. So
cheer up, ladies, cheer up!
But meanwhile Senator "Eddie" ,
Wolfe will not be Mayou of San Fran
cisco If Â£000 clubwomen can help it.
And not because he helped defeat this
bill, but because he showed himself ,
illogical, prejudiced and incapable of
adjusting his mental focus upon new
views. So there!

There fa a steady tendency toward
activity in the home, which assumes
a form of pleasure superseding all
others. The mad, merry whirl is over
and will not be revived until after
Lent, and then it will be only a short
time before the country pastimes be
gin. There are not many engagements
to report, although the little god of
love has not been altogether amiss and
has managed to redeem himself.
A dance or two and an occasional
visitor from the East or abroad to en

week in social circles.

BARXIM & BAILEY
COMING TO THE COAST
For the First Time in More Than
Forty Years the Show Will Be
Brought to California.
NEW YORK, Feb. 26. â For the first
time in more than forty years Barnum
& Bailey's show will go to California
this summer. Nearly all the countries
of Europe have been visited, but the
show has usually confined its initin
erary to section east of the Rocky
Mountains in this country.
European medical experts have come
to the conclusion that boiled milk is not
a good food for infants, and that ster
ilized milk also has less nutritive value
than that which is fresh.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
Dyspepsia of Women
ABSOLUTELY NEEDLESS AGONY
Caned by Uterine Disorders and Cored by
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Comptund
A great many women suffer with s
form of indigestion or dyspepsia which
does not seem to yield to ordinary treat-
ment. While the symptoms seem to be
similar to those of ordinary indiges-
tion, yet the medicines universally pre-
scribed do not seem to restore the pa-
tient's normal condition.
Mrs. Pink ham claims that there is a
kind of dyspepsia that is caused by a
derangement of the female organism,
and which, while It causes a disturb-
ance similar to ordinary indigestion,
cannot be relieved without a medicine
which not only acts as a stomach tonic,
but has peculiar uterine-tonic effects
also.
As proof of this theory we call at-
tention to the case of Mrs. Maggie
Wright, Brooklyn, N. V.. who was
completely cured by Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound after every-
thing else had failed. She writes :
" For two years I suffered with dvspepcia
which so degenerated my entire system that I
was unable to attend to my daily duties. I
felt weak and nervous, and nothing that I atÂ«
tasted good and it caused a disturbance in my
stomach. I tried different dyspepsia cures,
but nothing seemed to help me. I was ad-
vised to give Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound a trial, and was happily surprised
to find that it acted like a fine tonic, and in a
few days I began.to enjoy and properly digest
my food. My recovery was rapid, ana in
five weeks I was a well woman. I have rec-
ommended it to many suffering women."
No other medicine in the world has
received such widespread and unquali-
fied endorsement, or has such a record of
cures of female troubles, as has Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.

cable message from Dublin yesterday
announcing the death of the Rev.
Father Patrick Hennessey, former as
sistant rector of St. Paul's Church,
Twenty-ninth and Church streets, of
which the Rev. Father Connolly is
rector.
Father Hennessey had long been
ailing, and it was in the hope of be
ing restored to health that he left
San Francisco for Ireland eight
months ago. His condition was such
as to give great anxiety to his rela
tives and friends, but withal he never
complained.
Father Hennessey was born in
Aherlow, County Tipperary, thirty
three years ago, and was educated at
St. Patrick's Seminary, Thurles. After
his ordination by the late Archbishop
Croke of Cashel, June 19, 1898, he
came to San Francisco and soon
won the esteem 'of the parishioners
with whom he labored until the day
he left for the old land, broken in
health but buoyant in spirit and hope.
When the sad news was commu
nicated to the Rev. Father Connolly
yesterday morning the order was given
to toll the bells of the church, and in
a short while the tidings spread
throughout the parish. There will be
a solemn requiem mass at St. Paul's
for the departed on Wednesday morn
ing a,t 10 o'clock.
Father Hennessey is survived by his
father and a brother, William, who
live in Ireland, and two brothers, Mi
chael and James Hennessey, residents
of San Francisco. The interment will
take place in Ireland.

TO BUILD
CANAL AT
SEA LEVEL
Engineering Board Draws
Up Plans for Construction
of Isthmian Waterway on
the Most Elaborate Scale
AMEEICAN METHODS
WILL REDUCE COST
Figures Show Work Can Be
Completed in Ten or Dozen
Years for Two Hundred
and Thirty Million Dollars
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26.â The first
definite engineering plans for the con
struction of the Panama canal have
Just been laid before the Isthmian
Canal Commission by the engineering
committee of that body, consisting of
Commissioners Burr, Parsons and
Davis. The principal recommendations
are summed up in this resolution:
Resolved. That this committee approve and
recommend for adoption by the commission a
plan for a sea level canal, with a bottom width
of 130 feet and a minimum depth of water
of thirty-five feet and with twin tidal locks
at Miraflores, whose usable dimensions shall
be 1000 feet long and 100 feet wide, at a
total estimated cost of $230,500,000. Such es
timates Include an allowance for administra
tion, engineering, sanitation and contingencies,
amounting to 938.450.000. bat without allow
ace for interest during construction, expense
of cone government and collateral coats and
water supply, sewers or paving of Panama or
Colon, which last lt*ms are to be repaid by
tho Inhabitants of those cities.
The committee estimates that a sea
level canal can be completed within ten
or twelve years from the present time.
These recommendations are tile con
clusion of a report of the committee
prepared in the canal zone under date
of February 14, and based on complete
engineering reports on all of the prob
lems Involved.
The committee decided that under no
circumstances should the surface of the
canal be more than sixty feet above
the sea, and estimates that at this level
the cost would be $178,013,406. A thirty
foot level is estimated to cost $194,
213,406.
WORK AT LESS EXPENSE.
It Is recommended that the Chagres
River be controlled by a dam at Gam
boa, built to a crest height of 200 feet
and the waters of the lake thus cre
ated disposed of through tunnels. The
work on the dam will require from one
to two and a half years and the com
mittee reports it should begin at once.
The dam at this place, it is said, in
volves no formidable obstacle, which is
not the case at the Bohio location.
Actual work wkh the new American
steam shovels in the Cuiebra cut has
demonstrated that the entire excava
tion can be done at a cost of fifty cents
a cubic yard. The former Isthmian
committee estimated this cost at eighty
cents. This reduction amounts to a
total of $15,000,000 and is griven aa a
justification of the recommendation of
the sea-level canal.
Immediate work is recommended at
Colon in constructing a safe harbor.
To this end an outer breakwater is sug
gested as well as the construction of an
inner harbor at the entrance to the
canal. It is recommended that bids
be Invited for this work. Other minor
features of canal construction recom
mended include completing: the Galun
cillo diversion channel begun by the old
canal comjjsrfiy to divert from the canal
the waters of the Galuncillo and Mlndi
rivers and other smaller streams. In
connection with this three small dams
must be built, two across the Chagres
near the Mmdi and one across the Boca
Mindi. All of this work is independent
cf the decision as to the level for the
canal and its Immediate execution Is
recommended.
ITS MANY ADVANTAGES.
The committee makes this observa
tion In summing up:
The practicability of certainly and satisfac
torily controlling the floods of the Chagres by
so simple and economical a method as the
Gamboa Lake and its outflow channels and
the reduced cost of excavation as actually
demonstrated by the work of the Culebra cut
make thÂ» work of the sea level canal at a
reasonable cost far more available than has
heretofore appeared possible. These recent de
velopments In the conditions attending thÂ«
construction of the canal are so Important as
to be almost controlling In character.
The advantages of a sea level canal across
the Isthmus are most obvious. It would be a
waterway with no restriction to navigation and
ocft which could easily be enlarged by widen
ing or deepening at any time In the future,
to accommodate an Increased traffic, without
any inconvenience to the shipping using It;
whereas, a lock canal Is In reality a permanent
restriction to tho volume of truffle and slae of
ships that use It.
â The additional cost of a sea lÂ«vÂ«! canal over
that of a canal with locks with a summit
level of 60 feet above mean tide, is J32.462,0C0
and $79,742,000 more than the estimated cost
of the lock canal with a summit level 85 feet
.ibove mean tide, proposed by the former
Isthmian Canal Commission, after allowing
$6,500,000 for the Colon breakwater and <!1
rect entrance not previously estimated. Thla
committee considers this additional expendi
ture fully Justified by the advantages secured.
Discontent on Isthmus.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 28. â Writing
on the general topic of wages and the
discontent of employes on the
isthmus. General Davis, Governor
of the Panama canal zone, has
addressd a long communication
to the Panama Canal Commission.
His observations are confined to em
ployes of the commission on the isth
mus, who were hired in the United
States. Discussing the yellow fever
situation General Da\'is says:
Of canal employes and their families cominjr
here from the United States only four out of
some 400 or 500 have been sick from yellow
fever, and of this number one case terminated
fatally.
Discussing the lack of accommoda
tion the Governor observes:
The number of employes who have arrived
on the isthmus under appointments made In
the United States who assert that they were
told by members of the commission or by the
employes In Washington that they all would
have quarters or residences and excellent ac
commodations are so large and the assertions
are so positive that I cannot but believe there
is some basis for the statements made, and if
any such assurances were given it was a great
mistake, I think. The picture ought to have
been painted worse than It is rather than
otherwise, so that the men arriving here could
not possibly find the real condition to be worse
than they expected to find It.
As land can be secured in the way provided
by treaty and by statute. It will be taken and
there will be no delay In erecting the neces
sary houses for all the employes in the city
of Panama.
Until quarters are available, he says,
it is not advisable for married men
to take their families to Panama.
Misery for all concerned has resulted
j in cases where this has been done.
Governor Davis says the wages
paid to the employes are ' in many
cases 25 per cent higher than they
were during the busiest period of the
French canal work, and in no case are
they less.
No suggested remedy for the lack of
amusement is made. The barrooms
and gambling hells are the principal
attractions now, and in the city of
Panama lottery tickets are everywhere

BOY ENDS LIFE;
GIRL FORGETS
Edward 3liller Inhales Gas
and Woman Who Said She
Loved Him Only Smiles
Edward Miller, a vaudeville aoton,
ended his life yesterday by inhaling
gas. When told that he was dead Mlsa
Eva May Van DrufC, who four days
ago wrote him a passionately endear
ing letter, smiled and said. "I only
knew him slightly about a year aso."
By the dead boy's tide were founi
letters In which Miss Van DruXt iwore
that ahÂ« could not live without him
and that she would kill any wom*a
who should ever come between them.
Her letters are fuU of the hysterical
endearment* that certain women la
love scrawl over double sheet* of
paper. Yet last night Miss Van Draff
declared that she had only seen Mllie*
oneÂ©, a year ago, and had only writ
ten to him twice, and these on tart
ness.
She said this In a quiet, unconcerned
way. There was not a tear in her eye,
her cheeks retained their color and he*
lips parted in a smile.
Two weeks ago she wrote to him.
"Dearest, you are all my happiness la
this world." Yesterday she repudiated
the dead boy.
Miller met his death in a room at 118
Sixth street. He rented the apartment
on Saturday night. Yesterday after
noon a Japanese boy employed at the
place noticed a strong smell of gas.
The odor was traced to Miller's room.
When the door was broken down
Miller was found dead. He had
plugged all the crevices in the doors
and windows to make lure of death.
Clutched in hi 9 hand was a medallion
picture of Jean Melville, a vaudeville
actress with whom he had once "done
a turn"' in New York. There were no
letters to show in what way this wo
man was connected with Miller's death.
What made him tired of life at 22
cannot be fathomed. It is thought that
he committed suicide because he was
out of work and despondent. Miss Van
Druff says she does not know why he
sought death. She knows very little
about him she says. The letters thac
passed between them were purely busi
ness letters. Here is a sample of one
of the "business letters":
\Ly dearest SiddiA. I iust rmmd. your dear
kind letter, and dearest, you must hayÂ»
knswn how happy I was to hear frum you, my
dear boy. and to know that you are well.
Dearest, I am sorry to hear that you did not
get the position you expected.
But. dearest, do not let that worry you.
You are capable of filling any position you
care to take. Well, dearest, it seems a year
since I saw my iittl* boy. You see, sweet
heart, you belong to me and you are so much
smaller than me that I call you my little boy.
Dear, I read a nice long letter from pap* to
day and he says that when we are married
he can come and live with us.
Oh, E^dle. I hope you will flr.d a good posi
tion so' that I will not have to wait so very
long to have you by me. as dearest you know
you are all my happiness In this world.
Eddie. I am so lonesome without you and
you cannot realize how dearly I would love
to do with you, as you said I would be. When
I am with you life Beems a dream. When
you leave me I am back among such, common
people and I don t belong anywhere but witA
you. Oh. Eddie. [ don't know what I would
do if you let any one take you from m*.
Mr. Musta called at the house. He loves the
ground I walk on. I fear that man. Lester
said that If you were here hÂ« would hay*
Eddie help him kill Musta.
Mamma was happy when I told her about
you. She says when I am married she will
take cere of my babies. I am the happiest
girl in the world. I hope you are as happy-
Then follow five postscripts, one of
which reads, "Mrs. Eva Miller see how
the name is going to look?"
There are several letters from Mlsfl
Van Druff to Arthur Currans about
"Eddie." She threatens t<> leave "thJa
cruel world if Eddie forsakes me."
Miss Van Druff held a consultation
with her family before 3he would grant
an Interview at her home at 318 Fell
street. When seen she was in the best
of spirits and smilingly denied that aha
knew Miller intimately. It is thought
that she heard of Jean Melville and
that jealousy hardened her.
Miller's parents live at J4OS Eigh
teenth street. His father is Henry H.
Miller, a sign painter. The young fel
low's parents say that he left home a
year ago and that they had seen littt*
of him since then.
Volunteer Firemen's Banquet.
The Veteran Volunteer FlrÂ«mÂ»n*a
Association assembled Saturday night
in a popular rotlsserie for the purpoa*
cf enjoying its annual banquet. Tnera
were present nearly one hundred of thÂ«
old "Vets" and a few specially invited
guests. Steve Bunner, the president of
the association, presided, and after thm
menu had been discussed and enjoyed
he designated William H. Miller thÂ«
first vice president as toast master.
Then followed aa hour of old time
songs and reminicent talks of the days
when the "boys ran mid de ole ma
sheen." The singers "were Gus Pohl
man, Felix Desmond, Jack Green, Jack
Cavanagh, Mr. Ryan nnd Steve Bun
ner. The speakers were Fred A. Will.
Daniel Sewell, Fire Commissioner Par
ry, Dr. J. H. Hubachek, J. Williams
and E. C. Stock: Toward the close of
the banquet a number of the ladles
who are members of the Ladies of the
Auxiliary of the association entered
the dining hall, were received with an
old-time welcome and were accorded
seats of honor at tbÂ« table. The affair
was one of the most pleasant the as
sociation has had in many years.
Like Lieutenant Ellis of the Rus
sian Baltic fleet, there are many de
scendants of Scottish or English fami
lies in the Russian service, but most
of them have Russianized their
names, as in the caa^ of the Hamilton,
whose name is now Humaroff.

and certainly .win exist â¢ for a lons ' time with,

FAIL TO CHARM
Majority of the City Play
ers Cross the Bay to
Witness Aiameda Matches
It was an off day yesterday at the
tennis courts. The weather was good, ;
but most of the players crossed the
bay, either to participate In or witness .
' the Alameda County championship
â¢ tournaments The courts here were by
no means deserted, but only practice
frames were indulged in and the con- '<
testants were for the most part lower
class players.
On the California Club courts one 'â 
continuous tournament match was .
rÂ»la. j-r-ri â  . rÂ»r iÂ«Â»voer>"Â»Â»rÂ» â and â TV G. 1
Knowlton, two of the best men in the :
third class, met for the third time.
Victory once more went to Knowlton.
On the occasion of their first meeting:
Lovegrove won by â¢> small margin.
When they met for the second time
Knowltoii carried off the honors, but !
had nothing to spare. The third and i
deciding match was also close. All
three sets played were 6-4. Knowlton
took the first and third, while Love
grove had to be content with second.
Knowlton, who has come up from
near the bottom of the fourth class,
now occupies third position in the third
class. Dr. Lovegrove is by no means
discouraged and if possible will take
Knowlton on again next Sunday.
Besides beating Dr. Lovegrove
Knowlton had the distinction of hay- j
ing participated in half the matches
played on the California Club courts. ;
He lost three sets to C. G. Kuehn and
two to B. F. Hoarse. With a handi- |
cap of "15 3-6" he played a tie with
Harold Gabriel, each winning a set.
Kuehn caused quite a surprise by :
beating Knowlton decisively. The lat- j
ter took only four games in three sets.
\V. S. MacGavJn and Dr. Younger
played a one-set match. As usual
Mac-Gavin won, the score being 6-4. He
ecems able to outplay the doctor for
one set, but would stand little show
in a longer match.
George Cutter won four straight sets
from : Moulten Warner. H. Schmidt
and Cutter and Paul Jones and War

of the day. The former won two
straight sets. The scores follow:

SENSATIONAL PLAY WITNESSED
ON THE CAROLAN FIELD.
AN EXTRA PERIOD IS REQUIRED
TO DECIDE THE WINNING TEAM
CONDITIONS AID
THE MARKSMEN
After a Foggy Morning the
Sky Clears and Good
Results Are Obtained
The crack of the rifle was incessant
yesterday at Shell Mound Park. Dur
ing the early hours the fog interfered
somewhat with the marksmen, who
were eager to place center shots, but
as noon approached the sky cleared
and the afternoon was an ideal one for
rifle shooting.
William Dressier of the Redmen's
Schuetzen shot in good form. He
captured the champion class medal,
made the best first shot of the day
and carried off Captain L. Siebe's
medal for making the best center in
the bullseye target. The best bullseye
of the day was made by Otto Bremer
in the Germania Schuetzen Club, who
scored the excellent record of 88
points. At first it was thought this
shot was a true center, but the test
of the measuring machine gave it the
true location.
In the competition shoot ofÂ«the San
Francisco Schuetzen Verein Captain
H. Stelling made the good score of 73
rings out of a possible 75, placing him
high man for the day. He was close
ly pressed by Fred Brandt, who made
72 and 71. In the same club G. H.
Bahrs carried off the honors for first
bullseye with 410 points.
The veterans of the National Guard
made an excellent showing with the
old Springfield rifle at the Blunt tar
get. More than one half of the mem
bers who participated scored 80 per
cent or more, an evidence that a little
more practice will bring them back
to the old form. Otto Nolte and Cap
tain J. E. Klein of the vets, two well
known riflemen, held a private match
and each scored 23 points out of a
possible 25 at 200 yards.
Martin F. Blasse, in the Golden Gate
Club competition, made the excellent
score of 229 rings in ten shots, being
an average of almost 23 out of a pos
sible 25. He also scored the most
flags of the day for center shots.

Company H Victorious.
The football team representing
Company H, League of the Cross
Cadets, triumphed over the fast
Brooklyn eleven yesterday afternoon
at the Presidio grounds. The victors
now claim the championship of the
league. The features of the game were
the fifteen-yard run for a touchdown
by Garibaldi and the two touchdowns
by Syce, both of Company H. Heine
Heitmuller, the noted Berkeley foot
ball and baseball player, refereed the
game, which was viewed by a large
crowd.
FOTJO PLATER WHO WAS PROMI
NENT AT BTiKL-INQAME. AND
AN INCIDKNT OF THE MATCH.
Six goals to five in favor of the Brit
ish horsemen was the result of the
great polo match yesterday on Francis
J. Carolan's private field at Burlin
game. The game was between English
and American-born players respective
ly, and so evenly were they matched
that an extra period of play was nec
essary to decide it. It was a brilliant
game and intensely exciting. With
the honor of their respective countries
at stake, four handsome gold match
boxes, presented by Mrs. Charles W.
Clark, a gift from herself, many pri
vate wagers to be settled and a gal
lery of half a thousand people looking
on and cheering, there were unusual
exhibitions of daring on the part of
the players and all the mettle that was
in them was put into play.
The Englishmen led off with a goal
in the first period, scored by Menzies.
This was soon offset with one by Wal
ter Hobart. In the second period
neither side scored. Prescott gave the
visitors two more in the third and De
Crespigny raised it one in the fourth.
In this period Mackey scored one for
the Americans, so that the fifth period
opened with the score 4 to 2 in favor
of Great Britain. Menzies soon in
creased it to five and Burlingame bÂ«
gan to despair. Walter Hobart then
came to the rescue and with three
brilliant goals in successsion and
amidst the wildest applause concluded
the period with a tie.
The last of these was a magnificent
play, in which he lifted the ball far
above the heads of his opponents in
front of him and goaled it at forty
yards distance. The sixth period was
full of exciting play, but neither side
could score and the tie remained un
broken. Another period was ordered
and th? foreigners finally scored. De
Crespigny was the successful one, and
the play ceased. The sides:
English (reds)â Sir George Prescott,
F. C. G. Menzies, Captain C. de Cres
pigny and John Lawson.
American (white)â F. J. Carolan, F.
J. Mackey. Walter S. Hobart and Law
rence McCreery.
Umpires â R. M. Tobin and J. O. To
bin Jr.: referee, Cyril Tobin; timekeep

The great International match be
tween the Hurlingham and Burlingame
teams will be played next Sunday with
a different alignment.
LICK NINE OUTPLAYS
THE BELMOXT TOSSERS
For the First Time in Three Years
the "Prep" Team Is Beaten by
the High School.
For the first time in three years the
Lick baseball team triumphed over the
fast aggregation representing Belmont
School. The game took place on the
campus of the latter school Saturday
afternoon and the Lick boys simply
waded in from the call of time and
won out by a score of 9 to 7.
Both teams played a good, steady
game, considering the earliness of the
season. Lick won through the steady
box work of Captain White. Sherman,
for Belmont, had splendid control, but
the Lick lads got to him a couple of
times and scored runs enough to carry
them through safely. The teams
lined up as follows:
Lick. Positions. Belmont.

Association Football Eleven
at Idora Park, Oakland
The Oakland Hornets beat the Al
bion Rovers 3 goals to 1 in a lively and
interesting game for the championship
of the California Association Fc/otball
League yesterday at Idora Park. Ow
ing to the lateness of some of the Hor
nets the ball was not kicked off till
3:45 p. m.. and interruptions caused by
the airship "California Messenger,"
which invaded the football grounds
several times, caused the match to be
prolonged till 5:30 p. m.
After some twenty minutes of play
McKonzie made a good l r ck and scored
the first goal for the Hornets. J. Smith
kicked the second goal and before half
time made another fine shot, but it
struck the bar and bounded back. R.
Disher secured possession of the ball
and put it into the net. Before half
time the Rovers scored one goal, mak
ing the score: Hornets. 3 goals; Ro
vers, 1 goal. Though there was plenty
of fast play in the second half, neither
side scored. The Albion Rcrvers made
some good attempts to score, but could
not quite get the ball into the net. The
teams lined up as follows:

BATTLING NELSON PERFORMS
BEFORE AN ADMIRING THRONG
Corbett Puts the Finishing Touches on
His Condition on the Road.
The training quarters of youn* Cor
bett at Billy Shannon's villa near San
Rafael, and those of Battling Nelson's
at Metzner's Tavern, Larkspur, were
crowded yesterday with friends of
the boxers. Many sportinjc men jour
neyed to the Marin County resorts to
get a line on the form displayed by
the boys before wagering their money.
Both Corbett and Nelson are still
overweight, but the problem of makins
130 pounds at 6 o'clock to-morrow night
is not worrying them.
Corbett claims he could have been
at weight last night, but he prefers to
wait until to-morrow before touchine
the beam at 130. Yesterday afternoon
he weighed 132 pounds. Nelson, after
his day's work, was said to weigh 132
pounds by his handlers. The trainer
anticipates no trouble in making the
required weight, as he has not vet com
menced to dry out. By this process a
pound or more can be readily disposed
of in a day.
Corbett was the center of attraction
at Shannon's villa. Joe Gans and
Frank McDonald came in for their
share, but the little Denverlte received
much attention. Many visitors grasD
ed his hand during the day and wished
him good luck In his coming battle.
The majority of visitors desired to
see him work in the gymnasium, but
Frank McDonald would not agree to
the proposition..
Corbett hit the road in the morning
with Joe Gans, and the pair went over
their usual route in fifty-nine minutes.
The journey usually takes an hour and
a quarter and when the boys ran into
camp fifteen minutes earlier than usual
Frank McDonald was taken by sur
prise. He had to hustle to prepare the
rubbing room. While Corbett was be
ing rubbed Gans remarked: "I never
saw a fighter with a better wind.

COMEDIAN DAILY LOSES
COIN AXD TRAIN TICKETS
CLEVELAND, Feb. 26. â "I never
was touched in New York, Chicago.
Philadelphia or any of the larger hay
stacks, but over here in the long grass
the job was done," said Pete Daily,
the comedian, to-day.
The cause of his lament was that he
had lost $400 and his railroad tickets
for himself and his eight "Lulu" girls
from Cleveland to Philadelphia. Daily
believes he was robbed after his per
formance at the local theater last
night.
That kid hasn't taken a long breath
since we left."
During the afternoon Corbett took a
short walk. The weather was ex
tremely warm and he returned perspir
ing freely.
Corbett will follow the same pro
gramme to-day, running in the morn
ing and napping in the afternoon.
Frank McDonald, Joe Gans, Tim Mc-
Grath and Spider Kelly will be in Cor
bett's corner to-morrow night. Corbett
is as fit as a fiddle and looks the pic
ture of health. He has learned much
from Gans during the champions stay
at San Rafael, and he hopes to put his
newly gained knowledge into practice
on the night of the battle. He freely
acknowledges his Indebtedness to thÂ«
Baltimore wonder and if he wins will
owe much to him.
The largest crowd that has ever vis
ited Larkspur crowded Metaner's Tav
ern to get a glimpse of the Battling
Dane. Long before 3 p. m., the time
set for him to work, rafter room
at a premium. The hot sun beat on
the roof of the gymnasium, making it
extremely warm. Bat still continued
his regular exercise and boxing. Alto
gether ahout three-quarters of an hour
was spent in the gymnasium and whea
Bat reached his dressing-room he was
bathed in perspiration.
The boxing with Fred Landers great
ly pleased the spectators and Bat re
ceived frequent applause. He received
a cut on the face during the bout.
During the morning Bat took a run
of eight miles, ai-companied by Billy
Nolan and Bill Benner.
A short run will be taken this morn
ing and a few minutes will be spent
in the gymnasium :n the afternoon.

FACTIONS FIGHT
OVER POSITION
Lee Family Split Over the
Selection of Secretary to
Chinese Six Companies
The annual meeting of the Chinese
Six Companies for the purpose of elect-
Ing a secretary was held in the com
pany's headquarters on Commercial
street on Saturday night, and was of
such a disorderly character that the
police had to raid the place and make
several arrests.
The position of secretary rotates from
family to family, and this year the
selection was to be made from the Lee
family There are two factions in this
family, one composed of merchants and
the other of highbinders. Each faction
has a candidate for the office. Lee
Wai Do was the choice of the mer
chants, Lee Ling of the highbinders.
The highbinder? armed themselves
vith clubs, brass knuckles and pieces
of iron pipe and determined to have
thfir man elected by force if necessary.
When the meeting was called to order
a merchant rose and nominated Lee [
Wai Do. That was the signal for an
onslaught by the highbinders. Chairs
and tables were overturned and broken
and several of the merchants were
badly beaten, and one's ribs were
broken.
Word was sent to Sergeant Cook of
the Chinatown squad and he quickly
collected his men and raided the plate.
When they got there" heaps of Chinese
were struggling on the floor. The ap
pearance of the police had an instant
effect in Quelling the disturbance. I
Six of the highbinders were arrested
for disturbing the peace and one for
assault with a deadly weapon. Four
were found in the place and the other
three were arrested later. They were
said to be the ringleaders of the high
binder faction.

The patrolmen started in pursuit
and Kramer fired a shot in the air to
intimidate them, but it made the men

"TROLLEY CARS OR ANTIQUATED CABLE?"
ASKS THE UNITED RAILROADS
THREATENS ITS PASSENGERS WITH , '
POOR SERVICE ON SUTTER STREET
THE United Bailroads is insisting that the Sutter-street Railroad system oannot be successfully
converted into a conduit elcotrio line. The corporation wants to string trolley wires along
Sutter, Larkin and Post streets and on Pacific avenue.
The Sutter-street Improvement Club and property- owners have expressed themselves
against overhead wires, but the railroad threatens to maintain the antiquated cable system un
less the mandate of its officers is obeyed Arguments are advanoed by the improvement olub
to show that the corporation's statements that conduit line 3 are a failure are not well grounded.
This is pn age of progress, not of
retrogression. Electricity has besun
to supplant steam, and the under
ground electric car system is replacing
the antiquated trolley.
This the argument, in a nutshell, of
the Butter Street Improvement Club.
The club wants the underground road,
the United Railroads wants the cheaD
er but rapidly degenerating: trolley
line. The Supervisors have the fate of
the trolley in the balance and if they
weigh the question well they will find
the system wanting. The passing: of
the trolley is sure to come in the near
future, and it wiU not be more essen
tial to the maintenance of an electric
line than a stretch of copper wire is
necessary to the good work of Mar
coni's system.
The United Railroads proposes to
convert the Sutler street cable-car
system into an overhead trolley road.
The engineers of the company profess
to have made a close study of the mat
ter and have come to the conclusion
that the corporation would have to
spend $200,000 in constructing: drains
for the conduits, should the under
ground wire idea be carried out. Their
proposal is now in the hands of the
Street Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors and as an off-set to it is a
long protest from the Sutter Street Im
provement Club which sets forth that
in New York and Chicago and certain
cities of Europe the underground sys
tem has been operated not only to the
advantage to .the public, but to the
financial benefit of the promoters.
SOME REASONS WHY.
Several reasons are given by the im
| provement club for desiring the con
duit system, viz.:
Trolley ivhe systems must be done away
with Hi all l>rse cities in ' the near future, as
the wires are dangerous in event of fires.
Kle<trkians are constantly improving under-
Kround system* for placing of all manner of
wire*. Poles of all descriptions will soon be
eliminated from public streets.
In the sections traversed by the Sutter-street
line there are many homes that property own
. ers have endeavored to 'beautify at a large
1 outlay o( time and â¢' money. ; The '. Poik-street
â¢ section of J the Sutter-street Jine Is i the !, main
! line traversing: the, beautiful Pacific - Height*
I district and the Vresltllo-avenue section. Cross
1 ing these streets are â â -, many ;" thoroughfares
( - where have been 'erected ' homes,, small and
â¢ large, that in the aggregate . form one of the
1 prettiest parts of San Francisco. The sections
mentioned . are already encumbered *. with .'. un
sightly wires and poles. .The , erection. of trol
ley wire poles and the homely 'feeders and
main . wires would - add : to : the ' ugliness . of â ' the
blotÂ» , on v what wnuld â¢ otherwise be beautiful
avenue*. 'â¢'â -â¢' .-.'"' =- ; â 'â "\ '.'.*â â .";'â "'â . â Â';.: ;:â '- :I. : .
j That in Eastern cities the underground sys
! tern of electric car wires has beÂ«n a success.
The same protest was ' made '. In New ; York by
the railroad people against putting their, wires
underground as Is now - being - made :by "j the
United Railroads In San â  Francisco. When . the
city officers of . Gotham ; investigated ": the cor-.
, poration protests they found "â¢ that .the only
valid reason that the corporation could ' give
! for favoring the overhead .wires was' that the
j underground system cost a great deal of mon
ey. Under cross-examination It "was admitted
. that when once bul'.t the 'line would more
substantial,, easier 'to -maintain and conse
quently-less extensive. * â  . â  ' :.v"
Chicago's underground system proved a suc
cess from the start, and Â»in Washington: the
, roads have been a . great â  relief -. from - the un
i gainly .overhead wire*. 'A " â  "*\ * '. '; '
QUESTION OF EXPENSE.
The United Railroads has a matter
of $200,000 of expense for drainage of
ci.nduits standing between a decision in
f.ivor of the underground system. In
the corporation's answer to the prop
erty owners along the lines of the
Sutter.-street system it also offers other
reasons for not wanting to construct a
mnduit road, but the $200,000 is really
the somber figure in the case.
The railroad somewhat involves it
self when it says: "The inferiority of
the cable is noticeable. What is wanted
is a faster service and the railroad
leans toward electricity."
The railroad officials admit that they
are not giving the people of the West
ern Addition a proper service. They
admit that the cars are overcrowded,
out of date, uncomfortable and slow,
yet they practically say that if they
cannot have their own way in dealing
with the public they won't do anything
in the matter and the public can get
along the best it can.
In an inspired circular the United
Railroads' idea is advanced as follows:
It is to be hoped that no unreasoning prej
udice will compel the railroad company to
continue the obsolete cable traction plant on
Butter street and Its car branches. Should It
be so there will be no new through line from
down town to the beach without change of
cars, no Interchange of cam with those of the
el(K?tric lines of the city, no Increase In the
service of thÂ« Presidio and Pacific Heights dis
tricts, no benefit to property along the route
through which the cars run. Passengers will
be fqp-ced to continue to transfer at Polk and
Sutter streets, at Presidio avenue and other
points, and will have to rÂ«Â«t content with
crowded car*, and nubir.it to glow service.
On the other hand the adoption of the trol
ley system would Increase the speed and
double the service of the cars, would enable
passengers to continue In one car from Pacific
avenue and Polk street to Market street, to
make direct connections with other electric
lines, and to ride from town to the perk and
the beach without change. When one reflects
on the disadvantages of the cable system, the
Impracticability of the electric conduit and the
benefits which the electric trolley plant hofSs
out there should be only one sentiment in this
community and In the Board of Supervisors,
and that the reconstruction of the Butter
street lines as an overhead electric system.
A QUEER ARGUMENT.
This statement is both a threat to the
people of San Francisco and mislead
ing. In substance, the railroad declares
that if the people of this city do not
dc Just as It rules they should do, It
will saddle them witn a fly-blown
assortment, of cars dragging wearily
over the hills at the tail end of a stock
of "dummies-" that saw service under
Cagebolt, and don't even carry their
age well. A slow cable and tracks that
are lain In wavy lines from the ferry
depot to the cemeteries must suffice
a suffering public that has the temerity
to ask something in return for the
millions of dollars a year that San
Francisco contributes to the support of
the United Railroads' Eastern and
foreign stockholders.
Tlrey L. Ford, attorney for the
United Railroads, says:
The I'nlted Railroads are willing and ready
to commence work on the construction of the
Sutter-street system an soon as a permit Is
granted to build an overhead trolley. Cars
such as are run on the Ellis and Eddy street
lines would be substituted for the cable cars
now In use.
When the United Railroads people came to
San Francisco and invested their millions In
street railroads they did so at a time when
the roads were not In a very good condition
and were at a turning point when they â¢would
soon have to be remodeled. We have since
been under a great deal of expense for recon
struction.
The object of the company wu to be friend
ly with the people of San Francisco and con
sult them on all subjects concerning local pas
senger transportation. The company has
brought the matter of the Sutter-street ayÂ«
tern to the attention of the Board of Super
vigors and the people and we are ready to go
ahead with the work when we find that the
people want the overhead electric road.
None of the officials of the railroad
will admit that the underground ser
vices in Eastern cities has proved as
successful as the trolley, but they can
not cite any particular authority to
show that they are not. The company
still further argues:
First â The city is hilly, the sewers are in an
abominable state, and the franchise of the
Sutter-street system has lesa than twenty-flve
years to run. To this must be added the ad
tional objection to reconstruction of the Sutter
street road and Its branches as an underground
conduit line that it would be deprived of con
nection with the other electric lines, and one
of the advantages of electricity over the cable
would be sacrificed. It appears that the to
pography of San Francisco is such that during
storms large volumes of water are drained
into the low places and that the flat lying
sewers are unable to dispose of It. At the
same time water flows fram the adjoining hills
into the cable slot, and frequently, in addition
to the natural drainage, the back water from
sewers overflows into the conduit. The im
portance of this statement lies in the fact that
it Is Impossible to operate an underground
electric conduit under water or in a wet place.
. Second-? jtegardlesa of " the perfect a condition
of , the , v railway ;â * itself, travel >. would depend
during wet weather upon the condition of < the
sewers. â  and V, if they were ' Imperfect *. or inade

be .-> harrowing j and ? the t dolences of ; the â  people
of San Francisco would go up to heaven. Under
such conditions it is easy .to understand : that
the United Railroads would be culpable In
installing an underground electric ; system on
Sutter street and its connections. > The .com
pany has ; perforce to choose between the cable
and the overhead trolley. It will be one or the
other, . as ' public i sentiment - and the â , Board of

Francisco; . and /-especially .patrons ..' of v the

EASILY ANSWERED.
The experts that have been consulted
! b$ members of the Sutter Street Im
j piovement Club answer the first eon
! tc-ntion by calling attention to the fact
j that the underground systems of the
i hiastern cities are never put out of
commission by snow and ice. If the
mere presence of water in the conduit
_v. ould "ground" the feed wire then why
"do not the Eastern roads ground dur
ing the melting of the snow when the
volume of water that seta into the
conduit in level cities like Washington
and Chicago must be much greater
than it would be on a rainy day in hilly
San Francisco? If the conduits are
properly constructed the feed wire will
not rest on the bottom of the concrete
as the United Rai. roads' engineers ssem
to assume it will. They must figure on
a conduit of small diameter.
The second statement merely pictures
j the harrowing conditions that will con
! front Sutter street travelers if they
j fail to obey the harvesttr of the nickels.
Professor Franz Eberling, who sev
eral years ago visited this country from
Germany to make reports on American
street railroad systems, said in his re
port that "the underground electric
system has been tried and seems to
have proved highly satisfactory. Oniy
a few minor obstacles to its success re
main to be obliterated." Since this
statement by the professor the ob
stacles referred to have undoubtedly
been removed, as there has been con
siderable progress in the improvement
of the Washington and Chicago conduit
electric roads.
Printed petitions addressed to the
â¢United Railroads and artfully worded
to convey the idea that the signers
desire an overhead trolley system to re
place the present cable road, have been
circulated for several weeks along both
sides of Sutter street.
A man bearing several petitlonsAvith
biank spaces for signatures appeared
a few days ago at the rooms of the
Holluschickie Club at $52 Sutter street.
The petition reads as follows:
To the United Railroads of San Francisco â
Gentlemen: It being represented to the under
signed that your company proposes to recon
struct Its Sutter-street system and continue it
as a cable road, now, therefore, we, the under
signed, hereby declare our preference for an
overhead electric trolley line in place of cable,
and respectfully petition that said line be so
reconstructed.
As will be seen the paragraph was
so carefully worded that casual read
ing would not show the discrimination
between overhead and underground
construction. At a glance the paper
purports to be a petition to the United
Railroads to consider the installation
of an electric road in preference to
renovation of the cable line. This
would give the road an opportunity
to switch to the overhead line, pro
ducing a request signed by citizens on
Sutter street, many of whom might not
be aware of what they were signing.
SIGNERS DECEIVED.
One of the members of the Hollus
chickie Club is Pierce C. Moore, for
merly secretary and still a member of
the Sutter-street Improvement Club.
He was upstairs in the club at the time
the petitioner called. On coming down
stairs he was told of "a petition," and
upon the assurance that his signature
was needed signed it hurriedly. Several
other members did the same, and it
was not until the bearer of the petition
had departed that they discovered from
a duplicate how they had been misled.
Moore, with other members of the
Club, repudiates his signature.
Three different petitioners appeared
at intervals of a few days to Frank P.
AP V KRTISEMEXTS.
SALT RHEUM ON HANDS
Suffered Agony and Had to Wear
Bandages All the Time,
ANOTHER CURE BY CUTICURA
Another cure by Cuticura is told of
by Mr*. Caroline Cable, of Waupoca,
WiÂ»., in the following grateful let-
ter : "My husband suffered agony
with salt rheum on his hands,
and I had to keep them bandaged all
the time. We tried ercrything we
could get, but nothing helped him
until he used Cuticura. One set of
Cuticura Soap, Ointment, and Pills
cured him entirely, and his hands have
been as smooth as possible ever since.
I do hope this letter will be the means
of helping some other sufferer."
Shibeley, the florist, at 311 Sutter '
street. To Shibeley the first man who '
brought a petition acknowledges that :
he was from the United Railroads and
solicited the signature on the ground :
that the company could not afford to
put In the underground wire system, |
on account of the expense and the short
life remaining in the present franchise.
A few days later a second man ap- ;
peared with the same petition, contain- i
ing one or two signatures and asking !
again for Shibeley's autograph. The !
man denied emphatically that he was '
in thfc employ of the United Railroads
and said that he was working lnde- '
pendently, intimating that he thought
the best thing to be done by the Sut
ter-street residents was a compromise ;
with the company on the overhead wire ',
system. If this was not satisfactory '
to the citizens the man said that the
company might refuse to make any
change whatsoever.
After the failure of the two attempts !
to secure his signature Shibeley was |
surprised by a third man with a copy !
of the same p tition. This man is a |
resident of Geary street. Shibeley
pointedly asked him why he was cir- 1
culatlng a petition on a street that
was so far away from his interests.
The man evaded answer and departed !
without the coveted signature.
Shibeley is one of many Sutter- '
street merchants who holds out for
underground wires, and who thinks '
that the system of overhead wiring Is a
menace to the safety of traffic and a ;
mar to the beauty of any street. Sut- j
ter-street merchants have been fight
ing to have all overhead wires re
moved and it was only recently that
the telegraph and telephone wires on
the north side of the street were re
moved. To have the railroad com
pany place , overhead trolley wires
would undo the efforts of the people.
COXNETT'S LIFE LINE IS
GIVEN ANOTHER TRIAL.
IJope Reaches Top of Merchants* Ex
change Building in One Test
Out of Three.
John Connett's new life line, which
ht recently invented for the purpose
of shooting a line to the top of high
buildings in case of fire, was given its
second trial on the Merchants' Ex- j
change building yesterday morning.
More success was achieved with the
new apparatus than on the previous
trial, but it is still too uncertain a prop
osition for the Fire Department to j
adopt.
No excuses could be offered on ac- 'â¢
count of weather, as hardly a breath !
was blowing to mar the course of the
rope after it left the cannon. Three
attempts were made to send the rope
over the tall building. On the first
trial the rope was sent over to the
complete satisfaction of the inventor
and the delight of the large assem- '
blage of spectators who witnessed the
trials. The next time the cannon shot
the. rope skyward it went within a few
feet of the top of the building and fell
to the ground. The last attempt
pi ov'ed the poorest, as the rope went :
many yards short of its mark.
Miller Tells of Shooting.
Frank Miller, middle-aged, present
ee! himself at the Emergency Hospital
yesterday morning at 7 o'clock to have
two gunshots wounds on his head
dressed. He explained to the hospital
surgeon that he lived in Baden and
while enjoying himself in one of the
saloons at that place he was shot by
the bartender, for no other reason
than that he declined to treat one of
the hangers-on of the resort. After
receiving treatment at the hospital he
disappeared. The occurrence was not
reported to the police, as the San
Francisco jurisdiction does not extend
to Baden.
