LONDON, Sept. 2$. : â The executive
committee of the Irish Unionist Alli
ance to-night issued a statement re
garding the plan formulated by the
committee on organization of the
Irish Reform Association, which was
adopted at a meeting of the associa
tion at Dublin on Friday. The state
ment says:
"The Irish Reform Association is in
no sense representative and the pro
gramme adopted by it is altogether
contrary to the principles which have
always animated the great body of
Irish Unionists."
The committee condemns all the
propositions of the Irish Reform As
sociation as dangerous and holdsfthat
"safety, for the Unionists lies only in
equal treatment for every part of the
United Kingdom."
The programme of the Irish Reform
Association contemplates the .consti
tution of, an Irish Financial Council to
administer the $30,000,000 expended
annually' on Irish service.

UKIAH, Sept 26.â Several attempts
have recently been made to wreck the
Willits train, but no trace of the cul
prit could be found until last week
when Detective Powers was put to
work on the case. He succeeded in
getting a confession from Henry Clay
and William Van Bebber, two boys,
aged about 16, that they had placed
rails and wood on the track near
Lahm's Crossing, a very dangerous
place.
The boys were taken . before Judge
Kenworthy, who set their trial for Oc
tober SO, and released each of them on
$500 bonds.
The last attempt to wreck the train
was made Friday evening when the up
train was leaving Willits. Fortunately
the engine knocked the debris from the
track. .-/..".

LONDON*. Sept. 26. â The inquest
over the remains of George Alexander
Davis of Boston, Mass., who was found
dead in a London hotel, September 23,
to-day resulted in a verdict of "sui
cide while cane." It transpired that
Davis was a morphine victim, that he
was married on August 6, and that he
arrived with his bride in England
on September 14.
Davis broke off the morphine habit
prior to his marriage, but again be
came a victim to it. He i left letters
saying it was impossible to cure him
self, and that therefore he had de
termined to commit suicide. This he
did by cutting his arm with a razor
end then snipping the artery with a
pair of scissors, after taking a hypo
dermic Injection of morphine. Davis
was 26 years old.

The only jar of the session grew out
of the failure or refusal of. the chair

a protest against the nomination^of D.

tant, from the 'platform addressed a
few words" of a personal -nature to the
chairman, advising the later to. reflect
on the incidentthat he had by his rul
ing deprived' one delegation of Repub
licans of 'the right to be heard.

dorsing the constitutional amendment
creating an intermediate court was
added in pencil to the original draft of
the platform. â¢ Nominations for the Su
perior bench and the Legislature, as
forecasted in The Call, were â¢ made.
There was some agitation in the Forty
fourth Assembly j District in favor of
naming Jacob Steppacher for the As
sembly, but Jacob Shaen could not
muster force enough to smash the^ slate
on which the name of Mel Vogel was
inscribed. In the Thirty-second As-.

tancy in the nomination of Patrick J. (
Boyle of the Potrero, but at the finish
he was acclaimed the nominee.

with a discussion of the issues of tha
campaign. Mr. Hayes pointed out that

I CHAIRMAN OF TIDE LOCAL REPUBLICAN COyVEXTIOy ASP THE FOUR MKX IT NAMED FOR JUDGES OF THE SUPERIOR COCRT.
Graduated from the Columbia Law
School, to which he had come from
Hamilton College, Whiteman is well
known to many persons in this city.
After his graduation he went to Du
luth, Minn., where he began to practice
law. He was elected Mayor of that
city and was sent to the Legislature.
He became an active politician and was
at one time chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee. .- Suc
cessful in business ventures, he some
years ago was reputed to be worth
nearly a million dollars, but he lost his
fortune in speculation and became the
associate of reputed- professional
forgers and swindlers.
Arrested and sentenced to imprison
ment many times. Whiteman has in
several instances escaped incarceration.
His record, furnished by the Pinkerton
Detective Agency, whose men assisted
in his capture by the police of St.
Louis, shows that he was arrested In
1895 in San Francisco for forgery. He
was convicted and sentenced to nine
years' imprisonment, but secured a new
trial and was released on a techni
cality.
In 1S9S he was arrested In St. Louis
and transferred to Chicago, where he
was sentenced to one year's Imprison
ment and a fine of 52000. He appealed
and was released on bail. The decision
of the lower court was affirmed and
Whiteman failed to appear.
Whiteman was living at the Hotel
Jefferson in St. Louis under the name
of George H. Prentice. In his pockets,
when searched, was an undated check
for $20(X) on the New Amsterdam Bank
uf this city, drawn in his favor. Sev
eral other checks, check perforators,
dates, rubber stamps and other para
phernalia, were found in his room.
Whitt-man was charged with having
raised drafts on the Fidelity Trust
Company of Buffalo, the drafts Having
been purchased from country banks in
this State and originally being for
small amounts.
NEW YORK. Sept. 26.â Believing
that in the arrest erf Alonzo J. White

Ep*ciaJ Dispatch to The CalL
"The Court of Appeals has some
times been extremely liberal in allow
ing individuals and corporations to
combine in such a manner as to control
trade. In Wood vs. Whitehead Bros.
Company the opinion of the court, in
which Judge Parker concurred, says:
'Contracts between parties which have
for their object the removal of rivals
and competitors in business are not to
be regarded as contracts in restraint
of trade. They do not close the field
of competition, except to the particular
party to be affected. To say. at the
present day that such contract as was
made In this c&se>was \u25a0 affected" bjTpub
lic interest and was a matter of . pub
lic concern would be unreasonable.*
"Under such a view of the law it
would not be a difficult matter for any
trust to eliminate competition, even
without buying the plants and property
of its competing rivals. It could make
agreements with such competitors and
thus acquire an ultimate monopoly.
"In another case, where the terms
of a contract were particularly fla
grant. Judge Parker decided against
an agreement creating a monopoly.
Reconciling these authorities, it may be
said that, under the law as established
by the Court of Appeals, trusts are re
quired to observe certain skill as to the
forms of their consolidations; but, if
they understand how to do it, combina
tions to control trade can be made with
impunity. It is easy to see why the
nomination of Judge Parker has been
satisfactory to many of the trusts."
NEW YORK, Sept. 26.â George B.
Cortelyou and his associates on the Re
publican National Committee to-day
attacked Judge * Parker's record on
trust decisions. In an interview given
for publication William Dudley>Foulke
of Indiana, formerly Civil Service Com
missioner under President Roosevelt,
said in part:
"Judge Parker declares the common
law principles can be applied by the
United States courts to trusts in cases
involving interstate commerce. It is,
therefore, interesting to inquire what
are these common law principles, as in
terpreted by Judge Parker himself and
by his associates on the bench of the
Court of Appeals.
Special Dispatch to The Call
It , will remain for the Governor of
Massachusetts to take initial action in
this case, which will require prompt
redress. The last important. precedent
occurred in 1892 at the picnic resort of
Bay Ridge, near Baltimore, when Dr.
George, an attache of the Swiss lega
tion in Washington, was arrested by a
Deputy Sheriff on the charge of being
a pickpocket and was searched and
otherwise treated in a humiliating
manner by the local authorities. The
State Department secured his release
at an early moment through the Gov
ernor of Maryland, who also caused the
dismissal of the offending deputy and
extended an apology for the Incident.
Though the Swiss Minister might have
pressed further punishment, he ac
cepted what had been done as suf
ficient, but the matter was deemed of
such importance that he could not give
this notice to our Government until the
Swiss Federation Council had for
mally considered the case and ex
pressed itself satisfied. â¢
The State Department immediately
transmitted Raikes 1 telegram, in sub
stance, to the Governor of Massachu
setts with the request that he do what
ever might be necessary to secure the
diplomatic immunity of Gurney.
It is believed at the department that
the matter may be far more serious
than the local officers at Lee seem to
regard it. In the first place, by consti
tutional and statutory laws, the per
sons attached to an embassy are ex
pressly relieved from any legal re
sponsibility, and the exemplification
even extends to domestic servants. Sec
tion 4063, Revised Statutes, declares
that any writ prosecuted in any court
of the United States or of a State or
by any Judge or Justice intended to
cause the arrest and imprisonment of
any public Minister or his servant shall
be void. The succeeding section, 4064,
Revised Statutes, provides that every
person by whom any such protest is ob
tained or prosecuted, whether as party
or attorney, and every officer concerned
in its execution "shall be deemed a vio
lator of the law of nations and a dis
turber of the public repose and shall
be imprisoned for not more than three
years and fined at the discretion of the
court."
PROMPT REDRESS REQUIRED.
Gurney did not have in his possession
sufficient money to pay the fine and he
was^commltted to the charge . of the
officer who made the arrest.- "The offi
cer accompanied Gurney to Lenox,
where the money was secured.
STATE DEPARTMENT ACTS.
Special Justice Phelps said he did not
recognize international law in his court
and informed the defendant that he
must enter a plea. Gurney persisted In
his. refusal. Then a fine was imposed
for contempt of court. .
Gurney, when arraigned, positively
refused to plead, claiming that as he
was "third secretary to his Britannic
Majesty he could not under inter
national law be arrested or held for
any crime."
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26.â The atten
tion of the State Department has been
called by the British charge here to the
action of a Special Justice at Lee,
Mass., in fining Hugh Gurney, third
secretary of the British embassy, for
fast driving with an automobile and
contempt of court. The details of the
incident had been conveyed to the Brit
ish charge by Mr. Raikes, first secre
tary of the embassy, who is at Lenox.
Third Secretary Gurney was to-day
fined in the Police Court at Lee on
two charges. For contempt of court
he. was fined $25. A similar fine was
imposed in the case charging him with
speeding his automobile in Stockbrldge
Sunday.

Glendive, Miles City and Forsythe, ana
the night was spent , here, where a
largely, attended and very enthusiastic
meeting was held.
Here Fairbanks returned to the irri
gation question, discussing at length
the effect of the reclamation act. He
recalled Senate recommendations, for
national aid made by Senator Cartel,
when he was Commissioner, of the
General Land Office in 1891. and after
dwelling at length upon the general
question of irrigation entered upon a
discussion of President Roosevelt's
part in securing the enactmentof the
existing law. On the latter point he
said:;
.Ten years after Senator Carter brought this
great lrrigsitlon : subject to the attention ; of
the American people we had another American
who dealt with it in a high minded. Intelli
gent way. "He had been -a part of your citt
zcnahlp for years. He had dwelt here in the

leaders hope to persuade him. Harry

HEARST TO QUIT CONGRESS.
The Democratic convention which met In
St. Louis deliberately makes claim to having
accomplished this great object. It is one of
the things upon which" It prides itself now: I
am - not blaming them for that, not at an.
They do not have many opportunities to make
claim to \u25a0 the accomplishment of any- grmu
government measure The only way they can
get a little modicum of credit Is to lay claim
to the achievement* of thÂ» Republican party.
Fairbanks also referred to the
Democratic platform on the subject
of irrigation, saying:
seral-arld regions. He knew thÂ« conditions
and the possibilities. He knew the groat fu
ture that wag awaiting you. If you could only
bring water to the parched soil of this great
country; that great statesman who compre
hended, therefore, the possibilities that liÂ»
before you here, is our President and the next
President of the United . States, Theodore
Roosevelt.
In bis very first " message to the United
States Congress he dwelt upon the necessity of
dealing with the great subject of irrigation,
and pointed out how it was possible to utilise
the public domain of the United States so as
not to draw directly upon the Treasury in
Washington. He thought it but Just and
equitable that the proceeds of the sales of
these lands should be utilized for the purpose
of irrigating this great country. I have Just
traveled over many miles of country where
there is no sign of the habitation of man, but
under the inspiration or this great policy
which Congress enacted Into law I am opti
mistic enough to believe that in the years
lyinÂ« before us there will be homes occupied
by ' thousands of energetic patriotic American
citizens where there are now only deserts.

LOSES BOTH PARENTS.
Ttipy are too common In America, especially
of late. The fact that It is a larpe country,
with clenty cf room fcr them to happen in.
Is not. Fufficknt to explain them. Probably the
fundamental cause Is the hasty and imperfect
construction of the lines, the makeshift ar
rareemepts for Bavins- time and the general
nioh of Btrenuour national life.
For the first time the fact is now re
vealed that Plehwe's murder had been
preceded by four abortive attempts to
encompass his death, which the depart
ment of political police frustrated in
ihe nick of time by the arrest of the
would-be assassins, . who were quietly
imprisoned or banished. Only one of
these attempts has hitherto become
public and that was revealed by the
accidental explosion of a bomb In the
Hotel du Nord, in St. Petersburg.
Sassonoff and two of his accomplices
continue to maintain obstinate silence
regarding the assassination of Minis
ter Plehwe, although one of the accom
plices has confessed that he threw a
bomb into the canal on the morning of
the assassination. Bernstein, the other
accomplice,' obeying the injunction of
the terrorists, refuses to make any
statement.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 27.â While
some of the features of the plot which
culminated in the assassination of
Plehwe, the Minister of the Interior,
â¢till baffle the police, the authorities
profess to be now perfectly certain that
the conspiracy was hatched in Geneva
by a half dozen Russians, mostlj; Jews.
The authorities know the names and
address of the conspirators, but are
unable to take legal action against
them owing to the failure of the laws
of Switzerland to interfere with po
litical refugees. Therefore Russian
terrorists are at liberty, from their ha
ven in the Alps, to continue the' work
cf assassination of Russian Ministers
so long as they are able to flnd emis
saries willing to risk their lives, the
originators never venturing to carry
cur their own designs.
Six men who engineered the Plehwe
plot, according to the result of the
Russian police investigation, are de
clared, beyond shadow of doubt to have
organized the series of political crimes,
with the exception of the murder of
Bobrikoff, the Governor General of
Finland, which series began with the
assassination of Bogdanovitch, Gov
ernor of Ufa, on May 19, 1903, and end
ed with the murder of Minister Plehwe
on July 28 of this . year. " Gerchunin,
whose plot resulted in the assassina
tion of Minister of the Interior Sipia
guine on April 15, 1902, now turns out
to have only been an emissary of these
Geneva terrorists.- s. \u25a0 /" \ â¢
A renewal of the ; fight between the
Hackmen's Union and the Stable and
Carriage Owners' Association is threat
ened. The president and secretary of
the Master Horseshoeing Association
called upon Secretary White of the
Stable and Carriage Owners'. Associa
tion a few days ago and informed him
that it was the intention of the Journey
men horseshoers to quit work if their
bosses persisted in shoeing horses from
non-union stables. This announcement
dumfounded Secretary White for the
time being, aa he had been led to be
lieve that all differences had been ad-
Justed at the recent conference in
Mayor Schmitz's office.
Secretary White said the association
had lived up to its agreement to give
the union men an equal show, both as
to employment in the stables and in
driving hacks.
He was also informed by President
M. W. Coffey of the hackmen's union
that henceforth union drivers would
decline to drive at funerals where non
union drivers were employed. White
says this is a breach of the agreement
reached at the conference in the May
or's office and adds that at the present
time 90 per cent of the union hackmen
are employed at union rates.
At the meeting of the Stable and
Carriage Owners' Association last night
Secretary White was instructed to
communicate with the Master Horse
Shoers* Association declining to make
any concessions regarding the union
izing of the stables belonging to. the
association.

Delegates elected last night bv Local

Council next Thursday night and de
mand that they be seated. The action
of Union No. 19 in demanding recogni
tion by the Building Trades Council is
the immediate result of the decision of
Superior Judge Hunt, who dissolved
the temporary injunction secured by
the Sheehan faction restraining Local
No. 1& from using that name. The
court also held that Sheehan, whose
claims to the presidency of the union
had the backing of the Building
Trades Council, was not legally enti^
tied to the office. This double-headed
decision was a victory for No. 19, and
It now seeks to compel the Building
Trades Council to accept the court's
ruling bv according recognition, long
withheld, to its delegates. Should the
Building Trades Council refuse to ad
mit the delegates further recourse to
the courts may be had.

SAN JOSE, Sept. 26. â A meeting of
the State Sempervirens Club has been
called for Friday, September 30, at the
Unitarian church at San Jose. The
meeting has been called for the pur
pose of discussing the matter of a State
road from the summit of Castle Rock
Kidge, above the town of Saratoga,
Santa Clara County, to the California
Slate Redwood Park.' better known as
the Big Basin Park. Following are ex
tracts from a circular letter sent out
by the club:
The Importance of this undertaking must be
patent to all who may recall the fact that
this incomparable virgin forest has been,
up to this time practically Inaccessible except
by tortuous trails over the mountain fastnesses
which for centuries have stood guard above It. 1
Now that this forest has been acquired by
the people of California It becomes absolutely
necessary that Immediate steps be taken to
provide methods of Ingress suitable for the
uses for which it Is Intended. A route has
been surveyed along and over a natural ridge,
the' only formation of Its kind to be found
adjacent to the basin, and which, if adopted,
will permit the building of a highway of most
excellent grade at a very reasonable expense.
The completion of a road as proposed would
brin= the basin within seventeen and a half
miles of Santa Clara County, or twelve miles
by an air line.
We are Dleased to announce that a large
number of influential citizens of the State, to
gether with public officials, have already ex
pressed their approval of this plan, and de
sire to co-operate with us. Representatives of
various boards of trade, and other commer
cial bodies and fraternal societies will be
present from the coast counties, to co-operate
with the various county officials to make
this meeting a success.

. NEWTON, Mass., Sept. 26.â Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge was the guest "of
the Newton Club at dinner to T night and
in a speech following the dinner ad
vocated a policy J&of reciprocity that
would bring compensation ' to the
United States for concessions made and
not prove inimical to American inter
ests. Senator Lodge said that he had
been asked to speak on the subject of
reciprocity and the relation of the two
great political parties to that question.
He continued:
Every one is in favor of reciprocity or any
other policy which will enlarge our foreign
markets, provided that such reciprocity or other
similar policy does not involve a greater sacri
fice than the proposed enlargement of the for
eign market is worth. But because I favor
reciprocity under these conditions I do not
promise to .support any scheme of legislation
or any treaty that any one chooses to labjl
reciprocity. I must reserve my absolute right
to Judge the merits of any scheme when it
arises in accordance with what I believe to be
the best interests of my country and my State.
Either the Democrats do not'favo" reciproci
ty or they do not favor a reduction of duties,
because the two together are impossible and
Incompatible. I should be glad to vote for a
reciprocity treaty with Canada or any other
country which was beneficial to our business
interests and not injurious to American indus
try, agriculture 'or labor. But there is no use
in shutting our eyes to the practical difficulty
which the history of these treaties discloses. I
think we should consider very carefully
whether the true way to improve our foreign
markets is not by general legislation \Â»hich
will bring a general reciprocity and which
shall bear equally on all parts of the United
States, and. If successful, bring benefits to the
whole country.

Speaker Cannon reviewed the history
of the law under which the order was
made and the construction placed on
i*t by Presidents Cleveland and McKin
ley, and continued:
Now, then, when that order of Roosevelt's
was Issued the dickens was to pay, although
along the same principle and in the same man
ner as formerly issued by Cleveland and Mc-
Kinley, and they have been raising a row
about it eve r since, talking of executive usurp
ation. In Parker's first acceptance by speech
he complained of the expenditures of the Gov
ernment under Republican rule, and Roosevelt
came back at him and said: "How are you
going to cut down these expenditures? Are
you for the repeal of that executive order re
lating to the soldiers?"
And Parker now comes back in his letter of
acceptance, Just issued, and Baya: "If I am
elected President 1 will rescind that order."
And then he goes on and says: "But after I
rescind It, I will use, my influence with Con
gress to pasa a bill giving an age service pen
sion to the soldier lhat performed service in
the Civil War." x
I ask: "What age, Parker? What age?
Will it be 75. Â«6, 62 years, or what? Indefinite
yet still, and probably not sincere.' but sup
pose you are elected President, Mry Parker,
and you use your Influence, what will that
bring in the meantime? From 25.0CO to 60,000
people will have their pensions taken away,
while you promise to use your influence to
have Congress pass a service-pension law with
out stating the age you propose to recognize.
"Now, 1 ask you Mr. Parker, if you are
elected President; who will control the House
of Representatives? Will not two- thirds of
the Democrats of that body be made up of
members from the South; and are they liberal
people with pensions for' the Union soldiers?"
Let us read a chapter from Ae history of
pension legislation as it stands on the statute
books to-day. There have been fourteen bills
passed from time to time and thesei bills form
the Pension Code. Who passed them? Demo
crats for the bills 417; Democrats against the
bills. 648; Republicans for the bills. KKiS; Re
publicans against the bills, none. That's how
the record of the vote upon those measures
stands. Is there any hope therefore for Mr.
Parker's Influence to be effective? He is to
take pensions away from thousands of people
and only- replace them by a promise to use
his influence with a party in Congress that
has a notorious record against that very thing.

Judge James M. Troutt was placed
in nomination by A. J. Dannenbaum of

substance of his speech is as follows:
It is of prime and essential importance to
this community to have men of honesty and
stability on the bench.
A Judge must underhand the law and have
the backbone to enforce it, and he must be
ponsesse'i in addition of sufficient human sym
pathy to tr-mi*r justice with mercy
The legal ability of Judge Troutt is known
from one end of this State to the other. A
graduate of Harvard College, for sixteen
years an attorney of the highest standing at
t-e bar of this State, for fourteen years he
has occupied -the position of Judge of the

E. J. Pringle of the Forty-first As

James L. Gallagher before the con

Superior Judge of the city and county
of San Francisco in the following
short speech:
I propose the name of a candidate for Judge
of the Superior Court who is well known in
San Francisco. He has had a varied car-er in
this city for fifteen or twenty years and is
known as an honest, upright and fair attorney.
1 give you the name of James L.. Gallagher.
The name of Daniel W. Burchard
for the office of Judge of the Superior
Court was Dlaced before the conven
tion in a short speech by "William J.
Herrin of the Forty-second District.
Mr. Herrin said in part:
I wish to nominate a man who is a true Re
publican, a man of Integrity, ability, industry;
a man of family and the home. He has served
six years as District Attorney of Santa Clara.
He has made some enemies, but every man in
office makes enemies; they only prove his
worth, lie has already received the indorse
ment of one convention. Every Judge should
bÂ« pledged to dispense equal Juftice to any
party that may appe&r before him. I feel
confident that Daniel W. Burchard will fear
lessly perform his duties.
Judge Kerrigan's nomination was
seconded by Samuel Feigenbaum and
other delegates that were anxious to
record their districts as favorable to
Judge Kerrigan's candidacy.
At the conclusion of the reading of
the platform Thomas D. Riordan took
the platform to nominate Frank H.
Kerrigan for Judge of the Superior.
Court. In part Mr. Riordan said:
The gentleman whose name I propose placing
before you for nomination for Judge of the
Superior Court needs no commendation from
ra*. Four years ago I had the honor of
facing his name before you for nomination
for the short term of the office he now houis.
Prior to that time the Republicans had hon
ored him by placing him in the office of
Justice of the Peace. After serving in that
office it was found that his record entitled
him to promotion at our hands, and he was
given the nomination for Superior Judge and
was elected. His record of the last four years
again commends him to our support, and I
take pleasure in presenting to you for nom
ination for Superior Judge for the coming
term of six years the name of Frank H. Kerri
gan. He is a native son and a member of
many fraternal orders, and is popular in all
of them. If he is nominated I know that he
will poll a bigger majority than he did four

Gowan, for suppressing the right to a
roll call on the voting for the Judges.
Mr. Daly said that it was the first con

delegates had been gagged on a request

CONFUSION PREVAILS.
Judge Troutt's nomination was sec
onded by R. A. Hathorn. A motion that
the nominations cIosq prevailed, but a
motion that the secretary cast the bal
lot met with a howl from the Thirty-
fifth and Thirty-sixth districts. These
districts demanded that the roll be
called, but their demand met with a
resistance the chairman could not ig
nore. Amid much confusion he put a
motion made and seconded that the
secretary cast the ballot and it car
ried with a whoop. The delegates of
the protesting districts were so taken
by surprise that they overlooked the
call for "noes" on the motion and it ap
parently went through unanimously.
Following the nomination of the can
didates for the office of Superior Judge
came the confirmation of the nomina
tions made by each Senatorial district
convention. This business was trans
acted quickly, the ' various dis
tricts reporting their dominations in
numerical order. The Senatorial nomi
nations are as follows:

Golden Medical Discovery. This vegetable
medicine coaxes the digestive functions
and helps in the assimilation of food, or
rather takes from the food just the nutri-
ment the blood requires.
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
purifies the blood and entirely eradicates
the poisons that breed and feed disease.
It thus cures scrofula, ecsenia, erysipelas,
boils, pimples, and other eruptions that
mar and scar. the skin. Pure blood is
essential to good health. The weak, run-
down, debilitated condition which so many
people experience is commonly the effect
of impure blood. . Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery net only cleanses the
blood of imparities, but it increases the ac-

enriches the body with an abundant supply
of pure, rich blood.
"No matter bow powerful the intellect or

rank of brevet deputy lieutenant gen
eral and ordered to proceed to Tibet
to investigate and deal with Tibetan
affairs. Â« '
Tang is a Tale graduate and one of
China's shrewdest officers. He is op

tion he outranks the Chinese Amban
resident in Tibet, as well as all Chi
nese Ministers abroad, being the third
grade in the civil and the second
grade in the military hierarchy. As
the Amban has signed the Anglo-Ti

tests as an infringement of her ex
clusive rights, Tang's appointment
may be considered as China's answer
to the British demands.

The Pope recognizes that even on
this occasion God sent comfort through
the manifestation of filial affection re
ceived yesterday from the 10,000 mem
bers of the Catholic Association of
French youths, but he wishes to have
in Rome a solemn function of atone
ment for the outrage of divine majes
ty and for the vindication of the honor
and good name of the city.
The Pope says the insult was ren
dered the more grave by the free
thinkers meetinff in Rome, the city
which had been destined as a deposi
tory of the faith, thus taking from
Rome its designation as the tranquil,
respected see of Christ's vicar.
"We, therefore," the Pope adds, "will
make ours the offense offered to God,
gathering in our heart all its bitter
ness."
A new cause of bitterness has been added to
the many anxieties which, especially In our
time, accompany the government of the uni
versal church. We have learned with infinite
sorrow that It is asserted that the cultivators
of free ihoviuht have met In Rome, while,
the painful echo of their speeches is unfor
tunately confirmed by their grim signs. In
telligence Is the noblest gift the Creator has
granted us, but it becomes sacrilegious when
subtracted from dei>endency on the Almighty
or rejecting the direction and comfort of di
vine truth.

WASHINGTON. Sept. 26.â President
Roosevelt Is in receipt of a letter from
Luke E. Wright, Governor of the Phil
ippines, in which Wright discusses
frankly some of the conditions which
he encountered in directing the govern
ment of the islands. Under date of
August 15 General Wright wrote In
part as follows:
ThÂ» continued dfscusslon of the capacity of
the Filipino for self-government is having Its
effect here and makes our task more difficult
than it otherwise would be. The leas a man
is equipped with intelligence and those quali
ties which make for good citizenship, the mora
easily can he be persuaded that he is thÂ«
possessor of all these qualities. These people
have their full share of ambition and vanity
and they also have their full share of reck
less, half- formed characters, who are ready
for Intrigue In any direction which promises
them profit or power. It is this class whlcb
has largely given force and direction to the
Agllpayan movement and has recruited Us
ranks from the ignorant and dangerous ele
ments.
In this general connection I may say to you.
as a matter of Information, that the agitation
â¢In the United States for Filipino Independence
and the spoken and written utterances of
prominent men there, who are urging it. arÂ»
all brought here and published in the native
newspapers and are being made the text for
editorials Insisting that the Philippine peopl*
are now ready to become an Independent na
tion.
The effect of all this is distinctly injurious.
Its tendency Is to renew the lnÂ£ueneÂ« cf old
Insurrection leaders and make them aetlv*
In preaching the old propaganda. This. In
turn, has the effect of demoralizing and weak
ening the more conservative and thoughtful
Filipinos, who fear that if they apÂ«ak out as
they really think they would he considered th*
enemies of their people and lose their prentlss
with them. . Thoae of the more- prominent and

to the delegates of the Interparlia

world to send delegates to a second
peace conference whose work should
be supplemental to that of the con

through the medium of arbitration.
Quite naturally, the question arose as
to how soon the President might call
the conference. He did not Indicate,
in his address, the probable time of
his Issuance of the call, but it can be
stated that he will not await the con

Russia, both signatories to The Hague
convention, before issuing his call. It
is his present intention, in about six
weeks, to bring the matter to the at

BERLIN INTERESTED
German Foreign Office In Sympathy
With Mr. Roosevelt's Plan.
BERLIN, Sept 26. â President
Roosevelt's announcement Saturday of
his intention to call a second peace
conference of the nations of the world,
whose work should be supplemental
to that of The Hague arbitration con
ference, attracts much attention here.
The Foreign Office expresses Itself
generally as sympathetic- toward the
idea if the President's propositions are
confined to practical, tangible meas
ures, without attempting anything like
general disarmament or an adjudica
tion of the difficulties which touch the
sovereignty and honor of states, as
would be involved In any scheme of
compulsory arbitration.
Among the foreign embassies here
It was learned by a representative of
the Associated Press that the idea of
an international peace conference
during the Russo-Japanese \u25a0war would
be considered inopportune by Russia,
as questions now under controversy
between Russia and several of the
neutral powers would most likely
come before It The necessity for a
conference after the war to define
contraband and the extent to which
neutrals may assist belligerents by the
sale of ships and munitions is fully
recognized.
GREAT BRITAIN APPROVES.
Authorities in London Would Send
. Representative to The Hague.
LONDON, Sept 28.â The Foreign
Office has received no official intima
tion from Washington of the intention
of President Roosevelt to call a second
peace conference at The Hague. It
states if such an Invitation Is extend
ed undoubtedly Great Britain will be
represented. It is suggested, however,
that the President, when he extends
the invitation, will fix a date so that
the meeting will take place after Jap
an and Russia have arranged for
peace.

BAKBRSFTELD, Sept. 26. â Burg

on the oil field road last night and
after carrying: . away whatever was
portable set fire to the bulldlnr and
burned It to the ground. The prop
erty belonged to- S. C. Oldham and

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 26.â The
navaJ organ, Kotlin, to-day publishes
an article predicting that Rear Admiral
Wiren will attempt to break out of
Port Arthur with his ships and return
to Europe. The paper admits that the
task of escaping from Admiral Togo
appears to be hopeless, if one takes for
comparison Admiral Cervera's attempt
to get away from Santiago, but adds
that Wlren's men, unlike the Spaniards,
have plenty of experience.
The Russ and the Invalid, both re
ferring in a matter of fact tone to the
Imperial rescript issued on Sunday,
simply say It was necessitated by the
fact ,that the Manchurian army has
grown beyond the size which even Na
poleon found one man could handle
successfully.
The Russ adds the hope that Gen
oral Kuropatkin will be allowed to as
sume supreme command and thus reap
the fruits of ultimate victory, for
which he has so long carefully and
self-sacriflcingly prepared.
LONDON. Sept. 27.â Telegraphing

I., was -elected chairman. The nomina
tions of 100 new members were then
approved.
The first order of business upon the
reconvening of the session was the
election of 13S new members, whose

.ST. LOUIS, Sept. 26.â The largest and
.most represent a Live gathering in the
nlyjory of the American Bar Associa

'twenty-sevent-h annual convention of
the association, which convened to
day. Among the COO members of the
association in attendance, together
uith the many foreign delegates to the
Universal Congress of Lawyers and
Jurists, are Associate Justice Brewer
oÂ£ thf- United St2tes Supreme Court;
Hon. John W. Foster, former Secretary
of State; and Sir William Kennedy,
Chief Justice of the High Court of
England. The crowded balcony of vis
itors evinced the widespread interest
taken in the meeting.
The convention continues until Wed
nesday noon, when the Universal Con

semble under the auspices of the asso

The me^tinr was called to order by
James Hagerman of St. Louis, 'presi

welcome were made by President Fran
cis of the Louisiana Purchase Exposi
tion, President John D. Lawson of the
Missouri Bar Association and Presi
dent Klein of the Bar Association of
St. Louis. President Hajrerman then
delivered his address, in which he com
municated the most noteworthy
ohajiges in statute law on points of
general interest made in the several
States and by Congress during the pre
ceding year. He said in part:
Ccnrress hi* passed crÂ«? very Important
act. of far-reaching consequence, to regulate
â¢hipplnr :n trade between ports of the United
States and rort* or places in the Philippine
Archlpelaco. and between port* or places In
the Philippines. In tcy Judgment the need
Â«-f the time* Is that the mandate should go
forth to the American r*op!e, as the Judg
ment of their bench and bar. that Terri
t rles ciui only be penracecUy held by the
felted 8tateÂ» upon the condition that the
residents and Inhabitants shall be citizens
v! the United States and that there shaU
be no tar!? laws between such Territories
and the states of the Union, but all shall
bÂ» within that tone of freÂ« trade, which
fc*s heretofore included our States and Ter
ritories. I am not one of those who think.lt
I- absolutely essential that Territories of
the United States should be admitted ta state
hood, for I believe thÂ« under our system
Territories can be governed as such in har
mony with our republican-democratic con
stitutional principles.
LONDON. Sept. 27.â According to
the Daily Mail's correspondent at Liao
yang, general orders were discovered
by the Japanese in a building at Liao
yang which hud been used by the Rus
sians as headquarters. These orders
reveal an amazing lack of discipline
In General Kuropatkin's army. They
show that several commanding officers
have been cashiered.
T'ae commander of the Second Ural
Cossacks was removed on July 11 for
abandoning a position upon hearing
that the Japanese were approaching.
He made no investigation of the ru
mor. His retirement seriously endan
gered the Russian operations.
Two colonels of Siberian sharp
shooters were cashiered on July 23. No
reason for this action Is given in the
orders. The commander of the Fifth
Cossacks was cashiered for habitual
drunkenness and behavior unbecom
ing an officer.
The correspondent adds that these
orders show conduct that is In strik
ing contrast to that of the Japanese,
whose sobriety, orderliness and perfect
discipline have excited the admiration
of observers throughout the war.
A general order was issued on July
33 censuring officers for publicly be
littling: the ability of their superiors.
Another order stated that ammuni
tion and transport wagons were often
needlessly abandoned on the field and
directed that greater care be exercised
in view of the difficulty of replacing
them. Quick-firing batteries were cen
sured for wasting ammunition and for
wild firing.
. Another order, issued on July 28,
strongly rebuked non-commissioned of
ficers- for destroying Chinese property
and mistreating women. The trouble,
apparently, was not stopped, for on Au
gust 3* an order again denounced acts
of this character and ordered regi
mental commanders to be more vigi
lant.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 26. â The
cause of the extreme deliberation In
the Japanese advance on Mukden was
explained by a dispatch from General
Kuropatkin this afternoon, which In
dicates that Field Marshal- Oyama has
not yet concentrated his forges. Fresh
troops are constantly arriving at Ben
slaputze, while others which recently
reached Liaoyang are marching up
the- Taltse River to Slanchan. These
reinforcements, presumably, come
from Japan. As soon as the fourth
Japanese army, at Sianchan, is suffi
ciently strong, it is now evident, the
Japanese intend to resort to their fa
vorite flanking tactics, move a formid
able array again Kuropatkin's left and
compel the evacuation of Sintslntin.
They evidently are reconnoitering the
ground over which the Sianchan army
will march up and cross the river.
Meanwhile General Kuroki is trying
to seize and cross the Hun River far
east of Mukden. Thence he will move
down the river and co-operate with
the fourth army from Sianchan, while
Oku and Nodzu engage Kuropat
kin's attention south of Mukden. The
attacks on Da Pass and Sanlungku on
September 20 were the first symptoms
of this vast flanking movement.
Kuropatkin now reports that Jap
anese scouts have been encountered
nfcar the Hun River, half way to Muk
den, trying to seize Kaoutou Pass, ten
miles northeast of Bentslaputze, in or
der to clear the way to Fushun, and
that Oku's and Nodzu'8 outposts have
been engaged in heavy skirmishing
with Cossacks near Inpu, between
Eentsiaputze and the railroad.
The Mongolia was twice cut off from
the squadron, but the Japanese sig
naled her to steer to the left, which
she did. Once the Mongolia was be
tween two fires and frequently the
Japanese torpedo-boats passed quite
close to her, but she was not attacked
throughout the fight and returned
safely to Port Arthur.

several thousand hearers to vote for
all the bonds. They reminded the au
dience of cheering citizens that to over
look one of the- propositions might en
danger the entire issue. They appealed
to the loyalty and tne progressive
spirit of the community. They refuted
the cry that the bond issue would mean
a heavy drain on the taxpayers. They
showed that the average increase in
the tax rate for the forty years of. the
bonds' life, if every one of them should
carry, would be only 17 cents annually.
For the first year the rate would be,
only 31 cents on the $100, or an average'
of 50 cents a month, the price of a few
cigars. And John A. Britton pledged
his word that these figures are correct.
The parade this evening was headed
by Charles J. Heeseman, marshal and
organizer, 'with C. D. Bates Jr., F. A.
Steams, W. H. J. Matthews, Edwin
Steams,- C, E. Cotton, F. C. Watson,
D. J. Hallahan, M. J. Keller, C. W.
Petry and J. B. Reboli as aids. The
Musicians' Union furnished the music
from four bands without cost, a testi
monial of the organization's sentiment.
Many representatives of labor unions
were in the line.
WATCHWORDS OP PROGRESS.
"Don't be a Clam, Vote for the
Bonds," was the legend which the busi
ness men heralded to the crowd.
. "We will all pull together.". \u25a0_.
. "Give us your support."
"Oakland must go ahead."
These were some of the sentiments
that were expressed on the ." banners
borne in the line. , \u25a0
Through Broadway, Washington -and
Eleventh streets the line wound its way
to the High School. Edwin Steams
called the meeting. to order. He said:
It is ray pleasant duty to call you together
on the eve of the election day that- shall de
cide whether Oakland is .to Jump, forward' for'
the next twenty -flve years or remain as cha
has been for ten years past. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 If " you vote
"yes" on every one of the propositions that
the City Council has presented to you Oakland
will advance as you never had an Idea that
she could or would advance. . Let us bear now
Colonel . John P. Irish made .an elo
quent plea for the bonds. He* declared
his concurrence with Mayor Olney in
the thought, that it is no.w or never
with Oakland for improvements. Col
onel Irish continued:
I have read with diligence and care the
arguments against the bonds. If those argu
ments have any validity they are arguments
against public Improvements. There Is no
patent plan in the affairs of men by which
Individuals or municipalities can set something
for nothing. LoÂ« Angeles did not get some
thing--for nothing. A few years ago Los
Atureles, dry, dusty, and dirty, was a spot on
the desert. Los Angeles has passed us. Why?
Because' there is assembled in that city a set
of people who are death to knockers. I am
Informed that Los Angeles . bonded for 45
cunts on the $100 to build parks, to ' create
public Improvements, to adorn and to beau
tify the city. They had no natural water
park, ao they made two of them, and made
them beautiful, thaugh each of them is as a
handful of water compared to our own . neg
lected Lake Merrttt. \u25a0
We marvel why Los Angeles has passed
us. Phe has gone ahead because her people
stand, together; because they know the health,
beauty, attractiveness of the . city depend
upon public improvements. No city on earth
was ever improved to death. Many a one
has been improved to life.
-The knocker Is abroad In the land assailing
the bond Issue hip and thigh. I say there has
never been a better scheme foi^ the- symmetrical
publlo Improvement of . this city ever con
ceived or submitted to our people. The Mayor
and the City Council deserve credit 'Â«r the
Intelligent, honest and harmonious plaa they
have prepared;
Pitiful, indeed, that the action of any man in
Oakland at" the polls to-morrow should be direct
ed by such arguments as have been advanced
to vote down the bonds. , Oakland cannot get
fat by walking in her own gutters, by stew
ing In her . own Juice, by . rag chewing. The
people . who have . the most Interest In this
project ar* the . worklngmen. Hundreds of
thousands of dollars will be spent In labor on
the parks and building.. And these parks. will
Mayor Olney said:
The Mayor 0 I your city Is not an orator, but
I Â«Ã¼bmlt to you that his long residence In this
city, his wide acquaintance with Its people and
his great affection for Oakland give him the
right to say a word In behalf of this great
scheme of betterment. For thirty years I
have lived In Oakland. Our city seems to |
have taken on a new spirit and to have awak
ened. Our people seem to realize the advan
tages of creating a modern city here a city
of which we can be proud. Such a city we
can create if We do our duty to-morrow at
the polls.
The city government has prepared and sub
mitted to you an :laborata and- carefully
planned scheme of public improvements. It
has taken many years to shape thin plan. Com
mitte* after committee of prominent citizens
has worked on bond Issues for public Im
provements. Not until now has it taken con
crete form. As presented to you. each and
every one of these items is absolutely neces
sary to the progress of Oakland. But It is a
certainty that you cannot get these good
things without apendlng com* money.
Municipalities must - borrow money to begin
such Improvements and pay for; thorn, after they
are made. There Is absolutely no other way
to make these Improvements. Now a word to
thoso whose taxes are not heavy: There is no
one in the community that la more Interested
in the bond* than such as those who pay
such taxes. It la those who should Join witn
the heavy property owners in this movement.
The poor man pays much less on the bonds
than such property owners an the Bacon peo
ple, the Uelgers and the like. I know of
no echeme by which the poor man gets as
much .benefit from taxes as from a bond I*
buÂ« for public Improvements. Don't "plump."
Vote for ail the bonds. If you "plump" yjm
.may jeopardize the whole vote, for the courts
might say that a two- thirds vote had not
been cast for all of the bonds if one. ltem was
much heavier than another. Vote for all of
them. I repeat. You cannot have a modern
city without a park, and It looks to mo as
If this 'would be the last chance you wilt
have to get. a park. . .Show yourselves to-mor

cite I deaire to say that it is the crowning
jewel in a transcendentally beautiful plat

NO USE FOR SILURIANS.
John A. Britton declared that foi
thirty years in Oakland he had been
a consistent fighter against Silurian
{ ism. He said the people of Oakland
were now called upon to do something
for their city and their homes. He re
membered when oak trees grew on
Broadway, when two wheezy horse cai
lines furnished transportation, when
business stooped at Tenth street. He
continued, In part: \\
Oakland had. little population then, but much
spirit. It has lapsed of late In spirit because
many of our people lost faith. You have the
opportunity now to restore confidence, to up
lift and to advance. I have ceen parks In
many cities of our country. Hut never a site
that possesses such natural advantages as the
proposed central park. Why are we so slow
In taking advantage of these things? - 1 be
speak your support for every one of the bond
Items. I have for many years seen city conn,
ells come and go In Oakland, but I have never
seen a City Council the equal of our present
one for steadfastness, progress, honesty of
purpose and Intelligence. It stands head and
shoulders above any you ever had In Oakland
These, then, are the men who have planned
this bond issue. It behooves you to vote for
It right down the line. . *
Henry A. Butters was Introduced as
a. man who had made a fortune abroad
and had returned to Oakland to live.
Mr. Butters said:
There are large money interests In Oakland
that will have to pay heavily in Interest on
these bonds. It is these. corporations that are
financially concerned. You understand now
what is the matter. The officeâ¢ of these cor
porations have- grown up in an atmosphere
that Is strangling their enterprise. You may
talk about all kinds of resources, but there is
one kind that means much. If you can get
1000 rich men to come here and spend $5000 or
$10,000 each winter, there are resources that
count. These improvements make for the poor
man. He gets the best of them. I want you
to remember that the burden of the * 3t 3 t falls
en thÂ« rich man every time.

,By making monstrous charges
against the Rev. Paul Stewart of the
United " Presbyterian Church, Mrs.
; Anna Stewart, his wife, gained her re
lease from a charge of insanity to-day
and she was taken to the Providence
Hospital for treatment for a tempor
ary physical ailment. She declares her
husband, is a hypocrite and threatens
to sue him for a divorce on the ground
of cruelty. The charges she made
against him were of such a revolting
nature that the courtroom was cleared
of every one except those whose pres
ence was needed when sne recited her
story. - ' .
After an exhaustive examination ex
tending over several, hours, In which
< many witnesses wereexamined, Dr. A.
'H. Pratt stated to Judge Hall that he
'believed Mrs. Stewart was Insane. He
based his conclusion on the fact that
she admitted having tried upon several
occasions to take her own lffe; that
she had been confined in several asy
lums and was there considered insane
by reputable physician?, and that she
made -charges of immorality against,
her husband and an old aunt, nearly
80 years of age, which were beyond be
lief. Mrs. Stewart denied having made
the charge, but both Stewart and Miss
p:iiza Curry, the aunt, said she had
accused them both.
Dr. Myra Knox was not willing to go
so far as to say the woman was insane,
but thought she should go to a hos
pital for treatment. At this Juncture
the attorney for Mrs. Stewart said he
had hoped a part of the. charges made
by Mrs. Stewart would not have to be
gone Into, but in order to clear her he
felt she should tell her entire r story.
He asked that the courtroom be cleared
and she then told a monstrous story-
Dr. Stewart wept when his wife gave
her testimony and denied the charges,
and as far as possible was corrobarated
by the old aunt. Mrs. Stewart's testi
mony could not be supported except
by her own statement. The charges
were of such a nature, however, that
Dr. Pratt, while doubt was not re
moved from his mind as to her insan
ity, receded from, his position to the
extent of being willing to let her go
and see if the disease would not dem
onstrate itself in some other form.
The Rev. Paul Stewart and his wife
are both young people, neither having
attained 40 years of age. ,They -have
been married for ten years and have
had two children, one of whom died
recently. They were educated at the
same school In Ohio and- white he was
afterward at a theological seminary
she taught school. She is the daughter
of Ebenezer Curry, a famous Presby
terian missionary at Alexandria,
Egypt, and a great part of the testi
mony against her was corroborated by
her father's only Bister, who brought
her ud.
After Kyte had seen enough he ar
rested the prowler. Boeddiker, who re
sides in Berkeley, explained to-day that
he had merely been taking a stroll.
He produced his daughter to enlighten
Judge Smith about the suspicious rub
bers. But the Judge did not accept the
story.
A week ago in early morning Detec
tive Kyte saw Boeddiker acting sus
piciously on Thirty-fifth street. The
detective trailed the belated pedestrian,
noticed he wore rubbers, though the
streets were dry as' a bone." From
house to house Boeddiker flitted trying
t6 open windows with a long stick he
carried.
Police Judge Mortimer Smith said
he could not satisfy himself that Boed
diker was beat on innocent business
when be was caught prowling about
residences trying to force open win
dows at midnight. His Honor sug
gested that the noiseless footwear was
very like a footpad's outfit. Boeddiker
was held in $2000 bail.

Margaret Boeddiker, an attractive
young woman, tried hard in the Police
Court to-day to save Henry Boeddiker,
her father, from being held for trial on
a charge of burglary. But her effort
was in vain. Despite her declarations
that her father was accustomed to
wearing rubbers day and night, in dry
as well as rainy weather, other evi
dence was too strong to save the ac
cused man.

The death of Chief Custiniano robs
the Sunol rancheria of one of its best
known characters, and the members of
the tribe now mourn the loss of their
most trusted adviser, for he was still

Mrs. McCarthy's Condition Critical.
Mrs.. Octavia McCarthy, who was
shot by her, husband on September 19,
lies in a critical condition at the Emer

yesterday and cut out by Dr. Stephen
from : its resting place under the right
shoulder blade, where it lodged after
fracturing two ribs in its course
through the woman's body. At the
present time her pulse Is at 104. which,
according to the opinion of the phy
sicians, indicates i fever in a high de
gree ' and , a possible accumulation of
puss produced by the action of the bul
let. A further examination; of her.con

cause of the fever.

State Commissioner Wolff After Rep-

Concern.
Insurance Commissioner Wolff has
obtained 4 from the Justice of the Peace
of Point Richmond a warrant for the
arrest of James N. Kirk on a charge
of fraudulently insuring TL F. G.
Dohrmann of Stege. Dohrmann took
out a policy for $1000 in the Old

The Old Wayne Mutual Life Insur

of a receiver foi some time. This com
pany, which mukes a specialty of in
suring old peopie, has no license to do
business in California and this fact
alone nullifies any policy it may issue
in the State.
Insurance Commissioner Wolff is
tunning unlicensed and illegitimate
insurance concerns to earth and is
collecting evidence against several
concerns in this city.
Jacob Kaufmann was a witness in the
trial of the suit of Max Vizziz against
A. J. Rich & Co. before Justice of the

his fee, refusing to accept the promise
of the plaintiff's attorney to pay after
the case is over. "If I don't get my
pay right here, I don't testify," he de
clared, and then Vizziz came forward
with a dollar in part payment.

In fact, the first we knew of it was
four weeks ago, when application was
made for a license."
The building which has caused such
excitement at the beach is a three
story, frame structure, fronting on tha
boulevard, between K and L streets.
The license Is asked for In the name
of Newton C. Terwilliger. The appli

FRESNO, Sept. 26.â Pretty Miss Sa
die Martin loved Elmer P. Erwin well,
but her father did not fancy the youth
because he was young and only a
butcher boy. Despite Martin pere's ob
jections the young folks became en
gaged. Papa Martin, hoping to nip the
romance in the bud yesterday, told his
daughter that she must choose be^
tween her home and the young man.
Cupid came out the victor and thi3
afternoon the two were married.
When given the alternative by her
father the girl packed her trunk and
went to the young man's mother, who

roof the ceremony was performed that
made the young persons husband and

A three-story building, erected with
funds subscribed by residents of the
picturesque little colony, is now about
completed and it is to be utilized as a
cafe if a license can be procured. A
roadhouse midway between the Cliff
and the resorts in the neighborhood of
Ingleside would make a convenient
stopping place, and this, it is feared
by the antis, is the use which is to be
made of the building, which they sup
posed was to be used as a house for
religious and secular meetings.
Two years ago a club was formed
and incorporated as the Ocean Boule
vard Improvement Club, with the fol
lowing- directors: Felix Irvine. John
McCullom, Paul Jennlcki, Robert Far
rell, A. C. Campbell, Joseph Herzog,
David E. Marchus, Theodore Henn and
Robert Fitzgerald.
It was originally Intended to buy
two lots in the heart of the district at
$450 each, at which price the lots could
then have been obtained. A split
arcse among the directors, however,
when it was proposed to buy boule
vard lots and when the matter was put
to vote five favored the boulevard lots.
The four objecting were Messrs. Ir
vine, McCullom, Jennicki and Marchus.
In explaining the action of the minor
ity, Mr. Marchus said: "The directors
deviated from the original plans. We
wanted a low, roomy building, acces

for meeting purposes. The majority
wished to put up a building to cost

But Henry T. Scott did not open his
lips. He stood quietly by and fum
bled with the charm on his watch
chain like a man is burdened
with something besides a hoe. Mr.
Scott was very thoughtful. It was an
auspicious event in the history of the
great shipyard that has made good
ships and pleasing history for the
American people.
The story was whispered early in
the day that Mr. Scott had formed a
syndicate for the purpose of purchas
ing the works and that he would
henceforth inaugurate a campaign of
ship-building that would cause shears
to dull when bonds were to be clipped.
There was a Ions conference in the
inner office of the Iron Works prior to
the auction, and it Is rumored among
the employes of the establishment that
a compromise was effected by which
it is assured that neither Mr. Scott nor
Mr. Dickie will be disturbed for. fully
one year, at the end of which time It
is likely there will be several changes
in the management of the plant.
The Union Iron Works Is dead.
Long live the Union Iron Works!
The great ship-building plant at the
Potrero has passed out of official exist
ence and has been revived again in
the name of the "reorganized com
pany," which includes a number of
Eastern plants that will at a near date
be incorporated under a general title.
There was only one bidder for the
institution that has turned out vessels
that have won world-renowned rec
ords for efficiency. There was not
even a murmur when the receiver for
the Federal Court of New Jersey
asked, "Gentlemen, are there any
other bidders?"
Every eye turned toward Henry T.
Scott, expecting that a still small
voice would be heard in the impres
sive silence saying:
"I bid three millions."
Mr. Schwab and party will not go
East until to-morrow. He says that the
new organization will represent a capi
talization of $33,000,000 and that all
o? the plants owned by the new com
pany will have plenty of work to dy,
Beyond this he refused to make a
statement. About 70 per cent of the
capital stock of the reorganized com
pany will be controlled by Schwab.
J. C. Campbell, the well-known local
attorney, was present at the sale as
the representative of the New York
Surety Trust Company. This concern
holds a second mortgage, amounting
to " $10,000,000, on the reorganized
company.
Mr. Schwab did not care to discuss
the sale except to say that so far as
the management of the works Is con
cerned there will be few changes, if
any, for a long time to come.
"Whether the corporation will bid on
navy contracts he would not say, but
It is surmised that the local plant will
not be used for this purpose so much

United States Shipbuilding Company's
affairs.
The second parcel, consisting of per
sonal property, was knocked down to
Mr. Pollock in the manner; heretofore
described. The total sum paid, was
$1,700,000, which, was the minimum price
named for : which , the \u25a0 plant should be

BIG SUMS PASS.
"Gentlemen," commenced Receiver
Smith, adjusting his tall hat ana
glancing over the sea of faces, streaked
with the stains of honest toil and grin
ning with an outward appreciation of
the humor of the situation; "gentle
men, it will be necessary for all whtÂ»
wish to bid to deposit for the first
parcel, which is the land, good will,
bonds and such property as has been
itemized in the advertised notice."
There was profound silence for a
few minutes, then F. D. Pollock, at
torney for the reorganization commit
tee, broke it by saying: "On behalf of
the reorganized company I tender a
certified check for $105,000, as â¢ per
requirement of the court, as a deposit
in guarantee."
The receiver then asked if any more
gentlemen in the audience desired to
deposit a similar check and a titter
from the crowd of workmen showed
that 'they were aware of the presence
of a very limited number of milliou
aires.
All eyes turned toward Mr. \ Scott,
but he got behind the corner of tht.
building and could neither be heard
nor seen.
Mr. Pollock, on behalf of George R.
Sheldon of the reorganized committee,
said that he was authorized to bid
$1,400,000 for the plant property as
described in the first parcel. ; No other
gentleman being present who felt like
making an investment that would go
this a few thousands better, the bid
went unchallenged.
AUCTION BEGINS.
said to be in favor of placing all
Government contracts with the yards
that it will control on the Atlantic
side. This allegation does not meet
with denial from the "reorganized
company" â in fact, the principals in
the sale and purchase have little to
say regarding the future use of the
plant except to acknowledge that the
shipyards are to be used "for general
ship-building purposes." The story
of the sale is, in short, that the
United States Ship-building Company,
having been driven out of business by
the Federal courts, has reorganized
under new laws discovered by the
corporation's attorneys, and stands to
day exactly where it stood before the
sales of the combined properties were
ordered, with the exception that the
small stockholder will have been
paid off for his share in the concern
and the combined plants will be oper
ated at will by the "reorganized com
pany."
Henry T. Scott and the present man
agers of the plant will be retained in
their positions for at least a year and
this may be continued indefinitely.
Just what arrangement Mr. Scott has
made with the Schwab interests is a
secret of the one-bid deal that took
place yesterday at noon.
When the noonday whistle sounded
Receiver James Smith Jr., staid and
well dressed, seated himself in a chair
in front of the Twentieth-street office
of the iron works. Charles M.
Schwab, unostentatious as a school
boy, sat opposite the receiver and kept
his head turned from the .crowd of
several hundred that had gathered to
listen to James Deignan, attorney for
the receiver, read the order of sale.
Beside Mr. Schwab was Mr. Scott and
long before the announcement was
made that bids would be accepted the
report was current that Scott had
withdrawn^ and would not put in a
bid. This proved to be true.

The three committees are working
diligently and will make their report to
the Grand Jury on Thursday.
It is plain that crime was committed,
but it seems impossible to ascertain
who committed it. The rosters leave
no clew, nor do any other records.
There was no one at the polls to'make
it a point to scrutinize suspected ille
gal voters for identification. The only
opportunity of prosecution appears to
lie in cases where a citizen happened
to witness the criminal act and was
able to identify the stuffer. Fairfax
"W'heelan has come forward with a

there is a basis for prosecution.
In the Thirty-eighth District about
15 per cent of the votes were fraudu
lent. The Fortv-fourth had a smaller
l>ercentage, according to the results of
the examination to date.
â¢ "The revelations call for drastic
measures and for upheaval of an ocean
of corruption." was the comment of a
grand juror last night.
But with the flood of crime before
them, the grand jurors feel helpless to
cope with it. The fact that the ballot
boxes were fairly crammed with the
Ftuffing stares them in the face, but
how the guJlty can be ferreted out is a
question that the investigators cannot
solve. The forgeries of signatures of
bona fide residents by those who ille
pally voted their names stand out
plainly in the miserable scrawls of
opium fiends and other nondescripts
herded about from precinct to precinct
In the early morning hours of primary

In the Forty-third Assembly District
the number of illegal votes cast was

Charles W'yman was charged in the
Police Court by Fairfax Wheelan.
That the frauds were perpetrated on
bo large a scale has opened the eyes of
the Grand Jury committees to the fact
of reckless disregard for the law and
a criminal negligence on the part of
election officers that is overwhelming.
The gTand Jurors are appalled as
their probe goes deeper into the frauds
of the recent primary election. Exam
ination of the precinct rosters reveals
a delugre of crime. Some of the ballot
boxes had many more illegal votes in
thÂ«Â»m than honest votes, and bo fla
prant was the stuffing that the boards

have aided and abetted the bold viola
tions of the law.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
opened bids for the printing: of the
bonds .â proposed to be issued by the
city "for public improvements. Bids
were submitted \u25a0'by the Union Litho
graphing Company at $6485 for litho

$6850 (lithographs); Galloway Litho

Supervisor Booth said there was
some doubt as to whether the bonds
should be lithographed or engraved on
steel. The bids were then referred to
the joint Committee on Printing and
Public Utilites, which will meet next
Friday at 3 p. m.
Bids for the purchase of the bonds
themselves will be received by the
board next Monday afternoon.
Recorder Godchaux appeared before
the board and again pleaded for relief
from being compelled to dismiss five
of his clerks because Mayor Schmitz
refuses to make the necessary recom
mendation that the clerks be employed
under a specific appropriation for
"index clerks." Godchaux said the
work of the office was crippled and the
public was inconvenienced as a result.
Mayor Schmitz refused to recede
from his stand in refusing to. approve
the appointments of the men. He
said an appropriation was made on a
basis of 8 cents a folio to be paid to
copyists, when, in fact, they had re
ceived but 6 cents, the difference go
ing to pay the index clerks. Schmitz
said favoritism must have been shown,
as the index clerks made $100 a
month, while the copyists earned but
$75. Godchaux explained that the
clerks worked longer thin the copy
ists. After the discussion took a desul
tory turn the board adjourned without
action.

Attorney Frank Schilling yesterday
paid $20 to Dina Smith; his divorce
case client, from whom he was saic
to have withheld money paid by hei
husband as alimony. This compliance
with the alternative -given him by
Judge Hunt resulted in the dismissal
of the action against him of unprofes
sional conduct. Judge Hunt heard the
accusations .last Friday and told thÂ«*
attorney that unless the money was
paid by Monday he would be suspena
ed from thepractice of hia profession.
Schilling held out. to the last minute
and in the meantime applied to the
Supreme Court for a writ of prohibi
tion-: to prevent Judge , Hunt j from
carrying his . order into -effect. ' The
higher court turned the lawyer down.
* The Supreme Court held that the
writ does not . show that' Judge Hunt
exceeded his jurisdiction lri" making the
order; of suspension. The information
thus gleaned cost Schilling $7 50 for
costs.

! GRAVESEND, Sept. 26.â One of the
features of the racing at Gravesend to
day was the easy victory of the fa
vorite, Gunfire, in the overnight han
dicap, in which she was carrying top
weight, 12C pounds, and In which as
I good as even money was offered
against her. Running without blinkers,
the mare was in third place for seven
furlongs; then she moved to the front
very fast and easily deprived the two
year-old, Fleur de Marie, of the lead.
; Gunfire won by several lengths. She
I was ridden with skill by Hildebrand.
1 Though Gunfire ran in the name and
colors of -H. B. Duryea, it is reported
upon excellent authority, that she will
become the property of Clarehce H.
Mackay at the close of this season and
will be mated with Banaster, which
won the Brooklyn and Metropolitan
handicaps, while Gunfire herself, won
the' Metropolitan" and was beaten a
head by her stable mate, Irish Lad,
for the Brooklyn handicap.
It was Gunflre's firBt victory this
year. ;S.he won her last race in 1903 at
the Jamaica track in November last.

Columbtts, 'Ohio, May 20, 1903.
Six years ago I had a severe attack of
Inflammatory Rheumatism. I was laid up
in bed for six months, and the doctors I
had did me no good. They changed med-
icines every week and nothing they pre-
scribed seemed to help me. Finally I be-
gan the use of S. S. S. My knee and elbow
joints were swollen terribly, and at ons
time my joists were so swollen and pain-
ful that I could not close them when
opened. I was so bad that I could not
move knee or foot. I was-getting discour-
aged, you may be sure, when I began a S.
S., but as I saw it was helping me I contin-
ued it, and to-day I am a sound well mam
and have never had a return of the disease
S. S. S. purified my blood and cured me
of this severe case of Rheumatism after
everything else had failed. I have rec-
commended it to others with good re-
sults. . r.h. Chapman.

Whiting objected to a continuance.
The showing made amounted to almost
nothing. If the sureties were sued in
the courts they could put up the de
fendant's death as a defense.
After further discussion the Judge
said the defendant might be dead and
it was only fair to give all parties a
reasonable time to make a thorough
investigation. He granted a continu
ance until Friday.
The Judge thought the showing made
in the affidavits was a remarkable one.
The defendant had been allowed to go
to his death without any interference.
He had been warned that the surf was
dangerous and that there was no life
boat, and yet he had risked his life.
When the A. A. Kratz case was
called in Judge Dunne's court yester
day Assistant District Attorney Whit
ing said it pleased him to announce
that the bond had been found. He
asked that the names of the defendant
and the sureties, V. Kratz, defend
ant's father; Mrs. Rhoda M. White, de
fendant's sister, and Attorney H. D.
Newhouse, be called. The bailiff called
the names at the door of the court
,room, but there was no response.
Whiting then asked that the bond be
declared forfeited and a bench war
rant issued for the arrest of the de
fendant.
\u25a0 Attorney Frank J. Murphy asked for
a continuance of a week and read a
number of affidavits from men em
ployed at the bathhouse at Long Beach
to the effect that the defendant Kratz
shortly before 9 o'clock on the night of
September 15 hired a machine to take a
swim in the surf; that he was 'warned
to be careful, as there was a strong
undertow; that he entered the surf and
was not seen again and that his clothes
were found in the bathing machine. In
view of these affidavits and the fact
that neither the police jior the Sheriff
had received any definite information
from Los Angeles he thought that a
continuance of at least a week should
be granted so that it could be definitely
ascertained whether the defendant wae
dead or alive.
The missing bond of $5000 accepted
by Police Judge Fritz for the release
of A. A. Kratz, held to answer by him
on July 11, 1903, on a charge of felony
embezzlement, has been found. Yester
day morning Warrant and Bond Clerk
Fitzpatrick had occasion to look for an
old bond for the release of W. M.
Kratz. While searching among the void
bonds in custody of Sergeant McDonald
he found the missing document.
A writ of attachment was yesterday served
on the steamer Santa Barbara in a libel Mitt

was found to be on fire. A portion of the

â¢The barkentine Robert Sudden of
this port, now bound from Grays Har

tember 4 by the Pacific Mail-steamship
Barracouta in latitude 23 degrees north
and longitude 110 degrees 15 minutes
wett The stanch little barkentine
had worked herself safely through a
toÂ£gh Mexican coast gale, but came out
of it considerably the worse for wear.
Her foretop n:a*t was blown away, and
Pftrt of the d*>ck load of lumber is now
drifting around in those waters. The
hull was badly straintd and the ves
sel was leaking, but as her cargo of
lumber would prevent her sinking even
if she filled to the rail, all offers of
assistance were declined and the Sud
den, with what sail t?he could spread,
proceeded on her way.

Members of the Friday Club of
Hillsboro, Ohio, ask club women the
world over to assist the movement
they have inaugurated to suppress the
comic valentine in its . present dis
graceful form, which poisons the pure
atmosphere of childhood and teaches
a false conception of humor. The
women of that town have already ap
pealed to all shops dealing in valen
tines and many proprietors have prom
ised co-operation. It seems that most
of the comic valentines are bought by
children, who distribute them among
themselves.
A club woman was recently inter
viewed about the matter and she said
that the pictures were very disgrace
ful and she- could not see why they
are not' forbidden circulation by the
Eoard of Education. She was certain
that St. Valentine's day was not meant
to teach children to make fun of one
another and be spiteful.
"Such valentines teach no one any
good and are of no possible use," said
this woman. "I don't see! why they
were ever put on sale. They ought, at
any rate, not to be sold to children. . I
have see youngsters buy them by; the
dozen, inclose them in envelopes and
send them to their friends. It causes
a great deal of ill-feeling among the
sensitive children and will bear no
good fruits. The sooner that these
valentines are -banished- from I the
stores .. the better. I hope that club
women will take some steps in regard
to the matter."

In the presence of a crowd of passen
gers a new version of "Beauty and the
Beast" was rehearsed on a Third Ave
nue Elevated Railroad car In New York
the other, morning.
On a train was an exceedingly pretty
girl, -tastefully dressed, and with a
wealth of naturally blonde hair. She
occupied a corner of one of the cross
seats and was absorbed in a news
paper. At One Hundred and Twenty
fifth street the Beast entered and took
a seat immediately facing Beauty. He
was evidently of foreign origin.
From the moment he sat down he
never took his gray eyes from the face
of the girl. Although she kept her
eyes fixed on her newspaper it was
evident that Beauty keenly felt the in
sult.
At the Twenty-third street station
Beauty, who had been nervously
squeezing her newspaper into a hard
club, suddenly, arose with cheeks
aflame and struck the Beast across the
face. Again and again did she strike
him, on the right cheek, then on the
left, while he cowered and tried to
ward off the blows with his arms.
Then he, too, rose, crying out, "The
woman's crazy." For an Instant he
seemed about to strike the Beauty, but
every man in the car was on his feet,
and the Beast thought better of it.
Dashing' down the aisle he reached the
open gate, jumped to the station plat
form and sprinted down the stairs to
the street. .

A SPECIAL interest attaches to the coming fifteenth session of
f\ the Trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress, to be held at St.
â¢**\u25a0 Louis during the last week in October, because of the fact that
the States and Territories represented therein are those whose gen
eral interests are* typified by the exposition. The twenty-four com
monwealths of the West whose delegates meet to discuss matters of
common import are those that give to the fair its character as an ex
position of Western progress and Western spirit and this congress
will be the expression of those elements in terms of practical value.
Besides questions of direct local import to the individual States
represented the Congress will busy itself with the investigation of
measures having a broad significance for all sections represented.
Many of the issues of the coming Presidential campaign which have
immediate interest to the whole West are scheduled for considera
tion. The Panama canal, the merchant marine, reclamation of the
semi-arid lands by Government works, the construction of the Pacific
cable and the improvement of the consular service â these issues
touch all of the units represented in the convention. Reciprocity be
tween this country and Canada, Mexico and South American repub
lics will find place in the programme; railroad transportation rates
and steamship facilities will be brought before the delegates ; forest
preservation and the Government control of ranges and grazing lands
also are billed for attention.
The Trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress is able to point to
successful results of its deliberations in the past. As an expression
of the common will of the great West it has had weight with Con
gressional deliberations in the past and has enjoyed the confidence
of all of the constituent States and Territories in these efforts at the
direction of legislative action. The coming session will probably
be as productive of happy results as any of the others.

Age Is not wrinkles and gray hair;
It is shriveled heart, dead hopes and
withered affections, which not time
but our own folly brings us.
If you have grown old in spinster
hood, consider the rascal you may
have escaped marrying.
The best face wash is a smile, and a
cheerful heart will longest defer the
traces of old age.
Up to a certain age soft gray and
pale mauves make a woman look old
er than she Is; after that they" make
her look younger.
Think of the relief of no longer
having to move heaven and earth to
look young and captivating.
Many a woman who can make men
tremble is tyrannized over by a little
piece of glass with quicksilver behind
it.
On the shady side of 35 a woman
can do lots of things she wouldn't
dare to before.
A few women worry so much about
old age that they never get a chance
to enjoy youth.
The woman who constantly scans
the mirror for wrinkles will be cer
tain to discover them soon. â¢
N. J. Hibbard, 75 years of age, Nestor
of New York letter-carriers, who was
appointed a carrier in May, 1867, after
his return from the Civil War, went on
Tuesday to the West End Hotel, In Fort
Washington Park, to deliver a letter
to Mrs. Vincent Waters, says the New
York World. As the veteran carrier
was mounting the stairs to the hotel
Mrs. Waters' fox terrier sprang at him
and imbedded its teejh in the right leg
of his trousers above the knee.
Hibbard Jumped aside as the dog
went for him again, but the animal
dug its teeth into his trousers a sec
ond time, tearing them much and in
flicting a slight flesh wound. The car
rier was angry and the mistress of the
dog mortified.
Mrs. Waters apologized to Hibbard
and begged for permission to sew the
trousers. Hibbard blushed. He wouldn't
think of such a thing!, Mrs. Waters Is
a very attractive-looking woman. She
Insisted that he allow her to sew the
torn uniform, and Hibbard, still blush
ing, yielded. He asked whether he
should retire and send the trousers by
a bellboy, but, Mrs. Waters said that
formality was not necessary; she would
sew up the tear while the trousers
were still on him. So Hibbard knelt
down and Mrs. Waters sewed up -the
trousers neatly. When the Job was

forgave the dog.
Editor The Call: Persistent rumors
have been running that the Citizens'
Alliance intends starting a newspaper,
daily or otherwise, as its organ in San
Francisco. To set such rumors at rest,
I wish to say that the Alliance has not
and never had such Intention. Tha
purpose of the Alliance is to enforce
the law in industrial matters against
all violators; to protect all labor in the
proper pursuit of Its vocation and the
peaceable use of the streets and the
highways on its way to and from its
toil; to protect every business man and
taxpayer in the exercise of his lawful
rights, and the profitable use of hia
property, and to enfranchise all labor,
ncn-union as well as union, and liber
ate every man from bondage to the ar
bitrary will of another and put him in
full enjoyment of civil liberty.
The Alliance is well assured that
these purposes, so necessary to indus
trial prosperity, have the sympathy,
and when needed will have the support
of the press of this city, and It needs
no organ ot its own through which to
support a policy so necessary to the
good of the whole community and so
entirely In line with true Americanism.
Like all organizations, as It has shown
its strength, as it has successfully In
voked the law in defense of the rights
of person and property, as it has curb
ed lawlessness and made the city freer
than it has been for years, parasites
appear who try to get some personal
prestige or profit by soliciting advan
tages In its name. To them must the
origin of such rumors be attributed.
They merely demonstrate that the Al
liance is something that must be reck
oned with, and the public will soon
learn to discriminate between its au
thorized and its pretended representa
tives.
The Alliance is fulfilling Its mission.
It is among the permanent forces nec
essary to the industrial equilibrium
upon which the peace and prosperity
of all must depend. It is in no more
need of a special organ than is the
principle of morality or the spirit of
liberty. HERBERT GEORGE.

rpHE CALL has taken pains, by personal examination, to affirm
the wisdom and necessity of the improvements proposed by the
A bond issue in Oakland. The opposition is on two lines. One of
these consists of vicious misrepresentation of the features of the
proposed Central Park. The various improvement committees of
Oakland have shown the courage of their convictions by providing
free transportation to the park for all citizens who desire to inspect
it, that they might vote "caveat emptor" on the proposition, believing
their eyes rather than the idle tales of malicious parties. It is to be
regretted that the wet weather interfered with this popular inspec
tion, but a large number of doubters have taken advantage of the
opportunity and have had their doubts resolved in favor of the pur
chase.
Upon the structure of prejudice built upon these misrepresenta
tions the second line of opposition begins. This part of the fight
against improvements has been led by Assessor Dalton. His plan
has been to point out, and impress by reiteration, the increase in tax
ation that will be imposed by the bonds. Of course all improve
ments which bring a city up to the modern standard must be paid
for, either by immediate taxation, or in installments by the issue of
bonds. If there be validity in the arguments made by Mr. Dalton,
then there should never be any public improvements in Oakland, be
cause whenever and however made they must be paid for by taxation
of the realty and personalty of the city. There can be no other con
clusion from his argument. If it is good as against the improvements
now proposed, it is good as against any future proposition. If Mr.
Dalton prevail the result will be that Oakland will be set v down and
widely known as a city that refuses to make public improvements and
decides to make no use of its great natural advantages.
Such a reputation means the retrogression of a city. It means
that it decides to stand still, and either that or a less rate of progress
than its rivals show is retrogression. Los Angeles, no more fa
vored by climate than Oakland, and far less favored by location and
scenic attractions, paid a tax of 4 1-2 per cent to secure the class of
improvements which Oakland is asked to reject. Artificial water
parks were made. Where land parks had no variety of surface hills
were made, and Los Angeles has been made one of the most at
tractive cities in the Union, and the cost of it all has come back a
hundredfold to her people. She had her Daltons, but they preached
non-progression in vain, and are to-day participators in the prosperity
that has followed rejection of their advice.
Xo city has ever been improved to death. Frequently the effort
to begin improvement has been opposed as spelling ruin. But it has
spelled life instead of death. When Alexander Shepherd decided
that Washington City should rise out of the mud and be a beautiful
city he was opposed and abused at every step. He became an issue
in national politics, but he persisted until the national capital was
made one of the most beautiful cities of the world. Then, having
fought his battle and enriched those who abused him, he retired with
his personal fortunes ruined, to recoup himself in a foreign country.
Years afterward the city invited him to come as its guest, to be re
ceived en fete and get such an ascription of honor as has never been
given to any other citizen of the District of Columbia, not even ex
cepting Corcoran, the public spirited banker.
The people of Oakland should not be blind to what is going
on. Population is on the march toward the centers of activity on this
coast. , The whole country from San Francisco to Palo Alto is being
made accessible by half-hour trains. It is being cut into town lots
and these are selling at prices that would make a real estate owner
in Oakland turn green with envy. Everything is done to make these
new districts attractive. They are drawing a population of which
Oakland would get an appreciable percentage if she had any drawing
power in the shape of public improvements to so beautify her ad
vantages as to make them irresistible. The same policy of attraction
is in operation north of San Francisco, on the west side of the bay.
While this is going on, does Oakland propose to stand still? Now is
her opportunity, and opportunity usually waits for invitation and,
not getting it, goes on, not to return.
The individual knocker is not a citizen whom others wish to
have for a neighbor. The man who inveighs against his neighbors,
who questions their motives, who is envious of the prosperity of
others, who declares the dishonesty of all men except himself, is not
.welcome in any company. When a 'whole city becomes a knocker
people avoid it'. Oakland marvels that Los Angeles has overtaken
and passed her. When Oakland was the best known city in Califor
nia after San Francisco Los Angeles was an adobe town, dust cov
ered and forlorn. But it soon became a town where knockers were
not heeded, and now has its reward.
We cannot believe that Oakland will refuse"this opportunity.
Her people should remember that the whole scheme of improvements
is a complete structure. One depends for its effect upon all the
others. They should not hack the scheme into pieces, but vote it all,
and not one will regret that he helped to knock the knockers.
VOTE THE OAKLAND BONDS.
"I did not think that with your other
faults you would descend to falsehood.
Smith! He does not look like the kind
of man who would be a friend of your
father. You cannot expect me to be
lieve such a tale."
All through the West she kept Flor
ence under a surveillance that would
have .done credit to a. duenna. When
they returned last week her husband
telephoned that he would bring a friend
to dinner.
With her most gracious manner she
advanced to the library to meet â Mr.
Smith.
"But mother"â the girl began to think
she had carried the Joke far enough â
"he is a friend of father's. Father in
troduced him to me at the depot. His
name is Smith."
"Florence, I am ashamed that a
daughter of mine should descend to
such cheapness. It grieves me. I
never thought you would flirt. Tou
must promise me never to do anything
of the kind again."
For an hour she discoursed upon her
indignation at the thought. Florence
listened dutifully and with apparent
penitence. At Omaha she took care to
walk past the window where her
mother sat after she had managed to
meet Mr. Smith on the platform. An
other lecture lasted as far as Denver.
The climax, came when at Denver
Florence met Mr. Smith at the door of
the car and went out of the station
with him. When she returned her
mother transfixed her with an angry
stare. "Tou are never to speak to that
man again," she announced.
The man was standing within ear
shot.
"Well, yes."
Just then the train began to move.
The girl went Into one car. the 'man
to another. Two hours afterward he
passed through the car where she and
her mother were trying to while away
the tedium of an overland Journey.
The girl smiled and the man nodded.
Her mother saw the latter. She
turned sharply to her daughter.
"Florence." she said, "do you know
that man?"
Why Florence did It she cannot ex
plain. It was the only prospect of fun
In the three days* Journey. "Wellâ not
exactly," she replied.
"Did you bow to him?"
"I'm sorry I'm not. My wife and
daughter are going. My daughter, Mr.
Smith."
"San Francisco," was the reply.
"I'm awfully glad you're going to be
on the train, old man."
A man with a satchel rushed past
them into the next car. Her father
stopped him with a demand to know
where he was going.
She and her daughter . were going
West for the summer. "When they
reached the depot the rain was coming
down in torrents and she immediately
retired to the Pullman. Just five min
utes before the time for the train to
leave her daughter remembered a tele
gram to be sent. Her father had Just
gone to the platform and she hurried
after him.
The mention of the common name of
Smith causes one woman In Chicago
a thrill of horror in the memory of a
very embarrassing situation in which
her haste in jumping to a conclusion
placed her, says the Journal of that
city.

The Rev. E. W. Darst announced
yesterday that he hopes to see the
dedication of tne Christian Church
building, Berkeley, on Sunday, Octo
ber 30.
The Rev. George A. Hough, pastor
of St. Vincent Methodist Episcopal
Church, Los Angeles, has been op
pointed to the California-street Meth
odist Episcopal Church, this city. It
is generally supposed that the Rev. W.
P. Stanley will succeed the Rev. C. O.
Oxnam at Hamilton Methodist Episco
pal Church. Mr. Oxnam is to go
to Hamilton Methodist Episcopal
Church, Los Angelea conference.
The Sunset Christian Church build
ing, now near completion on Tenth
avenue, has been under: the eye of
George D. Tiernan, business agent of
the Wood.. Wire and Metal Lathers'
Union, who discovered that the Rev.
G. Greenwell and J. P. . Dargitz, the
linancial secretary of the church, had
let the contract for plastering to an
"open shop," .
At the meeting of the Ministers' As
sociation of the Christian church de
nomination yesterday afternoon it de
veloped that the Rev. Mr. Greenwell
had been interviewed by the business
agent- of the union, and in reply to
his questions the parson explained
that the 'contract had been made, and
if broken the contractor might come
upon him for damages, and that' in all
honor the contract must be observed.
He explained that the contract had
been let in good faith; that Mr. Dar
gitz, being a new comer \ to the city,
had entered into a contract with the
"open shop" contractor, not knowing
such was the case. Upon- this show
ing, said Mr. Greenwell, the business
agent of the union consented not to
interfere. v
There was a discussion, in which
the ministers were generally opposed
to the idea of being questioned as to
their rights to employ whomsover
they wished. ;
& Dr. Hemphill, pastor of Calvary
Presbyterian Church, delivered an
interesting and picturesque address on
"Australia and Australians." before the

on "The Spiritual Message in the Ser-.

One hundred singers are to compose
the choir at the West Side Christian
Church. Such was the announcement
made by Dr. Walter M. White, the
pastor, at a gathering of ministers of
his denomination yesterday afternoon.
It will be the largest choir in San
Francisco.
Though the- Rev. Mr. Duncan with- ;
drew some time ago from the demoni
nation with which he had been affili
ated all his life, his case was brought
before several. members of the Pres
byterian Ministers' Association yester r
day. No action was taken.
Broken down in health and physi
cally and mentally weary, the Rev.
Kenneth Duncan sought assistance
from a member of the West Side
Christian Church a few days ago and
is consequently receiving the care . lie
sought His life has-been a deplor
able disappointment. \u25a0 \u25a0'
, His friends of the Presbyterian de
nomination, with which he was affili
ated, worked incessantly to benefit
his condition, but apparently to no
purpose.
Speaking to his latest benefactor he
told a pitiful story of his youthful am
bition, of his hopes, and. of the cause
of his ultimate misfortune. He at
tributes all his trouble to the use of
opiates, which originally were 'pre
scribed for him when he^ needed
mental rest. He told how he had
been to sanitarium after sanitarium
without relief.

%g Miss Gannon, Sec y Detroit Amateur l|j
Art Association, tells young women what to
do to avoid pain and suffering caused by
female troubles.
"Deab Mrs. Pdtkhamsâ I can conscientiously recommend LydlaE*
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound to those of my sisters suffering with
female weakness and the troubles "which so often befall women. I suf-
fered for months with general weakness, and felt so weary that I had
.hard work to keep up. I had shooting pains, and was utterly miserable.
In my distress I waÂ« advised to use Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, and it was a red letter day to me when I took the first dose,
for at that time my restoration began. In six weeks I was a changed
woman, perfectly well in every respect. I felt so elated and happy that
I want all women who suffer to get well as I did."â Miss Guila Gannon,
S5& Jones Sl, Detroit, Mich, Secretary Amateur Art Association.
It is clearly shown in this young lady's letter that L.ydla E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will certainly cure the sufferings
of women ; and when one considers that Miss Gannon's letter is
onlyono of the countless hundreds which wo are continually
publishing- in the newspapers of this country, the great virtue of Mrs. Pink-
ham's medicine must be admitted by all ; and for the absolute cure of all kinds
of female ills no substitute can possibly take its place. Women should bear
this important fact in mind when they go into a drug store, and be sure not
to accept anything 1 that is claimed to be " just as good " as Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound, for no other medicine for female ills has
made so many actual cures.
\ .
How Another Sufferer Was Cured.
** Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â I cannot praise your wonderful remedies
enough, for they have done me more good than all the doctors I have
had. For the last eight years and more I suffered with female troubles,
was very weak, could not do my housework, also had nervous pros-
tfation. Some days I would remain unconscious for a jvhole day and
night My neighbors thought I could never recover, but, thanks to
your medicine, I now feel like a different woman.
" I feel very grateful to you and will recommend Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound to alL It has now been four years since
I had the last spell of nervous prostration. I only weighed ninety-
eight pounds at that time ; now I weigh one hundred and twenty-three.
"I % consider your Vegetable Compound the finest remedy made.
Thanking you manv times for the benefit I received from your medicine,
I remain, Yours truly, Mrs. J. IL Farmer, 2809 Elliott Ave., St. Louis, Mo."
Remember Mrs. Pinkham's advice is free and all sick women
are foolish if they do not ask for it. She speaks from the widest
experience, and has helped multitudes of women.
fTnft'i FORFEIT If we cannot forthwith prodnce the original letters and signatures of
Vn||lÂ£*l itbove tetumouials, which will prore their &bso!nte genuineness.

DECIDES FOR THE MINERS.
CHICAGO, Sept 26.â Nine thousand
men returned to work* without union
regulations of any sort to-day when
the three Chicago branches of the In
ternational Harvester Works and the
Pullman Company reopened their shops
after a shut-down of two weeks. The
men not only returned to their former
places \u25a0 as Individuals, but they also
agreed to reductions in -pay of 10 to 20
per cent.
Before the shut-down the Inter
national Harvester Works recognized
the labor unions, but with the an
nouncement of a resumption of work
to-day came the statement that the
company would not renew Its agree
ment with the trades unions and that
the plants would be operated on a basis
of fifty-seven and one-half hours per
week instead of fifty-four, with no in
crease in wages.
The case of the employes of the Pull
man Company is different from that of
the Harvester Company, inasmuch as
the Pullman Company has ignored all
trades unions since the strike in their
plant in 1834. The Pullman Company
announced to-day that it would reopen
its shops, but at a wage reduction of
10 to 20 per cent.
Less than two thousand workers
were given their former positions, but
thtese men willingly accepted the de
crease in pay, and several thousand of
the former employes left the yards of
the company to-night bitterly disap
pointed because they could not return
to work, even at the reduction in
wages.

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26.
Professor Jaffa attributes this state
of affairs to California's legislators,
who, although possessed of the full
est knowledge of the State's resources,
still have failed to appreciate, to the
extent that the legislators of other
States have done, the fact that the
foundation of agricultural prosperity
in the development of the science of
farming.
"These comparisons have been made
on the basis of buildings only. The
Legislature of Wisconsin has gener
ously supplied funds for buildings and
in addition has made appropriations
for investigations and the purchase of
large tracts of land, which are abso
lutely Indispensable to the best meth
ods of agricultural teaching."
Figures published at the University
of California to-day by Professor M.
E. Jaffa of the College of Agriculture
show that, as compared with other
States, California spends a beggarly
sum on its agricultural college, ana
this In the face of the fact that Cali
fornia Is the greatest agricultural State
in the Union. Here is what Professor
Jaffa says, under the caption, "Are
Comparisons Odious?"
"During the last twenty-flve years
Wisconsin has spent in the neighbor
hood of $300,000 for buildings for the
agricultural department on Its uni
versity campus. The amount similarly
spent at Berkeley is considerably less
than $50,000, of which $10,000 was
used, not for additional accommoda
tions, but to replace the building de
stroyed by fire. It is very well known
to all who have traveled or kept in
touch with agricultural affairs that in
respect to buildings California is fai
behind such commonwealths as Minne
sota, Illinois, Iowa, Ohio and many
other States that are smaller and their
agricultural * interests infinitely less
varied.

Chicago was 3%c lower on the day. ThÂ»
wires of E. F. Hutton & Co. said: "Wheat
took its tone wholly from the large, primary
receipts. While there waa again a good cash
business In all the markets, it was no better
than heretofore, and possibly a little less.
Traders, however, seem to take the view that
the movement Is likely to continue large for
some time to come and that with only a mod
erate milling demand this demand is likely
to get filled up atid stocks are likely to ac
cumulate quite rapidly. This view has with
drawn some of the best recent buyers from the
market, and a good many are disposed to
hold oft for awhile. Threshing returns in the
Northwest are also in many cases better than
had been expected. Cables only partiallly fol
lowed Saturday's advance here and anyhow
cables are not much of a feature."
In this market futures were active and lc

grain was unchanged.

CHICAGO, Sept. 26. â A break of 4 cents a
bushel in the price of wheat occurred here
to-day. The decline was due to general liqui
dation and to the execution of numerous
stop-loss orders. Surprisingly heavy primary
receipts e<jfotributed to the weakness. The mar
ket closed at almost the lowest point of the
day the December option ehowlng a net loss
of 3%@3%c. Corn Is off vi'Slc. Oats are
down %c. Provisions are up 2%c to 10c.
At the start the market showed a fair degree
of firmness the December option being %@}4c
to %(t%c higher at $1 14% to $1 14%. Initial
quotation* on May were a shade lower * to a
shade higher at $1 15V4 to $1 15%. To a large
extent the firm opening was due to the strength
of foreign grain markets, wheat price* at Liv
erpool being up:,nearly;a penny., -Immediately
after the opening two or three big operators
began to sell out lines. of long wheat. .This
was followed by similar action on the part of
the smaller holders. As a result prices started
on the down grade, the declining tendency
continuing throughout the entire session. Weak
ening influences early in the day were liberal
arrivals in the Northwest and expectations for
still larger receipts. As prices declined, many
stop-loss orders were reached, and the expec
tation of these orders added to the weakness.
Unexpectedly heavy arrivals in the Southwest
and an increase of nearly 2,000,000 bushels
in the visible supply were late 'bear factors.
The low point of the day was reached just
before the close, when December sold at
$1 10%, a decline of 4 cents from the opening
high price. At the same time May sold at
$1 11%. Sentiment at the close was extremely
weak, final quotations on December being at
$1 10%. May closed at $1 11%. Clearances
of wheat arid flour were equal to 26,800 bush
els. The amount on passage decreased 720,000
bushels and the visible supply increased
1,193,000 bushels. Primary receipts were
1,890,700 bushels, compared with 1,167,200 bush
els a year ago. Minneapolis, Duluth and Chi
cago reported receipts of 1155 cars, against
1047 cars last week and 964 a year ago.
Continued warm weather throughout the
West had a weakening influence on the corn
market early In the day, and later the severe
break in wheat prices added to the depres
sion.
The market closed at almost the lowest point
of the day. December opened a shade to %@
%o lower at 50%@51%c, sold off to 50%@
50%c and closed at 50Hc Local receipts were
470 cars, with C4 of contract grade.
Oats were weak, In sympathy with other
grains. December opened %@V4c higher at
31%c to 31%c, sold to 30%c and closed at
30Â»4c Local receipts were 236 cars.
In spite of the weakness In corn, the pro
vision market was firm. Small receipts of
hogs and higher prices at tha yards were the
bull factors. There was evidence of buying
on a fair scale by packers. Selling was mainly
in the way of profit-taking. At the close Jan
uary pork was up 10c to $11 35. Lard waa
up 7%c at $7 43. \u25a0\u25a0 Ribs closed at a gain of
2%<JT5c at $0 90@6 02%.
Estimated receipts to-morrow â Wheat, 102
cars: corn. Â«23 cars; oats, a35 cars; hosts

STOCKSâ Bullish aentiment on the general
ttÂ«ck market was stimulated very materially
ui-day by the eharp break of nearly .four
â¢.er.vs iri the price of wheat in Chicago and
ever three cents here and corn selling off
a cent, with central liquidation and much
. nior* . rivorab> weather conditions and bet
ter crop reports tbe chief features causing these
rnmiruens. The outlook is favorable for con-
Cv.uoJ sood trading and we wculd favor pur
chase* of any of the good railroad stocks and
. U such 'were judiciously made and held for
a reasonable length of time we believe they
â¢;l.I. ithow moderate profitai We would ad
w*e, however, against ever trading, as we do
not expect to ete any big rise in prices from
this level until the corn and cotton crops
njive passed beyond the stage of serious frost
(Jamas:*. The buying of Â«tocks continues bet
ter than the Bellinp. There is very little pres
sure tratn ion* Â«tockÂ« .and \-ery little ln_ the
situation that we can see to make any. There
19 an improving tendency to general business
and the operative forces are. we think, of a
â¢ h&racter that will increase this tendency. The
agricultural community everywhere is pros
c l>erou*; even where the farmers have but
half a crop of wheat they are realizing as
much money for it as they would fcr a big
crop. There ts nothing in the financial eltu
atioa ir. dr.y quarter to threaten or disturb
the market. Stocks etlll offer an inviting in
vestment to the millions of idle money. We
see nothing to change the tendency.
COTTON â The reaction in the ccttoa market
to-day was not at all surprising in view of
50 much bullish talk and open manipulation
ry tie large bull interests which marked the
cloee of trading at the end of last week, and
the failing eff in the urgent demand for epot
cotton from the fact that ail arrangements
for meeting deliveries on September contracts
have, been completed, and the disposition of
the inajority of the trading element here to re
Â»iÂ£t cr antagonize any aggressiveness or as-
Munption to the bull leadership by the oper
ator Beet active in last winter's boom. The
more conservative traders do not look for any
big. decline at present, as spot markets ccn
t:nae too strong and the crop situation and
outlook are Â«iil too uncertain to warrant
heavy selling at this time of the year. Most
r-f them are bearish and sell on every bulge,
c tst ere quick to take profits on declines and
will continue to pureue this policy as long a*
the Cry goods market continues quiet aad
Trosrt holds off.
COFFEE â The coffee market was dull and
weak, this being attributed principally to lack
of demand end some Felling pressure, and
also to the issuance cf some 10,000 bags en Oc
tober contract. The trading was not broad
enough to give an idea of the general trend
cf the market, but local sentiment Is still
bullish and the majority of traders still look
lor higher prices.

K1EW YORK. Sept. 26.â Both strength and
I breadth were manifested in the dealings In
I stocks to-day and the market as a whole rep
, resented clearly a revival from the drooping
; tendency of the latter part of last week. The
I strength and activity were not so much con
, gestcd in special stocks as recently and the
: market had a certain appearance of quiet for
: the greater part of the day. This was ac
; counted for by the fact that the opening prices
[ represented a large part of the pains and
( prices of the prominent stocks were practl
| Citlly motionless for a long time after the
I opening. Less prominent stocks were sought
: out meanwhile, to bring them up to a levei
proportionate with the leaders. There was no
alarming news concerning the crops and price*
I in the commodity markets moved downward.
I This was a reassuring influence on the whole
list. Every day which paases without damage
, adds materially to the feeling of security over
' the crops, owing to the near approach of the
, period of maturing of the corn crop. The
! leader of the market in point of activity was
j United States Steel preferred, and its strength
) was of sympathetic advantage to the general
list. The professed motive for the buying was
I a conviction that the full dividend on the
preferred stock for the current quarter is
sure to be disbursed. No authority could be
cited for this assumption. The independent
i steel stocks were strong In sympathy. The
j news from the trade offered nothing to ex
plain the strength of this group. Officials of
trunk lines of railroads admitted some dls-
I appointment at the apparent halt In the ex
1 r^ns-ion of freight traffic, which was attributed
j to the eff*;t of the crop uncertainty on trade,
and to thÂ« slow revival in the steel trade.
Western railroad offlcials expressed disagree
ment with the low estimates of the corn crop
current in Wall street last week, but they
also admitted the retarding effect on business
until the crcp outlook is more definitely as
sured. There was Â«I11 an Important influence
on sentiment by the assertions of a large ac
cumulation of Atchiwn in the interest of
Union Pacific, but more was heard of question
ings of the scope of the plan of accumula
tion. The indications o< progress making in
the working out of the problem of ultimate
I control and harmonization of the transconti
j nental railroad situation was accepted as im
j pcrtant and made that whole group conspic
uous in the market.. Gross earnings of rail
roads fo*r the third week of September were
received in quite large number and were
generally satisfactory to holders of securi
ties. Atchison was doubtless helped by the
preliminary circulation of its favorable an
nual report, as well as by reports of accumula
tion of the stock for Union Pacific The
profit taking made some impression on prices
in the last half hour, when a number of low
priced railroad stocks were pushed upward
to cover tne selling. There was no change
in the rates of interest, but Sterling exchange
was firmer and the price of gold in London
was lowered, indicating lew apprehension of
i a demand for gold in that center. \u25a0
Bonds were firm. Total pales, par value,

The revival of "The Danltes" at the

unqualified success. The stirring drama
of the days of the pioneers, particularly
of j the times when the . "destroying

the caravans of the geld seekers, has
lost none of its power to thrill and
charm. The large audience that saw
the production by the clever Central
company $hpwed'as much interest and
enthusiasm as if the dramatic adapta
tion from Joaquin Miller's : famous
story were being witnessed for the first
time. The play is admirably mounted
and staged and the people of the cast
uniformly merit commendation for
their pleasing efforts. Seldom has the
house put forth a more acceptable and
worthy attraction. In the character of
"Sandy" McGee, the sturdy, big-hearted
miner, Herschel Mayall gave a splendid

committed on April 12, 1903. and the
complaint against Katzauer alleged
that he received the goods "on or be

White Whittlesey's breezy personality
finds congenial material in the charac
ter of Robert Clay, railroad engineer

has disappointed all theater-goers by
causing his hero to talk much and to

a personation that affords Virginia
Brissac ample scope to display her
clever work as an ingenue, and she
did not neglect It. There is hardly a
place in the play that could allow
Eugenie Thais Lawton scope for her
talent, but the rather small part of
Madame Alvarez gives her an oppor
tunity to exhibit two or three very
becoming gowns and to thrill the
house with a very intense love scene

less exciting third act. Mr. Hilliard's

disclosed that the shrimps fed from the

"The deadly nature of shrimps
caught off Butchertown is such that
their sale should be at once prohibited."

Deputy Health Officer Levy to send a

Another fraud order affecting con
cerns In this city was issued yester
day by Postmaster Fisk by order of
the Postmaster General. The con
cerns which have thus been denounc
ed as unlawful are the American Mu
tual Investment Company and the
American Mercantile Company and
their officers and agents. These com
panies are conducting business on a
similar plan to those against which
fraud orders have beet* already la
sued. They offer an extraordinary
rate of Interest to their investors.
The American Mercantile Company
named in the order issued yesterday is
a tontine diamond concern, formerly
doing business in the Parrott building
and recently in the Grant building, at
Seventh and Market streets. Its busi
ness was taken over a short time ago
by the American Mutual Inrestment
Company, so that yesterday's order ap
plies really to only one concern.
Postofflce Inspector O'Connell called
attention last night to the fact that
the order had no reference to the
American Mercantile Company of 420
Battery street. This reputable cor
poration is engaged in the importation
of foreign wines, oils and conserves
and has no get-rich-qulck schemes for
public consumption. .-

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
The comedy comes inÂ» in the atti
tude of the wonderful American hero,
Richard Hamilton, who, in the first
act, disguises himself as, the Russian
heroine's brother and is confidingly
accepted as such by the whole popula
tion of the play. Hamilton lets him
self In for all sorts of things by reason
of the disgulse-rfrom intrigue, nihil
ism, to the name. of Alexis Petrovitch.
Accept the possibility of the disguise,
however, and . you will have a good
time with "By Right of Sword." In
deed one can simply wallow In the con
fusion of the "skis" and "vitches" by
the American, who walks away with
all the honors of war while smoking a
cigar. He saves the life of the Czar
and "jollies" the villain with equal ur
banity. Even the solemn Judge, who
i3 to sentence him to death, is poked
in the ribs with his infinite jest.
There is plenty of other fun and a
thrill or two. The scene In the ob
servatory, where the imported German
anarchist turns on an electric switch
to derail the Czar's train, is excellent
good melodrama. Nor do I remember
a prettier fight than the sword play of
the second act. But there is not a dull
moment in the comedy. If the villain
is not on deck there is the adventuress,
both of the best old kind, with secret
police, military gentlemen, a rattling
good comedy valet, a plausible an
archist, a sugar and spice ingenue, all
doing things to amuse. And the
scenery is worthy of the somewhat
chromographic splendor of the play.
Ralph Stuart, who is pleasantly re
membered from Republic days, , is the
hero. -He. will be recalled as more of
the . romantic actor than a comedian,
and though he plays his part here with
spirit and notable sang-froid, his
comedy, from a not entire tempera
mental accord with the genre, be
comes sometimes slightly farcical. I
do not think, for example, that the
playrights three. Mrs.- Charles Dore
mus. Leonidas Westervelt and A. W.
Marchmont, would object to Mr.
Stuart's showing a slight seriousness
in the courtroom scene. The entire ab
sence of it conduces to. a not wholly
desirable mirth. But it is a dashing
and virile impersonation and Mr.
Stuart makes a very personable picture
and his fencing scene is worth s^fing
in itself.
At last the new thing in plays, the
comedy Russian, or rather 'the Rus
sian in comedy. He is appearing in
"By Right of Sword," a melodramatic
comedy presented by Ralph Stuart at
the California this week. One finds the
new order of things rather refresh
ing, if somewhat irreverent. Neither
does one mind its being not wholly
credible. There is a shy sort of sat
isfaction, a vicarious revenge on the
terrible Tartar, of the snow-soaked
drama we have so long- sat under, in
"By Right of Sword." Not that there
is not a hint of Siberia among the per
ils of the hero, a lively duel, and frank
fuss about some secret police machina
tions. But these things wear a rather
good natured than strenuous air. ex
cept in the frustration of the very up
to-date and thrilling attempt upon the
Czar's life.

Supervisor Brandenstein said
The Board of Supervisors yesterday,
acting on the recommendation of the
Finance Committee, took steps to re
fund the special taxes of 13 cents levied
two years agro for new schools and a
hospital since declared invalid by the
Supreme Court. Of the taxes collected
nbout 5340.000 was paid under formal
protest whale $240,000 was paid without
protest. The board adopted ihe fol
lowing resolution on the subject rela
tive to the suits instituted by taxpay
ers for the recovery of the taxes paid:
ResolvfdL That the City Attorney be and
he is hT*by authorized and directed to per
sJt Judgment to be taken by stipulation with
out costs ot tuit or interest on the amount
claimed, against the City and County of San
Francisco, upon presentation to him. of the
original tax receipt of the Tax Collector of
thic city and county for the amount allowed,
or a. duplicate thereof istued by said Tax
Collector, in the event of the loss or de
struction of such tax receipt in favor of the
plalntlffK in the actions.
E. P. E. Troy appeared before the
committee with a long list of ques
tions which he desired the United
Railroads to answer. Troy alleged that
the company was turning from Post
into Kearny and from Eighth avenue
into D street without having permits
or franchises for the same. The com
mittee decided to take up the matter
next Thursday at 11 a. m.
Replying to Brandenstein's charge
that the petition had not been made in
good faith, "School Director Altmann
said that the matter had been brought
to the attention of his board by the
principal of the Polytechnic High
School, who said that white pupils had
to be excluded from work at the lathes
because of the previous enrollment of
Japanese pupils.
Roncovieri produced a number of
bills for gas furnished the public
schools, which he said his board had
held up because they were double what
the city was paying for gas in other
departments. The committee directed
the appearance of the gas company's
representatives to explain the alleged
excessive charges.
School Director Boyle submitted a
statement showing that there are 2S8
Japanese, 66 Chinese and 2 Korean pu
pils attending the public schools. The
enrollment at the Chinese school is 161.
In the high schools are 51 Japanese
pupils.
"I am weary of this humbug."
"You can apply the gag-rule if you
choose," said Roncovieri Indignantly.
"With you rests the responsibility of
any accidents in outhouses such as
happened in the East a few days ago,
or from bad results owing to unsani
tary conditions. If you had allowed
us enough money last June we would
not be here to-day asking you for ad
ditional funds."
D'Ancona said that the board could
not stand for any possibility of an ac
cident, but thought all formalities
should be waived and. money allowed
from the urgent necessity fund to re
pair the flooring in schoolhouses so as
to prevent children from falling into
the vaults. Roncovieri thought it
would be a waste of money to patch
the floors up, as it would cost $85,000
to repair ' the vaults. It was finally
agreed that the School Directors secure
estimates of the cost of doing such re
pairs as would prevent accidents.
"It is ridiculous to send a communi
cation of this kind to the Supervisors,"
said D'Ancona, "as the funds were all
apportioned last June and the only
fund available now is the urgent ne
cessity fund, which is being rapidly
exhausted. We have no authority to
prescribe where children shall- be edu
cated, and I move that the Board of
Supervisors be advised that it has no
authority to provide for the establish
ment of separate schools for Japanese
children."
President Roncovleri of the Board of
Education said he wanted to correct
some mlsstatements made by D'Anco
na, but he had not proceeded very far
when Brandenstein said:
D'Ancona said the petition of the
School Board was similar in character
to the barricading of the Phelan pave
ment by the Board of Works and was
done for political effect.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday denied the petition of the
Board of Education that funds be pro
vided for the establishment of an in
dependent school for Japanese pupils.
Several Japanese, with the members
of the School Board, were present at
the meeting.
The committee was not long in de
ciding that the Supervisors were pow
erless at this time to establish the
separate school, claiming that the mat
ter rested with the Board of Educa
tion.

Hot Box Suey, a forlorn looking Chi
nese, denied that he was attempting to
cc-mmit arson when a policeman caught
him in the act of starting a bonfire
upon a wooden floor .and against a
wooden partition in a Washington
street rookery. His defense, as filtered
through an interpreter, was to the ef
fect that several years ago, while em
ployed at an Alaska salmon fishery, he
acquired a cold which has clung to
him ever since, and that it was with
intent to mellow his chronic chill, and
with no incendiary motive, that he
made the blaze which might have, re
sulted in the destruction of Chinatown
if it had not been quenched in Its in
cipiency. Judge Mogan opined that
prison would be a good place for Hot
Box Suey to nurse his cold, and prom
ised to fix the term to-day.
"At the same time, your Honor,"
said the Acting Chief to 1 Judge Cab
aniss. "I would like to have the public
notified through the press that only
in case of fire or a collision between
trains or street cars is it legal to call
out the Fire Department. Many; good
citizens apparently labor under the de
lusion that the department may be
summoned to serve as a pumping corps
in the event of flood, and I would like
to have them understand that they
are mistaken as to the scope of the de
partment's functions."
The case against Mr. Meyerfleld was
then dismissed.
Acting Fire Chief Dougherty, who
had Herbert G. W. Meyerfield arrested
for summoning the department to
pump out a flooded cellar, accepted the
defendant's plea that neither mischief
nor malice prompted the turning in of
the alarm. â¢
Grace McNaughton also settled a
case out of court and then sent notifi
cation to Judge Conlan that she would
like to have him order the delivery to
a pawnbroker of a certain ring, the
possession of which was in dispute.
The Judge, however, informed the
young woman's attorney that the ring
would not be given up to anybody un
till she appeared in person and ex
plained what she meant by utilizing the
court as an intimidatory machine.
After dismissing the case of the
Auto Livery Company against L. J.
Crowell, who was charged with having
refused to pay $25 \u25a0 automobile hire,
Judge Mogan. expressed regret that
Max Rosenfeld. the chief complainant,
was not in court to hear something,
concerning himself.
"Several months ago," said his
Honor, "this man Rosenfeld, as fore
man of the Grand Jury, took occa
sion to censure this court, alleging
that I dismissed too many cases with
out considering their merits or consult
ing the public welfare. His comments
were published in two newspapers, and
I went -before the Grand Jury and re
futed them and challenged him -to sub
stantiate a single one of his statements.
That challenge was never taken up,
and I heard no more of Mr. Rosenfeld
until, last ..Thursday, when he, .ap
proached this bench and requested that
I dismiss the case in which he as man
ager of th.e Auto Livery Company was
complainant and L. J. Crowell the de
fendant. He stated that as Mr. Grow
ell's mother had paid the 525 he had no
further desire to press the case. In
other words, Mr. ' Rosenfeld asked me
to do the very thing which he had cen
sured me far doing while he was fore
man of the Grand Jury. He tried to
use this court as a collection agency.
In dismissing this case I want to have
It understood that my action is, not
pompted by Mr. Rosenfeld's appeal,
but because I consider the defendant a
decent gentleman who resented what
he sincerely regarded as an attempt to
extort."
After the children of Lawrence Mur
phy, cattle buyer, had quarreled with
the offspring of Daniel J. Leahy, con
tractor, the mother oft the Murphy
youngsters and the maternal relative
of- the Leahy Juveniles clashed and
then the two husbands and fathers
mixed In. It was an interfamily con
flict when the arrests were made.
Mr. Leahy testified before Police
Judge Cabaniss that Mr. Murphy
struck him on the head with a slung
shot, but. Mr. Murphy averred that his
only weapons were his rists. He also
insinuated that he would not consider
himself much of a man if he felt it
necessary to resort to the use of dead
ly, weapons in order to defeat Mr.
Leahy. The insinuation brought ' a
smile of admiring approval to the
countenance of Mrs. Murphy, but Mrs.
Leahy did not seem to relish it, nor
did it serve to traifquilize the acerbi
tous facial expression of Mr: Leahy.
Each family, accused the other of
having provoked and pressed the fight
and the testimony was so very con
flicting that the Judge candidly con
fessed inability to ascertain with any
degree of exactness where the primal
responsibility rested.. Mr. Murphy's
story was the clearest. He was "enjoy
ing a post-prandial snooze, he said, at
his home, 3124 Twenty-fifth street,
when sounds of \u25a0 warfare wafted
through an open window and awaken
ed him. Identifying- some of the an
gered voices as belonging to his house
hold, he leaped from his couch and,
without taking time to don â¢ either
shoes or coat, flew to the scene of
strife. There he found his progeny
holding its own against the - Leahy
ditto, but opposing his better half were
both Mr. and Mrs. Leahy. "What else
could any man in his place do than the
thing he did? He smote Mr. Leahy,
but not with a slungshot. The accusa
tion that his hand contained aught but
fingers when it i landed upon' Mr.
Leahy's . head only served to convict
the accuser of malice most unscrupu
lous. Would the court kindly remem
ber that? ',-
Without promising to remember any
thing, the court dismissed the case.
