BURBANK GIVES HIS VIEWS ON CHILD CULTURE
We in America form a nation with the bloods of half the peoples of the* world wit Kin our veins. We are more-crossed than any pother nation- in the history of;the world, and here we meet
the same results that are always seen in a much crossed race of plants, all the worst as well as allthe best qualities of each ;arcbirougrit^ right here is where selective
environment counts. All the necessary crossing has ibeen done, andnow comes the work o^ the finest human race
which has ever been known. It is perhaps this country which will produce that race. Many years will pass before the finish; work >isj attainc^d, but it is, sure to* come. The characteristics peoples
that make up this nation will show in the composite with many of thc-evil characteristics removed, and the : finished product will' fe

IN AMERICA
At the complimentary dinner given to
Luther Burbank by the California State
Board Â©f Trade, at the Palace Hole! last
ni*ht, the eminent horticulturist made, a
remarkable speech.
For the first time in his career be- rave
his views on the training of children. To
W* imputation as a specialist_wltji_j>lants
â¢.mi KewÂ«rK he added laurels as an ex
pounder of heredity and environment . as
affecting child Hit, which he thinks ts
"HKire susceptible than anything in the
world to influence." -* ;-*_V '-:-.
Every line of the speech is destined to
be rezntmbtred and discussed .far and
â¢wide, for the conclusions are clear cut
an<j Â«riicingly' expressed. He spoke as
to.lows:
\u25a0"Mr. President and my highly esteemed
but deluded friends â deluded if you expect
Luther Eurbark to exhibit that ready fa
cility In handling the English language
which thest- gentlemen who have been
chosen to address you possess:
MIM)> HIS OWN" BUSIA'KSS.
'"Eitr since I came to this curious world
I have steadily, on -.i occasions, tried to
mind ay own business and especially to
escape publicity, but alas, here 1 am
once mere dragged out Into the lime light.
If you came hert expecting me to help
on the fireworks you* have my sympathy,
but I congratulate you on the good judg
ment exhibited in your choice of the gen
tlemen who have spoken and those who
are yet to address you. It was a fine bit
cf humor to .place me in the midst of
â¢uch a galaxy of orators, and it must be
very amusing to you, but this part of the
performance i E no joke to this victim of
Untoward circumstances. '
"I was brought up in a family like
raost of you and my eyes . have always
been wide open when something appeared
which promised to be useful to myself or
ethers. Among other things flowers and
children never escape my notice, but chil
dren respond to 10.000 subtle influences
which leave no more impression on a
plant than they would on a sphinx. You
naay say, 'well, what do you know about
children?" Anything - love, we study
and I have observed that in searching for
good teachers you do not choose parents
cf large families on account of their su
perior knowledge of children. You gener
*!Iy select those who have no families of
their own. do ycu not? Therefore, as one
cf the latter class, I claim the prii-iiege
cf stating a word for the helpless little
victims.
"Borne time ago I accorded a St. Louis
clergyman a five-minute Interview, the re
euit of which Is that I have been plunged
into the arena of child culture, and fan- ''
tastic words have been put In my mouth
â¢which 1 were never uttered, especially in
placing environment bo far above hered
ity. They are on the average exactly
equal, in fact, life is a fluctuating bal
ances between these two lines of energy
Eornetinws one holds the reins, somel
times the other, but both are always In
action where there is life.
"On this subject even many alleged sci
entists seem very much muddied, and how
can those who do not make it a special
Â«tudy be expected to have well-deflned
ideas on it?
3IE.V PART OF HUMAN* TREE.
"Biologically considered, each human
being is only an inside expression of the
great tre* of human life, and what*l
Â«hall cay to you this evening Is in the be
lief that any subject Is better understood
when seen from several slightly different
points of view.
"The great questions at stake are.
Which has the more influence In building
the life of a child, heredity or environ"
ment? And. Are acquired character? in
herited? My own observations prove ;hat
all characters that' are Inherited "iave
ence been acquired, and that heredity is
onlr the sum of all these past environ
ments, which If . impressed on the hered
ity long and strong enough in any specific
direction will become a part of heredlty
iuelf. and this new heredity, already
\u25a0lightly -changed by" these late" environ
ments, will have to meet new environ
ments as before, which will rby repetition
become fixed . in the ever new and con
stantly, fluctuating heredity.

The representative people of the State
of California were gathered in large num
bers at the festal board In honor of Mr.
Burbank. It was an unusual gathering,
numbering as it did distinguished men
from every walk'in life, who came from
all parts cf the State to pay homage to
the man of genius.
The banquet hall was decked with a
gorgeous display of some of the beautiful
emblems of the floral world that owe
their origin to the honored guest of the
evening. General X. P. Chipman was
chairman and W. H. Mil's was toast
master. Before beginning the set pro
gramme of the evening notes of regret
end congratulatory expressions were read
from Judge Angellptti, Judge de Haven,
General Goodman, Edward F. Adams, J.
A. j Pilcher, Frank Higglns and H. B.
Curley, the secretary of the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Burbank re
reived the honors heaped upon him with
that f=ame modesty of demeanor that has
always characterized his life and actions.
After partaking of a sumptuous repast
General Chipman began the speech
making. He raid in part:
CHAIRMAN TALKS.
Judge N. P. Chipman, president of the
California State Board of Trade, said in
part:
"I feel much relieved by the arrange
ment that has devolved upon Wiiliam
H. Mills the duties of toastmaster, anS
to make the principal address in intro
ducing our distinguished guest. I will,
however, be permitted to have your, at
tention for a brief word."
"In looking over the names of the
men who have come here to lay at the
feet of Â«3t]-ei Burbank their ' tribute
of tTpreclatioii of the great work he"
has- done and is still doing, to advance
the- importance of horticulture, I think
I can assure him that they represe-it
the best citizenship of this common
tvealth. They might be more;numerous,
hut could not" be. more" truly represent
ative. .: ' ; . .
"And. my friends, there is every-rea
son- why this should be so.* Many of
Mr Burbank's achievements have be
conu- n part of that Industry which has
niudo California famous throughout the
civ!::7cd globe and that has taken a^d
will tver hold first place among 'the

"No one can now dispute the fact

"It would afford me' great pleasure
to speak in some detail of Mr.'iÃur
banks unselfish work for the benefit'of
his fellow-man and of the consecra
tion of his whole soul to that work.'M
should like to tell you of the many evi

TO ASTM-v-jTER EXrLAIXS.
Following General Chip'man, . ; Mr.
Mills spoke as follows: â¢\u25a0 : â¢.\u25a0\u25a0"-,
"Gentlemen: It was a Roman maxim
that 'men do most resemble . the gods
when they create states.' To our mod
ern conception the work of'mari is most
in consonance with the will of the Crea
tor when he augments the life-bearing
stage of the earth. To make the earth
more fruitful and its bloom more radiant
has betn part of the religious life of the
â¢ honored guest of the evening. ' .;
"We will- not attempt , to, recount/the
achievements of Mr. Burbank. That
would be turning the accomplishment of
years Into an hour-glass. He has done
well in the past.- He is doing better now â¢
than at any former period of his interest
ing career, and under the "expanded op
portunities now, open to him will do his
best work hereafter. We may ; indulge
sentiments of gratitude for" theY past, joy
for. the present and hopeful prophecy for
the future. We offer to him the helpful
ness of encouragement and the happiness
of appreciation. ..-.: r y r
. "And now, gentlemen,; lt ls*myÂ« pleasant
duty, on behalf of this company, to pro
pose the health and success of our distin
guished fellow-citizen,' Luther Burbank;
and may we drink this toast standing?"
Governor Pardee, who followed Mr.
Burbank, spoke on the development of
the resources of California,*ln wh!;n he
praised .the great work- of. Burbank.
The Governor o was loudly .applauded at
the close of hl^'remarks. - - \u25a0Â» ' >:.
.SENATOR" PERKINS* VIEWS.
Senator GÂ«orge C. Perkins said In part:
"Emerson has- said, 'If a man can write
a better book, preach a better sermon .or
make-a better mousetrap than his neigh
bor, though he -build hia house In the
woods, the world will make a beaten path
to his door.* ' , r - .'
"The force- of this maxim has been
truthfully illustrated In the life of our dts- 'â¢
tinguished guest, for scholars and scieÂ£-'
tists,- n6t-only from our own country, but
from many foreign lands, have made the
pilgrimage : from afar to the mecca of
Santa ; Rosa . to Bee the cactus and rose
bloom without brier* or thorn and to taste
delicious, fruits w^iose v flavor has been in
tensified by his wooing. ;\u25a0
"Only once do I remember bur guest
being misrepresented. "lt was in Phlla
delphiar when I called at a- nursery, to
procure some cuttings of the 'Burbank
rose. I asked the salesman who this
man Burbank was. He replied that Bur
bank was a Frenchman living 'in : the
south of France. I took pleasure In tell
ing that nurseryman that Mr. â¢ Burbank
was by-- compulsion a Yankee, born' in
Massachusetts, but by choice he became
a Callfornlan, and his name was the pride
of our. State.
"The work of our distinguished guest
in his field of agricultural development
is an . incentive to our Government^, to
profit by his*' experience and discoveries
In the evolution off plant life. He is do
ing more to instruct. Interest and make
popular the work in the garden than any
other' man of his generation. California is
proud of his achievements and delights to
class him as ono of ber most honored citi
zens. -. t- â¢
"The State Board of Trade esteems 'it a
greatj privilege to extend to him this com
plimentary banquet, although, knowing"
his modeety and retiring . disposition," we
realize that ;'. tie < would rather have , re
mained at his home In the City of Roses,
which haa become so dear to him by as
sociation with its treesand flowers, for
â¢He wanders away and away
With Nature, the dear old nurse,
Who sings to hinvnight and day..."
The rhymes of the universe.'"". -
John McNaught' was 'very : happy in his'
remarks on "The Pioneer of Science.'.' He
called the guest of " honor a pioneer of
science, and said that men like Luther
Burbank exercised power, for: the pros
perity of the world: and for the: increase
of human virtue. ; "Burbank was the! kind
of man," said the speaker, "that stands .
for a higher and a better : type : of man-*
kind. The world Is vastly better ' for his
having been in it." Mr. McNaught's
speech was received witn applause, while
the salient points *of wit and humor, with
which -it was Interspersed called - forth
bursts of laughter and cheers. "â¢ ?

demands cf justice must be fulfilled;
|hey only remembered that one of the
four criminals, the weakest, simplest of
them all. had been abandoned to fight
alone, and thty were filled with pity for
Â» him and with condemnation for E. J.
ilnrcions. thÂ« defendant at the bar, and
his associates, yet to be tried. Emtnons
* Lowed his h*>ac. while the verbal lasa

The sucdenr.ess with which the District
Attorney abandoned the direct examina
tion of Bunkers this morning created sur
prise. - He had asked "but a question or
two, Â£n<2 then the witness was turned
over to Grove L. Johnson, attorney for
the defense. Johnson immediately went
arter the confession- made by Bunkers,
now in the hands of District Attorney
Seyrr.our. Contrary to expectations, Sey
mour fought desperately to keep the con
feasicn secret, and tor the time at least
was suctressfuL
"There are things in that confessino fa
vcrable to our client," said Johnson, "and
we demand it."
The action of the District Attorney in
fighting this demand seemed to confirm
this view of the defendant. But the end
is not yet. Jchnscr. says he will continue
to demand the confession until he gets it,
s.nd interesting reading it will make.
A **pon the reconvening cf court this
morning. Bunkers was again called to
Â§the srand. * - â¢Â»U
District Attorney Seymour asked him
how it was that the sum to be paid by
the Phoenix Building and Loan Associa
tion's agents had been reduced from $500
to 5350.
* "Jordan told jus." answered Bunkers.
-that one of the companies that wanted
protection had withdrawn from the com
bination and refused to pay, as a result
of which withdrawal the four Senators
were to receive only $3&> each."
i District Attorney Seymour went again
i into the testimony bearing upon Emmons*
remark when informed by Bunkers that
Jordan had lined up some of the com
panies and would come to Sacramento
with seme boodle money.
Emmons said at that time, according to
Bunkers: "Let him bring it along. That's
s-.ee; that's what we're looking for."
â¢Take the witness." said Seymour, ad
dressing Johnson. *
"You're the Harry Bunkers that was
ca trial here last April for bribery, are
you cot?" asked Johnson. Â»
"Yes," answered Bunkers.
"At which time did you commit per
jury, then or now?" demanded Johnson.
"I am telling the truth this time; I
committed perjury the other " time," said
Bunkers Quietly. /
"I sha.ll ask then." said Johnson, "that
the District Attorney file an accusation
cf perjury against this witness and I. as
. Â»Â» citizen interested in justice, will swear
The District Attorney remained silent.
â¢â¢This is. not proper at this time," said
Judge Hart. "Proceed with the examina
tion."
"You made a statement to the District
Attorney, did you net?" asked Johnson.*
"Yes," answered Bunkers.
"Who was present?"
"The District Attorn* y and a stenog
rapher; my lawyers, Mr. Morehouse and
Mr. Alexander, were not present."
"Did you communicate with your at
torneys " ;
An ob jection to this question was sus
tained.
"Have you your statement?"
"Xo." â¢
"Do you know where it iÂ«T*
~Xo. but I presume the District Attor
ney has it.** -
"Did you sign it?" t
"No. I am positive on this point.** :
"\u25a0When did you last see it?" I
"A few days ago in the District Attor- j
Key's office." j
"Did you swear to this statement?** j
"So, sir."
"We now ask that the District Attor
ney," said Jofanscn. "present that statÂ«
â¢ment.'* -
"We object." said Jones. "Any state- '
ment made to the District Attorney is
sacred with him." Then fame the fight,
for half an hour counsel argued the ques
tion of the right of counsel for. the de
fense to a copy, ot Bunkers' confession. ,
Authorities were quoted at length by both
sides. At the conclusion of the debate.
Judge Hart said that be would consider
the so-called confession to be the private *
Memoranda of the District Attorney and j
Â»."sioranda. which the cpyt had no juris- |
diction to order prodoceo.- The demand ]
for the paper was therefore denied. The
defense noted an exception to the ruling.
"In the statement you made to the. Dis
trict Attorney Cld Ton tell the truth?"
sa!4 Johr.scz? j
-I'Cii-V- I
j M ls your memory better now than it was
â¢ last April."
"Yes. it is better, in truth, but the
j longer I stay in jail the worse it gets,"
) said Bunkers, petulantly.
, "When I made mr^ statement to .the ;
| District Attorney I told the truth. He !
| told me that he would not use the state- J
i ment against me should I get a new trial ;
I and that he would not 'prosecute me for \u25a0
| perjury. I would have made a state- j
j ment anyway for the simple reason that
' I was deserted by friends that claimed to
Ibe friends ; men that promised to help
[ me when I was In trouble: promised to
j help my wife and child; promised to go
j to work and ;ake care of them in San
i Francisco when they would be there.
i They were tn San Francisco, Senator Em
t mons 'end his wire. They didn't go near
j my wife; didn't help her; they knew the
! financial situation I was in; never went
near them. Here not very long ago he i
was in San Francisco t for three weeks;
never went near my wife, and my poor
wife was working her heart's blood out
to make a living for herself and my boy.
i That is why I did It."
i "You did it," said Johnson, "out of a
mean desire to get even."
"I guess that's right," answered Bunk
i ers. "
] "Didn't you- tell Attorney F. C. Jacobs
j tbat the District Attorney had agreed to
| confess perjury In your case in con- j
I sideration of your confession?" continued
"If these men had furnished a bond j
for you. you wouldn't have testified j
against them, would you?" . ; |
"I would not. They all deserted me.;
I feel just the same against French!
and Wright as I do against Emmons.
i Seymour spoke to me a month before I
confessed, but I did not tell until after
I knew that all of these men were in
I San Francisco and did not call upon my
j wife, nor aid her as they had promised
to do."
"Who was it that told you that Em
mons was in San Francisco ari3 did not
call upon your wife?"
"It was Senator â¢ Morehouse."
"I told you," said Johnson, tuening' to I
associate counsel, "Morehouse helped
work on \u25a0 his mind."
"It was Morehouse's statement that
! made you angry then?**
, "Yes. it was."
â¢ "What 'fairies* told you all of this
; that you are telling?"
"I object,". said Seymour. "There is
â¢ no evidence that any 'fairies' are in
| v*slved in this case." The objection was
sustained.
Then Johnson created a laugh by
reading from Bunkers' testimony given |
In April In, which he told" of his dis
appointment when his chauffeur told
him he was too busy to \u25a0 take out some
"fairies." " \u25a0 \u25a0 . '
"Now," again demanded "Johnson,'
"did you get this story frÂ£n those 'falr
liesr "
"I object," said Seymour. The ob
jection was overruled and Bunkers de
j nied that he had been coached by the
{"fairies." At this juncture adjourn
ment until 1:30 was ordered.
i- "I have been married seven years, and
think a great deal of my wife and fam
ily.", said Bunkers at the opening of the
afternoon session..

to look right If the other â¢ members of the
committee asked for thÂ«m.
"Why didn't you say that yesterday?"
asked Johnson.
"He did," said the District Attorney.
"He didn't,", roared Johnson, "and I as
sign your remark aa error."
The examination then proceeded by or
der of Judge Hart. Continuing Bunkers
said: . t -
Emmons then said an inqnialtor should be
appointed, ami on motion of Weight Emmons
was appointed. Then we decided to hold ex
ecutive sessions, as we did not want newspa
per reporters around. We then" appointed Mr 4
Vaughn as stenographer, as Emmons said he
could get Vaughn to change report to suit
things.
Yesterday Bunkers testified that French
was appointed inquisitor, and he became
confused when his contradiction was
pointed out. J However, he said G that he
was mistaken about ; Frenchâ that Em
mons was appointed inquisitor.
Johnson sought to find, more discrepan
cies in the testimony given- by Bunkers
yesterday afternoon and to-day, but made
little progress in this : direction. Bunkers
made some slight ; additions to-day, say
ing, his memory had been refreshed over
night and to-day he recalled some .minor
incidents which escaped him yesterday.
Johnson here read ' from \ the j testimony
given by Bunkers at his trial, in which
he testified that on the night the Commit
tee on Retrenchment -organized ; nothing
was done beyond perfecting organization.
Johnson asked Bunkers If he told the
truth then, and the witness responded
negatively.
"Then you knew ' when you gave that
testimony that you were committing per
jury?" Johnson asked.
Seymour and -.Jones objected to this
question, declaring 43^. was an , Insult to
the witness. 'An argument; followed, , the
court ruling with "Johnson. Bunkers said
he knew he was committing perjury, when
he testified' In his. own benalf." :'.7\ . - :
Johnson then took Bunkers back to
what he called f.the .."bargain",, with . the
District Attorney. JlThe witness stated no
Inducement' was ; : made â¢ other - than the
promise of immunity from prosecution for
perjury and the further,: promise that the
testimony he would' give In- the^ Emmons

\u25a0 :NEW YORK, Scut. H.â Following the
i arrest of Norman Hapgrood. editor of Col

libel ; made by Judge Deuel of thÂ© Court
i of Special Sessions and partner in T Town
; Topics, Robert" J.'CoUier, one of the own
! ers'of the publication of that name, to
i day issued a defiance to Colonel William
iD. Mann, the editor of Town Topics, and
! the controversy sives promise of lively
i developments/ Judge Deuel*s complaint
i rests upon an - editorial : of Collier's con
cerning "America's Smart- Set* and
."Fads and Fancies," enterprises conduct
ed by Town Topics, and Colonel Mann has !
already* brought two civil suits against >
the Colliers.
\u25a0:- In Judge Deuel*s complaint, upon which
[ Hapgood was arrested, it is said that P. !
I F. Collier and Robert J.. Collier were out
of town and could not be found, which
was "construed to 'mean that, criminal ac- ',
tion against them also was contemplated.
This action was followed by the appear
ance in to-day's issue of Town Topics of
: a paragraph supposed to have been writ- I
: ten by Colonel Mann, as follows: |
j As I . never deal*, my own -pen by writln* .

: When Robert J. Collier saw the para

sent a List of Salaries
Paid by the Company
NEW YORK. Sept. 14.-^1)611 the spe
cial legislative committee probing life in
surance companies' methods adjourned
to-day Chief Counsel Hughes had finished,
Jfpr the prestnt, the examination Into the
Mutual Life Insurance Company and the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company was
started upon.; -
Silas B. Dutcher, a director and a mem
ber of the finance committee, was called
to the stand. He was questioned regard-
Ing the securities held by the Metropoli
tan and as to the syndicate operations of
â¢iis company. He was asked the salaries
01 the company's officers, but could not
remember them. He wnl present the list
of officers', salaries to the committee' to
morrow, was still on the stand
when the committee adjourned. '
Earlier in the' day Treasurer Cromwell
had taken the stand to continue his ex
p.anation of the Mutual Life's syndicate
operations. In explaining the relations of
the Mutual with trust, companies, Crom
well eiated the interesting fact that on
th* purchase of $1,720,000 worth of shares
01 the Guarantee Title and Trust Com
pany, the Mutual had received in divl
oends 51.220,000, making these shares cost
nothing and realizing a profit. Mr. Crom
well 6aid these shares were now see
ing at ovÂ«r 600.
Of the advantage of dealing through
syndicates in preference to buying rail
road bonds direct. Cromwell said he had
actually trieu to buy bonds directly from
a railroad company. He went to his
*nend, Stuyvesant Fish, president of the
Illinois Central, and Fish told him that
he could not afford to sell the bonus to
the Mutual.
BANK OP CALIFORNIA SHARES.
In his testimony after the recess, ex
plaining a purchase of Bank of California
stock, Cromwell said the issue price of
the new stock was 350. Cromwell hoped
to get the shares at this figure, but in the
end the shareholders, to whom, under the
California law, the rights to the new issue :
belonged, held out and the Mutual ob
tained Its 5000 shares at an average price
of 380S-10. The sale was entirely by in
dividuals and there was no syndicate. The
transaction was left enltrely to William
Babcoek, with absolute confidence that he
was dealing fairly with the Mutual.
Hughes asked how the Increases or de
creases of bank balances were controlled.
"I control them," said Cromwell.
But finally he added that the finance
committee must approve all his actions,
for all the bank balances were scrutin
ized by the committee every week. His
own power of regulation therefore was
temporary and anything he might do
could be revoked within a week.
Cromwell was asked whether he In
creased or decreased his holdings in the
debentures of the United States Mort
gage and Trust Company to assist the
trust company. He replied:
Not entirely bo; it is partly to help onr
wholÂ« western clientele to know that through
one of our companies they can get money on
bond and fllortsage. '
How are advance* made. to amenta by the
Mutual*
It is done through the genera! agents of
the department-, but I understand the amounts
arc not large.
You have an account with the ' American
Exchange Bank?
We have had it for nearly a generation.
\u25a0 .You do not recel\-e any interest?
None whatever; ltÂ« president is one of our
trustees and he tells us frankly if . we want
Interest we must go eleewhere. but we have
not -.thought it gracious to close our account.
PRESIDENT'S POWER IS GREAT.
It was at this point that Dutcher was
called.
The I'st of stock and securities held
fey the Metropolitan on January 1, 1905,
was marked for identification; also the
lists of purchases and sales of securi
ties and syndicate participations in the
last ten years were produced and put
in evidence.
Of $75,000,000 of the securities held
by me Metropolitan, about $65,000,000
\u25a0were purchased from Vermllye & Co.
and W. A. Reid & Co. .
Dutcher said the president usually
did the purchasing of securities for the
iuetropolitan. It appeared from . the
questioning that the president of the
Metropolitan had sole discretion as to
in-. which banks tbnd trust companies de
posits should be kept.

Leland Wants
to Investigate
Tragedy.
Poison Said to
Have \Â¥orked
Rapidly.
A ecar.dal of no small - proportions .
threatens to fellow the suicide.of/Archi
bsJd Ralston Jr., who ended his .life ' in I
s. traffic manner in the Delmonico res-.
taurant on Wednesday nightl , According
to. a statement made yesterday by. Dr.
BacifralupL, the autopsy surgeon.at â¢ the
Morgue, Ralstcn was dead before the doc- '
tors arrived. Coroner Leiand comes out |
with the strong statement that. Dr.- J. I.
Stephen, head of the Emergency . Hospi
tal service, is either crooked . or t a . fool.
Dr. Bacigalupi bases. his statement on
the fact that the death of â¢ Ralston un
doubtedly resulted from cyanide of po
tassium poisoning. He * adds . that the
deadly poison always, causes death, within
five minutes. If such Is the fact,'.Ral
stcn was urely dead when Drs. Stephen
and Bauer arrived and it was certainly
their duty to notify the Coroner immedi
ately, which they neglected to do.
Stephen j tries to cover up his peculiar
actions by saying he thougnt Ralston
was evidently a man of refinement and
therefore he did not wish to have his
name brought into too much publicity
by taking the body to tne Morgue im-.
mediately. He says Ralstcn was .. alive
when he left the restaurant and that he
died at Sixth and Market streets.
Stephen says he and Dr. Bauer hurried
immediately to Truman's undertaking
parlors and deposited the" remains there,
so as to avoid notoriety. He told the
attendants there he did not ' want " the
papers to get the facts too quickly and
that the Coroner would be notified in
morning, so that everything would
â¢ tome out all right. . .
DR. JACKSON HESITATED.
But Dr. Jackson, the physician" ;' In
charge of the parlors at the time, -did not
take exactly the same view of the sub
ject. He says be told Stephen the , Cor
oner should be notified at once, a? it was
a case that came under his jurisdiction.
But Stephen insisted, so declares Jack
son, and the latter finally thought every
thing would be all right .as Stephen
was the head of the Emergency Hospital
service. ./
Coroner Leland is much wrought, up
over the affair. After making an investi
gation he said that Stephen was "either
crooked or a fooL" Iceland says he will
not dq anything In the matter till after
tht- inquest. Then a thorough investi
gation will be made and Dr. Stephen. will
be compelled to explain the . whple , mat
ter to ttie satisfaction of the- CoronÂ«r. \u25a0';
- -HatUe J. Thiebmilt, the- woman .; who
was with Ralston when he ended his Ufe."
made a full statement to Actinc'/Cap
tain Reynolds yesterday mat rung, in
which she corroborated everything she
â¢admitted In the interview published with
her in yesterday morning's Call. She told
how Ralstcn. showered, his affections on
her and attempted to make hÂ«r drink
poison both at the Sea Beach HcÂ»el In
Santa Cruz and in the Delmonico. res
taurant on Wednesday night: when he
ended his life^
Malcolm B. Scarth. the man who was
in thp restaurant apd rushed to Ral
tton's side as he was dying, is very much
broken up over the whole affair. It was
Ecarth who befriended Ralston when Ke
t v.&Â£ suffering from delirium treznens and
who went with him" to | Santa" Cruz and
thf-re took care of him. till assistance ar
rived. Scarth even went so far as to pawn
his jewelry to aid Ralston in his hour of
reed. He ' was a true friend.
STEPHEX OPENS LETTER.
"When I was waiting for. develop
ments in .the restaurant after Ralston
took the poison," said Scarth, ."one ' of
the attendants there handed me. a. let
ter that was written by Ralston be
fore he died.* -The missive had been
opened . and I found out it .was Dr.
Stephen who opened it. I . Informed
Coroner Leland of this. and .he told me
Stephen had no right to open, the let
ter, as it was my private property."
The restaurant people say they rang
in . for an Emergency Hospital ambu
lance when they learned that Ralston
liad taken poison, but this statement is
absolutely false, for no call was re-

Chief of Police John Conrad has satis
fied himself that the Cook girl was gross
ly abused and is energetically endeavor
ing to bring the guilty person or persons
to answer for the crime. One young man
suspected of having been implicated in the
scandal has left the city, but the police
believe they can apprehend him if neces

FORESTERS AT WAR.
OAKLAND, Sept. H. â As a result of
long standing trouble in Court United
States No. 3S, the Grand Court of the
Foresters of America has brought suit
in Judge Qulnn's court against the
members of Court United States, which
has recently been suspended from the
order, for the recovery of paraphernalia
valued at $700 and $160 claimed by the
Grand Court. It is alleged that the
money, which was a part of the funds
of the suspended lodge and which the
grand officers declare should have re
verted to the Grand Court when the
subordinate court was suspended, was
withdrawn from the Farmers 1 and Mer
chants' Bank by a self-constituted com
mittee of the defunct court and has
been held by- them In violation of the
by-laws of .the order.
I. O. Kassat, ,. deputy grand chief
ranger of the -order, is conducting the
case of the Grand Court, and Leopold
Jacobs,; M. .HeFiman and R. Lewlnare
named as the members of the commit
tee which, it Is charged, unlawfully
withdrew funds of the suspended lodge
from the bank.
WILL'S HOUSE BOTHERSO3IE.
OAKLAND, Sept 14. â Because his
new house encroaches eight inches on
an adjoining lot, Carl A. Will, resid
ing at 366 Tenth Btreet, finds himself
eadly mixed in the meshes Â«of the new
. building" ordinance. He first tried to
buy the eight inches of property, but
Its owner refused to sell. Then he
wished to raise his house and build a
store under; it. but the Board of Public
Works could not grant permission for
the erection of a frame building inside
the fire limits, and now, when Will
wishes to move his house, he finds that
he must secure thepermisslon of every
property-owner in 'the block in which
he lives before he can move the struc
â¢ ture off. the land of his -neighbor. "..

MAKES A DEAL
IN LAKE LAND
Mayor (^airis ;Yaluable Con
" cession From Owners of
\'Twelfth'*- Street 'Frontage
OAKLAND,' Sept. 14.â Maj-or Frank X. !
Mott, by authority of a committee. [of fthe
City Council, has successfully negotiated
a deal- by which the city can acquire,
title to six acres lying within the boule- j
yard lines of Lake Merritt, | the private
ownership of' which has, for many years,
blocked the improvement ; of the lake.
Through .the Mayor's efforts the heirs
of the Adams estate have agreed to sell
this valuable . holding .to the city for
$15,000, which, it is, estimated,' is one-half
of itrf value, unreclaimed, v and, less than
twenty-five per ' .cent reclaimed. - The
land hag a frontage -on' Twelfth g street
dam of 600 feet j along the north side and ;
includes a tract in' the southwestern cor
ner of the lake, east of .Fallon street, that !
ia a controlling piece 'on account of its I
frontage on the dam. \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0
. At a recent meeting cf the citizens' ad
visory committee and the City Council
decision was reached to make the effort
to purchase : this plat for the city.. It is
owned by; Edson F. Adams, John Chariest
Adama and ' their sister,- Mrs., Thomas
Prather. The Mayor undertook the nego
tiations with some hesitation; because- he
knew the city was .not in a position
financially to^pay the full value of the
property. -The title held by- the Adams
heirs' is 'perfect, coming -down ;\u25a0 from the
Poralta grant' patent. Concerning the
transaction .as it stands, ; \ Mayor Mott
. said:' \u25a0\u25a0.-;;..; \u25a0--;;,-.;; ; \u0084 . , ' .;...\u25a0 : :â¢- \u25a0.-;.. '
The Adamaes hayÂ« agreed to sell their lands
at the lake front for. $15,000,, a. figure 'l be
lieve to be, more than, reasonable in view ot
the location of , the property, which commands
bo | much frontage on the dam. ' Two of the
boathofises on the dam \u25a0 are within the \u25a0, Adams',
lines. They. have. J with Ino MtUe display of
public â¢ spirit, given -the city an opportunity to
get ownership of this frontage at a figure that
appears -to\u25a0\u25a0 me as very fair. \u25a0â¢; I feel, that the
negotiations indicate a" commendable . spirit on'
the part of .the, owners.. To acquire this 'plat 1
means that the city can beautify the Twelfth
street frontage a? It dwmsbest, and that the
entire scheme of lake and adjacent park im
provement can go forward without hindrance.
The â¢ Mayor 'will \u25a0;; recommend 'that the
City ' Council make an appropriation of
$15,000 to carry out the purchase of the
lands." The 'Adams heirs have thereto-;
fore shown "much- interest In the - lake
project by giving the city apark site and
conservatory at the - northwestern arm
ofrthe lake. ' ; ? " / '. > :
. -The City. Council to-night in executive
session'agreed; to ' make** the* appropria
tion" to - purchasei*th'e ';:- Adams* property
and Ito pass ; the ./ordinance to ' dredge
Lake Merritt r .The latter ! bill, carrying'
an appropriation of 550,000. was recom
mended to-hlghtby.the'Park and Boule-'j
yard Committee of the ' Council.' It was
provided that any. surplus Lin the" allow
ance for .dredging; shall : ; be used -for,
park improvement "at the 'lake.*

ment of his majority In "a manner that
redounds greatly to his credit. Ha .was
present at > the laying of the cor.nerstona
of the magnificent new Armitaga Orphan
age, which' is. the splendid gift that hÂ»

memory of their parents.
The ceremonies were deeply Impressive.
The Right Rev. William Ford Nichols,
D. D., Bishop of California, presided, and
was assisted by many of the Episcopal
clergy of the diocese. Scores of visitor*
journeyed to the site of the orphanage to
take part in the services.
In laying the cornerstone and in dedi
cating the great buildings to the purpose
for which they will soon be^.* erected
Bishop Nichols paid a well-deserved
tribute to the motive which prompted tha
young people to their splendid generosity.
Not only will the memory of worthy
parents be preserved, but thousands of
helpless children will be guarded and nur
tured until they are ready and prepared
to take up the burdens of a life In wncih
from the earliest childhood they are terri
bly handicapped.
The new Armltage .Orphanage will be
perhaps the handsomest and most thor- ,
oughly equipped orphan ' asylum in tha .
United States. The buildings will be lo
cated in the foothills ' a short distance
from the present structures. The site U
one of the most commanding In San Ma-.
teo County and is Ideally adapted for Its
purpose. Grading is now in progress and
building will commence without delay.

Accident Occurs in
Business House
of Father.
WalUice Bradford Jr., the IS-year-old I
j son of "Wallace Bradford, vicer president |
;or the Hulsc-Bracford Company, T72-Â«
j Miscicn street, was caught in the
j elevator in. the campani-'s store about
: 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon and his life
j crushed out. How the accident happened
may never be known, as the young man
i was alone at the time and the clerks first
j realized his dansrer when they saw the
1 plaster failing from the walL I
Ycung Bradford had just gone from, the ]
second floor to the first, and as the door I
an that floor was open, it is supposed he
': was just leaving the elevator when it was
I started up in some mysterious manner
! and caurnt its yoang victim somewhere t
I between rhÂ« nrst and second floors. Neil ]
i Parker, a cierk on the second floor, heard
; his cries and ' rushed to the shaft, but
'; was unable to render any assistance.
; Artnur Lawrence, a clerk on the first
; floor, saw the plaster falling from the
wall, and, realizing that some one was
caug-ht in the elevator, ran into the base
ment, where, with the assistance of Fred
! Eecker. he broke ct>en the door of the
: power room and shut down the power.
; The elevator was by this time about half
\u25a0 way between the two floors and it was
necessary to call in several carpenters
; and the uick and shovel men who were
working on the street railway hi front of
\ the stcre to cut a hole through the wall.
! ThÂ«s young man was found with his head
I !a the car and his feet Â«?aT!gti-ng- below.
I from which it would seem he had
j tried to ff2t through the open door feet
i first after the elevatar had started up.
I A physician was immediately called, but
! all signs of life were gone before he ar
\ rived. After taking the testimony of
i the clerks, the Coroner turned the body
I aver to the family.
Young Bradford had just finished school
j and thr<?e weeks ago took hia place
i among the clerks cf his father's store
;to ieam the ways of the business. He
I was bright and conscientious, and polite
i to every one and had all the qualities for
! the making cf a good business man.
Bradford showed his courage when he
and two other boys, caught and held
Cnariea Henry, the footpad, who held up
Joseph Frankenbers on the corner of
Clay and Spruce streets on December 23
j last.

THE CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR.
THE selection of Mr. Partridge as the standard bearer of the
forces of purification and reform was made after due and ample
deliberation and consideration. When The Call begaiv this
campaign for the disinfection of the city government we cited, the
example of Oakland, where the Municipal League has become a hx
ture, as a genuine clearing-house for the examination andindorse
racnt of candidates. That organization undertakes the task of ex
amining into the record and the availability of candidates who offer
themselves, or are offered by their friends, for office. Availability,
is always considered. It may be that the situation one year makes
unavailable a blameless and* useful man, who, is readily accepted
another year, a situation having arisen into which he fits. It seemed
to us highly necessary that this function should be discharged by
some authority in San* Francisco, as part of the movement necessary
to lift this city from the low state to which -its government has de
clined. Finally the Republican League appeared, equipped for the
duty of selection and with the courage of rejection of candidates.
The result is that the coming ticket will bear the impress of keen
inspection, and will stand examination.
U is worth remembering that as a result of the work of the
Municipal Lea cue in Oakland there has come about a substantial
union of the people upon the platform of municipal and not national
IÂ«o?itics. In the last two campaigns the Republican candidate for
Mayor has been made the nominee of all parties, and the other
places on the ticket necessary to municipal integrity have been in
dorsed in the same way. regardless of their national political affilia
tion?. The result has been a government in that city which makes
for decency and enjoys the confidence and respect of the people.
This is as it should be, and San Francisco, proposes to follow
thi* near and inspiring example. To 'that end the caucus of the
dfelegates to the Republican convention has indorsed men for office
whom every citizen should be happy to support. Most of them have
been tried." They are no experiment. Auditor Baehr narrowly
escaped being the' nominee for Mayor/but will bide his time in the
important office of Auditor, which he has filled with conspicuous
ability and honor. The same may be said of John McDougald for
Treasurer. City Attorney Long and County Clerk Greif, all of whom
have received the indorsement deserved by the faithful and fault
less discharge of their duty.
It is confidently expected that the Democratic convention, with
equal painstaking patriotism, will meet its share of the emergency
by indorsing for common support the unusually excellent members
of the Board of Supervisors for which that party is responsible.
There is only one banner to march under this year. It is the stand
ard of anti-graft, anti-dirt, anti-vice, and the body of candidates
who will bear it will be found equal to the emergency which, for
the first time in their political lives, brings them shoulder to shoul
der to keep step in a common cause.
To lead them a fit man is chosen. Mr. Partridge is a native Cali
fornian, reared in the country, getting his mental and physical and
moral energy in contact with the soil and the plain people who look
to it for their bread. Taking the responsibility of manhood upon a
boy's shoulders he was dutiful to the members of .his. family de
pendent upon- him, and while discharging it, by his own toil worked
his wav through school, through the university, through his law
course "and through a post-graduate college course. As a boy he
.edited a newspar-r, taught mathematics and languages in the
schools and, entering upon his profession, has practiced it honorably
and gainfully. .
The accidents of life put upon him what the world calls bur
dens: Fortune was not ready made to be his by inheritance, but
was won by his own head and hai)d. His is a creditable American
career. It 'is the kind that makes strong men and good mqi. Out
of the variety of his experiences such a man is kept in touch with
the sorrows and joys, the failures and successes of his brother man.
â¢He is not a partial development of humanity, but is \vhole*sided,
and made wise by what he has himself lived out. Great cities get
the best men from the countrj-, whence he came in cmest of self
. support. Born and reared in the rugged mountains, he has their
strength, and the city may well look, in this time of stress and
strain, to the hills whence cometh her help.
Under the lead of this energetic citizen the ticket will go for
ward .to victory. His enemies are already crying that he is young.
He is older than Jefferson when he wrote the Declaration; older
than Washington when he gave Braddock advice that would have
saved the massacre of Fort Duquesne; older than Pitt when he be
came Prime Mimster, and nearly the age of Roosevelt when elected
to the Vice Presidency.
His enemies say he lacks experience. Let us tell them that
bis experience in boyhood and manhood, his devotion to filial duty
and the courage of its discharge, his support of himself and others
while getting an education, is the best experience that a man can
have. There is none other that equally ripens and prepares a man
for hard and high responsibility. It. may be noticed that these crit
icisms are made by men who present Mayor Schmitz as the. fittest
man in the city for Mayor. Let them give us the kind of experi
ence that made' him fit for the office, or deserving of the florid praise
THE SPRINGS DECLINE.
IT is reported that many springs in the western foothills of the
Sierras that have been immemorially affluent at all seasons and
have been a reliable dependence for potable water and for irriga
tion have ceased to flow since this midsummer. The creeks fed by
them are dry in their beds and there is keen apprehension as to
future supply. While new here, these unpleasant things' are old
elsewhere. They are caused by stripping the mountains of- their
copse and forest by fire and ax.
For a quarter of a century the press of this State has sounded
the warning in vain. What it foretold is now coming to pass., vThe
tree is the mother of the fountain, and the mother has been slain,
so the fountain ceases to flow. We must now face the reforestation
of denuded tracts as the price. of water in the future. Restore the
foliage and the springs will flow again. One of the charms of hun
dreds of miles of our foothills has been the fine water of the springs.
It is going. Next the steady flow of the large streams will be im
paired, decline and cease. The bosky dells and green banks that have
made bur mountains beautiful will disappear and the irrigator, in the
valley will open his headgates in vain at the season:when his thirsty
crops and withering orchards need water.
An enlightened public opinion was needed to prevent the cause
of these appalling effects. The press and many volunteer organiza
tions sought to produce such opinion, but sought in vain. A dollar
in the hand seemed more than a spring in the bush. The dollar, mul
tiplied into millions, has been taken from the forests. The careless
hunter or herder, by the recklessness of a moment, has followed the
lumberman by fire, and now the distressing and prolonged r .results
of both greed and wantonness are upon the foothills and will go tip
the mountains.
It is enough to make one despair, but there is a chance left' The
National Forestry Bureau is willing to replant and reforest the bare
slopes. May we not help? May we not turn public opinion to
reparation of the damage already done ? It is worth trying.

QUESTIONS AXD ANSWERS.
OUESTIOX-If Jane has seven chil
dren and Henrietta has one, which
has the more trouble in rearing her
"little flock"?
Answerâ lr depends somewhat on the
kids, but if you have to bet on either se- ;
lect Henrietta on general principles. The
hen. with one chicken almost always does
the most 'ciucking. .
Q.â lf John has a â¢ million dollars and
James has but one, which will be the
more desirous to get another?
A.â Speculate on James.
Q.âlt Abel goes to the races with a
"sure tip" and J25. what will he have in
his pocket when he returns home?
A.â What are the contents of a hole
that has nothing in it?
Q.â lf some women were as good aÂ« they
look what would they be?
A.â No, they wouldn't; the days when
angels were visible on this earth are past.,
Q.â When a man has tackled old John
Barley.corn and been permanently laid
out, what does he blame? . ,
A.â Any thing and everything except the
whisky, of course. \u25a0-\u0084.
Q.â lf one â¢ fool smokes more than is
good for his health, how many fools will
be'required to smoke still more? .
: A.â Just one; the same fool will do it in
all probability. - J

BRIEF CHAT WITH ADOI/PHIIS.
You may never have thought .of it,
! Adolphus, but if you really are bright, as
you sometimes have suspected, it is your
poor, old, plodding pa and your often per
plexed ma to whom you are indebted for
the dowry. You may pretty safely bet
I that you have .no characteristic which
j did not descend to you through your ap
cestry. The figs that thistles bear are
not very much of a success as yet, and I
do not believe they are going to be for
come time to come. If you are a fig, it is
a rather safe speculation that you grew
on a fig tree: if you merely are a thistle
that' thinks itself a fig, that is another
i matter.
And if there Is "good stuff" in youâ
which 1 do not deny, Adolphusâ don't, you
think it is about time that you began to
appreciate the ones who gave it to you,
Instead of halting them in the middle of
a sentence by taking exception to its
grammatical construction? Of course, if
you are only a thistle thornâ but you do
not admit that, Adolphus? No, I thought
not. Then why not devote a little time
to admiring and appreciating the fig tree
on which you grew? It is a gnarly and
misshapen fig tree, perhaps, but it is a
fig tree nevertheless, and you need be

Give Thanks
Angela Morgan
G" n'E "thanks! There is 'nothing j
: you can do that will so speedily â¢
set you. right with your best j
self and square \u25a0 with the universe as ;
the .attitude of thanksgiving.
V There is' nothing that will more
' surely put you in the current of good
; and awaken you to the knowledge of
your unsuspected, powers than lifting
up your heart Ing ratitude' and praise.
Give thanks! There is no better way
to get in ; touch with the mighty Joy
forces'and health forces that surround
you, awaiting, your right attitude.
If you want to be put close to the in
fluences that will help you conquer dif
ficulties, master work and prevail over
trouble, :11ft up your soul and "give
thanks.' .
It:> is "amazing how quickly a gTay
world will kindle Into color when one
practices praiae. "It is wonderful how
a barren .: existence;: will blossom into
beauty when one learns to give thanks.
You have not much to be thankful
for? How do -you know? You cannot
tell until you start the habit of thanks
giving. Just try It. Don't wait to
enumerate the things you are not
thankful for. Don't sum up slowly
and doubtfully ;wbat you may please to
term your meager blessings.
No. Just begin to give thanks. For
what?
First, give thanks because you are
alive. Ii; you form the habit of doing
this daily, .you will be amazed to see
how, rapidly you will find your reasons
for, loving, existence multiplying.
Then, give thanks for ; your work,
whatever it' is. Be glad of the discip
line it offers you and of the opportun
ity it gives you to develop your re
sources. Tell yourself dally that you
rejoice in it. that you glory in "it.
This is a splendid way to start the
habit of rejoicing. After you are well
in the current you will find so many
things to be glad of that you' won't
be able to count them. A realization
of the blessings and the advantages
that are yours will pour in upon you
overwhelmingly. -
Why?
Because when you take the attitude
of thankfulness you tune yourself .to
every created thing that is expressing
praise. 'You are in: harmony with the
hills and meadows rejoicing in the sun;
you are in touch with the spirit' of
mountains that lift their purple'sum
mits in an eternal attitude of praise.
' All creation does give thanks un
ceasingly. All nature rejoices. In the
mere fact of existence. Look out upon
the world and see. Go into the coun
try and witness the rejoicing of trees
and plants and all growing things. See
how every leaf and blade quivers in an
ecstasy of praise. Look at sun-steeped
corn fields, glistening and gleaming, a
riot of gold and brown and green. Lis
ten to the Joyful music of that hidden
orchestra In the grass. Everything
gives thanks. ..
And how about mankind? Why
should all nature be athrlll and alive
and agleam with thankfulness to the
creator and man be heavy, Indifferent,
doubting, -despondent, cynical?
Why should any human being .-re
main stolid and ungrateful, having
eyes:that see not., ears that hear not?
Why.; is; it. that man alone of all crea
tures, should fall to adequately express
thanks to the creator? .
Until man, self-conscious and. free. of
will, does learn to give thanks radiant
ly, fully, for the 'gift of life, he will fall
to get- the gold out of existence. ~ Will
fail to see the world in Its finest,.high
est aspect. Will if all to discover him
self.
Give thanks.- There Is no surer way
to find life' splendidly worth living.
Moses Home in Moon.
A Brooklyn man. Constantine Mc-
Keever, has evolved - a . new theory of
creation which he solemnly asserts, in
lectures he is. giving at Kensington, Is
the; only correct one. Briefly put, says
the Brooklyn correspondent of the Chi

Away.back in the dim past a hobo of
a comet; shaped/according to Mc-
Keever, like, a doughnut, with a hole
In the middle, butted Into the then ex
isting" wojrld." Now. comes the solu
tion. It, caused the famous deluge.
The earth shot up through the hole
in the doughnuL All j living things were
annihilated except those near water.
They were cooled off by the resulting
vapor, but some got burned and be
came negroes.
Not satisfied with pushing its "nose"
through the doughnut, the earth started
on ; a record-breaking dash for the sun.
Some earths -that went through the
process earlier have overtaken the fu
gitive, and are now flattening : them
selves out In vain endeavor to push
right through. Those are the sun
spots.C
When the earth got well past the
doughnut â¢-\u25a0 the people on It began to
scamper," flown to, the south pole. Mean

ASKS TO BE RESTORED
Her Petition to. Be Declared
Sane Opposed by Rela

. A big gathering of women listened to
come amusing testimony in Judge Ker

during the hearing of the suit of Mar
garet Allen to be restored to capacity.
According to Mrs. Ellen . Finniser. wife
of Mrs. Aliens present guardian, the
vonwi who would be declared mentally
competent danced in the surf at Lands
Kmt a few months ago, being clad at
the time in a red flannel petticoat only.
This weird tÂ«Â»rpslchorean stunt, Mrs.
Kinniger declares, was inspired by a glass
at claret and beer, mixed by Mrs. Frank
Hall and her brother. Gaston Gaschlin.
The occasion was a private picnic, at
T.-hfch many of the relatives of Margaret
AHen were present.
Mrs. Fin::i?er declares that Mrs.- Allen

ftrts that the property has grown In
value under his carÂ© and that the at
tempt to have her restored to capacity is
an effort on the part of her other rel
atives to get possession of the property.
Other eccentricities of Mrs. Allen were

clared that the applicant for restoration

DECLARE YOUTH
WAS TORTURED
Serious Charges Are Made
Against Boys' and Girls*
Aid Society by Relatives
SAY CHILD WAS BEATEN
Grandmother and Sister of
Ray. Riley Assert That He
Received Terrible Abuse
Charges of being extremely cruel io
Way Hilay, a 14-year-old boy, 'were
made against the managers of the Boys'
and Girls' Aid Society in Judge Gra
ham's t-ourt yesterday; The charges are
contained In affidavits filed by Abigail
â¢Â£*â¢ Keene, thÂ« boy's grandmother, and
Airs. Cora. Kiley ckre.igra. his sister.
Aceor-iir.g to the â¢ women, Ray was
piaced in charge of Superintendent Her
bert R, Lew-is early m July. When
Mrs. Cireaga vent to visit him a week
later she declares she was told he had
!>een sent to Vetalunia to rick fruit.
About throe days later he returned to
the home of tils sister, near Campbells.
The sister declares that when he camo
to the i'housf lie showed evidence of ter
rible beatingrs. She says that it was
three weeks belore he was able to get
out of bed. His back, shoulders and
arms and legs were black and blue, the
bister asserts. The grandmother "says:
"I fiw the boy at Campbells on July r>.
He complained of being sick and sore
by reason of severe -beatings received
from people who had charge of him
at the Boys' and Girls' Kid Society and
at t!i^ camp at Sobastopol. He could
not >valk or hold himself erect."
Judge Graham ordered that Superin
tendent IÂ«ewis have the boy produced
in the Juvenile Court at 2 o'clock this
afternoon. Policeman ' Scott, represent
ing the society, was sent to Santa Rosa
to get him.
Herbert B. I^wis. superintendent of
the Boys' find Girls' Aid Society, is at
present at Windsor, on the Russian
River, at the camp of the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society. George C. Turner,
Lewis' assistant, when Interviewed yes
terday stoutly denied that young Rlley
had ever been brutally beaten. He said:
Ray Rtley was committed to the Boys" and
Girls' ASd Society for one year by Judc Mu
rasky. The youth was accused by his father
;of having stolen $10 from him. For this -of-.
fense he was xnt to the Institution on June 2.
On June 3 tbe boy - was sent with other boys
to the annual camp at Barlow's, Sonoma, to
pick berries. The boys are not restrained very
much and It Is very eaÂ«y for the youngsters
to get away, a? there are but eight officers to
look alter them. Toung Rlley ran away on
June 8 and went to his sister's home at Camp
bells. Officer Scott went down there and
brought the boy back. He again ran away on
July 27. going to his Mster's home. The boy
was captured at the same place. On August
21 he escaped again and after he was captured
at Ms mother's place he* 1 was turned over to
Sheriff' Grace of Sonoma, and will be held in
hi* custody until the camp breaks.
1 am care that young Riley was encouraged
by tis sirter to run away. On one occasion
when Officer Scott called at the Riley home at
Campbells to bring the boy back to the camp
his mother held the officer while the youth
rlimbed over the back fence and succeeded in
retting away. The mother made a complaint
that the child had been brutally whipped and
I examined him to see if he was marked, and
he was not. It wu true that the child had
been punished for running away, but the pun
ishment is net in any way brutal. Young Rlley
:k a rather meek lad. and I am certain if he
was not encouraged by his sister, to run away
we would have no trouble with the lad.
When a boy is given ''capital" he is whipped
with a strap, but there is no danger of mark-
Ing or crippl'.ng the boy in any manner.
JUBn.EE SOUVENIR
IS A WOB-K OF ART
Sisters of St. Mary's Hospital
Publish History of.
Institution.
In connection with the golden jubilee
recently celebrated by St. Mary's Hospital
there has been issued a golden jubilee
souvenir that is a work of art. It is a
book of ninety pages, neatly bound in a
heavy white paper cover. Typographically
it in a gem, and as a literary effort it is
far beyond anything in the souvenir book
line ever before published here. A picture
of the founder of the order. Mother Cath
erine; McAuley, a gifted "irishwoman,
graces the first page. Scattered through
out the book are pictures of the hospital,
its medical staff, corps of nurses and of
prominent clergymen. |
The book tells in graphic style of the
trials of the eight nuns who, under the
leadership of Mother Mary Russell, sister
of the late Lord Russell, Chief Justice of
England, came to the Gold.en State in De
cember, 1554, and began their labors in
behalf of the afflicted. It tells of the
founding of St. .Mary's Hospital by these
devoted women and gives a complete his
tory of the institution up to the present
time. The book will be sold for $1, the
proceeds to be applied to the building
fund of the new hospital, to be erected
near the park by the Sisters of Mercy.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER" 1>: IUUS;
READY TO TAKE
TAINTED MONEY
Gladden Has Few,.- Support
ers Among;
Now in Session iiL Seattle
AWAITING RESOLUTION
Ministers Not aii Favor of
Plan; to Examine the Life
History of Alms Givers
SEATTLE, Sept.- : 14.'â A strong senti
ment has been expressed among the mem
bers of the American * board of commis
sioners for foreign f missions of the Con-~
gregational church, now in session in this
city, against the resolution that has been
drafted by Dr. Washington Gladden \u25a0 to
present to the convention in his . fight
against "tainted I money."
The resolution, has not been' presented j
to the convention, but the general sent!-' ,
nunt^ among the -members is that 'the :
resolution would be lost)- by an ;.. over
whelming majority. * In view of the senti
ment that has been- expressed by the
members it is impossible %to state what
action will be taken by Dr." Gladden. ,
Dr. Gladden has not -reached "the city
as yet, although the New England; party,
193 strong, arrived in > Seattle this morn
ing. The most prominent i among the
New Englanders who arrived - this morn
ing is G. Henry Whitcomb,- chairman of
the ( prudential committee, | to . which g the
question of "tainted money" was referred
some weeks ago. Mr. Whitcomb has ex
pressed himself as strongly \u25a0 opposed to
the adoption of any. resolution by, the
board dealing with the Question and the
committee of which he is chairman will
recommend that no action of any char
acter be taken. In outlining his positiou
on the question Mr. Whitcomb made the
following statement:
I do not know what Dr. Gladden proposes
to do. The incident is really closed, though oi
course the question can be brought up under
the head -of new business or can be inter
jected at almost any time. We are bound to
consider any matter that is proposed, no mat
ter how radical or how absurd it might be.
But every one. almost. . save Dr." . Gladden,
considers that matter settled. * A canvass of the
300 members of the board showed a short time
ago that 90 per cent of tbe members were op
posed to Dr. Gladdens position. If he \u25a0 brings
up the question It will be quickly disposed of.
The prudential committee cannot be placed
In the position of looking up a man's history
and his family* record whenever " he offers
money to carry on the work of the church.
Dr. Gladdens resolution would make It neces
. sary for the board : to weigh tbe standing of
every roan and to put the committee in the
position of censoring ~ every donation. : That
cannot be done, and I do not believe the board
will suggest It. â¢
Most of the time of the board during
the conference in this city, will be taken
up with the consideration of the question
of maintenance of foreign missions. Ac
cording to the statement of Mr. Whit
comb there was .a ' deficit at the end of
the last fiscal year of $150,000 and the
question of financing the 600j missions
which the board has in . the field Will
be the most important matter to consider.
Among the members who reached the
city from Boston' this morning "are a
number of missionaries who will sail from
this city on September 20 for Japan. These
missionaries have been invited to appear
before the board and tell of the work
that has been done in the past and the
plans for the future for Japan. \u25a0
The annual review of the work. of the
board in the different* countries in'which
missions have been established was pre
sented to the committee this morning.
The review dealt with Japan, Turkey, In
dia and Ceylon. China, Papal lands and
Africa.
At the opening of the session this morn
ing the visitors were greeted by the Rev.
8. M. Freeland.' for years identified with
the churches of the Pacific Coast, and
response was; made by Dr. .Samuel B.
Capen of Boston, the president of the
board. 4
The minutes of the- last meeting of the
Commissioners were read by Rev. Henry
A. Stimson. D. D.. of New York, the re
cording secretary, after, which President
I Capen appointed the customary commit
tees. Treasurer Frank H. Wiggin read
the report of the -Treasury- Department
and the report of the auditors ;of the
board was then submitted. It Is as . fol
lows: \u25a0?\u25a0 >:
Total receipts i for the year ending August
31 were $752,149.' Not Included in this amount, â¢
because given for a . specified purpose,, was the
gift of $55,000 from John D. Rockefeller in
part payment of a pledge of $100,000 for edn
cational work for institutions allled-wlth the
board. Treated In the same way waÃ a gift of
$5000 from Frank Vanderpool for a new build
ing in connection "with St. Paul's Institute :at
Tarsus. If these two sums were added, the
total amount from . the receipts would . be
J512.140. " "
The total disbursements, including the gift*
of Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. .Vanderpool, were
$905,930, and the excess of expenditures above
receipts was $153,790, which, added' to the
debt of the previous year, of $22,737, makes a
debt carried over to the . account . of the new
year of $176,527. ' .
The amount of conditional gifts received waa
$34,730, the conditional gift fund now amount
ing to i $491,713. , a, growth of , $29,430. \u25a0 The
twentieth century . fund now \u25a0 : amounts to
$136.175, and unpaid ; pledges ' are in hand
which will swell it to about $144,000.

The Seals ran second to tha Commuters
In the twelfth spasm at Recreation Park
yesterday afternoon simply because they
fell down when Busher Henley was pitch
ing ball good enough to win any game
ever played on any man's lot. Had the
San Francisco fielders played baseball as
it should have been played, Henley would
have been the victor by a score of 1 to 0.
but things did not come out right.
Up to the twelfth spasm, the Commuters
'had made but one little hit off \u25a0 Henley
and, he was pitching the grandest kind of
baseball all this time. / There should not
have been a run registered against him,
but Hildebrfend started the bad work In
the fifth when he dropped Dunleavy's fly
out in deep left field, letting old Van Hal
tren scoot over the pan from second
base.
The Seals could not come through with'
a run till the eighth. Then a couple of
bunte, a boot by Moskiman and a long
fly on which every one moved up helped
some and the score was tied ,up, remaining
so lill the twelfth when . the Commuters
broke up the game.
Mofikiman started it with a drive into
right field and Kelly laid down a bunt.
Richards laid down another bunt and
beat the throw to first base. Devereaux
came along -with a hot grounder which
| Charley Irwin booted, giving Moskiman |
ample time to slip through. with the run
that won the game for Oakland.
The Seals had a grand chance to bring
home the money in their half of the
twelfth, but they fell down badly. Shea
opened It with a two-cushion wallop out
to center field. _He was anxious to stretch
the hit into a * triple, but was cut down
dead as he tried to tear into third base.
Two more hits followed, but they did no
good," so the Seals finished that inning
with three hits and nothing; to show, for
them. The score:

Nelson Is Seeking
Settlement With
xVLanager. ?
j The ; unpleasant j disclosures which \u25a0 have
I resulted in the controversy between Har
| ry v Corbe{t and Billyh Nolan;- manager of
â¢ Battling) Nelson, begin "| to assume a j se-^
rious aspect. ; Both' men : charge" the other
with crooked dealing. ~ Nolan's Claim! that
Corbett is holding but $1000 on 5 him to. pay
his share In the corruption fund; which is
alleged to have "\ been | raised to^ beat I the
Ralston bill at the last Legislature cre
ated a decided stir yesterday. ; , ' -"â¢
"v; The rival ; managers and promoters real-;
lze' they, have j said too much ; in regard jto ,
shady looking transactions, and last night
they were ' reticent regarding | the situa
tion. They tried to : pass the- matter off
as lightly, as possible. , At : the same time
all are ..worried and disturbed, for Stales
of an investigation by, the Grand Jury are
flying j thick and^ fast along the; line. : â¢â¢'; ' -.\u25a0*
And- in- the i midst of \u25a0 the -entire ugly
looking " mixup Matt Larkin, the well^
known sporting man and friend of Harry
Corbett, comes out with a statement that
Billy Nolan * approached . him ; some itime
ago and 'trledto talk business with him
whereby a fake might be framed up and
Nelson lose to Britt on a foul.
Larkin says \ this episode happened last
May. after the White ; fight. He avers ;
Nolan came to^ him and said there was a j
good chance to put one over and to, leave
Nelson out of . the Job. According to ; Lar
kin,-Nolan "wanted the latter to -furnish
JlO,OOO to wager. Then it was planned by
Nolan to use the ammonia sponge on Nel-
Bon, so that 'he would go out and lose to
Britt ": without: knowing what was' hap
pening, i
The fight did not come off at that time,
and thereforeâ¢ the ) job could not be : put
through. Larkin says Nolan was ready at
the time to frame one on the Battling
Dane,' and that the latter, never had an
Inkling as to what was about to be doing.
PROMOTERS -* I^ E DISTURBED. f\
-Harry Corbett is muchi disturbed /.about
the stories ; that are going the rounds.
Nolan has 'â¢; evidently; planned jto make j a
clean breast and tell all he knows about
the fund sent to Sacramento. It was gen
erally known. in sporting circles last win
ter .that a? collection was being taken up
.to defeat , the Ralston bill. Corbett con
sulted his .lawyer, yesterday. He v*as reti
cent regarding the mixup with Nolan and
was noncommittal on the entire subject.
Nolan is / intent ',\u25a0..; on 'collecting all the
money he claims is due him from; Cor
bett; and; says ; there is a plan on foot to
job him and have him deposed as Nelson's
manager./' . -â¢ . â¢- . â¢
When the hat was.; passed round for

have worked under Kearn 's direction
during the past few weeks are the ones
who feel the loss most. Business Inter

spoiied Lick's chances of retaining him,
until the end of the season.
[ While losing a coach at this stage of
I the game is a serious matter, the boy Â»

Heltmuller's ' services were at once se
cured. "Heine" was first secured by the
Wilmerdlng School, but when LJck was
left without a coach he volunteered his
services. Heitmuller's leaving Wilmer

is a Lick School graduate.

fill the vacancy. He is also a good relay

NEW YORK. Sept. 14.-One of the rar

St. Gregory's Hospital.
The jaws of a man that had grown to
gether for twenty-six years were cut.open
so that within a few days he will be able
to eat his first solid meal since be was
a child."
The patient is William Case, agefl 35,
of Oneida. N. Y. In. early boyhood Case
was attacked by lockjaw and his life was
despaired of. As a last resort, he was
given heavy doses of mercury. He sur
vived the lockjaw, but .the mercury
caused an excessive salivation of the
mouth, so that his jaws remained closed,
although they were no â¢ longer JwKSfc the
surgeons call V'locked."
In time, the right jaws literally locked
together.- The front teeth were knocked \u25a0
out to permit, the", administering of. liquid
food to - young Case. Gradually he be
came accustomed to this mode of exist
ence. As he grew up he learned toartlcu
late with considerable distinctness. , l
Case married some years ago. Recently
his wife prevailed upon him to undergo an
operation. In about two weeks he.. will
be able to eat and talk like an ordinary

Steamship Delayed
by Heavy Sea
Fog.
Enters Port Early,
but Reaches the
Dock Late.
The Pacific Mall Company's steamship
Manchuria. Captain Saunders. arrived
yesterday from the Orient. She brought
JÂ£4 cabin passengers, SI in the steerage
and - k jÂ£ Asiatics. Her â¬384 tons of cargo
included Ili2 bales of raw silk, valued at
$Â£C3,(X.kj. She had on board treasure valued
.U *MOO.
The Manchuria was sighted passing in
through the Golden Gate shortly after 9
o'clock yesterday morning. She disap
i*-ar*d in a fog bank and remained at an
chor about two miles south of Point Bo
nita until 2 o'clock in the afternoon,
when the weather cleared. It was not
until 6:30 p. m., however, that she reached
the Pacilic Mail wharf.
During the operation of docking the
liner the bow line parted under a heavy
strain and one of tne broken ends struck
Chief Officer Morton a terrific blow in the
iace, knocking him senseless to the iron
deck, on which he sustained more bruises.
His left cheekbone was broken by the
bluw and he was badly shaken up. The
Uner was safely alongside, however, and
Morton had the satisfaction of knowing
that he had finished his work before the
knockout came and that he had brought
the Manchuria home even more spotless
man usual.
It was on the Manchuria that the Taft
party traveled to the Far East. On leav
ing the liner in the Orient Captain Saund
ei'S was presented with several handsome
souvenirs as marks of his distinguished
passengers' appreciation of his attention to
ihcir safety and comfort, and Chief Of
ficer Morton was not forgotten.
Miss Roosevelt was the life of the out
ward voyage and made friends with
everybody.

SPRING VALLEY
WITNESS TALKS
Engineer /ScHnylei^ Tells At
torney Partridge of Com
pany's System of Values
BASIS OF- WATER EATES
Expert Says That All That
Is Method of Calculation
Assistant ; City Attorney^ ' John 8.
Partridge yesterday forced -from the
lips of Engineer J. D.' Schuyler the ad
mission that if the Spring Valley Water
Company held* control ;of the .'only
sources of water, for, this cltyrthe com
pany would be justified in charglng v "a.ll
that the! traffic would- bear."."; â¢ '
"Suppose," asked Mr. Partridge, "that
there v? was 'no- other- *Â»>jbstltutional
source, of supply ? for â¢"thesclty, ' how
would you estimate 'the vaiiie of .the
company's 'plant?" \u25a0 \u25a0:\u25a0-â¢\u25a0': â¢ : .: _ -;
. 7 ".The company ,would; have j a 'virtual
monopoly,:. of â¢} the water "available \ for
supplying the city and the value of that
water ?, would have to .be based upon
business considerations," -replied/, Mr.
Schuyler.: .. ; -'Y-' '-. ; ' : ; o - â¢\u25a0\u25a0_\u25a0 v," ...... ..\u25a0.-;."--.
; /.'The' amount that' the citizens could
be forced to pay,"/ suggested Mr.' Part
ridge,,;"would be. all that, the ' traffic
wouldibear?" v, - :-;-".--".-.-\u25a0.. â¢>
' ."All that the traffic would bear, yes,"
replied Mr. Schuyler. v: â¢*.' . j .".
This ' line .of i; examination had been
suggested by: Mr." Schuyler' s replies to
Mr: Partridge's questions respecting the
method ; by ; which I. he. and.. Engineers
Schussler and Adams had" arrived ai
their f estimates as' to the value of the
water plaht\ and of "the cost; of con
struction of the various sub-systems;
> "Suppose," asked Mr. Partridge, "that
the value of the Tuolumne system were
twice as great as it is would that make
the valu* of .the Spring. Valley Water
Company twice as much as it is. now?"
"Of course," . waa the reply, "If that
was the \u25a0 only other- source of. supply.
That would be the; case only , 'up. to "a
certain point, that point being' what
it would cost the citizens to get water
from artesian wells or . by condensation
from sea water."
"Suppose," was asked again, "that
the cost of the Tuolumoe systeln would
beionly half of--,-what '. you-, estimate,
would that cut down the value of the
Spring Valley?"
"It would indicate that the coat of
the Spring Valley Works was unneces
sarily great and : the value would. 1 be
somewhat reduced." \u25a0
Mr. Schuyler said in answer to an
other question that he had been "In
formed that the records of the water
company would ; not show the actual
cost of construction of the Spring Val
\ley system, and when pressed by Mr.
Partridge as to sworn statements. made
before the . Supervisors at different
times by the company's representatives
as : to the actual .cost of constructfoh
he replied that he had . no knowledge
on that point. V . ' \u25a0 :
; Mr. Partridge then took up the mat
ter; of the Calaveras lands included by
the company as a portion of Its .plant.
These lands, the attorney, said, had been
purchased ; thlrty.Vears ago by the com
pany,: for} SD, per acre ami were valued
in the .company's reports at -$l5OO per
aqre. for the purpose, of fixing- 'Its ' in
come from the water, rates/ and since
the time of purchase had | never been
used i fof the purpose > of %. f urnishlhgr
water! Mr. Schuyler. said that; real es
tate, not actually in; use, but which
would b# necessary In the 'future for
supplying- this city 'with water should
be included in the} estimate. When
asked as to how long- in the future
real estate should ' be held for 1 the pur
pose of computing: Incomeâ whether for
five, ten, fifty or one hundred; years-
Mr. Schuyler replied that realty neces
sary ; r for. future needs of the city, even
though the. time of- use. should be 100
years distant should Jbe included In the
calculations . for fixing- the water: rates.
It is virtually dedicated to the'eity/ he
added,- and cannot 'be \u25a0 alienated for
other purposes. 1. ..,...'â¢
The witness was asked with refer
ence' to ; the 1 discrepancy: of ' $1,162,000
between his estimate and those of "En
gineers' Schussler', and Adams "of the
cost ; of constructional work, and ]he re
plied that as' he. did- not have i trie data
at hand he -was unable, to explain. '
: The , cross-examination, will be .re
sumed before: United , States Commis
sioner:, Heacock I this afternoon at 1
o'clock. \

SEATTLE,: Sept. 14.âAt this morn
ing's session of the Methodist confer
ence at Everett charges were read
against Presiding Elder G. A. Landen
of Tacoma, who superintends the Cen
tralia district. Tl|e charges ,.are" the
outgrowth of the old rumpus in the
Vancouver church involving Rev. T. E.
Elliott and a Mrs. Hidden. They stated
that Rev. Landen was . unfair during
the trial held at the time of the church
difficulty. The affair wa3 left to a
committee. Charges, were also . read
against Rev.' T. E.' Elliott of the Van
couver church. They are. preferred by
six members of his congregation, who
charge the minister with teaching con
trary to the Methodist' church doctrine
and also with losing his temper at a
prayer-meeting.? These; were placed In
the hands of' another committee.- \u25a0*

The Money Market.
KeÂ«rj- Clews oX New York says:
"Distinct *vldence has been ebown during
\u25a0 Jt-~i Â»"e*k cf liquidation by same of the pools
i^rhat have been most prominently operating' for
the rise: and what seems of jrreater import
ance is the fact that very little support has
been fiv^n the market by either the banking
or large speculative interests; the former, in
rÂ«<t. arpearir.s rathÂ«r to favor a \ reaction
from the high l*-vel as a desirable develop
ment on the ground that there ha* been pres
ent in the market a spirit of inflation that
bar carried prices beyond the range Justified
by present or prospective dividend distribu
tions. The advance in the I'.ar.k of England's
â¢Mscount rate on Thursday â the first advance
fine* 15*03 â In connection with an advance also
la the open market rates In London and Paris
U certainly an Indication of a distinct and
eeneral fcanienlrg in the world's money mar
ket. In which New York at the present time
is one cf the most importajit constituents. The
higher bank rate means, of I course, a check
upon the foreign credits on this side. There
is already a large amount of foreign capita!
employed in local Stock Exchange circles.
which capital will in groat measure be liquid
ated by the exports of our cotton and bread
rtuCs; but the firmer markets abroad vill
probably prevent any further foreign loans
here â ax any rate until local money rates be
ctxac more attractive â Â«od there is a distinct
rrofoebllitr that a part of the credit* already
here niay b4 witbxirawn. Reports have beea
current that! Russia is negotiating; an early
loan. thottgftSit eeeias difficult to believe that
the negotiations contemplate a transaction cal
culated to mithdra-w fusds in the immediate
future. It li more than likely that any loan
th&t may be negotiated in the near future will
contemplate the transfer of funds under more
satisfactory conditions thaa exist at present."

X*w York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. 14.â Stocks were Tree
from pressure to eÂ«Il to-day, and the money
sarket showed no evidence of urgent demand
to borrow. These were the conditions whleti
prtir.pted the room traders and some large pro
feselonal operators to work for a higher level
of price*. That transactions were mainly In
tfce hands cr the professional class of opera
tors was generally agreed and the commission
houÂ«s put out a daily plaint that business is
poor and the general puouc not in It. The
fact that the advance in prices met no serious
obstacle makes the appropâ ate description of
the market that of strength. The term is cor
rect, for tfce general underlying condition and
the upward tendency of prices asserts. Itself
whenever the "ondition or tne money market
Is tranquil. That was the case to-day, call ,
loans being rr.ade at 3 per cent or below, ,
while the rate* for timt loans -were about
steady. The tendency of events toward con- '
tractlng reserves was ignored in the presence
of this tranquillity of the money rate. The
great utrength of the business situation is '
the easy explanation of the underlying strength
of stocks. It is a very general conviction in
Wall street that if easy money "were assured
prices cf stocks would a C var.ee without diffi
culty. The enormous grain crops promised one
of the prime arguments for this view, end it
Â»-Â£s natural therefore Â» that the . day's move
irf-nt should turn to the quarter of the mar
ket where the 'grain movement would be felt
f.ret. Owing to .' the - conspicuous promise of
the com crop and dootrtlees also to the fact
that the stocks of corn-carrying railroads have
not beea active in the speculation, the corn
granger* led the movement. The buying con
verged on Missouri ,Pb cine. All of the gran
gers an-J the Southwestern group- generally,
as well &* tfce Pacifies aad trans-contlaental*.
shared in the movement, however. The opera
tion, of speculative pools was \u25a0discernible in
'\u25a0^ifrnje stocks of the 'group, as-well aÂ«> to other
*..T of the market. The absorption of
' Eri<- w&4B on . jui . enormous scale, and cause 4
thst property to be associated In the current
rumor with the open admission that negotia
tions were in progress for disposing of the
Cincinnati. Hamilton and Dayton property.
The reduction of the Bank of England rate
lr. stead of the expected advance was accepted
at a reassuring factor and revived expecta*
tions of a further Import movement of â¢ gold.
Seme of the banks were said to be calling
loans to-day, and the catn movement evidently
makes it imperative that tmnks should effect
th* showing of a further large loan contrac
tion lor the coming weekly statement. But
thf Quiet tone of the money market implies a
Â«upply of Junds from other sources, supposedly
the trust cempanies, and this was the basis
of the day's confidence in protection from dis- j
turbince of credit facilities for operations in
- stocks. Piscoirau rose m London and Berlin
and the foreign exchanges market here showed
no further important recessions. Stocks de
veloped renewed strength late in the day'and

ployes. In her lits of jealousy she would
make such a disturbance as to cause all
the employes to leave.
The wife was particularly bitter against
Mrs. Basnet, who is young and comely.
At one time. Walcott declares, his wife
proposed tiiat she and her husband take
pc:son together. When Walcott declined
the proposition she flow into a rage.
Judge HebLard attempted to effect a
reconciliation. The wife declared that she
ttss willing to forget and forgive, but
\u25a0Walc-'Jtt refused. The court allowed them
xiriti! December 21 to become reconciled.
Walcutt left the court with the Bassett
Â«cn:in and the wife went out alone.

"I had eczema on the face for five
months, during which time I was in

so disfigured I could not go out. and
it was going from bad to worse. A
friend recommended Cuticura. The
first night after I washed mv face with
Cnticura Soap and used Cuticura
Ointment and Resolvent, it changed
wonderfully. From that day I was
'able to go out, and in a month the
treatment had removed all scales and

EXGDs'EEKS ADVISED
Federal Commission \ Hears
Important Statements Re
lating to- Waterways
Before the commission of Federal en
gineers appointed to investigate conditions
pertaining to the' Sacramento, San Joa
quin and Feather rivers and their tribu
taries xepresentatives of the\ River Im
provement and Drainage Association of
California, the Chamber of Commerce of.
San Francisco, with some others, ap
peared yesterday to' give their views and
to make their, wishes known. ..'.*.?
Three. prior meetings of the commission
have been held- and communications,
which have been mentioned, were placed
on rile. There will be no more meetings
probably, and -but two days remain t for
the filing tof other matter, as the mem
bers of the commission desire to proceed
at once to prepare their report. This will
contain recommendations concerning the
work that the Government may perform
for the improvement of the" three rivers
mentioned and their tributaries.
Representing the ' River Improvement
and ... Drainage Association there were
present yesterday P. J. Van Loben Sels,
John \V. Ferris, Rufus P. Jennings and
M. J. Boggs, members of the executive
committee. The Chamber of Commerce
was represented by Captain W. H. Mars
ton and, Secretary Burks. There were
also present Cline Bull, a member of the
State Drainage Board, representing Yuba
and Placer counties; "Jesse D.- Pound
stone of the same board, representing Co
lusa County; \V. Ham Hall, formerly State
Engineer; Colonels Heuer. and Hanbury
and Captain Harts, members of the Fed
eral commission; A. Boschke, a civil en
gineer who. has devoted much study to
problems relating to the Sacramento Riv
er: \Y. P. Parks of Madera and a few
others.
VIEWS OK THE CHAMBER. 4i A
The Chamber of Commerce presented
its, conclusions in writing as a committee
report, signed by-W. H. Marston, Wil
liam Matson, Rufus P. Jennings, C. H.
Bentley and W. "R: Wheeler. This men
tioned all the obstructions to navigation
in the Sacramento, San Joaquin and
Feather rivers .and included some sug
gestions.
The Sacramento River above Sacra
mento City, so found the Chamber of
Commerce committee, admits of improve
ment to any extent for which funds can
be obtained. The general recommenda
tions of the committee were as. follows:
â¢We would suggest that the, San Joaquin River
should be deepened from Stocktoij Channel
down to a distance of approximately eighteen
miles, or below Turners Landing, and that some
practical ! means \u25a0 should tÂ» devised | for con
trolling the debris which washes Into. the San
Joaqutn Kiver from Mormon Slough during- the
fieshet season, and has of late years resulted
In blocking the main river almost effectually,
causing enormous expense and annoyance to
the steamers plying between San. Francisco and
Stockton â¢by reason 'of their being forced 'to
lighter their cargoes over thie bar at Mormon
Slough, and even then -wail for high tide be
fore they could get over the shoal.
-As the Federal Government has exclusive
Jurisdiction over navigable rivers, and by. per
mitting deterioration it has assumed a re
sponsibility In the prenÂ»M, we 'would re
spectfully recommend that all obstructoni " In
the Sacramento. San- Joaquin and Feather
rivers and their tributaries - be removed, and
further, that the channels of these: rivers be
deepened and confined In' order. to property pro
vide for present . and . further needs of naviga
tion, and in order to prevent overflow. of the.
river waters and ' consequent damage to" agri
cultural and other lands adjacent thereto, with
the understanding - that none of the work be
1 In conflict with .Government irrigation work.;
DRAINAGES ASSOCIATION^:
John W. Ferris | and P. J.- Van . Loben
Sels spoke for the River' lmprovement
and Drainage Association.. : They, made
the general claim that there are 1.200,000
acres in the valley of the Sacramento
River and its tributaries that are now of
insignificant value, but that with certain
improvements in the flood carrying ca
pacity of the rivers might be made highly
productive; ' that the. work? necessary to
effect this improvement is- of too great
a magnitude for the owners of the lands
themselves to undertake;, that fully ?25,
000.000 has been spent by individuals in
unsuccessful efforts to prevent the' over
flow of their lands, and! the conclusion"; is
forced upon the community _that the pro
vision of necessary channels to carry the
flood water is. the only correct course to
make possible the protection- of r these
lands from overflow; that the State of
California is anxious to promote the re
demption of this body of land and to con
tribute its share of the cost. of .the .work,
but realizes there are other- interests in
volved, and desires to - have - determined
the sources from which tne funds should
be derived, and a just apportionment of
the burden made;; that 'the flood carry
ing 'capacity "of the Sacramento" River
has largely deteriorated; that the. Federal
Government, reserving exclusive' Jurisdi
ction over the navigable rivers, jby suffer
ing and permitting .some of me causes of
deterioration has assumed a ; ; response
billty in the premises; that the assistance
of the State , and Federal: Governments
should be .given only/ to the. -extent 'of
making it possible for the land owners to
reclaim the lands.
'The causes' of deterioration alluded to
were mainly, â¢> minhig ; operations, \u25a0 which
caused the deposit of debris in- the rivers.
The River Improvement /and : . Drainage
Association -requested the. Federal /en
gineers, through; its representatives, : to
specify the work that' should j be 7 done to
develop the navigation I of.' the , Sacramen
to River and Its -flood carryings capacity
as a matter * separate j and ' distinct from
the - reclamation of 'lands .along', the ; river,
so that steps t might \u25a0 be ; taken ? tp . have
the work undertaken ] jointly- by > the Fed
eral and ! State Governments." \u25a0 # \u25a0 ,
,W. _ Ham ' Hall " presented a ; long pam
phk-t, which?he-:read_to" the 'commission.'
His views coincide 'generally with r" those
.of the representatives of the River. Drain^'
age and Improvement S Association." "*A;
Bocschke, M. J. BoggE, Cline 'Bull 'and '.W.
D. Park's also spoke.
