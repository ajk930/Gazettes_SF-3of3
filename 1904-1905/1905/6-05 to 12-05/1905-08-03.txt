Ibis completely tied the hands of the
administration, because there is no doubt
in the minds of Mayor Dunne and his
immediate advisers .that the majority of
the' Council is bitterly opposed to con
demnation; proceedings and would defeat
any ordinance adopting that policy.
It leaked- out to-day in the City Hall
that this is not . the caseâ that Mayor
Dunne is. as much an advocate of con
demnation aÂ«, ever, but that he has met
with such opposition as to completely
block the way. It i 3 said that he has in
his desk an opinion from the Corporation
Counsel on the subject and that the legal
department has advised him that con
demnation proceedings, unlike, an or
dinary lawsuit, require Council 1 action^
An ordinance directing the law depart
ment to start condemnation proceedings
is necessary. ' ! . \u25a0
.For some time It has been the belief in
traction circles and In the City Hall
among those not on the inside, bin who
are supporters of the immediate munici
pal ownership idea, that Mayor Dunne
has experienced a change of heart since
he took office and that he no longer is an
advocate of condemnation as an alterna
tive now that the traction companlos
have refused to name a price which he
considers reasonable.
CHICAGO, Aus. 2.-The condemnation
of the 'traction , lines as a method of
bringing about municipal ownership has
run against a stone wall. The plun ad

In the same connection. . The British,
ship Brayhead of the; Head line, after
completing her cargo in New Orleans,
stopped at' the Mississippi side of Lake
Borgne canal to get a deckload of lum

barge and rafts. \u25a0 The Brayhead was
obliged to leave without the cargo, and
the agents and the owners will, lay the
' matter before the \u25a0 British Government.
\u25a0To-day's report of the fever situation

fact that' in the past three or four d'aya

The tunnel's eventual capacity Is
placed at 150,000 tons a day of in-and-out
freight.
The most important connections are
with the Chicago and Norm western; the
Pennsylvania lines; the Chicago, Mil
waukee a/id St." Paul; the Chicago, Bur
lington and' Quincy; the Chicago and Al
ton; the Illinois Central; the Baltimore
and Ohio; the Chicago Terminal Transfer;
the Wisconsin Central lines; the Chicago
and Western Indiana, ana the Chicago
and Great Western.
Kuilw-iy freight to be handled in the
near future for nearby mercantile houses
is "to be less than carload lots.-* mer
chandise and coal." Electric elevator
connections are now being established be
tween the tunnel and the levels of the
freight houses, and the car service or the
subway is ample at the present time to
meet all ordinary demands. This ser
vice between the freighthouse^ and
the mercantile establishments cavers
for the present â¢' > an area eight
Weeks - wide amr' ten block* âlong.
The business houses making use of the
tunnel have either- put in elevators or
Vuilt their basements down to connect, so
that cars can be loaded without loss of
time. Where elevators are used, the cars
are run to them and hoisted to' the de
sired level for loading
About 115,000 tons of freight is now daily
teamed througn the congested business
district of Chicago. With the tunnel
complete, the handling of 7000 tons daily
now. 15.000 tons daily within a few weeks
and 30,000 tons daily by the first of the
year, as the officials expect, will go a long
way toward relieving the traffic conges
tion on the surface before twelve month 3
shall have passed.

LONDON, Au!T. -'.-Something of a mild

the captain is not much of a catch, but
he is a swell of the first order. Is re

the conditions framed by the Rigs;las for
the dissolution of hte union and King
Oscar selected him for the premiership,
as he considered it desirable, that the

or" the committee should prevail during
the negotiations for the carrying out of
its programme.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 2.-Surgeon
eral Wyman of the Public Health and
Marine Hospital Service said to-day that
ho had not received any official notifica
tion 6f the conflict between the State au
thorities of Louisiana and Mississippi
over ** the question ;.of quarantine. .He
added: I ''The small boats that went into
Lake'Borgne and. to the' mouth of LaKe
Bo'rgne inlet wert probably "under the
State and local authorities of Mississippi.
Surgeon Wardixi of the Public Health and
Marine Hospital Service .is .assisting in
protecting the towns of the gulf coast of
Mississippi makes the requet of the au
thorities of that State. He is using the
United biates cutter Winona to notify
.passengers from New Orleans that they
cannot land at that place â¢ and that the^
have the option of either going-, back . or
proceeding to Ship Island quarantine,
where they can be held under observation
and the.n given pratique. The bureau de
clines to take over the small vessels of
the State which are said to r have gone
Into the waters of Louisiana."
Shotgun quarantines prevail in many
parts of the far South, this emphatic
manner of stopping' refugees having been
in operation ntar Vicksburg for about a
week.
Arkansas, as well as Mississippi, is
using it militiamen as quarantine officers
and has stationed them at various points
to prevent the landing of people from in
fected-districts.
The detention camps on the railroads
outsidf- of New Orleans are tilled with
refugees. ,\The detention camp on the
Louisville and Nashville Railroad, one of
the main outlets from the gulf was locat
ed to-day, arrangements being finally
made to place the station .on the line
b* tween Louisiana and Mississippi. All
trains carry armed guards, the train in
spections extending as far north as Cairo,
111.
Mobile has tightened its protective cor
don and has ordered, in addition to disin
fection, detention of five days for all
boats coming from" Central and South
American ports.
Texarkana, on the line between Ar
kansas and Texas, has ordered a discon
tinuance of al! trains between Shreveport,
where a ease appeared last nfght at Tex
arkana.
DETKXTIOX CAMPS FILLED.
Surgeon White of the Marine Hospital
service has returned trom the Mississippi
coast, from which point he talked over
the long distance telephone with Gov
ernor Vardaman. Dr. AVhite said the
Governor had given courteous consent to
the establishment of a detention camp
on the Mississippi side of the State line
on the Loulsvilie and Nashvliie road and
would arrange for the admission to Mis
sissippi pnints of persons from New Or
kan^.who entered the camp and are dis
charged with certificates of the Federal
tiugtons." There is no longer any ob
stacle _to the movement of passengers
through Mississippi.
The question of whether Federal control
of the situation ought to be invited is still
discussed, but unless graver conditions
adse it is not regarded as. unlikely that
there will be any movement in that di
rection. Mayor Herrman to-day signed
the mosquito ordinance and it was later
rtvitwed in the official journal. It re
qums that cisterns shall be screened
within forty-tight hours by property own

Passenger and freight traffic on the

have been dropping one or more trains

De Wltte Say* Tremendous TaaU Yet
Confronts Japan.
XEW YORK, Aug. 2.â Speakingr. dur
ing his voyage on the Kaiser Wilhelm
der Grosse, of his approaching visit
to the United States, Peace Plenipo
tentiary de Wltte said:
\u25a0 I am hippy to visit America, which coun
try I ani moit anxious to know. My only
regret is that I cannot speak English, as
I should like thoroughly to appreciate the
country whose progress and development are so
interesting and instructive.
I shall also be glad to have personal inter
course with President Roosevelt, who has
reached such a. prominent position as a states
man, and to present to him the greetings of
Kmperor Nicholas. It has bÂ«en stated that
I am to test the ground for floating a Russian
loan in America and discuss the relations be
tween the two countries, especially regarding
commercial affairs. My only mission Is the
negotiation* for peace; but I am quite ready
to express my personal opinion on questions
affecting the relations between Russia and
America, with a view to further strengthen
ing the traditional frl-ndly feeling between St.
Petersburg and Washington.
The Russians have had reverses, bat this
does not signify that they have lost the power
which was known to the Muscovite before the
war, nor does It mean that Russia has be
come a. negligible quantity nor that the Jap
anese have acquired, by result of their re
cent victories, such a supremacy as to make
the Russian Empire consider thÂ«m a truly
redoubtable enemy.
De Witte recognizes the good qual
ities of the Japanese military and
naval administrative organizations and
does not believe any other European
nation would have been able to resist
Japan as Russia has. It could not be
done. He continues:
It must be taken into consideration that the
Japanese had been preparing for war for about
ten years, while Russia was entirely unpre
pared, wis-hingr for and trusting in peace. The
Japanese fought in their own neighborhood
under all favorable conditions, while the Rus
sians had to be sent 9000 versts from their
headquarters by a railroad entirely insufficient
to their needs and to fight a colonial war with
out co-efflcleÂ»ts against them. There is -not
In history anothor example of a similar dis
proportion between armies. Nevertheless, all
the foreign officers of the European armies who
followed the war are unanimous In affirming
that the Russian troops, both soldiers and offi
cers, fought with a bravery phenomenal un
der the ciicumÂ«tances.
On the sea. the Russians found themselves
constantly Inferior In conditions. The squadron
of Rojestvensky was sent out, not because the
Russians had much confidence In its success,
but because they could not renounce, from a
military and moral point of view, any chance,
no matter how* uncertain, of obtaining even a
partial victory. Suppose for a moment that
the war, instead of having taken- place In
Korea or Manchuria. ' had been fought at the
true Russian froptiers. then the â¢ Japanese
would not have been able to face the Russian
forces for more than six months. â¢â¢.'..â¢
However, even as things stand, the Japan
ese have not made such progress as Is gener
ally believed: In fact,- they would have to ad
vance four times as much as they have done
In the last year and a half to reach Russia
proper, in which case- they might consider
themselves in a position to impos* conditions
of peace. But /they are very far from this
and the more they advance northward, the
more the respective conditions of the Rus
sians and the Japanese will be reversed, v.:.-.
According to the Russian plenipoten
tiary those who do not know Russia
well oppose to these reasons the
specter of the internal condition of
the empire, imagining all kinds of
cataclysms, but even about this they
are mistaken. M. de Witte did not
wish to discuss at this time the events
in Russia, affirming, however, that they
had not the character or the gravity
attributed to them, nor can they bring
about the consequences which have been
supposed, partly by those prejudiced
apainst Russia and partly by those ig
norant of Russian internal ' affairs.
What was going on in the Muscovite
empire, he said, could not have any in- :
fluence on her foreign policy and even !
less on the continuation or cessation*
of the war. Said De Witte:
The great majority of the Russian people do
not attach to the conflict In the Far East the
importance which Is given to It In Europe and
America. It is considered as a very distant
colonial war, but the whole Russian people
would rlise as a single man the day in which
they should think that it is no more the ques
tion of a colonial war. which Is not dangerous,
but a conflict threatening the security of the
country.
De Witte indicated, notwithstanding
these views, that he did- not mean to
say that he would not make every pos
sible effort toward the conclusion of
peace, adding that he - was favorable
to peace as a Russian and as a man, I
having always worked to prevent war
and understanding that at present I
nearly the entire, world desired the end
of. the conflict. .However, he felt that!
to reach this object it was necessary!
that the Japanese should be animated {
by the same feelings; .that they should !
be convinced that peace for Russia was {
desirable, but was not at all indispens
able and that Russia would never ac
cept any conditions which would offend
her amour propre. De .Witte repeated
that he would honestly do all that his
conscience xnisrht surcest to brinsr
RUSSIA FAR FROM BEATEN.
YOUNG GROCER OF OAKLAND f
WHO SUCCfMBKD., TO 'INJURIES 'I
INFLICTED BY FOOTPADS: \u25a0 â¢ |
Cook's body was moved to the under
taking parlors of Smiley & Gallagher
in Alameda, where an autopsy, was per
formed by Dr. J. M. Shannon of this
city, assisted by Dr. J. H. Callen and
Dr. P. S. Crosby of Fruitvale. Other
physicians who witnessed the post
mortem examination were Dr. .C. G.
Bull. Dr. W. T. Lum and Dr. A. -S.
Kelly.
When the autopsy was finished Dr.
Shannon said that the immediate cause
of death was meningitis and cerebritis
resulting from . fracture ol the skull
and injury to the brain. In relating
what the autopsy disclosed, Dr. Shan
non said: "At the point of commence
ment of the fracture, and where the
weapon came in contact with the head,
there was a diamond-shaped hole in
the sliull about three Inches long and
an inch and a half wide, from which
the fragments of crushed bone had
been removed before death. We
also found evidence, on the top
of the head near the back, of a
blow that did not fracture the
skull. It is probable that it was
there where the first blow landed, and,
not felling the victim, he was struck
again over the left ear. Cook may, have
that would implicate Crowhurst,. but
without much success.
The Sheriff said this evening:
"Of course, without a statement from
Cook lam badly handicapped. He told
the doctors that Schneider and Blaker
were two of the men, but I don't know
whether this can, be used in evidence
and it leaves me simply with a cir
cumstantial case against the boys. We
have Schneider's cap, which was found
near the scene of the robbery, and alto
gether a fair circumstantial case
against them, besides which we have
their record of numerous attempts at
robbery, which, I believe, will convince
almost any jury that they are not fit
to be at large.
'"I have had several persons tell me
to-day that the lives of these boys
would not be worth a cent if I turned
them loose, and two friends have come
to me to-day with the information that
there was an attempt going to be made
to take them out of the Jail and lynch
them. I do not take any stock in such
rumors, but it just shows you what
the people in that community think
of them. And it is not so much on
account of the murder of Cook as it is
for the many other offenses they have
committed, and which makes them one
of the toughest gangs of- youngsters
that were ever banded together. They
called themselves the 'Jim Crows.'
James Crowhurst was the ringleader
and was developing into a dangerous
highwayman."
District Attorney Allen and Sheriff
Barnet were closeted with the boys for
several hours this afternoon, and Allen
was placed in possession of the evi
dence against them, besides hearing
what each one had to say for himself.
BLOW'S WERE TERRIBLE.
Light Belnsr Thrown Upon .Mysterious
$655,000 Loan to Equitable.
NEW YORK, Aug. 2.â Although the leg
islative committee appointed to investi
gate insurance methods has hardly yet
got to work, light is beginning to, break
through the mystery which has veiled the
$655,000 loan carried by the Mercantile
Trust Company for years in the names
of James W. Alexander and Thomas D.
Jordan, trustees. From an authoritative
source it . was learned to-day not only
that portions of the .funds carried under
that fluctuating account were used for
the payment of political contributions to
both great parties for defraying cam
paign expenses and that other sums were
deducted from it for lobbying expenses
and for settlement out of court of annoy
ing litigation, but also that a consider
able share of the total was used for the
purchase of eighty-nine shares of stock
of the Eauitable Life Assurance Society
at the then market rates, whdlch varied
from $4000 t0. 55000 a share.
It is explained that the purpose of this
purchase was to prevent these outstand
ing shares "from falling Into undesirable
hands," and It is believed the officers of
the society, or persons active in their in
terest, took this, course to prevent â¢ any
considerable portion of, n stock of i the
Equitable from becoming the property of
persons, who might, as stockholders,
bring troublesome suits for an account
.lng or for a partition' of the surplus In
the interest of policy-holders. .
If, as Henry C. Demlng, president of
the Mercantile Trust' Company, under
stood and so testified before Commission
er Hendricks, this' was really a loan
made to the Equitable, then the use of
any portion of it for such purpose was
improper and illegal, as the Attorney
General has averred in the suit brought
against the old board of directors in be
half of the State. â¢
VAST SUM SPENT IN POLITICS.
: Berkeley officers worked with Blaker
for an hour" this afternoon in an effort
to get some other corroborative evi
dence from what Blaker could tell them
"He showed me the clipping of a
pap.er telling about the robbery of an
old woman by the name of Nash of
Berkeley and told me that he was the
one who turned the trick."
'""When he wanted to tell us about
some job he was going to do and any
one was around he used to say 'Well, I
am going -to collect that bill to-night'
cr 'That fellow is going to pay me to
night:' He used to say that he had peo
ple working for him and he has pro
posed to me many times that we go out
and .. rake In. some old fellow with a
week's wages in his pocket.
. BOASTED OF HIS CRIMES.
Captain Blaker of the ferry-boat
Berkeley has employed Attorney A. L.
Frlck to defend his son. During the
last few days. all four of the youths
have been recltlng.more or less of their
history to Sheriff Barnet. Blaker this
afternoon talked unreservedly about
Crowhurst, saying:
"Crowhurst is the worst I ever saw.
He had an old broken pistol which he
used part of the time in his .work and
said that ' he did not care whether it
would shoot or not so long as he could
scare people into glvirig him money.
Why, he said he would use a monkey
wrench".^; -<--' \u25a0\u25a0iv-H-i
As soon as Sheriff Barnet was notified
of Cook's death he went Into confer
ence with District Attorney Allen. The
decision .was reached that Blaker. and
Schneider should be charged with mur
der.-. The formal accusation will be
made to-morrow, and either the Sheriff
or Cook's brother, Frank Cook, will
swear to r the complaint. James Crow
hurst and (Percy Pembroke, two sus
pects also held by Sheriff Barnet, will
be detained pending further develop
ments. Both have confessed to hav
ing held up Ed Stanley^a Fruitvale bar
ber, one night last winter and taking'
$25 from him, and a charge of highway
robbery can be placed against them
for this offense.
SUSPECTS WILIi BE CHARGED.
The 'injuries were such as to indicate
that the blows inflicted were from a blunt
Instrument and were numerous and of
much force. The autopsy report will be
a vital portion of the evidence in the case.
During a few lucid moments several
days ago Cook indicated to Dr. Callen
very strongly that Schneider and Blaker
were his assailants. Whether his condi
tion was such as will permit the use of
his fleeting statements in court is a
question the authorities have in hand.
Dr. J. HÂ« Callen, who had charge of
the case, was with the patient night and
day, but the case was -hopeless.
An autopsy held this afternoon at the
Morgue in Alameda disclosed clearly the
fatal nature of the wounds. The force
used had fractured the entire front of the

Jean lvorostovetz, who is one of M.

General Termoteff, the leading mili

I retain a very good remembrance of my
former sojourn In America, where I was in
1898 as Russian military representative with
the American troops during the Spanish Amer
ican War. At Tampa 1 had the honor of
being presented to Mr. Roosevelt. I remained
In Cuba until the fall of Santiago. During all
that time I received the best Impression of
the American army, of which I admired the
heroism as well as the spirit and discipline
and the exceptlenal smartness. I shall, there- ,

America.
M. Pokotiloff, who is 40 years of age.
Is an expert on Chinese, Mongolian and
Manchurian affairs and has had much
experience in connection with Russian
work in the Far East.
M. Pokotiloff does not regard the
Chinese boycott as likely to prove a
serious movement It has not Govern
ment sanction, he said, and he was
of the opinion that more prominence
was given to the movement in America
than in China.
When asked if his appointment had
anything to do with the proposal of
any arrangements at the peace con
ference in regard to the Chinese East
ern Railway, he having been formerly
adviser to the administration of that
railway, Pokotlloff said he did not
know what would be done. As to the
statements made in Japan that he was
sent by Russia in order to make some
arrangement to save the railway for
Russia or to secure Chinese control, he
said such statements had presumably
arisen because of his former connec
tion with the administration of the
railway.

Pokotiloff declined to discuss the peace
Question; stating he did not know any

Peking to succeed the late Paul Lessar

Is fn compliance with the American people's
desire for i>ea.cr. of which President Roosevelt
was tha authorized exponent, that his Majesty
the Czar has empowered me to come hither and
\u25a0 the conditions which our gallant ad
versary deems neceesary and adequate as a
basis for peace negotiations.
I need hardly point out th&t It Is my ardent
<!<rssre that the two chivalrous countries, wbi>
CrÂ« bt-came acquainted on the field of battle,
may have found In each other's sterling quali
ties motives powerful enough to cultivate that
eerjuaintanceship until It ripens into lasting
f r!endÂ£hfp. Meanwhile, however, the terms of
fered must first be ascertained, weighed aud
Judged admissibly by Russia before she can
proceed ta formal negotiations.
Hitherto, as you are aware. Jt_waÂ« customary
la cases like this to settle all such prelimina
ries â¢ before thÂ« meeting of the plenipoten
tiaries. whosÂ« task was to come .to a final
agreement on the matters under discussion.
Now, 'the very fact that hiÂ» Majesty the Czar
consented to take a -course Involving a depart
ure from this ancient diplomatic usage and to
Appoint a mission to learn the nature of our
fcrave enemy's terms Is an eloquent token of
, the friendly feeling which he and his subjects
< continued to cherish toward the people of the
"United ' States. I say- "to cherish," because at
no. experience of our history have our tradi

cthir tn*a cordial." And no.w, I should like to
"cay.' and to prove to your .people, who live less
iin'th* past than In the present aad the future,
that it is the fervent wish of the Kmperor and
the people of Russia further to strengthen the
ties of friendship which have itherto existed
between the two nations.
It is in virtue of that sincere desire that his
Majesty the Czar, .waving all other considera
tions, has unHesitatingly accepted the cordial
invitation of your first citizen and genial leader.
And' if my mission should prove in al] other re
rpects barren and the endoavor to find a common

however, by a delegation from the Slav

De Witte enjoyed his trip up the harbor.
He niingrled freely, with the hundreds of
passengers who crowded the deck of the

to be Quite unaware of it. -It was a tfeau

Everything seem-d to interest him. The
towering sky line as he passed the Bat

and the activity which he .saw on every.

quiet way he showed genuine enthusiasm
to those of his, suite who stood.near him

There was a prompt and characteristic
letter from the President, and following
is its actual wording:
"OYSTER BAY, U 1., July 2.-Mrs.
Wade Hamptonâ My Dear Madame: You
need not feel badly at all about causing
me any annoyance, for your explanation
of the matter was so frank and straight
forward as to put the whole thing right,
and I have not felt it necessary for me to
say anything more. I have no power to
prevent people writing about me what
ever they choose, ?.nd then there are hun
dreds of photographs of mine of all kinds
which can be obtained everywhere and
which appear in every sort of publica
tion. It must be distinctly understood,
however, that I, of course, give no au
thorization for either picture or article,
and in This particular case I would very
much prefer if nothing whatever about
me appeared, and hope nothing will ap
pear. Sincerely yours,

NEW YORK. Aug. 2.â President Roose
velt in no uncertain words has distinctly
set his stamp of disapproval on the pub
lication in Fads and Fancies of any ref
erence to himself. Colonel Mann has
stated that the > President gave his con
sent to the publication, and the latter
made it plain that there had been a mis
understanding.
Then, in the explanations that followed,
it was made public that Mrs. Wade
Hampton had acted as intermediary, and
later, deploring the misunderstanding, re
cently wrote to the President 'at Oyster
Bay. Mrs. Hampton said in part in her
letter:
SAN JUAN, P. R., Aug. 2.â As an out
come of the longshoremen's strike for an
Increase of wages to 25 cents an hour,
which has been in progress for a month,
the greater portion |of San Juan was
under control of a mob between 7 and
9 o'clock last night. The mob, of which
there were about 1000 armed persons, dug
up paving blocks and stones and with
these and other missiles rushed through
the streets, fighting the police, who were
armed with rifles ana fired scores â¢of
shots, but mostly Into the air." One per
son was killed and there are forty wound
ed in the hospitals, three or four of whom
may die.
At S o'clock, while the main police force
was engaged with the rioters, another
mob, mainly composed of young men
and boys, threw stones at the arc lights
in the main streets, with the result tHat
nearly the entire city was in total dark
ness all night.
At 9 o'clock the mob sought refuge in
a disreputable district, In which there
was no police. This district, however,
was surrounded by police and mounted
squads patrolled the city fpr the remain
der of the night. At midnight the police,
who number only 100, had the situation
under control.
At noon to-day the city was quiet, and
the police, it is believed," will be able to
cope with the situation. Carti-oers were
on the roofs commanding the streets in
the disreputable. districts. Governor Win
throp said:
"I am going to have order in San Juan.
If the police should prove insufficient, I
propose to call for soldiers and marines.
Thirty-five of the leaders have been ar
rested." r i

Company, which employs more than one
half of the longshoremen on strike at San

strikers numbered not more than 250 al
together. They are natives. No damage
to the company's property has been re
ported as a result of the riot. The com

that an opposition telephone company to

not .wanted here. The matter was de
cided Con the question of offering for sale
the franchise as requested by the inde
pendent company in which San Francisco
capitalists are interested. The matter
came vp r twice before, but the Sunset
Company headed off the sale of the fran
chise at the last moment each time, after
nearly $200Q had been forfeited.
The question of readvertising the sale
came up last night and it was decided
not to offer the privilege for sale again.
This action heads off any efforts of the
new concern, to enter the field for the
next two years and is locally regarded
as being inspired by the Sunset Company.
The citizens generally favor the new com
pany and much unfavorable comment has
been heard on the action of the city
fathers. It is believed the independents,

in the Bennington disaster, surprised his
friends last night by taking a bride. He
married Miss Isabella Parades,, a cook in

marriage license was not issued until
nearly midnight and the wedding took
place shortly after.
Turpin is 2S years old and was a Eallor
on board the Maine when that ship was
blown up in Havana harbor. He re
ceived Injuries which laid him up in the
hospital for six months. He was sent to
France by the United States Govern

put in his head. At the time of the ex

was on decK. He was blown into the
water and swam ashore, but later re
turned to the ship and rescued nine of
his comrades from death. His father was
a Turk and his mother was a native ot
Jamaica, in which country Turpin was

VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 2.â Among the

bound to Washington to discuss with>the
Chinese Minister C,hinese-American trade
\ matters with special reference, to the i boy
! cott now being enforced against "Amer-
I lean goods in ChinU. .' â¢ -}, ;r* "
In an interview one of the: Chinese said
that, although they had no official stand
j ing, they wished to lay' certain matters
I with regard to the -difficulties that had
| arisen before the Ch-nese legation in the
United States. Lo Man Leung. said there
was a strong feeling at present growing
in force in the coast cities of China for
a union with Japan. /
Although arrivals from China state the
! boycott against American goods is not
a serious menace, the Cfhinese newspapers
are filled with anti-American reports.
The Peking Commercial Guild has
drawn up a special paper and millions
of copies are to be circulated to give pub
licity to the boycott. The Guild, with
representatives from every Chinese
province but Fukien, has made an agree
; ment that no member will purchase
American goods on pain of a large fine.
A mass-meeting of delegates from twenty
six Chinese colleges was held at Tien
| tsin to further the boycott. It was de
cided to appoint a, number of students
from each school to travel and . lecture
upon the boycott. Large numbers of
placards are being posted I throughout
Southern China, the language of which
is in cases strongly anti-foreign..
When a delegate of the Chinese boycott
movement against America was explain
ing to students in Canton schools the na
ture of the agitation, he pointed out that
many students wore tunics made of
American cloth. These were at once torn
from the backs of the students.

YOUNG WOMAN OF PACIFIC
GROVE WHO YESTERDAY BE
CAME A BRIDE.
The bridegroom is a son of P. L. Truitt,
a real estate dealer of Lorapoc, and is
now a senior in the dental college of the
University of California,
The color scheme for the wedding was
white, pink and green. ThÂ« gown of the
bride was light tan crepe de Paris over
taffeta silk, trimmed with lace. The
bridesmaid was Miss Ava Neighbor, the
twin sister of the bride. The bridegroom
was attended by Frank Neighbor, the
brother of the bride, as best man. The
couple will spend a month in Southern
California, after which San Francisco
will be their residence.
PACIFIC GROVE, Aug. 2.â The mar
riage of Miss Ada Florence Neighbor of
Pacific Grove and Samuel Paul Truitt of
Lompoc took place here to-day at high
noon. The bride is one of the "twin"
Neighbor daughters, her father, J. H.
Neighbor, being one of the oldest and
most respected residents of this city.
She was educated in the schools of Pa
cific Grove and at the Conservatory of
Music of the University of the Pacific,
and has always been an active member
of local social and musical circles.
Late last evening the lock on the man's
cell was found to be so worn that the
door could be sprung open with little
more than ordinary pressure. This was
remedied and it was not thought that any
other plan of escape had been planned.
Then two saws were found in the cell.
The dynamite, it is believed, was con
sealed about his clothes. Three more
sticks of dynamite were t found in the
cell this morning. Chesterfield has kept
good his word that he would never be
taken to the penitentiary alive.
Mrs. Luella Chesterfield was arrested
this afternoon and has confessed that she
carried the dynamite, saws and guns to
her husband in his cell that he might
gain his liberty. Mrs. Chesterfield went
to the jail shortly after 2 o'clock this
afternoon and asked to see her husband.
Although for five hours newsboys on the
streets had been crying the news of his
effort to blow up the jail, the woman
feigned Ignorance of what had occurred.
She was taken to police headquarters and
fifteen minutes in the sweat box broke
her down. With tears streaming down
her cheeks, she informed the officers that
she knew. all about what had happened.
At her husband's solicitation, she said,
she had made three trips to the County
Jail where, as. the wife of the criminal,
she was given every privilege and allow
ed to see him alone. On two of. these
trips she passed him five sticks of dyna
mite and on the third the two revolvers,
saws and carbolic acid. She declared she
loved the man and would do anything
to help him gain his liberty. She is now
locked up without a charge.
Chesterfield is at the Wayside Mission
with the bullet still in his head. He has
but one - chance in a hundred for re
covery, f
SEATTLE; Aug. 2.â After dynamiting
the County Jail and entirely wrecking his
cell In the hope of being able to effect
his escape, Jack Chesterfield, at 4 o'clock
this morning, fired six shots at the jail
ers who attempted to restore order In
the cell and then sent a bullet into his
brain. The wound, it is thought, will
prove fatal. Chesterfield was to have
been taken to the penitentiary this morn
ing to serve a three years' sentence for
assaulting a young girl.
Chesterfield had two revolvers in his
hands. and fired at every one who ap
proached him. He was completely barri
caded and was able to keep the jailers
at bay until the Fire Department was
called out and his cell flooded. It was not
until the man was standing in two feet
of water that he gave up and shot him
self. Game to the last breath, he. never
left his feet and was- taken leaning
against his cell, though a leaden ball had
torn a hole through his head.
Chesterfield was secretely married in
the jail three weeks ago. Since then hi 3
wife has been given unbounded freedom.
She abused the confidence of the officials
and supplied her husband with what she
thought, would be his means of escape,
but which have proved to be implements
of self-destruction.

he had passed. "Dr. Dunn told me that he could, not
answer," said the young graduate, "because the board haa
instructed them all not to talk. But he did tell me of one
fellow who had taken the examinations in Los Angeles,
failed in eight subjects and passed, while, another student
had failed in only two and got through."
EXCITING CLASH NARROWLY AVEIITED.
Instantly there was a hubbub. Attorney W. S. Braun
was on his feet claiming that Dr. Dunn had given away
secrets of the board which he had sworn to keep
â Dr. Dunn was leaning over the table excitedly.
It looked as though there might be a clash, ,but Commis
sioner Devlin Interrupted with more questions and the
proceedings resumed their former quiet.
Considerable time was spent in attempting to find the
source from which Dr. P. S. Coke, a member of a Market
street dental firm, got his information concerning the
students who were successful In passing tile State examina
tions. Several witnesses swore that this man told them
that they had passed and one was told that he failed to
get through. Not one of them could tell why Dr. Coke
should know whereof he spoke, but they all seemed to take
his word regarding their standing as final.
Shortly after the commission resumed Its session in
the afternoon yesterday an attempt was made to show that
two of the witnesses had agreed upon a story to tell which
would "settle things," but the promised sensation came to
naught when these witnesses stated their entire conversa
tion. Dr. Smith had gone over to Dr. Howatt, told him that
he was to take the stand next, and told him to tell he
commission that he (Howatt) received the questions from
Smith. Both admitted the statements alleged, but said
that there was utterly no significance attached to them.
The matter was dismissed.
WOULD NOtVsICHV THE AFFIDAVIT.
Syverson told the commission the facts regarding the
attempt to have- him .sign an affidavit exonerating every
member of the board from irregularities in the giving of
the examinations. He said that Dr. Balrd had asked him to
do this, but had told him that It was merely voluntary on
his part. Dr. Jacoby also requested him to sign such an
affidavit, but he declined because he believed there had
been irregularities. He also told the commission of the
coming of a man to his place of work in the Richmond
District who represented that he was employed by a firm
of lawyers retained by the commission to gather the evi
dence. The man's name was Tucker, but except for the
two days that he called Syverson had not seen him. Tucker
got all the Information that Syverson had.
The first witness called in. the second day's hearing
was Dr. Lew T. Smith, who took the stand.on Tuesday. He
went over his former testimony in great detail, telling just
how he happened to receive the examination questions from
Dr. E. H. Howard, demonstrator of anatomy of the Col
lege of Physicians and Surgeons. He admitted, however,
that nine of these ten questions given in the final examina
tion had been suggested to him by Dr. Howard, but he
stated that he attached no peculiar significance to this, as
questions were often guessed.
DR. COKE TELLS HIM HE PASSED.
Several other recent graduates were disposed of
quickly; Dr. Bert Mallet, Dr. R. F. Morehead and Dr.
Robert Young all stating that they had seen the questions
which are alleged to have been given out Improperly Dr.
Young said that Dr. P. S. Coke had told him that he was
successful in passing the examinations before the State
Board. Dr. T. H. Richmond testified that he was in Dr.
Swain's room at 160 Golden Gate avenue when Dr. Howatt

left," said Â»Dr. Richmond, "Dr. Leslie told me that he

HUSBAND IS PARDONED
NEW YORK, Aug. 2. â Two collisions,
one of which snapped a propeller
blade, were reported by the steamship
Minneapolis, which arrived to-day
from London. The first mishap oc
curred In a mix-up between the Min
neapolis, another liner, a tramp ship
and a fishing smack Saturday, July 22,
in the English Channel. Captain
Thomas F. Cates of the Minneapolis
says his steamer was wedged so tight
ly in the trap that his only chance was
which of the other ships to run down.
He chose the fishing smack as the least
dangerous and struck this boat a glan
cing blow, whicn carried away parts of
her rigging, but did no other serious
damage.
Two days later, Captain Cates be
lieves, the Minneapolis ran over tho
remains of a submerged wreck. Early
Saturday morning, while the passen
gers were asleep, the ship shivered as
from a shock to her hull and one blade
of her propeller snapped off. Pas
sengers wero awakened and ran on
deck in alarm and the steamer came to
a Btop. After short delay, however, she
proceeded on her way.

MUSCATINE. lowa, Aug. 2.-John D.
Rockefeller was bitterly arraigned in an
address given at the opening of the Co
lumbus Junction Chautauqua this evening
by Governor Robert La Folletto of Wis
consin. La Follette denounced John D.
Rockefeller as the greatest criminal of
the age, and repeated his former decla
ration that if Rockefeller lived a mil
lion years he could not atone for his
crimes.
"I hear John has been attending pray
er meeting again." said the Governor.
"Well, now, that Is nice. I tell you, by
the Eternal! If he lived a million years
he could not atone. He gives with many
hands, but he also robs with many hands.
He is the author of the odious rebate sys
tem, In which he has built a trust on oil,
a system which wa* rejected by the mod
ern better class of financiers, but of late
has been accepted. Rockefeller Is branch
ing out and in time the banking system
of the country will bo under his control.
"His prayer meetings will not save him.
Ho will be judged in God's timeâetern
ityâand the place you can guess."
Thousands heard the address.

Among the matters which the Presi

sidered was the prosecution of the
meat packers under the Indictment in
Cnicago. Tho â¢ prosecution will bo
pressed vigorously by the Government.
OYSTER BAT, L. 1.. Aug. 2.âAttor
ney General Moody,' who oame here
yesterday to visit President Roosevelt,
loft to-day for Washington to give per
sonal attention to the Inquiries being
made Into the scandals in the Military
Department. Mr. Moody also discussed
with tho President a variety of othor
topics. Tho declination of W. W. Cot
ton to accept the appointment of Unit
ed States District Judge for tha dis
trict of Oregon was takon up, but no
agreement was reaohod as to a further
appointment. Judge Cotton did not
qualify after his appointment, simply
indicating to the President that, on ac
count of his private business arrange
ments, ho found himself unablo to ac
cept the tender of office.
Mr. Moody said . that hÂ» and tho
President considered at yesterday's
general discussion of the laws tho
bearings of the United States to spe
cial cases, and tho amendments of
criminal laws of the United States.
They agreed, he said, that Congress
ought to make certain amendments to
the existing statutes, as tho laws under
whioh tho courts are now operating
render it often difficult to reach a man
who might be guilty of wrong-doing.
As an illustration of this Mr. Moody
said it was far more difficult to take a
man from orio United States court's
jurisdiction into another United States
court's jurisdiction than it Is for the
State of Maine to get a criminal want
ed from the State of California.
The Soo canal has developed the vast
mineral wealth of the Lako Superior re
gion, and has furnished a cheap and con
venient outlet for the transportation of
grain, flour and other products to the
East and to Europe. It has helped to
build up great industrial centers at De
troit, Cleveland and Buffalo, has aided In
making Plttsburg the greatest iron and
steel center in the world, and has con
tributed materially toward giving the
United States primacy In the production
of Iron, steel and copper.
The tralilc by way of the Soo canals,
American and Canadian, during 1904, was
32,000,000 net tons, 27,000,000 of which was
through the American canal. The traffic
of the Suez canal in 1904 was 12,000,000 net
tons. This represented a large part of
the commerce of Europe with Asia and
some of that between the United States
and Asia.
The Sault Ste. Marie snip canal was
completed by the State of Michigan in
1855. Thia ship channel, the connecting
link between Lake Superior and the lower
lakes, was transferred to the United
States Government in 1870. Since the Gov
ernment took charge of the waterway,
vast Improvements have been undertaken,
the canal having been widened and deep
ened several times. It is now considered
the busiest of the world's artificial wat
erways.
Hon. Rodolph Lemieux, . lSolicitor-Gen
eral of Canada, and a party of Canadian
officials also assisted in the ceremonies.
The first day was devoted to naval and
military parades, Indian sports and ex
hibitions and a reception by Governor
Warner to the other distinguished guests,
followed by a magnificent illumination of
fireworks.
To-morrow the commemoration exer
cises will be held and addresses will be
made- by President Peter White, of the
semi-centennial celebration committee.

With the city crowded with thousands of
visitors and with hundreds of yards of

buildings on both the American and
Canadian sides of the St. Marys River, a
salute at sunrise from tho Government
ships in the harbor opened the two days
celebration of tho semi-oenTennlal of the
opening of the St. Marys ship, canal,
which connects Lake Superior with tha
lower lakes. More traffic passes through
these flocks than through any similar
waterway in the .world. In 1904, 38,000
passengers .were transported through tho
canal and a total of 31.546,106 tons of
freight with a value of $340,000,000. - â¢
Tho two days of tho celebration were
declared legal holidays on both the Amer
ican and Canadian sides of the river and
business has been suspended wherever
possible. Owners of lake vessels arranged
the trips of many at the largest freighters
on the lakes so that they would pass
through the canal during the celebration.

Strong evidence was brought out in yesterday's session
of the commission appointed by Lieutenant Governor An
derson to investigate the conduct of cortain members of
the State Board of Dental Examiners which seemed to dis
' prove the irregrularities alleged to exist.
i Two witnesses, both graduates of the University of
California, who took the examination in anatomy, testified
that the list of questions alleged to have been given out
by Dr. A. B. Mayhew of Palo Alto to enable certain students
to pass the coming examination which he was about to
! give was general in its nature. They swore that these
questions covered the entire subject of anatomy and that
with a perfect understanding of them a student could
hayÂ© passed any examination covering tho lino of work.
In proof of this came the questions written for the
examination in anatomy and with them the written memor
andum of the questions which Dr. Smith received before
the examination. It is tuis second list of questions which
was so nearly like the examination that a State investiga
tion -was brought to find out whether or not they could
have been given out to Dr. Mayhew. The original exami
nation is as follows:
DB. MATHEWS AXATOMT EXAMINATION.
IâDefine1 â Define osteology?
2 (a) â Give the number of bones in the vertebrae?
(b) â How many In the cervical, dorsal, lumbar,
sacral, coccygeal?
â¢ 3 (a) â Give the number of bones In the face?.
(b) â Name the bones in the face and the number of
each?
4 (a) â Give the names of the muscles of the superior
maxillary region?
(b) â Of the inferior maxillary region?
(c) â Of the inter-maxillary region?
(d) â Of the tempero maxillary region?
BâlnB â In the extraction of teeth, what muscles concern
us the most and cive us the reasons why?
6 â Of what artery is the lingual a branch?
7 â At what point does the internal carotid artery com
mence?
BâWhat8 â What nerve is the largest of the three branches of
the inferior maxillary nerve?
9 â Give the origin of the inferior maxillary nerve?
10 â Give the action of the genlo-glossus muscle?
ALLEGED IRREGULAR QUESTION'S.
: The notes taken by Dr. Richmond from the questions
read by Dr. Smith which brought about the investigation
are as follows:
IâMuscles1 â Muscles that raise tongue?
2 â Name muscles of tongue?
3 â Branches of Inf. Max. Dlv. sth (inferior maxillary
division)?
4 â Names muscles, trouble in Ext.? â¢
sâGive5 â Give origin of Seventh Flor. 4th interib?
6 â Give bones face?
7 â Give muscles of face?
BâMuscles8 â Muscles attached to Inf. Max.?
9 â Number of ribs?
There had been fifteen of these questions given out,
but Dr. Richmond said that the rest had been lost. He
swore that he noticed the similarity of this early list with
those in the examinations and for the reason that he feared
that he would later be called upon to testify he had kept
the copy.
Dr. "W. A. Lane testified that with little hesitation Smith
had told him on the day that he showed the questions that
they came from Dr. Howard. This was to show that Smith
had not made up the story after the trouble broke out.
GIVEN LIST BY DR. E. H. HOWARD.
Dr. Lew T. Smith stated that he had received this list
of questions direct from Dr. E. H. Howard, demonstrator
of anatomy of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and
that Dr. Mayhew did not give them to him. His evidence
was vitally backed up by the words of Dr. G. A. Cane of
Petaluma, who showed to the commission a list of ques
tions which this same Dr. Howard had given him. When
they were read it was evident that they covered the ques
tions given by Dr. Mayhew in the examination even more
directly than did tho list over which tho Irregularity Is
suspected.
Another bit of interesting testimony developed under
the questioning of Dr. G. A. Cane. He said that Dr. Howard
conducted a private class In anatomy, for which those who
attended paid a fee. This course was intended to help pa?s
tho examination In anatomy, regarded aa one of the hardest
given, and that the questions here given covered most of
tho questions which were given by Dr. Mayhew In the
examination.
Dr. A. Syverson's testimony proved to bo the sensation
of tho day. He told the commission of the interview that
ho had with Dr. J. M. Dunn, member of the State Board,
and with Dr. R. H. Cool, constituting one faction in this
internal fight. In this conversation Syverson asked whether

The work of renovating Encina Hall,

extensive. A squad of between thirty
and forty workmen has been engaged
in the work for the* last six weeks.
Except for a few minor details, the
dormitory is again ready for active
service and will be opened shortly.
The most important of the improve
ments is the complete resviringr- and ad
justment of the electric lights through
out- the structure. The painters have
also worked extensive changes.
In all the rooms the walls and cell
ings have been kalsomined and paint
ed. All woodwork has-been retouched
and oiled. The furniture- came in for
its share of attention, every piece be
ing revarnlshed and repaired where
necessary: The floors of many rooms
and corridors showed signs of wear.
These piaces were replaced by new ma
terial. â¢ The plumbing has been ex
amined and put in order.
The regulations governing the rent-
Ing of rooms "in Encina Hall have been
slightly modified. Students hereafter
wishing to engage a room do so with
the understanding that, they will.- re
main in the dormitory at least one

it will solve the problem which haa. lonjj
prevented the building of a. resort on the
San Mafeo beach. This beach la admir
ably fitted for such a. purpose, aa the fa
cilities for bathing are splendid and the
climate is ' unsurpassed on the- peninsula. !

With the aid of his sister, who mort
gaged her home for $4500, City Treasurer
John E. McDougald was enabled yester
day to pay the full amount of the short
age caused In his office through the cash
ing by Deputy Treasurer Devoto of a per
sonal check of Defaulter Edward J.
Smith, for $15,590 08.
McDougald had notified the Mayor that
he would settle the balance of the de
ficit by the first of this month, having
already "replaced the sum of 510,575 08 In
the city treasury through the assistance
of friends and labor organizations.
The National Surety Company, which
was on Devoto's bond for J7500, claimed
exemption from liability because a clause
in the bond relieved it from responsibility
if any of the city's money was lost
through the "error of judgment" of the
official insured. However, a letter was
sent from, the head office of the company
In New York advising its local repre
sentatives that when McDougald had
raised $14,000 of the shortage he would re
ceive a check for $1000 to help make the
amount good.
The following letters were sent to
Mayor Schmitz and City Attorney Long
apprising them of the fact that the en
tire shortage had been made good:
"Hon. E. E. Schmitz, Mayorâ Sir: I beg

"Even though Ruef does succeed In
again securing control of the labor con
vention," said a member of the anti-
Rut f Union Labor league last evening,
"it will still leave within our hands the
power to show him that we now realize
that iie has degraded us to his own uses
for tne last four years. We wiil give him
a terrible fight in the convention, but if
he succeeds in renominating' Schmitz it
means that our fight has just begun."
Police Commissioners O'Grady and Po
heim recently made the rounds of the
Thirtieth district In an automobile to en
courage the Ruefters.
Night before last the San Francisco Re
publican League delegation of the Thir
tieth met at 107 Eighth street and in
dorsed the candidacy of John McDougald
for Mayor. Four delegates on the oppo
sition ticket pledged their support to the
regulars. The delegates will meet to-
Some facts regarding the brief history
of this, the anti-Ruef force of the Union
Labor party, is timely as well as inter
' esting. When the announcement was
â¢made that a Union Labor ticket would be
put in every precinct In the city in op
? position to the so-called union labor men
that Abe Ruef had selected, without ad
' vke from the organizations that were
supposed to control the j?reat aggregation
of labor in San Francisco, hundreds of
* applications for places on the anti-Ruef
ticket flowed in. Out of these the neccs
"Bary number was selected.
Last evening the proofs of the tickets,
fresh from the press, arrived at the anti-
Ruef headquarter?. An inspection of them
â¢v.'hs jiiade with the discovery that not one
man named ' thereon had â .iccted from
his principles. A further Inspection" of
* the roster showed that the force that hiis
.iv vi?w the r< lifting of union labor to the
place from which it 'has been dragged by
R*uef and Schmitz is growing steadily. It
has assured proportions that now makes
It certain that Ruef and his so-called la
.. bor following^ will not dare step from
their first line of intrenchments to aid
* Ruefs pseudo Republican allies in their
futile fight to reach the convention of the
â¢city's dominant party.
It is now 'certain (hat Ruef, if he
xvisbes to even renominate Schmitz, must
throw all of his forces against the anti
"Ruef Union Labor party. If he does not
It is quite probable that he will loso even
the control of the gathering he has mis
.^lrectcd fof his own uses for the- last
tour years. This would mean the and.
The destiny of this opposition to the
Ruef wing cf the Union Labor party is
in the hands of strong men who are di
recting Its affairs from headquarters at 3
Efifijr street. Timothy Sullivan, a mem
ber of the Labor Council, is at the desk
and last night he announced that his
forces were ready for the advance.
â¢' EAGER TO FlfiHT BOSS.
The union labor forces of San Francisco
are split asunder. The Teutonia Hall in
cident, .engineered by. the Schmitz forces
to strengthen his crumbling power, j has
had an effect .its promoters never dared to
coctemplate. It supplied the real labor
element pÂ£ the United Labor LeaguÂ© with
thÂ« necessary moral courage to break the
Bhackies that long bound it, not to the
principles cf union labor, but ' to Abe
Ruef. The result is that on next Monday
Â« full Ucket of 172 union labor delegates
will be announced through the public
press to stand at the polls Tuesday in
firm, unswerving opposition to the pres
ent administration.
\u25a0 And these 172 delegates will be union
labor men beyond Question. Every man
of them has his paid up union card; forty
cf them are members of the San Fran
cieco Labor Council and. ten of them
\u25a0 members of the Building Trades Council.
Backed as . they are, not by hundreds
only, but by thousands of the men that
.helped place Ruef In powerâ thereby lnno

all were strugglingâ theÃe delegates stand
In unbroken line for the right.

A guessiog contest .is not required to
enable one to name the politician that
suggested the interview with the cigar

that one in your line of business should
oppose Mr. Iluef. It is not. good policy
on rour part to fight Ruef. I would like

. '"T > HE organization of an oil concern, backed by' ample capital,
. I to compete with the Standard Oil' Trust, may be the begirfning
"\u25a0" of the end of Mr. Rockefeller's control of the oil business of this
country. With the Kansas, Indian Territory and Texas oil fields in
!its control and an output of 10,000 barrels a day, the new compaoy
should make it lively for the old. Whether the expectations of its
performance will be justified or not, the future must disclose. If "it
proceed, under a "gentlemen's agreement," to avoid the richest ter
ritory of the Standard, it will disappoint the country. ,
â¢:â¢ It should have statutory backing. If Congress would enact,
using its constitutional control of interstate commerce, that when
a combination controlling prices puts them down at any competing
point in the United States, its prices at every point in the United
States shall be reduced to the competing price at any one point, the
new company would, have the Standard on its knees in three months.
Such a statute would rob Rockefeller-of the weapon he has always
used to crush competition.
" With that taken out of his hands and freight rebates made im
possible, the Standard would soon be rendered harmless. The in
dependent oil owners of California would benefit equally with the
new company. Every State in the Union might be induced to fol

gratifying" that the independent oil producers of Kansas have been
â¢ able to promote the rival company, for the oil interests of that State
have' suffered greatly from the policy of the Standard.
As.jnew fields are discovered every effort should; be made to
keep them from falling into Rockefeller's control. Heretofore this
has not been easy because there was no other, place for a new field

COMPETITION WITH THE STANDARD.
And the quality of English love is fur
ther affected by that combination of cir
cumstances which makes England,
through her colonies, such a world power.
In the first place, England is an island,
and very small, which means that she is
conservative and retains the customs and
prejudices of her past. And as her pop
ulation grows she sends her young men
away to" the colonies, where usually they
marry and settle down. Both of . these
things tend to give women an inferior
status matrimonially.
Said one English ' girl to me naively:
"We have to be awfully nice to the men,
for there aren't enough of them here to
LONDON. July 16.
IT was an English scientist who was
responsible for the disconcerting'
discovery published a while ago, that,
by evidence of llgures unearthed from
the crypts of statistical knowledge, there
can be in the whole world only 125 gen
uine affinities, and that the chances which
one has of. finding and wedding an affin
ity averages only one in four millions.
To the British public this state of
things would be. I am sure, less disquiet
ing than to Americans. The latter look
upon the ideal marriage of perfect wedded
companionship as part of their ideal of
freedom. The former regard sentiment
as a secondary consideration in wedlock,
their point of view is almost Homeric in
the supremacy that it accords to man,
and the inferior position which it deals
out to woman as her historic portion, and
in Its acceptance' of love as a primitive
passion of humanity. ]
An Englishman treats marriage as a
fact; he does not trifle with it as a the
ory. When he marries he does so for
good solid reasons; he is rarely lured
into a matrimonial bog by the light al
lurement-6f some will-o'-the-wisp fancy.
In a land where mere money commands
a disproportionate degree of . respect, he
feels no shame in estimating a match by
commercial stajidards.
After all, the character of love, like
the character of food, is largely a matter
of geography and climate. The , English
temperament is not romantic. How could
It be? You can't expect romance of a
people whobreathe fog t\yo-thirde of the

Chicago?" was the question that greeted
the conductor every time he appeared.
From an expected arrival at 1 o'clock the
time shifted from 2 to 3, from 3 till 4, and
finally till 5:30.
At last, worn out with the long vigil,
all the passengers in the chair car but
the three in the corner fell asleep. It was
then that t'ne spirit of mischief awoke in
the brain of one of the men. "Can't we
ilx them, up properly?" he demanded of
the others. It was the girl who solved
the problem. She produced a box of pow
der from her suit case with the proposi
tion that they should powder the heads
of their fellow passengers. She could not
complain that her idea was regarded with
disfavor. When they had finished their
work the brakeman paused at the door
of the car. "I've seen lots of folks fright
ened with wrecks." he said, "but this is
the first time I ever saw a whole car of
them go white in a night."
It wp.s a strange procession (hat alighted
from the car at the depot. The porter
cherished the tip that had closed his eyes
to the peculiar color of hair of most of
his charges. Men and women with com
paratively youthful countenances and
perfectly white hair followed each other.
Tlie three conspirators were weak from
laughter.
"JuFt think of the fun they will have
trying to get it out." said the girl.
"But only think," said the men, "of the
fun that they will have trying to explain
in their happy little homes how It came
to be there."
"The Available Food Supply." |
*-j-Â«HE American Stock Growers' Association has published its
I proceedings at the recent meeting in Denver, and is entitled to
*â¢ public attention to what it has to. say about our export meat
trade. Last year we exported 600,000 live cattle, 338,000 live sheep
and $160,000,000 of meat products. The association by resolution
committed itself to the policy of protection, but said : "We demand
that the Senate of the United States shall cease obstructing that
equally great principle, reciprocity, which we regard as essential to
extend our foreign markets for agricultural and livestock products."
Dr. Salmon, chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry in the
Agricultural Department, said on this subject, that we are produc
ing a large surplus of meat products. Limitation of the export
trade frequently cause's prices so low that the producer does not
receive fair remuneration. If we could supply the foreign markets
where meat is scarce from the American markets where meat is
cheap, both markets would be benefited. The new German tariff,
which becomes effective in March, 1906, doubles the present duty
on our meats.
In France there is not only high tariff but prohibition of- the
importation of live animals. We must pay the maximum duty, be
cause there' is no treaty giving us the benefit of the most favored
nation treatment. A treaty of this kind was negotiated, but failed
in the Senate. By these means the trade has been so hampered
with restrictions that all branches of it have been injured and some
have been destroyed.
-The tariff" obstructions to meat export arc of comparatively
recent origin, and are obviously retaliatory. The association calls
for a revision of ou*r international tariff regulations, to the end that
the livestock and collateral interests may be fairly treated. From
the discussion of the subject, it is evident that the livestock men
feel that they are being sacrificed in the interest of manufactures. It
is alsp evident that there is a high sense of community of interest
between stock growing and agriculture.
The iesue is quite clearly made out and is indicative of a great
internal pressure of conflict between the two great industries of the
country, agriculture and livestock on one .side, and raw material
and manufactures on the other. To deny the existence of such an
issue is to shut one's eyes to a fact that is made plainer every day.
Germany has made her new tariff in view of this issue. Postponing
its effective operation until next March is calculated to , precipitate
the issue in the coming session of Congress.
That session will have a full docket of practical questions. It
cannot postpone the railroad rate issue, in the measure to' enlarge
the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission. That question:
must be fought out to a finish, and wisdom dictates that it be finished
before the next Congressional elections. The President has de
manded for it the right of way and it will take precedence. When,
it is concluded, the condition of our export trade, as affected by the
new tariffs of continental Europe, takes the field in the House and
Senate. The present prospect is that reciprocity will have as wide
backing as the rate bill, and as extended opposition. In man}'
quarters this high contest will be regarded as involving the fate of
the protective policy.
This may be so only in case reciprocity is again denied. The
resolution of the Stock Growers, passed at Denver, recites that:
"The principle of a tariff for the protection v>f home industries is at
present the fixed policy of our Government, only through the -votes
and influence of the stockmen and farmers of the Central and ' Wes
tern States. We protest against that abuse of this great principle
which is making it an instrument for stifling competition, a shelter
for monopoly, and a cause of hostile tariffs by foreign nations, which
should furnish a market for our surplus."
There is no mistaking the tone of that declaration, and there is
no use in denying the sympathetic attitude to it that is held by a
very large number of people. The only way to treat the subject is
the American.way; discuss it, reach an understanding by perfect
freedom of expression, characterized by tolerance toward opposing
vjews. Out of such discussion will come a great balance sheet, that
will disclose the source of the greatest benefit to the greatest num
ber ,of people.
If this be reciprocity, the principle will temper but not destroy
protection. If it be. protection as it stands, then reciprocity will be
destroyed. The issue is squarely joined and there will be no middle
ground. . â¢ _^
MEAT EXPORT AND RECIPROCITY.
IF the train, from the West had, been
on time there would have been no
occasion to tell- this 'story. If' the
railroad officials had not decided to
run a special for the accommodation of
those passengers who were, \u25a0 waiting in
Western Illinois for the belated train
there is little likelihood that the succeed
ing events would have happened. If there
had not be^en.a wreck on the road'none
of these incidents would have been of
particular consequence. But all this came
about out of the schedule and produced
unlooked for results.
The special train consisted of a baggage
car. a day coach and a chair car. When
the passengers discovered that there was
no diner attached there was woe unlim
ited, for every one" had expected to ' se
cure dinner on board the through train
anl had had. nothing to eat since noon.
It was 6:30 by the time they made the
discovery and the train was not due to
arrive in. Chicago until nearly 11. There
was not even the proverbial "old lady with
the lunch basket aboard. The conductor
added to the general dismalness of his
announcement that they would s^op in
no place long enough to permit even ,a
lunch. The passengers settled .back in
gloomy quiet. .. .
At nearly 8 o'clock the conductor came
to the door of the chair car. "You might
just as well get out here for a" while," he
said with a cheerfulness that must have
been assumed. "There is a work train
wrecked on the track ahead of us and we
can't pull out for three hours."
"Can we get anything to eat here?"
some one asked with anticipatory delight.
'"Might try," was the laconic response.
The porter volunteered, the information
that there was one store in the place.
There was a rapid exodus of all the men
from the chair car. One girl went but on
the platform and besought the porter to
bring, her any eatables that the town
might contain. Five mintues later he re
turned, empty-handed. "A man cornered
all they had to sell," he explained, dole
fully, "and I couldn't get none for you."
"Can't you buy, it from him?" begged
the girf.
"Don't know. Here he is now. I'll ask
him." And. ask him he did.
The owner of the available food supply
of the town was unwilling to sell, but
more than willing to share. He imme
diately tendered the cheese and crackers
to the girl on the platform and suggested
a picnic in the moonlight. Then he went
to the chair car and invited the other
women to attend it. The look that they
bestowed on him was of such indignant
scorn and such regard of the conven
tionalities that he returned with the re
mark. "They all come from. Boston. I
thought that they would get under the
seat and say 'Me-ow* in a minute."
The available food supply was not plen
tiful. But the girl who had gone to the
picnic discovered an acquaintance in the
day coach. He had another acquaintance,
and the three formed a coalition against,
the outside. A candy salesman was divided
from his goods, but was himself shut out
from the trio. It was all managed so well
that not even a tabby cat purred.

A story Is told of a diplomat who rep
resented a South American republic at
Paris. There had been revolutions at
homeâ so many that the financiers there
had no time to send his salary. But he
took this misfortune philosophically, sold
all the furniture of the legation except a
bed. a table and some chairs and occupied
one room with his principal attache, who
was good enough to cook the meals.
Any one who called early on the min
ister would probably find him cleaning
the boots. "What would you?" he would
say, waving an expressive boot. "My

forgotten us again. But when I go back
I shall make a revolution and appoint

AWAITED HIS CHAXCE.
Hi AM convinced," said the Poet, "that
1 a writer of verse should be judged
less by that which he says than by
that which he leaves unsaid."
"That is a queer proposition," the
Practical Man responded.
"No doubt you think so," the Poet
continued, '"because you lack the ana
lytical min-d and have never written
verse, but to one who has" both of. these
qualities the proposition is very clear.
Any man who has written verse knows
how great was the significance of the'
things he did not say. Doubtless, how
ever, I could make this clearer to you
by some concreto illustrations. Shall I
try?" .
7 Well, you might, if you .will sort of
boil them down." .
"T will boil. Here, then. â with apolo
gies to various authors â are some Il
lustrations of what I mean. We will
begin with that beautiful little gem
sung, and occasionally spoken, about
the earth:
"'Oh, do you remember sweet Alice,
Ben Bolt;
Sweet Alice, with hair so brawn.
How she wept with delight if you
gave, her a kiss.
And trembled with fear at your
frown?'
"This is what the poet said, and the
world rejoiced in his song; but here is
what he undoubtedly left unsaid:
"I don't want to Injure your feelings,
Ben Bolt,
But tears that she shed for a kiss
And trembles she trembled because
of your frown,
All proved her an imbecile miss.
"Can you doubt that the poet must
have known that this was the natural
conclusion of his verse; yet he cut it
out, and I honor him for it. Again,
take that real gem â and I mean it â
l>eginning,
"'Oh, loosen the snood of your hair,
Jeanette;
Let me tangle a hand in your hair,
my pet.'
"That is genuinely beautiful, but
suppose that the poet had concluded it:
"For I'm longing to know, though it
seems so ideal,
Whether the hair that you're wear
_ ing is real.
> "Is it not evident that the poet must
have known that some such termina
tion as this was entirely possible? Yet
he concealed' the fact, and. we should
honor him for it. Again, by way of il
lustration, let us take a popular idyl:
" 'Mary had a little lamb.
Its lleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.'
"You should recognize that the poet
intentionally leaves an element of mys
tery and charm at this point, and the
most heedless reader involuntarily in
quires of himself, 'Why did the little
chump follow Mary?' Now suppose
that the writer, of that charming idyl
had at once proceeded to explain, as
follows:
"The reason for this startling freak
Of course is very plain:
The lamb tagged Mary thus because
She had it on a chain.
"Do you not perceive that this immortal
poem would have been damaged ir
revocably by such a termination? Yet
no one can reasonably doubt that the
writer must have recognized that such
a termination was possible, and she de
serves great credit for not springing
it on the public. Ah yes. I always shall
contend that a Doet should be judged
not so much by what he writes as by
what he leaves unwritten. Don't you
think I am right?"
"You appear to have made out con
sideiuble of a case," the Practical Man
replied.
A GOOD FELLOW.
IHAVK heard it remarked. William,
that you are a "good fellow," and of
course I am delighted. That is, it
may be delight that is permeating my
system at the present time because of
the fact, but I am not exactly certain
of it. Your welfare would give me
pleasure, butâ It is a large "but."
William. You see, I have known quite
a number of 'good fellows" in my day,
and a pretty fair sprinkling of them at
the present time are reposing in various
penitentiaries. This is not because they
absolutely preferred a penitentiary aa
a place of residence, but they concluded
that they would go there, anyway. I
might mention a few names of such
"good fellows," and some of them wpuld
not be unknown to you, but it Is better
to let the poor devils be forgotten.
So, you will understand. William
why I am not exactly "tickled to death"
when I hear that you are a "good fel
low." It may be all right, but â I have
explained about that "but."
Ah, it was ever so long ago
Come to me, little one, come to me here
And I'll tell of. a land that I used to
know,
The beautiful land of a far away year.
There the birds sang sweeter than now
they sing,
And the skies were bluer, a marvelous
blue, . .

And the hours were bright as your eyes
but, O, '
: It was ever and ever so long ago!
There in the land that I knew so well
! Listen, my little one, for it is true
Wag a shady nook in a blossoming dell
That only myself and the fairies knew.
There I have heard/their laughter shrill,
Or have caught the gleam of a vanish
ing hand,
And they were my servants to do mv
will, ' \u25a0"
For I was a king in that lar away land,
And the wee folk heeded my wish, I
trow,
Ever and ever so long ago.
You have heard of Jack who the giants
. . ,. . slew . .
Closer, my little one, closer to meâ
Well, he was a friend of my own, I knew,
In that far away land where the elfins
be.
And often I shuddered to hear him review
How he killed the ogre that night so
drear, v
And I vowed that I also would kill a
. few â -. ~
Ah me! I haven't slain many, I fear
But still did the giants stalk to and fro,
Ever and ever so long ago.
I am weary to-day for that far away
landââ '

Among the passengers from' Honolulu
were three men well known in the ship
ping world. Robert Lewers of Honolulu,
Captain William Matson of the Matson
Navigation Company of this city, and
Stanley Dollar of the Dollar Steamship
Company all came from the island port
on the Siberia. %\u25a0
Passengers on the Siberia from China
say the Chinese are in earnest about their
boycott on American goods and will
maintain the barrier until Uncle . Sam
opens the door to the United States
wide enough for Oriental merchants and
students to pass through as easily as the
educated classes of other lands.
The other members of the party were:
Dr. K. Moultanowsky, who was the
Orel's chief surgeon; Dr. A. Polozoff,
also attached to the Orel, and B. Belet
skl, who was the agent at Port Arthur
for the Rueslan Red Crocs Society.
Dr. Paris, a French surgeon on the
Orel, jvho passed through here some time
ago, raid that the Japanese violated the
treaty of Geneva when they fired on and
captured the Orel. Surgeon Moultan
owsky says that the Japanese took the
Orel because they wanted the ship.
In the kind treatment accorded them
after their capture the five Russians who
arrived here yesterday have forgotten all
their bitterness against the Japanese,
and as far as they are concerned the
little brown man is an enemy now only
ia a constructive sense.
The Japanese are taking good care of
their prisoners. Evidence of this was
brought to port yesterday by the liner
Siberia, among whose passengers were
five of the Czar's subjects, all recently
released prisoners of war. They looked
well fed and healthy and appeared iff be
In high spirits. They had nothing but
kind words for the enemy, on the fat of
whose land they have been living ever
since the fortunes of war placed them in
the brown men's keeping. When Nicholas
sees his subjects and hears the tale of
their pleasant sojourn in Japan, he may
feel some regret that he, too, has not
been able to take the rest cure under the
Mikado's protecting wing-.
Two of the Russians are women of high
birth and gentle rearing. One of 1 them.
Miss Olga Pavlowsky, is a niece of Ad
miral Rojestvensky's. She was taken
prisoner early in the naval fight, the fin
ish of which saw as much of her uncle's
fleet as had not run away converted into
'scrap iron, and her uncle himself badly
wounded and in the hands of the enemy.
Miss Olga Tour, the other woman in the
party of homeward-bound prisoners of
war. was a doctor in Russia, and, with
Miss Pavlowsky and many other well
born Russian women, volunteered to ac
company the Baltic fleet to the Orient In
the capacity of hospital nurse. Miss
Pavlowsky and Miss Tour were assigned
for duty on board the hospital ship Orel,
the story of whose capture, at the be
ginning of the naval fight, has already
been told.

When the case of Bert Campbell,
charged with grand larceny, came on for
trial before a Jury' in Judge Cook's court
yesterday it developed that the transcript
oj the-testimony taken at the preliminary
hearing before Police Judge Conlan had
been stolen from the District Attorney's
cf;ice. A search was made for another
trg.nscr.ipt in- the branch office of the
Comity Clerk, but it could not be found
and the presumption is that It also has
br-en stolen.
The fact that both transcripts, which
ttsere tha only ones in existence, have
been stolen leads to the conclusion that
erme one interested In Hie defense is to
Mame. There was no opportunity of al
lowing the witnesses to refresh their
memory, and it placed Assistant District
Attorney Porter Ashe at a great disad
vantage in examining them in view of
the fact that the alleged crime was com
mitted on' June 13. 1903. An investigation
\u25a0will be made with the onject of ascertain
ing who has been tampering with public
documents.
Campbell Is one of the defendants in
co-nnection with the alleged footrace
swindle in Golden Gate Park on June 13,
1903, the victim, to the amount of $2500,
having been Herman Grunnauer. 1740 El
lis street. The other defendants are
Charles C. Lee, John S. Moore. C. A.
Houston and Ira P. Wjlkerson. They are
waiting tria.l. D. E. Fletcher, another
\u2666iofendant, was tried and acquitted by a
Jury on October 1, i 903. Grunnauer was
induced to wager his Â£500 on Fletcher.
Lee, who represented ! himself as a bu
colic stranger, was supposed to wager an
Â«qual amount upon Campbell. "VVilkerson
vac the stakeholder, and It Is alleged
that Instead of putting up an equal
asiour.t with Grunnauer he was in on the
swindle. Campbell won the race.
The witnesses examined yestehrday
were Grunnauer and E. J. Burns, a bar
tender, who was the referee. The case
\u25a0will go on again this morning.
Before the impaneling of the jury was
commenced Attorney Frank J. Murphy
for the defense Insisted that he had a
right to have the jury box full before be
ing compelled to exercise his challenges.
He based his position upon a recent de
cision from the District Court of Appeal
cf the -Southern District
Tfce Judge said the Supreme Court of
the State had decided otherwise In the
case- of the People against Scoggins,
which had been followed in this State
tor twenty-five years. He had very great
r<-?pect for the Judges of the Court of
Appeal of the Southern District, but he
agreed with Judge Hart of Sacramento
in' overruling their decision and following
the decision of the Supreme Court-

The sessions of the second annual
convention of the California State
Nurses' Association ended yesterday
afternoon and tho- social side of the
yearly meeting" was obsorved by a ban
quet ut the St. Francis Hotel last
night. To-day the :iurses will be leav
ing- for their homes or gathering In
small parties to discuss the events of
the convention just ended. : From start
to finish the. sessions were well at
tended and the v/ork of officers and
delegates calls forth the highest praise.
Yesterday's morning session was
taken up In the performing of an in
structive operation in the amphitheater
of the Lane Hospital. Nurses of the
association and students of the Lane
Hospital crowded the benches to watch
Dr. Wallace Irving Terry amputate a
man's leg. The patient was afflicted
with tuberculosis of the knee. Miss
M. Florence Holsclaw. a nurse of su
perior ability, superintended the oper
ating roo-.n and assisted Dr. Terry.
The operation occupied the entire
morning.
After noon hour the nurses gathered
in the lecture room of the Cooper Medi
cal College to witness practical de
monstrations of treatment of patients
and manipulation of surgical instru
ments and bunduges. The principal'de
i monstrators were nurses from the sev
eral training schools in. San Francisco
I and Oakland. On the small stage in
the center' of tho lecture room were
beds and bathing appliances, while In
a semicircle rose tier after tier of seats
filled with graduate nurses and proba
tioners. Here and there among the
audience sat solitary men, for the de
monstrations were open to the public.
The first demonstration was the Nau
heim medicated bath by Miss Hostetter,
who gave an exceptionally clear ac
count of the method of treatment. Af
ter the patient had been tucked in one
of the cots Dr. F. W. B. Waketteld dis
cussed the virtues and faults of the
various fever and clinical charts sub
mitted by the various hospitals.
The nurses then beheld a practical
demonstration of placing a fractured
foot in plaster cast with application of
a modified Buck's extension and manip
ulation of plaster of paris. The nurses
performing the operation came from
the Children's Hospital. A sweat bath
was then given the patient by the
nurses of the Fablola Hospital.
Hypodermic injection of saline solu
tion by Mrs. Bay Thomas and bed
making by Miss Olive Smith, both of
the Clara Barton Hospital, proved in
teresting. The afternoon session closed
with a demonstration of the prepara
tion of catgut and tropa cocaine by
nurses of the French Hospital.
Last night at the St. Francis only
nurses of the association and a few
favored guests from the East sat down
to a delightful repast in the banquet
room. During the course of the even
ing many speeches were made tolling
of the work of ; the organization and
the benefits of the convention. Miss '
S. Gotea Dozier, recently elected presi
dent of the association, acted us toast
mistress. . . :

was given Shields to-day and he pitched
good ball. Walters' catch of a line

out at the plate twice, once trying to
steal home and another time trying, to
score from first on. a line shot to right
by Frick. Brashear hit the ball hard

NEW YORK, Aug. 2.â The third day's
racing attracted a good sized crowd. The
Splna way. Stake waa the feature of the
card. TherÂ© was a lot of fouling and
Jostling in this race, also other Incidents.
In the first place. Last Cherry was with
drawn after she had thrown her rider
half a dozen times while being brought
on the track from the paddock.
At the request of her trainer, she was
withdrawn. Clay Woodford's stable, Run
ning Water and Single Shot, were the
choices and there was no question that
Running Water was the best of the lot,
but she was shut off by Curiosity at the
homo turn, and lost half a dozen lengths.
This gave Edna Jackson a decided lead
which she held to the end, beating Run
ning Water by two lengths. Curiosity
was disqualified and Cousin Eva placed
third. 'Summary:

The main event of the contest was
the absence of Baby McLean from the
lineup. The baby forgot to show at
a recent game at Portland, when he
received a hot tip at the track. The
directors decided to assess him fifty,
but he thought they were kidding him.
Yesterday, however, when the pay en
velopes were handed out Mac was shy
the- coin and he felt so sore that he
decided not to get into action.
Deacon Van Buren was called off
first base and placed behind the bat.
Van- Is' not used to grabbing foul tips
and things, yet he caught a very cred
itable game and winged a couple of
Oaks out at second. However. Mc-
Lean's absence hurt the Giants and
possibly cost them a victory.
Oakland 6tarted right In during the
first lnnir.g and made two runs, though
they .s.bould have made a dozen. Van
Hsl'tren was safe on Runkle's wide
heave to first and Francks tore off a
hit. Van Buren let the next one get
through him and Van Haltren came
home. Dunjeavy beat out a hit and
Kelly singled, chasing In Francks.
The next two men died easily, so only
t\vt> runs resulted..
The Giants managed to annex one
in the third- by means of Van Buren's
double and" Runkle's single, Oakland
sent two more through in the sixth,
Kruger starting off with a two
cu6hlor.er to left and coming through
when Kelly, singled to center. Kel
.made second' on the throw In and
Brick Devereaux responded with a
drive past third that netted the final
run for the day. The score:

; were totaled at the conclusion of the
I mile race which wound up the meet, It
j was found that the local man had cap
, tured the coveted honors by almost fifty
, points.
Parry, the young giant from the "Windy
City, had a big lead over all his oppo
l ner.ts before the start of the mile event,
I and he was looked upon as a sure winner,
I for all that was necessary for him to
I make good was to finish within a lap of
| the leaders, but he fell from exhaustion.

! the points he would have acquired had he
i breasted the tape in last place.
I The victor won only two events, the
I broad jump and the 130-yard hurdle, but

I gave him a big score.

Rufe Turner, who Is to meet Jimmy
Gardner at Colma on Friday night, fln
lahed up his work In the gymnasium at
Stockton yesterday and is now In good
trim for the battle of his life. He has
been working hard for more than three
â¢weeks and has proved himself a glutton
In that line, as he keepa right at It every
minute of the time that he Is going
through his paces.
_ Turner will do nothing to-day but some
road work In the forenoon. He has been
boxing every day recently with "Kid"
Williams, Bob Langley and his brother,
Charley Turner, tho old time middle
weight. If there had been many more
days of work some other talent would
havo had to be brought in, aa Rufe has
worked so strenuously that every one
was out of the game with tho exception
of Charley, who still shows signs of his
once great form.
There was auite a orowd out to see
him go through his paces yesterday after
noon and he looks to be perfect in every
respect. There does not seem to be an
ounce of superfluous flesh about him and
at the same time he does not BÂ©em to be
one bit drawn. He can never have any
excuse to make on the grounds of poor
condition If he fails to .bring home the
money the Stockton sports figure he is
sure to get.
Turner realizes that this is the chance
of his life and he is as full of confidence
as any fighter may be. After he had
finished his work in the gymnasium he
boxed three rounds with his older brother
Qharley and wrestled the same length ot
time with Bo.b Langley. When he had
been stripped, bathed and rubbed down
he stepped on the scales and weighed
Just 131 V* pounds.
The Stockton sports will leave in full
force on a special train at 3:45 o'clock on
the afternoon of the battle, and, t while
they"' have been hoping to get some odds
In the betting, they will have plenty of
money to bet at whatever the prevailing
price may be, and if Turner loses hard
times are expected here for some time to
come.
Jimmy Gardner's great left hand has
won him a number of admirers among
the local sporting fraternity. The Low
ell lightweight has used it to great ad
vantage on hi? sparring partners at
Larkspur and many think he will be
able to wear Turner down with It be
fore the fight goes many rounds. Gard
ner is about ready to enter the, ring
now. He had a little trouble in taking
off weight, owing to the cold weather,
but hard work finally overcame this ob
stacle and now that his training is
about ended he appears to be about
right. \u25a0>-

; Old Sores are tlja resnlt of * deeply
'polluted, foul blood supply. -.Tho blood
is fjlle.d with poisons, and as it finds an
outlet through the ulcer, the surround-
ing parts become diseased and the soro
eats deeper into the tissues and flesh, and
becomes a permanent trouble.
' 'Some years aro while at work, I fell
over a truck and severely Injured both
of my shins. Sly blood became poisoned
as a result, and th* doctor told me I
. 'would have running' sores for life, and
that if they â¢were closed up the result
\u25a0would fee fatal. Under this diEOouragr-
ingTeport I left off their treatment and
resorted to the use of S. S. S. Its effects
were prompt and gratifTing. it took
only a short whila for the medicine to
entirely cuxe.up the sores, and I am not
dead as the doctors intimated. I would
be, neither have the sores ever broken
out again, and some twelve years have
elapsed since what I have described 00-
curred. Having been so signally bene-
fited by" its use I can heartily recom-
mend it as the one great blood purifier.

. Salves, powders, plasters, etc., do no
good, and the sufferer gets disgusted and
often despairs of curing an old sore. The
trouble is in the blood and until the poison^
ous matter that is keeping up the ulcer is
driven out the place cannot heal. S. S. S.
.reaches these old sores through c the blood
by removing every particle of poison or
impurity from the circulation and build-
ing tip the system. It makes the blood
' . ,v ' healthy so that
1 ( ened and the
PURELY .VEGETABLE, sore can heal
'\u25a0<\u25a0 \u25a0Â«. â¢ naturally and
permanently. If -yon., have aa old sore
t>t ulcer do not waste time with salves,
; powders, plasters, etc.," but write for our
c book and ask for any medical advice you
wish. We make no charge for either.

Gustav Scherf, driver St a pound
wagon, who was convicted of murder
in the first degree by a jury in Judge
Lawlor's court and given imprisonment
for life, was formally sentenced by the
Judgre yesterday morning, San Quentin
being designated as the place of con
finement. While in the dock Scherf
was laughing and joking with other
prisoners and deputy sheriffs. His face
clouded while sentence was being pro
nounced, but immediately after he was
all smiles again.
Scherf shot and killed Rudolph W.
Schultze In front of his residence on
Fifth avenue South on August 24 while
Schultze was trying to save his daugh
ter's pet dog from the pound net. The
murder raised a storm of indigna
tion throughout the community at the
time. It was the general belief that
Scherf would suffer the death penalty,
but the jury saved him from the gal
lows. It was thought, out of sympathy
for his aged mother, who sat beside
him during the~trial.

The Pacific. Mail Company's liner Si
beria, Captain. J. Tremaine Smith, ar
rivrd early yesterday- morning from the
â¢Orient* five and a half days from
Honolulu and two days ahead of her
schedule time". She r>rought 159 cabin
passengers, seventy-six of- them from
Honohiju. She brought thirty-seven in
\u25a0th-e. steerage, -and 2SI Asiatics. She
brought 57^1 tons of cargo, which in
cJnded 27,<97 packages of tea, 57SS bags

tiTk is .valued at about $300,000.
On" July 21, In latitude 31.51 north,
longitude 162.47 east, six days before
the.-Siberia reached Honolulu, the liner
niet the Manchuria carrying the Taft
p.arty 10 the Oriont. The vessels passed
' so. close together that it was almost
possible to distinguish faces, and a
noisy demonstration was made on both
vessels as the big liners passed and ex
. changed salutes.- After leaving Hono
lulu the Siberia met and exchanged
rijrnals with the Korea and the Ala
meda. Fine weather was encountered
thrwughoiit the voyage.
The Siberia brought to port probably
the most contented crowd of passen
\u25a0gers that ever crossed the Pacific on a
IVicifie Mail liner. There was no
crowding Â»n staterooms or dining sa
loon Â«md the weather was perfect. As
the Coptic occupied the Siberia's berth
the' Silver ia did not duck .until after the
Coptic's departure. Th>Â» Siberia's pas- i
tengcrs-were transferred in the stream
to tha tvs Arabs and as the tender left
tiie liner's side the passengers sang '
"For He's a. Jolly Good Fellow" in
honor of Captain Smith, who stood on
ihe gangway waving good-by to the
people he brought safely across the
ocÂ«an. At the end of th% refrain the
passengers, among whom were many
pretty girls, gave throe cheers for the
tki; per and Uie girls cheered as loudly
&s the men. For the Siberia's smart
appearance credit is given to Arthur
O'Neill, the liner's executive officer and
oae of the most exacting housekeepers
in the service.

General Manager Calvin of the'
Southern Pacific Company has ordered
an examination of - the men employed
in every branch of the operating de
partment of the big railroad system.
The practice of subjecting employes to
a thorough physical examination at
regular intervals has been in force on
the large Eastern roads for a number
of years, where the results, it is claim
ed. Have tended to materially improve
the service. The coming examination
on the Southern Pacific system will be
the first undertaken on the Western
Harriman lines, and will begin In about
ten weeks under the direction of Chief
Surgeon Ainsworth.
Every man who has anything to do
with the handling of trains will have
to submit to the Inspection, which will
include a thorough test of the sight,
especially as to color sense, hearing
and the general physical condition. To
facilitate the examination special cars,
in charge of assistant surgeons on the
various divisions, will be sent over the
lines, stopping wherever convenience
suggests.
It is proposed to renew these exam
inations every three years and a care
ful record of every employe's condition
will be kept in the offices of the North
ern and Southern districts. When a
man enters the employ of the South
ern Pacific Company he has to undergo
an examination, but this will have no
particular bearing on the future exam
inations. The announcement has been
made that the surgical car, which the
Southern Pacific Company has had in
process of construction for a number
of months, will soon be turned out of
the shops. It will be used to attend
wrecks and other disasters that may
occur along the lines of the company.
The car is supposed to be one of the
best equipped In this country.

Importers and dealers In hats filled
the private office of United States Ap-.
praiser John T. Dare yesterday morn
ing to give testimony before I. F-
Fisher. president of the United States
Board of General Appraisers,. In tha \u25a0
matter of certain protests made to the
cellection of duties on Mexican som
breros as trimmed hats. ,^
The duty on untriramed straw bats Is 33
cents, while that on trimmed hats Is
fifty cents. Walter Anderson, H. Gold
smith and others testified that the
leather binding on the edge of the.
brim of the Mexican hat was not^ con
sidered a trimming, but that sweat
bands and cloth or leather bands
around the crown would be considered
as trimmings.
Stanley Jackson appeared as counsel
for the importers In the matter. The
issue involved amounts to many thou
sands of dollars In value./ The case
was declared closed and taken under
advisement. At half-past 10 o'clock
this morning the protest of S. Levy
& Co. against the payment of du
ties on wool skins as well will be
taken up. It has been already ruled
that If the wool on a sheepskin is less
than a quarter of an inch in length no
duty will be levied, but if longer than
a quarter of an inch duty is to be col
lected. The matter is to be determined
upon the question of fact.

eral Appraisers Opens

CHICAGO. Aug. 2.â The firm undertone \a>
the wheat market developed late In tiie *i 6
sion. At the opening sentiment was AnclfnoH
tr, bearishness. With the exception/ of i
epasmodlc advance in the first teW Jhnlutea
the market was under, selling pre^Wire until
noon. Initial quotations on SeDteftiber were
a shade to U@U' lower at 84*4Â©84% a
brisk demand from commission houses ranâ¢
a sudden â¢ spurt ' to 84%@55. = Prices, however
slumped off again as quickly as they had
ripen. The cause of the brisk upturn was a
prediction of rain to-night in Minnesota. Pit
traders, however, were in general influenced
by a decline in the price of wheat at Liver
pool. The weakness of foreign markets it
was claimed, was due to more hopeful p'roÃ
pects for an average crop â¢ of wheat in Rus
sia. Another Influence that had a denre^sine
effect on the market was the improved tone
of dispatches from the Northwest telling of
the condition of | spring sown crops: although
damage reports were received, a large num
ber of advices -claimed, that the crop was In
good condition. For . September the lowest
point of the day was reached at 83%. During
the final hour of trading, sentiment became
quite bullish and the market rallied to nearly
the top prices of the day. News from the
Southwest..- was more favorable to â¢â¢ the bull*
Receipts to-day at Kansas City and St. Louis
were smaller than for the corresponding day

j-lf The Lumber Market.
Pacific CoÂ«st Wood and Iron says:
'Th.-. cc-rr.and in July was irood to strong and >
r.oTnal. Th. year 1905 has been better than j
last yea? had the ma.nu Â£a cturers and ir.er- j
chants feel far more eatisfied than they did j
â¢.we've TOcr.thh po. Prices are well maintained |
;n all fields and there wenis to be no indica- ;
tion present of any falJing away in current j
All the wood* are active, since '.
. building operations are lively all over the j
coast and pos^itily are most pronounced in '
Southern California. Steamer a:ter steamer, .
intcrir-persed with sailing craft, are traveling
down the coast with all kinds of lumber car- )
cT':e. and "the merchants or the south are. .ike \u25a0
, Oliver Twist, crying for more. They are >?et- ;
ting "ill the lamber products that are possible. !
but btiir their tnaw remains unfilled.
. "Shinglec are moving actively end prices \
at& well maintained, with an. upward tendency .
for redwood, which is possibly so. to a lesser :
extent, with the red cÂ«-ciir. This is true both .
for local. ani Kastern business, and the manu- ;
fai*turÂ»-rs oi both species look forward to a |
general betterment of business."
Deits&nd for Low-Priced Stock*.
The New York circular of Henry Clews 1
feays:
;*>"P<H:ulation appears to be converging to a :
noticeable degree upon the lower-priced stocks, j
This seejx^ cuite reasonable in view of the !
'"high prices which the high grade investment ;
-â¢^unties have attained and which are co well
yt\<\ that they have materially narrowed thÂ« !
f.' hting supply of securities on the market. J
!:i view of this a feelinjc of optimism seems
to be increafcing in regard to the lower grades j
of Ftolks, and hag for its basis the tenerally i
favorable technical situation and the diÂ«x>- ;
Pition of the large financial interests to take 1
h. favorable view of future earnings, as e-vi- ;
cenc*4 by the recent.- increases in dividend I
cittributions and the placing of Erie -Eecond J
rrererrtd. :or Sne:anee # on a 4 per cent basis. :
iT''.<j ' dividend action in regard to Erie had 1
"A .te h. stimulatir.K â¢effect on general senti
fr.-ru and was sided by the continued favorable
'.u:ation in the great iron and steel industry
ah rejected by th<Â» active demand for steel i
rÂ«-;!s ar.3 structural materials. The activity :
ir.d cor>!ider.c* noted last week in this direc- |
lien continue uninterrupted except that manu- j
fa'-turers are showing more conservatism in j
lix-lr ; urchasee of pig iron and are evidently !
d< >-rrr.:r:ed not to permit business prospects '
to tx> rr.arred by ill-considered speculation. ;
The cuancriy statement of the United States '
i^itel Corr'crjition was regarded as a fairly '
:a\o:-i:fc'.e one, but did r.ot reflect the Increased I
activity that has developed since the begin
ning cf July."

Coadition of Steel and Copper Corpora
tions.
The New Tork circular of J. S. Bache &. Co.
cays:
'\u25a0Â£arnings of the Kteel Corporation for the
June CCÂ» Quarter amount to $3Â»,305,116, aa in
- crc-aee .cÂ£ $10,814,*i5Jl compared with a year
ago. While not the largest net earnings on
reo-.rd. tiey approach so nearly to tbe highest
fig-jre* &b 10 1* batisractory beyond question.
The corj/crauo-i is steadily strengthening its
position, it is developing the foreign field
and win probably soon have a subsidiary in'
Canada. It is the supply of raw materials
tha* will tell in the loec run. and each year
that passes makes more vaiuabie the com-
X*ny's eaonnous holdings of coal and ltae
ttone and its 700.000.00u tons of iron ore. The
. t*"Â«rease<l -charges for betterment*, extensions
<nf 4 depreciation, amounting to '$7,900,000 for
Quarter jufct ended, add largely to the
value of the corr.paxy'B securities.
â¢'Exx->rts cf copper continue heavy, and the
Ftea/iitess of prices at around the 15 cent
mark haÂ« been one of tie features of the
business situation for over a year. Stocks
of copper on hand are at a minimum,
a.r.d the borne deciand is large and increasing.
Tiie' copper nsarket Is a. natural one. and the
tend^r.cy is distinctly upward. Many of the
conpani** are- earning large amounts on their
sharf-y bX present selling- prices. The Amal
gajritted ConiDaay is In a much better posi
tion than it was when cepper was selling at
' !T rer.tÂ» and the company paying 8 per cent
tf!vidÂ»nds. Its ore bod!Â»Â»s are being tested at
the lower levels and found satisfactory, the
rpek at tTae smelt ere Is proving richer than
for some time part, and the .company is say-
Uig lsrte amounts by tbe settlement of the
unfiergrouad war Jar* with Helnxe. It is c*r
tairi that this latter factor will result in a
perrranenl lowering of tbe coet of. production
of r per Irom thft Butte Mountain. There is
room for legitimate improvement- in the price
of the eopiXT shares, ar.4 with a continuance
of prosperity it ts eura to come. Not only fs
thif trup of cofpers and steels, but of many
ctber â¢ iqadlr.g iafiustrial shares. Attention
tcfcicli haa tnÂ«re- or lees been absorbM in the
rs-tlroads will in time include theÂ« Issues, and
In a bull market aiacjr of them will sell at
much hither figures.
â¢â¢Tbe situation is essentially sound, and

Hay and Feedstuffs.
Feedstuffs are . quoted as before, but Bran
and Middlings are reported easy. The receipts
of Hay were very much smaller yesterday, but
the market was still overstocked. The citcular
of Somers & Co. says :
'"Shipments .of Hay during the past week
havo been running very heavy, the total. being
practically the. same as that cf last week â
5600 tons. The tracks and Hay wharf are
blocked with Hay and the situation is in a
very bad shape.. Large quantities of Hay have
been sold, but as there are not sufficient Hay
teams in San Francisco to remove the Hay -as
fast as it is arriving it naturally accumulates
on the market,- thus creating a very bad state
of affairs. All regular handlers" of Hay are.
being so crowded w" 1 - shipments that they are j
unable to buy from the commission men, ao
that there are many cars on the market for
which 1 there is practically no sale. We have
experienced similar conditions' before, al
though we fear that with the unusual heavy
crop this season that matters may continue
this way for some little tlnÂ»e to come.
"We can report no change In the outlook, i
for most everything arriving is placed In San '
Francisco,, but little being exported. There
Is notMng now in sight to encourage us in j
anticipating any foreign .or coastwise move- .
ment of our surplus stocks.
"Even the choicer grades of Hay are feeling
the weakness occasioned by heavy shipments,
while poorer grades , are dragging at even
lower quotations."

Potatoes, Onions .and Vegetables.
There was some little shipping activity .In
Potatoes, the low prices having attracted some
business from the Southwest, but there was not
sufficient movement in that direction to re
lieve the market, which was still badly con
gested with river Burbanks. Onions continued
weak, supplies being too large for the local
market to absorb, and there was no inquiry
from outside points.
Prices o' miscellaneous vegetables showed
but little variation, supplies of most descrip
tions still being far in excess of market needs.
Peas and Beans were still scarce and firm
and Corn was steady for top quality offerings.
Tomatoes were still in burdensome supply and
Cuournbers were a glut on the market.

Poultry and Ganie.
Arrivals of domestic Poultry were compara
tively light and the market cleaned up better
than for some while back, there being morÂ«
snap to trade. Prices, however, showed no
Improvement, as there was no actual scarcity
of anything. A car of Western Hens was

Butter. Cheese and Kkc.h.
The Butter market showed some irregularity
yesterday, some houses quoting a firmer mar
ket, while others found the situation weak and
unchanged.- It. was largely a question of
stocks, which were unevenly distributed, some
houses being oversupplied and others not hav
ing sufficient. Receipts were lighter than of
late up to the middle \u25a0of the day. '
Cheese stood the same, choice mild new
being firm and the lower grades neglected and
weak. â¢
Most houses reported an easier feeling in
Esv. as the recent advance is affecting the
retail demand and also leading to more or less
withdrawal from cold ; storage. Prices, how
ever, remain unchanged.
Receipts were 43,900 lbs Butter. 1126 cases

, ' Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
There were heavy arrivals of fruit in bulk,
chiefly Peaches and Pears, and. as the canners
were operating cautiously, the market for that
line of goods was easy and there was ,a
heavy surplus at the close. Buying on canning
account is likely to continue quiet for some
time,/ as all of the leading- concerns are over
loaded with contract supplies of Bartlett Pears
Apricots- rule firm, as the season is practically
ended and there is very little stock coming in.
Wrapped Bartlett Pears of good quality were
firm in the open market, while Peaches were
easy owing to the heavy accumulation of
bulk fruit which was offering to the regular
trade at low prices. Small packages of Prunes,
Nectarines and Plums were plentiful. and weak,
except for fine German Prunes in crates. Mel
ons were in better demand, but the receipts
were too large to admit of any improvement
in cricee. Retailers manifested but little in
terest in Grapes and weak prices ruled for all
varieties. Crab Apples were eagerly sought
after and available : supplies cleaned -up
promptly at good prices}. 40-lb boxes bringing
$1 50 and small packages 75c. Other Apples
showed no Improvement, supplies being far in
excess of the demand. The market was badly
congested with Blackberries and the outside
quotation was obtained only for fancy Santa
Clara lots, $2 per chest being the top for
offerings from other sections. Strawberries
were firmer and Raspberries ruled steady at
the old quotations. Mexican Limes were higher,
stocks being closely cleaned up, while all
other Citrus goods were steady but quiet.

Dried Fruit, Nuts, Raisins and Honey.
'.- \u25a0 The East continues to "report firm markets
for all Fruits, as will be seen by the following
from the . New â¢ York Journal of Commerce :
"'"Currants' were ; held steadily 'up to quota
tions and .buyers who t asked for - reductions
were emphatically refused. . Uncleaned in | bar
rels were 'quoted up to 5%c. with nothing, of
fered below 4%c. Prunes continued to attract
some attention and . prices ; were . held firm iat
3Uc for Santa Claras, four sizes," in bags f. o.b.
For SCsrand 90s 3%c was asked and no one
could' be found who would -offer anything' at
lower prices. Crop . conditions were reported
no better and a total yield of 70,000.000 pounds
appears >to, be the - outside estimate. . . Apricots
were ; firm ras quoted y with , the â¢ situation un-<
changed > as : regards ' condition and output. For
standards up to Sc is \u25a0 asked *on thÂ« spot. , Fu-'
tures range up to s%c.as to grade. Peaches
wÂ«ro ; ouiet" with scarcely ; any interest noted
a year ago." The 'market closed" firm.'' with
September at 84%ig54%.
Small receipts- notwithstanding the com
paratively high prices bid for the grain in the
country was the source of a remarkable ; de
cree of strength displayed in the corn mar
ket. The clote was strong with prices at the
highest point of the day.'- September opened
%ii 1! i to '/.@vÂ«iÂ»c higher at 52% to 52*4 c. sold
n\. to 03?4 and closed at the best figure.
Reports of an excellent export demand had a
strengthening effect on the oats market. ThÂ«
market closed almost at the highest point of
the day. September closlnz at 28c. \u25a0
Provisions were largely firm in sympathy
with a 5c to 10c advance in the price of live
hogs. September pork closed 2Â»Â«>c up at $13 00.

net Joseph Rousse, a cook, seventeen
years of age, and asked Rousse to join

and went to Sausalito, where Wilson
made a bet in a poolroom and won
some money. They returned to the city
and had supper. After supper, they
visited several saloons in the "red light

Rousse led Wilson to his home.
When Wilson awoke on Tuesday
jnoming he discovered that $215 ln
goid which be had rolled up in the
sleeve of his undershirt was missing
and he notified the police. Detective
Riordan was detailed on the case and
late that night he met Rousse coming
out of the Chutes and arrested him on
a charge of grand larceny. When
searched he had $45 60 In his pockets.
He admitted taking the gold from Wil

Michael Regan, with white teeth
gleaming between a scrubby black
mustache and a blue chin, averred that
he tramped from Point Bonita to the
nearest point of steamship communica
tion with San Francisco, the sole ob
ject of his pilgrimage being to pur
chase for himself a bridegroom's sar
torial outfit, he being engaged to lead
to the hymeneal altar the beautiful
daughter of an affluent land-owner. He
had advanced so far as to buy and don
a pair of blue overalls when a police
man arrested him as a vagrant.
"The wedding has announced
for this evening, your Honor," said Mr.
Regan to Judge Fritz, "and If I am not
released at once it will .be Impossible
for me to fulfill my contract.'' Â». ,â¢
When the Judge, who has roamed
the hills and vales of Marin \u25a0"- County
The prosecuting policemen did not
establish a very, strong case against the
girl. They had seen her ln company
with one George Grlggs, who had been
convicted of passing fictitious checks,
and they had seen her several times
when she was unaccompanied -by any
one. That was the substance of their
complaint.
Then the Judge, after deploring the
frequency with which Jury trials are
demanded, took the case in his own
hands and questioned the girl as to her
past life and future plans. Her par
ents, she said, dwell on a farm near
Stockton, and she desired to return to
them and would do so if she were dis
missed.
"I think it is the best thing you can
do," said his Honor, "and I'll give you
opportunity to do It. Certainly your
moral welfare would not be promoted
by sending you to Jail."
So she was dismissed, and the Jurors
shook hands with the Judge and told
him they approved his action.
"I did not Intend to deprive you gen
tlemen- of your prerogative to convict
or acquit," was the response, "but I do
not like to see .men taken away from
their business to sit as jurors in case 3
which can more expeditiously and
with equal justice be disposed of by a
magistrate, who"is*paid for his work.
There was no reason on earth why a
jury should have been demanded in the
c^ise of that girl."
Nineteen-year-old Ida Woods,' ar-
Vested for vagrancy, demanded a Jury
trial, and twelve citizens were accord
ingly impaneled by Judge Fritz to hear
the testimony and decide her guilt or
innocence.
"Did yez ever see de likes of dat?" was
his response, addressed to the Judge.
"W'y any., of dese guys, an' a dozen
mere, can tell you dat she hit me so
hard dat I fought a mule kicked me."
When the court records proved that
Mrs. Seymour was chronically truculent
his Honor's incredulity vanished and he
sentenced her to six months' Imprison
ment. With undisturbed equanimity she
bowed acknowledgment.
"His eyes were so threatening," sweet
ly whispered Mrs. Seymour to the bench,
"that 1 felt sure he was preparing to
strike me. so I involuntarily thrust my
hand forward to protect myself from the
blow." The smile she bestowed upon her
accuser was sadly reproachful.
To the would-be mesmerist's intense
surprise and physical agony, he received
from the lady's fist a blow ln the abdo
men that sent him soaring.
*'I shoved him away," murmured Mrs.
Seymour to the Judge, "because he
stared at roe Impudently."
"Shove nothin'!" exclaimed the assailed
one. "She gave me a ehortarm jolt wld
her right, youh Honor, an' lifted me
free feet ln de air. Me han's wuz dpwn

pected dat I had no time to block it. It

They had testified in detail that while

theater entrance whiffing cigarettes and
interchanging conjecture as to what the

a Youth who steals coix
This brought up the contention which
has not been decided in court, whether a
man is a resident of a precinct when he
is an Inmate of a hospital in that pre
cinct. McQuaid said that upon that ques
tion a large number of patients would
claim a right to vote and that there was
no way to stop them without trial of a
test case ln court, which would be im
possible so late in the campaign.
"I de-pend upon my own judgment In
tlfls thing," said McQuaid. "and will see
that every man registered from this ln
sTTtution votes, notwithstanding your ob
jections. I do not want to be an accom
plice to false registration, but will place
my, judgment against Bylngton's or any
one else. I defy the Grand Jury to flnd
a single charge upon which they can stop
the methods in vogue here."
"What objection have you to us ques
tioning at least one of the inmates of this
hospital?" Harris asked.
"My obstinacy is all and sufficient to
prevent that, and I'll be d If you
meddle around here any more."
"Do you understand that your actions
In this matter make the suspicions of the
Grand Jury look well founded? Perhaps
a witness besides yourself would increase
the value of your testimony," Harris
spoke up.
"Do your worst," wers his last words.
"I don't care what you or the Grand
Jury think of- the way this affair was
conducted, and all that I can say Is, "Go
to itâ fight me." Â»
As a farewell taunt McQuaid asked An
drews if he knew Dick Welch. The jibe
was evidently an attempt of the superin
tendent's to give the Impression that he
thought Andrews was Induced to â¢ make
the hospital Investigation ln the Interests
of Welch. However, he was disappointed.
for the Grand Jury foreman disclaimed
all knowledge of the man referred to.
The relations of the men were strained
when the leavetaking took place by the
parting remark of McQuaid that he knew
the visitors wanted to kick up trouble,
but they could get ho answers from him.
The Grand Jury willmeet at 2 p. m.
to-day and receive the report of Fore
man Andrews. Subpenas will be issued
for some of the inmates of the City
and County Hospital and they will be
questioned as to whether any of the
registration was illegal.

After Chiaza had shot himself Mrs.

He went into the dairy and saw Chiaza

This morning he wanted to marry me,
and he often asked me before to do
the same thing, and I kind of encour
aged him and promised to marry him
in about two years. After he asked
me to marry him he went out of the
store and was gone about one hour. I
advised him to go away for a year, as
I did not want to see him about the
place, as the neighbors might talk. He
said, 'I will not go away; I want to
see you every day.' We were in the
back kitchen f s.t the time. We then
went Into the back room next to the
kitchen. He asked me to consider my
answer. I said 'no.' We were then
about six feet apart, and he pulled a
pistol out of his clothes and -fired two
shots at me. but did not strike me.
The bullets went into the wall. He
then turned the pistol on himself in
the neck. He fell down and never
spoke afterward. I never had a pistol
myself in my life and do not know
how to use one. My sister, Mrs. Hed

was the first to arrive on the scene
after the shots were fired."
Charles Chiaza, a young Italian la

two shots at her out of a revolver yes
terday, then sent a bullet into his own
neck. He died in the ambulance in

Superintendent McQunfd of the City
and County Hospital defied Foreman
Andrews of the Grand Jury and Auist
nnt District Attorney Hurri* yesterday
and refused them permission to exam
ine patients In the hospital. as to tliqlr
alleged illcKnl registration, j McQnald
swore at and threatened the officials,
declaring that he would throw them
out If they attempted to investigate too
thoroughly. He boastfully asserted
tiint he was not to be trilled with and
that there was no cause for an exami
nation. When told that his attitude
toward, the Inquisitors strengthened
their suspicions, he told them to go
ahead and <lÂ« their worst. Xcver be
fore In the history of the Grand Jury
has such determined opposition to in
vestigation been, encountered.
After the inquisitors had listened to
McQuald's trlade on reformers and the
Grand Jury Foreman Andrews told- him
that the* affair was not ended by far
and that, once started, the investiga
tion would keep on until the right of
the patients to vote is determined.
The climax of the meeting was when
McQuaid dared the Grand Jury to find
anything crooked with his methods in
the registration, and then in one of. his
irate moments exclaimed. "Abe Ruef is
my friend and I am proud of it."
Superintendent McQuaid said last
night that he would get a doctor's cer
tificate to show that any Inmates were
patients if the Grand Jury attempts te
subpena them. He said that everything
done yesterday was a bluff to keep the
Investigators busy until the election is
over. He announced that if, the Grand
Jury attempts to enter the hospital to
day he will- have the gates closed upon
them.
He repeatedly told Andrews that the
present Grand Jury is looking for trouble
and could get its "fill" from him. Throw
ing out his chtst he shouted loudjy that
he had been in politics in San Francisco
since a boy and knew every trick and
turn in the game.
McQuaid made, a travesty of the ex
amination by refusing permission to the
Grand Jury foreman to see even one of the
inmates, and he threatened to throw the
investigators out of the building if they
attempted to question a patient. He an
swered such questions as he saw fit and
wandered off the subject to score some
of his many enemies in the political field.
If. McQuaid had had his way there
would have been no stenographer present
to record his vituperations and write out
the various threats which he made
against the "meddling" Grand Jury. He
objected strenuously to the presence of
Mrs. Collins in the room and said that
he would refuse to answer the questions
put to him If they were to be written
down: but later he forgot his objections
and talked freely.
When Foreman Andrews, . Attorney
Harris, Stenographer Mrs. Collins and
the bailiff appeared in the office of Super
intendent McQuaiA L .hey were greeted by
that official with a cold smile. He was
not aware 'that an Investigation was to
be held. Mr. Andrews talked about the
management of the institution for some
time before getting down to business.
The list of the voters connected with the
hospital was produced and points were
talked about in a general way, but when
direct questions were put to McQuaid he
stopped talking.
SHOWS 'HIS TEETH.
"Is it- true that some of these voters
have no right to be registered from this
precinct?" was asked, and the stenog
rapher got her pad and pencil in readi
ness. McQuaid grew perturbed and said
that he would not talk while a stenog
rapher was present. f
"You take my word for it," exclaimed
McQuaid, "there are 14S voters regis
tered from this hospital, but only 102
of them are entitled^ to vote. But they
will vote, and no law will stop them be
cause technically they are in the right.
I have been in this business long enough
to know when registration is being con
ducted properly, and my four years' ex
perience in the Registrar's office gave
me enough knowledge of the law not to
implicate myself In a false registration
case. Ever since the so-called 'dirty gang
of grafters' took possession of the City
Hall the* patients in this hospital have
voted, but since I came into control here
there has been no crooked work on the
premises." â¢ â¢ â¢
| "There have been accusations that the
! registration from this hospital was not
straisht, and I am here to investigate,"
declared Foreman Andrews, "and we
do not propose to take your or any other
person's word that this work is legal. We
must flnd it officially."
"There is a cleaner hospital adminis
tration now than ever before," said Mc-
Quaid hotly, "and I have been in San
Francisco since my birth and know this
political- game from the ground. I do not
intend that you shall take any other
man's word for the conditions here but
my own, and that will have to suffice. If
you want the names and occupations go
to the Registrar's office and you will find
them, there. I will not permit any liber
ties to be taken in this building by you
and your party, and I will not tolerate
any report that I myself do not furnish."
REGISTRAR STANDS IM.
Foreman Andrews had gone to the Reg
istrar's office before visiting the hospital,
but the occupations of the voters were not
made out for his inspection. When told or
this McQuaid was much aggrieved at the
foreman and became irritated to a great
degree. .
"The inmates of this Institution voted
before' my term as superintendent, but
not since," he said, "and they
will not be permitted to vote il
legally 'while I am in office. But I
would like to' see a great roaring battle
between us, lots- of "gore spread around
and some more of this unpleasant news
paper notoriety. I will win In spite of
you. When the fight starts next Tues
day my sympathy is with the other
crowd (Ruef's), and then you will know
where I have bee,n."
j Andrews asked if the men without the

"We will have a way to overcome that

A careful ; examination .'. of the - list of

and McQuaid was questioned by" Attorney
Harris as to : each one's residence '.. and
business ln connection with the hospital.
He was told In many cases that. the men

Joe Lescalzl's team of horses and
\u25a0wagon were slowly proceeding along:
a rail track on Mission street when a
car came up behind and the motorneor
thereof vigorously rang for right of
way.
"I won't leave' this track," shouted
Joe over one of his shoulders, "until
you have heard from my own lips what
I think of you and the darned corpora
tion that employs you."
So from Tenth street to Sixth street,
while his team maintained its snail
pace, Joe vociferously berated the
United Railroads and the bellrlnger
behind him, and only ceased his vitup
eration when a policeman took him
into custody. Judge Fritz pronounced
him guilty of peace disturbance.

After some heated argument Albert
Bertanl and Theodore Caldron doffed
their coats and vests and resorted to
flgticuffs as a more expeditious means
of settling the disputed question. Their
combat quickly attracted a throng to
Broadway and Taylor street, where It
was waged, and when Mr. Bertanl
scored the first clean knockdown by
visiting his right hand upon the left
jaw of his opponent, the latter called
: to his friends in the crowd to aid him,
whereupon about a dozen stalwarts ad
vanced with threatening mien toward
Mr. Bertani, who discreetly retreated
and Indiscreetly left his coat and vest,
the latter containing his golden watch
and chain, J in the enemy's camp. The
garments disappeared, of course.
"I will continue this case one week,"
said Judge Fritz to Mr. Caldron, "and
it would be well for you to see that
the missing property is restored to its
owner before you reappear here."..
To look at Mrs. Jennie Seymour was to
question the veracity of witnesses
who testified that she displayed acerbity
of temper, herculean strength and pro
nounced fistic science last Tuesday even
ing upon the sidewalk fronting a Market
street home of melodrama. She was
middle-aged, seemingly fragile of phy
sique, and her facial expression was
Madonna-like in its gentleness.

â¢ Janes E. Fitzpatrick, clubman, butcher,
tplner and cracksman, was convicted by
a jury in Jud^e Cook's court yesterday
on the charge of burglary for robbing the
telephone box in the office of Herman
Albert. coaJ dealer, 1765 Waller street, on
October 4. The Jury wm out only a few
xiiinutes. having taken only one ballot.
\u25a0\Vhea the verdict was read the- defendant
looked, bewildered for a minute and sat
staring at the jury, rubbing his forefinger
against his chin. Then he pulled him
self together and talked with his counsel.
The -defendant's young wife sat beside
him while Assistant District Attorney
/.she made the closing argument to the
Jury *nfl the Judge gave his Instructions.
Just as the jury filed out of the court
room to consider the verdict she cried:
"Take me out; take me out." She stood
up and fell Into the arms of her sister in
a dead faint. She was tenderly carried
to the branch office of the County Clerk,
where she was placed on a couch. Dr.
TTllson Mizner chanced to be present and
he attended her. Several women friends
reraairiod beside her, but it was nearly
t.wo hours before she was able to leave
the Hall of Justice.
One of the defendants friends ap
proached Attorney Twamley ln the cor
ridor. He was shaking with passion. It
looked for a minute as if he intended to
strike Twamley. but instead he said: "I
would rather go and shovel dirt on the
Streets than prosecute an innocent man,
as you have done."
Twamley paid no attention to him
and walked away.
Fitzpatrick was ordered to appear for
sentence next Tuesday. As soon as he
left the courtroom he was taken before
Police Judge Conlan for his preliminary
examination on another charge of burg
lary for entering the office of A. Devoto
& Co., 2M7 California street, on June 24, :
and stealing <14* from the safe. At the |
request of his counsel a continuance was ;

Jail, and his wife did not see him.
