THE SECRET OF LYNX ISLAND.
The first impression of the capital of
Quelparte will be the most lasting im
pression, however* Ions may be the
stranger's stay. He may learn the
great wide avenues, the little twisting
streets, the palaces old and new, the
great gates of the city wall, and even
the mountains round aboutâ but to the
city he will be a stranger still. The
spirit of that valley, caught up slowly
in centuries of time, is never really felt
by the temporary sojourner; at least,
after a busy month 'with Oranoff here
I felt when I gazed out from-the plaza
of the Russian Legation over that sea
of roofs that I was no less a perfect
stranger tban when I first saw Kein
ning. It was nothing that Dulcine Oran
off and I had folowed that great city
wall ten miles in circumference, or that
from the highest peaks of the "Silk
Worm's Head" we had looked for hours
iipon this old relic' of. other "centuries.
Our happy companionship was real
aye, fast deepening; the mellow au
tumn lights aslant, -the. blue mountain
sides were " realâ these', intangible
things could be seen and felt; : but old
Keinning lay deep in. a .revery, not a
syllable of 'which could be caught and
held. Its white people were ghosts,
and all their, beliefs and traditions
were 'ghoulish mysteries. \'
. Such was . the . general setting of the
piece! As for s its development, even the
sober Oranoff seemed satisfied; each
act, carefully planned,' went, through
swered rme:"But it will be* red, Mar
tyn, before a single month has passed.
The Czar has a razor for every beard;
men talk of the power of Russlan'.ar
mies, but they are* nothing to the secret
service men.'who are fast realizing -Pe
ter's dream. The-heavler the beard the
sharper the razorâ and the rule works
botb-^rays, even while Czars come and
go. That dream is still president." :.
There was. fire" in the words and the
man unconsciously, raised a hand as he
spoke'thern as though swearing aholy
oath. 1 was ihrllle^. v
How that" old dream does i live on!â
aye, and will live while most, dreams
are dead Lnd' forgotten. Peter left the
Eastern Continent to Russia. If* this
was not the first'^ it was the greatest
will ever broken. By some cruel
mockery of faie Russia has. come -Into
the possession of the gfeate'st but least
desirable portion of its. inheritance,' the
deserts of Asia and Siberia; but Europe
and Iiidiai Persia and China/Tare, .for
some reason, ;stlll Unconquered. My
thoughts ran back to Quelparte. .; \ i
"There is a razor, then,* for the King
of Quelparte?"
"For this reason,", said Oranoff, com
ing close to me; "we are about to lease
Port Arthur- from China; that will
make Japan /wild. I am to go and con
quer Quelparte with gold rublesâ the
King and his. nobles; when that is
done" â '-: the man v. threw his ; hands
apart quickly and. looked aty me. .
"Throw Quelparte over, as a sop 'to
Japan to avert war andâ " jV;
'-,". "And keep -Port, Arthur," "said Oran
qff, sinking Into his chair, -evidently
.satisfied" with me. _Â¦ , ' " ' ' . ' { ,.
The>wind was rising and as the
prow. of-.vour. ship,.,' pounded Into, the
trough of. the Bea.^the 7 great f red and
whl^emaD floated- lazily out fromjts
anchorage on the wall;^ ?. Â¦ : '-- ";^.7
. ."It Js growing rougher/.' said Colonel
Oranoff at last, rising to tishten'an'in
candescent. globe on his table. I--.won
dered that he^ could , T so .quickly come
back to the present. : ._ ! \" ;'.:
"Then if , you ) f ail,"- 1 Â¦; ventured,
thoughts still ' running (fast i : to .the' end
of the" chapter, "little, is losC' since \ the
conquest of Quelparte is only, to be i a
temporary triumph." v
"Fail!" he repeated In, a gentle., tone.
".Those razors' are,. not sharpened' on
failures," and â¢ Oranoff looked at -. me
smiling. He had the patience of a true
teacher! Â¦Â¦.-Â¦', . Â¦- : : . v
A.little nettled at myself, ; I lÂ»y gaz
ing upon that blood-red, map. and soon
the color made' me think of war, and I
found myself talking again to that*si
lent man. : '." â â¢ â¢ Â¦" / , r â¢'
.^"You cannot fear a, war with Japan,
Colonel Oranoff?". ,
, "Peace Is purer," he answered quietly.
Then looking ait. the map he continued:
"We have gained much more by peace
jthan by warâ more than Caesar or
Alexander or. Napoleon ever gained in
war," and . the" tired voice seemed to
strengthen ori*the.*bbast. ' "
" 'Peace hathits victories,'." I quoted
.with solemn triteness. , . .' /
'-'But they cost- too," ., Interrupted
Oranoff , "cost more than those of war;
our 'wars cost the. Czar 1 the lives of
thousands* of his , lowliestâ peace the
lives of hundreds of his best; war takes
"muscleâ peace,* brains. Does the Czar
gain- or lose?". / i -, ;
"He gains '.the i dream,", l\ suggested,
and the tired man sighed* "Amen."
The night's conference ended with the
storyof Menin. I had risen to take my
leave when Oranoff drew, me to the ta
ble and displayed a photograph of him
self he had taken, thoughtfully from the
recesses of a cabinet drawer.; .
"You spoke of â¢"failure," he said, and
then tossed-thls picture angrily on the
tableX .'Â¦Â¦ Â¦'Â¦ V; : -. '. . ' .

/"The hell hound can't help tha,t," he
whispered fiercely.' â¢

CHAPTER III.
A LESSON EASILY LEARNED.
, Two. weeks after I parted from the
Oranoff's at Yokohama my little steam
er" trcught me to Tsi, the seaport of
Quelparte. ' ;Â¦;â¢ 7 , :
I was rescued '"- from the coolie-in
fe3ted wharves by 'a gruff old Captain
Dejneff, who came-down from the capi
tal with Miss Oranoff to .meet me. Soon
we were off for Keinning, twenty miles
inland, i^w^j
_\; A';- clear, sweet day of the matchless
month of November lay upon the Land
of Morning Calm. Such is the native
name, preserved by. courtesy,, of a land
which lias known only centuries of op
pression by China or Japan since long
before the birth of J Christ. But the
mornings have remained true' to the
nameâ in inverse ratio to history's:de
ilance of It. The battle-ground of Utie
nations each ! side ;of ; it, the : wanton
spoil of conquerors fronVali isides, Quel
parte, has been"/ the; ''dark 'and .bloody
ground"- of -Asia,- and 'has,, the^
fate"- and "doom ,pf fa*; nation Â»so'plainly

let you come to your own, decision alone
at sea. Make it and cable me from
Yokohama. You have knocked around
the East enough to fit you for such
business; this with your West Point
training makes you the very man Oran
off needs."
For what business I had been fitted
by following, two years before, a run
away Celectial army, might well be con
sidered a Chinese puzzle, yet such had
been my chief experience in the East.
During the Japan-China war I had
been an aide to an American army offi
cer. Colonel French, detailed to study
the Chinese campaign, and we had fol
lowed the Yellow Dragon throughout
the Inglorious retreat , from Korea to
Peking; from Wun Lung we got back to
Tu Loo and Tu Lung, and if there had
been more Loos and Lungs between
that and the palpitating heart of the
thing, Peking. I doubt not we would
have gone then? too. But the Russian
Bear, in his humorous but favorite role
of White-winged Dove of Peace,
stepped In and put a stop to the war
through fear Japan would keep what he
wantedâ Port Arthur, the Gibraltar of
the East. After that, Colonel French
and I could have given points to a
stampeding herd of cattle â but what
else were we good for? â¢
This, with a lazy journey through
Europe, homeward, made up the sum
of my experience in the golden East.
Yet I had acquired a thing of which I
did not know; it was the travel fever.
Have you had that fever? If not, you
have escaped the most pitiless disease;
one knows not when he contracts it
and it never leaves. Other fevers burn
themselves out, or snuff out'the patient
and die down with the life light. " This
fever never dies; It fills the sufferer's
eyes with arhing dreams of quaint har
bors almost, but not quite, reached:
his ears ring with a new coolie chorus
but clearly heard: it fills his nostrils
with the me.dley scent cf flower fetes
more beautiful than any he ever saw; it
rages In his brain ;\vith luring" sugges
tions of odd shadows on unfamiliar
hillside?; he hears new voices laughing
beneath new. trees, weird temple bells
tinkling tn the night; and, now and
again, he sees- the battered prove of a
ship come 'longside out of an unknown
sea. Qther fevers freeze : at death's
touch â but does the travel fever? Some
say yes, seme no, and many are silent
here.
"The note inclosed," the letter went
on, "states in my name that you will
meet Colonel Oranoff in the captain^s
cabin the midnight following its receipt.
Send It, and go to-night, lad.. Cable
me your resignation, and we will send
another man to Tokio."
The sea was calm at eventide and the
moon shone bright. After the dancing
Dulcine and 1 found our chairs and
looked out happily upon the glistening
wastes. If we were quiet now it was
because the waves were .quiet â the
baffling winds had left us all to peace.
We had prettily made our mutual con
fessions, the burden of mine being that
I was no sailor and could hot have read
a steamer letter, though it cc-ntained a
will leaving me the steamship line for
an inheritance.
The lights danced high In Dulcine
Oranoff's large black eyes while we
hinted of the days ahead. I was sur
prised to find how fully this girl shared
her serious father's confidences. She
soon told me that their destination was
Keinning, the old capital of Quelparte.
"We are to settle Japan's snd China's
ancient quarrel for its possession," I
volunteered, looking at my watch.
"Yes," Dulcine answered me slowly.
"In favor of neither?"
"In favor of neither," the girl replied
as we arose.
When, a few minutes later, I was ad
mitted to the captain's cabin. Colonel
Oranoff welcomed me with genuine
warmth to his great table cpvered with
a mass of papers and maps. For a
time he spoke of my father, and I soon
caught the drift of his reminiscences,
in .which he implied a great trust and
confidence in me for my father's sake.
He could not have done. this in a more
charming indirect way, and it won me
to him even more than anything my
father had written. For a time then
he remained silent, resting his pale face
on his hands, gazlifg down upon the lit
tered tabje.
A large' map, oddly marked In red and
white, hung on the wall near me and at
once attracted my attention". The man
at the table came to me at last,, his
<?yes also upon this map. '
"You are looking at Peter's map?"
he asked. Then, without awaiting a re
ply, he continued, stroking it with the
end of a pencil as he spoke. "Peter
the Great made a will and bequeathed
to Russia this eastern half of the world.
The red," and here the pencil swept
swiftly from St. Petersburg^to Korea,
"shows the portion of our inheritance
Â¦we have received; the white we have
not yet obtained.". .
"The will has been contested," I com
mented, dryly enough. '
"And is still in litigation," Oranoff
answered suggestively. I was looking
beyond Korea to Quelparte. ' V
"Quelparte is still white," I said. The
man looked at me one moment and un
derstood. "You have not danced all the
evening." he commented with a pleas
ant nod. Then he turned quickly to the
map and his face grew stern as he an-

CHAPTER I
SEALED ORDERS
I stared over the railing upon the
changing face of the sea; the long
sweep of the hungry billows, the blue
black troughs between them, the de
ceptive, curlinp: crests plunging one af
tpr another like thundering columns of
plumed cavalry driven at the freak of
the winfis. matched perfectly the inco
herent turmoil of my thoughts.
.Miss Oranoff's chair was close to
mine, but a great gulf separated us.
such as will come sometimes between
friends when mutual explanations are
long. overdue; and the silence of that
g-ulf lay heavy upon us after my first
words of hot resentment, which made a
pale girl paler still and an angry man
not less angry.
What Dulcine Oranoff and I had been
to each other matters little to the re
cord of what we became; but it mat
tered very much to me that she had
left Washington without one hint or
word of farewell, as though I were no
more to her than a legation lackey. I
had at K-ast been 'more than that.
And now, while pacing the deck be
fore reading the strange letter my
father had bade me not to open until I
Mas on the sea, I found her, to whom I
half feared it related, smothered in
rugrs in a steamer-chair near the cap
tain's cabin â a passenger on my own
good ship Gaelic to China!
I would not speak, and ehe, it seemed,
could not, and as we sat like pouting
children in dogged silence my thick
thoughts stumbled on from one impos
sible explanation to another more im
possible, and it was not until I
thought again of my father's strange
letter that I saw any light. One mysr
tery sometimes unravels another, as
one poison is an antidote to another,
and it occurred to me that that letter
rr.'.ght explain this other mystery,
Â¦which was so like slow poison to me.
But as I rose to go I found a gentle
man behind us, and Dulcine sat up
quickly at sight of him.
"Father." she said slowly, "may I
present Mr. Robert Martyn?" Then. In
a moment she continued, not without a
catch in the words which belied their
formality,: "Robert, my father â Colonel
Oranoff." The swift glance, the low
tone, the halting words, coupled with
my knowledge that the name Oranoff
Mas not on the steamer's passenger
list, made it plain that the two were
traveling incognito.
Colonel Ivan Oranoff had married a
"Washington lady and maintained a
home in Washington, though he was
detailed abroad almost constantly in
the Russian diplomatic service. His
name was well known In many lands,
and the man was said to be known
even where his name was not!
The commonplaces of introduction
were cuickly over and Miss Oranoff
hastened my departure by lightly scor
ing me for not having read my steamer
letters.
Not one word about steamer letters
hod passed between us!
"Read those from home first," she
called after me, despite a quick, low
â¢word from her father. The command,
with Its distinct challenge, made me
surer than before of the secret within
0. secret which that one envelope would
explain.
CHAPTER II
A DREAM THAT LIVES.
Whenever I look back to those hours
In which I determined to enter the em
ploy of Colonel Oranoff of the Russian
service, my father's lifelong friend, I
remember best my light-hearted care
lessness â and I am sobered. How. much
youth owes to Ignorance; Its buoyancy.
It* indomitable 'hopefulness, its reck
less self-confidence, were, each and all,
impossible but fÂ«r that monstrous
debt.
"I have never urged you. Robert," the
letter ran. " to interest yourself In this
came wp play, but it is the one grand
pame of the world. Where else are the
stakes so greatâ the gains and losses so
momentous? This offer oZ dranofTs
Kivcs you a splendid chance to 'take a
hr.nd,' if you care to. I deterninel to
' "They do everything backward, here,"
she was^already laughing; out- to me;
"the boys braid their hair down their
backs and the men do it up on" their
heads; the fires are" built under the
floors and the chimneys open into the
gutters; is that a new adaptation of
ycrur Russian stoves, Captain Dejneff?"
This gruff old officer, whose face was
buried under a great sandy beard, took
not unkindly to Miss Or'anoff's running
fire of bantering quips. Yet my little
experience among men made me look
twice at him; he had an odd predilec
tion for bumming old songs, and "he
locked 'at the plains as though they had
told him some of their strange secrets.
Dejneff- had been connected with the
Russian Legation here for many years;
he was somewhat forgotting the outside
worldâ being slowly "embalmed alive in
the traditions and superstitions of "this
strange land.
This Dulcine was discovering," with
out comprehending its real intent.
"See," she cried to me, as we were
passing " a , little cluster * of 'Â¦,straw
thatched huts In a sequestered vale,
"the only children In the world who do
not play on a doorstep!" . '
We had suddenly flushed a covey of
little people, who ran helter-skelter into
the nearest hilts and peeped out at us
from the dark interiors.
'.'Do you also fear the devil of the
threslloJd, 1 Captain Dejneff?"
1 The low-hummed song was choked as
the great square shoulders came up in
a shrug.
"Oh, I don't know," he replied* "why
not? If there Is oneâ peste!â it's better
to look out, I think. not- the Ro
mans carry brides over them?" A peo
ple of ten millions and not one, who
dares to stand or sit on the threshold
for fear of the devil there! As I recalled
the superstition in the light cf Dejneff's
attitude I thought of the draughts in a
doorway ( . Were they the devil?
A : flock of wild geese flew suddenly
up from a pa4dy-fleld and went way
wardly circling in the thin blue air
toward the dfstant mountains.
"There goes my Widowed Wild Goose,
Captain Dejneff," cried Dulcine; >'give
me the melody, and Lieutenant Martyn
shall see I have not wasted ray time in
Keinning."
The old man hummed a little louder,
but as Dulcine caught the measure he
stopped quickly and- listened y to the
girl's clear notes in the Quelpartien love
song: -Â¦ Â¦' /, .>'_'"â¢'.'/ > \ ' "
; Silvery moon and frosty air, .
-. Eve and dawn are meeting:
Â¦Widowed wild goose flying there.
Hear my words of greeting!
On . your /journey should yqu see
'Â¦ Him I love eo broken-hearted.
Kindly Â«ay this word for me.
That 'tis death when we are parted.
Flapping off the -wild goose clambers.
Says she .will If she remembers.
Farewell's a fire that burns one's heart.
And tears .are rains that Quench in -jiart.
But then the winds blow in one's sighs.
And cause the -flames again to rise.' â¢Â¦
My soul .I've mixed up with the wine.'
' And now my love is dr Jnking â
Into his. orifices nine
Deep, down its spirit's sinking. ,
To keep him. true to me and mine, -â¢
A potent mixture is the wine! ,
Fill the ink-atone. ' bring the water.
To my love I'll write a letter;
Ink and paper soon will eee
Â»The one that's all the world to me.
While the pen and I together.
Left behind, condole each other.
The sky and plains made a perfect
setting for the song, so Â¦ sad and yet
throbbing with human experience.
One must be impressed with the
weird songs of the East, bearing so
lightly and everlastingly their heavy
loads of care^ But does '.this burden
differ from the burden of our own pop
ular music? I recalled the street songs
of America prevalent, at the time.* What
a load of sorrow, regret, hopeless con
trition, this mongrel music voices! Are
the world's songs all sad, 'and are our
Christian hymns of hope and trust and
faith our only happy music?
â Old Dejneff was interesting Dulcine
Tn the women of this poor land, some of
whom we metâ veiled, unveiled, smiling
in the chairs in which they were carried
by hurrying coolies, or weeping under
weary loads.
Up to the age of 10 or 12 the little
Quelpartienne of good family. enjoys
great freedom, and can play in the yard
with her brothers and ' see whom she
wishes, but the time comes when she
must never be seen without the chahg
o-t, or sleeved apron over her head and
held close about the face. From that
time she remains mostly within doors
and can be familiarly seen only by the
people of the household and the nearer
relatives. This- stage of her life Is
short, for. she generally marries young
and goes to take her place in the family
of her husband, who will be found liv
ing with his parents. From. that time
on she can be seen and conversed with
face to face only by her husband, fath
er, father-in-law, uncle, cousin, second
cousin, etc., down to what the Quel
partiens call the "eight point," ;which
means the relationship ; existing be
tween two great-great-grandsons of a
man through different branches. This
means something like fourth or fifth
cousins in America. It will at once ap
pear that a Quelpartienne is ..not en
tirely cut off from social intercourse
with men," for in a country where fami
lies are bo Jarge as in Quelparte the men
on both" sides of a family within the
limits v prescribed â¢ may number any
where from twenty to a couple of hun
dreds. Of ;- course, grandfathers and
great-grandfathers and ~ great-uncles
are also among the fovored ones, al
though their number is naturally lim
ited. But as a rule none of these male
I relative's will enter the inner part of a
ho'useV or .woman's '. quarters, except on
the invitation of .the husband, and gen
.erally in his, presence.
To all this, and much more, Dulcine
listened with rapt Interest, though in
terrupting her grave companion often
'with merry peals, of. laughter. , What
particularly interested me "was 'the
amused interest this DejnefC took in the
strange customs of the : people, while at
the' same time he turned Jout to be
signally superstitious regarding their
superstitions.? Oth?r ' things .being
equal (If -they ever are), a superstition
is a thing-one man believes that an
other does not.\ Yet there was a . philo
sophy^ in Dejneff's orientalism' that Im
pressed me. : He sought 1 deeply for rea
sons, in: all their â¢fanaticisms. For;in
stance, as he and I were discussing, the
Japan-China- war, over.; our lunch at a
little Japanese inn at' Oricle, Dulcine
swamped our sober efforts at the men
tion of the battle of Pingyang.
"The city of Pingyang. Robert, is
said to be situated in a boat,; and no in
habitant dares to dig a well within the
city wall for fear of scuttling -the
boat!" Â¦/'" u
. We looked to Dejneff. who^sald
thoughtfully, "And they brings water
half a mile, I do think." %>> . *
"Cursing the boat all the way. no
doubt,' I commented. -,', : ; .'
"You believe the legend, of' course.
Captain Dejneff?" The square'should
ers came up, and the growl was deeper
in meaning, even, than in tone: '
"It's not the only vile city on a boat
named Cholera and they are scuttled
by the thousands who do not drink wa
ter brought from without." "
And was this reckless philosophy? In
civilized communities are we not com
ing to know that our great cities are
on boats, and are not millions lost each
twelvemonth who do not drink water
brought from afar?
Â¦ But It was at the house of the ti
ger woman that Dulcine lost all hope of
shaking old Dejneff's sober conceptions
of these foolish myths. This was once
a little hut beside the worn path to
Keinning, now it is only a great heap of
stones. '71^
. It is a Quelpartien belief that If an
animal drinks water which has stood
for twenty years in a human skull it
will change roto a human being. The
story goes that a youth once loved a
maid whose parents dwelt in this
buried hut But while betrothed to her,
which means more in some countries
than in others, he became enamored of
another maiden In Keinning and a wed
ding with her was set. With brazen
face the youth came one day to give
Erlane, a last traitor's kiss. Her pa
rents were overjoyed at the return of
the forgetful lover, but the girl sat
trembling on. her matâ for a crane by
the river had told her alL When the
lad took Erlane In his arms, her hands
held him tight and, still more tightly,
her sweet form- changed, contour be
neath his caresses, her clothing fell
from her. while to cover her blushes, a
tawny, mottled fur closed^ over her face
âand a tigress sucked the <- faithless
lover's life blood and left him dead.
We went on in silence (after each of
the coolies had cast his stpne upon the

had uttered fierce words as they hurled
their stones, and this brought out Dul

"What do the coolies $ry when they

Nearer and nearer drew v the ragged

Keinning. Our day bade fair to end a
little soberly, and I wondered if it was
not all a. stern lesson Dejrieff had been
sent to teach me earlyâ a Reason he
seemed to have learned well in all these
years. My thoughts ran pa to the game
that was playing between those moun
tain crests. Was the Kins of Quel
parte being shaved easily? Or, was his
beard of tougher fiber, than had been
anticipated?, Whatever, the beard, I
knew the "razor" was keen!'
Yet old Dejneff took , occasion to
strengthen his gloomy triumph over our
Incredulity. A great hillside on the
outskirts of the city was covered with
little mounds of earth. The sentinels
stationed there were paid by the rela
tives of the dead; for, Dejneff told" me.
it was a myth 'of Quelparte that if a
grave was harmed all relatives of the
desecrated corpse , became Insane.
"Rifling graves becomes a new way to
pay off old scores," he said at the close,
suggestively.
"But does the legend come true?" I
asked.
. "Often," he answered quickly.
"When the sacrilege becomes known
they think they are going- crazy, so
they go; and It's all the same to ma
what makes them, I think."
I know of no city, which the average
globe-trotter visits, more alive with the
tales of dead centuries than this gray
old Keinning, which most ignores As
we went swaying through the great
gate of the wall the grinning clay mon
keys on the roof, placed there to keep
the devils out, made no cry.
. Dejneff 's chair was near mine as we
went through.
"Dejneff," I asked quietly, that Dul
cine might not hear, "do you who live
here really believe the old legends of
this land?"
- The low, weird monotone he was
humming ceased and he turned stolidly
upon me:
"No, Martyn, we don't; but you fol
low our line and you won't get off far;
we act as though we did."

sternly In the face than during those
hourc. But the best-planned battle in
history was lost by him who planned it,
and won by these who had no plan. V;,:
The fears of a possible encounter with
the agents of the Chinese Tuen were of
a nature to sober the most dauntless,
and the more I pondered upon that
phase of the situation, the more inter
ested I became. The Queen of. Quel
parte had been murdered by Prince
Tuen's agents, on the well-founded
suspicion that she was playing Quel
parte into the hands of the Japanese,
who, after the Japan-China war, came
to have, as all. the world knows, the
upper hand In Quelpartien affairs. ' If,
on mere suspicion of Japanese ascend
ency in Quelparte, Prince Tuen had
caused the murder of the Queen, there
could be little doubt that, upon learn
ing of Russian predominance, he would
make a bolder stroke at Wong-Su and
his dynasty.
And if the secret of the temple*' on
Lynx Island had been discovered, what
could be easier than the seizure of the
sarcophagus ; to those who had run a
hundred guards, entered a palace,' and
murdered a trebly-guarded Queen.
I could have endure^ with better, rel
ish the idea of a contest for the body of
the Queen with' Europeans., But China
men ! I ' would . rather fight : Indians ''or
Burmese, though they, too, ' like \ the
Chinaman, have an absurd way. ot rea- ,

or do the thing, you were' prepared to'

expedients,, as Inconsistent : as 'illogical. 1
' When I try to recair those- days I 'find
I have -only the 1 dirrimesti recollections
of Quelparte. \ Of . this singular; Journey
over those mountains I rerriember.little
more j than my; fears. But there were
great brown : hills which we climbed by
"Butfwhat of the dynasty?" I hurried
on, heedlessly now, for my chance had
come. '"Who can "say how long it will
last? Surrounding nations are rivals/ in
the fighf for the land, and all the^while
the devil Tuen is plotting to overthrow
Whang-Su arid to wreck his throne."
I held my breath when I said the
words. The man was riding at my
horse's flanks and I could not see him.
I dared not look back.
"Prince Tuen!" he muttered hoarse
ly. That was all he said, but the tone
made me shudder.
"So the Chinese Prince is Yon Li's
enemy, too," I mused, as we went for
ward in silence. But now I did not
know â¢ whether Li was of
him in connection with our present bus
iness. I resolved not to give up, how
ever, and was about to renew the sub
ject, when the colonel, abruptly left me
and dropped back to the Quelpartiens,
who were lagging behind as usual. In
less than half an hour a cry came from
them," and as I trotted back I saw that
a trooper had fallen from his horse and
lay insensibFe on the stony road.' As I
came" up, Colonel" Li detailed two men
to stay with the Injured man, and we
pressed: on. Then 1 1 ' saw, for the first
time, that Li's'face was that of a dead
man's. *I started at the sight of It. My
spurs^pierced my horse,' and I was car
ried forward. to my Cossacks at a rat
tling pace. â¢/ i
So 'Â¦ I was not theonly one -who was
dreading- Prince Tuen's : emissaries at
Lynx* Island ! ; And that â¢ was what I
wanted to know. " /
I rode on '- with the Cossacks ' for a
number "of- miles. From one of them
with whom Â¦ I ; could * converse I_ found
that they, were! in bad humor over bur
business. Moreover/; they ' had : become
suspicious of -the Quelpartiens, who," I
was told," were armed as'no-riative'cav^

as the -day; wore on, their, words kept

Two courses were open to us; a diffi
cult (if not impossible) climb down the
side of the mountain, or a long round
about trip along the summit, down the
descending western slope to the Japan
ese village, then through Wun Chow
to the shore of the bay. Secrecy. wotlld
demand that the former course be
adopted if It was within the range of
possibility.
As I have said, I was unable to bring
myself to act on my suspicions of Col-,
onel Yon Li. I have stated them in the
order x in which they arose, to show
what* must have .been my perturbed
mental condition when I arrived on the
ground. Jn proper order it will be seen
whether or not I acted rightly.
Once In Wun Chow, Colonel LI ad
vised me to take my Cossacks to the
Japanese village, where we could find
niore comfortable accommodations at
Japanese inns,- while. he and his men
remained In Wun Chow. It is needless
to say I went with great misgivings,
for I had resolved not to let the man
out of my sight, unless .necessary to
prevent raising his suspicions of my
doubt. But now, at the outset, I was
compelled to choose between my fear3
and Colonel Li, and, brought to the
point which I could not evade.with
out discomfort and embarrassment, I
assented without betraying a shadow of
distrust. He promised to follow quickly
after me and pilot me' to the temple on
the island for a preliminary survey of
the ground.
In fact. I had not finished my late
tiffin when he came clattering up .with
fresh horses, and we were off. Fording
the narrow inlet which at low tide was
not more than two feet deep, we gained
tiie mountain and began ascending the
narrow, stony path.
Once on Lynx Island,' I felt a new In
terest In our mission. Added to this
freshening zeal. Colonel Li was instant
ly, full of much necesary information.
The monastery, of Ching T llng had been
'.raised to the rank . at the time ot the
Queen's death. This exaltation in rank
made necessary a'number of alterations
in the temple, a larger. and. more elab
orate service, and n greater number of
priests, the number of "the latter<being
doubled from ' twenty-five to fifty.
I cornmented, to myself, that the
additional force was undoubtedly a
soldierly! set of men-, and well armed
-Vand" priests! Colonel Li further In
formed me that none of all this retinue
knewV the nature of the treasure they
Â¦ were; guarding, save the Â¦, three high
priests, : but that all knew -that when
; the monastery was made of ; first rank
a precious gift was laid within i the al
tar/ appropriate to its exalted position
One of these steamers was lying at
anchor in the harbor of Wun Chow,
surrounded by sampans. Another was
Just clearing Â£he harbor as we entered
the village, the black trail of its smoke
lying along the horizon, making the
sentinels of Lynx Island look like di
minutive smoking volcanoes.
But my eyes passed quickly from the
merchantmen and rested long on a lit
tle white speck on the blue waters^ â the
yacht Dulcette of the Russian man-of
war Ulric, which was stationed at Tsl.
The little craft lay floating near the
precipitous side of Lynx Island, evi
dently as near shore as possible, and I
confess my spirits rose as I watched it
rise on the swell of the sea. Then my
eyes ran from It to the shore, a dis
tance of two hundred feetâ how could
â¢we bridge that leap?
From the^hore I looked up the steep
side of the mountain, and my heart
sank within me, for it seemed a well
nigh impassable course down which to
bring a burden in the dark of night.
The mountain side, was serrated with
great ribs of rock extending from end
to end. .Here and there the dark ra
vines seemed, from my standpoint on
the beach at the village, more impass
able, even, than the rugged face of the
mountain side. Our burden, I, doubted
not, would weigh no less than six or
eight hundred pounds and I knew that
the Temple of Ching-ling (so It was
called locally) was on the summit of
the island, though I could see no trace
of it.
THE TEMPLE OF CHING-LING.
Wun Chow Bay is a basin measuring
about two miles both in width and
length. On three sides it is bounded by
the mainland, which ends in a prom
ontory of Jutting rock. On the fourth
or south side a mountain of an island
rises three hundred feet from the sea.
The harbor entrance is a narrow inlet
between the promontory or the main
land and the eastern extremity of Lynx
Island. Several picturesque rocky fig
ures stand out of the water in the in
let as if to mark the mainland's an
cient boundary lineâ the sentinels of
Lynx Island, a nightmare to^captains
Inward bound. On the' western shore
of the bay was the small native village,
and around the western end of Lynx
Island, on the little neck of water di
viding it from the mainland, was a Ja
panese village; for this was an open
port and a regular landing place for
Japanese steamers .plying between Na
gasaki and northern Chinese ports.
CHAPTER VL
It was 6 o'clock when I again looked
at my watch. We were Just trotting
out of the old West Gate of Kejnning,
for I had found Colonel Li and "liis es
cort forming in the barracks parade,
the Cossacks looked rather disgusted
in their outlandish oriental garb,
though taking it all good-naturedly,
like the soldiers they were.
Once in the open country the Quel
partien cavalry scurried ahead, a mot
ley crowd and ill-horsed. Behind them
rode Colonel Yon' LI. My Cossacks
came after me, well-horsed, silent, and
looking neither to the right nor the left.
Beyond them, as I looked back, lay the
old walla of Keinning; before me, fifty
miles as the crow flies across' the
mountains, the Buddhist monastery on
Lynx Island, and its Imperial
Three miles from Keinning we passed
the completed mausoleum where the
Queen was soon to be burled. Colonel
Li fell back and explained this to me.
A mound of solid earth fifty feet high
contained the great granite. tomb above
which was suspended a monstrous.tab
let. When the sarcophagus was placed
within the tomb, this tablet was to be
dropped, and no human power could
raise It again and disturb the royal re
mains. Colonel Li Informed me that
this was the second tablet Imparted;
"Forgive me, Dulcine," and I seiz-d
her bended shoulders in both arms;
"you would not have me refuse, would
you?" 0
The. w*>t face was slowly lifted to
mine. "You know I would not, Rob
ert," she said. And I drew her to me
now In the silence which was broken
only by the rustle in the little room far
beyond and the flutter of the dying fire
which cast a red glow over our mottled
throne.
"For to know is to fear," whispered
Dulcine: she did not tremble now. I
knew she liked my uncompromising at
titude (I ", had always laughed those
legends to scorn out of principle),
though she did not possess the guile to
counterfeit it as I did.
"I thought father would trust Dej
neff anywhere," she said thoughtfully.
"He Is more needed here than I, and
your father happens to dare to trust
me." I did not know how the words
would sound until I blurted them out.
The girl's hands went to her face, and
the echo of my own words cut my heart
right and left.
"Rot," I burst out, angry with myself
for the chill of fear that ran through
me at the wild words. "No wonder Col
onel Oranoff chose another man than
old Dejneff. He knows too much and
believes it all."
What the devil the Chinese Prince
wanted of the remains of the former
Quelpartien Queen was more than I
could guess. I kept a crowd of ques
tions back, and at last Dulcine crept
nearer me and I felt her tremble as she
whispered: -'Â¦'Â¦â¢:';*â¢
"You have forgotten Dejneff's legend
that insanity comes upon the relatives
of the dead who are desecrated."
"It began with the King," Dulcine at
last replied; " he said Tuen was paw
ing Quelparte over for the dead Queen's
body."
I had not. I knew Prince Tuen of
China had, through his agents, caused
the murder of the Queen and that he
lojiged for the downfall of Whang-Su,
the King of Quelparte. More than this
I knew little.
It was a moment before the answer
came, and then it came slowly as
though with pain:
"Have you not heard the talk of
Tuen?"
"Oh, perhaps to remove an obnoxious
quantity," I answered with assumed
lightness.
"Father does not send men on er
rands like this to rid himself of them."
I saw my chance.
"What do you mean by 'errands like
this'?"
"Away?" she echoed: there was
something more than surprise in her
tone.
"I am ordered with Colonel Li to
Lynx Island to bring back the body of
the murdered Queen."
Dulcine started at the words, and I
felt surer than before that there was
something about this miserable Queen
that I did not know â and God knows I
knew enough! I kept silent, ready to
seize upon the girl's first words.
"Why you rather than Dejneff?" she
said, at last, after looking into the fire
awhile.
"I am, to go away."
I looked at my watch. It was 2
o'clock. Then Dulcine came smiling
sleepily, but anxious and full of ques
tions. We presumptuously drew the
King's tawny throne up to the fire and
sat down. Colonel Oranoff entered a
little room off from us which contained
his private desk and sat down to a pile
of papers which he stirred busily now
and then.
"What is it, Robert?" Dulcine whis
pered, coming suddenly close to me.
"Be seated and I will call her. Col
onrl Li will await you on the barracks
parade at daylight. Remember you can
telegraph me from Han Chow." ,
"I shall be ready to go. Colonel - t
Oranoff." said I, with as much candor,
I hope, as earnestness (and I looked^,
him honestly in the face as I said the 1
words), "when I shall have seen and
said good-by to Dulcine."
He was sorting the papers on his ta- ?
ble when I said these words, the mean-/
tng of which could nc-t have been mis
taken by any man. Ke paused as I
uttered them, and pretended to exam
ine more carefully a paper he had
lifted from the table. But his eyes
were looking over it and he was star
ing at the green table cover. He stood
still a moment, then gathering his
papers quickly. (in very little order) ir.
to a secret drawer, he turned frankly
upon me and held out his hand.
"A squad of Quelpartien cavalry with
Colonel Yon Li and twenty Cossacks
disguised in Quelpartlen uniform will
await you when you are ready to go,"
said Colonel Oranoff, and, though he
walked away to his table, I knew by
the slight rising inflection of his words
that he meant to ask me how soon that
could be. - â¢
pleased him, I think, though his face
instantly sobered:
"But wait. This is a more difficult
mission than you have thought. First,
of all -we are gaining in Quelparte in
these days, nothing is to* be kept perma
nently except this very Lynx Island. If
Port Arthur cannot be retained for any
reason. Wun Chow Bay is to be the ter

agents on the yacht Dulcette, are at
work there- now making private pur
chases whiA 'will enable us to control

fort to obtain the sarcophagus must not
be allowed to jeopardize these negotia
tions now pending." â¢
When at last Cdonel Oranoff, though
by implication only, gave me an oppor
tunity to decline the service, I drew up
quickly and saluted, for I would not
have withdrawri for "worlds, and I
knew he knew it.

The sound was'as 'though a gigantic

and it rang and rang in *ny ears un
pleasantly. Â¦ -
the other had broken on the first trial
drop. The present slab had stood one
test, by being -dropped upon a' tempo
rary foundation. A second test was to
be made to-day.
Indeed, we had, not gone far when a
strange noise "came over. the fc>ot-hllls
with the wind. Colonel \ LI nodded . to
me, saying: ' . ) â¢
"The great tablet has stood the test."
Frequently, as we talked in low
tones, Colonel Oranoff looked quietly
at me, and I felt, long before Prince
Ting left, that I was to be employed in
this singular but vitally important mis
sion, and, as Oranoff returned from the
door through which the Prince passed
out, I could not resist the Impulse to
grasp his hand.
The gpontaneoueness of the action
Ah having withdrawn but Prince
Ting, we three drew close together.
Colonel Orancff summoning me to a
place beside them.
From the conversation, I learned that
the Queen's body was being secretly
kept in a Buddhist temple on Lynx
Island In Wun Chow Bay. sixty miles
westward from TbI. The "round moon"
(full moon) came on the 19th. This
was the 10th. There were nine days,
therefore, in which to bring the Imperi
al sarcophagus a distance of one hun
dred and fifty miles by water and
twenty by land to the Rusian Legation
in which we sat.
"You will need me no more, gentle
men," he then said, turning to depart.
"Trust Prince Ting and have all in
readiness o4i the night of the round
moon. I go even now to invite the for
eign representatives; you will do the
rest." Turning to go, he electrified me
(the others seemed* not to notice it) by
turning to Oranoff and saying with a
laugh:
"Yes; you will do the rest! Ha, ha,
ha!"
And now Colonel Oranoff spoke quick
ly to him in a low tone, and, satisfied,
at length the King called Prince Ting
to his side, to whom. In a low tone, he
gave several orders in swift succession.
"Your Majesty has been correctly In
formed; the mausoleum is quite com
pleted." But this did not answer the
King's question, and he instantly arose
to his feetâ
"Yes, but the Queen's body," he
cried, lowering his voice.
All had arisen with the King.
He had Just broken his fastâ for,
since the murder of the Queen, the King
of Quelparte slept when the world was
awake, and met his Cabinet and issued
his heathen decrees when the rest of
the world was "asleep.
Colonel Oranoff at once got to the
center of matters.
"Your Majesty has consulted the
soothsayers?"
Wang-Su bowed, 6miling blandly.
"And the Imperial funeral will be de
creed as we planned?"
"Yes," answered the King of Quel
parte, taking the cigarette from his
lips, "on the night of the round moon,
that Is, Ifâ" and he glanced quickly to
a nobleman near him. Prince Ting.
The latter knelt, then rose, saluted,
and spoke:
His Majesty broke the spell of roy
alty for me by sauntering into the
room, codding to one and another of
his Cabinet, touching a hand here and
calling *a name there, and then by
dropping on the sofa and lighting an
Egyptian cigarette which he drew from
a silver case.
About the room were seated those
whom by dress I took to be noblemen of
Queiparte. They rose when I entered.
Impressed no doubt by the sumptuous
military dress in which Captain Dejneff
compelled me to appear at the legation
and barracks. No sooner were all
seated than I perceived the company
awaited some one. All were silent, and
sat facing a sofa covered with tigers'
skins which had been drawn into the
center of the apartment. After a few
moments a secret panel moved and a
stately figure, in spotless Quelparticn
robes, stood in the doorway. I sank to
my knees saluting, wflh the others.
It was Whang-Su, the King of Quel
parte.
But even as I pondered these things
I received a summons to Oranc-fTs office
in the King's wing of the legation.
Were my questions to be answered so
soon ?
"We have them." he laughed softly,
as we rode back to the legation. "Mar
tyn, tell Oranoff to-night that we shall
be ready in a week."
I wondered what he would be ready
for; and if I was silent that evening in
the salon with the ladies it was because
I felt we were swiftly approaching the
climax of the drama. Of this I had
been assured by Colonel Oranoff him
self, for, the "silent conquest" going
smoothly, little nc-w was left but to
have the Russian protectorate openly
declared to Quelparte and to the world.
To guard against an uprising of the
populaoe it had been decided to post
pone the announcement until a favora
ble opportunity occurred in the shape of
a public holiday or celebration. Toward
this Ortinoff's plans were heading with
success, and the funeral of the mur
dered Queen, long postponed, was pro
posed even by the King himself. The
pageant, as planned, would occupy sev
eral days while the nation took a holi
day. IVith minds set upon this, there
was little or no danger c-f an emeute on
the part of the Quelpartiens.
The talk in the salon had centered
about this pageant, and the ladies were
particularly interested in learning of
the preparations made by the native
government, for royal funerals in Quel
parte are well known to be the high
water mark c-f heathen mummery and
oriental extravagance. Everything was
spoken of save the one incidental fea
ture of the orgyâ the Queens sarcopha
gus? and her remains. With a strange
fatalism my mind continually reverted
to this very center of the proposed cele
bration which was so skillfully evaded
by every one.
I attended Oranoff continually at
first, but as. he found it less and less
necessary lo move about, 1 was often
detailed under Dejneff. who was
"straightening out" the army; between
us we were whipping into line a regi
ment or two that could at least march.
More than that could not have been ex
pected of us. The wonder was that we
were so far successful, and when we
drilled in the avenues near the palace,
the admiration of the thousands who
gathered was Dejneff's solace. It was
plain his ambition was not to have an
effective army, but. if possible, to awe
the populace. After the last review the
old intriguer's beard was full of soft
songs. I had conducted the maneu
vers while he with his interpreter min
gled with the crowds. He heard what
was said!
perfectly. The King, after the Japan-
China war and the murder of His Queen
by Chinese renegades, had . fled to the
Russian legation; here well "in hand,"
he had been played clean to the hilt.
Old Andorph had secured practical
possession of the mint and customs,
nr.d Dejneff had come quickly into the
good graces of Quelpartlen army offi
cers. Scarcely a night but a banquet of
one kind or another was served in the
great dining-room c-f the legation. The
boxes of roubles, brought merrily up
from Tsi by troops of thundering Cos
sacks, often needed replenishment, but

I cannot tell how disconcerted these
awful suspicions, bred by my Cossacks'
idle talk, made me, and at the first
thought- of failure I became sick at
heart." The capture of the 4 Imperial
sarcophagus would, I knew well, make
no earthly difference with the length of
the dynasty, but I was not so sure that
the knowledge of such a capture would
not stagger : the King's brain and that
of every relative, and so, in reality, ful

My* Cossacks were riding their horses

turned up the steep path, his horse wet

In the citadel of any fortress defended

than the sword." they say in Quel
parte. But cowl and eword were here.
Our horses were climbing away vig
orously, and soon we neared the sum
mit of the .hill? where a picturesque
scene greeted our eyes. A great can
yon spilt the summit of Lynx Island,
and from one rocky side to the other
a green vale extended, perhaps two
hundred yards wide. A number of old
trees stood upon the grasy plat, and In
the distance appeared tho temple roof,
its gable ornamented with clay mon
keys of life size, which, the Quelpar
tiens believe, will preserve any build
ing from evil spirits. As I saw their
grotesque little figures silhouetted
against the distant sea I wished for
once to believe with old DejneS in their
power. As we pushed on more rapidly,
a second building came Into view, dis
tant a hundred yards from the temple.
This, Colonel Lt had forgotten to ex
plain, was an auxiliary dormitory for
the twenty-five additional prnests
brought to the monastery when It was
made of first rank. It was merely a
long, straw-thatched native hut. As
we drew nÂ«ar, what I had taken to be
the wall of the temple appeared to be
an outside wall surrounding the temple
Itselfâ an unusual but not unheard of
method for the protection of temples
from vandals.
I shall never forget my first ride into
this canyon of Lynx Island. My eyes
saw everything, and my ears caught
every sound. Eagles were circling over
the cliffs above us. White caps danced
on the far-off sea, visible through the
vista of the canyon. A gong was
sounding somewhere, and thin metal
fishes, suspended on the tongues of lit
tle brass bells, hanging on the temple,
floundered desperately in the wind,
ringing their bells to keep oft evil
spirits.
*From his latticed window the gate
keeper saw us coming, and took Colo
nel Li's package within. Soon a priest
came hurrying to meet us. It was plain
that we were expectedâ but I did not
think of this until afterwardâ yet
everything sugested it, from the clean
swept quadrangle to the spotless attire
of the attendants. A gong sounded,
and the priests came out from the tem
ple chanting, some passing out of the
gate to their auxiliary building, the re
mainder entering huts which were built
against the inner side of the walL Colo
nel Li informed me that the ceremony
just concluded was the last but one
to rfb held over the Queen's remains, for
on the following day, at this hour, the
final service was to be performed ac
cording to the King's orders .just re
ceived. The high priests. Colonel Li,
and I now passed within the temple of
Chlng-ling.
In the dim light, the candles on the
altar were first visible, and Incense
filled the air. Between heavy curtains
I could barely see the image at the
farther end of the room, within the in
ner court, where" none but the high
priests might step; and to this spot my
eyes went quickly and remained, for
there, perhaps beneath those very can
dles, lay the embalmed body of the
Queen!
As I peered forward, the three men at
my back sDoke to each other swiftly
and in low tones. Frequently I heard
my name mentioned, but all the rest
was meaningless, since they spoke the
native language. I need not more than
refer again to the lurking fears which
beset me whenever suspicions became
uppermost in my mind. I remember
thinking, as I stood there blinking into
the darkness toward the dimly lighted
shrine, that If Colonel Oranoft was be
trayed, no man had ever been duped
by more cunning tricksters; and the
highly comforting speculation followed
that if he had been betrayed my life
was not worth the vapor that rose from
yonder burning candle.
Soon one of xhe men, who had been
introduced to me as General Ling, fa
miliarly put his hand on my arm. and
led me toward the Inner court. Turn
ing from the Image upon which I was
gazing with equal curiosity and ex
pectancy, the man pulled away a thick
mat from the floor and lifted a trap
door, and, unceremoniously grasping
one of the sacred candles from the al
tar, he sat down on the edge of the
black, square hole; then getting a foot
hold on a ladder, he crawled, awkwardly
down. I followed. If I had known I
was going to my grave, I could not have
retreated. The ladder was some six
feet In length and stood in a narrow
hallway cut into the limestone rocks.
Numerous dark passages went off in
cither direction into inky blackness.
At the end' of a long walk General i
Ling stopped and stamped upon the
floor, then, leaning over, he scraped :
away loose dirt, and with much labor I
lifted another heavy slab trap-door. Â¦
Again he went down, and again I fol- <
lowed him, on wide stone stairs, into a â¢
still lower apartment. The room was <
heavy with foul air, but another odor j
was unmistakably present â a perfume i
faintly floating In the air! General 1
Ling paused on the lower step, and,
turning to me, grasped my hand and
looked me in the face while he raised
the torch above his head.
I peered into the scented room. A
moving object first appeared. In a mo
ment, as I looked, I beheld a face, and
started, 'gasping. Then I saw it was a
soldier, standing silently "at atten
tion" and looking at General Ling.
We gee come things first by averted
vision. Ty such, means there came
slowly into my sight a long, glittering
object, by the soldier's side. For a mo
ment, while It grew larger and more
distinct, my eyes were fixed upon the
soldier's stolid face.
When at last I could hook, I saw,
resting 1 on two great beams thrown
across the little room, the golden sar
cophagus of the Queen of Quelpartc.
CHAPTER VIL
A LAST SERVICE.
As we ascended to the temple Gener
al Ling explained the plan which had.
been formulated by the high priests,
subject to the approval of Colonel Li.
The final service in the temple had been
set for two o'clock on the next day, as
I have said, and in the meantime every
preparation for the removal of the sar
cophagus was to be made â floors
opened, doors widened, trusses built.
After the service, and not until then,
were the priests to be made aware of
the presence of the sarcophagus, and on
their shoulders it was to be brought up
Into the temple. Although Colonel
Oranoff had informed me that a- new
sarcophagus would await the body, at
the Russian Legation in Keinning, lest
the one at at Lynx Island be Injured
during the transfer. General Ling had
already made a great wooden case In
which to place it preparatory to its re
moval. 'The total burden would be
eight hundred pounds, which, he af-.
firmed, could be borne down the face of
the hill by the fifty priests, with-the aid
of blocks and tackling, -without danger
to the sarcophagus, even If the outer,
case should be marred.
In this, as' in all else, General Ling
seemed to be a most sensible and faith-"
ful servant of the King. We had
reached the foot of the ladder which "
would / take us again to the temple
shrine, when the man suddenly sank to
the floor and he grasped my hand as I
put one foot on the ladder. I turned,
and, from being the cool, far-seeing,
resolute man I had thought him, he
seemed' to become a child as he fairly
sobbed to me:
"Sir, you cannot guess what terrible
years these 'have been. Here, with only
fifty men, I have been placed to watch"
â and Tie nodded toward the room from
which we had come â "that which is
more precious to the King than life it
self. You may or may not know why.
The first year I could scarcely sleep,
for when I did, a sound as of distant
thunder came to my ears, and for days
thereafter I could close my eyes no
more." Tears were running down the
poor man's pallid cheeks as he spoke.
"But finally I learned to sleep, sir, with "
both eyes open, sitting upright at my
table, on which I balanced myself with
my elbows. But why do I tell you this?
âthat you may mention my faithful
ness to the King. Of It he knows little
more than my success. I would that he
knew the fears I have undergone for
his sake and the eternal vigilance with (
which hJs secret has been gruarded. I
have become an old man in these forty, ;
months and have little longer to live. I (
have a sonâ Kin Ling, in the Quelparte' â¢
irmy. Tell the King he will serve him (
faithfully as I have, and even uptil .
J*Â»ath." '
There was something bes4des the j
pathos of the man's plea^ that touched 1
ne, the sense of the Justice of the 1
?reat reward which he seemed to' feel
ivas due his laborious service. Arid he
isked it not for himself, but for an only
!on. I promised then and there to
'speak to the King," though I used the
tvords merely in the conventional sense.
He was pleased, and we ascended into
;he lighter dimness of the temple, but
10 one being in sight, as we entered the
nner court/ I paused, for I too had
something to say:
"But during these years, General
Ling, have there not been many whom
rou have suspected of treachery?"
"Yes, sir," he answered as quickly
ind as frankly. "I have suspected allâ *
int. inv^plf '*
"Colonel Li?" I suggested.
"YÂ«s, Colonel Li," he responded; then
ie added after a pause and a shrewd
.urn of his head: "But not so much as
,'OU."
"You may trust me," I said, holding
mt my hand. He clasped it tightly, \
or on my honor and faithfulness hung *
he success or failure o^ all these long
lights and days of watching, and he
mswered almost pitifully:
"There is nothing else to do.''
As we entered the area without the
emple Colonel Li appeared with the
lorses, but I had other plans which
communicated to him, and he rode off
ilone. Calling General Ling, I asked
lim to pilot me down the mountain
Â»ath.
Passing outside the monastery walls,
was taken to i- footpath which went
lown the rocky side of the canyon, t
loubling back on itself frequently to r
ccomplish the feat. Once on the crest c
if the rocks the view was entrancing, "r
or the sun was Just setting , in the i 1
nountains beyond Wun Chow. The
ay below, so perfect in outline and s
7vely in color, seemed a great opal in h
he quiet, dying light. From a certain t
raft Just leaving the little pier at s
Vun Chow, a weird sound came. A C
tately figure in white was standing lnl f!
he prow beating a flabby drum, behind a
;hich a dozen men pulled at their oars,
riving the barge slowly across the bay. t
General Ling informed me that this
eremony was performed at the be
inning of each native month to keep
tie devils of the sea from entering the
arbor.
My eyes mo\-ed slowly from the white
figures in the barge to the trim little
craft riding at anchor near-by, and I
thought .of its mission to Lynx Island.
Neither the , monotonous throbs of the
flabby drum nor the rocky sentinels of
Lynx Island had kept it out. While
looking for devils, a boar came in un
noticed! I was surely becoming a phil
dsopher of old Dejneff's school! Wo
pushed on downward, for the light was
waning. General Ling slowly picklnr?
his way. At first I thought he was
cKbcsing it as he went, but before long
I saw stakes had been driven In" th/?
ground by some one who had fully an
ticipated all that I had been dreading.
Through rocky defiles", down j steps as
high"" as those of the great "pyramid,
along little grassy ways at the very,
verge of a precipice, the stakes led us.
In" actuklly making the "-'descent, ; one
,did not fiud it such a difficult task. : As
we neared the bottrim rhy guide signi
fied the necessity of his returning' be
fore it became too dark, and we parted,
after arranging that I should be at the
monastery at\2 o'clock. thV following
afternoon. I found my way easily to
a sampan, where,, I need hardly say,,
my ietters rnade fne a welcomed addi
tion to a jovial party of men. v Spirits
here ran high, for. the mission, of the
Dulcette had been consummated and
the boat now only waited it's cargo
to be oft! for Tsi.
Lulled to sleep *by the gentle rocking
of the waves, I made up for two sleep
less nights and barely came from ray
bath as tiffin was served. I had little
more than time to climb the steep path
of the stakes when the last service over
the body of the late Queen of Quelparte
was begun^ .
I should observe here that the ; Dul
cette was brought fifty feet the
shore on; this morning, and f our sam
pans were lashed together and
boarded over . to convey v - our burden
to the yacht. According to the King's
orders, General Ling had been com
manded.to fire the monastery immedi
ately upon the removal of the sarcopha
gus; secrets of which I have only the
merest . suspicion i undoubtedly con
nected with_ the anticipated Russian
possession of the island, rendering this
waste of properly necessary. - Accord
ingly, I had ordered my Cossacks to
station themselves on the road-to Kein
ning behind the village at sundown,
ready to start for the capital the mo
ment the light of the" flames appeared
on the â¢summit_of Lynx Island. By
them I sent a message to Oranoff, stat
ing the success of my mission and that
of the Dulcette.
, As I entered the temple a hundred,
tapers sprang to light. candles on
the altar were at the same time in
creased, showing up' the hideous figure .
of the image unpleasantly. Some one
was reading/in a: nasal tone from a
Tibetan book, : and during the reading
the. three score" priests entered* the
building, bearing swinging torches.
Upon entering they knelt; then, with
noiseless feet, they formed a procession
arid maryhed slowly before- the image
af Gautama.
If It should be i'my lot to witness
many, august ceremonies.'I doubt if I
;ould remember, another as I do the one
if that memorable night on .Lynx
tsland. There was something in it of
:he heathenism of ancestor worship
ne peoples â something which suggested
.hi-, religious fervor of India, though
Mended with'and" discolored by the
luller dross of Chinese superstition..
Whatever it may have beenâ I cannot
icscribe Itâ that marchof those monks
in'd their monotones will never be for
jotten while life shall last. And when
;ver I listen to chanting, my ears sqem j
o hear, above the. song of the singers,
he chant I heard that night:

When half the procession had passed

ewitched. The swinging torches, the *
lonotonous chanting, the perfumed in- *
ense, all combined to make me what I Â«
ad never been beforeâ somewhat of an
lolater myself. ''Â¦Â¦ .t
At laBt some one touched me and r
poke. It was General Ling, and when i
e asked if I was ready, I looked out a
iirough a crack in a paper window and '
aw it was growing dark. Already riny
ossacks were ; awaiting my signal of; t
ames. Already the Dulcette had lifted *
nchor and was in full heat to be off. t
I tightened my belt, felt of my pis- a
)ls, and answered him: "Yes." â¢

The darkness was not altogether due v
to coming night, for a storm was blow
ing in" from* the murky. Yellow Sea, al
though the long service had- lasted to
near the day's end, when General Ling
came to me.
For some reason I had felt in no
hurry to begin the night's work, for a
strange quiet had come over me, in
te"nslfled fpurfold by the service to
which I had altogether given myself,
up. After three days of intense mental
and physical activity, I was enjoying
a reaction and recuperation. Not that
my fears were dead, or my anxieties
â¢ forgotten, : but from the moment I met
General 'Ling- 1 felt a' new confidence in
myself and in those about me. . He had '
suffered suspicions for four mortal
yearsâ suspicions of every one,-includ

Upon this motto Â»I had acted since I

Ling and Li had done everything.' The '_
sarcophagus was as good as on the Dul
cette. My Cossacks .were no! longer
needed, and were spoiling. to return to
Keinning. Consequently, I had written '
to Colonel Oranoff, and stationed them
to await my flaming signal to be off. I
was particularly glad to be able to dis
pense with their presence as the secret ;
of Lynx \ Island was confined to so
many less tonguesâ arid soldiers'
tongues are lose at both ends, as all
the world knows. Â¦ ' Â¦ " w '
At the 'conclusion of the final cere
mony the priests had been taken to an
inner room,' where Colonel Li im
parted to them the nature of the King's
orders touching the j immediate remov
al of the sacred treasure of the temple
and the utter destruction of the temple
itself. , The astonishment of the priests
can be Imagined, but not the scene
which . followed. Old men, whose lives
had been spent at Ching-ling) came out
weeping and moaning, and here and
there they leaned against the walls as if
to embrace them for a last time. Some,
crowded about the image on their knees
and prayed with quaking voices; others, >
most of them younger, began running
about like frightened* deer, while jbme '
fell Into groups in the corners, Â¦ whis- 5
pering to each other In their haste. <
Evidently fearing \ that all control :
over his men might be Jost,, Colonel Li â¢
hastened to read yet another decree '
from the King, which detailed each '
priest to service In other temples, and 'â¢
gave to each a sum of money from the 1
royal treasury. This had the" desired â¢.!
effect over the younger and, more rest- p
less of the men, who otherwise were 1
quite beside themselves ; with "disap- '

failed to beireconciled by pecuniary. re-| ' 1

Vithin the audience room, had been
tripped of all decorations save the"
eavy curtain which | hid .the Inner
ourt from view, frorn which the image
f Gautama was brought into the cer
Â»r of the temple.
"A hot Nirvana for him," thought I,
s I paced restlessly by amid the con-'
usion, thinking of the end that was .
pproaching it.
After a long wait the priests from the
irther. building came in a bodyi and a
lore frightened crowd of men I hope. I
lay never see. Those in the front rank

'ere those who cringed and- shrank.?
heir officers, who now ojranly asserted .
ieir r , authority, much '* .to my relief,
randished sabers, and urged on the
mid with sliarp words of command .
nd not a few savage thrusts.
All being ready, General Ling drew
ack the curtain which hung before the
Iner court, and exposed a, great fect-^
ngular hole in the j floor made by rais- ,
ig| the; stone flagging 'above the hall- ;'
ay.?* Ajs torch was given I to each of the .vV.
foremost men, and, taking. a torch him
self, General" Ling leaped down. The
men followed In dead silence, .curiosity
overwhelming their fears and sorrows,
and crowded down the narrow hallway
with many muttered exclamations of
astonishment. Upon reaching the end
of the dark passageway another great
opening met their wondering eyes. A
large space had been opened directly
above the stone stairway. Down the
stairs we passed, and the room below
and its secret was In plain view.
I looked about me Â¦ at the peering
faces," as the men stepped forward to
see the contents of . the apartment.
With his usual foresight, General Ling
had had the sarcophagus placed within
the wooden case, so that a. plain box,
five feet high and seven feet long, was
all that was exposed to view. I did not
know Jiow many, if any, of those men
dreamed what the box contained, but I
thought by the action of some that they
suspected that the "sacred treasure" of
Cling-ling" was a corpse. But, my im
agination being a capricious quantity,
I put aside idle speculation and went to
work with the .others.
. It was plain that the most difficult
task' before usâ at least within the
templeâ was to move the box the first
step, or up the hallway above the room
in which it rested. The stairway was
cut in the solid rock and could not be
removed, j Moreover, it was composed
af wide steps and only five of them in
number.V Hopes were let down and de
flected into the room and placed around
the box, and repeated trials were made
before there was any gain.- When at
last the box was lifted, the ropes could
lot be raised sufficiently and the weight
swung to the steps, striking them with
i terrific crash, which showed, for one
hing at least, that it was solid and able
:o stand all that could be reasonably
jxpected of it.
Li Â«dld not care to have that experi
nent repeated, and he inquired imme
liately if there was not a roam directly
ibove that in Avhich the box stood.
3eneral Ling answered affirmatively,
md Li advised that the floor of that
oom be taken up. His suggestion
;eemed a practicable one; the work was
nstantly commenced. A number of
nerf went above and the work of rais
ng the floor and removing the loose
llrt was begun, and with Colonel Li, I
ruarded the sarcophagus, those about
is clearing away the debris which fell
hroughthe growing "aperture. Sud
lenly and without warning a great
lab, loosened' from Its bed of sur
ounding dirt, came crashing down up
n us. I barely escaped having my leg
aught upder it; and a priest at my
ide,' who had been especially valuable
>ecause of his authority over others
nd his notable activity and watchful
ess, received a terrific blow on the
;ead 'and, sank with a groan between
!olonel Li and myself.
Colonel Li jumped quickly to the
oor' man's rescue, and with my as
letance drew him from the debris and
ust into an adjoining apartment,
'hich I had not seen before, where the
aldiers who had guarded the sarcopha-'
us slept. The blow had been received
lirly on the head, crushing in the wire
et in which Quelpartiens put up their
air, and had inflicted a serious if not
ita! wound.
Men were at once sent for water, and
remembering my flask in the pocket
f my great coat, went to the temple,
here I had cast it aside.
As I hurried through the temple of
hing-ling for my whisky flask, I felt a
jmethfng in the air which gave me a
idden, terrible warning. I thought at
rst the accident had played a little
ick on my nerves, and. as I retraced
iy steps, I drew away at my flask my
;lf. But hoâ it was not that. Every
ling took on a new appearance, and I
- dodged at my own shadow on the walls
j Men were hastening by me, runnin;
r through the halls and the temple
, stumbling 'on the ladders and dlsap
r\ pearing through numerous doors; th
: accident is being reported, thought 1
t and the simple-minded and supersti
: tious are disturbed by It.
. â¢ Thus I argued the case within me a:
'I ran down the steps Into the roon
! where the sarcophagus stood. Thi
â¢ room was quite empty. Above me th<
work of removing 1 the floor continued
; the workers having started up a sing
i -song chant such as Quelpartiens in
, dulge in while working. But below i
: strange silence reigned. Seeing th<
, torchlight in the further room, I hur
, ried thither, flask in hand,
i I shall not describe the sight whict
met my eyes in all its frightfulness o;
detail. Colonel LI and General Linf
were standing near the center of th<
room, each looking at the other ir
speechless horror. In Li's hand wa:
his sword, the blade hidden behind his
robe. - '
On. the floor before them lay a head
less corpse. â¢
Both men attempted to look at me
but they could not take their eyes f rorr
each other. Together they turned like
automatons; still staring one anothei
In the face, speechless. â¢
"A sharp stone," I gasped at last,
drawing my revolver.
Then, slowly, Colonel Li's other hand
came up from his side, drawing after
it what seemed to me a black cord.
And he raised aloft the head of the
corpse at his feet, holding it by the end
of its finely braided queue.
"ThÂ© Chinese!" We three spoke the
words simultaneously. Then old Ling
dropped his face into his hands, but
Li lifted his streaming sword and,
with an awful oath, struck again the
headless body at his feet.
Such was the dramatic announce
ment of our betrayal in the Temple of
Ching-ling. Prince Tuen, in order to
secure the Queen's body, had corrupted
the priests of the temple. The man
accidentally injured was a Chinaman
who had joined the priests without de
tection. 1 He was perhaps the leader of
the. awful plot. Thus, in a few swift
words, w'e analyzed the situation.
' Feeling my revolver in one hand and
my flask in the other, I replaced the
weapon and drank from the flask.
Then I passed it to my companions,
and the liquor restored us. Instinctive
# ly drawing our swords, we dashed up
' stairs. The building seemed quite de
serted. Here "and there, however, we
found our men talking in frightened
groups, or, unconscious of the disturb
ance, working away at their various
tasks. Crowding them together, Colo
nel LI, = the genius among us, looked
them over quickly.
"We are betrayed," he said firmly.
"There are no priests here who live in
the outer building." To prove his ter
rible suspicions, he called a witless
fellow from- his task and sent him to
summon the priests from the outer
buildingback to their work; but as the
messenger i went Out, the gates were
closed securely.
A deep silence settled over the temple
as we waited. But our suspense was
not lasting. A rifle-crack broke the
deathly stillness, and its echo rattled
long in the rocky canyon of Lynx
Island.
Colonel Li was right; we were sur
rounded by armed servants of the'Chi
nese Prince commanded by Chinamen
in disguise. With us was the sarcoph
agus of the Queen, the preservation of
which determined the destiny of the
reigning dynasty.
And the temple was drenched with
oil! vv\^

J collecting. The population of this fair land of
ours â at least, according to the views of the
most competent foreign observers who have never visited
the United States â is divided into two classes: those who
pay and those who receive. Most of us are in the former,
but Mr. Moregiin was one of the most prominent mem
bers of the latter class. If the ancient adage anent the
blessing that will accrue to those who give has any truth
in it, there must be a strong demand on the blessings
treasury from the American continent alone. Mr. Morer
gain and his confreres, however, were of the opinion
that a coin in the hand is more to be desired than . a
blessing in the bush.
It must not be assumed from this that that worthy
gentleman was a member of the genus porcine. As a
matter of fact, he was very modest in his desires. He
didn't want any more money than there was in circula
tion, and he was even willing that a little should be left
in the hands of the common people, in order to promote
enthusiasm in tbc pursuit of it. This is an important fact
that is often overlooked by the critics of . the modern
millionaire. Any one who has had the opportunity to
observe the ways of that wily bird on his native heath
knows that the attractiveness of coin collecting is not
due to any vulgar desire to heap up money, but to the
excitement of the chase. When he goes forth in the
morning to his daily task in the marts of trade the
millionaire is comforted and upheld by the cheering
thought that each day brings its duties â and its dubsâ
to be done. Each man who drifts into the plush-lined
and gold-mounted office of the millionaire may have a
large wad of greenbacks concealed about his -person that
he is very anxious to retain for his own selfish pleasure
and profits.
It is surprising how many selfish people there are in
the world and how hard the much maligned and over
worked capitalist has to struggle to get the beggarly pit
tance of forty-five per cent necessary to support his mbd
cst establishment on Fifth avenue, his cottages at New
port, in the Berkshires and at Aiken, his steam yacht and

. The plan was a cood one and the only trouble with
it was that it wouldn't work. When he wandered into
the club to begin the billiard tournament in the middle
of the first afternoon after he had emancipated himself
he found it inhabited entirely by liveries occupied by the
salariea minions of the place. There was not a million
aire in sight. It was the same next day and all the days
thereafter; millionaires out of work seemed to be as rare
as flying machines that will fly. Then he tried one of
his country, houses, but the first day he saw a newspaper
story of a big bulge in Peanut Limited on the floor of
the Exchange, and was half-way back to the city before
it occurred to him that he -had sold his seat and was
engaged in doing good to his. fellow man in an entirely;
different manner. .
In despair he took the next boat to Europe, thinking
to find surcease from sorrow in wandering over the
storied Continent. The only acquaintances he met there
were the 'wives, and daughters of men who were at home
unwinding ticker tape. Every time Mr. Moregain saw
anything about a big day on the Exchange or an exciting
evening session at the Waldorf he would begin to look
up the time of the next boat to New York, and two or
three times his wife caught his coat tails just in time to
keep him from starting to walk back.
The few men that he met who. owned up to having
been born in the States had been out of the country so
long that they didn't speak the American language any
longer. He tried. to rest, but had forgotten the formula.
Then he went in for art and endeavored to add to the
incomes of the artistic world. Before he had been at
this many weeks he found that he knew about as much
about art as a native. Hottentot and that he was regarded
as one of the easiest things that ever blew into the Quar
tier Latin. He couldn't even talk art, to say nothing of
understanding-it. /
There was only one thing left for him to do, and he
did it; he died gently but completely and at last accounts
was still dead. : The; doctor's ; verdict"' was. that he had

leave the. furnishings at least for the next man.
By dint of hard and. heroic efforts he finally arrived
at something near the, point that he had seen in his
dreams. Both of his ; fair daughters had annexed ances
tral domains, with titled accompaniments, and his son
had a seat on the Stock Exchange; and. barring. accidents
and untoward decisions, might be expected to keep him
self going with 1 an occasional lift from the family ex
chequer. Therefore, ' Mr. Moregain announced to his
wife. that henceforth, if not forever, he was out of the
game. No more for him; the daily toiling in the shadow
of the Sub-Treasury, .where -his ears were tortured^all
day long by the dull, sickening thud of the common stock
and, the monotonous drip of the water from the first pre
ferred. No more for him. the hollow, uncertainty as to
the exact 'nature of the surprise that '.the next day might
bring forth. He would get out.of the collecting business
and set about making glad the heart of his fellow man.
Besides, it was getting so difficult to. make money without
investing real capital that it wasn't worth while. to bother
with 1 it any longer. â¢ His sole business now 'would be to
spend his declining years' in leisure and count up the
interest on fifty millions. in a perfectly safe investment.'
His first move was to go out and. look- for some
congenial souK to spend those. declining years: with him.
His idea was that he would go aroundto the club every
afternoon and play billiardslwith some other retired mil
lionaire or '.alk about the , victories of the past withthe
other financial warriors ; who had exchanged thearmor
for the smoking jacket. ; When this gotTtiresome he could
hie him to one of his i country houses and chase the elusive
golf ball . over, the hills and dales, oiryf oregather with the
other J ball, not : so elusive, on the clubhouse veranda.

and damages for lacerated feelings and persons of . the
common herd who still harbor the absurd idea that the
streets were made for public use.
But as we were saying, or at least meant to say, Mr.
Morcgain was no common thirster for wealth. He had
a firm determination tucked away in his mind somewhere
that when he had accumulated a modest competence of
say fifty millions, had picked up all the coronets necessary
to establish his daughters firmly among the denizens of
the effete but attractive Old World, 'and had paid his
son's college debts, he would retire and live a life of ele-,
gant leisure, with nothing to do but to clip an occasional
coupon and keep one eye on the stock market. He wouid
then become a patron of the arts and scfenccs arid might
even.be induced to found a university or two if he. could
find a convenient spot not already 'occupied by an insti
tution of learning. I
He had not made any definite date with himself when
he would make his positively last appearance on the
financial stage, but he, had an idea that it would be one
of the events' of the day and would be heralded as the
most auspicious act since the. inauguration of the coal
trust. Then he wouldibe.able to travel. in ease. and com

ried out by its Bkillful staff of officials.
Stress is laid upon the fact that
without Â¦â¢ the instrumentality of the
banking system, trade and industry
could not possibly be. carried on to any
thing like, modern developments. The

labor is divided and, applied to;innum
erable divisions of human activity.
Arid, although the daily^operatlons of a

in reality all its' methods, . as well as
those * of other financial agents, are
based upon the elementary ; principle

SPRING HUMOR
Comes in With the Birds.
THE days of the frisky spring
lamb and the twittering pee-wee
have brought with them three
booklets which "are to laugh."
Whether or notthe gentle reader will
laugh depends upon that nicely bal
anced modicum of humor which may
or may not be his. Nothing is so hard
to -cater to, as the good public's sense
of humor, for though a city full of
people may have the emotions of love,
sympathy, curiosity, patriotism in al
most equal endowment, their several
conceptions of the humorous will vary
with, each individual. So Edward
Townsend's new "Chlmmie Fadden"
book, and George V. Hobart's "Eppy-
Grams" by "Dinkelspicl" and "I Need
the Money" by "Hugh. McHugh" will
have a different appeal for every
reader.
; The writer of this brief review can
not praise or 1 censure any of these
little books unreservedly, for that
would' hold him up as -one de
void of a healthy humor in the
eyes 'of those who might take ex
ception to-h,is criticism, and nothing
is. so mortifying as to have that slur
cast upon one's mental equipment. Let
him say, then, with all due humility,
that he could find nothing funny in
"Sure," the "Chimmle Fadden" book,
that "Eppy - Grams" was mildly
amusing and "I Need the Money"
screamingly funny.
Edward Townsend's Bowery boy
died several years ago, and the effort
to reanimate him is a ponderous and a
laborious one. > The present book lacks
all the spontaneity and the novelty of
the former one and the conceits are
painfully forced. "Eppy-Grams" may
be dismissed with the word that it is
a collection of sayings In^German dia
lect from Hobart's well-known Dinkel
spiel letters. "I Need the Money." the
sixth of the "Hugh McHugh" books,
is capital, like its fellows. The laugh
lies beneath the bewildering fantastics
of slang. It cannot be analyzed, for
really there is nothing tangible to ac
count for the laugh save the surprise qf
the delightful argot. For example,
some people may not think it funny
to read of six-story flats with 10x12
rooms as "people-coops." Others with
livelier imaginations wilt hold their
sides over this. There again is the
indeterminate quality of humor.

The nuthor calls this story a war
time comedy with a tragic interlude.
The comedy is sufficiently diverting to
hold up the reader to. the last page;
the tragic note in the book is just
strong enough to throw a softening
shadow over the whole and put the
lighter elsments into subdued relief.
War time and the romance of the sol
dier and his sweetheart offer Brady a
Held for a deal more sympathy of hand
ling than does the hard, clashing at
mosphere of "the street."
His tale is laid in Charleston, be
leaguered by the Federal ileet of Ad
miral Vernon. At the very outset the
heroine. Miss Fanny Glen. , is caught
between the fires of conflicting loves
on the part of two dashing Confederate
officers, and things seem to be coming
to a very ugly turn when, the mag
nanimity of one of them throws to his
rival the opportunity to make a name
for himself in daring adventure. _JJut
it is Just at this point that Fanny
Glen proves herself the little traitor
which the book's title proclaims her
to be. 4 '.-V-V?;/V~ \.~*
By a clever piece of strategy the lit
tle woman prevents her chosen lover
from fulfilling his dangerous mission,
and the other, the magnanimous one,
goes out to his death in the crazy
torpedo-boat David. With this tragic
interlude brought thus suddenly to a
close the little comedy of the arrest of
both the lover and his sweetheart and
the impending trial for a multitude of
egregious offenses runs merrily on until
it draws to a happy close.
By more than the measure that "The
Corner in Coffee" fails of being good
reading, "A Little Traitor to the
South" lays, claim to that distinction. t

"THE VINEYARD/*
â¢ Mrs. Craigie's New Novel.
Â£L* I rHE VINEYARD." the latest
** 1 story of John Oliver Hobbes
X (Mrs. Craigie) is a book to
be read for study rather
than amusement It' is a powerful
story, a deep story; one which goes
way below the surface of trivialities
and deals with life problems the most
serious. None of Mrs. Cralgie^s stories
are trivial or superficial. HeVgenius
savors more of the Meredith and
James type than of the characteristics
which belong to. the writers of pretty
little Dresden China romances of the
day. This last story of hers is of a
more serious character even than
some of her previous efforts.^ It Is
a careful analysis of the complex man
ifestations of the love passion between
man and woman.
The motif of her book is the clash
between the spiritual, idealized affec
tion of a woman and the worldly, self
ish love of a man. Her story out
lines the line of cleavage between the
passion . which is of the soul and that
of the body; how hopeless of realiza
tion is the one. how sordid in its very
essence is the other.
The heroine of the story loves the
man whom she has chosen with an
affection almost transcendental in Its
purity and complete severance from
the secret forces of humanity which
make man and woman inseparable.
The man loves the girl selfishly, as one
who must come to him to make his
life of desired ease and luxury com
plete. Mrs. Craigie has analyzed
with a keenness of insight the struggle
between* these two natures, trying at
first to reconcile themselves the one
to the other, but failing and gradually
drawing apart by the very, insistence
of their characteristics. It is a re
markably subtle study.
The characters of these two are de
lineated with dll the" firmness of line
necessary to throw the problem of the
story into a clear light. Federan. the

BRIEF REVIEW
of Other Recent Books.
CHARLOTTE PORTER and Helen
A. Clarke are doing a good work
in their production, play by play,
of *he "First Folio" Shakespeare.
Already "Midsummer Night's Dream."
"The Comedy of Errors" and "Love's, a
Labor's Lost" have come from their ed
iting, and now "The Merchant of Ven
ice" is the fourth to be added to the
list. This is a good .work because their
books are in the. exact text of the orig
inal folio cf 1623, a photographic repro
duction save for the improvement upon
the archaic type. The true Shakespeare
scholar should not be content with tha
interlarded, expurgated, thoroughly
mangled text which ha3 resulted from
the busybody editors' work of these
many years. The editors cf these first
folio reproductions have relegated all
these blue pencilings to the footnotes,
where they should be; authorities and
their changes in the original text are
thus placed In ready reference for com
parison. These volumes become verita
ble pocket variorums by reason of the
wealth of critical and editorial mat
ter displayed. "The Merchant of Ven
ice" contains a preface, an Introduc
tion, literary frontispieces from rare
editions, notes discussing its argument,
sources, duration of 'action, date of
composition, and early editions, liter-
ary illustrations, glossary, variorum "^
readings and selected* criticism. The
variorum readings alone would serve
to differentiate it from ordinary edi
tions, and when coupled with the glos
sary and other scholarly editorial work
of the painstaking editors the result
becomes a mine of Shakespearean com
mentary.

seriously. He evidently realized that
with his "A Little Traitor to the South'
appearing From another publishing
house almost simultaneously with th*
birth of his coffee story, there would
be occasion for some invidious remarks
uj>on the prolilic character of his fic
tion machine. Forearmed, therefore,
against the rellections of his critics, tha
lately Reverend Cyrus Townsend take-,
his readers into his confidence with a
â¢â¢preliminary discourse." in which he
confesses that he wrote a part of this
story to order as one would fill a de
mand on a wholesale hardware store.
"Therefore I boidly announced (to thi
importunate editor) that while I did not
have a story I v.-ould write .one for
him. JSasier said than done." How truo
this Srst word "The Corner in Coffee"
witnessed.
Again lifting the veil from the hal
lo-wed sanctuary of the author's study,
Brady advises the reader that some
severe rebuffs from critics of a former
story had led him to decide upon an
innovation in the line of characters for
the present one. Some one had asked
the impertinent question. "Who cares
anything for the love affairs of a
young man of twenty-two and a girl
of eighteen, anyway?" This put th^
author upon his mettle and he decided
tc show his versatility by picturing a
love affair between a man at least fifty
and a girl thirty-five. In "The Corner
in Coffee." then, the tender passion is
to blush its rosiest in blossoms well
blown. That last word, and the story
begins.
Elijah Tillottson. the bachelor lover,
is a hybrid cross between Si Perkins
and Alkali Ike, who has come to New
York with a roll of South American
money tu see aaid be seen of society.
He is the plaything of the upper ten
on account of his barbarisms of speech
aud mannerâ barbarisms, by the way,
which are strained venjr near to the or
dinary "Rube" eccentricities of the
vaudeville stage; but these very crudi
ties commend him to the blase tastes
of Miss Constance Van Benthuysen
Livingstone, aetat C5. the old-maid
heroine whom Brady has resolutely de
termined to clothe with a pale violet
halo of romance. At his second formal
call upon the ripe object of his affec
tions the redoubtable Elijah pops thu
question and is allowed to hope for the
best. A fine Quixotic spirit in him
prompts him to defer coming to his
own until he can prove that he is not
a fortune hunter by raising his modest
one million dollars to ten. To do this
he sets about to corner the coffee mar
ket.
Soliciting the financial assistance of
a friend from the woolly Brazils, Elijah
succeeds In getting the coffee market
well within his fingers when he discov
ers that the rascally brother of his
lady love has plunged all his fortune
and that of his sister into the balance
against the corner. Then follows a re
markable thing. Not only does Tlllott-
Bon "go broke" himself by breaking his
own corner, but that convenient friend
from Brazil, who has, of course, no in
terest in the deal excepting that of
helping Elijah win his lady with dol
lars, readily consents to lose every
cent In the crash in order that a lady
whom he had never seen might not
suffer. Hardly has the reader had time
to catch his breath after this remark
able piece of chauvinism before the
story closes in a sweet calm.
One cannot rid himself of the idea
that In this story the author is not at
all in earnest, and that, in fact, he
wrote It in delightful dalliance with
experiment. The characters are pain
fully hackneyed; the" blase O. M. of so
ciety, the cloutish Jackdaw in the so
cial swim whose heart is true blue, the
fool Englishman of saving qualities and
the weak young brother, turned embez
zlerâthese lay figures have worn even
the melodramatic sock threadbare. The
machinery of the coffee 'change, which
Brady has adduced to work up the
climax of the plot, does not move with
the spontaneity which comes of a sun;
'handling. Fact is, Brady explains in
his useful foreword that he had to se
cure the services of a broker and a
ton. more or less, of literature on the
subject before he could unravel the in
tricacies of bull and bear battles.
"Easier said than done," saith Brady;
the author who promises to write a
story to order. Well spoken, that.

"Oh, I know," mimicked Mr. Sharpe.
scornfully; "the same old crowd. You
ought to have come to me before. It
will take something to overcome your
own reputation. How much will each
take?"
"We'll fix that O K if you take hold,"
answered Greenbaum, laughingly.
"We've got over 100,000 shares and we'd
rather some one else held some of them.
We ain't hogs. Ha! ha!"
"But the distillers?"
"They are In the pool. I've got most
of their stock in my ofllce. I'll see that
it does not come out until I say so." Â¦
There was a pause. Between Sharpe's
eyebrows were two deep lines. At
length he said:
"Bring your friends here this after
noon. Good-by. Greenbaum."
On the minute of 4 there called on
Mr. Sharpe the eenior partners of the
firms of Greenbaum, Lazarus & Co., I.
and S. Wechsler. Morris Steinfelder's
Sons. Reis & Stern, Kohn, Fischel &
Co., Silberman & Lindheim, Rosenthal,
Shaffran & Co. and Zeman Bros.
Mr. Sharpe appeared at the thres
hold.
"How do you do, gentlemen? Don't
move, please; don't move." He made
no motion to shake hands with any of
them, but Greenbaum came to him and
held out his fat dexter resolutely and
Sharpe took it. Then Greenbaum sat
down and* said. "We're here," and
smiled blandly.
"Greenbaum tells me you wish to
pool your Turpentine stock and have
me market it for you."
All nodded; a few said "Yes"; one^ â
Lindheim, aetat 27â said flippantly,
"That's what."
"Very well. What will each man's
proportion be?"
"I have a list here, Sharpe," put in
Greenbaum. He intentionally omitted
the "Mr." for effect, upon his colleagues.
Sharpe noted it, but did not mind it.
Sharpe read aloud:

the millionaire senior partner of the

scrutiny, as though to ascertain the
exact condition of Sharpe'e health.
"Yes. you must be. I haven't 6een you

"You didn't come up here Just to tell

Greenbaum looked at him admir

said: "I am discovered!"

"What's the matter with a pool?"
"How big?" coldly.
"Up to the limit." Again the trust

Hallo, Greenbaum."
In the course of the next few
months, after a aeries of injudicious
fluctuations, which gave to "Turp" a
bad name, even as Wall street names
went, despite flowing accounts of the
company's wonderful business, and
after distributing less than 35,000
shares, thÂ«? members of the "Turpen
tine SkindJcate." as it was popularly
called, sorrowfully acknowledged that,
while they had skillfully organized the
trust and had done fairly well with
the bonds, they certainly were not
howling successes as manipulators.
During the following months
they sold more stock, f They spared
not the widow nor the orphan. They
even "stuck" their intimate friends.
They had sold for something that
which had cost them nothing; It was
natural to wish to sell more.
It was decided to put "Turp" stock
in the hands of Samuel Wimbleton
Sharpe, the best manipulator Wall
street had ever known. Greenbaum
said he would conduct the negotiations
with the great plunger.
Sharpe was a financial freelance,
freebooter and freethinker.
Greenbaum was promptly admitted
to Sharpe's private office. It was a half
darkened room, the windows having
wire screens summer and winter. In
order that prying eyes across the street
might not see his confidential brokers,
whose identity it was advisable should
remain unknown to the street. He was
walking up and down the room, paus
ing from time to time to look at the
tape.
Mr. Greenbaum took charge of the
market conduct of "Turp," as the tape
called the stuck ot the American Tur
pentine Company. At first the price
was marked up by means of "matched"
orders â preconcerted and therefore not
bona fide transactions.
All the manufacturers who had re
ceived stock In part payment were told
most impressively by Mr. Greenbaum
not to sell their holdings under any cir
cumstances at any price below $75 a
chare.
"In such, a market," "thought Mr."
Greeribaurhl "Sharpe can't'pos3ibly tell
he's 'getting stock from me. In. order

strong. ) _ ; . . â¢ - Â¦
The stock fluctuated between 60 and
65. It seemed to be having a resting
spell. But as it had' enjoyed these peri
ods of repose on three several occasions
during the rlse^-at 40 arid 48 and. 56â
the public became, all the more eager
to buy it. whenever It : fell to 60 or 59,
for the street was now full of ' tips that
"Turp"' would go to par; And such
was the public's \ speculative temper
and Mr. Sharpe's | good work that dis
interested observers, were convinced
the stock .would surely sell above 90 at
the very least. Mr. Sharpe still bought
and sold, and the big block he had beeri
obliged, to take ; In- the course of his
manipulation difninished. On the next
day he hoped to begin. selling the pool
stock.
They implored, individually and col
lectively, Jacob Greenbaum to call on
Sharpe; and Greenbaum, disregarding
a still, small voice that warned him
against it, went to Sharpe's, ofllce, and
came out of it two' minutes later some
what flushed, and assured his-col
leagues one by one .that Sharpe was
all right, and that he seemed to know
his business. Also th'at he was cranky
that day.
And still Sharpe, wonderful man that
he was. gave no sign that he was about
to begin unloading.' Whereupon the
other members of the pool began to
wish he were not quite bo preedy. They
were satisfied. to quit, they said.

Shaffran & Co. and Zeman Bros. It
was the same message to all:

There was consternation and dismay,

There were some large blocks of stock
for sale at 66. but, Sharpe's' brokers
cleared the figures with a fierce, irre

Oh the next day '.came the "second
chapter "of the big Turpentine deal.
Mr. Sharpe, having received the pool's
114,400 shares, divided it into three lots
â40,000 shares, 60,000 shares and. 24,400
shares. â¢ The market had held fairly

Then Sharp* called in all the stock
his brokers were loaning to the shorts
and he himself began to borrow it.
This, together with the legitimate re
quirements of the 'big. short interest,
created a demand so greatly in excess
of the supply that Turpentine loaned
at a sixty-fourth, at a thirty-second, at
an' eighth and finally at a quarter pre
mium over night. It meant that the
shorts had either to cover or to pay $25
per diem for the use of each 100 shares
of stock they borrowed. On the 31,400
shares that the syndicate was borrow
ing It meant an expense of nearly $8000
a day, and in addition the stock was
rising in price. The. shorts were losing
at the rate of many thousands a min

end would be, but it certainly looked
Etormy for both the real and fictitious

He saw through the time-worn device

sell such a large amount must be his
colleagues. He also was convinced
that their breach of faith was not a
concerted , effort, because if they had
discussed the matter they would have
sold a smaller ; quantity. He knew

plices, duped or coerced into selling
enough other distillers to aasure suc
cess, cajoled the more stubborn,
wheedled the more credulous, gave way
gracefully to the shrewder and gath
ered them all Into the fold. The Amer
ican Turpentine Company was formed
with a capital stock of $30,000,000. of
200,000 shares, at $100 each. The cash
needed to pay Greenbaum, Neustadt
and others who sold their plants for
"part cash and part stock" was pro
vided by an issue of $25,000,000 of 6 per
cent bonds, underwritten by a syndi
cate composed of Greenbaum, Lazarus
& Co.. L & S. Wechsler, Morris Steln
felder's Sons, Rels & Stern, Kohn, Fis
chel & Co., Siberman & Llndheim, Ro
ecnthal, Shaffran & Co. and Zeman
Brothers.
In due course of time the public sub
scribed for the greater part of the
$25,000,000 of bonds, and both bonds and
stock were "listed" on the New Tork
Stock Exchange â that is, they were
placed on the list of securities which
members may buy or sell on the "floor"
of the exchange.
Tabularly expressed, the syndicate's
operations were as follows:

"Gentlemen and Greenbaum, you^all
know what I did for Turpentine on the
up-tack. Around 62 I began to strike
gf. me stock which I couldn't accoun:
for,. I knew none of you had any for
sale, of course, as you nad pledged me
your honorable words not to sell save
through me. But the stock kept com
ing out, even though the sellers bor
rowed against it, as if it were short
stock, and I began to fear I had met an
inexhaustible supply. It Is- -always
best on such occasions to act promptly,
and so after driving in the real shorts,
I sold out our stock. The average price
was 40. If it had not been for that
mysterious selling it would have been
f 0. After commissions and other legiti
mate pool expenses I find we have
made 9 points net, or $1,029,600, of
which 25 per cent, or $250,000. come3 to
me according to the agreement. It. is
too bad some people didn't ' know
enough to hold their stock for SO. But
there is so much stupidity in the dis
trict. I trust you are satisfied. In
view of the circumstances I am. Yes,
Indeed.' Good day, gentlemen; and you
too; Greenbaum, good day!"
sÂ» Outside they compared notes, and in
'a burst of honesty they confessed.
Then, illogically enough, they cursed
Sharpe. The pool was not "ahead of
the game." ; They had so much more
stock on their hands than they desired
that in reality they were heavy losers.
And as time wore on they had to buy
more "Turp," and more "Turp," and
still more "Turp." They thought they
could emulate Sharr>e and rush the
price. up Irresistiblyâ at any rate up to
50. They declared a dividend of 2'per
cent oh : the" stock. But they could not
market .Turpentine. Again and 'again
they tried; and again and again they
failed. And each. time the failure was
worse,' because they had to take more
stock.
.Turpentine stock had declined fifty
points . in fifteen business hours. It
meant a shrinkage in the market value
of the company's capital stock of $15,
000,000. The shrinkage in the self-es
teem of some of the pool was measur
able only in billions.
Sharpe notified his associates that the
pool had- completely realized â 1. e., had
sold outâ and that he would be pleased
to meet them at his office. on Monday â
this was Thursdayâ at, 11 a. m., when
he would have checks and an account-
Ing ready for them. He refused him
self 'to Greenbaum, Wechsler, Zeman,
Shaffran and others who called to see
what could be' done to save their repu
tations from the wreck of Turpentine.
The stalwart private secretary ; told
them that Mr. Sharpe was out of town.
He was a very polite man was the sec
retary, and an amateur borer of great
proficiency;. - Â¦'-v<{ \ â¢ . Â¦
Failing to find Sharpe, they hastily
organized a new pool, of a self-protec
tive character, and sent, in "support
ing" orders. They were obliged to take
large quantities of stock that day and
the next in order to prevent a worse
smash, which would hurt them In other
directions. They found themselves with
more than 50,000 shares on their hands
and the price was only 26 to 28. And
merely to try to sell the stock at that
time threatened to start a fresh Tur
pentine panic. : _
They met Sharpe on Monday. His
speech was not so short as usual. . He
had previously sent to each t man an
envelope containing a check and a
statement, and now he said In a mat
ter of fact tone:
"Somebody has been selling on us. I
don't know who. I wish I. did. I was
afraid j 1 might have to take 100,000
shares more, so I Just sold as much as

speak to me." -.Vv
"This has gone too far,** said Green
baum, hotly. "You must give me an
explanation, or by heaven I'llâ" .
VGreenbaum," said Mr. Sharpe in 'a
listless voice, "don't get excited. Good
by, Greenbaum. Be virtuous and you
will be happy." And he resumed his
caged- tiger pacing up and down his of
fice.' As by. magic Mr. Sharpe's burly

The bears had it all their own way.
Everybody was selling because some

gross violation of the anti-trust law
and that a receiver had been appointed.
Having sold out the last, of the pool's

but Â¦beyond, that no news came to
'Frisco of Captain Larsen^ and his
crew for. a long time.
One day the rHawaiian. mail steamer

taking place. A confused mass of men
were surging about the deck, but dis
tance made it impossible to distinguish
just what; was taking place. Suddenly
the leee ciew of themairisail, which had
been raised to the; yard, came down on
the run, and hid the scene of trouble
from view^ â¢ ,
â¢ ?'Now,' he's getting it," chuckled Se
attle Mike.
Al Black seized the" glass gleefully.
"They'll be raising police signals
presently^" he remarked.
"Tes, or. squaring in for shore,"
"prophesied Mike.
-" But none of these things happened.
To the amazement of the two board
ing niasters, the foreyards of the bark
;were> suddenly braced up again -and
she" ploughed, on .. to the southward,
sending out long foam .whiskers -from
; hef cutwater. Smaller'and. smaller she
dwindled, until she' \vas hull down on
the â¢ horizon, s beyond the Farallones.
Then Al Black and his companion arose
and returned -cityward;vmuch'.i p"erple_x- ;

"You bet," added Al- Black, drinking
his beer with a dark frown, "we doesn't
stand no foolin'."
Captain Larsen's mild blue eyes, wan
dered wearily about the dingy office.
"Twenty dollars shipping fee is too
much," he protested meekly. "I am will
ing to gif the men a month's advance,
but I von't gif;you more dan 52 apiece
as shipping fee. Dat is choost vat de
law allows."
"Two dollars!", snorted Al Black sav
agely. "We* say 520, and we mean it.
If you don't come up with that price,
you "get no men." - - "Â¦-.-.
But they came to "no agreement. -.The
Aloha's skipper returned aboard with a
war ugalnst the Boarding Masters' As
sociation on his. hands. . : . ,
Next day â¢ he" opened negotiations
with Chinese Charley for a crew of Ka
nakas arid r Chinamen.- The United
Boarding "Masters smiledâ that meant
trouble for Captain' Larsen > with the
union. ,For a while, they decided to let
it go at that, but Seattle Mike con
ceived a plan whereby they might have
even a more' complete revenge. This he
at once communicated v to his associates
and they grinned more .broadly than
ever. It was. a game they had played
before, and always- successfully. Per
haps you have heard of the. mutiny, of
the Harvesters -. .â¢ ,-. . â¢â¢;
Next day they sent a note to Captain
Larsen stating that they acceded to his
terms-^-a . month's advance - for . "each
man. - "Anda nice' Christian crew we'll
send you," added the note. ]
."We'll- give him Three- Fingered Jack

down Al Black's wrong throat. Â¦/>* - ;

Next day the new crew of thsi^loha

manlike promptness the men j furled
sails and cleared up decks.

were on to the game.
They boarded the Aloha a few miles
off shore. Captain Larsen received
them at the gangway with his habit

eyes. But when the inspectors be
held Three Fingered Jack; Lager Beer
Pete, Big Steve, and their equally no
torious shipmates briskly pulling in
b rapes, ye-ho-lng and clewing up sails
in as orderly and shipshape a man

war, they swore aloud in their amaze
ment. Finally one of the Inspectors
got Three Fingered Jack aside for a
moment. --
+ _ â:*^
TO be familiar with maritime' af
fairs on the Pacific Coast means
that vou have heard of the Ha
waiian bark Aloha. The Aloha
has had many commanders, but
It Is not worth while to burden -your
memory with any of their names ex
cept that of Captain Eric Larsen. who.
I believe, sailed her until annexation
brought her under American colors.
Captain Larsen's name will be handed
down to local fame for many years to
come. When a master mariner has a
reputation it means that he is either a
most extraordinarily good seaman and
has a kÂ«?en ncse for fair winds, or that
he doc& things aboard ship not pleas
ant for decea*. shore-abiding people to
contemp!ate.
Captain Larsen's reputation was an
exception; it was not especially due
to either of these causes. His fame
was gained by his power to convert the
wicked of heart to the true course of
righteousness.
Previous to Captain Larsen's advent
on the Pacific Coast as mate of a largci.
British four-master the Aloha had â¢
been commanded by a bold, hard- "
handed Irishman, who divided his
time at sea between drinking whisky
&nd committing assault and battery on
his sailors. This latter pastime of his
made life miserable to the Marine Hos
pital officials in San Francisco and
Honolulu whenever the Aloha put fnto
those Dorts. That sort of thing went
a rood ways those days, when mari
time laws were vague and seldom en
forced, but finally the Aloha became
too notorious even for those parts and
the owners were obliged by public
opinion to remove Kanaka Hogan from
his command. From one extreme they
went to another. To take his place
they . engaged the meek and gentle
Larsen . . '.-\
On the first trip he broke the Aloha's N
previous records between 'Frisco and
Melbourne, and that placed him in hlj?h
favor with the owners. But by his
brother commanders of other ships
Captain Larsen was regarded with bu-
be well received by West Coast skip
pers. That a nailorman should declare
whisky and swearing wicked was, to
their minds, nothing short of .treach
ery to the brotherhood of seamen.
In San Francisco Captain Larsen's
piousness proved equally objection
able. He always insisted that the
boarding masters send him Christian,
God-fearing seamen who never swore,
and would not object to prayer meet
ings in the dog watches. Such men
were naturally scarce, but bo long as
the Aloha's owners stood. good for the
large shipping fees, they tried to hu
mor the eccentric Norwegian skipper.
Those were the days of blood money.
But one day there came a change of
management in the office of the Aloha's
owners, . and. among other things in
volved, Captain Larsen must, hence
forth manage the financial part of ship
ping his crews himself. That was- the
cause . of the trouble. The religious
scruples of Captain Larsen- arid .blood
money fees wouldn't mix in the 'same
pot. . â¢ - Â¦- .... . - x .
.In those, days the boarding : masters
of Frisco stuck together as thick as
thieves, and the shipping commission
era stood in with them.- -AH this was
for mutual benefit. Any- skipper -that
refused to put up. their price brought
upon himself their united displeasure,
and that was something no sane skip
per ever cared to: do. -Then it was
usually to a skipper's advantage in a
financial way to stand- in with the
boarding masters;. it was another case
of mutual benefit.
But Captain 'Larsen- conceived ;the
idea that blood â¢ money/ did not chime
in with the moral scheme .of ~ things,
so he cave voice to that opinion Just
about as he voiced' his testimonies on
the street corners of Honolulu."'
He met Seattle Mike and Al Black,
president and shipping, master^ of -the
Boarding Masters'. Association, in their
office partitioned. off in the" Fair Winds
saloon. -
-"Two . months' ~ advance for "each
man," demanded, Seattle. Mike. >.. "Just
$40â twenty tor us and twenty, to^square
up the men's accounts. ' You've' got to
tionists. .
To the popular disgust he would
sometimes step forward to deliver his
testimony; bashfully .at first, later
warming up enthusiastically, exhorting
the scandalized seamen to mend the|r
ways and be saved. He invariably Se
gan thus:
"Dearly belofed bredern and ship-'
mates: It is almost impossible to ex
press de joy of true salvation. I haf
never been so happy as since I found
Jesus. Vunce I vas a bad man, far from
de road of righteousness. Vunce I
drink visky and use bad lanvidge, and
vas not good to my sailors, but now,
tank der Lord, I have found salvation,
and I don't be so vicked any more."
Naturally, such sentiments could not
sen.
When the Aloha lay loading or dis*
charging in Honolulu Captain Larsen
spent his evenings ashore at Salvation
Army headquarters, ' and he even
joined the red-shirttd soldiers of Christ
in their street corner demonstrations.
There the seafaring population of Hon
olulu would often behold the A'.oha's
skipper, his bare head and broad shoul
ders towerins above his fellow Salva-
preme contempt. A religious master
mariner is never respected, more espe
cially if he belongs to the Salvation
Army, as did the good and pious Lar-

Al Black, purple with rage. "What fell
'd'ye mean, ye drunken swabs?"
4 "Hear the child of wrath." said Jack,
piously. "Boys, the time for the Lord's
vengeance has come."
The bos'n kicked back his chair, and
as though this were a signal all hands
sprang up, and in a moment the room
was in a savage turmoil, In the center
of which were Seattle Mike and Al
Black. Both of tl-e crimps drew re
volvers, but their weapons were hurled
acros3 the room before they could use
them. Down the two went under the
feet of the mpb, fighting fiercely. The
bartender and two runners attempted
to help them, but the first went down
with a split scalp and the other two
were trampled insensible In a second.
Next the infuriated sailors dragged the
two boarding masters into the kitchen,
where they ducked their heads Into the
dishwasher's tub, full to the. brim.
DishesC pots, pans and even the lamps
were piled on top of them and scattered
over the floor. Shattering glass and
trampling feet raised a most unearthly
ro".
Ducked into Insensibility, the two
boarding masters were then dragged
into the barroom, which was wrecked
in a similar manner. There would
certainly have been murder done /had
not a squad of police burst in the front
door just then and charged the drink
crazed ; sailors. Most of them were
rounded up after a desperate fight and
hauled off to the police station, but
not until a squad of reserves had re
enforced the original patrol. Al Black,
Seattle Mike and the bartender were
taken to the hospital.
Next day Captain Larsen appeared
at the police station and paid the fines.
"It griefs me," he said, as the men
followed him ' meekly . out Into the
street, "to find you in dls condition.
You haf given away to sinful wrath
again. Vat did you do to dem?"
"They're in the hospital," replied
Jack, with a sickly smile.
."Veil," continued the skipper, "in

fell easilylnto step at-her side.
"He was not there," remarked Ma
dame, briefly.
"Too bad," said the man. "Another
day lost." . â¢
"Yes," saldMadame, "and it is ex
pensive, this stiu-ing at. the Hotel Ritz.
"How much is left now?"
.. "About two thousand francs."
"Well, that's enough for another
weeV," mused Madame, as she and her
companion wulked toward the hote"!.
The following day Madame .Mon
tresor and the man walked into Gri
gon's shop again. The^clerk who harl
waited upon her came forward. "M. .
Grigon is within," he said.
Â¦â¢â¢* M. Grigon stepped forward. "What
would it be that you- wish?" , he in
quired.
. Then he looked at the young wo-,
nian. The man who had accompanied
her strolled toward the door and stood
swinging his walking stick.
"My father." ) began Madame, "Herr
Rudolph Richter, wishes me; to select
the ; gift which he proposes for my
bithiday. Yesterda;' your, assistant was
good enough to show to me a diamond
buckle which would' please me."
Grigon stared at her again. Her eyes
dropped, and a faint flush came into
her cheeks under 'the steady gaze.
' "Would.it be the Uurmah buckle?"
asked Grigon, finally. â¢ - .
"Perhaps. The t man did not say."
replied Madame.
Grigon turned to a huge safe and
1 took > from : it a tray : containing. gems
which an expert would have valued at
more than one fortune.
"That is ; the one." . said Madame,
; pointing to the most beautiful piece in
the tray.: t - v â¢ .
r ."That is the Burmah buckle," said
Grigon;
"'. "And its: price?" inquired Madame-
r "Eighty thousand francs," '..-. said.
Grigon.-
Madame nicked ud . the , buckle and
* - - -r i ilnilMiliiil
held It to her throat. "Is it well,
there?" she asked, and her glance fell
straight into the eyes of , Grigon.
"Adorable," said the â¢ Frenchman.
"To-morrow," continued Madame,
"is my birthday â the first since the
death of my husband â and my father
desires to give me what Â¦ I like best.
Now, If Monsieur would be good
enough to bring the buckle to the
hotel to-night I have no doubt that
Herr Richter will purchase it from
him."
That evening Grigon went to the
Hotel Ritz. Herr Richter appeared,
saying that his daughter was in the
garden. With Grigon he went in
search of her.
They found her in the balcony.
Grigon seated himself beside her, and
Herr Richter walked away.
Grigon took the wonderful gems
from the case. "I do not know,", he
began, "if Madame understands love
at first sight. She has had the good
ness to tell me that she has been but
recently made a widow, through the
unfortunate death of her husband. I
have seen Madame driving in the Bols
these many days, but until yesterday
when she came to my shop I had not

Madame will deign to show me the
favor of hoping that I may ask her
to be my wife, then she will accept
from me the Burmah buckle. In token
of her favor."
Madame looked at him wondering
ly: "Monsieur Is good," she said.
Grigon laid the buckle in her hand.
"It shall be as Madame wishes," he
said. He bowed and bade her good
night. On the veranda he met Herr
Richter. "I have asked your daughter
to be my wife," he tsaid, "and I have
left with her the Burmah buckle for

Richter .went back tb the balcony.
Madame held up the buckle for him

"That was easier than stealing it "
he said, briefly.
Then he continued, "What will you

LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
There is no doubt that the three-piece
suit will be the suit of spring. And this
means the return of th Eton. The
three-quarter coat will continue to be
â¢worn, and, for outing occasions, there
â¢will be the very long coat. And there
will also be the reefer, the little basque
coat and the corset coats and wraps.
But the Eton will be the coat of the
year.
And the majority of women will hail
its return with much joy. The Eton is
a coat whioh is becoming to the great
majority of women. It fits well and it
gives an opportunity for the display of
a handrome blouse waist. It also al
lows a woman to preFerve her belt line,
and .10 self-respecting woman is dead
to the great advantage which lies in the
preservation of the lines of the belt.
With the coming of the Eton there
has come a revival of the girdle, and
girdles of all etyles and shapes will be
a arn this year. Neither the Eton nor
the girdle is new, hut with their present
revival both of them will show new va
rieties which will make them seem
novel.
Girdles that are as wide as six or
eight inches and which come actually
? o the under arm seams arc fastened in
front to a wide though slender buckle
and are finished v.ith little tabs which
hang down In very pretty fashion.
You can make or break your reputa
tion for fashion by the way you trim
your giidle In the back. You can make
it a pla.'n and rather old-time affair
which merits not the second glimpse, or
you can make it a very nice thing
trimmed with long wedge shaped tabs,
upon which the handsomest buttons
of tha year are liberally displayed.
One of these girdles, which is to fall
fft the back of the ekirt in handsome
lengths, has* tabs that are embroidered
and trimmed with Persian bands In al
ternate rows. Lace Insets appear here
and there and the girdle is finally fin
ished with a very deep fringe, which
sets off the rather plain skirt very
handsomely in the back.
And what a holiday it Is to be far
The Three- Piece Suit-
will be charmingly set off by,
sa*y. a ligrht spring tone, developed in a
light spring material," and the man
dressmaker bowed Etill lower.
The place was New York, and the
scene a very fashionable dressmaking
establishment for women. It was one
of those spots which are Bometimes
playfully called "Lenten retreats." for
it is here that fashionable women flee
at the beginning of Lent to spend the
dull social days selecting gowns for the
next season.
And, if beauty bears any relation to
goodness â and who can deny it? â
there is abundant excuse for the little
.recursion, for nothing prettier could
possibly be imagined than the interior
of a fashionable shop during Lent.
"There is only cne thing in the world
better than Paris," said the New York
woman, sighing enviously as she looked
at the rheer stuffs, "and that Is the in
terior of a handsome American estab
lishment, for ovec here they have at
tractions which even the Parisian
dressmakers do not have."
"I can suit madame," continued the
man dressmaker, spreading out a beau
tiful banana colered voile, "for she
tfkould wear a suit of this description.
Madame is dark, rather slight, not too
tall and very well shaped. Madame
would look lovely In this."
The suit in question was of a light
banana, not yellow enough to be warm
when the July days come, nor too light
for serviceability. Its material was. a
durable quality of voile, one of those
voiles which wear like cashmere and
can be actually washed and made over
â¢when one is tired of the original style.
The suit was a "three-piece suit," as
the dressmaker indicated, and was
made with an 1830 skirt, with a lace
blouse and an Eton jacket. It was
trimmed with bands of Persian em
broidery, and the lace blouse waB dyed
a brown color to match the principal
tone in the embroidery.
*J*t THREE-PIECE suit by all

transformation was not a black collar
nor a white one. The latter is only for
elender figures and the former only for
those who dress in black. But it was a

Ruchlngs of all kinds are impressed
into the service and lingerie cuffs are

not removed and the lingerie ruffles
are put on over the shirt waist cuff,

custom. "â¢'Â¦*'<Â¦Â¦
The 1830 Tendencies and Lines.
"Preserve your 1830 lines," advised
a modiste to a woman who is rather
stout. "They will help you wonder
fully." , ; V -
"And how shall I do it?" asked the
â¢Jady, surveying her ample proportions
In the full length mirror which had
been rather cruelly provided by the
modiste.
"Let me put a Mrs. Bradley Martin
collar around your neck," said the mo
diste, "and you will see what I mean."
Taking a very wide lace collar from
a drawer, she threw it around the
shoulders, of her patroness, securing it
at the throat with a very large round
pin of turquoise matrix.
One of the very pretty ways for the
home dressmaker to alter her old
Eton and make It new Is by means of
the cuffs. The sleeves may be built
upon unalterable lines, but the cuff?
can always be changed about a little.
The woman with plenty of money

thread of gold. These lingerie cuffs
will be slipped on over the cloth cuff3
of the Eton and will be tacked in

very pretty lace frills of the sort which
mark the Eton as being right up to

"You take your hips ' and you shirr
them," so directed a seamstress to an
apprentice. The seamstress quoted is
in charge of a large sewing room at
the. top of a ; Fifth-avenue mansion,
where plain gowns ' are being made for
very fashionable mistresses to wear" at
Newport next summer. .; '
The material upon which the appren
tice was working was a gun metal
gray f oufard figured in blue. The skirt,
which was straight and fitted with
eight gores, had been "hung" and was
now being shirred around the hips. In
this case the shirrlngs were to be
what is known as rope shirrings, and
a great deal of material had been al
lowed for the insertion of the "rope."
Fashionable shirred, hip yokes are
lowered a little in the middle of the
front and raised In the back. This
gives a pretty dip which can be ac
centuated by "a dipping girdle, which
can be worn without a metal orna

"Scratch the gathers," sounded old
fashioned to modern ears,' when a mod
iste handed a skirt which she had just
fitted to a fashionable patron over to
one of her assistants. The skirt was
one which belonged to a cotton cheviot
shirt waist suit, and the gathers were
to.be literally scratched all around the
belt: Then the hips "were to be
strapped with a stitched band of the
goods. '.The material, which was light
in weight, was in a soft willow green,

INVITATIONS TO DINE (Mrs. W.
B. N.) â It would be very discourteous
to invite your husband's old friend to
dinner to meet several ladies and gen
tlemen and not include his young wife.
The fact that you have never met her
does not relieve you of the obligation.'
Make it a point to call with your hus-;
band when his friend and wife will be
at their hotel and then extend the In
vitation to dinner to both: or, you
may send a cordial note the next day
asking them to dine â informally to meet
a few friends. State the date clearly
and the hour, being very particular as
to full house number and. street, giv-.
ing anv other directions you may deem
desirable for their guidance as stran
gers in the . city. . A hostess shakes
hands with her guests upon their arri
val and upon their, departure as well.
ADJUSTING CORSETS PROPERLY
(C. B. R.)â When uglv lines become
noticeable about the hips it Is high
time to give more serious thought to
the corsets as well as to exercise. Fre
quently the trouble is not altogether
wrought by advancing years, but is
due to a badly fitting or incorrectly
adjusted corset which exaggerates
every faulty line. Manufacturers
boast that there are about forty, sjiapes
lm corsets, each slightly different and
made with a view to meeting the de
mands of some peculiar line discov
ered in feminine make-up. It is not
strange, therefore,, that women so
often make mistakes in selecting this
Important accessory. Many depart
ment stores now fit i their customers
without charge and this has proved of
great value "to those who were ; in
doubt as to what they needed. Do not
confound this plan with that of having
a corset made to . order, . for you are
merely fitted with the ready-made
style best suited to . your needs. The
made-to-order corset, while very desir
able, is costly. If the plan of having
the corset fitted at the store is not fea
sible In your location study your figure
carefully and note its peculiarities,
whether long or short In waist line; full
at bust, hips, . etc. ; then by consult
ing your local dealer the required^
shape of corset may be more ; readlljr
obtained. Do not get a corset too
large â it should fit to be comfortable.'
A good, guide for the average figure is
to have the waist measure of the cor
set two or three . inches smaller; than
the belt. To lace the' corset 'correctly
start at the top In the usual way and
when the waist line is reached pull out
CLEANING WITH GASOLINE.
(Mary.)â A few drops of gasoline rub
bed on a soiled spot only makes a bad
matter worse; while it will remove the
actual spot It will leave a muddy tell
tale ring around the outer edges of the
cleaned soot which is even more con
spicuous than tbe'original stain. The
best method is to immerse the article
to be cleaned, and if this is not advis
able consult a professional cleaner. As
gasoline is highly inflammable it must
be used with great caution entirely
away from the fire or the lighted gas
jet or lamp. After using gasoline 1n a
room open all the windows for an hour
or more and hang the cleaned articles
In "t v e open air until the fumes of the
gasoline have entirely evaporated.

PROTECTION OF THE SKIN.
(Ainiee.) â Skin that tans and reddens
badly even in winter should be pro
tected against the elements when one
Is out of doors by a veil of chiffon se
curely pinned to the hat. As the fad
is for numerous veils do 'not hesitate
to use all necessary to afford the proper
protection of your skin. Your milliner
will show you how to pin the veil to
your hat In a fashionable manner and
no one will ever suspect that you are
wearing It to protect your skin. Much
has been said and written for and
against the use of cold cream and pow
der on the face previous to going out,
but from observatlo-n it must be ad
mitted that such treatment rarely does
any good. Even when sparingly ap
plied, as It must be during the day,
the oily nature of the cream will cause
the face to look extremely greasy when
going into a warm room from outdoors;,
furthermore, while the cream protects
the pores, it also acts as a catch-all
and holds every particle of dust that
finds its way through the veil, so that
in the end the actual benefit derived is
somewhat' doubtful, aside from the soil-
Ing of delicate laces which may come in
contact with the face. Treating the
face before retiring will prove more
beneficial, and any increased redness
produced by manipulation will have
disappeared by> morning. Fir6t bathe
the face with warm water which is
soapy, rinse and apply a cooling whit
ening cream composed of equal parts of
oil of sweet almonds, rose water and
witch hazel with sixty drops of simple
tincture of benzoin. In the morning
bathe the face with warm water to
which a pinch of borax has been ad^ed,
rinse with cool water, dry and dust
with a pure face powder.
TRAINING CHILDREN (Mother)â
In a limited space only a few essen
tial points in child training can be
given, but you will find the, hints val
uable if you will act upon them. Offen
sive table manners seem to be nat
ural to the majority of children, and"
this fault should be taken in hand early
In their careers. Correct manners
should be taught and enforced as soon
as children are old enough to sit at
the table. Very young children must
receive oral Instruction as well as ex
ample until their small minds grasp
the ideas and how and when to apply
them. This may seem tiresome to carry
on daily, but It must be done. to pro
duce results. To overcome the con
tinual breach of good table manners on
the part of older children, and save
continual correction, I suggest that you
write out a list of correct forms and
insist that they be memorized, then
there will be no reason for such flip
pant excuses as "I. forgot," or "Did It
just for fun." Try to make them un
derstand that it Is never smart to N be
111 bred and that you appreciate and
admire any duty well performed, no
matter how trivial. As your governess
has evidently been very careless in per
forming her duties, nothing but an en
tire change In discipline will bring
about the desired' Improvement. Take
the matter of deportment firmly In
hand and Insist kindly but firmly upon
prompt obedience, and when a capa
ble governess Is secured co-operate
with her. m Permitting the children to
dine at the table with the elders as a
special honor for good behavior may
Inspire a desire for rapid reform. Tact
and firmness will accomplish more than
harshness. Â» j. Jn ijjjill

CORRECTING ONE'S GAIT (K. L.
M.)â If the hips and ankles seem strong
the'wobblv. gait often noticed In wo
men is probably due to nervousness
and a lack of muscular control of the
knees superinduced by weakness. Ex
ercise which will strengthen the leg
muscles and especially the knees will
be of benefit. Build up the system by
careful diet, sleep in a cool, well venti
lated room and walk as much as time
and strength will permit. To attempt
to walk several miles in one day and
then give up for a week from sheer ex
haustion iyfolly.'doing you more harm
than good. Begin walking by going a
quarter or. half mile each day, gradu
ally increasing the distance. Little fa
tigue will result and the muscles will
bi slowly strengthened. To derive real
health and pleasure from the walk, al
ways dress especially for the exercise
In a comfortable, sensible manner. The
skirt should escape the ground, that
the arras may be kept in a normal po
sition. A short jacket is preferable to
a long one. as it insures warmth with
little weight. Wear no heavy petti
coats or tight bands. The hat should
be a light soft felt, and the shoes com
fortable with broad heels; gloves
should be warm and loose. A chic
walking suit and a shirt waist is the
ideal costume for walking. In addi
tion to .the outdoor exercise follow
these exercises morning and night,
wearing only a loose gown. Stand
erect and raise the body slowly on the
balls and toes of the feet, coming down
again with the feet In normal position.
This will strengthen the muscles In the
calves of the less. To strengthen the
knees and the upper legs, stand erect,
then lower the body by bending the
knees only until the posterior muscles
and heels are as near together as pos
sible in a sitting position; then raise
the body erect without the aid of any
support. Repeat both exercises sev
erar times. To relieve any soreness
which mav, result from the first trials,
bathe, the legs with equal parts of al
cohol and tincture of camphor.

thefregular lingerie a generous supply
of black silk and a few colored petti

O 0 many ami so varied are
v^ the little perplexities
C^ that enter into almost
fffcvy woman's life without
iindin^ satisfactory solution,
and so many and so unusual
are the letters that are con
stantly being received from
women who cannot find an
answer to their questions in
any other way. that The Sun
day Call has decided to estab
lish a pa<ie devoted entirely
and exclusively to "What
Women Want to Know/'
which will be edited by
Madge Moore.
Here every trial or tribula
tion of the mind and heart
can now be poured out in the
full consciousness that it
will receive serious consider
ation â every question of fact
or fiction â of the home and
all its manifold tiesand tasks
â of the inner sanctuary of a
woman's life find ready so
lution. Ladies, this pa^e is
all your very own. What
would you?
If, during the sudden rage for metal
ornaments of all kinds and descrip
tions, you. miladi. have taken a vio
lent fancy to all things brass you cer
tainly are in clover, for there are any
number of pretty and quaint jugs and
pots that serve the same purpose as
the samovar, and if you cannot afford
to indulge your whim to the extent of
having them all. you may at least se
lect the one that pleases you the best.
Again, if you are especially given tp
novelties and like to deck yourself as
well as your home with touches of
Orientalism, the Russian costume is
Just what you are looking for. It may
be regally splendid, of heavy brocaded
satin, jeweled with glistening beads: or
it may be a peasant costume, pictur
esque and pretty; but whatever its
textures and whatever its tones, you
may rest assured that it never fails
to Â«.dd a touch of barbaric splendor to
the drawing-room of the twentieth cen
tury hostess. â¢
When Miss Guest trails gracefully
into the rofem, shakes hands and sinks
into a comfortable chair her hostess
asks her if she likes her tea strong or
weak. For each cup fs made distinct
and separate and according to the
wishes of the guests. The hostess
makos the tea with her own hands and
places the cup and saucer upon a tray,
and a maid, trim and trig in a black
gown, passes it about the room.
In one way and one only does the
American differ from the true Musco
vite fashion of drinking tea. The
American girl will drink cream in her
tea, even though she knows full well
that the Russian tea drinker considers
sliced lemon the only proper and palat
able accompaniment.
It sits on the tea table and, of course,
faces the hostess. To all appearances
It is quite dead, for there is not a sign
of gas or oil about It. as the heat 'is
produced by filling a tube, which passes
up through the urn with live charcoal.
*^-f RE you. miladi, addicted to 5
f \ o'clock teas or 4 o'clock coffees?
I I If so. be it known that your tea
I table is not complete without the
Russian and Japanese belong
ings, which have acquired such a sud
den vogue by the first rumors of war
in the J2ast, and the samovar and the
brass hot water Jug should be the
most conspicuous articles among the
tea cups and dainty plates.
The picturesque urn has been so lit
tle seen in this country that it Is
quite a charming innovation, and one
that the hostess who is searching
everywhere and at all times for novel
tics cannot afford to miss.
If you don't know what the samovar
Is. listen. It Is nothing more or less
than a brass or copper urn that Is used
in Russia. Siberia. Mongolia and a host
of Oriental places, whose only mission
on earth is to keep water boiling so
that a cup of tea may be brewed in an
Instant.

FASHIONABLE COIFFURES (Mrs.
B.)â The clever woman, fully realizing
the importance of a modish coiffure
and its relation to a perfect ensem
ble, never slights this part of her
toilet; it is only the unsophisticated or
careless woman who mars a perfect
gown by. badly arranged hair. While
elaborate effects are only possible to
the woman -who can command the ser
vices of a skilled hairdresser, every
woman can 'acquire a certain amount
of skill by persistent effort, which will
enable her to do her hair in a becoming
manner. Mind you,- I say becoming,
for this should be the keynote always
in mind; it matters little how fashion
able any particular arrangement may
be, If it is not strictly becoming to tha
individual it will trove a failure. The
only way to decidi the matter is to .ex
periment with several styles and select
the one most becoming. The low coif
fure is the latest and is very charming,
resting against a fair neck, but not
every woman can wear it successfully;
as a consequence the high coiffure and
pompadour, in modified forms,' the
waved style and others still hold secure
places, becoming as they are to the
majority of faces. Hair parted In the
middle, softly waved and puffed out at
the sides, a la Barrymore, is another
popular mode. The back may be gath
ered in a coil or puffs, a trifle below tha
crown, or in a low "coil on the neck, as
best suits the individual. To arrange
the low coiffure, comb the hair back
and tie midway' below the crown and
the neck; then loosely coll and arrange
the long strands In a figure 8, the lower
loop resting against the neck. Occa
sionally it is plaited loosely before
forming the figure 8; this mode, how
ever, is confined almost entirely to
morning wear on windy days, when a
firm adjustment is essential to neat
ness. The front hair is, of course, part
ed off from ear to ear and waved and
puffed out to becoming softness in
either case, with ends coiled around
"the ribbon which holds the> back
HEAVY EYEBROWS (Emma.) â
Do not think of having eyebrows
Â¦which meet shaved off above the nose,
for the hair would only grow
thicker and coarser. If you feel you
must have the hairs removed have it
done by electricity. However, try
careful brushing, using a small nail
brush and be sure that you do not ap
ply any oily substance to the eyebrows,
for it will promote the growth of the
hair, which you especially want to
avoid. W&
the busy woman If she will spend half
an hour dally in keeping them In con
dition and avoid needless exposure.
For . example! always wear gloves of
heavy kid when doing, any kind of
rough grimy work. If you cannot bor
row a worn pair from some mala mem
ber of your family buy a pair of un
llned dogskin gloves, such as are
bought by men; such gloves are heav
ier than those Â¦ worn by women and
will last longer. Size seven' and one
half will fit the average hand. Hou3e
keep'ers^ are constantly coming (a con
tact with dust and other things which
tend to soil the hands while they may
seem reasonably clean to the naked eye.
hence I claim that women should wash
their hands several times daily, using
plenty of soap and warm water; â¢wash
ins does not ase the hands as many
people think. Always rinse the handj
In cool water after wasning and dry
thoroughly on a soft towel. Obtain a
reliable cream, free from srease. and
apply to the hands during the day, rub
bing it in well after washing, wiping
away all surplus with a clean towel.
Before retiring cieanse the hands and
rub with cocoa butter and then du3t
freely with almond meal. Wear loose
gloves perforated at the back and
palms at night. In a month you will
observe a decided improvement.

"but you mustn't tell a soul, not even
Jack, until the evening is over."
Evening came, and with it the new
maid. As she entered the room where
Mr. and Mrs. Curtis sat Jessie said to
her husband:
"Oh, Jack. Alice was called home this
afternoon by the serious illnes of her
mother. This is Mary, who takes her
place this evening," and Jack, looking
at the dark-skinned, black-haired girl
before him, did not for a minute sus
pect she was dainty Sue Emerson.
While waiting on the guests, the new
maid gave a start at the turn the con
versation had taken.
"Well, Merritt," Curtis was saying,
"you and Sam are the only bachelors
among us to-night.'-'
"And I won't remain one for long,"
answered Merritt.
The maid was passing him salted
almonds arid, her hand shook a: trifle.
"I have "made up by. mind to ask a
certain young lady to be my wife and
she has given me reason to believe she
will not refuse.".
jj The men looked up in surprise;
. "Who is the girl?" asked Curtis.
"Miss Emerson."
The dark blue eyes of the maid
flashed as she filled the punch glasses.
"A.toac to you," a young. friend* of
Meiritt's cried. "Here's to Â¦ your trc
cess in winning Miss* Emerson." The
guests raised their glasses and drained
then\ ? 11 save Sam Congdon, whose
glass but touched' his lips. A man at
the end of the table called out: ;Â¦
"Who would have ; guessed â¢ that our
cynical friend had fallen in love." '
. "Of course I am marrying for love,"
Merritt retorted; but his \ tone w^as
tinged : with sax'casm.
Â¦ ./"You'll gef. the money along with
the love this time," some one ventured
to remark. V. Â¦
: Merritt shrugged his ? shouidt i. His
manner was near to Insolence.
The maid's hand trembled visibly as
she poured the wine. - She placed a
glass at Sam's plate, noting the pallor
of his face a3 she did so. Her blue
eyes grew darker still as Sam arose
and said:
"Won't some of you fellows drink to
me? To-morrow night at this time I'll
be on my way to Europe."
"Why, how is that?" some one asked.
A wave of color spread over Sam's
face for an instant, as he. deliberately
told the falsehood.
"}Sy father wishes me to look after
his business in Liverpool."
All drank to his prosperity. Only one
present knew the real reason for this
sudden voyage. The new maid blushed
furiously under her stained cheeks.
At 10 o'clock the following . morning
Sam stood waiting for the cab that
was to, take him to the ;wharf. His
trunk strapped and labeled stood in the
hall. His grip and umbrella were on
the table. Sam Â¦went to the dresser and
taking . from It -'a photograph, cut out
the head and shut it in the back of his
watch case. . â¢
It was the head of Sue Emerson. .He
heard the cab stop In. front of the
house, and pulling his hat down over
his eyes, he started out,' nearly falling
over a small boy in a. blue" uniform
standing In his path. A dirty, hand
passed Sam a yellow envelope.
"Sign here, sir." , .. -
Sam signed his name on the blank
indicated, tore open the envelope, read
the message and then raced down j :he
stairs. Umbrella, grip and trunk-re
mained behind. , Â¦ . . >,
. "Emerson's, Â¦ Elghty-Â£rst st," he
shouted to the driver, as he stepped
into the cab.
The : chambermaid walked into the
room just vacated by Congdon. '
"Would ye mind, these 'bits of yellow
paper flying around," she murmured' to
herself.- With" a maid's curiosity, she
put them neatly together and read:

affable and gracious as she is conscious
that she is original or individual.
Bracelets fashioned from the silver
dollars given by tourists when visiting
Alaska or 'Mexico possess a double sat
isfaction when the process of carving
with a single tool is visible "while you
wait." Fobs of metal and beadwork,
collars and chains of beads, bone and
colored silks, held together with bits of
silver uniquely chas.ed in design are
the rage.
The girl who has gone on little jaunts
basketsâ the finest and the very best
that love or money could buy.
A great brown bear reared its mighty
head from the ping-pong table and
chaining and holding it in place were
stone relics of long past ages, curious
headgear, cueer ceremonial canes and
the thousand and one symbolic bits of
handiwork of the Indian.
Miss Smith meant to turn the house
literally upside down, and she certainly
did- The basement didn't even have
a speaking acquaintance,- with itself,
for it was converted into a great wig
wam, and seated on a pile of blan
kets was a squaw making baskets as
though her very life depended upon It
and favoring the unusually persistent
with a stolid, indifferent stare that
somehew or other caused them to move
on.
Everywhere, from the attic to the
basement, did Indian treasures stare
one in the face and invite the closest
of scrutiny, so that an afternoon in
the "Indian house" would be worth a
dozen lessons in Indian lore.
Nor did she stop here. She turned
Indian herself. Really, truly Indian;
not half way. She covered her fair*
hair with a great black wig, stained
her face a dusky hue and touched it
up with red and disguised herself so
completely that her best friends had
to stop, look twice and finally wind up
by asking who it was. And so it was
with every maid that received with
her. Not one "paleface" extended a
welcoming hand nor contributed in any
way toward the fun, for amusement
there wag In plenty. There were wild
dances, weird incantations, strange
ceremonies and queer sounding gut
tural noises and songs, everywhere, in
fact, that- she had ever heard of or
that her friends knew anything about.
So It happened for once that society
was surprised. It was more, for it
was simply thunderstruck to sec the
girls forsake their dainty frocks for
the bright calicoes, the gaudy beads and
the picturesque moccasins of the red
maid. It was paralyzed to .see the im
maculate beaux leave their broadcloth
and fine linen In the closet and ven
ture forth in the buckskins of the In
dian braves. Yet they did It, and had
more fun in shelving conventionalities
than they had had In a month of Sun
days.
And the result of this unique tea
has been a sudden craze for all things
barbaric and showy. The girls dis
covered that barbaric metals were Just
the vOy. things they had been search
ing for and they straightway appro
priated all the symbolism, colors,
handiwork and material of the ab
original, so that every way one turns
these days the eye is fairly dazzled by
the primary colors and designs In
satchels, bags, cardcases, fobs, chains,
bracelets, and, forsooth, in every Im
aginable article.
The craze for bead work Is mild
compared to that of metals. Golf
sticks and other trite designs in metal
are old, the rage being for the heavy
bracelet, the tiara, comb, waist but
tons, etc., made by the Indians. Mex
ico is so near, JUEt over the border, the
routes so easily traversed, the mining
and excavating passion so intense,
that traveling is a luxury, and the
tourist, well Informed through pic
turesque official literature; digs, delves
and finds precious stones such as opals,
turquoise. â¢ perodates and rubies, and
the ever lovely matrix. In subtle
shades of green.

It wasn't from hers, however. She
sized up the situation with a critical

fully and saw no reason why it should
not be a huge success.
Therefore she promptly get to work,
and when a determined woman really
g-ets at a thing it usually means that
something is up and emphatically
doing. To be sure, she had many ad
vantages. The gTeat Smith home on
Jackson street boasted of nearly S00
rare baskets, which in themselves gave
her a big start to work on.
But that wasn't enough and she
Issued a proclamation. Not from her
housetop, to be sure, but where her
friends and her friends' friends heard
it. Baskets, blankets and all things
Indian were needed, and the great
double doors were opened wide to
receive the avalanche of barbaric
splendor that poured in.
The Persian rugs that graced the re
ception hall were carried away with a
vandal hand, and in place of the soft,
mellow colors of the Far East the
gaudy mountain blanket with its clouds
and its downpour of rain were placed
next the one that the chief of chiefs
alone is permitted to wear. The walls
were fairly lined with baskets, strung
together by a Etout invisible thread,
and even the hospitable looking fire
place was literally hidden by a multi
tude of big and little baskets, the prod
uct of every tribe of the American
Indian. The chairs, and there were a
few about, which was the only devia
tion from true wigwam fashion, were
covered with bright scarfs with soft
buckskin coats, or with fur lined
blankets; in fact, nothing was per
mitted to bear the slightest semblance
to any people save the red men.
The dining and the drawing: room
were the only ones that were not
stripped and refurnished and, forsooth,
this wasn't for lack of material, but
because of 6tern necessity.
Tea, punch and cakes were served
and no Indian of the twentieth cen
tury, especially an invited brave and
l:is sQua\v. dressed in their ceremonial
clothes, cared to squat, with knees
doubled under, true Indian fashion, for
the edification of the merry onlooker?.
Neither did they care to eat or drink
out of a common soup or head basket,
eo the pparkling cutglass and silver
retained its place and felt greatly
honored in consequence.
Bric-a-brac was carried out of the
drawing-room and Indian relics substi
tuted, but the baby grand piano's light
vaÂ« too bright to be hidden under a
bushel, and it was transformed into a
miniature curio shop.

WHEN Miss Maud Smith gave
an Indian powwow. and. what
is more, gave it with all possi
ble barbaric realism, she not
only surprised the surrounding tribes
but gave them a few valuable pointers
as well. An Indian tea was about as
far from their thoughts as the North
has kept a keen eye busy for the bar
baric artistic. She. pounces upon the
bits of handsome metal -which orna
ment the harness of the broncho or
lean pony of the Mexican Indian. These
ornaments are called "conchos," and
they come in various shapes. Some of
them are circular. These make hand
some cloak buckles when clasps ar-Â»
added by a '"civilized" jeweler. All
are artistically decorated with da
signs of the Swastika cross and other
fanciful carvings. In the center 1 of
each one is a turquoise, which looks
beautiful when set in the silver.
All these popular things will never
become common, because they are ex
pensive, nor will they go entirely out
of fashion, j
The "fair barbarian" knows . this, so
when she has an opportunity to - pick
up these things In her travels she does
so at wholesale. She often pays fabu
lous prices for genuine antiques of mili
tary origin and returns home laden
with her spoils for belt buckles, cloak
fasteners, hair ornaments, dog collars,
rings or bracelets. Thrice fortunate is
she if she can watch the silversmith
deftly hammer- the snail design on her
bracelet and belt, and s>ee him insert the
opal perodate, turquoise or 'Â¦ Arizona
ruby.
x If she desires a Swastika cross on her
ring of necklace she signifies this fact
by pantomime, whereupon the Indian
proceeds to carry out her orders. He
whips out his jackknife, a crude- affair,
and with his hammer of stone, shaped
like an egg, and about the size of a
man's fist, he skillfully "engraves" the
quaint cross which represents the four
quarters of the earth. When his task 13
completed he says to his patroness as
he presents the ornament, "May the
four winds from the four corners of
the earth blow 'gently: upon you for
ever."
Perhaps he hammers and chisels thÂ©
cross of dondee design adopted by the
ancient Franciscan monks, represent
ing the same thought. Necklaces of sil
ver beads, with six tiny crosses, at reg
ular intervals, hung upon them, and
further ornamented with a crescent
pendant were worn by the high priests,
while the chiefs necklace was adorned
with a pendant only.

Why is it. though, that the French

that the question of sanitation, of
hygiene in the household, as well as
the servant question, is beginning to
occupy the French mind. The reforms,
if they ever occur, will be -slow, for
routine here, says the Paris corre
spondent of the Brooklyn Eagle, is not
easily uprooted; a cook will never learn
to do differently from the way her
mother or grandmother did: she will
not understand that one kind of food
is more healthful than another; she
will never believe that In the "pot au
feu" boiled beef and broth, the nour
ishing ingredients all go up the chim
ney; she can never be made to believe
that brown bread contains more nour
ishment than white, that certain vege
tables are more nourishing than meat,
or that sugar Is not only put In dishes
to sweeten them, but that It contains
elements which Increase muscular
strength. In his book on "Alimenta
tion" Armand Gauthler proves that the
first notions of how to feed mankind
are ignored: but if the book were put
Into the hands of an ignorant house
keeper or cook, she would shrug her
shoulders and say. "Tout cela sont des
histoires" â all this does not mean any
thing.
IT will be of Interest to Americans
who have long been struggling
with the servant problem to hear
Those who have 6tudled the food and
its preparation in other countries are
preaching the new doctrine of having
cocking establishments In large cities,
and of having the dishes brought to
the house, as is done in Berlin: but
It will be a long time before this Is
Introduced Into French families, even
for those where every member has
some outside occupation, for after din
ner they build their fire, warm the
soup which was made early In the
morning, cook their vegetables and fry
their chop, and think this meal is much
more wholesome than any meal bought
outside or than food already: cooked In
cans. Which is right? So far statis
tics show that on an average the
French are the healthiest people and
live the longest.
As the question of servants and gen
eral cooking is one which at present is
being discussed in America, and as the
Americans look to France for the prop
er direction *of servants arid the proper
way- to live, it will not be amiss to
give the menus of the well-to-do mem
bers of the middle classes, for they
constitute In America, as well as in
Franc*;, the greater portion of the edu
cated population.
The Frenchman never loads his stom
ach In the early morning: he simply
takes a cup of coffee, chocolate or tea,
with a buttered roll, which an Ameri
can friend of mine contemptuously calls
the "LAtin breakfast," and to which
he has never become accustomed. The
hour for the second breakfast Is from
11* to r.oon. This consists of_ hors
d'oeuvres, that Is, an appetizer, such as
sardines, salted fish, radishes and other
raw vegetables: a good dish of meat,
well baked* or grilled, which Is eaten

coffee, a cigar smoked in a leisurely
fashion and a small glass of liqueur,

The experiments with paper money
are_. being continued. - and it will be
necessary to Inoculate animals with
the bacteria taken from the bills before
it can be determined whether * ; such
money .carries germs which . produce
contagious diseases. A more extended
and conclusive report on this subject
Â¦will be made when Dr. Park finishes
his investigations.

the thirty-five pennies diphtheria bacilli
were obtained from three and ml
crococci from eight. From the seven
nickel coins streptococci were obtained
from one and staphylococci from two.
From the four dimes streptococci from
one and staphylococci from one.
"This practical test demonstrates
that coins taken from diphtheria cases
and equally certainly from other In
fectious cases are liable to spread In
fection if distributed within Â¦ a few
hours after contamination.' A number
of coins ; were taken from persons suf
fering from tuberculosis and tested for
living tubercle . bacilli twenty-four
hours and forty-eight hours after re
moval. No living bacilli could be dem
onstrated."
"The persons actually sick with diph
theria and tuberculosis have not as a
rule had paper money which they had
recently, handled. Dirty bills taken,
from stores at random showed enor
mous numbers of bacteria, among
which were the staphylococci. These
occur, i not' only in septic infections, but
also in healthy skin. Thus from the
; washings . from ' one bill we obtained
135,000 " bacteria, from another 126,000.
\Two moderately dirty bills gave 2250
and 2000. respectively. Upon* all of these
staphylococci were found, but no dlpth
? therla or tubercle bacilli.
Health, and it holds a warning
against the habit of placing money in
the mouth.. It shows that while the
metal in coins possesses antiseptic
properties, infected coins may spread
disease if distributed within a few
hours after ' contamination, j The ex
periments with paper money will not
be 'completed for several weeks, but
the investigation so far has established
the fact that" paper money contains no
substance which will kill bacteria.
According to Dr. Park's report, in the
first experiment, the effect upon bac
teria of the metals In coins was tested
by covering coins with a' thin layer

OUR SERVANT PROBLEM IN PARIS
DEADLY BACTERIA ON OUR MONEY
The only drawback of this system
was that, as the campaign advanced,
the armies became clogged by large
numbers of coolies and other camp fol
lowers, who created a great deal of
trouble and committed excesses which
were wrongfully charged to the reg
ular troops. Some of the Japanese
commanders adopted a short way with
It is hardly necessary -to point out
the value of his mental attitude as a
military asset.
The Russian soldiers appear, as a
general rule, to lack the ability to
"shift for themselves" in matters of
transport and commissariat. If their
elaborate system of baggage trains
breaks down, as it may well do under
the strain of hard campaign, they are
utterly at a loss â unless they are Cos
sacks, Kalmucks or Turcomans, ac
customed from boyhood to picking up
their meals wherever and whenever
they can find them.
The Japanese, on the contrary,
showed during their war with China
a remarkable ability to create their
transport and commissariat apparently
out of nothing as they went along.
They did not trouble much about bag
gage trains; they had them, to be sure,
well supplied and well organized, but
the troops moved so quickly that they
were out of -touch with their wagons
half the time. They traveled in the
lightest possible order and picked up
any old native carts or, mules or cool
ies they chanced to meet, making them
serve the , necessities of the moment,
and then letting them go and getting
others farther on.
when his biscult3 are full or n\aggots,
when his clothes are shabby, when his
boots drop to -pieces, the Russian sol
dier," he said, "reasons it all out
slowly and can only come to' the con
clusion, so pathetic in its simple faith,
'Ah, if the Czar only knew!' Every
one within his reach he freely dis
cusses, criticizes and blames: he half
suspects that his' generals may be
fools, and he is sure that the commis
saries are rascals; but no thought of
censure ever crosses his mind against
the Czar."
"If a bridge formfng part of the
.nain line of communication of a great
army, is constructed across a large
river, _one end of it leading into a
miserable .'little' town with ' streets -so
narrow that two vehicles cannot pass,
you do riot find the lines of opposing
travel so clearly-marked that there
can be no divergence from them, and
men stationed at every corner to com
pel vehicles to take a certain direction,
but '-.you see ' two long ; lines of small
supply wagons gradually approaching
each ; other until they become jammed
and blocked Jn the middle of the town.
Several hours or, even a day or more
are occupied in unloading a half a
mile of wagons and dragging them out
backward: in order to reopen the com
munication: These are things which,
do not.. occur during the first days
or weeks, but throughout a whole
campaign of months."
These defects are, however, largely
offset by. the patient endurance of the
Russian soldier, born of his doglike
loyalty to the Czar. The American
military attache at Plevna was im
pressed by -that quality.
"When his battles result in defeats,
"If 40,000 prisoners - are suddenly
thrown on their hands, as at.the.sur
rendenof Plevna, no better expedient
presents itself than' to herd them out
In the snow In great flocks like sheep,
and let three days pass before" they get
anything to eat: .and 1 twelve days be

Ing them to the Danube, only twenty
miles offâ thi prisoners "meanwhile
perishing by hundreds . every night, s
gencies and make orderly and efficient
arrangements for the welfare ; of : an
army. The military attache ; at - the
American legation at St.: -.Petersburg
served with". the Russian . forces In the
Turkish war. He formed a very poor
opinion of the Russian officers', ca
pacity In those respects, for he wrote at
the time:
Military experts say that only a
small proportion of Russian officers
possess the ability to cope with emer-
ably in every important war waged by
Russia during the last century. The
experience of the past indicates that
the Cossacks are the only body of Rus
sian soldiers who are mobile and well
fed on a campaign. They are mobile
because they always have large num
bers of spare horses, often two for each
man; they are well fed because of" their
skill In foraging.
Russian officers spend freely out of
their private funds during a campaign
in order to remedy the defects of thej
official transport and commissariat.
They have been obliged to do so even
during maneuvers.
The example was set by Skobeleff,
Russia's - greatest genei^l of 'modern
times, during the Russo-Turkish war.
He was a rich man and every ruble
h4 owned was at the disposal of his
beloved soldiers when they needed it.
All the official arrangements for feed
ing the men and caring for the sick and
wounded broke down utterly, and
Skobeleff was always putting his hand
in his pocket through that campaign.
On one â¢ occasion he spent 15.000 rubles
to charter a steamer to take a number
of wounded men to Odessa for treat
ment. He never recovered from ths
Government the large sums he ex
pended.
Whn Skobeleff was praised to his
face for his generosity toward his
troops he replied unaffectedly:
"I owe everything to these men, and
the least I can do is to spend a few
thousand rubles to help them in thÂ»ir
need."
That spirit animates most officers in
the Russian army to-day. General
Kuropatkln, General Grodekoff and
other famous -Russian officers trained
under Skobeleff followed his example.
Now it is regarded as the regular thing
in. the Russian army for an officer to
have to spend money on his men "to
remedy official shortcomings. It is to
be feared that "praft" has a great deal
to do with those shortcomings.
The regimental trains are supple
mented by a divisional train, attached
to each division of cavalry or infan
try. Its business is to replace the regi
mental stores as they are lost or con
sumed and to transport articles of sec
ondary importance not likely to be
often or urgently required. Large
numbers of spare horses are attached
to this divisional train, as is also a
hospital section, which Is subdivided
Into a divisional ambulance and two
field hospitals.
When campaigning the Russian sol
dier is supposed to carry two days* ra
tions on his person.' The regimental
trains carry rations for each man for
two days longer, and the divisional
trains for from two to four days, ac
cording to the arm of the service to
which they are attached, less being car
ried for the artillery and infantry than
for the cavalry. It Is reckoned that
fresh supplies should always be obtain
able from the surrounding country or
along the line of communications with
in the six or eight days allowed.
The system is a good one, but it is
Impossible to forget that the transport
and commissariat broke down miser-
The "v ast extent of the Russian em
pire and the comparative scarcity of
large towns and villages in Asiatic
Russia make it necessary for the gen
eral staff to assume that, in a cam
paign, the troops will usually have
to bivouac, and will rarely be billeted
upon the civic population. According
ly, the baggage trains attached to Rus
sian forces are larger than in most
armies. An army corps of 45.V00 men
Is officially supposed to be accompan
ied bv 2400 wagons, but the number
varies, of course, with the local con
ditions and the exigencies of the situa
tion. It is usually more, for it is
difficult to reduce it if each unit of the
force is to be properly supplied.
The unit of transport is the "pol
kovye obozy," or regimental baggage
train. Each regiment has two such
trains, called the first and the second
echelons. The first train, which keeps
op with the regiment or goes ahead of
It, carries ammunition, medical sup
plies, food, the indispensable part of
the officers' baggage, and other neces-
Bary articles likely to be immediately
required. The second echelon carries
supplies not so immediately necessary,
which can be left behind well In the
rear whenever the tactics of the com
manding officer require. These sup
plies include harness, reserves of food,
technical material, movable kitchens,
religious emblems, etc.

T J mous saying that "an army
r\ crawls on its stomach." the Rus-

devolinc: the greater part of their time
and thought to the jrrcat problem of
how they are to feed their forces as
thfym-iv* them over an immense and

Theoretically the transport and com
missariat arrangements of both the
yiusria:i ami the Japanese armies are
well nigh perfect. They have won the
enthusiastic admiration of military ex
perts of many nationalities, and none
have admired them more than United
States officers. But the theory of
peace time is vastly different from the
sierr. practice of war. Theoretically,
the CJrceli transport and commissariat
were all that they should have been in
the Thessaly campaign, while the
Turkish services were all that they
thould not have been. But the world
knows how the Greek organization
broke down miserably, and how the
Turkish commanders managed some
how to feed their men arid move them
across the country from one victorious
field to another. The present war will
test conclusively the value of the Rus
sian and Japanese theories, but some
light is thrown upon them by previous
campaigns in which their armies have
engaged.
Japanese army. V/ . 4^
It would appear from recent re
ports that the food arrangements of
the Japanese forces now In the field
are excellent. According to one state
ment, each Infantry unit has a cylin
drical stove and. detachable kettle cap
able of cooking enough rice to furnish]
one meal for 100 men. Nine such
stoves and kettles are used for cook
ing for a battalion. Boxes containing 1
half-pound cans of meat are carried
by four horses for each battalion. The
question of water supply has been
carefully considered, doubtless owing:
to the fact that the sickness among
the Japanese troops in the Peking ex
pedition consisted almost entirely of
typhoid fever. Each unit carries a
quantity of sodium sulphate to purify;
the drinking water.

these obnoxious persons, driving them

soon as their services were over. After
the war it was pretty general y agreed
that no similar nuisance should be tol
erated in another campaign.
During the advance to the relief of
the besieged legations at PÂ«*lns-thÂ»
Japanese commissary was. by common
agreement of the foreign officers, bet
ter than that of any of the European
troops; and the Japanese soldiers
showed a genius for foraging and ac
commodating their appetites to the food
available In the conutry.
Instead of using heavy wagons liabla
to.be bogged or to tire out the horses,
the Japanese had a great number of
light hand carts-much like the push
carts of the Italians In New York and
other American cities. These carts .are
drawn by coolies. or by the
themselves, and they were so lightly
laden that they Interfered little, tf ai
all. with the mobility of the force. The
horse and mule carts were of the small
est type and lightly built. Spare ani
mals were made to carry their own
fodder, and that of the other animals
as well.
These measures were rendered neces
eary by the smallness and weakness or
the Japanese horses, which are about
the scrawniest animals of their kind.
The Russians, on the contrary, are well
supplied with large, strong, well-bred
horses. Horse breeding on an immense
scale was brought to a high pitch of
success in Russia by the late Count
Orloff. and the type of horse used in
the Russian army to-day is mainly
that which Is known as the Orlott
horse."
The newly broken horses of the
steppes are also used to a considerable
extent, especially by the Cossacks and
the Turkestan contingents.
In the Turcoman campaigns in Cen
tral Asia camels were employed, but
they are hardly ever used to-day by
Russian troops. Thousands of dogs are
pressed into service, however, mainly
for transporting soldiers and supplies
in sledges across Lake Baikal.
In the present campaign the Mikado's
fighting man is carrying a great deal
more food with him than his Russian
adversary-. Against the latter's two
days' rations, he carries two cooked
rations of rice in addition to six emer
gency rations. These are contained in
an aluminum mess part, and as the rice
has been boiled and dried in the sun
the entire weight is trifling.
It is commonly supposed that the
Japanese soldier lives entirely on rice
and dried fish, but such is not the
fact. He can live, and fight well, on
that spare, diet if necessary, but he
Is given meat and other sustaining
foods whenever practicable, as well as
beer or "sake." Several years ago a
military commission was appointed by
the Mikado to inquire why the phy
sique of the -Japanese troops was in
ferior to that of the British. German
and other armies. The . commission
came to the conclusion that beef and
beer helped to build ur> the stalwart
frames of Occidental fighting men,
and since then beef and. beer have

BERLIN can now lay claim to
having the most thrilling "loop
the loop" act of them all. At
any rate, it is a new feature
that is being talked about all over Eu
rope, where there are !ikely to be very
few imitators, owing to the terrible
risk of life and limb involved.
This new act is executed upon a cir
cular track, the same in every respect
as that used in the old "loop the loop"
feat, which in itself was thought to be
the very extreme of daring, with the
exception that a large section of the
track, at the top of the loop in this ln-
stance, has been removed. Thus, when
the rider comes spinning dawn the
long slope which gives his bicycle the
momentum necessary to carry it round
and up and over in a huge somer
sault it spins in the air at the top. with
absolutely nothing to guide it until it
has completed the arc and begun the
downward plunge along the remainder
of the loop. ;*;
If the momentum were not gauged to
a mathematical nicety there is abso"
lutely nothing to save the rider from
instant death, or worse, a terrible
mangling. However, the Germans are
enjoying the novel sensation to the ut
most.

Civilization and the unnatural hab

the American Medical Association Jour

ats announced by cable from Berlin, Is
for the patient to walk on all fours
for twenty minutes four times a day.
The theory on which this treatment is
based is that "certain muscles around
tne vermiform appendix are brought
intt) play and strengthened by this
quadrupedal cure, which are unused
when a biped walks erect; others are
relaxed, and the localized inflammation
has opportunity to subside." Exercise
is often beneficial, and a change of

from the duty on tobacco Greece last
year realized over half a million sterl
ing. The cultivation of .-tobacco has
been greatly stimulated and to-day
Greece produces four times as much
as she needs for her own consumption.
The leaf has ".ot got the peculiar and
delicate aroma which distinguishes the
very best Turkish, but it la quite as
good as the ordinary tobacco of Mace
donia and Albania, much of which has
long been sold in the European market.
when I lifted from a pool a plump
trout, and held him in the palm of my
hand, just on the surface of the water.
Half a dozen times I lifted the same
trout, tickling him gently on the belly
and side's. He appeared to like it, lying
over'against my, hands like a cat who
courts rubbing. I found that I could
do almost anything with the trout, car
rying them in my hand for a'few'mo
ments before returning them to the

The girls employed in the potteries
of England are good-looking and well
dressed. They have taste, which is cul
tivated by the art work of the fac
tories. Many of them are more stylish,
perhaps, than their position' seems to
warrant, but this is easily explained.
They buy their clothes by a system
known as "Maxims." This means that
twelve girls subscribe one shilling a
week. The money is held by a 'fore
woman, and when there is sufficient
cash to buy a hat or dress the girls
draw lots, and the winner has the new
dress, while the other subscribers have
to wait their turn. Then, in all the
glory of ribbons and finery, the lucky
girl appears on Sunday.

New York is pre-eminently the candy
city of the world. It has more estab
lishments engaged in its manufacture
and more stores handling it than any
city on earth. The output of England,
France and Germany is not as large
as the output of the United States; and
probably 'New York City alone pro
duces more than either of the three
countries .alone. The iron and steel
output of New York State together do
not equal in value the candy output.
The basffiCCa has assumed the propor
tions of a giant among the manufac
turing industries.

Those expert in '"matters of food
values opine that celery has more po
tency than any drug in the world for
producing bright eyes and a clear com
plexion. It must be eaten raw. It is
not only a beaUtifier but promotes
health in various ways and inspires
energy, good temper and nerve-poise.
London greengrocers have' been sur
prised at the increasing _ demand . for
celery. The explanation is that a large
coterie of smart and pretty women, to
gether with' an equally large-section
not so conspicuous . for their pulchri
tude, have created a. celery beauty

; "Cenesthesla" is the' name given to
the general feeling we have of the ex
istence of our own bodies. This sense
of existence'- is chiefly owing, to acci
dental and local Impressions awaken
ing or stimulating the . sensibility, but
it "is completed by ; a certain ; : obverse
consciousness of the exercise ' of or
ganic functions â for . example, respira
tion. It is' by this sensation that the
spiritual Ego perceives itself existing
locally in the llmitedi'exte.nt of ; the or
ganism. In perfect health this feel
ing Is continuous, uniform and equal/
and, therefore, not. special or local. In
order to be remarked.a/certain exalta
tion of well being or' distinct uneasi
ness Is* required. In the hyphdtlc state
certain subjects have a more or less
distinct perception of their internal or
gans and can exert certain action over
them. In fact they can modify at will
all the functions of the^ "vegetative"
lifeâ for instance, the ! beating' of'* the"
serted,' the fruit ripening as though it
had never been disturbed from the
original^ place of growth. This method
seems to open up a wide field, as well
from the scientific as from the practical
point of view. It is easy to see all the
advantage that could be derived from
the method for the purpose of.trans
porting fruits, from trees too heavily
loaded, to those which have few fruits
upon them. . . .
Half covered with postage : stamps,

Far more famous was John Elphin
son, who rose to bo a rear admiral In
the Russian navy. His elderly son be
came a captain in the same navy and
the second In that of the United States.
Under Elphinson, another famous
Russo-Scot served In the person of Sir
Samuel Grcig, son of a ship owner in
Flfeshire. Greig entered the Russian
navy in 1764. under Admiral Elphin
son's command, and did wonders in
remodeling: the discipline and educat
ing the officers. When he died, in 1788,
he was given a state funeral. His son,
Alexis Samullvich, became an admiral
in the Russian fleet. It was a Scot
named Mackenzie who first called at
tention to the strategic possibilities of
Sebastopol. The hand the Scots took
in the Crimean war has been immor
talized in poetry.
The F.ussian navy has practically
been made by Scots. One of the least
known of those was Admiral Sir Thom
as Gordon. Governor of Kronstadt. The
Jacobites cf 1713 tried to Induce -him
to advise the Crar to send a Russian
fleet down the Scotch coast. â¢>

Â¦ Many Improvements have been made
in Lord Kelvin's - compass and sound
ing machine, /acording to reports re
ceived . at the State Department. In
the newest form of the compass the
illumination is effected from below
and either oil lamps or electric light
may be used. The bottom of the com
pass bowl is in the form of a strong,
thick lens, through which the light is
refracted on the card.'
The intensity of the light may be
varied at the pleasure of the observer,
and this is found to be exceedingly
useful in taking the bearing of stars
or other faint lights. A new* antl
vibrational: suspension has been de
signed, which Insures great steadiness
in the card, and a new form of helmet,
with -.rifle, sights, facilitates the work
of taking bearings.
With. the new ; helmet navigators are
able, to take bearings of lights and
stars by night with the same ease and
convenience as bearings of ; the sun
are now taken by day.
The new. form of sounding machine
has been constructed of a height which
has been found from "practical experi
ence to'be the most suitable for the
work of winding In the line. In addi
tion to \ this great . advantage the new
machine^ has an improved . form" of
brake. action and a further advantage
Is that the working -parts of : the ma
chine are all In sight and can be easily
removed If necessary.

From her dress it might be imagined
that Mme. ~ Dieulafoy has advanced
Ideas in feminism. Yet she clings to
old-school nations that woman's chief
superiority, resides precisely in the "al
leged inferiority of her home position.
When the writers Paul and Victor
Marguerltte opened, a campaign In
favor of . divorce by. the consent of
either party, which would make mar
riage scarcely even;a formality, Mme.
Dieulafoy bravely 'took up the cudgels,
not^ against woman's: right, but, as she
considered, for", them.. '"You claim that
women are the slaves of marriage, and
that they would proflt;by. this new ar

story which has not been told In print.
King Edward is scrupulously observ

religious matters as compared with
purely worldly affairsâ horse racing, for
instance.* As every one knows, Queen
Victoria, was all the other way. Dur

chapel" in Buckingham Palace received
careful attention and everything neces

Accustomed as she is to hardship and
privation when on her explorations,
Mme. Dieulafoy leads a life almost as
Spartan when at home. Her residence
in the Rue Chardin is one of the finest
and most luxuriously furnished in
Paris; but most of her time is passed
in a room on the fourth floor at the
rear, far from the noise of the street,
overlooking the gardens of the Tro
cadero. Books covering the walls from
floor to celling; a few rugs, a chair or
two; a large desk, to "the; left and a

Another subject which has since oc

Andalusia. It has been considered that
this subject was exhausted, but Mme.
Dieulafoy found that many of the most
perfect specimens of art were guarded
jealously in the cathedrals and were
known to the chapters and to the royal
family alone. Having made many pow
erful friends during her long and pa
tient researches in Spain, and being a
member of the Spanish Academy, Mme.

fty's own studies had convinced her
that Oriental art had not sprung from
Arabia, as was generally supposed. She
devoted fifteen years to solving this
problem, examining every trace of Ori
ental art and architecture in Spain,
in Algeria, in Morocco, in Egypt, and
thence farther East, tracing its course
step by step. Finally, on the site of
BaLylon, she found the origin which
she had been seeking, and turning back,
followed its path as it had advanced
round the shores of the Mediterranean,
passing through Lower Egypt, Morocco
and Algeria, then crossing the Straits
of Gibraltar, and reaching its last ex
pression at Granada. Never before had
this course been traced; and only since
Mme. Dicu'.afoy's investigations have
been known has the world of science
and of history known how to account
for the Oriental arts.

Probably,. it will be some time before

dawn, for the game is now indulged in

LONDON. April 9.â It Is no longer
considered smart for society women to
carry their toy dogs about with them
either In their arms or In carriages.
Queen Alexandra, in spite of the fact
that she is a well-known lover of dogs,
is responsible for the new departure.
It was, until recently, a common thing
for ladies to carry their pets with them
on the occasion of invitations to lunch
eon and dinners. To fondle a pet while
out driving was considered the right
thing, and her Majesty herself always
had one or two of her favorites with
her when walking or driving In the
neighborhood of the palaces. The re
cent royal gathering at Chatsworth.
the Duke of Devonshire's place in
Derbyshire, brought together, however,
such a number of lap dogs that her
Majesty felt that the craze was becom
ing too monotonous and she decided
there and then to set an example that
would kill it. She ordered one of the
royal footmen to take her own two tiny
pets back to London immediately and
the remainder of the ladies present took
the tip. Drives out after that were no
longer graced by the presence of the
lap dog. The London clubs followed
suit and now dogs are excluded from
them all. It is feared among fanciers
and breeders that her Majesty's action
will seriously interfere with their occu
pation.
Her Majesty's Example
Becomes Law of
Socletu.
The question of dress is one of the
many little details of life regulated
by French law, and the man caught in
the etreets wearing woman's clothes
or the woman in man's clothes is
promptly arrested, tried and fined. This
does not mean that such cases are ex
ceptional; indeed, there are in Paris
many women wearing men's clothes,
not as an habitual thing, perhaps, but
on frequent occasions, either as a Joke
or from convenience, or. some of the
fair sex allege, to avoid too much at
tention from men. Yet there* is always
Â£ risk of scandal involved in such ln
ciancts. and any one making a fixed
practice of outwardly changing sexes
had better faee the difficulties in the
wray and secure a license if possible.
Exceptions are sometimes necessary
with paternal governments which are
supposed to oversee everything.
Â¦ Some of the laws on dress are hard
and fast, for instance, one connected
with the Mardi Gras and Mid-Lenten
festivities. On those days all varieties
of fancy dress are sanctioned, so long
as one's reserve is maintained; men
may masquerade as women, or vice
versa, but woe betide the wretched be
ing who presumes to appear in tights.
For this lart offense there is no escape
after commission, and no license to be
bought beforehand. With the mere
question of man's or woman's clothes,
however, more leniency is shown, and
in exceptional casefc and upon presen
tation of conclusive reasons therefor, a
woman may habitually wear men's
clothes or even a man woman's clothes.
Rosa Bonheur received one of these
rare permits, because she could not, she
said, go about freely sketching in the
fields when hampered by skirts. And
Mme. Dieulafoy received another on
account of her archaeological re
searches, which the still continues in
termittently in other places. Yet
But when she was finally ready to
return to her Paris home, she lacked
the courage to resume what she had
come to consider as the slavery of
woman's dress. To face public criti
cism was far less trying an ordeal.
For five years she had dressed as a
man. and to dress as a woman seemed
as antiquated and absurd to her as it
would be for a New York stockbroker
to parade Wall street in a Roman toga.
And she, therefore, filed a formal pe
tition to the French Government ask
ing official authorization to wear men's
clothes in future.
dresses as a max.
Perhaps what causes Mme. Dieulafoy
to be often taken for a man by those
who do not know her is that she wears
her masculine garb without cither af
fectation or false modesty. She wears
men's clothes not only because she con
siders them rational and convenient,
but because she is thoroughly accus
tomed to wearing them, and acquired
the habit in exceptional circumstances.
Consequently short hair and ties and
coats and trousers seem quite nat
ural to her. because she/ is perfectly at
case with them.
The first time that Mine. Dieulafoy

Intending to renounce feminine gar
ments forever. In 1881 the French
Government had intrusted Marcel
Dieulafov with an important archaeo
logical mission to Persia and Susiana,
and Mme. Dieulafoy, whose tastes were
literary and -who has always taken
keen interest in archaeological ques
tions, decided to follow her husband.
The results of their joint labors were
to be of'Trfestimabre" Value fo 'lovers
of the antique, for they found the cites
of the palaces of Darius and of Arta
xerxes. and after five years of toil
brought the principal vestiges back to
the Louvre Museum in Paris. The work
was filled with fatigues, difficulties and
danrers. and Mme. Dieulafoy, after
tearing her skirts on prehistoric stones
and tripping over her petticoats in
Persian fields, decided that woman's
dress was not devised for archaeologi
cal pursuits. She envied the ease and
immunity with which her hsuband
rcoved about, and presently it occur
red to her that if she imitated him in
the wilds of the Orient no one would
be the wiser when she returned to
Paris. So one fine day, not suspect
ing that she was preparing a great
decision in life, she cut her hair,
donned a suit of man's clothes and
went to her work. For the first time
she was free and happy, and accom
plished so much, that she decided -to
continue dressing as a man so long
as the remained in Persia.

Each train was provided with regula

The first *~***n sent out by the dis

Eastern Stamps. The first train headed
for China, which was located in an
apartment-house on Sacramento street,
near Larkin, and to this the passengers
rode on shank's mare, accompanied by
the train boys Felling their wares. As
the passengers who did not know the
points of destination, but were out for
a good time and sightseeing, enlivened
the trip by blowing fish horns and Bet
ting the people along the route to
thinking that New Tear had come in
ahead of time. The several train loads
were welcomed by Josiah E. Locke and
shown to the apartments of Dr. Cath
rine Dall Knueolls, which were ar
ranged as a Chinese temple with a joss,
punk, and there was Chinese music fur
nished by two genuine heathen Chinee.

robes. Dr. Knueolls, the hostess, was

dressed with fish glue and decorated
with tinsel and flowers. After the pas

they returned to the train to make
room for the others; the train then
moved to the residence of Mrs. George
Hass on Ellis street, near Lar
kin, where the passengers saw

Fonted by Miss Beatrice Kelly. In
this place the spacious parlors were
turned into a German home with a bur
gomeister smoking a long pipe while
extending the hand of friendship to the
tourists and telling them "ihr sind wll
kommen." For the entertainment of
the visitors there were songs by young
ladies attired as German peasants, and
there was a peasant dance by four
ladies and the same number of gentle
men in the costume of Hei
delberg, under the direction of
Mrs. Strombonl. who spent sev
eral days teaching them the * dance.
From Germany the tourists went to
Dixie Land, in the apartments of Mrs,
Charles Swazey, in the Strathmore,
which were gorgeously decorated in Im
itation of a Southern forest, embel
lished with American flags. There the
tourists were treated to old and new
negro melodies by members of the
chapter, whose identity was concealed
by the use of burned cork. From there
they were conducted to Egypt in one
of the parlors of Golden Gate Hall,
where MIes Daisy Pabst "was the'hos

representatives of the Oriental races,
who told them their fortunes for the

a?ent, with a regulation ticket printed
after the manner of first-class detach
able coupon tickets, which was good
for a trip from the Union depot to
China, from China to Germany, from
Germany to Dixie i^ani and from Dixie
Land to Egypt. Each ticket was punch
ed at identification marks, and had to
bear the signature of the holder. These

' I think madame here good-humoredly
doubted my taste, but she told me
proudly that President Roosevelt had
presented Franz George Washington
with a silver mug last year, with "From
Theodore Roosevelt to Franz George
Washington Schumann-Helnk on his
third birthday" inscribed thereupon.
Schumann-Heink's ardent American
ism is not her least notable trait. She
is frankly, ardently grateful to the
country that,' for her magnificent ser
vice in song, has given her the means
to bring up Franz George Washington
and the rest in the way they should go.
She evidences it in the fearless and
comical fashion that made Ernestine
Roassler's father's (Major Roessler) life
a very lively one, until the now Schu
mann-Heink's superabundant energies
were afforded outlet on the stage. "I

the pictures, please, Josie." And as
Miss Hartman delivered about a yard
and a half of handsome Schumann-
Heinks into my hands, madame
laughed: "The New York Herald al
ways wants my children, too, and many
other papers. This is, you know, Franz
â¢Jeorge Washington, and this Maria
Theresaâ" and so on through the
whole bonny double quartet of them.
"They're beauties," I said critically,
"but wait until Maria Theresa sings
O'trud like her mother. It's you we
want to-day."
Pretty, madame is not. I thought as
I looked at her there, posing in large
unembarrassment. But then she looks
pretty! There is a pair of scintillant
brown eyes, humorously cut off at the
lids, and with the clear, blue whites of
a child; cheeks of lively rose under a
t lear, warm tan; fine brown hair,
with health in every thread of its
gloss and wave, and a smile irresistible
in its radiant good humor, kindliness
and bubbling fun, to make her. And as
I looked at her. like a German Ceres
in her deep-bosomed, ample-shouldered
prime, I thought there was no beauty
like that of perfect health, and

Then stepping back, this incor

Fight children and an artist of the
first magnitude â no, I should have no
need to fear nerves and things from
St humann-Helnk. I had asked for a
chat on the morning of her first con
cert and spent perhaps a moment won
dering if the singer would dole out her
words by the precious dozen, in a
grudging pianissimo. Then I remem
bered Franz George Washington Schu
n?ann-Heink and Maria Theresa Schu
mann-Heink and Heinrich Schumann-
Hrink and the five other little Schu
mann-Hrinks, with their eighty little
fingers to wash, to "kiss better," to
krop out of mischief, to find work and
play and bread for and I knew better.
And so large a family to pray for, too,
as madame seriously put it.
She came to meet me then as I felt
fhe must, with a full-blooded grasp of
â¢.he hand, a "how-de-do" like an organ
note and a smile as sunny as the
morning outside. It was at her hotel,
in a general sumptuousness of " set
tingâvelvet green mostly, beginning
with a carpet lush as an April lawn.
There were several other feet on it be
pjd^s mine and madame's. In fact I in
terrupted a very kaffee-klatsch of
"Ichs," *'dus" and "ach himmels" as I
went in. Madame's accompanist, Miss
Hartman, who also guides madame's
naive and courageous English in the
way it should gx>, was there, other
friends, and a gifted young woman
with a 'voic* that she had brought
fur the singer's criticism. Less
us<h! to an audience than Schu
mann-Heink, I asked, after the
"fruten morjrens," if she minded chat
ting before people. If she didn't I
didn t.
Â¦
"Ich!" *he laughed and lifted her
"And," she said soberly, "I work and
work and work for nothing for twenty
years. Then I come to America â all
happy!"
"Madame, I cannot understand how
you could remain so long unrecog
nized," I exclaimed then. The tardy
recognition of this glorious singer in
her own country has long been a source
of profound amazement to me.
She explains it with a droll malice,
intensely amusing.
"You see," she laughed. "I not prima
donna. No tea-ea-ea gowns," and her
fingers haughtily swept, an imagined
train into space, then critically slapped
her taut walking skirt and trim lawn
waist. "I not beautiful."
"Not beautiful, Madame, but â '"
"Ach! with this!" she smiled, and
sayly pushing her perhaps not classical
nose into an appalling retrousse.
I was helpless by this time, but she
went on: "And I married very young,
have many children, no diamonds, not
at all interesting, I," she summed up
with a droll mischief that completed
the collapse of the company generally.
Space will not hold to tell how she
acted out the whole comedy, more's the
Pity.
I recovered at length to aski "How
could you keep out of comic opera eo
long?" .
"I have not," the singer returned. "I
have much Bung in comic opera at
home. In Germany one will sing funny
parts, too. Not triviale music, zo."
"Butâ"
"Ob, yes," madame conceded to my,
"A long time, isn't it?"
"The same great as Kundry. I learn
eo much from her," the prima donna
acknowledged, as gratefully as heartily.
"From Nordica, too, and Sembrlch, and
Melba, ail of them. I listen so much."
"What Is your opinion of the effect
of Wagnerian opera on the voice,
madame?"
She looked to see if I were serious,
and finding a glint of comprehension
in my nearest eye, replied with an an
swering gleam: "Ach, you know. When
you can sing, Wagner is all right. One
must have the Italian wayâ as it is
calledâ at the beginning. You cannot
fix building without first groundâ"
"Foundation, madame," from Miss
Hartman.
I â¢â¢ 'Foundation' it is," madame grate
fully repeated. "But the young singer
begins with Isolde, Kundry, Elsaâ she
cannot sing them. Voice goes, poor
Richard is blamed. I sing now twenty
five years and have better voice now
than before."
"Ach! there i. artist!" her confrere
exclaimed. "It is not freundechaft,
but I think Ternina most wonderful
artist of Wagner that is. She has
voice like^this" â measuring off a lit
tle inch of her little finger â "but art!
Her Kundry" â and madame jumped
up to act it â "when she sings of Jesus
Christus, of looking for the wonder
ful eyes of him she has seen (ma
dame's took on the ecstatic rapture pf
Kundry's) that cry when she sees
him! Ach! There is nothing like it.
It is above the earth. It makes chills
run down the back zo!" and madame's
plump finger ran firmly down my own
sympathetic spine.
"Her Isolde Is also very great?"
"I think, I feel, not right," madame
returned, shaking her head. "How
you think?' Richard Wagner asked,
as last wish, that it be given only at
Bayreuth. 'Parsifal* needs surround
ings. You know it is not best work
of der meister and can only be â what
is vollkommen, Josie?â effective in
Bayreuth." . *}
"I thought the Metropolitan produc
tion was technically perfect?"
"Not alone is it that," madame de
cided, "it is the little village, among
beautiful hills, the atmosphere and
reverence of Bayreuth, that helo it.
After first act you have one hour in
termission. You eo out in 'the village,
get new life '- your feelings, and
come back with impression of God's
own earth about you."
"I should have imagined you would
lose the atmosphere that way."
"Nicht wahr, not at all." the singer
decided. She reverted then: "In New
York it was good 'Parsifal' this year.
But if in one, two year they give it
poor cast? â people say, 'Oh "Parsi
fal!" What is "Parsifal?"*" this with
a shrug that sent the "Parsifal" into
unknown limbos of degradation. It is
perhaps just as well that Schumann-
Heinck did not sr2 our local edition.
"Ternina was the Kundry this
year," I remarked.
"By the way, how do you feel about
the Conried 'Parsifal,' madame?" I
queried.
"Ach! how beautiful!" she cried.
Then looking out of the open window
upon the city, lifting fairly under the
milky topaz of the morning sun, her
bright face suddenly sober in the
silken kiss of the little spring wind,
madame said: "Never had I. Easter
time like this! I came, last week,
through your mountains. Mein Gott,
how beautiful! My heart was bo .big"
â her arms stretched to their furthest â
"I cried like a child. You know "Par

much prayer for eight children â das*

"Hoist it, madame"â politely, from
Miss Hartman.
"What should I without you do,
Josie? â hoise it on July 4th, George
Washington's birthday, all American
holidays. Some neighbors say," she
laughed, then drew down her mouth at
a tremendously disapproving angle,
"what's de matter mit her! Jalouse!
But I lofe America."
"And California, madame."
From the seriousness of "A Doll's
House" .to the lovely picture book of
"Mam'selle Napoleon" is a far step. Yet
is "Mam'selle Napoleon" for the people
who like the kind of thing, best worth
seeing of its kind. Ziegfeld, who pre
sents the piece, has outdone himself in
the lavish beauty of the costumes and
scenic investiture. There are costume3
innumerable, from their quaint and
correct beauty, their admirable splen
dor, alone worth going to see. Zieg
feld is an artist of the first rank here,
of a fine eye and ungrudging purse.
Not less may be said of the just mag- Â¦
niflcence of the scenic settingsâ the
Artists' Foyer at the Comedie Fran
caise with its gallery of portraits, thÂ«
Kiosk at Compiegne", with its lily
starred lake, the Grand Opera-house
with a ball in progress, a scene of al
most unexampled splendor. Of course
there are pretty girls galore, the pret
tiest still the dimpled and bewitching
Billy Norton. What a sonsie, bonny
creature she is, in that rustic white
satin gown of the second act, with
the gloriously illogical chapeau of the
period! The lighting, too, Is a fea
ture of the production in which , Mr.
Ziegfeld has points galore for hla
rivals.
Of the comedy one finds "Mam'selle
Napoleon" with moments of unexpected
seriousness. M. Richepin, who is its
Parisian progenitor, furnished the play
with a pretty little plot that has not
wholly disappeared under its ' expert
editing for the American market at
Joseph Herbert's hands. And Herbert
has added a whole arsenal of jokes and
popular ditties and generally brought
the comedy within what M. Richepin
would doubtless call the coarser Amer
ican comprehension.
As Mile. Mars, Anna Held has an
unusually varied opportunity and dis
plays unsuspected resource therein.
She looks tinier than ever among her
regiment of stalwart maids, and as
ever is the acme of serpentine ele
gance and seductive prettiness. She
has moments in the second act, where,
as Mile. Mars, she meets Napoleon to
plead for her. lover's life, and to refuse
at the same time Napoleon's devoirs,
that make one : soundly regret the un
deniable suggestion of her "Same Old
Girl," for- example. Mile. Held does
not need to depend upon that kind;of
thing. The little scene with Napoleon
showed her a â¢ bewitching and dainty
little artist, the climax reached in her
entirely delightful reÂ£ltal, in delightful
French, of "The Lion and the Mouse."
In the first act also she did some nota

"A Doll's House" will, however, in

triumphant, biting realism of "Hedda

Mrs. â¢ Fiske's very personality was

chic, spirituelle, elegant, that faced me.
"Of course we can't," she laughed.
"Let's talk Sardou."
She told me then that Harrison Grey
Fiske, the worthily famed editor of the
famous Dramatic Mirror, and the for
tunate husband of his distinguished
wife, had made this translation of "Di
vorcons" in three days, and never even
read it over. A brilliant feat! As the
highest compliment in my power, I
told Mrs. Fiske that I should like to in
terview him.
But we left Ibsen severely alone.
I went behind then, to see Mrs. Fiske
with her young girl coiffure, the dress,
the saucy face of Cyprienne. and I gave
it up.
"I wanted you to tell me a little
about Nora Helmer," I said, but â "
"But?"â
"But" â
That was before the "Divorcons,"
before an hour and a half of Sardou at
his best. I watched the performance
through with, the same, or increased,
lively delight with which I had seen it
on Monday night. The delicacy of touch,
quick, light, sure, the admirable wit of
the fooling-, the wholly French key and
rhythm of the performance, from Mrs.
Fiske's Cyprienne to Mack's waiter,
anew surprised and charmed me. The
gayety and insolence of the whole thing,
in fact, intoxicated me afresh, and I'm
afraid I had quite forgotten grim, oM

As "A Doll's House" leads the dra

much for youthful sincerity. It's the

On Tuesday evening the reception at
Century Hall, given to the charming
new rector of Grace Church, the: Rev.'
David' Evans, proved a very pleasant
affair. Receptions to divines are oft
times sepulchral functions, but the
Tuesday reception proved the- excep
tion, owing perhaps to the personality
of the honored guest, which is unde
niably pleasant.
A coy little bride was Miss Eleanor
Eckart, who now signs h'er name Mrs.
Edward C. Hume. Hers was a Mon
day wedding, and a noteworthy one.
The Eckart home on Clay street was
redolent with the blossoms of spring,
and the scene will linger long in the
memories of the fifty friends bidden
to witness the ceremony.
Mr. Hume is a popular U. C, man
of *94 and a member of the D. K. E.'s â
in which no doubt his little bride will
become a silent partner.
A pretty pair of maids attended the
bride at I the "altar. Miss Georgie Spie
ker and Miss Mabel Donaldson, the lat
ter herself to become a bride ere long.
Some stunning gowns and- bonnets
were worn, which drew forth much ad
miration from some Easterners loiter
ing in the lobby.
The hostess was assisted in receiving
by Miss Evelyn Hussey and Miss Car
ma Suttcn of Oakland and Miss Mabel
Watkins and Miss Florence Yates of
San Francisco. Fruit blossoms and
Easter Hlies made an attractive back
ground for the function.
Tuesday was prolific of affairs.
There was the card party at the St.
Francis â quite the largest affair of the
week â given by Mrs. Clarence J. Wet
more of Oakland.
That was truly a brilliant assem
blage. Lovely women and brave men
â in warrior garb â made an effective
background for the dazzling bridal
party.
At the reception that followed at the
Kent home these guests sat with the
bridal party:
Mrs. Malcolm Graham, Miss Kath
leen Kent, Miss Florence Cole. Miss
Jane Wilshire, Miss Mattie Milton. Miss
Louise Hall, Captain Enochs, Captain
Bradford. Dr. Brieshman, Lieutenant
Shinkle and Lieutenant Wetherill.
Florence Nightingale, Miss- Florence
White, Miss Marion Goodfellow. â¢Miss
May Coogan, Miss Mary Backer and
Miss Carolyn Oliver, made a group of
pretty maidens, and prettily f rocked
they were, too, all in white.
Who will forget Mrs. Ernest Stent in
her wedding robe of Venetian lace, with
her wealth of Titian hair done in quaint
fashion, and bearing queerish orchids?
A renaissance picture in truth!
Then there was the glinting, clank
ing invasion of Grace Church by the
soldiery, to commemorate m fitting
fashion the wedding of Miss Ethel Kent
to Lieutenant Gilbert A. Allen.
Whart a lovely bride she was as she
turned from the priedieu to receive the
greetings of loving friends.'

The Miller-Burdge wedding was a
charming affair â artistic, without os
tentation, and picturesque. The deco
rations have not lieen surpassed these
many moons, the Smith mansion lend
ing itself admirably to the plans of
th<- artists.
What a week for nuptials! On Mon
day, the Burdge-MUler affair took
place; on Tuesday Miss Catherine
Louise Hamlet became the bride of
William A. Boole; on Wednesday the
Stent-Harris and the Allen-Kent nup
tials occurred. Now, that's a pretty
fair start for the first week of Lenten
respite.
Ab to future functions, they are al
most innumerable.
It is t>aid that the Mohr-Bailey wed
ding will occur in June, to the pretty
accompaniment of midsummer roses.

May the salon prosper! Let us face
Gertrude's accusation with the contra
dictory evidence of the mental and
moral growth of our society' folk in
the formation of that salonâ or many
vt them.
So our compatriot. G< -trade Atherton.
eeply deplores the degeneracy of *o
ictyânot California society parttcu
arly, but the whole civilized product.
\'ov\. that's distinctly sad. But* luck
ly. there are those who don't believe
tâ not a word of it. That there are de
?pnpr. :s in society every sane creature
admitsâ Just as there are misfits "out"
of the elysium known generieally as
society, course â¢ all harbor in
our minds the tale of "The Daughter
of the Vine" â a disclosing of the his
tory of an old California family; so
It is logical to suppose that we of the
West come under the ban â therefore are
we grieving. Witness e tears!
Hi .-.ever, seriously speaking, there la
ground for much that Gertrude saysâ
of the frivolity, the lack of purpose,
ard the resultant inanity of many who
compose the leisure class. But what of
the larger and still crowing classâ the
Â¦women who do things, be the things
cultural, philanthropic or merely so
cialâherein, of course, eliminating the
antics of our forest ancestry?
Whatever may be said of the bulk
of European society, there is no ques
tion that society in America â which we
know is dominated by womenâ is seri
ously occupied a part of its time with
mental culture, with charities or work
along social science lines. In New
York, in Chicago and in San Francisco
âobserve the three cities of these great
United Statesâ there are not a baker's
dozen of women .who are not devoted to
some cultural cl^b or some hospital or
home. It is said that women play
c#ds for high stakes, that they go to
their couches addle-pated, that they
svfar and smoke â and go to any
knpths to pet the money for the clothes
thdr station imposes upon them. Now,
of our own local set, how many could
be tallied en any such footing?
True, there are a few who do not
possess the attributes that we fondly
hope to find among the sni^rt set, but
they are few â happily a very few. And
as for the tender care society maids
and matrons bear the heavy-laden,
look at the roster for philanthropic
work <>f the last fortnight â or, if you
be of the sex with side pockets you
perhaps know more about that than I
can tell you. But distinctly, are the
women of San Francisco society ac
quitted of the charge of frivolity â that
is, the bulk of it, and the part that
counts. Ar.d as to lack of purpose,
why. haven't we had Darragh giving
us Shakespeare, and Mrs. Fiske Ibsen?
Then our social leaders number
among them enough musicians â prac
tical and theoretical â to make two
very reputable musical clubs, the
Twentieth Cenvury and the San Fran
cisco â both of which present high
class programmes and promote a taste
for good music.
Among the clubs doing work along
cultural lints the Spinners' hold a con
spicuous place, composed of women
who do things â who write, paint, sing,
play or do something worth while. The
president of this interesting organiza
tion. Miss Ednah Robinson, has just
promulgated a scheme for the redemp
tion of our social iniquities and inani
ties â the establishment of the salon in
our city, even as in Parisâ yes, and in
New York â where clever people may
meet their kind, and drink from a com
mon fount the inspiration that means
development â and mutual pleasure.

he called their son, who was playing,
into the house and coaxed him into the

he related the awful details without a

Chief Armstrong told him, "he lacked

. The press learns that the exact status

; After; King Edward: had given ; his
personal 'assurances to Emperor Nich
olas, that- the anti-Russian comments
in the 1 British press did Jnof represent

; Great Britain, thanks to Lord Lans

ANGLO-RUSSIAN OVERTURES.
PARIS, April 9.â Although the
Anglo-French colonial treaty just
sighed "makes no, specific reference to
any protectorates, it Is now recognized
that between the lines the treaty
means the establishment, of a French
protectorate v over i Morocco similar to
the ,. present â¢ protectorate of France
over -Tunis, ami that it makes perma
nent' the ' British . protectorate over
Egypt.! Thus the effect of the treaty
is to transform the entire political
geography "of â¢ Northern Africa, with
Great Britain dominating the eastern
shoves of the Mediterranean and
France the western shores.
LONDON, April 0.â The Anglo-
French colonial treaty marks the cul
minating point of Lord Lansdowne's
recovery from the injury done his repu
tation by the South African war, and
crowns a notable series of diplomatic
acts, which raises Lord Salisbury's suc
cessor to the first rank of British For
eign Secretaries. ;ISSI
Lord Lansdowne's quality as a" diplo
matist was first manifested when he
refused to follow, the lead of Chamber
lain and other Ministers in abusing the
Boers and reviling their leaders and
initiated the courteous methods which
transferred the final stages of the
South African problem from the sphere
of. violence to the sphere of reason.
Then followed a policy of firm and
definite opposition to Russia in Asia
and Europe. In this respect Lord Lans
downe stands almost alone among lat
ter-day ;BritIsh statesmen.
V His outspokenness has startled many
responsible personages in. London and
amazed the. statesmen of St v Peters
burg, where the tradition prevails that,
however, much Great Britain may pro
test, it has no intention of seriously at
tempting to arrest Russia's advance
when; Russia is actually ready to move
forward. . .

BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY. WHO
NEGOTIATED COLONIAL TREATY
WITH FRENCH GOVERNMENT.
Diplomats accredited to the Court of
St. James express surprise at the fact
that Lord Lansdowne has gone even
so far as she has. It was believed, es
pecially in German quarters, that the
suggested negotiations lived only in the
Imagination of. the press and that the
authorities at St. Petersburg and Lon
don tacitly sanctioned the fallacy in
thethope of reconciling the British and
Russian publics.
That Lord Lansdowne has taken such
an initiative while Great Britain's ally
is still at war with Russia is regarded
as being a somewhat bold and unex
pected step, all the more so because it
Is understood here that all' the Rus
sians at St. Petersburg still studiously
avoid visiting the British embassy. One
of the members of the diplomatic corps
here, on learning what Lord Lans
downe-had done, said:
"That is an olive branch with a
vengeance."

ity, of the exclusion law of 1902, in* view
of : the denunciation of the treaty, and
he. will prepare and submit to the Pres
ident an opinion on the subject- Both
the President and the Attorney General
have discussed the matter with mem
bers of Congress. It is being consider
ed, too, by members of both branche3
of Congress, and if it is deemed neces
sary some legislative action will be
taken on it before adjournment. If it
should be concluded that the denun
ciation of the treaty by China would
render inoperative existing laws re
garding Chinese exclusion, the proba
ble course of action will be to attach
to one of the pending appropriation
bills an amendment enforcing the ex
clusion of Chinese.
Members of Congress generally are
agreed that no difficulty will be experi
enced in passing. the legislation if it
should be regarded as necessary.
No great hope was felt here that they
could ever reach a conclusion satis
factory to both countries, though in
view of the Anglo-French agreement
even the most pessimistic are unwill
ing to be too dogmatic on this point.
Both King Edward's personal action
and the step taken by his Foreign Sec

DIPLOMATS ARE ASTOUNDED.
However, it is positively stated that
the Exclusion laws will continue to be
enforced after December next, whether
the treaty expires or not.
WASHINGTON, April 9.â In the Cab
inet meetings and in conferences "di
rectly between the executive heads of
departments the whole subject of the
status of the Chinese immigration
question as it will' be afjer the lapse
of the existing treaty has been thor
oughly digested, and it can be stated
that the administration feels that it
has ample warrant for continuing .to
enforce the rigid provisions of the Chi
nese exclusion act, regardless of the
denunciation of the treaty.
So far from opening the door to Chi
nese immigraton the lapse of the
treaty will, it is said, actually render
the entrance of- Chinese into this coun
try more difficult than while the treaty
remained in force. This fact has been
pointed out to the Chinese Government
by Minister Conger, who has not yet
abandoned the effort to induce the Chi
nese Government to reconsider its de
nunciation.

these "non-moral multitudes," who,
from the cradle to I the ... grave, have
faced the "serere pressure of competi

miserable exigencies of unmerited
want," and who "inevitably compare
their condition with the ostentation of
unearned wealth," the profusion of un
checked luxury and the. insolence of
unchastened "power."
The Canon says that when it is re
membered that V'these cruel, shocking
contrasts are no longer ' regarded : with
the dull stare of fatalistic' ignorance,

TOKIO. Japan, March 20.â If you
really care to understand the character
of the Japanese people, to know some
thing about their main springs of ac
tion, you must possess an Infinite
patience and a very zealous per
sistence- They are far from being an
open bock. It is not merely that they
hide themselves behind the well-known
mask of Orientalism which Occidentals
rarely penetrate. It is something
more. The mask they wear is meant
to defend them against the prying
curiosity of their own people as. well
us against foreigners. Not even to
friends may they freely reveal thero>
selves.
It is only when the wells of the spirit
are sounded and the deepest waters
are troubled that emotion finds relief
in", outward show â that is, emotion
whose manifestation might affect oth
ers unpleasantly â sadness, trouble or
deep gTicf. Bushido would have re
pressed it even under the most trying
circumstances, but not even Bushido
can wholly turn a warm hearted hu
man being into a stone, and after all
the Japanese are human, with blood
that is red and hearts that leap just
the same as some rural demonstrative
peoples we know. It "would not be
strange if the average man who had
observed them here in Tokio during the
last two months should begin to doubt
that.
IJUSIIIDO'S GRIP.
There has been so much repression
of the^natural feelings, such a shutting
down wf the safety valves of joy and
sorrow, as at times to have been un
canny. One mutt have shadowed
Bushido well to grasp the full signifi
cance of these last few weeks. Bush
idoâit means literally military knight
ways â was the teaching of the Samurai
â the precepts of the chivalry that lost
its commanding grip on Jap^a-n hardly
a generation ago. Bushido was the
incarnation of loyalty and the' soul of
honor. The ten million Samurai, who
followed its instruction, impressed their
ways upon the whole people. It was a
force that continued after the institu
tion it ruled was dead. Bushido to-day
is a vital factor in Japanese life, and
although its once mastering influence
may have begun to. wane it is still suf
ficient explanation of the astonishing
emotional repressions of the last two
months. For politeness was and is a
Fine qua non of gentleness, and to show
grief, or pain, or any unpleasant emo
tion, might awaken similar unhappy
feeling's in the breast of the observer,
and that would be not only unfortun
ate but most impolite. It was that
conception of politeness which made a
man announce the death of his dearest
relation or friend with bright eyes and
a smile on his face.
"It. Ss that power and habit of con
cealing the real feelings," said a Jap
anese to me yesterday,' "which has
made. other people fail to understand
us. Even their diplomatists have fail
ed to understand us. I think if it had
not been so we should* not now be at
war with Russia."
PATRIOTIC I DRAMA. .
â¢ My friend had taken me to a theater
to see the new war play, and it was
a remark of mine about the acting
which provoked his comment. The
play itself was a curious hodge-podge,
without plot, all beginning and appar
ently no end. It may be going yet.. for
all I know. I sat through five hours
of It and there was not even the be
ginning of development of a p'ot and
no sign of approaching termination.
But there were some things of extra
ordinary interest Â¦ about it and many
worth peeing.
It was the frank revelation of human
emotion on the part of the actors
in their portrayal of character chosen
from the common walks of life that
struck me most forcibly. There were
open and unreserved tears, and much
lamentation because sons, husbands,
fathers wore " called V* the colors and
going away to war. Even men sobbed.
My friend sat with body bent forward
and head bowed in his hands, watch
ing intently, as I supposed, the strik
ing display of feeling. It annoyed me.
I was inclined to think it a grotesque
parody. It was not Bushido at all.
"I don't believe it at all!" I said to
him. "Is It true, all that weeping?"
He did not reply, and 1 looked down
and saw the big tears falling unchecked
from his eyes. It was true, then, after
all. The actors were faithfully pre
senting to the public a phase of Jap
anese life that the persons they repre
sented would never have revealed.
PLOT OP THE VIjAY.
It was a simple scene. The stage
setting represented a room In the home
of a Jinrikisba man. He was a reserv
ist soldier, a^M the mobilization order
had come directing him to go to the
barracks at 8 o'clock that evening. His
little son was playing In the yard, wav
ing a flag and shouting "Bonzai." As
the soldier brushed up his uniform
and preparted to put it on he talked

Early in the morning the Hereros
attempted to surround and cut off the
rear guard of Major von Glasenapp's
force, consisting of Fisher's company,
which was well armed and partly
mounted. The enemy opened a vigor
ous fire, but was repulsed after a
fight lasting three and a half hours,
the rear guard having been reinforced
by Count Brockdorff's company and
First Lieutenant Manshor's artillery.
The enemy were pursued for an hour
but escaped, leaving fifty-two of their
number dead. â¢
In the meantime the head of the col

lasting an hour. The German losses
were: Lieutenant Noerr, four non-com

and eleven men wounded.
The artillery action was brilliant. The
Germans suffered from want of ser

3Ien on the California and

Anxious, for an Advance
â¢ Following closely, on the disturbed re
lations between the United Railroads
and Carmen's -Unlon,^ there has
been circulated a srbry to the effect
that the employes of 'the Union-street
Cable Company' and the California
street Cable Company are' preparing to
submit to their respective employers a
demand for an increase of salary in
keeping with ,that asked for by the
union men on the lines of the United
Railroads.
It was stated yesterday that the de
mands would *be placed before the di
rectors of the Union and California
street companies early during the com
ing, week and that in all probability the
men would join with the carmen of the
United Railroads in their effort to ob
tain an advance In wages, and in the
event of a strike on the latter roads
they would go. out with their fellow
workers in the other company.
Carmen on both the 'California and
the Union street lines freely discussed
their proposed demands for an increase
yesterday, and it was stated by sev
eral employes of the former line that
the demands would be presented to the
companies in a few days. When Presi
dent Newhall of the Union-street line
was asked about the report he admit
ted he was advised Friday afternoon
of the purposed demand.
"I was told by one of the operating
officials of the road," said he, "that. the
employes were preparing to make a de
mand for an increased wage schedule,
but as yet we have* heard nothing di
rect from the executive members of the
union. Personally I have made no ef
fort to inquire into the matter."
j Asked what the company would do
in case of a demand being made, Mr.
Newhall replied that he had a decided
opinion In the matter, but was not In
clined to express.it at this particular
time. . .
At the offices of General Manager
Chapman of the I ..United Railroads It
was stated yesterday that no new de
velopments had arisen out of the com

that probably none would arise until

tears again. A bugle 'sounded and the
soldier leaped to his feet to respond.
There was scarcely time to embrace
his wife and he -was dashing away,
cheered on by his friends, when the
boy ran to him and clasping his legs,
besought him not to go. The mother
was too overcome to speak, and the
friends, trying to cheer, were furtively
weeping again. The soldier thrust the
boy away and ran off as the curtain
fell. I looked at my friend % and he
was again weeping.
That was the private ' soldier. The
next scene showed a room in the house
of a young lieutenant, who had already
gone away. The wife 1 and her maid
were talking. The maid, ; tearful and
unhappy, was expressing her surprise
that her mistress had shed not a; tear,
had exhibited no sign of unhappiness
or of anxiety for the young officer to
whom she had. been married so . short
a time. .She had not even gone to the
station to say good-by, but Instead had
sent her old servant. The mistress
simply fenced with the maid and made
indirect response. While they; were
talking the, old servant returned from
the station. Both women questioned
him as to his parting with his master.
"Did he weep?" asked the maid.
"Was he well?" asked ttie wife.
As the old man described the scenes
about the station his emotion became
stronger and stronger. At last he
bowed his head and sobbed aloud. Still
the young wife showed no sign of grief.
Surprised at this, the old man lifted
his head and asked her why.
"It is not the way of the service,"
she replied. "We have been very
happy here and I would rather think
of him as still 'sitting by my side."
The old man resumed his description
of the scenes at the station and told
how an old. general who had been
crippled in the war with China and
could not perform active service had
cheered on the young master, and bid
den him have no care but for his coun
try and his honor. His mistress inter
rupted and asked if the master had
any message. Yes, he had. It was
addressed to him and was only an in
junction to look well after his mistress.
Again his emotion overcame him and
he gave .way to a renewed outburst of
weeping. In which the maid Joined.
Both servants wept bitterly, but the
mistress turned her back on them and
maintained her proud self-control. *
THE COMEDY ELEMENT.
Then to relieve the strained feelings
of the audience some comedy was in
troduced. The villain appeared in the
shape of the father of the girl whom
the lieutenant Â¦ had Jilted when he
married. the heroic young woman who
refused to weep. The father had sworn
to revenge his daughter's" wounded
pride. He had bought a note which' the
young" lieutenant had signed as guar
antor for a friend.' The friend had been
called to the colors also, and being
unable to pay, the holder of the note
had ; come to demand his money from
the lieutenant's wife.
It was a very unpopular proceeding.
The audience \ demanded vigorously
that he be thrown out, or killed. Some
wanted his head cut off. Others \ de
sired to have him strangled. Some
asked to have his neck broken. But
unmindful of Jeers . and taunts he
steadily demanded his money. Finally
the old servant, whose tears had been
dried, fell on him and smote him, hip
and thigh, finally chucking him out of
the house bodily. There was a first
rate fight, in the Japanese open handed
style, and the old servant was getting
the better of it, amid the vociferous
plaudits of the audience, when the vil
lain's daughter appeared and ran in to
help her father.
Thereupon the maid came out with
a bowl of salt and began to throw it
in liberal quantities on, the Jilted girl.
Four or five soldiers came along the
street just then and separated the
combatants. The villain promptly be
gan to declaim to the officer who was
In command of the men and to demand
his money. He had not gone far when
the old servant, who was panting with
rage, and exertion, and eager to%et at
his man again, interrupted and. ex
plained the true state of affairs. The
result was a renewal of the scuffle, in
which all the soldiers joined in pound
ing the villain with the unqualified and
vigorous approval of the audience. But
another officer appeared . who put a
stop to the row, and the scene ended
by his paying his brother officer's debt,
to the great disgust of the old servant*
and "of-. the audience.
I3IPORTANCE OF THE LANDLORD.
The next scene was a variation of
the same old theme. This time the sol
dier was a. sergeant, the only support
of his mother, who was very ill, and his
sister. Again the landlord appeared â
he seems to play a very important part
in the lives of the poorer class of
Japanese. His son was madly in love
with the sergeant's sister, so madly
that when she refuseM to marry him he
crossing these tall bamboo poles sup
port lines from which scores of small
flags are suspended, many American
and English flags mixed with the Rising
Sun emblem of Japan.
At every station there is always a
crowd waiting which wildly cheers
every train, whether it carries troops
or not. I have seen a solitary man
plodding along a country road drop his
burden and fling up his arms, splitting
his throat with "Bonzai" as a train
rumbled past.
Night before last the men of the first
division were entrained for the front
at the Shimbashi station, the main
station of Tokio. It took nearly all
night to get them away. The first reg
iment marched under my window about
midnight. A cheering mob flocked along
the street with and after them. Lan
terns waved and bobbed about, swing
ing from long bamboo poles, like a wild
column of gigantic fireflies. At 2 o'clock
another regiment passed, and again
there was a cheering mob of patriots in
attendance. A third regiment passed
two hours later, and the number of
those out to see them off was increased
rather than diminished. I wonder If
the demonstrative people at home
would stay up all night to march to
the station with outgoing troops?
Rather. I think, there would be a howl
in the npwspapers to have the men de
part in the daytime. Â» But that would
not be Bushido.
furnished the comedy that enlivened
the scene by repeatedly threatening to
batter his brains out on the pump. The
sergeant came to say good-by to his
sister and was going to leave without
seeing his mother, fearing that the
parting would make her worse. But
she heard him and called him back.
She Was of the old Samurai stock and
war had been the lot of her family for
many generations. .
" "I belong to a house that has been
fed by the spear," she said. It was
her pride, not grief, that her son
should be a soldier. Grief could come
only through disgrace to his honor, and
she bade him go and fight bravely for
his country.
Promptly upon his going came the
landlord, endeavoring to force the girl
to marry his son through the old
means so well known to stage villains
all over the world, of demanding the
money that was due. But the lovesick
son would not submit to the employ
ment of such distressful means, and
again threatened to " destroy himself.
The savior of the girl appeared in the
shape of an officer of the Soldiers' Re
lief Association, who made the land
lord agree to cut the rent in two, and
promised to see that the reduced sum
was paid regularly. What became of
the lovesick son did not appear, for the
revolving stage swung around and
there appeared, a scene representing
the landing of the Japanese troops â
ten of them and six officers, all seasick
âat Chemulpo.
BATTLE SCENES.
After that there were battle scenes
of most extraordinary character for a
long time, and when we finally came
away, an amazing Russian, ambushed
behind huge red whiskers, who had
been taken prisoner at Pingyang, was
about to undergo trial for his life.
So without plot, and with much repe
tition of incident, the play ran on. Â¦ But
the thing about it all that was of strik
ing interest was that the audience en-
Joyed and applauded and shared in a
revelation of intimately personal emo
tions on the stage such as not one of
thjm would have permitted himself to
make save in the privacy of his own
home and before his own people. It
was a phase of Japanese life which
can be seen only in the theater, and yet
it was true. Its effect upon the patri
otic people . in the audience was very
marked. When in one of the battle
scenes the Emperor's proclamation de
claring war was read it was heard in
breathless silence and cheered to the
echo. ,
The people all over the country have
waked up at last from the trance-like
repression of the first few days after
the war begap. Now down through the
country traversed by the railroads flags
flutter constantly from every, house,
and strings of streamers Haunt from
many poles. At nearly every road
In an instant all this laughter and
high spirits was changed, even to
FROM LAUGHTER TO TEARS.
"It Is quite true," he said. "The old
custom does not permit one to betray
his emotion In the presence of strang
ers, or even of his friends, but in the
home it Is different. There one may
be natural without being Impolite."
Then came in three friends of the
soldier, full of excitement at his going,
congratulating him on the opportunity
to fight for his country and the Em
peror, and all protesting their own de
sire to go. They brought a supper and
soon had it spread out. Their en
thusiasm was so infectious that no
trace of sadness could linger in the
room. The supper was very appro
priate. First there was raw fish, the
fish called katsuo, which is the word
that means victory. Then there was
buckwheat, seiro, which the audience
promptly Interpreted, sel being to fight
with and ro the first part of the Jap
anese name for the Russians. This
was eaten with chopsticks â nihon
nohashi â and Ninon is the name of
Japan.
Japan, therefore, was swallowing up
the Russians in victory, and the pala
table meal was washed own by the
wine called Masanume. Masanume
was the most . famous swordsmith of
Japan's feudal days â so famous that he
gave his name to the weapon he made,
and now Masanume means sword
throughout Japan. I
Presently came the landlord, who had
heard the news. This was a good land
lord, actuated by a genuine patriotism
that made him Immensely popular with
the audience. He assured the sad
hearted wife that she need not worry.
While the soldier was away there
should be no rent demanded for the
house. The soldier and his wife strove
to conceal their feelings from the land
lord, and the scene became quite cheer
ful again. This was Bushido. My
friend sat up and replied to the long
unanswered question.

NEWCHWAXG, April 9. â General
Kuropatkin made a flank movement on
all newspaper correspondents to-day,
who had been picking up stray bits of
misinformation about the Russian
plans to let the enemy land in the
northern end of Llaotung: GulL
Before sunrise this morning two brig
ades of infantry were marching west
from Haicheng, followed by a regi
ment of artillery, and the advance col
umn of these soldiers was passing
south of this city in the afternoon,
bound for the southwest bank of the
Liao River. The soldiers had come
down in the night from Liaoyang, and
to-morrow â¬000 infantry will follow,
their mission being to cover the gulf
line from the west bank of the Liao
River to the east bank of the Tungsha.
The fact that General Kuropatkin
did not disturb the troops in the Hai
cheng military caxnp. or at Kaiping,
further south, is accepted as proof that
he is holding them intact for any ad
vance by the enemy from the Bay of
Korea or across the Southern Yalu.

The naval mobllzation was gazetted
to-day. It refers only to officers and
men of the reserve in European Russia
and not to ships. The moblization Is
due to the necessity of providing full
crews for the Black Sea and "Baltic
fleets, which .will eo into commission
at the opening of navigation. It is an
open secret now that several thousand
sailors belonging to these fleets, which*
had been laid up for the winter, were
sent to Vladivostok or Port Arthur to
supply the places of time-expired men,
as well as the places of those who were
wounded or Otherwise incapacitated, j
The men now called out will be used
also to supply an adequate reserve

A correspondent with the Russian
outposts, writing from Antung, on the
Yalu River, under date of March 19,
describes the awful state of the road
on the journey from Fengwangcheng
to Antung. The road, he says, is im
passable for vehicles. The correspond
ent depicts Antung as a miserable col
lection of hovels, the inhabitants of
which, on account of its scarcity, can
not afford timber for fires and use
straw instead. The country between
Fengwangcheng and Antung is sparse
ly settled. The Chinese avoid the
highroads, preferring the mountain
fastnesses. Milk, butter. and eggs are
almost unknown.
"I witnessed the Japanese landing at
Weihaiwei. It was excellently per
formed, but there was no enemy to
offer resistance, the Chinese having
fled. Yet it required four days to dis
embark 21,000 men. If the Japanese
attempt to land anywhere within strik
ing distance of Newchwang we can
easily concentrate a force to oppose
them faster than they can disembark."
The opinion now is that the Japanese
will try flanking movements from Ta
kushan, west of Antung, at the head
of the Gulf of Korea, In connection
with their advance on the Yalu River,
but the authorities here make no dis
play of nervousness, manifesting the
utmost confidence in the plan of cam
paign marked out by General Kuro

ROAD IS EXECRABLE!
ST. PETERSBURG, April 9. â The
best-Informed military . circles no
longer expect a Japanese landing at
the head of the Llaotung Gulf. .They
believe the Japanese have missed their
opportunity, the Russians being now
too strong.
A Russian officer who accompanied
the Japanese army during the war
with China said:

last fall was without definite result.
This morning at 4 o'clock In all the
orthodox churches occurred the cere
mony of the burial of Christ. Pre
ceded by the clergy bearing lanterns
and silver crosses, representing the
crucifixion and carried on their shoul
ders, the bishops and deacons passed
around the outside of the churches,
Â¦ followed by a long funeral procession,
after which the crosses were brought
Inside and were deposited in the sep
ulchres.
During the day there were no serv
ices In the churches, which remained
completely dark, save for a few stray,
lighted candles. Nevertheless, they
were constantly filled with, people,
many bt them prostrated in prayer.
All of the papers â¢ express the hope
that the sound of the church bells at
Easter tide be not broken by the boom
ing of guns at Port Arthur. The Listok
says
"Let us hope that the God of Peace
will soften the hearts of our foes, at
least on Easter morning."
FEAST OF THE RESURRECTION.
The Russian church and people at
midnight celebrated the resurrection
of the Savior. For dramatic effect this
Russian Easter service is unrivaled.
For this one night the spirit of genu
ine democracy reigns in autocratic
Russia. Upon' the acclaiming of the
arising of Christ the great white Czar
salutes with a kiss the sentry posted
at the palace door, and the highest
dignitary and the lowest mujik ex
change the Joyful tidings with equal
freedom. In honor, of the great relig
ious festival Russia's Capitol was
adorned and illuminated. From every
building hung the national colors, and
in every window burned a candle, a
privilege permitted on this red letter
night of the Russian calendar.
The most popular places in the cele
bration of the event were Peter the
Great's little house, across the , Neva,
where reposes the ikon which, accord
ing to Russian legends, saved the day
at Poltava; the cathedral of Our Lady
of Kasan, who helped drive the Poles
back from (Moscow, where are preserv

ed French .battle flags,. and the famous :
cathedral of St; , Isaac, >vnere are de

priceless gems, one of which jewels is
the mate of the celebrated kohinoor.
The service here was attended by the
entire diplomatic corps, while' pressing
around the outside unnumbered thdu
sands stood for hours with tapers in
their hands awaiting the announce
ment that the Savior had arisen.

PARIS, April 9.â Ex-Queen Isabella
of Spain, grandmother of King Alfonso,
died here at 9:45 o'clock this morning
of influenza, with complications.
The American embassy, which is op
posite the Palatte Castle, on the ave
nue Kleber, the late Quee'n's residence,
was early informed of the Queen's
death, and Embassador Porter was
among the first to call and sign the
palace register.
The Infantas Isabella, Eulalle and
Marie, daughters of the late Queen,
were at the bedside when she died.
Th<Â» Quef-n had been afflicted with
the grip for two months, .which grad
ually affected the lungs. Shortly be
fore the. Queen died the papal nuncio
was summoned to* administer the last
sacrament, but, owing to his absence
from Paris, the last rites of-the church
were administered ,by the Vicar of the.
Church of St. Pierre. \
Prince Ferdinand immediately tele
graphed the rows to the King of
Spain, to Foreign Minister Delcasse
and to all the European sovereigns. M.
Delcasse called during the day and
was admitted to the death chamber,
and President Loubet sent an officer
of his. household to present his con
dolences.
It is understood that King Alfonso
will not come to France for the funeral,
as he did not come for the funeral of
his grandfather, King Francis, who
died in April. 1902.
The deceased Queen had been one of
the conspicuous figures of Paris since
she left Spain. After her abdication,
in 1870, she continued to live with
queenly magnificence here, giving
largely to charitable and religious
works.
Following the death of former
Queen Isabella of Spain the feeling is
expressed that the United States ought
to acquire her former residence for
the use of the American embassy. It
Is one of the finest properties in Paris
and is immediately opposite the" pres
ent rented quarters of the embassy.
Since France purchased grounds for
her embassy at Washington the
French officials say it would be a
proper reciprocation for the United
States to secure her own embassy in
Paris. However, no steps are likely to
be taken in the matter owing to the
great value of the late Queen's prop
erty. Â¦â¢"'Â¦'.'Â¦"'â¢ ; yV-'S* *Â£. r '-'\\;(-

EX-QUEEN ISABELLA OF SPAIN.
WHO HAS PASSED AWAY AT
HER PARIS RESIDENCE.
NEW YORK, April 9.â The market
was sluggish to-day and trading was.
dull. Prices went off. in the early mar
ket, owing to the impression created
by yesterday's trading that a reac
tion was due and traders inclined to
profits. There was no sustaining force
by the" strength of a few stocks such
as covered the realizing, sales of yes
terday and Thursday. With this ad
vantage lacking, holders did not seem
disposed to depress the' Belling und the
decline was very moderate. Before the
closing the . market recovered rather
more than its decline and ciosed strong
at small net gains, j The decline in the
cash holdings in the banks aroused no
misgivings owing to the belief that
yesterday's receipts of Japanese gold
did not figure in the statement. Th.r
extension of the loan account was not
unexpected. Although that item was
carried to a new high record by the
amount of the increase and a
considerable inroad was made on the
surplus item. the. extreme ease in the
money market makes the growth of
the loan item look healthy. The pres
ent condition of money in New York
is fairly plethoric and arouses some
discontent among bankers, who are
quite satisfied to see further exports
of gold. The week's bank clearances
throughout the United States show an
increase over the corresponding week
of last year for the first time In a long
while. The growth is found in the flvw
largest cities outside of New York and
Boston, especially the great cotton cen
ters. For all other cities the average
is less than last week. Total sales
of bonds (par value), $940,000. "
ACTIVITY AND VARIETY.
The stock market has maintained a
considerable degree of activity and va
riety this week. Occasional reactions
and constant Irregularity have not de
tracted from the appearance ' of
strength. The action of the market
in face of the heavy realizing sales has
been an incentive to a more cheerful
speculative sentiment rather than' an
obstacle. The profltrtaking has been
achieved at small expense of values
and has r.ot interfered with the pro
gress-of the market by the succession
to the new points of strength. Much
of the dealings were supposed to be. on
behalf of professional operators of a
large class and the occasional large
selling by the same interests argiies
a considerable distribution "of â¢ securi
ties. .The. feature of the market would
naturally depend on the extent to
which 'the. j- distribution represents a
real digestion of securities. ., Where
trie secondary vstage ; of ~; a spec
ulative advance represents a pass
ing from hands of strong, oper
ators to those of small speculators of
small resources and timid methods, the
advance is soon followed by reaction
and letting go of holdings. ;\r;
The belief that there has been an im
portant absorption of stocks. this week
by inside interests in various proper
ties and of an investment character
has been a. strong influence in main
taining the firm undertone of the mar
ket. The Improvement In the specu
lative tone of the market was due in
the first place to the small effect pro
duced by various Incidents that seemed
to be unfavorable to values. The suc
cessive advances following these devel
opments caused a belief that the bad
news had been already discounted,
leaving no prospect- of further declines
and pointing to the long side of the
market as the one of advantage for
professional operations.
BOND MAHIvKT IMPROVES.
The strength which followed the de
cision of the Supreme Court in the
Northern Securities case was the first
striking demonstration of this tendency
of the market. This was followed this
week by the reception accorded to the
announcement of the appeal of the
courts by the Union Pacific interests to
NEW .YORK, April 9. â James W.
Goodman, a machinist, was arrested
here to-day, charged with having made
threats against the life of William C.
Greene, president of the Greene Con
solidated Copper Company.
Goodman has been In the city since
last September, having given his ad
dress as Nogales, Ariz, and was un
derstood to have the representa
tive of a mining company at Sonora,
Mexico.* \ 'Â¦'
The charge of felonious assault with
attempt to kill was made when Good
man was arraigned In court, and he
was held in $5000 bail for examination
on Monday.
It was> alleged that there had been
some differences between Greene- and
Goodman on a mining deal. Goodman
met Greene to-day near Broadway, and,
it is charged, there threatened to kill
him; but Green told him to come down
to his office and matters would be sat
isfactorily settled. They went by an
elevated train downtown, the trip be
ing uneventful. After getting into the
office, it Is charged, Goodman said to
Greene:
"I want that $500,000 that is due me
in that mining deal. I want a settle
ment."
As if to omphasize his words, it is
further alleged. Goodman drew a re
volver and pointed it at Greene. Dur
ing the controversy which followed, it
is alleged. Goodman three times point
ed the revolver at Greene and each
time threatened to shoot him.
'Greene excused himself, leaving
Goodman in the room with Robbins,.
the secretary of the company. Greene
hurried to the Old Slip police station
and told about the trouble. Patrolmen
were sent post haste to the office, and
Goodman was disarmed. Goodman,
after the two revolvers had been taken
from him. laughed and said: ,
"Well, you've got them all."
Greene, in stating the case to Magis
trate Ccrnell, said: . j
"Goodman disposed of stock in a !
Mexican mine to a man named Smith.
He then drank and gambled the money
away, and it was not until he had spent
all the money and found himself broke
that he came to me and claimed that
he had be^n swindled."

"Do ynu think this man can furnish

NEW YORK. April 9.â The Financier
says: One feature of the official state
ment of the New York Associated
Banks last week was the new high rec
ord for loans and deposits; another
feature was the wide discrepancy be
tween the estimated and the actual
changes In the cash items, though this
may be partially explained by the fact
that the estimates covered seven, while
the returns covered six days of the
bank week; and still another feature
â¢was the verv slight gain in the bank
holdings of public funds. Indicating
that these holdings were fully account
ed for In the previous week. The
banks lost $S02,S00 cash, while the es
timates which were based on the trace
able movements of money showed a
gain of $546,800.
ThlÂ« discrepancy was doubtless due,
as above noted, to the difference in
the number of days included in the
estimate, and al^> to transfers of
funds of trust companies incident to
the placing of the Pennsylvania notes
on the last day of the previous week.
Th" deposits increased $16,143,400 and
the r efiuired reserve was thereby aug
mented $4.0S5,S50. which sum. added to
the loss of cash, made $4.S3S,C50 de
crease on surplus reserve to $22,916,
400. Computed upon the basis of de
posits, less those of $56,125,400 of pub
lic funds, the surplus is $36,496,750.
. It may be noted that, so far as the
cash is concerned, the statement was
made on rising.avcrages, there having
been received by the banks on Fri
day $3,937,000. which was transferred
hither from San Francisco; this re
ceipt counted for an average of only
one day in the bank statement.
Loans were increased $15,S25,000. re
flecting the placing of the Pennsylvania
$50,000,000 notes on Friday of the pre
vious week, and also some further cor
poration ;i5 well as syndicate borrow
ings. The public deposits were in
creased by $14,000. indicating slight
additions to these funds in the spe
cially designated depositories.
The statement dtd not show a grood
balance, the sum of the increase in
loans less the loss of cash being $1,120,
300 smaller than the increase in depos
its. The daily average of bank clear
ings was $152,000,000. or $15,000,000 more
than in the previous week, and the
clearings on Saturday, reflecting Fri
day's business, were $119,412,795; these
large clearings probably indicate shift
ing of accounts, as the volume of
transactions on the Stock Exchange
was comparatively email on Friday.
The changes in the item of loans show
that six banks gained $11.SOO,000 net.

According to a story told by one of
the prisoners they had decided upon
a trip to Philadelphia with the hope
of Increasing their wealth and while
drinking beer discussed the use of
"knockout drops." All expressed a
desire to learn the best method and
quantity necessary, so a small quan
tity of liquid containing opium was
pourc-d into the beer. "Boston Frank"
emptied his glass and collapsed. He
was taken into the open air and an
ambulance finally called, but he died
on the way to the hospital. The
others drank only a small quantity
and soon recovered. They were all
imprisoned pending action by the Cor
oner.

sharply criticized the tendency in
present day business and professional
life to discriminate against women
who are handicapped with the task
Â«f helping; to support families. She
f.rfrued that in such cases women
were striving to fulfill the obligations
both of father and of mother, and de
clared it was the duty of the state,
by financial aid. to assume half their
burdens, thus giving them opportun
ity to devote themselves exclusively
to maternal tasks.

rear a large family meant. Mrs. Mc-
Culloch said, the impoverishment of
the family purse, the early death of
the mother and for the children pen

declared that neither the mother nor

was being held for burglary and his
preliminary* examination had been set
for' to-day. When the jailer opened
the jail this morning Miller was miss-

wore a dark coat, with a khaki gar
ment under it, and light trousers.
t CHICAGO, April 9.â Plans for the
new capital of the Philippines were
made known by Secretary Taft He
bald:
"The new capital will be about 155
miles from Manila on a plat of ground
over 5000 feet above the sea level,
which will make it far more healthy
for Americans.
"It is to be to the Philippines what
Simla is to India and will be of great
benefit -to the islands- The climate
is superb, the location good and. the
new oportunities for men with cap
ital will be very great."

' His Retirement From Office Will Set
tle a Row That Has Long Exist
ed Between Ohio Politicians.
WASHINGTON. Auril 9.â The Sec
! retary of the Treasury has received
; the resignation of Â£. H. Zurhorst as
i Collector of Customs at Sandusky,
j Ohio, to take effect on the appoint
i ment and qualification of his succes
sor.
Zurhorst wag appointed Collector at
Sandusky by the late President Me
j Kinley at the instance of the late Sen
j ator Hanna. Later charges were filed
I against him with the department. He
! was opposed vigorously by Senator
Foraker, who urged upon the Presi
dent the immediate appointment of a
j successor. During Senator Haniia's
lifetime he warmly supported Zur
horst and the case was one of the
acute points of difference . between
Senators Hanna and Foraker. Of late
It has seemed likely that Zurhorst
would not be reappointed, although no
I definite decision, so far as is known
j publicly, has been reached. Both
: Senators Dick and Foraker have had
J conferences with the President ' re
i sardlng the case within a few days.
j By ZurhorstV voluntary act in resign
] ing the offlcefthe case, so far as. he-is
J concerned, 1^ ended. No intimation
j as to ,who may be his successor has
been given.

SANTA ROSA. April 9.â The Napa
and Sonoma Valleys Conference Li
brary Association of California held a
meeting here to-day la tne handsome
new Public Library. It was one of
the most interesting sessions of the
association.
Many notables in library work In
California were present and interest-
Ing papers were read to the assem
blage. For the day ail business in the
library was suspended, sare that of
entertaining the visitors, and every
one had a most enjoyable time. Xear
3y all the visitors, numbering over
fifty, came in over the California
North-western road in a special car.
provided by the company for their
pleasure.
Arriving in this city the visitors
were met by a reception committee
and taken on a sight-seeing expedi
tion. A trip was made to the dome of
the Courthouse, from which point of
vantage a splendid panoramic view
Â¦was obtained of the city and its en
vironment. The beautiful stone li
brary, a gift of Andrew Carnegie, was
inspected by the visitors and many
compliments were bestowed on its in
terior arrangement.
Special XMspetca ttÂ» Tke Call-
Detective E. L. Gibson ; was given
the warrant to serve upon Mrs. Bot
kin. He went to the Branch. County
Jail- and was informed by the matron
that Mrs. Botkin was sick in bed. Gib
son said he would have to serve the
warrant, and the matron retorted that
he would have to assume the responsi
bility for the consequences. Gibson
went to Mrs. Botkln's cell and found
her in bed, with her sister, Mrs. Rob
erts, sitting beside her. Gibson ex
plained the reason for his visit and
Mrs. Botkin said she would waive the
reading of the â¢ contents of the war
rant, which was thereupon served
upon her. She will be brought to
court 'to-morrow morning by a Deputy
Sheriff. {
"Mrs. Botkin," said Gibson, after his
return, "did not seem to me to be sick.
She took the matter coolly. I was
told by the doctor who had been visit
ing her that she was, in his opinion,
shamming. I have not the slightest
doubt but that she will be able to be
in court on Monday morning."
Chief Wittman had an interview
with Jacob Goetjen, one of the jurors
in the case of Mrs. Dunning, yester
day morning in regard to the alleged
attempt to bribe him. â¢ He repeated
to the Chief the tale he had told of a
young man calling at his store and of
fering him 550 to give a verdict for
the defendant, and that four or five
others had been "fixed." He said he
would easily recognize the man again,
and the Chief advised him to keep a
sharp lookout for him and notify the
police at once if he should come across
him.
In ., accordance with his resolution
not to afford Mrs. Cordelia Botkin any
loophole of. escape from the conse
quences of her atrocious crimes. Dis
trict Attorney Byington yesterday
morning prepared a complaint charg
ing her with the murder of Mrs. Ida
Henrietta Deane on August 11, 1898.
Mrs. Deane died through -eating â¢poi
soned candy sent ,by Mrs. Botkin to
Mrs. John P. Dunning, Mrs. Deane's
sister, to Dover, Del. The warrant was
sworn to before Police Judge Conlan
by Joshua D. Deane, the widower.
The intention is to take the testimony
of the witnesses from Delaware while
they are in this city, and .it can be
read at the trial in the Superior Court,
thereby saving the expense of bringing
them here again in case Mrs. Botkin,
for the second time convicted of the
murder of .Mrs. Dunning, secures a
new trial.
SAN JOSE, April 9.â Fifty tons of
dried prunes will be given away at the
St. Louis exposition to advertise Santa
Clara County's greatest resource. A
practical demonstration of cooking and
serving prunes will be made in the
Santa Clara County buiMlng at the
fain Besides this small cartons of the
prunes and pamphlets containing one
hundred receipts for cooking prunes
will be given to visitors to take home.
The San Jose Grange, Fanners' Club
and the Chamber of Commerce have
taken up the matter and the County
Commissioners to the fair have entered
heartily into the proposed exhibit.
The matter was up before the Grange
to-day. Commissioners Barnett and
V. A. Scheller appeared before that
body and stated that the commission
would donate the space, lights and
5100 a month for the period of six
months for the proposed demonstration
provided the prunes were furnished
and competent parties put in charge.
The Grange decided to go right ahead
with the project, and as the Farmers*
Club Is already pledged to the move
ment, there is no doubt that it will be
carried out.
The solicitation of the vast amount
of fruit needed will now be commenced.
Every gTange and farmers' club in the
county will solicit for fruit for the
demonstration, and the packers have
intimated that they will give large
quantities. It is believed that this will
be the toest advertisement Santa
Clara County can secure.

PASO ROBLES, April 9:~ Owing to a
series of minor accidents the special
train bearing the California Promotion
Committee arrived here at 3:30 p. m.,
an hour and a half late, and though
but a brief stop was made many availed
themselves of an oportunity for a hot
sulphur bath. The mammoth hot sul
phur well at the Hotel El Paso de Ro
bles was opened for the gaze of the
visitors after lunch at that hostelry.
The site of the new $100,000 bathhouse
and the various mineral wells and
springs were shown the visitors. A
delegation of local business men met
the visitors at the train and escorted
them about the town. Many expre
sions were heard of the delights of
Southern and Central California and
the enjoyable trip which the excur
sionists were having. The wather has
been unusualy warm for April, but the
country is now at its best.
SALINAS. April 9.â The California

its special train at 6:40 this evening.
Owing to a change in the plans of the

The day was swelteringly hot for
this section and while it was weather
Joyously welcomed by the rancher and

However, the impression on the mem

Bishop."
BATHS AT PASO ROBLES.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, April 9. â The
California Promotion Committee vis
ited San Luis Obispo to-day at 1:30
p. m., Just an hour and 30 minutes be
hind the schedule time. The full stop
promised, forty-five minutes, " was
given this place and the drive through
town to points of Interest was made
as planned in carriages. Then the
visitors were returned to the train at
the Ramona Hotel station.
SANTA BARBARA, April 9.â The
excursion of the California Promotion
Committee arrived in Santa Barbara
two and a half hours late on account
of an accident to the engine near
Chatsworth which stalled the entire
special until a passing freight engine
was secured. The party was sched
uled to arrive here at 6 a. m. and re
main until 8:30. The local Chamber
of Commerce Â«had made extensive
preparations for the entertainment of
the party, including breakfast at the
Potter Hotel and a short drive around
the city.
The visitors were driven to the Pot
ter in tally-hos immediately on their
arrival and a hurried breakfast was
served, but the proposed drive had to
be abandoned, much to the regret of
ell parties. The day was ideal and the
excursionists were much disappointed
at having to make such close conec
tions. The train pulled out of Santa
Barbara at 1 o'clock, one and a half
hours behind schedule time."

cal Board of Trade and other citizens

SANTA CRUZ, April 9.â The Califor
nia Promotion Committee was royally
received this evening on arrival on the
special train shortly before 8 o'clock.
The Angel Islan'd band was here in
their honor and the members of the
Santa. Cruz Promotion Committee and
of the Board of Trade gathered at the
Hotel St. George and, headed by the
band, marched down Pacific avenue to
receive. the guests. The special train
stopped just below the Sea Beach Ho
tel and was greeted with music. The
visitors were given a dinner at the Sea
Beach Hotel. The dining-room and the
tables were decorated with flowers in
their honor. After dinner came the re
ception, and from half-past 8 to 10 citi
zens in great numbers called and paid
their respects to the visitors. On the
veranda was stationed the Angel Isl
and band, which discoursed music. A
number of stereopticon views, showing
all the principal points of interest in
the^'county and vicinity, all of which

WATSONVILL.E. April 9.â The com
mittee appointed by the Pajaro Valley
Board of Trade to arrange for the re
ception of the members of the Califor
nia Promotion Committee found that
the limited stop of the train would not
permit of a lengthy entertainment. In
order to crowd all the hospitality possi
ble into the half hour of time, a recep
tion was arranged at the depot. This,
too, proved a disappointment. The
train was so late that the . immense
crowd dwindled to a very few repre
sentatives of the Board of Trade, who
remained to load the valley's offerings
into the train on its arrival at 8:15
o'clock. These were of fruit, flowers
and descriptive and statistical litera
ture.
finery was not -carried out. The Pro
motion Committee was met by Mayor
Thomas Renison and a delegation rep
resenting Salinas Cit^ and the local
Board of Trade. All the members ex
pressed themselves as heartily satis
fled with the excursion./

Sdwin and Arthur Peterson, sons of Mr.
Gecrsre Peterson, 2X52 Shattuck
Arc Berkeley, CaL
The above picture is of the two bright
little sons of Mr. Georpo Peterson, a
well-known shoe merchant cf 2162 Shat-
tuck Ave., Berkeley, CaL These two little
beys were being; made miserable by a ca-
tarrhal trouble that was affectlns; them
seriously. The Catarrh was affecting-
the nose, throat and chest, and it was
destroying their appetites and weaken-
lnjr them In every way. Mr. Peterson de-
cided that he would place both of his
children under the Electro-Chemic treat-
ment and they both Improved very rap-
Idly from the very start of it. Mr. Pe-
terson would bt very glad to tell any
parent interested in the Electro-Chemic
treatment Just what it did for his two
use little boys.
ELECTRO-CHEMIC SPECIALTIES.
The reason why the Electro-Chemic
treatment is fo popular with all patients
who have tak^n it is bpcauso the cura-
tive effects are so prompt. Right from
the very start of thp treatment the ma-
jority of cases show wonderful progress.
This is particularly so in Catarrh, Con-
sumption. Asthma, Bronchitis, Deafness,
Oisffisr Ears, Discharging- and Painful
Ear*. Diseases of the Stomach, Liver,
Kidneys and Bowels, Diseases of the
erervous System, Kheumatism. Xfeural-
rla. Locomotor Ataxla and Paralysis. In
special diseases of women, in those bad
cases in which no medical tr^atmrnt has
the least curative effect, the patient from
the very Btart of the Klectro-Chemip
treatment finds herpplf growing strong-
er and the pains in the back and in the
lower abdomen quickly disappear. The
bearinÂ«r-down sensation, the headaches,
sick stomach, the dizziness and awful
nervousness yield to the treatment from
the start. 'Misplaced Orgnss, Zrreg-ular-
lties, Tumors and Cancers are cured by
this wonderful treatment as by no othÂ«Â»r.
The most wonderful result of Electro-.
Chemistry in th*> treatment of diseases
jf women is the frequency with which it
rures patients that have bÂ«en advised by
Iheir family physicians to go to the sur-
teon for an operation. In special dln-
â¢a#es of men the results are equally
prompt and curative. Men who have
â¢ound no relief from any other treatment
ilnd that they can be quickly cured by
Slectro-Chrmistry of Weakness, Prosta-

the terms of the laws relating to the
degree of ability to perform manual
labor. Grosvenor declared that he
believed the country will approve of
the order and that also the soldiers of
the country will approve it and he
also expressed the belief that when
the deficiency bill is reported it will
contain an appropriation which will
be approved by a majority of the
House, to meet the additional increase
in the cost of pensions under the Pres

or bending of arms, legs or fingers in
such a way that the opponent cannot

The President has taken a few pre
liminary lessons himself and expects,
when time is available, to take more.
Meantime he has had the Navy De
partment send a letter to Superintend
ent Brownson of the Annapolis Naval
Academy, directing that Japanese ex
parts be employed to Introduce Jiujutsu

CALL BUREAU, HOTEL. BARTON,
WASHINGTON, April 9. â The art of
jlujutsu, a species of Japanese wrest

he has recommended that It bo taught

Special Dispatch to The Ca!l.
"I suppore your calm, neutral. Judi
cial-minded President would have
taken refuse behiod the constitution,
and would have done nothing. Not so,
thank God, with Theodore Roosevelt.
But for the President's action every
city in the country would have been
the .Â«cene of violence and rioting."
Spooner wondered that Gorman had
not attacked the President's record in
connection with the anthracite coal
strike in 1902. He dwelt on the bene
ncial result of his interference, and
added:
He charged the Democrats in both
houses with having adopted as a party
slogan the declaration that "Roose
velt must be beaten."
WHERE THE PEOPLE STAND.
"And I think," he said, "that, what
ever our friends on the other side of
the chamber may find to say of the
President, the great mass of the people
will agree with me that from the be
ginning he has shown that he will not
tolerate wrongdoing in any official,
high or low."
Spooner said it would have been im
possible for the Senate to make as
complete an investigation as Bristow
had made under the President's direc
tion.
Spooner paid a high tribute to Payne,
who, he said, had been unjustly ma
ligned more than any other official In
a number of years. Spooner put into
the record a letter from the President
to Payne commending him for the work
he had dene in connection with the
nostofnee investigation.
Speaking of the charges of corrup
tion, Spooner advanced the idea that
there is much less of it now than in
former years. He did not believe, for
instance, that a "credit mobilier" scan
dal would be possible in the Congress
of to-day.
Consideration of the postoffice bill
was then resumed and Spooner ad
dressed the Senate. He expressed the
opinion that much had been said con
cerning the postoffice situation for
partisan purposes and expressed sur
prise that Simmons, for instance
should have said that the Postoftice
Department inquiry was "reluctantly
begun."
URGES CAUTION IN SPEECH.
"What we sav here goes into the
permanent record," said Spooner. "If
we cast reflections upon any person
or official of the Government, they are
for all time. We are supposed to
speak from a high standard."
Continuing, he read from the Pres
ident's report on the investigation to
show that there had been no hesitancy
on the part of the officials of the Post
office Department to undertake the in
vestigation and declared that there
had been nothing in the record of the
department to impeach the fidelity of
the Postmaster General.
and 1880. and laid down the general
proposition that no treaty entered into
for mere temporary purposes could be
held to abrogate permanent treaties.
He again declared that unless there
was new legislation the country would
be without prohibitive legislation af
ter December T next.
Lodge then yielded to Patterson, to
make an addition to his speech of yes
terday on the Chinese exclusion act.
lie made especial reply to the conten
tion of other Senators that the treaty
with China of 1S9 4 had had the ef
fect of repealing the treaties of 1S6S
When the postoffice apropriatlon biil
was again taken up Lodge made a
statement covering the facts relating
to canceling machines used In the
Postonlce Department. Referring to
Eristow's report. Lodge said it might
be inferred from It that a large part
of the fund for machines had been
corruptly used, but this was not true,
as the expenditure was for additional
machines.
The bill for the aid of the Portland
exposition and the Philippine coastwise
shipping bill were passed finally by ao
cepting the House amendments.
1TXD NOT CORRUPTLY USED.
No progress was made on the post
c2!ce bill. The conference report on
the Ind!cn appropriation bill was par
tially read, but further consideration
was postponed on the suggestion that
the conferees had inserted provisions
that had net been passed on by either
house.
WASHINGTON, April 9. â In the Sen
ate to-day Spooner replied to tho
Democratic strictures on the conduct
of the Postofllce Department and also
traversed quite an extensive political
fle!d. He indorsed the course of the
Postmaster General in connection with
the Irregularities of his department
and charged that the effort on the part
of tha Democratic Senators to secure
a. Congressional Inquiry was in the In
terest of party politic*. He also de
fended the President against the
charge of violating: the lav.' which, he
said, had been made by the Democrats,
declaring that in nothing 'was the
President so much distinguished as In
his determination to enforce the law.

If this condition was hopeless, he
said, amid more Democratic applause,
"if we cannot rescue ourselves from
the degradation and decrepitude into
which we seem to be hurrying, then
we better leave the condition to be la-
In sarcastic vein he declared that the
President allowed Congress the privi
lege of declaring war, and he was
loudly applauded by the Democrats
when he added, "but the Presidfent
makes war when he chooses."
DIGNITY OF THE HOUSE.
After attacking what he declared to
be the President's usurpation of power
of interpretation, in which he said that
the order should not be retroactive,
Cockran appealed to members on both
sides to "consider the enormity of this
proposal," which he said affected the
liberty and safety of the Government.
In his opinion the steady decline in
the dignity of the House had attracted
much attention. :^ â¢Â¦
By one stroke of the pen, he declared,
the President had appropriated $6,000,
000, and he said it was a matter with
which Congress must deal if it has any
regard for its own powers or if it be
animated by a shadow of loyalty for
the constitution which created it. He
vigorously asserted that we are here
"at the parting of the ways," and in
quired that if this order be tolerated
without protest by the House, "what
power is there that the executive order
cannot usurp? What fragment of con
trol over the country's purse?"
Continuing, he said that this pretense
of interpretation of the law is but a
hollow mockery and play of words, and
added "it is known by the man who
wrote it, as is shown by the order it
self."
When Cockran began speaking he
was warmly applauded fcnd he at once
commanded the closest attention of
members of both sides of the House.
He said the resolution was offered sole
ly to vindicate the dignity of the
House. He did not, he said, question
the propriety of paying liberal pensions
to Federal soldiers, but he declared
that the basis of these payments should
be the laws of Congress and "not any
self-conrtituted authority." If, he said,
the President's order is recognized by
the House, "what fragment of power is
left to tne House?"
COCKRAX IS APPLAUDED.
The debate occurred on a resolution
introduced by Cockran directing the
Committee on the Judiciary to investi
gate the recent pension order. It had
been reported from the Committee, on
Rules with a recommendation that it
lie on the table, and this was adopted
by the narrow majority of three votes â
the Speaker having his vote recorded in
the affirmative. Three Republicans-
Messrs." Cushman of Washington, Lit
tlefield of Maine and McCall of Massa
chusettsâvoted with the. Democrats
against tabling the resolution.
The President and Secretary of the
Interior found warm supporters in
Dalzell, Grosvenor,' Gibson, Calderhead,
Lacey and. Hepburn. The first named
maintained that it made no difference
how many millions of dollars were in
volved in the President's order, because
the Secretary of the Interior distrib
uted the money voted by Congress pui
suant to the ruies of evidence estab
lished by the Pension Bureau.
Grosvenor believed that the country
and the old soldiers would approve the
order, and, that the money necessary
for putting it into effect would be in
cluded in the forthcoming deficiency
bill.
srrpoirr' the president.
WASHINGTON', April 9.â The reesnt
executive order of the President relat
ing to ajre as evidence of pensionable
disability to-day furnished the text
for an Impassioned appeal by AY.
T3ourke Cockran of New York to lha
memberr of the House to uphold the
dignity of that body by refusing to
submit to what he alleged to be the
usurpation of the legislative authority
of Conjrress by the executive.
In anticipation of Mr. Cockran's
epedeh almost even* sÂ«aÂ» "on the floor
was occupied and the galleries were
flllod to overflowing. Cockntn held his
Â«udiÂ«nr? throughout, end his remarks
frequently wore p\mctunted with loud
apnlauso from both sides of tho cham
ber. He characterized tho President's
interpretation of the lr.v.* as "hollow
mockery and a play of words," and
said that this was known by the man
who wrotÂ« it, ns Bhov.-n by the order
itself. I7Â«s declared that Congress, on
account of its pusillanimous failure to
do its duty to itself, had lost casteâ
so much so that the newspapers of the
country outside of Washington now
print only a paragraph or- two of its
proceedings. The action of the Presi
dent. hÂ«Â± aald, had been justified by tho
Secretary of the Interior by tho pre
cedent of Grover Cleveland. "But if
that be so, then in God's name let us
condemn that net of Cleveland's as
vehemently ap the act of any Republi
can President." The disposition to
justify everything "because Cleveland
did it." he said, was the highest com
pliment that could be paid to a man
by Congress: but the confidence which
Cleveland enjoys, he asserted, only
adds to the danger of the act, and does
not lessen it.
Dalzell, replying to Cockran, said he
could cite countless instances when the
House again and again had asserted
its right against the claims of the Sen
ate, and always successfully. It had,
he said, taken Cockran eleven years to
discover that there was an invasion
of the archives of the House. Con
cerning the pension order, Dalzell
maintained that it did not make any
difference how many millions were in
volved by â¢ the order. Congress, he
said, turned over to the Secretary of
the Interior a lump sum for pensions
based upon the Secretary's estimates,
to be distributed under the law -and
pursuant to the rules' of evidence of
the board by the Pension * Bureau.
Therefore, he argued, the amount of
money involved cut no figure in the
resolution under , discussion.
The President and Secretary, of the
Interior found another defender in
Grosvenor of Ohio, who said that they
He closed, amid a storm of applause,
by appealing to both sides of the
House to unite on a declaration of
rights "beyend which the aggression
of the Senate or of the executive shall
not go."
As Cockran took his seat he was
surrounded by members of both par
ties, who warmly congratulated him,
and it was some time before order was
DALZELIi MAKES REPLY.
He further attacked the rules of the
House, which, he said, forced members
to rise and discuss questions having no*
reference to the bill under considera
tion, "thus reducing the whole proceed
ing to the level of opera bS*jffe."
Reverting to the President's order,
Cockran contended that the Secretary
cf the Interior justified the action upon
the precedent of President Cleveland.
'.'Well, sir," he said, pacing up and
down the center aisle, "if that be so,
then in God'6 name let us condemn
that act of Mr. Cleveland's as vehe
mently as the act of any Republican
President. The disposition to justify
almost everything by pleading that
'Mr. Cleveland did it' is the highest of
compliments that can be paid to a man
by any Congress in our political his
tory."
Continuing, he' said: "You tell us
Mr. Cleveland did it, and therefore it
must be regular. If this act was com
mitted by Mr. Cleveland the confi
dence which he enjoys adds to its dan
ger and does not lessen it."
He attacked the rules of the House
and said that if the members were not
to be trusted "we ought to be abol
ished."
ATTACKS RULES OF HOUSE.
Raising his voice to a high pitch, he
said that the House "is the sanctuary
of our constitutional temple. We are
the priests to whom it is entrusted, and,
he added (pointing his finger at the
Speaker), "you, sir, are the high priest
responsible for the method in which
that trust shall be discharged."
He referred to attempts made by
England to usurp the legislative
authority and declared that the Presi
dent's order was the usurpation of
power, "not by appropriation, but by
interpretation," which he attributed to
the "pusillanimous failure of Congress
to do' its duty to itself."
Congress had control of the purse,
and if it would exercise that control, he
insisted, every privilege that belonged
to it would come back. He dwelt at
length on the inalienable right of the
House to originate revenue bills, and
urged the members to assert that right.
' He then Hayed the members for per
mitting the Senate to grow up at the
expense of the House, by persistently
asserting its rights. He charged that
ths House had been remiss In its duty
in not asserting its rights.
He received vociferous applause from
both sides of the chamber when he de
clared, notwithstanding Speaker Can
non^; . utterances, that public opinion
must come to the rescue of Congress,
"the public opinion of the United
States is here. We are its agents, its
creation."
merited rather than to be discussed."
Tears, he said, belonged to women
for conditions which were helpless,,
while discussion belonged to men. The
dignity and power of the House, he
maintained, were within the control of
its'own members, "and," he said," "it
nreds but loyalty on our part to restore
us not merely to an important, but to
a dominant position."
The Congress,, he declared, had so
lost casto that to-day. there was not a
pappr outeide of Washington that gave
more than one or two paragraphs
about its proceedings. In stentorian
tones he demanded to know "why has
thi3 decline come upon' us? Why has
this decrepitude overtaken us?"
Continuing, he inquired if it * were
possible that the House' must confess
now thnt its last Intrenchment has
been made "by a subordinate execu
tive officer," and said that the con
tempt v/hlch had been extended to the
House and the violation of its rights
constituted the measure of respect, at
tention and submission which it de
served. Amid an outburst of Demo
cratic epplause, he declared that when
the Ilou3e shall stand on its rights,
"the greater will be the security of
liberty and the wider the progress of
humanity." , . i

of the District Court at Council" Bluffs
in the case of ; James Boyle against
James F. Burns, president of the Port
land Mining: Company of Colorado, was
to-day reversed by the Iowa Supreme
Court. The decree of the lower court
gave Boyle $449,922, together with $8000
interest and $8000 costs. The case be
came famous by a suit filed in which
Boyle claimed nearly a million dollars
in payment for his interest in the Bob
tail, Tidal Wave and Devil'8 Own
claims, which form part of the Port
land company's properties. The suit
was instituted in 1898 and judgment
was rendered for $717,000, Burns per
mitting the suit to go by default. This
Judgment was later set aside, on show
ing made by Burns, after Boyle, who
was Mayor of Victor, Colo., had spent
six months in jail for contempt of
court, which had ordered him to dis
continue proceedings in Iowa, but

"That the Bureau of Immigration
should be the medium 1 of distributing
the aliens Is to my mind as much of a
duty as it is to decide to whom the
right to enter should be given."
"The question that individually and
vitally affects the interests of our peo
ple is: What shall we do with the
thousands that are admitted? Shall
they be allowed to form alien colonies
in our great cities, there to maintain
the false' ideas and to propagate , the
lawless views born thereof as the re
sult of their experiences, foreign, hot
alone geographically, but foreign as
v/ell to this country in their ideas of
human liberty and individual rights?
Immigration left thus is a menace to
the peace, good order and stability of
American institutions, which will
grow and increase with the genera
tions and finally burst forth in anar
chy and disorder. It is thus necessa
ry, as a measure of public security,
to advise and put into force same
means by which the alien arrivals
may be distributed throughout this
country and thus afford the opportu
nities by honest industry of securing
homes for themselves and their chil
dren.
"The Department of Commerce and
Labor, through the Bureau of Immi
gration, should, in my judgement, fur
nish information to all desirable
aliens as to the best locations for prof
itable means of earning a livelihood,
either as settlers, tradesmen or labor
ers. The States and Territories which
need immigration should file with the
department such* evidence of the ad
vantages offered to aliens to settle in
localities where conditions are favor

will be directed to the open and
sparsely settled country.

and Eastern Europe, which has taken
the place of Teutons and Celts. During
the past fiscal year nearly 600,000 of

On the question of Jurisdiction rais
ed by the defendants Judge Sloss de
cided-against them. They held that
as the Oroville Gold Dredging and
Exploration Company was incorporat
ed under the laws of Arizona, Califor
nia courts had no Jurisdiction over the
matter. I n connection with this point
Judge S!oss said: I
In the present case It appears that, although
tne company was Incorporated under th? laws

its reel property consists of minim lands In

it would be a mockery for this court to say
to the plaintiffs thnt it will not take' Jurisdiction
of their complaint, but that they must seek
their redress, U they are entitled to any. In the
courts of Arizona, where Jurisdiction could not
be obtained of any of the defendants (except
the corporation) unless they chose to make, a

ASK INJUNCTION.
The suit for the injunction was com
menced February 10 last, the plaintiffs
being John Hays Hammond, C. H. Mc-
Cormick, A. L. Ryerson, J. L. Hough
teling, E. A. Wiltsee, A. Cass Canfleld,
A. Chester Beatty, J. E. Doolittle and
F. B. Peabody. The defendants are F.
W. Bradley, president of the corpora
tion, and Directors W. R. Berry, Ed
win Schwab, W. C. Webb', A. Granger
and W. H. Crocker and Luther J. Hol
ton and J. W. Goodwin. The com
plaint contains the charge that Brad
ley mismanaged the affairs of the com
pany and that he and Crocker almost
continuously for several months orally
denounced the company's property as
worthless, and then, in order to secure
control of the property, caused to be
held what purported to be a directors'
meeting, at which authority was given
the directors to sell 40,000 shares of
stock standing in the name of the cor
poration. Of this stock 20,000 shares
were purchased by Bradley and 10,000
shares each by Goodwin and Holton at
$1 per share, a price, the plaintiffs al
leged, far below the value of the stock.
But it gave them the control of the
affairs of the concern, and, according
to the plaintiffs, worked a hardship
on the stockholders. They claimed that
before Goodwin and Holton were al
lowed to purchase the stock, the stock
holders, particularly the plaintiffs.
shou{d have been allowed to purchase
it. It was only, however, ac
cording to the evidence taken
at the hearing of the case

defendants made improvements upon
the property that did not meet with
the approval of Hammond and the oth
er plaintiffs,, but particularly Ham

the sale. .

Grewsonie Discovery Recalls
a Tragedy in the Seventies
and Confirms the Story of
Timber Owner's Partners
Speolal Dispatch to The Call
SAXTA CRUZ. April 9.â The finding
jf several coins and the skeleton of a
â¢nan has cleared urÂ» an old mystery at
Boulder Creek. In the fall of 1874
t man named Sims and two others who
ire now residents of Boulder, took
ap a timber claim where the town
noTT stands. Sims, who was the oldest
af the trio, was eccentric and subject
'.o fits of despondency. He was known
:o have considerable money, and car
ried ever 5600 in a leather belt.
One night when the men were seat
ed about the fireplace in their cabin
Sims suddenly sprang to his feet, and,
<\ith a wild cry, dashed from the build
ng and disappeared in the forest. It
was two days before his body was
found at the foot of a precipice at the
junction of Boulder Creek and the San
Lorenzo River.
The two living partners burled Sims
5n the bank of the creek, and. as they
were cut off from the outside world,
t was three weeks before communica
tion with the authorities was possible.
Meanwhile all trace of the grave had
Seen obliterated either by a landslide
nr a rise of the river. The money was
missing, and the partners of the dead
man incurred some suspicion, but al
ways vehemently protested that no
rrime had been committed.
Not until yesterday was their story
rompletely confirmed. Laborers for
:he S. II. Rambo Company, who were
excavating for the foundation for a
lumber yard along the banks of the
?reek. unearthed the human bones and
rivets from a belt. It is stated that
f500 was found and turned over to the
surviving partners.

The legal struggle for the* control of
the OroWlIe Gold Dredging and Ex
ploration Company, which was inaug
urated some months ago by tho filing
of a suit for an injunction restraining
certain of the directors of the corpo
ration from voting 40.000 shares of
stock alleged to have been Illegally
Issued, terminated" yesterday in Judgo
Sloss' court, when an order was made
refusing the injunction and dismissing
the order to show cause upon which
the alleged conspirators were haled
into court. In an opinion handed
down by Judge Sloss in the matter he
held that the showing made by the
plaintiffs In the action did not war
rant the issuance of the injunction be
cause it was shown that the acts of
F. W. Bradley, the alleged arch con
spirator, and his fellow alleged con
spirators, J. W. Goodwin and L. J.
Holton. were known to a majority of
the directors; that when the first
steps were taken which culminated in
the issue of the disputed shares the
defendants had the apparent control;
that the design of Goodwin to obtain
control had been, for some month?,
known to many if not all of the plain
tiffs and had been approved by some
of them, and that no intimation had
ever been given to him or oÂ»y of the
defendants that such design was dis
tasteful to any of the stockholders.
The court said at the outset of Its
opinion: ,

who have apparently In good faith parted with
J20.000 in exchanre for this stock, of one of
the mort important attributes of its ownership.
An injunction should not be granted where the
complainant's rlÂ«ht is doubtful. So far as the
question of motive is concerned, the plaintiff's
case is not, in my Judgment, sufficiently clear
to warrant the granting of the relief sought.
RIGHT TO STOCK.
Judge Sloss also decided against the
plaintiffs on their claim that stock
holders in a corporation have a prior
right to stock in the concern which Is
placed upon the market or is offered
for sale. He holds that the stock
holders have a prior right to stock
where it is issued as a result of an
increase in the capital stock, but that
this right of pre-emption does not ap
ply to stock issued from the original
authorized capital.
On this important point, decided for
the first time in this State, Judge Sloss
says :
"The rule is well established that
'those who are shareholders when an
increase of capital stock is effected
enjoy the right to subscribe to the new
stock In proportion to their original
holdings and before subscriptions may
be received from outsiders.' (26 Am. and
Eng. Ency Law, 2d Ed., 947). The con
tention of the defendants is that this
right of pre-emption, so called, applies
only where there has been an increase
of stock beyond the amount original
ly authorized by the charter articles of
incorporation; that of the plaintiffs
that it applies to all issues of stock
not theretofore issued, whether a part
of the originally authorized capital (as
here) or not.
"On this point the authorities are not
in harmony. The true rule, I think,
is to be ascertained by a consideration
of the reason upon which the doctrine
is based. It is argued by the learned
counsel for plaintiffs â and no doubt
correctly â that the right of pre-emp
tion, to whatever extent it may exist,
restB upon the ground that the owner
ship of shares of stock carries with it
* _ +
not only tho right to receive such divi
dends as may be declared, but also a
voice in the election of directors, and,
consequently, in the control and man
agement of the corporation; that the
extent of the influence of the stockhold
er depends upon the proportion which
his stock bears to the total stock is
nued; and that he has a right to pre
serve that proporionate voice and in
fluence if he sees fit; or, in other words,
that the directors should not, by an is
sue df new stock, be permitted to dis
turb the relative standing of the stock
holdprs without their consent.
"That this reasoning Is applicable
to the case of an increase of the cap
ital stock of a corporation beyond the
amount originally authorized is ob
vious. Where a corporation is formed
with a capital of 100,000 shares and A
subscribes for and obtains 40,000
shares, his part in the control is two
fifths. He can, under the system of
cumulative voting, elect two of five di
rectors*. In any event, he can, by
combining with a trifle more than one
tenth of the remaining stock, name a
majority of the board. If then steps
are taken to increase the capital stock
from 100,000 to 200,000 shares and
the directors Issue the additional 100,
000 to persons other than A, without
giving him an opportunity to subscribe
for any part of the increased issue, it
is plain that his influence in the man
agement of the corporation is greatly
reduced. Instead of holding two
fifths of the stock outstanding, his
proportionate holding becomes only
one-fifth.
THE GENERAL* RULE.
"Does the same line of reasoning
apply to a portion of the originally
authorized capital, which may remain
unissued? I think it does not If a
corporation is organized with a nom
inal capital of 100,000 shares, and A
subscribes for 10,000 shares he does
so knowing that others may subscribe
for some part or all of the 90,000
shares remaining. Indeed, he has a
right to insist that all of the remain
ing authorized capital shall be sub
scribed before he can be called on to
pay for his stock. This is the general
rule, except in so far as it may have
been modified by statute (26 Am. and
Eng. Ency. Law, second edition, 934;
Civil Code of Cal, sec. 331, San Ber
nardino Ins. Co. vs. Merrill, 108 Cal.,
4 90), and no statute of Arizona mak
ing any modification of it has been
called to my attention.
"The taking of the remaining stock
by others is an implied condition up
on which the subscription shall be
come binding. The subscriber may
waive the condition, and take his
stock before the balance has been sub
scribed. But how can it be said that
by waiving this condition he acquires
a new right entirely inconsistent with
it, namely, the right to have a defi
nite proportion of the remaining
stock Issued to him? The contention
of the plaintiffs would lead to the re
sult that the first subscriber or sub
scribers to the stock of a corporation
could prevent the issue of any further
stock except to 'himself or themselves.
To recur to the illustration given
above, where A subscribes for 10,000
shares in a corporation having a nom-
"The character of these arriving

differs greatly from that of 1882 and
the years previous. Since the founda

the past fifteen years practically all

Scandinavian countries, and were very
largely of Teutonic stock, with a large
percentage of Celtic. Fifteen millions

"No question of public policy is of
greater Importance or affects so close
ly the interests of the people of this
country for the time present and to
come as that of immigration. It pre
sents both a practical and a senti

physically and mentally diseased, the
shiftless and all those who are induced
to leave their own country not by
their own independent volition and
their own natural ambition to seek a
larger and more promising field of in

some selfish scheme, devised to take
undue advantage of some classes of our
own people, or for other improper pur
poses. Such a policy is a wise one, as
well as obligatory upon the Govern

"The university graduates are large
ly required in the high schools, and
with the rapid Increase in the number
of school children in the State of Cali
fornia it would seem to be our duty
to encourage the attendance at normal
schools and to place the standard of
graduation at a high mark."
"Universities and normal schools
ought to produce our best teachers,
and it is to the interest of the State
that the best equipped teachers possi
ble be supplied for the elementary pub
lic schools.

That San Francisco has again shown
itself to be a splendid "show town" is
evidenced by the enormous crowds that
have been attracted to the Mechanics'
Pavllio-n the last week to see the Nor
ris & Rowe circus. It is estimated
that 64,000 people paid to see the shows,
which gave the best of satisfaction.
Norris & Rowe are California people.
They winter in San Jose and the money
they make here is all spent here. Dur
ing the last winter some $30,000 was
expended in improving the circus and
this money was all expended in San
Jose and San Francisco. This season
the energetic young managers deter
mined to have a real cfrcus, in addi
tion to their trained animal shows, and
that they succeeded is shown by the
excellent performances and the display
of wild animals made. during the pres
ent engagement. Mechanics' Pavilion
was transformed into a Madison Square
Garden and the scene3 of the Barnum
& Bailey shows were duplicated here^
Society turned out in force during the
week and there was a profusion of
smartly gowned, women ' and dress T
coated men to see. the circus.
the week Norris & Rowe had
as their guests the pupils of the va
rious charitable organizations, the deaf
and dumb classes of the public schools,
the kindergartens and orphan asylums.
The little ones were; delighted with the
many wonders of the big show and the
pleasure of the little ones and the circus
owners was' mutual, jj
Next week will see the circus under

Oakland and the surrounding towns.
The Norris & Rowe shows will .be
warmly welcomed upon their return in

AT VARIOUS CHURCHES
Your committee are of the opinion that it
would be quite unnecessary to present any
arguments In favor of the law or Its enforce
ment as it exists in the statute books. It la
the law.
A motion that the joint board rec-
It if possible that some member of this
board may have assumed that the law as
enacted refers solely to the public or common
schools of this Siate. such being specifically
mentioned in the act.
The Htate c-onÂ«titution. however, defines the
public school Â»>-stem in article IX, section <5, to
"include primary and grammar schools and
such high school*, evening schools. Normal
Fchools and technical schools as may be estab
lished by the Legislature or by municipal or
district authority." The legislative enactment
relating to vaccination is unquestionably man
datory in U* terms and character and the
duty of enforcing Its provisions devolve* not
only upon the trustees of district schools and
Boards of Education of the various cities and
towns of the State, but upon this Joint board
of State Normal schools as well, as shown
by the constitutional provision defining thÂ«
public schools of California. It may be fur
ther added in this connection that section 772
of the Tenal Code provide* that any officer
under the Jurisdiction of the court who has
refused or neglected to perform the duties
pertaining to his office- murt be cited to appear
before said court, and if in the hearing such
charge is crustained the court must enter a
decree that the party accused be deprived of
his cf9cÂ« and must enter a judgment for $500
In favor of the Informer and such costs as are
itllowed In civil cases."
Ontlemen: Tour committee to whom was
referred the resolution relating to vaccination
haw carefully examined the law relating to
the subject and beg leare to report as follows:
The law enacted by the Legislature and ap
proved February 20. 188ft. which Is known as
the â¢â¢vaccination act. 1 " recites that: "ThÂ«
trustees of the several common school districts
In this St^te and Hoard of Common School
Government in the several cities and towns
are directed to exc.ludo from the benefits of the
I common school therein any child or person
j who has not been vaccinated until such tini"?
i when said child or person shall be euecess-
J fully vaccinated, etc."
That the chairman or the joint board ap-
I point a comnllti* of three normal school
i m*n to confer with the proper authorities or
! the two universities upon plans for th* co
i operation or universities and normal 6cnoo.s
1 in the training of teachers within the lines of
Â¦ the report submitted en euch co-operaton or
other lines as may be eUKirested.
That the chairman or this board appoint
two normal school men to act aÂ» a commit
tee- on general programme and arrangementa.
Mid two members of the committee to have
power to select a co-worker irom each or the
universities and the committee or four as a
whole to have power to arrange a programme
and fix the exact time for the first convening
Â«>ome time early in the coming school year
during the school term.
That this Joint board urge the normal facul
ties tÂ» attend such convention of universities,
normal schools and colleges and recommend
' local boards to gTant them permission to at
tend.
Dr. Ward read the following report
relative to vaccination in the normal
schools, a subject that has caused con
siderable agitation in the past:
VACCINATION* REPORT.
Governor Pardee maintained that, ac
j cording to Dr. Thorpe's idea, it was
| the intention to make the normal
j schools a supplementary echool to the
I university and to make them schools
I cf culture rather than schools of in
; struction in the art of teaching. The
! adoption of the minimum requirements
I for graduation from the normal schools
! leaves the Lob Angeles Trustees free
to try their experiment as long as the
minimum standard is reached.
The following motions were made by
| Mr. Van Liew and unanimously car
1 ried:
of the scholarship to be increased so
that the doors of the university would
open to the school. It was desired to
do this, as experience, he said, dictated
that the graduates from the normal
schools should go forth as well equip
ped as possible to teach.
"Comparatively few of the young men
and women who graduate at the high
Â§chools take the normal school course.
Particularly is this true of young men,
as during the last year only four In
the entire State entered the normal
school after having graduated at* a
California high school.
"One reason for this Is that the re
muneration received by teachers Is not
sufficient to induce the young men to
enter that field of activity.
"Professor Burke has collected data
upon the salaries of 708 men out of
the 7S8 teaching in the State. Six hun
dred and three, or 77 per cent, of these
are receiving $1000 or less per year.
Fifty-five per â¢ cent are receiving . less
than fSOO.
"There are only 116 teachers, accord
ing to reports of County Superintend
ents, nc/w unemployed in the State; and
omitting San Francisco, of which no
estimate can be made, and Butte and
Tuolumne counties, not heard from,
thirty-two counties report no unem
ployed teachers, seventeen report three
or less and eighty-six of the unem
ployed are distributed In Alameda, Los
Angeles, Nevada, Siskiyou and Santa
Clara counties.
Chairman M. E. Dailey of the com
mittee on textbooks filed a list of books
decided upon for use in the State nor
mal schools, which was adopted. The
committee on legislation presented a
voluminous report of particular inter
est. It recites in brief that there are
1462 students enrolled In the normal
schools and 552 graduates. The de
mand for teachers in the State reaches
1200 annually, ieaving a deficiency of
more than BOO to be met from immi
gration and examination. The report
says :
ommend to the committee on co-opera
tion of the Normal schools and univer
sities to report on the status of train
ing teachers in both institutions from
the standpoint of both culture and
practice was adopted.

A motion was finally made and unan
imously carried that It was the sense

Following Mr. Dockweiler. a number
of others gave their views Â«>n the sub

occasion to make a most pertinent re
mark. He declared it was his belief
that the normal schools should be res

nual meeting of the Joint Board of
Stata Normal School Trustees came
to an end yesterday afternoon. That
thÂ« s*therins this rear has been
the most successful of any
heretofore held is generally ad
mitted and the discussion of
the various subjects of vital import
ance to the normal schools of the
State has been productive of much
good. Considerable business of im
portance was transacted, the most im
portant action being the abolition of
kindergarten training departments in
all of the normal schools except Los
Angeles.
During the discussion on â¢"Kinder
garten Instruction and Kindergarten
Departments of Normal Schools,"
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of
the University of California took oc
casion to say: "The place to educate
the child is in the home by the
mother, but in the decay of the home
in the thickly' settled districts the
kindergarten is of great value to the
children of the slums, who cannot
have the training of the play instincts.
We should have kindergartens in the
slums and the teachers should be
trained In the normal schools, but in
my opinion xre should have a course, of
instruction in one school and not in
five. There should be kindergartens
in the San Francisco School Depart
ment in certain districts where the
children are neglected by the parents."

ARMY TRL\LS.
An Infantryman's Lions Sirgc.
This eoldier's tale of food Is interest-
ing. A
During: his term of service in the
Seventeenth Infantry in Cuba and the
Philippines an Ohio soldier boy con-
tracted a disease of the stomach and
bowels which all army doctors who
treated him pronounced incurable, but
which Grape-Nuts food alone cured:
"In October, 1S99. when my enlistment
expired. I was discharged from the
army at Calulute, Philippines, and re-
turned to the States on the first avail-
able steamer that left Manila. When
I got home I was a total wreck phy-
sically and my doctor put me to bed
saying he considered me the wor^t
broken-down man of my age he ever
fjÂ»\v and after treating rrie six months
he considered my case beyond medical
aid.
â¢"During the fall and winter of 1300
and 1901 I was admitted to the Barnes
Hospital in Washington, D. C. f jr
treatment for chronic inflammation of
the stomach and bowels, but after flvÂ«:
months returned home as bad as ever.
"I continued taking medicine until
February, 1902. when reading a news-
paper one day I reaxl about Grape-Nuts
and was so impressed I sent out for a
package right away.
"The result Is quickly told, for I have
used Grape-Nuts continually ever since
with the beet results: my health Is so I
can do a fair day's hard work, stomach
and bowels are in good condition, have
pained forty pounds In weight and I
fe*>! like a new man altogether.
"I owe my present good health to
Grape-Nuts beyond all doubt, for med-
ical science was exhausted." Name
given by Postum Co., Battle Creek.

Had b*Â» consulted any one of several
thousand physicians we know of they
would have prescribed Grape-Nuts Im-
mediately.

FOUR YOUXG BOYS ROB
HOME OF A RECLUSE
Secure $12,000, but Most of the Money
Is Recovered When They Are
Taken Into Custody.
WATERBURY. Conn., April 9.âFour
boys suspected of connection with the
robbery in Lanesville, Conn., when
$12,000 was stolen from the home of
Henry Davis, a recluse, were arrested
to-day. About $8000 was found in their
possession. All the boys are under 20
years of age. John Turner, 15 years
old, arrested at New Milford, charged
with complicity in the robbery, is said
to have made a full confession, taking
the officers to Brookfleld Junction,
where they found 51200 hidden under a
stone wall. All the boys are members
of respectable families.
Casey was taken to the Seventeenth
street police station and charged with
murder. He enjoys the reputation of
being a peaceful, law-abiding citizen
and is well liked in the Bernal Heights
district.
McNamee was 23 years old. He is
well known to the police and was con
sidered a dissolute character, quarreN
some and vicious.
William McNamee, a carpenter, 23
years of age, was shot and instantly
killed shortly after 8 o'clock last night
by William Casey, proprietor of a gro
cery and saloon at 521 Cortland ave
r.ue. The killing was the result of a
quarrel, and Casey says he fired the
fatal shot in self defense. He occupies
a cell at the Seven'teenth-street sta
tion. He is charged with murder.
There were several eye witnesses to
the tragedy, and they all corroborate
the statement made by Casey. Mc-
Namee entered the barroom of the
place shortly after 8 o'clock and en
gaged in a wordy row with Casey, who
ordered him out of the place and cau
tioned him not to return.
McNamee left reluctantly, muttering
as he walked away. He returned,
however, in about half an hour, and
this time started in to wreck the sa
loon. Casey jumped from behind the
bar and grabbed a club and started to
beat McNamee on the head.
He finally dropped the weapon and
the men engaged in a fist fight. They
were roughing it for several minutes
and Casey seemed to be getting the
better of the argument when McNamse
left the place.
He stepped inside the door a moment
later and made a rush at Casey, at
the same time making a motion as if
io draw a pistol from his back pocket.
<7asey pulled his revolver and fired
three shots at McNamee. The latter
fell dead on the floor. A bullet had
entered his left breast, near the heart.
Victor E. Rhodin of Stockholm, a
commissioner from the insurance
companies of . Sweden, arrived here
yesterday from the East and is regis
tered at the St. Francis. According
to the visitor, the purpose of his tour
of this country is to inspject conditions
in so far as they apply to insurance
risks, and particularly to those risks
assumed by the companies oLSweden,
which have been doing a large busi
ness in the United States, but at a
loss. Discussing this subject he said:
"Few of the ordinary insurers in
this country realize the great amount
of reassurance done by foreign com
panies, but it is very large, and, owing
to a number of recent big fires in the
United States, the losses have been in
excess of anything anticipated. The
fire 'n Baltimore two months ago was
a disastrous one for our companies
and it was immediately after this un
fortunate conflagration, that I was
sent over here to study your condi
tions. I have visited nearly all your
big cities in the East and from here
I visit the cities of the Middle West,
including St. Louis and Chicago. In
Chicago our risks are very large and
for that reason I am anxious to de
vote considerable time there."
Ithod'n's tour of inspection sa far
has not favorably impressed him with
the conditions of safety that , exist
here. After visiting New York,' 'Buf
falo, Rochester, Baltimore and Phila
delphia he arrived at the opinion that
a fire fa!milar to the recent one in Bal
timore may occur in any of the other
cities mentioned at any time and re
sult In as great a loss. This condition
of affairs he attributes, to what ap
pears to l^m to be lack of stringent
laws regulating the construction . of
buiJdings, and upon this subject he
says'*
"The laws of the majority of the
cities- in this country that I have vis
ited do not favorably compare .with
those of foreign cities. My own coun
try is so small that it would not be
fair to use it as a comparison, but say
you take London as an example.
There you will find very few buildings
over four -stories in height and most
of them are two *or three in height.
Even the largest do not rise over six
or seven stories, and particular atten
tion is given to facilities for fighting
fires. In this comparison, of course. I
do not include fire departments, for I
must admit that the department? of
the United States, so far as I have
seen, are ! remarkably good, â¢ but I re
fer^ to the conditions surrounding the
buildings.
"In London it. is a municipal re
quirement that streets of a certain di
mension shall have buildings of a cer-

tain dimension, in order that firemen
shall have sufficient room for fight
ing fires from the streets as well as
the sides of the structures. In this
country the buildings abut each other
so that it is possible" to combat, a
fire from only one side, generally the
street. There are also other condi
tions that tend to make fire insurance
rates on the other side of the Atlantic
lower than in this country.
"According to our statistics America
has more disastrous fires than any other
country in the "world, and naturally
the uncertainty of the earning power
of insurance capital in America makes
the country undesirable to insurance
capital in foreign lands and is

lor's court yesterday, but when the
case was called Attorney W. D. Grady
filed affidavits by himself, the de
fendant and Attorney H. W. Bradley
and asked for a continuance.-
The affidavits of Grady and the de
fendant recited the facts that Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Coit was a material and
necessary witness for the defense, as
she could prove among other things
that at the time the deceased was at
tempting to take the revolver from the

Two men sustained injuries that
may result fatally and two more were
seriously injured by the falling of a
painter's "swing" in the rear of the
Palace Hotel yesterday afternoon.
Con Gunderson, who resides at S3
Clementina street, was treated at the
Harbor Hospital for a fractured skull,
two fractured ribs, extensive internal
Injuries, contusions of the chest, right
elbow and both hips. C. A. Bort. liv
ing at 758 Howard street, suffered a
dislocation and fracture of the right
hipbone, internal injuries and a deep
laceration over the. right eye. Both
may die. John Cole of 434 Minna
street suffered from shock and 'deep
cuts on the left hand and Joseph
J-amieson of 416 Turk street was treat
ed for a serious contusion of the left
hip.
The accident was caused by over
weighting the "swing." At the time
it happened there were six men on the
planking and the strain. was too great.
The center rope, which is held in po
sition on the roof, "snapped and the
swing broke in the center. The four
men that were injured were pitched Xp
the sidewalk, thirty-flve feet below,
but the two others, N. Spencer of 909
Ke'arny street and C. Peterson of 118
Sixth street, clung to the""two outer
ropes and landed safely.
The painters were working on the
Jessie-street side of the Palace Hotel
and had painted the building from the
roof down to the first story. Three of
them were on the sv.ing and three
more stood on a fire escape.*; Prepara
tory to moving their appartus the
three men that were on the. fire escape
climbed intothe swing that they might
be lowered to the - ground. Peterson
and Spencer released the end ropes
and Bort had charge of the center.*
When an attempt was made" to de
scend the center rope was .heard . to
snap,, the. planking broke in two and
the four unfortunate men plunged to
the sidewalk.
All of the > men were . employed by
John Quardt, who, has the contract for
painting- ;the. hotel. ,

Th? tone of the local realty market
is buoyant. The character of the deals
has changed materially In a few
months. The situation is thisâ the
buyers of medium sized properties now
have the greater number of sales
credited to their account. These facts
have been frequently mentioned of late
:n thcte columns. The San FrJtncisco
Heal Estate Circular for the current
month says: "The investor of small
means is now seeking income-paying
j.rcperties, from 57500 to 515.000, and
the homeseeker with $100!) to 52000 to
s-;tnd for a home Is buying." Prob
ably the modest limit placed In the
foregoing by the Real Estate Circular
could safely be raised somewhat, al
though in a general way the situation
is about as described. There Is money
enough in the city to cover the entire
peninsula with buildings If the inhabi
tants wcrÂ« so minded. The Bank
Commissioners report that the deposits
Ln the savir.^s banks of this city alone
amounted to more than 5160,000,000
last year. About 50 per cent of the
savings bank dei>osits are loaned on
real estate, the exact figures being at

tâ 1 ORESTERS and"climatologists in this country will
rH be surprised at the action of the German Meteor
â¢*Â¦ ological Society in its report upon the influence of
forests upon climate. Without the full text of the report
it may be easy to make mistakes in discussing Jt. But,
a Berlin telegram says that its conclusion is that for
ests have no appreciable effect upon climate. Without
knowing just what is included in the term "climate," one
is somewhat in the dark as to the full meaning of the re
port. It is stated that observations of temperature and
humidity, taken in the forests and clearings of Branden
burg, a*nd at remote points therefrom, justify the con
clusion that forests do not affect climate, and that like
observations in the marshes of Russia confirm this.
The diagrams and tables accompanying the report
are to be shown as an exhibit at the St. Louis Exposi
tion. Taking the report to be as stated in the Berlin
telegram, the examination of the subject is incomplete.
It has jiot been contended that forests create humidity,
but they conserve it. Against this it was formerly
pointed out that humidity in the prairie States existed
without the influence of forests. This was for a long
time supposed to negative the claims of the foresters
that trees affect humidity. But the experience of years
has proved that nature provided water storage and con
servation on the treeless prairies, in the form of sloughs,
swamps, ponds and lakes. These reservoirs caught and
held the rainfall, and evaporation carried the moisture in
to the air, to be distributed by the thunder showers com
mon to all that region.
In the progress of settlement these natural reservoirs
have been drained for cultivation, and it is (discovered
that the climate has become more arid. The precipitation
of moisture in the late fall and winter and early spring
goes on undiminished. It comes from the great lakes. But,
the reservoirs which originally stored it being destroyed,
it runs into the'drainagc channels and gravity carries it
away, increasing the Hoods in the Mississippi River and
its tributaries. Not being stored, the summer humidity
is decreased, the water is not distributed to the soil by
the summer showers, andthe crust of the earth is drying
out. It takes more original precipitation to do the work
than formerly. There are seasons in which the moisture
from the great lakes is unusual in quantity when the
ground is unfrozen, and it is saturated sufficiently to
avoid drought. But the main problem remains, caused
by draining the natural reservoirs.
No one has ever contended that the annual- rainfall
of California is caused by the forests.. Its source is the.
moisture evaporated from the Japan current, the evap
oration being caused by difference in temperature be-"
twecn the air and the surface of that ocean stream. If
the Sierra Nevada range were a bare granite wall the
State would receive the same rainfall as "now. But the
results would be very different. The water would all
run off, as. from a roof, as fast as it falls. The creeks
and rivers would all be torrents, and when the rain
ceased, would immediately dry up, and the water would
all be back in the ocean.
It is demonstrated that stripping the mountains of the
forests that clothe them, and "o'estroyingthe lesser vege
tation by grazing or by fire, produce exactly the same
results as if they had always been naked rock. The for
ests conserve the moisture. By their agency it pene
trates, thesoil and slowly finds its way into the creeks
and springs and through 1 .them' into the rivers, preserving
a steady run off and supplying the means of Â¦irrigation to
make valley lands fertile. If., the German experi
ments deny this function to the forests, we" must assume
FORESTS AND CLIMATE.
Our worthy Board of Supervisors, with incongruous
gravity, is investigating the "amateur" prize-fighting
clubs which are lining their coffers with easily earned
money and are breeding dangerous .men out of vicious
boys. The evil which the Supervisors are solemnly dis
cussing has become so widespread and so corrupting in
its influence upon the youth of San Francisco as to be
come a serious public menace. Public opinion if not
public authority should stop it at once. '
The greatest of modern ice-breakers
is the Ermack. built originally for use
in the Baltic, but also occasionally em
ployed elsewhere. This vessel Is SS5
feet long, 71 feet beam and 8000 tons
displacement, with a draught of 22
feet. She was originally fitted with a
bow propeller as well as twin screws
at the etern, this propeller, with its In
dependent engine, being intended to
aid in breaking up the ice. The bow
propeller was found useful for
year-old ice, but became- choked ] and
useless in polar field ice, and hence
was removed before the vessel , was
sent to the Arctic. In solid ice two
feet thick, with six to twelve inches
of enow on top of it, the Ermack can
make a speed of nine knots, while she
can charge and demolish packs of ice
twenty to; thirty- five feet in thickness.
Especial interest attaches at the
The large modern ice-breakers de
pend for their efficiency upon their
ability to ride up upon the ice and
break down the edge of the sheet by
sheer weight, thus "biting" their way
through the sheet. Such action re
quires that the hull shall be con
structed with the greatest possible
stiffness, the vessel being subjected to
stresses which would break an ordi
nary ship in two. With this great
strength there must be ample power,
the combination of the two being
needed to oppose the heavy resist
ances. Vessel? of this kind are now
in active service in Copenhagen, Kiel,
Riga, Stockholm, Amsterdam and
other ports, besides many small boats
used as postboats and pilot-boats in
the Baltic, the German coast and the
Black Sea. A typical example of the
boats used in general service is found
in the Sampo, operating in the port
of Hango. in Finland. This vessel,
which was built on the Tyne, has a
propeller at each end. the bow engine
having 1200 horsepower and the stern
engine 1350 horsepovter. She is 202
feet long and 2000 tons displacement,
with a full draught of eighteen feet.
This boat breaks through field ,ice
twelve to sixteen inches thick lit a
speed of eight knots and she can work
through drift Ice eight to ten feet
thick at a rate of two to three knots,
alsÂ«o breaking down larger packs with
out much trouble.
At the hearing before the New York
State Senate Committee on Miscel
laneous Corporations at Albany on the
bill to increase the water rights of the
Niagara. Lockport and Ontario Power
Company, Charles M. Dow, president
of the Board of Commissioners of the
State reservation at Niagara, vigor
ously objected to the measure. Among
other renur*â . he said: "Owinsr to
the greater declivity of the river bed
on the Canadian side, as well as the
wider expanse of the Horseshoe Fall,
It is estimated that only one-fifth of
the whole volume of the river passes
over the American fall. Furthermore,
owing to the difference in elevation
of the Canadian and American river
beds, the American fall is the first
10 show the effect of any subtraction
of water from the river above. As
the genera! depth of the water on the
fall is only about four feet, and as the
elevation of the American fall is some
thing like six or seven feet above that
of the Canadian fall, it is apparent
that the American fall might be
made entirely dry while water still
poured over the Canadian fall. That
such a discrepancy would appear in
the event of the diversion of a suf
ficient amount of water is not simply
a theory; the fact was demonstrated
in 184 S. when the flow of the river was
diminished by an ice blockade at the
foot of Lake Erie, and ou__a lesser
scale by more recent ice gorges.
"From the foregoing It will appear
that the diversion of 20 per cent of the
v.ater of Niagara River would be suf
ficient to render the American fall as
dry as the once famous cataract of
Lodore in England. Now, let us see
what the State has already done to ac
complish such a disastrous result: The
reservation had hardly been created,
for the express purpose of preserving
the scenery of the falls, when the Leg
islature began, with singular inconsis
tency, to give away gratuitously the
very water upon which the existence of
the fall depends. Seven corporations
were granted charters to take water
from the Niagara River, between 18S6
and 1894, besides another corporatiou
which is taking water without author
ity, making eight American corpora
tions which have either been authorized
or are taking water without authority
frcm the river. There are two Can
adian corporations, for which the New
York Legislature is not responsible, of
course, but the effect of whose opera
tions ur>on the flow of the falls must
be reckoned with.
"Some of these corporations are lim
ited in the amount of water which they
can divert. More are unlimited. One
limited American company alone is au
thorized to develop 200.000 horsepower,
requiring 6 per cent of the volume of
the river. With a similar development
by Its corresponding company on the
Canadian side the flow of the river will
be diminished about one-eighthâsuffi
cient to dry up the American fall, ac
cording to one estimate. A similar de
velopment by all of the companies in
existence would rob Niagara of one
third of its volume and insure the ob
literation of the American fall beyond
a peradventure."â Electric World 1 and

CHICAGO has just voted again in favor of. muni
cipal ownership and operation of the street-rail
ways. This vote is at a time when Chicago Jias
entirely failed in the essentials of a city government.
The city is practically bankrupt. The streets are like
over-ground sewers, and filthy beyond belief. The police
are inefficient and insubordinate. Mobs destroy life and
property in broad daylight, and maltreat working women
as they leave their place of employment for their, homes.
The cry of good citizenship in that city -is for the proper
administration of its present duties by the municipal
government, and not for the assumption of duties that
do not belong to a political government at all.
The city runs the water works, and the first thing a
stranger reads in the morning papers is a warning by the
Board of Health not to the use the water, as it is danger
ous. The school children are compelled by the- health
regulations to carry their supply of boiled water for
drinking to the schoolhouse in bottles. That being the
situation in that great city, instead of putting its rev
enue and its energies into the proper discharge of the
existing duties of its government, 130,000 of its people
vote to leave all undone that should be done, in order to
assume the doing of more.
â¢ Mayor Harrison, for personal political purposes, pro
moted the public ownership idea, but seems to have been
sobered by the result, for he says it should be a future
and not a present policy, and the vote is due t,o the ignor
ance and misinformation of the people.
The foreign exceeds the native population, and is very
largely socialistic in its views. The socialists were ac
tive in promoting the vote, while those who. oppose the
plan were, as usual, idle or indifferent.
Thinking Americans are repelled from all schemes for
putting government into business by the history of the
management of the postal business by the Federal Gov
ernment. More reasons can be given for the Govern*
ment going into the business of carrying letters than for
embarking in any other kind of business. Yet it has* al
ways shown itself incompetent and incapable in perform
ing that function. What final sovereignty has failed td
do cannot be hoped for if undertaken by a municipality.
We do not know what the government of Chicago
proposes to do under instruction of the recent vote. If
it take over the street railroad system, it must borrow
millions fo* that purpose, and following the usual course
in such experiments, the bonds will be made a lien upon
the general fund, absorbing the credit that should be
used in purifying the water and cleansing the sewer-like
streets. The future proceedings of the city will be
watched with interest.

Dr. Guillaune has made a special al
loy to correct the unrest of naval
chronometers ,by the medium defect of
temperature. Such a chronometer, re
cently tested at the observatory at
Kew, near London, had only a devia
tion of .18 of a second per day,* and
fpr an increase of temperature of one
degree Fahrenheit each the deviation
was only .004 of a second per day more.
That pendulums of invar, j therefore,
roust excel by their unchangeable and
even swings is self-evident, and the
tests made at the same observatory
have demonstrated that even in dif
ferences of temperature of 18 degrees
Cel. simple pendulums of Invar rods
showed only a deviation of .2 of a sec
ond per day. It has to be added that
these pendulums had no equalizing at
tachments," but consisted only of rods.
' " T ith the?e examples the number of
uses of invar Is certainly not at all
exhausted, and undoubtedly many- more
will yet be found.â Frankfort News.
The importance of this invention is
extraordinary. For scientific as well
as for practical purposes, measuring in
struments of invar, as the inventor
calls the new alloy, will render most su
perior services. Already objects fer
tropical surveys have been made of It.
Such measurements always suffered
from certain inaccuracies, owing to the
expansion of the metals in the heat, and
required numerous - remeasurements.
Measuring sticks for laboratories, as
well as . for official gauging, are also
to be n*a\le of this new alloy.
Invar, an alloy which, when heated,
contracts instead of expanding, has re
cently been invented by Dr. Guillaune,
the physicist. It consists of nickel and
steel, therefore of two metals which
each for itself expands rather consid
erably in heat. Correct measurements
have, however, shown that Dr. Gull
laune has really produced alloys which,
when heated, expanded even less than
marble or wood, and which, when
slightly changed in their composition,
even contract when heated. Propor
tions of compositions of alloys have also
been found so that they neither expand
nor contract, but remain the same in all
degrees of heat. *
The arsinoitherium is named after
Queen Arsinoe, daughter of the First
Ptolemy, who had a palace in the
Fayum in davs when that region was
more nearly habitable than it is to
day. The time that has elapsed since
the arsinoitherium lived is, however,
as much greater than that since Ar
sinoe as a century is greater than a
couple of minutes. Excavations in the
Fayum are still being pushed, though
under great disadvantages, owing to
the fact that the best localities are
three full days' march from water,
and many more finds are anticipated.
â Chicago Record-Herald.
Still more interesting, from the
point of view of scientists, however, Is
the arsinoitherium. an animal that
was bigger than the biggest of our
modern rhinoceroses. Some six or
seven skulls of this animal have been
secured, the largest having a lower
jaw over two feet in length. Above
the nostrils the arsinoitherium had a
hugre pair of horns projecting: forward.
The striking thing about these honrs
is that they were not of horny, fib
rous material, but bony outgrowths,
covered in life with blood vessels and
skin, like the horns of a giraffe,
though probably protected at the tips
with horny matter. Behind the big
horns was a pair of smaller ones. The
nearest relative of the arsinoitherium
known to science is the dinosaurus,
specimens of which have been discov
ered in Wyoming in sands of the same
age as those of the Fayum. The
Egyptian beast had the Wyoming one
beaten in the size of its horns, though
some of the latter have three pairs of
horns.

The quality of Yankee brains has been fearlessly as
cribed to this appetizing, fish diet, and over the State
House in Boston the effigy of the codfish has been long
given to the east wind, ?.s the origin of all the art and lit
'erature of the Hub. Margaret Fuller and all the srods and
goddesses of New England letters have been pointed to
as proof of the gray matter fertilized by codfish. Of
late years there has been a decline. New England has
iost;her literary primacy. The creat ones have passed
away.* Boston has ceased to produce the masters of
American thought. Public attention has been diverted
from philosophy to fisticuffs, and the greatest Yankee of
the generation is John L. Sullivan, pugilist and publicist.
This discouraging decadence must have a cause, and it
is at last revealed in the sophistication of codfish. It is
proved now that instead of the pure cod from Georges
Banks the fishermen of Gloucester fill their smacks
with hake and pollock, cusk and other inferior eround
feeding fish, the plebeians of the finny tribe. Codfish are
worth on the smack $5 per hundred pounds, while these
base-born substitutes are worth only from So cents to

The London Daily Mail prints an in
terview with a prominent ' physician,
who says: "The drug habit, whether
in tl Â¦Â» form of morphia or laudanum, is
more and more asserting a sway which
we a^e powerless to check."
The remark was prompted by the
case of a girl who, when remanded at
Bradford on a charge of stealing, at
tributed her po: Â¦Â¦>. to her craving for
laudanum and cigarettes. -Every effort
had been made to break her of this
habit. Her father had known of It for
three or four years, while the girl
confessed to a seven years' slavery to
the drug.
. v^pium, of which morphia and lauda
num are forms, is rapidly," the doctor
added, "becoming the intoxicant of the
upper and middle classes, there is
one person more than another suscepti- /
ble to the drug habit it is the neurotic"^
individual, and the neurotic being is
one of the products of the age.
"Town life is one of the chief factors
in the forming of a race of neurotics,
and in the town the opium habit Is so
easily gratified. â". person who wants
laudanum can visit a large number of
chemists and get small quantities from
each without raising any suspicions."
"A prescription containing opium is
often the beginning of the habit," the
doctor added. It would be better, he
thinks, if the^medical profession did
not prescribe opium so much in chronic
case?, but reserved It for acute ail
ments.
"I note," he said in conclusion, "that
this girl was addicts to cigarettes.
This is strange, for the devotee of
opi"in is generally faithful to the drug.
But it is suggestive in . this regard
that I have recently heard that a cer
tain v -and of cisrirettes contain opium."

We have high hopes invested in the future of the
cast side of the bay. San Francisco has there a hinter
land in- which the metropolis can never lose interest.
The State has there some of its most important insti
tutions. The people have there good things to steal
and heads to be cracked. Berkeley, under the circum
stances, should emerge from the chrysalis of a village
and be,.the butterfly that nature intended. The people
should rouse themselves, enlarge the powers of their
municipal charter, build a jail and have policemen
enough to fill it with the moonlight mechanics who go
around cracking the well-stocked skulls of the university
professors.
WHAT is the matter with the town of Berkeley?
Is it a city suffering from a village organiza
tion? Is it like a man dressed in the clothes
of a child? If so, let the town slough its village gov
ernment and the man put by childish things. Berkeley
is too much in evidence in the operations of footpads,
burglars and highwaymen, who seek, the low ways
of life by resorting to any community that is insufli
ciently guarded, in order to prey upon its people. Now
we don't want this to be resented .by somebody in
Berkeley telling us that when the tiUtapper, porch thief,
thug and pickpocket no longer ravage San Francisco,
it will be trme to advise Berkeley.
San Francisco is big and can stand more thieves. But
Berkeley can't. It is a university town. It has unusual
charms and attractions. It is the home of hundreds
of families who* seek it for the excellent advantages
of the university and find life there in the midst of
every visible physical charm. The gardens of Gul bloom
in Berkeley, and from the green mountains above :t
to the sheen of the bay and the gilded path through
the Golden Gate in front and below, it is graced and
garnished with every charm of scenery and climate.
Yet .thieves are there and break through and .steal.
They also break heads with sandbags. When a univer
sity-professor cannot go from his house to the post
office without being knocked senseless by thugs, it is
time for Berkeley to wake up. We are told th*t the
town has only three policemen!
The university grounds, with their trees and shrub
bery, their copse and shadows, with the deep gorge of
the stream that flows by them, offer the best of night
hiding for marauders, and three policemen can 'no more
guard the town than the three tailors of Tooley street

Confession has followed quickly upon expose in the

uniform went hastily on his way amid
three cheers from the mob- Then the
mob returned to its work, to complete
it if possible before he whom they had
aided should come back at the head of
his own regiment, and perhaps order
them to be shot down.
There was but one thing to be done.
Ho made his way straight toward the
center of action, and called to a man
who was mounted on the pile, and was
evidently the leader of the tumult:
"I say, my good man, my regiment
has been called out by her Majesty's
orders. Will yoingive me a hand over
this pile?"
The man hesitated a minute, and
then said with decision, "Boys, the
gentleman 13 right. He is doing his
duty, and we have no quarrel with him.
Lend a hand and help him over.'
partment, telling him that his regiment
was ordered out to deal with the mob.
He hastened back to his own house,
but when he called for his horse he
found that his servant had received
permission to 1 go out for the evening,
and had the key of the stable in his
pocket. The officer hastily donned his
uniform and then had to proceed on
foot to the Guards' Armory, which lay
on the other side of Hyde Park. Walk^
ing hastily in that direction, he came
out unexpectedly at the very headquar
ters of the mob, while they were al
ready piling up the fences.
His uniform' was recognized, and an
gry shouts arose. It must have seemed
for tho moment to the mob that the
Lord had delivered their "worst enemy
into their hands.
The cat seemed to be utterly oblivi
ous to the fact that any substitution
had been made and offered no resist
ance when her foster children cuddled
up to her to be nursed. Schmitz says
that, if anything, the cat is even more
solicitous for the baby, foxes than for
the kittens, and both the cat and the
foxes are doing well.*
One of the Almshouse attaches mor
tally wounded a fox in the forest back
of the institution- a day or two ago and,
on trailing the wounded animal to her
lair, three young foxes apparently a
few davs old were discovered. The
young animali- were brought to Super
intendent Frank Schmitz, who at once
hit upon a scheme to raise them by
providing a foster mother in the per
son of the cat which has made the
Almshouse her home for many years.
The cat was at the time nursing her
own offspring, consisting of four kit
tens. The latter were drowned forth
with and the baby foxes were placed
under the protecting care of the mother
cat.
Another Substitution Case.
Confined In a cell in the Detention
Hospitals for the insane suspects at
the City Hall, deserted and disowned
by her children and other blood rela
tives, is a woman who at one time
was the wife of a German Baron. Early
residents of this city and old members
of the Police Department would, if the
Baroness' name was mentioned, recol
lect the sensation which was created
when a policeman wi <l i a German title
eloped with a widow, the mother of a
large grown up family and the pos
sessor of a large fortune left her by
her departed husband. The self-styled
German Baron, who was incidentally
a policeman, had obtained leave of ab
sence from the Chief during the time
he won the* widow and her fortune,
much to the indignation of her chil
dren. All persuasion on the part of
the family and the Baroness* sisters
could not induce her to quit the man
she so desperately fell in love with.
After enjoying a brief honeymoon at
the bride's expense the couple returned
to this city, where they resided for
some time, . until eventually the deluded
woman found herself deserted and her
fortune squandered. The Baron de
serted the .country and was lost to
sight.
â¢ Since that time this woman had
eked out a kind of an existence until
in her old age she was forced to throw
herself on the charity of the taxpay
ers and seek shelter and food in a pub
lic building. Now she is held for in
sanity. Such is the glamor of a title.

that they omit essentials and have included only a part
of the factors.
In New England and the Middle States, observation
confirms the 'fact that destruction of the forests has
made the earth's crust the drier and has impaired the
fertility of the soil. It is doubtful if observations made
in Germany can be applied to other countries, differently
situated in relation to the origin of the rainfall they re
ceive. It is a small country, subject to the influence of
the Baltic, and the North Sea. Its supply of moisture
from those bodies of wojer is close at hand, and their in
fluence may well produce an average humidity over for
est and plains.
But the test of the real function of the forest in con
serving moisture is not to be made in the air but in the
soil. . We are of the opinion that a cubic yard of soil
from the forest floor will be -found to contain more
moisture than a cubic yard taken from untilled land at a
distance from the forest, and at the same depth.
The German report will be taken as a challenge to the
American climatologists and foresters, and they will
find in California the proper field for experiments, which
will either, demonstrate or disprove the function of the
forest as a conserver of moisture in the ground, not in
the air.

Major Carrington's battalion of Phil
ippine scouts passed review and in
spection before General MacArthur,
commander of the Division of the Pa
cific, yesterday morning at 10 o'clock.
The battalion was drawn up in line
shortly before that hour, in front of
the general hospital buildings, awaiting
with anxiety and curiosity the arrival
of what they called the "big chief."
Precisely as the clock â¢ struck ten,
General MacArthur drew rein in front
of the troops, and, dismounting, fol
lowed by his aids. Major Parker W.
West and Captain Frank L. Winn,
walked on to the parade grounds, where
they were received by Major Carring
ton. The greetings were short and for
mal. General MacArthur with staff,
accompanied by. Major Carrington,
then began the inspection of the troops,
walking up and down the long line of
the battalion, while the band played
a smart two-step. At the conclusion of
the inspection the general with staff
then withdrew from the field and after
mounting their horses again came on
the grounds for the review. The scouts
seemed to be imbued with the spirit
of the occasion and showed up to
splendid advantage. They* marched
with great precision, showing the ef
fects of long and careful drilling. They
presented a very soldierly appearance
as they passed the reviewing stand at
port arms in column of companies.
SPECTATORS APPLAUD.
Following the review proper they
went through a number of exercises
from Butt's manual of arms, in which
they made a big hit with the specta
tors, who applauded and cheered them
with great vigor. Following the re
view on the parade grounds. General
MacArthur with staff rode up to the
scouts' camp, where he made a thor
ough inspection of their quarters, after
which, in the commanding officer's
tent, he shook hands with the different
officers of the battalion. General Mac-
Arthur expressed himself as highly
pleased with the work of the scouts
and complimented Major Carrington
for the efficiency of his command.
During the review Major West, mount
ed on his spirited sorrel mare, Princess
lley, unexpectedly was compelled to
show an example of the splendid horse
manship training he received at West
Point. The animal, which js a magni
ficent thoroughbred, showed signs of
high life the moment she stepped on
the parade ground and, standing on
her hind feet, ran several yards be
fore the major was able to bring her
down on all fours. She followed up
this feat with a lot of pirouettings and
prancings that gave great delight to
the crowd of children on the field.
Whether the animal's gyrations were
caused by her introduction to the Fili
pinos is a matter of question, but at
any rate, the moment they came any
where in her vicinity she resumed evo
lutions that caused the spectators to
fall back with great alacrity.
CONSTABULARY COMING.
The battalion of constabulary from
the Philippines, due here on the Sher
idan next Friday, will, from present
expectations, be provided with trans
portation and go at once to the St.
Louis Exposition. This will, in all
probability, preclude any opportunity
for the people of San Francisco to
hear the splendid constabulary band
of eighty-five pieces, which is the finest
in the islands.
General C. . A. Coolidge, who was
taken to the general hospital at the
Presidio last week suffering from "what
was thought to be a severe attack of
appendicitis, is somewhat better, but
it is still thought an operation will be
necessary.
Major John R. Williams, adjutant
general of- the Department of Cali
fornia, will proceed to Manila on June
1. Mrs. Williams will go East to re
main with the children until their
schools close and then with them will
join the major in the islands.

The divorce business has reached
such 'proportions that Superior Judge
Ogden bejieves that it will be neces
sary to establish a divorce department,
in the courts the same as in the pro
bate and criminal departments at the
present time. In speaking of the mat
ter to-day he said: "There is as much
divorce business as there is probate
going through the courts. We are all
trying cases, but. 1 believe it will be
necessary to establish a divorce depart
ment. This would systematize the
work and it will only be a short time
before it will have to be done."
In connection with this subject
Judge Ogden stated that he did not
believe the divorce question could be
properly dealt with until the Legisla
ture fixed a penalty to be visited on
the spouse that gives the ground for
divorce. 'Continuing he said: "As the
matter now stands there is a premium
on crime. If a dissatisfied husband or
wife wants a divorce he or she com
mits some act to give the other the
cause. There is no punishment for
this and a decree of separation is hung
up as a prize. This is a boon to many
and is frequently taken advantage of.
If the party guilty of the offense could
be punished divorces would decrease."

, Judge Fritz had just emulated Su
perior Judge Cook's dismissal of the
murder charge and was leaving the
courtroom when Taylor moved toward
Ke"nnedy and laid his hand upon his
wrist. Kennedy attempted to release
the officer's grip, and in the ensuing
struggle the prisoner got decidedly the
worst of it. "Don't /Choke me, and I'll
go," he finally gasped. That closed the
incident. v
Kennedy was once convicted in the
Superior Court, but the Supreme Court
ordered a new trial and Judge Cook
dismissed the charge on the ground of
insufficient evidence. It looks as if the
police are determined to fill every pos
sible loophole by which he might again

son a couple of yearsNago, and his at
torney apparently shared that belief,
else-he would have advised against his
client's resistance.
Judge Mogan ordered Mrs. Garaghy
into custody for battery and contempt
of court, and then little Mrs. Johnson
took from her satchel a gold watch and
chain, pulled from one of her fingers a
golden insignia of wifehood and laid
the treasures upon the Judge's desk.
"They belong to him," she said,
nodding toward her husband, "and I
don't want to have anything of his in
my possession, for I'm going to be di
vorced as soon as possible."
Death is likely to divorce her be
fore any mundane court can perform
that service, for Johnson is so far gone
in consumption that he can hardly
walk. If he outlives the year's im
prisonment that has been prescribed
for him there will be something for
medical science to investigate.
Mrs. Johnson indignantly denied the
impeachment as to Jack.' "I want no
man on earth," she sobbed. "I have
had enough of men to last me a life
time. When this case is over I'm (go
ing back Jo my parents in Oregon. I
don't know this woman's son, and I
don't want" to know him."
"Oh, you liar!" shouted Mrs. Gara
ghy, shaking her fist at the smaller
woman. "I'd cheerfully do ten months
for one more crack at her," s^ie audi
bly informed one of the bailiffs\
verely disaproved by that lady. "She
is in love with Mike," said Mrs. John
son, "and is angry at me because I
am prosecuting him. She wants to
marry him." \
"I care nothing for Mike Johnson,"
Mrs. Garaghy declared, "but I'm sore
at his wife, because she. wants to get
him kept in jail so that she can get a
divorce and marry my -18-year-old son
Jack. That's what I thumped her'
for." ' Â¦ Â¦ '
Michael Johnson was bound over In
$5000 to keep the peace toward the pub
lic at large and his young wife Hattie
in particular, for six months, and just
as the decision was handed down by
Judge Megan there was a commotion
on the back benches that distracted
attention from everybody and every
thing else. When the bailiffs had el
bowed their way to the storm center
they found Mrs. Delia Garaghy, mid
dle-aged and muscular, firmly holding
fragile Hattie Johnson with her left
hand and vigorously punching her
head with a clenched right. The
women were separated and placed be
fore the Judge, where they told con
flicting stories as to the cause of the
assault. ;
Mrs. Johnson stated that since her j
husband was arrested, she has been ,
living in a lodging-house kept by Mrs. j
Garaghy at 207 Turk street, and that
the prosecution of Johnson was se-
There was not sufficient evidence^to
convict Herschel Goodrich of
Oscar Hug's pocket and he was dis

Judge Mogan.
Hug is a German and lives on re

land. He was touring the saloons of
the tenderloin when he fell in with
Goodrich, who pursues the respect
able calling of enlarging photographs.
The two men drank together and both
Stafford is under ball to appear in

Nicholas Stafford informed Judge
Mogan that he had, no complaint
against Michael McVey, a water front
saloon-keeper, by whom he was shot
in the leg.
"He did perfectly right in shooting,"
said Nicholas, "because a gang of us
were wrecking his place."
I There was nothing else for the
Judge to do than dismiss the case
against McVey, and that was ' done. '

MOULLEN" SAVES THE , DAY.
With the relay race out of the -way
the field day was still undecided and
Oakland High School finished second,
never being able to regain the advan
tage lost at the - start. This* was its
first defeat in. the league relay in ten
years of competition." The time for the
mile was 3 minutes, 30 4-5 seconds. The
previous record of 3:23 was Â» held by
Oakland. .
He was off lika a shot at the start
ing Kignal,_and ran as if his life de
pended upon his efforts. He opened
up a gap. of fifteen yards almost In
stantly. . He increased this slightly be
.fore the end of the relay, turning over
a decided lead to Beck, who had pre
viously won the 220-yard rsice. Johns,
Jones, O'Connor antL. Dodson each in
his turn . performed wonders, leaving
the other contestants strung out like
the tall of a comet.
Two records of the Academic Ath
letic League were broken, one was
tied and' in a number of instances the
winners were just outside the best
previous performances. , ; v -- :}
Lick's victory in the relay race was
a spectacular one. Owing to the size
of the track the first runner it called
upon to go only 170 yards, the remain
ing five each making a complete
circuit of the oval. Cope, who earlier
in the afternoon won the classic
"hundred" in 10 1-5 seconds, tying
the^ former record, had the first relay
for Lick.
Ukiah High School, 18 4-5 points.
Lowell High School, 17 points.
Berkeley High School, 11 points.
TWO RECORDS BROKEN;
The sturdy athletes of the Califor
nia School of Mechanical Arts (Lick
School), who have come to the front
with a rush this year, placed the third
field day of the season to their credit
yesterday at Berkeley oval.
The representatives of this school
scored the most points in the field
days of the San Francisco Athletic
League and of the Bay County Ath
letic League. They topped this off by
winning, for the first time, the spring
field day of the Academic Athletic
League. The battle for points was
bravely fought throughout the after
noon by the brawny representatives of
Ukiah High School, Oakland High
School, Lowell High School and Lick
School. The victorious Lick athletes
made a whirlwind finish, taking the
last two events, the relay race with
Its rich reward of ten points and the
hammer throw, which gave them five
points additional.
The scores of the leading teams at
the -close of the day's sharp competi
tion were:
Lick School.. 29 4-5 points.
Oakland High School, 27 4-5 points.

HIGH SCHOOL BOYS WHO PERFORMED
BRILLIANTLY YESTERDAY IN ACA
DEMIC ATHLETIC LEAGUE FIELD DAY.
Neglect is the charge upon which
Hattle E. Underwood is seeking a di
vorco from John C. Underwood, to
whom she was married at New Or
leans in July, 189S. She says that for
the last year, because of dissipation,
he has not provided for her.
Mrs. Mary S. â¢ Lazzarevich, the de
fendant int a suit for divorce brought
by W. A.' Lazzarevich, in an answer
and cross-complaint to his suit, de
nies Â¦ that she has ever been guilti
er unwifely conduct with one ChrLrler.
Bartlett, or that she. ever, left her
husband - and '. took up her residence
with him. She says she has always
been a fond, faithful and loving wife
and that Lazzarevich has neglected
her. ,
' Desertion and neglect are charged in
the complaints for divorce filed by Eva
F. , Hathaway against George Hatha
way, Nettle Bell against James R. Bell
and Rebecca Ingram against William
Ingram.
Frank GJaezer, proprietor of a res
taurant at C57 Clay street, who is be
ing sued for maintenance by his wife,
Alvina, answered her suit yesterday
with a /general denial of her charges.
He says the trouble between 'him and
his wife has been caused by thf* pres
ence-at their home of. her brother.
Edward F. Parker, who was married
to Alice C. Parker at Hamilton. Ohio,
in 1891, is seeking a divorce on the
ground of desertion. He alleges that
without cause or reason she left him
more than a .year ago. Desertion Is
also charged in the complaint for di
vorce filed by John H. -Cullen against
Maud.Cullen. They were married In
1900. Cullen wants his wife to resume
her maiden" name, Collins.
Mrs. Blumenthal is the divorced wife
of a Dri Blumel She is several years
her husband's senior. â¢ "â¢Â¦Â¦'. ;;Â¦
Blumenthal senior said his son never
had an income of 5100 a month, and
that at the present time he would not
be able to live but by his father's
bounty. He said. that he once started
him in a "light" business, but that he
did | not have the brains to J carry it
on, with the result that after a few
months he had to retire and call upon
his father to pay the bills he had con
tracted. "He is a mental weakling,"
said the - witness, "and, furthermore,
he is the victim of the wiles of this
woman. She deceived him, with the
result that without obtaining my con
sent he ran away with her to Reno and
made her his wife. That was in
August of last year. He only lived
with her three weeks."
A Dr. Price was then called and
questioned as to the mental condition
of young Elumenthal. He said that in
his opinion the young man had a plen
tiful supply of gray matter, and that
he was not by any .means mentally
weak. He said the young fellow had a
cardiac lesion of the heart, and that
was all. The lesion, he-said, did hot
affect his brain.
It is seldom that a man rated as a
millionaire will brand his son as a
mental weakling in order to save pay
ing 525 a month for the support of that
son's wife. It occasionally happens,
however, that such a father is dis
covered. One such did appear yester
day in Judge Kerrigan's court in the
person of B. Blumenthal, the million
aire glove manufacturer, who was a
witness" in the suit for maintenance
brought by^Nellie Blumenthal against
Emil Blumenthal, his son. He gave
his testimony In^ order to prevent his
daughter-in-law from proving that
young Blumenthal was in the enjoy
ment of an income of 5100 a month and
thus maintaining her claim that he
could easily afford to pay her 525 a
month for her support. The case was
continued until Friday to enable the
litigants to produce further testi
mony.
I Word was received in this city yes
terday that E. H. Harriman, president
of the syndicate controlling the bis
system of railroads, will be in this
city within the next twenty days. In
a palatial train Harriman is coming
west, accompanied by a party of New
York financiers, most prominent among
whom will be James Stillman, presi
dent of the National City Bank of
New York, the concern through which
John D. Rockefeller and the Standard
Oil Company transact their financial
business; Percival Kuhn of Kuhn,
Loeb & Co., which has been financier
ing the railroad magnate, and a num
ber of others closely identified with
Harriman in his Wall street opera
tions. According to the information
gleaned at the railroad offices yester
day, President Harriman has arranged
for a thorough inspection of all the
Harriman syndicate holdings in the
West, and in view of his coming prep
arations will soon be made for getting
everything in shape for his careful
scrutiny.
Although the local officials are not
inclined to discuss the real purposes of
Harriman's visit, it is generally sus
pected that he is preparing to float
another big mortgage, which will wipe
out of existence many of the mort
gages covering the smaller roads,
which have proved most burdensome
to him in his big financial maneuvers
because of the heavy rate of interest
they are demanding. By the time the
president of the Southern Pacific Com
pany reaches here the new
general managers of the -different
roads will have acquainted themselves
with the local conditions of their new
territories and will accompany their
chief and his millionaire friends over
the systems for the purpose of explain
ing matters that they may become in
terested in during their trip.
The Placerville and Lake Tahoe
Railway Company was incorporated for
; ?2,000,000 yesterday. The directors are
John Lloyd, J. Dalzell Brown, James
H. Swift. D. H. McEwen, S. J. Ras
sette, James Sallee and W. J. Bartnett.
Each of the directors, - with the ex
ception of Rassette; has subscribed for
51000 worth of stock. Rassette is the
owner of 564,000 worth, making a total
of 570,000 subscribed. According to the
articles of incorporation the company
is organized to build a road about
sixty-five miles in length from the
town of Placerville, El Dorado County,
in a northerly and northeasterly di
rection to Pino Grande, in the same
county, thence in a general easterly
and northeasterly direction to a point
on Lake. Tahoe, at or near Tallac.
According to* the latest figures in
the hands of the local officials of the
Santa Fe road, the westbound traffic
over the lines of that company for
March shows an enormous increase
over the same period of last year. Dur
ing the thirty days of last month the
Santa Fe brought to California 6009
passengers, as against 3283 for March.
1003. These figures include first and
second class passengers, and are re
garded as a splendid argument against
the predictions made late last year
that westbound traffic this year, in
view of .the St. Louis exposition and
other attractions in the East and Mid
dle West, would be much less than the
previous year.
Manager James Agler, Master of
Transportation G. T. Richardson and
Superintendent of Motive Power H. J.
Small of ihe Southern Pacific Company
have departed for El Paso, where they
expect to meet Charles Markham, the
new general manager of the western
system of the company, and accom
pany him on an inspection tour over
his 'new territory.

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
"Frauenliebe und Leben." the singer
was heard yesterday at the
Schumann-Heink best. Just what
that best is can be divined only
by those that heard her in
this exquisite little story of girl
hood and womanhood. The charm of
the poem, the loveliness of the set
ting, were enhanced an hundredfold
by the beauty of the interpretation. It
went right from the singer's to the au
dience's heart, and gathered much
tribute of tears and laughter by the
way. On* forgotâ as one always for
gets with Schumann-Heink, except,
perhaps, in the vocal steeplechasing of
an Arditi "Bolero"â that there is such
a thins as technique. One gets the
story, told in all its simple tenderness,
ecstacy, sorrow, with an art so perfect
that it perfectly conceals itself. And
one remembers only afterward the su
preme art that has gone to the tell
ing. As additional grace the singer
gave the Wolf "Heimweh" as encore,
by general request.
Fittingly, this greatest of Wagnerian
contralti ended her programme with
one of the few contralto ariasâ in fact,
I do not recall anotherâ from the Bay
reuth master, the recitative and aria
from "Rienzi." It is heroic, and was
heroically rendered, but is not Wag-*
ner at hi3 best. Still, it is herein that
Schumann-Heink's noblest measure is
taken, in Wagnerian opera that she is
at her greatestâ if not at her most
lovable, as in her Schumann and Schu
bertâand it is herein that she will be
most ardently remembered in history.
The new songs of the programme
were the "Befreit" of Richard Strauss,
charming in the Schumann way, and a
Spengel song, "Augen meine Fenster
lein," that is immediately likable.
There was also Brahms' "Sapphische
Ode." that was repeated in response to
a demand warm as the day's ther
mometer, a Schubert group, the Schu
mann "Fruehlingsnacht" and "WIe ein
Gruessen."
The first group of songs will be by
Schubert, and is as follows: (a) "The
Youns Nun." (b) "Rastlose LJebe." (c)
"Death and the Maiden," (d) "Sere
nade"; by Robert Schumann: (a)
"Waldegresprach." (b) "Fruhling
enacht." (c) "Ich Grolle NIcht," *r*
"Die Widmung." The great Br
will be represented by (a) "Laeb .
(b) two songs with. viola obiirj.
"Gestillte-Sehnsucht," (2) "GeL>;
Wiegenlied," (c) "WIe bist du m.i...
Konigen," (d) "Melne Liebe ist Grun."
This will be followed by the Fifth
Psalm by Rebling and Raff's "Sei
Still," both with organ accompaniment
played by Arthur Fickensher, and the
final numbers will be two of the great
est Wagnerian numbers of the great
artist, "The Erda Scene," from the
Rbeingold, and "Waltrauten Scene,"
from Gotterdammerung.
In the Schumann song cycle.
There were a. thousand people turned
away from the Alhnmbra Theater yes
terday afternoon at the last of the
Schumann-Heinle recitals there. The
thousand, however, need not despair.
The singer, who has made the greatest
furor in local musical annals since
Nordica, will be heard once again, on
next Sunday afternoon at the Tivoli.
Wagner and Brahms will be among
those represented on the programme,
that will be entirely new.

LOS ANGELES, April 9. â The
champions defeated Seattle again to
day in an interesting- game. Score 4
to 2. The contest was not remark
able for. clean fielding nor for partic
ularly brilliant play by either team,
but there was plenty of batting, errors
and kicking against decisions. It was,
in fact, a bitterly fought contest from
start to finish. Newton and Hughes
were the opposing pitchers and the
former kept the hits well scattered,
while the champions bunched many
off Hughes' delivery.
Van Haltren and Smith were the
only members of the visiting team
able to hit Newton with success. To
man injured his shoulder in sliding for
second base and gave way to Ray
mond. The fielding of First Baseman
Chase was a feature. Umpire* Hus

"Who won the game yesterday?"
"Oakland." "Who should have won?"
"Portland." That's the way they were
handing; it out in the . secluded spots
where the tall ones with froth on the
top could be had; for a V. Every one
was disgusted, with the exception of
Pete Lohman and his Oaklanders. They
were glad. Score 5 to 4 in favor of
Oakland.
â¢ Portland showed up in magnificent
form while practicing between innings.
Then they quit. They did even worse
,when men were on bases. All this
time Thielman was pitching ball that
would have won him fame and for
tune in the National or some other
big league. He pitched ball till the bit
ter end, but it availed him naught, for
fate and his fielders were pitted against
him.
Schmidt was hit good and hard at
times. He should have" been beaten
when his work is compared with Thlel
raan's, but his backers were in the
game at all times and they never over
looked a chance to score a run. Every
time Thielman came up to take a wal
lop at the ball, he was greeted like a
conquering hero.
Steelman, the Portland catcher, was
good or bad enough to let two runs
glide In. In the third inning, after
Schmidt had doubled to center and
Beck had allowed Ganley's grounder to
travel unmolested between his pins,
Drennan whipped the "ball perfectly to
the plate. Steelman got it, but waited
for Schmidt to knock it out of his mitt3
and that gave Oakland a chance to
start things.
Portland got all its runs on clever
drives. The score was 2 to 1 in their*
favor when Oakland came up in the
fourth. Then the stars of the/ north
col|apsed. After a hit or so was made,
Oakland commenced to send runners
over the plate so fast that the pace
became dizzy. â¢ It ended after four
made the rounds. That broke it up
and put Portland out of the running.
They managed to annex two more
before the game was over and but for
a lucky catch by Devereaux in the
ninth. the_^score might possibly have
been a tie. Freeman Was on first and
Beck drove a liner so fast that no
one saw it but Devereaux. He ate it
up with one mitt. A moment later Mr.
Francis tore off a double cushion swipe
that brought Freeman home. The next
man was easy and so it ended. The
score:
Oaklandâ Portland â

BOSTON, April 9.â In the home of
Mrs. Lannon, at Rocks Ferry, to-day,
two of the greatest pugilistic cham
pions of their day met in a- (friendly
way. The heroes of the , roped arena
and bitter antagonists. of other days
who received each other in a most
cordial manner were John L. Sullivan,
the former champion of all glove cham
pions, and "Charley" -Mitchell, the best
boxer that ever represented Great Brit
ain in the prize ring.
Mitchell was visiting '; the pugilist,
Mrs. Lannon's home beinjj the present
residence of her brother, the once
mighty John L.. The occasion of Mitch
ell's visit was one of kindly interest in
a man whom he fought in America
and also in Chantilly, France, for pre
mier . pugilistic honors. The former
champion of the Old World, had been
informed that the health oif Sullivan
was in a precarious. condition and tha^
he, needed financial assistance. Wish-
Ing to show his old opponent that he
bore him ;no ill-will and to declare his
intention to go" any length; to -alleviate
any, posible suffering on Sulivan's part j
Mitchell placed himself ' a* the .service
of John L. ; j ; - ! ,
â¢ Sullivan, whose physical C. condition
has'undergohe a decided change for.the

THE ONCE MIGHTY JOHXL.
The promoters of amateur prize
fighting will not~increase their purses
as demanded by the members of the
boxers' union. The members of the
California Athletic Association met
last night and unanimously voted to
stand by the old agreement and to
fight the boxers to the end.
"Rough House" McDonald, leader
of the movement on the part of the
amateur boxers, has been suspended
by the officers of the association. The
manager of the Lincoln Club stated
the organization would hold its show
on Friday night and that all its box
ers have signed to fight for the purses
offered by the association. The box
ers who failed to appear for the last
show scheduled by the Bay City Club
will be called before the association
on Tuesday night and asked to show
cause why they refused to fight after
having signed articles.

When Walt VivellV horse ran such; a
poor race on March 30 he was ridden
closing a 11 to 5 choice finished sec
ond. Bonner rode the Mounce entry
and if he dealt out the best he had,
then he is a poor rider. Joe Johns had
the leg up on Wiggins, played by the
sophomores. Bonner, on the favorite,
sat meekly trailing Titus until Wig
gins took the lead, turning into the
stretch, then he crowded on all sail.
Wiggins won. My Surprise second, Ti
tus third. Modder also started.
McXEAR OUT OF FORM.
Harry Stover's colt, George P. Mc-
Xear, apparently hadn't recovered
from the frightful disfiguring gash he
received on one leg three or four days
ago in a race, and The Mist ruled fa
vorite for the two-year-old dash. She
won, too. See rested McNear the first
part of the race, then beat Sea Air a
neck for the place.
Chickadee, the only one to be played
down In the betting on the mile and
a furlong selling affair, also cleaned
up. Her odds fell from $ to 3^ and
Knapp was indulged with full sway,
from start to finish. Searcher, be
cause of the inanition displayed by
some of the so-called pilots, was en
abled to come from the backwoods
and take the place. Blessed Damozel
and Fretter ran pleasing races.
Possessing speed to burn. Mansard,
the 4 to 5 favorite, made a gallop of
the six and a half furlong run*, See
took him out in front and at the fin
ish the big sprinter led Ocyrohe over
the line four lengths in 1:20. Ink, at
30 to 1, beat Ishtar for the show.
Charley McCafferty's Golden Light
was distributed about as one of the
best things that ever came down the
pike, to win the last, a mile selling
run. Possibly it was too warm, for
Bonner and Golden Light finished
fourth. John Lewis, on Illilouon,
headed Meehanus on the far turn and
won easily from Forest King. Oro
Viva was third.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Twenty-one books cut in. Barney
Schreiber retired and the vacancy In
the layers' ranks was filled by George
Rose. The latter quit more than 525,
000 winner at Los Angeles. -
George Miller, who trained Silver
Dick for Walter S. Hobart. got Into
trouble . over the pony race. George
had some hot words with Jake Holt
man over one of the starter's assist
ants taking hold of Silver Dick at the
start. Later George's conduct In' the
stand was considered unbecoming by
the officials and he was suspended for
the balance of the season and denied
all privileges. *
Reed's effort on Blessed Damozel
was an awful crude piece of riding.
For a horse that must have worked
so well, for he was highly touted,
Golden Light ran a poor race.
After reviewing the last two races
of Gateway the Judges should order
Veterano taken off' the suspended list.
The handicap, or any of the other
features of the card at Oakland track
yesterday were not a marker to the
amusement furnished by the "special"
for polo ponies at a quarter of a mile.
The starters were Silver Dick. Becky
and aiiss Miller, each carrying 115
pounds anÂ«l with a professional rider
in the saddle. \
Without exaggeration Miss Miller is
thÂ»- tartest piece of equine hardware
passed over the counter in many a day.
Duke of Milpitas and all of those old
time bud actors pale into insignificance
when compared with her. Thirty-five
minutes were consumed at the post,
during which time Jake Holtman,
three assistants, the recall flag, the
ttand messenger and the Judges' bell
were called into requisition before a
start was accomplished. Miss Miller
once dumped Sherwood from her back,
and did everything else but bolt the
outer fence.
During the festivities attendant on
getting her away. Spencer, \vh3 rode
Silver Dick, was lined $100 for break
ing up a start, and Powell, the rider of
liecky. got $100 for a similar offense.
Finall> Silver Dick, which ruled a 3
to 5 favorite, slipped away ah^ad of
the others to a fair start and toh a.s
he pleased, in 2S>i seconds. Becky lost
the place to Miss Miller by less than a
length.
With the weather so warm that the
temperature of the betting ring was
like that of a bake shop oven, the big
Saturday gathering took everything
good-naturedly. Favorites ran well to
form, capturing four events.
HONITOX BEATS GATEWAY.
P. Ryan's crack mare, Honiton, was
pjven an opportunity in the mile and a
sixteenth handicap to show what she
could accomplish in going a distance.
She had 110 pounds alloted to her by
the handicapper and was so well
thoupht of that her price in the books
was 1 to 2. Bonner again acted as
f-kipper and went out in front at the
ptart. The daughter of Ormonde cov
ered the first mile in 1:40, and in a hard
drive appeared all in, to down Gate
way a neck in 1:464- Our Bessie was
strongly fancied by the stable connec
tions, but lost third place to G. W. Tra
hern. Divino was left at the post.
My Surprise was the refrigerated one
for the introductory sprint, and after

For the California nine Captain Ad

Sweezey put up -the best article of
ball. "Heiny" Heitmuller did not
prove the equal of Sales in the box; in
fact, his work to-day was not up to
the standard he set last Saturday.
While he allowed one less hit than did
Sales, the hits were bunched and the
blue and gold pitcher for the most
part showed poor control. He struck
out only three men and walked three
and hit four with pitched balls.
Both teams showed improvement in
fielding to-day as compared with the
exhibition given last Saturday, al
though there were some ragged spots
in to-day's contest.
California has now one game and
Stanford one. The decisive game of
the series will 'be played two. weeks

ably in San Francisco. The score

SUMMARY.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 9.
The cardinal nine won the second
game of the intercollegiate series in
an exciting contest this afternoon, du T
plicatlng Berkeley's score of 6 to 2,
made last Saturday. Pitcher Sales
and Rightflelder Knight starred Â¦ for
the Stanford team. To the former's
pitching and the latter's hitting the
cardinal victory is directly attribut
able. Although the blue and gold bat
ters secured nine hits, one more than
their opponents, Sales kept the safe
ties so well scattered and had such
perfect control when in tight places
that Berkeley could score only twice
during the entire nine innings.
Sales walked but one man and
struck out. five. Knight secured three
safe hits out of four times up, and of
these one was a three-bagger and an
other a two-bagger. He was the first
man to whom Heitmuller, the Califor
nia pitcher, threw a ball In to-day's
game and his three-bagger started the
procession that ended in the car
dinals getting their first run.
In the second inning, with one man
down, Heitmuller walked Swain and
hit Trowbridge with a pitched ball
when Knight .came to bat and scored
both men with a line drive to center
field. He got caught, however, try
ing to make third by poor base run
ning in not sliding for the bag. In
the ninth inning Knight scored an
other run by sending Swain home
with a timely hit. The final two runs
were also made in the ninth inning
and were the direct result of Hamil
ton's inexcusable muff of Captain
Ball's fly over second.'
Captain Ball of the Stanford nine
distinguished himself by taking in
some difficult fouls and playing his
usual steady, consistent game.

The steam schooners, which were

j>ay was the reason for their being
tied up In the first place. When the
i engineer difficulty was adjusted the
: masters and mates came forward with
! demands. There was another adjust
ment, but the schooners remained Idle,
for seamen afid firemen had troubles
to be smoothed over, and no sooner
were the forecastles and stokeholes
made happy than there came a. wall
for more money from the glory hole.
j Peace had hardly been made with the

from. Among other things the cooks

Sailors and officers coming off watch
are in the habit of taking hot coffee
before turning in. The cooks demanded
that the man that made the coffee re

drank it at the rate of 5 cents a cup.
Sailors, firemen and officers joined with
the owners In protest against this ex
action, and yesterday It was decided

OAKLAND, April 9. â Four stal
warts from the junior class proved
the best crew in the interclass row
ing regatta held by University of Cali
fornia students on the estuary this
afternoon, between Alice-street bridge
and Sessions Basin. The winners
rowed away from, the senior crew in
the second preliminary race and in
the final test with the barge and oars
the champion juniors led the sopho
mores from end to end of the course
and beat them five lengths at the
finish.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of
the University of California was
referee and was delighted with the
(showing made on the water by his
boys. A. T. Thorning officiated as
starter and A. D. Smith as Judge at
the finish. The judges of the course
were Dr. A. R. Ward, C. L. Cory, J.
B. Lanfield and T. M. Beach.
In the first preliminary race the
sophomores defeated the freshman
crew six lengths over a course esti
mated to be about three-auarters of a
mile. The time of the winners was
4:46.
The contest between the seniors and
Juniors was the best of the day. The
course was about a mile and a quar
ter. For three-quarters of the dis
tance the barses were bow and bow.
On the last stretch the cockswain of
Xhe seniors sent his craft inside the
wrong stake and when he got on the
course again the Juniors had crossed
the finishing line. The time was 7:15.
The deciding race was easy for the
juniors. They held the sophomores
safe all the way over a -mile and a
quarter course and came in seven
lengths ahead in 6:35.
Following are the crews as they

xx^ \V vvM e wno ' e . fÂ° rce OI vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. When you.
\ XV * , \V^Â» lose that by draining the system in any manner, my Belt will replace it and cure you.
Mr. Harry U- Jackson, Valleton. Cal., writes: "Although you are a stranger to me, my heart warms toward you as a great benefactor . and friend, and I am more than
grateful to you. Already I feel the vigor of new life in my body; no aches and no pains. I wish you every, success In your work."
Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. They are a beacon light to the man who has become discouraged from
useless doctoring. I get such letters every day. / ' *
My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates. them, and stirs up a great force of energy.
Louise Klnir, Commercial Hotel, San Francisco, says: "I take pleasure In dropping you a few lines to let you know how greatly Improved I am since I got your Belt. My
headaches have left me and I am gaining in welttht. I feel like a different woman, and am very eratetul to you for all the good your Belt has done me." -
I make tlie best electrical body appliance in the world, having devoted twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. My, cures after
everything else has failed are my best arguments. - . â¢ . j
Mr Roy Burk McKlttrlck. Cal., writes: "From the first night I wore the belt I felt' new life In every part of my body. The weakness was checked Immediately, and I am
now able to do heavy work without tiring. I am glad I thought of the belt, for In no other way could the money bring me so much pleasure."
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or joints, "come-and-go" pains in his shoulders, chest or side, Sciatica in
his hip, Lumbago, Rheumatism, or any ache or pain, and my Belt will pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive out every sign of pain.
No pain can exist where my Belt is worn. â¢
Mr. J. L. Balrd of Oriand, Cal., writes: "My 'back is entirely well, and I would not take $100 for my belt If I could -not get' an other. It Is the best thing on earth for a
lame back." '
And these "old" men; these men who have burned the candle at both endsâ or even if they haven't â these men who for one reason or another
feel that life has lost its spice, that they are getting old too fast, I can. make them feel the sparkle and fire of youth again.
I'll never forget when Mr. A. Crawford of Pokegama, Oregon, an old man of seventy, wrote to me and said: '-'When I wrote to you last I
told you to send me a Belt to make an old man young, and you did. I am seventy years old, and since I have worn the Belt I feel as strong as I
did at thirty-five, and can do as good a day's work as I could at that age." It was two years ago that Mr. Crawford wrote me that letter. Here is
one I just got from him:
"In reply to your letter I am glad to say that I am just as much In favor of your Belt as I ever was. for It has been a remarkable help to me. I am seventy-two years old. but
I do not look any more than fifty. . Am enjoying perfect health, and will continue to recommend the Belt, as I have been doing right along, as I realize that but for It I should have
been dead and burled by this time." ' V
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet in the country which has not.cures by Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt.
Men and women who had tried their home doctors and every known medicine have come to me and been cured.
Mr. T. Tarerchl, 121 Halght st, San Francisco. Cal., says: "So words can express my feeling of gratitude to you. When -I raceived your " marvelous Belt I was In a very
bad condition physically. I was nervous, weak, dieestlon was poor. I couldn't sleep but' two or three hours In the night, my mental power was weak, though I had been naturally
very stronsr. and all these symptoms were the result of a sexual weakness. . Now I am well, and I am glad to have this opportunity to recommend the Belt to those who suffer from
such troubles as mine, for they will be restored to perfect health by your Belt."
Now, what does this mean to you, dear reader? If you are not what you ought to be, can you ask any better proof. to make you try it? Is
there a remedy which is as simple, as easy to use, as sure to cure and as cheap as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must
try it. In justice to yourself, and to those who look to you for their fc future happiness, try it : now. Act this minute. Such a matter ought not be
delayed. ,. ' l.'.-'^;"~ ' ,\'j.-',,lT.. ..',/ .,*''"' v .."-",â¢Â¦"Â¦â¢:."Â¦>' Â¦Â¦Â¦..:-Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦"Â¦-Â¦ Â¦.'-Â¦"'-
It's as good for women as for men. Worn while* you sleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle glowing heat from it constantly, but
no sting, no burning, as in old-style belts. ...
Come and see me if you can. I have a private consulting -room in which I will explain my method of treatment, and, perhaps, give you
the names *of some of your friends whom I have cured. â¢
Send for my beautiful book full of things, a man likes to read if he wants to be a strong man, I send it sealed free If you are a weak woman

of his sisters. . "I don't believe he fell

drowned off Cape Horn, without dwell

"SAN FRANCISCO. April 1.â Dear
Sir: Kindly publish this piece in your

A TRAGEDY
OF THE SEA
While Californians were seeking
shady nooks to court the gentle Pa
cific breezes yesterday afternoon their
fellow countrymen whose misfortune
it is to dvtell on the eastern half of
the continent were shoveling paths in
the snow and carrying hods of coal.
Beyond the Mississippi there were
cold rains, snowstorms and blizzards.
In the Golden State the people were
enjoying one of those days whose
praises Lowell sung. Out here the
flowers bloom and the birds are sing
ing in the trees. Back there the fren
zied storm sylphs shriek their ulula
tions down the chimneys. The thought
of such differences should make us
rest more contentedly than ever on
our couches of rose petals.
Professor McAdie of the Weather
Bureau took down dusty old tomes
from the top shelves yesterday in the
hope of chronicling a record for a" hot
day in April. The statistics, however,
showed that April 14, 1888, and April
12, 18S7. were hotter. The temper
ature yesterday mounted to S3 de
grees. On the other days mentioned
the temperature rose to 88 degrees.
Nevertheless, it was pretty warm.
Our daughters donned their shirt
waists and our sons went down to the
hat stores and had panamas charged
to us. The mahogany rung with coins
and the soda fountains returned their
cost. The fat man's collar wilted and
the slim man v.-as too warm to laugh
about it.
It was all due, according to McAdie,
to the existence of a great area of high
pressure. The disagreeable weather
in the East was due to an area of low
pressure. It was not warm a few
hundred feet in the air. In the stra
tum of atmosphere that enveloped
California the radiations from land
and water were confined and it was
hot in consequence. Throughout the
State the temperature was about eight
degrees above the normal.
McAdie thought that a west wind
was on the way yesterday. When that
arrives the weather will be cooler.
The west wind may come to-morrow,
or perhaps not until Tuesday, but it
will certainly come in the end.
Meanwhile the storms will rage
back there beyond the Mississippi. ;
GRAND FORKS, N. D., April 9.â
The storm seems to be over. Snow fell
without interruption for thirty-six
hours. A warm day will turn all the
snow to water, as there is no frost
in it. Basements here are being va
cated; also the houses on lowlands.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., April 9.âCen
tral Wisconsin to-day experienced a se
vere blizzard, Interfering- with traffic
in some cases. At Osceola six inches of
snow has fallen and the roads are
drifted full. - ,
The section of country around Fargo,
N. D., is shut out from communication.
Before the single wire .working west
failed last night it was learned that
thirty inches of snow had fallen -at
Fargo, and. that not only the main
lines of the railroads but all the
branches were tied up tightly. From
MapletonJ Minn., to Staples, Minn., a
distance of about 110 miles, it was es
timated that from S0O to 400 telegraph
poles had been blown down" or under
mined by water. Snow, plows are out
in all directions.
Much of the Great Northern's track
age in Eastern Montana is under a
foot of water and there is danger of
washouts at many places. The Mis
souri and Milk rivers are both out of
their banks and steadily rising. For
many miles on either side of the traqks
from Willis to Westward there is deep
water. The Northern Pacific is badly
demoralized.
HELENA. Mont., April 9.â An April
blizzard, bringing with it from two to
two and a. half feet of snow and sleet,
has practically isolated Western Min
nesota and a large section of North
Dakota. The storm,' which raged with
great fury from Thursday evening un
til late yesterday afternoon, not only
completely blockaded the railroads
with huge drifts, but so prostrated the
telegraph service' that lit probably will
be two weeks before it is restored.
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, April 9.â With
ten millions of people directly and in
directly interested in agricultural pur
suits, the Co-operative Farm Ma
chinery and Implement Company of
North America has been . organized
with a capital stock of $5,000,000.
Backed by the National Grange, which
takes $1,500,000 of the stock, the possi
bilities of this tremendous enterprise
are almost limitless.
William N. Whiteley, former "Reap
er King," with S. H. Ellis and R. L.
Holman, National Grangers, are at the
head of the company. Work on the new
shops will be started by June 1, and
within a year several thousand men
will be employed.
Since the announcement of the for
mation of -the company letters have
been received by Whiteley from manu
facturing companies in ten States of
the Union." They want to become affil
iated with his Â¦Â¦' company, which is
backed by the grangers, in the fight
against the trusts. These letters have
come without solicitation and show
that tho manfacturers recognize' the
importance of having farmers directly
interested in such an enterprise, which
is for their mutual benefit.
Whiteiey says that the manufactur
ers feel that it is too expensive to con
tinue the fight for trade against each
other. By coming under one company,
like this, backed by the farmers, much
of the expense incurred in maintain
ing separate enterprises will be abol
ished and this will result in enabling
the farmers to purchase their imple
ments for less money and at the same
time get a higher grade of machinery.

Miss Jessie Burns was hostess at a
very prelty supper on Monday evening
The Misses de Young presided with
their usual charm over the ice cream
and soda booth, Miss Helen wearing
a fetching frock of white lawn, while
her pretty debutante sister was dain
tily gowned in pale blue.
Ducats must have come in plenty, if
the crush meant anything. Miss Phe
lan, charmingly gowned Jn black chif
fon, did a land-offlce business in her
refreshment booth. And who was
there who. during the hours of the
reception, didn't o'erdo the regulations
of union service in the amount of work
turned out? But the causeâ ah! there
lies the incentive! And happy to-day
are the maids and matrons who stood
their watches so faithfully.
There were Miss Butler, Miss Burnett
and Miss Sheridan, demure and cool in
white; Miss Gorman in the tones of a
pale pink rose; Miss Collier* in blue,
like the flowers she gave to menfolk.
So, too, was Miss Ethel Hager in
blueâ blue chiffon, and a close rival she
would make to Greenbaum should the
clever maiden compete with him as im
presario.
Miss W. Dean be the fact proclaimed.
Miss Dean further distinguished her
self by appearing in a pretty frock of
pink lawn. Â¦ *
Such a bewildering kaleidoscope of
colors those maidens wore.
"l.*nder the greenwood' tree
Who Jovos to lie with me. -
And tur.e his nierry note
t'nto the sweet bird's throat, -
Come hither, come hither, come hither."
So sang the merry maidens who parti
j cipated in the garden fete on the green
! sward of the Phelan home yesterday
. afternoon. That their notes swelled
j lcud on the soft spring air and lured
j from desk, and â dare I say.it? â the
1 trackâ for know ye, the Burlingame
j ponies ran at the same hourâ was am
ply evidenced by the fine sprinkling of
j menfolk. the good, dear. men
j folk, without whom womankind is
lost and yet won't tell them so. and
! whose ducats are 50 necessary to make
j s show "go" â even a garden party â
that Is, when it's for a charity, when
it's the dollars rather than the gowns
and accessories that count.
Somewhere in empyrean spheres, the
day was fashionedâ part sun. part- haze,
all beauty, a symphony in pink and.
grayâ and it fell upon the grass that
rivals close the soft swards of Erin.
A white tent rose from the emerald
floor, wherein clever monologrues were
given by Miss Eleanor Haber; songs,
and sweet ones, by Mr. Borghese, Mrs.
"Wand and Signor Russo, while the
dear children, Miss Gracier and her
; brother, gave some fascinating dances.
And the tea! Now, here was a dis

Miss Rose Hennessy, well
known as a poetess and elocu-
tionist, of Lexington, Ky., tells
how she was cured of uterine
inflammation and ovaritis by the
use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound.
" De ab Mrs. Piskham : âFor years I
enjoyed the best of health and thought
that Iwould always do so. I attended
parties and receptions thinly, clad, and
would be suddenly chilled, but did
net think of - the Â¦ results. ; I caught I a
bad cold eighteen months ago' .while
menstruating, and this caused inflam-
mation: of the; womb and congested
ovaries. I suffered excruciating pains
and kept getting worsen My attention .
was called to your Vegre table Com-
pound and the wonderful cures it had
performed, and I made /up my mind to
try it -for two months and see what it;

Commissioner of Public Works
Woodward and City Attorney Long
held a conference yesterday rel
ative to the correspondence that
has passed between the board
of directors of the Modesto and
Turlock irrigation boards and the lo
cal Board of Supervisors regarding
the application of San Francisco for
water rights on the Toulumne River,
which iH now before Congress.
After a lengthy discussion it was
decided to send communications to
the irrigation boards asking them to
appoint committees and to set a date
for a meeting with the local commit
tee to arrive at some definite conclu
sion in the matter. As it stands now
Commissioner Woodward Is of the
opinion that the two irrigation boards
demand altogether too much for the
waiver of their water rights and a
compromise may be necessary before
taking active proceedings.

Regulations Regarding Ven
tilation and Sanitation Are
to Be Made Very Severe
The charter provides that an em
ploye of the municipal government
must be a resident of this city. While
there is a grave doubt as to whether
the charter governs the administration
of the school department, the Directors
believe that it is a good provision to
follow, and on that account, if for no
other, it will be adopted.
The rule on ventilation will be made
extremely rigid by the board and penal
ties will be imposed for its violation.
The Directors are of the opinion that
ventilation is one of the most impor
tant factors in the proper education of
the pupils. The rule will require that
the temperature of a classroom shall
be kept at a designated degree with
out variation. To that end there will
be suspended from the ceiling in the
center of each classroom a thermom
eter, so that the teacher may observe
the exact state of the temperature.
Rules affecting the sanitary condi
tions of the school buildings will also
be adopted 1 and principals will be held
responsible in such matters. .
The rules the Board of Education
has been revising for the last two
months are now in the hands of the
printer and will be formally adopted at
the next meeting of the board.
Some inconvenience has been expe
rienced in the past, owing to teachers
being unable to reach their schools on
time when it is foggy or stormy on
the bay. â¢ While such experiences have
been very few, still the board reasons
that if all the teachers would conclude
to live across the bay there would be
some days in the year when the open
ing of school would be delayed for one
hour and sometimes more. While this
argument has not altogether been the
cause of the favoring of the proposed
new rule, It is regarded as one in its
favor.
The Board of Supervisors in its pend
ing: revision of the rules governing the
conduct of the public school depart
ment is preparing tu incorporate a rule
requiring principals, teachers, janitors
and, in fact, all employes under its
jurisdiction to reside In Chis city.
The proposed rule will affect some
fifty teachers in the local department
who, live in Alameda, pakland, San
Mateo, Berkeley, Fruitvale, Sausalito
and Palo Alto. The rule to be adopted
contemplates fnaking it prohibitory for
school employes to live anywhere, else
but in San Francisco. Under the rule
such employes who live in suburban
towns must move to this city.
The board is of the opinion that the
interests of the department will be bet
ter subserved by requiring teachers tu
live here. The fact that they are earn
ing their money here seems to be an
argument in favor of the new regula
tion, regarded from the home rule point
of view.

"I feel sure," said Mrs. Gundry to
day, "that when Professor Moses gets
our explanation he will set the mat
ter right. The blossoms we used to
decorate our house were taken only
after permission had been secured
from the agents of the property. I
myself secured this permission. Be
sides, we did not take all of the blos-
The set speech of Professor Ber
nard Moses before his class in history
yesterday on the subject of co-eds, co
education, etiquette and peach blos
soms has stirred up an awful fuss in
Berkeley. The *Pi Beta Phi sorority
girls, to whom Professor . Moses re
ferred as the vandals that had deco
rated their houpe with his own peach
blossoms and then read the Scripture
lesson on purloinery, want their tra
ducer to apologize, and if they do not
get an apology they are going to Presi
dent Wheeler. In the meantime Pro
fessor Moses will not apologize, and
there you are.
The Pi Beta Phi girls set about to
secure a correction of the impression
that Professor Moses has made on the
minds of perhaps a million people as
soon as they saw the account of what
he said this morning. Mrs. Virginia
Gundry, the chaperone, wrote a note
to Professor Moses explaining the
whole transaction. Then she tried to
see President Wheeler, but he was out
of town and will not be seen until
next week. It may not be necessary,
however, to see President Wheeler as
Professor Moses may be prevailed
upon to change his views in regard
to co-eds.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, April 9,
Assistant Division Superinendent
Baker confirmed the story of this latest
move of the railroad company to-night.
He said that it had long been contem
plated by the traffic department of his
company and the final step did not sur
prise him.
The new order of things means a
hardship for school children, who have
been in the habit of using trains to
carry them to school. It Is just pos
sible that there may be a contest in
the courts over the change, for, ac
cording to the company's franchise,
riding within the city limits Is to be
free. The Southern Pacific people,'how
ever, seem to be willing to face the liti
gation.
It does not demand any great study
to discover why the railroad has un
dertaken to charge fares. The Key
Routs has been cutting into its receipts
ever since it was started and it is
doubtful if It pays to run Its fast
trains. The most galling thingr, per
haps, is the knowledge that Its â¢ trains
have been carrying people free from
air parts of town and feeding them to
the company's rival.
This step has long beep contemplated
by the railroad people, and a few days
ago the traffic management decided to
inaugurate a train-gate The
gates have been on the cars for a long
lime, and all that is necessary Is to
supply them with gatemen. Two sta
tions, Uerryman and Dwight way,
have been established, and tickets will
be sold from them by agents. After
this any intending passenger on the
Southern Pacific trains must purchase
A ticket before setting on the train.
At Ashby station no ticket office
will be placed just yet. No reason is
given for thiE omission, but It is prob
ably nn account of the small amount
of traliic there. Passengers may get
on at Ashby and the "conductor will
collect their fares. Fares have been
charged for some time between Dwight
way and Lorin station, so these places
will not be affected by the change, ex
cept that passengers must get tickets
before getting on trains, not afterward,
as now.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, April 9.
Free riding between stations on the
Southern Pacific Company's local trains
came to an end with this day. Gatemen
will go on duty on the trains to-mor
row morr.hig. and the system of free
rides that has existed ever since the
service began in Berkeley twenty years
ago will be forever abolished.
The agents of the property â
Cheney. & Berry, say they gave the
co-eds permission to take some blos
soms from -Professor Moses* place.
They also add that they do not think
it was the Pi Beta Phis that committed
the vandalism complained of by Pro
fessor Moses, but some others in the
neighborhood. -; V '
"I apologize! I never apologize
when I know I am right. As for the
taking of the blossoms, that is really
a small matter. The other things I
spoke of â co-education, sorority life,
society â are of most importance, and
I meant every word I said."
soms, for others in the neighborhood
used them for decoration, too.
"I intended to see President
Wheeler about it to-day, but he is out
of town for the present. I also wrote
a note to Professor Moses and perhaps
when he receives it he may change his
views in regard to us."
As for Professor Moses there seem3
to be little hope of an apology and
unless the statements of the Pi Beta
Phi girls are most convincing he is
more than likely to stand his ground.
When asked to-day if he would apolo
gize he said:
At the Haijrht, Mastiek, Longfellow,
Wilson and Everett schools, the prin
cipals will preside and explain to their
pupils the meaning and importance of
the occasion. Financial aid has been
given the arbor day movement by the
Alameda Advancement Association, the
West End Improvement Club and the
Civic Section, of the Adelphian Club.
ALAMEDA, April 9.â This city will
hold it3 second annual arbor day on

extended to the ladies of the Adelphian
Club, who were chiefly instrumental in
inaugurating arbor day here, to take
part in the exercises and it Is expected
that several of them will rielivor bjlef

OAKLAND. April 9. â The accusa
tion against Constable Olympia of San
I^oandro, looking to have him ousted
from office, was dismissed by Judge
Hail to-day. Olympia. was charged
with having exceeded his authority in
releasing Guy 15. Covey because of a
defective warrant.
The Judge decided that the whole
question turned upon whether the
warrant was defective. If the war
rant was void Olympia could not be
punished for not holding the man. If
the warrant was legally sound then he
was guilty of malfeasance in office.
The document was punched full of
technical holes by Olympia'a attor
neys and the case was dismissed.

man said this afternoon that some $600
would be cleared for this purpose.
"Spirit of Summer Time," "The Golden
Rod," "Snow, So Fair"; primary songs.
Longfellow school; "Sailor Song."
To Mrs. Sweesy. superintendent of
instruction in singing in the public
schools, is largely due the success of
the concert. She had entire charge of
the training of the 500 children and de
voted weeks to the work. She was
assisted by Schools Superintendent S.
D. Waterman and a number of the
teachers in the public schools. Under
their direction the following pro
gramme was carried out:
"Columbia, Glorious Nation," cho
rus; "Sengs of the Season." chorus;
"An Apple Orchard in the Spring."'
The children were all perfectly
trained. They might have been pro
fessionals, for all anybody knew. The
voices were all in soprano, as all chil
dren's voices are, but this was the
charming part of it. The color of the
pretty picture was heightened by the
appearance of the primary children of
the Longfellow school in sailor hats of
white and blue.
BERKELEY. Ai>ril 9.â The voices of
oOO children were blended in song this
afternoon in the Greek open air the
ater at the University of California.
Five hundred is a large number, but it
seemed as if those little tots were only
a good-sized mouthful to the monster
in concrete. The immense stage looked
ab if it had been sprinkled with a
crowd of pretty children in gay cos
tumes of r>ink and white and blue.
The children occupied tiers of seats
rising from the edge of the stage, so
distributed that the boys' and the
girls' voices were blended harmoni
ously. In the center there was a space
for the director. Mrs. L. V. Sweesy,
and often this was occupied by tots in
costumes, who presented pretty exer
cises.
"Whereas. Two inmates of the Ala
meda County King's Daughters' Home
for Incurables, viz: Mr. A. L. Larkin
and Miss Matilda Rudberg, have ap
plied to the Board of Directors of the
above named institution for permission
to be married to each other and the
Board of Directors have deemed it ad
visable to refuse to grant such a re
quest. Therefore be it
"Resolved. That in the event
of such a marriage, we de
mand the withdrawal of the said per
sons from the institution; and all
money heretofore paid for their main
tenance and care, while inmates of the
home, be upon request, returned to
those who have paid the same to this
institution."
Thus love has been banished from
the home.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, April 9.
By an edict of the Board of Directors
of the King's Daughters Home, billing
and cooing must come to an end in
that institution and the hospitality of
the place barred to Cupid. The little
god is no longer free to discharge his
darts among the old people of the
home. It is strictly a home for in
curables, and love's treatment is not
in accordance with the most advanced
ideas existing at that institution..
The matter is the subject of serious
resolutions and whereasing . in which
the board forever quenches the love
fires that may burn in the breasts of
the hopelessly afflicted.
The question was brought up by the
request of A. L. Larkin, oven 61, and
Miss Matilda Rudberg. 60, to join
hearts and hands in wedlock. To this
request the board has made the fol
lowing reply:
'â¢Resolved, That it is the -sense of
this Board of Directors that marriages
between inmates of the Alamed|i
County King's Daughters' Home for
Incurables shall not be permitted, and
be it further
"Resolved, That should any persons
while inmates of this home be mar
ried, such persons shall forthwith be
dismissed from the home.

Proprietor, Clerk and Cus
tomer Lined Up Against
the Wall by Highwaymen
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway. April 9.
A hold-up occurred to-night in Fruit
vale In which two masked men. rach
carrying two revolvers, and three vic
tims figured. The profits of the hold-up
were not larce. but the highwaymen
o?oapod. The robbery occurred at th*
store of G. A. Grimes on the Kedwood
icad and School street in Fruitvale,
j.hortly before S o'clock. Mr. Orimes. a
clerk and one * customer were in the
ttore. when thÂ«* d<x>r was suddenly
thrown open and two men appeared.
Each was masked with a handkerchief
and, according 10 the stories of the
btartled victims, there was a revolver
in each hard of oath man.
The three inmates of the place were
lined up against the wall, and one of
the rubbers searched them while th<*
others kept them covered with a brace
of revolvers. The men went through
the money drawer, and finally disap
peared with the statement that the
first man who ventured out of the
store iwuM be shot as he emerged.
This kept the victims inside for some
time .ind Rave the highwaymen a good
atart.
Fruitvale has no police force, and
the robbery occurred about <hree
blocks outside the city line of Oak
land. The Oakland police department
was communicated with, but it could
not send men outside of the city limits,
and the robbers escaped.

only a portion of which were unleaded In time
to be marketed. Receipts of old Potatoes frcm
nearby sources were light and there was con
tinued firmness in all descriptions. A small

brought $i 45. Early Rose had a further nd
vance. A little â¢ easier feeling prevailed In
Onions. Jobbers were still asking the top
quotation for Australian. . while importers were
offering freely at the Inside rate.
Trade In miscellaneous vegetables was active.
as retailers were buying for two day's require

The Chicago letter of Mitchell. Mulcahy & Co.
said yesterday: "The pit has been in an up

ed by heavy selling for local account, which
uncovered stop orders, and It looked as if pack

brokers. Eastern demand for Hoes shows no
Improvement. Stocks p.re accumulating and
the speculative situation is still unhealthy be
cause of the larse scattered outside holdings.

CHICAGO. April 9. â Higher prices at Liver
pool imparted firmness to wheat here at the
opening. Freezing weather in Kansas also
brought out some buying orders. Initial quo
tations en July were a shade to %@%c higher
at t>7Tit'^%c. Sentiment in the pit, how
ever, soon turned bearish, the prevaillns'opin
ion belns that the rain and snow which wer-j \
delaying farm operations In the Northwest j
were of sufficient benefit to winter wheat to
more than offset any probable decrease in i
acreage of spring wheat. At the same time
th* Weather Bureau forecasted warmer
weather for Kansas and Nebraska. This
caused additional selling and In the absence of
nny material support the market became weak.
The volume of business was comparatively
light, the maiket luine inclined to develoo
Into a waiting affair pending the issuance of
the Government crop report due Monday. In
timations that the figures would show a more
favorable condition of the crop than generally
anticipated increased the bearish tendency.
Prices steadily declined throughout the day,
the close being practically at the low point.
After touching 8Â«%c, July closed at M;%^
8(>^c. May ranged between 94',ic and y5Â»,sc
and cIomhI at Â»4%c.
Influenced by steady cables, by firmness in
wheat and by unfavorable weather, the corn
market was firm a short time early in the
day. The weather forecast, however, was for
clear weather. The close was weak, July %c
lcwer at M%e51%c.
Oats ruled weak. July closed at 37?ic a
loss of %c.
The trend in provisions resembled the act-ori
of thÂ« grain markets. Opening prices were
a trifle higher on a fair demand, but offerings
were more liberal than the demand. The closa
was weak, with July 30c lower, lard was of!
2Or and r!bs 22%Â«J23c lower. '

The warm weather did not have the stimu

expected and trade was of smaller volume than
usual on Saturday. The large sizes of Navels
were In ample supply and were offered at easy
rates, but moved- slowly. DeaU-rs reported a
steady Inquiry for-, the small sizes of choice
and standard - Navels, .and as stocks of such
fruit were closely cleaned up desirable lots
commanded a premium. Â¦ The managers of the
auction company announced that at least
twelve and probably fifteen cars of Oranges
would be auctioned on Monday. " The other
Citrus fruits stood as previously quoted, tho
demand being fair and supplies ample. Ba

WHEATâ Hamburg cables reported the Rus
sian crop damaged by frost. Chicago opened
higher but closed lower. Foreign futures
were ' firmer. The Chicago advices of !
Mitchell, Mulcahy & Co. said: "Tly ,
market closed about l'*c lower. It;
was very nervous and a good proportion of
the trade was local. After a fairly strong
start prices weakened and closed about Â«U
the low price for the day. There was a gen
eral desire to even up over Sunday In anticipa
tion of the Government report to be issued
Monday afternoon. Those who- were conspic
uous on the buying side yesterday .and early
this mornirK were best sellers as the market
declined. Western weather remained unset
tled but advices as regards seeding In the
Northwest are somewhat conflicting. Broom
hall predicts liberal increase in world's ship
ments for the week. World's visible, supply
of breadstuffs April 1st shows a liberal in
crease as compared with corresponding dates
of a year ago. The speculative position, we
think Is quite a little stronger as the result
of to-day's liquidation and we believe wheat
should be boupht on any further break for
moderate turns." *
This market is weak and quiet. The mil
lers are not bidding for Wheat, as the Â¦ Flour
demand has fallen off and some mills will
take advantage of this to close down and clean
up. Cash quotations, however, remain un
changed. '

COFFEE â C. E. Blckford's circular glvei
the receipts at this port thus far this year
at 07,339 bag's, against 101.678 during the
same time in 11)03. The sales from first hands
were 4S.091 bags, against 54.5CÂ«. The stock
in first hands April 1 was 3S.2S6 bags., against
72,229. The world's visible supply^ April 1
Â¦was 12.918,110 bag*, against 12.3S0.C27 last
year. The circular says:
"Our last circular was dated March 5. Since
that time there Is a steadier tone in all mar
kets and locally a fair resumption of demand
â mostly confined to coffee purchasable at lera
than Oc. Very low grade*, say qualities worth
less than 7c, arc extremely scarce and pre
miums for these are being paid In consequence
above their Â¦ relative value.
"Arrivals from Central America are pro
gressing slowly, but as the crops were gener
ally-said to have been retarded thirty to sixty
days, it is reasonable to expect heavier re
ceipts later on. although ' there !s no doubt
now but that the season's total will fall far
short of last year's." All authorities seem to
agree that Costa Rica will give perhaps half
a crop, and the latest news from Guatemala
Indicates a material falling off there. Salva
dor, it Is believed, will furnish a full crop,
but not as much as at first estimated.
"Unwashed Salvadors, which declined to Sc
toward the middle of March, were freely taken
at that figure and better, closing to-day firm
and scarce at S%c to 8%c. Washed coffees,
on the contrary, have not sold so well except
for extreme top qualities, for which latter full
quotations are still demanded and occasionally
paid. Intermediate classes have generally sold
lower. There is a steadier feeling noticeable
during the past few days and our rjÂ£t_ closing
quotations are not materially altered compared
with those of March 5.
"Brazil coffees In New York are V*c to %c
higher and futures 35 to 40 points better In all
positions, compared with the figures of March
5. The world's visible supply on April 1
showed a decrease of 2C3.000 bags. It had
been previously estimated at 400.000 to 500.000
bags. There has been no news concerning this
or the next crop which In any practical way
wouliV change the figures heretofore given from
different sources. , n . oo

- If the sons of Italy, with their tiny
possesisons, could build , the famous
road that winds its length along the
Adriatic is it too much to" hope from
us of .new Italy, with unbounded
wealth and resource, to simply restore
what the old King, of Spain built for
us a century agone? The proposition
is sane; it is poetic; it: is_ of historic
Interest, therefore" of value ,. to the
tourist, and it. is of material or com
mercial value in consequence. It is
of . importance - to the farmer, to the
for it 'is the understood plan to have
the survey made by a body/ whose
business it will be to serve. the State
in this matter. Then it is proposed
to have each county dp its own actual
work.
Shorn of verbiage, the general plan
is to form a permanent organization
whose business it will be to carry to
the end the establishment of this great
highway from north, to south of the
State. That its business will be to go
before the Legislature of next spring
and ask (now, don't get exicted) not
for an appropriation vast enough to
pwing the enterprise, but for Just
enough to eurvey the old mission
roads. Now It is noised abroad in the
land that Governor Pardee will stand
pat on such a modest bid for funds,
â¢ "Sixthâ To make this main highway
frqm San Diego to Sonoma Mission a
memorial highway, preservingits Span
ish namÂ« of III Camino Real and urg-
Jng the building of an extension there
of from its northern terminus northerly
through the Sacramento Valley to the
northern limits of' the State as a main
highway.
"Fourthâ Investigating the adapta
bility of portions of this rbad to the
purposes of a main highway, with the
twenty-cne Franciscan missions as sta
tions nnd landmarks upon it.
. "Fifth â Securing surveys in each of
the counties along this route of as
much of this ancient road as is in ex
istence.
"Thirdâ Preserving the original gov
ernment road of Spanish California be
tween the missions San Diego and So
lano de Sonoma.
"To Santa Barbara on the 19th!**
That is the slogan of the south, the
ambition of the middle counties and
the decision of the people "up north."
:sjy. but things are setting busy
"up north:**
What's doin* at the old mission
town on the 19th? Why. on that date
delegates from every hurg in Cali
fornia vriU gather there by the side
of the sea to formulate rlans for the
restoration and perpetuity Â°* lhe O ld
2Â£injr"s ULgh\va>- â the road bullded
from the Mission San Diegro de Alcals
<San Die^o) to San Francisco Solano
(Sonoma) on the north.
Rightly speaking, the Camlno Real
of original planning terminated at the
Mission San Francisco de Assisi (Do
lores)âour own fascinating but sadly
unappreciated mission out on Dolores
street. And by the way, how manj'
of ms, who would resent vehemently the
charge of fc. dearth of patriotism, have
over set foot in that wonderful old
sanctuary â the one structure in all our
northern territory coincident with the
birth of our cation?
But why call up delinquencies? It's
never too late to mend our ways. And
therefore the convention at Santa
Barbara on the 19th and 20th. There,
within sound of the mission bells,
whose peal has echoed from hill to
hill Ahese hundred years â a very re
spectable age as we Americans re
gard time â will be gathered together
the most remarkable aggregation of
people California ever garnered in her
name. "In her name" is the watch
word of the convention.
The delegates go frofn North, South,
East and West of our vast dominion â
vast in truth as measured by our dear
ancestors, the New England Statesâ
with no man's dollars in their Jeansâ
or auto bags â but their own, to save
what should have been saved a quar
ter century ago. 'Twas about that time
that men's equilibrium became stable,
after the pandemonium of making â
or losing â fortunes over night.
Herewith I beg to. present to the pub
lic once more the objects of the con
vention, whose one distinctive feature
â and let it be cried from our hilltops â
is not self-interest, but State interest
It is California â our State! And per
mit me to ask, preparatory to present
ing the object, where in the world, the
vast, vast world, is there such a possi
bility for a highway as our lovely State
presents? And the beautyâ likewise the
feasibility â of the plan is the fact that
a vast part of the old original road
exists to-day as county roads.
And where a deviation exists from
the original trail, as does between
Kings City and the beautiful mission
of San Antonio de Padua (Monterey
County^, it is proposed to keep to that
road â even though it be ten or twenty
or a hundred feet from the original
carreta road. What or where would be
the practicability of abandoning a good
existing stretch of road for an unsur
veyed and impractical donkey path
way, merely because of an historical
record that a dozen donkeys came
north that way in 1770. If success is to
attend the efforts of the Santa Barbara
convention, it is only by keeping with
in the boundaries of practicability â and
we will, good friends and fellow citi
zeVis, we will; at least, we'll try.
Herewith is the plan of action, some
what tardily presented:
'Firstâ To unite all the commercial,
social and agricultural interests of Cal
ifornia in a general plan for improve
ment of the public highways.
"Second â Such plan to include the
procuring of legislation by the law
making body of the State of California
that will provide for the participation
by the State government in the pre
liminary location, surveying and plat
ting of a comprehensive system of
roads for the State and the appropria
tion of a fair proportion of the funds
necessary for the construction of the
same, and to secure for such purpose a
fair proportion of sueh moneys as may
appropriated by the national Gov
ernment for public road building, and
by it apportioned to the State of Cali
fornia.
