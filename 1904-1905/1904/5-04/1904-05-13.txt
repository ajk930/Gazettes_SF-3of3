A statement issued to-day by Sen
ator Caldcron.', the Peruvian Minister,
says, in part: "Brazil's attitude Is un
justifiable, also in '*" its pretension
that Peru, previous to the initiation
of negotiations, should , evacuate the
disputed zone. That would mean the
voluntary abandonment in favor of
Brazil of the land, the" occupancy of
which has been admitted as legitimate
by his Excellency Magalheer, a prede
cessor of Baron de Rib Branca (Bra
zil's Minister for Foreign Relations)
with regard to the headwaters of the
Yurua' River.
"The â¢ conciliatory policy of the
Peruvian Government with regard to
the dispute may be easily ascertained
by its two recent proposals to Brazil's
Foreign Office, which were, unfor
tunately, rejected by the latter. One
was- the determining of points and pro
visional : possession in the disputed
river, and . the other unconditional ar
bitration.. In view, of the rejection of
the proposals just mentioned, it has
finally 'submitted plans! of neutralizing
the , disputed zone, pending: an under
standing or award of , ah arbitration
tribunal that should decide upon 'its
Ultimate destiny, and- it is hoped-that
this . conciliatory effdrt ; on the part of
Peru shall â¢ meet- with .> the approval of
the Government at Rio de Janeiro."
WASHINGTON, May 12.â Instead of
tending tc.tvard an amicable settlement
by arbitration of the dispute between
Brazil and' Feru over the sovereignty
of the Acre territory, the question is
growing more bitter and is likely to
result, in a prolonged war. Peru now
doubts the expressed intention of Bra
zil in the Acre territory and bitterly
resents the Brazilian demand that
Peruvian ' troops within the disputed
zone immediately vacate. The nearest
Peru has come to a compliance is to
suggest that the territory be neu
tralized.
NEW YORK, May 12.â Cramped into

murder or accident is a question which
remains for the police to answer.
Of the thousands who have taken a
deep interest in the, fate of the child,
who disappeared -. from her home ten
days ago, a great majority believe that
a crime has been committed. The.feel
ing against .the Chinaman who has been
under suspicion was so intense to-night
that Captain Herlihy provided a strong
guard to see that no harm befell him:
All of the time that the police of

State Chairman Rowe presented as
temporary chairman of the convention
Hon. Joseph G. Cannon, Speaker of the
National House of Representatives.
With a unanimous Bhout of aye the
convention approved the nomination.
Chairman Cannon spoke briefly." Â¦
"It goes without saying," -he re
marked, ."that the man - selected ' as
CANNON AS CHAIRMAN.
The committee to select delegates at
large to the natiorM convention se
lected Senators Cullom and Hopkins,
Speaker Cannon and Governor Yates.
There were contests in several of the
district caucuses before the convention
was called to order separate sets of
committeemen being named. In calling
the Second district caucus to order a
prominent Louden adherent, T. N.
Jamieson, Naval Officer of the port of
Chicago, who as a political leader was
given a sensational defeat at the,Chi
cago primaries, said: "We who are
about to die salute- you." -
. The Twelfth and Twenty-second dis
tricts indorsed Congressman Hitt of
Illinois for Vice President. Several
other districts indorsed Senator Fair
banks of Indiana.
Governor Yates was. the first of the
prominent figures" to arrive, at the State
convention. He was given a royal ova
tion by his friends. Then came Attor
ney General Hamlin. whose followers
attempted .to outdo the . demonstration
of the Yates men. When Senators Cul
lom and Hopkins and Speaker Cannon
came in arm in arm the convention
arose with one accord and shouted un
til tired. . .
DELEGATES AT LATIGE.
The committee on credentials spent
the whole afternoon in hearing the
county contest cases, deciding two
cases in favor of its own members.
The Lowden-Yates combination, aftÂ»r
unseating the Dineen members from
the Fourth District and the Hamlin
member in the Twenty-flrst District,
had the committee by a vote of 16 to 8
on all questions, and the Yates and
Lowden delegates seated by the State
Committee were given seats In the
convention. For a time the opposi
tion made a fight, but it finally-recog
nized the inevitable and the various
contests were decided by viva voce
vote.
The convention reassembled to
night, but as the credentials com
mittee was -not ready to report, the
convention adjourned until to-morrow.
When the committee on resolutions
met the resolutions adopted by the
district caucuses Indorsing Senator
Fairbanks for- Vice President were
presented, but were subsequently with
drawn, it being stated that Congress
man Hitt would accept the nomina
tion if tendered to him. This was
taken to foreshadow instructions for
Hitt by the convention.
SPRINGFIELD, Ul.. May 12.â All
indications to-day pointed to a big
fight over the seating of . contested
delegates in the temporary organiza
tion of the Republican State Conven
tion. The plans of the anti-Yates-
Lowden forces were carefully guarded.
Appearances seem to show that Yates
and Lowden would be able to control
the organization.
The policy of the Republican party,
he said, was to uphold this system as
against the systems of all other na
tions. â¢ The ' Speaker's peroration in
cluded a recital of the deeds of the
great Republicans of Illinois. The
Speaker coupled the names of Oglesby
and Palmer and the great war Gov
ernor, Yates. which were received with
deafening cheers.
"When the report of the caucuses had
been submitted the convention took a
recess until 5 p. m.
A sensation was created by the dis
covery that a large number of tickets
of admission to the convention hall had
been forged. It is charged that this
was done by the Hamlin men.
Then Mr. Cannon, resuming his formal
speech, defended the policy of protec
tion. His reference- to the late Presi
dent McKinley in" this connection was
loudly cheered. The currency system
perfected by the party he declared to
be better than any save that of France.
The internal commerce of the United
States, he said,; was worth more than
"all the commerce of all the nations of
all the world."
"I would rather have that,"' he re
marked,-"than the yellow jacket of a
Chinese mandarin." (Laughter and
cheers.) â¢

AUSTIN. Texas. May 12.â Captain
W. J. McDonald, the commander of a
company of Texas Rangers, arrived
here to-day from a section of East
Texas, -where he has been for the past
five months running down murderers.
In that time he and five members of
hfs company arrested fifteen men
charged with murder. They are all In
jail and under indictment for the
crimes.
Captain McDonald reported to Gov
ernor Lanaham to-day that there is
enough work in the four "counties
where he and bis men have been to
keep the whole ranger force of the
State busy for several months. He
states that he never saw such a disre
gard for human life as exists among
the people of Trinity, Walker. Madison
and Leon counties. Men are shot down
from ambush upon the slightest provo
cation and the local peace officers have
been powerless to put a stop to the
carnival of crime which has disgraced
that section for many years.
In his Investigations in Trinity Coun
ty, Captain McDonald says he learned
that more than thirty murders had
been committed in that county during
the last few years, very few of which
became publicly known. MÂ»n of prom
inence and wealth are involved in these
crimes. They seem to be good citizens
in every respect except that they seem
to care nothing for shedding human
blood.

Nothing has been given out regarding

Vice Admiral Chouknin, it is an
nounced, has been appointed to com

LIAOYANG. May 12.â The train
which left \ Port Arthur at the time of
the resumption of communication ar
rived here to-day. A passenger said:
"Life at Port Arthur goes on quietly,
and there are . plenty of provisions
there.
Nearly 25,000 men were employed
daily on the work of constructing the
port and town. The total, population
had been estimated at about 60,000,
mostly' Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and
Russians.
Viceroy Alexieff has telegraphed to
the Emperor announcing that the Rus
sians have blown up the docks and
piers at Port Dalny, Liaotung Penin
sula, presumably to render more dif
ficult a Japanese landing at that point.
Later telegrams received indicate
that the whole of Port Dalny has been
destroyed by the Russians.
Port Dalny, on Talienwan Bay, on
the east coast of the Liaotung Penin
sula, was Intended by Russia to be the
chief commercial emporium of its east
ern dominions. An edict providing for
its construction was issued by the Rus
sian Emperor July 30. 1899, and Port
Dalny, fully equipped with all modern
improvements, docks, warehouses and
railroad facilities, was opened to com
merce in December, 1S01.
Talienwan Bay is one of the finest
deep-water harbors on the Pacific. It
is free from ice in winter time and
ships drawing thirty feet of water
can enter at low tide without difficulty
and without the aid of pilots can sail
or. eteam alongside the immense docks
and i)lers, whero,., their cargoes can be
leaded into railroad, ckrs 'and. run .di
rect for 6000 'miles into the. City of St.
Petersburg. Five large piers had been
constructed, each supplied with nu
merous railroad tracks and Immense
warehouses and elevators, gas, electric
lights and water and. a large break
water was being constructed bo that
ships could lie at the piers and load
and unload regardless of weather.
Docks for foreign vessels, steam and
sailing, extended between the piers and
along the shore for two miles. There
were two first-class dry docks, one in
tended for ordinary oceali . steamers
and the other designed to accomodate
the largest vessels of war or commerce.
Over $6,000,000 had been expended on
the harbor system before the end of
1902, and it was estimated that the cost
of completing the works would be near
ly 520,000,000. but this does not in any
way represent the total . cost of the
erection of this great commercial port,
which.with Port Arthur, distant about
twenty miles, was leased by the Chi
nese Government to Russia in 1898. -'

i WASHINGTON, May. 12:â The British
Government has become Involved in the
labor troubles In Colorado. That Gov
ernment makes it a point to look after
the humblest British subject, so when
It happened that In the troubles at Tel
luride, Colo., Launcelot Collins, a Brit-'
Isher and a non-union miner, was killed
by strikers, aB It was alleged, the near
est British Consul, at Denver, started
an investigation and reported the case
to the British embassy here. Sir Mor
timer Durand, finding , that one of the
allegations was that the man was kilted
for lack of proper protection by the
authorities, called' the, atetntion of the
Stale Department to the matter.
The. department' In turn forwarded
the Embassador's note to the Governor
of 'Colorado, and the latter has now ex
plained that owing to the existence of
martial-Jaw in Telluride it Is not pos
sible; to make the legal investigation
required to develop a satisfactory an-
Bwer to the .British note. It is expected
that further proceedings will be taken
when the labor troiibles in Colorado are
at an end, and if It should appear that^
the British complaint is well founded
an application will be made to Con

The President not only has approved
the report and its recommendations,
but he has directed that the recom
mendations be carried Into effect. He
will not remove Postmaster Van Cott.
as It is not regarded that the investi
gation has shown that ground for re
moval exists. Whether Van Cott will
be reappolnted at, the expiration of his
term, about ten months hence, will be
determined at that time.
Richard Van Cott. a son of the post
master, the investigation showed, prac
tically has been directing the affairs
of the New York poBtofflce. His con
nection with the office is considered in
the report at length. Robb recom
mends that'hls services in the office be
dispensed with. Although it is not al
leged that he has been guilty of ab
solute wrongdoing, it is deemed wiser
that his connection with the office
should cease.
The report shows that Postmaster
Van Cott himself has been entirely, in
nocent of any intentional wrongdoing.
Some administrative defects which
have been continued from the last ad
ministration of the office were discov
ered. They have been corrected. It Is
said authoritatively that no evidence
of criminality was disclosed by the
investigation. Such irregularities as
were discovered â and they did not, it
is said, involve the integrity of Post
master Van Cottâ are presented fully
In Robb's report. Recommendations
are made which will prevent; the re
currence of these Irregularities and ad
ministrative defects in .the future. -
â¢ The report - disclosed (! the -fact.- that
Whitfleld Van *Cott, a brother of the
postmaster, was employed five years
ago as an examiner or inspector of
mail boxes. His employment, the In
vestigation showed, .was illegal. The
salary paid him for his services In such
capacity has been refunded to the Gov
ernment. â¢ ' â¢'â¢â¢'â¢Â¦

SACRAMENTO. May 12.â The Su

all week, adjourned for the term at
noon to-day, to meet again in San
Francisco in July. Toward the close
of the session Associate Justices Shaw
and Angellottl strolled down to the Su
perior Court to see how justice is dealt
out here. The Harry Eldrldge murder
case was on, and some point of law
arose which caused Justice Shaw to
express a view, from which Justice An
gellotti dissented. The two Justices
were absorbed in their contention when
Bailiff WIttenbrock turned around and
rapping loudly on his desk Warned the
learned jurists that if they didn't keep
quiet he would put them out. The Jus
tices ,were subdued by the command,
and then being recognized by Presiding
Judge Gaddls there was a general ex
change of greetings.

SAN JOSE, May 12.â The new Union
High School at Campbell, erected by
the districts of Campbell, Union, Cam
brian and Hamilton, was dedicated this
afternoon. Citizens and pupils crowded
the .building to witness the dedicatory
exercises. A fine musical programme
was rendered and Dr. Benjamin Ide
Wheeler delivered the dedication ad
dress. The Rev. J. F. Jenness asked an
invocation. Contractor George Whit
ney then turned over the keys of the
building to Dr. M. J. Gates, the presi
dent of the Board of Trustees, who ac
cepted them in a short speech: Dr.
.Charles N. Cooper, in a few appropri
ate remarks, presented the school with
a flag, and this was accepted on behalf
ot the school by Professor Bennett of
the State Normal School. The subject
of Dr. Wheeler's address was "The
American High School," He treated it
1 in relation to the university and the
grammar school and claimed that it
should be made a preparation for life
rather than for college. A palm' tree
was planted by Dr. Wheeler after the
ceremones were completed.
The new building will occupy an en
tire block. It will be within a short
distance of the court house, only a few
blocks from all of thS bis banks and will
permanently bring business to a sec
tion which, in former days, was the
center of the business part of the city.
As a result of the decision to accept
the site another $1,000,000 building will
be erected Just across the street. The
triangular Temple block is to be razed
and a husre office building, similar In
shape tcr the famous Flatlron building
of New York, will be built.
LOS ANGELES, May 12.-On recom
mendation of Supervisor of Buildings
J. W. Robe*3 of San Francisco, Secre
tary Shaw of the Treasury Department
has formally accepted the offer made
by a syndicate of Los Angeles capital
ists to give the Government a free site
fcrr the proposed new postofflce build
ing for Los Angeles, which, now that
the purchase of a site has been elimin
ated, will cost in the neighborhood of
$1,000,000. The site offered to the Gov
ernment is that of the old "Downey
block at Temple and Springs streets;
one of the oldest business buildings In
the city. Opposition to this selection
was made by persons who desired the
new postofflce to be placed farther
south in the line along which the busi
ness section of the city appears to be
expanding. Other free sites were of
fered, but none of them were as fav
orable as the one accepted.
WASHINGTON, May. 12.â The

A plank against instructions was in
cluded in the platform, as also were
demands for economy in public ex

INDIANAPOLIS. Ind.. May 12.â The
most interesting -Democratic State Con
vention since 1892, when Cleveland and j
Isaac P. Gray contested for control ;ofj
the Indiana delegation to 'the. National
Convention, was held to-day. The,, sole
purpose of the convention was to elect

delegates that were in the convention,

The feeling of the delegates: was in

wrought to a high pitch of determina

In the Claypool Hotel 'assembly-room
by Rev. Sam Small of Georgia and C.

i. ..The convention instructed the thirty

district delegates are:
It is expected that Sonoma County
will give McKinlay a record-breaking
majority next November. There win be

COXVILYTIOX PROGRAMME.
All Bigns point to smooth sailing of
the Republican â¢ craft at Sacramento
next week. Judge A. G. Burnett of So
noma will probably be chairman of the
convention. He was slated for delegate
from the Second District to the Na
tional convention, but ' In order to
smooth the way for the nomination of
Duncan E. McKinlay of Santa Rosa
for Congress in that district he surren
dered all claims to represent the Second
at Chicago.
There is gossip to the effect that M.
F. Tarpey of Alameda, Frank H. Gould
of San Francisco, Joseph Simons of
L.os Angeles and James II. Budd of
Stockton will be chosen as delegates at
large to the Democratic National Con
vention. Among others mentioned as
available for a trip to St. Louis are H.
N. de Witt. Yreka; Thomas Bair. Eu

Fox. Sacramento; J. B. Sanford. Ukiah;

Isidore Dockweiler is due from the
south with a fresh coat of warpaint
without a yellow streak in the red
tlnpe. He bÂ«-ars a commission from the
vinterrifled Democrats of his district
to njjht Hearst to a finish.

"but not conspicuous seat In the Hearst

Others of the Yolo delegation are In the
Hearst wagon or climbing to pet in.
Gavin McNab so far has done nothing,
and Tom Geary has been helping him.
GOSSIP OF DKl.EOATES.
Barney Murphy and ex-Governor
Budd are in the Hearst band wagon,
and Frank Gould is looking wistfully
at a vacant seat alongside of Tarpey.
Franklin K. l^ane will walk rather than
ride in the. wag-on. James D. Phelan
has already taken a section in a Pull
man car and will be 2000 miles away
when the Democratic forces clash near
the old battle-ground of Tripe Hill.
Disinterested spectators would not be
surprised if a rlash between Gavin
Mi Nab and M. F. Tarpey should take
place at Santa Crus. Politicians can
not believe that McNab. whose control
of the local organization can hardly be
QueFtioned. will surrender everything
to the Hearst forces. Tarpey surely ex
pects the San Francisco delegation to
fall into line for Hearst and will hard
ly be satisfied with a simple resolution
commendatory of Hearst. -
CIJVSH IS DUE
There Is a wide diversity of opinion
fonctrnlnK the outcome of the fore
shadowed contest in the Democratic
State convention at Santa Crux.
At Hearst headquarters In the Grand
Hotel word Is Riven out that the reso
lution instructing the California dele
gation to support Hearst at the St.
I^iuis convention will not encounter
formidable opposition. In other camps
ot the party the assertion is made that
u majority of the delegates will resist
lnstrurtkn. The peculiar attitude of
the San Francisco delegation of 1C8
TvembTs enpage special attention
Leaders of the local organization who
made up the list nf delegates in each
Assembly district are confident that the
delegation cannot be stampeded or per
suaded to the Indorsement of any pol
icy that would work injury to the par
ty in the coming national contest.: In
â¢ â¢ther words it lx contended that the
San Francisco delegates are goinj? to
Spr.ta Cruz with a firm determination
to maintain the principle? of the party.
It Is said that a caucus will not be nÂ»
<;ulrfd. as each district has a leader
and every leader knows his business.

Increasing hardships and very real
distress are the portion of the unfor
tunate'foreigners who elected to remain
in the vicinity of Vladivostok, accord
ing to P. Crompton of that city, who
was among the passengers on the Em
press of India, which has Just arrived
here. All foreigners were requested to
leave at the outbreak of the war unless
thoroughly well provisioned. Quite a
number, including many Japanese, re
mained rather than sacrifice their busi
ness Interests, but quickly learned that
their proven possession of sufficient
supplies to meet the governmental re
quirement was but regarded as an in
vitation to the Russian troops to plun
der, them wantonly.
Virtually all the Japanese, with many
others, were forced to flee to Hab
orovsk, the manager of the Russo-
Chinese Bank of Vladivostok leading
the exodus. There the little colony of
refugees is facing slow starvation, such
food supplies as are available being
held for military uses and only secur
able by civilians at fabulous prices.

ST. PETERSBURG. May 12.-â -;The
following statement has been officially

"The war which' broke out in spite
of the peaceful Intentions of Russia
found the finances of the empire, in
a satisfactory position. The effective
capital of the exchequer, which at the
beginning of the year amounted to
182.000,000 rubles, has been more than
doubled up to the present by reason
of the diminution of the budget ex
penses. Now the whole sum at the dis
posal of the exchequer exceeds 300,000,
000 rubles. t
"Despite this, the war expenditure
must be very considerable, and on this
account it has been thought prudent to
discover a new method for providing
funds. These funds might be borrowed

sian fortresses and military depots, a
plot against the life of M. von
Plehwe, the Russian Minister of the
Interior, of a plot against the- life. -of
the Russian Emperor. Possibly the
reports originated in the vague rumors

DENY ANARCHIST PLOT.
During the engagement Japanese
sharpshooters picked off several Rus
sian officers.
These troops came from Liaoyang nnl
were^covering twenty-five miles a day.
Prisoners say that the force had pro
visions for only twelve days and thai
half the men refused to fight.
It is learned from the highest source
that the Emperor Is exceedingly anx
ious to go to the front. To his inti
mates recently he has spoken much on
the subject, but he realized that condi
tions of state demand his presence at
home. Nevertheless, it is now not con
sidered impossible that he will follow
the example of all the Romanoff dynas
ty during this last century and un
dergo his baptism of fire. To fight with
th" army is one of the traditions of his
housp. Should he finally conclude .to
go, the Emperor, would not assume
active command of the troops, but
would have an imperial headquarters,
taking with him all the members of
his military cabinet. Being on the spot
the Emperor would more easily advise
General Kuropatkin In the event of
any question of great military moment
which he might desire to submit to his
Majesty.
The Emperor will go to Moscow Sat
urday to pray for victory at the Trin
ity Sergius Monastery, and thence,
after a few days, to Kharkoff, to bid
farewell to the Tenth and Seventeenth
Army Corps, previous to their depart
ure for the Far East.
A general attached to the head
quarters' staff, whom I asked to-day
what another defeat for the Russian
troops would mean, replied:
"Merely prolongation of the war."
The Bourse to-day took a roseate
view of the situation. There was a
brisk rally. Four per cent funds jumped
a point. This unusually cheerful spirit
Is shown In spite of the knowledge that
a Japanese division is nearing Hal
cheng. and heavy artillery Is being
landed by the Japanese with a view to
the bombardment of Port Arthur,
while Russian artillecv is being rap-
Idly removed from Newchwang and
Yinkow.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 12.â A mys
tery which the most skilled military
experts have been baffled to solve is
how it was that the Japanese cut off
Port Arthur and how soon after com
munication was again opened. The
matter has been explained to me by
an officer of the intelligence depart
ment who said It was simple.
The railway was never cut by the
Japanese. All the force were occupied
in carefully completing operations for
a difficult landing under adverse cir
cumstances in a typhoon at Pitzewo.
Meanwhile Hunchuses. who appeared
on all sides, made 'a raid to cut off
communications. The damage they
were able to do was slight and was
Quickly mended. A wonderful tale on
this, published In the Journal, is a pure
invention in view of the fact that a
military train full of important muni
tions got to Port Arthur.
Officer in Czar's Army Sheds Light on
a Port Arthur Mystery.
"On May 9 a squadron of the
enemy's cavalry approached within
fifteen miles of Wufungtien, but turned
back on meeting our scouts.
"The village of Tantsiafang was
found occupied by a detachment con
sisting of cavalry, artillery and infan
try. Cannon fire was opened by the
Japanese on coming into contact with
our small detachment, which had
penetrated within three miles of
Pitzewo." "
"A Japanese detachment of four or
five companies on May 9 attacked our
posts near Shihei, killing four of our
frontier guards and wounding eight.
"On, May 8 the Japanese left the
railway line and communication with
Port Arthur was re-established.
"According to Chinese information
20,000 Japanese landed east of Pitzewo
with field artillery and siege guns and
Pitzewo was occupied by 1500 men.
"Our detachment having covered
seven miles northwest of Pitzewo, ad
vanced to within three-quarters of a
mile of a fortification under con
struction, which was occupied by a
Japaneese infantry company. During
a fusillade one of the guards was

"Japanese scouts appeared at 8
o'clock on the morning of May 6 at
Polandlen and then Japanese Infantry
came up and opened fire on a mail
train bound north, but without result.
"The Japanese evacuated Polandien
May 7, probably because a great storm
began to gather" and also because they
feared being cut off.
"A small detachment of Russian cav
alry effected a reconnoissance toward
Sanchilipu. Pitzewo and Wufungtien,
covering sixty-five miles. The railway
if? still free of the enemy.
"The Japanese on the evening of May
5 sent two regiments toward Tansia
fang and also two detachments south
and west of the points -of disembarka
tion. ' "- ' â¢ : Â¦ ' ! â¢ ,- .
"Having fulfilled its task our Bmall
detachment retired on the evening of
May 5, but met en route a superior
force of the enemy and took another
road. The detachment was pursued by
the Japanese for a distance of six mlle3
and our casualties .were one sharp
shooter wounded.
"On May 4 some sixty Japanese
transports and warships ..appeared at
sea between Pitzewo and Cape Termin
al. Detachments of sharpshooters were
sent to reconnoitre and a small detach
ment of infantry was sent., The troops
sent to reconnoitre announced that the
Japanese were landing In KInchau Bay
near the mouth of the Tchengyu River
and were posting a division of 10.000
men in the neighboring -villages. The
Russian population was withdrawn
from Pitzewo.
ST. PETEP.SBURG. May 12.â Gen^
eral Karkevitch, in a dispatch to the
general staff, says that on May 8 part
of the Japanese vanguard appeared in
the valley of the Sedzo River and that
a copsiderable body of the enemy con
tinues to occupy Do-uanmyo. Another
detachment, composed â apparently of
one battalion of infantry and half a
squadron of cavalry, is situated about
five miles north of Takushan.
Other information indicates, that on
May 10 a Japanese force of 100,000 in
fantry and tifty guns, chiefly of the
mountain type, halted for the day at
Hungkiapuszo and advanced on May
11 toward Siuyen. Another telegram
received by the general staff from Gen T
eral Karkevitch says:
100.000,000 rubles, but in order to avoid
expanding the effective capital at the
risk of a disturbance of the money in
circulation and, as the Government
wishes to see Russia at the end of the
war in the same financial position as
before the outbreak of hostilities, the
Finance Minister has considered "it
necessary to have recourse to an ex
ternal loan.
"By Imperial order of May 12 for an
increased war fund the issue of a 5
per cent external loan for a short term
has been decided upon with a nominal
capital of 300,000,000 rubles, or 800,000,
0P0 francs, under the title of 5 per cent
stated exchequer bonds of 1904, free
forever from Russian taxes. On May
14, 1909, these bonds will be redeem
able at the issue price and must be
presented for redemption in Paris.
"The flotation of the loan is entrust
ed to The Netherlands Bank, the Credit
Lyonaise and Hottlnger & Co. of
Paris."
The statement published in the for
eign press that after this loan another
will be issued In Germany is officially
declared to be without foundation.

the second on the lower course of the

"There la no precise Information yet
to hand regarding the enemy's forces
which have landed at Pitzewo."
He said the fortress was practically
impregnable, adding that there was a
triple row of forts around the Port Ar
thur glacis, each position being fronted
by a moat, with a hedge of barbed wlrÂ«
beyond, with bomb-proofa behind all
the batteries. The officer further de
clared that they had plenty of supplies
and ammunition and that the garrison
was In excellent spirits and confident
of being able to hold for nine months or
a year against any number of the
enemy, even if they possessed siege
guns. General Kuropatkin offered
General Stoesael reinforcements, but
the latter declined them, saying he had
enough men and did not care to run
the risk of an epidemic as the result of
overcrowding.
Information reaching the general
staff indicates that there is much sick
ness among the enemy's troops in Ko
rea; typhus, especially, is said to be
rampant.

WASHIXGTOX, May 12. â Appar
ently to avoid the risk of Russian mail
falling into the enemy's hands the
. Russian Government has requested
'the United States to change the
route of all mails sent from or
through this country for Manchuria
;ind Siberia. In accordance with this
notification ihÂ«? following general or

throughout the country, was issued

"Hereafter and until further orders
â¢ mails destined for Siberia and Man
churia should be forwarded to New
York, to be included in mails for Rus
elac inkdp ud at the Xew York office."
The sisrnificance of this action lies
in the fact that until now the mails
for Siberia and Manchuria have been
. sent over the Siberian railway, going
first to San Francisco and thence via
Chinese or Japanese ports to a Sibe
rian railway point.

* After a cruise along the eastern coast
of Liaotungr Peninsula, the dispatch
t>oÂ«t Fawan returned to port this
morning:. The whole of the coast in
the vicinity of Port Arthur is carefully
patrolled by the Japanese fleet. Tor
pedo-boats are protecting the landing
.Of troops.
The Fawan was stopped three times
by Japanese cruisers. Officers were
eert on board and thÂ«* dispatch boat's
papers were examined. The boarding
officer invariably acted with the great
est courtesy, and. having satisfied him
tell that all was correct, Immediately
released the boat.

The Fawan was forbidden to approach
" the coast and warned against floating
mines. Six of these'dangerous neigh

Fighting is in progress daily on the
peninsula, but the details are kept
secret. It is said, however, that the
. Russians are offering very ineffective
resistance. One of the Japanese of
ficers who boarded the Fawan said he
understood from some of the army

as fighters.

formerly the wife of Joseph Haile, a
Justice of the Peace at Vacaville. She
met Rumble in March, 1900, and . he
induced her to buy fifty chares of
Orange Mining Company's stock., He
represented to her according to her
testimony, that accrued dividends of
2 per cent per month, amounting to
$60, would be paid to her. She there
upon handed him $100 in. gold and he
Immediately returned $60 to "her. She
subsequently exchanged the fifty shares
for 100 "shares of Sunset Mining Com
pany's stock. In July, 1901, ehe ac
cepted employment in Rumble's office
as a stenographer and received .month
ly dividends regularly of 2 per cent
on her stock up. to and including Janu
ary, 1903, after which date she left
his employment. After she left
Rumble's office the dividends ceased,
for what reason she did not know.'
There was an agreement between her
and Rumble whereby she was to re
ceive 10 per cent commission on all
stqck sold to persons with whom she
corresponded. She ' sent " about 900 .
letters through, the mail and made only
one sale, that of 200 shares to H. A.

EXCURSION LEAVES TO-DAY
Arthur M. Burns, a newspaper re
porter, was called to identify scraps of
paper he had found in front of the res
idence of Mauritz Meinenberg, at 4800
Mission street, and pasted together.
Pieced out. the letter bore the address
of .Leon Soeder, and the Maier girls
testified that it was the front of an
envelope addressed to the defendant at
the number of Meinenberg's residence.
They said he called at 10 o'clock on the
morning of January 11. when Blaise's
body, was found, and told them that he
was worried about his brother-in-law,
because Blaise had not come to the
room on the previous night. About 5
o'clock on the 7 same evening Soeder
THOSE MISSING LKTTERS.
The tv.o Maier girls, who crossed the
Atlantic with Soeder and Blaise, were
pifcturesque but rather unimportant
witnesses. Mies Annie Maier could not
talk English, but her sister, who ha3
been married since her advent to this
city and whose name Is now Mrs.
Hencer. dispensed with the aid of an
interpreter. During Miss Annie Maier's
examination Judge Cook, who Is thor
oughly conversant with the German
language, frequently interrupted the
intrpreter and corrected the purport of
the questions and answers.
Both young women testified that they
crossed from Havre to New York on
the steamship La Touralne in company
with Soeder and Blaise. On board
Soeder was esteemed a wealthy man,
and it was understood that he was
bearing all of the expenses of Blaise's
passage. At the same time Soeder
never claimed to them that he was
other than a cook by occupation, and
he told them that he expected to take
Bfaise in a kitchen with him and teach
him the business of cooking.
against the defendant because of his
failure to make good his promise of
securing $10,000 or more from the estate
of his uncle in Germany.
called again at the house and the en
velope was delivered to him. It was
suggested by Miss Annie Maier that it
might contain news from Blaise. Soeder
tore the envelope open and found three
letters contained in It. He declined to
read the letters at that time and put
them away in his pocket. The envelope
he threw in the yard and the scattered
bits were subsequently collected. â¢ The
prosecution purposes to show that the
address was in Soeder's handwriting
and that he wrote the letters himself
and addressed them to. himself. What
became of the inclosed letters has never
been ascertained.
Other witneses examined were Mau
ritz Meinenberg, uncle of the two young
women who crossed the ocean with
Blaise, and Soeder and at whose home
they stopped in this city; J. N. Kll
gariff of the Pacific Mutual Life In
surance Company and Dr. William R.
Kreusess of the same company. The
testimony of the latter two was simply
in corroboration of other testimony in
troduced regarding Soeder's applica
tions for insurance on the life of Blaise.
The hearing of the case will continue
at 10 o'clock this morning.
MISS CATHERINE FLATLEY. THE YOUNG WOMAN, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN
MONEY TO MARRY WHOM THE PROSECUTION CLAIMS LEON SOEDER
MURDERED HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW. JOSEPH BLAISE.
Trusting that your disinterested work will
be crowned with success, we await with pa
tience tht day when the feeling for beauty
will be paramount to apparent commercial
necessity p. s. HEAL.Y,
Secretary f f the . Fnirmount Association.
A wise oollcy would and will preserve these
boautiful elevation* by an artistic and scien
tific system of street outlines, so that the
curved lines â the line of beauty â which gives
reel to the eye, would alao give the easiest
acc*sÂ« to the territory that awaits and yet
repels the home -builder.
Now that your association has had the wis
dom and enterprise to invite to our city the
enlightened architect whose experience In
rectifying the mistakes of the old and hap
hazard builders of Kastern cities, let us hope
that he may do for San Francisco what an
other architect, secured by the enlightened
liberality cf Mr*. Phebo Hearst, has done for
our Stoto university, viz.: that he formulate
a comprehensive plan for- the realignment of
our streets, wherever it In found that their
prÂ«BÂ«nt lines' Interfere with the natural beauty
and accessibility* cf the land. Mr. Burnham
should be asked to select sites for aquariums,
auditoriums, mus:ums, parks and other im
provements for the recreation and enlighten
ment of the people. â¢ And these improvements
and civilising Influences should not be exclu
alvcly conlined to the districts north of Market
*trÂ«-et. There are things of morw'preMlng need
than a triumnhal arch at ..the .park entrance.
Small parks and breathing places are now con
sidered of absolute' nectsilty in every large
community. They- are onses of health and
safety th.it the people will have if their mu
nicipal afTalra are wisely administered.
. We may say here in passing that in thÂ» dis
trict from which this communication emanates
la situated the most available and perfect site
for an outdoor theater existing on the whole
IÂ«-uln*ula. We refer, to the depression that is
situate on the northeast slope of Fairmount
Hill, Just wi>st -of the corner of Castro and
Thirtieth street*. The Indenture In the hill
side at the point named - forms a natural
amphitheater. We respectfully ask your asso
ciation to visit â¢ thÂ» loculltv referred to and
confirm by observation what we have barely
outlined.
In this connection we deplore the mercenary
vandalism that has obtained in the past under
tha. guise of public . improvements â Improve
ments that were made for purely commercial
reasons. We now see that those improve
ments ara as useless as they are unsightly;
that they are defacements of the city's con
tour; made by people who had no conception
of esthetic needs and the injury that they
were Inflicting upon the fair outline of the me
tropolis of the Pacific Statm.
} They wero ijtnorant.of the value, of beauty
as a financial asiet even In the life of a mu
nicipality. As examples of this thoughtless
mutilation of our landscape, we refer to tha
Second-street cut, the destruction of the east
ern slope of Telegraph" Hill, the eyesore at
Sixteenth street And the, hideous excavation at
Twenty-sixth and Dome las street*, and last,
but not least, the -proposed mutilation of the
beautiful contour of Fairmount Hill by allow
ing the location of a quarry and the erection
of a. rock-crufchlnir*plant on the south line of
Thirtieth street. Immediately w*st of Castro.
These mutilations of a city's outline would
rot be allowed In any Eastern city of similar
population, area and metropolitan aspirations.
We dealr^ especially to call the attention of
your association to the range of hills that runs
nearly the whole length of the peninsula upon
which our city is situated. Street lines have
b:?n run on most of these hills as If they were
prairies,- run at right angles without regard
to rradient or beauty, thus hindering settle
ment and destroying the natural outlines of
these beautiful elevations.

Defendant's counsel gingerly handled
Miss Flatley and forbore to question
her regarding the relations existing be
tween herself and Soeder. Soeder
sneered several times while Miss Flat
ley was testifying, and frequently gave
& movement of the throat that indi
cated his disappointment in the
woman's hostile attitude toward him.
General Salomon succeeded in bringing
out some fans that tended to show
that Miss Flatlev had an animus
She also testified that he had tele
graphed her from New York in the
latter part of October, 1503, stating
that he hnd been robbed and asked for
$100. which she sent him. A letter fol
lowed from Soeder a few days later,
detailiEj? the circumstances of the al
leged robbery, saying that a watch was
taken from him on a lonely road "Hear
Rochester. N T . Y., and a diamond ring;
which the prosecution claims was
pawned at a local - pawnshop after
Boeder's return from his trip to Ger
many, the pn,-ceeds of which were used
in th? payment of the insurance on the
life of Blaise.
HIS CLAIM OF ROBBERY.
Mis? Catherine Flatley was the main
witness in the hearing yesterday. She
was called to the stand An the morning
and told of her acquaintance with Leon
Soeder. She met him in March, 1903,
ar.d saw him frequently from that time
until he went to Alaska the summer
following. A desire to marry Miss Flat
ley is one of the alleged motives that
prompted Soeder to kill his brother-in
.l?.w after he had secured $13,000 insur
ance on the latter's life. Miss Flatley
toM of- the presents she had received
from Soeder. consisting c-f a diamond
ring, a breastpin and earrings, valued
at ?T00.
"There is a threat of the prosecution.
That was published in The Call, to the
effect that a cellmate of Soeder had
olicited a confession from him. I cmly
hope that the prosecution attempts to
introduce such evidence. It may be a
u>rpedo-boat for them, but I have a
torpedo-boat destroyer in waiting to
blow it up."'
"I Khali move for a dismissal of the
entire proceedings against Leon Soe
ccr," said General Salomon, "but in
ihÂ«_face of public opinion I scarcely
t-xpect my motic-n to be granted. Be
fore a jury of unprejudiced men I shall
submit the fate of my client. All the
testimony I expect to introduce is that
of Coi!ins, Parker and Leon Soeder. I
am proingr to put the defendant on the
stand and make him tell every act of
his on the night that his brother-in-law
Â«vas murdered. I do not expect that
Judpe Cook will dismiss the case at
the conclusion of the prosecution's tes
timony. I have purposely given the
District Attorney every latitude In the
introduction of testimony in order to
s-how the jury how utterly baseless the
charge of murder is against my
client.
At the lamp post on the corner of
TaykTar.d Union streets Collins is said
to have observed a man. He wore a
full beard and in no way bore a re
sembJanci? to Soeder. Apparently he
understood what Blaise said to him
and the two engaged in conversation.
GoHirs took no- further notice of Blaise
;:nd did rot know whether or not the
two proceeded through tho cut on Tay
lor &trrft. Another tritnesa Salomon
intends to call tu- the stand is W. F.
1'arker. connected with the Hartford
Insurance Company. He speaks Ger
man fluently and held a personal con
versation with Blaise regarding: the in-
he desired to take out. Both of
these witnesses were summoned by the
prosecution, but were not put on the
Ftar.d Curing the preliminary hearing
befcfe Judge Cabaniss.
SOlTDKIt WILL TESTIFY.
General Edward Salomon, chief coun
sel for the de'er.Ee of Leon Soeder, ac
cused of the murder of Jtrseph Blaise,
his bruther-in-law, on tlie night of Jan
uary 10. developed his theory yester
day. It was to the effect that Soeder
wtis as innocent of the crimo as a new
bora babe and that the murder was
cone by others for the purpose erf rob
bery.
Salomon does not expect to prove an
alibi, in the large sense of the word.
He admits that he has no corroborative
-witnesses tu testify that Soeder wes in
another place at the time the crime
was committed. He only intends to
ircpe^rh the testimony of the prosecu
tion. To <Jo this he expects to call to
the stand, Leon Soeder, the defendant
oa the murder charge, and ask him to
tell abc-ut his movements on the night
cf the murder. Then he will call Divi
sion Superintendent Collins of the
Union street lire to prove that he ac
t-osted Biaise at the power-house and
directed hi:n to Jacksoa street.

SAN JOSE, May 12.â A masked
man attempted to hold up the saloon
of Tierny & Dalton on Santa Clara
street, near Orchard, late last night.
The stranger entered the place a short
time before and asked for a drink of
whisky, saying he was sick. He was
ordered out of the saloon and left,
only to return a few minutes later
with a handkerchief tied over his
mouth and nose. He went behind the
bar and when within a foot of Albert
Dalton drew a large revolver and
pointed it at the saloon-keeper's head.
Dalton put his hands on his hips and
the fellow, believing Dalton Intended
to shoot, backed from behind the bar
and ran into the street. Dalton noti
fied the police and Officer Guerin ar
rested a man who answered the de
scription of the would-be highway
man. The suspect is being detained by
the police pending an investigation.

LOS ANGELES, May 12.â Business
moved very slowly in the Methodist
General Conference to-day, and the
events of the day's sessions were dull
and uninteresting to the crowds that
filled the galleries, arid at times failed
even to hold the attention of the dele
gates. The entire morning hours were
taken up in a tiresome discussion of the
report of the committee, on rules of or
der, which occupied part of yesterday's
session. Only once did the delegates
take notice with any degree of unanim
ity, and that was when the two great
est debaters of the body, Dr. J. M.
Buckley of New York and Dr. T. B.
Neely of Philadelphia, exchanged rhet
orical thrusts. 1 It was all over the meth
od of constituting the Judiciary com
mittee. Dr. Buckley wanted power
given to the Bishops to' name five . of
the nineteen members of that important
committee, which was in opposition to
the recommendation of the rules com
mittee, as reported by Dr. Neely. The
committee's report on the section final
ly prevailed. â¢
Immediately after, recess Joseph C.
Hartzell, missionary Bishop to Africa,
read his report to the conference. It
was full of â¢ interesting details of his
work in the "Dark Continent" and
made strong>appeal for additional funds
to prosecute his labors in the Christian
izing of the natives. Statistics showed
a membership of 5000 in Africa. There
are 114 schools, said Bishop Hartzell,
with 650 teachers and 5000 scholars. The
total value of the Methodist church's
property In Africa is $320,000, an- in
crease of $150,000 In the last quadren
niirm.
Bishop Hartzell paid an eloquent
tribute. to the character of the late
Cecil Rhodes. .
VI once. asked Mr. Rhodes," said the
Bishop,: "what was his ambition. He
replied: 'My ambition is to do the
greatest thing for barbarous humanity,

VICTORIA, B. C, May 12. â Mis
sionary passengers by the liner
Empress of India bring advices of an
atrocious massacre on the west coast
of British North Borneo. On March
31, at 10 o'clock at night, aband of 150
rebels from the interior, armed with
guns, parangs, spears and blowpipes,
swept down* upon the little colony at
Kawang railway station, midway be
tween Jesselton and Papar. The band
divided Into two parts, one of a hun
dred remaining concealed as a reserve
on the top of a hill, while the other
rushed down upon * the settlement,
butchered the Inmates of the Chinese
smashed the telephone and killed the
wife and child of the station master,
the latter saving his life by hiding in
the brush.
The murderers then turned their at
tention to the coolies, . killing and
wounding right and left., The English
railway driver was among the victims,
a speedy and terrible end coming to
him and his wife. The carnage then
became general, males, females and
innocent babes being butchered. The
houses and huts in Kampong were
on fire and when nothing was left but
dead bodies , and cruelly wounded peo
ple, ashes and desolation, the murder
ers went their way.
The survivors, one native fireman,
the station master, and a few of the
wounded coolies, ran down the line in
the direction of Jesselton for their lives.
By. putting all steam on the construc
tion engine stationebd there, the ter
rible news was carried to Jesselton.
The total number of killed was one
hundred and thirty. No record Is avail

OFFICIALS OF VALLEJO
SAID TO BE INELIGIBLE
Point Is Raised That Several of Them
Are Drawing Salaries From the.
Federal Government.
VALLEJO, May 12. â There Is a
strong probability of trouble for many
officials of this city who also
hold positions In the Mare Island
navy yard. The charge was made
before the last election that
Mayor Roney, the successful candi
date, was ineligible because of a rule
of the Navy Department that no em
ploye shall hold a salaried office In the
civil government. Mayor Roney is
now said to be. in receipt of a letter
from Congressman Metcalf to the ef
fect that the department has taken
this view of the matter officially, It
Is likely that the Mayor and several
other officials will be forced to give up
either their offices or their positions at
the yard. In the latter event the city
would be put to the expense of an
other election. ;-'-' â¢ * Â¦Â¦_ .'. .

21 48 Center Street, May 12.
Not being familiar with street cars.
Prank Elmlng, 13 years of age, walked
off the platform of a Shattuck-avenu*
car when' it did not- stop in front of
his uncle'e - home last night and re
ceived a fracture of the skull that may
result in his death. The boy is now
lyinff In a semi-conscious condition at
the Fabiola Hospital and the doctors
are awaiting more favorable aevelop
ments before attempting to operate
upon him. The fracture Is in a dan
gerous place on the left side of the
head above the ear.
Only lately the little fellow cam*
from Wayman, Xeb., to take up his
residence with bis uncle. August Elm
ing of 6669 Shattuck avenue. He was
altogether unused to big cities and
whirling electric cars and became con
fused when he took his first trip to
Oakland yesterday afternoon. On the
return trip he asked the conductor to
stop at his house, but the car kept
forging ahead and. not realizing the
danger, he stepped off the platform
into space.
The momentum threw the boy heav
ily against the solid street and the
contact broke his skull. He was re
moved to Fabiola Hospital. .
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, May 12.
Walter E. Hawley, a sophomore in
the College of Commerce at the Uni
versity of California, confessed to-night
that he was an embezzler of $500 be
longing to Mikkelsen & Berry, mer
chant tailors of this city. Hawley had
been for two years in their employ as a
clerk. He made- his confession to John
C. Berry, a member of the firm, in the
presence of Deputy Town Marshal
George Thompson, irr~whose charge the
young man was placed to-night. Haw
ley has not been arrested, but is under
surveillance pending the arrival of his
mother from Los Angeles. She was tel
egraphed for by her son.
Hawley's peculations cover two years
and include petty thefts, largely of col
lections made, on acct-unt of goods he
delivered. His practice had been to de
stroy delivery tags for garments re
paired or cleaned, and thus remove evi
dence of money due the firm on his col
lections. He received $6 a week and
the wages were not sufficient to meet
his ideas of dress and life in the college
town.
LONG SUSPECTED. .
For a long time the firm had realized
something was wrong, but It was not
until two. weeks ago that suspicion was
directed toward Hawley. One Monday
morning S125 was missing from a safe,
where It had been placed the previous
Saturday night. A watch was put
upon Hawley, and the members of the
firm discovered that he had been liv
ing beyond his means. A few days
ago $~3 in marked coins disappeared
from a cash drawer in the tailor shop,
but none of the coins were .found in
Hawley's possession to-night.
Hawley was Feen in the store at 2
o'clock in the morning by Deputy Mar
shal Thompson. Thompson was . on
watch there, peeping through the holes
he had bored through the rear board
ing. Eerry took his suspected clerk
in hand to-night and flatly accused
him of theft. The answer was a com
plete confession of wrongdoing.
AMOUNT MAY BE !LARGE.
Though Hawley will admit to only
J300, the firm believes that the total
amount may reach $1000., Neither Mik
kelsen nor Berry would talk about the
case to-night. Berry said it was a
personal matter between themselves
and j .Hawley. When Deputy Marshal
Thompson was questioned he said that
Hawley was not under arrest, but was
to be kept under. watch .until his rela
tives had made arrangements to settle
the affair. Hawley's residence here is
at 222 i Center street, In rooms over
his employers' store. His home is In
Los Angeles, where his parents re
side. He is about 22 years old.
The town police have begun an in
vestigation concerning the student's
recent action. Suspicion has been di
rected against him as the burglar who
has been operating among stores in
town. The police say Hawley has been
gambling.

OAKLAND, May 12.â The little Thursday
Dancing Club, which was organized early this
season by Mrs. Robert Duncan, gave Its closing
party this afternoon, and the fifty or more
children who were present will have something
to talk about and remember for many a day.
From 4 to 7 o'clock Maple Hall resounded
with the laughter of the merry band, and the
mothers . who looked on seemed to enjoy the
occasion fully as much as the children.
The early part of the afternoon was devoted
to a vaudeville programme, the first half of
which was given by several of the club mem
ber* and the second half by professionals from
Peck's Theater. These last were secured
through the g^neronity of Mr. Ghlrardelli, and
Included Morris Jones. Miriam Mar, Douglas
and Fletcher and Mr. and Mrs. Beverly. ThÂ«
children enjoyed the "coon songs" and dancing
immensely.
Phyllis Capwell gave the opening number
on the children's half of the programme ami
made a "hit" In her very first song, "Ken
tucky. Babe." .. Her "babe" was a tiny black
puppy. Her next song was "Bedella" and,
with jockey cap and whip, she executed a sort
of Irish-coon Jig-step that was most amusing.
One of the prcttitst features of the after
noon was tba fair}' dance by little Flosie
Duncan. Light as a thistle on her small
slippered feet and clad In a fluffy white lace
frock, she truly resembled a dainty inhabitant
of fairyland.
The Highland fling by Bobbie Duncan and
Jeannette Hoagland and another dance by
Carmen Ghtrardelll and Flosie Duncan were
pleasing numbers. The programme closed
with a song and dance â "My Alabama Coon" â
by Phyllis Capwell. accompanied - by fifteen or
twenty children swaying â¢ to the- music and
waving red . lanterns... The effect was very
prettv. Â¦Â¦ Â¦ .
General dancing and a delicious supper oc
cupied the remaining hour. The long table was
beautifully decorated In pink and green, and
bonbons and favors were to be found at each
place. â¢ 'Â¦ '' "* Â¦". - 'Â¦":
Mrs. Duncan was assisted In the role of
chaperon and hostess to-day by Mrs. H. C.
Capwell and Mrs." Joseph Ghirardelll.
Among the children who enjoyed this unique
and delightfur affair were: Claire and Helene
Bond Flosie and Bobble Duncan, Carmen,
Juonita and Elva Ghlrardellf. Hope Matthews.

One of the features of the floral pa
rade on Santa Fe day will be the float
the Board of Trade and the Merchants'
Exchange, which will be in the form
of a locomotive constructed of flowers.
The members of the two commercial
bodies are at work collecting" flowers, a
great many of which will be necessary
for the decoration of the float.
More than one hundred entries have
been received for the parade, and the
members of the committee are confi
dent that the total will reach 250 by
Monday. Among the entries received
to-day were a four-horse tally-ho by
Henry A. Butters, and a phaeton and
pair, a single-horse carriage and a sad
dle horse by Charles Butters. The
tally-ho entered by Henry Butters Is
the same that won the prize at Burlln
game. --The entries of Charles Butters
are Velocity III, single harness, a pair
of imported English colts driven to a
Stanhope phaeton, and geyyid, an Im
ported Arabian stallion, ridden under
saddle. All these horses are from Mr.
Butters' stable at Claremont.
'. Another feature-of the parade will be
the entry of a* pair horse carriage by
John Nicholl. who In 1856 bought' the
land on which Point Richmond now
stands and several years ago sold to
the Santa Fe Company its present
holdings in that town. Mr. Nicholl was
one of those who welcomed the Santa
Fe to Point Richmond, and on Monday
he- will be on the ground to welcome
the company's first train to Oakland.
Chapter three in the triple party con
test over Mrs. Jeanette Desoza, reputed
heirecs, was added to-day when the
young Vicman caused the arrest of Er
win Frost, a private detective, on a
charge of malicious arrest. Frost had
been instrumental, it Is charged, in the
detention of the bride after locating
her on behalf of her father, Charles W.
Bamber.
Frost was released in bonds of $1000.
His arrest followed closely upon that
of his client, Bamber, who was. taken
into custody yesterday on complaint, of
Attorney F. J. Russell. The lawyer who
represents Mrs. Desoza asked a, dis
missal of the charge of disturbing the
peace he had lodged agalnsi his client's
parent and the request was granted by
Police Judge Smith this mc-rning.
Mrs. Desoza appears willing to re
main with her husband despite all of
her father s efforts to win her away.
The halo of a legacy from a grand-'
mother glitters about the girl, who has
not yet reached her majority.
Bamber's Jlght is said to be based on
the averment that Attorney Russell
htrlds a contract with me girl concern
ing her interests in the prospective leg
acy, though the father insists she is
not of legal age and could not sign a
binding contract. â¢Â¦

"What do you want here?"
"Where is Alice street?" queried the

jind headed toward the front yard. He
walked quickly -across the street,
where Miss Eva Yo -ker saw the in

of the trees. Miss Yorker -heard the
stranger say, "Let> get away from

away, and disappeared.
OAKLAND, May 12. â Mrs. E. D.
Yorker, residing at 1383 Harrison

evening on the back :>orch. Barkinff
of a dog attracted Mrs. Yorker's at

The pluck of .Miss Frances Donnel
lan, a nurse !n the employ of Mrs. Rob
ert J. Duncan, in driving away a man
â¢who had entered the house on the pre
tense of being an inspector for the gas
company, saved the house of her em
ployer from Â¦ being robbed yesterday
afternoon during the absence of the
family. Miss Donnellan is very modest
in her account of the experience.
The man gained entrance by telling
the Chinese cook that he was an In
spector employed by the gas company
and wished to look over the gas fix
tures in the house. The Celestial ad
mitted him through the kitchen door
and the man immediately went to the
front of the house and started upstairs
to the second floor. Miss Donnellan's
attention was attracted by the bark
ing of the little house dog and she came
to the head of the stairs and was very
much startled to find the roughly
dressed man coming up. Miss Donnel
lan said: â¢ '

a mother should be a source of joy to all, but the suffering and

Mother's Friend is the only remedy which relieves women of the great

tricity to grant permission to the Cen
tral Light and Power Company to
maintain poles for the stringing of elec
tric wires on Geary street, between
Powell and Stockton, for a period of
thirty days. The poles were erected in
violation of an ordinance on a permit
signed by President Schmitz of the
Board of Public Works. Messrs. Levi
son and Vaughan of the Geary Street
Improvement Club explained that it
was intended to improve the condition
of the thoroughfare, and urged the
granting of the privilege. They will
confer with Chief Hewitt of the De

their protests before the committee.
Holmes admitted that he did not in
tend to build on the lot for some time

the matter should lay over until the
bond issue involving the improvement
of Telegraph Hill has been settled by

The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday recommended the passage of
an ordinance providing for a grant to
the Southern Pacific Company of the
right to construct twenty-seven spur
and connecting tracks with the ter
minals of its bay shore cut-off line at
the county line. Jere T. Burke, on be
half of the company, agreed that all
the terms of the ordinance would be
complied with, these including the pav
ing of the roadways between the tracks
and the erection of such bridges across
intersecting streets as may be deemed
necessary.
There were large congregations at
St. Mary's Cathedral and at St. Dom
inic's Church. St. Ignatius Church and
St. Mary's (Paulist) Church and the
services were profoundly impressive.
The Rev. W. M. Reilly conducted the
services at St. Paul's Church, Califor
nia street, near Fillmore, and at all
the Episcopal churches the day was
observed.
For a simile the reverend gentleman
said that "John Brown may lie amould
ering in his grave, but his soul goes
marching on." This, he said, is seen
in the political world, from where great
men disappear, yet others always arise
to take their place, even with a double
portion of their spirit.
There was an evening service at
Grace Church at 4 o'clock.
At Trinity Church the Rev. Frederick
W. dampen. D. D., officiated at the
Ascension day service and at St. Luke's
the Rev. Burr M. Weeden, the rector,
officiated at each service.
Last Sunday the rector, the Rev.
David J. Evans, reminded his congre
gation to observe all the great holy
days of the church and the members
were in attendance in goodly number
at the service yesterday.
In an impassioned sermon the Rev.
Mr. Evans said that the man who is
left in the world is in far more serious
position than the man leaving it. Great
and good men. he said, really never die
because the real part of them, which
is the spirit, is always bequeathed to
a successor.
Ascension day was observed in many
of the churches of the city yesterday
and the congregations were generally
larger than In previous years. At
Grace Church, California and Stockton
streets, the first service was at 6:30 in
the morning and at the 11 o'clock ser
vice there were beautiful and impres
sive numbers rendered by the ladies'
choir under the direction of Organist
William Holt.
The flag was ordered displayed from
schoolhouses Tuesday, June 14, 1904,
this date being the one hundred 'and

crease over 1303. , The cost of tire
work so far aggregates $6800.
The board is now issuing pamphlets
containing the plan of appointment of
teachers in the competitive examina
tion to be held June 11, 1904. The
plan was formally adopted at the
meeting and is identical with that of
last year, except that it provides for a
morning and afternoon session, at each
of which five questions will be pro
pounded. , The oral examinations of
those who take the written test will
begin June 13. Several applications
wore filed.
BOARD ISSUES PAMPHLETS.
Resolved ' The Board of Education shall con
duct annually a competitive examination for
appointments to the substitute list. Alt teach
ers desiring to enter snch examinations shall
be required to take both a written and an oral
examination on the practice and theory of edu
cation and such other topics as may from
time to time be announced.
As the system of appointing teach
ers to the graded classes of the San
Francisco School Department for the
past two years has through the
medium of civil service examinations
proved an unqualified success, - the
board decided to make it a permanent
feature and adopted a resolution as
follows:
Resolved. That Arthur W. Scott. M. D., be
and he Is hereby appointed principal of the
Girls' High School, subject to two years" pro
bation, the tame to take effect upon the con
ditions contained in the resignation of Elisha
Brooks, as principal of said school, becoming
operative.
NAMES SUCCESSOR.
Resolved That the resignation of -Elleha
Brooks, as principal of the Girls' High School,
be and is hereby accepted with regret, the
same to take effect July -25. 1804, subject to
the condition that Mr.- Brooks be placed on the
retired list In order that he may avail him
self of the provisions of the act to create and
administer a public school teachers' annuity
and retirement fund.
Whereas. Mr. Brooks assumed said prin
clpalship July 1, 1892. and has since that
time by his scholarly attainments and the
exercise of ability of a iiigh administrative
order not only entrenched himself in the af
fection of the scholars who attended his school,
but also commanded the respect and confi
dence of all with whom he came In contact
as principal of said school; therefore be It
The Board of Education yesterday
formally accepted the resignation of
Elisha Brooks as principal of the
Girls' High School and- appointed Dr.
A. W. Scott to the vacancy, as, already
announced., The proceedings of the
board on the matter are contained in
the following resolutions:
Whereas Elisha Brooks, principal of the
Girls 1 High School has submitted his resig
nation of said position to this department, and
Braunhart hotly told â¢ Schmitz to
keep a civil tortgue ,in his head; when
further argument was; prevented by
Chairman Brandenstein, who called
the. men to order. , ,,
Braunhart said later that the Board
of Public Works had prepared 'its
requisition in better style than any
board that, has yet come .before the
committee and that only in the one
case 'Â¦' regarding the civil service mat
ter had he any cause to find fault.
The committee adjourned the meet
ing until Monday morning, when the
subject will again.- be taken up. â¢
Supervisor Braunhart strongly de
nounced Schmitz for employing the
men, and, > after considerable arguing
from both sides, he said:
"Of course, Mr. Schmitz, I know
that the violation of the charter Has
been purely accidental on your part,
and I know, sir, that you would not
engage for. a moment in any political
scheme â Oh, no!'
Schmitz said: "Well, never mind
about that. Wa all know what you'd
do; what you always have done, and
what you will do when given the
chance. I think it would be a good
plan if you would change the brand
of your cigars."
OFFICIALS QUARREL.
Michael Casey on being questioned
said that civil service had not always
proved a success and that in many
cases it has been little more than a
farce.. Â¦ . .-.; --cK-iA
/ It developed during the investiga
tion that three men were employed
on the Fourth and the Sixth street
bridges in the roles of assistant engi
neers, but that. their work consisted of
"bridge tending." There is no list of
assistant engineers on the civil ser
vice list and in this way the Board of
Works avoided employing civil ser
vice men.
Supervisor d'Ancona suggested that
if the entire Department of Public
Works should be consolidated into one
large office the expense might be de
creased, as one force of office em
ployes might then attend to all the
business of the department. The idea
was quickly /cast aside after a strenu
ous objection from Commissioner
Casey.
No further work was done in the
morning session and the committee
adjourned until afternoon. The after
noon session opened with a heated
argument upon the merits of the civil
service charter.
The first step taken yesterday morn
ing toward the investigation of the fig
ures was a close study of the payroll
of *the Board of Works. Supervisor
Brandenstein found that a resolution
of the Board of Supervisors to the ef
fect that the salaries of office employes
be reduced had been entirely ignored
and that in several cases the salaries
had been raised. . In one case the
salary, of a bookkeeper had been raised
from $1800 to $2100 per annum.
Schmitz averred Â¦ that he had at the
time of the change strongly opposed
it, but that his voice was overruled by
a large majority.
A recent raise of the salary of
Morris Levy, secretary of the Board
of- Public Works, caused considerable
comment from Brandenstein, who
said: "Personally I have nothing
against Mr. Levy, but time and again
I have seen him hanging around the
Supervisors' office during office hours
waiting for a permit to give a prize
fight."
WOULD CONSOLIDATE OFFICES.
Herbert Schmitz. president of the
Board of Works, maintains, however,
that there are many permanent im
provements that are sadly needed in
the city, but. that have been neglected
through lack*. of funds. He says that
$2,300,000 was asked for last year,
while only $769,867 was given the
board. '.-.;...- . -
The Board of Public Works/ repre
sented by Herbert Schmitz, Michael
Casey and Thomas P. Woodward, ap
peared before the Finance Committee
of the Board of Supervisors yesterday
morning to submit their money requi
sitions for the following fiscal year.
The total amount require'd by the
Board of Public Works this year is
$2,846,541 50, while the Auditor has
recommended that it be allowed but
$ # 924,122, an increase of $154,255 on
last year's budget.

Wonders will never cease even in San Francisco. It is
hardly credible that the president of the Board of Educa
tion has suggested an increase in the salaries of public
school teachers to a sum commensurate with the.impor
tance of the seryices'rendered to the community, but the
interesting, fact remains that the recommendation is of
record in the proceedings of* the Board of Supervisors.
If this wave of suggestion continues we may even come
to look upon pedagogy as skilled labor.

The best emeralds of modern times
have been taken from the mines about
eighty miles northwest of Bogota.
These mines were discovered in 1555
and were worked by the Spaniards in
1558. Until recently they were worked
under a Government 1 - concession to a
French syndicate.
The method of mining is crude and
has made little progress in the past
half dozen centuries. This is due
largely to the. fact that the natural
wealth of the various mines has not
made it advisable to introduce ex
pensive machinery.
A good emerald Is worth several
times as much as a diamond of the
same size. General George W. Mlndil,'
precious stones expert for the United
States at the port of New York, says
that fewer emeralds, have . come into
the country during the past year than
ever before, and that the importation
of them is diminishing yearly. Precious
stones merchants say that they are
unable now to obtain good emeralds,
and the price on them has advanced
more than 100 per cent in the past
three or four years.
London is the market, center, and the
tan-colored royalty of India, and the
Orient is the source of supply for
emeralds. .The goods purchased repre
sent the labor of months and often
times years In the* collecting "of them.
As there are none being mined, the
only way to get them is to send out
agents among the natives. But the na
tives are slow to surrender their
wealth, and if the agent, after weeks
of travel and living among them, re
turns.with 75 or 80 karats, he is doing
extremely well.â Boston Herald.

Galen Clark, custodian of the Yo
semlte Valley, the discoverer of the cel
ebrated Mariposa grove of big trees,
has taken up the cudgels in behalf of
the despised "Digger" Indians of Cali
fornia, and in a little book published
by himself, with the title of "Indians of
the Yosemite Valley and Vicinity," ap
pears as the unyielding champion of
much-wronged peoples. His work is
something more than an addition to
controversial literature, however, for
it embodies many facts of especial in
terest to the ethnologist and abounds
in suggestions to the prospective tour
ist. Mr. Clark's writes from an ac
quaintanceship of half .a century's
standing, having made his home in Yo
semite since he emigrated thither from
New York in 1853. Perhaps the most
interesting chapters of his book are
those giving details of the "Diggers' "
industries and paraphrases of their le
gends and myths. His "Hints to Yo
semite Visitors" contain some good
specimens of unconscious humor:
Men will find flannel or negligee
shirts the most comfortable.
Short skirts are most convenient.
Something absolutely soft for neck
wear will be found a great comfort,
both by men and women.
Smoked glasses will sometimes save
the wearer a headache.
Take a little more money than you
think will be needed. You may want
to prolong your stay.

ALL over the United States the public school teach
ers are the poorest paid of all^the servants of the
public. Indeed, the same thing is true about all
educators, and college and university professors are no
exception. We pay our other civil servants and the offi
cial grades -in the army. and navy much more liberally.
Yet it may be said with confidence that public school
teachers are the most useful and important of all who
serve the public for a salary. It is their work that
economizes all the other expenses of government. . If
it is well done there is less cause for spending money
on courts, almshouses, jails and penitentiaries.
The public school is where character is developed and
determined. There are laid the foundations of citizen
ship and there the lessons of patriotism are taught. The
schools prepare our citizens for the practical duties of
life. The schools are the nurseries of freedom, of civil
liberty, of the public welfare. When the teachers are
poorly paid, subjected to erratic and mutable political
control and disturbed in their poise of mind by financial
necessities due to poor compensation their work is im
pressed by these conditions and its defects are stamped
upon the future citizenship of those in their care.
It is a brutal view to take of their compensation and
work to say, as is often said, that they work onlyjfive
days in the week. We affirm that in those five days they
do more work, more important and more exhausting,
than any other'public servants do in ten days. Yet their
pay is the poorest of all. At the present scale of wages
a hodcaYrier in San Francisco, makes more than the
principal of one. of our schools. A stable hostler makes
more than the average teacher in the grades. Yet the
teacher has expenses for dress and living that are not re
quired of the hodcarrier and hostler.
.'In another view of it the high wages paid in the vari
\ous productive callings work out in the cost of living.
The teachers' incomes remain stationary while the cost
of living increases. Their incomes are fixed incomes
and. inelastic. They are fixed, too, not by any scale of
living at all. ...They do not expand as the .necessaries of
life rise in price, nor contract as they fall. They now
represent a wage adjusted to the minimum cost of living
under conditions long obsoleted. The average margin of
savings; possible for teachers has become very narrow,
and, we have reasons fot believing, has disappeared en
tirely in a large number of cases.
Â¦' A movement has been. started to increase the compen
sation bleachers in this State. It .should have general
encouragement. We can better afford to reduce other
salaries than we. can afford to keep teachers' pay at its
present level.

About four weeks afterward Mc-
Gregor came to Gaffey and. holding
out $5 said, "You win. Gaffey; the
eggs didn't hatch;* but now, old man,
I wish you'd tell me how you knew
they wouldn't."
"Well, Mac, if you want to know
I'll tell you. While you were asleep
that night I boiled the eggs at the
same time with my coffee."
"Oh, I'm Just taking a setting of
thoroughbred e&srs to a friend of mine
down south," answered his partner.
Gaffey took one of the eggs out of
the box,and held it up to theiight. He
shook his head and, In answer to an
inquiry as to what was wrong, said:
"Those egr^s will never hatch, Mac."
"Won't hatch! I'll bet you $5, the
price of the setting, they will," said
McGregor.
"All right; I'll take you," answered
Gaffey.
Nothing more was said and soon
afterward McGregor turned in for the
first watch off.
Several years ago, before the "Owl"
train was run between Oakland and
Los Angeles, Thomas Gaffey and W.
C. McGregor, two of the oldest rail
way postal clerks in the service, were
together on the night run through
the valley. As was then the custom,
the watches were "split." After the
train was fairly on its way one man
would stand' watch while the other
slept, and it was incidentally through
this /fact that McGregor became the
victim of a Joke at the hands of Gaf
fey, which has not yet been forgotten
among the employes of the postal de
partment.
Just before going out on one of the
runs McGregor had secured a setting
of thoroughbred eggs to take to a
friend in" Los Angeles. He took them
to the car, carefully packed In saw
dust. Soon after leaving Oakland
Gaffey's attention was drawn to the
box, which was set aside in the car.
"What have you got there, Mac?"
asked Gaffey.

Judge, "is thul anybody should keep

Xlre. Frasier, innocently.

The story of the Idyl which termina
trd so unfortunately Is almost as fun
ny ae the means which Mrs. Frasier
has taken recently to make still more
money out of it. To begin with, it was
in the unsympathetic guise of rent coir
lfctor that James Outrldge Splndelow
first entered Mrs. Frasier's shop andâ
to use his own expression â began buz
zing: around the "Jam pot." As a mere
ordinary, everyday rent collector Mr.
Ppindelow would have received any
thing but a warm welcome from the
widow. But as he speedily disclosed to
her he was an individual of much
greater importance. He is, in fact, a
species of parochial "Pooh Bah." In j
his own person he united the func
tions of parish constable, sexton, ver
ier, vestry messenger, sub-inspector of
nuisance. Coroner's officer, licensing
clerk asd clerk to an important firm
cf solicitors. Probably, however, what
more than this dazzling array of of
fices inclined Mrs. Frazier to encourage*
his "buzzing" was his statement that j
his income from these various sources
amounted to considerably over $5000 a
year.
Fpindelow acknowledged that there
existed an. impediment to speedy mar
riage in the shape of a wife. Mrs.
Frasier says he told her that he could
get rid of his wife by means of a di
vorce, but intimated that such a course
might give offense to the church peo
ple and especially the vicar on whose
Eood graces he was dependent for some
of his numerous offices. Besides, hia>
wife was sickly and likely to be re
moved by some dispensation almost
any time. The widow concluded that
15000 a year was worth waiting for. As
a p'edpe of good faith, to be redeemed
when nature had removed the legal ob
stftc'.e, Spindeiow went through a form
of mock marriage 'with her and drew
up this extraordinary document: -~*j.\
â¢"L James Outridge Splndelow, do
take cath that I love you, Georglna
and no other, that I love you sincerely
end devotedly and no other, and that 1
thill be kind and loving to you always,
sharing with you your Joys and sor
rows, and shall keep to you and you
only as long a* we both shall live."
This waÂ« in 1S9S. Mrs. Spindelow did
not die until three years later, and
thÂ«n the fly that had so pertinaciously
uuzzed around the "jam pot" ail this
time began to fight shy of it. Finally.
Kays Mrs. Frasier. be tola her that she
r.:ipht shoot him if she liked, but never
would he marry her.
But a widow over 40 never seeks so
lace In gore for blighted affections
when the man in the case is worth
(5000 a. year and the inevitable breach
of promise *uit followed, after Mr.
Splndelow had married somebody else,
perhaps it was the belief that Henry
Fielding Dickens, as the 6on of the
great novelist, must be possessed of
prt-at hereditary talent for- exposing
the ways and wiles of artful widows,
which induced Mr. Spindelow to place
his difecse in the har.ds of that clever
Kick's counsel. It availed him nothing,
hownver. The widow was good-look
ins and the Jury Impressionable. And
with an eye seemingly to possible fu
ture contingencies she had faithfully
preserved til bis letters.
"I want to bo your silly little baby
and* spoiled darling." cried out the
love-lorn Splndelow in one missive. In
another he sent Mrsr Frasier, "40,000.000
kisses."

tcr suspend, till peace is restored, the
expulsion from their actual places of
residence of those Jews whom the local
authorities have reported as living il
legally in localities where they were
formerly authorized to settle."â London
Times.
An official circular recently issued in j
Russia manifests a more lenient dis
position toward the Jews. It is a "Con
fidential Circular" Issued from the Min
istry of the Interior, Department of
the Police, Sixth Section, on March 19.
1904, and numbered 723. The circular
is addressed to the Governors of prov
inces and towns, and the chiefs of po
lice, and says:
"The measures that have been taken
at diverse epochs by the Minister of
the Interior for the purpose of expell
ing Jews from the localities which they
Inhabited, and which are outside the
zone established for their residence,
caused different local authorities to
adopt various dispositions that were
more or less rigorous. Their object was
to bring the Jews once "-more within
this zone. The very numerous corn
points sent by these expelled Jews
to the Ministry, and also the informa
tion Bupplied in regard to this matter
by the local authorities, all went to
show that the measures taken by the
Governors and the authorities under
them to enforce the laws confining,. the
Jews within their residential districts
sometimes entailed painful conse
quences to individuals. But it is evi
dent that, in certain cases, it is neces
sary to endeavor to discover the cause
which led these Jews to live where
they had no legal right of residence.
The law on this head is so. far recog
nized as defective by the superior au
jthorlties that preparatory studies have
been made with a view to revising the
restrictive laws to * which the Jewish
population of the Empire is subjected.
The lack of precision in these enact
ments gives rise to most 1 varied inter
pretations and this occurs even in the
superior institutions of the State. It
was, therefore, inevitable that the
measures taken in virtue of these laws
by the superior authorities, and more
especially those taken by the inferior
authorities, Bhould be lacking in that
regularity and uniformity necessary to
produce a favorable effect.
"In these circumstances it would
seem scarcely in harmony with the
principles of Justice to throw on the
Jews all the responsibility for the con
sequences resulting from their illegal
residence- outside the zone where they
Bhould be confined. This Is especially
the case at the present time, when the
unhappy situation' -of the expelled
Jews" is aggravated by ' the military
events occurring in the Far East â
events which have rendered mobiliza
tion necessary in certain military dis
tricts and the calling up for active ser
vice of the reservists, among whom
there are also ' members of families
which have been expelled from their
homes. Â¦ 'â¢

By 1S96 the full effect was upon the country. The
people, the owners of the money invested in enterprise,
were in distress. Their income had ceased; their securi
ty was destroyed; their trustees, the banks, were insol
vent. Mr. Bryan proceeded to organize the resulting
discontent and make the Democratic party its exponent.
As good times have followed bad, work idleness, and in
dependence dependence, the causes of discontent have
decreased. Democratic expediency requires that they
shall increase. Therefore the whole strength of the De
mocracy is invested in the manufacture of discontent and
Â¦accusations against the money power are the means
A small part. of the party is trying to be conservative
and is reinforced by another element that wants to win.
These two influences support Judge Parker. The Sun
says that there must be a reason for the prejudice against
the Judge, "and it can only be found in the determina
tion not to have a man who will lie still under the pres
sure of a. privileged class. We are not prepared to be
lieve that'Judge Parker will do this, but it will take some
explicit declarations to get the people out of the idea
that he might do it." v^
"That is to say, that the party demands a candidate
who will repeat the experiments that caused the panic of
1S93, and will take Judge Parker only upon an explicit
declaration to that effect. 'It needs no seer to see that, if
Parker were nominated and elected the party will do
just as it did to Cleveland. He opposed destructive
measures and had much constructive statesmanship.* But
great as was his strength the party broke, from his lead
ership "and- turned its guns upon him and all who sup
ported him. . .T; -â¢
It should be understood that the lessons of the past
move the .thoughtful voters, who elect Presidents,, to
look past the candidate to the,party. The country ,h'ad
confidence in Mr. Cleveland; but when he attempted to
invest his party with that confidence it refuied it and
spurned him. The Sun- is not the only witness that
proves that the spirit of the party is .unchanged and it
deserves the confidence of the country as little now as
it did in j8o6.
SOME time ago we noted the. criticisms of, Hearst by
the Colusa Sun, the leading Democratic paper ot
the State, but predicted that the Sun would finally
shine 00 Hearst and would support him if nominated.
This prediction is verified by a recent editorial in the Sun,
in which'it'is admitted that Hearst's nomination would be
the death of the party, but there were reasons given for
his nomination, which were in the prejudice of the rank
and file against Judge Parker. .,- *. . ' â¢ *'. ?~ ". : â¢â¢
This prejudice is declared to have its. origin in the.in
stincts of the people against the , money .power. "Then*
follows an indictment, cf the money power, which is
charged with "the -crime of 1873" in demonetizing. silver
and giving control of the volume of. currency to the na
tional banks. "The policy of a protective tariff - is also
charged up to the same influence-and the Democracy is
declared to be for free trade, intending, however, to ap
proach it- gradually.-; The conclusion from the {editorial is j
that the Democracy should take a. strong position rfor I
silver and greenbacks against the national banks and for
ultimate free trade. Then follows the admission that:
"It would requife great statesmanship , to carry out this
policy without breaking down thebusiiiess of the coun-.
try. Any sudden change of any system is bad for the
financially weak." * . : :'I; : J -: : -
We accept this statement as a frank declaration from
an able source which represents the intentions ; of .'the
party,*that those intentions arc dangerous to the couri- !
try's interests and especially to those who are .financially
weak. That means the enterprise of the country, which
is always in the hands of those who borrow capital. 1
Every important railway system is a large borrower and
all of the great activities of the country are promoted bys
borrowers. Who are the lenders? AVhere does. the bor
rowed money come from and who are its owners?. It
comes out of the savings banks and financial trust com
panies and belongs to the people.- It is^mostly the sur
plus wages of labor, deposited with trustees in'ordcr to
secure interest as income. It builds railroads, factories,
ships and the great buildings in cities. It is the arterial,
blood that nurtures the country and symmetrically de
velops all of its resources.
It is the^money persistently referred to as "the money
power" by that class of- Democrats who have taken
counsel of socialism, and by advocating legislation inimi
cal to this money' power are the proponents. of the level-"
ing programme of the socialists. They mistakenly'"con
sider the visible properties and activities created by the
people's money/ as the money power, when "it is all. the
creature of that power which is merely the surplus gains
â¢of labor. Acting upon that error it is proposed to destroy
Ihe power of the creature to pay interest to the creator.
When this occurs the people who own the money not"
only lose their income from it, but' their security is-im-'
paired and their capital is lost to the extent of that im
pairment.
The Democratic position seems not to have changed'
since Mr. Bryan dictated it in 1896. For three years
prior to that date the country had been in the grim grip
of a panic, the worst ever suffered by any country. It
certainly had one cause, established by Democratic tes
timony, and that was the Democratic tinkering with- sil
ver.* Mr: Cleveland has clearly stated this in his recent
article on the bond issues. From the Republican side an
other reason appears in the assault upon the protective
system. It is evident, therefore, that just what is now
stated to be Democratic policy was the cause of that
panic, and the Sun admits that the same cause will pro
duce the same effects again, but insists that it shall be
tried gradually.

It needs not the correspondent's further description of
how two Finnish regiments at Viborg and Sveaborg had
to be deprived of their, arms and marched to the .train
for Manchuria at the point of the bayonet to assure the
world of what has^lready been guessed, while the stories
of the scores and even hundreds of young Russians who
have fled'the country to escape the military draft' do but
add confirmation to the opinion already formed concern
ing^the morale of the Russian -arnjy. and the* sentiments
of the people from which that army is drafted.. Before
the present-war broke forth The Call showed, both edi
torially, and through l^s press dispatches;, the alarming
rate at which disaffection had been growing, in the Rus
sian army, both through the spread of radicalism and as
a ' result of "the oppressive measures' pursued by
the Government itself in Finland and elsewhere. That
the bitter bread. cast. upon the. waters has returned to the
Czar is. due to. nothing but the : workings' of the inevitable.
Scarcely a difficult thing is it to figure before the mind
the state; of sentiment that must exist in the hearts of
thousands who pay grudging allegiance to the Czar, when
now their blood and their treasure is being -requisitioned
relentlessly in order that the -double eagle may not fall
in tttter ignominy away off somewhere on the other side
of Asia. In Russian Poland, for instance, or in the more
lately "assimilated" Finland, where in.. both iristr#es
every effort has been made to stamp out the last vestiges
of ' a national entity," evert- to the "interdiction of the na
tional tongue, can it be imagined that the ".Czar's mis
fortunes are to be regarded in anything but the light of
a present opportunity for fanning into flame the latent
spirit of revolt. cannot .look for undivided
patriotic support to the peoples, who have been subjected
to his bitter tyranny. ' ..'.,. . .
Anything in the" nature of a revolt on the part of any
one of the Czar's subject. nations cannot be a probability
yet awhile! The fear of that blind force that has crushed
thousands in the prisons of Siberia still holds and will
hold unless greater disaster comes to Russian arms than
has yet been scored. But this truth is manifest: that the
strength of the great empire of the north, which has so
long been a matter of awe and fear in the eyes of the
nations, has been so suddenly, unmasked and the cankers
in the system so thoroughly revealed that the world may
see the plight of the Muscovite and cease to fear him.

floral products. The exhibition will

appearance of a beautiful garden. The
stands against the walls are heaped
with the rarest of flowers and the
decorative plants, such as ferns and

country gardens find a place and -the
collection of wild flowers can scarcely
be excelled. The exhibits are in four

One hundred and eighteen boys and
girls marched in procession up the aisle
of St. Francis Church yesterday morn
ing: at 7:20 o'clock and received at the
altar rails their first communion.
The Rev. Father Terrence Caraher
was celebrant of the mass and the Rev.
Father William E. McGough directed
the children throughout the ceremony.
A number of the Sisters of the Holy
Family, who have been instructing the
children for some months, were pres
ents-
Each boy wore on his right arm a
white silk bow and the girls were at
tired in pretty white frocks and wore
long, flowing white veils.
The high and Â«ide altars were beauti
fully decorated with the choicest flow
ers cf the season and were, besides,
ablaze with lights.
Father McGough read during mass a
number of prayers alternated by hymns
rendered by the choir.
The address was delivered by the
Rev. Father Caraher, who said in part:
My dear children, you this day should feel
greatly honored on account cf the truest you
are to receive. If you were to be visited by
eoroe kins. Â«aaperor or prince, cr by the Presi
dent of the United States, you would feel hfpli
i It honored and the Joy would be exceeding great.
j But you are to receive now a visit not frcm
any earthly ruler, but from the King cf Kings
and Lord of Lords, and therefore your Joy
should knew no bounds.
Ore of the objects of the institution of .the
Blessed Eucharist by cur Lord was to unite
: ue to himself and to nourish us with hit body
and blood. Now. when you will receive holy
communion yon will be united most closely
and Intimately with Tour Savior.
When on earth Christ said to him followers
"I an the vine, you the branches." therefore
our union with him Is like that of the branches
with the vine.
On this bright May morning of your first
communion and the Feast of the Ascension
of our Lord, you should resolve to avoid mor
tal ein. to shun bad company, which corrupts,
and hear rr.aps Sundays and holy days and re
ceive the sacraments of penace and Holy Eu
charirt. frequently ; then you will be leading
holy lives pleasing to your Lord and after
deatb you will be happy with God and his
saints and angels.
Following are -the names of those
who received their first holy commun
ion:
Boys â Ellwood Brown, Philip McCormack,
Harry Williams. Edward McDevitt. Charles
Down*. Ernest Ctuua. Eugene Aavannl. Jo

on Joe Marshall to the Boise City club.

appointed him.
Captain Pete Lohman of the Oak-"
lands fears that Dunleavy's playing
days are numbered. The fast / out
fielder is suffering from water on the
knee and a bad sprain of the knee
cap. Pitcher Buchanan was hit on
the nose with a batted ball while prac
ticing yesterday and may also be laid
up, for some time.
. Pitcher Oscar Graham is one of the
most dangerous hitters in this or. any
other league. His thrilling home run
on Wednesday is but a reminder of the
many games he broke up 1 last season
with timely, hits. On one occasion,
when his two-bagger in the ninth beat
Los Angeles, he was showered with
gold and silver by admiring fans.
The .members of the Olympic'; Club
will : tramp across country next Sun
day. There will be two divisions, one
for the fast walkers and Another for
those who prefer a" slower , pace. It
will be in the nature of a blind run;
the route not . being: given out, - but 'â¢ it
is safe to say the start will be made
from Ross Valley. -Â« â¢ ';

NOTES OF THE GAME.
T. Streib's clever throw caught Chase trying
to stretch a single into a double In the ninth.
Newton forgot to use bis high ball and kept
'cm low all the time. Oakland likes the low
boye .
Buchanan seemed due for a beating every
inning, yet he was ever steady and kept out
of bad hol?Â«. He walked no one and. kept the
ball over all the time. Â¦ -,
Louis Jeuness. owner of. a couple of horses
which won oncei tried the umpire's Job yes
terday. He was right there all the time and
worked well. He deserves another try.
Young Streib proved a sensation. He was In
the game all the time and never overlooked a
trick. He made two runs and as many hit.*,
and in the field he behaved like a .veteran.
Pete .will probably give the youngster a fair
trial and he and Julie will then have a chance
to do the brotherly act every once In awhile.
An unusual play was made In the -third,
when Bernard dropped Devereaux's fly. Kru
ger was on first and started for second. Ber
nard threw the ball to Flood, whp dropped It.
Kruger made the base, but slid over it. H?
came near getting back again, but was caught
be'tween the lines.
A little dummy work on the bases and great
throws by Ganley and J. Streib let the Angela
down without a run in the second round. Ber
nard hit it out safely Â«and Cravath followed
with a drive to the rlghtfleld fence. Bernard
got as far as third. Ganley*s throw to thlri
wan perfect. Cravath in the -meantime was
several feet off first base. Francks threw to
Streib and the latter made a great one-handed
stop. Bernard tried to get home on the play,
but Streib recovered himself and made a per
fect throw to the plate, cutting oft the run.
Otts Will Try Out Kubr Smith.
Rube Smith has been winning his
spurs at San Rafael this week by box
ing all comers, irrespective of size, and
beating them at all points. He has
had visitors of the middle-weight divi
sion and exponents of even greater
bulk, but the Colorado fighter has
played no fa^ cites. He is a deceptive
man in build, looking like a 130
pounder, while - tipping the beam at
fully twelve pounds less, but no mat
ter how big his opponent, he asks no
odds. Smith might be termed a mys
tery locally, as he has won his con
tests so easily that no one can class
htm where he really belongs. Billy Otts
will show how good a fighter Smith is
at the Reliance Club next Monday
night, when they furnish the main
event of fifteen rounds at 142 pounds.
Otts weighed less than 140 pounds
yesterday when he came in from the
road. He will build up from now on.

IX TILE PUBLIC COURTS
BATTLING NELSON. WHO 13
~ MATCHED TO FIGHT MARTIN
CANOLE AT WOODWARDS.
Martin Canole, the clever Boston
lightweight, and Battling Nelson of
Salt Lake are training carefully for
their meeting one week from to-night
in Woodward's Pavilion. The former
is at Croll's "Gardens, Alameda, and
the latter at Sheehan's Beach Tavern.
Canole, who made such a wonder
ful fight* with Jimmy Britt at Colma.
Is said to have the best left hand of
any boxer since Jack Dempsey was in
his prime. .
Nelson Is 'more of a fighter than a
boxer- and. from his rugged build and
determined appearance it is evident
he can both assimilate and deliver a
lot of punishment. The styles of the
rival lightweights are so different that
a lively fight is sure to result from
their meeting. It -Is expected either
Jack Welch or Billy Roche will ref
eree the contest, which is being pro
moted by the San Francisco Athletic
Club.
\ The big Doc got his yesterday at Rec
; reation Park. He manged to sail safely
along o'er the stormy seas of many
innings and many games for the past
few weeks, but yesterday it was-cur
tains. The Oaks had a bunch of clubs,
each of which contained one or more
good, honest base hits and of course
the Doc was the fall guy when they
i began to land. Score, Oakland 5, Los
Angeles 1. , \,' # -.->;.;
Oakland let the big' fellow alone for
the first inning, but in the second the
music began to play. With two gone,
Julie Streib swatted for a swei-sacker
to center. Then along v came his kid
brother just from the bushes. He was
nicely received by the fans and every
one wished him well. but. when, the
youngster tore off a hot liner to left
and scored brother Julie, the fans were
ready tobuild him a monument.
The Angels got the run back in the
third, the only tally they cbuld nego
tiate. The big Doc responded with a
double to the score board. Raymond
laid down a bunt and- Flood produced
a single over f second that made the tal
ly possible. -
Newton's real woe did not show till
the next two. spasms. Ganley, partook
of a pass in the third and Buck
Francks pushed out one of his- ancient
doubles to center that scored Bobby.
Then Kruger hit to short and Francks
went as far as third. Devereaux pop
ped a high one to Bernard, who: pro
ceeded to drop the fly and let the run
in. He recovered the ball and' Kruger
was finally caught as he- was trying
to get to- third.
In the next "two rounds they kept af
ter the big fellow and gave him the
wallop regularly. In the meantime,
Buchanan was being hit hard, but not
safely. The Angels got to him- nine
times. In several innings base hits
would have proved to be runs, yet the
Southerners could never come through
when a run was nejeded.
Streib's brother was the great kid
of the game. Besides hitting it out
safely twice, he made a fine catch of
New.ton's fly to short left in the fifth
and during the mixup in the same
round, he cut third base and came in
on a short single without the umpire
seeing him. Wheeler pitched the last
two innings and allowed/ no .hits or
runs. The score:

George Murray, erstwhile Olympic
Club welterweight, gained a decision
over "William Stuart, the deep sea box
er, last night at the Mechanics* Pavil

the fight, but It carried no glory with
it, for the alleged victor was all but
gone when the bout came to an end,
while the sailor lad was fighting his
best and landing rights and lefts at
will.. ; *i'-'''~$,
Murray had the better of the first
round, but in the next two little fight
ing was dene. Murray did not like to
mix with the brawny mariner and kept
away, Jabbing at long range. Stuart
made a hurricane finish. He started
in during the fourth to rush his man
all over the ring. Murray was ready
to quit, for he was getting a severe
beating. The judges disagreed, po
Milton Hayes brought down the wrath
of the house on himself by deciding
In favor of Murray.
The next best bout on the card was
the mixup between Al Elkins and Abo
Label. Label knocked his man out as
they were going into a clinch In the
last round. He got him with a right
swing squarely on the jaw. Elkins
went down and was out for ten min
utes. Â¦"â¢-*"
It was a hurricane fight from the tap
of the bell. Both boys were out for
vengeance, but Label proved the clever
er and the harder hitter of the two.
Many times he shook up his husky op
ponent with right and left to the head
and body, while Elkins found it hard to
land an effective punch.
The rest of the card was at an or
dinary character. James Linegar fin
ished Harry Brown in three rounds.
Ivan Askins succumbed to the blows
of Kid Vedo in two rounds. Jack Brow n
secured the decision over "Walter Need

The petition of Mrs. La Grande for
distribution to her of half the estate
of her father, Leon P. .Pinchon, creat
ed quite a sensation In Judge Kerri
gan's court yesterday. The petition
for distribution contained the request
that $750 of the J1600 coming to, Mrs.
La Grande be distributed to H. S.
Bridge, who at the request of Mur
phy only a month ago advanced $400
to the petitioner. â¢ The loan was made
to Mrs. La Grande to enable her to
get married, and she gave Murphy a
note for the amount and an assign
ment of her interest in the estate as
security. For the use of 5400. for one
month she would have had to pay
$350 but for the fact that her attor
ney learned that of , the $350 the sum
of $200 was to go to Murphy for his
services in negotiating the loan, and
took steps to prevent Judge Kerrigan
from affixing his signature to the de
cree of distribution.
Judge Kerrigan took the matter un
der advisement, but before doing so
expressed himself rather forcibly on
the methods of money lenders. He
said: "I think it is about time that
something should be done to prevent
people from taking advantage of the
necessities and inexperience of per
sons -who happen to -be, in the need of
a little ready money."

I am greatly annoyed by all the publicity
which has been given to this affair. I am a
eoldler and have been for thirty-two years.
For the last ten days I have been so harassed
by this affair that I can hardly do Justice to
my work here, and I have plenty of wo fit to
do In this camp.' I can assure you. I was en
gaged to Miss Harold after the very ehort
courtship of ten days. I found soon after the
engagement that neither of us could be happy
when married, and I deemed It my honorable
duty as an officer and a gentleman to so In
form the lady. A matrimonial alliance be
tween us would, have been positively devoid of
any happiness. The matter has been all stirred
up In Washington by people who I presumo
think they are doing a friendship to MiiÂ« Har
old. They are certainly doing an unwise thing,
to bring the lady's name before the world at
large. I am a friend of Secretary Taft, and I
do not think for a moment that he believes that
I am painted in true colors in these charges.
The next time I see a petticoat coming any
where near me I shall feel like running and
jumping Into the bay.
Colonel Pitcher does not deny that
for a short period he was engaged to
Miss Caroline Harold; he does deny
that he ever jilted her. Colonel Pitcher
said yesterday:
AXXOYED BY PUBLICITY."
I do not wish to make a direct charge
against Colonel Pitcher In regard to his having
Jilted ill* s Caroline Harold, because It would
bring the lady's name into too much public
prominence, but I wish to show the authorities
at Washington what sort of a man Colonel
Pitcher is. I simply want to brlcg to the no
tice of the heads of the Military Department
this afTalr of the colonel's with Miss Harold.
I think the Government should, be Informed
as to the doings of Its servants. ' >j', ~ ? Â¦â¢Â¦;;

In view I* proposed to him that Instead, of
mcvlng I would for the present remain and
rent from him my present offices, engage my
owi. clerk and proceeÂ«l to build up my. own
business, only using his clerks for his work,
which I would continue to supervise and at

quirements were to grow less and that I would
continue to reduce It from time to t-ime as . his
business Uecieased. â¢ â¢ â¢ The Inspectors
hav e Jeft and again the conditions have
changed, for they went away with nothing
that can help the Government and very much
disgusted with the results of their, investiga
tions. The bill in Oregon failed, but fortu
nntely no one learned who was behind It. so
no scandal will result therefrom, as I had
feared. I must withdraw the advise to let
tho business alon* so lar aa the standpoint
of safety is concerned, and barring any other
reasons, therefore, you can. ; I think, feel, at
liberty to take .any business that may be sent
on. It Is this situation that Justifies my de
laying my move so as to make the most ad
vantageous arrangement possible.
Dimond testified that he had received 11000
from Browne In Washington and hence did
not press Hyde ."or money between March 1,
when he claims to have left his service, and
December 22, when he called htÂ» former client
to his office and "boned" him for cash. . The
letter*, however, show that he received only
$400 from Browne early in the year, and that
he never *ot $1000 from him.
Dimond said that, because of Hyde's irregu
larities, he had made up his mind before
March 1 to leave htm. and that his demand of
$5C0 a month was made because he knew Hyde
would refuse . It. and thus eive him a good
excuse for getting- out. I asked him whether
he had not offered to remain at a lower, sal
ary when Hyde's clerk. Miss Farwell, died
and he denied it. The letter* contain his ad
missions to Urowne, that he used every en
deavor to remain In . Hyde's service, even
offering to accept a descending scale of
palary -
He denied that he used the fact of Benson's
arrest to hold up Hyde, and that he had never
threatened to take a fee from the Government
for prosecuting his former client. The tetters
enow Just thÂ« contrary.
The letters read by Heney were in
part as follows:
"For what purpose a these letters
offered?" demanded night. â¢
"To show that Dimond's testimony
Mas false," answered the Government
lawyer, and. forth with he furnished the
following bilh-tDf particulars:
The production of these letters by
Heney Is one of the surprises of the
case, but its explanation, is simple.
Throughout Dimond's testimony Browne
has been quoted constantly In justifica
tion of the acts" of the witness: It was
on Browne's suggestion, Dimond said,
that he had written Hyde the letter of
January 22, 1903, telling his client that
he had made money so fast and grown
so careless that he was in danger of
criminal prosecution for offering the
Government California and Oregon
school lands obtained by the use of
fictitious names and other Irregular,
methods. It was Browne's advice, he
added, that led to his .break with Hyde,
after the latter had failed to prove his
school land titles Tood by Â¦ means
Browne and Dimond had dictated. Thus
Dimond and his counsel have constant
ly argued to Commissioner Heacock
that Dimond was no more culpable than
Browne.
"If that is so," said Heney ten days
ago, "Mr. Browne will hear from us."'
Â§ The publication' of this â¢ remark
brought a vigorous protest in the shape
of a telegram from Browne in self-de
fense. He objected to â¢ being used as
a stalkln^ horse. In due time Judge
Pugh, the Interior Department attor
ney, who is aiding Heney i.i the case,
received a bulky package J containing
all the letters that passed between Di
mond and Browne.
The letters were not read into the
record without vehement protests from
Dimond and his attorney, Samuel
Knight. Their surrendi â¢ to the Gov
ernment was denounced as a breach of
friendship. â¢
WHAT THE LETTERS SHOW.
Francis J. Heney, special "counsel for
the Government in the land frauds
case, yesterday threw a bomb into the
camp of the defense by producing a
mass of correspondence 'between Henry
P. Dimond and his friend A. B. Browne
of the Washington law firm of Brltton
& Gray, tending to. contradict Dlmond's
testimony as to his relations with his
codefendant and former client, Fred
A. Hyde.
Browne's firm had acted ae Hyde's
counsel in many cases before the Gen
eral Land Office' at' the capital, and on
going to Washington in the summer
of 1901 Dimond was instructed by his
client to obtain and follow their ad
vice in prosecuting the Hyde-Benson
lieu land selections. - This arrangement
led" to an intimacy between Dimond and
Browne, and finally to a series of .let
ters after Dimond's return to San
Francisco. These faithfully reported
all the attempts to extract additional
compensation from the unwilling Hyde.
Browne was told of the anonymous
letters which Dimond says he re
ceived. Browne was i informed that
these letters had been shown to Hyde,
and he was also consulted as to the
possibility of Dimond's receiving a
Government retainer to join, in .the
prosecution of the land frauds, con
cerning v.hich he reminded Browne
that he was fully posted.
BROWXE REPUDIATES DIMOXD.
supply of his official paper and Hyde
had drafted the reports, at the same
time - preparing the maps that went
with them to Washington. Allen said
that he provided some of the data for
these reports and Hyde the balance.
The school sections, 16 and 36, were
always included in the areas recom
mended for withdrawal. Hyde and
Benson operated in school lands.
"It was a general opinion among thÂ«
land agents,": said Allen naively,
"that it was a good thing to be on
friendly terms with Hyde."
Knight, asked for a writ of attach
ment to compel the attendance at Mr*.-
Belle A. Curtis, whom he charged with
evading the service of a summon*
since his attempts to connect her with
the authorship of the, anonymous let
ters. The, commissioner refused to 1Â«
sue the writ, but Marshal Shine will
make every effort to have the lady In
court this morning. Â¦
Judge Cabanlss' courtroom was
crowded with striking stablemen and
their sympathizers while the charge of
carrying dangerous weapons against
Thomas White. Joseph Egan and Rob
ert Hayes was being heard. The de
fendants were arrested on complaint of
a non-union hostler, who alleged In
timidation, n Hayes' possession was
found a "knuckle duster," while White
had an iron wrench in one of his pock
ets. The case against White was con
tinued till to-day, Egan was dis
charged and Hayes must show cause
why he was equipped with the "knuckle
duster."
"At any rate." said his Honor, "the
claim of marriage would not make
your reckless pistol practice less rep
rehensible, for husband-shooting" Is
specifically prohibited by the statutes.
And evÂ»n irit were not so. the hand
ling of a pistol by a woman must al
ways be regarded as a menace to pub
lic safety."
Ella Beatlle. who discharged a re
volver indiscriminately from the win
dow of her boudoir at Mason and Ellis
streets last Saturday night, pleaded
neglect by a man to whom she bore
hymeneal relationship, but her inabil
ity to prove wifehood resulted in Judge
Mogan pronouncing her guilty of dis
turbing the peace and postponed sen
tence' till to-day.
Jane Ba*llnger, who has spent about
eleven and a half of, the past twelve
years in Jail for vagrancy, was give.i
three months more yesterday by Judge
Mogtm, before whom it was proved
that she had been helplessly drunk in
front of a public Fchoolhou.se at Fourth
and Clara streets.
This woman is the most pitiable spec
imen of her sex in San Francisco.
From respected' wifehood she has,
within a dozen years, fallen to the very
lowest depths of degradation, and it
is a matter of a very brief time until
death from alternating dissipation and
imprisonment will relieve the commu
nity of her presence. There are many
homes in the city in which she was
once a welcome visitor, but her hope
less depravity has outworn the char
ity of the most patient Of those who
were her friends.
Mrs. Bingham, who is held for vag
rancy, shows evident reluctance to
prosecute the fellow who vowed to
cherish her. but the Society for. the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children had
taken un the case and will press the
charge that Is likely to result in Bing
ham's incarceration for a long term.
Not long ago Judge Mogan disposed of
a somewhat similar case by sentencing
the defendant to terms of imprison
ment aggregating eighteen months.
Bingham's trial is set for to-day.
It was a sickening story of masculine
depravity that Judge Mogan heard
while issuing a warrant for the arrest
of Abe Bingham on the felony charge
of permitting his wife to be an inmate
of a disorderly house. The woman,
who is known- also as' Pearl Crossley.
reluctantly told how Bingham had
forced her to lead an immoral life to
support him and their two children,
and -of how he -had thus been main
tained for years, although he is sound
of mind and body. He made all the
arrangeme'nts for her sojourns in sev
eral bagnios and has kept the two
children, little girls, where they could
not avoid cognizance of their mother's
shame.
. James Leahy was In Jocular mood
when he boarded an Ellis-street "owl"
early yesterday morning, and after he
had vainly endeavored to find a
kindred spirit among the other pas
sengers he espied the conductor's
lunch basket and resolved to have
some fun with it. So he raised the
lid and extracted the^ edibles, fa
cetiously commenting on their quality
and holding them up for inspection
until their owner entered from the
rear platform and angrily denounced
his conduct. Mr. Leahy tried to con
vey to the indignant transfer puncher
a share of the sense of humor that
possessed himself, but without success,
and theri he, too. became angered and
indulged in language and actions that
provoked arrest.
"And yet." said Judge Fritz, survey
ing the* rather sober^ visage of Mr.
Leahy, "the laugh-loving public is
yearning for fun and the theater man
agers are pleading inability to pro
duce it, while you, s=ir, are wasting im
promptu comedy upon the sleepy in
mates of 'owl' cars. The stage is hun
gering for you, Mr. Leahy, and after
you have paid a fine of $5 you will be
at perfect liberty to drive away dull
care at a fabulous salary per/*^-
But the woman's face did not sub
stantiate Mr. Griffin's airy plea. Both
eyes were discolored and swollen and
her nether lip bore a fresh scar. Mr.
Griffin smiled serenely as he glanced
at his handiwork, but the smirk sud
denly faded- when Judge Mog^n held
him in $500 bail to "reappear to-day
and instructed the officer to bring
more testimony.
So spoke M. Griffin, -who- keeps a
saloon on Taylor street, between Turk
and Eddy, when asked to say some
thing in response to a patrolman's
v-'harge that he had battered the coun
tenance of Mabel Edwards, his con
sort. .
"Xothin* to it â little tiff â merely
shoved her faceâ didn't hurt her a
bit."
although she was not licensed to sell
spirituous liquors. It was not so much
rÂ«? POÂ»ceman's charge, as the un
,v i 1 ? le ligilt in -which its publicity
would place her before her neighbors,
that piqued Miss Wilson, she said,
inaeed, she considered the officer's
charge too silly for anything.
let, according to . the. officer's tes
timony, It was those same neighbors
"If, 1 first called his attention" to Miss
Wilson and informed him that she
was violating the municipal revenue
jaws. Acting upon this information,
ne donned plain apparel and called
Â°" the lady and she fairly flew to pro
vide iiim with and Â¦ accept payment
for the w-hisky he ordered.
Miss Wilson was too deeply shocked
by the officer's disclosure to prepare
a defense instanter and Judge Mogan
gave her till May 19 to recover
equanimity and prove character.

brother and herself and to keep house
fo? the family at 1403 Montgomery
etrtej. The neglectful parent spent all
'fcis earnings for drink and did not hesi
tate i.0 eat the bread provided by the
riard'toil of his first-born.
., After he had heard the girl's story
aÂ«u the defendant's miserable excuse
and apepal for mercy. Judge Mogan
"precsrilÂ»ed a sentence of three months
; William Mulcahey despairingly con
"fes'sed failure of the memory test to
which he had been suggested by Judge
Jlogan. He was arrested last Sunday
afternoon at Kearny street and B.road
â¢ x\|ay â¢ for drunkenness, and when he
seated in court on Monday that he
cculd not tell how he got there, as
r&eo^ecticn left him on Sunday morn
ing* at the foot o* Third street, the
Judge continued the case from day to
; to see if the defendant's recreant
memory could not be persuaded to fill
.th* void By hard straining Mr. Mul
cahÂ£y gradually remembered his north
â¢ ward rsrctfrreFS until he arrived at Cali
fornia and Kfarny streets, but past
â¢tha.t_ point his mind could not convey
him., although he lost much sleep In
â¢ mental wrestling.
"N'o use trying any more." said Mr.
sorrowfully, "for my brain
Is about played out."
â¢ "Jt's too bad." was the sympathetic
'response." "that a seven-block blank
must ever remain on your life. Better
go hack to the tanks and give your
JbVain a twenty-four-hours rest."

â¢As' he sat among the prisoners In

emlled in a silly way at every one

The conl bvge Mclroae with more than a
thousand tons of coal on board, sprung a leak
Wednesday night and sank yesterday morning
at Mission-street wharf. When the leak was
discovered an effort was made, to keep the
hull clear of water by the use of the pumps
on the barge. The Inflow was too great, how
ever, and two Sprcckels tugs were sent for,
They were -made . fast on each side of the
waterlogged barge and will hold her up until
diver Roach has patched up the leak, when
the tow boat pumps will make short work* of
clearing the Melrosc of water.

BRITISH BHIP ANGLESEY, WHICH
SAILED FOR ENGLAND AFTER
A LONG REST.
TO ARRIVK.
Movements of Steamers.
The Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company's liner Doric arrived in
port shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday
afternoon and landed her passengers
at the Pacific Mall wharf. She left.
Hongkong April 16. At Honolulu two
cabin and 295 Asiatic passengers were
landed, and seventy-seven cabin, ten
steerage, ninety- three Japanese, one
Turkish, one Tahitlan and 150 Chinese
passengerg arrived here on the liner. .
The Doric brought an unusually val
uable cargo, including seventy-five
treasure . boxes containing 4,550,000
Japanese gold yen, worth $2,259,000. Of
the 2954 tons of cargo there are 1202
bales of raw Bilk, varued at about
$650,000; also twenty-two packages of
assorted silks; 1385 boxes of tea, sixty
two bales of gunnies. 4931 bales of
matting and 5032 bales of hemp.
The Doric called - at Manila, prob
ably for the last time, owing to the
fact that American vessels only will
be permitted to carry on trade between
here and the Philippine Islands after
next July.
Excellent weather was experienced
during the entire voyage and a good
time was had by the voyagers. The
Bhlp was full to the point of refusing
passengers at every port.
On board was Earl 13. Shaw, son of
the Secretary of the Treasury, who
went'^to the Far East some time ago
on a Government mission. As soon
as the Doric dropped anchor Shaw
was taken aboard the Golden Gate and
hurried to the Oakland pier, where he
caught an overland train. Hon. C. A.
"Wlllard. Justice of the Philippine Su
preme Court, and Judge F. G. Walte,
a Manila Jurist, were also on board.
A. A. Williamson, civil engineer in the
Hrltish navy, lately on duty near
Hongkong, crossed on the Doric. H. F.
Merrill, commissioner of the imperial
Chinese customs, lately of Wuhu and
Nanking, was on board and will go
with his family to Boston. Edward L.
D. Boyle, engineer expert for the great
Armstrong works, England, who went
to the Orient with the new Japanese
cruiser Kasuga, is on his way home.
Other notables were Captain Fick of
the Siamese navy, Th. Wesel and J.
Polglase. merchants of Singapore and
'Bangkok, and several employes of the
Philippine civil service. The complete

Chamberlain spoke for an hour and
a half, devoting his speech almost ex
clusively to his proposed fiscal policy.
He repeated mont of his former ar
guments and appealed to the patriot
ism of the people for the preservation
of the emj/Jre.
After paying a tribute to the late
Joseph Hoivc-il Williams. Metr-ber of
ParliatnpRt for South Birmingham,
who died !ajÂ»t February, Chamberlain
plunged IntÂ«> hÂ£s fiscal policy. lie satd
the question coyJd not be disposed of
by waring oid rags or by the clatter
lr.R cf worn-out cans, but that It would
remain until It wjls no longer a ques
tion but a fact. The Unionist party,
he said. wtÂ« pledged to the policy of
retaliation ar.d already the fiscal agi
tation was having Its effect. He had
mÂ»-t men abroad who
h*d paid that if h!s policy was carried
out they would be obliged to remove
th^ir business to <Â»reat Britain.
Chamberlain ?aid there had been
Ie*:Â» "dumping" recently, but he could
not rest satisfied until the fiscal policy
became effective. He Raid he wisbfrd
he could have a referendum to-mor
row on thÂ» question, which he believed
would be favored by a large majority
of the pecpic. A general election would
rot come *oon. but it would come in a
reasonable time and might go against
the Ur.ionixtji. Perhaps, however, the
cause would not suffer if the scene
should be cHanged, Chamberlain said,
ar.d a new piece produced which would
6O*>n be hissed off the stage.

CHICAGO. May 12. â A firm undertone, due
to heavy rains and low temperature in the
Northwest, prevailed In wheat at the opening
to-day. Initial sales of July were unchanged
to a shade higher at 85%c to 85%@S5%c. A
report- that flre at Fort William had de
stroyed a large elevator full of wheat brought
out enough buying orders from pit traders to
advance the price to SOiic. Receipts were ex
tremely small, and this fact also exerted a
bullish Influence. But trading in <rener.il was
light. The market lacked any outside sup
port, and with a continuance of offerings the
price rradually weakened. A number of bear
ish reports were received during the day, in
creasing the weakness. Advices from Russia
stated -ihat the surplus of wheat for export
was : till laree and that the weather was
favorable for rrowln*- wheat. The condition
of wheat fields In the Southwest was reported
to have shown considerable improvement. An
Influential selling: motive was the lack of out
side demand, the supposition being that if
there Is no foreign demands between now and
harvest, time stocks of wheat In Chicago wlfi
show a big Increase. The market closed weak:
with July at 84*ig84%c after the price had
declined to 84%Â©84%c. â¢ â¢
Corn was moderately strong on light re
ceipts and on covering by shorts. July closed
Viifr'/ic higher at 4Â»c.
In symDathy with corn, oats ruled firm
the entire day. July closed unchanged.
Provisions were firm on strong hog markets
early, but later there was some oressure to
sell, and Drices settled to a little below. yeÂ»
terday^s final quotations.- Pork was down

The demand for small sizes of Navel
Oranges ' continued brisk and offerings of 176s,
which had the most call, were -â¢ held at a

to cut in order, to effect sales. Cherries wera
plentiful and lower despite a fair Inquiry for
shipment on the Portland steamer. Receipts
were 4S.5 boxes, a email portion of which were
shipped direct to Oakland. Well colored lots
sold from &5c to $1 25 i>er drawer, the latter
being an extreme fleure. white the small
white variety dragged at 50Â©75c. Arrivals of
Berries, were heavy, aggregating 915 cheats,
and as the receipts were too heavy for tin
market to readily absorb prices declined and
there were a great many chests of the largs
varieties, stfll unsold at the close. The top
quotations for both varieties were extreme and
obtained only for small lots of favored brands.

"The pa*t wef-k has been cool and fhow
Â«?ry. n-ijh several frosty mornings. It was
favorabie for advancing farm work, but too
.cool for rapid growth. Fail wheat and fall
barley are everywhere In excellent condition,
and b) some localities early town fall barley
Is beginning to head. Spring seedinr is nearly
finished except on the low. h^avy lands, and
t#w rcriy seeded wheat, barlej- and oat* have
Â«il c^^rne up to good stands. Pasturage. prasÂ»
<<s sni Fuch forap? plants as vetch and cheat
axe doing e^Jtndldiy. Stock continues improv
ir.g and the Sew of milk in the da'.ry herds
Is excellent. Sheep shearing Is well under
way. with the indications that the clip will
be an average one.
" "In a few localities hoi* have be?n injured
fcy froet. and the vine* everywhere have not
done so we'.] as they did the previous week-
Trie cu?tlvation of the hep yards for the first
Time has been practically completed, and the
Jsops are now nearly to the top of the pcles.
or twir.e. a* the case may be. Gardens are
backward, and some tender varieties of vege

for corn, but not much has yet been planted.

The rrivat* wires of Mitchell, Mu'.eahy &

flnr.rifs>5 and food Judges look for higher rates

ness throughout the country, is undermining
public confidence in the stack market to com*
<3Â«-Â»reÂ«. The recent selling of Steel Is re
ported to represent Schwab holdings. Steel
ummon Is now down to $9 12%. About a

tamed level of the foreign exchange rate makes
it evident that the movement has -not lost its
force, and estimates vary widely as to Us
limits. wMch have already reached over $40,
0tÂ».(ioo since Its Inception In April. A large
portion of the Panama canal payment remains
to be provided for and the current outgo evi
dently is to meet other requirements than the
l'ar.ama payment. For one thing..--' It Is ad- i
imtted that to-day's enffapement j s j n part
against a subscription to the Russian loan,
which was taken yesterday. The steady In
flow of Japanese gold t<j o,ur Pacific Coast has
been an Important offset to New York's ex
portf. The point ; Is made, however, that thÂ«
sub*crlrtlons to the Japanese loan here will
check the Inflow of gold at San Francisco by
providing funds here for Japan to draw upon,
while drafts may be made also upon that
fund for payments In England, thus adding
to the demand for gold exports. Meantime
the Treasury Department ha* sent notice of
the withdrawal of the final 10 per cent ln
ttallment of 4<> per cent of Government de
r>o*its with banks on May 25. These with
drawals, when completed, will have taken
something like $50,000,000 from the banks.
The rold movement shared Influence with the
continuing effect of the crop conditions and
Ceclinini? tendency of the iron and steel trade.
United Â£tcte* Steel common established a new
low record to-day and the preferred stock
suffered acutely from the discussion of its
prospects for maintained dividends. Further
reports were received of decreased railroad
i earnings. The feeling of genera! distrust over
the stability of the market led to free throw
ing ever of stock* and the eharp breaks in
prices on the day. Late covering by room

the library for the blind.
Here's a clever thingâ and a kindly
thing â for a bonny bunch of high
school girls to do! There is, as every
one knows, a library In this city for
the blind, they whose eyes lie in their
finger tips. Now, that library â made
possible by Mrs. Josephine Morris de
Greayer and other kindly people-^needs
more point books, and needs them bad
ly. That's the only way our blind
brethren can know the written
thoughts of their fellows, and how
they crave that bit of knowledge gain
ed so painstakingly! But more books
cost money! I mentioned the matter
to a few healthy, happy, hearty high
school girlsâ and the riddle waa soon
solved. "We'll give a performance of
the play we're studying," said they,
all In a chorus; "we'll give 'As You
Like It' and Paul â¢ Gersoif shall train
usâ if he will." Well, Mr. Gerson was
promptly persuaded and the drill has
been gcrlnrr on quietly but diligently for
two months; the maids go through
their paces In admirable style â in as
tonishing style^ â unless you have Ellen
Terry in your mind.
The final performance will take
place on May 20. at 8:15 p. m.. Native

Judge Coffey made an order yester
day denying the application of' E.
Algeltinger and D. B. Faktor for a re
vocation of thr order admitting the
will of John Wolf to probate. He held
that the petitioners did not present
sufficient evidence to support their
claim that Wolf is alive. Wolf was
formerly a member of the liquor firm
of Wolf, Wreden & Co., In 1889 he
disappeared and it was charged that
he had misused the funds of an estate
placed in his care. Several years
after his disappearance Mary Wolf,
his wif 5,^offered hiswill for probate,
claiming that she had proof that Wolf
had been drowned at Seattle. The will
was admitted and the estate of Wolf
was taking the usual course of estates
when Aigeltinger and Faktor came
Into court, asserting that, they had
ample proof that only a year, ago
Wolf had been seen on the streets of
Seattle and in Nome.

A number of the smaller shippers
along the river have been In this city

officials, and have admitted that their
visit was in connection with the plans
as mentioned above, which are being
carried out under the direction of Man
ager Leeds of the Santa Fe refrigerator
car department Leeds has lately made
several trips to points along the river,
and it Is said that he will In a few
days formally put into execution hi3
scheme for combating the Southern Pa
cific. The Santa Fe purposes to operate
three steamers on the Sacramento, at
the start, and it is claimed that the
company has secured a light draught
boat that will navigate a number of
miles above Sacramento. These boats
will travel from place to place at the
beck and call of shippers, gathering
freight and taking It to Antioch or to
this city and Richmond. The / flfht

will be watched by all railroad men
concerned in the handling of the North
ern California fruit crop.
The Southern Pacific Company has
announced that it will furnish a service
to Chicago this year within 168 hours,
and the Santa Fe has responded that It
Is prepared to guarantee a similar
schedule. . ,
pany claim that a rebate system Is the
means by which the refrigerator car
service keeps a firm grip on the bulk
of the business in Northern California,
and the Santa Fe purposes to a'dopt a
similar system to encourage the move
ment of fruit over Its line. In this way,
it is claimed, the small shippers along
the river will Increase their business,
and once on a footing with the larger
concerns, which have practically dom
inated in the distributors' association,
they will be able to force the latter to
fully recognize the Santa Fe.

Fuchs annulled, claiming that at the
time it was performed she was the
wife of another man from whom she
had never been divorced. She proved
this in court April 8 last, and five min
utes after the marriage was annulled
Fuchs took out a marriage license and
wedded his stepdaughter. Judge Ker
rigan performed the ceremony. He

a few weeks after she became his wife
she misconducted herself with one Wil
liam Spanuth.
Emma J. West, who is suing Joseph
West for divorce on the ground of
cruelty, yesterday answered his cross
complaint, in which she is accused of
misconducting herself with John F.
Nellson, a Mlddleton, Lake County,
gallant, by making a general denial of
his charge. She says West brought the
charge against her merely to cause her
humiliation and to disgrace her, and
she wants It to be considered by the
court as but an act of cruelty on his
part. .

Dr. J. A. Noble, who was married to
Elizabeth Noble at Santa Clara in Sep
tember, 1889. has filed suit for the an
nulment of his marriage. He says that
when the marriage was performed
Mrs. Noble was insane and that in
January, 1901, she was committed to

Hugo Fuchs and Selma' Fuchs lived
happily together when they were not
bound by matrimonial ties. They were
happy even though two children were
born to them, and they were happy
even in the-face of the fact that Fuchs
was his consort's stepfather, and that
her mother, who had been married to
Fuchs some years ago, when her
daughter was a mere child, lived in
the same house with them. Then for
the sake of the children Mrs., Fucha

Everett Abbott, the absconding treas
urer of the American Marine Transpor
tation Company of Boston, Mass., was
arrested at Market and Powell streets
yesterday by Detectives Gibson and
Bunner and locked up In "the tanks"
at the City Prison. The Boston au
thorities were notified and a reply
was received that an officer would bo
sent on at once with the necessary
papers for Abbott's extradition.
Abbott absconded on March 15 last
and an examination of his books, It 1m
alleged, showed a deficiency of $5852.
The American Surety Company of New
York had given bonds for Abbott to
the Transportation Company and the
surety company issued circulars con
taining a photograph of Abbott and a
full description and asking for his ar
rest. In the circular it was stated that
Abbott was fond of playing billiards
and pool and also j playing the races
and speculating in stocks.
It was his fondness for billiards and
pool that led to his arrest. The police
became aware of the fact that a man
answering his descriptidn had been for
.the last two or three days visiting bil
llard-robms at Powell and Eddy streets.
When the detectives went there yes
terday Abbott had Just left the placo
and they caught him at . Market and
Powell streets. He did not deny his
Identity and said he would be willing
to go back without the necessity of
extradition proceedings. He said he
was not the man responsible for the
defalcations and was not afraid of the
consequences. After leaving Boston he
went to Mexico and arrived in this
city a few days ago.. He is 28 years
of age and of. gentlemanly appearance.
Numerous other messages of a hu
morous character were read from
prominent State and National officials.
Each created much laughter.
One of the brightest speeches of the
evening was delivered by Judge Mogan,
who responded to the toast "The La
dles." He was applauded again and'
again.
Among the other speakers who made
happy hits were Thomas F. Boyle,
School Director; Alfred Roncovierl,
president of the Board of Education;
George B. Keane, secretary to the
Mayor, and Dr. Joseph F. Pohelm of
the- Board of Health. Altogether there
were more than 300 present at the ban
quet.
Judge Cabanlss: If you will let me out on
my O. R., I will be pleased to Join you to
night at the festivities.

ADDRESSES BY OTHERS.
Hon. Bob Wall, â¢ President of i Newsboys*
Union of San Francisco: As this banquet
will probably bust the treasury I decline to
participate, but thank you Just the same. -
TOMMY RIDGE, Treasurer.
Newsboys' Union of San Francisco: Feelfhg:
that you elected me and Mayor Schmitz and
Judge Cabaniss I would certainly have
been present at your banquet to-night If I
had known about it or been asked.
v O. C. PAUDEE, Governor.
Kins Leo de Bernardi: I yield homage to
your most royal nibs and regret that I can
not be with you. as I was not invited.
. * . Ti ROOSEVELT.
Mayor Schmitz's address was the
gem of the evening. He told how thirty
years ago he fought for a corner on
Pine and Montgomery streets from
which to sell papers. Then he saw
many famous men, many of whom
have since passed away, and he won
dered then if there would ever come a
time when he, too,' might be known
outside of his narrow sphere as a news
boy and have an opportunity to extend
to the struggling urchins the kindness
and encouragement he had received
from those noted customers. The time
had come, he said, when in his official
capacity as Mayor s ot a great city he
was enabled to tell the newsboys that
In everything they did rightly he would
stand by them, and that their delin
quencies, due to youth and exuberance,
would always be considered from his
standpoint with leniency.
Among the funny stunts introduced
during the speeches by Toastmaster
Ruef were the following supposititious
telegrams:
SCHMITZ'S GREAT SPEECH.
NEWSBOYS ARE IIAPPY.
Dougherty and Bernardi were indus
triously happy' In caring for their
guests. The banquet was spread in
the main dining hall of the restaurant
and a view of the room showed many
incongruities from a society standpoint.
Famous men in literature were chaffing
with equally famous newspaper ven
dors. High public officials chatted over
the- striped bass, with boys from whom
they bought papers. Toasts were passed
between the sometime delinquents in
the courts and the police judges. Abe
Ruef presided as toastmaster. Mayor
Schmitz sat at the head of the table.
Altogether it was . one of the most
democratic and enjoyable events that
has ever been witnessed in any city.
Ruef was an ideal toastmaster, witty
and opportune in every Instance, and
with the saving grace of not laughing
at his own jokes. One of the best he
passed out happened while he was in
troducing Police Judge Cabanlss. He
said he was about to present a man
who could deliver a long sentence in
two words. Cabaniss made an extreme
ly happy address in response 'and had
the newsboys on their feet before he
finished.
â¢ Official dignity was chaff in the wind
lust night at the complimentary ban
quet tendered by the newsboys of San
Francisco to Mayor Schmitz. The ban
quet was given at Jules' restaurant'on
Pine street. The Mayor made the best
speech of his life and then he sang the
chorus of "My Own United States."
Guests and hosts r^se to their feet at
the beginning of the strain and re
mained standing until he had finished.
It was the second time the Mayor ever
sang In public and his effort was for
the pleasure of the boys who peddle
the daily papers. He developed a
splendid barytone voice and every one
present was fairly carried off his feet
by the melody.
There were other picturesque features
of the banquet. Nearly every prom
inent municipal officer of San Francisco
was present, flanked on every side by
newsboys. For the most part the offi
cials 4 were the speakers. "Happy"
Dougherty, who finally owned to the
fact that his initials were "J. H.," and
Leon de Bernardi, "king of the news
boys," as he is called, were the only
members of the newsboys' union who
took the floor, except one kid named
Hogan. Early In the evening he sang
a sons entitled "Please Save Mother's
Shoestrings From the Sale." When he
reached the emotional part his pipes
got clogged and he begged the ban
queters. to excuse him. They insisted
on him proceeding and he 'finished ' in
fine style.

To further this scheme it is said that
the Santa Fe refrigerator car service is
prepared, if necessary, to make special
concessions to these shippers in order
to stimulate business. The Inducement
offered is said to be in the nature of a
rebate on icing charges in addition to
an assurance of Quick service to Chi-
C *fh"ose who pretend to be thoroughly
acquainted with the relations between
the big shippers and the Armour Com-
KEHATES OX ICING.
The hand of the Santa Fe 1b begin
ning to show Itself In the plan of the
company to Invade the deciduous fruit
territory of Northern California In com
petition with the Southern Pacific.
When the latter several days ago an
nounced that It had severed relations
with Its rival In so far as a division of
fruit traffic was concerned the news
was accepted b'y the majority of the
lecal railroad representatives as the
signal for the withdrawal of the Santa
Ffc's plans for operating steamers on
the Sacramento River and handling the
fruit by way of Antioch over Its own
line into the markets of Chicago. It
has since developed that the Santa Fe
Is at work in the Sacramento River
district on an entirely new plan, which
Involves the establishing of shipping
agents at every important point along
the river, with a view of not only
handling through freight, but every
kind of commodity that its boats can
transfer to Antioch, or even bring di
rect to this city.
It Is charged by the Santa Fe people
that the majority of shippers in the
Sacramento River district have become
so closely allied with the Southern Pa
cific Company and the Armour Refrig
erating Car Company that they cannot
well afford to give the Santa Fe a
share of their business. Accepting this
as the correct situation, the agents of
the Santa Fe are now engra-ged in nego
tiations with many of the smaller ship
pers, who have heretofore cut little fig
ure In the fruit traffic, with a view of
havinp them enter into an alliance
with their road.
