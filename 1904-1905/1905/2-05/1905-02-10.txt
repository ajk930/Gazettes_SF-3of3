Several of the Senators, led by
what they believed to be the rights

they be heard under oath in their
own behalf, others fought for the
privilege for the accused through
motives of personal friendship,
but a majority, determined that
full justice should be done, let
the consequences be what they
may, stood firmly and unswerv

Senate take no action that would
stay the machinery of the law and
they won their fight. By a vote
of 22 to 13 the Senate declared
that the accused must stand trial

story as at the Senate investigation
at the Capitol last night. Detectives
George N. Tichenor and Henry Hart
ling were also called into the Jury
chamber. They testified *to the Inci
dents of their connection with the case.
The Grand Jury then entered into a
discussion of the scandal, especially
with reference to Its legal powers. ,
At the conclusion of the conference
District Attorney Seymour visited Su
perior Judge E. C. Hart and notified
him that the Grand Jury would be pre
pared to enter his court at 7 o'clock
this evening and present a report.
Judge Hart returned from his home,
the courthouse was lighted and at 7:30 .
o'clock the Grand Jury entered his de
partment, accompanied by the District
Attorney, and reported that it had
found true bilis against Senators
Bunkers, Wright. Emmons and French,
charging them with soliciting and re
ceiving a bribe. Judge Hart ordered
the indictments filed, fixed the bond at
$5000 in each case and on motion of the
District Attorney ordered the Issue of
bench warrants for the arrest of the
accused legislators.
WARRANTS ARE ISSUED.
The warrants were placed in the

turned, with Senators French and
Bunkers in custody: They were permit
ted the freedom of the outer office until
their friends should procure bondsmen
for them. French was arrested in the
corridor of the Capitol. Bunkers ap
peared in buoyant spirits, but French
seemed to regard the proceeding less
in the light of a joke, and sat nervously
smoking a cigar and apparently oblivi
ous to the presence of a crowd and its
chatter.
Assistant Sergeant-at-arms Edward
I Short soon appeared and consulted
j with Judge Hart with reference to the
approval of bonds. Short left the court
house, saying he would soon return
with the sureties.
The indictments of the Grand Jury
were brought under section 86 of tha
Penal Code, which defines the soliciting
and acceptance of a bribe by a legis
lator as a felony and fixes the penalty
on conviction at not less than one nor
more than fourteen years and-, provid
ing that the person so convicted shall
forfeit his office, be disfranchised and
forever forbidden from holding office
again.
The next step in the cases will be
the bringing of the accused Senators
into court and their arraignment. They
will be tried by Jury, the prosecution
to be conducted by the District Attor
ney and the expense of the trial to be
borne by Sacramento County. The con
stitution protects members of the Leg
islature from service in a civil process
and from arrest for breach of the
peace while the Legislature is in ses
sion, but this provision does not save
them from criminal process and will
not Interfere with the regular course
of the present proceedings against
them.
EMMONS IS ARRESTED.
â¦ Senator Emmons was arrested in his
room at the State House Hotel. He
evidently had heard of the Indictment
and expected arrest, as he showed no
surprise when Deputy Sheriff Conran
entered and served the warrant on him.
Sheriff Reese and Deputy Witten
brock spent several hours searching for
Wright. Bunkers, French and Emmons
were released on bonds in the stun of
$5000 each, which Judge Hart approved.
Bunkers' sureties were J. D. Moffatt
of Alameda County and J. M. Kelley,
a Supervisor of Alameda County.
French was liberated on bonds fur
nished by Edward Short, assistant ser
geant at arms of the Senate, and J. L.
Woods of Sacramento County. Em
mons furnished bondsmen In the per
sons of H. T. Sllvius and Frank Ruh
staller Jr. of Sacramento.
District Attorney Seymour said to
night: "It has been stated that tbÂ«
' Sacramento Grand Jury hag been un
i reasonable In reaching a decision with
I respect to these cases. As a matter
lof fact there has b*en no delay. On
I Tuesday, January 31, I went to San
: Franchwo to ascertain some necessary
I facts and got home on Tuesday night.

i man the next morning and it was de
f cided to call the Grand Jury together
I a-: the earliest possible hour. As many

; tions of the county and others were/
I outside the county it was dimmed Â»Â»'
practicable to get the body together

"I wish to say that I shall treat

I course of my official duties. I shall
conduct them fairly and dispassion
ately, with the view to getting at all
the truth and making the strongest
. possible presentation, at the same time
treating the defendants with absolute
fairness."
At 11:30 o'clock Senator Wright had
not been located and Judge Hart left
for his home for the night.

the progress of the debate, Senator
Selvage tit Humbo came -.nine de
tense of. the boodlers in a manner that
astyunded his associates, without
doubt even the accused, Car In him they
found a champion that went further
in .his criminations and recriminations
than the judgment of most lawyers
would have led them had they been
making final argument before the bar
of a criminal court. Selvage demanded
that the accused be heard; he defied
the press and defied public opinion, ex
pressed the well-grounded -opinion that
he would be conaemned for the stand
lie had taken, characterized the acts of
the District Attorney of Sacramento as
despicable, damned the corporation he
eaid had dragged innocent men out :
and debauched them, and,' in conclu
sion, said: "Joseph Jordan, hated and
dtspised is the dogs on the street, the
despicable Joseph Jordan, the , briber,
the criminal," occupied no lower foot
ing than does Clarence Grange, mana
ger of the Phoenix Insurance Com
pany, who laid the trap that brought
Selvage's colleagues to the door of the .
penitentiary.
Senator Ward, however, did not let
Sejv&ge'c roar of protest pass unchal
lenged. In a quiet voice he pointed
Â«>ut to the Senator from the north that
the District Attorney's motives and
acts are based on the highest ethical
and legal principles and that to con
demn him was but to bring condemna
tion upon the man that saw fit to
question his conduct. The introduc
tion of Selvage's speech was on the line
of a Fourth of July thesis on the birth
of Liberty, but it dropped down to the â 
level of an unbased defense of a quar
tet of rascals, and lower still when
with swinging arms he proclaimed that
the authorities of the law were but
seeking victims that they might rend
them asunder and take their blood at
r,ny cost. Justly or unjustly. But the
humor of the situation saved Selvage
from further attention at the hands of
his colleagues; they saw that he but
v ished that so great an occasion be not
allowed to pass by without his being ot ;
record as one of the strenuous partici
pants in the great debate.
I M\|<Â»\w MARKS PI.EA.
T*>e plea of Senator Emmons on the
floor for leniency at the hands of his
colleagues was the dramatic feature of
the day. Emmons had been sitting at
his derk with downcast eyes listening
to. the argument, and, finally, seeing
that the tide of opinion was against
him. rose and was recognized by the

LIKENS' RESOLUTION.
When Belehaw's report calling upon
the Senate for instruction was intro
duce Lu liens of Alameda moved that
the same be taken up for immediate
â  nnsideration. The motion carried and
be immediately introduced the follow
ing:
\\ hciea.-. The special committee of five ap

cnanea contained In the affidavit of. William
BÂ» m by him the I'Tth day of January,
â  Harry J. lju.sk. Notary Public,
etc., and read at the regular session of the
S'.-nat* of California on Monday, January :10,
1!Â»'J&. ha* ivjxjrted and presented to the Senate
for Its instrjctions a resolution herein quoted:
be ii
ved. That, in order completely to
vindicate justice, the said special committee
is hereby directed and instructed not to ad
ter an oath and examine any of th
Senator? thereunder as to any fact or act in
â¢ion with any of the- matters contained
In ;h<- said affidavit of William Certain abovq
mentioned.
SIMPSON ON THE FLOOR.
Senator Shortridge suggested that
the form of the resolution be changed
so as to make it a declarative question
when it came to the vote striking out
the word "Not" in the last paragraph,
M when the vote was called for the
ayes would declare for the swearing
of the accused and the noes against
it, instead of the reverse, as would
be done la event the resolution went
In unamended. The call for the ques
tion brought Senator Simpson, a mem
ber of the investigating committee,
forward with a substitute resolution,
which follows:
Whereas. It appears that in course of the in
vestigation now pending before a special com
mittee of th- Senate, in the matter of certain
Senators accused of receiving bribes, that cer
tain ones of said Senators have presented
themselves before said committee lor the pur
pose of being sworn and testifying as wit
nesses, 1 and
Whereas, If said investigation is to continue
it will be in violation of the commonest prin
ciples of human liberty to d-Â°ny to any- of said
Senators the right to be sworn and testify,
and
Whereas, The maximum penalty which can
be Imposed by th- Senate in case of the further
prosecution of said charges and the con\Jc
tion of said Senators thereunder is simple ex
pulsion from tbÂ«.- Senate, and it' they are
sworn as witnesses and give testimony as such
in said investigation they become thereby ab
solved from any criminal prosecution, and
Whereas, Said penalty is inadequate to meet
the gravity of said charges, but that under
the criminal laws and constitution of the State
th^re .re adequate penalties which, in case of
conviction in the courts of the land, include
deprivation of office and imprisonment for fel
ony, and
Whereas, The District Attorney of Sacra
mento County Is now preparing with the Grand
Jury of said county to commence a prosecution
of said charges in 'due course of criminal law,
which " would â  be defeated by any farther â¢in
vestigation by the Senate, under rules of com
mon decency, not to mention law, -.that is' to
cay, by any furtlier investigation at which any
Of said accused Senators should give testimony,
under- oath, they having ..refused otherwise to
make any statement. Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That no further investigation of
said" charge* br had by thlÂ« Senate and that
the â¢rial "committee of . investigation thereof
and the same is hereby discharged in order
that the charges mentioned may be tried in
the due iÂ»nd orderly course of criminal law
and the guilty ones, if any, be brought to
adequnte punishment. â  ,
. "This resolution." said Shortridge,
"should not pass. It is naught but an
argument that may tend to influence
the vote of the Senators on this grave
question that confronts us."
STANDS BY RESOLUTION.
LvfceflÃ wanted to know if Simp
son's resolution had the concurrence of
his associates on the committee, but
Shortridge protested against an an
swer being given, saying the Question
was highly improper. President An
n ruled otherwise, however, and
said he saw absolutely no impropriety
iv tho question, and Simpson answered
that he had not submitted the resolu
tion to his colleagues on the committee.
Belshaw said that, while he felt Simp
son's resolution was not germane to the
question under discussion, its adop
tion would be an injustice to the com
mittee, in that it would prevent a
further consideration of the charges
against the accused. He saitl he would
like to have Simpson withdraw his res
olution, that the whole attention of
the Senate could be directed to a con
sideration of the question of whether
the accused should be given the right
to testify.
Simpson refused to withdraw the
resolution, however, saying he did not
think it right that the accused should
be denied the right of a hearing; that
if the Senate voted to refuse the right
to the accused to appear in their own
behalf it would be saying to them:
"Your accusers have had their day in
court and have proved their case, but
It is not for yon to be given the priv
ilege of a hearing. You must get out
of court."
Senator Anderson said he did not
see how the committee could stay its
investigation at this time. Cator, for
the defense, had said last night that
he had other witnesses to testify and
that further than this the Senate had
no means of knowing whether or not
the accused might not decide later to
take the stand and make statements
not under oath, which action would in
no â way immune them from prosecu
tion in event they are later found to
be guilty.
DUTY OF SENATE.
Lukens gaid that his view of the
situation was that but one question,
the duty of the Senate to the State,
was involved. The courts, he
said, had been established through
a wise system for the protec
tion of society and he did
not believe the Senate should take any
action that would tend to prevent an
infliction on the guilty of the pains
and penalties that would follow con
viction. He did not mean to prejudice
the accused, he said in conclusion,
but it was plain that if the Senators
charged were guilty then the Senate
was powerless to inflict upon them,
punishment to the crime; that all It
could do was to expel the accused if
they were found guilty.
Senator Curtin here entered the ar
gument. He said it was not within
his province to say the accused were
guilty or not guilty, but he appreciat
ed the fact that the people of the
state look fairly on the case and de
mand that the Senate do its duty.
"We should not," he said, "sink the
rights of the people and the rights of
the accused in one common grave. We
should not place any obstacle in the
way of what the officials of the State
assume to bo their highest duty. Lu
kens' resolution is straightforward;
Birapaen't reaches something of the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 10. 1905.
SENATOR LUKENS' RESOLUTION.
WHEREAS, The special committee of five appointed by the Senate
of California on the 30th day of January, A. D. 1905, to investi
gate the charges contained in the affidavit of William Corbin,
sworn to by him the 27th day of January, 190?, before Harry J. Usk,
notary public, etc., and read at the regular session of the Senate of
California on Monday, January 30, 190>, has reported and presented to
the Senate for its instructions a resolution herein quoted,
1 Be it resolved, That, in order completely to vindicate justice,
the said special committee is hereby directed and instructed not
to administer an oath and examine any of the said Senators there
under as to any fact or act in connection with any of the matters
contained in the said affidavit of William Corbin above mentioned.
Lukens' Resolution Taking
Case Out of Hands of
the Senate Is Adopted
can be upheld and we must not fail i
to see this way."
MANTLE OF CHARITY.
Hahn said that he felt he voiced the
sentiment* of all of his colleagues when j
he said that he thought the present was
the most trying moment of his life. He
i said that he was ready if he thought
the interests of justice would be sub
served to tnrow the mantle of charity
1 around the accused, but he could see
j no way in which the Senate could in
I honor place the accused in a position
j where they would be absolved from
punishment for bribery if they are
proven guilty.
"Are we to place these men in a po
sition," he continued, "where they can
not be punished for their crimes if they
are guilty? Shall we say that though
we know they are guilty we do not pur
pose seeing them punished; it is ter
rible to think here about what we must
do perhaps when it comes to a final
vote on this question. The courts are
j open to these men and under the law
i they are guaranteed a fair and impar
| tial trial and in voting upon these res
! olutions it rests with us to say whether
the law shall take its course."
Senator Ralston said he thoueht the
I integrity of the Senate was involved
and he thought the investigation
' should continue to the end. He did not
believe Simpson's resolution should be
adopted and said that he would vote
against it when the call was made.
Senator Wolfe then took up the argu
ment against the effort that was being
made to deny the accused the right to
testify. He advanced, he said, the
broad principle that every man is en
titled to a hearing and that the Senate.
by denying these men the right to
vote would prejudge them guilty, there
by casting aside the presumption that
every man accused is innocent until
proved guilty.
woi.fe a defkxder.
Continuing Senator Wolfe said:
"It is the duty of the Senate to Dut
this committee in a composition where
it can hear evidence for and against
the accused men. thus enabling the
committee to bring in a report so the
Senate may be able to reach a conclu
sion.
"No greater punishment could be in
| flirted upon a Senator than to brand
him a felon and send him adrift in the
world. There is not a Senator on the
| floor but who would rather be rottine
in his grave than to be so branded by
the Senate.
"Put the Senators under oath, and if
they testify falsely prosecute them for
I t-rjury. The majesty of the law can
be vindicated by guaranteeing these
men a fair trial by the Senate, and then
let the able and fearless District At
torney of Sacramento County act as he
sees fit afterward. This Senate has no
assurance that the Grand Jury of Sac
ramento County would do its duty if
thf Senate refused to act."
At the conclusion of Wolfe's address
adjournment was taken until 2 o'clock.
When the Senate reconvened Short
ridge reopened the debate. He demand-
I ed that the Senate grant the right to
the accused to be heard, basing his ar
gument on the broad principles of jus
tice as he saw them, and though his
I address was a brilliant effort the only
j effect it produced was a general regard
for his eloquence and little for his the
ory.
Senator Shortridge argued that Dis
trict Attorney Seymour of Sacramento
County had misinterpreted the law, j
; which says. "No person sworn and ex-
I amined before either house of the Leg
islature or any committee thereof can
be held to answer criminally or be sub
ject to any penalty or forfeiture for
any fact or act touching which he is re
quired to testify."
SHORTRJDGE FOR LAW.
The Senator contended that the men
are not required to testify, and he be
lieved they should be sworn. He said
the action of the Senate would not bar
prosecution by the courts â tha.t they
could be punished either for bribery or
for falsely testifying.
Shortridge said he was always for the
law, and he stood for the rights of the
accused Senators. Laws had been made
giving rights, and protection to men,
and they were entitled to offer their
defense under the law. He did not
think it would be right to gag these
men, to bind, to crucify them, just be
cause of public opinion. Senator Short
ridge reminded the Senators that they
had not made the existing law; it had
been on the books for a long time.
Shortridge said the Senate would be
violating one of the most sacred rights
of men, handed down for ages, if it
denied the right to testify. Popular
opinion seems against the men, the
j newspapers are against them, the peo
', pie are inflamed and are demanding
i punishment without hearing-, but per
j sonally he proposed to plead for the
! Senators because they had a God-given,
j a constitutional right to be heard.
IMPORTANT POINT.
Anderson again entered the debate
at this point and said that whatever
decision Bhould be reached regarding
whether or not the accused should be
given the right to testify he did not
believe the investigation should stop,
&3 provided in the resolution presented
by Simpson. An important point that
suggested ifself to him was that last
night Jordan, in making his confes
sion, testified directly opposite to
Clarence Grange and it was apparent
that more evidence was necessary, to
establish, if possible, which of the two
told the truth. "If Mr. Grange and his
associates deliberately placed tempta
tion in the way of these mciv before
they made a demand upon them,,- if
they ever did," said Anderson, "they
are more guilty than the accused Sen
ators, granting for the purpose of ar
gument that the Senators are guilty.
j There are many honest men and virtu
[ ous women in this land who lay claim
â¢ alone to their honesty and virtue be- |
! cause they never have been tempted, j
j J submit that this investigation do not i
I ctase, but that it proceed to the end."
Senator Emmons here asked to be
hoard and made his plea for justice. ]
He was followed by Selvage, who de- I
livered himself of the attack on At- j
torney Seymour. Senator Savage then i
arose and also expressed himself as '
Tiarless of the public press and asked
that the accusfed be given the right to
a hearing. Senator Ward followed, ,
saying in part:
WARD'S OPPOSITION.
"I am opposed to the resolution in
troduced by Senator Simpson, for if it
passes it will indicate that the Senate
has faltered in the face of its plain
duty. I deprecate the attack that has
been made here by Senator Selvage on
the District Attorney of this county
and while he condemns that fearless
public official 1 commend Seymour on
the stand he took. It was proper to
take the action he did, for it was with
in the line of his duty. The attack
upon him I wish to characterize as ill
timed, unwise and unjust. But now I
want to raise a point here for your con
sideration.
"Is there any one here on this Senate
floor that would be willing to place
greater credence in the statements of
any of the accused than in tl\e state
ments they made here before this body
when they were first accused. They
stood here and stated, each of them,
that so- far as they were concerned the
charge was absolutely and unqualified
ly false. What more can they do if
sworn before the committee?
"If they received this money they
ought to be in the penitentiary. If
they are sworn there will be then no
way, even ifr they are guilty, by which
they can be punished criminally for
having accepted bribes. There is no
occasion for their testifying 1 . They have
already done this before the entire Sen
ate. I favor Senator Lukens' resolution
denying them the right to testify and
thus jeopardizing the rights of the peo
ple and the good order of the State."
81-XSIIAW ORATES.
Senator Belshaw next rose and took
to task those ihat had had so much
to say regarding the condemnation of
the accused by the press and by pub
lic opinion. He said that any one that
sought to lean an argument on the con
demnation of the accused by the pub
lic press was assuming a great deal and
all the talk of the bravery of those that
face the criticism of the press was to be
deprecated. He said he presumed that
the same courage they assumed to
themselves belonged to every member
of the committee of which he was
chairman and that, the only reason his
committee came before the Senate to
seek instruction was that it wished to
do an injustice to no man; that the
question that had arisen was one the
entire Senate should finally decide.
Anderson at this poirft made a mo
tion that the entire question be finally
deferred until to-morrow, but he was
defeated. Carter then said that the
Senate should proceed cautiously; that
ft ur members bt the body were facing
damning testimony which the Senate
could not afford to ignore and he
thought it advisable that Simpson's
resolution providing for the abandon
ment ot proceedings be voted down
j without delay. Irish raised the point
that in his opinion no harm could
ccme through permitting the accused
to testify, because, he said, in his opin
ion the section of the Political Code It
T/as said, would immune the accused
ffom prosecution in event they were
permitted to testify, had been super
seded by section 35 of article IV of
the State constitution.
WARM DEBATE.
Shortridge and Lukens then engaged
in a warm debate as to the merits of
the original resolution by Lukens or
Its amendment to declarative form by
Shortridge. After some debate Short
ridge, agreeing that the accused
should not be given immunity from
punishment in event their guilt is
established by the commission, of
fered another resolution to the amend
ment as follows:
"Be It resolved, That if any of the
accused Senators shall present them
selves before the special committee to
ttstify that the said committee be and
is hereby instructed to swear such
Senators and take their testimony un
der oath."
Shortridge held that if passed in this
form the Senators would in no way be
absolved from prosecution, for if they
were simply permitted to make state
ments and were not "required" to
make them they could not plead the
giving of such testimony as a bar to
further proceedings against them.
The call for the vote on Simpson's
resolution was then demanded and it
was beaten by a vote of 38 to 2.
Shortridge's amendment to Lukens'
resolution met a. like fate by a vote of
23 to 11. The call for a vote on Lukens'
resolution was next made and when it
reachea Bauer he asked to he excused
from voting. The reason for his ac
tion was demanded and he said that
as a member of the Committee on Com
missions and Retrenchment he be
lieved that there was some feeling
against him by the accused and that
he did not wish to be placed in a posi
tion where it might be said that he
had been influenced In his vote by this
condition. He was assured that no
such construction would be considered
by the Senate and he then voted In
favor of the resolution. It carried by a
vote of 22 to 13, and the investigating
â committee, under its terms, left the
chamber positively instructed not to
swear the accused. This act sealed the
fate of the -accused and turned- them
over to be dealt with as the law pro
vides.
WARRANTS ISS.EO FOR SENATORS
Continued From Page 1, Column 2.
crossing the bay with Bunkers on
the afternoon just previous to the
time the conversations between
himself and Grange took place, he
requested Bunkers to defer the is
suing of the subpena in the case
of the Phoenix Association until
he (Jordan) could have a talk
with Grange. This corroborates
Grange's statement that Jordan
approached him first on the sub
ject of securing money to pay
the Senators for immunity.
On further cross-examination
-Jordan admitted that after the ex
pose he tried to have the money
gathered up and handed over to
him. so he could hand it back to
Grange and make it appear it
had never passed. He went to
Emmons, who saw the point and
said he would get the bills to
gether.
When he approached French
about giving the money back
French asked him, "What mon
ey?" He did not see Wright.
Bunkers was too excited to talk
coherently.
Jordan went to San Francisco
the next morning and when he
got back Tuesday evening he was
taken into custody, so he had no
chance to find out whether Em
mons had succeeded in getting
hold of the bills.
Unimportant witnesses were
examined after Jordan left the
stand and then it was announced
that the cases of both the prose
cution and defense had rested.
Xext Monday night counsel will
analyze the testimony that has
been introduced. Then will come
the verdict, and it is predicted it
will be expulsion.
INSURANCE CO.MPACTS.
Committee Considers Measure Declar
ing Them Illegal.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 9.â The Assem
bly Committee on Insurance and Insur
ance Laws this evening considered
Assemblyman Hartman's bill making
compacts between insurance companies
illegal. Robprt Hunter, attorney for
the Firemen's Fund Insurance Com
pany of San Francisco, was before the
committee and said the bill, if it be
came a law, would injure the Fire
men's Fund greatly, as it would result
in its being prevented from doing busi
ness in other States.
Assemblyman Hartman said his was
a "good, virtuous and righteous" meas
ure and a protection to the merchant
and poor man. Hunter said the bill
was not a new one. but was identical
with a malodorous measure introduced
by Assemblyman Bretz of Alameda
fourteen years ago.
Chairman Bates of the committee
announced that the hearing will be re
sumed to-morrow and that T. C. Coo
gan, attorney for the Mutual Fire In
surance Company of San Francisco, I
would appear In opposition to the bill.

Repeats Tale of Corruption
DECLARES HE MADE EFFORTS
TO GET MARKED NOTES BACK
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACKAMKXTO, Feb. 9.â When the
; Belshaw committee resumed the hear
] ing of the case of the accused Senators
I this evening the chairman said he
wished embodied in the record a certi
fied copy of the resolution under which
the Senate decided that the Senators
J accused should not be allowed to tes
1 tify. The resolution was read and made
I a part of the record of the commlttfe
; proceedings.
"I should like to ask." said Cator,,
"whether the committee adopts this as
its rule of action?"
"Yes, having been so instructed by
the Senate," replied Chairman Bel- j
shaw.
J "I suppose the first business is. the
I cross-examination of Jordan," said
! Cator.
"It is," replied Belshaw. "Do you
wish to cross-examine him?"
"We do not," was the reply. "His tes
timony is satisfactory to us as it
stands."
"We have .some questions that we
wish to ask Mr. Jordan." said Nlcol.
"We object to this witness being |
cross-examined by the other side," said
Cator.
"He was produced as a witness of the
prosecution. li&st evening after the
committee had made its findings as to
the Senators' testifying it asked if '
either side had any more witnesses,
and Mr. McNab said his had. He went
across and spoke to Jordan, and he
took the stand. This witness has con
tradicted testimony given by their out
fit In the first part of this hearing, the
testimony of Mr. Grange, and now they
wish to straighten that out. It Is not
fair to allow them to cross-examine
Jordan when he has been their witness â¢
from the start."
"We did not speak to Jordan about
testifying and did not call him to the
stand," said McNab. "We were in
formed for the first time when we came |
here last night by the District Attnr- \
ney that Jordan would testify. The
subpena was issued by the commltte*
on its own responsibility."
"The opposing counsel possesses a !
superior knowledge that I cannot hope j
to aspire to," said Nicol. "When he |
says we want to patch up something
he uncovers a purpose we never
dreamed of. Two weeks ago when
this hearing began I said before this
committee that we were not here as
prosecutors. Our only purpose has
been to make the truth so conspicuous
that no one will doubt it. We do not
desire to aispute the testimony of this
witness, but desire to add corrobora
tion from his own lips."
OBJECTION OVERRULED.
"Tn view of the fact that this com
mittee must review all the testimony
before making a report. Mr. Oator's ob
jection is overruled," said Belshaw.
Jordan was then led over much of
the ground that he traversed in his
direct testimony. He identified the
key to his room given to Tichenor. He
became acquainted with Emmons dur
ing the session of 1897. Bunkers he
first met here two years aero. He met
Wright, who was then a member of the
Assembly at the same time.
The witness told about requesting of
Bunkers the night he met him on the
Oakland ferry-boat that the Commit
tee on Commissions defer action re
garding the Phoenix Association until
he could see Grange. Bunkers told
him the subpena would be held until
the following Tuesday. It was not is
sued during the time intervening, but
the witness did not know whether it
was because of the promise made by
Bunkers and the belief that there
might be something coming from
Grange or whether the committee was
busy with other matters.
Asked whether he had changed or
spent any of the bills given him Jordan
said he had disposed of two of them.
One had been changed by Horace
Pratt, cashier of the Phoenix, and the
other he had spent. He was a "little
hazy" about where this one had gone,
he said, but he was under the impres
sion he had used it to pay a bill.
Then came the most important part
of Jordan's testimony on cross-exam
' ination. Asked to tell all the conver
sations he had had with any of the ac
cused men after he had given them
the bribe money, he finally made this
statement:
"Monday, after the expose had been
made, I went to Emmons" room in the
State House and asked him to get the
Senators together, secure all the mon
ey I had passed them and hand It back
to me. I told him this was the only so
lution of the difficulty we were In."
TRIES TO GET MONEY.
"Can I trust you." he asked and I
said: "Certainly you can, you have to.
Whab good is the money to you. It is
marked and is dead money. None of
you can spend any of it."
The witness said Emmons understood
the money was marked. Continuing
Jordan said:
"When I told Emmons this, he said:
'That's so,' and added that he would
get all the money and hand it to me."
"I next saw French at Tenth and X
streets between 6 and 7 o'clock and
told him it was the best thing to get
all the money together and turn it
back. .He asked me 'what money.' 'You
know what money.' I replied. He then
asked me what paper I worked on, the
Bulletin or Post."
Jordan didn't get any satisfaction out
of French. He did not think he saw
Wright that night.
He did see Bunkers and had this to
say about it:
"Bunkers and I walked up Tenth
street to the Capitol. I told him the
same thing I had told Emmons. He
seemed wildly incoherent. He didn't
seem to know what to aay.
"I did not see any of the Senators
part with any of the money." Jordan
said. "None of them told me they had
parted with any."
"Did you go to them again after that
to see if they had got the money to
gether?" was asked of the witness.
"I went to San Francisco on the train
that left at 4 o'clock the next morning."
said Jordan, "and when I came back
Tuesday evening I was taken into cus
tody, so I had no chance to see the Sen
ators again."
Jordan corroborated Grange's testi
mony that he. Jordan, telephoned to
Grange after the reading of the Cor
bin affidavit to ask him what was do
ing:. He used the telephone in the Sur
veyor General's office. Th>- fitness
said Bunkers told him $10,000 was the
least thp committee would let the Con
tinental off for. as there had been so
much said that the Senate would raise
"old Ned" if a favorable report werÂ«
filed.
"Did he mention any newspaper""
was asked.
HXAMINKR WATCHFIL
"Well," he said, 'the Examiner <
watching every move and we
have to be careful with what we do. '
"Did he mention any other pi
on the schedule?"
"Only for the three companies that
have been spoken of."
* "Was there anything said to the p'
' feet that in east the companies di-l
not yield measures would be used to
cause their charters to be forfeited? "
"Bunkers said to me that some of
: the building and loan associations
j would better be careful or they wooM
lose their charters, as there was a bis
kick asainst them."
The witness said he thought he
knew what was meant by "being ear
ful." There was nothing definite
though; merely suggestions.
The witness said he had never had
any talk with any of the accused men
until that night on the boat. He
never heard Dodge's name mentioned.

Charles Vaughn, who is reporting the

and asked about the meetings of thÂ«
committee. He said he could remem
ber none of the conversations that toolc

The witness further testified that the

denied that they had done so.
CATOR PROTESTS.
Attorney Cator, representing the de
fense, was next called upon by the
committee and asked If he had any
thing further to present on behalf of
his clients.
"My clients." he said, "are being cru
cified in a fight between two news
papers and a powerful corporation. Th
powerful machinery of the law has
been set in motion, my clients have
been arrested And I have even been de
prived of their association. Without
their assistance I have no way of pro
ceeding, and I can do nothing but ar
gue the case on their behalf. This I
find is a situation of necessity, of com
pulsion. It is my wish to argrue that
the prosecution here has not estab
lished a case and under oath deny they
are guilty, have made such denial on
the floor of the Senate, and I have no
doubt that after a careful analvsfs
of the testimony introduced here that I
will be able to satisfy any reasonable
rommttee, and I presume that you cob*
stitute such, that the same does not
Jiustify the expulsion of these men from
the Senate."
"While we refuse to admit that wa
occupy the status of prosecutors In this
case." said McNab. "we wish to do our
full duty. We do m>t desire to arxu*
this case, feeling that it might place
us in a false position. A legal argu
ment from our side, we feel would be in
bad taste, and since we are called upon
to argue the matter wÂ« would rather be
excused."
Senator Simpson said that go far as
he was concerned he wanted to grtvÂ» thÂ»
defense every opportunity, and Sen
ator Belshaw. expressing the vi^
th* entire committee, said that counsel
would be granted a sitting that h
'mleht present his case as he saw fit. Tt
i was then agreed that as clients- of Mr.
McNab are directly Interested In the
outcome of the Investigation

the case. Monday evening was set ftrr
the argument, and on that date the
case will be concluded and Â«rubmlttÂ»d

the City Hall, assured, until yesterday,
that hard work was worth while, inas
much as he was being well paid for it.
MT'ST CTT HIS BILL.
There is no disputing that Young is
a first-class accountant, who can be
relied on to accomplish something. It
he that went deep into the
archives of the County Clerk's office a
> <>ar ago and unearthed shortages and
i^lsaprmpriation of funds in years
tang passed. Knowing of his abilities,
ihe present Grand Jury sought his ser
* ices and deemed it wise to pay him
the wage he demanded.
But Ka^hr declares that the bills will
: Â°main pigeonholed in his desk so
- as they are made out for more
than $." a day. He has no criticism to
make of Young or the Grand Jury, but
he must follow the law. Fore-
Man Andrews, confident of the omnipo
ot the Grand Jury, thinks he < an
fix the matter up somehow," but
Kaehr says he can't, for the law must
red.
It has been something of a mystery
"here the Grand Jury has obtained its
tiinds. The- members have been very
â i< tlve. have made free use of automo
biles, carriages, hotels and other aids
â¢ quick midnight work. There was no
:n the expense account In, the in
gation of the Chinatown scandal
r a'-ti'-ularly. The personal expenses of
man Andrews thus far have been
'. and this in items that cannot
forth in public records.
< ITY BEARS THE EXPENSE.
There have been rumors that the !
wants' Association and private j
v were financing the Grand Jury*. !
f.ut the fact is that the municipality j
la bearing the- cost, as it legitimately
should do for all such inquisitorial j
notwithstanding that the Board |
.^'-rvisors in its budget set aside
$1200 for the grand juries' cx
i ensee, allowing each inquisitorial body
during the year only $400.
But a secret conference with the Fin
1 ommittee of the Board of Super
visors and the "willingness of Presiding!
Judge Lawlor to make court orders for'
all the demands cleared away the ob- !
siacle that Foreman Andrews found in l
I Jip lack of funds with which to do en- i
c work. It was arranged with the :
â . c Committee that the general!
fund should be drawn upon and the I
niggardliness of the budget clrcum
* pnted. The Grand Jury bills are there
fore handled by the Auditor and Treas- '
urer as "miscellaneous court order de- '
mands."
The total expense account of the
former G-rand Jury, of which Alfred
Tyillenfeld was foreman, was about $300.
But Andrews and his colleagues will
bring the account into the thousands.
The rooms in the Mills building for the
of the members, almost all
of whom are in business near by, cost
165 a month. The furniture, carpets
and other furnishings have cost 5250.
Law books have beÂ«n purchased to the
c mount of $35.
That the Grand Jury is businesslike
la indicated by the bills that have been
paid by the City Treasurer. Newton J.
Tharp, architect, received $268 30 for
inspecting theaters in regard to com
| iance with fire ordinances during
January. He Is still at work. Two
f â¢ enographers, almost overwhelmed
work, get* $150 a month.
AYDREWS' BIG OUTLAYS.
Besides his January "personal ex
pense bill" for $373 46 Foreman An
drews collected a similar demand in
December for $34 16. The items are not
set forth at the Auditor's office, inas
much as they were of a secret charac
ter and Judge lÂ«awior was . the only
person to whom they might be revealed.
An idea of the exploits of grand
jurors In whizzing; automobiles and
ashing carriages may be gained from
the following demands that have been
audited: United Carriage Company,
*13; Mobile Carriage Company. $17 50;
Pioneer Auto Company, $5; Auto Liv
*>ry Company, $10; Black Hawk stables,
$7; United Carriage Company, $14 50; J.
"W. Murphy, livery, $4.
The sum of $6 50 was paid for the
keeping in a safety deposit box of the
M 330 that Sergeant Ellis surrendered as
bribery money paid for police protec
tion In Chinatown.
The Grand Jury's expense account is
now- near $2000, and according to Fore
man Andrews that body has just be
srun ts work. The Supervisors will
probably reflect the next . tin% before
limiting the expenditures of three
crand Juries during the year to $1200.
The presenT Invasion of. the general
fund Is likely to meet with protest from
Fome quarters, and it was for this'rea
son that such strict secrecy was main
tained.
The Grand Jury will this afternoon
investigate reports that in past years a
corruption fund has been raised to.in
fluence , legislation at Sacramento af
fecting the building and loan associa
tions.
Foreman ' Andrews was . Fubpenaed
yesterday to testify before the Police
'"oinmtesion to-night in the trial of Ser
goant Ellis. The foreman said he would ;
refuse to reveal more of ' 'â¢â  sergeant's â 
confession as to accepting' bribes than
was made public in i the. report of the
Grand Jury. j
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSES THE ESCH-TOWNSEND RAILROAD RATE
MEASURE BY A VOTE OF 326 TO 17.
DEMOCRATS VIE WITH REPUBLICANS
IN SUPPORTING PRESIDENT'S POLICY
/
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â After near- I
ly four days of discussion the House
to-day, by a vote of 326 to 17, passed the
Esch-Townsend bill providing for the
regulation of freight rates. The nega
tive vote was made up of eleven Re
publicans and six Democrats. The clos
ing hours of the debate were occupied
by Williams of Mississippi, the minor
ity leader, and Hepburn of lowa, chair
man of the committee which reported
the bill. Williams, while supporting
the minority measure even though, he
said, he knew it could not pass, com
plimented the Republicans for bringing
in a bill which was much better than
he expected would come from them.
The speech of Hepburn was rather in
defense of himself. He said his deeds
and acts were a sufficient answer to
the "lies and slanders" which had been
| heaped upon him. The Hepburn bill,
! he said, had been prepared by the At
torney General, and he yielded to his
colleagues on the Esch-Townsend bill
only because he did not want sensa
tional headlines to appear.
PIERCE OPENS THE DEBATE.
To-day's debate was opened by Pierce
of Tennessee, who, after announcing
that the President on the subject of
rate legislation was Â£he greatest leader
that has lived in the Republican ranks
since the Civil War, said he would sup
port the Esch-Townsend bill. He, how
ever, based his support upon the fact
that William J. Bryan and the Demo
cratic party had declared for just such
legislation.
De Armond of Missouri, while admit
ting the necessity for legislation, at
tacked the Esch-Townsend bill as be
ing an inadequate treatment of the
question. The bill, he said, was sin
gularly lacking in its compliance with
the recommendations of the President.
It did not reach private car lines, and
It was not to be supposed that the
courts would be eager and searching in
the endeavor to find in It something
on that subject which Its authors
themselves could not find.
The closing remarks for the minor
ity were made by Williams of Missis
sippi, who at the outset congratulated
the House upon the fact that not only
in the matter of rate legislation, but
in several other particulars. President
Roosevelt, "nominated by the Repub
lican party and elected by the people,"
was beginning to assume a distinctly
Democratic attitude. He said he had
begun to hope that the President would
recommend revision of the tariff and
that the President would see that it
was altogether absurd to keep 20,009
I more soldiers than were needed.
Addressing himself to the Republi
cans, Williams said they needed noth
ing more than a marking out of the
pathway to follow the President, not
' because he was President or a Repub
lican, but because he was outlining the
proper policy for the American people.
"Oh." he said, amid Democratic
laughter. "I know how non-partisan
you are."
PRAISE FOR THE PRESIDENT.
Williams said it might be true in
some things, as Grosvenor said yester
day, that the Democrats '"camped to
night where we camped last night,"
but he loudly proclaimed, facing the
Republican side, that on this question
"it is you who are camping this year
where the Democracy camped last
year."
If, he said, the majority in the House
did not follow the President's recom
mendations, it proved the necessity for
an automatic coupler between the
White House and the House of Repre
sentatives.
"A Republican Daniel is calling you,"
he exclaimed, "and he is at the other
end of the avenue and he is calling you
to do identically the same things that
you refused to do because it came out
of a Democratic Nazareth."
Discussing the merits of the bill, Wil
liams said the country had waited and
waited for the railroads themselves to
do it ju"stice. He agreed in part with
McCall of Massachusetts, who had said
the right to fix rates was a dangerous
power to confer on several men, but he

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1905.
argued that it was a choice between
two evils, as only -about seven great
railroad magnates, acting in connection
with one another, were directing the
stream of American commerce in the
channels they wished and discriminat
ing wherever they saw fit. If the fixing
of rates was to be lodged in some
hands, V* Uiams said, he preferred it to
I be a Gc.ernment tribunal, '"weak and
I ineffective as such tribunals are."
Declaring that he spoke as a conser
j vative, as he was not a radical, Wil
| Hams said the time may come when
I all the country except the South would
Ibe advocating Government ownership
lof railroads. The South never would
support that proposition, because it had
the old fashioned idea that the Govern
ment should not become too strongly
centralized. It was further opposed to
Government ownership because It knew
the Government would not operate
coaches for the whites and blacks.
REBUKES THE YEIzLOW PRESS.
Hepburn of lowa, chairman of the
Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce, closed for the Republicans.
He explained the difficulties of pre
paring such a measure as the bill re
ported, saying no two men entertained
the same opinion either as to what was
in the bill or as to what ought to be
in it.
Hepburn digressed for a moment and
received sympathetic applause from
bath Democrats and Republicans when
he asked to be excused for intruding a
matter of per- anal interest into the
proceedings, which was 4he first time
he had done so in eighteen years'
service.
"If I have been criticUed," he said,
with emotion, "I have borne it. I have
been slandered and lied about; I have
submitted to it, content that my deeds,
my acts, might be placed in opposition
to and answer to the libels of those who
traduced me."
The bill he drew, said Hepburn, he
regarded as but a rough draft, after
conferences with the President and
members of the Cabinet. He denied
that the Townsend bill was an admin
istration measure; nor, said he, was
any bill that he knew of an adminis
tration bill. As finally offered, he said,
that which was known as the Hepburn
bill was, with the exception of but two
words, the product of the brain of the
Attorney General. He had yielded,
however, to his colleagues on the com
mittee in the matter of the Esch-Town
send bill, not that he did not have con
fidence in his bill, but because he did
not want the committee "to be the tar
get for every scribbler who wanted
sensational headlines."
After commending the court-of
transportatlon feature of the bill. Hep
burn, in conclusion, urged the railroads
to a strict obedience of the law. They
must learn, he said, that there was a
power greater than they; that the in
terests of the multitude were greater
than the interests that could be sub
served by money and wrongdoing and
disobedience.
RESULT OF FINAL VOTE.
The bill of the minority was then dei
feated, Galnes of Tennessee, Rider and
Scudder of New York and Llvernash
and Wynn of California voting with
the Republicans.
The roll was then called on the Esch-
Townsend bill, which was passed â 326
to 17.

against the bill: Adams, Carter and
Dwfght of New York; Gardner of New
Jersey, Hill of Connecticut, Huff of
Pennsylvania, McCall of Massachu
setts, Porter of Pennsylvania, Slbley of
Pennsylvania, Southwlck of New York
and Vreeland of New York.
The following Democrats voted no:
Harrison of New York, McDermott of
New York, Rider of New York, Scudder
of New York, Goulden of New York
and Hull of Pennsylvania.

ELKINS REGISTRY BILL
FAVORED IN COMMITTEE
Names More Exacting Conditions for
Vessels Wrecked on the Ameri
can Coast.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â The Senate
Committee on Commerce to-day au
thorized a favorable report on the El
klns bill, providing for the amendment
of the laws admitting foreign built
vessels to American registry.
The bill provides that foreign vessels
wrecked on the American coast shall
not be admitted to American registry
unless repairs have been made in
American shipyards equal to three
fourths of the value of the vessel. The
present law requires that the repairs
made in American yards equal to two
thirds of the value of the vessel shall
admit the vessel to registry. The bill
further amends the laws by providing
that such vessels shall not be permit
ted to engage in coastwise trade.
Senator Elkins submitted* a report
showing that more than 700 such ves
sels had been admitted to American
registry under the present laws, and
that more than half that number had
been admitted within twenty years.
The bill, as reported to-day, was
amended so as not to apply to vessels
wrecked prior to the passage of the
bill.
PHILIPPINE SCOUTS
ENGAGED IS SAMAR
Fight With a Force of the Pnlajanes
Reported by General
Corbin. t
WASHINGTON, Feb. Â».â The fol
lowing cablegram has been received
at the War Department from General
Corbin at Manila:
Brigadier GÂ«neral William H. Carter reports
engagements of scouts with the Pulajanes at
Kan Jose, Samar, on February 2. Six guns
â were captured. There were no casualties. On
February S. Oustln. second lieutenant of the
Philippine Scouts, was wounded moderately;
one scout was killed and five wounded. A
thousand Pulajanes were located at Mount
Tiigro, dvÂ« east of Calbayog. Our forces co
operated with the native troops with good
effect. I have ordered an additional battalion
of infantry to Samar should their services be
required. The Governor Generrfl has been con
sulted and approves. We agree on the general
policy.
Laeey Indian Bill Favored.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9. â The House
Committee on Indian Affairs to-day
authorized a favorable report on the
Lacey bill, providing for the allotment
and distribution of Indian tribal

from time to time by the President,
depending on the advance in civiliza
tion of the Indians.
DUDLEY LIKELY TO BECOME
MINISTER TO VENEZUELA
San Diegan Regarded as Well Quail
fled to Deal With the Iras
cible Castro.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â Another ef
fort will be made by the United States
to untangle Its relations with Vene
zuela by taking a fresh' start with a
new Minister. It is probable that a few
, weeks will see a change In the lega
tion at Caracas. It is expected that
Bowen will come home and be pro
vided with another post and that he
â¢will be succeeded by Irving B. Dudley
of San Diego, Cal., now Minister of
the United States to Peru.
Dudley is regarded by the President
as possessing exactly those qualities
which he considers lacking in Bowen's
temperament. While the appointment
to Caracas is not a promotion for Dud
ley it will give him an opportunity to
accomplish an important work.

INSURANCE.
Fifty-Ninth Annual Report.-
OF THE
CONNECTICUT MUTUAL LIFE
INSURANCE COMPANY
To the Members:
The experience of The Connecticut j
Mutual in Its fifty-ninth year was satis- ;
factory and may be thus outlined': !
Sume Increase in the new business
written, in the amount of business in
force, in premium income. In interest |
and rents, in assets and in surplus; a
somewhat heavier mortality than in the j
preceding year, though still consider-
ably less than that expected, giving a i
saving of $252,823, with no outstanding ;
contested claims; a considerable de-
crease in the amount and cost of fore- j
closed real estate: a recovery In the j
market value of other securities of over ;
1576.000 as against the shrinkage of
about $770,000 in 1903; a reduction In the
ratio of expense to Income; a sound
condition throughout. The company i
continues in that steady, full tide of
beneficent operation which has for so ;
many years distinguished it among all !
others, by administrative methods j
which hold always one grand object In !
view: a maximum of result to Its bene- i
ficiarles at a minimum of cost to its
policy holders, each and all.
Ail details will be found In the flnan- â 
cial statement which accompanies this
report.
An Interesting Summary.
A summary of the operations of nf- 1
ty-nine years may be stated thus: Re- j
ceived from policy holders. $232,759,-
264.33; returned to policy holders and [
their beneficiaries, $234,353,488.98, or $1,-
594,224.65 more- than the amount re-
ceived from them; with assets in hand I
of $65,224,841.53, and a surplus of $4,828,- ,
696.64 with which to meet a liability, !
actual and contingent, o. $60,396,144.8Â» |
on $167,167,515.00 at risk on 70,454 poll- ;
cies. Except in the possible case of '
some society or concern with only a lo- |
cal and slight membership, no com-
parable results have been accomplished ;
by any other American life insurance
company.
Persistence of Business.
As for many years past, a most grati-
fying feature of our experience has !
been the persistence of our business. It '
has been no small factor In the com- 4
pany's prosperity. Business which goes |
off rapidly can be replaced rapidly only ;
: at an undue cost. Business which stays !
costs little, and permits the taking of I
! new business sufficient for a uniform !
good experience at such moderate cost j
as does not disturb the favorable aver- I
i age. That Is one ot the simple secrets
of The Connecticut Mutual's unequaled
success.
New Business: Its Character and Cost.
The new business of the year some-
what exceeded that of 1903, and also ex-
ceeded the amount of business ceasing, i
so that there waa some increase in the
amount in force. The new business was
selected with our usual constant care
to take only such risks as are likely to
! give the same favorable mortality ex-
perience which has been so large a fac-
tor in reducing the actual yearly cost \
of our insurance hitherto; and it has
been taken on the same low basis of
cost which has been directly reflected
in our large dividends to policy-holders
! throughout the company's lifetime.
To the faithful agents who in the
midst of a thoroughly demoralised com-
petition and despite the always
pressing temptation of much higher
commissions and allowances from oth-
ers choose to abide steadfast in our ser-
I vice because of its greater value to
I those whose neÂ«d they sincerely seek
I to serve, there is due alike from the
management and from the policy-hold-
ers benefited thereby the distinct and
constant recognition of the high, unself-
ish quality of their labors for the
: greater good of the whole membership.
Relation of Mortality to Xew Business.
The public is often given to under-
stand that as a large and rapid influx
of new business tends for a time to
keep down the average age of the busi-
ness as a whole and so to make the
death losses appear a smaller percent-
age of the whole amount at risk, it
really gives a comparatively better
mortality experience and therefore jus-
tifies Its abnormal cost. This is not
true. It belies the whole basis and
structure of life insurance. It is worth
a moment's examination:
Take 10,000 sound men aged 30, ln-
sured for $10,000 each, or $100,000,000 al-
j together. We know within safe limits
how many of these men will die each
year until all are gone; we charge each
one the premium adequate to meet that
rate of loss, and from the premiums
make the p iper reserves. The first year
only 84 will die, the company will pay
out $840,000, or only eighty-four one-
hundredths of 1 per cent of the amount
at risk; twenty years later there will
be 8180 of these men living, with $81,-
800,000 at risk; 124 of them will die that
year, the company will pay out $1,240,-
000, or 1% PÂ«r cent of the amount at
I risk; in the fortieth year 4418 will be
i living, with $44,180,000 at risk. 265 will
die, the company will pay out $2,650,000.
or about 6 per cent of the amount at
risk; in the fiftieth year there will be
1770 living:, with $17,700,000 at risk. 230
will die, the company will pay out $2,-
300,000, or 13 per cent of the amount at
risk; In the sixtieth year only 216 will
be living, with $2,160,000 at risk. 63 wljl
die, the company will pay out $630,000.
or about 30 per cent of the amount at
risk. But the mortality which In the
sixtieth year of the business calls for 30
per cent of the amount at risk is just as
normal and Just as favorable to the
company as that which In the first year
called for only eighty-four one-hun-
dredths of 1 per cent; and If the com-
pany has charged the proper premiums
and kept the proper reserves it is Just
as well prepared to pay the 30 per cent
as It was to pay the eighty-four one-
hundredths of 1 per cent: and If the
business was well selected and well lo-
cated the chances for a mortality more
favorable than that calculated for. with
a consequent saving on losses, have
been equally good all the way through.
No amount of forcing at whatever
cost can always keep the inflow of new
business greater than the outgo of the
j old. In the nature of things the day
will Inevitably come with any company
when its amount at risk must come to
a practical standstill and the age of its
business and the consequent ratio of its
death losses to the amount at risk
reach the maximum average. In that
day the greater the amount at risk and
the higher the cost at which It was ob-
tained, the greater will be the struggle
and the higher the cost of keeping: It at
even a standstill.
Securities.
The corporate securities held by us
are of the highest class. Their par
value is $25,361,070: the.y cost $25.-
685,116 and are worth In the market
$26,694,418. or $1,009,302 more than
their cost and $1.333,34S more than
their par value. The year 190S saw
an almost unprecedented shrinkage Â«in
the market value of such securities,
that upon our own holdings aggre-
gating $770,000. The past year has
seen a large recovery toward whal
may generally be regarded as an av-
erage normal valuation. Some of out
securities affected by the shrinkage

' Real ' Estate and Loans.
One of the most remarkable, as it-
was the/ most .unforeseen incident of
the - financial history.; of the last two
decades, has . been the changes* -
wrought in the conditions affecting the
values of city real estate, caused
mainly by the. development, of street
car service.. Before the advent of the
electric trolley living at a distance '
from business centers was difficult and
expensive. Population tended to
gather compactly . in their near pros- â 
imity, It spread only as it was forced*
outward by the spread of business.
This tended to both, increase and
steadiness ,in values and to ' certainty
in their realization. To-day the elec-
tric street car with its speed, its com-
fort and its accessibility, trie free mall
delivery and ,: the* telephone, have
largely reversed the conditions and
are leading the population to spread
out freely hi search of space, light,
air. more privacy and cheaper land.
The older settled parts or most of our
larger cities thus rind themselves In an
active competition which can be met
only by a reduction in prices which V
but a few years ago were jusUfledby
every - measurable ; condition then '] in
sight. For obvious reasons â  this great â¢
change has caused individual losses
which have led to many foreclosures
of : loans â  justifiably made under for-
mer conditions of higher and suppos-
edly stable values and the dullness of
the : real estate ' market, due in some
part to the continued operation of thÂ«
changes noted, have -in many cases'
compelled the lender 'to ' become ; the
owner of the : security.
â¢In all : this v experience _ this company '
has x had its share along with ethers.'
It now has foreclosed real estate which
cost it $8,678,593. This Is being gradu-
ally absorbed; some at a profit.* soraÂ«
at 'a ; loss.- Among our liabilities we V â â 
carry an Item for contingent deprecia-
tion of about $350,000. We intend to
make no unnecessary sacrifices. â¢ So far â¢
our profit and loss account on fore-
closed real estate as a whole is $1,368,-
943 to the good. . "
In our present more limited loans -
up%n this class of property we are tak-
ing such account of the conditions re-
ferred to as we believe will guard
against a future repetition of past ex-
periences.
" Notwithstanding the conditions which
have changed and unsettled real estate
values in many localities, and which
are still in progress, it may well be
that when they shall have become mar a
completely developed and their oper-
ations more fully defined and their in-
herent limitations better understood,
real estate, on the resultant basis of
values, may recover much of its former
favor, especially In view of the growing
difficulties in obtaining out of the great
flood of corporate securities those of a
thoroughly -conservative character and
for which the future demand is " likely
to be far greater than any possible sup-
ply. The funds asking thoroughly safe
investment, whether by savings banks,
insurance companies, trustees of insti-
tutions and estates, or private Individ-
uals, need to have available every form
of security that offers a stable basis of '
income and of ultimate value.
The Business Ideal of the Connect 1- :
cut Mutual.
Every business or enterprise under-
taken for a distinct and particular
service to the public, and which as-
sumes to offer men something they
truly need, . and something for which
those who need it should be willing to-
pay Its true and necessary cost, carries
within itself an ideal of method pecu-
liar and necessary to the purpose in- -
tended, appropriate and effective to ths
form of result intended and essential to
Its perfect realization. ._ , .
Especially is this true of mutual life
insurance. It takes note of the great
fact ; that he * who has . married , a wife ,"
and made her dependent on him,"; and
ought into the world helpless chil-
dren yet -more dependent, has assumed
toward them and toward society itself
a responsibility not only for their daily
bread, but for all the manifold needs *
of their whole dependent future% which
he " cannot shirk and - remain ': a true !
man; a responsibility which, In the
great majority of cases, it takes his
whole normal . lifetime rightly to dis-
charge, and one which his earlier de-
cease .: must leave unfulfilled, to /the ;
great loss and injury of his dependent
ones. . And . the ; risk, the danger of
this loss," rests upon them day by day .
and every day. In the great- majority ,
; of cases there is in hand no financial
[ provision fully adequate and available
,to "replace for all their future that
! which his family would lose in his '
[ death. There is but one way In which
that provision can be made at once
I and kept always ready and secure. Ha
I must insure his life for the benefit of
those who will lose by its loss. In no .
I otherwise can his responsbility be ful-
j filled for their whole future, which la
\a? much his. to. pro vide for as is their
1 present. â¢-
And it is this which we ; offer to da
for him. for them ; to ' take his money
while he lives, and, -to the ' fullest : ex- '
i tent that money, much â¢or little, en- ,
ables us, to provide for them when hÂ»
is gone. ; It â is a sober â¢ undertaking; it
is his duty; it is our trust. And be- Â
i cause it is his duty, and a transaction '
! whose benefit goes to others but whow <
burden falls on him ' and in : order that â .
the , benefit ' may %. be as : great .' as : pos- '
sible to those who need it, and that
, in proportion to the 'benefit given the
I burden on him 1 may be as small as
! possible, we offer to do the business on
the " mutual plan; to t make ,no . profit
out -ofi it ; for stockholders.' but to
charge him a premium which. Is cer-
tain to be ' adequate,' 1 and then, ' year by .
year, sby ! careful selection of risks, by '
; proper . Investment of reserves, and -by
{ economy in expenses, to save as much,
i of. . that . premium as possible and re-
turn It 'to him, year by year, so that
each year he gets his insurance at its
1 actual yearly cost to the company.
And the full meaning of mutuality is. '
that what the plan does for one it does
equally for each one. It does not set up
a _ scheme Aof deferred ? dividends for 'â â 
twenty years, * make . each man pay his
full -; premium each year regardless of
what the actual cost has been for the
year, 'make him leave with the com- -
pany each year's surplus from his pre-
miums," ato be forfeited if he dies of
lapses, and to be \ finally divided up by
the one-thirdâ for â of those
who survive .and pay throughout the
term; a speculation by each one in
v what " he _, hopes he - may not ; lose. , but
some one else will; a pool to which all â¢
contribute* but 'â  which a few only will
divide; ;a" gamble as to who those few
shall- be. " True mutuality in life Â» insur-
ance ''does' not thus seek to favor a few '
at the expense of the manyâ to â  give :
the % few what . the many ; have lost. It
i I charges each man a - premium propor-
tioned to his risk, and so charges every
man > alike.' It '- ascertains *â  each year "
each man's like proportion of the actual
cost of the whole year's operation, and.
returning to each man what he has
paid in > excess of his due part. of that
cost, gives to every policy-holder alike
' his ? Insurance 'at j its ' actual cost, t with
â¢ ; no discrimination jin favor of any on*,
( with no .hardship : upon any Â«one. Each
pays his own actual cost: each gen
' hack his own contribution to the sur-
'. plus created by all alike.
That Is the ideal purpose. and 'that is
the ' ideal methodâ the â¢ actual "square
deal" â of mutual life insurance.
' How truly and " steadfastly The Con-
'â â  ' necticut Mutual has held to, these ideals

A healthy appetite and common sense
are excellent guides to follow in mat-

STRIKERS COLLECT PAY.
Novel Feature of the Labor Disturb
ance at Lodz.
LODZ. Poland, Feb. 9.â At the thread
mills and other establishments the
strikers were to-day paid three days'
wages- as an advance, although it was
claimed that nothing was legally due
them.
The managers of Helnzetel's mills
refused to pay anything and the work
men threatened to wreck the place. The
military prepared to fire and for a mo
ment the situation was extremely
grave, but the management yielded and
agreed to pay, provided the men would
return to work on Monday. Another
manager refused payment to the strik
ers, but at the point of a revolver was
compelled to promise payment to-mor
row. Employers are paying only as, a
method of expediency.
There were serious disturbances to
day at Pabiance. Troops fired upon
the workmen, killing one and wounding
two.
Socialists Denounce Butcheries.
BERLJX, Feb. 9. â Socialists held
twenty-one monster meetings In Ber
lin and its suburbs to-night to ex
press "flaming indignation at the
butcheries and massacres which the
Russian Government has performed on
defenseless men, women and children
in St. Petersburg." Sharply worded
resolutions were passed. The meet
ings were addressed by Herr Bebel
and other leading Socialistic members
of the Reichstag.
PEACE MOVEMENT REVIVED.
Inter-Parliamentary Fnlon Urges
President to Take Action.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9. â President
Roosevelt was urged to-day to take
action looking to the termination of
the Russo-Japanese war. The request
was made by the Inter-Parliamentary
Union, through the' president of the
organization, Representative Bar
tholdt of Missouri. The President
gave Dr. Bartholdt no definite assur
ance beyond promising to consider the
matter with Secretary Hay. It is
known to be quite unlikely that this
Government will take any action look
ing to mediation until some assur
ances have been received from either
party to the pending conflict that
such action would not be unwelcome.
ROME, Feb. 9.â ln the Chamber of |
Deputies to-day Signor Socci (Repub- j
lican) said: *
It Is now a year sine* hoetllitie* between
Japan and Russia began. In the namt of
humanity and the brotherhood of peoples I
express the wish that the butchery should
.cease. At the came time I hope that ; the Rus
sian people may reach the accomplishment of
their deeire for liberty and call attention to the
fact the day I so express myself Is the an
niversary of the foundation of the Roman
republic.
The President of the chamber eaid
he did not consider this was an oppor
tune moment for Signor Socci's state
ment, but he was sure all the Depu
ties, without distinction of party,
would join him in his wishes and
hopes.
The President's statement was
gTeeted with much applause from the
Deputies and also from those occupy
ing the tribunes.
BERLIN. Feb. 9. â An official of
the Foreign Office here, referring to
the statements in the French and Brit
ish press on the subject of the pos
sibility of peace in the Far East, said

STRENGTH OF THE ARMIES.
KuropatkJn Has 50,000 More Men
Than Oyama.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 9.â The
army organ publishes official statis
tics of Field Marshal Oyama's forces,
based on the regimental numbers on
the uniforms of the Japanese killed
during the engagements with General
Kuropatkin's forces. According to the
report, General Kuroki, commanding
the Japanese right, has 76 battalions,
11 squadrons and $06 gunsâ about 85,000
men, besides 70 to 80 reserve battalions.
General Nodzu, commanding the cen- i
ter, has 60 battalions, 6 squadrons and i
198 guns, or 65.000 men. General Oku, j
commanding the left, including General i
Nogi's forces, has 93 battalions, 22
squadrons and 342 guns, or 110,000 men. i
The number of reservists with Gener- ,
alp Nodzu and Oku is unknown. '
The total of Field Marshal Oyama's
regular trpops is placed at 265,000 cav
alry and Infantry and 850 guns. The
total number o* reservists is probably
100.000. Military men estimate General
Kuropatkin's superiority at about
50,000 men. without Including the six
teenth army corps, which is not -yet
in the Far East.

DIJXSMTJIR WILL HEARIXG
COMES TO CONCLUSION
Commission Finishes Its Labors and
the British lawyers Lieave
for Canada.
The local proceedings in the Duns
muir will contest, which have been in
progress before a commission for the
past month in the British Consul's of
fice, were brought to a close yesterday
afternoon with- the introduction of two
new witnesses by the defense. The
evidence accumulated will be carried
to British Columbia for the use of the
court there in deciding whether to sus
tain or break the will.
Both sides in the contest are con
fidently claiming the victory. Yester
day's proceedings included the finish
ing of T. 53. K. Cormac's testimony on
probate law. ' Walter Gompera and
"Willliam Mighell testified to the con
versation had with Lowe, a wittnesa
to the will. The question now remains
for the British, court to decide, the
Canadian delegation departing last
night with the records of the proceed
ings.
One of the myeterlea of finance that -will
â¢urely strike the uninitiated in such matters la
contained In the report of the Connecticut Mu
tual Life Insurance Company published in an
other column. Receiving from its policy hold
era in the fifty-nine years it has oonducted
business $232,759,264, it has yet been able to
pay back to them or their beneficiaries $234,
358,488. thus giving them In round numbers
$1,600,000 more than it has taken from them;
it has also been able to accumulate assets of
over $65,000,000 for future and contingent lia
bilities, and a surplus of but little less than
$r.,000,000 as well. This is a record that is
absolutely without an equal In all the history
of life insurance and speaks volumes for that
conservative management of the company that
has continued for more than a half century
with marked benefit to the policy holders and
to them alone. The ratio of management to
expenses fell a trifle under 12 per cent last
year in spite of the sharp competition for new
business â an item that strongly favors dividend
disbursements to policy holders, as does also
thfc further fact that the surplus has not been
allowed to accumulate beyond the sum that
brings assurance of absolute safety to all con
cerned, even should some dire calamity befall
the country and sweep away scores or hundreds
of what are known as "the best risks." The
report 1* "meaty." as are all of Celonel
Greene's, and will well repay not only read

"PEARL FISHERS"
COULD WELL BE
HEARD OFTENER
There is no reason but Calve'a why
one should not hear oftener "The Pearl
Fishers." the Bizet opera that was
given at the *Tivoll for the first time
last night, though the first two acts
oÂ£ the opera were given In New York
some years ago with Calve as Leila,
The third, it was said, was cut because
the barytone comes in triumphant at
the finish, Mr. Bizet compelling the
hero and heroine to make a hasty exit
some forty measures before the curtain
and Calve did not believe In a curtain
without Calve! Still there might be
other reasons. The legend goes that
the opera was finished by a student of
Bizet's, and there is some inherent
evidence to the effect in the compara
tive weakness of the last act There
is no danger, quite charming as it is,
that "The Pearl Fishers" will ever de
throne "Carmen." Its date is ten years
earlier, "Carmen" is all of that better
Bizet. But the opera is distinctly pleas
ing. It has the same characteristic
quality in such brilliant evidence in
"Carmen." There is distinct and suc
cessful feeling for the Hindoo color,
obtained both through characteristic
themes and ingenious instrumentation.
And the opera is eminently , tuneful,
tuneful in the frank old way, yet with
a leaning to the modern operatic
school. There is in the first act a duet
between barytone and tenor of quite
extraordinary beauty; the Boprano gets
a delightful solo in the second act,
where is also a very taking duet for
tenor and soprano; and the choruses
loom up most honorably in the score.
The story of the opera has already
been told, that of the Indian maid, con
secrated to the gods, who dares to love
a mere man. She is a sort of hostage
to the gods for the safety of the fishers
for pearls, and for her sin is according
ly doomed to die. The nffalr is compli-*
eated by the lady being loved by two
men, who, as she has been chosen for
the service of the gods, promise each
other never to see her more. It is this
vow out of which Bizet has made the
aforesaid duet for barytone and tenor.
The scene, in Ceylon, by palm if not
pine, adds much to the picturÂ«squeness.
Tetrazzini was the Leila last night, in
a lively all-over tan complexion. It
was much more becoming, by the way,
than the dead white French makeups
she commonly affects. Tetrazzini is
happier when she is sadder. Mad, as
Lucia, in the trillful lark-like fashion
of the Lammermoor bride, she is at
her best. Her Traviata is another tear
ful triumph, and her Gilda. Leila is
really the heroine of an opera comique,
and escapes comfortably with her lover
in the last act. The circumstances are
less stressful throughout, though the
music is more dramatic in treatment
than in any of the afoTesaid roles,
taken altogether. It suits Tetrazzini
therefore less well. She charmed,
however, as she always does, and was
besieged with flowers after her big bolo,
that she repeated. Bazelli wai the Na
dir, the lover, and both picturesquely
and musically effective. Bazelli im
proves with each hearing. It would
seem that he was In bad form on hfe
debut here. Last night he sang even
exquisitely at times, the fine lyric value
of his voice expressing admirably his
charming lyric sense. La Puma as
Zurga, the friend of Nadir, came in
with telling usefulness. Siffnor Cervi
was a good High Priest, and the chorus
did nobly.
The leader was Golisclani, and the
directing was modest, precise and sym
pathetic.

BULLETS ARE INTRODUCED IN EVIDENCE
MAY FIND BODY
OF PAUL JONES
Embassador Porter Has Clew
to Location of Grave in
Paris of the Naval Hero
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9âEmbassa
dor Porter has some reason to believe
that he has at last discovered the re
mains Of John Paul Jones. About
four years ago he secured a clew which
indicated that the remains of John
Paul Jnnes. who died in Paris, had been
ir.ttrred in a small urban cemetery;
but a search for this cemetery distlos
ed the fact . that- it had been aban
doned early" in the . last â¢ century, and
that its site was : covered with build
toss. , â¢ v^,-;-; : â¢
Not long jgo Porter came into -.pos
session of some additional information,
which warranted at least the hope that
the remains had not been .removed â¢
when the buildings were erected, and
that the body reposes . beneath the
foundations or within the cellar of one
of the dilapidated flats which stand on
the ground once occupied by the ceme
tery, if these clews ! are to be . fol
lowed it will be necessary to raze any
where from four to a. dozen buildings. !
It has been, suggested that if the re
mains be found it would riot be pos
sible to identify = them after this lapse
Â«>f time* as those of John Paul' Jones.
Porter, however, thinks otherwise, ,
pointing 'â  out that the American, sailor
was buried in a. lead coffin â very un
usual means of interment. at that time
and one- likely to preserve the body in
fair condition for an indefinite period.
It is true that Jones, by bequeathing
to friends and immediate attendants i
upon his deathbed his sword, his mcd- !
als and jewelry, which otherwise would
have been found in his coffin, has add
c-d to the difficulty of identiiication, but
Porter feels that the hermetically seal
â¢aicafllnj if found, will still contain suf
licient evidence of the identity ;of its
oi-cupant. : .
The Kmbassador has suggested to
the President that to defray the cost
of searching for the remains Congress
bo asked to appropriate a fund of
$05,000, and the President, it is believed,
will approve this recommendation. 1 :.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN. Feb. 9.â The main interest
in the case of Adolph Weber, accused
of the murder of his mother. Mary
Weber, was centered to-day on the
testimony of Howard Carr,** an expert
gunsmith. Carr gave expert testimony
concerning the bullets fired frc-m the
revolver found in the Weber barn. This
testimony is thought by the prosecu
tion to be a very important link in the
chain of testimony connecting the
weapon with the bloody tragedy of
November I<>. Th' revolver found in the
Weber barn was introduced as evidence
during the morning session. It is still
blood stained, but the two hairs sup
posed to be from the head <rt Earl
vvebtr that v. ere attached to the weap
on when it was found have disap
peared.
When the weapon was brought into
court Adolph Welter was reading the
newspapers. Whether he knew the re
volver was being introduced into evi
dence no one knows, but at any rate
he continued reading while the exhibit
was being passed around the court. He
did not take his eyes from the paper
until Attorney Johnson asked for the
weapon. Then ihe prisoner dropped his
paper, and leaning over the shoulder
of Attorney Johnson took a long look at
the weapon.
("larcnce Geear was recalled. He
gave- a realistic and vivid description
of how he carried the bodies of Bertha
Weber and Mary Weber from the burn
ing building. Attorney Hamilton acted
&s a dummy and Geear placing his
hands beneath the arms of the attorney
showed how he had dragged the body
oi Mary Weber off the porch of the
blazing Weber residence down the front
tteps to the lawn, where he laid the
body upon the grass. He said the gar
ments coveiing the tower part of Mrs.
Webers bedy were entirely destroyed
by flames ;'nd her limbs badly burned.
Geear described hc-w Mrs. Sno\vdcn,
the sister of the murdered woman, who
was but a few feet away, was crying in
piteous tones to be allowed to go to, her
sistc-r's side, but was held back by
friends. H<* also described how the
bodies of Uertha: Weber and little Earl
Weber came out from the burning
building.
BODY IS ABLAZK.
"Flames broke out on the body of
| Bertha Weber." said the witness, "as it
was dragged into the air. Guy Lukc-ns
and George Ruth put the flames out by
beating them with their hats. Bertha
i was horribly burned about the face, j
1 She was hardly recognizable." Contin- |
; uing, Geear related how he carried Earl j
down the steps to Sheriff W. I. May, â 
who look the little fellow in his arms j
and placed him in a big easy chair. ;
"The morning following the terrible j
; tragedy, in company with Adolph Web
; er and Adrian Wills. I went up to the J
j ruined Weber home," said Geear* j
i "Adolph remained at the gate while j
; Wills and I went to the back part of I
i the house, where we discovered the
charred remains of Julius Weber. He
was lying 6n the floor of the bathroom.
The body was burned almost to a j
crisp."
Geear then gave a history of the find
ing of the revolver in the Weber barn.
He said he went to search for the
weapon on account of the reward that I
i was offered.
At this time the revolver was brought !
into court by Sheriff Keena. It was of
fered in evidence by the prosecution.
Attorney Johnson objected to the intro
duction of the weapon as evidence, but
I Judge Prewett overruled the objection.
Detective C. H. Reimer testified re
â¢ g at ding the finding of the weapon. He
THE SAN FRANCISCO . CALL. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 10. ldOo.
i said he had gone to the Weber barn
j with Frank Dependener and was on the
outside when suddenly he heard Clar
ence Geear call to him that he had
i found, a revolver under the barn. When
j asked by Attorney General Webb if
the weapon was just as it was the day
I it was found. Reimer replied:
i "Xo. there was much more blood
I upon it at that time and there were
j also two light colored hairs on the
j weapon. That was the condition of
the pistol when 1 handed it to the
I District Attorney. Tlip District Attor-
I uy handed it to Tabor, one of the
I attorneys for the defense who was
: present at that time, and Tabor began
Ito examine it. He put It under his
: arm, evidently with the idea of break
j inp it, and as he did so some one
I said, 'Be careful with it and don't
deface it.' When Tabor pulled the
pistoi from under his arm it bore a
different appearance. The hairs were
! gone and some of the blood was wiped
i off."
Attorney Johnson took th? witness
in hand for cross-examination. He
s;(id. "Who i? employing you in this
"I sm employed by the Sher
iff,' said Reimer. Johnson then ask
| ed, "Who do you expect will pay you
| for your services?"
The witness declined to answer this
I question.
"I ask this question because I un
derstand you are employed hm some
witnesses who are to be called in this
case," said Johnson.
"I am not," ratorted the detective.
'Then who is going i o pay you?"
asked Johnson.
â¢I decline to ansv.er." said Reimer.
Later in the afternoon when Rei
mer was again billed to the stand he
stated ho had refused to answer the
question because of a rule of the de
tective company he represented.
HIRED BY SHERIFF.
"The rule of our company," he said,
"is never to divulge the rmrnc- of a
client, but in this case, as my clients.
Sheriff Keena and District Attorney
Robinson, are willing that I shall give
their names, I now do so. I look to
them for my pay."
Howard Carr, the gunsmith, said
ho had been making a study of guns
for the United States Government for
many years. "Last night," said Carr,
1 took the revojver found in the
Weber barn and experimented with* it
in the District Attorney's office. I
â  fired two shots with it. Here are the
two bullets used. The marks on these
two bullets are-aimi4ar to those on the
i bullets found In the bodies of the
! Webers. .These marks were caused
I by rust In the barrel of the revolver."
Oarr added that In his experiments
; he rire*d at a target made of a great
i wad of soft cotton, so that the bullets
j when recovered would present exact-
I .y th<* same appearance as w.hen they
j left 'the. muzzle of the weapon.
Attorney Johnson objected strenu
; ously to the introduction of this expert
| testimony and quoted authorities upon
1 the subject. After an hour's discussion
Judge Prewett decided that the testi
mony of Carr should not be admitted
as expert testimony, but that the bul-
I lets found in the bodies of the Webers
and those with which Carr had experi
mented should be allowed to figure in
the case and .would be presented to the
jury later on.
LAST TO SEE WEBERS.
Other witnesses who testified to-daj
were Miss Edna Fulton, Judge E. O
Smith, J. A. Piedom and Nana Clay
born, a colored woman. The last namec
tfcstifie'l that she rushed up to the scene
b! the fire on Nr>vember 10, saw the

000 acres of land in Western Wyoming
will pass into the hands of Utah sheep
raisers. The deal is in the form of a
lease from the Union â  Pacific to the
Uintah Grazing Association, whu-h
owns large flocks of sheep in Wyoming
and Utah. John C. Mackay, bounty
Commissioner, and E. 11. Cal lister, rev
enue co-Uector at Salt Lake, signed the
lease on behalf of the association.
The tease is one of the largest drawn '
up for some time. It involves alternate
sections of government lands. The
tract lies in what is known as the Red '
Desert between Leroy and the Green
River, the grazing lands being among
the best that the West affords. It will
furnish winter grazing for 300,000 head
of fheep owned by several parties, each
of whom possesses a summer and fall
ranare of his own. Under the laws of
Wyoming the tract can be kept free
from transient grazers without being
fenced.
It will also save the members of the
association from overcrowding, as
they can regulate the number of sheep j
that the range wili accommodate.

PASSEVGER ROBBED WHFLE
ASLEEP OX A STEAMER
;A. S. Calder, Ffcrnier From Denver,
Obtains Assistance of Police, but
Coin Is Not Found.
A telephone message was received
lat police headquarters early yester
day morning that a passenger had
been robbed of $385 on the steamer
Francis H. Leggett from Los Angeles.
Detectives Reynolds and Coleman,
who were on night duty, hurried to
| the steamer. They were informed by
I A. S. Calder, a farmer from Denver,
' that he had put 1386 in his vest pock
| et, placing the vest under the mattress
j in his bunk when he and his wife re
tired. When he awoke just before
the arrival of the steamer he found
the vest under the mattres,s, but the
i money had disappeared.
Calder made his loss known to the
captain, who gave orders for the pas
sengers to remain aboard till the po
lice arrived. This order caused the
greatest excitement. When the de
tectives arrived Calder told them he
suspected a young man, who indig
nantly denied knowing anything about
the money and insisted upon being
searched. Against the protests of
other passengers Calder demanded
that the detectives search their grips.
This was done, but without result.
The detectives cannot understand
how the money could have been stolen
from the vest without the thief awak
ening either Calder or hie wife. Cal
der is a heavy man and lay on top of
the vest. Calder and his wife had
been on a visit to Los Angeles and in
tended going to Portland from here.
The loss of his money may alter his
plans.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY W. 1905.
TELLS STORY
OF BIG DEAL
Some One Let Slip Informa
tion That Kay Cost Leroy
G. Harvey His Commission
$35,000 IS AT STAKE
F. J. Woodward Says He Got
the Double Cross in the
Purchase of Sather Tract
Oakland Office San FranciÃco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 9.
How it was that Leroy G. Harvey
[ stood to make a $35, C00 commission on
: the sale of the Sather Tract for $250,
1 000 to F. J. Woodward, F. C. Havens
and F. M. Smith and this information
was conveyed to the persons most in
terested in knowing about it is at pres
ent the subject of a suit in the courts
and the true inwardness of the deal will
not be known until the testimony of
j all the parties to the transaction is
given on the witness stand.
The answer of W-. H. Chickering as
one erf the parties was filed with the
! County Clerk to-day. He says that the
sale, of the land was effected between
Mrs. Josephine Bruguiere, the owner
of the property, and F. J. Woodward
as the agent of F. M. Smith and F. C.
Havens by Leroy G. Harvey. The
money was paid to Chickering as at
torney for Mrs. Bruguiere and she in
structed him to give Harvey $35,000 out
of the $250,000 and place the remaining
$215,000 to her credit. Prior to the sale
she had signed a contract with Wood
ward to sell him the property for
$250,000.
Before Chickering had paid Harvey
the money, in some way Woodward
became aware of the facts of the case
and ordered Chickering to hold the
money as Harvey was acting as his
agent and he was entitled to the $35,000.
Mrs. Bruguiere has begun a suit for
the money. Harvey has directed Chick
ering to hold on to the money until the
ccrurta decide to whom it belongs.
Woodward says that he employed Har
vey under an agreement whereby he
was to pay him $2500 if he put the deal
through and that he paid him $1000
when the contract was signed, the un
derstanding being that he would get it
for the least sum possible. How the
information got to Woodward that
spoiled Harvey's deal may come out at
the trial of the case.
PROFESSOR CALLS BILL
"QUEER SORT OF MEASURE"
Head of University's Agricultural De
partment Expresses Opinion of
Proposed Legislation.
BERKELEY, Feb. 9. â Professor E.
W. Hilgard, dean of the agricultural
department of the university, to-day
received from Sacramento copies of a
bill, numbered 425, introduced by
Senator Emmons, one of the quartet
accused of accepting bribes. The bill
amazed Professor Hilgard and he
promptly styled it a '"freak measure."
He will begin an investigation to
learn, if possible, the object of those
who are supporting it.
The bill referred to is merely a
copy of the fertilizer control bill
adopted in 1903, retaining the features
that were objected to at that time and
later removed.
One of those objectionable features
was a provision requiring those who
handled fertilizers to ascertain and
certify that no contagious diseases
had existed in fields from which the
fertilizing base was secured.
"This would have worked a hard
ship on fertilizing men, who could not,
for example, make any such investiga
tion in foreign countries," said Profes
sor Hilgard to-day, "and so it was
stricken out, yet I see that it, with
other objectionable clauses, is in this
bill No. 425. The bill even contains
the clause appropriating $1800 for a
fertilizer tenting laboratory, which
money has been used to build the lab
oratory we now have. There must be
something .wrong with the bill and
we propose to investigate it."

Dress and the Races Cause Downfall
of Miss Agnes Grotheer.
OAKLAND, Feb. 9.â Miss Agnes
Grotheer, for six years cashier
for the M. J. Keller Company,
Washington street, near Thirteenth,
has been discharged from that position,
and the little cottage at 1328 Kirkhara
street, which her aged father and
mother toiled to own, has passed into
the hands of W. A. Houts, a member
of the Keller Company, to settle a dis
crepancy of $2100 in the young woman's
books.
The discrepancies, M. J. Keller says,
were uncovered within a short time.
Simultaneously with the sudden re
moval of- Miss Grttheer private detec
tives were employed to watch the
young woman, that pending an adjust
ment of the financial differences her
movements might be kept track of and
possible flight prevented.
Arrangements satisfactory to the
company were not made until Tuesday
night, when Frederick and Catherine S.
Grotheer, the girl's parents, deeded
their home to Houts, the document go
ing on record to-day. The transfer
shows on the face of it a nominal con
sideration of $10, but the figures $2100,
which were originally written on the
paper, show despite an attempt to
erase them.
Keller was anxious to shield his
former cashier from the taint of wrong
doing, although he admitted that the
transfer of the property spoke for itself.
He declared that to-day with the pass
ing of the deed any amount that might
have been due his house from Miss
Grotheer had been paid.
The Grotheers denied, not only that
Mlsb Grotheer had been using her em- j
ployers' money, but likewise were era- :
phatic that the property had not been
transferred, this in face of the recorded

mapped out a plan for the musical enlighten
ment of the general public that promises to
be a rarely pleasant form of education. Be
ginning with Tuesday evening, February 21, a
series of musically illustrated lectures will be
given in the fine auditorium of the Christian
Church in Berkeley and will follow in weekly
succession until April 11, Inclusive. W. J.
McCoy, whose thoroughness as a musician Is
too well known to need comment, will be the
lecturer each evening, and Mrs. Fred Outter
son will preside at the piano.
On the list of capable artists on various In
struments who will play are the names of
Fred Gutterson, cellist: Mr. Burrls, the flute
player who Is doing such exquisite work at
the Tivoll; J. L. Mundwyler, with oboe, and
Herr Schott. the finest French horn player on
the coast. Some of the compositions that are
to be explained and Illustrated are the sonata
In A minor for flute, by Handel; the fantasie
jstuecke op. 73, by (Schumann, for clarionet;
sonata for French horn by Richard Strauss:
aome Hebrew melodies for the viola by Max
Bruch, and a maerchen lleder for oboe by
Schumann. A rare treat. Indeed, are these
good people of the Home Music Club prepar
ing for their patrons and no doubt many Oak
landers will take advantage of an opportunity
that has never been given them before.
Mrs. J. H. "Wood, Mrs. W. R. Pond and

deed. On the part of the girl. Kellers
explanation was at the outset that the
discharge had taken place on grounds
of economy. This he supplemented by
saying:
So far as this thins is concerned 1 cannot
say what period of time It covÂ«rs. There Â»erÂ«
differences In tiie accounts that led to some
Investigation. Miss Grotheer wax dismissed
and the matter has been adjusted. Srn had
been with us for six years as cashier.
Concerning; the rumors that a young man
was interested in her, I am not prepared to
talk. She had been keeping company for six
or eight months with Frank Oates, who was
in our employ for a few months. He seemed
to be a respectable man of good manners and
habits. I cannot connect him with any mat
ters concerning my business dealings with
Miss Grotheer.
It was said that for some time before
Miss Grotheer's discharge she had been
in the habit of dressing in a style be
yond her income; that she had been
given to gambling on the horse races,
and had otherwise found extraordinary
ways of spending money which over
taxed her salary. To these allegations
Miss Grotheer made positive denial,
though In the same breath she insisted
no deed of her parents' home had been
made to her former employers.
Surveillance of the young woman by
private detectives was so close that
Miss Grotheer was kept in sight for a
week. It was understood that her lib
erty would be in jeopardy unless her
difficulties with the M. J. Keller Com
pany were arranged by Tuesday night.
The detectives were warned to prevent
Miss Grotheer from buying a railroad
ticket for any point outside of Oakland.
The Grotheer residence was under
guard for a week.
Miss Grotheer is 22 years old. tall and
slender. Her father is a deckhand in
the Southern Pacific Company's em
ploy. She has a brother who is a freight
train conductor with that company.

Tells a Tale of Disaster
COMPANION LEAVES HER
Fred Trosch, She Says. Took
Mosey She Drew From
Bank and Left Her Alone
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street, Feb. 9.
Mrs. Lizette Werren, the 60-year-old
wife of Christopher Werren, who eloped
on January 22 with Fred Trosch, a man
thirty years her junior, returned to i
her husband's home last night, plead
ing to be reinstated. She related a story
of disaster in connection with her weird
romance, that culminated when Trosch
took most of her money and deserted
her while they rode together in Oregon
on their way to Tacoma.
Mrs. Werren is a portly Swiss woman, !
remarkably well preserved, who for . ,
many years has assisted her husband â¢
in operating a picturesque little resort
in the North Berkeley hills. Trosch, a
carpenter, was a boarder in their home. ,
He persuaded Mrs. Werren that life ; i
with him in a home he would build in ;
the nortH would be preferable to com- '
panionahfp with Werren. who is 8Â« ,
years old. Trosch promised to provide :
Mrs. Werren with all that her heart i
could wish if she would but draw the ;
joint savings of herself and husband
from the bank and flee with him.
Mrs. Werren consented, and added to
the unusual # character of the proceeding !
by choosing the night of her thirty- '
fourth wedding anniversary as the time (
for the elopement. The Werrens had l
invited a lot of friends to celebrate the | j
anniversary of their marriage on Janu- )
ary 22, and these came to the Werren :
1 household at the time appointed, only <
to be told that Mrs. Werren and Trosch ;
had disappeared. The aged husband *
suspected that they had gone together. âº \
When he visited the t'nion Savings .
Bank of Oakland the day after and \
found his wife had drawn $1000, banked j
in their joint names and representing
nearly all the savings of a lifetime. ]
Werren was convinced of his wife's [
guilt. He made no attempt to find the
couple. I l
Last night Mrs. Werren, haggard and ; ,
in distress, came back. She reported j ,
that Trosch had basely deceived her, ; ]
deserted her and taken with him $600, [
nearly all that was left of the $1000. I J
She declared that Trosch stole the ! ]
money from her as she slept in the car j
and left her at Oregon City. Their J
tickets were for Tacoma. She had paid j ;
for them. 3
Mrs. Werren went on to Tacoma and j
got rooms in a lodging-house. That ! \
night a cyclone struck Tacoma and the ; 5
hotel burned down. Mrs. Werren's ! i
clothes were all destroyed, and she cut i i
her feet on broken glass while escap- j (
ing from the burning building. Shelter : j
with some Swiss countrymen was found ' i
for her. and she was nursed there for ! 1
two weeks. She spent most of what i T
money she had left for doctors' bills i i
and new clothes, and then decided to j
come back and ask to be forgiven. Mr. J
Werren refused to admit her last night, j s
and the woman went to the home of t
Postmaster George Schmidt, who is ) ]
Werren's landlord. Mr. Schmidt inter- j (
ceded for the aged woman and she was . Â«
permitted to remain in Werren's home j i
to-day. I
Werren says she may have shelter j j
there, and that as soon as possible he a
will secure a divorce. He alleges that ]
this is the second time she has left him i
for a younger and handsomer man.
the first offense occurring fifteen years ( (
ago in Oakland, when one Peter Wat- j
tell was the object of Mrs. Werren's <
wayward affections.

OAKLAND, Feb. 9. â Owing to a
demand for a jury trial in the suit
brought by J. A. Kingore-Jones of
Berkeley against the Continental

trustee for the Continental Building

it is security for an indebtedness of
$5342 40.

LAURA BRIDE POWERS
LOS ANGELES, Feb. Â».â The fourth
convention of the California Federation
of Women's Clubs came to a close to
night. More things have happened
than were down on the programme,
particularly the routing of the southern
delegations by the hosts from the
north. All day disappointed groups of
southern women gathered In the lob
bies bemoaning the loss of amendments
upon which they have been caucusing
for days. However, the unanimous
election of their candidate for presi
dent, Mrs. Joslah Evans Cowles. has,
in small measure, softened the blow.
The morning was given up to reso
lutions bearing upon every debatable
subject under the sun. Including the
Sraoot question, the admission of wo
men physicians to State insane hos
pitals, the establishment of a State
hospital for tuberculosis patients, the
establishment of a "Bird Day" and in

AGED ARTIST
PASSES AWAY
IN GERMANY
BERLIN, Feb. 9.â Adolph yon Men
zel, the artist, died to-day. He was 90
years of age. His death was due to
weakness superinduced by a severe
cold.
Menzel had been identified with the
best in German art for sixty years and
had been treated by this generation
with that reverence and respect which
Germans love to show to their old men.
His quaint figure, about 5 feet tall,
with hat, cravat and dress suggesting
the fifties, was known to most of the
people in Bertin, for he was often in
the streets walking for pleasure and
observing people. He sat in a certain
restaurant almost every evening for
an hour or two, taking a glass of wine
and then walking home.
Menzel's work even to within the last
five years was regarded as of a very
high quality. He worked every morn
ing until taken ill. He was often men
tioned as the first artist to receive the
highest Prussian decoration, the Black
Eagle, conferred on him by the pres
ent Emperor, who held him in much
esteem.
By order of the Emperor, the body
of Yon Menzel will be buried here In
the rotunda of the old Museum of Art.
numerable others of more or less im
portance.
The most interesting petition pre
sented was the unanimous voice of the
assemblage that Junipero Serra be one
of the two Californians whose memory
shall be perpetuated In the Hall of
Fame at Washington, D. C.
Congress was memorialized for an
appropriation in behalf of the impover
ished Indians of Southern California.
One of the Interesting questions be
ing asked on all sides by the visitors
is, "Have you met any member of the
hospitality committee?" and the an
swer has invariably been negative.
"Whatever hospitality has been ex
tended has been at our own expense."
is the unanimous verdict.
To-morrow many of the visiting dele
gates will make trips to the coast and
around the kite-shaped track, return
ing north on Saturday.
With a charming greeting from Mrs.
George Law Smith, the newly elected
officers were officially announced and
inducted into office.

TO HEAL BREAK
WITH COLOMBIA
Treaty Being Arranged lo
Remove Friction Caused
by Panamanian Rebellion
TO ADJUST ALL ISSUES
New Republic May Take Over
Portion of Debt â Small
Islands Offered America
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â Minister
Russell, at Bogota, has cabled the State
Department that owing to the dry state
of the Magdalena River, it has been
impossible to forward any mail from
the legation since January 19 and that
there is no prospect of sending any
mail out or in for .some weeks.
The Minister's message is supposed to
be in explanation of his failure to
transmit to the State Department a
copy of the draft of a treaty which he
has been arranging with the Colombian
Foreign Office. Private letters from
Russell a few weeks ago indicated that
he was making excellent progress in
framing a treaty which would remove
the friction between the United States
and Colombia that grew out of the
separation of Panama. Russell was
specially charged by President Roose
velt to redeem the promise the Presi
dent held out to General Reyes that the
I'nited States would use its good offices
to bring about an amicable adjust
ment of the sharp issues between Co
lombia and Panama which out of
the separation.
For one thing, General Reyes asked
a plebiscite to determine by popular
vote whether the separation shoura re
main effective or whether Panama
should rejoin Colombia. The Govern
ment has not transmitted the Colom
bian proposition to Panama and is not
inclined to do so now.
The request of Colombia that Pana
ma assume a proportionate share of the
Colombian national indebtedness has
been reinforced by representations from
European governments, whose citizens
hold Colombian bonds. The American
Minister to Panama was charged by
the President with the presentation of
thie matter to the Panamanian Govern
ment, and it is understood that he has
succeeded in a measure.
Another subject of negotiation be
tween the United States and Colombia,
which has figured in the exchanges of
the last ten years and may again come
to the front at any moment, is the pro
jected sale to the United States of the
old Providence Islands, lying two hun
dred miles off the east coast of Nica
ragua.
Colombia, it is said, is anxious to get
rid of the islands, but owing to the
shallowness of their harbors, they are
not desirable as coaling stations.
FRENCH CRUISER MAY
PROVE A TOTAL LOSS
The Sully Reported to Be Firmly
Fixed on the Rocks in
Allong Bay.
PARIS, Feb. 9.â Dispatches reaching
the Ministry of Marine lead to fears
that the armored cruiser Sully of the
French squadron in Far Eastern wa
ters, which, as announced yesterday,
touched a rock in Allong Bay, will be a
total loss. Admiral Bayle reports that
the cruiser is still firmly fixed on the
rocks and that it has been necessary to
remove the Sully's crew.
The Sully is of 9856 tons displacement,
was built in 1901, and has two 7.6-inch
guns, eight 6.4-inch guns, six 3.9-inch
guns and five torpedo tubes.

MURDERESS EXONERATES
HER XEGRO COMPANION
Mrs. Edward*. Sentenced 1 to Be
Hanged, Says She Alone Is
Guilty.
READING, Pa., Feb. 9. â Mrs. Kate
Edwards, who is under sentence to
: be hanged" with Samuel Greason on
; Thursday next for the murder of her
husband, made a statement to her
<ounsel to-night, in which it is said
I she exonerates Greason from complic
ity in the murder. This statement
will not be given to the public until
it is presented to the Board of Par
dons, but the inference is left that
she has admitted that she alone com
mited the crime.
Mrs. Edward? and Greason. who is
a negro, were convicted of the mur
der of Edwards and since the death
sentence has been pronounced extra'
ordinary efforts have been made tv
save thom*from the gallows. The
Board of Pardons has heretofore r>'
: fused to interfere and the State Su
'â  prenie Court has affirmed the lower
I court's decision.
Mrs. Edwards' .confession, it is
1 thought, will place the case In an en
' tirely new aspect before the Board of
: Pardons. The board will meet " (it
I Harrisburg on February 1 3. the day
before the date fixed for the double
] execution. If the woman'? statement
tg accepted by the board it may shy.?
I tho man's life. If the woman is spared
1 it will therefore be entirely on senti
1 mental grounds, as strong pressure if
beinK brought before the board not
. to permit the woman to be hanged-

Agricultural Bill in Senate.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â The Senate
devoted the day to debate on the agri
cultural appropriation bill. There was
a renewal of the discussion of the pol
icy of distributing the appropriation
bills among a number of committees.
Gorman and Spooner contended that
the change had resulted in a vast in
crease of the cost of conducting the
Government. Hale agreed that in re
cent years there had been a great in
crease in the appropriations, but he
attributed it to what he called the "war
craze."
HOTLY SCORES
GENERAL MILES
Mrs. Hays, Daughter of Jeff
Davis, Calls Treatment of
Father Brutal and Cruel
GIVES FULL DETAILS
She Stamps the Officer as
a Liar and Says He Is a
Disgrace to His State
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Feb.
9. â Mrs. J. Hays, daughter of Jefferson
Davis, to-day gave the following in
terview to a Gazette representative
with reference to the statement made
by General Nelson H. Miles,
I was surprised 10 receive a marked edition
of the Richmond (Va.) Times- Dispatch of
Friday, February a. with an article by Lieu
tenant General Nelson A. Miles, headed
"Miles Says Davis Tried to Escape."
The article is a tissue of falsehoods from
beginning to end. General Miles is right in
eaying Jefferson Davis did not surrender when
Richmond was captured. It would be a poor
leader of his people who would do so as long
as even the gnost of escape remained; ai long
as there were men left with spirits as daunt
less as his own, willing to ligut for their
cause and their rights.
When Mr. Davis was captured and left with
but one man to guard him he did make an
attempt to escape, and but for an unfortunate
accident he would probably have succeeded.
Ueneral Milts, however, with his usual eva
sion of the truth, neglected to say where this
t ttort was made, and leaves it to be supposed
it was made in his cell at Fortress Monroe
instead of in the woods" of Georgia. Imme
diately after his incarceration Mr. Davis was
ill enough to make it necessary to havo Pr.
John Craven in attendance and was guarded
day and night so vigilantly that even a
younger, stronger ami healthier man would
have found it impossible to escape.
Mr. Davis was brought by General Miles to
Fortress Monroe on the â¢d of May. Mr.
Davis requested to see General Miles, not be
lieving the United States Government had or
dered shackles put upon a prisoner of state.
Captain Titlow advised him to submit with
patience, as he. being a soldier was bound to
execute orders. Mr. Davis then answered:
"These are not orders for a soldier. They are
order for a Jailer, for a hangman, which no
soldier wearing a sword should accept. I tÂ«li
you the world will ring with this disgrace
when the war is over. The South is con
quered, and it is for the sons of America, as
well as for my own honor and life that I
plead against this degradation. Kill me
rather than Inflict on me and on my people
this insult worse than death. There must be
some mistake. General Miles can telegraph.
No such outrage as you threaten me with is
on record in the history of nations."
Captain Titlow, feeling he was powerless to
do anything but obey the orders General Miles
gave him. saying they wen. orders he had re
ceived from Washington, told the blacksmith
to do his duty. Captain Titlow called in a
sergeant and a file of soldiers and the ser
geant attempted to seize Mr. Davis, when Mr.
Davis resisted him and so great wan the
agony of shame he endured, it lent him an
extraordinary strength so that only after hr
was assailed and held down by four powerful
men could the blacksmith put on the shackles.
General Miles refused to have the shacb.es
removed in spite of the fact that he was al
lowed by Assistant Secretary of War Charles
A. Dana to use his discretion, as General Milts
!:imself states in his article. Mr. Davis would
have certainly died under the tortures General
Miles, inflicted upon him in denying him the
necessary quiet his extreme nervous exhaus
tion demanded, as well as from the starvation
incident to his inability to cat the coarse food
General Miles ordered had not Dr Craven in
sisted or. General Miles allowing him to send
specially prepared food from his own table.
I am sure the testimony I offer proves Gen
' ral Miles unmanly, brutal, cruelâ all that an
American soldier should not be, and a disgrace
to his State.
BOSTON, Feb. 9.â ln a statement
concerning the recent discussion of the
imprisonment of Jefferson Davit at
Fortress Monroe in 1865-66, General
Nelson A. Miles says:
The matter has been agitated at different
periods during the last forty years, but never
before has it been diicused in the halls of
Congress. As far as my official action Ifl con
cerned It was directed by the highest au
thority; it received the approval and has
never been questioned hy my superiors or the
Government. I have no apology to offer of
any kind to any person. The charges that the
acts of tho highest officials of the Govern
ment or myself were prompted for the purpose
of humiliating Mr. Davis or the people* who
associated and sympathized with him is as
puerile as it is utterly untrut?. It is to be re
gretted that the high officials. President John
son Secretaries' Stanton and Dana. Judge Ad
coate General Holt and Major General Halleek.
are not living in order that they might answer
the vicious vituperation by which their names
are now assailed. Still. I am sure that they
airted in good faith and. as they believed, for
the best interests of the country upon the in-
I formation then in their possession and the
condition of the country at that time.

It is not nearly so bad a wreck as was indi

usual. But two of those injured are in a se
rious condition and their injuries are not be
lieved to be fatal. There were several injured
besides those whose names have been glvvn

THE SACRAMENTO TRAGEDY.
WHAT was at first called a sensation, gathering around four
Senators at Sacramento charged with bribery, has now be
come a tragedy. To the testimony of the witness who was
1 'fTered immunity from the Senators for a consideration, and of the j
: esses to the transfer of the cash, is now added that of the agent j
1 f the Senators, who did the negotiating and passed the bribes, j
Wink there is evidence in his testimony that he strove to "save his
face'" as much as possible, yet it completes the chain of legal proof of
:he commission of a crime.
In its present aspect the case seems complete. The public is
iving an impressive lesson. The police establishment of this '
and these Senators being under fire at the same time, those who '.
â¢ose to promote a revival of high character in public life find j
1 heir argument made for them. In these scandals members of all j
parties are involved, and as there seems to be a criminal combination !
between the bad in all parties it must naturally be offset and de- |
feated and its purpose made impossible by a combination of the hon- j
orable in all parties.
The logic of the situation is as plain as is the necessity for
remedy. The men who may be found guilty in these exposed trans
actions will be punished, but that will neither punish nor admonish
the system which is responsible for them and their transgressions.
That can be done only by civic honesty and honor and decency taking
charge of city politics.
It may be answered that half of the accused Senators are from
tricts outside of San Francisco. That is true, but they would be j
unaccused and free to-day except for affiliation with those who know 1
expertly the criminal opportunities for gain offered by city politics. J
In it all is the most pitiful feature of the innocent suffering shame '
with the guilty. A wife's pride is touched by the political elevation
her husband, and when that elevation is followed by a fall so i
profound there is no meter to measure the suffering that follows j
ifiable pride. But the one who should think of this suffering I
before he caused it bears the blame, and society cannot be asked to
be thoughtful where he has been reckless.
CALIFORNIA AT ST. LOUIS.
THE awards made at St. Louis mean something. They are the j
result of prolonged and careful examination by the several juries i
and are intended to reflect the matured judgment of experts.
When General Chipman, president of the State Board of Trade, vis- :
ited the exposition he made a comprehensive examination of the :
whole, and of California's comparative relation to competitive ex- i
hibits. On his return he made to the board an exceedingly interest- I
ing report, which was issued as a bulletin. It forecast the awards as â 
far as California is concerned, and the result confirms his judgment. !
This State takes seven hundred prizes, covering a wider and
more valuable range of products, achievements and resources than
any other State in the Union or any other country in the world. In
what is mined we go from infusorial earth to gold. We exhibited the
greatest variety of fruits of any part of the world, and it is affirmed
by a grand prize. Our vegetables have equal recognition. Our
scholastic establishments and achievements get the grand honors, ,
and we wish the Legislature to take notice that among them the neg
lected San Francisco Normal School has high rank, though conducted
in a borrowed building that is condemned by the Board of Health.
c grand prize carries with it a valuable lesson. The most !
meritorious exhibit may get no consideration because of its defective |
ngement for study and observation, while one less worthy may,
-auk it by reason of skill in its display. Such expositions are the
>>how windows of the States and countries and producers, who resort
to them, and unattractive dressing of the window may destroy all
good effect. California gets a grand prize for the style of the in
'ation of its exhibit. At Paris the State Commission, having no
erience in installation, made most ineffective use of its material.
The State Board of Trade has made a specialty of installation at
Atlanta, Hamburg, Chicago and Buffalo, and when its secretary, Mr.
Filcher. was selected by Governor Pardee as a commissioner to St.
Louis and Mr. Wiggin of Los Angeles was associated with him,
the State secured the best exhibit installers in the world. Even the
French, with their exquisite sense of the value of display, did not
succeed in excelling these two Califojpians. Their skill and taste
were at the service of the representatives of the various cities and
counties of the State, and the result was that wherever anything from
California was exhibited, were it a potato, a chispa of gold, a box
of fruit, a piece of timber, or canned or dried fruit, or wine, brandy
or olive oil, it was artfully assisted in showing its best.
Skill and experience, good taste and a sense of setting and
portion, of balance and contrast, were at the service of every
thing Californian. Our exhibit was sumptuous and the exhibitors
have a right to feel proud of it and of the recognition it had from
the juries.
Some features brought out by the awards are of special signi
ficance. For the first time at such an exposition this State enters
the lists as a competitor with Greece in the production of figs. We
had lonÂ£ grown all varieties of figs except that one of which Greece
had a monopoly. That monopoly was long so well guarded that cut
ting? of what is known as the Smyrna fig could not be had. It was
doubly guarded by the jealous Greeks and by a peculiarity of nature.
Like all figs, being inflorescent, unlike all others it is unisexual and
requires fertilization of its flowers to produce fruit.
In Greece this fertilization is effected by a minute and migratory
insect. It is a wonderful exhibition of the processes of nature. This
insect breeds inside the wild fig and leaves the fruit just as it is
laden with pollen, which adheres to the insect as it issues. This oc
curs just as the Smyrna fig is ready for pollination, and the insect
enters that fruit, pollinating it, and there produces another colony,
which in due time migrates to the wild fig. California finally pro
cured the Smyrna and the tree thrived, but the fruit never perfected,
for lack of pollination. Finally, by the help of the Agricultural De
partment, the wild trees, fruited and with the useful insect inside the
fruit, were brought here, and the task of preserving them was un
dertaken by Mr. Roeding of Fresno, who had a barren orchard of
Smyrna fig trees.
It is a romance of horticulture. The wild trees went through
the winter, and in the spring only 800 figs remained on them. But
from these at the proper season the little insects issued, and guided
by instinct found and entered the Smyrna figs. The State is now
exporting several carloads a year of perfected Smyrna figs, and as
we have plenty of cuttings to start new orchards of "both the Smyrna
and wild fig we have outwitted the Greeks. All this was recog
nized at St. Louis by a grand prize to Mr. Roeding.
When Mr. Swingle of the Agricultural Department has com
pleted his work in introducing the Deglet Noor, the finest of the
dates, upon our deserts, we will do in date production what we have
done in figs, olives and raisins, and a grand prize in some future
exposition will certify that fact to the world.
The prizes taken at St. Louis are themselves an impressive ex
hibit, and will spur the producers of the State to further exertions.

-% rOU know, of course, that |
â¦ â¢ \/ France Delamere is staying at
I The Oaks?"
â  "Yes, I know."
Harrison, stretched out on
the yellow beach under the shade of a
huge umbrella, turned on his elbow
and looked curiously at his friend.
"You know, too, that you're most
1 idiotically in- love with her!" he said
i quietly.
Dr. Bergen's patrician face flushed
hotly under its deep bronze tan.
"That's a nice speech to fire at a â 
man!" he commented.
Harrison Hill laughed leniently.
! "Oh, you never mind/ what I say.
That's one of the privileges of
friends â "
"And fools," cut in Bergen coolly.
"You have me there,' 'acknowl

j for nothing!"
Max Bergen laughed uneasily and
, evaded a direct reply.
"Miss Delamere is a very beautiful
young woman," he said. "She has

"You have all those," his friend in
j sisted eagerly.
"I met her frequently last winter,"
went on the young surgeon. "She was

"Ah, so that's the reason!" said

I wish to believe her!"
"Hark!" cried Harrison. His red
head was lifted â listening. "Yes," he
called, "Dr. Bergen is here!"
Both men were on their feet in an
instant, Bergen towering over his
companion. An excited group was
bearing down on them. The foremost
â a hysterical woman â spoke.
"It'll take so long to go up to the

Bergen tossed his keys to Hill.

accident happen?"
The woman knew him for one of
the rich city guests at The White
Horses.
"Maybe you won't go," she whined.
"It's over in Washerwoman's row."
Bergen was off on a run. He knew
the poor part of this flourishing sum
mer resort where the laundry work of
visitors was done by resident women.
The little creature who met him at the !
pate of the frame cottage had an ap
pealing face and an air of singular re
finement. Her speech also confirmed
the latter impression.
"She would put on one of my cotton
dresses and help me," she explained.
"She knew I was up with the baby all

"But how did it happen?" he inter

look at the patient. She was lying on
the cheap little bed. A print gown
showed marks of fire and on the left
arm the flimsy material was burned

bewitching face that â drawn with
pain â strove to smile up at him!
Those deep, unforgettable eyes!
"France Delamere!" he cried.
"Women are so awkward!" she pro
tested â and laughed.
He jerked off his coat and went to
work, but his fingers trembled and
there was a queer blur before his eyes.
Hill came up with the bag and heard
all that Greta Fallows had to say. On
his way back he told his companion
what she had said.
"She's a proud little woman. She
would not take all that Miss Dela
mere would have given her, for she's
poor, as you can see. But because
they had been friends and neighbors
when both were children she has al
lowed Miss Delamere to come and help
her, chiefly in taking her chidren off
to a secluded part of the beach and
minding them, while she got through
her laundry work. Is the injury bad,

"Nothing to what it might have

"May God forgive me â and may
she!" prayed Max Bergen. It was not
professional, but next morning when
he bandaged the p#or arm he bent and
kissed it.
"Will you be very angry if I tell you
that I love you?" he questioned.
She smiled up at him from her
couch.
"I'm afraid I would be very disap
pointed if you were never to tell me
that!" she said. >
At the whispered words his face
grew radiant.
"But you don't know what has kept
mo so long from telling you! You
don't know â what an idiot I was!
You've no idea what IâlI â I thought!"
A smile flickered around her mouth
and lingered in her eyes. She laid
velvety pink finger tips against his
lips.
"I know what you have just said,"
I she- answered, "and that is â enough!"

BOY OF SIXTEEN TAKES
A BRIDE OF THE
SAME AGE.
Having broken the records of the
marriage license bureau in Philadel
phia, a 16-year-old pair who obtained
I a pemit to wed hied themselves to .the
office of Magistrate Ack^rman the
other day and were wedded by him.
The ceremony made Miss Mary Raw
i bottom the spouse of William E. Ken
' nedy. Both of them have yet to pass
! their seventeenth birthday, and they do
not look older than they are. Mrs.
Kennedy lived at 1405 Cumberland and
her husband resided with; his parents
at 2449 North Warnock street.
It was at the latter address that the
bride and bridegroom were seen. The
youthful husband answered the ring,
and with much dignity informed the re
porter that "we were married this
morning."
Mrs. Kennedy, hearing her husband's
voice, followed him into the vestibule
and placed her arms affectionately
around his neck. Her big mass of
brown hair fell about her face and she
looked even younger than she is.
"The idea!" she exclaimed. "Why
shouldn't we get married? Just be
cause we are young and little is no
reason against it."
Kennedy vigorously assented to his
better half's views, and when asked if
he intended residing with his parents,
he said:
"Well, I'm not just sure of that."
SPEED LIMIT OF AUTOS.
In some localities the authorities have
so far violated the law of the land, not
writ in books, but in the history of our
Anglo-Saxon race, as to prohibit men
in motor cars from using the public
ways, that are as much theirs as their
horse-driving neighbors'. This matter
of environment, too, is recognized in
the midst of our motor laws by clauses
which, while defining the limits in
miles per hour, also prohibit any "rate
of speed greater than is reasonable and
proper, having regard to the traffic and
use of the highway." Thus the rate of
a mile in six minutes is the lowest re
quired in the streets of New York; yet
the conditions which surround the en
vironments of a motor car in that city's
narrow business, thoroughfares would
often render him who drives a mile in
ten minutes, technically as well as mor
ally, a violator of the law. On the
other hand, most motorists assert, and
with right, that on a country road
without crossings and with no other
vehicle or a pedestriaji in sight a speed
of forty miles per hour is as lawful as
the legal rate of twenty. Conditions
make laws; conditions also, in the
minds of. unprejudiced jurors, excuse
the violation of them. â Leslie's Monthly
Magazine.
AN ARMFUL OF JOY.
Care is a feather and grief is a bubble-
Armful o" joy in a world of trouble!
Bright as if skies
Made the blue of his eyes.
With red lips that know not the meaning
of sighs.
He weeps not the future â he knows not
the past.
Yet he knows there are loving arms
holding him fast;
His pillow of rest
Is a mother's dear breast.
And that's the sweet pillow he's loving
the best!
Blue skies and balmiest blossoms above
himâ
Roses for playmates and lilies to love
him!
Walk, little feet.

roses meet!

TRIALS OF DIGESTION.

good by borax, with spinach or French
beans made green with sulphate of

that for twenty years, how is it to be

GILDED BIRD UNDER FIRE
Hannah Lewis Must Show That Vag
rancy Dragnet Is Not for Her KÂ«nd. -
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Miss Hannah Lewis, with a coiffure
a la Cleo Mcrnde. wanted^ to know what
on earth she had been arrested for.
And what did the charge of vagrancy
mean? If vagrancy consisted in mind
ing one's own business and permitting
other folk to attend to theirs, then she
was guilty and would meekly accept
the penalty by law provided. Or if to
at the role of a Samaritan were va
grancy she had no defense to offer, for
she would concede that the prosecuting
policeman had found two young girls
in her apartments on lower Eddy
street. But as she believed that neither
the keeping of oneself to oneself nor
the bestowal of charitable hospitality
could legally be designated vagrancy,
she would like to know what on earth
she had been arrested for. While yearn
ing for enlightenment on that point,
however, she could curb impatience
long enough to enable her to convey to
the court a word of warning. She was
no spring chicken, either in age or
worldly knowledge, and she would re
mind all concerned that it might be
unwise to impose too heavily on her
benevolent nature. She knew her
rights and was prepared to protect
them, even unto reprisal. That was all.
Then the prosecuting policeman went
ahead with his narrative. He had in
vestigated the defendant's character
and found it not above reproach, inas
much as she. without a daughter's,
wife's or widow's dower, neither wove
nor spun, yet managed to wear fine
raiment, to eat rich viands and to pay
high rental. Then he ascertained she
was harboring two young girls, who
evidently had run away from home to
tread the primrose path of the tender
loin, and he had no doubt they were
contributing to her maintenance by
means which he considered it unneces
sary to describe.
"Do you know, Mr. Smarty," the de
fendant asked, with frigid coldness,
â¢that them two kids had their toes
sticking through their shoes when I
took 'em in an' treated 'em as if they
were my daughters?"
The policeman said he did not know
that, and Judge Mogan asked the wo
man who the girls were.
"Their folks are old friends of mine,"
was her reply.
"What are their names?"
Unprepared for the question, she fal
tered and stammered, and finally said
she had forgotten their names.
"The charge against you is vagran
cy," said his Honor, "and you're lucky
It's not a more serious accusation.
Guilty. Sentence later."
Policemen from the Southern station
pronounced John Schmitt an intracta
ble prisoner. When brought in for
drunkennessâ which has frequently oc
curred â he invariably was so soddenly
stupid that inhalations of ammonia
were necessary to subdue his madden
ing snores, and no sooner was he
awakened than he rattled the bars of
his cell and endeavored to tear up the
floor plates and roared like a hungry
hyena. "When confined in the dark cell
he not only attempted to destroy mu
nicipal property, but also rended his
clothing and never ceased howling.
Judge Fritz gave him five days.

Huph Kranse, who compelled his
young wife to lead a life of shame and
hand to him her earnings, was given
twelve months' imprisonment and a
scathing lecture by Judge Mogan. The
woman was employed in a Market-
Btreet dry iroods store when Krause
wooed, wedded and debased her.

Judge Conlan sent James Kelly, Wil

fellows, to answer in the Superior Court
the charge of burglary. When they ar

After she had dismissed Lee Suen

Welty missed a cage containing five
canaries of exceptional vocal ability.
Her suspicion immediately pointed to
Lee Suen, and Judge Cabanias signed
a warrant authorizing her to have his
apartment In Chinatown searched for
her warblers. The lady was horrified
by the very thought of her feathered
treasures breathing the vitiated at

Oscar Gunther, charged with batter-
Ing George Whitelock of 335 Minna

James Delury that his (Delury's) wife,
who had abandoned her husband and
five children, was living in illicit re
lationship with Gunther. Mrs. Delury
also appeared In court and denied
Whltelock's Insinuation, explaining
that she just happened to dwell in the

Robert Sharkey, -weazened and mid
dle-aged, said it was an Inherited and
Irrepressible penchant for practical Jok
ing that Impelled him to cut the weird
capers that terrorized the school chil
dren. It was unfortunate, he added,
that the youngsters failed to see the
humor of his antics or to accept them
In the spirit of drollery that animated
him. His Intention was not to scare
the little ones, but to afford them In
nocent amusement, such as they de-
rived from the funny pictures in the
Sunday newspaper supplements, not to
mention the hilarity to which they were
provoked by exaggerated portraits of
Bluebeard, the giant whom Jack killed,
the ogre that abducted the princess
and other human monstrosities pictured
in nursery lore. While not priding him
self on possessing rare physical grace,
he was certain that it would be impos
sible for him to give anything like a
correct imitation of the hideous faces
and figures of the myths alluded to.
Yet the very children who laughed at
them ran in affright from him when he
simply grimaced and pretended to rush
at them. As he had said before, it was
very unfortunate.
It was at Jessia and New Anthony
street that Mr. Sharkey*s putative
clowning was brought to a halt. Sev
eral wide-eyed little girls had Inform
ed their parents that he chased and
frightened them, and the parents told
a policeman, who did the" rest. After
he had pleaded Jocularity, the defend
ant averred that he had never unleash
ed it before and surely never would
give it free rein again, whereupon the
Judge, to whom the policeman had
handed a card bearing a penciled mes
sage said:
"Why, you did the very same thing
on Seventeenth street a few days ago,
and would have been arrested then if
you had not succeeded in eluding the
officer who was told of your miscon
duct."
Mr. Sharkey looked uncomfortable
and reluctantry admitted that he play
ed bogie man at the time and place
mentioned by bis Honor. Then the case
was continued for further investiga
tion of Mr. Sharkey*s habits. He say%
he is a bricklayer and resides at 247
Pecond street.
Manuel Carsyli, formally accused of
"refusing to disperse" when ordered to
do bo by Patrolman Skain, pleaded
inability to obey the officer's mandate
unless by means of self-explosion that
would be suicidal, and Judge Mogan
dismissed the case.
For selling a racing pool to a pair
of detectives in Henry Rohr's saloon
at Sutro Heights, Alfred Kidd will be
sentenced by Judge Mogan. Kidd said
he was a photographer and was tem
porarily custodian of the saloon when
the detectives induced him to accept
the bat.
AILING WOMAN
MAKES CHARGES
Mrs. Braning Alleges She
Was Refused Admission to
City and County Hospital
SAYS THAT SHE IS ILL
Assistant Warden McQuaide
on the Other Hand Holds
That She Feigns Sickness
Mrs. Annie Bruning of 2616 Seven
teenth street feels that she has good
cause to complain against the treat
ment she alleges she received at the
hands of officials of the City and
County Hospital on Wednesday. She
says they refused to receive her as an
indoor patient, notwithstanding that
she was suffering acute pains In the
chest and back and head. In order
to gain admission to the Institution
she secured a "permit" from the
Board of Health -and again applied,
but after a second examination, one
having taken place In the morning,
her request to be admitted was once
more refused.
To a Call representative J. P. Mc-
Quaide, assistant warden of the City
and County Hospital, had this to say
about the case:
Mrs. Bruning came Wednesday morning and
was examined by Dr. Turtclot and Dr.
Powers in my presence, and her case did not
warrant her being admitted to the hospital.
They could not find anything tne matter with
her excepting that ehe waa feigning illness.
We know her well here because she waa oper
ated uuon some three months ago and has
since made half a. dozen applications for ad
mittance. Because she is not ordered to G
ward, where she was during her recovery
from the operation, she walks out and goes
Into hysterics
After the examination on WednÂ«seday morn-
Ing we would not receive her because It was
not a hospital case. She returned in the after
noon with a Utter from the Board of Health,
signed by Louis Levy, and was again exam
ined, with the same results. No permit is in
quired by the City and County, Hospital If a
c-asu Is a hospital case.
Warden Martin W. Fleming said he
knew of the woman and of her fre
quent visits to the hospital. He said
that If It had been a hospital case she
would have been admitted.
Mrs. Bruning was seen at her home.
She was In bed and seemed to be In
great distress and said that she was
suffering acutely with pains In her
chest and back and found a
great difficulty In breathing. She
wished that she could get Into
the hospital because her hus
band, who works at an Iron and steel
plant, could not afford to get her a
nurse and she said she was absolutely
| unable to leave her bed. When at
! the City and County Hospital on Wed
, nesday Mrs. Bruning says she had
; three convulsions, and while some
j doctors said she was suffering others
i held that there was nothing the mat
ter with her.

YOELL SHOWS
FAITH IN WIFE
Witness Admits a Woman's
Word Is Better Than
Many Men's Sworn Oaths
LAWYERS BA?tt)Y WORDS
Hoefler Objects to Speech
and Is Told His Meth
od Is a Cheap Claptrap
In the hearing of the Yoell will con
test In Judge Kerrigan's court Attor
ney D. M. Delmas relaxed from the re
lentless line of questions he has been
firing at John H. Toell when the word
of the witness* wife was mentioned.
"I heard that from the lips of my
wife," asserted Yoell.
"But that Is hearsay, is It not?"
asked the attorney.
"Yes, but truer than many men's
oaths." gallantly replied Yoell, repeat-
Ing emphatically. "Yes, truer than
many men's oaths."
"I have not the slightest doubt of
that," said Delmas.
This bit of melodrama was led up to
by Delmas' asking whether J. Alex
ander Yoell had not given several $16
checks to the wife of John H. Yoell.
"Yes," replied the witness, "they were
given monthly for a while, then per
emptorily stopped. I am certain of that,
because my wife and I had no money."
"What were the checks given for?"
was asked.
"To support my wife and her two
children," replied Yoell.
"Were you not practicing law at San
Jose, and did you not have an office
there?" Delmas demanded.
"I was trying to practice law," an
swered Yoell, "but there were times
when we had nothing to eat, on my
father's account."
The last four words were ordered
stricken out.
Bundles of checks In favor of Mrs.
Emily E. Yoell and John H. Yoell were
handed to the witness to Identify. In
looking them over Yoell remarked, "I
haven't shuffled a deck In a long time."
The introduction of the checks was
objected to by Attorney Hoefler. Del
mas replied In detail, and Hoefler In
terrupted, saying that he objected to
Delmas' making a speech.
"In objecting to my making a
speech," retorted Delmas, "the learned
counsel himself makes a longer one.
That objection Is a cheap claptrap of
men who practice law that way."
When questioned about his financial
methods, purporting to show that he
paid one debt by incurring another,
Yoell said, "I had to live somehow."
The witness said that Delmas did not
give him a chance to xplain, but that
In the cross-examination many seem
ing contradictions would be explained.
The case will be resumed at 10 o'clock
Monday.

FOUR FAVORITES CATCH THE EYES OF THE JUDGES AT OAKLAND
MAJOR MANSIR DISQUALIFIED
FOR FOUL TACTICS OF BONNER
Cloverland, the Favorite, Placed First
and Colonel Anderson Moves Up.
Dr,Leggo,TopWelght,
Wins the Handicap
Quite Easily.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
There "was trouble over in military
circles at Oakland track yesterday at a
levee held in the mile and a quarter
purse event, last to be decided. Major
Mansir and Colonel Anderson, both off
on furlough, were starters, Bonner act
ing as guide for the Major.
The colored rider did scramble things â 
worse than a country hotel bartender
trying to shake up a silver fizz, with a
result that Major Mansir won and was
disqualified.
Cloverland. the mount of Harry Mi
chaels, ruled a strong favorite in the
betting. At the end of a mile Circus,
the favorite and Colonel Anderson were
well bunched next the rail. Bonner had
crowded on all sail, and turning wide
Major Mansir looked all over a winner.
Less than a furlong from the wire Bon
ner pulled his mount over to the Inside
and immediately began bumping
Colonel Anderson, which horse was al- ,
most on even terms with Cloverland.
The work was coarse but effective,
for his mount earned a nose decision
over the first choice. Colonel Anderson
finishing third, beaten less than a |
length. On a claim of foul Major Man
sir was rightfully disqualified and
placed third, the race being awarded
to Cloverland.
FOUR FAVORITES SCORE.
Ac the track dries out favorites loom
up to better advantage, four earning
brackets. The weather was fine and the
an- 11 dance large.
Achelita, the Napa Stock Farm en
try, a daughter of Libertine and Mon
yvia. captured the two-year-old scram
ble. Bonner got the filly away first and
the tip-toed her company from start to
finish. Hoffman brought the favorite,
Abe Meyer, from the far rear, beating
Southern Lady for place honors. Semi
lune made a tame showing.
The seven-furlong selling affair fol
lowing was a jackpot, sure, and for a
time nobody had opeaerp. Finally Jack
Little bettered his hand and. closing:
favorite at 16 to 5, won. Wistaria wilted
the last sixteenth, though staying long
enough to lead Sir Dougal out for the
middle section of the purse. Hellas re- I
crived good, healthy backing, for some
apparently unknown reason.
Cousin Carrie, the 11 to 5 favorite,
made a fast circuit of all the bases in
"uturity rourse sprint. Apprentice
Graham handled the mare to grood ad
vantage and she was not headed. Ap
proaching the wire she stumbled once
or twice in the heavy going. Instru
ment, cl sing strongly, only lost by a
neck. Hippomax, after an uneven voy
age, ran third.
I>R. LBGGO'S CLEVER VICTORY.
Charley McCaff.ertys three-year-old
Dr. Leggo conceded weight to every
thing in the seven-furlong handicap
and then won without effort. He closed
favorite coupled with Golden Idol, an
scrambler. The Blute pair, Tim
Hurst and Sais. had a strong following,
but didn't collect anything. The former
led to the stretch, where the best thing
he did was to nearly upset Foncasta.
While Sammy Greenfield on the latter
mare and Willie Daly astride Tim
Hurst v ere jaw-boning and engaging in
h link- grround and lofty tumbling at
the quarter pole in the stretch Bon
ner. with Dr. Leggo, cut loose and
there was nothing to the race. Gate
v.ay on the inside ran second, a quar
\rr of a dozen lengths in advance of
Foncasta.
Louis Ezell's Trapsetter ran like a
reai racehorse in the split of the seven
furlong selling affair. A 12 and 15 to 1
shot, the black, with Barrett in the
saddle, early assumed the lead, breez
ing home ahead of The Stewardess and
Ethel Abbott. Play Ball, the favorite,
wont back in the betting and did not
crack any ice.
TRACK XOTFJS.
Dr. Leggo may win the Ascot Park
Derby if Charley McCaffpity concludes
to ship the colt to Los Angeles.
A splendid field will line up in the
Palace Hotel handicap to-morrow,
should the weather continue fine.
TVjilter Jennings has Dainty at Oak
land again and the great mare will go
if the track is Cast.
A fine of about ?200 would proba
bly enable Bonner to keep his
mour it in future. All sym
pathy ip wasted on the colored rider.
He seldom misses an opportunity to
<ut off or interfere with another rid
*r and if things break badly for him
st times he courts the trouble.
After doing the Los Angeles game,
Joe Ullman, one of the biggest turf
operators in the country, is here.
MRS. BROWN IS WINNER
IN THE FINAL ROUND
Council* Cup for Women Remains in
Possession of San Francisco
Golf Club.
In the final round of the competition
for the council's cup for women,
played yesterday on the course of the
San Francisco Golf and Country Club,
Mrs. R. Gilman Brown beat Mrs. W.
G. Miller, 4 up and 2 to play. Mrs.
Brown's name will be engraved on the
trophy, which her victory has saved
for a later contest.
â¢ Mrs. J. R. Clark, Mrs. W. G. Miller
and Mrs. R. G. Brown now have two
victories each to their credit. A third
victory for any of them will make the
Fiver cup the permanent possession of
the winner.

SPORTSMAN'S SHOW WILL TRANSFORM
PAVILION INTO A FAIRYLAND.
Natures Storehouses to Be Drawn On for Game and Fish
Exhibition Hall Will Be
Redolent With the Odors
of Woods in Springtime
ATHLETES TO PERFORM
Will Take Part in Pastimes
of the Track and Field,
Showing' Various Sports
When the casual spectator steps into
Mechanics' Pavilion on April 1 he will
think he has been transported to
fairyland. Stretching before him will
be a long avenue of immense trees. At
J the far end of the buildine will be a
vista of mountains* with a genuine wa
terfall leaping from rock to rock until
it reaches an immense pond in the cen-
I ter of the building. Indian tepees will
I flank the banks ot" this miniature lake
1 and on all sides will be seen nature's
riches in the shape of the varied animal,
vegetable and fish life of California and
the great West. Such is the central
idea of the sportsman's show which
is being fostered and promoted by the
Pacific Coast Forest, Fish and Game
Association, of which William Greer
Harrison is director general. The il
lustration shows in a small way the
intent of the management. This is the
central decorative idea of the most
novel exhibition ever attempted in Cali
fornia.
The sportsman's show will also be a
nature show, instructive in a larce de
gree and intended to educate Califor
nians as well as picture to Eastern vis
itors the vast natural resources of the
Pacific Slope. This has been called the
sportsman's paradise on account of the
great variety of game and fish that in
habit the mountains and plains,
streams and ocean. For the preserva
tion of this game and fish the exhibi
tion is expected to be of considerable
assistance. A large committee of Cali
fornia's foremost citizens are interested
in making the show a great success
with this Idea always in mind.
Two weeks is the allotted time for
the affair to run and a special attrac
tion will be provided for each after
noon and evening. All forms of out
door sports win be exploited and some
of the indoor sports will be added for
good measure. A rifle ranee for prize
shooting with carbine and revolver will
form one feature. An athletic field will
be utilized for a variety of sports, in
cluding indoor baseball, association
football, basket-ball and kindred Das
times. There will be a stapre for small
er exhibitions. Even the children have
not been overlooked. Dr. F. W. D'Eve
iyn. chairman of the children's com
mittee, announces a special department
will be devoted to an exhibition of
children's pets other than cats and
dogs, the stipulation being that the ex
hibit must be either a bird, animal or
plant reared by the child who enters
it in competition. In this way it is
hoped to foster and encourage the in
nate love of living things In the young.
Robert E. Follett has resigned the
position of manager and director of ex
hibits and the position has been abol
ished, although Mr. Follett remains in
an advisory capacity. He pleaded lack
of knowledge of local conditions and
the reins of management have been
handed to Mr. Harrison, who will de- I
vote his well-known energy and abil
ity to the carrying out of all plans to
make this an exhibition memorable to
California. The separate committees
are all in charge of energetic chair
men. The proceeds will go to charity.
It starts out as a success on these
grounds.
HARRIS SIGNS XEAL.ON
AND COMPLETES TEAM
Noted Amateur Performer Will Hold
Down First Base for the San
Francisco Nine.
The San Francisco baseball team,
for the coming season was completed
yesterday when Manager Hank Har
ris signed "Flash" Nealon, the artful
bush leaguer, to cover the first sta
tion. The deal was made quietly and
after a lot of persuasion on the part
of the magnate, as James C. Nealon,
the noted athlete and father of the
young man, objected strenuously to
his son's playing professional ball.
Nealon is only 20 years old, but
plays a better game than a lot of pro
fessionals. He made quite a record
in the bush leagues last year and Un
cle Hank has been after him 'for a
long time. The youngster will need
some coaching before he can hold
down the first bag to perfection, but
he should make good, as he is a nat
ural sticker and a sensational per
former in the field.
Charley Graham came to terms
with Mike Fisher yesterday and the
Tiger manager has about filled up his
salary list for the season. Graham
will again captain the team. He is at
present on the lookout for promising
bushers to develop into Tigers should
the opportunity present itself.
BRITT IS OFFERED A MATCH
WITH JABEZ WHITE IN MARCH
Club Officials Are Staggered by the
Valuation the Calif ornlan Places
on His Services.
Jimmy Britt can have the interna
tional match he craves with Jabez
White of England next month if he
will say the word. â¢ Alex Greggains
went after the match in earnest yes
terday, but he threw up his hands
when he learned on what terms Britt
would fight. â¢
The match, while an attractive one,
is also expensive. The first item is
$500 expense money for White. As
the promoters are not bidding against
one another this year it is expected
Britt will modify his demands.
Indies to Play Tennis Match.
A handicap doubles tennis^tourna
ment for the young ladies of the an

AUTO COLLIDES WITH CEMENT
BARREL AND IS WRECKE
Machine Driven by Robert Peabody
Has Mishap on First Avenue.
Four Persons Injured.
An automobile piloted by Robert
Peabody collided with a barrel of ce
ment on First avenue and Fulton
street late yesterday afternoon and
was completely demolished, its four oc
cupants being hurled to the ground.
None, of the party was seriously in
jured. Two of them were women, who
were badly bruised. Their names are
not known.
The auto was running down First
avenue at a high rate of speed and the
front wheels struck a rut in the road.
Ac driver, Peabody, who owned the
vehicle, lost control of the steering
gear and the heavy Toledo car crashed
into the barrel of cement, which was
standing among some building mate
rial at the side of the street. All of
the passengers were thrown out. They
were taken to a saloon at the corner of
Fulton street and First avenue and
from there sent to their homes in a
cab.
The machine did not fare as well as
the occupants. The front wheels were
both broken and the body of the car
badly shattered. It was removed to
the Pioneer Garage on Golden Gate
avenue. The matter was hushed up as
much as possible and the names of the
party withheld.

GOLDEN WESTS
BADLY ROUTED
Milwaukee Bowlers Take a
Brace and Eoli Up Big
Score in Second Match
The Milwaukee bowling team man
aged to get Into the game last night
long enough to give the champion
Golden West aggregation a beating
that was almost a disgrace. The final
score of the combat on the California
alleys was 2850 to 2581. The Mil
waukees bowled as they never bowled
before, while the Golden West players
were not there at the critical periods.
The exhibition contest drew a full
hcuse and lots of enthusiasim pre
vailed, as the rival teams are old-time
opponents and each wanted the match
badly. Some excellent scores were
rolled up by several of the contestants.
Lagarde was the star of the night,
rolling 591 in the three games.
A. W. Martin, who made the big
score on the previous evening, started
out like a real breaker of records. His
first game netted him 243. the highest
individual score of the night. The fans
looked for something startling from
Martin in the following contests, but
he fell down in both, scoring 165 In
the second and 180 in the final at
tempt.
The Milwaukees got away with the
first game without apparent effort.
The Golden Wests were there with a
comeback in the following struggle
and routed the Milwaukees by nine
t-en pins. This gave them confidence,
which, however, lasted only for a
minute. The Milwaukees got Into the
gclng for fair in the final mix-up and
there was no chance for their oppo
nents.
This evening the Milwaukees will
be pitted against an all-star team, con
sisting of the reputed best man from
each prominent alley in the city. The
all-star team will be made up as fol
lows: T. E. Burke, Lux. McMullen,

APPLIAXtK CO., Â« OTarrtll street.TAR HAS THRILLING EXPERIENCE UNDER SHIP'S COUNTER
lilS SKIFF 15 RUN DOWN BY COLONIAL EMPIRE
Nearly Dead as
Pliflht Is Dis
covered.
Charter St Paul
for Portland
Run.
A lone sailor, bound in a skiff from
somewhere along the water front to ,
Vallejo. had a thrilling experience and
narrow escape from death last Monday,
when his frail craft was run down, by
the British ship Colonial Empire, bound |
for Port Costa in tow of the Red Stack
tug Sea King, Captain Robert Rasmus
sen. #
Captain Rasmussen, who was direct
ing the ship's course, did not know that
the skiff had been run down, and only
the lucky chance which enabled the
lone navigator to grab a chain swing
ing from the ship's side and the sailor's
strength, which made it possible for
him to hang on, led to the discovery of
the mishap and the rescue of the tar. !
They were off Point Pinole. Captain
Rasmussen had finished luncheon in
the Colonial Empire's cabin and was
pacing the quarterdeck when the air
was rent by a loud cry:
"Help!"
Rasmussen looked all around, and
seeing nothing concluded that the yell
had come from a crowd of skylarking
apprentices in the half-deck.
There was another cry. Then a third.
The last call was fainter than the oth
ers. Looking over the side Rasmussen
discovered the sailor, standing waist
deep in the swirling waters and strug
gling grimly to maintain his grip on
the chain.
The Sea King stopped and backed,
and as way on the ship was reduced
the swamped skiff came to the surface
and took the strain off the arms of the
sailor, who had instinctively held the
skiff with his feet. Two of the ship's
crew were sent down a Jacob's ladder
and the exhausted tar and his skiff
were hoisted on board the Colonial Em
pire. The sailor was given dry clothes,
a hot drink and food- He then fell
asleep and slumbered on the after
hatch until Port Costa was reached. He
was turned over to the police there and
later released.
Before going to sleep the sailor said
he had deserted from the British ship
Chiltonford. but after raking he told
Captain Simpson of the Colonial Em
pire that the desertion was four years
ago.
lAner Coptic Is I.aie.
The non-appearance yesterday of the Occi
dental and Oriental Steamship Company's
liner Coptic, Captain Finch, caused not a
little eurrrise. The Coptic left Honolulu last
Friday at 9 o'clock a. m. Allowing for Â«he
difference in time, she had been out six days
by yesterday noon. The Coptic is the fastest
of the White Star boats on the Orienta4 run.
and usually makes the passage from Honolulu
in about 6 days and 35 hours, . varying never
more than a few hours. It Is subpooed that
the has encountered the heavy weather
through which the liner Alameda passed. The
<i>ptic is brtnging a large - shipment of silk,
and arrangements had been made to ship -the
entire consignment yesterday to New York.
Fh* has en board fourteen tons of raw silk,
valued at *7M.000. No anxiety is felt for the
liner's safety, and there is little doubt .that
sunrise to-day will find her anchored In quar
antine. â  . \
Cuts Ship's Gear.
If the mate of the Prltish ship CliiUonfofd
ever meets the man who cut that vessel's hal
yards last Sunday night there is going to be
fin old-fashioned, rough and tumble fight, no
rules, no quarter. Some member of the crew,
:t la supposed, nursing a grievance but lacking
nerve to take out his spite on the mate man
t<Â» man. got busy Sunday night with a sharp
knife. He cut clear through the main-topsail
halyards and the two topgallant sail halyards,
leaving for the mate the most wholesale Job of
splicing he ever tackled Two men. one of
them the boatswain, are under suspicion. They
have both left the chip, and as the Chlltonford
iÂ» in the stream awaiting sailing orders the
rcate'e flglit is indefinitely postponed.

ANGRY LAWYERS
IN FINAL CLASH
Clunie and Bridg-ford Are
Unsparing in Bitter De
nunciation of Each Other
GRAVE CHARGES MADE
Characters Are Attacked and
Climes Imputed in Ar
guments of Two Executors
A whirlwind finish, in which Shake- I
speare, zoology and criminal law were
drawn upon for a supply of wordy ,
weapons, marked the end yesterday of ;
the hearing of Andrew Clunie's objec- j
tions to the account of E. A. Bridgford .
and Burrell G. White as executors of \
the estate of the late Thomas J. Clv- '
nie. Judge Coffey now has the contro- i
versy under submission. The court an- ;
nounced that the linguistic contest had
not obscured the issues and that the !
charges of misconduct and personal re- )
flections upon the executors, whether j
right or wrong, could not enter into the
consideration of the items of the ac- ,
count in question.
Bridgford, who opened the day's ar- i
gument, proclaimed his reluctance to '
enter into personalities and managed
to suppress his feelings until he had
exhausted his law points in defense of
the many acts of the executors, dealing
particularly with the right to employ
attorneys and pay them out of the ,
funds of the estate.
His conclusion was more exciting than <
his law. He said that he and White >
had been charged with misconduct â â 
looting, embezzlement and other heinous
crimes â but the charges had not been
made by an honest man for honest j
ears, but in order to reach the press
and humiliate the executors before the
public. The motive, he said, was in
Clunie's innate disposition to injure
those who displeased him.
Then Bridgford discussed at some
length a few particularly offensive
characters in Shakespeare, painting in
detail the vileness of Don John, half
brother of Don Pedro, in "Much Ado i
About Nothing." "It has been said," he
declared, "that such a character can- j
not be found in human nature, but we
have him in this case." With like pur- |
pose Bridgford drew odious compari- 1
sons between his enemy and "a heathen |
Chinese," and concluded with a pointed
description of the "brute commonly
known as the skunk."
Clunie's turn came next, and with a j
few sarcastic references to Bridgford's
remarks he said he wanted to quote a I
little Shakespeare also about "sancti- j
monious hypocrites," but Judge Coffey
asked him to '.'cut the literature out
and deal with the case."
Thereupon Clunie Jumped from
charge to charge. He said that Bridg
ford and Grant had formed a law part
nership and divided fees in Justices'
Court cases, and it was reasonable !
that they would divide the $8000 paid ,
Graxit as attorney for the estate. He re
ferred to the settlement with Mrs. Clu
nie for $15p,000, and said it seemed pc- j
culiar, inasmuch as her father had of
fered to settle for $25,000, and then he
asserted that White had recommended
his friend, Ralph Wilson, as Mrs. Clu
nie's attorney, and Wilson had given j
White a tea set after the settlement. "I
think that tea set was a blind," said
Clunie. "These genlemen," he shouted,
"ought not to be here defending any :
case. They ought to be In the dock, and
I will help send them there. They talk
about prosecuting me for criminal libel, j
If they take any such proceedings I
will convince a jury that my charges
are true or I will pay $1000 to some |
charity." Growing in his anger, he ,
talked contemptuously about Bridg
ford's standing as a churchman and at- '
torney, and declared "if my boy relied
upon his protection he would die in the
gutter." He declared that Bridgford ,
had committed a felony in filing for I
record the deed by which Mrs. Clunie
transferred her property to her hus
band, knowing the Instrument to have
been falsely obtained. Numerous equal
ly bitter charges were made before the
attorney concluded.

WOMAN SHOWS NO EMOTION
WHEN VERDICT IS RENDERED
Mrs. Grace Squires Convicted by Jury .
in Judge Cook's Court on Charge
of Burglary.
Mrs. Grace Squires was convicted j
by a jury in Judge Cook's court yes- j
terday on a charge of burglary. When ;
the verdict, was read the woman had |
the same impassive look on her face ;
that characterized her during her j
preliminary hearing in the Po-
Mcc Court. Her little daughter and
her husband, a young miner from I
Downieville, sat beside her. He was ;
the only one of the trio that showed I
any emotion.
The charge on which she was con- i
victed was for breaking into the room j
of Mrs. Verlie Campbell, 123 Turk ;
street, on October 31. Mrs. Camp- I
bell caught her and raised an alarm, i
which led to her arrest. The defend- j
ant on the stand denied that she had \
broken into the room. She said she \
called at the house to engage a room j
and peeing a door open was looking i
into the room when Mrs. Campbell |
appeared. There is another case '
against her for breaking into the
house of Peter Hoy, a jeweler, at 1105
Laguna street, on October 7. She will
probably plead guilty to-day to this
charge.
Detectives found in Mrs. Squire's
room in a house on McAllister street,
near Fillmore. a large assortment of |
stolen property, which was later
identified by the owners. She was at
one time an actress, and Squires is
her second husband.
Grand Army Ladies.
The following women have been
installed as the officers of George H.

ant guard. After the installation Mrs.
M. Merrill Miller, the retiring presi
cte^t, was presented a beautiful crys
tal berry dish in token of apprecia
tion of her services to the circle. On
the afternoon of last Tuesday the
members of this circle enjoyed a
pleasant game of progressive whist in

WATER ABOUNDS
IN THE VALLEY
Geological Survey Submits
Important Report About
State's Greatest Basin
VAST AREA CONCERNED
Hopeful View Entertained
Regarding the Future of
Millions of Bich Acres
S. G. Bennett, engineer of the I'nit
i ed States Geological Survey, has rab
, mltted a report to Governor Pardee
: regarding the progress of Governmen
i tal hydrographic investigation in Cal- :
; ifornia. One claim that he makes is
particularly interesting. He reports :
â¢ that by protecting and extending the
I forested areas and building storage
; reservoirs the water supply of the
Sacramento River, even in years of
i low rainfall, will be greater than is
! required for navigation and for the
I irrigation of the entire valley. This I
statement is enforced by another,
I which notes that the great valley of
| California, where lies the greatest of
I the State's irrigation problems, is
some 400 miles in length and has an
average width of forty miles. The en
â  tire basin, including mountains, has
lan area of 58,000 square miles. The
Sacramento or northern portion of the
; great valley is 140 miles in length and '
â  40 miles in width and contains 2,661,
'â¢ 120 acres.
In another paragraph Bennett re
' ports that the Sacramento Valley pre
sents the greatest possibilities for ir
rigation in the entire West. In part
I the report is as follows:
The greater part of the Sacramento Valley
has been steadily used for crops of wheat and :
barley for the last forty years. These crops
1 formerly yielded as high as sixty bushels to
the acre, but as the demands upon the soil
have bf-en great it is gradually losing its
I power to bear abundantly. Worn out lari'li
bring mortgages and mortgages bring ruin.
This is the short cycle of what happens. In ;
order to restore their productiveness the farmer
must rest his lands by changing his crops from
: year to year, and this can only bÂ« done by ir-
I rigation. It Is at this point that the reclama
tion service hopes to exert an economic influ
i ence by providing an efficient irrigation system
I unaer the provisions of the reclamation act.
The Sacramento Valley presents the great-
I Â«Bt possibilities fcr irrigation in the entire
UWest. The valley Itself possesses thÂ« three
Essentials ntoeasary to great agricultural wealth
! â abundant water, fertile soil and a seaport.
A complete irrigation system is needed to com
plement these natural advantages. The United
; States Geological Survey recognized thÂ« impor
i tance of this and began the survey of reservoir
! sites in 1890 and again in 1900. This work has
i continued since as funds have been available. :
Bennett reports also that the money
! set apart by the State is now used for
the fundamental work of gauging
streams. Seventy-two gauging sta
tions are now maintained and many of
; these are situated on sites of proposed
reservoirs. If the wisdom of stream
gauging should be questioned it will
i be sufficient answer to point to irri
gation reservoirs in California, where
: much of the area that ought to have
been covered with water has been
covered with dust 'or a number of
i years. The great purposes of the for
estry policy are to conserve the water
supply, to prevent floods and to admin
ister the forested area so that it may
furnish a continuous supply of lum
i ber and fuel.
Bennett says of another phase of â¢
the general question:
. Another phase of the water problem in the i
! Sacramento Valley 1b that of power for elec
tric plants. There are twelve power plants for
. long distance electric transmission In the basin.
, The De Sabla is the latest plant to be com
! pleted and is capable of transmitting by elec
j tricity for commercial purposes to a distance
of 220 miles. Hydro- electric power is destined
, to play an important part in the development
of the Sacramento Valley. It is recommended
j that all of the water rights should not be given
away, but that some should bÂ« reserved for
the people.
The latest body of engineers to go into the ,
drainage and reclamation problem of the Sac
ramento Valley was the Commission of En- '
, gineers to the Commirsloner of Public Works
! of California, appointed last year. This body
has just Issued its report, parts of which are
reprinted In the report of the reclamation ?o.-
I vice herewith transmitted. This report out- '
lines the work that has thus far been done
toward the improvement of the channel of the
Sacramento River by the State EngineerinK
Department the Commissioner of Public
Works, United States Engineers' Corps, Debris >
Commission and Commission of Engineer?.
This latest commission shows that any
scheme for carrying away the flood waters of
the Sacramento River must make provision
! for the discharge of 260,000 second feet below j
! the outlet of the Cache Creek slough. They ;
recommend a system of levees and extensive <
I cut-offs an-1 other improvements in the river i
: from Colusa down. It is evident that the best '.
! interests of the State will be conserved if some |
1 of this water is stored in reservoirs for irrl- I
; gaMon purprses. instead of allowing it all to
4 flow on to the ocean.
Throe sites for reservoirs were surveyed and
reported upon by the irrigation survey In 1889 j
I and IS9O. These were at Summit Valley, on I
i the Yuba River, and at Kirkwoods. in Alpine '
[ County and at Twin Lakes, also !n Alpine !
1 County. Numerous reservoir surveys have been ,
â  made by the hydrographic branch in the Sac- j
i ramento Basin and fifteen gauging stations are ,
i being maintained for the accumulation of ac- j
'â â  curate Jata. An estimated annual water sup- \
j ply of 1,541,020 acre-feet can be stored in and |
' delivered from Guenoc. Clear Lake, ln.liar. !
! Valley Briscce. East Park. Mill Site, Big Val- :
; ley and Iron Canyon reservoirs at a total cost j
1 for installation cf Â»5.50Â«,121. or at the rate of ]
: Jtfi tJ-'l p*r a. re-foot for construction of works. I
I If these reservoirs were built under the recla
mation act and paid for in ten equal payments
the cost would be $O.:J6a per acre-foot per an
! num and the reservoirs wouW then become the
j property of the irrigators.
Accompanying the report of Mr.
Bennett is another by W. B. Clapp.
! hydrographer of the United States
I Geological Survey. Clapp reports that j
' particular attention has been Daid to
! the measurement of streams entering
i the Sacramento Valley, as an aid to
i the reclaiming of the overflowed lands
i along the Sacramento River and also
' for the construction of future irriga
tion work necessary for t c highest
development of this valley. The work
has also been widely distributed
throughout the State at such places as
seemed most necessary and urgent.
MORE FINDS NEEDED FOR
STREET PAVING AND SEWERS
Board of Works Confronted With
Deficits in Funds Owing to Kx
u-aoitlinary Expenditures.
The Board of Works yesterday re
quested the Supervisors' Street Com
mittee to hold a conference this after
noon for the purpose of considering
the inadequacy of the street-paving
and sewer repair funds, the conse
quent laying off of forty or fifty em
| ployes and the petition for an extra
appropriation of $40,000 to continue
the work. There is now a deficit of
$5757 29 in the paving fund and $23.
832 74 in the sewer repair fund un
der the oiie-twelfth act. due to the
extraordinary expenditures not con
templated when the appropriation of
$50,000 was made. The break at the
foot of Pillmore street ate un $11,000,
and the break in Tennessee street
cost $6000 more. The board points to
the records to show that no funds
were diverged.

cret service. " These two men had ma
before them on many occasions trying
to extract Information from me that
I did not have, and now because I
I would not help them to railroad an in
| nocent man to prison they have had
i Mr. North take this aten against me.
LETTERS WERE GOSSIP.
"The burden of the accusation against
me is contained in my letters that were
taken from Mr. Eca da Silva when he
was taken Into custody in St. Louis.
But I betrayed no secrets of the office.
A perusal of the misives will convince
any fair-minded person that I wrote of
m/thingf that was not vt common
knowledge and printed at length in the
press. I merely gossipÂ«d about things
in general and did not give Eca da
Silva any secret information.
"I did refer to Mr. North as arrogant
and cowardly, but that cannot be re
garded as betraying office secrets. I
shall certainly combat the effort to
have me dismissed from the service." 1
Da Silva was formerly employed in
the bureau as a Chinese interpreter,
and Commissioner North had occasion
several times to rebuke him for neglect
of duty caused by his loitering about
Miss Burbank's typewriting maehin*
when he should have been elsewhere.
On one of these occasions Da riilva was
requested by Mr. North to keep away
from Miss Burbank, and Da Silva with
all the ardor of an accepted lover re
plied:
. DA SILVA ASSERTS RIGHTS.
"This lady, sir, is my fiancee, and I
have a right to speak with her."
"But you are a married man and not
yet divorced," suggested Mr. North.
Hot words ensued between the two
men, and Mr. North made complaint
against Da Sllva. whose connection
with the office ceased shortly there
after. At that time a divorce suit was
pending between Da Silva and his wife,
a Japanese woman of education. They
have since been divorced.
When Da Silva returned from China
with Lee Toy on the steamship Doric
on August 6 of last year Miss Burbank
met him at the gang plank, threw her
arms around his neck and in the pres
ence of Customs officials and immigrant
inspectors greeted him with a soulful
kiss full upon his lips.
The letter b changes the ills that
flesh is heir to 10 bills.

Light-Headed Females Gath

LIKE A TRIUMPHAL TOUR
Alleged Poisoner of Many
Wives Throws Kisses to
the Admiring Throngs
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CHICAGO, Feb. 11. â The examina
tion of Johann Hoch by the police was
concluded after midnight. Just be
fore its close he confessed that he had
! married ten women. Hoch also ad
mitted that he had intended to com
mit suicide and that the white powder
I found in a fountain pen taken from
his room in New York was arsenic,
which he had purchased with trie in
tention of killing himself.
CHICAGO, Feb. 9.â Like a conaueror !
returning from his triumphs. Johann j
Hoch, Chicago's "Bluebeard*" came j
back to the city to-night to face the i
array of wives he is charged with hav
ing accumulated during his marrying
career. Three thousand persons met
him at the Van Buren street station 1
when the Nickel Plate train from New ;
YorK steamed in. Most of them were
women. They ranged from gray-haired
matrons, dragging children by the ,
hand, to 16-year-old girls. In their
maudlin desire to see the prisoner they
rushed and fought and screamed.
Disappointment was the lot of the
morbid, hungry mass. The police had
taken the fat little German out of a
rear entrance, where he was placed in
a carriage and conveyed to the Chicago
avenue station. He was hurried to
Inspector Shippy's private office, where
"sweatbox" methods were immediately
instituted.
Only three of the many Mrs. Hochs
1 were present Two of them positively
I Identified Hoch as the man they had
married.
Hoch was greeted by large crowds at
the various stations where his train
stopped during the day. Women waved
their handkerchiefs and men and boys
shouted their greeting to the man
I whose wives are now numbered by the
1 score. Hoch apparently felt that the
I tribute thus paid made his journey in
; custody of Detective Michael Loftus.
! to trial for many offenses, a grand tri
umphal progress.
At Bellevue, 0., when young wo-,
men waved their handkerchiefs to
him, Hoch half arose from his seat.
1 bowed deferentially and kissed his
: hand with much gallantry. As the
train pulled out from the station he
waved his hand gayly and threw more
kisses to the young women to whom
he was given no opportunity of pay
ing court, as he confessed he would
have liked fo do. This performance
was repeated at several other stopping
places.
The inquest on Mrs. Welker Hoch be
gan at 2 o'clock this afternoon. AftÂ«r
the taking of preliminary evidence it
was decided to continue the hearing
until to-morrow. Several of Hoch's
victims are expected to testify then.
Hoch evidently had expected a great
er number of his wives to meet him at
the station and he was plainly dis
appointed that they did not come.
"Where arc these fourteen wives you
talked so much about?'' he asked of
Detective Loftus. "I guess you have
been joking me about part of the busi
1 ness; otherwise there could not be four-
I teen, for I never had that many.
i There seems to be a lot of women who
seem to think that I am the only man
I in the world who could marry them
and get away with some of their
money."
An interrogation of Hoch waa com
menced at 7:30 o'clock to-night and
was not yet ended at mianight. Hoch
at the outset admitted that he had
married Mrs. Marie Goerk Hoch and
that the marriage was illegal. He
would admit nothing else.
During the evening five more women
who claimed to be wives of Hoch
called at the police station. One of
them, Mrs. Emllie Fischer Hoch. saw
I the prisoner for a minute and saluted
! him with the exclamation:
"You old hog, you got my $750. didn't
you?"
Hoch made no reply to this, but
smiled as though he considered the
affair of $750 rather a Joke than other
wise.
Later the five women were, one at a
time, admitted into the office of the
I Inspector and all of them identified
! Hoch as the man to whom they were
j married. Mrs. Ellen Hoppe at first
declared that she had married Hoch.
but later said she was not sure about
it. Inspector Shippy asked:
"Hoch, did you marry this woman?"
"No," replied Hoch, "but maybe I
will if you don't hustle her out of here
pretty quick."

bigamy when she married Hoch, was

serious alarm in Wall street; albeit there Is
little prospect of such legislation becoming

and this is a powerful instrument In hands of
cliques, which single out first one property and
then another for their operations. Since pros
perity has been amply discounted and the In

prices are dividend prospects cr deals of one
sort or another among railroads. These are
ihe potent influences on the stock market at
present â influences, it may be noted, which in
Ihe past huve generally marked the climax in
an upward market. In the present situation,
however, it would be premature to assert that

A broker's wire from New York yesterday
said:
"Banking interest! here have been discou*^!
aging the operations of a certain Western '
clique of rich men who stand ready to plunge j
into the market, on a large scale. These peo- i
pie. we understand, have been warned to keep
hanjÂ» off. This market is on a stable basis
to-day and the bankers propose to keep it
there."

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 9. â Some ! reluctance de
' veloped In the upward movement of price* on
the Stock Exchange to-day and the efforts to
' get them higher were largely relinquished as
I the day wore on. The strength of a few
stocks did not serve to prevent the average
â  level of prices from dipping lower than last j
i night. But the effect of the decline was to I
> sink the trading into great dullness and to
suspend prices at a range only slightly below
' las.- night. It Is regarded as a technical
, evidence of strength in the market after an
â  extensive rise if a pause or a setback in the
! movement does not bring out large offerings '
i of speculative holdings to realize profits or j
ito save losses. One of the most striking |
features of the recent market is the seeming
, disappearance of stocks and their failure to
come out except at a substantial enhancement
i in the price. The pause in the demand to-day
was most apparent, but its causes were ob
scure. Although the admission to the Aichlson
directorate of Union Pacific Interests is re
| garded as giving a measure nf credit to Â»any ;
rumors of railroad deals, the stocks affected I
hang back. The same was true of the United
; States Steel stocks on the conditions reported
â  in that trade, for which a leading authority
I â uses the emphatic term "astounding." That
I is to say. with production at the high record
rate it is still below the rate of consumption
; at. shown by the decline in the stocks on hand
during January. The failure to respond by
the Flee} stocks and the Pacifies to news of
this character arouses the fear on the part
! of operators that other important developments
i which have been rumored may fall to move
'â  prices upon their announcement even should
: they prove true. Sentiment was affected also
: by the report of the intended departure cm a
I long trip of an influential party of speculative,
operators. Another influence was the stiffen
â  ing of the tension on all the lines that make
, for a resumption of -gold- exports to France.
; The cancellation of part of the orders of gold
bars which were to be' sent out to-day led
to a strong â¢ recovery in the exchange market
j here, ' from a fall of sterling at Paris ac
j companied by a stiffening of the discount rate
lin London. There were renewed Inquiries for
fold for export. Official intimation that an
additional Japanese loan was to be negotiated
may have had its effect on the London dis
! count market. Arrangements to ship $3,000,
j 000 more in gold certificates to Cuba on Sat
' urday is to be reckoned with in considering
thÂ« effect on bank reserves here. In spite of |
the course of the exchange market there was
buying of stocks here for London account. i
j The early advance in Pennsylvania and in |
Ortario and Western, the strength of Illinois |
' Central and a renewed rise in the local trac- !
tions about exhausted the list of important
strong stocks. Some of the influences of de
pression were due to discussion of the cost
to the railroads of the war in export grain
rates. The proposition at Albany to tax stock
transfers and the introduction of a measure
looking to the regulation of corporation or
ganizing were influences in the same direc
tion. The discouragement of the buying de
mand permitted the early gains to he generally
wiped out and the market closed easy at
about the lowest. The jump of M"-'< in Great
Northern preferred was without effect in the
late market.
Bonds were irregular. Total sales, par
value, $3,683,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future ; Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 9.â Higher cables caused
some firmness In the â¢ wheat market at the 'â 
opening here. May was unchanged to %@^c
at $1 16% to $1 16 â¢ 'July also waa un- '
changed to V c higher at $1 00% to $1 01%.
3 The initial firmness was due to covering by 'â 
shorts. , Pit traders were generally bearish, the {
liberal receipts, in th^Nortiweet.- apparently 4
being held to outweigh small advances at Liv- I
erpool. i Furthermore- fresh snow had fallen i
throughout the West and / Southwest. - ThÂ« '
July option was especially subject to selling
pressure. â  In consequence the price for the â¢
July delivery dropped to $1 00%. A fairly ac- 1
tive demand for May developed later from f
ecinmiÃsion houses. â¢ May soon â ' rallied to J
$1 19%. In sympathy July advanced $1.01% j
ill 01 ij. Bullishness was dampened, how- !
ever, by advices from the Northwest. Prices {
soon sagged off again on renewed selling and ,
the market closed barely steady with May â at
*1 16%. Final quotations on July were at
$1 0054. - / â  â¢
A revival of interest was ; witnessed in the
corn market, trading being- quite active. May
closed at the top price, 45?ic. ,. i
Strength of corn caused a firmness In the oat i
market. May closed at 30% c. , ;j
Provisions, were firm on a moderate demand ;
from commission houses.' At the close May i
pork was up 7Uc; lard was up sc, and ribs ,
5@7%c higher. * s.

â or abroad. In this market futures were again
E lower, with ! the bears | continuing to hammer
the May option. Sale* In the pit were large.
! The cash grain ,was well held and firm, with
â¢ a fair demand and not much offering. There
Is said to be a good deal of seedy and other
> wise foul Wheat in the country which buyers
do not want, but really choice Wheat Is scarce,
and It is this that keeps cash grain- up, even
though futures break. ,- ;

! offered around the street at 24c witbout find
ing buyers. The large hotels and restaurants
refused to pay over 24% c. and about half of
them would not pay over 24c. All houses were

- Deciduous and Citrus Fruits. :
Aside -' from Mexican Limes. which are
closely cleaned up and firm, all kinds of Citrus
fruits are very weak, with stocks heavy, and,
although prices are all in. favor of the buying |
interests, there is very little movement In the ;
open market, as shipping merchants and dealâ!
I ers who cater to the cheap class of trade can
, buy to better advantage at the auction sales.
The situation In Apples is unchanged. New

Lack of Faith in Stability

F. Bou<hot, who has an enviable rep

puffs, swore to a complaint before Po-
Judge Conlan yesterday charging
< Miiom Comte and his wife A line
Louis Licutare, Andrew Faure. Jules
â¦ 'lames and Joseph Perenon with grand
larceny. The amount alleged in the
complaint is $1000.
Bouchot has occupied three rooms for
th* last two years in a French lodging
house at 632 Broadway. He furnished
the rooms and paid fie rent per month
for them. Comte bought the lodging
houÃf on January 20 and a feu days
later notified Bouch<M that his rent
â uould be $17 50. Bouchot refused to
pay the increase. Bouchot left his
rooms on Tuesday morning, locking the
doore hs usual TVhen he returned he
found that the doors had been opened
and aJ! hie furniture and other effects
had b*>en carried out of the rooms and
srored in an empty room.
When I was In New Orleans," said
Bouchot. in making his complaint to
Judge Conlan. I had $800 deposited in
a bank. The bank failed and I lost my
mow>. I had no more use for banks
and when I came here I kept my sav
in^H in an old sock, which T put in a
flour pack among other things, because
1f a burglar broke into my rooms he
would not think of searching throuch
an old sack. 1 had $1000 in the sock'
and when my furniture was removed
from my ro^ms on Tuesday the money
liad been taken from the sock. It was
found empty in the flour sack. I blame
< V>mt* and his wife for taking my
money. The other four defendants ar* 5
employed doing odd Jobs about the
lodging-house. ] have been told that
ihey assisted in removing my effects
from my rooms."

TALKS ON PHILIPPINES
Guest of Honor Says That
in Manila We Have Best
Strategic Base in East
The California Commandery of the
Loyal Lesion bade farewell to Major
| Gemral Arthur Mac Arthur at a recep
j tion and banquet given at the Occi
j dental Hotel last night. The general
ha<= been commanded by the President
to observe the operations of the Japa- !
nese-Russian war in Manchuria.
In his address Oeneral Mac Arthur
gave some clear-heeded views on the
I Filipino problem. "We have in the
| Philippines. " he declared, "the finest
strategic position in the East. When
I we can attach the natives to us by a
I sense of gratitude and self-interest the
1 position can defend itself. When the
I time comes, as I am sure it will, we
: could nut muskets in their hands and
i have an army of 300,000 fighting men."
General Mac Arthur led up to this
, point with a review of the situation !
i in the Philippine!*. One wajf to gain the ;
gc.'d-wili of the Filipinos, he suggested, ;
was to give them the benefit of free !
j American trade to take the place of the
Spanish trade that is lost to them.
The general was introduced by
â  Colonel W. R. Smedberg. who acted in
stead of (General W. P. Chinman. Mac
! Arthur was given three hearty cheers.
! and when h*> concluded the gathering
united in singing "When Johnnie Comes :
Marching Home."
Other sneakers were Congressman j

' ING IN THAT CAPACITY SINCE RESIGNATION OF C. H. MARKHAM.
m .
Another^witch has been made in the
managerial departments of the West
ern systems of the Harriman lines.
Yesterday a circular bearing the signa
; ture of Julius Kruttsehnitt, director of
maintenance and operations of the Har
riman lines, was issued from the local
offices of the syndicate announcing the
appointment of E. E. Calvin, vice presi
dent and general manager of the Ore
gon Railroad and Navigation Company,
. to the position of general manager of
the Southern Pacific Company, reliev
ing acting General Manager Bancroft,
who will return to his duties at Salt
Lake as general manager of the Oregon
Short Line. The appointment is ef
fective immediately. Calvin is expected
here from the north to-morrow and will
assume charge of the affairs of the
I Southern Pacific on Monday.
It is generally understood in the rail
road building that W. H. Bancroft
could have had the position here had
he desired it, but he preferred to return
to Salt Lake, where he has lived for
some time and has large private inter
i ests. Several times lately E. E. Calvin
i has been mentioned in connection with
! the local position, and the announce
ment of his appointment is not attended
I with much surprise. He is regarded as
one of the brightest of the younger rail- ,
road men in this country and is thor
oughly familiar with the Harriman pol
icy and the affairs of the Southern Pa
j cific Company. As general manager of

SCHUSSLER TELLS ' ABOUT
MILLIONS EXPENDED
Cost of Pilarcitos Reservoir Was Very
Low, Comparatively, Owing to
Low Wages in 1886.
Hermann Schussler's cross-exami
nation by Assistant City and County
Attorney John C. Partridge in the
case of the Spring Valley Water Works
against the Mayor and Supervisors
was resumed yesterday before
United States Commissioner Heacock.
Mr. Schussler put the cost of the Pi
larcitos dam at 54 36,600. while in his
estimate filed with the Supervisors in
1900 he puL,it at $335,700. He failed
to explain this discrepancy to Mr.
Partridge's satisfaction. He also
stated that he made his estimate of
the cost of cement, which amounts to
more than $1,000,000, on the basis of I
the foreign cement used, while Cali
fornia cement Is much cheaper. He
said this was because California ce
ment had not been fully tested by
lapse of time. He also said that the
boom in the Pilarcitos reservoir, would
cost 25 per cent more now than when
It was built, and the Upper Pilarcitos
dam 30 per cent more now than when
it was built, both being due to the
present increased price of labor. He
also said th#t In 1865 wages were
$1 15 a day for ten hours, and at
present they are $2 50 per day of
eight hours.
Company X Entertains.
Company X, First Regiment League
of the Cross Cadets, gave an entertain
ment and dance last night at Golden
Gate Hall, which was attended by a
laige audience. The entertainment
v/at; exceptionally good and each of
the numbers was compelled to respond
to curtain calls. After the entertain
ment the floor was cleared and the re
mainder of the evening was spent in
dancing.
ARREST TRIBOU FOR CRUELTY.âWiI
liam Tribou. ab employe of Contractor Owen
McCue. wu arrested yesterday by officers of
the Humane Society for working two crippled
horses and two galled mules. Two other ani
mals dlrven by another employe of the same
contractor were taken from work.
Company he has had jurisdiction over
all the Southern Pacific lines in Ore
gon, which has naturally kept him in
touch with the operations over the bal
ance of the Southern Pacific system.
Calvin lacks nothing in the way of
experience in railroading, having be
gun his career as a telegraph operator.
For many years he was a division su
perintendent on the lines of the Union
Pacific and the Missouri Pacific, and
later became general superintendent of
the International and Great Northern,
finally rising to the position of vice
president and general manager of the
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany after serving for some time as as
sistant general manager of the Oregon
Short Line.
Although no official announcement as
to who is to succeed Calvin at Portland
was received up to the hour of closing
of the local offices of the Southern Pa
cific Company yesterday, a dispatch
from Chicago said that B. A. Worth
ington, assistant director of. mainten
ance and operations of the Harriman
lines, ha - been chosen by Director
Kruttsehnitt for the vacancy and that
Worthington would leave Chicago im
mediately for his new scene of duty.
While he has been here but a short
time, W. H. Bancroft has shown to the
people of San Francisco' his. ability as
an operating .official and has won
many friends. They will regret that he
has been sent. back to Salt Lake City,
where he expects to go some time next
week.

sessed for $22,390 and the amount offered
was $15,000. The company is anxious to
dispose of the property, but considers
the offer of $15,000 much below its
value. The proceeds of the sales will be
used by the United Railroads in better- !
ments and many needed improvements, j

This week's issue is full to the brim
with sprightly comment and exclusive
news of the literary, social, political,
theatrical and musical worlds. The es
says are of topical interest, the fiction
lias a strong local flavor and the verse is
both grave and gay. The Saunterer tells
of the harsh criticism of some visiting
society women on the clothes and man
ners of San Francisco men: of a society
woman who has taken down the bars
that hedge the smart set: of Bohemian
Club politics; of the revengeful pursuit
of Cornelia Tevis-McKee by the implaca
ble Gerald Hushes. He also calls p.tten
tion to the amusing joker in the new reg
ulations for the purification of the
French restaurants.

HORSE PROBLEM
A SERIOUS ONE
. Richard 111 ; could not have been in
so much of a predicament for a horse
as 13. the San Francisco Fire Depart
ment. Not only does Chief Sullivan j
want one horse, but he -is anxious to |
acquire ra . whole band of them. â¢ The j
difficulty .that confronts "the good of |
the service" is - serious and is "worrying j
the Chief and the Fire Commissioners j
a great dea1. ,.â .,,:â  .~ r \
â¢, The scarcity of â  horses for Fire De- j
partments use -has within a short time |
involved the ; putting out of commis- i
sion: for several hours 'of one of the
most important engine companies in
the city â that on Bush street, near |
Taylor. ': Thore is no certainty that
several other .'companies may not be
come incapacitated if the horse prob- |
lem "= is not. soon solved. â¢ The require
ments of the charter and the diffi
culty of getting i. perfect animals of
1500 and 1600 pounds weight for the
hilly districts of the city has caused
the Chief to go into frequent con
sultation with the ; Commissioners re
garding this embarrassing .crisis.
The Chief says i there are plenty of
horses offered '- of i about 1300 pounds
weight,. but these are not available for
the / hilly sections, and.- \ furthermore,
many ,of them ~ are imperfect. The
placing of Thomas F. Finn. ex-Super
visÂ§r, on the Fire . Commission, ; has
bf-en a great help to the daprtment,
as Mr. Finn is an expert on horses and
has already been able to, give valuable
advice : regarding the ' source 'of supply
and the animals submitted.
Chief Sullivan attributes. the scarcity
of horses ; to . ] the . . lack of . interest
in the breeding of , heavy horses In this
' State. ; . Ex-President J. George * Boyne
I of the Fire Commission and Commis
: sioner Parry also gave ; the same cx
i planation. Dr. Egan. the veterinary
; surgeon, who passes on the horses for
1 the ~ department, is : also. 7 : of â  the ' same
I opinion. ,v These experts say in effect:
! .'* â¢ Before ,' the " Spanish-American war - horsea
were comparatively plentiful. During the war
the - army bought many : fine, large horses .for
shipment to the Philippines. : J Then came the
detail of officers of the :â  German . army, who
bought up thousands of the best horses in the
merkct.\*.-This created a scarcity of both "-nek
I ' and , bUKgy . horses anil ; the San " Francisco Fire
j Department i began to suffer. â¢ :â '-'--
In â¦ addition .'- to ; these drawbacks . the big
trucking companies were, j and â  still â  are, able
I t > pay \ better prices v than ; the city' for big
Iâ¢â¢ horses, m Sometimes ; they pay. as : high as " $350
I for,' 1000-pound; horses.. The Fire Department
I has : sometimes ", been .ab;e to t get .horses, for
â¢ $2Â»s<V average.*, in .small ' lets. â â - The < department
I bug^y" horses > cost about Â» >'Â£Â»."> : and are â  very
} scarce.' The appropriation for fire â  horses this
Lyear ; has been $10,000. and -in face of the fact
i that the need is urgent only 1 $uvc 50 of this
; sum .- has been paid .out. ' . .
The *, charter .provides* that "when; so-called
disabled I horsesâ which . '- are : . < sometimes ' per
t fectly ;i good '. for.' other ,' than â¢, department !"â pur
; poses â arc*. solo the "amount realized for them
. must be ; turned into the . general fund and not
: , rcade available' for use of the Fire Department.
\â ' : ; Commissioner Finn Â» is : giving the
â¢ matter much of Â» his ! attention and will
: render good V service. Commissioners
' Parry and Wreden ' have been carefully
i considering the problem and with Finn
j ill I try ?to reach a solution. V '.'People
in the interior of the State." ' say ' the
Chief and 3 Commissioner Parry, "are
â¢ rot anxious ito 'â  ship i horses ' here be
i cause they w, ! ,what I a", rigid ; exami
nation the animals i must pass Â£ before
{ they are accepted. -I: A horse to be ac
; cepted by J. the department V must -not
\ only be of reasonable price, but abso
f lutely sound." â â  ,
