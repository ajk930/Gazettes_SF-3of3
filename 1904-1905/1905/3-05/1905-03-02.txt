SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, MARCH .2, 1905.
CONTENTS OF WILL WHICH WAS MADE
FEW MONTHS AGO ARE KEPT SECRET
Mrs. Stanford died possessed of an
estate worth from seven to ten mil
lion dollars. Three-fourths of her
property was two years ago turned
over to the university which bears her
deceased son's name. She had
â what she deemed sufficient to keep her
in luxury for the Remainder of her life
.and to feave something for relatives
and fe-iends.
Contrary to what many may sjip
pose, Mrs. Stanford does not leave a
very "large estate to her relatives, for i
during her .lifetime she deeded the
property she inherited from her hus
band to the regents of Stanford Uni
versity, to be held. In trust. for that in
stitution after her death. The last
transfer of importance made by Mrs.
Stanford was about three years ago,
when she made over her magnificent .
residence on California street and at
the same time she practically gave to
the regents of the university a trustee
ship to her jewelry, which she provided
should be disposed of for the benefit
of Leland Stanford Jr. University after
She had passed away. |
_ Of those who are likely to receive a
share of the estate left by Mrs. Stan
ford, it is generally believed that Miss
I Jennie Lathrop and her sister and
j brother, Hermione â¢ and Leland Stan
ford Lathrop, the children of Charles
â¢Lathrop, will fare the best,- for; they
were more frequently in her company
than â¢ the others and deeply in
terested Mrs.' Stanford. Besides these
relatives Mrs. Stanford is survived by
a brother, Ariel . Lathrop *of Albany,
N. Â«Y., two nieces, one in New York
and the other in Brooklyn, the daugh
ters of a late brother, Daniel _S.
Lathrop, end two nieces in Saratoga.
That they have all been provided for
is generally understood, for Mrs. Stan
ford had * frequently remarked to
friends that while she did not see much
of her relatives* in the East she had not
forgotten them, and would remember
them in her will.
Mountford Wilson, Mrs. Sta.iford-'s
attorney, and her brother, Charles
Lathrop, who were' together a large
part of yesterday communicating with
Honolulu relative to the c"are and
shipment of the body to this city,
stated that Mrs. Stanford made her
will a few months ago, but until later
they would not make its contents
known to the outside world.

MAGININGS BROUGHT ON
BY AGE AND GRIEF ARE
ONE VERSION OF MYSTERY
IN FEAR OF POISONING
Charles Lathrop and Intimate
Friends Do Not Credit
! Murder Theory. . '
' The news of the death of Mrs. Stan
ford was a shook to San Francisco, and
crowds were gathered about the bul
letin board durmg'the day, craning for
the meager accounts that came over
the ocean cable. Charles G. Lathrop,
Mrs. Stanford's brother, sought ener
getically throughout the day to get def
inite particulars, but until a late hour
his Information was gained altogether
from the press reports.
Mr. Lathrop would place no credence
in the version that came so persistently
in the news dispatches that his sister
had been poisoned. He gave out a
statement that he did not believe the
sensational reports. In this, he was
supported by Mountford S. "Wilson,
Mrs. Stanford's attorney. They were
agreed that Honolulu had become over
excited and that dispatches were being
sent out recklessly.
The fact that death had followtd so
closely on a reported attempt on the
life of Mrs. Stanford in this city by
means of poison did not seem to give
the brother and the lawyer any occa
sion for misgivings. And many of
those who had known the estimable
woman intimately shook their heads in
doubt as to the tales of poisoning.
By them the suggestion is put for
ward that Mrs. Stanford was the vic
tim of an unfortunate hallucination
that she was to be poisoned. Her ex
clamations when found io Honolulu in
a dying condition are accepted with
much reservation. The recent stories
of her illness and the suspicion of foul
play while In this city are seriously
doubted.- It is rather believed that
Mrs. Stanford was prone to declare
she had been poisoned whenever she
became indisposed. She was 78 years
of are and a failing of her mind was
easily possible.
It was on January 14 that Mrs.
Stanford drank what she afterward
said was a fatal potion at her resl
desice in San Francisco. Detectives
were employed, but after most diligent
effort they* failed utterly to incrimi
nate any one. The Poland water, in
which the poison was thought to have
been placed, was submitted to a
chemical analysis. No report has been
given out as to the result of this, but
inasmuch as the investigation was
dropped it is evident that no strych
nine was found.
Had there been noison in the water
Ijathrop and Wilson would probably
not have been so content yesterday
that Mrs. Stanford was not the victim
of a crime in Honolulu. While they
rraintain the strictest silence, it is sur
mised that they were aware of the hal
lucinations that had marred the hap
piness of Mrs. Stanford.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Mrs. Stanford had told friends la
Honolulu that she left San Francisco
to escape. the murd/FOua purposes of
peopl^f.who.'S'she atfd. w-r- T>ent on
takin* her life by poisoning her with
strychnine. But her physician in this
city says that he advised her to seek
a more salubrious clime for the bron
chial affliction from which she suf
fered. â  - â¢
While the murder theory is not Km
be swept aside, the developments at
Honolulu last night tending to in
crease its probabilities, there Is good
reason for the views entertained by
those that believe Mrs. Stanford's dec
larations as to poisoning wÂ«re the
emanations of a mind somewhat dis
ordered on the subject. It is said that
she had sought surcease in spiritual
ism from her keen sorrows that were
occasioned by the deaths â¢Â£ her much
beloved son and later of her husband
to whom she was devoted in deetf aX
fectlon.
The result was that she brooded until
her mind gave Â«ay under the strata
and the strange hallucination develop
ed that her life was being sought
through the cruel means of poison.
She never could point the finger at
suspicion to any one. nor vere the de
tectives, who aid their utmost to. Sis
cover the slightest clew to the identity
of any person who might have purpose
of murder.
On the other hand, if the suspicion*
circumstances attending the death <*Â£
Mrs. Stanford develop Into proof that
her life was taken the crime will aj>
pall tke civilized wortd. A late cable
from Honolulu say* tttat the bottle <wf
bicaj-bonite of soda from which she
partook before retiring for the night
was filled in San Francisco and had
not been opened before she took thla
last potion to soothe her disturbed
stomach.
Captain of Detectives Burnett cabled
for . particulars last night, believing
that there might be Important work
for him to do In this city.
The local police gave attention In
January to the report that Mrs. Stan
ford bad been poisoned at her resi
dence on Nob Hill and gave It a thor
ough sifting. Th.c conclusion reached
went far to strengthen the suspicion
that the mind of Mrs. Stanford was
weakening and that the dre*d in
which she lived had no foundation la
fact. But the evidence of crime ap
pearing to be much stronger at Hone
lulu, the authorities were asked by
cable last night to communicate the
results of the analyses to this ciftr, so
that investigations can be prosecuted
in this city. The Idea Is scouted by
Acting Chief Spillane that Miss Bertha
Berner. Mrs. Stanford's prirate secre
tary, or Miss May Hunt, her maid,
could In any way be implicated. The
police In Honolulu have them under
surveillance.
RAXLROAD SHOWS RESPECT.
Although Mrs. Stanford had long
ago disposed of her stock in the Cen
tral Pacific and Southern Pacific .
Railroad companies, the fact that her
husband had been one of the found
ers of the great "Western railroad
system, and that she had. for a
time, been Interested In the welfare of
the corporation, was promptly recog
nized yesterday by the head of those
big holding.
Immediately after the cable an
nounced that Mrs. Stanford had
passed away in Honolulu President
Harriman of the Southern Pacific
Company issued through his general
offices in Chicago an order that the
flags on all the staffs of the company
over the entire railroad system, from
Portland to New Orleans and from
San Francisco to og.Jen. be lowered
in respect to the memory of the dead
woman. On nearly all the large
buildings of this city the rtags were
at half-mast, showin? that Califor
nians keenly felt the loss of the gen
erous hearted widow of one of tha
pioneers of the Industrie* of Dm

Bunkers raised his voice in his own de
fense -in Judge * Hart's department -of

thÂ« action of the Senate in finding him
guilty of the charge against him and
ousting him from his office constituted
a jeopardy. and that if the trial pro
ceeded and he were convicted ho would

ment, which is forbidden by the consti
tution. His document was duly record
ed, but it did not save him from, the
ignominy of pleading to the indictment

names of seventeen men remained in

had been impaneled, while the records

JUDGE TORRANCE
SEVERELY SCORED
No Recommenda
tion of Impeach
ment Is Made
j \ SACRAMENTO, March I.â Although
' Superior ' Judge E. S. Torrance of San
Diego is severely censured in the report
I filed to-night by the committee that in-
I vestigated the charges of improper
I conduct against him, no recommenda-
I tion is made for his impeachment. The
j report, which was filed in the Assem
l bly by Chairman Wyand of the Investi
! gating committee, starts out by J recit-
I ing the facts of the inquiry in the south
j and reviews the testimony Of ninety
nine witnesses. The concluding para
graph of the report reads as follows:
We find that tha personal integrity of Judge
Torrance is unchallenged, and his. ability a*
a Jurist unassailable when not viewed or con
sidered with reference to his personal habits,
but. viewing his conduct as we believe it
should be viewed - by lawyers, litigants and
the people ; of the State generally. â  we ' feel
compelled to say ' that his personal 1 habits
conduce to the lowering of the esteem, respect
and confidence in which our Judicial officers
should be held. â¢ . â¢-'â â -. â  !. \- â  -
.Extracts from the findings of the
rommittee in regard, to specific "charges
against the San Diego jurist â  made in
the memorial presented to the Assem
bly by the Bar Association of Los An
geles are as follows:
.As to the specification ' wherein It is charged
that Judge Torrance spent a great deal of hie
time in saloons engaged in gambling and con
sorting with persons of bad reputation, and
was â '. seen .in public places in a drunken j con
dition, and associated with professional gam- .
blers and dissolute and disreputable persons,
we find that "Judge Torrance I had- oh - one - oc
casion . been seen . engaged in playing draw
l>oker for -moiiey in a public saloon -and- that
one of the other persons engaged in such
game was a man who had formerly been
known as a professional gambler. .
7 We -find .that Judge Torrance during the
past two years has on a number of occasions
been seen on the streets of San Diego and
in other public places under the influence of
liquor. That while the degree of intoxica
tfon was i not ' sufficient :to Incapacitate him'
from properly performing, the duties of his of
fice, it. was. on such occasion* sufficient to
attract attention; that when so . intoxicated
Judge Torrance would at times indulge in loud â¢
talk, use profane- language an.l :â¢ engage In
bpisterous . ; conduct, and frequently his con- i
duct when . so intoxicated ..has been unseemly, :
improper and unbecoming 6. man occupying his
position. '.â â 'â . : â¢.7 â â â  - â¢â¢...;â â  â  â¢ ; '"
. We find the evidence.; insufficient to sup
port the. charge that Judge Torrance had fre
quently drunk Intoxicating liquors and ca-'. ,
roused : with litigants and lawyers represent- !
ing . litigants having ' actions and proceedings
pending in hit- court..' .: ; : â¢; v; ... â  '.' i
/ ? The charges of unprofessional . con- j
duct or grossly improper conduct In the â 
trial of certain cases mentioned in the i
memorial â of the Bar Association are !
declared by the committee not to-be]
supported by the evidence presented. I
BUSY DAY IN SENATE
Prison and Game Bills Passed by
Ui>i>er House.
SAi'RAMKNTO, March I.â After a
debate lasting practically all this after
noon. Assemblyman Cans' bill, making
it a thisdemeanor for persons and asso
ciations to connive against and seek to
injure the National Guard of California
was defeated in the Senate,
Keane, Nelson, Markey and Welsh
opposed the bill redhot on general prin
ciples, while Shortridge opposed it on
the ground that any 1 prejudice that
may exist against the National Guard
at this time will soon be overcome by
the great jury of public opinion. Ward
pointed to the fact that the bill was
aimed at a San Diego plumbers' union
that threw out one of its members and
made his effort to gain a livelihood
most difficult because this member waa
a National Guardsman. The San Fran
cisco delegation, while denying that the
San Francisco unions had anything in
their by-laws or principles the
National Guard and pointed to the fact
that many union members f are also
members of the Guard, opposed the bill
to the end. Notwithstanding Ward's
explanation that the bill was based on
only the most patriotic principles it
was defeated, the vote being 12 to 12.
The Assembly committee fish and
game bill, which Wolfe and Leavitt
struggled so hard to amend yesterday,
was finally passed to-day and sent to
the Governor for his signature.
PRISON IMPROVEMENTS.
The bills providing for the improve
ment of Folsom and San Quentin pri
sons also passed the Senate this after
noon. One provides for the appropria
tion of $360,000 for the erection of 800
additional cells at San Quentin, the
installation of a new power plant, and
the extension of the wall; the second
provides for the appropriation of $218.
000 for the construction of 800 addi
tional cells at Folsom and the erection
of a wall around the prison grounds;
the third for the appropriation of $25,
000 for the construction of a hospital
for the criminal insane at Folfiom.
Senator Lukens" bill to fstablish a
tax on Rifts, legacies, Inheritances, be
quests and transfers, which had been
made a special order, also passed the
Senate. This is one of the bills design
ed to reconstruct the revenue and taxa
tion laws of the State, and under its
provisions it is believed $1,000,000 an
nually can be raised, with a corre
sponding decrease in the State tax
rate.
The Senate concurred In the As
pembly amendments to Senator Wolfe s
bill permitting the State Board of Har
bor Commissioners at San Francisco to
insure the State's new property on the
water front of that city. The As-
I sembly amendment fixed the amount at
which the property may be insured at a
maximum of 17G0.000. This is |150.000
in excess of what Wolfe had figured as
I the maximum, and the amendment was
satisfactory to him. The amendments
were concurred in without objection.
The Senate adopted by a rising vote
a resolution offered by Shortridge of
Santa Clara, lamenting the death of
Mrs Jane L. Stanford, and providing
that when the Senate adjourn to-day
it do bo out of respect to her memory.
DAY OF ADJOURNMENT.
The Senate this morning concurred
in the Assembly resolution setting
March 10 as the day of adjournment of
the Legislature. At the hour of noon
on that day the last work will be done
and then will come the singing: of the
"bolo" song, the legislative anthem.
A number of protests to the proposed
amendments to the constitution
changing the present system of revenue
and taxation were filed with the Senate
this morning. .The San Francisco
Merchants' Exchange In a communica
tion asks that the proposed amend
ments- be net adopted; that they pro
vide for gross discrimination against
one set of taxpayers in favor of
another; that they wjill frighten capital
from the State,- retard development and
give rival cornmiinities a great advan
tage over California. Similar ppotesto
were filed by the San Francisco Clear-

MEETING AT CHICAGO
Reduction of Livestock Kates
as Suggested Would Mean
Annual Loss of $2,000,000
Special Dispatch to The Cfcll.
CHICAGO, March I.â Executive of
ficers of Western railroads at a meet
ing here to-day, agreed not to obey
the recent order of the Interstate Com
merce Commission to lower the rates
on livestock at least to the basis of
the rates on livestock products. At
torneys of all the roads united in the
opinion that the courts would not
.sustain the order of the commission,
and that therefore the roads need not
obey the order unless as a matter of
policy.
To reduce the livestock rates to the
basis of the rates on packing-house
products would cost the roads ter
minating here more than $2,000,000 per
year, according to careful estimates.
The plan of increasing the rates on
packing-house products to the basis of
livestock rates was discussed at length
by the railway managers.
The chief obstacle to the plan was a
contract made by the Great Western
to maintain for five years longer the
present rates on packing-house pro
ducts. Despite this many roads favor
ed increasing the rates on packing
house products. They argued that it
would cost them less in the long run to
have the packers divert all their traf
fic to the Great Western that it could
carry, than it would to reduce the
rates on livestock.
At first some of the roads were not
disposed to defy the Interstate Com
merce Commission, fraring their atti
tudo would be cor- = tr,ied as joining thÂ«
beef trust in its fight with the Govern
ment. They were soon convinced,
however, tiat it would be better to
figrht the commission than to concede
the right of that body to fix relative
rates on raw material and finished
products.

hibits Prizefights.
SACRAMENTO, March I.â Ralstons
bill prohibiting prize fighting in Cali
fornia, which was defeated by the Sen

Senate to-night and passed by a vote
of 22 to 12. A long debate took place

the bill again.
"Prize fighting is not half as bad as
football," he said, "and that game is
countenanced by the leading educa
tional institutions of the State."
Senator Markey of San Francisco
said he attended prize fights and knew
the people wanted them.
In a speech bristling with sarcasm,
Senator Haskins of San Francisco said
that if the people of his city wanted
prizefighting stopped it would not be
rccessary to go to Calaveras to find a
man to introduce a bill against It.
Prizefighting was declared by Senatar
Anderson of Orange to be an abomin
able practice. That prizefighting is
popular was the declaration ef Pen

St. Louis Attorney, 65 Years
Old, Sued for Divorce by
His Spouse of Three Score
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, March I.â Suit for dl-
I Torce from Attorney George E. Smith,
; aged 65, the father of Reno Smith of
Lqs Angeles, Miss Adel Smith, a stu
dent at the University of California,
and Miss Ciara Smith, a student at
Bryn Mawr College, was filed here to
day by Mrs. Mary L. Smith, aged 60,
formerly of Los Angeles. They were
married September 28, 1871. They for
: mally separated February 24, Mrs.
Smith alleges.
For twenty years she alleges her
husband has neglected her, failed ade
; quatoly to support her and has been
guilty of cruelty. In March. 1594, she
says, she went with their three minor
children to Los Angeles, where she re
mained until June 21, 1904. He sent
her only a portion of the income from
property she owns in St. Louis, she
says, and when she sent him a sur
. geon's bill for treatment of injuries re
1 ceived in a serious accident he refused
â¢to pay it. She says he prepared his
own breakfast and left the house be
fore daylight, not returning until 9 or
1 10 o'clock at night; that he insisted she
breakfast on corn meal mush and
breakfast food; that he would not let
her prepare his breakfast for him; that
he refused to converse with her or to
occupy the same apartments. On Sun
days, she alleges, he spent his time
reading in a room Insufficiently lighted
and u-hen she attempted to converse
with him retorted angrily and sar
castically. She saya* ne struck her
once and threatened to strike her an
other time when his clothing acci
dentally fell on the floor. Once when
she stumbled on account of a lame
knee from an accident he not only re
fused to assist her in arising, but ac
cused her of being "awkward." When
told o-f the suit Attorney Smith ex
pressed astonishment.
"I saw her this morning when I left,"
he said, "and therefore am surprised
at the statement that a separation oc
curred a week ago."

Stoppage oi News From the
Front Is Regarded as
a Bad Omen.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 2.â The
curtain of a rigid censorship has set
tled down over events in Manchuria-
There is no news of the results of yes
terday's fighting. Dispatches describ
ing the picturesque events of the night
retreat from Dapass and the all
night combat at the railroad bridge
across the Shakhe River have been al
lowed to come through, but nothing to
show whether General Kuropatkin is
withdrawing or is determined lo stand,
his ground. It is significant that no
news has been received from the
threatened left flank, the last dis
patches leaving the Russians clinging
desperately to â¢ Oubenpusa against
strong forces of General Kuroki's vet
erans.
Although It is not admitted at the
War Office, the general impression in
military circles Is that General Kuro
patkin may be forced to withdraw.
Not only is General Kuroki threatening
his communications, but the redoubts
at Puti'.off and Novgorod hills and even
the hills themselves, keys to the posi
tion of the Russian center, appear to
be crumbling away under the impact
of the terrible shells such as leveled
the fortifications of Port Arthur and
rendered the fortress untenable. No
troops will be able to retain the posi
tion long if the bombardment con
tinues.
It develops that the Russians were
unable to hold permanently the south
ern end of the railroad bridge across
the Shakhe River. The advance of the
right wing seems for the moment to
have come to a standstill. Magnificent
spring weather set in to-day.
Two brief dispatches from General
Kuropatkin, dated February 27 and
February 28, confirm the capture of the
head of the Shakhe River bridge. At
tacks by the Japanese on Gauto Pass
were repulsed on "February 27 and .
again on February 28. The Russian
advance gruards still hold their position
at Kudaza. The sharpshooters con
tinue to harass the whole Japanese
fnnt and, it is confirmed, caused con
siderable alarm by the use of hand
grenades at Sandiapu during the night
of February- 27.
SIEGE GUXS HAMMER FUTTLOFF.
SAKHETUN, Manchuria, March I.â
The Japanese to-day opened a tremen
dous flre with field and siege guns
against Putiloff (Lone Tree) Hill. Col
umns of white smoke envelope the hill
on two sides. The bombardment of the
right flank continues.
The artillery fighting continues along
the whole front of about 100 miles. The
Eastern detachment near Konda.yu has
repulsed the Japanese attack. The Jap
anese also have been driven in from
Tunsilai Pass and from the vicinity of
Gauto.
At the bridge over the Shakhe River
a furious struggle continues. A small
wood nearby has continually changed
hands, but it is now definitely occupied
by the Japanese.
It is rumored that a division of the
Japanese on the extreme right is
marching north and has reached Ka
larna.
RUSSIANS FIRING BLINDLY.
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUAR
TERS, Tuesday, Feb. 28.â The Japanese
left wing is driving back the Russian
outposts. The Japanese have occupied
a line from Shatzemun, two miles west
of the Hun River, in a northwest di
rection to Kalita, on the east bank of
the Liao River. A heavy bombardment
along the entire line west of the rail
road is in progress night and day. The
Russians are firing blindly with field
and heavy guns. The Japanese remain
in their positions and make no serious
response to the Russian fire.
L&st night five companies of Russian
Infantry attacked Lantin. aided by a
terrible artillery flre. After desperate
hand-to-hand fighting, which lasted for
an hour and a half, the Russians were
repulsed, leaving sixty dead. Many
trophies were taken, as well as some
prisoners. The Japanese locs did not
exceed fifty.
Small detachments of Russians also
attacked at many other points, but in
every case they were repulsed.
SLAV ATTACKS REPULSED.
TOKIO, March I.â The headquarters
of the Japanese army on the Shakhe
River, telegraphing yesterday, says:
"The enemy's batteries at Tungyou
Mountain and the northern height of
Tangchiatun commenced bombarding
at four o'clock to-day. We did not
reply.
"On Monday nipht the enemy's field
guns at Shupangtai and heavy guns at
Wenchengpao concentrated their fire
on our outposts in the vicinity of the
railroad bridge. At 1 o'clock in the
morning five companies of Infantry ad
vanced on either side- of the railroad
and surrounded our outposts. Finally
part of the enemy charged Into our
trenches and engaged in a fierce hand
to-hand fight. Our posts had repulsed
the enemy entirely at 3 o'clock in the
morning. The enuny left sixty dead,
some prisoners and some spoils.
"Small bodies pi the enemy at Wan
chiayuantzu, Ranchiatzu and Lapatai
have been repulsed."
STUBBORN FIGHT AT NIGHT.'
Japanese Retake Shakbe Bridge Cap-
tured by Russians.
HUAN MOUNTAIN, March I.â After
an all-night battle the Russian forces
which seized the railroad bridge across
the Shakhe River retired after having
destroyed the Japanese fortifications at
the farther end of the bridge and
thrown the Japanese forces into con
sternation. The Japanese losses were
heavy.
The attack on the bridge began at
& o'clock Tuesday evening. Under cover
of a heavy bombardment, Russian
chasseurs dashed forward and crossed
the bridge, drove back the defenders
and occupied the farther end of the
bridge.
There the chasseurs threw ud hasty
intrenchments and soon drove the Jap
anese from their defenses at the head
r.f the bridge. An hour later the chas
seurs rushed across the bridge and
seized and fortified a thicket opposite
Lamuting, overcoming a number of
v ire entanglements and blowing up the
Japanese redoubts. An artillery com
pany kept up the bombardment and
succeeded In demolishing the Japanese
searchlights.
Then a stubborn fight in the dark

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL", THURSDAY, MARCH 2. 1905.
PLOD THROUGH
DEEP SNOW ON
THEIR RETREAT
Hard Night March of
Rennenkampff's
Troops.
OUBENEPUZA, Tuesday, Feb. JB.â
One of the coldest and most cheerless
operations of the winter's warfare in
Manchuria was the thirteen-mile re
treat of the Tsinkhetchen division on
the night of February' 26 from Da Pass
to Oubenepuza. All day General Ren
rienkampff's soldiers, wearied by a
! week of continual fighting and dis
â¢ heartened by the abandonment of
I Tfcinkketchen, had flung off attack
after attack by overwhelming numbers
of Japanese, in order to cover the with
} drawal of supplies, which had been ac
i cumulated in large warehouses at
! Solun. This village Is eight miles in
the rear and at the head of a horse
cart road, which was constructed to
the base at Mukden, in order to pro
vision the advanced positions on the
left flank. It is five miles north of the
village of Oubenepuza, where the road
from Gao Pass to the eastward Joins
\ the main Tsinkhetchen-Fuchun high
i way.
At 6 o'clock on the evening of Feb
ruary 26 the commander of the bat
talion on the Gao Pass road sent word
i that he was unable longer to hold out
i against the Japanese advancing in that
direction; but the commander of the
division was determined to hold on un
til the last wagon should have left
Solun. Word was received at 9 o'clock
that the withdrawal had been safely
I effected, and then the dreary retreat
| began.
The wind was high, the snow was
! falling heavily. Every moment the
i cannonading of the Gao Pass road be
came louder, and the bursting of shrap-
I nel illuminated the heights to the east-
I ward. It became evident to every man
I of the command plodding through the
deepening snow that the danger of
i being cut off was Imminent. Only the
I coolness and courage of the commander
; averted disaster.
The retreat was so timed that the
rear guard reached Oubenepuza just in
time. The force retreating on the
easterly road had been driven In on
the village and the two forces, uniting,
fixed bayonets, turned about and in
the utter darkness drove the Japanese
back two miles.
On February' 27 the Japanese re*
newed the attack, but the Russians re
pulsed repeated assaults. To-day
(February 28) there was desperate
fighting, but the Russians had suc
ceeded in retaining possession of the
village.
The Japanese fought with fanatical
bravery, making several night attacks
and charging under cover of darkness
and a fierce snow storm almost ud to
the muzzles of the Russian batteries,
which met them with canister and
ifrape.
guns and forced the Russians to aban
don the thicket, from which poslton the
Japanese proceeded to bombard the
regiments holding the head of the
bridge. The fight was desperate and
at close quarters. The Japanese rushed
up heavy columns of reinforcements
and charged repeatedly across the
river, strewing the ice with the bodies
of their dead.
At dawn the Russians retired across
the river, carrying their wounded, but
leaving 100 dead.
The Russians are exultant over the
losses inflicted upon the Japanese in
this sally and are eager to renew the
fight.
BOMBARDMENT IS TERRIFIC.
Rnpsian Cannon Respond Feebly to the
Enemy's Blc SleÂ«e Guns.
MUKDEN, March 1. â For three
days Putiloff and Novgorod hills have
been subjected to a terrific bombard
ment with eleven-inch shells charged
with Shimose powder. From a dis
tance the hills look like volcanoes
spouting flame and great clouds of
smoke, a hail of earth and stones fall
ing far beyond their bases. The Rus
sian siege batteries are answering
energetically, but their flre is com
paratively ineffectual.
All is quiet on the right flank. It be
ing reported that General Nogi is
operating against the left flank. The
weather to-day was magnificent.

TOPEKA, Kans.. March I.â The
House to-day, 82 Jo 18. passed the anti
discrimination bill, aimed principally
at the Standard Oil Company, and the
last of the anti-trust measures to
come up during this Bession. It now goes
to Governor Hoch. who will sign It.
This bill will reinforce the half-dozen
other anti-trust measures passed by
the present Legislature.
The bill provides that any person or
firm doing business In Kansas "en
gaged in the production, manufacture
or distribution of any commodity in
general use, that such shall discrimi
nate between different sections by sell
ing such commodity at a lower rate in
one section than is charged for such
commodity in another section, after
equalizing the distance from the point
of pr^luction, manufacture or distribu
tion, and freight rates therefrom, shall
fee guilty of unfair -discrimination."
A fine of $1000 for each and every
violation of the act is recommended
and the charter may be revoked.
The maximum freight rate law re
cently passed by the Legislature went
Into effect to-day. In conformance
with this law the railroads operating
in the oil fields have compiled the new
classification of oil rates. If the rate
is made in accordance with the law, it

Kansas.
All the railroad companies in the
State, with the exception of the Santa
Fe, are made parties to the suit. In
addition to these action is brought
against the Transcontinental Freight
Bureau, the Western Trunk Line Com
pany and the Southwestern Traffic
Company. All of these concerns are
alleged to have entered into an agree
ment with the Standard Oil Company

The petition says no report has been
made to the State as to the solvency
of the Standard and that no charter

CONSTANTINOPLE. March 1. â The
present insurrection in Yemen
Province, Arabia, appears to put in the
shade all previous revolts. The center
of the movement is al Saada, north
v.-OcL of Sanaa, and there are signs of
its extension to the province of Assrye,
The insurgents have again surround
ed Sanaa, and a stubborn fight has been
in progress for five days. Many of tha
Turkish troops refuse to resist any fur
ther and are deserting. In the south the
towns of Aaab and Hidjeh, the latter
containing 2000 troops, with four guns,
are surrounded and are on the point of
capitulating.
The alleged victory of February 1,
when It was officially announced that
the Turkish forces had routed the reb

garrison of Sanaa turns out to have
been an Insurgent success.
Turkey's defective transportation de

STUBBORN FIRE
NOT YET OUT
Steamship Oregon Beached in
the North, but the Flames
Hare Not Been Quenched
EUREKA, March Lâ Like some mon
ster of the deep, with smoldering fire
slowly eating her heart out, the steam
ship Oregon, which took fire off Cres
cent City on Monday, lies beached on
the mud flats with smoke pouring from
her after 'Skylight. The crew of the
vessel is still working to quench the
flames raging in her between decks.
The Oregon arrived"" off the bar at Â»
o'clock this morning from Crescent
City. The vessel came down under her
own gteam.
Up to dark the efforts of the officers,
and crew of the Oregon to quench the
flames have been unsuccessful. The
method adopted of attempting to fill
the : vessel with water proved inade
quate, and the steamship is destined to
spend at least another night battling
with the fire. The vessel cannot be
flooded by means of her own pumps,
and men will bore holes through the
steel plates, through which hoses will
be inserted, and tugs and flre engines i
will pump in water until the space be- !
tween decks, which the vessel's own |
pumps will not reach, will be flooded.
The officers are fearful of an ex- â 
plosion of the gases accumulating in \
the airtight hold. The vessel lies in !
the soft mud and sand and damage to i
her hull will be slight if any.
Rear Admiral Kempff and Inspec- I
tors of Hulls and Boilers Guthrie and i
Dolan arrived from San Francisco on f
the steamship Pomona this morning
and while here will make an inves- ;
tigatlon into the mishap to the Ore- !
gon.
The collier Meteor. Captain Golightly,
which arrived from the north late f
Tuesday night, was the vessel which '
went to the assistance of the burning
steamship Oregon. The Meteor took
the Oregon's passengers to Crescent i
City and there transferred them to the |
steam schooner Del Norte.
Captain Golightly says that he sight
ed the Oregon on Monday about 2:45
p. m. She was about eight miles west
southwest of St. George's Reef. Smoke
was pouring from below and the vessel
was flying the letter N. M., which In
the language of flags means "I am on
fire." _ .
The Meteor Hastened to the burning
; steamship. Captain Warner asked
Captain Golightly to relieve him of his
passengers. Fifty passengers and th*
nine members of the Oregon's crew
i who manned the lifeboats in which the
passengers were carried, were trans
ferred to the Meteor. As soon as the
boats were clear of the Oregon, thnt
vessel went at full speed to Crescent
City, the Meteor following more
leisurely.
Captain Golightly offered to starnl
by the Oregon, but Captain Warner did
not think it necessary, as the fire seem
ed to be under control.
The Oregon's passengers, says Cap
tain Gollghtly, were all in good spirits
except one aged lady who was very
nervous. Hte placed his cabin at the
disposal of .the women and did every
thing in his power for their comfort.
Captain Golightly pays tribute to the
manner in which Captain Warner, his
officers and crew, handled the fire. The
men in the engine-room, he says, de
serve special praise. The fire was hot
and the temperature in the engine
room terrific.. Engineers and firemen
stayed at their posts without a mur
mur, and the blistering heat kept
pumps working and the engines in
commission.
The Oregon's passengers will be
taken to Portland by the Alliance.

Attorney M. Wilson
Scoffs Idea of
Foul Play.
ThÂ« Btory that an attempt to poison
Ms. Stanford was made in San Fran
â¢ on January 14 of thts year ap-
I to have be*>n unfounded. Her at
torneys are reticent about the occur
rence and the other people who have
;: formation on the subject veil their
ideas with the plea of professional se
crecy. Mrs. Stanford was firmly con
vinced that some one ha* tried to take
her life, but her theory could r;
substantiated even after the most
investigation.
J^he was taken sick at her stomach
c evening in question and suffered
lerably for an hour or two Croat
She vomited violently three or
â¢ime-8. Mrs. Stanford immediately
sted poison. An hour previous to
i he attack she had taken a drink of
Poland water. She had stated that it
ed to taste bitter. Elizabeth
Kichmond, a maid, and Mips ]% j rnor.
Mi's. Stanford's companion, b ah tasted
the water and each stated that it tast
â¢ d bitter. An emetic w. given to Mrs.
Stanford, and she had recovered by ihe
next day except that she was sreatly
disturbed by the idea that an attempt
had been made to tako her life.
DOES NOT CONKILT DOCTOR.
No physician was consulted, as Mrs.
Stanford did not have the habit of ap
pealing to doctors except under extra
ordinary <MrcumÃtanees. For a few
days ehe was confined to the house by
an attack of the grip. At that time
Dr. William Boertcke was summoned.
He found that her he it was normal,
that she had some I onchiaj trouble
and that she was otherwise in exoÂ»:lle nt
physical condition for a woman of
her age. Mrs. Stanford stil] adhered to
the theory that she had been deliber
ately poisoned and would talk of little
else.
Some of the water of which she
drank had been saved and this was
subsequently given to Attorney Wilson.
He visited Wakelee's pharmacy, where
his client made her purchases in drugs,
and asked where he fcmrM find a thor
oughly competent analytical chemist.
The manager of the establishment re
ferred him to Louis Falkenau of 528
Sacramento street. Wilson proceeded
to the chemists with Charles Lathrop,
Mrs. Stanford's brother, and directed
that a qualitative and quantitative
analysis be made. . -other bottle of
Poland water was secured at random
and the chemist went to work.
.â  About the result of bis labors there
is still some mystery, although it is
stated from authoritative sources that
the research failed to be productive of
the results expected by Mrs. Stanford.
Strychnine in solution has a bitter
taste and the chemist's experiments
were directed mainly to see if this al
kaloid showed its presence In the reac
tions. Falkenau states that his pro
fessional honor is involved and that he
cannot make public the report hÂ» re
turned to Attorney Wilson. At any
rate neither the lawyer nor Charles
Luathrnp were. at all disturbed by the
Information gleaned, and when the
ftory came from Honolulu that Mrs.
Stanford had be.en poisoned they scorn
ed it. The investigation was immedi
ately, ended when the chemist had fin
ished Ms work.
DETECTIVES LEAR.V NOTHING.
.Meanwhile, aroused by' Mrs.'Stan
ford s assertions that attempt had
. been made to poison her. Attorney Wil-
Eon applied to Harry Morse for good
."men for secret service. These detect
ives made a' complete investigation
of the whole affair. By process of elim

The secret service men. of whom

employes were also traced as far as
"possible. At last Morse reported to
Attorney Wilson that none of the house
servants had the slightest motive for
trying to kill Mrs. Stanford, that none
of them had purchased poison receiltly
and that none of. their relatives, or
friends t had done so for them, so far
as could be learned.
Dr. BoeHcke stated yesterday that
his patient showed no symptoms of
having been poisoned. v She was upset
by the grip and possibly worried, but
no trace of poison was apparent, nor
did Mrs. StanfoFd discuss the subject
â with him. The detectives were dis
missed -and the philanthropist decided
to take a trip abroad. She had planned
â¢several big social affairs, but these
were canceled, and In company â¢ with
Miss Beraer and a maid she sailed for
Japan. c

Mrs, Lathrop Gets Letter-
Before She Learns of
Sad News.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March 1.
When the news or the death of Mrs.
Stanford was received here shortly
after 8 o'clock this morning it came as
a thunderbolt from the clouds. The
information that the woman who had
endowed one of the State's great Feats
of learning had paesed away traveled
like wjldnre, and immediately the' flags
were placed at half mast, the lecture
halls closed and the whole town as >VHI

One of the first persons in Palo Alto
to learn of the death of Mrs. Stanford
was her eistei -in-la\v. Mrs. Charles G.
Lathrop. Just before the pad tiding*
reached her she had perused a letter
from her relative in which Mrs. Stan
ford told of a rough voyage to Hono
lulu, sea sickness and final recovery as
soon as she was installed in her hotel.
This letter was brief. Referring to
her voyage Mrs. Stanford wrote: "The
VOjrage to Honolulu was a very rough
one and 1 was f=irk during the trip.
When I arrived In Honolulu I felt a
change t^r the better and 1 am exceed
ingly well now."
This was probably the last letter
written by Mrs. Stanford. . It was
merely a personal communication and
contained nothing to show that . the
benefactress of the university feared
death from poisoning or, that she hadi
any enemies whom she was trying .to
avoid. She â¢ did not speak of her busi-
affairs in the letter.." :; â¢; '
Mrs. Lathrop Is prostrated at the sad
news of the death of her sister-in-law.
She Is, at a loss to believe whether Mrs.
Stanford was poisoned or whether she
died a natural death, Judging by ; her
conversation it would appear that Mrs.
Lathrop" has grave suspicions, but she
would not express them.: . â * â â 'â¢' â¢*./;
"'We are all shocked at the Fad news,"
said Mrs. Lathrop.this morning. "'We

of seasickness ana slight illness, which

WILL NOT MAKE
ANY CHANGES
Left Says Mrs. Stanford's
Death Does Not Ailect
the College.
"Mrs. Stanford was one of the no
blest, best-hearted and clear-headed
women created by God and her death
is a great loss to the State of Califor
nia," said S. F. Leib, vice president of
the board of trustees of Stanford Uni
versity. "Her sole aim was to live to
see the plans of her husband and her
self carried out. Ker death is a sad af
fair; many will miss this good woman.
It was totally unexpected."
Mr. Leib said that the death of Mrs.
Stanford would make no change in the
conduct of the university, as for nearly
two years the trustees have had the
entire management of the properties.
Mrs. Stanford was a trustee and presi
dent of the board since the adjudicat
ing of matters connected with the
estate In the court*. Mrs. Stanford was
very active in the affairs of the school
and was constant]? advancing ideas.
When asked as to the theory that she
bad been poisoned. Mr. Leib said he
knew nothing of the case, and added:
"I can hardly believe that she used any
such expression as is quoted while she
was dying, because I cannot believe
any person would have any object in
having her life end. I would not like
to express any more on the subject un
til I know the attendant circumstances.
If she did give vent to any such ex
pression as is reported then I would be
â of the opinion that the circumstances
were such as would justify It. I never
knew Mrs. Stanford to maks? any re
marks which would not be entirely jus
tifiable for a reasonable person to
make."
A meeting of the board of trustees
will probably be called the last of this
week by Vice President Leib. He will
consult with some of the trustees to
morrow, but nothing has been decided
on. He said he presumed that Charles
Lathrop, Mrs. Stanford's brother, would
make, all the. arrangements for the fu
neral. Just what action will be taken
at the meeting of the trustees is not
known, and Leib says he has no Idea of
what will be done.

NOBLE DEEDS
DURING LIFE
Mrs. Stanford's Career
-Remarkable lor Love
and Devotion.
"I>eeds. not words," make arreat men
and women, too; and measured by
things accomplished Jane L. Stanford's
name stands and will long stand high
on the roll of great women, not only of
comparatively young California, but
back through the centuries. She was
classed by biographical writers as a
"philanthropist." and rightly so, in the
fullest sense of, the word; for she not
â¦>nly gave freely of the wealth that was
hrirs, but she took such an active part
in the application of her gifts as to en
title her to head a special class of bene
factors.
Many give largely to special projects
to be inaugurated after their decease:
others give great sums of money on the
same lines while yet alive, but little
of their time to the carrying- out of
the objects of their gifts.
It was not so with Mrs. Stanford.
Husband and wife mutually agreed
upon the great purpose which has done
sv much for ihe youth of California
and promises for the future so much
more, and they worked together toward
iff? early accomplishment until th*
death of the one in 1532 Mt the whole
burden on the other. That she met th*Â»
occasion in both intention and act the
history of Stanford University since
the death of Senator Stanford abund
antly proves.
The monument to their n*mes and
their beneficence, planned and put on
fcot by the two and carried .to ripe
and large potential by the survivor,
will ever mark the standard that well
seated devotion to a high purpose may
cittain.

One of the saddest incidents of the
tragic end of the benefactress of the
great university 13 the illness of ,'the : ;
Rev. B. Charles Gardner, chaplain of
the college and personal friend of the ;
dead woman. Dr. Gardner at the pres
ent time lies at death's door, Btricken

Dr. Gardner was takÂ»n 11! several!
days ago and soon his condition be
came serious. So low was he yesterday
that his physicians refused to allow,
the news of the death of Mrs. Stan
ford to be conveyed to him Jest the
shock might prove fatal. If a change
for the better comes to-morrow, the .
clergyman may be told of . the sad
news, but It Is unlikely "hat hia con
dition will warrant this. . â¢
It was one of Mrs. Stanford's re
quests that the rites over her remains
be performed by the chaplain of the
university to which she had devoted
her life and fortune to make one of the
greatest seat* of learning in the coun
try. From the present Indications-, It
would appear that this request can

DEATH OF SON

Inland Stanford Jr., in whose mem
or> th^ g-eat university was founded.
Jived to (he age of sixteen years. Etc
was bright, intelligent and affectionate
to an unusual degree. Both of his
parents id'llzei him. His every desire
was sai i-sfl iÂ»d. All things seemed propi
tious for his becoming a man who
would bÂ«- a credit to himself, his
friends and hi? country.
In the early eighties he took a trip
a"broad. The boy visited the various
European capitals and gathered many
mementoes of his trip, which are to
day preserved in the museum at the
urwv<=rsity. In ISM. whil< visiting at
Florence. Italy, he was suddenly taken
sick with Roman fever. Every pos
sible effort was made to save his life,
but in vain. A remarkable occurrence
is related in this connection.
When Governor Stanford was watch
ing by his child s bedside, wearied
with his prolonged vigils and constant
worry, he dropped asleep and dreamed
that his son said to him: "Father,
don't say you have nothing to live for,
you have a great deal to live for, live
for humanity, father."
\\ hile this droam was passing
through the great mans mind Leland
Stanford Jr. passed away.
Both parents were prostrated by the
death of their boy. Their grief was
never much lighter during life, for the
memory of the child was always with
them. The idea of founding the great
educational institution was conceived
shortly after the death of the son, but
efforts to perfect the plan were not
taken for several years.
DEATH RECALLS RECENT EVENT.
' Only a Month Ago Mrs. Stanford Eu.
tertained Old Sacramento
Friends.
No one received with keener feelings
of regret the sudden news of Mrs.
Stanford's death yesterday than her
late husbands friends, who, only a
menth ago, gathered at her magnificent
mansion on California street hill and
partook of the hospitality of a hostess
who they had known and loved for half
a century. Mrs. Stanford never forgot
the friends of early days in Sacramento
and especially those who graced her
social gatherings during the guberna
torial administration of her husband in
that city.
It was with the idea of reviving
pleasant memories of the past that Mrs.
Stanford recently gave an elaborate
dinner at her Callfornla-SLreet home to
her old associates in Sacramento, who
] carpe from near and far to brighten
the occasion, on which Mrs. Stanford
displayed her happiness in a manner
that will ever remain fresh in the
minfis of those who were chosen her
guests that evening. Fate had seem
ingly decreed that the event should be
the last function at which Mrs. Stan
ford should be the hostess. A few days
foHowing it she experienced a recur
rence of her affliction and
1 had to abandon several affairs that she
J had begun to make preparations for.
j Among these events Was to have been
the coming out of her favored niece,
Miss Jennie lAthrop, the daughter Of
I her brother, Charles Lathrop. The
i Stanford mansion was to ha,ve been
j thrown open to society, but illness
j compelled Its mistress to close the
hf use and prepare for a trip to the
Hawaiian Islands, where, instead of
finding relief, her death ensued in a
tragic manner.

IN HOTEL AT HONOLULU
Continued From Page I. Column 2.
I am so ill; get me a doctor â get me a
doctor . lat once summoned Dr. Hum- j
phris and he worked over her for sev- \
eral minutes, but to no avail."
Mrs. Stanford was apparently in the
best of health and spirits up to the i
time she was siezed with her fatal ill- j
ness. She partook of a hearty luncheon I
at noon and then went for a drive, j
Returning in the evening, she went to I
thf dining room, bijt refused to eat :
more than a plate of soup, saying she j
was not hungry after nrr hearty
lunch. She spent the evening in com
pany with her secretary, Miss Berner,
lounging on the veranda and retired
about 10 o'clock.
Miss Burner, who has been Mrs.
Stanford's secretary for more than
twenty years, made the following
statement to-night:
"We went to a picnic yesterday and
were planning to go to-day to Haleiwa,
a suburban resort. Our luncheon yes
terday consisted of the ordinary cold
dishes prepared at the Moana Hotel,
and there was nothing in It of the
canned variety. Mrs. Stanford ate
very heartily. She expressed great en
joyment in her trip and said she felt
very well.
"We returned to the hotel at 4 o'clock
and Mrs. Stanford retired to her room
for a rest. Later she dressed for din
ner. When the soup was served she
uaid that would be sufficient, as she
was not hungry. '
GROAXS BRING PROMPT AID.
'We then went to the veranda,
where Mrs. Stanford planned the trip
to Haleiwa for to-day. She then said
she would retire early so as to be re
freshed for the trip. At 8:30 Mrs.
Stanford cent for her maid. May Hunt,
whom she had recently employed. She
then said to me, 'I .shall retire and
take my medicine; please get it for
me.'
"I got half a teaspoonful of bicar
bonate of soda, one purgative tablet
and a bottle o/ Bartlett water. Mrs.
Stanford forgot to take the medicine
and lay down and slept. As soon as
the av.oke she took the medicine and
again retired.
A Mr3. Stanford soon thereafter was
seized with convulsions which threw
her out of bed. The maid and myself
came in answer to her call, as did also
a guest from a near-by room. She
said: "I am poisoned.'
"The convulsions continued In spite
of the efforts of the physician, and she
passed away in great agony."
Dr. Humphris says that death was
the result of tetanus of the. respiratory
organs, but Just what caused the teta
nus he is not able to determine till an
analysis of the contents of the stomach
has been made. Dr. Humphris seems
convinced in hia own mind that the
bicorbonate of soda which Mrs. Stan
ford took before retiring contained
strychnine. Hfe- made the following
statement to-night:
STRYCHNINE IN THE BQTTUE.
"When I was caHed in I found Mrs.
Stanford in convulsions and applied
the quickest remedies, but it waff riot
possible to save her life. Mrs.. Stan
ford said to mci
" "Doctor, I have, been poisoned.'
"Mrs. Stanford's condition seemed to
indicate .strychnine poisoning. Be
tween convulsions her mind was un
usually active and she said:
" 'This is the second time they have
tried it. They trted it last January
and I came here to avoid them.'
. ' "I tasted the contents of the bottle,"
continued Dr. Hamphris. . "Before
making an analysis. I am unable to
swear that it contains strychnine, but
I am perfectly positive that it does
j contain strychnine." â¢
Dr. Hujriphris appointed .former
Judge Stanley, a guest at the hotel,
to look after the dead woman's affairs
temporarily. He then cabled Professor

"If," said thÂ«Â» captain yesterday,
"Mrs. Stanford's death was due to
poison prepared for her in this city,
it is the duty of the department to

to arrest the poisoner. The dispatches
from Honolulu are- meager, but I will

the result of the autopsy as speedily
as possible so that I may have some
thing tangible to work upon. Mean

and Eventually Becomes

With Huntington and Hop
kins Accomplishes Feat
of Financiering.
The story of the making of the Stan
ford millions is typical of early Califor
nia. Iceland Stanford came to the State
in 1852, a poor lawyer. In 1861 he was
Governor of the State and president of
the company, that projected the first
transcontinental railway.
Stanford came West on the advice of
his brothers, who were ' conducting a
store |in Sacramento: The brothers
â grub-staked" him and the future rail
way magnate went to Michigan Bluff,
where he engaged in mining. He accu
mulated a little money, but tired of
mining and went back to work for his
brothers at Sacramento.
He took an active interest in politics
and was soon recognized as a leader.
He was a delegate to the National Con
vention of 1860 that nominated Presi
dent Lincoln. In 1861 he was elected
Governor of California.
Prior to 1861 Leland Stanford was
convinced of the feasibility of a trans
continental railway. He concentrated
his energies on the project and in 1861
was made president of the Central Pa
cific Railway Company.
The Legislature of the State granted
a charter for the line in California.
This was only part of the battle. The
support of the Federal Government was
needed, and it was obtained through
the persistence of Stanford. Collie P.
Huntington and Mark Hopkins.
Though the national credit was
stretched to the limit at the time, an
act of Congress appropriated and gave
to the company twenty miles of terri
tory along each side of the proposed
railway. The nation's credit was lent
to the scheme in the form of thirty-five
year bonds, the company agreeing to
pay $.15,000 a mile for every mile con
structed.
The work was done-in the face of in
numerable difficulties.
Material had to be brought "around
the Horn" at enormous cost. The
bonds issued for the work were only
recognized for a third of their face
value.
On May 20. 1869, Governor Stanford
with his own hands drove home the
last spike in the Central Pacific Rail
way and the silver hammer connected
by a wire with the telegraph systems
of the country flashed to the remotest
parts of the land the tidings that the
East and West were united by bands
of steel.
Shortly after the road was completed
the State gave the new company a
half million do'lars as a gift. Several
counties contributed sums that almost
aggregated a like sum.
Later Stanford took an interest in
shipping and became one of the larg
est shareholders In the Occidental and
Oriental steamship line. He was
elected president of the company and
retained that office until his death.
Stanford married Jane Lathrop while
he was a pennilese lawyer. The story
is that he borrowed $">0 of Charles Mil
ler of Port Washington, his counsin.
to defray his wedding expenses. Miss
Lathrop was the daughter of Dyer
Lathrop of Albany. New York.
Mrs. Stanford came across the plains
with her husband and endured with
him the hardships that all pioneers'
wives endured. A shrewd woman of
business herself she was often con
sulted by Governor Stanford and her
advice helped in the accumulation of
thÂ» Stanford millions.
Besides the railway interests the
Stanford estate includes some of the
finest vineyards in the State, horse
farms famous all over the world, a
country seat at Palo Alto and a
mansion at Powell and Sacramento
stpeets. The university property at
Palo Alto is valued at over $20,000,000.
SYMPATHY FOR MISS BERNER.
The news received here late yester
day to the effect that the police of
Honolulu had deemed it advisable to
place under surveillance Miss Bertha
Berner and May Hunt, private secre
tary and maid, respectively, of Mrs.
Stanford, provoked much comment
among the friends of the deceased wo
man. To these friends ft is well known
that Mrs. Stanford had no more faith
ful friend than Miss Berner, who had
been her secretary for many years and
is supposed to be a beneficiary under
the uftl of the philanthropic lady.
Miss Berner has a mother and lis
ter living at Palo Alto. They moved
there in order to be close to their
relative whenever the* latter wai a vis
itor to Palo A!to with Mrs. Stanford.
It would be a difficult matter to find
among the late Mrs. Stanford's many
friends one who would suspect that
Miss Berner's mind ever entertained a
disloyal thought for her mistress,
even should it be possible that the
I latter had been the victim, of. poison-.
I ing, and the deepest sympathy is ex
pressed here for the unfortunate
woman who has been subjected to
surveillance at a time when .she is
grieving over the death of a friend
who had at. all times reposed in her
the greatest confidence.

announcing- the death of former
United States Senator Edward O.
Wolcott, who has been sojourning in
France, was received to-night at the

France. While the cablegram did not
give the real cause of hia death, it is
known that he had suffered from
stomach trouble foÂ» a number of years,
years.
The news of Senator Wolcott's
death came as a shock to the resi
dents of this city, where his long pub
lic service had made his name a
household word. Politicians now
gathered in this city, attracted by the
gubernatorial contest, forgot the con
test for a time and the one topic of
discussion was the Senator's death and
the possible result it would have on
the political hituation In Colorado,
where he had been a recognized
leader for more than a score of years.

Norman desired to have his prisoners

raised a storm of protest from the

what Judge Ogden declared yesterday
seemed a palpable forgery. Testi
mony introduced at this morning's

veloped a glaring irregularity of pro
ceeding.
In order to draw some $1100 from

debased James O'Hanlon took an
assignment of the book to a notary
public in San Francisco and had a
plain cross identified as his sisters
signature. The witnesses were her

friend by the name of Mrs. Alice Cum
mings. Mrs. Cummings said to-day
that she supposed she was simply tep.
tifying to the death of her friend and
had no idea that O'Hanlon could draw
any money on the book. On the as
signment were the names of James
( 'Hanlon snd that of his sister, which
Judge Ogden derided were in O'Han

MUNICIPAL LEAGUE
FAVORS PLANT.
PURER SUPPLY OF WATER
BAY CITIES COMPANY OFFERS
SYSTEM TO OAKLAND PEOPLE
OAKLAND. March I.â The Municipal
League to-night at Hamilton Hall
heard a presentation of the Bay Cities
Water Company's project to supply the
city water, the question which is to be
submitted to popular vote March 11.
Cary Howard, president of the league,
was chairman. Illness prevented Wil
liam S. Tevis, Dresident of the Bay
Cities Company, from attending.
Mayor Warren Olney, the first speaker,
outlined the conditions which he de
clared had led up to the question of
a municipal water supply and said:
I, m you all know, was tn favor of buying
the Contra. Costa plan; If It could be pur
chased at a reasonable figure. Th" plant, afc
cording to the estimate of competent engineers,
is not worth more than $4,000,000. but I do
not believe we should double this figure for a
worn-out distributing sy*tem. The worry of
litigation and the constant frlrtion between
the Contra Costa Wat"- Company and the
people win never end until trie city buys its
own plant.
These conditions make it necessary for uÂ« to
do something and the most feasible plan is the
purchase of the system now offered to us by
thfÂ» Bay Cities Water Company, When this la
.completed It will. be. -an entirely new system.

The fact that the full news of Ala

I forth numerous compliments at the
' meeting of the Merchants' Exchange
Jof this city held last night. That The

notes in a separate edition, which can
only be obtained in a small area, was

Sacramento that gave full and de
tailed accounts of all Alameda County
happenings.
W. H. Weilbye, one of Alameda
County's commissioners at the St.

through The Call he was able to keep

ers, told how The Call was the only
San Francisco paper kept on file at
the Alameda County exhibit, for the
reason that it was virtually demanded
by all visitors from Oakland and vi
cinity, who were, ot ' course, anxious
to keep in touch with their homes.
President E. Jonas of the Mer
chants' Exchange complimented The
Cafl on the fact that by running the
Alameda County page through all edi

j the county before the public. He said
j that many . residents of Oakland and
i suburbs, who were In business in San
Francisco, welcomed the fact that in
The Call, a.s delivered at their of
fices in San Francisco, they could ob
tain full notes of all that went on in
their home city. He also said that he
was shortly to take a. trip tb the East

NOT CLEAR TO THE COURT
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Claud Anderson, a dapper little tailor
whose dialect. betrayed. Teutonic nativ
.ity. pleaded not guilty to the charge of
malicious mischief filed against him by
the night clerk of a lodging-house at
523 Kearny street. The clerk averred
that Mr. Anderson deliberately drove
his clenched fist through a large pane
of glass, and Mr. Anderson, while.ac
knowledging the deed, emphatically de
nied that it was maliciously committed*
He had witnessed the Nelson-Corbett
battle, he said, and it was while illus
trating the manner in which the terri
ble Dane had put the E>enverite out of
commlssion that his hand accidentally
collided with the pane.
"Id vas a yhord-arm cholt mid mine
right dot smeshed der gless," he ex
plained to Police Judge Mogan. "Yen
I earned hime from der fighd der
beoples eskt me how dot Nelson yon
id und I vos showin' dem der way in
; vlch Nelson schwung der left und den
j brought oier der augshuneer to dot
Corbett's chaw yen mine righd hend
Fchmeshed der pane. Id vas aggidental
dot I did id. Der ghsa reflected me
und I used id as a ittlrror yen I vas

Nelson hed yen he vas deliverin' dose
goots ter Corbett. Den yen I com
menced der shatow-poxLn' I got so ox
cided dot I forgod all abouid der gless,
und yen I brouglid ofer mine righd mid
dat knock-ovid chab der demmege hep
pens."
"In other words," suggested the
[court, palpably moved to admiration
I by Mr. Anderson's profound knowledge
,i)t prize-ring: technique, "in other
i words, you knocked out the pane?"
"Dot vas Id knocked ovid der pane,
und ad d^r same dime'- cut mine hand."
But the night clerk insisted that Mr.
Anderson, although extremely elated
by winning certain bets which he had
made Â«ii Nelson, was fully conscious of
v.hat he was doing when he shattered
the Â£la-Â«s. "Hurrah fer dot Beddlin
Nelson:" Mr. Anderson was alleged to
have shouted as he danced and ducked
and feinted at his reflection in the pane,
and it was reported also that prior to
delivering the damaging blow he
yelled. "Come on, ye Denfer shtiff;
Phtand oop und dake yer medicine like
yon leedle shendlemans."
As several spectators of the shadow
boxing were ready to corroborate the
clerk's version of the incident, the
Judge pronounced Mr. Anderson guilty
and remanded him for sentence.
Mrs. Ella Roessing, accused of peace
disturbance by Mrs. Marian L. West
of 2W Natoma street, told Judge
Cabaniss that she was provoked to
ang-er by the complainant's unjust al
lusions to the histrionic ability and
social standing of her (Mrs. Roessing's)
sixteen-year-old daughter. Although it
was well known throughout the neigh
borhood that Miss Roes?ing was one of
the most talented and respectable
artistes now appearing at the Grand
, Opera-house. Mrs. "West endeavored to
belittle the young lady's prestige by
circulating the canard that she was
merely a "supe," and a "back-row"
supe at that. In this libelous work,
Mrs. Roessing further averred, Mrs.
West was unquestionably aided and
abetted by Mrs. Mulligan, whom she
(Mrs. Roessing) saw there in court and
who would probably be called by the
1 prosecution. It wae a sad commentary
on human nature, Mrs. Roessing de
clared, that no sooner does a person
begin to rise In the world than other
persons attempt to impede the ascen
sion, althougrh by so doing they cannot
possibly elevate themselves. But,
thank goodness. Miss Roessing would
continue to go onward and upward to
fame and fortune, despite what reck
, lees tongues, inspired by malicious
hearts, might do with intent to draff
her down.
Mrs. Roessing's reference to Mrm
i Mulligan's presence in court and its
probable object had desired intlmi
datory effect, for that lady wae not
called to testify. But the prosecution
did summon one Benrrle Hevey to the
witness stand, and was sadly dis
gruntled when the spectacled young
man 'vho responded glanced ahrlnking
ly at Mrs. Roesfling and then declared
that he knew nothing about the case
and had nothing to say.
"And it's well for you, Bennie Hevey,
that you haven't," ejaculated Mrs.
Roessing, "for If I cut loose a-tellrn'
what I know about youâ but never
mind."
It then developed that Mr. Hevey
had said, or was reported to ha.ye said,
that Mrs. Roessing had served, three
months' imprisonment for. disturbing
the peace And that she was a neighbor
hood pest. Under a sharp examination
i Mrs. Roessing gradually Confessed that
had been incarcerated ior the of
fense and for the period mentipned, so
s-he was promptly adjudped. guilty of
the misdemeanor charged by Mrs.
West. Sentence to-day. . â¢

When the case of the People vs. Wil
liam Frix, disturbing the peace, was
called in Judge Fritz's court, a tall

shouted: . .
"He has no attorney, and it ain't fair
to try him without' one. ' I move fpr a
continuance."
; When the shock conveyed to the bail
j iffs by such an untoward proceeding

the bench, "despite the fact that- you
have not formally been admitted to the
bar."
â¢ â¢ â¢
Judge Cabaniss visited somewhat
similar penalty on Mrs. Antoinette
Pericorne, who accused Mrs. Vincent
at 732 Vallejo of having disturbed the
peace. Mrs. Pericorne averred that
Mrs. Vincent called her uncompli
mentary names, and â  Mrs. Vincent
swore that Mrs. Pericorne willfully in
flicted innumerable annoyances on .the
Vinrerit household. Mrs." Vincent was
released on her own recognizance and
Mrs. Perioorne was advised to estab
lish her home in some other locality as

His craving for oysters. Charles Blno'
said, was both extraordinary and in
appeasable. While appetite for the bir
\-alves is. usually acquired-, his is .in
herent. From babyhood he had con
stantly yearned for oysters, and grat
ification of his gastronomic desire had
kept. him. a pauper. Yes, he had heard
of Charles Lamb's famous Baying
to the effect that 'the ..bra vest man v.ho
ever lived was he who first swallowed
in oyster, but in. his (Mr. Bino's) case
superhuman courage' was required to
eschew eatine: oysters.' The suffering
ho has undergone during the oysteriess
months baffles description! While the
rest of humankind looks forward to win

first of September as the bride-elect
greets her wedding morn or the ma
rooned mariner welcomes an oncoming

It was in the court of Judge Conlan
that ilr. Bino thus endeavored to pro
voke cojidonement of his consumption
of $4.35 worth of .oysters in a Stockton
street cafe and then informing the ca
terer that he was unable to pay for
the feast; A waiter and a cook testi
fied that Mr. Bino opened his perform
ance at table by gulping a full stew,
after which he enveloped, in the order
given, a dozen large Easterns on the
half-shell, a like number of small East
erns in bulk, a pint of natives unshell

Mrs. Agnes Sterling of 1115 Clay
street averred her ability to get along
amicably with her landlady, Mrs. Ber
tha Simeon, but when Mrs. Simeon and
Mrs. Rogers and Miss Mitchell put their
heads together and talked about her
and to her it was more than she could
passively endure, inasmuch as she was
not a saint on earth. If she had said
anything in retaliation it was no more
than a temporal angel would have
done, and the charge of peace disturb
ance filed against her by Mrs. Simeon
was. therefore, rather uncalled for, as
Judge Mogan would surely opine if he
understood the circumstances.
Mrs. Simeon then testified that foe
three months she had been trying to
force Mrs. Sterling out of 1115, because
of the truculent character of that lady.
A rent Increase from $40 to $75 a month
did not have the desired effect, al
though how Mr. Sterling managed to
meet the raise was more than she
could understand. Did the undesirable
tenant use offensive language? Lan
guage was no name for it She simply
said â¢vexythln#r of ah offensive kind
that she could lay her tongue to.
Moreover Mr. Sterling had said that
his wife had him "buffaloed," thereby
unquestionably meaning that he waa
henpecked to complete eubmissiveness.
Mrs. Sterling was given twenty-four
hours in which to Vacate Mrs. Simeon's
flat.

an Accident on a Steep

PORTLAND, March 1. â One woman
and six men were more or less seri
ously injured to-day whe"n a runaway
freight car. ,on the Oregon Wafer
Power and "Railway Company's line
cpllided with a combined mail and
passenger car from Cazadero. When
ascending Boring Hill, a steep grade
near Barton station, the motorman of
â¢the mail car observed a runaway
freight car descending at a furious
pate of speed* ' He quickly reversed
the motors. The descent tiad begun
and considerable speed had been
gained before' the* inevitable collision
took place.
â¢There were a number of passengers
in the forward section of the car,
and being warned of the impending
danger, several had passed into the
mail comoartment before the crash
came. One end of the mail car and
the freight car were wrecked, but the
presence of mind of the motorman
prevented serious injury to the pas
sengers. . .
FIERCE BATTLE
OVER CROSSING
Petaluma Electric and the
California Northwestern
3kn Fight in Santa Rosa
SpÂ«clal Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SANTA ROSA, March I.â For six
hours to-day several hundred men faced
each other with crowbars, picks, shovels
and fought while they pried and dug
at the rails. It was at the Sebastopol
avenue crossing when the Petaluma
and Santa Rosa Electric Railway force
attempted to cut the California North
western rails and cross into the city.
The Northwestern people were on hand
to prevent the work. They succeeded
Until a restraining order arrived and
they were forced to withdraw. This
left a clear field for the electric people
and they built the crossing during the
night. As a result of the battle several
men were hurt and several arrests
were made.
This morning Judge J. M. Seawell of
San Francisco dissolved the injunction
against the electric line and both sides
gathered for the conflict. The North
western ran two locomotives and sev
eral flat care on to the crossing where
the electric force was sawing the rails.
The two gangs of men fought each
other with their implements, and rocks.
While the men dtnj at the rails their
opponents, threw sand on them. The
engines were specially fitted with steam
pipes through which hot steam was
thrown on the men at work.
DLreotor Frank Brush qf thÂ© electrlo
railway lay on the ground in front of
a Northwestern locomotive as it was
moving down to obstruct the crossing
artd 'stopped it, the engineer not daring
to - run over and crush him. Two
wagons were driven on to the crossing
and' were wrecked between the two
locomotives as they came down the
track in opposite directions.
Warrants were subsequently served
on Superintendent Hunter, Chief Engi
neers Zook and Barrows and a number
of. Northwestern employes, charging
them with obstructing the work of the
electric road. Superintendents Thorn
ton and Fairchild and General Passen
ger Â»Agent H. H. Huntington and a
nvrtnber of other officials were arrested
on other charges,
Afrout 5 o'clock in the afternoon
President Foster arrived on a special
train with 150 employes as reinforce
ments' for the fight. It looked as
though the ."conflict would grow more
serious when a restraining order ar
rived from' Judge J. Seawell in San
Francisco. It enjoined the California
Northwestern from interfering with the
electric road at the crossing and was
made -returnable on Monday. Foster
immediately called off his men. ordered
the locomotive to haul the cars away
and the day's war was ended.
'To.-night the electric workmen put
down their rails and made the cross
ing.
Route for New Road.
MARYSVILLE, March 1. â The
route for the proposed electric railway
from Grass VaUey to Marysville is now
pretty well established. An engineer
ing party Is now working northwest
from Spencerville toward thÂ« Tuba
River dredge mining tract and the
lines have already been run nearly
that far. . . Thence. It is. expected the
road will follcrw the south side of the
river to Marysville. John Martin of
San Francisco Is believed, to be pro
moting the enterprise, but the engl
nc-ers refuse to state by whom they
are employed.

THE DEATH OF MRS. STANFORD.
CALIFORNIA cannot be indifferent to the passing away of the :
last member of the immediate family of Senator Stanford. :
The economic and tchnlastic features in the history of this j
*â¢ the last forty years get their zest and interest very largely.;
:be personality and the acts of Leland Stanford and his wife.!
v were essentially American in feeling and sentiment, and the
potent of everything in which either or both were concerned
On lines consistent with our national genius.
He starred in life as a country lawyer in Wisconsin, with an I
>mic education, and as she stood faithfully by his side in the j
â  beginning of his career, so she faithfully followed the tin- j
ng of that career to itÂ« last and highest development. They were j
' vrHiem representative* of that American character that is j
ri the Middle State*. Roth natives of Xew York, they were j
â¢ and reared in the midst of rural surroundings and took nothing !
nd owed nothing to the inspirations of city life. They both J
! very closely to the wholesome ideaH and habits of the up-!
V" x -risers. They loved education and their fellows, and
1 had that spirit of enterprise which has made this foremost j
â¢ c the nations. When he sought to make real the dream of a j
â  railway it is Known that she loyally and, in her way, j
:>orted his exertions in the overcoming of physical difficulties and
â¢ructions which had appalled the engineers of every country.
It is easy now to build railways across the continent. Every
Hem of c i:c h construction has been solved. But it was a quite
r -rent task when the pioneer builders faced the problem and
solved it by hard work and hard knocks. The risks were great, and
when the modest fortune, won in commerce, with which her husband
gM the great work, seemed all engulfed in the doubtful enter
se; it is known that she never quailed nor repined, but urged him
to go forward and persist. Whatever he gained from his associates
in that work has been frankly admitted, but men know little of what
gained from his unfailing persistence, patience and determina-
In all this the wife had her part and sustained it loyally. When
â  came, and great gains with it, and the little fortune had
'len into millions, neither of them lost simplicity of life and
fiabits. True, they had vast possessions and many mansions, and
were surrounded by all the evidences of riches and good taste. But
they occupied it, moved in the midst of it and enjoyed it without any
pride of possession or the ostentation of ownership. In his i
life and hers there is every evidence that they treated their posi
145 a stewardship, of which account must be rendered.
In the midst of their progress in materialities there came into
their middle life the illumination of a great joy in the birth of their
only child and son. Thenceforward the sun shone where he stood,
and all the hope and pleasure and pride of life focused upon him.
â¢ need not go to the abandon of parental grief and its ascriptions
now that he grew to be a lad of fine mental quality and promise.
His training was wisely begun and he promised to prow in physical
intellectual qualities of great beauty and strength. In the most
interesting period of his youth this H^ht was stricken and quenched,
and all the shining paths that radiated from it were darkened. His
death, untimely, was a blow to his father and mother that sadly un
;ed both. The pood world seemed to drop away into space and
leave them nothing to cling to in their sorrow and despair.
It iÂ« a great law of life that out of capital misfortunes come
blessing and benefit. This father and mother sat desolate in the
midst of their wealth and decided to coin it all into a blessing to
the world in the name of their dead. Out of that noble sorrow issued
Leland Stanford Jr. University. The Senator rallied and put into
the planning- of that institution all of the best business ability that
had gone into his constructive enterprises. Sighting backward for
the best examples and models that might be useful, his foresight
penetrated the future and made in every detail provision fitted to
every possible contingency and emergency that in all the years to
come might occur in the operation of the institution. In the midst
of this congenial work he fell, and his widow, with the spirit of her
|d upon her. gathered into her hands every thread of the great
work, and it wen* on. Their joint fortune endowed it, and the lone
liness of all the years of her widowhood was banished by ceaseless
activity in order that as much as possible of the great plan might
have being while she lived. Nature was kind to her, and before her
vision closed here, to reopen in the presence of the loved of her
heart, it had rested upon the near completion of the world's greatest
*eat of learning. Most of it grew under her hand, and every fea
ture of the great original plan, in all the beauty and utility in which
ay in the brightest dream of its two projectors, is provided for and
assured.
The last of the founders is no more. But the foundation is as
immortal as learning and letters, and the chord in their hearts struck
by sorrow, turned to a note of triumph, will sing joy to the world in
; countless lives ennobled by what they did. Her death takes the last
: of; two great citizens from California, and this commonwealth will
"â¢' never forget to embellish their memories with its praise and thanks

SMALL ADS REACH HIGH WATER MARK.
S\TY-R)l"R and a half columns of small ads was the record
made by The Call in its Sunday issue. February 26. This
record establishes in The Call a new high water niark for this
class of advertising and is convincing evidence of the popular es
teem in which The Call is held by "small ad" patrons.
The "Classified," "Want Ad" or "Small Ad" (whichever phrase
- prefers to denote this style of advertising) is that department
of a newspaper which is in reality the great clearing-house for the
â blic wants and as such becomes one of the most important func
am of a daily newspaper. No other department comes closer to
>Ã¼bhc and in no other way may a newspaper demonstrate a
re practical teroce to its patrons than to become the medium
satisfies their urgent wants or necessities. In a great measure
newspaper's success is evidenced by thÂ« popularity eg its "small
ad" department. At no time in th< history of The Call has any
issue of the paper contained such a quantity of small ads as ap
peared last Sunday. Over 3500 people visited its btiness office
leaving thetr copy for ads to appear in that issue, and over nine
eres (seven columns to the page) were required to accommodate
the matter.
The conclusion to be drawn from this evidence of popular esteem
is that The Call brings results to its advertisers. To do that the
paper must be read by the right class of people, viz., those who read
advertising and having read are influenced by it and respond Call
ads are notorious result getters.

WELCOME CUPID IN YOUR HOME
Parents Should Realize That Youth Is the Season of Love and
Pleasure
I WANT to make a plea for romance
in the home and for love making
as a parlor paslime. I want to say
to parents who have young daugh
ters that it is" a poor policy to
thrust Cupid into the street when he
knocks at the portals of your family
peace. Give him, instead, a fireside
'â orner, lest, shivering and homeless,
he seeks some glittering refuge where
he will become a glowing god of wine
and wanton laughter.
When you shut the door in love's
face you make of him an enemy in
ambush: Invite him in and treat him
like a gentleman and he v. ill. become
a household friend. ' â¢
Why is the debased dance hall such
a menace to the morality of our
cities? Because it is a modern min
otaur which ; feeds upon the life of
msiirienhood. Why do so many fair
young girls hold cheap their price
less gift of innocence? Chiefly for
these, pi-mple -reasons: The nature of
the heart of youth and lack of under
standing of it in the home.
Girls do not go to the dance hall
the first time, or for many a time sub
sequently, because they are depraved,
because they like the taste of liquor,
or because they wfint to behave them
selves in an. unseemly manner. They
go there from the same -motive that
a debutante goes to a ball-^they are
eager to have a good time. They revel
in the music and the light, the atten
tions of youner men and the delicious
sense of freedom that comes oi! mov
ing lightly in response to tuneful
rhythm.
Youth is the season of love and
pleasure. Whither these allurements
beckon, youth .will sigh to go, and the
BY LONG DISTANCE PHONE
* / J you see some one had to
stay at home," came the
V-} voice over the wire, and I
telephoned Gertie Bryan that
I would not come until to-morrow."
"I'm sorry," answered Gerald Hol
land. "There was something I par
ticularly wanted to say to you."
'Well," provpkingly.
"Cannot I come out?"
"No," this with a little shriek. "It
would not be proper. You see, I am
entirely alone."
"Even the servants gone out?" he
demanded.
Enid Allen gave a little laugh. "I
forgot to teli you. The cook and the
first girl went on strike this afternoon.
They thought 1 could not get along
without them, and I let them go, just
to show them that I could. Then the
coachman get drunk and I had to dis
miss him.
"Why can't you go to Mrs. Carter's
for the night?" he suggested.
"There's an awful lot of money In
the safe," she answered. "I've got to
stay here and look after it. You see,
father will need it to-morrow and
won't have time to draw it when he
gets back here."
"Have you any means of protec

"I've got that revolver I used in

come." . . . '
"I'm glad of that," he began, "but I

There came over the wire a suc
cession of wild shrieks, the sound of a
heavy fall, a shot, more shrieks, a sec
ond crash and then silence.
Frantically he shouted into the
transmitter, but no answer came nor
could he hear a sound. He dashed
the receiver upon the hook and rushed
across the room, tearing off the house
coat he had been wearing over his
evening clothes.
Even in his terror and despair his
mind acted quickly and he deter
mined to go out to drestrliff. The
Aliens had a handsome country home
on the share of the lake. It was only
ten miles from the city and Holland

In less than five minutes he had
donned furs, a leather cap and gog

miles out the city Jine was passed and
he threw the lever over to the Tiighest

the big car shot ahead.

overpower the weak girl.
Under his breath he prayed that hÂ«
might not be too late, but his fears
had hold of him, and, in spite of the
rapid rush through the cold night, the
perspiration stood out upon his fore
head.
He had hoped to see her at the
Bryans' party that evening and it was
the announcement that she would not
be there that had led him to call up
Enid on his early return from the
dinner which .'had preceded the dance.
He thought as he rushed along that
he would have asked her to be his
v.ifo that evening. Now he wondered
if h* would find her lying mortally
wounded upon the floor. Had she
shot the burglar she would have an
swered. The shot must have been
meant for her.
In less than twenty minutes he had
covered the ten miles, and stopped the
car before the big gates of the park
in which the Allen house sat. It
â would be better, he argued, to gain
access to the house quietly. Possibly
the assassin had not yet left the place.

Their recollection of Courting days is

settled down to a belief that bread

for everybody. They nurse the feeling
that the home which they have earned
by toil and self-denial belongs first of
all to them.

found a door unlocked and softly en
tered. The telephone, he knew, was
in the hall on the second floor, and
thither he directed his steps, but as
he passed the library he saw through
the open door a man stooping over the
safe, apparently at work on the com
bination.
Before he could make a spring the
figure started up, and Gerald found
himself looking down the barrel of a
dainty revolver â the very weapon he i
remembered having seen Enid use the
Bummer before in camp at Indian Is
land; the one she had told him she
would use for her protection. This
man must have taken it from her body.
Unmindful of the consequences, he
made a leap and caught at the hand
holding the weapon.
There was a flash, a report, and a
light blow on the arm. Then came a
stinging sensation in the right arm,
and just as the blood, running down
the sleeve reddened the hand, tho
burglar, with an entirely feminine
shriek, dropped to the floor.
The soft hat fell off and great masses
of dark brown hair, released from
confinement, framed Enid's face. There
was water and spirits on the table,
and hastily tying his handkerchief
about his arm Gerald knelt beside the
limp figure and forced some brandy
between her clenched lips.
In a moment she opened her eyes,
regarding him dreamily. "What are |
you doing here?" she asked. Then, as
it all came back to her, "Have T killed
you?"
"Just a little flesh wound." he said,
reassuringly. "It's nothing serious.
But how do you come to be in this
guise? I thought they had killed you."
"It was a mouse," she confessed,
shamefacedly. "I was talking to you
and a great big mouse ran across ths
floor toward me. I threw the tele
phone book at it and broke & va.se. but
it only ran toward me. I Jumped on a
chair and fired my revolver at it. I
was so scared I did not know what I
was doing."
"But the crash right afterward?" he
asked.
â¢"I fell off the chair and struck my
head against a corner,. It stunned me
for a while, and when I could get back
to the telephone you had gone."
"But how about the clothes?"
"Why. I thought there might be rmn
hanging around, so I put on father's
old coat and hat and went oat on the
porch so that if there were burglars
Â«bnut th-^y would think it was a man."
She opened the coat to show the
dainty house gown beneath, and in
spite of the burning of his arm he had
to smile. "Then I came in and you
mistook me for a burglar," he laughed.
"That cap looked like a mask," she
said defensively.
"I never thought of that," he sx
claimed, "and you had your coat collar
turned up so that It looked like a dis
guise. Well, you've captured me, al
though I'm no burglar, and you've got
to keep me now."
She looked tenderly up from the arm
she was dressing. Forever." she
-whispered. â Copyright, 1906, by P. C

SALLY SHARP
Beauty in bewitching floral garb,
heightened by glow of soft varied
lights, surrounded the ball given last
evening by Mr. and . Mrs. William
Tevis.
Especially for the affair a pavilion
had been erected bet^e^n the dining
room and ballroom, semblance to an
Italian garden controlling the entire
scheme. Through lattice work trailed
flowers and greens, graceful. and abun
dant. Locust blossoms, azaleas, ferns
and smilax luxuriantly made their
presence known. In the midst a foun
tain splashed, while all about were
marble seats. The reproduction well
emulated the original ami with the
glint of fair gowns gliding to music's
measure, the scene was one oi foreign
splendor, tmlike any yet given in this
city, even among the several functions
embracing originality. Two hundred
and fifty guests were entertained by
Mr. and Mrs. Tevls, who, before open
ing the ball, were guests at a dinner
given by Dr. Harry Tevis in honor of
Mrs. Augustus Spreckels. Others in
vited to meet Mrs. Spreckels were:
Mr. and Mrs. William G. Irwin. Mr.

Mrs. J. Downey Harvey, Mr. and Mrs.

The wedding of Miss Florence Steck
and Rollin C. Ayres took place last
evening at the home of the brtde's
mother on Geary street.
Dispensing with the conventional
white robe, the bride's blonde fairness
showed to advantage in pale blus chif
fon over silk of the same hue. She car
ried bride roses.
Attending was Miss Helen Carroll,
who, as maid of honor, was gowned m

An ovent of importance took place
last evening when Mr. and Mrs. \V.
Ford Thomas celebrated their golden
wedding. Nearly four hundred guests
gathered to offer congratulations and
homage tv the couple, who are still

alone in the meantime. Living for sev
eral years in Sierra County, he finally
came to San Francisco and was for
many years Deputy Collector of Cus
toms at this port. Ever since the first
of Cleveland's administration Mr.
Thomas, having resigned, has been in
the employ of the John D. Spreckels &
Bros. Co. as their customs attur
ney. There are three living children,
Harry Thomas, Kate Thomas and Mrs.
H. C. SheetE, at whose home last
night's memorable affair occurred.

SPOTS ON SUN
CAUSE TROUBLE
ON THE EARTH
The coincidence of widespread mag
netic disturbance at times of sunspot
maxima, and a corresponding decline
as sunspot minima set in, according to
the well known eleven year cycle, was
po frequently demonstrated during the
nineteenth centry that it is now a
recognized scientific fact that there is
some connei tion between the two
phenomena. Repeatedly, too, the
aurora borealis has glimmered over
head in apparent sympathy with the
mysterious alliance. So far, neither the
astuteness of Arrhenius nor the genius
of Lord Kelvin has been able to ex
plain the â  thereal bond. Indeed, many
years ago the last named physicist con
sidered chance to be the Invisible fac
tor, but several of the great solar
storms of recent times, with accom
panying magnetic disaster, gave added
weight to the theory of connection,
which is now an established but un
explained fact, despite the drawback
that magnetic storms sometimes occur
when the sqn's surface is serenely
white, and that enormous spots appear
when electrical conditions are normal.
This seems to be the case in the past
gix weeks, when three spots have
crossed the disk visible to the naked
eye. Magnetic disturbance limited to
one locality has been heard of, but
the absence of widespread effects Is
noticeable. This, however, cannot un
link the accumulated evidence of more
than one hundred years.
The large spot now near the center
of the disk appeared on Feb
ruary 25.. in nearly its present dimen
sions of 83,000 miles in length. It is not
a return of the great spot which was
central in the beginning of February,
though it happens to be also in south
heliographic latitude fifteen degrees
and is similar in aspect. There is a
difference of about forty degrees irt
their longitude. The zone it occupies
is well known as the most fruitful area
of solar tempests, especially during the
last twenty-five years. Sunspot max
ima are rarely as much in evidence
durmg a short period as at the present
time. ROSE O'HALLORAN.
STRANGER IS ROBBED IN
FRONT OF HAUL. OF JUSTICE
Thomas James of Petaluma Loses His
Coin and William H. Hogan
Is Placed Under Arrest.
William H. Hogran, who gives his
occupation as a hostler, was arrested
yesterday morning: on Sacramento j
street near Kearny by Detective Ed I
Gibson and booked at the City Prison
on a charge of robbery. The. com
plaining witness against him is Thorn- I
as James of Petaluma.
On the night of February ?6 James '
was passing the corner of Washing- I
ton and Kearny streets, almost oppo- i
site the Hall of Justice, when Hogan !
approached him and said": "Give me |
enough coin to get a bed, see." James i
replied: "I don't know you and I need |
all the money for myself." Hogan ut- !
tered an oath and quickly placing his i
arm. under James' chin forced his;
head back and grabbed James' gold i
watch out of his pocket.
James reported the robbery to the i
police and Gibson was detailed .on the
case. Prom a description that James I
gave of the robber Gibson arrested
Hogan yesterday. When Hogan was
searched at the City Prison a pawn

and Gibson recovered it from the

Professor C. G. Paterson
Speaks on the Subject of
the Pathos of Progress
An Influential body of men met yes
terday at the opening of the third an
nual conference of the Alumni of San
Francisco Theological Seminary, San
Anselmo. The Rev. H. N. Bevier pre
sided over the morning session and the
Rev. Herbert E. Hayes at the after
noon deliberations. The'fÃculty present
were the Rev. John Samuel Macintosh,

Mackenzie, D. D., Rev. Thomas Frank
lin Day, D. D., Rev Warren Hall Lan
dnn. D. D., Rev. Hugh Gilehrist, M. A.,
and Rev. Charles Gordon Paterson,
B. A.
Professor Paterson, In speaking of
"The Pathos of Progress," said in part:
Progress is the law of life in the physical,
mental and spiritual realm. In the physical
realm the marvelous accomplishments of th<;
men of science have given new meaning t>>
the words of Jesus. The Archbishop of Canter
t>ur3 - eairt during his recent memorable visit
to the United States that the student of the
olcgy must follow all kimls of scientific ad
vance with alert interest and without jealousy,
suspicion or alarm.
The law of progress holds also In the higher
El heres of m!nd and character. In all pro
gress there is not only pleasure but pathos.
In the physical sphere the pathos consists in
the terrible price of pain and blood paid for
Hit- progress attained.
The world is moving to an age in which
greater liberty of Judgment will be united with
more loyaJ obedience to accepted authority.
President Macintosh gave a pictur
esque account of "Some Great Euro
pean Preachers of the Last Century";
the Rev. Frank Rhoda's subject was
"Blood Atonement in the Book of He
brews"; the Rev. W. Stuart Wilson
epoke on "The Pastor as a Bible
Teacher." and the Rev. Arthur Hicks
on "Young People in Organized Church
Work."
The session will continue throughout
to-day and this evening and to-mor
row.
BOARD OF WORKS WANTS
A STEEL FOOTBRIDGE
Directs Santa Fe Company to Build
Permanent Structure on Twen
tieth Street.
The Board of Works yesterday di
rected the Santa Fe Railway Company
to construct a steel wagon and foot
bridge on Twentieth street between
lowa and Tennessee. A resolution
previously adopted by the Supervis
ors gives the company five years' time
to build the bridge and requires it to
maintain a temporary wooden bridge
in the meantime. The Board of Works
thinks a permanent steel structure
should be built as incidental to the
proposed grade changes in the Nuevo
Potrero district.
A delegation from the Potrero Im
provement Club addressed the board
in behalf of its petition thax Kentucky
street be kept in a cleanly condition;
that the Santa"Fe Company -be re
quired to grade lowa street from
Twenty-second to Scotch HJII and in
stall proper drainage facilities in the
territory between Twenty-third and
Army streets, which is now a stag
nant pool. The board decided to visit
the localities complained of to-raor
row at 9 a. m.
Bids were ordered invited for the
grading find widening 0/ Cliff avenue
from the Great Highway to the Cliff
House, so a concrete parapet may be
built thereon. Bids were also invited
for repairs to bituminous pavements
on a number of streets, as published
in yesterday's Call.
Arthur Dudley Cross was appointed
assistant engineer at ?150 per month.
Commissioner Aigeltinger stated
that a conference would be held next
Saturday morning with Herbert E.
Law and J. C. Kirkpatrlck relative to
the paving of Market street, for which
bonds were purchased.
â¢Jake" Raver asked the board to
fix his bond for blasting a lot on Ellis
street between Gough ajid Octavia,
for which he was granted a permit by
the Supervisors' Street Committee.
The Commissioners thought a large
bond should be exacted, Eagan saying
facetiously it should be a million dol
lars, and Maestretti holding out for
$100,000. They will visit the place be

GRIFFITH HILL
GO TO PRISON
Supreme Court Decides That
the Los Angeles Mil
lionaire Must Serve Time
TRIES TO MURDER WIFE
Jealous Husband Attempts
Her Life When She De-;
nies His False Charges
The Supreme Court of California yes- :
terday sustained the judgment of the .
Superior Court of Los Angeles and
Griffith J. Griffith, who shot bis wife at â 
Santa Monica in 1903, will go to San
Quentin for two years and pay a fine
of $5000. The case was one of the most ,
famous in the history of the State,
the social position and financial stand- '
ing of the defendant causing a fiercely
contested legal battle, the defense be- !
ing alcoholic insanity.
According to the testimony of Mrs. |
Griffith, her husband came into her
room as she was preparing to leave
the Arcadia Hotel in Santa Monica and
after a dramatic scene shot her. The
ball destroyed one eye and in the ex
citement Mrs. Griffith fell out of a
window.
The trial Jasted several months and â 
on March 2. 1904, Griffith was pro- i
nounced guilty of assault with a |
deadly weapon and sentenced by Judge
B. N. Smith. Appeal was taken and
Grrtffltl) came to this city on a habeas
corpus writ, but yesterday's decision i
by Justice Henshaw and concurred in ;
by Justices McFarland and Lorigan
means that the convicted man wHI
have to go to prison.
Prior to the shooting Griffith, who Is I
a millionaire, occupied a place of high j
esteem in I,os Angeles. He had pre- !
sented a Jarre park to the city, which '
was named after him, and was made an i
official In the city government. After !
the shooting, however. Griffith was dls- i
graced, public sympathy being with |
the wife.
The main joint of the defense in the '
famous trial was that Griffith, at the \
time of the shooting, was suffering
from alcoholic insanity and that when
he drew the revolver he meant only to ;
threaten his wife, but being excited j
and for the time Insane accidentally :
pulled the trigger. The statements of !
the wife on the stand that her hus- i
band had often drunk to excess t
weighed with the jury in considering
the crime.
With mind fired by alcohol Griffith |
entered the room of his wife on the ;
third day of September, 1903. and offer
talg her a prayer book drew a revolver j
and commanded her to prepare for j
death. Terror stricken the wife pleaded '
with her husband to spare her life.
Paying no heed Griffith solemnly asked
her if she had poisoned a friend of his,
II ehe har] attempted to poison him and
if she had been untrue. Upon her
fervently' denying the implications he
shot her.
Suffering intense pain and groping i
blindly, the woman backed to an open i
window and fell to the roof of a house [
next door. She crawled through the J
window on the floor below before her
husband could fire a second shot. In '
its decision the Supreme Court ex- 1
pressed the opinion that the assault â 
was most brutal and unpardonable.
Women Fight a Policeman.
Mrs. Genia Passera and her mother,
Mrs. Catherine Lalezzi, who live at
516 Montgomery avenue, were arrest

o V\ Last summer while recovering from ill-
Â° ness of fever, I had a severe attack of â 
J Inflammatory Rheumatism in the knees,
from which I was unable to leave' my
room for several months. I was treated
. by two doctors and also tried different
kinds of linaxnents and medicines which '
seemed to relieve me from pain for
awhile, but at the same time I was not
' any nearer getting well. One day .while
reading a paper I saw an advertisement
of S. S. S. for Rheumatism. I decided
to give it a trial, which I did at once
Af Â£er I had taken three bottles I felt a
great deal better, and I still continued
to take it regularly until I was entirely
cured. I .now feel better than for years,
and I cheerfully recommend Â£, S. S. to
any one suffering from Rheumatism.

BERGER-LONG BOXING BOUT
. IS AN ATTRACTIVE MATCH
Heavyweights Will Be the Stars at the
. Bay City Athletic Club
Show.
The boxing show offered .by the Bay
City Athletic Club at Woodward's Pa
vilion to-mor"row â  night, although
headed by the Long-Berger bout, is
nude up of good enough material in
the preliminaries to . advertise each
separate match as a special event. The
Long-Berger contest is attracting the
most attention, but the card gives
promise of an excellent night's sport.
Jack Grey and Dick Sullivan are ex
pected to put up a good contest by
the fight fans. Only one decision is
registered against Grey. Willie Wolff
was giyen. a decision over him that
â was Jeered by the spectators. Dick
Sullivan is the boy who was substitut
ed for Gus Salid at the San Francis
co Club's last show. At a moment's
notice he jumped into the , ring and
beat Harry Riley, whom many of the
sports considered invincible. Both
Grey and Sullivan have been ' training
with a vengeance for the bout and as
both can give and take a good punch
their argument should give the on
lookers thorough satisfactibn.
"South Side" Jack O'Brien and
Young Dempsey also figure in a spe
cial match. Both have enviable rec
ords and have no.t lost for some time.

Senator Proposes to Settle
Colorado Contest by Seat
ing* Lieutenant Governor
DENVER âº March Iâ After a long
executive session of the gubernatorial
contest, this afternoon thirteen of the
eighteen Republican members signed
a report In favor of continuing
Governor Alva Adams in the office.
The other five Republican members,
including Chairman William H. Grif
fith, refused to sign either report.
Senator Alexander, one of the Repub
licans who refused to sign the Pea
body report, made a hard fl^ht during
the afternoon for the rejection of the
claims of both the contestor and con
te^tee and the seating in the Governor's
chair of Lieutenant Governor Jesse
McDonaW. He found no supporters for
this plan in thn committee, but he may
bring it up before the joint Assembly
as a compromise measure. His argu
ment was that there was no doubt of
the election of McDonald, while there
ts( doubt as to whether Adams or Pea
body was lawfully elected.
To-morrow the House and Senate will
meet in joint session and receive the re
ports of the committee. Time will be
allotted to the two sides for argument,
arrd in the afternoon it is expected that
John M. Waldron, chief counsel for
Peabody, will open arguments. It is
believed a vote will be reached Satur
day night.

which had been seized as'smu&jrled
and condemned. The stuff was found
in an express wagon on Kearny street
near Sacramento on May 24, 1887. It
was taken through the usual court
procedure and on July 30 of the same
year United States Marshal J. c.

YOELL'S VALET
SIGNS CHARGES
Statement in Evidence Has
Bearing Upon Stories of
Plotting Against Life
EXCERPTS FKOM DIARY
Pioneer's Journal of- Events
Throws Light Upon Settle
ment With His Wife
It has become a question whether or
not a son of James Alexander Yoell
sought his father's life by suggesting
that a Chinese cook place poison in
coffee. Attorney Delmas yesterday put
in evidence a signed statement, and a
letter of John Kay. who was Yoell's
valet. The statement in question was
in Yoell's handwriting and bore Kay's
signature. It follows:
On Thursday. January 27, 189 S. at the resi
dence of J. Alexander Yoell. on th<* Alameiia
road, near- San Jose, Santa ' Clara County,
Cal., I heard William A. Y.oell. son of J. Al
exander Yuell. say to Ah Kirn. Chinese cook
employed at said J. Alexander Yoell'e: "Old
man" (meanlns Mi. Yoell) "heap crazy.
V>'hy don't you put poison in his coffee?" "Mr.
Yoell was always called "the old. man" by'
the Chinaman and' the children of' the fam-
I lly when speaking of him. 1 told Mr. Yoell,
on the 28ih ot January. 189S, the above words.
, of- his son, Willie Yoell. lam read-y to swear
I to the truth of all the above, and sign this
j statement iw auch use as Mr. Yoell't Inter
est may need. JOHN KAY.
San Jose, Aaril' 29. 180 S. . â¢ " . "
Besides the statement there was a
i Letter from Kay in the exhibit, in which
| the valet said he was Yoell's friend.
EXTRACTS FROM DIARYi
j In addition to this documentary evi
| dence, Mr. Delmas offered extracts
;from the dead attorney's diary. There
i was some trouble over the admission of
this evidence, inasmuch as Mr. Delrnaa
j held that the journal was sacred and
| the parts not offered in evidence should
ibe sealed. Mr. Hoeffler objected to this
idea and it was finally agreed that the
j attorney for the contestants should
read the unoffered entries bat hot
make them public. â¢ .
From the quoted excerpt from' the
diary it was shown that Yoe.ll' had- re
quested his son, Willie, not to enter
his room -without knocking. On ac
count of this request the son went to
the mother with abuse of his father.
Yoell reproached his sun for his com
plaint at the breakfast table, but Wil
liam ignored the fact that his father
was speaking. Thereupon/according to
the diary, Yoell slapped William lightly
in. the face and William, first" trying to
strike with his fist and then swinging
a chair at his father, said "I will, kill
you for this." The diary entry .states
; that Yoell replied-, "Yes, I know you
: would like to kill me/ You told Kirn
to poison my coffee. I know all about
that.". . â¢â¢.'.'â 
Another of the old man's entries told
the story of his parting from his sec
; ond wife, the mother of the contest
j ants of the will. He says. they went to
: Oakland to fix the matter . of the
' divorce and the settlement . of $200,000
j worth of property upon her. The night
| before she had kissed him and the next
morning greeted him pleasantly. They.
: rode together to the city, his arm over
I the back of her seat. Arm In arm they
walked in Oakland and lunched to
j gether.
| . DAUGHTERS GLAI>.
After the settlement wtis arranged
i they returned to the home in San Jose
: and, meeting two of the daughters on
j the porch, told them that all was
! fixed," whereupon ttie daughters ex-
I pressed their gladness.- The family
; dined together and wife and husband
' exchanged an affectionate good night.
i Next morning, before he was out ot
! bed. Mrs. Yoell asked for. money to
| tide her over until she could, realize'
on the property given to her in the
settlement and he wrore her a check.
I',ater, upon his leaving for San Fran
cjpco, they "kissed and kissed" for the
last time.

' resenting the spinning mills of . that
!, country, for which he has been buying ;
material, is at the Palace Hotel await
ing the departure of the ne*t steamer < ,

the Japanese Government to 1 come to i
â¢ the United State's, and contract for cot
;. ton yarn for the manufacture of gar
ments far the Mikado's army. - While "
"in this country he has visited all the:
big cotton mills and has purchased :
5,000,000 pounds of what is commonly j
termed- hosiery yarn. â .
â  Japan is now operating twelve Â»pin- !
ning mills, of which five are located in
Tokio, where the force employed .-Is
about 4000. Discussing his visit yester- ,
: day, Dr. Ea-stlake- said: ' â¢ â¢
I. ' The ' mills of Japan are turning out- dally
i for . Usa in â¢ the â¢ army 10.0 CO dozen " pairs of
: suck;, 50CO dozen suits of underwear and 7000 'â 
i dozen cheaters. The socks are peculiarly :
knitted : like a bag- so that- the wearer may'
turn them around, on his feet and -thus avoid
annoying foot sores. Each soldier: is allotted i.
â¢ three* pairs of socks,, two suit* of underwear. j
1 a sweater, &nd two pair of gloves, and when
. he dies* all his- wearing apparel, except his
overcoat, is buried with him on thÂ« battle
i field.- The > Government : has been buying
American cotton' yarn and would .have also [
â  bought "your woolen yarn but for the Â«f o^ |
hibitlve tariff, which necessitated the purchase â 
: of that article from Germany. The main pur
pose' of the Government is to place. its spin-
ning mills in closer touch with the American j
mills .by buying direct, and this was my mlfc- !
sion' to the United States.'- By buying direct
.the Japanese save from 1.1 to -5 per cent that â 
j wculd otherwise go to middlemen. It Is a
' cash 'proposition, letters of credit having pre- !
ceded me to this country,, and upon these we I
draw. t |
; â¢ Dr. ; Eastlake* has been living for i.
twenty years in Tokio, where he was f
at the head of a medical college up "to j
the opening of the war. On February
l'of last year he volunteered- his ser- j
vices to -the Japanese Red Cross So- 1
ciety and Immediately went to the i
. front.- 'He was wounded twice- in the
early engagements r the last time in the I
battle of Kiurenjo, or, as the Japanese j
pronounce.it, Kee Lieng Chung. '.On
that ' occasion he was ripped open by
a wounded Russian .whom he had
picked up on the field of battle. His
first wound was from a portion of a [
-Russian shell that had spent its force.
1 In speaking of the frequent reported j
.atrocities of â¢ the Russians he said that [
-during his experience at the front he
found only, two instances, and they j
were- undoubtedly committed by the J
Russians, for he found two Japanese j
: soldiers with their eyes gouged out.
Of" the Japanese Dr. Eastlake re- j
marked: . ' . â¢ - ' â¢
It is a mistaken 'Idea that the Japanese sol- j
1 diers are guided by fanaticism. On the con-"
â  trary, it la the loftiest kind of patriotism that
. has bucyed them along in this war. on which I
i hinges .their future national freedom. As to .
i .their Red Cress work on the rteM I 'doubt If t
! any nation has ever made or will ever make ;
"a better record.. Although the great army of j
I the Mikado has b*en confronted with the worst j
- Qf- hardship*. It has yet to b* attacked with I

Xew York Stock Market. . : : :
NEW' YORK. March âThe stock market
was relieved to-day from urgent pressure to
iralise. mch a* characterised It yesterday, and
thows evidence of revived atrÂ«nÂ«th. Attempts
io lift prices, however, were constantly frus
trated br Â«n outpouring of celling ' orders at j
the hJgrh !Â»vÂ«fs, Â» hlcj-, â  turced the course of
prices award a number of times during" '
the day after conelder&bie advance* had been
effected. Thera is a decided faJllna; off also
iti: the buying: demand st thÂ« high level. In
dicating that confidence ' was not ' fully re
established ' . in : the . stability ot the market.
There Â«.j* a party In the speculation holding
s j>rcnouncÂ«d new in favor of . a further rr
a-'tlon in prices: -as being justified by the ex
t^nt of the previous advance, and also by the
!a.ck of ccnSrmaUon of the many rumors upon
which "it ntd been accomplished. But the
bear r^rtj ; sribwes no Elgns of the aggreselve
'lispositicn manifeÃted in iha fierce raids upon
trice* in yesterday's trading. On. account of
this; moderation In the tactic* of the bears,
and thÂ«r of the opposing party in fel
louring the advance with buying orders, the
trading wat much quieter than for several
r. â¢â  y & pa* t. and â  there was a decided ' shrinkage
ir. the volume of thÂ« day's dealings. The de
rr.arrd from the shorts to .cover; was a oon
Â».-iÂ»"rable factor In rallying prices when the
fes:nlr.g power of thÂ« market was developed.
X*-wr York was conspicuous? affected by. this
â factor. â  The rÂ«Â«-Â©very was stimulated by sev
eral - new poicu â -'. strength. The most con
spicuous of these was the Southern group of
railroad stocks which roM quite easily with
cui any news announcement. The movement
!r. them was attributed to one of the specula
tive parties which has toeen prominent In that
group of rtocks cm previous occasions.
Amalgamated Copper ! was a - figure " of
r:rer.gt:: In cplte of the - reduced export* of
copper ' for February. ' Reports of large orders
Tor. eteel /rails to the United States Bteel
corporation, wer* of moderate Â©fleet on these â 
Â» -. ' Xt Money was easier and the rate for '
Â« ill loans wai lower. The speculative liquida
tion wac assigned as the cause of the easier
tor.c of Tr.oney in part, and the passing of the
Cerrportry *fleet of the Southern Pacific bond
i: &nhfictlon was also a factor. .Ac the day
progressed without the dreaded renewal of
jfeesure c? speculative liquidation, sentiment
chpved a growth of confidence, and the whole
tonÂ«:of-thÂ« market gained In strength. Be
.* :Â«i shorts added to the volume of the buy

"LOHENGRIN" WELL
PUT ON LAST NIGHT
Savages Sbow Careful Work in
the Wagnerian Masterpiece.
San Francisco Girl
Is Back With
Culture.
Warner in a. bijou theater like the
Columbia is a rather incredible prop
osition. However, the Savage com
pany gave there last night, with a re
arranged orchestra and some sacrifice
of scenic spaciousness, a remarkably
good "Lohengrin. 1 ' One's respect for
the company grows with each new pro
duction. In each is seen the same care
ful, sincere and workmanlike effort, the
came absence of pretentiousness, the
tame conscience. For $2 Wagner :it
â would go hard to rind better, and for
me it was quite worth the $3 that Mr.
Savage gets everywhere else than in
this Western Milan! .! . > .;
Mr. William Wegener. the Lohengrin,
was himself worth quite half of it. I
do not know whether Mr. Wegener is
as young as most of the Savage peo
ple. If he is, it seems likely that he
.will some day be importantly heard :
from. His vocal quality is both un
usual and beautiful, something of that
quality that we have agreed to call
"golden." There is plenty of the voice,
and it is even though not always even
ly used, and there is a wide, â¢ easy
range. The tenor sings, â  too. with
remarkable sympathy. That Mr. Weg
ener is the handsomest Lohengrin ever
â¢een here is an item that will interest
chocolate row, and certainly . added
much to the picture last night. .....
The appearance of Miss Rita N>w
man as Ortrud, however, was : th?
thing last night, RtIM Newman is a
Ban Franciscan vho left here nine
years ago with a coloratura soprano to
return this week as a contralto, or
rather a* a mezzo soprano. -. Modest,
dignified and with a quite marked dra
matic quality when the singer remem
bered to forget herself, was Miss NVw
tnan's Ortrud. Her voice is not power
ful, but is warm end pleasing, and well
used except in the matter of attack
that lacks certainty. Her coloratura
experience shows itself most. usefully
In the florid passages, that are handled
in particularly light and flexible
fashion. Altogether we may be proud
to add Miss Newman to the list of
California singinp lights, and the con
servatoryful of blossoms that went
over the footlights was: as well de
eerved as the hearty applause; .'.'.-
Miss Rennyson as Elsa showed her-
Belf handsomely capable ox sustained
effort. Much more individual ale Â« .iyas
the conception and rendering than that
cf her Desdemona. The characteriza
tion at times had a veritable dramatic
pulse, and the part was throughout
veil sung. Winfred GoC essayed the
T*!ramund in moderately effective
fashion. Harrison W. Bennett was a
very tall and: stately king and the
herald would have been setter had he
been content to sing in only two keys
at onceâ he frequently attempted four.
Mr. Schcnck sat to the conducting
last night and it moat be- owned to a
sympathetic and cultured beatâ though
still slack. One was very grateful, too,
for the very excellent balance main
tained between the orchestra and the
voices, the rearrangement of th? or-
chestra having, too, a most gratifying
effect on its internal balance. ThÂ»
chorus again shone, so did the settings.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. MARCH 2. 1905.
CHINESE TELL
OF PROTECTION
Last of Oriental Witnesses
in Wittman Trial Describe
Payment of Corruption Coin
OBJECTS TO EVIDENCE
Congressman Kahn Says
His Client Is Not Liable
Under Hearsay Testimony
. â . â¢ !
The Police Commissioners last ; night
continued the hearing of the charges
of incompete-ncy and neglect .of duty
against Chief of ' Police George W.
\y.ittman. The only witnesses heard
were several Chinese gamblers, whose
testimony was mainly hearsay and
called' forth frequent objections* , from
Congressman Kahn..' -.'â '''.
In several instances the Commission
ers asked' questions that Kahn Objected
to as being unfair and contrary to law
and in the majority of cases he carried
his point. The testimony of the Chi
nese erred to the raids in Chinatown
and 'the payment of protection money.
Many, of Kahn's questions were di
rected against the integrity of the Chi
nese Educational Society and the v se
crecy of the proposed, raid by Commis
sioner Hutton. His attacks on the
character of the Chinese, witnesses,
who were, all members of the Educa
tional Society, recalled : that several'
had been arrested on charges- of mur
der and attempted murder. At the con
clusion of the evening 'the contradic
tory testimony of the Chinese favored
the defendant's case. . â¢
Last night finished the testimony of
all Chinese .connected with the case.
The" Commissioners, announced that
they would bring in seventy-three wit
nesses who. will testify before Kahn
oallS the witnesses for the defense. The
hearing will be continued to-night at
7:30 o'clock. â¢
The first witness called in the trial, of
Chief of Police George W. Wittman
was Wong Lung, who admitted Tues
day that he - was a \ member of the
Chinese Educational Society. He was
the last of three Chinese witnesses
called Tuesday and was recalled last
night by Congressman Kahn. â¢ Kahn
made a strong attempt to show that
the Educational Society was support
ing Wong Lung and was paying him
to testify. This the .'witness denied,
but admitted that during the Tuesday
night hearing he was sent for by the
society. He denied that he had talked
with any one or been coached in his
testimony. â¢â  - --â'..
â¢Kahn further drew from the witness
the admission that he was once arrest
ed for stabbing a Chinaman named
Wong Chuck in Alaska . in 1901. The
witness denied, however, that he was
a member of the Yung Yick High
binder Society.'
Wong Lungftoldof the informing of
twenty members of -the Educational
â¢Society that . Hutton' was to raid SJO
Washington street. Both Hutton and
Attorney Carpenter were at the so
ciety roomjf and many, : Chinese in the
room went" up to 820 Washington street
to see the raid take 'place.
DO KIP TALKS.
The sec'-nd Chinese witness called
was Do Kip, who had charge of the
ac< "intp of the Wan Lee fantan house
at 522 Washington street. He said that
$o per table per week was paid to the
representative of the See Yup Society
and the same tribute to Chan Oheuns-
Do Kip then started to say what Chan
Cheung tnid him became of the money
he collected, and Kahn began a long
series of strenuous objections.
The witness Â«as then asked by
Drinkhouse how he charged the pay
ments in the books, and Kahn again
objected. The witness said they were
charged up tn "expense." This charge
covered oniy one $5 payment. The $5
paid to the See Yup Society was en
tered simply "See Yup, $5." Kahn
called the Commissioners' attention to
the unfairness of hearsay evidence by
saying that the witness might testify
that some one told him the money was
for the Commissioners as much as for
the police. He urged that the Commis
sioners were there to consider only the
facts and not as a prosecuting body.
The witness said that Kwan Bin, one
of the "Eight Statesmen, " told him
that "the police had been fixed" and
that after the place had been closed
two days it was reopened and not
molested. Kahn objected to this testi
mony as hearsay, and it was stricken
from the record.
The witness admitted he was also
known as Kung Chow and was a mem
ber of the Educational Society. He
said that gambling continued a week
after Hutton's raid and that Sergeant
Cook visited the place the day after
the raid. The next minute h*Â» said he
had not seen Cook after the raid.
PO'S MEMORY BAD.
Leung Heung Po, another member
of the Educational Society, was next
called. He testified that he visited
gambling places in Chinatown from
November 7 to 29. When asked who
was the squad sergeant at that time
he said it was too far back to remem
ber.
Leung Toy, employed in a gambling
hoMse at 826 Washington stret, testi
fied to gambling at that place and the
payment of protection money to the
See Yup Society and to the "Eight
Statesmen." His testimony finished
the evening session and the last of the
Chinese witnesses.
At the opening of the regular "week
ly meeting action in the cases of Ser
geants Ellis, Fraher and Brophy and
Patrolmen O'Brien, Munn. Doran, Mc-
Grath and Henry Heinz of the China
town squad was postponed until next
Wednesday evening. The postpone
ment was on the motion of Commis
sioner Reagan and Sergeant Ellis was
not present when the squad was told
of the postpoment.
Secretary Boyne was instructed by
the board to notify the Oceanslde Club
that the application of Henry Doscher
for a saloon license on the Great High
way would come up at the regular
meeting on March 15. This is in ac
ccrdance with the promise of the
board to notify the residents who may
wish to oppose the granting of the
license. The remainder of the regular
session was consumed in granting
l&ck and restaurant licenses.
