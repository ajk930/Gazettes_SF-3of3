CARTER EXPLAINS WHY
HE WROTE RESIGNATION
Governor Carter of Honolulu, who recently furnished a surprise by sending his resig
nation to President Roosevelt, arrived here yesterday on the liner Alameda. : He is on his
way to Washington to confer with the Chief Executive. Carter handed in his resigna
tion that the President might be unhampered "in dealing with the situation in the territory.
Governor of Hawaii
Arrives on the
Alameda.
Is on His Way to
Confer With the
President.
Has Long Story to
Tell the Chief
Executive.
George Carter, Governor of the Terri
tory of Hawaii, was a passenger on the
liner Alameda, which arrived yesterday
from Honolulu. Governor Carter is on
his way to Washington for a consultation
with President Roosavelt. Carter recently
tendered to the President his resignation
as Governor of Hawaii With his formal
raiOenatJon-.be forwarded *- request : for
permission to visit Washington and lay
before the chief executive certain mat
ters connected with the government of
Hawaii. "V-
Carter's resignation followed closely the
announcement of the result of the terri
torial elections. The Sheriff, whom Car
ter had removed from office and whose
re-election the Governor strongly op
posed, was re-elected by a large majority
and it was suggested that this popular
disregard of executive desire was the
prime reason for the Governor's resign
ing.
Carter denies this.
"The result of the election did not
please me, I will admit," said Carter yes
terday, "but' that was only one little
Incident and taken by itself would never
have suggested any thought of retire
ment. The full reason for my sending
In my resignation is a long story and
one I do not feel at liberty to tell at
this time. I will say this much, how
ever. As territorial Governor I repre
sent in Hawaii the President of the
United States. The President is a man
'of decided views. I have views of my
own In regard to Hawaiian matters and
I felt that in some things my views dif
fered from those of President Roosevelt.
"I am going to Washington to have a
long talk with the President and my real
reason for placing my resignation in his
hands was to avoid any embarrassment
In the event of his deciding to place some
body else at the helm In Hawaii."
Carter has been Governor of Hawaii
more than two years and his administra
tion has been of the vigorous order. As
& result of his efforts, the territorial of
fices have been reorganized on a business
basis.
Under Carter, heads of departments
have been selected for their personal fit
ness, without regard to political affilia
tions, and Government employes have
been compelled to give a full day's work
for a day's pay. Public officials are now
tinder -bonds. Every publio school now
flies the American flag. Through Car
ter's personal efforts Territorial bonds to
the amount of $3,000,000 were sold In New
York at a goal price. The proceeds of
these bonds are being used in making
long-needed public Improvements.
Governor Carter, whatever the outcome
â¢f his visit to Washington, will return to
Honolulu, which he looks upon as his
home. The natives, he says, are making
splendid citizens. At first It was feared
that, given the right to vote, the native
< lenient would combine and control Terri
torial affairs. The probability of this.
Governor Carter believes. Is remote,
"Race feeling Is fading away and such
differences as there will be In the future
\u25a0will be on strictly political and not on
race lines," he.eaid.
Governor Carter, who , Is accompanied
by Mrs. Carter and his private secretary.
V. Creedon, will remain in San Francisco
three or four days before proceeding to
the national capital.

Great Prevalence of
Fires During the
Day,
Pyrotechnical and
Other Entertain
ment Provided.
Crash: bang! boomâ cannon crackers
and dynamite.
San Francisco rave herself up to a
mighty celebration of Fourth of July.
from midnight until midnight young and
old vying with each other In producing
noises, in keeping with their intense
patriotism.
Every one was happy, and expansive
emiles orf the faces of the thousands on
the streets told plainly that they were
enjoying the one hundred and twenty
ninth birthday of the nation to the fullest
extent. There were many small fires.
At the Emergency Hospital the doctors
â¢were kept busy binding up burned fing
ers and sewing lacerated ears. Police
men vigorously applied the power of the
law to those who had indulged too freely
in cooling "Liberty Punch," but these
things were expected and the Fourth
would be a disappointing holiday with
out them.
TliÂ«re were, however, two unfortunate
accidents to mar the day. Two men were
killed while firing pyrotechnics.
The despotic small boy and his giant
cannon cracker reigned. As soon as the
clock, struck the hour of midnight the
youngsters, knowing that the talons of
the bluecoats had been muffled by the
chiefs fiat, ran out half-dressed and
vifh trembling fingers lighted unrestrain
tuly the explosives they had been setting
off covertly since the first of June. After
that sleep was Impossible. Dynamite
bombs, pin-wheels, sizzers. nigger-babies,
Â£ky-rocketÂ« and romao candles filled the
atmosphere with tremendous reports and
Oriental smells, much to the "glee of the
youngsters. Not one grown person cared
if his care did. cease to distinguish sound
Â«t 10 o'clock in the morning, - not one
thought mean things when a small boy
snapped a torpedo suddenly under his
very feet, not one yelled in rage a* he
saw his pet terrier running madly down
the street with bursting crackers snap
ping ,on .his .tall, for every one, man.
woman and child, had entered into the
spirit of the day with a whole-souled
ness for which San Francisco is famous.
Great crowds sought the cool air of the
suburban towns and the outgoing early
morning trains and ferries were crowded
to overflowing. Picnics, races and ath
letic sports drew many away from the
confines of the city; yet the San Fran
cisco parks were full, the beach was
thronged and there were great crowds
left to wander up and down the streets.
Great American flags stretched out in
the breeze from a thousand silent masts,
lugging and pulling in an effort to break
away from the restraining halyards and
fly free into the inviting atmosphere.
Store- windows were dressed for the oc
casion in patriotic colors. Automobiles
whizzed by, decked from end to end with
gay red, white and blue bunting. Car
riage wheels were resplendent with the
national flag.
The oid and sometimes deadly cap pis
tol was everywhere and the ordinary
erackere with which our fathers gleefully
scared restless horses were In the hands
of every boy. But these did not equal in
popularity the more modern instruments
or explosion. A repeating set of tor
pedoes on the end of a lone stick, which
produced Â« noise that would rival that
of a Maxim, was the greatest weapon of
the Cay. Then there was a patent whiz
aer which exploded in the air and like as
not came down on the awning" of the
foolish shopkeeper who had left his can
vas up as a target for the small boy. This
was also very popular. Another was a
whrel which rolled down the streets, ex
ploding larte caps with a terrific report.
Thss was particularly useful in scaring

SETS OFF BIG BLASTS.

vrr Srrkcrs on <he Beach.
A succession of ten blasts near the Cliff
House served to entertain, the pleHsure
teekers on ths beach for several minutes
yesterday afternoon. The blasts were set
off by Owen McHugh. who haa the ctn- '
tract for the widening of the road. Some
500 / pounds of plant powder was used to
dislodge the rock,-' the operations being
tinder the supervision cf McHugh. Sev
eral police officers were kept busy for an
hour moving the people out of barm's
tray before the first fuse was touched on*.
Several thousand people gathered in the
vicinity to witness the blasting, which
began at 4 o'clock. The first blast carried
a - shower of email rock skyward in the
direction cf the beach and up the road
toward the Cliff House, Some of the
rocks fell on the hats of the nearest on-!
lookers, but no damage was done.
The second, blast was a deafening af
fair and drowned the sound of the surf
momentarily. The other blasts were
touched off In rapid succession and aided :
materially In the noisy celebration of the
day. . â¢
Many thousands of cubic yards rJ solid
rock were loosened by the blasts and the
roÂ«dway was rendered impassable to
teams until the debris was cleared away.
The blasting is necessary for tÂ£Â»e purpose
of widening the roadway. Its present
wlith cf sixty feet will be increased' to
129 feet, thus making a beautiful drive
way when completed. The contract ' for
the blasting, was^ awarded by the" Board
of Public Works, which has also under
way the building of a parapet along the
road on the beach Fide.

tion of Independence;
Great crowds gathered at the Alhambra
Theater at 2 o'clock In the af ternoon to
hear the literary and "musical exercises
and the speeches of the day. The great
hall was tastily decorated. Around the
balcony hung bunting, while across the
stage was stretched an immense .Ameri
can flag. On one side of the stage was
a large portrait of McKinley and on the
other was a likeness of President Roose-.
velt The crowd, was enthusiastically:
patriotic and when "America" was played,
the people roee in a body and made the
hall ring with the sound of. their voices. â¢
Rev. B. .Â»M. Kaplan opened the after
. noon's programme with the invocation.
He was followed by Rev. J. P. McQuaide,
who told of the momentous hour when
the Declaration of Independence was
signed and of the importance of that
: hour to the young Americans of to-day.
He then introduced Mayor E. E. Schmitz,
who read that legacy of -the founders of
our country. At the conclusion of the
reading an orchestra played the "Ameri
can Patrol." The Knickerbocker Ouar
tet sang "In Liberty's Name" and' Miss
F. Binny de .Forest recited "ThÂ« Un
known Speaker." Miss Ray Delvalle, "ac
companied on the piano by Miss , Emma
Kahn. sang "The Star Spangled Banner."
GI.OHIKS OK. THE FOURTH.
Supervisor James L. Gallagher, orator
of the day, was then introduced. He. said
in part:
The Fourth of July it distinctively the na
tional holiday, and with respect to the na
tional character it Is undoubtedly the most im
portant and the most significant day jof all
the days of the year. Throughout the entire
country, in every State of the Union, in every
city, town and village to-day the American
people meet to pledce anew their (Jevatlon ! to
thoÂ«Â« eternal principle! : enunciated "in.-, the
Declaration of Independence;: for we. recognize
that trom those principles, : and from- the devo
tion of the early American patriots, to these
principles have come to us all the blessings
of \u25a0 self-government and a liberty of Individual
thought and action that has brought happiness
to all, and . has I made th* , United States of
America the greatest, the most powerful and
the most generous nation that 'has ever held a
place In the history of mankind. It Is the
greatest, because its objects and purposee are
th* highest and noblest; it is the most power
ful, for the reason that, the American system
of common schools brings a higher ' degree of
education to the masses of â¢ the people, â¢. and it
is knowledge that constitutes power; and It Is
the rooht generous, in that It has never scorned
to take advantage of the weaknesses of other
nations, and has n>vÂ«r hesltatt-d, at whatever
tost, to take up. and defend the cause of , the

AMERICANS APPRECIATIVE.
No one has ever accused the American peo
ple of .. being, unapprec.ia.tive Â»of the blessings
that flow from their form of government. â¢ It
is,' however, but natural for -those .who wer*
bora and reared in this country to accept their
surroundings and , environment and ". form of
government as a matter of course. 1 It is only
when we contemplate the trials and Bufferings
of the* masses pf the people of other countries
that "we come to a full realization" of the
priceless heritage of American citizenship. The
present troubles in the unhappy empire ; of
Kussla show more clearly than words . can ex
press the oppressions and the evils; that' flow
from an arbitrary form of government.,' While
cur Government, fettered and jS restrained by
the ethics of diplomacy, iÂ» prevented from glv
.ing Â«ny;Â«fflclal expression- that might be con
sidered offensive to a government : with Tirhich'
our .nation is at peace... there certainly can .be
no impropriety in the American; people, ae
eembled upon the day dedicated to- the eplrit :
of American freedom, indulging -and express
ing tb> hope that their. brother* in that far-off
country may "be able to throw oft the yoke- -- of
j At f potism, and enjoy with us the blessings of
that liberty which the Creator Intended should
be the right and- the portion of all his chll
; drerf. ' :\u25a0 .\u25a0:.-â¢, v -\u25a0 \u25a0 - â¢ \u25a0 -
Much has-been eatd of late In the dally press
concerning the "yellow, peril,'.*' and some have
expressed the fÂ«ar that the ; deduction to be
drawn from the present war In the Orient is
that the Oriental is a match for the Caucasian
notwithstanding Our civilization No
conclusion could be more , erroneous, and In
answer to It we need only say that if through
out the empire of, Russia a generation, ago the
preMptor and ths school; book /had taken the
place "Of the ."Cof*ack and the knout . there
would have been a different Ule to tell of the
Russo-Japanese war. The real ' lewon, to be
drawn from recent events lls that \u25a0so long as
our people^ remain true to the principles 'upon
which this Government Is', founded, -and -.so
long .as they exercise the elective franchise in
accordance with: the. dictates of their own' con
science and judgment, this country will "go on
serenely upon Its course, meeting and solving
in the light, of .'reason -and experience -all the
great governmental- and- social problems .that
have vexed humanity from the earliest ages.

- URBANO. Ohio. July, 4.â The. three* day
centennial celebration ; of the founding of
Champaign . County as" an organized
county, of Ohio began here to-day. An
address by: â¢ Vice' President" Fairbanks,
who . was ' Just : across : the " line In
Union County, was the feature of the
day. : Mr. Fairbanks said: -
i ''This \ is essentially freedom's day. The
people do Veil ; to . lay. aside their custom
ary; duties and celebrate ; it." It Is the day
above all ' others when .we should . rever
ently " and gratefully . recall . the sacrifices
and 'j recount r the story " of those who
fought so' wondrously- In freedom's holy
name in times which are ' past.' The Con
tinental fathers set : a ; high standard of
devotion and duty to country. The story
of their heroic endeavor is ever inspiring.
Their, sons, actuated, by their-, example,
have extended the zone of human liberty.
%: "The principles united so felldtiouslyin
tire , Declaration ' of Independence have
been the people's unfailing ,' guide and
they " have . given freedom Jto * millions lin
their own land and millions ' more In the
distant seas. ' Freedom ' has never . come
as a free will offering. :It has . been pur
chased by the blood ; *of . those who so
loved It that ' they were willing rto die.
If need be, m that r others ; might enjoy it.
Yes: we have so loved [It that we . have
not only -drawn the sword to win! it our
selves, but have assembled our fleets and
marshaled our armies to give It to aliens
who were oppressed. '
"Our" people are filled with the true
national spirit. There is . nowhere among
us any divided allegiance. The: brave
men .who put ' their ,; hands to the Decla
ration of Independence . and - those who
made srood their , challenge to . King
George 111 set an example of high de
votion to ; liberty and country which
should be an inspiration to us and ,to
our children and their children's children
forever and forever.
.'/We have much reason -to be grateful,
for^ while there are wars and rumors of
wars about the earth," while other peoples
are ' In : the s throÂ«s ; of . unrest and revolu
tion; our people are. walking the ways of
peace, prepared for.war," but praying that
it ; may : never again disturb our national
tranquillity. A wise and Just course in
our relations -with other powers will
largely insure us against any internation
albreach.
"We may, take pride in the fact that
President Roosevelt has pointed the way
to the "re-establishment, of peace In the
Orient.' We find \u25a0 that the debate upon
the battlefield and upon .the seas must
in the final- analysis be concluded in the
deliberative chamber. â Would it not seem
that it were ; possible for men to * come
to reason upon great' international issues
before the Infraction 'of international
peace? May the powers or the .world, not
take a lesson from which : has occurred
and which is occurring, , and establish
some method by- which they â¢ may \u25a0 settle
their * difficulties in a manner : consistent
with J their honor,' without first invoking
the sword," without shedding each others'
blood "and bankrupting \u25a0 . each others*
treasury? . \u25a0 -
"As we -gather about the. altars of
patriotism to-day we take - new -- courage
and are filled with fresh purpose -to pre
serve Unpolluted our sacred temple ot
liberty."

Man and a Boy Are Accidentally
Killed by Toy Cannoni
MANY ARE WOUNDED, SOME BADLY
, Yesterday's display of patriotism
'cost two human beings their lives and
there were Innumerable minor acci
dents by which many people were in
jured, some seriously. _Â»
Of the jwo deaths, one was of a man,
half of whose head was blown off by
fragments of an exploding cannon. He
lay oij the street, as ghastly an object
as the atrocities of war could produce.
*A boy, 7 years of age, was the victim
of the other fatality. A wad from a
cannon that went off while another
boy was examining it to see why Jt
had missed fire pierced his abdomen
and he expired on a doctor's operating
table.
Both the shocking fatalities and
most of the accidents were caused l.Â»y
using instruments for noise making
that were far more dangerous than the
oijdinary fireworks. Despite Chief Dl
r.an's orders, the toy pistol was much
In evidence.
John Barry, a longshoreman, was
about to return to his work on the
* ..steamship Manchuria, and near Second
and Brannan streets he saw George
Lettes and Charles Hansen preparing
! to fire a. cannon a foot and a half long.
Barry stopped to watch them.
BARRY'S HEAD BLOWN OFF.
The cannon was touched oft and the
two men ran for co\*er. There was a
deafening report. The cannon explod
ed with the force of a. shell. A frag
ment struck Barry, tearing half of his
face and part of one lobe of his brain
away.
Barry had been living with his
mother at 104 Sil\'er street. He was
unmarried.
Hanson was taken into custody. He
became bo wrought up over the fatality
that he was removed from the City
\ â¢ Prison to the detention hospital, it be
ing feared his mind was about to give
way. Lettes fled and the police appre
bended him last night.
"When Chief Deputy Coroner McCor
miek asked as to the quantity of pow
der that had been put Into the cannon,
Hansen replied: "Oh, we put a good
big wad In it."
Davide Sofari. the boy who was kill
ed, met. his death on .Cedar avenue.
Bernard Sacrison, 18 years of ''ape, and
John Gallagher, 15, had been firing off
a toy cannon made of a piece of gas
pipe attached to a piece of wood. David
was enjoying ithe fun. and sometimes
was allowed to light the fuse. The
cannon finally hung fire and Sacrison
jtlcked it up to examine it. While do
ing bo it exploded and the wadding
penetrated little David's abdomen. The
wounded boy was carried to the office
of Dr. H. Spiro and died on the oper
ating table.
BOY MEETS DEATH.
Sacrison and Gallagher were arrest
Â» ed by Detectives Ed. Gibson and Mitch
ell and taken to police headquarters.
The officers also took possession of the
toy cannon. Sacrison made the follow
ing statement of how the accident oc
curred:
WÂ« had been flrlnc off the cannon all day
end the boy Solarl -was enjoying- the fun.
Sometimes, after I had loaded the cannon,
hÂ« would ask to be allowed to light the fuse.
\\> h&d been using cloth wadding at first,
but the supply rave out and we then used
p.-.r.er. About 2 o'clock Solarl lighted the fuse
And Oallacher and I nat on the marble steps
of a house waiting for the cannon to go off.
It did not Co of? and Solarl kicked It toward
mÂ«. X ro8Â« from the eteps and picked It up
t-> ccc why the charge had. not exploded.
The mouth of the cannon was pointed toward
Solart whfea It went off and he fell. The
iraddint - had entered *hla stomach.
Sacrison and Gallagher were booked at
the City Prison later on a charge of man
slaughter. The dead boy's father Is Louis
Solari, fruit merchant, 1415 Octavla street.
Sacrlson's parents live ai 569 Cedar ave
nue and Gallagher's next door.
J. Kelly, who lives at 28 Sacramento

burns of the right hand treated at the
Harbor Hospital.
J. Cunningham, 1061 Tennessee street,
was treated at the Harbor Hospital for
first degree burns of the right index
finger.
â¢ Harold Thompson, six years of age, who
lives at 2017 Taylor street, will carry
through life a crippled right hand as a
souvenir of a new deadly weapon known
as the toy dynamite pistol. This muruer
ous device shoots a dynamite cap. It
makes a terrific report and is guaranteed
harmless. Harold fired his once. It took
Surgeon Tillman at the/ Harbor Hospital
nearly an hour to trim thÂ« torn flesh and
to gather together and restore to place
the parted tendons. He did all that sur
gical skill could, but the, pretty baby
hand that pulled the trigger of .-, the
"harmless" dynamite gun will never.be
anything but a misshapen .stump.
HIS EVE SHOT OUT.

this afternoon, the residence of Miss

in during the twenty-four hours
reached a total of forty-three, "while

The Chief of Police instructed : the ; offi

last year that . fireworks would not? be
tolerated until the :[ night ; i before. Inde

losses was kept down by the activity, of
the \u25a0 Fire Department and the dispatch
\u25a0, with which. they answered each alarm. ;

GOES] TO SETTLE ftUESTIOXS.
""Regarding my visit* to the Philip
pines I have this to say. -There" are
several Questions out there that need
to^be settled, and that is the object of
my visit. tothe. islands. "On this trip I
am taking* six or seven- Senators, and
some twenty. Congressmen. . I want
them to", get I acquainted with the isl
ands and: take an Interest and "under
stand what' is going on .there.- They
canonly.do that by apersonal^visit. ;.
"Regarding, my position on the Chi
nese 'question, I jhaveTonly- this, to say,
that I .believe the exclusion law should
be enforced. I 'mean i by this the law;
as It: is written. vAa it. is now, the law
seems to be ao "extended as to \u25a0 prevent
what are called ; a' certain class ; of .mer
chants'; coming Into this country. "The
only ; class :of . Chinese ~ merchants that
I : Jtno w of are : the â¢: class that come to
our ; Eastern â¢\u25a0 shores., V Until JI: arrived
here :to--day I had- supposed that that
same class came there. : I 'am now in
formed; that. there is now another class
who call " themselves merchants. ; but
who ! really . are not. . :
"Thlfe naturally^ puts another phase
to'^the* case.' 5 ' The- Chinese merchants
liave'f referred to 'in my recent!
remarks; are mercnaTnts that -represent
the Chinese trade. If we want to ; trade
withrthe' Orient ; we have 'got' j to-culti
vate; the element I- speak of. Otherwise
their \u25a0 doors , will be closed -to us. This
means to the whole- United States, not
to California in -particular. SO far as
any; Chinese workman getting" .away
with work here,' I'll wager that any.
good Yankee can beat' him out. ,
WILL NOT DISCUSS POLITICS.
"I am not here to discuss politics in
any way, nor have I any expression â¢to
offer regarding the war in the.,, Orient
Among the questions I will discuss when
I getrto the Philippines will be. that of
the building of the commercial railways.
These will- cover about ; 10QG miles. These
roads are to be built by private {parties,
but It is the subject of the United States

More TorpeckKÃoats Put Out From Odessa
in Quest of the Outlawed Potemkine.
BUCHAEEST, Eoumania, July 4.â Before the Kniaz Poterakine sailed f rom Kus
tenji, a delegation from the crew handed the Prefect a proclamation^ iaddfessed Cto
the representatires of the powers in Eoumania, formally declaring war on allEussian
vessels which refuse to join the mutineers. The proclamation says the Kniaz Potem-:
kine will respect neutral territory and foreign snipping. The delegation requested
that the proclamation be forwarded to the powers.
ODESSA. July 4. â An attempt to re
vive the mutiny on thÂ« battleship
Georgi Pobiedonosetz was discovered
to-day. It was frustrated by loyal
sailers, who delivered six of the lead
ers to the authorities. The torpedo
boats which remained here have gone
to sea.
The situation saows signs of general
Improvement. The removal of debris
from the burned area has been begun
a.nd the general dock work and coast-
In? services have been resumed. The

A large number of troops has been

reach of the city.
The Odessa chamber of commerce has
petitioned the ministry of finance to
permit an extension of fourteen days
on notes falling due.
LONDON*. July 4.â A dispatch to the
Evening Standard from Odessa says the
Kniaz Potemkine has been sighted 23
miles off that port. This was not con
firmed by to-night's advices from
Odessa, which leave the whereabouts of
the pirate battleship In doubt. *
ST. PETERSBURG. July s.â lt Is
Btated that the transport Vecha, the
crew of which joined the mutineers In
the harbor of Odessa, surrendered to
day, In Russian waters.
PCIISUED BY TORPEDO-BOATS.
Mosquito Craft Will Attempt to Sink
the Kniaz Pot cmklnc
ODESSA, July 4. â It is reported per
eistently In naval circles that the
Kniaz Poternklne is being- stalked and
pursued j by several torpedo-boats,
which intend to bink her. The crews
of these boats consist of officers, who
volunteered,' and stokers, sq there is no
danger* of their refusal to obey orders.
The Kniaz Potemkine's hours are de
clared here to be numbered. Regret
Is expressed at the destruction of a
splendid and beautiful battleship and
the loss of life, but this is believed to
be preferable to the continued presence
of the ship in the Black Sea, command
ed by mutineers.
Several torpedo-boats were reported
to be off Odessa last niglit. There are
other signs of afctjvity among: the tor
pedo fleet.

Seven Thousand Persons Slain by Police

ODESSA, July 4. â I' learn on unim
peachable authority that for many
months about 150 especially chosen
Russian police agents In various dis
guises ha v*> lived among the working
people In the' industrial suburbs of
.Odessa, playing the infamous role- of
agents and procurateurs. The arrival
of the Knlaz Potemkine was repre
sented by them as showing that the
whole fleet had mutinied and would ar
rive to protect revolutionists.
Though wreckage and arson com
menced early on Wednesday evening,
â¢ absolutely no attempt was made to ar
rest the devastation until long after
Bundown. During the interval â¢ every
pos-siblÂ« avenue of escape was mili
tarily sealed and machine guns were
placed at every vantage point.

any one thus afflicted to many
who now enjoy the blessing of

suffering. f
"I have a son that had brain fever
when two years old, followed by fits of,
the worst type, and be was pronounced
incurable. I spent hundreds of dollars
for htm. without relief. After about
fifteen years he became bo bad that we
sent him to Longdiff hospital for the
Insane, at Logransport, Ind. ;i *-He was
there nearly . three years, but he 'con-
tinued to fjrow worse, so* we ! = brought
him home July 30, . 1902, In ; an \ awful
condition. He had lost his mind almost
entirely. He hardly knew one of the
family; could not even flnd^ his bed;
was a total wreck. He had from 5 to
10 fits a day. We were .urged 'to try
Dr. Miles', Nervine, and before. the first
bottle was used, we could see a chance
for the better. We have given It '- to
him ever since, and he has had but
two very light spells since last August.
1903, and then he was not .well I other
ways. We pronounce him cured, as he,
can work and go anywhere. If any one j
wishes to ask any questions concerning
this, they are at liberty to doro." 1 " .:

clares Carl Joubert.
LONDON. July 4. â Carl Joubert,
thor of m.my well-known books on
Russia and who has recently returned
from that country, in an Interview to
day said: J*y/
"From the Baltic to the Black Sea
Russia is mad â mad with, misgovern
ment, mad with brutality, mad with
hunger and when 140,000,000 people
are mad together there can be no
peace. There must ; be paroxysms and
there must be. slaughter before triere
can bÂ« Deace. .
"From one end of Russia, to the' other
there Is butchery and bloodshed, but
very soon there will be scenes with
which the horrors of the French revo
lution will not compare. .The Czar Is
the last of his race. Not , a Romanoff
will survive. The mutiny, ln the Black
Sea Is only part of a general revolu
tion. The Crimea is rising; and Poland
has still to be reckoned with. Finland
will fight for. her freedom and from
St. Petersburg to Odessa there will be
official heads hanging. upon the trees."

i BERKELEY. July 4.â A desperate lezp
i for, life from en upp->r rooza was forced
I upon Ctar:Â«s WagEer asd bi* wife ttiJ

thzfUxas eij^rience oi being torsed to

tzUmie to dfcatroy tiiea drori-e the frantic
family from room to room of their bocse
oa Ninth street. Tbey preferred to run
ttfe risk ct fatal injurie* from a fall to
certain death in the blazing hosse.
Each or the faxatly escaped with life,
although all were brcUtd badly, while
Mr. Wagner's anna and baxuL* were
gashed In a *cere of places as the result
of bii work in (smUsK a window to pro-
Tide esrÂ«ss for fcliseelf acd ctnnpanlona. -
U'agaer Is an Â«usfseâ¬r. whose home ad-
Jclr.ii the jjrcc*ry itore of C. H. Hadlen on
Sirr.L etreet, between Channlag and
Dwight way. He was awakened about Z
o'clock thlÂ» rooming by the roaring of
Cajafg and the craekl'm of tltsber In his
house. He arose and burrftd tato the
hallway to learn bow serious the' danger
frosj fl*e might be. At osc* he reaSxed
that the entire family was la great peril,
ax the entire lower Coor was afire and
Â«*rery means of ordinary exit wa* closed-"
Wagner made his way into the bedroom
ct hie little dacght-r. Ellen, and dragged
bÂ«x out. Tfcea he went from room to
roc-in. tryii^r in dÂ«rpÂ£ir to device tome
method cf retting away from the bouse
and the -Caraea wlthoct haTing to imny
tmra. the windows. The auest for a way
out was fruitless.
With cc time to loee, Wegner and h!Â»
wife finally decided to throw their bed
dothfcsr to the ground, end then to Jump
for life and safety. Wagner saoashed In
the window, tiÂ» tjtn&s and arms being
cot frightf clly In the act. Flames were
dartlsg 'their fiery tongues at them, how
-ever, and thus pursued, Wagner waa ln
&Jfferfnt to ccta or g&zh+*.
3HÂ«. Wagner made the first leap and
landed safely, being but slightly Injured,
tb* ssattr-Â« and bed covering* breaking
the force of the fall. Then the little
cfcild was tcÂ«*d out, and waj caught by
the mother. The father followed. All
were injured, tbo-ugh none seriously.
A telephore message was sent to the
Fire Department and tbÂ« Beacoa company
Tt^xa&eH, but the bouse could not be
saved- It wu totally destroyed. The loss
is estimated at **W>; Insurance, C3OO.

Bztcial Dlcp&tch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. July 4.â Ever since the
announcement that President Roosevelt
had summoned Elihu Root for a consul
tation within two hours after learning of
John Hay's death, Mr. Root's name has
been frequently mentioned in connection
with the talk as to Mr. Hay's successor.
It U known that when, several months
Â«Â£o. It looked as if Secretary Hay would
have to give up his post, the President
eald to several that In that event he
would like to have Mr. Root back again.
The unprecedented action of taking Mr.
Root to the Hay funeral with him to rep
resent the Department of State has
strengthened the report that the ' New
York lawyer will re-enter the Cabinet at
the President's request. The Instructions
to Secretary Taf t to proceed on his trip
to th# Philippines are in the same line.
The only others mentioned as likely to
eecure the vacant portfolio are former
Embassador Choate and former Embas
cador Porter and it is conceded that if
Mr. Root can be Induced to make the sac
rifice of his law practice he will be the
next Secretary of State.

GREAT SURPLUS
MAY BE DIVIDED
Obscure Clause in the, New
Jork Insurance Law Said
to Affect : the Equitable
LAWYERS FIND i^OKER"
Claim $78^)00,000: Must Be
Distributed to Deferred
Dividend Policy Holders
Special Dlapatch *o The Call.
NEW. YORK. July 4-Through an ob
scure and hitherto ignored clause in the
insurance law, a revolution in the insur
ance world is now threatened. High legal
authorities claim they have discovered
that all of the deferred dividend policies.'
constituting two-thirds of the risks out
standing against the New York compa
nies, are and always have been illegal.
Tha matter has been presented to Super
intendent Hendricks with .the request
that he* proceed to compel the Equitable
to distribute the $78,000,000 surplus of
that company among holders of deferred
dividend policies, to whom the enormous
fund Is said to belong.
Probably 300,000 policy holders would
share in this distribution, should. Hen
dricks take action.
The law which now promises to add 10
per cent to the value of each of these
policies is a piece of ; "sneak" legislation
passed seven years ago, .through the ef
forts of the late Henry B. Hyde. The
bill contained a "Joker" which was sup
posed by its authors to give * them-au
thority to hold back the company's
profits from its policy holders and accu
mulate them for personal ends. The law
which is depended upon now to right the
wrongs of nearly forty years was enacted
In ISSB and has been incorporated in stat
utes of that year as section 87. It reads:
"The company shall make or pay over
dividends annually or at longer intervals
In the manner and proportion and among
parties prescribed in the charter."
The charter of the Equitable provides
that the dividends ehall be distributed
among the policy, holders who have paid
premiums for five years.
doubtless be present as a mark of the
respect and esteem â¢in which the late
Secretary was held on the European
continent. > ji
Mr. and Mrs. Payne Whitney, the lat
ter, a daughter of the late Secretary,
arrived in London, last evening and
were met at the railroad station by
Embassador Reid and the members 5 of
the American embassy. Mr. and. Mrs.
Whitney have not decided on/ their
plans, but they will probably return
to the United States immediately. They
received the news of the Secretary's
death from Embassador Reid by, wire
less telegraphy on Sunday * night and
wero greatly distressed, as -when they
left home Mr. Hay appeared to have
much improved.
The Embassador has canceled an en
gagement to be present at the dinner
of the Hardwlck Society on July 6, at
which he was to be the guest of honor.
Mr. Reid and his associates in the em
bassy will also be absent from the
court ball on- July 7.

THE ASSUAN DAM.
SINCE the English engineers built the Assuan dam in Egypt
to impound the waters of the Nile for distribution in irrigation
to land lying above the flood plane of the river, that structure
has become a 'figure of speech in irrigation oratory in this country.
The ambition of constructors has been to equal or exceed the Assuan
e dam on some of. the* Government irrigation work now in progress
in our arid regions. f"^. '.
So recently that the matter has not heretofore had place m
the American press, the operation of the Assuan dam has developed
a new physical law of such structures, that must be taken, into con
sideration by our engineers.- Of course the weight of the impounded
v water is exerted upon the base of the dam. The mathematical theory,
heretofore held has been that- this pressure will cause the dam to
'yield and crack horizontally. Therefore every device, has been
adopted to guard against these horizontal cracks: When, that is done
â¢ the structure has been regarded as proof against the thrust caused
. by the weight of water. '
When the* Assuan dam was built these safeguards against hori
zontal cracking were increased so as to sustain an increase 'in the
height of the dam, if that should be found desirable. The time came
when this seemed necessary, and the Government had prepared for
raising the masonry so as to raise the water level in the ..reservoir*
twenty feet. There was no reason why this should not be done,
granting the theory to be true that masonry dams crack horizontally
only. Such dams" have a slope on the water side.- It is; now dis
covered that the pressure tends to crack this slope perpendicularly
instead of horizontally, tilting the dam inward while the water, es
caping through the perpendicular breach, finally destroys the whole
structure.
â¢ From this it is apparent that all of the protection of the * Assuan
Mam from the horizontal cracking was thrown away. li the water
pressure is sufficient to finally destroy the" perpendicular integrity of
the structure, there is no remedy except to tear it down and recon
struct it. Under these circumstances the engineers are searching
* for a site for a second dam, to impound the extra water, the weight]
â¢ of which they dare not add to the pressure that is already on the
Â« Existing structure.
The discover}.'- of this new law of pressure by water upon
c masonry dams is "timely, in the interest of the vast Federal irriga
tion works now in progress, and planned in this country. The As
suan dam will serve as something more than a figure of speech, if.it
furnish an example in structure that will save our dams from de
struction. Sir Benjamin Baker, -the consulting engineer of the
Assuan dam, says that it will take two years to either determine
the integrity of that structure or! begin the second dam which is
under consideration. But he says philosophically/ "I do not con
sider the postponement a bad thing, if only because it will stop
speculation in land. Private speculators have forced the price up
to $146 and in some cases $^86 per acre." ',
Our Government has taken every precaution to prevent land
speculation in the regions it is irrigating. Indeed, it is still a ques
: tion whether these precautions have not been overdone to such an
extent as to make the actual settlement of the^ lands difficult. As
soon as a settler takes possession of the land he must begin paying
the Government for the water that is necessary to irrigate his whole
tract. On a" homestead of 160 acres this amounts to $400 a year. It
* is impossible for the average settler to. put his whole tract in a
. profitable and permanent. crop, like alfalfa, in one year, or five
2 years.. The land must be ditched^ and checked, at a cost of. not; lgss'
than $7 per acre, and if the settler prepare4n that way forty acres
his first year, he will strain himself to do it. : Then the yield' is not
\ immediate, and his situation requires that he must have capital on
hand to a larger amount than is usuaPwith homesteaders.^ ;Â£ ~ y
. What seems to be needed to shut off such speculation as that
in Egypt, and at the same time give the settlors a fair chance for a
start, is, that the Government should make Hhem' pay only for the
water they use. If the first year a man is able to ditch, check, seed
and irrigate twenty acres, make him pay for twenty acres. As lie
. extends his operations and irrigates more land, let the water be paid
for. When his total acreage is under cultivation or is made- useful
to him by irrigation, let it be paid for. Of course .this would \u25a0extend.
â¢ the time for returning the revolving fund to the beyond
the period fixed by law. But if settlement of the land is not made
possible by reasonable regulations, none of it will ever be returned.
In the Egyptian land speculation there is light thrown upon the
value of irrigated lands in California. The climate of Egyp{ has no
gifts and graces greater than that of California. If land, therefore,
' in Egypt can be sold under irrigation at from $146 to $486 per acre
what is as eood land under a better climate in California worth?-
COLLEGE MEN AND WOMEN.
/STATISTICS in regard to the relative scholarship of the men
\- and the women students at the leading universities of the
S^ country have been collected by the Chicago Record-Herald,
and the result of the showing is that the iyb'meiv distinctly outclass \
the men. Sixteen prominent co-educational institutions gave' re-;!
ports and among them there was only one .where the men showed
superiority, and in that case, the University of Wisconsin, it was
deemed very surprising that the men vvere ahead, for statistics 01
the former j'ears showed that in the literary deparlments the' men
and women have been evenly matched. 5
At this, the graduating season of the year, ; tho-fact of this fem
inine superiority gets prominence. r We may' regard it as "certain
that on the average the women who. are .to pass from college halls
out into the world of practical efforts are superior to the men in the
success of their intellectual training; the unsolved part of the prob-'
lem is, Will theybe as successful in life work as the men? If they,,
on leaving college, can make their higher efficiency in taking the
training that fits for'Jife hold good* to- higher achievements in' the
world's ; work, will this result in making the world better? It^ is
perhaps only in s the thought that it will that man can find balm. for,
the wound to his intellectualpride caused by his average inferiority
to women in the classes.
One of the records which most readily shows that men are not
keeping up in scholarship, with women is that of the: Phi". Beta
Kappa Society, whose standard is that of scholarship ' alone! In
the University' of Chicago 13^ per cent of^thewomen woii -'the honor"
of election . to the society, but only 8.5 per cent of r theT men \ suc
ceeded. -This- test -gives women the advantage throughout^the
reports.-, -v-.-: ~ : ) ;\u25a0\u25a0.\u25a0}'\u25a0...:. ,:*- \u25a0 \u25a0 '\u25a0.- \u25a0. -\u0084- \u25a0 . ".â¢' ' :
Â»\u25a0.Â» \u25a0 . In this comparison of men's and women's brains perhaps.' the"
report from Stanford University comes closest to what "is the truth
of the whole matter. There, in the department of liberal arts, the
women are .superior to the men in; their scholarship/, but in every
class, there arc three or four men superior "to . any of the .women.
That summing up is in general accord with the- world's % history:
Women equal men or "may even surpass them "'; -in averagelattain
ments, but there are - always a few men of; pre-eminent t iritell ect
whose achievements are beyond 1 feminine rivalry. Whether this

FRENCH WOMEN THE WOOERS
They Appear-,tq ; tie Satisfied With the Inferior; Position

DOROTHY FENIMORE
PARJS, June 13. *
THE, world -of Paris is emphatically
a man's world. "Make _way; for
the laflics," : though A originally a
French ' phrase, is nothing more op
French soil than a : polite formality, which
has nothing in common. with the spirit of
chivalry which .animates the manhood of
the Anglo-S*cob race. \u25a0''\u25a0*.
In the. ordinary, course of French so-,
clal life this relation between men and
women is perhaps -more ".evident from
woman's attitude toward man,: than", from
man's attitude I toward woman. % One can
see with half -an tyo that; she 'regards
him as her lord - and | master, that | she
realizes that it is through his favor only
that she can gain the good things of life
which she desires.' ": r :l ' ' ; ; â¢ - .
'What strikes. me as most characteristic
in tue situation ls^that r it aeems, to b6
woman's part to do the wooing,'? to prof
fer the little courtesies and. tokens, 'of
affection which in our. own land women
expect, land regard' as their right, from
husband or sweetheart. ; \u25a0 .
5 .The- masculine attitudes-while" not ex
-actly " indifferent..; is con'sprcu'wisly â¢ toler

self to be amused and enticed by feminine
charms. ". He is Zeus on - Olympus, and
even \u25a0 the woman ' whom - he loves .is no
.more than his handmaid. ? -.; . v - : : " \u25a0' '\u25a0>-,;, â¢:.

It recalls the. state of . affairs | which
existed in the eleventh and twelfth;cen
turies, and which*. we find* celebrated . in
those chansons de geste. of â¢; this period
wherein love plays a part; "Then it was

GOOD RACING
AT INGLESIDE
The annual Independence Day races of
the San Francisco Driving Association at
Ingleslde yesterday were unusually close
and interesting. The most sensational
feature of the afternoon's sport was a
neck and neck finish by .Welleday, Lady
i Jeffries and King V in the second heat
of the second race. \u25a0
As usual some of the amateurs caused
almost interminable scoring to the - un
concealed disgust of the grandstand. A
| more generous distribution of fines by the
executive officers of the association would
prove beneficial to the game. Abrams
had a couple of books which did a large
business in Email sums. 'About 2000 peo
ple were in attendance.
The result of the races follow:

honors went to Fred Adams of San

â¢ The morning match was between
Miss Ethel Ratcliffe and Miss -Sarita

' _ Miss Ratcliffe won quite easily. The
r .score in Miss Ratcliffe' s favor was
â¢f-3, 6-3. Miss Hazel Hotchkiss. the
â¢ holder, was not present to defend her
tjtle, which went to Miss Ratcliffe by
; default.
The flna's of the men's tournament
] was played In the afternoon and al
though Harry Rolfe was beaten in
straight sets the match was close and
interesting:. Adams was in much bet
tct condition than Rolfe and did not
seem to mind the heat at all. Aside
-trora this he played better tennis than
"Rolte and his victory was merited. The
sc>/>re was 6-2. 7-5, 12-10.
.' In the second set Rolfe won four
out of the first five games and led at
40-3Â© la the sixth. This was as close
as he came to winning the set, as
Adams took the next four games easily.
Ttolfe evened up the score at E-6, but
Adams won the next two games and
*et. Rolfe appeared "all in" after the
second set and one and all thought he
uould make little or no showing in the
third set. He surprised the spectators
; by again taking four out of the first
five -games, but this set was a repeti
tion of the second set. Adams seemed
to play better when he w&s behind and
.sgain ran the score up to 5-4 in his
favor. Rolfe came back at him and
annexed thÂ« next two games, giving
Mm a lead of 6-5. Adams led at 8-7
and 40-15 and the match looked to be
ajÂ»out all over. '/"â¢ >
Rolfe fought desperately and pulled
out this game and also the next. The
pcore was 30-20 in the eighteenth game.
-Rolfe needing but two points to win
the set. Adams took this game, but
the next went to Rolfe. The score
stood 10-9 in Rolfe's favor, but he was
becoming more tired each moment, and
Adams ran out the next three, games
easily. .
Neither Â«f the contestants ever cut
a prominent figure in tennis Up to the
tournament ju*t completed. Adams has
advanced rapidly and Is the most prdm
â¢lsinjg Player on the coast to-day." He
played remarkably good . tennis
throughout the tournament, but it was
his wonderful stamina that carried him
through to victory. Rolfe ' deserves
\u25a0exeat credit for his gameness and. the

YANKEE COLORS
WAVE ON HICH
HENLEY, Eng., July 4.â The i crew of
the Vesper .Boat Club of Philadelphia
celebrated Independence Day in' England
ITy winning its 'heat against' the best uni
versity crew competing at Henley "this
year and by making the best time of any
eight. Indeed, all Henley seemed to be
celebrating the. Fourth of July. American
flags were flying all over the pretty
Tharhts-Simonds and as the. American
boat ' swept on jto victory, -the Stars and
Stripes were waved'from all. parts of the
grandstands. The shores were filled with
a record .gathering ; . of Britishers arid
American visitors. Â»:-,-.. -."
The great contest; between; the Vespers
and the -Leanders to-morrow . unciuestlon-'
ably- will be the most Intensely, interest
ing event, 0 from the international as well
as the -oarsman's viewpoint, ever 'known
at Henley; "The ; most expert critics or
rowing differ in their opinions,' and the
Englishmen hold that the American style
cannot prevail over that of . Leander, on
the ground : that; the .Americans -use; a
Eculling . style and fall |to put in body
weight - - \u25a0".'' \u25a0-;>.':.. \u25a0 :.,;.'/
In j to-day's results, however, when the
club NatiQue .of Belgium r beat the
Thames Rowing Club by ; using much, the
same style .with short, bars. ! the ; blades
of . which are small : and similar, to ; those
of the Americans, :the, theories "of, the
rowing eharps ,wrre ; upset;; arid Jconse-;
quently to-night there is 1 much guessing
over, to-morrow's ; struggle; .which un
questionably will decide who will be the
winner of. the;' Grand > Challenge Cup,
though the .successful ; crew will row
against the' Club Natiqiie.'
Coach :DempÃey of the" Vespers said to
tho 'Associated Press: to-night: 'VI * be
lieve' the American style to ;be much bet

The Siberian railway is ! Important as a
military road.' but it was constructed with
commercial 'development | in {mind.l :It
crosses; all the greats rivers flowing north
through Siberia- near Â« the' head of f navi
gation, r thus affording an outlet;; tori all
the .valleys. .It; constitutes' the shortest ;
route from European capitals to Asiatic
trade ; centers, and :it will command the i
trade of ; Siberia and * northern, China. - i
v The Trahs-Caspian railroad [system has
great;strategic value in caseVof war, but
it was constructed to command the trade

routes through Kashgar, Samarcand and
Merv.- jlf peace should .prevail for! twen
ty-flve years Merv would become the mid
way station, between -Calcutta r and the'
Black Sea; 'the German railway \ through

In a certain town of Connecticut a dea
con of the church, ; charged with solicit
ing .subscriptions \u25a0 for a charity, recently
experienced considerable difficulty In "get
ting! the townsmen to contribute. To. one
of his neighbors the deacon said: ,-\u25a0
A'Oh, come, Richard, do give some
thing." .
"Sorry, deacon," ' answered Richard;
"but I don't see how I can."
"Why not?. Isn't the cause a good
one?"
"Oh, yes, the cause is good enough; but
I owe too much money."
I "But," Richard, you owe God a larger
debt than any one else."
V "That's ' true, too," drawled Richard^

In choosing a family dog (for the

carefully considered â intellect,^ temper

for, to .fill' this all-aisound position re
quires as eclectic a combination of at
tributes as to be adaptable ; and gen
erally useful in any other -walk of life!
The hunting dog learns' one trade, but
the family dog must know; half a.doz
en: and "not. only this, biit t he must {be
an independent, dog of
manners and In full control of his"hab
its, that" he may. have '; t he run', of ; the
place Indoors^and out, -like any -other
member, of the family. In this the
family dog is distinct from Ihe purely
pet animal, who/ from receiving abnor-i
mal care ..and the enervation: ; of*, too
much humanizing, v often ; -'J degenerates
into; a nuisance instead *of
and maintaining, the highest! canine at

WARSAW, JulK 4.â The most hated
and ) most dreaded spot ; in Jall>Warsaw is
the Citadel, once ; a ; fortress, ; but now. a
political A'-orison, T behind .the walls, of
v/hich ; many srim and terrible J tragedies
are .. enacted. "',--â¢\u25a0 Many ; a â¢, Warsaw family jis
mourning "a "husband, father, son. -or even
daughter, ywho has been dragged away
by the~j gendarmes at; dead : 'of 'night-. and
imprisoned there. Many of them are lost
forever. ; Their fate is never iknown. â¢; It
may be death, transpcrtatlon-to Siberia
or exile. ..." ; â¢ . '. ; ...*.." . ,- ;
-Since: the three days'. reign ; of terror in
January^,repdrts ;;of -wholesale l butchery
at; the: Citadel have; horrified Warsaw.
According; to these" repbrte,: men and;.wo
men; are hanged "almost daily. .The > fish
ermen living hard :by hear strange 'muf
fled i cries : comins . from ; ; the walls .- of : the
prison ; the Russian officers " themselves
return' pale * and. trembling . from the
scenes their duty forces them to witness.
How many men d and women have been
executed rin the Cltadel\since last Feb
ruary, \u25a0; when . the Y present ''movement
against the Czar's Government reached
Poland.'i nobody but the. Commandant and
the' Governor ever will -know. \" ;
; Though the > barracks "vacated ,by regi
ments *; lately sent to the front are used
for political suspects, the -Citadel- is so
pvercrowded that the daily court-martials
cannot make : room i for the newcomers
quickly enough. ' .
"THE n ASTILE OF POLAND." .
The few who :Veturn" therefrom say lit
tle. \ for they 'dare not tell . the truth. But
their -drawn, faces, shattered nerves and
bruised bodies speak ;, for,; themselves.
Little wondeV that :this> Citadel" has been
called the Bastile- of Poland; t littlewon
der.*,that I the Pole J shudders. lat | its red
walls and green ramparts.; Not only is it
the slaughter house â¢of i his' race, but its
guns, ever 'f turned < toward* the r city, \u25a0â¢ are
ready to vomit. fire at the first- signs of a
general risings against 'the, Russian
stranger within its gates. ,- vV-C-:'.;
; Built by " Russian -hands but with Polish
gold : after the^ revolution of ;1563,; 1S63,- the
Citadel forms the. apex of the triangular
shaped fortifications that stretch from
the Prussian; to : the' Austrian , frontiers. 1
It is , to ". Roland what thfe fortress of Sts.
Peter, and Paul in Pc tersbur g ; is *to Rus
sia. Should this; country, .ever,.... escape
I from "â¢ the Russian yoke the prison will
meet the same fate as the Bastile during
the French. revolution of 1759.
Following? the broad road which^runÃ
parallel with the river, ; Â£he ordinary vis
itor to the . Citadel finds himself confront-.
1 ed by a gateway, flanked by .fortifications
and guarded by,. sentries. Let us .sup

! look at it fcritically and finally > let you

; surprise at -the- homelike' atmosphere
around â¢ you. ; There " are - no ' gray walls or
lowering towers. % Warm, ';. red brick pa-
Vifions. a; : gold-domed "church, well-swept
walks | and grass plots : flanked by - cannon

SUFFERINGS OF WOMEN.
That is all for ; U.e casual,, visitor. ' But
suppose the visitor is a Poie^-arrested for

BEATINGS FOR THE STUBBORN.
- \u25a0- Now the second part of the exami
nation begins. The prisoner is shown
scraps , of paper, bits of , letters and
not es^ made at political meetings taken
from his own rooms. This, is one of
the most difficult examinations ..to. an
swer. He- must make some reply to
the gendarmes*, questions,', for ,'taÂ»lÂ»
eyes are fixed; on his fape. : Some mÂ«n
go on the f principle"of - pretending not
to recognize any handwriting,; even
their "own. ; . Of course, when; the wily
gendarme 'points .this ; out .to] him his.
confusion is doubled^ and "^be- chances
are he will admit knowing a * hand he
has never seen before."'!-
When he has been driven "to the
verge of . madness by a series of such
questions, one of the ., gendarmes will
produce albums, filled with photographs
of people he knows, very." often of
members of- his own. political party."
What is a man; to do when confronted
with*. the gendarme's questions. "Do you
know this person? Have you no recol
lection of that face?" If he tells the
truth he will betray his party; . If he
lies, .one- of * the gendarmes smilingly
will tell him .he recognized the ; hand
writing iof the original five minutes
ago^ ; ; . â¢ "; \u25a0 ',-\u25a0â¢* , .'-.\u25a0.';-" .* "'
Sometimes a prisoner will say he has
never seen the original of sa whole
album : full, of only to be
told that his own brother's was among
them, andi. that asjhe Is evidently tired,
they,:. had better: gV'through\-the falbum
once more. . -â¢ . '#'
-i.; All the time one gendarme Is show
ing^him' the photographs, ; the, other Is
watching-;.-: his fac^ - and a Russian
gendarme can . read faces like - a book.
N lf c the l- prisoner is. obstinate about an
swering, which, generally happens, he
and his: hosts part angrily, the .â¢warders
arc called In : and hustle him back to
his dark cell, where he, ls 'left ..to his
reflections . for' a. few days, or-- even
weeks. , But his. examinations always
take place -in the "pretty sitting-room
and he. - is ,r, r always confronted with fa
miliar.handwritings and photographs. V
V After" several. : such : examinations,
alternated, by 1 dreary days ,ln" the cell.
he Is taken to a small room^hung wrth
mirrors and gloomy, draperies." He ha 3
scarcely time, to_ get overthe shock of
his .altered appearance 'when a man,
dressed In black, (emerges from behind
a curtain 'and plies him with questions.
If \ th* 'suspect ; refuses ' to the
manjxilaps "his hands and a couple .of
ruffiansenter with\whips and beat him.
An .J. J obstinate $ prisoner is sometimes
beaten; till i: he : loses - consciousness -. and
then .: removed to ' his J cell, ay bleeding
mass. \u25a0
(Sometimes' 'the suspect Is : " simply
oliarged with belonging to a secret pollti-'
cal society and confronte'd'by oiie of his
own colleagues who. 'unknown .to him,
is a spy 'arid/ has betrayed : the *- whole
party.' ; But ;even back in . his cell he Is
not left -. ln peace. ' He hears \u25a0 taps on" the
other side; of the wall and, after \u25a0 !ang
labor, manages to make out a f rough,

Captain ot : Police Martin, who ordered a
policeman to lock up Fitzpatrtck at the Har
bor . station. _ . ...
eral such examinations, . he . is either re
leased' for want of evidence or put
through the mockery of a' trial. A mock
ery because, though the procurator who
Judges Jilm' allows him : legal counsel, hia
fate Is sealed "beforehand. The tr.'al
takes place pet ore the Commandant of the
Citadel, /the ..procurator,, the .gendarmes
employed. ln arresting and examining iÂ£&
prisoner, and, perhaps a renegade frcm
his party, who gives evidence Tor. tha
prosecution. There Is no evidence for Â«h<*
defense, but the prisoner's counsel â¢ ha^
the right to confer with his cllent.'in hi 3
cell, "of course, and in the preaer.ee Â«f
warders.*.
If the sentence passed Is death,' thÂ«
prisoner is hanged in the Citadev *irt
consigned .tp ; a nameless grave. Thta
grave is; generally . dug within the pre
clncia cf-the fortress.. bit more often tha
remains of the ucfortunate vlctlTii \u25a0 are
taken to the Brudrlo Cemetery, across the
Vistula,. and outside the city boundaries.
If,' however, - the ; sentence Is Imprison
ment the victim passes. the~ term In thÂ»
Citadel; if exile, he H sent jo Siberia and
outlawed. But even if he'la lucky enough
to leave the Citadel, a frae man. the
chances are that the police will sbaiiow
him for the rest of his life.

FATHER MURDERS DAUGHTER
AND THEN COMMITS SUICIDE
Holds Girl Until Gas
Overcomes
Them Both.
Mother Is Crazed
: When Told of
s Tragedy.
Is Left With Five
Small Children
Support.
â¢
.' Despondent because of poverty, Hen
ry Heine turned on the gas on himself
and his pretty 14-year-oid daugnter,
Charlotte, on Monday night in his home
at 4026 Twenty-sixth street.
'. Cruel bruises on the girl's arms and
bead Indicate that the father held her
until the fumes overcame both. Heine*
death leaves his widow and five young,
.children destitute. When the mother,
who had been working as a nurse.
heard of the tragedy, she was so over
come by grief and despair that she
.fcad to be taken to the detention ward
lit the Central Emergency Hospital.
- The five other children, Louis, i 12
years of age; Helen, 10; Henry, 7; Jo
hanna, 5. and John, 2, were sleeping in
adjoining rooms, but heard nothing.
* About ten o'clock little Johanna opened
the door of the room where her .father
and elder sister slept. The child was
almost overcome by the fumes of the
e&s that rushed through the open door
and filled the house.
' She screamed loudly and the other
children ran to the doorway. "Papa!
- Charlotte!" they called.
: No reply came from the still forms
on the bed. The children shrieked in
alarm and neighbors called Policeman
Stanton. Father and daughter were
"both dead when he arrived and he re
* ported the case : to the Morgue.-.
.. Heine was at one time in the grocery
business, but failed. Of late he had
' been employed as a carpenter's helper.
He found it hard to earn' enough at his
sew trade to support his large 'family,
and the eldest girl, Charlotte, was sent
to work to help.
.â¢ The mother, too, was forced to seek
employment as a nurse. She was away,
attending a patient, when the tragedy
When told that her husband
was dead she exclaimed. "My God!
What will I do now?"
Her grief was bo violent that Police
man Stanton. who broke the news to
â¢her, deemed it unsafe to permit her to
be at large. She was taken to the
Central Emergency Hospital and her
fij-e children were- taken with her.
According to the wife, Heine had
been a heavy drinker and had lost sev
eral .positions through. his indulgence.
But lately, she insists, .he had not been
drinking. She attributes his act to des
pondency caused by brooding over his
poverty. The child he killed was his
favorite. It was always a thorn In thÂ«
father's side that Bhe had to "work
out." Late last night Heine entered the
room where his daughter was sleeping.
It is certain that the girl was awak
ened by the smell of the gas and that
she made a desperate struggle for her
young life. But the crazed parent paid
no heed to her pleadings. He held her
until the gas overcame him and he sank
down beside her.
Charlotte was a remarkably well de
veloped girl for her age. She had been
working for several months in a book
bindery, and her wages did much to
\u25a0vard supporting the family.
It was some time before the mother
was told that the girl was dead. When
ehe heard that the mainstay of the fam
ily was dead It was feared that she
would lose her reason altogether.
Heine was a native of Germany â¢ and
â¢was 44 years of age. vi

People are. beginning to realize that . the ;
: Victor is a musical instrument-^the most
wonderful of. all musical instruments-rfor' it
reproduces them all.
Its, work is so perfect that experts in an
â¢ adjoining room have been' unable to tell C
from two selections (one on the' 'Victor. and v.
one by the performer himself) which was .'
"Every day callers at our store marvel
at the perfection of the Victor, and often we
hear them say, "VVhy, I always 'thought â¢

WOMAN VISITED
BY A BURGLAR
Mrs. . Bessie Lane, who occupies a room
in the Prescott House. 933 Kearny, street,
was awakened about 2 o'clock yesterday
morning by some one* feeling her. ears
as If in search of earrings. '.'What do
you want?". she inquired. It was so'dark
she could see no one.
A man's voice- replied: "I want your
jewelry and coin and if you make any
noise I'll throttle you." She assured him
she had no jewelry of. any value (> or coin
and said she, would not make an, outcry,
but - she raised her hand and pressed an
electric button at the top of her bed to
attract the attention of E. Peake, the
night clerk. . . ,' ; .
Peake responded to the call and when
the burglar. heard his approaching foot
steps he ran out of the room and tried
to make his escape /through a rear win
dow. He got' on the porch and Peake,
who had followed him, grappled with him.
They struggled on the porch, each trying
to throw the other over the . railing to
the yard. ..Peake at one time was hanging
over the railing, but by a superhuman ef
fort forced^ himself back and threw the
burglar to the floor.
Policeman J.E. Ward and Special Offi
cer S. Daggett were attracted'by the cries
of some of the other roomers and hurried
to the scene. " They found Peake on top
of the burglar. ..who was struggling to get
out of his clutches. _ The handcuffs were
soon over . the wrists ' of; the ' midnight
marauder. ..-He gave the name : of A. M.
Smith, which is supposed to be fictitious.

$HE;?S^
ARE REPAIRING
RUSSIAN SHIPS*
According to the officers of the British
steamer Waddon, which spent a few.
hours in this harbor yesterday, among
the war vessels \ flying the Japanese flag
at the recent famous battle- of the Sea
of Japan was -at least one
destroyer which not long ago sailed under
the 'flag- of the "Czar.
The Waddon came here from Sasebo
by way of Puget Sound. She was at the
Japanese naval base delivering 7000 tons
of. Cardiff coal for the Japanese Govern
ment. In the harbor were several; Rus
sian war. vessels captured at Port Arthur,
among them' a battleship, a big ifour
stadk cruiser and several smaller vessels.
Little brown mechanics were at work on
all the prizes, repairing with all possible
haste the damage done by Japanese
shells.
- Among the vessels captured at Port
Arthur was a torpedo-boat destroyer.
This valuable little souvenir was given a
trial trip during the Waddon's ; stay, at
Sasebo and she proved a ; hummer i and
just as good as new. Before. the Waddon
sailed, the; former Russian . torpedo-boat
destroyer had been placed in commission
and was . ready %to join Togo's mosquito
fleet.
â¢The Waddon left Sasebo June 8 and the
day | after leaving sighted four Russian
cruisers. These vessels were painted lead
color; except 'their smoke stacks, ; which
were conspicuous in; black and .white
stripes. '.'\u25a0 ': v \u25a0
"The Waddon Is a new vessel, being now
on her second voyage. On her first voy
age she left England with a cargo of con

â¢ DIVISION IN FORTY-SECOND^'
In the Fortieth District Henry Ach will
handle the Ruef programme. The league
membership in the district is large ; and
well organized. i
JRuef arid the Mayor are not going out
of their way to invite trouble in ' the
Forty-first District. The Republicans of
the district went as far as they could go
for. harmony's sake when they consent
ed to J. H. Nelson's nomination for State
Senator. The present indications are that
Rucf will not put up a ticket in^the For
ty-first,-but will endeavor to place a few
men of his "choice on the regular ' ticket
of the .: league.
In the Forty-second Districfthe league
is strong, "but certain leaders who profess
to be; in sympathy, with the people's* flght
to oust the grafters 'are giving counte-*
nance to a "third ticket proposition.". The
citizens of the' district cannot- be easily
blinded. The -fact: is -obvious to every,
voter of ; ordinary intelligence that Ruef
bases his hope of success on division in
the ' Republican ranks.' 'All the citizens of
the : Forty-second who . are tired of rtuef
and loot and graft snould join the column
of >; the * Republican ; Leagued " . . *
Â« Jacob; Shaenf denies .the 1 statement re-,
cently made iin' a \u25a0 morning \u25a0 newspaper *in
this" city ; that,- he; intended -to ?put " up '&
flght against .the Republican League
ticket in the - Forty-fourth 'Assembly | Dis
trict. It iis quite well understood that he
is not '- applauding the \u25a0 committee of ten
selected under the auspicts of the league
to ' manage the â¢ campaign in that ' district/
hut he has no intention of .putting water
on Ruef's -wheel by placing. an independ
ent Republican ticket, in the field."
*-' George Boyne.will probably manage the
Ruef-Schmltz!. fight; in the Forty- fourth.
If lung power instead of votes could settle
the' controversy IJoyne * would' win in ? a
talk:' ." \u25a0â¢-..: ' \u25a0 \u25a0 v \u25a0,'" \u25a0 . â¢
i Ruef and Nelson will go to -the ballot
box !in the ; Forty T fif th. ; : The â¢ league ; pro
poses to ' give Ruef a ; flght : to . the Vflnish
in his = hon^e district.* .The boast of Ruef
that he . can â¢ swing the ; for any
thing ''. and i everything Is resented sby in
telligent : citizens. \u25a0" Ruef , Is , particularly
anxious Â« to .win s. the . Forty-fifth . so " that
he can name his own henchmen for. the
County^ Committee. ; He '\u25a0 perceives * that
Schmltz Is , fading, away and Is therefore
doubly .- anxious ' to ; keep some \u25a0 sort '^of Â» a

umn. ;Defeat ; of Ruef in : the , Forty-fifth
would be the hardest political jolt of his
career."/ . .' -.".-\u25a0\u25a0â¢ *
