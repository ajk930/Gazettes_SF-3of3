BUTTE. Sept. 2.â Advices from Miles
City to-night say that Professor W.
H. Utterbeck of the Carnegie Museum
at Pittsburg has unearthed the petri
fied remains of a gigantic dinosaur,
also termed triceratops, in the banks of
Hell Creek, Dawson County.
According to Utterbeck the discovery
is a valuable one and the most impor
tant made in years. Professor Utter
beck has brought one wa&onload of
the remains, weighing about 2500
pounds, to Miles City. Another ton of
the petrified bones still remains in the
Hell Creek banks. They are so deeply
imbedded that it will require several
more months for Utterbeck's force of
workmen to remove them.
" This dinosaur was about thirty feet
long'. Its head measured six feet " in
length and is five feet wide. Two years
ago a Mr. Hornady of the New York
tJeological Society found, the remains
.cf one of the animals. They were sent
East
"Utterbeck has found evidence that

Â¦Gold Is lteinq: Extracted
From a Blind Lode That
Js Fortv Feet in Width
â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call
SALT LAKE. Sept. 2. â Goldfield,
Xevwda, is witnessing the beginning of
a ruth such as no mining camp in the
"\\*m ha? seen in recent years. Already
a Ftempede has begun from all parts of
Nevada, and . the fever is likely to
spread to the surrounding States until
thÂ« best days at Virginia City will be
discounted.
FINDS REMAINS
OF DINOSAUR
The strike that has caused all the
excitement was made in the Sandstorm
<laim. in the north edge. of Goldfield.
The ore runs 5S000 in free -gold in an
enormous blind lode forty feet wide.
This value of $6000, it is claimed, has
never been equaled, and the extent of
â¢he ore body has intoxicated every man
within reach of the news with ideas of
fabulous fortunes.
When it is considered that ore run
ring $4000 in gold is so high grade that
it is not treated by the ordinary meth
ods of extraction, some idea of the
richness of the new find will be ob
tained. The Sandstorm ore will be
treated by the "wet" process, which
will necessitate its removal from Gold
field for treatment, because of the
scarcity of water in that camp.
The excitement at Goldfield is said
to surpass that caused by the great
V.~h!te Pine discovery of the early
sixties.

The ants mysteriously disappeared
last night.
Whether this was due to climatic
causes or to the formation of the soil
is not known. It is known, however,
that the farmers in the vicinity of

were kept, objected to their intro

there is'no proof that they are respon

Francis J. Heney, special assistant to
the Attorney General, last night spoke
as follows concerning the case:.
X few weeks ago United States Circuit Judxe
The defendants also resist removÂ«: upon
the grc.iind that section 1014 of the Revised
S;atunÂ» does not authorize the removal of a
defendant from one judicial district of th#
United Bute* to the District of Columbia for
trial. This question was presented In the cases
of In* re Buell. 3 Dill. IIS. Fed. case No. 2102.
and In re Benson. 130. Ked. 4<?6. and It was
held in both that section 1014 of the Revised
Statute*, when rend in connection with ether
ttatutes of the United SutÂ«Â«. gives ample
authority for such removal, and Judge Dillon,
delivering the opinion of the court in the first
case, used the following language, which 1
adopt as a,n expression of my own views:
'The District of Columbia Is not a sanctu
ary to which persons committing offenses
against the United States may fly and be
beyond the reach of Justice, nor is the Uw so
defective that perÂ»onÂ» . there Â¦ committing such
offenses and escaping or found elsewhere can
not be taken back there for trial."
I do not deem It necessary to discuss other
questions presented in the - brief of counsel,
many of them, such as those going to . the
jr.er* form of the Indictment, being for thÂ«
exclusive determination of the court In which
the indictment wai found. The others have
been fully considered and it will be ' sufficient
to cay that in my Judgment they are not suf
ficient to Juetlfy me In refusing to Issue the
warrant applied for. The application for war
rant of removal Is rranted. Â£S&i$55&M833B|
The court added that "to my mind it
Is clear that the word 'owner* as there
in referred to refers to one who holds
both the legal and equitable title to
patented lands-" The opinion then says:
My conclusion therefore upon this point is
that the defendants In combining together to
obtain the title to public lands of the '.ini'.i 1
States in exchange for lands to which thty
held only the naked |e*al title, the equittb!
titie thereto being in the States of Caltfun:!a
and Oreron. conspired to defraud the Â«Jr-'ted
States within the meaning of section 5149 of
the Rev'.K-l Statutes.
The court then points out that It was
the object of the alleged conspiracy
to enable the defendants to obtain a
perfect title to certain public lands in
exchange for school lands situated in
forest reservations, to which they held
"only naked legal title." The law un
der which the exchange of lands re
ferred to was to be made wa3 then
quoted.
The indictment is certainly subject to v-Â»ry
saÂ»ere criticism because of lack of prÂ»_"*lcn
and Mnrleness In its statement of facts; but
I think that upon cons'deration of all of Its
all-cations the first count may be construed
.- > charring in substance that the defendant*
entered into a conspiracy to obtain from tha
United States title to public lands situate out
xl<ie of forest reseri'atlons In exchanse lor
school landi within forest reservation!". anÂ«i
In the names of i.ersons whose application* to
purchase were to be supported by tns falÂ«J
and fraudulent affidavits referred to In the l.\
dUtinÂ»r.t.
If nuch lÂ» the true constructor! of the in
dictment th<re can be no doubt that it fuf
ficit-ntly chanres the defendants with a- con
spiracy to defmud the I*n1tÂ»d States out of
the title to the lands which It might â¢ Bive
in exchange for Fii?h fictitious title*. A patent
ituued !n the name of a fictitious person con
veys r.o title. It is not simply voidable, but
Is absolutely void. 7
The defendants rÂ»*ift removal and lnÂ«lÂ«t
that tli* facts set out in the indictment do
not FUfflcle-ntly charge them xvlth a eoti
rpiracy to defraud the t"nited States wlth'n
the meaning of section 5440 of the Revlsr-d
St&tStM. It !Â¦ well settled that in an ap
plication for a warrant o% removal under sec
tion 1014 of the Kcvifoi) Statutes it Is tne
duty of the Judg? to inquire into the suf
ficiency of the indictment, where ths applica
tion for removal Is based upon the Indictment
alone, and if in ruch cane the indictment does
not tharce an offense thj warrant should be
refused. Tlie ftrFt question then for consid
eration at thin time is that which relates to
the sufficiency of ihe indlctmtnt. Do the
fact* *ft fort 1 * In the flm count show that
defendants entered into a conspiracy to defraud
thÂ»- l.'mtt-d States out of the title to any of
Its :>ubÂ»c ian<ts? â¢ â¢ â¢
Continuing the opinion states
Judge de Haven stated that the ap
plication "of the United States Attor
neys for a warrant is under section 1014
of the Revised Statutes. The indict
ment contains forty. two counts, and
the first one, he says. Is the only one
that will be necessary to consider.
The opinion then cites the charges
against Hyde and Dimond of attempt
ing to "defraud the United States Gov
ernment out of large tracts of public
lands open to selection under the laws
of lieu lands included within the limits
of the forest reservations established
and to be established in the States of
California and Orepon." The specified
charges in the indictment are then
cited.
There were few persons present in
court in the forenoon when Judge de
Haven rendered his decision, and a tel
ephone message to Garret McEnerney
brought him to the scene. After court
had adjourned at the noon recess there
were lively times in and about the cor
ridors, it being reported that the de
fendants would be forced to take the
evening train for Washington did they
not succeed in staying proceedings or
securing bonds. After a consultation
with the prosecution and defense Judge
Morrow agreed to hear the petition to
day, but it is probable that the case
will be permitted to go to Washington
on the decision as rendered by Judge
de Haven.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday caused a sensation in the
case of the Government versus Henry
P. Dimond and Frederick A.
Hyde by deciding that they must
stand trial In Washington, D. C. He
answered the prarer of the United
States District Attorney and United
States Prosecutors Francis J. Heney
and Judge Pugh and furnished legal
definitions and interpretations that
were omitted in the decision of Judge
Lacombe of New York in the John A.
Benson trial.
According to the decision handed
down by Judge de Haven the defend
ants, Dimond and Hyde, charged with
having fraudulently secured lands be
longing to the United States, must be
taken Into custody of the United States
Marshal and removed to the District of
Columbia for trial. In the decision
handed down by the New York court
John A. Benson, arraigned on a similar
charge to that brought against Hyde
and Dimond. won his case against the
Government. Hyde and Dimond have
not been so lucky, and last evening
they spent the night In the custody of
deputy marshals pending the hearing
of the habeas corpus petition, that will
come before Judge Morrow of the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals
this morning at 9:30 o'clock.
was permitted to go to his
home on Jackson street with the deputy
assigned by Marshal Shine, and Dimond
retired to the seclusion of the Hotel
Plymouth. Bonds in the sum of 510.000
each were prepared for filing, with W.
R. Wheeler and W. R. Sherwood sure
ties for Dimond and H. C. Morris and
W. R. Sherwood securities for Hyde.
Garret W. McEnerney and Bert Schles
inger represented the defendant Hyde,
and Samuel Knight was in court for
Dimond. The bonds were not filed. It
being determined by the defense that
the accused go into custody pending
the hearing of the habeas corpus pro

scientific formula. Druggists *of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, but
always under original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the men to deal with when in need of 'anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-class pharmacy and the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a; fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long" years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of
Figs is an excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full
name of the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowel*, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or
over-eating," that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in^its effects -as
Syrup of Figs, and they. are glad to sell it because.it gives universal satisfaction. 5
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and tho
immense demand for. it, imitations have been madp, tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
sometimes have Ithe name â " Syrup of Figs" â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary -to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer, a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter his
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of
physicians' prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
" exist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company â
California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article'and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class ot
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

The Morning Post concludes a careful
survey of the four days' fighting with
an opinion that the battle of Liaoyang
will take Its place beside that of .Wa
terloo and believes tfcat "whether or
not Kuropatkin's force is able* to con
tinue its retreat it will be broken and
useless for some time to come."
The Russian view that General Kuro
patkin, by crossing the river, divided
the opposing forces, meets with slight
consideration, as It Is'polnted out that
all the Japanese units can -. ; attack
simultaneously from different direc
tions, which eliminates any advantage
to the Russian side and really aggra
vates the seriousness of their position,
the Japanese force being superior in
numbers. .
The suspense with which the devel
opments at Llaoyang are awaited could
be scarcely greater in Tokio that it
is in London.
KUROPATKIN'S "FORLORN HOPE"
The Daily Telegraph, .which hailed
the initial successes at Llaoyang with
the degree~of finality, now admits that
"it, is not inconceivable that Kuropat
kin. may extricate. ,a portion of his
forces,!' ' though this Is /characterized
as 'the "supreme "jeffort "of a.' forlorn
hope." Tlie' Daily 1 Telegraph continues:
'/One "of.. the most exciting problems
ever known in war has been narrowed
down to. one point, namely, whether
a part of the retreating army will suc-
The list of casualties in the fighting
before Liaoyang is growing and the
indications are that it will prove to.be
the bloodiest battle since the Franco-
Prussian war. The calculations of
casualties must include the losses since
August 23, for the contest has been
practically continuous since then. The
Japanese have already reported more
than 25,000 men In killed and wounded.
Nothing concerning the actual occu
pation of Llaoyang has been received
here. Official dispatches indicate that
the Russians were sUll in possession
of Liaoyang this (Friday) morning.
'Few details of ! the â¢ pursuit of; the
Russian right have been received here.
It- is evident that the Russians: are
moving back slowly," contesting the
ground and shielding their movement
as.'faV as possible. \
The fate erf the great bulk of., the
retreating Russian army hinges upon
the bravery and fortitude of its left
flank. Before falling . back General
Kuropatkin intended that his left, to
the eastward and northward of Liao
yang, should .be greatly strengthened
in the hope of . checking General Ku
roki's advance around his flank and to
protect his line of retreat and com
munication. The greater portion of
this protecting force seems to have
been massed in the neighborhood of
Heiyingtai, twelve miles northeast of
Llaoyang, where it was fiercely as-
sauited by General Kuroki at 11 o'clock
on Thursday morning. The result -of
this fighting is not known. If Kijrokl
wins and reaches the railroad, it/will
place the Russians in a serious predica

Yesterday the Japanese managed to
interfere, .seriously with the train ser

a direct assault upon Liaoyang itself,
but devoted their energies to the troops
outside the city and an effort to cut off
the Russian Vetreat. Liaoyang is
strongly fortified jj and it is probable
that the Japanese will, not attack the
city directly until they have succeeded
in isolating It. Should the Russians
abandon Liaoyang, the Japanese, of
course, will enter.
General Kuroki's right is continuing
to press the attack at He'.yingtai, seek
ing gicmr.d whence its guns will domi
nate the railroad. The troops under
General kuroki are jaded and weary.
Th^y have been marching and fighting
since August 23, but in spite of this
they altackt-d with spirit. The Japanese
are confident that they already- have
swept l>aek 'the strong Russian force
with which they have been engaged,
and |t is probable that when the details
are known it will be found that 'a great
tragedy" was enacted to-day along the
Taitse River.
The Taitse is flooded and cannot be
forded. Â¦ General Oku, in command of
the Japanese left army, has directed
his energies to forcing the Russians to
the river, and it is probable that many
were drowned there.
A private dispatch received here re
ports that grreat . fires are raging at
L'.aoyaijg. This statement is not con
firmed officially. " These' fires are be
lieved to have resulted from the Japa
nese shelling or from the efforts of the
Russians to destroy their stores prepar
atory to the evacuation of Liaoyang,
with the additional hope of injuring the
city as a future Japanese base.
RUSSIAN STRENGTH ESTIMATED.
Unofficial estimates place the Russian
forces in the vicinity of Liaoyang at
fifteen divisions, of 15,000 each. These
probably are excessive, but it is evident
that numerically the Russian forces ex
ceed the Japanese.
The ox>inion that the Russian casual
ti<is in the recent fighting will reach
30.0GO is confidently expressed \ In high
Â¦quarters here. Neither Field Marshal
Oyama nor the Japanese army com
uiandcrF has as yet estimated the Rus

IilHOKI PRESSES THE ATTACK.
The Japanese gained^ a foothold near
Hsinlintun on Wednesday afternoon,
and the telegram says that they occu
pied Hsinlintun and the eminences to
the west of Shoushanpao at 3 o'clock on
Thursday morning, after having deliv
ered a successful night attack, which
t-urprist-d the Russians.
The artillery captured by the Japa

The Daily Graphic says: "We are in
the dark as. to -.the final outcome," add
ing that it seems not unlikely that
Kuropatkin may still manage to .carry
a fighting force with him to Mukden.

The other "critics doubt whether" the
Japanese, in the face of "indomitable
Russian pluck," are strong. enough to
The London daily- newspapers, In
their headlines, depict, the conditions
at Liaoyangas "Russian- route,!' "De
feat," etc. Their editorials, in a; more
careful vein, point 'out that the latest
dispatches leave the issues of the
"greatest battle of this generation" still
in doubt. . Â¦
From the ' expert. British t point of
view, Marquis Gyama's sacrifices will
have been in vain unless he is able to
cut off Kuropatkin from Mukden. On
this point' there are chaotic hypotheses.
.LONDON*, Sept. 3.â English military
authorities neither share Tokio's jubila
tion over the result at Llaoyang nor
lay stress upon th^ advantage which
Russian dispatches attribute to Kuro
petkin's latest move. The best informed
observers, who have access to sources
of information not revealed in the dis
patches from Tokio and not given out
at St. Petersburg, declare that the bat
tle of Liaoyang, however dramatic and
historic In loss of life and tragic inci
dents, can have no serious bearing on
the eventual Issue unless the Japanese
have surrounded Kuropatkin.
. ' "We still : have to learn whether the
Japanese reaped the fruits' of victory in
such abundant measure: as to make the
battle thoroughly decisive-^the turning
point of the war. From the news thus
far available : there: seems to be a
strong probability that -they will -be
able to do so." : .' . -. â¢ .
The Daily Telegraph's military critic,
in common with other English experts,
sees nothing but a superior Japanese
force and strategy to account for Gen
eral Kuropatkin's present position. This
authority predicts an endeavor on the
part of - the. Russian: force to reach
Chinese territory.
FEARS RUSSIANS WILL ESCAPE.
The Standard bluntly voices the
thought of many by asking: "Is it re
treat or rout?" The Standard says tha't
General Kuropatkin, in his "precarious
condition, is not without some pros
pects of avoiding the signal catastrophe
of surrender en masse if he can still get
away to the north. Even with the loss
of many guns and valuable supplies the
success of the Japanese wlll.be a good
deal modified."
The: Times compares the battle of
Llaoyang to those of Wagram, Leip

British Military Authorities Regard Japan's
Jubilation as Premature.
LONDON. Saturday, Sept. 3.â The Times' Tokio cor
respondent, cabling on Friday, says: "The, premature
rumors of the- fall of Liaoyang are repeated to-day, but
a careful "analysis of official reports shows that the Rus
sians have merely been driven into their last line of de
fenses, where they probably will make a desperate re
sistance. Three Japanese armies are closing around
TOKIO, Saturday, Sept. 3 (10:30 a. m.).â It is ex
pected that the main strength of Field Marshal Oyama's
forces to the southward will succeed this morning in
crossing the Taitse River. General Kuroki yesterday
captured a portion of the heights commanding Heiying
tai. and it is hoped that he will dominate the railway
to-day. The Russians appear to be gathering at the Yen-;
tai colliery, northeast of Liaoyang.
At 4 o'clock this afternoon the War
Office received a, dispatch from'Peter
hof,. sent to the 1 Emperor last night
by General Kuropatkin, dated 5
o'clock yesterday afternoon. As com
municated to the press the dispatch
stated that an artillery battle pro
ceeded until 5 o'clock and that the
Russians were retiring ' upon z their
"main positions"; that General Ku
roki was attacking the Russian left,
north of the Taitse River; that the
railroad station, which is situated a
mile northwest of Liaoyang, had been
set on fire by Japanese shells; that
the station had been transferred across
the river to a point on the north
bank; 'that Kuropatkin had passed in
review the Third : Siberian, "Corps un
der General Ivanoff, which suffered
grtatly in the earlier stages of the
battle on the east front; and, finally,
that the Russian losses for two days
were 5000 killed or wounded.
'- The dispatch does not admit that
"General Kuropatkin is v withdrawing
across the. Taitse River' entirely. It
is possible that, owing to the pressure
of the Japanese, the Russian array,
as stated in the Tokio dispatches, was
thrown into confusion and greatly
hampered.

ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 2. â The
feet disclosed for the first time in
these dispatches last night that the
strongest Russian position prepared
by General Kuropatkin was not
around the town of Liaoyang, as the
public had been led to believe, but on
the north banlc of the Taitse River,
was a secret so' successfully guarded
that not even, an intimation of it had
leaked out. It Is now explained that
the Russian commander in chief had
all along expected that the Japanese,
when they made their advance on
Liaoyang. would pursue the identical
tactics which have been so successful
in every previous stage of the cam
paign, end while attracting attention
In front would attempt, .by a wide

General Kuropatkin was not caught
napping. He was prepared for Just
what nas occurred and as soon as he
received . word that General Kuroki
had crossed the. Taitse twenty miles
above Liaoyang and was moving west
ward. Kuropatkin met the move by
throwing his whole army over at
night. By this strategy Kuropatkin,
In the opinion, of the General Staff,
gained an immense advantage. His
army Is concentrated on one side of
the river, and the road is still open
for his retirement, northward, while
the Japanese armies, which must act
In unison, are separated by the river,
which, places Kuropatkin in a posi

army, while Generals Oku and Nodzu
are stranded on the other side. This

STRATEGY OF "SLAV FOX."
" The" report that Rear Admiral Ouk
tomsky, now in command" of the naval
forces at Port Arthur, is to be court
martialed lacks confirmation. The story
probably originated in the same sources
as the earlier report of his " deposition
and of his suicide at Port Arthur.

both sides have already made almost
superhuman efforts,' 1 and" If Is thought
that there must soon -be a let-up of
s'ome sort; - ' -Â¦ â¢ >.'â¢.Â¦
It is pointed out that General Kuroki
will have to make a considerable de
tour to reunite his forces. The bridge
heads abutting on the north bank of
the Taitse River are strongly defended
by intrenched artillery, while it is said
that there ia a strong rear guard still
on the south bank to contest the Japa
nese advance, thus making the bridges
utterly impracticable for a Japanese
crossing. The river itself therefore be
comes an important factor in the gen
eral'scheme of defense. 1 "" ' J
Continued and dogged confidence in
General Kuropatkin is expressed in
many quarters, and the public gener
ally, as well as many of the military
authorities, absolutely refuse to believe
that Llaoyang has been abandoned, or
if it has been abandoned that General
Kuropatkin is not in a better position
to make a stand north of the Taitse
River.
There seemed to be an air of consid
erable confidence at Peterhof last
night. An official who saw the Czar
yesterday afternoon said that he was
extremely confident. Experts who are
familiar with the nature of the intri
cate and powerful defenses constructed
north of the Taitse River by General
Velltchko, one of Russia's foremost army
engineers, believe that the Japanese are
facing an almost impossible task in at
tacking them, especially with divided
forces.

which was given out by the War Office

made public last night, as was expect

A delayed dispatch to the Official
Messenger from Uaoyang, under data
of August 31, gives- some details of the
three days' fighting from August 29.
The correspondent says that. he was
with a battery on Koulack Hill, to
the left of the railway line, at dawn
on Monday, when the Japanese suns
opened fire.
"It was," he continues, "a simul
taneous salute by hundreds of can
nons and during the first hour the
firing was simply terrific. "We wero
under a perfect rain of shrapnel, bul
lets and splinters of sheila. The Jap
anese did not know the country or the
location of our defenses,- so they con
stantly shifted their batteries, trying
to search out our positions.
"It was in the course of these
maneuvers that Koulack had become
an object of interest to the Japanese
artillerymen. The sight was a beauti
ful but terrifying one. Although we
were well masked and tolerably pro
tected, the sides of our hill were rent
and torn by bursting shells; dirt, -dust
and rocks filled the air; sand and
smoke hung like a golden halo over
head. We watched the sheila fall
upon the -ruins of the thousand-year
old watch tower, where they com
pleted the ravages of the centuries. .
"JAPANESE GUNNERS ROUTED.'"
"The Japanese cot our range arfd
tried to^ enfilade us from a village on,
the right. Here we had the advantage
in knowing the range and simply
smothered them with shell3. Conse
quently the Japanese withdrew . hur
riediy. A second attempt to enfilade
us was made at 10 o'clock in the
morning, but again it failed. We
swept the Chinese corn fields whence
the fire came and turned out the Jap
anese gunners like a nest of angry
wasps.. â¢ >.&*

"As to Indiana, I do not care to talk.

of 25,000. I see no reason why we

needed to meet the expenses of army

that the service was embarrassed by
Colonel Clem's action, as it | seriously
interfered with- the work of the quar

General Humphiey has informed
Colonel Clem that his action is disap

duties. The money, having been turned
Into the treasury, is now beyond the

SAN BERNARDINO. Sept. 2. â Bad
marksmanship on the part of Tom
Evans, a. negro, was all that saved the
life of Policeman Kelling Thursday
nighL i Evans had. been drinking and
was yelling in the street when Kell
ing placed him under arrest. Evans
suddenly wrenched himself loose and
drawing a revolver, began firing at
the officer. The first bullet struck
Kelling in the foot, fracturing the
benes of the first, second and third
toes, and causing him to fall to the
ground. Kelling, - while lying on the
sidewalk, returned the fire and Evans
ran off. The fusillade created intense
excitement and Marshal Shay and
other policemen were soon in pursuit
of the negro, who was finally cornered
to an apartment house, after having
been dislodged from a woodyard. His
pistol was empty, but this" did not de
ter him from attempting to bluff off
the Marshal. Evans was taken to the
County Jail, where it was discovered
that he had been shot in the foot.
When his shoe was removed the bul
let dropped out, having entered the
instep and gone through the fleshy

Fairbanks then referred to a visit
he had made in 1S95 to a woolen mill
tn Manchester, England, and to the
tact that he had found the mill ship
ping' large quantities of goods to the
United States. He had said to himself
"There is something wrong about
this." He continued:
Senator Fairbanks did not appear
until the meeting was well under way.
When he arrived he was greeted with
a tremendous burst of applause from
the vast throng present. He said in
part:
TherÂ» la bo one more vitally concerned In
the niilntenar.ee of * protective tariff than

trade can.
It cannot keep wanes at the hiphest level
â¢ !1 the time, but It can keep them there
lc-nser than tree trade can.
This Is tounded on &ood reason. It is an
erdinary. coir.mon-Btnse proposition. Under
free Â¦ trade American workmen have to com
pete not only with themselves, but with the
workmen of all other countries; while under
protection they are not obliged to compete
with workmen in other countries on the same
â¢basis, and they have only to compete with
their fellow- workmen in this country.

LONDON. Sept. 2.â The Italian em
bassy here to-day says that no instruc
tions have been received from Rome re
specting the recovery of the ancient
cope stolen in 1902 from the cathedral
at Askoli, Italy, purchased by J. P!ef[
pont Morgan and now on exhibition- in
the Kensington Museum.
The embassy, nevertheless, is making
inquiries here, but it says the question
of demanding the return of the cope ia
complicated by the fact of Morgan's
citizenship and the presence of the cope
in England. What compensation should
be offered to Morgan is another feature
of the case which ia also embarrassing
the Italian Government. The embassy
suggests if it is Morgan's purpose to
exhibit the cope he should have don*
so as well in Italy as in England or
America.

Although not wishing to detract from the

It does seem a little unfair that the libretto

little of Will Irwln, whose story of the
Hamadryad* opened an avenue to fame for
Mr McCoy. Last year it was Dr. Stewart and

of Amedee Joullin, whese artist mind con

McCoy." especially the "Dance of the Young
Hamadryads," intoxicating, inspiring and bub
bling with the very fullness of youth, called
forth a perfect ovation, as unexpected as It was
deff-rved. Always modest and unassuming. Mr.
McCoy has given little evidence of the fire
of genius that has tnen smoldering and which
the Bohemian Club spirit has at last fanned
Into a brilliant flame. Long may it burn'.

..OAKLAND. Sept. 2.â Cupid is much . like
Russell Sate â or is it Mr. Sasfe that Is, like
Cupid? â In that he does not believe In vaca
tions, and if the weddings â¢ that chase each
other along the calendar are r>roof3 of any
value, his work Is not for naught. The busy
little god a'sks but a "fair field and no favor,"
and Oakland seems to be his favorite camping
ground. Marriages are not nearly so frequent
in San Francisco's smart set, which speaks
well for the fascinations of , the suburban
maid.
A number of notable weddings will; vary
the monotony of September's social calendar,
the most imucrtant. perhaps, on account of
th* prominence of the parties concerned, being
that of Miss May Young and Dr. McNab on
September Â¦Â«;:*. It will be a large arfair. too.
about -UO guests to be wltness-a of thÂ« Inter
esting event.
On September 8 two charming girls will
bei/ome brides. Miss Elva Shay and Miss Alice
Anguk. Both will be home weddings. Miss An
gus, who is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liam Angus, will marry a young business man
of Montreal. Canada, Arthur Louis Brodeur.
and, although the Anguses have a host ot
friends bt-re In the best circies, the wedding
will be very simple and with unly m few
friend? present. Miss Grace Jordan and Walton
Shuhaw will be the only attendants.
The stand for the judges of the water
carnival and the regatta committee has
been erected on Twelfth street, near
the boulevard, and the work of decor
ating the City Hall with electric lights
has been practically completed. This
afternoon workmen commenced to
string the wire's across Broadway and
Washington street for the street decor
ations. The work of draping bunting
on the City II -.11 Will be commenced to
morrow. â¢ Â¦
The secretary of the committee was
notified to-day that Company I, X. G.
C. of Livermore would be unable to
take part\n the parade as almost all
the members would turn out with Las
Positas Parlor of which they are also
members.*
Arrangements for the State celebra
tion are now nearly completed and but
little more remains for the committee
to attend to. The members of Stock
ton Parlor No. S7 will visit Oakland
one hundred and twenty-five strong
and -will appear in the parade in uni
form, headed by a brass band.
El Dorado Parlor No. 52 of San Fran

Baldwin said his wife left home yes
terday morning. He saw nothing more
of her until he was summoned to the
Morgue. â¢ ":V-"V-
The train men believe that the
woman hid behind two large bridge
timbers and jumped in front of the en
gine just as it was opposite her place
of concealment. -'-'*-Â»
Engineer Baldwin runs on the same
line where his wife was killed. He has
an opposite run to-, that of Engineer
Lorensen. The couple resided at 840
Alice street. Mrs. Baldwin was about
40 years old. She was a daughter of
J. D. Plitt, formerly proprietor of the
Plittsville hotel. She was a sister of
Mrs. Joseph Dieves.
According to her husband, who had
been apprised of his wife's death by the
Morgue officials, who had the body
identified, Mrs. Baldwin had been suf
fering for a long time from frequent
spells of melancholia. Of late the at
tacks had been so, numerous that the
woman's mind seemed to have been
affected.
* *
OAKLAND, Sept. 2. âThat Mrs.
Emma Baldwin, wife of E. L,. Baldwin,
a Sc-uthern Pacific Company locomo
tive engineer, i committed suicide by
throwing herself in front of a local
train on Alice street bridge last night
is suspected by her husband. The
woman's body was recovered from the
harbor near the Alameda approach to
the bridge this morning by Fred
Thompson, first officer c-f the steamer
Empire," moored near the bridge.
The only marks of violence were
about the woman's head, where she
had evidentiy been struck by the loco
motive pilot. The skull was crushed
and showed that the blow had prob
ably caused instant death. An autopsy
disclosed no water on the lungs, prov
ing that Mrs. Baldwin was dead when
her body fell into the. bay. " t '.
On the 11 o'clock trip of the Webster
street train last night. Engineer Toby
Lorensen thought he saw a white obr
Ject on the bridge as the engine neared
the Alameda end of the draw. Loren
sen felt satisfied that a human being
had" been struck. He stopped to see
what had occur--- 1 and was further
convinced when, under the glare of. his
engine lamps he saw splotches of Mood
and a fluttering bit of woman's gar
ment on the pilot.
Search was made over the bridge
and around the tracks, but not a sign
of a body was discovered. It was not
until daybreak and the finding of Mrs.
Baldwin's body that the engineer's sus
picions were verified.
Why Mrs. Baldwin should have been
wandering about the Alice street bridge
late at night was a mystery. It is only
a railroad bridge, there being neither
wagon nor pedestrian roadway on the
structure:
The association is hopeful that this
work will be pressed rapidly now that
the total fund is in excellent shape.
There are m2ny preliminary details to
be settled, but the building committee
has them in hand and is making prog
ress. * â¢
The directors have requested Mr.
Kling to delay his departure for a
month that they may have ample time
in which to canvass the field for the
selection of his successor. The post
will be peculiarly onerous because of
the work ahead of building and in
stalling the association in its new
home.
William A. Kling, secretary of the
Young Men's Christian Association,
will soon retire to accept one of sev
eral offers of like positions that have
.come to him from important associa
tion centers in Eastern cities.
The successful canvass to raise
$200,000 for the construction of a new
Y. M. C. A. building in Oakland was
conducted under Mr. Klines direction-
He came to Oakland on invitation of
the board of directors to take special
charge of that work. It is practically
completed and. in view of the tenders
from the East, Secretary Kling feels
that his term of service in the local
association can be ended without in
terfering with the new plans of the
organization.

. "You must pay to h^Ip support her
at the rate of $4 50 a week and $20
for her attorney. After the triai of
the casÂ« this may be changed, but if
you fail to pav her this amount severe
measures will be taken to se*Â» that you
fulfill your part of the obligation."
For having deserted the wife who
had married when he was earning
only Jl a day. Walter Clausen was
lectured by Judge Offden to-day and
ordered to pay his wife 14 50 a week
for her support, as his wages were
lately raised to $2 a day. This sum
must be paid until the divorce pro
ceedings now pending are finally dis
posed *bf.
Clausen is a plasterer's apprentice
and when he married was earning $1
a day. After a yÂ»ar of married life
&nd when his pay had been increased
to $2 a day he tired of marital bonds
and deserted his home. Judge Ogden
pointed out to him the bravery of the
unman who had married him upon
such a pittance and the fact that he
owed her allegiance. "During the
most trying part of your married life,
when you had the least to live on.
jour wife stayed by you and when
you got a raise you Â¦ left her. As
things became easier you should have
done everything but leave her, and
your excuse that the amount you
make is not enough to support two
people comes at too late a day," said
thÂ«. Judge.

noon. At the close of the show a
complete list of prize winners will be

were present to address the second
university meeting of the new term.
The speakers were Professor William
A. Setchell. head of the department of
botany, and the Rev. William Herman
Hopkins, the newly elected pastor of
the First Congregational Church.
Professor Setchell appeared before
the students for the first time since
his return from a trip around the
world, observing and studying the
methods in vogue in the botanical
gardens of all countries. Professor
Setchell devoted himself largely to a
description of student life in the great
universities and the difference be
tween the methods followed there and
in America. In Oxford and Heidel
berg he found that the students have
entirely different ways of manifesting
their university spirit from those in
America.

Hanley said he had not insulted the
woman, that he knew her and meet
ing her on the street he had spoken
to her, as he thought was his priv

she called to Arrott, claiming she had

escape in a cab during the street bat
tie.
They were arrested on the street
while fighting like bulldogs and both
showed the marks in court. Broker
Arrott claimed that Hanley had in

walking, that she appealed to him
and then he attacked Mr. Hanley.

both well known and wealthy.

It then remains for the mother to use her influence, not by direct thwart
ing. If it is necessary to check a girl's course it is better to influence them
gradually than to give a direct refusal, as the latter breeds discontent. It is
better even for a girl to make a trial of her ambitious desires if possible
and learn for herself the accompanying disillusionments and trials.
But if the girl has'the appearance of genius do not spoil her with flattery.
Show her that it is not in the quantity of talent or influence, but in the faith
fubappropriatlon of each that merit consists; but that the moment she be
comes satisfied in using either for mere personal advantage she has taken a
step toward becoming weak.'
Teach her that. a woman's lot in life is, indeed, an important one. Do not
let her regret that she is a woman. There are many new spheres now open
to woman if she chooses to make a career, and. besides this, if she cannot
make a name for herself let her realise the fact that a woman is the instiga
tor, the most powerful Influence on man. Nearly every distinguished man
acknowledges that his deepest obligations are due to a wife, a mother or a
slEter who hap aroused, encouraged or assisted him in his lifework.
Look, for instance, at all the gVeat masterpieces in poetry and literature,
at heroic deeds and noble sacrifices; in nearly every case a woman was the
incentive.
If a girl's ambitions trend toward a scientific education. by % all means en
courage her and discover whether she really is conscientious and thorough in
her pursuits. A man's chief argument against the higher education of wom
en is that a Woman is apt to dabble In such matters, but rarely gives any
study a thorough investigation; that, in fact, a woman's knowledge is gener
ally superficial.
'jl.â. 'Â¦ â - â i â ; :
Then is the time to discover her natural bent. She must have some study
in which she excels, or perhaps her tastes are artistic or domestic. If she is
of romantic temperament she will probably wish to go on the stage or to be
a concert singer. Or it may be her thoughts He in a college course.
THERE are few young girls who at a certain period of their lives do not
have ambitions to. become great and famous. The influence ofthe school,
of associates or perhaps the .example of some favorite heroine, or even
a person in real lifeâ any one or all^ of these' influences are sufficient to
awaken a kindred enthusiasm in the heart of an imaginative girl, says the
Philadelphia Ledger.
This is the time that must be carefully prepared for. by the mother. If sh2
has the complete confidence of her daughter and understands the workings
of her mind there is nothing to fear, for the mother realizes and can there
fore appreciate the awakening impulses of budding womanhood and can
lead them into the right directions.
This ambitious period generally comes during the last years of school
life, before a girl has actually entered the world, when her heart is un
touched save by her love for the home circle and a few intimate friends.

SYMPATHY.
While the worship of the Sierra for
ests is all well enough, they are of far
too gfeat commercial value to serve no
other ends and should, as President
Roosevelt so wisely said, be perpetuated
â¢â¢by wise use." What* the State wants
Is not forests which are "beautiful
parks," but productive stands of tim
ber trees and it is essential in such a
forest that the despised undergrowth
exist, for therein lies the potential fre
estâthe young trees of future timber
value.
What is needed instead <of a return
to primitive Indian methods is a more
rational public sentiment regarding
forest values and uses. Our dear
friends, the intelligent public, go Into
the forests annually by thousands and
with their campflres, cigarette stumps
and matches do' everything in their
power to destroy one of the State's
greatest assets. They know better
than to play with fire tn town and why
should they not use a little care -while
In the forests?
The State Is to have new fire laws
and a system of fire protection, but
its success depends on revision of pub
lic sentiment toward this greatest of
forest evils. * E. A. STERLING.
San Francisco, August 31, 1904.
The system of fire protection which
he recommends is to follow the old In
dian practice and burn over the floor
at the forest each year. Some of the
results of such a system would be as
follows: All young growth up to the
diameter of two inches would he seri
ously injured or killed and all possi
bility of a future forest destroyed; the
mature trees would be injured through
burning out at the bases, the repeated
fires burning off a percentage of them
each year and gradually reducing" the
density of the original stand; undesir
able brush would usurp open spots,
through Its tendency to sprout after
fire, while coniferous young growth Is
killed outright; while by the burning
of the humus and vegetable ground
cover and exposure of the mineral soil
the water conserving power of the for
est would be in a great measure lost
and the soil impoverished.
Such burning, besides being Injurious.
is furthermore unnecessary, because
the accumulations of twigs, needle*,
etc., reach only a certain depth, the
bc"'ance being maintained by the de
composition underneath.
Systematic burning of the slash left
after lumbering is most decidedly ad
vantageous and practical experiments
are under way to show lumbermen that
it can be done economically, but firing
of the uncut "forest, or' after the
slash clearing fire, should never be
thought of.
While Mr. Ostrander i3 In a large
measure correct in saying that with
the prevention of forest flres the whole
problem of forestry will be solved, he
has missed some of the most vital
points in this connection and made
suggestions which, if fallowed, would
result in the ultimate destruction of
the forest as a productive commercial
factor.
Editor The CallâIn your issue of
August 31 you published a letter from
H. J. Ostrander of Merced, comment
ing on the work of the United States

In these days a State is known by its press. It has been an old joke
confusing to people of short stature to tell them *o stand on a newspaper
so they can be seen. When the advice is applied to a State it has a
deep significance. States elevate themselves into notice by standing on
tbe newspapers which raise them to the altitude of the world's notice.
Thi> has made that part of California represented by our visitors, and it
will raise the whole State to a height so great that the gilding of the
ryr.set will glow upon it until it fades into the purple of the morning, and
there shall be no night, nor darkness upon any part of California, as seen
in the mirror oi the press.
The visiting editors see us as we are; they will be in touch with
the hospitality we offer to thousands of visitors from afar. They will
understand the spirit behind it all. In these days the honor and reputation
;>f the State are in our hands, and if they suffer the State is shamed. No
one shall blush for California, and our Southern friends being in part bene
f.ciarie* of what we do in this pageant and gala time, will keenly appreciate
ric spirit in which we stand for all Californa, that all of our distant visitors
tazy go home carrying in their minds an indelible vision of the State, where,
the. mines of Ophir. the gardens of Hesperidcs, the, mountains of exaltation
and plains richer than the valley of the Nile combine . their invitation
to;" men to come and partake of the cornucopia, .which nature has filled
with ail that is good for man and conducive to his enjoyment. Â«
- It is well that in this vast State we of its far extremities should oftener
ir.ret and better know each other. We are not rivals. We are joint owners
of the richest physical heritage on the planet. Between us there i% only
one sort of competition, and that is in so spreading abroad a conception
of what is here that thousands, hearing the news and seeing the sign, will
come, cat the lotus, forget' what is behind them and determine that all their
future shall be upon the sunlit and flower-bordered paths of California.
rT> HE excursion of the editors of Southern California to the St. Louis
E*po*ilion will tarry in San Francisco to-day en route. Perhaps
so me 6f them have never seen Northern California and the metropolis
Wore, but whether they have or not. they arc royally welcome as repre
vcr.tWves of the push and enterprise which have made their part of the
Strue the best known section of the modern world. They will see the
city and the seashore and Mount Tamalpais, and more's the pity their
I.ricf tojourn forbid* that they see the orchards and viiieyards, the olive
[flintations, the wide-spreading orange groves . and the fields and gardens,
which prove the equal heirship of nature's gifts from one end of the
State to the oilier. * -
A New England statesman and economist once said: "If New England
could grow the cotton plant she would rule the Union and, therefore, the
civilized world" So it may be truthfully said that if Northern .California
had ihe .enterprise and the advertising faculty which are second nature to
our welcome visitors, this part of the State would easily defy the com
petition of the whole world. They have looked out upon the dry and
desert wastes of Southern California, where a genial sun shone with zesty
beam* upon b.-.rreu lands and by their genius and faculty have transformed
a forbidding l=::d:-capc into groves and gardens that charm the visitor as
Ulysses was enchanted by ihe gardens, of. Calypso.
No achievement has been loo formidable for them, and while others
miy have rt?;Â»ed thÂ«- enterprise they sowed, the credit is theirs everlastingly.
Every ccTHmtmUy, rural or urban, in this country must thank one source
for its acvr.rccir.cnt and prosperity. That source is the press. The time
has xonz by wLen Ihe qualities of a country, or the news of the day, can
be osefaiJy Transmitted by tradition or conversation. Those methods are
too slow. Before their effect can be felt the generation that could take
advantage o: sudi transmission of news and facts will be gathered ro its
?aiiicr*.. la il:is modern world the press is the ready and speedy transmitter,
red 'every editor, by the power of publicity, is a modern Jupiter, giving
orders and information by the sudden thunderbolt and not by ox team.
A'.I California may learn from these Southern editors and they may
learn much while they arc with us. They may sec a vastly broader field
upon which may be wrought the same change that they have willed upon
Southern California. They will see here the same climate, physical con
ditions, ranjre of products and a greater opportunity for achieving that
which they compelled in their section of the State. They will be present
with u> a brief time. When they go may they leave upon us the baptism
of that splendid spirit which has wrought miracles and worked wonders

NEW YORK, Sept. 2.â Dun's Weekly
Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Confidence increases each week as a
larger proportion of the agricultural
yield is placed beyond the reach of in
jury and Industrial undertakings are
less Interrupted by labor controversies.
It is not to be expected that the busi
ness world will suddenly abandon its
conservative attitude, purchases being
still restricted largely to such needs as
are clearly discerned, but there is evi
dence of a growing disposition to pro
vide for more remote requirements. In
many lines, particularly dry goods,
stocks have been reduced more below
normal and fall shipments are expand
ing In a healthy manner.
Distribution of merchandise is pro
viding the railways with a large ton
nage, preparations are being made to
handle the enormous crops and the
gross earnings of all railways reporting
for three weeks In August show a gain
of 1.4 per cent over the same time last
year. Foreign commerce for the last
week at this port was smaller than a
year ago, exports decreasing $307,277,
while imports fell 5&04.902, and this ten
dency is largely responsible for the
treasury delict In August, customs re
ceipts falling about $3,000,000 behind
those of the same month Jast year.
Quiet conditions have prevailed in the
hide markets.
The failures this week In the United
States were 222, against 205 last week,
226 the preceding week and 181 the cor
responding week of last year. The fail r
ures In Canada number 25, against 23
last week, 24 the preceding week and
7 last year. j

NEW YORK; Sept. 2. â Bradstreet's
to-morrow will say:
Further expansion of fall trade is
noted at leading centers and the last
week in August has seen the largest
business done since the opening of the
season. Crops have, made fair prog
ress. Collections have been nothing
to boast of and have been backward,
in fact.' Failures were more numer
ous than in July in nearly all sections.
Suspensions of -mercantile concerns
.have swollen liabilities beyond those
of August a year ago. Recently pre
ceding conditions are maintained In
railroad earnings, which show slight
saing over the last year.
The Industrial outlook is still an un
settled one. Efforts to revive the meat
strike by extending it to independent
houses have caused some irregularity
and uncertainty in the market for
livestock and for meats. General
price reductions of live animals' are a
feature. The industrial outlook . at
New York Is unsettled because of the
drifting apart of employers and em
ployes In the building trades and the
prospects of a strike of motormen in
the new subway. Some more resump
tions of Industrial operations are not
ed in different sections. The general
tone of labor affairs is one of Irrita
tion. On the Pacific Coast distribu
tive trade is still slow to Improve.
Wool is firm at Eastern centers,
with a fair business being done on a
feeling that the available stoks will
bring full prices. A tendency toward
higher prices of many staples was not
ed this week. Poor reports from the
harvest in the Northwest strength
ened wheat and, sympathetically, flour
and the feeling received support that
the crop damage in the Northwest had
not been exaggerated.
Tin and lead have advanced slight
ly, while copper has remained un
changed. The very heavy export
movement in this latter product has
been a feature of the country's for
eign trade this year. .

I Some time ago The Call published a
| review of the ' reports made by
the United States Geological Sur
vey relative to the tin depos
its of the York region, In Alaska. The
! commercial and economic bearing of
; the existence of tin in large quantities
in any portion of the territory of the
; United States is readily appreciated.
In a series of articles in the Mining
and Scientific -Press A. J. Collier im
parts supplementary information that
is Interesting.. Collier avers that the
main tin-bearing ledge on Tin Creek
can be traced a mHe from Tin Creek
westward across a mountain. Crosscut
trenches have been made on the ledge
near Cassiterite Creek, and these
showed that the, ledge Is about 100 feet
wide. At Cape â¢ Mountain, from x which
points on the' Asiatic coast are visible
on a clear day, Is the settlement known
as Tin City. Specimens of tin ores
have been found on the surface at Tin
City. These undoubtedly came from
higher up the mountain and from its
surface, but the ore has not been ded- j
nltely traced to its place of original lo
cation. Tin ore has been found, so Col
lier reports, in three distinct places on
Cape Mountain. Several short tunnels
have been driven into the mountain,
but have not reached ore bodies. The
granite of some of these tunnel3 is
partly altered to gneiss, and this fact
is taken as justification of the belief
thatore bodies may not be far distant.
Of the country Collier writes:
IN THE YORK REGION. \
Three roads are In construction to the
Masonic Mountain , mining district, in
Mono Countyâ from , Bodie, from
Bridgeport and from Sweetwater.

MINES OP CALIFORNIA.
To carry out this pumping work, it is
agreed by the Truckee River General
Electric Company that a new plant,
distinct from the one now existing at
Floriston, shall be constructed two
miles distant from the older plant, and
that a separate pole line shall also be
put in so that either or both power
plants and connections may be used
on the Comstock as the emergency
warrants. If one plant gives out tem
porarily the other will be ready for
immediate use. The mining companies
agree to use $2500 worth of power a
month for the. period of. five years for
the Gold Hill properties and ten years
for the middle arid "north end groups.
All that was needed' to close the deal
was the approval by directors of the
mining companies. The contract was
ratified by the directors of the Ophii,
Consolidated California and Virginia,
Mexican, Union Consolidated and Si
erra Nevada companies. The remaining
companies will soon give their ap
proval. The companies that are con
cerned are the Utah, Sierra Nevada,

A rumor was on the street yesterday
afternoon that some local man had
cleaned up $60,000 in the Goldfleld
mines, but no names were mentioned,
although there were brokers In the
stock board who were reported to know
the facts. When they were questioned
they would not -stand as sponsors for
the story. One report was that "Lucky"
J&kin Jones, who with "Shorty" Ken
dall nnd JL. L. Patrick, found a rich
ledge only eighteen inches under the
surface at Goldfield, was once more
lucky. If he is tht^man he has man
aged to keep still "about It.
Two events of yesterday served to
stir up the Interest of the mining com
munity and to direct attention to Ne
vada. Early in the day a dispatch was
received by George S. Nixon, candidate
for the United States Senatorship in Ne
vada, in which he was informed that
he was richer to the extent of $100,000
by reason of the rich ore that had been
discovered in a mine In the new camp
of Goldfteld. The ore was reported to
be worth $2000 to the ton. Nixon was
not surprised. He believes that Gold
rleld ore is the richest in the w.orld. '
While this information was buzzed
about among miners, a contract was
closed, under the terms of which thirty
one mining companies, composing the
Comstock" Pumping Association, will
pay : for' additional electric power from
the Truckee River General - Electric
Company that the drainage and deep
exploitation of the Comstock lode may
be effected.
Cajsiterlte, in the form of etream tin. Is dis
tributed from the mouth of the creek to within
one mile of its head, above which point little
more than traces have been found. The ore
varies In size from sand to pebbles weighing
thirteen or fourteen pounds. Several pieces
from five to eight pounds in weight were seen,
though the averaze size is much smaller. A
few of tho pebbles are perfectly rounded, but
most of them arc subanxular. The ore from
the claims near thÂ« mouth of Buck Creek
I* generally well rounded, while that from near
the head is sharp and angular. In general
the stream tin grows more angular as the issod
of tfÂ« creek is approached.
Â¦ TtuÂ» color of the casslterite varleÂ» from al
most black to a llaht resin or amber; when
crusbÂ».3, however, it makes a light-colored
resinous powder, by which it is readily -dis
tinguished from hematite or other iron miner
als that are frequently mistaken for it, slnca
they invariably rive a distinctly red, brown
or black oowder. Sometimes small pieces of
cassiterite are found inclosed between frag
ments of slate, showing that the ore some
times occurs as veinlets in the bedrock.
It has been stated that the gravels contain
about elrht pounds of eo per cent ore to the
cubic yard. The value per yard on this basis,
with tin at 28 cents per pound, would be $1 34,
but of which charges for shipping and treat
ment would have to be paid.
The pay streak appears to be confined to
the present stream-bed and Rood-plain deposits.
In the present creek bed the ore is found from
the surface to the bottom of the gravels.
Outside the creek bed. in the flood plain, there
is a covering of moss and muck above the
pay 'gravel. No cassiterite is known to have
been found on the hillsides surroundintr Burk
Creek or on the plateau surface in which Buck
Creek Valley Is Incised, though such an oc
currence Is to be expected. The known pay
streak varies in width from ten to one hundred
and flfty feet, and in thickness from a few
inehÂ»s to five feet. Estimates of the amount
of tin ore in the gravels vary from eight -to
twenty -seven pounds per cubic yard.
Buck Creek is a small stream about five
miles in length. It receives a large tributary
known ss Slitter Creek one mile . from it*
mouth. ' About four mll-es from its mouth it
again- forks and has two branches, the risht
and left forks. Near the mouth of Buck
Creek. 'Â¦ boulders and pebbles of â¢ green stone
occur in the cravtl deposits. Theas havÂ« not
been traced to. their source, but they probably
came froma eroun of hills on the east side
of Grouse Creek before the present drainaga
Â¦wns established. At a number of places along
B'.ick Creek small quartz veins were found
cutting across the beddin? or running parallel
with it through the slate. Soms of these quartz
veins are ns much as three or four feet thick.
ThÂ« crave! deposits in the bed cf Buck Creek
are from ten to ons hundred and fifty feet
wide, varying greatly in different parts of the
cr*ek. ,
importance the Diomede Islands may
merit investigation. There should be
tin at Brooks Mountain, eleven miles
north of the mouth of Lost River, and
also on the Bon River. Discoveries of
tin at Ear Mountain are reported. Buck
Creek, on the Arctic slope of the Sew
a'rd peninsula, was the scene of the first
actualmining of tin ore in Alaska, and
this remains the center for tin placer
mining activity. Buck Creek is about
twenty miles northeast ; of York and
four miles from tide water on the Lopp
lagoon, a body of water not navigable
for sea vessels and affording no harbor
for such craft. Of the Buck Creek de
velopments Collier says: . .. .,

From appearances the Oakland band
is in. The talent is there,, but the
spirit is lacking. They ' cant win a
game any more. Some thought their
recent winning streak in the north
boded wcllfor a climb to a top-notch
position, but it was not to be. As
soon as they came home it was the
same old story, in the same old way.
When Buchanan twirls they generally
win, but "with another pitcher in the
box the odds are always against them
and they generally lose.
' On paper Oakland has as good a ball
team, as- any in the league, but dope
does- not seem to count for much. Ever
since Lohman was forced to seek the
bench it has been off with the Cora
muters.. This demonstrates that the
venerable . Peter cannot make his
charges play ball unless he is in the
midst of the. fight himself. .
â¢The drafting process will in all prob
ability play havoc with the talent in
the Pacific Coast League this season.
The ever .'alert magnates in the big
leagues have their glimmers already
set on many a promising youngster,
and, of course, .the Pacific Coast
League will have no redress when the
big: fellows are ready to .act. Then
t her coast people will find * that the
national agreement can. do more harm
than good , in this . Far Western terri
tory.' -
How "Keg" Dugdale manages to
keep apace with that mottled ball
team of his is a problem that would
worry any baseball fan. Still the
Brownies are winning their share of the
games at the present time and making
some of the star aggregations worry a
whole lot when they hook up. There
is no head to the outfit, no team work
and nobody can notice any visible gin
ger when they are engaged in strife.
Still they get away with a goodly por
tion of their games.
'According to 1 the .present . plans, the
northerners and' southerners will start
together â¢" from Â¦ San ; Francisco on
.Wednesday,, the '21i.t' Inst., and journey
south. The. first .control will be Sa
linas; the second San- Luis Obispo, and
the third -Santa .Barbara. , On the 21th
the"' motorists ' will - reach Los â¢ Angeles.

.The most brilliant: performer at the
recent races at . Del Llorite ; was : George
P.' Fuller, who won the Del Monte cup
and" several; other trophies and was
Belected'.as the -representative' of the
Automobile- Club of California In the"
contest 1 .for, ' the interclub "perpetual
'challenge cup presented by L. P. Lowe."
Though ; Mr. -Fullef is an ; amateur, cvvho

rounding ; the '/corners or the : track '. at

The plan at -first arranged was for
the San â¢ Francisco automobilists to
Journey -In their motor cars to Los An
geles and, after a two d.-.ys' rest there,
to journey back in company with the
southern motorists, wno," after a two
days' stop In San Fs^hclsco, were to
make the. return, trip, to Los Angeles.
This arrangement would have made a
round trip of about a thousamd miles
for the motor -cars.' ' It Is thought,
however, that the 500-mile trip in one
direction will be a sufficient test of the
endurance of the cars and, incidentally,
of their 'drivers." ;â¢ , Â¦ \,
Now that the annual meet and races
of the Automobile Club of California
at Del Monte are over. L. P. Lowe, the
indefatigable chairman, of the club, has
turned his attention once i..ore to the
proposed joint endurance run of the
Automobile dubs, of and of
Southern ' California.
The victory of the Alameda cricket
eleven in ' last Sunday's match against

though" McNaughton and Baugh ; were

The match set down for to-morrow

Though the new centerboard sloop
Corinthian defeated the fin-keel sloop
Challenger In the recent race for the
Perpetual Challenge Cup, there are
many yachtsmen who think the Chal
lenger the better boat. The conditions
of the weather on the day of the race
were especially suited to the shallow,
beamy boat and many yachtsmen be
lieve tha with a strong breeke and in
a heavy sea the Challenger would turn
the tables on the Corinthian. It is
practically certain that the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club will challenge for
the trophy next year, naming -the
Challenger as its representative. It. Is
not, however,- by any means certain
the Corinthian will be chosen as; the
defender.* Though the Corinthian ac
complished the purpose ; for which , she
was built, it is pretty well known that
she has disappointed her builders and
owners.
The regatta Is expected to prove un
usually Interesting and to provide
good racing in all the classes. In the
20-foot class the sloops Vixen and Zada
and the yawl Kittiwake will make an
interesting race. In the 25-foot class
the sloops Ruby, Discovery and Xeva
will have a royal battle for first prize.
The contest Is always close among the
yachts of the 30yfoot class, though W.
G. Morrow's sloop Challenger is sure
of first place. In the 36-foot class the
speedy Harpoon will fight it out with
F. Stone's enlarged and Improved
Presto; while in the 44-foot class the
slcops Xixle and Speedwell will con
tend for first place. F. G. Berry has
fitted the Xlxie with a new suit of
sails and Commodore Jennings will
have the Speedwell in the best of
trim.
will be divided into the usual classes.
The entry list will close at 8 p. m. on
Tuesday, the 6th inst.. at the Mer
chants' Exchange, where the delegates
of the association will hold a meeting
for the purpose of making the final
arrangements. â¢Â»

Mike Fisher complains that the East
ern magnates have drafted his dog.
Mike values the canine highly and says
no mention was made of him in the
national agreement, but still he has
been taken away. It looks as if the
big leaguers would go right through
Mike's Tigers, for if they begin with
the dog. they will surely go further.

it generally means a run. At that he
fields perfectly. It la In throwing to
first that the new shortstop gets him
self into trouble. Last week he lost a
couple of games In this manner and
they were close ones. If Gochnauer had
Buck Francks* wing he would surely
be a wonder. As It Is he will have to
show the fans here that he can surpass
Francks as a fielder.
To the casual observer flycaitlng looks sim
ple. The grace with which tha club member*
display their ability to place their fly at wlil
is marvelous, still they accomplish this tea:
without aDparmt difficulty. This Is the re
sult of close application and long continued
practice. It takes years to become proficient.
To be able to gauge distances and to manipu
late the -reel in lure casting, as has been
demonstrated by C. R. Kannlff. the world*
champion, shows what caa be done by prac
tice.
James Watt, who Is an enthusias
tic angler, pays the following tributa
to the club and to the pastime of fly
casting:
The ancler ambitious to teeonw aa expert
in fiycasting would do well to avail hlxnselJ
of the advantage* to bÂ« derived from an oc
casional visit to Stow Lake, when contests
are twins held by the members of the San
Francisco Flycasting Club, it la Interesting
to see what can be accomplished by the Mem
bers of this world famous club, who devot*
their leisure hours to the healthful paatiroÂ»
of flycastlnff. We read In European â¢porting
Journals of flycastlnc contests which do not
compare with what our California angler*
can do. Where will you. tod aaotlxer Maas
fleld. a Kennlff. a Golcher or a Brotherton?
These gentlemen have, by their own persist
ency, mastered the intricacies, which beset t^a
anglers who have for the paat few years
made Stow Lake their headquarters for their
casting evenia. The weather conditions ar*
so varied and never to be relied uoon that
great credit Is due ths flycaaters who havÂ«
reached the pinnae!* of fame as the cham
pion flycasters of the world.
The membership of the San Fran
cisco Flycasting Club are enthusiastic
over the clubhouse which has been
erected on the edge of Stow Lake for
their convenience. Although unpre
tentious in size it Is artistic and adds
much to the adornment of the park.

This Is members' night at the quar
ters of the San Francisco Yacht Club
in Sausalito. A billiard and a card
tournament will be held. To-morrow
a cruise outside the Heads will be
taken, the tide serving: favorably. The
tide runs out at Fort Point from 7:22 a.
m. to-morrow till 12:10 p. m., and floods
until 6:15 p. m., making it easy for the
boats to get home to their moorings.
At noon to-day the flagship Speed
well of the Corinthian Yacht Club will
start on a trip to the southern waters
of the bay, where the visitors will be
entertained to-morrow by the members
of the South Bay Yacht Club. Curtis
Barker and Edward Maynard of San
Jose will pilot the Corinthians. The
flagship will be accompanied by the
sloops Edna, Aeolus, Neptune, Espey,
Fleetwing and Genesta. To-morrow
will be spent at the Alviso clubhouse,
where there will be a barbecue and
clambake. Several gasoline launches
are included in the fleet of the South
Bay Yacht Club and these will be em
ployed taking the visitors around the
southern bay.
The fleet of the California Yacht
Club will cruise to Petaluma Creek
during the holidays.

When the champion came up from the
Fouth In the spring she was considerably
lighter tssn at the end of her campaign last
fall and this v.-Â«s not regarded as an aus
picious omen. Her subsequent collapse was
not unexpected by some who had observed
the mare In her trials and tnese men are not
Inclined to think she will break any records
In J004.
To aay that Lou Dillon is rull of life would
bÂ» but elating the facts, Â»ut although she
Is active as a cat and anxious to go at speed
time. It is the impression among horsemen
that she will hardly accomplish the record
Â»>r*>akinr Teat* that had been laid out for
her early in the year. The truth is that -at
:iii time before she was taken down sick was
lÂ»u Dillon right on edge in the way of speed
and general condition, with, perhapx, the ex
cor-tion of one day when she s was booked to
so to a wagon at a Cleveland matinee. She
t-terped a mde in 2:04 % that day and acted
like her old nelf. but it was the solitary occa
rion when she seemed up to much.
Aa a matter of fact the condition of the
champion trotter was never serious, her
trouble being practically a nervouÂ» collapte.
After the fever that alarmed the mare's at
tendants had been ruhd uÂ«d by the veterinary
the little trotter was led around for a few
days and after considerable exercise of this
sort -Doc" Tanner, trainer of the Billing*
l;orÂ«es and who bad personal charge of Lou
Plllon during the absence of Miliard Banders
at the Eastern races, began leading Lou
Â¦round behind a cart whicn was hauled a
f^ven mile an hour gait by a steady goin-
I rotter. It was not until Sanders returned to
Cleveland that Fhe was harnessed and given
her jogging Jn the erdlnary way.
An Eastern horse expert, who recent
ly inspected Lou Dillon, the champion
trotter, says:
I saw Leu Dillon at the Cleveland track
the other day taking her rim work In har
ness eince the sickness that came upon her
suddenly last month.
It is well for breeders who expect to
get good prices for their trotters to re
member that speed alone will not bring
big money. Manners are everything
In a trotter and that is one of the
principal reasons of Sweet Marie's suc
cess on the Grand Circuit this year.
No matter how long nor how tedious
the scoring becomes she never frets,
but is always ready to get away at full
speed cr stop to a Jog If asked to. She
has won more than $20,000 to date and
has hardly lifted her nose in any heat.
She is an unbeaten mare and the fast
est trotter yet sired by McKinney.
Sweet Marie is owned by William Gar

paigned by Robert Smith of Philadel
phia. Her dam Is Lady Rivers by
Carr's Mambrino 1789, her second dam

by Highlander, her fourth dam by
Owen Dale, son of Williamson's Bel
mont, and her fifth dam by Black
Hawk Comet. She was bred by Frank
G. Schumacher of Los Angeles and
purchased by M. M. Potter, who sold
her with his other horses when he left
Los Aneeles to assume the manage
ment of the Hotel Potter at Santa Bar
bara. In his catalogue statement. Mr.
Potter said he expected her to prove
"the fastest trotter McKinney has yet
tired" and his expectation have been
realized. At the sale Mr. Garland paid
$3150 for Sweet Marie and could prob
ably get $20,000 for her now were he
Â¦willing to sell. She has earned about
that sum in races this year.
Utah's State Fair will open on Oc
tc-bcr 4. About $12,000 has been hung
up for trotters and pacers. J. S. Brans
ford, supervisor of racing at the fair,
has been at Sacramento this week of
fering California horse owners induce
ments to visit Utah and race at the
meeting. It is said that about two
carloads of California horses have been
secured by him.
The Pacific Coast Trotting Horse
Breeders' Association has decided to
increase the guaranteed value of its
Futurity stake to $7000. which is $1000
more than it has heretofore been. This
Ftake had more than four hundred en
tries last year and gives promise of
receiving more than five hundred on
October 15. when entries close. It was
Inaugurated in 1900 and since that time
has developed a three-year-old trotter
that has a record of 2:14, a two-year
old trotter with a record of 2:20,
a three-year-old pacer with a record of
2:13?i and a two-year-old pacer with a
mark of 2:16 1 / *.
Irish, a pacer by the California sire.
Monterey (2:09^), took a pacing record
of 2:0&*i at Decatur, Illinois, last week,
the fastest time made by a four-year
old this year.
Several carloads of California trotters
and pacers will leave Sacramento next
Monday for Salem, Oregon, where the
Oregon State Fair opens on the 12th
inst. Xear!y all the best harness horses
;hat have appeared on the California
circuit are entered throughout the
North Pacific Circuit.
Aristo. 2:0SlÂ», the handsome big trot
ter bred by Alex Brown of Walnut
Grove, California, Is referred to by an
Eastern turf writer as an iron horse,
as he has been started as many as
three times a week and been a money
â¢winner every time. His record was
made in a dead heat with Sweet Marie
and but for an ailing leg he would
doubtless get a much lower record.
Ten 2:10 trotters is the contribution
of California to the list of fast trotters
on the Grand Circuit this year. This
is a record never before equaled nor
approached \>y the horses from any one
State. The list comprises Sweet Marie,
2:06 J ,i. winner of the fastest five heat
race ever trotted: Bonnie Russell,
2:07*;; Consuela S. 2:07?i: George G.
2:01%; Stanley Dillon. 2:07%; Aristo,
2:0SU; Liscmjero. 2:0S',4; Judge Greene,
2:09?4; Tuna, 2:03^2. and Anaconda,
2:095i. the last named the only pacer
With a record below 2:06 that has ever
entered the list of 2:10 trotters.
For the backs Snedigar is about the
only one that will come through and
go through. Snedlgar has all the dash
of a finished player and it was some of
this spirit that saved the day last year.
Kern, as halfback of last year's fresh
men, acquitted himself handsomely and
the chances are greatly in favor of his
being accepted for a place. Boynton,
who was tried out at fullback last
year, may be used for a half this year.
In. Force and Stern the college has
two premier players for fullback. Both
played a half in that position last year
and demonstrated their fitness.- Force
may be used for the line, however, in
which event there will be nobody to
challenge Stern.
Belknap Is the best for a quarter
back. A 6evere Injury kept him out of
the game last year and Johnny More
was given the place. Belknap Is a cool,
heady player and if he is fortunate to
go through the season without an ac
cident the varsity will be greatly
strengthened by his presence In the big
game.
To .make up for these losses Califor
nia will have to look to its second eleV
en and the freshmen of last year. The
available second eleven men are Reed,
Gray. Phillips, Elliott and Oliver for
the line and Muther. Belknap and
Boynton for the backs. Kern, captain
of the freshmen team, is the best the
baby eleven offers.
Captain Stroud will retain his old po
sition as center, with Phillips a reli
able substitute. For guard Reed, Gray
and Heitmuller are available, though
Heitmuller may be out of it on account
of a late attack of appendicitis. The
tackles will probably be Howard and
Force, though Howard may be changed
to guard and Force retained In his old
place as fullback. A brother of Sam
Stow, last year's crack guard, will en
ter college this year and it is possible
he will fill his distinguished relative's
place, in which event there would be
more shifting about.
For ends there are more candidates
than for any other position. There are
Demeritt of last year's varsity, Oliver.
Coogan, Henry and Caminetti. Oliver
is one of the likeliest, as he fulfilled his
mission splendidly when tried out last
year. -Â¦- Â¦. ;: -
Football practice is already in full
swing at both universities and at the
various preparatory schools and the
sound of the referee's whistle will soon
be heard on the gridiron.
As the University of California is
bound to have a light team this year
on account of the loss of so many of
last year's veterans, it will be the aim
of the coaches to develop a fast team.
Coach Hopper had some experience
with Eastern teams last year and this
experience will be of great value to
California this vear. There will , be
many new tricks to learn In the way of
developing speed and much time will
be spent mastering them.
Dcmeritt. Heitmuller, Stroud and
Howard are the only remaining mem
bers of last year's eleven on the line.
Overall, Stow and Hudson have left
college and have left some big gaps be
hind them, loo. Of the backs there are
remaining Snedigar, Force and Stern,
the absentees being Mini, Whipple and
More.

Drummond MacGavin and Reuben
Hunt both had easy matches and did
not have to play much. Hunt did not
play as well as was expected, but will
probably do better. Nourse made a
good showing against MacGavin.
Trowbridge Hendrick, a likely candi
date for championship honors from
Los Angeles, had an easy time with
Charles Kuelm. Hendrick showed up
well and will be a hard man to beat.
The women's singles did not bring
together the best players and the
matches were rather one-sided. Miss
Ethel Ratcliffe beat Miss Vodden
easily. The score was 6-0. 6-1.

The seventeenth annual tennis tour
nament for the coast championship
opened on the San Rafael courts yes
terday and gives promise of being the
mc-st interesting event of the kind held
in years. The attendance was larger
than usual on opening day and at times
the excitement ran high. The players
as usual suffered from the heat, which,
however, was not as excessive as in
July.
The feature of the day's play was
the match betwesn Percy Murdock of
Alamtda and Herbert Long of this
city. Murdock is a veteran, while his
opponent had played but once before
at San Rafael. Long, altho-ugh beaten.*
played a wonderful game and won a
set from his cleverer opponent. It was
one of the most exciting matches ever
played in a championship tournament.
Both players drove continually and
throughout the match there was not a
dull moment. It was a give and take
affair ar.d the usual long rallies were
lacking. Murdock won the first set
handily. In the second Long did some
great driving, both back hand and fore
hand. He led at 4-2, but Murdock won
the next two games and the score
stood 40-0 in his favor in the ninth
game.
; At this point Long began to take
| chances and passed Murdock repeated
ly, winning the set 6-4. In the third and
fourth sets Long was outplayed, both
sets going to Murdock easily. The
score was 6-1, 4-6. 6-3. 6-1. .
j Harry Rolfe and Stewart Gayness
played five long sets and after three
I hours' play the verdict finally went to
i Rolfe. The score was 7-5, 10-12, 8-6,
j 0-6, 6-0.

Francks to Streib. . Time of gameâ One hour
; and fifty minutes. Umpire â O'Connell.
Just- because' Mr. -Castro did net
squeeze Streib's . fly when he should
have been ready to â¢ glaum anything,
Oakland got away with the game yes
terday, at- Recreation Park with one tc
the good. This all happened In the
fourth round. Before and. a f tor that,
Jake Thielman was the big chief and
he had. the Commuters all groggy and
ready to quit. Scorej Oakland 3, Port
land 2.
Such is .Thielman's luck. He easily
outpitched Schmidt and at that the
smiling German was better than he has
been for . many a moon. The players
on both sides were full of pepper and
ready to scrap all the time. Therefore
the game was one-worth! viewing, for
besides good baseball there was some
excitement thrown in. '
Portland had it one to nothing when
Gunley tore off a single to right in the
fourth. Dunleavy's cranium came in
violent contact with the sphere, but
he recovered quickly and was ready to
run. Schlafley swung through with a
single to left and It was three on the
sacks.
shoved a mean one at Ray
mond and while play of forcing
Schlafley at second' was being pulled
off Ganley arrived.. Kruger immedi
ately pilfered second. and then, on the
next ball pitched, Dunleavy made a
dash for the plate. Streib 'swung on
the ball and away it soared to Castro.
The man from South America was not
there with' the" grab and both runners
reached the pah. in safety.
â¢Portland tried^ hard all the 'time -and
came near tying it, up. Julie Streib's
great work at first- cut off a couple of
runs. Thrice Streib fielded bunts per
fectly to the -second f sack and this
helped some. Â« Schlafley said too much
to the. umpire: In the ninth spasm and
he was promptly chased to the bench,

CHICAGO. Sept. 2.â Talbot Broth
ers' filly Shawana proved easily the
btst i n the feature event at one mile
to-day at. Harlem. Despite Shawana's
excellent showing in her previous
starts, Princess Tulane was made.fa
vorite over her to-day, but failed to
deliver the goods. Aubuchon rode the
winner perfectly. Instead of taking
a long lead as in her former races,
he reserved part of her speed for the
final test. She had only one length
to spare over the Princess until the
stretch was reached. She then drew
away by two lengths, increasing it to
three at the wire, running the course
i:i 1:39 3-5. :-~ *'" ' '
Cardigan, second choice in the
steeplechase, won easily. Class Leader
was made the favorite, but he had
no speed to-day, and could finish no
better than fourth.- The field finished
strung out. Bartley, who had the
mount on Don Ami, was suspended
indefinitely for his lack of effort with
the horse. After taking a few jumps
Don Ami leisurely cantered out of the
course. Bartley seemed to make no
effort to keep him in. Summaries:

Continued wet weather In the Northwest
caused firmneit In wheat at t.ie opening, De
cember being up a shade to MQ%c. at $1 C9Vs
to $1 00%. - Foreign grain markets, however,
failed to respond to the strength manifested
[ here yesterday, and this indifference soon made
itself, felt among pit traders nere. 'After the
initial advance there was considerable profit
taking, which quickly dlfsipated all the open
ing' gains. A noticeable feature of trading
was the smaller- volume of, business. Several
prominent longs were -moderate sellers and
there was also fair selling by smaller holders.
Th.Â« !Â»*ort session -of the Hoard of Trade to
day followed by a' holiday was responsible for
some of the selling pressure. The market
was further, weakened; later In the day by a
revised estimate of the tota; yield of wheat
for Minnesota and the Dakotas, made by a well
known Minneapolis croD exoert, whoso figures
showed it slight increase in the crop com
pared with h previous statement. Accord
ing to this authority, the total yield of the
three States would approximate Â¦ 137,000,000
bushels. The fact that country elevator stocks
In the Northwe/it were increasing also had
a depressing Influence. Â¦ A report of . a .St.
Louit; trade jaurnal statin? that the weather
in the Southwest was favorable for fall seed
ing wai another ' bear factor. The market
continued weak the remainder of the day, the
close beinx at the low > point, with December
at $1 07%.
Sentiment in the corn pit was affected by
large local and primary receipts. December
opened H@i,ic higher, at -527,0 tOj52?4c, de
clined to 61%c and closed at 51%@32e.
Trading in oats was exceedingly quiet,".De
cember opened a shade lower to higher, at
;;:Â¦;?; o to S'l%c, sold off; to 3314c and closed
at 33Â«ic. :..Â¦
. Provisions were weak, largely . as a result
.of lack of demand, trading in hog products
being. almont at a standstill. The decline in
grains also had some. effect. May pork closed

Wheat and Other Grains. Â¦
WHEATâ The French markets were firm,
with higher futures. The , English markets
were not materially changed.
Chicago was lower. Chicago wires to E. F.
Hutton & Co. said: - â¢ â¢
'"All the grain exchanges will be open to
morrow. Minneapolis says: Here is Septem
ber 1 and there are still acres and acres of
Wheat in the Northern Dakotas and most of
Canada that are still uncut. Raining all over
the three States. Looks as if we would get
what we had last year and year before, a wet
harvest. Jones figures by States as follows:
Minnesota, 65.000.00U bushels: North Dakota,
45.000,000; South Dakota. 27.000,000. making
137.COO.000 for the three States. The Modern
Miller says: Excellent weather continues for
seeding ot winter Wheat. The soil is In fine
condition nearly everywhere to give the Wheat
plant a good start thia fall. The prospects are
for a larger acreage owing to the high prices
prevailing at present. The marketing of this
year's Wheat continues -ifree. but the. quality
of grain is unusually low in test weight.
Farmers are holding much of their choice
Wheat In granaries for higher prices."
In this market there was a drop of 2%o In
futures, caused by a selling fever among. some
overbought bulls, who unloaded their holdings
owing to the Chicago decline. The cash grain
showed no further change.

Trade in the fruit market was much quieter
than at any time during the past week, but
steady prices ruled for most descriptions of
orchard fruits, as stocks were none too heavy
and dealers were expecting a good demand for
the extra Sunday trade. Quinces and Figs
were plentiful and weak, but other tree fruits
.stood as previously quoted and occasional sales
of fine Plums and Prunes In small shipping
packages were reported at a slight advance
over the outside quotation. Table Grapes were
abundant and weak for general offerings. Wine
Grapes attracted but little attention and there
were about eight carloads lying around the
market. Occasional sales of Antioch stock
were reported at $18 per ton. while Fresno
lots found a few buyers at $14@15. BerrieÂ«
and Melons were in fair request and the
former cleaned up well. A carload of extra

The ususl normal monthly slump for July
has= not fully lÂ«-r-n dissipated, but September
will probably Tick up the betterment that iÂ«
Â¦ moirmed. July is always a weak month
anfl Augaft sMmf to have porf-e^ff-d a slighter
run of evidences along the same line. Prices
in both the pine* ar.d redwood are tetter,
with a prowing improvement In demand. In
thp pine circles the base rate of $12 is being
maintained, whii-h means an improvement of
nearly $* in the better grades. Building is
active and the general tone of the market
is far healthier than in July, although not
fo strons as In August of last yesr.
The pir.e mill owners of the Pacific North
v**5t ir.et in Tecoma on the 27th and agreed
that it would be for the be?t interests of the
manufacturers to cut down the output. Th*
result was that the owners agreed almost
Rf a whole to operate five out of six days and
ieesen th* number cf working hours.
â¢~"dar shingles are fairly artive, with ex
rÂ»l!ent prospect* or betterment. The mills
arÂ» active in their output efforts and the
Eastern and Coast orders should materially
lacnsM <iuring September.
Redwood shingles are string through the
rffortt of the association, which is ever an
improving clement In the market conditions
of California. The more important non-mem
hÂ«-rs are etronply considering the advisability
r>f entering thÂ«-lr names on the roll and If this
if done the effect upon the general shingle
F-.tuaticn will be most beneficial. Prices re
main strong though stationary, while the
Eastern ar.d local calls for the mill products
hrf gradually demonstrating the fact that the
redwood #hirxle 's popular all over the world.
Redwood mill products are active and there
f'-tr.s to be a generally better feeling on the
part cf the manufacturer*. Jobbers and re
t a Hern. The dealer* are holding closer to
the 15 price list and this means that trade
is rrowlng etronger ar.d more encouraging. All
In all. the lumber rituatlon Is far more nor

Union Pacific* convertibles were especially
large, and the demand for Japanese 6s brought
a EjlBht advance.

Supervisor d'Ancona as the result of
his investigations will recommend that
the contract .with Hagan â¢& Kelly for
the burial of indigent dead be not com
pleted. The firm is at present operat
ing under a resolution of the Board of
Supervisors, but the contract has never
been signed. :
-D'Ancona sa#s that steps will be at
once taken to utilize the appropriation
of $5000 made in the last budget for the
purchase of a city cemetery. .As soon
as this is done the city itself will bury
the indigent dead.
An effort will be made to have the
bodies taken from city' institutions for
burial to the Morgue, instead of taking
them to the barn on Nineteenth street,
as Hagan & Kelly are at present, doing.
D'Ancona thinks a barn hardly a fit
place for the reception of the dead. The
bodies will.be kept at the Morgue until
the time for their transfer to the bury
ing ground. -
"The -manner of burying the city's
dead has been no worse than it always
was," said d'Ancona. "The fault lies in
the contract system that has been in
vogue. As to the taking ..away of the
wrong body, from' the hospital morgue
and its subsequent burial, I am unable
to say. whether the mistake was due to
Hagan &Kelly or to the man In charge,
"the regular morgue keeper having been
absent on account of illness. However,
we intend to remedy the matter, and
think we will do so when the city itself
doe3 the work. \ I have'; instructed Ha

The San Francisco Teachers' Club
gave a farewell reception to Deputy

Girls' High School last night. Professor
Suzzallo has been recently appointed
lecturer on education in the teachers'
college of Columbia University. He has
resigned his position in the San Fran

shortly to take up his new work.
Professor Suzzallo is a Californian
and has received most of his education
and experience on this coast. He -is a
graduate of the State Normal* School
at San Jose and of the Stanford Uni
versity. He is regarded here as a bril
liant scholar' in educational theory and
a man of rare executive power in prac
tical affairs. 'Â¦'.â¢'
His popularity was indicated by the
large number of teachers that assem
bled to bid him farewell. Sneaking for
the principals and teachers, A. L.
Mann, president of the club, said that
he ho;>ed the future would bring as
much success to the guest of the even
ing as the past had done. '.

COURTMARTIALIS POSTPONED
The Supreme Court handed down a
decision" yesterday. affirming the right
of the Montecito Water Company to flf-.
teen miner's inches of the natural flow
of the Cold Springs, branch of Montecito
Creek. The city of Santa Barbara and
the corporations owning the Eaton and
Barker tunnels "are directed to observe
this. ruling for the future and -to pay
damages for (Certain amounts of water
that they have taken in the past. All
four parties to the contest will be al
lowed to' continue taking water, but the
Montecito Company's supply must not
be curtailed. The Superior Court is or
dered to fix the amount of damages
to the plaintiff and apportion it among
the, defendants^
The Montecitflr company possessed an
acknowledged right to fifteen miner's
inches of the- water in the creek. The
defendants did not attempt to take
water from the stream, but they con
structed tunnels along the banks of it;
Percolation caused an immediate cur
tailment of the. Montecito company's
supply. ..'.v*;.*>^ . .
The court found that of , the fifteen
miner's inches to which the plaintiff
was entitled the Eaton tunnel took 1.43
Inches, the Barker tunnel 2.25 inches
and the city of Santa Barbara 4.16
inches. The lower court ordered the de
fendants ;.to refrain taking any
of the Montecito' company's water- in
the future, , and, directed that another
action be begun'in relation to the ques
tion of damages. All parties to the con
test appealed. .
The case differs *, from the famous
Katz-Walkinshaw contest ] In that the
water in the proceeding at bar was not
used on riparian land, but was carried
to a distance,' and consequently a dif
ferent interpretation of the law is given
to meet the different conditions. Â«
As an -explanation of his- belief Pene
sets' forth that for years his wife has
been in almost daily and nightly, habit
of visiting "somnambulists, mediums
and card readers," and that she has
paid as high as $5 and $10 for a "ses
sion." He supplied the funds. He re
cites the fact that because of the
mother's cruelty one of his daughters
fled from home and he was obliged to
place the other in a convent. Â¦ Pene
says his property â¢ is worth not more
than $8400, instead, of $12,000, as alleged
in his wife's complaint- . Â¦ . (
Judge Hunt granted a divorce to

thiir. three-room home at 545 Thirty
ninth street with piano boxes. The

terial and pasted. with newspapers. The

one of his hobbies. Judge Hunt award

B. Wilcox..a, minister, of the gosp6l.
She has only recently learned that Van
Horn married Eloise M. Morton at
Lake Park, Minn., in December; 1S95,
and that the former wife is still living
and.undivorced.
In an answer filed yesterday in the
Superior Court by John Baptiste Pene
to the suit for divÂ« rce begun last week
"by|Mary Louise Pene the husband
Â¦makes no charge of iiifldelity, but de
clares that his wife will not live with
him because she says she "has a sec
ond husband to whom she must remain
faithful until released by him." The
identity of the "second husband" is not
disclosed, but Pene advisedly declares
that he believes the second spouse to
"be a mythical person who exists only
in the imagination of the plaintiff.',*
Judge Morrow does , not consider a
college education essential 'to make a
good lawyer, as some of the best in the
country have spent 'little time in the
schoolroom. He considers country prac
tice the best training, as ;it is more
general and a man" is forced .to do all
his own work instead of depending on
clerks, as in the city. : ' '?>?>(?
Some valuable advice to young men
about to begin the study of law - was
given by Circuit Judge" Morrow in the
Young Men's Christian Association au
ditorium last night. Judge Morrow
mentioned a few points which he said
it would" be useful for young attorneys
to remember.
In the first -place he suggested that
they get familiar with business affairs
and the personality of men. It is also
useful to cultivate a literary habit and
set some knowledge of good literature.
The . works of any of the classical
writers were.. recommended and the
Bible in particular.' was singled out as
a'' book which should be carefully,
studied, irrespective of religious beliefs
or tendencies, for its literary merit.
The most important point* the
speaker said,, is -for' a lawyer, to "know
the' method of procedure, as there are
more cases reversed .owing to the lack
of knowledge- on this point than .for
any other, reason. In other- prefessions
the technique is taught, but with law
yers it seems to be absolutely'forgot
ten.
