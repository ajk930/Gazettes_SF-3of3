LOS ARCOS, Sonora, Mexico, June
24.â Investigation by Americans Into
the murder of three American mining
men, whose bodies were found in a
water hole near this place, shows that
the crime was one of the most diabol
ical in the history of this section,
where crimes of violence are frequent.
Robbery was the motive, and there is
evidence of the organization of a gang
of Mexican bandits whose purpose is
to kill American mining men for the
double purpose of plundering their out
fits and to prevent their securing valu
able mines. As to this alleged conspir
acy little can be said at present, for the
American party, assisted by represent
atives of the Government, is conducting
an investigation, which is in secret.
Four men are under arrest charged
with the murders, and it is known they
were near the scene of the murders re
cently. One of the victims had been
shot in the back, , evidently while fish-'
ing. The face of another man was beat
en and mashed to a pulp by rocks. Fin
ger marks in his throat showed that he
had been choked. The third man's
hands had been tied and he had been
gagged. His head was torn by a glanc
ing bullet wound, but he had evidently
been killed by a knife thrust Just above
his heart. They had probably been tor
tured... the assassins hoping to learn
something of the money ; the party
might have had. The first of the three
men found .had evidently fought for his
life, as pieces of his torn shirt were
lying on the bank.

Both Perdicaris and Varley are

Perdicaris was received at his town

GALVESTON. Tex., June 24.âTele
graphic advices received here to-day
from Indian Territory are to the ef
fect that the followers of Chito Hargo,
better known as the "Snake" band of
Indians, have organized near Conway
to res.lst the allotment "'of land "iri"lfief
Chickasaw nation. Reports state that
these dissatisfied Indians have pur
chased Winchesters, also heavy sup
plies of ammunition. Large numbers
of the band have held a meeting In the
hills and have threatened to kill the
members of the Dawes Commission if
any attempt is made to force them to
take arbitrary allotments.
Three years ago Chito Hargo and his
band started an uprising in the Creek
Nation, which caused no end of trouble
to the Government. These Indians
have been considered peaceable except
when they are stirred up by the lead
ers upon some question which they
think involves their survival. Then
they go on the warpath and indulge
in rapid murder and destruction, as in
the old days of frontier settlement. Be
cause of this they have been carefully
watched.

LONDON. June 23.â The Morning
Leader's Paris correspondent says
that the mystery concerning Kent J.
Loomls, brother of the assistant Secre
tary of State, has been cleared up.
"Mr. Loomis," the dispatch says,
"appeared in Paris to-day (Friday) and
left this evening on his way to North
east Africa, accompanied by Mr. Col
lins, the son of a v well-known American
journalist."
AH the morning newspapers, with tha
exception of the Morning Leader, treat
the disappearance of Kent J. Loomls
as a serious affair. None of the special
dispatches from Paris confirm the dis
patch sent by the Morning Leader cor
respondent, saying that Loomls waa
seen in Paris yesterday and left last
night on his way to Abyssinia. So far
as London is concerned the disappear
ance of Loomis continues to be shoud
ed In the deepest mystery. The Lon
don manager of the North German
Lloyd line is quoted as saying that the
matter has become a serious one, as
every effort to find Loomis has failed.
Loomls was proceeding to Abyssinia
to deliver to Emperor Menelik the re
cently * signed cdmmerclal- treaty be
tween the United States and Abyssinia.*
It has now been arranged with Wil
liam H. Ellis, who accompanied
Loomls from New York, to proceed to
Abyssinia with the treaty, which was
in the baggage of Loomls and was
brought here from Cherbourg.
Ellis left Paris for Marseilles to-day,
where he will take the steamer Oxus
to-morrow for Jibutll, whence he will
proceed inland to the capital of Abys
sinia. He will be gone about four
months.
Ellis positively declines to state
whether he had the commercial treaty
between the United States and Abys
sinia, but It has been learned from a
reliable source that the treaty la in
his possession.

SAN RAFAEL, June 24.â Patrick Ma
guire, an inmate of the public alms
house in Marin County, learned yes
terday that he is a rich man. By the
regular legal course his claim to an in
terest in a $100,000 estate was estab
lished. The friends of theold man were
overjoyed at the good news, and they
hastened to his humble cot in the In
firmary. But there was no smile on Ma.
guire's face.
"Let me stay here," he replied. "1
long ago knew that some day a part of
my sister's wealth would be mine, but
I did not ask for it. She did not know
I was in this place, and I kept her ig
norant of my whereabouts. My days
are numbered and I do not need the
money. I want to stay here, which is
home to me. To go elsewhere would be
to enter an uneasy life."
- And so Patrick Maguire refuses to
desert the life of an Indigent to go even
to a hospital, where he would receive
every attention that money can supply.
A little more than a year ago Mrs.
Hugh McDermott.of San Mateo died,
leaving a large estate. She left no will,
and- there apparently being no direct
heirs, relatives have since been contest
ing.over a division of the realty.
V Maguire knew that by merely estab
lishing 'his identity he would be en
titled to , a major portion of the estate,
but he* kept his secret until recently,
when t . he. explained all to the Rev.
Father Byrnes. The priest wrote to the
executors explaining the circumstances.
The rest was a matter of detail. Ma
guire will receive his part of the estate.
Perhaps he may never enjoy the bene
fits of his fortune, for he is now almost
70 years* ~old and paralysis holds him
prostrate.
Maguire is a pioneer of the State. He
came to Marin County forty-two years
ago and accumulated a fortune, but it
dwindled away by reverses, and for
more than a year he has been a pauper.

which has to do with her title to cer
tain valuable real estate left to her by
her father, J. P. Treadwell. For sev
eral years Joseph W. Reay, as a squat
ter, has been contesting the Treadwell
title to what was designated as "out
side lands" of San Francisco. It was
alleged that Reay was in possession,
by occupancy of the land, since
March 8, 1866, but in October, 1885.
the heirs of the deceased Treadwell
applied for a grant from the city. The
title has been in controversy ever

property In question was left to Maud.
It is located at and about the corner
of Fulton street and Masonic avenue,
which in these days of growth Is a de

The Injunction to restrain the city
from giving a deed to Maud Treadwell

An overdose of wood alcohol proved
fatal yesterday evening In the case of
Mrs. Emma Hylahd. The woman was
discovered ' in an unconscious condi
tion in\her room at 1558 Polk street
and from one of her friends it waa
thought that she took the alcohol by
mistake, believing it to tie a medicinal
preparation. Subsequent Investiga
tion brought to light the fact that
early yesterday morning she swallowed
a quantity of the poison, from which
she suffered severely during the day,
and last evening about 6 o'clock she
took another large dose. From this it
is inferred that it was not .through
error but with suicidal Intent that Mrs.
Hyland drank the alcohol. Despite
heroic treatment by Emergency Sur
geon Wiliam Stevens she remained un
conscious and died a few hours after
reaching the hospital. She was a
widow, about 30 years of age, and
nothing Is known of her antecedents.

The communication was referred to
the executive committee of the council
for consideration.
A communication was received by the
secretary of the Labor Council from
President Gompers urging all unions In
San Francisco to unite under one ban
ner, calling Itself a central labor body.
A resolution to this effect was Intro
duced at the Labor Council last night
and referred to the executive commit
tee with instructions t~ Invite the co
operation of all unions affiliated with
the Labor Council, the Building Trades
Council and the City Front organiza
tion. The total amount to be realized
by this method of assessment will ag
gregate about ?450O, which it Is thought
will be sufficient for the purposes.
Should more be needed, the unions will
cheerfully respond.
To accomplish all this a per capita
tax of 15 cents on all union members
affiliated or unafflllated with the San
Francisco Lajbor Council Is recommend
ed by the committee on arrangements.
Preparations on an extensive scale
are being made by the several labor
organizations of - San Francisco to en

the officers and men reason to hope for
a substantial result. The programme
was rendered by the Golden City

In view of the. recent action of the
longshoremen of Astoria In refusing
to work with sailors aooard foreign
bound vessels, the Sailors' Union of the
Pacific, regarding the stand taken by
the longshoremen as inimical to its
own interests, has adopted the follow
ing resolution:
Whereas, ThÂ« third i annual convention of
the Pacific Coast branch of the International
Longshoremen's Association, held at Astoria,
Or.. June 6 to Â». inclusive, adopted a resolu
tion declaring that 'members of longshoremen's
unions refuse to work with sailors, doing long,
shore work on foreign-going vessels; and.
Whereas, In so far as the resolution here
olted is intended to operate against the mem
bers of any vessel's crew (or substitutes em
ployed temporarily In place thereof) while en
gaged in any capacity In connection with hand
ling of cargo on board ships. It Is calculated to
work a dental of the eeaman's right to all work
done "inside the rail," and is consequently an
Infringement upon the legitimate Interests of
the seamen; therefore, be It
"Resolved, By the Sailors' Union of the Pa
cific that members of this union hereby declare
their Insistence at all times upon the right to
perform any and all kinds of labor, including
handling. cÂ«ygo inside the rail, hin
drance or objection upon the part of any other
organization; further
Resolved, That the members of this union
also declare their determination to take such
steps as ma'y be necessary in any case to in
sure the prompt dispatch of vessels affected
by the conditions herein set forth.
The speakers at the banquet will be
Chief Justice Beatty, former Justices
Ourr*>y, Wallace, Searls and Rhodes,
and a response by some Federal Judge
not yet selected. The speeches will be
largely reminiscent.
Judge Augustus Loring Rhodes, th?
special guest of the occasion, has been
a practicing attorney for fifty-eight
years. He was born in Oneida County,
New York, in 1821. and was admitted to
the bar in Indiana in 1S46. With one or
two exceptions he has been engaged lu
the practice of law longer than any oth
er attorney in the State. Judge Rhodes
<ame to California in 1S54, and in 1S56
began the practice of law in this city,
at that time forming a partnership
With the late P. O. Minor. In 1859 he
was elected District Attorney in this
county, and In 1860 was elected State
Senator to represent Santa Clara and
Alameda counties. Judge Rhodes was
elected a member of the Supreme Court
of the State of California in 1S63, and
on January 1, 1854, be took his seat In
that court. He was a member of -that
court for sixteen years, and from 1870
to 1872 was Chief Justice. In 1879, when
the new constitution was adopted, he
Â¦was a candidate for Chief Justice, but
was defeated by Robert F. Morrison
by a small majority. He then retired
from the bench and took up the active
practice of law. having an office in San
Francisco. His practice took him prin
cipally before the Supreme Court of the
United States and he argued some of
the most important cases on the Pacific
Coast before that body. On the death
of Judge A. H. Kittredge In 1899, Gov
ernor Gage appointed him a Judge of
the Superior Court of this county. In
jyOO he was unanimously elected to a
full term in the Superior Court, having
received the nomination of the Repub
lican, Democratic and Good Govern
ment parties. >.
The banquet will be limited to mem
bers of the bar, and it is expected that
125 members will be present. Many in
quiries have been received for seats
from lawyers in San Francisco and
other cities of the State. A score of

bers of the bar.

The freight handlers of the Southern
Pacific railroad sheds who went out on
strike three weeks ago to-night de
cided last evening to remain out.
The meeting was held in Manzanita
Hall, and was an exciting one from
opening to adjournment. The advocates
for no strike made a strong plea to
have the move called off, and those in
favor of holding out worked hard for
votes among their weaker members. At
the secret ballot the result stood 103 to
67 in favor of the strike. The union
will canvass the labor localities and
societies to< obtain work and assistance
for its idle members and continue Its
efforts to, bring the company to terms.
Tht prisoners were taken to Teras,
guarded by the entire posae of ten
Americans and Mexicans, and were
thrown into jail at that town. Brooks,
the Chief of Police, S and members of
their. ..party, waited long enough to get
fresh- horses and supplies before re
suming the chase of "Chihuahua" and
three others of the band who escaped.
The bushes failed to prove a good
shelter from the merciless .fire poured
in on them by the posse and, suddenly
abandoning their pack horses, they
leaped In their saddles and made a
break for the open country, firing as
they rode. Fortunately for the posse
and the Chief of Police, two of the out
laws were thrown ln~a collision between
their horses. The mounts of two others
were shot down, and still another two
fell from their saddles, brought down
by bullets from the rifles of. the pur
suing party. Their wounds are not
necessarily fatal.
Four of the^ bandits, one of whom was
wounded in 'the fight in the bushes,
escaped in the running fight, but the
six are considered a big capture, as
papers belonging to one of the Max
wells were found oh two of them, and
the officers have reason to believe that
a third was with the two when the
crime was committed. Two of the other
prisoners have been positively identi
fied as the murderers of members of
the Mormon colony.
The band of renegades is headed by
"Chihuahua/ 1 an old bandit, but he. is
not among the six captured. Brooks
and several of his men met the Chief
of Police of Teras ' and a party 'near
that place, and together they started
in pursxiit cf the outlaws, trailing them
through a rough country until they
were finally surjrounded in a thick
undergrowth. Realizing that they were
cornered, the outlaws were prepared
for a battle, 'and at approach of .the
posse tho fight began. The outlaw
band numbered ten.

Annie Anderson yesterday alleged that
she had procured employment at Daw.
son. Alaska, and was about to begin
work to earn her livelihood when
Charles offered her J3000 to give up her

Capp is employed as an expert horse
keeper at the Burlingame Country
Club's grounds In Burlingame.
A man passed on the other side of the
street and Capp made a move as if to
cry out. The footpad with the gun no
ticed the move and in a grating whis
per told him to keep quiet or he would
blow his head down the street. Seeing
resistance useless, Capp, much against
his will, submitted to the fingers of the
robber who was industriously rifling
his pockets.
When they had obtained all the
horseman's wealth, the footpads backed
away. The little man's mask fell
down, exposing a face wearing a black
mustache. Capp says he will be able
to recognize the crook again. Leaving
their victim with another warning to
make no alarm, the thieves ran down
the alley in the direction of Bush street
and disappeared.
Capp immediately reported the mat
ter to the Central police station and
Detective Charles Taylor was detailed
on the case and arrested Frank Smith,
a marine, who had been dishonorably
discharged from the navy. A few hours
later Smith was allowed to go. but last
night the police were again looking
for him.
' Capp had been spending the evening
at the Hammam Baths. 8hortly after
1 o'clock he started for the Lick House
to visit a friend, with whom he had an
appointment. He had reached Trinity
street,, a small alleyway running from
Sutter to Bush streets, between Kearny
and Montgomery, when two masked
men jumped from the darkness and,
pressing guns in. his face, commanded
him to throw up his hands. Capp com
piled with alacrity. The taller of the
two thugs held a huge revolver beneath
Capp's nose, warning him not to make
an outcry if he valued his life. "Shell
out everything of value that you've
got," the highwayman demanded.
While Capp quivered before the muzzle
of the revolver, the smaller footpad
cleaned out his pockets of everything
of value.
"Make a move and 1'IT blow your
head to the other end of the alley."
was the startling announcement made
early yesterday morning to George T.
Capp. a horse trainer of 131 O'Farrell
street, as he was walking on Sutter
street near Montgomery. At the points
of pistols two footpads held up and
robbed the unfortunate pedestrian of
?22 50 in cash, a diamond pin worth
$150 and a gold watch and fob valued
at $30.
At the western end of the hall 13
the orator's gallery or music-room,
while in the southeast corner of the
hall is the room containing lockers for
the six secretaries of the various or
ganizations of the order who will use
the lodgeroom.
In the rear of the lodgeroom on the
same floor are the smoking and recep
tion rooms, besides a full complement
of smaller rooms for initiatory pur
poses.
The lodgeroom is on the third floor
at the east end of the building. Over
the staircase is the armory, while im
mediately below is the chapter room
of the knight commanders, the latter
room being finished in blue.
A brief description of the building
follows: On the upper floor of the
south side of the building are spacious
Vestibules. To the right Is the lodge
room proper. The great star that "or
naments the dome is lighted by sixty
incandescent lamps, hung thirty feet
above the floor, which is sixty-five
feet In length by forty in width. The
celling is encircled by a row of lights
that increase the number of incandes
cents in the room to about 218.
The four stations, one on each side
of the hall, are marvels of beauty.
That at the east is inShe Doric style,
typifying wisdom; on the north the
station is Corinthian, symbolical of
beauty, and the west is Ionic, emble
matic of stength, while that in the
couth is composite, signifying that the
order combines three qualities repre
sented by the three foregoing styles of
architecture.
This was followed by a reception to
the Grand Lodge officials and other
visitors by the local Masonic bodies.
At 10 o'clock the buffet in the ban
quet room was opened and the Ma
sons and their friends partook of a
fine luncheon.

The earth has nourished es through us

Have you ever thoueht that it is probable
that the earth supplies ns with the means
to keep oar bodily vigor, our health, if we
only knew it? The animals know by in-
stinct what is good for them and will search
until they find in some plant what they
need for correcting indigestion or constipa-
tion, etc. Is it, therefore, not possible that
there are roots and herbs supplied by nature
which will care the diseases that afflict
hnman kind? That is why Dr. Pierce, of
Bngalo, N. Y., has such faith in his "Med-
ical Discovery." Years ago, when he wn
in general and active practice, he found
that a combination of certain herbs and
roots made into an alterative extract, with-
out the nse of alcohol, would always pat

ish the tissues, feed the blood and nerves

off shore.

wounded.
"The Japanese on June 22 had not

CHICAGO, June 24. â The Daily News to-night publishes the following cable from its corre
spondent at Chefu*:
"Another demonstration took place off Port Arthur yesterday. The firing began from the
forts about 10 a. m. and continued till 1 p. m. . The programme was about the same as on the pre
vious day. The destroyers and torpedo-boats pursued the same tactics and the auxiliary cruisers lay
off the islands until the firing bad ceased, when the flotilla proceeded eastward at full speed.
"At 8:30 the same evening firing began heavily from the bluff, with much activity ot
searchlights, indicating the approach of torpedo craft. A little later sounds of more distant firing
were heard, evidently from the land side of Port Arthur, continuing until this morning at 5 o'clock.
During that period there was an almost uninterrupted thunder, as of field guns and volley firing,
"Owing to tne 'warnings of the Japanese that should the dispatch-boat Fawn approach the
coast at night their boats would not be responsible for its safety, it was impossible to obtain more
"It is probable, however, that what took place was a general shore action, with naval
demonstrations. It seems as though the Japanese are endeavoring to wear out the defenders by

LIAOYANG; June 24.â It is reported
that Generals Oku and Kuroki have
Jcined forces, and are advancing from
the direction of Vafangow.
There is talk of a serious engagement
6hortly. It is also rumored that the
Japanese forces which were recently
advancing In this direction have fallen
back on Fengwangcheng.
The state of tension existing may be
illustrated by the fact that the value of
the ruble fell mysteriously at the
Russo-Chinese Bank. At first this was
thought to be the effect of the result of
the battle of Vafangow, but it was dis
covered later that Chinese from Port
Arthur had declared that the fortress
had been evacuated and that the troops
had sailed off on a number of British
ships. The value of the ruble has now
returned to the normal.

ST. LOUIS. June 24.â It is reported
at the New York City building at the
World's Fair that a prominent New
York Democrat, on behalf of Tammany,
asked David R. Francis to permit his
name to go before the Democratic con
vention for President. It Is said that
this agent was sent to St. Louis by
Leader Murphy of Tammany, who is
casting about for a candidate suitable
to Tammany and against Parker. In
his conference with President Francis,
the New Yorker pointed out that no
candidate would enter the convention
with enough votes to nominate and
that when the deadlock came, as it
seems certain to do, his name could be
placed before the convention as a com
promise candidate who could command
enthusiastic support of both the East
and "West.
It is said President Francis consented
to allow his name to go before the con
vention. President Francis declines to
discuss the story.

represent 25,030 men of Chicago. They
charged Governor Peabody with vio
lating his oath of office In deporting
union men, characterized the union
3r.cn of Colorado as peaceful and law
abiding citizens and closed by saying:
"We mourn the fact that we are un
able to duplicate with regard to him
his acts of deportation, and being thus
situated, that we hereby order that the
charter of this organization be draped
In mourning bo long as Governor Pea
hody Ehall remain in the city."
After the intruders had presented
their resolutions, at the same time ad
vising Governor Peabody to get out of
Chicago, the Governor of Colorado had
something to say. .
"I suppose you would like to see r%e
driven out of Chicago, but let me tell
you that I Ehall stay here as long as I
have business here," he said. "These
resolutions are a rack of malicious lies.
At no time since my incumbency as
chief executive of the State of Colorado
have I ever opposed a labor union.
"But I will say that among the union
men in Colorado there are and have
been a number of dynamiters, an
archists and murderers. If you men
and your friends countenance and in
dorse euch methoOs as those that have
Â¦wiped out so many precious lives in the
mining districts of Colorado, then I
must say that you are no better."
The Governor did not tell his friends
of th? incident until a short time before
his departure from Chicago to-night.

lhat he had been delegated by the
board of business agents of the Build-
Ing Trades Council of Chicago to pre

The Life of the Cell.
It is no extravagance" and no mere
figure of speech to say that cells move
about with apparent purpose, that they
feel, that they suffer and enjoy, " that
they absorb and assimilate food, that
they live, love, marry, propagate and
die. And we can say with as much
truth that they think. But of this last
mentioned function it will be well to
defer discussion until a subsequent
time. The cell, therefore, does all that
the man does, has all that the man
has, and possesses within its tiny, com
pass heart, vein, muscle,; nerve, artery,
skin, bone, cartilage and what-not, of
the future organism 'of the composi
tion of which it forms one of the ulti

the syllable 'ar' â the penult â the one

SANTA ROSA, June 24.â The seven
teenth annual State convention of the
California Christian Endeavor Union
will be held in Santa Rosa from June
29 to July 3, Inclusive, and the conven
tion probably will be the most Import
ant ever held by the Endeavorers.
Those young people are coming to
Santa Rosa by the hundreds, and it is
believed there will be a religious
awakening in this city as a result of
holding the convention here.
The last convention of the. society
held here was in 1892, at which the
high mark of attendance was reached,
and, judging from reports of the num
bers coming from all portions of the
State, the coming Â¦ ' convention will
eclipse all records for' attendance since
that time.. Special trains have been
arranged to bring. the Southern Cali
fornia delegations. I Specials will also
bring the Santa Clara County delega
tion to this city, and from Alameda
County a special train will be run one
day during the convention.
Many eminent speakers will be pres
ent at the convention, and an Interest
ing programme has been arranged for
the sessions. The Athenaeum, the
largest hall in Santa Rosa, has been
engaged for the sessions, and other
meetings will also be held at the First
Presbyterian . Church.- All the State
officers are expected here.
Local "committees have been hard at
work for some time past, and will have
everything in a state of perfection be
fore the time for the convening of the
Endeavorers. Dr. David P. Anderson
is chairman of the executive commit
tee, and he is being ably. assisted by

a corporal his pay is advanced to &
cents a day, and when he reaches ser
geant's rank he gets 10 cents for his

The executive committee of the Order
of Hoo Hoos held a meeting and an
nounced to-night that the Hoo Hoo
building, which was destroyed by fire,
would be rebuilt and ready for occu
pancy within fourteen days.
Fearing the Texas building would be
destroyed, the women of that State
vorked heroically to save precious
relics of early history. Sheets were
torn from beds in the building and
used to carry the relics to places of
greater safety. One point of the star
shaped building of Texas is within
seventy-five feet of the house of Hoo
Hoo. and in the large first-floor room
of this point the relics have been on
exhibition. They include pictures,
books, papers and various articles
identified with the early history of *"he
State, and are priceless. Nothing but
the fact that the wind was not blowing
toward the Texas building saved it.
The house of Hoo Hoo was one of the
lirst buildings finished tor the exposi
tion. It was erected by the lumbermen
of the United States, but under the
control of the local board of the Order
of Hoo Hoo. It was divided into many
j oorrjs, constructed of different kinds
of fine and expensive lumbers. Aside
from this, there were specimens of rare
woods which were valued highly.
There were thirty black cats in the
building at the time of the fire, and
These perished.
But ten minutes before " the alarm
lioni tht house of Hoo Hoo, the World's
l'air fire department had answered a
ttlll alarm from the mysterious Asia
concession on tha Pike, where fire had
s-tftrttd in an elephant barn. The loss
v as insignificant, but there was a wild
namped-j of elephants and camels, the
frightened trumpeting of the former
awakening people on all parts of the
grounds. None of the animals escaped
Irom the building.
The ftrc department responded
j.Tomptly. but the rapid spreading of
the flames rendered its attempts to
extinguish the fire valueless, and all
effort was directed toward saving the
Texas, German. Oregon and Mines and
jtfetals buildings, all of which were
threatened with destruction on account
of Cying shincles. All were saved with
out damage.
ST. LOUIS, June Zi. â Fire which
thiv-atened for a. time to destroy many
buildings at the World's Fair, to-day
consumed the house of Hoo Hoo, ren
dcrins the building and all contents a
total loss. So quickly did the flames
thread after the fire started that the
occupants of the building, five in num
ber, all on the second floor, had dif
riculty in escaping with their lives.
The loss on the building and contents
is estimated at J50.O00. The fire is sup
posed to nave started from an electric
Ji^ht wire.

It is not certain that Swayze delib
erately Jumped from the window. It
is thought , by many that when he
heard the door of the private office
being opened he crawled out on the
window ledge and endeavored to hang
by his hands in a mad attempt to es
cape detection: Marks in the dust on
the window ledge show wnere his fin
gers gradually dragged across it until
his bold was lost. This is taken to in
dicate that he did not intend to Jump.
The Chamber of Commerce building
is at the corner of Griswold and State
streets, one block from the busiest
shopping districts.
Before Swayze's body whirled
through thÂ» air, the attention of people
had been attracted to the building by
the cries of Miss Alvord as she fought
at the window against being hurled to
the street and by the pistol shots.
Scores saw Swayze fall and hundreds,
of men, women and children were. on
the scene almost before the body was
picked up.
Swayze was 53 years of age and
leaves a wife and two children.
Occupants of a building across the
street from the Chamber of Commerce
say that Swayze attempted to throw
Miss Alvord out of the window. Her
head and shoulders were seen across
the ledge, and she was fighting desper
ately.
Then the conple disappeared from the
window and the shots rang out, fol
lowed by Swayze's mad^lunge.
A letter written by Swayze was
found, which explains the tragedy.
The letter says Miss Alvord was re
sponsible for Swayze losing his posi
tion at the House of Correction.
Miss Alvord is an employe of a sew
ing machine company, but worked at
the House of Correction when Swayze
Â¦was there. Her home is said to be at
Saginaw, Mich.
PEDESTRIANS ARE HORRIFIED.
Miss Alvord told the physician at
tending her to tell the reporters that
Swayze sent her a telephone message
that he was going to shoot her as a
birthday present. She said she went
to Swayze's office to-day to talk with
him. He had been threatening, she
said, to write to the mother of her
sweetheart and tell her that Miss Al
vcrrd was not the kind of a girl her
son should marry.
Meantime physicians In the build
ing had been summoned to the insur
ance office to attend Miss Alyord. They
found that her wounds are not fatal.
A bullet wound in his nose showed
that he had shot himself. There was
just a breath of life in Swayze's body
when' he was picked up, and he died
while being carried into the Chamber
of Commerce lobby.
LETTER EXPLAINS TRAGEDY.
DETROIT, Mich., June 24.â Charles
Sy.ayze. employed by a life insurance
company and former assistant superin
tendent of th<* Detroit House of Cor
rection, to-day shot Miss Effie Alvord
tnice v.liile the couple were in a pri
vate office of the company's suite on
the eleventh floor of the Chamber of
Commerce, building and tltÂ«n dropped
from the window himself. He was
picked up unconscious and died as he
was being carried into the lobby of
the lmilriincj. Mirs Alvord was shot
in the neck and wrist, but not serious
ly hurt.
Miss Alvord went to the office of the
life insurance company about 11 o'clock
and asked to have a private interview
v.-fth Ewayze. She was shown into a
smal* private office fronting on the
gtate-street Bide of the building, where
Swayze joined her, shutting and lock
ing the door. In a few moments other
persons in the office heard a struggle,
then screams, which were followed in
quick succession by several pistol
shots. Manager McCall of the agency
broke in the door and found Miss Al
vord prostrate on the floor, her hair
disheveled, her waist torn and blood
pouring: from wounds in her neck and
wrist. Through the open window Mc-
Call could see Swayze's hands clutch-
Ing the window ledge. They were In
view for only a moment Then Swayze
let go and his body went whirling
down throuth the air\ It hit several
wires and turned over twice, striking
on the face and chest.

FORESHADOWED THE CHANGE.
The. Jail 'was 'the flrct paper In the
United ' States 'to foreshadow the
changes in the Cabinet now offlclally

is receiving many messages of congrat
ulation such as these:
LOS ANGELES, June 24. â Congratulations
on your appointment to the Cabinet. I salute
the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, i
HARRISON GRAY OTIS.
- In Congress Mr. Metcalf had the dis
tinction of being placed on the House
Ways and Means Committee In his
second term, an honor that marked him
at once as high in the counsels of his
party at the national capital. To his
new post he takes a fine culture, broad
intellect and dignity of personality and
character that have contributed to his
success in the past.
RECEIVES CONGRATULATION.
Politics, did not attract Secretary
elect Metcalf until 1898, when he made
a successful campaign as the Republi
can nominee for Congress 'from the
Third Congressional District. Twice he
succeeded himself in the House of
Representatives, and there Is no doubt
he would this fall have been returned
again had not the distinguished ap
pointment to the President's Cabinet
Intervened.
Repre'sentatlve Victor Hoivard Met
calf, the newly appointed Secretary of
Commerce and Labor, is an attorney
at law, and member of the law firm of
Metcalf & Metcalf of Oakland, the
partner being George D. Metcalfâ of no
kin to the secretary. Mr. Metcalf was
born at Utica, N. T.. October 10, 1853.
He Is a graduate of Yale University,
class of 1876. At college he was fore
most In athletics, particularly aquatics.
After graduation he was admitted to
practice In Connecticut and NewYork,
but came to California In 1879, settling
in Oakland. Two years later the law
firm of Metcalf & Metcalf was formed.
SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGNER.
It also was decided to establish on
the isthmus such postofflces as may be
necessary for the transaction of postal
business of the American zone. Gov
ernor Davis will designate the location
of the offices and. It is understood, will
appoint the postal officials. Orders were
subsequently issued by Secretary Taft
providing for earning out these con
clusions.
WASHINGTON, June 24.âFelicita
tions on his unanimous nomination toy
the Chicago convention were extended
to the President to-day by the members
of his Cabinet assembled for the regu
lar semi-weekly meeting. In addition
to a discussion of the political situa
tion and an exchange of congratula
tions, the President and the Cabinet
considered some important questions.
It was decided that the customs rate
Imposed by the DIngley tariff should be
imposed upon all goods imported Into
the American zone on the isthmus of
Panama, except on such goods as may
be shipped there from the United
States. The American zone is regarded
as United States territory. The en
forcement of the tariff law will be
placed In the hands of Governor Da
vis. He will make such arrangements
with the Treasury Department for the
services of Inspectors in customs mat
ters as he may deem necessary. It Is
expected that little material from for
eign countries will be employed in the
construction of the canal or other pur
poses. Every encouragement will be
given to the importation of such neces
sary products from this country'-

The owners of the various salmon

"The Department of Commerce and
Labor can be of great benefit to this
coast. Our commerce is growing and
I hope to be able to aid in the ad
vancement of the coast in this par
ticular. I feel that there is a great
future for this coast and .1 am sure
that I will be able to help that fu
ture In my new line of work.
"As for the department itself, I will
be able to tell more about It after I
have become more acquainted with its
workings."
'"There is nothing that I could say,"
replied Mr. Metcalf to a question
about his appointment. ' "I fully ap
preciate the honor that has been given
me. I also appreciate the kindly ex
pressions that have reached me â¢ to
day from all sources. But of all the
messages none was more cordial than
that from Mr. Cortelyou himself. Mr.
Cortelyou has offered me his aid in
assuming the work of the department
and that aid will be. immensely valu
able. Mr. Cortelyou took that depart
ment when it was but a mass of
bureaus and he has in one year's time,
arranged them into a harmonious
whole.- I shall go East at once in or

the benefit of his knowledge before he
begins the work of organizing the Re
publican campaign. After that I
shall return to California for a short
APPRECIATE T1IK- HONOIl.
When Mr. Metcalf returns to bis
home after his flying trip of six weeks,
several important events have been
planned for him. There will be a big
banquet to him in San Francisco, which
is being prepared by the Merchants'
Association, Chamberyof Commerce and
other mercantile bodies of that city.
As Mr. Metcalfs department deals
strictly with commerce it Is fitting. that
these bodies should have assumed con
trol of this function. Senator Perkins
has invited the Senators from Oregon
and Washington In order to make it a
Pacific Coast affair.
Among those who congratulated Mr.
Metcalf by wire was Secretary Cortel
you, whom he succeeds in office.' Mr.
Cortelyou offered the new secretary
every aid possible and Mr. Metcalf will
consult with him before he assumes
the control of the national Republican
campaign committee. i i
Mr. Metcalf is not inclined to dis
cuss his new position and modestly
says that he will be able to talk bet
ter about it after he has assumed the
control of the department.
When the telegram came announc
ing that Mr. Metcalf had been appoint
ed to the position telegrams and letters
began to pour in upon him, and before
midnight he had received fully seventy
five messages of- congratulation by
mall or wire. In the afternoon Mr.
Metcalf went to San Francisco and
called upon some of his friends, and
then returned quietly to Oakland, dined
with his family and spent the evening
with his friends at the Athenian Club.
Mr. Metcalf will leave on the limited
train on Monday morning for Washing
ton. He will there confer with Presi
dent Roosevelt and Secretary Cortel
you, whom he succeeds. After a stay
In Washington of about six weeks he
will return to Oakland, wind up his
personal affairs in this city and then
leave to take up the work of his de
partment.

OAKLAND, June 24.â Oakland re
joiced to-day over the appointment of
Victor Metcalf to a Cabinet position,
and this district is doubly proud at
having filled the only two Cabinet po
sitions that ever fell to the lot of Cali
fornia.
the .Cabinet will be tendered to Representative
Victor H. Metcalf. In a recent conversation
with a prominent Callfornian the President
expressed the hope that the leading men ' of
the State would recommend some eminent and
available. Republican for a place In the Cab
inet. The - impression was distinctly conveyed
that a man of the Metcalf type would! be ac
ceptable. There is sure to be under Presi
dent Roosevelt's second administration a new
man for Secretary of the Navy, as Mr. Moody
cannot much longer afford to neglect his Im
portant business affairs to serve the country.
Â» â¢ â¢ â¢ A' suggestion that Senator Perkins'
career as sailor boy. State Senator, Governor of
California and United States Senator might
be brought to a glorious finish as Secretary
of the Navy did not evoke much applause at
the White House. Commendation of Victor H.
Metcalfs public service and special ability
was happily received.

I cannot by this act terminate the close and

more than generous and uniform kindness to
me. and a like word of unfeigned respect and
admiration for the lofty purpose and splendid

WHITE HOUSE. WASHINGTON. June 23.
1904. â My Dear Mr. Knox: I accept your
resignation not "only with keen personal re
gret, but with a very real feeling of the lom
the country thereby sustains. Pf rmlt me to
add that I do not think 1 could have made up
my mind to acquiesce, however reluctantly. In
your leaving your present position had I not
also realized the service you could render In the
Senate. I
There is nothing that I can tfay that will add
to the reputation you have- wen. and no tribute
I can pay you will approach In value that al

respect of your fellow citizens. Tet. from^my
own Information. I wish to bear testimony to
the Invaluable work that you have done. .Dur
ing your i whole time of service you have had
no real holiday. You have never really rested
from your exhausting labor. To your high
professional qualifications you have added un
flagging zeal and an I entire Indifference to
every consideration save the honored Interest
of the people at large. Many great and able
men have preceded you in the office you hold,
tut there Is none among them whose adminis
tration has left a deeper mark upon the coun

literally true that the mightiest and the hum
blest In the land have alike had It brought
home to them that each was subject to the
laws passed and that neither ecu Id hope to

In wtat you hav? done you have giv*n
proof not merely of the profound learning of

cal system In Its relations to the industrial and
economic tendencies of the time.

Attorney General Knox's letter of res
ignation and the President's letter ac
cepting It were dated yesterday. Copies
of the correspondence were made pub
lic to-night. v They follow:
KNOX SENDS LETTER.
Morton took dinner at the Whita
House last evening and the whole sub
ject was considered, after Morton hid
consulted with his personal and busi
ness friends and asosciates. At the
conclusion of the conference Morton
told the President he would accept the
position in the Cabinet. Then it was
tliet the other changes, one of which
at leas' was contingent upon Morton's
action, were decided upon. Â¦
It is expected that further changes
will take place In the Cabinet nex r
winter. Postmaster General Payne
will probably retire from the Cabinet
after the campaign. He will be suc
ceeded by National Chairman Cor
telyou. Secretary Moody will con
tinue as a member of the Cabinet only
to the end of the present administra
tion- on March 4 next, when he will
retire to enter upon the practice of
law in Boston. It is 'quite likely that
other changes will take place In the
event of Roosevelt being elected I*res
:dcnt.
Fe RaHway. Morton Is a personal
friend of the President of many years'
standing. He is a son of the late J.
Sterling Morton of Nebraska, Secretary
of Agriculture in President Cleveland's
last administration. Morton has had
experience In Washington, having been
here with his father.
Since President Roosevelt has been
in the White House he has made more
than one effort to Induce Morton to
accept a position in his administration.
Feeling that his life work in the rail
road world. In which he had ach'eved
success, might be Impaired by h>s ac
ceptance of an official position in the
Government, he uniformly . declined
all such proffers.. In consonance with
this feeling he declined the proffer of
the portfolio of the navy. He was re
quested by the President to reconsider
his declination.
In the meantime King thrust his

POLITICAL PROPHECY.
From away down in Tennessee The
Call receives this mysterious prophecy:
"Ex-Governor Robert K. Pattison of
Pennsylvania w ill be the next President
of the United States. JUN'IUS II.
"As the key to my identity is in the
hands of Ex-President Cleveland, this
card is not anonymous."
Honorable Thomas Rickard: We. your
neighbors and fellow tomTiBinen, ha vine ob
eÂ»-rÂ»-td your career an a faithful and painstak
ing public official, respectfully request that
you allow your name to be ue*d and that you
Â¦Hand a* a candidate to eucceed the Honorable
Victor H. Mrtcair as representative In Con
rrÂ«Â« from the Third Congressional District,
brcby piedring to you our earnest endeavor*
to *ecure. by all honorable means, proper rep
resentation In th* convention to be called by
thÂ«. party, and Â»e believe you entitled to and
that you m-lll receive the unanimous support
of the Herubllcan voters cf Berkelev.
Friends of Thomas Rickard, presi
dent of the Board of Trustees, Berke
ley, want him to get into the race for
the shoes Congressman Victor H. Met
calf will vacate when he goes to
Washington as a mvnber of the Cabi
net- So zealous are they in his be
half that they are circulating a peti
tion requesting his consent to allow his
name to be placed In nomination be
fore the convention. The petition
reads:
THE BOOM FOR RICKARD.
The supporters of State Senator
Lukens" contend that the Congressional
committee should not appoint any of
the delegates, but on the contrary
should ask that the Judgment of Re
publican voters be expressed at pri
mary election in every district. The
Republican nominee, whoever he may
be, will be elected, and as Joseph R.
Knowland, G. R. Lukens and Thomas
Rickard, the three aspirants for nomi
nation, are all men of acknowledged
worth and ability, it is clear that a
capable man will be chosen to repre
sent the district which has been so
fibly and honorably represented by Mr.
Metcalf.
The Third Congressional District
Republican Committee will meet in
Oakland next Monday. The friends
of Mr. Metcalf absolutely control the
committee. The organization has the
power to appoint delegates to the
nominating convention from localities
wherein the provisions of the primary
election law are not mandatory. The
districts outside of the cities of Oak
land, Alameda, Berkeley and Vallejo
are entitled to thirty-five delegates. It
is figured that the Forty-seventh As-
Eembly District, which is the town of
Alameda, will elect nine delegates for
Knowland. Politicians assert that
Knowland's friends, who are identical
Â¦with Metcalfs friends, will be able to
control the convention, as they will
have at the outset forty-four votes, or
only four short of the number required
to nominate.
The Republicans will make an earn
est effort to re-establish the party pres
ttgÂ« In the Second. Fourth and Fifth
Congressional districts. It is practi
cally settled that the Republicans of
the Second District will select Duncan
H McKlnlay of Santa Rosa as their
nominee. In fact the people have al
ready nominated McKinlay and the
convention will simply register the de
mand of the voters. The battle cry in
tee Second will be Roosevelt and Mc-
Klnlay. It is expected that Sacramento
will roll up an oldtime Republican ma
jority for the nominees of the party.
Prospects for Republican success in
the Fifth District are bright. Any good
nominee of the party can carry the
district. A sentiment for fair play sug
gests to many Republicans that the
county of Santa Clara or San Mateo
should be accorded the honor of naming
the candidate.
THIRD DISTRICT.
PAKTT PRESTIGE.
There 1> tsJk In Republican circles to
the effect that City Treasurer J. E.
McDougald ought to be nominated. It
Is said that his popularity with the vot
ers cf the district is so well established
that he would win out against the
strongest man In the Deznocratlo party.
The Republican Congressional Com
mittee of the Fourth District will hold
a session early next week and doubtless
Issue a call for a convention to nom
tsate a candidate for Congress.
The Republican County Committee,
Thomas D. Rlordan chairman, will
meet at 16 Geary etreet next Monday
evening to prepare a petition to partic
ipate in the primary election on Au
gust 8. The petition must be filed with
the Secretary of State forty days prior
to the date of election. At the August
primary delegates to the Santa Cruz
Btate convention and the local nom
inating conventions of the party will
be chosen.
CHICAGO. June 24.â Now for St.
Louis and the excitement of its con
vention. Desolation seems to have
swept this great city, so deserted Is
Michigan avenue and the corridors of
the hotels that face the lake. TfcÂ»
only people that are sorry the conven
tion has swept back Into history arÂ»
th* hotel keepers. But the whole aSair
has been an object lesson to the Call
fornlans and has served to Increase
their respect for tbelr State asd muni
cipal governments. Here thero is no
civic pride. Dirty, unkept streets and
crumbling public buildings that evi
dence corruption arÂ» on every hand.
The City Hall reeks with filth and
totters In decay. Cans and rubbish and
broken bottles fill Its narrow light ways
and courts and the grime of ages
clings to its walls. Californians hops
for something better In St. Louis. If
they fail to find it the pleasure of tha
return home will be a shock almost
too great.
The last party of Californians to see
the sights was headed by Sergeant of
Police Donovan of San Francisco. It
spent an hour or more In the Iroquois
Theater, the scene of the great fire
horror.

The Speaker is not dangerously ! ill.
He had a low fever all convention
week, alternating with chills, and his
physician told him he would have to
pull out of the activities of politics
and the social game and take a com
plete rest. â¢
It is the plan of the Speaker's domes
tic manager to engage passage on the
Cedrlc or one of the other large-, slow
boats and go for a brief trip, which
will be more for the sea voyage than
for foreign travel.
The Republican party managers are
planning to have "Uncle Joe" take an
active part In the coming campaign.
In the fight for Republican Congress
men, which in some districts is to be
bitter, the managers feel Â»(hat "Uncle
Joe" could be used to great effect, and
It has been planned to "star" him.
Unless he can shake off the low fever
which has been dogging him it is felt
by his friends 'and family that he will
not be equal to such strenuous duties.

Mrs. McCloud and her daughters,
whose ages are 12 and 14 years re
spectively, are in sad need of money.
They have been compelled to dispose
of all *their' unnecessary property and
to assist their slender purse by taking
boarders.
McCloud has had a series of busi
ness troubles lately that might sup
port the theory of mental aberration.
His reverses have reduced him from a
man once prosperous to one barely
able to eke out a living. Under the
pressure of these tribulations he be
came troubled in mind and his wife
observed that he manifested this de
cline in various, ways.
. "My husband has acted so strangely
of late that I feared something like
this would happen to him," said Mrs.
McCloud to-day. "I think his business
troubles must' have affected his mind.
He kept saying that he wanted to go
a^way from this neighborhood. Once
he talked of going to Mexico and may
be he has done so.
"Mr. McCloud was compelled to
turn over his business to his partner
some time ago when reverses came
upon him. But he engaged in busi
ness again with Ernest Niehaus and
seemed* to be getting along well until
a week or so before he disappeared.
Then he began to talk queerly. From
that time until he disappeared he did
not seem to be the same man.' I can
not helr> but fear that he has been
foully dealt with or wandered away
somewhere." Â¦ '
Alexander McCloud of the firm of
McCloud & Niehaus, San Francisco,
building contractors, has disappeared
from his home at Cedar street and
Shattuck avenue, leaving a family of
three suffering in destitution. Since
Saturday last ' McCloud^ has been
among the vast army of the missing.
His anxious and careworn wife still
believes him innocent of any design to
set her adrift and prays for his re
turn while she sells the household fur
niture to buy food for herself and two
young girls. She holds to, the belief
that he is either a victim of foul play
or of dementia.

BERKELEY, June 24.â Finely planned
architecture will make the new Califor
nia Hall one of the handsomest among
the family of structures on the campus
at the University of California. John
Galen Howard, the architect, has con
trived a building after the Italian re
naissanceâornate, stately and withal
strikingly picturesque. In drawing his
plans Mr. Howard has provided for
something that will seem distinctly Cal
ifornian â the tiled roof, so closely con
nected with the architectural history of
the State since its beginning with the
Spanish missions. The architect has
shaped this work of art, too, so that it
will conform to the plans for the great
er university and provide a structure
as practical and substantial as it .will
be beautiful.
Steel and stone are to be cut and
welded into shape in the making of this
building.. The work has already begun
and will go on until next January, by
which time the contractors hope to give
the university the completed California
Hall. There will be a basement and
two stories to the structure and its
foundations will cover an area 200 by 70
feet. Â¦ .. â¢

In order to confirm his belief that
the fossil remains of a great- lizard
like animal found in the limestone beds
of Idaho a year ago is of an entirely
new kind. Professor John C. Merriam
of the paleontology department of
the University of California has gone
to Europe to study the types of the
same order of animal in the museums
there. A report to President Wheeler
published at the university outlines the
plans Professor Merriam will pursue
in his researches to discover the an
cestry of this strange animal.
Professor Merriam is going to Eu
rope particularly to look into the his
tory of the animal. This gives some
idea of its importance to paleontologi
cal science. It is undoubtedly^ one of
a new series of prehistoric animals
that roamed the earth ages ago and
long before the surface became settled
into its present land and water divi
sions. It is a marine type, and the
discovery of its remains in Idaho is
proof that the seas washed the land
of that State millions of years ago, be
fore volcanic eruptions changed the
character of the whole country.
If the animal lived in these days it
would be called a sea lizard. Its scien
tific name is thallattosauris. It differs
but slightly from the ichthyosaurus,
which Is another of the marino type
of the prehistoric animal, resembling
the fish lizard. And while it is difficult
for any but scientists to distinguish
between the two, there is really a great
difference that is important to science
and that is why Professor Merriam is
taking such pains to study the history
of its companions of a million, years
ago now lying under glass cases in
European museums.
Professor Merriam will publish a bul
letin descriptive of this animal upon
his return from Europe. -k,'

In. presenting this Greek classic the
university is following up the prece
dent set last year, when "The Birds"
of Aristophanes was given at the dedi
cation of the Greek Theater. It is the
plan to give at least one of these an
cient Gramas each year in the Greek
Theater with the students themselves
in all the roles.
The university public will be regaled
with still another dramatic diversion
later in the year, probably in October.
This will be the presentation of Soph
ocles' "Ajax" by the students of the
Greek department. The students will
be prepared for this by Miss Mabel
Hay Barrows, who gave valuable as
sistance when the same play was
staged in New York in March last. The
costiimes used in the New York* play
will be shipped here for the Califor
nia production.
Ben Greet find his company of Kng
lish players are coming to the Univer
sity nf California again this year. Be
fore he left the coast last year, after
presenting "I'veryman" and "Twelfth
Night," Greet said he would return,
end now it it dennitely announced that
he will fulfill his promise. Those two
classics were so uniquely and ar
tistically staged that people of culture
were profoundly impressed with them
and wished for the reappearance of
the company, which is at last assured
after many anxious months.
Greet's company will present "Ham
let" in the Greek open air theater on
the afternoon of September 24. As in
"Twelfth Night." the play will be with
out intermissions, the immensity of
the stage allowing for a continuous
performance. The company will be
practically the same as last year, ex
cept that Miss Matthison, whose pow
ers have been so enthusiastically recog
nized in the East, will be the leading
lady in thi place of Mrs. Itawdon Caw
ley. The details for this dramatic treat
are being arranged by the dramatic
committee, of which Professor William
D. Armes. J. B. Landfield and Lincoln
Hutchinson are the members.

Alfred Mitchler, the brother, went to
yve at the Martin home with his sis
ter, but did not meet his mother and
father until their return from Eu
rope.
Mrs. Sperry was in England when
the marriage took place. As Captain
and Mrs. Martin left almost immedi
ately for Europe she met them at Liv
erpool very shortly afterward. When
it. came to fixing the dates, however,
recollection only served and the Judge
held that" tfre. meeting" occurred" "three
days too late to come within the time
limit. ;
Miss Marie L. Mitchler. a sister of
the losing litigants, who inherited $20,
000, was recognized as a stepdaughter
for more than ten years, so she es
capes the tax of $1000 that would other
wise be due in her case. Captain Mar
tin and the mother of the children had
been married just ten years and one
month at the time of his death. Judge
Greene held that recognition. and mar
riage were not synonymous in this
sense and it immediately threw the
question open to the exact. date when
each child had been "recognized" as
such by Martin.
Miss Marie L. Mitchler was at home
with her mother at the time of the
marriage. Her time began to count
from the first day and was exempt
from taxation.
Mrs. Sperry inherited $10,000 and her
brother inherited $5000 from their step
father. On these inheritances the
State will now collect 5 per cent. Mrs.
Sperry was just three' days tardy in
getting within the ten year clause of
the law. The act exempts inheritances
from taxation In cases where step
children have been recognized as such
for a decennium.
If Mrs. Catherine M. Sperry had been
the recognized stepdaughter of the late
Captain Daniel E. Martin for ten full
years preceding his death she would
.not have been required to-day to pay
$500 inheritance taxes. Her brother,
Alfred G. Mitchler, will be compelled
to pay J250 because of the same law.
There is a tide in the affairs of step
children that leads to the saving of
money if seized at the floodâ and Judge
Greene has just rendered a decision
that illustrates the fact.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

. Brainerd C. Brown of Alameda was
not in favor of consolidation, for it
meant to be swallowed up in a gov
ernment which lie said was notorious
ly corrupt. :.' [..'y
"Some one," he declared, "had re
marked that 'Every people has a gov
ernment as good as it deserves."
When the rank and file do not care
and take no interest they can expect
just what they get. We of Alameda
would sooner pay a little more and
keep our schools and our streets un
der our own control than be taken into
a government where we would have
little or nothing to say as to what
should be done with our money. When
Oak lurid can come" to us with clean
hands we shall be ready to join with
her. I believe what Mayor Olney has
suid and I think that he stands for all
that is good and pure in government,
and if city and county affairs could be
run as he wishes to have .them I
mould not fear to join with him."
â¢The three cities of Alameda, Berke
\ey and Oakland contributed $121,000
last year for money expended where
they got only an indirect benefit from
it. Besides this we give our cities a
bad name for having a high tax ra.te.
Our tftxes in this city amount to within
a fraction of 2VÂ» per cent and you can
only Ret 3'Â± per cent for the money you
have on deposit in the bank."
Attorney Snook followed in much
the same strain. He thought the key
note of the situation had beÂ«n struck
in the proposal to consolidate the city
governments of Alameda, Berkeley
and Oakland. Three city governments
were kept going where one was
needed. He defended to some extent
the money expended by the cities for
th* improvements of the roads within
The counties, as he believed that they
derived some benefit from them.
OPPOSES CONSOLIDATION".
Mayor Olney declared that he in-
U-'ised Professor Insktep's position
thoroughly, and then, taking up that
part of it relating to the amount of
duplicate work done by different city
governments and the amount of money
to us spent, said:
"Possibly some of you know that I
am a crank upon this subject of con
solidation. I believe in it. If there are
thuse here to-night who oppose con
solidation I will tell you now that you
rr.ay as well get out of the way, for it
is bound to come. There Is too much
waste of money and so much unneces
sary work that economy will not put
up with.

>-EWS OF DANGER TO WIFE
DRIVES GERMAN TO SUICIDE
An affidavit of Katherine McLaugh
lln, sister of Margaret McLaughlin,
who is suing John F. Whelan for the
recovery of $7000, said to have been
given him for safe keeping, was the
pointed feature yesterday of a hearing
in Judge Seawell's court. The Judge
was considering Whelan's demurrer to
the complaint and his motion to dis
solve the restraining order preventing
him from disposing of his assets.
Both of the McLaughlin women
were in court and heard their attorney
give Judge Seawell a direct admission
as to the manner in, which the money
was earned that Margaret is said to
ha,ve deposited with Whelan. Kath
erine's affidavit related that she was a
sister of the plaintiff and lived at 246
O'Farrell street. She alleged that her
sister and Whelan lived together at
319 Sutter street for a year and a half
and down to within a short time be
fore the institution of the pending pro
ceedings. She had frequently visited
her sister and held conversations with
Whelan concerning the moneys re
ceived from Margaret. He admitted,
she says, that her sister gave him
her dally earnings, amounting to more
than $7000. Katherine saya that she,
too', 'at his earnest solicitation, turned
over her own earnings to him for safe
keeping and at one time he had $600
belonging to her.
Judge Seawell took the motions of
the defendant under submission.

so and Joy thought no more of the
matter till a few minutes later, when
he reported off duty. He was sur
prised to find blood on the left sleeve
of his coat and more so when he saw
a deep cut on his left arm. One of
the gang had made a thrust apparent
ly at Joy's left sMe with a knife and
he had received it on his arm. He
will not report for duty for some days.

Alnmeda Sails To-Day.
NEW YORK, June 24.â Bradstreefs
to-morrow will say: . ..
There has been some enlargement in
demand at the West this week, but the
betterment . as yet . is largely one of
tone. Reports from the leading in
dustries are not significant of any par
ticular reaction from the dullness noted
heretofore.
The iron trade appears to be ground
ing upon the bottom as regards prices
and curtailment la becoming wlde
spread. ' From the leading textile in
dustries the story Is one of almost mid
summer dullness and of a waiting dis
position on the part of the manufac
turers. Railway .. earnings for the
elapsed portion of June promise to
make rather more fayora*ble compari
sons that the early .spring, months,
while bank clearings betray irregular
ity, coincident with varying influences
affecting bank operations at different
centers, and are below last week and
Jast year. No particular improvement
in collections is yet; to b^ seen and a
long spell of warm weather is still re
garded- as necessary'' if retail trade is
to be stimulated. '- < \
Wheat, including flour, exports for
the week ending June 23 aggregate
1,271,437 bushels, against 2,444,251 last
week, 3,158,152 this week last year and
3,382,701 in 1902. From July. 1, 1903, to
date they aggregate 132,72*7,439 bushels,
against 220,199,691 last season and 244,
143,258 in 1902.
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending June 23 number
185, against 181 last- week and 171 last
year. In Canada failures for the week
number 23, against 18 last week and 18
in this week a year ago.
NEW YORK," June 24.â R. G. Dun
& Company's Weekly Review of Trade
to-morrow will say:
Aside from the strike of garment
workers, developments of the last week
have tended to strengthen confidence.
One political convention' has ended and,
although its action was a foregone con
clusion, the Industrial atmosphere is
slightly clearer.. The fiscal' year is
drawing to a close with national fin
ances In a sound condition, the small
shrinkage In Federal customs receipts
being no cause for uneasiness. The
most important -trade' Â¦ Influence Just
now is the progress of the crops and
the past week has brought no setback.
Seasonable weather has stimulated dis
tribution of merchandise and retail
business Is improving very noticeably
at many cities, although it is not cus
tomary to find sales Increasing at this
time. Railway earnings thus far for
June are surprisingly satisfactory, an
increase over last year of 4.2 per cent
being reported.
"Western hide markets have ruled
very dull. Packers hold for full prices,
but the tanners buy little, as recent
declines in leather depressed that mar
ket below a parity with hides.
Failures this week numbered 227 in
the United States, agalnsf 223 last year,
and 32 in Canada, compared with 19 a
year ago.
It is alleged that the treasurer of
this county has not at any time adver
tised ,for the. surrender or redemption
of the Montgomery-avenue bonds. Fur
thermore, it is said that the last time
the city and county of San Francisco
levied an assessment to pay the prin
cipal or interest on these bonds was in
1880-81. From April 26, 1S83, to Jan
uary 31, 1891, 95 cents was the only
amount in the coupon fund and this
was then transferred to the general
fund. On June 30, 13S2, it is alleged,
the Montgomery&venue sinking fund
amounted to $12,318 20 and this was
converted into the genera* fund on July
31, 1891. Since then there has been
nothing in the fund to pay either prin
cipal or Interest.
The complaint filed yesterday goes
over the official actions In regard to the
extension of Montgomery avenue in
1872, diagonally through nineteen
blocks of thickly settled land, from
Washington street to Beach and Leav
enworth. An act of the nineteenth
Legislature authorized the extension
and at the same time, it Is alleged,
created the Board of Works, consisting
of the Mayor, Tax Collector and Sur
veyor of this city and county as agent
of the State. William Alvord was
Mayor in that year.
It is recited that after all of the pro
visions of the Legislature were complied
with in regard to opening the avenue
bonds were ordered issued in payment
of damages to property and to secure
deeds to the land utilized. It is alleged
that all of these damages and deeds
were paid for out of the money re
ceived from the sales of bonds which
were disposed of at thirty-six different
sales to some sixty-nine different buy
ers at prices ranging from 85 cents to
88% cents on the dollar par. The com
plaining company, prior to the rejec
tion of its claim by the State Board of
Examiners, became the bona fide own
er of 855 bonds out of the 1579 origi
nally issued.
NO MOXEY IX FUND.
The Union Trust Company prpposes
to revive the official history of San
Francisco for thirty-two years past in
support of its contention that the
State of California should pay $855,000
and more than 51,000,000 interest there
on, for the building of Montgomery
avenue, in the halcyon days of 1872.
The complaint of the trust company
was filed yesterday morning in the Su
perior Court. It was a long, printed
document of numerous pages and mul
tifarious allegations. At its conclusion
there was a prayer of the plaintiffs for
Judgment against the State for the par
value of 855 bonds of $1000 each, Issued
for the extension of the street, together
with interest thereon up to. date of ma
turity,' January 1, 1903, amounting to
$1,121,010, and interest accrued on the
total from maturity until the date of
Judgment in the suit now Instituted.
The Union Trust Company, after se
curing ownership of the bonds, laid a
ground for its case against the State
by applying for payment from the City
and County Treasurer and presenting
its claim to the State Board of Exam
iners. In both -instances the trust com
pany was turned down.
OLD HISTORY REVIEWED!
The Holliswood is consigned to Hind,
Rolph &. Co. of San Francisco and is
owned by Stephen H. Mills of New-
York. She has a cargo of 1400 tons of
coal. Captain Knight to-day tele
graphed his consignees for orders, and
It is probable that the crippled bark
will be towed to San Francisco by one
of the steam schooners calling at this
port. ,
"Mrs. Knight was well on the voyage,
but the babv has been sick a great
deal. My wife refused to leave the
Holliswood when requested to do so by
the Prussia and the Transit or the
steamer Asuncion, which we spoke
yesterday off Redondo. All the mem
bers of the crew, while tired out, have
been well."
"Cn May 2$ w e met the bark Prussia,
bound from San Francisco for Puget
Bound. At this time we were complete
ly out of provisions and our case was
beginning to look hopeless. The Prus
e:a gave us what provisions Ehe could
El are from her larder and we proceeded
on our course for San Francisco. We
Bailed a couple of days when a heavy
northwest gale struck the Holliswood
and drove her far off her course. In
her crippled condition we could make
but poor progress against the adverse
winds and currents, and when the pro
visions furnished us by the Prussia
were nearly exhausted we spoke the
t chooner Transit, bound from Portland
for San Francisco with a lumber cargo.
This was on June 2, and we were then
about '150 miles southwest of San Fran
c!fco. The schooner gave us provisions
and we again attempted to make the
port of San Francisco. Last Saturday,
June IS, we struck an unusually severe
ctorm, and the foretopsail of the Hol
liswood was blown away. I then de
cided to run before the wind and make
the port of San Pedro.
"Just three weeks ago we were only
three cr four miles off the Farallon Isl
ands, but could not get in and could
not Eight a tug or steamer. After we
v ere out a few days we found a stow
away, Dan Rooney, a young man about
CO years of age, whose parents live in
Pennsylvania. He was one of the most
faithful members of the crew during
all the long voyage.
The Hclliswood is a.n American bark,
commanded by Captain G. B. Knight,
and has a crew of fourteen men. In
addition to the crew the wife and eight
roonths-old baby accompanied the cap
tain on the voyage. The Holliswood
left Newcastle on Washington's birth
day, and the story of the trip across
the Pacific was most eventful. Captain
Knight made the following statement
til the voyage:
"We left Newcastle on February 22,
and had been out but two days when
we met with high seas and heavy head
winds. One 6torm followed another in
constant succttsion. We lost our top
eails and the bottom of the Holliswood
became very foul. The vessel '.'.as also
leaking badly on the voyage. We sailed
ft greater portion of the time with jury
rigged sails, but on account of the foul
condition of the ship we were able to
znake but slow progress.
SAN PEDRO. June =Â«.â The crippled
tnd overdue American bark Hollis
Â¦wood, out 122 days from Newcastle,
New South 'Wales, for San Francisco,
crept into this port at 7 o'clock this
xncrnlng. She brings a harrowing tale
of hardships. Her sails are badly rent
by the gales, her foretopmast is gone
Â«.r.d she Is in a leaking condition.

Mastered by His Own Traps.
A very striking proof of the Czar's
bondage was recently afforded when
the Czar dispatched one of his per
sonal favorites, a "certain M. Klopoff,
into the central provinces of Russia
to report on the true condition of af
fairs there, about which he had pre
viously received official Information.
He 'desired to test the accuracy of
bureaucratic reports, but he knew that
letters from M. Klopoff direct to him
would Inevitably be opened and sup
pressed If they contained statements
of which officialdom disapproved. In
order to avoid this espionage he or
dered. M. Klopoff to mail his reports
in small envelopes of the pattern used
for private letters, not straight to the
palace, but to the address in St. Pe
tersburg of a certain General Hesse.
General Hesse was Intrusted with the
secret and "he, undertook personally to
carry all the letters received from M.
Klopoff to the, Czar. M. Klopoff went

Certifying Their Worth.
Every one knows that Mexican sil
ver, dollars circulate in the Far East,
especially in China. But it seems the
Mexican minting is not enough of a
certificate of. character. A peso that
has long been in circulation in China
is covered with Chinese characters.
The bankers, of whom there are hun
dreds in China/ jvhb receive" Mexican
dollars affix to. them their seals to
guarantee their legitimacy, and, as
pesos circulate and go from one bank
to another they are being marked by
all banks which receive them. In case
the peso proves to- be illegal the
banker who sealed it Â¦ last has to
change it, for good money and with
draw it from circulation. When the
pesos are; completely, covered with
seals they are sent back to Mexico to
be recoined, the expense being paid by
all the bankers: whose seals 'are seen
on the coin. It is in accordance with a
recent agreement. But it often hap
pens that dollars, although marked all
over their two faces, continue in cir
culation and are highly esteemed, aa
the seals are so many guarantees that
they are genuine. The decision to seal
pesos was taken because illegal .coins
began to circulate in China.â New

ALREADY the intermittent popping of firecrackers
from street corners and the explosion of caps
under street car wheels denote the near presence
of the Fourth of July. With the approach of that day of
celebration doctors begin to lay out their lint and anti
septics, nurses put the emergency wards of hospitals into
order and the anxious householder hurries to take out
the belated insurance on his worldly goods. While
prators are preparing their panegyrics upon the spirit of
liberty and poets are conning their meters for a won
drous trochaic outburst of poesy it is not amiss to take
a little sober counsel with ourselves upon the subject of
a more sane celebration of the nation's birth.
There are some hard facts to intrude themselves upon
our attention. The Journal of the American Medical
Association in a reprint of a recent article presents them
with all true medical dryness. As a result of the noisy
festivities attending the celebration of the last Fourth
there were 466 lives lost, 10 persons made blind for life
and 3973 others injured more or less seriously. Accord
ing' to the table published by, the Journal our own State
contributed its record of 3 deaths and 97 injuries to the
grim total. In nearly every instance of death the
agonies of the sufferer were those of tetanus or lockjaw
and were from two to thirty hours in duration.
When we consider that in none of the battles- of the
Spanish war did our country lose 400 men in one day's
fighting this grim. roster of sacrifice, made in honor, of
the nation's birth and repeated from year to year, has
about it a shadow npthing else but; appalling. Does it
bring anything to the dignity of our day of freedom
that there should be the torn and burned bodies of 4000
children to attest to our. high sense of patriotism; or
does it add a whit to our sense of national intelligence
that we should yearly indulge in the dangerous burning
of much powder and chemicals? These are questions
which force our attention. â¢ .
Of course a noiseless Fourth would be to the small
boy nothing short of a high crime and -treason against
A GLORIOUS FOURTH AND TETANUS.

THE Chicago convention has gone into history and
the comments oi observers of its sessions are
written! One remark is generally made, and
truthfully. The; passion that rivalry in leadership has
put into other great conventicles of the party was
absent from this. Â¦
In 1856 the party was too young and small to have
much interest in anything except its declaration of
principles. Hut in i860 the rivalry between Lincoln and
Seward gave zest to the convention. Later on the feud
of Conkling and Blaine enlivened conventions as long
as both lived. But the party has reached an age now
and achieved a record which seem to warrant only one
form of competition. between its leaders, and that is a
rivalry of effort to do the most for party success, im
pressed that it means the welfare of the country.
This last convention has furnished literature with the
highest expressions that" have ever issued from a party
gathering. The speeches were of a high order and make
the record for convention oratory. Mr. Root's opening
speech, Governor Black's presentation of President
Roosevelt, and the seconding speeches, were all of a
very high order and will bear more than one reading.
Speaker Cannon's address on taking the chair was un
studied and will stand as a good example of campaign
speaking. Mr. Knight sustained, his reputation in his
seconding speech for California, and quite surprised his
friends and admirers by the original coinage of some
very fetching phrases.
The convention passed without any appearance of the
less noble passions of rival ambitions, but was rich in
expressions of the more noble passion of patriotism and
regard for the rights of man.
German military life to prove that the
pen is mightier than the Eword than
any author of his generation. Two years
ago an obscure tyro, to-day finds him
famous; and the dominant literary figure
cf the hour in Germany. Two worksâ
â¢ novel and a playâ have won -him rep
utation and fortune, the romance,
"Jena or Sedan.", and the^ stirring
drama" of German barrack life,' "Zap-
Xenstreich." Both portray in strikingly
vivid form the modern afpects of Ger
man militarism, "which is set forth in
â¢uch naked reality that the. public con
science of all Germany' has been
aroused as it has never been aroused
before t<^ the evils of the grinding sys
tem and ail its attendant bitternesses
*nd hardships. "Jena or Sedan" has
broken all German records for . Bates,
More than 200.000 copies | have been
printed and sold, a figure iw?ver before
approached in the history of the Ger
man book trade. Everybody who reads
at all has read it. The Kaiser is said
to have thumbed it through three
times. Army officers have made it the
subject of passionate debate in private
and public, and the Reichstag has rung
with angry quotations from its pages
by members of the Social Democratic
party, who find it unrivaled material
for their incessant attacks on the Gov
ernment's military policy.
Beyerlein is a native of a little manu
facturing town in Saxony renowned for
the production of Meissen pottery. As
a young man of 21 years he served his
year with the colors as an artilleryman
at the garrison of Plrna. near Dresden,
where his shrewd powers of observa
tion and retentive memory supplied him
with the material with which he was
destined later to win literary renown.
The garrison of Pirna. under Another
name, is the place at which the scenes
in "Jena or Sedan" are supposed to
have occurred.
The Interrogatory title of the book
vat chosen by . Beyerlein to Indicate
that Germany must choose between an
other "Jena"â the great tattle at which
the Prussians were crushed by Napo
leonâand another "Redan"â the fight in
uhich they worsted th? French in 1S70
~4f the Fatherland is Jo remain an in
vulnerable military power. His conclu
tJons, of couÂ«re, are that the country
it headed for another Jena unless the
abuses which he depicts are radically
arrested. Howls of /protest, taunts of
"traitor" ajid "Social Democrat" greet
ed Beyerlein.; when' "Jena or Sedan"
first appeared. He /was accused of ma
licious exaggeration of army abuses
and of striving for a . sensation, '/but
people took him/so seriously. .that* the
army authorities 1 ' themselves were final
ly stirred and ( in â¢; response : to : public
% t-ntlment, which immediately began to
crystallize, "they ' were forced to order

tfcarga Bfyerlein" had 'made,/ namely,
Beyerlein'p friends resent the impu
tation that he lent himself to revolu
tionary uses in writing "Jena or Se
dan." They assert he proved his pa
triotism by calling attention to the
evils of the army system and point to
the revelations and reforms the pub
lication has precipitated as proof of
the good work he has accomplished.
Last winter Beyerlein added to his
fame by writing the military play,
"Zapfenstreich." As "Jena or Se
dan" emphasizes one evil of army life,
brutality to soldiers, "Zapfenstreich"
moralizes on the deadly caste distinc
tion which respect for the officer class
breeds in the German people. *A
Charming love story, with a tragic
ending, throws the veil of romance
around a story which is in reality a
merciless attack on militarism, the
very bone and sinew of German life.
"The Crown Prince attended the open
ing performance of "Zapfenstreich"
at the Lesfing Theater in Berlin and
was severely reprimanded by the Kai
ser for doing so. At many garrison
cities the military authorities have
forbidden either officers or men to at
tend the play, which is. now being pro
duced everywhere and arouses tre
mendous enthusiasm.
' Beyerlein's best days are before him
and 4 admirers of his bold style predict
a still more brilliant career for the
young author who has chosen the
most vital theme of German life as a
vehicle for his talents. A

rsÂ» to traitors it will have to be definite
as to names, time and place.
The annual report of the Boys'* and Girls' Aid Society
speaks volumes for the splendid work being done for
homeless and helpless boys by this institution. Waifs are
sent out to work on the farm and in the orchard to learn
the vital lesson of self-reliance in life. They arc paid for
their labor and taught the value of money honestly
earned. No better or nobler purpose inspires public
spirited citizens in California.
Russian Bravery.
Here is a story of Russian bravery.
There is a monument in Turkestan to
Beveral Russian soldiers captured by
the Turcomans in 1879. They were
artillerymen, and their guns were cap
tured with them; so the Turcomans
naturally ordered them, on penalty of
death, to serve those guns- against
their own comrades. Every man re
fused, choosing death by horrible tor
ture and dying without a murmur.
This passion for self-sacrifice is the
keynote of the Russian character and
is cultivated in the army by every pos
sible means. The recruit is invariably
told the story of that heroic company
of infantrymen in the Lomakin expedi
tion into Turkestan, who, at a critical
moment, threw themselves into a deep
ditch in order that the guns, which
were sorely needed at the front, might
be galloped over their bodies. It is
doubtful whether this could have hap
pened in any army but the Russian.
If there is one thing in which the
Russian army excels it is marching.
Lord Roberts' famous march to Can
dahar has been equaled over and over
again by the Czar's troops in their
Central Asian campaigns. When Gen
eral Kuropatkln marched a force of
Turkestan troops to join Skobeleff in
the attack on Geok Tepe, he and his
men were swallowed up in an un
known, trackless desert for twenty-six
days, yet they covered over forty miles
a day and marched in at the end of
the timÂ£ in perfect military order
without a single man sick or fallen
out. It was a wonderful feat, but it
was not regarded In Russian military
circles, as being anything extraordi
nary'-
A former captain of the Russian
army told me of a friend of his who
lived foi\years in a small town and
was then ordered away to St. Peters
burg. In less than six months he re
ceived a command to return and
promptly blew out his brains.
"Nobody was . surprised," said my
friend. "We all knew what life in
such places is like. A man can be
happy in Siberia on a lonely outpost
where he has no companions of his
own rank within a hundred miles, but
there is no happiness possible in a
small Russian garrison town for a
man of average â¢ intelligence." â The

"Not much, Judge," said the young

Phantom Isles.
Among the red dots on the map de
noting the empire upon .jvhich the sun
never sets is a group of islands to the
south of Australia, bearing the name
of the Royal Company Islands. These
have hitherto appeared on the British
admiralty charts as a group of four
or five specks, the exact position being
latitude 50.20 south, longitude 143.0 east.
In atlases they have the red line be
neath them, which is usually taken to
mean that the British flag has been
hoisted there. Now the admiralty has
issued a "notice to mariners," headed
"Royal Company Islandsânon-exist
ence of." The original report of their
discovery cannot be traced, nor have
they apparently been seen by passing
vessels. However, on dark nights ves
sels sailing in their supposed neigh
borhood have set a course to clear
them and the lookout has watched for
"breakers ahead." Certain matters
have come to the notice of the admiral
ty which has led it to expunge the is
lands from the charts, the most con
vincing: testimony being that of the
captain of the Matatua, which passed
right over . their alleged position" In
1900i Thus it is that the copper chart
plates on which the Islands are en
graved will be filed and burnished at
the spot where the ghostly natives of
the phantom Royal Company Islands
once enjoyed the privilege of being
under British protection.
TO-MORROW the Sunday Call will publish the third
of the four installments of "The Fugitive," the
powerful novel of Ezra S. Brudno, which, since it
came from the publishers three months ago, has at
tracted wide and critical attention throughout Europe
and America. The front page illustration will be a life
size sketch of Joaquin Miller,, "The Poet of the Sierras,"
drawn from life by A..J. Cahill, accompanied by a brief
record of the poet's earlier life.
In addition there will be a full page drawing by Her
man W. Hansen, the first in a series which will be con
tinued from time to time, selected to portray the .true
characteristics and the picturesque life of the California
Indian and the California vaquero. The series will be
especially valuable as preserving pictures of two phases
of the present day, but especially of earlier California
life, which are inevitably destined, with the passing of
time, to become but a remembrance.
Two short stories that claim full page prominence,
with appropriate illustrations are "The King Inter
venes,"' by Robert Barr, and "The Sky-Scraper," by
Frank H. Spearman, one as stirring a Scottish romance as
Rarr has ever written and the other one of the very finest
of Spearman's famous railroad stories. Under "Timely
Topics of the. World" is told the remarkable story of
the richest girl in the world, Miss Krupp, who holds the
fate of nations in her hand. "Stronger Than Hate," a
terse, powerful story by Frank H. Sweet, claims the
place of honor upon the storiette page, which also con
tains lively and interesting short stories by E: Sargent,
Sidney H. Cole and Kate M. Cleary. On the woman's
page Madge Moore tells of "The Dower Chest Girl"
and answers timely and pertinent queries. Jerome K.
Jerome adds to his regular series an amusing skit en
titled "Sport Stricken Mortals"; Kate Thyson Marr con
tributes a half page of pithy comment in her "Meows of
a Kitty,'' to which Bronstrup adds some affecting mar
ginal" decorations; the puzzle page as usual announces
prize winners and furnishes material for another week's
guessing. and a catchy bit of music will be found upon

THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
on his mission, but out of eighteen
letters which he posted to General Â¦
Hesse for the Czar only five reached
their destination. A strong ruler
would doubtless make a vigorous ef-'
fort to liberate himself from this tyr
anny, but the Czar is essentially a
weak man. The unhealthy, pale, al
most gray color of his complexion be
trays his want of physical health and
strength, while the amazing inconsist
encies of his reign indicate successive
surrenders to conflicting influences. It
is characteristic of his weakness that
he never 3trikes out a new line of
thought of action on his own initia
tive and that his decision on any giv
en question of policy is nothing more
than the choice which of two or more
courses recommended to him by dif
ferent advisers shall be followed. He
is never a leader like the German Em
peror, but is continually being led by
some influential man or group of men.

Department the prize in gunnery, and once more dis

maudlin sentiment would have retired a* few months

He was a ragged little urchin, in
dependent, but not "fresh." He was
also manly and for this reason the
probation officers of the Juvenile
Court, in whose custody he was. took
a fancy to him. They spoke of the
little fellow to Judge Murasky and
when the Judge paid his usual dally
visit to the quarters set aside for
Juvenile offenders he called the boy
to him.
"Well, son," said the Judge, "what's
your name, and where do you live?"
"Martin, sir," responded the boy,
"and I live any old place."
"Have you no parents or home?"
"Nope," said the boy. "I just 'butt*

week. Too many 'lungers* dere, so I
pulled me freight for Frisco. Gee, but

that abuse of recruited men was com
mon and widespread among the Kais
er's troops. Court-martial after court
martial revealed the truth of the au
thor's charges. Dozens of brutal ser
geants were tried and sentenced for
brutality in barracks. One non-com
missioned rufflari was convicted of over
3000 individual cases of maltreatment
ol men. Such revelations naturally
caused an upheaval of popular resent
ment, for. the best families in Germany
under the inexorable conscription sys
tem send their sons Into the army, and
the toleration of such practices was
branded as barbaric.
The authorities found themselves
pompelled to withstand an avalanche
of criticism from every quarter and
the stamping out of brutality in. the
army has become within the last year
the subject to engross the closest at
tention of the Kaiser's commanding
officers. His Majesty himself has, of
course, felt the weight of public opin
ion and has expressed himself forcibly
upon the necessity for treating en
listed men humanely.
THE Republican National Convention has finished
its work, named the candidates and appointed the
men .who are to manage -the coming campaign.
The nomination of President Roosevelt has been assured
from the moment he took the great oath over the still,
white face of his fallen predecessor. His administration
has faced many emergencies. Many responsibilities,
unseen and not anticipated, .have, appeared, and he has
met them with calmness, courage and patriotism.
One trait in him has not received due credit because
of the violence of partisan denunciation that has fallen
upon him. He has probably been the most unpartisan
of all our Presidents. While adhering strictly to the
principles and policy of his party, he has fellowshipped
all of his countrymen, of all kinds and conditions, with
a truly American sense of equality. In making appoint
ments and promoting men to positions of prominence
before the country he has not considered only the claims
of his own partisans. This was shown in appointing the
Panama -Canal Commissioners, the most important body
of men now in the public service of any country, on
earth. His selection was dictated by the character of
the men entirely, and we doubt if a dozen persons in
"the country know to what party, any one of the Com
missioners belongs.
He has not treated his political opponents as outlaws
from interest and participation in the Government, but
has been respectful of their fights as his equal fellow
citizens. He does not require that, men be his disciples,
as some Presidents have. He expects criticism of his
public acts, but, with the proper spirit of a gentleman,
resents it when it becomes personal. Â¦ Many men in the
minority have been offensive in their personal- attacks
upon him, mistaking misrepresentation, and derision for
proper criticism of the policies which he represents.
Such do not command his confidence nor have they the
right to expect it. v -
The great body of the people, regardless of party,
have confidence in his honor, integrity, -patriotism,
energy and ability, and feel that the great interests of
the country are safe in his hands and keeping. He is
the most outspoken and frank of men. In the crowds
that visit the executive offices no man finds him whis
pering with people. His decisions are prompt and his
promises are kept. Ho has high ideals. and promotes
them in others. No sinister or covert man feels easy
in his presence, and therefore but. few such are found
in his following. His public addresses would, furnish
a volume of maxims, epigrams and proverbs on personal
decency,' domestic virtue, patriotism and public honesty.
In expression he is original and forcible.
His well cultivated talents equip him for the Presi
dency in many ways. He is the first President able to
speak with ease many languages besides his own. In
whatever company he may be he is an interesting figure
and would be so independently of the office he holds.-
His manly opponents, who are not made strabisrnatic
by prejudice, concede that he is a product of our institu
tions of whom all Americans can be proud, whether
they agree with his* political views or not
Senator* Fairbanks, the second on the ticket, has be
come known to the whole country since he entered the
Senate. Reared on an Ohio farm, there were many ties
between him' and President McKinley. He is. a man
of fine ability and high purpose. When Morton and
the old school of the Republican party in Ohio passed
away there was a call for younger men to go put against
the Democratic strength that had developed there under
the teachings of Michael C. Kerr, Hendricks, Voorhees,
Turpic and MacDonald. The State has always been an
interesting political battleground. When it held its
State election in October in Presidential years it "was
the scene of gigantic contests, for every strong national
character in both parties could be found there on the
stump. In such an excellent school Fairbanks was
trained for â¢ leadership, and when occasion'' came his
capacity was proved. He is a safe, sound and excellent
man, and at the head of the Senate will command the
respect of his countrymen of all parties.
The convention did its work well and made it promis
ing of the continuance of peace abroad and prosperity
at home. The country will indorse that work and there
will b* no steps backward.
his most sacred prerogatives. Nor is it at all likely that
any parent can find it in his heart to deny to the young
sters the privilege of popping off their torpedoes and
crackers ev^n when the arnica bottle looms large in the
foreground. But there is this old warning to be re
peated again as it has been repeated in the past: Caution.
If we cannot disassociate the Glorious Fourth from the
glorified firecrackers and cap pistol we can af least ta
boo the latter and most dangerous instrument of tor
ture and keep a careful eye upon the small boy's use of
the former. If. it is impossible to enjoy a more sane
Fourth let us for charity's sake keep down the death
rate.

Chief of Police Wittman returned
from St. Louis yesterday afternoon,
enthusiastic over the fact that the
next year's convention of the Chiefs
of Police of the United States and
Canada will be held in this city. He
has promised the members a good
time and will do everything possible
to carry the promise into effect.
"When I reached St. Louis," said
the Chief. "I found that Detroit had
a cinch on next year's convention and
I was told to wait, till the year after.
I went to work arid got a number not
pledged to Detroit to promise me a
complimentary vote. On the last day
of the convention Chief Downey of
Detroit sang the praises of his city
and Assistant Chief Stewart of To
ronto, Canada, made a strong plea for
that city. Then I spoke of the well
known hospitality of Californians and
urged them to come to San f rancisco
and partake of our hospitality. There
were 230 votes and on the first vote
San Francisco had a plurality of three
votes and Toronto dropped out. Then
on the second vote San Francisco had
a majority of thirty votes over De
troit and on motion of Chief Downey
it was made unanimous."
The Chief spoke highly of the won
ders of the exposition, saying that
those in - charge of the California
building were doing great work, the

The Government of the Netherlands
appreciates the services that George W.
Hazen of the secret service department
rendered that couptry last October. As
an earnest of that" appreciation it has
presented the officer with a handsome
watch, prcperly engrossed.
Early last year word was flashed all
over the world that a trusted official of
the Netherlands Government stationed
at Batavia, Dutch India, had abscond
ed with funds to the amount of $15,000.
In course of time the information
reached the chief of the secret service
on the Pacific Coast, and a watch was
set for the fugitive.
Early In September a man named J.
T. Jjce, who arrived from Yokohama,
wag deported on account of his papers
not being correct. "While he was wait
ing to be sent back to the Orient Agent
Hazen learned from him that Lee had
met H. W. Johannes, the man wanted
by the Netherlands Government, in
Yokohama and had arranged to meet'
him In New York In October. When
the Nippon Maru arrived here October
7 and wag held in quarantine Agent
Hazen learned that a man answering
the description of the fugitive was
aboard under the name of H. W. Aron
dez. As soon as the passengers were
allowed to depart from the steamer
Hazen made the acquaintance of Aron
dez. While coming ashore in the Gov
ernment launch Hazen told Arondez
that the Netherlands Consul wanted to
see him. No objection was made by
the suspect, who had papers which he
believed would pass him without ques
tion. In fact, the Consul informed
Hazen that he had certainly made a
mistake, but the secret service officer
would not look at it that way, and
flatly accused the pretended Arondez
of being the much wanted Johannes
and of having forged the papers -which
he carried. At first the accused stuck
to his story, but finally broke down and
admitted he was the person wanted.
When searched nearly $10,000 in
money and drafts was found on his
person and later delivered to the Neth
erlands Government. The prisoner was
subsequently returned to Batavia for
trial.
The gift from the foreign Government
is a handsome piece of the jeweler's
handiwoik, and on the inside of the
case bears an inscription reciting the
facts. The outside has the officer's
monogram prettily engraved. Agent
Hazen is proud of the gift, and as he
displayed it yesterday he said he would
cherish It as long as he lived.
CHICAGO, June 24.â The United
States Merchant Marine Commission,
created under the provisions of the
Gardner bill, passed at the last session
of Congress, conferred with Chicago
manufacturers, shippers, exporters and
bankers to-day with a view to formu
lating plans for rehabilitating the mer
chant marine of this country on the
high seas.
After leaving Chicago the members
of the commission will visit the Pacific
Coast. It is the intention of the com
missioners to formulate a definite plan
for increasing the number of ships car
rying the American flag and submit
the plan to Congress for consideration
next session.
Senator Gallinger, in calling the
meeting to order, said it was a source
of gratification . to the- commission to
note the great -interesr the. movement
had aroused among shippers and.busi
ness men in all partis of the country. - !
John Barrett,' former Minister to
Slam and Argentina and at present
Minister to Panama, said he had trav
eled around the world, five times and
had recently completed a trip of 50,000
miles lit the interest of the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition and in all his
Journeys regretted to say he did not
see one merchant marine ship flying
the American flag. He described the
great wealth of the Argentine republic
and expressedthe belief- that the Unit
ed States should establish a subsidiary
line of ships between. this country and
the principal South American ports.
Captain W.' Bates of Denver read a
long paper on the rise and fall of mer
chant marine. .

The Nome district, through a com
mittee of citizens, has sent a message
to the Seattle Chamber of Commerce.
The Nome Newa gives the text of the
message, which was prepared by E. B.
Barthrup, Ira Orton, W. A. Clark, J.
D. Thagard, George P. Goggin and
Captain Sundlach. The News reports
that other messages will be sent -tut
from time to time to keep the public in
formed about Nome. The Nome mer
chants have subscribed a fund for this
purpose. This proposition is now to
mining camps, and the novelty of it
will naturally attract attention. ..The
News declares that the, document is
conservative. In part it is as follows:
Never before In the history of Nome or the
Seward peninsula has the - outlook . been so
full of promise as at the present time. For
this there are many reasons, the first of which
is the fact, testified to by many well known
mining men, whose large Interests end long
experience here constitute them competent
judges, that the gold output . for the coming
seaoon will be greatly in excess or that of
any previous year. Under the most conserv
ative -estimates It Is thought that the spring
cleanup alone will reach one and a quarter
millions of dollars and many operators of
known Judgment place the figure much higher.
That "the output for the winter diggings wtU
more than double that of any previous year
all are agreed upon. >
To those who are not familiar with "pre
vailing conditions here this winter tluraljove
â¢Â¦stlmaie may ecem large, but when the reasons
for the great Increase In the gold output are
explained it will â¢ at once become apparent
that It Is no over statement of fact.
"The development of the winter diggings at
Nome and In the immediate neighborhood has
exceeded the ldÂ«as of the most sanguine and
the experience of the present winter season
has khown conclusively that the deep deposits
of gold bearing gravel In this vicinity are
practically inexhaustible. These deposits can
be profitably mined during the winter season
and make Nome an' all-year camp. That the
aleanup from the winter diggings will con
tinue to Increasa from year to year' Is an
assured fact.
The estimated output as above given Is. of
course, for the entire Seward peninsula, but
there Is no doubt that the Nome district will
produce the greater part of It, and to divide
this again. It is equally certatn that the
greater part of Nome's output will be drawn
from the divide between Anvil and Dexter
creek* and from the Dry Creek benches.
SOME RICH CREEKS.
Among the creeks In the Nome district
which will be the heaviest producers are the
Moonlight, a tributary of Anvil; Trlpple, Bour
bon. Cunningham, Peluk, Hangor, Osborne and
Buster. Inmachuk River and tributaries It Is
estimated will produce $175,000; Candle Creek,
$Â«5,0CO; Bluff City beach, $40,000; old beach
diggings east of Nome, . Including Peluk and
other creeks $125,000; Solomon River. $150,000
to $175,000; Dahl Creek in the Kougarok dis
trict will also be a good producer.
. Besides these specified a great many very
premising reports from other districts are ob
tainable, namely from the Kougarok River
country; Sinrock, Norton Bay, Gold Run and
Cfisa Up Para.
Solomon, one of the most promising dis
tricts of the peninsula, will be one of the
heaviest producers this year.
A number of very promising quartz prop
erties In the Solomon country have been un
dergoing exhaustive prospecting and develop
ment work this winter, with the result that
their owners, who are also . largely Interested
In placer properties In various parts of that
and other districts, are emphatic In their as
sertions that they consider their quartz hold
ings of much greater value than the pincer.
From somt of these properties many rich speci
mens tin produced In which considerable liee
geld may. be seen. '
PRODUCTION OF TIN.
At Tin City the Hands Â«liave erected a
$35,000 tin Plant, and it is reported that ten
times that sum will be expended for a like
purpose by the same company during the
coming season. Numerous other tin plants
will be Installed upon the opening of .'naviga
tion. The Bartelstolant will be worked to Us
full capacity this fpeason. : ana without doubt
the tin will~be one of the busiest parts
of the peninsula this summer. The tin belt,
so far as known. Is about 125 miles in length,
extending from Cape Prince of Wales to the
head of the Kougarok River. One I of the
ledges on Lost River- has been sold for $150,
000. . Â¦ . :
' Very little Is known here of what will be
dene in railroad building during the coming
reason other than what was given . out last
fall. The completion of tn"e Council City and
Solomon River Railroad Is an assured fact
and the material te already on the ground.
It was promised that this road would be
Immediately extended to Nome and the pur
veys have been made.
The Nome. Arctic Itallroad contemplates an
extension In the direction of the Nome River
and on to the Kougarok. The country needs
railroads and is rich enough to support them.
The further building of ditches for carrying
water for mlnlns purposes will be a feature
of the coming season. The Miocene Company,
which has already built a ditch from the head
of Nome River to Anvil Creek, a distance o(
twenty-nine mile*, will extend Its system still
further. The main ditch of this company
carried 800O inches of water. The Wild Oooje
Company has alreRdy built flfteenV miles pf
dlieh on Ophir Creek and will make Ian; e ex
tensions this summer. This ditch Is alBO of
large -capacity. The Topkok Ditch Company,
the Miocene Ditch Company and the Campion
Ditch Company will continue the work on very
extensive system*. The latter. Â¦Â» planned, will
be the largest of all. Other ditches to be built
are too numerous to be mentioned in a short
article, but the aggregate mileage will extend
Into the hundreds.
FAVORABLE CONDITION'S.
Recent develoaments in the mining
industry of the Pacific Coast are gen
erally favorable. In several sections
much activity is . reported. The exten
sion of dredger mining in California
continues to be a matter of interest.
News is received concerning various
dredging enterprises that are expected
to reclaim the gold that has long been
hidden In sands. Ground has been pros
pected near Red Bluff by Dr. McCuN
lough, who is preparing to dredge.
Three miles of creek bed have bean
bonded on Cottonwood Creek from sev
eral owners. Hydraulic mining was
formerly carried on in the locality.
Other parties have bonded other tracts
extending, for a distance of twenty
miles. The land near Red Bluff will
foon be prospected with the drill. A
phase of dredger mining is the in
creased assessment that is placed on
lands to be dredged. County Assessor
BerKey of Sacramento says that min
ing lands near 7 Folsom that formerly
were assessed at $7 to $15 an acre are
now assessed for purposes of taxation
at $100 an acre, and there is no com
plaint regarding the assessment.
The bonding of properties and the se
curing of options are indications of in
terest in varied branches of mining. W.
Hi Christie .has an option, bo reports
the Itedding Free Press, on the Bykcs
Mining Company's property, the Lar
pcn mine and the Vollmer ranch, at
Trinity Center, in Trinity County.
These properties include about 1400
acres of gravel, of which more than
half is reported to be good dre<Ig'ng
ground. A lease on the Nevada County
mine, In the heart of Nevada City, has
been obtained by* A. Maltman, super
intendent of the Murchle mine. The
Blue lfiad copper claims, In Siskiyou
County, near the Oregon lin?, 'in the
vloir.ity of Applegate, have been sold
to J. F.. Reddy and E. L. Jones. A bond
has tâ¬ er executed on the Excelaior nnd
Campbell mines to Los Angeles people.
These mines are In Nevada County.
The Grass Valley Union says. that the
Kenton mine, at'Aileghany, will prob
ably be Â¦ reopened. These are a few of
the symptoms that' show mining Inter
est. - â¢â¢
WORKERS AND PLANTS.
Men have been. put on the. Lincoln
shaft of the Wildman mine repairing It
preliminary to the reopening of the
mine. As soon as the works are in run
ning order and the mines are clear of
water the property will once more be
operated.
The Placervllle Nugget reports that
the Boneset mine, near Jurgens, will
have a new mill. Five stamps have
been added to the Mammoth mine mill
near Jurgens. The > new mill at the
Monte mine, in the Gold Hill district,
is running 1 steadily. The old Eureka
gold quartz mine shaft is being cleaned
OUt. ; . '^".'j*
A strike is reported to have been
made in Calaveras County, in the San
Andreas Gold Channel mine.
The Redding Free PreÂ»3 reports
that H. S. Wilson is of the opinion
that the Clover Creek Quicksilver
Company has a fine quicksilver depos
it on Clover Creek, Shasta County.
The company acquired the property
from the Modoc Chief Company. The
property will be developed. Supplies
and materials for the roasters, so says
the Free Press, have been shipped in
to the mine. . .
According to the Calaveras Chroni
cle there is quite a boom in the Rail
road Flat mining district in Calaveras
County. The Bullion and Riverside
Consolidated mines have been bonded
to E. L. Holder, C. W. Hlggins and F.
Brackett and development work has
begun on the properties. The mfnes
are on the south fork of the Moke
lumne River. Considerable work was
performed by the owners some time
ago, but they were hampered by lack
of capital. J. â¢ Haley of West Point
is reported to have good properties
on the Licking fork of the Moke
lumne. Dr. Aiken of Amador County
also has two properties on the Lick
ing fork.
Concerning Iwhat is doing in the
mining districts of Siskiyou County
the Treka Journal says in part:
"A shaft 250 feet deep has been
sunk on the . Headwaters mine - on
North Fork of Humbug Creek. The
McKinley mine on Humbug keeps
sixty men employed. The Spengler
mine is worked day and night with
full crews. Brokaw is sinking a shaft
on the Hull Gulch quartz mine in the
Quartz Valley district."
NORTH STAR EXTENDING.
The North Star Mining Company is
grading for a large cyanide plant that
will be the only one in the district to
date outside of a small one installed
by the company some time ago. The
Grass Valley Union says:
It has been known for several years that the
company has lost a few thousand dollars every
month by Its Inability to recover all the gold
from Its tailings. A Email sand plant has
worked these to some extent below the mill, op
erated by private capital. Superintendent
Foote, however, decided that a cyanide process
would work out with excellent results, despite
the fact that no mine In the district had ever
put one In. He set about experimenting, and
It is rot generally known that his company
had some of the most eminent chemista In the
West working on the proposition. ! embracing
some new features. Thousands of dollars were
spent in experimenting until it was decided
that a plan had been hit upon which would
give the desired results'. - - â¢ â¢ Â¦ . â¢ -
It Is evident that thin small plant met every
expectation, determining the company on the
erection of a large one to handle the entire
output of the new Central shaft 40-stamp mill.
It will be 6ltuated almost on the. edge of the
road to the Omaha mine, a short distance be
low the mill, and the sulphurets will be car
ried thither by a sluice. A new style of mill
will be put In to reduce the sulphurets to the
required fineness.
Â¦ Up to the present time the minÂ«s In this dis
trict have either shipped their sulphurets to
i-elby's or hauled them to the smelting works
between here and Nevada City.
The Amador Ledger says that the
Fremont-Grover mine that has been
shut down two months will remain so
for months to come if necessary. A
strike caused the closing.
A geological map of the copper
belt in Shasta County is in preparation
under the direction of .the United
States Geological Survey.
The Silver State says that the most
important strike in years in Hum
boldt County, Nev.. is the recent one
seven miles northwest of Kennedy.
Nearly every resident of Kennedy has
gone to the scene and has dropped
everything except the hunt for gold
and silver. The Silver State also
speaks of the find as "the new bo
nanza," and asserts that ore running
as high as $32 in gold, twenty ounces
in silver and ten ounces in lead has
been brought in from the camp and
assayed.
the news came out that an hour later
it was resurrected and reslaughtered
by a humane person who had heard
of tho interment and knew something
nhout the tenacity with which the fe
line species clings to life. The provo
cation for the shooting, Mr. Hamil
ton averred, consisted in the plunder
ins of his poultry yard by the cat. To
the animal's nocturnal raids he traced
the disappearance of thirty chickens,
which he had tenderly nurtured. It
was at 5:20 o'clock a. m. that he fired
the shot which he then considered
fatal. His weapon was a shotgun and
the charge was No. 12 buck.
Mrs. Nelson, owner of the deceased
cat. said that Hamilton not only filled
her pet full of buckshot, but also
hammered its heed with a rock ere
he buried it. On several occasions
previous to the "shooting: and the sep
ulture he had treated the cat cruelly.
Miss Anderson, a daughter of the
defendant, corroborated all her f ither
had said anent the cat's love of poul
try. She had seen her chickens at
tacked and carried away by the Nel
son cat and her total loss was thirty
six birds that were laying morÂ«Â» than
enough eggs to compensate her for
tireir board and lodging.
Hamilton wag pronounced jjuilty of
cruelty to animals and Judsre Fritx
will sentence him next Tuesday. The
Hamiltons dwell at 640 Connecticut
street.
F. Jorgenson, a substitute mail car
rier, and his wife aired their conjugal
infelicity before Judge Fritz and a
crowded auditorium. The man was
accused of assaulting the woman In
her apartment at 1207*^ Stevenson
street, a lodging-house kept by Mrs.
Lathrop. The testimony disclosed
another man in the case, a barber of
the name of John Glover.
Before contention separated them the
Jorgensons and their three small chil
dren lived in a home which the hus
band had built at Ocean View. Ac
cording to his story the wife was a
true wife and a good housekeeper until
her affections were alienated by Glover.
Then she neglected her marital re
sponsibilities and finally petitioned for
dJvoTce on the ground of cruelty, but
Judge Troutt denied the petition. With
her children she has been living in the
same house with Glover, and the hus
band's Jealousy has carried him to the
extreme of haunting the domicile. Last
Tuesday afternoon he forced his way
into the woman's room and she testi
fied that he resisted ejection by strik
ing and kicking her. for which she had
him arrested.
The defendant denied the battery and
Mrs. Gilman, who lives In the house,
swore it was his wife who did all the
battering and that while doing it she
screamed for help. The landlady sup
ported the prosecution - and Indignantly
declared . that^ if {she suspected for a
moment that Mrs. Jorgenson were not
a good woman she would put her out.
Jorgenson was pronounced guilty and
will be sentenced next Tuesday.

cusing conscience was the undoing of

from the scene of the theft. If he had
passed on without betraying trepida
tion the officer would have suspected
nothing, but he trembled so violently
and otherwise so plainly revealed dis
turbance of mind that he was prompt
ly stopped and searched. "That's all
I've swiped*," he said when the bottle
came to light. He pleaded guilty to
petty larceny and will be sentenced to
day by Judge Mogan.

embezzling about $300 of the funds en

NETHERLANDS' BE WARD
Count Susaserbin of Germany is
Bought by the police. They want to eet
him up before Judge Mogan to answer
*he charge of battery, the complaining
witness being: C Herbert James, a
collector for the San Francisco Gas
and Klectiic Company. James avers
that he *.\ats picked up by the .Count
and hurled through a glass-paneled
tioor.
Since he t^inie to the United States
about four years ago the career of
the Count .Susasechln has been marked
by eoeisl deterioration. The announced
object of his visit was to find a mil
lionairess â¢willing: to purchase his title
with his person as a necessary en
cumbrance, but his quest proved a
miserable failure. The title was all
:igrht, but the person was more than
the stoutest hearted would-be countess
< ould take unto herself as husband.
Nature as well as fortune had dealt
unkindly with him and to his burden
of lrnpccunioslty was attached the
physical unloveliness at a hedge fence.
Coy young heiresses at Newport, who
were just dying to have a noble pre
f x to their wedded name, fluttered with
oagerncss to nee the Count and fled
with "horror when they saw him. To
make matters worse, his wardrcrbe
gradually degenerated and, as he had
no means of replenishing it. he was
finally reduced to rags and necessity
of working for a livelihood. He tried ;
to return to Germany as a stowaway,
but made the trip as a coalpaeser in
the boiler room and so adept did he
become with the shovel that he decided
to stick to it. His present home is the
focs'le of a steamship plying between^
this port and the Orient. All his lofty
social aspirations are the saddest of
mf-mories.
So much of the Count's biography
was incidentally developed during the
hearing of James' complaint by Police
Judge Mogan. The alleged assault
took place at 430 Folsem street, a res
taurant recently transferred from Aug
urt Bonne to Joseph Erbin and Mary,
his wife, consideration not made public.
Bonne and the Count were seated at
a table in the restaurant when James
entered and presented to Mrs. Erbin
a "closing-out" gas bill for 515 40. The
lady informed him that she had just
taken possession of the place and re
ferred him for payment to Mr. Bonne.
To Bonne he accordingly went, to be
loudly laughed to scorn by that gentle
man, vociferously aided by the Count.
James then declared that if the bill
vi-ere not paid on the spot the gas
would bt shut off at once, and ere the
threat was finished he was grasped
by the Count and hurled through the
glass-paneled front door. His clothing
was tern, and when Patrolmen Laws
and Murphy responded to his shouts
for aid they found him physically as
well as sartorlally dilapidated. They
feund also that the Count had fled, but
they nabbed Bonne and charged him
Â¦with batter}'.
The case has been continued to give
the police a chance to round up the
Count and make him a co-defendant.
Jess Bennett's bridal tour was rude
ly interrupted Thursday evening by
hi? arrest for carrying a deadly wea
pon, to-wit, one fully loaded revolver
of 4 5 caliber and Colt manufacture.
Bennett traveled all the way from
Aberdeen. Wash., to Los Angelas, Cal.,
to wed Miss Ollie M. Bays of the lat
ter city, end the young couple were
blissfully proceeding by easy stages to
their future home in the north when
the gTOom committed the indiscretion
of conveying his shooting iron to a
terpsichorean function at Scottish
Hall, on Larkin street, and having it
checked with his hat and overcoat.
"Be sure," he said to the young man
who had charge of the cloakroom,
"to have this gun where I can get it
quickly when I call for it, for I don't
know how suddenly I may find use for
it." The young man took the pistol
and tiien sent word to Patrolman E.
J. Swfft regarding Mr. Bennett's ex
traordinary request.
The defendant apparently did not
consider his conduct extraordinary,
for he told Judge Mogan that in Aber
deen's exclusive set, of which he is an
exalted member, it is en regie for gen
tlemen to disarm themselves before
entering a ballroom, as shooting In
the presence of ladies Is regarded as
vulgar and punishable by ostracism.
His admonition to the custodian of the
cloakroom at Scottish Hall was simply
the precaution of a prudent pemon
who did not know what he was goinp
rgainst, as it was his first entrance to
San Francisco eociety.
Then the Judge kindly explained
that it was not for committing a
breach of any local social code, writ
ten or Â¦unwritten, that Bennett was ar
rested, but for violating the munici
pal ordinance which prohibits the car
rying of deadly weapons witho it spe
cial permission to do so. It was no
offense, but a distinct innovation, to
deposit the six-shooter in the cloak
room.
Thus enlightened, Bennett was dis
rharsed from custody, had his gun
restored to him and left the court
room with bis bride.
James J. Hamilton, a foreman at
the Risdon Iron Works, did not deny
that he shot and interred Mrs. Hat
tie Nelson's pet cat. but pleaded prov
ocation. TVhen he buried the animal,
he said, it was so rigid that he be
lieved it had ceased to breathe and no
one was more surprised than he when

On Thursday morning his identity

CILECIv RAISER SECURES
LIBERTY AT ST. LOUIS
The absence of many of the players
from town has made it Impossible for
them to participate. Aside from this,
however, the regular players seem to
prefer practice games to tournament
play.
The biggest surprise in months was
the defeat of Y. C. Lawson in the first
round at the hands of John 1 Reid. Mr.
Lawson won the second club champion
ship easily and was thought by r his
clubmates to be invincible. Mr. Reid
has always bowled well, but it was not
thought he would dispose of a man as
skillful as his opponent. The match
was a scientific one and closer 1 than the
score indicates.
Several new members of the club
seem to take naturally to the game,
and they should not be overlooked.
John T. Dare and David O'Brien are
probably Improving faster than any
others at present. Mr. Dare has been
playing less than a year, but occasion
ally takes a fall out of the cleverest
bowlers. Mr. O'Brien has been winning
practice matches every Saturday, and
the cracks are finding him a hard man
to beat.
The doubles tournament has been
completed down to the semi-finals, and
the three remaining matches are being
looked forward to with interest. M. L.
Crowe and J. M. Duncan will meet J.
S. Webster and G. C. Patterson. T. Mc-
Naught and James will meet Dr. Ham
ilton and.W. R. Eaton.
Despite the fact that Scottish bowl
ing is becoming more popular each
week and the rinks are taxed to their
utmost, the two tournaments in pro
gress are not the success that was ex
pected. Especially is this so in the sin
gles, where the number of defaults re
corded greatly outnumber the matches
played. There are several reasons for
this. In the nnst place the names of
all the members of the club were drawn
and many of them had no intention of
competing. Some of the defaults in the
prelimnary and first rounds are un
questionably due to this fact.' A better
plan would be to have an entry list and
let those subscribe their names who are
desirous of playing. This plan was
adopted in the doubles and defaults
have been less numerous.

o'clock, there will be a match of Gaelic
football between the Parnells and the

To-morrow will be the first Sunday
since the season opened on May S on
which a pennant match is not on the
schedule. The game set down is Mar
ried vs. Single. Though it is not un
likely that some of the well known
cricketers, who have played regularly
for the past nine weeks, will devote
the day to some other recreation,
teams will be picked up on the ground
from the players present.
The batting and bowling averages for
the present season have been prepared
and include all the matches except that
of last Sunday. H. B. Richardson,
captain of the San Francisco County
Club, stands far and away at the head
of the batting list with the remarkable
average of 357 runs. He has been at
the bat five times in pennant matches
and has lost his wicket only once.
This was on May 8, the opening day of
the season, in the match against the
Alameda club, when he was caught by
McCullough off a ball sent down by
Harold Ward. His scores have in
cluded 100 not out and 103 not out, and
his total of runs is 357. A. Jenkins of
Santa Cruz Is second with an average
of 77 runs. The averages for players
who have been at the bat at least
three times are shown in the table:

at 2:30 p. m.
Miss Miriam . Edwards of Berkeley
is the woman champion of the State.
She won the tournament last year,
which was the first for the State cham
pionship. She will meet the tournament
Will Allen and George Baker have
not decided whether they will play.
Either would stand a- fair chance to
win. Besides these players there are
many lesser lights who will be in the
competition. Herbert Long, Clarence
Griffin, George Janes and Tracy Craw
ford have entered and, while they are
not* expected to win, will make the
cracks work to beat them. .
One of these three players is almost
sure to win the tournament, but there
is considerable doubt as to which. one
will meet Grant Smith on the 4th. The
champion has been away for three
weeks" and has not touched a racket
for almost a month. He expects to
get into trim in the .week remaining
and can be counted upon to put up a
strong game.
Tennis enthusiasts are discussing the
possibility erf bringing a trio of the
Kastern cracks to . this coast for the
tournament in September at San Ra
fael. This has been talked of for sev
eral years but nothing has come of it.
Those who are making the arrange
ments claim that Bealcs Wright, Ward
and Clothier are willing to come. These
three players rank among the first live
in the United States.
The fourth annual tournament â¢ for
the championship of the State will
commence on the Hotel Rafael courts,
San Rafael, on July 1. The champion
ship match will be played on the after
noon of July 4. The winner of the
tournament will play Grant Â«M. Smith,
the present champion, in the challenge
match.
As usual the women's State cham
pionship will be held at the same time.
The championship match in this event
will be played on the morning of
July. 4.
On Sunday a consolation doubles
tournament for men beaten in their
first match will be played.
It was thought a fortnight ago the
State championship tournament would
be lacking in class, but Percy Mur
dock, J. D. MacGavln and Harry Wiehe
have signified* their intention to enter
and the event this year will probably
be the most interesting of the kind
ever held. The Southern Californians
as usual will not compete, but all of
the best players In this part of" the
State will be in the competition.
In the San Francisco championship
tournament Murdock, by playing a
clever game, wrested the honors from
MacGavln. The latter is practicing
hard and Is anxious to get a return
match with Murdock. These two play
ers are almost sure to meet." Harry
Wiehe has always been a prominent
player although he has never won
championship honors. He played four
years for Stanford and can always be
relied upon to put up a great flght.
Wiehe has been practicing at Mill Val
ley for a month and will be at his best
when the tournament starts.
â¢Well. I'll tell you. Faster than It was
â¢ver trotted by- any horse, and George (J
stepped it in l :01. , She can beat him doing
anything you can mention. I would like to see
her trot the Memphis track next fall when it
is In record breaking condition. 1 believe she
would step lamer man any trotter has ever
done, bar X-ou Dillon, and she might give the
queen a pretty close nib. She has more speed
than. Lou had with the tame amount of work.
She call stes a quarter now better than IM;
Bhe did.lt the other day In :2'.Â»U. Just 'buggy
ridini..' . Mr. Springer had no Idea he wan
going faster than :31 or 31 % till he looked at
his watch. It was no mistake; other watches
caught It the same. I saw Lou Dillon trot a
quarter .here la'st April a year ago in :2Â»V4.
when ' Millard Sanders thought her perform
ance would sell her to Smathers, who was here
at the ttme, and if he could have gone any
faster he would have done so. I saw Judge
Greene do the same distance In the. same time
(no faster) and both he and his driver were
making a supreme effort. I have seen George
G beat :.'tO. I have seen many pacers step In
:."(> and better, but never saw any horse, trot
ter or pacer, do a quarter In :3o or better
with the consummate ease with which that
little brown mare did the trick the other day.
No man ever saw a. trotter that could beat a
2:00 gait with such case. She Is the moat per
fect line trotter that ever stepped on a race
track; can speed to her limit without a boot
on and never touch a hair, wears only six
ounces in front and four behind, and an open
bridle. How can you beat her? She Is better
bred than any trotter -or pacer that has ever
sone in 2:w, she Is full of nervous energy,
stamina and courage, and I want to know
how are you going to beat her? She can step
any Dart of this track from an eighth to a
mile out faster than it was ever done by any
of the many champion trotters that have
worked on It. If I owned Sonoma Girl I would
not go bushwhacking her up through Oregon,
"Washlnston and Idaho, but .would take her
East, where the kings and queens of the trot
ting world will be assembled, and measure her
speed with their* s and perchance win a crown
for - the daughter of Lynwood W and Maud
Fowler." %:Â¦'.'-'Â¦" 'Â¦Â¦" '
Only a few short months ago the
wiseacres among the trotting horse
fanciers throughout the country were
saying there would never be another
trotter like Lou Dillon. California, the
land of promise for the horsemen, has
upset all these predictions while the
laurel is still fresh on the proud neck
of the trotting queen by giving to the
world another two-minute trotter in J.
R. Springer's Sonoma Girl.
A year ago Mr. Syringer came down
from . Idaho, broken in health, and
bought the mare, which is by Lynwood
W (2:20)-Maud Fowler, partly as an in
centive to keep him out of doors. At
the time there were many sly winks, as
the trainers at Pleasanton thought he
had .purchased a goldbrick. How far
from the truth this is may be judged
by the following extravagant praise ac
corded the unexpected /ival . to Lou
Dillon by a writer in the Breeder and
Sportsman:
"Thafs Sonoma Girl. - Ain't ehe a peach?"
"jsiie'b a kuou looking mare, but tiny tell
me she'll stop."
"'ihey bay she'll stop, do they? What
makes iheni think she il stop?"
â¢"Oh, because she is too pure gaited. Too
rr.achine-llke; trots too easy to be Kami."
"Uli, wouldn't that Jar --you? Trots too
easy to be game. Well, that s the beat I ever
heard. ' 'i here, she's scoring with Itajuh. tihe
can keep him company pretty easy. I hope
he'll stay on his reet, but they are not going
any, only 1:15 tu the nan. Now mey are mov
ing up a little. Oh, that pacer's broke. She's
waiting for him; It's a pity he won't stay on
his (set! you would see a merry hull, lie is
up to her again at the three-quarter pole.
Tnere he goea â another break; that's too Dad.
Ain't she a sweet guing thing? She's only
Jogging. What did you get it?"
"Half in 1:03'. Say, how fast could she
trot a half on this track If ehe was turned
loose?" . Â¦

Kogors Engineering Company of this
city, which has just completed a hand
tome motor-boat named Hazel for H.
L. Ricks of Eureka, will launch at the
foot of Howard street next Thursday
a boat that is expected to show great
speed. The motor-boat Rogenco is
Â¦40 feet long. 5 feet wide and draws 12*4
inches of water amidships. She is
equipped with a SO-horsepower, four
cylinder Buffalo engine, which is said
to be the lightest marine motor built.
3 1 drives a 34-inch propeller, with a 36
inch pitch, making TOO revolutions a
minute and drawing about 40 inches of
vater. The hull is planked with a layer
cf Port Orford cedar, covered with a
continuous piece of oiled Cape Ann
duck; copper-fastened to this is an
outer skin of mahogany. Hazel is 35
fp'-t by 5 feet, the extra length of
Kogenco being all in the bow section.
"Hazel is equipped with a 20-horsepower
Buffalo engine, and it is expected that
fche will make sixteen miles an hour.
Hazrl v.iil be taken up to Eureka on
th? deck of a steamer and will race in
the Fourth of July regatta there. Boat
ar.d engine together do not weigh more
than 2500 pounds. On account of her
greater length, higher horsepower and

SUMMARY. .
PORTLAND, Or., June 24. â The
Loo Loos took, the locals Into camp
to-day. When the boy at the score
board was through he had placed a
total of nine to the credit of the visi
tors and five for the home aggrega
tion. Jake Thielman had received a
mauling, during which four singles
and a double gave Los Angeles six
runs. Two were made in the first and
four in the fourth. Then Doc New
ton broke all records for passes by
walking five men and forcing in two
runs. This was in the fourth. After
walking Bee, Francis struck out and
Castro died with scarcely a struggle.
Raymond waited and walked; so did
Danny Shea. Newton then handed
Thielman transportation and Beck
was forced home, while the crowd
yelled. Nadeau paid for his passage
in like manner as Thielman and that
brought Raymond in without any in
itiation on his part. To the bench
with Dr. Newton. "Wheeler trotted out
to the slab and McCreedie swatted one
to Captain Flood, who was so rattled
that he juggled andThielman and Na
deau scored. When Thielman return
ed to the box he found the lead too
great and his delivery was easy for the
visitors. The score:

"Big Mike," a famous trout at Big
Meadows, has fallen a victim to the
pngiing skill of Alex T. Vogelsang, the
well-known lawyer.
For years this trout, which weighed
nine pounds, has been one of the sights
at the Meadows. Each morning he ap
peared at a certain point near the
bridge. His habits were so regular
that his name was carved in the rail
ing of the bridge above the point at
which he was invariably seen. The
hotel guests were accustomed to visit
ihi bridge each morning for a view of
the splendid trout.
The cleverest anglers tried their
daintiest LJenn flies on him and also
their gaudiest, but he turned up his
aristocratic nose at all their offerings.
It remained for Mr. Vogelsang to find
an Oriental tidbit at which he snapped
greedil}*, to his sorrow. The hotel cat
killed a mouse, and something
prompted Mr. Vogelsang to present this
to his troutship.
He let it float lazily down stream
and Big: Mike espied it. He gulped it
down at one swallow and with it the
barbed hook from which there was no
escape.
FAMOUS TROl'T "BIG MIKE"
TAKEN" BY VOGELSANG
During one intermission Manager
Gregpains lined up' four colored fist
artists of various sizes and weights for
a "battle royal." The last man on his
feet was to receive a prize. The fun
was fast while it lasted. Whenever a
fighter went down the gallery threw
bottles at him and resorted to other
stunts in order to keep the bout going.
Lew Powell caught Jack Hughes a
short hook in the stomach in the third
round of their mixup and Hughes sank
to the floor helpless. Up to that time
Hughes' great cleverness stood by him
and he was leading Powell by many
lengths. The knockout punch was. one
of the prettiest ever Seen in an ama-'
teur contest.
Sturdy little Dick Hyland laid Jack
Dunn low with a punch on the jaw
in the third round. Billy Howe, a sol
dier from the Presidio, with lots of
strength and no knowledge of the
game, was awarded the decision over
Jack Bell, a dilapidated welter, who
should have been in the hospital in
stead of in the ring. Mike Synfy easily
outpointed Young McClure, | Kid Parker
beat Roderick Earl and Frank Smith
got the verdict over Jack Warde.
Thomas did all the leading and was
not hit three good punches in the first
three rounds of the battle. Wolffe
st-emed to fear his man and devoted
most of his time to holding on. Thomas
landed repeatedly to the head and body
with lefts and rights and staggered
Wolffe on two or three occasions.
Wolffe, however, endeavored to redeem
himself by making a fast finish, and
it was his showing in the final round
that caused the Judges to be divided
in their opinions.
Willie Wolffe, brother to Teddy, was
treated in the same manner when he
hooked up with clever Jack Grey. Grey
had his man buffaloed for three rounds,
but Wolffe came fast in the last period,
when Grey scorned to be tiring. It
should have been Grey's fight, but
again the judges were at variance and
this mill also went as a draw.
Teddy Wolffe and Joe Thomas, the
steller performers on the San Francisco
Club's boxing card went four tame
rounds to a draw last nlÂ»ght at Wood
ward's Pavilion. It looked like
Thomas' fight, as he did whatever
punching happened to be done, but the
judges were even up in their opinions
and Referee Alec Greggains refused to
name the winner, bo a draw was the
TACOMA, June 24.â Oakland played
in hard luck to-day on the bases. Al
though Lohman'3 men made ten sin
gles and a two-bagger, only one run
â¢resulted and this was due to Graham's
wild throw. In the second Ganley sin
gled, stole second, took third on an
error and scored when Francks hit
safely. Eagan's home runs In the sec
and and the fourth gave Tacoma a
start. In the sixth Lynch's double, an
infield out, a passed ball and McLaugh
lin's single, brought in two more. The
last pair scored In the eighth on Nor
dyke's single, Eagan's sacrifice, Lynch's
second two-base hit, a passed ball and
Schlafley's pocr throw to the plate.
Two fast doubles pulled McDonald out
of tight holes and the Tigers fielded in
fine style.
Schlafley. Francks and Devereaux
also participated in fast plays. To-mor
row Buchanan and Keefe will indulge
In another pitchers' battle. Dunleavy,
who injured his hand yesterday, has
returned to Oakland, and Moskiman is

"Horses may come and horses may
go," say the racing men, '"but there will
never be another like Ormonde."
"The horse of the century" was
foaled twenty-one years ago In Eng
land. At Ascot, Newmarket. Doncaster
and Epsom he showed a clean pair of
heels to the fleetest steeds of his time.
Kings, Princes and Earls strained their
lungs as hard as the flotsam of the
paddocks when the big bay stallion
flitted ahead of the sweating, straining
"bunch" at the finish. Never was Or
monde passed in a race.
In 1839 the stallion was sold to Senor
Bocan of Buenos Ayres. Later Mr.
Macdonough bought him for $140,000.
He was taken to the Menlo stock farm.
Here the stallion was something of a
disappointment, for he left few de- .
scendants. In England, however, he
had sired Orme, a Derby winner.
While at the Menlo farm Ormonde
was afflicted with paralysis and be
came a pathetic picture of a fallen
monarch. Hobbling about painfully In
his paddock, he would sometimes try
to toss his magnificent head that once
lifted so proudly. The legs that once
seemed of steel weakened under him.
Even If horses have not memories the
dimming eyes of Ormonde seemed to
tell In their sorrowful looks that he did
not forget the glories of his past.
Realization of his fallen state also
seemed expressed in those mournful
eyes.
At last the sight became so pitiful
that Mr. Macdonough ordered the kinsr
of the turf put out of his misery. But
his relics will be preserved and no
doubt handed from generation to gen
eration as heirlooms.
In days to come when a classic event
is won by a neck-and-necK finish, and
the track reverberates with shouts for
a new equine monarch, the owners at
these relics will smile scornfully and
taik of Ormonde.
Only the fairest and most gracious
of the ladles who- patronize the track
will possess one of these relics. William
Macdonough, the last owner of the fa
mous stallion, has been overwhelmed
with demands for them.
The hoofs that once thundered along
the turf â always to the fore â have been
carefully preserved. Horsemen regard
thi'm as keepsakes to be coveted. One
will be mounted in gold and sent to
the young Duke of Westminster, whose
father bred Ormonde. Jack Casserly.
the turfman, begged for and was finally
promised a second.
"Imperious Caesar, dead and turned
to clay, might stop a hole to keep the
wind away." will not apply to Ormonde,
the departed monarch of the turf.
Ardent followers of the racing game are
making almost reverent preparations
to keep his memory green.
His mane, tail and hoofs will be pre
served and distributed among former
worshipers who follow the sport of
kings. The mane that fluttered in the
rush of wind at sixteen heartbreaking
races will be braided into chains.
Among horsemen these will be more
precious than strings of pearls or dia
monds.

SHEEPSHEAD BAY. June 24.âVet
eran turfmen rubbed their eye's'
they saw the hollow victory achieved
by Walter Jennings'* "Dainty in the
Thistle stakes to-day at the Coney. Is
land Jockey Club course. A few days
ago she was beaten by Sheriff Bell
after a dead heat, which Dainty should^
undoubtedly, have won. 'In the run off
on that occasion Bhe failed to stay",
notwithstanding the race was run to
suit her superior sprinting ability.-
Few who saw her defeated in the run
off considered that she had a chance
to-day and Whorler, which won the
Brooklyn* Derby last year, was made
a heavy favorite. His defeat waside T
cisi ve, however, for - .' after" Â¦ " running
prominently in company with Gay Boy,
he gave every evidence of bejxig in dis
tress. Dainty passed both leaders as
if they were anchored,.eventually/win
ning in a style that was astonishing.
Not alone did Dainty win handily,
but she established a ne*WjtEack record,
running nine furlongs in 1:52. The
track record was 1:521-5, made by His
Eminence last year. Two horses ran
remarkably good races in the event
won by Dainty. These were Buttons
and Bob Murphy, both of whom were
off badly. Both showed a great flight
of speed. Buttons lasted long enough
to earn second money. Summaries:

extra words and nothing to hang: an
other story on when he has finished.
Mr. Hitchcock is from Missouri.
The Republican politicians of that
State do not like him because he is
not a machine politician. The "West
ern Congressmen " who have con
stituents seeking to grab off large
chunks of Government lands without
much regard for the law do not like
him. He sees that the grab is con
ducted strictly according to law.
Therefore he is unpopular. He will
not do what the politicians want. A
strong combination of Western Sena
tors went after his scalp several years
ago, or just after President Roosevelt
came in. They didn't get It and the
crusade against him has about
stopped.
FIRST EMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA.
Mr. Hitchcock was nominated and
confirmed as Secretary of the Interior
December 21, 1898, but did not as
rume the duties of the office until the
February following. When he was
nominated he was Embassador of this
country to St. Petersburg. He was the
first Embassador of the United States
accredited to Russia, having gone
there as a Minister. He had not held
political office prior to his appoint
ment by President McKinley, who
thought a great deal of him. He had
been at the head of large business con
cerns in his home town of St. Louis.
Mr. Hitchcock was born in Mobile,
Ala., September 19, 1835, and is just
a month younger than Secretary Wil
son. From Mobile he went to New
Orleans. and then to Nashville, where
he attended school. He completed his
school course at a military academy in
Connecticut. He rejoined his family
in Ft. Louis, engaging in business
there. In 1860 he went to China to
enter the commission house of Oly
phant & Co., of which firm he was
made a partner in 1866. He retired
from business in 1872 and spent sev
eral years In Europe. Returning to
the United States, he again entered
business, becoming president of a
number of large manufacturing con
cerns. He remained at the head of
these concerns until he was appointed
as^ Embassador to St. Petersburg. â "â¢

seeing pollticfan, a close-mouthed
Cabinet officer and a valuable man to
Presidents. He has executive ability
of a high order, as shown In his
management of his department and
the handling of Important questions
arising there. He doesn't bother the
President much about the details of
the department, as he realizes that
the President is not a farmer and
doesn't understand' much about seed,
soil and scientific matters bearing
upon both. Occasionally he arises In
a Cabinet session and tells what his
department is doing in the way of ex
perimenting for the improvement of
agricultural conditions.
It may be a Japanese rice that Is
being raised in Louisiana, or It may
be something about the cotton boil
weevil In Texas but "v whenever" he
talks everybody listens, because he
says something, says it briefly, and In
well chosen language. He never talks
unnecessarily, ' and Is wonderfully
conservative.
THE BUSINESS MAX.
The chums of President Roosevelt's
Cabinet are Ethan Allen Hitchcock,
Secretary of the Interior, and James
Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture. They
are comrades in every sense of the
word. For years they have walked
away from the Cabinet meetings to
gether, except on bad days, when their
carriages were- waiting for them. They
manage to finish their work In the
Cabinet room about the same time and
leave the resident's offices together,
Mr. Hitchcock lighting a cigar as he
walks away /from the Cabinet room.
They stroll along together, talking
without animation and in the quiet,
conservative way so characteristic of
them. Generally Mr. Wilson has his
hands down in his overcoat pockets,
while Mr. Hitchcock has a bundle of
papers under one arm or in one hand
and his favorite cigar in the other.
The friendship between the two men
dates .back three or four years. They
are men of much the same tempera
ment arid naturally got together. They
began to like each other and the com
radeship fallowed. They are jocularly
twitted by the President as the "official
twins" of his Cabinet and the other
Cabinet members say funny things to
them and about them. They go on,
however, as they have gone for years,
believing in and admiring each other.
"Tama Jim" Wilson, as he is famil
iarly known in Iowa, and especially In
Tama County, his home, has been in
the Cabinet seven years, having enter
ed his present position with President
McKinley seven years ago March 4
last. He has served longer consecu
tively than any man in the Cabinet.
In fact he Is the only man now in
President Roosevelt's Cabinet who en
tered the Cabinet of President McKin
ley at the beginning of the latter's ad
ministration. He has survived all the
Cabinet changes* of those years, and
is one of the few Cabinet officers whose
resignation or disconnection with offi
cial life has not at some time or other
been talked of in the papers. His faith
ful work has impressed both Presidents
and he will certainly remain with Pres
ident Roosevelt as long as he desires.

TWO COMRADES
IN THE CABINET
The close connection between decayed
teeth and diseases of the digestion is
pointed out by a medical writer. The
presence of free acids in the mouth is
particularly harmful. These may come
from various sources, but most com
monly from the acid fermentation of
the carbo-hydrate food lodged on or be
tween the teeth at the gums and due to
the action of micro-organisms present
in the mouth.
Normally the saliva is alkaline, and
any adds produced in the crevices of
the teeth are thus neutralized and de
cay prevented. There are two condi
tions under which the saliva Is unable
to neutralize the acids produced local
lyânamely: First, when it is deficient
in alkalinity, and. second, when it Is
deficient in Quantity. As to the former,
it is, well known that the saliva be
comes less alkaline, or even acid, in
any condition of prolonged gastric di
gestion, a phenomenon which occurs in
nearly all cases of dyspepsia.
Moreover, the teeth when decayed
further tend to keep up the state of
chronic dyspepsia by rendering masti
cation Imperfect. A vicious circle is
thus established. To obviate this form
of dental disease the teeth should be
washed frequently with a solution of
which one of the ingredients Is bicar
bonate of soda. This may prevent one
of the most disagreeable results of
the diseaseâ facial neuralgia.â Chicago

I CHICAGO. June 24. â A cloudburst ln Kansas
was chief among the causes of a strong wheat
Â¦ market here to-day. At the clow* September
j wheat showed' a gain of %c. Corn Is off a
â¢ fchuUe. Data are down %c. Provisions are up
! 10c to 20c.
Under the Influence of higher cables and wet
: weather throughout the West and Southwest
' the wheat market started out strong. July
: opened !&&Uc to V* c higher at S4%(jJ$4%c to
StTfcc.' September was up V*c at SOc. During
the first hour there was a good demand from
commission houses and from shorts, the delay
to harvesting occasioned by heavy rains ln
Kansas anj surrounding territory being the
main stimulus to buying. . Prices advanced to
854c for July and .Â«0>;Â®90%c for September.
Later in the day local bears sold moderately
and some early buyers followed, causing, ti-ni
porarlly an easier tone. The July option exhib
ited most weakness, selling down to 84%c.
September eased erf to 79%c. One Influence
that prompted considerable nelllnsr was a pri
vate crop report, which was construed as bear
ish. Another source of weakness was news In
regard to the threshlriB of new whÂ«at. returns
being described r.s very promising. Liberal
Argentina shipments, which- had apparently
boen overlooked earlier in the day, tended to
depress t*i<* market. Within the laÂ« hour,
however, the market was bullish. A Jt-mani

the market weak. September opened unchanged
to a thade lower at ?>l'.A*r.t2c. sold between
30*:ic and 32&324C and closed at 31%c,
Provisions were firm en an active demand

Ths usual preliminary estimates or the week's
currency movement indicated a strong flow still
in course to New York, probabilities pointing
to a plethora of money In New York. An ex
pansion of loans is expected to result from the
', railroad bond operations of the week, but
scarcely sufficient to offset the advantage to
the surplus of the cash inflow. The stock mar
ket was benefited by the forecast of the bank
1 statement and by intimations of a cheerful
1 view of the commercial outlook by the mer
cantile agencies. The large buying of Union
Pacific was aUo resumed with a gain of 1%,
and Southern Pacific came into the advance
to the extent of %. The general market re
rponded with a recovery. The closing, how
ever, was barely steady.
Bonds were irregular ln sympathy with

said that the cutting of $15,000 out of

General Manager A. G. Wells of the
Santa Fe company arrived from Los
Angeles yesterday and is registered at
the Palace Hotel. He is here on a tour
of inspection.
It is common gossip in the Southern
Pacific Company's offices that the next
move made by President Harriman will
be the changing of Chief Engineer Wil
liam Hood's headquarters to Chicago.
No local confirmation. of the report can
be obtained, although It Is said that
the present visit of Engineer Hood in
the East has something to' do with his
removal to the new general headquar
ters of the Harriman lines in Chi
cago.
The announcement yesterday of the
appointment by. President Roosevelt of
Vice President Paul Morton of the
Santa Fe road to the position of Sec
retary of the Xavy was Immediately
followed by speculation as to who will
succeed the latter as the general di
rector of traffic of the big railroad
concern.
Among the local railroad men the
opinion is unanimous that Morton will
be succeeded in that company as sec
ond vice president by W. D. Biddle,
the freight traffic manager of the com
pany. It is generally believed that W.
A. Bissell, assistant traffic manager,
with headquarters in this city, will suc
ceed . Biddle and that Edward Cham
bers of Los Angeles, the present gen
eral freight agent of the Western lines
of the company, will become assistant
freight traffic manager. Mr. Bissell,
who has been 111 at his home for the
last three weeks, was up and about
yesterday and spent an hour at his
office on Market street. *
The recent election of C. H. Schlacks
to the position of vice president of the
Denver and Rio Grande road, and the
fact that he has retained his position
as general manager of the Colorado
Midland has been followed by the story
that the two roads are to be operated
under a double track arrangement.
Local speculation is rife over the
possibility of changes in the offices of
the latter road in this city. According
to advices received here by railroad
men the Gould people have been figur
ing for some time, on a means for re
lieving traffic over the Rio Grande and
have found it in a co-operative scheme
betwen that line and the Colorado Mid
land. The Colorado Midland at pres
ent cuts down 72 miles between Grand
Junction and Colorado Springs and,
counting the two Etops of twenty min
utes for meals, the train leaving Den
ver over the Midland for Grand Junc
tion makes the run in one hour and
twenty minutes better time than does
the Denver and Rio Grande.
The Goulds own the Denver. and Rio
Grande and hold the controling inter
est in the Colorado Midland, a fact
which would have prompted them long
ago to consolidate th^e two roads but
for the prohibitive measures In the
laws of Colorado, which prevent two
parallel lines from being owned and
operated by the same company. There
is nothing, however, in the law that
prevents the Goulds from holding the
controling Interest In two lines. Ac
cording to the information received
here the plan is to send a number of
the passenger trains and fast freights
by way of the Colorado Midland, which
will give considerable relief to opera
tions on the Denver and Rio Grande.
This scheme is sal* to have been the
main reason for making Schlacks vice
president of the Denver and Rio
Grande and keeping him in his position
as general manager of the other road,
with the business of which he is fa
miliar.
As soon as the afflicted fireman made
his appearance before the Commission
ers, Parry undertook to place him on
the gridiron for a good all-round roast.
Just as he started in to make the fire
hot for O'Rourke, President Boyne took
tides with the industrious invalid and
Incidentally threw out the hint that he
was being persecuted. Boyne said that
.when a man belonging to the depart
ment Is on leave of absence he can go
wherever he may see fit without the
consent of any Commissioner or other
person. Parry got red in the face and
Boyne got red in the neck, and It looked
exciting when Commissioner Barrett
quietly moved that the matter be post
poned until the next meeting.
What resurrected the trouble was
O'Rourke's application to the Commis
sioners yesterday for back pay, alleging
that he still suffered untold agony from
iiis injuries. In support of these allega
tions he produced a certificate from
1:1s family physician setting forth that
he had suffered all of the Ills with
Â¦w hlch a mortal fireman can be afflicted.
He had appendicitis, paresis, paralysis,
peritonitis, pyemia and is liable to be
afflicted. with softening of the brain be
fore he gets through.
Can a man grievously afflicted with
divers diseases make a book at a race
track? Is it proper for a fireman, who
Ly his own testimony should be eating
chic-ken soup and sleeping on a feather
bed. to deal in pools?
These were the questions that almost
caused Commissioners Parry and Boyne
to forget all that they had learned in
books of etiquette yesterday. The solar
plexus blow to harmony was caused by
the case of Daniel O'Rourke of en
* gine 19.
O'Rourke is reported to have ob
tained a sixty days' leave of absence
on the allegation that he had received
injuries in the discharge of his duties.
"While on his leave he hied himself
across the bay and started bookmaking
on the racetrack. This infraction of the
rules of the department and of the
charter was brought to the notice of
Commissioner Parry.
The Commissioner at once informed
Assistant Engineer Shaughnessy of
the infraction. Shaughnessy invited
O'Rourke to call at his captain's office
end explain his conduct. The indus
trious fireman pleaded that he needed
Ihe money, but was forced to turn the
'"graft" over to other hands and devote
(all his energies to fire extinguishing.

When asked; If there was anything
said about money,, the "witness de
clared he was to get $100 for the book
and that Veale promised him a
Job at $100 a month". He did not. know
what the nature of the work- was to be.
He could not ' remember that Veale
urged him to give up the book and
have it placed in a safe deposit vault.
urging that otherwise he "would lose
it before the trial," but he did remem
ber that he had lost it.* " /When ' asked
why â¢ he didn't "give up the book; 1 he
said that he didn't see any reason why
he should.
- Late iln'the. afternoon Josua Ep
pinger. was agajn called for, but, there
was no response. It" then developed
that the police have as i yet â¢. been "! un-
"Did you say that you could'nt get
any money, but you thought the credi
tors should get it for you?"'
"I don't remember." .
"Did you not say you had a book
the creditors wanted?"
"I think Veale said so."
Â¦ ; < : QUESTION OF MONEY.
James Deming, formerly superintend
ent of the warehouse at Crockett, was
recalled, but little information was
gathered from him. His memory was
very weak bn vital points. . Attorney
Campbell first questioned the witness
regarding his missing grain book, but
the witness had not yet found it.
"Have you searched" for it?" was
"I wasn't instructed to do so."
Deming then was asked regarding
the missing book and replied that en
tries regarding the number of lots of
wheat and their disposition were, made
in it at the end of each month. The
questioning then proceeded on the al
leged offer of money for the book by.
the prosecution.
"Did you not show the book to
Sheriff Veale?" was asked.
"No, I showed him an old one to
illustrate how the accounts were
kept." . ..''/^'^
"Did you not show him a book and
'say it called for 40,000 tons of grain,
while there was not one-tenth that
amount in .the warehouse?" This
question was objected to and the ob
jection sustained/ . '
Questions were then asked as to the
conversation in the office of Attorney
Campbell, when the alleged tender of
$100 for the book was made. The an
swer generally was, "I don't remem
ber." When his memory was re
freshed by a letter shown him the wit
ness remembered that he had written
to Eppinger & Co. saying he could not
obtain employment in other ware
houses owing to his connection with
that firm.
BOOK STILL MISSING.
Reginald Xorris, note teller for the
bank, identified a draft for $17,000 pre
sented him by a representative of Ep
pinger & Co., whose name he .did not
know. Â¦ . .
Colonel F. E. Beck, manager of the
International Banking Corporation, was
the first witness called yesterday. He
identified a number of warehouse re
ceipts. He had never received any
grain from Eppinger & Co. and had
never disposed of any warehouse re
csjpts from them. On cross-examina
tion by Ach he said that when he ap
peared at the office of the Pacific Coast
Warehouse Company Josua Eppinger
claimed to be the local representative
of the company. The witness had made
no demands for the wheat called for in
the "receipts until he received notice
from Henry A,ch of the failure of the
firm.
Upon this objection the court' Is of the view
that In all caÂ»?s where actual fraud and a
specific Intent are Involved (and the crime of
obtaining money* by false pretenses Is In
cluded In that category) evidenceâ of other
transactions, both prior and subsequent In
point of time to ths crime charged, which
tends to involve the defendant. Is admissible
for the purpose of showing motive, purpose. In
terest. Intent or guilty knowledge, even where
such transactions are not directly Involved In
the res K-staÂ» of the charge on trial, and al
though such transactions may represent dis
tinct crimes, when, as a matter of law, under
th* charge and the theories of the party offer
ing such proof. It might be lawfully found by
the JuJge* of the facts, from such evidence,
that such transactions were related to each
other, and to such charge, and that the evi
dence of such transactions would tend to aid
In the determination of the element of specific
Intent Involved In the charge on trial.
The attorneys on both sides spent two
days quoting authorities and arguing
the questions involved, and Judge Law
lor yesterday morning rendered the fol
lowing opinion:
The features of the trial yesterday
were the ruling of Judge Lawlor as to
the admission of secondary evidence
and the. testimony of James Demirig,
formerly superintendent of the ware
house at Port Costa. The decision ad
mitting the introduction of secondary
evidence Is deemed a blow to the de
fense.
Jacob Eppinger, the aged ex-grain
king who is charged with obtaining
money by false pretenses, almost faint
ed away in court yesterday afternoon
during the hearing of the case. He had
shown signs of increased weakness at
the' morning session, and as his condi
tion crew worse Dr. Whitney was sum
moned. The defendant's attorneys
asked for a recess that he might He
down and recuperate, but the court de
nied this, ruling, however, that he
might leave the room for a few mo
ments while the. Jurors were examining
papers offered in evidence.
Judge Lawlor said further that if it
appeared the condition of Mr. Eppinger
was so serious as to wararnt an "ad
journment he would have a physician
summoned. After spending a few min
utes in the Jury-room Eppinger, sup
ported by Dr. Whitney and his son Joe,
walked back into the courtroom and
was seated by an open window.. He ap
parently heard or saw nothing that
went on in the courtroom after his par
tial collapse. It is said he is suffering
from heart failure and the ordeal of the
trial is wearing him out. .
ADVERSE DECISION.
The rate to be adopted will be ap
proximately $113. Of this 93 cents
will be for running expenses, being 7
cents within the dollar limit; 7 cents
for the parks, the limit allowed by the
charter, and about 12.5 cents for the
bond redemption and interest fund.
The last two items are outside the dol
lar limit.
INCREASE IX APPROPRIATIONS.
The board will allow something like
$5,000,000 for delinquencies in the
payment of taxes. Further calcula
tions may even reduce the rate to a
lower figure than $1 13, as at this rate
the sum of $93,000 will be raised in
excess of the actual amount required
to pay the specific appropriations.;
The increased assessment will give
the park $357,000, which is $31,500
more than the $325,500 originally ap
propriate'd. Under the charter the al
lowance Is based on a special tax. of -7
cents. For the same reason the Pub
lic. Library will receive ?6750 above
the sum of $69,750 originally calcu
lated upori. a special tax of 1^ cents
being levied for library purposes.:
S The fact' that ,the. assessment ''roll
show an actual increase 'over the esti
mated amount of- about .$50,000,000
will permit the levying of a smaller
tax rate to raise the same amount oj
money. The sustaining of the Mayor's
vetoes to the amount of $32,200 will
also effect a reduction of three-quar
ters of a cent in the tax rate.
One of the Supervisors said yester
day that the rate would be lower than
that contemplated in the budget be
cause the board was averse to allow
ing some $400,000 to lie idle in the
treasury and no apportionment can
now be made of the surplus resulting
from the Increased assessment.;. The
board would therefore "adopt the lower
rate on Monday , next ' in consonance
with the assessment as returned by
Assessor Dodge.
; In -estimating the expenditures of
the city government for the next fiscal
year the board figured that it would
be. necessary to levy a tax rate of
$1.2053 bn every. $100 of an estimated
valuation of $465,000,00. Included in
this levy was $1 for running expenses,
7 cents for the parks and 13". 53 'cents
for redemption and interest fund, on
the new. bond, issue, which is" now up
for decision In the Supreme Court.;
The remainder of the total appropria
tions of $7,394,836,. amounting to
$17791,000. is to-be raised by licenses
and from other sources.. <

The Board of Supervisors? will on
Monday next adopt- a city tax rate that
will be at least Scents less than' that
of^ $1.2053, originally "calculated fn the
municipal budget.' This Â¦reduction.-. is
a- result of the' increased assessment
roll about to be returned by Assessor
Dodge, which' will aggregate* nearly
$515,000,000. .
On the items of $5000 appropriated for

ment on bonds, of. public officers and

tion the boardpulled itself together and
The appropriation for the public con
venience would have been passed over
the veto but for the fact, that the pro
posed station was to be near a public
school. Regarding the appropriation
for, public utilities his Honor accom
panied his veto of this item with the
statement, that he understood the
chairman of the Public Utilities Com
mittee was in the . habit of employing
help without the assistance of the
Mayor, Supervisors or Civil Service
Commission.
The majority against the Mayor was
not strong enough to overrule his ve
toes of the following items in the
budget: Three thousand dollars, for
Third and Channel street fenders, $7500
for public convenience station, $7503 for
a third elevator at the City Hall. $1200
for a stenographer for the 'Board of
Supervisors, $10,000 for experting ac
counts of public officers and city con
tractors, which item the Mayor cut
down to '$2000; $1000 for advertising.
$1000 for books for the law department
and $3000 for public utilities.
ACTION ON THE VETOES.
To this the board, adopting the
words of its Finance Committee, an
swered: "If y>er correctly apprehend
the Mayor from this and succeeding
sections of his message his allegiance
to the abstract principle of civil service
reform is unbounded; he is opposed to
it only in practice. However, it is ob
vious that his ambiguous declarations
of loyalty to the system are not to be
taken seriously." ..."
Then the board, still following the
Finance Committee, declared that "the
charges of his Honor scattered through I
the message would be painful- but for
the fact that these charges were â¢ as
ridiculous as they were hollow. .So we
must decline a frivolous quarrel of
words that would edify nobody and ,
would only belittle ' the legislative :
branch of the city government." I
The board was called to order by Su- I
pervisor Brandenstein, the Mayor being '
absent; and Alpers, Boxton, Bent, j
Braunhart, Comte, Connor, D'Ancona, j
Eggers, Finn, Hocks, McClellan, Kea j
and Sanderson present.
TheiMayor in his veto message had
said: "I- have no fault to find with
the principles 'of civil .service reform,
for if the practice accorded with the
theory a beautiful governmental fabric
could be created." -
' The Supervisors yesterday forenoon
took up their budget returned by
the -Mayor and quietly overrules three
of his vetoes. Fifteen members of the
board were present â Just Â¦ the number
needed . to handle the executive's offi
cial; objection to their proposed meas
uresâbut Alpers, Boxton, Bent, Rea
and Finn stood with the Mayor and cut
the re-vetoers down to ten except in
the case bf three items. . These items
were" therefore the only vetoes over
ruled. There were appropriations of
$5000 for maintenance of minors in non
sectarian institutions; $1475 for the pay
ment of premiums on official bonds of
public officers, and H5.000 for the de
fense of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany's suit.' '. .
y In some cases the board scored the
Mayor, especially when, in referring to
certain vetoes, it declared that it "did
not "recognize . the propriety of the al
leged vetoes and considered them in
valid a'nd void."
