a a ~% H. it's you. Is It!" was Mrs.
I Tanberrv's courteous observa
l J tion as she canted the vehicle
In ncr descent. She looked
sharply at Miss Betty, and
â¢yen the small glow of the carriage
lamps showed that the girl's cheeks had
flushed very red. Mr. Vanrevel, on the
contrary, was pale.
They stood for a moment in awkward
silence, while, from the lighted house
where the flying figures circled, came
the waltz: "I dreamt that I dwe-helt
in rr.a-har-b!Â« halls." Tom's own
dreams were much wilder than the
gypsy girl's; he knew that; yet he
bravely:
"Will you dance the two first with
me?" .
Miss Betty bit her lip, frowned,
turned away, and, vouchsafing no re
ply, walked toward the house with her
eyes fixed on the ground: but just as
they reached the door she flashed over
him a look that scorched him from head
to foot, and sent his spirits down
through the soles of his boots to exca
vate a grotto in the depths of the earth.
so charred it was with wrathful pity
and contempt.
"Yes!"* sHe said abruptly, and fol
lowed Mrs. Tanberry to the dressing
room.
The elder lady shook her head sol
emnly as she emerged from the enor
mous fold r.f a yellow silk cloak. "Ah,
Princess," she said, touching the girl's
shoulder with her jeweled hand. "I told
ycu 1 was a very foolish woman, and I
am. but so foolish as to offer advice
often. Yet. believe me. It won't do. I
think that is one of the greatest young
men I ever knew, and it's a pity â it
won't do.'' â¢
Miss Betty kept her face away from
her guardian for a moment. No in
considerable amount of information
had drifted to her. from here and there,
regarding the career of Crailey Gray,
and she thought how intensely she
would have hated any person in the
world except Mrs. Tanberry for pre
suming to think she needed to be
â¢warned against the charms of this sere
naoirs lady-killer, who was the prop
erty of anc-ther girl.
"You must keep him away, I think,"
ventured Mr/ Tanberry. gently.
At that Betty turned to her and said
sharply:
"I will. After this, please let us
never speak of him apaln."
A slow nod of the other's turbaned
head indicated the gravest acquies
cence, Sl.e saw that her companln's
cheeks were still crimson. "I under
stand.' said she.
â¢; A burz of whispering, like a July
beetle, followed Miss Carewe and her
partner about the room during the next
dance. How had Tom manased it?
Hcd her father never told her? Who
had dared to introduce them? Fanchon
Â¦was the only one who knew, and as she
Â¦whirled by with Will Cummings. she
raised her absent glance long enough
to give Tom an affectionate and warn
ing shake of the head.
Tom" did not see this; Miss Carewe
did. Alas! She smiled upon him in
stantly and looked deep into his eyes.
It was the third time.
She was not afraid of this man flirt;
he v.as to be settled with once and for
ever. . She intended to avenge both
Fan< and herself; yet it is a haz
ardous ..a me, this piercing of eye with
eye. because the point which seeks to
penetrate may soften and melt, leaving
one defenseless. For perhaps ten sec
onds that straight look lasted, while It
seemed to her that she read clear into
the soul of him. and to behold it.
through coma befooling magic, as
strong, tender, vise, and trus, as his
outward appearance would -have made
an innocent stranger believe him; for
he looked all these things; she ad
mitted that much: and he had an air
of distinction and resource beyond any
she had ever known, even in the wild
scramble for her kitten he had not lost
It. So, for ten seconds, which may be
a long time, she saw a man such as she
had ('reamed, and she did not believe
her Fight, because she had no desire to
be as credulous as the others, to be as
easily cheated as that poor Fanchon!
The luckless Tom found his own feet
beautiful on the mountains, and.
treading the heights with airy steps,
appeared to himself wonderful' and
glorifiedâ he was waltzing with Miss
Betty! He breathed the entrancing
words to himself, over ana over; It was
true, he was waltzing with Miss Betty
Carewe! Her glove lay warm and light
within his own. his fingers clasped that
ineffable lilac and white brocade waist.
Sometimes her hair came within an
inch of his cheek, and then he rose out
right from the hilltops and floated in a
golden miEt. The glamour of which the
Incroyable had planned to tell her some
day surrounded Tom, and it seemed to
him that the whole world was covered
vitl. a beautiful light like a carpet,
which was but the radiance of this
adorable girl whom his gloves and coat-
Bleeve were permitted to touch. When
the music stopped, they followed in the
train of other couples seeking the cool
ness of out-of-doors for the interval,
*Â»<: Tom. in his soul, laughed at all
other rcea with illimitable condescen
sion.
"Stop here," she said, as they reached
the open gate. He was walking out of
It, his head In the air, and Miss Betty
on his arm. Apparently, he would have
walked straight ' across the State. It
was the happiest moment he had ever
known. 2 . :p: p
He wanted to say something wonder
ful to her; his speech should be like the
music and glory and fire that was in
him; therefore he was shocked to hear
himself remarking, with an inanity of
utterance that sickened him: 7T"
"Oh, here's the gate. isn't it?" . "
Her answer wes a short laugh. "Ton
mean you wish to persuade me that you
had forgotten it was there?" \
"I did not sea it," he protested, 1 , la
mentably. s ;" -| ; .i; r | : ;: " ':
"No?" Â¦ 'Â¦'Â¦:&?. *
"I wasn't thinking of it." ' Â¦
"Indeed! You were 'lost In thoughts
of â " V *{
"Of you!" he said, before he could
check himself. ' â¢
"Yes?" Her tone was as quietly con
temptuous as she could make it. "How
very frank of you! May I ask: Are you
convinced that speeches of that sort
axe always to a lady's liking?"
"No," he answered humbly, and hung
his head. Then she threw the question
at him abruptly:
"Was It you who came to sing in our
garden?" v
There was a long pause before a pro
found sigh came tremulously from the
darkness, like, a sad and tender confes
sion. "Yes."
"I thought so!" she exclaimed. "Mrs.
Tanberry thought it was some one else;
but I knew that it was you." â¢ ,
"Yes, you are right," he said, quietly.
"It was I. It was my only way to tell
you what you know now." .
"Of course!" She set it all aside with
those two words and the slightest ges
ture of her hand. "It was a sons: made,
for another girl, I believe?"; she asked _
lightly, and with an icy. smile, inquired
farther: "For the oneâ the one before
the last, I understand?" > ,
He lifted his head, surprised. "What
has that to do with It? The music was
made for you â but then. I think all
music was made for you,"
"Leave the music out of it, if you
please.'.'-' she said, impatiently. "Your
talents make you modest! No doubt
you consider it unmaidenly in' me to
have referred to the serenade before
you sr>oke of it: but I am not one to
cast down my eyes and let it pass. No,
nor one too sweet to face the truth,
either!" she cried with sudden passion.
"To sing: that song in the way you did.
meantâ oh, you thought I would flirt
with you! What right had you to ccme
with such a song to me?"
Tom intended . only to disclaim the
presumption, so far fiom his thoughts,
that his sens had moved her, for he
could see that her attack was prompted
by her inexplicable impressron that he
had assumed the attitude of a con
queror, but his explanation began un
fortunately.
"Forgive me. I think you have com
pletely misunderstood: you thought it/
meant something I did not intend, at
all, and â "
"What!" she said, her eyes blazed, for
now she beheld him as the arrant sneak
of the world. He, the lady-killer, with
his hypocritical air a? strength and
melancholy sweetness, the leader of I
drunken revels, and, by reputation, the
town Lothario and Light-o'-Love, un
der promise of marriage to Fanchon
Bareaud, had tried to make love to an
other girl, and now his cowardice in
trying to disclaim what he had done
lent him the insolence to say to this
other: "My child, you are betrayed by
your youth and conceit; you exagger
ate my meaning. I had no intention to
distinguish you by coquetting with
you!" This was her interpretation of
him; and her indignation was not les
sened by the inevitable conclusion that
be, who had been through so many
scenes with women, secretly found her
simplicity diverting. Miss Betty had a
little of her father in her; while it was
part of her youth, too, Ghat, of all
things she could least endure the
shadow of a smile at her own expense.
"Oh, oh!" she cried, her voice shak
ing with anger. "I suppose your bad
heart is half-choked with your laughter
at me."
She turned from him swiftly, and left
him.
Almost running, she entered the
house, and hurried to a seat by Mrs.
Tanberry, nestling to her like a young
sapling on a hillside. Instantaneously,
several gentlemen, who had hastily ac
quitted themselves of various obliga
tions In order to seek her sprang for
ward with eager greetings, so that
when the stricken Tom, dazed and'
confounded by his evil luck, followed
her at about five paces, he found him
self confronted by an Impenetrable ab
atis formed by the spiked tails of the
coats of General Trumble, Madrillon,
Tappingham Marsh, Cummings and
Jefferson Bareaud. Within this forti
fication rang out laughter and sally
from Miss Carewe: her color was high
and her eyes sparkled never more
brightly.
Flourish and alarums sounded for a
quadrille. Each of the semicircle,
firmly elbowing his neighbor, begged
the dance of Miss Betty; but Tom was
himself again, and laid a long, strong
hand on Madrillon's shoulder, pressed
him gently aside, and said:
"Forgive me. Miss Carewe has hon
ored me by the promise of this qua
drille."
He bowed, offering his arm. and none
of them was too vain to envy that bow
and gesture. â¢ x '
For a moment he remained waiting.'
Miss Carewe rose slowly, i and/ directly
facing him, said in composed and even
voice: "You force me to beg, you never
to address me again."
She placed her hand on the general's :
arm, turning her back squarely f upon
Tom.
In addition to those who heard, many
persons in that part of the room saw
the affront and paused In arrested' at- ?
titudes; others, observing these,' turned
inquiringly, so that sudden silence
fell, broken only by the voice of Miss
Betty as she moved away, talking
cheerily to the general. Tom was left
standing alone in the : broken semi
circle.
All the eyes swept from her to him :
and back; then every one began to talk;
hastily about nothing. The young
man's humiliation was public.
He went to the. door under cover of
the movement of the various couples to
flud places in the quadrille, yet every
sidelong glance In tfce room still rested
upon him, and he knew it. He re
mained in tha hall, alone, through that
dance, and at its conclusion walked
slowly through the rooms, speaking to
people, here and there, as though
nothing had happened, but when the
music sounded again, he went to .the
dressing-room, found his hat and
cloak, and left the he-use. For a while
he stood on the opposite side of the
street, watching the lighted windows,
and twice he caught sight of the lilac
and white brocade, the dark hair, and
Xhe wreath of marguerites. Then, with
a hot pain in his breast, and the step of
a grenadier, he marched down the
street.
In #ie carriage Mrs. Tanberry took
Betty's hand in hers. "I'll do as you
wish, child," she said, "and never
speak to you of him again as long as I
live, except this once. I think it was
best for his own sake as well as yours,
butâ"
"He needed a lesson," interruqted
Miss Betty, wearily. She had danced
long and hard, and she was very tired.
Mrs. Tanberry's staccato laugh came
out irrepresslbly. 'All the vagabonds
do. Princess!" she cried. "And I think
they are getting it."
"No, no, 1 don't mean â "
"We've turned their heads, my dear,
between us, you and I; and we'll have
to turn 'em again, or they'll break their
necks looking over their shoulders at
us, the owls!" She pressed the girl's
hand affectionately. "But you'll let me
say something just once, and forgive
me because we're the same foolish age.
you know. It's only this: The next
young man you suppress take him off
in a corner! L,pad him away from the
crowd where he won't have to stand
and let' them look at him afterward.
That's all, my dear, and you mustn't
mind."
"I'm not s,orry!" said Miss Betty,
hotly. "I'm not sorry!"
' N", no," said Mrs. Tanberry, sooth
ingly. "It was better this time to do
just what you did. I'd have done it
myself, to make quite sure he would
kpop away â because I like him."
"I'm nc-t sorry!" said Miss Betty
again.
"I'm not sorry!" she repeated and re
iterated to herself after Mrs. Tanberry
had gone to bed. Phe had sunk into a
rhair in the library with a book, and
"I'm not sorry!" rhe whispered as thÂ»
open unread page blurred before her,
"I'm not sorry!" He had needed his
lesson; but she had to bear the recol
lection ot how white his face went when
he received it. Her affront had put
about him a strange loneliness; the one
figure with the stilled crowd staring;
it had made a picture from which her
mind's eye had been unable to escape,
danced she never so hard and late. Un
consciously. Robert Carewe's daughter
had avenged the other figure which had
stood in lonely humiliation before the
staring eyes.
"I'm not sorry!" Ah, did they think
it was in her to hurt any living: thing
in the world? The book dropped from"
her lap, and she bowed her head upon
her hands. "I'm not sorry!" â and tears
upon the small lace gauntlets!
She saw them, with an incoherent ex
clamation, half self-pitying, half im
patient, ran out to the stars above her
garden.
She was there for perhaps half an
hour, and Just before sh_ returned to
the house she did a singular thing.
Standing where all was clear to the
sky, where she had stood after her tall:
with the Incroyable, when he had bid
her look to the stars, she raised her
arms to them again, her face, pale with
a great tenderness, uplifted.
"You, you, you!" she whispered. "I
love you!"
And yet it was to nothing definite, to
no- man, npr outline of a man, to no
phantom nor dream lover, that she
spoke; neither to him she hud af
fronted, nor to him who had bidden her
look to the stars. Nor was it to the
stars themselves.
She returned slowly and thoughtfully
to the house, wondering what she had
meant.

TARKINGTON
CHAPTER XL
A VOICE IN A GARDEN.
Crailey came home the next day with
a new poem, but no fish. He lounged
up the stairs, late in the afternoon,
humming cheerfully to himself, and
dropping his rod in a corner of Tom's
office, laid the poem on the desk before
his partner, produced a large, newly
replenished flask, opened It, stretched
himself comfortably upon a capacious
horse-hair sofa, drank a deep draught,
chuckled softly, and requested Mr.
Vanrevel to set the rhymes to music
Immediately.
"Try it on your instrument," he said.
"It's a simple verse about nothing but
stars, and you can work It out in twen
ty minutes with the guitar."
"It is broken," said Tom, not looking
up from his work.
"Broken! When?"
"Last night."
"Who broke it?"
"It fill from the table in my room."
"How? Easily mended, isn't it?"
I think I shall not play it soon
again."
Crailey swung his long legs off the
sofa and abruptly sat upright. "What's
this?" he asked, gravely.
Tom pushed his papers away from
him, rose and went to- the dusty win
dow that looked to the west, where, at
the end of the long street, the sun was
setting behind the ruin of charred tim
bers on the bank of the shining river.
"It seems that I played opce too of
ten," he said.
Crailey was thoroughly astonished.
He tuok a long, affectionate pull at the
ilusk and offered it to his partner.
"No," said Tom, turning to him with
a troubled face, "and it I were you, I
wouldn't either. These fishing trips of
yoursâ"
"Fishing!" Crailey laughed. "Tries
of a poetaster! It's then I write best,
and write I will! There's a poem, and
a damned good one, toe/, old preacher,
In every gill of whisky, and I'm the
iad that can extract it! Lord! what's
better than to be out in the open, all by
yourself In the woods, or on the river?
Think of the long nights alone with the
Slery of heaven and a good demijohn.
Why, a man's thoughts are like actors
performing in the air and all the
crowding stars for audience! Y&u know
In your soul you'd rather have me out
there, going it all by myself, than
raising thunder over town. And you
know, too, it doesn't tell on me; it
doesn't show: You couldn't guess, to
save your life, how much I've had to
day, now, could you?"
"Yes," returned the other, "I could."
"Well, well," said Crailey, good-na
turedly, "we weren't taikinK of me."
He set down the flask, went to his
friend and dropped a hand lightly cm
his shoulder. "What made you break
the guitar? Tell me."
"What makes you think I broke it?"
asked his partner sharply.
"Tell me why you did it," said
Crailey.
And Tom, pacing the room, told him.
while Crailey stood in silence, looking
him eagerly In the eye whenever Tom
turned his way. The listener inter
rupted seldom; once It was to exclaim:
"But you haven't said why you brake
the guitar?"
" 'If thine eye offend thee. pluck it
out!' I ought to have cut off the hands
that played to her."
"And cut your throat for singing" to
her?"
"She was right!" the other answered,
striding up and down the room.
"Rightâ a thousand times!â in every
thing she did. That I should even ap
proach her, was an unspeakable Inso
lence. I had forgotten, and so, possi
bly, bad she, but I had not even been
properly introduced to her."
"No, you hadn't, that's true," ob
served Crailey, reflectively. "You
don't' seem to have much to reproaoh
her with, Tom."
"Reproaoh her!" cried the other.
"That I should dream she would speak
to me or have anything to do with me
was to cast a doubt upon her loyalty
as a daughter. She was right, I aay!
And she did ths only thing she could
do; rebuked me before them all. No
one ever merited what he got more
roundly than I deserved that. Who
was I, in her eyes, that I should be
siege her with my Importunities, who
but her father's worst enemy?"
Deep anxiety knitted Crailey's brc/w.
"I understood she knew of the quar
rel," he said, thoughtfully. "I saw that,
the other evening when I helped her
out of the crowd. She spoke of it on
the way home, I remember; but how
did she know that you were Vanrevel?
No one in town would be apt to men
tk i you to her."
"No, but she did know, ybu see."
"Yes," returned Mr. Gray slowly.
"So it seems! Probably her father told
her to avoid you, and described you so
that she recognized you as the man
who caujht the kitten." â¢
He paused, picked up th? flask, and
again applied himself to it 3 cont-nts,
his. eyes peering over the uptillted
vessel at Tom. who continued to pace
up and down the length of the office.
After a time, Crailey. fumbling In his
coat, found a long cheroot, and, as he
lit it, inquired casutuiy:
"Do you remember if she addressed
you by name?"
"I think not," Tom answered, halting.
"What does it matter?"
Craiiey drew a deep breath.
â¢'It dessn't," he returned.
"She knew me well enough." said
Tom, sadly, is be resumed Ws sentry
go.
"Yes," repeated Crailey, deliberately.
"So it seems; so it seems!" He blew a
long stream of smoke out into the air
beforo him, and aoftly murmured
again: "So it seems, so it seems."
Silence fell, broken only by the sound
of Tc-m's footsteps, until, presently,
some one informally shouted his name
from the street below. It was only Will
Cummings, passing the time of day, but
whan Tom turned from the window af
ter answering him. Crailey, his poem,
and his flask were gone.
That evening Vanrevel sat in the
dusty office, driving himself to his
work with a sharp goad, for there was
a face that came between him and a!!
else in the world, and a voice that
sounded always in his ears. But the
work was done before he rose from his
chair, though he showed a haggard vis
age as he bent above his candles to
blew them out.
It was eleven o'clock; Crailey had not
come back, and Tom knew that his
light-hearted friend would not return
for many hours; and so. having no
mind to read, and no belief that hÂ«
could if he tried, he went out to walk
the streets. He went down to the
river first, and stood for a little while
gasing at the ruins of the two ware
houses, and that was like a man with a
headache beating his skull against a
wall. As he stood on the blackened
wharf he saw how the charrM beam*
rose above him aarainst the sky like a
gallows, and it seemed to him that
nothing could have been Â» better sym
bol for there he had hanged his self
respect. "Reproach her!" He, who
had so displayed his imbecility before
her' Had he been her father's best
friend be should have had too great a
sense of shame to dare to speak to her
after that night when her quiet intelli
gence had exhibited him to himself,
and to all the world, as nought elsu
than a fool -and a noisy one at that'
Suddenly a shudder convulsed him:
he struck his open palm across his fore
head and spoke aloud, while, from
horizon to horizon, the night air grew
thick with the whispered laughter of
observing "hobgoblins:
"And even if there had been no- stair
way, we could have slid down the bosÂ»
line!" :
He retraced his steps, a tall, tray
figure moving slowly through the blue
darkness, and his lips formed the heart
sick shadow of a smile when he found
that he had unconsciously turned Into
Carewe street. Presently he came to a.
gap in a hedge, through which ho had
sometimes stolen to hear the sound of
a harp and a girls voice singing; but
he did not enter there to-night, though
he paused a moment, his head bowed on
his breast.
There came a sound of to Ices; they
seemed to be moving toward the hedg?,
toward the gap where he stood; one a
man's eager, quick, but very musical;
the other, a girl's, a rich and clear con
tralto that passed into- Tom's soul like
a psalm of rejoicing- and like a scimitar
of flame. He shivered, and moved
away quickly,. but not before the man's
voice, somewhat ; louder for the moment,
came distinctly from the other side of
the hedge:
"After all," said the voice, with a
ripple of laughter, "after all. weren't
you a little hard on that poor Mr
Gray"
Tom did not understand, but he knew
the voice. It was that of Crailey Gray.
, He heard the same voice again that
night, and again stood unseen. Long
after midnight he was still tramping
the streets on his lonely rounds, when
he chanced to pass the Rouen House
which hostelry bore, to the uninitiated
eye, the appearance of having closed Its
doors upon all hospitalities for the
night. in strict compliance with the law
of the city fathers, yet a slender wand
of bright light might be discovered un
derneath the street door of the ' bar
room.
From within the merry retreat issued
an uproar of shouting, raucous laughter
and the pounding of glasses on table?,
heralding all too plainly the hypocrisy
of the landlord, and possibly that of the
city fathers also. Tom know what com
pany was gathered there; gambles,
truckmen, drunken farmers, men from
the river steamers making 'riot while
their boats lay at the wharf. with a mot
ley gathering of good-for-nothings of
the back alleys, and tippling clerks from
the. Main street stores. There Came
loud cries for a song, and, in answer,
the voice of Crailey rose over the gen
eral din, somewhat hoarse, and never
so musical when he sang as when he
spoke, yet so touching 1 in its dramatic
tenderness that soon the noise fell
away, end the roisterers sat quietly to
listen. It was not the first time Ben
Jonson's sons had ; stilled a disrepu
table company.

Perhaps, just then. Vanrevel would
have wished to hear him sing anything
in the world rather than that, for on
Crailey's" lips it carried too much. mean-
Ing to-night, after the voice in the gar
den. And Tom lingered no more near
the betraying sliver of light beneath
the door than he had by the gap iÂ© the
hedge, but went steadily on his way.
Not â¢ far from the hotel he passed a
small building brightly lighted and*-' holng with unusual clamors of lrrdus-
Lhe office of the Rouen Journal.
The press was going, and Mr. Cum
minpf-' thn figure crossed and re-
I thp windows, while his voice
could be heard energetically bidding
his assistants to "Look alive!" so that
TÂ«..ni imagined that something might
have happened between the Nueces
River and the Rio Grafede: but he did
not st.<p to ask the Journalist, for he
desired to behold the face of none of
his friends until he had fought out
some things within himself. So he
strode on toward nowhere.
Day was breaking when Mr. Gray
climbed the stairs to his room. There
were two flights, the ascent of the first
of which occupied about half an hour
of Cralley's invaluable time; and the
second mlgrht hare taken more of it. or
possibly consumed the greater part of
the morning, had he received no as
sistance. But, as he reclined to medi
tate upon the first landing, another
man entered the hallway from without,
ascended quickly, and Crailey became
pleasantly conscious that two strong
hands had lifted him to his feet; and,
presently, that he was being borne
aloft upon the newcomer's back. It
seemed quite a Journey, yet the mo
tion was soothing, so he made no ef
fort to open his eyes, until he found
himself gently deposited upon the
oeueb In his own chamber, when he
smiled amiably, and, looking up, dis
ororod his partner standing- over him.
Tom was very pale and there were
aeep, violet scrawls beneath his eyes.
For oaoe In his life he had come home
later than Crailey.
"First time, yon know," said Crailey,
with difficulty. "Tooil admit first time
completely Incapable? Often needed
rulding hand, but never â quite â be

"Yes." said Tom, quietly, "It is the
first time I ever saw you quite fin

"Think I must be growing old and

"Then it's m, devil of a pity he can't
fee the only man to die!"
"Have they called for volunteers?"
asked Tom, going toward the door.
"No; but if the news is true, they
will."
"Yes," said Tom; and as he reached
the hallway Jie paused. "Can I help
you to undress?"
"Certainly not!" Crailey sat up, in
dignantly. "Can't you see that I'm
perfectly sober? It was the merest tem
porary fit, and I've shaken it off. Don't
you see?" He got upon his feet, stag
gered, but shook himself like a dog
coming out of the water, and came to
the door with infirm steps.
"You're going to bed, aren't you?"
asked Tom. "You'd much better."
"No." answered Crailey. "Are you?"
"No. I'm going to work."
"You've been up all night, too, haven't
you?" Crafley put his hand on the
other's shoulder. "Were you hunting
for me?"
"No; not last night."
Crailey lurched suddenly, and Tom
caught him about the waist to steady
him.
"Sweethearting, tippling, vingt-et-un,
or poker, eh, Tom?" he shouted, thick
ly, with a wild laugh. "Ha, ha, old
smug face, up to my bad tricks at last!"
But, recovering himself immediately, he
pushed the other off at arm's length,
and slapped himself smartly on the
brow. "Never mind; all right, all
rightâ only a bad wave, now and then.
A walk will make me more a man than
ever."
"You'd much better go to bed, Crai
ley."
"I can't. I'm going to change my
clothes and go out."
"Why?"
Crailey did not answer, but at that
moment the Catholic church bell, sum
moning the faithful to mass, pealed
loudly on the morning air; and the
steady glance of Tom Vanrevel rested
upon the reckless eyes of the man be
side him as they listened together to
its insistent call. Tom said, gently, al
most timidly:
"You have an â engagement?"
This time the answer came briskly.
"Yes; I promised to take Fanchon to
the cemetery before breakfast, to place
some flowers on the grave of the little
brother who died. This happens to be
his birthday."
It was Tom who averted his eyes, not
Crailey.
"Then you'd best hurry," he said,
hesitatingly: "I mustn't keep you," and
went downstairs to his office with
flushed cheeks', a hanging head, and an
expression which would have led a
stranger to V^lieve that he had Just
been caucht in a lie.
He went to the Main street window,
and seated himself upon the ledge, the
only one in the room not too dusty for
occupation; for here, at this hour, Tom
had taken his place every morning
since Elizabeth Carewe had come from
the convent.^ The window was a coign
of vantage, commanding the corner of
Carewe and Main streets. Some dis
tance west of the corner, the Catholic
church cast its long shadow across
Main street, and in order to enter the
church, a person who lived upon Ca
rewe street must pass the corner, or
else make a half-mile detour and ap
proach from the other direction â which
the person never did. Tom had thought
it out the first night that the image of
Miss Betty had kept him awakeâ and
that was the first night Miss Carewe
spent in Rouenâ the St. Mary's girl
would be sure to go to mass every day,
which was why the window-ledge was
dusted the next morning;
The glass doors of the little corner
drug store caught the early sun of the
hot May morning* and became like
sheets' of polished brass; a farmer's
wagon rattled do-wji the street; a group
of Irish waitresses from the hotel made
the board walk rattle under their hur
ried steps as they went toward the
church, talking busily to one another;
and a blinking youth in his shirt
sleeves, who wore the air of one newly,
but not gladly, risen, began to strug
gle mournfully with the shutters of Ma
drillon's bank. A moment later. Tom
heard Crailey come down the stairs,
sure of foot and humming lierhtly to
himself. The door of the office was
closed; Crailey did not look in, but
presently appeared, smiling, trim, im
maculate, all in white linen, on the op
posite side of the street, and offered
badinage to the boy who toiled at the
shutters.
The bell had almost ceased to ring
when a lady, dressed plainly in black,
but graceful and tall, came rapidly out
of Carewe street, turned at the cor
ner by the little drug store, and went
toward the church. The boy was left
staring, for Crailey's banter broke off
in the middle of a word.
He overtook her on the church steps,
and they went in together.
That afternoon Fanchon Bareaud told
Tom how beautiful her betrothed had
been to her; he had brought her a great
bouquet of violets and lilies-of-the
valley, and had taken her to the ceme
tery to place them on the grave of her
baby brother whose birthday it was.
Tears came to Fanchon's eyes as she
spoke of her lover's goodness, and of
how wonderfully he had talked as they
stood beside the little grave.
"He was the only one who remem
bered that this was poor tiny Jean's
birthday!" she said, and sobbed. "He
came Just after breakfast and asked me
to go out there with him."
CHAPTER XH.
THE ROOM IN THE CUPOLA.
Mr. Carewe returned, one warm May
afternoon, by the six, o'clock boat,
which was sometimes a day late and
sometimes a few hours early; the lat
ter contingency arising;, as In the pres
ent Instance, when the owner was
aboard. Nelson drove him from the
wharf to the bank, where he conferred
briefly, in an undertone, with Eugene
Madrlllon; after which Eugene sent a
noto containing three words to Tap
pingham Marsh. Marsh tore up the
note, and sauntered over to the club,
where he found General Trumble and
Jefferson Bareaud amicably discussing
a pitcher of cherry bounce.
"He has come." said Tappingham,
pleased to find the pair the only occu
pants of the place. "He saw Madrlllon,
and there's a session to-night."
"Praise the Lord!" exclaimed the
stout general, rising to his feet. "I'll
see old Chenoweth at once. My fingers
have the Itch."
"And mine, too." said Bareaud. "I'd
begun to think we'd never have a go
with him again.**
"You must see that Crailey comes.
We want a full table. Draff him. If
you can't get him any other way."
"He won't need urging," said Jeffer
son.
"But he cut us last time."
"He won't cut to-night. What hour?"
"Nine," answered Tappingham. "It's
to be a full sitting, remember."
"Don't fear for Ã¼b," laughed Trumble.
"Nor for Crailey, Jefferson added.
"After so long a vacation you couldn't
keep him away If you chained him to
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL!.
the courthouse pillars; he'd tear 'em
in two!"
"Here's to our better fortunes, then!"
said the old soldier, filling a glass for
Tappingham; and, "Here's to our bet
ter fortunes!" echoed the young men,
pouring off the gentle liquor heartily.
Having thvls made libation to their par
ticular god, the trio separated.
But Jefferson did not encounter the
alacrity of acceptance he expected from
Crailey, when he found him, half an
hour later, at the hotel bar. Indeed, at
first Mr. Gray not only refused out
right to go, but seriously urged the
same course upon Jefferson; moreover,
his remonstrance was offered in such
evident good faith that Bareaud, in the
act of swallo-vving one of his Jarge doses
of Quinine, paused with only half the
powder down his throat, gazing, non
plus*!, at his prospective brother-in
1 a w. I
"ftfy immortal soul!" he gasped. "Is
this Crailey Gray? What's the trou
ble?"
"Nothing," replied Crailey, quietly.
"Only don't go, you've lost enough."
"Well, you're a beautiful one!" Jeffer
son exclaimed, with an incredulous
laugh. "You're a master hand; you, to
talk about losing enough!"
"I know, I know," Crailey began,
shaking his head, "but â "
"You've promised Fanchon never to
go again, and you're afraid Miss Betty
will see or hear us, and tell her you
were there."
"I don't know Miss Carewe."
"Then you needn't fear; besides, she'll
be out when we come, and asleep when
we go. She will never know we've Â«een
in the house."
"That has nothing to do with It," said
Crailey, impatiently; and he was the
more earnest because he remembered
the dangerous geography of the Carewe
house, which made it impossible for
any one to leave the cupola-room except
by the lons hall which passed certain
doors. "I will not go, and what's more,
I promised Fanchon I'd try to keep you
out of it hereafter."
"Lord, but we're virtuous!" laughed
the Incredulous Jefferson, "fli come
for you at a quarter to nine."
"I will not go, I tell you."
Jefferson roared. "Yes, you will. You
couldn't keep from It if you tried!" And
he took himself off. laughing; violently,
again promising to call for Crailey on
his way to the tryst, and leaving him
still warmly protesting that it would be
a great folly for either of them to go.
Crailey looked after the lad's long,
thin figure with an expression as near
anger as he ever wore. "He'll go," he
said to himself.
"Andâ ah, wellâ l'll have to risk it!
I'll go with him, but only to try and
bring him away earlyâ that is, as early
as it's safe to be sure that f they are
asleep downstairs. And I won't play.
No, I'll not play: I'll not play."
He paid his score and went out of the
hotel by a side door. Some distance up
the street, Bareaud was still to be seen,
lounging- homeward in the pleasant af
ternoon sunshine, he stopped on a cor
ner and serenely poured another qui
nine powder Into himself and threw the
paper to a couple of pigs who looked up
from the gutter maliciously.
"Confound him!" said Crailey, laugh
ing ruefully. "He makes me a mission
aryâfor rll kee P my "word to Fanchon
in that, at least! I'll look after Jeffer
son to-night. Ah, I might as well be
old Tom Vanrevel, Indeed!" t
Meanwhile, Mr. Carewe had taken
possession of his own again. His
daughter ran to the door to meet him;
she was trembling * little, and, blush
ing and smiling, held out her hands to
.him, so that Mrs. Tanberry vowed this
was the loveliest creature In the world,
and the kindest.
Mr. Carewe bowed slightly, as to an
acquaintance, and disregarded the ex
tended hands.
At that, the blush faded from Miss
Betty's cheeks; she trembled no more,
and a salutation as icy as her father's
was returned to him. He bent his
heavy brows upon her, and shot a black
glance her pray, being, of course, imme
diately enraged by her reflection of his
own manner, but he did not speak to
her.
Nor did he once address her during
the evening meal, preferring to honor
Mrs. Tanberry with his conversation, to
that diplomatic lady's secret anger, but
outward amusement. She cheerfully
neglected to answer him at times, hav
ing not the slightest awe of him, and
turned to the girl instead; Indeed, she
was only prevented from rating him
soundly at his own table by the fear
that she might make the situation more
difficult for her young charge. As soon
as Ht was possible, she made her escape
with Miss Betty, and they drove away
in the twilight to pay visits of duty,
leaving Mr. Carewe frowning at his
coffee on the veranda.
When they came home, three hours
later, Miss Betty noticed that a fringe
of illumination bordered each of the
heavily curtained windows in the cupo
la, and she uttered an exclamation, for
she had never known that room to be
lighted.
"Look!" she cried, touching Mrs. Tan
berry'a arm, as the horses trotted
through the gates under a drizzle of
rain. "I thought the room in the cu
pola was empty. It's always locked,
and when I came from St. Mary's he
told me that old furniture was stored
there."
Mrs. Tanberry was grateful for the
darkness. "He may have gone there to
read," she answered, In a queer voice.
"Let us go quietly to bed, child, so as
not to diÃturb him."
Betty had as little desire to disturb
her father as she had to see him; there
fore she obeyed her friend's injunction,
and went tp her room on tiptoe. The
house was very silent as she lit the
candles on her bureau. Outside, the
gentle drizzle and the soothing; tinkle
from the eaves were the only sounds;
within, there was but the faint rustle
of garments from Mrs. Tanberry's
room. Presently the latter ceased to be
heard, and a wooden moan of protest
from tfce four-poster upon which the
good lady reposed announced that she
had drawn the curtains and wooed the
rulers of Nod.
Although it was one of those nights
of which they say, "It is a good night
to sleep," Miss Betty was not drowsy.
She had half unfastened one small
sandal, but she tied the ribbons again,
and seated herself by the open window.
The ledge and casement framed a dim
oblong of thin light from the candles
behind her, a lonely luster, which
crossed the veranda to melt shapelessly
Into darkness on the soggy lawn. She
felt a melancholy In the softly falling
rain and wet, black foliage that chimed
with the sadness of her own spirit. The
night suited her very well, far her
father's coming had brought a weight
of depression with it. Why could he
not have spoken one word to her, even
a cross one? She knew that he did not
love her, yet, merely as a fellow-being,
ghe was entitled to a measure of cour
tesy; and the fact tl*at she was his
daughter could not excuse his failure
to render It Was she to continue to
live with him on their present terms?
She had no intention to make another
effort to alter them; but to remain as
they were would be intolerable, and
Mrs. Tanberry could not stay forever,
to act as a buffer between her and her
father. Peering out into the dismal
night, she found her own future as
black, and it seemed no wonder that thÂ»
sisters loved the convent life; that the
pale nuns forsook the world wherein
there was so much useless unkindness;
where women were petty and Jealous,
like that cowardly Fanchon, and men
who looked great were tricksters, like
Fanchon's betrothed. Miss Betty
clenched her delicate singers. She
would not remember that white,
startled face again!
Another face helped her to shut out
the recollection; that of the man who
had come to mass to meet her yester
day morning, and with whom she had
taken a long walk afterward. He had
shown her a auaint old English gar
dener who lived on the bank of the
river, had bought her a bouquet, and
she had helped him to select another to
send to a sick friend. How beautiful
the flowers were, and how happy he
had made the morning; for her, with his
gayety, his lightness, and his odd wis
dom! Was it only yesterday? Her
father's coming had made yesterday a
fortnight old.
But the continuously pattering rain
and the soft drip-drop from the roof,
though as mournful as she chose to
find them, began, afterwhile, to weave
their somnolent spells, and she slowly
drifted from reveries of unhappy sorts,
into half-dreams, in which she was still
aware she was awake; yet slumber,
heavy-eyed, stirring from the curtains
beside her with the small night breeze,
breathed strange distortions upon fa
miliar things, and drowsy impossibil
ities moved upon the surface of her
thoughts. Her chin, resting upon her
hand, sank gently, until her head al
most lay upon her relaxed arms.
"That Is mine, Crailey Gray!"
She sprapg to her feet, immeasurably
startled, one hand clutching the back
of her chair, the other tremulously
pressed to her cheek, convinced that
her father had stooped over her and
shouted the sentence In her ear. For
it was his voice, and the house rang
with the words; all the rooms, halls,
and even the walls, seemed still mur
murous with the sudden sound, like the
tingling of a bell after it has been
struck. And yet â everything was quiet.
Bhe pressed her fingers to her fore
head, trying to untangle the maze of
dreams which had evolved this shock
for her. the sudden clamor in her
father's voice of a name she hated and
hoped never to hear again, a name she
was trying to forget. But as she was
unable to trace anything which had led
to it, there remained only the conclu
sion that her nerves were not what
they should be. The vapors having be
come obsolete for young ladies as an ex
planation for all unpleasant sensations,
they were instructed to have "nerves."
This was Miss Betty's first conscious
ness of her own, and, desiring no great
er acquaintance with them, she told
herself it was unwholesome to fall
"asleep in a chair by an open window
when the night was as sad as she.
Turning to a chair in front of the
small oval mirror of her bureau, she
unclasped the brooch which held her
lace collar, and, seating herself, began
to unfasten her hair. Suddenly she
paused, her uplifted arms falling me
chanically to her sides.
Boms one was coming 1 through the Ions;
ball with, a soft, almost Inaudible step,
a stop which was not her father*!. She
knew at once, with Instinctive certain
ty, that itVas not he. sior was It Nel
son, who would have shuffled; nor
could It be the vain Mamie, nor on* of
the other servants, for they did not
sleep in the house. It was a step more
like a woman's, though certainly It wig
not Mrs. Tanberry's.
Betty rose, took a candle, and stood
silent for a moment, the heavy tresses
of her hair, half unloosed, falling- upon
her neck and left shoulder Ilka the
folds of a dark drapery.
At the slight rustle of her rising-, the
steps ceased Instantly. Her heart set
up a wild beating and thÂ» candle shook
In her hand. But she was brave and
young*, and, following- an Irresistible Im
pulse, she ran across the room, flaasj
open the door, and threw thÂ« light of
the candle into the hall, holding It at
arm's length before her.
She came ' almost face to taoo jvtlli
Cralley Gray.

physically sick. For he need not have
been there; he had not wished to oema;
he had well counted the danger tÂ» him

gone to the cupola-room out of good

hoping- that < Jefferson might follow.

"I cameâ came â to bring another

and, at the very moment several heavy,
half-suppressed voices broke into eager
talk overhead.

tening keenly for the slightest Bound

"When I do I shall tell you; now I
only know that you must go'
'But tell me "
"Y'->u must go!"
ThÂ» --re was a shuffling of chairs on the
floor overhead, and Crailey went. He
Â¦went even more hastily than might
have been expected from the adaman
tine attitude he had just previously as
sumed. Realizing this as he reached
thr wet path, he risked stealing round
to her window:
' F'.r your sake! " he breathed; and
having thus forestalled any trifling im
tion which might arise in her
recollection of his exit from the house,
he disappeared, kissing his hand to the
rain as he ran down the street.
Â¦ Betty locked her door and pulled
rlope the curtains of her window. A
numerous but careful Bound of foot
steps came from the hall, went by her
door and out across the veranda. Si
lently she waited until she heard her
father go alone to his room.
Phe took the candle and went in to
Mrs. Tanberry. She set the light upon
a table, pulled a chair close to the bed-
Fide, and placed her cool hand lightly
on the great lady's forehead.
"Isn't it very late, child? Why are
you not asleep?"
'Mrs. Tanberry, I want to know why
there was a light in the cupola-room
to-night?"
'What?" Mrs. Tanberry rolled her
self as upright as possible, and sat with
blinking eyes.
"I want to know what I am sure you
know, and what I am sure everybody
knows, except me. What were they
doing there to-night, and what was the
quarrel between Mr. Vanrevel and my
father that had to do with Mr. Gray?"
Mrs. Tanberry gazed earnestly into
the girl's face. After a long time she
said in a gentle voice:
'Child, has it come to matter that
much? '
' Yrs ." said Miss Betty.
CHAPTER XIII.
THE TOCSIN.
T<-Â»m Vanrevel always went to the
office soon after the morning distribu
tion of the mail: that is to say, about
ten o'clock, and returned with the let
ters of the firm of Gray & Vanrev
el. both personal and official. Crailey
and he shared everything, even a box
at the postoffice; and in front of this
box. one morning, tfter a night of rain,
Tom stood staring at a white envelope
bearing a small, black Eeal. The ad
dress was in a writing he had never
seen before, but the instant it fell under
his eye he was struck with a distinctly
pleasurable excitement.
Whether through some spiritual ex
halation of the writer fragrant on any
missive, or because of a hundred mi
croscopi/: impressions, there- are an
alysts who" are able to select, from a
pile of letters written by women (for
the writing of women exhibits certain
phenomena' more determinably than
that of men) those of the prettiest or
otherwise most attractive. And out
upon the lover who does not recognize
his mistress's hand at the first glimpse
ever he has of it, without post mark or
other information to aid him! Thus
Vanrevel, worn, hollow-eyed, and sal
low, In the Rouen postoffice, held the
one letter separate from a dozen (the
latter not, indeed, from women), and
stared at it until a little color came
back to his dark skin and a great deal
of brightness to his eye. He was no
analyst of handwritings, yet it came
to him instantly that this note was
from a pretty woman. To see that it
was from a woman was simple, but
that he knewâ and he did knowâ that
she was pretty, savors of the occult.
More than this; there was something
about it that thrilled him. Suddenly,
and without reason, he knew that it
came from Elizabeth Care we.
He walked back quickly to his office
with the letter in the left pocket of his
coat, threw the bundle of general
correspondence upon his desk, went up
to the floor above, and paused at his
own door to listen. Deep breathing
from across the hall indicated that Mr.
Gray's soul was still encased in slum
ber, and great was its need, as Tom
had found his partner, that morning at
five, stretched upon the horse-hair sofa
in the office, lamenting the emptiness
of a bottle which had been filled with
fiery Bourbon in the afternoon.
Vanrevel went to his own room,
locked the door, and took the letter
from his pocket. He held it between
his fingers carefully, as though it were
alive and very fragile, and he looked at
it a long time, holding it first in one
hand, then in the other, before he
opened it. At last, however, after ex
amining all the blades of his pocket
knife, he selected one brighter than the
others, and loosened the flap of the en
velope as gently and carefully as if it
had been the petal of a rosebud that he
was opening. . /
'DEAR MR. VANREVEL: I. believed
you list night, though I did not under
stand. But I understand, now â every
thing â and, bitter to me as the truth is.
I must show you plainly that I know all
of It. nor can I rest until I do show you.
I want you. to answer this letter- â
though I must' not see you again for a
long â and in your answer you must
set me right if I am anywhere mistaken
in what I have learned.
'At first, and until after the second
time we met. I did not believe In your
heart, though I did in your mind and
humor. Even since then, there have
come strange, small; inexplicable mis
trusting of you, but now I throw them
all away and trust you wholly, Monsieur
Citizen Georges Meilhac! I shall always
think of you in those impossible gar
ishments of my poor greatuncle. and I
persuade myself that he must have been
a little like you.
"I trust you because I have heard the
story of your profound goodness. The
first' reason for my father's dislike was
your belief in freedom as the right of all
men. Ah. it is not your pretty exaggera
tions and flatteries (I laugh at them!)
that speak for you. 'but your career, it
self, and the brave things you have done.
My father's dislike flared into hatred be
cause you worsted him when lie dis
covered that he could not successfully
defend the wrong against you and foil
back upon sheer insult.
"He is a man whom I do not know â
strange as that seems as I write it. It
is only to you, who have taught me so
much, that I could write it. I have tried
to know him and to realize that I am his
daughter, but we are the coldest ac
quaintances, that is all; and I cannot see
how a change could come. I do not un
derstand him; least of all do I under
stand why he is a gambler. It has been
explained to me that it is his great pas
sion, but all I comprehend- in these
words is that they are full of shame for
his daughter. Â«
"This is what was told me; he has al
ways played heavily and skillfully â add
ing much to his estate in that wayâ and
in Rouen always with a certain coterie,
which was joined, several years ago, by.
the man you came to save last night.
"Your devotion to Mr. Gray has been
the most beautiful thing in your life. I
know all that the town knows of that,
except the thousand hidden sacrifices
you have made : for him. those things
which no one will ever know. (And yet,
you see, I know them after all!) For
your sake, because you love him, I will
not call him unworthy.
"I have heard â from one who told un
willinglythe story of the night two
years ago. when the play ran so terribly
high; and how, in the mornng when they
went away, all were poorer except one,
their host â how Mr. Gray had nothing
left In the world, and owed my father a
great sum which was to be paid in
twenty-four hours; how you took every
thing you had saved in the years of hard
work at your profession, and borrowed
the rest on your word, and brought it to
my father that afternoon; how, when
you had paid your friend's debt, you
asked my father not to play with Mr.
Gray again: and my father made that
his excuse to rend ypu a challenge. You
laughed at thÂ» challenge â and you could
afford to laugh at It.
"But this is all shame, shame for
Robert Carewe's daughter. It seems to
me that I should hide and not lift my
head; that I, being of my father's blood,
could never look you In the face again.
It is so unspeakably painful and ugly.
I think of my father's stiff pride and his
look of the eagle â and he still plays
with your friend, almost always 'suc
cessfully!' And your friend still comes
to â but I will not speak of that side
of It. .
"Mr. Gray has made you poor, but I
know it was not that which made you
come seeking him last night, when I
found you there In the hall.- It was for
his sake you â and you went away
for - mine. Now that I " know, at last â :
now that I have heard what your life
has been (and oh I heard so much more
than I have written) â now that my
eyes have been opened to see you as you
are. I am proud, and glad and humble
that I can believe that you felt a friend
ship for me strong enough to have made
you go 'for my take.' You 'will write to.
me just once, won't you? and tell me if
there was any error In what I listened
to; but you must not come to the gar
den. Now that I know you, I cannot
meet you clandestinely again. It would
hurt the dignity which I feel In you now.
and my own poor dignityâ such as it is!
I have been earnestly warned of the
danger to you. Besides, you must let
me test myself. I am all fluttering and
frightened and excited. : You will obey
me, won't you? â not come until I
send for you. .
"ELIZABETH CAREWE."
" Â¦ Mr. Gray, occupied with his toilet
about noon, heard his partner descend
ing to the office with a heavy step, and
issued . from : his room to call hearty
greeting. : Tom looked back over ', his
shoulder and replied cheerily, though
with a certain . embarrassment; but

down to him. /]'. .-..-â¢': "Â¦.'"...'Â¦"' i
"Why, what's the matter, Tom?
Ycu're hot going to be sick? ;, You look
like the devil and all!"
"I'm : all right, never fear!" Tom
laughed, evading the other's eye. "I'm
going out in the country on some busi
ness, and I dare say I shall ; not be back
for a couple of ; days; it will be all up
and down the country." He se\down a
travelling-bag" he was carrying, ' and
offered the other his hand. "Good-by."
"Can't I go for you? You don't look
ableâ" Â¦ , /. . ' \\ , \ : -. ;Â¦Â¦
"No, no. It's something I'll have to
attend to myself." Â
"Ah, I suppose." said Crailey, gently,
"I suppose it's important, and you
couldn't ' trust me to handle it. Well-
God knows you're v right ! I've ! shown ',
you often enough how Incompetent "I;
am to do anything but A write jingles!" ,
"You do some more of themâ without
the ;. whisky, . Crailey. - They're worth
more than all the lawing Gray &
Vanrevel have 'ever" done or ever will [
do. Good-by â be kind to yourself."
â¢ He descended to the first ' landing,
and then, "Oh, Crailey," he called, with
the air of having forgotten something
he had meant to say.
"Yes, Tom?"
. "This morning at the postoffice I
found a letter addressed to me. I
opened it and â " He hesitated, and un
easily shifted his weight from one foot
to the other, with a feeble, deprecatory
la^h.
"Yes, what of it?"
"Wellâ there seemed to be a mistake.
I think it must have been meant for
you. Somehow, she â she's picked up
a good many wrong impressions, and,
Lord knows how, but ; she's mixed â¢ our
names up and â and I've left the letter
for you. It's on my table."
He turned and calling a final good
by over his shoulder, w^ent clattering
noisily down to the street arid ;~ van
ished from Crailey's sight. ; ;
Noon found Tom far out on the Na
tional Road, creaking along over the
yellow dust in \ a light wagon,'! between
bordering forests that smelt i ; spicily of j
wet underbrush and May apples; and,
here and there, _ when they would
emerge from the woods to cleared fields,
liberally outlined by long snake fences
of black walnut, the steady, Jog-trot
ting old horse lifted his head and looked
interested in the world, but Tom never
did either. Habitually upright, j walk
ing or sitting, straight, keen, arid alert,
that ;_ day's sun saw him : drearily
hunched over, mile after mile, his fore
head laced with lines of pain. He
stopped at every farm house and cabin,
and, where the young men worked in
the fields, hailed them from the road,
or hitched his horse to ' the fence and
crossed, the soft furrows to talk with
them. At such times he stood erect .
again, and spoke stirringly, fifiding
eager listeners. There was one ques
tion they asked him over arid over: ;;>*'.
"But' are you. sure the call will
come?" -r; % '-.Â¦-'-Â¦" | *^;V,
"As sure as that we stand here; and
it will come before the week is out. We
must be ready!" Â¦.Â¦ < ?'' :
Often, when he left them, they would
turn from the work in f hand, leaving It
as it was, to lie unfinished in the fields,
and make their .way slowly and
thoughtfully to their homes, while Tom
climbed into his creaking little wagon
once more, only to fall into the same
dull, hunched-over attitude. He had
many things to think out before he
faced Rouen and Crailey Gray again,
and more to fight through to the end
with himself. Three days he took for It,
three days driving through 'Â¦ the soft
May weather behind the kind, old jog
trotting horse; three days on the road,
from farm house to farm house and
from field to field, from . cabin of the
woods to cabin in the clearing. Toss
ing unhappily at night, he lay sleepless
till dawn, though not because of the
hard beds; and when daylight came,
journeyed steadily on again, over the
vagabond little hills that had gypsled it
so far Into the prairie-land in their
wanderings from their range on the
Ohio, and. passing the hills, went on
through the . flat forest land, always
hunched over dismally in the creaking
wagon. . ;
But on the evening of the third. day
he drove into town, with the stoop out
of his shoulders and the luster back In
his eyes. He was haggard, gray, dusty,
but he had solved his puzzle, and one
thing was clear in his mind as the
thing that he would do. He patted the
old horse a hearty - farewell : as he left
him with the liveryman from whom he :
had hired him, and strode up Main
street with the air of a man who is
going somewhere. It was late, but
there :: were more j lights than : usual in
the windows .and more \ people on the
streets. Boys ran shoutilng, while, here
and there, knots of men argued loudly,
and in front of the little corner drug
store a noisily talkative, "widely ges
ticulatlve crowd jof fifty :or more had \
gathered. ,An old man, a cobbler, who :
had left a leg \ at Tippecanoe and re- j
placed It with a * wooden one, chastely
decorated with designs of his own carv
ing, came stumping excitedly down the
middle of the street, where he walked
for fear of the cracks In the wooden
pavement/ which were dangerous to his
art leg when ,he came ; from the ; Rouen
House bar, as on the present occasion.
He hailed Tom by name. Â¦ â¢
"Youre r the lad, Tom Vanrevel," he
shouted. "You're the Â¦ man to lead the
boys out for the glory of the State! Â¦
You git the whole blame Fire Depart
ment out : and enlirt ' 'em \ before , morn
ing! Take 'em down to the R4o Grande,
you- hear' me? And " you " needn't \be
afraid of ' their \ puttin* : it out, if it
ketches afire, neither!"
' Tom waved his hand and passed on; ;
but : at , the open I doors .of â¢> the . Catholic
church â¢ he : stopped '-- and } looked up and
down the street, and then, 7 unnoticed.
entered to the dim interior, where the
few candles showed only a bent old
woman in black kneeling at the altar.
Tom knew where Elizabeth Carewe
knelt each morning; he stepped softly
through the shadowy silence to her
place, knelt, and rested his head upon
the rail of the bench before him.
The flKure at the aitar raised itself
after a time, and the old woman limped
Blowly up a side aisle, mumbling her
formulas, courtesying to the painted
saints, on her way out. The very thin
est Hngerings of incense hung on the
air, seeming to Term like the faint odor
that might exhale from a heavy wreath
of marguerites, worn in dark brown
hair. Yet, the place held nothing but
peace and good-will. And he found
nothing else in his own heart.
The street was quiet when he
emerged from that lorn vigil; the cor
ner groups had dissolved; shouting
youths no longer patrolled the side
walks. Only one quarter showed signs
of life; the llt,tle club house, where the
windows still shone brightly, and
whence came the sound of many voices
settling the destinies of the United
States of America. Thither Tom bent
his steps thoughtfully, and with a
quiet mind. There was a small veran
da at the side of the house; here he
stood unobserved to look in upon his
noisy and agitated friends.
They were all there, from the old gen
eral and Mr. Bareaud, to the latter's
son, Jefferson, and young Frank Cheno
weth. They were gathered about a big
table upon which stood a punch bowl,
and Trumble, his brow as angry red as
the liquor in the cup he held, was pro
posing a health to the President in a
voice of fury. Â»
"In spite of all the Crailey Grays and
traitors this side of hell!" he finished
politely.
Crailey emerged instantaneously from
the general throng and mounted a
chair, tossing his light hair, back from
his forehead, his eyes sparkling and
happy. "You find your own friends
already occupying the place you men
tioned, do you, General?" he asked.
General Trumble stamped and shook
his fist. "You're a spawn of Aaron
Burr!" he vociferated. "There's not a
man here to stand by your Infernal
doctrines. You sneer at your own State,
you sneer at your own country, you de
file the sacred ground! What are you,
by the Almighty, who attack your na
tive land in this, her hour of peril!"
"Peril to my native land!" laughed
Crailey. "From Santa Anna?"
"The general's right, sir," exclaimed
the elder Chenoweth Indignantly, and
most of the listeners appeared to agree
with him. "It's a poor time to abuse
the President when he's called for vol
unteers and our country is in danger,
sir!"
"Who Is In danger?" answered Crai
ley, lifting his hand to still the clamor
of approbation that arose. "Is Polk In
danger? Or Congress? But that would
be too much to hope! Do you expect to
pee the Greasers In Washington? No.
you idiots, you don't! Yet there'll be
plenty of men to suffer and die; and the
first should be those who thrust this
war on us and poor little Mexico; but
It won't be they; and men who'll do
the fighting and dying will be the coun
try boys and the like of us from the
towns, while Mr. Polk sits planning at
tri? White House how he can get elected
again. I wish Tom were here, confound
you! You listen to him, because he al
ways has the facts and I'm just an em
broiderer, you tMnk. What's become
of the gaudy campaign cry you were
all wearing your lungs out with a few
months ago? 'Fifty-four-forty or fight!'
Bah! Polk twisted the lion's tail with
that until after election. Then he saw
he had to make you forget It, or fight
England ani be ruined, so he forces
war on Mexico, "and the country does
forget it. That's it; he asks three regi
ments of volunteers from this State to
die of fevers and get shot, so that he
can steal another country and make
his own elect him again. And you ask
me to drink the health of the politician
who sits at home and sends his fellow
men to die to fix his rotten jobs for
him?" Crailey had persuaded himself
into such earnestness, that the depth
of his own feeling almost choked him,
but he finished roundly In his beauti
ful, strong voice: "I'll drink for the
good punch's sake â but that health?â
I'll see General Trumble in heaven be
fore I'll drink it!"
There arose at once a roar of anger
and disapproval, and Crailey became a
mere storm center amid the upraised
hands gesticulating madly at him as
he stood, smiling again, upon his chair.
"This comes of living with Tom Van
revel!" shouted the general furiously.
"This is his damned abolition teaching!
You're only his echo; you spend half
your life playing at being Vanrevel!",
"Where is Vanrevel?" said Tapping
ham March.
"Ay, where Is he!" raged Trumble,
hammering the table till the gtesses
rang. "Let him come and answer for
his own teaching; it's wasted time to
talk to this one; he's only the pupil.
Where Is the traitor?"
"Here," answered a voice from the
doorway; and though the word was
spoken quietly it was, nevertheless, at
that juncture, silencing. Every one
turned toward the door as Vanrevel
entered. But the apoplectic general,
whom Cralley's speech had stirred to a
fury beyond control, almost leaped at
Tom's throat.
"Here's the tea-sipping old granny,"
he bellowed hoarsely. (He was ordi
narily very fond of Tom.) "Here's the
master! Here's the man whose example
teaches Crailey Gray to throw mud at
the flag. He'll stay here at home with
Crailey, of course, and throw more,
while the other boys march out to die
under It."
"On the contrary. General," answered
Tom, raising his voice, "I think you'll
find Crailey Gray the first to enlist, and
as for myself, I've raised sixty men in
the county, and I want forty more
from Rouen, In order to offer the Gov
ernor a full company. So it's come to
'the King, not the man'; Poljc is a piti
ful trickster, but the country needs her
sons; that's enough for us to know; and
while I won't drink to James Polk"â he
plunged a cup In the bowl and drew it
out brimmingâ "I'll empty this to the
President!"
It was then that from fifty throats
the long, wild shout went up that
stirred Rouen, and woke the people
from their midnight beds for half a
mile around.
CHAPTER XIV.
THE FIRM OF GRAY & VANREVEL.
For the first time It was Crailey who
sat waiting for Tom to come home. In
a chair drawn to his partner's desk in
the dusty office, he half-reclined, arms
on the desk, his chin on his clenched
fists. To redeem the gloom he had lit a
single candle, which painted him dimly
against the complete darkness of his
own shadow, like a very old portrait
whose background time has solidified
into shapeless browns; the portrait
of a falr-halred gentleman, the cava
lier, or the Marquis, one might have
said at first glance; not describing it
immediately as that of a poet, for there
was no mark of art upon Crailey, not
even in his hair, for they all wore It
rather long then. Yet there was a
mark upon him, never more vivid than
as he sat waiting in the loneliness of
that night for Tom Vanrevel; though
what the mark was and what its sig
nificance might have been puzzling to
define. Perhaps, after all, Fanchon
Bareaud had described It best when she
told Crailey one day, with a sudden
hint of apprehensive tears, that he had
a "look of fate."
Tom took his own time In coming;
he had stayed at the club to go over
his listsâ so he had told Craileyâ with
the general and old Bareaud. His
company was almost complete, and
Crailey had been the first to volunteer,
to the dumfoundlng of Trumble, who
had proceeded to drink his health again
and again. But the lists could not de
tain Tom two hours, Crailey knew, and
it was two hours since the new volun
teers had sung the "Star-Spangled
Banner" over the last of the punch,
and had left the club to Tom and the
two old men. Only once or twice in
that time had Crailey shifted his posi
tion, or altered the direction of his set
gaze at nothing. But at last he rose,
went to the window and, leaning far
out. looked down the street toward the
little clubhouse. Its lights were extin
guished and all was dark up and down
the street. Abruptly Crailey went
back to the desk and blew out the can
dle, after which he sat down again in
the same position. Twenty minutes
later he heard Tom's step on the stair,
coming up very softly. Crailey waited
In silence until his partner reached the
landing, then he relit the candle.
"Tom." he called. "Come In, please,
I've been waiting for you."
There was a pause before Tom an
swered from the hall:
"I'm very tired, Crailey. I think I'll
go up to bed."
"No," said Crailey, "come In."
The door was already open, but Tom
turned toward" it reluctantly. He
stopped at the threshold and the two
looked at each other.
"I thought you wouldn't come as long
as you believed I was up." said Cralley,
"so I blew out the light. I'm sorry I
kept you outside so long."
"Crailey, I'm going away to-mor
row," the other began. "I am to go
over and see the Governor and offer
him this company, and to-night I need
sleep, so please "
"No," interrupted Crailey quietly, "I
want to know what you are going to
do."
"To do about what?"
"About me."
"Oh!" Tom's face fell at once from
his friend's face and rested upon the
floor. Slowly he walked to the desk
and stood In embarrassed contempla
tion of the littered books and papers,
while the other waited.
"i think it Is best for you to tell me,"
said Crailey.
"You think so?" Tom's embarrass
ment increased visibly, and there was
mingled with it an odd appearance of
apprehension, probably to relieve
which he very deliberately took two
long cheroots from his pocket, laid one
on the desk for Crailey and lit the
other himself, with extreme carefulness,
at the candle. After this ceremonial
he dragged a chair to the window,
tilted back in It with his feet on the low
sill, his back to the thin light and his
friend, and said in a slow, gentle tone:
"Well, Crailey?"
"I suppose you mean that I ought to
offer my explanation first," said the
other, still standing. "Well, there Isn't
any." He did not speak doggedly or
sullenly, as one In fault, but more with
the air of a man curiously ready to
throw all possible light upon a cloudy
phenomenon. "It's very simple â all that
I know about. I went there first on the
evening of the Madrillon masquerade
and played a lfttle comedy for her, so
that some of my theatrical allusionsâ
they weren't very illuminating! â to my
engagement to Fanchon, made her be

told her about the pair of us. I dis
covered that the night his warehouses
burned â and I saw something more,
because I can't help seeing such things;
that yours was just the character to
appeal to a young girl fresh from the
convent, and full of honesty and fine
dreams and fire. Nobody could arrange
a more fatal fascination for a girl of
nineteen than to have a deadly quarrel
with her father. And that's especially
true when the father's like that mad
brute of a Bob Carewe! Then,
you're more or less the town model d
virtue and popular hero, in spite

scamp. So I let it go on, and playew Â¦

you and I would mention the go
appearance of people we both meet
about town. But you needn't tell me
that it can't last much longer. Some
petty, unexpected trltte will turn
course. All that I want tv know is
what you mean to do."
"To do?" repeated Tom softly, and
blew a long scarf of smoke out of the
window.
"Ah!" Crailey's voice grew sharp
and loud. "There are many things you I
needn't tell me! You need not tell me
what IvÂ« done to youâ nor wha'
think of me! You need not tell me
that you have others to consider; that
you have Miss Carewe to think nf.
Don't you suppose I know that? And
you need not tell me that you have a
duty to Fanchon "
"Yes." Term broke in, his tone not
quite steady. "Yes, I've thought of
that."
"Well?"
"Have you â did youâ" he hesitated.
but Crailey understood immediately.
"No; I haven't seen her again."
"But you "
"Yes â I wrote. I answered the let
ter."
"Yes; I signed your name. I told you
that I had Just let things go on," Crai
ley answered, with an impatient move
ment of his hands. "What are you go
ing to do?"
"I'm going over to see the Governor
In the morning. I'lr be away two or
three days, I imagine."
"Vanrevel!" exclaimed Crailey hotly.
"Will you give me an answer and not
beat about the bush any longer? <">r
do you mean that you refuse to an
swer?"
Tom dropped his cigar upon the brick
window-ledge with an abysmal sigh.
"Oh, no, It Isn't that," he answered
mildly. "I've been thinking it all over
for three days in the country, ami
when I got back to-night I found that I
I had come to a decision without I
lnr It, and that I had come to It even
before I started; my leaving the letter
for you proved it. It's a little Ik
Mexican war, a mixed-up problem and
only one thing clear. A few schemer?
have led the country into it to in
crease the slave power and make us
forget that we threatened England
when we couldn't carry out the threat.
And yet If you look at It broadly, these
are the smaller things and they do not
last. The means by which the country
grows may be wrong, but Its growth is
right; It is only destiny, working out
through lies and blood, but the end will
be good. It Is bound to happen and
you can't stop It. I believe the m*Â»n
who make this war for their own uses
â¢will suffer in* hell fire for it; butsit is
made, and there's only one thing I can
see as the thing for me to do. They've
called me every name on carth â and the
same with you, too. Crailey â because
I'm an abolitionist, but now, whether
the country has sinned or not, a good
many thousand men have got to do the
bleeding for her, and I want to be one
of them. That's the one thing that Is
plain to me."
"Yes," returned Crailey. "You know
I'm with you; and I think You're al
ways right. Yes; we'll all be on the
way in a fortnight or so. Do you mean
you won't quarrel with me hecause of
that? Do you mean It would be a poor
time now, when we're all going out to
take our chances together?"
"Quarrel with you!" Tom rose and
came to the desk, looking across It at
his friend. "Did you think I might do
that?"
"Yes â I thought so."
"Crailey!" And now Tom's expression
showed desperation; it was that of a
man whose apprehensions have culmi
nated and who Is forced to face a crisis
long expected, long averted, but immi
nent at last. His eyes fell from Crai
ley's clear gaze and his hand fidgeted
among the papers on the desk.
"No." he began with a painful lame
ness and hesitation. "I did not mean
Itâ no; I meant, that. In the same way,
only one thing In this otherâ this other
affair that seems so confused and is
such a problem â only one thing has
grown clear. It doesn't seem to me
thatâ thatâ " here he drew a deep
breath, before he went on with increas
ing nervousness â "that If you like a
man and have lived with him a good
many years; that is to say. If you're
really much of a friend to him, I don't
believe you sit on a high seat and Judge
him. Judging, and all that, haven't
much part in it. And It seems to me
that you've got yourself into a pretty
bad mlx-up, Crailey."
"Yes," said Crailey. "I. s pretty
bad."
"Well." Tom looked up now, with an
almost tremulous smile, "I believe that
is about all I can make of It. Do you
think it's the part of your best friend
to expose you? It seems to me that if
there ever was a time when I ought to
stand by you, it's now."
There was a silence while they looked
at each other across the desk in the
faint light. Tom's eyes fell again as
Crailey opened his lips.
"And In spite of everything," Crailey
said breathlessly, "you mean that you
won't tell?"
"How could I, Crailey?" said Tom
Vanrevel as he turned away.
(Continued Next Sunday.)
)IN THE HOSPITAL
HE man sitting in the
darkened room at the
hospital raised his
bandaged eyes as the
nurse entered. The
month that he had
been there had not
served to chance the
i I-11I -11 tf.HtV'V.'l*
natiit of sight fixed by all the years
that liad jronc before.
"li> for -r.ieht. isn't it. Miss
Lee?" he cried, recognizing her steD:
"to-night I'll get rid of these con
founded bandages and see the licht of
day once more. Oh, you don't know
how this month has dragged. It's for
to-night, isn't it?"
"I believe ho," returned the nurse
gently. "But of course the doctor
will have to decide. He'll be here
soon." ,
"Gad: How plad I'll* be to see once
more:" cried the man. "I never could
have stood it even for a month if it
hadn't been for you. You've been an
angel to me."
The nurse blushed softly and cast
a very tender look at the man. She
answered merrily, "All the nurses here
â¢would have been the same. Nine pa
tients out of ten think we are aneels
â while they are in the hospital. They
chanpe their minds, afterward."
"I never shall. Do you know, after
Mil, despite all the pain and the anxiety,
I am glad this thing happened."
"Why?"
"Because it has enabled me to know
you. Oh, of course, I have known
you to speak to for months, and by
sight for years, but that isn't knowing
how tender, how sweet, how long suf
fer: you could be. Oh, Miss Lee â
Gertrude â "
"Hush: The doctor Â«aid you must
keep cool, you know. Excitement
might injure your eyes."
The man sank back into his chair,
"True." he said slowly, "I forgot that
I haven't any right to speak now; I
forget that the result of this operation
isn't absolutely certain and that I may
be blind â good God', blind â and that.
in any case, I rmist mend my fortunes
before â there, Is that the doctor
coming?"
The nurse glanced out of the open
floor Into the hall. "Yes," she said,
"he's Just down the corridor a-ways.

position right away, are you. Mr.
THE Rev. Mr. DINSMORE

CROGGSFIELD was
to have a new minis
ter. The whole, vil
lage was Interested,
for, although there
were several churches
In the little hamlet.
;>^^^|
thjs was the first new minister to ap
pear In a -whole generation.
The deacons* committee had di
vided on the subject, some favoring a
young man and some an older and
wiser head, but Brother Williams had
turned the scale by threatening to
withdraw his subscription unless a
-â¢and "progressive" man should
be called.
Accordingly, after much lobbying
on the part of the Ladies' Aid Soci
ety. it was announced that the Rev.
Mr. Dinsmore. a young student of di
vinity, had been' selected, and that he
would occupy the pulpit on the fol
lowing Sunday.
Sunday morning came, and, aa the
new minister had not yet put In an
.appearance, the village was on the
alert. He would surely come that
day.
They were not disappointed. When
the 1:10 train pulled Into the depot
a stranger stepped out and presented
himself at the ticket window.
He was a most affable young man
and was jauntily dressed.
"Good morning!" he said, and he
pet such an emphasis on the first
word that it sounded almost like a
chant.
Miss Williams,, the operator, looked
up from her lunch and quickly slipped
a half-eaten Â«ctt .Into her apron
pocket.
"Can you tell me. madam," said the
gentleman, smiling, 'â¢everything I
want to know about this historic and
progress*â¢ city of Scroggsfield?"
"I â I â yes. I think so. if
yon please, sir," she stammered, quite
overcome.
â¢Well, that's lucky for me," the
stranger exclaimed enthusiastically. ,
-Now, if you will," he continued, "Just
tell me where the new church la locat
ed, and. I swear, I'll remember you In
my dally prayers."
The operator had begun to resent his
manner, but now she understood. It
was the new minister.
"It's on South Main streetâ the
church is."' she said, "right next to
Farnham's drug store and hat empo
rium. But mebby you'd better go down
to our house and see paw. He's on the
deacons' committee and can tell you
anything you want to know."
"Thanks." replied the affable stran
per, pushing his Panama on the
back of his head and winking boldy at
the bashed and flustered girl. "P'raps
I will call, but not 'specially when your
pa's at home. Oh. by the way, Miss
-, Miss â â '-."
He waited.
â¢Williams." she said.
"Ah, Miss Williams. Well, now. Miss
Williams, tell your pa I'll meet the
committee at the church this evening
at 5. That's a good girl. Thanks. Now.
Where's .the hotel?" wil
Miss Williams looked askance. "The
Temperance House is right across from
the church." she said. _â¢
The stranger gulped hard and went
Within five minutes the deacon's
daughter ad managed to get the word
to her folks, and the village soon knew
that the new minister was in town.
When Deacon Williams started
around to tell the rest of the commit
tee he met the indignant president of
the Ladies' Aid Society upon his door-
Bt " What kind of a man is this young
Dinsmore?" she demanded. If ne
preaches to-morrow you can drop my
name from the subscription list.
The deacon stared blandly.
"He's been throwing kisses at my
daughter from the balcony of the
Pcott? You oughtn't to try your eyes
fcr a year or po. you know."
' I suppose not. But needs must, you
know, when a certain gentleman
drives. I'll be dead broke when I get

work. Ah! There's the doctor."
The doctor entered and stood for a
few moments talking to the man.
"Yes," he said, at last, "we'll take the
- off to-night. I think."
Thank Go.i: And â and there's no
that everything will be ail right,
re. doctor T*"
"We'll have for the best," returned
the doctor rheorily. his tone a very
comfort in itself, although his words
not especially 80. He passed out
of the door hurriedly, preventing fur
ther questions, -and beckoning to the
nurse as he did so to follow him. A few
'own the corridor he halted.
"Nurse. '^ he said with a worried look
on his face, "do you know whether
your patient has any relatives near
l,y?"
"I'm sure he has not." answered the
pirl readily. "I've talked with him re
peatedly and learned ajl about him. He
doesn't seem to have a relative in the
world."
The doctor's face grew graver. "How
is he off for money?"
"He just told me that he would be
"dead broke" when he got out of here.
He said he must at^once go back to
work."
"Back to work at once: He'll be
lucky if he ever gets to work again."
The nurse grew white. "Why?" she
gasped. "I thought the operation was
a certainty."
"A certainty: Yes. it is a certainty
almost â but in the wrong direction.
There isn't one chance in a hundred
that he'll ever see again."
With a mighty effort the nurse mas
tered her emotion. "But. doctor," she
gasped, "what will become of him?"
"Beoosaa of him?" echoed the doctor,
irritably. "Become of him? What be
comes of blind men who have no friends
and no money? We'll keep him as long
as we can. and then I suppose he'll
have to bo to the poorhouse for the
rest of his life."
A flush of anger succeeded the pallor
of Miss Lee's face. '"Why have you
deceived him?" she demanded indig
nantly, with utter disregard of the re
quirements of discipline. "He is sure
that he will get well. He is building on
it absolutely. If ho doesn't" â
The doctor looked curiously at the
Grandview Hotel," she continued,
"and, what's more, she's been throw
ing them back."
The deacon looked pained, and re
fused to believe It; but, at the first cor
ner, he was stopped by the village post
master.
"Huh!" says he, "that's a nice kind
of a minister you've picked up. He's
jes" won five dollars off Barney Miller
on a dog fight."
The deacon turned to go.
"He says he'll Bave that church from
bein' struck off the face of the airth
with a thunderbolt," called the post
master.
"They told me Rev. Mr. Dinsmore bad
original methods," mused the deacon,
"but bettin' on dog fights an' sparkin'
with the girls in public's too original."
At Brother Andrew's he met three
members of the LaSies' Aid Society,
all talking at once. From the medley
of voices he learned that the new min
ister had been seen to drink five whis
ky high-balls within a half-hour; that
he had tipped the barber ten cents and
that he had asked the buxom widow
Carewe to go driving with him.
The ladies were still talking when the
good deacon made his escape and set
out for the house of another commit
teeman, whither Brother Andrews had
already preceded him.
The brethren met him with reproach
ful silence. Brother Andrews was the
first to speak.
"Well, deacon," he said, "you see
what your progresslveness has come to."
The deaoon shook his head In solemn
self-reproach. "Well, Brother An
drews." he said finally, "I'm afraid this
young Dinsmore's too progressive for
Scroggsfleld, but we'll have a chance
to sound him. He's asked me to gather
the committee at the church this after
noon. That's what I came around for."
The three old deacons started sol
emnly off for the church. In the street
there was a great commotion, as two
teams went dashing up and down the
main thoroughfare, neck and neck, the
drivers hallooing in lusty tones and
brandishing their whips.
As the foremost team passed the
three deacons Brother Andrews recog
nised the widow Carewe, smiling gayly
from her place beside the dauntless
Dinamore. In another Instant the
sporting parson had turned his horses
and was drawing up at the church
door.
"Hal" he exclaimed, slapping the dea
â¢ cons one by one upon the shoulder,
"I'm Just in time, I see. Fine church
this"â he waved his hand affably.
"Come in, come in; I'll not detain you
but a minute." and he led the way into
the little anteroom, where the rest of
the committee sat awaiting an oppor
tunity to pass on Rev. Mr. Dlnsmore.
"Now, gentlemen," he said, turning
and shifting his hat to the back of his
head, "I called you out here to talk to
you about the salvation of this churoh.
I tell you, gentlemen, you're to be
commended and congratulated in hav
ing built so fine an edifice to the glory
of Scroggsfleld, But, I tell you, gen
tlemen, you've built this church in de
fiance of eternal laws â laws that are
not to be defied by man. I wonder,
gentlemen, that our magnificent build
ing hasn't been struck down by a
thunderbolt from heaven. I "
A meek mannered stranger, wearing
thick glasses and carrying a badly
scuffed gripsack, had entered the door
and was approaching timidly. The
speaker stopped in the midst of his
harangue and the newcomer stood
looking from one to another.
"I am the Rev. Mr. Dlnsmore," he
said apologetically; "can you tell
me "
"What!" cried the six, starting to
their feet.
"Dinsmore," said the stranger
faintly.
"Then who are you?" demanded
Deacon Williams of the .first stranger.
"I beg your pardon, gentlemen â my
card." and the speaker graciously pre
sented one to each of the committee.
" 'J. P. Rowser, Esquire,' " he went
on. proudly, "representing the great
est lightning rod establishment in the
world. I tell you, gentlemen, your
magnificent building is in eternal dan

came over him. He sighed; he was
an old man. but not a callous one. "If
you want him to see again, Miss Lee,"
he said, "be sure to keep him thinking
so. In that lies his one chance. Keep

nurse slowly retraced her steps to

AS ONE OF THE FAMILY
James K. Hearne
(Copyright, 1904, by M. Wood.)
*Btf*SÃfeii
VERTBODT 1 n
Greenville regarded
Manning as "one of
the family." HÂ«
was the confidant,
adviser and friend
of man, woman and
child, from old
Grandfather Pennel (who declared him-
Ben to oe a nunarea ana two, though he
was born In 1817) to little Robert Sefton
Browne, who had arrived In Greenville
only three months before, under the
guldano* of a friendly stork.
On envelopes and billheads he was
"Mr. William Manning-." At all other
times he was "Bill," or "Uncle Bill,"
according to the age of the speaker.
Manninr had no particular business to
ooupy his time. His father had left
him an Independent income, and he had
only the affairs of others In which to
take an Interest. It was the universal
ity of his knowledge that made him so
good an adviser; he could Indulge both
sides instead of only one.
This had continued for some years,
when suddenly Miss Amanda Penrose
came to Greenville. She was a distant
cousin of Grandfather Pennel's step
daughter, and this she considered suffi
cient reason why the Pennels should
take her under their roof tree. Mrs.
Pennel 111 declared hotly that consider
ing the fact that Lillian Douglas, who
had been the daughter of Pennel's sec
oftd wife by her first husband, had been
dead for three years. Miss Penrose had
no right to claim relationship.
Grandfather Pennel smiled amiably
at the disputants, but In the end always
decided in favor of Miss Amanda, in
clined thereto by the fact that she was
willing to admit that he was a hundred
and two, even though she knew better.
In the course of time the pitched bat
tles between Susan Pennel and Miss
Amanda ceased. Miss Amanda, silent
and smiling, was far too much for
blunt, outspoken Susan. In the end she
bowed her head to the affliction and
suffered, if not In silence, at least with
out direct opposition to the intruder.
Having gained her victory Miss
Amanda unwisely proceeded to make
life aa unbearable to Susan as pos
sible only to a woman. In a short
while Miss Amanda had driven Susan
to revolt.
She sought out Manning and found
in him a ready sympathizer. He was
already beginning to feel that this
assertive spinster threatened his do
main. She had subdued the family
of Pennel. and from certain little In
dications it seemed to him that she
thought to dominate the domestic af
faire of the rest of the village.
"I wouldn't complain," said the
weeeping Mrs. Pennel, "but you see,
William, you're like one of the family,
and I feel that I must tell some one."
"That's all right, Susan," he said,
cheerily. "I'll look In in the morning
and see what can be done."
She took her departure, still snif
fling, but visibly comforted. Manning
sat down to look over the situation.
Here he met a foeman worthy of his
steel. From all accounts she was
energetic, resourceful, somewhat dom
ineering, but for all that well balanced
and alert. It appealed to Manning
as a case of strategy.
He decided that it would be wise
to first ascertain the position of the
enemy, observing the probable force
he would have to encounter. He put
on his hat and strolled over to
Grandfather Pennel's for dinner. He
Â¦/as used to dropping in anywhere for
dinner. Miss Amanda met him at the
door, for Susan had not returned. She
was somewhat flushed, for she had
been arguing with Grandfather Pen
nel, who insisted that the War of 1813
did not happen, since he did not re
member it. He had figured that he
must have been ten or eleven years
old at the time and could not under
stand how soch a war had been fought
without his finding It out. Ordinarily
Miss Amanda was discreet and
waived disputed points, but her an
cestors had fought in the War of 1812
and she would not admit even to
Grandfather Pennel that it had not
occurred.
She was rather flustered at finding
Manning on the doorstep. She had
heard much about him, and In a way
feared his control of public opinion.
Manning had not regarded her" very
closely heretofore. Now he scrutinized
her very carefully as he handed her
his hat and prepared to enter the sit
ting-room. She was a more attractive
woman than he had supposed, he ad
mitted to himself. The heat of the ar
gument had left a pretty flush upon
the withered cheeks, and even Susan
would have admitted that she had
good eyes.
Manning soothed Grandfather Pennel
by assuring him that he remembered
the old gentleman telling about the
war of 1812 years ago, and suggesting
that he had probably forgotten all
about It. This was an adjustment sat
isfactory to both sides and gave Miss
Amanda a respect for his skill as an
arbitrator. Having settled the old man
Manning turned his attention to his
prospective foe.
She had been a school teacher in her
younger days and was better read than
the average. She was a fluent talker
as well. Manning was almost sorry
when dinner was announced, even
though Susan Pennel's dumplings were
supposed to Improve any chicken stew
ever made.
After that he found that an opponent
required more study than he had sup
posed. He was regularly at the Pen
nels; so regularly that at length Susan
took him to task. It was over at his
home, and he sat in the cozy arm chair
where he had heard the confessions of
half the village.
"I don't like to speak of it, William,"
she was saying nervously. "I don't
suppose I had any right in the first
place to ask you to get that woman out
of the house, but you see you're like
one of the family, and I thought you
might help me."
"Amanda's a mighty fine woman,
Susan," he answered, nervously pick-
Ing at a loose button on the chair arm,
"a mighty fine woman, but you see
she's never had any husband to domi
neer. You can't blame her when you
realise that, you know. Now I think
the best wav will be to get a husband
for her."
Susan sniffed. "You don't happen to
know of any one who wants her for a
wife, do you?" she asked scornfully.
Manning blushed.
"No one," he said slowly, "that is,
no one except â myself. You see, I've
been like one of the family to the
whole towi. so long that I never be
fore realized that It would be nice to
have a family of my own."

MARRIOTT
HER INSPIRATION
(Copyright. 1804. by K. M. WhltÂ«heÂ»d.)
ISS SEVIER was wor
ried.
She sat at the front
bedroom window im
patiently tapping the
arm of her wicker
rocker with one hand
and using a finger of
the other to keep place in the book that
hung the length of a listless arm on the
other side of the chair.
She was tired of teas. She had
amused herself calculating Just how
many gallons she had drunk In the ten
years of her social career. At 20 it had
seemed highly elating to put on her
newest gown and drink tea with a
crowd of people.
But at 30 she forgot to pin on the vio
lets, even when there was a huge
bunch in front of her on the dresser,
unless her maid suggested that it would
Improve madame's toilette.
She sighed in recognition of the fact
that real life doesn't work out like nov
els.
Some of her energy finally communi
cated itself to the other hand. She
threw the book on the table near and
commenced an energetic rocking that
kept pace with her thoughts.
"Money is the root of all evil, and
I've always had too much of it. I won
der which is the worse, a dencit or an
excess. T believe that as a child it wad
a pleasanter feeling to want more can
dy than to have eaten too much.
"The worst feature of this money is
that it has always attracted a crowd
of flatterers and worthless friends, and
has caused so many that I really cared
for to let their pride come between me
and them. I have known John Car
rington for five years, and would cata
logue his possessions â one estate in Vir
ginia, yielding an uncertain income;
one fine tenor voice, and enough proud
reticence to supply all the F. F. V.'s
ever heard of."
When she mentioned Carringtoo's
name the hero of the discarded novel
gracefully acknowledged the better
man, and accepted her lack or interest
In him with a humility uncommon to
a star of a second edition.
Miss Sevier's restless glance took in
the novel.
"That fool in the novel had a tenor
voice, too; but he wasn't handicapped
by a lack of self-appreciation.
"If I had asked him to sing 'For you
it is a rose, for me â It is my heart,' at
least 300 times In the last three years;
if I had played his accompaniment and
put in it all the feeling a longing heart
could possibly show when supplement
ed by my poor technique, that hero
would have understood the hint, would
have forgotten all about my money and
asked me to marry him.
"I know he loves me, but I don't be
lieve he will ever muster enough cour
age to tell me, unless I donate all my
money to a hospital, or do the propos
ing myself."
There was a taj> at the door, and
Miss Sevier's young niece came rush
ing in.
Esther always rushed, so her imme
diate family were never much startled
by het sudden entrances and exits.
"Ausitie," she tried to make her re
quest and explain her plan all at once,
"may I write and ask Tom Carter to
take me to the party to-morrow night.
the girls are all going to ask. and I
wanted to know If I might"
"What's the cause of Mr. Carter's
Â¦ridden popularity." her aunt asked.
M
feeling had srown to something strong
er than liking. For some days she
had known what he would say as
as he oÂ»uid see again, and had kncrvn
what she would say In answer
common with the rest of the
around her. she had never doubted that
all would be well with his sight. Now
came this blow.
Never to see again! To go to the
poorhouse and there drag out his
days! Never! He shall not. He shall
not!
But what could she do? Too well
Â¦he knew S.-otfs spirit to suppose that
he would accept anything from her.
that he would ever say the words shÂ»
longed to hear, the words that v.

must get that right before the bar
dages were removed. She must leal
him on to speak â but no, what
would that do? If he were to bÂ«
really blind, she knew ha would re
pudiate the bargain.
She must marry him that very day,
before the bandages were removed.
Her heart stood still at the thought.
All that was womanly in her revolted.
But then â the poorhouse! Ah! sh<*
would be so proud to work for him. to
care for him. She had no one depend
ent on her and shÂ« earned enough to
maintain them both. She must do it!
There was no other way.
Her thoughts had traveled like
lightning. In the few steps between
the doctor and the door of S
room she had thought it all out. 3t
ly she entered and went close to him.
"What was it you were saying a mo
ment ago. Mr. Scott?" she asked softly.
"Saying?" The man was puzzled for
the instant.
"About me?"
"Oh!" with Instant comprehension.
"Oh, Gertrude, do you really wa
hear it?" He groped for her hand.
caught it and drew it to him.
trude, it isn't right for me to speak
yet, but I must. I must. Oh, darling,
I love you so! I love you so! Do you
love me?"
The girl bowed her head on his
breast. "Yes. yes!" she sobbed. "m>re
than anything else in the world."
"Thank God!" The man grasped the
bandages around his head and reck
lessly tore them off. "I must see you! '
he cried. "I must see you! Oh, Ger
trude, how beautiful you are!"
But the nurse flung up her hands la
horror and strove to cover his eyes.
"Oh, oh, oh!" she walled. "Don't!
You'll ruin your last chance."
But the man clasped her wrist* and
held her from him. "I see you! I see
you!" he cried.
Neither noticed the doctor standing
at the door, but at the last words hÂ»
advanced into the room. "You see, do
you?" he asked.
"I do'"
The nurse turned with clasped hands.
"Doctor! Doctor!" she cried. "Is It a
success? Will he see?"
"Why, of course he will!" answered
that gentleman briskly. "The opera
tion has evidently been an entire suc
cess."
Troy Allison
with a decided amlunt of astonish
ment in her eyes.
"Now, auntie, you know we are not
all going to ask him, but any one we
would like to take. It's a leap year
party, you know."
"I see," returned Miss Sevier slow
ly, "and you simply want me to under
stand that one Mr. Thomas Carter ia
the â very nicest boy among your ac
quaintances, eh?"
"He's really nice, the very nicest. "
Esther answered, a red flush spread
ing to the roots of her fair hair. "May
I, auntie, please?"
"If all the other girls are of the
same opinion, perhaps you would be
wise to get your note written at once, "
teased her aunt.
The girl gave her an impulsive kiss
and then looked at her with a twinkl*
in her eye.
"I would like awfully to write it on
a sheet of your best paper," she
coaxed. i
After her 16-year-old niece had dis
appeared, having taken some of thÂ«
best paper and the sealing wa ;
match. Miss Sevier went back to the
window and stood gazing abstractedly
at the house across the street.
The house had been there for years,
but she seemed to study it with in
tense interest.
"I know he loves me," she mur
mured, and she may or may not have
referred to the grocery boy that was

cut a very creditable looking heart out
of a piece of the best paper that had

When John Carrington reached
home after a trying day in his down
town law office he found that his
landlady had put a long florist's box
on the window ledge, where It would
keep cool. He opened the box with
an expression of curiosity that the
masculine countenance often wears
when its owner is sure there is no one
to see it. There was one long-stemmed
American Beauty, and Carrington'3
sensitive face turned crimson when hÂ«Â»
saw that its stem was thrust through
a hastily cut paper heart.
That night Miss Sevier's listless

from which the heart had been cut.

A visit to Typhoon Tai, the great con
tractor, is always worth trying, though
more often than not he is away from
home on his master's business, the
great White Czar's affairs. Typhoon
Tai is a breezy, bustling Chinaman,
who wears flashy waistcoats and loves
to recall the time when as a Shantung
coolie he worked on the docks of Chefu
for 10 cents a sixteen-hour day. But
that was a long time ago, and to-day
10.000 coolies do his bidding, though
they insist on getting 15 cents a day.
Typhoon Tai has become to the Rus
sian temples of war that are rising on
the east coast of Asia what King Hiram
of Tyre was to the peace temple of
Jerusalem. He does it all or tries to.
She held up her jeweled finger and
laughed joyously. The piled up gems
that flashed under Harding's tired eyes
were no more heartless than their
beautiful owner, he thought savagely.
Selfish as he had always believed her,
he was yet stunned by her indifference.
He had been George Hives' closest
friend, and had promised him on his
deathbed six years before to keep a
watchful eye over his mother, a gra
cious, delicate woman of 50, and his sis
ter Madeline, a willful beauty of 16.
Because 6he loved diamonds, Made
line had promptly put one-half of her
patrimony on coming of age into num
erous rings to adorn her slender, tap
ering, pink-nailed fingers. The other
half was tied up so she could not
handle it, or she Would have weight
ed her toes with them too, Harding
declared in disgust when he saw her
investment. The Riveses were com
fortably fixed, but it was only by care
ful financiering and good manage
ment that mother and daughter could
live in the comparative luxury they
did. Mrs. Rives spoiled Madeline as
only a doting mother can, but then
every one, save Harding, took a hand
at spoiling Madeline. She was so very
lovely and so irresistibly sweet de
spite the selfishness Harding so great
ly deplored.
Harding was hurt. He ignored the
jeweled fingers and strode angrily to
ward her mother, who was approach
ing from the other end of the wide,
comfortable veranda. Madeline's
smile was enigmatical as she gazed at
the big, broad-shouldered figure tow
ering above her mother and openly
disdainful at his whispered command
on leaving.
"Don't tell your mother; she's un
selfish enough to care."
Mrs. Rives looked at Madeline dis
approvingly as Harding tramped an
grily down the long walk.
"Why will you persist in quarreling
with Duncan?** she rebuked gently.

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CAUL
The story of Aii Khan, who bravely
led his Turcomans to battle against
Skobeleff. and who when the battle
was lost found himself not a prisoner
but a general in ,the Russian army is
historic; but this is a bit of history
that is repeated every day in Russia's
Asiatic possessions. When I first visit
ed Vladivostok the strangest little
manikin I had ever seen came aboard
while we were yet in the outer harbor,
and made himself known as. the officer
of the Dort. He looked like an unsuc
cessful cross betwe^ an Esquimau of
Greenland and a hairy Ainu of the
Kurriies, but he wore with ostentation
that which was at once laughable and
pathetic, the gaudy uniform of the
great White Czar, who has no race
prejudices. Once or. shore we heard
his story and the reason of his employ
ment â one of the little state strokes
upon which Russian dominion in Asia
is built.
Some years before he had been cap
tured by a punitive expedition up the
Sungari River. He had tried to escape
by suicide, but in vain. When brought
into Vladivostok he was not put in
prison, but in school, and as his lan
guage was Goldi or Gilyoli. some north
ern dialect which no one knew, he had
to learn Russian. When his prelimi
nary education was completed he was
baptized in the cathedral by the Bish
op, the Governor General of Siberia
actfng as sponsor, and he of course was
given the name of a saint. Then he
had a trip to St. Petersburg, a day at
court, and now â well, now he has dis-
"I don't like paragons," said Made
line shortly. "It does him good to be

impressively. She shook her head
sadly. She had hoped things would
be different between Duncan and
Madeline. As day after day passed
FOR WHAT IS A BURDEN ANYWAY ?
v ' â Â¦
IN some form or other, we are all
burden bearers. Sometimes the
weight presses hard. And In no re
spect is there a sharper difference
between men than in the way in
which they carry their respective bur
dens. What, then, is the secret of
successful burden bearing?
In the last analysis much depends on
one's funds of courage. Most of us are
tempted to whimper over our burdens.
We say to ourselves, If not to others,
"I can't carry another ounce. I've had
sickness in my family for a long
while," or "I've been suddenly called
upon to support a distant relative," or
"I'm bearing more than my share of
responsibility in the church or in the
club and I can't stand it much longer."
Then before we know It the habit of
self-pity grows upon us and instead of
facing our burdens like heroes we draw
back from them like cowards.
A beautiful woman, one of the army
of "shut-ins." and herself wasting
away with consumption, said to me
when a boy: "God will never put any

Asiatic department.
Doubtless he has gone to visit the
people among whom he was born, to
tell them about the great Czar and
what good medicine it is to be baptized

.salary given you.
But perhaps the most interesting and
useful of Viceroy AlexiefTs native lieu
tenants is dnc who is inspired by no
particular loyalty to Russia, but who
w orships with idolatry, as though it ,
were a venerably shrine, the great bul
warks of the Char's power in, the Far
East, the fortress of Port Arthur. Â»
If I should ever attempt to fathom
the Chinese mind, a folly I cannot con
template in cold blood, I should begin
by taking a dive into the placid in
terior of Admiral Ho, the Chinese naval
officer who has held over under all the
flagsthat have flown over Port Arthur,
serving each successive master with
the same faithfulness, the same whole
souled love of his work. I mean- no dis
respect to the many distinguished of
ficers who are associated with Admiral
Alexieffâ indeed, I am merely voicing
the overwhelming popular sentiment in
the Laitong â when I say that this little
man with the lustrous, hollow eyes, the
protruding forehead, is the No. 2 man
in the ereat fortress.
I shall not try to decipher Admiral
Ho, but I cannot forego telling some
thing of his story. Some years after
the Peking campaign of 1860. when the
Anglo-Frencfi forces easily overran.
Pechili, it dawned upon several of" the
Maravene Kennedy
and Duncan did not come she was
truly angry with her willful daughter.
But the girl had never seemed so
happy; she was like a blithesome
songbird with her bubbling spirits and
gayety. And when, after a week's /Ab
sence Duncan did appear, she greeted
even him with a smile of alluring
sweetness.
"You think I'm going away," he
are put upon him to bear by a higher
power he ought to stand up to man
fashion and not be perpetually whining
about them in public or bemoaning
them in private.
It helps, too, to look upon one's
fellow men and realize that each is
carrying burdens, too. You are not
the scapegoat of the human race while
everybody else moves through life
dancing and singing like a mountain
brook. But "very few people have as
much to carry as I do." Â Doubtless
you think so, but you have probably
forgotten the fable about the eld-time
monarch, who, wearied with the
grumbling of his subjects, at last bade
them all to assemble on a certain day
at a certain place, bringing each his
own great burden. When they had
come together he commanded that all
the burdens be massed in one great
pile. Then by lot he selected one man
to help himself from the pile to the
burden which seemed to him the light
est and most agreeable. After walk
ing around the pile and looking care
fully at all the other burdens, he. se
lected the very one he had brought.
So did No. 2 and No. 3, and so on
through the list. Finally all went
silently home with their old burdens,
but with contented hearts. There Is a
deal of philosophy in this ancient tale.

Look up the definition in the diction
ary and see the primary meaning. ;It
does not necessarily carry the idea of
' strain + and friction. We speak J of\a
fruit tree with its burden of apples or
oranges. r The burden of , the tree is its
glory. That is the final purpose of its
being ; in * the world at I all. * And in â¢. the
i large view of * the matter our burdens
should be the occasion iof pride J and

They were doubtless very talented of

tached to the mission from the begin
ning a young Chinese naval mandarin
named Ho. This particular branch of
the Ho family has been very distir
guished in piratical circles for many
rations off the coast of Southern
China.
This Ho. however, had been induced
to forsake the family calling by the
prospects of an easy life and high pay
in the imperial Chinese navy. He had
been a junk master since his earliest
boyhood, but he knew nothing about
fortifications or naval architecture. He
was however, wonderfully studious
and energetic. In a few .years he had
karned all his teachers knew. and, glad
to find some one upon whom they
could shift their responsibility, the
members of the foreign mission gave
him many opportunities of doing their
work. '
When at last the mission was let go.
Ho. the young junk master, completed
the' work, was created an admiral, and
he has been in Port Arthur ever since.
Why he did not go away during the
Japanese occuration no one seems to
know. I think he remained because ha
could not tear himself away from his
life's work. 'Practically, though by in
direction, he told me as much. Soon
the Japanese began to employ him. He
seemed >;ui r e a?, interested in the for
tress and its perfection under the flag
of the Rising Sun as he had been
when the Dragon flag flew over its
battlements.
When the Russians took possession
he started, it is true, to visit his an
cestral acre in the South, but got no
further than Chefu. and then cam*
back again. Dressed as a coolie, he used
to potter around the place, now and
then offering a suggestion which often
proved helpful to the Russians. Soon
he was oskec 1 to enter the service of the
engineering department in an advisory
capacity.
The Russians recognize his ability "*â¢
and give him every opportunity to ex
ercise it for their benefit. The drydodc

work of lengthening It was Intrusted
to Admiral Ho, who brilliantly exe

Now he Is in charge of the construc

though there are naval architects and
engineers of distinguished . ability In
Port Arthur, it is generally reeognlted
that no one could have acquitted him

difficult tasks than has Ho.
' I often talked to him about the work
upon which he was engaged, but we
never touched upon the subject of poll

Tropical Housekeeping.
American housekeepers will find !t
much easier to keep their rooms clean
and bright and free from dust if they
follow the tropical plan of polishing
floors with beeswax, rubbed on with a
cocoanut husk, instead of covering
them up with carpets. It goes without
saying that it is easier to sweep a
polished floor than a carpet, and the
former is much healthier, lxieause it
does not collect the dust and dirt like
a carpet. Perhaps an absolutely bare
floor, however beautifully polished,
does not look well to eyes unaccus
tomed to it: therefore, it woUld be ad
visable for the American housekeeper
to place a small rug in front of the
couch and another in front of the fire
place to break the monotony of the
glistening surface, un the mirror-like
floor they would have a striking and
beautiful effect, far surpassing that of
even the best carpets in the market.

Is only one of many useful hints which

Lieutenant Bilse
Now Accessible to
English Readers
V IEUTENANT J. C. BIL.SE, until
m recently an officer in the German
*"' army, is now shut up in a mili
tary prison for a term of six
months, hi? connection with the forces
of the Kaiser is at an end and he is
Â¦ blacklisted upon the bonks of the Im
perial War Office. But "A Little Gar
rison," hi* novel which caused all of
the trouble, though proscribed in Ger
many, is being read by all the world
with that unholy glee which always
characterizes the enjoyment of a piece
cf scandal about a neighbor. The Fred
erick A. Stokes Company of New York
has just brought out the first English
translation, the work of Wolf yon der
Schierbrand. The publishers say that
the book is epoch-making; the world
says that it is delicious; Kaiser \N*il
hehn says that It is blasphemous.
Blt cannot be thought that the young
army lieutenant deliberately undertook
td make a martyr of himself by writing
"A Little Garrison." Nor can it be con
sidered probable that he felt any high
motive calling him to go forth like
Joan, saint to be. and rescue his coun
try from impending ruin at the hands
of a rotten army. The debonair
young lieutenant evidently saw the
need for the correction of abuses, may
be he suffered from them himself; so he
eat down to write what he knew. If the.
Kaiser, the Government party in the
Reichstag and the War Office had not
taken such violent umbrage at the book
Lieutenant Bllse would never have been
known outside of his own regiment,
and "A Little Garrison " would not have
Â¦ sold sufficiently to pay the publishers
for Its printing.
The "epoch-making" qualities of the
novel are due, then, to the absolutism
of the German system of government.
Had Kipling laid the scene of some of
his tales of Indian army life in Alsace-
Lorraine instead and given his Mrs.
Hawksby the title of Frau Post Com
mander, a roar of equal amplitude
Â¦would have come from outraged offi
cialism in military quarters. Because
Bilse's book was about the German
army and written by an officer in that
army, follow the expulsion, the Im
prisonmentâand the large sales.
Biisf lays the scene of the book in a
little frontier garrison of Alsace-Lor
raine presumably Forsbach. for there
h P himself was stationed. The plot, not
an intricate one by any means, centers
about the social doings of the officers
of the -ison and their wives. A very
unhealthy moral tone is shown to be
present. Intrigues between two of the
officers and the wives of their fellow
officers lead to a duel in one instance
and a shameful elopement in the other.
Onp of the characters is a detestable
embezzler and thief, another is brutish
ly cruel, all are drunkards. From the
Standpoint of literature alone. "The
Little- Garrison" is ultra-naturalistic.
1 As" to its political significance there
can be no doubt. Diatribes against,
Knplish and American army organiza
tion have passed and may pass without
especial comment. But the German
army, as the main support of the
sacred Kaiser, shines with a reflected
light of sanctity. With Its sanctity is
coupled the awesome reserve which
clings to holy things. That this should
have been broken and the inner se
crets of the temple spread broadcast
to the unhallowed gaze of the world is
an egregious Bin. That these secrets,
moreover, are none too rpotless adds
to the weight of the crime.
Speaking generally the skeletons In
the army closet which Lieutenant Bllse
discloses to view cannot be said to be
so much the property of the German
army system itself as of the officers
â¢who are enrolled In the army corps. ;
Bllse does not Inveigh strongly against
theoretical lack of efficiencyâ absence
of patriotism, tendency to demoraliza
tion and sueh â but It Is the moral rot
tenness of the army officers, their ,-^r..
bUng, their incontinence, their gross
cruelty to subordinates, which he con
demns. He shows that the present
army life breeds spendthrifts, fosters
onerous bondage to usurers and en
courages merrlafe for fat dowries.

Henry Harland's
Literary Pastel
Painted in Italy
jm PASTEL in literature. That Is
perhaps the happiest character
ization of Henry Harland's "My
Friend Prospero." A pastel, lightly
sketched, delicately colored and spright
ly In its conception; a wholly artistic
thing, created in the spirit of art only
and with no purpose other than that
of pleasing. Harland's book may be
likened to those fascinating drawings
of Maxfleld Parrisn, wherein castellated
walls, mythical gardens and shadowy
palaces are made to stand out from the
limbo of romance with all the clearness
and boldness of line of an architectural
blue-print.
The secret of "The Cardinal's Snuff
box" is also that of "My Friend Pros
pero." In the former story, as in this
last creation of his, Harland has
thrown all the charm of mediaeval ro
mance about a tale in modern setting,
with the result that we find in the fin
ished product something which might
be styled a conventionalized trouba
dour's chanson. The romantic past is
so artfully blended with an idyllic pres
ent; there is such a rare dash of Im
probability, seeming ever probable. The
sunshine of the story appears to be re
flected back from the monastery of
Abelard or the bower of La Belle Dame
Sans Merci. The people In the tale are
those of any modern old world draw
ing-room.
Mr. Harland opens his narrative with
the accidental meeting between the
good old dowager. Lady Blanchemain
of Belmore Gardens. Kensington, and
her nephew of distant kin, John
Blanchemain. They meet in an an
cient palace of the Sforzas, situated
away up In a picturesque corner of
Lombardy. John, It seems, is a happy
go-lucky young Englishman, lazy,
poor, but brimming over with Ideals,
who is stopping with the resident chap
lain of the palace in order that he may
live next to lovely nature and forget
the humdrum world. Hardly has the
relationship of the two been disclosed
when the heroine of the story, Princess
Maria Dolores of Zelt-Neuminster, is
discovered, bending over a moss-grown
sun dial In the garden. Before long
John has occasion to learn that her
name is Maria Dolores â the rest of the
patronymic is not to be found out, and
thereupon hinges the plot.
Through 'little Annunzi&ta, the
eleven-year-old niece of the castle
chaplain, the somewhat inconsequen
tial John Blanchemain contrives to
meet Maria Dolores ,and straightway
falls desperately In love with her. The
tiny little Annunziata, a quaint little
chit, is the unconscious god from the
machine who continuously brings the
two together. Follows the quick
tierce and riposte of wit, for Harland
could not unite two hearts save after
the fierce refining which comes of the
struggle of whetted minds. John Is cer
tain that his goddess' name must be
ROBERT W.
RITCHIE
Schmidt and that her father Is one of
the bourgeoisie; equally assured is she
that the young Englishman can be
nothing but a Brown or a Jones, as are
most Englishmen. By dwelling upon
the details of a hypothetical love John
allows Maria Dolores to divine his
sentiments toward her, but he nearly
spoils all by stoutly declaring that his
poverty is an insurmountable bar to
all thought of wedded bliss.
Just when all seems lost the Lady
Blanchemain fills the breach by settling
a generous provision of her wealth
upon penniless John, and the two lovers
are brought together over the sick-bed
of little Annunziata.
A bald outline of the plot cannot be
gin to do justice to the subtle charm of
"My Friend Prospero." For the worth
of Mr. Harland's story lies not only in
the plot conception, but fn the careful
building up of the piece. His power Is
essentially that of wit. With repartee
and glinting dialogue, by the ready ex
change of sharp thrust and skillful
parry and the expressions of quaint
philosophical mots the story trips along
to the end without ever a cessation
from its cleverness. This sparkling
quality of Its word play and the salt of
its clever conceits produces an effect as
exhilarating as a play of Congreve's.
With the exception of Annunziata
there is no attempt to outline the char
acters of the personages in "My Friend
Proepero." Upon this odd little Italian
girl, part mystic, part religionist, the
author has done good work. By her
love of the flowers, the river, the wood
ed hills, she proves herself to be as
true a child of nature as any nymphs
of Artemis. Indeed, her confusion of
the old classic myths with some of the
equally mythological conceptions of her
church makes her seem a veritable lit
tle sprite of the woods herself. Such a
6weet little child as Annunziata gives
peculiar charm to the tale.
The romantic coloring of the story Is
imparted throughout by suggestion
rather than studied statements on the
part of the author. The remoteness of
the old castle and its seclusion amidst
the wooded hills seems to shut the rest
of the world out of the story. The
shaded walks, the cloisters of the chap
el, the long gallery of old portraits, all
serve to throw over the tale a thin gos
samer of the past which tinges the
whole with the softened light of ro
mance.

Turkish Customs
Are Revealed by
a Clever Writer
TO the series of Our European
Neighbors books, which Put
namÃ have been publishing,
Lucy M. Garnett has added "Turkish
Life in Town and Country." Of Its
kind tho work Is as high class as any
thing published within recent years.
Miss Garnett's task has been no light
one, for it Is doubtful whether there Is
another country In tho world where
there is a population so mixed as in
the domains of the Sultan. Few coun
tries likewise are sealed to foreigners
seeking information so effectually. The
typical Turkish reticence, added to the
equally characteristic Turkish duplic
ity, makes a true statement of facts
concerning life and customs within the
borders of the Grand Turk difficult to
obtain and cbrrespondlngly valuable
when it has been acquired. It must be
believed that the author's extended
residence In the Ottoman empire and
her influence In high places has given
her the power to speak authoritatively.
The greater part of Miss Garnett's
book is devoted to a study of the Os
manll or true Turks, the descendants
of the invading Ottomans of the Mid
dle Ages. Their homes, their social
customs and the place which is theirs
THE r SAN w FRANCISCO v SUNDAY' CALL.
as rulers of the heterogenous popula
tion are by the author described faith
fully. r She finds the Turks a hospit

relatives and' living very closely to > the
. pure- teachings of the Koran. , Of the
.mooted-question . 'â of â the '; harem : and
; harem life the author has this to say: |
"From the foregoing description of
the homes of Osmanlis of all, classes
It should, \ I think, be apparent that
; the harem, far from being, as is often
supposed, 'a detestable . prison.' Is the
most cheerful and commodious divi
. sion of an Osmanll's house. â¢ â¢ - *
Daily life in a Turkish harem is no
doubt, as a rule, somewhat monoto
nous and In some ways the liberty of
a Turkish lady is certainly more ; re
stricted than that of European women
generally;* but in her own. home she
is absolutely mistress of her time as
of her property." .â¢
'Â¦','.' The author discredits stories of
I murders by . midnight and ' the immo
. lation of the fair ones of the harem.
â¢ The popular conception of the
crafty Turk who will wring the last '.Â¦
shekel out of a customer : evidently
does not apply to the Osmanll, for
"the Turks, generally | speaking, are
â¢ not active 4 and intelligent as business Â¦
men," says Miss Garnett, "and they
venture little into speculative com- V
mercial transactions. â¢ â¢ â¢* The

Metric Fallacy
Demands Writers'
Severe Criticism
(Â£ 4-^Â»HE Metric Fallacy," by Fred
i erlck A. Halaey, and "The
Metric Failure in the Textile
Industry," by Samuel S. Dale, are in
corporated into a volume bearing the
caption of the former brochure, and
designed, as the title shows, to com
bat the further acceptance of the
metric system of weights and
measures. The book is the outgrowth
of a paper presented to the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers at Its
annual meeting in 1902 and, therefore,
can be received by those interested in
the subject with this stamp of genu
ine merit upon It.
The authors evidently take their
subject with due seriousness. Every
possible table of statistics and all ob
tainable records are adduced to dem
onstrate the fact that the system as
sailed has wholly or in part, at least,
failed to fulfill the requirements of an
adequate institution in FÂ»ance, and
that Its adoption by English-speaking
countries would be attended by whole
sale disorder and mercantile confusion.
Mr. Halsey condemns the metric sys
tem upon the following counts:
"1. That as shown by the experience
of other* countries, the changing of a
people's system of weights and meas
ures is a task of enormous difficulty,
and is attended with widespread con
fusion.
"2. That the adoption of the metric
system 1 , meaning* by that term the re
tirement of the inch and the substitu
tion therefor of the millimeter, involves
the destruction of all mechanical stand
ards.
"3. That the prosperity of foreign
trade in nowise requires the adoption
of the system as a basis of manu
facture.
"4. That the bill now before Congress
is a compulsory measure, so far as it
relates to those who do business with
any ot the departments of the Govern
ment.
"6. That the metric system has for
Industrial purposes no such superiority
as is claimed, and that the claims for
the saving of time in calculations and
in the school life of children are com
pletely negatived by the certainty that,
here as elsewhere, the old units will
â¢persist in use and must be learned.
"6. That the confusion which is said
to prevail in our weights and measures
Is a fiction.
"7. That, measured by the number of
units In common use, and by their uni
form value in all sections and all In
dustries, we have the simplest and the
most uniform system of weights and
measures of any country in the world."

New School Books
of High Standard
Being Published
yjr*lTH the opening of the new
â¢ M i j school year there has come
T^ 1^ from the American * Book
Company, : the standard publishers
of text books, a new output ;of
books for use in schools and colleges.
ÂBy their consistent policy of putting
forth only that which is the product of
the best minds in the educational
world;., the .American Book Company
has succeeded in bringing to the eyes
of American pedagogues text books
which are remarkably well adapted to
modern f ; methods of teaching. Their
: winter's publishing Is sufficiently note
worthy to demand extended considera
tion. i :'\\ Â¦
Perhaps the most valuable of the new
publications is ; the "Outlines of Greek
c History,", by ...William C. Morey of the
University of Rochester. The present
volume is designed to form, with the
Â« same author's "Outlines of Roman His
: tory," ; a complete elementary course In
ancient history. The first part of the
book comprises a brief sketch of : the
ancient Oriental peoples. . Then the his
tory of Greece is taken up. The author
has kept in mind the fundamental idea
that the historical significance of a peo
ple ;Is to be estimated by what :it has
contributed to ,the ; advance of civiliza
tion. His treatment, therefore, gives
special attention to the development of
Greek culture and of political Institu
tions. ,: The : topical method ; is employed,"
: and each chapter ( is supplemented jby
- selections for reading and a subject for
special study. The ;r:; r : book ~\\ points out
clearly the most 1 essential â¢ and \signifi
cant facts In Greek history, and shows
the Important Influence which Greece,
In art, In ' literature, and in philosophy,
- exercised upon , the subsequent .; history
! of the world. , ) The work Is sufficient ! to
meet the : requirements for entrance of
the leading colleges, 1 and also the course
; prescribed :by the New York State re-
' gents. -Â¦ r , --Â¦-Â¦â¢ Â¦Â¦\\ .-;_â¢Â¦ â¢Â¦/ Â¦ - .;Â¦ â¢_-,V;~"
*- - For beginners ; in ; the '. history iof i old
Greece as well as for general use in
the primary classroom there Is Fred
erick A. Hall's "Homeric Stories." The
pure and highly imaginative tales of
Homer are in this book adapted for
elementary reading and presented as a
connected narrative. They will prove
both entertaining and profitable read
ing for the children and a fruitful
source of material for teachers. They
will explain the numerous references
and allusions to the characters and In.
cidents of the Iliad and the Odyssey so
often found both in classical and in cur
rent literature. The style of the narra
tive is clear and simple and will both
arouse the pupil's interest and hold his
attention. The book is profusely illus
trated, largely from the works of cele
brated painters and sculptors. It Is the
most recent addition to the well-known
series of Eclectic School Readings, and
is especially Intended for use in the
sixth and seventh grades.
To meet the entrance requirements in
English literature demanded by the
larger colleges, Henry Van Dyke of
Princeton University, the general edi
tor of the Gateway Series cf English
classics, has brought out Macaulay'a
"Essay on Milton." edited by E. S.
Oullck; Carlyle's "Essay on Burns,"
with notes by Edward Mims, and
"Merchant of Venice, revised and an
notated by Felix Schelling. The editing
of these volumes is carefully and Judi
ciously done, the books being treated
as pieces of literature, rather than as
frameworks for erudite theories of
criticism. The actual needs and capac
ities of the young people who are to
read and study them have been borne
in mind. The series should be wel
comed by all teachers of English liter
ature, for it incorporates the best that
acknowledged experts can do to make
the texts easier to understand, more
attractive and more profitable to the
young reader.
It is doubtful if "Poets of the
South," by F. V. N. Painter, will find
very general acceptance, for, with the
exception of Poe, Southern bards have
not been credited with very general
recognition. A preliminary chapter
treats of the minor poets of the South,
followed by chapters devoted to the
lives and works of Poe, Hayne, Timrod,
Lanier and Father Ryan. A portrait
of each of these authors is given, to
gether with typical selections from
their works. References are included
In a body of explanatory notes which
make plain all allusions.
Study of the modern languages has
received especial attention from the
publishers. In the French there are
two elementary works for beginners by
Victor E. Francois and L. C. Syms. For
advanced readers there are Sandeau's
"Mile, de la Seigllere." edited by Eliz
abeth M. White; Moliere's inimitable
"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme," with
notes by P. A. Rol and W. G. Gultteau;
and Dumas' "Les Trois Mousquetalres,"
annotated by C. Fontaine.
Professor J. Henry Senger of the Uni
versity of California has edited Foque's
"Undine," one of the most popular and
touching of fairy tales in German, with
its pathetic presentation of a woman
to whom love has given a soul, and who
deems henself happy In its possession,
despite all the suffering that the divine
gift entails. The story Is simple, clear
and effective, and has been translated
Into most of the European languages.
Scheffel's "Der Trompeter yon Sakkin
gen," one of the strongest stories In
modern German literature, has been
published, with notes by Valentine
Buehner.
The last addition to the American
Book Company's series of modern
Spanish readings is Larra's "Partlr a
Tiempo," edited by E. B. Nichols. The
story Is characterized by graceful hu
mor, keen observation and rare quali
ties of style. It affords ample oppor
tunity for the sutry of colloquial Span
ish and for the acquisition of a wide
vocabulary and though slight In Itself
it Is especially suited for class reading.
Paragraphs From
the Gossip About
Popular Writers
TiyfTRS. MARY AUSTIN, the Cali
lFM fornian whose book. "The Land
â¢^ of Little Rain," met with such
a hearty reception all through the East
last fall, 1 believes that the. novel which
will be her host is that which she hopes
to write about San Francisco life In
the near future. During a recent
short visit to this . ity Mrs. Austin Â»x
pressed to thf* edttof of these columns
her views upon tho literary possibilities
which lie open to the writer here in
San Francisco.
"There is no city in the United
States," said she, "wherein one can
find such a wealth of local color and
such a fund of tradition as right here
in this cosmopolitan city by the Golden
Gate. We have types of every people
under the sun. we have the remnants
of the past days of gold, we have a life
which is distinct in itself. I hope to
do my best work right here."
Mrs. Austin's home is at Inde
pendence. Inyo County â upon the very
edge of the desert of which ahe writes
so charmingly.
'"The Lounger," who furnishes the
delightful column of literary chit-chat
for The Critic, has cleared a mystery
of a norn de plume. Hs says: "Less
than a year ago the readers of pop
ular magazines began to be Btartled
and delighted by certain fantastic and
ingenious tales, mainly dealing with
Western life and bearing the strange
device XX Henry' as a signature. In a
shore time people began to talk to
each other about the stories, and very
soon they began to ask who the author
was. It was then that a new problem
fell upon this over-puzzled age â who
is "O. Henry?' No one seemed to know
the author's real name, and immedi
ately vague and weird rumors began
to be afloat and the norn de plume
was soon Invested with as much curi
osity as surrounds an author after his
decease. But, like most mysteries,
when it wa3 probed there was no mys
tery about it. O. Henry's" real name is
Sydney Porter, a gentleman from
Texas, who, having seen a great deal
of the world with the naked eye, hap
pened to find himself ia New York
about two years ago, and there dis
covered a market where people would
buy stories of his experiences.
The editor of the New York Times'
Saturday review of books comments
editorially upon the recent sale of Mil
ton MSS. in London. Says -he: "Some
body has been learning something In
London about the danger of overrating
literary rarities, simply aa such. He
had what we may assume to have been
authentically proved to have been part
of the original printer's copy of "Par
adise Lost," and he thought it wax
worth a good deal of money. Doubt
less it was worth money. As to 'a
good deal,' that depends on what you
call a good deal. His arbitrary notloa
was that $23,000 was about the at
tainable maximum and Â£â¢ fixed his
price accordingly. But he fell short
of realizing it by $1250. the highest
bid being $23,750, and that bid. there
is reason to susDect, being collusive. '
H. B. Marriott-Watson, literary
crltlo for the London Mail, has some
thing to say about Thomas Hardy's
"The Dynasts." He thinks that the
only dramatic comparison with Uar
dy's play. "The Dynasts," with Its
nineteen acts, must be sought In "Ce
lestial" literature. "I do not mean the
literature of the spirits and phantoms,
of which the author writes," siys the
critic, "but of thÂ» Chinese.- A Chi
nese play will ramble on for a week,
and clearly Hardy's oanoiam*. might
be taken In that way. Ht.*d/i devo
tion to poetry in his later year* >Â»
touching. Like Meredith, he began
his career by writing verse, but he
confesses that he destroyed those early
efforts. No doubt the reception given
to 'Jude the Obscure,' a remarkable
novel, discouraged him greatly, and
that Is possibly the reason he turned
his back on fiction and Is wooing his
first love."
Henry C. Rowland, the author of
"Sea Scamps," has consorted with a
great many people of varied moral
stripes during a life of ad
venture that has carried him
all over the Gulf ot Mexico and
the Philippines. But few people would
dare to go, as he did, on a bunting trip
Into the swamps of Florida, with a bad
man and acknowledged murderer. In
1894, he wanted a guide to take him
hunting on the west coast of Florida.
He found one and after being out with
him for some days awoke to the fact
that he was alone in the wilds with
the prize criminal of ths country. Most
men would probably have made tracks
Immediately for home, but Rowland
continued his hunting for ssveral
months and declared that Mr. Mur
derer-Thief-and-Burglar was quite an
agreeable companion when you could
get It out of your mind that he might
kill you In your sleep.

and insecurities of all kinds. The brok

change doorkeeper, all Wall street
read the morning papers, not to ascer
tain the news, but to pick such items
a.~ would, should or might have some
effect on stock values. There was no
trod but the ticker and the brokers
were its prophets!
As lime wore on the glamour of the
BUM wore off; likewise his scruples.
His employers and their customers all
lemaaly. agreeable people â
lated every day. and nobody found
fault with them. It was not a sin; it
was a regular business. And so when
ever there was a "good thing" he
"chipped in" SI to a telephone boys'
"pool." that later operated in a New
street bucket shop to the extent of ten
shares. His means were small, his sal
ary being only $S a week, and very
often he thought that if he only had a
little more money he would speculate
en a larger scale and profit proportion
ately. â¢
Now, the position of telephone boy Is
really important, in that it requires not
only a quick-witted but a trustworthy
person to fill it. In the first place, the
boy knows whether his firm is buying
or selling: certain stocks; he must ex
ercise discrimination in the matter of
awarding the orders should the board
member of the firm happen to be un
available when the boy receives the or
der. For example: International Pipe
may be" selling at 10S. .A man in Tracy
* Middleton's office who has bought 500
shares of it at 104 wishes to "corral" his
profits. He gives an order to the firm
to sell the stock, let us say. "at the
market"â that is, at the ruling market
price. Tracy & Middleton immediately
telephone over their private line to the
Stock Exchange to their board member
to "sell 500 shares of International Pipe
at the market." The telephone boy re
ceives the message and "puts up" Mr.
Middletor.'s number, which means that
on the multi-colored, checkered strip
on the frieze of the New street wall
Mr. Middleton's number, 611, appears
by means: of an electrical device. The
moment Mr. Middleton sees that his
number is "up" he hastens to the tele
phone booth to see what is wanted.
Now. if Mr. ' Middleton delays In an
rwerlng his number the telephone boy
knows he is absent and gives the order
to one of the "two-dollar" brokers, who
always hover about the booths looking
for orders. He does . the same if he
knows that Mr. Middleton Is very busy
executing some other order, or if in his
judgment the order calls for immediate
execution.
Toung Hay-ward attended to his busi
ness closely, and when Mr. Middleton
was absent from the floor or busy he
impartially distributed the firm's tele
phoned buying or selling orders among
the two-dollar brokers, for Tracy, &
Middleton did a very good commission
business indeed. He was a nice look
ing and nice acting little chap was
Haywardâ clean faced, polite and ami
able. The brokers liked him and they
"remembered" him at Christmas. The
best memory was possessed â¢ by "Joe"
Jacobs, who gave him . $:5 and insin
uated that he would -like to do more
of Tracy & Middleton's business than
he had been getting.
"But," said Sally, "the firm said I
was to give the order to whichever
broker I found first."
-"Well." said Jacobs, oleaginously, "I
am never too busy to take orders from
such a nice young fellow as yourself
if you lake the trouble to find me; and
I'll do something nice for you. Look
here," in a whisper, "if you give me
plenty of business I'll ' give you 55 . a
week." And he dived into the mob that
was yelling itself i hoarse about the
Gotham Gas post. .'. ' . ". .
Hay ward's first impulse was to tell
his firm about it, because he felt vague
ly that Jacobs would not have offered
him $5 a week if. he. had not expected
something dishonorable in return. Be
fore the market closed.- however, he
spoke to Willie' Simpson. McDuff &
Wilkinson's boy. whose telephone was
next to Tracy & Middleton's. Sure
enough Willie expressed great indigna
tion at Jacob's action.
"It's just like that old skunk." said
Willie. "Five dollars a week, when he
can make $100 out of the firm. Don't
you do it. Sally. Why. Jim Burr, who
had the place before you, used to get
$20 a week from old man Grant and
$50 a month from Wolff. You've got
a cinch if you only know how to work
it. Why. they are supposed to give
you 50 cents a hundred."
Willie had been in the business for
two years, and he was a very well
dressed youth, indeed. Sally now un
derstood how he managed it on a sal
ary of $12 a week.
He did not say anything to the firm
that day. nor any other day. . And he
didn't say anything to Jacobs in re
turn, but by Willies sage advice con

FOP THE LAST TIME
tented himself with merely withhold
ing all orders from that oleaginous
personage u'tittt Mr. Jacobs was moved
to remonstrate. And Sally, who had
learned a great deal in a week under
Willies tuition. answered curtly:
"Business is very bad; the firm is do
ing hardly anything."
"But Watson told me," said Jacobs,
angrily, "that he was doing a great
deal of business for Tracy & Middle
ton. I want you to see that I get my
Fhare or 111 speak to Middleton and
find out what the trouble is."
"Is that so?" said Sally calmly.
'You might also tell Mr. Middleton
that you offered me $5 a week to give
you the bulk of our business."
Jacobs came down to business at
once. "I'll make it $8," he said con
cilia tingly.
"Jim Burr, who had the position
before me, " expostulated Sally indig
nantly, "told me he received $25 a
â¢week from Mr. Grant, with an extra
$10 thrown in from time to time,
when Mr. Grant made some luiky
turn, to say nothing of what the other
men did for him."
â¢"You must be crazy," said Jacobs
angrily. 'Why, I never get much
more than a thousand shares a week
from Tracy & Middleton, and usually
less. Say, you ought to be on the
floor. You are wasting your talent in
the telephone business, you are. Lets
swap places, you and I."
"According to our books." said Sal
ly to the irate broker, having been
duly coached by William Simpson,
"the last week you did business for us
you did 3000 shares and received $76."
"That was ;in exceptional week. I'll
make it $10." said Jacobs.
"Twenty-five," whispered Sally de
terminedly.
"I'll give you $15 a week, but you
must see that 1 get at least 2590 shares
a week."
"Al) right. I'll do the best 1 can for
'you, Mr. Jacobs."
And he did. for the other brokers
gave him only 2u cents, or. at the most
50 cents per hundred shaies. In the
course of a month or two Sally was in
possession of an income of Mo a week.
And he was only 18.
Time passed. As it had happened
with his predecessor, so did it happen
now with Sally. He began by specu
lating, wildly at first, more carefully
later on. From the bucket shops he
went to the Consolidated Exchange.
Then he asked Jacobs and the other
two-dollar brokers to let him deal in
a small way with them, which they did
out of personal liking for him, until he
had three senarate.accounts and could
"swing a line" of several hundred
shares.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
At last the \\oxv fell which Sally had
so long dreaded â he was "promoted"
to a clerkship in Tracy & Middleton's
office. The^firm meant to reward him
for his devotion to his work, for his
brightness and quickness. From $15 a
week they raised his salary to $25,
which they considered quite generous,
especially in view of his youth and that
he had started three years before with
$8. He was only 20 now. But Sally,
knowing it meant the abandonment of
â¢his lucrative perquisites as telephone
"boy," bemoaned his undeserved fate.
He took the money he had made to
Mr. Tracy and told him an interesting
story of a rich aunt and a legacy, and '
asked him to let him open an account
in the office. Tracy congratulated his
young clerk, took the $6500, and there
after Sally was both an employe and a
customer of J"r,acy &. Middleton.
Sally speculated with varying suc
cess, running up his winnings to $10,
00 and seeing them dwindle later to
$6000. But, In addition to becomine an
inveterate speculator, he gained much
valuable experience. He became friend
ly and even familiar with Tracy &
Middleton's clients, among whom were
some very wealthy men, for a stock
broker's office is a democratic place.
He really was a bright, amiable fel
low, very obligingâ he was paid for it
by the firmâ and he made the most of
his opportunities. The customers grew
to like him exceedingly well and to
think v.-ith respect of his judgment,
market-wise. One day W. Basil
Thornton, one of the wealthiest and'
boldest customers of the firm, com
plained of the difficulty of "beating
the game" with the heavy handicap
of the large brokerage commission.
Jestingly, yet hoping 'to be taken
seriously, Sally said: "Join the New
York Stock Exchange, or buy me a
seat, and start the firm of Thornton &
Hayward. Just think, . cojonel. we
would have your trade, and you could
bring some friends, and I could bring
mine, and I think many of these"â
pointing to Tracy & Middleton's cus
tomers â "would come ovef to us. They
all think a lot," diplomatically, "of
your opinions on the market."*
Thornton was favorably impressed
with the idea, and Sally saw it., From
that moment on he worked hard
to gain the colonel's confidence.
It was he who gave Thornton
the first hint of Tracy ft Mid
dleton's condition, which led to
the withdrawal of Thornton's account
and his own from the office. It was a
violation of confidence and of business
ethics, but Thornton was very grateful
when, two months later, Tracy & Mid
dleton farted 'under circumstances
which were far from creditable and
which were discussed at great length
by the street. He showed" his grati
tude by adding a round sum to Sally's
$11,500, and Willis N. Hayward became
a member of the New York Stock Ex
change. Shortly afterward the firm of
Thornton & Hayward. bankers and
brokers, was formed. SaHy. then in his
twenty-fifth year, had become a sea
soned Wall street man.
From the start the new firm did well.
Colonel Thornton ancj two or three
friends who followed him from Tracy
& Middleton's offlfte. all of them "plung
ers," were almost enough to keep Hay
ward busy on the exchange executing
orders, and, moreover, new customers
were ooming In.
Thornton was a rich man, and pro
tected his own speculations more than
amply. He noticed the development of
his young 'partner's gambling procliv
ities and remonstrated with him In a
kindly, paternal sort of way.
Sally vowed he would stop.
Within less than three months he
t
EDWN LEFEVRE
had broken his promise twice, and his
unsuccessful operations in Alabama
Coal at one time threatened seriously
to embarrass the firm.
Colonel Thornton came to the rescue.
Sally promised with a Botemnity born
of sincere fear never to do It again. ,-
But fright lasts only a little space;
and memory is equally ehort lived.
Wall street has no room for men with
an excess of timidity or of recollection.
He had gambled before he joined â¢ thÂ»
New York* Stock Exchange.
And then, too, Willis N. Hayward.
the board member of Thornton & Haj^
ward, was a very different person from
Sally, the nice little telephone boy of
Tracy * Middleton's. His cheeks were
not pink; they were mottled. His eyes
were not clear and ingenuous; they
were shifty and a bit watery. He had
been In Wall street eight or ten yeans,
and he overworked his nerves every day
from 10 a. m. to 3 p. m. on the Stock
Exchange; also from 5 p. m. to mid
night at the cafe of a big uptown hotel,
where Wall street men gathered to talk
shop. His system craved stimulants;
gambling and liquor were the strongest
he knew.
When, after two years, the firm ex
pired by limitation Colonel Thornton
withdrew. He had had enough of Hay
ward'* plunging. To be sure Sally had
become a shrewd "trader." and he had
made $75,000 during the big bull boom;
but he was at heart a "trader," which
Is to say a mere gambler in stocks, and
not a desirable commission man.
But Sally, .flushed with success on
the bull side, did not worry when
Thornton refused to continue the part
nership. The slogan was: "Buy A. O.
T. It's sure to go up!" the initials
standing for "Any Old Thing!" The
most prosperous period in the indus
trial and commercial history of the
United States begot an epidemic of
speculative madness such as was never
before known and probably never
again will be. Everybody had money
iv abundance and the desire for specu
lation in superabundance. Sally
formed a new firm immediately â
Hayward & Co. â with his cashier as
partner.
All mundane things have an end,
even bull markets and bear markets.
The bull markets saw Hayward & Co.
doing a Rood business, as did every
body else in Wall street. It ended and
the firm's customers, after a few bad
â¢'slumps" in prices, were admonished
to turn bears in order to recoup their
losses. Bears believe prices axe too
high and should go lower; balls, op
timists, believe the opposite. The
public can't sell stocks "short" any
more than the average man is left
handed. These customers were no ex
ception, so they did nothing,
Hayward had "overstayed" Jhe bull
market, -though not disastrously; that
Is, 'he was in error regarding the ex
tent and duration of the upward move
ment of prices. He proceeded to fall
into a similar error on the bear or
downVrard side.-The market had been
extremely dull- following what the
financial writers called a "severe de
cline," but which meant the loss of
millions of dollars by speculators.
Hayward's customers, like everybody
else's customers, were not speculating.
So he used their money to protect his
own speculations. Office expenses
â¢u-ere numerous and heavy and com
missions few and light.
Hayward was very bearish. He had
sold stocks, sharing the belief of the
majority of his fellows that the lowest
prices had not been reached. As a
result he was heavily "short" and he
could not "cover" at a profit, because
prices had advanced very slowly, but
very steadily.
One day a big gambler In Chicago,
bolder or keener than his Eastern
brethren, thought the time was ripe
for a "bull" or upward movement in
general, and particularly in Consoli
dated Steel Rod Company's stock. He
was the chairman of the board of di
rectors. William G. Dorr decided upon
a. plan whereby the stock could be
made attractive to that class of spec
ulative investors, so to speak, who
liked to buy stocks making strenuous
disbursements of profits to their hold
ers. Mr. Dorr's plan was kept a se
cret. The first step consisted of send
ing in large buying orders, handled
by prominent brokers, and synchron
ously the publication in the daily
press of various items, all reciting the
wonderful prosperity of the Consoli
dated Steel Rod Company and its phe
nomenal earnings: also the unutter
able cheapness of the stock at the pre
vailing price. Mr. Dorr and asso
ciates, of course, had previously tak
en advantage of the big "slump" or
fall in values to buy back at 33 the
same stock they had sold to the pub
lic some weeks before, at 70. Having
Required this cheap stock, they "man
ipulated" â by means of further pur
c hose â the price so that they could
sell out at a profit.
It so happened, however, that once
before dividend rumors about "Con.
â¢ Steel Rod" had been disseminated,
with the connivance of Dorr, and they
had not come true, to the great detri-
I ment of credulous buyers and greater
profit of the insiders, who were
"short" of the stock "up to their
n^cks" â a typical. "bit of stock jobbing
â¢whereat other and more artistic stock
jobbers hnd expressed the greatest
indignation. Instead of putting the
stock on a dividend paying basis the
directors decided â at the last hour â
that it would not be conservative to
do so. whereupon the stock had "bro
ken" seventeen points. The lambs lost
hundreds of thousands of dollars; the
Insiders gained as much. It was a
"nice turn."
Hayward remembered this, and when
the stock after several days of conspic
uous activity and steady advances rose
to 52, he promptly sold "short" 5000
shares â believing that the barefaced
Â¦ manipulation would not raise the stock
much above that'fi^ure and that before
long it must decline." Only a month
previously it had sold at 36 and nobody
wanted any of It. He was all the more
decided in his opinion that the "top"
had been reached by prices because Mr.
Dorr in a Chicago paper had stated
that the stockholders would probably
receive an entire year's dividends at
one fell swoop "by reason of the unex
ampled prosperity in the steel rod
trade. Such an action was unprecedent
ed. â¢ It had been talked about at various
times in connection with other stocks,
but it had never come true. Why
should it come true in this instance?
Hayward, familiar with Dorr's record,
promptly "coppered" his tip to buy,
banking on Dorr's consistent mendac
ity. But Mr. William G. Dorr, shrewd
est and boldest of all Western stock
gamblers, fooled everybodyâ he actual
iof the street When he tells the truth
Â£SS sA Â£M
street could recover from the shocK tne
irice o : the stock was up five points
.Sbteh meant that Hayward was -out
$25,000 on that deal alone. But In .addi
tion the general list was carried up
ward sympathetically.. Money rates
and bear hopes fell;"s*ck values and
bull courage rose. Â¦Â¦*- Hay ward began
Â¦ "covering" Steel Rod. He ' bought in
5000 shares, and after he had finished
he lost 526.750 by the deal. He was still
"short" about 12.000 shares of other
stocks on which his "paper' losses at
tne last quoted prices were over 80.000,
but if he tried to buy back such a large
amount of stock In a market so sensi
tive to any kind of bull impetus he
would send prices upward in a jiffy. in
creasing his own losses very materi
ally.
â¢ He went to his office that morning in
a -tremor. He consulted the cashier,
and found he had only $52,000 at the
bank, of which, two-thirds belonged to
r his customers. He was already, moral
ly speaking, an embezzler. He was
ruined if he didn't cover, and he was
ruined if he did. His "seat" on the
Stock Exchange was worth possibly
$4Â»,000, not a cent more; and as he per
sonally owed his out-of-town corre
spondents nearly $38,000 ha could not
avoid being hopelessly ruined. More
over, his bankruptcy would not be an
"honest" failure, for. as he told him
self bitterly, after the harm was don*.
"I had no business to speculate on my
.own hook with other people's money."
Now he was face to face with the
question that every gambler dreads:
"If I stood to lose all. how desperate a
risk would I take in order to get It
back?" >
As he left his office to go to the
"board room" he put to himself the
fateful query. But he would not let
himself answer it until he. had stopped
at "Fred's." the official barroom of the
Stock Exchange, and had taken a stilt
drink of raw whisky. Then the answer
came. : -
He was ruined anyhow. If he failed
without further ado. that is. without
. increasing his liabilities, he would be
i cursed by twenty- five of his customers
and by fifteen of his fellow brokers
who were "lending" stocks to him. But
If* he made one last desperate effort
he misrht pull out of the hole; or, at
.the worst, why, the number of, cursing
customers would remain the same, but
Â¦ the fellow brokers would rise to twenty
or thirty. Â¦-;..â-*.:
r. He took another stiff drink. The mar-
j ket had become undoubtedly a bull
; market. The bears had been fighting
the advance, and there still remained
a stubborn short interest in certain
stocks, as, for example, in American
Sugar , Company stock. Now if that
short interest could be stampeded It
. mijjht mean an eight or ten point ad
liyaSec. If be " bought 10,000 or 13.000
â¢shares and sc-ld them at an average
profit of four or five points, he would
put off the disaster, and if he made ten
points he would be a great operator.
He had. to be sure, no business to buy
even 1000 shares of sugar; but then f
he hail no business to be on the verge
of \bitnkruptcy. ; ' ,
The liauor was potent. Sally said to
himself aggrievedly: "I might as well
be hung: for. a flock as for one measly
k old . mutton." . 'Â¦*, :' *J-
He walked a trifle unsteadily from
"Fred's" across the narrow asphalted
New street to the . Stock* Exchange.
He paused at the entrance. There was
.no escape. Unless he could make a
lucky, strike he would fall ignomlnl
ously.
- "Pike's Peak or bust!" he muttered
to himself, and walked Into the biff
room.
"Good morning. Mr. Hayward." said
Â¦>â¢Â¦ the doorkeeper. Hayward nodded ab
sently, caught himself repeating.
"Pike's Peak or bust!" and walked
straight toward the sugar, post.
V He began to bid for stock. One thou
1 sand share* at 116; he got It. Another
thousand; it was forthcoming at 11SH.
So " far. so bad. Then he bid 117 for
2000 shares, and it was promptly sold.
But when he biS "117 for any part of
> 5000!" the crowd hesitated, the brokers
were not altogether sure Hayward was
, "good for It"; his ability to pay for the
stock was not undoubted. So Sally,
taking advantage of the hesitation, bid
17 1 ; and 117% for 5000 Sugar, at which
price "Billy" Thatcher, a two-dollar
-broker, sold it to him. It made 10.
500 shares Hayward had bought and
the stock had risen only V& points.
The shorts Were not frightened a wee
bit. But Sally was. He rushed out of
the crowd to his telephone and made
.a, pretense of "reporting" the transac
tions of his . office, as he would have
/done had they been-bona' fide Bur
chases. He " was followed by a hun
dred sharply curious â and curiously
sharp â They saw him hold the
telephone receiver to his ear with an
'expression of great interest, as If he
were listening to an important mes
; sage. But the only message he heard
was that of his heartbeats, that seemed
to say, almost articulately. "You have
; played and you have lost; you have
played and you have. lost. Therefore,
you are that much worse oft than be
fore. You must play again, and not
lose!"
He left his telephone and rushed
back to the Sugar crowd. He was less
excited, less like a drunken man; his
face . was no longer flushed, but pale.
And anon there flashed upon him the
t words. "Pike's â¢* Peak or bust." But
â¢ Pike's Peak glowed . dully. . feebly,
while the alternative was of a lurid
splendor. And he. blinked his eyes and
â¢ made a curious impatient 'motion with
his hand, ," as one. waves away an an
noying insect. Â»
- He gave an order for 5000 Sugar to
his friend Newton Hartley.
'Is this for 'yourself, Sally"' asked
Hartley.
."No. It's for one of lie biggest. men
in the street. Newt. Its all right. Ab
, solutely O. K."
And thus reassured. Hartley bought
the stock. The price was 118. The
â¢ seller would hold Hartley responsible
â¢ for the purchase, money if Hayward
â¢ "laid, down"â refused to pay.
Sally wiped his forehead twice,, quit*
unnecessarily. The shorts were not
stampeding., Any attempt to sell 'out
the 15.000 shares he had bought would
result only in depressing the price five
points at least-.. It was worse than bad
the outlook for him.
He gave another to buy "000 shares to
"Billy" Lansing, an old reliable two
dollar broker, but Lansins declined it.
He Â» tried another, but the order was
not ; accepted. They mistrusted him
but he 'could, not even bluster, for they
excused themselves on the ground of
having important orders elsewhere So
he. had recourse to another personal
friendâ J. G. Thompson.
"Joe, buy 6000 Sugar."
"Are you sober?" said Thompson se
riously. .>;7 * c
"See ; for yourself," said Bally laugh.

The man had noticed that the street
car conductors, and policemen, and gas

royal authority are seldom, addressed
in rude, unfeeling tones, and he de

To that end he launched himself into
the giddy political whirl ana gained at
one supreme leap the haughty pinnacle
of a seat in the Board of Aldermen.
Now, he murmured to himself* the be
ginning has begun. Surely the servant
of the city will be treated with proper
veneration. The first newspaper that
he picked up on the morning after the
first meeting of the board knocked ail
his illusions into something that would
have made a cocked hat look like a
meeting of the Law and Order Society.
The board had passed an ordinance to
allow the Cranberry Street Railway
Company to put in a new switch at
least twenty-flve feet long at the end
of the line and the Journalistic censors
in town rose somewhat as one man and
demanded to know how much they got
for it. To add to the sufferings of the
belabored Aldermen they hadn't re
ceived a cent for that particular piece
of business and so were reduced to the
extremity of paying for the music with
out having had the pleasure of even
one small dance.
But the Man took himself aside and

Everything pointed to fine weather

journeyed to Washington and took
his seat in UjÂ»e halls of Congress, or in

be. That venerable institution was
engaged in the time honored task of

The Man at once took strong ground
in favor of a higher duty on peanuts
fn order to build up one of the most
promising industries of the country.
He had no sooner done what he con
sidered was a highly laudable and pa
triotic act than every newspaper out
side of the peanut belt began to belt
him. He was assailed in display type
and editorial brevier, in cartoons and
special correspondence; his past life
was raked over with a flae toothed
comb and the fact was recalled to the
memory of a. horrified constituency
that he had been caught in a neigh

It was evident to all that he was a be

there was no hope of reclaiming him

art in gowning ones self in a manner

woman who studies herself can stamp
her individuality on everything she
wears.
But the woman with a. mission or

something that will make a greater

President if he had had the good
sense to have himself born in the
United States, particularly in Ohio;
his school teacher had told him that
a great many years ago and he had
often wondered that so few men had
thought of taking up the President
business as a steady thing. He had
read many histories of his beloved
country and he noticed that they al
ways spoke with praise of the chief
magistrates of the country, at least
of those who were dead. Therefore,
he argued, this must be the cinch that
he had been looking for so long. He
would go forth and round up the elec

gree awarded to him, honoris causa.

be promising for a peaceful reign. The
day had come when . he could sit in

a squad of special policemen.

L The intellect has o-ther powers,
wfcich must be considered briefly, at
irast. by those v ho wish to study, un
derstand or properly train a child.
These powers are memory, imagination,
conception, judgment and reasoning.
Unconsciously, the chiid who has
learned to know certain objects recog
nizes them to be the same as those
v hich he has perceived before. This
Is an act of memory. All other facul
ties of the mind, except memory, may
be trained by persistent acts of atten
tion to their objects. Not so with the
wonderful faculty of memory. Its four
acts of acquiring, retaining, recalling
and recognizing are all entirely self
acting and unconscious. We cannot by
any act of the will perform any of
the acts of memory. It is evident that
the memory also acts unconsciously, for
the mind does r.ot note that it has re
membered something.
Memory
Since memory is in no sense an act
of the will. It cannot be cultivated in
the same way as other faculties are
cultivated. It may. i we vet. be made
more accurate by frequent repetition.
The young child can forget what the
nursing bottle looks like. However, it
soon remembers because it smells,
tastes, touches and sees it frequently.
Since images once produced on the
mind tend to fade it should not be for
gotten that if you want a child to re
member anything it is necessary that
the attention be focused upon the
thought, and that there be much repe
tition. l*pon this will depend the dis
tinctness as well as the tenacity of the
memory.
The child cannot be expected to re
member unless the mental images are
frequently brought into his mind. This
is especially fo of those things learned
through the sense of hearing. For
this reason it is necessary to tell chil
dren more frequently than older peo-

the civilization of the, people. â¢
In a right condition of society the
ethical state of adults should be higher
and more advanced than that of chil
dren, on the average; that is to say,
training and experience of life should
have improved them. "With us at pres
ent I believe It is the reverse, and that
children, on the average, are born into
the world better than in a few years
they become; the majority seem to
have suffered deterioration, not eleva
tion, from their social surroundings;
their training has on the whole been
bad. I hope that this may be false,
but If it be true it is a grievous indict
ment against the conditions under
which we live.
Begin With the Children.
l
Our own children we scrupulously
protect from"' hostile Influences of all
sorta and take pains to place them
where they will receive good lmpres-
Kicns and right suggestions. In the
country it is possible that free com
n.union with nature may partially ac
complish this, but in the towns, and
for the great mass of mankind at pres
ent, nothing of the kind is physically
possible; the people are too poor and
100 busy to be able to give the neces
sary time and attention to their young
children born in a back street or In *
sunless court; they must perforce be
brought up amid those surroundings,
and must suffer the contamination of
overcrowded dwellings, oppressive at
mosphere, ugly conversation and some
limcs or drunken neighbors and
thoughtless if not vicious companions.
A' great responsibility rests, therefore,
on those commercial requirements and
those laws of landownershlp which
have brought large towns into being
and crowded the population into dense
tenements.
The result of the ugly, squalid, hard
preEEcd lif â¢ which the majority of peo
ple have to lead is that a minority of
them not only fail to advance, but go
back in the scale of civilization . to a
dangerous and intolerable extent; so
that an elaborate machinery of coer- ,
cion has to be employed In order to
' deal with the vice and ' crime ; which i
misery has to a large extent created.
pened about the same tlms will also
suggest each other.
Imagination is. In reality, another
form of memory. We remember cer
tain things, and by an act of memory
we recall the images. Sometimes we
arrange them differently from what we
have known them. When we thus
group ideas in new forms, unlike oth
ers, we perform an act of the imagin
ation. Thus the child imagines that
a man is as big as a tree, and he is
scared by the mental picture of the
giant. Thus a stick becomes a horse;
a chair an engine upon which to ride;
the dolls become alive and listen to all
that is told them, and answer as the
child desires them to. By this same
power the child at school sees upon
the map not merely black marks, but
rivers, mountains, lakes, cities and
other things which are not there.
The power of tanking depends
on the faculties of conception, judg
ment and reason. Conception is the
faculty which grasps and holds dis
tinctly the Idea which has been re
called from memory. To have a dis
tinct conception of any object It must
have been attended to closely and fre
quently. For this reason you are able
to see clearly an image of an apple. It
Is not easy to hold in the mind a pic
ture of some fruit seen but once, un
less it differs greatly from all others
or is attended to very closely.
Judgment is that activity of the
mind which examines, compares and
determines the likenesses or differ
ences between several objects or ideas
and then draws a conclusion.
Reason is that faculty of the mind
which compares two or more Judg
ments and then forms another Judg
ment based upon the previous con
clusions.
Conception
v 4*
From this very brief statement of
the characteristics of conception,
judgment and reason, it will be seen
that they depend upon the previous
development of other activities of the
mind. It is therefore unreasonable to
expect that even an older child will
have any considerable power of think
ing logically. Is it any wonder that
parents who do not understand these
fundamental truths make a most
serious mistake in finding fault with a
child for not being more thoughtful?
We are apt' to punish a child for the
most natural use of the senses and :
imagination, and are just as likely : to
find fault with him for not being able
to make use of faculties which the Al
mighty evidently did not intend should
reach full growth until quite late in
life.
Parents should therefore not expect
much in the way of the child's reason
ing as to what is best to be done. They
should cultivate and train this power.
Waste of Raw Material.
At present it is as though each forest
tree were so embedded in dark and un
wholesome vegetation at its root that
it cannot hold up its head to the sun
shine arid nourish in its own heaven
intended manner.
The wastefulness of human life is
analogous to the wastefulness of care
lessly burning crude coal in the midst
of a town, so as to distill a great part
of it into the atmosphere, thereby ex
cluding the more effective and vitaliz
ing rays of the sunshine by a cloud of
pestilent smoke, which not only has
coat much to produce, but also has the
effect of diminishing the healthfulness
of every human being who lives under
it. And the remedies at present~adopted
by society for dealing with its^overty
stricken and criminal population are
analogous to the efforts which a com
munity might make laboriously to col
lect and control and dissipate the
smoke, which it never ought to have
produced; thus taxing itself doubly
first, by the expense of producing the
evil; next by the expense of copins;
with it; whereas the more economical
and altogether pleasanter and happier
plan would be .o so organize matters
from the outset that the evil should
never have existed, except occasionally
here and there by an accident or by
causes beyond our control. If the evils
of large towns were really beyond our
control we might well be content to
sit still with folded hands and do noth
ing; but it is in the belief that these
evils are largely man-created, and can
most properly be dealt with by martâ
ihat remedial organizations exist. At
prÂ»-spnt they seem to me to deal too
much with palliatives; a more revolu
tionary reform Is needed, and although
no one individual can do very much,
and although I myself am already so
busy that It is hopeless for me to at
tempt to do anything, yet one who
clearly perceives that there is some
thing to be done is bound to give ut
terance to the views he holds, in the
hope that it may stimulate others, pos

the matter up more vigorously and
more lucidly than they do at present.

is indeed a right and hopeful way of
going to work, and I trust that in the

But there is much that may be done
in existing towns also.
At present a town ij governed by a

of lecal self-government has already

it is not difficult for one town to ad

men in the street. Some important de

"Sally, are you sure you've got an
order from some one else?" asked the
unconvinced broker. His incredulity
was obviously in the nature of an in

was too much at stake.
"Joe, come over to the office and I'll

I can advise you, as a friend, to buy

He wanted the commission of $100, but
he did not feel certain of his friend.
"Oh, hell, no. I've got a lot more to
buy. It's all right. Go ahead, Joe."
And Joe went ahead. He bought the
8000 shares. The stock rose to 119Vi.
and Hayward, warned by his experi
ence with Hartley and Thompson, did
not ask either friend or foe to buy an
other 5000 shares for him. What he
did was to distribute buying orders for
10,000 shares in lots of 500. Brokers now
accepted his orders, for they were not
so large as to be dangerous. And the
stock rose to 122%. A few shorts were

he paid cash, had to pay cash outright,
receiving the certificates forthwith, pre
sumably to hand over to some investor
of millions. Everybody on the "floor"
was talking: about Hayward. The en
tire market had risen in sympathy with
Sugar. ' .
But at 124 it seemed as if the entire
capital stock was for sale. He ceased
buying. He had accumulated 38,000
shares. To pay for the stock necessi
tated about six and a half millions.
But if he could unload on an average
of only 122 he might "come out even"
in his other troubles.
He gave an order to sell 10,000 shares
to a broker to whom he had always
been a good friend. It was a fatal mis
take. The broker, Louis W. Wechsler,
had previously sold 1000 shares to Hay
ward for "cash" at 122. He suspected
what was coming, and, declining the
order, he himself went to Hayward's
office and asked for a check. The cash
ier sought to put him off with excuse?,
and Wechsler, now being certain of
the true state of affairs, returned to
the board and began to sell Sugar short
for his own account. If a crash came
he would make instead of losing It.
Hayward was sure to be ruined, and
Wechsler told himself sophistlcally that
he was only profiting by the Inevitable.

the price had declined to 121%. But

to see municipalities go still further in
the positive direction, and instead of
merely licensing and repressing su..i
things as entertainments and drink

part of thÂ£m over, and manage them
also in the best interests Â» the people.

and the shorts recovered from their

proaching when Hayward would have
to settle. Pikes Peak or bust! He di-J,
indeed, need a veritable Pikes Peak of
dollars to pay for the 28,000 Sugar he
had on hand. So he busted.
â¢He threw up his hands. He acknowl
edged defeat to himself. The tension
was over. He was no longer excited,
but cool, almost cynical. On one of the
little slips of paper on which brokers
jot down memoranda of their transac
tions he scribbled a message in lead
pencil. It was his last official He, and
would cost Hartley and Thompson and
other friends, as well as his customers,
many thousands of dollars. It was as
follows:
"Owing to the refusal of their bank
to extend the usual facilities to them,
Hayward & Co. are compelled to an
nounce their suspension."
"Boy!" he yelled. And he gave the
bit of paper to one of the exchange
messenger boys in gray. "Take this to
the chairman."
And he walked slowly, almost swag
geringly, out of the New York Stock
Exchange â for the last time â as the
chairman pounded with his gavel until
the usual crowd gathered about the
rostrum and listened to the announce
ment of the failure of "Sally" Hay

phone boy and ended v a stock gam

which is destined to rule the child, but
must not place much reliance on It un
til maturity.
Many parents feel that they are
treating a child kindly when they are
permitting him to decide for himself.
Are such parents not generally mis
taken? Is it not true that it is much
easier for a child to do what he does
not like to do as an act of submission
â¢to authority rather than o do it as a
result of his own determination?
Many parents will keep a child In
misery for half an hour, and resort to
all sorts of arguments and bribes to
try to get him to take bitter medicine.
Tha better way would be to see that
the child takes It at once. Afterward
It might be well to express regret
that it was necessary to compel
ebedlence, and the hope that it would
Â¦oon not be necessary to take the un
pleasant medicine.
Reasoning
Many parents will ask. "Shall I
leave nothing to the judgment of my
child?" The answer must be, "Cer
tainly, but care must be taken not to'
permit him to give final decision con
cerning those things which it is not
safe to allow him to decide." There
are many things which may not only
be left to the child's judgment, but
which should be left to him to decide
for himself. He may be helped by
advice or by Information needed, but
should be free to decide. As he
grows older he should be given charge
of minor matters, and as he mani
fests good judgment the number and
character of the matters may well be
advanced. If such a plan be taken,
and encouragement be given for tho3o
decisions which are especially to be
commended, every will develop
better Judgment than' such a child
would show under different treatment.
If parents will discuss with older
children the principles involved in a
number of cases, the children will
gain most crrollent ideas and be
greatly helped in coming to correct
conclusions. All 'such discussions
should be carried on in a calm and
kind manner. The parents should be
careful to encourage the child to ex
press his own views, which should re
ceive most c reful consideration.
It is Indeed a very serious error In
the managing of children to permit
them to argue 1 favor of thftr being
allowed to do wl.at the parents know
is not only not best, but a thing which
they must forbid.
Having considered the intellectual
side of the mind, it is important that
we also give attention to the emotional
side asywell. The mind not only knows,
but It also feels and wills. Upon the
cultivation of the feelings will depend.
In great measure, the character of the
child, as well as his future happiness.
Puritanism.
Puritanism consists in the coercion of
other people. So far as a person finds
it necessary to coerce himself he is en
titled to do so; but if he tries to coerce
average people into his own ideal of
goodness he will fail, and he ought to
fail; he will not only fail, but he will
be doing harm by the attempt. People
should be drawn, not pushed. I say
there are good folk wiser than Provi
dence. I feel sure that if some folk had
made the world they would not have
filled it with people of both sexes and^
left them to themselves to arrange
their own affairs and the system under
which they chose to live; they would
have preferred to put the men on one
side of the planet and the women on
the other, and would have re
stricted the conditions under which
they should meet. So we find it in some
churches, perhaps for good reasons, I
am no judge; so we find it in some so
cial institutions and in schools. So we
shall be likely to find it in any suggest
ed municipal institution. It is a diffi
cult question, and not one on which I
wish to dogmatize, but it may be per
missible to throw out suggestions in a
serious discussion like this. That men
should prefer one sort of conversation
or entertainment or game, and women
another, is to some extent natural, and
may be provided for by separate club
rooms and recreation grounds; but why
should there not be one large room
where both sexes could freely meet in
public after the day's work is done?
Why should not young people, with
their families, have reasonable oppor
tunities for forming friendships other
than those provided by loitering about
in streets and lanes? Courtship is not
prevented by making it difficult and
uncomfortable; and why on earth
should it be prevented? The more open
and above board it is, the better. Nor
do I see that anything is gained by the
closing on Sunday of most places of
public resort except houses specially
licensed for the sale of drink. It is true
that in many towns galleries and libra
ries are partially open, but in some
they are not; and more might be done
than Is done at present in that direc-
More Public Institutes.
I would have social institutes with
large public rooms, games, entertain
mentsâanything that the people could
provide for themselves, or that might
be provided for themâ and leave them
By the feelings or the emotions is
meant the excitement which accom
panies certain ideas. They produce
either pleasure or pain. When emo
tions become very strong and pass be
yond control they are called passions.
Among the more common phases of
emotion may be mentioned love, faith.
Icar. Joy. grief, anger, surprise and
others.
Feelings
Those feelings which are p!ea3ant
produce desire 3. When unpleasant they
give rise to aversions. When tho ex
pected pleasure becomes great enough
to impel to Voluntary action, it be
comes a motive. In this way arise mo
tive whicli influence the will, and
thereby determine action. One who is
carried away by his emotions i 3 apt to
be> so impulsive as to be very hard tÂ»
control.
Most mental powers develop gradu
ally and do not arrive at maturity until
quite late. Such Is especially the case
with the power of reason. However,
the emotions of children seem to be
strongest when they art young. Some
times children are so emotional that
they are considered eccentric. Those of
us who, for years, have schooled our
selves in the .repression of our reefing*
should make every allowance for chil
dren who show their feelings. WÂ»
should certainly make more allowance
for them than for adults, a3 their emo
tions are characterized by greater in
tensity. When a child is overpowered
by his feelings they are likely to have
complete mastery of his mental facul
ties as well, and he appears stupid.
Where very intense, they even paralyse
the bodily powers. How utterly sense
less, then, the person who expects a
child laboring under great emotion to
think or act as would the child under
normal conditions. V ' do we parents
not often expect this very thing?
Emotions
The control of the emotions is such a
difficult problem that even adults find
it a slow process. It is even more diffi
cult with children. A child of emo
tional nature cannot be cured of his
displays of feelings, except through the
affections. The parent who gives way
to outburst of passion will only add
fuel to the fire burning in the child's
soul. By diverting the mind with a
story, by a display of love, by the
use of tact, and in many other ways,
much can be done to help the child
gain a mastery over his feelings. In
place of permitting his feelings to rule
him. It must ever be kept in mind that
the child of strong feelings not only
has the power of loving intensely, but
has also the capacity for great hatred.
Unkindness to a child suffering from
any strong emotion has a tendency to
embitter him as such treatment would
not, at other times.
to the good sense and natural feelings
of each other. Subject to actual expe
rience under good conditions In the op
posite directions, I should say: Let
drink of every kind be provided for
sane adults, but let there be food also,
and let there be no profit on the drink,
especially not on alcoholic drink,
to those who retail it. Let it be ob
tainable, but not too easily and obtru
sively obtainable, nor in any way forced
upon people. There Is no sense in the
present system, whereby overdrinking
is encouraged as the only way to se
cure good fellowship and comfortable
housing during the hours of play. Thers
are the theaters, it la true â where peo
ple are crowded, uncomfortable, rele
gated to back seats, and with the lia
bility to have to stand in queues for a
long time before the doors are open.
This is a horrible waste of time. If
theaters are not crowded at the present
day they do not "pay." This necessity
for "pay" is detrimental to any fona
of ai;t.
Government Saloons.
m There ought to be at least onÂ«
municipal theater where there shall be
room and comfort for all at low prices,
without necessarily having to go in at
the beginning, or Ions; before the be
ginning, and where reasonable plays
can be exhibited and songs sung, even
if they do not attract constantly crowd
ed houses. The entertainment and
recreation of the people after their
day's toil is too important a matter to
be left wholly to private enterprise; it
is not a thing that should be exploited
by individuals for private gain: that is
not the way to secure entertainments
of a high class. The supply of intoxi
cating liquor also is not a matter that
should be conducted for private profit;
it is too serious a thins; for the welfars
of a nation. A man who has labored
hard all day with his body is naturally
thirsty; he requires liquid, and In this
climate he imagines that he require*
some stimulant. I sympathize with
him. but whether he is right or wrong
it is extremely little use coercing or re
straining his body without controlling
or guiding his intelligence and will; un
less indeed he is already in a diseased
condition. Too many are in that con
dition, but the young surely are not.
and there lies our hope; a new genera
tion may be brought up under whole
somer and more natural conditions, and
the deadly diseased craving for over
doses of any form of drug. Instead of
having to be curbed and eradicated,

CALAMITIES AND FAITH

_y strikes into our lives which
J f raises afresh the old question,
'* \* "How can Buch things happen
when an all-powerful and all
loving God is supposed to exist?" It
may be a great public tragedy like a
railway accident or a theater fire.
Quite as likely It may be some private
grief of which the man In the next
street never hears. "How can God
bear it?" groaned Oliver Wendell
Holmes once when his great heart
was overwhelmed with a sense of the
misery and pain in the world.

explain. But the human mind was
given up to use and if we can find
even the rudiments of an explanation
which may appeal to our Intelligence
as well as our faith we are bound to
seek them.
We shall never have any better an

of this universe to his human crea

sometimes let him find out by sad ex
perience that fire burns, that a knife

kind of a child would you hfive if you
safeguarded him and so padded his
surroundings that he never felt the
rough, hard, painful side of life; if
you dissuaded him from the cold
plunge in the morning because the
first shock was unpleasant; if you
never let him find out for himself
that wrong doing brings its inevitable
penalty?
What kind of a universe should we
have If men could go on transgressing
known laws, winking slyly at public
statutes designed to preserve life, If
men could trample upon rational, pre
cautionary measures and never be
brought summarily up to a fearful
judgment. This universe is sound to
the core. The tremendous physical
forces in it, like fire and electricity, are
meant to bless and not to curse man
kind. But each child as it grows up
has to learn for himself what Is per

handle the forces of hia own nature
and of the universe and at what points
he may not transgress boundaries that

tratlon of the effect of this vicarious
element that runs like a scarlet thread
through all human history. No one
ever deserved less than he to suffer
at all, and perhaps no one ever did suf
fer as much. That was because he
bound himself to the lot of men. He
took the chances of his humanity. And
If brotherhood means anything In the
modern world, we must take what It
Involves of suffering as well as oi

brethren simply for the benefits I may
get out of It.
Yes. but why should Qod allow my
friend to be sacrificed In that Chicago
holocaust? He was just passing through
the city and stopped off for an after
neon's pleasure. Why did not God
direct his feet to some other place of
amusement? For an answer we must
fall back again upon the analogy of
the human fatherhood. But no human
father who could have foreseen the is
sue would have allowed his child to go
to the ill-fated building that afternoon.
Hold a minute. "If my mother loved
me," reasons the little child "she would
never go away and leave me." "If my
father loved me," says the boy In his
early teens, "he would never send my
older brother away to a boarding school
and make me so lonely thereby." We
do not know why God takes away those

HUGH GRANTLEY'S VALENTINES
"Wno brought it â this h;imper?" he
flpmanded excitedly, confronting the
old butler at the door. "Call him
bark. Don't stand there staring! Call
him back. I say!"
Peter, his mind totally upset by his
master's excitement, started to go â
: back â started again, and then
came to a full slop.
"Its no use. Mr. Hugh!" he quav
erM at last. It's no use. because the
man came i:i a sleigh and started on"
again 'fore I closed the door. '
His master stared at him in speech
less impatience for a moment, then
turned back to the table where the
still lay. a veritable sleeping
beauty in miniature.
"Sen<l Mary to me!" h? directed
briefly, and. moved by some impulse
that he could not explain, he reached
out and drew off one of the absurd
little bags that served the infant for
mittens.
As the tiny rink and white hand,
â¢with its fingers curled under, lay in
his great brown one. a strange thrill
traveled along his spine. He had never
dreamed of a touch so utterly appeal
ing. His intention of sending for the
authorities to i-ome and remove the
child melted like snow before the sun.
A very vosiderful thing had happened.
Hugh Grantley had fallen in love for
the first time in his lif? â not with a
woman, but with a helpless, pink and
white morsel of humanity. If, five
minutes earlier, he had felt only a.
fierce resentment at the Impudence
that had foisted this child upon him.
he now felt that he woull fight, if
need be, to retain it.
"Please, sir. I am here." said the
voice of the housekeeper. Grantley
dropped the baby's hand as if he had
suddenly found it a live coal, and, with
the air of a man emerging from a
dream, he remarked with a non-com
mittal air:
"< Â»b. yes!" â¢
Then he remembered why he had
sent for her and continued as natural
ly, as Mary remarked to Peter after
ward, "as if having babies left at the
door was an everyday affair "
"Take it to your room. Mary, and see
if you can find any mark on its cloth
ing â any clew to its identity."
In an incredibly sh^rt time she re
turned, but not before he had deter
mined to keen the bny at all hazards.
'I . ould find nothing, sir â no mark
of any kir, i. " she said, laying the child
back in the hamper as if f_^ wanted to
get rid of it before she incurred any
responsibility. "The clothes are fine,
but very plain, and there's no mark of
any sort upon them '
"Why doesn't he wake up? " demand
ed Grantley abruptly, struck by the
fact that through all of this commotion
the child had continued to sleep.
"I think It's been drugged, sir. But
she's a beautiful child. Eir. She â "
"She!" was Grantleys horrified ejac
ulation. "You don't mean to tell me it's
a girl!" and the dismay of his tone was
enough to make the fates themselves
repent r 'f having played so low a trick
upon a man whose dominant trait had
always been his shyness of women.
"A glri:" he repeated limply.
The whole fabric of his dreams was
shattered in a moment. One couldn't
go traveling about the world with a
girl. One couldn't hunt and flsh and
smoke with a girl! Obviously, since
the child was a girl would have t<>
be turned over to the authorities.
But no sooner had he reached this
conclusion than a revulsion of feeling
same over him. He felt again the ex
quisite touch of that tiny, rosa-leaf
hand, realizing that Its hold upon him
was but the stronger for what he had
learned. He fancied now that he could
Fred, disconsolately. "I hardly know
anything about him. He was father's
godson In the first place, and the son
of father's partner who died. 80 father
gave him his first start out West, and
when I came along he was my god
father by proxy, and no one ever heard
r>f him afterward until I got that let
ter last week. I had no idea he was
coming on."
"It's too bad you aren't a boy, Will,"
he said with regretful cheerfulness.
"But as long as you're not you'll have
to stand it. and so will Mr. Wilfred
Norman. Maybe he'll like you Just the
same."
"I don't want him to like me."
"Maybe he's rich," ventured Ralph,
hopefully. "Never can tell when a fel
low goes West how he will turn out.
Better not get sassy."
"Oh, it isn't that. You can't under
stand"â She paused vaguely.
"Yes, I do, too," retorted Ralph.
"You're worried to death for fear he'll
come here and find out we're as poor
as Job's turkey."
"I'm not."
"Yes, you are, too. And you're afraid
the old boy'H kick up a rumpus because
there's just you and mammy and me
living here, keepiae bachelor's hall,
and you're working yourself to death
on a newspaper for a living. Why
don't you write nnd tell him that the
football team you're halfback on has a
match on with Cleveland and you won't
be h^me for two weeks?"
Wilfred i*hooic her head resolutely.
I'll see him. and we'll ask him
to dinner and thank him for his old
dead deer, but that's all. I won't listen
to a particle of dictating from him."
Valentine's eve was clear. It had
stormed all day and cleared at night
fall. Wilfred was tired from the day's
work and with a pleasurable, perversity
declined "dressing tip" as Ralph termed
it.
"Better make a good impression," he
feel the tiny fingers clinging to his.
Without further hesitation he sat down
and dashed off a note to his cousin's
counseled sagely. "The old boy may
be afflicted with enlargement of the
heart and leave us a legacy. Anyhow,
you don't look so bad, Will, in a skirt
waist."
Wilfred smiled at his tone of serious
consolation and took a swift glance at
herself in the mirror over the mantel.
There was more than a chance of mak
ing a good impression In the reflected
figure, trim and business like in black
and white, without even a bit of chif
fon to give a touch of femininity.
The electric bell buzzed sharply in
the hall, and Ralph bolted for the door.
An Instant's reconnoitering over the
banister, and he put his head back for
a final stage whisper.
"Here he comes, sis. Look pleasant,
please."
Wilfred listened. Somebody was
asking for Mr. Wilfred Gray. And
Ralph, the traitor, had said, "Yes, sir,"
and was ushering him in without ex
planations. She rosa at sight of the
figure in the doorway, and a wave of
embarrassment swept over her. She
had thought of him as 60, a general
study In iron gray, with disposition to
match. He was not over 35. Tall and
fair, with a sturdy Saxon fairness, and
gray eyes that met her own In amaze
ment. From the hall came the sound
of Ralph's swiftly departing footsteps.
"I am looking for Mr. Wilfred Gray,"
he said.
"I am Wilfred." She hesitaed, try
ing to cover her confusion with dig
nity. "I should have written and told
you, but we thought â I thought â you
would not come, and it really did not
matter "
"But it does matter a great deal," he
interposed. "That black-tall "
I She smiled up at him, eyes full of
sudden mirth.
"I gave It to the Janitor."
"And my letter. Great Scott! I've
always thought you were a boy, you
know. Your father simply said he had
named the baby after me, and I was

pressing matter? And so i^ was ar

its godfather. I w.as too much of a kid
myself then to care enough about It to
make further Inquiries. But now "
"You wanted me to show you the
town?" Wilfred suggested demurely.
"I wanted you for my partner," he
returned shortly, as Ralph came saun
tering Into the room.
It was two months later. He had met
her uptown, coming from a preliminary
view and write-up of the trousseau of
a noted society girl, whose Easter wed
ding was to be a feature in the Sunday
paper. She was tired, but happy, as
they turned Into the park, a mass of
soft greens and delicate violet vistas in
its springtime beauty.
He had been talking ever since they
had left Fifth avenue, and she was still
silent.
"It does not matter In the least over
the mistake," he said. "Half of the
mine is yours by right, yours and
Ralph's. It was your father's money
that started me out there and his back
ing that enabled me to develop the
mine. I never heard of his failure and
death until three months ago, and then
I made up my mind to come back East
and give his boy the help which he had
given to me."
He paused. A broad flight of stone
steps led down from the white stone
bridge over the driveway. Wilfred
turned from the walk and led the way
down them.
"I like it here," she said. "Whenever
I am tired over the eternal write-ups
and have to cross the park I rest here.
There is a little iron fountain, and a
curved Roman seat that looks as if it
came from one of Alma Tadema's pic
turesâyou know the kind â and the sun
shine slants down from above, and it's
all white and cool and quiet as an Ital
ian garden grotto. Let's rest here."
He waited until they had reached the
place, and she leaned her head back
on tha old seat, and smiled up at him.
He atood beside the fountain, silently
ranged that the child should remain as

flngrerlngr the chain of one of the drink
ing ladles. The late afternoon sunshine
shone on his bared head, giving a tinge
of gold to the short cropped hair.
She looked at him with a Quiet,
happy satisfaction in her eyes. He
was good to look at when one was
tired, and somewhat lpncsome.
"I am going back West next week,"
he said at length. "You must answer
me, Wilfred. Even for Ralph's take
you should not refuse. Instead of this
steady grind of work, you could send
him to college, and give him the oppor
tunities his father's son should have."
She shook her head.
"It may be right for Ralph. You are
-' ry kind to him, but what about his
father's daughter?"
He answered her almost roughly.
"I don't know. She is an indepen
dent young person, who positively re
fuses to accept her opportunities."
"The mine?"
"And its owner." .
"If it were only the owner "
He could hardly catch the words, but
bent over her, crushing her hands in
his grasp.
"Wilfred, Is It only the money that
stands between, sweetheart?"
She looked up at him with troubled,
tell-tale eyes.
"If there was not so much of it "
"There'll only be half as much after
ward. The rest goes to my partner."
An old man with a roll of music un
der his arm and a daffodiK stuck in his
threadbare lapel, descended the white
stone steps leisurely, humming a bar
or two of Mignon to himselfâ
"Now I stand in Beauty's bower,
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, tra-la-la-la<-la â "
He stopped short at sight of two fig
ures In the sunshine beside the foun
tain, and softly went back up the steps
to the drive with smiling lips and ret
rospective eyes.
"Birds a-matinf," he said, In a
mumbled undertone, "God bless them
all."
KEITH GORDON
dut the flays that had come and gone
between that distant evening and the
present one seemed to Hugh Grantley
like the links of a long, bright chain.
Loosely speaking, it was Valentinas
eighteenth birthday, and the old
Grantley home, once so quiet and de
serted, now wore an air of gay fes
tivity in honor of the event. Soft
lights flooded the rooms, greenery and
blooms transformed it into a charmed
place.
In the library the master of the house,
whose gray hairs but made him the
more distinguished, sat once more be
fore the fire, lost in thought. Owing to
that physical perversity that sometimes
makes a man appear old when he Is
young and youthful when he is middle
aged, Grantley looked but little older
than on that fateful night eighteen
years ago.
Still something ,of the old sadness
gripped his heart. Love had stolen
upon him when he thought himself im
mune. Though he did not confess it
even to himself, in the depths of his
soul he knew that he loved Valentina,
not as a guardian or father, but as a
man loves the woman he could make
his wife.
There was a rustle of skirts behind
him, like the passing of a breeze, and
two soft hands were pressed gently
over his eyes. They fell like rose leaves,
but every nerve in his body trembled
at the touch, and with set teeth he
prepared to play his part. She must
\iever know.
"Guess now who holds thee?" com
manded a laughing voice, and Grantley,
with an Inward "Steady, old fellow,"
replied In questioning tones, to the hu
mor of the lines â
"Death?"
There was something electric in the
air. Was It the beating of her heart
that he could hear or only the mad
throbbing of his own? Would she fin
ish the quotation?
With a mighty effort he tried to
steady himself â to remember that to
her he must seem an old man.
With lingering slowness the soft
fingers trailed away from his eyes and
at the same time he heard thcgirlish
VINY'S VALENTINE.
Ortho B. Senga

ISS VINY PERKIN9
closely scanned tha
stock of valentines,
giving careful perusal
to the verses at
tached. There were
the usual rhymes
about hearts and
darts, and love and dove, but none
"What's the matter. Miss Vlny. can't
you find nothin' you like? Shell have
some more in termorrer, some with lace
paper, all rigged up like a bay-winder." t
'Well, I'll come in again, " and Miss
Viny passed lingeringly out of the lit
tle country store.
"I don't s'pose any of "em would say
just what I want," she murmured
thoughtfully, as she went up the lane.
I wiafc I could make up some po'try
myself, then I'd hava somethin" that'J
hit the mark. "
The thought seemed to please her and
she hurried into the house.
"As soon as I git dinner over and
Jason starts for the gristmill I'll put
my mind onto it. The Idea of a full
grown man beln' so scart as Silas Simp
sonâit's time somebody took him in
hand!"
Well for Miss Vlny's peace of mind
that she could not know that a similar
remark was at that instant being made
by Silas Simpson's sister.
"It's time somebody took yxmin hand.
Silas Simpson; here you've been goin'
to tee Viny Perkins for nigh 'on to
eleven years. Why don't you spunk up
and ask her?" â¢
"Well, Mandy," chattered Silas, de
fensively, "I've been kinder tryin' to
lead the conversation up to it â "
"Humph:" Mrs. Thompsoif ejacu
lated, derisively.
"I've beea into the store to-day look-
In' at valentines," affirmed Silas, still
on the defensive.
"Valentines: " uttered hfs sister, with
stinging sarcasm, "you'd better hang
yourself for a valentine. 'Twould be
the smartest thing you could do."
The sarcasm was lost, but the idea
found lodgment in t:ie slow-moving
brain of Silas. Meadeville customs de
manded that a valentine must be at
tached to the knob or knocker of the
front door, and the giver was supposed
to be entirely unknown to the fair re
cipient. Any sighing swain who sought
the aid of Uncle Sam in conveying his
tender missive would have been deemed
cowardly, to say nothing of the opinion
that would have prevailed, from an
economic standpoint, regarding the
purchase of stamps for such a purpose.
The more Silas thought of himself as
a valentine the more attractive hÂ«
considered the idea. He went about,
filling the woodbox and doing the other
chores requisite on the approach of a
cold night and fancied himself a shiv
ering Cupid, with wings and arrow and
bow.
"That'll settle it," he exclaimed hap
pily, unconscious that he was speaking
aloud, "if Viny takes me in. why I'll
be her valentine â if Viny takes me In."
"Yes, and then shell be taken in."
muttered Mrs. Thompson, giving the
biscuit dough an extra poke, adding
hastily, as if repenting her momentary
disloyalty, -however, Silas is a mighty
good pervider. if he is slow, and a
pleasanter spoken man, take him by
and large, never lived. "
Mrs. Thompson would have been re
luctant to confess that the probably
lonely state of Jason Perkins, in the
event of his sister's marriage, had
often preyed upon her mind, and that
as often she had thought of herself as
being a likely person to succeed Miss
Viny as the mistress of Jason's fine old
home and broad acres. Airy, fairy cas
tles, under which no solid foundation
of reality could ever be placed unless
M
tuice saying â a trifle unsteadily.
"Not death, but love. "
There was a vibration in the voice
that he had never heard before â a
tone at once triumphant and shamed.
He opened his eyes and faced Valer.
tina with a face drawn and rigid with
feeling.
"I don't understand you," he said
slowlyâ sternly, and before the sever
ity of his manner she drooped like a
flower in the frost. But only for a
moment. Then her head went up
proudly and her eyes met his with the
old childish confidence.
"I love you." she said simply.
But Grantley had himself well in
hand now, and he spoke in a manner
at once elderly and paternal. ,
"My dear child â "
Before he could go further Valen
tina stopped him, Â¦
"Please let me take the little cas^
that you carry in your left breasr
pocket." she demanded.
A guilty blush overspread hiÂ» face
So she knew. then, that he carried
there a baby's mitten, turned to the
shade of old ivory with. age.
"I am too old for you. my darling."
he said brokenly â but in another mo
ment she was in his arms, protesting
that it was she who was so disgust
ingly young.
"But how did you know, dear?" he
questioned later, when they ha! dis
posed of the question of years and
gray hairs. "How did you know that,
against my judgment and in. spite of
myself, I loved you?"
"I came down to the library late
one night for a book. My slippers
made no sound and â " she kjad hid
her face in his shoulder â "I saw you
take the little mitten and press it to
your lips."
And so for the second time In his
life St. Valentine brought a great hap
piness.
Silas could be "braced up" to a |
posing point.
That night an inquisitive moon, ris
ing soft over thÂ» hilltops, looked down
into the peaceful valley, and tHe moon
was the only one that saw Silas Simp
son as he hurried toward the Perkins
farm with his sister's big? pollow
clothes basket over hfs shoulder. ThÂ«
curious moon veered around the bi?
pine tree and watched Silas as he ad
justed the ropes that were attached to
the handles of the basket over thÂ»
doorknob, arranging for the basket to
rest on the upper step.
"A most singular proceeding," com
mented the watching moon.
But at Silas" next move the moon
nearly coflapsed, for Silas pinned a
paper to his coat sleeve and, doubling
his awkward body Into the basket.
reached up and clanged the big brass
knocker.
Alone m the bright, warm kitchen.
Miss Viny started to her feet at the
sound of the knocker.
"A valentine"' she exclaimed; "well.
I'll give 'em a chance to scoot. I
don't want to ketch nobody."
She went slowly through the sitting
room into the entry and, pushing back
the bolt, essayed to open the door. It
was apparently held from the outside.
Grasping the knob with both hand?,
she gave a tremendous pull. The door
flew open, bringing the basket with it.
and emptying Its contents in an un
dignified tangle at Miss Viny's feet.
"For the land sake!" she cried,
"whatever possessed you, Silas Simp
son?"
Silas scrambled to his feet and point- ,
ed to the paper on his sleeve, which
bore in large letters the name, "Miss
Viny Perkins."
"I knew I'd never git my courage up
to offer myself to you in any other
way. Viny. and so I thought f I
your valentine."
"And a prÂ»tty mess you've made of
it. as usual. " said Miss Viny, sharply.
He raised his head manfully; some
thing very tender, almost noble, came
over the dull features and straightened
the awkward body. "I shan't mak^
any blunders in lovin' you and takin 1
care of you, Viny. " he said simply.
A strange, new feeling of submission
crept into Miss Viny's heart.
"You come in here. Silas, and Til
show you what I was Just goln' la
send you. I made it myself," sh*
added, as she handed him an envelope
addressed to "Silas Simpson. "
He drew out the sheet of paper care
fully. A bis red heart was pasted at
the top and the lines below were in
Miss Viny's cramped, but legible, hand
writing. He read aloud slowly, in a
high-pitched, sing-sons tone that in his
school days had always been reserved
for poetry:
If Silas Simpson me will wed.
No further groans or tears I'll shed.
But hurry 'round, as best I'm able.
To cook his meals and set the table.
Now, Silas, speak, and I'll say "Yes."
No need of waiting lon#, I guess;
A month from now and I'll be ready
To hold your hand before Parson
Steady.
"You cut out that heart?" he laid,
hesitatingly, putting a thick forefinger
on the scarlet representation.
Miss Viny nodded, watching his face
with unwonted timidity.
"But the verses â they ain't yours, be
they?" in an awed tone.
"Yes. they be." affirmed Miss Viny.
tasting for the first time the delighu
of authorship.
Silas gazed at her in silent admira
tion.
"I writ 'em in a hurry," she explained
modestly (Oh, the trail of the serpent!),
"mebbe if I'd taken more timeâ"
"Viny." interrupted Silas with eon
victlon, "I never seen any better po'try

BROWN IS TO BE THE COLOR EASTER
THOUGH Easter may be a long
Â¦nay off on the calendars, it is
not so very far away, judged
by the sewing room of the mo
distes. Here Easter finery lies
ralore upon the chairs and clothes
Jesses are fairly bulging with its gay
eties.
Ikm is no denying the fact that it
i* to be a very gay Easter. The leader
of New York society tacitly admitted
it when she ordered six new gowns, no
one of which was to be any darker
than a wood brown. They were in tan.
berry red. French blue, cream colored.
Â¦ burnt bread and brown. And these
colon, it may be taken for granted,
will be the colors of spring, never for
getting the ever present violet.
X dyed lace waist of brown was a
very pretty thing, made over a brown
taffeta lining. And this was worn with
a brown broadcloth skirt which was of
the old-fashioned rich seal brown.
An Easter bride, who dresses very
smartly, will have a brown cloth skirt
and with it three or four brown blouses
of brown lace, brown moire, brown lou
isine and brown taffeta. Another bride
will have a lovely brown taffeta suit.
all embroidered by hand and trimmed
with bands and Persian . embroidery.
The buttons are covered with Persian
silk set in little rims of silver.
But it is to be a spring of littles.
Gowns will depend for their prettiness
upon their decorations. Plain street
suits will be glorified with large brass
buttons that shine like the sun and
are sun-shape, namely, round, with a
shank on the under side by which they
are sewed to the gown. Again one will
see a berry red dress trimmed with
buttons of carved ivory so cut and
stained that they are dark in the deep
est part of the cutting, looking exactly
like antiques.
As every erne knows, the cameo has
long s^ice been impressed into the jewel
servicf. It is used for buttons, for stick
pins, and now it is set In a little gold
rim and so arranged that it can be
sewed into the yoke of the gown as
an ornament. It is a very fortunate
spring for those who have a handful
of old cameos in the house, and if these
be in different shades of pink and
brown, of different sizes and^executed
with different workmanship, then tha
elegance of the yoke is almost assured.
Gowns that are worn without coats
will sport some very fancy yokes. They
are not necessarily of lace, but can
be of shillings, or of applications, or
the yokes can be little accordion plaited
capes fastened to the stock and al
lowed to fall over the shoulders. This
is a charming little style for the grace
ful woman.
Trimming the Shoulders.
A young woman who dresses a great
deal ha? half a dozen little accordion
plaited capes about three fingers deep,
â¢which she secures to a ribbon stock
and fastens around the throat. They
give the finishing touch to the gown
and are specially useful* for raising the
. when the dress has been cut de
collete.
It is? really remarkable to note how
the trimming is being pushed off the
shoulders. It is sagging lower and
Itver, until it finds expression in the
Â¦leevt-F. which are a mass of ruffles
around the elbows and the wrists. Cer
tain bodices are almost plain as to the
stock and perfectly plain as to the
yoke. But when it comes to the shoul
therc if a tiny f^at epaulet. Then
cone the ruffles, and by the time the
wrist is reached the elbows and wrists
are one great fluffy mass of lace and
chiffon, of soft, flying silks, all knife
plaited, of the most delicate dotted net
and of ribbon ends.
Nor are these fancy sleeves peculiar
to the silk gown alone, for they are a
failure of the cloth dress as well.
Â¦ :.g dresses of rather somber cloth
are made glorious with deep dotted
plaitings. which fall from the elbow
down over the hand, coming out of
the sleeve in one great cascade at the
wrist.
There is no doubt that it is to be a
velvet spring; for the new velvets are
not only beautiful in color, but deli
cate in texture. They are, many of
them, quite as thin as ladies cloth
and there are a few expensive grades
that are very delicate indeed and are
called chiffon velvet, though they are
by no means as thin as chiffon.
When velvet can be made thin
without losing Its stateliness and can
be so built that it is practicable for all
wear from calling to dancing, and
from house gowns to dinner gowns,
then, indeed, velvet has reached a cer
tain triumph of art.
A Brown Visiting Gown.
A visiting gown of a warm brown
tan velvet was a very showy thing. It
was quite plain In that it was made
on shirt waist lines, with a round waist
and a round skirt. The skirt, by the
way, was one of the straight-gored
ones, with narrow plaitings around
the hips to be immediately released in
the skirt part. The waist was a blouse
waist.
The waist was trimmed with escu
rial lace, put on in the form of incrusta
tions. The figures were cut out and
the lace applied. Then, around the
idge of the lace pieces there was a lit
tle border of jewels. These were of
the mock jewel variety and could be
sewed through and through, like but
tons.
The girdle plays an important part
in the new gowns. One of the hand
somest of girdles is made upon a
foundation of bone and crinoline. The
front is very deep and is boned and
the back is treated in the same way.
The front is made of folds which cross
and come up high under a series of lit
tle knots of ribbon. The back is fin
ished with a very long chiffon scarf
whose ends tie in the back.
Another girdle, this one intended for
street wear, is made of very light
weight velvet, lined with velvet, so that
it is two sided. A wide band of the
velvet is brought around the waist and
tied in a knot# while the ends hang
down to the foot of the gown. Then
another piece of velvet comes, around
the waist, is tied in a knot high be
tween the shoulders, and the ends hang
down again, almost trailing upon the
floor.
The appearance of the girdle almost
indicates that it is to be a sash sum
mer and, in fact, the first of the sum
mer dresses all seem to have sashes
of one kind or another. And here is
where chiffon comes in handy, for the
chiffon sash sets off a gown so very
well.
A gown which was built of biscuit
colored ladles' cloth had a sash of bis
cuit colored chiffon doubled. This sash
was edced with a ruching of plaited
satin ribbon put on so es to border the
chiffon sash a'i the way around.
Those who like the appearance of the
sash and find it becoming will discover
that it is much better when it is trim
med around the edge with something
substantial, such as a plaiting of rib
bon or of satin, for in this case it will
not blow up as it otherwise would.
The Spring Girl in Golden Brown. .
A lovely, lovely brown for the girl
of spring is made of golden brown
broadcloth. It is sweep length and is
a visiiins gown, being far too long
and too pretty for shopping or pedes
trian wear.
The skirt, which Is made upon the
plainest lines, is trimmed with long
stitched bands of brown broadcloth erf
the same material as the gown. These
bands are cut in points and are so long
that they reach from the belt right
down to the bottom of the gown, where
they are finished in sharp points, each
point fastened with a big brass but
ton. The skirt needs no other trim
ming than this, for it is a kind of trim
ming which carries its own dressiness
with it. â¢
The upper part of this suit, which
is one worn by one of the Vanderbllt
women, was cut as an Eton, which
closely fitted the figure. It was trim
med with stitched bands of broadcloth,
each one finished with a brass button.
And these bands, somehow, produced
the effect of a box plaiting.
The sleeves were very wide and very
full and were brought in at the hand
into a wide cuff, which was split open.
This cuff had four brass buttons.
In all of these visiting costumes a
fine sleeve effect is produced by the
very wide plaiting around the hand.
The lingerie cult it is called, and all
materials from the durable and wash
able lawn to the delicate chiffon are
employed In its manufacture.
The most useful and the prettiest
from a tailor point of view of the
lingerie cuffs are produced by making
the ready made knife plaiting, which
comes at about 75 cents a yard, and
buying enough of It to sew into the
sleeves. It does not take a great deal
and the result is marvelously good. Of
course, the trouble is to keep these

lingerie cuffs immaculate. But it can
be done alter a few talks with a white
goods cleaner.
One woman who wears the *ong white
ruffles at her sleeve of lace, and of
plaited tulle, and of lawn, and of taf
feta, and what not, makes it her prac
tice on taking them off to rub chalk
lightly through the lacy parts. The
whole Is now done ur> >n blue tissue
paper, as this Is said to preserve the
tone of the lace better than anything
else. "S*
There it a marvelous chapter to be
written upon' the scenting of laces, and
th* woman who is keen on the subject
can acescent her lace that it will smell
as though It just came out of the lav
ender chest. This is done by keeping
It In a chest which Is lined and scented
with lavender, and to keep thÂ» lavender
fresh reauires some addition to the
chest every week.
On* of the most charming little ef
fects of the whole year was produced
by a woman who wore a visiting gown
of black, all black, with the inevitable
trimming of very fancy buttons. There
was a little shoulder cape, for It was a
two-piece suit. But the front was open,
and this gave an opportunity for the
display of a very fancy vesting.
This woman, who is very deft, took a
French model and copied it exactly.
She made a little vest of white broad
cloth, which she embroidered by hand
down the front In military fashion, us
ing gold silk, gold braid and small
brass buttons. The buttons were caught
with little straps of silk braid and
white silk braid was used in the em
broidery scheme. This way of trim
ming a white vest front is heartily rec
ommended to the woman who Is going
to wear a plain cloth sult^or spring
and who relies upon her vest for ele
gance.
The stock plays an Important part,
for it matches the embroidery of the
vest. It is carried out in yellow silk,
In narrow gold braid and in a few tur
quoises, and is finished with a very nar
row gold braiding around the upper
edge and around the lower part. A
brass button finishes the little front
tabs, which are united with a white
silk loop.
You can do such a lot with the plain
est of cloth suits If only there Is an
opportunity for a vest with beautiful
decorations. Many of the handsomest
suits now come with three vests, an
embroidered chamois vest with oriental
embroidery upon its front; a white
cloth vest carried chit in gold and brass
buttons, and a vest of blue trimmed
with silver and gold.
The terms silver and gold are used
lightly in the fashion world, whereas
once they were used cautiously, be
cause they -represented the expenditure
of so much money. But such is not now
the case, and one can go as resplendent
as a glittering monarch without giving
up more than would We the price of any
baser metal.
In her visiting costume the smart wo
man who likes striking effects can go
all showy as a belted Earl. The belts
made of metal links are in again and
her waist can glitter like the sun from
the mock Jewels that are to be found in
the belt.
There are very few handsome gowns
which do not sport a little gold and sil
ver and some are largely trimmed with
it for there are silver incrustations
upon the waist and there are silvered
panels upon the skirt, all done by hand,
and made out of the finest and most
delicate, the thinnest yet the most bril
liant, of silver braid. The designs are
intricate and the pattern is fairly stiff
with silver.
Girl Who Got Jtist What She Deserved
ONCE upon a time there lived In
the town of Segreganset a
blonde. | She was slender, flex
ible, emotional and worth see
ing without a veil. Her eyes
were of an azure blue, her fingers
tapered, her instep was high and her
name was Alphoretta.
Alphoretta was as high-strung as a
concert violin and as graceful as the
weeping willow. Even when she was
all by herself she would sit on the
very edge of the chair with her skirt
wrapped under and her shoulders
thrown back Just as though it was not
the least bit painful.
There was nothing prosaic about
Miss Alphoretta. *She was a stickler
for high and lofty effects.
Every morning when the crystal
sunbeams peeped through the heavy
hangings at her window and bathed
the room in a tender, golden light, Al
phoretta would open her night-worn
eyes, desert her pillow, make a care
ful toilet and stroll into the garden,
whert she would peruse "Poems of
Passion" 'mid dew-kissed daffodils
while her mother prepared breakfast.
To the he-belles of Segreganset Al
phoretta was absolutely ungetatable.
They did not grade high enough to
segatlate in her class.
Every time one of them would take
a step in her direction she would wave
a red light. Fact is, Alphoretta's aim
waa high. She was not going to
chance herself to be* landed by any

In style, the military coats are not.
Collars are not as severe as military
collars, and the sleeves of spring are
certainly not military sleeves. On tnÂ«
contrary, they are large and loose ana
many of them are built on thÂ» gran
ny" order, which shows a very l*** 9 *
very loose sleeve, almost without
shape, yet growing steadily larger to
ward the wrist and finally ending in a
cuff at the hand. This is far remorea
from militarism, for it is purely fem

The visiting cuff Is a joy forerer. as

not at all like the stiff, long, tight entt
which formerly finished so many
sleeves.
One of the prettiest of shapes Is the
cuff, which is slashed at the baoÂ«
with the opening finished in two
rounding corners. It is a tailor made
cuff with a lingerie cuff below It.
"To make the prettiest cuff of tÂ»Â«
year, a tailor m?de cuff," says a mod
iste, "take a stiff, tight, round ouff.
about six inches deep, and fit it to the
arm. Do not have it too close and do
not slope it. Its shape must be as
straight as a linen cuff.
"Now take this cuff and slash it at
the back, cutting it almost through-
Round oft the corners, line the oufll

"Thi3 kind of a cuff is becoming to
the hand and more. It gives an op
portunity for the wearing of knife
plaited ruffles that will fall down over
the hand. These ruffles are finished
with lace or are of chiffon, big, loose.
fluffy and beautiful."
Another very pretty cuff Is Â©no
that flares. This cuff, which is almost
as deep as the elbow, is open in a
bell shape. This bell is lined with raf
fles of lace. One of these bell cuffs
was lined with ruffles of taffeta with
their edges pinked. Another waa lined
with silk ruffles, which were bordered
'wifh fringe. There are many ways
of trimming these inner linings or
cuffs.
A sleeve that is beautiful in Its sim
plicity is made in melon fashion, with
all of the melon falling below the arm.
It is stiffened and baggy in its ten
dency, instead of hanging limp. This
sleeve waa finished with a deep cuff
of lace, whi'h was transparent and
trimmed with bands of taffeta and
satin, one very glossy and the other
very dull.
Fitting the Spring Gassm
It seems almost as though thÂ«
spring gown were not to be fitted at
all. for all of its tendencies are to
ward looseness. The waists arÂ«
blousfd in the front. The skirts are
full and are cut in sweeping fashion,
and the slaves are lar~e and very
much inclined to take on melon, gran
ny, blouse and drooping shapes.
Where, then, is the fit of the gown?
To this a certain clever dressmaker
replied: "The fit of the gown, the very
test of its elegance, is found in the set
of the shoulders and in the way the
belt is managed. If the shoulders are
fitted nicely and are made to slope, if
the armholes are low and elegantly
managed, so that they do not interfere
with the low shoulder effect, and if the
yoke and stock are well fitted, the
waist is pretty sure to be elegant.
"The fit of the belt and the waist Hno
is another thing and a difficult matter
when rough materials are employed.
And with spring there will be a new lot
of rough goods, tweeds. Irish suitings
and all sorts. These, many of them,
are stretchy in their nature, and to
manage them well around the hips Is
a direct art. The canvas gowns, too.
are on the way and by spring you will
see many a canvas dress figured with
a little figure of satin.
"And. speaking of the figure of satin.
do you know that the summer silks
are nearly all to have little brocaded
figures In them, and that the summer
taffetas are positively glorious with
their little satin brocades and their lit
tle twisted silk designs?
"Particularly are the black taffetas
admirable in this respect, and for 5*
cents or so a yard one can get the
neatest little taffeta gowns. In dull
black. These have a glossy little fls^inÂ»
brocaded all through the silk, small
and fine and so arranged that almost
the whole silk is covered."
It is to be a great season for figured
goods, for the manufacturer has out
done himself this yÂ»ar, and the result
is a variety of pretty designs which
will leave even the most fastidious sat
isfied with the choice.
And there are the little -shoulder
capes of cloth and silk. "Was anything
ever prettier? These, if not detacha
ble, are laid flat and are so arranged
that they become part and parcel of
the spring suit, often ending In wldÂ«
stoles down the front, each stole end
finished with a brass button.
man who was the least commonplace.
Deep down in the labyrinths of her
mind Alphoretta had planted an idea
that some day she would be discover
ed, wooed and won by some tall man,
brave and true. He would be the
owner of vast estates, a yacht, a city
mansion and a Newport villa. He
would be a collector of priceless works
of art and n connoisseur of rare vin
tages. He would be a leader among
men and a defender of women. His
wealth would be unlimited and he
would be liberal to a fault. He would
be a Herbert Spencer in Intellect, a
James K. Hackett in form and a Harry
Lehr with the women. Hia name
would be Percival or Reginald or
Piedmont or something equally ador
able. To Alphoretta he would be con
stant and true. Her wish would be his
law and her every whim would be
gratified. He would surround her with
maids, secretaries and all that her
heart could desire in furs, frocks and
frills.
True, no man of that description
had shown a desire to accumulate Al
phoretta. But she had a hunch that
it was only a question of time when
he would appear upon the scene and
lay claim to her heart and hand. That
is why she held out on the local sud

tioned upon his filing a bond tor
$50,000 that he would comply with the
requirements of the act of Congress
concerning guano islands. Peacock, the
pirate, gave the bond and was made
ent of the Marcus Island Guano
Company. I was chosen constitutional
adviser and Secretary of War, and
Rosehill was made general manager
atd lord high admiral. We bought the
schooner Julia E. Whalen, we loaded
her with tools, provisions and supplies
and these supplies included â I blush to
say itâ a large, very large, supply of
Kentucky wines and "Blue Ribbon
PabEt." We employed a chemist and
bought an assaying outfit with which
to test the guano deposits. We gave
passage to a bugologist sent by the
Bishop Museum to explore the fauna,
flora and bird life of the island. We
shipped a double crew, so as to have
workers at the island, and learning a
few days before sailing that there were
Japanese fishermen on Marcus Island,
who were snaring and skinning our
guano birds, we equipped the lord high
edmiral with a bag of Japanese yens
which to placate them, and look
ing to the possibility of their beinj;
Implacable somebody â I always sus

The schooner sailed, leaving a hole

taken about $7000 to fill, but we were

there, as reported, we would all be
multi-millionaires.
We never learned whether the guano

th<? avowed purpose of forcibly prevent

The Cere I mon of American deporta

pressive. Nothing like it has occurred

from Nova Scotia. It needs a new
Longfellow to write a new "JEvangellne"
to depict it. In the foreground was the
wrathful Rosehill and two of his bully
eye crew. Facing him was the little
representative of the Mikado. The
lieutenantâ to his eternal credit be it
saidâ had on a pair of pantaloons, but
the sixteen marines behind him were
breechless and barefooted. Behind
'the marines were the resident fisher

lieutenant read a translation from a

hand, to where the American schooner
lay at anchor with a limp stars and
stripes drooping from her ; masthead
with the dejected droop of the tail of a
â¢ hearted dog.
"These unworthy subjects of his
mightiness the Emperor of, Japan,"
read the lieutenant, "to pursue their

United States get out of here quick.
My miserable self wonders at the good
ness of God that permits me to occupy
the same world as your Excellency, but
it makes all the same that your high
and honorable Excellency shall go
quick on board of your. worthy little
ship and sail away quick."
"Now, look here," said Rosehill, "I'm

The Marcus Island Guano Company
presented its case to the State Depart
ment in order to obtain the promise
"relief through diplomatic channels -â¢
But the Secretary of State had a gli
of islands and seemed to have no inter
est in protecting, the American acqui
sition of Marcus. It will be an act of
gracious clemency if he refrains from
suing Peacock on his bond given' to
the United States for $50,000, that he
would open the guano deposits on Mar
cus within a year.
To cap the climax Peacock, the hi
larious hotel-keeping buccaneer, was
sued by the United States and a judg
ment was rendered against him for
52000 for having, when' he registered the
Whalen. declared himself to be a United
States citizen before he was completely
naturalized. Peacock's citizenship was
for a long time a good deal like Lord
Dundreary's conundrum â "one of those
things that no fellow can find out."
He was born a blooming Britisher.
He went to Australia, then he came to
Honolulu and became a denizen but not
a citizen of Hawaii.
Under the Hawaiian constitution
denizens were accorded all the rights
of citizens, including the right to vote,
without being called upon to abjure
allegiance to their native land.
Under the act annexing Hawaii all
persons having the right of citizenship
under the republic were made citizens
of the United States.
Just here was the dilemma of luck
less Peacock. Unlike Edward Everett
Hale's "Man Without a Country," he
was a man with an assortment of coun
tries. When King Edward was crown
ed our pirate flooded his stomach with
bitter beer. The next - day he was a
dyspeptic Yankee with a nasal twang ;
and a full supply, of remorse. -
And so he alternated. On Tuesday
the hotel rates at the Moana were $4
a day. On Wednesday they were "six
teen bob."
On Tuesday, when the territorial
band played the "Star-spangled Ban
ner," our pirate arose from his seat
and waved his hat in honor of his 52000
. citizenship; of this great and glorious
republic and sang loudly:
Hall to the American eerie.
To the proud bird of freedom all hall.
The bird that -no tongue can IrtveigU
Or put salt on hit beautiful tall.
But on Fridays, when asked what
. countryman he was, he usually replied
that he , was a conglomerate combina
tion, a dod-gasted, measly Anglo-Saxon
Ornithorhyncus, an English beast with
an American billâ a bill for $2000 pre
sented by his Uncle Samuel. . And then
he would softly sing to himself, to the
tune of "Little Maud":

Stripes â¢ flying * from the summit ' of * a

cocoa palm, and when the United States
afterward accepted the acquisition by
recording: the claim in the archives of
the Department of State, just then un
der the law of nations the right of sov
ereignty of the United States over
Marcus became as vested and as per
fect as if is over the keys of Florida
or the Aleutian archipelago. Rosehill
by subsequent neglect to comply with
the act of Congress might have for
feited his own right to the guano de
posits, but he could not forfeit the
rights of his Government to the island.
When the United States accepted Rose
hill's excuses, condoned his neglect, ex
acted from him a bond of $50,000 that
in removing the guano deposits he
would comply with the act of Congress,
and issued to him papers under the
seal of the Department of State, defin
ing his rights, it assumed an obligation
to protect hlnragainst all the world in
the exercise of his rights.
"What did it do? After Rosehill sail
ed from Honolulu the Japanese Govern
ment asserted that It claimed Marcus
by right of occupancy only three years
old. Some wandering Japanese went
ashore there ten years after Rosehlll's
visit, destroyed the evidences of his
claim, occupied the shack he built, and
en-aged in killing and skinning the
birds Upon the basis of these acts
Japan annexed Marcus to the Bonin
croup, 800 miles distant, and with frigid
complacency Informed the United
States that it was about to dispatch a
war vessel to Marcus to prevent Cap
tain Rosehill from landing.
Obviously the course of our Govern
ment should have been to cable this
strutting turkey cock of the Asiatic
walk that It would order two war ves
sels to Marcus with orders to blow the .
Mikado's navy out of the water If It
attempted to interfere with Captain
Rosehill in the peaceable enjoyment of
the rights it had granted him.
But so far from taking this course,
Secretary Hay surrendered immediate- Â¦
ly, without proof and without objection,
to the demands of the Mikado's Gov
ernment, and he humbly requested the
privilege of sending by the Japanese
war vessel a note to Captain Rosehill
directing him to "get out" and leave
It to the United States to "protect his
rights by diplomacy."
And the captain "rot out" He might

have stood off the sixteen pot-bellied
Japanese marines and their thirty un
armed bird-skinning allies, for there
were fourteen men in his party, each
armed with a Mauser rine and a revol
ver, and inspired with the spirit of Pea
cock, the pirate. But he could not fight
Japan and the United States both, with
a Japanese man-of-war liable to return
any, day, so he turned the prow of the
Julia E. Whalen homeward.
We are a great nation. There is no
doubt of itâ the very greatest of the
great. From the icy mountains of the
Arctic to the coral strands of the Orient
our flag flutters and flutters and flut
ters like the splendid tail of a lonely
turkey cock strutting across an uncon
tested lawn. But when another turkey
cock jumps over the fence and contests
our right of way we say: "Why, certain
ly, my dear fellow, you are our friend;
we want no trouble with you; we will
first give you what you propose to seize
and then trust to diplomacy to deter
mine whether you had the right to take
what you have taken."

vassoâa guano island acquired exactly
as Rosehill acquired Marcus.
Andrew Johnson defied the milled
forces of France and Austria in order
to save Mexico from European absorp
tion, and It is still fresh in our memo
ries how Grover Cleveland went to the
verge Â°* * war with England in order
to protect the Monroe doctrine.
John Hay is a great statesmanâ no
doubt. It Is largely due to his splendid
diplomacy that we owe the privilege
of expending $200,000,000 per annum in
having our soldiers killed by bolomen
and bubonic plague, with not enough
returning revenue from the Philippines
to supply the army with Manila cigars.
But notwithstanding his greatness oth
erwise his action in the matter of Mar
cus Island was cowardly and evasive,
for a nation that does not protect Its
own citizens is a disgrace to the map
of the world.
CONCERNING A VOWEL
(Copyright, 1904, by M. Wood.)
R. MARK TIRRELL.
swung his ; horse Into
the bridle path that
ran along one Bide of
the avenue, and to the
(Unutterable surprise
of Nancy; who was

in the line of horseflesh, he permitted
her to drop Into the gait he was wont
to term ' ."funereal." As a general
thing when they reached* . the /. bridle
path in the gray of these early winter
mornings, Tlrrell . would say - briskly,
"Come, Nancy," Â¦ touch her with the
crop, and they would go galloping
smartly toward the reservoir in a fash
ion which made . the occupants of the
early cars turn about to catch ' another
glimpse of them. â¢'-Â¦Â¦;".â¢ -
There . was no "Come, Nancy," this
morning; no touch of the crop. Tirrell
sat stiffly in the saddle, gazing straight
aheadâ at nothing, 'apparently. So
Nancy poked along in her shuffling
walk, her head thrust out and her ears
laid back a manner which, on any
ordinary occasion," could not have failed
to rouse. TlrreH's ire. .Â¦ ;
;It was a dull, ' cheerless morning. liow
hanging clouds were ;in the sky, ; and
through i the" ; branches of the elms the
â¢wind whistled a prophecy of snow. Tlr
rell smiled grimly. - ; The i morning cor
responded admirably with " his - mood.
He , was gray and cheerless enough,
heaven knew. '/.', â¢ Â»
Â¦i- Last night, when he had quarreled
with Amy Linton, it bad seemed to him
that with very proper dignity ;he had
offered able defense of a principle ;â¢ this
morning, ,; as *he mentally reviewed ' T the
affair, he stamped his whole course \ 'of
action as asinine. - S '*-V
Miss Lin ton was not the sort of girl
who flew into temper one moment and
M

repented it the next. Her anger ma
tured slowly and was deep-rooted. Tir
rell felt sure the end had come. Xo
more jolly evenings with her before the
library flrfejsilo more rides with her in
the crisp flftr of the winter mornings.
He shut his teeth and threw back his
head.
"Close ranks here," he growled to
himself, and to the mare, "Come,
Nancy." He struck her smartly with
the crop. Nancy responded with a
sidewise spring which would have un
seated a less experienced rider, and
galloped up the path at a pace that
sent the blood surging to Tlrrell's
cheeks. But neither the pace of the
mare, nor the chill of the morninr. nor
his own determination to forget the
whole affair could drive Amy Linton
from his mind.
He could see her standing, as she
had last night, on the other side of the
library table, her face white and her
eyes flashing fire. He could hear her
say again, "There is really nothing
more to be said. Mr. Tlrrell. Good
night." and he pictured her to himself
as she swept from the room, her head
poised proudly above the perfect
shoulders.
Tirrell felt something tighten m his
throat.
"Darn it!" he exploded, and urged
the mare into a breakneck run.
Tirrell was well out toward the reser
voir, and still riding recklessly, when
he saw a riderless horse galloping
down the bridle path. He pulled Nancy
up, and heading her in the opposite di
rection, he rode slowly along, awaiting
the arrival of the other horse. As it
came up he leaned from the saddle and
grasped the bridle of the runaway.
The horse carried a side-saddle, and
there was a white star on the forehead
that brought Tirrell's heart to his
mouth. It was Miss Linton's horse.
He turned Nancy, and leading the
other horse beside him, he rode up the
bridle path arain. They had gone but
a short distance when he espied Amy
Linton walking unconcernedly down
the path. Tirrell heaved a sigh of gen
uine relief.
"I was afraid you were hurt," said
he, dismounting.
"No," she said, "I was tirateninr ths
rlrth when he left rather unceremoni
ously. Stand still. Tony, you Idiot."*
she said to the horse.
"I â I'm glad I happened along." said
Tirrell. He felt rather embarrassed.
"It was kind of you to catch him.**
she said.
Tirrell assisted her to mount.
"May I finish out the ride with you?"
he asked.
Miss Linton's eyebrows were raised â¢
trifle.
"If you wish." she said, coldly.
For awhile they galloped along in si
lence. Tirrell suddenly drew his hors*
nearer hers.
"Have you any idea where I was
headed for?" he said In a low voice.
"I'm afraid I haven't," she said.
still frigidly.
"You remember the little hill Just
past the reservoir," he pursued, "the
one where we used to ride mornings
and watch the sun sparkle the snow
on the opposite slope?"
Miss Linton regarded him steadily
for a moment.
"Yes." she said quietly.
"I was going out there," he said,
"and IâcI â cr â felt â oh, hang It: â as If
I were going to a sjrave," he blurted.
There was silence again. Then Miss
Linton spoke, her head turned from
him.
"I was going out there, too. IâlI â I
think I felt much the same."
"Amy!" he cried, and caught her
hand in his. Her head was still turn
ed from him, but the little ear nearest
him was very red.
"I am a brute," he asserted.
She laughed softly.
"You are, " she averred, "but It's
half the fight if you know it."
"I'm going to reform. " he aaid. "I
need you to help me, though. "
He felt her hand tremble in his.
"Let's ride this bridle path," he
said, "oh, say a month from now: anl
let's change it a bit. Let's make that
final 'c' in bridle' an 'a' and put it
before the T. "
She turned her head tsward him.
her face flushed scarlet.
"Let's," she said simply.

ALL SPAIN LOOKS FORWARD TO THE MARRIAGE OF KING ALFONSO
AND HIS THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD COUSIN, PRINCESS PILAR OF BAVARIA
Prospective Queen and Her
Mother Will Soon Visit
Madrid.
MADRID. Feb. Preparations are
now going forward in the Royal Palace,
in Madrid, and the best apartments are
being freshly decorated and beautified
with splendid and costly new furniture
and objects of art, for the reception of
the Infanta Dona Paz and her little
daughter Pilar. Arrangements are
being made for hunting parties and
great lawn tennis and football matches,
all with the intention of affording the
boy King, Alfonso XIII, and the little
Princess Pilar frequent opportunities
of enjoying each other's company free
from restraint.
First the Spanish newspapers, and
Immediately afterward some important
foreign journals, published the notice
that the paternal aunt of King Alfonso,
the Infanta Dona Paz, Princess of Ba
varia, would come to Madrid with her
daughter Pilar. to sojourn here for
some weeks, and that this visit is owing
to the desire .of Queen Maria Christina
to marry ,Don Alfonso to his cousin
Pilar in the foreordained event of of
ficial mutual affection uniting the
young folk.
MARRIAGE IS PLANNED.
The marriage cannot take place
before next year, but there are various
circumstances which lead to the belief
that this interesting royal wedding is
extremely likely.
Above all, it must be observed that
the official papers have published the
news. In the second place, Dona Maria
Christina Is extravagantly fond of her
sister-in-law, the Infanta Dona Paz.
Without going so far as to say that she
does not also love her other relatives,
he Infantas Isabel and Eulalia. still it
is well known that she is not satisfied
with the manners, tastes and conduct â
not always very correctâ of these dis
tinguished personages. On the other
hand, the severe Queen mother is filled
with admiration for the irreproachable
life of the Princess Paz, who, besides
being a model wife and a good woman,
has I superior education and is pas
sionately fond of that medical science
to which her Bavarian husband has
3edicated his life.
If it were not for thee, I should al
â¢nost doubt that any woman of un
blemished honor could descend from the
family of the Bourbons!" Queen Chris
tina remarked one day to Dona Paz.
evidently alluding to certain customs of
the ex-Queen Isabel II and her daugh
ers Isabel and Eulalia. Besides all this
may be added the great love which the
Queen has manifested for the three
children â two boys and one girl â of the
virtuous Infanta. She has often in
cited these youngsters to Madrid and
frequently sent them magnificent gifts.
ALIX)XSO IS PLEASED.
It also appears that this match would
?at;Efy the matrimonial aspirations of
ICing Alfonso. Indeed, with the expan
sion natural to the age and frank char
jcter of the young monarch, he has
itien observed to his most intimate
frici:ds and to his mother or.d sisters
hat he was anxious to get married as
-.on KM possible in order to se?uro an
ieir to the throne. "But the cases of
which I have read in history and the
=ad examples shown by some of the
eigning families inspire me with real
:<>rror toward matches made solely for
-tate reasons," declared Don Alfonso,
at the same time, in characteristically
formal words which have. been directly
reported to meâ "and, although I do not
like the idea cf being impelled to join
The San Francisco Call.
in marriage bonds with a girl whose
true sentiments, character and customs
are unknown to meâ because I am well
aware that we live in practical times,
and that it is an easy matter for a
maiden to feign to love a youth of my
age in order to become queen â still I
have sufficient knowledge of life not to
ipnore the fact that it is pretty difficult
to find a little princess, however aus
terely brought up, possessing that
charming purity and candor which I
desire my future wife -to have."
BHII>E A MIIRE CHILD.
The little Princess Pilar really ap
pears to deserve on account of her
physical and moral qualities the love
of Don Alfonso and the high place to
which he seems disposed to raise her.
Although she is not yet 13 years of age,
having fceen born in Munich in March,
1891, the august young lady is tall, well
formed and fully developed. With her
auburn locks, her large blue eyes, her
delicate skin and the mild expression
of her countenance, she resembles one
of the virgins painted by Murillo. Her
physical perfections are well matched
by her moral and intellectual qualities.
Pilar always accompanies her mother
in the frequent visits which the latter
makes to the hospitals and the poor of
Munich, where she usually resides, and,
like her mother, the little Princess
never tires of comforting and helping
the sick and needy. She speaks fluently
Spanish. French and English, besides
a fair sort of German, plays' admirably
on the piano and harp, and when her
studies and acts of benevolence leave
her a little time she takes her work box
and knits nice little things for the poor
children of Munich, not forgetting to
send some of the gifts from time to
time to the little ones of the beneficent
institutions of Madrid through her
"Aunt Maria Christina," who becomes
every day fonder of her, and often
calls her "su hijita del corazon" ("the
little daughter of my heart"). â¢
PtKISCK A GOOD MAX.
Of the affection which she entertains
for Don Alfonso and Spain, the eharm
ine little Princeps haÂ« recently given
eloquent proof by sending to the Inter
national Exhibition of Postcards, or
ganized here for the benefit of the poor,
a postcard on which she herself had
written the following: "My mother
tells me that by writing a few words
on this card I can contribute toward
helping some unfortunate person. With
all my heart I write: "God protect
Spain, my rea.l fatherland, and my
denre?t cousin. Alfonso XIII.' Pilar."
I have hitherto only spoken of the
mother of the little Princess without
mentioning h<"-r father. As I should not
like this silence to be interpreted un
favorably toward the latter, I hasten to
say that Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria
is a model husband, besides being an
eminent physician who attends the poor
pratuitously and has published works
highly praised in the scientific world.

QUEEN ALEXANDRA WILL NOT TOLERATE GAMBLING
AMONG WOMEN AT PLACES WHERE SHE IS VISITING
Her Majesty Is Especially Opposed to the Fashionable Game of bridge
and in This She Is Supported by the Duchess of Maryborough.
LONDON, Feb. 13.â Queen Alexan
dra has knocked the bottom clean out
of bridge playing among distinguished
social gatherings. There have been so
many card scandals in even the most
exclusive set of late that her Majesty
now refuses to countenance gambling
among women at any place she is vis
iting and she especially stipulates that
bridge must not be included in the pro
gramme, even for men. if high stakes
are likely to follow the excitement of
the game. Many great ladies are sup
porting her Majesty in her campaign,
notably the Duchess of Marlborough,
who, next to the Duchess of Devon
shire, is about the smartest player in
the high society set.
The success of the gathering which is
assembled at the Duke of Devonshire's
seat at Chatsworth this week is due to
the absence of bridge playing from the
programme. The Queen said she would
not go there, neither would many of
the ladies who sympathize with her
views, if bridge were to be indiscrimi
nately played. The turn that things
have taken is most disappointing to
the Duchess of Devonshire, who is a
devotee of bridge.
SOCIETY IS AGHAST.
Even among the Queen's friends in
the Jewish community â the Roths
childs and Sassoonsâ in which the
gambling spirit is so strong, she will
not tolerate any sort of card playing
for high stakes, and it is an open se
cret in society circles that her popular
ity among certain sections is suffering
in consequence of her determined hos
tility to all forms of indiscriminate
gambling. Princess Victoria is, like
her mother, a determined opponent of
gambling. Both are, however, expert
whist players, but only for the pur
poses of pastime.
Who will entertain the King and
Queen durinc their visit to the west
of Ireland in April? The subject is
agitating the minds of society at the
moment of writing. When the official
announcement is made I can predict
that it will be found that the Duke and
Duchess of Manchester will enjoy the
honor and that Kyiemore Castle will
be the scene of one of the most brilliant
social gatherings that nas ever been
seen in Ireland. The extensive altera
tions undertaken at the castle by the
Duchess were in anticipation of this
royal visit, and when these are com
pleted Kyiemore will be one of the most
eligible residences in the kingdom for
entertaining royalty.
Long before the Duke of Manchester
thought of acquiring the property every
effort was made to induce his Majesty
to make it a royal residence, but great
as King Edward admired its beautiful
surroundings he made no secret of the
fact that he feared to be responsible
for the heavy extra expense such an
undertaking would involve, and es
pecially at a moment when he was
forced to practice retrenchment in
other quarters. The castle has always
been one of the most expensive resi
dences in the country to maintain, and
under its altered conditions it will bÂ«
rlore expensive still.
King Edward is animated by two
motives in visiting Kyiemore. He ex
pressed an opinion once that it stood
in the midst of the finest natural
scenery in the world, and furthermore,
he is anxious to give an impetus by
his presence in the neighborhood to
the rich marble quarries in the vicinity,
which are worked by an American syn
$gesl7to2Q
dicate. The influence with the Queen
of the Duke of Manchester's American
mother doubtless has something to do
with the visit, too.
ROXBURGHE NOT RICH.
It is all nonsense to suggest that th*
Duke of Roxburgh^ has plenty r.f
money and did not need a rich Ameri
can bride, for whatever the Roxburgh**
estate may bring in, there are so man/
who have claims upon it that the
Duke's share probably does not exceed
520,000 a year. For many years Floors
Castle has been in the market to be let
"funilshed7*and for only one week in the
whole year is it usually opened. Then
a large house party is gathered and
dances given, at which the Scotch
reels, the foursomes and the eight
some are danced. During the Duke's
long minority his mother saved and
s-ved until she had over $40,000, but
most of this the Duke had spent long
since. Besides his mother and two
brothers, the Duke of Roxburghe has
four sisters, all of whom draw from
the estates.
The omission of pre-nuptial settle
ments is spoken of with dissatisfaction
as becoming a custom among American
brides. Invariably they will spends
money on their homes, which is what
they are expected to do, but the lack
of security about a regular income for
the. head of the family is disapproved
of., the case of Lord William Neville
being continually cited as a case In
point. Mr. Marietta, when marrying
his daughter to Lord "William Neville,
said he could not take money out of
his ; business for settlements, but al
lowed the young couple $30,000 a year
to live upon. Then when the Baring
crash came Mr. Murietta went bank
rupt and the William Nevilles were
left. . HSB
_ In the Official Gazette of this week
it was announced that the Duke of
Roxburghe had resigned his commis
sion as lieutenant in the Royal Horse
Guards. If a London house is to be
bought or built for the Roxburghes,
there is not the slightest doubt that it
will be paid for with the new Duchess'
money.

Druidism.
The next session of the Supreme
Grove of the United Ancient Order of
Druids will be held September next, and
the officer for promotion to the office of
supreme arch is James F. Marttnoni,
the deputy supreme arch and for a
number of years secretary of the Grand
Grove of California. Mr. Martinoni has
been a member of the order for a num
ber of years, and after filling all posi
tions in the subordinate grove of which
he is a member and in the Grand Grov*
became the noble grand arch. During
his administration the order became in
spired with new life and presented an
increase that it had not known for
many years, more than 1600 gain be
ins; made. This was the starter for
continued increase, and some of his
successors made gains during the year
of their incumbency of nearly 3000.
The Druids' Hall Association held a
meeting last week and elected new of
ficers for the term. H. Mohr, for thirty
years the president of the board, de
clined renomination. and Louis G.
Schord was elected in his stead. Charles
Quast and Henry Huffschmldt were re
elected secretary and treasurer, respec
tively. The association is now free
from debt, and during the past year
five dividends were paid. After the
meeting there was a banquet, at which
the only "outsider" was Grand Secre

Washington,WITH THE PLAYER & THE MUSIC FOLK
- It was a desultory interview. Weber
and Fields were getting ready for their
f.rst entrance when the artist and I
invaded the dressing-room, and there
after until nigh to midnight they
'.vere â¢ her hastily changing their per
bonal appearance or deliberately con
vulsing the big second-night audience,
whose laughter and plaudits came to
us in faint gusts.
"It's hard work," grasped Fields, as
he and his diminutive partner rejoined
us after having finished their initial
s-cece. The tall comedian was short of
breath, and he flung himself into a
chair and the hands of his dresser.
â¢From 7:30 p. m..till midnight we
are either toiling before the public or
s!a%'ing in seclusion." said Weber, rap
idly divesting himself of a many-but
toned bellboy jacket and tossing it to
his valet.
It seems that the older we grow the
more strenuously we have to labor."
remarked Fields, in mournful tone, as
he was being hauled and mauled into
new semblance.
"How long have you boys tfeen at
this sort of thing?" I inquired, with
due sympathy.
"Twenty-six years," was the chor
used answer. Then Weber solus:
"For twenty-six years we have been
trying to amuse the public, and our
days off have not been many."
â¢But twenty-six years ago," said
Fields, correctively, "we were not mak
ing a dozen changes of costume a
night."
"No." was the Weber retort, "our
wardrobe was too limited to allow of
more than one change. But we were
doing two dozen 'turns' a day."
"And receiving a salary of $3 each
a week," grimly chuckled Fields.
Further reminiscence was cut off by
the callboy's summons, and the fun
makers hurried away to plunge into
thoir second scene.
"If it's the story of our career you're
fishing for," said Fields when the
dresser again had hold of him, "you'll
have to take it in serial form â Con
tinued in our next, you know."
"And in short sections at that," said
Weber, passively, allowing himself to
be enveloped in a dress suit large
enough to hang loosely upon the ample
figure of "Pete" Dailey.
I consented to accept the narrative
on the installment plan, and the artist
declared he could get, along nicely by
drawing "bits."
"Well," began the heaviest half of
the firm. "Joe and I were kids, living
with our parents in {few York, when
we first came together. Clog dancing
was a favorite act on the variety stage,
and we practiced steps together until
we became quite proficient. Then we
applied to the manager of a Bowery
theater for a job. and after we had
showed him what we could do he en
gaged us to appear twenty-three times
a day. and fixed our weekly salary at
$3 apiece."
"Tell him about our song," suggested
Weber.
"Oh, yes â had to sing as well as
dance for our $3," said Fields. We
were billed as 'Weber and Fields, the
Neat Irish Team,* and our act was
opened with a song. You tell him how
the song went, Joe, while I get the
kinks out of this confounded wig."
"The song was of our joint composi
tion," said Weber, "and mighty proud
of it we were. It was â¢ entitled, 'The
Irish Lads.' and went something like
this â please note the 'ye":
Here we are, two Irish lads, :'..-â¢
As ye can plainly Gee;
For singing and for dancing
We hcpe that we please ye;
We love the place called Paddy's land,
Where jrood old times we've teen.
Our hearts were gay both night and day
In the land of the shamrock green.
"Rather neatly rhymed, wasn't it?"
grinned Fields.
"To say nothing of the sentiment,"
laughed Weber. "But you haven't
heard the chorus. Here it is:
Oh, wherever we may roam, wherever we have
been.
No place go fair
Or can compare
With the land of the shamrock green.
"Now that's what I call the limit of
song-writing license," was the com
ment of Fields, still struggling with the
obdurate wig.
"After singing the verse and chorus,"
Weber resumed, "We danced our clog
steps, and then for an encore we
tripped an Irish reel. When the man
ager demanded a change we blacked
up and sang the same song with words
to suit our color, and for another
change we sang it with a German ac
cent and again fitted the words to con
form to our assumed nationalityâsub
stituted 'Fatherland' for 'Paddy's
land.* But the .original homesick sen
timent remained, unaltered. I tell you
we worked that lyric for all it was
worth."
"And that was the beginning of our
German comedy business," put in
Fields, surveying the 'â¢ mirrored reflec
tion of his readjusted wig. "In those
days the 'Dutch* comedians wore heavy
wooden shoes and their dancing was
'more noisy than graceful. By way of
novelty we eschewed timber footwear
and indulged in 'knockabout' business.
We were the originators of . that kind
of German comedy, arrd' our act made
such a hit that we soon were able to
command a salary of $10 apiece per
week, later $15 apiece and still later $50
apiece. That was in Philadelphia, and
at the end of a year's engagement
there we began touring and stayed on
the road as members of various organ
izations until we decided to try man
agement on our own account. We were
not overburdened with money, how
ever, so to obtain the requisite cash we
jumped out here to San Francisco and
worked until we got it. That was fif
teen years ago."
Again the voice of the callboy, and
again a hasty exit of the comedians.
"So it was San Francisco that en
abled you to attain your ambition to be
managers?" was my reminder when
"the boys" returned.
"Yes," replied Fields. "With the
money earned and . saved in this ' city
we returned East and organized
'Weber and Fields' Own Company/ and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1901.
WEBER AND FIELDS TALK
OF THEIR RISE WHILE
"MAKING UP."
for seven years kept it going, with
varying success. In those days, you
must remember, there were no vaude
ville circuits, and the only good variety
entertainment the public got was from
traveling companies like ours. When
the formation of circuits began to cut
into our business we abandoned the
road and leased the theater on Broad
way which has been ours for eight
years. Our subsequent success is, I
think, pretty well known throughout
the oomntry."
"We now control two theaters in New
York and are directing three compa
nies, 'Captain Barrinfcton,' 'An English
Daisy' and our all-star stock," said
W r eber.
"Yours is a record to be proud of," I
declared with unfeigned admiration,
"and the people for whose enlighten
ment this interview is to be published
would like, I am sure, to be informed
of the secret of your steady rise from
such a humble beginning to such a
high place in the amusement world."
"I attribute our success *o hard
work," was the smaller man's modest
response.
"Yes," acquiesced Fields, "that and
a determination to give the public the
best possible value for its money, re
gardless of our own purely professional
interests."
"Which means that your hard work
has been intelligently directed," was
my comment.
"Weil, yes; you may put it in that
way," said Fields. "I believe we owe
most of our worldly possessions to the
fact that we have always surrounded
ourselves with the very best people we
could afford to engage, and have given
them free rein to display their best
abilities, regardless of whom they
might outshine."
"If there were any particular star
or stars in the cast of 'Whoop-Dee-
Doo,' for instance," Weber elucidated,
"it would not be an 'all-star' cast."
"And it would not be" so attractive,"
added Fields.
"Nor so expensive," superadded
Weber.
So that was the explanation â hard
work and self-effacement! A remark
able explanation, truly â so staggering
that for once I welcomed a recurrence
of the callboy and its resultant Weber
field absence. I wanted time for diges
tion of the Weberfleld theory.
These men, I reasoned, hare achieved
fame and acquired fortune by flying in
the face of the most cherished conven
tion of their calling. Instead of climb
ing by holding others down they as
cended by lifting others up. Now, if
that policy were generally pursued,
would !t not be better for all con
cerned? If the endeavor to win pop
ular support were unhampered by the
indirtdual self-seeking that is more
marked in the trade of acting than
in any other trade, would there not
be fewer flickering "stars" and a more
pronounced public inclination to pat
ronize the playhouses and encc-urage
the players? If this Mr. Weber and
this Mr. Fields, after acquiring stellar
distinction, had enlisted inferior art
ists to accentuate by comparison their
own superior artistry, as so many
"stars" have dune and are doing, might
not the Weber & Fields enterprises
be among the wreckage of this disas
trous season, instead of sailing: along
in high prosperity? And in view of
the proved success of the Weberfleld
plan, why is it not in greater vogue?
Why is the "single-star" system, with
ali its proven precariousness, so ob
stinately maintained while the "all
star" system is such a sure winner?
la the actor's individual self-conceit,
or fear of being outshone, forever to
stand between the manager and safe
investment and forever to deprive the
public of fair value for the money it
turns into the box office?
My reflection had reached that point
when the comedians came back, and
they smiled, but volunteer. d no en
lightenment when I repeated the ques
tions 1 had been asking myself.
"How did you happen to adopt the
'all-star' system?" I asked.
'As a novelty, I guess," was Weber's
answer. "In this business, you know,
novelty Is what we are always striving
to get."
"And maybe," said Fields, "our con
stant striving for novelty has been
among the causes of the success that
brought such a pretty compliment from
you. We were very young in the busi
ness when it became apparent to us
that ingenuity was a requisite to ad
vancement, and our minds were con
stantly at work in an inventive way.
That is how we come to shun the
wooden shoes, to introduce the "knock
about" act, to originate the dress suit
to do most of the things that have be
come identified with Weber & Fields,
including, I suppose, the 'all-star' sys
tem."
"But adoption of the 'all-star' system
meant paying salaries to people who
might supplant you in the favor of
your audiences?"
"Well, we had to take that chance."
said Weber, smiling. "But one of the
queer features of the 'all-star' system
is that it actually crushes out interne
cine jealousy while It promotes indi
vidual effort to excel. That sounds
funny, but it is true. No company was
ever less burdened with Jealousies than
is ours. Our people, principals and
chorus, were known to fame before
they joined us. Indeed their fame was
the only recommendation we considered
when engaging them. Well, they had
outgrown the little fears and spites that
afllict the novice, and they understood
that so long as they 'made good' with
us artistically no 'knocking' could in
jure them, for we strictly prohibit that
sort of thing. So a spirit of mutual
help has been developed that must be
apparent lo the people who see us
work. Every one is helping every one
else. If a line does not provoke a laugh
when uttered by one character it is
tried next night by another, and some
times it goes almost the entire round
before the desired effect is obtained.
That is one advantage of having a lot
of people who are sure of their respect
ive positions."
"There is another phase of the mu
tual-help policy that makes it really
less self-sacrificing than you may im
agine it to be," said Fields, who evi
dently had been thinking as he worked.
"If any member of the company makes
a particular hit it is to the benefit of all
in what you might term a commercial
way, for it strengthens the piece, en
hances its attractiveness, prolongs its
run and extends the engagement of
every one in the cast. Therefore it is
logical that every one should be grat
ified when an individual hit is made."
"Then, why are so many companies
ripped up by internal dissension born of
envy when cne member finds more pub
lic favor than another?" I ingenuously
inquired.
"Because the members you speak of
are young persons, as a rule," replied
Weber. "When they arrive at the age
of discretionâ and I acknowledge that
in this business it takes some people a
long time to get thereâ they will realize
that individual ambition must not be
permitted to gallop at will, else it is,
sure to bring its owner to grief. They
will have arrived at the conclusion,
also, that the goal they are aiming at
is easier to reach through winning the
good will of their coworkers than by
provoking and defying enmity. They
will appreciate the value of the golden
rule."
"This profession of ours," said Fields,
"is exceptional in its exaction of tact.
In mercantile life the hired man or
woman has only the employer to please
and look to for advancement, while the
actor or actress can only get merited
promotion by winning the favor of the
public as well as of the employerâ the
manager. A level head is required to
capture and hold the good graces of
both manager and public, and heads
are usually leveled by experience. That
is why so many young stagefolk make
fools of themselves. Unless the begin
ner has transcendental genius or phe
nomenal wisdom he finds the first half
dozen years prolific of unpleasantness,
largely of his own making. The longer
one remains in the business the easier
one is to get along with, whether that
one has moved ahead or stood still."
"You don't mean to say that 'profes
sional jealousy' wanes as the years
wax?" I protested.
"It would wane if the years brought
discretion." said Weber, "but I have
told you that in this business it takes
some people a long time to arrive at the
age of discretion."
"Am I to infer from what you have
told me that the Weber & Fields All
star Company is an organization of
veterans?"
"Every man of them," replied Weber.
"And what of the women?"
"I have arrived at the age of discre
tion," was the answer of Weber, deliv
ered deliberately and with coldness.
"Me, too," was the utterly uninvited
confession hastily subscribed by Fields.
The artist fidgeted.

The general drift of talk seems to be
that next season will be one of Shake

The latest report has it that the suc

had much to do with Lillian Russell
deciding to return to the field of comic
opera next season. The present indica
tions are that the fair Lillian will have
a new opera of the romantic sort writ

when she goes a starring again it will
be under her own management. Th*
fair Lillian retired from the comic opera
field just when musical comedy was
coming into vogue. It looks now as if
that form of entertainment has played
out the string for tne time being, and
that the public is once more turning
back toward the romi- opera pieces in
which the ability of the prima donna to

gument he again grew heated in his
remarks, and again the colored man
quietly and mysteriously entered, and,
clearing his voice, declared:
"If you were the devil himself, dr>
you think you could make me like
you ?"
To Sothern'sV f\:e3t's surprise tha
ictor took the interruption as a mat
ter of course, so Sothern's visitor in n
dazed manner continued his argu
ment, only to be interrupted by the
colored intruder, this time with
the remark:
"I knr>w you now, and God knows
I pity you."
Mr. Sothern's guest was now too
surprised to talk. He sat in a col
lapsed condition until the same man
had entered three separate times and
in expressionless voice had said:
"I am as changeless as the sun. I
will carry my soul pure to heaven.
"You are the strange woman.
"You shall be as beautiful as I
and as happy."
The last remark was too much evn
for Sothern's friend's nerves. He was
barely able to gasp, "Sothern, what
the does this mean? Is this Â«.
j*ke or an insane asylum? Who is
this fellow?"
"That," said the actor, "that is sim
ply my dresser, Lewis. His duty is to
notify me of the progress of the play
by lines. In tha f . manner I know
when my cue comes."
"Oh." said Mr. Sotherns guest, wip

the finishing touches to his new

What a jolt the sudden wedding ol
Miss Shortridge and Emil Bruguiere
gave to society. Ever since October last
the nuptials have been looked for:
then came Mr. Bruguiere's trip East
in the interest of his opera. "The
Three Kinsrs of Korea," and coinci
dent with it the report of the break
ing of the engagement of the young
folk.
So soon, however, as the opera had
a hearing â and incidentally was ac
cepted â the young composer returned
to Monterey, where Miss Short ridge
was visiting with her mother. If any
cloud had darkened their love it was
not made manifest in their attitude
toward each other.
Much time was spent at Pine Inn.
at Carmel-by-the-Sea, and daily can
ters were taken over the hills and dales
âbut no dressmakers, no florists, no ca
terers hovered near, so even the keÂ«*n
scentpd tabbies never dreamed of the
event being sprung upon them in such
an unorthodox manner.
A Justice of the Peace, a little Mon
terey hotel parlor, to which any
neighboring farmer might brine his
wild rose to be wedded, and a dearth
of attendants save the bride's father,
Charles M. Short | stamped the
wedding with the Indelible marks of
distinction.

a â little â â bit asea on a few little

For the easily shocked girl: "Don't

foolish are always deadly dull."
For the silly girl: "Don't chatter.
(This. I think, especially applies to
topics at teas.) Gigglers should be
punished by solitary confinement."
For the romantic girl: "Don't ratify
the heresy that girls 'love darkness
better than light.* Light up. or you'll
hear the hissing of the scandal snake. "
To every girl: "Don't speak ill of
your ex-friends. Ignoring them is bet
ter."
To the insincere girl: "Don't be *
shallow pate. Be bright, merry and
witty, but never frisky or frivolous."
To some girls I know: "Don't use the
name of a wealthy acquaintance in or
der-to exalt yourself. You Immediate
ly drop, in the opinion of listeners, t'j
the vulgarian's status."
'.'. To us all: "Don't talk loudly in a

bad manners and lack of arti.
taste." But * how about church?
Haven't you seen some antic at wed

especially apropos at this busy hour:
"Don't abuse your strength. Youn^

DIPLOMACY OF HAY
SCORES A TRIUMPH
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â
Secretary Hay has added an
other to his long list of diplo
matic triumphs, and the United
States is once more by his dip
lomacy enabled to lead the na
tions in an effort to preserve the
integrity of China.
Hay's note of February 10 to
Russia and Japan, asking them to
confine hostilities within as small
an area as possible and to re
spect the neutrality and adminis
trative enttty of China. *vt!l be ac
cepted by Russia, as well as by
Japan, and all the nations Avill
join the Washington Govern
ment in inviting the combatants
i to agree to the proposition.
Jusseran<l, the French Embas
sador. called upon Secretary Hay
at his residence to-day to
inform- him officially of
I France's acceptance, and in
! ferentially it is known that Rus
| sia's acquiescence will be com
municated very soon. At the
Ru-sian embassy to-night no in
formation had been received of
the Government's probable an
swer to Secretary Hay's note, but
Â¦ Consul Cassini, the Russian Em
bassador, will inform Secretary
Hay ns soon as St. Pc Â°rsburg
i advises him.
Acceptance by the powers of
tlie^ Washington Government's
suggestion will be followed by a
further exchange of views as to
the practicability of the sugges
tion, to the principle of which all
have given their adherence. As
the note is crt the, most general
character it will be necessary to
discuss at some length the possi
bilities it contains. It is generally
understood that hostilities will be
confined, so far as China is con
cerned, to Manchuria, Shanhaik
vait probably marking the western
boundary of the theater of action.
No 'official definition has yet
been given to the term "adminis
trative entity."' It is not ex
pected that a treaty will be neces
sary to execute Secretary Hay's
proposition, but that an exchange
of notes will suffice.
Russia's decision to acquiesce
was readied only after consulta
tion with several European pow
ers. It is understood that â Del
casse brought strong pressure to
bear in St. Petersburg in support
and that Embassador Porter in
Paris was most active in obtain
ing France's approval.

Gentlemen: â About two years ago
this extremely robust body of mine i
showed signs that something was '
wrong with it. My usual vigor gave j
place to a feeling of lassitude. I
was annoyed by frequent headaches. Â¦,
occasional" spells of dizziness, and in- j
w" -^Fi^^^- â¢ Â¦ Â¦ -^ â "^ v
stead of my usual good appetite could
hardly force myseli to eat a meal.
Two physicians whom I consulted
said I had malaria, but their pre-
scriptions did me no good. A third
one whom I -consulted told me my
kidneys were out of order and advised
me to take Swamp-Root. â¢
I got half a dozen bottles and could
feel the benefit before I had finished
the first one. By the time I had
taken six bottles I felt I was cured.
â¢My appetite had come back, the
headache had disappeared, and I felt
as fit as the day I met Sullivan at
New Orleans. As a pleasant and
speedy remedy and a sure strength
builder, it gives me pleasure to !
recommend Swamp-Root' to all my j
friends. Very truly,

livered to the provisional junta for
ratification. It will probably be rat
ified on Monday.
Dr. Amador, who will be elected

The article which authorizes the
United States to restore order in the
republic of Panama, should order be
disturbed, has been retained in the
constitution.
Pablo Arosemona has been made
president of the Constitutional Con
vention and Aristides Arjona and Cirio

WASHINGTON. Feb. 13. â Consul
Malmrose, at Colon, cables the State
Department to-day that Mr. Russell,
who is going to Panama to take
charg-e of the American legation, has
just arrived at Colon and reports all
quiet at Cartagena. It is said that no
determination has yet been reached to
appoint a minister to succeed Mr.
Buchanan. If such an appointment
is made it probably will go to Mr. Rus

made a member of a permanent com

of the probabilities of the continuance
of pension legislation growing out of

RUSSIA IS STIRRED TO BITTER RESENTMENT
AGAIN ST THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
THE CALL'S SUMMARY OF EVENTS IN THE FAR EAST WAR
From St. Petersburg muler this morning's date came a report of the receipt of an official telegram
from Port Arthur, which said the lights of Japanese ships were seen off Kluchau on Thursday, and adding
that it was probable a big sea light was in progress off Wiju, the booming of heavy cannon having been dis
tinctly heard after six Japanese battleships had appeared off Tatungkong, on the estuary of the Yalu.
Japanese advices received in London gave the somewhat startling report that three of the giant cruis
ers of the Vladivostok fleet had been torpedoed near Hakodate in the Straits of Tsugaro, but small credence
was placed in tiie story even by the Japanese in London.
Russia and France have decided to accept the American note on China, but it was added that this ac
tion had been forced upon Russia, the feeling in St. Petersburg being that America, in connection with Its
action in this regard, had shown that it was distinctly and aggressively pro-Japanese in the present crisis.
The Chinese Government has issued a proclamation of neutrality and will endeavor to protect for
eigners In China during the war.
Russia has been asked by the American State Department to explain the detention of the American
vessel Pleiades in the harbor at Port Arthur.
Russia's summoning of the entire Siberian reserve force to the colors will add 300,000 men to the
army of Admiral Alexieff.
It is reported that a Russian fleet of seven war vessels ha 9 appeared in Philippine waters.
France lias decided not to issue a proclamation of neutrality at present.

understood, will not be inclined to
inquire further into the details of
the proposition. The formal ac
ceptance of the other powers, it is
expected, will follow rapidly, but
the success of the proposition is
assured by the decision of Russia
and Japan to agree to it.
JAPAN'S ATTITUDE
TOWARD NEUTRALITY
OF CHINESE EMPIRE
PARIS, Feb. 13.â The Japanese lega
tion here to-day gave out the text of a
lengthy cable message from Tokio de
fining Japan's attitude toward the
neutrality of China. It says China
should observe strict neutrality and
lays down the following principles:
"Firstâ The belligerents are morally
bound to reduce to a minimum the
area of war. To this end the war op
erations should be geographically lim
ited.
"Second â The number of belligerent
powers should be reduced as much as
possible and the war should be con
fined to Japan and Russia in order to
prevent a general conflagration.
"Thirdâ lt Is of the utmost Impor
tance that order be preserved
throughout the interior of China and
at the treaty ports. Therefore, Japan
has instructed her Minister at Peking
to urge upon Prince Ching that China
scrupulously observe neutrality, main
tain order and refrain from furnishing
supplt'fs to the; â¢ belligerents. China
should also keep sufficient garrisons
at Shanhaikwan and other strategic
points to prevent a breach of "neutral
ity and see that all territory except
Mnnrhuria is free from war opera
tions.
"Under the foregoing conditions,
Japan will respect China's neutrality."

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 13. â I
have taken pains to find out the actual
sentiment in Government circles here
concerning the United States. It is
that with much regTet Russia is bound
to acknowledge that the American
administration is distinctly â even ag
gressivelyâanti-Russian and pro-
Japanese. This more than ever was
clearly shown in the latest action of
Secretary Hay taking the lead in an
understanding with Japan to force
this country into admitting the integ
rity of the Chinese empire, including
Manchuria, as part of that empire.
This, Manchuria being Russia's bat
tleground, she can not admit on any

account. A high official, speaking on
the subject, said:
"If countries learn to know their
friends in times of complications such
as we are now passing through,
America has singled herself out as our
strongest antagonist in backing up the
Japanese. We quite believe the re
port that the United States has fur
nished our enemies with a loan."
On the subject of the attacks of the
Novoe Vremya against the United
States, which excited so much ire there,
I am requested from an official source
to correct the evident misapprehension
in America as to the official importance
of the editorials published here. While
all political telegrams are carefully re
vised, the same does not apply to edi
torials. Those the editors write as they
please.
The Novoe Vremya's editorials mere
ly reflect the popular bitterness in Rus
sia against the action of the United
States, which is apparent to every one.
Indeed, so fully is that feeling appre
ciated that the authorities here have
taken special precautions to prevent
crowds of demonstrators who are
parading the city from going near the
United States embassy, lest they should
do harm there.
The Finance Ministry, in denying
to-day the report that Russia has pro
hibited the exportation of grain,
added that no such step was ever con
templated.

defining what is meant by contraband

only articles having a belligerent destination,
as to an enemy's port or fleet. With this ex
planation the .. following articles are. ,â¢; for the

Chamberlain at Work.
Apart from his occasional attention
to gardening, Mr. Chamberlain is
probably as busy when at Highbury
as during his heaviest official work.
His correspondence and public duties
have rather increased than otherwise
with his relinquishment of official life.
Two hundred letters, on an average,
are received by him each day. All are
read and answered personally, with
the aid of a private secretary and com
petent shorthand writers. This cor
respondence has to be dealt with most
carefully, for artful opponents are for
ever laying cunning traps for the
Birmingham statesman, and too faith
ful friends are but little less trouble
some with their suggestions and
conundrums.
The house is beset with newspaper
correspondents, with whom Mr. Cham
berlain is always popular. He talks
freely with them and fully appreciates
the power and influence of the press;
yet no correspondent has ever ex
tracted a secret from him. He works
far into the night, parliamentary life
having accustomed him to late hours.
Three in the morning often finds him
still at his desk. His speeches are
carefully prepared and are privately
declaimed to his secretary the day be

i satisfaction in Great Britain,
but the extent of popular ju
! bilation finds no expression in
j the London press, which is care
| ful not to offend Russia.
From the point of view of the man
! in the street Great Britain's Far East
| crn ally had exceeded all expectations,
and even the naval and military offl
i cers who prophesied Initial successes
j for Japan are surprised. The total or
i partial disablement of nine Russian
! war vessels in the opening week of the
' struggle is generally considered by ex
: perts here as giving Janan control of
j the Far Eastern seas. Lord Salisbury^
; much-criticized treaty with the rising
I power in the Orient now stands among
the most popular steps undertaken by
I any British statesman.
Countless deductions, both military
and naval, are drawn publicly and
privately from the dramatic events
j which have occurred since Monday,
| and all the inherent naval interest
Â¦ pervading the United Kingdom has
I been stirred to its depths by the duel
| between Viceroy Alexieff and Admiral
I Togo. If the British themselves had
been involved in the movements of the
opposing fleets they could scarcely
have followed them with keener zest.
What strikes those responsible for
the naval policy of Great Britain as
most remarkable is the extraordinary
disproportion between the loss infiict
| ed and the loss sustained by Japan.
j The immunity of the fleets of the
I United States at Manila and Santiago
| astounded the naval authorities here,
! and now when Japan, to all intents,
I gains control of the sea without the !
loss of a single war vessel and with
only four men killed, hish naval and
military officers in London openly con
j fess that they are amazed.
Putting Japan's experience during
the past week side by side with the
results of American engagements
against the Spanish navy, the authori
ties here have come to the important
conclusion .that the efficiency of the
navy personnel possesses an infinitely
I greater value than has ever been at- '
tributed to it.
Coal for 371 Years.
Such is the question discussed in i
the London Engineering Magazine for ;
December. It appears that there is
coal in the United Kingdom to a depth
of 4000 feet, sufficient, at about the >
present rate of output, to suffice for
371 years, but that this period will be I
considerably extended, seeing that .
there is every probability that mining
can be carried on to a depth of 7000
feet, though at this depth therÂ» will
not be anything like the area of coal ;
that there is at the former limit. It is :
also reasonable to "expect that this j
period of supply may be still further
extended by a more economical use of
fuel, due to the establishment of cen
tral electrical supply stations and the
utilization of Mond and other gas pro
ducing processes and of gas driven en
gines, as well as other means of ob

THE IMPORTANCE OF JAPANESE VICTORY AT PORT ARTHUR
Germany fears Japanese Victory Would Mean
the Exclusion of the White Race From Asia.
BERLIN, Feb. IS. â The position of
the German Government respecting
ths Russo-Japanese war is well de-
Sr.cd. It is exact neutrality in act, but
in sentiment it is sympathetic toward
Russian predominance in China -rather
than Japanese predominance there.
The common talk in Ministerial
quarters is that this is not a simple
contest for territory in Korea or Man
churia, but rather a combat of civili
zation and of race ideals, and If one
must chooee between the white and
the yellow Germany stands by the
tvliite.
The Government here is conscious
that Russia has not acted wisely and
that Japan has sufficient reasons for
making a:, and especially that after
tlie Chino- Japanese war Japan was ad
vised to give up Port Arthur and that
Russia took possession of this place.
Germany recognizes, also, that other
powers have cause for complaint in
That Russia did not keep her promise
to evacuate Manchuria and that
smong these powers is Germany,
which holds opinions identical with
those of the United States concerning
the open door. The Foreign Office has
this week expressed this view to the
State Department in "Washington.
FEARS JAPAN'S POWER.
But beyond these considerations there
are. according to a very high German
official, greater considerations of states
manship which prompt Germany to
withhold sympathy from Japan and to
hope that Russia will not be van
quished.
Japanese victory is believed by this
official to mean that Japanese influence
will be supreme in China, and that the
cry would go u^, "Asia for the
Asiatics." He believes also that, terri
torially and economically. Great Brit
ain, Germany and the United States
would in the event of Japan's winning
bo expelled from the East. In Germany
there is foreseen this state of affairs
when Japan shall have trained several
million Chinese as soldiers and sailors
and Inspired them as Gordon's "ever
victorious" army was inspired by sue- (
ceseful and thoughtful leadership.
AGAIXST THE "YELLOW PERU .
The "yellow peril"' is a conviction in
Germany and Germans readily accept
the view of Russia that to give Japan
equal rights to enter and settle Man
t huria and to cross the 3000 miles of
frontier separating- China from Rus
sia might turn Western civilization
back upon the Ural Mountains. The l

THE SAX FRANXISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14. 1904.
Belief That the Mikado Will Encounter Great
Difficulty in Landing Big Force in Korea.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â Now that of
ficial reports show that fewer Russian
ships at Port Arthur have been put out
of commission than was believed on the
day after the torpedo attack and the
fleet fight, naval and military experts
in making their estimates of the im
portance of these engagements are no
longer irlclined to say that Japan has
control of the sea. Because of the dan
ger and difficulty of sending a military
expedition even into Korea w-hile so
many Russian ships are in Eastern
waters it is doubted here if Japan
would be able to inaugurate any land
fighting before there Is another big
naval engagement.
The powerful Russian cruiser squad
ron which has left Vladivostok prob
ably will successfully combat anj*
smaller Japanese fleet. That Japan
would attempt to land a large army at
Port Arthur, or near there, is consid
ered highly improbable by officers of
the War Department.
JAPAN FACES DIFFICULTIES.
A high officer of the navy, skilled in
naval strategy, said to The Call corre
spondent to-night that it would be a
foolish effort at tins time. Although
the Japanese might have the Port Ar
thur branch of the Siberian railway be
hind them as they advanced northward
into Manchuria in an effort to attack
the Russian force on the Yalu from the
rear, it would not be possible to con
duct effective operations with much
less than 100.000 troops. To put this
immense force over the sea from Naga
saki or Sasebo would require at least
100 transports, each carrying at least
1000 men. lo put such a force across
the Straits of Korea to Fusan or Ma
sampho or to send it to Chemulpo
would be a sufficiently hazardous un
dertaking with the cruiser squadron
from Vladivostok hovering to the
northward .
"To send an army to Port Arthur
would be far more difficult," said the
naval expert. "Troopships are hard to
convoy. One hundred of them would
make a very long string and would
require almost as strong a force as
Japan \h now holding at Port Arthur.
The convoy of the fleet must be -large
enough to successfully repel an attack
ing fleet and at the same time defend
the troopships from attack by torpedo
craft and small gunboats, one , shot
from ' which would sink an ordinary
transport.
DANGER TO TRANSPORTS.
"The Russians undoubted!" would be
willing to lose a battleship or a swift
cruiser if by making a dash at a well
defended military expedition on the
sea it could, before bein^r sunk, get
into the transport fleet and sink a half
dozen or more ships. A Russian fight
ing ship, if it could get past the first
line of defense of the transports, equld
ram, torpedo and work all its guns
with fatal effect before going to the
bottom itself. A six-inch shell through
a transport would send it and its hu
man cargo to the bottom.
"If the main squadron off Port Ar
thur were withdrawn to convoy trans
ports either to Korea or Manchuria,
the Russian fleet undoubtedly* would
come out and wait for it, or intercept
it at an advantageous moment. Japan
cannot weaken her force at Port Ar
thur to any marked extent to provide
convoy for military expeditions else
where. If she should, the Russian
fleet probably would be able to give
the Japanese a hard battle on the open
sea."
STATE DEPARTMENT
EXPLAINS THE SCOPE
OF HAY'S PROPOSAL
Â¦WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â The State
Department to-day issued this state
ment:
"After some preliminary exchange
of views between this Government and
the governments of other powers in
terested in Chinese matters, the de
partment on the 10th of February sent
the following instructions to the
American representatives in St. Peters
burg, Tokio and Peking:
" 'You Will express to the Minister
of Foreign Affairs the earnest desire
of the Government of the United States
that in the course of the military
operations which have begun between
Russia and Japan the neutrality of
China, and, in all practicable ways,
her administrative entity, shall be re
spected by both parties^ and that the
area of hostilities shall be localized
ar.d minimized as much as possible, BO
that undue excitement of the Chinese
people may be prevented and the least
possible less to the commerce and in
tercourse of the world will be occa
sioned. JOHN HAY.'
"At the same time this Government
informed all the powers signatories of
the protocol at Peking ofNts action and
requested similar action on their part.
"No answer to the above note in
addition to those received up to
yesterday had been received at
the State Department. There is a hint
All You Need To Do
Simply sign the above â that is all. Ask for the
book you need. The offer I make is broad is
liberal. The way is easy â is simple. The Re-
storative is certain.
But do not misunderstand me.
This is not a free treatment, with nothing
ever to pay. Such an offer would be misleading
â woi-ld belittle the physician who made it. But
I believe In ;i sick one's honesty â his grati-
tude. That when he is cured he will pay the
cost or the treatment â and gladly.
I msKc this offer so that those who might
doubt may learn at my risk.
Tr-H of it. please, to a friend who is sick. Or
send me his name. That's but a trifle to as';c
a minute's time^ â a postal. He is yÂ«ur friend.
You can help him. My way may be his only
way tw get well.
I, a stranger, offer to do all this. Wont you,
his lriend, his neighbor, simply write?
He will iearn from my l>ook a way to get
well. Perhaps, as I say, the only way for
him. His case may be serious â hopeless <al-
most. Other physiciansâ other specialists may
have failed. The mutter is urgent, then. '
Write me a postal or sign above to-day.

that Austria "will seek to avoid any
participation in the proposed repre
sentation to the belligerents on the
ground that she has small concern in
the matter, but no formal answer has
been Jr^ceived from her.
"England wants a more definite state
ment of the purpose and scope of the
note. Secretary Hay is disinclined to
yield to this wish. He thinks that it
would be impossible to get the powers
together if any attempt were made to
very exactly define the purpose of con
current action. As to Manchuria, the
question is left open purposely as to
whether or not China's administration
is or is not in force in that war-swept
territory. That is why the term "admin
istrative entity' was used in Secretary
Hay's note. It is a question of fact, to
be determined later on, whether or not
China does possess administrative en
tity in Manchuria.
"The suspicion engendered by the is
sue of the note is inexplicable to the
authorities here. It is declared that the
Government has been anjmated by the
most simple and direct purposes, and
has tried to express that fact in its
note.
"There is great danger of the flight
from Peking of the Chinese court if it
is not speedily proved that there is no
danger of any invasion of China by
one or ttie other of the belligerents.
The State Department has been warned
by China itself that the Chinese court's
flight would lead to a general rising
against foreigners that might result in
ma&sacres. And the end would be per
haps the disruption of China. In this
event, it is believed here, the neutral
powers would make off with the lion's
share, the belligerents being too much
occupied to prevent then. This convic
tion on the part of the officials here
causes them to freely express the opin
ion that Russia will be guilty of a
grave mistake if she reject Secretary
Hay's proposals. But if she does do so,
it is said, there will be no attempt
made on our part to secure through
force of arms the purposes stat>d in
the note. In other words, the United
States is not to be dragged into hos
tilities in the Far East."

The Minister had no news touching

AJfEBICA DEMANDS
AN EXPLANATION OF
KISSIAN GOVERNMENT
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13. â The
State Department has instructed Em
bassador McCormicU to ask the Rus
sian Government at St. Petersburg for
an explanation of the compulsory de
tention in the harbor of Port Arthur
of the American steamship Pleiades,
which conveyed a cargo of flour to
that place from Honolulu before the
outbreak of hostilities. The ship is
owned by the Boston Towboat Com
pany, vvhich has made formal com
plaint to the State Department, hence
the instructions to Minister McCor
miek.
By some of the officials here the
opinion is expressed that the detain
ing of the ship is not in violation of
international law. provide adequate
demurrage is paid to the owners of
the vessel. It is assumed that the
vessel is detained for strategical pur
poses and naval officers point out that
her departure at this time might ena
ble the Japanese to learn important
facts about the condition of aaffirs at
Port Arthur. It is roughly estimated
th.ir ample demurrage would be from
$100 to $-00 per da3\ depending upon
the value of the vessel's return cargo.
LONDOX, Fob. 13. â The owners of
the British steamer Foxton Hall
(from Barry December 11. via Port
Said, Cor Port Arthur), coal laden,
have been advised that the vessel has
been detained by the Russian authori
ties at Port Arthur. Russian soldiers
have been placed on board the vessel
and her British captain and crew have

"William Torst Has System of
Field Telegraphy He Wishes
to Sell Japanese Government
GOING TO THAT COUNTRY
j,y.>>%.-vÂ«- :v -'. Â«Â« â ~â . - . -
?<;ni Pedro Inventor Says 'Com
Â¦>; munication . Can Be Carried
" : on During: Heavy Battle Din
Â¦ William Torst of San Pablo. Cal.,
claims to have perfected a system. .of_
wireless field communication that bids
fair to be an important 'facior. in mod
ern warfare. From experiments, re
cently made he, says he can so arrange
his apparatus as to insure direct com
munication between any number of
movable objects miles apart amid the i
roming ot heavy guns and in the:
midst of the thickest fighting. '
Torst is an electrical genius. For
years he has been experimenting with
wireless telegraphy, and although
working with small and inexpensive
Â¦atus. has achieved many won
derful results. A slinky fishing pole
elevated thirty feet .above his .San
Pablo residence, together with two o?
three, loose wires and a meager .qp.il.
constitute about all of the material
this young genius has to work with.
But despite this fact Torst is develop
ing new ideas and has equipped a sta
tion that surpasses anything of the
kind now in operation on the coast so
far as results are concerned.
Torst is preparing to go to Japan
with his system of wireless field com
munication now that war has been de
clared between that country and Rus
sia. His scheme is being: financed by
several wealthy men in the southland, j
who are ready to push it with their i
money.
The attention of the public was first
directed to young Torst when he dis
closed his ideas on the "Hertzian.
Wave," a factor in wireless telegraphy
that hap . long puzzled the minds Of* Â¦
the world's greatest scientists. So
convincing was his argument in re
gard to the location of this wave that
many prominent electricians offered
his assistance.
In giving his views on this question, !
Torst said:
"Since making an experiment some
weeks ago, 1 have come to the conclu
sion that the so-called 'Hertzian Wave'
is nothing more or loss than radiative
energy. It is a relative principle that
permeates space from any parallel ob
ject, be it vertical or horizontal, and
is charged with static, or high voltage
electricity, the degree of intensity de- ]
pending entirely upon the force of the
current and the insulating capacity of
the conducting medium."
Torpt is a native of Wyoming, but i
has lived in California for twenty
ftmrm. It if said he gave evidence ot
marked ability as a student of elec
tridty at an early age. His invention i
of an instrument to W used in separ
ating conversations over a party line
on the telephone, ; several years ago,
.showed much skill, and the young j
electrician was the recipient of many ;
"flattering offers from a score of rich;
people in Los Angeles and different
parts of the East.
Jlajftilrc Is Not Insane.
Tie attorney for Frank Maguire,
v.lio is waiting trial in Judge Cook's
court on a charge of erand larceny,
having made a plea that Maguire was
insane, a jury was impaneled last
Tuesday to hear the testimony. It
was decided, however, to send Maguire
to the insane ward In the Central
Emergency Hospital for . observation.
Yesterday morning the jury heard the
evidence of Drs. Lustis and Wads
worth and brought in a verdict that
Maguire was sane. His trial was set
for February 26. He is accused . of

LOSS OF FOUR TORPEDO
BOATS IS DENIED BY
TOKIO GOVERNMENT
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13. â The Jap
anese Minister to-night received a ca
blegram from his Government official
ly denying the report that four Jap
anese torpedo-boats had been sunk in
the Port Arthur attack. The cable
gram added that, although the Jap
anese ships had incurred damage,
none was sunk or disabled.
It is believed the Japanese fleet has
gone, to Sasebo for repairs.
Japanese officials here show little
corfcern over reports that the Vladi
vostok cruiser squadron would harass
the coast of Northern Japan. It is
said that Kure and Hakodate are am
ply fortified.
The entire tejft of the President's
neutrality proclamation was cabled
to-day to the- Philippines for promul
gation there. This was done at great
expense, for the reason that the Phil
ippines would be the most likely scene
of breaches of neutrality owing to
their contiguity to the scene of war.
It was decided by the executive
committee of the American National
Red Cross Society to-day to authorize
those who applied to engage in Red
Cross work in the Russo-Japanese
war to effect such organization for the
purpose as may be practicable" with
the sanction of the committee and
such support as might be available/
Among those who have made applica
tion are two prominent medical men.
MICHAEL DAVITT SAYS
POPULACE OF IRELAND
FAVORS THE RUSSIANS
NEW YORK, Feb. 13.â Michael
Davltt, Irish leader and former member
of Parliament, arrived yesterday on
the steamship Celtic of the White Star
! line. Davitt scouted the idea of Eng
j.lanfl and France being drawn into the
j struggle between Japan and Russia
1 and deplored any attempt to influence
j public opinion in this country to take
sides against the Czar and his people
in the present conflict.
"When I left the other side," said
| Davitt, "it was fully expected that war
: would be avoided. Sober opinion every
where was that there was no need for
war and I am sure it is a matter of re
gret over there that hostilities have be
gun.
"In England the prevailing sentiment
is in favor of Japan, as can be imag
ined. Ireland is for Russia.--Natural
ly enough, you may say, because "Ire
land sometrmes disagrees with Eng
land. But justice is not with the Jap
anese side of the case."

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving: Health and lienuty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
â¢disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
! the human system for the same
i cleansing .purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
, you take of it the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply, absorbs the
gnses and Impurities always) present in
; the stomach and intestines and carries
tnem out of the syst?n-..
Charcoal sweetens the breath- after
inioking, drinking or after e.uing
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually c.ears and. im-
proves the complexion; it whitens the
, teeth and further acts as a natural
: and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels: it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in' one
form or another, but probably the
best charcoal and the most for the
money is in Stuart's Absorbent Loz-
e nges; they are composed of the finest
, powdered willow charcoal and other
, harmless antisentics in tablet form or
: rather in the form of large, pleasant
| tasting lozenges, the charcoal beine
â¢ mixed with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
i plexion, sweeter breath and purer
: blood, and the beauty of it is that no
| possible harm can result from their
I continued use, but, on the contrary,
J great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
i the benefits of charcoal says: "I ad-
Â¦ vise Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges to
Â¦ all patients suffering from gas in
i stomach and bowels and to clear the
I complexion and purify the breath,
' mouth and throat; I also believe the
I livÂ«r is greatly benefited by the daily
use of them; they cost but 25 cents a
I box at drug stores, and although in
some sense Â¦ patent preparation, yet
I believe I get mote and better char-
coal in Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges
than in any of the ordinary charcoal
1 tablets."

BLUE OFFICERS
FOR NEGLIGENCE
Marine Board of Inquiry at
Seattle â¢ Binders Decision
on the Clallam Disaster
SEATTLE, Feb. 13.â The decision of
the marine board of inquiry which sat
i upon the Clallam disaster case, 'handed
' down to-day, lays the chief b^ame for
j the disaster upon Chief Engineer de
j Launey, charging him with neglect and
i incompetehcy.
Captain Roberts is censured for not
' having an officer of the ship in the sec-.
I ond and third boats that were launched
j and for not giving explicit orders to the
j captain of the Holyoke to takft the ship
to the nearest shelter.
The officers of the tugboats Holyoke
and Sea IÂ»ion are highly complimented
for their share in the work of rescuing
the passengers of the Clallam.
De Launey's license is revoked and
! the license of Captain Roberts is sus
j pended for one year. â¢
Referring to the" cause of the wreck
I the decision says:
"We find that the Clallam was well
and properly equipped with pumps of
! the best construction, bilge strainers
and suction pipes, properly and conve
niently placed. The amount of water
whirh entered and sank the ship and
. the time consumed in doing so justifies
the conclusion, and all the evidence
tends to Bhow and results prove, that
said pumps were not handled in an ef
ficient manner, and .ive find that the
primary cause which led to the sinking
of the Clallam was neglect on the part
of the chief engineerâ neglect in not at
tending to and keeping the bilge under
control, neglect in not notifying tne
captain immediately that the water in
the bilge was beyond control, and in
competency in not improvising means
to keep the pumps in operation."

WAR VIEWS
OF BRITONS
Press Is lot Unanimous in Its
Sympathy for ibe
Japanese,
1l - Concealed Desire That
America Be Drawn Into
Dispute.
United in sentiment and action as
the English people may be, when it :
comes to the actual point of a quarrel
Â¦with any other country the sentiment
of the London press as to the merits
of the Issue between Russia and Japan,
the probable outcome of the war and
the wisdom of the policy of the British
Government in her dealing with the
Question In the past and at the pres
ent time are far from being in ac
cord. The following excerpts from ed
itorials in the "Westminster Gazette
'Liberal) nnd the London Globe (Con
servative) will reflect the attitude of
the two leading political parties on
the Question as to the best policy for
Great Britain to pursue.
The Westminster Gazette, January
29. l? 04, sees great possible trouble for
Britain abroad, and sounds a loud note
of warning to the Russo-phobes. It
says:
"There is no concealing the extreme
gravity of this struggle, not merely
in its results on Far Eastern affairs,
but in the international complications
which may go with It. We have al
ways, as our readers know, regretted
our treaty of alliance with Japan, not
from any unfriendliness to the Japan
ese, but because it seemed to us high
ly important for this country to keep
a free hand in the Far East. The
treaty, however, is a fact which is
bind â¢ on us and which It is useless
to deplore. V. hope and believe that
i will operate, as intended, to isolate
the conflict so far as the Far East
itsslf is concerned.
PERILS IX BRITAIN PATH.
'Our relations with Francs are hap
pily cf the best at this moment, and it
is improbable that the Czar would in
any circumstances demand French as
sistance if he knew that by so doing
he would bring the more formidable
r.aval power of this country into oper- ]
a^ion against him. We may therefore j
reasonably hope that the circumstances i
which the treaty contemplates, namely, i
en alliance of two great powers against
Japan, will not arise. But when war
breaks out the result does not always
conform to the programme, or even to '
reason and common sense. We have to !
reckon with possible explosions of opin- j
ion. forcing the hands of governments, !
and with ail manner of side issues 'Â¦
which might possibly raise points of !
honor and lead to violent agitation be- j
fore we had realized their importance. <
ThÂ«re is the question of the Darda- j
relics, the question of coaling stations
en the road to the Far East, the ques- j
tion of the neutrality of the Suez canal, I
on any one of which our ally might i
expect our asiEtance. And finally there j
is the chance that advantage may be !
taken of Russia's preoccupation to j
force the crisis in the Near East, with ;
all the complications that it threatens i
to" Europe.
"We do" not say that any of these evil
things will happen, but the best se- j
curity against them is to be warned in j
advance and to realize their gravity.
The occasion is one which makes a spe- '
cial demand of prudence and modera- \
tion from public men and writers. To
whip up. public opinion against Russia, j
as in the days when she as at grips j

A PLEASANT SURPRISE
In Store for Those Who Doubt.
"Whtn you read that a sufferer of
many years* standing has been com-
pletely restored to health by using
Smith's Cure-all, you are inclined to
doubt the statement and, in fact, have
co belief in it -whatever. The reason
for this is that so much is claimed for
the Cure-all it ( is impossible for any-
one to believe it; if the advertiser con-
fined his claims to the curing of one
disease, as do the proprietors of Pyra-

much more faith in published testi-
monials. Those familiar with this

mischievous thing to do. English sym
pathy with the Japanese is as natural
as European sympathy with the Boers.
It gr>es out to the party which is sup
posed tn be the smaller, and therefore
the pluckier. But remembering our
own resentment at European attacks
upon us and bearing in mind also the
heavy contingent liabilities which we
have in this matter, we shall do well to
refrain from that kind of exasperation.
Nor shall we too credulously believe re
ports which minimize the strength of
Russia and exaggerate the strength of
Japan. The truth of that matter is
hard to arrive at until tested by events,
but the better and safer plan for the
Japanese and those who sympathize
with thr-m will be to believe that Rus
sia is strong until she is proved to be
weak."
BITTER IN DENUNCIATION.
The London Globe, January 23, de
nounces Russia and predicts a coalition
cf powers to thwart her ambitious
aims. It says:
â¢At the beginning the twentieth cen
tury the role which France, led by
Napoleon played, has been taken by
Russia, led by an insolent and aggres
sive bureauacracy which speaks in tlv;
name of the Czar. In every quarter of
the globe it is Russia who is the dis
turber of nations. The German Gov
ernment knows well enough that it is
the territory of the Russian frontier
v hich needs to be the most closely
Â¦ vatched. The ifoes of Finland and Po
land are the direct result of Russian
cruelty and tyranny. To the tortu
ousne?s of Muscovite policy it is owing
that Europe stands well nigh power
less to enforce order and fair govern
r.i'-nt in tbe Balkan States. Turkey is
tltem&tely threatened and cajoled by
the St Petersburg Government, while
France is compelled by her one-sided
alliance to stand helplessly aside. In
Nsia the policy of Russia is to stir up
strife iid foment unrest at the ex
Â¦ pensr of the British empire in Persia,
Afghanistan, Burrr.ah and Thibet, be
i . idct; th^ flagrantly illegal action she
has taken, and is taking, in defence
of tr>'Â«ty obligations in th? Chinese
empire. In face of these facts we be
j lievo ihat the time is approaching
! .â¢ hen. if Ru.Â«sia will not abate 'her
i pretensions or cease her efforts to ag>
piandizo herself at the expense of the
| trade of the territory ofi well nigh ev
ery other power v. ith whom she is in
] contact, a coalition will have to be
| formed to curb bÂ«r restless and cruel
I ambitions, as hi the case of Napoleon
' ft century ago."
EXPECTS AMERICAN AID.
Again, on January 26, it says:
"Our Shanghai correspondent reiter
! ates the report that China has teen
given full assurance that support will
be forthcoming to enable her to main
tain the integrity of her empire. There
are two powers, the United States and
ourselves, who are specially interested
in checking that policy of practical
partition which is the goal and ob
ject of Russian ambition. For years
past. this has been our ostensible ob
ject, though how woefully we have
failed in pursuing it is matter of his
tory. The United States has come
more recently to a knowledge of the
true inwardness of Russian diplomacy
and the value of Russian promises.
But public opinion on its side of the
Atlantic is growing in volume day by
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1904.
day. An Opportunity^ which has never
yet presented itself, and can never oc- 1
cur again, is now before the States,
which have everything to lose in
China. It is not merely the question
whether Korea is to be ruled at the
beck of Russia or Japan which is at .
issue. There is now a chance of stay- I
ing that relentless march across Asia. :
which for years past has affected the
stability of every power on that con
tinent and has upset the equilibrium
of power in Europe. Much of that
deadly competition which has turned
Europe into an armed camp and laid
so heavy a burden upon the nations is
due to the fixed determination of Rus
sia to bring the tvhole of Asia under
her sway. By standing firm now we
may inflict such a check as will ren
der that ambition impossible of ful
fillment. If we. falter till Russia has
tided over this crisis and had time to
complete hei preparations we may
make ready for the beginning of the
end." *
CONCERN FOR UNCLE SAM.
And again, on January 28, the Globe
denounces the policy of Russia, com
mends the attitude of Japan and pre
dicts harm to interests of the United
States if Russia succeed:
'Japan has assumed the task which
properly belonged to Great Britain,
which with a little firmness, a little
fnre^ight and a little resolution we
might have accomplished while the
I Russian Hercules was stiil in the cra
dle. Japan is contending for the terri
torial independence of China, for equal
rights to all n-itions in the treaty ports
of that empire, for the seclusion of
Russia within her own borders.
"No one now underestimates the
gravity of the danger which overhung
Europe when England fought to keep
her shores inviolate and to maintain
her right to live and to trade. Had St.
Vincent or Nelson been beaten â nay,
even had Sir Arthur Wellesley been
unable to retain his hold on the penin
| sula, the last spark of freedom would
have been extinguished in Eufope. And
now if Japan fails, if her Ministers at
the last moment lose their nerve and
accept those assurances which British
Ministers are so fond of swallowing, an
even blacker cloud win descend on Asia.
The pursuit of Russian aggression is
I disguised under the pretext of consoli
dating the Siberian provinces and ob
taining an outlet on aÂ» ice-free ocean.
That is only one step. Manchuria, the
j possession of which is represented as
essential to the security of the trans-
Siberian railway, is the key to Northern
China. Permanently established there,
the Russians will be supreme in Peking
if, indeed, the Manchu dynasty can sur
vive the seizure by a foreign power of
its ancestral province. Bit by bit, leaf
by leaf, we shall see China becoming
Russianized and the power of every
other foreign nation waning and grow
ing dim. The enormous resources of
China, both In men and in material,
will be at the disposal of a nation suf
ficiently akin to the Celestial in blood
> and in disposition to assimilate as well
las to control. Then, Indeed, will Eu
i rope and the civilized world be brought
i face to face with the yellow peril and
I with a tyranny more nearly comparable
to that of Attila and Genghiz Khan
than of Napoleon. If it be contended
that sufficient for the day is the evil
thereof, we can point out that in the
imnjediate future the failure of Japan
to enforce the retirement of Russia
from Manchuria will entail the exclu
sion from the treaty ports of all foreign
commerce. It will bo a blow to the
United States as much almost as to
ourselves, and while we profoundly
hope that even now the force of events

RUSSIAN EMPIRE, LIKE A BEAR AT BAY,
LASHED INTO FURY UK FIRST DEFEAT
Public Demonstrations of Patriotism Are in Marked Contrast to the
Indifference Displayed While the Peace Negotiations
With Japan Were Being Carried On,
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 13â For the
first time since the beginning of hostili
ties in the Far East the Government
to-night gave the Russian newspapers
permission to publish the accounts re
ceived from abroad of the naval en
gagement' off Chemulpo, in which the
â¢warships Variag and Korutz were de
stroyed.
The war fever which has been aroused
here and apparently throughout the
empire or at least throughout Euro
pean Russiaâ in a single week is truly
remarkable. Such patriotic demonstra
tions as have been witnessed in St.
Petersburg since hostilities began have
been all the more astonishing because
of the public difference during the
period of negotiations and almost up to
the hour when Japan struck the first
blow at Port Arthur. But now, like a
flash, the whole empire seems to have
been lashed into fury by defeat, and,
like a bear when it is wounded and an
gry, it is prepared to fight to the bitter
end. The dreamy Russian character has
been stirred to depths of resentment
which it will be difficult to understand
abroad. *
DISPLAYS OF PATRIOTISM.
The patriotic demonstrations here
have been almost continuous for three
days, and they have been also entirely
spontaneous. Some of them were ex
traordinary in character. To-day the
schoolboys and students of the city,
numbering thousands, marched bare
headed for hours up and down the
Nevsky Prospect bearing flags, shout
ing and singing patriotic airs. They
were followed by an immense crowd.
Like previous processions, this went
to the Annichkoff Palace, where the
Dowager Empress, who is very popular
with the people, showed herself. Later
the boys and students completely sur
rounded the Winter Palace, and, in re
sponse to their cheers, the Czar and
< "zarina made their appearance. When
the Czarina blew kisses to the boys a
vast shout went up, which awakened
the echoes across the Neva. j -
At the French Embassy, which was
next visited by the procession, Madame
Pompard was compelled, .in the ab
sence of the Embassador. to appear at
a balcony and acknowledge the cheers
for Russia's" aJly/c-' ;â¢_.Â£'
SOLDIERS SING FOLK SONGS.
In front of the barracks the regi

national hymn to cheering crowds.
There were demonstrations to-night
outside ihe theaters and the perform
ances going on inside were stopped
ivhile'the orchestra came out on the
street to play folk songs, which the
soldiers sang while marching.
The fact that the pocrhouse pau
pers pay their last cent for the extra
editions of the newspapers and that
the cab drivers do not charge military
men for carrying them around shows
how deeply the feelings of the people
have been penetrated.
Telegrams from almost every town
in European Russia tell the same story.
At Moscow there were great manifes
tations in front of the palace of the
Grand Duke Serge and before the Iber

RUSSIAN DEPRESSION
GIVES WAY TO FEELING
OF FIRM CONFIDENCE
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 13.â
press Is authorized to deny the report
that Japanese troops had landed at
Port Arthur, with the loss of two regi
ments. Nothing is known here official
ly regarding the. movements of the
Vladivostok squadron, but the report
that.it had sunk Japanese transports
off Wusan and destroyed Hakodate are
generally discredited, it being pointed
out that it is impossible for the squad
Â»on to have been in two places almost
simultaneously. A naval expert says
that if the Hakodate story is true Ad
miral Stackelberg, in command of the
Vladivostok squadron, will be able to
go south by the eastern coast of Japan
and cause enormous havoc along the
shore and to shipping and ultimately
effect a junction with Admiral Virenus'
squadron, on its way to the Far East
from Europe. Viceroy Alexieff's silence
about the Vladivostok squadron is ex
plained as follows:
For strategic reasons the Viceroy as
commander in chief is empowered to
dispose of the shirs and men without
consulting: headquarters. The enumera
tion of the Russian ships engaged at
Port Arthur was purposely omitted in
the official report, as it would have
given a valuable clew to the enemy. A
private telegram has been received
frcm a resident of Port Arthur, in
which the sender claims he saw one
Japanese warship sink. The fact that
no mention was made of this in the
Viceroys dispatches does not disprove
the story, because the Viceroy is care
ful not to announce anything outside
of personally established facts. It is
pointed out on high authority that the
Japanese are not likely to admit such a
loss, and it is recalled that during the
Chinese war they were most secretive
about the casualties. The telegraph
line between Port Arthur and the Yalu
River is believed to be broken, which
explains the absence of direct news re
garding the naval engagement off Che
mulpo. However, little doubt is enter
tained here as to the fate of the .Variag
and Korutz. .
The blowing up of the Russian tor
pedo transport Yenisei as a result of
accidentally a mine at Port
Arthur was telegraphed here yester
day, but the news was not given out
until the names of the officers killed
were known, so as to avoid needless
anxiety by the relatives of the surviv
ing officers.
According to the Novoe Vremya, the '.
Yenisei was laying mines at the en
trance of Talienwan Bay. with the
object of closing it against attack
from the rea. Observing that one of |
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 190-i
the mines had risen to the surface, the
Yenisei approached for the purpose of
lifting it up. when the vessel came in
contact with another mine, which ex
ploded and caused the disaster.
The first feeling of depression is dis
appearing and entire confidence is ex
pressed in the ultimate success of the
Russian arms. A distinguished Rus-
Eian said:
"The slight reverses which we sus
tained at the outset have had a good
effect. The Russians no longer de
spise the enemy. That was a mistake
which we made. The Japanese certain
ly are excellent fighters, who will be
treated with the respect they deserve."
Colonel Van Scheck, commanding
the Emperor Alexander Regiment of
the German Guards, of which the Czar
is honorary colonel in chief, arrived
here to-day from Berlin. He will pre
sent to the Czar an autograph letter
from Emperor William. Admiral Ro
jesvenski, chief of the general staff
of the navy, leaves here for the Far
East February 16.
BRITAIN WILL SEND
SEVEN REGIMENTS TO
CANADIAN GARRISONS
HALIFAX, X. S., Feb. 13.â The
British Government is making- inqui
ries concerning the facilities for quar
tering in Canada seven regiments of
troops In addition to those already
there during the war in the East. It
ia proposed to send two regiments to
this city, two to Esquimau, B. C, and
one each to Quebec, Montreal and
Toronto. It is understood that the
Government wishes to station troops
ut these points in order to have them
nearer the scene of hostilities between
Japan and Russia in case complica
tions involving British interests should
develop. While the Government has
forces in India, it is sa^l that it would
not move them because of the dan
ger that soldiers of Afghanistan or
Thibet would quietly cross the Indian
frontier and become a serious men
ace.
LINER AMERICA MARU
REACHES YOKOHAMA
WITHOUT A MISHA?
The Japanese liner America Maru,
Captain Philip Going, arrived at Yo
kohama on February 11. two days
ahead of schedule time. The America
was the last of the Toyo Kisen Kaisha
boats to leave this port. She carried
only about 400 tons of cargo, which
included a large shipment of arms
and ammunition. She carried an ex
tra supply of coal and Captain Going
was prepared for a race with any
thing flying the Russian flag which
might dispute the liner's way.
The >three Japanese steamships that
have been running between here and
the Orient are now in the hands of
the Japanese Government. They are
ready for any service in which they
may be needed.

OFFICIAL AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN FRANCE FAVORS
GIVING EVERY POSSIBLE AID TO THE RUSSIAN CAUSE
PARIS, Feb. 14. â One of the most
notable features of the first week of
the war has been the steady increase
of sentiment favorable to giving Rus
sia every possible moral and sympa
; thetk- support. At the outset the
; French o!h< i;ds and the public gen
! erally maintained that the Interest* of
France demanded that sho keep clear
of the possibility of any war entan
glements growing out of the Franco-
I Russian alliance. This led some
Â¦ newspapers to assert that France was
! placing self-interest before duty and
I deserting her best friend in the hour
|of greatest need. A gradual reaction
1 has occurred, unti; to-day official and
I public feeling runs strongly in favor
I of strengthening Russia in every way
short of octua! participation in the
war. It was thought that ihe large
I Dreyfus element wouid antagonize
Russia, owing to the latter's attitude
; toward the 1 Jews; but. on the con.
: trary. Joseph Ilelnach. the friend and
i biographer of Dreyfus, has published
' a letter declaring that the honor and
j interest of France command her to
j affirm her sympathy for Russia and to
j loyally hold up the alliance.
However, French feeling, which is
Â¦ usually demonstrative, hus not shown
any wild enthusiasm In behalf of Rus
sia. This ia in rather marked con
trast with the uproarious manifesta
tions at the time of the Qzar's visit
to Paris and other recent events.
SUBSCRIPTION LISTS OPENED.
Two popular subscriptions have
been opened for the wounded, one by
the Russo-Chinese Bank and the other
by French newspapers. The Russian
Embassador, N'elidoff. heads the for
mer with a subscription of $100. Many
individuals are showing; personal sym
pathy and are offering their services.
Much interest is manifested here in
the part Prince Louis Napoleon and
Prince Jaime de Bourbon are taking
in the military service of Russia. The
reports that Prince Louis, who is an
officer or high rank In the Russian
cavalry, who was in France recently
to attend the obsequies of Princess
Mathilde and who left hurriedly for
St. Petersburg at the outbreak of the
war, is to be given command of the
entire cavalry force operating In Man
churia, are said to be well founded.
Prince Jaime, who is an officer of
Russian volunteers under the Gov
ernor General of Russian Poland,
wrote on the outbreuk of the war re
questing an assignment to the first de
tachment of volunteers to be sent to

AS TO FRENCH NEUTRALITY.
It is not intended by the French
Government for the present to issue
a formal proclamation of neutrality
similar to that of the United States
and (jieat Britain. The officers here
say usage does not require such a
proclamation and ft is held that the
neutral course of the Government has
been sufficiently defined by the instruc
tions sent by the French Foreign. Co
lonial and Marine Ministers to repre
sentative? abroad. It is especially
Stated that the absence of a proclama
tion has not the slightest significance
as showing a desire to raise Russian
suspicions. It is merely compliance
with the French custom regarding the
observance of neutrality.
. Germany's reported efforts to create
ill-feeling between Russia and France
arc- reePivmg the serious attention of
the French officials, who do not hesi
tate to express the belief that Ger
many wiil vsef-k to make the most of
the opportunity to strengthen her po
sition with Russia and weaken that of
France. There i^ the fullest confi
dence that this will not succeed and
that the Franco-Russian alliance will
remain unshaken.
Strong hopes were expressed to-day
in ofikia!* quarters that the sentiment
in Great Britain and the United States
would not sympathize with the aims
of Germany to disrupt the existing un
derstanding.
JAPANESE OF NOTE
EXPECTS TO SEE THIS
NATION DRAWN IN
CHICAGO. Feb. IS. â "It is extreme
ly probable that the United States and
each of the great powers will do ac
tual fighting before this war is over.
The United States has taken a strong
and courageous position."
Dr. Tokyichi Yenaga, formerly a
secretary in the Foreign Department
of the Japanese Government, made
this prediction to-day. Dr. Yenajj;i
has just completed Â¦ series of lec
tures in Chicago under the auspices of
the University of Chicago. Dr. Yen
aga said:
"All along I have been saying that
the United States and England should
join with Japan in settling this Far
Eastern question in the interests of
modern progressive civilization. The
United States has done just what
Japan wanted. President Roosevelt
and Secretary Hay. by proposing to
limit the question, have taken a very
strong stand, ""le only way to ure
vent a general war in which all th<?
nations would be fighting would be to
carry out the proposal which has been
made by the United States."

ENDS HIS LIFE
William J. Lemp, President of
Large St. Louis Corporation,
Commits Suicide in His Home
SHOOTS HIMSELF IX HEAD
Death of Favorite Son and
of Life-Long Friend Affects
Reason of the Millionaire
ST. LOUIS. Feb. 13.â William J.
Leap, president of the Lemp Brewing
Company, committed suicide to-day at
his residence, 3222 South Eighth street,
by shooting himself In the right temple
with a revolver. He died an hour later.
Depression over the death of his favor
ite son, Fred I^emp. three years ago,
and the loss cf Frederick Pabst of
Milwaukee, a life long friend, is be
lieved to have been the cause for his
rash act. Mr. Lemp, who was 68
years old and a native of Germany,
haÂ« lived in St. Louis for forty-eight
years. He stood high in business and
social circles and was reputed to be
a millionaire.
Mr. Lemp, it seems, was alone in his
room when the shot was fired. Com
plaining of not feeling well, he had not
risen as early as the other members
of the family. Breakfast had been
served and the sons had gone to their
duties at the office and Mrs. Lemp
had gone up town.
The servants were busying them
selves about their daily tasks. A shot
was heard from the direction of Mr.
Lemp's room. The servants, who hur
ried to the apartment, found Mr. Lemp
lying" on the floor, a revolver clutched
m his right hand and a bullet wound
In his temple. One of the servants ran
to the brewery office nearby, and sum
moned the two sons. Edward and Wil
liam.
As soon as they reached the house
they dispatched servants for physi
cians. Several doctor?, who were soon
at the house, found that life was not
extinct, but saw there was no hope of
saving his life. Mr. Lemp was still
breathing when Mrs. Lemp returned
home and died a few minutes later
without having recognized any one.
Mr. Lemp lost interest in life three
years ago hen his son" Frederick died.
He was the brewer's favorite son. the
superintendent of the brewery and the
chief reliance of his father. He died
suddenly of heart failure and the blow
to the father was so severe that he
never recovered from it. At first he
seemed to resist the impulse to with
drew from active life, but after a time
he yielded 10 it and was seldom seen
at his office. Besides the two sons and
his widow, one daughter, who mar
ried a s"ii of Captain Pabst, survive.

PRATT LIBRARY
Noted Institution of Balti
more Escapes the Fury of
the Disastrous Conflagration
RAPID GROWTH IN SOUTH
New Uuildi' g Will Soon Be
Erected for the Accommoda
tion of the Los Angeles Public
The city of Los Angeles proposes to
erect a public library building:. For
many years the public library has oc
cupied quarters on the third floor of
the City Hall. These have become,
by the growth of the patronage of the
library and the accumulation of books,
cramped and inconvenient. A worse
evil is also in sight, for the weight
of the volumes added to that of the
visitors to the library produces a dan
j gerous strain upon the walls of the
I building. A committee of architects
Â¦ recently examined the City Hall and
j recommended that the floors of the
j library should be strengthened, but
j nothing has been done. As a partial
relief the newspaper files are to be
removed to rooms in the new building
of the Chamber of Commerce.
Under the lead of the library board
an advisory committee of five local
architects was appointed three months
ago to consider the question of a new
library building of ample size for the
i city's need. This committee in their
recent report advises that a building
be erected, to contain an art gallery
! and museum in the upper story and to
; cost, with all fixtures and furnishings,
the sum of $450,000, to be obtained
by a bond issue. Central Park is sug
gested as a site, w : th the understand
; ing that the building should encroach
j on park ground as little as possible.
LIBRARIES IN THE SOITH.
Southern California has long been
distinguished for its numerous free
, libraries. Every nourishing town
I early starts a public reading-room,
, which speedily adds to its resources
a circulating library. The number of j
public libraries in that region is soon
to be increased by one to be built in
Highland Park, a suburb of Los An- \
geles. Charles 1C Stimson of Los
Angeles has promised to contribute '
$15,000 toward the cost of a $25,000 \
building, with the stipulation that Oc- j
cidental College sliall have supervision |
of the library, which is to be for the Â¦
joint use of the college students and j
the people of Highland Park. The <
building will be modeled after the ;
new Pomona public library and will j
occupy an eligible site on Pasadena .
avenue.
One of the most important functions
of the modern public library is to sup
ply authorities for general reference
and research work. In Redding, M. E.
Dittmar. one of the local editors, re
cently went to the new library to con
sult an encyclopedia, but to his surprise
found that the library owned none. De- !
termined that tho library should no j
longer be thus destitute, he presented
the library with a complete set of
Chambers' Encyclopedia of the latest
edition.
John Galen Howard, the supervising
architect of the State University, has
gone East for the purpose of examining
various library buildings with reference
to perfecting the plans for the new li
brary building for the university, made
possible by the bequest from Charles
F. Doe of $600,000.
VILLAGE LIBRARIES.
It is a significent feature of the newly
awakened library movement in Cali
fornia that the villages and small
towns are establishing reading-rooma
and libraries. Nowhere else are they '
more needed. Randolph, a hamlet near
Sierravllle, Sierra County, is the latest
place reporting a new library. It is
managed on the membership plan, has
attractive rooms and starts with 300
volumes and many periodicals.
Some of the leading libraries of the
country occasionally render a special
service to the country at large by pub
lishing lists of choice books. The New
ark, N. J., free library, of which John
Cotton Dana is librarian, has lately Is
sued a pamphlet of 1700 titles of chil
dren's books, embracing a portion of
those on the shelves of the well- i
equipped juvenile rooms. These selec- â¢
tions are of history, science, travels,
adventures, poetry and that which is
ever dear to the heart of a childâ the
story of real life, and others which are
imaginative. The purpose of the selec
tion is to commend to general use only |
those works which are strong and en
nobling. This list will be helpful to
school trustees. board 3of education
and librarians. A request, accompanied
by a few stamps, will doubtless procure :
a eery Â°Â° ll ' :is I'-st1 '- st -
BEQUEST FOR MALDEX.
In Maiden. Mass., the public, library j
has received a bequest of $15,000 by ;
the will of the late Mr?. Mary Con- ,
verse, the income of the fund to be j
expended in the purchase of works of j
art.
The Milwaukee, Wis., public library
received a Christmas gift of a fine I
stained glass window, costing $700, for j
the children's room. The window
represents the kindly story teller,
Hans Christian Andersen, with the
children. The money for this gift j
was raised by public subscription.
In the overwhelming destruction of
important buildings last Sunday in
Baltimore it is a satisfaction to note i
that the Enoch Pratt free library of ,
that city has apparently escaped un
harmed. Had it been destroyed its !
loss would have been felt severely. J
Every public library that is well sus- j
tamed grows not only by the pur
chases made for it, but by the pre- J
sentation of books, manuscripts and ;
other works of great rarity, which in I
time become of priceless value and
whese loss cannot be remedied.
It is over a score of years since the
Enoch Pratt free library was founded. Â¦
It now has erven branches and three \
delivery stations, and through these
and the main library is doing a great |
educational work. This library has ;
but a nominal income from taxation,
as its support comes almost entirely
from the endowment given by its !
founder, Enoch Pratt, of $1,-50,000.
DEATH CALLS
WELL-KNOWN
WAR VETERAN
WELL - KNOWN BUSINESS
MAN OF THIS CITY WHO
DIED YESTERDAY.
Joseph Simonson of
Thomas Post, G. A.
R., Passes Away.
Joseph Simonson. a well-known
comrade of George H. Thomas Post,
Grand Army of the Republic, and a
prominent member of the Union
League Club and Fidelity Lodge, An
cient Order of United Workmen, died
at a sanitorium on Golden Gate avenue
yesterday afternoon. The announce
ment of his death caused a feeling of
profound sorrow at the Union League
Club and elsewhere, as he had many
friends who appreciated his noble
traits of character and his excellent
qualities of mind and heart.
Mr. Simonson was engaged in active
business pursuits, being president of
the Roberts Manufacturing Company.
He came to San Francisco from New
York in 1877. Early in the Civil War
he served in the celebrated Seventh
New York Regiment. He took quite
an active part in Grand Army affairs
in this State and was regularly chosen
as one af the representatives of George
H. Thomas Post to the annual depart
ment encampment.
Ho gave time and attention also to
the upbuilding of the Union League, of
which institution ho whs at one time
secretary. Mr. Simonsor.'s age was 70
years 6 month?.
Another Storm Is Impending.
Reports of cloudy weather, rame from
nearly pvery town in the State last
night and Professor McAdie was in
clined to think that another storm was
on the way here. Some of the south
ern towns will have clear skies to-day,
but cloudy weather is the prediction
for that part of California north of
the Tehachapi.

MAKE PEACE WITH
YOUK STOMACH
You Arc Certain to liose if You At-
tempt the Use of Force and
Violence.
You <annot force your stomach to do
work that it i 3 unable and unwilling
to do. It has bf>en tried time and time
again with always the same result.
The stomach is a good and faithfui
servant, but when pushed beyond the
limit it rebels. Some stomachs will
stand much more abuse than others,
but every stomach has its limit, and
v. hen that limit is reached it is a very
dangerous and unwise proceeding to
attempt to force it into doing further
work. The sensible and reasonable
course la to employ a substitute to
I carry on the work of digestion and give
I the stomach an opportunity to recu-
| perate and regain its lost strength.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
only perfect substitute to take up and
carry on the work of tired, worn out
stomachs. They natural and easy
in their work and cause no disturb-
ance in the digestive organs. They con-
tain all of the essential elements that
make up the gastric juice and other
digestive fluids and will digest any
food that a strong, healthy stomach
will, and do it in the same time and
in the same way. They work indepen-
dently of surrounding conditions and
the fact that the stomach is weak or
diseased docs not influence them at all
in their useful and effective work.
They will digest food just as well in
a glass jar or bottle as they will Jn a
stomach. You can see that for your-
self by putting one of them into a jar
with a square meal and some water to
enable it to work.
Stuart's Dyspspsia Tablets, by thus
relieving the stomach of Its work, en-
able that organ to rest and recuperate
and regain its health and strength.
The process is perfectly natural and
plain. Nature will heal the stomach
just as she heals a wound or a broken
limb, if she is not interfered with and
is permitted to do her work in her own
way. All interference is prevented by
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by druggists everywhere at 50
cents a box and if you are afflicted
with dyspepsia, one box v,-ill make you
feel 50 times better. You will forget
you have a stomach and rejoice in the
forgetfulness. No druggist would be
so short-sighted as to try to get along
without Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets,
for . .ey are so popular and are so well
known for the good they have done
and the happiness they have caused
that any druggist caught without them
would lose the confidence of his cus-
tomers and be regarded as below the
standard. His business would suffer as
a result and his patrons would go to
other stores and buy their other drugs
there as ell as their Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets

Gossip in Political Camps That
W. Frank Pierce Will Be

The appointment of W. Frank Pierce
as Prison Director !Â¦> succeed K. M.
1 FitzgeraM would not surprise wftll post
ed politicians. It is reported "n good
authority that the name of Pierce is
already inscribed on the Governor's
; slate. It is common gossip that neither
! Senator Charles M. Belshaw nor Col
! onel Charles Sonntag is quite accept
! able at the executive office for the posi
tion of Prison Director. The Governor,
it is said, entertains hiprh regard for
Belshaw as a Native Son and as a
statesman, and for S^nntagr as a col
onel and a di]Â«l miat, hut neither re
sides In Alai. eda County. W. Frank
Pierce, it is paid, possesses all the ele
ments of a good Director as well as
the additional advantage of dwelling
in the county of Alameda. He is presi
dent of the Standard Electric Company.

PATTOSIEX WILL RETIRE
ACCOUNT OF ILL HEALTH
In the Enforcement of Low Prices
One Man's Misfortunes Benefit
an Entire Community.
The marvelous success that has at
tended the sale of furniture by the Patto
sien Company in the Mission has been
the chief topic of conversation in furni
ture circles during the past ten days.
An enormous quantity of merchandise
has been sold and at prices that would
seem to confirm the announcement that
Mr. Pattosien has fully determined to
retire from the business. Aside from
these- facts there were floating about va
rious rumors as to Mr. Pattosien's even
tual plans. To set at rest these sto
ries an interview was arranged and the
following information elicited from Mr.
Pattosien, the founder, president and
manager of the company. Said he:
"There are, I am aware, numerous ru
mors afloat concerning me and the fu
ture of this busineaa. It is said that I
have rented a new and much larger
building on Mission street, not far from
Third. Also that our present store, after
the present sale is finished, will be re
modeled into an apartment house, with
! stores on the first floor. Ag-ain, that this
j business is being eagerly sought by
j large furniture dealers of this and sur
i rounding towns. Ido not deem it worth
| while to specifically deny these and every
I story that may be started, but for the
: benefit of those interested would say that
| following the advice of my physician I
j am soon to retire from active business
i until I can regain my lost strength, due
j to the severe accident I met with in be
ing thrown from my buggy several weeks
ago. A meeting of our board of directors
j was called, and by resolution it was
unanimously decided to close up the
i business by holding an absolute bona
; fide closing-out sale. That we have done
! this has b^en e%'idenced to every pur
chaser by the noteworthy cut In prices
that has marked the sale. Our prices
have never been equaled by any other
sale recorded in San Francisco. It may
be asked by some why I have decided to
close out this business, why it should
j not continue during my absence under
j the care of employes. My candid an
; Kwer to that question is, 1 do not know
, of any one at present connected with this
company who is capable of conducting it
i as it should tM conducted and as I nave
i been accustomed to conduct it. I would
; therefore prefer to clear my mind of all
; worries and care and resign myself to
'Â¦ absolute rest and rrcuperation. My mind
; is fully determined and the balance of
, this stock of merchandise must be sold
|in the next Fix we'4:s. It mrans a big
I sacrifice. I know, but one's health and
1 peace of mind is th<- &rat consideration."

GRAPE-NTTTSu I
WELL TOLD.
Doctor Explains Feeding Without
Medicine.
"It Is a well substantiated fact," says j
a Maine physician, "that a very large !
per cent of the ailments of humanity j
are due to errors in diet, causing mdi- j
gestlon and the myriad affections fol-
lowing in its train. It was Dr. Aber-
nathy, I believe, who said, 'One-fourth
of what we eat keeps us, the other
three-fourths we keep at our peril.'
"Loss of flesh from whatever immedi-
ate cause is due primarily to nutritional
disturbances involving defective assim-
ilation. With these prefatory remarks
I wish to relate briefly a case of mine
(not the only one by any means), in
which Grape-Nuts was the connecting
link between disease and health.
"It was a case of chronic gastritis,
where the patient had seen the rounds
of much stereotyped treatment and
where there was much depression
caused by long persistence of distress
at the stomachâ pain, gas and burning
soon after eating.
"Though I had been regulating the
diet considerably while giving medicine,
it occurred to me that I would try reg-
ulating it without medicine, and in
looking about among the foods I soon
found Grape-Nuts was the best adapt-
ed to my purpose. Starting in with
Grape-Nuts alone I allowed my patient
! to take it first with hot water and a
very little sugar at intervals of three
hours. After a few days I instructed
the patient to use it with warm milk.
(It should have been served with cream
on the start.)
"Improvement w T as marked from the
first. The eructations of gas were at
once greatly diminished and the terrible
burning and distress were lessened in
proportion, while the spirits brightened.
At the end of two weeks my patient
had so far improved that she was al-
lowed some chicken broth, which di-
gested perfectly. It has been over two
months and she has gradually in-
creased her diet in variety until it now
includes all that is needed to avoid
monotony and maintain relish.
"Grape-Nuts, however, still holds a
prominent place on her table, as it will
continue to do, for she realizes that it
is a sheet anchor." Name of the phy-
sician given by Postum Co., Battle

EXCURSION' TO CHICO.
An excursion auction sale is an
nounced to take place in Chico on Feb
ruary 22 under the auspices of Easton,
Eldridge & Co., the well known realty
agents and auctioneers, who are inter
ested in the development of all por
tions of the State. A special train, to
which will be attached Pullman sleep
ers, will leave San Francisco on the
evening of Sunday, February 21, pass
ing through Sacramento about mid
night, to arrive in Chico Monday morn
ing, and leaving Chico to arrive in
San Francisco early Tuesday morning
and stopping at Sacramento during the
night. The special round trip excur
sion rate from San Francisco to Chico
and return has been set at $5 40, and
the special rate from Sacramento to
Chico and return will be $3 90. These
tickets from Sacramento will be good
on any train leaving Sacramento Sun
day, the 21at, including the excursion
train, which will arrive In Sacramento
at midnight, and will be good to re
turn leaving Chico up to Tuesday, the
23d. Illustrated catalogues of the sale,
descriptive of the property to be of
fered, will be found at the depot of
the Southern Pacific Railway, and also
the advertisements may be found in
the lqcal Sacramento papers. Messrs.
Easton, Eldridge & Co. report that al
ready considerable inquiry has been
made concerning the excursion and the
sale and requests have been made for
their descriptive catalogue of the prop
erty to be handled, which is the Hum
boldt Addition, lying in the heart at
Chico, comprising large town subdivi
sions and smaller villa acreage parcels.
The wonderful development of the up
per Sacramento Valley from an agri
cultural, mineral, manufacturing and
industrial point of view has received
a great impetus by the extensive im
provements of the Diamond Match
Company, which have involved an ex
penditure of nearly $3,000,000, includ
ing the broad gauge standard railway
from Chico to the timber line, about
thirty miles away, and also the ex
tensive manufacturing plant, consist
ing of over a dozen buildings erected
at a cost of $1,000,000. This means per
manent employment to over 2500 peo
ple. As a result of these natural and
local advantages Chiccr has forged to
tha front and its population has ma
terially increased within the last two
years, with excellent promise of fur
ther growth. The holiday is an excel
lent opportunity to land seekers gen
erally who desire to see this growing
portion of the State and without any
loss of business hours view a remark
ably productive section of California.
THE OCEANSIDE CLUB.
The Oceanside Improvement Club
has elected the following officers:
D. H. Biggs, president; Charles T.
Patriarche, vice president; J. Herzog,
secretary; J. Mohns, financial secre
tary; Paul Jaenicke, treasurer: Robert
Fitzgerald. A. O. Campbell, F. Gott
fried, R. M. Wood and George W. Lee,
executive committee. Messrs. Patri
arche, Campbell, Hastings and Stohl
were appointed a committee to confer
with the Sunset Improvement Club in
regard to the opening of H street. A
committee reported that the water
company was laying the water mains
on Forty-sixth, Forty-seventh and
Forty-eighth avenues, from H to J
streets. A resolution was adopted
thanking Engineer Schussler of the
water company for the prompt action
in supplying the Oceanside district
with water mains. The rapid increase
in the number of school children from
twenty-seven to sixty-four in the last
year, necessitating more commodious
quarters, a committee was appointed
to ask the Board of Education to re-
relieve the overcrowded condition of .
the Oceanside School. The school
room on I street being too small to
accommodate the large membership of
the Oceanside Improvement Club,
meetings will hereafter be held at the
residence of J. HerzOg on Forty-ninth ,
avenue, or until the large hall on the
boulevard is completed.
The California Fruit Canners' Asso
ciation will erect a three-story and
basement brick cannery on the south
west corner of Battery and Green
streets.
May C. Raum will erect a three
stÂ»ry and basement fiat building on the |
west line of Julian avenue, 100 feet
south of Fourteenth street, to cost
$11,000.

IKAT OF SCIENCE
I ronch Investigator Discovers That
Light Emanates 1-Yom the
Human Body.
LONDON, Feb. 13.â The latest scien
tific discovery is "X-rays."' the great
est mystery of radiation, in a word- hu
man rays thrown off by the muscular
and the- nervous activity of our own
corruptible bodies. At least, that is
what is claimed by certain writers for
the work of M. Blondlot and Dr. Char
penticr, two Frenchmen.
At present we are asked to believe
that if a man expose his naked chest
to a acreeo of calcium-sulphide, some
thing of the same kind of bombardment
will be witnessed there as in the case
with radium. That is to say, particles
of Batter are continually being thrown
off by the human frame, and these par
ticles of matter become "'visible" on a
phosphorescent screen.
At a recent meeting of the Academy
of Scienc-es in Paris, a member de
clared that throughout their existence,
even vegetables emit i?ys of light

ding to Blondlot and Charpentier.
emanate from thf> human body.
Another eavant road a paper an
nouncing that radium, has a paralyzing
effect on certain vegetables and. par
ticularly, is apt to blierht the young life
of the smaller mushrooms. This has
greatly discouraged those who put up
champignons in tins.

FEAR VANDALS
Maryland Governor's Refusal
to Solicit Aid of Federal
Troops Causes Disappointment
BALTIMORE, Feb. 13.â There fs some
disappointment, especially among busi
ness men who have valuable property
buried under the ruins, over the deter
mination not to send Federal troops
here, but Governor Warfield is firm in
his insistence that the soldiers are not
needed. In a statement to-day he said:
"There has not been a conflict of
opinion between the members of the
Legislature and myself with regard to
bringing Federal troops to Baltimore to
aid the militia and the police. The res
olution of the Legislature requesting
that Federal troops be sent was passed
under the impression that the State
troops and police were becoming worn
out by reason of the length of time they
were required to be at their posts.
"I ascertained, however, that the fire
district was. sufficiently patrolled and
that the men were relieved at such in
tervals as would afford them' sufficient
rest. There has never been a moment
that the peace and good order of the
city have been threatened. Aid would
have been gladly accepted from the
National Government had there been
any need, but there have been no con
ditions that would justify the bringing
of Federal troops to Baltimore."
The volume of. business done in Balti
more this week has been tremendous,
and possibly exceeded that oÂ£ any
month in its previous history.
Miss Alice Roosevelt, accompanied by
Messrs. Wads worth and Long, came to
Baltimore late this afternoon to take a
view of the ruins. The party was al
lowed to drive through the burned dis
trict.
At its meeting to-day it was the view
of the members of the relief committee
that Baltimore and Maryland are am
ply able to provide for all exigencies,
and that there will be r.o appeal for
outside aid. Mayor McLane said to-day
that the people of Baltimore, though
thankful for the generbus offers of aid,
are resolved to trust to the local spirit
of self-reliance to. meet all emergencies.
Governor. Warfield has received a
large number of letters and telegrams
of ' sympathy, including a telegram
from the Governor of Oregon.
American Army Complimented.
LONDON, Feb. 13.â Field Marshal
Lord TVolseley.. formerly commander in
chief of the British army, has written
again in reference to the decline in mil
itary recruiting in Great Britain. He
reaffirms his belief in the superiority of
the army of the United States, saying:
"The American Government is wiser
than ours. They pay their men well,
with the result that the American
army, so far As it goes in numbers, is
the Miriest in the world. Until we adopt
a similar method of obtaining: recruits
ourarmy never will be in a thoroughly
satisfactory state.'*
SEXTON ML'ST REMAIN
BEHIND PRISON BARS
Folsom Convict Makes Ineffectual At
tempt to Secure His Release by
Means of Habeas Corpus.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 13.â Judge
Hughes of the Superior Court has dis
hiissed the habeas corpus proceedings
of John E. Sexton, who attempted by
this means to secure his release from
the State prison at Folsom. Sexton
was convicted in the Superior Court
at Placerville of the crime of extort
ing money from a cigar dealer, whom,
he caught refilling cigar boxes. His
plea was that as his act had to do
with a violation of Federal law, the
State courts had no jurisdiction. The
court decided that this contention Is
not well taken.
It is said Sexton was eager to get
out of Folsom prison because he is
afraid the convicts will kill him, as
he took part in the pursuit of the" con
victs who escaped from the prison
last July.

We Shall Spend $500,000
This Company, after testing Liquo-
zone for two years in the most diffi-
cult germ diseases, paid $100,000 for
tlic American rights. That is the
highest price ever paid for similar
rights on any scientific discovery.
We are now spending $500,000 to
give the product away â one bottle to
each of a million sick ones. We are
doing this so that every sick one may
let Liquozone itself prove what it
can do.
Kills Inside Germs
The greatest value of Liquozone
lies in the fact that it kills germs in
the body without killing the tisues.
too. And no man knows another way
to do it. Any drug that kills germs is
a poison, and it cannot be taken in-
ternally. Medicine is almost helpless
in any germ disease, as every physi-
cian knows.
Licmozone will do for sick humanity
more than all the drugs in the world
combined. It does what no skill can
accomplish without it. It cures dis-
eases which medicine never cured.
Acts Like Oxygen
Liquozone is the result of a process
which, for more than 20 years, has
been the constant subject of scientific
and chemical research. Its virtue* are
derived solely from gas, made in large
part from the best oxygen producers.
By a process requiring immense ap-
paratus and 14 days' time these gases
RIVAL SALT COMPANIES
FORCE A CUT IN PRICES
Quotations Sent Out to Customers Are
Said to Be Ixwest Ever Reached
on the Coast.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13.â Another big
drop in the price of salt took place yes
terday, when one of the Southern Cal
ifornia companies issued quotations to
their customers said to be the lowest
ever reached on the Pacific Coast. For
more than six months the five rival
salt companies of Southern California
have been engaged in heated warfare,
as a result of which the price of salt
has declined mere than 50 per cent
during that period. Dairy salt is now
quoted at $8 50 and rock salt at $7.
The company making the last cut as
cribed overproduction as a reason. It
is expected that the rival companies
will meet the latest cut or possibly
lower It and that other reductions will
follow.
Sentenced for Burglary.
James Wilson, who was convicted
by a jury in Judge Dunne's court of
a charge of burglary, was sentenced
yesterday to serve four years in Fol
som penitentiary. On the night of
October 27 he broke into the saloon
of H. Maas & Son. 228 Howard street.
To Give Liquozone Away
are. made part of the liquid product
' The result is a product that doc?
what oxygen does. Oxygen gas. as
you know, is the very source of vital-
ity, the most essential element of life.
Liquozone is a vitalizing tonic with
which no other known product* â¢ can
compare. Yet it is a : germicide so cer-
tain that publish ' on 'every bottle
an offer of $1000 for a disease germ
that it cannot kill. i. /^ -
The "'reason ! is that ] germs are vege-
tables; and Liquozone, which like
oxygen â is life to an animal, is deadly
to vegetal : matter. It is carried by
the blood to every cell of every, tissue.
and no touch of impurity, no germ of
disease, can exist where Liquozone
goes.
Germ Diseases
These are the known germ diseases.
All that medicine {can do for these
troubles is to help Nature , overcome
.the: germs/ arid such results fare indi-
rect and uncertain. Â¦ Liquozone .kills
the germs, wherever they are, and the
results are inevitable. By destroying
the i cause of the trouble, it invariably
ends the disease, and forever:;.

c
Great Mass of Soil and Rock
Is Moving Slowly Toward j
the Railroad Track at Wirt;
TRAINS ABE IN DANGER
- -
Every Possible Precaution Is 'Â¦
Being Taken by Workmen to '
Avert a Disaster at Siding
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLFAX, Feb. 13. â The station- i
house at Wirt is in great danger of
being crushed at any moment. The
heavy rains of Friday loosened the j
soil and rocks on the mountainside ;
above and this morning a great mass
towering seventy-five feet above the j
; station began slowly to move down.
j The operator saw that things were in ,
: a serious condition and Resident En- ;
; gineer F. C. Miller and Roadmaster
iH. B. Tltcomb were wired for im- j
[ mediately. Upon their arrival a care
â¢ ful inspection of the mountainside was |
| made and it was discovered that great
i fissures had opened in the side of the
Â¦I mountain for 100 feet back from the
j face of the cliff. The fissures extend |
! parallel with the track for a distance
! of 350 feet and vary from a few inches
!to six feet in width. Since morning ,
the hillside has moved down six feet
;or more. All persons not obliged to
; remain for duty have been ordered
! away.
The siding is buried for a distance
Of 100 feet and the force of men at I
work is constantly in great peril from j
i falling rocks. Engineer Miller and
j Roadmaster Titcomb state that they \
I estimate that from sixteen to twenty
thousand cubic yards of earth and rock
are moving down the slide. They con- ;
! Rider the peril grave and are using
; every means to avert a disaster. A '
I crew of fifty Greeks with a steam
i shovel has been ordered to be on hand ;
J ready for an emergency.
'So sure are we that we are going
to have trouble," said Titcomb. "that
we are acting just as if it had already |
occurred. The trouble is more serious
because the snow blockade has been
lifted and all delayed trains must pass
this perilous point. We have ordered \
1 the engineers not to stop at Wirt and
Â¦ to run slowly, for the slightest jar
may start the whole mass and crush
some train. It is one of the most se
; rious propositions we have faced for
; some time. Should the mass not fall
1 before Sunday morning blasts will be ,
1 used to help dislodge it."

SENATOR SAYS
COIN WAS PAID
ST. LOUIS. Feb. 13.â Argument on
tfct demurrer of United States Senator
J. R. Burton of Kansas to the indict
ment charging him with using his of
ficial position to prevent the issuance
of a postofflce fraud order against the
Rialto Grain and Securities Company
and receiving for such services $2500,
was begun before Judge Adams in the
United States District Court to-day.
Senator Burton's contention is that
the extent of the United States' interest
in the matter was the issuance of an
order which would serve to stop the
transmission of mail to and from the
company, and that no question of gov
ernmental interest or policy was in
volved. He contended through his at
torney. Judge Chester Krum, that no
law of the United States was violated
by him; that the United States has no
legitimate interest in the efforts of the
Rialto Grain and Securities Company
to prevent the issuance of a fraud or
der against it. Senator Burton was in
court.
In hi? demurrer he admits that he ac- j
cepted the money from the company,
but says he did bo merely as an attor- .
ney, and that he did not agree to use
Ma influence as Senator in preventing
the issuance of a fraud order.
District Attorney Dyer in answer con
tended that Senator Burton acted
against the Interests of the United
States, and that his alleged action in
ac cepting a fee for using his position as
a Senator to influence the postal au
thorities against the issuance of a
fiaud order was clearly an offense
against the laws, as proven by the
statutes enacted from 1854 to ISTS.
The attorneys for th*Â» defense took
exception to the fact that the indict
ment ngainet Senator Burton did not
charge the Rialto Grain and Securities ,
Company with having .violated the pos
fcftl laws. After the conclusion of the ;
arguments by the defense court ad- ;
journed. Briefs were filed by both
sjdea, and Judge Adams took the mat- j
ter under advisement.

REBEL BULLETS
KILL AMERICAN
WASHINGTON. Feb. 13. â The State
Department has received a report by
mail under date of San Domingo, Feb
ruary 2, from United States Minister
Powell of the killing by rebels of J.
G. Johnson, the second-class machin
ist of the American cruiser Yankee on
the morning of the date.
The facts have been briefly given in
press dispatches, but the details fur
nished by the Minister tend to estab
lish the fact that the killing was un
provoked and deliberate. He said:
"This was ho accident, but delib
erately done, as during the morning
they (the insurgents) had been firing
on two signal men, who were waiting
tor the launch. One of these men.
T. Horning, had a bullet go through
his Hat. Half an inch lower he would
have been killed."
The Minister acted with promptness
in communicating with Commander
Heilner of the Yankee and informing
the Foreign Minister of the outrage.
j He added:
"I have addressed a note to the
commander of the revolutionary
forces, demanding ample satisfaction
for this insult aad for the death of
I
this man, which I shall send by a
strong guard to the commander."
Samuel W. Hammers, who keeps
a country store near Gettysburg. Pa.,
advertised for a wife recently, and in
the course of a few days received an
swers from 2700 women.

(Coprright, IDM. by Joseph B. Eo-wles.)
The unwritten laws of the natives
are very clearly defined, and they are
very strictly enforced. They are a tri
fie severe, but they serve their end. The
native is a born lawyer. He can follow
Jtn intricate argument, keeping all the
points in his mind, and weighing them
in a judicial spirit, but he is fond of
oratory, and is apt to be swept off his
feet for the moment by the speech o*
an eloquent advocate. When among
the Ingimo on the Sanga River I hap
pened to enter one of their principal
villages as a trial for adultery was go-
Ing on, and the people bottled up their
curiosity at the advent .of the white
man until the trial was finished. The
courthouse was a building erected
across the main street of the village,
and was used as a sort of clubhouse or
common loafing place for the men. It
was built of logs set in the ground and
overlapping each other in an artistic
manner. It* was very strongly built,
and was evidently meant to be the cit
adel of the village in the event of an
attack. All the people of the village
were present at the trial. The accused
parties were bound from head to foot,
wrapped Â¦uith cords like an Egyptian
mummy, and lay upon their backs be
fore the judges. The woman under
trial was the wife of a prince named
Ingoko. Ingoko was the prosecutor.
As be commenced his speech he held in
his hand twelve sticks about the size of
Â¦ lead pencil. He was an eloquent
speaker and had the people laughing
and gnashing their" teeth by turns.
Somt times he would pause and ask
questions Âf those who seemed to be
witnesses. "Whenever he scored a point,
with the consent of the judges and also
of the people, who were the jury in the
casf. he placed one of the sticks in a
basket. "When the last stick was de
posited in the basket the captives be
gan to howl, for they knew that the
verdict had gone against them. If the
people had not been satisfied on any
point they would not have permitted
the prosecutor 0 lay down a stick, and
ft was understood that if fewer than
six sticks had been deposited the pris
oners would' have been acquitted.
When we asked the pepole what they
were going to do with the prisoners,
one of them answered by drawing a
knife across his throat. Efforts were
made to secure their release, but all
that could be done was to get a stay of
proceedings. On our return a few days
after we could hear ' nothing- about
them.
When at the village of fttbally, son
of Bangassou, I was eye witness to
another triaL It was about a woman,
as nearly all African trials are. In
this case there had been a love affair
between a chiefs daughter and a man
of low degree. The daughter had been
given to Eayanzy. a small M'Sacklaw
chief, and her lover had followed her
to her new home. They were too
friendly to suit the chief. He accused
his wife of unfaithfulness: the poison
Â¦w as given to a chicken, and the chicken
died; so it was the lover's turn to
take the poison. # But the father of the
woman happened to be in favor with
Mbally and got the case tried before
him as Supreme Judge. All the people
turned out to the trial in their best
fig leaf dresses and were bent on hav
ing a holiday. although two lfVes were
at stake. They commenced the day by
beating on a tom-tom drum, which ex
ercise was interrupted by copious togo
drinking. When the revel was over
Mbally took his seat in the Judicial
chair in a large open square. The
friends of the accused ranged them
selves in separate groups and sat fac
ing one another. The discussion was
opened by the outraged husband. He
Â¦was slo-w of speech .â¢2nd sat when
speaking. He would utter a sentence
and then wait for a minute to gather
his thoughts. His speech was not very
rfCective from an oratorical point of
v>v. When he was through Mbally
smoked and drank togo. The father
of the -woman whom the chicken had
Moved faithless next "spoke. He was
an orator and it was manifest from
the affirmative grunts which his speech
cikilcd that he carried his audience
with' him. Mbally asked a few ques
tions, sfter which 1 the lover made his
defense. He knew that he was plead
ing for his lire, sad whether it was
love or fear that loosened his tongue,
ho Fpcke well. After he had finished
Mbally as!;cd time to digest the'a'rgu
irtcnts presented on both sides, which
he doubtless did when taking a nap
iÂ«i sleep off the effects of excessive togo
drinking. He promised to announce his
verdict later, but it was. clear that his
:.ui;ude in the 'case was that of the
Dutch Judge who said that he would
go over all the points in the case, and
after sleeping over the matter^Vouia"
give his decision in the morning in fa
vÂ«t of the plaintiff.
Â£fti"3iige to say, thess ocooie have
cosies. They arc divided into nobles.!
firtmea and slaves. One may be born
noble, but cannot acquire this distinc
tion. From among the nob]pÂ« is chosen !
the macconsy, or King, The palaver is '!
an assembly of the chiefs and freoroen", '
over v.fcich the King presides. Th<! â¢
chiefs of the different villages have a I
right to hold separate palavers, at i
uLJc-li they have tom-tom dances and
drink paltn wine. These are great occa
*lonÂ£. a crier soes through the villages
.beating his gong and telling where the
"palaver is to be held. When the repre
sentatives of the villages are assembled
the King or some one in whom the
King has confidence presides over the
meeting. '<]*Â¦â¢':?:
At a royal palaver the freemen, pre
ceded by the chiefs, assemble in com
pany. Sometimes the King 1 opens? the
debate in person: sometimes a friend
of the King announces the object of the
meeting. None dares to interrupt his
speech. They then separate and talk
over the matter in hand. Then the op
posing chiefs take the rostrum. The de
bate often runs high, but, as in. higher
civilized assembles, the best reasoner
takes the victor y.
When the discussion is finished the
assembly is treated to palm wine by
the King, for which he taxes all his
tribe. The native orator comes to these
palavers without arms. An African
proverb /says, "Let. the man say his
mouth out, one does not kill with the
tongue." "Never get mad at words" is
another proverb, and an African sel
dom does. They know, hovyever, that
palm wine deadens the senses, so they
wisely hold their court before drinking.
At the conclusion of the meeting they
never permit any disputant to have the
last word, but the Whole assembly rises
and pronounces it, and any one who
does not respect this rule or forgets it
is chased out of the assembly and aft
erward has no right to occupy himself
with its affairs.
. â¢ â¢ '--' â¢ !
Cannibalism has been a 'universal
practice among the tribes of Africa.
It is the outgrowth of the ancient ob
servance of eating witches, or people
supposed to possess magic power, as
a means of distributing the magic pow
er equally and in homeopathic doses
among the living.- This view is con
firmed by the interesting fact that
when a leopard is killed not only is its
blood used in making a sign upon the
foreheads of the children, but every
part of it is eaten, because they think
that its flesh will impart strength find
cunning. There are many Instances
where the natives eat the flesh of an
animal because of some quality pecu
liar to it, that in this way they may
partake of its desirable traits. Thus
the flesh of the panther is supposed
to confer cunning, that of the monkey
agility. Human flesh is supposed to
impart still higher qualities. The blood
is used for fetishes, even to the last
drop.
The more conservative tribes In Af
rica at present eat only witches, and
from their mountain top of virtuosity
regard the people who make a com
mon practice of man eating as Boobos.
Many are the tribes who have learned
to eat human flesh <â¢ with the relish' of
man-eating tigers. They, may have
been driven to this extremity by wars
that have destroyed their plantations,
and afterward kept it up from choice.
However that may be. when once the
habit"has been acquired they are like
a chicken-eating dog. even carrying the
practice so far as to eat their '.own
tribe men. The Gombo, Bangalas and
Baundjeau of the lower Mobangi, and
the tract between the Mobangi and the
Mongala are the most pronounced can
nibals. The Bangalas do not eat wom
en, as they have too high a commer
cial value. These people are among
the most cruel of African tribes, and
the most horrible things . take place
among them. They traffic in human
slaves, really to x furnish flesh, and in
the interior they hunt their fellow men
as the animals. most highly prized for
food. One reason for the' preference
for human flesh is said to be its'. slight
salty taste. The elephant's foot is so
salty that there is no need to add any
salt for eating, and human flesh is said
to be the same.
â¢ .â¢â¢-Â¦â¢Â¦â¢
Cannibalism is the greatest incentive
to murder; as is shown by one of the
laws of the X'Sacklaws. which is to the
effect that any man guilty of killing a
free man or conspiring to kill him for
eating purposes, or partaking , of . his
flesh, may be killed hv the relatives of
the murdered man and his flesh sold to
pay damages. There are hundreds of
black traders who carry on the traffic
of buying slaves from one tribe and
taking them to another to sell them as
well-fed stock. 1 have known these un
fortunates to be penned up and fed
like hogs for the market. I once lib
erated three who were fattening for
the Dodo or light of the moon dance,
an all-night festivity which is held in
celebration of the moon's greatest bril
liancy. I could not discover that these
slaves were more miserable than other
men condemned to die :, under civilized
conditions. The fact of being: eaten
does not in itself add new horrors in
their minds. They* are of ten sold and
resold for this purpose, always know-
Ins: their fate, and uncertain how near
or how distant the end may be, yet
they are not in the least overcome by
fear. '
Th thrifty Banzirri at one time
marched a good live fat slave through
the M'Brue's village and sold* him piece
by piece, marking him off with pre
cision as they sold him. The under
standing was that if they "sold enough
or him they would kill him. I was in
a M'Bumu village once when the Bun
zini. brought in a Tockbo slave there
and were selling him piece by piece,
a leg to one person, a thigh to another.
I asked them if they had< him all sold;
they said, "Nearly." ' When I offered
to buy him outright they told me they
made much more selling him piecemeal
than in the bulk. This is the native,
way of trading. .]Â£ a native has ' a
burhel of peanuts he will sell you only
a ouart or two at a time. : Sometiiivjij
several , ten of a tribe will band to
gether, steal a free man or a slave and
sell him to a tribe""! far away. ; What
becomes, of the unfortunate Is a blank.
After, a time, perhaps,* it leaks out and
the culprits are punished.

NEUTRALITY IN WAR.
THi". proclamation of neutrality issued by President
Roosevelt sets forth very fully the rights and limi
tations of neutrals in the present war between
Japan and Russia. According to the principles stated,
contraband articles may be sold in the United States to
either of the belligerents, including arms and ammuni
tion, btu thereafter they arc at shipper's risk. If found
on a neutral merchantman, they may be seized, but the
neutral flag protects the ship, which may not be taken as
?. prize. On the other hand, each belligerent may, of
course, take as a prize the ship of the ether, whether it
contain contraband or not.
i'hc warships of Japan and Russia may make the neu
tral ports of this country, but may not be permitted to
repair, increase their armament, or otherwise augment
their lighting resources, and may take on only sufficient
coal to carry them to their nearest home port, nor may
they sail in chase of any ship of the enemy until twenty
four hours after it has left port, nor may they fight nor
take prizes within the three mile limit of our coast. As
to what is contraband ot war there should be no mistake.
Foodstuffs consigned to a besieged place arc contraband.
Otherwise they are not. Hftrses and mules are not con
traband consigned to a neutral port under a neutral flag.
As San Francisco is the leading port of the United
States, resorted to by both belligerents, it is important
that our merchants and shippers should know that all
contraband may be sold here, but the seller should avoid
assuming the risk of delivery. That belongs to the
buyer.
Warships for either of the belligerents may be built,
but must not be armed in an American shipyard, as that
would be a violation of neutrality. If the war is pro
longed the text of the proclamation will be of continuing
interest. It conforms to the law of nations, and is in
Hne with our treaties with both the belligerent parties.
The greatest need of Russia will be for coal. Hereto
fore her supply has been drawn from Japan, but of
course that is now cut off. The next nearest source is
our Pacific Coast, British Columbia and Australia. But
she cannot draw on these. >ler sale of Alaska may now
be regretted, because the abundant coal there, which was
not known to exist when we acquired the Territory,
would now be a very available and necessary means of
supply.
It is coal that fights at sea, and the present war will
emphasize the ab/olute need of coaling stations in all the
seas, in order to make any navy effective. If one nation
controlled the coal. of the world it would control the
maritime nations absolutely. Our own Government has
not been unmindful of this fact. It is so important in
w:ir that the acquisition of coaling facilities near our
coasts by a nation with which we may be at war is to
be prevented if possible. It is this that invests with so
much importance the ownership of the Danish West In
die*, li acquired by Germany, or if that power took
coaling privileges there, it would be as much a violation
of the Monroe doctrine as would be the acquisition by
that empire j/f territorial dominion in this hemisphere.
In case of prolonged war it may be expected that Rus
sia, will make every effort to get coal from this coast. At
the la?c report Russia's domestic coal production we;
12.862,0.^3 tons, against 230,838.973 tons by the United
Slates. Japan produced 5,647,751 tons. As a coal pro
ducer, the United States leads the world, England being
second. When the military as well as the industrial
capacity of a country is considered, iron and coal are the
chief factors. The United States leads in both. Russia's
iron product was only 4,000.000 tons, against our 25,000,
00. These things show the importance of our position
in case of war between other countries. We have what
they need in foodstuffs, iron and coal, and are sure to be
resorted to tor non-contraband as well as contraband
supplies.
There are conflicting reports of the condition of Rus
sia's war chest. But whether it be good or bad, it is evi
dent that Japan has made the more careful and elaborate
preparations for war, in armament, food and powder, and
has her own coal. This being the case, the naval supre
macy of Japan, if it be established, will increase the risk
taken by Russia in getting supplies from this country,
since, to reach Port Arthur or Vladivostok, the ships
that carry them must enter Japanese waters. ' Sheer
necessity will force Russia to take risks, but American
sellers should confine themselves to getting money for
the goods.
The interesting question is. Did Joseph Chamberlain
say to Campbcll-Bannerman before the Boer war that
the British Government was only bluffing and that the
invasion of British troops into South Africa was to be
simply a dress parade? The British Commons may pon
der on this controversy over dead issues, but the world
will insist that if Chamberlain didn't make the remark
candor should have prompted him to do so.
PULL TOGETHER.
THE city ofiiccrs and citizens of Oakland have En
joyed an excursion to Southern California, and all
come back crying, "Pujl together.'' That is good,
and it is good, too. for every man to pull his best separ
ately for his town and locality, for in the end that means
that all are pulling to the jame purpose.
Los Angeles and Southern California have been singu
larly fortunate and skillful in advertising to catch the
Eastern eye. Go where you will in the East, you are
confronted by the results of this advertising genius. It
is done by individuals, by firms, by organizations and by
municipal governments. As a winter resort Southern
California has fought Florida to a standstill. "A winter
scene in Southern California" is the legend over photo
graphs of all sizes, colored and unco^red, and in every
one the palm and bamboo appear, with banks of rose
vines and fuchsias, to impress the shivering Eastern vic
tim of wintry blasts with the clemency of our climate.
Tt goes without saying that if a winter month picture
of a Southern California scene had no trees in it but the
leaflets elm, sycamore and other deciduous trees it
wonM attract no attention at all. As a start at pulling
together, we advise Oakland and all cities in this section
of the State to pull up their deciduous trees on the
streets and pvt in date and fan palms. These grow so
quickly that Oakland may soon show winter scenes
equal to any in the south, and so do a good stroke of
business for herself and heJo all Northern California.
The degree of individuality that has seemed to antag
onize community of action in some parts of the State has
its oiiginjn the excessive independence of Californians.
an admirable trait in itself, but needful of some disci
pline when the interests of community lite are consid
ered. If all of that individual independence can be
transformed into a common public spirit, there â¢will be
presented ideal conditions of progress. That is what has
been done in Southern California, where fortune and
misfortune are met with high courage and undaunted
hope, until the spirit of the people has become incapable
of surrender to anything, but moves forward, conquering
all. When the same causes arc combined everywhere in
the State, our progress will be invincible, and its results
will astonish the world, for here is the land that will fuse
all civilization into a new development, the richest and
the highest that has been seen.
The Mint of San Francisco is bustling with nervous
activity under the command of Washington for the im
mediate coinage of forty million dollars in twenty
dojiar gold piece?. When Uncle Sam decides to make
money there is nothing small about his orders. Let
us hope that the people of the country will need the
coin and be able to use it for purposes of legitimate ex
change.
THE MOUNTAIN WATER SUPPLY.
IT is proper to explain the position of some of the
members of Congress from this State in regard to
the bill granting to San Francisco the right to turn
the Hetch Hetchy Valjey into a reservoir and to use Lake
Eleanor for the same purpose. The water which has its
source in the snow and glacier of Mount Lyell drains into
the valley by the channel of the Tuolunine River. It is
the dependence of the valley people for irrigation. From
the inception of the plan to resort to that source for a
potable supply for coast cities the valley has looked
upon it with suspicion and aversion.
Under the irrigation district system enormous sums
have been expended to divert that water and apply it to
the support of orchards, vineyards and crops in the in
terior. The members of Congress representing the dis
tricts involved would be derelict in their duty to their
immediate constituency if they did not reflect this feeling
of uneasiness. Quite naturally the valley irrigators do
not wish to share their water with these cities when a
Sufficient supply for potable uses is in sight elsewhere.
The question of division and diversion of water is always
to be of vital interest throughout this part of the conti
nent, where industries related to the soil must largely,
and in places entirely, depend upon irrigation.
A United States Senator from Utah has introduced n
bill providing that the Federal Government shall divert
the water of Snake River in Idaho, above St. Anthony,
carry it out of the State and discharge it into Bear River
in Utah for the purpose of raising the level of Salt Lake.
As a matter of engineering the plan is feasible, but it
would probably make barren the valley of the Snake,
which is now extensively irrigated by canal diversion of
the water of that river. The level of Salt Lake has de
clined because in Wyoming and Utah the water of Bear
River and of the Weber, Ogden and Jordan rivers, all
discharging in the lake, has been diverted for irrigation.
The proposition is simply to uÂ«c the natural tributaries
of the lake to irrigate their own lands and keep the lake
from drying up by depriving the lands of Idaho of the
means of irrigation. This project, like that of the Hetch
Hctcli}- and Lake Eleanor, begins with the proposition to
use only the storm water?. But irrigation in both cases
will soon call for the usÂ« of the storm waters in order
to extend the arable area and make homes for the people.
It will be seen that in both cases there is an acute divi
sion and conflict of interest?, and the parties to each side
of the issue may be expected to be alert from the begin
ning and to fight the ground inch by inch.
Invocation of Federal authority in each case by no
means concludes the matter, as the resources of pre

THE meetings and discussions of the State Confer
ence of Charities this year arc likely to attract a
great deal of attention by reason of the importance
of the issues involved. Locally the work of the Associa
atcd Charities of San Francisco covers a wide field of
usefulness and is becoming thoroughly organized.
The work of this society in aiding and reclaiming de
pendent children, in keeping established the Juvenile
Court for youthful offenders, and, in conjunction with
the Merchants' Association, in examining and indorsing
all deserving charitable institutions, is of great and mani
fest value to the whole community, as well as to so many
of its individual members.
On the list of speakers and writers who wiil appear at
the conference meetings are Dr. Smith of St. Paul and
Judge Lindsey of Denver, besides many of our own citi
zens of prominence and ability. Dr. Smith and Judge
Lindsey have acquired national reputations for the work
they have accomplished and arc noted as unusually
forcible and eloquent speakers.
To illustrate the importance of the work of reclaim
ing young offenders and criminals, Judge Lindsey has
recently pointed out that there arc from three to five
times as many children in proportion to population ar
rested in our large cities each year as there arc adults.
Seventeen thousand under t6 years of age were arrested
in Chicago alone the year before the Juvenile Court law
went into effect and did so much to improve conditions.
Judge Lindsey has ascertained that in most cities one
out of every five mothers' sons finds his way to jail be
tween the tenth and sixteenth years. Such figures are
appalling, and lend the greatest interest and importance
to the work of the Juvenile Court system and the results
it has already accomplished.
Turkey believes that while the powers of Europe arc
busying their meddlesome brains trying to dodge things
in the Orient the time is opportune for her to chastise
Bulgaria and restore Macedonia to its sense of pro
vincial obedience. While the Sick Man of the East may
be wrong in his belief, the rest of us won't object if he
tries a little discipline in the Balkan>. They certainly
need it, and if he can't administer it the lesson may do
him some good.
The perennial question of the proper sanitation ot
Chinatown is again agitating the faculties of the Board
of Supervisors and of the Board of Health. The con
clusion of the affair will be the customary demand upon
the municipal 'treasury for more money* How many
sins of official extravagance are hidden behind the
hideous figure of our Chinese quarter?

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPIC OF THE
TIMES
Pitied the Insane.
"Would you please tell me. sir,"
she said. as she stopped the steward of
the Emergency Hospital as he "was
going through the corridor in the in
sane ward, "where I can find the doc
tors? " - She was a very fine looking
woman, dressed in an up-to-date
manner and having about her evi
dences that the world had gone well
with, her.
/Â¦ "Certainly/: said the steward. "They
â¢will be here at 11:30. It's now
about 11. Just take a seat and wait
a few minutes."
The woman took th*Â» seat In the
matron's room pointed out by the
steward. For several "minutes she re
mained there and then got up and
began walking about the place. The
steward advised, her to keep away ,
from a certain cell for fear that she
might, by peering into it, excite the
occupant, a particularly vicious spec
imen of mental weakness. "Thank
you," courteously said the Â¦woman.
"I'll be very careful. You know I 1
am interested in insane people. That .
Is what I want to see the doctors ;
about. . Poor things, I pity them so.
I will do so .much for them when I
return to "Washington. I am Mrs.
Roosevelt."
When the doctors came they per
suaded the poor woman that she
would be able to do a great deal for
the insane if she Â¦would go to an asy
lum and make a study of them for ,
several months. She readily consent
ed and they sent her to Agnews. I
The Wise Ones.
A proprietor of one of the largest
dry g-oods houses in Oakland was asked
if he did much business, being situ
ated as he was so close to San Fran
cisco. "Yes. we do a large business,"
said he. "You examine the receipts of
this firm for a day and compare them
with a house of equal size in the city
and you will be surprised to find that
we do as big a business as they da.
"How do I account for it? Well, I'll
tell you," said the proprietor. "You
see women are very sensitive about
the price of their clothes. Their main
aim is to get something that no one
can duplicate or even know the price of.
'iFor that reason we do an extensive
business with the women of San Fran
cisco. Every day they come over by
the score to purchase their goods and
feel safe when they go to a party or
ball that no other woman will know
how much their gown cost. They stand
less danger of seeing a duplicate of
their goods made into a social rivals'
dress. At least that's what they think,
and it is their way of figuring that is
our salvation. Of ccurse. they never
know that the bulk of the goods we
sell them is purchased right in the
wholesale houses of San Francisco.
But what they don't know will never
hurt them, as the old adage goes."
The "Beefsteak Club:'
[ The recent untimely death of John
i Reia brings to mind a harmless but
! amusing trick that he and two of his
i friends in the Bohemian Club played
; upon some of their fellow club mem
b rs. The three organized the "Beef
steak <'lub." and then began opera
tions. Their plan was to approach a
new and wealthy member, tell him of
the exclusive organization to which
they belonged and invite him to be
come a member upon payment of the
initiation fee. which was a beefsteak
dinner at the Bohemian Club for all
the "Beefsteaker^,'" followed by an
eveaing in a box at one of the thea
ters. The wealthy man usually ac
cepted the invitation and enjoyed the
affair so thoroughly that he assisted
in getting the next member of the
"Beefsteak Club." who would pay the
same sort of initiation. Then the three
original members would call a meet
ing. exDel "the new members and be
gin operations anew.
Reorganized Department.
After being installed in his new po
sition Secretary Taft's first official act
was to summon the War Department
carpenter and tell him to make a new
desk and chair, and be quick about it.
Secretary Taft is 6 feet tall and
weights 320 pounds. He found he could
barely squeeze into the chair used by
Mr. Root. He could not sit comfort
ably in it. and there was great danger
that the chair would go to pieces un
der him if he moved quickly.
When he tried to get up to the desk
he discovered that the opening was
neither wide enough nor high enough
to admit his legs. The best he could do
was to pull out one of the small leaves
of the desk and try to write on that.
The desk and the chair that will be
built far the new Secretary will be of
mammoth proportions. The chair will
be very strong and will be braced with
iron at every joint.
It is probable that a special chair will
have to be provided for Secretary Taft
in the Cabinet room at the White
House. The Cabinet chairs are very
large, as ordinary sizes go, but they
are a tight fit for Mr. Taft.
Frightful Heat.
'Humanity, which swelters in a heat
of 90 degrees and withers anddies^if
the mercury runs up 10 or 13 degrees
higher;. finds it hard. to realize a heat
of 5400 .degrees. Yet that is the heat
developed in the combustion of. ther

â¢stont Cubans.
Cubans are dividing upon religious
lines,, and it is predicted, by expert
observers just returned from there that
within a few years conditions there will
be almost precisely as they are here.
It 'Is stated that the element that
backed the revolution and did most to
throw off Spanish rule is reaching: out
toward the Episcopal church, and vol
unteering to assist it to erect in Ha
vana a cathedral church that shall, for
the non-Roman population, take the
place of the new Christ Church Cathe
dral recently erected for the* Roman
Catholics. The latter was put up with
money which the church obtained from
the sale of properties to the United
States Government, supplemented by
local gifts, and in It services precisely"
like those maintained in America are
carried on, the young ami popular
Bishop Broderick officiating most of the
time. The Masonic element, which is
very strong in Cuba, is offering tt*
work along Protestant lines. Presby
terians, Congregationalists, Baptists
and the Young Men's Christian Asso
elation are getting firm footholds an<l
attracting t elements similar to those
attracted in the United States. Bit

are said to be working in harmony to
the end that bitterness shall not be
shown.

MAIIOXY INDICTMENT
MAY Hi: DISMISSED
Judtre Cook Intimates hs Much, but
Reserves Rendering of Formal
Decision for a Week.
Judge Cook has postponed his de
rision for a week on the motion of
Attorney George D. Collins on behalf
of A. B. Mahony, ex-County Clerk, to
set at-ide the indictment charging Ma
hony with presenting a false and
fraudulent claim for allowance to the
Auditor.
When the case wag called yesterday
the Judge said he had carefully ex
amined the authorities submitted, but
could not find any special demurrer on
the point raised, that the indictment
must do more than foyow the lan
guage of the statute. It seemed, how
ever, that in later cases the general
rule that the indictment need only
follow the language of the statute
had exceptions.
In the case decided by the Supreme
Court last month there was little
question but that the pleading was in
sufficient, but the Judgment had not
become final, as a petition had been
filed for a rehearing. He would there
fore prefer to postpone his decision
on the motion till there was a final
Judgment in the case referred to by
the Supreme Court. The matter was
continued till next Saturday.
Alleged Counterfeiter Caught.
Another alleged counterfeiter has
fallen into the clutches of United
States Secret Service Detective George
W. Hazen. His name is Eric Blade,
and he was caught at Truckee. where
he had been disposing of counterfeit
quarter dollar pieces by playing them
in the slot machines, which yielded up
good money for bad â sometimes. The
arrest was made by Constable
Schlumpf, who found ten of the bad
quarters in Blade's pockets. A Dep
uty United States Marshal was sent
up after Blade yesterday.

Willis O. Huson and Rose Stolker,
who in July of last year purchased,
from Charles P. Wilson and his wife
Frances a two-sixteenths interest in the
Claxton mining claim in Calaveras
County for $900, sued the Wilsons yes
terday for $1500 damages. They claim
that th<> defendants falsely represented

able ono and induced them to buy it.
They spent $600 prospecting it, they

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1904
CAPTAIN BALLINGER GOES
BEFORE POLICE TRIBUNAL
Judge Cabaniss Hears Testimony Regarding Re
ported Peculations of Former Soldierâ Alleged
Ohinese Perjurer, as Usual, Escapes Conviction |
Captain George T. Baliinger, who ,
I commanded Company A of the fighting
First Regiment of California Volun
teers dhring Its arduous and sucoeas- i
ful campaign In the Philippines, was In
Judge Cabanlss' court yesterday on a
felony embezzlement charge.
He is accused of embezzling $4376
from the California Art Glass Work*,
where for many years he was a trusted
bookkeeper and cashier. At the out
break of the Spanish war Balllnger :
was a second lieutenant in the State ;
militia. His employers gave him per- |
mission to go to the Philippines with |
his regiment, and he covered himself
with glory, returning as a captain. Dur
ing his wartime career his employers,
at the suggestion of William Schroeder,
the president of the glass works, con- i
tinued his galary at the same rate as if
he had been performing his accustomed
duties.
When Ballinger returned to this city
he was given his old position, and his
employers trusted him so Implicitly
that they never had his books exam
ined. Reports of extravagant expendi
tures finally awakened their suspicions,
and when an expert accountant was j
called in it was found that Ballinger
called in it was found, it is claimed, ,
that Ballinger was short in his ac- I
counts.
Ballinger says he is in business, and
yesterday through his attorney, Walter
Gallagher, insisted on a speedy hear
ing. He claims he is innocent of wrong
doing and can prove his assertion. At {
present he is at liberty on bail. He says
that he has started a business in oppo- j
sition to the Art Glass Company, and }
resentment at this caused his arrest.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Huey Guey. a name that sounds like ]
rice too much boiled in a Chinese res- I
taurant, was dismissed on a charge of |
perjury yesterday by Judge Mogan. He
happened along, as most Chinese wit
nesses do, in a case of grand larceny '
preferred against Ju Lim. Huey Guey ,
was willing to testify that he saw the !
larceny committed. A gold and ebony i
bracelet was the matter in question.
When the charge of grand larceny \
was preferred in Judge Lawlor's court '
Huey Guey was ordered into custody j
for perjury, because his testimony was
evidently manufactured to suit the oc
casion. As a matter of fact, Ju Lim |
-vvas innocent of the theft and was;
brought back from San Jose merely to j
be a mark for the highbinders.
The failure of corroborating wit- |
nesses was accountable for the di - j
missal of Huey Guey. The reporter j
of the court had only the testimony |
of the Chinese interpreter to tell that |
his notes were correct and the inter
preter. could not remember the dia- j
logue he had carried on between wit- j
ness and the court during the hearing.
It might be well to secure a Chinese
interpreter who can find a memory
when needed.

Ben Michaels, who is accused of
trying to take a Washington farmer j
down the line to the extent of $l. r >oo, 1
w.is before Judge Conlan yesterday. ,
Previously the defendant had been ]
dismissed by Judge Fritz for lack of j
proof.
The complaining witness is Wade
W. Conenhaven, who wished to for
sakÂ« the grain country of the far j
north for the glitter and light of a i
theatrical life. Michaels promised to j
show him and did so. Copenhaven j
v, jinted to be shown.
Tiicre was a shadowy apparition
named Stanton that collected two rolls,
of grt-enbaeks from the two men on"
Â¦ the belief that he had a theater for
i disposal. Michaels claims to have
given Stanton $1500 in money of the
United States and says he was victim
ized to that amount. Copenhaven
' pave a like amount to Stanton and has
I since been shy the money. Stanton
has been an uncatchable butterfly as
far -as the police are concerned and
has winged his way afar with the
$3000 tucked snugly under his wing.
Mil hael3 may or may not be guilty
of complicity in the theft of $1500
from Copenhaven, but the police
think he is guilty, and after he was
dismissed by Judge Fritz another war
rant was sworn out and the case was
transferred to Judge Cabaniss' court.
The hearing was continued until Sat
urday.

B. A. Galvin is not such a fighter

Micklen and Esther WasÂ«ercrook
jumped him and almost won the
fight. Galvin managed to get the de
cision, however, but a policeman came
along: and took him Into custody.
He was convicted in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday- on a charge .of bat
tery, mainly because he sent, a soup
dish sailing into a : woman's face. His
sentence will come off Monday. '/^ ' -

Peter Albert was sentenced to six
months in Oakland by Judge Fritz
yesterday. Bailiff , Conlan pleaded
hard for clemency, but the Judge
v.-as obdurate. "Go over there and
taste the mercy of Judge Quinn," said
the magistrate. : . "Perhaps he will
straighten you up. , Never let me see
your face again." /
The prisoner, who recently left the
County Hospital and was celebrating
his recovery, wept heavily at the sen
tence, but the Judge refused to remit
any part of it. '

William Hansche is ;a. prowler of

ried his first wife while drunk. The
second little sirl is clinging to him
like an ivy to a board house. Some
Superior Court will have to adjudicate
the case, but if it were left in Judge
Fritz's hands Jackson would certainly

Mary Wall came out from the
County Jail only last/Ihursday. When
she arrived in the haunts of pleasure,
which to her mean some saloons on
Howard street, blocked by Third and
Fourth, she tame to her own again.
It was a wild night from her stand
point and a policeman was obliged to
take her into custody to preserve the
peace and dignity of the neighbor
hood. |
Her story of former incarceration
wrought upon the sympathies of i
Judge Fritz and he allowed her to go
with a twenty-four-hour sentence in
the City Prison and a warning that
any culminative excesses in her line
would be viewed with extreme dis
pleasure by the court and a corre
sponding penalty imposed.
Decline to Hear Witnesses.
The Police Commissioners met yes
terday afternoon and listened to a re
quest made by Attorneys Barrett, Dib
ble and Carpenter, representing the
Chinese Consul, that the board should
hear the testimony of witnesses they
desire to produce to refute the testi
mony given by Policemen Brodt and
Kramer and others regarding the ar
rest and subsequent suicide of Tom
Kirn Yung, military attache at Wash
ington of the Chinese legation last
September. The board held that they
had no authority to hear any more
witnesses, as they had closed their
case, but the attorneys were at liberty
to cross-examine their witnesses,
which was declined.

SIGNS BILL REPEALING
BLASTING PRIVILEGE
j Mayor Affixes His Signature to Reso
lution Preventing Gray Bros. From
Operating Their Quarry.
Mayor Schmitz yesterday affixed his
I signature to the resolution adopted by
j the Board of Supervisors repealing a
former permit granted to the San
Francisco Brick Company to explode
blasts on block 14 of the Castro-street
Addition.
The measure will prevent Gray Bros.,
who compose the company, from carry
ing on rock crushing operations on the
block named. Two other ordinances
extending the limits within which
blasting is prohibited have been passed
to print and will come up for final pas
sage at to-morrow's meeting.
The limits will Include the block upon
which Gray Bros, intended to operate.
In the opinion of some of the Super-
I visors, the original permit granted to
the firm is of no effect because it did
not file a bond in that connection in
j accordance with a general ordinance
' regulating blasting.

Distributes Carto Estate.
An order distributing the estate of

j Court before a jury. The Jury dis-
I agreed.

'sAX JOSE, Feb. 13.â Five young
Englishmen -who came to California to
learn farming are mourning the loss
of $3730 and the disappearance of H.
C. Barber, their tutor, from Mountain
View. Last summer Barber rented the
Hale ranch in the foothills a few miles
from Mountain Viev.\ He then made
a trip to England and advertised for
a number of young: Englishmen to ac
company him to California and learn
farming and stock raising. Five mem
bers of well-to-do families were ap
prenticed to Barber, who was paid $750
for each apprentice. They accompanied
Barber to his ranch near Mountain
View. After getting his pupils housed
at the ranch Barber went to San Fran
cisco on the Dlea of business and told
them he wouid not be back for a couple
of weeks. This was two moViths ago,
and he has not been seen since.
It is believed Barber took a steamer
for Japan or China. His disappearance
is causing much talk among the busi
ness men of Mountain View. The
young Englishmen are about to return
home.

I Passenacr-Laden Vessel Tees
Piles Up at Trial Island,
but Xo Li\es Are Lost
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Feb. 13. â In clear,
starry weather, with no wind and a
quiet sea, the Canadian Pacific Navi
gation Company's steamer Tees, about
1500 tons burden, from Port Simpson
to Victoria, ran on the reef off Trial
Island, six miles from the harbor
mouth, this morning about 2 o'clock
and may become a total loss.
The steamer was in charge of Sec
ond Officer Roberts, her commander,
Captain Hughes, being below, ill with
pneumonia. The Tees was bound for
the quarantine sttffton, having had to
put off A. Thompson, a man supposed
to be suffering from smallpox.
The thirty passengers are now quar
antined and the officers and crew have
I boon ordered to stay aboard pending
j the decision of the Port Simpson doc
j tor as to the nature of the disease.'
This news is expected by the Amur
Sunday. All attempts to pull off the
Teos have failed. Another frial is to
take place to-morrow morning at 3
o'clock, when there will be high tide.
She is safe from all winds but from
east and southeast and if they rise
she is doomed.
Captain Hughes has had more than
thirty years' experience as a navigator
and this is his first mishap. The Tees
is insured. An inquiry Into all the
circumstances will be held.

SNOW BLOCKADE
BROUGHT TO END
Trains Delayed at Truckee
Are Released and Commence
Running to Their Terminus
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 13.â The snow
blockade on the railroad between this
city and TFuckee Has been raised- Five
delayed trains passed through this city
-an Francisco to-night, the first
reaching this point at 6:20 and the fifth
going through at 8:30.
Division Superintendent Laws is at
Truckcc with an army of workmen,
who are engaged in completing the res- !
tors t ion of the track to normal condi
tion?. Several long reaches of track
v cro carried away and a tc'mporary
track has boon laid, over _which the
delayed trains crept.
Permanent repairs will be made at
once. Â¦ The weather is growing colder
and no further danger to- the tra<-k
and snow sheds Is feared. The work
of clearing the track was accomplished
i in half the time estimated.
This was accomplished by the ability
of tne company to get a large num
ber of men on the ground soon '#fter
the collapse of the snow sheds and at
tacking the slides of snow and earth
at a dozen points simultaneously.
MANAGER AGLER RETURNS.
Delayed Passengers Reach This City
on the Overland Trains.
Manager James Agler of the South
ern Pacific Company, who has been out
on the road for several days directing
the work of raising the snow blockade,
returned to the city yesterday.
He announced that all trains over
the Ogden route are now moving and
that the more serious trouble expe
rienced in the Sierras had put-sed.
The first of the blockaded overland
trains arrived in this city yesterday
forenoon. They were the limited trains,
which were sent ahead of the regular
overlands. The latter arrived last even
ing, the first at 10:20 am. two others
shortly after midnight.
The passengers had little complaint
to make, fully appreciating the fact
that the railroad company had done
everything possible to bring them
through to their destination and had
had them well cared for during their
thirty-two hours' tie-up at Truekee.
The only great inconvenience the pas
sengers experienced during the ci< lay
was the want of gas, the suoply In the
car tanks having been exhausted, but
a substitute light was finally furnished
in the shape of candles.

PRINCESS WEDS AGAINST
WISHES OF HER FAMILY
Daughter of Reigning House in Prin
cipality of Reuss-Greit/. Chooses
Soldier for Her Husband.
BERLIN, Feb. 13.â Greiz. the capi
tal of the principality of Reuss-Greitx,
whs i c scene last Monday of another
of those royal romances which have
been plentiful on the Continent in re
cent years. Some time ago the Prin
cess Emma, the oldest daughter of the
ancient and wealthy house of lieus?,
f^il in love with Count Keunigl. an
Austrian. With difficulty the objec
tions of the family were overcome and
she married him. At the wedding her
younger sister, the Princess Marie, fell
in love with a fascinating Austrian sol
dier, the Baron Guagnoni. She, too,
overcame opposition of her relatives,
who were infinitely distressed that the
second Princess of a reigning house,
which ranks on an equality with all
royal families in Europe, should marry
a simple Baron, cspe.-ially as in this
case the bridegroom v.mÂ« a Catholic
and the Princes* a Protestant. The
wedding took place privately in the
royal castle on Monday.

AT HANNA'S
SICKROOM
Nation's Chief- Executive Is
Among the Anxious Persons
Who Call on the Family
â¢I the Suffering senator
IMPROVEMENT NOTED,
BIT FEAR PREVAILS
Patient Is Able to Take and
Retain Some Nourishment
and the Possible Complica
tions May Still Be Prevented
WASHINGTON. Feb. 13. â Despite
the critical condition of Senator Han
na, the feeling of despondency which
last night pervaded the sick chamber
gave way to-night to one of restored
hope. AH during the day the attend
ing- phyEicaua, noting the manner in
which the patient responded to treat
ment, gave it as their belief that he
had a "fighting chance."
The tension under which the imme
diate members of the family have
been since 3 o'clock yesterday after
noon, when the sinking spell came on,
was notably relieved to-day and the
Senator's brother, his son, Dan, and
others of the household spent some
Time in the lobby of the hotel. Indeed,
his condition -was such this afternoon
â¢hat Mrs. Hanna was able to take a
short drive.
When morning broke Senator Hahna
asd held his own during the night,
although it had been necessary to keep
dorm the temperature, which at one
time reached 10?. by frequent sponge
baths. The .Senator has been con
scious most of the time, but has been
too ' ak to rouse himself except -at
very, infrequent, intervals and then he
< ould make himself ' entirely under
stood, -ij
DOCTORS ARE VIGILANT. |
The most sratifyinjj feature of the
' ase is the Senator's continued ability
to take and retain nourishment. This
i onsists of small- quantities of milk and
\yhisky. Throughout the day the ut
â¢ttiost watchfulness was observed to
prevent if possible, a recurrence of the
< !i;ll which yesterday came so near re
.'v Sting falally. Saline, injections and
oxygen, were resorted to when in the
opinion of the physicians there v.-as
_ the slightest indication of a setback.
An important point was ! settled to
night when the announcement was
ma.de that the Senator's illnes was un- i
accompanied by any complications.
The patient fully realizes the gravity
of his condition. At one time when
he was able to feebly converse with
his physicians the Senator said he
would lend all his aid to their efforts
:n his behalf.
All day long a constant stream of
callers made their way to the Arling
ton to inquire regarding the Senator's
condition. President Roosevelt was
one of these, and upon arrival at the
hotel he was at -once shown into the
family apartments, where he con
versed for ten minutes with Mrs. Han
na and received from her the latest
-formation as to Mr. Hanna's condi
tion.
ROOSEVELT AT HOTEL.
Before going upstairs the Pre;
informed that Mr. BUnt'i tem
rerature at that time was tow*
indition a little better, and he

On coming from the sickroom after
the issuance of the 11 o'clock bulletin,
Mr. Dover said the physicians would
Â¦ ply to direct questions regarding
Â¦he prospects of the Senator V recov
, *y. They feel, however, said Mr. D,o
Â¦ er, that he not only has held his own,
C anything, has gained. This im
j roved condition, the physicians say,
:â¢ due to the nourishment given the
patient, the use of less oxygen, a re
<!uctJon in the strength of the stimu
lant and the natural sleep he secured.
M'hen Dr. Rixey arrived to-night Dr.
< <j<ler said the Senator had had a good

improved.

"SAN FRANCISCO, ! /'SUNDAY. FEBRUARY- 14, 1904.
EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR OF COLONIAL CLUB, SHOWING HOW THE BOBBERS ENTERED AND DID THKIK WORK.
Officers of the Colonial Club, whose
quarters at 133 Powell street were en
tered and robbed by five masked men
early yesterday morning, say they have
a clew to the identity of the robbers
and have communicated their knowl
edge to the .police. They expect ar
rests to be made immediately, they
say, and if action in that direction is
not taken to-day, they will make public
the names of the men they suspect.
"We have a clew," said Joseph
Schreiber, secretary of the club, last
night, "and we have given it to the
police. If arrests are not made within
a reasonable time we will give the
name* of the suspects to the public.
The men who committed the robbery
are *till in the city. They are not
regular members of the Colonial Club,
but have visited our rooms several
times as guests of members. They be
came thoroughly familiar with the
place, and knew exactly how and
where to find the cash."
It was reported yesterday that
Schreiber and his associates were en
deavoring to "square" the robbers and
regain the stolen money and diamonds
without police assistance, but last
night the secretary indignantly pro
nounced the report groundless.
"We are determined to push the ar
rest of the thieves," he said, "and will
'go the limit' of expenditure to secure
their conviction. It is up to the police
to make the arrests. We have given
the clew."
MO ARRESTS ARE MADE.
Four of the city's shrewdest detec
tives spent much of yesterday in os
tensible quest of a clew to the identity
of the men who robbed the Colonial
â¢ 'lub, and got away with about $10,000
in cash and diamonds. But twenty
four hours after the robbery no person
had been formally arrested as a result
of the crime, and if the detectives had
any suspicions they declined to divulge
them.
The only thing approaching a clew
was obtained from the story told by
Charles B. Heath, one of the eight men
who were in the card room when the
four masked robbers invaded it. Heath
said he recognized one of the desper
adoes as an eighteen-year-old boy he
Jad seen frequently at the race track
and heard addressed as "Kid." This
story | was told '. while* : Heath * himself
was under J suspicion, ' for :he â¢ was ' the
only one of the i octet whom the \ rob
bers did not" 'search -if or valuables. He
returned, from Alaska several months
.ago with considerable money, but soon
gambled >itt away on race horses, and
has since , been '. notoriously. impecu;
nious. When the '; thieves began. to ex
plore the pockets of their V victims,''
Heath ? laughingly said, "Boys. I'm a
lobster." and A one of the fellows re
marked to ; his companions. ; ; "That's
right: he's a dead, one." So in the' ex
ploration he was ignored. ' ,
-; " A MYSTERIOUS "KID." ' >"j
.When the {detectives - learned of this
they at once sized up the incident as
suspicious, : and Heath was ; : subjected
to severe interrogation. . He sturdily
maintained that 'all' he knew concern
ing the robbery wan what occurred in;
the room and that "Kid" was the only,
one | of the I marauders [ lie [ recognized.
So they took ; him to the rogues' gal
lery, ; and ? among â the pictures : shown
him he picked out one as' bearing re
semblance to â¢ "Kid." 1 Then a search
for the original of the photograph was
apparently commenced.' and up to the Â¦
time this; paper went \ to" Â¦; press '; i t Â» had
been fruitless. , ... . .-,. , . . \: } '
':",Â¦ Heath .'"as .not; placed under arrest
or detail? a in- -way and he spent
the afternoon at the races. sHe did
not eulogize: .the %' police "'..'shrewdness,
that . accepted his freedom I from mo- â¢
lestation fat the *'- hands of the , robbers
indicative of his ; complicity in their
job. v It would be more logical, he ar
gues, , to assume that if he was an ac
complice he would have been the first
man overhauled in order to avert sus
picion, of his "complicity. - ' â¢../.-". ;
';Â¦. That the robbers knew every- man
in the room and his pecuniary condi
tion v was made ;# manifest.' â¢.- by their
movements. ; Their knowledge of that
"and other things ; indicates \ that - they
are racetrack* followers, for the Co
lonial Club habitues are * horsemen.
. ']'./. -.WELL; EXECUTED JOB. ':-.' . !
â¢;_ Never was a robbery more delib
erately planned or more s>-stematically
executed. That the entire perform
ance had been thoroughly thought out
by the thieves was evidenced by its
completeness. Not a hitch marred the j
carrying- out of the prearranged pro
gramme. Each man was letter per
fect and thoroughly rehearsed, in his
part. : There wars no superfluous ac
tion and no words were wasted.
It was also evident that at least one
j of -the masked men: had- studied the
routinV habits of the- club ..managers,
familiarized - himself j with the layout
of the three rooms and acted in ac
cordance with his finding, for there
was no confusion after the grand en
tree was made. While â¢ three of the
marauders attended to the seven men
I surrounding- the card table a fourth
I devoted" his attention exclusively to
Joe Harlan, "Â¦ the * custodian â¢ of the
club's capital, and a fifth remained; in
the hallway to- prevent' any intrusion
upon the dramatic scene being enacted
within- the middle' 'apartment. This
:fifth-marr did. not- make spectacular
display- ' of, himself, Â¦ but stood : well
within the shadow, and Harlan was
the only one of the victims who caught
a glimpse of him. : .: '
- "As my hands went' up ; in .response
; to the " masked man's command,"- said
' Harlan, ,"I .slanced^beyorid; him and
' through the half-open; door saw a fel-
J low Standing in ! the hallway. .. His back

- "Two of- them made a funny bluff
after they left the room," said Jerry
Quill, president of the club. "As I lay
there, helpless. I heard one fellow say:
'Better stay here I half an hour, any
way.' Another voice, said: 'Well, you
stay, with me. then.' The first voice
exclaimed: 'All right: we'll both stay."

About ten minutes before the rob
bery took' place, the Colonial Club was
visited by Policeman Matheson. He
poked his head Into th" room in which
the whist. party was engaged, but did
not enter, and he was: standing across
the street, directly* opposite the club,
while the robbars were at wark inside.
He ! saw the lights disappear, and a
lew minutes afterward, noticed a man'
descend the steps and walk down Pow
ell street. /Thinking* it was one of the
club officials, whr> closed the place for
the night. Matheson made no attempt
to overhaul; the man. __ . .
The description at the four robbers
who entered .the room, as given- to the
detectives Â¦by the 'men who were plun
dered, is as follows :

Ffce rhostnut Son of Hastings
Wins Handily, in Record
Time for the Southern Track
NITRATE IS SECOND
< oiues Witt a Great Burst of
Speei in the Stretch, but
Kails to Get Up in Time
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13.â Oarsman,
the horse that was brought from San
Francisco to win the Ascot handicap,
worth about 53000 to the first horse,
did not disappoint his owner. He won
handily from Nitrate with Haviland
third. The time was 2:07 for the mile
and a quarter, the best ever made over
the Ascot track.
The handicap and five other good
races brought out one of the largest
crowds of the meeting. It was the
record crowd from a speculative point
of view. The twelve books had all
they could do to handle the money that
flowed in on every race. # On the whole,
it was a bad day for the favorites,
although several liberal priced second
choices were successful.
The handicap was fourth on the pro
sxamme and brought out five horses.
Oarsman opened favorite, but as quick
ly as 2 to 1 was put up against Nitrate
there was a rush and the price receded
to 9 to 5 and then to 8 to 5 at the post.
Oarsman opened at evens and went to
S to 5. The big money went in on Ni
trate, but Oarsman was backed by the
regulars. Haviland was not well sup
ported and closed at ' to 2. Grail, at 8
to 1, and Diamante, at 12 to 1, were
nibbled at. There was considerable de
lay In getting the horses off. Grail and
Haviland went to the front at once,
Oarsman third and Nitrate fourth.
They .maintained this order to the
stretch, where TVonderly shook Oars
man up and he went to the front at
once. Nitrate came with a great burst
of speed at the finish, but could not
get up. Haviland got the show.
- Little Margaret, at 6 to L, won the
first rare from Celebration. Geheim
ness, the favorite, was third.
Dick Turpin was a red-hot favorite
for the second, but lost to Bill Curtis,
with Felipe Lugo third.
Emshee was best in the third and
was played into 5 to 2 favoritism at
post time. He won easily from Jingler,
with Phyz third.
Glennevls took, the fifth race from
Gloriosa, the favorite, with Rag Tag
third. The winner was strongly played
at Z bo 1. 9EÂ£s3
Jim Hale surprised the talent by
winning the last race at 5 to 1. Ul

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1904.
CLAUDE, SUPERBLY RIDDEN BY J. DALY,
CAPTURES PALACE HOTEL HANDICAP
Choices Run Well
to Form at
Ingleside.
With a quartet of Derbies to his cred-
J it, besides numerous other minor racing
I fixtures, and holding the honor of fin
ishing third in the rich Burns handicap
of 1903 and runner-up this year -in the
event, M. J. Daly's grand horse Claude
tucked away the Palace Hotel handicap
in his grip as another memento yester
day at Ingleside.
As the track was heavy and all the
i crack mudlarks were down to sport silk
I the race attracted a large Saturday
j crowd. The gross valuation of the
! stake was $3880, of which amount the
I first horse took $3220. Although Claude
â¢ was shouldering the top weight, 123
pounds, his splendid effort in "the
i Burns" was not forgotten, and he went
: to the post a 13 to 5 favorite. Of the
j other twelve starters the Jennings pair,
! Arcade and Nigrette, and the Bender
; stable, Lord Melbourne and O'Hagen,
were the next most fancied. Modicum,
i too, while picking up ten pounds more
j than he carried in the Burns handicap,
was not without friends.
DELAY AT THE POST.
Jockey Club and The Don gave some
i trouble at the post, but after' a short
: delay Jake Holtman released the bar
rier to a splendid start. Past the stand
the first time Modicum, Lord Melbourne
and Claude led the way. Modicum soon
'> found the pace too warm, but Lord
I Melbourne with his 100 pounds kept
: right on, and it looked as if he might
j win.
On the far turn Johnny Daly sat
! down on Claude, and the bay horse re
i sponding had his field beaten to a
standstill as he swung into the stretch.
Johnny Daly was taking no chances,
| however, on a grand stand finish, but
| rode his mount out, finishing two and a
i half lengths in front of Lord Melbourne
; and Kenil worth. The latter horse ran
[ an excellent race at a distance not sup
posed to be to his liking. Arcade ap
peared outclassed and Nigrette was
, never prominent.
Favorites had a good inning, taking
four out of six events. Quiz II and Le
| tola were the disgraced choices. Busi
ness in the ring was thriving, and the
major portion of the pencilers quit
loser.
QUIZ II IS UNPLACED.
Although his race on Friday, when
Charley McCafferty thought his gelding
a certainty, was not a flattering one,
Quiz II was installed favorite over
Brennus for the opening event. Early
in the game Quiz displayed some speed,
i but later faded away and was unplaced.
i Ad nor cut out the pace for a panel or
| two, when Willie See hustled Brennus
to the front, winning cleverly at the
wire from Standard. Polonius ran
i third.
P. Ryan's slashing looking son of
i Order, My Order, a 2 to 5 choice, h;id
! a narrow escape from defeat in the
| two-year-old scramble. When the
i barrier was sprung he was last away
I of the five starters, and it looked all
i off with him. Hildebrand, who rode
the favorite, got through on the rail
turning into the stretch, and by so do
ing gained the lead. .He was in the
worst going, though, but under these
adverse conditions his mount was so
much the best that he beat Bob Ragon
out a head at the end. Edgecliff was
third. George P. McNear, heavily
played for the show, tired at the pad
dock, finishing fourth.
Walter Jennings' fast filly Letola let
the talent down with a terrific bump
by her miserable showing in the six
furlong selling run, captured by
Hainault. She opened a6to 5 chance,
receded to 9 to 5, and after displaying
a flash of speed dropped to the rear.
Hainault, the second choice, with Fo
ley in the saddle, assumed the front
position on the back stretch and
breezed home before Celebrant. Show
honors fell to Fair Lady Anna. I
Know, piloted i>y Roach, showed no
j speed at any stage of it.
Hildebrand scored his second win
ning mount of the afternoon with
Byronerdale in the mile and a quarter
selling affair. For a mile or more Mr.
Dingle proved a troublesome customer,
but through the stretch Byronerdule
had the footing over him, earning the
verdict cleverly in a neck finish.
Chickadee showed some early speed,,
then grew weary and was downed for
the show by Expedient The price
against the winner receded from 6 to
5 to 8 to 5.
A mile and fifty yard run, also de
cided under selling conditions, con
cluded the card, for which Horton
and Bill Massie closed equal favorites
in the ring. Horton, with Jack Mar
tin up, made a disappointing showing,
while Bill Massie, after taking the
lead from Diderot, won cleverly from
Axminster. Horton was third.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Twenty-one books cut in. Frank Lan
terman and Sam Stevens were the ab
sentees.
Hildebrand wiirnot leave here for Los
Angeles until Tuesday night, as Joe
Teager is unable to obtain a car for his
horses until then. Joe will not book at
Los Angeles, but will put in most of his
time at Catalina Island. From Los An
geles he will ship his stable to the new
Kansas City track, and later in the
season will travel on East. Yeager has
been successful the past few days, and
says he will quit loser only about $8000,
which he figures as nothing.
Frank Lanterman will stay for a
couple of weeks longer.
Ed Stutte likes the game and will be
here for a month or so longer. Stutte is
quite a bettor himself.
Charley Henshall ships his stable and
Jockey Kunz to Little Rock to-morrow.
Charley will put in a short season play
ing the chalk at Hot Springs.
Jake Holtman has signed to start at
the Louisville spring meeting. He will
alternate again this year with Dick
Dwyer at Latonia and on the Canadian
circuit.
An average of fourteen railway col
lisions a day is the record in the Uni
ted States last year, as shown by the
report of the Interstate Commerce
Commission.

FOUR BOWLING MATCHES
PLAYED OX PARK GREEN
Hay and Eaton Defeat Lawson and
Eurasian After an Exciting Strug
gle on the Rinks.
Only four matches were played by
the Scottish bowlers yesterday after
noon. The best game was a doubles
between Alexander Hay and W. R.
Eaton and Y. C. Lawson and J. M.
Earsman. The latter were considered
a stronger team than their opponents,
but were beaten, 21 to 17. It was a
close contest and the last few ends de
cided it.
The other matches played were all
one-sided. The closest was that be
tween J. M. Earsman and D. O'Brien.
The former won, 21 to 7. T. G. Aiken
and J. McLaren did some excellent
rolling when they beat such cracks as
J. C. Moffatt, the -club champion, and
H. L. Tickner, 21 to 5. The losers were
beaten by a similar score in their
match with Joseph Gray and G. C.
Patterson. The green was wet and
the absence of most of the crack play
ers was due to this.

TOO MUCH FOR STANFORD
Defeat the Cardinal Nine Handily by
a Score of Eight to
Four.
SANTA CLARA, Feb. 13.â The ball
game to-day between the Stanford
varsity nine and the Santa Clara Col
lege was played upon the Santa Clara
campus, which is sand covered and
quickly dries after rain. There was a
good crowd in attendance, all the
bleachers being filled.
The game jogged along for three In
nings without a run and with few hits.
Chase, all-around man for Santa Clara,
who went from second to first and
then played behind the bat, was the
pitcher in to-day's game and showed
good speed. Chase knocked a
liner clean through the Stanford works
for a home run.
The score was 8 to 4 when the third
Stanford man went out in the first
half of the ninth, with Santa Clara Col
lege on the long side. Batteriesâ Chase
and McKune for Santa Clara College;
Sales, Twitch and Ball for Stanford.

Club on the Eve of All
Fools' Day.
Young Corbett and Jimmy Britt
have again placed their signatures to
a contract in which they agree to meet
in the prize ring on the eve of All

such potent drawing power and then
Jimmy Britt completed the pact by af

in a Good, Lively Contest
SCORE TWO TOUCHDOWN n
Victorious Eleven Adopts Ag
gressive Tactics, Keeping Ball
in Their Opponents' Ground
The football elevens of the Lime Point
Tigers of the Coast Artillery and of the
Twenty-fourth Battery lined up on the
Presidio field yesterday afternoon in the
, championship struggle for army hon
ors. The Tigers began with a rush and
succeeded in maintaining the fast clip
throughout, winning by a score of 11
to 0. tr&Vi
Although the field was in a sloppy
condition the kickers put up a fast and
lively game. Both teams played hard.
for there is a bitter spirit of rivalry ex
isting between them. Several men were
laid out during the progress of the bat
tle, but no one was seriously hurt. J. *â ;
A fair-sized crowd was on hand to
witness the contest. The Tigers had
the sympathy of the spectators in the
grand stand, and every time on* of
their members made a long: run or a
good tackle the feat was rewarded with
a deafening volley of cheers from the
ardent rooters In blue.
The Tigers kicked off in the first half
and succeeded in running the ball up on
their opponents' twenty-five-yard line.
McMasters, the captain and fullback
of the team, then tried for a field goal.
It was a pretty kick, but missed the
pole by a few feet.
Again the Tigers got the ball, and
after a series of rushes brought it down
the field and sent Quarterback Ems
wiler over the line for a touchdown a
few minutes before the whistle sounded
at the en& of the first half. Me Masters
then kicked a goal, making the score 8
to 0 in favor of the Tigers at the end of
the half.
The battery kickers made a better
showing in the second half. Their de
fense was exceedingly good, and many
times they stopped the fierce rushes of
their opponents. They failed to gain
ground, however, when they got the
ball, as the Tigers' line was strong and
the men played together in good form.
It was rush and tackle for most of the
second half till the Tigers took a sud
den brace toward the end and rushed
the pigskin up to their opponents' five
yard line. Then they executed a neat
mass play and the second touchdown
came easy. McMasters again tried for
a goal, but was unsuccessful. Folio v,-

OF COUNTRY TELEPHONE
Rural Ijncs Owned by Farmers Do
Away With Excessive
Rates.
Every progressive farmer should
have a telephone. He cannot afford
to be without one. Time is money.
and the telephone saves time. It is
easier, quicker and cheaper to talk
than it is to walk or ride. The time
has arrived when we must realize the
importance of being in touch with our
!Â«--iehbors and with the world,
Communities should build their own
telephone lines if they cannot get
s-<!irfactory service at reasonable rates
rom existing: companies. It is a con
riderable undertaking, but the coun
:ry is already dotted with independent
telephone exchanges thus established
which are eminently successful.
, Tlie first thing to do in organizing
a telephone company is to agitate the
question and make the neighborhood
lifiderstand its great value; "that it is
Â¦x good business investment, a public
improvement, a distinct social advan
tage and a positive personal conveni
ence; that a telephone in the house en
ables one to call a doctor without
dangerous delay, to give immediate
alarm in case of fire or burglars, to
avoid a needless trip to town, to call
the . butcher, the baker, the grocer
and to bring one into quick touch
v!th, the railroad, the telegraph, the
postofÃce or the bank. The telephone
enables the busy farmer to transact
business at the farm that would other
Â«is* necessitate his absence from
home. In a large measure it elimi
nates the only strong objection to
farm life â isolation. With a telephone
in the house the farmer's wife is never
'.one. Every subscriber is. as it were.
Srj the next room. The best proof of
its value is the fact universalâ that
people ho once have a telephone al
most never have it taken out. The
r.nly objection against the farmer hav
ing a telephone was by a man who
anted an excuse to go to town. He
< ould not get any satisfaction out of a
rink of whisky over a telephone wire.

Mr. Foote"s illress was of briei

seme time past his health has been
poor and last week he caught a severe
cold, which caused an abscess to form

spread through his system. Ror tin
last three days Mr. Foote was uacon
scious and the efforts of the attend
ing physicians to rally him proved fu
tile. He passed away shortly atter 4

DISTINGUISHED CAREER.
William W. Foote was one of the
best known lawyers and politicians In
the Stat< of California. He was born
at Jackson. Mi??.. January 16, 1846. He
v, as the son of Hon. Henry S. Foote,
United States Senator from that State,
and subsequently Governor, having de

ing to the First Tennessee Infantry,

sition of the troops following the ad
vance "f the Federal army under Gen
eral Grant he and his command were
assigned to Fort Do-nelson, the objec
tive of the movement of the Union
army.
The artillery force at this important
potet on January 15, 1862, according to
the report of Colonel Milton A. Haynes.
who was put in charge at that time,
was compc-sed of two companies of vol
unteer and untrained infantry and
Maney'p battery of light artillery,
which Haynes organized into a bat
talion of 300 and gave daily drill with
the heavy guns.
By the most vigorous efforts the fort
was prepared for the expected on
slaught, which was begun with a bom
bardment from the gunboats under Ad
miral A. H. Foote. February 13. "At
the close of the day." says Colonel
Haynes in his statement of the battle
contained in the Rebellion Records,
published by order of Congress, "the
contest by land and water closed, and
our batteries were visited by Generals
Floyd and Pillow and our artillerists
limented by them."
HONORABLY MENTIONED.
Tn the same report he gave honorable
mention to the subject of this sketch,
savin p:: "During my service at Fort
Donel&on, both before and during the
engagements. I was under obligations
to At ting Adjutant William Vv*. Foote
of the corps of artillery, a boy only 16
years old. and to Lieutenant H. S. Bed
ford, adjutant of the artillery battalion,

of the arduous and dangerous duties
which they had to perform."'

the water batteries over the Federal
fleet, the land operations compelled sur

LADIES PLAY
CUP MATCHES
Competition for the Jackman
tennis Trophy Is Xot Com
pleted on the Park Courts
"The fifth ; handicap singles tourna
ment for the Jackman Cup was played
by the" ladies of the Golden Gate Ten
nis Club yesterday on the park courts.
Many spectators were on hand to watch
the, fair racket wielders and they were
treated: to some good tennis. â¢-
At the end of the day's play but
three of the thirteen . players entered
were left in the competition. - Miss
Hotchkiss again won a place in the
finals and will 'meet the winner of the
match between ; MsBB Ethel^Ratcliffe
and Miss Lulu 'Wegener. Miss Hotch
kiss and Miss Rateliffe have ; each won
the cup. the latter twice and the for
mer once. If Miss Rateliffe can beat
the two remaining players the cup
will become her property.
Miss^ -Miriam Edwards, who won the
initial event for the cup, : was beaten
badly by Miss Rateliffe. v The loser has
not played for months and was off in
her game. ; Â¦ Â¦>. *
i The handicaps were the largest ever
given in a ladies' tournament, but still
two out -of the three scratch players
survived. In one match each â¢ lost a
set and the matches throughout were
closer and more interesting than* usual.
The default of both Miss Valleau and.
Miss Maud Varney made matters rath
er easy for Miss Hotchkiss. In the
preliminary round she had a hard. time
beating Miss Crocker, who received
odds of /'SO." The winner, placed
"15 3-6" behind scratch, lost the first
set but won the next two. In the semi
finals Miss Hotehkiss showed her great
ability when she owed "15 3-6" and
gave "15" to Miss Anita Beyfuss. The
scratch player lost only j one game :in
two sets . MiS3 Beyfuss did not play
well. ... .
: Miss Wegener and Mrs. , Watson met
on even terms . and a close match re
sulted. Miss Wegener, by winning, ob
tained a place in the semi-finals.
Miss Rateliffe refused to play her
semi-final match with Miss Wegener,
claiming that there were shadows on
the court. The committee was apsibus
to finish the event down to the finals,
but [ Miss , Ratcliffe was obdurate and
the match was put over till : next Sat
urday. .
The match between Miss Wegener
and Miss Rateliffe would have been a
good one. With odds of "15" and owe
â¢'15 3-6" Miss , Wegener certainly ; looks
to have an excellent chance. The two
remaining matches should both be good
ones. Miss Hotchkiss played a strong
game and if she loses her conqueror
will have to play great . tennis. " The

Some lively practice matches were
played on the California Club courts
yesterday afternoon. The closest and
most interesting was that between
Drummond.MacGavin and Robert Va
riel and Herbert Schmidt and Harry
Rolfe. The latter team caused quite
a surprise by winning three sets out of
four. MacGavin and Variel are the
strongest team of the University of
California and the "pony" team should
feel proud of their victory. The last
two sets were Â», close. Variel has not
touched a racket for several months
and was far from being at his best.
Another good match was that in
which Dr. Hardy and Dr. McChesney
won two sets | out of : three from Mac-
Gavin and | Mr. . Neah The last named

The brain is an important organ,

For a long time scientists were un

Douglas Mao Adams Says That
He .Was Wrecked, Taken as

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
:,*/* 1118 Broadway, Feb. 13.
As the finis of a wild tale more re
plete with alleged adventures and
miraculous escapes than the most lurid
dime novel, . Douglas MacAdams, aged
I years, claims he was robbed of 590
this evening near Twelfth and Kirkham
streets while lying in an 'epileptic fit.
His home is in Ballard/Wash. He says
he arrived here from the Orient.yester
day en the transport Logan arid was
en route to his home when he was over
come by the fit. He was taken to the
Receiving Hospital.
His story, in brief, is that when he
was scarcely If years old he shipped on
the Arctic whaler Wyneria, which was
subsequently wrecked off the coast of
Siberia. He was one of three survivors
to reach the shore. From the point
where he was wrecked he worked his
way to Vladivostok. From there he
went to Japan and entered the revenue
service of that country. Leaving this,
he attempted to make, a journey 175
miles overland.
At Hakata, Japan, he claims, he was
taken for a Russian spy and stoned
nearly to death by the populace. It was
here he received injuries to his head.
He was then cast into prison and sen
tenced to be shot, he asserts. Twenty
four hours before the. alleged sentence
was to be executed the United States
Embassador at Tokio â¢ Intervened, and
subsequently secured him passage to
the United States.

HEAVY COST OF ONE
- ACT OF INCIVILITY
Politeness Is Always Good Policy and
Reverse Action Often Proves
a Boomerang.
William Travers Jerome, District
Attorney of New York City, in speak
ing of the necessity, of public men ex
ercising, courtesy to anybody and
everybody, told the following story:
"I want to say, :in the first place,
that what I am about to relate is not
told in order to emphasize the need of
politeness on the ground of mere pol
icy, but rather to show that an un
gentlemanly action is pretty sure to
act as a boomerang. Some years ago
a reporter culled on a man of wealth
and prominence, whom I will call Mr.
Blank, in order to interview him in
regard to the lattar's alleged political
ambitions. He was shown into the
library
1 'Well,' said the great man.
"The reporter presented his card
and explained his errand. Mr. Blank
glanced at the pasteboard, deliberately
tore it in two and threw it into the
waste basket.
" "Nothing to say,' he growled; and
that was all the visitor could get, from
him.
"So the reporter departed, with a
flush on his cheek on his cheek and a
burning desire in his heart to thrash
the discourteous Mr. Blank.
"Several years passed, and Mr.
Blank was a candidate . for a high
municipal office. Meanwhile, the re
porter had been made political editor
of a journal whose views were oppo
site to those of Mr. Blank. In that
caoacitv he again called on Mr. Blank,
j! B. Rhodes, and the convention .was ad- ;
journed for : 'a| basket supper ; served' in
the parlors of the church, fit which Dr.
Ray -E/'Gilsdn acted as toastmaster.
: The opening i devotional service of
the evening session was conducted by
Miss Marguerite' Harford and the new
ly 'elected officers' were' jj then j installed
by the Rev. Charles rR. Brown, pastor
of the First .Congregational ] : Church.
Following a vocal solo by A. A. Mc-
Gurda. Leo L. Rodgers- answered the
question. "What Are We Going to Do
About the Juniors?" Dr. O.S. Dean
rendered a vocal solo and Professor
Raymond M. Alden discussed "The
Pledge, What Does It Mean to Us?"
The closing address -was delivered by
the Rev. E. E. Baker, pastor of the
First; Presbyterian Church, who spoke
on "The Forward Look,"- and the con
vention . ended with . consecration ser
vices conducted by W. Clyde Smith.

REAL WHITE ] BLACKBIRD ,
FOUND ; IN ENGLAND
The Scientific Explanation of the
Cause of the Strange
Phenomena.
A genuine albino blackbird has just
been shot near Oatterick Bridge, York
shire. Scientific ornithologists have
clearly enough explained the physio
logical nature of albinism in birds, but
it is still a mystery, says the Pall Mall
Gazette, what originates these physio
logtc&l conditions, and also why it is
that very dark-plumaged birds, such
as blackbirds, rooks, etc., are nfore lia
ble to albinism, pure or partial, than
any other. It is strange, for instance,
that white robins are rare, and it is
notable that the last found in this
country was obtainable in Yorkshire
(Sedbergh district). Last summer a
perfectly white sand martin was seen
by hundreds in the Bentham (York
shire) district and three or four in
ether parts of the north of England.
House martins, also barn swallows^
are liable to assume albinism, and
many records are preserved in York
shire. As for "pied" blackbirds, rooks
and suol-i like, they are as common as
the proverbial blackberries, whereas in
the whole of England there are proba
bly not more than two records of al
bino woodcocks. Â¦
and found him suave and silky. The
editor did not forget the torn card.
The Incident rankled within him.
"So it came about that he made
such a tremendous fight against Mr.
Blank's election that, mainly through
his efforts, he suffered an overwhelm
ing defeat.
"A single act of unnecessary rude
ness cost him position and power." â
Success,
GETTING NEARER
SECRET OF LIFE
Dr. Jacques Loeb of the Uni
versity of Califprnia Makefl
a Very Interesting: Discovery
TELLS OF EXPERIMENTS
Believes That It May Be Pos
sible to Apply Them [Success
fully to Human Species
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ 2148 Center Street, Feb. 13.
Professor Jacques Loeb has achieved
such results in his experiments with
the fertilization of the egg of the sea
urchin with the aperm of the starfish
that he now ventures to say that it
may bÂ« possible to apply these prin
ciples to the problem of infection and
immunity In the human being. This
sweeping statement he makes in a bul
letin he issued at the university to
day under the title of "Further Ex
periments on the Fertilization of the
Egg of the Sea Urchin With Sperm of
Various Species of Starfish and a
Holothurian."
In the event that Dr. Loeb's hy
pothesis proves correct on further in
vestigation it will rank as one of the
greatest achievements in biological
science.
Dr. Loeb's latest investigations have
been to determine under what condi
tions the eggs became fertilized. He
found that it depended upon the pres
ense or the absence in the surrounding
solution of very minute quantities of
certain substances. This led him to
believe that the main variable deter
mining the entrance of the spermata
zoon into the egg .may be in the na
ture of surface tension or a function of
the latter. The point is strengthened
by the fact that there are great indi
vidual variations in the sperm of the
starfish of the same species in its
power of fertilizing with the eggs of
the sea urchin.
"These facts," he says, "may have
some bearing on the problem of infec
tion and immunity. Especially that
which we call the predisposition for
an infection may depend on equally
slight variations in the constitution of
the liquids of our body as the varia
tions on which the fertilization of the
sea urchin egg with the sperm of the
starfish in sea water depends. If our
supposition be correct that in the lat
ter case the controlling variable is of
the nature of surface tension it stands
fo "reason "that the variable in the case
of individual predisposition for infec
tion is also of this nature."
Dr. Loeb intends shortly to publish
his conclusions from these investiga
tions in a more c6mprehehsive form.
HOW LADY FFREXCH
WOULD SPELL HER NAME
liOi'd Sherborne Contends That Two
Small "ffs" Is an Eyesore to
the Pubnc.
An extraordinary controversy has
been raging in the English press with
regard to the spelling of certain names
in the peerage and baronetage which
begin with a doubl? consonant, the
question having been raised apparently
by Lady ffrench's (sic) donation of
money to the new cathedral at West
minster for the erection of an altar on
the condition that her name should be
spelt as in olden times, with two small
"ffs" instead of with a capital "F,"
which has led Lord Sherborne to write
to the papers protesting against this
"affectation," which he declares "an
eyesore to the public" and a "self
degradation."
The ffrenches of Lord ffrench's fam
ily are, so far as I know, the only peo
ple whose names begin with a double
consonant who declined to use the capi
tal letter.
The way that the use of these double
consonants arose â they are all double
"ffs" and double "11s"â is that in the
olden timesâ that is to say. in the early
days of printingâ the capital "F" and
the capital "L" were made by means
of duplicating small "fs" and small
"Is." But of course the adoption of the
present capital "F" and the present
capital "L" as printed renders su
perfluous the use of the double letter.
Some people, instead of using two small
consonants, like Lady ffrench, are sat
isfied with nothing else than two capi
tals, (and in the English army list
there will be found one or more officers
who write their name "LLoyd," which
is just as much an affectation as that
of the ffrench family.
I may add that Sir Thomas ffrench.
at the beginning of the eighteenth cen
tury, abandoned the small "f." But it
was resumed by his successors and is
now used by all the members of the
family. Th? latter was founded by Ed
mund ffrench. Mayor of Galway, in
1606. The peerage was first conferred
upon Lady ffrench of Castle ffrench at
the end of the eighteenth century, with
remainder to her son. The present Lord

brother and heir living at Johannes
burg, in the Transvaal.â Baltimore

Fencing a Free Gift.
The municipality of Rheims was late
ly thrown into considerable consterna
tion by the bequest from one of its citi
zens of 250,000 francs for the erection of
a fountain. Now, Rheims is justly
famed for its champagne, but Its water
supply is far from plentiful, and there
is none to waste on a fountain. The
municipality has therefore ordered its
sculptor to make a fountain that shall
resemble a fountain as little as possi
ble. And the sculptor has carried the
idea still further by suggesting that
the jeta of water should be represented
in stone and bronze. The usual nymphs
and trltons would lend a plausible air
to this waterless scene. But the ques
tion Is whether this carries out the be
quest of the benevolent citizen who left
his money to build a public fountain.
On this opinion is hotly divided, and it
is probable that only Alice In Wonder
land or the March hare could decide
when a fountain is not a fountain.â

made to take the late secretary of the
Regents of the University of California

While he has little to say in regard
to his sentence, the suspense is
with, and he shows it in his demeanor
which is noticeably more cheerful than
at any time since his incarceration. He
was fearful that he might get the
maximum penalty of ten years for hia
offense. But the fact that he was sen
tenced to serve but six years and
eleven months', which he can still
further reduce by good conduct to four
years and nine months, has given him
hope.

INHUMAN SON
SENT TO JAIL
JvdgÃ Samuels Imposes the
Heaviest Sentence in His
Power on Peter Knutli
Oaklan/1 Office dan Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Feb. 13.
Peter Knuth. a teÂ«mster who a week
ago beat his aged mother, Mrs. R.
Knuth, in her residence, 737 Myrtle
street, was given a portion of his
earthly reward this morning by Police
Judge Samuels, who gave him the
limit of six months' imprisonment on
a charge of battery. For good meas
ure the court also sentenced Knuth to
thirty days' additional imprisonment
on a charge of malicious mischief pre
ferred by his mother for having broken
up the home furniture.
A week ago Knuth returned home in
a drunken condition. He first upset
the stove. When remonstrated with he
?lew into a rage and struck his mother
on the face with his clenched fist. This
morning the mother's face looked as
if it had been beaten with a hammer.
The defendant did not make any
statement In his own defense. In pass
ing sentence Judse Samuels made the
single comment. "You are too low to
speak to, " and then imposed the heav
iest sentence in his power.
The mother tearfully explained that
The only reason she prosecuted her son
was that she wanted a little peace at
home with her other two children.
HOW DARKY PREACHERS
TWIST THE TONGUE
An "Exhauster's"' -Naive Comment on
the ' Miracle of the Loaves
and/Fishes.
"Down near -Oxon Hill, " said an em
ploye of the street cleaning department,
"'the colored brethren of the Methodist
denomination were- holding a series of
revival meetings. A young fellow who
was called an "exhauster, 1 or, more
properly, an exhorter, occupied the pul
pit of the church one evening and was
telling the congregation about miracles.
He related a number of Biblical stories,
and finally began to explain the miracle
of the loaves and the fishes. He evi
dently had not .looked up the subject
for some time, and he twisted the story
around in this, shape. He said:
â¢"'Brethren, "take the miracle of the
loaves and the fishes. Theer were 5000
loaves and 7000 fishes and only twelve
people there to eÂ«t 'em, and the miracle
is dat dey didn't all bust.' "
An employe; of the sewer department
then related an incident which occurred
on a ferryboat between . Washington
and Alexandria. He said:
! "There was a large number of col
ored people on board the < board, bound
for Alexandria to attend the dedication
of a new church in the Virginia city.

a m:\y adornment
for summer dresses
One Way to Secure a Ilttud-
Painted Frock at Small
Cost. )
Hand-painted gowns and dress acces
sories decorated in a similar manner
are considered Quite exclusive, and will
be fashionable for summer wear. Not
I only silks, but inexpensive muslins,
lawns and organdies are transformed
into beautiful fabrics by this simple
means. As the method is within the
reach of any one, the deft-fingered
I woman can obtain surprising results.
An exquisite party gown recently
seen was worn by a young girl, who
whispered into the ears of an admiring
: friend that the entire costume cost less
i than $15. This statement was explained
i satisfactorily by the informant, who
â¢ said that she had decorated the cos
; tume herself.
The dress was a soft white diaphan-
o us affair, made of organdy, and with
1 row after row of billowy flounces. The
entire gown was sprinkled with violets,
single and in clusters. A soft white
fichu of lace hung in long loops in
I front, and at the end of each one was
suspended a bunch of violets made of
ribbon, and tied with violet louisine
silk bows. Violets were also painted
on the white kid slippers worn with
I the gown, and three or four stray vio
lets were painted on the white fan.
This effect was obtained, by the use
I of violet dye. which was applied with a
brush, after the flowers were outlined
on the fabric. Blotting ' paper was
placed underneath the cloth while
painting it, to absorb all moisture and
' to prevent the dye from spreading. The
I material was then left to dry, and
afterward another coat of a lighter
! violet was put on the blossoms to
i shade them. A green leaf here and
: there added to the artistic effect of the
gown.
It is a good plan to experiment first
' on cheap muslin before attempting
I anything more elaborate. There may
' be some trouble at first with the dye
I or water color paints spreading, but
1 with a little care this difficulty can be
overcome.
One of the prettiest gowns seen deco
rated with this shadow painting was a
j white silk painted with wild roses. The
; white mousseline boa, edged with ruch
' Ing, had a wild rose dotted here and
' there on the edge. A white silk head
j scarf, edged with a three-inch chiffon
flounce, was also decorated with roses.
Another clever idea for painting on
fabrics is to take a daintily colored
picture of the desired size and design
: and lay it upon the cloth. Prick holes
in the picture with a needle, following
the outlines closely. Then take a small
bag filled with lampblack or fine crayon
and rub over the perforated outlines.
When the paper is removed the design
will be found outlined on the material.
Of course, there should be a contrast
I between the fabric and the powder used
in outlining. -;
For this mode, before beginning to
paint, stretch the silk or fabric upon a 'Â¦
board on the .table. Paint with a- fine '
pointed brush, . being careful that the i
outlines are exactly followed and that
the colors match the design. Lay the :
water color paint upon the fabric light
ly at first, for if it is too thick it may
crack and ruin the picture. .
Before using .the paint should be
1 thoroughly mixed with "gold size" or
! opaque mixture. Should the work look
dull when finished it can be brought
out by using sicatif lightly upon the
surface. Another good plan is to place
the colors on blotting paper two or <
three days before using, so that all the
oil will be absorbed.
This latter mode of decorating is more !
appropriate for sofa pillows, pin cush
ions, portieres and such articles than !
for dresses and furbelows. â Washing- j

"Please, ma'am, will you give me an
old suit of your husband's clothes? I
am one of the Kansas flood sufferers."
"Poor man. Of course I will. Come
right in. So you were in that dreadful
flood, were you?" "No, ma'am, but my
v.ife sent all my clothes to the people
v. ho were." â Brooklyn Eagle.

LIVES ARK IMPERILED
TO HELP DRESS WOMAN
The Story of the Aigrette, the Most
Costly of All Feathers. : ;
A bird on a hat may or may not
proclaim its value, but an aigrette,
that most fashionable of all feather
ornaments this season, tells in no un
certain language to those who under
stand that it is much . more than
worth its weight in gold. â¢ -^'vv'
Feathers flutter from here, there
and everywhere upon the hats and
heads of fair women, but the aigrette
has both a history and a romance at
tached to it. For no other decorative
feathers do men so imperil their lives,
and a steamship company runs a spe
cial line of vessels, yet the aigrette is
merely a small ornament for woman's
hair or decoration for her hat. It is
to feathers what the orchid is to flow
ers, something very rare, beautiful
and procurable only with more or less
risk to the hunter.
Some of tire most fashionable ai
grettes come* from Venezuela, some
from the port of Bahia, in Brazil;
some from the island of Trinidad, and
others from a thousand miles up the
Amazon River. These are the beau- :
tiful feathers of the heron, and scarce
ly a woman who wears one knows that
a line of ocean steamships makes tri
angular trips â principally' in search
of these feathers â 'going from Liver
pool to a thousand' miles up the Ama
zon, and thence to New York. "''Â¦?Â¦/;
In Brazil the market value of ' ai-'.
grettes, in the crude state, is about;
$6 an ounce for the long and $21 for
the short variety, with even higher
values for those coming from Vene
zuela and Trinidad. In New York the
wholesale price for crude feathers is
from $23 to 530 per ounce for the
short or "cross" feathers, and about
$7 50 to $10 per ounce for the long
variety. The price is steadily rising.
These feathers are never purchased
in large or wholesale lots. They rep
resent usually both difficulty and
danger in the gathering. Hunters and
fishermen along the watercourses of
the Amazon and other, South Ameri
can rivers uenetrate into thick jungles
and lie in wait along the river .banks
and in swamps awaiting the arrival of
the blue heron to feed. The heron
does not feed in droves, but is a soli
tary individual and very wary, so that
aigrettes are only yielded up after a
long chase and much perseverance.
As for the risk, every one knows
that danger lurks on every hand in
an Amazon â danger from rep
tile and beast and insect and the dead- ,
liest of fevers. It is no uncommon \
thing for scores of aigrette hunters
to perish miserably in the jungle in ,
the course of a year.
Those hunters who come out of the !
forests with their treasures sell them 1
to the small shopkeepers along the
Amazon, who in turn send the ai
grettes to the agents of American pur
chasers, or consign them to some com
mission. house in New; York. â

Hurricane Figures.
The Scientist who tells us that 156
miltp an hour is the greatest velocity
ever attained by the wind sets himself
10 prove the impossible. But his fig
ures will serve as a record, no doubt.
It is an appalling condition that such a
rate represents. A light breeze means
fourteen miles an hour, with a pres
sure of one pound to the square foot;
multiply your light breeze by six and
you have a hurricane eighty-four miles
an hour and thirty-six pounds pressure
to the square foot. You can go into
higher altitudes and fare worse. Ben
Nevis has a 120 miles an hour record.
Awful damage can be done at lesser
rates. The Ohio tornado of 1842 had a
speed of but thirty-four miles, but it
took buildings up by their foundations
and carried their fragments. ' eight
miles. A similar disturbance in Illinois
took the spire, vane and silded ball of
a church all complete and carried them
intact fifteen miles to the northeast
ward. The Forth bridge is built to
withstand a fifty-six pounds wind pres
sure. It is no thanks to a late astron-,
omer royal that such strength was im
posed. The present strength allows
for a lateral pressure from wind of
2000 tons per 1700-foot span, two and a
half times the amount of the maximum
rolling load.â St. James Gazette.

Speaker Thomas B. Reed had for the
first time, amid continuous uproar, en
forced his new rules upon the House,
I and that body was in open revolt.
Many members of his own party re
â¢ belled at the imperious dictatorship of
the Speaker. ..".
The Speaker's imperious domination
over the popular body of Congress was
generally declared to be contrary to a

A new catch-line had to be invented
immediately, because the page was
"made-up" and waiting. After several

THE SORROWS OF
THE STOUT LADY
"You Are Getting Stouter Every Day"
Is the Friendly Greeting on
All Sides.
When they want you to feel uncom
monly amiable your acquaintances
look you up and down, then beam on
you and declare, "You're getting flesh
ier every day."
Why is this? Why should a fact of
which the stout are already sorrow
fully aware be continually pressed on
their attention? What would be
thought of the breeding of a stout per
son who constantly flung their emacia
tion in the face of the thin? who made
facetious remarks about skeletons in
their pretence? or ran his fingers over
their sparsely covered ribs as small
boys jolt a stick along the pickets of a
fence?
The magazines of the day also per
mit no forgetfulness to the stout. In
the advertising pages of periodicals of
almost every sort, in big black letters
you are exhorted, "Don't Be Fat." As
if you wanted to be fat, as if any one
eat down and deliberately got fat!
You 6ee yourself â I am talking to the
stoutâ caricatured In that ponderous
lady wearing an extremely decollete
gown who comes wobbling toward you
like the car of Juggernaut (I see she
hac taken to sitting down lately, and
it's no wonder), or you are reflected In
that misguided female who affects a
plaid skirt, cut on the bias, of all
things!â The Reader.
Passing of Longhorn and Cowboy.
The cowboy is gone from Indian Ter
ritory. Allotment has practically bro
ken up the cattle business in the Indian
Territory, and this year there will be
almost a total absence of the big herds
which have for years grazed the rich
grasses of Indian Territory. The In
dian ag?nt states that there seems to
be no move whatever on the part of
cattlemen to take grazing leases this
year, and there will be none. Leases
of this kind cannot be made for a pe
riod longer than one year, and as most
Df the allotments are being fenced the
cow man cannot longer handle his cat
tle under the old regime. The Here
ford and Shorthorn have taken the
place of the Texas ranger, and the
herdr. have been broken up into small
tuncb.es, owned and cared for by the
farmers.â New York Tribune.
Boers in Mexico.
Mexico knows good citizenswhen she
sees them, and she is determined to
have the proposed Boer colony estab
lished in the State of Chihuahua. The
Government Jias advanced $50,000 out
of the natjonal treasury with which to
make a part payment on an immense
tract, and â¢will allow the Boers twenty
five years in which to repay the loan.
Several banks in the City of Mexico
have also advanced large sums. The
Boers will not be obliged to pay taxes,
and will be exempted from military
service. Mexico wants these sturdy
farmers, and will probably $et them. â

an Outing.
Major C. T. Poul'.er of the Fifth
Infantry has been detailed to preside
at an election to be held in Company
F. X. G. C. Oakland, for < aptain and
first lieutenant. It is understood that
the incumbents, whose terms Rave
about expired, will not be candidates
for re-flection.
Lieutenant Colonel Connolly of the
First Infantry will preside at an elec
tion to be held February 2 7 at the
headquarters of the Second Brigade
for a major of the Fifth Infantry, vice
Major Poulter, term expired.
The occasion will be made one by
Colonel Hayes of holding- a meeting- of
the officers of the Fifth Infantry to
discuss matters conflicted with the
work of the regiment during the cur
rent year.
First 1-ieutenant SchoenfeLdt and
Second Lieutenant Beck of Company
I, Fifth Infantry, located at Liver
more, have undergone a successful
examination before the examining:
board, which entitles them to obtain
their commissions.
The annual meeting of Company D.
Fifth Infantry, held in San Rafael last
week, was attended by almost every
member. The reports show the com
pany to be active and in a prosperous
condition. A definite plan of prepar
ation for the approaching inspection
and for the training for the next camp
was outlined. It was stated that In
case there should not be a National
Guard camp with the regulars this
year the company may go south for
an outing. Musician Schlosser of this
company has been appointed regi
mental color sergeant.
A movement has been started in
San Rafael to have the band of the
Fifth Infantry, recently organized and
composed exclusively of natives of
Marin County, giva two concerts a
week in that city during the summer
season.
Captain Holtum. commanding' Com
pany B, Fifth Infantry, located at San
Jose, had his command at Cyclers'
Park last Sunday. The men were giv
en instructions in military matters,
including: skirmish drill, tent drill and
guard mount. Upon returning to the
armory the company partook of a
banquet. The company proposes to
have a number of such outingrs during
the year and contemplates an all dny
and nght camp with Company I ut
Livermore in the vicinity of Niles
Canyon. The companies will go into
camp on Saturday night and remain
until the following: night.
Musicians at Outs.
Prof. E. S. Bonelli has brought suit in
the Superior Court for 510.000 against
Theodore Salmon, a teacher of the piano,
whom he charges with unprofessional
conduct. The complaint reads that for
the past three years Miss Maybelle Kelly
has been a pupil of Prof. Bonelli, and
was so until the 3rd day of Febru
ary, l:) 04, when her last lesson was
given at the Conservatory conducted by
the professor. Also that on Thursday
evening, January L'B. 1904, Mr. Salmon
gave a musieale, at which Miss Kelly ap
peared. Being represented as a pupil of
Mr. Salmon, when, in fact, she was still
a pupil at Prof. Bonelli's Conservatory
and had taken her regular lesson there
the day before. All is, therefore, not un
interrupted harmony in the musical
world. In speaking of the case Prof.
Bonelli says that such an act is un
precedented in the musical profession
and that Mr. Salmon could not claim
ignorance of the fact that Miss Kelly
was a pupil of the Conservatory,
as he had been present at the profes
sor's concert when Miss Kelly had taken
part, on January 6. 1904. Mr. Bonelli
naturiilly feels grieved over the fact that
the music-loving public may have been
led to the opinion that Miss Kelly's high
attainments as a musician were the di
roct results of the efforts of another in
structor than himself. As a result Mr.
Bonelli states that Miss Kelly was re
quested to discontinue her lessons at the
Conservatory. He considered Mr. Sal
mon's action a deliberate attempt to
steal his thunder and feels confident that
tlie Superior Court will award him dam
ages.
Sanitary Condition of Hotels.
Health Officer Ragan yesterday in
structed District Health Officers Till
man. Dillon and Adler to make inves
tigations and report on the sanitary
conditions of all lodging-houses, hotels
and hospitals:. Action will be taken in
conjunction with that of the Board of
Public Works, which last week di
rected Inspector Hergan to report on
the location and structural condition
of all such buildings.
POISONER GETS

for the Ess* of Her Yeai's
â â
WOMAN VEILS HER FACE
Motion for a New /Trial Is
JA'ju'od and an Appeal Will
Be f J;Â»l;cn to Supreme Court
Mrs. Martha K. Buwers. who was con
victed by a jury in Judge Cooks court
of a charge of murdering her husband.
Martin L. Bowers, by administering
poison to him, was formally sentenced
by the Judge yesterday. Shr will spend
the remainder of her days in San Quen
tin, the jury having fixed her punish
ment at life impi-isonment.
The defendant was dressed in black
and a heavy black veil concealed her
features. The Judge In passing sen
tence did not ask her to raise her veil.
Her sister. Mrs. Zylphia Sutton. sat be
side her and offered her whatever con
solation she could prior to and after
sentence was pronounced.
When the defendant was asked if she
had an; thing to say why sentence
should not be passed upon her Attorney
Frank G. Drury arose and made a mo
tion for a new trial. HÂ« based the mo
tion on several grounds, including
among others that the jury had been
guilty of misconduct, that the evidence
was insufficient, that the Judge had
misdirected the jury and that new and
important evidence for the defendant
had been discovered.
Drury spoke at considerable length in
support of the motion, dwelling partic
ularly on the medica! testimony and
arguing that there was ample evidence
to show that death was due to natural
causes. He was followed by Attorney
Caldwell of Fresno, who had been
brought into the case.
The Judrje denied the motion for a
new trial, but at the request of the de
fendant's attorneys granted a stay of
twenty days to enable them to prepare
the papers for an appeal to the Su
preme Court.
APPEAL FOR CLEMENCY
HAS EFFECT OX JUDGE
Yinrcnt le. Corvee, French Sailor,
Convicted of Manslaughter, Sen
tenced to Serve Six Years.
Vincent le Corvee, who was tried
for murder before a jury in Judge
Cook's court and convicted of man
slaughter, appeared for sentence yes
terday. Attorney Cornet made an
impassioned appeal to the Judge for
mercy, and considering the good
character given the defendant by the
captain of the vessel on which the de
fendant v.aa a sailor, the Judge made
the sentence six years in San Quen
tin.
The defendant, while under the in
fluence of liquor, on the night of Jan
uary 12, quarreled with his shipmates
on board the French bark Vircente
gorix and fatally stabbed one of them,
Vincent le Meur. When the case was
called in the Police Court and also in
the Superior Court the defendant's at
torney raised the question of juris
diction, holding that under the treaty
with France the defendant should be
taken to that country to" be tried.

Judgment was given by Judge
Cook yesterday on the application. for
a writ of habeas corpus : for the re

The defendants were arrest.-! and

Paul Van Loom of the Hotel Franklin
to bet on *he races on the statemen;
that they had inside information. Van
Loon bet and. lost $2850.
The Judge, in rendering:, his decis
ion, said he had carefully read the
transcript of the .testimony, taken at
the preliminary hearing and, although
he was. satisfied the transactions were
the acts of sharpers/there was not one
word of testimony to show . that the
defendants had received; one cent of
the money or had profited by the
complaining witness' loss. Nor was
there, any; evidence,, to coned them
with the man or men who received
the money. . From his knowledge of
the methods of criminals it was easy
to guessÂ« that the defendants partici
pated in the loss, but no one could be
sent to the State's "prison.- on guess

but of late years they have been great
ly relaxed in favor of the sick or of
persons engaged in manual labor re

DOGS OF HIGH
AND LOW DECREE
In the Kaiser's Country Ca
nines Are Strictly Classed
and Taxed Accordingly
RANGE FKOM $4 76 DOWN
System Well Arranged and
Law Enforced With Dili
gence and Impartiality
Like everything else in Germany
dogs are divided into classes. The first
class contains the dogs that are kept
as pets by people in reasy. circum
stances. To the second* class belong
those dogs that are used lor hunting.
The third class includes all dogs that
are kept for working animals by milk
men, butchers, peddlers, etc., in or near
towns and cities.
In the city every dog is taxed, but
there is a distinction made between
the three classes. Dogs of the first
class are taxed SO marks ($4 7s), those
of the second class 10 marks ($2 38) and
those of the third class only 5 marks
($1 19) per annum. This system of tax
ing dogs according to classes seems to
be an excellent one Every one thinks
it perfectly just that those who keep
dogs merely as luxuries should pay
more for them than the people who
keep dogs for working purposes. When
you see some of the dogs for which
people pay nearly $5 a year in taxes
you are willing to admit that "beauty
lies in the eyes of the beholder."
MAXY VARIETIES OF DOGS.
The variety of dog which seems to be
the mopt fancied as a pet in Germany
is the short-legged, elongated Dachs
hund. Some of these dogs are so long
that they are really pitiful sights. Fox
terriers are quite (jpmmon, and. in fact,
nearly every variety of dog is found
here. Bulldogs, however, are very sel
dom seen.
The dogs that are used for hunting
Kre mostly German deer hounds and
bird dogs of the setter and pointer
types. Beagles are seldom used and
are uncommon. Hunting dogs, as a
rule, are kept in the country and very
little is seen of them.
Working dogs are not confined to any
particular variety. Any dog that is
large and strong may be used, and a
great many different kinds are seen.
When a person comes to Germany one
of the first things that is sure to im
press him as strange is the sight of a
dog hitched to a wagon with a woman
as his mate. In Leipzig working dogs
are very numerous and are mostly
owned by the poor people. So far as I
have seen, the dogs are treated with
consideration by their owners and seem
in many cases to really enjoy their
work.
KVFRY CITY HAS A DOG SHOW.
Every large city in Germany has its
annual dog show, and people seem to
take as much, if not more, interest in
them than we do in America.
In all cities and large towns dogs are
required to be muzzled whenever they
are on the streets or in public places.
Small dogs that are not vicious may be
taken on a leash without a muzzle.
When tho tax upon a dog is paid, the
dog is registered and the owner is giv
en.a tag. which must be attached to its
collar. When a dog is allowed upon
the street without its muzzle or its tag,
it is subject to seizure by the dog po
lice, who are a special branch of the
municipal police. The usual fine in
such a case is about . 75 cents where
there is no willful intent or neglect on
the part of the owner. After a dog
has been captured once and its owner
wared, if it is captured again the fine
is much heavier. The only dogs that
are allowed upon the streets without
muzzles are those that are unquestion
ably under three months of age. After
a dog is captured it is taken to the
pound and kept there three days. At
the end of that time, if uncalled for,
he is either sold or disposed of.
The effect of the regulations regard
ing dogs has been to practically ex
terminate stray and useless dogs, and
to restrict the dogs actually kept to
the three classes already given.
The laws are enforced with great
diligence and impartiality, and as a re
sult that much dreaded disease, hydro
phobia, is practically unknown in Ger
many.â Washington Star.

-^ Â¦*> ' . Gilbert Stuart was one of the first of the native Amrrk-an artists who
achieved fame. Â¦ He was not only great in his native land, but hi- portraits
-. , compared favorably with those of his English, -contemporaries, Komney
-| ( and Gainsborough, and of David in France. Among; the many notable per-
sons who sat for him. Washington was the one whose features he waned i
to love "most to portray, and whom he painted, the greatest number of
times. Some of the most lifelike, and characteristic of the portraits of
i . Washington were left in an unfinished state, as if the artist had contented
' himself with securing a likeness of the features and an expression of the
' I . character of the man, and left the filling in of unimportant details to a
more convenient time. - ' < # : /

One of these reproduced in next Sunday's art supplement is pre-
served in the permanent collection of the Lenox library. It shows a three-
, quarter view of the face of the "Father of His Country." The expres-
.;Â¦:Â¦ sion is animated. A ' suspicion of a smile plays about the corners of the
mouth, which has the distorted stiffness : noticeable in all of the later
portraits of Washington. This resulted from an ill - fitting; set 1 of . teeth, \
i made for him in France, and preserved to-day in a museum of dental
, surgery in Baltimore. These teeth were not of porcelain, but the real
1 teeth of sheep.
Stuart was born' at Xarragansett. IÂ». 1.. December :Â». 17.VÂ». and died
in Boston July 27, 1828, the year, after the foundation of the National
1 Academy of Design.. His painting was skillful and delicate, his coloring ,
.brilliant,, his handling free and .at the same time firm, and the strong in- '
â¢ 1 dividuality that marked his work did not conflict with its natural and
i lifelike quality. He Â¦Â¦ was not surpassed as a portraitist in this country -'

Maloahy & Co. of this city yesterday reported
the dullest Saturday on record, only 95,000
â¢ shares changing bands. Cotton was lower and
the situation was easy ail around. The bank
statement was considered rather poor than
otherwise, CTrtog to the Increase in loans.
Dried Fruit in New York.
Mall reports from New York say:
' The market presented the usual Saturday
a.ppÂ«araDce of inactivity Still in one or two
lines there was a considerable display of buy-
Ing interest. Apricots are attracting a good
deal of attention, particularly from exporters,
and the market is strong and higher. The stock
of rtaadard both here and on the coast is said
to be 'entirely cleaned up, and stocks of choice
and extra choice are running low. For choice
Â»*ie is now said to be inside and extra choice
is heli at 10@10%c as to quantity and seller.
In addition to smaller transactions a sa'.e of
about 3500 boxes, covering both grades, was
reported at full -prices, which, It was under
Â»Â«ood. virtually absorbed the holdings of one
-d^f.ler. For Peaches there was a fair Jobbing
c^n&nd at the previous quotations. There was
a considerable demand from east side bayers
fcr Oregon Prunes for shipment from the coast,
the Inquiry being mainly fcr 30s. The latter
Bppear to be growing very scarce in the pri
ir.ary market, and bids of 2c f. o. b. bag basts
have b*en. turned down, though In combina
tions with i'Â« and 50s that price is acceptable.
For 40-506 alone l%c basis is quoted. We
heard of no business of consequence in Cali
fornia Prunes, but the tteady tone of the spot
market was retained. Offerings from the coast
on a 2 J ic basis are still freely made. There
Â¦were no fresh developments In the Raisin situ
ation. Currants were quiet and rather easy
at 4*Â»c for fine AmsAias uncleaned in barrels.

Chicago Board of Trade.
Future Grain and Provisions.
. â¢ CHICAGO, Feb. 13.â wheat pit was
affected more perhaps by the strong cash sit
uation reported . from all ( quarters than by
any other factor. -The demand was principally
for the July delivery, the congested condition
of the May option offering special inducements
to the majority of traders. Wheat prices at
Liverpool . and Paris were considerably higher
than yesterday and the fact that these markets
showed gains in the face of Increased ship
ments from Australia and Argentina helped to
lfstlll confidence into the minds of traders
here. May opened }4Â©-%c to ; %@%c higher
at '.">V'T'"' .;c, .while July was up Â»4@Vic at
B>@BSV4c. There was an early advanoe to
}<STs<gSi>c for July on an active general de
mand, but the May option held about Â¦ steady
during the first hour. The leading long took
advantage of the advance in the price of July
and handed out a considerable line. Smaller
traders followed, the lead and in consequence
a break to SB^4c occurred. The downward
trend of the July delivery affected May, forc
ing the price down to i'"> ! ! I c. St. Louis houses
covered a big line of July late in the session
and the market responded to the improved de
mand and prices again reached the top figures.
Seme of the advance was lost on profit-taking,
but the close was firm, with May at 96 Vie and
July at" SSsic .
The ixirn market was strong, but the vol
ume of business was small owing to a lack
or offerings. May closed at 54^c. July was
14994 c up, closing at 52% c.
The feature of trade in oats was the heavy
buying of both May and July deliveries by
the leading bull houses. The close was prac
tically at the top". July closed at 39% c and
May at 44 He
The provision market was weak early on
general selling, due to liberal . receipts of..hogs
and a decline of 10c In prices at- the yards.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
As usual? on â¢ Saturday trading in Potatoes
was very -quiet and prices of all descriptions
were unchanged. ' Receipts were light, but
there were heavy supplies of river and Oregon
Burbanks >in the. hands of speculators, who
were still asking high prices. The steamer
which arrived '". from Oregon on Thursday
brought ;.down'B33ti sacks of Burbanks, which
did -not -appear on the manifest, making the
total brought by that steamer t,;Â»4s sacks. The
steamer due to-day will bring about 7000 sacks
and 100 sacks of Onions. A carload of Sweets
came in yesterday, but was not marketed; Old
: stock was offering at the previous price.' . but
sold - very slowly.- Onions ruled' firm at un
changed rate**. '* Only ten sacks came In yes
terday. -. . '
'Tomatoes and Green Peas from. Los Angeles
were- rather . weak under heavy receipts, but
all other descriptions from that region were in
li^ht receipt and cleaned up readily at steady
prices. Occasional lots of fancy. Peas sold at
7c"per. pound and. a few small lots of Tomatoes
brought $150. per crate, but the bulk of the
supplies sold Â¦within ' the quoted range. Small
quantities of Asparagus came in from the river
districts and -across the bay and sales were
reported., at . - t;o<&"7sc per pound. Rhubarb

Poultry and Game.
Poultry ruled firm under a continued steady
demand and > the market wag practically bare
at the close. A car of .-Western was marketed,
making, the third for the week. Receipts of
domestic stock were very light and supplies of
large young stock, which had the most call,
were insufficient to satisfy the demand. A car
-of Western falls, due to-morrow. A few cases
'of dressed* Turkey* came In and prices were
nominally unchanged.
' Receipts of i Game were over 200 sacks and
consisted chiefly .Of . wild Ducks, which were
mostly poor and thin. AH dealers were anxious
to clean up, as the season closes on Monday,
and most kinds of Ducks were quoted lower.
There was quite a surplus unsold at the close.

UNITED STATES LEADS
WORLD Oi Â¦Â¦! '111 l
Greatest Exporter of Domestic Prod
Â«*cts â Only Three "Billion Dol
lar" Countries.
The United States again stands, at
the close of the calendar year 1903, at
the head of the list of world's exporting
: nations, so far as relates to the expor
tation of domestic products. ThjÂ» fact
is shown by a series of tables just pre
sented by the Government Bureau tt
Statistics.
There ar c only three "billion dollar
! countries," considered from the stand
point of exportation at domestic prod
ucts, and they are. in order of the mag
i nitude of their exports, the United
l States, the United Kingdom and
many. In the calendar year 1903 the
exports of domestic products were:
, From the United States. $1,547.565, 753
1 in value, and from the United King
dom. $1,415,617,552. From Germany the
figures for the full year have not been
received, but an examination of the fig
ures of the year for which statistics are
available justifies an estimate of J1.2W.
00,000.
It Is only within recent years that
th- United States has taken its
place at the head of the list of the
world's great exporters of domestic
products. In 1375 the exports
I mestic products by the world's great
exporting nations were as foilows:
I'nited Kingdom $1.0Â«7.497.fV<>
France
Ormany 5Ki. 052.000
United States 497.
In 1885 the domestic exports of these
four countries stood as follows:
I'nited Kingdom $I.<W
Germany 680. M1. w0
I'nited States
France 596,000,'HH)
In 1Â»95 the domestic exports of the
four countries were as follows:
United Kingdom $1.1 no. 452 'TOO
United States
Germany 7Â«Â» n
France
In 1903 the relative rank of the four
countries in the exportation of domes
tic products was as follows:
United States $1,437. M8, 7*l
United Kingdom 1.41.'.
liermany i<Â») 1.200. 000. i*m
France ib) M 2.
ia> Nine month* flgtir<-9 and estimate for
closing quarter of the year.
tb) Eleven months flgures and estimate for
last month of the year.
It will be seen from a study of the
above tables that the United States in
1875 stood at the bottom of the I
: the four great exporting nations of the
Â¦ world; that at the end of the next dec
; ade it had advanced one place; a dec
1 ade later still another place, and ie
1903 stood at the head of the list as thÂ«
world's greatest exporter of domesti*
products. â Brooklyn Eagle.
Animal Sympathy.
The devoted love of the brute ap
plies to humbler objects than man. A
cat and dog- used to be very good
friends in a well-known country house.
Onlookers regrarded the cat as selfish,
as caring only for the dog because ha
would fetch and carry for her, and
let her have the choicest place on thÂ«
hearthrug. The dog died. The cat
refused all food and left the house.
It was found upon the dog's f^-ave and
brought back to the house. No per
suasion could get it away. Kind
friends built a little penthouse ovei
the grave, and there the cat lay until,
very soon, it, too, died. In anothei
house were a cat and dog whose rela
tions were of the unfriendliest descrip
tion. The cat had kittens which werÂ«
taken from her and drowned. ShÂ«
grieved terribly over her loss. The
dog appeared to understand her grief,
ceased to torment and chase her; and.
instead, did all he could to displaj
sympathy. At length as the bereavÂ«sj
mother appeared inconsolable, tot
bounded out of the house, sought dIX
igently in the garden, found the grayÂ«
of the kittens, scratched it open with
his strong paws, and returned la tri
umph to the house bearing one of th<
slaughtered innocents in his mouth.â

HEBBARD GIVES
AID TO POLICE
Holds That Officers Have a
\\<?\\\ to Enter the Restau
rant at 709 Pacific Street
MODIFIES INJUNCTION
Scores Dcijartment fop Fail
i 11- 10 Furnish Evidence
in Support of Its Charges
Superior Judge Hebbard yesterday
decided that the restaurant at 739 Pa
cific street, owned by Vicenta Lucich, is
a public place and therefore can be en
tered by the members of the Police De
partment at will, cither in uniform or in
plain clothes. In accordance with his
decision ho modified the temporary in
junction he issued a ftw days ago re
straining the police from entering the
place. '; -,-.- ; -".;
In giving his decision Judge Â¦ bard
touk occasion to comment on the insuf
ficiency of the evidence fur
nished by the police to prove
their charge that the restaurant was
really a cloak to hide immorality. He
said that it was astonishing, consider
ing the array of counsel connected with
the case on the side of the Police De
partment and the department itself,
that so little evidence had been given
the court to show that the restaurant
was in any way connected with the
dens in its rear. ,..
"It is you duty," said the court, "to
Ehow me that this restaurant proprietor
is interested In the other business car
ried on in the same building. It should
be an easy matter for you to prove his
connection. You have not done so, and
the result is that \ cannot entirely dis
solve this Injunction. I do find, how
ever, that this restaurant is an open
and public place, and that therefore the
police have a right to enter it when
they sec fit, but they cannot go into the
courts in the rear of the restaurant,
provoke these unortunate women into
the commission of a misdemeanor, ar
rest them and then drag them through
the restaurant."
The court's decision is but a prelim
inary one. Lucich's suit for a perma
nent injunction will be gone into on its
merits a week from Monday, Judge
Hebbard having refused to grant a
longer delay.
POLICE KAIL I Hi: NVMPHIA.
Wittman Declares He Did Not Violate
Injandioii Issued by Hebbard.
Pursuant to orders issued by Chief
of Police Wittman, a squad of officers
under command of Captain Duke of
the Central station arrested twenty
women in the notorious Hotel Nymphia
last night and booked them on charges
of committing a misdemeanor and va
grancy. In view of the restraining or
der issued by Judge Hebbard the raid
came in the nature of a surprise to
ihc inmates of the resort.
Captain Duke, accompanied by Cor-
I>oial Fraher and Patrolmen II Shane,
C. W. Brown and Attridge, swooped
dowr on ihc place and carted off the
women to the City Prison in the patrol
wagon. All of the officers, with the
exception of tuine, entered the
1 .remises through the restaurant at 739
raeific street- MeShane was left at
the gate entrance at 73" Pacific street.
The women were placed under arrest
and upon the arrival of the wagon Pa
trolman McShane broke down the door
vith a sledge hammer, so that it was
not necessary to escort the prisoners
through the restaurant.
Chief Wittman when seen after the
raid defined the position taken by the
Police Department in the matter. He
stated that the modification made yes
terday to the original restraining or
der issued by Judge Hebbard did not
bar the police from entering the prem
ises in the capacity of private citizens.
3t was the duty of the officers, declared
the Chief, if a violation of the law
was committed In their presence 10
:nake an arrest, whether -"ii or off duty.
Therefore upon being solicited by the
women in the place, which constitutes
s misdemeanor, the police merely did
their duty and arrested the habitues of
the place. According to Chief "Witt
man, the injunction expressly forbid
the taking of the prisoners through the
restaurant, and, acting upon that sec
tion of the Penal Code which states
that when the egress of an officer is
barred after making an arrest he is
Ijrrmitted to break down a door, Cap
tain Duke ordered one of the officers
to break down the barricade.
The women were subsequently re
leased upon a $150 bond on each charge.

lather Nolan Says Kniigration
to America is Menacing the
Future of the Emerald Isle
Re\. Father John Nolan of Belfast,
Ireland, .arrived on a belated train from
the East last nisht and is registered at
the Palace Hotel. The clergyman is
making a tour of the United States, de
livering lectures on Ireland for the pur
pose of raising funds for a Catholic
mission convenient to the city of Bel
fast, and during his stay in this city
he expects V> speak several times. He
is also representing the Irish Anti-Emi T
gration > League, which' has been' or
ganized in the Emerald Isle for the
purpose of discouraging Irishmen from
emigrating to this country. Discussing
this mission last evening Father Nolan
said: *':
Ireland has.. suffered greatly in . the last few
years by the enormous loss of ulation ; du-
10. the emigration of her people .to." this
country. Lai year 50.C00 people between ' the
ages of IS and 34 years jrmrn'ye'l from' the
eld country to .'America, and statistics show
that our country has loft exactly half of â¢Us
population or 4.000,000 people.' who have set
tled Â¦ here. The " depletion of - our . native
strength lias given much . concern to â¢'. us at
liome, and : the people, assisted by the, Bishops
and other leading > members of the church.
have undertaken a plan ' to : etcm the . tide -i of
-migration. "While we recognize the United
States a- a jrreat country.- yet we feel that
Ireland " has already grlven â¢If a fair share at
It* people and the rest < should remain at home

their own nation. Â¦ - â¢ Â¦

at Ireland that conditions have to chanced

they have to endure severer Â¦ weather than at

opportunities -to the struggling " people, so
that they may more ' readily improve their
conditions in life and -materially "improve the
land which gave them birth. Of course, .we
appreciate the fact that the United States.
with its great ' wealth and resources, 'has
m,any allurements for the -ambitious Irishman.
Too many of our people, however, \ think that
they can come to this country and quickly
become millionaires, ' which, of : course, -is an
erroneous idea, and one that 'they, do not
realize until, they are settled here and enter
upon the great struggle. What we are anxious
to accomplish is tho. destruction -Â¦ of Â¦ "these
delusions, and the newly, organized league has
entered upon this work - with great hopes. r '- r :-l

The Great Sale That People in This
City Talk About.
It seems that the city and entire State
is interested in the great retiring sale
of the Pattosien Company's big Furni
ture House, corner Sixteenth and Mission
streets.
In spite of the heavy rain the store
was crowded with buyers and the doors
liJid to be closed again on Saturday, be
cause the shipping department was be
hind in delivering goods. â¢ More wagons
have been ensugod for next week, and n
more prompt delivery can be promised
hereafter. It is understood that the sale
will hardly last two months longer. *
Rob a Gambling Joint.
Six Chinese robbed a Chinese gam
bling joint at the corner of Waverly
place and Washington street of $70
shortly after 10 o'clock last evening.
One oÂ£ the thieves, S<?e Sin Cook, while
attempting to escape was captured by
Sergeant Christiansen and Officers
Groat, Cannon and McGee. The six
thieves v.ere engaged in the game,
when two of them seized the coin that
lay on the table and with their com
panions started for the door. An alarm
was given and See Sin Cook captured.
Detectives were placed on the case and
are endeavoring to locate the other
men, whose names are in their posses
sion.
GERMAN OFFICE!!* AND THE
CADETS ARE ENTERTAINED

Residence of Ixniis Roesch on
Howard Street.
The officers and the cadets of the
German sehoolship Herzogin Cecilie,
Captain Max Dietrich, were entertain
ed last evening in the residence of
Louis Roesch, 2513 Howard street.
The magnificent parlors of the spa
cious mansion were very tastefully
decorated. In addition to the special
guests there were a number of the
prominent members of the German
colony present.*
The guests were welcomed by a
song written by Charles Bundschu,
which was followed by "A Song of the
Golden Gate," composed by H.
Glauch. Then followed an interest
ing programme of instrumental and
vocal selections, eighteen in number,
including orchestral music by the ca
dets' orchestra.
There was presented to each person
a handsome souvenir of the occasion
â an album, on the face of which is
an embossed representation .of the
statue representing Germany, while

of the evening, photographs of the
residence of the entertainer, of San
Francisco in 1849 and in 1904, of the
Golden Gate, of the Goethe-Schiller

pital, also the words of the songs.
