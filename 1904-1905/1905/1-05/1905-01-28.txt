With Remarkable Vigor.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan.
27.âGeneral Kuropatkin re
ports that Russian troops at
7 p. m. on January 26, after
a desperate light, occupied
the village of Sandepas,
nvhich had been strongly for
tified by the Japanese.
CHICAGO, Jan. 27.âThe Daily News
to-night publishes a cablegram from
Its correspondent with General Kuro
patkin's army, near Mukden, dated to
day, reading as follows:
"Kuropatkin began his long-expected
attack on Oyama's position yesterday.
The engagement was heralded by a ter
rific bambardment from strong bat
teries massed in the center of the Rus
sian lines. Gradually the fire was taken
up by the entire Russian front and
every battery was soon engaged. The
cannonading was terrific. Its reverbera
tions were felt at Mukden.
cover of this heavy fire the
troops advanced to attack.
They showed great enthusiasm and
pressed the assault with remarkable
vigor. The men suffered badly from
the weather, which is intensely cold,
the thermometer showing several de
grees below zero. The attack was made
in the midst of a blinding snowstorm.
The Japanese were quick in their an
swer to the Russian advance."
KUROPATKIN IS AGGRESSIVE.
Latest Dispatches Show That He Is
Following Up His Victory.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 28.âNews
of General Kuropatkin's successful
repulse of the Japanese advance
comes most opportunely.
The belief exists that Field Marshal
Oyama sought to take advantage of
any depression prevailing in the Rus
sian ranks as the result of the news
from St. Petersburg to launch an at
tack against General Kuropatkin's
right; but the Russian commander in
chief seems to have turned the tables,
Inflicting considerable loss on the
Japanese on Thursday and taking
several positions westward along the
Hun River.
Evidently General Kuropatkin is
following up his victory, the latest
dispatches from the* front, dated 6
o'clock in the evening of January 27,
Indicating that there is a battle in
. progress extending along the center
and becoming more and more serious.
However, it seems to be confined to
artillery.
If the fighting develops into a gen
eral engagement military men be
lieve that it must reach out to the
flanks, their opinion being that a
frontal attack by either side under the
present circumstances is impossible.
The authorities are receiving the
news from the front with great sat
isfaction, being convinced that it will
â erve at least partly to draw atten
tion from the strike and internal af
fairs generally.
JAPANESE ARE BAYONETED.
Russians Occupy Khailatosa Without
Firing a Single Shot.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 27.âGeneral
Kuropatkin, under date of January 25,
telegraphs as follows to Emperor Nich
olas:
"The advance of our right flank
against the enemy has commenced. We
have occupied Khailatosa and Khei
goutaya."
General Kuropatkin adds:
"No details have been received of the
losses at Khailatosa and Kheigoutaya,
which are seven versts southwest of
.Sandepas. We occupied Khaliatosa
without firing, the Japanese being
bayoneted. Kheigoutaya was bravely
defended, but we finally occupied it at
10 o'clock at night. Our cavalry pur
sued two regiments of Japanese dra
goons, which fled southeastward.
"On our left flank a detachment re
pulsed, the Japanese and occupied a de
file between Khandiensan and Expan
san. Another detachment sent against
the enemy's flank near Hindkecheng
forced the Japanese to retire and cap
tured 200 cattle."
Supplementing the foregoing General
Kuropatkin says:
' "From later reports it appears that in
.capturing these positions we made pris
oners of 100 Japanese. We also occu
pied the village of Weheitailse, on the
Hun River, losing fifty men. Op Janu
ary 26 our troops continued the offen
sive against Sandepas. The Japanese
attacked our positions near the village
from the south and southeast, but were
repulsed. Our cavalry participated,
â  maneuvering against the left flank and
attacking the Japanese in the rear.
Our force then attacked Sandepas, and
at 7 p. m., after a desperate fight, with
the assistance of sappers, we surmount.

WARSAW, Russia, Jan. 27.âA strike
was started here to-day and spread
rapidly. A number of factories are
now closed.
A collision between troops and strik
ers occurred in Leszno street to-day, in
which the military used their arms.
It is officially stated that the cas
ualties were two killed and seven

The strikers invaded the Wolski sub
urb and broke into liquor shops. There
was a. sharp encounter with the police.
MITAU, Russia, Jan. 27.âLabor
agents from Riga organized a strike
here to-day. Bodies of strikers
marched to the factories and work
shops and compelled the men at work
to "leave their employment. Troops
were summoned to the scene of the dis
turbance and the strikers were dis
persed peaceably. The troops, with the
exception of a few patrols in the
streets-, returned to their bar
racks.
LODZ, Russia, Jan. 27.âA general
strike has commenced here.
Strikers Accept the Promises Made by
the Government.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 28, 3 a. m.â
A special council was held yesterday at
Tsarskoe-Selo, at which, it is reported,
various conciliatory measures were de
cided on, but no details have yet tran
spired.
Emperor Nicholas gave a luncheon
yesterday at Tsarskoe-Selo in honor of
the birthday of Emperor William of
Germany. The Empress, the Dowager
Empress, the German Embassador,
Count Lamsdorff and Mr. Witte were
present.
The strike continues at Sarafoff,
Kharkoff and Lodz. No papers have
appeared in any of these cities. At
Warsaw the situation appears to be
becoming worse. The strike is rapidly
spreading, shops have been closed,
there are no newspapers and telephone
service has been stopped.
In St. Petersburg there is no longer
any doubt that the strike is broken.
Fourteen establishments, including the
Franco-Russian, Aboukoff, Baltic, Rus
so-American Rubber Company and the
Ropes American Refinery already have
resumed and an entire starting up of
factories seems to be assured for next
Monday.
The men who are returning to work
are not asking conditions of the em
ployers. They have seemingly turned
their backs on political agitators and
accepted the Government's promises in
the matter of shorter hours and an
equitable adjustment of their griev
ances at their face value.
That the Government proposes to
compel the masters to settle upon the
Government's terms is plainly evi
denced by Finance Minister Kokovos
off's response yesterday to a deputation
of masters to whom he announced the
Government's decision, after an impar
tial investigation of both sides of the
controversy, to carry out the letter and
spirit of the proclamation of January
25. To the masters this means that
they will have to foot the bills.
Most Russian newspapers which will
appear to-day have decided, inasmuch
as they will not be permitted to pub
lish full and uncensored accounts of
the events of the last few days, to print
only the official statement. It? is said
that the authorities say the censorship
will be relieved as soon as the situation
again becomes normal.
A Russian Journalist says that Father
Gopon told him Saturday night that
the time had come when he could take
off the mask and declare himself a So
cialist. He said he knew the Emperor
would not be at the Winter Palace on
Sunday to meet the workmen and that
he knew the troops would fire, although
he had preached the contrary at the
workmen's meetings. The object,
Father Gopon is reported to have said,
was to open the eyes of the workmen
and turn them into revolutionists.
Father Gopon's whereabouts is not
definitely established, although he is
said to be in the Shafoufofsky Hospital j
wounded.

CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING-,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.âThe Califor
nia delegation in Congress was taken
by surprise to-day by the peremptory
cutting out from the naval appropria
tion bill, now being framed in commit
tee, of the item providing for equip
ment for Mare Island Navy Yard for
building ships.
At the last session a bill introduced
by Senator Perkins became a law,
providing that two. colliers, the con
struction of which was deemed neces
sary, be built in the navy yards rather
than by private contract, one on the
Atlantic and the other on the Pacific
Coast. It then became necessary to
equip Mare Island with tools for the
work and an appropriation of $200,000
was asked for the purpose. The item
failed at the last session and has this
year been attacked by the head of the
Bureau of Construction and Repafr and
now by Secretary Morton himself. The
Secretary declares in favor of private
contract for this work on the Pacific
Coast.
Meantime the collier designated for
the Atlantic coast is well on toward
completion at the Brooklyn Navy
Yard. The law passed at the last sea>
sion is thus made inoperative only so
far as ft applies to the Pacific fttftst,
through the lack of an appropriation
to carry It out.
Senator Perkins will make an at
tempt to have the item Inserted in the
bill by an amendment on the floor of
the Senate. Senator Perkins and Rep
resentative Knowland will see the
President about the matter to-morrow.

CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.â1n anticipa
tion of a revolution when the United
States spreads its fiscal protectorate
over Santo Domingo, the Navy ( De
partment is drawing a strong cordon
of ships about the black republic.
Although it is officially stated that
200 marines under Captains Berkeley
and Hirschlinger embarked on the
United States ship Dixie at Colon yes
terday to proceed only to Guantanamo,
this movement is part of the precau
tionary measures taken in support of
the new American policy in Santo Do
mingo. There are 300 marines avail
able in Porto Rico. Santo Domingo
city is only one day distant from
Guantanamo and the Dixie will
marines wherever needed on an in
stant's notice.
There are now at least six Ameri
can warships in Dominican waters,
the Newark, the llagship of Rear Ad
miral Sigsbee, commanding the Car
ibbean squadron; the Tacoma, Stew
art, Detroit, Castine and Sterling.
War time secrecy envelops the move
ments of these ships. The Navy De
partment publishes a dally list of ship
movements reported to the depart
ment.
The marines on the Dixie will be used
if any demonstration is made against
American interests. It is known that
Dominican leaders, who have been en
joying the customs "graft" at various
ports, are enraged at the prospect of J
these prolific sources of revenue pass
ing into the control of Americans, who
will permit no "graft."
Secretary Hay has written to the j
Senate Committee on Foreign Rela- I
tions that he will in a few days trans- i
mit the agreement with President |
Morales. IV transpires that Santo Do- j
mingo has for some time expressed a!
desire to be under the protecting wing i
of the United States, and offered the
United States a coaling station in Sa
mana Bay as an inducement.
The Navy Department this morning:
Issued the following statement:
On January 1U orders were issued to Rear
Admiral Sigsbee authorizing him to send the
Dixie with 200 marines from Panama to
Guantanamo. where they will be held in read
iness for use elsewhere. No other orders have
bter. Issued to the Dixie, no hurry orders of
any kind and so far as the Navy Department
knows there are no disturbances in Santo
Domingo. This leaves 390 marines on the
isthmus.

Marquam, one of Portland's largest of
fice buildings, is in imminent danger
of destruction. Tenants have all day
long been receiving shocks estimated
at from twenty-five to fifty volts, and
are terror-stricken. The fear of fire
is now uppermost, for In the opinion
of electrical experts there is no cause
of alarm from the electric voltage,
which is not great. The trouble is ap
parently in the basement, just where
has not yet been determined.
The iron steps leading to the Ore
gon Savings Bank, on the ground
floor of the Marquam. have become
charged, and the bewildered look of
persons having business with the bank
when they felt the shock was a source
of much merriment to a large crowd
that congregated at a safe distance
from the Marquam.

It was said to-day in connection with

the health of the chief executive when
the toast was proposed. Asked regard

"Toasts were drunk to everything

may have been that a toast to Presi

do not remember that it was. I would
certainly not have responded to it after
the villainous attack he has made on
my father."
Mrs. Hayes added that while she
would not drink to a toast offered to
President Roosevelt, on the other hand
she would decline in an unobtrusive

The Chicago police
are putting forth every
effort to locate John
Hoch, the modern Blue
beard, who in fhe past
ten years has had thirteen
wives. Shortly after mar
riage, each one of Hoch's
wives has disappeared in
a mysterious manner. It
is the belief of the officers
that Hoch has done away
with them after securing
their property. One
theory connects the miss
ing man with the notori
ous Holmes of Philadel
phia, who was hanged
ten years ago.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. 27.âEquipped with
funds to the extent of thousands of
dollars, which he is accused of having
secured from his long list of wives,
John Hoch is now believed to have
reached the Atlantic coast at least, if
he has not already succeeded in laying
some hundreds of miles of the Atlan
tic Ocean between himself and the po
lice.
According to information received by
the police this evening, a man answer
ing Hoch's description applied for a
steerage ticket at an Atlantic coast
town, but failed to return for It later,
as he promised to do. It is said that
afternoon copies of the rogues' gal
lery pictures of Hoch and a list of his
wives appeared in the papers of the
town and it is believed the fugitive
did not venture to call for his ticket,
although he paid a small deposit on it.
The entire Atlantic coast is being
searched for the man.
Flushing, Holland, one of the few
points through which any one can en
ter Germany without a passport or
even identification papers, because of
the Custom-house officers, Is being
closely watched for /the man who has
had thirteen wives.
The man the people of half a dozen
small towns near Argos, Ind., suspect
ed was John Hoch was arrested to-day
at Burkett, Ind., and taken to Argos.
He said he was Adolph Steinbaum and
had never heard of Hoch. The pris
oner, it is said, does not resemble
Hoch.
The police are also working upon the
theory that Hoch is being kept In hid
ing by some one of the women with
whom he had been associated. His past
is being traced in a search for some
woman who might be interested in
shielding him.
The whereabouts of Police Inspector
Shippey, who has taken active charge
of, the search for Hoch, is a mystery to
all except Chief of Police O'Neill. In
spector Shippey has not been seen by
his friends since he left the station in
disguise on Thursday. It is asserted
that Shippey has trailed Hoch to some
small town not far from Chicago.
The police in tracing Hoch's record
have learned that in addition to having
had thirteen wives he served a term in
the County Jail for selling mortgaged
furniture.
PHILADELPHIA. Jan. 27.âDetective
Frank Geyer, who arrested H. M. Mud
gett, alias H. H. Holmes, the man who
was hanged about ten years ago, does
not believe that Hoch, for whom the
Chicago police are searching, was in
any way connected with the murders
of which Holmes was accused.
"In Holmes' confessions he mentioned
some one with a name like that," the
detective said to-day, "but that was a
myth. Holmes always worked alone,
and in all our search we never found
even the slightest intimation that he
had an accomplice. Holmes trusted no
one but himself. Besides, the descrip
tion of the man wanted in Chicago tal
lies in no way with the mythical person
Holmes described."

VENTURA, Jan. 27.âThere is a

this end of the State. Superintendent
Shlndler and George E. Pillsbury of

It is believed it is their intention to

own lands suitable for the erection
of a power-house and depot. Hunting

NORTH SEA INQUIRY.
Commission Takes the Testimony of
Several Fishermen.
PARIS, Jan. 27. âAt to-day's session
of the International Commission in
quiring into the North Sea incident
counsel for Great Britain said he de
sired to secure the testimony of a wit
ness/named Fletcher concerning the ac
tion; .uf two Russian agents in seeking
information among the fishermen at
Hull.
Hugh O'Beorne, first secretary of the
.British Embassy at Paris and agent of
threat. Britain before the commission,
said: "We consider the action of agents
to be blameworthy, but we have not
heard that these agents acted under or
ders from the Russian Government."
M. Nekliedoff, in behalf of Russia,
raised the question whether such evi
dence bore upon the issue before the
commission.
. O'Beorne maintained that it would
.'explain the evidence of some Of the
.fishermen.
Admiral Fournier (France) ruled that
the commission would privately consid
er the question, in the meantime hear
ing, other witnesses. The latter then
continued their testimony, which was
:practically the same as that of the
preceding witnesses.
. 'A. witness named Brooks testified
that, he noticed, while escaping out of
the range of the Russian lire, a big
vessel resembling a merchantman, but
he was unable to give an exact descrip
tion t>f the ship. Answering a question
by Rear Admiral Davis, the witness
said that the vessel carried ordinary
merchantman's lights.
REFUGEES REACH CHEFU.
Suffer Severely From Exposure After
Leaving Port Arthur.
CHEFU, Jan. 27.âAfter battling for
seven days against contrary winds,
which assumed the proportions of a
blizzard, four junks from Port Arthur
with 170 Russian refugees reached
Chefu to-day. The Russians suffered
severely from exposure, but there were
no fatalities among them.
Some 2000 Russian refugees are now
living' on board the British steamer
Muenchen, which has been chartered
by the Russian Government to take
them home. About 500 others are quar
tered on shore and are being fed at the
expense of the Emperor of Russia,
Soajie of the junks which left Port
Arthur and encountered the gale, and
for the safety of which fears were ex
pressed, put back to Pigeon Bay. All
o{ them have now been accounted for.
A dispatch from Chefu January 23 re
porting the arrival of thirteen junks
with refugees from Port Arthur said
that eleven other junks were expected,
but- that owing to a high gale then pre
vailing there was considerable anxiety
regarding their safety and that steam
ers were scouring the sea for them. As
the foregoing dispatch indicates, all
these junks have now been accounted
for.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, Jan. 27.âThe owners of the
property at Tallac and the icemen
along the Truckee River are at sword's
pointa over the question of opening the
gates In the dam at the mouth of the
Truckee River and trouble is expected.
The hotel men have threatened to open

threat.
The waters of Lake Tahoe are rising
rapidly on account of melting snow on

at Tallac fear that the hotel and other

Russian Liberal Expects the Terror
ists to Take Vengeance.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 28.âOne of
the best posted and most .famous of
the Russian Liberals said last night:
While the events of last Sunday j
have given an enormous imnetus
throughout Russia to all movements
against the existing order of things,
it is truly marvelous with what skill
and adroitness the Government seems
to be turning the situation to its own !
account with the very men who have 1
suffered and who less than a week ago j
would have been in open revolt had
they been able to procure arms.
"The Government's proclamation ap
pealed to the workmen always to look
to the Government for redress of their
grievances, reinforcing this proclama
tion with quiet missionary work with j
such agencies as the Government j
knows so well how to employ to con
vince them that the bloodshed and mis- ]
cry brought down upon them Sunday :
was the result of listening to student 1
agitators and revolutionaries, and the
Government's ill-wishers generally; i
and the Government's plan has evident
ly been successful with the vast ma- j
jority.
"Outside of Father Gopon's organ- \
ization of a few thousand workmen the j
people knew little and cared less for
political aspirations. Their sole idea
was to improve the miserable lot of
themselves and their families; but their
imaginations were Btirred by the ora
tor's idea of an appeal direct to the
Emperor, and they joined the move
ment with enthusiasm.
"Strikes will sweep over Russia like
a wave, but there will be no revolution:
the conditions are not yet ripe. It is
only a spasm, a convulsion of greater
or less duration in different places, ac
companied by disorders and perhaps by
bloodshed. It will subside, temporarily
at least, and reappear in some other
form. A movement of which I have
received Information and which Is
Agrarian in character, already is afoot
in the province of Kiev. I expect its
extension in the spring throughout
Central Russia. It is a protest of ig
norant peasants against a miserable
existence and Is ; directed, blindly
.against the .feonie *,of whom
are striving earnestlyro help them. It
is similar to the movement in the
provinces of Poltava and Kharkoff
three years ago, when the peasants at
tacked the landlords, burned their
property and robbed and often killed
them, and possibly it may create a
similar reign of terror in country re
gions. The Government's embarrass
ment will go on and the autocracy will
fight inch by inch, but it will be
forced to give way, as It has done here
whenever too hard pressed, until final
ly the contest will end In the granting
of a constitution or a revolution will
overtake it."
"What of the immediate future?"
was asked.
"Rombs," was the reply. "The ter
rorists will begin to take vengeance."

EXPOSITION
FOR PARIS
IN 1920
PARIS, Jan. 27.â1n the Chamber of
Deputies to-day the Commerce com
mittee reported the Government prop
osition to create a universal exposition
Jn Paris in 1920 to commemorate the
foundation of the French republic.
During the debate on the general pol
icy of the Government, Rouvler said,
relative to the separation of church and
state:
"Separation was not a part of the
original programme of the Combes
Cabinet, but only arose through special
circumstances. If separation is made,
it is well we should understand it thus.
While reserving the rights of the state
and representing liberty of conscience
of Catholics, we would like to accom
plish it with unanimity. The Govern
ment will not oppose the separation,
but it is best first to discuss the income
tax."
After a spirited debate with reference
to secret reports, Berteaux, Minister of
War, defended the dismissal of officers,
which, he said, was necessary in the
interest of discipline.
M. Delcasse, amid constant interrup
tions from Socialist members, replied
to criticisms of the Government's atti
tude regarding the Franco-Russian al
liance, contending that It had been
greatly beneficial to France. '
A motion the debate on sepa
ration of church and state immediately
after the income tax was rejected by a
vote of 425 to 61.
Sarrien then presented a general vote
of confidence that the Government
would realise the reforms declared in
the programme announced by Premier
Rouvler, which was carried, 410 to 107.
The result is a distinct success for the
Ministry.

Slaying a Saloon Man
and Two Dealers.
Tragedy Follows Discharge of Game
ster Accused of Cheating by
rations of Resort.
NOGAL.ES, Ariz., Jan. 27.âFerdinand
Walters, a gambler, early to-day shot
and killed in the Palace saloon and
gambling house M. M. Conn, proprietor
oL the place; J. J. Johnson, a gambler,
and Modesto Olivas, a Mexican card
dealer, and then turned his revolver on
himself, sending a bullet through his
brain.
Accounts of the unusual tragedy dif
fer in detail. Walters, who was known
in the Southwest as the "Catalina Kid,"
had been engaged by Conn to conduct a
pokâ¬r game in his house. A few days
ago complaint was made by the patrons
of the resort that Walters had been
using marked cards to win their money,
and on Wednesday night Walters was
discharged. He remarked to the man
who took his place that there probably
would be some dead men around there
before long.
j Shortly before 4 o'clock this morning
I Walters strolled casually Into the Pal
! ace and ordered something to eat. Hav
ing finished his meal he walked leisure
-1 ly dp to the bar, where Johnson, known
;as "Cowboy" Johnson, was taking a
! drink. Without a word of warning
; Walters drew a revolver and fired at
Johnson from a distance of four feet.
The bullet struck Johnson squarely be
twen the eyes, killing him instantly.
So close was the range that the vic
tim's face was badly powder burned.
The report of the revolver drew Pro
prietor Conn to the scene. Stepping to
..the middle of the room Walters fired at
Conn as he entered the door, the bullet
striking him Just back of the left ear.
Con fell dead where he had stood.
The, murderer then turned about and
fired at George Spindle, who sat next
to Olivas, the "monte" dealer. The bul
let passed through the rim of Spindle's
hat and struck Olivas in the left side,
producing a wound from which the lat
ter succumbed a few moments later.
Having completed his murderous
work, Walters strode toward the front !
door, stepping over the prostrate forms j
of Conn and Johnson and made his way '
to the middle of the street. In the
meantime there was a panic among the
occupants of the place. Dave Black, as
soon as the shooting began, ran out the i
side door and secured a revolver. He
returned just as Walters had complet- j
ed his killing and emerged Into the f
street. Black raised his revolver to fire
at the murderer, but before he could j
act Walters placed his weapon to his
own head and sent a bullet through his j
brain.
Only four shots were fired and each
had taken a life and so quickly was
the tragedy enacted that hardly a min
ute elapsed between the first shot,
which took the life of Johnson, and the
last one, with which the murderer blew
out his own brains.
M. M. Conn was well known over
Arizona He had been engaged In the
liquor business in this Territory for
twenty years. He was a man of family
and of considerable means. Walters
was 28 years old and had traveled ex
tensively. In 1897 he was in Skagway,
Alaska, and It is said was a member
of the notorious "Soapy" Smith gang.
He was also well known in Dawson,
Cape Nome, San Francisco and Los
Angeles.

manager of the Bull Frog Mining Com
pany, was shot and mortally wounded
at Royolite, near Goldfleld, by "Tom"

threats of lynching have been made
against his assailant.
The two men were drinking together

MINE OWNERS OF GERMANY
SHOW SIGNS OF WEAKENING
Said to Have Modified Their Position
In Connection With the Coal
Strike.
ESSEN, Prussia. Jan. 27.âThe coal
mine owners object to their resolution
of yesterday, wherein they agreed to
accept the judgment of the Govern
ment commission on the workmen's
complaints, being interpreted as a
change from their previous attitude or
as any acknowledgment that the work
men are In the right. The Mine Own
ers' Association desired by the resolu
tion to clear away public misunder
standing and to repeat the assurances
the association had already given that
its members so fully believed In the
soundness of their position that they
are willing to abide by the Govern
ment commission's decision.
Notwithstanding this explanation, it
is very well known that the mine own
ers have modified their stiff position
and recognize that they are unable to
maintain an uncompromising attitude
against the Government and pubjic
opinion. Although this is the situation,
it will take much time to effect an
actual settlement.
LESS HARSH ON CLERGY.
Vatican's Opinion of Policy of Rou
vler of France.
ROME, Jan. 27.âPremier Rou

new French Cabinet has produced a
moderately favorable impression at
the Vatican and it is felt that the
course of the French Government to
ward the religious associations will be
less harsh than under the Combes
Cabinet.
At the same time it is believed that
when the time comes for general
elections, Catholics will be, directed to
support the more moderate element
of the majority, In order to defeat So
cialist candidates and that by this
means the Government will be in
duced to adopt a more favorable atti
tude toward the church. This, it is
pointed out, would be an attempt to
repeat in France the policy followed
successfully in Italy during the gen
eral elections last September. . s

WHO ARE TRYING TO CONVICT
HIM OF MURDER.
AUBURN, Jan. 27.âThe Weber trag
edy is the sole topic of conversation
here to-day. Three more jurors, Dewitt
Porter, J. H. Chubb and William Phil
lips, were secured to-day, making a
total of five. Twenty men have been
examined as to their fitness to serve.
Adolph Weber was in court during
the entire proceedings to-day. He ap
peared perfectly calm. When he en
tered he bowed in a friendly way to
those whom he knew and then took his
seat behind his counsel. He now wears
a white shirt and white collar in place
of the black sweater he wore during
the preliminary examination. As usual,
the courtroom was crowded.
Mrs. Snowden. sister of the murdered
woman, was not present at either of
the sessions of the court to-day. She
is now nearly beside herself with grief.
She said this afternoon:
"Life here in Auburn is now almost
unbearable to me. Wherever I go I see
the picture of my murdered sister. I
shall never be able to live here in peace.
I want my husband to sell our home
and then move away from the scene of
the awful tragedy."
The following talesmen will be
brought into court to-morrow morning
for examination as to their qualification
to serve as jurors: J. H. Rode, D. J.
Chamberlain, W. F. Dependener, Frank
Dowd. William Ragsdale, John Doyle
and James Doherty.
The defense has used six of its per
emptory challenges and the prosecution
five. Talesmen living in or near Auburn
are, as a rule, disqualified because they
have formed opinions in the case. It is
expected that the jury will be com
pleted without summoning an extra
venire.
Young Weber follows the questions
put to the talesmen and their answers
very closely. An expression of an opin
ion that he is guilty brings a slight
flush to his cheek, but otherwise he dis
plays no feeling. He take* copious notes
and often makes suggestions to his
counsel.

Salt Lake Railroad. All the indict
ments against Diss charge him with
obtaining money by false pretenses
and conspiring with Hays.

START SEARCH
FOR A FORTUNE
Citizens of Sutter County
Begin Quest of Gold Hid
den. It Js Said, Years Ago
MARYSVILLE. Jan. 27.âSearch was
commenced to-day by a number of res
idents of Nicolaus, Sutter County, for
a quantity of gold supposed to have
been buried at the roots of a sycamore
tree on the Erich farm near that town
about fifty years ago, when gold min
ing was at-its height.
In early days two miners, who had
been successful in the pursuit of riches,
started from Browns Valley for Sacra
mento, carrying several bags contain
ing nuggets and gold dust. They lost
their bearings and wandered to the
Sacramento River at Nlcolaus. There
they learned that they were being fol
lowed by an outlaw, whose intention
was to rob them. Not willing to give
up the treasure, they concluded to out
wit their pursuer by burying the gold.
They did so, and the next morning con
tinued on their Journey to Sacramento.
Before reaching that city, however,
they were overtaken by the outlaw,
and in the fight that ensued the robber
was killed and one of the miners was
badly wounded.
After " reaching Sacramento the
wounded man succumbed to his injur
ies and was buried by his partner. The
latter after a few days started back
to Nlcolaus in search of the treasure.
He was unable to locate the hiding
place, and after spending time and
money in a fruitless search returned
to the mining district. While at Browns
.Valley he was taken sick and died. Be
fore passing away he told his nurse
of the adventure with the robber and
of the buried gold. The names of both
men were long ago forgotten, and it
whs only recently that the story was
repoated to those are now making
the search.
CRUISER NEW ORLEANS
ANCHORS OFF MARK ISLAND
Vessel Will Be Placed Out of Com
mission to Allow Making; of
Extensive Repairs.
VALLEJO, Jan. 27.âShortly before
noon to-day a trim looking; vessel fly
ing the American colors and a home
ward bOund pennant 550 feet long
steamed into this harbor. The craft is
the third rate protected cruiser New
Orleans, commanded by .Giles B. Har
ber. United States navy, from the Asi
atic station. She came to Mare Island
direct from sea. Having lef/ her bat
tery at Guam and the midway islands
she was unable to salute Admiral Mc-
Calla's flag as she steamed into port.
The New Orleans will be put out of
commission here and receive extensive
repairs. There are 150 men on board
who are to be sent East for discharge
from the service. The rest of the crew,
numbering more than 150 men, will be
transferred to the receiving ship Inde
pendence.
The, New Orleans, which is â¢of 3437
tons displacement, is credited with a
speed of twenty-two knots. She was
built by Armstrong Whitworth & Co.,
at Elswick, England, for the Brazilian
Government, but was bought at the
outbreak of the war with Spain by tÂ»e
United States. Her original name was
Amozonius.

CORBIN'S ARREST IS ORDERED
Building and Loan
Official Arouses
the Solons.
Sergeant at Arms of
Senate Is Given
New Duty.
Snecial Dispatch to The CalL
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 27.âSergeant
at Arms of the Senate Lou Martin
will go to San Francisco on Sunday
and return on the first train on Mon
day with William Corbin, secretary
and manager of the Continental Build
ing and Loan Association. After a
mild storm in the upper house this
morning it voted to issue a warrant for
Corbin's "arrest as provided in a resolu
tion presented by the Committee on
Commissions and Retrenchments.
When the resolution was presented
Bauer of San Francisco protested
against the issuance of the warrant,
saying that as the question was of such
serious import the Senate should wait
until all of Its Junketers have returned,
that a full house might pass upon the
question as to whether or not a war
rant should issue. Emmons opposed
Bauer's stand, however, saying that the
seriousness of the question as relating
to the arrest of Corbin was not bo seri
ous as that relating to the dignity of
the Senate, which had been offended
by Corbin when he failed to respond to
summons regularly issued.
The call for a vote on the resolution
developed an almost unanimous senti
ment In its favor, and the sergeant at
arms was directed to bring Corbin be
fore the bar.
The Committee on Commissions and
Retrenchments also filed its transcript
of testimony taken in the investigation
of the Bardwell-Ford syndicate of San
Francisco. The committee made no
findings, but will report them later.
They will be against the legitimacy of
the concern.
Senator Rush began the movement
toward the reclamation of the inun
dated lands of the Sacramento basin
this morning. He introduced a bill
first establishing reclamation districts
and secondly providing ways and
means for carrying on the work. His
measure provides for the levying of
an ad valorem tax on the State to
raise a fund each year sufficient to
balance any sum that may be appro
priated by the Federal Government for
the reclamation work. Another . bill
aims to appropriate $500,000 for the
beginning of the work, the same to
remain in the treasury, however, un
til the Federal Government appropri
ates an equal sum, both funds then to
be drawn upon, the ad valorem tax
being intended to keep up the work
until it is completed, at an estimated
cost of $24,000,000.
Senator Belshaw introduced a bill this
morning providing for the establish
ment of a State bureau of criminal iden
tification, the Same to be under the
management of a director to be ap
pointed by the State Board of Prison
Directors. The salary of the director
is fixed at $1800 a year.
Senator Shortridge tackled the auto
mobile question with a bill an inch
thick, the purpose of which is to reg
ulate the speed and other questions re
lating to these machines. A system of
State registry is provided for, but the
unique portion of the bill refers to
speed. It provides for the establish
ment of sign posts along county roads
telling wandering autoists what speed
they may maintain and on which side
of the road to keep.
Senator Simpson introduced a batch
of bills regulating the National Guam,
one of especial interest having appli
cation to a southern case in which a
young man lost his position because
he joined the militia and went into
camp with the troops. This bill makes
it a misdemeanor for any employer to
discriminate against any employe on
the ground that the latter is a mem
ber of the National Guard.

TWELVE HOURS
FIREMEN'S DAY
Senate Finally Passes the
Measure Despite Opposi
tion of Los Angeles Man
â¢
Special to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 27.âThe Senate
has finally decreed that the firemen
of Los Angeles, along with those of
San Francisco, shall not work lonsrer
than twelve hours a day. Wolfe's bill
limiting the hours of the San Francisco
boys, amended by Savage of San Pedro
to include .those of Los Angeles, is now
out of the upper house for good, hav
ing been passed the second time to-day
on reconsideration against the violent
opposition of Carter, who hails from
Los Angeles.
When the bill was passed yesterday
Carter asked for a reconsideration,
saying he had a letter from a member
of the Los Angeles department asking
him to work against the amendment
to the bill extending its provisions, to
the southern city. When it was reached
upon the file to-day Carter produced
another letter from the Mayor of Los
Angeles protesting against the bill
upon the ground that Los Anereles
could not stand the increased expense.
A call for a vote resulted in the de
feat of Carter, and the bill went out to
the House. Carter, it is said, will not
cease his opposition to the measure
until it finally goes to the Governor or
is beaten in the Assembly.
CORPORATIONS PROTEST.
Representatives of Building and Loan
Companies Before Committee.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 27.âThe As
sembly committee on building and loan
associations held a session to-night
that lasted until midnight. The bill
introduced by Amerige was discussed.
There were several representatives of
building and loan corporations present
and of these Clarence Grange and
Frank Otis of San Francisco took a
prominent part in the proceedings.
They disagreed on several points em
braced in the bill and exchanged a
number of sarcastic remarks. The
companies represented by them are
operating on somewhat different lines
and consequently the same legislation
did not exactly suit both In all in
stances. Senator Hahn, who is inter
ested in two building and loan com
panies in the southland, was present
and took an active part in the discus
sions. He favored the ideas advanced
by Grange.
At the outset Grange suggested an
amendment providing that no com
panies existing at the time it may be
come a law should be affected in cer
tain particulars by the bill under con
sideration. Express mention was made
of companies organized before 1891.
Grange said that Otis and others had
hoped to secure the pasage of the bill
without this provision.
From questions asked by members
of the committee, of whom there were
present Transue, Waste, Coghlan,
Chandler and Jury, it seems probabie
that besides adopting the suggestions
of the building and loan men they will
embody a few provisions of their own
in the measure that is agreed upon.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 27 âThe harbor
of San Pedro is still in its accustomed
location and the work on the Govern
ment breakwater there seems to be go
ing along well. The Chamber of Com
merce of Los Angeles thinks that when
this Government work is finished the
commerce of the southland will take a
great jump. All this Information wu
conveyed to the Assembly this morning;
by the report of the Committee on
Commerce and Navigation, through its
chairman, Assemblyman Gus Hartman
of San Francisco, the committee hav
ing finished its inspection of the Ban
Pedro harbor.
There was more to the report, but its
further reading was dispensed with on
motion of Stanton of Los Angeles, and
it was ordered printed in the Journal
that members might have time to pon
der over it at their leisure.
The Committee on Rules filed a re
port recommending the adoption of
Coghlan's resolution that the Commit
tee on Public Charities and Corrections
be granted permission to visit the two
State prisons and the Whittier and
Preston schools. Though Coghlan is
from San Francisco and chairman of
the committee, Anthony of San Fran
cisco was the only person to speak
against the adoption of the report. He
held that the visit was unnecessary,
as the State Board of Charities and
Corrections visited the institutions
quarterly. No one answered him and
the motion was adopted.
The drug clerks came near losing
their tight in the lower house for a ten
hour day. Enough of the interior mem
bers voted against the bill establishing
it whtn it came up for final passage
this morning to defeat it by one vote.
During a call of the absentees three
members changed their votes to aye
and the measure passed the House.
Bills 300 and 302, providing for the
enforcement in cities of the rules laid
down by the State Board of Health and
of the quarantine and disinfection laws
of the State, were passsed.
In speaking to the Los Angeles Judg
ship measure Houser said that three
more Judges were needed because dur
ing the last year the records showed
that SoO actions had been begun before
the six Judges now on the bench there.
The bill was passed, as also were the
measures providing for employes of the
District Courts of Appeals.
When Estudillo's bill for the recession
of the Yosemite Valley and the. Mari
posa Big Tree Grove was called, the
author submitted an amendment pro
viding that such recession should not'
affect any existing vested right. This
amendment covers all leases of hotels
and other concessions in the valley.
The bill was sent to the printer again
with the amendment and will be taken
up in the Assembly as a special order
next Wednesday morning, one day be
fore the Senate finally considers it.
McCartney's measure making it legal
for County Recorders to use typewrit

ments was also passed.

NEW FRIDAY NIGHT CLUB IS
SMART---VERY SMART.
Mrs. Inez Shorn White Proclaimed a Clever Leader
SALLY SHARP.
Hail to the Friday Night Cotillon!â
virile, interesting and novel as a new

White, the smart setâsuch of it as was
askedâpledged its unfaltering allegi

attendance at the dance.
Most of the members arrived earlyâ
this the worthy reform wrought by the
pluckly new leader, for which, say the
men who work for a living, "The gods
be praised!"

CHANGE IN WORKING
HOURS AT THE MINT
Department Orders That They Con
form to System in Other Insti
tutions It Controls.
The Treasury Department at Wash
ington has done away with an old
custom dating from the establishment ;
of the Mint in this city. It had been
the custom to allot the workmen in
the different departments a certain
amount of work, according to the de
mand for coinage, and when such al
lotment was completed the employes
were dismissed for the day.
the new order the workmen will be
required to remain on duty for eight
hours, from. 8 o'clock a. m. until 4
o'clock P- m.. with a half hour at mid- i
day for luncheon, and the' clerks will I
be required to be On duty from 9 1
o'clock a. m. until 4 o'clock p. m.
This order is not given to secure a
greater amount of work or a greater
number of hours from the workmen,
for when the Mint is busy, as it has
been for the last two or three years, '
few employes work less than. eight
hours. Its purpose is to have the
methods of employment conform to i
those existing in the other mints. The
order affects only those employes di
rectly engaged in the coinage work.

RARE VINTAGES
Fine Wines and Brandies of
Sixty Years Ago Found in
! Vault of Hawaiian Hotel
BUST COVEKS LABELS
Champagne Discovered of the
Quality Supplied to the
Royal Family in England
HONOLULU, Jan. 27.âWhen Man
ager Church took over the direction of
the Royal Hawaiian Hotel recently a
general cleaning up was the first duty.
In the dim recesses of the wine vaults
were found some bottles with the labels
so covered with dust that at first it was
supposed the bottles contained some
sort of liquors which had been declared
of no value.
Instead of a job lot of bottles fit only
for the garbage cart, It was found that
the Hawaiian cellars contained dozens
upon dozens of bottles of vintages
priceless and rare. There were famous
brandies of the vintages of 1840, 1850
and 1858, and champagne in double
magnums of the quality supplied to the
royal family of England. There was
also a flrfe assortment of claret, and
among the liqueurs were some whose
names read unfamiliarly now, so long
have they gone out of fashion.
TOMBS OF THIRTEENTH

Germany, and son of the Emperor
Henry VI. He reigned from 1215 to
1246, when he was deposed by his sub

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 27.âThe police

SEEK TO HIDE
BEHIND BOARD
Vaudeville Theaters Plead
That Condition Was Well
Known by the Officials
HEARING NOT ENDED
c
Architects to Be Called to
Prova That Ordinance Is
Impracticable and Void
Another futile effort on the part of
the District and City attorneys' offices,
representing the Grand Jury, the Police
Department and the Board of Public
Works, to bring about the hearing of
the injunction suits involving the clos
ing of four vaudeville theaters was had
in Judge Sea well's court yesterday. At
torney H. C. McPike, representing the
Baldwin Theater, was not prepared to
go on with the trial. Upon his repre
sentations his case and that of the Nov
elty, Unique and Homan's all went over
for another week. McPike announced
that he would attempt to break the or
dinance regarding theater construction
by producing "a horde of architects"
who would testify that the provisions
of the ordinance were Impracticable â
impossible to fulfillâand therefore that
the ordinance must be invalid. Judge
Seawell was In doubt as to the propri
ety of admitting such evidence in an
attack upon the validity of an ordi
nance, and he will pass upon it later,
but it was agreed that even if the evi
dence were proper the "horde" could
be dispensed with and two or three
such expert witnesses would serve the
purpose.
McPike read an affidavit made by
William Z. Tiffany, proprietor of the
Baldwin, in which a few of the allega
tions of the police were denied, but in
the main his defense consisted in the
pleading that the construction of the
place had been supervised by the Board
of Public Works, which had made
changes in the specifications and finally
granted a permit which included all of
the imperfections charged. This proved
that the Baldwin had practiced no
fraud.
District Attorney Byington was of
the opinion that the affidavit begged
every question advanced by those who
are seeking to close the unsafe amuse
ment places. He further argued that
the Board of Public Works had no
power to license a theater that had
not complied with all the terms of the
ordinance. He offered affidavits of
Foreman T. P. Andrews of the Grand
Jury reciting the specific instances
wherein the Novelty Theater violated
the ordinance, and Assistant City At
torney Partridge read the affidavits of
Aigeltinger and Eagan of the Board of
Public Works setting forth the short
comings of the Baldwin.
MISS HENRY SUES WHITTIER
FOR BREACH OF PROMISE
Demands $50,000 From Merchant for
His Alleged Failure to Keep
His Word.
The affair between Nellie T. Henry
and W. F. Whittier of the Whittier-
Fulier Company, of nearly fifteen years'
standing, which has been given to the
public heretofore with variations, de
veloped a new and probably final phase
yesterday, when the woman, by her at
torneys, Welles Whitmore and Howard
Piersol. filed a suit for $60,000 for breach
of promise against the merchant.
She alleges That at his solicitation she
promised to marry him on January 1,
1890, and that from then until March 1,
1903, he renewed his intention to wed
her on an average of once a month. On
the last named date he broke the en
gagement, says She, without provoca
tion. She is still single, she says, and
willing to marry him, and considers
that "a reasonable time has elapsed for
their marriage to take place."
Common sense is a safer bank ac
count than cents.

BROS.DOG'S TRICKS DECIDE HIS
DISPUTED OWNERSHIP.
Predilection Test Thwarted
by His Genial Nature.
Tail Wags Indiscriminately
Such a good-natured fox-terrier was
he and so indiscriminate in his be
stowals of fawning that it was impos
sible to decide the question of his
ownership by testing his predilection.
He played no favorites. Alfred Clark,
the bartender who claimed prior pro
prietorship, was the recipient of as
-many gladsome tail wags as were
aimed at Alvin Leopold, the shirt
cutter, who held the leash, and each
of the three lady witnesses was greeted
as if she were a long lost and still be
loved mistress.
"He's the most genia 4 dog I ever
saw," said Police Judge Cabaniss. "If
he were a seeker of political place and
we were unpledged voters he could not
express more Joy at being in our so
ciety. But his exuberance of spirit is
embarrassing in these premises."
"If I could sling the glad hand with
as much seeming sincerity as he swings
hip tail I'd be unbeatable in my dis
trict," sighed Clerk "Barney" Conlan.
' Then they applied the dental test,
Mr. Clark having alleged that the bone
' of contention was a five-year-old when
it strayed or was stolen from him two
years ago. while Mr. Leopold as stout
.ly maintained that it was a crawling
puppy when he adopted it two years
pro, its maternal relative being the
.property of a butcher, who would cor
roborate that statement. The cor
ridors were scoured in search of per
sons who could ascertain a dog's age
by examining its teeth and of the many
fanciers found no two agreed as to
the exact age of that particular dog,
although each gentleman was ready
to wager cash that hii guess was near
â¢ est to the mark. While the experts
were wrangling the happy thought
came to the Judge and he instantly
utilized it by asking Mr. Leopold if he
had taught the dog to perform feats
that do not come naturally to dogdom.
"Lots of 'em," replied Mr. Leopold.
"Rip sits up and begs and leaps
through a circle made by my arms and
does lots of other smart things. These
three ladies, neighbors of mine in the
800 block of McAllister street, have
seen him perform."
" 'Deed we have," the ladies ex
claimed in eager chorus. To which a
tall matron added her opinion that a
' cuter canine than Rip never existed,
while a buxom housewife pronounced
Rip "the cunnin'est dog alive."
.At the court's suggestion Rip was
put through his paces as beggar and
ring jumper, his clever performance
conveying great delight to the Leo
â¢ rnldites and corresponding depression
of mind to the Clark contingent, Mr.

Clark himself gloomily muttering that
may be Rip had learned those tricks
ere he entered the house of Leopold,
but Mr. Leopold and the feminine trio
proved that Rip's entire education was
conducted by them.
"That settles it," said the bench.
"There is an old and honored adage
to the effect that one cannot teach an
old dog new tricks and if this dog had
been aged when he fell into the hands
of Mr. Leopold that gentleman could
not have taught him the stunts which
h? has here performed. Therefore the
bulk of the evidence is in favor of Mr.
Leopold and to his custody the dog is
consigned by this court."
The ladies gleefully clapped their
hr.nds and embraced Rip, whose tail
was almost dislocated by his enthu
siastic response to their caresses.
Richard Dorsey, the putative sailor,
who played "Peeping Tom" and there
by, terrorized the nurses at the Cali
fornia Women's Hospital, was sent by
Judge Fritz to answer in the Superior
Court to the charge of attempt to
commit burglary.
Edward Savage, clothing salesman,
had read newspaper reports of the
raiding of disorderly houses by the po
lice, and curiosity prompted him to
visit a disreputable alley, where he was
arrested for loitering.
"I just went slumming for fun," he
pleaded to Judge Mogan.
"There's no fun in slumming if you
do it when you're not obliged to, and
still less when you are," was his Hon
or's response. "Go home and be grate
ful that necessity does not compel you
to slum."
a â¢ â¢
On the calendar he was registered as
John Markham, and to Judge Mogan
he said he was p. sailor.
"May I arsk im a question or two?"
inquired John Hart, able seaman
aboard the ship Alexander, who charged
the putative son of Neptune with hav
ing recklessly displayed a pistol on low
er Pacific street. Permission to inter
rogate was courteously awarded to Mr.
Hart, and turning to the defendant he
said:
"Neighbor, ye say ye're a sailor?"
"Dats vat I iss," was the answer.
"Now, neighbor, I know ye're lying.
'Cos why?' sez you. 'Cos,' sez I 'ye
know bloody well that sailors don't car
ry weppings that shoot. That's cos w'y,'
I sez. Then I sez, 'Neighbor, sailors
ain't allowed to have shootin' weppings
w'en they're at sea, an' they don't
spend their money for shootin' wep
pings w'en they comes ashore.' Then I
sez, 'Neighbor, all the bloomin' pay th'
sailor man gets he knoW3 wat to do
with, an' buying shootin' weppings
ain't one of the things he does. Neigh
bor, ye ain't no sailor, but a bloomin'
bluffer."
"Dis vay id vasâ"
"Neighbor, don't try to argify with
me, for ye can't do it without tellin'
more lies. Ye ain't no shipman, but a
bloomin' bluffer, 1 sez."
"Dis pisdol dot I â"
"Don't neighbor, don't try it, sez 1,
for ye never had a bloomin'â"
The court stopped the one-sided de
bate by taking upon itself the inetrro
gation, and without accusing Mr. Mark
ham of lying it elicited from him the
information that he was attached to no
ship, but had walked from San Jose
just prior to his arrest. Mr. Hart shook
his head warningly at the Judge to at
tach no credence to anything the de
fendant might say, a warning which
apparently was as unnecessary as it
was unheeded.
Hearing continued till to-day.

SAX FRANCISCO. Jan. 27, 1905.
Judge MoganâDear Sir: I asked to see you
this morning before court, but was told I could
not. Judge Mogan. I am not guilty. But It
you have to sentence me to prison I wish you
would make It '.one cnourh and s*nd me to
San Qj'.fntin. I know you will think It strange
me asking you this, but I would rather serve
a year In San Quentin. where I can have
plenty of frosh air, than a month In the
County Jail with the drunks. Hoping you
will do me this favor. If I am not discharged,
I am respectfully yours.
MRS. DOROTHY McCABE.
When she did appear in court Mrs.
McCabe exhibited unmistakable evi
dence of need of fresh air. Three
weeks' imprisonment had thinned and
sallowed her face and her tailor-made
costume hung loosely. Moreover, she
complained that the jail atmosphere
had afflicted her with frequent fainting
spells.
Representatives of the Emporium and
Weinstock, Lubln & Co., which firms
had received worthless checks from the
defendant, testified that they had no
desire to subject her to further pun
ishment, and an agent of Hale Brothers
reported that his employers would
probably instruct him to show similar
leniency to-day. So the case was
again continued, with the woman's
prospect of returning to freedom con
siderably brightened.
To each of her vi Urns she had given
a |50 check drawn . upon a San Ber
nardino bank, and a deposition from
the cashier stated that almost a year
ago she had deposited and soon after
ward withdrawn $20. that being the
only transaction she ever had with that
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, JANUARY 28, 1905.
MINING OF COAST
IS REVIEWED.
EXPERTS TELL OF ITS GROWTH
Progress Is Marked From Alaska
to the Mexican Boundary.
Considering the vast amount of capi
tal invested in the mining industry in
the United States, and the great value
of the annual output of all the varied
mines of this country, a general view of
the industry as a whole cannot fail to
be interesting at this early stage of
1905. Without giving up a great amount
of room to statistics, which have al
ready been summarized by the United
States Geological Survey, material
facts and specially those relating to the
Pacific Coast States and Territories are
germane.
Speaking first of the progress of the
leading metals, those that figure large
ly in the markets of the world, it may
be said that no unusual developments
in iron mining took place in any part
of the United States in 1904. There was
an increase in the gold production, and
there ought to be ah annual increase,
due to the fact that there are vast
mountain areas that remain practically
unexplored by the prospector; rich
desert regions, as demonstrated by the
discoveries of two years in Nevada,
where vast stores of the shining metal
unquestionably await discovery: the
newer processes promise as much as
discoveries by making it possible to get
profit from very how grade ores. Add
to this that dredger mining, which is
applicable to enormous areas where yet
that branch of industry has not been
introduced to date, and it will be seen
that hardly any prediction concerning
the progress of gold mining in this
country can be overwrought.
Copper remains a center of interest.
Great advances have been made in
Arizona in twelve months. The de
velopment of copper properties in this
State, those in Shasta County natur
ally attracting the lion's share of at
tention, together with the promise that
is reported to be held out in the opera
tions trf the plant that the Mountain
Copper Company is constructing in
Contra Costa County, where copper
matte may be refined instead of send
ing to the Eastâadd live Interest when
the situation is passed in review.
The silver mining industry has not
advanced materially in any part of the
United States in a year. The coal
mining industry of California has been
considered of less pressing importance
since the very large production of fuel
oil in this State made it possible to get
steam and other power at low cost. Oil
has largely interfered, also with the
importation of coal for steam making.
Still it is known that there are very
large coal deposits in California. There
is also a good showinp of iron ores in
certain California districts, but the
cost of coke has stood in the way of
smelting California iron, and may ma
terially interfere for some time to
come.
While dredger mining has so far ad
vanced in California as to be a lead
ing topic of conversation when practi
cal miners meet, the application of
electricity in quartz mining plants is
very important as a factor in the gen
eral advance. In an annual review of
the mining industry if this State in
connection with reviews of other parts
of the country, the Mining Wc-rld,
which is published at Chicago, gives up
much space to an article by State Min
eralogist Aubury. Therein, defending
the fame of California as a gold pro
ducing State, Aubury ( alls attention to
the fact that this State has to the end
of 1903 the sum of $1,395,377,212 in gold
to be credited to its mines and that the
annual yearly output for fifty-five
years has averaged more than $25,000,
--000. The statistics are so well under
stood at home that there is no need to
give much time to th'*ir consideration.
Aubury says on one topic:
VAST GOLDEN TERRITORY.
As to distribution of the gold deposits, aside
from their forms, it may he said that Califor
nia stretches through nin. and a half degrees
of latitude and between the extreme north
west and southeast conn's, the direct dis
tance being 778 miles, wh' c the width Is from
14R to 235 miles, the tots' area being 156,931
square miles. The great angc of the Sierra
Nevada runs through nearly the entire length
of the State, on the east *m border, and the
belt of the coast rangee '-order the sea coast
on the west. Along the r'ierra Nevada range
ami its foothills, and the northwestern coast
range, and the southeastern desert region in
the tier of counties extending from one end
of the State to the other, there is not a single
one without its gold deposit* in one form or
another. There is gold on .the ocean beaches of
the coast line, the mountain ranges, the root
bills, the valleys. Even J'ne sandy wastes of
the Vohave and Colorado- deserts have many
productive gold mines. In Inyo County there
are gold mines being worked at elevations of
9COO. ll.CttO. 1.1,000 and 13,500 feet, and in the
same county gold Is being taken out at placrs
over 200 feet below the level of the sea. It
Is thus seen that the gold deposit* of <*ali
fornle extend over a longitudinal area of 77"
milen. a lateral area of an average of 191 miles
(or extreme width of 235 miles), and a vertical
of 13.7C0 feet.
The following, also about mining for
gold with dredgers, is from Aubury s>
article in the Mining World:
Dredge mining is a comparatively new
branch of the gold mining industry of Califor
nia, it having been developed within the past
five years. It is very rapidly increasing in
importance. In 1002 the yield from
institution. Her mother declined to
come to her aid, preferring that the
young woman should suffer for the in
discretion into which she had been led
by her inordinate love of finery.

that source was $801,295, and in 1903 it was
$1.507.539âan increase of $706,244, or a gain
of 88.14 per cent in one year.
The yield for 1004 will prove to be very
much larger. In fact this Is now the most
rapidly advancing branch of the gold mining
Industry of the State. Lands available for
dredging are in great demand, and are being
diligently prospected In many of the coun
ties. Lands formerly unused, or used for grat
ing, etc., and with only nominal value, have
Jumped in price to $1000, $2000 and even $3000
per acre. The general average price is, how
ever, about $800 per acre. This class of min
ing has an advantage not common to others.
That is, one can tell before commencing active
operations Just about what yield to expect.
The tracts are first prospected by means of
Keystone drills, holes being sunk at many
places and the gravel brought up and care
iully sampled.
WORK IN ALASKAN FIELDS.
Alfred H. Brooks of the United States
Geological Survey in a report relative
to Alaska finds that the value of the
Alaskan gold output for 1904 was about
$9,000,000, of which the lode mines, prin
cipally the Treadwell, produced about
one-third.
"The placers of the Seward Penin
sula," writes Mr. Brooks, "contributed
between $4,000,000 and $4,500,000, the Yu
kon about $1,000,000, while the balance
ccmes from the smaller placer camps."
Alaskan lode mining, except for the
Treadwell group, is still unimportant,
but it is steadily developing. This
branch of mining is practically confined
to Southeastern Alaska. Relative to the
placer mining Mr. Brooks reports in
part:
The placers of Alaska produced between
$3,500,000 and $0,000,000. Of this about $4,~
500,(;uo came from the Seward Peninsula, $i.
--000,000 front tfce Yukon district and the bal
ance from the Cook Inlet. Copper River and
Juneau regions. Flacer mining In the Seward
I'cninsula was hampered by a dry season; work
by small operators was, in many Instances,
entirely interrupted, while none of the ditches
could furnish the expected supply of water.
In the entire peninsula there has been fever
ish activity In ditch construction; as a conse
quence, a number of ill conceived enterprises
have been inaugurated. Many appear to be
lieve that it is impossible to mine placers with
out ditches anil hydraulic elevators.
Mllea of ditches have been constructed for
the purpose of hydraullcklng shallow gravel
beds wMch could be more economically mined
by other methods. THie companies sufTer from
bad management; there are relatively few ex
perienced mining engineers In the entire dis
trict, fully 50 per cent of the enterprises being
in charge" of men who are utterly unfit; some
have come from the placer fields of California;
and these, when they have adapted themselves
to the new conditions, are usually succssful;
but large sums of money are being squandered
by men of no experience.
As the Seward Peninsula opens up, the ti as
portation problem becomes more serious. All
freight must be landed on the beach with
lighters at a cost of $5 per ton; while storms
often interrupt tratilc. During dry seasons it
is possible to haul good loads with horses to
almost any point in the peninsula, but a rainy
reason makes the country Impassable for wag
ons. The Nome Arctic Railway gives adequate
service to the creaks which it touches in its
nine miles of track. The Council City and
Solomon River Railway is steadily pushing its
construction Inland, and at the close of the
season had about sixteen miles of track com
pleted; this railway, when completed to Coun
cil, will open up a region well nigh inaccessi
ble under present conditions. The practice of
mining deeply buried pay streaks by drifting is
Increasing.
CALIFORNIA'S NEIGHBORS.
California's immediate neighbor on
the north, Oregon, enters the year with
a record of having made a greater sur
face equipment in 1904 than in any pre
ceding year. Twenty-five mines pro
vided new mills, eleven compressors
were installed, five large hydro-electric
plants were completed and two smelters
were finished and blown in. Placer op
erations have been extended, the dredg
ing Industry has added new machines
to its outfit and hydraulic work has
been extended to several new proper
ties.
The progress of Nevada has been
noted from time to time. W. J. Stone
ham reports as follows:
The statistics show that the production of
gold for r.W3 amounted to $3,388,000, and of
silver, $0,529,1139, the former metal showing an
increase of $492,700 and the latter an Increase
of $1.680.307 over the previous year. The pro
duction of 1904 amounted to, geld. $5,140,000;
silver, $4. ,V ,0,000. showing an Increase In gold
of $1,282,000 over 1903 and a decrease in silver
of over $2,000,000. While the total product is
trifling compared to the palmy days of the
Cumstock In the zenith of its glory, yet it is
the greatest output for many years and the
very remarkable percentage of Increase is the
most encouraging sign to those who have un
swerving faith in Nevada as the coming great
mineral State of America in the immediate
futvre. t

VINCENT FAILS
TO FACE COURT
William Vincent did not appear yes
terday in Judge Graham's court for
further cross-examination by Attorney
Ferman in the suit of his wife. Jane
Vincent, for separate maintenance.
Ferman had promised some sensational
testimony in relation to another wom
an In the case and insisted on tell
ing the court some of the things he
expected to prove before the Judge
continued the hearing until next Tues
day. 1
Among other things, Ferman said
that thirty-two years agoâon August
6, 1872, in factâVincent had applied for
a license to marry his present wife un
der the name of J. H. Johnson, and
had only given his right name when
the ceremony was performed by a
priest. The priest's certificate was kept
by Mrs. Vincent, and it was said that
Vincent often tried to get it from her
with the statement that if he had it
she could never prove that he was her
husband. When her present suit was
filed, said Ferman, the mother of the
Oakland girl whom Vincent is said to
have promised to marry asked him if
he was the defendant in the action. He
declared he was not, and invited a
search of the San Francisco records to
find if he was a married marl. The
girl's brothers began an Investigation
and learned Mrs. Vincent's maiden
name, through which they discovered
the facts relating to the license and
marriage.
Judge Hebbard yesterday ordered
James M. Dunphy, clubman and stock
grower, to pay his wife, Edith M. Dun
phy, $100 a month and $250 attorney's
fees pending the trial of her suit for
separate maintenance. In her suit for
support Mrs. Dunphy recited the
charges of cruelty which were con
tained in her two previous divorce
complaints and added to them the acts
said to have been commuted by her
husband after their last reconciliation.
Judge Graham yesterday heard
enoiurh evidence to convince him that
Mrs. Carrie Keyser, who got an inter
locutory divorce from her husband,
Elias keyser, last July, was not the
proper person to have the custody of
her two minor daughters. He will see
the children in his chambers next Fri
day and then make an order for their
future custody. They are now with
friends of the father at 376 Capp* street,
having been removed there from the
Notre Dame convent in Oakland, where
the mother had placed them. Mrs. Wil
liam Relnsteln, with whom Mrs. Keyser
boarded, testified to the mother's fond
ness for drink and men's company, and
that also upon criticizing Mrs. Key
ser's behavior the latter had slapped
her face. Here the Judge terminated
the hearing.
Divorces were granted yesterday as
follows: By Tudge Graham to Rose
Doran frem Joseph Doran, for habit
ual intettperance; by Judge Kerrigan
t,i Rosalie. *M. Willerlmg from Charles
H. Wilierllng. desertion. Suits for di

POLICE WANT
ORDER REVOKED
The efforts of Chief of Police Witt
man, backed b> the District Attorney
and the Grand Jury, to dissolve the
injunctions which now prevent the
customary police activity at 620 Jack
son street and at Belden place have
brewed a lively legal conflict, which
promises some interesting develop
ments when the controversy Is renew
ed next Monday morning in Judge
Kebbard's court. A start was made
yesterday, and when the question of
a continuance arose Judge Hebbard
announced that he would not permit
the engagements in, other courts of
the busy attorneys to interfere with
following this matter to a finish.
Max J. Kuhl spoke for the Police De
partment, and was flanked by District
Attorney Byington and Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Harris, with Foreman
Andrews of the Grand Jury on hand as
adviser. Kuhl announced his intention
to examine the plaintiffs in the three
cases pending for the purpose of going*
into the' good faith of their injunction
suits, and upon his demand Judge Heb
bard ordered subpenaes issued for Ed
ward Moran, who says the police have
driven him out of his lodgings at 520
Jackson street; Sebastian Ravini, who
declares that his cigar business at the
same number has been ruined by the
police raids, and Mrs. Malienoire, who
sought an order restraining the strong
arm of the law from disturbing her
"lodging-house"' business on Belden
place.
Henry Ach, who plays the role oppo
site to the governmental law depart
ment, offered objections to the pro
posed oral evidence and thought the
case should be tried on affidavits; but
his point was not held good. He then
made a counter move by making a mo
tion for an enlargement of the existing
injunction on behalf of Ravini, and
supported it with an affidavit reciting
the acts of policemen armed with axes
end sledge-hammers, which so terrified
his customers that the tobacco business
is no longer profitable at that stand.
And Ravini, it appeared, has 1800 de
posited as surety for his rent, which
he is afraid he will lose.
Kuhl read the affidavit of Thomas LÂ».
Larkin, a policeman, and had three
more like it, which the court considered
read. Liarkin with great particularity
of detail discussed the inmates of 620
Jackson, their character, habits and
unconventional attire, all of which
tended to prove the contention that the
premises are proper subject for police
supervision
If Aeh's motion for an enlargement
of the order prevails it will prevent the
blockading of Ravini's cigar store, the

OLD SAM OF OAKLAND
ORDERED TO BE SHOT
Fire Department Will End Troubles
of Veteran Horse That Was
the City's pride.
OAKLAND, Jan. 27.âSam, a vet
eran member of the Oakland Fire De
partment and one of the team of
horses that several years ago won a
prize in ' San Francisco as the finest
fire horse team on the Pacific Coast,
has been condemned to death. Old
age is slowly depriving the noble ani
mal of his faculties. Impairment of
tet-th and other infirmities have pre
vented him from eating and old Sam
has been starving to death.
To put the fine fellow out of his
misery and to insure against an ignoble
end of the faithful animal, possibly in
a junk peddler's cart, Chief Engineer
Ball of the Fire Department to-day
obtained permission from the Board of
Police and Fire Commissioners to have
Sam shot
Sam is twenty years old. Fifteen of
his years have been spent in respond
ing ta the call of duty. He was a
remarkably intelligent horse in his
prime and took an almost human in
terest in his exciting life). Chief Ball
and his men are greatly attached to
Sam, who has been a pet of the de->
partment ever since he and his mate
won the laurels named. In his last
days the horse has been cared for with
every comfort. But the gradual break
ing down compelled the Chief to act.
If Sam were simply condemned and
ordered sold his few remaining days
might have been Ignominious and that
no firemen would willingly consent to.
So a bullet to-morrow will end all his
troubles.

OAKLAND. Jan. 27.âEvery other woman
you meet nowadays la up to her ares In soma
charitable undertaking-. In fact tha straight
away social function la really Infrequent In
Oakland, that la, on a large acele. for the
leaders la society are all actively Interested
in somÂ« humane work that take* up ail their
time to the exclusion of affair* that stand for
pleasure pur* and simple. Charity U always
spelled with a capital C m Oakland, and
wherever the greatest of all the virtue* beckons
there fashion followsâsurely a happier state
of affair* than if the amart set frivoled away
preciou* moments in atmles* and selfish en
joyment.
The next big event to call the public to
gether for charity* sake will be on Saturday
evening, February 4, when Henry Payot of
San Franciaco will lecture on "Venice"' for
the benefit of the West Oakland Free Kinder
garten.
Although It la a v*ry Important factor in
the educational life of Oakland really very
Uttle Is known of the splendid work this little
school has done and la still doing. That In
defatigable and enthusiastic philanthropist,
Mrs. Robert Watt. Is president of the kinder
garten association, and associated with her
are many of the most prominent women ot
thie city.
The kindergarten is one of several that are
maintained by private benevolence In various
parts of Oakland. Like the public schools
these kindergartens ace open to ail races and
religions and side by side with some little
foreign schoolmate the white child learns his
first lesson of equal fellowship. It la these
free schools that assimilate our Juventte for
eign population add stimulate an ambition to
become good Americans. Too much cannot
be said in praise of the work done in these
schools, for it Is of Intimate concern to the
city and It discontinued would certainly be
disastrous.
Mr. Payot. who is well known throughout
the State as an entertaining talker, Will Illus
trate 'his lecture with fine stereoptlcon views.
It is to be hoped that Reed Hall will be as
crowded as when Mr. Rlls spoke there re
cently, also tn behalf of the child.
The directors .who assist Mrs. Watt, la the
management of the kindergarten are: Mrs.
Brace Hayden, Mre. J. W. Shanklln, Mrs.
W. G. Palmanteer, Mrs. Henry Wadsworth.

A death is a sad thing to chronicle at any
time, but particularly when the grim reaper
has cut down a promising young life In the

as Pearl Kendall. It seem* only yesterday
that I saw her a lovely, happy bride, but since

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, JANUARY 28, 1905.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 27.
The case of Paul O'Leary, who was
found in a comatose state last night in
front of his home at 569 Twenty-eighth
street, soon after his father had re
ceived a mysterious message over the
telephone that the young man had com
mitted suicide, rests unsolved by the
police.
Though the boy, when he regained i
consciousness, told his folks he had
been assaulted by a tall dark man,
there was not a sign of violence visible
to the practiced eyes of Dr. E. N. Ewer, i
the physician who was called to the
house as soon as the senseless youth .
had been taken there. Not a particle i
of evidence could be found to indicate j
such an 'attack.
There are some evidences that the
deep coma was a trance.
When O'Leary was found lying as if |
dead near the house, Special Policeman j
Einigh could not discover a sign of life, j
The young man was in what might !
have been a cataleptic . state. There
was not enough respiration or pulse
to be distinguished by the patrolman.
His report that the man was dead was
made to the Coroner, who sent the
Morgue wagon to the place. Only by
accident was O'Leary's real condition
disclosed. Detective George Kyte |
flashed an electric hand lamp in the I
face of the prostrate youth, and no- |
ticed a slight tremor of his eyelids. The
officer had aroused the family and
medical attention was quickly given.
Some papers aad a pocket knife that
belonged to O'Leary were found near
him, but if he was attacked by a foot
pad, the assailant took nothing from
him, for his money was undisturbed in ,
his pockets. The boy said he had drawn
the knife for self-defense after he had
been struck on the head. The police
do not credit this statement because a
blow severe enough to knock the vic
tim down would have dazed him so
that he-could-not have moved to save !
himself.
Dr. Ewer after a careful examination
gave.the opinion to the police that the
patient had been suffering from a se
vere attack of nervous hysteria. It is
not certain that the boy telephoned the
message of death himself, but the in
dications.are strongly that way in view
of his actions several months ago when
he was sent under restraint to the re
ceiving hospital because his people
feared he might do harm to himself.
So far as the police are concerned the
investigation was dropped to-day, as
there seemed to be nothing tangible
upon which to work from the point of
V.i*y..'of a criminal casf,. Q'Leary was
mufen improved to-day.
ENDS HIS LIFE
WITH A NOOSE
ALAMEDA, Jan. 27.âWorry because
of ill health and lack of employment
and brooding over the order from his
own brother-in-law to vacate the cot
tage in which he and his family were
sheltered, John Hearn, a cabinet-maker,
went into the attic of his home this
morning and hanged himself to a rafter
with a piece of clothesline. His body
was discovered dangling from the
beam. His 15-year-old son, Stanley
Hearn, found it. Dr. L. W. Stidnam
was summoned by John Hearn Jr., an
other son of the deceased, and they cut
the remains down. Life was found ex
tinct, and it Is the opinion of the phy
sician that Hearn had been dead for
several hours.
Hearn's wife says that on last
Wednesday John Martin, her brother
in-law, told her husband that he would
have to find another house, as Martin,
who owns the cottage where the
Hearns reside, said he wanted the resi
dence for other tenants. This notice,
together with sickness and failure to
obtain work. Mrs. Hearn affirms,
preyed on her husband's mind until it
drove him to take his life with the
noose.
Hearn was a native of England, 49
years of age, and came here three years
ago. He was a member of the Alameda
Carpenters' Union and was regarded as
an expert workman. Surviving him are
a wife and three childrenâJohn Hearn
Jr., Edythe Hearn and Stanley Hearn.
Deputy Coroner Hugh C. Gallagher has
taken charge of the body, and an in
quest will be held to-morrow morning
at 9:30 o'clock.

CLEVER PUPIL
HAS A CHANCE
TO WIN MEDAL
V
BERKELEY. Jan. 27.âA gold medal to the
student in the agricultural college who makes
the greatest advance in the study of practical
agriculture, to be shown by a written essay,
has been offered by an Eastern agricultural
publication. Profesaor E. W. Hllgard has re
ceived notice of the publication company's In
tention to award the medal. It is stipulated
that the subject in which the "greatest ad
vance" is made must be of practical value to
the ordinary farmer, dealing either with agri
culture, horticulture, stock raising, dairy, farra
lns or breeding of animals. The periodical
reierve* the right to print the facts on the
awarding of the medal, together with the
es&ays that competing students may write.
Th u gold medal will be presented by the
faculty of the college at the end of the present
college year.
Colonel Henry de H. Walte, formerly com
mandant of the University Cadets, has been
admitted to practice in the courts of the

Legislature to investigate the university's af
fairs will arrive in Berkeley next Friday.
There will be about twenty members of the
Legislature In the party. They will be en
tertained by President Wheel#r and will at
tend the semi-monthly university meeting in
Htrmon gymnasium.
Â«<rhe military authorities at the university are
in conflict with the athletic contingent over
the question of keeping the baseball fence down
during drill hours. Captain J. T. Nance ha*
requested President Wheeler to order the fence
removed, to permit of such evolutions by the
university cadets as Captain Nance wishes per
formed. The fence Is needed by the baseball
people to insure gate receipts during games,
and If removed each week, when drill work is
done, the expense during the term will be
about $900. The matter has been discussed
at length by Captain Nance and Manager
Ezra Decoto. but no action has been taken.

vices of J. White of San Francisco as a
boxing instructor. White has a similar position

JOINT STATEHOOD BILL.
Senator Gatlinger Speaks in Support
of His Amendment.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.âConsider
ation of the joint statehood bill was
resumed to-day, Gallinger addressing
the Senate in support of his amend
ment prohibiting traffic in intoxicat
ing liquors in Indian Territory, saying
the Indians themselves, desired to be
so protected.
Spooner expressed the opinion that
in admitting a State Congress had no
right to grant privileges to one class
and not another, nor could the Fed
eral Government retain control of one
class of offenses and cede it in others.
If, for instance, Congress could re
tain control of the s&\e of liquor it
could retain it in case of burglary.
"Or of polygamy," suggested Piatt
cf Connecticut.
"Yes," responded Spooner, and he
added, "Utah ought not to have been
admitted into the Union, but, once ad
mitted on an equality with other States
Congress had no more power to deal
with polygamy than it had to deal with
burglary there."
Stewart supported the amendment,
saying that the guardianship of the
United States over the Indians did not
cease to exist so long as the Govern
ment exercised control over the prop
erty of the Indians, even though they
be citizens.
The Senate went into executive ses
sion and adjourned.
AGRICULTURAL BILL PASSED.
Free Seed Distribution Called Petty
Larceny in House.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.âThe House
to-day passed the agricultural appro
priation bill without material amend
ment. The usual discussion of free
seed distribution was Indulged in, Lil
>ey of Connecticut censuring it as petty
larceny. The relative value of the cot
ton statistics as supplied by the Cen
sus Bureau and Agricultural Depart
ment also furnished the *theme for a
lively debate.
Williams of Mississippi revived the
discussion as to retired officers of the
army serving with the millia, when
Hull of lowa asked unanimous consent
that the Senate amendments to the
army appropriation bill be sent to con
ference. The Senate substitute for the
House provision was acceptable to
Williams, for he moved to concur in
that particular amendment. He asked
Hull to make the motion to concur, but
Hull declined, saying he was much op
posed to the amendment because if the
legislation was proper it was Just as
proper to make it retroactive.

CABINET OFFICERS MEET.
Discuss Teaching of Jin Jitsu and
Wireless Telegraphy.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.âAmerica is
learning lessons from the Russo-Japa
nese war which will prove valuable to
both the army and navy of the United
States. Some of these lessons were
considered at the meeting of the Cabi
net to-day and the discussion which en
eued will result in definite action
in a few days. Some time ago the sug
gestion was made that instructors be
employed at the academies to teach the
science of jiu jitsu, the Japanese method
of wrestling. At the meeting to-day
the entire subject was discussed very
fully and it was concluded to appoint a
joint military and naval board to study
the matter with the idea of supplying
the cadets at the two national acade
mies with instruction not only in wrest
ling, but in sword exercises and other
forms of exercise which might prove of
value to the cadets in personal en
counters. It was pointed out that the
pending Eastern war had demonstrated
that hand-to-hand encounters were
much more likely to occur In the course
of war than had been supposed. In
many of these fights the Japanese,
through their superior knowledge of
sword play and their remarkable agili
ty, had overcome their opponents.
It was announced after the meeting
that an order forming the proposed
board, would be issued soon.
The Cabinet also discussed the sub
ject of Government supervision of wire
less telegraph. The matter was
brought up at a Cabinet meeting about
a year ago, and a special commission
appointed for the purpose of investi
gating it fully made a report to the.
President. As the matter now stands
it will require Congressional action to
carry into effect the ideas of the admin
istration. It is likely that Secretaries
Morton and Taft will bring the subject
to the attention of Congress in a formal
way, recommending the legislation they
deem desirable.
The administration's views have been
embodied in a bill by the Com
missioner of Navigation, assisted by
Captain Seabury of the navy and oth
ers. The bill Is to be revised further
by the Cabinet. It provides that no
person or corporation shall use any
apparatus for wireless telegraphy it)
this country or upon any American
vessel except he be licensed by the
Secretary of Commerce and Labor.
Persons exchanging messages or sig
nals between points situated in the
same State or on behalf of the Ameri
can Government are to be exempt from
this requirement, however. The official
license shall provide that the Presi
dent of the United States in time of
war or public peril may close any wire
less station or authorise Its use by the
Government.
The President is given power to es
tablish regulations which shall prevent
interference between the naval and
military wireless telegraph stations
and the private or commercial stations.
Each licensed station is to be required
to answer calls and signals from any
other licensed station and to receive
all such messages or signals offered
for transmission to a neighboring sta
tion, the rate to be that customarily
required for such service; This re
quirement is to be observed regardless
of the system used on pain of revoca

SMOOT'S SIDE
IS PRESENTED
Attorney Van Cott Argues
I for the Utah Senator Be
fore Inquiry Committee
WASHINGTON. Jan. 27.âArgument*
for the defense were made to-day in
the Smoot investigation before the Sen
ate Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions. They were preceded by a repl/
of Judge Tayler, attorney for the pro-i
testants, who answered, questions pro
pounded by Senator Knox.
Judge Tayler e-aid the chief charge
against Senator Smoot waa that he was
the integral part of the quorum of
twelve, which he declared to be all
there was to the Mormon church. Tha
president of the church, said Judge
Tayler, waa the creature of the quorum
of apostles and could be removed
by it
Judge Tayler quoted from the testi
mony of Senator Smoot and other wit
nesses concerning their beliefs in revel
ations and said that all the persons
who were committed to such beliefs
were disqualified to sit as Senators. Ua
stated that If no attention had been at
tracted to the church by violations of
the law it was not likely that religious
belief would have been brought into
the discussion, but that polygamy waa
the result of revelations. This imme
diate contact with God, through per
sonal revelations, he declared to be suf
ficient to disqualify any person for the
position of Senator, no matter what his
creed.
As reasons why Smoot should retain
his seat, Van Cott gave the following:
That Smoot could not have secured the
Legislature without the aid of the gen
tile voters; that he opposed the Evans
bill, which was vetoed by the Gover
nor; that he encouraged the State Su
perintendent in driving religious classea
out of the public schools and that ne
was not a polygamist. He then made
the declaration that if Smoot should
be unseated it would solidify the Mor
mons more than ever.
Van Cott opened his argument by
declaring the contention of the protest
ants to be untenable in that they admit
they could charge Senator Smoot with
no offense recognizable by law and that
the only thing brought against him
was that he believed in revelations.
Emphasis was laid by Van Cott on the
fact that Senator Smoot had never re
ceived a revelation and that there was
no indication that he ever would. Ho
declared that Senator Smoot was being
prosecuted on the ground that his re
ligion at some time might cause him to
commit an overt act.
He deprecated what he termed to be
an attempt to return to the*dark ages
of religious persecutions. Van Cott
then summed up the testimony of wit
nesses who were examined in relation
to the politics of Utah and Idaho,
which he declared failed to show one
instance of Interference in politics.
TWO NEW SHIPS
FOR THE NAVY
WASHINGTON. Jan. 27.âThe House
Committee on Naval Affairs to-day de
cided upon a naval Increase programme
to be incorporated in the navy appro
priation bill, providing for but two bat
tleships. They are to be of 16,000 tons
each, representing the largest type and
carrying the heaviest armament and
armor. The vote by which the two
ships were authorized was IS to 4. ThÂ«
navy bill was completed to-day and will
be reported to the House by Chairman
Foss. It carries appropriations approx-
imatlng (100,070,000.
There were different views In the
committee as to the number of ships
that should be authorized, some favor
ing three, others but one, and one mem
ber opposed constructing any vessels.
The first motion was for three battle
ships. An amendment was proposed
limiting the number to one, which was
defeated by a vote of 10 to 7. It was
then amended so as to provide for twoÂ»
and was adopted. The majority against
providing torpedo and submarine craft
was but one.
The bill provides for 3000 additional
seamen and gives the marine corps 200
additional non-commissioned officers
and 1000 additional privates.

OFFICERS HAVE BEEN SECURED AND THE VESSEL WILL GET AWAY NEXT WEEK
The Pacific Mail Company's liner San
Juan, Captain Vrry, arrived early yes
terday from Panama and way ports.
She Drought thirty-one passengers, 1362
tons of cargo and treasure valued at
' $43,233. Among the passengers was En-
Carnacion Mejia, Consul from Salvador
to this port. Mejia has been visiting
his home.
â¢ From Corinto to Acapulco the San
Juan carried as a passenger JBishop
Pereira F. Gonzales of Nicaragua.' The
Bishop, it seems, had been taking a
more actiye interest in Niaraguan poli
tits than the gove#nment of that re
public thought proper for a gentleman
of his cloth, and he boarded the San
Juan escorted by a file of soldiers, who
maintained a vigil at the gangplank to
insure his not walking ashore again.
The right reverend passenger attempt
<l to land at several ports north of Co
rinto. but not until Acapulco was
iea< hed would the authorities ashore
permit him to leave the liner. The Gov
ernment in Mexico is too stable to be in
any danger from a priestly agitator,
and at Acapulco Bishop Gonzales found
a refuge. The Bishop is a young man
and appeared to be more than suffi
ciently supplied with cash. He wore a
wealth of gold chains and charms, and
his fingers glittered with diamonds.
The San Juan docked at Lombard
street wharf, where she will discharge
her cargo. Her passengers included the
following: John L. Cooper, Maurice
W'eiller, Encarnacion Mejia. J. Hines,
W. H. Cooper, G. Dean, Marie Arguett'a.
.C. Henry. C. W. Benton, H. J. Aranjo
and Mrs. A. M. Garland.
Ships New Officers.
The British steamer Tottenham, or Brink
burne, as she is to be known hereafter, was
towed down from Port Costa yesterday and
. ked at Beale street, where she will finish
loading a large cargo for Vladivostok. In view
of the fact that the Brinkburne is going on a
. blockade running expedition and that the Jap
anese have given clear demonstration of their
â¢'watchfulness, the chances of the Brinkburne's
â  delivering her cargo at the Russian port are
. tslim. Taking this view, all of the steamer's
officers, except Captain Peters, have resigned
and if they were not bound by a three-year
contract and In a port where an exclusion act
â Ik an obstacle to landing the Brinkburne's
Chinese crew would follow the officers' ex
amples. The Brinkburne's new officers will
Join the ship on Monday. The officers who are
' leaving say that the consequences to them
would be very serious in the event of capture
by the Japanese. In addition to the probability
of imprisonment they fear that the British
Board of Trade might take away their licenses
and deprive them of the right of ev?r again
serving as officers under the British flag.
Among the men who will take the places oti
the officers with "cold feet" Is Captain Wll
â¢ liam Hill, who will be thÂ» Brinkburne's new
chief officer. Hill was navigator of the Jap
. anese cruiser Nisshin and helped Captain Lea
to take that vessel from Genoa and deliver her
to the Mikado. For his share in that venture
he received the personal thanks of the Japanese
â Emperor. He Is now seeking a* smile of ap
proval from the Czar.
Manchuria Will Sail To-Day.
The Pacific Mall Company's big lin?r Man
churia, Captain Saunders, will sail at 1 o'clock
to-day for the Orient with nearly 16,000 tons
of cargo and more than 700 passengers. The
liner arrived January 19 with more than 12,000
tons of freight. "Get her discharged, loaded
and ready to sail by January 28 If possible
â¢ and. possible or not, get her ready anyhow,"
were the orders given to Captain Wilson, the
company's stevedore in chief. It has meant
work day and night for Wilson and an army
of men, but when the clock strikes one to-day
the Manchuria's lines will be cast off and
she will start on her long voyage. Most of
her cargo is for Japan and it Includes a large
. amount of machinery. Among the passengers
' will be Chinese and Japanese commissioners
to St. Louis, who are. returning to the Far
East, and a nsimber of navy officers. Sixteen
â  Japanese and one Korean, suffering from tra
choma, will be deported on the Manchuria.
Purser Niswander Resigns.
â¢ â¢M. S. Nlswander, purser of the steamship
â¢Doric, has resigned from the service of the
. Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company
â  to go Into business for himself in th-s Orient.
: Nlswander has been with the company for
â¢ more than fourteen years. He was the senior
. iMirser in the service and stands high In the
' regard of company officials and of his ship
â¢ mates. Quietly and unobtrusively Nlswander

Lies in Pauper's Grave.
The steamer San Juan, which arrived yes
terday from Panama, brought details of the
death at the Isthmus of J. W. O'Connor, once
captain In the Pacific Mail Company's service,
o Connor had the reputation of being one of
the beat navigators In the service. He was a
thorough aailorman and a good officer. There
was no position In the company's gift that
would have been out of his reach. Drink

penniless and alone and was burled in a
pauper's grave. The officers of the mail com
pany, it is understood, will take steps to
provide a burial place for their former ship
mate which will be a fitting tribute to the
memory*of the man he once was.
MahUkona in No Danger.
Hind, Rolph & Co., received a telegram yes
terday from their agent at Portland stating
that the schooner Mahukona. reported almost
ashore In the. breakers inside the, Columbia
River bar, was never at any time in the least
danger. The big schooner sailed across the
bar. She got inside as the tide turned and
was obliged to anchor. The tug Tatoosh, when
she reached the schooner, found her In no
danger and made no effort to pass a line to
her until the tide turned and the tug was
ready to tow the Mahukona in.

PEYTON TELLS
ABOUT THREATS
Throughout the pleadings of the Pey
ton Chemical Company in its litigation
with the E. I. Dv Pont de Nemours
Powder Company of New Jersey,
known as the powder trust, it has been
alleged that the more powerful corpora
tion was trying to wreck the local con
cern, yesterday in Judge Seawell's
court, W. C. Peyton, president of the j
chemical company testified directly as
to threats made by officers of the trust. |
Peyton was on the stand in the hear- I
ing of the application of the trust for I
a writ of mandate permitting it to in- j
spect the Peyton Company's books. He j
was asked by Attorney Cerf to specify
sume of the Threats made. â¢â¢Well," he j
said, "Vice President Moxham of the
Dv Pont Company said to me that he
would use every means to accomplish
the ruin of our corporation, unless I
would turn over sumcient of my per
sonal stock to give them the control."
Mr. Peyton said that threats had been
made by other Dv Pont directors, and
one of the means intended to be used
to ruin the Peyton Company was to
sue for a receivership and destroy its
credit. Another was to break con
tracts, and this had been done, he said,
by the California Powder Company,
one of the corporations controlled by
the trust. Peyton was not permitted
to testify as to the damages incurred
by this breach of contract, but it is
known that a suit thereon for $572,000
is pending.
Garret W. McEnerney, one of the at
torneys for the Dv Ponts cross-exam
ined the chemical company president
as to his reasons for declining to per
mit R. S. Penniman, vice president of
the California Powder Company, to in
spect the Peyton records after he had
presented a power of attorney from the
Dv Ponts. Peyton frankly said that he
had been advised that the power of at
torney wag defective; that he believed j
Penniman was inimical to the business. I
and that the purpose of the Dv Ponts
in giving him the power of attorney
was inimicalâthat an inspection of
the books was sought with evil intent.
Mr. McEnerney also examined him at
length upon the advice he had received
from his counsel, and as to his under
standing of how long the inspection of
the books could be delayed by an ap
peal of the present case to the Supreme
Court. Peyton thought it would only
be a few months.
The Peyton Company's minute book
Is now in New York in the hands of
Attorney Bartnett, but it has been tele
graphed for and will be here next
Thursday when the hearing will be re
sumed. A part of the Peyton's de
fense will be upon the contention that
the Dv Pont Company cannot maintain
an action in the California courts as it
has not compiled with the law regard
ing the filing of articles of incorpora
tion.

MONEY NEEDED
FOR OFFICERS
. At an annual meeting of the Asso
ciated Charities in the rooms of the
Merchants' Association yesterday,
Herbert W. Lewis and President Os
good Putnam threw some light on the
perplexities that attend the payment
of the probationary officers connect
ed with the Juvenile Courts. Several
bills have been introduced at the in
stance of the Associated Charities for
the consideration of the California
Legislature. One of the bills provides
for municipal salaries for the proba
tionary officers. As Messrs. Lewis
and Putnam explained the situation,
fear is entertined that officers who are
paid by the public might be improp
erly selected by reason of purely po
litical influence. On the other hand,
there is great difficulty in raising suf
ficient money by private subscription
to continue their work.
An Interesting report of the first
year's work of the Children's Agency
for San Francisco and vicinity was
submitted by Mrs. Isabel H. Ray
mond. Reports were also received
from Robert Porter, chairman of the
Legislative committee and from Gen
eral Secretary John Chetwood con
cerning progress in the movement to
have the hospitals of the city and San
Francisco placed under the control of
a non-partisan board of trustees.

ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO

PTJBIJCATION OFFICE THIRD~AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
SATURDAY JANUARY ".J^
THE NEW MERCHANTS' EXCHANGE.
THE combination of the various commercial bodies of this city
into a Merchants' Exchange that is able to command the credit
and the resources required for the erection of the splendid
building that was formally devoted to its purposes by proper cere
mony on Saturday is an event that deserves more than passing
notice. Commerce began here, as it has begun elsewhere, in the
individual efforts of enterprising men, who saw an opportunity for
gain in the exchanges of the commercial world. It was long before
there was any substantial spirit of co-operation. This first appeared
with the regular steamer service started between San Francisco and
the isthmus by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.
It is of interest that the completion of the new exchange build
ing, a high expression of that co-operation, comes almost at the
same time as the disappearance of that steamship service after
â¢ fifty years of existence. The abrogation of the contract with the
Panama railroad will doubtless conclude it, as it ceases then to
have a protection equivalent to that of our domestic coasting trade,
and the service it has performed will pass under the same condi
tions as our other deep-water trade and will be done mostly under
foreign flags. In the early days it was more important to own a
boat on the bay and rivers than to own a deep-water ship. Our
heroic history has a great chapter recording the river trade by j
which we reached the rich mining regions, then the source of the
' State's wealth.
Then follows the romance of development. The trade of
" Hawaii was concentrated here by the old reciprocity treaty. The
islands were made profitable by the bold venture of this city in sugar
refining. Hawaii became a new field for profitable investment of !
. .American capital. San Francisco set up a king in Hawaii and gave
him a kingdom, dealt with him as an agent of development and sta
bility, sheltered here his deathbed, and when he died held his obse
quies and paid due respect to his memory.
â  The Hawaiian trade was the forerunner of the longer outreach
for the commerce of Eastern Asia. We rapidly acquired the knowl
' edge, upon which to found that trade. We have domesticated here
the great Chinese merchants whose energy is necessary to it. We
have our Asiatic banks and commercial organizations, our lines of
ships, our trade established, and are ready for any degree of devel
opment that may be possible. Nor are we unmindful of our oppor
tunity among our own race in the and among the island
: ers in the Pacific. Our ocean lines run to Tahiti and Samoa and to
Australia and New Zealand.
â  All communication is open now between us and the great ocean,
its islands and its farther shore. A San Francisco merchant has
â¢ the international outlook, with Asia, Africa and the islands of the
sea all open to his enterprise and ready to yield his profit. Our
. hinterland, even if restricted to California, is the richest in the world,
the most productive, the most varied and valuable in its resources.
All of this vast and inspiring view is the foundation upon which
the new Merchants' Exchange is built. It has come in the right time.
â¢ It is a monument to past enterprise and a guarantee of that to come.
It is the final expression of assured co-operation between our mer
chants in all those essentials which require common effort, and is the
noble outgrowth of a great past, the assurance of a greater future.
In no city in the Union is there a nobler or better building dedi
cated to a similar purpose. The time has come when every San
Francisco merchant must do business "on change," like those in
the great sea ports of Europe. Our Government is fighting our bat
tle for the open door in China. Let us hold up its hands. It will
win. When Dewey fought in Manila bay we thought he had prob
ably saved San Francisco from hostile invasion. But he did more
than. that. His guns affirmed American primacy on the Pacific
â¢Ocean.. As we are in the position of the greatest advantage for the
commercial control of that ocean, the smoke of his guns wrote the
. name of San Francisco above the fleet that he destroyed. The open
door oh the other side is for us to enter. Beyond it lies our trade.
This city is to-day being built on the plains of Manchuria and in
: the valley of the / Yangtse. We go there not with war, but with
â¢ peace.
Politicians make war. Merchants make peace. Much has been
said about the disadvantages we have suffered by the presence of
. Chinese here, and but little about the advantages we have enjoyed.
We have learned China. We know her people, her trade and her
: capacities. Commerce is democratic and cosmopolitan. We have
contact with the Chinese merchants, who, in some important respects,
are the best merchants in the world, not even excepting the Parsees
of Bombay. They are our allies in making conquest of the trade of
Asia and they will serve us well.
The new exchange will give shelter and facilities for the most
â¢interesting trade in the world. It will be the romance of commerce
carried on with Japan, China and Korea, old lands, long sleeping,
hut now in the vigor of an awakening. The Merchants' Exchange
should list in its membership every merchant in this city, and all
.should be proud of a connection with an organization that has
'wrought so well.
THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
THE steady downfall of the old Mexican and Spanish landhold
ers as their lands were gradually encroached upon by the
aggressive American settlers has furnished material for the
pens of fiction writers many times before this, and will probably

tory is ably and artistically handled in the prize story in the Sunday
Call's fiction contest, which appears to-morrow. The story, which

tures of interest to-morrow will be a bright and pithy article by
Kate Thyson Marr, on "The Woman Who Is Too Amiable." After
going on to prove that there is such a woman, she says: "The
woman who is too amiable is one-third angel and two-thirds fool

claimable, too volatile to be changed, and, in fact, too thoroughly
negative not to be entirely obliterated by her own light."

THE MAGIC KETTLE; OR. A LIQUID-AIR TRAGEDY.
TICKETED TO MATRIMONY
, ETTER be good and make
up," urged Jimmy Garrisop.
â  "Be good!" stormed Grace
Burton. "Do you suppose I
want to be good if that con
templates listening to your conversa
tion?"
"I'm sorry I joked about the little
poem," he pleaded contritely. "Make
up and I'll never say anything like
that again."
"You will not have the opportunity,
Jimmy Garrison," she scolded. "Take
back your ring, and I'm never going
to speak to you again."
"I say," he cried, "don't take it like
that. You'll have to speak to me
again."
"Never," she retorted firmly. "If I
do. I'llâ"
"Take back the ring," urged Jim
my before she could finish.
"Yes," she assented defiantly. "If
I ever spÂ«ak to you again I'll take
back the ring; but I don't intend to
speak to you."
Jimmy looked at her ruefully as she
turned away. He knew that she
prided herself upon her firmness and
that for a time she would hold to her
threat. ThenâJimmy smiled in an
ticipation of the delights of "making
up."
But the next day there seemed
small chance of an early reconcilia
tion, for it was announced that Grace
was to spend the winter with an aunt
in Los Angeles, and was to start in a
few days. It was rather short notice,
but Mr. Burton had been suddenly
called to Europe and he could not
take both Mrs. Burton and Grace.
Secretly Grace was sorry that she
had permitted herself to become so
angry over Jimmy's Jokes about her
little poem, which he local paper had
printed, but she was stubborn and
after a final appeal Jimmy yielded to
fate and announced that he would |
leave that night for Chicago.
Apparently he went further afield
than that, for a few mornings later
the overland rolled into Omaha and
there was Jimmy on the station plat
form waiting to take passage. Orace
gasped as the porter ushered him into
a section a few numbers ahead of her
own, but to outward appearances she
was absolutely ignorant of his pres
ence.
She fidgeted about uneasily through
the twenty-minute wait in the station
while he regarded her with the un
concern of a stranger, and she was
glad when the train got under way
again and he had gone forward to the
smoker.
He was back presently, though, and
was in his section when the new con- j
ductor came through. Jimmy prompt- ]
ly handed up his ticket, but there was
some delay when Grace surrendered
the check for her transportation, giv
en to the conductor over night.
"You had.a pass, didn't you?" asked
the conductor as he glanced at the
number on her check and selected an
envelope from the package he carried.
"Can you identify yourself?"
She glanced through her pocket
book, but there was nothing which
could serve to identify her and
through some mischance she had not
signed the ticket, as she should have
done when it had been given to her.
"Unless you can show some Identifi
cation I shall have to collect a cash
fare?" the conductor said sharply, no- >
ticing her helplessness.
"I can't," she stammered. "I have not
that much money with me."
"Any one on board who can Identify
you?" Clearly he was growing sus
picious. Grace was desperate.
"That gentleman up front knows me,"
she said slowly. Indicating Jimmy. The
conductor went forward and she
matched him curiously, it waa odd that
GEORGE HEMMINGWAY.
Jimmy, who had evidently taken this
train to tease her, was to be of some
real service to her instead.
But somehow the conductor's face did
not express satisfaction as he came
back down the aisle.
"I suppose you are convinced now?"
"Do you mean to tell this
conductor you don't know me?"
said Grace, with a confidence she did
not feel, as he stopped at her seat.
"He says he knows the real Miss Bur
ton," said the conductor, eyeing her
sharply.
There was an odd little gasp of an
ger as Miss Burton sprang to her feet
and unsteadily made her way down the
aisle, the conductor following. "Jimmy
Garrison," she demanded, "do you
mean to tell this conductor that you
don't know me?"
"Never said It." said Jimmy calmly.
"He asked me If I could identify Miss
Burton, and I said I knew Miss Bur
ton."
"Well." she said, in a puzasled tone.
'Possibly," explained Jimmy blandly,
"he might havergathered from my tone
that I did not see Miss Burton on the
car."
"You mean," she corrected, "that you
wanted to make me ask you to identify
me."
"Yes," said Jimmy, solemnly offering
a ring. "I thought you might speak to
me."
For the first time it flashed upon her
what "business" had drawn Jimmy
West, and while he was assuring the
conductor that she was Miss Burton
she flew back to her seat and sat there
with naming cheeks. Jimmy followed
her as soon as he had disposed of the
conductor.
"Sweetheart," he said tenderly, "it
was a mean trick to play, but I knew
I simply had to make you speak before
you got out to L.os Angeles, and as my
cousin is superintendent of this division
I got him to order the pass watched
tot."
"But how did X get a pass?" she de
manded.
"I gave It to your father, and he gave
us his blessing," Jimmy explained. "He

INTERESTING SESSION AT ST. LUKE'S CHURCH
Never in the history of woman's work
,ih the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of
â¢California has more enthusiasm been
â¢shown than during the observance of
â Woman'B Auxiliary day at St. Luke's
Cliurch, Van Ness avenue and Clay
street, yesterday.
.Tne number attending holy com
munion, at which the Right Rev. Wil
liam Ford Nichols was celebrant, far
<..x.ceeded' even that of last year, and in
.the- afternoon, when the business of
Ihe â¢ auxiliary was taken up, the spa
cious Sunday-school room was crowded.
At the service in the morning the
â¢ReV. Burr M. Weeden, rector of St.
iLuk'e'a. assisted the Bishop, and an in
teresting sermon was delivered by the
iiev. Charles T. Walkley, rector of St
Haul's Church, Oakland.
Mr. Walkley likened the present con
dition of Oriental nations to Belchaz
zar*s feast, and in part said:
â¢ They have the gold and silver and trophies
of'civilization, but not the spirit of civiliza
â¢t :â¢ This Is strikingly illustrated in the in
.ti eduction of the railroads in Japan which
â¢now run large excursions to various shrines
of their ancient gods; and priests with tilled
'coffers thank Christian civilization for the
railroad.
â¢Another thing is the use of modern medicine ,
and surgery in the Japanese army. No na
tion has so well cared tor its wounded in war
as Japan. Medical representatives of the
â world follow her army to observe.the methods
of her hospital corps at work, but the fact
remains that the Japanese still worship the
Idols of their fathers.
IDEALS FOUND WANTING.
: The ethical ideals of the Orient and their
priesthood have been tried and found wanting.
There is no nation In the world with higher
.Ideals than Brahmanical India, and no na- j
II oft has failed so ignominiousiy to reach them.
The idea that commercialism is Christianity
<s absolutely false. Commercialism carries
with It destructive elements of civilization, as
is witnessed in <he slave trade In Africa, the !
American Indian and the disappearance of
whole tribes in the Pacific, especially Hawaii,
where the vices of civilization have been
taken without the virtues.
Commercialism Is not Christianity.
The handwriting on the wall points to the
dismemberment of China, the disintegration of
Oriental empires, and this at the hand of
commerce. The salvation of the Orient de
pends upon the principle of a Daniel, In whom
is the spirit of the living God.
After service the ladies of St Luke's
served a sumptuous luncheon, at which 1
the following were invited guests: Bish
op and Mrs. Nichols, Bishop Logan
Herbert Roots and Mrs. Roots, who
leave for China to-day; Rev. Burr M.
Weeden and Mrs. Weeden, Rev. Mr. and I
Mrs. Walkley, Rev. David Evans, Rev. 1
W; E. Hayes, Rev. W. M. Bours and
.Rev.. H. B. Collier. Owing to indisposi- !
t-ion the Right Rev. Bishop Restarlck
of Honolulu was unable to be present.
The semi-annual meeting, which fol
lowed, was presided over by Bishop
Nichols. Mrs. James Newlands, presi
dent- of the California branch of the
.Woman's Auiliary to the Board of Mis
sions, and other officers were on the
platform.
BISHOP'S CONGRATULATIONS.
Bishop Nichols delivered an address
of felicitation, in which he took occa
sion to congratulate the assemblage
upon its great rally and the spiritual
warmth and increasing efforts as shown
in its labors. He paid a special tribute
to . the* work of Miss Patterson, who
without stipend has been and is doing
Strong work for the Japanese Mission.
Mra Susan S. Lawyer, secretary, gave
a stirring account of the work of the
delegation to the convention in Boston,
and paid a hearty tribute to Mrs. Wil
liam Ford Nichols and the other ladies
associated with her.
An Impassioned address was deliv
ered by Howard Richards Jr. of New
York City, a young man who starts out
to the mission field in Central China to
day to take up educational work In the
â Boone school. Richards, who played
right halfback in the Yale football team
In 1899. is full of the missionary spirit
as-was evidenced in his address.
Mrs. Roots gave a graphic account of
missionary work, and Bishop Roots,
who with his wife has done much work
in the field, told his hearers of the kind
â¢of effort that is neededâprimarily the
teaching of the natives that they may
in turn go out and teach and spread j
-the word of the gospel among their
oivn.
Dr. Teusler of St Luke's Hospital,
Tokio, who also leaves to-day for the
Orient, spoke interestingly of the mcdi- i
ral results and increased usefulness of
the hospital in the missionary field. Dr. j
H. B. Taylor, another outgoing mis
sionary, who will be associated with j
Dr. Woodward in his new hospital at
Nankin, was among those on the plat
form.
Object to Red Rock.
A petition signed by many Market
street storekeepers was filed yesterday
with the Board of Supervisors calling
attention to the fact that the many
holes in the bituminous pavement of
the. thoroughfare have been filled with

The Plan Upon Which Coffee Operates
Coffee is such a secret worker that it
is not suspected as the cause of sick
ness or disease, but there is a very sure
. way to find out the truth.
â¢ A lady in Memphis gives an interest
ing experience her husband had with
coffee. It seems that he had been
using it for some time and was an in
â¢ valid.
.The physician in charge shrewdly
suspected that coffee was the "Worm
at the root of the tree," and ordered it
discontinued with instructions to use
Postum Food Coffee reg larly In its
place. â¢
The wife says: "We found that was
the true remedy for his stomach and
heart trouble a/irt we would have glad
ly paid a hundred times the amount of
the doctor's charge when we found how
wise his Judgment was.
"The use of Postum instead of coffee
was begun about a year ago, nd it has
made my husband a strong, well man.
He has gained thirty-five pounds in
that time and his stomach and heart
trouble have all disappeared.
"The first time I prepared it I did not
boil It long enough and he said thers
was something wrong with it. Sure
enough it did taste very flat, but the
next morning I followed directions
carefully, boiling it for fifteen minutes,
and he remarked 'this is better than
any of the old coffee.'
"We use Postum regularly and never
tire of telling our friends of the benefit
we have received from leaving off the
old fashioned coffee." Name given by
Postum Co., Battle Creek, Mich.

other block for $140,000.
Wise objected to the city holding
out a portion of the amount set aside
in the bond issue for the purchase of
the lands to pay for the expense of
the printing of the bonds. The com
mittee said that the expense would
amount to $650 and the owners
agreed to share this.
It was stated that the two offers
aggregated the entire sum of the bond
issue for Mission Park, amounting to
$292,000, which was less than the
market value of the properties, these
having been appraised at $303,000 at
the time of the submission of the park
panhandle bond proposition. Both
blocks were formerly used for the
Jewish cemeteries.
The committee voted unanimously
to accept the offers of the religious so
cieties subject to the final approval of
the City Attorney.
Assistant City Attorney John P.
Coghlan explained that it would be
necessary to secure abstracts of title'
of lands proposed to be purchased
for the Golden Gate Park and Presi
dio Extension. Coghlan's suggestion
that bids for the abstracts be invited
was adopted and he was asked to pre
pare the necessary specifications
therefor.
Policeman Murphy Suspended.
Policeman Michael Murphy was sus
pended yesterday by Chief Wlttman
pending the result of the Coroner's in
quest to-day on the body of John
Thompson, who died from a fractured
skull. Thompson, while running away
from Murphy at Woodward's Pavilion
on Wednesday night, stumbled and
fell, the back of his head striking
against the ground. Murphy is being
detained at the City Prison, but no
charge has been made against him. It
was reported yesterday afternoon that
Thompson's father was to apply for a
warrant for Murphy's arrest for man
slaughter, but he did not do so.

ENJOYING TRIP
TO THIS COAST
HOTEL. DEL CORONADO. Jan. 27.â
Among the prominent guests here are
officials high in the councils of the
Santa Fe, arriving in their private
car on their regular winter visit to the
Pacific Coast. The party includes
George T. Nicholson, general passen
ger traffic manager; W. B. Biddle,
general freight traffic manager; W. A.
Bissell, assist traffic manager, with
headquarters in San Francisco, and
John J. Byrne, general passenger agent
of the road's western division. With
them are C. T. Atkinson of Chicago,
president of the Western Golf Associa
tion; H. B. Chase, president of the
Fruit-Packers' Association, and H, T.
Evan* of Chicago.
While the affairs of the railroad are
in good shape these officials have jour
neyed to the West to enjoy golf, where
alone it can be played with comfort
at this season of the year. They tried
out the links of the Country Club on
the San Diego side of the bay when
they first came, and have been out on
the Coronado links daily ever since. A
few days at their pastime and they will
return again to their desks and their
work-
Mr. and Mrs. Herman Shalnewald
are back at the hotel after two years'
absence. One year was spent abroad,
most of the time in Nice. Nice has been
noted as one of the principal resorts
of Southern Europe, and yet Mr.
Shalnewald says its climate does not
compare with that of Coronado. Both
he and his wife frequently wished for
Southern California, instead of South
ern France, during the time they were
abroad.
Charles S. Aiken, the editor of "Sun
set," is enjoying a vacation this week
at the big hotel.

fact that in the annual handicap race
the boats which finished in the first

RAIN PREVENTS
TENNIS PLAY
Causes Postponement of the
Various Tournaments on
Schedules of the Clubs
LADIES AGAIN ACTIVE
Sixteen Clever Eacket Wield -
ers Will Compete To-Day
in Golden Gate Park
The weather during- the last three
weeks has permitted but little play, on
the tennis courts and the tournaments
scheduled have had to be postponed.
The annual handicap singles tourna
ment of the Golden Gate Tennis Club
was to have commenced two weeks
ago. Wet Weather has caused two
postponements and the third attempt to
start the affair will be made to-mor
â¢row. owing to the large entry list it is
expected at least three Sundays will be
necessary to complete the event. The
entries closed two weeks ago when the
handicaps were arranged and tha
drawing held. The handicapper has
given tne poorer players less considera
tion than usual and a majority of the
eight prizes will be carried oft by the
better players. The men who look to
have the best chance to win are the
Baker brothers, George Janes, Carl
Gardiner, M. Long, H. Gabriel and C
Griffin. #
The handicap singles tournament* to
be played to-day on the park courts by
the members of the Ladies' Annex
looks to be the most promising event
held since the club's reorganization.
Sixteen of the cleverest players will
compete and the handicaps look to be
better than usual. It is the fourth
tournament tor the Cochran Cup.
Miss Crocker has won the trophy
once and Miss Van Vliet twice. Both
players have been set back by the
handicapper. Despite this fact, those
in a position to know figure the only
player Miss Van Vliet has to fear is
Miss Wegener. The latter is the most
heavily handicapped player In the
tournament. She will play from "owe
15 3-6" as usual. Miss Van Vliet will
be on the "owe 15 2-6" mark. Both
players should have been put on the
same mark, as "owe 1-6" is practically
no handicap at all.
Besides the Cochan Cup there will be
a three-time cup for the runner-up.
Cups of this kind will also be put up
in the handicap deubles events.
The six cups which the directors of
the California Tennis Club authorized
Dr. Lovegrove and. Dr. Hill to purchase
have been bought and the tournament
committee will meet to-morrow and
draw up a schedule. Four of the troph
ies are for class singles tournaments
and two for handicap doubles events.
The latter will probably be the first
tournament played. The class tourna
ments will be played one class on each
Sunday until completed.
The tournament committee will have
considerable trouble classifying the
players. If the continuous tournament
had been running longer this task
would be much easier. The first class
will probably be split up and some of
the players put In the second class. At
present there are but four players in
this class.
The only match played during the
week in the continuous tournament
was an unfinished one between Herbert
Long and Harold Gabriel. The latter
won the first set easily and led at 5-2
and 40-15 in the second, but Long took
five games straight and set. Long has
gone back considerably of late, while
Gabriel is improving.

Hoffman did some remarkable volley
ing for a woman. She la comaderab'v
out of practice, but played surprisiEglv
well st the net. Aside from the Sut
tons Miss Hall is easily one of the best
three players on the coast. She was
undefeated until she met Miss May
Sutton, who outclassed her. Miss Hall
lacks Miss Sutton's physical strength,
but is by no means short oa skill.

CORRIGAN SEEMS SANGUINE
OF THE NEW CLUB'S SUCCESS
Racing Magnate Does Not Anticipate
Any Move by the Western
Jockey Clnb.
. â¢ CHICAGO, Jan. 27.âEd Corrigan, the
leader in the organization of tha Amer
ican Jockey Club, arrived here to-day
from Memphis and Hot Springs. He
had nothing to give out regarding the
impending turf war and said he did not
anticipate any move being made by
the Western Jockey Club.
**We had a meeting at Hot Springs
and everything went off just as we
fcxpected," he said. "Horsemen there
are all. with us, and we expect to havo
a successful meeting at New Orleans
as soon as Essex Park is closed. I
know nothing about tracks in Indiana,
and never saw Roby track in my life.
I have rfo leases there, and do not think
th's Western Jockey Club is back of any
track down there."
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Jan. 27.âA bill
which will end racing in Illinois, ac
cording to its introducer, S. E. Erick
son of Chicago, was presented to the
House to-day. It makes it a crime to
take bets or sell pools on any contest
of speed or skill anywhere in the State,
whether on racetracks or fair incis
ures or otherwise.
"The present law does not apply to
bookmakers who operate in inclosed
tracks." said Erickson. "Skilled gam
bling men have told me the track book
makers cannot be touched under it.
Fair and racing association grounds
are exempt from its provisions."
â¢ The bill was introduced several years
ago and gqfc through the House, but
was smothered in the Senate.
Bull Terrier Club Formed.
The Pacific Bull Terrier Club was
organized last night in Judge Van

Adherents of Fighting Dick
Seem to Expect a Long;
Price for Their Money j
â¦
The backers of Dick Hyland were j
congratulating themselves some days
since in anticipation of securing 10 to
4 for their money on his meeting with
Neil. They are still jingling their gold
en twenties and waiting for this price,
which the followers of Nell do not seem j
inclined to give. Some good Judges of ,
price think the bulk of the money will j
be wagered at 10 to 6 and 10 to 7.
Hyland s work In training has been j
impressive and has won him many ad 4 i
mirers. He is a firm youngster on his
feet, never having been knocked down
in his long career as an amateur. He
glides about somewhat after the fash
ion of Fitzsimmons' famous shuffle, and
seems to maintain his balance and his
hitting powers In any position. He
shifted his work yesterday, boxing in
the morning with Jack McCormick. his
trainer, and going on the road in the
afternoon. He touched the reauired
weight, 122 pounds, yesterday. The per
sons who have boxed with him all ex- i
press surprise at his punching power.
Some go so far as to say he can out- j
hit a middleweight.
Nell is still working like a Trojan, I
although he is in the best possible con- I
dition. The little bantam is constantly
on the go, and Trainer McDonald has
to continually caution him about the
possibility of overtraining.
Frankie seems a bunch of nerves, and
from morning till night he Is grinding |
away either in the gymnasium or on
the road. Yesterday morning he and
Jimmie Rothwell took saddle-horses I
and enjoyed a long ride in the moun
tains. In the afternoon a large crowd
of sporting men visited the camD to
watch Frankie, and all were Immensely
pleased with his work. Among those
present were Tim McGrath, Spider Kel
ly and Barney Bernard. Frankie worked
for more than an hour, but his breath
ing was not visibly afTected. Four fast
rounds with the punching bag were in
dulged in, and the spectators present
who have not seen Frankie go lately
were surprised at his auickness.
Frankie has always been a whirlwind,
but the improvement in form recently
shown is surprising. Frankie. though
not overconfident, is sure of being de
clared the victor over Fighting Dick. He
says he has been up against some
tough propositions and therefore has
no fear of his opponent.
Trainer McDonald has ordered Neil
to ease up work to-day, as he wants
the little fighter to take on weight.
Frankie will probably enter the ring
weighing about 118 pounds.
STANFORD BASEBALL MEN
TO PLAY PRACTICE GAME
Will Meet the Crack Nino of the
Santa Clara College on Let
ter's Diamond.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 27.
The Stanford baseball team will play
Santa Clara College at Santa Clara to
morrow afternoon for the first prelimi
nary game of the season. Coach Cow
den has selected fifteen of the most
likely baseball candidates and each of
these men will be given a trial in the
game. The men who will make the
trip are: CatchersâStott, Daily; first
base, Colbert; second base, Lewis;
third baseâFenton, Presley; shortstop,
Trowbridge; outfieldersâDudley, Luce,
Chalmers and Cadwalader; pitchersâ
Sales, Thiele, Menardi and Rook.
The outlook for a fast baseball team
,at Stanford this year is not as bright
,as could be wished for. While there
are a large number of candidates on
the field, few of them are players of
experience and Coach Cowden will be
compelled to build up a team from
men who must be coached in every de
tail of play. There are four veterans
of last year's nine in college. These
are Captain Trowbridge, shortstop;
Colbert, first base; Chalmers, left field,
and Sales, pitcher. With these men
forming a nucleus Coach Cowden will
try to develop a hitting team this year.
Nightly batting practice, with games
each Saturday, will be the programme
during the rest of the season.

M. Tobin. Captain de Crespigny scored
two for the Whites, while Paul Clag
stone and Cyril Tobin each made one.
An important match for a set of
four cups will be played to-morrow
on Mr. Clark's field. This is the saf
est field on whicrj to play after a rain,
hence its selection. F. J. Mackey is
sending a carload of polo ponies up
from t#e south for the use of the
English players.
Cardinal Men on the Track.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 27.
The track season at Stanford Univer
sity will be formally opened to-morrow
by an interdepartment field day, which
will be held on the oval at 10 o'clock.
This meet will give Trainer "Dad"
Moulton the first real opportunity for
comparing the merits of the 'many
new candidates which have entered
college this year. The greatest inter
est centers In the 100-yard dash, the
mile run, the quarter-mile, the half
mile, the shotput .and the pole vault.
In the 100-yard dash Cope, G. Gartz
mann and W T oods are showing good
form. Miller's work in the distance
promises to be sensational and the
cardinal will depend upon him to win
both the mile and the half-mile in the
intercollegiate field day with Califor
nia. Horton, who is also a freshman,
is "doing splendid work In the shot
put, averaging forty feet this early in
the season. _

Rough One Tries to Call
Jere Dunn Down, but Vet
eran Wins the Argument
Lew Powell's good straight left Jabp
stood between Bob Cairns and victory
last night at Woodward's Pavilion, The
brindle-halred lad had his punches
timed to a nicety, and he never lost an
opportunity to shoot them in "at- the
right time, Powell and Cairns starred
In the main event of a seven-bout show
âthe first exhibition under the auspices
of the Hawthorne Club.
Cairns hardly laid a glove on his â¢
crafty opponent for three rounds. {
When the fourth opened the former j
Olympian began to wade In, and rough J
going marked the affair from that time I
till the bell ended It all. Cairns brought
his right and left over to the head sev
eral times, and Powell was well on the
way toward the fading point. A couple
of game rallies saved him, however,
and he finished strongly, forcing Cairns
and landing rapidly with rights and
lefts.
"Rough House" McDonald did not
like the verdict of Judge Jere Dunn
when Frank Mayfield was declared a
winner over him. "Rough House"
strode over to where Dunn waa sitting
and tried to tell the latter he did not
know the fighting game. Jere was right
there with the comeback, and after he
had silenced McDonald he got the gal
lery's cheers.
McDonald tried to force Mayfield, but
the latter met all his rushes and fought
his man toe to toe. The fight was
even enough up to the last round, when
Mayfield did a lot of good work, bring
ing several stiff ones over. It was on
this showing the judges gave him the
verdict, which looked good to every one
but McDonald.
Harry Tenny*s customary volley of
blows caused Frank Edwards to toss
out distress signals In two rounds.
When Tenny had him In the corner Ed
wards laid down and refused to rise. ,
Harry Baker and Eddie Kehoe put
jup a fast, clever mill. Baker had his
j left working the way he wanted it, and
j Kehoe was unable to ward It' off. /'
Jack Kane made a tramp out of
I Charlie Dunn for fphr rounds, sending
: his left In and occasionally bringing
the right up, while - Dunn rushed wildly
around the ring waiting for something
to happen.
Young'Dempsey outroughed and out
boxed George Curran and got a. merited
decision. Jack Keegan knew less about
the game than did Pete Sullivan, so the
referee stopped the bout in the,second

MERCHANTS CHARGE FRAUD
IN SETTLEMENT OF FAILURE
Suit for Accounting Against B. J.
Harris Alleges That He Conspired
With Bankrupts.
Out of the failure of Levin Bros,, gro
cers, in January, T903, has grown a suit
charging fraud against one of the trus
tees appointed by the Board of Trade
to settle the affairs. It was begun yes
terday by J. H. Newbauer & Co. against
Benjamin J. Harris as an individual
and Harris Bros. & Co. The Levins
owed Newbauer $1051 and owed Harris
$4400. Harris was not a member of the
Board of Trade, but signed the agree
ment for settlement and was appointed
one of the three trustees. The other
debts of the firm amounted to about
$20,000.
It Is charged in the suit that Harris
knew beforehand of the financial con
dition of Levin Bros, and of the value
of their stock; also that after he be
came trustee he entered into a con
spiracy with Levin Bros, and Marcus
Wolf to recommend a settlement for 35
cents on the dollar. It is alleged that
for this he was to receive additional
payment from the bankrupts, and did
get a note from them for $1760, upon
which he is said to have collected $1600
or more. The plaintiffs demand an ac
counting.
Burglars Keep Busy.
" The liquor store of E. Campion at
20 Leidesdorff street was entered by
burglars early yesterday morning. Six
bottles of champagne, two bottles of
white wine and $5 cash were stolen.
Entrance was effected by breaking a
pane of glass. The store of Piaso
& Thompson, 628 Mission street, was
entered by some one climbing through
a rear window and $6 in silver taken
from the cash register. The room of
Mrs. Annie Smith, 805% Howard
street, was entered and a gold watch,
valued at $20, a phonograph and rec
ords stolen. _
Sam Alople and Peter Rala, fisher
men, who were detained as witnesses
in connection with the killing of Joe
Erogedo on Vandewater street on Sun
day night by Andrea Bazilio, were
booked at the City Prison yesterday
afternoon on a charge of perjury by
Detective T. B. Gibson, Policeman
Fenner and Special Policeman Stone.
It is alleged that they committed per
jury while testifying at the Coroner's
inquest on Wednesday, Attorney
Splnetti at once obtained a writ of
habeas corpus for Rala's release. The
â writ was made returnable before Judge
Cook this morning. â¢

Deep, heavy going proved too much
for the black horse, San Nicholas, fav
orite for the six and a half furlong
handicap yesterday at Oakland. He
' did the best he could for Jakle Jones
3 and his 122-pound impost and then re-
I tired to the show position.
| Ishlana, a 107 pounder/piloted by Mc-
Bride, and third choice In the betting,
passed both the favorite and Sals in the
stretch, leading the latter out not quite
a length. Matt Hogan and Romaine
ran below expectations.
Once more were four favorites laid
low. The betting and attendance were
all that could be desired.
The combined weight of the coin bet
on Golden Jdol to win the opening five
furlong scramble would have given the
French cruiser Protet a decided list to
| starboard. Backed from fours down to
7 to 5 favoritism, the good thing made
the sketch a hit by describing a grape
vine route, and then winning by two
winks and a sneeze.
Spondoolix, a green bird from the
Jones & Lusk stable, took the place,
quoted at 16 to L Grenore, the early
pacemaker, lasted long enough to beat
Mogregor for the show.
INSTRUMENT A WINNER.
Instrument, the musical prodigy, put
his name down for the second purse,
which he also took under his wing later
oh. Last Wednesday Instrument re
ceived backing and ran like a water
logged sea biscuit floating down the
Brannan street sewer. On that occasion
he was played. Yesterday, when every
body supposed him to be six cards be
low the cut, he loomed up like a stake
horse. Pickaway, the favorite, ran
three furlongs out In front with Sir
Preston, when he was attacked with
failure of the pedigree. Sir Preston did
his best and was then easily put to
sleep by Instrument, astride which Ala
rie rode a race that should entitle his
picture to a place in the national me
morial art gallery. Sam Greeneld on
Lady Kent picked a route that ulti
mately landed the mare in the show.
Ed Tlerney'S Mr. Dingle was held in
some respect until Formero finished

TWO FIRE CAPTAINS ARE
AT VARIANCE OVER REPORT
Ewing AsSed to Explain Why Ho De
layed a Truck Company When
Alarm Was Given.
Captain George Ewing of Chemical
Engine No. 7, who was charged with
having Impeded with his team the
exit of Fire Truck No. 7 from the flre
house when a second alarm was
turned in last Monday, was tried by
the Fire Commissioners yesterday.
Captain Carew of Truck No. 7 re
ported the alleged breach of discipline
to Assistant Chief Shaughnessy, who
suspended Ewing pending trial. Wit
nesses for both sides were examined.
Two or three minutes were said to
have been lost by the truck company
on account of the chemical failing to
move out of the firehouse, giving the
truck the right of way. Instead Ew
ing is reported to have backed his
chemical within the house and the
truck could not drive out. The cap
tain explained that it was raining and
he did not want to expose his horses
and the chemical to the weather un
necessarily. The matter has been tak
en under advisement by the Commis
sioners.
The matter of passing upon the bids
for automobiles for the department
was referred to Chief Sullivan and
Master Mechanic Kenny.
The recommendation of Chief Sul
livan that two additional battalion
chiefs be appointed was passed upon
favorably. The city has added so
much to Its area of buildings, said
the Chief, that it is necessa* td give
the betterment of the FireVDepart
ment serious consideration. The Chief
recommended Captain Michael
O'Brien of Engine Company No. 2 and
Captain John R. Maxwell of Engine
Company No. 28 for promotion. His
recommendtions were accepted.
Master Mechanic Kenny was told to
make careful inquiry into the reports
of men of the corporation yard in
which they excuse themselves from
absence from duty on the grounds of
sickness.

be construed, won the race, but he did
beat Mr. Dingle, a VÂ£ to 1 favorite.
The latter had no apologias to offer.

which could not beat the Los Angeles
ring prices, passed him before the
stretch was reached and, hard ridden
by Knapp, Just stalled off the belated j
rush of Wright, astride Formero.
FAVORITE HARD TO FIND.
It would have taken Captain Forsee
and his entire Plnkerton force to pick
out which was' entitled to be ternled fa
vorite for the mile ana fifty yard sell
ing number. The winner turned up in
Blackthorn, which horse always looked
a winner, and disposed of the pace
maker Vlgoroso without effort at the
end. Bonner, on Mr. Farnum, ran Into
the show.
P. Ryan's crack mare Honiton had to
be ridden out in the final seven-furlong
purse event to down the 40 to 1 shot
Soufriere a neck. It looked such a cer
tainty for Honiton that 9 to 20 was
about the best the books displayed.
She made all the running, but tired
perceptibly and seemed to be all in at
the f nish. Miller laid away In the last
position with the outsider until reach
ing the. stretch, when he made a tardy
move. Gateway lost the place by less
than a length.

DARING BURGLAR MAKES
VALUABLE DIAMOND HAUL
Enters Apartment of Mrs. Jane Har
vey and Succeeds in Looting
Jewelry and Money.
A daring burglar entered the apart
ments of Mrs. Jane Harvey at 1052 Ellis
street on Wednesday evening while she
was in the dining-room and carried
away Jewelry and other valuables
worth more than $1000. The arrival of
visitors prevented the .thief from taking
more, as was evident from the fact
that half the silver toilet set waa left
behind. There appears to have been
no witness to the work and the police
have no clews.
The dining-room is at the end of a
long hall leading from the bedroom,
where entrance was effected, and it was
possible for the thief to work undis
turbed, although several people were In
the house at the time. The window of
the bedroom looks out on a dark alley
way that separates the house from the
adjoining one, and is about twelve feet
from the sidewalk. Through this the
burglar entered, after lifting the sash
and knotting back the curtains.
On the chiffonier lay a silver Jewel
case containing gold lorgnettes inlaid
with diamond orchids, a gold snake
buckle with diamond eyes, a locket
with a diamond fleur-de-lis, a gold
watch and chain and' several silver
trinkets. From the bureau drawer a
purse containing $30 and many toilet
articles bearing Mrs. Harvey's mono
gram were taken. The robbery was re
ported to Captain Burnett, and Detec
tive Ryan is working on the case.
Insane Woman Wants Property.
In Judge Murasky's court yesterday
a hearing was begun involving the title
of Honors Johnston, an Inmate of Ag
news Asylum since 1893, to $7000 worth
of property on Sacramento street, near
Spruce. The present claimants are Po
lice Sergeant Richard F. Bidwill and
Mrs. Emmeline L. Bates. The title has
been insured by two title insurance
companies for $7000, and they are par
ties to the suit, as is also the Pacific
Paving Company. Attorney Arthur
Barendt. representing the insane wom
an, contends that the property, which
was sold ur a few hundred dollars for
assessment, belongs to his client, Inas
much as there was a defect In the fore
closure suit, which was directed against
the woman's guardian instead of her
self.

109 MONTGOMERY ST.
City Lots Accurately and Officially Surveye*.
CHARGES REASONABLE.
My field books, diagrams show, by actual
measurements, the exact points from which
your lot was surveyed, which is Imperatively
necessary, as the City Surveyor and other sur
veyors do not show that, and also because all
the original monuments were taken out when
the streets were formed In the early days of
the city, since which time the different City
Surveyors, extending to the present time, have
made innumerable errors in their street and
lot surveys, and to conceal such errors they
have moved the monument lines away from
their original correct positions without legal
authority from the people, causing blocks and
streets to measure Incorrectly, creating excess
measurements in blocks of the most valuable
portion of the city, which they do not distrib
ute proportionately throughout the block, but
often give the entire excess of sometimes 12
Inches or more to one person, thereby interfer
ing with the deed distances of the people and
the absolute security of boundary lines.
Consult me before moving your valuable
buildings on such unfair surveys. Work guar
anteed.

APPROVE GRAND
JURORS' WORK
Clergy men and Laymen Meet
to Offer 'Encouragement
to Campaign Against Vice
More than twenty clergymen and lay
men met in the assembly hall of the
Mills building yesterday to express
their commendation of the work of the
present Grand Jury and to effect a-per
manent organization, the object of
which shall be to help enforce the laws
of this city. Secrecy akin to that ob
served by the Grand Jury was enforced.
The work of the Grand Jury against
the notorious resorts at 620 Jackson
street, 1129 Dupont stret and Belden
place was the foremost subject before
the gathering. A public demonstration
against Judge Cook, who issued an in
junction to prevent the closing of these
resorts, was proposed in a vague way,
but no action was taken. Father Cara
her. the well-known antagonist of no
torious resorts, spoke forcibly against
the granting of injunctions for the pro
tection of such places.
The Grand Jury received praise from
nearly all the speakers. Rev. George
W. White commended it for "getting
after graÂ»ft at all times." It was sug
gested that the preachers present speak
to their congregations on the subject
and ask that the Grand Jury be sup
ported in its efforts. The Merchants'
Association was praised for its work in
the ballot-stuffing cases. Fairfax
Wbeelan of that association said he
was not sure that another organization
was needed to fight the administration,
but he declared that the time was ripe
for the enforcement of law. He scored
the administration, declaring that it
should be overthrown, and said that
the time had come to down it.
The subject of high liquor license was
touched upon by C. A. Murdoch. The
gathering expressed a favorable opinion
on the movement.
A committee was appointed to draft
by-laws and to effect a permanent or
ganization. Another committee will be
named to ferret out crime and to prose
cute it. The committee on organization
consists of Rev. O. W. White, J. E.
White, Rev. H. H. Bell, Rev. J..S.
Thomas, H. J. McCoy, Rev. Father
Caraher, W. G. French, J. W. Hatch
and C. A. Murdock.
Rev. George W. White was elected
chairman of the assoclatjon and J. B.
White secretary. The next meeting will
be called by the committee.

The New York wires of B. H. Hutton A
Co. yesterday said:
STOCKSâ"Market was erratic, but decidedly .
strong to-day. Considerable excitement and ;
buoyancy were seen at times, but there were
also" periods of weakness. One of the latter |
was In evidence tn the afternoon, and with a
vigorous slump tn Copper the whole market |
but there was big buying on the de- j
. oline and a vary sharp recovery followed, the i
close being very strong. The break in Cop- j
pcjr waa attributed to new Dawson rifrnors.
The Homestead mills of the United States |
Steer Corporation hereafter will be operated j
day and night seven days a week, because of
the rush of orders.
Speculation continues almost entirely pro
fessional, but fundamental conditions are tnor- j
Â©ughly sound, and the Improvement In the for
elgri situation Is the basis for a somewhat f
Sore. confident feeling regarding the future. (
oney continues excessively easy, and the ex- \
port of $5,500,000 tn gold during the past
Week has attracted only passing attention.
There does not appear to be anything ahead
Of the market that Is distinctly unfavorable,
god the indications point to ultimately higher
prices, but we continue to advlee the purchase
Â«f good- stocks on the reactions. Reports of
foreign bankers here believe the political crisis
,ts nearly over and that more peaceful condi
tions will be witnessed in the future. The
strength of foreign exchange to-day indicated
a demand for gold by Paris, and the shipping
Of $3,500,000 gold to Paris shows that that
plftce Is preparing for any emergency that
may arlaa"
â¢ COTTONâThe Cotton market is narrow and
almost entirely professional, and sentiment on
the- .whole favors the bear side. Developments
.-.ln-the future may bring about a decline to a
â â¢new low level, but any break to 6%e or below
' 'should Justify' buying for a turn of moderate
For the time being, however, a
â¢scalping position for moderate- turns would
' appear to hold out the greatest opportunity for
profits. Print cloth markets are very" active.
There is much better demand from Fall River.
COFFEEâIt .Is noted that whenever a de
mand develops, no matter how slight, the mar
ket -readily responds, and from this it ie be
lieved quite a short interest has been created
during the recent heavy selling. No lmpor
â¢ tant price movement is expected for some time,
or until the much-looked-for falling off In re
ceipts takes aiace.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Jan. 27.âThe upward course
of -prices, In the stock market, which set in
continued quite brukly this morn
ing and the market for a time sho.vÂ«d
strength anJ breadth. Considerable buying for
account helped to this end. But the
f the demand seemed to be spent toward
' the latter part of the day. and there was a
i table falling off In the volume of dealings
and â¢soma reactions In prices. The news of
â no explanatlor for the dying out of the
'.<:â  r.d but the fact was noticeable that the
...r : v had about made up average losses of
'~ tlrti" earlier of the week. The demand
.hestfated at al-cut the recovered level. The
'' ff-Ht'ire of ihe latter part of the day waa the
. ler?e number of Industrials of all claa*es
which -were pushed upward successively. The
â¢ .minor Iron and steel stocks and those of trades
allied, with the metal Industry were especially
conspicuous in the movement. Equally con
spicuous- was the fact that the premier In
! d'iÂ«trials, the United States Steel stocks and
â¢Amalgamated Copper, were heavy and laggards
'4n 'the movement. The- same was true of the
:â¢ 'electrics "and smelting stocks. This led to the
inference that profits were being sought on the
recent advance In these major Industrials under
covei o{ the movement In the minor Indus -
â¢ trial?. The ultimate yielding of Amalgamated
Copper tb the realizing pressure sharpened this
suspicion. The advance of Northern Securi
ties on the curb to a new high record stimu
lated the strength In the Harrlman stocks,
and Erie kept up Its accompanying movement
as for some time past. Reading's strong state,
ment of December net earnings was a helpful
factor* for the.coalers. Railroad earnings re
ports" otherwise were helpful to stocks.' The
entering upon the stage of rate-cutting of the
dispute over export grain traffic of the Atlantic
and the.gulf ports was regarded with dissatis
faction. â  The settlement of the Interborough
Rapid Transit labor question helped the local
tractions. The appointment of a receiver for
the Standard Rope and Twine Company was
so entirely Ignored as to arouse curious com
parisons . with the market effect of episodes
In the cgreer of predecessors of that corpora
tion. -Uncertainty over to-morrow's bank
statement added to the hesitation of the late
. market. The receipts of currency on balance
from the. Interior seem sufficient to about off
set the.export of gold, although to-morrow's
fold shipments will not figure In the bank
Statement. Seme slight gain is therefore ex
pected in the cash item, but the loan item Is
again a mystery. It is considered probable
that last week's record expansion may have a
' counterpart In this week's statement. The
compilation of the reports of condition of the !
city trust companies on December 21 seems j
to throw: light on the movement of bank loans, j
Compared with June 80 preceding, the trust f
companies have increased their deposits over
â¢125,000,000* while the cash to their account
In banks had been reduced $53,674,404. The
trust company â¢ loans for the same period were
Increased $231,476,762. With the profitable
money rate for the last of the year it is clear
that â¢ the trust companies were lending out
their own deposits Instead of leaving them In
the banks. With the decline in money rates
since the first of the year it is equally clear
fTiat the trust companies have made enor
mous red epos! t s In the banks, which have had
tho responsibility of finding use for the funds,
upon which they must pay the trust com
panies 2 per cent. The condition of the week's
â  money market makes probable a further enor
mous taking over of loans by the banks from
the trust companies. The late break In sym
pathy with Amalgamated Copper was partly
retrieved. Erie leading the rally again, as In
th<Â» previous upward tendency. The closing
was firm.
Bonds were firm. Total sales, $6,425,000.
United States threes declined % per cent on
call.

Future Grain and Provisions.
- CHICAGO. Jan. 87.âWith the exception of %
short- period of strength near the. middle Vt
too session, sentiment in the waeat pit was
! quite bearish. by lower prices at
Liverpool, following increased shipments from
| Argentina, initial quotations here showed de
; cljnes, May being off %o%c atlsl 16%0
I 1 16%. A factor that contributed to the weak
-1 nese was the more liberal movement in the
; Northwest receipts, to-day's being fifty-three
; cars greater than were received the corre-
I spending day a year ago. Later a firmer tone
i developed on news from the Northwest and
I Southwest. St. Louis reported good-siaed sales
I of Wheat for shipment to Southeastern millers,
i Advices from Minneapolis told of Increased
; sales of flour and or higher prices paid by thÂ»
: millers Reports from Portland, Ore., claimed
'. that the market there was in line with export
bids and that some business had already been
i dono In that dlreotlon. A sale of 100,000
I barrels of flour for Japan was among the Pa-
I ciflc Coast items. The market readily re
' fponded and Mey advanced to $1 16%. The
strength was only temporary, however, the
market soon becoming weak on general profit
takfng. The market closed weak, with May at
Isl 15%.
I Predictions that through rate* on grain from
! M tscril River points would giÂ«atly lncreese
arrivals here bad a weakening effect on the
I corn market. May opened %Â®%c lower at

A heavy undertone with a downward ten
dency of prices existed in the oat pit. May
closed practically unchanged at 81 %c.
I A 10c decline In ho* prices, following llb

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT âThe foreign markets were not ma
terially changed. Chicago was a cent lower.
The Modern Miller said that a large portion
of the winter Wheat belt was unprotected dur
ing the recent cold snap, but that no damage
has yet been reported.
Advices to E B. Cutter A Co. tram Chicago
said: "Argentine shipment* large. Shorts are
well la. There Is heavy realizing."
The Chicago letter of E. F. Hutton A Co.
said:
"Cash markets continue to report a good
demand for Wheat. -Kansas City says samples
cleaned upâbest market for ten days. Lower
Northwestern markets caused opening loss of
%c to %c India cables and larger Argentine
shipments contributed to bring about an easier
feeling. The reaction to-day is only natural,
considering the slow market. It continues to
be a good trading market, with moderate
swings in either dlreotlon. We Still believs
the short interest is large and stubborn. While
trade has broadened out somewhat, it Is still
a narrow market and easily responds to any
little buying demand."
This market was lower as to future*, with
larger sales. The cash grain showed no
Changs.

BARLEY âThe feeling in this market con

was again active. The cash grain for the
regular trade was quiet but a sale of 5000
sacks at $1 21% was reported, though this
figure was considered over the general market.
The statistical position of Barley is strong, as
a large exporting bouse is actively buying
large lines In the interior and, as stocks an
over the State are known to be light, the feel
ing among operators le very bullish, most of
them predicting still higher prices. Chevalier

STOCK MARKET.
Continued Activity on the Different
Local Exchanges.
Yesterday was another active day oa the-
Stock and Bond Exchange, and there was con
siderable fluctuation, though the change* as a
1 rule were not wide. The sharpest vaitatlm
| was In Contra Costa Water, which advanced
'. from 830 37 % to $32. The Improvement in this
! stock was attributed to a belief that the re
| suit of the bond election in Oakland March 11
' to decide upon the proposed acquisition by that
i city of the plant of the Bay Cities Water Com
pany will not be prejudicial to the Interests of
the Contra Costa Company. The buying or
ders for the stock predominated over the sell
ing orders, hence the advance. The contrary
case prevailed in Alaska Packers. Free sell
ing orders In this stock appeared and the quo
tations fell back several fractions. The sugars
continued in active demand and firm, with
Hutchinson higher at 518 and Makawell $1 50
higher at $39 50. The other sugars were very
steady as a rule, with plenty of buying orders
clipping out every minute or two. Honolulu
Plantation sold up to $40 50 and Honolulu Pool
to $41.
The Tonopah Mining stocks continued active,
with a smart little rise In MacNamara to 48a,
the others ruling firm. The Comstocks were
also firm, with Ophlr selling up to $7.
The Osceola Copper Mining Company paid a
semi-annual dividend of $2 per share yester
day. This is $1 per share more than paid six
months ago.
The regular annual meeting of the stock
holders of the California Title Insurance and
Trust Company has been called for February U.
The Pullman Company has declared a regular
quarterly dividend of $2 per share, payable
February 15.
The regular annual meeting of the stock
holders of the Pacific Rolling Mill Company
has been called for February 1.
The directors of the Bank of Italy Of thU
city have called upon stockholders to pay in
another installment of the capital in the form
of an assessment of $10 per share on the capi
tal stock, delinquent February 26.

JUDGE DENIES
UNION CHARGES
Superior Judge J. C. B. Hebbard yes
terday granted the motions of the bak
ery unions to transfer to some other
court for hearing the cases of Swain's
and Thorp & Co.. wherein it is sought"
to restrain the labor organizations from |
pursuance uf their boycotting tactics.
The affidavits charging the Judge j
with bias and prejudice, upon which j
the motions for transfer were based, i
were answered by Judge Hebbard in an ;
affidavit in which he denied imputed j
antagonism to'unionism and declared j
that the defendants In these cases
could have a fair trial in his court. He j
also averred that, though the charges j
were not within the statutes relating
to the disqualification of Judges, he
would grant the motions as further evi
dence that he was not biased. He
frankly admitted that, both as a citizen
and a Judge, he is opposed to boycotts.
In substance Judge Hebbard's affi
davit relates that for fourteen years
last past he has been and now is a
Judge of the Superior Court. His
father-in-law, Charles Schroth, now de
ceased, owned a bakery, confectionery
and restaurant business, and at the
present time, the Judge believes, sev
eral of his brothers-in-law own stock
In that kind of business.
Neither he nor his wife ever had any <
interest, directly or indirectly, except
as above stated, in such business. He
never gave any counsel or advice to
any of his relatives by marriage con
cerning the defendants or kindred *>r
ganlzations, and more than two years
ago he refused to have assigned to his
court a case involving the rights of
bakery employes then on strike, as he
remembers, because one of his broth
ers-in-law held an important place on
an employers' committee having the
suit in charge.
Judge Hebbard affirms that he never
made use of the language attributed to
him in the defendants' affidavits, nor
did he ever express himself as antago
nistic to labor unions generally nor to
any organization of persons assisting
therein. "On the contrary," says the
affidavit, he believes such organizations
have a right to exist and have protec
tion upder the law, provided the or
ganizations themselves submit to and
obey the law. And continuing, "affiant
admits that, both as a citizen and a
Jqdge, he is opposed to all forms of
"boycotts," and that the excerpts from
his opinion in the case of Goldberg,
Bowen'& Co. against the Stablemen's
Union are correctly stated, but the
opinion was not worded because of any
hjas or prejudice. He has, he says, no
prejudice .in this caÃe and could give it
a fair trial under the facts and the
Javf, and to show that there is no preju
dice, and although the issues of fact
and law made up in this motion do not
cfcktne within the code provision relating
to> the. disqualification of Judges, he
will grant the motion to transfer.
â¢Supporting the affidavit of the Judge
â¢was one by F. A. Swain, plaintiff in one
Of. the suits for injunction. The affi
davit* of the defendants had entered at
length into a statement of the purity
of purpose of the unions. Swain denies
that the sole purpose of the unions is
*q better the condition of the laboring
man and protect him from the abuse of
unreasonable employers.
. "He says that he was waited upon by
a..committee which demanded the dis
charge of three old and faithful em
ployes, who had been removed from the
unions because they refused to take
their meals at a restaurant other than
Swain's. The affiant declares that the
tiqlons may have sought with others to
lighten the burdens of the men by
meeting employers in a fair and honor
able way. but so far-as he was con
cerned they never employed such meth
ods, but have attempted to gain con
cessions by intimidation.

LEE TOY TELLS
HIS HISTORY
.Tudge de Haven announced yesterday
morning at the opening of the United
States District Court that he would
deny the motions made on the preced
ing day to strike out all the testimony
of the slave girls Leung Ah Duck, Lee
Gum Kew, Yuen Tsoy Fong and Chun
Ho relating to conversations had be
tween them and Le Toy and Da Sllva
on board the steamship Doric on the
way from China to this city. The
court also denied the motion to in
struct the jury to acquit.
Judge de Haven said that in deny
ing the motions he did not wish to be
understood as expressing any opinion
whatever as to the merits of the case.
Ho wished to be understood simply as
ruling that there was sufficient evi
dence to carry the case to the jury.
Lee Toy, one of the defendants, was
then placed on the stand by his counsel,
Bert Schlesipger and Samuel M. Short
ridge. Lee Toy was dressed in Ameri
can costume, without a queue and
spoke in English without the aid of an
interpreter. He said that he was 47
years old and had a wife and two chil
dren in Philadelphia, where he had
been in business for twenty-seven years
as a merchant in Chinese and Japanese
goods and curios. He produced papers
showing that he had been awarded the
concession for the Chinese Village at
the St. Louis Exposition, whereby he
was bound to expend at least $100,000 In
fitting up the village and to import
from China not less than 200 nor more
than 500 Chinese men and women to
people the village and portray the typi
cal Chinese life. He assigned this con
cession to the Chinese Village Com
pany, and as president of the company
went to China to procure the people
necessary. He was still in Hongkong
when the court adjourned for the day.
Dr. R. J. Huston, ship's surgeon on
board the Doric, testified that two of
the complainant slave girls became in
toxicated on the voyage and fell to
fighting and that he had been called by
Lee Toy and Da Silva to dress the lip
of one of the girls which had been cut.
This contradicted the testimony of the
girls. They swore they had been sober
and peaceful.
The trial will be resumed on Monday
morning.

Counsel In Dunsmulr Case Spends
Nearly an Hour ln Eliciting
One Answer.
The troubles of an expert on Cali
fornia law were exemplified yester
day during the hearing of the Duns
muir will contest in the office of the
British Consul. Following the sharp
encounters during many days between
J. J. Dwyer, the probate law expert,
and Sir Charles H. Tupper, came an
involved technical line of questioning
by E. V. Bodwell, who is taking up
the cross-examination in behalf of
Edna Wallace Hopper.
After many questions had been
skillfully n;irried by the witness, who
showed much asperity of temper, a
question was asked by Bodwell which
the witness refused to answer. The
battle raged for three-quarters of an
hour before a definite reply was ob
tained and it took the rest of the day
for ruffled tempers to become smooth
ed. To-day the cross-ques*':oning of
Dwyer will be continued and it is be
lieved that more verbal and technical
pyrotechnics will be seen.

HUTTON READY
TO MAKE FIGHT
Agrees to Answer Subpena
and Will Give Testimony
in Case of Sergeant Ellis
MAY CONTEST REMOVAL
Police Board Throws Down
Gauntlet to Grand Jury
and Will Proceed to Act
The long expected war between the
Grand Jury and the Police Commission
opened last, evening with a prellm
! iaary skirmish on the part of the Com
missioners and a peremptory order
j that, Grand Jury or no Grand Jury,
Sergeant Ellis, accused of connivance i
: with the Chinese gamblers and of j
. warning them on occasion of a certain j
I raid by Commissioner Hutton, must !
I explain what he knows about the "cor- r
I ruption fund."
j The special session of the Police
j Commission was thort. Not over a
half hour was spent in bringing mat
ten to a head, but in that time there .
were introduced several phases of the [
' situation that give promise of exciting
times. President Pohelm of the Police
Board announced that he should not !
consent to allow the Grand Jury to
have everything its own way. The
jury had taken upon itself to specify
the hour and minute that the trial of
Ellis should take place. Sergeant Ellis
had been informed by it that his hear
ing would go over and that he need not
' bother himself about the summons of
; the Police Board, as the commission I
could not proceed until the Grand Jury ;
got ready.
i That the jury had coached the ser- |
geant was evident, for when he was
called he admitted that he was help- j
less, as he had no attorney to represent '
him. There were many present who
felt sympathy for the policeman, who i
has been between the fires of two con
leading factions. However, the ser
geant's excuse would not have saved
him from being subjected to the ques- !
tioning of the Police Board had not the i
stand taken by ex-Police Commissioner
Hutton put a temporary stop to pro- j
: ceedings. Hutton created a mild sen- |
sation by appearing some minutes af
i ter his name had been called by Ser- j
â  geant Donovan. He intimated that he
' would make a contest for his seat on |
1 the Police Commission.
HUTTON ENTERS.
Hutton came into the room as Ellis
was making his excuses for not
1 having a legal champion of his cause,
and with a stately walk crossed the
room and took a seat. For a few mo
ments it looked as if something would
happen, and those who had wits and
pencils sharpened them,
j President Poheim had opened the
; meeting with a request to Sergeant
i Donnvdn to "find whether Mr. Hutton
|is here." Donovan called three times
for the prosecutor, but received no an
| swer.
"Please read the charges against Ser
geant Ellis, Mr. Secretary," said the
; chairman, "and we will proceed with
the trial."
j The complaint of Hutton, alleging
that Ellis had informed the Chinese
gamblers of the proposed raid by the
ex-Commissioner, and that the officer
and the Chinatown squad had permit
ted fan-tan and other gambling games
to be run wide open, was repeated. A
number of Chinese witnesses for the
prosecution and several whites who

were to testify craned their necks and
listened attentively while Ellis stood
facing the beard and heard the oft-read
document.
"Guilty or not guilty?" asked the
chairman.
"Not guilty," answered Ellis.
"I am in a peculiar position," said the
sergeant. "I have no attorney, Mr.
President, and I hardly think that I
ought to go ahead without one."
"You were informed, Sergeant E11i8.â¢ ,
said the president, "that you were to be
tried by this board to-night, and I can
not understand why you are not pre
pared."
WHAT BOWES SAID.
Ellis explained that he had been in
formed by Grand Juryman Bowes that
the trial would not come off last night
and that he was under the impression
that in such matters the Grand Jury
was the governing power. This brought
a snarp. but not ill tempered retort
from Poheim, who replied:
"Bowes had no right to tell you any
such thing. Last Wednesday we in
formed you that we would proceed with
the trial. Mr. Bowes had no right to
dictate what the Police Commissioners
should do."
At this juncture Hutton entered the
room and walked toward the secre
tary's desk, where he paused for a mo
ment Commissioner Drlnkhouse
promptly asked, "Mr. Hutton, are you
ready to proceed with the trial?"
Hutton answered slowly by putting
the query, "What do you mean?"
There was an awkward pause for a
few seconds and then Hutton contin
"l wish to tell you gentlemen that I
think I am still a member of this board
and it is my desire not to participate in
a discussion of the subject that pre
vents my not demanding my seat. I
think I have been illegally removed.
Only in the position of a Police Com
missioner was I acting when I brought
the charges..
"I have my evidence well In hand,
but since I began my investigations the
situation has changed somewhat. I can
only act as an accuser at the request of
the board, otherwise in an official ca
pticit.yÂ«"
President Poheim asked: "Underwhat
conditions would you prosecute?"
Hutton answered: "I don't think that
I ought to undertake to prosecute until
I have determined my position as re
gards this board. I think I Can deter
mine this by Monday night, but I will
not act as prosecutor until I am a mem
ber of the board."
WOULD OBEY BOARD.
Hutton then said that he had always
been a stickler for the obeying of a
Police Board subpena, and that if the
Commissioners insisted on his answer
ing their summons he would do so and
reply to their questions.
Monday evening at 7:30 o'clock was
the hour set for the trial, and in an
nouncing this President Poheim threw
down the gauntlet to the Grand Jury
by giving Sergeant Ellis advice not to
rive atetntion to what the inquisitorial
body had to say. Poheim told Ellis not
to pay any attention to Grand Juryman
Bowes and furthermore Informed him
that he was going to be tried by the
Police Commissioners regardless of the
jury actions. Commissioner Ragan then
moved that the trial be held Monday
evening at 7:30 o'clock, and the meeting
was declared adjourned.
Hutton did not care to go into any
details of his prospective actions in the
case. He said he was willing to answer
the questions put to him by the Com
missioners, and in this way he would
probably bring out the arguments of
corruption in Chinatown, such, as he
had hoped to present in the capacity of
Police Commissioner.
After the session of the commission
was over Grand Juryman Bowes
walked into the Commissioners' rooms,
asked a few questions and disappeared.
He was evidently much piqued at the
stand that the Police. Board had taken.
