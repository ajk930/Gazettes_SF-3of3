said: - ,
'This record-breaking gathering of
San Franciscans and Californians and
of enthusiastic Republicans is a monu
ment to our distinguished visitor, from
whom we expect to hear a | discussion
of the issues of the campaign. Before
he speaks, however, I take pleasure In
naming the chairman to preside at this
meeting, the senior Senator from Cali
fornia, the Hon. George C. Perkins."
Senator Perkins was greeted with
generous applause, to which he re
sponded as follows:
"This splendid audience of represent
ative citizens of the great metropolis of
the Pacific Coast States, proves beyond
the potency of words that the people
realize the Importance of self-govern
ment and are willing and desirous to
pay tribute to the advancement,; pros
perity and honor of our nation. .It
means that in this political : campaign
the wise and beneficent policy, of the
Republican party for eight years will
be as closely adhered to for the next
four years. It means triumphant suc
cess for that party and the election,
by an overwhelming majority, of Presi
dent Roosevelt and the candidate for
Vice President. Senator Fairbanks.
"We are especially favored this even-
Ing in having two of the most dis
tinguished of our countrymen present
to trace out and discuss the political
issues. - I refer to our distinguished
guests this evening. Senator Fairbanks
and .Senator Fulton. I esteem It a
great honor, as it Is a favor, to present
to you the next Vice President of the
United States." Â¦;"..Â¦ .'
As the Vice candidate
rose, the Pavilion rang with cheers and
applause. - The thousands of .flags
waving throughout the Pavilion added
life and color to the scene. But all be
came Quiet when he raised his hand in
gesture at the < beginning of his ad
dress. In parr he said:
"Senator Perkins and Ladies and
Gentlemen: I thank you for this mag
nificent demonstration . of patriotism. I
realize that it Is Â¦ not personal, but is
due especially to . the . fact that I have
the honor of standing for those great

a beggarly 6 per cent of this enormous
trade. It was the opinion of President
McKinley, now held by President
Roosevelt and the Republican party,
that we shculd obtain an increased
share of the inter- Pacific and trans-Pa
cific commerce. We have, during the
last seven years, increased our exports
to countries in the Orient until they
now represent over 10 per cent of the
total imports of those countries and
yet this is not our proper share. Under
prudent and conservative administra
tion it Is destined to "be largeiy in
creased.
TERRITORIAL EXPANSION.
.. "We annexed the Hawaiian Islands
because * of thetr - commercial and stra
tegic Importance;, they were long re
garded as essential in the national de
fense." We have acquired tne Island of
Tutuila, of the Samoan group, which
possesses the most desirable: harbor in
the South Pacific- .A commercial ca
ble has been constructed across the Pa
cific and it is under American control.
The open door in the Orient has been
carefully preserved through our wise
and Just '. diplomatic policy. . Our con
sular service has been used to extend
to the utmost commercial trade
throughout the world.
"Our foothold in the Philippines has
increased our influence and given us
a point of vantage in the Orient." (Ap
plause.)
"AH of these things, which have been
accomplished by Republican adminis
tration, tend to give us a larger par
ticipation in a vast commerce which
has hitherto been largely under the
control of other countries. Our ex
ports to Asia and Oeeanlca in 1S36 were
$42,827,238. Last year they amounted
to $106,770,591. showing an Increase in
seven years of $63,943,333.
"We wish to enlarge this trade in the
interest of the products of the farm
and the factory; In the Interest of
American wage-earners and American
capital.
â¢ "It will b*Â» Interesting to observe the
principal articles of export and their
increase In exportation in the last thir
teen years.- In 1S90 we exported to
China, Hongkong. Japan. Asiatic Rus
sia. Australasia, Hawaii and the Phil
ippine Islands, iron and steel for man
ufacturing of iron and steel amounting
to $2,900,000. Last year the total wtf

"Cotton cloth In 1890 amounted to
$1,500,000. Last year to $14,700,000.
"Breadstuffs" amounted to $3,500-000 in
1890. Last year thÂ« total was J18.9O0.0OO.
"Cotton, unmanufactured, in 1S30.
amounted to only JS5.0OO, while last
year the amount was $7,500,000.
"Provisions increased from $513,000 la
1S90 to $1,800,000 In 1903.
"The articles mentioned are but a
few of those embraced In our annual
exports. The extension of our com
merce Into the Far East ia a matter
which concerns all sections of the coun
try and we should spare no honorable
effort to' expand it to the utmost de
gree. "We have but to adhere to the
policy which we have thus far pursued
and we shall come into a full share of
the commerce there which naturally
belongs to us.
ISTHMIAN* CANAIi.
"The President's course in connection
with the isthmian canal entitles him to
praise. It has been characterized by
an appreciation of our national ne
cessities â¢ and a high conception of
duty. . He has realized that its
construction was demanded In the
interest of our commerce and to
increase our national defense. Every
step taken has been taken advisedly
and well. There has been nothing done
which Is in derogation of our national
honor. The Clayton-Bulwer treaty of
1850 was superseded by the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty, giving the United
States the Independent and exclusive
right to. build and maintain the canal.
The President, like his great predeces
sor did not wish anything done in con
travention of our national duty toward
Â» friendly power.
"As the Clayton-Bulwer treaty stood
in the way, it was necessary to super
sede it by a new convention, under
which the United States should be left
free to take up and carry forward the
work as she should deem best-. The ne
gotiations to supersede the old treaty
were begun by President McKinley and
concluded by President Roosevelt.
President Roosevelt, after the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty was out of the way. ne
gotiated-with Colombia for^the requi
site franchises and privileges for the
construction and maintenance of the
Ten thousand people cheered, ten
thousand flags waved at Mechanics'
Pavilion last night when Senator
Charges "Warren Fairbanks, Republican
candidate for Vice President of the
United States, rose to inaugurate the
campaign on behalf of his party in
California. It was a demonstration of
fealty to the principles and policies of
the dominant party that will live in the
history of the political affairs of the
fctate.
It wÂ»s all red-hot, strenuous enthu
siasm. No hypocrisy lurked behind the
cheere. nor were the people lifted, to
endeavor by the occasion, which was
â¢witnuut parallel in the mexaozyiiOtjLhe
mighty host* that participated." The ap
pearance of Senator Fairbanks on the
platform, accompanied by Senator
George C. Perkins of California and
Senator C. W. Fulton of Oregon, was
the signal for the outbreak of en
thusiasm. The great crowd had been
supplied with flags and, leaping to
their chairs, the people cheered until
their voices mingled in one great roar
and the air was ablaze with the flash
ing Ftripes of the national emblem.
Senator Fairbanks stood silently
watching the unusual scene, and his
face lighted up with comprehension of
its significance. To him it told the
story that California is firm In its loy
alty to the party he is helping to
lead on to another victory, and in the
great crowd he saw unswerving: adhe
rents. But the people had come to
hÂ«=sr the issues of the campaign logi
cally and eloquently discussed, and at
the wave of a hand silence came over
them and they sat down to listen. But
at each men'ion of the name of Roose
velt or McKinley or Perkins or any of
the statesmen that have had a hand
in shaping the policy of the last two
administrations they again broke into
cheers and the flags again waved in
token of allegiance and approval.
ESCORTED BY COM31TTTEE.
Senator Fairbanks and party arrived
at the Oakland mole from the north at
6 o'clock last night. Escorting Senator

the engineer and fireman from the cab.
shook them heartily by the hand. They
both sr^med greatly pleased at Senator
Fairbanks' courtesy. The Senator then

the ferry boat and there, surrounded by
the members of his party, enjoyed the
refrerhing evening air. "for." he said,
"the .hottest siege of the campaign I
have had to-day was coming through
the vjalley. when the sun refused to
limit his ferocity."
But few people on the boat recognized
Senator Fairbanks, and the trip across
the bay wa3 uneventful. Arriving on
this side the party was driven to the
Palace Hotel. Senator Fairbanks first
looked over his mail and then joined
his party at supper. This completed he
enjoyed a Khort rest and then, accom
panied by the escort committee named,
went to the Pavilion.

a magnificent demonstration of approval of the administration that has keptjthe prosperity of the nation at the flood and marked out for it a greater future.
Senator Fairbanks, accustomed by years of experience to read the spirit that actuates such demonstrations, was visibly gratified at the tribute offered by the
cheering thousands. In turn he paid a tribute to the people for their manifest loyalty to the great party of the nation he represents, and promised, on behalf

â Excerpt from the speech of Senator Fairbanks. ..
CALLS ON CALIFORNIA TO GIVE AID TO THE NATION.'
of the Republican party, each dollar of
our currency;' whether, it is silver or
paper, is gold's equivalent. We haven't,
several kinds of. currency varying- in
value, but we have several kinds of
currency identically of the same value.
"What do you think -, would have
been the condition of th'e country to
day, if, in 1896, or In 1900, the Ameri
can people had accepted the monetary
policy of the Democratic party?. No
one can, in imagination, conceive the
disaster that would have followed the
adoption of the Democratic in place of
the Republican policy. 1
"From the beginning of our admin
istration in the Philippines, our task
has been made more difficult because
of the hope held out by the opposi
tion that the islands were to be given
over by the United States, and their
control left to the Filipinos. Those
who have made a study of conditions
know full well that the people are to
tally unfitted to govern themselves,
and that the withdrawal of the Unifed
States at any time since our occupancy
would have resulted in giving them
over to anarchy. For centuries B the
people knew no rule except that of
Spain. They are in all ! stages of, de
velopment, running from a very low
to a high order in the scale of civiliza
tion.
"The opposition in 1900 declared
that imperialism was the dominant is
sue, and held out the hope to the Fili
pinos, many of whom were then with
arms in their hands, resisting the au
thority of the United States, that
Democratic victory meant Philippine
independence. This expectation, en
couraged by the opposition, cost us the
lives of many American soldiers, and
the expenditure of millions of dollars.
The hope was wholly Illusory, and
when the election resulted in the tri
umph of William McKinley, the insur
rectionists speedily surrendered their
arms and took the oath of allegiance
to the United States. Armed opposi
tion to our sovereignty quickly disap
peared. The zone of peace was rap-
Idly enlarged. So fast as possible, our
army was reduced and sent home.
PROSPERITY IN ISLANDS.
"The work of building up civil gov
ernment, of educating and enlisting
the natives in the administration of
their own affairs, under the princi
ples of our republican institutions, is
going forward rapidly. The people
the pursuing the ways of peace and
are enlarging the measure of their
prosperity. A brighter day has dawn
ed for the people of that far off land
than was ever conceived possible un
der Spanish rule. (Applause.) :
"There- has been no time from the
beginning of our administration when
there has been^ any thought of ex
ploiting the Philippines for the ben
efit of the United States. The interest
of the people of the Islands has been
the primary and paramount consider
ation with us. The advantages to the
United States, though wholly subor
dinate and secondary, are neverthe
less real and substantial and they
promise still larger benefits in open
ing the way for our commerce into
the vast markets of the Orient.
"There need be no concern as to our
future relations with the Philippines.
If we shall meet the duties of the
hour upon an exalted, intelligent, hu
mane plane and If we shall continue
to carry Into our administration as
rapidly as the people of the archipela
go can enjoy them the principles of
American institutions no one need
have any fear as to the future of the
islands. The American people can be
trusted to-day to meet in full meas
ure any obligation which rests upon
them with respect to the people in
the Philippines and those Who shall
come after us will be as wise and as
sensitive in the discharge of their na
tional duty as we arc < Those who

SUPPORTS THE NOMINEE.
"While our great party will be vic
torious throughout the length - and
breadth of this Â¦ great land I want to
speak for special effort on the part of
Calif ornians to send to the House of
Representatives as your majority
choice from this city . the Hon. Julius
Kahn. (Cheers.) And to . the voters
of the Fifth, Congressional district, In
which part of Ban. Fsandsco Â¦ is situ
ated, I wish to ask their hearty sup
port of the Republican nominee, Mr.
B. A. Hayes. In fact, I wish. to sug
gest that the best possible thing Cali
fornians could' do would be to send a
solid Republican delegation to Congress
from California. (Applause.)
"In passing I want to touch upon the
record of the Republican party for the
fifty years of. its existence/written
most splendidly in history "for at least
forty-four years of that time. There 1s
no act of the Republican party over
which we ask the mantle of/ charity
thrown. Our past record is a guaran
tee of what the Republican party will
accomplish in the future. Our policies
are not laid as a groundwork for dis
trust and commercial distress. These
policies were good yesterday, they, are
good to-day, and they will be good to
morrow.. â¢ ,
"Let us make sure, then, in select
ing our candidates and our. men. .to
guide the course of our nation. Select
those in whose hands has been in
trusted the work, of the past and who,
therefore, may be trusted to do .their
duty in the future. Let San Francisco
give her best Republican vote to the
State, and California her best to^ the
nation and send to the Presidential
chajr for the next four years Theodore
Roosevelt." (Cheers.) r , ;â¢
ENTHUSIASTIC CHEERING.
At the conclusion of Senator* Fair

that it gave him a rousing three times

cheering ceased and Senator Perkins
requested the quartet to sing as an

do nothing for California until Oregon

VA .great hue and cry was made
about the trusts formed to throttle
competition and increase ,the price of
products to the public. In 1890 during
a Republican administration the Sher
man act > was Â¦ passed to regulate the
trusts. .Soon afterward the Democrats
succeeded the Republicans and Mr.Ol
ney declared the Sherman law of
doubtful validity. When William Mc-
Kinley entered the White. House he re
fused to abide by Qlney's opinion aqd
took steps to prosecute the . violators.
The Spanish war and the trouble in
China distracted his .attention." but
President Roosevelt with his usual en
ergy V- directed the prosecutions be
pushed to a conclusion."
"We stand' for the highest ideals in
the world and must be able to com
mand and to demand the respect of all
peoples of the world. If there were no
differences between the two parites on
the question of governmental policy,
It would still be important that the Re
publican party should be victorious. No
man who has occupied the presidential
chair has brought to his official duties
the high appreciation, the sense of duty
to the people, the unwavering execu
tion of the laws as our fearless leader,
Theodore Roosevelt. (Cheers.) If he
has made enemies they are those who
would have defied the law had he not
compelled them to respect and obey it.
" "Democrats are not waging a war so
much upon the Republican party as
upon Its leader personally. They'know
that' the present policies are not to bs
lightly set \ aside, therefore they have
turned; the management over to those
who have felt themselves to be superior

that in June last, Just simply as a fore
runner of what we are going to do v in
November, we gave the Republican

In his speech Senator Fairbanks
referred to the far-reaching fame of
the section and dwelt upon the ne
cessity of preserving the political con
ditions in order to maintain, the pres
sent prosperous status of business.
When he said that he had last been
hero when President McKinley was a
candidate McKinley's name was loud
ly cheered, and Fairbanks told his
hearers that while they did well' to
applaud that name, they should bear
in mind that they were to have in
Theodore Roosevelt a President who is
inspired by the same lofty purpose as
his predecessor. â¢ f
Senator Fulton recalled the admin
istration of President Cleveland and
warned his audience against doinff
anything calculated to produce a repe
tition of it â a misfortune that might
occur If Judge Parker should be

FAIRBANKS ENTERS STATE.
MONEY -IK CIRCULATION.
"In 1896 we had in circulation about
51,1500,000.000, while we now have about
$2,500,000,000. And under the wise policy
*The service It rendered . In 1896 to
the cause of sound money entitles it
to the everlasting gratitude of the
American people. There never has
been in the history of the republic a
more subtle and violent assault upon
our monetary system than was made
eight years ago. In that supreme cri
sis the Republican party had the as
sistance of a large army of patriotic
Democrats, who put their country's
Interests above all else and aided in
the election of William McKinley to
the Presidency. All honor to them.
We find In their attitude ample assur
ance that In the hour of the country's
gravest peril there are patriots who
are ready and willing: to serve her.
"The Republican party Â¦ pledged its
faith in the gold standard and when
intrusted with power it enacted the
neeessary law, putting our money upon
the gold basis. This was accomplished
against violent . opposition. We were
charged with being subservient to some
goldhoarding influences, and- the direst
perils to our people were predicted by
the opposition if we succeeded. It was
insisted that we adhered to the gold
standard because we wished to make
money scarcer and dearer; because we
wanted to cheat labor. The logic of
events has proven all these things
false. Our experience has shown that
the Republican party had the only
sound and sensible view. Our policy
has Increased the volume of our money
and the credit of our Government has
been Increased so that it is the best of
any in the world.
"The Republican party has stood for
the maintenance Inviolate of the finan
cial credit of the country. It has. al
ways stood against repudiation in all
Its forms, and It has insisted, upon
the maintenance of the best possible
currency. It ha* not been satfefled
with any currency which was less than
the best in the world. (Applause.)
"The opposition insisted upon the
construction of a canal upon the Nicar
agua route. The latter was antagon
ized by the Republican party because
it never could become a sea level ca
nal, while the Panama route could be
constructed at sea level, should the
needs of commerce require.
"The Nicaragua canal would cost
J18JÂ»,000.000; the Panama canal but
J1S4.O00.000. And furthermore, the lat
ter can be operated for 51.350.000 less
per annum than can the longer route.
"The considerations, therefore, of to
pography, of distance, of original cost
and the cost of maintenance and opera
tion were so strongly in favor of the
Panama route that both President Mc-
Kinley and President Roosevelt felt
that It should be selected.
"The interests of all sections of our
common country will be promoted by
the construction of the Panama canal.
Our national defense will be promoted
thereby. Our commerce will be lanrelv
increased as the result of the comple
tion of this great undertaking.
"No section of the count-y will be
more beneficially affected by the great
work than the Pacific Coast. San Fran
cisco will be brought more than nine
thousand miles nearer the harbors of
the Atlantic seaboard, by water, than
Fhe is to-day. This means an increase
to her commerce through the years to
come which defies present estimate.
"The great undertaking is essentially
Â£ Republican enterprise, and its com
pletion will mark a new Republican
contribution to the commerce of the
United States.
FINANCIAL CREDIT.
"Every step taken to advance the
enterprise during the administrations
of President McKinley and President
Roosevelt, has encountered sharp Dem
ocratic criticism. Weeks and months
were occupied by the opposition in
challenging the good faith of those who
were trying to carry forward the work.
But for such opposition the enterprise
would be much farther advanced to
day than it is.
"The President acted quickly, but
he deliberated well upon the subject.
He studied carefully the trend of
events. He was watchful of our na
tional interests. * He had made him
self familiar with our rights and ob
ligations. He knew perfectly what we
should and what we should not do.
When he recognized the independence
of Panama promptly, he only did what
had been done by the government be
fore and by other governments when
peoples had successfully asserted their
Independence. When he gave Instruc
tions to the commander of our vessel
in Panama waters to preserve peace
upon the Isthmus, to prevent Injury to
American citizens and to property, he
acted absolutely within our treaty
rights and to his appreciation of
the gravity of the situation and his
courageous and prompt action, we are
indebted, and the world is also in
debted for the prevention of bloodshed.
By his course he not only averted
bloodshed and disorder, but put an
end to the efforts obviously made by
the Bogota government to hold up the
canal enterprise indefinitely, and he
paved the way for its early construc
tion in the Interest of the commerce of
the world.
"The opposition seeks to condemn
the President for adopting the means
by which we acquired our present
rights and franchises upon the Isthmus,
yet they pledge themselves to carry
forward the work of construction.
They challenge the morality of the
course of the administration, but are

HAPPIEST SIAN IN UNCLE SAM'S
"1 am the happiest man in Uncle.
Sam's navy. I must have sot the piles
from always sitting on the suns. for.
I have to get on them to clean them,
as I am first-class gunner's mate in
the after turret. ~
"I could not do any work when I
had the piles; my shipmates did it for
me. I certainly was In a bad condition;
to-day there is no man ahoard the ship
in better condition than J am. and I
can certainly thank Pyramid Pile Cure
for the world of good it has done me.
I used so many different medicines and"
spent lots of money until I used this
remedy; it la the only one of the whole
lot that did me any good.
"The first box nearly cured me. and
I don't think I ever felt happier In my
life, that I thought I got the real stuff
at last. To make sure of a cure I used
a number of boxes, also . two boxes of
Pyramid Pills and one and one-half
boxes of Pyramid Ointment, and I still
have four boxes of Pyramid Pile Cure
left, that I keep in case I meet anyone
that is a sufferer of piles. I thank
Pyramid Pile Cure a . million times."

The wonderful cures effected by this
remedy are subject for remark among
members of the medical profession
everywhere. A little book describing
the cause's and cure of piles is publish-
ed by the Pyramid Drug Co., Marshall.
Mich., and we advise every sufferer to
write for it. It is a singular fact that
one out of every four suffers from"
this distressing complaint, and another
peculiar feature is that it is no re-:
specter of persona, attacking both those
of high and of low degree, the laborer
and the millionaire, the scrubwoman
and the lady of fashion. We have
pleasure in recommending .*â¢ Pyramid
Pile Cure to all such, aa it possesses
merit, and since It la sold, by all druj-

of my life to atone for the wrongs I have
done. I shall have mere to say later on.
There are many other things I can and will
tell later, but this will do 'now. This, in
brief. Is nsy story and the confession of my
Infamy. I believe, though, that if the people
of St. Lcuis allow this man (a prominent poli

ties and put his men in office the public will
be just as guilty as I am tc-'iay. Such is his
hold on the community. Though It seems

American Federation of Labor, has
filed with the Interstate Commerce
Commission a complaint, alleging dis
crimination on the part of the Trans
continental Passenger Association and
other railroad associations against the
Federation of Labor in the matter of
reduced rates for delegates to the na
tlcnal meeting of that organization to
be held In San' Francisco ' beginning
November 14. ,
The protest alleges that. In response
to inquiries on the subject, the federa
tion was informed by the railroads
that the "regular rate" would be
charged. The federation officials
claim that special rates are allowed
theatrical companies, baseball teams
and fraternal organizations, ajid that
heretofore such rates have been ac
corded to their organization.

ET. LOUIS, Oct. 3. â In a written
confession to-day Charles F. Kelly,
Speaker of the House of Delegate*
during a period of the life of the
boodle combine, relates the story of
thax combine. He declares that a
prominent local politician promised
himself and others implicated that the
next Circuit Attorney would be. "all
right" and promised if they would re
main firm he would secure for them
eithex continuances until the new. Cir
cuit Attorney took office or pardons af
terward. He declares that the politi
cian said the new Circuit Attorney, for
which offlce nominations are to be
made by the Democrats to-day, would
be "his man." Kelly declares he re
fused this offer and he makes this
confession to satisfy the pangs of an
accusing conscience, to obey the re-
Quests of his wife and to do what he
can to make atonement to the public
and prevent other young men from
following the path which he declares
has led him to ruin.
In the course of his confession Kelly
details the story of the city lighting
deal, for which a boodle fund of
$47,500 was divided among the nine
teen members of the combine at Julius
Lehmann's birthday party. He de
clares that the "prominent politician"
gave him the boodle fund, that he
took It to Lehtnann's house and that
he there divided it. Kelly writes:

The convention was called to order
at S:45 o'clock by Chairman J. C. Sims,
who asked for the report of thÂ© com
mittee on order of business, which was
presented by John J. Sweeney, chair
man of the committee. On motion of
Thomas Hickey the report was
adopted. '
Chairman Sydney Van Wyck Jr. of
the committee on contests submitted
the committee findings, which created
considerable stir among the delegates,
as there was severe criticisms in the
document on the methods alleged to
have been adopted in the Forty-third
Assembly District, where political lead
ers, under the management of James
Coffroth, made a vigorous fight for the
Democratic League ticket. Van Wyck
was frequently interrupted by shouts
to "come off" and to "pass the report
tlong, we don't want to- hear it." He
everal times appealed to the chair and
on each occasion was upheld. The
paragraph of the x^port referring to
alleged ballot box stuffing and fraudu
lent voting caused a furor.
"I insist that the chairman of this
committee be heard," shouted Chair
man Sims. "This is part of the busi
ness of this convention and there can
be no motions entertained as long as*
the report is being read." ""*
In the district the contest was made
by, Fred Franzen, Larry Hartnett,
Louis Mehrtens, William J. Hogan,
Joseph P. Hayes, John J. Driscoll,
David B. Torres and George Heggerty
of the organization ticket against the
election of John W. Roach, Thomas
Keenan, Charles Bantel, Patrick Flynn,
P. F. McCarthy and William Bush of
the league ticket, together with Wil
liam Hogan and Joseph P. Hayes.
Hayes and Hogan, therefore, contested
their own election. The polling place
under suspicion was primary election
precinct 103.
Henry Eickhoff contested the election
of Livingston -Jenks, James P.' Quie
ley, D. S. Curran and Thomas Judet.
He held that he should have one whole
vote instead of giving one-fourth of a
vote to each of the four.* ,

adopted by a vote of 93 to 72.

tingle with the sharp criticisms con
tained therein on the conduct of the
present city administration. Many of
the delegates did not .expect such a
severe jab at the Schmrtz regime and
winced notably, as not a few of them
have been more or less Identified with
the Ruef following. The platform,
which was adopted without protest ex
vcept in its recommendations regarjiiner
the appellate court amendment, was as
follows:
We, the representatives and delegates of the
Democratic party of the city and county ot
Kan Francisco. State oÂ£ California, In convent

CONVENTION AT WORK.
As predicted in The Call yesterday
morning, Muraaky, Seawell. White and
Conlan were nominated for the Su
perior bench. Gavin McNab attended
the convention. Â»
In contrast with this engagement,
other proceedings of the* convention
were quite monotonous. The delegates
heartily indorsed Judge Doollng, the
Democratic nominee for the Supreme
Court, but no cheers or words of com
mendation were given for the Demo
cratic nominees for Congress, W. . J.
Wynn and E. J. Livernash. - . â
Smashes in the face and kicks in the
abdomen enlivened the finish of - tho
Democratic municipal convention at
Pioneer Hall last night. Big Jim
Welch, who holds a Job oh the ' fire
tug of the Ha*rbor Commission, spoke
to Supervisor Sam Braunhart, who was
standing on the floor of the convention
near the platform. The latter did not
reply.âwhereupon Welch smashed the
Supervisor on the jaw, the most in
vulnerable section of his anatomy.
The blow staggered Braunhart and
enraged State Senator Joseph" M.
Plunkett. A speedy mlxup resulted.
The Senator landed quickly on Welch's
face, and the latter went to the floor,
where he received considerable pun
ishment about his head and ribs* before
the police could intervene. I
"WASHINGTON, dct. 3.â J. H. Lefftr,
the Haytian Minister to the United
States, said In an interview to-day*:
"Some one In New York Is trying to
mislead the newspapers In giving the
Information contained^ in the Issues of
to-day. It Is said that the three white
men confined in a dungeon In Port au
Prince are the victims of political
schemes and will probably be put to
death unless through publicity the
United States Is induced to take action
In their behalf. The three white mea
are J. de la Myre de Puyboudet. G.
Ohlrlch and R. Tippenhauer. The first
two are Frenchmen and the other Is a
German. ;..;;
"These men confess that they are
only guilty of having received a 'grati
fication' for issuing some Haytian
bonds. De la Myre was a director of
the National Bank of Hayti and the
others were employed at the same bank
when the bonds were lsued. It was the
duty of the bank to Issue the bonds.
The American people will surely call
bribery what the guilty parties call
'gratification,' or commission.
"In a few days the parties will be
brought to trial before a criminal court
and Jury. The trial will be public. Any
one may be present and ascertain
whether the proceedings are fair or
not." \
Special Dt3p*tc!i to ThÂ« OUt
Fifty thousand people massed in
front of the City Hall and adjacent
ways and many cases of- fainting
women were noted. Police ambulances
carried nineteen persons from the
crush to their homes and others were
cared for in the City Hall.
Thirty-five thousand people passed
through the City Hall and viewed the
body between 4:30 and 9:30 to-night.
The four hours allotted for this cere
mony proved inadequate and an ex
tension of an hour was made.
Rev, Dr. Hale, who was the first?
pastor of the Church of the Unity, and
Rev. Rush R. Shippen, the second pas
tor, now of Brockton, Mass., officiated
at the church. Dr. Hale delivered the
eulogy. At the conclusion of the serv
ice the body was conveyed to the City,
Hall, where it will lie in state. To
morrow the remains will be taken to_
Concord for burial.
"WORCESTER, Mass., Oct. 3. â The
city of Worcester to-day bowed be
side the body of her foremost citizen,
George Frisbte Hoar, while the State
of Massachusetts, and in a large meas
ure the nation, sympathized with the
municipality In her grief. .
Rev. Dr. Edward Everett Hale,
chaplain of the United States Senate
and lifelong friend of Senator
conducted prayers at the home Just
before 2 o'clock. Only members of
the immediate household ai>d a few
neighbors attended this serWce. The
body was then placed in the hearse
by the active pallbearers, all the pres
ent or past secretaries of the Senator,
and the honorary pallbearers, Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge, T. Jefferson
Ccolidge, Charles Francis Adams, At

William F. Draper, Judge Francis C.
Lowell of Boston, Colonel George H.
Lyman of Boston, Stephen Salisbury,
Henry A. Marsh, Dr. G. Stanley Hall
and William E. Rice of Worcester.
The active bearers and the family es
corted the remains to the Church of
the Unity.
The militia force of the city,, four
companies of infantry and a battery
of light artillery under arms were sta
tioned in the streets to aid the police
in handling the greatest crowd ever
seen in the city. As the hearse passed,
I every man bared his head and many
sobbed.
The capacity of the church is 600,
and it was necessary to limit 4he at
tendance to representatives of organ
izations to which the Senator belonged
and to one person for each municipal

Mayor for Its only official representa

The crown of woaaahood m motherhood.
But uneasy lies the head that wears the
crown or anticipates this coronation, when
there is a lack of womanly strength to bear
the burdens of maternal dignity anil duty.
The reason -why so many women sinkjuader
the strain cf motherhood is because they
are tnprepared.
'"I unhesitatingly advise expectant moth-
ers to. use Dr. Pierce 's Favorite Prescrip-
tioa, â¢writes Mrs. J.W. G. Stephens, of Mila,
Northumberland Co., Va. The reason for
this advice is that Dr. Pierce '3 Favorite Pre-
scription is the best preparative for the
maternal function. No matter bow healthy
aad strong: a woman may be, she cannot
use- "Favorite Prescription* as a prepara-
tive for maternity without gain of health
and comfort. Â¦ But it is the women who are
not strong: w &o best appreciate the great
benefits received from the use of "Favorite
Prescription.'' - For ose tiring its use makes
the baby's advent practically painless. It
has ia many cases reduced days of suffer-
ing to a few brief hours. It &as changed
the period of, anxiety aad struggle into a
time of ease and comfort.

Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
-SALT LAKE, Oct. 3.â President Jo
seph F. Smith of the Mormon church
has made an address to the Mormons
of Washington County that has caused
a sensation among the Gentiles of the
State. The address was delivered at
the regular conference of the St'.
George Stake. President Smith, An
thony H. Lund, one of his counselors,
and Apostle Hyrum M. Smith, . Presi
dent Smith's Bon, went from Salt' Lake
to attend the conference. In his ad
dress President Smith spoke of the op
position the Mormon church has met
with from. members of other churches.
He compared Utah with Judea, where,
he said, the same general conditions
existed. In counseling the Mormons
as to their temporal affairs, he said:
"The Gentiles are coming among' us to
buy homes and land. We should not
sell to them nor aid them, as they are
the enemies of the kingdom of God. I
have never sought to be a vast land
owr^er, but I have -never sold an inch
of ground to an enemy of God's work."
President Smith offers an explana
tion of his statement by saying he
learned, many of the Mormons were
movfng away and he advised them to
remain and "not to sell out their homes
and lands to their enemies."
St. George is more, than,. one ' hun
dred miles from . the railroad and . the
population of the region' surrounding
It is almost entirely - Mormon. It has
been claimed for some time past that
Mormon leaders were making addresses
in remote portions - of the State, along

The end was expected at any moment,
but to the surprise of the doctors the

nounced that the Postmaster General
had rallied suddenly and exclaimed
"Hello" to those about him. Milk then
was given him to drink. -Dr. Magruder
asked the patient how he was feeling
and he replied "First rate."
! At 2:50 Dr. Magruder said that
Paynels respiration was better" and
more regular than It has been In the
past twenty-four hours and that If the
improvement kept' up, he probably
would last through the night and that
a consultation could'probably be held
In the morning. Drs. Grayson and Ma

been Injected into Payne at midnight,
when the sinking spell began, is now
absorbed. and that the effect is shown
by the improved respiration and pulse.
It was added that this is not an indi
cation of recovery, but that the patient
might last until morning. This fluid is
a fluid that was given to him and to
which at first he failed to respond. It
was after this failure to respond that
it was announced that further admin
istration of stimulants would not avail.

SAN BERNARDINO, Oct. 3.âAm
brose Hunt and wife, one of the oldest
pioneer couples of this section, had a
miraculous escape from death at a
Southern Pacific Â¦ Railroad crossing
near this city yesterday afternoon, the
horse they were driving to a surrey
being torn from the vehicle by a pass
ing train. The old couple have been
living near the crossing for years and
knew its danger, the view of the track
being obstructed by a high bank and
trees, but they thought they were.-safe,
when a train came rushing down "the
grade at great speed.
The vehicle and its occupants were
enevloped in a cloud of dust, Mr. and
Airs. Hunt were bewildered by the roar
and the suddenness of the onslaught,
and when the dust cleared away he
saw that the jolt they had felt had
been caused when the train \ yanked
the horse and shafts out of the surrey,
leaving the occupants sitting dum
founded in a horseless carriage, in the
middle of the road.
The mangled remains of the horse
and parts of the harness and shafts
were found some distance down the
track, where they had been hurled by
,ihe rushing train, but the only injury
received by either of the old couple,
besides the nervous shock, Was a
bruised wrist by Hunt, his arm being
struck, he believes, by a projection
from one of the cars.
American Deserts Orient Because Cen

Among the 150 cabin passengers of

formerly a surgeon in the United
States Engineers, but for the last two
years has been visiting the hospitals of
Japan and making a study of the or
ganization of the medical and surgical
departments of the Japanese armies in
the field. While in Japan he was giv
en every opportunity to inspect the
hospitals, where 25,000 wounded Jap
anese and Russian soldiers are being
nursed back to health, by the most
modern , methods,"' of me,dical science,
hut he. was forbidden, to go to the
front, or to leave Japan for Asia, One
day he slipped away without permis
sion and saw a little actual warfare in
Newchwang and other ' places Â«where
the opposing armies slaughtered each
other. -Major Seaman said:
In their naval and military, medical.', tur
gleal and sanitary organization, the JapanÂ«i>e
astonish the world. They have learned what
we have not succeeded In doing â to tiffin Â»n"i
defeat disease, which you know kills far
mure eoldlem than the bullet. They educate"
their doctors, not In America and Europe, but
In their own^colleifes, and Japanese bacteri
ologists schooled In Japan have discovered the
Kerm of dysentery, diphtheria, plague a.-.d
fever. Before the war began they had made
microscopical and chemical examinations of
every stream and water hole in Manchuria,
and no Japanese force is ever quartered where
the water did not come up to the highest
standard of purity. They can give, the world
pointers in many things and the world would
do well to eo over to Japan and learn a few
things. â¢
Major Seaman made five attempts to
.get into Port Arthur and after being
wrecked on the coast gave it up and
came back to Japan, where the Japan
ese officials were not over much
pleased because of his unceremonious
going away. He is due to attend the
Military and Naval Medical Conven

NEW CHIEF IX SIGHT.
Kuropatkfn May B* Relieved by
Grand Duke Nicholas.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. S. â Em
peror Nicholas returned to SU Peters
burg to-day from the south. It Is re
ported on very high authority that
the appointment of a commander in
chief will be announced within forty
eight hdurs. While General Kuropat
kin"* friends still insist that he will be
appointed members of the Emperor's
entourage express no doubt that
Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholaievitch
will be chosen.
The official advices from the front
to-day report that all is quiet along
the whole line of opposing armies. A
slight Jaoanese movement has bsen
observed at Fengtiapu. about sixteen
mike southeast of Mukden, but there
has been no collision. The War Of
fice apparently does not anticipate
any fighting on a large scale in the
immediate future.
The principal cause of alarm at the
War Office is occasioned by the lack
of definite information regarding the
exact whereabouts of Field Marshal
Oyama's right. The Russian scouts
have lost touch with General Kuroki'F
main army, which may give increasing
importance to the flanking west under
General Oku. which hitherto has been
regarded as a feint for the real turn
ing movement to strike at General
Kuropatkin's line of communication
from the east. It also may contain the
potentialities of a big surprise.
Ten days apo Kuropatkin and the
War Office were convinced that the
Japanese were concentrating at Slans
chan and that an immediate advance
was Imminent in force. Accordingly
the Russians fell back from the passes
of the Da Mountain range without of
fering resistance. But after several
days they suddenly- discovered that
the Japanese were .not pressing for
n-ard and thereupon the , Russian
srout? pushed out to ascertain the
cause. They penetrated as far as
Sianschan and Slaodyr, bringing back
in* startling intelligence that not
mor<< than- a brigade of Japanese
troops *vas there. This forthwith
was followed up by an important cav
alry movement and the reoccupation
of the Da range passeR, but Kuroki's
main body was not located.

toast "Our Quest," Balfour said that
as this was his flrst speech of the au
tumn campaign he desired to be ex
plicit'on one or two essential points.'
In the flrst place,- he said. _t he leader of
the ' Irish party had given wide cur
rency In America to the view that in
the next Parliament the Irish members
'would hold the balance of power. So
far as the Unionists were concerned;
no bargaining would occur. The Union
ists were not for sale. â- , . '
Regarding the fiscal policy, Balfour
said he had nothing to alter in what
is known as the Sheffield policy. He
saW, he was no protectionist; he was
one of those' who thought protection
was not the best policy under existing
circumstances. It was not a policy
that he recommended directly or indi
rectly, either to his colleagues or to the
country, and he did not think he/ could
remain the leader of his party if pro
ection were adopted.
Whether; Mr. Chamberlain's estimate
of colonial opinion was right "or wrong,
Balfour entirely agreed with Chamber
lain that a point had been reached
where the "only way out was to have a
free conference with the self-govern
ing colonies and India. . > :
BOSTON, Oct. 3.â Secretary 6l State
John Hay, -representing the. United
States of America, snoke the yvord of
welcome this afternoon to the dele
gates to the International Peace Con
gress, who have assembled 'here for the
thirteenth annual convention.
: The meeting was held in Tremont
Temple. Edwin D. Mead, chairman of
the committee on organization of tho
Peace Congress, after calling the meet
ine to order, spoke briefly. Mayor Col
11ns "said that no word of his "was nec
essary to 'welcome peacÂ§ delegates .to
Boston, for Boston was the home of
peace. ' He said if he were to para
phrase .a Bible text to suit- the occa
sion it would be this: "Blessed are the
peacemakers, for they, shall see God;
damned be the warmakers, for they
shall see the devil." -
Right Rev. John Percival, Bishop of
Hereford, said that the European na
tions looked to the United States to
lead in the movement for -peace; that
the presence of Secretary of State Hay
in . itself gave a new character to the
gathering. "Our hope for peace," the
speaker said, "is fixed upon the policy
of the United States in the years to
come." Mr.. Lund of the Norwegian
Parliament presented the greetings of
his country. Secretary Hay spoke as
follows:
I esteem It a great honor and privilege to
be allowed to extend to you the welcome of
the Government and the people of the United
States of America on this memorable â¢ and
auspicious occasion. No time could be mor;
fitting: for this gathering of a parliament of
peace than to-day, whei: at the other end of
the world the thunder of a destructive and san
guinary war is deafening the nations, while
here we are preparing to settle the question of
a vast transfer of power by an appeal to
reason and orderly procedure, under the sanc
tion of a law implicitly accepted by eighty
millions of people. No place could be more
suitable than this high-hearted city, which
has been for nearly 300 years the birthplace
and the home of every idea of progress and
enlightenment which has germinated In the
Western world. To bid you welcome to the
home of Vane, of Wlnthrop and of Adams, of
Channinir and Emerson, is to give you 'the
freedom of no mean city, to make you par
takers of a spiritual Inheritance without which,
with all our opulence, we should be poor
Indeed.
It is true -that this great commonwealth
has sought, with the sword, peace under liberty.
We confess that many wars have left their
traces in . the pages of Its history and Its
literature: art has adorned the public plaees
of this stately town with the statues of Its
heroic sons. But the dominant note of its
highest culture, its most persistent spirit, has
been that righteousness which exalteth a na
tion, that obedience to the Inner light which
leads along the paths of peace.
GREATEST MEN FOR PEACE.
. And the policy of the nation at large, which
owes so much of its civic spirit to the found
ers of New England, has been In the main'
a policy of peace. During the hundred and
twenty years of our Independent existence we
have had but three wars with the outside
world, though we .have had a most grievous
and dolorous struggle with our own people.
We baye had, I think, a greater relative im
munity from war than any of our neighbors.
All our greatest men have been earnest ad
vocates of peaoe. The very men who founded
our liberties with the mailed hand detested
and abhorred war as the most futile ar.d fe
rocious of human follies. Franklin and Jeffer
son repeatedly denounced Itâ the one with all
the energy of his rhetoric, the other with the
lambent flre of his wit. - â¢
But not our philosophers alone â our fight
ins men have seen at close quarters how
hideous Is the face of war. Washington said,
"My first wish Is to see this plague to man
kind banished from the earth"; and again he
said, "We have experienced enough of Us
evils in this country to know that it should
not be wantonly or unnecessarily entered
upon." There Is no discordant note In the
utterances of our most eminent soldiers on
this subject. The most famous utterance of
General Grant â the one which will linger long
est In the memories of men â was the prayer
of his war-weary heart, "Let us have peace."
Sherman reached the acme of his marvelous
gift of epigram when he said "War is hell."
And Abraham Lincoln, after the four terrible
years In which he had directed our vast armies
and navies, uttered on the threshold of eter- ,
nlty the fervent and touching aspiration that
"the/ mighty scourge of war might speedily
pass away." \
â¢WORK *OP ROOSEVELT.
There has been continuity in the sentiments
of our Presidents on this subject up to this
Â¦lay. McKlnley deplored } with every pulse of
his honest and kindly heart the advent of
the war' which he had hoped might not come
In his day, and gladly hailed the earliest mo
ment for making peaoe; and President Roose
velt has the same Ureters energy In the work
of concord that he displayed when â¢ he sought
peace and Insured It on thÂ« field of battle.
No Presidents in our history have been so
faithful and so efficient as the last two In the
cause of arbitration and of every peaceful
nettlemÂ«nt of differences. I mention them to
gether because their work has been harmo
nious and consistent. We hailed with Joy the
generous initiative of the Russian Emperor and
sent to the. conference at The Hague the best
men we Â¦ had in our civic and military llf Â«.
When The Hague court lay apparently wrecked
at the beginning of Its voyage, threatened with
death before It had fairly - begun to live, It
was the American Government, which gave it
the breath of life by inviting: 'the republic of
Mexico to share our appeal to Its jurisdic
tion; and the second case brought before It
was at the Instance of Mr. Roosevelt, who de
clined In Its favor the high honor of arbitrat
ing an affair of world-wide importance.
I bee you to believe it - is not by way of
boasting that I recall these Incidents to your
minds; It is rather as a profession of faith
In a cause which thÂ« present administration
has deeply at heart that I. ask you to remem
ber. In the deliberations upon which you are
entering, the | course to which the American
Government Is pledged and which it has stead
ily pursued for the last seven years. It is
true that in those years we have had a hun
dred days of war â but they put an end forever
to bloodshed which had lasted a generation.
We landed a few platoons of marines on the
Isthmus last year; but that act closed with
out a shot a sanguinary succession of trivial
wars. We marched a little army to Peking;
but it was to save not only the beleaguered le
gations, but a great imperiled civilization. By
mingled gentleness and energy, to which moat
of the world beyond our border* has done Jus
tice, we have given to the Philippines, if not
peace, at least a nearer approach to it than
they have had within the memory of men.
. If our example is worth - anything . to the
world, we have given It In the vital matter of
dlnarmarrKmt. We have brought away from
the Far East 55,000 soldiers whose work was
donÂ«. and have Â«ent them back to the fields
of peaceful activity. We nave reduced our
army to its minimum of 60,000 men; In fact,
we may Â«ay we have no army, but In place
of one a nucleus for drill and discipline. We
.have three-fourths of one soldier for every thou
sand of the j population â a proportion Â¦ which If
adopted by the other powers would at once
eliminate wars and rumors of wars from the
dally thoughts of the chanceries of the world.'
PREVALENCE OP WAR SPIRIT.
But fixed as our tradition is, clear as Is our
purpose In the direction of peace, no country
is permanently immune to war so long as the
desire : and I the practice I of peace are not uni
versal. .If we quote Washington as an advo
cate of 'peace. It Is but fair also to quote him
where he says: : "To be prepared for war Is
one of the most effectual means of preserving
peace." And at another time be said: "To
an active external ' commerce the protection of
a naval force . Is indispensable.- To secure re
spect-to a*' neutral flag requires a naval force
organized and ready to vtndlcate It from Insult
or . aggression." To acknowledge the existence
of 'an evil is not to support or approve it; but
the . facts â¢ must be - faced. Human history Is
one .lone . desolate story . of bloodshed. - Ail - the
arts Â¦ unite in . the apparent . conspiracy - to , give
precedence to the â¢ glory of arms. Demos
thenes and Pericles adjured the Athenians by
tbe memory., of their > battles. Horace boasted
that he 'Â« had ; been a . soldier,- non : sine - gloria.
Even-: Milton, In that sublime sonnet where
ho said "Peace hath her victories no less than
those of war," also : mentioned among godly
trophies of Cromwell "Darwent'n stream \ with
blood < of â¢ Scots ; imbued." '.- In almost every - ser
mon land -hymn we hear in our churches,' the
imagery., of war i and , battle Is . used.' . wÂ« , arc
charged to fight : . the good fight of ; . faith ; : we
are Â» to sail through > bloody '. seas - to win 'I the
priÂ«Â«.-tThe Christian soldier Is constantly,mar
shaled . . to Â¦ war. % , Not t only . In ,' our < habits and
customs, but In, our dally sjx^ch and In our
Inmost thoughts* we are beset Â¦ by the * obsession
of, conflict ' and mutual i destruction." Â¦: It - is Â¦ like
the la* of sin In the members to wh<ch the
greatest of the Apostles refers: "Who shall
deliver "ub from the body of .this death T'
I am speaking to jthos* who wcognl** the
lamentable state of things and who yet do
not accept it, or submit to it. and who hop?
that through. the shadow of this night we shall
sweep Into a younger day.> How is this great
deliverance to be accomplished?
RELIGION FURNISHES REMEDY.
We have all recently read that wonderful
sermon on war by Count Tolstoi, in which a
spirit of marvtloua lucidity and fire, abso
lutely detached from geographical or political
conditions, speaks the Word as it has been
given him to speak- It; and as- no other living
man could : have done. . As you read, with an
aching heart, his terrible arraignment of war.
fe-ling that as a man you are partly respon
sible -for all human atrocities, you wait with
impatience for the remedy he ahall propose.
and you find it isâ religion. Yes, that is the
remedy. If. all would do right, nobody would
dp wrongâ nothing is plainer. It is a counsel
of perfection, satisfactory to prophets and
saints, to bo reached In Gods good time. But
you are here to consult together to see whether
the Kenerstion now alive -may not do some
thing .to hasten the coming of the acceptable
day. the appearance on earth of the beatific
vision. If we can not at once make peaoe and
good, will the universal rule and practice of
nations, what can we do to approximate this
condition? What measures can we now take
which may lead us at least a little distance
toward the wished-for goal?
I have not come to advise your 1 have no
such ambitious pretensions. I do not even
aspire to take part in your deliberation. But I
arn authorised to assure you that the American
Government extends to you a cordial and
sympathetic welcome.- and shares to thÂ» ut
most the spirit and purpose In which you
have met. The President, no long as he
remains In powtr. has no thought of depart
ing from The traditions bequeathed us by the
great soldiers and statesmen of our early
history, which have been strictly followed
during the la*t seven years. We shall con
tinue to advocate and to carry f Into effect.
as far as practicable, the principle of the
arbitration of. such questions as may not be
settled through diplomatic negotiations. We
have already done much In this direction;
we shall hope to do much more. The Presi
dent Is now considering the negotiation of
treaties of arbitration with such ot the Eu
ropean powers as desire them, and hopes to
lay them tefore the Senate next winter. And
finally the President has, only a few days
ago, promised. In response to the request of
the Interparliamentary Union, to Invite the
rations to a second conference at The Hague
to continue the beneficent work of the con
ference of 1800. " Â«,rÂ»\v
As if heaven had decided to give a sign
of deepest significance to the hour of your
meeting, it coincides with the commitment to
eternal p*acÂ« of all that was mortal of our
dear and honored co-laborer In this sacred
cause. George Frisbie Hoar had many titles
to glory and .honor. Not the least of them
was the firm and constant courage with which
through all his Illustrious life he pleaded for
humanity fend universal good will. "
STEPS TO BE UNDERTAKEN.
Unhappily we cannot foresee In the Imme
diate future the occasion of wars upon the
earth. IVe ought therefore to labor con
stantly for the mitigation of the horrors of
war. especially to do what we can to lessen
/he sufferinr* of those who have no part in
the strus-rfe. Thla has been one of the most
warmly cherished wishes of the last two ad
ministrations. I make no apolcgy for reading
you a paragraph from the message which
President Roosevelt Â«ent to Congress last De
cember:
-There seems good ground for the belief
that there has been a real growth among
the civilized nations of a sentiment which will
permit a. gradual substitution of other meth
ods than the method of war In the settlement
of disputes. It Is not Dretended that as yÂ«t
we are near a position In which It will be
possible wholly to prevent war, or that a
just regard for. national Interest and honor
will in all cases permit of the â¢ aettlement of
international disputes by arbitration; but by
a mixture of prudence and firmness with wis
dom -we think It U pcsslble to do away with
much of the provocation and excuse for war,
and at least In many cases to substitute some
sother and more rational method for the set
tlement of disputes. The Hague Court offers
so good an examole of- what can be done In
the direction of such settlement that It should
be encouraged In every way.
"Further ste;ia- should be taken. In Presi
dent McKinley's annual message of Decem
ber 5, I8Â»s. he made the following recom
mendation: â¢ â¢
"'The experiences of the last year bring
forcibly home to us a sense of the burdens
and the waste of war. We desire, in common
with most civilised nations, to reduce to the
lowest possible point the damage ' sustained in
time of war by peaceable trade and com
merce.- It l.i true we may suffer In such
cases less than other communities, but ajj
nations are damaged more or less by the state
o( uneasiness and apprehension Into which an
outbreak of hostilities throws the entire com
mercial world. It should be our object, there
fore, to minimize, so far as practicable, this
inevitable loss and disturbance. This pur
pose can probably best be accomplished by an
international agreement to remrd all private
property at sea as exempt from capture or
detraction by the forces of belligerent powers.
The United States Government has for many
years advocated this humane and. beneficent
principle, and Is now In a position to recom
mend It to other powers without the Impu
tation of selfish motives. I therefore suggest
for your consideration that the Executive be
authorized to correspond with the governments
of the principal maritime powers with a view
of Incorporating into the permanent law of
civilized nations the principle of the exemp
tion of all private property at^Â«ea. not contra
band of war. . from capture or destruction by
belligerent powers.' "
AWAITING END OP STRIFE.
The President urged this beneficent scheme
with an earnestness which gained the willing
attention of Congress, already predisposed to It
in spirit, and on tbe 28th of April of this year
he was able to approve a Joint resolution of
both Houses recommending that the "Presi
dent endeavor to bring about an understanding
among the principal maritime powers with a
view of Incorporating Into the permanent law
of civilised' nations the principle of the ex
emption of all private property at sea. not
contraband of war. from capture or destruc
tion by belligerents."
It has not been thought advisable by the
Prenident during the past summer to call the
attention of the powers to a project which
would necessarily be regarded by two of them,
and poÂ»eibly by others, with reference to Us
bearing upon the deplorable conflict now ras
ing in the Far East. But as we earnestly
pray that the return of peace may not be
long delayed between- the two nations, to both
of which we are bound by bo many historic
ties, we may confidently look forward at no
distant day Â¦ to inTltlng the attention of the
nations to this matter and we hope we may
have the powerful Influence - of this great or
ganization In gaining: their adherence.
The time allotted to me Is at an end. I can
only bid you grodspeed In your work. The
task you have set yourselves, the purpose to
which you are devoted> have own the praise
of earth and the blessing of heaven since the
morning , ot time. The noblest of all the
beatitudes I* the consecration promised the
peacemakers. Even If In our time we may
not win the wreath of olive; even tf we may
not hear the tolden clamor of the trumpets
celebrating the reign of universal and en
during peace, it is something to have desired
It, to have worked for it In the measure of
our forces. And If you now reap no visible
guerdon of your labors the peace of God that
p&sses understanding will be your all-suffi
cient reward. Â»-":â¢;"
Does Not Believe He Could
Remain Leader of Party
If Policy Were Adopted
LONDON, Oct. 4.â The Daily Tele
graph's Nagasaki correspondent. ca~
bling under date of September 25, says:
"Terrible artillery conflicts are add
ing to the horror* of the situation at
Port Arthur. On September 22 and 23
the Russians made portieÂ« against posi
tions held by the Kanakawa Regiment,
and desperate fighting ensued. The
Japanese force -was practically annihi
lated, only one non-commissioned offi
cer and eleven men remaining alive out
of the 4900 vrho went into the engage
ment.
"The Japanese tunnel Into Port Ar
thur was completed on September 24,
and was immediately used. The result
is unknown."
CHBFU, Oct. 3, 8:60 p. m.âA pri
vate letter received to-dav,.frorn Port
Arthur, dated September 23, gives
further details 'of the fighting from
September 19 to September 22. The at-,
tack began with a heavy bombardment
directed against nearly all the Russian
outposts and many of the main forts.
The shelling of the redoubts protect
ing the water supply of Port Arthur
was tremendous. Nightfall September
19 found the water works redoubtSjrt
duced to mere heaps of debris. . *The
garrisons of the redoubts thereupon
retreated safely to the main fortifica
tions under the cover of darkness.
At 4 o'clock the same afternoon the
Japanese assault on "High Hill" began.
The Japanese plan of attack never
varied. First a bombardment and then
an assault and, when repulsed, a bom
bardment again and then another as
sault. The desperate determination of
the Japanese to capture this position
amounted to fanaticism, 'their efforts
never ceasing during four days. One
battalion of Japanese, having retreated
into a valley, were exposed to the Rus
sian shrapnel flre and were almost an
nihilated. .
Eventually the Japanese succeeded in
placing one field gun and two machine
guns in position behind hastily made
barriers. Their tenure of the position,
owing to the flre of the inner forts,
was very insecure, and when Lieuten
ant Poggorsky and the volunteers
charged the tide turned agalrist! them.
One battalion, composed or the rem
nants of two companies, was annihi
lated in trenches which they refused to
desert. Another detachment was driven
into the Russian entanglements, where
Captain Sychaff's force was waiting,
and completed its rout Two other at
tempts made by the Japanese to retake
the positions failed.

Stoessel Issues Proclamation After i
Defeat of Japanese.
: CHEFU, Oct. 3. â An official re
port from General Stoeasel, dated
September 2 3, reached Chef u to-day
confirming a previous report of the re
pulse of the Japanese attack at Port
Arthur, Which began- September 19
and ended September 22. .The flghtlnjf
was of an extremely severe character.
The Japanese having retired, Gen
erall Stoessel issued the following
proclamation: "Glory! Thanks to
God! Glory to our heroic garrison!
Glory to Illman. 8ychaff and Poggor
sky! â heroes all. Thanks to our
valiant volunteers, who routed the
enemy from the trenches, destroying
them. God has permitted us to re
pulse the enemy. Praise to God."
The volunteers referred to by Gen
eral Stoessel were made up of regulars
called upon to take a high hill which
had been captured by the Japanese.
The high hill mentioned. was a very
important position to the Russians.
The Japanese attacked repeatedly, day
and night, finally occupying the posi
tion on the night of September 22,
after suffering very severe losses. The
attempt to retake the hill being ex
tremely hazardous, General Stoessel
refused to issue the order, but called
for volunteers. Everybody called
upon responded, whereupon a requi
site number of men were selected,
Lieutenant Poggorsky ajid Captain
Sychaft* leading them. Soldiers and
officers alike carried grenades'(explo
sive shells, weighing from two to six
pound*, which are thrown by hand),
and with these they attacked the
Japanese temporary fortifications and
drove the latter from all of their po
sitions. Several mines were exploded
during the general battle, causing se
vere losses. The Russians calculate
that the total Japanese losses for the
four days' fighting reach 20,000 men.

This is a very pood picture of Mrs.
Mary Rivest. who lives at 522 Forty-
fourth street, Oakland. Mrs. Rivest suf-
fered many years with rheumatism. Fi-
nally tbe left knee became stlffene.l.
swollen and painful, and at last the left
leg became paralyzed. The homo physi-
cian feared ganjrrene at the knee and ad-
vised amputation of the leg. Mrs. Ri-
vest objected to amputation and on ad-
vice from a friend she had her relatives
take her to the Electro-Chemic Institute.
118 Grant avenue. San Francisco. The
Electro-Chemlo treatment cured Mrs.
Rivest quickly. There was no cutting.
There was no pain. In a short time she
threw away her crutches. Her left leg
is now as good as the other and Electro-
chemistry did the work when all other
treatments had failed. Should any one
interested doubt the whole truth of this
most wonderful cure they should go and
see the happy, cured patient. She would
be only too glad to vouch for its truth.
The Electro-Chemic cures of Cancer. Tu-
mors, Consumption. Catarrh, Asthma.
Bronchitis. Deafness. Ringing Ears.
Rheumatism. Paralysis. Locomotor
Ataxla. Neuralgia. Dyspepsia. Liver
Trouble. Kidney and Bladder Troubles.
Piles.- Fistula, Constipation. Headache.
Dizziness. Insomnia. Epilepsy. Stricture,
Prostatitis. Blood Poison. Femaln Irreg-
ularities and Misplacements, etc.. etc..
are Just as wonderful as the cure of Mrs.
Rivest. and upon application tho testi-
monials of hundreds of cured patients
living right here in San Francisco will
be cheerfully given. These wonderful
cures are quick, permanent and inexpen-
sive, and, no matter how many other
treatments have failed. Electro-Chemls-
try would in all probability prove cura-
tive. The Electro-Chemle X-Ray exami-
nation is the most reliable examination
that any sufferer can have. Such an ex-
amination will quickly show whether a
case is curable or not, and this examina-
tion is now absolutely free to any suf-
ferer applying at the Institute- for it.
Don't mistake the place. The success
of the Electro-Chemic practice has
caused other physicians to try t0 lmitato
it. The Electro-Chemic Institute occupies
nearly the whole flrst floor of the large
building. 118 Grant avenue, corner of
Post street The office hours are from 9
to 5 and 7 to 8 dally and from 10 to 1 on
Sundays. Consultation, examination and
advice are free to all. and patients living
at a distance are furnished a homÂ© treat-
ment that is most successful and are
loaned, free of charge until cured, a
complete Electro-Chemic apparatus.
From a wide experience, the physicians
of the Electro-Chemic Institute have
learned that the very best advertising
comes from patients who have been
quickly, thoroughly and cheaply cured,
and while Mrs. Rivest only paid a few
dollars for her wonderful cure, she has
been the means of sending many other
sufferers to the Institute for treatment.

essary to detour traffic by way of the
Southern Pacific, and from advices re

the repair work, which Is being done
as rapidly as possible. While the dam
age is nbt as heavy as that experienced
by the line in Arizona, it is occasioning
fully as much delay and will cost the
company many thousands of dollars.
This city has been left without Pull

to-night's overland to go out . with
tourist sleeping-cars, as substitutes.

the greatest of these was McKinley.
He lived to serve his country. Years
will come and go. but the influence- of
his name will never fade. It is coupled
with that of Lincoln and "Washington."
At the conclusion of his remarks
Senator Fairbanks begged to be ex
cused and with a warm expression of
his regrets that the time limit pre
vented him from a further enjoyment
of the Society of Ohio, he left the ban
quet hall, the quests all standing- as
he departed. The presentation of the
magnificent American flag that' is to
float en the battleship Ohio was a
handsome ceremony. The emblem was
raised aloft in front of the balcony
and the entire company rose and sang
the "Star Spangled Banner."
Captain Logan, in behalf of the ship,
accepted it in fitting terms. His re
marks were frequently punctuated with
applause.
He also received the silver loving
cup presented to the Ohio by M.iss
Helen Dreshler of Columbus, Ohio, and
read a copy of a letter he had written
to her on behalf of the ship and the
State in accepting the beautiful gift.
He closed his remarks by inviting the
members of the Ohio Society to visit
his vessel, on .the. 15th lnst. as the
guests of himself and the officers in
command.
CONQUESTS FOR FRIENDSHIP.
The remarks of Hon. D. M. Delmas
were listened to with profound atten-,
tlon. The purport of his speech was
to the effect that the strength of Amer
ica-laid upon the influence in her
sense of justice, an dthat her con
quests should be made by friendship.
The banquet came to a close by all

Ohio Society Gives Banquet at St. Francis in
tionor of New Acquisition to the Navy. .
The banquet of the Ohio Society of
California last night at the St. Francis
Hotel was a brilliant success. , The oc
casion was to mark the commissioning
of the battleship Ohio. The presence of
Senator Fairbanks added to the In
terest of the occasion, and this, coupled
with the presentation of a stand' of
colors and a loving cup to the battle
ship Ohio, made the occasion a mem
orable one.
The presence of a large number of
wives and lady friends of the members
of the society also added to the gen
eral joyousness of the occasion. The
women were all beautifully arrayed in
handsome evening gowns. The decora
tions were simple, but of artistic ar
rangement- Over 200 participated in
the entertainment. Music, both vocal
and Instrumental, were leading feat
ures.
Hon. W. H. Jordan was toastmaster.
Following was the programme:
Address and presentation of colors, toast
master; response. Captain C. L. Logan, U. S.
N. ; presentation of loving cup, Blshcp M. C.
Harris: response. Captain C. L. Lciran. U. S.
N.; "Our True Greatness." Hoa. D. M. Del
rnas: "The Contributions of Ohio to the Politi
cal Ideas of the Nineteenth Century." Profes
sor Henry Vorse Stephens; prexentatlcns to
battJeship Ohio: staDd of colors, by Ohio So
ciety of California: loving- cup. by Miss Heleo,
Dreahler of Oclumbus. Ohio.
This was carried out to a most suc
cessful issue. Naturally the arrival of
Senator Fairbanks created a great dis
play of enthusiasm. The entire com
pany arose, cheered and waved hand
kerchiefs as the Republican candidate
for Vice President of the United States
entered the banquet hall, during which
the orchestra played "Hail to the
Chief." When the applause had sub
sided, Richard J. Jose, the well known
Finger, rendered three songs In his In
imitable style. They were: "Time and
Tide," "Belle Brandon" and "With All
Her Faults."
EULOGIZES McKIXLEY.
Senator Fairbanks said in part:
"I feel at home among you here
to-night. The same goodfellowship
that exists in Ohio exists in this grand
golden State of yours. I say 'yours'
because although the majority of you
here to-night were born -in Ohio, you
have become sons and daughters of
this State by adoption.
'One sreat thing that distinguishes
Ohio is the hich character of her citi
zens. We are proud of the great bat
tleship that is named for our State,
but our strength, is not in the navy or
the army; it is in the hearts of the
American people. (Great, applause.)
Three names of great men arise be
fore one who comes -from the Buckeye
State. They are. Sherman, Grant and
McKinley. (Great cheering.) One of
IW. H. JORDAN. WHO PRESIDED AT THE BANQUET GIVEN LAST NIGHT IN THE ST. FRANCIS HOTEL BT THE OHIO
SOCIETY OF CALIFORNIA ON THE OCCASION OF COMMISSIONING THE BATTLESHIP NAMED IN HONOR OF THE
BUCKEYE STATEL J ij
Â¦ The Election Commissioner* are now
1 on the rack in connection with' the
frauds at the primary election. The
five members of the board, A. W.
yoorsanger, E. C. Lefflngwell, . J. A.
Devoto, Thomas Maguire and R. W.
Roberts, were before the Grand Jury
I last evening, and It looked for a_while
j as if they would be indicted forthwith
j for failure to observe the law as to the
j appointment of election officers. After
I deliberation the jurors decided to make
further investigation, and when they
adjourned the statement was given out
that definite action may be taken next
Thursday afternoon, when another
meeting will be held.
Each of the Commissioners, when
called before the jury last evening 1 ,
was asked the following questions:
"Are you aware of the requirement
of the law that election officers must
be taxpayers?" "Are you aware that an
election officer 'must have been a resl
j dent of the precinct in which he serves
for at least thirty days?"
The answers in each case were in
the affirmative, and when explanation
was attempted that in the opinion of
j the Commissioners the statute was un
constitutional In that it required a
property qualification for a person to
i hold public office. Chairman LJlienfeld
j promptly called a halt and excused the
I witness.
The Commissioners were willing to
admit that they had not obeyed the
statute, and this fact appeared to be
sufficient for the Grand Jury. But
when the matter was thrashed out lat
er by the Jurors the basis for accusa
tion did not appear so clear to them
as when the testimony was bein^
taken.
The night before the primaries a
number of changes In boards of flec
tion officers were made in the Regis
trar's office. In *the Eightieth or
"Almshouse" precinct only one officer
served of those originally appointed.
The five substitutes were appointed at
the eleventh hour and were not resi
dents of the precinct. In precincts 73
and 103 there were similar changes at
the last moment- Â«â¢
WERE SUMMARILY DISPLACED.
It is common report that a number of
those who had been regularly appoint
ed desired to serve as election officr?
but were not allowed to do so, being
displaced by the midnight appoint
ments. The rosters sho^v much fraud
In these precincts and the attention of
the Grand Jury was therefore drawn
to the actions of the Election Commis
sion. â¢ ,â . t . .
The Commissioners declare that the
substitute appointments ' at "the 'elev
enth hour were made because those
who had been regularly appointed sig
nified tbeir.Inability to serve. They as
sert that resignations are on file in the
Registrar's office ' from every election
officer who was 'displaced. The mem
bers of the board are certain that they
will be called upon to answer indict
ments, and are loud 'in the declaration
that the grand Jurors are unscrupu
lously "doing politics."
The Grand Jury also took testimony
regarding the conduct of the election
in precinct 103. the roster of which
reveals illegal voting on an extensive
ecale. The witnesses examined were
Joe Hayes. J. R. Pringle. Curtis Hill
yer, M. C. Davis. Policeman Henry J.
Pyle. Police Sergeant William Wil
liams and Detective J. F. Dinan.
Hayes. Pringle and Hillyer told of the
misconduct they saw on the part of
alleged stutters. The Incident was In
quired, into of the man who attempted
to vote another's name and ran away
when he was challenged.
NO TRACE OF STEFFEXS.
Captain of Detectives Burnett took
steps last night to institute an ener
getic hunt for Adolph Stefffens, who
was indicted by the Grand Jury for Il
legally voting the name of C. C. Crew
at the primary election. The captain
gave it as his opinion that Steffens had
fled the city. No trace has been found
of him since the bench warrant was is
sued. He was last seen on Thursday
night
The petition of Charles Wyman to be
freed of the charge of ballot-box stuf
fing on the ground that the primary
law Is unconstitutional was heard by
Judge Sloss of the Superior Court yes
terday, the defendant being In court on
habeas corpus proceedings instituted
last Friday while his preliminary ex
amination was in progress before Po
lice Judge Cabaniss.
It is not regarded as likely that
Judge Sloss will upset the primary law.
In any event he will not permit any
delay of the case so far as he Is con
cerned, for he made the announcement
that "he would render his decision at 10
o'clock to-morrow morning.'
At 11 o'clock the examination before
Judge Cabaniss is to be resumed, and
Judge Sloss will relieve, any uncer
tainty in time for the proceeding in
the lower court.
The whole day was consumed by the
attorneys ' in their arguments yester
day, Â¦ R. H. Countryman pleading for
the defendant and John A- Hosmer,
special prosecutor employed by the
Merchants' Association, for the people.
The. chief point advanced by the peti
tioner was that the requirement that a
party shall have cast 3 per cent of the
total vote at the preceding election to
entitle it to hold a convention and ob
tain, place on the official .ballot is In
conflict with the provisions of both the
State and United States constitutions
as to" discrimination' in privileges.- He
pointed out' that a party that is a na
tional' factor and substantially organ
ized might in some communities be de
barred, under the law, from participa
tion in an election/
'To this contention Hosmer urged that
there must be regulation and that the
3 per cent regulation was not discrim
inative. Any body of persons, who
could present; a' petition . with 3 per
cent of Â¦ the voters. Â¦ would be given the
same '? privileges ! as .are granted to es
tablished parties. 'In this manner fair
play was assured to all in a reasonable
manner.", r
An official investigation of the street
car accident on Sunday at Clement

Frederick Fer.s-ten and Ham' Curran

BERKELEY, Oct. 3.â With devilish
Intent a burglar forced his way Into
the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ezra Dean
at 2130 Essex street at an early hour
this morning, prepared- with a sponge
ful of chloroform to stupefy the occu
pants so that he might rob the house
without molestation. The desperado,
however, reckoned without Miss Flor
ence Dean, the daughter of the house.
By summoning her courage and using
a little strategy, she put him to flight
and prevented what mignt have been
a tragedy. While making his hasty
departure the burglar dropped the
sponge with its subtle poison and this
Is now preserved as a souvenir by the
Dean family.
Miss Dean is a trained nurse and that
perhaps is why an unusual, rasping
noise awakened her out of a sound
sleep at 2 o'clock this morning. She
knew that something was wrong and
so got up to listen, at the same time
acquainting Mrs. W. D. Mills, her
sleeping * companion, with - her fears.
The two women listened a little while
In the hallway upstairs before they be
came convinced from the noise that
some one., was unlawfully in the house.
The noise continued in spite of a con
tinual conversation kept up by Miss
Dean and Mrs. Mills. Soon they heard
the door leading from the dining-room
downstairs into the hallway opened by.
the bold intruder. It was time then for
action and Miss Dean turned on the
electric lights in all the upstairs rooms.
The sudden illumination revealed the
shadow of a man silhouetted on the
wall. "At the same, time there came
from below a strong smell of. chloro
form, which the women recognized at
once. . .
, Even with the light' and the voices
the burglar did not seem to be deterred
from his purpose, evidently believing
that the women were alone in the
house and that he could overpower
them with the deadly drug he carried.
He kept mounting the stairs one by. one
and had gained the first -landing be
fore Miss Dean had thought of another
strategy.
"Father! Father," she cried, at this
critical moment, "hurry with the gun!
He's coming up the stairs. Hurry!'
Mr. and Mrs. Dean had been awak
ened by the strange noise In the house
and had hastened to' see what it was
all . about. As â¢ a precaution . Mr. Dean
brought his shotgun along; with him,
but It was not loaded. An unloaded
gun Is of little use against burglars
and recognizing this Mr. Dean, sought
for ammunition. It was while he was
searching for >a cartridge that "Miss
Dean called upon 1 him to â¢hurry.- A mo
ment later he. found the cartridge and
clicked It into the gun. ,-. Â¦;,
The loading of the gun convinced the'
burglar that a warm reception ' await
ed him and his courage failed '-'Â¦ him.
Without uttering a- word he rushed
down the stairs and out of the house
by the way he had 'entered and disap
peared over" the rear fence. If he had'
gone around the "front \ way .' he would
have been shot, for Mr. Dean was pre
pared to fire upon him. In looking
over the house afterward the family
found the chloroform-soaked sponge on
thej floor. : v , ...'. - >
"It was a thrilling experience," ' said
Miss Dean to-day. * "My friend heard
seme one walking up and ddwn in front
of the house very early this morning,
though we thought nothing cÂ«f At. Later
we heard a rasping. noise at the. back
of the house.' but thought It came from
next door. But when it got nearer we
got ; up â¢ and , investigated, with ; the re
sult that we founda burglar." The fel
low., undoubtedly .intended to . chloro^
form us. . I could smell â¢ the-: chloroform
"Examination of the premises shows
that the burglar entered the house by
breaking a window lock on a window
opening upon the rear porch.
the moment he opened the. door. He
must ; have been a bold burglar, be
cause they generally get frightened
away when they know they are de
tected."

DES MOINES, Iowa, Oct. 3.â Mrs.
Maude Hamilton, a pretty stenogra
pher, receiving a salary of $6 a week.
Is blamed for a shortage of $40,000 or
thereabouts, which has been discovered
In, the accounts of the Iowa LlUIolet
Gold Dredging Company and Hawkeye
Company, organized for the purpose of
dredging the Frazier River in British
Columbia. Mrs. Hamilton has a re
cently acquired penchant for exquisite
gowns and luxurious equipages, in
which she often appears on the street.
Â£Jie..; admits that, she burned certain
records of the two companies, but
claims she was directed by her em
ployers to do so.
The v sltuation"'is complicated by an
action in the District Court to declare
Byron A. Bliss,' secretary and manager
of the Joint companies, insane, his wife
being the plaintiff. The shortage has
caused a tumble in value of the min
ing stock from 60 cents a share to 13
cents a share. Hundreds of Iowa peo
ple, Including scores of prominent poli
ticians, are losers by the sudden drop
in the stock in sums ranging from $5 to
$50,000.

PRETTY WOMAN
UNDER A CLOUD
The error occurred in a story by
Lawrence J. Kennedy, under the title
"Beer and 'Baccy." While endeavor
ing to show that college men drink
beer and smoke like other human be
ings the author pointed out a number
of men prominent in college affairs
who indulge in these pastimes. Re
ferring to .these students, he said:
"In the center of one group will be
found a Phi Beta Kappa, in another
the A. S. U. C. Prex; perhaps there
will be a bunch of college journalists
In evidence; the college yell leader
forms the nucleus for another group."
The "A. S. U. C. Prex" means the
president of the associated student3
of the University of California. This
Is Harry Dehm.who, as the holder^ of
the most dignified office in the gift* of
the students, objected to being pro
claimed as a man of bibulous habits,
when he is not. A conference was
held then, and with the result that
every number of the paper was gath
ered up and destroyed.

Oakland Office San Francisco CaO,
1016 Broadway, Oct. 8.
In th.a presence of his mother and
a slater and after a desperate battle
with his friend, Lorenzo Shlman.
Charles Branin, a copyist in County
Clerk J. P. Cook's office, committed
suicide at 8 o'clock this morning by
cutting hi3 throat with a razor at his
residence at San Lorenzo. Branin was
deranged from drink, and worry over
money matters. He lived only a few
minutes after the deed was accom
plished.
During the struggle with his friend,
Shlman was badly cut on the face and
bands. Branin had procured a razor
from a bureau, and it was in an ef
fort to take the keen-edged weapon
away from the demented man that the
etruggle occurred. Branin managed
to break away from Shiman's grasp
and to slash his own throat from ear
to ear before the other man could
reach the crazed copyist.
The young man's mother and sister
had been called to the room to Quiet
the raving sufferer. It was while they
with Shlman were soothing him that
Branin suddenly jumped out of bed
&nd grabbed the razor from the bu
reau. Shiman sprang at his friend
and tried to wrest the razor from
him. The pair struggled and fought
until Branin got away by hacking his
captor over the face and hands with
the blade.
For several days Branin had been
acting strangely. Testerday morning
he went to the Shlman place and de
manded a revolver, saying enemies
were trying to kill him and his moth
er. Sbiman refused to give his friend
a pistol, but to quiet him returned
with the young man to* the Branin
home, where he remained -with him
until his death. During the night
Branin teas restless and often arose
and excitedly paced the bedroom floor.
His companion as often induced him
to return to bed. Shortly before 3
o'clock Branin again left the bed and
it was soon afterward that ! the end
came.
Behind the story of the suicide lie a
variety of contributing causes. Among
them wias Branin's morbid fretting
over a suit that was brought against
him by G. W. Fisher, an assignee of
creditors of Captain William Roberts
of San Lorenzo.
For some reason not explained
Branin had made a great ado over
the litigation and had become very
despondent, fearing he was going to
lose the case.
As he was abundantly supplied with
means it could not be understood why
he should seem so bothered about the
suit. Branin had not been at his post
in the County Clerk's office for a week,
devoting his time to the case, which
had been on trial. He told Deputy
County Clerk William Zambresky that
he would commit suicide If he lost.
Branin then started on a drinking
bout and wound up at home in a very
nervous plight.
Shortly before the big Klondike ex
citement Branin went to -Alaska and
struck rich claims, cleaning up about
$100,000. He returned to San Loren
zo, built a pretty home and estab
lished a stock farm and racing stable.
He was well known among horsemen
and was accounted a good fellow, lib
eral with his money and generous to
those who needed help.
Two years ago he wedded a Miss
Baxter of Berkeley. She Is with her
mother in the college town, having
presented her husband with a son.
Branin was 29 years old. He leaves
besides his wife, child and his mother,
two brothers and two, sisters, Who are
Jchn, William, Mamie and Grace
Branin. Deputy Coroner Geary of
Haywards took charge of the case.

land. Oct. S. â Trial of the damage Â«uit of
Mary KenneSy ajrainpt the Oakland Transit
Consolidated for $35,000 was bepun in Judr*
Meivln'* court to-day. The plaintiff says she
Â¦was thrown from a hay wagon on Park street
two ypar* a.go, when one of the corporation's
can collided with the wagtm. and that she
bruised and mangled under the car, losing
a leg by amputation later as a result of the
â¢iccldent.
"I am not prepared to name them to
night," replied Aitken, "it's too soon
after the bond election. In view of that
election," he continued, "I should like
to have a special meeting called to con
sider a matter of waty supply."
. Councilman Fitzgerald wanted the
meeting to .be confined to a discussion
of â¢Altken's scheme,: but Councilmen
Cuvelller, Elliott, Wallace and Howard
said the subject should be left open for
any proposition that might be offered.
The Council passed to print ordi
nances as follows: Calling for bids to
reconstruct the City Prison; fixing the
tax levy at St 26; establishing Harrison
boulevard, and appropriating $13,000 to
Improve it; calling for bids to paint the
City Hall.
Aitken replied : "I have a plan, but I
am not prepared to submit it to-night.
I understand that parties with a water
plan were unable to submit it. It's a
shame when capital from the East
can not get a hearing."
"Name them, name them," demanded
President Dornin.
"Now, Mr. President, I do not want
to be unnecessarily personal, but we
have submitted to considerable nag
ging from one of our own members
time and again. In private and in pub
lic we have been told that we would
not consider any water bond proposi
tion. WÂ£ e have, always met these re
marks with the request that the mem
ber give us the benefit of any water
scheme' he may have, pledging our
selves to a full and fair consideration
of the same, but no scheme has been
forthcoming.
"In an article which appeared In our
evening papers, under date of SeDtem
ber 26, written by, or, to be more ex
act, signed by G. E. Aitken. the fol
lowing language appears: 'I am sure
a first-class plant with new distrib
uting system . could be got from more
than one company,' and further on.
'I am perfectly sure' a new municipal
water supply is practicable and avail
able for our .city.'. In consideration of
these remarks and believing this an op
portune time I. now In all candor. and
sincerity, not in order to vindicate any
action . this Council may have taken,
but as a matter of the greatest impor
tance to the inhabitants of this citv.
wish to ask Mr. Aitken through the
chair whether he has at present any
plausible water scheme by which this
city may obtain ' municipal ownership
of a water supply, and I respectfully
await an answer."
"For those repeating these reports in
ignorance or from the force of habit
of criticizing any administration which
happens to be in power I have a feeling
of pity. For those maliciously spread-
In these reports. I have a' feeling of
contempt, and for those making use of
this means with 'politics aforehtought'
I have a feeling of disdain.
"I am satisfied that the public gen
erally is convinced that we have given
every water proposition which has been
placed before us a fair and full Investi
gation, and that we deplore the fact
that up to the time when we were pre
pared to submit the improvement bonds
no scheme for water which we could
honestly place before the voters of our
city was at our command.
OAKLAND, Oct. 3.â ThÂ« City Council
to-night called a special meeting for
next Monday night to consider any
plans that might .be submitted for the
purchase of a municipal water supply.
This action followed a lively Inter
change of words, during which Coun
cilman G. E. Aitken was taken to task
by Councilmen Meese and Howard.
Meese Quoted statements made by Ait
ken, who had said he was sure a prac
ticable and available supply was to be
procured. Messe invited Aitken to pre
sent his scheme If he had any.
Aitken declared, that he was not
ready to make his plan public and
asked for a week's time. In the course
of his remarks he intimated that East
ern capitalists had been denied oppor
tunity to present a project. This
brought Councilman John L. Howard
to his feet with a declaration that he
resented innuendoes and mlsstate
ments. Howard said:
"When Mr. Aitken says this council
has not made an attempt to solve the
water problem he makes a mlsstate
ment that should be denied- The prop
osition he talks about would be laugh
ed at If It were made public. Work on
this water question has not stopped
and it is wrong for any member to say
that this council has ceased t odo its
duty. Such a statement is baseless."
In his challenge to Councilman Alt
iken, Meese said:
"During the last few months reports
have been circulated regarding the at
titude of this council in the water ques
tion. The persistent efforts of some
persona to have it appear that we had
absolutely shelved all consideration of
projects looking to the municipal own
ership of a water supply have no doubt
had some effect upon cl part of our
constituents, especially when these re
ports were made by those who knew
better. Â«

and kindred" amusements kept the
children busy and out of mischief
during the intermissions of one of the
best amateur programmes ever seen
on any stage in this city.
To say what was the chief attrac
tion would be almost impossible. The
turnstiles at the gates showed that
almost 8000 persons passed in during
the afternoon. A casual observer on
the inside would come to the conclu
sion that the turnstile made half
rates on its register, as such an as
semblage of merry, romping children
has rarely been seen in this city. Of
course there were mammas, -papas
and aunties along to see that no acci
dents happened. The teachers also
kept a watchful eye on their charges,
but a guardian would require as many
eyes as a centipede has legs to keep
track of what was doing among the
mass of romping, care-free children.
Chief among the attractions was the
entertainment In the big theater. The
only complaint made regarding . it
was that the theater could not hold
enough people. Before the doors
were thrown open to the public every
seat had been sold. Those who were
disappointed yesterday have one con
solationâthere will be other enter
tainments just as good during ' the
week.
The day was an ideal one so far as
climate was concerned. In the morn
ing the heavy fog which hung over
the city caused gloomy forebodings,
but before the sun Wad passed the me
ridian line the last trace of fog had
disappeared and the varied attrac
tions were enjoyed to their fullest ex
tent by the children.
The programme yesterday was as
follows:
Part I â Chorus, pupils of the Pacific Heights
School; selections from "Robin Hood" (De
Koven): "Aloha," Hawaiian song, directed by
Miss Estelle Carpenter, twioervispr of music.
Miss Fannie - Bliven accompanist; Scotch reel

afternoon until they closed at 6
o'clock last night the spacious
grounds were filled with a merry

the court set a limit of thirty days for

Denman, who represented
the Bar made some
venomous remarks in referring to the
conduct of the accused. Collins, while
plainly hurt by the apparently un
necessary personal observations of his
opponent, made a very' manly reply
which seemed to arouse the sympa
thies of his hearers. The accused at
torney also intimated that he would
begin an action for perjury against
those responsible for the charges.
.The principal . against
Collins is that he declared his wife's

In accordance -with a previous un
derstanding with the Finance Commit
tee E. P. JE. Troy yesterday filed a
communication with the Supervisors,
in which he submits a number of ques
tions to the United Railroads for an
swer by the corporation. Troy alleges
that the company. is giving poor serv
ice and that 4534 persons have been
injured on its cars, thirty-six persons
having died in 1903 from street car
accidents. â¢ Troy says further that the
company is using parts' of streets that
It has no right to and that the bad
condition of street pavement and dan
gerous rails still continues except on
Third street and' for three 'blocks on
Kearny street. -Troy requests the Su
pervisors to exact jfrom the railroad
company detailed Information relative
to its stocks, bonds, financial opera
tions, assets, cost of road, additions
made to the system, income account,
rentals and other matters. Follow
ing are some "of the questions which
Troy wants the company to answer:
Under what franchise and what clause of
name are curves laid at the corner of Post
and Kearny streets and D street and Sixth
and Eighth avenues?
What other curves have been laid during
the last two years, and under what franchise
rights? ,>-">
- . What franchise does the company claim to
hold that It is not now using: the whole or
any part of? Give the name of the streets
or curves?
What is the headway of the Fourth and
Ellis street cars and what was the headway
before the adoption of the present timetable?
vHow many "runs" have been . taken Â¦ off or
added to this line by the last change in time
table?
What are the changes in headway and
runs on each route In the city by the last time
table? â¢
How many car washers are in the employ
of the company? Give the number at each
barn and the number of cars in the barn.
How often Is each car washed?
- What is the 'method of washing cars?
What is the actual cash expended upon the
property and equipment?
How much of this has been spent outside of
San Francisco?
- What' is the cash value of the property, le^s
depreciations, not including franchise values?
What do you value the franchises at?
What sum has bfen written oft' for depre
ciation?
What is the amount of stock issued?
' What is the amount of bonds .issued?
What is the par value of. each, the market
value to-day, and what has been the lowest
market quotation of each, and the highest,
and on what date?
âWhat provision has been made for a sinking
fund for the bonds?
To what bonds does the sinking fund ap
ply, and how much to each issue?
Mr. Ehrhorn, quarantine officer for
the Horticultural Commissioner of Cal
ifornia, recognizes the danger. He said
yesterday that the Horticultural Com
missioner was anxious to have the veg
etable grower protected against all
pests and has instructed that every
precaution vhall be taken to keep out
the cucumber fly. The work of guard
ing the borders grows steadily more
important. With the increase of com
merce with other countries the danger
increases. The cucumber fly has wings
and the power to carry pest breeding
eggs all over the country if once an
entrance is grained through a Pacific
Coast port. Mr. Ehrhorn has heard
about the menace in China and Japan.
The cucumber fly. once introduced, will
be â¢ thousand times harder to fight
than ever the San Jose scale was. No
cucumbers, melons or anything that
could be supposed to harbor the cu
cumber fly have been permitted to
enter this port for some years. Un
â¢â¢easirg vigilance will be necessary to
keep the guard against pests. The
may be brought in soil. -Every
fruit grower, every raiser of vegeta
bles and every business man in the
State is interested in the exclusion of
the cucumber fly.
To the vegetable grower the intro
duction into California of the fly would
be disaster. Fruit pests have caused
damage to the amount of many mil
lions of dollars to orchardlsts. The cu
cumber fly would harm the vegetable
farmer just as badly, in a financial
China and Japan have suffered
largely. In certain parts of the world
the cucumber files, which carry the
formidable scientific name of Dacius
cucurbitae and still thrive perniciously,
have so ruined crops of melons and
cucumbers that such products can be
raised only under glass or netting and
the price is almost beyond reach. A
email melon brines $1. Other sorts of,
vegetables that have been mentioned
in the foregoing carry corresponding
rates when marketed.
The vegetable growers of California
and, indeed, of the entire United States
are threatened by the cucumber fly.
This fly destroys watermelons, cucum
bers, muskmelons, pumpkins and to
matoes. So rapidly does the cucumber
fly multiply that no tomato or melon
or cucumber is permitted to get half
ripe before it is punctured and made
the depositary of eg-gs. The eggs soon
hatch Into niagrgrots and soon the en
tire melon is ruined.

NOW that the ashes of the Panama affair are being assiduously
raked over by Democratic leaders in the hope that some small
coal therefrom may be blown into the flame of opposition,
there comes from General Rafael Reyes, President of Colombia, a
statement calculated to give pause to the wheezing Democratic bel
lows. General Reyes, who represented his country at Washington on
a special mission after the acknowledgment of the Panama republic,
and who new sends to the Colombian Congress his official mes
sage concerning the same, arraigns the short-sighted policy of that
body in its entire dealings with the United States and declares that
Colombia has no one but herself to blame for, the loss of the isthmus
province. v -
"We must aamit," reads President Reyes' message, "that the
United States Government had granted to us by way of compensa
tion in the Hay-Herran treaty much more than we had asked in the
memorandum of our Minister at Washington, which served as a
basis of that treaty. Con\paring these two documents the United
States might well point to the generosity of its dealings with Co
lombia and obtain the public opinion of the civilized world in con
sidering as an indisputable fact that the obstinacy of our Govern
ment was the only real obstacle to the construction of the canal by
the United States." - .^ :
This review of the case by the President of the republic which
has been held up by the Democratic press and Democratic speakers
as the innocent victim of spoliation and oppression by a stronger
power certainly throws a new light upon affairs. General Reyes,
one of the very few statesmen of the South American state worthy
the name, and who was unalterably opposed to the grasping and
short-sighted policy of the Colombian Congress, now as head of the
nation places the onus of Colombia's loss where the administration
at Washington first placed it when Panama became recognized as
an independent state.
Under this new aspect of affairs our friends on the other side
must fly in the face of Colombia itself when they continue to draw
a political moral from the incident in question. Now we may enjoy
the comedy of a general negation, not only of the official words of
the President of the United States, but of the President of Colombia.
The spectacle will have its instructive aspect likewise.'
PRESIDENT REYES VERSUS THE DEMOCRATS.
The census figures show not a decrease in the number of people ]
in this country engaged in gainful vocation', but a large increase. The j
number of merchants increased between 1880 and 1890 38 per cent, '
and the number of drummers or commercial travelers in the same
time increased 228 per cent, proving an increased demand for their 1
services, through the activities of competitive trade. In the twenty i
years ending with 1900 the population increased 52 per cent and ,
the number of merchants 73 per cent. Along the whole line of occu- j
palions, manual, professional and mercantile, there was an increase
in the number profitably employed.
Conditions bear no more resemblance to those preceding the :
French revolution than Hearst bears to a patriot and decent
American. His editorial misrepresents his country and .his coun- |
irymen. Yet it is characteristic of him. In public matters he thinks j
in the terms of lawlessness and murder. His ideas run to assas- j
sination. He declared his purpose in an editorial in 1901 to make â¢
people discontented, saying it in these terms: "You should be in as
many ways as possible a breeder of discontent among the human '
beings around j'ou." Then after denouncing McKinley as "An
abject, weak, futile and incompetent poltroon," he continued for i
weeks and months his analogies drawn from the French revolution. 1
After the President was murdered Hearst was run to cover by j
universal public indignation, and did not venture out again until he j
emerged as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the Pres- j
idency. What a spectacle is presented by the fact that he was the
second choice of that party as the nominee and came near being j
first! _ ' â¢ .. .., ,... . I
Now he is growing bold in the public forgetfulness of events j
leading up to the assassination of McKinley and is beginning again ,
his propaganda of discontent with murder as the remedy of the '
evils he pretends to see in our economic conditions. All this is done
with a cold heart and a deliberate purpose, to secure for himself and
his party advantage by grossly defaming his country. There are !
plenty of fools and featherheads, non-thrifty and crooked thinkers !
whose addle brains are tinder for his torch, and no one need be sur- â¢
prised if his tactics shall lead up to an attempt to enact another j
national tragedy. |
This false and incendiary talk is an invitation to lawlessness,
disorder and murder. Its falsity is proved by every man's knowledge
of conditions in this country.
MR. HEARST is getting back to the politics of the French revo
lution. For more than a year before the assassination of
President McKinley Mr. Hearst likened him to Louis XV Ij
and said that ne:ct to ex-President Cleveland he was the most j
hated and despised man in the Western hemisphere. Conditions in I
this country then were likened by Mr. Hearst to the conditions pre
ceding the reign of terror in France, and anarchists were invited to
quit conspiring against the lives of small fry and to strike at the
lug ones. The morning: of the day on which the President was
murdered Mr. Hearst printed a cartoon of him as a negro minstrel
doing a clog and a coon song in which he expressed his delight at
ihc suffering of what Hearst calls "the common people."
He has now renewed this kind of- campaigning in an editorial
in which he says: "There is always muttering among the poor j
and feeble. They are always dissatisfied, but they amount to little j
and their voices do not travel very far. There was much sighing, j
weeping, starving in France before the great revolution came. Peas- j
ants died of the plague in tens of thousands and ate each other's ,
dead bodies. Mankind in the mass were slaves, but the able men
always found a comfortable little place at the top. The danger:
came, and poor fat old Louis lost his head when the able men began j
10 grumble. In this country the grumbling no longer- comes merely j
fiom the cheap, small fry that can be bought at the polls â or bought j
more cheaply later in Legislatures. You have the whole class ,of j
American bankers worrying about themselves. You have the big
class of lawyers worrying about themselves. They find the great trust
killing off the small merchant and manufacturer with his myriad of
lawsuits. The drummers of America, another active and influential
class, have had their severe dose of medicine. Push these gentlemen
away from the trough as you are now doing and you "will have trou
ble on your hands which will become part of history â and be written
on vour tombstone."

-PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PLuVXET
JUPITEK SHOWING ITS SUR
FACE PECULIARITIES.
DURING these weeks the Jovian
planet, now bo conspicuous in the
east, fully Justifies its prehistoric
name. Temporarily at least, it is
the monarch of the starry sky. Not
since the autumn of 1892 has It shone
so brilliantly as at -present, surpassing
even Venus going down In the west as
the great planet rises. On October 18,
when our earth, speeding onward in
its orbit .comes between the sun and
Jupiter,' the latter will not be many
degrees past the point of Its elliptical
path nearest to the luminous central
orb. The combined results of opposi
tion and of Jovian perihelion bring us
within about 370,000,000 miles of Jupi
ter, which is 46.000,000 miles nearer
than in March, 1898, when opposition
occurred, not far- from the point of
Jovian aphelion. â¢-
These opportune seasons recur at in
tervals of about twelve years, in which
time Jupiter completes a revolution
around the sun. On the last occasion,
September, 1892. Professor Barnard dis
covered a fifth satellite with the 36-
Inch Lick refractor. Only a hundred
miles in diameter, it goes around the
planet twice a day, and was undis
covered heretofore, though since recog
nized in a few large telescopes. This
great discovery may not be rivaled dur
ing the present season, but neverthe
less, the medium-sized and the small
telescope, the opera-glass'and even the
naked eye can be used with effect at
the time of nearest approach. For
large instruments the chief investiga
tion will be as to the condition of the
Jovian surface. Unlike the moon, Mars
and our globe, the surface of Jupiter
is a scene of such frequent change that
it is 'considered to be in a sun-like con
dition, though * cooled and no longer
self-luminous. The great size of the
planet, which is 87,000 miles in diameter,
would necessarily prolong the process
of cooling beyond that of smaller bod
ies, while expansion, caused by fierce
internal glows, would maintain the Im
mense volume in contrast to its light
mass, which is only 316 times that of
the earth.
Though sharply outlined, the colos
sal sphere is now regarded as a mass
of heated vapor, nearer to. the consis
tency of water than to that of air, of
various densities, not only in the up
per strata, . but at depths visible
through its nearly liquefied substance.
It may have no solidity even at its
center.
Such a body cannot be readily lik
ened to the crusted earth, with its shal
low, transparent atmosphere imme
thodically cloud-strewn. The coldness
of space and sunlight affect the differ
ing densities of the Jovian surface
more symmetrically and Its tinted belts
extend parallel to its equator, though

Thus, to telescopic vision, Jupiter Is a
pale golden orb, oval in form and pro
fusely garlanded with crimson hues.
The rapid rotation of the still plastic
mass has compressed the polar dlam-'
eter to the' extent of 5000" miles." Its
tinted aspect may be due to alternate
zones of different density, the belts be
ing translucent spaces of great depth,
suffused with sunlight and reflecting
only the red rays. Frequent changing
in number and in form, their gnarled
edges jind their tendency to spotted
ness indicate that turbulent motion
show that Jovian equatorial markings
have not always the swiftest motion,
, that an occasional spot beyond the
central zone rotates in nine hours fifty
minutes, 'and that adjacent spots may
give contradictory evidence. Accord
ing to this skilled observer, sub
mergence is the explanation of such
discrepancies, which in that case are
only seeming. The accuracy attained
is indeed more striking than the dis
cordance of the results, rievond this
visible surface there prcrbablv extends
an enveloping atmosphere, as the disk
has the sunlike feature of -decreasing
luster near the limb. Besides the end
less changes of its diversified surface,
the interesting planet also varies the
circuit of its* satellite system by
transits, eclioses and occupations.
Some London observers have been re
cently discussing, rather skeptically,
the visibility of the larger moons with
out magnifying power, which is> not
surprising in a locality where fog and
smoke obscure the sky. In the high
Sierras they have been seen by Pro
fessor George Davidson and Professors
Barnard and See have also been able
to ~ discern them at the altitude of
Flagstaff; Ariz. The third and fourth
satellites are about 3000 miles in diam

the date of opposition, October 18, this
interesting " observation may be re

For shirt waists there's a new fab
ric. It is the richest looking stuff,
though it has not a thread in it that
isn't cotton. But it is mercerized cot
ton, and that makes all the difference
in the world. The goods is very soft,
heavy and rich looking, and of a
handsome canvas or basket weave.
This new stuff comes in a variety of
plaids, about half of the surface of
each being white. In one of these
blue will predominate; In another red
and in still another green, says an ex
change. /<\
These plaids come at a most oppor
tune time. A pleasing novelty is al
ways acceptable, and just now, when
womankind is keeping her eyes open
for something not entirely common
place for her winter shirt waists, it is
particularly timely.
One admirable feature of this fab
ric for the Ubiquitous shirt waist Is
that it will require no trimming. And.
in fact, the plainer it is the better, it
will look. This is very likely to be
the case with heavy goods, and as for
plaids, we all know what ticklish
things they are to trim. Well cut
with a few, plaits so laid as not to
make ugly breaks in the pattern of
the plaid (this is an important item),
this new stuff Is certain to be fetching
and to be a desirable addition to any
woman's collection of cool and cold
weather wear.* With a white collar
and a plain silk tie a woman will be
well dressed above the belt, at any
rate.

automobile companies in this city had
each lost $30,000 or more in the busi

feur of an automobile was paid $1 50
per hour, the entire cost of operating
a machine being $3 76 per hour, not
counting depreciation. He said the
rate charged in New York and Chicago
was $4 per auarter. Supervisor Rea
said the License Committee had done
all in its power to secure information
on the subject, but about all that could
be obtained was that the automobile
companies were losing money, only one
company acknowledging that it had
made any profit. Brandenstein said
the $3 rate was mere guess work and
the ordinance should be recommitted
to the Committee on Streets and Li
cense for investigation as to the cap
ital invested in the business, the net
profit on each machine and other data.

when Clerk "Barney" Conlan intrepidly
went to his rescue and succeeded, not
without difficulty, In disintegrating the
discordant quartet. And thereafter, un
til the case was .disposed of and the
ladles had left the courtroom, the
trustworthy clerk protected his Honor
from a recurrence of the unseemly
clamor. With admonitory forefinger he
wagged to silence any "lady"' who
started to speak, while another "lady"
was testifying.
Mrs.' Annie Duffle was formally ac
cused of disturbing the peace of Mrs.
Lillie Terrier. Miss Mulhall and Misa
Spear were witnesses. Several other
women were present and ready to be
sworn, but they were not called to the
stand, .because the Judge declared that
the more evidence he heard the more
perplexed he became as to who or what
was at the bottom of the dispute. Â« The
parties are residents of Guy place, 'a
cul-de-sac shooting westward from
First Etreet, between Folsom and Har
rison. Some time ago Mrs. Duffle ap
peared as complainant against her
mother-in-law and had her bound over
to abstain from disturbing the peace â
that, too, after Mrs. Terrier had given
defendant an excellent character.
Sonn afterward Mrs. Duffle had | Mrs.
Terrier arrested on the charge of petty
larceny, and it was then successfully
pleaded that the charge was simply an
ebullition of the "'complainant's spite
against the defendant. Then Mrs.
Terrier had Mrs. Duffle arrested for
disturbing the peace. Miss Mulhall, in
behalf of the defense, testified that Mrs.
Terrier went to Mrs. Duffle's residence
and deliberately, provoked her to dis
turb the peace by indulging In lan
guage, that no self-respecting person
could listen to without retaliating. Miss
Spear testified that Mrs. Terrier was
one of the gentlest creatures alive, and
would no more think of indulging in
oral abuse of anybody than she would
think of flying. Then it was that the
four "ladies" engaged in the cross
fire of accusations and contradiction
that dumfounded the Judge and
brought out the valor of Clerk Conlan.
"I must dismiss this case," sighed
his. Honor, "because I am unable to
ascertain from the testimony whether
the complainant or the defendant is
most to blame for the alleged peace
disturbance."

-would come over me which no amount of medicine, diet, or exercise
eeemed to correct Your Vegetable Compound found the weak spot
however, within a few weeks âand saved me from an operation --
all my troubles had disappeared, and I found myself once more healthy
and welL Words fail to describe the real, true, grateful feeling that is
m my heart, and I want to tell every sick and suffering sister. Don't
dally with medicines you know nothing about, but take Lydia E. Pink-

different woman in a short time."â Mks. Laura. Emmons, Walker-

It is well to wmemember such letters as above when some druggist trie*
to pet you to buy something which he says is " just as good " That is impos-
Kible.^as no other medicine has such a record of cures as Lydia E. Pink-

Don't hesitate to write to Mrs. Pink ham if there is anything
about your sickness you do not understand. She will treat you
with kindness and her advice is free. Ko woman ever regretted
writing her and she has helped thousands. Address Lynn, Mass.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 3.â In his an
nual report Surgeon General R. M.
O'Rellley says that the general health
of the army has Improved. During the
past year the admission per 1000 had
been 1451.13 against 1616.31 in the pre
ceding year. â¢ This marks a gradual
improvement In . the condition of the
troops which has been noted since sani
tary matters have been given increased
attention, notwithstanding a large Pro
portion of the troops have been on
practically war service in the Philip
pines since 189S. From an average
strength of 19,029 American troops in
the Philippines, 1074 were invalided
home, a. rate of 56.44 per 1000. There
were 271 deaths 'among the troops in
the Philippines, so that the losses by
deaths and invaliding amounted to
70.67 per 1000. Contrary totrhat might
be expected, in view of the general be
lief In the prevalence and severity of
malarial fever in the Philippines, it
was found necessary to send only 59
such cases home. Nearly all of this
number subsequently returned to duty,
none dying. , ' Â»
The' surgeon general believes that It
Is possible to cure leprosy. At any
rate, decidedly favorable results have
followed the. treatment of the leper sol
dier now held in isolation at one of
the Southern army posts. Nodules and
swellings on the body have become either
greatly reduced ' or. tfave disappeared
entirely.-^ Free use Is made of the

merhorn of New York declared to-day
that his son, Amos Schermerhorn, was
the driver of British Secretary Hugh
Gurney's automobile on September 25,
when Gurney was charged with violat
ing the Stockbridge speed ordnance.
Schermerhorn also said that Sheriff
Noble, who made the arrest, was being
given a ride in the machine as an ac
commodation when he apprised the
automobilists that they were exceeding
the speed limit.
Schermerhorn gave out the informa
tion to-day in recognition, as he said,
of the gallantry of Secretary Gurney,
In accepting the entire responsibility
in the matter. His two sons, he said,
bcth of whom are familiar with auto
mobiles, were being: entertained by
Gurney, who personally does not care
for fast driving, but was permitting
the boys to test his machine.
When Arrest Was Made That
Has Caused the Trouble.

The Pacific Mail steamship Mongo
lia, from the Orient, after waiting all
day yesterday off the coaat in a thick
fos. found the atmosphere late in tha
afternoon clear enough to Â£?t her land
bearings and eteam for the entrance of
the harbor. She camÂ« into the bay,
passed Quarantine and tried to make
the wharf at First and Krannan
Ftreeta, but, a hay schooner being di
rectly in the way. the biff liner was
forced to baÂ£k away and come to an
chor at 7 o'clock In the evening off the
Pacific MjMÂ» dock.
September 4 the Mongolia left Hong
kong, Amoy the 5th. Shanghai 8th. Na
kafaJrt lOth. Kobe 12th. Yokohama 17th
and Honolulu 27th. In her cargo are
ES30 bales of silk. SOS bales silk hand
kerchiefs, 23,406 mats and 2578 chests of
tea. She brings in her strongroom
51.000,000 in treasure. The voyage was
uneventful except rough weather in the
Yellow Sea, which, however, hardly
disturbed the huge craft.
Professor J. W. Jinks of the Mone
tary Commission, who has been in the
Orient studying the financial conditions
of those countries, is returning home.
He states that, they are rapidly passing
to the gold standard. Melton Prior of
the Ixjndon News and A- Fischer of the
Liondos. Times are returning home, sick
of Japanese censorship. Tom D. Mc-
Kay, the genial and well-known route
a^ent of the steamship lines in the
East, is taking a &ynx through the
West. A number of Chinese and Jap
anese students axe en route for East
em schools.
Mr. Prior, who Is the veteran of war
correspondents, after eight months at
the front in Manchuria, says:
"I simply dread the outcome of the
present war between Japan and Rus
eia. If It can possibly be settled with
out any European complication it
would be, comparatively speaking, all
right, but I cannot see how that can
be avoided. I am absolutely certain
that somehow or other the powers will
be Involved and then will come the
most awful war in the history of the
world. This is but the beginning."
Captain R. M. Robertson, formerly
commander of the British steamship
Anerly. which yt&s lost near Fusan,
Korea, on July 23, is returning to Eng
land.
She was on her way from Otaro, Ja
pan, to Pasan, with a load of timber
for the new Seoul railway. "When she
Â¦was nearics her destination a heavy
fog caused her to lose her bearings
and she was wrecked on the rocky
coast, about twenty-five miles north of
Fusan. Captain Robertson and his
crew managed to get ashore and went
to iFusan. The better part or the An
erij-'s cargo was salved, but owing to
tbe lack of proper fatalities nothing
could be done to save the vessel. She
was totally wrecked August 25 by a
typhoon, Â¦which also played great havoc

Egan, and many of the residents,
heavily armed, are searching 1 for John
C. WhipDle, who two weeks ago shot
and seriously wounded a neighbor*
James Starmer, and last week shot
State Policeman Loukes, who was at
tempting to arrest him for the crime.
It is suspected also that Whipple'
has burned two barns and consequent
ly all barns stocked with \he season's
crop3 are guarded night and day by
armed farm hands. It is believed that
Whipple is hiding in a cave in Mott
Hill.
OMAHA, Oct. 3. â "Did I say Amer
ican officers should not marry unless
they had an income of $2400 yearly?,
No, sir, I never said anything of the
kind. The newspapers have misquot
ed me on the subject." ,
This statement was made to-day by.
General Henry C. Corbin, who spent
an hour in Omaha on his way to the
Philippines, where he will take com
mand of the forces in place of Gen
eral Wade. General Corbin, however,
proceeded to discuss the theme of
marriage with special reference to
army officers, saying:
"Our army is overmanned. The
pay of a subaltern officer is barely
enough for his proper support and for
the expenses of his equipment and uni
form. If to this are added the inev
itable expenses - attached to a family
it is not only probable, but almost cer
tain that when the officer strikes his
balance at the end of the year he will
be behind if he has no income but his
pay. That a bachelor officer is more
valuable to the service than a mar
ried officer does not follow, nor do I
wish to be understood as so saying.
But the married officer is less valuable
if in marrying he has not - exercised
that prudence which should govern
all transactions in life.
"I am firmly of the opinion that no
officer should enter the marriage rela
tion without first getting authority
from the War. Department and that as
a necessary condition thereto he
should 'make it clear that his income
after marriage will be sufficient to
support himself and family and above
all if he is to live on his pay he should
state on his honor that he is fee from
debt."
General Corbin, who was in the
Philippines three years ago, says he
does not anticipate making any
changes in the policy laid out by Gen
eral Wade.

The Catholic Ladles' Aid Society has
selected December 8 as the date for
opening: its home for, young girls. A
comfortable and commodious house
has been secured on Gough street, near
O'Farrell. where suitable accom
modations will be afforded young
working girls at rates within their
means. , *
The object of this home is to provide
shelter and protection for young wom
en seeking employment, to remove
them from temptations the lack of a
suitable home may be responsible for,
and to secure employment for young
girls who are sent into the world from
the 'various Catholic institutions. . This
proposed work has enlisted for it the
interest and assistance of many promi
nent people and the society feels as
sured of liberal support in Its under
taking.
A number of receptions have been
planned for the near future to pro
vide furnishings for the home. -One
took place on Wednesday evening,
September 28, at the residence of Mrs.
S. McFadden, 1070 Haight street, when
many dozen towels and liberal cash
donations were received. The next re
ception will take place at the residence
of Mrs. K. Gaines, 894 Green street,
where donations of cups 'and saucers
will be* received- * /

HONOLULU, Sept 27. â^For the first
time since rice growing was started In
the Hawaiian Islands rice this yea?
disappears from the list of exports.
Owing: to lack of labor the rice plant
ers are in a bad way and imported
rice now rules the local market. ThÂ»
demand Is large, as rice is the chief
food of the thousands of Asiatic la
borers on the sugar plantations, but
the competition from Texas and
Louisiana is killing: the local industry.

CINCINNATI, O., Oct. 3.â A new
chapter has been added to the matri
monial mishaps of John Fobiano, a
politician connected with the water
works department, who has the unique
record of having: married the daughter
of his divorced wife. The latest de
velopment is a new divorce suit by his
second wife. Â»
Five months after his first wife had
obtained a divorce in 1901. on tho
ground of gross cruelty. Fobiano
married her daughter. Florence. The
mother's cruelty charges were more
severe than those made by the daugh
ter in the petition Just fljed. The
mother claimed that Fobiano threat
ened to kill her, drew a knife on^her,
beat and choked her, smashed dishes
and drove her from home several
times. The daughter claims he beat and
abused her and refused to give up her
wearing apparel. /
This is the daughter's second pleai
for divorce this year, as Fobiano ap
plied for a divorce last February and
she filed a cross-petition, but they sub
sequently made up and lived together.

Omit flowers.CHICAGO, Oct. 8.â At the outset the wheat
market was decidedly weak. Opening quota
tions on December were down }4c to â¢ Â»4c,~ at
$112% to $1 12%. May was off %@>%c to
%Â©%c. at $1 12% to $1 12%c. The factors
that contributed to the initial weakness were
lower, cables, liberal world's shipments ' and
heavy receipts in the Northwest. For a time
commission houses were free sellers and, with,
only a scattered demand. - prices declined still
further. December sold off to $1 11% and May
to $1 12U. On the decline a leading commission
bouse became a heavy buyer, and this support
started active covering by pit traders. who had
sold too freely on the opening weakness. As a
result the ' market suddenly - turned r strong.
Rumors that a leader of the bulls .was buying
heavily through- commission houses, . while sell
ing openly. : caused additional purchases by ; the
pit : crowd. The condition , of - the Sour trade
was a - decided â¢ bull factor. - : Seattle' . reported
having sold 2000 tons of flour for shipment to
Vladivostok, . white Portland advtced . of , tha
sale' of ten Â¦ carloads to New 'England. . Minne
apolis also reported an active 1 demand for flour.

NEW TORK, Oct. Sâ The motives prompt
ir.* orersttwjs in *toeks tc-day were extreme
ly difficult to fathtim owing to the conflicting
movt-mer.t tn different etocks in the earae
jrroapji and supposably under the same in
fluences, but It wl.s not discernible on pen
f-nl lines that tbe tine of sales to realize
was rather heavier than at Â«Â»>- time hereto- ,
.rre on the prw-nt advance and sufficient- to
xtagrer the market, fairly carry It backward
tor a time. The fcrces in the market were
alÂ»le to rally themselves, however, apparently
rf-fre*hed by the extent to which the realirfng
had been carried and t-> mske headway toward
rrtwi'er*'.- The ear!y trading had the advan
tage of the etrong close ;ast week and a still
higher range of prices In Lsndon before the
ope-nicg here. The usual Monday morning ex
pression* from railroad traffic officials were
I-artictilarly rangu'.ne cf future growth of
traffic and reoortea rood actual increase In
freight movement as a retult of the passage
of the corn crop scare. A prominent feature
Â«>f the reports of railroad rmftiness was the re
vival cf improvements and betterments which
had been laid aside owing to the need of re
trenchment of extraordinary expenses. Tee
rmrrhanfils* movement vu reported to be ex
pending, but some falling off was reported in
Â«m? grain movement, especially of corn. - The
Ute riÂ£Â« in the market on Satardav seemed

On thÂ© resulting bulge in wheat here December
advanced to $114% and May to If 14ft;, Dur
ing the last hour the market lost much of lta
newlx acquired strength, the principal depress
ing Influence being an unusually heavy primary
movement. Realising sales caused a consider

close. Final Quotations were: December,
$1 13^01 13*4: May. $1 13*4<8>l 13%.

conditions brought fair selling; of com early
in the session, resulting In a decline from
Saturday's closing quotations. Sentiment at

%@%c to %&%c lower, at 50%c to 50%c, sold
up to 51*8 c and closed at 51c. Local receipts
were 146 cars.

31c, advanced to 31 %c and closed at 31@31&c
Local receipts were 201 car?.

cially of lard, caused strength in provisions.

favorite with San Francisco audiences,
is making the great success of her ca
reer as Dolores in the pretty comic
opera, "The Serenade," at the Tivoli

more marked from the fact that sev
eral artists of eminence have previous
ly given satisfaction in the role, but
it was not till -Miss Condon sang It
that its great possibilities were thor
oughly realized. Her chief opportun
ity occurs in the second act, when she
sings "The Angelus" in a manner

cites an* enthusiasm rarely, witnessed
in a theater. In the duets with For

At a meeting of the executive board
of the Butchers* Exchange last night
reports were received from the agents
and notes made of the names and ad
dresses of those who refused to accept
the new cards. It Is brdadly hinted
that these' men will find difficulty In
procuring a fresh supply of meat when
that on hand is exhausted.
The Butchers' Exchange comprises
all the wholesale and retail butchers
and sausagemakers in this city. Its
membership is abou 400. At last night's
meeting Word was received from the
Butchers' Exchange in Oakland that
the organization on this side of the bay
would receive its hearty support, so it
will be impossible for backsliders from
the ranks to secure a supply of meat
from Alameda' County.
The Journeyman butchers have as yet
made no hostile move." A meeting will
be held Thursday night at the carmen'g
headquarters,"/ when' the open .shop, will
be discussed. The men, 1 so far as can
be learned, are satisfied, as there are
no changes in their hours or wages. A
prominent . official of the union said
last > nisrht that he did not consider a
strike imminent so long as wages and
hours remain the same. A careful
watch will be kept by the exchange and
any member violating the rules by
keeping open late or underpaying his
employes will be punished.
Early yesterday morning agents were
started out from the headquarters of
the Butchers' Exchange to distribute
the cards and but five dealers refused
to sign the agreement and substitute
the "open shop" for the "union shop"
cards. Owing to changes In names and
addresses all the meat dealers In the
city were not approached yesterday,
but they will be located within a few
days and requested to put the blue card
In their window.
This card Is signed by the San Fran
cisco Butchers' Exchange, the Citizens'
Alliance and the Wholesale Butchers'
Association.
We will not discriminate against organized
labor, nor will we compel any employe to Join
a labor union against his wish.
, We will not recognize the business agent or
walking delegate of any labor union, and what
ever privileges they may have had on these
premises in the past are hereby revolted.
The owner of this shop is willing at all times
to listen to any complaint or grievance pre
sented by an employe. The employe* will have
a right to file complaint with this exchange
when they think that any shop owner ia not
treating them fairly, such complaint to be filed,
as an appeal from the decision of the shop
owner, and .we agree that any complaint so
filed will receive prompt attention and <Tie ac
tion it deserves. ,7 Â¦
To Whom It May Concern: From this date
thl3 shop will be run as an open shop, the
owner or owners reserving the right to hire
whom' they please, whether they be union or
non-union men, and to discharge them when
their services are not considered satisfactory
or for any other just reason.
As a result of the action taken at the
meeting of the Butchers' Exchange
Sunday afternoon the "Union Shop"
signs which have been displayed con
spicuously in local meat markets were
removed and in their place Is a blue
card which in bold type makes the fol
lowing announcement:

attention of. charitable persons, many
of whom "dropped dimes and nickela

The object of building the road is to obviate
the necessity of. increasing the present Jerry
service acrotis the bay, as well as to reach the
interior traffic by a more direct route. The
building- of a bridge across the bay will en
able us to run ' direct to San Francisco without
change, thereby paving a 'great- deal of time.
The line on this side of the bay will be
built from Dumbarton Point to Newark, where
It will connect with the South Pacific Coast
Railroad. This latter road is to be converted
into broad gauge, and will connect with the
Southern Pacific system at NUes. thus enabling
us to divert a large amount of traffic from
the present ferry system by going direct to
San Francisco by way of the new -bridge.
The construction work on the new road will
be begun within thirty day* and will be
pushed as rapidly as possible. Wo hope to be
gin operations in a very short time. While
the Incorporators are all Southern Pacific offi
cials, the new road has at present no official
connection with the Southern Pacific Company,
but | it Is probable that it will eventually be
taken over by that company.
Frank Shay, another incorporator of
the | new road, says President E. ,H.
Harriman of the Southern Pacific Com
pany had been considering the building,
of the Newark-San Mateo road for'
more than a year, for Director 'of
Transportation and Operation Julius
Kruttschnitt had thoroughly con
vinced him of the necessity of relieving
the heavy traffic over the bay. Said he:
TO MEET A NECESSITY.
The length of the ferry will be about two
miles. The- entire distance the -line will run
I do not know. "When Senator Fair owned the
Soulh Pacific Coast road he operated a nar
rovr gauge line -for a while over the same
ground upon which we intend building, but
abandoned it because It did not pay. Since
then the franchises have lapsed, but we intend
to renew them.
The building of a road at Dumbarton Point ts
a project that has been in contemplation by the
Southern Pacific Company for some tllne. and
this corporation was formed for the purpose of
carrying it out. The right of way has been
secured and all we need Is terminal facilities
at the point. It Is intended to build a broad
gauge road from Newark to the point and from
the point freight will be ferried across that
narrow part of the bay to the San Mateo shore,
near Redwood City. The whole thing,. will
serve as a connection between the South' Pa
cific Coast road*and the coast road. Ultimate
ly the road will be continued 'from Newark to
Niles, where it will connect with the main
line. The object of making this connection is
to relieve the congestion of traffic at Oakland.
A great amount of freight can be shipped into
San Francisco by means of this new, route.
In time the South Pacific Coast will be-all
standard gauge and the bay will : be bridged
at Dumbarton Point so that traffic may be
moved' without the necessity of ferrying from
Oakland. ._.... ,

Ab a rule, the Southern Pacific Com
pany, in undertaking new railroad pro
jects, 'endeavors to conceal as far. as
possible, its interest in the schemes by
naming as incorporators men who are
not closely identified with the' big cor
poration. . - In the present instance,
however, no effort has been made to
veil the project; with any mystery. On
the contrary, the plans of the company
were fully. stated yesterday. One of
the main objects of the new railroad
company is to carry, freight into the
city .without transhipping it across
the bay from Oakland, thus relieving
the congestion of traffic that now ex
ists between Oakland and San Fran

A gigantic project, involving an ex
penditure of over $1,000,000 and prom
ising greatly to facilitate passenger
and freignt traffic between San Fran
cisco and Oakland and Alameda, has
been made public by the Southern Pa
cific Company.
A corporation, to be known as the
Central California Railway Company,
filed articles of incorporation yesterday
in this city, with the announced pur
pose of building a railroad around the
bay shore from Newark in Alameda
County to San Mateo, a distance of
fifteen 1 miles, connecting at the latter
point with the main lines of the South
ern Pacific. From Newark the new
line will extend! to a point near Potrero
or Dumbarton Point and thence west
erly across the San Francisco Bay.
N The company is incorporated for
$1,000,000, . of which amount $15,000 is
subscribed by the following incorpo

effective. The play goes for all this
week, with > matinees on Wednesday
and Saturday.
And from the pleasing vanities of
"The Office Boy" to the pure austeri
ties of "Everyma/i" was only a step
round the corner, to Lyric Hall. The
sage writing, what a text were here!
As was to be expected the "Everyman"
of last year served as advertisement for
this year's production. A very good,
though not full, house listened to the
play last night. Everyman, when I got
there, was just donning the robe of re
pentance. It was only a moment more
and the spell of the old play was again
upon me.
How many times I saw "Everynan"
last year I have forgotten, but as, then
I found the play last night absorbingly
interesting. Even more profoundly
charming I find Mis Constance Craw.
ley's Everyman, in which, at her flrs't
memorable essay of the part, she so
delighted us last year. The spiritual
quality has deepened, the religious
ecstacy of the repentant sinner is more
fervently expressed, the facial elo
quence more thrilling and what a
preciousness of voice is this that Miss
Crawley brings to her task. Pictur
esquely it is an unforgettable portrait,
and should be missed . by no one able
to sk u^.

Mr. Daniels as the office boy has a
part that he should be grateful for,
almost as grateful as the part should
be for him. He is at his most oleagin
ously unctuous â could one say more?
Yes, one could. Here it is. I saw Mrs.
Daniels, best of wives, convulsed at
the year-old Daniels' jokes!"
But "The Office Boy" by no means
depends wholly upon the little come
dian. The stunning chorus, dressed
and drilled to perfection, holds the cen
ter of the stage without any trouble.
Beside this be-Â£atined array of pul
chritude even the Weber and Fields'
beauties fade away. Then Sally Fisher
sings nicely and leads the ladies, and
Alfred Hickman is the jockey. The
rest don't much matter, but modestly
help Mr. Daniels along. The Daniels
catchword this time? Ask anybody
the day after to-morrow. As It is you,
however, it is very ingeniously
asked â with the right eyebrow tucked
into the hair â "Is my face red?" Go
to see him if you want to know how
funny it is.
Mr. Fairbanks* speech of last nigrht
may have been of more Importance
than Frank Daniels* â thoush you
would ret no one who was at the Co
lumbia to admit it. A heartless editor
(WHO WAS NOT THERE) refuses
space, however, for Frank's thrilling
periods. He surpassed himself last
night, expla&lng that "his proud posi
tion was due to his devotion to Art,
that Intangible something upon the
boundless ocean of.what-you-may-call
'em," andâ but I'm forgetting. As to
"The Ofllce Boy." One has been un
hopefully waiting for something that
would live up to the Daniels speech.
"The Office Boy" comes very near. It
Is the brightest setting that this Ir
regular pearl of a comedian has had
within my memory. Even, and this
says everything, it atones for "Miss
Simplicity." that descended upon us
with Mr. Daniels last year.
All that "Miss Simplicity" was not
"The Office Boy" is. Harry B. #Smith
has done his best in the book, particu
larly in the first act, and to Ludwig
Englander the piece owes, its bright and
taking music. Lyrics are scarce â but
so are singers, except at the Tivoli.
There is one trio, "Signs," that was
entering upon its twenty-seventh en
core as I came back from a peep be
tween times at "Everyman." They
added another dozen or so verses while
I waited. Daniels, Sallie Fisherâ who
really sings â and Sydney Toler have
the song.
