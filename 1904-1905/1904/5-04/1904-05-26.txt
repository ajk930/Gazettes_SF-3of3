The origin of the Merchants' Association
may b* ascribed to an accident. Early la ISM
Mr. Kohlberg and a number of other mer
chants doinc business on Kearny and Post
streets had called a meeting- at the Palace
Hotel to discuss the most effective methods for
making th* Midwinter Fair, then Just opened,
the greatest possible success. Opinions dif-
The Merchants' Association of San
Francl3co celebrated Its tenth anniver
sary last evening in royal style at the
Palace HoteL Three hundred members
gathered around bountifully spread
tables In the great dining-room and
after doing Justice to tae dinner lis
tened to a number of brief, pithy ad
dresses reviewing the work of the or
ganization and pledging its member
ship to still- greater undertakings for
the city's future. The spirit of the cel
ebration was in keeping with the as
sociation's record for "organized good
citizenship."
The gathering was worthily repre
sentative of San Francisco's great bus
iness community. Men were there
whose names are known from the At
lantic to the western coast and far <
across the Pacificâ men of affair?,
leaders in the financial, mercantile,
manufacturing and commercial world.
,But the discussions or- the evenins
were not shop talk. They dealt with
the work done by the association and
planned for the future in behalf of a,
better and greater San Francisco. This
civic purpose of the organization was
kept foremost in all the addresses, and
the speakers dwelt with pride upon its
achievements in promoting tie adop
tion of the new charier, in working for
the enforcement of the charter's civil
service provisions and in the less con
spicuous but not less useful lines of
securing cleaner streets, public Safety
and comfort stations, free rtower mar
kets and the many other practical
benefits conferred by it upon all San \
Franciscans.
A VIGOROUS YOUTH.
The speaking was begun by the
president of the association. Frank J.
Symmes, who bade the guests of the
evening welcome in a happy speech
calling the association to still greater
effort far San Francisco's improve
ment. Mr. Symmes said in part:
Fellow members and gue*ts>: It iÂ« â¢ pleas
ure to welcome you here this evening. Tha I
Merchants' Association stands before you Â«jj
a hippy, healthy boy of 10. with a vigorous
though brief past and giving great promise M
future usefulness to the community. I shall
not enlarg- upon !tt work during the last
ytar because cur annual report has been
placed In printed form by each plat*, and I
uoae you will take tt home and read it.
There are greater opportunities for this as
sociation In the future than it has had in t!><*
past. We have more reasons calling* us tÂ«
civic activity than can be found In almo. r
acy other State or city. Nature has endowed
us with unparalleled advantages. Man has
done but little. There is need for good work
by good men if we are to develop th's great.
State and build the commanding metropolis
that we hope to see bere by the Golden Gate.
The object of the Merchants" Association is
te helD in this work. Its efforts were illus
trcted at tha time ?sn Francisco was threat
ened with a quarantine by the East, whin its
action deferred the danger and led to the or
ganization of a public health commission, with
municipal. State and national representatives,
which Is cleanlri* Chinatown.
I^et us listen to a bit of the history of this
association. It will be relattd hv thÂ« Â«aint!y
founder of our order, Frederick W. Dohrmann.
THE FOUNDER SPEAKS.
Mr. Dohrmann was greeted with
great applause when he rose. He mod
estly disclaimed the honors of. patern
ity and ?aid that th~e origin of the as
sociation was really due to Mrs. Man
fred Kohlberg. who spurred her hus
band to call the meeting cf business
men during the hard times of 13D-I that
resulted in its establishment. The diffi
culties met in forming the new organ
ization were pleasantly described and
the speaker declared that one of the
strongest elements In Its success had
been, its freedom from "knocking." Its
[ members had not gone to the City Hall
| charging municipal officials with cor
ruption, but endeavoring to make them
I think they were the best officials that
ever existed. "So these public officers
have tried to meet us with good ser
vice," said Dohrmann.
I The substance of his address fol
j lows: .
CHEFU, May 26, 11 a. m. â A
junk which left Dalny on the night
of the 23d, and which arrived here
to-day, reports that the Japanese
army had then reached Sanzuripo.
which is north of Dalny and
southwest of Nangalien.
The Russians offered stubborn,'
resistance to the advance of the
Japanese and a battle was fought
at noon of the 22d at Sanzuripo.
The result of the battle was not
learned by the bearers of the news.
The advance of tne Japanese indi
cates that they have recovered
from the reported reverse at Kin
chou.
The Russians at Talienwan
have prepared to destroy the town
upon the arrival of the Japanese.
The Russian plan is to have the
troops on the Liaotung Peninsula
fall back to Potty; Arthur after
IÂ»al>?sihg t\\t: inVaaers. . . .
From the best .information ob
tainable it is learned that the Jap
anese have landed near. Kinchou
and are advancing along the rail
way to" Port Arthur. Those that
landed at Pitzcwo are traveling
down the east side of the penin
sula to Dalny, and those that
landed at Takushan are going to
reinforce the Fengwangcheng
army.

* There were three Presidential ele
ments lnvolA-ed. The Hearst men
originally wanted instructions, but
fhially limited their opposition to the
unit rule. The friends of Colonel James
Kilbourne of Columbus, who was the
â¢ Democratic candidate for Governor
three years agro, wanted indorsement.
S The friends of Judson Harmon of Cin
"cinnatj, who was Attorney General un
der Cleveland, wanted neither Indorse
ment nor instructions, but the unit
rule. The Harmon men won.
The platform, the briefest in the his
tory of "such State literature, was
adopted as it came from Cincinnati,
â¢with the exception of a two-cent-a
mile railroad *are plank that was add
ed at the instigation of Mayor Johnson
of Cleveland, in the convention. The
rural delegates who were co-operating
!n other matters with the conserva
tive?, voted for the two-cent fare
.plank, as did others from the cities,
who insisted that it would be incon
â¢Firtent this year to defeat this resolu
tion, which was a feature of the >'tatÂ«Â»
plntform last year. The vote, how
ever, was very close on the two-cent
fare resolution and the majority for
th<> plank was only 65 out of a total of
723.
The delegate* and alternates at
large are claimed by the conservatives,
v.ho also claimed thirty of the Ohio
district delegates. Their poll of the
Ohio delegation to St. Louis is: Con
servatives (friendly to Harmon), 36;
, Hearst. 6. and Folk 4. and that under
the unit rule adopted the conservatives
â¢will have the Ohio delegation more
than three to one.
The principal plank of the platform
follows:
â¢ "The Democratic party of Ohio, while
firmly adhering to all living Demo
cratic principles, as time and again de
clared by Democratic conventions, rec
ommends that the formal enunciation
of purely national questions be re
ferred to the National Convention,

The conference was warned by sev

there would not be a quorum left, and
the conference would have to adjourn
because it would not be able to trans
act any business.
The conference, after more than two
hours' debate, during which every at
tempt was made by those opposed to
the consolidation of the church benev
olences, by means of parliamentary
filibustering, to block action and to re
commit the whole matter to the com
mittee, finally adopted the report as
originally recommended. Â¦* It consoli
dates the various benevolent societies
under three heads as follows: The
board of foreign missions of the Metho
dist Episcopal church; the board of
home missions and church extension
of the Methodist Episcopal church; the
board of education of the Methodist
Episcopal church, or the board of edu
cation, freedman's aid and Sunday
school of the Methodist Episcopal
church. The exact title of the last
mentioned section was not definitely
fixed.
The report was accepted without de
bate.
Fearing that the conference will not
be able to dispose of all the reports
now before it. Dr.' Buckley to-day
moved to have a special committee ap

most important of the papers now on

views of a large majority of the dele

Another large batch of applications
to be excused from further attendance
was reported by the committee on

half of them were denied by the con

When the case Is recalled at the next
meeting Busse says he will testify that
Regan entered his saloon some three
months ago and requested the Insur
ance of the place. Busse replied that
he could not give it, and Regan insisted,
stating that he was a Police.Commis
sioner and was in a position to do him
a favor. Nothing more was heard of
the matter until the night of the arrest,
and in consequence the saloon man
alleges persecution. Regan is emphatic
in his denial. "I never solicit insur
ance in the first place," he says, j "I
have known this man for some time
and never approached him on such a
subject. I went to Teutonia Hall in the
interest of parents who are raising
children in the neighborhood and in re
sponse to many rumors . concerning
drinking among minors * that have
reached my ears. When the sale of
liquor, was licensed in the hall it waa
understood that only societies should
meet there, but later it turned into a
port o'f 'dancing academy, and many
young people were brought into a bad
atmosphere."
Then the hearing of the case came to
a halt, owing to the fact that the boy
was not present to testify, and a post
ponement was asked by the prosecu
tion until next Tuesday evening. Dur
ing the cross-examination of the po
liceman Attorney Otto turn Suden,
representing Busse, gave the first inti
mation of what his defense would be.
He emphasized the fact that Regan
took an outside officer with him, while
there was an officer detailed specially
to the hall; that the bov was in the
hall proper, and not in the room con
taining the bar, and that the dance
was being conducted by a person other
than Busse. He also brought out that
Busse had been detained at the City
Hall station nearly four hours before
he was permitted to secure his release,
and the line of cross-examination lay
across an area of some malicious per
secution.
BUSSE'S ALLEGATIONS.
On May 11 Commissioner Regan call
ed Policeman Harry Seguine, who was
patrolling his beat on Tenth street, and
requested the officer to' accompany him
to Teutonia Hall at 1322 Howard street,
where a dance was being conducted.
The bar privileges in tnls hall are- in
the name of Busse and the latter also
conducts a saloon In the basement of
the building at the corner of Wash
ington avenue and Howard street. Ite
gan states that he had reason to be
lieve that there were minors attending
the dance and after a tour of the hall,
one Harold Druham, a sixteen-year
old boy residing at 1710 Mission street,
was found to be present. The Commis
sioner and the officer then went to the
saloon below and arrested Busse, and
after some delay, occasioned by a dis
pute as to what violation of the stat
utes the prisoner was guilty of, a
charge of allowing a minor to visit
a place where liquor is served was
placed opposite the saloon keeper's
name. The case was disposed of in the
Police Court three days later and
charges against Busse were filed with
the Police Commissioners.
POLICEMAN ACTS FOlt REGAN.
When the case was called at last
evening's session Regan withdrew from
the board because a party to the
charge. The report of Policeman Se
guine, which isÂ«as follows, was first
read and its contents afterward sub
stantiated by the policeman on the
witness stand:
â¢ At 9:30 p. m.,' May 11. 1904, acting under
instructions- from Police Commissioner Thoma*.
Regan, I accompanied. .him â¢ to the Teutonla
dance hall at I3i*2 Howard street to Investi
gate a Jonce that -was going on there. . Wa
found a minor, who gave the name of Harold
Druhnm and address as 1710 Mission street.
I suhpenaed him us a witness. I arrested the
proprietor, Ludwig Busse. and charged him
with allowing a minor to visit a place where
Ikiuors are served. The proprietor has a
license for a saloon at the corner of Howard
street and Washington avenue; also a license
for a bar at the dance hall. Case called to-day
(May 1-) in Police Court No. 3 and continued
until May 14, 1004. HARRY SEGUINE.
The defense prepared by Ludwig
Busse, a. saloon keeper, who is charged
with having permitted minors on prem
ises where liquor is served, will contain
allegations that Police Commissioner
Thomas Regan attempted to utilize his
official capacity in the furthering of his
personal business interests.
Busse, who stands charged before
the Board of Police Commissioners,
will attempt to show that his refusal
to place his insurance with the Com
missioner led to the filing of the
charges and also to his arrest. Com
missioner Regan denies the insinuation
and says that he stands ready to dis
prove any statements his accuser may
make.

committee made some changes in the
government of the society. It provides
as follows:
'Bishop Fowler, who presided at to
day*: sessions, had a strenuous day of
it. He was firm, however, and in many
Instances ignored parliamentary tech
nicalities entirely. There were appeals
from his decisions, but the majority was
always with him and sustained his rul

the objectors kept the conference in a.
hafpy frame of mind and convulsed
the galleries.

valleys by small locomotives.
About 4 o'clock this afternoon Gen
eral Inside Foreman Gdlden and about
fifty miners boarded a loaded train,
which was about to be hauled from
Bear Valley to Williamstown. Every
thing went all right until about half
of the journey was made, when some
of the men'' attracted the attention of
the engineer, who at once stopped and
it was found that nearly every man In
the party on the cars had been over
come by the gas and sulphur which
emanated from the engine and floated
back over them. The engineer at once
crowded on all steam possible and the
unconscious men were hurried to the
Williamstown end of the tunnel. Help
was at once summoned here and the
men taken to the surfaqe, where a
corps of physicians made every effort
to resuscitate them, but aid came too
late to Foreman Golden and the other
victims. r

LOS ANGELES, May 25.â An illiter

child whose existence is denied, was
arrested in this city to-day for an al

Mont., millionaire, who, she says. Is
the father 'of the child. Her name is
variously Bessie Driscoll or Mrs. Stcme.
She has already been paid $10,000 by
Dr. O. B. Whitford, the rich old doctor
of Butte, as "hush money." She is
clamoring for $15,000 more, under
threat of sending the baby to his wife.
Hence her arrest.
Detectives who have been shadowing
her here claim that she is only the
tool of a mysterious male blackmailer;
i that he has greedily taken her 510.000,
only giving her a miserable pittance to
live on, dribbling it out to her in small
amounts. Although she writes to the
old millionaire fascinating descriptions
of her baby, "playing about my room
|as' I write, etc.," the detectives claim
that she has no baby and never has
had one.
On the other hand the girl claims
that she Is the victim of this rich old
man, who was her physician,- and who,
she says, took advantage of the con
fidential relations of physicians and
I patient.

"First, that Cardinal Merry Del Val.
not having given an answer, the recall
of the Embassador was not Justified;
second, that the answer which the
Cardinal n-ould have given within an
hour would have been exhaustive and
thoroughly satisfactory, and third, that
the request of M. Nisard to be inform
ed as to the contents of the notes sent
to the other Catholic states was ab
solutely contrary to diplomatic usagp.
and that there was no rule which
obliged the papal government to send
a collective note." â¢ -
The Cardinal said he would reply im
mediately if the Embassador's interro
gations were put in writing. M. Nisard
pointed out that there was no time to
do this and the Cardinal then said that
he would give an answer within an
hour or even within half an hour. AA.
Xisard, however, insisted on immedi
ate reply and pleaded that the Cardinal
should answer "yes" or "no." The lat
ter said he was sorry, that he was un
able to comply with the Embassador's
demands. M. Nisard replied:
"Then I shall telegraph Minister Del
casse that you decline to answer."
M. Nisard then withdrew, saying that
he would write. Two hours later Car
dinal Merry Del Val, not receiving
word from the Embassador, sent a
communication to the embassy saying
that he was at M. Nlsard'a disposal
and prepared to give an answer, but no
reply to this communication was re
ceived.
On Saturday morning M. Nisard
again visited the Secretary of State
and Informed him that the insistence
upon a written form of his questions
had been Interpreted as a desire to
elude the subject and that, the-efore,
he had been instructed to leave Home
on a vacation.
The Osservatore Romano concludes:
Friday last, according to the paper.
11 Nisard visited Cardinal Merry Del
Val and told him he had been Instruct
ed by Foreign Minister DelcasSe to in
quire as to the authenticity of the text
of the note to the Catholic powers as
published In L'Humanlte of Paris,
which varied from that directed to the
French Government, and to ask espe
cially if the phrase regarding the recall
of the Nuncio, which was omitted from
the note addressed to France, really
occurred in that sent to the other
powers.
ROME, May 25.â The Osservatore
Romano, the Vatican organ, publishes
an official statement reviewing the re
lations existing between Cardinal Mer
ry Del Val. the papal Secretary of
State, and Nisard, French Embassadur
to the Vatican, immediately before the
recall of the latter as the result of the
papal protest against President Lou

there is no danger of an epidemic.
Letters received here from Liaoyang
say the conditions there are much im
proved, dry weather prevailing in April
and early in May. Harbin was being
cleaned up. The conditions in "Korea,
on the other hand, are described as ter

ST. PETERSBURG. Â£lay 25.â
There are indications that General
Kuropatkin is preparing to make a
very important move against the
enemy. One of the reasons for this be
lief is the sudden increased restrictions
upon the war correspondents at the
front. The prevailing belief here is
that General Kuroki's army is in diffi
culties.
Emperor Nicholas to-day received the
following telegram from General Kuro
patkin. dated May 25:
"There has been no change in the
general situation in the direction of
FengvÂ»angcheng or the gulf 'of Liao

enemy. It is established that 40,000
Japanese troops have been concen
trated at Fengwangcheng and that
there are four line regiments and fifty
guns at Pianmin.
"The advance of small detachments
of Japanese toward Siuyen has been
observed. It was carried out very slow

"A force of 3000, including Infantry
of the line and guards, and three
squadrons of cavalry, advanced on May
22 along the Siuyen road, on the left
bank of the Tayang River. At the
same time there was a. simultaneous

ternational commerce, evoke much in
â¢ u rest here and are the subject of gen

The indications are that if the ques
tion of laying mines beyond the three

inal protest it will raise a new question
Â¦ of international law. growing out ot

The three-mile limit was established in

north of Takushan on May 20, in which
the Japanese ambushed a sotnia of Cos
sacks and nearly annihilated it.
The Cossacks were patrolling to the
north of Takushan for a distance of
eighteen miles when they fell in with
three squadrons of Japanese cavalry,
who retreated. The Cossacks followed
and fell into an ambuscade, a body of
Japanese infantry being concealed be
hind a small hill.
Commander Beckromesheff ordered
his men to draw their sabers and cut
their way out when his horse was shot
under him. He had Just time to order
the sotnia to scatter when he fell,
wounded.
The Japanese then closed in on two
sides, firing volleys at close range. The
two remaining officers fell and the Cos
sacks retreated with the loss of three
officers and thirty men.

ST. PETERSBURG. May 25. â The
opening of all of the ports of the

and represents a distinct policy insti

effect of closing the former free port

the advisability of reopening it. Action
was hastened by Viceroy Alexieff, who
telegraphed to the Emperor, advising
the immediate adoption of the policy.

Take Pussy From the Well.
Senator Bard has defined his posi
tion in the Senatorial contest with
sufficient clearness to satisfy his sup
porters that he is a candidate for re
election to the Senate. It is clear,
likewise, that Henry T. Oxnard is in
the race for Senatorial honors. Un
less something like a political revolu
tion occurs this year the Legislature
will be safely Republican, and the
contest will therefore be fought to the
finish in the Republican camp.
It is common gossip in party circles
that the Republican legislative defe
gations from the counties south of Te
hachapl will exert a controlling Influ
ence in the choice of a Senator to suc
ceed Mr. Bard, yet there Is Considera
ble activity in the Republican camps
of San Francisco. Oakland. Sacramen
to. San Jose and Stockton.
There is an impression that the
south will present two and perhaps
three Republican candidates to the
Legislature, although pressure will be
brought to unite all the southerners
in favor of the aspirant who may win
a majority in the districts south of Te
hachapi in the November election. The
holdover State Senators must be reck
oned with In all the calculations of the
political managers.
It is now understood by the friends
and supporters of Mr. Oxnard that
Senator Perkins will preserve strict
neutrality, but Senator Bard himself
and many of his supporters expect
something more favorable from the
senior Senator than a declaration that
he will keep hands off.
During the last session of Congress
many of the United States Senators ex
pressed the wish to Senator Bard that
he might succeed himself, and among
those who gave him good cheer and
encouragement was his colleague, Sen
ator Perkins. In the campaign preced
ing the election of a United States Sen
ator in 1903, which culminated in the
choice of Senator Perkins to again
succeed himself. Senator Bard testi
fied to the worth and ability of his col
league.
Politicians remark that Henry T.
Oxnard is displaying considerable* en
ergy and tact as a candidate and may
win the friendship and support of sev
eral of the leading Federal office-hold
ers in this State. It is said that Gov
ernor Pardee and Congressman Met
calf favor the proposition of electing
to the Senate one of the southern asp.l
rants so that Alameda County may not
be embarrassed four years hence in
the selection of a candidate to succeed
Senator Perkins.

A few short words from President
Frank J. Symmes closed the anniver

Judge Hunt's "letters" were often
much applauded, almost every other
line being a palpable hit at some phase
of local politics or a humorous thrust
at^munieipal graft, that called forth
especial commendation.
dee, who regretted his inability to be
present and bespoke the support of th(
association for the National Guard
saying, among other things:
It is necessary that men like these of the
Merchants' Association shall allow nnd en*
courage their employes to become members of
the National Guard and freely give them all
the time required for drills and encampments.
â¢ â¢ You have it in your hands to DUt us

quire (which Ood forbid!) California can fur
nish for the nation's defense a force of brave,
trained, disciplined, well-equipped men. ready
to follow the flag and uphold our nation's
honor. Will you do it?
Judge John Hunt, of the Superior
Court, closed the epeechmaklng by
reading, amidst great laughter, three
humorous/letters purporting 'to come
from "professional men," and to give
their views of the work of the Mer
chants' Association. The first letter
was from "a* professional politician" of
the Bowery type, giving his opinion of
local politics and reformers; another
was from "a professional cynic," and
cleverly satirized the efforts of a mer
chant to evade jury duty; the third
was from "a journalist." and gave the
events of the late war between the
flower dealers and. the Merchants' As
sociation in the form of bulletins from
the "front." Judge Hunt also read a
letter from Richard Mansfield, the cele
brated actor, in which he highly prais
ed San Francisco and the work of the
Merchants' Association.

A letter was read from Governor Par-
eration In dealing with the question:
Involved upon a systematic and prac
tical plan rather than by an emotiona
and spasmodic effort.
Andrew Davis, first vice-president of
the Merchants' Association, read an
interesting: paper on charity reform in
San Francisco and California. He de
clared that the abuses of charity were
breeding grave problems of dependence
and pauperism and' pleaded for co-op-
The voters have accepted these reports as
a safe basis of action, and that they follow
the advice given In their voting is shown by
the fact that out of the seventy present mem

on whoily non-partisan lines and controlled
by honest men. (Applause.)
You know what Maik Twain said: "When
In doubt, tell the truth." It Is a common
place that tho government of American cities
rswrka a failure of democracy. This I be
lieve to be false. Our bad municipal govern
ments arÂ« rather a result of the lack of
democracy. Too many of our cities have been
ruled from State capitals and they have been
badly ruled. ' Given home rule I cannot be
lieve- the nongovernment of American < cities
is permanent. Their cltt*enÂ» are more in
telligent and public spirited, on the whole,
than are the residents of the rural districts
The public sentiment of the cities Is far in
advance, of that of thÂ« country at large. But
the light (s turned on the city and scandals
there are published broadcast. Then the bat
tles there are fiercer than in the country, be
cause the great prizes by which the public
service corporations can pay for corrupt action
arc far beyond any other temptation. But
we are waking up and a better public sÂ«ntl
mtnt is everywhere taking hold of municipal
rrcblems.
One sign of this Is the Chicago Voters'
Ix-ague. We have been modest In our alms
and have confined our work to trying to get
a clean City Council. A few years ago the
Ctuncil was rotten, fifty-eight out of the
sixty 'members combining to put through every
Job. that had any money In it for the "gans."
But after hard and practical work conditions
have chanced.
At present our method Is to watch every
member of the Council and collect data also
regarding every man who wants to become a
member. We found two things to be done
in cleaning out the Councilâ first, to over
come the fetich of partisanship, and second,
t*> get before the voters accurate Information
which they would accept. So we issue each
ye^r two reports. One gives the record of
thÂ«? men in office. This is published some time
before the election. The second report, pub
lUhed onlv a week or two before election day,
gives the best obtainable information, gath
ered frcm all possible sources and carefully
verified, regarding every candidate, whether
he be a member of the Council already or a
new man.
CJeorgre C. Sikes of Chicago, the sec
retary of the Municipal Voters* Leamie
of that city, was then Introduced to
answer the toast, "The View of the
Visitor." By request of President
Symines. however, he devoted most of
his time to an account of the work of
the Chicago organization of which he
is an officer. He said in part:
SUCCESS IX CHICAGO.
Now the question naturally comes, how are
we going to do thin? What would be the re
sult of sucb a system aside from the safety?
There naturally wnuid follow a reduction In
Insurance. One of our citizens recently ; re
ceived a letter from one of the consulting en-
Klneers of rhlladulphia, who states positively
thsit In that city the underwriters have re
duced the fire Insurance rates iI5 cents on each
$llio, or a quarter of 1 per cent, since the In
troduction of the high pressure system. As
opposed to this In Eastern cities where they
are not provided with high pressure systems,
as In Baltimore, they are lncrenslng rate*.
The city of Han Francisco pays $100.0(k> per
annum for the water supply, and even
though they pay that the water company re
fuses to put In more hydrants or rearrange
the mains Â«o an to make It positively and ar>-
BJlutt-ly safe without uddltlonal cost. We may
aÂ» well apply thia toward an independent sys
tem. The 32,OUO,<XK> gallons of water now
uued by the Fire Department could be used
for garden* lawns Â»nd beautifying the city.
And It would not be necessary to be served
Â¦with three or four notices a week Instructing
patrons not to use the water because of Hb
scarcity.
Had Chicago or Baltimore had a system ar
ranged like tils their fires would never have
occurred. In Chicago, when the conflagration
wiped out the. wnter works the city waa en
tirely at the mercy of the tlames. In our
cane no fire cceld destroy our supply or burn
thu ricervolr, there would be no enirltip to
bveak down and the means of extinguishing
aÂ» great u. conflagration as has ever been
known to the world could be ours. Did we
need more wuter we could then start the pumps,
and they would be adequate to supplying any
amount needed under ordinary or even extra
ordinary circumstances, and should that not
be sufficient the system could be connected
with some of the reservoirs of the Hprlnt? Vail
ley. and we would then have available all
possible resources.
tern are Xew York, Boston, Buffalo and Phil
adelphia.
Kvery house could be supplied witn .salt
water by means of a reducing valve, and It
would not be necetwary In order to connect
with the main to shut off the supply. The
department could use one of those recently
Invented machines which is strapped onto the
main and which works in such a manner as
to first make the hole In the pipe, then turn-
Inr around It taps the hole, turning it a lit
tle more, and the pipe can be 6crewed Into the
main and the machine can then be taken off
and the connection la complete. On this put a
reducing valve and if only five pounds pres
sure of ealt water is wonted In the houne
It could be had. even though the main pipe
had 3U0.U00 pounds pressure to the square
Inch. Toilets and house sewers â¢ could be
flushed.
The flushing of the street sewers in the city
of San Kranclsco Is a very Important item. The
fact that we have hills ajjd valleys, the fact
t ui i: A> '' ave " dry and a wet season, makes
this of Kreater Importance than any other
city, except it be altuated Identically the same.
Nature haÂ» prodded wisely and wonderfully
uf. San Francisco. It has not only Klven her
hills nnd vulleys, the ocean and the bay and
all that la to be desired In- natural beauties
and environments, but In the summer time,
when the newer* are dry, when the water In
the cesspools at the majority of the street cor-',
neraj has evaporated and the deadly sewer
gases arise to the , hUhest point, when the
sewer gases are emitted to an alarming extent,
then nature comes In, knowing that In all
probability we would not have sense enough
to take care of ourÂ«elvÂ«H, and she brings the
trade winds ond carries this sewer gas heaven
wa Â«1 ut * n ' 1 * ' a no reason why we should
not heli> nature. The salt-water fire system
wou |d K've ui no antiseptic solution and we
could pour this into the sewers and keep them
absolutely clean and freah. The pressure of
salt water may also be used for washing our

TRADE USGiSULTlOS DESIRED.
"The View of the Merchant" was the
next aspect In which the work of the
Merchants' Association was discussed.
This was assigned to Joseph A. Stulz,
president of the Retail Grocers' Asso
ciation, who said:

I influence is at the servlcv of the Merchants
a.- -.Â¦ 1. ill. .11 whenrver.lt may be weeded, si>
that It muy be coneidTed as really one more
unet of this ipfondld organization.
\VÂ«> expect to demand several laws from
the next t*gl*lature. One of these Is A law
t.- nmke the hu*hand and wife Individually
lUlile .'or the family e*|wnses. Huctra law is
on the Matute U>oks of Illinois and several
othi-r KtatÂ«^ and causes no evil results, while
the prexetu law In Californiu Is very unfair.
Open accounts outlaw in California in two
ytrhi*. In only one other State, Texas. Is
tfÂ«re so unjuft a law. , In fifteen States the
time iÂ» thiee yeurs. In twenty states six years
â¢i-vrtt States liave four yearu, five Stales havo
fi\c yeais and In Wyoming accounts live eight
jears. For myself I cannot understand why
a bill for necessaries of life vhould ever out
law. We shall probably ask that the time
bÂ« extended to four years.
We wÂ»nt a law that will allow the forma
tion on safe lines of mutual fire insurance
c. ntpa nifs such as have bt-en saving from
30 ti> CO per cent of tho cost of th.-lr insurance
t.t the merchants in various Eastern Stati-s.
We want a law such as they have In Germany,
whrre dishonest advertising is treated^ as ob
taininK money um!er talse preteniMR.
I think that not only the consumeâ¢ but
the remil dealers, mamitactuicrs and the en
tire Ktate of California, would be benefited
by the creation of a pure food commission,
whose duty thould be the enforcement of our
present lawn ugainst adulteration of food. In
our effortu to secure UNH laws we look to
(he Metchantd" AFSiK-iation of Sun Francisco
for tympathy and active assistance, and 1
feel sure ihut we fchall not be di^ippu'Â»' t 'd.
It 1-t-ets with orBanirations like the Mer
chants' Association and Grin-ers' Association
to educate the retailers to the fact that men
are not hated and shunned because they re
fuse to tiutimit to abuse, but are rather ad
nilred and respected. While th? Merchants 1
A -.- .. i.iii'.;x has already accomplished splen
did results in the material improvement of
Hun Francisco, we ail look for even greater
results In the future. In my opinion the
preatest b<H>n It has bestowed Is tha educa
tion, the awakening, of the retail merchant
class tn thÂ« jR>ssibilitles of united effort.
What the ultimate results of this will bÂ« I am
rot a good enough prophet to foretell. As a
retail merchant there are some things that 1
ferl an possible and that I hope will be
brought ;Â¦.!'Â¦ -ui by this organization. Among
them aie llie following:
Firstâ An effeotUe and businesslike civil
tit lea system to better our city government.
Secondâ Thoroughly paved streets and a
complete WWCT system.
Thirdâ Concerted action of merchants to
BUiÂ«-rvlse various advertising schemes and
suppress by common action those that are
useless and vicious.
Fourthâ As a merchant from the North
Knd, I am able to speak authoritatively of
the need of a beautiful Telegraph Hill.
Fifthâ Common action that will secure
equitable legislation for retail merchants gen
erally.
FOR BETTER FIRE 1MIOTECTIOX.
It was characteristic of the associa
tion and its spirit that the longest
speech of the evening and one that ev
ery member listened to with the clos
est attention should deal with a RUh-
Ject of practicaTand immediate import
ance to the city. "The View, of the
Property Holder" was the subject of
lÂ»r. Hartland Law's address, and he
argued at length and with great force
for an auxiliary fire protection system
to furnish sea water from reservoirs
at Twin Peaks and lower levels. Dr.
I^au's points were frequently punctua
ted with applause. The substance of
his address is here given:
While we speak of sewers, well -paved
streets, clean streets, more beautiful but.
poundings, ihe adorning of our streets and
(â¢arks with artistic creations and the con
nructlon of better bulldinjts, the need that
â¢Â¦.:.:: ii-.Ts us now is an auxiliary water system
'or thÂ« Fire Department. San Francisco has
tÂ» advantages and db-advantag^s. Anvnig the
lltadvantages In cas* of fire are the large
lumber of wooden buildings, the steep long
ulls, the lack of engines in near-by towns,
.: .1 i:nM of all the inability to get the water
ft'hich we have stored itt sufficient quantities
.nd at the Drouer time. When the water
iystem supplying the city of San FrancUco
*as oriiclnally 1 Ian: -1. the growth and ultl
nate slz* of the city could not be compre
hended. Capitalists from the Kast agree that
?an Francisco offers the best opiicrtunlty for
Erowth and development and increase of in
. estments. WhlU- they consider very sori
iusly the manufacturing possibilities and the
â¢.'-..-!â¢.â¢- rvowth on one banj, thÂ« safely of
;uilding Is considered on the otlver. and be it
Â¦lid to our shume that with the present water
iupply the city's safety !.- nil In i-ase of a
*\orv conflagration.
Pome time &go the representative* of the
vater company Informed a committee of the
Juard of Supervisors that the mains were aJe
luate to suiiply water for domestic purports
md that tht> were uuwilliiiK either tt> adÂ«l
tydrants or change the nlze of the mains
tecesnary to make the water euuply for flrc*
easonably sure unless some provision was
nade to them by the cltv.
A GRAVE SITTATIOX.
The Â«eriouÂ»ine*s of the â¢ituatlon is not real
red by business men. There is no man in this
ludU-nce to-nluht who would dare run hU
msineks as Â¦ ,.>c r the brink as this city is
Â¦â¢- :.i.>" *o far as a conftatrratlon Is concerned.
rÂ»kÂ»\ for Instance. Pine street, in the board
ug.house district, where sx> much opposition
eccstty developed aÂ«a lr.st extending the fire
imita to that street. It was found that Pine
trcÂ«?t has onlv a six- Inch main. If a con-
UKra.lk>n were to start ti>-niK*it while we sit
tore, at tte corner of Jones and Pine streets,
here would not be enough water in the mains
o nupi-ly half the engines that would be called
ut on the first call. Not more than two could
:tt the water supply on that street, and If the
i-ind were blowing that whole section from
ones and Pine east over the hill into the busl
iet.s district would bÂ» at the mercy of the
tames, la some section* there are only four
â¢:â¢ '1 mains and on some streets, where there
re many building? containing inflammable
naterial, there are no mains at all.
We arc face to face with this matter. When
he lialdwin fire tvx>k iHace there were some
wenty-sevt-n engines at that fire, and there
ta<Â« absolutely no pmsure In the mains. The
ijdrant In the basement of the Columbia
["heater, across the street, would not give
rater; a hydraulic- elevator several bhjeks
iÂ»ay would not ruist.. In other words. ' it
n-aul Just thlÂ»: there was not enough water
o feed the mains coming to that fire, and that
Ire was in a most favorable part of the. town.
is It couid be surrounded on three sides.
'(!Â«.']!, Market and Ellis streets. There was
\\> could have at the Palace Hotel twenty
lines Of hose and it would throw water over
the top of the Palace Hotel Into the court
and make an aquarium out of that court In
a very short time. Twenty streams In twenty
four hours at that pressure and at that posi
tion would only use 20,000,000 gallons of
water and would still leave In the reservoir
several million gallons to le Oaod for sny
subsequent fire, with pressure m .'Â«h 14 ever
come another fire in any part of the city. The
cities that are using this high pressure ays-
Our situation in Ideal. No city has the
lulvantnges of a high pressure water system
conducted on the gravity plan. Whether It
le decided to nee salt water or fresh pro
cured In any way that we may, the Inde
pendent gravity nyiitem Is an Ideal one. It
la economical to build and to operate â Inde
pendent of corporation or clique â under con
trol of the F*ire Department, and gives every
atom of safety possible. With the reeervoira
on Twin IVaks and adequate pumps, we could
fill the reservoirs and then rest. It would be
Decenary to run this pump but a very small
portion of the time, and hence the cost of
maintenance for such a system would be little.
It would he most wise 10 begin this plan In
a small way. establish the enswUlal* and
then as the city grew from year to year ex
tend the pipes and the hydrants. That would
I* the natural way to do It at the beginning.
1-i-t us lay out a plan that would be adequate
In years to come.
In order tf> rive you some Idea of what this
supply of water would do, I may say to you
that at the iial lÂ«ln Are only two million
gallons of water were used: This plan would
Kivt- ten times as much water as was used
at the It.tldutn fire, and It would be used
in tin hours if necessary. It iÂ» the amount
of water at the l*gltinlng of the fire that
count*. As to the pressure, the pressure at
The Call building would be over 300 pounds
to the sqvmre Inch and twenty streams could
easily be thrown over The Call bull. ling. The
water would run nearly C00 feet without en
gines. In Philadelphia recently they or
ganized a high pressure system which la sup
plied by gas engine pumps. There they are
at>l.' to throw water over a twenty-story
building easily with this system, but the^e
engines stopped during the test.
MAKE AQUAHIUM OF PALACE.
In a tire in NÂ»-w York recently the Fire De
partment was unable to cope with the con
ditions present. Their atreama of water would
not rise more than two or three stories. It was
adjacent to the liver, 00 the flreboat was
brought there, and in a little time the fire
whs extlnguixheil with the rait water, showing
that salt water is more effective in its ex
tinguishing qualities than the fresh water.
All experiments eliyw the gtmÂ« results. Pipes
last as long (If pVoperly prepared) as other
!<iprs. In Hoston pipes which had been in use
lor years were dug up and found to be In good
condition.
Well mull nupoKeiblt', then, would be any
Kin h conflagration as occurred in Baltimore
or Toronto if we had such a high pressure
nj'Ftem, because the amount of water that
could be put on any fire in a short time would
absolutely drown the fire and everything about
It. There would be no necessity for steamern â
li< Â¦Â»Â«â¢ could be attached directly to the hydrants.
We are between the fire, devil and the deep
blue soa ond. of the two. we had better take
the drep blue sea. We can use that. All we
liava to do Is to put a pumping plant down
on On braeh, run a pipe up Avenue 11 to
H'.anyan xtrett and from Stanyan Htreet
to tie top of Twin Peaks. There,
there ib a flat made for the pump, and by
excavating twenty feet deep . we can get a
reservoir of ruck caoable of holding 20, (MM), 0<)0
gallons of wuter. From there It could be con
ducted down the Clarendon Heights Into an
â¢other low prrasure tank holding 500,000 gal
lons, ond from there down Seventeenth to
Market, where straight lines of pipe can be
laid to the ferry. Laterals can be laid to
1 the north and to the south and the city grid-
Ironr-d east and weÂ«t. We can have the finest
water supply for the Fire Department that
exista In any country in the world. There Is
no position' cqiiHl to It.
Till-: DEEP BLUE' SEA.
That is the poeltlon that you and your busi
ngs and your property are In to-nlRht. Or
dinary firt-M ran be handled, extraordinary fires
i iiniii.i lie handled, and the water company,
on a business preposition, should not be asked

David J. Kelly, the man who made
the accusation, was called to the stand
and testified in part as follows:
When I got to the corner of Rondel place
and Sixteenth street Mr. Gunther came from
the opposite side of the streetâ we call It
"street"; It is called Rondel place â Gunther
came from the opposite side of the small
etreet and sayc: "Hello, Kelly," took my
hand and shook- It, and by that time I think
I had sot about eight or nine feet from the
eornor of Sixteenth street on my way home.
We fctood by the house â the sidewalk Is very
narrow and we stcod by the house and he saya:
"Look here, Kelly, you are In that Chinese
Â»-as.e. ain't you?" "Some China case," I Â«ays.
lie says: "Iv-ok here: I am interested in that
ran" and I want you to help mo out. I am
getting a fee." he cays, "and I am willing to
divide the fee with you." I was almost dum
fourded and looked down at- the sidewalk and
didn't say a word. "Well." he says, "what
is the use of - them Chinamen? You cannot
believe, either one of them," he nays. "They
will He and they will franible anywhere, no
matter what you do." He nays: "You can
not believe tl.Â«m: why can't you make a. little
Jurt as well as I," he nays. "It will be all
rljrht. and nobody will be any the wiser of It.
Y^u know me." he sayi, "and I know you;
why can you not help a fellow out?" He says:
â¢â¢IJ*re, I will tell you -what I will do; I will
give you a hundred dollars If you hang that
I don't know what my rights are at this in
vestigntlon. I can only say I am not repre
sented by counsel at all. I am dumfounded at
anything of this kind, and I thinkâ I don't
know whether I have any right to be repre
uenteri In- this particular examination by coun
sel â if I am I would like to have some counsel
here.
At that juncture of the testimony
the court asked Gunther if he wished
to ask any questions. Gunther re
plied: Â»
Edward W. Gunther, law and col
lection agent, is under arrest on a
charge of attempted bribery of a juror
in the case of Nguen Lun, a Chinaman
who is on trial for his life for the
murder of Tom YIck, a member of the
Chinese Educational Society. The
murder was committed May 8, 1903,
in Ross alley and Nguen Lun waa
picked out by the police as the in
dividual who fired the fatal shot. The
case has been on trial for three weeks
in Judge Lawlor's court, and it was
expected that it would terminate yes
terday. It did, but not in the manner
contemplated.
When the case was called yesterday
morning Attorney Hiram Johnson,
who has been conducting the defense,
asked the court to discharge the jury
on account of certain information
which had come to his knowledge.
Judge Lawlor, who had been told of
the facts, asked for information as to
why such a request should be granted.
In compliance with that desire De
tective Thomas L. Ryan was called to
the stand and told the story of how
Juror David J. Kelly of 18 Rondel
place had called him up on the 'phone
Tuesday night and later came to his
house and stated that E. W. Gunther
had placed $150 in his coat pocket,
with the remark that Kelly should
hang the jury. Ryan testified that he
at once reported the matter to Captain
Martin and then made an arrange
ment with Kelly to meet him at the
tiall of Justice in the morning and tell
his story to the court and the District
Attorney. During the conversation
that night Kelly wanted Ryan to take
tHe money which he said Gunther had
slipped into his pocket, but Ryan re
fused to accept it, claiming that the
coin should be turned over to the
court in the morning.
While Kelly was telling Ryan of the
attempted bribery he stated that he
had kept Gunther engaged in con
versation in hopes that some one
would come along who would be able
to substantiate the fact that he and
Gunther had been in conversation at
the time he stated. Such a person did
appear on the scene. John Mermer, a
neighbor of Kelly's, saw them together
and Kelly cited that fact to Detective
Ryan.
GUNTHER IS DUMFOUNDED.
Another point the police consider as
against Gunther is that his books show
that he has been acting as a collecting
agent. for a number of Chinese and in
consequence thereof he would be close
enough with them to warrant trusting
him with such a delicate mission.
Kelly said yesterday when he be
came aware of the scheme he decided
to delay the conversation on the street
corner as much as possible in the hope
of some friend or neighbor passing by
who might later testify to having seen
Gunther talking to him.
John Mermer, a neighbor of Kelly's,
passed the two men at about 6 o'clock,
but says that he is not sure whether
he could identify Gunther. Kelly called
at Mermer's house early yesterday
morning, but as the latter was not at
home he left word that he would like
to see Mermer on important business.
Mermer said last night: "I am not
sure whether I could identify the man
as I do not even know whether he wore
a mustache or a beard."
Later in " the evening Mermer called
at police headquarters and identified
Gunther as the man he saw in conver
sation with Kelly.
Prior to being taken to the city
prison Gunther, was allowed to visit his
office to arrange his affairs pending the
securing of bail. "When searched 'at
the prison a card bearing the name of
Wong Fong was found in his pocket,
and as the writing waa of recent date
the police are of the opinion that they
have the name of the man who fur
nished the coin and arranged for the
services of Gunther. Wong Fong, who
resides at 33 Waverly place, or at least
gives his address there, is the same in
dividual who was accused of attempt
ing to bribe the jury in the Quohg
Quock Wah trial for murder. In that
case Wong Fong claimed that he had
fixed the jury, but later it was found
that the verdict desired would not be
rendered, and as a result the money
had been returned to him. When
questioned by the officers of the See
Yup society as to what had become of
the coin he admitted having spent it
for his own use.
The- remaining eleven Jurors wers
then interrogated by the court as to
whether any person had approached
them in regard to the case outside of
the courtroom and all having answered
in the negative, they were discharged
from further consideration of the case.
After the jury had been discharged,
the court said:
With respect to the subject matter of this
investigation the authorities of the city and
county will take such steps as will be appro
priate In order to have this matter probed
to the bottom. This court Is eitremely solic
itous that no effort shall be spared to get at
the truth of this accusation, and If any per
son lias attempted In any manner to interfere
with the due administration of Justice it
will be the duty of all concerned to see that
the law Is vindicated. And If such practices
have been Indulged In this community they
Bhould be made to crease. This can be ac
complished by allowing the heavy hand ot the
law to fall upon such malefactors. Let E. W.
Gunther be taken Into custody.
JURY IS DISCHARGED.
Mr. Johnson â I want to say that my services
are at the disposition of this court or the
District Attorney In this matter or anything
connected with It.
The Court â The court waa about to make
the statement that It shares the confidence In
Mr. Johnson"* conduct throughout that has
been expressed by the prosecution. The court
has a high estimate of Mr. Johneon as a prac
titioner at the bar and. having such estimate
ar.d a favorable opinion of his character and
of his professional ethics, desired to have him
present et all times- when this matter was
under Investigation.
I know nothing nr-~ it him otherwise.
Mr. Ferral â 'We are very certain he waa not
connected with the People.
Mr. . Barrettâ Mr. Johnson has been co-op
erating with us to ferret out this matter and
has led in the suggestion to have the Jury
dismissed.
A number of questions were asked
Gunther relative to his conversation
with Kelly and as to what "he was do
ing in that neighborhood at that time
in the evening. In reply to the last
query he said he had been collecting,
but when asked if he could give the
names of any of the people whom he
had visited, replied: "I guess I could
if. I wanted to. I don't know as I
want to go into the matter. I am not
Mr. Gunther â I think maybe as quick â until
I have collected my thoughts and know just
what to say so as to express them that I
possibly had better leave the matter remain
In the position It Is. The only thing I can
say Is that what Mr. Kelly says Is not so.
The Courtâ If you desire to make a state
ment you will be afforded the. amplest oppor
tunity to do so.
At the conclusion of Kelly's testi
mony the gold coin which he said Gun-^
ther had given him for the purpose of
hanging the jury was taken by the
court, marked and will be used as evi
dence when the case comes to trial.
Gunther was again asked if he de
sired to interrogate the witness, but
said:
I don't know aÂ« I flo. I am not enough
advised. I find myeelf here before the court
and everybody h"e In a very serious plight.
I appreciate that. I have been In the law
business long enough to know that. The whole
matter has taken me by surprise and I am
not in a condition â I am not in a condition
of feeline In- view of such a charge as this
to make any utterance except â I don't know
just what to cay. I know Mr. Kelly, as he
said.
Being unable to get Judge Lawlor
over the phone or at his house without
giving the man, apparently on guard,
the tip that he was about to notify the
court of the offer that had been made
to him, Kelly went to the City Hall
police station and telephoned to Ryan,
and later- saw him at home as has
been stated.
Â¦Whep. I saw that. I said: ' Â¦Jerusalem! are
thÂ»y Fpottlnjj me or something?" So when I
paw the man standing on the sidewalk I
walked rapidly past and paid no attention to It.
This man. whoever It way, followed me for
two or three blocks â I don't know where â he
followed me to the corner â that street that the
cars run down that pass the City Hall.
Jury." I said: "Gunther, they would put mÂ«
In San Quentin for life If I did anything like
that." He says: "Who Is going to know It
but yen and IV I am just as bad as you are:
I am the fellow giving 1 the money." I looked
dov.n and didn't say anything. He says:
â¢â¢Here: I wiil tell you what I will do; I will
make It n iiur.drtd and fifty dollars," and with
-.ha'. h<Â» 'Jroppcl the money In my pocket and
Â¦walkf-U oft. and when he got about ten feet he
turiipd around ami fays: "Now, you stay all
right," 01 words to that effect â "you Ftay with
it." He walked oft and that was the last tl
saw of him.
KELLY SEES MAN ON GUARD.
Kelly recited his troubles with the
telephone and his inability to get any
satisfaction from the line and how he
had gone down the street to Judge
Lawlor's house with the intention ' of
telling: the Judge what had occurred
when he found a stranger standing in
front of the dwelling. Kelly said:

From then on in the proceedings

tions.
COMPLIMENT MR. JOHNSON.
Attorney Hiram Johnson, who has
conducted the defense of Nguen Lun,
out of which case the charge of brib
ery has grown, , desired to be sworn,
but that request was not complied
with. Mr. Barrett said:
Before Mr. Jolinson Is sworn I want to say
on behalf of everybody connected with the
.prosecution, the District Attorney's office. Mr.
Carpenter knd myself, that .there Is not a
shadow of suspicion of any kind attaches to
Sir Johnson. We have been familiar with his
whole conduot In this case and there is not
& shadow of suspicion of any kind against
him. We know him to be beyond. all that kind
of thing and know that when ChinesÂ© do these
things they go behind their counsel.
Mr. Johnson â Well, I think that Is very
kind Mr. Barrett.
Mr. Ferral â I can Indorse ererythlng- Mr.
Barrett has said. â¢
Mr Johnson â The only thing I wanted to
say was that I have listened to what baa
been said about this man being connected with'
the case, and I want to say that In no way,
fchape form or manner has he been connected
with this ca?e. I never saw him before I saw
him Just now and I do. not know him.
Mr. Gunther â That is correct. I don't know

Special Dispatch to The Call
SALT LAKE, May 25. â Twice with
in the shadow of the gallows, then a
prospector and now a mining mag
nate, "Diamondfleld Jack" Davis now
has taken unto himself a bride. Ac
cording to advices received from Ton
opah, Mrs. Minnie Williams of that
city has become his wife.
"Diamondfleld Jack" ' Davis was
tried for and convicted of the murder
of a sheep herder in the Snake River
region of Idaho in the later '90's.
The tragedy was the outcome of a
bitter quarrel between the sheepmen
and cattlemen. Evidence pointed
strongly to "Diamondfield Jack" and
information was immediately filed
against him. In the trial that fol
lowed the State was backed up by the
big sheep owners of Idaho, Nevada
and Utah, F. J. Hagengarth being
among those who assisted financially
in the prosecution. T,be Sparks-Har
rell Cattle Company, of which John
Sparks, now Governor of Nevada, was
senior partner, spent thousands of
dollars toward the defense. Davis
was in their employ at the time of the
murder.
The cattlemen lined up solid be
hind the accused man. The legal bat
tle that preceded "Diamondfield
Jack's" conviction was one of great
bitterness. Judge O. W. Powers was
foremost in the counsel assisting the
State. The jury found the accused
man guilty as charged and he was
sentenced to be hanged.
An appeal was taken. Davis was
again sentenced to death. Then came
intercessions in his behalf. Finally
Davis was pardoned by Governor
Hunt. After he had been freed "Dia
mondfield Jack" prospected in difffer
ent parts of Nevada and finally, at
tracted by the Tonopah stories, locat
ed a claim in that vicinity. Thence he
went to Goldfleld. . A property in
which he was heavily interested af
terward turned out to be rich. It was
the first great mine of Goldfleld and
the discovery was one of the causes of
the rush to that camp. Now "Dia
mondfleld Jack" once a cowboy, next
a doomed convict, then a poor pros
pector, is a mining magnate and a
happy husband.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, May 25.â The high wind
that prevailed yesterday- and to-day
has caused heavy Â¦ loss to the fruit
growers of Santa Clara Valley. The
wind yesterday blew from the south
and reached a velocity or twenty-one
miles an hour. Cherries and prunes
suffered the most, but ally kinds of
fruits were damaged. In some places
fruit trees were blown down. It is es
timated that more than one-half of
the ripening cherry crop Is destroyed,
and that from 20,000.000 to 30,000,000
pounds of prunes have been blown to
the ground. 1
The first car of cherries for the East
left San Jose yesterday and it was
expected to ship from five 10 ten more
this week, but the storm of yesterday
caused such loss that not more than
two cars will go forward now. Much
of the loss of the cherry crop will fall
upon the packers, as most of the grow
ers sell their crops on the trees. In
the Willow district the loss to the
cherry crop is the largest and in sev
eral orchards the ground is covered
with red and black frujt. In one or
chard it is estimated that five tons of
cherries are on the ground. The Black
Tartarians suffered the neaviest, as
they are just in the ripening stage.
Considerable of the cherries left on the
trees are so bruised as to render them
unfit for shipment.
The prune crop also suffered severely.
It is safe to say that 20 per cent of
the fruit is destroyed. B. "Betts, a
Campbell grower, picked up seven
pounds of prunes from under one tree
in his orchard and his estimate is that
20 per cent of his crop is destroyed. All
throughout the valley there was great
damage done to the prunes and the loss
in the entire valley may exceed 20 per
cent.
Peaches and apricots damaged
to some extent.
. In one orchard near Campbell twen
ty-eight fruit trees were blown down
and scores of y-ees are down in other
orchards along the roads.
Many growers believe the destruction
of the prune crop may work to- an ad
vantage to the orchardists. It will give
a chance to work off the hold-over
crop and raise the price of this sea
son's dried fruit.
BAKERSFIELD, May 25.â Several
heavy showers have fallen here since
6 o'clock this evening. The wind is
blowing heavily from the northwest.
If. the rain continues the fruit crop
will be damaged and the farmers will
suffer, as nearly all the hay is down.
The rain is a great relief after the ex
tremely hot days this week. The dust
has been laid and the air purified.

Governor George C. Pardee was in
troduced, being welcomed with much
cheering. The Governor, at the outset,
reverted to a mass meeting he, as a boy
in 1S68, had attended in Oakland, then
a town of only 3000 population. He said:
The national Government by wise and lib
eral appropriation is imikliyr a great harbor
for the city of Oakland. In helping to make
Oakland a great commercial port, remember
that the bay of San Francisco Is the best
fortified port In the United States. New York
not exceptf-d. Our fortincetions are perfect,
and this its the way to insure peace â to be
forMfled against war. Oakland, .with her best
of schools, best homes, churches and libraries,
with a flne harbor, has a magnificent future.
BAY IS THE KEY.
spoke to the theme "The Interest of
the National Government in Oakland."
Senator Perkins said:"
I /eel elated that I am privileged to be a
member of the Oakland Board of Trade, be.
cause it is an organisation that is working
for Oakland. Oakland is eharlng In that which
the national Government Is doing for the whole
Pacific Coast. Our shores are the great right
hand of the nation. The great motto of Cali
fornia. "FJurcka," should be the sign manual
of Oakland.. Alameda County has 740 squate
miles. All of Rhode Island- has only 1250
square miles, yet there are more possibilities
of wealth a. id development in Alameda County
alone than in all of Rhode Island. And when
we think of California with 13Â«,000 square
miles we cannot conceive what is our heritage.
The other speakers and toasts were:
"The Best Government for Oakland,"
City Councilman A. H. Elliott; "The
Relation of the Press to Greater Oak
land." Joseph E. Baker; "The Interest
of the Merchants' Exchange in Oak
land," A. Jonas; '"Is There a Place for

The only absentee in the list of in
vited guests was Thomas Rickard,
Mayor of Berkeley, whose regrets an
nounced an illness which prevented
his attendance. Two interesting in
terpolations to the lengthy programme
lent pleasant color to the unusually
successful gathering. First was the
presentation of a chest of'magnificent
table silver to Edwin Stearns, the in
defatigable secretary of the Board of
Trade; second was the launching of a
$500,000 tourist hotel project by C. H.
King, the East Oakland capitalist. He
announced that the hotel committee
of the Board of Trade had secured an
option on the block of land bounded
by Jackson, Madison, Twelfth and
Thirteenth streets and he started the
subscription list for stock with $10,000.

In his welcome to the 300 guests at
the table President Capwell presented
Toastmaster Snook, who said the feast
was strictly an Oakland affair. Fol
lowing canie President Capwell, who
gave eloquent expression to the pur
poses of the Board of Trade, saying:
OAKLAND, May 25.â Oakland,
spelled In capitals, was the keynote
to-night of a splendid outpouring of
men distinguished in national, State
and municipal affairs, who gathered at
the annual banquet of the Oakland
Board of Trade in Maple Hall. In
point of numbers and enthusiastic in
terest it was one of the most notable
assemblages that has ever been re
corded in the civic history of Oak
land.
Leaders in political life met in touch
with captains of industry, with mer
chants, bankers and capitalists, with
professional men, all imbued with a
hearty, whole-souled desire to ad
vance the interests of the city.
Speeches glowed with a prophecy of
great things for the future and the
efforts of those who have started the
new era along the eastern shores of
the bay were not forgotten. Peculiar
ly noteworthy was the fact that at'the
guest table sat Governor George C.
Pardee, an Oaklander, and United
States Senator George C. Perkins, an
Oaklander. With them were the
president of the Board of Trade, H. C.
Capwell; Charles E. Snook, the toast
master of the evening; the Rev. Wil

OAKLAND, 'May 23.â An effort to ar
rive at a compromise In the suit of
Florence Richards against Harry Rich
ards, the basso and actor, caused the
postponement of the further trial of
the case until next week.
It Is claimed for Richards that he
has such proof of his wife's infidelity
that he can defeat her suit, but that
he does not wish to bring it to light
unless compelled to do so. With this
in view there was a consultation be
tween the attorneys to-day and an ad
journment was then asked for until
next Tuesday. In the mean time it is
believed that a separation without a
divorce will be agreed upon.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
According to the story told by Ben
ton, the woman fell on his doorstep
yesterday aft'ernoon while asking for
money to get to the city. He took her
into his home and sent In a call for
the police patrol. After she had gone
he missed 90 cents he had left on a
mantel and immediately came to the
conclusion she had taken it. The wom
an was searched by the matron when
taken into the hospital, but nothin?
v.-as found in her clothes ana further
search was denied unless he swore to
a warrant charging her with larceny.
She was sent to the County Infirmary
to-day, as she ha? an internal disease
that will probably cause her death.
For SO cents F. Benton to-day would
have had Mrs. Gertrude Howell ar
rested, although she was lying nearly
dead in the Receiving Hospital. He
accused her of\ stealing this amount
from his home at 1053 Fifth avenue
yesterday afternoon and came to the
hospital to-day to demand his jnoney.
There was no evidence that she had
taken the money and his request t.i
have her searched met with a refusal
at the hands of Steward Borchert.

1118 Broadway, May 25.
Hampton admits to the police that
he was drunk at the time the affair
took place, but denies having taken
any rart in the assault with which he
i> charged.
Marshal Kerns is positive in his
statement that Hampton is the thug
who cruelly beat Mrs. Curtis in front
of her own gate. C. R. Maguile is one
of the men who will be summoned as a
witness against Hampton. The assault
was witnessed by several persons who
were passing the Curtis residence at
the time and the peace officers have
now enough evidence, they think, to
secure the conviction of Hampton. Mrs.
Curtis his not yet recovered from the
kicking and pummeling the drunken
brute administered to her.
In Charles W. Hampton the police
think they have the man that brutally
attacked aged Mrs. Mary Curtis in
front of her home at 1123 University
avenue on Sunday evening. Deputy
Marshal Carey arrested Hamp
ton yesterday for drunkenness and to
day Marshal Kerns placed an addition
al "charge of battery against him be
cause he is believed to be Mrs. Curtis 1
assailant. Hampton is an old offender
and has been twice before arrested for
battery and once for failing to provide
for his wife and little child.

â that is, the sale to any one individual
will be limited to six tickets.
There has been more or leÂ«s specula
tion as to where Maude Adams will go
next for a play in respect to nationali
ties. "The Little Minister" gave her
a Scots girl of a most attractive na
ture, and "Romeo and Juliet" sent her
to Italy as a Shakespearean heroine.
Next came "L'Aiglon." After that came
quality Street." in which an English
girl of the "Cranford" period was
shown. Miss Adams Oegan her pres
ent tour in "The Pretty Sister of Jose,"
in which she impersonated a Spanish
maiden of the mctlern type. The pub
lic, however, will never forget Maude
Adams as the Scots lassie in "The
Littl<v Minister." She will be seen fn
this famous play during her San Fran
cisco engagement.

WE recently had something to say * about the
assaults, and violence that have appeared in the
stablemen's dispute with their employers in this
city. These assaults are of an aggravated nature. A single
victim is selected and watched, as he goes about his busi
ness, and is attacked by a number of men in a manner
that renders successful resistance impossible because of
the numbers that assault him. He is endangered in limb
and life and is usually left lying in the street disabled and
ur.conscious to be taken to a hospital to endure long
suffering from his wounds.
These assaults arc in the eye of the law aggravated
by being committed in cold blood and not as the result
of an altercation and sudden access of temper. They have
all the abhorrent features of lying in wait and stealth that
make aggravated thuggery of the offense. When those
( who commit them are recognized and arrested they enlist
the most arrant perjury to establish an alibi and this is
too often accepted by the Joo complaisant officers of the
law. In court the weak and wounded victim is usually
treated with harshness, asif he were guilty of some of
fense or had outlawed himself by believing, that he is
entitled to the peaceful use of the public streets in 'pur
suing his vocation.
It is an evil that spreads by official toleration. It is
a monstrous condition, for which there can be no pallia
tion nor excuse. Its victims are men who are living and*
working strictly within their legal and constitutional
rights as American citizens. They have broken no law
natural or statutory. The license claimed by their assail
ants is a grave breach of both. If the law cannot be en

MORE VIOLENCE.
Until a year or, two ago the Em
peror of Japan was an enthusiastic
wrestler. He threw out challenge after
challenge to the members of the court
and his council and advisers and de
feated fairly and completely every one
who tried conclusions with him until
he met Count Tetsu, who proved one
too many for him. Since the encoun
ter, although he encourages the sport
in every possible way, he has kept out
of the arena. "Count Tetsu is now
champion." he would say; "I have
failed to throw him! Some one else
must try."
'A Royal Wrestler.
The Board of Education has decided that with the*
next fiscal year teachers in the public schools will receive
an increase in salary.* 1 No better recognition of public
service, well done, could have been made. Instructors
in our public schools are poorly paid even with the in
crease that has been granted. The spirit of the School
Board may be accepted, however, as a precedent for bet
ter things. â¢
A LETTER has been received from one of _ our
,. readers _itating that "The soldiers' graves in the
San Francisco and . Oakland cemeteries suggest
nothing but the care that is given to all other graves"
and that "a very cheap monument of no nobility marks
something or other," but does not designate the location
as being the resting place of a soldier. The letter refers
to the fact that many great works have been accomplished
by the general subscription of but a* penny each and
suggests that the press advocate the collection fof a vol
untary pittance at the cemeteries on Decoration day and
at patriotic exercises or dinners and that such collection
be continued year after year until the amount be sufficient
to mark every soldier's grave with a proper monument.
The suggestion is timely. It is but right to foster
and perpetuate gratitude to those who have forgotten self
even so far as to die that their country might live. The
sacrifice is all the more'complete in that it is usually made
by the young and vigorous, with manhood just com
menced, and it is not just, therefore, that such be soon for
gotten. With the coming of Decoration day, when our
sorrow mingles with admiration for the honored dead 1 it
is well to ponder whether our manifestations of honor
shall be as short lived as the flowers we strew, or whether
some more substantial memorial shall remind the
stranger, of thf ir devotion to country and our de
votion to their memory. , If there be merit in the senti
ment which prompts us to observe Decoration day and
to remember the sacrifices which' were the cause of its
creation, there iÂ« reason to properly and decently mark
the spot made sacred by the bones of the men that made
A SOLDIERS' MONUMENT.
Here's a St. Louis editor's view of
the fair, taken on the spot:
"All the beauty of fancy becomes
reality at the fair by night, when from
frozen music the rare architectural
creation turns to a poem in flre. A
drawing of infinite grace in lines of
myriad lights, the purple heavens
overhead, the fair is a dream in
realization, a picture to madden poets.
Lalla Rookh never saw stained webs
of such beauty as the fabric of light
there. Kubla Kahn's stately pleasure
dome and sacred river and measure
less caverns never achieved such fairy
loveliness. No feast of Cleopatra in
all its "oriental gorgeousness ever at
tained the like. Aladdin's magic lamp
could not produce it. Portia's heavens,
studded with .patines of bright gold, as
seen from her luxurious balcony, were
as ' fireflies to suns compared to the
illuminated vista of light and sky from
the plaza. Milton never dreamed any
thing approaching it In his fairest in
spirations; nor Dante, nor any other
who transcribed the vision of a mind's
eye."
Meanwhile, they are still busy open
ing the packing boxes.
Honeyed Words.
As far as truth may be expected from the scene of
war's operations in the East it appears that one thousand
Japanese soldiers were killed in the initial land effort
to reduce the gigantic fortifications at Port Arthur. A
few more incidents such as this may "possibly convince
the fighting men of the Mikado that war is a desperate
game in which good guns and better gunners count more
than patriotism.
Purple In the face, his jaw wagging
and his eyes bulging from their sock
ets. Captain X went to the bow and
dragged aft the old fashioned, pat
bellied cannon used on rare occasions
for firing signals at sea. When he
had lashed it to the shore side of the
boat he went below to the galley, ap
pearing soon with an assorted armful
of groceries. .
Powder he rammed Into the broad
mouth of his old culverin, then he
shotted it with a can of tomatoes and
a can of condensed cream. Carefully
training the ancient piece upon the
walls of the Swede's place, not fifty
yards distant, he fired. Then he quick
ly charged the cannon again, this time
with more tomatoes and a bottle of
olive oil, wapped in a rag. More con
densed cream, next a bottle of vase
line from the medicine chest. The
bombardment was a thing of rare
beauty.
When the Swede had at last suc
ceeded in digging up the town con
stable the side of his shack looked
like the kind " of crazy quilts that
grandma used to make and Captain
X was rolling on the deck of the Silas
Peters in gales of laughter.

. The valley chosen by the ancient
dwellers on the Septimontium as their
place of burial was a still, marshy,
tranquil place. No trace has been
found of any path leading up the hill,
and yet after burial the relations of
the deceased used to return once a year

the tombs, where they dug Email pits
and poured in roast corn, milk, etc.,
buf* paved roads and wheeled vehicles
were probably not in existence at such
e.n early period.
The cremation tombs are earlier than
thÂ£ graves and the earliest of all is
considered to date from 1300 B. C; the
other are mostly of the eighth and
ninth centuries B. C. In the fifth or
sixth centuries B. C, after the sepul
oretum was abandoned, primitive
houses were built over its Bite: three
Email tumuli, composed f the ashes of
email huts, have been excavated, at a

tombs.
Another really magnificent discovery
Another was that of a little girl, with
three slabs of tufa covering it inclined
Jike'a roof. It also contained vases
Â¦with remains of the funeral feast.
Beads have also been found in the
tombs of blue, black and white glass,

Ivory armlet, bones of a fish called the
cephalus or great mullet, grape seeds,
etc, the last being smaller than those
of our day.
ornaments, weapons, food, etc., which
they contained, some slight knowledge
can now be obtained cf these ancient
people, their mode of burial and also
" to a certain extent their mode of life.
These torr.bs must have been outside
jj the walls of the town" of the people to
"whom they belonged, and fcr that rea
son alone It is certain that they exist
Â¦ cd before the building of the Servian
" Â¦wall and the incorporation of the seven
hills into one city. But apart from this
Ihe mode of burial, form of the tombs,
" vases, ornaments, etc., all prove their
Eti'.l greater antiquity. Both cremation
end inhumation have been employed in
these tombs, twenty-three of which
have been opened. Eleven were of
persons cremated and buried in well
tombs, of which three were adults, the
rest children.
The ashes of those cremated were
.placed in small hut-urns, resembling
the houses in which they had lived.
These small urns were then deposited
In large terra cotta vases and the
whole lowered to the bottom of a well,
about three feet deep, sunk for the
purpose. The well was then filled In
â¢with the ashes of the funeral pyre.
The graves dug for the reception of
. -whole bodies were filled In with th<=
earth out of which they had been cut,
'and the bodies were inclosed in primi
tive oak coffins, formed out of the
trunks of trees, in the shape 'of boats.
The graves contained vases with food
for the deceased on his journey to the
spiritual world. The contents of these
vases have been analyzed and found to
have consisted of meat, fish, milk, wa
ter, honey, beans, grain, perfumes, etc.
In one grave eight vases were found;
in others vases which had been used

many of them dating from the my

B. C. One tomb was that of a little
"boy, containing email brown bones

"carbonized beans, grain and a small
lance, probably a toy.
SCENE OF RECENT IMPORTANT
EXCAVATIONS ON SITE OF THE
KOSIAX FORUM.
NEW YORK at the present moment is occupying a
position among^American commonwealths as anom
alous as it is gratifying. Under 'the sway of Tam
many, when everything is supposed to be "wide open" and
the grafter and the gambler should be flourishing as the
green bay tree, the conscientious efforts of a few of the
city's officials have interposed to make the name of clean
government arid the honor of a clean city two things to
be accounted for in New York. These men are Attorney
Jerome and Police Commissioner McAdoo.
Under the administration of Mayor Low "Jerome began
his strenuous fight against the gilded gamblers. Work
ing against the opposition of some of the most influential
papers and in direct contravention of the unwritten laws
of police graft, Jerome began his series of crusades against
the "parlors" of some of the most noted gamblers in the
country, sending Canfield to Europe on the run and forc
ing many of the smaller fry to take to cover with great
celerity. Under the Tammany administration, synony
mous as that term has always been for police "pro
tection" and the unseeing eye in matters shady, Jerome
has abated not a whit his'former efforts and New York j.s
rapidly becoming, enough, an unhealthy place
for "short card men" and faro bankers.
Police Commissioner McAdoo has proven himself to be
an equally disagreeable customer to .the pool sellers. Only
on Monday last did this vigorous commissioner direct a
raid against the secret poolrooms which resulted in the
entering of three hundred suspected places and the con
fiscating of over a hundred telephones and paraphernalia
for the- recording of racing returns. In scores of places
that were entered after having been raided previously the
gratifying evidences of an entire suspension of business
were forthcoming. McAdoo is forcing the poolrooms to

gamblers.
The remarkably successful efforts of Jerome and Mc-
Adoo in New York, the work that Folk is doing in St.
Louis and Bonaparte in Baltimore all point to the grow
ing power of individual zeal in the matter of municipal
reform. These years have reform parties, so called, been
put in the field, elected in some instances, and failed of the
accomplishment of their purposes in nearly every in
stance. The reform party too often is the party of the
soreheads, whose shibboleth of good government, good
officials, good services serves only to land them into
power and then is straightway forgotten. But such
energy as Jerome and McAdoo are displaying in Tam
many New York, individual energy, the vigorous asser
tion of a personality given to the right, is productive of a
new and a hope inspiring aspect in the problem of muni
cipal government.

First of all Umlauff made a model
in clay, which he used to guide him in
mounting the great beast. To describe
this labor in anything like detail would
be too tedious. Numerous measure
ments had to be taken and the skin
tanned. The real labor in connection
with the mounting was that involved
in building a suitable framework or
"manikin" to receive the skin. To ac
complish this a wooden skeleton was
made and firmly bolted to a stout plat
form. This was padded with excelsior,
on top of which was laid a thick layer
of modeling clay. This latter was a
close copy of the real animal on a
slightly smaller scale, to insure a per
fect, fit of the. huge skin.
The task occupied four months of in
cessant work and is regarded as one of
the greatest taxidermy feats on record.
After the gorilla had been mounted it
was purchased by the Hon. Walter

Illustrated Mail. .
The daring hunter at once took out
his bush knife, and after considerable
trouble managed to cut a path to the
foot of the tree. His curiosity aroused,
the gorilla looked down through the
leaves, but at that moment Paschen's
gun was heard, the huge beast receiv
ing an ugly wound in the jaw. It fell
head first out of Its perch, but caught
hold of the branches before it reached
the bottom. But a second shot, well di
rected, had the desired effect, bringing
the monster to the ground at the very
feet of the slayer. It was not only a
giant, but a magnificent specimen of
its class. The skin was beautiful and
the teeth perfect. Twelve men carried
it back to the village â no easy task,
the monster turning the scale at e v ,out
500 pounds.
After taking a snapshot of the gorilla
Paschen had it skinned. It was subse
quently mounted in Hamburg at J. F.
G. Umlauff's celebrated ethnological
museum by Willy Vmlauff after four
months of incessant work. When in
Hamburg recently the writer paid a
visit to this famous establishment and
was introduced to the man who stuffed
and mounted the finest and largest
specimen of the ape that has ever been
shot.
The largest gorilla ever shot Is to be
seen in England. It finds a resting
place in the Hon. Walter Rothschild's
private museum" at Tring. Incident
ally, too, it Is without question the
finest mounted specimen of the big ape
in Europe.
This giant beast was shot some little
time ago in Central Africa by a Ger
man hunter, H. Paschen. While shoot
ing in Yaunde, in Kamerum, a German
possession in equatorial West Africa,
he was informed by several natives of
Esonutown that a "big monkey" was
in the neighborhood, of which they
appeared in awe*
Paschen subsequently set out to find
the "monkey," accompanied by sev
enty-one natives. After about fifteen
minutes* walk they came to a dense
and swampy thicket, where the natives
said the beast was hidden. At last the
animal was discovered hiding In a tree,
so situated that no one could get at
him.

This story has to do with the some
what fiery temper of old Captain X,
who used to run a little steam schoon
er between this port and Eureka sev
eral years ago.
On one of his trips, his boat
was tied up at the Eureka wharf un
loading. Captain X went ashore to look
through the bottom of several glasses
as was his wont when the weather was
fine and he cared to take careful ob
servation of the meridian before put
ting out frc-m port. In one of the
places where they keep such glasses,
only a stone's throw from where his
good BhiD Silas Peters was docked, the
captain entered into an argument with
the proprietor as to the relative merits
of sulphur and vermicide in the treat
ment of mangy dogs. The argument
waxed warm.' The captain invoked the
ancestors of the proprietor to come
from the nethermost pit and witness
the absolute cussednees of their prog
eny. The proprietor, a Swede and a
man of action, hit Captain X over the
head with a bung-starter and cast him
forth into the cold and cheerless street.
When Captain X clambered aboard
the Silas Peters the stevedores leaned
their heads on their hands In rapt
admiration at his stock of expletives.

EVERY Democratic State platform this year raised
a loud and accusing voice against the expenses of
the Federal Government and the rate of Federal
taxation. At the same time many of those platforms de
mand that the country embark upon government owner
ship and operation of railroads and other public utilities,
adopting the Socialistic policy of New Zealand and Aus
tralia. The statistics do not warrant the complaint about
Federal taxation. For the purposes of the general gov
ernment we are the lightest taxed people on earth.
These statistics show the tax per capita in the different
leading countries and colonies to be:
New Zealand $38 38
Australian Commonwealth 37 69
United Kingdom I 21 39
France 17 84
Belgium 17 40
Paraguay * 17 30
Austria-Hungary . . *.* 14 27
Argentina 12 68
Cuba %. 12 40 -
Netherlands 1149
Portugal 1145
Spain 10 09
Sweden 9 54
German Empire ' 9 45
Canada 9 30
United States ._ Â¦ 7 97
Remember that this is taxation for the purposes of the
general and not the municipal governments. In this
country the rates of municipal taxation are directly con
trolled by the people through their Jocal governments.
Our people are the lightest taxed of any for the purposes
of their general government, while those of New Zealand
and Australia are the heaviest taxed for the same pur
poses.
One does not have to hunt far for the reason of that
heavy taxation. It lies in the adoption of Socialism as the
policy of those governments. They own and run rail
roads, insurance and other business enterprises. They
have laws for the employment of labor by the government
at a statutory wage whether such employment is needed
or not and regardless of any profit to the government.
They have a pension system by which everybody at a
certain age may be supported out of the public treasury.
In prosecuting all of these experiments there is a deficit.
The government railways are run at a loss which is
charged off to the taxpayer. Government insurance does
not pay, its losses are charged to the taxpayer, and so on
to the end of the long list of addlepated experiments.
The final result is the heaviest taxation in the world and
without any resulting benefit. Those governments have
borrowed to the limit of their credit and no one can fore
see anything in their future but a complete collapse of
public and private credit and an explosion of the ill
starred experiments in which dreamers and theorists have
predicted the coining of a social millennium.
Now it is a strange obliquity of view that leads the
Democrats in California and elsewhere to attack the Re
publican policy and rate of Federal taxation when that
rate is the lowest in the world, and at the same time to
demand the installation here of a policy that has made
New Zealand and Australia the heaviest taxed countries
in the world. It proves the careless system by which the
Democratic leaders operate their organization. They
hope only to get votes by impeaching our rate of taxa
tion, probably not knowing what it is or how it compares
with the rates of other countries, and also to get Social
ist votes by advocating experiments which, wherever
tried, have produced a tax rate more than five times
greater than ours.
It is pitiful that the rank and file of a great party
should be led by men who arc reckless of what they
adopt as party principles or favor as party policy. In
Australia and New Zealand the industrial shrinkage has
obsoleted the use of labor so that the opportunity for em
ployment is greatly restricted. Instead of abandoning the
policy that has brought this about those governments are
proposing that the right to be employed at all shall be by
law restricted to the working people who belong to cer
tain organizations, outlawing all others and making it a
penal offense to employ them. This again reacts upon
the taxpaj'ers, who must support the outlawed labor in
pauper establishments and stand the increased cost of
criminal justice which is sure to result from such a
system.
It is all the direct effect of introducing meddling arti
fice into the affairs of men, instead of leaving them to the
operation of natural law under conditions of civil liberty.
Americans who value our institutions will find it incon
sistent with American principles to support the pro
gramme of artifice and Socialism which seems to be the
present purpose of the Democratic party.
has been the foundation stone of the
celebrated equestrian statue to the
Emperor Domitian, raised during the
first century of our era. A great block
of tufa was hoisted and lying under it
were several vases, absolutely pre
served, with the colors as fresh as the
day the vases were made. There is,
however, a very remarkable feature
about the vases. They are archaic,
and belong to the era about 1300 B. C,
and the largest and most beautiful is
chipped at the mouth.
The theoiy is that either they were
precious antiques at the time of Do

vases then existing. This point has not

"WASHINGTON, May 25.â "Within
twenty-two minutes of the retirement
of the jury in the case of James N.
Tyner and Harrison J. Barrett, tried
on charges of conspiracy in connec
tion with their duties as law officers
of the Postoffice Department, a verdict
of not guilty was rendered. The throng
which filled the court room throughout
the arguments to' the jury hardly had
time to leave the building before the
jury was back and the foreman an
nounced that a verdict had been reach
ed. General Tyner, expecting a longer
wait, had been wheeled from the room
and his nephew and co-defendant has
tened to give an order which caused
him to return.
General Tyner appeared greatly ex
cited as he attempted to face the jury
and whei\ the verdict was returned he
broke down completely. Several of the
jurors wept with him and all of them
shook hands with him. ' ,
The Tyner-Barrett case was begun
on May 2 and has been before the
'court fop*tilneteen full days.
The "prTnclpal arguments made to
day were by A. S. Worthington, for the
defense, and Major Holmes Conrad,
special counsel for the Government for
the prosecution. The latter directed
his efforts almost entirely to an at
tempt to counteract any influence on
the jurors' verdict which might" result
from sympathy with General Tyner.
He told the jury that they had no right
to entertain sympathy for General Ty
ner, nor the young wife of Barrett, who
was a witness in the defendants' be
half.

The appointment of General Man
ager Frazler comes on the eve of
President Foster's departure for Eu
rope. He had been planning this trip
lor a number of months and desired
to relieve General Manager Whiting of
his duties before his departure. Re
cently negotiations between President
Foster and Superintendent Schindler
of the valley branch of the Santa Fe
road resulted in the latter's accepting
\he position with the California North
western, but on the eve of entering on
,his duties he received an offer of a
higher position with Henry E. Hunt
ington in Los Angeles, and accepted it.
James L. Frazier retired from the
peneral superintendency of the Tole
do, St. Louis and Western Railroad,
more familiarly known as the "Clover
Leaf Route," but a short while ago,
and came to this city on a visit about
ten days ago. He had hardly arrived
here before his services were sought
by President Foster, and after care
fully looking over the road, with
Â¦which he is very familiar, the position
of general manager was accepted.
A circular announcing his appoint

"President A. W. Foster yesterday. H.
C. Whiting, who has held the position
of general manager of the road for
many years, but^ whose failing health

One of the features developed was
that neighboring tenants in the Cross
ley building heard screams from El
kan Cohn's ofilce and when they rush
ed in they found Guttel choking him.
At other times Guttel is said to have
beaten the old man. Cohn's friends
say that Guttel has sold three resi
dences in the Richmond district to
Cohn and received the money for them.
Investigation, it is said, proved that
Guttel had no ownership in the proper
ty. Altogether, they estimate, Guttel
has secured more than' $30,000 from the
elder Cohn. It is stated that a prom
inent attorney of the city is mixed up
in the alleged swindles.
At 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon Cap
tain Martin sent Detective Tom Gibson
out to make inquiries. Gibson accom
panied Moritz Cohn to Alameda, where
it was supposed Guttel would be found.
There it was learned that he had left
for Chicago the night before. Gibson
stated that from the actions of Moritz
Cohn and his brother neither of them
wanted the accused man arrested.
Cohn refuses to discuss the case. He
stated that he did not care to talk
about the "gold br^ck" story. Appar
ently he is much broken in health and
mind. He is rated as a millionaire and
lives at 405 Bush street, tnis city. He
has a brother, Mcrritz Cohn, who Is
also supposed to be wealthy, and who
is seemingly taking a keen interest in
the alleged robbery of the elder broth
er. He reported the transaction to the
Police Department Tuesday night, but
has failed to make good his promise to
have his brother swear to a complaint.
In such a state is the affair that there
can scarcely be a prosecution of Gut
tel.
Elkan and Moritz Cohn made their
first start in Nevada. They accumu
lated money, but they fought. The
records of the Nevada courts are^bur
dened with the suits over real estate
between the two brothers. In this city
Moritz Cohn has said several times
that he wished to have his brother
declared mentally incompetent.
GUTTEL CHOKES COIIX.
COIIX REFUSES TO TALK.
Mystery veils the peculiar transac
tion wherein aged Elkan Cohn tried to
have a "gold brick" coined at the Mint
on Tuesday. The ; spurious ingot
would have been worth $25,000 had it
been gold.
The evidence shows that Cohn al
most fainted when he discovered that
his brick was as worthless as an equal
weight of brass filings, but the singular
feature of the case is that he declines
to prosecute the man who swindled
him.
Cohn is a money lender who has of
fices in the Crossley building at the
corner of Second and New Montgomery
streets. The man who sold him the
brick is Max Guttel, who is said to
keep a junk store on Third street and
who lives at 1556 Railroad avenue. Ac
cording to Cohn" office employes Gut
tel has devoted most of his time to the
race track.
Blackmailing is strongly charged by
Conn's friends as the real cause why
he should buy for $18,00p a burden that
was worthless. It Is openly stated that
Guttel formerly imposed on Cohn to
the extent of $7000 and gave him the
"gold brick," valued at $25,000, to settle
the account.

"Ah want ter be arranged wlf
Gawge," 6ald Miss Selma Taylor
(quadroon) when she was placed be
fore Judge Mag>an and accused of bat
tery.
"You mean 'arraigned,' I presume,"
his Honor suggested.
" Yis, sir; an* ef it pleases de coht,
Martin Hannon says he Is not the
John T>oe who assaulted William A.
Lucas of 2251 Mission street on a
Kentucky-street car one evening of
last week, and he resents his arrest
for the offense, because he bears few
or none of the physical characteristics
described In the warrant Issued for
the arrest of John Doe. Moreover, he
can prove an alibi strong enough to
convince Judge Mogan that Mr. IÂ»U
cas has another guess coming as to
the Identity of his assailant The
case will be called next Monday.
From the waistband of Charles R.
Brewer's trousers protruded the han
dle of a 45-caliber Colt's revolver as
he sauntered along Pacific street
Tuesday evening, and when arrested
for having in his possession a deadly
weapon he expressed great surprise.
"Down In Geowgia, suh," he said
to Judge Cabaniss, "a gentleman la
not Interfered with by the police so
long as his weapon is In plain eight.
It was igno'ance of j r o' law, suh, that
led to my arrest"
Then he went on to state that be
fore he left hjs native Georgia to tour
the great West he heard that the
Barbary Coast of San Francisco was
a rather tough slum, and It was for
self -protection only that he packed a
pistol while Inspecting It
"Yo* must allow, suh," he added,
"that If I had been ha'bohing feloni
ous intent- I wouldn't have made a
public exhibition of my revolvah."
He wes dismissed.
No, the complaining witness was
not ready to swear any such thing.
Then the lawyer conceded that the
document was a Chinese lottery tick
et, but it had been issued more than
a year ago and was preserved as a
curiosity by his client. Dismissal of
defendant by Judge Mogan.
"How do you know," Inquired the
defendant's attorney, flourishing aloft
the exhibit, "that this Is a lottery
ticket? Are you ready to swear that
It is not a Japanese love letter or a
plan of the Port Arthur fortifica
tions?"
In substantiation of his charge that
George Ske, a diminutive Jap, had a
Chinese lottery ticket In his posses
sion the complaining policeman sub
mitted as evidence a sheet of rice pa
per that looked as if an Ink-soaked
mouse had crawled over it. George
was exhibiting it to a compatriot
when the arrest was made.
Mrs. Quirk, at whose house J. J.
Heaney is a boarder, paid the $10
which he pleaded inability to pay for
the support of his minor child. Judge
Fritz accepted the installment and con
gratulated Mr. Heaney on having
such an accommodating landlady.
Judson R. Luckhurst, similarly ac
cused, was dismisses by Judge Fritz,
with consent of the attorney for the
Citizens' Alliance. The complainant
could not prove identity.
Joseph Egan, alias "Kid," is held in
$1000 to stand trial in the Superior
Court on the charge of brutally beating
a non-union stableman. The prelimi
nary examination was before Judge
Mogan.
An additional complaint has been
entered against Mrs. Anna Speakman,
charged with attempting to murder
Mrs. Clara Lefevre by cutting her
â¢nith a carving knife last Thursday at
709 Page street. Mrs. Ella T. Walker
and Mrs. Shaw, dressmakers, were
present when the Speakman- Lefevre
combat took place, and Mrs. Walker
now charges Mrs. Speakman with hav
ing assaulted, her with a deadly
weapon â the same carving knife â by
slashing her hand while she was at
tempting to stop the fight. Mrs. Shaw
alleges that she, too, was cut by Mrs.
Speakman's weapon while she was en
deavoring to restore peace, but Mrs.
Shaw has not filed formal complaint.
Both cises are set for June 4 before
Judge, Mogan.
Minnie Rice, the other woman in the
case, promised to return to her hus
band and respectable living if Judge
Mogan would dismiss the charge of
vagrancy on which she was arrested at
the time of the razor work, and his
Honor took her word for it.
There are baseball fans of long
standing !n this community who will
learn withÂ» gratification that Al Kelly,
erstwhile their idol, was not the mur
derous wretch that Miss Gertie Wil
liams depicted in her complaint charg
ing him with having slashed her face
with a razor at 171 Minna street. While
less notorious than the Kelly of Bos
ton, whose ability made him the first
$10,000-a-year prize beauty of the pro
fession, and while his fame did not
spread as extensively as that of his il
lustrious namesake of Philadelphia,
*vhose slide to the plate wrested vic
tory from the jaws of defeat and was
embalmed in verse, this California
Kelly was the pride of the bleachers
and the glory of the grand stand when
for several consecutive seasons he
twirled the sphere for the San Fran
cisco team and struck out its rivals.
And when King Alcohol at last
knocked him out of the box he was ac
companied to the shelf by the regrets
and good will of thousands to whom
his playing had conveyed local pride
and winning tickets. These are the
folk who will be glad to hear that Miss
Williams exaggerated her portrayal.
Judge Cabaniss dismissed the charge
of assault with a deadly weapon after
he had heard the evidence. Kelly stat
ed that the complainant and a young
woman named Minnie Rice, both armed
with razors, were about to engage in
a duel when he butted in to prevent
bloodshed, whereupon Miss Williams
turned her weapon upon him and cut
his upper lip and cheek before he suc
ceeded in wresting the blade from her
hand. In the struggle for possession
of the weapon the woman's face was
slashed accidentally. In court she
could not disprove the defendant's
statement.
Abraham Lincoln Frlckes. who came
down from Healdsburg with a check
for $75 in his possession, was in the
company of known thieves when a po
liceman rescued him and placed him in
the city prison for safe keeping of his
wealth. As he sat in Judge Fritz's
courtroom the human harpies hovered
in the corridors awaiting his release,
but Bailiff Conlan spotted them and
saw to it that Mr. Frickes was not re
stored to their company.
Fred Box and Arthur Cox were the
names given by two young ironwork
ers charged with having phinese lot
tery tickets in their possession.
"That's an improvement on Doe and
Roe," said Judge Mogan, "and is less
monotonous than Smith and Jones or
Brown and Robinson. Case continued."
A jury in Judge Mogan's' court will
hear the case against Manuel Magglo,
accused of offering for sale in his store
on Washington street a striped bass
that was several ounces less than three
pounds in weight. The trial has been
set for June 1.
Matilda Peterson confessed that her
yachting costume/ was worn simply and
solely because it enhanced her personal
attractiveness, and then she expressed
intention to return to her home In
Haywards if Judge Mogan would dis
miss the charge of vagrancy, on which
she had been brought before him.
"Never was aboard a yacht In my
life," she confessed, "and bought these
clothes just because they are becom
ing."
She was ordered to cross the bay on
a ferry-boat, j
Mrs. Peter McGrath, who had her
husband arrested for fiurling a stone
matchbox at her head, was In re
pentant mood when she appeared be
fore Judge Mogan, and her tears
flowed freely as she requested lenient
treatment for her only means of sup
port- The case was continued -till
June 1 to give Mr. McGrath oppor
tunity to show that he Intends to re
form.
Henry Wehner pleaded guilty to
having obtained $50 from a money
lender by means of a false order, and
Judge Mogan will sentence him to
day.
Miss Taylor explained that George
Smith, also colored, was the person
with whom she desired to sink or
swim. He was arrested with her and
pleaded that he was a professional
musician.
"The Joint inning is set for May 27,"
was the court's order.

NEW TORK, May 25.â Morris Park's
wonderfully successful eighteen days
of racing was brought to a fitting close
to-day in the presence of a great at
tendance, when James R. Keene's Del
hi, following 'in the footsteps of the
same turfman's illustrious Commando,
won the Belmont Stakes, adding $15,695,
Including a piece of plate, to his own
er's racing account. This places Mr.
Keene second on the list of winning
owners, with a total of $29,710 to his
credit at this meeting. This total is
only exceeded by that of H. B. Duryea,
who owes his lead with $32,S>15 to the
Metropolitan handicap, won by Irish
Lad; the National Stallion Stakes, won
by Tanya, and some minor, races.
Owing to the impression that Delhi
could not stay there was a liberal price
against him. A great deal of money
went in on John A. Drake's Rapid
Water, which was second choice. E.
E. Smathers' Leonidas was third
choice, while Columbia Stable's Grazial
lo and H.H. Brown's Conjurer were next
in favor. Conjurer suffered at the
start, as he was flatfooted and some
lengths away from the others when the
barrier waa released. Delhi went to
the front almost at the start and was
never headed. Summaries:

NEW TORK. May 25. â The feature
NEW TORK, May 25. â With per
fect weather in prospect and at least
a dozen high class thoroughbreds sure
to start, the creat Brooklyn handicap
at Gravesend to-morrow promises to
be one of the greatest running races
ever seen on the American turf. The
distance is a mile and a quarter and
the purse will be $20,000. Irish Lad,
from the stable of Herman B. Duryea,
winner of last year's Brooklyn; Her
mis, owned by E. R. Thomas; Mc-
Chesney, in the colors of E. E. Sma
thers; The Picket, from the Waldeck
stables, and Africander, bearing the
Hampton stables' colors, are the most
talked of group in the list. . McChes
ney has been somewhat backward in
his work. He was left at the post in
his only race this season and later
slightly injured his right fore foot.
The damaged hoof quickly responded
to treatment and Mr. Smathers was so
well satisfied with his workout to-day
that the great five-year-old will un
doubtedly face the starter to-morrow.
Irish Lad. with his advantage in the
weights, is favorite, but his work since
he won the Metropolitan handicap at
Morris Park has not been entirely sat
isfactory. However, he has shown his
best qualities in actual contests and
Trainer Rogers has every confidence
in him.
Since the rather sensational mile
made at Morris Park last Saturday by
Hermis, formerly thought to be a late
horse, Mr. Thomas' entry has risen
wonderfully in public estimation and
he, with Irish Lad, McChesney and
The Picket, should furnish one of the
grandest exhibitions of speed ever
seen in this city. Those who favor
Hermis say that with a good start the
horse should beat Irish Lads time of
2:05 3-5 in last year's handicap.
. Africander's recent trial did not dis
close phenomenal form, as he finished
rather weakly in front of an inferior
field.
Hurstbourne, from the stable of
William B. Leeds, is well liked, but
has scarcely shown form equal to that
of his competitors.
The hope of the AVestern horsemen
is The Picket, winner of last year's
American Derby. He has been spe
cially pointed for the Brooklyn. His
speed trials have been little .short of
sensational. He is pronounced by
Trainer Reed in -as perfect condition
as a horse can be.
Claude, the winner of many West
ern Derbies* and second to The Picket
at Washington Park last June, will
also start. He is particularly strong
on a muddy track," but the Gravesend
course is likely to be fast to-morrow.
John A. Drake will not start his
Futurity winner, Savable, but Runnels
will go. City Bank, owned by John
E. Madden, is speedy, but High Ball,
last season's champion, and most of
the others on the entry list do not ap
pear dangerous. The entries, owners,
Jockeys and probable odds follow:
CHICAGO, May 25.â Hawthorne race
track was favored with the finest kind
of racing weather to-day and the Las
sie stakes for 2-year-old misses was
sufficient attraction to draw a big mid
week crqwd. The Lassie stakes was the
feature of the card and seven 2-year
old fillies went to the post to try fctr
the purse. The race was at five fur
longs. J. S. Barber's La Londe won
the race by a neck from Miss Inez.
The latter beat Peggy O'Neil four
lengths 'for the place. The net value of
the stake was $2160. The Durnell en
try, Peggy Mine and Lady Lasca, waa
favorite at 13 to 5. Neither of them got
any part of the money. Watermelon,
ownrd by S. C. Wagner, one of the
owners of Worth racetrack, was made
the medium of a killing in the first race,
which he won in a hard drive with
Freesias, another good thing. The
Wagner gelding was backed from 30 to
1 down to 15 at post time and was one
of the best played of the thirteen start
ers. ThreÂ° favorites won. Summaries:

REDDING. May 25.â Th? sawmill of thÂ«
Redding and B'sr Bend Lumber Company, lo
cated aixty miles northeast of this city, waÂ»
destroyed by fire Tuesday nlrht.
"Jinks" Walsh, a big husky hay
maker, with an improved windmill
wallop, essayed to go a few with Harry
Chester, the light-heavyweight ama
teur king. "Jinks" knew as much
about the game as a milliner does
about loading a truck, and the result
was he was treated to a tattooing
about the head and body. Chester
had no wallop, but he landed often
enough to make a dead one of "Jinks."
The gallery enjoyed the mixup greatly
and were not slow to tell "Jinks" of
his shortcomings.
Al Young: and Tom McGreal, the
Hawthorne kids, executed the brother
ly act to the limit. Each was careful
to see the other was not hit loo hard.
Young was given the decision simply
because some one had to have it. There
was little rough work done, though
the pair would lead the spectators to
believe they meant harm by the man
ner in whfch they sparred around and
rushed from one end of the ring to
the other.
The amateur lightweight title
changed ownership when its holder,
Bob Lundie\ was outfought at every
point of a great four-round battle by
Lew Powell, the sturdy youth from the
Hawthorne Club. Powell had the
class, and from the tap of the gong he
jabbed and punched his game oppon
ent at will. Powell showed he is a
comer by the way he sidestepped and
used his mitts.
Pete Sullivan was awarded the palm
of victory over Jack Adams after the
lads had .swung their rights and lefts
for four rounds. The decision was
hardly fair, as Adams landed the
cleaner blows and seemed to be win
ning. He had a terrible right swing
and every time he landed, Sullivan was
forced to take to the carpet.
The sturdiness and hard-hitting
powers of Bob Cairns stood him well
in his mill with his club mate, Bert
Marsh. After they had gone four fast
rounds he was awarded the prize.
Marsh was clever and he worried
Cairns and occasionally staggered him
with his choppy left jolts. Cairns waa
the aggressor and his blows had a
deal of steam behind them. In the
last round he was pressing Marsh
hard.
The clown go was furnished by Jim
Daly and Billy Batten, one hundred
and twenty-five pounders. The lads
forgot all they had learned about the
game while they were making the trip
to the ring. When they started going,
each insisted on getting tired in about
a minute. When it was all over, the
judges gave Daly the decision on gen
eral principles.
Jack Ward and Jim Higgins/ two
bantams, opened proceedings with a
hurricane mill that lasted a round and
a half. Ward had his man all but
stowed away in the first round, but
the battered one came back and
fought like a champ, staggering Ward
with a few well-placed right v swings.
Jliggins waa weak when he came up
for the second, and after Ward floored
him twice. Referee Graney stopped
the affair.

* San Francisco was lucky enough to
.piow away five runs in the first two
rounds of the baseball battle yesterday
at Recreation Park. The Portland
i'ospere did not quit at all, they kept
cutting down the big lead systematic
ally and gamely. They hit, and hit
liard. but the last man died in the
ninth inning with a man resting on
second and one run needed to make it
a deadlock. Score: San Francisco 5.
I'.-rtiand 4.
. It iv as Â« tedious struggle extending
ihrouph two hours, but it became lively
and'foU <?f !ife and ginger after the first
fete rounds had b?en exhausted. In the
initial mund. three runs came shooting
it] for Hank. These were aided by two
,*!it5. a bas*e on balls and an error by
JÂ»:uhot at in? plate. Two more follow
ed 4n the next period and then it look
ed as -though the game was a dead
â¢ â¢lie.
Strange to say. Druhot settled down
Â«n*l bepan to pitch great ball. Stranger
.-till, his fielders took a new lease of
Hfe and wont after everything. The
Mrangest part of the whole layout was
liio v.ay the Portland stickers began
Â¦0 get jerry to the curves of Yerkes and
'Â¦>cat all kinds of tattoos on them.

in the next, but the big thing was pull

Vas clouted to the far corners and two
Port landers roved in. Had the Web
footors ben able to show some speed
'â¢Â¦n the base? they would be piling VP
'tallies yet. but their slowness kept the
i^.ins down to two. One more happened
in rcund six and that was all for the

CEEAMER PILOTSCLAUDE
and was given an ovation when the de
cision was announced.
Before the men left the ring they
nearly became involved in a free-for
all. Rodenbach strolled over to Ber
ger's corner and hinted that if he had
been in better condition he would have
knocked out the Olympic boxer. This
riled Sam and the two started to mix
it. A captain of police rendered a
quick decision and the special round
was speedily squelched.
Jack Munroe was Introduced to the
crowd and was heartily received. Joe
Long and Walter Marino were also in
troduced by Announcer Terry Murnane
as anxious to meet the winner of the
chief go. Alec Greggains will endeavor
to bring Rodenbach and Andy Galla
gher together before the former de
parts for home. Andy is strong and
clever and the event ought to prove a
rare drawing card.
The judges and referee were unani
mous in agreeing upon the winner and
Rodenbach could not complain of
Western partiality, for he had many
friends in the building to start with
Rodenbach was as nimble and spry
en his feet as Philadelphia Jack
O'Brien and kept his left working over
time very much after the style of that
crafty ringstrr. His right hand he
might just as> well have left back in
the Empire State and saved so much
excess baggage.
In the first round Rodenbach turned
ioose a package of lefts that must have
made Sammy think he had dropped
into a glove factory. First he would
shoot a straight one in and follow It
with a pwing. If the Olympian became
obstreperous the champion would
clinch and of course was immune from
any punishment. Berger's nose man
aged to get in the way of a belated left
and he went to his corner bleeding
slightly at the call of time.
OLYMPIAN'S WORK IMPROVES.
Sammy showed to better advantage
in the second round, but Rodenbach
fctoppod in one place about as long as a
hungry flea and Berger seemed non
plused. Near the close Berger tried
rushing tactics, but. could not have
nailed his man with a lariat. He did
'and onp hard right to the solar plexus
which made Rodenbach smile back
ward. The latter's nose was bleeding
Flightly when the gong sounded.
Berger lost ground in the third,
Rodenbach's left being a frequent caller
at his store, and a knockout in the
fourth was his only salvation. He tried
for this" in the last, but with ill suc
cess. In a mix-up in Rodenbach's
corner the latter received a cut over
the right eye. Sam made the champion
break ground several times, but his
lack of experience and aggressiveness
was painfully apparent.
JUDGES ARE UNANIMOUS.
After Bob Lundle had lost the coast
lightweight championship to Lew Pow
ell, the latter unquestionably a "com
er," and Jack Ward, Jim Daly, Pete
Sullivan. Bob Cairns, Al Toung and
Harry Chester had earned the deci
sions of Judges'. Phil Wand and Eddie
Smith and Referee Eddie Graney, the
two stars appeared.
Both entered the ring shortly after
11 o'clock. Rodenbach was looked after
by his manager. Paddy Moran. Tim
McGrath and Billy McDonald. Berger
had behind him "Spider" Kelly, Gene
Van Court and Danny Whelan. There
was considerable haggling over the
question of hitting in the clinches and
breakaways.
BERGER'S TACTICAL MISTAKE.
Rodenbach insisted that the amateur
rules be lived up to and carried the
day. In agreeing not to hit in the
clinches Berger signed his death war
rant, but there was apparently no al
ternative.
Along toward 8 o'clock the support
ers of Rodenbach unllmbered and 10 to
S was the prevailing quotation, with
Berger still on the long end.
BETTING ODDS SHORTENED.
A great career had been mapped out
for "Smiling Sammy," and so confi
dent were his friends that he would
lower flie colors of the New Yorker
that they made him a 10 to 6 favorite
in the downtown betting resorts. In
fact, a few wagers were made at odda
of 10 to 4.
The pugilistic aspirations of Sam
Berger, the 1 Olympic Club's heavy
weight Idol, were temporarily checked
at Mechanics' Pavilion last evening by
William Rodenbach, the American
middle and heavy weight amateur
champion of the West Side Athletic
Club, New York.
The two crack boxers figured as the
star attraction of an excellent pro
gramme of events furnished by the
Hawthorne Athletic Crub, all under the
able management of James W. Cof
froth. While not a Britt-Corbett house
by any means, the spacious old pavil
ion was well filled.

Mrs. Harding -was a native of New
York and 62 years of age. Ten years
ago she came to California. A hus
band survives her. Deceased was
prominent in the Ladies of the Grand
Army.
SAN JOSE, May 25.â A dish of straw
berries caused the death of Mrs. Mary
C. Harding in this city last evening.
During the afternoon she purchased
some berries from a store and after
she had eaten a few sne became 111
and suffered from acute pains in the
stoniaclL A physician was summoned,
but he was unable to alleviate her suf
ferings and she died a few hours later.
It la thought the berries had been
sprinkled with some poison while
growing.
Spex-ial Dispatch to The Call.
Miss Lena Rummel, one of the pret
tiest girls in the park, was chosen to
present ex-King F.'sAtzeroth with a
retiring memento of his reign.
George Seyden, M. Stehn, D. Stege
mann and A. Westphal acted as her
alds to the king, and did .their part
well.
The enthusiasm was now at its
greatest point, for any well-directed
shot would knock the last portion
from its high position and win the
knlgship for the lucky marksman.
As John Woebcke, one of the consist
ent shots of the company, steadied his
rifle and fired the last shot of the day,
every vestige Of the bird came down.
Amid tremendous cheering he was
placed In a chair, mounted on a table,
and carried around the grounds and
into the large pavilion. President
John D. Heise introduced the new king
to his assembled comrades, and hoped
for a successful reign. Miss Ella Stell
ing, a handsome brunette, then came
forward and invested "King Woebcke
with a wreath of roses and the insignia
of his office.
The company, under command of
Captain Henry Stelling, paraded over
100 men, about eighty of whom
entered the king shooting contest. The
target on this occasion represents the
body of an eagle and is divided into
different sections, each part represent
ing a prize. The different portions are
fastened with wooden pins. In order
to bring a part to the ground it is
necessary that one of the pins be
struck. The distance is seventy-five
yards.
Much interest and a great deal of
enthusiasm prevailed when the com
pany was lined up for the shooting.
John Beuttler, J. Kohs and D. Stege
mann were the first three men called
upon to display their skill. Luck was
against them and no prize fell to their
effort.
When John Tiedemann faced the
target, and after deliberate aim
brought down 'the crown and ring, he
was greeted with cheers. Lieutenant
David Salfield was the next man to
score, and the left claw fell with his
well-directed shot. Then came Veter
an J. H. J. Seyden, who carried the
eagle's head about the park as a
memento of his skill. Captain Charles
Oldag secured the left wing, and also
toppled off the left claw with the
same shot. When Adolph Grantz
stepped -up to show his ability the
members expected something to hap
pen, and the eagle got it in the neck.
The right wing was won by A. West
phal: tail by August Jungblut, apple
by F. Hensel and the sceptre by Cap
tain John Thode.
After all these parts were shot
away the breastplate of iron, which
protects the last portion^ of the bird,
was removed, and all made ready to
win kingly honor; for it Is the marks
man who brings down the last rem
nant who is crowned king of the
Schuetzens. As shot after shot was
fired and the target fluttered in the
breeze like a wounded bird, it was
expected to fall at any moment. When
F. Rust fired and broke off a piece
of the small portion remaining the
spectators expected to see him king.
Then came August Jungblut, steady
of eye and nerve, and as his shot rang
out a large piece of the eagle fell off,
but the last portion failed to fall.
John Woefccke is king of the Schuet
zens. By his steady arm and good
marksmanship he brought down the
last remnant of the eagle yesterday at
Shell Mound Park. The eagle shoot
ing of the San Francisco Schuetzen
Verein Is one of the most important
events among riflemen. On this oc
casion the fortunate rifleman is
crowned king for the ensuing year
and .receives a substantial purse to
maintain royal honors. â¢
The San Francisdo Schuetzen Verein
is the oldest shooting company in San
Francisco, having been organized in
September, 1859, and yesterday was
its forty-flfth anniversary at the target
and the ending of three days of
festivities.

THE FUTURE RBVEALED." THE PAST
DISCLOSED.
The Present Analyzed by Livingstone.
PROF. LIVINGSTONES readings are like
a living page of Flammaiion's treatise that is
so electrifying the wcrid to-day. He is no
imitator. His wcrk Is upon original liner-,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to know and works In the open
lteht.
He is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he i-? for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading is not a life reading. Wh?n
you call on PKOF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full liie reading for $1. A test Is
of little value: when the mind is troubled you
need more substantial aid and advice. This
is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE gives
you when you call on him for a flrst-class
clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mcntlcn all the Ills and mis- i
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you. nnd the cause of trouble ana"
suggest the remedy.

HOT SPRINGS, May 25.â The pool
rooms were unmercifully fleeced to-day
by a clever wire tapping, easily exe
cuted on account of the recent stoppage
of the Western Union service. Four
races were wrongfully reported and
settled for, and as a result the local
poolrooms lost thousands of dollars.
In the first race at St. Louis they
paid on Sylvan Belle to win. which
ran third. In the third race settlement
was made on JIngler to win, which was
not In the money. P. J. Somers. in the
first race at Chicago, was wired a win
ner, when "Watermelon *von, and in the
third race Aunt Katherine was given
as the winner when La Londe came in
first.

PETALUMA, May 25. â A fast track
and good weather aided in making the
racing to-day the best of the season
at Kenilworth Park. The feature of
the card was the Petaluma stakes.
Mrs. Coffey's colt Laocoon won by a
head, with Forest King and Colonel
Van driving hard a length apart. The
time was the fastest made for the
mile at this meeting. Every race on
the card was hotly contested, except
the first, which Tom Kingsley won
handily. Sir Preston took his second
stake, leading the favorite, My Sur
prise, out a length. Rafour's Chicka
dee, which has been made a favorite
throughout the meet, took her first
race to-day. The summary:

It is feared that disaster has befallen on*
of a number of sailing vessels which left New
Tork or Philadelphia about a month ago, load
ed with case coal oil and bound for an oriental
port. The British steamship Florida, which
arrived at New Tork yesterday from Cal
cutta, reports that May 5. about 100 miles east
of the Nantucket light, she passed a lot of
wreckage, among which were, many cases of
coal oil. A rait and small boat, the latter
upwldedown. were seen among the flotsam. The
day before meeting the wreckage the Florida
experienced a very severe gale. As a result
of this report every Hailing vessel loaded with
coal oil that could have been in the vicinity
of this wreckage was posted for reinsurance.
The wreckage may have come from any of the
following vessels: Brlttsh ship Juteopolls. out
SI days from New Tork for Penang: German
ship Neck, out 21 days from New) Tork for
Yokohama: British bark Wynford. out 28 days
from New Tork for Shanghai: British ship
Queen Elizabeth, out 87 days from New Tork
for Hongkong; French nhtp La Rochecoucauld.
out 34 days from New Tork for Shanghai:
British chip Largo Law. out 31 days from
Philadelphia for Fremantle and the German
ship Willy Rlckmers. out 26 days from Phil
adelphia, for Nagasaki. They are all quoted
at 6 per cent, and the reinsurance speculator
who can Dick the lost vessel will realize big
returns on bis Investment.
Wreckage Tells of Disaster.
Whenever an advertisement is de
clared, to be beyond the pale of Ameri
can law the Paper Publishing Associa
tion will be notified and this associa
tion in turn will notify the papers con
taining the/objectionable matter. Pa
pers not reported in the publishers' as
sociation will be notified by the de
partment directly. Whenever a paper
persists in publishing such advertise
ments after notification, it will bo de
nied the use of the mails. This plan of
procedure was made and announced
at the Postofflce Department to-day.
The Postmaster General has been in
correspondence for a long time with
the publishers' association and with
medical societies and others on this
subject and they have promised thor
ough co-operation.
Mr. Robb, former assistant attorney
general for the 'Postofflce Department,
when the postal scandals were on, went
into the question of patent medicine
advertisements and his work in issu
ing fraud orders has been continued by
Judge Goodwin, his successor, who al
so has taken up the question of other
advertisements.
It %vas announced that there was to
be no general crusade against objec
tionable advertisements in newspapers,
but that each case would be taken up
individually by law officers of the de
partment and whenever a violation of
the law was shown, the newspapers
containing such advertisements would
be prohibited the use of the mails. The
law department of the postofflce will
itself pass on the character of the ad
vertisements and its decision will be
considered final.
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON.
WASHINGTON, May 25.â Officials of
the Postoffice Department have decided
to establish a censorship over news
paper advertisements and, with the
avowed intention of improving their
tone, will go into this question with
some thoroughness.

The movements of the Stewart Fruit
Company, recently organized with a
capital of $100,000, are being watched
with considerable interest by Northern
California fruitmen, for It is generally
understood that the new concern is
part of the Santa Fe Company's
project to compete with the Southern
Pacific Company in securing a big
share of the deciduous fruit shipment
from the Sacramento Valley.
The Santa Fe officials have denied
that their road is backing the'com
pany, but the denial has not satisfied
the public curiosity, especially in view
of the fact that the president of the
Stewart Fruit Company, "W. H. Stew
art, was until recently the Southern
California representative of the Cali
fornia fruit agency, and Its vice pres
ident, R. E. Lyons, was connected with
the distributors' combine, both of
which organizations are closely allied
with the Southern Pacific Company.
Yesterday the distributors' associa
tion, of which Alden Anderson is the
head, held a meeting at the Palace Ho
tel and invited J. S. Leeds, manager of
the Santa Fe's refrigerating car serv
ice, who is completing the plans of that
company for its Northern California
invasion, to be present. Although the
members of the association declined to
give out any details â¢ regarding Just
what took place at the meeting, it was
learned that they closely questioned
Leeds about the new fruit company,
and particularly regarding the reports
that it has the financial backing of the
railroad company.
Leeds, it is said, denied that the
fruit company was being financially
assisted by the Santa Fe, but one
thing he did not deny, and that was
that the company was inspired by the
Santa Fe. According to the best re
ports the Stewart Fruit Company has
extensive plans for establishing agen
cies throughout the Sacramento River
district and will contract to handle all
the fruit it can get over the Santa Fe
line into Chicago. In short, the cre
ation of the company is looked upon
as the fulfillment of the threat recent
ly made by' the Santa Fe that within
a month it would have representation
in ever^ shipping point north of San
Francisco.
President Stewart of the new com
pany is in this city conferring with
Manager Leeds of the Santa Fe car
service.
Another reception was held in the
divinity school this afternoon with
evening prayer conducted by the Bish
op and newly-made deacons. The new^
deacons have been assigned to duty as'
follows: C. M. Marrick, assistant to
the rector of St. Luke's Church, San
Francisco; "W. It. Hodgkin, assistant to
Rev. E. L. Parsons. St. Mark's Church.
Berkeley, and F. U. Bugbee. assistant
to Rev. Mr. Guthrie, rector of Alameda
church.
SAN MATEO. May 25.â The Church
of St. Mathew was crowded beyond its
seating capacity by a fashionable audi
ence this morning to witness the ordi
nation exercises of the divinity school.
Three students were ordained into the
order of deaconsâ C. M. Marrick, W.
R. Hodgkin and F. U. Bugbee. The
services were conducted by Right Rev.
William Ford Nichols, Bishop of Cali
fornia, assisted by Dean Trew of Los
Angeles, who preached the ordination
sermon.
Besides the Rev. "W. H. Powell of the
Santa Clara Divinity school and the
local rector. Rev. N. B. W. Gallway,
there were also several visiting clergy
men and a large number of the laity
from other parishes. A special car* was
required to accommodate the visitors
from San Francisco. The procession of
priests, deacons and students, headed
by the choir, from the parish house to
the church, was a most impressive and
interesting spectacle, which became
more dramatic as it proceeded down
the aisle singing the "Processional" to
the accompaniment of the . mighty
music from the grand organ.
Immediately following the solemn
and impressive ceremonies of ordina
tion a "reception was held in the parish
house at which all visitors and parish
ioners were Invited to partake of re
freshments.

UNITED STATES BONDS.
STOCK AND BOND EXCHANGE.
Feedstuffs rule firm, with light stocks. There
is no further change In Hay. The circular of
Somers & Co. says: Â»
"Shipments of hay show a marked diminu
tion from the receipts o* last week, the total
being 2200 tons, a decrease of almost 1000
tons; in spite of this we have a very dull
market. It was generally thought that with
lessened shipments there would be marked
activity ... In our market, but everybody re
ports a very . dull demand, so ! that although
strictly fancy grades of hay sell fairly, yet
the bulk of the present arrivals are moving
off very slowly. There are several reason* for
this:t During April we had an unprecedented
rush of hay to market, and. aa these ship
ments had to be disposed of. they, naturally
found their way. ' Into the barns ' of various
consumers throughout the city; so much was
forced off In this way that now we are feeling
the reaction and the natural demand is very
dull. Shipments to coastwise points have been
exceedingly light, for local cropa at all these
places are now being cleaned out, which ehuts
off the San Francisco market temporarily. The-
Hawaiian Islands are experiencing hard times,
and this too, tends to lessen hay shipments
very materially.'
"As to the new crop, it Is Impossible to
make a definite statement; reports are very
conflicting and at present we are inclined to
the opinion that after all the yield will not
be as treat as was originally anticipated."

CHICAGO, May 23.â From the start grow
ing weather in American and weakness in for
eign markets had a depressing influence ' on
wheat, the July option opening a shade to
*iCfÂ»ic lower at M>Hc to 8Â«Â»Â»c. During the
first half hour a little firmer tone was man
ifested, being strengthened by a reported set
tlement of the grain ehovelers' strike at Buf
falo. Small primary receipts in the Southwest
also tended to encourage bull traders. The de
mand, however, was not sufficient to cause
any considerable advance, the high point on
July being reached at 86T*c. Numerous bear
ish crop reports were received from the South
west, and. being accompanied, by selling orders
for the Et. Louis houses, the result was a
gradual weakening of values. A feature of
grain was the wide fluctuations of May de
livery, the price of that delivery Jumping from
95c to U6c and then as quickly reacting to
94Hc. Inasmuch as the short interest in the
mciith Is apparently inconsequential in amount
no partial significance was attached to this
sharp advance and subsequent decline. Trans
actions in all deliveries' were so light that the
maiket was easily affected either way. After
selling down to 85%c July closed at 8Uc. May
ranged between 944c and 98c. closing at 95c.
On a fair demand from a large provision
Interest a firm tone orevalled In corn. The
market closed near the hlsh point of the day.
July closed up %@4c at 47%c
In sympathy with other grains oats showed
an easier tendency early In the session, but
& fair demand from shorts soon caused a firm
undertone. July closed up %c at 3,S^c.
A large run of hogs with lower prices at the
yards caused some weakness at the start, but
enormous shipments of meats brought out a
good demand from shorts. The market closed
with July pork up 10c. lard up 6c and ribs
7V*>c higher.

left. Some of these vessels will not load be
fore October next, hence their deliveries here
will be pretty well scatterrd up to the end of
the year. There are no changes of any mo
ment In market values, as burners In the fuel
line for the moment is exceedingly quiet. Of
ferings are being made by Importers at a
shade less for future shipments. Some of the
yards here are carrying larsre stocks of coast
coal, for which a slightly reduced price is be
ing asked. As we are assured a fair crop of
grain later on. it Is anticipated that better
outward frflght? should prevail: and an Im
provement In grain freights outward signifies
lower Colonial coal freights inward. Hence, a
reduction in the carriage of coal may be figured
upon later in the year. There Is no decrease
in the output of fuel oil. and those utilizing
it show no desire to modify Its use. The low
price and rnried advantages In ltÂ»-use hold
its consumers. There is no change in its
value. Contracts are freely offered at pres
ent prices." s

very, very quiet, and the dealers at that end
who are lanrely lnterented nlve it as their be

those on the Coast who are usually considered
cautious buyers seem to think that prices are

. Judge Hunt's decision, which de
cides* that an office from which a per
son has been removed cannot be re
gained by an appeal to the injunction
law, "will affect a large number of
cases pending in his court. They were
instituted shortly after Mayor Schmitz
commenced his second term of office
by persons whose political heads were
removed. [' !_**'.
It will be observed that Lerflngwell Is not a
party therein, hence if the court were to
award the relief prayed for the result would
me that LefflngwelKs right to the office, in so
far as the collection of the salary thereof was
concerned, would be. In effect, determined and
that, too in a proceeding wherein he had not
been heard and to which he wm not a party.
To hold in this proceeding that an injunction
should be granted is to adjudge that Leffing
well is not entitled to collect the salary which
it seems he demands.- But if he is legally
acting as Election Commissioner he la unques
tionably entitled to the salary of the office,
and the court therefore cannot determine that
he shall be deprived of such salary without
adjudicating his right to the office to which
the salary is attached.
Though counsel for plaintiff disclaims any
Intent by the bill herein to question Lefflnj
well's title to the office, yet in challenging his
right to collect the salary thereof he In effect
Impeaches such right. But taking the bill aa
a whole? I think its main and essential purpose
is to determine Lefanftwell'a right to the pos
session of the office of Election Commissioner.
It is a masked assault upon his right to the
office and as such cannot be entertained.
NOT PARTY TO SUIT.
It is a well-settled principle of law that
courts of equity will not interfere by injunc
tion to determine the title to a public office;
they remit the claimants to the office, it there
be any. to their statutory remedy or to their
common law remedy by a. proceeding in the
nature of quo warranto. In Powers vs. Hitch
cock the Supreme Court says that there are
two methods provided in the Code of Civil
Procedure to test the title to office; the first
is by proceedings in the nature Of quo war
rant o against any person who usurps or in
trudes into a public office; the second Is by
contesting the election of the claimant aa
provided in the Code of Civil Procedure.
In this case plaintiff virtually concedes that
the title to a public office cannot be deter
mined in an action of this character; but be
claims that Leffingwell is not even a de facto
officer; that the purpose of the action Is sim
ply to prevent the squandering- of public funds;
that the complaint does not allege that Leffing
well is in possession of the office in question:
but It charges that no one was appointed to the
office of Election Commissioner, the salary
whereof Leffingwell is claiming.
Leffingwell demurred and in sus
taining the demurrer Judge \Hunt
says:
Such is the opinion of Judge Hunt
of the suit of L. W. Lindgren, Social
ist, former member of the Board of
Election Commissioners, for an in
junction restraining Auditor Harry
Baehr from auditing the salary de
mands of Elmore C. Leffingwell. Lind
gren's successor on the board. "There
fore," says Judge Hunt, "the demur
rer to the suit should be sustained."
The decision of Judge Hunt, which
was handed 'down yesterday, gives
Commissioner Leffingwell $417, for he
has not been able to draw a cent from
the city treasury since his appoint
ment to office, five months ago. A
few days after he received his ap
pointment Lindgren, the expiration of
whose term of office made possible
the appointment of Leffingwell, filed
the injunction procee'dings. He claim
ed that his successor should have
been, like himself, a member of the
Socialist party, and that, "as Leffing
well is a member of the Union Labor
party, his appointment was invalid
and a violation of the charter provi
sion governing the naming of mem
bers of the Election Commission. He
alleged that because of this infraction
of the charter Leffingwell was a usur
per and should not be allowed to draw
a salary. * v ~" i

Nathan Andrew Rowe, a business
man of Marysville, from whom Agnes
Jessie Rowe secured a divorce four
years ago, has been cited to- appear
before Judge SIoss on June 5 to ex
plain his failure to pay the $20 a
month alimony provided for in the
decree obtained by his wife. In her
petition for the citation Mrs. Rowe
says that he has not paid it since the
divorce was granted.
Divorces were granted to Norah
Nickells from Alfred Nickells for
neglect, Jopeph N. Appleton from Hel
en M. Appleton for desertion, and
Sarah J. Berlin from A. J. Berlin for
cruelty.
Judge Troutt granted Grace Hexter

Sallie Merx has been a matron since
last July, yet she is already pining for

filed a suit for divorce on the ground
of cruelty, alleging that she does not

ling her throat with a large claspknife
and threatening to kill her. Neither
does she think it right for her hus
band, Charles C. Merx, of the tug
Amelia, to meet her on the street and
compel her to walk with him by ex
hibiting a pocketknife and threatening
to jab hÂ£r with it unless she accom
panies him. She charges Merx with
doing these things and asks that she
be given a decree, sufficient monthly
alimony to keep her and for permis

"This sort of thing must not hap
pen again, gentlemen," said Judge
Kerrigan. "I am surprised that two
attorneys cf your years should partic
ipate in tuch an unseemly row. A re
currence of the affair will cause me to
punish both of you." v
And In order to give the belligerent
lawyers time to cool off h-Â» adjourned
court until this morning.
Baggett, who is the attorney for the
plaintiff, objected to the way Moore
was cross-examining Walter O'Connor,
a witness for the plaintiff. Moore dis
liked the remarks made by Baggett in
.voicing his objections, and turning to
him said:
"You are playing to the Jury. You
are trying to make a gallery play."
"I am not," said Baggett, jumping to
his feet. "You are the one who is
making the grand-stand plays, and I
will not stand for it."
"Oh," retorted Moore, "I guess you
will."
"Well, I will not," exclaimed Bag
gett, looking daggers at Moore and
getting very white. "I'll , slap your
face. I'll throw this pitcher of water
at you."
"I would like to see you try it,"
came bark Moore as he got out of his
chair. His son Stanley also arose from
his chair near Baggett and for a min
ute or mere it looked as If a bonny?
brook would follow the exchange of
warm words. But Judge Kerrigan took
a hand in the row at this juncture and
called the attention of the lawyers to
the fact that they should recall that
they were In court and that by their
actions thev were exposing themselves
to adverse comment and punishment.
A. A. Moore, attorney for the United
Railroads, and W. T. Baggett, two of
the oldest and most prominent attor
neys practicing in the State, made
things lively In Judge Kerrigan's court
yesterday during the trial before a jury
of the suit of William Whittington
against the United Railroads, an action
for $10jiC5 damages for the death of
Guy S. Whittington,' son of the plain
tiff.
The 1 attorney said that he had been
employed at* the request of a Mrs.
Fritz, who resides on Seventeenth
street.
Amedeo also told the board that he
had worked seven years in an Italian
arsenal manufacturing explosives for
the Government, thatÂ«he had no love
for that Government because he. had
been forced to do military duty and
that he had deserted from the Liguria
f,or that reason.
Two unknown .Italians called upon
Commissioner North v yesterday after
noon with an attorney to ascertain
whether it would be possible to obtain
an appeal from the decision of the
board of inquiry. Commissioner North
informed the lawyer that the time. for
an appeal to the Secretary of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor had
gone by, and that no appeal could be
taken after noon of the day preceding
that on which the deporting vessel is
advertised to sail. . ,
Amedeo is an expert handler of tor
pedoes, and for that reason the Italian
Government is desirous of having him
returned to the cruiser. Commissioner
North ordered that the sailor should be
sent back to his ship and requested
the Italian Consul to ship him on the
steamship Sonoma to-day. The vessel
will touch at Honolulu and the desert
er will be placed on board the Liguria.
which will wait at that port for him.
Amedeo admitted that he knew of
Rossi's reputation as an anarchist, that
Rossi, had given him. a copy of an an
archistic sheet printed In Patersan,
N. J., and that Rossi had informed him
that he and his associates were anar
chists. ' .
United States Immigrant Commis
sioner North yesterday convened a
special board of inquiry and examin
ed Amedeo as to his opinions, whether
anarchistic or otherwise. The sailor
was asked by Deputy Immigrant Com
missioner Schell whether he would
manufacture dynamite bombs if his
employer, Rossi, should request him
to do so, and the deserter replied that
he would perform any Job of work of
that kind to which he might be as
signed, no matter whether the bombs
were intended for a legal purpose' or
not.
He strenuously d'enled that he was
an adherent of anarchistic principles,
and asserted that he was a republican.
When asked to define a republic, he
said that it was a nation governed by
a president instead of a monarch. Be
yond this statement he did not appear
to have any knowledge of the sub
ject.
AX EXPERT HANDLER.
AMKDEO EXAMINED.
He is an associate of Caesar Crespi,
editor of an Italian newspaper, in this
city. This newspaper advocates Red
Republicanism, and Crespi announces
himself as an opponent of monarchies
and an upholder of a republican form
of government.
Storace was found at work in Rossi's
shop by Federal officers, on May 20,
armed with a warrant of arrest, issued
at the request of the Italian Consul.
Judge de Haven ordered Storace to be
surrendered into the custody of the
Consul, and to be detained in the City
Prison at the Consul's expense, such
imprisonment not to exceed three
months, as provided by the treaty be
tween Italy and the United States.
Itossi and Crespi thereupon engaged
an attorney, who applied to Judge de
Haven for a writ of habeas corpus on
the ground that the sailor was. being
Illegally deprived of his liberty. Judge
de. Haven refused to issue the writ,
sufficient cause not having been shown,
and the attorney then said he would
ask the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals for a writ of habeas corpus.
After Amedeo had come ashore
from the cruiser he was met, he said,
by another sailor who had deserted
from the Italian navy about six
months ago, and was taken to the
machine shop of Arturo Rossi on San
some street. Rossi is reputed among
United States secret service men to
be an anarchist, or something of that
kind.
An expert who will cheerfully make
bombs at the bidding of his employer
for lawful or unlawful purposes is an
unsafe person to be admitted into the
United States. Such was the decision
made yesterday by United States Im
migrant Commissioner North and a
special board of inquiry in the matter
of Storace Amedeo, a deserter from
the Italian cruiser Liguria, which ar
rived at this port on April 23.-
Woodward also filed with tite Board
of Supervisors a report regarding the
construction of a municipal bitumin
ous rock repair plant. The cost of
the plant is estimated at $18,500, and it
will permit of repairs at the rate of
4000 square feet per day. The report
refers to a portable repair plant put up
by an Eastern company, costing $10,000,
together with $3000 additional for inci
dental expenses.' The cost of operation
will be $125 per day, against $190 for the
first described. â¢ '.
The board postponed action on bids
for street sweeping until Â¦ June 7 Â«in
compliance with the request of the Su
pervisors, who will make an appropria
tion for a municipal street cleaning
plant. , - .
Varney & Green refused to remove
advertising fences at Fillmore and
California streets and a test of the
validity of the ordinance limiting. the
height of fences to ten feet will be
made. . â¢
The board recommended the pur
chase of land from S. Ducas for the
opening of Bessie avenue.
City Engineer . Woodward reported
that the cost of grading and filling in
the foot of Third street to the Santa
Ve bridge now building across Channel
street .will -be $15,000 and for putting
down fender piles and dolphins to pro
tect the bridge $3500, and urges that
the Supervisors appropriate the neces
sary, funds for the purpose..
Woodward says the boulevard 100
feet wide Is desirable in the locality
Earned and it could easily be connected
with any extension of MarX*t street.
However, as no provision is made for
its improvement he advises against
the abandonment of Ocean avenue un
til such provision is made. The exten
sion of Sixteenth avenue and all paral
lel avenues should be considered and
provision made for the outlet' to the
Ocean View district of the new sewer
age system. The charter dees not pro
vide any mode of procedure tor the
closing of streets more than 4% feet in
width, as are Ocean Â¦ and Nineteenth
avenues, and this Woodward considers
as being in the way of the acceptance
of the offer of the Spring Valley Com
pany.
City Engineer Woodward filed a re
port yesterday with the Board of Pub
lic Works on the proposition of the
Spring Valley Water Company to deed
land to the city for a boulevard
through Laguna Merced rancho in re
turn for the abandonment by the city
of Ocean avenue from Corbett road to
the Great, Highway and also of the
new extension of Nineteenth avenue to
Ocean avenue. The expense of grading
and macadamizing the new boulevard
is figured at $10,350, which Is consider
ably In excess of the lowest bid of.
$1903 55 to improve Nineteenth avenue.
