SURVIVING EVILS OF THE REIGN
\ OF TERROR. '
Does there exist an .Incredulous, or
jealous., denizen of another portion of
our co'untry who, knowing that the
room in the wooden cupola trver Mr.
Carewe's library "was commonly alluded
to by. Rouen as the "Tower Chamber,"
will prove himself so sectlonally preju
diced as to deny that the town was a
veritable hotbed of literary interest, or
that teir" Walter, Sc<-tt was ill-appreci
ated there? Some of the men looked sly,
and others grinned, at mention of this
apartment: but the romantic were not
lacking who spoke jof it in' whispers;
how the^llghts sometimes shone there
all night long, and the gentlemen drove
away, white! faced," in the dawn. The
cupola, rising above the library, over
looked the garden, and the house, save
for 'that, was of a single story, with a
low: veranda running the length of its
front: The windows of the library and
of a row of bedrooms â one of which was
Miss Betty'sâ lined the veranda,
"steamboat fashion:"- the inner doors
of these rooms all opening upon a Ions
hall which bisected the, house. The
stairway leading to the room In the cu
poia rose In the library Itself, wh!i* the
bisecting hall afforded the only across
to the -library: hence, ths gossips.- well
acquainted "with the geography 6f tha
place, conferred Seriously together upon
what effect Miss Betty's homecoming
would have' In this connection; for any
one going to the stairway must needs
pass her door; and, what was, more to

"But at 'present it was with the oppo
site pnd of" the house that the town
was occupied, for there, workmen' were
hammering and sawing and painting all
day ..long. , finishing the addition Mr.
Garewe was; building for his daughter'3
debut. 4 This hammering. disturbed Miss
a stroll with you this morning, and
your casual insistence on the shadl
ness of Carewe street!" He laughed
nervously, but her smile vanished, and
she continued, "Keep away, Tom. She
is beautiful, and at St. Mary's I always
thought she had spirit and wit, too. I
only hope Crailey won't see her before
the. wedding! But It isn't safe for you.
Oo along, now, and ask Crailey pleaae
to come at three this afternoon."
This message from Mr. Gray's be
trothed was all the one ill-starred Tom
conveyed to his friend. Mr. Vanrevel
was ordinarily esteemed a person of
great reserve and discretion; neverthe
less there was one man to whom he told
everything, and from whom he had no
secrets. He spent the noon hour in fee-,
ble attempts to describe to Crailey
Gray the. outward appearance of Miss
Elizabeth Carewe; how she ran like a^
young Diana; what one felt upon hear

self an example exhibiting something of
the cost of looking into her eyes. His

white gloves in his hand and dangled
a slender ebony cane from his wrist.
The flying, kitten headed toward the
couple, when, with a celerity only to be
accounted for on the theory that his
ey* had been fixed on .the Carewe gate
way for some time previous to thn
sudden apparition, the ' gentleman
leaped in front of the fugitive.
The kitten attempted a dodge to pass;
the gentleman was there before it. The
kitten feinted; the gentleman was al
together too much on the spot. Imme
diatelyâand Just as Misa â Carewe,
flushed and glowing, ran into the street
âthe. small animal doubled, evaded
Miss Betty's frantic clutch, re-entered
the gateway, and attempted a disap

of going round them,' only t<5 find it

In regard to the extraordinary agility
of which the pursuing gentleman was
capable, it is enough to say that he
caught* the cat. He emerged from the
lilacs holding it in one hand, his gloves
and white hat In the other, and pre
sented himself before Miss Betty with a
breathlessness not entirely attributable
to his' exertions.
For a moment, as she came running
toward him and he met her 'flashing
look, bright with laughter and recogni
tion and haste, he stammered. A thrill
nothing less than delirious sent the
blood up behind hts brown cheeks, for
he saw that .she, too, knew that thjs
was the second time their eyes had met.
Naturally, at that time he could not
know how many other gentlemen were
to feel that same thrill' (in their cases,
also, delirious, no less) .witKiihe same,
accompanying, ' mysterious' ' ' feeling
which came - Just before M^ss Betty's
lashes fell, that 'one had found, at last,

solemnly, offering the captive, " to re^

A CAT CAN DO MORE THAN LOOK
AT A KINO.
IF was long, ago in the days when
men sighed when they fell In love;
when people danced by candle and
â¢ lanip^ and did dance, too. Instead of
solemnly gliding about; in that mellow
â¢ time so long ago, when the young were
romantic and cummer was roses and
â¢ wine, old Carewe brought his lovely
daughter home from the convent to
wreck the hearts of the jputh of Rouen.
.That was not a fjir Journey; only an
afternoon's drive through the woods
and by the river. In an April long ago;
Miss Betty's harp carefully strapped
behind the great lumbering carriage,
her guitar on the front seat, half
. buried under a mound of bouquets and
odfijy shaped little bundles, farewell
. gifts cf her comrades and the good sis

email lace handkerchief, with which she

brimmed with the parting from Ei3ter
Cecilia. Sister Mary Bazilede, the. old
efon*-- st*>i>? and all the girls; but* for
every time that she li*ed the dainty
kerchief to brush away the edge of a
tear, she took a deep breath of the
Western woodland air and smiled at
least twice: /or the years of strict in
closure within St. Mary's walls and
still garden were finished and done with
.and at last the many-colored world
flashed and danced in a mystery before
â¢ her. This myetery was brilliant to the
consent, pirl because it contained men;
â¢she vcis Aper to behold it.
T: ey rumbled into town after sunset,
in thÂ« fair Cvilight, the dogs barking
before them, and every one would have
been surprised to know that Tom Van
. rgvel. instead of Mr. Crailey Gray, was
the flrs. c to see her. By the merest ac-
Cident. Tom was Rtrolilng near the
Carewe ajlace at the time; and when

. rattle arid, clink and clouds of dust at

to catrh something more than a glimpse
of a eray^klrt behind a "mound of flow

; the eyes thÂ«,-\t met his were remarkable
â¢ for ojjheJoreSeons than the sheer love
*llness of them, in that, even in the one
.flash of them he caught, they meant so
rnany things at one time. They were
sparkling, yet mournful; and they were
w lFtful, although undeniably lively
Â¦jViUi tV >Â» gayest comprehension of the
recipient of their glance, seeming to
Â«^y. "Oh, It's you. young man. is it!"
An? they were shy and mysterious
witÂ»Â» youth, full of that wonder at the
worlj which has the appearance, some
times.*of wisdom gathered in the un
known out of which we came. But,
above all. these eyes were fully con

only -that* one glance between them;
\ and the carriage disappeared, leaving
'â¢â¢{Â¦fern of epring flowers In the air.
The young man was left standing on
the woode^i pavement in the midst of a
pre?t loneliness, yet enveloped in the
afterglow, his soul roseate, his being
quavering, his expression, like his cane.

fluttering veil, a hand in a white glove
with a small lace gauntlet at the wrist.
This gesture was the final divinity of
the radiant* vision which regained with
the dazed young man as he went down
the street: and it may have been three
quarters of an hour later Â¦when the
background of the picture became vivid
io him; a carefully dressed gentleman
with heavy brows and a handsome
high nose, who sat stiffly upright be
eide the girl, his very bright eyes quite
i\Â« conscious of the. stricken pedestrian
as were hers, vastly different, however,
in this; that they glittered, nay. almost
bristled, with hostility: while every
polished button of his blue coat seemed
to reflect their malignancy, and to dart
little ecboicg shafts of venom at. Mr.

and. the moment of this realization oc

t<-rt-<' to eat his evening meal at the
"Kcruen. House." hp dropped his fork
rattling upon his plate and leaned back
staring at nothing, a proceeding of

Cnmmings. the editor of > the Rouen
Journal, v.as too bUEy over his river

"Have you heard what's new in
to"-}!^" asked Cumniings presently,
lo^Vinjr vr>.
â¢â¢No," taid Tom truthfully, tor he had
seen what was new, but not heard It.
"Old Carewe's brought his daughter
home. Fanchon Bareaud was with her
at St. Mary's until last year; and
Fanchon says she's not only a great
beauty but a great dear."
"Ah!" rejoined the other with mas
terly indifference* "Dare â dare
say." .
"No wonder you're not interested,"
said Cnmmings cheerfully, returning tÂ»
the discussion of his bass. '.The old
villain will take precious good care you
don't come near her."
Mr. Vanrevel already possessed a pro
found conviction to the same effect.
Robert Meilhac Carewe was known not
only as the wealthiest citizen of Rouen,
but also as its heartiest and most stead
fast hater: and, although there were
only five or six thousand inhabitants,
neither was a small -distinction. For
Rouen was ranked, In those easy days,
as a wealthy town; even as 4t was
called an old town: proud of its age
and its riches, and bitter in its politics,
of course. The French had built a fort
there, eoon after . LaSalle's last voy
age, and. as Crailey Gray said, had
settled the place and had then been set
tled themselves by the pioneer militia.
After the -Revolution. Carolinians and
Virginians had come, by way of Ten
nessee and Kentucky; while the adven
turous countrymen from Connecticut,
traveling thither to 'sell, remained to
buy â and then sell â when the country
was in its teens. In course of time the
HUle trading-post of the Northwest
Territory had grown to be the' leading
center of elegance and culture In the
Ohio Valleyâ at least they said so in
Rouen; only a few people in the coun
try, such as Mr. Irving of Tarrytown,
for instance, questioning whether a
center could lead.
The pivotal figure, though perhaps
not the heart, of this center, was un
questionably Mr. Carewe. and about
him the neat and tight aristocracy of
the place revolved: the old French
remnant, having liberally intermarried,
forming the nucleus, together with de
scendants of the Cavaliers (and those
who said they were) and the industri
ous Yankees, by virtue (if not by the
virtues) of all whom the town grew
and prospered. Robert Carewe was
Rouen's magnate, commercially and
socially, and. until an upstart young
lawyer named Vanrevel struck into his
power with a broad-ax, politically.
The wharves were Carewe's; the ware
houses that stood by the river, and the
line of packets which plied upon It,
were his; half the town was his. andCtU
Rouen this meant that he was porff
sessed of the Middle Justice, the higrji
and the low. His mother "was a'
French woman, and, in those days,
when to go abroad was a ponderous
and venturesome undertaking, the fact
that he had spent most of his youth in
the French capital wrought a certain
glamor about him; for to the American,
Parlf was Europe, and it lay shimmer
ing on the far horizon of every imagi
nation, a golden city, Scarce a draw
ing-room in Rcuen lacked Its fearsome
engraving entitled "Grand Ball at the
Tullerles," nor was Godey's Magazine
ever more popular than when It con
tained articles elaborate of similar
scenes of festal light, where brilliant
uniforms mingled with shining jewels,
fair locks, and .the white shoulders of
magnificently dressed duchesses, coun
tesses, and ladles., (Credit for this de
ecripticm should be given entirely to the
above mentioned periodical.) Further
more, a sojourn in Paris was held to
confer a "certain nameless and in
describable polish" upon the manner
of the visitor: also, there was some
thing called "an air, of foreign travel."
They talked a great- deal 'about polish
In those days; and some ..examples still
extant do not deny their^justiflcation;
but in the case of Mr. Carewe,* there ex
isted a citizen of Rouen, one already
quoted, who had the temerity to de
clare the polish to be in truth quite
nomeless and indescribable for the rea
son that one cannot paint a vacuum.
However, subscription to this opinion
ehould not be over-hasty, -since Mr.
Crailey Gray had been notoriously a
rival of Carewe's with every pretty
woman in town, both having the same
eye in such matters, and also because
the slandered gentleman could assume
a manner when he chose to, whether or
not he possessed it. At his own table
he exhaled a hospitable graciousness
which, from a man of known evil tem
per, carried. the winsomeness of sur
prise. When he wooed, It was with an
air of stately devotion, combined with
that knowingness which sometimes off
sets for a widower the tendency a girl
has to giggle at him; and the combina
tion had been, once on twice, too much
for even the allurine; Crailey. ' . Â¦
Mr. farewe lived in an old-fashioned
house on the broad, quiet, shady street
which bore his name. There was' a
wide lawn in front, shadowy under elm
and locust trees, and bounded by thick
shrubberies. A long gard.n. fair with
roses and hollyhocks, lay outside the
library windows, an old-time garden,
with fine gravel paths and green ar r
lors: drowsed over in summer time by
the bee*, while overhead the locust
rasped h's rusty cadence's the livelong
day; and a faraway sounding love note
from the high branches^ brought to
mind the line, like an old refrain:
"The voic* of the turtle was heart In thf land.
Between the garden and the carriage
gates there was a fountain "where a
bronze boy- with the dropsy (but Â¦ not
minding it) lived in a perpetual bath
from a green goblet held over hia head.
Nearby, a stone sun dial gleamed
against a clurap of lilac bushes; and It
was upon "this >pot{ that; the, white
kitten introduced Thomas Vanrevel to
Miss Carewe. / ;
Upon .the morning after her -arrival,
having finished- her pianoforte prac

guitar, Mies Betty read two .paragraphs

to his friends (such was his phrase).
he treated her with a perfunctory, civ
ility which mad'e her wonder lÂ£.b.Â«r,adrl
vent was altogether welcome tQ .him;,
but when 1 she noticed ; that his. halir_
looked darker than usfuaT about every,'
fourth day, she began to ' understand,
why he appeared' ungrateful *to her for/,
growing up. He went but a graat^deaV;
though no visitors came'to.th* h0twÂ«!,

was forbidden -to return Tier friend's

THE ROGUES' GALLERY OF A FA

TO A DAUGHTER WITH
PARTICULAR CARE. -.-, ' *
Those angels appointed to be guard
ians of the merry people of Rouen,
poising one night, between earth and
stars, discovered a single brilliant and
resonant spot, set in the midst of the
dark, quiet town like a jeweled music
box on a black doth. Sounds of rev
elry and the dance from the luminous
spot came up through the summer
stillness to the weary guardians all
night long, until, at last, when a red
glow stole into the east, and the dance
still continued, nay grew faster than
ever, the celestial watchers found the
work too heavy for their strength, and
forthwith departed, leaving the dancers
to their own devices; for, as every one
knows, when a dance lasts till daylight,
guardian angels flee.
All night long the fiddles had been
swinging away at their best; all night
long the candles had shone in thin rows
'of bright orange through the slits of the
window-blinds; but now, as the day
broke over the maples, the shutters
were flung open by laughing young
men. and the drivers of the carriages,
waiting in the dusty street, pressed up
closer to the pledge, or came within
and' stretched themselves > upon the
lawn, to see the people waiting In tbV
daylight. The horses, having no such
desires, stood with loosened check-reins,
slightly twitching their-upper lips, wist
ful of the tall grass which bordered the
wooden sidewalk, though now and then

In the world/ 1 .
"Why are you wearing that dress?"
He laughed, and pointed to where, be
hind him on the ground, lay L a long
gray cloak, upon which had been tossed
a white mask. "I'm on my way to the
masquerade," he answered, with an
airy gesture in the direction of the vio
lins. "I'm an Incroyable. you see; and
I had the costume ma.de from my recol
lection of a sketch of your great-uncl*.
I saw 'It a long time ago in your li
brary."
Miss Carewe's accustomed poise was
quite recovered; indeed, she was aston
ished to discover a distinct trace of dis
appointment that the brilliant appari
tion must offer so tame an explanation.
What he said was palpably the truth;
there was a masquerade that night, she
knew, at the Madrillon's. a little way
up Carewe street, and her father had
gone, an hour earlier, a blue domino
over his arm.
The Incroyable was a person of al
most magical perceptiveness; he felt
the let-down Immediately and feared a
failure. This would not do^the atti
tude of tension between them must be
renewed at once. "You'll forgive me?"
he began. In a quickly impassioned
tone. "It was only after you- sang, a
dream possessed me, andâ " "" '
"I cannot stay to talk to you," Miss
Betty interrupted, and added, with a
straightforwardness which made, him
afraid she' would prove lamentably di
rect: "I do not know you." ;
Perhaps she remembered that already
one young man had been presented to
her by no better sponsor than a whit*
cat, and had no desire to carry her
unconventionality farther than that In
the present instance there was not even
a kitten.
She turned toward the house, where
upon he gave a little pathetic exclama
tion of pleading in a voice ttiat was
masterly, being as sincere as It was
musical, and he took a few leaning
steps toward her, both hands out
stretched.
"One moment more!" he cried, as she
turned again to him. "It may be the
one chance of my life to speak with
you; don't deny me this. All the rest
will meet you when the happy evening
comes, will dance with you. talk with
you, see you when they like, listen to
you sing. I, alone, must ht/ver about
the gates, or steal like a thief into your
garden to hear you from a distance.
Listen to me â just this once â for a
moment?"
"I cannot listen," she said firmly; and
stood quite still. She was now in deep
shadow. 1 .
"Are you a murderer?"
"I will not believe you merciless I.You
would not condemn the meanest crimi
nal unheard!" Remembering that sh*
was so lately from the convent, he ven
tured this spee'eh in a deep, thrilling
voice, only to receive a distinct shock
for his pains, for she greeted it with an
irrepressible, most unexpected peal of
contralto laughter, and his lips parted
slightly with the surprise of it.
They patted much farther in the ne.xt
Instantâ in good truth. It may be stated
of the gentleman that he was left with
his mouth open â for, suddenly leaning
toward him out of the shadow into th*
light.' her face shining as a cast of
tragedy, she cried in a hoarse whisper:
And with that and a whisk of her
skirts, and a footfall on the gravel path,
she was ec#e. He stood dum
founded, poor comedian, having com*
to play the chief role, but to find tb*
scene taken out of his hands. Then
catching the flutter of her wrap, as she
disappeared into the darkness of the
veranda, he cried in a loud, manly
voice:
"You arÂ« a dear I"
As he came out into the street
through a gap in the hedge, he paused,
drawing his cloak about him. and lifted
his face to the eastern moon. It was a
strange face; the modeling most lik*
what is called Greek, save for the nose,
which was a trifle too short for that,
and the features showed a happy puri
ty of outline almost childlike; the blu*
eyes, clear, fleckless, serenely irrespon- (
Bible, with more the look of refusing re
sponsibility than being unconscious of
it; eyes without care, without pru
dence, and without evil. A stranger
might have said "he was about twenty
five and never had a thought in his life.
There were â¢ some blossoms on the
hedge, and he touched one lightly, as
though he chucked it under the chin;
he smiled" upon it then, but not as he
had smiled upon Miss Betty,' for thij
was his own, the smile that came when
he was alone; and. when it came, the
face was no longer joyous as it had
been In repose: there was an infinite
patience and worn tolerance â possibly
for himself. This incongruous and mel
ancholy" smile was astonishing; on*
looked for the laujrhter of a boy and
found, instead, a gentle, worldly, old
prelate.
Standing there. . all alone In the
moonlight, by the hedge, he lifted both
hands high and waved them toward the
house, as children wave to each other
across lawns at twilight. After that he
made a fantastic bow to his corrugated
shadow on the broad sidewalk.
J 'Again, you rogue!" he exclaimed
aloud. Then, as he faced about and be
gan to walk in the direction of the
beckoning violins: "I wonder If Tom's
kitten was better, after all!"
contention concerning her beauty and
&Â«r gift, of music, for a song can be
beard through an open window. And
how did it happen that Crailey Gray
knew that it was Miss Carewe's habit
to stroll in her garden for half an hour
or bo each evening before retiring, and
that she went to mass every morning
â¢oon after sunrise? Crailey Gray never
rose at or near sunrise in bis life,
thouch he sometimes beheld It from
another point of view â as the end of
the evening. It appears that some one
must have told him.
One night when the moon lay white
en the trees and housetops Miss Betty
psused in her evening promenade and
eeated herself upon a bench on the bor
ders of the garden, "touched," as 'the
books .of the time would have put it,
"by the sweet tranquillity of the
â¢tene," and wrought upon by the ten*
dÂ«^r incentive to sighs and melancholy
which youth in loneliness finds in a
loveliness of the earth. The breeze
bore the smells of the old-fashioned
garden, of violets and cherry blossoms,
and a sound of distant violins came on
the air playing the new song from th*
cew opera.
â¢ But I also ireatr.t. which pleased me meat.
That you loved me JuÂ«t the Â«aroe
They sang, and v.ith the lilt of them
end the keen beauty of the night the
Inherited pain or the ages rose from
the deaths of the young girl's heart, so
that she thought it must break; for
what reason she could not have told,
â¢lnce she vras without care or sorrow
that she knew, except the French Revo
lution, yet tears shone upon the long
lashes. She shook them off and looked
up with a sudden odd consciousness.
The next second she sprang to her feet
with a gasp and a choked outcry, her
bands pressed to her breast.
Ten paces in front of her, a gap in
the shrubbery where tall trees rose left
a small radiant area of illumination
like that of a lime light in a theater,
Its brilliancy intensified by the dark
foliage behind. It was open to view
only from the bench by which she
stood, and appeared, indeed, like th*
stage of a little theater, a stage occu
pied by a bizarre figure. For. in the cen-
t ter of this shining patch, with the light
strong on his face, was standing a fair-
young man, dressed in a yellow
Â«oat. a^scarlet and white striped waist
coat, wearing a jauntily cocked black
hat on his head. And even to the last
detail, the ribbon laces above the ankle
â¢aid the gold- buckled shoes, he was the
Â¦ ketch cf Georges Meilhac sprang into
life..
At>out this slender figure there bung
a wan sweetness like a fine mist, al
most an ethereality in that light; yet
In ttie pale face lurked something reck
less,' something of the actor, too; and
though his smile was gentle and a wist
ful, there was a twinkle behind it, not
seen, at first, something amused and
Impish; a small surprise underneath,
like a fie a in a rose jar.
Fixed to the fcpot by this apparition,
MiF$ Betty stood wildly staring, her
â¢training eyelids showing the white
abov< and below the large brown iris.
Her. breath cameifaster and deeper, un
tji 'between her parted lips it became
"vpcal in a quick sound like a sob. At
that he sooke.
"F.orgive me!" The voice was low. vi
brant, and so exceedingly musical that
he "might have been accused of coolly
selecting his best tone; and it became
only sweeter when, even more softly, in
a, semi-whisper of almost crucial plead
ing, -he said. "Ah â don't go away!**
.la trtith *>he could not go; she had
been too vitally stirred; she began to
J.remhie excessively, and sank back up
on the bench, motioning him away with
vasrue gestures of her shaking hands.
â¢ This, was more than the Incroyable
had counted upon, and far from his de
sires. He started forward with an ex
clamation.
"Don't come near me!" she gasped.
"Who are you? Go away!"
"Give me on<? second to explain," he
began: but with the instant reassur
ance of this beginning she cut him off
thort. her fears dispelled by his com
monplace. Nay, indignation displaced
them so quickly that she fairly flashed
up before him to her full height.
. "You did not come In by the gate!"
Â¦he cried. "What do you mean by com
{r.r here In that dress? What right havt
you in my garden?"
. "Just one word." he begged quickly,
but very gently. "You'd allow a street
beggar that much!"
â¢ She stood before him, panting, and,
eg he thought, glorious, in her flush of
*etith and anger. Tom Vanrevel had
painted heY incoherently, but richly, in
epite ot that, his whole heart being in
the portrait: and Crailey Gray had
â¢mUed at what he deemed the exagger
ation of an ordinarily unimpressionable
man who had fajlen in love "at first
sirht;" jret,"ln the presence of the real
ity, tb* Incroyable decided that Tom's
colors had been gray and humble. It
was. not that she was merely lovely,
that her nose was straight, and her
chin dexterously wrought between
â¢Snare and oval; that her dark hair lay
â¢oft as a shadow on her white brow;
not that the trembling hand she held
a fain tt her breast sprang from a taper
Trist and tapered again to the tips of
the long fingers: nor that she was of
that slenderness as Btrong as It is deli
cate: not all the exquisite regularity of
line and mold, nor simplicity of color,
rave her that significance which made
tfeft Incroyable declare to himself that
he stood for the first time in the pres
ence of beauty, and that now he knew
the women he had been wont to call
beautiful were but pretty. And yet her
beauty, he told himself, was the least of
her loveliness, for there was a glamour
about her. It was not only the richness
of her youth; but there was an ineffa
ble exhalation which seemed to be made
partly of light, partly of the very spirit
of her, and, oddly enough, partly of the
â¢cent of the little fan that hung by a
ribbon from her waist. This was a wo
man like a wine, he felt, there was a
bouquet.
In regard to th<Â» bouquet of the young
man himself, if he possessed one. it is
pertinent to relate that at this very in
stant the thought skipped across his
mind (like the hop of a flea In a rosÂ«
jar) that some day he might find the
moment when he could tell her the
truth about herselfâ with a half laugh
âand say: "The angels sent their ha
lves in a sandal- wood box to be made
Into a womanâ and it was you!"
"If you have anything to say for
yourself, say it quickly!" said Miss
Betty.
*T[ou were singing a while ago," he
answered, somewhat huskily, "and I
stopped on the street to listen; then- 1
came here to be nearer. The spell of
your voiceâ" He broke off abruptly to
change the word. "The spell of the
song came over meâ It Is my dearest
favoriteâ so that I etood afterward in
a sort of trance, only hearing apain, In
the silence. The stolen heart, like the
gathered rose, will bloom but a day!'
I did not see you until you came to the
bench.' You must believe me; I would
faces of the women and their fin* fur
belows, handsome men and tall, all so
gay. so cheerily smiling:, and yet so
earnest In their welcome to her. ' No
ohe,was afraid to "let out" his voice j
their song went full and strong over
the waking town, and when It was fin
ished the ball was over, too.
. .The veranda and the path to th*
gate became like tropic gardens. thÂ«
fair colors of the women's dresses, bal
looning in the early breeze, making
the place seem strewn with giant
blossoms. They all went away at th*
same time, those In carriages calling
farewells to each other and to th* lit
tle processions departing: on fobt la
different directions to homes near by.
The sound of the voices and laughter
drew away, slowly died out altogether,
and the silence of the street was
strange and unfamiliar to Betty. Sh*
went to the hedge and watched th*
musicians, who were the last to go,
until they passed from sight: Httle
black toilsome figures, carrying gro
tesque black, boxes. While sh* could
still see them. It seemed to her that
her ball was not quite over, and shÂ«
wished to hold the least speck of It as
long as she could: but when they had
disappeared she faced the truth with
a deep sigh: the long, glorious night
Â¦was finished Indeed.
What she needed now was another
girl; the two would have gone tÂ»
Betty's room and danced It all over
again until noon; but she had only her
father. She found him smoking a
Principe cigar upon the veranda, â¢Â»
she seated herself timidly, neverthe
less with a hopeful glance at him, on
the steps at his feet; and. as she did
so. he looked down upon her with
something more akin to geniality than
anything she had ever seen In his ey*
before. It was not geniality itself,
but might be third cousin to it In
deed, in his way, he was almost proud
of her,' though he had no wish to show
it. Since one was compelled to dis
play the fact that one possessed â¢>
grown daughter. It was well that ah*
be like this one.
They did not know each very well,
and she often doubted â¢ that they
would ever become intimate. There
was no sense of companionship for
either in the other; she had been una
ble-to break through hla perfunctory,
almost formal, manner with her:
therefore, because he encouraged no
affection in her. she felt none, and
wondered why, since he xras her fath
er. She was more curious about him
than interested, and, though she did
not know it, she was prepared to
Judge him â should; occasion arise
precisely as she would judge any other
mere acquaintance. This morning.
for the first time, she was conscious
of a sense of warmth and gratitude
toward him; the elaborate fashion in
which he had introduced her to his
friends made it appear possible that
he liked her; for he had forgotten
nothing, and to remember everything;
in this case was to be lavish, which
has often the appearance of gener
osity.
And yet there had been a lack;
some small thing she had missed.
though she was not entirely sure that
she identified it: but the lack had not
been in her father or in anything bÂ«
had done. Then, too, there was some
thing so unexpectedly human and
pleasant in his not going to bed at
once, but remaining to smoke on thÂ«
veranda at this hour, that she gav*
him credit for a little of her own ex
citement, innocently fancying that he,
also, might feel the need of a com
panion with whom to talk over th*
brilliant passages of the night. And
a moment ensued when she debated
taking his hand. She was too soon
glad that her intuition forbade th*
demonstration.
"It was all so beautiful, papa," s&*
said, timidly. "I have no way to tell
you how I thank you." >>â¢
"You may do that," ha replied,
evenly, with no unkindness, with no
kindness. f either, in the level of his
tone, "by never dancing again mor*
than twice with one man in one even
ing."
"I th'nk I should much prefer not.
myself," she returned, lifting her head
to face him gravely. "I believe if X
cared to dance more than once with
one. I should like to dance all of them
with him."-- v " il'^S'.Z -V
Mr. Carewe frowned. "I tnJst that
you discovered none last night whom
you wished to honor with your entlr*
programme?"
"No," she laughed: "not last night."
Her father tossed away his cigar
abruptly. "Is it too much to hope,"
he' Inquired, "that when you discover
a. gentleman with whom you desire to
waltz all night, you will omit to men
tion the fact to him?"
-There was a brief flash of her ey*
as she recalled her impulse to take his
hand, but she immediately looked at
him with such comDlete seriousness
that he feared bis irony had been
thrown away.
"1*11 remember not to mention IV*
she answered." 'Tll v tell htm you told
me not to."
-?*!â¢ think you may retire now," said
Mr." Carewe, sharply.
She rose from the steps, went to the
door, then turned at the, threshold.
"Were all your friends here, papa?"
"Do you think that every ninny who
gabbled in my house last night was
my friend?" he said, angrily. "There
was one friend of mine, Mrs. Tan
berry, who wasn't here, because she is
out of town; but I do not Imagine that
you are inquiring about women. Tea

idiot "who 'could afford a swallow

they were all here except two, and on*
of those is a fool, the other a knave."
"Can't I know the fool?" she asked,
eagerly.'

could, he expressed the wish-Mjuite as
loudlyâ "That this waltz might last for

That was the seventh time it : had

she made no comment: her partner's

earnestly, "it would be heaven to dance

Tennessee cotton, on Its way to Massa

there. beside huge mounds of raw wool
from Illinois, ready to be .fed to the
Rouen mill; dates and nuts from the
Caribbean Sea; lemons from groves of
the faraway tropics;- cigars from the
Antilles: tobacco from Virginia and
Kentucky; most precious of all. the
great granary of .the farmers' wheat
from the level fields at home; and all
the rich stores and the houses that held
them, as well as the wharves upon
which they had been landed, and the
steamers that brought them up the
Rouen River belonged to Robert Ca
rewe.
That it was 'her father's property
which was vimperiled attested to the
justification of Miss Betty in running
to a fire; and as she followed the crowd
into Main street, she felt a not un
pleasant proprietary jj Interest In the
spectacle^ Very opposite sensations
animated the breast of the man with
the trumpet, who was more acutely
conscious than any other that these
were Robert Carewe's possessions
which were burning so handsomely.
Nor was he the only one among the
firemen who ground his teeth over the
folly of the uniforms; for now they
could plainly see the ruin wrought, the
devastation threatened. The two up
per stories of the southernmost ware- .
house had swathed themselves In one
great flame; the building next on the
north, also of frame, was smoking
heavily; and there was a wind from
the southwest, which, continuing with
the fire unchecked, threatened the
town. itself. There was work for the
volunteer brigade that night.
"They came down Main street with a
rush, the Tgure of their chief swaying
over, them on his high perch, while
their shouting was drowned In the
louder roar of greeting from the crqwd.
into which they plunged as a diver Into
the water, swirls and eddies of peo
ple marking the wake. A moment later
a section of the roof of the burning
warehouse fell in, with a sonorous and
reverberating crash.
The engine company ran the force ' I
pump out to the end of one of the low
wharves; two lines of pipe were at
tached; two rows of men mounted the
planks for the pumpers, andr at the
word of command, began the up and
down of the hand machine with ad
mirable vim. Nothing happened: the
water did not come: something ap
peared to be wrong with the mechan
ism. As every one felt the crucial need
of haste, nothing could have been more
natural than that all the members of
the engine company should simultane
ously endeavor to repair the defect; $
therefore ensued upon the spot a spe
cies of riot "which put the engine out of
Its sphere of usefulness.
In the meantime fifty or sixty men
and boys~ who ran with the machine,
but who had no place in their, opera
tion, being the bucket brigade, had
formed a line and were throwing large
pails of water In the general direction
of the southernmost warehouse, which
It was now impossible , to save; while
the gentlemen of the hook and ladder
company, abandoning their wagons,
and armed with axes, heroically as
saulted the big door of the granary, the
second building, whence they were
driven by the exasperated chief, who
informed them that the only way to
save the wheat was to save the build
ing. Crailey Gray, one of the berated
axemen, remained by the shattered
door after the others had gone, and.
struck by a suden thought, set his hand
upon the iron latch and opened the door
by this simple process. It was not
locked. Crailey leaned against the
casement and laughed with his whole
soSl and body.
Meanwhile, .by dint of shouting In
men's ears when near them, through
the trumpet when distant, tearing axes
from their hands, Imperiously gesticu
lating to subordinate commanders, and
lingering In no one spot for more than a
second. Mr. Vanrevel reduced his forces
to a semblance of order In a remarka
bly short, time, the confu
sion Into which they had fallen.
â¢ The space between the burning ware
house and that next it was not more
than fifty feet in width, but fifty feet
so hot no one took thought of entering ,
there; an "area as discomforting in ap
pearance as It was beautiful with the
thick rain of sparks and firebrands that
fell upon it. But the chief had decided
that this space must be occupied, and
more; must be held, since It was the
only point of defense for the second
warehouse. The roof of this building
would burn, which would mean the de
struction of the warehouse, unless It
could be mounted, because the streams
of water could. not play upon it from
the ground, nor, from the ladders, do
much more than t. -t the projecting .
eaves. Tt was a gable roof, the eaves
twenty' feet lower on the south side
than on the north, where the ladders
could not hope to reach them. Vanrevel
swung his line of bucketeers round to .
throw water, not upon the flames, but
upon the ladder men.
Miss Carewe stood in the crowd upon
the apposite side if the broad street.
Even there her cheeks* were uncom
fortably hot, and sometimes she had to
brush a spark from her shoulder,
though she was too much excited to
mind this. She was watching the beau
tiful fiery furnace between the north
wall of the burning warehouse and the
south wall of its neighbor, the fifty feet
brilliant and misty with vaporous rose
color, dotted with the myriad red stars,
her eyes shining with the reflection of
their fierce beauty. She saw how the
vapors moved there, like men walking
in- fire, and she was vaguely recalling
Shadrach. Meshach, and Abednego.
when, over the silhouetted heads of the
crowd before her. a long' black ladder
rose, wobbled, tilted crazily, then lame
ly advanced and ranged itself against
the south /wall of the second warehouse,
its top rung striking ten feet sho^t of
the eaves. â¢JShe hoped that no one had
any notion of mounting that ladder.

. : t CHAPTER V.
NERO NOT THE LAST VIOLINIST
; OF HIS KIND. .. ;â¢Â¦";
, Miss Carewe was at her desk writ
ing to Sister Cecilia, whom she most
loved of all the world, when .the bells
startled her with their sudden clangor.
The quill dropped from her band; she
started to her feet, wide-eyed, not un
derstanding; while the whole town,
drowsing peacefully a moment ago,-re
sounded immediately with a loud con
fusion.'- She ran to the front door and
looked out, herjheart. beating wildly. "
/The western Sky was touched with a
soft rose color, which quickly became
a warm glow, fluctuated, and, in the in
stant, shot up like the coming of a full
Aurora. Then through the broken foli
age, of the tree tops could <be seen the
orange curls of flames, three quarters
of a mile away'though they were.
â¢ People calling loudly that "it was Ca
rewe's warehouses," were running down
the street. From the stable, old Nel
son, on her father's best horse, came
galloping, and seeing the white figure
in the doorway, cried out in a quaver-'
Ing voice, without checking his steed:
"I goin' tell yo* pa, Miss Betty; he in
de kentry on Ian' bus'ness. Go back in
de, house. Missy!"
.The other servants, like ragged
sketches In the night, flitted by, with
excited ejaculations. , to Jpin the run
ners, and Miss Betty followed them
across the dew-strewn turf in her light
slippers, but at the gate she stopped,-
From up the street came the sound of
a bell , smaller thar? those of the
churches and court house, yet one that
outdid all others In the madness of Its
appeal to clear the way. It was borne
along, by what seemed, at first an in
definite black mass, but which â as the
Aurora grew keener, produced even
here a faint, yellow twilightâ resolved
Itself into a mob of hoarsely shouting
men and boys, who were running and
tugging at ropes, which drew along
three extraordinary vehicles. They
came rapidly .down the street and
passed Miss Betty with a hubbub and
din beyond all understanding; one line
of men; most of them in red shirts and
oil-cloth helmets, at a dead run with
the 'hose cart; a second line with the
hand engine; the third dragging the
ladder wagon. One man was riding, a
tall, straight gentleman in evening
clothes, and without a hat, w"ho stood
precariously in the hose cart, calling In
an annoyed tone through a brazen trum
pet. Miss -Betty recognized him at
once; it was he who caught her kitten;
and she thought that if she had been
Fauchon Bareaud she must have
screamed a warning, for his balance
appeared a thing of mere luck, and, if
he fell, he would be trampled under
foot and probably run over by the en
gine. But,' happily â¢ (she remembered)
she was not Fanchon Bareaud!
behind,, and beside the de
partment, raced a throng of boys, wild
with the Joy experienced by their spe
cies when property Is being handsomely
destroyed; after them came panting
women, holding their; sides and gasping
with the. effort to keep up .with the fly-
Ing- procession.
I Miss Betty trembled, for she had
never seen the like in her life; she stood
close, to the hedge and let them go by;
then she turned in after them and ran
like a fleet young deer. She was going
to the fire.
. Over all the uproar could be heard
the angry' voice through the trumpet,
calling -the turns of the streets to the
men in the van, upbraiding them and
those of the other two companies Im
partially; and few of his hearers de
nied th* 1 ! chief his rleht to express
some chagrin; since the. department,
(organized a half year, hard drilled,
and this its first fire worth the name)
was late on account, of the refusal of
the members to move until they had
donned their new uniforms; for the
uniforms had arrived from Philadel
phia two months ago, and to-night of
fered the first opportunity to display
them # in public. ., '
"Hail ' Vanrevel!" panted Tapping
ham Marsh to Eugene Madrillon. as the
two, running in the van of the hose
company, splattered through a mud
puddle., "You'd think he was Carewe's
only son and heir- Instead of his worst
enemy. Hark to the man!"
: "I.'d:let it burn, if I were he," re
turned the other.
- "It was all Cralley's fault," said Tap
pingham. swinging an arm free to wipe
the Bpattered mud from his face. "He
swore he wouldn't budge, without his
uniform, and the rest only, backed him
up; that was all. , Crailey and Carewe
could better afford to lose his shanties
than the overworked department its
first chance to look beautiful and earn
est Tom asked him why he didn't
send for a fiddle," Marsh finished with
a chuckle.
"Carewe might afford to lose a little,
even a warehouse or two, If only out of
what he's 'taken from Crailey and the
rest! of us, these three years!" \
/".Taken from Vanrevel, you mean.
Who doesn't know where Crailey's â
Here's Main street: look out for the
turn!"
. They swung out of the thick shadows
of Carewe "street Into full view of the
fire/and the:* faces were illuminated as
by sunrise.
Â¦ The warehouses stood on jthe river
bank, at the foot of the street, just
south of the new covered bridge. , There
were four â¢ of, them, huge, bare;-sided
- buildings; the two nearer the bridge of
.brick.' the" others of wood, and all of
them rich with stores of every kind of
river merchandise and costly freight;
furniture that had voyaged from New
England down thelong coast, across
the Mexican eulf^ through the flat Delta
and had made 'the winding Journey up
the great river a thousand miles, and
almost a thousand more, following the
greater and lesser tributaries; cloth
from Connecticut that had been sold In
Philadelphia, then carried ever moun
tains and through forests, by steam,
by, canal, by stage, and six-mule freight
wagons, to Pittsburg, . down the Ohio.
she .was Astonished (and she; was
mightily astonished) to find her* be
trothed ; developing a.', taste for her 'so
ciety alone.;- Formerly, she had counted
upon the gayeties of her home to keep
Crailey near her; now, however,~he told
her tenderly he wished to have her all
to himself. This was not like him, but
Fanch,on did not, question; and it was
very sweet \ to her that- he began to
makcl't. bis-custom to Â«ome in by a
side gate and meet: her. under an apple
tree in the dusk, / where they would sjt
quietly through tho evening,'
listening to the noise and laughter from>
the:lighted;house. - 'Â¦/â¢': '
That house was the most hospitable
in Rouen. Always cheerfully "full of
company," as they said, it was the sort
of house where a carpet dance could be
arranged in half an hour; a house with"
a sideboard like the widow's cruse; the,
young men always found /more. Mrs. =

dealt with nectar and ambrosia, and
grew fit to pander to Olympus, learn
ing of their mistress secrets to make
the ill-disposed as genial gods ere they
departed. Mr. Bareaud at fifty had
lived so well that he gave up walking,
which did not troublehim; but at sixty
he gave up '. dancing, which /did jj trouble
him. : His only, hdpe, he declared, was
in Crailey Gray's promise to invent for
him a concave partner. ..
Â¦ There was a thin, quizzing shank of a
son. Jefferson, who lived upon quinine,
ague and deviltry; , and' there were "the
two daughters, j Fanchon. and Virginia.
The latter was -three years older than
Fanchon, as. dark as Farichon was fair,
though not nearly so pr-tty; a small,
good-natured, romping sprite of a girl,
who had handed down the heart and;
hand of .Crailey Gray to her sister with
the b st rrace iri; 'the -world. For she
had been the heroine of one of Mr.
Gray's, half dozen or so most serious
affairs, and, after a furious rivalry with
Me.- Carewe, the victory was generally
conceded to- Crailey.. His triumph had
been about a fortnight's duration when
Fanchon returned from St. Mary's: ,
and, with the' advent of the youngeV
sister.'th/e " ' - who had decided that
Crailey was the incomparable she had
dreamed, of since Infancy, was gener
ously, alowed to discover that he was
not that visionâ that she. had fallen In
love with her own Idea of him; whereas
Fanchon cared only that he be Crailey
Gray, whatever kind of vision that was.
And Fanchon discovered that it was a
great many kinds. V -â¢
â¢ The ; transfer was made comfortably
with inlce judgment of a respectable
interregnum, and to the greater happi
ness of each of the three young people;
no objection, .lsuing from the easy
going parents, who were devotedly fond
of Crailey," while the town laughed and
said jrt~ was only that absurd Crailey
Gray./again. He and Virginia were the
best .of friends, and accepted their new
relation 'with a . preposterous lack o'f
embarrassment. > p
To be*, in love with Crailey became
Fanchon's vocation; ' she /spent all her
time at' It, and produced a blurred ef
fect upon . Btrangers. The > only man
with, whom she seemed; quite alive was
Vanrevel; a- ; little T because Tom
talked of Crailey: and a great deal
because she could talk of Crailey
to Torn: could tell him freely,
as* she '. could tell no '.one elseX how
wonderful. Crailey was. and explain to
him her lover's vagaries on the ground
that It was a necessity of geniuses to
be unlike the less gifted!' Nor was she
alone in suspecting' Mr. Gray of genius;
in the first place, he was so odd; in the
second, his poems were "already at
tracting more than. local attention," as
the Journal remarked," generously, for
Crailey had ceased, to present his
rhymes to that valuable paper. Ay!
Boston, no less, was his mart.
He was, rather -radical In his literary
preferences, and hurt the elder Cheno
weth's feelings by laughing, heartily at
some T-oems of .the $ late Lord Byron ;
offended many people by disliking the
style of Sir Edward Bulwer, and even
refused to admit that James. Fenimore
Cooper was the greatest : novelist that
ever lived. | But these things were as
nothing compared with his unpatriotic
defense of Charles Dickens. Many
Americans had fallen into a great rage
over the. vivacious assault upon . the
United States V In Martin Chuzzlewlt;
nevertheless, Crailey still boldly hailed
h.m. (as every/ one had * heretofore
asreed) the most dexterous .writer of
his 'C*y and the most notable humorist
of any/day..: Of course the Englishman
had not visited and thoroughly studied
such a city as Rouen, Crailey confessed,
twinkllngly; but, 5 * after all, wasn't there
some truth in Martin Chuzzlewlt?. Mr.
Dickens might have, been far from a
clear understanding of our people; but
didn't It argue a pretty ticklish vanity
In ourselves that we were so fiercely
resentfur of satire: and was not this
very heat over Martin Chuzzlewlt a
t '*Â» .flrmation of one of the, points the
book had presented against us? Gen
eral Trumble replied to this suggestion
with a personal. one' to /the effect that a
man capable of saying a good word for
so , ; monstrous a slander, ' that a man,
sir. capable of declaring, his. native
. country to be vain or sensitive ojught
to be horsewhipped, and at this Crailey
laughed consumedly.
; Trumble retorted with the names of
Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr. "And
If, if comes' to a war with these Greas
ers,*' he spluttered apoplectically, "and
it is coming, mighty, soon.* we'll find Mr/
Gray down^in" Mexico, -throwing mud
on the Stars. and Stripes and cheering
for. ' hat one-legged : ho. J % thief ; Santa
Anna! Anything to seek out something
foolish among your own people!" r .
.'-'Don't have to seek far, sometimes,
general," murmured j Crailey. from the
depths ; of the best chair/ in; the >club,
.whereupon Trumble; not trusting him
self, to answer, went out to the street.
And yet, before that" same^evening
was ; 'over, the general i had . shed honest'
tears of admiration and pity "for Crailey
Gray; and" Miss Betty saw heriIncroy
able again, 'for that night (thy second
chords on summer evenings, together,
_as ' young men will. Will Cummings,
editor of the Rouen Journal, was one
of these; a tall, sallow man, very thin,"
very awkward and .very gentle. ' Mr.
Cummings proved himself always
ready with a loud and friÂ«ndly r laugh
for the poorest joke in the. world, his
countenance shining with such kind
ness that no one ever had the heart to
reproach him. with /the evils of his
journalistic performances, or for ]Â¦ the
things he broke when- he, danced. An
other was Tappingham. Marsh, an ex
ceedingly , handsome , person, 'some
what languld^in appearance, [dainty, in
manner', with f ..women,', offhand with
men; almost as reckless as Crailey,
and often the '; latter'acompanion and
assistant -in dissipation.;. 1 .Young Fran
cis Chenoweth never: failed to follow
both into whatever/ they j planned; he
was short and pln^k;, and the uptilt = qf
his nose was : cohexent^with ; the ap
pealing earnestness which was habit
ual with him. c Eugene Madrillon was
the sixth of these Intimates; -a dark
man. whose j Latin ' eyes : and color, ad
vertised . his French ancestry as plain
ly as his emotionless mouth and lack
of gesture betrayed the Â¦ mingling* of
another strain. *Â¦
All these, and others of the town,
Â¦were wont to "talk politics" a. "great
â¢ deal at the little club on Main street,
and all. were -apt tp fall foulTof Tom
Vanrevel; or Crailey Gray before the
end of any discussion. For those were
the days when they twisted -the lion's
tall In vehement and bitter earnest;
when the eagle screamed In mixed
figures; when few men knew how to'
talk, and many orated; when party
strife was savagely personal; when in
tolerance was called the "pure fire of
patriotism"; v -when criticism ', of the
existing order of things surely in
curred j fiery anathema j and black In

wh/> dared to h'nt that his country,
as a whole and politically, did lack
some fwo or three 'particular virtues,
and that the first step toward obtain
ing them would b^ to help it to, real
ize their absence. 'â¢
S This latter point of view was, that
of the firm of Gray & Vanrevel, which
was a unit in such matters. Crailey
did most of the talking â quite beauti
fully, tooâ -and both had to stand
against odds in \mariy a sour argu
ment, fcr they were not only aboli
tionists/but opposed the attitude of
their country "in Its difficulty with
Mexico, and; . In* common with other
men of the time who took .their stand,
â¢ they had to grow accustomed to being
called disloyal traitors, foreign
toadies, malignants and traducers of
the flag. >Tom had Â¦ long been used to
epithets of this sort,", suffering their
v stlng in quiet, and was glad when he
could keep . Crailey out of worse em
ployment than standing firm . for an
unpopular belief. ;p
There was one place to which Van-,
revel, seeking his friend and partner,
when the latter did not' come home at
night, could not -go; this was the
tower chamber, and it was in that
mysterious apartment of the Carewe
cupola .that Crailey was apt to be
deeply occupied when he remained
away, until daylight. Strange as it ap
pears,; Mr. Gray 'maintained peculiar
relations of intimacy with" Robert
- Carewe, in spite of the feud between
Carewe and h's own best friend. * This
intimacy, Â¦â¢ which did not necessarily
Imply any mutual fondness (though
Crailey seemed to dislike nobody), was
betokened by a furtive understanding,
of a sort, between them. They held
brief, earnest conversations on /the
street, or in corners, when they met at
other people's houses, always speak
. ing in voices too low to be ove|heard;
and , they exercised a mysterious^ sym
bolism, somewhat in the manper of
fellow-members of a secret" jrociety;
they had been observed to communi
cate across crowded rooms, by lifted
eyebrow, nod of head, or a surrepti
tious turn of the wrist; so that those
who observed them knew that a ques
tion had been asked and answered.
It was noticed, also, that there were
five, other intimates to this masonry-
Eugene' Madrillon,.. the elder Cheno
weth, General Trumble, Tappingham
Marsh and Jefferson Bareaud. Thus,
on the afternoon following Miss
Betty's introduction. to Rouen's favo
rite sons and | daughters, Mr. Carewe,
driving down Main street, held up one
forefinger to Madrillon as he saw the
young man turning in' at the club.
Eugene . nodded' gravely, and, as he

with surprise, and stared incredulous

Miss Bareaud was even" happier than
the vision of the lookers-on in Rouen,
quiet . souls who hovered along ; the
walls at merry-makings and cheer
fully counted themselves spectators at
the play, Crailey Gray held the center
of the stage and was the chief come
dian of the place. Wit, poet and
scapegrace, the small society 'some
times seemed â¢ the mere background
set for his performances, spectacles
which he, also, enjoyed, and from the
beÂ«t seat in the house; for he -was not
content as the actor, but must be the
Prince *n the box as well.
His friendship for Tom Vanrevel
was, in a measure, that of the vine for
the oak. He was full of levities at
Tom's expense, which thÂ« other bore
with a grin of sympathetic compre
hension, ' or, at long intervals, re-:
turned upon Crailey with devastating
effect. -Vanrevel was the one steady-;
ing thing In his life, and, at the same
time, the only one of. the young men
upon whom he did not have an almost
mesmeric ""influence. In good truth,
Crailey was the ringleader in all the
devilries of the town. Many a youth
swore to avoid the roisterer's com
pany for all time, and, within two
hours of the vow, found himself, flag
on in hand, engaged in a bout that
would last the night, with Mr. Gray
out-bumpering the hardiest, at the
head of the table. And, the next
morning, the fevered, scarlet-eyed
perjurer might creep shaking to v hi8
wretched tasks, only to behold the
cause of his folly and headache trip
ping merrily along the street, smiling,
clean shaven, and fresh as a dew-born
primrose, with, perchance, two or
three of the prettiest girls in town at
his elbow to greet his sallies with ap
proving laughter.
Crailey haJ been so long in the
habit of following every impulse, no
matter how mad, that he enjoyed an
almost perfect immunity from con
demnation, and, whatever his deeds,
Rouen had learned to say, with a
chuckle, that it was "only Crailey
Gray again." But his followers were
not so privileged. Thus, .when â¢ Mr.
Gray, who in his libations sometimes
developed the humor of an urchin,
went to the Pound at three in 'the
morning of New Year's day, hung
sleigh bells about the necks of the
cattle and drove them up and down
the streets, himself hideously blowing
a brass horn from the back of a big
brown steer, those roused from slum
ber ceased to rage, and accepted the
exploit as a rare joke, on learning
that it was "only Crailey Gray|'; but
the unfortunata young Chenoweth
was heavily frowned upon and prop
erly upbraided because he had fol
lowed in the wake of the bovine pro
cession, mildly attempting to play up
on a flage:let.
Crailey never denied a folly nor de
fended an escapade. The latter was
always done for him, because he
talked of his "graceless misdoings"
(so he was wont, smilingly, to call
them) over ups of tea in the after
noons with old ladfes, lamenting, in
his musical voice, the lack of female
relatives to guide him. He >was
charmingly attentive to the elderly wo
men, not from policy, but because his
manner was uncontrollably chival
rous; and, ever a gallant, listener,
were the speaker young, old, great or
humble, he never forgot to catch the
last words of a sentence^ and seldom
suffered for a reply, even when he
had drowsed through a question.
Moreover, no one ever heard him
speak a sullen word, nor saw him
wear a brow of depression. The sin
gle creed to which he was constant
was that of good, cheer; he was the
very apostle of gayety, preaching it In
parlor and bar; and made merry
friends with battered tramps and
homeless dogs In the streets at night.
Now and then he would spend sev
eral days in the offices of Gray & Van
revel, attorneys and counselors-at
law, wearing an air of unassailable
virtue; though he did not far/ over
state the case when he said,"Tom does
all the work and gives me all Ahe
money not to bother him when he's
getting up' a case."
The working member of the" firm
got up cases to notable effect, and few
lawyers, in .the State enjoyed having
Tom Vanrevel on the other side. There
was nothing about him of the floridity
prevalent at that time; he withered
"oratory" before the court: he was
the fpe of jury pathos; and, despising
noise and the habitual voice dip at
. the end of a sentence, was, neverthe
less, at times an almost 'fearfully ef
fective orator. So by degrees the
firm of Gray & Vanrevel, young as it
was, and in spite of the idle appren
tice, had grown to be the most pros
perous in the district. For this emi
nence Crailey was never accused of
assuming the credit Nor did he ever
miss an opportunity of making known
how much he owed to his partner.
What he. owed, in brief,' was every
thing. How well Vanrevel worked
was demonstrated every day, but how
hard he worked, only Crailey knew.
The latter had grown to depend upon
him for even his political beliefs, and
lightly followed his partner into aboli
tionism; though that was 'to rsk un
popularity, bitter" hatred, and worse^
Fortunately, on certain occasions,
Vanrevel had made himself (if hot his
creed) respected, at least so far that
there was no longer danger of mob
violence for an Abolitionist in Rouen.'
He was a cool-headed young man;or
dinarily, ', and possessed of an elusive
forcefulness not to be trifled with,
though he was a quiet man, and had
what they called . a "fine manner."
And, not in the latter, but In his dress,
there , was an eclio of the beau, r wtiich
afforded Mr. Gray a point Â¦ of attack
for sallies of wit; there was a touch of
the dandy about Vanrevel; he had a
large and versatile* wardrobe, and, his
clothes always fit him not only in line
but in color; ; even women saw how
nobly they were fashioned.
These two _ young men were "mem
bers of a cheerful band, who feasted,
laughed, wrangled over . politics,
danced, made love, and sang terrible
to present him to my daughter. The
quarrel between us â " Mr.' Caxewe
broke off for a moment, his hands
clinching the arms of his chair, while
he swallowed with difficulty, as though
he choked upon some acrid bolus, and
he was 80 strongly agitated by his own
mention of his enemy that he con
trolled himself by a painful effort of
his wllL "The Quarrel between us is
political â and personal. You will re
member."
"I shall remember," she answered
In a rather frightened voice.
â¢ â¢ â¢ It was long before â¢ she fell
asleep. "I alone must hover
about the rates or steal Into
your garden like a thief," the
Incroyable had said. "The last
time I spoke to him it was to tell him
that If he ever set foot on ground of
mine, I'd shoot him down!" had been
her father's declaration. And Mr.
Carewe had spoken with the most un
deniable air of meaning what he said.
Vet she knew that the Incroyable
would come again.
Also, with hot cheeks pressed Into
her pillow. Miss Betty had identified
the young man in the white hat, that
dark person whose hand she had far
too impetuously seized in both of hers.
Aha! It was this gentleman who
looked Into people's eyes and stam
mered so sincerely over a pretty
speech that you almost believed him;
it was he who was to marry Fanchon
Bareaud â "if he remembers!" No
wonder Fanchon had been In such a
hurry to get him, away. "If he re
members!" Such was that young
man's character, was it? Miss Carewe
laughed aloud to her pillow; for was
one to guess the reason, also, of his
not having come to her ball? Had the
poor man been commanded to be "out
of town?"
Then remembering the piquant and
generous face of Fanchon, Betty
clinched her fingers tightly and
crushed the imp who had suggested
the unworthy thought, crushed him
to a wretched pulp and threw
him out of the open window. He im
mediately sneaked in by the back way,
for. In spite of her victory, she still
felt a little sorry for poor Fanchon.
CHAPTER IV.
"BUT SPARE YOUR COUNTRY'S
FLAG."
If It be true that love Is the great
Incentive to the useless arts, the num
ber of gentlemen who became poets
for the sake of Miss Betty Carewe
need not be considered extraordinary.
Of all that was written of her danc
ing, Tom Vanrevel's lines, "I Danced
with Her Beneath the Lights" (which
he certainly had not done when he
wrote them) were, perhaps, next to
Crailey Gray's in merit, though Tom
burned his rhymes after reading them
to Crailey. Other troubadours were
not so modest, and the Rouen Journal
found no lack of tuneful offering, that
spring, generously printing all of it,
even at the period when it became ep
idemic. The public had little difficul
ty in recognizing the' work of Mr.
Francis Chenoweth in an anonymous
"Sonnet" (of twenty - three lines)
which appeared in the issue fol
lowing Miss Carewe's debut. Mr.
Chenoweth wrote that while
â¢lancing the mazourka with a
lovely being, the sweetest feelings of
his soul, in a celestial stream, bore
him away beyond control, in a ser
aphic dream; and he untruthfully
stated that at the same time he saw
her wipe the silent tear, omitting,
however, to venture any explanation
of the cause of her emotion. Old
General Trumble boldly signed his
poem in fulL It was called "An Ode
Upon Miss C â 's Waltzing," and it
began:
When Bfttira found fair Rouen' Â¦ ihore,
And her aced father to us bore
Her from the cloister neat.
She waltzed upon the ballroom floor.
And lightly twirled upon her feet.
Mr. Carewe was rightfully Indig
nant, and refused to acknowledge the
general's salutation at . their next
meeting; Trumble was fifteen years
older than he.
As Crailey Gray never danced with
Miss Carewe, it Is somewhat singular
that she should have been, the
inspiration of his swinging verses
in waltz measure, "Heart Strings
on a Violin,"** the sense of
which was that when a violin
had played for her dancing, the in
strument should be shattered as wine
glasses are after a great toast. How
ever, no one, except the author him
self, knew that Betty was the subject;
for Crailey centainly did not mention
it to Miss Bareaud, nor to his best
friend, VanreveL
It was to some degree a strange com
radeship between these two young
men; their tastes led them so often in
opposite directions. They had rooms
together over their offices in the Ma
drlllon block, on Main street, and the
lights ehone late from their windows
every night in the year. Sometimes
that would mean only that the â¢ two
friends were talking, for they never
reached a silent intimacy, but, even
after several years of companionship,
were rarely seen together when not In
interested, iften eager, conversation,
so that people wondered what In the
world they, still found to say to each
other. But many a night the late
shining lamp meant that Tom sat
alone, with a brief or a book, or
wooed the lorn hours with his magical
Rultar. For he never went to bed un
til the other came home. And if day
light came without Crailey, Vanrevel
would go out, yawning mightily, to
look for him; and when there was no
finding him, Tom would come back,
sleepless, to the day's work.
Crailey was called "peculiar." and
he explained, with a kind of jovial
helplessness, that he was always pre
pared for the unexpected in himself,
nor did such a view detract from his
picturesqueness to his own perusal of
himself; though it was not only to
himself that he was Interesting. .To

platform, and yet thirty feet away, the
girl acknowledged to herself that his
features were good and ; that his Â¦ face
showed character and ambition. Per
haps it was for these reasons that while
he was covering the other thirty feet
Miss Bessie suddenly decided that he
ought to be snubbed.

asked Miss Bessie, as she tarned to

* "Well, no," he slowly replied.
That was what the boys would have
called a settler, and it hung the young
man up for the next ten minutes.
When he spoke again,. however, lt was
as if nothing had happened.

quietly said, as he pointed with ' his
whip "that four of our men were sur

Miss Bessie, deliberately turned to

felt that he was smiling as he contln
"One of the boys* was killed, but they
killed- twelve Indians and held their

the whole four cowboys were killed?

HER LESSON
By H. B. Lewis
The girl gave an unconcerned shrug
'to hide the suffocating beating of her
beirt in her throat It was terrible to
her, the suggestion of domesticity in

Royce flung down his pen, and jumped
up. And it was not her hand that he^

like that for always, Luce."
The girl's face quivered with happi
ness. She made a little involuntary
swaying movement toward him. Still
holding her arms, as though he feared
she might slip away from him, Royce
drew her within his own.

There was no mistaking his meaning
now. Lucy swayed a little, with part
ed, breathless lips, putting; out one
hand to steady herself .against .the
desk.
Royce's hold slipped from her shoul
ders to her arms and tightened there.
"Don't say you< care for him, Luce,*'
he pleaded. ,.;.- ,' Â¦
The girl's throat ached with her
longing to comfort him, but the words
would not come. .
"And how am I going to stand lt if
that empty-headed cad that you went
driving with this afternoon gets what 1
want more than 'anything else in the
world?" His voice was rasping In. its
anxiety.
How pretty she had looked sitting
there in the flre*light! What could she
see in that empty-headed numskull that
she should care to go driving with him?
Was she, after all, one of the girls to
whom a well-weighted pocketbook
atoned for any mental lack?
He recalled the evening before when
after a hard day's work he had wan
dered into the drawing-room where
Lucy sat playing a sweet, illusive little
melody of Chaminade's. Again the
feeling of supreme content in being thus
alone with her, with no words between
them but the soft tender chords, came
over him. Suppose this tailor's block
of a man- should carry her off to a
home of his own? Suppose she should
be willing to go? He got up and paced
through the rooms, his mind in a whirl
of fear.
He met the girl in the hall when she
returned, her face bright and glowing
from her drive.
"Well, how roes It?" Bhe asked
cheerily. .- â> :
"How goes what?" His eyes were
fixed gloomily on her face. He grudged
the fact that another man had been
able to look at her for the past hour
unrestrained.
"Why, the professor and his germ
quest, of course." | â¢
, "Oh. it's in the waste paper basketâ
the only fitting place for it"
She glanced up, surprised at the bit
terness of his tone, and moving swiftly
away from him into the "den," stood
bending over his desk.
Royce followed, and laying his hands
firmly on her shoulders, turned her
about until she faced him.
"Look here," he demanded, . "what's
the use of my making an imaginary
professor look for a thing which I've
found myselfâ or, rather, which has
found me?"
She stared at him in open-eyed be
wilderment backing slightly from what
Ehe saw In his face.*
Having finished the professor's solilo
quy he rose and strode into the draw
ing-room Just in time to see Lucy being
helped into a high dogcart by a fair
faced individual in immaculate light
overcoat and <iogskin gloves. The horses
pawed the air when the diminutive tiger
left their heads and sprang into his
place. Royce had a glimpse of Lucy's
bright, face as it was lifted to her com
panion's. How entirely in her element
ehe looked! He turned away from the
window, his foot Â» tripping In a rug,
which he kicked savagely back Into
place. Confound those things that are
always catching in people's feet! Well,
here was another day wasted. That
stuff he had written was rot. He strode
back into his room and tearing the
sheets in two flung them mto the waste
paper basket. Then he threw himself
wearily Into the chair which the girl he
called cousin, because he had known
her all his life, though the tie between
them was remote, had so lately occu
pied.
R^yce was deep in his work again,
scarcely conscious of the fact when she
rose and left the room in answer to a
ring at the bell and the maid's knock.
He heard the soft pat-pat of her feet as
she ran upstairs a few minutes later,
and then the clash of the front door.
"The man â I â well, if* some onÂ«

been away all summer. He â he lives

"Oh!"
"You do know him then?"
"I've heard of him." said he. cir
cumspectly.
"He's my ideal." explained Dolly
with a charming blush.
"He certainly Isn't the sort of fel
low you would have marriedâ once."
"How do you know that? You said
you had merely heard of him."
"Yo'ur requirements were pretty
Ironclad."
"I told you, did I not, that I had
modified them?"
Sanford stared at her quizzically
for & moment . "You also told me
that you never wouldâ that there was
no oneâ" Â»
"I've changed my mind." snapped
Dolly; "that's the prerogative of wise
men â and women."
Sanford rose slowly from his chair
and stood for a second at the back of
hers, looking down at the silk rumple
of sun-blond hair.
"You haven't exactly set the day
yet. dear," he ventured mildly.
"And pray how do you know that,
Mr.; Sanford?"
"At lepst, I have received no letter."
He bent his head to the mutinous rose
face, then lifted it suddenly.
"What is your ideal. Dolly V he
asked, curiously.
"A roan -who Is a rea! man," aald
she softly, "one who would do any
thingâall things in tne great round
world to win the girl he loresâ who
would even go so far as to get some
other Person to write his letters, for
getting to disguise his little tricks of
expression â whoâ"
"At least," he broke In, "I didn't

studied shorthand together that â "

her half-averted profile. \ > â¢ : .
"Don't be surprised*" he answered
presently, "but â I'm jroingr to ba

A long silence ensued. When Dolly
looked toward him again there were
tear-traces in her eyes. She hell out
her hand.
"Let me congratulate you, won't
you?" Her voice was studiedly low,
to hide its meaning. "Who la theâ
the lucky girl, Billy?"
"The woman I love." ' ha replied
sententiously, drawing her fingers
into both hi3 hands and holding them
close.
Dolly flushed, snatching them away
sharply.
"Don't!" she cried. "If* â if* meaa
of you!"
"By the way, Dolly," asked San
ford, "what are you going to New
York for?"
She regarded him narrowly for an
instant through contracted lids.
"Why, I'm going to be married,
too," she returned with a wee laugh.
"And it's a â a sort of disgrace. Bil
ly," she hurried on. "I've half a
mind to tell you the truth about It"
"Do." vV:v.i
."And may I ask â you would not
mind telling me whether you are any
nearer the â whether you have

a shadow of dwindling hope across his
face. . .. '
"Not an Iota nearer," she cut. In
with. some abruptness.
Sanford smoked complacently for
several seconds. The sun dropped
steadily, in the West,. casting a weird,
copper glow over the thin, keen,, ex
pressive /face. Dolly watched him
furtively, for.' a little, her gaze gradu
ally, shifting to the great plunging
emerald columns of sea-water, scatter
ing sheets of opal spray and filling the
airwith salt fragrance. â¢
-'.'What takes you to New .York, Wil

sudden assumption of casual interest
.Sanford did not at , "once reply. A
queer. little smlle*dey eloped about the
corners of his mouth as he looked at
"People learn by mistakes."
"But scarcely ever profit by them.

"I have somewhat modified my

"Ideals, of course."
Sanford smiled, a trifle enigmatlr: i
ly, and looked down at his strong, sea
tanned hands.
"Still in the quest of the ideal. I
see,'! he observed after a little, his
keen gray eyes shifting transiently
along the deck-rail.
"Â£o to Bpeak," acquiesced Dolly, fol
lowing his gaze.
"One might just aa well chase rain

clumsily Into his pocket \ for a cigar.
"May I?" he inquired politely.
Dolly nodded, catching her full low

ored teeth. "To Judge by your re

inflection of ire, "one would think that

the rush and swlrl'of water against

was, not unfamiliar there leaping

HIS AWAKENING
The letter, when she read it made
Hiss Purvis' face go all pink and
beautiful, and then pale, and her eyes
fill with tears. Then she put the letter
away in the' borDm of her gown, and
You see, Charles Augustus loved his
governess greatly. She came next to

he grew up, and had even talked over

VÂ«WEÂ£-Â£rCjtfjl enough. but had

Charles Augustus thought that was
the end of it But it was not For
as often as he looked up from his book
or slate, he saw Miss Purvis reading
the letter, and each time he saw tears
in her eyes.
What could it be in those Ecrawlj
blacks marks to make people cry?, He
cried when he w^s spanked or shut
up in a closet or had to do something
he did not want to â but this wasn't
like that Charles Augustus could not
understand this silent crying. When
he cried he wanted to let the whole
world know â and usually succeeded.
Later, when lessons were ' over, he
saw Miss Purvis, through the window,
writing a letter and she was cryinjj
over that Plainly, there was some
thing in this writing business which
was decidedly unpleasant Charles
Augustus decided then and there that
he would never write. Then when
she had finished she went off to the
village and would not let Charles Au
gustus go with her.
In that half hour of easy-time which
came when Charles Augustus had
shifted from his day things Into the
ample lengths of his flannel pajamas,
and, cuddled down into the big chair

with Miss Purvis, toasted, his- pink
toes before; the fire preparatory to go
ing . bedward, he came once niore
across ' this pe'culia/ [<.Â¦. thing -which he
could hot understand. For Miss.Pur
vis was strangely silent, only answer
ing a listless yes or no to, his observa
tionsXn life, and the curious "ways of
people, and - the' idiosyncrasies of r the
goat. She did not take much interest
even whence touched upon the many
things/he would give her when he be
came a man and they were married â
the rings like mamma's, and an . ex
press wagon, and a Jar , of ginger.
Though her anrTdrew.him close when
he told her j how much' he loved her,
yet Charles'! Augustus was not satis
fied. He felt-as though something in
visible were between them. - .
He put up a hand and turned her
face toward him. , â¢ V "
â¢> "You do love me, don't you?" he
said. ,, "And you will wait-for me until
I am big?"
She kissed him and told him "Yes"
âshe would always be his sweetheart
"But I'm afraid, dear, I'll have to go
away. Will you mind ?'' '
Charles Augustus minded very much
Charles Augustus saw the man that
afternoon. He had come to call, but
Miss: Purvis had excused herself. She
had a headache, she said. Now the
man, whose name was Mr. Houghton, t
"-There-was only, one man in Charles
Augustus' confidence, and he was very
big and strong and knew everything.
Next to the goat, who was -manifestly
inadequate under the circumstances,
Charles Augustus adored this man. H e
lived in a house by himself, a long,
long' way on! beyond ihe most distant
trees. - :. " '
Augustus had craftily tucked inside
his blouse, but yet she - was not the
Miss Purvis of aforetime; who laughed
and sang' and romped- on the lawn
with him. It was j not ' the mere pos
session of the letter then. What was
it? . - ;/' '0W&
."He must r.ot come." - "I must leave
here." Charles Augustus remembered
those words. Some one was coming
then; some one who'would carry Miss
Purvis, the beloved, away. Charles
Aogustus thought: of giants, and gyp
sies, and grew horriLly alive to the
exigencies of the occasion. His father
and mother were away, so he could
not go-to them for advice.
"No, it must â¢ not be!'.'; Charles Au
gustus heard her say. "They 'would
think it was for his money. It ieTibet
ter as it isâ better for him. - â¢, I must
leave here as soon as I can, and, oh,
I don't want to!" ...
Then Miss Purvis took the 'letter,
kissed it' and put it in a box on her
dressing tableâ a box with, curious
patterns in mother T of- pearl on it. and
with a queer lock that only she and
Charles Augustus knew how to open.
Charles Augustus' mind, started- to
work this thing out : This letter was
the cause of Miss Purvis' feeling
badly. It must be^ taken away, that
was nil about -it.: v Â¦Â¦
The room wasquiet, the flre died to
a little glow of : winking embers, . Miss
Purvis was asleep. Charles Augustus
got up and got the- leUer. . Then, he
hid It under the mattress, and went
to sleep with a lighter heart Now
Miss Purvis would be happy again and
she would not go, away.
â¢But the next day Miss Purvis was
not happy. True, she did not cry> nor
did she read the letter which Charles
and sa}d so," and the thought kepthim
awake lpng after he had got Into ;his
bed. Through "{the doonhe could see
Miss Purvis and- the "fire. Then he
saw her of a sudden bend forward,
her face in her arms, and hear her
sob. #
Though he wanted to comfort her,
something told Charles Augustus that
Miss Purvis , wanted to^bejlet^aione.
At last she raised a tear-stained face.

HE, SHE AND CHARLES AUGUSTUS
Miss Purvis looked at the man a
second, and then her face came all
pink â and then she said "Yes."
It was a very happy walk back
home to Charles Augustus, except that
he. for some reason, could not manage
to walk between his two friends and
hold both their hands at the same
time, a thing which Charles Augustus
particularly wished. A'Â« ';
â¢ -
I mean taked â away?" said Charles
Augustus.
"No, she isn't going away," the man
replied â "at least not very far."
They got out into the road and
started back, Charles Augustus' hand
in thai of his friend's, and his small
shoes plowing through the dust. And
then, at a turn in the road, they cams
suddenly on Miss Purvis, very white
and scared looking, and carrying
Charles Augustus* hat. . "Charlie."
she cried, "I thought you were lost!"
Charles Augustus plunged toward
her. "I tolded him!" he. cried trium
phantly. . "I've told him all about the
letter, and how you cried because the
giant was going to carry you off. and
he says the giant shan't, and that you
are going to live here happily ever
after, amen, like people do in fairy
stories. And you are, ain't you?"

It was not until after , the wedd'ng
in Paris. at; Eastertide that Katherine
had realized how the world, her world,
was smiling at her in polite amuse

Judgment of. them .had bred a vague,
mutual distrust, a fear born of love
and' pride Jthat'lthe; other, one might
give'eredence to 'the. world's rumor.
After that, the drifting apart had been
swift; : and the;, end : had â¢ co,me deliber

untangle it, but we can do the Alex

He had agreed to the separation too
readily, she thought. Even acknowl
edging perfect indifference on both
sides, a little* hesitancy would -have
been desirable. He had almost seemed
cheerful when he had asked her what
she intended doing at Berbec.
,'â¢< You haven't the ghost of a right
to. ask me," she had told him, "but
there is nothing to conceal. Martlgny
keeps up his summer' classes still. You
know I studied under him there and
in' Paris, too, when we were poor, be

with a light touch of bitterness, "be

"And be happy," concluded Hether

She felt that he could not : under
stand how she longed for the old. quiet
life away -from tAe world. It was at
Berbec he' had first met her. Young
and handsome, he had come to the
little fishing hamlet on a yachting
cruise, and. with all the confidence of
new ricnes, haa .expected to enter the
little exclusive art and social coterie
that gathered there. It had been, her
favor, that had won him the entree,

Â¦ For an Instant she hesitated, in thÂ«
revulsion of thought, then held out her
arms lovingly.
Â£he closed, her eyes and shrank closer
to him. Death had become a friend
to be met with smiling eyes and wel
coming happiness. As Hetherington
raised his head she waited, expectant

at him.
"How dear death Is torether," sh*
said softly. "I'm not one bit afraid."

hension and he stood back, loosening
her arms.
"The danger Is past," he said. "1

harbor at St. Hllaire. You can reach
Paris by evening."
It was Hetherington's voice. ShÂ©
turned the lock with steady fingers, a
sudden "peace strengthening her. HÂ»
paused in the doorway, tall and dark,
and storm-beaten in his dripping oil
skins, his face white and grim as h*
looked down at her.

went against his wishes he wonfd con
sider it final. Before she had fully
realized what It meant she had tossed
back her answer. It was final then.
She would go to Berbec. The follow
ing week they had sailed for France.
A sudden sharp rapping on her state
room door startled her. She caught
her breath as she ro3e unsteadily, and
clung for ! support to the side of the
berth. The moment of danger had
come, and they had sent for her. Not
Hetherington, she knew. Until she
called for him he would Tneet even
death without a word. But if she could
call, if there was only yet time, only a
moment of grace, to reach him and tell
him it was all a miserable mistake of
pride, that she loved him with all her
heart and wanted his presence with
her now. at the supreme moment when,
all the world had fallen away into
nothingness, and there was only, the
mystery of eternity before her, and his
love to bear her on. The rapping
sounded heavier and more imperative.
. If Hetherington , had been with her.
If^they. two could have faced eternity,
in each other's arms; with the old love
strengthening them, she would have
known no fear.' But as it was, a wild,
unreasoning, childish terror made her
tremble . at '. every crashing wave, and
she longed for even a sight of his fact

morning axd wondered if it were re
liable. It was not. AH day a warm
wind blew t'er.t!yÂ« from the south and
a' blue sky acd a hot sun emiled ge
nially.
Young Elton stared at the celling
for a good five minutes. Then he
went over to his desk with the mail
and straightway forgot all his troubles
in reading a dainty, scented note. She
said some very nice things to him,
and asked how he was faring in his
work,
Tfc* weather report failed to come
that night. Young Elton ' prepared
some slips of paper with various
Â¦weather conditions written on them,
and then drew one cautiously. It said:
"Rain to-day: colder."
"Xo, Â«ir," went on the telegraph,
editor. "I held the paper till 3 o'clock
waiting for it, but for some reason it
failed to come."
"Ah!" said the managing editor
again. Then his anger burst forth,
ad he raved as became a man who
held reporters and editors under his
thumb.
"I suppose," he concluded, sarcas
tically, "that it never occurred to you
to 'fake' a report: to realize that any
puess on the weather was better than
none; to appreciate the comments the
Times will male* on the incident; to
imagine the disappointment of every
one of our readers. Why. you fool,
do you suppose any one would have
known that your gruess was not a re
liable report, even if it differed from
that of the Times? Do you " He
stopped suddenly, turned on his heels,
and went out the door, with the re
mark:' "Don't let it happen again!"
"The weather report." said the latter,
with the air of excusing tlje bureau,
"did not come last night"
"Ah!" said the managing editor,
dryly.
The managing editor allowed his
steak to grow cold while he searched
the paper. But nowhere in it, from
the top of the first column on the front
page to the end of the last one on the
final page, could he find any comment!
on the weather. He folded the paper
deliberately. Bwearing softly to him
self, and fifteen minutes later he con
fronted Young Elton, the telegraph edi
tor.

\j&3j^fh. editor of the clay '
/^ vine News Â°i> ened his
X^f$\$f^ paper at breakfast
aWwiIIs one morning and
l^^SfejLÂ§) lÂ° oked for the wealh "
jfagpmmo^sak er report he found in
its place a modest notice stating that
the circulation of the News was the
largest of any paper in the city. Now
this fact was interesting to the man
aging editor, but it was not what he
wanted to read. He was looking for
the prophecy of the Weather Burean.
which was telegraphed each night from
a neighboring city.
It'a simple, you understand. I am
going to drop in and see you* for a min
ute or two each evening about dinner
time. If I may; and I shall gauge my
guesses by your demeanor. If you are
very cordial, I shall say the next day
will be clear. If you are not so glad to
see me. I 6hall prophesy cloudy weath
er. If I find you bored by my visits, the
report will say rain. Do you uiuler
Â¦tand?~ "
The Rirl did. and. though she sug
gested the possibility of fair, weather
every day, young Elton decided to try
the plan. He grinned cheerfully, and
went back to the office and wrote the
report: "Fair to-day, with southerly
winds." And although the Times
promised rain, the next day was cloud
less and warm.
It was very clear for a week, during
which time young Elton was called
upon to euess the weather -conditions
several times. The rival paper seemed
to be steadily wrong, and the manag
ing editor of the News took it upon
himself to write a little editorial on the
subject, reprinting the reports of the
two papers in parallel columns. The
reporters slapped young Elton on the
back, and told him he should try the
races. \
Then one night' something went awry
at the girl's house, i It was only a
trivial thine In itself, but Jt lowered the
spirits of both. The paper promised
cloudy weather, and all the next day
ugly, black clouds glowered.
The little quarrel was over by the
next night, but the conversation was
strained. A few evenings later, the girl
happened to mention another man, who
was not young Elton's idea of a fit com
panion for a woman. He said so very
frankly, and the girl disappeared.
The weather report read: "Rain to
day." For twenty-four hours the water
poured down unceasingly.
Late the next afternoon young Elton
sat at his desk thinking deeply.- He
had been out of sorts all day. and he
knew very well -where -the. trouble lay.
He looked at the clock \ thoughtfully,
and noted that it was nearly^ time. for
his calL He wondered whether it was
worth while to eo. ',' Â¦ Â¦ --M. ''^ Â¦' /
Suddenly he rose, slipped on mk rain
coat, and went out of the office. Â«There
was resolution In every movement.
"I've been a fool." he told himself; "a
poor, blind fool. The nicest girl in the
world almost mine â the nicest and pret
tiestâ"
The girl met him at the door., and in
vited him into the house, a bit unstead
ily, as if she did not quite understand.
Young Elton slipped, off his raincoat,
noted the paper on the table, with the
weather report wrinkled and. a little
tear stained, and began bravely.'
. "I've been a fool." he repeated to the
girl; "a poor, blind fool. If you will
only forgive me, I'llâ " i .. "*
t She cried a little, very softly, on his
shoulder, and then, with the prophesied
rain pattering- down outside., he slipped
a ring on her finger." and they fell to
talking of the something, when there
should be a little cottage, with ! a bit .of
green and maybe a dog.
When the managing editor took up
his paper the next morning he neglected
to scan the weather report until he had
read some- strong: editorials, which
struck, him as very, excellent. He
smiled complacently at -. the . forcible
words, and turned to the weather re
port. â¢ ' /v *VlJ r ,>-
His face grew very white..
"Southerly win'ds," he read, "and fair
weather -forevermora" â¢ â¢ -
Finally the family began to notice
her appearance. They declared that
a change of scene was what was need
ed. Then her mother decided that
California was the place for her, riot
knowing what reflections that country
would bring up.
Out on the Arizona plains the train
was drawn up on a siding* to permit
the eastbqund overland^to pass.. The
passengers on the westbound grum
bled at the delay, but Miriam slipped
off; the train to see if she could find
any subjects for her camera..
There was; a large group of cacti
beyond the switch and she trudged
down to get a good viewpoint just as
the belated train came speeding along -
She thought it would be a good clufnee
to try the speed of her camera by get
ting a snap shot of the moving train,
and stepping to one side of the track
held the little box In readiness.
But the anticipated snap shot was
never taken. There on the observation
platform of the car was Calvert, as

made no resistance. Â¦
' <WeI1^yÂ° u needn't have risked your
life Just to say you're glad to 'see me."
Â¦he said saucily, as soon as speech was
possible. He laughed.
"The train wasn't going fast enough

ment, and I didn't want to have to fol

Intelligent. It. couldn't make me more
appreciative. I promise you that from
now on . you will have no cause' for

There was a new tenderness In his
eyes, a new deference in his ; attitude
that proclaimed him the lover, not
merely the, old companion who took
everything for granted. SheVheld out
her hands with a happy smile. A,:
"I believe you. dear." she said softly.
_"but I Â«han't put ; you to the test. I'll
â¢accept the ,old proposal and take a

He caught her in his arms again; and
for : a moment' they were oblivious of
everything around :i them. ' Then he
looked j up -whimsically. Â¦ "I ; hope" the
walking's ; good." he said reflectively.
She gave a cry. There in the distance
\the westbound train wasfast. receding.
No one, had noticed her leave. the train
. or had observed Calvert. They had
simply gone on. . â¢ _

"We never will until you learn how

Infinite scorn In the voice.
Calvert blinded. He had known
Miriam ever since they had played
dolls together^ Even then they had
played at keeping house and had an
nounced to their parents that they
were going to be married shortly.
They had persisted long after the usual
course of boy and girl love affairs.
Miriam knew that he was not much
of a talker. Why should she expect
him to discover new ability simply be
cause he wanted to suggest that It was
time they. were married?'
,He rose to his feet and, regarded her
uncertainly. "I' think," he drawled,. "I
had better be going. I don't seem to
be any good here."
"Go." she said evenly, "and don't
you come back until you learn to 'tell
a woman that you love her as though

heard the door close and then burst
into 'tears.

There was .some comment _.that; Calvert
should. leave town in the' middle; of : the
season, but no one supposed that there
had been any trouble between*: Miriam
and him, and she was at Â¦ least . spared
the infliction \ot curious questions.

though he feared she would carry her
threat into execution, "Is that any

would think you had been brought up
in an atmosphere of personally con

â¢After elding a straight twelve : miles

her horse at the mouth of,: Wolf Pass.
It was a ravine, or gulch, 200 feet Ion?

was with her, as usual, and r he h^ld her

Beginning with the slowest of slow
coaches, traveling . over the worst of
roads, he introduces the reader. to Its
successors, better, and quicker coaches
running over improved roads; then to
the primitive tramway, with Its odd
carriages traversing wooden or flat iron
rails and propelled by horses: next to
the innovation of steam drawn car
riages and the steam railway. Steam
boats; were a natural outgrowth. of the
steam allway, tnd the telegraph, the
telephone, * the bicycle and the motor

the necessity for greater dispatch of
passengers and information. ,
The later, forms of fast vehicles, the

the determination of the individual. to

to enjoy swift travel wherever hls'In

prodigious development In extent and
adaptability to public, needs shown Ip

A San Francisco writer, Eugenia Kel
loger. has published a little book of
stories and sketches under the title of
"Poccallto, 'a Tale 1 of Telegraph '' Hill,"
which may well serve to while away an
idle half -hour. The fact that the anthor
prefaces the book with a recommenda
tion from Joaquin Miller and that she
graciously throws in her picture with
every copy sold does not make for an
additional value to the purchase. Joa
quln'e florid recommendations are too
common to be of value, and one should
not have tb know how the author looks
in order to appreciate her, writings. ,.
"Poccallto," the longest and the best
sketch of the. collection, Is, as Its sub
title denotes, a story of San Francisco's
Latin quarter. It purports to be. a page
from the life of a poor, misshapen little
fellow who is one of many in a crab
fisherman's family, and not blessed
with many joys of existence. The local
color Is well drawn, but the ending of
the tale Is too obviousâ too much of the
Little Nell type of ' pathos to . be effec
tive. Another fault which characterizes
this and the other tales oC the collection
lies In the author's too riotous use of
language. The evident attempt at
strength through the use of unusual
words and euphonious combinations re
sults in pronounced weakness.

OCCASIONALLY it befalls the
reader of many books to â¢ en
counter works which stagger
even his blase sense of critical appre
ciation. They defy classification; svt
at naught all attempts at an alignment
into this or that category: refuse to be
viewed from any of the accepted
standards of esthetic fitness. They are
wild, literary sporta of the sedate

ThÂ« character of. true literature has'
always been conservative. It ,has
rarely admitted ot . the presence of
books which . are . confessedly, self
serving or which bear all the ear
marks of being- revamped from ' old
material. Moreover it is 'especially
chary of books which have any radi
cal religious lesson to teach or -which
lean toward a new and violent scheme
of philosophy. Vrooman's book is
self-serving und of an outre religious
character; Varnum's - is . revamped
from philosophy as old 'as the'ever
lasting hills.
, Rev. Mr. Vrooman, who Is the presi
dent of a society known as the Federa
tion of Religions, has written his book
with an evident view to proselyting.-
In. fact he does not .hesitate to state
that if his propaganda, as expressed

reader, a life membership in the so
ciety may readily be obtained and that
a life privilege to support .the. society
with large or small contributions may
be encompassed wiCh equal facility.
It cannot be said that Rev ; Mr. Vroo- .

His heritage from Puritanism, hie

Woodberry. the Druid safe of early
verse. "The bills and ikies of Berk

the forest aisled it. and wherever ha
moved he was within the divine pre

Hawthorne, Longfellow and the rest of

â¢"They did not slight the American
material in th*lr age," says Woodberry
In defining this dependence of the
â¢tandard American authors upon Old
World thought, "rather they clung to
It with unhappy tenacity: but their
power to deal with itâ and this is a
more important because more compre
hensive debt than any obligation for
theme or atmosphereâ they obtained
from their education In the old human
ities. â¢ â¢ * This ancient and rich
literary past was the source of our
artlatio tradition and the seme of its
dignity and predousness wu always
great In the scholars among our wri
ters, and nearly all of them were schol
arly men. They lived habitually In It.
they learned from It, they emulated lti
works. In other words, they had the
academic mind. They were but par
tially naturalized even In the country
In which they were born; they were
sharers In the cosmopolitanism of the
modern world, and it waa forced oa
them by the state V Am/rican cul
ture."
Kot only does Woodberry maintain
that our American literature iÂ» of
grafted stock, but he shows that It*
unfortunate sectional character haa
done much to hinder a full fruition. The
moral and intellectual clefts In national
life have united acalnst a unity ot
spirit which might be productive of a
national literature. The South Is apa
thetic: the West Is yet too busy with
material things; geographical and
racial limitation* maintain everywhere
to the hurt of a unification of thought.
The years alone can overcome these
hindrances to a common ichool of let
ters.
Bryant, Irving, Cooper. Emerson.

. The " names of Calif omian writers
which have been upon the lips of liter
ary folk for the few years past have
been many. Though we are prone to
lay claim to the late Frank Norrls as
being a California renlus, his finishing
work at Harvard and subsequent at
tachment to an Eastern publishing
house divides the honor somewhat.
Jack- London, who has been at all times
a Califoraian. vis now the one upon
whom the West fixes its hopes most un
dK-idedly. Since he has broken from
the narrow bounds of Alaska and has
made the world h!s field it would ap
pear that his fame were destined stead-
out here bv the Golden Gate there
are native elements which are born into
the new world of literature such as are
nowhere else extant. First of all there
is the. virile, influence of the new land.
Po near, is the life In our State to the
elemental th'.rips cf a rugged nature,
so'littl? intrusion of the false veneer
of an older civilization has there been
that the strxneth of the primitive,
curbed only by the essence of a sen
tient culture, is ours. In this very
-bluff -a-nd ofttfmes Titanic nature
which surrounds us of the extreme
West there is a powerful Impulse
toward a unique and a forceful element
of Â«tren(tch in our literature. The deep
significance of the acre upon acre of
fructifying earth, such as Is so power
fully brought out by Norrls In "The
Octopus." the sweep of the splintered
Sierra, the very immenFity of the ever
blue vati'.t of the California n sky â
alliof thp?e forces inherent In the land
must make for a new and trenchant
spirit in literature, the literature of a
Ca'.ifornian school.
The future of California's literature
ran be largely molded by her two great
universit'fs. These two powerful leav
ening forces, exerting as they now do
an inf-uenre over the whole of the State
and beyond, have it within their power
to. foster and lend character to the
nascent school of Western letters. It is
? heir province to become for the Call
fornian circle what Harvard has been
for . the Kew- England salon of writers.
As scon as the universities begin to
make a distinct/effort to give technical
training in the higher realms of esthetic
thought with a view to perfecting talent
in the specialized branches of literary
creation, to soon will there be built tip
around them a circle of young writers
whose efforts will be a reflection of the
university training.
At the present time the University of
California and Stanford have only Just
commenced this policy of practical In
struction for writers. Stanford, which
has set the lead in thiÂ» movement, has
provided courses In both poesy and the
ehort story. In each instance the in
struction follows only after a thorough
grounding In poetics, the history of lit
erature and the analysis of standard
literary forms. In the hands of com
petent instructors these courses for
writers- are made as thorough, as the
ability of the students will permit, and
the results already have been Justified
by the work of some of the univer
sity's 'jrraduates. At the University of
California the adoption of this policy
has been of more recent time. Only
within the last year or so has there
been any attempt to foster talent In the
â¢hort story, and there are at present no
classes In verse writing. Beyond an ex
cellent training in the values and theo
ries of literature there has been very
little cf close study for practical crea
tion offered.

acy may come as a surprise to those

many victims hoyfjisruld- he remember
the woman-.and the' 'two boys whom he
had slain with" such levity so long ago!
When,' ( th)Erefiore," he received a chal
lenge-to-himself and to his quartermas
ter for \ carouse upon the last evening
of their; stay at the Calcos Bank he saw
no reas'oir to refuse. \ â¢ ...
A well. found passenger ship had been
rifled, the week before, so their fare was
of ..the .'best, and after supper five of
th'em drank deeply together. There
jvere the two captains. Birthmark
Sweetlocks. Ned Galloway and Israel
Martin, thec- old Â¦ buccaneersman. To
wait upon them was the dumb steward,
whose head Sharkey split with ' his
glass because he had been too slow in
the filling of It.' "> 'â¢â¢Â¦.. \ v
The quartermaster had slipped Shar
key's. pistols away from him. for It
was an old Joke with him to fire tk-em
cross-handed under the .'table and -see
who was the. luckiest man. It was a
pleasantry ~w,hlch ha<T cost his boat
swain his -leg. so now. when the table
was cleared, they would coax Sharkey's
weapons away from him, on the excuse
of the heat and lay 'them out of his
reach:
The captain's cabin ( of the "Ruffling
Harry '- was in a deckhouse upon the
poop, and -a stern-chaser gun was
mounted at the back of it. Round shot
were Â¦ racked round the wall and three
great hogsheads of powder , made a
stand for dishes and for bottles. In
this grim room the five â¢ pirates sang
"Then it must come out again. Free
man. My mind is made up, and the
Ruffling Harry must go slaving to
Whydah.*'
All argument and persuasion were
vain, so the manager had dolefully to
clear the ship once more.
And then Copley Banks began to
make preparations for his African voy-
Once there came a man who had been
â¢mate of a Gulneaman and who had es
caped from the pirate's hands. He
.cnuld not *r*ak for reasons which
Bhar!rey could best supply â but he
could write, and he did write, to the
*vÂ«ry great Interest of Copley Banks.
â¢For hosrs they sat together over the
"map. and the dumb man pointed here
and to outlying reefs and tor
tuous inlets, while his companion sat
smoking In silence, with his unvarying
face and his fiery eyes.
One morning, some two years after
his misfortune. Copley Banks strode
Into his own office with his old air of
energy and alertness. The manager
stared at him in surprise, for it was
months since he had shown any inter
eat In business.
'.'Good morning. Mr. Banks!" eald he.
"Good morning. Freeman. I see
the Ruffling Harry is in the bay." "
"Yes. sir; she clears for the Wind
ward Islands on Wednesday."
"I have other plans for her. Free
man. I have determined upon a slav
ing venture to Whydah.** Â¦'-.
"But her cargo is ready, sir."
Copley Banks said little when he
heard the news, but he sank into a
naorose and enduring melancholy. "He
neglected his business, avoided his
friends and spent"- much of his time
in the low taverns of the fishermen and
seamen. There, amid riot and devilry,
he sat silently puffing at his pipe, with
a f$e't face and a smoldering eye. . It
was ee.nerally supposed that his mis
fortunes had r" '-en his wits, and his
<?ld friends looked at hlna askance, for
the company he kept was enough to bar
him from honest men. 'â¢;Â»;
From time to time there came ru
tnors of Sharkey over the sea. Some-;'
times It was from some schooner which'
had seen a great flame upon the hor
izon and approaching to offer .help to
the turning ship had fled away at the
Â«lght of the sleek, black bark. lurk-.
Ing like a wolf near a mangled sheep.
Sometimes it was a frightened trader,
which had come tearing in with, her
canvas curved like a lady's bodice, be
cause che had - n a patched forÂ«Â«top
eait rising slowly above the violet wa
ter Jice. Sometimes it was from a
cocster. which had found a waterless
Bahama city littered with sun-dried
hodles.
There w*Â»re many men. both among
the islands and on the main, who had
a blood feud with Sharkey. but not
one who ha<1 suffered . more bitterly
than Copley Banks of Kingston. Banks
hsd been one of the leading sugar mer
chants of the Wesjt Indies.; He was
a man of jjosition. a member of the
Council, the husband of a Â¦ Percival
and thÂ« cousin of the Governor of Vir
gin-ia. -.His two sons had been sent to
London to be educated, and their moth
er had gone .over to bring them back.
On their return voyage the ship, the
Duchess of Cornwall, fell Into the hands
of'Sharkev. and the whole family met
with -an infamous death.
But there came a day when the fleets
ef thÂ« Buccaneers no longer mustered
at the Tortugas, and the solitary and
outlawed pirate took their place. Yet
â¢ven with him the tradition of restraint
and of discipline BtÂ«l lingered, and
among the early pirates-, -the Avorys.
the Englands and the Robertses, there
remalnwj come respect for human sen
timent. They., were more dangerous to
the merchant than to the pea man.
But they In turn were replaced by
more savage and desperate men, who
frankly recognized thatthjfty would get
no quarter In their inar with the human
race and who swore they would irive as
little as they got. . Of- their histories we
lenow little that is trustworthy. They
wrote no memoirs and left no trace
save an occasional blackened and
bloodstainei derelict adrift upon the
face of the Atlantic Their deeds could
oniy be surmised 'from the long roll of
enlps which ijever niade their report.
Searching the records of history it is
enly here and there in an old-world
trial that the veil that shrouds them
â¢ecrns for an instant to be lifted, and
we catch a glimpse of some amazing
land grotesque -brutality behind. Such
was the breed of Ned Low of Gow, the
Scotchman and of the infamous Shar
key, whose coal-black bark, the
Happy Delivery, was known from the
Newfoundland Banks to the mouths of
the Orinoco as the dark forerunner of
misery and' of death.
\ pHE Buccaneers were something
Â¦ ' I higher than a mere band of ma-
I rauders. They were a floating re-
I public, with laws, usages and dis
cipline of their own.,. In their
â¢ndless and remorseless quarrel with
the Spaniards they had some sem
blance of right upon their side. Their
bloody harryings of the cities. of the
lÂ£aln were not more barbarous than tho
inroads of Spain upon the Netherlands,
or upon the Caribs in these same* Amer
ican lands.

crew. The rest assembled aft and drew
up the articles of their association; ";a

skull palntedupon it and was hoisted

"Well,' Major Harvey," said he, "I
am '.vastly sorry to do anything which
may offend my friend, Copley Banks,
for many a lime have my knees been
under .his mahd'gany, but in face of
what you say there Is no choice for me
but to ' order you to -board the vessel
and to satisfy yourself as to her char
acter and destination."
"What do vou suspect?" asked the
Governor, who was a slow wltted man,
broken down with fevers and port wine.
"I susDect." said the soldier, "that it
is Stede Bonnet over again."
Now Stede Bonnet was a planter of
hieh reputation and religious charac
ter, who. from some sudden and over
powering frefhet wildness in his
blood, had given up everything In order
to start off pirating in the Caribbean
Sea. The example was a recent one.
and U h3d caused the utmost conster
nation in the Islands. Governors had
bef/i^e now b-an accused of being In
league with pirates and of receiving
commissions upon their plunder, so that
any : want of vigilance was open to a
sinister? construction.
These dolnjrs were 'not unnoticed, nor
yet uncommemed upcm irl the -towjr:Â«f
Kingston. The commandant of the
troops. Major Harvey of the artillery,
â made serious representations to" the
Governor.
'She is not a trader, but a small war
ship," said he. , "J.th'nk it would be as
we!l to arre:-t Cop!ey Bank^ a. d tu seizs
the vessel."
The crew was chosen from among
lbce<> whom Banks had met and known
in their own Infamous ha.unts. and his
own table steward was a haggard faced
man who gobbled at you when lie tried
to talk. His beard had been shaved,
and it was Impossible to recognize him
as the same man whom Sharkey had
placed under the knife, and who had
escaped to tell his experiences to Cop
ley Banks.
There was Birthmark Sweetlocks.
who was known to have been present
at the killing of the logwood cutters,
so that his hideous scarlet disfigure
ment was put down by the fanciful as
being a red afterglow from that great
crime. He was first mate, and under
him was Israel Martin, a little sun
wilted fellow who had served with
Howell navies at the taking of Cape
Coast Castle.
ar*. It appeared that he relied upon
force rather than barter for the filling
of his hold, for he carried none of those
showy trinkets which ravages love, but
the brig Was fitted with eight nlne
pounder guns. and racks full of mus
kets and cutlasses. The after sailroom
next the cabin was transformed into a
powder >magazlne. and .she. carried as
many round shot as a well found priva
teer. Water and provisions were ship
ped for^ a long voyage. -
But the preparation of his ship's com
pany was most surprising. . ,It made,,
Freerjsan. the manager. - realize ? T th'a't*/
there -was truth in the rumor that his"
master had taken leave of his senses.
For, under one pretext or another, he
began to dismiss the old and tried
hands who had served the firm for
years and In their place he embarked
tb> scum of the port â men whose repu
tations were so vile that the lowest
crimp would have been ashamed to fur
nish them.
and roared and drank. whl&the Â«UÂ«f
steward still filled up their glasses ana
passed the box and the candle round
for their tobacco pipes/ Hour after
hour the talk became fouler, the voices
hoarier, the curses and shoutings more
Incoherent, until three of the five had
closed their bloodshot eyes and dropped
their swimming heads upon the table.
Copley Banks and Sharkey were left
face to face, the one because he had
drunk the least, the Other because no
amount of llauor would ever shake his
Iron nerve or warm his sluggish blood.
Behind him stood the watchful ., stew
ard, forever filling up his waning glass.
From without came the low lapping of
the tide, and from over the water a
sailor's chanty from the bark.
Copley Banks glanced at the steward,
and the man took a. coll of rope trota
the shotrack" behind him.
"Captain Sharkey," said CoplÂ«T
Banks, "do you remember the Dttchea*
of Cornwall, hailing from London,
which you took and sank three years
(ago off the Statlra Shoal?"
. "Curse me ir I can bear their name*
.in mind," said Sharkey. rWÂ» did a*
many as ten ships a week about that
time."
"There were a mother and two sons
among the passengers. Maybe that will
bring it back to your mind."
'; Captain Sharkey leaned back In
thought, with his huge thin beak of ft
nose jutting upward. Then he burst
suddenly into a high treble, neighing
; laugh. He remembered It, he said, and
he aidded details to prove It.
'.- "BXifburn me If It had not slipped
from my mind!", he cried. "How cam*
you. to think of it?"
- "It was of interest to me," said Cop
ley Banks, "for the woman was my
wife and the lads were my only sons."
Sharkey stared across at his compan
ion: and saw that the smoldering flra
whic.h. lurked always in his eyes had
btifnejl up into a lurid flame. He read
â¢their and he clapped his hands
to his. empty belt. Then he turned to
seize a â¢weapon*; but the bight of a rope
was cast around him and in an Instant
his arms were bound to his side. HÂ«
fought like a wildcat and screamed for
help. * : >' (
>. "Ned!" he yelted. "Ned! "Wake up!

V- But. the three men were far too deep
ly surtk, in their swinish sleep for any
voice to wake- thefn. . Hvand and round
Â¦went the . rope; until Sharkey was
swathed like a.miinimy from ankle to
.neck. They propped him stiff and help
less against a nowder barrel, and they
.Bagged .him with a handkerchief, but
his/fllniyy.cedfdmmed/eyes still looked
curses at : them; Â«Thie f dumb man chat
tered in his\ exultation, and Sharkey
winced, for. the first, time when he saw
the empty mouth before him. He un

First of all they stove the heads of

they heaped the contents out upon the
table and floor. â¢ They piled It around
and under the thre'e, drunken men, un

or left; and $e dujnb man trussed him
up with' a sailor's cunning, go that
there -was 'no Â¦'chance that he should
work'-free. ' " rjÂ£~>.
- V'Ndw, yoju. blopay devil," Eald Cop
ley Banks, softly., "you must listen to
what -I hav.e> -t^,*say to you, for they
are the las.t. words that you will hear.
Â¦ YoiXi ar*>-,my' man now, and I have
bought you; at a price, for I have given
all that a/ man can give here below,
and I have, given my soul as well
"To reach "â¢ you I have had to sink

against it, hoping that some other way
might- corned but I learned that there
Â¦Was no other way. I've robbed and I
have murjjeredâ worse still. I have
laughed and lived with youâ and all
for, -.the one end. And now my time
has come, and you will die as I would
have you die. seeing the shadow creep
ing slowly upon you and the devil wait-
Ing for you in the shadow."
Sharkey could hear the hoarse voices
of his rovers singing their chanty over
the water. ,
The words came clear to his ear, and
Just outside he could hear two men
pacing backward and forward upon
the deck. And yet he was helpless,
staring down the mouth of the nine
pounder, unable to move an Inch or
to utter so much as a groan.'
To the dying pirate the Jovial words
and rollicking tune made his own fate
seem- the harsher. , but there was no
softening in his venomous blue eyes.
Copies Banks had brushed away thÂ»
priming of the gun and had sprinkled
fresh powder over the touchhole. Then
he had taken up the candle .and cut
it to the length of about an inch. This
he placed upon the loose powder at the
breach of the gun. Then he scattered
powder thickly over the floor beneath,
so that when the candle fell at the
recoil -it must explode the huge pilÂ«
In which the, three drunkards were
' wallowing. "
"You've made others look death in
the face, Sharkey." said he; "now it
ha*. come to be your own turn. Yyu
and these-swlne here shall go together!"
He lit the candle end as he spoke, and
blew out the other lights upon the table.
Then he passed out with the dumb maa
and locked the cabin door upon the
outer side. But before he closed it
he took an exultant look backward and
received one last curse from those un
conquerable eyes. In. the single dim
circle of light that Ivory-white face.
wHhithe gleam of moisture upon the
high, bald â¢ forehead, was the last that
.was. ever seen of Sharkey. (
There was a skiff alongside, and In It
Copley Banks and the dumb steward
made their way to the beach and looked
back upon the brig riding In the moon
light just outside the shadow of the
palm trees. They waited and waited,
watching that dim light wh!ch shonÂ«
through the stern, port. And then at
last there came the dull thud of a gun.
and an Instant later the shattering
crash of the explosion. The long, sleek,
black bark, the sweep of white sand
and the fringe of noddlnsr. feathery
palm trees sprang Into dazzling light
and back into darkness again. Voices
screamed and called upon the bay.
Then Copley Banks, his heart singing
within- him. touched his .companion
upon the shoulder. . and they plunged
together Into the lonely Jungle of tha
Calcoa. .

The Picture Laces for Hats.
And speaking 6f picture laces, these
are now the vogue. Laces wlth ; Rus
sian animals, trees and odd little stunt
ed shrubbery are made. And there are
picture laces, which actually show lit
tle Swiss houses and tiny "Alpine
scenes. These are for -;the "most part
made to order and are, the" property, of
the select few. who ,can have their, laces
designed for them. SSSm^^^t
The most striking .'picture ; laces
among the cheap laces are^the fruit and
flower laces. Grapes that stand out as
prominently as though they; were) the
real article can be purchased life size
for the trimming of the crown,' or, the
under brim of a hat. And small fruits
of all kinds are jflso purchasable \ in
lacy form to be cut out of one kind of
lace and applied to another.
That is the way with the picture
laces. No matter how brilliantly they
maybe executed, they. are cut out of
thftr natural positions, and taken away
from their own foundations to be ap
plied to lace of an entirely different
sort.
They are now weaving lace flowers in
detached pieces all ready to 'be applied
to the brims of hats and the fronts of
waists. And they are beginning to
make little lacy designs for the same
purpose, not on the flower order, but
in circles, squares Â« and ovals. These
can be found in very delicate patterns,
with mother-of-pearl scales, and they
also come with colored stitches -worked

none the less expensive, but â¢ more
<?heer*ul in aspect, though it can be

hats gloomy, for it is the style of the
winter to wear violets, roses and all
sorts of flow rs and.*" set them in the

. And there is another odd feature of
the .winter hats, namely, the combin

while ihis style continues there can
Be no complaint on the score of, the
darkness and dullness of the winter
hats. Gioom is positively driven
away by a sight of their floral gayety.
But, as the winter season changes
Into" early spring there Is a certain
delicacy, almost indefinable, yet none
the less there to be observed in. the
new hats.
, A hat which was worn by a plump
faced brunette beauty was intended
as a midwinter hat, a go-between, a
middle course twixt the pale floral
hats of midsummer and the heavy hats
of December.
ââ¢ It- was built, as so many hats are,
upon a foundation of wire. The brim
was covered with shirred chiffon, which
was put on over taffeta, all in creamy
white. X'nder one side of the brim
there were draped four large, creamy
ostrich feathers, which fell over the
hair -and ear right down upon the
Â«hould*er.
.The top of the hat, the crown, was
JcoVereo" with little white flowers, and at
short Intervals there were little sable
tails, which were twisted in through the
flowers. The tails in their dusky black
ness formed a sharp contrast to the lit
tle whUe flowers, while the creamy
Chiffon-, brim and the creamy ostrich
Seathers finished a picture which was
complete in every detail.
Thfe Recipe for a French Hat.
. A French milliner on being asked
how to make a haft replied: "Give roe a
Jjitge wire" frame and a handful of ma
terials and I will make you a hat."
With eft fingers she would shape
the wire frame until It was suited to
the fashion. She would lift it a very
little at one side and slope the brim
slightly, upward all the way around.
Perhaps she would take the back and
natten it and turn it down so that It
lay sharply upon the hair. Then, as a
finishing stroke to the shape, she would
give it a Gainsborough touch by set
ting a bandeau under one side so as to
produce the great sweeping curve. - -
Then would come her triumph of art,
the combining of the materials into
something a la mode. The brim needs
to be facfd inside, and for this the pret
tiest of materials are needed. A bit of
lace stretched flat over a taffeta foun
dation makes a very handsome hat fac
ing, and rome of the prettiest hats are

back or .any, other .part, for ; it would
be difficult to find a place upon a hat
which cannot be treated to a feather
or two. â¢ . â¢ â¢, . . '. ' ,.. 'â¢
If there are tips- enough a ? pretty
trimming, is made by arranging them
around the brim of a hat, or around the
crown Â¦ In a \ little . cjrele, with, the tips
"of 'the feathers .falling forward.;. This
can be done with the most charming re
sults: if the feathers be in blue, and
white.' A little circle of blue and whit*
feathers can be set around Â¦ a 'Â¦ crown
and if the feathers alternate a most
pleasing effect. is produced upon a hat
that is all black or a hat that la all
white. â¢ Â¦Â¦ / 'Â¦"'Â¦'AS'- Â¦> -Â¦ â¢
There is less of the up-curllnj ten
dency and a great daal more of thÂ»
flattening ;. treatment as far Â¦ ail isath
ers are concerned. Instead of draping
your* feather around the crown of your
hat, you are advised to lay It flat In
such a manner that the end of thÂ«
feather will curl over "> hair.
Will the Flat Hat Remain? ;
The question of the flat hat la on*
that is ever under discussion. ' Whether
It will be revived, or whether even that
which remain* of It's flatness will go
out of style. There are a few flat hats,
but none are now found of, the abso
lutely pancake variety. All -'are 'lifted
one side.. or in the front, which ,1s .by
far the most popular style of falL .
In fact. It is a summer that wfil gÂ»
hard with people jvho cannot wear-th*
hat lifted off the face, and there are
thousands that cannot. Many women
suffer almost a total loss of good looks
by the Uf ting. of the hi. t brim In the
front, while the hat that seta back
from the face and brings out the fea
tures in prominence is a hat whtch ab
solutely forces a woman to admit every
year of her age. . â¢ Â¦
Those who cannot adopt this style
have a great variety of shapes open
to them, for there are hats .now.: to fit
all types of beauty. < There are hats
.that tilt, at. one side, while the other
has a sweeping brim, and there are
hats with high square' . crown \ sur
? rounded by a brim which is almost
romantic in -its convolutions. Do not
despair, too matter how ugly you may
be in feature; for you can surely find
a hat that will just suit your type.
"And, when you find the right kind, it
may-- transform you from a plain
woman into a pretty one. Who knows?
"I have made. many a beauty.'*, Â«a id
a milliner, smiling o romoTacent smP*.

are to visit me to-day to be fitted with
Â¦picture hats. And I am- fairly nervous
over the prospect, for. they are ; ' Jons:

IshalKbe euuul to the task."

For some untold reason the word
"colonial" calls up visions of horsehair

pets, and they were . all right in their
place; but they were seldom if ever
found in the homes of people of means
excepting in their most modest apart

to be of the most elaborate quality, and
when one stops to think that the men
Â¦were in the habit of wearing satin

were so vastly different concerning

woven Btuffs the figures were small and
simple, and- as almost all of, the fur

Mr. Spencer left , the most stringent
and precise directions as to the funeral
ceremony. Some members of the com
pany at. the crematorium were
desirous i of proceeding; to High
gate Cemetery after! the coffin was
withdrawn Into the furnace. But they
were informed that: not even the inti
mate friends were aware of the hour
at which the cemetery would bÂ«
reached, and that Mr. Spencer had left
directions for only hla secretary to ac
company the urn to Its final resting
place.
This. Is to consist of granite and will
remain uniriscrlbed for several months.
Thereafter, will be engraved upon It an
inscription which- Mr. Spencer him

what were the illustrious thinker's
reasons for prescribing this long de
lay ,_but they are probably Â» be found
in a desire to avert the consequences
of the temporary emotional excite
ment created in his admirers by his
death. â London Dally Chronicle.
One great reason why the only child
is likely to b,e spoiled may b^ found In
the fact that the parents are disposed
to give the child nearly everything he
desires. Being the only child he Is
likely to get rriuch more than if there
were several children. His every wish
is granted by parents, grandparents,
uncles, aunts and friends. Such being
the case, is It any wonder that a child
reated in this way is apt to grow self
ish and expect the same treatment
from everybody, even when he grows
older and should know better?
The only child is apt to be petted and
complimented by all. If there were
more the praise would be divided. All
"Papa, I will do what you tell me."
Z'i had deliberately considered the
matter and made, a choice. He had
discovered that it did not pay to suf- )
fer the loss of a great deal of pleasure
for the sake of the satisfaction of
having his own way. Not a few times
thereafter it was neceesary to plac*

him in a chair and await his decisions.
In but few cases, however, did he de
cide other than wisely. Later hf was
trained into habits of obedience by
requiring him to comply- with such di
rections as. "Get un on this chair!"
"Come here!" "Go to that corner!"
"Sit on the floor!" and many other
similar commands. These directions
were given as If it were a game. Some
may object to such a method, but it
resulted In forming the habit of obe
dience in a child of unusually strong
will. In the past e Â«ght years that boy
has not once refused obedience to the
exprewed wish of the parent. May
this case not be suggestive to some
parent* who are naturally disposed
to show that they can not only be
more stubborn~than their child, but
that, by, relying on greater brute
fore*, they can compel them to do
as the parent orders? Such conduct
is not worthv of o loving parent.
i In the great proportion of cases of
stubbornness the child Is not Intention
ally so, though the contrary may seem
to be the case. It iÂ»eems almost impos
sible for some children to comply with
requests made under certain conditions.
They seem positively mulish, in the
ve^ry wors,t sense of "the word. Luckily
there are very few such. Many of these
are under an Intense nervous strain. It
reems that one of the best ways of
managing such a child Is to strive to
get the child to think of something else.
If he can be made to forget, it may be
easy to lead him back to the desired
path. Those who have had experience
with a balky horse will understand
what la meant. Buch have discovered
that no amount of beating will have
the slightest effect. One man, whose
horses were drawing a load of hay.
endeavored . to start one of the horses
by building a fire under the horse. The
horse moved far enough to get himself
out of danger and to set fire* to the
load of hay. By unhitching the horses
the man saved them. He has not yet
been able to collect the insurance on
the hay and the wagon. The parent
who uses brute force with a stubborn
child, of nervous temperament, may
fare far worse than this man. Those
who are most successful in the man
agement of such horses find their great
est success in diverting their attention
by tickling the nose, putting, dust In
their mouths, giving them something to
eat, or In some other way making them
forget their determination to be balk y.
May there. not be some suggestion in
this method of procedure for those par
pr.ts who have e-ceptlonally stubborn
children?
The . Only Child.
- How often the bnlv child grows up to
t*i- onjosltc of what parents, and
friends would wish. That: such is the
case all mujt admit, That there is
some good reason for this being the.
case many have surmised. What Â¦ the
reasons are few ha-** attempted to say.
H r^ OTV many parents have won
1 dered what they should do with
j[ 1 the child who positively re
Â±J fuses to da what he is
- - - told' Wh.at can be done
with such a child? The answer Is ncrt
â¢easy. What might answer for one
child mrjr be of very little use for an
other. Too parents think the
child Is depraved because he is stub
born.. Such Is not the case. Stubborn
ness is; firr.ply an indication of a Ftrong
will and should be treated as such.
In a later talk on the training 'f the
'will attention will be called to tne fact
that a strons will is a most excellent
thing for a child to possess. The trou
ble comes, of course, when the child
"won't" do right, but wills to do wrong.
Let the parent who has a child that
Is disposed to be stubborn not fnse
heart. Such a child ia a diamond In
the rough. Have you ever seen such
a diamond? There is nothing interest
ing In its appearance. None, save those
who can see below the surface, would
consider it of any value. Yet properly
handled it will show the brilliancy of
a gem of priceless value. So It will
be with the stubborn child, if only the
parent has wisdom and tact enough
to discover how such a one can be
reached. .
If the chllfl who is supposed to be
stubborn persists in stubbornness the
result may be very serious. It is apt
to affect. If not prevent, his future suc
cess in life. Once such a habit is firm
ly fixed it will not only show Itself in
the home, on every occasion, but it
Â¦will also assert Itself Jj the school and
In fociety. These are tbe ones who are
most likely to be misunderstood' and
unappreciated, both at home and . in
school. Too often they are those who
cannot be tolerated In company with
other children, lest other children pat
tern after them. The result Is that
they are expelled from school, educated
on the street and housed In the Jails
and penitentiaries of the land.
Managing; a Stubborn Child.
A child who had an exceptionally
strong will was trained Into an entire
ly different kind of a child by the fol
lowir- trea; t when still quite
young: When he refused to do as be
was told be was required to take a
particular seat and in the kindest tones
It was explained that certain conse
quences would certainly result If he
did not comply with the request made.
Care was taken not to make any
threats which vuld not and should
j.'it be carried' into execution. He was
told think the matter over and de
ride whether It r.-ould give him more
pleasure to do as he was told or to
reccU-e ct 'n punishments and lose
son-' priv*3pes which he would very
much enjoy. As wj expected, he de
cided to lose the privileges and take
the punishment rather than comply
vith the directions. Great care was
taken to see that e**ery detail of 'the
punishment was carried out in the
most kindly manner and yet with
eucL firmness as showed that he need
never count upon the Â£li*..tc~t modifl
cation of the penalitlea promisea.
The next time he refur^d to do as
tolu he was Â» laced on the same chair,
and somewhat Eirm.ar promises
made. Afier thinking; the ma'ter"

love a pet. and^ It Is well for an to have
one of some kind. If It be only a dot.
cat, a horse or some other animal. But
it la very Injurious for a single child
to receive all the petting which loving
parents are apt to bestow. No parent
should withhold commendation for
praiseworthy acts, but the undeserved
praise which the only child Is apt to
get la likely. to make him so proud and
overbearing that life Is miserable for
those who come in contact with him.
From the time the only child learns
to walk he is apt to be followed per
sistently. At every turn he Is Â¦ met by
a restraining hand. Much less oppor
tunity Is given for development than
to those children In families where the
number Is Buch that a great amount
of freedom Is necessarily permitted.
Such children may ' receive â¢ a few ex
tra bumps, but they will learn lessons
which will prove invaluable In after

' The Children of the Rich.
.'â¢\7hat has , been said -oncerr* Â»â the
* lining of the only child a^ ..lies with
equal. If not greater force to the chil
dren of the rich. Certain it is that the
children of the rich are, generally at a
great disadvantage in the battle of life.
It Is the exception when such. are able
to hold their own In competition with
those who come from families In which
luxury is unknown. The motto. "Give
the poor boy a chance," should be
changed. . It : should be made . to read.
"Give 'the child of the rich "parents a
chance." The poor boy will take a
chance and hold it "We need not bother
to give it to him. We are told on the
best of authority that it is easier for a
camel to go through the eye of a
needle than for. a rich mar. to; enter the
kingdom of heaven. The same figure
of speech might be used to emphasize
the difficulty of properly training the
only, child or, the child, of .wealthy par
ents. ' Too much - prosperity is apt to
ruin adults.; Is there any wonder that
a child Is almost certain to be ruined
by having his own .way all the 'time? '
-Who has not seen a child running the
house and all In It? Who has not felt
sorry for the unfortunate parent on thÂ«
street, In the car or In the home? Many
times one feels disposed to take chargi
of* such an. one for a short time. O&
such an occasion there would probably
be an attempt to cure "by the laying*
on of hands." l *
No one who baa watched a a polled
child bossing thing* could fall to feel
aorry for the parents. Many times they
are deserving of pity. In some casee
they do not seem to know they have
really nothing to say on most subjects.
In other casea they realize the condi
tion, but seem helpless.
But should not the child be pitied
even more than the parents? It Is not
his fault, but the result of Improper
training; upon his young shoulders rest
the cares of ths house. Ha must decide
whether, the parents shall go out or re
main at home, whether he shall go to
bed or stay up longer, whether he shall
eat what is put before him and ai to
a great many other questions, which
most parents decide for their children,
thereby, relieving them of a, great re
sponsibility. '
Who Is to Blame?
When such a condition exists, wlio*e
fault la It? At first we are^ disposed ta
blame the child. But la that Just? Un
der the same conditions would wÂ» not
have acted the same way? Long before
such a child could utter a word he was
probably trained to . do what he now
does. Before he was a month old. he
was probably taught that, even If com
fortable, he should not lie quiet, but
should cry, that he might be -walked,
rocked or patted until he fell asleep.
Ever since that time he has probably
had such training which most certainly
prepared him to be the despotic ruler of
the house.
But place the blame where you will,
the fact remains that no parent has a
right . to ruin a child by allowing him
to assume the duties which belong to
the parent. It is the parents* duty to
decide for the child until he has de
veloped sufficient Judgment to decide
for himself. It la the child's duty to
obey, and the parents' duty to see that
he does so.
AND THE ONLY CHILD
By William J. Shearer
THE STUBBORN CHILD
Eighteenth TalK to Parents
fancy and the writer predicts that
within the next ten years more than
76 per cent of the people will be wear-
Ing glasses. There are few people to
day who cannot relieve the eye strain
or benefit the eyes by the adjustment
of proper glasses. U is a positive fa.ct
that a very large class of eye troub'e
which was formerly considered incur
able, causing headache, pains in and
over the eyes, seeing black specks float
ing before* you. eyes watering and many
other errors of refraction and lack of
accommodation which years ago could
not be checked by any of the means
known to the profession, are now
promptly arrested and cured by the
proper adjustment of lense?.
The writer refers to one gentlemnn
who some eight months ago called after
the earnest persuasion of his frienda
and two of h's physicians, who su .;-
Rested that perhaps his ailment mlcht
be caused by his eyes being defective.
The first thing he Â«Â»aid was he dda't
believe that his eyes were the cau?Â»
of his trouble: that he could see as well
as anybody, but to satisfy his ph.'si
cians and friends he called upon me to
make an examination. I found the
gentleman In a very nervous and un
settled condition and after a thorough
test I prescribed compound lenses, for
an error known as hyperopic astigma
tism. This defect in severe cases causes
nevVous prostration, epilepsy and
sometimes insanity, which was the can
aid opinion of the gentleman, for he
said: Â¦ "Unless I can overcome my ner
vous condition it will drive me insane."
He formerly lived across the bay and
coming f:om and returning . home the
throngs of people affected jh'.s head and
tJtrves to such an extent that he could
not rest at nijht and during the day
vai almost incapable of properly at
tending to his business. 1 called on
the rentleman after having: worn the
glasses some six * months and found
him a comparatively new man, with
regard to his ability to work, and the
entire recovery of his nervous trouble.
There are, of course, many defects of
the eyes, and too often people buy
glasses that only partially overcome
their trouble, but they see ao much
better than formerly, that they feel con
tented and believe they have the
proper lens. iCo person can get a thor
ough test unless each eye is fitted sep
arately, and then, of course, by a com
petent- and conscientious optician, and
as I etated above, you should be able
to Judge the \ difference, between the
spectacle dealer or the so-called three
day diploma optician .from one who
has equipped himself and spared
neither time. nor expense In having a
thorough knowledge of his profession,
and this cannot be obtained in. from
two to .six months' time.
Presbyopia is a condition of the ad
vancing age. Technically this is not
an error or refraction by a loss or par
tial loss of the function of-accommoda
tion. The symptoms usually begin
about .the age of- 40, and near vision
becomes blurred and Indistinct. Print
runs together and you are compelled to
hold It too' far off. Tou hot only de
prive yourself the comforts, but it will
require more time for your eyes to re
cover.
Myopiaâ In this condition the eye la
too long, and Its refraction causes par
allel rays of light to focus before reach
ing the retina. The acuteness of vis
ion for distance -Is always below the
normal, while near-vision is usually
good. Myopia Is ; most frequently, if
not exclusively, acquired during school
life, and It Is often developed to quite
an extent before any inconvenience Is
experienced. This Is another reason
why all children goinjr to school should
be compelled to undergo an examina
tion of their eyes, at least at the begin
ning of each term. Too often children
are chastised because of the miscalling
Â¦ of letters or not being abte to see' the
print as the teacher or parent expects.
Hypermetropia ia commonly known as
far-sightedness. In this defect the ey*
is too short and Its refraction is not
sufficient to bring parallel rays of light
to focus on the retina. Hypermetropia
Is the direct antithesis of myopia, from
â¢which it differs nearly in every respect
It is the most common , optical defect
and often causes a great deal of trouble
unless corrected with proper glasses. .
Astigmatism Is an Irregular curva
turje of the cornea. This means that
one meridian of the eye refracts In ex
cess of the one at right angle to It
which causes imperfect vision for all
distances, the only remedy being cylin
drical compound glasses to bÂ« worn
constantly. We also frequently find
where one or both eyes require differ
ent ground le,ns because of the one eye
being stronger than the other and
which is seldom known until an experi
ment of some character is made. For
Instance you cover one of your eyes
with the* hand and attempt to snuff out
a candle suddenly placed within a few
feet of you. you will find that you will
invariably either overreach or under
reach and put the fingers too fax to
the right or left' of the flame. Or dip
ping the pen In the Inkstand on thÂ«
table Is an easy matter when one ha*
both eyes, but let him close one and h*
will find himself either overreaching oÂ»
to one side or the other, while with the
other eye. the one. that does practl
callyall the seeing, he has no difficulty.
The reason for the apparent reversal
of the habits noted above, the chango
from under or over reaching. Is nat
urally of the different focus of the eye
and demonstrates that the rood eye
has been doing practically all the work.
j x great deal more could be said that
would be of Interest to the reader. It
Is this fact,' however, that the writer
desires to Impress upon youâ never
treat carelessly or with Indifference an
organ whose mechanism Is of the most
delicate nature and Is considered al
most as valuable as life itself. It is
always safer and advisable to have the
eyes tested even in the simplest cases,
which In the end will prove more eco
nomical and give far .better results.
Â«O-f GREAT deal can be said about
f I the proper care and treatment
f 1 of the eyes. The writer is glad
- I to say, however, that the people
of this age are beco nlng en
lightened, and especially within the
past ten years. Years ago to see a
â¢ L.ld with a pair of glasses was to the
people of that day an awful thing, and
Invariably condemned. The opinion
prevail d that they were being worn
more for style than for service.
The wri*er never will forget the ex
pression of an old lady when she was
?oCJ that a little child acquaintance of
here, past 4 years of age., required
glasses. She threw up her arms and
paid, "That could not be 60. for wÂ«
didn't use to have to wear . glat-les,**
cÂ». d wendered what the people were
Â£O ning to. etc. V. â¢
I The fact is, all must concede the old
laying that the generations are 'grow.
Ing weaker and wiser, ar.d again be
cjyiseof the more eye strain, which is
the Â«?sult of the people reading more,
improper positions, greater clerical
work # and different machinery In facto
ri-3* and many other reasons that could
*Â»e mentioned that have a tendency not
only to strain the eyes, but make them
defective, and then it must be conceded
that .science of optics has been great
ly advanced, and to-day many errors
of refraction are overcome that years
a-go the b=>st optician knew-* nothing
ab?ut. You seldom find a man on the
ranch, for instance a cowboy who has
a clear field be Jore him. with defective
eyes. From eisht to ten hour?" work in
offl,ces and factories is one the prln
cipr results of eye trouble. Always
read and sew with the HeLt coming
over youi shoulder. Twelve to four
teen inches Is the proper distance.
Many times people under 40 years of
age have considerable of accommoda
tion and for a 6hort time ovejsome any
errors of refraction that might exist.
You often hear people say. "After I use
my eyes a rhort time they commence
to pain and I have a headache." JCoth
lng but specially groanc lenses will
overcome your trouble, and the opti
cian of to-day with strong competition
finds that he must thoroughly acquaint
himself with his work, and that It Is
necessary to have long practical ex
perience. He must be thoroughly com
petent if he hopes to succeed. Years
ago a man would attend a course of

GLASSES A NECESSITY NOT A FAD"WORTH WHILE"
How this phrase has been creeping
Into the speech and; thought of men
during the last few years. .If the
popularity of a word or a phrase" be
any true index of the moral Ideals' of
a nation, there Is : ground for encour
agement in the fact that Americans
are using this phrase more often than
formerly.. The /man who. uses It
thoughtfully and . wlth.any disposition
to guide his life by, what it signifies is
not far from the kingdom of God:
Back of this simple phrase is an ap
preciation" of the value and' the'ma
jesty of that- silent mighty, force
which we call time, as it sweeps stead
ily, Irresistibly : onward, connect
ing the' eternities.- Time, time, why,
that is, after all, one of the most
precious of human possessions. And
yet how men squander it., But.when'a
man begins to use the phrase," "worth
while,", instead, of throwing away .his
moments and his days, he begins to do
what the Roman) sage advised young
men, to do, namely, to "seize the day."
or, as the Apostle Â¦ Paul . put the mat
ter, to "redeem the time." .
Then, too, this phrase; Is rich with
thought' of the dignity and worth -'of
man.- It- intimates' that .'some things
are beneath him. It sets one to think-

1c T Is a curious fact that notwith
standing the great Importance &
', th^ subject In relation to our busi
ness affairs, the business men of
â¢njr country up to a very recent time
have ahown but little interest in the
Improvement of this service.
The legislation that has taken place
upon this subject has been most crude
and very fa? apart in its passage. Our
consular service was founded principal
ly under the acts of July 31, 1789, and
July 1, 1780. From that period d6wn
to 1855 there was practically no legisla
tion relating to this Important branch
of our servlco. The next legislation
affecting this subject was enacted In
1B81V which took away the excessive
fees which then existed In regard to
cm shipping. But It had the disad
vantage also that In taking away those
fe*s that were for the benefit of ship
ping it took away, to a large extent
the* compensation of our Consuls, and
.from that day to this" they have had
.very ilttle and unequal compensation.
I am *lad to say that the people are
beginning to take some Interest In this
subject. The boards of trade through
out our country and chamber* of com
merce and business men have taken up
this question and are now pressing it
upon the Congress for its reorgani
sation. , : 4
I wish to treat this subject entirely
in a non-partisan way. The consular
service relates to the business interests
of our country. It is essentially the
business branch of our Government.
Our Consuls are sent abroad to repre
sent the interests of our peopl^ to
protect their rights and to furnish citi
zens at home with reliable informa
tion., so that avenues of trade may be
opened up and necessary information
furnished to the merchants of our
country. The tenure of office should
be permanent, or for a long period of
time. What incentive have Consuls in
our service to-day for great and ade
quate work, when it is known that
their tenure of office is limited to fouÂ»
years, and that, even without a change
Member of Congress From Pennsylvania and Member of the Committee oh Foreign Relations of the House.
In the political party, the Consul prob
ably will be removed at the end of
four years? - -
Just at the very time when he has
probably learned the langauge of the
country;. Just at the time that he has
learned the trade requirements and
the avenues for opening business to
our people; Just at the very time, when
he has learned how to report Import
ant facts and valuable information,
he Is brought back to our country and
a .novice, unprepared in any way, is
Bent out to replace a competent man,
and he, too, is brought home when
he has reached a similar efficiency.
Now it is proposed to have examina
tions, and to have men pass such an
examination In order to enter this ser
vice. But we are met with this ob
jection: "We want business men. We
do not want classic students from uni
versities." Such examinations as are
proposed may not, it is true, prove
the entire fitness of the applicant for
the post of Consul, but they are surely
better than the requirements that the
Consul should be skilled in manipula
tion of primaries and conventions in
his own district
Permanent tenure is absolutely es
sential In order to secure energetic
work on the 'part of our representa
tives. How could you expect a man to
live in a tropical climate, where his
northern nature Is * enervated by a
warm atmosphere? How can you ex
pect a man that is enervated in this
way to work hard in prder to furnish
information when he kxlows that his
endeavor will receive no response and
no acknowledgment in the way of pro
motion, and that he simply will be re
turned home at the end of his four
years?
GJve that man a hope that he will be
promoted; give that man an incentive
to work â that he will be moved both to
a better climate and an increased, pay â
and you will give him, an incentive to
furnish our people with that Informa
tion which is so essential to our devel
opment.

showing that men were ready to enter
the* serviceâ that they would gladly
avail themselves of the advantages
thus held out of permanent tenure, In
suring them of life service, if they de
sired it. in this peaceful pursuit, tend
ing to build up the foreign commerce
of their country. If such has been
found to be the fact in Great Britain,
a similar condition will be found to ex
ist in our country. The young men of
our country . are alive to the advan
tages such positions may offer them.
Give them the opportunity, supported
by the assurance that it means a live
lihood for life, and you will have our
consular service filled with the best
ability and energy that the young men
of our country can furnish.
Those who have been most familiar
with the necesities of the case have
-'or a long time been urging action by
Congress upon this subject. All our
Secretaries -- State, all our assistant
Secretaries of State who have had this
matter under their immediate super
vision have been pressing this meas
ure of reform upon Congress.
Nearly, 't//ery man who has been
prominent in the consular service,
though he may have felt that hl3
mouth should be closed while he was
exercising active official duties under
the Government, has, on retiring from
office, testified to the necesity for thtÂ»
change, and has shown wherein the
necessity lay.
Let a system be inaugurated by
which' men may pass examinitions;
let salaries be equalized, tenure of
office protected, and the men who do
good work be retained and promoted,
and the consular service of the United
States will be vastly improved and be
equal to the necessities of the phenom
enal growth of our commerce and the
extension of the Influence of our coun
try.
shlerable period?
"To improve the service, salaries
should be readjusted and equalized.
There is no set of men ocqupied in the
same class of work that are paid so
unequally as our Consuls. It is essen
tial that men doing the same service
With equal energy should be paid an
equal compensation.
The necessity of trained men is
everywhere apparent. Before the
breaking ' but of the Spanish War it
was necessary that our Government
should have the most reliable informa
tion of what was taking place In the
kingdom of Spain. How can a Consul
who does not understand the language
of the country to which he is^ sentâ
who' cannot read the papers â in what
position is he to ' furnish- his home
Government with necessary ' informa
tion? What does he know of the temper
of the press, If he cannot read the edi
torials? What does he know of the do
ings of the people, if he cannot speak
, their language and mingle among
'them? How can any man who is thus
tied of tongue, living among a people
whose language he does not know,
gather information such as his home
.Government may require?
This need is more pressing now than
at any : < previous time In our hlstofy.
With . the great i development that is
taking place in our manufacturing or
ganizations, the proposed development
of. our merchant marine, the extension
of our colonies into all quarters of the
world, , It becomes more than ever es
sential that we should have a trained
corps of Consuls.
It may be asked where will such a
body of trained men* be found? Only
last winter, when this subject was
pending before the ' House, I received
letters from two I universities asking
with regard to the' probabilities of the
passage of a bill such as I am advo
cating, and declaring their willingness
to Â¦ Introduce a special course . to pre
pare men, for these positions.

Cereal products are usually grouii...
sacked, held In warehouses for months
and then In the pantry for other
months. Being dry. they absorb mois

surrounding atmosphere. A sudden
change of climate or a warm spell sup
plies all that Is necessary for the pro
pagation of germs and animal life of
any kind. Living on the cereal, the
nourishing part is consumed, leaving
for man the refuse only.
Of course, this devitalized food
taken into the system overworks it,
without results to its benefit. I havw
therefore sterilized a cereal, subjecting
it to a uniform heat and sealing it at

The product, being thoroughly dry,
takes on twice the bulk usually ob

utilized by the digestive apparatus and
only hamper the system.

leaving the other properties intact.
Sterilized, packed, sealed, then resoaked

albumen, leaving only the fiber and

" In my experiments I have striven to
preserve the full food values and hava
at last made a success of it.
I have endeavored to place in tubes
the variety of foods craved by the sys
tem. One will contain cereal, beef and
cocoa. Another fish, rice, coffee. An
other chicken, peas and tea, etc. Spe
cial dish tubes of fish alone or turkey
or beef, mutton or pork, with a tube of
bread, make a' meal for two persons.
Condensed foods, generally speaking,
are stimulants. Condensation removes
bulk. The human stomach, being a
large vessel.frequires bulk in order to
satisfy it. A nut. for Instance, will
sustain a squirrel, for the stomach is
tiny. But in a human being quantity
as well as nutrition is essential.
As an example of the stimulating
effect of concentrated food, give a dogr
a pall of water; give another, one with
a strong extract of meat. The dog
which has drunk the water will lie
down, while the other dog will rush
excitedly around and finally drop from
sheer exhaustion. . >
The food that really benefits the sys
tem is tissue builder; the food that
passes in and out of the system, mere
ly a stimulant. Cereals are the most
Important of tissue building foods.
Beans contain some of the elements of
all foods. .
I therefore began my research with
cereals. I found that to preserve them
in their, natural state they should bo
sterilized and hermetically sealed. It
seems simple enough, does It not? Yet
simplicity is the sour of art, not alone
in the realms of higher art, but in the
humbler fields of domestic utility.
Hitherto sterilizing a cereal involved
cooking. This, however, does not leave
It in its natural state. A cereal Is
composed of starch cells. Cooking
bursts these cells. Popcorn, as an ex
ample. In the popped- corn several
times the original bulk results. ' Thick
ening of flours;' starch, -rice, etc., with
water, ditto. How, then, to retain the
original compact form and still sterilize
wa"s the problem confronting me â to
prevent, in other, words, the burst
ing of the starch cells and at the same
trtne submit the cereal to a heat suffi
cient to exterminate the germ. Ob
viously the first desideratum Is to get
the product fresh, for from the mo
ment of its fruition, although intended
for man. It is the prey of other living
things. Microscopic germs, weevils,

beauty of Southern California that set
in motion there the great land boom,
which began in 1SS3, which has con
tinued in some places, such as Los
Angeles, ever since, and which in
other localities subsided, because it
outgrew itself. The immigrants to that
section of our country were health
and home seekers, rather than for
tune seekers. They were generally
people of means. They covered the
country with stately palaces and ar
tistic cottages. They engendered a
fever of speculation which made real
estate as marketable as wheat or rail
road stocks, and the increase of values
Â¦was rapid and enormous. Instances
were not wanting of ranchers selling
their farms arid orchards at hundreds
of dollars per acre, and within a year's
time investing the money in the pur

out of the same property, at the same
price per lot at which they had sold

were constructed in every direction.

Things bad been running smoothly
at the Etore for months and months,
when there came such an interruption
as had never been known before. A
woman lost a purse containing fifty
dollars. There was not a half a dozen
people in the store at the time, and she
was sure the had It In her band when
Â¦he sat di/wn at the counter presided
over by Miss Trent. Search was made
at once and continued for half an hour.
Jones had left the store five minutes
before the alarm was raised to cet an
early dinner and attend a funeral, and
he did not learn of the loss until sev
eral hours after. Then he proceeded to
a judicial examination. He called In
the constable and the justice of the
One of the three male clerks in the
store was named James Thomas, and
It was generally understood in the
village that he was "sweet" on Minnie.
Borne said that It was through his in
fluence that she secured her place, but
that was not the truth. One of the other
clerks was a bachelor of forty-five.
Nobody could ever understand how
he turned to mercantile life. He seemed
to be as slow-witted as he was slow
footed, and his personal appearance
Â¦was anything but prepossessing. It
was doubtful if any other merchant
except Jones would have employed him
at any wages.' but Jones wanted honest
people about him. and he had the high
est confidence in Albert Ross.
(Copyright, 1904. by K. M. Whitehead.)
THE signs on the village stores
read: "Jones & Co.. Dry Goods.
Groceries, Hardware, etc," but
there was no "Co." It was put
on by Jones because he thought
it would look well and somehow in
crease his importance. Salathiel
Jones was Jones & Co., and the only
Jones, and he was a mystery to all
who knew him. He was a successful
merchant, and at the same time he
was so absent-minded that he was
daily laughed at by scores of people.
His 'store was by all odds the largest
establishment of (Its kind for miles
around, and for many years he had
had four male^clerks in his employ.
Then one day, to keep up with the
times, he gave a place to a young
woman, and Miss Minnie Trent made
her debut behind the counter at
which most of the women customers
made their purchases.
In taking in Miss Minnie, Jones had
â¢ided a worthy widow and a smart
and good-looking daughter to eke out
their income, and he deserved all
credit for it- True, he called her
Minnie or Miss Trent hajf of the time,
and there were occasions when he
looked at her and wondered where hÂ«
could possibly have seen her before,
but he was a good employer and she
a smart salesgirl, and things went
along without any trouble.
peace, and the employes were examined
and cross-examined.
The loser was firm in raying that no
other person except Miss Minnie was at
the counter when she missed her purse,
and although she made no charge there
could be but one inference. She herself
was permitted to search the protesting
and Indignant girl, and a thorough
search was made above and under the
counters and all over the store, but
nothing was brought to light. Then
Jones did the right thing. He handed
the woman $50 with his compliments
and regrets and said nothing further
to the clerks. Nothing further would
have been said by any one had not the
woman talked.
Anything is a sensation in a village.
The fact that $50 had been lost in Jones
if. Co.'s was a big sensation â bigger
than a circus 1 and a Fourth of July in
one. People at once divided off. One
half of them were sure that' the daugh
ter of the widow had yielded to the
sudden temptation and concealed the
purse for her future benefit; the other
half charitably argued that some one
else had picked it up. or even that there
had been no loss at all. Jones & Co.
tried to pass the affair over and hush
it" up, but the people wouldn't ha/e it
that way. It was a good thing to hang
onto until some woman eloped or some
man. stole sheep, and it became a lead
ing and a burning question. It resulted
in quarrels between neighbors/and
those quarrels finally resulted in Miss
Trent being called a thief and having
to take legal cognizance of it by bring
ing a suit for slander. The defendant in
that suit swore out a warrant" for the
girl on a charge of having appropriated
the $50, and there was as pretty a- ket
tle of fish as a town ever saw. 'Â¦/Â¦Â¦.
Jones & Co. and the three clerks were
placed in an unfortunate position.
While all of them fully believed in the
girl's ' Innocence their" testimony on a
suit would hardly favor her. *f the
purse was lost at her counter, as ll.e
loser was ready to swear, then It must
be admitted that only the two were
there at the time.
Things certainly looked very bad for
Miss Trent, and the mental worry had
put her under .the. doctor's care,, when
a strange thing happened. Albert Ross,
f e old bachelor clerk, went before a
Justice of the Peace and chargei him
self with the offense and made a full
confession. % In this confession he ad
mitted to passing the counter while
clerk and customer were -busy looking
at goods, and to have seen the purse
and slipped It into his pocket. He had
destroyed the purse, but he r 'Â¦ ready
to restore the money. He asked to be
arrested, tried and punished, and In
the course of a week he was arraigned
and bound over. to a higher court for
trial. . .â¢ i
If there had been excitement before
"Then you thought him guilty/and
sacrificed yourself for the both
US?" '. ; Â¦ V Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦{;,.
"Wellâ erâ well,' you see, I'm get
ting old and homelyâ and I never, ex
pect "to mkrryâ andâ Â«i>-well,' it's s all
over with." 1 x ,.,',
- And so it was; except that the girl
threw her arms around his neck and
kissed him and her tears dampened his
wrinkled cheeksâ the first" tears 'and
the first kiss since he was a baby
in his mother's arms.
The trial in the higher court came
along in about a month, and Ross
pleaded guilty and .was sent to State
prison for a year. He took the sen
tence meekly, and in a couple of days
had disappeared from sight of the peo
ple who Â¦ had known ' him for fifteen*
long years and believed in his honesty
"every. day. Miss Trent returned. to
the store, and things went on in the
old way except .with Jones &" Co.
Jones did not for one instant believe
the girl guilty: neither did he believe
that Ross topk the purse. . He went
about scratching, his -head and talking
to himself and.vlrying to remember
something, and>itÂ£was one day, after
one of his "fitÂ§fc*Â»had lasted him for
half an hour, and he suddenly jumped
up and down and usÂ«d a swear- word.
Next instant he clapped on his hat
and started on a run for home, he Â¦> be
ing a widower with a housekeeper. In
fifteen minutes he was back at the
store with the purse In his hand.
It was as easy as breaking (eggs.
Jones had passed - the counter while
the two women were looking at some
garment. He had seen the purse arid
picked It up to hand it along to Its
owner. A clerk had called him at the
moment and he had started off. ..The
purse had gone Into his coat-tail
pocket, walked home to" dinner with
him,; and when he changed his coat to
go to the funeral it was Â¦ left in the
old one. Upon his return he I had put
on ' another, and so for. weeks' % the
missing money had been hanging In
his wardrobe. '. Â¦â¢. V..
"Why. did you do it?" asked Miss
Trent of the homely and Ill-shaped old
bachelor : as he returned from prison
with his character fully cleared. v '-*Â¦
"Iâ I thought I was 'rullty," he
lamely replied. . 'Â¦ ,
"No! you thought, I was iruilty!".
"Nbt that. Miss Trent. Iâ I knew
that James loved i you, and that youâ
you loved him, and -thatâ thatâ -â">â¢Â£(
there was sensation now. While Miss
Trent's character was cleared, people
hesitated to believe that ' Albert Ross
was a thief. However, when' a man
says he is a thief, swears that he Is a
thief, and demands that he be sent tf
prison as a thief, what are you goinr
to do about it? The key to # unlock th r
mystery was kicking aro'und under
foot, all the time, but nobody could
see it.

London architects who devote
themselves to preparing plans and de
signs for millionaire mansions are not
waiting to receive instructions from
the Duke of Roxburghe as to hi3 ac
tual wants In the way of a London
town house. Ever since the announce
ment of the engagement of the Duke
to Miss Goelet a number of them have
been working at express speed getting
out what they hope to be their finest
architectural creations. "Never has
there been such competition," said a
distinguished architect to the writer,
"to secure the acceptance of a de
sign." In the ordinary course it would
cost at least $5000 to prepare plans
such as some of those .that will bo

estimated that at least fifty are al

though It is not so very long since Sir
Robert appeared in the same court to
make arrangements for settling pre

moreover, when sho may have worked
eighteen hours out of the twenty-four,
as is quite her custom.
A London theatrical man said of
Mrs. Campbell a few days since: "She
will yet be as great an actress as
Bernhardt. She is far on the path
now and scarcely 'past 30. She has
almost Puritanical ideals of morality,
and she works as I have never seen
a woman work in my life." >. /
Mrs. Campbell's home life and so
cial life have none of the rouge-and
powder aspect attributed to the off
stage hours of acresses by those who
know little about the subject. She
lives in a typically grim and outward
ly ugly house in the quiet and rather
fashionable Kensington Square. But,
as is so often the case with a forbid
ding smoke-stained London house,,
once you get inside you find yourself
surrounded with every evidence of
rare taste in art and books. Mrs.
Campbell's favorite and most cher

to obtain a hitherto unpublished
photograph by a famous amateur,
which shows the actress at home,

from the photograph.

Mrs. Campbell was born to romance,
as it were. Her father, John Tanner,
was living in Bombay, when he fell in
love with a beautiful Italian circus
rider, Louisa Romanini, whose father
was the- proprietor 'of the show, and
married her, to the great astonish

mother, a charming Italian who
speaks English brokenly,* almost in
variably accompanies her daughter to
kow-towing to those higher up, and
condescending to those lower down
the social scale, as the climbers have
to do. it doesn't appear to make a

artistic and Intellectual life rather
than her dramatic interest which de

MRS. MARTIN'S CHARITY.
Only those who are Immediately
concerned hardly ever hear of the
charity which Mrs. Bradley Martin
and her daughter, Lady Craven, dis

hospitals, particularly those devoted to
women and children, are the chief
objects of their attention. Twice a

These children are a curious mixture
of their. Irish father's temperament
and the Italian artistic traits of their
mother. It is not generally known
that Mrs. Campbell and the late Pat

respectively. They were passionately
in love, and other reports to the con

until Mr. Campbell's death.
According to all accounts, Patrick
Campbell was a good fellow, of good

Pinero happened to be present. With
his genius for discerning genius he in

woman should be cast in the title role
of "Mrs. Tanqueray," which was then
almost ready for rehearsal. The wise

Ma'riborough's Wife Is

Men.
LONDON. Jan. 20.â When the
Duchess of Marlborough can spare a
moment from the many social and
public functions that make such a
huge demand upon her time she turns
for recreation to invention. She has
'â¢"en devoting herself energetically to
her favorite pastime lately with fa
vorable results. A packing case for
ladle?' trunks supposed to defy the
ingenuity of railway thieves is one of
her latest production?. She has also
invented a collapsible cycle sunshade
which becomes a supr^rt fox* the ma
chine when not otherwise in use. Her
new mansion in Mayfair will see many
domestic contrivances which are the
result of her inventive genius. One

converted into a servant's writing desk
by mtrelj: touching a spring. She is
also working on a new idea for win
dows 'which architects and medical
men say will solve a difficult problem
in connection with the open-air treat
ment of consumption.
Her. Grace's method of Â¦working is
easy. ' She usually carries a sketch
b<~ok about with her and makes rough
drawings and -jots down ideas as they
occur to Her. When these are elabo
rated they are sent to a model maker
with whom slie has a special contract,
Â«ind in whose name the patents are
registered. It is understood that she
has never yet turned her labors as an
inventor into cash, but she has been
Kgt successful lately in producing use
ful articles that I am told she may
soon place some of them on the.mar

of her life, and she is daily Inundated

' The. difference between English taste
contrasted with American liking for
theatrical entertainment is again
shown In J. M. Barrie's newest satire,
"Little Mary," which Charles Frohman
recently brought out in New York. This
piece enjoyed a. run of wonderful pro
portions In London, where Barrle, de
spite his evident bitterness toward
English society, is a prime favorite. It
is an open secret that Manager Froh
man counted upon this play as one of
his biggest American successes-to-be
this season. "Little Mary" has been
seen in New York, and, strangely
enough, they have not taken to it at ail
on this side.
Weber & Fields close' their New
York season yesterday, and to-morrow
will start direct for this city with their
entire company, numbering nearly a
hundred. They will open at the Grand
Opera-house on February 8 for two
weeks, and then will play back East.
The reason for curtailing their New
York season and making this long jour
ney is because they believe there is a
larger profit awaiting them out of
town, and that It is better to realize it
than to prolong a stay in New York
that is less profitable than usual, owing
to prevailing conditions. Weber &
Fields are under a heavy expense, and
while their receipts at the Music Hall
have been large they have been less
than in previous seasons. Their ex
penses are said to be in the neighbor
hood of $7000 a week.
Sam Thall, who was at the California
Theater with "The Chaperones," says
that while here the chorus girls of his

do all he could to make the sisterhood

benefit to all the ambitious spear car
riers and "hurrah girls." Mr. Gompers
when they appealed to him may have
been joking, but the girls have taken
his proffered aid seriously and are

I Miss Claude informed me that she
I has been* on the slago five years, and
1 that $.he is not, as might be inferred
from her glib mouthing of the Cock;

life "when quite young." As she
i talked to me she looked to be in the
; parly twenties.
"My principal ambition." she said.
1 "is to so back to London and show

They would not take my word for it

they would not depart so widely from

' tiny youngster as myself â to begin

cessity did not compel me to start as
' a chorus girl, 1 decided to make my

; forever, ?nd finally patience was re
! -warded by my getting a 'bit' in a
London production. I played an
American girl and a German boy in
The Cadet Girl,' an Irish maid in
â¢ 'The Prima Donna.' and a chappie in
f "The Supper Club," before I finally
' made up my mind to emigrate to a
T country where one is not obliged to
1 be as old as a grandmother to obtain
I managerial attention. One of the first
â¢ persons to greet me on thÂ« wharf at
Â¦ Xcnv York was Marcus Mayer, who
'Â¦ had seen me work in London. On tlia
> . spot he engaged me to play Ki-FI in
â¢ 'The Bella of Xew York.' It was my
first important rolp and. I made more
than good in H the first night, al
though I was a stranger in the land
and â "
"Unfeatured in advance â "
"I was going to say and unknown
to fame,' but thankfully accept the

i prompted it."
Â¦ , "And since then?"
â¢Since then I have been able to
choose my engagements. But, as I
. have told you, the managers seem to
tvnnt me only for the sort of work I
â¢ least like. Mr. Shubert has booked
â¢ me to star for him next season, but
he won't reveal the character I am to

. ever, that it is either a boy or a hoy

, be resigned to my fate."
Something malicious silently urged
\ me to comfort her by remarking that
j as a star she would be featured in ad
vance, but again her paucity of inches
and avoirdupois deterred me. So in
stead I asked her if 'Toby' was her
baptismal name.
"Every onÂ« asks me that." she re
plied, "and the query is becoming so
tiresome that a dozen times a day I

Toby, but my father dubbed me Toby
when 1 was a toddler â because I was
bo diminutive, I Â«uppose â and the pet
name has clunjj to me ever since. Folk
say it's 'cute.' but I think it's ca
nine. Mr. Punch's dog is Toby, you
know."
"It's a distinctive cognomen, any
v.ny, and tha.t is something worth
having in your profession. Then.
again, it seems so applicable to your
art"
"My size, you mean, but you don't
like to say it." /
"No, I sincerely mean your art.
'Toby' is *o soubrettish â "
"That it wouldn't flt any other
branch of the business. Just think of
a tragedienne or an emotional star be
ing billed as Toby so-and-so. Wouldn't
that be the limit of Incongruity?"
"Your real name, then â "
"Must remain a mystery to your
- readers. A little mystery isn't a bad
thing to surround oneself with In this
profession, and my concealment of my
name is the only means by which I
can excite public curiosity. It was
his romantic air of mystery as much
as his singing that made Jean de
Keszkc so charming to my sex, and as
my voice is much the#same as hi3 â
you heard it last night and must con
cede that â I am entitled to wear as
much mystery as I can pile on, and
that wouldn't be nearly as much as is
necessary to envelop the stalwart form
of Mr. do Reszke. But how did you
like my singing in 'A Chinese Honey

Candor and gallantry went at it like
bulldogs and the conflict throttled
speech.
"Don't hurry your reply," said Miss
Claude, with deadly calmness, "and
when you ore ready to say something
-don't let it be to the effect that my
voculism charmed, because I wouldn't
believe you. Nobody can me
about my singing."
Blessed relief! I breathed It forth
in opinion that some of the songs were
rather good.
"Name them," said Miss Claude.
"Well, that medley of -nursery
rhymes, for instance.".
"It's a silly thing" â conventional
British humor â but its absurdity
seems to touch a responsive spot in
the fancy of American audiences," was
Miss Claude's criticism. "I like it be-

"Indifference, petty racial jealousies,
intrigues, disappointment . and even
failure," she says, "are but a few of
the hardships against which American
girls must contend when they go
abroad. No other singers have such a
hard time, for the American is obliged
to learn so many different languages in
order to sing in the different countries.
For example, in Germany a singer will
be allowed for one year to sing in Ital
ian an opera composed by an Italian,
but by the end of that time she must
have learned the German language or
she will no longer be recocnlzed.
"France sometimes permits German
or Italian opera to be sung, but to at
tain any degree of success, to gain' their
stamp of approval, the American girl
must not only sing in French, but with
out a foreign accent. So prejudiced are
the French in favor of their own lan
guage that they would rather hear the
wretched accent of one of their peas
ants than the accent of the foreigner,
even though she be crowned with artis
tic merit and superior ability.
"Then, again, Italy Is most conserva
tive. All music and interpretation are
confined to the Italian artist, and they
refuse tc attend a performance of a
French opera in French, or a German
opera in German, and as for an Eng
lish opera, no matter what the merits
of the artists might be, it would simply
not be tolerated. \ The Italians care
very little for the accent; what they
ask for is the language. No matter
what the opera be written in, it must
be sung in Italian or it will be vetoed
and excluded. .
"For an American singer to attain
any degree of success abroad she must
know at least four languages besides
her own. The greatest German artists
sing only In two. The Americans are
far more tolerant. Here we recognize no
nationality -in genius, but are ever
ready to applaud and appreciate merit.
Every year Americans extend a wel
come hand to artists and musicians
from every land. At the Metropolitan
Opera-house in New York I have heard
'Faust' sung in both French and Italian
at the same time. But should an Amer
ican girl abroad propose to sing her
part In English the whole opera-house
would rise in consternation. I do be
lieve in artists singing in their own
language, for if they do not exploit
their mother tongue, who will?"
Mme. Blauvelt, the.American opera,
oratorio and concert singer, who re
cently returned from an extended con
cert tour in England and on the Con
tinent, has given expression td some
very interesting comments on the ex
periences of American singers abroad.
There 13 no other American singer,
perhaps, so well qualified to speak en
this subject as she, for she gained the
greater part of her musical education
abroad and has had wide experience
in Europe in concert and in opera. She
was decorated by Queen Victoria of
England and Margherita of Italy, and
wears the medal of the Society of St.
Cecilia of Rome, the oldest singing or
ganization in the wor!d. She is the
only Â¦ woman who ever received this
medal, and she and Paderewski are
the only living musicians who possess
it. Her experience and indorsements
as an artiste abroad, where she Is the
most popular American singer, give. her
observations great weight and author
ity.

Here is one announced- for this week
by a Baltimore stock company that
sounds good and strong. The company
is to present for the week a double
bill consisting of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde" and "Camille." .
"Sweet â¢Kitty Belairs," David Be
lasco^ latest production, .in which
Henrietta Crosman ia the star, is final
ly a great play. Thic? statement i3
due to the fact that, another person
has stepped forward to claim that the
piece is taken from an original manu
script submitted to Belasco some sea
Â«sons ago. It is never considered that
a Bolasco play is a genuine success
until some one bobs to the surface Â«*rÂ»d
charges the producer with having
borrowed their idea?. The latest
claimant for such distinction is Marie
Montagu, who claims that a Ions
time ago she wrote a piece called
"Sweet Jasmine." She thinks the man
uscript must have fallen into Belaa
co's hands, for the Crosman vehicle,
according to her allegations, follows
the plot and Incidents of that story
rather closely. Belasco say3 he never
heard of Miss Montagu, and that his
latest effort is a dramatization of
Egerton Castles novel, "The Bath
Comedy."
"Joseph Entangled," a new comedy
by Henry Arthur Jones, has been*suc
cessfully launched in London. The
comedy is said to be bright and enter
taining in its way, but deals with the
rather unwholesome subject of a sin
gle sister endeavoring to shield her
married si3ter from being discovered
by her husband for her part in an in
trigue. The theme is rather sugges
tive of Clyde Fitch's "Frisky Mrs.
Johnson." The piece was fairly well
received by the London critics, and
the chances are that it will last out
.the present season in London.
Captain Robert Marshall, the au
thor of '"A Royal Family" and "His
Excellency, the Governor," has
brought out another br".Iiant success
in London. His latest effort is called
"The Duke of Killiecrankie." It was
produced at the Criterion Theater In
London and won a brilliant success,
according to the cable news from the
other side. The play kept the house
in roars of laughter, according to th<Â»
same authority. Its interest hinges
upon the abduction of the willful he
roine by the Duke, who carries her off
to his Scotch castle, the escapade win
ning her love.
Win McConnell is "forninst" the show
girls and in favor of good, old-fash
ioned .tights. Commenting on the new
demands coming to the surface in East
ern theatrical circles he says:
"This Is the last season the show girl
will be exploited to any considerable
extent. She has been a very costly ex
periment for the managers, and they
have storehouses. full of Parisian gowns
that are not worth a cent on the dollar.
'Florodora' started the craze for show
women and imported gowns. . It mad*
a hit, and the public seemed to want
it." Then every manager insisted on
dressing all his women in long trains.
This would be all right if they couid
only get the girls to wear them, but
your Maxie Mudd cannot throw down
the washboard, don fine dresses and
act up tb them. It won't do. All show
girls look alike.
"What the managers want to do ia
to get back to tights or knee or ankle
dresses. Just as soon as you piÂ»t a
chorus girl in a low-necxed dres3 she
must, live up or down to the dress and
becomes dignified and humorous to ihe
public- She apes the manners of tha
Astorbilts and is a huge joke. Go back
to the Lydla Thompson days and gtvs
us tights and have the chorus girla
play themselves."
Dr. Richard Strauss, the eminent
German conductor and composer, who
comes to America this spring, is said to
be looking forward with as much pleas
ure to the trip as are his many ad
mirers on this side. The fact is Dr.
Strauss is very much Americanized in
many ways already, and for a down
right strenuous existence is a mate for
President Roosevelt. He has been
known, for example, to rehearse and
conduct an important concert in ona
day and to take the train immediately
after and travel all night, only to reach
his destination in time for a brief rest
before plunging again into a long and
arduous rehearsal, followed by a bril
liant concert, at which audience and
orchestra alike have been stimulated to
the highest pitch of enthusiasm; then
supper and talk with friends until al
most morning, when he was once morÂ»
ready to resume his seat on the train.
Dorothy Russell has made her stage
appearance in "Olympe." The fact
is not given here for its artistic im
portance. She has but a small part
in the new play. But she is the daugh
ter of that queen regnant of theatri
cal beauties, Lillian Russell, her
father being Lillian Russell's second
husband. Edward Solomon. He was
a music composer, and after she had
sung a certain ballad of his a hun
dred times, with its refrain about "a
silver line from your heart to mine"
at the end of each of its sex-en verses
â counting in the average number of
encores, making 400 repetitions â and
Solomon sitting right there in front of
her as conductor of the comic opera
every time she warbled it, gazing up
into her eyes soulfully and waving
his wand hypnotically, and all the
while the silver line carrying a cur
rent of love between his heart and
hers â well, under all those conditions,
what else could she *do but marry
him? Melody is potent with her. Her
first husband, Braham, was an or
chestra leader, and her third, Peru
gini, was a tenor vocalist. Cynthia
Leonard, noted in her day as a scien
tific writer and lecturer on ethnolog
ical subjects, declared that mothers
might give birth to very much such
children as they wished to if only they
put their minds on it. She declared
that uhe practiced what she preached,
her desire being a beautiful daughter
with a wonderful voice, and the result
was the baby who grew up into Lil
lian Russell. Perhaps Lillian did not
believe in her* parent's theory. Any
way, if she tried it she failed. Dor
othy Ilussell is no more than. comely
and she hasn't a singing voice.

PARIS, Jan. 30. â It is understood
here in best informed diplomatic cir
cles that" Russia's. reply to Japan will
be â¢ conciliatory, but will differ in no
essential manner from her attitude al
ready declared. The French Govern
ment has been informed of every step
taken by Russia in reaching a decis
.ion, but the full tenor of her reply
has not yet reached the Foreign Of
fice. . The Gaulois quotes a high au
thority as 'follows:
Â¦ ''Russia .will not declare war unless
she is attacked by Japan. This is the
will of the Czar and the fundamental
base upon which negotiations will be
continued. At St. Petersburg It is be
lieved Japan, despite her belligerent at
titude, appreciates the madness of en
gaging, in war. The Manchurian ques
tion has become a question of honor
with Russia, but If she feels she can
not abandon the region she is at least
disposed to make all possible conces
sions'relating to commerce and open
ports there. In these respects the Gov
ernment will show Itself extremely con
ciliatory- and I have no doubt that an
accord can be reached. With reeard to
Korea. Russia does not contest Japan's
preponderance, but insists upon the in
tegrity of the kingdom, and. while not
objecting to the landing of a detach
ment of Japanese for the preservation
of order, she will consider the debarka
tion of ah army as a casus belli.
" "Russia is ready . to - give satisfac
tion to the legitimate claims of the
Japanese Â¦ oh the condition that her
interests _. be safeguarded. At thl3
hour war depends upon two cventual
ities-^-an attack by Japanese or a local
incident in . Korea necessitating mili
tary intervention.*'

Attack.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. CO.-"It will
be astonishing if Japan remains inflexi
ble." were the significant words of an
official of the Foreign Office in speaking
of the Russian response to the Japanese
proposals, which will be dispatched to
Tokio next week.
The remark was not intended to con-
IIu-Â»ia Gives Japan Opportunity to
. Continue Negotiations.. . Â¦
MAY POSTPONE CRISIS.
If the reply should prove to be com
pletely unsatisfactory to Japan, the
outcome of the conference is manifest.
Should it give -partial satisfaction, an
other exchange of notes is possible, al
though there remains slight room '.for
additional diplomacy.
although It has received various re
ports, the majority of which say that
the reply will be satisfactory. None,
however, emanate from a source
which warrants their full acceptance
as correct. In the judgment of many
just now the character of the note
does not warrant the belief that Count #
Lamsdorff, the Russian Minister of
Foreign Affairs, has given out the
slightest Intimation of Its contents.
Even that carries little assurance, for
the reason that the Russian and Jap
anese conceptions of what constitues
a fair bargain vary materially. The
Government of Japan does not expect
the delivery of the Russian reply for a
few day and when it comes it probably
will be considered by the throne in
conference with the Cabinet and Elder
Statesmen.
The presumption that Russia has
made concessions does not, in thft
least, warrant the conclusion that
.there will be a peaceful settlement of
the existing difficulties. Russia's en
tire proposition will be carefully
scrutinized and every condition and
contingency of the situation closely
weighed.

If was not until the formation of
the Women's International Maybrick
Association in London a few years ago
that any organ ized effort was made.
The president of the, association,. Dr.
Helen Densmore. is a New Yorker.
The vice president, Mrs. Katherine
Prindiville, is a Chioagoan. â â _
Americans have not failed to ex
press sympathy for Mrs. Maybrick.
From time to time in the many years
that she has found her world behind
the bars of Woking. prison powerful
friends on this side of the Atlantic
have labored in her behalf. .
Semi-official petitions from the
members of the Cabinet of the United
States were sent to Lord Salisbury,'
eliciting no replies. The late â¢ Mrs.
Harrison during her life in the White
House sent a letter to the Queen beg
ging her clemency for Mrs. Maybrick.
This letter was signed by Mrs. Harri
son. Mrs. Blaine, Mrs. Foster, wife of
Secretary Foster, and Mrs. Rush, wife
of Secretary Rush. Gail Hamilton
worked early and late with her whole
heart In the case until stricken by
paralysis.
In the deaths of James G. Blaine
and Walter Q. Gresham Mrs. Maybrick
lost stanch friends. They fully be
lieved in her innocence and gave free
expression of their opinions on all oc
casions.
Mrs. Maybrick is a daughter of Will
iam S. Chandler, son of a well-known
lawyer of Mobile, Ala. Her mother,
who is now the Baroness de Roques,
was Carrie E. Hoi brook of New York.
Florence E. Chandler met and married
James E. Maybrick of Liverpool in 1SS1.
She was 18 and he was 42 years old.
In ISS9 Maybrick died and his two
brothers charged the widow with his
murder. She was arrested and tried
for the crime. A letter which Mrs. May
brick charged the nurse to mail led to
her arrest. It was intended for "A.
Biierly, Liverpool." The man was ad
dressed as "darling" and the signature
was "Slorrte."
Arsenic was found in Maybrick's
stomach. Justice Stephens, the pre
siding Judge at the Â¦ trial; delivered a
strong charge to the jury, charging the
defendant with infidelity as well as
murder. His remarks were based on
the guilty tone of Mrs. Maybrick's let
tor which the nurse had given to one
of the dead man's brothers.
Soon afterward Justice Stephens be
came insane and this fact was used by
Mrs. Maybrick's friends to Influence
the Home Secretary to pardon her.
Most officials turned a deaf ear to the
pleadings of many of the most influen
tial people in England, to say nothing
of the efforts of hundreds of promi
nent Americans. Â¦ Since then the efforts
in behalf of the prisoner have been re
peatedly renewed, but heretofore with
out success.
In 1S89 Mrs. Florence Elizabeth May
brick was found guilty of the murder
of her husband, James E. Maybrick.
The Home Secretary, yielding to the
entreaties of many prominent men,
among them Sir Charles Russell, com
muted the sentence to imprisonment
for life.
Mrs. Maybrick, the paper con
cludes, during the last few months in
prison was employed in the lightest
work as a reward for good conduct.
LONDON, Jan. 31:â Lloyd's Weekly
Newspapc'r says, this morning that
Mrs. Florence' Maybrick. the Ameri
can Voman whuJ was serving a life
sentence for having poisoned her hus
band, was released from -the Ayles

o'clock- on the morning . of January
25, on special license. Her "mother,
the 'paper says, had Visited her on
January 23 and evidently was the
bearer of important, news. The gov
ernor of the prison on Sunday con
ferred with the prison officials, with a
view of arranging for the departure
of the prisoner, which was carried out
very quietly."
Mrs. Maybricl$, Accompanied by one
of jhe prison matrons, entered a
closed carriage and drove to Ayles
bury station, wnere she took a train
for London. She drove from Euston
station and from there went to a pri
vate house not (ar from the metropo

period, in order to recuperate and to
await the completion of certain for
malities which will give her a free

The Irish party's tentative support
of the , government . is understood to
be due to the assurances of George
Wyndham. the' Chief Secretary for Ire
land, that he will establish a Catholic
university In Dublin, and will amend
the Irish land purchase act. Despite
this, however, Redmond intends to at
tack the King's speech with a home
rule amendment. It is not likely to be
attended by serious results, but the
schisms of the English parties, swept
by a storm of conflicting fiscal convic
tions, are generally admitted to consti
tute Ireland's opportunity, and Red
mond is now the only leader in the
House who can rely upon the consist
ent, solid supp<5rt of his followers on
all occasions.
THEMES OF' KING'S SPEECH. /
The King's speech is likely to first
deal with British neutrality in the Far
Eastern crisis. It undoubtedly will out*
line the proposed domestic legislation,
the chief item of which will be the pro
hibition of the immigration of destitute
aliens, on the lines now in force in the
United States. Immigrants- who are
permitted to land will be subjected to a
system of registration and will be com-'
pelled to report themselves to the rcg
ictrar of btrths and deaths of the dis
trict in which; they reside. Any dis
trict becoming congested can be prohib
ited to aliens.
Besides the amendments by . Morley
and Redmond, the Government will be
attacked on the report of the War Com
mittee. This will be taken up by Wil
liam S. Robson, the Liberal.
Another amendment will be moved by
The best informed persons say that,
even in the event of a temporary
coalition of 'all the free trade forces,
the Irish party has the deciding vote,
and all indications point to John Red
mond keeping Balfour in power. But,
as Redmond does not make definite
pledges, the Irish party throughout the
session is likely to be an uncertain
factor. That will heighten Interest, and
any day may make it possible for Bal
four to be deposed.
Strenuous efforts are now making to
get the free trade Unionist members
not only to abstain from voting, but to
openly join the Liberal forces in the
opposition lobby. However, even if this
be accomplished and the Duke of Dev
onshire's followers make common cause
with the Liberals under the leadership
of Lord Rosebery. It would not consti
tute a solution of the differences of
opinion which exist between Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman and the Liberal
ex-Premier.
. The labor party completes the triple
division Â¦ of the Liberal free traders'
ranks. . i
John Redmond and the Irish party
make the seventh faction. ' ,. Â¦ â¢ Â¦
ATTACK WILL COME EARLY.
\ In view of this complex state of af
fairs, largely due to events since Par
liament last met, the most astute poli
ticians soundly confess themselves to
be at sea. So many Cabinet Minis
ters, including Joseph Chamberlain,
Charles T. Ritchie and Lord George
Hamilton, will be absent from their ac
customed places on the front bench on
Tuesday that the oldest Parliamentary
hands will scarcely be able to distin
guish between the supporters and the
opponents of the Government cm the
fiscal question.
The Duke of Devonshire, Lord Ave
bury, Mr. Goschen, Sir John Gorst,
Lord George Hamilton, Lord Hugh Ce
cil, Winston SDencer Churchill and
many others identified with the present
party in power will be Balfour's most
bitter opponents the moment the fiscal
question is raised. That will - come
quickly, for John Morley intends to in
troduce an amendment to the King's
speech on this point. It is possible that
Morley may turn out the Government.

days.

ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. SO.â The re
port telegraphed to English papers
from here that the St. Petersburg re
serves have been warned to hold them
selves in readiness is untrue. It is sup
posed that 4Jie writer has fallen into the
hands of joker. Even the
large coritingent of the guard regiment
here and at the Tsarskoe Selo has not
been notified to prepare for active ser
vice, which would be the case if the
supposedly large number, of "troops in
the eastern provinces had proved in
sufficient.
Equally false is the pretended knowl
edge of the reply of Russia, which 13
construed as giving way to Japan's de
mands. Such reports are laughed at in
the Foreign Office. On the contrary, it
will be found that in the very friendly,
almost paternally, worded reply which
this country is about to make and
which it is sincerely hoped will pave
the way to further negotiations. Japan
will be reminded that Russia also has a
minimum and tlat she cannot give any
binding promises to Japan, which coun
try must be satisfied with a sphere of
influence in .Southern V Korea, leaving
the north as the sphere of influence of
Russia.
Russia further urges the Japanese
Government to withdraw all impossible
demands. This completely coincides on
all points with the statement of my
most reliable informants during the last
week. It al3o finds voice in an evident
ly inspired article in the Nojioe Vremya

The Daily Graphic, which to-day re
asserted that the Russian reply was
communicated to Japan on January 27,
was probably misled by a partial
knowledge of the contents of the tele
gram received here from the British
Embassador in St. Petersburg on Jan
uary 26, but which subsequent events
proved to be incorrect.
Baron Hayashi, the Japanese Minis;
ter to Great made minute in^
quiries at the Foreign Office yesterday
evening and was informed that the
British -Government had not received
any further information. Baron Hay
ashi declares the situation, therefore,
is quite unchanged, and presumes that
Minister Grlscom in some way attrib
uted to the British Embassador in St.
Petersburg what really emanated from
Count Lamsdorff.
The Foreign Office, confirming the
statement of the Japanese legation in
regard to the receipt of and the re
telegraphing of the telegram of Janu
ary 26, adds:
"The British Embassador at St.
Petersburg did not express an opinion
as to whether or not the Russian reply
would be satisfactory tp Japan."
On January 26 the British Embassa
dor in St. Petersburg telegraphed to
Foreign Secretary Lansdowne in Lon
don that he had interviewed the Rus
sian Foreign Minister, Count Lams
dorff, that morning, and that Count
Lamsdorff eaid the Russian reply
would be dispatched the same evening,
and that he, Count Lamsdorff, believed
it would be satisfactory to Japan,
These facts were retelegraphed to the
British Minister t<J Japan, Sir Claude
Macdonald, and also were communi
cated to the diplomats who attended
Lord Lansdowne's reception on Janu
ary 27. Count Lamsdorff's intentions,
however, evidently miscarried, for 'the
Foreign Office and the Japanese lega
tion both confirm the statements made
in press dispatches from St. Petersburg
and Tokio yesterday that no reply had
yet been sent and that there was noth
ing to indicate what its real nature
would be. *

Russian Minister there invited Prince
Ching to take such action. The report
that. 1000 Russian troops are to occupy

It has been ascertained that there

to -ignorance, of the complicated ma

Russian Government. The Emperor's

At the Japanese legation the present

The book telld how I perfected my prescription â Dr. Shoop's Restorative.
How by scientific experiment I traced out the causes that bring on chronic dis-
eases. --. Â¦ Â¦ .<Â¦' q
I found Invariably that where there was a weakness, the inside nerves were
weak. Where there was a lack of , vitality, the vital nerves lacked power. Where
weak orgrans.were found, I^always found weak nerves. Not the nerves common-
ly thought of, but the vital organs' nerves. The Inside â tho invisible nerves.
This was a revelation.: Then my real success began. Then I combined ingre-
dients that would strengthen, that would vitalize, these nerves.
That prescription I called a restorative. It is known the world over now as
Dr. Shoop'a Restorative. After that I did not fair to cure one casn in each hun-
dred. In the extremely difficult cases, my failures for five years were one In each"
forty treated. . I found cancer incurable. Cancer is for surgery, not medicine.
Then how to get this prescription to\slck ones everywhere was my thought.
.1 must announce it in the public press. But, thought I. willthey realize the real
truth of my discovery, the real power of Dr. Shoop's Restorative? Then a way
came to moâ like an inspiration. NÂ£I will offer it to the sick on trial. Then they
will know I am sincere â that my prescription is unusual."

principal decrease appears in customs

crease of about $800,000 from internal
revenue sources. . The . statement . will
also show that during the present

BERLIN, Jan. 30. â A prolonged lit

to an end to-day at Plauen, Saxony,
by the court deciding that such a cra
vat Â»s at least undignified, even if not
intended by the wearer as a socialistic
emblem. Dr. Wiedauer, the offender
in question, wore a red tie, as he
avers, inadvertently to a school pic
nic, and thereupon the Plauen Anzei
ger criticized him severely as an im
proper person to teach the youth of
the city. He sued for damages and
the court, in deciding against Dr.
Weidauer, said the editor was quite

proved of red neckwear, which ln

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
In "times past delegations to State
conventions called for the purpose of
choosing delegates to national conven
tions were selected according to meth
ods prescribed by the party governing
bodies. The State Central Committee
would simply promulgate a call, nam
ing the time and place of the State
convention, designating the number of
delegates to which each county or As
sembly district was entitled. Minor de
tails were left to the several county
committees. The old style is set aside
as the new law is now in force. Regis
trar Adams is making all preparations
for compliance with the law, hence the
primary election on Tuesday, May 3,
will be an important event. It Is there
fore the duty of voters to register at
once.
This year there will be a primary
election in San Francisco on Tuesday,
May 3, for the purpose of choosing del
egates to the State conventions. 'Regis
tration for this primary will close April
13. The last day Â«f or a political party
to file a petition with the Secretary of
State for participation in the May pri
mary is March 24. 3904.
The registration office at the City
Hall is open daily from 8:20 a. m. to 5
p. m. All the registrations prior to Jan
uary 1, 1904, have been canceled and
voters must register anew for the next

fore the Republican State Convention

Lieufenant Governor Alden Ander
son, president of the State League of
Republican Clubs, Is making arrange
ments for the biennial convention of
the league at Sacramento some time in
May next. The league meeting at San
Jose in 1902 and the convention at Los

strations. The convention of club dele
grates at Sacramento in May next will
open the Presidential campaign in Cal

WASHINGTON, Jan. 80. â The
House to-day voted - unanimously to
strike from the- urgent deficiency bill
the provisions for the second payment
of mileage to the Senators and Repre
sentatives of this Congress and then
passed the urgent deficiency appropri
ation bill. Thlsr* action was the cli
max of an exciting discussion of the
mileage problem, begun yesterday,
first on the point of order raised
against the provision by Maddox of
Georgia and then on a motion to
strike out, made to-day by Underwood
of Alabama.
Argument on the point of order that
the item was not authorized by law
turned on the question whether this
was the sevond session of Congress or
merely a continuation of the session
convened on November 19 on the call
of the President. Fuller of Illinois
and Cooper of Wisconsin contended
that there had been two sessions,
while Parker of New Jersey Insisted
that, because new sanction had been
given for meeting on December 7, the
status of the session, which he held to
be continuous, was not altered. Little
fleld supplemented his argument, of
yesterday by reaffirming that there
had been no interregnum between the
two sessions.
Tawney of Minnesota as chairman
of the Committee of the Whole ln a
carefully prepared opinion overruled
the point of order against the appro
priation, saying the parliamentary
question as to whether existing law
authorized the payment of mileage
was the point to be decided by him
and the question as to whether the
mileage should be received was i for
the committee to decide. a^I V;::
An amendment by Grosvenor pro
viding for the return of the mileage
to the treasury was agreed to. Under
wood's motion to strike out the pro
vision for mileage then was adopted
without a dissenting vote. The bill
passed the House Just as it came from
Committee of the Whole.
CONTEST WILL OP AX

Bryan* Which Was Given to
Institutions.
Relatives Claim Estate off Francis R.
PARIS, Jan. 80. â The tribunal, of
the Seine to-day heard argument ln
the contest of the will of Francis R.
Bryan, a. wealthy American, -who died
here in November, 1902, leaving $10,
000 to the Philadelphia Historical So
ciety and the balance of his large for
tune to the .South Kensington Mu
seum. London. "Two cousifis, Mrs.
Hand of New. York and Mrs. Dewees
of Mississippi, contested the I legacies.
Their counsel maintained that the
testator was not of sound mind when
he made his will, as he. was under the
delusion that the Archbishop of Paris
and the Prefect of Police had con
spired to poison him.. The Philadel
phia Historical Society and the Kens
ington Museum were not represented.
The court will give its decision by de
fault after eight days from date.
Senator Perkins to-day visited the
Navy Department to Inquire as to the
casue of the reduction of the force at
the Hare Island yard and the prospect
of renewing: a full complement of men.
While the cut at Mare Island has been
about one-third the regular force, he
learned that the reduction in the East
ern yards has equaled one-half. The
cause is in exhausted appropriation,
which makes the move mandatory.
The appropriation has been used up in
fitting out ships for target practice and
other uses, no provision for which had
been made. Â«
CAL.Ii BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W.. WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.â Tlie
protest of the down East cordage
manufacturers against the evident pur
pose of Congress to extend and keep
extended the coastwise regulations of
the American merchant marine to the
Philippine trade found another expres
sion to-day in a bill introduced in the
House by Powers of Massachusetts. A
law now on the books bars foreign
vessels from this trade after July 1 of
this year. Powers' bill introduced to
day aims to extend the time in which
these vessels may operate until April
11, 1909. The Frye bill, against which
the cordage interests made such
strenuous objections before the Senate
committee a few days ago and which
has been favorably reported by both
the Committee on Naval Affairs and
the Committee on Commerce, requires
that all Government and army sup
plies and men be transported in Amer
ican bottoms.
Secretary Root is outspoken in op
position to this bill on the ground of
his belief that there was not Amer
ican tonnage enough to meet the re
quirements, when after July 1 all ship
ping 1 between this "country and the
Philippines will be confined to it, he
feared as a result "tnat shipowners
would enter into a combine and so
raise the rates as to hamper trade. The
fact that the bill contains a provision
whereby the Secretary may ln his dis
cretion nullify this provision; that is,
employ foreign ships in case American
owners do not behave, has caused him,
it is said, the provision being called to
his attention, to withdraw his objec
tions and instead lend his support to
the bill, thus further Increasing the
prospect of its passage.

Allied Provision Trades Council Takes
Action to Revive the Movement
Originated Years Ago.
CLOSER AFFILIATiOX )
OF UNIOXS PLANNED
LONDON, Jan. 30. â The Daily Tele
graph, in- a column editorial on the
Pilgrims' Club dinners in New York
and London last night, remarks:
"While the threat of war is lowering
on the world's horizon, it is a physical
relief to turn this morning to one of
the most significant demonstrations
ever given of the services of
to the growth of International good
will. Last night England and Amer
ica, to all effects and purposes, dined
together for the first time in their his
tory. We question whether there has
been anything in our time of better
augury for the , future relations- of
the two English-speaking peoples, or
more suggestive of the pacific progress
of civilization at large, than the sympa
thetic and simultaneous banqueting in
London and New York at the opposite
ends of the same telegraph wire. If
we think nothing of modern miracles
it is because they have become daily
and commonplace. In modern experi
ence, from : the, political viewpoint,
there has been none more striking in
its way than the unique symposium
whereby two nations yesterday even
ing bridged the sea."
After a description of the London
dinner, the paper adds: .
"Picturesque and genial as the event
was in itself, and appealing "with
singular success, as it does, to the
spirit of friendly good humor, which,
happily, is the dominating factor in
the intercourse between the British
and American peoples to-day, it has
a profound meaning, whereof serious
historians of the future may take ac
count. The nations, in spite of them
selves are being knitted together by
the conditions of modern intercourse
and the spirit of modern science in. a
mesh of subtle, invisible strands,
which is morally as strong as hoops of
steel. If steam and telegraph, for in
stance, had existed in the latter half
of the eighteenth century it is cer
tain that the separation of the race
would never have taken place."
"Consul General Petrovsky, while
courteous to us, seemed to discourage
the appearance of any other than Rus
sians and Chinese in Turkestan, taking
the ground that the question of Chinese
Turkestan is of no great importance to
the world at large" and that it concerns
merely Russia and India.
"The importance of the question lies
in the fact that the taking of the ter
ritory of Thibet, which is under Chi
nese suzerainty, will be dismembering
China. The object of the British is to
make it impossible. for. the Russians to
establish themselves in Thibet, and to
do this effectively they will have to in
stitute some kind of control. Neverthe
less the United States, which is Inter
ested, . must turn her atetntion to . the
back of the empire and keep an eye
there while watching the sea coast.
"With respect to Afghanistan, both
the Russians and British recognize its
value as a buffer state, and do not de
sire to disturb this situation, though
each fears the other may get -in the as
cendancy above the Ameer." â¢
Crosby ' has been invited to deliver
lectures before the London and French
geographical societies. He will not re
turn to New York before the 'last of
February.
C1IIXA TO XOSE TERRITORY.
' "As we could carry supplies for only
twenty days, we endeavored to make
Rudek, in Thibet, whence we intended
to strike toward L'Hassa. Unfortu
nately I lost my chronometer and nau
tical almanac and Avas unable to take
observations. We consequently took a
more southerly course than desired.
It was impossible, to correct the mis
take, because the country was track
less and uninhabited for hundreds of
miles. We could find no openings in
the mountains to Rudek, but we
crosed an unexplored region known as
the White Desert. Our horses died
rapidly and we had but a few days*
supplies left when two of our most
trusted men were sent on the last ani
mals able to travel in search of aid.
They rode 100 miles before they found
any one. At the end of eleven days
our two-men returned with provisions.
The nomads, who are like our In
dians, refused to go into Thibet, so
there was nothing to do except accom
pany them to an inhabited region
known as LitU* Thibet, which forms
part of British Kashmir.
. "Aly purpose in visiting C#ntral
"A3ia was to study the past, present
and racial questions connected with
that region. I did not believe it pos
sible to reach L'Hassa except by force
or In disguise and therefore proposed
merely to go as far as r could.
THIBETANS AUE WEAKLINGS.
"The British expedition under Col
onel Yo'unghusband will be able to
enter L'Hassa. The Thibetans can
not resist. Those I saw were mild and
peaceful people, governed by priests,
who, so far as we know, do not in
culcate them with the military spirit,
which is contrary to the precepts of
Buddhism and Lamaism. The result
of thfr expedition will be some form
of British control. Russia is doing
nothing to prevent its success and I
do not think anything can be done. I
do not believe Russia seriously con
templated acquiring that country, for
if a natural frontier ever existed to
their fempire it certainly lies north of
the vast- deserts and tremendous
mountains which must be crossed be
fore inhabited Thibet can be reached.
"Russia can stand British control of
Thibet, because she will take Chinese
Turkestan as a * set-off. ; The inhabited
part of this territory is- rich and popu
lous. Three oases contain 1,500.000 per
sons, wno live by irrigation. The Rus
sians can and will control the commer
cial situation of all this region because
of its proximity to their railroad. Chi
nese Turkestan is still Chinese tp the
outward appearance, having officials
appointed from Peking, etc., but the
Russian Consul General In Kashgar,
who is guarded by political Cossacks,
is . the real w i>ower_ to, the natives and
Chinese there. Even if they wished to
do so, which I doubt, they would be
powerless to resist the Russians.
CROSS THE WIIITK RESERT.
PARIS, Jan. 30.â Oscar T. Crosby,
the American explorer, has returned
to Paris from a trip to Central Asia,
where he explored parts of Turkestan
and Thibet never before visited by a
white man. On his way to Thibet
Crosby skirted Afghanistan, visited
Chinese Turkestan and later. traversed
Kashmir and . the Karakorum route,
probably one of the most difficult
used by human beings, to India. His
investigation developed that China
was threatened from another quarter,
by her rear door, and that an advance
by Russia and Grdfct Britain in this
direction may become as important in
its possibilities to the United States as
a move of the European powers from
the sea. Crosby said:
"J left the United States last May,
stopping at St. .Petersburg to obtain
permission to pass through Russian
Turkestan. The Russian authorities
were courteous and gave me a letter
of .introduction to General Petrovsky,
Russian Consul at Kashgar, in Chi
nese Turkestan. I took the trans-
Caspian road to Andijan.its termi
nus, meeting on the way thither Cap
tain Anginour of the French army,
who joined me In my journey. From
Andijan we went by caravan to Kash
gar,' Chinese Turkestan.
"At this point the caravan was re
organized and started for Thibet, pass
ing through* Yarkand and Kotan and
eventually arriving: at Polu, at the
base of the Kuenlun Mountains. Here
we beean to ascend the Thibetan
plateau elevations, which range from
15,000 to, 18,000 feet high. We trav
eled at this height for eight weeks,
suffering from the rarifled air and
cold. 1 â¢ : -v.'
John P. Mclntyre, attorney for the
assignee, says of the suspension that
it resulted from the short interest in
cotton hold by a number of the firm's
customers, who failed to respond to
calls for extra margins. The firm's
embarrassment, Mclntyre says, prob
ably will be only temporary.
ATLANTA, Ga., Jan. 30.â The Atlanta
office of A. B. Baxter Â¦& Co. of New

mated at $200,000. The company con

NEW YORK, Jan. 30.â The Financier
says: The striking feature of the
official statement of the New York
banks last week was the new high rec
ord for loans, deposits and cash; also
the large increase in the first two of
these items. The gain In the loans was
less by $1,182,100 than, in the previous
week, while that in deposits was
$7,304,200 lt'^s. The increase in loans,
compared with January 2, 1903, has
been $85,981,000; in cash, $50,028,400^ in
deposits, $126,764,1)00, and in surplus re
serve, $15,587,175. As will be seen by the
accompanying table the deposits are
much above the one billion dollar mark
and they exceed the previous maxi
mum, which was recorded February 21,
1902, when this item was $1,019,474,200.
In that month it may be noted the bil
lion dollar 'mark was reached on Feb
ruary 8, and the deposits were in ex
cess of this sum continuously for five
weeks. The cash grain last week was
$8,466,500, an amount closely corre
sponding with the $8,745,200 estimated
increase, which was based upon the
traceable movements of money during
the week. Loans were expanded $29,
4R7.200. This was doubtless due, as was
the case in the previous week's, to
large corporate borrowings and also
to the liberal offerings of collateral
loans at call and on time by the banks.
The circulation was reduced $402,200,
making Jl.038,000 during the fortnight.
It Is noteworthy that the deposits of
public funds were increased by only
J32.700 during the week. The net gain
in this item since January IS has been
$13,900, indicating: that there has not
yet been an accumulation of these de
posits in New York banks in anticipa
tion of the Panama canal payments.
The daily average of clearings last
week was ?21 5.000,000, an increase of
$2,000,000 compared with the previous
week. The clearings on Saturday re
flecting Friday's business were $226,
531.?GG. It will doubtless be of interest
to ncte that in 1902, when the deposits
were above the billion dollar mark, the
cash reserves slightly decreased and the
surplus reserve fell from $26,623,350 on
February 1 to $12,456,650 on February 21]
The rains in cash by seven banks were
$8,800,000, and only one institution
shows an important loss. Deposits
now exceed loans by $29,391,700, against
$21,238,400 in the previous week. ,

A PESTIFEROUS MEM
Sorrows Up the Scalp Into Dandruff and
Saps the Hair's Vitality.
People who complain of falling hair as
a rule do not know that it is the result
of dandruff, which is caused by a pestif-
erous parasite burrowing up the scalp as
It digs down to the sheath in which tho
hair is fed in the scalp. Before long the
hair root is shriveled up and tho hair
drops out. If the work of the germ is
not destroyed hair keeps thinning till
ljaldness comes. The only way to cure
dandruff is to kill the germ, and until
now there has been no hair preparation
that would do it; but to-day dandruff is
easily eradicated by Newiiro's Herpicide,
which makes hair glossy and soft as

AM ABSOLUTE CURE
For Insomnia, Nervousness and
All Stomach Troubles.
It Makes Old Folks Feel Yonnrj
and Weak Folks Feel Strong.
I Want the Public to Know the Truth-
Know It as I Know'It/ MUNYON.
I BELIEVE there Is a cure for every
disease â I believe that human Ufa
can be prolonged â I believe that people
should die only from old age. and I also
; believe and know that my Paw Paw
Remedy will not only relieve much suf-
' fering. but add many years to the aver-
age life. "
In my opinion dyspepsia and indiges-
tion are the cause of most ailments. In-
digestion means nervousness, sleepless-
ness, impure blood, catarrh, sluggish
liver, kidney and heart affections. No
person can be happy â no person can see
the beauties of life and enjoy its pleas-
ures, -who suffers from any *orm ot
stomach trouble.
I cannot recommend Paw Paw too
highly for all forms of Indigestion and
nervousness. This remedy also acts won-
< derfully well on the liver, blood and kid-
neys, but I believe its greatest office is
Its marvelous effect upon the stomach
and nerves. It is really a nerve food and
vitalizes
It gives exhilaration without intoxica-
tion. It does what whisky_ or beer can-
not do. It relieves the nerve tension. It
stimulates every fiber and puts into act-
ive force every tissue of the V>ody. It
lifts one into the altitude of hope and
holds him there. It Is a bridge that en-
ables the weak and sickly to cross dan-
gerous places. It feeds and nourishes
the nerves, so that the blond corpuscles
will be constantly revitalized, and ths>
losses of the vital forces will be almost
imperceptible. In other words. It will
Kapply a sufficient quantity of l^ve mat-
ter to take the place of waste.
Instead of irritating the nerves and
stomach, it soothes and strengthens
them. Almost every human being some
time requires a stimulant. NOT ANjAL-
COHOLIC STIMl.'LANT. not a stimulant
that will buoy up for a moment and then
cast down to lower depths of depression.
, but a stimulant that will give an abiding 1
strength and lasting force.
My Paw Paw aids the stomach to di-
Best hearty foods and to make good, rich
blood, which asaln in turn strcngtltenst
the nerves, vitalizing all the tissues, and
soon produces muscle tissue, bone.
It is my opinion that the clergymen in
this country could do no greater service
for the cause of temperance- than to ad-
vocate the general "use of my Paw Paw.
for by its use drunkenness would be les-
sened and the morals ,tnd health of. the
community greatly ijriprpved.
A wife whose husband ia addicted to
drinking can do nothing better for her-
self and family than to get a bottle of
this Paw Paw. and whenever her hus-
band feels the need of a tonic give him a
tablespoon of Paw Paw. She will rtnrt
that he will soon lose all cravings for
strong 1 drinks â that his appetite will
soon become natural; that hia nervous-"
ness and lonjcinp for excitement will dis-
appear, and he will be perfectly satisfied
without alcoholic stimulants and harm-
ful beverages. MUNYON.

Monday Horning, Feb. 1, at |0 O'clock, the Entire Stock of Pianos and Playeij
From the ManYais Music Co. Will Be on Sale in the Warerooms of
The Wiley B. Allen Co., Making the Occasion of This Big Deal
A GREAT ERfl FOR PlflNO BUYERS.
The Mauvais Music Company accepted a spot cash offer for their busi-
ness. We did not think the offer would be accepted; we do not need these
pianos. We are going to sell them. The sale will begin Monday morning,
February 1, at 10 o'clock. The doors admitting customers will not be
opened until that hour. Buyers will be surprised at the number of plano3
offered for sale and the prices put on them will create a sr'isation.
Your credit is good. Just put a lew dollars in your pocket and pay the
balance at your convenience. What we are determined to do is to dispose
of these pianos immediately. We are obliged to pay big rental 1 for ware-
house privileges and this we want to stop as soon as possible. Before we
â¢ thought of buying the Mauvais business we had ordered heavily from our
factories East, particularly as the freicht rate is to be advanced, and the
.consequent result is that we have an over-abundant supply of pianos that i
must go on 6ale for much below what they are worth or what they are sold
for in other parts of the country. '?
Remember that tr-*se pianos offered for sale are in the main high-
grade and most valuable. They are the pianos which have given the old
and revered music house of the Zcno Mauvais Company a most enviable
reputationâ the Behr Bros., Schubert, Wissner, Baumeister, Stodard-Smith
and Barnes and many oti^-r makes in uprights and grands, and all these 1
pianos, without reserve, will be offered for sale for about t half what they*
have been sold for heretofore.
Pianos delivered to any railroad station within a radius of 200 miles.
Piano merchants can buy any of these pianos at the prices at which they
are now offered and make a profit over and above that which they make
when buying Â»t their regular wholesale prices. . *
There are thousands of families la and about San Francisco that need a
piano, and tt>ere are thousands of reasons why they should, buy right now.
The prices placed on these hundreds of pianos should wind up the sale In
short order, and those who come first of course will get the benefit of
first choice.

OMAHA, Jan. 30.â After an absence
from Omaha for thirty-two years, while
his relatives "believed him dead, J. P.
Victor Ceedberg has been found at
Fresno, Cal. Ceedberg wrote to Chief
of Police Donahue for information
about the members of his scattered
family. This is the first word that had
been heard of him since the sensation
due to his mysterious disappearance in
1872. The communication does not give
a reason for the man's disappearance
nor his Ions silence. It merely says
that he has accumulated wealth and
wished to ascertain if any members of
his family are living.
- Only, the old settlers remember Ceed
berg. He was one of the business men
when Omaha was a village. He left his
dwelling on his way to work one morn
ing and was not seen in Omaha again.
Detectives spent months searching for
the man. No reason could be imagined
for his disappearance.
One of Ceedberg's sisters, Mrs. Anton
C. Althaus, is now In Portland, Or.,
with a son, Charles. Two of the Althaus
children are in this city. Ceedberg's
mother married O. P.' Anderson and
died at Deer Lodge, Mont., about six
months ago. His father has been dead
many years. Ceedberg told the Chief
that he hoped to find his parents living.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 30. â For the
first time in many years the Treasury
finds itself without any gold*;oin in its
vaults. It is explained that this con
dition is the result of an unprecedented
demand for gold certificates during the
time when the mints have been fully
employed in coining Philippine silver
and subsidiary silver for the United
States. The Increased demand for gold
certificates, which could only be is
sued for gold coin in the treasury,
came about through the needs of the
large banking institutions in the great
commercial centers which had large
amounts of notes of small denomina
tions on hand which they wished to
exchange for gold certificates of larger
denominations. The Secretary has
given instructions fon the mints at
Philadelphia and San Ifrancisco to be
gin the coinage of double eagles on
February. 1 and to work overtime un
til a sufficient supply has been coined
to meet all demands.

CHICAGO, Jan. 30. â One-lfalf a
million cartridges were exploded on
the lake front this afternoon in an
experiment undertaken by dealers in
ammunition to prove to the members
of- the Fire Department that such ar
ticles were not a source of danger
during a fire in the building in which
they are stored.
The cartridges exploded ,with con
siderable force, but beyond flinging
the metallic shells about 100 feet from
the fire, gave no evidence of destruc
tive power. The cartridges were in
boxes, which were piled'and a bonfire
made of the lot.
After the test the fire marshals who
witnessed it admitted that there seem
ed'to be no danger, but all of them
were of the opinion that no fireman
would enter a . place where such
threatening noises prevailed.

The tragic termination of the prose
cution and career of Whitaker Wright
was made the text of moralizing in the
press and in Wall street circles, which
was not calculated to dissipate any
current doubts and suspicions of meth
ods of speculative leadership. An in
fluence of the same kind was exerted
by the action of the Stock Exchange
authorities in striking from the list of
securities quoted on the exchange
those of an industrial corporation.
The published details of the efforts
made to effect a compromise of the
embittered dispute of the parties to the
shipbuilding organization were of ad
ditional weight in the effect upon the
sentiment thus aroused. Reports of
net earnings of railroads, f or December
published during the week were not
calculated to foster a speculation for
the advance. Their Influence was un
derrated to a degree by. the inclusion
of the favorable Union Pacific state
ment and the coal carriers in returns.
But the Atchison statement, showing
the growth of operating expenses for
the first time overcoming the gain in
gross earnings, with a resulting decline
in net earnings, gave a strong impres
sion of similar forces at work In the
railroad field as a whole. A harden
ing market for time loans served as a
warning that the period of piling up
of cash reserves in the . New York
banks is coming to its. normal conclu
sion, promising a limit to the possi
bility of enormous loan expansion at
the rateiwhich has been in progress by
the- New* York .banks since. the begin
ning of the year. ~~
.The bond market has shown some
sympathy with the reactionary ten
dency of stocks and business has de
clined in volume. United States .twos
and old. fours have declined % and
the threes coupon have advanced Y*
per cent on call during the week.
WRIGHT'S DEATH DISCUSSED.
There has Been little evidence of any
genuine investment demand for se
curities or of any important liquida
tion. The highly professional charac
ter of the operations and the artificial
character of the advance have awak
ened a feeling of distrust and skepti
cism toward it from the first. The
movement has had to contend this
week with several positive reactionary
factors besides. That of the war un
certainty has been somewhat' in evi
dence, but is of questionable force. In
several days the stock market resisted
tlir-. influence of the war depression
on foreign exchanges and on days
when the decline was attributed norni
r.ally to the war scare the commodity
markets failed to' bear out this hy
pothesis, cotton continuing to advance
and grain holding back. Of much
greater influence was the decline in
confidence over the revival of the iron
and steel industry. This influence
was directly shown in the weakness of
the United States Steel securities, but
was of decisive effeot on general sen
timent. Consultations during the week
to bring about an agreement among
the Southern iron producers were re
ported to be futile, either for fixing
prices or making a plan for merging
the companies. Rumors were in per
sistent circulation during the week
ol 11 cut in steel rails, and some of
the important Western railroad inter
ests were outspoken in their dissatis
faction with the price scale on the
ground that they did not get in the
advantage of Eastern railroads from
the carrying of steel products as an
offset to the high price paid for rails.
The Iron Age was also frankly pes
simistic over the trade outlook. A re
action in the copper market was re
garded as of almost parallel signifi
cance in the iron trade and was of di
rect effect upon Amalgamated Copper,
in which an active speculation was in
progress. The events of the week had
the effect of reviving discussion on the
subject of methods of promotion and
organization of corporations and the
sent.'mental effect was not favorable to
the market.
The New York banks are putting
large funds into commercial paper
from interior points and large loans
have been made on sterling collateral,
so that the rapid growth of the loan
account is regarded as sound and
safe. But there is a growth of con
servatism in the feeling about extend
ing credits for speculative commit
ments in the stock market. It is point
ed out that the increase of banking
reserves last year came to a halt in
the last week of January, while the
loan expansion proceeded from that
time to February 21, to the extent of
1 70,000,000. From February 7 to
March 14 last year the New York
banks lost over $30,000,000 cash and
the surplus in the same time declined
527,213,800. These conditions and
precedents are a force in causing a
halt in the sneculative movement.
Foreign influences to-day were slight,
but were favorable to higher prices.
There has been a decided falling oft
in the activity of this week's stock
market and the animated operations
of a powerful organized party for the
advance have been somewhat less con
spicuous. Measures of support for
prices have not been altogether aban
doned and the pressure of * sales to
take profits has not been formidable.
The principal interest attaching to the
market has been in the effort to trace
the operations of the speculative lead
ers, with the purpose on the part of
the traders to follow their operations
or to meet tfiem as an available basis
for their own counter operations.
FEELING OF DISTRUST.
LOAX ACCOUNT SAFE.
NEW YORK, Jan. 30. â Trading in
stocks was listless to-day and the
changes in prices were trivial. The
market moved hesitatingly through
out the session, but closed heavy at
practically the lowest. The early trad
ing showed a disposition to carry
prices upward in spite of the free sell
ing of United States Steel preferred
and discouraging opinions current
over the iron and steel outlook. Prices
gave way after the publication of the
bank statement. The items of depos
its reached a new record figure to-day
and loans and cash reserves' went
tibove last week's record figures. The
changes in the various items were not
fully up to last week's unprecedented
records, but the increase in â¢ loans,
with last week's and one other ex
ception, has never before been equaled
and the increase in deposits never be
fore with last week's single excep
tion. The loan item of the clearing
house banks is now close to the bil
lion-dollar mark. The week's gain
in cash is considerably in excess of
the preliminary estimates, but was
not sufficient to make up the increas
ed reserve requirement from the enor
mous growth in deposits, so that the
surplus is slightly impaired.

"Hi man Is I^ost â Tbere Is a Sure Care
for Every Weak Man." â Dr. Ferris.
It is mine to give to whom I will and
my works go before me. Doubt not!
I ask no man to believe me, but I give
to every weak man free this priceless
boon and it restores him instantly to
the strength and powerful vigor of
youth. With this marvelous, mysterious
compound, which I have discovered
only after a lifetime devoted to search
through all the realms of science, and
tho archives of the ancionts, it is possi-
ble for every weak man to have for his
own the glorious manly power, the un-
tiring: visor and the long life of the
patriarchs of Bible times. # With this
mysterious compound no weak man
will ever again be troubled with impo-
teney, vital losses, niphtly emissions,
spormatorrhpa, v.iricotele. prematur-
ity, defective power or lack of vital
energy.
Send me no money. It is my duty,
g-uided by an- Unseen Hand â it is my
mission on earth â my life work â to lift
tip the fallen, heal the wpak and cure
thÂ«> maimed or undeveloped; and to ev-
ery man who has lost his vital power
nr finds it -.vanlng, I send my message
of love and peace and health. I can
save him and ,1 will pave him and re-
store him to many years of happiness
and the imoetuous vitality and vigor-
ous manhood cf perfect health and
youth.
Remember, it matter* not how old
you are: it matters not how you lost
your manhood, or when you lost it. It
matters not what doctors or scoffers
,say. This is no ordinary drug or stim-
ulating method of treatment, but it is
the vital FDark of life itself, and -it
matters not how many remedies and
doctors hav* failed, I have repeatedly
and instantly renewed the youth of old
men. My secret compound never fails.
I have often instilled into jaded men
new vitality, health and strength. For
worn-out men I have oft kindled. In an
instant, and to stay, the sparkling \ '-
tality of youth. Write to me to-day
and tell me in strictest confidence all
about your case. My private address
is Dr. C. Sargent Feiris, 3C8 BtraVn
building, Cleveland, Ohio, and I urge
every weak man to come to me, for I
will pive him undying strength, the su-
preme Joy and happiness of perfect
manliness. My wondrous discovery has
Ktartled tbÂ«? world by its miraculous ef-
fects, yet I seek not fame nor glory. It
suffices me if I may be the humble In-
strument of Nature's greatest power ia !
bringing all men into the enjoyment of
their true manliness and I do 'it free.
In the time allotted to me here on :
earth I shall do, all that in my power '
lies to give my fellow men the benelH of
this great secret and my reward shall
be in the knowledge that I have done
unto others as I would that others
should do unto me.

nine and four-fifths seconds was the
record made on the Ormond-Daytona
Beach course to-day by W. K. Vander

Automobile Association championship
at this distance, open to all. The pace
figures out seventy-three and one-half
miles an hour, the best record ever
made in America, and almost as good
as any straightaway record for that
distance in the world. On this long
race Mr. Vanderbilt managed his ma

turns,, necessitated by using' the ten

skill and daring. On completing
the twenty miles his machine
left its tire marks just four feet nine

Soundings taken yesterday on the Co

scratching of the big dredger Chinook,
any slight increase of depth being
plainly the pesult of the jetty work
and not of the dredger.
The statement does not reflect on
the certainty of' improvement when
the Chinook gets to work, but it mere
ly a statement, of facts verified by the
most reliable pilots on the bar, and
which will receive official indorsement
when the survey now under way is

Astoria have indicated that the
Chinook had already practically re

Special Dispatch to The Call
Early in December it is alleged that
he wrote to H. D. Peairs, superintend
ent of the Haskell Indian School at
Lawrence, stating that he had a large
party of Indian boys who desired to
enter the school and asked that trans
portation be sent for them.
T-he transportation was sent, but
when the supposed wards of the na
tion arrived it was found that all of
them were Mexicans. Kokas is said
to have herded these Mexicans to
uether. promised them good jobs at
Lawreuce, Kans., and then sold them
the transportation which he had re
ceived from the superintendent of the
Indian school.- . - â¢ , ,
When the fraud was discovered he
fled and wai traced through various
cities. To-night. he was arrested at
the postoffice while receiving his mail.
He trlÂ«*d to escape, but was overtaken
anÂ«Â» _^.iÂ»dued after a fight. The Gov
ernment officers assert that there are
charges, against him, the nature of
which they are not ready to make
public.

because Ragan had been leasing the

A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal says: "I advise
Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges to all pa-
Uents suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver Is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but 25 cents a box at. drug
stores, and although in some sense a.
patent preparation, yet I believe I get
more and better charcoal in Stuart's
Absorbent Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."
Charcoal effectually clears and Im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminentfy safe cathartic.
It absorbs the Injurious gases which
r oiiect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the best
< harcoal and the most for the money
is in Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges;
they are composed of the finest pow-
dered willow charcoal and other
harmless antiseptics in tablet form or
rather in the form of large, pleasant
tasting lozenges, the charcoal being
mixed with honey. ; â¢â¢.:; "â¢
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use. but, on the contrary.
Exeat bonefit-
.Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of It the better; it: is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
pases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines c and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
>moking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Xeirly everybody knows that char-
coal is -the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature,. but
few realize its value wherr- taken into
t he human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose. .
in Preserving: Health and Beauty.
Few People Know How Useful It Is
THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.

128-133 EX.X.XS ST., Above Powell,
. SAN, FRANCISCO.William Davis, an â¢ actorâ ha !â was
before Judge Mogan yesterday on â¢ the
charge of having attempted to defraud
the keeper of the Gait House,* at 1206
Market street. The claim of the land
lord was based on the; fact 'that 'Davis
came to the hotel penniless and ill and
was taken care of : to the extent of
$52 r>0, which he subsequently refused
to pay. Among* the items was a bill
for medicine and . medical attendance,
Ada Brown, comely but boisterous, was
rehelrsiug the disrobing scene of Sadie
Martinot in "The Turtle" at Fourth and
Minna streets Friday afternoon. The
sbb-ked inhabitants of the vicinity fair
ly boiled into the basements in an en
deavor to escape the scene. A police
man interrupted the performance and
took Ada to jail. She told him she was
a lady, and reinforced the assertion
with such a string of picturesque pro
fanity that for a time the policeman
was almost shaken in his conviction
that. she was a proper subject for de
tention.
Judge ' Mogan adjudicated her case
yesterday, and after he had heard r all
the glaring particulars he sent Miss
Brown to the County Jail for six
months, where she will never be late
for rehearsals and may learn to aban
don altogether the Martinot role.

his wife with failing to provide for two
minor children. He is a Prussianized
Russian and a bricklayer by occupation.
His wife runs a lodging-house at 127
Eighth street and is fairly prosperous.
Olfchefski protested strongly against
his arrest on the charge. He said his
wife made more money than he did,
and so harried him that he could not
remain at home. The special prose
cuting attorney asked him why he haa
changed his name to Fred Smith.
"I tells you," said Olfchefski. "That
foreman he Bars tome, "Young fellers,'
he says, 'that name is fierce. Every

enlist the support of not only the mem
bers of the Rebekah branch of the or

deep was the chasm between the old
couple that even the honeyed advice of
the Judge failed to bring them together
again. The charge aginst the husband
was dismissed.
Mrs. John Nation secured the ear of

Tillie Whiting was a brand plucked
from the burning by Judge Mogan yes
terday. She is 15 years of age, but she
has the appearance and manner of a
girl several years younger. She had the
misfortune to contract a matrimonial
alliance with tt thief, who is now doing
time in the County Jail. From that sad
experience she started on a downward
path, which was. only checked by her
arrest ac a vagrant.
At her first hearing she was defiant
and barely escaped a sentence of im
prisonment. Yesterday her mother was
in court to pfead with and for her.
The girl broke down and sobbed in her
mother's arms until she became hys
terical and had to be removed from
the courtroom. She promised to go
horn" with her mother and be good,
and was discharged. Her stepfather
was in court and promised the Judge
that he would give her a good home

contained in a lodging-house at 26 Sev

all that it. was worth. It is further
alleged by the prosecution that Miller
is a brother of Castsiftes. and that
many swindles of similar character
have been perpetrated by the two de
fendants in the same manner. A num
ber of other complaints are said to- be

Samuel Sproat. one of the two broth
ers accused of obtaining 560,000 worth
of merchandise from wholesale mer
chants during the time the Sproat Mar
ket was in existence at Seventh and
Market streets, was dismissed yester
day by Judge Cabaniss. The ground
of the dismissal was- that the com
plainant did "not allege facts sufficient
to. constitute a charge of false pre
tense. The special "prosecuting attor
ney admitted that the complaint was
defective and acquiesced in the dis
charge of the defendant, although he
pleaded that the court should take the
matter under advisement to allow the
prosecution to frame a new. complaint.
The Judse stated that if the defend
ant had been released. on ball he would
have been inclined to entertain such
a request, but as Sprc-at had been con
fined in jail pending the hearing of
the case the Judge felt that he could
not consent to deprive the defendant
longer of his liberty. The prosecution
intimated that other complaints against
the defendant would be drawn and
warrants applied for en additional
charges.

of a cannery in San Jose, who sold
goods to the Sproat Bros, for a pe
riod extending over a year and a half,

testimony signally failed to make a
case against the defendant.

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets actually
dt> the work assigned to them. They re-
lieve weak and overburdened stomacha
of a great portion of digestive action.
Their component parts are g identical 1
with those of the digestive fluids an!
secretions of the stomach and they sim-
ply take ud the grind and carry on
the work Just' the same 9s a good,
strong, healthy stomach, would do it.
On this account Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are perfectly natural in , their
action and effects. They do not cause
any unnatural or violent , disturbance
in the stomach or. bowels. They them-
selves digest .the j food Â¦ and : supply the
system with all the nourishment con-
tained in what is eaten and carry out
nature's plans for the sustenanoe and
maintenance -of the body.
' How much more sensible Is th'.s
method than that employed by many
sufferers from weak stomach. By this
means the body and brain get all the
good, nutritious food they need and the
man is properly nourished and equipped
to carry on his work and perform his
duties. He could not possibly be In
proper working condition by starving
himself or employing some, new fang-
led, insufficient food that does not con-
tain enough nutriment for a year-old
baby. A strong man doing strong work
must be properly fed and this applies
to the brain as well as the body.
.: Stuart's Dyspepsia. Tablets, by re-
lieving" the stomach of Its work/enable
it to recuperate and regain -its normal
health and "strength. Nature repairs
the worn and wasted tissues Just as she
heals and knits the bone of a broken
limb, which is'of course net used dur-
ing the process of "repair.
Stuart's ; Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by all druggists at 50 cents a box
and they are the one article that the
druggist does not . try to sell something
in the place of that's "Just .as good."
Thelr : ,unqualifled merit and success and
the universal demand for them has
placed i them within the reach of every
oibe. ;
Food taken Into the Stomach which,
from the nature of the rood'or the con-
dition of the stomach, is not digested,
is worse than no. food at all. This is a
true statement as far as it goes and a
great many dyspeptics go only this far
with their reasoning. They argue with
themselves that because their stomachs
do not do the work given them, th>vy
must be given less work; in other words
they must be starved. It would be Just
as sensible for a business man who is
ur.abl* to do all his own work to cut
down his business to his own capacity
as it is for a man to starve himself to
relieve his stomach. The sensible busi-
ness man employs help and goes for-
ward with his business. Likewise the
sensible dyspeptic will employ help fur
his stomach and give his .body proper-
nourishment.

THE GREAT REPUBLIC â T. G C
City. The steamer Great Republic
was wrecked on Sand Island April 10
1879, while on the voyage from San
Francisco to Portland. Sand Island is
about five miles inside of the Columbia
River bar. The vessel had at the 5me
579 passengers and 92 oflicers and
crew. In getting the passengers ofT
the last boat to leave the ship was
capsized and the first and second offi
cers, boatswain, carpenter and ten
men were drowned.

to see that this institution at Berkeley, the capstone; or
our structure of civilization, must receive recognition and

AT Jhe annual dinner of the Actors' Benevolent
Fund, recently held in London, something of a
sensation was causer' by the address of Beerbohm
Tree, who intimated the possibility of an open rupture
between the theaters and the music halls. Mr. Tree
announced m that he . has " no, objection to the music hall
when it maintains its place, but that he does object very
strongly to what he called the "musichallization of, the
drama." He went on to add that there is ample room
and r support in Great Britain for both the theater and
the music hall, but that unless the aggressions of the
music halls were checked the drama would be degraded
and the legitimate stage. reduced to bankruptcy.
In reporting that portion Tof the address iii which IMr"
Tree described the, relations existing between the' music
hall and the theater, the Daily; News quotes him as
saying: "
"The existing law, passed in 1843, gave to the theater
the right to present stage plays, as it gave to music halls
Â¦the -right to a general entertainment at which smoking
and drinking, and in : some cases: promenading,. were per
mitted in the auditorium. iThis'law nobody had attempt
ed to alter. It had been widely, stated that an f arrange
ment- had 'been, come, to between' theater and music-hall
The dragnet of the . investigation of alleged postal
frauds has landed another big prize in the person of
United States Senator Burton of Kansas, who is accused 1
of offenses serious and varied. The natural sensation
created by' Burton's arrest is greatly modified by the fact
that in this inquiry particularly accusation is not con
viction.
THE BRITISH DRAMA.
General Sir Frederick Lugard. King
Edward's Governor, General of Nigeria,
a huge dependency in the west of Af
rica, nearly the. size. of all Europe, has
excited the ire of missionary societies In
England by issuing a / decree strictly
forbidding the inauguration of any
missionary enterprise into the great
sultanate of Kano, which he has recent
ly, added to the British empire. The
people of Kano are the most fanatical
of all Mohammedan populations, and it
is perfectly certain that serious trouble
would arise were they to hear abuse
and ridicule hurled at the Koran and at
their; faith generally by missionaries
whose zeal outruns their, discretion. Sir
Frederick takes the ground that the
country must first be allowed to grow
accustomed to British administration
and to Â¦ the fact that the latter in its
non-Christian dependencies holds rig
idly aloof from all/proselyting methods.
Moreover, like many others who have
experience ; of semi-barbarous" people, he
is of the opinion that" Mohammedanism

The London Daily Mail reports a
lecture by a scientist in which some in
teresting facts upon animal heredity
were adduced. It says:
"Professor Ray Lankestcr, In his con
cluding lecture on extinct animals at
the Royal Institution on Saturday,
demonstrated how erroneous it is to
suppose that living animals are on the
whole smaller in size than their extinct
predecessors were.
"In the miocene strata remains had
been unearthed which proved that at
one time there existed elephants as
small as a Shetland pony or a New
foundland dog. The horses of the pres
ent day, too, especially the great Flem
ish dray horses, were of far greater size
than _ any 'fossil horses* of which we
had information.
"In former ages sharks attained Im
mense proportions. Some teeth of one
of these monsters were exhibited in
contrast with the teeth of a shark
known to measure thirty feet long, and
whose mouth' is two feet across. The
fossil teetH* were four or five times as
large, and judging from this compari
son and other circumstances .. natural
ists'are of opinion that the. extinct
shark must have measured eighty feet
long and have been capable of taking
three or four persons Into its mouth
at once."

- "Nowhere in the United States have
experiments with the growth" of euca
lyptus trees been carried to such an ex
tent as in the little valleys along the
stretch of the Pacific coast. The euca
lyptus, be it known, is the tree which
some scientists say is destined to save
the world from a famine of wood.
Those who are familiar with the tree's
growing records in that district are
confident in its ability to perform that
feat if it should ever be called upon to
do so, which is not probable.
"One Elhvood Cooper, who owns a
big ranch a few miles north of Santa

What can be done in that way in North Carolina can,
of course, be surpassed in California; it is therefore to
be hoped the industry will be taken up extensively by
persons who have sufficient patience and skill to estab
lish it on a profitable! basis.
a RECENT report from the North Carolina agri-
Z\ cultural experiment station says: "Public interest
Â¦*Â¦ *â¢ in the " revival of silk growing in the United
States continues unabated. Substantial progress has
been made during the year just closed and prospects
are good, for an increased output of silk cocoons this
spring. Silk growing associations are being formed ini
many States, and public schools are introducing the
study into their system." The report then goes on to
give a brief review of the latest formed associations and
enterprises undertaken for silk culture in the various
States, and concludes by saying: "Silk culture in America
has come to stay."
In this widespread movement California, of course,
has a part, though up to this time it is by no means a
great one. It is in fact so small that in the report under
review it is 1 summed up in the brief statement: "In Cali
fornia, the industry is centered about /San Diego, where
there are quite a number interested." While that state
ment does not do full justice to what is undertaken here,
it is still fairly accurate; for as yet we have not taken
in this industry anything like the interest it merits. That
reproach, however, will not long be ours. Some of our
foremost and most successful business men" are engaged
ill working out plans for establishing the silk industry in
California on a scale of considerable magnitude, so that
within a short time all reports of the progress of Ameri
can silk cultivation will have to give us a good deal
more than a short sentence like the one quoted.
At present the people of the Southern "States, aided
by. the General Government, are doing more to promote
the silk industry than those of any other section. What
is reported to be a very successful experiment is operated
by the Tallulah Falls Company in Georgia and the
plant is being increased. Concerning the advantages of
the industry the report says: "When carried on as a
household industry to occupy spare time of the women,
children and aged or feeble members of the family, silk
growing, cannot fail to "fill an important place in our
social economy. It will furnish useful and remunerated
employment for labor otherwise unproductive. It will
add to the comforts and happiness of the aged and
young and poorer classes of our population. It r will
make country life more bearable. to the young of both
sexes who now look even to life in the factory, towns
as a relief fronv,the hardships of the farm. Silk reels
and silk weaving mills must necessarily follow the es
tablishment of silk farms, and the State which fosters
silk. growing will in the end secure a bountiful reward
in generaUprosperity. North Carolina, can easily and
without detracting from any profitable industry already
established add to the wealth produced in the State
not less than $6,000,000 annually. This is a sum worth
striving for." ' ' u

or that the mother would get up and

Cepyrlffct. 190*. by Joseph B. BowlM.
One of my most fondly cherished
hopes before going to Central Africa
Tvas that I might be able to do some
thing in the way of domesticating the
elephant. To this subject I gave a
great deal of study. The elephant Is
specially adapted as a beast of burden
to this tropical climate in which the
horse cannot live on account of the
tÂ»etse fly. It is well known that the
elephant was in ancient times domesti
cated by the Carthaginians, who em
ployed It in their wars with Rome.
When Hannibal crossed the Alps part
of his army n as mounted upon African
elephants.
Elephants are easily corraled, being
so suspicious of the slightest fence that
they will often keep examining it for
hours before breaking through. Then
they can be trapped by digging pits in
their paths. Some of their paths are
worn down six or eight inches, and they
appear to have been used for ages.
The proverb runs. "First catch your
neh and then fry him." In this case
the difficulty is not in the catching,
but in what comes afterward, but there
iE no difficulty that nerve, tact and
patience cannot overcome.-
The natives ha\e a simple and in
genious device for trapping the ele
phant. AH over Africa are" elephant
pitfalls cunningly covered with brush
in such a way as to look like solid
ground. They are a source of exceed
ing trouble and danger to' the traveler.
These pitfalls are seven or eight feet
deep, nine feet long and four feet wide
at the top, the sides sloping to about
two feet at the bottom. When the ele
phant falls into one of these traps his
body wedges between the sloping sides
before his feet touch bottom. He finds
himself caught in a vise, and the more
he struggles the deeper he sinks and
ihc more lirmly he is held. The na
tives trap the elephant for the purpose
of killinc him; it was my scheme to
trap him for the purpose of catching
him alive. Among the articles included
in my original equipment taken -from
England were chains and ropes and
pulleys to be used for this purpose, and
when these were lost in transportation
from Matadi to Leopoldsville a new
supply Â¦was secured at Brazzaville.
They were found, however, to be un
usable, and had to be abandoned. They
Â«:ere too heavy to carry around by one
who had to travel with a small com
pany of men. Besides, without the help
of some white companions, it â¢would
have been impossible to bring them into
service. The dread which the natives
have of the elephant v.ould not have
allowed them to come Into such close
quarters with him as the manipulation
of that gear would have required.;
Clearly some other method ha . to be
adopted to carry out this pet project.
' *e new method consisted of catching
the elephant when young and training
him up in the way he should go. I
have inis entry in my journal: On
May 21, 1898, 1 captured my first ele
phant. He was an interesting speci
men. On the morning of that eventful
day I ran into a herd or seven or eight
olephants, among which were several
females with young ones by their sides.
It was difficult to get at the right num
ber, as they were moving about in the
bush. I followed them for two or three
hours before getting a shot. Several
times I was in their midst, but they
always started off before I got in sight
of a front Jeg or -eye. I had my Email
bore gun with me and had to be care
ful. At noon the herd began to feed,
and in watching them for a short time
I caught the reflection of a pair of big
tusks, but as their owner was in the
bush I had to guess at the position of
the eye. I took my chance, but the ball
missed the brain, and he ran away
fuming and protesting. A little while
after another came into view nearly at
the same spot. I thought at first that
the wounded elephant had come back.
This time I could see the eye and I hit
the mark exactly. The beast fell upon
her knees and looked like the picture
one has seen of an Indian elephant
crouching to be mounted by his rider!
Her head was swinging like a pendu
lum, her eyes were open and her trunk
lay on the ground. I fired six or seven
shots, every one of them finding its
mark, but, still the head kept swinging
from side to side as if m anger. I
could not understand, how a brain
could stand such a bombardment, and
began to think that it must be made of
cast iron.
Tame Elephants.
.Cromer and Lord Kitchener took ths
same view with the Soudan after its re
conquest from the Mahdi. and that in
India the British Government not only
protects but also honors the Moham
medan faith, according to it the same
respect that It shows to other creeds.
FOR some time past several English clergymen and
others of social influence. in London have shown a
disposition to offensively criticize American
women. It is said that a caÂ£d, a female cabal, at that,
has been formed to make American duchesses feel the in
ability of their nativity and taste the discomforts of so
cial Coventry. They have been offensively spoken of as
"imported persd'nsJ^ and one- clergyman has lamented
their presence and their interference between husband
and wife.Â® - 1 ,
Taken upon its face this charge requires a bill of par
ticulars, for, irP this country, we are unaware that any of
the American ladies married to English titles has ever
appeared ?s co-respondent !a an English divorce cise, or
been chargedlwith incontinent conduct. Perhaps the
charge rjQanscJhat these ladies, by marrying titled Eng
lishmen, have intenered between them 'and the English
ladies who would have liked them for 'wusbands. \Vhile
that is likely to happen in any, marriage, between gentle
or simple, it is a matter not adjudicable, and cannot even
be pleaded in a social contest, for motives of delicacy
which are obvious. . : .. . frv 1

The raid upon our countrywomen expatriated by mar
riage seems to have been incited by the marriage of the
Duke of Roxburghe arid Miss Goelet. That all&ifce was
far less .offensive to American scniini@it than many
others that have taken place. The motives of the Duke
surely were not mercenary, since his largeQ:state and for
tune equal and perhaps exceed, the fortuneO-of the
Duchess. Gallantry requires that we .assume that the
motive of the lady was not to secure a title, but that she
preferred the Duke for the personal reasons which make
affection the motive for marriage with nearly all Amer
ican women. â¢ '
Some of these marriages have gained a title only to
the Americans. The successor to John Churchill, heir to
a title and estate that were derived from the favoritism
of Queen Anne and some luck at Blenheim and Ramillics,
found himself the victim of the profligacy of his imme
diate ancestors, who had incumbcred the estate and sold
its priceless heirlooms, and art 'collections at auction.
As far as known the young man himself is a well
behaved and unobjectionable youth. But he found the
Vanderbilt fortune useful in* completing the rehabilita
tion of the family estate, which had, been begun with the
wealth of another American, Mrs. Hammersley, the wife
of his predecessor as head of the family.
We are. in the habit of deprecating these titled mar
riages by our countrywomen, but' they are our country
women still, and there is a tendency to resent abuse of
them by members of the class into which they have mar
ried. It takes .two to make a marriage, and these hyper
critical Englishmen would better turn their gun's upon
their countrymen who for any reason, but usually to
better their exhausted fortunes, seek American wives.
Our women do not ask Englishmen to marry, them.
.They wait to be asked and consent or refuse, as it is
their exclusive right. If Englishmen will quit asking
them there will be no more accessions to the ranks of
American duchesses.
As far as known our countrywomen sustain them
selves in their new stations. There was a great 'out
break of this anti-American jealousy when Lord Curzon
was appointed Viceroy of India, for it took his American
wife, Miss Leiter of Chicago, to a station next hand to
royalty itself. She appeared at the great durbar at Delhi,
in honor, of the coronation of Edward, as the immediate
representative of the imperial power. '. There were some
ill-timed remarks about the daughter of a pig-sticker,
which she is not, having precedence over the daughters
of a hundred earls who had journeyed to the city of the
Moguls to seethe rajahs ride by on their gold-clad ele
phants. But no one denied that Lady Curzon filled every
requirement of her high position, and queened it as roy
ally as the descendant of any of the barons of Runny
mede.
The fact that really hurts is that our American women
have an initiative, an instinct and an adaptability that
qualify them for any place. Their English sisters arc
slower, less piquant, and fail to make the most of a
.station that is dulled to them because they did not attain
but were born to it. The nobility of England would be
improved by furnishing wives to, our American business
men and artisans. Whatever originality there is in an
Hon. Miss would be brought out as the wife of an/intelli
gent American mechanic, and her daughters would have
the dash of American snap and enterprise which would
fit them for wives of the "nglish nobility. They would
finally give to the noble society of Great Britain a charm
that it has lost by centuries of dull routine and crystal
lized custom;
The American lady is neither vulgar nor ignorant. She
is original, chaste and independent. If she look upon a
coronet with the desire to possess it, among her motives
is the missionary spirit, manifested in the wish to reform
the titled society of Great Britain, which, as far as its
female part is concerned, has not for centuries. given to
letters a respectable, literary character, nor even a new

L-Miel of that city was his ardent

at which his friend Mr. Miel officiated
as clergyman. Everything went
smoothly until the ' cemetery was

a dandy Easterner who, in early days,

AMERICAN DUCHESSES.
My next elephant calf I caught in the
same fashion, using this time a lasso
made of raw hide, which I now carried
with me all the time. He, too.wilted
and died during the weaning process*.
My third and last captive was a very
small calf, which I got when recon
noiterlng a herd of elephants in a
grassy plain covered with ant hills
from fifteen to twenty feet high.' I was
keeping an ant hill between me and
a big tusker so as to get into line with
him. when one of the females of the
herd caught sight of something irfeg
ular in the grass. Her curiosity get
ting the better of her, she came too
close to where I stood in ambush.
When I killed her I found she had a
very young calf, which I caught with
out any trouble, as he stayed by his
dead mother and did not attempt to
run away. I took him to camp, but
had to shoot him a few days after, as
I had nothing with which to feed him,,
and he must soon have starved to
death. He was the only one of the
three of which I got a good photograph.
It was a useles waste of life to exper
iment further, yet I had demonstrated
to my own satisfaction that with
proper appliances. the domestication, of
the elephant is feasible. Elephant
calves about eighteen months old, just
large enough to sleep alone and be in
dependent of their mothers, are the
most suitable with which to work. I
can catch as many Of them as I wish.
The calf does not know how to use his
proboscis, which for some time has
very little strength. He sucks with his
mouth. The tusks are not developed
till later, so that they cannot hurt you
unless they butt you, but with care you
can keep out of their way.
before X could lead him alone. The
camp was five miles distant and we
led him all the way without the least
trouble.
My attention was now given to my
young protege. I offered him thin corn
meal mush mixed with honey, but at
first he would not touch it. But hun
ger is good sauce, and before Ions he
would drink two or three quart bottles
of this pap at a meal. It was not long
before he began to act like a spoiled
child. HÂ» would get mad upon the
slightest provocation. After he had
been with me about four or five days
I would occasionally let him loose, but
he never attempted to run away. He
became almost too familiar. One night
he walked into my tent when I was
asleep and began to poke his proboscis
through my mosquito bar. "When I
looked at him he opened his mouth for
me to give him his bottle, from which
he had learned to .drink without the
aid of a nipple. He became quite tame
and tractable, and would come to me
when I whistled for him. ' \ '. . '
But. alas! my p<at began to show
plans of failing strength. I had no milk
for him, and It was evident that his
corn meal diet did not agree with him.
I tried eggs, but he did not like them,
and when I beat them up 7 into his corn
meal mush he -would not eat it.. I
mashed up sweet potatoes very fine and
mixed them with water, and that he
would hardly. touch.- If I had been pro
vided with condensed milk or with the
infants' foods so much used in the
United States I have raised him.
It was pitiful to see him grow weaker
day by day. until at length he closed
his eyes and went to his mother, to the
place where good elephants go.
While my pet lived the natives came
from far and near to .see him. There
was nothing talked about but "Demba
Crecy" and his baby elephant. I hard
ly knew which was regarded with the
greatest wonder. The natives would
stand afar off with undisguised curios
ity, and. although they were not afraid
of me, they looked as if this elephant
taming business 4 was too audacious to
believe, and asked me what kind of a
fetish I had.
There Spears to be a good deal of justice in the argu
ment of the theater managers, and persons interested in
the maintenance of the best traditions of the stage will
sympathize with thern. Certainly the drama cannot
thrive amid the surroundings of music halls. It must
Qiave a theater of its own if it is to live, and that theater
should not be handicapped by legislation while the com
peting entertainment is left free. Incidentally it may be
noted that it was announced at the dinner that in all
probability a British school of dramatic art would soon
b.c established as a means of promoting the cultivation
of the legitimate drama. The foundation of such a
school would, of course, form a center around which the
classic actors would gather to organize for war against
.the halls. Ifis quite likely, therefore, that the conflict
between the theater and the music hall may be one of
the notable features of London life during the present'
vear.
The unfair element in the situation of which Mr. Tree
complains is that the music hall does not have to f take
out .a dramatic license, arid moreover is permitted to
give with the plays a general entertainment where
smoking, drinking and promenading are permitted. The
theater managers ask to be placed on an equal footing
with their competitors in that respect, saying in the
words of 'Mr. Tree: "If the cry for free trade' in amuse
ments is to be the watchword of legislation, let it be
free trade for the theaters as well as the music halls."
managers, giving to the music hall the right to play
sketches of forty minutes. That was not the fact. There
arc. two points^ to an agreementâ firstly, it" must be
made, and secondly, it must be carried out. ' Not only
had the arrangement never been carried out, but it was
never even made, -though I believe it was recom
mended. At the present time almost all the variety
theaters were performing complete stage plays, many of
them occupying as much as an hour, some an hour and
a half. That seemed scarcely fair." ..

United States Local Inspectors
Bolles and Bulger handed down a
decision yesterday suspending for ten
days the license of T. H. Corning,
master of the steamer Maggie, for
having collided with the Key Route
ferry steamer San Jose on November
18 of last year.
Captain Corning is absent from the
city on a sea voyage and 'is expected
here by Sunday or Monday. Hence
the suspension will date from Febru
ary 1. The inspectors in their decis
ion say:
"Upon investigation of the case and
careful consideration of the testimony,
which is contradictory, we are of the
opinion that Captain T. H. Corning
was negligent and unskillful in not
backing the engines of the steamer
Maggie at full speed when he saw the
steamers were coming together; had
he done so It would have lessened the
violence of the blow, or perhaps have
prevented the collision.
"For reason of such negligence and
unskillfulness we have suspended his
license as master and pilot for a pe
riod of ten days from date of Febru
ary 1. 1004."
The steamers received damage to
the extent of $500 each.

CAPTAIN* CORXLN'G HELD
BLAMABLE FOR COUJSIOX
LONDON, Jan. 30.â A recelvlne ordsr in
bankruptcy has been granted against the widow
of Charles Stewart. Paraell.
"Two trestles, four boards, two ac
tors and a passion" will, according to
the theory of William Birtler Yeats,
the Iri?h poet and dramatist, be suf
ficient material for a theater equal to
the famous Greek theaters of years
ago. The speaker was again greeted
by a large and enthusiastic audience
last night. It was his closing lecture
in this city and he chose for his sub
ject that which he. is most deeply in
terested in. th.e theater. He said when
an Irish national theater was first se
riously considered he thought of
choosing some of the old dramas.
After giving the matter much thought
he came to the conclusion that if Ire
land was to have a national theater
nothing should be produced but Irish
plays. The country is rich in tradi
tion, its language classical and its peo
ple of a naturally poetic turn of mind.
His idea of the national theater is to
preserve these beautiful traditKms and
folklore stories and present them to
the people in an Interesting form in
their own native tongue. This also
means a revival of the Gaelic and the
tightening of race ties among the peo
ple.
So far the movement has met with
success. At its inception actors were
brought over from England, but this
experiment proved somewhat of a
failure, as they had a tendency to
drop their h'R. Interest was awaken
ed, however, the movement got a good
start and now hundreds of villages
have their own companies giving
purely Irish plays. The speaker is op
posed to the use of scenery, holding
that it distracts the attention of the
audience both from the actor and the
lines. At the conclusion of his ad
dress he read a selection from. Dr.
Hs'de's. "Twisting of the Rope" and
also some of his own poems.
William Maloney of 147 San Carlos
avenue, who thought that he had seen
Foeder and Blaise on a Powell-street
car. was taken to see Soeder at the
prison yesterday. Maloney did not
know Soeder and said that he had
rover oeen him before.
The p/iMee 'are having trouble with
their â¢witnesses in the Blaise murder
case. Several of the witnesses have
been drunk and unable to testify. Yes
terday Mrs. Neinlas, Soeder's former
landlady, was found in a drunken con
dition on Stockton street by. Officer S.
Carr. She was taken to the City
Prison, where f=he spent last night.
This is not the first time that the
woman has been under the influence
uf iiquor. For fuur days after Soeder
was arrested" Detective Thomas Gib
ecn was unable to get an intelligent
statement frim her. When she was on
the stanf at the Coroner's inquest and
at the Police Court hearing she was in
a stupefied condition. When taken to
ihe City Prison yesterday Mrs. Neiblas
gave the name of Mary Tobin, hoping
to keep her identity secret.
The woman has been one of the main
reliances of the prosecution. Teresa
Kins, the Barbary Coast witness, is
sick in bed, threatened" with typhoid
fever. The prosecution expected to
ag^ain place her on the stand.
"The fipht between the police and the
Coroner has caused considerable com
ment throughout the city.. Detective
Gibson claims that Coroner Leland
ha? hampered his work. He says that
Lo'.and promised him to withhold the
inquest until the police were ready,
and then put just enough witnesses on
the stand to ascertain whether Blais^
d!*d a natural death or came to his
end by violence. He says that not
withstanding this promise Leland went
ahead with the inquest. "I had sworn
to a warrant charging Soeder with
murder and was compelled to be in the
Police Court to prove the charge." said
Gibson, "but Leland would not give me

UPON A CONSOLIDATION
Notwithstanding the fact that numer
ous comments have been made about
the neglect of commanding officers in
the matter - of making returns to the
adjutant general's office at Sacramento,
there appears to be no improvement In
this line, for in general orders recently
issued from Sacramento it appears that
a very large number have failed to
make monthly returns and* returns of
property within twenty-one days after
the expiration of the time for which
the same were made. The only penalty
visited on- the delinquent officers is to
publish their names in orders, and this
has been done so often that they have
become used to it, and they do not seem
to care whether returns are on time or
not. Â¦
The Attorney General has . decided
that funds appropriated by the State to
organizations of the National Guard
cannot bemused to pay the premium on
fldfclity bonds, given by company com
manders, nor for the payment of Inter
est on overdrafts^ or loans nor for the
payment of expenditures for publishing
in newspapers notices of drills, parades,
elections or other military, asemblages.
In reference to the latter the order has
gone ; forth that , men required for any
NO COIX FOR UNIFORMS.
Many who are interested in the
guard are wondering why the order
appointing Colonel Wilhelm was re
voked and why there should be a
double inspection. They hold that Col
onel Wilhelm. being an officer of the
guard and undoubtedly qualified for
the duties of inspector ,and having
been selected for the purpose on be
half of the War Department, will make
a personal inspection of every or
ganization as required by law and that
it will be done; at the expense of the
United States Government. It is also
said he could have made a report as
State inspector to the commander in
chief of the State soldiery and that in
afttlng for both he would not be acting
inconsistently.- They declare that now
Lieutenant Colonel Koster will make
an inspection on his "own account and
that at no little expense to the State.
The Signal Corps of the Third Bri
gade of the National Guard of Califor
nia, Major F. L. Martin command
ing:, having fallen below the standard
of efficiency, has been by general or
ders disbanded and. ordered mustered
out of the service of the State. Cap
tain A. E. Stearns, Second Infantry,
has been detailed as mustering officer.
Acting on the second order from
Sacramento, Major General Dickinson
has detailed Lieutenant Colonel John
A. Koster, division inspector, to also
inspect the guard.
ORDER CAUSES COMMENT.
There is to be a double inspection of
the National Guard of California this
year. By orders from the Sacramento
headquarters, under date of December
15, Colonel Thomas Wilhelm, inspector
general of rifle practice, who also holds
the*rank of major on the retired list
of the United States army, was or
dered to report to Major General Dick
inson for assignment of duty as In
specting and mustering officer of the
guard of California. Â¦*
For a, long time before that order
was issued it was common talk, and
the fact was announced in the public
prints, that Major Wilhelm was to be
selected for the purpose of inspecting
the guard under instructions from the
War Department, yet he was detailed
as stated. On the 26th inst. an order
was issued from headquarters at Sac
ramento rescinding the former order
detailing the inspector general *of rifle
practice to inspect the .guard on the
ground that the United States general
commanding the Division of the Pa
cific had signified his intention of ap
pointing Major Wilhelm to inspect the
guard.. Two days later General Mac-
Arthur issued an order directing the
major named to make the Inspection
aa expeditiously as possible.
In connection with the steamer Napa
City, the plaintiffs allege that it was
purchased for $9250, which was raised
on the promissory notes of the four
members of the firm. They say that
Hatt has included the cost of this
steamer in his items of expenditure,
and that he claims to be the sole owner
of it.
A suit for an accounting filed yester
day by H. G. Bell and J. M. Graham,
part owners of the steamers Napa and
St. Helena, plying between this port
and Napa, against Captain A.
Hatt Jr. and G. H. Munk, their
partners in the business, reveals the
fact that the steamboat men have not
been getting along very harmoniously
of late. It appears from the complaint
that the plaintiffs are dissatisfied with
the way Hatt has been conducting the
boating business, and they ask the
court to compel him to account for the
receipts and expenditures, for an order
appointing a receiver to take charge of
the business pending the determination
of the suit, and for an injunction re
straining Hatt from interfering.
It is alleged in the complaint that
Hatt has taken unto himself the full
management and control' of the busi
ness and absolutely refuses to recog
nize the claims of the men associated
with him. When they first associated
themselves together Bell put up $3432,
Graham $3000 and Munk $5000, Hatt
agreeing to furnish the money to equip
the vessels or to complete them after
the funds of the others were exhaust
ed. When it came time to determine
the exact interest of the four men, the
plaintiffs, allegre, Hatt claimed that he
had advanced 442,500 and insisted that
he should be recognized as the principal
owner. It is alleged that, though the
other partners demurred to his de
mands, he assumed control, and when
Bell, as master of the St. Helena, re
fused to obey his commands, be dis
charged him and ran the vessel and the
entire business himself.
The plaintiffs charge that Hatt, In
stead of investing $42,500 in the enter
prise, as ht* claims, did not invest more
than $22,000. and that therefore he
should be compelled to account to his
partners for the earnings he took to
himself on a basis of an investment of
$42,500. They claim also that Hatt paid
himself a large salary and did other
things that netted him a larger inconio
from the vessel than he is entitled to.

OXLY AXD T^AST NOTICE.
one for social reunion, and In order
to create new interest In the affairs
of this great association.
The amount of money received by
this association from all sources dur
ing its existence is not Ies3 than
$3,000,000, all of which was expend
ed for the establishment and main
tenance of its hospital and for the
assistance and support of worthy peo
ple that were in need. For the latter
purpose fully $500,000 was expended
in cash alone.
Since then the association has not
only been able to take care of all its
members in the hospital and the
needy Germans for whom application
for assistance was made, but has.
through the receipts from pay pa
tients in the hospital and. from dues
of Its nearly 4000 members and oc
casional bequests, been able to accu
mulate almost $100,000 as a building
fund. 'Although only a little over
twenty-five years old, the present hos
pital is not considered equal to the
demands, and therefore a new hos
pital will be built It is the intention
to erect an absolutely fireproof, mod
ern hospit-1 building, which will cost
anywhere from $300,000 to $400,000
and of which the first wing is to be
started during the present year, ac
cording to plans now under considera
tion. â¢
It Â«s therefore more than probable
that the association will shortly'have
to plan some fair or great festival to
raise funds for this purpose. â¢
The golden jubilee, however, is not
a festival to raise money, but merely
fair netted $30,000, and was the last
festival of any kind that the associa
tion, which, in 1885, paid the remain
ing indebtedness on Its mortgage, has
held for the purpose of raisins funds.
CARE OF THE XEEDY.
George D. "Worswick was legaLly
elected Mayor of San Jose on May 19,
1902, according to a decision rendered
by the Supremp Court yesterday. The
other candidates who went into office
contemporaneously with Worswick and
who 4 Â«?e right to their several positions
wae contested are likewise held to have
been properly elected.
Charles Martin, ex-Mayor, and his
fellow officeholders, who contested the
election, are declared to have relied
on mere technicalities to- thwart the
will of the voters. The contestants as
serted that the whole election was ille
gal because the officers at the polls used
the register of 1900 instead of that of
1902. No fraud is alleged in the com
plaint, nor is it declared that if only
those few whose names were on the
1902 register had been allowed to vote
the general result would have been dif
ferent. The Supreme Court says that
if there were any such law which would
disfranchise otherwise legally qualified
voters it would be unconstitutional. It
is declared that for this reason alone
the complaint is fatally defective.
The court suvs that as the other argu
ments filed in behalf oMhe contestants
are very elaborate it will take time to
answer some of them. The other claims
are found to have no foundation in
law and the judgment of the lower
court in favor of Mayor Worswick and
his fellow officeholders is affirmed. The
opinion is written by Justice McPar
land, with whom Justices Shaw, An
gellotti. Van Dyke and Hcrishaw di
rectly concur.

Jose City Election of Two

Krimminger of the Companions of

Railroad and Fourteenth avenues; on
Wednesday she will visit Robin Hood
Circle in the Alcazar building:, and on
the evening of Thursday she will be

. Xothing daunted, a number of lead
ing citizens called a meeting and re
solved to raise funds so that the asso
ciation could buy a suitable piece of
ground and erect a modern hospital
sufficiently large to answer all fur
poses. 'Within a very few. days $45,000
was subscribed, and a fair, which was
presided over by a number of ladies,
under their president, Mrs. Dr. Bryant,
now Mrs. Goorge, Marcus, was held,
which added $21,372 to the funds" for
the new hospital.' This was in 1878.
In the meantime the association had
purchased property on Fourteenth and
Noe streets, where the hospital 1 is at
present located, for which $70,000 /was
paid. The building cost $80,000 and
the furniture, laying out of the gar
den and other expenses added consid
erable more to the necessary amount
to start the new enterprise. â¢
the doors of the new hospital
were opened the association owed the
German Bank S 80,000, but thanks to
some bequests and the sale of the for
mer hospital lot on Brannan street,
as well as to the excellent manner in
which its affairs -were managed, It
took only five years to reduce the in
debtedness to $40,000.
â¢ In order to wipe out this debt It
was resolved to again call upon the
ladies to hold a fair, over which Mrs.
O. Muser, assisted by Mrs. I. Hecht
and Mrs. F. Hess, presided. This af-
.Owing to' the fact that the old hos
pital was surrounded by lumber yards,
only a 'limited amount of insurance
could be, obtained on the hsopltal and
furniture, so that the society lost the
greater part of its accumulations.
KKECT NEW STRUCTURE.
In view of these facts the primary
.purpose of the organization -was . to
| assist newcomers, 'principally during
the first six months after their arrival
: in California, and, according to the
annals of the association, the calls
1 which were made, even at that time,
by those in need or distress were many,
in fact were larger in proportion than
they are at the present time. But it
soon developed that mere periodical
assistance was not sufficient to take
. care of all, particularly of those that
: were sick, and so within a couple of
; years after organization it was re
solved to build a hospital, for which
purpose the society was incorporated
in 1S57, and the foundation for its hos
pital, which was then located on Bran
Â¦ nan street, was laid.
j Under the fostering care of many of
| the pioneers of German birth, most of
whom have long since Joined the great
majority, the association prospered
and grew. in membership until August,
1876, when its hospital was totally de
stroyed by fire. Fortunately, every one
of the inmates was saved and gener
ously taken care of by the French and
j St. Mary's hospitals. - .
i After several preliminary meetings
it organized and adopted a constitu
tion in 1S54.~ At that time there were
many Germans in California that had
become stranded after trying their
luck in the mines, many of them not
being fitted for such hard work, others
unfortunate in striking the wrong dig
gings.'
t-iely is one of the oldest organizations
of its kind in the city. It has a most
interesting history.
The German Benevolent Society Is
to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary
with. a golden jubilee festival on Sat
urday and Sunday, February 6 and 7.

Hi, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121 POST STREET,
"I had ceased my visits to her for a
time and had given up all hope, when
one morning she entered my office look-
ing like a new woman: the pallor had
disappeared and the lines of suffering
were nearly eradicated from her face.
She told me she had bought at a drug
store for 50 cents a proprietary medi-
cine in suppository form called Pyra-
mid Pile Cure, and had obtained Instant
relief from the first insertion. I made
an examination and found the rectum
In excellent condition, the Inflammation
entirely, disappeared and the swollen
veins in normal condition. \
"I. was so interested in the case that
I had the remedy analyzed carefully,
and was so pleased, with the result, of
the analysis, finding a combination of
the most, healing and scientific reme-
dies present in the Pyramid Pile Cure
and In a more convenient form than I
could secure them otherwise, that I
wrote . to the Pyramid Drug .Company
at 'Marshall, Mich., asking, for their
booklet on Piles, their Nature, Cause
and Cure (which, by the way. Is sent
free), and have since used their Pile
Cure extensively and -with best results
In; my practice. I do not hesitate to
recommend it to you all. It will often
save your.patient from a painful surgi-
cal operation, which In many cases re-
sults fatally." j
Â¦Several famous American physicians
and surgeons wefe recently dlnlngr to-
gether after a session of .a national
meeting held in New York.
"I had a remarkable case this win-
ter," remarked a surgeon present,
whose name as a" specialist in rectal
diseases Is world wide. "My patient was
a woman, a delicate, nerve-racked crea-
ture, who had suffered so fearfully from
the ravages of hemorrhoids that the
knife seemed the only solution of the
trouble, and yet her heart was weak
and her strength so wasted by this
fearful disease that we dared not op-
erate.

The fifty deputy clerks employed in
the office of County Clerk John J.
Greif made their first monthly report
yesterday. It is a creditable one, in
that it shows that though Greif has
been in office 'less than a month he
has caught- up a- month on the work
that ran behind in the time of his
predecessor, A. B. Mahony, and has
also kept the current work up to date.
This showing-is due to the fact that
Greif, instead of making v the men
work overtime, simply required j t-- **
they should report- for work promptly,
at 8:30 every morning and work until
5 p. m. and.that all courtroom- clerks
and Mothers whose time was not fully
occupied -between those hours should
put in their spare time in' working on
the books of the probate department.
One of the innovations in the of
fice is a time book, in which all clerks
are. required to place their signatures
promptly at S: 30 a. m. and at 5 p.-m.
the time jof reporting, off. From this
book the time of each clerk is made
up- and entered in the regular time

BERKELEY, Jan. 3Q.â Four new in
struments and two new buildings were
dedicated to the uses of the students of
the University of California this even
ing at the students' observatory. The
meeting of the Astronomical Society of
the Pacific was made the occasion for
this important ceremony, in which par
ticipated men whose lives are devoted
to the study of the heavens and men
who study them simply because they
like to dabble with the infinite and
mysterious.
The dedicated instruments represent
gifts of friends of the university and
purchases. "William M. Pierson of San
Francisco presented the eight-inch re
fractor, now the most valuable instru
ment at the observatory. Tlje five-inch
refractor, formerly the property of the
late Senator Fair, is the gift of his
daughter, Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs. The
photographic telescope represents the
work of Dr. A. F. Gillihan, a practicing
physician in Berkeley, as designer, and
Valdermar Arntzen as builder, the en
tire instrument except the lens having
been made in Berkeley. The Repsold
measuring machine was purchased for
5850 in Germany.
The buildings that cover these instru
ments are plain but substantial struc
tures. The Pierson refractor occupies a
small building of its own, while the
other three instruments are contained
in a larger structure, having two domes
and two large rooms. Instruments and
buildings are estimated to have cost
510,000. This sum includes the remodel
ing of the old observatory.
HISTORY OF OBSERVATORY.
The exercises this evening were held
in the astronomical lecture room. Otto
von Goldern, president of the Astro
nomical Society, presided, i Brief ad
dresses were made by President Wheel
er and Professor W. W. Campbell, di
rector of the Lick Observatory. They
were followed by Dr. A. O. Leuschner,
director of the students' observatory,
--. "It was through' the- efforts: of Pro
fessorSoule, head of the department of
engineering, assisted by Professor
Welcker, that an, appropriation of $10,
000 for the erection of a students' ob
servatory was secured from the Legis
lature In, 1887. '. It impressed me when: I
first visitedÂ«it in 1889 as a perfect model
of -the Lick Observatory. It was com
plete in its â¢ details and 1 just what it
ought to be. â¢* ..
"In those earlier days the headquar
ters of the. department of civil en
gineering and> astronomy, ' of which the
students' observatory formed the other
part, consisted of one room on the top
floor of? North Hall. .The head. of the
department and one instructor made up
the staff. Not long afterward the bur
den , of instruction in civil engineering
became so great that : Professor Soule
was- forced to ask to be relieved of the
latter, and in 1892 the courses in gen
eral and practical astronomy were as
signed to me, while I still retained my
connection with the department of
mathematics." : , â¢ ,
Professor . Leuschner's address was
followed , by others â¢ speaking on topics
familiar to them. . Dr. R. T. Crawford
spoke upon ' "The Constant of Refrac
tion," Dr. B.'L. Newkirk upon "The
Watson Asteroids" and Dr., Gillihan
upon "The Photographic Telescope."
After: the , speechmaking the guests
were invited to inspect the various in
struments. The intricacies of each in
strument^were explained and a< peep at
the sky permitted.
civil engineering students the astro
nomical knowledge necessary to; their
profession. Its development has ever
since been in the direction of increasing
the opportunity for the study in as
tronomy in all its branches, until now
it- is recognized that the University of
California, with its astronomical de
partments, the Lick "and the Berkeley,
has the best organized training school
for the profession of astronomy.

Several of the larger and more influ

The recent difficulty between the
:?tate Board of Harbor Commissioners
and commission merchants who were
charged with violating the Woodward
law has hoon productive of trouble in
the cami' of the Wholesale Fruit and
Produce Merchants' Protective Associa
tion. The trouble originated when the
executive committee of the association
decided to levy an assessment of $10 on
all inemljors for the purpose of defray
ing th^ exMcnse of the litigation now
betes carried on In the courts against
the Harbor Commissioners, and it has
leached such proportions as to threaten
to disrupt the organization.
On December 3 the permits to sell
perishable produce on the State
wharves which had previously been is
sued to Wolf & Sons. Wetmore Broth
ers, McDonough & llunyon and L. Sea
tona. & Co. were revoked by the board
<Â«n the ground that the holders of the
permits were violating the Woodward
law. These firms immediately secured
the cervices of Attorney J. B. Reinstein
and proceeded to fight the matter in
i ho courts. The association was then
tailed upon to defray* the expenses of
the litigation by the merchants in
volved, who claimed that they as rep
resentative fin::s of the commission
lousiness were acting in the interests of
all commission merchants who are
members of the association, and not for
personal reasons alone.
The executive committee met last
creek to consider the request and de

ated quite a stir on the street, particu
larly among small dealeis and jobbers
who do not transact business on the
wharves. The action of the committee
came in for much unfavorable com

ers claimed that they were being taxed

â¢ W. J. DEAN.
Seventy-four years old, alone in the
world, penniless and unable to obtain
employment â¢ at his trade as cariage
maker, Warren J. Dean, who lived for
the last twenty years in the Hancock
House, at 781 Mission street, ended his
life last Friday night by inhaling illu
minating gas through a rubber tube. The
body was found yesterday morning ly
ing in bed with one end of the tube in
his mouth. Several notes in pencil lay
on a table in the room. One of these
read as follows:
Harvey's condition is such that he
can throw' no light on the case. All
day he lay in a condition of semi-con
sciousness, rousing but once long
enough to give his name and address.
To Questions addressed him he gave
Incoherent answers, at various times
answering similar interrogatories both
in the affirmative and the negative.
Dr. Lisner, who is attending the case,
admits that he is very much puzzled.
He diagnosed it as coma resulting from
a diseased condition of the kidneys,
bowels and heart. So far as Dr. Lianer
could . ascertain, the man has at no
time showed symptoms of poisoning by
strychnine. As a precaution Dr. Llsner
removed the contents of" the patient's
stomach and sent them to the city
chemist for analysis. A superficial ex
amination of the contents showed that
Harvey had not been drinking, but that
his stomach was not properly perform
ing its functions, as the food partaken
of Friday night was but partly digest
ed. Harvey's employers and -fellow
workmen say he was not to
the use of licuor. but was subject to
epileptic fits. He Is apparently about
63 years of age.
Keller, the dead man, waa a native
of Germany, about 43 years of age. The
police say he was an ex-convict and
served seven years for burglary under
the name of Schmidt. â¢ .
The dead- man was not known to
have any enemies around the camp
that might wish to injure him and the
poison could hardly have been admin
istered in the food, as none of the other
employes showed any symptoms of ill
ness during the day. The workmen em
ployed at the camp are not permitted
to take any liquor on the premises and
none is sold there. So far as can be
learned Keller was sober when last seen
alive. A careful search of the prem
ises was made by the Coroner's depu
ties, but no poison could be found in
the shanty inhabited by the men.
HARVEY SEMI-CONSCIOUS.
. This theory would fit the case very
nicely were it not for the discovery
made by Dr. Bacigalupi at the Morgue.
When .Dr. Bacigalupi performed the
autopsy on the body of the dead man
he found the vital organs in a normal
condition, aside from the fact that they
showed indications that. the man had
been a heavy drinker. None of them
were so badly diseased as tir cause
death; In fact, no immediate cause of
death could be ascertained.
Dr. Bacigalupi gives it as his opinion
that the man's death was caused by
some poison, presumably strychnine.
The contents of the stomach were re
moved and with other portions of the
body sent to the city chemist for analy
sis. "". V â¢"â¢Â¦
Other developments in the case,. how
ever, indicate that at least one of the
men met with foul play or else de
liberately ended his life. Harvey and
Keller occupied one of the little shan
ties or bunk houses connected with the
company's plant at Huntera Point.
Friday night they dined with the other
employer of the concern, about thirty
in number, at the common mess table.
Yesterday morning H. Conway, a
watchman, while making his rounds
found Keller lying dead en the lioor
and Harvey unconscious by his side.
Both were, dressed in their underclothes
and had apparently been preparing to
go to bed for the night, when they
were suddenly stricken. The body of
the dead man was taken to the Morgue
and Harvey was removed to the City
and County Hospital.
The police were at once notified and
Immediately began theorizing on nat
ural causes and built up a strong case
to support their theory. They learned
that Keller had been treated at the
City and County Hospital about a week
ago for alcoholism and heart disease.
Harvey, his roommate, is an epileptic.
According to the theory evolved by
the police. Keller was again stricken
with delirium tremens and Harvey be
came so frightened that he fell into
an epileptic fit.
BACIGALUPI SAYS POISON.
Mystery surrounds the sudden death
of Charles Keller and the peculiar ill
ness of ' James Harvey, laborers em
ployed by the Alaska Codfish Company
at the drying plant at Hunters Point.
The police incline to the theory that
Keller's death waa due to natural
causes and that Harvey's illness is oc
casioned by a malady from which he
has lone suffered.
The board stopped the contractors for
the Red Men's Hall, now building on
Golden Gate avenue and Leavenworth
street, from obstructing the street with
loads of lumber. The contractors were
compelled to secure storage room on a
nearby vacant lot.
The board laid off Edward Keagan, a
janitor.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
rescinded its former action in raising
the pay of painters in its employ from
$3 50 to 54 per diem, with the privilege
of a half-holiday on Saturdays with loss
of pay for the half-day. A committee
consisting of L. R. Boynton and T. C
Butterworth from the Affiliated Build
ing Contractors appeared before the
board and stated that its action would
cause trouble, as the standard wages
paid to painters under the rules of the
Building Trades Council was 53 50 a
day. The committee said that the fact
that the board had raised the pay
would necessitate the general raising
of the wages.
After putting the wages of its paint
ers back to the original figure of $3 50
per day, the board postponed further
consideration on the petition of its
painters for an increase until such time
as the agreement of the Master Paint
ers' Association and painters establish-,
ing wages at $4 per day shall go into
effect, probably on March 1.
The board denied the petition of P.
Labordue to lay sidewalks on Park Lane
street, between Second and Third.
The report will be transmitted to the
Board of Supervisors at its meeting to
morrow for the purpose of enabling it
to establish a basis of valuation of the
properties and upon -which it may fix
and determine water rates to be
charged the city and county and its in
habitants for the year commencing
July 1, 1904, and ending June 30. 1905.
In making the appraisement the
Board of Public Works submits a list
of all lands, water rights, reservoir
sites and tangible property of all kinds
belonging to the company, together
with a specific statement of valuation in
each instance.
City Engineer Grunsky yesterday
filed with the Board of Public Works
an appraisement of the properties of
the Spring Valley Water Company
actually, used in furnishing: the city
and county of San Francisco and the
inhabitants thereof with a pure and
wholesome supply of water. The report
fixes the valuation of the company's
plant at about $25,000,000. exclusive of
an appraisement of $1,400,000 for estab
lished business which the Supervisors
eliminated in fixing last year's water
rates.

The fifty deputy clerks employed in
the office of County Clerk John J.
Greif made their first monthly report
yesterday. It is a creditable one, in
that it shows that though Greif has
been in office 'less than a month he
has caught- up a- month on the work
that ran behind in the time of his
predecessor, A. B. Mahony, and has
also kept the current work up to date.
This showing-is due to the fact that
Greif, instead of making v the men
work overtime, simply required j t-- **
they should report- for work promptly,
at 8:30 every morning and work until
5 p. m. and.that all courtroom- clerks
and Mothers whose time was not fully
occupied -between those hours should
put in their spare time in' working on
the books of the probate department.
One of the innovations in the of
fice is a time book, in which all clerks
are. required to place their signatures
promptly at S: 30 a. m. and at 5 p.-m.
the time jof reporting, off. From this
book the time of each clerk is made
up- and entered in the regular time
book-by.the chief deputy each day. ,

BERKELEY, Jan. 3Q.â Four new in
struments and two new buildings were
dedicated to the uses of the students of
the University of California this even
ing at the students' observatory. The
meeting of the Astronomical Society of
the Pacific was made the occasion for
this important ceremony, in which par
ticipated men whose lives are devoted
to the study of the heavens and men
who study them simply because they
like to dabble with the infinite and
mysterious.
The dedicated instruments represent
gifts of friends of the university and
purchases. "William M. Pierson of San
Francisco presented the eight-inch re
fractor, now the most valuable instru
ment at the observatory. Tlje five-inch
refractor, formerly the property of the
late Senator Fair, is the gift of his
daughter, Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs. The
photographic telescope represents the
work of Dr. A. F. Gillihan, a practicing
physician in Berkeley, as designer, and
Valdermar Arntzen as builder, the en
tire instrument except the lens having
been made in Berkeley. The Repsold
measuring machine was purchased for
5850 in Germany.
The buildings that cover these instru
ments are plain but substantial struc
tures. The Pierson refractor occupies a
small building of its own, while the
other three instruments are contained
in a larger structure, having two domes
and two large rooms. Instruments and
buildings are estimated to have cost
510,000. This sum includes the remodel
ing of the old observatory.
HISTORY OF OBSERVATORY.
The exercises this evening were held
in the astronomical lecture room. Otto
von Goldern, president of the Astro
nomical Society, presided, i Brief ad
dresses were made by President Wheel
er and Professor W. W. Campbell, di
rector of the Lick Observatory. They
were followed by Dr. A. O. Leuschner,
director of the students' observatory,
--. "It was through' the- efforts: of Pro
fessorSoule, head of the department of
engineering, assisted by Professor
Welcker, that an, appropriation of $10,
000 for the erection of a students' ob
servatory was secured from the Legis
lature In, 1887. '. It impressed me when: I
first visitedÂ«it in 1889 as a perfect model
of -the Lick Observatory. It was com
plete in its â¢ details and 1 just what it
ought to be. â¢* ..
"In those earlier days the headquar
ters of the. department of civil en
gineering and> astronomy, ' of which the
students' observatory formed the other
part, consisted of one room on the top
floor of? North Hall. .The head. of the
department and one instructor made up
the staff. Not long afterward the bur
den , of instruction in civil engineering
became so great that : Professor Soule
was- forced to ask to be relieved of the
latter, and in 1892 the courses in gen
eral and practical astronomy were as
signed to me, while I still retained my
connection with the department of
mathematics." : , â¢ ,
Professor . Leuschner's address was
followed , by others â¢ speaking on topics
familiar to them. . Dr. R. T. Crawford
spoke upon ' "The Constant of Refrac
tion," Dr. B.'L. Newkirk upon "The
Watson Asteroids" and Dr., Gillihan

Several of the larger and more influ

subject stated that no such action as
that contemplated by the small dealers
would be taken, and it was pointed out
'.hat the by-laws .of the association con

which would justify the action of the

The recent difficulty between the
:?tate Board of Harbor Commissioners
and commission merchants who were
charged with violating the Woodward
law has hoon productive of trouble in
the cami' of the Wholesale Fruit and
Produce Merchants' Protective Associa
tion. The trouble originated when the
executive committee of the association
decided to levy an assessment of $10 on
all inemljors for the purpose of defray
ing th^ exMcnse of the litigation now
betes carried on In the courts against
the Harbor Commissioners, and it has
leached such proportions as to threaten
to disrupt the organization.
On December 3 the permits to sell
perishable produce on the State
wharves which had previously been is
sued to Wolf & Sons. Wetmore Broth
ers, McDonough & llunyon and L. Sea
tona. & Co. were revoked by the board
<Â«n the ground that the holders of the
permits were violating the Woodward
law. These firms immediately secured
the cervices of Attorney J. B. Reinstein
and proceeded to fight the matter in
i ho courts. The association was then
tailed upon to defray* the expenses of
the litigation by the merchants in
volved, who claimed that they as rep
resentative fin::s of the commission

all commission merchants who are
members of the association, and not for
personal reasons alone.
The executive committee met last

ated quite a stir on the street, particu
larly among small dealeis and jobbers
who do not transact business on the

came in for much unfavorable com

â¢ W. J. DEAN.
Seventy-four years old, alone in the
world, penniless and unable to obtain
employment â¢ at his trade as cariage
maker, Warren J. Dean, who lived for
the last twenty years in the Hancock
House, at 781 Mission street, ended his
life last Friday night by inhaling illu
minating gas through a rubber tube. The
body was found yesterday morning ly
ing in bed with one end of the tube in
his mouth. Several notes in pencil lay
on a table in the room. One of these
read as follows:
Harvey's condition is such that he
can throw' no light on the case. All
day he lay in a condition of semi-con
sciousness, rousing but once long
enough to give his name and address.
To Questions addressed him he gave
Incoherent answers, at various times
answering similar interrogatories both
in the affirmative and the negative.
Dr. Lisner, who is attending the case,
admits that he is very much puzzled.
He diagnosed it as coma resulting from
a diseased condition of the kidneys,
bowels and heart. So far as Dr. Lianer
could . ascertain, the man has at no
time showed symptoms of poisoning by
strychnine. As a precaution Dr. Llsner
removed the contents of" the patient's
stomach and sent them to the city
chemist for analysis. A superficial ex
amination of the contents showed that
Harvey had not been drinking, but that
his stomach was not properly perform
ing its functions, as the food partaken
of Friday night was but partly digest
ed. Harvey's employers and -fellow
workmen say he was not to
the use of licuor. but was subject to
epileptic fits. He Is apparently about
63 years of age.
Keller, the dead man, waa a native
of Germany, about 43 years of age. The
police say he was an ex-convict and
served seven years for burglary under
the name of Schmidt. â¢ .
The dead- man was not known to
have any enemies around the camp
that might wish to injure him and the
poison could hardly have been admin
istered in the food, as none of the other
employes showed any symptoms of ill
ness during the day. The workmen em
ployed at the camp are not permitted
to take any liquor on the premises and
none is sold there. So far as can be
learned Keller was sober when last seen
alive. A careful search of the prem
ises was made by the Coroner's depu
ties, but no poison could be found in
the shanty inhabited by the men.
HARVEY SEMI-CONSCIOUS.
. This theory would fit the case very
nicely were it not for the discovery
made by Dr. Bacigalupi at the Morgue.
When .Dr. Bacigalupi performed the
autopsy on the body of the dead man
he found the vital organs in a normal
condition, aside from the fact that they
showed indications that. the man had
been a heavy drinker. None of them
were so badly diseased as tir cause
death; In fact, no immediate cause of
death could be ascertained.
Dr. Bacigalupi gives it as his opinion
that the man's death was caused by
some poison, presumably strychnine.
The contents of the stomach were re
moved and with other portions of the
body sent to the city chemist for analy
sis. "". V â¢"â¢Â¦
Other developments in the case,. how
ever, indicate that at least one of the
men met with foul play or else de
liberately ended his life. Harvey and
Keller occupied one of the little shan
ties or bunk houses connected with the
company's plant at Huntera Point.
Friday night they dined with the other
employer of the concern, about thirty
in number, at the common mess table.
Yesterday morning H. Conway, a
watchman, while making his rounds
found Keller lying dead en the lioor
and Harvey unconscious by his side.
Both were, dressed in their underclothes
and had apparently been preparing to
go to bed for the night, when they
were suddenly stricken. The body of
the dead man was taken to the Morgue
and Harvey was removed to the City
and County Hospital.
The police were at once notified and
Immediately began theorizing on nat
ural causes and built up a strong case
to support their theory. They learned
that Keller had been treated at the
City and County Hospital about a week
ago for alcoholism and heart disease.
Harvey, his roommate, is an epileptic.
According to the theory evolved by
the police. Keller was again stricken
with delirium tremens and Harvey be
came so frightened that he fell into
an epileptic fit.
BACIGALUPI SAYS POISON.
Mystery surrounds the sudden death
of Charles Keller and the peculiar ill
ness of ' James Harvey, laborers em
ployed by the Alaska Codfish Company
at the drying plant at Hunters Point.
The police incline to the theory that
Keller's death waa due to natural
causes and that Harvey's illness is oc
casioned by a malady from which he
has lone suffered.
The board stopped the contractors for
the Red Men's Hall, now building on
Golden Gate avenue and Leavenworth
street, from obstructing the street with
loads of lumber. The contractors were
compelled to secure storage room on a
nearby vacant lot.
The board laid off Edward Keagan, a
janitor.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
rescinded its former action in raising
the pay of painters in its employ from
$3 50 to 54 per diem, with the privilege
of a half-holiday on Saturdays with loss
of pay for the half-day. A committee
consisting of L. R. Boynton and T. C
Butterworth from the Affiliated Build
ing Contractors appeared before the
board and stated that its action would
cause trouble, as the standard wages
paid to painters under the rules of the
Building Trades Council was 53 50 a
day. The committee said that the fact
that the board had raised the pay
would necessitate the general raising
of the wages.
After putting the wages of its paint
ers back to the original figure of $3 50
per day, the board postponed further
consideration on the petition of its
painters for an increase until such time
as the agreement of the Master Paint
ers' Association and painters establish-,
ing wages at $4 per day shall go into
effect, probably on March 1.
The board denied the petition of P.
Labordue to lay sidewalks on Park Lane
street, between Second and Third.
The report will be transmitted to the
Board of Supervisors at its meeting to
morrow for the purpose of enabling it
to establish a basis of valuation of the
properties and upon -which it may fix
and determine water rates to be
charged the city and county and its in
habitants for the year commencing
July 1, 1904, and ending June 30. 1905.
In making the appraisement the
Board of Public Works submits a list
of all lands, water rights, reservoir
sites and tangible property of all kinds
belonging to the company, together
with a specific statement of valuation in
each instance.
City Engineer Grunsky yesterday
filed with the Board of Public Works
an appraisement of the properties of
the Spring Valley Water Company
actually, used in furnishing: the city
and county of San Francisco and the
inhabitants thereof with a pure and
wholesome supply of water. The report
fixes the valuation of the company's
plant at about $25,000,000. exclusive of
an appraisement of $1,400,000 for estab
lished business which the Supervisors
eliminated in fixing last year's water
rates.

Uncle Hank Harris made known to
the world yesterday that his ball team
that will represent San Francisco- dur
ing the season of 1904 is complete. If
nobody jumps it will line up in thÂ» first
battle the way Uncle gives it out. Ju-'
how good a ball team Hank has under
his wing will be known as soon as. The
fans see It in action. Till then we will
have to take Uncle's word for it that
his tossers are the swellest bunch that
ever came down Eighth street.
The team complete is as follows:
Pitchersâ Bert Jones, James Whalen
Win Cutter, Stanley Yerkes; catchers.
Tom Leahy and Hans Hanson; first
base, William Massey; second base, An
drew Anderson; third base. Charles Ir
win; shortstop, J. C. Gouchnauer; out
fieldersâPat Meany, E. J. Waldron, Jo
seph Marshall; utility man, Bert Del
mas.
The team on paper looks pretty good,
and Uncle says it will perform better
than it\ louks. There are many of the
old familiar faces among those who
will labor for Hank, and. also many
new ones who will have to be Intro
duced to the San Francisco ,fans.
For instance, Bert Jones, one of the
two new slab artists, Is a south paw
and played last year with the Colo
rado Springs team of the Western
League. He has a good reputation as
a high grade pitcher and is known to
line *em out to the fence at times when
hitfl'are needed. Yerkes, the other
curvs'ter, is an ex-National Leaguer,
having played with St. Louis for some
time. He is a six-foot kid and has
some speed. \
Bill Masaey, the new first baseman,
played with Toronto in the- Eastern
league last year. He has. the reputa
tion of being able to clout the ball a
city block, and his average last - year
was.328.for the season. Andy Ander
son, the guardian of the second sack,
played with Portland last year and
everybody knows him. - '
Gouchnauer. the man who will take
Danny Shay's place, is one of the fast
est shortstops in the business,
but Â«he can't hit. He was a
Btaf-wlth the =â¢ Cleveland Ameri-.
can League for two years and was al
ways a favorite with the fans. If; he
is stiJl as fast as - he waa two years
ago he will easily fliythe place left va
cant by Shay.
Two: new faces will be seen in the
outfield, those of .Waldron and Mar
shall. -Waldron isa left handed hitter
and always hits around the ; .300 , mark.
He wore a Kansas City suit last year
arid in 1902 chased flies for the Washr!
ington Senators in the American
League. Marshall played with " San
Francisco of Â¦ the : -, Pacific 1\ National
League last year and finished the ' sea*
son with Pittsburg. He is Â¦ known; to
all the fans here.
Irwin will capt^n the team again
. Eddie Hanlon and Kid Broad were
about town yesterday spry and chipper
after their hour of fast boxing the
previous night. . Both bCys made good
wages. The receipts totalled $3600. Of
this the *club received one-half, while
Hanlon took $1170 and Broad $630.
' Hanlon, accompanied by his brother
and by Billy Delaney and Harry Foley.
will leave for 'the East to-morrow
morning. Both Hanlon and Foley ex
pect to secure a number of bouts while
away. They have also been offered sev
eral theatrical engagements. They will
remain East as long as there is any
thing to keep them busy.
Hanlon learned a number of practl-.
cal Iessops on Friday night. He found
that he has developed into a full
fledged lightweight and that 133 pounds,
at which he entered the ring, is his
best notch. He also found that an ex
perienced second like Billy Delaney is
of tremendous advantage, both before
and during a fight. In hiÂ» previous
fights he has been seriously handi
capped in having inexperienced ad
visers. Â¦ â¢ . Â¦
The leeson which should prove of
great value to him is that heretofore
he has been wofully overtrained. 'As
he leads a careful life he does not need
the amount of work a less temperate
boxer; would require. If Hanlon" is
shrewd in his matchmaking he should
return from the East undefeated, and
it will then take a 'great man to lower
his colors.

Pilots Three Winners Under the
Wire and Cleverly Outrides
Bedfern. on Two Occasions
There is a strong Southern flavor
about the name Miss Betty, and it was
fit that she should rule favorite for
"the Oaks," decided 5-esterday at Oak
land race course.
Unfortunate!?, Garnet Ferguson's
filly finished third instead of first for
the valuable prize, worth $2340 to the
winner. The race always i\as a good
drawing card and 5000 people saw the
ton stylishly bred misses parade on
their way to the post. Â»It was not a
really high-class field, but it was an
evenly matched one, making specula
tion all the more rife. Workouts ap
peared to cut a strong figure, as a mile
and a furlong was farther than any of
the fillies had previously been asked to
Miss Betty, with Jack Martin up, had
-the call at S to 5. with Dungannon, Red
Cross and Cap and Gown next in
demand. The latter, owned by Dr.
Rowcil, was new to the public, but as
she had covered the journey in a work
out in a manner that pleased the crit
ics, came in for steady support.
JGUXSY I/ALTS CLEVER RIDE.
- Cap and Gown was returned the win
ner. aÂ«d to Johnny Daly is due much
'of the credit for her victory. Daly
waited behind the pacemakers. Silent
T .Vater, Red Cross Nurse and Anirad, to
the turn for the stand, and then, tak
ing the lead, with his mount, led Ani
rad out a length at the wire in 1:55.
Miss Berty either sulked or was
slightly bothered at the far turn, drop
ring back a length or two. She closed
strongly though through the stretch,
taking the show from Dunga-nnon.
As six favorites were toppled over,
the bookies had much the better of
the argument. The sport was exeel-
Jent. if the favorites did not score,
and thr different winners were cora
jflled to run fast. Horatius, a 16 to 1
outsider, won the handicap, equaling
the coast record for one and a six
teenth miles. In the concluding
ownt Goldrn Light, another rank out
fcider, lowered the coast record for one
mile and fifty yards to 1:42%.
Sea Air, the mount of .Tommy
Burns, was installed favorite for the
two-yoar-old scramble at half a mile.
The* lHly rar a.u excellent race, but
could iiot overhaul Arisbe, ridden by
r-uHniaii. which jumped away in the
lead and was never headed. Bill
Short stayed with the winner for three
;md a half furlongs, and, then tiring,
finished third.
LUSTIO IX>SES BY A HEAD.
Although Kleinwood is a "mudder,"
the oolt had shown good form of late
i&cd was made favorite for the open
5iiji event. I!e was pocketed the first
part of it and finished third. Lustigr,
an I (o 1 shot, made all the running,
â¢sr.ly to be beaten out a head at the
v ire by George Berry, a 5 to 1 chance,
Mith Foley up.
The faint-hearted Glendenning. an
t> to 5 choice, furnished the disap
pointment in the Futurity course run
following. He took the lead from
Narra G ' n the far turn, and, entering
stretch, jooked a winner. As the
"-wire was approached Larsen found the
first choice faltering under him, and
ro .'imount or persuasion could make
nim last. Narra G, the runner-up
was also v.tary. and St. Winnifridc,
riddon by Oliphant, won by two
lengths with the utmost ease. Cllan
dennlng ran third. Bay Wonder mijht
lÂ»ave be<?n a contender with a more
experienced lider up.
Only five started in the mile and a
sixteenth handicap, and Horatius, at 16
to 1, surprised his own stable folks by
galloping in ahead of Joe" Lesser in
coast record time for the distance,
I:IS)(. With Soothsayer out of the way
the smart ones figured it out ajj, easy
spot for the three-year-old Mendon,
v.hich went to the post an 8 to 5 fa
vorite.
HORATIUS AX EASY WINNER.
The latter cut out the running for
seven-eighths of a mile, with Horatius
as a side nartner. Kunz then let thÂ«
latter down, and assuming the front
position he heat Joe Lesser like break
ing stickF. Mendon was kept busy beat
ing out Stilicho for the show.
Owner Charley McCafferty's Golden
Litfht. which finished third to Scotsman
and Mimo on the preceding day,
showed vastly improved form by cap
turing the last number, a mile and fifty
yards selling affair, with 10 to 1 about
him in the ring. In a bumping affray
at the ftart Kunz was thrown from
Somenop, and the riderless horse led
the field a length or two the entire
route. The Fretter led for two-thirds
of the journey, when Goldeh Light
closed strongly on the outside under
Foley's urging, downing the favorite,
Heather Honey, a length in l:42?i.
NOTES OF THE THACK-
Dr. Rowell purchased Cap and
Gown at St. Louis.
Twenty-five boots cut In. Among
the new men on the block was the
familiar flgrure of Riley Grannan.
Charley Henshall was reported to

Owing to. the closeness .of the- vote
McMenomy took the matter into, the
courts and made the point that suf
ficient of Ruch's votes were invalidat
ed by the stamping of ballots where
there were "no nominations" to re
verse the result. He .was given a de
cision in the Superior Court, but
Ruch, who had taken his seat, imme
diately appealed the case, which acted
as a stay on the decision of the lower
court, and In the meantime served out
hls-term.
It Is an empty victory McMenomy
won, although the Supreme Court
states he is entitled to the salary. The
pay of a Councilman is S40 a month
and he will probably have an action
against Ruch for two years' back pay.
To-day, a year after . the " expiration
of the term of Andrew J. Ruch as
Councilman from the First Ward, the
Supreme Court handed - down a de
cision that Captain, J. H. McMenomy.
his opponent, should have been
seated. The election took place three
years ago and only about fifty votes
separated the two men when the final
count was made. S McMenomy was the
Republican candidate, while Ruch
was the nominee on tKe Municipal
League ticket.

SOME OP THE GOWNS.
At the wedding to-day Mrs. A. A.
Moore was attired In a 'black satin
gown with point lace collar. The
groom's mother, Mrs. J. J. Valentine,
wore a very handsome gown of white
cloth and lace, with a white hat. Mrs.
A. A. Moore Jr. was a, conspicuous
figure in a soft white , brocade, over
.which she wore a long pale blue sat
in cjoth coat Her hat was white lace.
Mr. and Mrs. Valentine have gone
to Portland and will divide their time
between that city and Spokane for the
next year, when they will probably re
turn to Oakland.
The marriage that took place In
the little East Oakland church to-day
Joined two of the most widely known
families In the State â those of A. A.
Moore, the prominent San Francisco
attorney, and the. late John J; Valen
tine, .president of Wells, Fargo &
Co.
The church ceremony was followed
by a small reception at the home of
the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. A.
A. Moore. Only relatives and the
ycung couple's Intimate friends In
the younger set were guests at the
house.
The ushers were Edwin Hume,
Stanley Moore. James Kenna, Fred
Dleckmann. Arthur Goodfellow, Philip
Clay and Whipple Hall.
The bride was escorted to the altar
by her father, and her friends could
not suppress a murmur of admiration
as their eyes fell on her exquisite
gown of white. satin moussellne and
duchesse lace. The train was quite
long and fell- In graceful folds from a
shirred yoke. Duchesse, lace formed
the yoke and collar. The veilâ an
heirloom of rare point lace â was not
worn over the brlde!s face, but was
fastened to the high coiffure and
swept, In cobwebby folds, almost to
the hem of the long train. The bride
carried a great armful of Easter lilies.
The groom and his best man, Hugh
Goodfellow, awaited the bride's com
ing at the altar. Bishop Nichols of
ficiated In the solemn ritual of the
Episcopal church and- was assisted by
Rev. William Carson Shaw.
Miss Ethel Moore, who attended her
sister as maid of honor, | looked ex
tremely well in a beautiful gown' of
white point d'esprlt over violet silk.
A lavish garniture of point. lace was
appliqued to both skirt and bodice,
the deep yoke and collar being of the
lace. Her hat was of white tulle and
sweeping plumes and the general ef
fect was more white than violet. '
_. BRIDE IS ADMIRED.
If one may believe the old adage.
"Happy will be the bride the sun
shines on," then indeed Is future glad
ness . assured for Jacqueline Moore
that tvas â now Mrs. John J. Valentine.
The sun was full generous with his
golden rays as if to shower more
blessings on these young people and
everything conspired to make their
wedding to-day one of the prettiest af
fairs ever seen In this city.
Long before 3 o'clock, the hour set
for the ceremony, the little Church of
the Advent in East Oakland was
crowded with guests and seldom has
so brilliant an assemblage gathered
within its walls. The decorations were
simple in character, but extremely
artistic. A delicate tracery of foliage
hid the wall back of the altar and
great plumes of the date palm fell
gracefully from the pillars all about
the church. At the end of each pew
on the central aisle was tied a. bunch
of lacy foliage and spring blossoms.
With characteristic independence "in
planning, for her. wedding, Miss Moore
decided against the traditional - pink
and green and white in vogue and
adopted- vlqlet as the color to be used
by the bridal party. The result to-day
was flattering to her judgment, for
nothing could have been daintier -or
more effective.
Preceded by the ushers, Miss Marian
Goodfellow, as first bridesmaid, led the
way. Like the six other young ladies
thatÂ» formed the bride's vanguard, she
wore an exquisite gown of pale violet
chiffon cloth, the shimmering folds of
the shirred and Â« ruffled skirt being
dotted with medallions of point lace.
The soft, wide collar falling from the
lace yoke and the long "angel" sleeves
gave an exceedingly graceful effect.
The hat of violet tulle, with long,
drooping white plume and a shower of
white carnations completed a bewlld
eringly beautiful costume. Each of
.the six bridesmaids, Miss Marian
Smith, Miss Florence White, Miss Isa
belle Hooper, Miss Anita Oliver, Miss
Ethel Valentine and Miss Edna Barry,
wore a costume similar to that of Miss
Goodfellow.

When the marriage finally took place
ihe mother, unbroken in spirit, refused
to attend. The ceremony was per
formed by the P.ev. George Dodson in
the Unitarian Church, and the Bowen
family attended. The Darneals did not.
Young Bowen was given a position as
representative cf his father's firm In
New York, but afterward moved to Co
lumbus. Ohio. Here. Mrs. Bowen says,
her husband ceased to care for her and
finally to provide for her necessities,
tujd che was forced to return to her
home, which resulted in her bringing
the suit which to-day save her back
her freedom.
The marriage or the pair was per
formed under the most adverse circum
stances. Susie Darneal w.as one of the
rreu'.est girts In Alameda's exclusive
F8t. Her mother, Mrs. Hervey Darneal.
Is a member of the organization of the
Colonial Dames and has the blood of
five of the early Governors of America
flowing through her veins. She was
ambitious for her daughter, and when
discovered the attachment between
her and Alan Bowen she vowed the
marriage should not take place.
As the son of one of the founders of
the firm of Wetmore, Bowen & Co.,
young Alan had been given all the ad
vantages that money could buy. He
was a member of the Olympic Club in
Fan Francisco and played football on
the Reliance team. But he was not up
to the Etandard In pedigree set by the
mother, who rrided herself on her an
cestry.
There was no opposition to the gTant-
Jr.s of the decree, and the young hus
band It Is said is at present in Colum
bus. Ohio. Mrs. Bowen is back once
more at her o'.d home, living with her
rerents on Grand street. In Alameda.
The romance cf Susie Darneal and
Alan Bowen, who were married la Ala
meda three yÂ«ars ago. ended dismally
In the divorce court here to-day, when
Judge Melvln granted her a divorce on
the grounds of willful neglect and fail
ure to provide. She was also allowed to
resume her maiden name.

One of the prettiest weddings, of the
season was the Drown-Boardmati wed
ding yesterday at St. Luke's. The chan
cel < was aglow with candles,.and.wbod
wardia and its lesser sisters of the forest
were gathered there *in profusion. ; St.
Joseph lilies completed" a beautiful
picture, saving perhaps the gladsome
gleam that poured through the stained
window over the altar..
At 11:30 o'clock the church was filled
with guests, the women for the most
part stunningly gowned. At noon, when
the solemn strains of the wedding
march from "Lohengrin" floated from
the organ the back of the church was
crowded. Now, for the everlasting credit
of St. Luke's, be it said there was but
little immoderate pr vulgar craning of
necks â just a normal and polite inter
est in one of the prettiest bridal parties
of the year.
The ushers led the way, followed by
the maid of honor. Mias-Newell Drown,
in a white crepe de chine frock, with a
dashing hat of lilies of the valley. Her
bouquet was of the same exquisite
flowers. /
The bridesmaids, Miss Charlotte El
linwood, Miss Linda Cadwalader, Miss
Stella Kane and Miss Susan Blanding,
made a charming group in white crepe
de chine gowns, with white hats
trimmed with' emerald taffeta and
white tips. They carried dainty' white
chiffon muffs trimmed with white car
nations. It was distinctly a white- and
green wedding â white for eternity and
green for constancy. Pretty symbolism,
wasn't it?
Then came the lovely bride, on the
arm of her father, A. N. Drown. She
was gowned exquisitely In white chiffon
satin, with a tulle veil held in place by
a coronet of orchids. She carried a
large bouquet of the same blossoms.
The ceremony was performed by
Bishop Nichols, assisted by Rev. B. M.
Weeden, rector of St. Luke's.
After the ceremony about 200 guests
drove to the home of the bride on Jack
son street, where a reception was held,

her strength is fading 1 away and she has
no hopes of ever being 1 restored. . | Such
was my feeling a few months ago when'
I was advised that my poor health was
caused by prolapsus or falling 1 of the
womb. The words 'sounded- like &
knell to me, I felt that my sun had set ;
but I/ydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound" came to me' as an'
elixir of life ; it restored the lost forces
and built me up until my good health
returned to me. J For four months I
took the medicine daily, and each dose
added health â¢ and ~ strength. I am so :

The latter were on "scratch," while
their opponents were "3-6" back of
scratch. Miss . Ratcliffe and Hardy
were favorites and when they won
the first set 6-3 it seemed they would
have but little trouble winning. In
the second and third sets Miss Hotch
kiss and Allen played a strong- game
and won out after a hard, close
struggle. Miss Hotchkiss played a
much better game than the* young
lady opposing and the credit of their
victory belongs fully as much to her
as to Allen. Miss Hotchkiss showed
she is the strongest girl player in this
part of the State. The* score of this
match was 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

of them requiring three seta to settle
the question of supremacy. In the
finals Miss Hotchkiss and Allen al
lowed odds of "owe 2-6" to Miss Mary
Ttatcliffe of Berkeley and Frank
Stringham of San Francisco. The
losers played a fine game at the start
and won the first set easily. On the
next two sets Miss Hotchkiss and Al

Stringham weakened. The score was
2-6. 6-1; 6-2.

About eix months ago Williams ap
peared at Santa Clara and obtained
work In the Pacific Improvement Mill
at that place. Mrs. Josephine Meyers,
the mother of his sweetheart, conducts
a boarding-house, and Williams went
to board with her. The two young peo
ple at once became lovers, and last
September Williams eloped with his
landlady's daughter. Miss Meyers was
not quite 18 years old and her mother
objected to the marriage. In eloping
Meyers forgot to pay his board bill, and
Mrs. Meyers at once swore out a. war
rant charging him with beating her
out of $27. The young couple was. lo
cated in San ( Francisco and brought
back to Santa Clara. Mrs. Meyers took
her daughter home and Williams was
convicted and sentenced to six months
in the County Jail by Justice Herring
ton.
This only Increased the girl's ardor
for her lover, and she called regularly
at the jail to see him. She finally won
her mother over, and of late Mrs. Mey
ers has been urging the marriage. Wil
liams is only 19 years old, and in order
for him to marry he must have a
guardian. Attorney W. M. Beggs was
interested in the case, and he found
that Williams, who had been an orphan
for many years, was entitled to $185
pension as the son of a pensioner that
had never been collected. This money
has now been secured from the Gov
ernment. Governor Pardee was also
importuned to pardon Williams, as the
sentence was deemed a severe one, and
he consented on the condition that the
young people get married. As soon as
the marriage is performed the pardon,
which has been prepared, will be hand
ed Williams.
A marriage license for the young peo
ple was procured to-day and the wed
ding was to have taken place. Father
Raggio of Santa Clara, who is to per
form the ceremony, could not be pres
ent, however, and the marriage has
been postponed until Monday morning.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 30.â The Governor's
blessing in the form of. a pardon awaits
Walter H. Williams, a prisoner in the
County Jail, as soon as he weds Jose
phine A. Meyers, a comely miss of San
ta Clara. "Williams is serving a six
month sentence for beating his fiancee's
mother out of a board bill, and in the
regular course of things would not be
discharged from the Jail until February
21, and then only at that time by the
allowance of thirty days for good be
havior. Besides not only being par
doned, he will have the snug little sum
of $185 of a back pension to start mar
ried life with. , ,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
â¢ During the past ten days fires \ of
mysterious origin have been of almost
nightly occurrence and the authorities
haw concluded that they are the sys
tematic work of incendiaries. Orders
have been Issued to patrolmen and
firemen to keep a close watch In the
hope of detecting the perpetrators.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 30. â Three
flres, two in the residence portion of
town near Westlake Park and another
at the Clede Hotel on West Sixth
street, nearly a mile and a half apart,
broke out at almost the same hour
this morning. It seems certain that
all were of incendiary origin. Only
one proved to be of a serious nature,
destroying two dwellings that had
Just been completed and as yet un
occupied, entailing: a loss of $5000.

Eglsto Canepo, who' lives at, 317 Union street
and Is employed at 44 .: Main ' street,' owes his
life to the textile weakness of the material of
which his working Jumper Is made. His left
sleeve was caught yesterday In " some ma
chinery at his place of employment. -. Had the
cloth been strong Canepo would have been
dragged Into a tangle of racing cranks and
whirling wheels and probably fatally mangled.
As It . turned out, however, he escaped with
a bruised arm, which was dressed at the Har
bor Hospital.

She Is not only making an extremely long

-'As a prize for pirates the Occidental
and. Oriental Steamship Company's
liner, Gaelic, Captain Finch, which ar
rived yesterday from the Orient, is
about the most desirable thing that
has crossed the Pacific in many days.
She carries a cargo of peculiar rich
ness and much of It in such form as
to have made it immediately available
for the pirate treasury. This precious
freight included 1,500,000 gold Chinese
yen and raw silk valued at $1,100,000.
This is the largest shipment of raw
silk that has -left an Oriental port in
more, than two years.
The Gaelic encountered northeast
and easterly gales for almost the en
tire passage and from Hongkong to
the Golden Gate her way led through
heavy head seas, which* contributed
considerable discomfort to the passen^
gers until they had acquired stable
stomachs and good, serviceable sea

CHICAGO. Jan. 30. â The less belligerent
news from the Orient was the main Influence
In the pit to-day. Small holders took
profits, causing declines of nearly a cent In
both the July and May deliveries. Some of the
loss was regained, but the close was weak
with May - K&Kc below last nlehfs final
figures. May corn closed %Â®>4c lower, but
oats were up %c. Provisions were 7Â»Â£ to 30c

The leading bull operator supported the
wheat market on break* early ln the day, and
there was also scattered buying from commis
sion-houses, but the demand was not so urgent
as it has been recently. In the face of ht'her

of moderate buying by the big bull interest,
prices began to Â«eek a lower level. May de

first half hour. Trading was of a dragging
character the greater part of the day. The
market exhibited . renewed eirrns of life at one

CASH WHEAT,
The Chicago wires of Bolton, de Ruyter &
Co. nald: "Market Is about' %c to %c lower.
It ' Is tho same hesitating. nervouB market as
for several divs past. Liverpool again showed
f8lr etrenKth on restricted shipments from Ar
gentina. The Eastern situation is also a.fac
tor. Operations in this market are only mod
crate and of a scalping nature.^ Armour sup
ports tho May. price on the soft'spots, and the
trade . |s disposed- to, think he -sells a little
through brokers on the hard spots. He Is
probably not changing the extent of his hold
ings materially. The visible supply may show
a small decrease ou Monday, but milling 'op
erations form such a largo percentage of the
demand that surprises are possible. Toledo
reported a good milling demand and there is
fair cash activity ln the Southwest. In present
conditions we think a irood scalping market Is
likely the best that may, be hoped." -.
There was no -change In this market. .The
demand for cash Wheat continued fair.
WHEATâ Foreign futures continued very
firm. " Â¦
Chicago continued unsettled, declining from
90%c to S9%c and recovering Â¦ to OOUc. There
was a good milling demand in the lake region

Â¦ Eggs closed the week very firm, with a sharp
demand for northern shipment by the steamer
whioh sails to-day. This demand was so urgent
that- tho shippers raid up to 25c Â¦ and took
anything they could get, ranch or store. The
trade were of the opinion, however, that the
shipping demand would fall off this week, as
Seattle reports the supply increasing' dally
there. The market was practically bare at the
close, with the commiflftion . merchants dis
posed to save their scanty holdings for their
regular city customers.

Bran and Middlings continue very firm, with

The Hay situation continues strong. Said. a
large dealer yesterday: "If the present stocks
of Hay were in: the hands, of the -farmers in
stead of the San Francisco dealers and large
country holders the market would be $2 50 per
ton higher and we would havq a $20 Hay mar
ket to-day." The same dealer reported Â«that
R.;P. Lathrop of the large Hay firm of Hol
llster r informs him that a surprising number
of orders are now being received from the Sa
linas Valley and . the southern counties and
that he is making daily shipments to the
south. : The prospects around Hollister are re
ported unfavorable .for- the growing crop, tho
mornings - being frosty and ." the days hot. . As
for the south, there will be no Hay there this
year unless the rains sot in snortly. But they
arc still , plowing in the dusty ground just tho
same, and if there is to be any crop In the
proposition this year they will get it.

Educational matters in the State of
New York do not seem to be running In
harmonious channels, according to a
statement made to a. citizen of San

INTERFERENCE
IS RESENTED
There seems to exist In the atmosphere of
our own university a very Ill-advised opinion
as to the competency of university heads to
(nark out a path to be trodden by secondary
cohorts and school authorities. This theory
crops out in the form of a department of so
called scientific pedagogy.
My experience of thirty years In the school
room inclines me to the belief that there Is
no such thing as a science of pedagogy. Science
may be â it should be used as an auxiliary- In
The fact that such a contest exists In the
State of ]few York^can be readily believed

Edlter of The Call: A recent letter ad
dressed tw the writer of this article ; from
Hon. Charles It tsklnner. Superintendent of
Public Instruction In the State of New York,
contains a clause that deserves more than, a
passing notice.': Tlie article Is as follows:
"Educational conditions, here arc in a fear
ful tangle owing- to the efforts off the regents
of the university to obtain controller the public
schools of tt<* State and to conduct them on

he must be mubject to, certain discipline: lie
must be taught to help himself; i. he must
get experience in handling the media by
which he can. help himself.'
â¢ Id all this the eecondary school forms- a

to be understood as criticising : the discipline
