WASHINGTON, June 30.â Devastating
storms in greater number, and more se
vere than have been known In the his
tory ' of . the country for the . last . ten
years are predicted for the United
States during August, September and
October/ by W. T.I Forster, an unofficial
long-distance forecaster of this city.
Forster's warning is a grave, one. These
storms, he says, will be tropical hurri
canes ' and transcontinental cyclones.
The hurripanes will come from the
south and southwest, off the' Gulf of
Mexico, while the transcontinental
storms " will wend . their way from the
.territory west of the Mississippi Val
ley. .
. Forster makes no attempt to locate
these storms or to tell where they will
reach their greatest force. He confines
himself ;to the announcement that they
wiir come and the destruction with
which they will be attended. |
For days and weeks Forster has been
at work in the library of the naval ob
servatory, completing his maps and fol
lowing conditions throughout the coun
try. So positive is he that his forecast
is correct that he says he could foretell
approximately when the storms would
reach. a certain locality, but that he is
content in stating the fact that the
hurricanes will surely come.

little coasting steamship Seitu.
TOKIO. June 30.â The Russian Vladi

pedo-boats, appeared off Gensan. on iho
east coast of Korea, to-day. Torpedo
boats entered Gensan harbor at 5:30
o'clock in the morning, shelled the set
tlement and sank a small steamship
and a small schooner. The torpedo
boats left the harbor at 7:20 o'clock. A
total of 200 shells was fired Into the set
tlement, but no serious damage re
sulted.
The Russian vessels which took part
In the bombardment of Gensan were

the warships werb first seen at 5:30
o'clock in the morning. Four torpedo

smail steamship and a Junk, while the
cruisers remained outside and shelled
the Japanese barracks on shore. At the
end of a half-hour the Russians with
drew In the midst of a torrential down
pour of rain, which prevented the look
outs noting what direction they took.
The damage inflicted by the Russian
fire was slight and no casualties have
been reported. Further news, how
ever, is expected when the telegraph
wire between Seoul and Gensan. which
was broken bv the storm. Is restored.
The Japanese consulate was hit by a
shell, but the damage Inflicted was
small. At the first shot by the hostile
visitors the citizens fled to the protec

The hearing took place in the pri

DENVER, June SO.â The discovery
this morning of the dead body of Dr.
Seymour Jarecki has furnished a mys
tery which bids fair to rival the famous
Burdick-Pennell case of Buffalo, which
was never solved, though it led to the
death of three of the principal char
acters.
Dr. Jareckl. for the past two years
County Physician, lived with his wife
end two children at 2300 Ogden street-
Last evening he went with his family
to the home of David Michaels at 1424
Columbia street, to attend a social
gathering. He left the Michaels house
about 1 o'clock this morning, his wife
and children remaining over night, and
Â¦went home alone. Shortly after 4
o'clock neighbors heard two shots in
succession from the Jarecki terrace.
After an hour or so an investigation
was started by the neighbors and
Jarecki was found dead on the kitchen
floor with a bullet through his heart.
Beside him was a revolver with two
chambers empty. A hole in the screen
around the kitchen porch showed that
eome one had fired the shot through
the open door and the powder marks
fehowed that the weapon which killed
him was held almost against his breast.
Dr. Jarecki was dressed only in his
night gown, but though he had been
et home almost three hours, the bed
had not been disturbed. His watch.
money and other personal belongincs
were on the dressing-table In his room.
At first glance It looked like a brutal
irurder and the detectives are work
ing on this theory.
A suicide theory has been advanced',
but this Is generally, discredited. . It Js
rumored that Jarecki was murdered
for revenge, and that a relative of a
woman whom he had wronged was re
sponsible for the deed. Dr." Jareckf was
assaulted Jn his office In .the. . Court r
hous- on the afternoon of December
2% last by some persons whose identity
has never been discovered. The de
tectives working Â¦ on the case found
themselves handicapped by the alleged
inability of the ' victim \ to give j them
a description of the .assailant.. . His.
8ctions in regard to the matter and
â¢his apparent disinclination to -talk led
the police to believe that he knew who
his s??ailant was, but refused' to "tell 1
for reasons Iv^st known to hfmgelf* The.
theory of the police was that murdei
end not robbery was th<s object.
A young man riding to his home
*ho passed the Jarecki house yesterday
corning shortly before 4. o'clock saw
:wo men talking in front of the place.
They sermed disconcerted by his ap*
r*aranee and quickly separated. De
scriptions of the men have been-fur
nished the police, and an effort is to
be made to apprehend them.
Jarecki renewed several of his life
Insurance policies on Wednesday, ' and
Lhis fact is the cause of the advance
ment of the suicide theory. Dr. Jarecki
was well-to-do and certainly had no
financial reason for ending his life.
Mrs. Jarecki believes that her hus
band was the victim of a burglar, who
was trying to enter the kitchen door of
the Jarecki home; that he Â¦ arrived
home about 1:30 o'clock, returned
md Tell asleep and was awak
â¢ned by the efforts of the bur
tlar. He went to investigate, she
presumes, and met his death after
grappling with the Invader. The shoot-
Ing was dene at close range, which ac
counts for the powder marks on his
night shirt, and Ehe accounts for the
powder stains on his ' hands ' by pre-"
turning that he held the revolver when
*t v&s fired,' .

LONDON, July i.â The Tokio
correspondent of the Standard
says that Japanese officers who
were engaged in the last naval
fight at Port Arthur assert that
they saw women on board the
Russian warships, and this con
firms the suspicion that the Rus
sians were attempting to escape to
a neutral port and had no inten
tion of fighting.
The Tokio correspondent of the
Times says: "There is considei
able uncertainty here regarding
the Russian losses in the recent
sortie from Port Arthur. It is
just possible that no ship was
sunk. The Peresviet may have
got into Port 'Arthur at night.
The Japanese, on the other hand,
feel certain that three torpedoes
took effect on three ships."

to the testimony of Scanlan and
Murphy, the five followed behind the
negroes, and Gallagher said: "There's
them colored gentlemen; I'll talk to
them." He then got in front of the
pursued men, but when some one in
the crowd said, "Don't say anything to
them," Gallagher tourned away, and as
his back was turned Smith fired the
fatal shot- and Williams dropped to his
knees with a revolver in hia hand
ready for action.

shots were fired in all.
A GENERAL MIX-UP.
Autopsy Surgeon Bacigalupi testified
that it would have been impossible for
the wound to have been made by Smith
if Gallagher had Â¦â¢Â¦not been facing the
negro at the time the shot was fired.
The bullet entered, he said, about an
inch above the right ear and ranged
backward and downward, lodging
against the base of the skull on the left
side. Others testified that the two ne
groes were attacked by .a crowd of un
ion men and that a white man behind a
post on Post street fired several shots
with a revolver at Smith, Gallagher be
ing between the shooter and the negro.
F. W. Ellis, a merchant at 1774 Post
street, testified that he heard a young
man say to two or three boys standing
on the corner of Post and Polk streets:
'.'Hold on; keep out of that," referring
to the actions of a crowd of men on
the opposite side of the street. He saw
six or eight men crossing Post street
diagonally, following Smith and Wil
liams. The crowd closed in on the ne
groes and there was an interchange of
blows and four pistol shots. The wit
ness saw Gallagher fall and another
man fall directly on top of him.. The
witness continued:
A white man on Post street deliberately and.
I think, maliciously, fired several shots at
the nogrws and then went up Poet street
toward Van Ness avenue. At the time they
were attacked by 'the crowd the colored men
were soins along peaceably about their busl

BACIGAIAJIFI'S EVIDENCE.
"We, the jury, find that the said An
thony Owen Gallagher came to his
death on June 25, 1904, from a gunshot
wound in the head from a pistol in the
hands of a colored man named James
H. Smith. Whether fired with criminal
intent or not the evidence is too con
flicting for us to determine."
Such was the verdict returned by a
Coroner's jury yesterday afternoon in
the case of the union stableman 'who
was killed by James H. Smith, a non
union negro stableman. In a revolver
battle at the intersection of Post and
Polk streets.
Said Coroner Leland: "I never heard
more peculiar evidence. Each witness
seemed to see the affair from a differ
ent standpoint. The 'evidence seems to
show that the shot which killed Gal
lagher was fire.d by Smith. I will ap
prove the verdict as it stands."
After a copy of the verdict had been
submitted to the District Attorney,
Judge Fritz issued a warrant for the
arrest of James H. Smith and Arthur
Williams on the charge of murder. The
complaint was sworn to by Edward
Giblin. The charge was immediately
booked against the prisoners.
The evidence at the Coroner's Inquest
was 'more than conflicting. There was
apparently rank perjury on one side or
the other. Union stablemen swore that
Smith had not been molested at all and
that Gallagher had his back turned to
the negro when the fatal shot was fired.

The damage at Kronstadt was con
fined to the torpedo mechanism shops,
which were almost wholly destroyed,
together with twenty whitehead tor
pedoes. Five of the torpedoes had war
heads attached, and they exploded,
which edded to the fire and excite

stored In the works also was burned.
An alarm was given in time to prevent
loss of life and more serious loss of
property.
, The authorities do not attach much
importance to the accident, -and say
the works will soon be able to resume
full time.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 30.â As a
result of the receipt of news of a fire
which took place at the torpedo works
at-Kronstadt last night, this city was
to-night filled with the wildest rumors,
including one to the effect that the
Peterhof palace had been blown up.

WASHINGTON, June 30.â While the
officials here are satisfied from their
private advices that the recent visit of
King Edward to his nephew. Emperor
William, was not brought about by a
purpose to initiate a movement toward
the restoration of peace between Russia
and Japan, there is no reason to believe
that some very careful and discreet
inquiries as to the opportuneness of
overtures at this time have emanated
from Washington. It may be stated
that the result has been to disclose
the fact that neither of the belligerent
powers is yet in a humor to sue for
peace, nor even to entertain overtures
from any third poww. â¢ . ;
The State Department will continue
to maintain the friendly position it has
so far held toward both Russia and
Japan, standing ready to mediate and
extend its good offices to the full when
ever the belligerents indicate their â¢wil
lingness to accept them.
LONDON, June 30. â The news fr6m
Washington that steps were believed
to have been taken looking to media
tion between Russia and Japan creates
great surprise here. The British gov
ernment not only has taken no part in
such measures, but apparently is igno
rant that they were in progress.
Official opinion here, from Premier
Balfour down, is that the time is not
yet ripe for any offer of mediation: but.
to cuote a person in Balfour's confi
dence. "Great Britain has kept the door
'open for any such contingency." It is
not likely that this government would
be acceptable in the role of arbitrator,
but it would at the right time use all
its influence to urge the belligerents to

"Kuropatkin may still be forced to

his withdrawal after all that he has

defensive campaigning."
COPENHAGEN, June 30. â "Kuro
patkin is wiser than all his critics. He
is conducting* ' an arduous campaign
with signal ability, and instead of
losing reputation in Manchuria, he
promises to emerge from the ordeal

even though Russia should be beaten.
My opinion is based' on acquaintance
with the main factors . of the case.
The Czar's commander .in chief is
managing a small ormy against over
whelming numbers with skill and ef
fectiveness unsurpassed, if equaled,
in modern war.- I remember that Ku
ropatkin said before leaving St. Pe

This declaration was made to-day
by a prominent European soldier, who
.had been stopping at Copenhagen for
a fortnight on his way home from St.'
Petersburg. He is familiar with the
Far East from personal "observation,
speaks Russian fluently and is per
sona grata at the Czar's court..
' "Think what Kuropatkin has done,"
he went on. "The war is almost 'five
months old and yet the Russians,
flanked on sea, where the Japanese
are supreme, and beset along a 200

Russians poured a deadly artillery fire
upon the attackers and the Japanese
artillery secured a new position and
delivered a heavy cross fire upon the
Russian lines of defense. While this
was proceeding the Japanese infantry
and engineers cleared tho obstructions
from the Russian rear and closed in
upon the enemy. The Russians broke
and fled at 11:20 o'clock on Monday

TOKIO'S ACCOUNT OP BATTLE.
TOKIO, June 30.â Detailed reports of
the capture of Fenshui Pass on June
27 show that he Russians were driven
from an exceedingly strong position
dominating the Shlmucheng road. In
this engagement the Russian losses
were again heavier than those of the
Japanese. The Japanesa out-maneuw
ered the Russians **-' working around
the enemy's right flank and attacking
him in the rear.
The Japanese advanced in three col
umns. One was assigned to deliver a
frontal attack and the others to strike
the enemy on the flanks. The column
which advanced upon the Russian right
flank fought a separate action. It en
countered three battalions of infantry,
six guns and two machine guns on
Sunday morning. This engagement
lasted until sunset Sunday. At this
hour the Japanese bivouacked, and re
.nevved the assault at midnight, when
they succeeded in defeating the Rus
sians.
"A section of the Eleventh Horse
Battery, which participated in the
fighting, astonished everybody by its
gallantry in pushing on so far as the
Shanhai Pass and holding its own
against eight of the enemy's guns un
til its ammunition was exhausted.
"Our losses have not been ascertained
definitely, but they are reported not to
exceed fifty men and twenty horses.
"A battalion and a squadron of the
Japanese vanguard on June 26, operat
ing north of the Siuyen-Kaichou road
occupied Châ¬*luangtien, four miles
northeast of Siakhouhung.
"A concentration toward evening of
twenty-six Japanese battalions was ob
served near the village of Wangtsla

BROWN 31 EN CAPTURE TASS.
"From the morning of June 27 the
Japanese developed a frontal attack
against our troops in Ta Pass, simul
taneously turning our right with at
least a division of infantry and three
field batteries. The fight lasted until
7:30 o'clock in the evening. In view of
the enemy's great strength and the
turning movement, our troops retired
slowly from the pass. The enemy did
not advance. Our losses are undeter
mined, but are estimated at about 200.
"On June 26 the* enemy continued to
advance from Fenshui and Motien
passes, frontally and flanking. At least
eight battalions and ten guns were con
centrated against Motien Pass.
"At 4 o'clock on the morning of June
2G a detachment of the enemy (near
ly an infantry brigade, with two bat
teries) occupied Santiao, firing on our
outposts occupying Black Mountain.
Our three companies firmly held their
ground until reinforced. At 6 o'clock
in the morning a battery of Cossacks
and a mountain battery took up a
position and opened fire on the front
and flank of a Japanese battery and
dense columns of infantry, which had
appeared against our left. At 1 p. m.
the Japanese began to retire, pressed
by our troops, who had assumed the
offensive, and pursued the enemy as
far as Santiao. Our losses were six
soldiers killed and two officers and
thirty-three, men wounded.
"The battle recommenced at 6 o'clock
in the morning. A Cossack battery ana
a mounted battery repeatedly pursued
the enemy's infantry and silenced the
Japanese batteries. A section of our
infantry repulsed the Japanese on out
right. The fightHig ceased at 5 o'clock.
"There was some skirmishing on June
25 between the enemy and our outposts
five miles west of Samiarlkau.

CHEFU. June SO.â European and
Chinese refugees from Port Arthur tel!
widely different stories of the result of
the naval engagement of Thursday,
June 23. The Europeans say that the
battleship Sevastopol and the trans
port Amur only were damaged and that
The Lieutenant Burukoff is one of
the torpedo-boat destroyers tate?n from
the Chinese at Taku in 1^00. The gen
eral belief here is that she* ran Admiral
Togo's blockade and tame here with
dispatches for the army and for St.
Petersburg. This would be quite nat
ural, as two Cossack officers are on
board.
The Russians last night celebrated
the arrival of the Lieutenant Burukoff.
Bands of music from the camp east of
the town were sent to the Administra
tor's house, where there was singing
and a champagne dinner.

Burukoff arrived here from Port Ar

officers of the Lieutenant Burukoff tell
several stories. One is that Admiral
Togo's report of the fighting was ex
aggerated and that the Russians have
made two cruises in the Gulf of Pechili
in five days. Another is that the Port
Arthur fleet has joined the Vladivostok
squadron. "^ .'â¢
no ships were sunk. The Chinese say
it was reported at Port Arthur that
one large warship was sunk, . while
three were damaged.
The European refugees declare that

erecting a large fort, which commands
the harbor of Port Arthur, but which is

Whereyer the streets were thickly
crowded generous responses were re
ceived on all sides. A large crowd, mar
shalod by iTom Patterson, Colorado's
Junior Senator, accompanied the dele
gates to the station and gave them
cheers on their departure.
Upon pulling out of Denver, the Cali
fornians had the good fortune, for
them, to run into a genuine Eastern
lightning and thunder storm. It was
the first time that many of the young
persons on board had witnessed this
spectacle and it would be difficult to
say> whether they were more frightened
or pleased at the experience.
Not as many delegates are beins: add
ed to the train as was expected on leav
ing San Francisco;* Only one or two
have come aboard and disappointing
excuses for the rest were the order of
the hour. This has no,t served to damp
en the delegates in their fight for Cali
fornia's, candidate, however, and thft
nearer their destination they get the
louder they seem to shout."

of ceremonies and introduced the ora

New Mexico and another from Colonel

continuity of the travel by a few
hours' recreation and sightseeing in
Colorado's capital. The most enthusi
astic reception so far received was
there accorded the delegation. A com
mittee of the Denver Democratic Club
met the delegation at the Union Depot
when the train pulled in at. the noon
hour. Luncheon was served at ' the
Democratic. Cluby, and at the. Brown
Palace Hotel. A special -sightseeing

about two Hours were enjoyaSly spent
in viewing the points of interest in

The Californians took advantage of the
occasion to work up as much Hearst

PROHIBITION' PLATFORM.
Following is the full text of the plat
form adopted to-day:
The Prohibition party in National Conven
tion assembled, recognizing that the chief end
of all government | s the establishment of those
principles of righteousness and . justice that
have been revealed to man as the will of the
ever-living God, and doelrlngr his blessinB upon
cur national life, and believing in the perpetua
tion of high ideals of government of the peo
ple, by the people and for the people, estab
lished by our fathers, makes the following dec
laration of principles and purposes:
1. The widely prevailing system of the
licensed and legalized sale of alcoholic bev
erages is so ruinous to individual interests, so
ir.imioal to public welfare, so destructive to
national xveal and so subversive to the rights of
great masses of our citlzenphlp that the dft
â¢tructlon of the traffic is and for years has
been the most important question in American
politics.
?. We denounce the lack of statesmanship
exhibited by the leaders of the Democratic
and Republican parties in their refusal to rec
ognize the paramount importance of this ques
tion and the cowardice with which the loiJU
ers of those parties have courted the favor of
those whose selfish interests are advanced by
the continuation and augmentation of the traf
fic, until to-day the influence of the liquor
traffic practically dominates national. State and
local government throughout the nation.
3. We declare the truth, demonstrated by
the experience of half a century, th|it all meth
ods of dealing with the liquor traffic which rec
ognize its right to exist In any form, under
any system of license or tax or regulation, have
proved powerless to remove ite evils 'and use
less as checks upon its growth, while, the in
significant public revenues which have accrued
therefrom have scared the public conscience
against a recognition of its iniquity.
4. We call public attention to the fact,
proved by the experience of more than fifty
years, that to secure the enactment and en
forcement of prohibitory legislation, in which
alone lies hope of the protection of the people
from the liquor traffic, it is necessary that the
legislative, executive and judicial branches of
the CovernTrerit should Â«be in the hands of a
political party in harmony with the prohibition
principle and pledged to Its embodiment in
law and to the execution of those laws.
5. We pledge the Prohibition party, wher
ever given power by the suffrage of the. people,
to the enactment and enforcement of laws pro
hibiting and abolishing the manufacture, im
portation, transportation and sale if alcoholic
beverages.
C. We declare that there Is not only no
other issue of equal Importance before the
American people to-day, but that the so-called
Is-sucs upon which the Democratic and Re
publican parties seek to divide the electorate
of the country are in large part subterfuges,
under the cover of which they range for the
spoils of office.
7. Recognizing that the intelligent voters of
the country may properly ask our attitude upon
other questions of public concern, we declare
ourselves in favor of:
The impartial enforcement of all laws.
The safeguarding of the people's rights by a
rigid application of the principles of justice to
all combinations and organizations of capital
and labor. â¢
A more Intimate relation between the peoiile
and Government by a wise adaptation of Ac
principle of initiative and referendnm. .
The safeguarding to every citizen In every
place under the Government of the people of
the United State* of. all the rights guaranteed
by the laws and constitution.
International arbitration, and declare that
our nation should contribute in every manner,
consistent with national dignity, to the perma
nent establishment of peace between all na
tion*. '-Â¦Â¦ â¢ t .
! The reform of our divorce laws, extirpation
of noU'fÂ»rny and the total overthrow of the
present ebameful system of illegal sanction of
the social evil with its unspeakable traffic in
girls, by the municipal authorities of almost all
our cities. â¢ â¢ N
We declare ourselves in favor of the recogni
tJon of the fact that the right df suffrage
should depend upon the mental and moral
qualifications of the citizen)?.
We declare ourselves in favor of such changes
in our laws as will place tariff schedules in
, the hands of a non-partisan commission.
. We declare ourselves in favor of the appli
cation of uniform laws for all our country and
dei>endencies.
We declare ourselves In favor of the ex
tension and honest administration of the civil
service laws.
We declare ourselves in favor of the election
of United States Senators by vote of th*
people. -.._â¢.

INDIANAPOLIS. Ind., June 30.â The
Prohibition party in national conven
tion to-day nominated Silas C. Swal
Â¦ low of Pennsylvania for President and
George W. Carroll of Texas for Vice
Piesident. The platform was adopted
without argument after a long dead
lock in the resolutions committee. It
v.a? described by A. H. Amos of Ore-
K'Â«n. Ffcretary of the committee, as the
liroa<3c-j?t platform ever placed before
the neopie by that party.
In addition to the planks on the
liquor question it declares the party
in be in favor of international arbitra
tion, a suffrage law based on mental
and moral qualifications, unifornj-laws
{tar the country and dependencies, pop
ular election of Senators, civil service
extension and the initiative and refer
endum. The trust question was recc-g
rized by a demand for a rigid applica
tion of the principles of justice to all
orsanizations of rapital and labors A
loform of divorce laws was demanded
and polygamy was denounced.
MILES DECLINES ' HONOR.

WASHINGTON, June 30.â William
R. Hearst, fresh from an hour's inter
view with -John R. McLean of Ohio,
said to-day that he and his friend j
would cheerfully abide by the decision
of the St. Louis convention and enthu T
siastically support the Democratic nom
inees for President and Vice President,
whoever they might be.
"The Democrats must get together,"
said Hearst, "nominate a ticket and
adopt a platform that will convince
every one that the party has a great
mission to perform,, and then they must
enter the campaign aggressively and
confidently and make a spirited fight
from now until election. We must su
bordinate all personal ambitions to the
supreme purpose of winning a truly
Democratic victoryâ a victory that will
surely redound to the benefit of the
people."
"If Mr. Cleveland should be nom
inated would you support him?" Hearst
was asked. :
Hearst paused for a moment, frowned
faintly and then smiled.
"Well," he said. "I have supported
Cleveland three times for the Presi
dency, and I am inclined to think that
is enough. I shall, however, abide by
the decision of the convention, whoever
the nominee may be. But why discuss
Cleveland as a serious possibility? He
is merely brought forward by shrewd
politicians in the hope of forcing the
radicals into a compromise on some re
organizer less objectionable."
WILL. SUPPORT THIS TICKET.
Hearst Decides to Abide by the St.
Louis Convention's Decision.
Some Western delegates arrived to
day. Senator Fred Dubols of Idaho,
when asked what he thought of the
Presidential outlook, said he saw noth
ing but Parker. .
"Who will they nominate after they
have beaten Parker?" he said. "Would
it be Cleveland? Why, more, than a
third of the convention would stay here
until .the election before allowing the
nomination of Cleveland. An attempt
to nominate Cleveland will throw the
convention into the hands of Bryan.
The convention will fiomlnate Parker
because it has no other man to nomi
nate."
Senator Dubois declares that he will
get an anti-polygamy plank into the
national platform.
Former Senator George Turner of
Washington, came to St. Louis to-day
with a small but earnest Vice Presiden
tial boom. The States of Idaho and
YÂ»~-hington are instructed to vote for
Turner for that position and the few
delegates from that region are making
a little stir about a Pacific Coast man
for second place.
But nobody wants Cleveland. The
difficulty about the Parker opposition
making headway is that, aside from
Bryan.and Hearst, it is not aggressive.
Not much atetntion is paid to the hos
tility of Tammany Hall/and there is a
feeling here that Murphy's support of
Cleveland is prompted only by a desire
to defeat Parker, in the hope that then
Mayor McClellan will be the choice.
There are really no signs yet of any
check in the Parker tide, which is still
rising. Every Democrat of prominence
who has been interviewed here^ ex
pressed the opinion that Parker would
be the choice of the convention. This
is based entirely on the belief that
Parker will have at least a majority of
the convention at the start, and that
any man who gets that is certain of
the nomination.
There is a very general feeling here
that Cleveland is the only man who can
bear Parker before the convention, and
many delegates do not share the an
tipathy of the Missouri Democrats to
ward the former President. Indeed, one
hears the frequent claim that there
would be doubt about Cleveland's elec
tion should he be the nominee.
That the platform will not meet Bry
an's views ia indicated by the general
intention of the leaders to make no
mention of the former Bryan platforms
in the resolutions.
to prevent any mention of that insur
rectionary document.
The belief is- growing here that,
whatever the convention may do,
whether a compromise is offered or not,
Bryan will refuse to support the ticket
and will do so because the platform
does not meet his views. "V;

AJVXBTISEJIEirrS.
The Marvelous
Physician.
His unexceptional success in curing
chronic diseases of long standing which
were previously considered incurable is
the sole cause of his overwhelming re-
ception in San Francisco.
TMs is not a supernatural gift or rev-
elation, as is so often proclaimed by
fal*e pretenders, but the result of Dr.
ABBOS undivided attention and many
years' devotion to the study of diseases
to which the family practitioner pays
but little attention, and only thinks that
your trouble is imaginary on your part.
Dr. ABBO has attended more than one
thousand patients within the last month
and hears nothing but praise from all
who hnve accepted his treatment.
He uses his own system of medicine,
but by no means makes an apothecary
shop of your stomach.
He is thoroughly equipped with every
form of modern devices for making ex-
aminations. Microscopically, chemically.
X-Ray nnd by his own individual krowl-
?flge of the Anatomical and Physiologi-
cal conditions of the human body. He
xnpki-s a perfect diagnosis of both cause
iind condition and results of your dis-
ease, which, therefore, enables him to
treÂ«t you Fitisfactorily and perfect cure.
While Dr. ABBO cures a large per-
<f*r ; t;e<Â» of so-called incurable diseases,
he d<xs not claim to cure regardless of
thÂ«* condition of the person whom he is
treating, and reserves the right to pro-
nounce as curable, or tell them that they
cen only be relieved.
F REE OFFER LIMITED.
, All who call at the Institute before
JVjly 3 will receive a thorough examina-
tion absolutely free of charge and one
month's treatment for the actual cost of
medicines and appliances.
FREE FOR ONE MONTH.
Remember that this offer is good for
one month only, ard only to those who
apply before July 3.
DR. ABBO NOT A STRANGER.
Hear what Mr. Calvin F. Vaughn of
Bell Station has to say:
"There is perhaps? no city in the world
more infested with 'quacks.' traveling
doctors and all-around fakes than San
Vra:ieiseo. and the uninformed person is
not able ensily to distinguish the genu-
ine from the false."
Dr. Abbo publishes the following in
order to correct *ny false notions in the
minds of any concerning himself:
STATEMENT CF MR. VAUGHN.
Mr. Vaughn, who was formerly post-
master at Bell Station, says:
"i have known Dr. Abbo favorably for
a number of years. More than two years
ago he treated successfully my wife for
a serious malady, which had bafHed the
ekill of a number of doctors, and I nat-
urally, hold his medical ability In high
esteem.
"He also cured my neighbor. Mr. J G
Bell, of blindness. Mr. Bell had been al-
most totally "blind for a number of years
and his case given up as helpless Dr
Abbo restored his sight and only ' the
other day Mr. Bell told me his sight had
remained good, and he could see nearly
as well as he over could. I say this in
justice to Dr. Abbo. who is a permanent
resident and in no sense to be classed
with the^arrny of traveling fakes.

Twenty-five of the non-union men
employed at the yards of the Southern
Pacific Company at Townsend street
were discharged last night. Every one
of the men who were let out is classed
as "no good." The officials say all the
freight can be handled by the men now
In the sheds. More men are being
brought in, however, and the full crews
are being recruited from time to time.
The sleeping departments and the din
ing-rooms are maintained as they were
established when the union men first
went on strike. The headquarters of
the union shows little sign of activity,
as the majority of the men have found
employment in other callings. Several
conferences have been held between
the union men and the company offi
cials, but no definite result has been
reached. â¢ jfiSE
There Is a rumor among the union
men that charges will be entered with
the Board of Health regarding the san
itary condition of the apartments used
by the. men now working in the sheds,
,but it is only a rumor. None of the offi
cers of the Freight "Handlers* Union
will stand sponsor for the statement,
though a number of the men say the
matter is to be taken up by the author
ities of the Health Board. The rail
way officials scout the idea and say the

observing every sanitary law of * the

A quiet Chinese wedding, without
Oriental. music or samshiu, was cele
brated yesterday afternoon In the of
fice of the Chinese Bureau. The
happy couple were Leo James Bo
fonda. a wealthy Chinese merchant
of Colorado Springs, aged 43, and Miss
Lew Wong Shee. aged 22. Rev. Dr.
John Endicott Gardiner of the bureau
and Rev. C. F. Reid of the Oakland
M. E. Church were the officiating
clergymen.
Mr. Bofonda arrived on the steamer
Coptic on June 8 with the woman, who
claimed to be his wife. The Chinese
Bureau, however, had a record that
Bofonda had been married to another
woman several years ago. Bofonda
explained that his first wife had died,
and that two years ago he had mar
ried Miss Lew in China. United States
Immigration Commissioner North de
cided that they should be married In
the American way. or else the woman
should not be landed, so that a prose
cution for bigamy might be held
should It be learned that Bofonda's
statement was not the truth.

The prospects of Republican success
in' both district's are cheering. The
conventions of the party, however, will
not be held until late in September,
but in the meantime the party leaders
in every Assembly district will put for
ward their best efforts to obtain a
large registration of Republican voters.
At the next meeting of the Republi
can County Committee plans for the
organization of district clubs will be
reported and probably adopted..
Gavin McXab will be compelled to
make another fight on August 9 in
order to retain possession of the Demo
cratic works. The fight will come on
the election of delegates to the local
nominating convention.
The anti-McN'ab forces, under the
leadership of Jim O'Brien of the horse
and cart wing of the party, will surely
make a determined effort to capture
the convention and nominate the can
didates for the judiciary and the Legis
lature. Tarpey. O'Brien and others who
are opposing. McNab may not put up
an organized flght to win the city dele
gations to the Democratic State" Con
vention, because even a sweeping vic
tory in the metropolis would not elect
a sufficient number of delegates to
overcome McNab's superior strength
in the country. It Is predicted that the
edversaries of McNab' will first en
deavor to win the local convention,
and later on -organize for efforts "in a
wider field of action. Tarpey is already
.slated for Democratic national commit
teeman: but, as the chances of Demo
cratic success in the national contest
are dim, there -will be no flocking of
patronage-seeking Democrats to the
Tarpey camp: It is quite well under
stood that Tarpey will participate in
the struggle to oust McNab. Common
gossip in the, political camps is to the
effect that the attitude of James D.
Phelan, E. B. Pond. J. V. Coleman,
Â¦Washington Dodge. J. C. Sims and
other well-known Democratic states
men wil! not be defined until the nom
inations a're made at St, Louis. "If the
convention should stampede to Cleve
land, the .high-toned Democrats would
go wild with joy and McNab would
rejoice. â¢
Local political experts predict that
there Will be three candidate* for Con
gress in the Fourth and also three in
the Fifth Congressional District. The
fusion two "years ago, which resulted
in the election of Wynn and Livernash
and the defeat of the Republican nom
inees, has disappointed all the parties
concerned.
It is asserted that the Democrats
will have nothing to do with fusion this
year, but "on the contrary will make
straight out nominations with a view
of strengthening . the party organiza
tion. It is also common gossip that
the Union Labor party will make di
rect nominations and not waste any
time or effort in negotiations for Dem
ocratic indorsement. The courts have
decided that the Hardes-Bergis county
committee of the Union Labor party
Is the governing- body of the organiza
tion and the petition emanating from
that faction for a place on the prim
ary election ballots will probably be
recognized. The followers of Schmitz
and" Eagan. while not holding legal
possession of the works, are accredited
with strength in the several districts
sufficient to elect a majority of dele
gates to each of the Congressional dis
trict conventions.

Roup, a diseasethat attacks chickens
\vit{i deadly effect and brings immense
annual losses to the poultry raisers of
the State, is being thoroughly investi
gated by the scientists at the Univer
sity of California in the hope that it
may be- conquered. It is a disease that
has Jongr resisted the attacks of the
scientific men, but it is likely to be
overcome if dealt with systematically.
A campaign has already been lauched^
by Professor A. R. Ward, professor of
veterinary science and bacteriology,
who has just returned from the poultry
farms of Petaluma. It is. proposed to
treat all the affected chickens differ-;
ently, following, suggestions from ex
perience and- various sources. .. Out of
a large number of these treatments It
is thought that at. least one; cure, may
be found. Professor Ward'- adminis
tered to 250 chickens, while at" Petaluma
and found that the most'isuccess was
obtained by injecting kerosene Into
their nostrils. It is by no means cer
tain, however, that .kerosene reaches
the disease, and it will be a long time
before its enicacy, if there is any at all,
is determined.
Roup manifests itself by a swelling of
the heads of the fowls. It is supposed
that it* is caused by colds, due to im
properly ventilated 'chicken houses.
Science has not determined whether it
is a contagious disease, and this will
be one of the aims of the investigation
now going on.

. I For many, years attempts have been made In
â¢-.eeve.rar â¢ cities to bring about what has been
. dÂ«Â«Â«igjia.teji as a. "sane celebration of the na
tion's Birthday." In Chicago this year a se
rious attempt was made in this direction, but
with." such a" lack of success that an official

those least .likely tb injure any one, and to

No. person has any more risht to carry a
cfcncealed weapon on the Fourth of July than
he has on any other day; neither has he per
mission, to discharge it within the .confines of

tice, .and you are hereby instructed to arrest
any person found carrying a concealed weapon
or discharging firearms of any character within
the rrescribed boundaries of the city during
the Fourth of July holidays.
The custom of discharging plstoln and other
firearms on the public streets of this city or on
about the Fourth of July has become so prev
alent of late years that" even the members of
this department seem to be under the impres
sion that the lawn are /suspended ft>r the time
being, and that 'concealed deadly weapons can
be ran fed and discharged at will, thereby en
dangering the lives of innocent people. " The
rowdy and luxxilum element tRke advantage
of this, which adds greatly to the danger and
annoyance to-, whfch peaceable, citizens are

Owing to the danger from lire occasioned

desires to call the attention of property
owners and residents to the riÂ»ed of using

The Board of Fire Commissioners,
through Acting Chief Engineer John
Dougherty, has issued the following
notice to the public:
The â¢ board , established a training
schoof for nurses in the 'Emergency
Hospital aeryice.. ;
Mrs. C. "Reed was appointed nurse at
the almshouse at $30 per month.-
The owners of premises at 168, 170 and
.172 Russ street were cited to appear be
fore . the board to show cause why , the
premises should not be* condemned as
unsanitary. . '
Health Officer Ragan recommended
that the Board of Works .establish a
sewer system in the Excelsior Home
stead district. ' ".-Â¦-. ' /
J..Wrede was appointed night watch
-man at the County :Â¦. Hospital.
The premises at 111, Prospect place
were 'ordered vacated within ten days
owing to their unsanitary condition.

Dr. Frank Hart was apointed resi
dent physician at the City and County
Hospital at a nominal salary of $25 per
month, to .succeed T>r. F. H. Zumwalt.
who resigned. The latter received " a
vote o"f thanks for his services in the
past.
Frank Meredith was appointed stew
ard at the hospital at $35 per month.
.The resignation of E. Coffey, apothe
cary at the hospital, was accepted.
E. Kendall, was appointed assistant
chemist in the bacteriological depart
ment at -a. salary of $85 per n^onth. His
old position as chemist's helper paid
$75. Â¦ â¢
Dr. W. Lawlor. receiving clerk at the
City Hospital, had the designation 'of
his office changed to medical supervisor
at the same salary of $100 per month.
. James P. McQuaide, who, as assistant
warden, has not received any salary
owing to a protest by the Civil Service
Commission, was made chief ward ten
der,* a. newly created position, at $123
per mXmth, and Thomas Reardon was
â¢appointed assistant ward tender.
The board adopted a resolution recit
ing that as the appropriation of $75,400
made by the Supervisors for the City
and County Hospital would result in
the reduction of the per capita for 425
patients and 157 attendants to 34 cents
per day the Chief- Warden be directed
riot to receive any patients in excess of
425. As there are now 436 patients in
the institution the action of the board
means that no more patients will be
i^celved until the number falls below
425. This will work a hardship on the
sick poor as the applicants number
from five to ten daily.
The board appointed Rev. Father
Casey of St. Peter's Church and Rev.'
Mr. Kelly of the Episcopalian diocese
to be officiating clergymen at the City
and County Hospital, at- a -salary of
$100 per month each, in .accordance
with a specific appropriation made for
the purpose by the Supervisors.
â¢ MAKES APPOINTMENTS.
The salary of Health Officer Ragan
was increased from $200 to $265 per
momth and that of .Chief Inspecting
Physician Hassler from $210 to $250 per
month, bnt the officials must pay for
their own transportation. Deputy
Health Officer Levy was made' happy
by an Increase from $150 to $175 per
month.
Of the force of inspecting physicians
Drs. C. H. Glover and D". W. Goodale
were dropped from the roll' and Drs.
H. H. Hanna and W. J. Walsh were
retained.
Dr. C. .F. Welty was appointed as
sistant pity physician, to serve without
salary. .
Dr. J. W. Ward, president of the
board, submitted a statement explain
ing the reasons for the reduction in
the force and the abolishing of the
food department.
Health Officer Ragan filed the fol
lowing report on dairy inspection dur
ing June:
I am pleased .to report that the action oi
your board In dealing vigorously with the milk
and dairy problem has already been productive
of good results. We are at present engaged
with thÂ« Hospital and Health Committee of
the Boar'd of Supervisors In framing aa ordi
nance regulating the conduct of dairies. Pend
ing, this action, rnany of the dairies have begun
the work of cleaning, and It is safe to say
that at least $10,000 has been expended by thÂ«
dairymen of San Francisco In cleaning up their
dairies, and the work is still going on. Many
of the dairymen are proceeding slowly, await
ing tlie action of the Board of Supervisors and
the framing of this particular ordinance.
Dairies whicji but a month ago were officially
rated as. filthy may now be rated as in good
sanitary . Condition, but further rating of the
sanitary condition of the dairies will be post
poned until the disposition of our dairy rules
by the Board of Supervisors. .
The Board of Health yesterday car
ried out its announced intention to re
organize the Health Department so as
to live within the reduced appropria
tion allowed by the Supervisors. In
doing so a number of subordinates lost
their positions. Certain posit'ons were
abolished, others were created in their
stead and several officials were for
tunate in having their salaries raised
notwithstanding the board's repeated
declaration in the resolutions on the
subject that retrenchment, was abso
lutely necessary.
Important among the changes was
the abolishing of the positions of dis
trict health officers held by Drs. Dillon,
Adler and Tillman. Drs. Tillman and
Adler were, however, immediately re
appointed as laboratory-medical assist
ants at a salary of 5125 per month,
or $25 less than they were receiving
as district officers, thus leaving Dr.
Dillon, as the only one removed. '
The food inspection department was
abolished and in its stead a so-called
"laboratory department" was estab
lished, with H. C. Bothe, formerly in
dustrial ch'emist, as superintendent
thereof. Bothe's salary* was raised
from $175 to $210 per month," but he
will have to pay his own transporta
tion. _..:-;
The position of chief food Inspector,
held by W. C. Robertson, was abolish
ed, but Robertson was appointed labor
atory assistant at a salary of $100, or
$2Â» less than he was receiving.
The positions" of food inspectors were
all abolished, but J. L. Derham and T.
l*ydon were Tetainad as "laboratory as
sistants and apprentices" at $100 per
month, a reduction of $15 in their sal
aries. Food Inspectors D. Reardon, O.
S. Mish, J. .T. Sllvera and F. Murphy
wene dropped from the service owing
to inadequate funds.
Dr. Beatrice Hinkle had her. position
as assistant city physician abolished,
but she was - appointed factory and
workshop inspector, at $100 per month,
in place of James Reavy, . who was
ousted. The position of bakery, bath
and laundry inspector, held by T. F.
Dolan, was also abolished. â¢ .

â¢ Tft-e Chinaman is the embodiment of
the buslnesa spirit, -and the* established
principles of frame permeate even the
soldlej ranks. The secret of China's
inglorious military career, in- recent
years Is that tKe rank and file- had not
been paid. The Chinaman's ruling pas
sion fo'r business displayed Itself in the
war with Japan. A general in the Jap
anese army told me that after the 'first
fire from Jiis regiment of Infantry the
"Chinese "troops" arrayed against him
disappeared; like a mist. Not long
thereafter they reappeared In the r<;ar
of his armV; retailing vegetables to his
soldiers. * Nevertheless, he was confi
dent,* "there "was no lack o'f bravery
among these thrifty deserters. Inquiry
'developed that they had' not been paid
their wages," and that they lived In no
expectation that their _ miserable- cash
allotment as heroes would ever come
their way.; When they. could coin an
opportunity into profit, the alternative
â of inglorlouslv facing the firing line
without payâ naturally failed ; to kindle
martlal^zeal.â Harold Bolce in the July

THE -CALL raised an early warning against the un
checked violence that early appeared in the stable
men's strike. Up to this time more than a score
of assaults* have been committed upon non-union work
ingmen,.and most of-the- victims have- been severely in
jured,- some of them are permanently impaired in their
capacity to earn a living, and one has suffered perhaps
permanent brain trouble by being "brutally kicked on tlie
head when he had fallen insensible from blows.
'Identification and proof the most direct failed to pun
ish one of the men arrested . for one of thes*c outrages.
A jury found him not guilty "in the face of proof that
was unimpeachabJe. This absolute and sinister sur
render of the law and paralysis of its functions only em
boldened the mistaken men who have been raiding the
town: On Saturday night a group of them, reported to
.be five in number, attacked two workingmen and felled
one to the sidewalk, and it is said fired at the other, who
returned the fire, killing one of his assailants. The blood
of'the" dead .man Js not upon the head of the man 'who
only defended. himself! It is upon the heads of the jury,
which gave immunity, to violence and "outrage by its ver
dict of acquittal in. a similar case," and it is upon every
man whose duty it is to enforce the \faw and" who has
negUcted that duty. - '
Immediately following this tragic culmination to th
immuriity given to; disorder was a cowardly assault' up
on a non-union freight handler of the Southern 'Pacific
THE EXPECTED HAPPENS.
The first American, warboat built in the Philippines
has been -launched in Manila Bay, and will do, patrol
duty on the rivers, and inland waters of the islands.
Let us hope that Uncle Sam may never be compelled to
construct another and may he be ready soon to sell

HEADQUARTERS OF TtfE.CALL,
C HENRIETTA STREET; COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON. June 16.â It is a
queer quest' which Robert Shaw of
Grimsby has undertaken and which, by
advertisements In the newspapers of
this country, he beseeches all and-sun
dry who have any knowledge of the
matter to assist him. He wants to find
out 'who wereith*e parents of the little
girl "with light blue eyes, light flaxen
hair and a fair skin" who fifty-one
years ago was kidnaped from her home
near Manchester. His own particular
interest lfcs in the fact that this little
eirl subsequently became -his wife.
That was thirty-six years ago. and last
March she. died. Now that he has lost
her Shaw has set himself the task of
discovering: who she was and establish
ing her identity. That there is some
romantic mystery connected with" her
early life seems certain, but after such
a long lapse of time it Is extremely
doubtful if he wHl succeed in unravel
ing it. r,' Â¦; '..-.: : :" : ;
"When he first made her acquaintance
she. was an attractive laps of 17 years'
and living: in Hull with a mature
.widow, Mrs. Payne, whom she had been
taught to call "Grannie." Mrs. Payne
was strongly to the girl's'mar
riage to young Shaw, hinting -myste
riously that If she came by her own
6he 'might some day wed a lord. His
sweetheart told Shaw that she could
distinctly remember when she was a
very small- child playing In a beautiful
garden in -front of a big house with
stone steps. Suddenly a dark woman
leaned over, the wall and offered her
some candy. When she stretched out a
hand to take" It the stranger grasped
her and pressed- a handkerchief over
her face. The next thing she remem
bered was being In a train with "Gran

the merits of his novel have at last
dawned upon a generally ur.discerning
public." . HAYDEN CHURCH.
We, cordially join. .Mr. Ehrich in wishing that the
Democratic party will reach that high illumination and
exalted state of courage. Then.it would present a defi
nite issue on which the country could pass. It merely
.follows, the Republican party, either wholly adopting its
principles," dr. hiding in their shadow and making its
campaigns upon personalities, or on artifices which
mean nothing. All men admit that, there are two
definite, antithetical and exactly antagonistic economic
policies, protection and free trade. There is no middle
ground, no half-way house. If free . trade is ever to
prevail in this country it must be by a campaign made
openly, as Richard Cobden made his fight in England.
The attempt to make a sneak on the people will never
.succeed." If the country is to have protection,. it demands
it from the Republicans, the party of protection.
That part of the St. Louis platform will be awaited
with some interest, for' the people want to see how com
pletely the Democracy can put on a mask.
THERE is evidently a feeling that is not confined
to his immediate supporters that Mr. Hearst still
stands a chance for the St. Louis nomination.
There is a palpable falling off in the fervor for Parker,
His support in New York has weakened, and Bryan's
influence iti several Southern States has been strong
enough, to prevent the direct instructions that Parker's
friends expected. The other avowed candidates, except-
Hearst, have no prospect- of the convention,'
and at present the outlook seems to be Hearst or <a
dark horse. â¢
The convention will lack the presence of many of the
strong men of national' reputation who- were in .the
councils, of the party prior to 1896. The neocr^cy is
more" in evidence than the. element which led from the
close of the Civil War to the end of Mr. Cleveland's
last term. While it is claimed that the reorganizefs will
control the convention, there is no prospect that they
will be logical and .adopt the gold Democratic platform
of 1896, with such few changes as events make necessary.
Major Watterson is, the leading newspaper exponent of
reorganization,' but Kentucky turned him down, with
considerable violence. His position is illogical, since he
persists in repudiating Cleveland with a vigor that is
hardly second to the zeal of Mr. Bryan' in the same
work. He sees in Cleveland the same, qualities which he
imputes- to Roosevelt, and regards them both as danger
ous to; the republic.
Watterson is skilled in scenting danger to the' republic,
and if he be' a true prophet we are already deprived' of
most of our liberty, and Cleveland and Roosevelt are
about to strip us of the smaller xeroainder and put the
tatters and remnants up at auction in rag fair. He seems
to" have no choice for the Presidency, but is unusually
skillful' in proving that every other man's- choice is dy
namite in the cellar of the Temple of Liberty. If one
may judge by what he says he would support MayKDr
McClellan the most cheerf ally, in the belief that the
Goddess of Liberty might survive his nomination.
The platform is to be the matter of most interest in
the convention. The free traders recently held a con
venticle in New York to celebrate the birthday of
Richard Cobden. They rang the tocsin to call atten
tion to the surrender of the Democratic party, to protec
tion, and proceeded to devise ways and means 'to rescue
and put it in the line of free trade once more. The
notable address was delivered by Mr. Louis Ehr|ch of.
Colorado.. He denounced protection as "An insidious
scheme by which favored beneficiaries are . permitted to
pick the pockets of # the community while the Govern
ment holds the victim down and prevents rescue from
the outside." He mourned excessively because "A dis
tinguished citizen df New York who has lavished mill
ions in the purchase of art treasures is debarred from
importing them into our country because the Govern
ment -would fine him excessively for bringing' to the re
public what would be more precious to "us than all the
wealth of the Indies."
That distinguished citizen is Mr. J. Pierpont Mor
gan. If he is able to lavish millions on art in Europe,
common sense would say that he should be able to con
tribute to the revenues of his own country by paying the
tariff on his collections. It is evident that,. while Ihe St.
Louis convention, will pretend to commit the party to
protection, its denunciation of the Dingley tariff will
get all of its vigor from the sentiment of free trade. If
the party ever get the power to make a tariff, its con
ditions will' be dictated by the free traders. O â¢ .:
Mr.'Ehrich concluded his address with, this: "If" the
Democratic party had the manly courage that is born
of conviction, and the practical wisdom which flows
from ihe highest lessons of human experience, it would,
in its coming national convention, adopt one; single
plank'which would read: 'The Democratic party favors
the total and immediate abolition pi every tariff duty,
and the introduction of absolutely unrestricted freedom
of 'trade- with the nations of the world.'"

THE pioneers of the State of Washington have just
met at Seattle' and '.. celebrated the twenty-first an
niversary of the formation /of their association.
Last week the Fresno County pioneers held at Fresno
their first annual reunion. To be a member of thd
Fresno County organization it is necessary to have re
sided in Fresno County twenty years. There were sixty
pioneers of Fresno at banquet. The Washington pio
neers had several hundred members at their gathering. â¢ .
Among the Washington pioneers- are. the Rev. Myro'n .
Neels, who' first saw .Washington in 1848, and Mrs.
Nancy Bogart of Renton, who -settled, in Washington ' in
the same year. .Many influential persons belong to the
Washington: pioneer association^ The Fresno society
â¢includes the leading- people of the county.' Both bodies'
are, therefore, representative. - "."Â¦"".' - : .:
The two gatherings must suggest to the reflective the
wide divergence between the past and present and the
existence of two types of pioneers; in the veins of both
of which runs good American blood and in the brains of
whom are the American- characteristics of pluck, enter
prise and persistence. The pioneers of the State of
Washington, like the pioneers of California, came to a
new country. Theirs was the mission to founjl a new
commonwealth and to add to the Union ah imperial
State. They, began primitively, defending upon the nat
ural resources in gold and other products in which the"
Pacific slope abounded. Those who were not miners
were farmers or traders"' to a large degree. They ca"me"
to a land of possibilities of which they had little early
conception. Knowledge came slowly, ushering in": a
new era with deliberation. - ..
' Dreaming "the years away under, soft skies; the lands,
of the Mediterranean reveled in their centuries t>ld her
itage of vine-clad and fruit-dowered fields, jo then
dwellers the Pacific Coast of the United States seemed
as remote and its territory as much a terra incognita as
was the great Northwest when the poet -â¢ wrote his
sonorous line about "the wolf's long howl from. Oonoo-.
laska's shore." ' i?.^v " â¢ : . -
It fell to the lot'of the earliest pioneers of: the Pacific -
Coast to tell to the world that here they' had found -an
empire in extent and affluence. It was' the destiny oi the
later pioneers, those of Fresno County, whose member
ship needs to run back only twenty" years, for its gene-'
sis, and of their fellow workers in niany places,.. to pio
neer the way for new industries, that should - amaze
France, Spain and Ijaly, by planting greater vineyards
and more extensive orchards, competitive with foreign
lands. *â¢ â¢ . Â¦ "-- ,';-/â¢ . â¢ =
Which, type- of pioneer performs the- greater service
to mankindâ : tho one that dares all t6 .seek- gold, or a.
new home across deserts and mountain -ranges; or by",
voyaging over stormy seas and founds a' State, or the
one that, finding unpromising areas in. which all agricul
tural endeavor would seem to be experimental, Je.ads the
way to make 'arid acres- blossom as the. rose: and "scat
ters plenty o'er a smiling land"? The answer wiH prob
ably be that" f.heir labors are - complementary^-that one
follows the other as a -sequence and that the eyents- were
equally inherent in American character. . . â¢â¢
The men of Washington talked, at their reunion of
the days of '50 and '60; those of Fresno spoke of Â¦
what has been ''accomplished in a comparatively few
years'. A majority of the Fresno speakers were when
pioneers poor, willing to earn their living by any hon- â¢â¢
orable means at hand.- A present judge told how he'
had worked on a threshing machine. Another recalled i
that every one laughed in derision at the bold man who
ventured- to set out the first grape vines, forerunners of
the great vineyards" that have given Fresno the primacy
as a raisin center. â¢
Since 1883,' so it was set forth by one of the speakers,
the population of Fresno County has grown from gooo
to 45,000; its raisin production has risen from 500,000 i
pounds a year to 6,000.000 pounds; its wine annually!
amounts to 3,000,000 gallons and its brandy to i,ooo,ooot
gallons; it has become the home of the Smyrna fig; in
all directions it has advanced and, as claimed truly by
one speaker,; it has been: demonstrated that there is no
twenty mile square surface anywhere" that is. more pro-

None are above it and none are below it. The man, who
desires to use the streets on his way to or from his law

compelled to protect himself and does so, efficiently and
well, he deserves the support of the whole community.

â¢Yesterday was a busy day at the
Presidio. The .general muster of the
troops took place In the morning, im
mediately following which the troops
of the Third Infantry and the First
and Second battalions of the Tenth In
fantry were paid off. The Jingling of
coin was heard on every side.
At the quarters of the Ninth Cavalry
everything was in action getting things
into shape for *heir march to Henry
ranch, while In *he cantonment of the
Tenth Infantry great trucks were cart
ing away the effects and Implements
of war of that regiment preparatory to
its departure for the north this morn
ing.
The big guns l Fort Baker were
booming away iri great shape yester
day morning. The vibrations were
very distinctly felt all over the city
and some of the tall buildings trembled
perceptibly. It was almost impossible
to believe that the firing was not done
from this side of the bay.
COLONEL MORRIS IX COMMAND.
Colonel Charles Morris, commanding
the artillery district of San Francisco,
was in command. Captain L. It. â¢ Bur
gess, his adjutant, and Colonel Luigi
Lomla, in command at Fort Bajter, also
took part in the practice.
The four companies of the Thirteenth
Infantry that are practicing -at Rodeo
rifle range under command of Captain
William Black have so far won out
away ahead of other's who have been
on the range. They are so far credited
wltti eighty-nine marksmen. Twenty
five of these belong to Company M.
Captain Samuel L. Falson, "stationed
at Fort Mason.
Colonel Edward A. Godwin, Captain
General MacArthur, accompanied by
his aid. Major West, inspected the
Third â¢ Infantry, Colonel T. C. Wood
bury, yesterday morning. The troops
were drawn up in lines of masses on
the parade grounds in front of the
hospital to receive the commanding of
ficer as he stepped on the field prompt
ly at 9:30 a/ m.. .>.';â¢
The inspection was thorough. Fol
lowing the inspection the troops passed
in re'view, headed by their splendid
band, ' before the commanding officer.
The regiment was highly complimented
by General MacArthur.
: The troops looked very fresh and
snappy in new blue uniforms with
campaign hats and leggings. The of
ficers- were in service uniforms. A fact
of more than passing note was re
marked. ' Out of the fifty-one officers
belonging to the regiment, Vut two
were not with the command. This was
an unusual circumstance, as from
every regiment there are always from
ten .to twelve on detached duty. The
two detached officers are Captain Hor
ace M. Reeve, an attache to the United
States Embassy at City of Mexico,
and Captain Robert H. Noble, aid to
Civil Governor Wright in the Philip
pines. .
Following the review General Mac-
Arthur was presented to all the offi
cers of the regiment In front of the
line of officers' quarters belonging to
the model camp. The Introduction was
followed by general informal conversa
tion. â¢

Portland Browns Take Their Measure
in a Slow Exhibition. Â¦'.
PORTLAND, June SO.â Jake Thiel
man was In the box for the Browns up
to the fifth inning of to-day's game.
The pitcher's arm was lame and the
San Francisco men began to connect
too freely with his delivery in that inn
ing Roach was sent in to take his
place and finished th'e game.
The final score was 8 to 6, with the
larger figure for the home team. It
was a slow and rather â¢ uninteresting
exhibition." Phil Kadeau, the Brown's
crack outfielder, did a pretty piece of
work in the seventh inning. Anderson
sent one* out into Phil's territory that
looked good for two bases at least, but
the Brown fielder sprinted 'and sent the
ball to the plate In time to â¢ catch
Meany. Jones was on the Â¦ slab for .the
visitors. His delivery was no > puzzle
when hits meant runs, and the. victory
for the Browns was in a measure a
walk-over. The score:

Poor old Imperious, after traversing
a road strewn with roses and. thorns
during a long career on the turf, laid
down and ; died .after, starting In the
concluding, race here on 'the openfng
day. Early during the running the
veteran showed some speed, then fell
out of it. ; Soon after being taken back'
to his stable he died from a broken
blood vessel, the veterinary aald. -.:.
Imperious, when -owned by Dr.
Rowell. captured a Burns handicap
and later when useless on the flat was
placed at the jumping game: He was
raced here by Joe Kern, a â¢ Kansas
City turfman. . , .
Iva Powell, it is understood, has left

Frank McMahon and Danny Mc-
Carthy, owners of the Piedmont sta
ble, have pulled down two purses.
Vassalo, with Tullett up, earned a nose
decision over Nuptial, backed from
3 to 2 to evens. Two days earlier In
the week Joe Kelly, the sfable's rid
er, put Edna Sullivan, a two-year-old,'
over the l?late first at odds of 15 to 1.
It marked the graduation from the
maiden class of both horse and jock
ey. McMahon and his friends, includ
ing Pete Sullivan, were down hook,
line and sinker on Lou-Otstot. the
Strobel entry, at 6 to 5 to win this
latter race..-
J. Case's black horse, Possart, at
odds of. 5 to 1, romped away-from a
small freld over one And one.-slxteerith
miles -in 1:49 Vi. The performance Is
a clever one, as the track for runners
is but seven furlongs. â¢ . *
"Frisco" Hoag, who was on the sick
list at Kansas City, came here to re
cuperate. He started El Plloto In a
seven-furlong run, and with- anything
like an even break the gelding would
have galloped home. - Almost left, he
ran fourth and the Calif ornians
breathed light for a few days.
John Lodge's mare, Fair Lady An
na, which he " claimed from Charley
McCafferty at Oakland last winter,' is
doing well here and â¢ ought to win
shortly. She has a second and a third
to her credit.
The field was not a high class one.
but it was "the Darby" and that was
sufficient. The "ultra- fashionables of
society here ex(fulsltely gowned, a.nd
the elect of the.mal.e population dressed
strictly in accordance with the" latest
fashion plates, were present, some. In
automobiles', others in tally-hos,
breaks, landaus, runabouts, while the
balconies of the clubhouse of- the Coun
try CluJ> were a confused mass of
bright colors and pretty faces'.
Not only did California furnish the
winner of the. Derby but the "favorite,
as well. Eowena, purchased or leased
from Burns & Waterhouse by Ed Gay
lord e-f this city, and ridden by- O'Neil
had a decided call In the betting. The
filly found 117 pounds and one mile and
an eighth more than Bhe could negoti
ate. After leading for something- over
a mile, she was passed and easily
beaten by Keogh, the second choice in
the betting. The winner was piloted
by Ike Tullett. . Ike was shot to pieces
by the press photographers seated: in
the monster "floral horsesho*. which
Keogh refused to .have placed over his
head, and was altogether the real hero
of the occasion. . -. Y. Â¦
TWELVE [BOOKMAKERS CUT IX.
- Twelve bookmakers cut in the open
ing, day. This" number Is" more than
the play, warranted when the financial
situation is given consideration, and
there were three absentees at- the
next drawing. Â¦ Most of the books were
low, -but two or three good breaks
fattened up the bank rolls. - -
S The California colony here is -quite
an extensive one. Jimmy Lawler, the
ex-pugilist, who has branched out as
a bookie ever .Â«unce obtaining, a taste
of the garne on Butchers' day at Oak
land, is one of the leviathans.. Frank
Harris, An Oaklander, .is his " block
man -and George Crowley is cashing
â¢the winning " pasteboards. Sam Stine
and Zick Abrams-are booking under
the name of the Illinois Club and are
holding' their own. Next week they
count on laying something .away.
Sammy Peckerman, their cashier,
dropped a bundle or bills out of the
box on Saturday while, .figuring up
after the races and. taking no chances,
made a headlong dive for the money.
He escaped injury "and a -shy pot. At
the conclusion of the nieet here, .Stlne
will go to Chicago.. Zick has been
bothered with rheumatism and â¢ says
he and Mrs. Abrams will to to
Mount Clemens,- Mich., for a rest.
Bert and- "Will Ayers of Petaluxna, who
were the backers of tbfe Colma Club,
are also in .line. Ben Levy is taking
the money for them. From here they
journey to Chicago. Cooper,"the.Ta

"Westerner laying prices at' Overland.
Besides winning the Derby with
Keogh. Perry Hlldreth won a purse
with Edith Vice. The filly showed
some oldtlihe-'speed and with- Jimmy
Loague up ran away from her conif

DENVER, June 30.â Although" "hard

The second annual -tournament for
the. women's championship of the State
will also comt-ence to-day. The entry*
list Is small and the tournament* is not
attracting as much attention as It did;.
last year. Miss Miriajn Edwards,' the
champion, will play . the tournament
winner on Monday morning. Miss
Hazel Hotchkiss is expected to win

, -The drawing -for the men's event re
sulted as follows: .
The fourth annual tennis tournament
.for the championship of California will
commence -this morrUns on ttoe Hotei
Rafael cuurts.- The entire list, which
closed yesterday, was much larger than
'.was. expected and it Is the largest on
record. Thirty of the cleverest
from .various parts of the State will'
'participate andaome Wgh class tennis
should result. IV Is expected the final
match will be playÂ«d to-morrow after
noon and the challenge match on Mon
day afternoon. In this match Grant
Mki # Smith, the present champlop. "will,
play the winner of the tournament.
George F. "Whitney vrx>n the first two
events for the State cftampiQnshlp and :
Smith the third. As tne- cup-was put
up only two years ago .Whitney's name
.is on It but once. .Another victory for
Smith would give him a. substantial
lead In the race for the trophy.
Percy Murdock and Harry Wlehs
will not play. The Xonner is unable
.to leave his business, while the latter
has been advised by his physician not
t6 play, as he is threatened with en-<
largement of the heart.'
George Baker, the crack player from
Golden Gate Park.' entered at the last
moment and looms, up as- a possible
winner. Many consider that either
Baker or Drummond -MaqGavin will
win" the tournament. MacGavin tm
anxious to get a return match with
Murdock and-. was disappointed when
he learned the Alametla crack, could
not play. Tennis followers are ex
'tremely anxious to .see Mufdock and
Smith try conclusions and figured Ihey
would meet If" Murdock entered. .Mur
dOck. however, would have had no easy
time beating men" like' MacGavln and
Baker.- The latter btÂ»at him at Ala
tneda several months ago and is at- all
times a dangerous- opponent. MacGav
ln arid Smith will probably meet . on-
Monday, although many think Baker,
can beat the former. . "â¢"" *
.Unfortunately MacGavln and Baker
drew in the same ha}f. but will not '
'meet until the semi-final round. Frank
Mitchell appears to be" the best man
in ; the upper half. He will have* to dis
pose of such men as Herbert Long.
Clarence Griffin. Cari Gardner, Harry*
'Holfe and A. Brabant to reÂ«ch- the
finals. In the last tournament Long
beat Mitchell handily. Â¦ ' . â¢ . 1\
Smith, the champion, has not played
in a tournament. since last October land
has not had as much* practice as for-*
raerly. He Is nevertheless in 'good trim

CHILD IS MISSING.â OAKLAND, June SO.
â K. R. Kuybers, residing at 6tU8 Whitney
street, has reported to the police that his son.
li years old. wandered away from home Tues
day and la still missing. Kuybers thinks the
boy has been picked up by people who are
unable to Uarn where he lives.
Attorney Ach, at his own request,
was sworn. He testified that in a con
versation with Mitchell In the corri
dor of the Hall of Justice Mitchell had
told him he had received information
from Campbell that Judge La wlor had
admitted the books in evidence and it
was on this statement he surrendered
them.
Attorney Campbell next took the
stand and denied' flatly he had ever
said the books were already in evi
dence. All he had told Mitchell was
merely that no harm would come to
him, as everything would be returned
in good order. His statement was cor
roborated by Detective Gibson, who
was present when the conversation was
held.
Attorney Freldenrlch, who represents
the receiver, was not positive as to
what statement Mitchell had made to
him prior to the delivery of the books,
but was of the opinion that Mitchell
had told him in a conversation over
the telephone that a subpena had been
issued ordering him to produce the
books.
This concluded the taking of testi
mony and Attorney Ach made a formal
demand that the books be immediately
returned and that Campbell, Gibson,
Wadsworth and Mitchell be cited for
contempt of court.
In reply to this Campbell argued that
thare was no evidence to show that
the trustee could not see the books at
any time. So far as the possession was
concerned they were constructively , in
his possession so long as he had ac
cess to them, but had simply been re
moved from one place to another.
Referee Green then ruled, that he
had no righ.t'to certify the case up to
the Federal court as a contempt, in
asmuch as the fraud, if fraud existed,
was not committed before him. As to
the books, he Bald he would direct the
receiver to recover possession of them.
Frank S. Mitchell, formerly book
keeper for the Eppingers and now em
ployed by Receiver Wadsworth, was
first sworn. He testified that in com
pany with Detective Gibson he had
carried the books to the District At
torney's office and had deposited them,
on the floor of- the vault there; the un
derstanding being that hey were to be
accessible to him at any time. Mitchell
said that he gair\ed the impression
from a conversation w T ith Attorney
Campbell that the books had been ad
mitted In evidence before he gave them
"up, but -he was not positive Campbell
had made any such statement.
Upon examination- by Attorney
Campbell the witness said that to the
best of his recollection Campbell had
merely tc'.d him that he stood In no
danger by allowing the books to pass
temporarily from his immediate pos
session.
The proceedings before Milton J.
Green, referee in bankruptcy, while
brief, were interesting. Henry Ach,
representing Eppinser, sought to prove
that on June 23 Attorney Campbell
obtained possession of the books of the
firm by misrepresentation and there
fore was in cc-ntempt of the Federal
court. JThe testimony was very con
tradictory in its nature, but the prose
cution won out. '* â¢
This question was objected to, and in
reply Mr. Campbell said he would show
receipts were issued for more grain
than ever came .into the warehouse.
The witness when permitted to answer
said that he did not know. * Â¦-Â¦Â¦-_
At the onenlng of the morning ses
sion yesterday W. W. Topping was re
called to the stand and resumed the
leading of the entries in the books. It
vas explained that the great discrep
ancies were due to the swelling of
grain, which made a natural increase
during the year of some thousands of
bushels, and that the sums were sim
ply added to the books to make the
accounts balance. It was, his common
practice, he said, to balance the ac
counts at the end of each wheat sea
son bv making an allowance for in
crease during the year, his information
being obtained from daily warehouse
reports.
"Did the gains include barley as well
as wheat?" was asked.
"Yes."
"How many sacks were entered as
gains in barley?"
"Two hundred and -twenty-four thou
sand eight hundred and twelve sacks."
"Upon what amount is this entered
on the book as a gain?"
"It represents the season's gain for
the house."
"What was your grader Account to
force a balance of the books?"
"On 29,000 tons there was allowed a
gain of 10,000."
"How would it -stand deducting the
10,000 tons?"
"There were 6038 more tons delivered
than were received."
"Were warehouse receipts issued for
every pound of grain, including the
gain?" ,'->.
The legal battle for possession of the
books o* Eppinger & Co. before- Milton
J. Green, .referee in bankruptcy;' the
attempt of the defense to have the at
torney for the prosecution and others
cited for' : contemDt of court,- and the
demonstration that the books of the de
funct grain firm had been falsified to
make balances, were the features in the
proceedings against Jacob Eppinger
3 esterday.
It was shown that the grader used at
the Crockett warehouse must be 'a
wonderful machine. During, one year
the wheat that passed through' it
swelled to the extent of some 10,000
tons. The books also showed that more
grain had been delivered from the
Crockett warehouse during the year in
which the firm failed than had been re
ceived.

The Chief Justice has merely said what was
thought by everybody of sane and unprejudiced
mind. It is <mphatlcally and undeniably true
that the arbitration court is the expression
of an unwarrantable interference with the
liberty of the subject. It is emphatically true
that the establishment of this court haa en
couraged lltlglousness, and that matters which
might have been easily settled by the parties
in the course of a few minutes' conversation
are now hung up until the court haa time to
Seal with them. It is emphatically and un
dÂ«nlably lruÂ« that the arbitration court has. '
by its very existence, created and fostered bad
feeling between employers .and employes. It
was supposed to bring peace 1nto.thÂ« troubled
industrial- sphere; instead it has brought war.
and, worse, a constant sense of the necessity
for the preparation for war.
Meanwhile, the utterance of the Chief Jus
tice, however it may be attacked by the poli
ticians, represents the sober- judgment of the
community, a:Â»d if lookers-on see most of the
game, it is also that of the old-world observers
of our experiments. The misfortune is that for
the. time being we are powerless. In the grip
of this merciless legislation that grind? the
Krpat and small interests of tha people. Thero
is .'v consolation. The process is an education.
Grant onco said in America that he knew
no method of reform so effectual as> the rigid
enforcement of. a bad law.' That is the ex
perience of the state just now. and if by 1908
our industries arÂ« not transferred to other
states or helplessly crippled, we shall welcome

comltant 111 feeling and ill will. The appeal
was dismissed with costs.
The Herald thus comments on the
decision:
Ab was naturally to bÂ« expected, the opinion
of the Cblef Justice as to the mischievous
tendencies of the arbitration act has excited
strong adverse criticism from people who ap
prove of the legislation which has mad-e these
results more . than a possibility. Caucus rep
resentatives, who assume much on the ground
that they are also elected representatives of
th* people, epeak In a high tone about the
rights of the people, and even go so far as
to eay that the Chief Justice, in pointing out
the evils which have resulted from the estab
lishment .of the arbitration court, has been
guilty of some act which- is perilously near
high treason. Wo are not concerned to de
fend the utterance, of the Chief Justice on this
point. It requires no apologv. It stands In
need of no defense. It Js ths crystallized
opinion of every sensible man and woman in
the state. ..:".â¢

while visiting his mother he struck her ,
four, times on the face, knocked a baby ,
out of her arms and swore he would
not let her alpne until he killed her. <
The defence was that the accidental !

550 -for selling liquor without a Jicense
at. Twenty- third and Noe streets, and
sentenced James Fltzpatrick and Jo
seph" Stone to sixty days' Imprisonment
for stealing calico" from a Stockton
street dry goods store.
S. Ito was exploding giant bombs and
dancing gleefully after each explosion
when a policeman arrested him Thurs
day afternoon at Sacramento and Du
pont streets. When the case was called
in Judge Mogan's court this missive
Â¦was handed to the bench:
"Much Esteemed ' Judge of Police
Court: Business engages the unworthy
myself and respectfully pray you bail
510 be kept. My country save her cas
tles and in joyful gladfulness Japanese
men feel happy in this honorable na
tion. Difference is Fourth of Great July
firecrackers."
' Clerk Grey and Bailiffs Hlckey and
Maloney unanimously agreed that Mr.
Ito's note was. Intended to convey the
explanation that It was not In honor of
this nation's, natal day, but In celebra
tion of- a Slav defeat at the hands of
his compatriots, that he burned pow
der. So the ball of Mr. .Ito was ac
cordingly forfeited.
""Dr." Samuel Waits, the negro chir
opodist, palmist, phrenologist and nec
remancer-in-general of the Assembly
Club, -informed Judge Mogan for the
sixth time within two weeks that he
would restore .to a ' French governess
the 510 he obtained from her by repre
senting that he had dreamed the result
of a- future horse race and that her In
vestment would surely bring him 5300,
half of which he would give to her.
"Thhj procrastination is wearisome,"
said the Judge, "and if you fail to have
the 510 here to-morrow I'll give you the
limit for. obtaining money by false pre
tense."
' "Resthrain yo* han* till ter-morrah,
Jedge," said the "doctor," with great
earnestness, "an" yo'll sholy fine de

"It's either 510 to-morrow or you to

the Judicial ultimatum. ..
For stabbing. Charles Enzo with ap

had a perfect right to take his life. \ â¢ '
Miss Kittie Welch was the only femi
nine member of the group of twenty
three arrested Wednesday- night in John
Duffy's opium den, at Third and Bry
ant streets. The. entire lot were dis
missed by Judge Fritz, as the police
could not swear that Duffy either sold
or gave away opium or that the other
defendants smoked it, although the
place fairly reeked of fumes of the
drug.
Of the' five persons captured in Mike
Egari's "hop Joint," at 831 Sacramento
street. Minnie Hall. was the only wom
an. The. plea of the defense was that
the party was celebrating Miss Hall's
birthday when the blue-coated brigade
burst the door and. interrupted the fes
tivities, judge Mugan continued the
case till to-morrow. The invaders found
opium smoking paraphernalia and were
almost smothered by the fumes of
cooked poppy juice, but they did not see
the drug bartered nor did they catch any
of the'inmates in the act of "hitting the
.pipe;" bo it looks like another dismissal.
Al ' Jasperson, who would have mur
dered his divorced wife, Mrs. Maggie
Panhorst of 6 Hunt street, if his re
volver had been in good working order,
was sentenced to six months' imprison
ment by Judge Conlan.
Giovanni Kossaditovatski and his
name were hurled down a cellar stair
way at Pacific and Kearny streets by
Oscar F; Kelly, tall and sturdy, a cav
alryman, who was displaying his
physical strength to an admiring
throng. In defense of his conduct the
big soldier said he was making a fare
well tour of the Barbary Coast prior
to his departure for the East and
drank away his senses. Judge Mogan
will sentence him to-day.
For striking KaÂ«e Winn, a house
maid, on .the mouth, Albert W. Hohn

sisted that he first- send in his name
he struck her and ran away and eos:

"You may thank your stars," said
Clerk Rice' to the defendant, ''that
your crime was not committed on Fri
day or the 13th of the month, else you
would now be going up' for a year."
Martin Oakes deliberately flew in
the face, of popular superstition by
stealing. $13 from John Plath, and
Judge Conlan rebuked' his temerity by
sentencing him -to eight months' im
prisonment.

Of a recent important case the Syd

port:
The BrlckmMters' and Brickearters' Dis
pute. â The appeal by the Bridrmasters' and
Â¦Pipe Manufacturers' Union' of -Employers
against the decision c.f the arbitration court,
settling certain Issuer; for determination in
regard to the o'aims submitted by the Brick

in' the Banco Coc.rt yesterday. The full court,
after hearing Sir Julian Salomons. K. C., and-

The federal capital site question has
been under discussion in Australia's
Parliament for some time, but has been
laid aside for the time. Some weeks,
must elapse before it Is again taken up,
but it is already apparent that the final
struggle may be between Lyndhurst
and Dalgrety. Sir William Lyne is still
hopeful that Tumut will be selected,
and he will have the assistance of Mr.
Watson in pressing its claims, but
members anticipate that the other two
sites mentioned will receive the most
support in the House of Representa
tives. Bombala was chosen by the Sen
ate. ODinion in that chamber is, how
ever, veering round to Dalgety, which
is -only forty miles away from Bombala.
The New South Wales Government has
already undertaken not to alienate any
more land in the vicinity of the most
popular areas, but Dalgety has only re
cently been regarded as a possible
choice. Austin Chapman, who repre
sents the Dalgety as well as the Bom
bala district, has Written to the Min
ffcter for Home Affairs asking him to
request the New South Wales Ministry
to reserve the crown lands near Dal
gety for the present, and Mr. Batchelor
has agreed to do this.
The first General Conference of the
United Methodist Church of Australa
sia began its sittings recently in Syd
ney. After a welcome to the delegates
In the Athenaeum Hall an adjournment
was made to " the Wesley Church.
Though the proceedings were largely of
a strictly business nature the general
public, on invitation, attended in large
numbers and manifested much interest
in the doings of the delegates. The Rev.
Dr. Fitchett was elected president for
a term of three years, his majority be
ing very large. The Rev. W. Williams
was elected secretary for the same pe
riod. The retiring president, the Rev.
Dr. Lane, delivered an address, the
main feature of which was an advocacy
of the more adequate training of min
isters In order that in these days of
criticism and research they might be
able to "stand In' the watch tower of
the citadel and defend the faith."
1XFL.UKXCE OP CHURCH.
Some idea of, the widespread iniluence
in Australasia of the Methodist church
may be gained from the' strik
ing statement made at the Athe
naeum by' the president of the
General Conference, now in session (the
Rev. Dr. Lane), in speaking, of the dia.
tant places whence its delegates had
come. "We have come from afar," he
said, "from places as far north as
Rockhampton, in Queensland, and as
far south as Dunedin, in New Zealand;
from Grafton, on the eastern seaboard,
and from Perth, on the western."
The notice calling for tenders for the
conveyance of certain inland mails in
Western Australia has as one of its
conditions that white labor only must
be employed in the conveyance of such
mails, and t this notwithstanding the
Government has already stated that
the employment of aborigines in cer
tain portions of the Commonwealth
will not be objected to.
An officer of the Agricultural Depart
ment of West Australia has found in
Brazil a parasite for the fruit fly which
played such havoc in orchards and
gardens during the last three seasons.
A commission has been appointed in
West Australia to inquire into the im

The Sydney and Suburban Master
Bakers' Association has resolved to

The present State Parliament of New
South Wales, which expires by effiux

Mr. Pendergrast, true real leader of the
Labor party, was returned for North
Melbourne.
The baneful tendency of younger
members of the rural population to
pitch tents toward the cities is as
prevalent in Australia as in older
countries. If not more so in proportion,
as the following from the Sydney Her
ald well shows:
"The secretary of a public institu
tion in Melbourne was lately instruct
ed to advertise for a ground care-taker
at 3f>s per week. The applications for
this splendid position numbered 1475,
and the secretary and his staff had to
go back to the office at night and work
overtime In preparing the mass of mat
ter for consideration by the ruling
body, which was to make the appoint
ment. The Incident painfully illus
trates the deplorable condition of the
light labor market In Australian cities,
and reveals a most anomalous position
of affairs. We have a half-developed
and, to a large extent, unoccupied ter
ritory clamoring for livestock and the
plowshare, and all who have studied
the case are urging that Australia
inquires immigrants to go into the
country and give the land a chance to
do its duty to the state. At the Bame
time 1475 men in one city are anxious
to secure a billet at 35s per week.
We may be sure that a world of pa
thetic misery lies behind many of those
applications; that the 35s a week
would mean to a large proportion res
cue from respectable poverty and to
others relief from semi-starvation. Can
it be possible ihat while the cities are
crowded with Avorkless people men
must be brought to Australia to work
the land and. produce its fullness? The
question is growing bigger every day,
but no man has so far hit upon a sat
isfactory way of shifting the shiftless
from the city to the land and making
them useful to themselves and their
country.
"Apparently a large proportion of
the. population will drift into the cities,
and'once there they become the merest
tools of circumstances. For this sad
state of affairs the accepted explana
tion is that the city life is most at
tractive, and we are told that young
men* and women would rather exist
amid the excitements of -a- metropolis
at halt wages than work In the country
and make homes for themselves."

A test reading is not a life, reading; when

more substantial aid and advice; this is Just
what Prof." Livingstone gives you when you call
on him for a first-class clairvoyant reading. -
He asks you no questions, but tells you what

will succeed, to be relieved of the matters
that are troubling you, and of the schemes of

NEW YORK, June' 29.â "The women
of the "East should have physical, cul
ture departments ln ( their cluba. They
promote, harmonious feeling .among
club women. The physical culture de
partment has a tendency to stop, scrap
ping among club women."
So opoke, Mrs. George Law Smith,
president .of the California State Fed
eration of Women's Clubs, to-day.
"You know," Mrs. Smith, resumed,
"the women you stand up with- in the
ring and spar with, or play with. We
are very proud that we are the pioneer
women's club to have a physical- cuL
ture department. Eastern club, women
would do well to .copy our California
methods. It Is marvelous to see how
well preserved our club women are. It
is nothing to see largely built California
women 60 years old do a somersault
and as nimble as a child. Many of our
club women say they owe .their very
lives to the physical culture -depart
ment. Many of our women have only
learned to walk correctly since Joining
a club. We claim this department
makes healthy bodies and- healthv
brains. It Is simply development, arrd
insures renewed vitality."

: SANTA- ROSA,. June 30.â The ses
sions of the seventeenth annual fcon-,
vention of the California Christian En
deavor Union are proving interesting to'
the large number of delegates and vis
itars who are in attendance. The trains
which arrived Wednesday evening
brought large, crowds, but many addi
tions were made to the ranks of the
delegates by the trains from north' .and
south to-day. The bright badges .of the
Endeavorers are everywhere in evi
dence and -th'e streets of Santa liosa
present an active, appearance from
early mowiing to late at night.
One of the most interesting gather-
Ings of the convention was h'eld to
night at the First Presbyterian Church
after the close of the regular session of
the convention at the Athenaeum. It
was the session of the Veterans' Asso
ciation, composed of - those members
wJio have seen ten years of active ser
vice in the Endeavor ranks. Rev. Ed
win U. Hays, president of the Veter
ans' Association, was in the chair.
Those Â¦ present reconsecrated them
selves and their efforts to the work un
dertaken by the Christian Endeavor.
Praise services were held at the
evening' trains by a trained chorus, and
the delegates arriving were "received
with gladsome song. It proved a de
lightful innovation.
Denominational rallies were held this
afternoon in all of the Â¦ ' Protestant
churches. There alÂ»o was* a "personal
workers' conference, led by " Rev.
DwightE. Potter of Oakland.
Santa Barbara has entered the race
with Ukiah, Mendqcino County, for the
privilege of entertaining the next an
nual convention of the union. This
afternoon two telegrams were read to
the assembled Endeavorers Inviting the
convention to Santa Barbara in 190a.

The fruit market had an easier tone yester
day, as there was very little doing in the ship
ping line and receipts, while rather light, were
more than sufficient for local wants. Green
Bartlett Pears appeared from the river "and
sold at $1 5Og2 per box. About 50 boxes came
In. Apricots, Plums and Prunes In small ship
ping packages were easier, while choice
Peaches and good Apples were reported steady,
with supplies rather lltrht. The canners were
offering Â¦ from $20 to $38 per ton for Apricots
as to size and color, but were unable to pro
cure them, as the regular trade - was pur
chasing freely at the quoted rates. Loose
Black Cherries were ' In limited supply and
firm at higher rates, while Royal Anne were
plentiful and lower. - Packed stock of both de
scriptions was very dull owing to the lack of
demand for shipping, and prices ranged lower.
Currants continued to advance and occasional
sales of the large Cherry variety were re
ported at 75c per drawer. Figs continued
abundant and weak and quite a- surplus bad
to be carried over. Melons were In good re
quest at unchanged rates and Citrus and
Tropical fruits had but slight quotable vari

CHICAGO. June 30. â More favorable har
vesting weather in the Southwest took the edge
of! the wheat market at the start. Notwith
standing- an Improved tone in foreign grain
markets, sentiment in the pit here was quite
bearish. The opening on September was a
shade lower to VÂ»e higher at Sl}i@81!ie to
81%c. In the absence of outside epÂ«culative
Interest, local traders sold freely and at one
time it looked as If a bad break would fol
low. The principal feature of trading was
th$ ifiVJidstion of July holdings and the chang.
ing from July to distant deliveries. There
was also considerable Belling of September on
the improved weather conditions in the South
west, liefore the decline was checked Septem
ber went off to 80%c. During the latter part
of the session a decided reaction developed.
Bullieh advices regarding the spring wheat crop
were received from the Northwest, | the report*
statins: that abnormally cool weather was
preatly retarding the growth of the plant.
These rumors were accompanied by enough buy
ing orders to occasion a good rally, especially
in the more distant delivery. The market was
further etrenrthencd Â¦ within the last few min
utes of trailing by reports of rain in Kansas.
September closed at 81V4@Sl%c.
Liquidation of July holdings was the fea
ture of trading In the corn pit. : September
opened a shade lower to a shade higher at
4S%c to 4S%c, sold between 48?Â»Â®lS%c and
4$%c and closed at 4S%c.
.The oats market felt the effects of the easier
tone of- corn, prices of all deliveries showing
slight losses. September opened a shade higher
at :i2%c. sold between 31%@32c and 32^Â®>3^V4c
and closed at 32c.
In spite of considerable liquidation, the pro
visions market ruled firm and finished the day
with fair advances for all products. The chief
feature was buying of lard and ribs by com
mission houses, supposed to be for the account
of local packers. Higher prices at the yards
were a supporting influence. At the clcse Sep
tember pork was 2Cc higher; lard showed a
gain of "^itftlOc and ribs were up 12Vic.

Ngan Ping at 24" Baker alley, will be
rescued from her fate if the efforts of
Carrie G. Davis succeed. Mrs. Davis,
who is superintendent of the Oriental
Bureau of the Woman's Home Mis

church, yesterday applied to the Su
perior Court for letters of guardian
ship and custody of the child. In the
petition she alleges that Ngan Ping is
believed to be a member of the high
binder class and has no respect for
the law. Should the Chinese woman
learn of the proceedings it is stated
she would refuse to obey the order of
the court and would hide the child.
Judge Troutt ordered the Chinese
girl Into the temporary custody of
Mrs. Davis and set July 7 as the date
for hearing the matter of guardian

Holliday, the motorman, took in the
whole situation. The busy individual
was not paying much attention to him.
Holliday's hands were as' near the roof
as they could get. He realized that the
thug- was nervous, and the motorman
did not want to be a cause for a pull
of the trigger. As soon as the money
was passed' out the man and his re
volvers backed through the rear door
and disappeared into the park.
Both the street car men say that the
highwayman was small, had his face
blackened, wore a handkerchief over
the lower Dortion of his features and
had on a dark suit and a derby hat.
They admit that the two revolvers
seemed to be larger than the man and
that as they gazed along the muzzles
death seemed to- be gaping from their
openings.
As quickly as the grip could be picked
up the car was headed cityward and
the police were warned. Holliday's de
scription of the robber has caused the
police to bel.ieve that the thug is a
novice. They at once began a search
of the park, but up to a late hour the
footpad had not been found.
Suddenly the rear platform was
jarred by the weight of a man and the
startling cry rang out, '-'Throw up your
hands."
Conductors of street cars are accus
tomed to reaching up, but St. Ledger
reached higher than he ever did be
fore. Suspecting that some trick was
being played on him, St. Ledger started
to joke the Intruder, but the language
which met his attempt at hilarity was
such that he grasped the atmosphere
higher, than .before. His reason for do
ing that was the display of two mur
derous" looking revolvers in the hands
of the man who was giving the orders.
All 6t. Ledger could see was the min
iature cannon close to his vest buttons.
.His hearing was not impaired. He dis
tinctly, heard the man behind ' the gun
say "dig up." He dug. Reaching into
.his side pocket St. Ledger pulled loose
change to the amount of $6 and slid it
along the seat of the car. The man be
hind the guns was very anxious to get
away, for he failed to take all the
money- the conductor placed at his dis
posal.
MOTORMAN WATCHES.
Several times during the evening con
ductors and motormen noticed a figure
skulking along the wall at the Hayes
street entrance to the park, but in each
instance there were passengers on
board the cars and the robber retreated.
When car 210, in charge of Conductor
H. St. Ledger and Motorman George E.
Holliday' arrived- 'at the terminus no
passengers were aboard. St. Ledger
was sitting inside the car ready to eat
his lunch, while Holliday sat on the
opposite side of the car waiting for the
time to return -to the city.
ROBBER APPEARS.
A small man with two large revolvers
held up car 210 of the Hayes street line
at 9:40 d'clock last night near the park
and secured about $6. He was "very
nervous, otherwise he would have got
$40 more from Conductor Harry H. St.
Ledger, for the man in charge of the
car. had that much, more money on his
person. .;; ' : .\ r ;

Good Description of Him
Mrs. Green says she discovered that
Mrs. Francis never deposited any of
the payments in the Western National.
On June 20 Mrs. Green contracted to
sell the lease of the rooming-house and
her furniture therein to Mrs. Mar
chant and went to Madison & Burke's
to have the lease transferred. To her
surprise the real estate men told her
that the property was no longer in her
name; that Mrs. Francis had present
ed a bill of sale for it and claimed pos
session. The bill of sale represented
that the transfer had been made for a
consideration of $10. Mrs. Green de
clares she never signed such a docu
ment knowingly.
Then, to cap the climax, the gas and
electric company cut off the gaslight
and reported that the action was under
the orders of Mrs. Francis.
Mrs. Green says that Mrs. Francis
threatens to take possession of the
property and being a "violent and law
less woman" will carry out her threat
unless restrained by the court. Hence
the plaintiffs apply for an injunction,
for an accounting, and for $500 dam
ages each. Mrs. Green offers to pay
the $10 10 principal with the interest
still due upon the loan.
It is further alleged that, as a part of
the . transaction, Mrs. Green agreed to
pay $12 50 a month to Mrs. Francis.
The latter was to take out the interest
due and deposit the balance to Mrs.
Green's account in the Western Nation
al bank, as a "redemption fund" for
the principal. It is charged that in
stead of giving the $150 required, Mrs.
Francis only paid $135 50 to Mrs. Green,
holding out $14 50 "for expenses."
DISPUTES Â¦ BILL OF SALE.
On February 4 last, according to the
complaint, Mrs.- Green needed money
and to get it she negotiated a loan with
Louise J. Francis, who is engaged with
her husband in lending money for
for usury. Mrs. Green says that she
was to. have $150 for six months with
the right of asking for $50 more, j The
lean was to be secured by a promissory
note, and on the date named a docu
ment was presented to her to sign, but
she was not permitted to read it, Mrs.
Francis saying that it was the usual
thing for borrowers to sign. Being in
ignorance of such proceedings, Mrs.
Green signed and paid the notary the
costs. The notary, by the way, was
.also a woman, Addie L. Ballou, who
appears in the directory as a notary
and portrait artist with offices in the
Donohoe building.
WOMAN AS MONEY LENDER.
Woman's inhumanity to woman is
the keynpte of a complaint filed yester
day in the Superior Court. An interest
ing story is told of alleged, usury and
fraud on one side and ignorance of the
world's ways on the other, yet, accord
ing to the - plaintiffs, only the sum of
$10 10 stands between the litigants." The
suit is brought by Phoebe A. Green and
I,illie Marie Marchant against Louise J.
Francis, Madison & Burke, Jane Doe.
Allyneand the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Light Company.
From the complaint it appears that
Mrs. Marchant is the mother of two
children and her support and theirs
is dependent wholly Upon the boarding
house which figures in the case. The
lease of this house and the furniture
therein, it is averred, were owned by
Phoebe Green, who paid the rent up to
June 30 to Mrs. Allyne, the owner of
the house. Â» â¢ .
