ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 11.â The Czar has declared for war upon the Four hundred thousand Gbssacks will be mobilized to crush out
the rebellion against the throne. Unless the revolutionists triumph in the ensuing struggle they will lose all that they have gained, for the Government having

Rules. '
Faculty Committees
Decide to Abandon
Old Style.
Will Be Governed No Longer
by the Select Body of
Eastern Men. ,
It is prob'ab'.c that the great annual
football game between Stanford Uni
versity and the University of California
will i:ever be played again in the way
i-.nd under the rules tliat the grilling
contents of the last twelve years have
been fought. Rugby, the ancient game
j'iayed by the si^liogJs of England to-
Oay, seems destined to take its place.
Yesterday afternoon the faculty ath
letic committee of the two universities j

ihiÂ» city and adopted a resolution de
crying- the evils of the present system
*>f football playing in America. It !
recommtnded that the Rugby game be
introduced as a substitute.
In the same resolution this commit
tee recommends that intercollegiate
football contests shaM no longer be
held under the direction of the present !
rules committee, which sits in the East
<ach year and revises the methods of
playing the college game. This means
an absolute break with this committee,
which has governed the game for many
years, and the naming of a Western
rules committee, which shall have full
power to act. Such a break will cause
consternation iin the East, where the
word of the rules committee has been
law for so long. It means the revolu
tionizing of the game on the Pacific
Coast, or, -what seems more likely from
the tone of the resolution, the aban- ,
donment of tf'e present game and the !
Introduction of Ragby.
.\u25a0 XAMES ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
The faculty committee also appointed
a committee of students and graduates
from the two universities and'Coaeh
William Reid of Harvard University to
confer with it ard aid it iv a tinal de
cision of what thai, be done in regard
to the future of football on the Coast. I
These students and graduates are !
James F. Lanagan. Stanford coach; Dr.
Frank Simpson, an old California play
er; Dr. A. B. Bpaulding, former Stan
lord coach; Prcntiss Gray, guard on
California's 3905 team; James A. Force,
< aptain California's 1905 team; A. J.
Chalmers, captain Stanford's 1903 team;
SI. P. Stott, captain-elect Stanford's
team; Hoy Elliott, captain-elect Cali
fornia's team.
There was not a unanimity of feel
ing among the faculty over the pro
posed substitution of Rugby football
for the present game. Some of the
leading men from both Stanford nd
California felt that the present game
was the best. All agreed that some
means of leesening the danger of the
g-amÂ© should be adopted. They all
agreed that football should not be
'played in preparatory schools. The
faculty members present were Dr.
David Starr Jordan. ' Dr. William P.
Snow and Dr. Frank Angell from
Stanford; President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, Colonel George C. Edwards
and Professor H. B. Torrey from the
University of California.
The resolution adopted Is as follows:
"Resolved, by the joint faculty athletic
committee of the University of California
and Leland Stanford Junior University,
That we recommend to the faculties of the
two universities in question that the In
tercollegiate football contest shall no
longer be held under the regulations of
the present football rules committee. We
rrcomraend as a substitute the present
English Rugby game, or else the present
American game, with such modiflcations
as shall promise to eliminate the present
existing evxis."
IVO OAXGER IX RUGBY.
The Rugby game is not at all like- the
American game. In it macs formations
end interference work, where most of tbe
accidents happen, are not allowed. In
stead of being a game with a team acting
as one man. it is a game of individuals.
Tbe ball is kicked on*. The player who
I receive* it can run with it or kick It back.
lie runs until he is tackled, not below the
\u25a0waist, after the style of the hard-smash
ing tackles of America, but about the
waist. When he sees that he can go no
farther he cries 'Held,' and the others let
po. The ball is then given to the txroplre,
who throws it among the forwards, who
. may cither run with it or heel it back to
â the halfbacks behind them. When a man
/runs with the' ball' nls team mates must
V'.r-ep behind him all the time. Goals and
are much the Â«ame as in the
American game. The roughness of play
Is eliminated by the absence of mass play
Rnfl interference. It will take the Ameri
can public a long time to- become used
to seeing individual work instead of the

which caused hlin to endhis life while In
fear of insanity and paralysis that would
cause his fingers to become npwerless.
Frank's father, Ferdinand, / with whom
he lived on East Eighty-eighth street. Is
a musician of some fame. The elder
Frank's genius is shared by his : other j

BERKELEY, December 11.â The
controversy over the Postma-stership of
Berkeley, which has lasted for ten
months and involved a United States
Cabinet officer, a State Governor and
Innumerable minor politicians,, ended
to-day when F. W. Richardson made a
public announcement in his newspaper
admitting: his defeat by George 1
Schmidt, the present Postmaster.
Schmidt's name is to be submitted
to President Roosevelt by Congress
man Joseph R. s Knowland on Decem-.
ber 16, and no opposition to the ap
pointment is anticipated. Richardson
has written to the Congressman ask
ing that his name be withdrawn and
that the opposition to Schmidt, as far
as he is concerned, be considered at an
end. , '. . ' /\u25a0 > -.. "-. \u25a0\u25a0 , \u25a0â¢ '..'. \u25a0"-

W. Richardson admits -to-day that; he
was defeated by Secretary. Metcalf be
cause of, his alliance with Governor
Pardee's supporters, his- stateme'nt .re
garding this phase of the matter be
ing as follows: \u25a0
The truth Of this matter is that the Poet
mastership light was a 'fight between big poli
ticians. X never dreamed that It would take
in \u25a0 Secretary lletcalf.. or' I wouldn't have be
gun It. I reasoned that Metcalf was too bis
a man and occupied too Important a position in
tbe- a:falrs of the nation to - interfere In so
small a matter. J . knew he had cause to sup
port rather than oppose me, and hence thought
he certainly would not" mix 'in the matter. I
was mistaken, as were many of his friends and
mine. â¢ . \u25a0
I knew the patrons tÂ« belonged' to Congress
man Knowland. and , of. course thought;, he
would dispose of. It- as he pleased.' .
I ha\Â» lto.cn informed that Metcalf. has in
sisted that I shou^not^be appointed because
I am a Pardee nui.^ I supported both Pardfe
and M.'t.calf in the cainpaKin three years ago,
but I iiave not be*n Identified with any fac
tion during my nearly .five years' residence in
Berkeley, as my. Republicanism is built, on
stronger and flrtner .lines.. , In justice to Gov
ernor Pardee 1 will say that while he has al
ways treated me with courtesy, and consider
ation, and is my friend, I did not ask him to
take- any part in- this, -little.' contest, and. he
absolutely had no Dart in it. - - : .
.An investigation of the supporters of Schmidt
and myself in this flint will show that the
many local admirers of. our splendid. Governor
have been badly mixed, soipe standing for me
and otliers for Schmidt.
I had an interview with Knowland Just be
fore his -departure for Washington, and he
promised to make one More effort to get Met
calf to withdraw, his; request. On ; his arrival
in Washington -be â¢ found > Metcalf ' as firm Â» as
ever, and rather than have a breach with the
Secretary, he will hand Schmidt's name to: the
President. "* . - â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0 -."
I firmly believ* that Congressman Knowland
'was desirous of recommending me, and would
have done so had he not feared such action on
his part would have ' caused a breach | between,
himself and ! Metcalf. and -, that : rather 2 - than
cause *uch a ' breach he â¢ complied ; with I Met-;
calf's demand, even thoush It .was against his
own wishes and his interests.- - â¢ \u25a0{\u25a0 :, â¢
â¢ I have no regrets whatever. ; I have enjoyed
the fight while it lasted. I had all the trump
cards, but Schmidt I held ' the Joker. '.The Joker
was in the deck by mistake and I now -fully
appreciate the Joke and nho Joker. '. -,
â¢ I - have been able to hold the matter up for
ten months. > \u25a0 and - could probably hold it stlU
longer but I feel that It is better to have it de
cided before tbe end of the year and made that

that ' the .Government J has ! ! entered*:upon

and revolution confront one another in
a death-struggle. 'Both General Trepoff
and General: Count Ignatieff,: acording
to the: popular impression, are being
held in reserve- to execute the pro
gramme of repression.'.^
It \u25a0 isi said' that -the i entire Cossack
strength of 400,000 will be mobilized in
a supreme effort' to 'crush, the revolu
tionary force. 1 General Parsenoff said:
"I think v/e are' coming to rivers of
blood in which the revolutionary/ party
will lose their game and Russia her lib
erty."
Certainly the appearance of St.
Petersburg and the events here to-day
seem to justify this black picture'of the
future. The capital .resembles a great
military camp. The patrols everywhere
were doubled. to-day and grim-looking
cannon rrumbled though the streets.
What occurred smacked strangely of
the old regime. .A large workmen's
meeting was. dispersed by; Cossacks.
The building in which , the . executive
committee of the League of Leagues
meets was surrounded , 'by ;troops ;ahd
no. one was permitted to enter it. The
colonel in command replied to all ; , In
quiries, "I have my orders." At the
same time a. vast meeting of '.'loyalists"
was freely permitted, at which speeches
were made extolling the Emperor] and
the Government. . .-.. ;
To cap .the climax the . funeral of
Lieutenant General. Sakharoff, former
I Minister of War (who was assassinated
at Saratoff on December 5), with an im
posing: array of military,, representing
1 all arms of the serviceâ artillery, horse
guards and foot soldiersâ passed up the

pany. Scott testified that Hadley
never repaid those loans and that the
insurance company realized only
$30,000 on the sale of the collateral.

IN THE SENATE
Tillman Introduces Rail
road Rate Bill; Which
Leads to Much Oratory
FOKAKEU OX WARPATH
Hints That **Some Person"
â¢Fell Short of His Diity
in Santa Fe Rebate Case
WASHINGTON. Dec. 11. â With spir
fted debates on the subject of railroad
legislation, arising through the intro
dactlon of a bill by TiJlman to author
ize the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion to iix maximum rates, and on the
Panama canal, due to a controversy
over the reference of ilie emergency
appropriation bill to a committee, to
Â«iay's f-essioii of the Senate continuous
ly proved interesting for more than
four hours.
An adjournment was taken without a
mention of the late Senator Mitchell of
Ore.S'jn, and so for the first time the
ficath of a Senator was permitted to
pass unnoticed by the Senate. The
erasure of Mitchell's name from the
rolJs followed. Chaplain Hale recalled
the situation to mind in his prayer by
referring poin-tedly to corruption and
<j<*tlj and by praying that members of
the Senate be given strength to bear
one another's burdens.
The debate on the Tillman bill was
engaged in by a number of Senators.
F-uakcr declared that the bill proved
that its author believed the present
laws were sufficient to correct all-al
legred transportation evils except ex
cesslve rates and that there was ample
provision for the punishment of rebate
glring.
Tillman responded that he had
thought the laws sufficient until the in
vestigation begun by Judfon and Har
mon into the Santa Fe case had ter
minated in a pitiable fiasco.
FVÂ»raker asserted that the law could
wot be blamed if "some person fell
short In his duty." He intimated in
l;is discussion that there would be some
extended controversies before the rail
road rate bills were disposed of this
sueslon.

Impound Waters and Tun
nel 3lountaiii;
REDLANDS, Dec. ILâ Plans made pub
lip here to-day indicate that an immense
irrigaiio:. nroiect Is 1 ack of the pur
chase by â¢ a syndicate of the Rancho
Vtrdc. on the Mojave River, north of the
Eierra Madre Mountains. The Rancho
Verde was recently sold to a syndicate
by E. C. Sterling and Reginald Frost of
IMs city for $37u,00d. The syndicate has
slnci- acquired the water rights of all
ranchers on the Mojave River save two.
Jt is now proposed to erect a dam 175
feet high at Narrows, on the Mojave
River, where the opening through the
low range of mountains h? but 150 feet
wide. This will flood the Ranftho Verde
ai:d other farms, making a lake ten miles
long and one and a half miles wide, im
pounding enough water to supply a con
tinuous flow r-.f 5000 miners' inches. It is
proposed to bring this water to the San
Bernardino Valley by a gravity flow. To
do this n^nuires a tunnel through the
mountains nearly twenty mile 3 long and
ever 1000 fw>t below the surface at the
t ummlt of Cajon Pass, where it probably
will come through. Shafts are to be
sunk about a mi!e apart from the sur
-laoe to the tunnel beneath. The propo
sition Involves the expenditure' of over
fj.'jOO.onO and will take a number of years
to complete. The syndicate takes pos-
Fo-^i'jn ol the property on April 15.

Committee' -/Assignments, as

Are Cause of an Uprising
WASHINGTON, -, Dec. U.-^John Sharp
Williams/ the minority leader of the
House, "stepped 'on the lid" to-day ; just
in time to" prevent revelations in the na
ture or open criticism of the committee
assignments of certain of his colleagues,
for which he is responsible.
Payne, . the Republican leader, naively
suggested a way by which the . revela
tions might be* made, but Williams as
sumed all responsibility and declined to
allow the "washing of Democratic linen
for the amusement of the Republicans." ,
The incident followed the announcement
of the committees. I>arnar of Florida sub
mitted and. had 'read a newspaper clip- j
ping purporting to -quote Williams to the
efTfecf that I^a mar and Shackleford of
Missouri had Ween left oft! the Interstate
and Foreign Commerce Committee be- |
cause* they had failed to follow the Dem- â¢
ocratic caucus action of the last session
on the railroad rate bill. Speaker Cannon :
suggested that the statement read did nbt j
constitute a question of personal privi
lege wh lch- entitled Lamar to the floor.
"The gentleman might proceed by.unan
imous consent," suggested Payne. "How \u25a0
much time does he wantâ an hour?" ;
It was here that Williams strode for- |
ward from, hla seat in the rdar. . He hailed i
.the". Speaker, with" word and gesture, and:
when he got" his eye reserved his right to I
object .only long, enough to mako tha
statement -.that in the interest of Demo
cratic "harmony, fairness and of general
good will, which will not be promoted by
washing Democratic linen for the amuse
ment of the Republicans of the House â I
object." ,' . - ' ' t
Immediately the question became inter
esting. Lamar faced Williams, who stood
close to him, and charged him with hav
ing taken the matter Into tho news
papers. Shackleford was on his feet
vainly, demanding to ask a question, and
mrtny- Democrats applauded the stand
taken by Williams. Lamar demanded that
Williams call a Democratic caucus to
morrow, or allow him to proceed.
Speaker Cannon wielded his gavel vigor
ously and declared everybody out of or
der, and In the midst of the confusion
recognized Payne for a motion to adjourn,
which was declared carried, and the ses
sion was over until Wednesday. .

"going to get him" he probably told the
woman. A strong effort will be made to
locate her to-day. The police have a clew
as to her whereabouts and are confident
that she, will be located.
For four days the police of Oakland and
San Francisco have been working on the
mystery which surrounds the finding of
the f man identified as McGrath. On
Thursday afternoon two boys, M. B.
Maurice and A..P. Pivar, who were fish
ing from the Oakland broad gauge molo,
discovered the body of the young man on
the rocks, lying face downward. The
corpse had been In tho water, and at flrdt
glance it seemed to have been only a case
of drowning. \u25a0
After the Coroner had taken charge a
wound in the center of the forehead was
disclosed. Examination of the body at
the Morgue revealed the fact that this
was a bullet hole. The first noticeably
suspicious circumstance about the wound
was the entire absence of powder marks
or burns around the bullet hole. This
gave rise to the theory of murder.. It
seemed practically impossible for. the vic
tim to have shot himself without leaving
traces of powder around the, wound. The
murder theory was further irrermthened
by the autopsy, which, was held by Dr.
O. D. Hamlin Thursday night. Dr. Ham
lin, an expert on the \ subject, after a
careful examination declared It to be his
opinion that the wound was not self-in-
I fllctod. He based this orv the absence of

the skull, the course of the bullet through
the brain and the fact that the man died
from a gunshot wound and not from ,
drowning. % \u25a0 '<.
The condition of the lungs showed that
the victim . was not asphyxiated, while
j the general condition of the body indi
cated that It had fceeri in the water
I about fortyjjight hours. Another pecu
liar phase of the rase was tho fact that !
there v<as not a single article found in
the man s clothingâ absolutely nothing by
which a -clew to hlB identity could be
given. The garments had been stripped
bare. As soon 'as these circumstances
v/ere disclosed . detectives went to work
.on the case. They labored for many
hours. The stretch, of half-submerged
rocks along the mole.was;clpsely covered
. in the hope that the rdead! man's hat or a
pistol might be found, resulted.
' Hundreds of persona* viewed the body |
at the Morgue without" a single trace of
identification' being: ;i uncovered. Coroner
Mehrmann " ordered * the i^body embalmed
and -,ke?t as long as possible in the hope j
that some one might come forward. "All j
sorts of theories were advanced as to the '
manner of death. At the outset some of j
the police were chary of the murder Idea. |

President Benjamin Ide- "Wheeler dis
cussed the" action ol the- joint university
athletic committee last night, saylnc:
V"ThB action of the committee this after
noon Is" Intended' tbresuitrflrst in'a com
plete separation of the Pacific Coast col- :
legiate sports from the so-called rules
committee in the East,-; a committee to
which we have never really â¢ owed alle- I
giance and upon, which we have never j
had representation. We feel justified, ac- [
cordingly. In freeing ourselves from its
domination: . â¢ J v
"The committee proposed as . a primary i
end. to endeavor to -remove -some of the 1
evils that now afflict Uh'e sport of foot- j
ball. WÂ« are agreed tnat the game as It
is played " now calls for' an organization'
which I* too elaborated 'The game is too j
technical. It calls for* players of the cata- j
pult type. The coach simply puts the,
heavy men on the line and shoots them
forward against the opposing line.
t "It seems to be believed that -If the
Rugby game Is Introduced much of the
roughness - now \u25a0 complained of "will be
eliminated Also, the game. Is expected
to be~mbre interesting" from" the stand
point of the average spectator. If it- is
possible to so improve 'the present game
as to eradicate the evils v Ve ...deplore, then |
the game as Improved ,. will ' be adopted.
The advisory committee we have" secured
will, I' believe,' provide us with a game
that will be satisfactory in every way, or
at least very much more satisfactory
than the game as It is now."
Colonel George C. Edwards, chairrnau
of the faeultv athletic committee, gave
out the following statement last night:
*'T v he universities of this coast have
finally decided to break away from the
Eastern rule* committee, and I am glad
of It. .Those of us who have followed
the game as played here have resented
the* various moves made by thl3 rules
committee In the Ea?t, but we have not
made any very strenuous protests, ex
pecting that the reforms which evidently
were needed would soon be inaugurated.
Instead of the conditions being made
better, however, they have become worse.
"We consider that to-day we have
signed our. declaration of Independence
and now that we are perfectly free It
is our purpose to formulate rules for a
game that will preserve the spirit of foot
ball, but without the evils that have at
tended the game for a long time. I be
lieve that the introduction of the Rugby
game would be an- excellent thing. The
game as Dlayed now is merely an off
shoot of the old game. ' It has grown
rotten with time. Now we will cut off
the bad parts and return to the old
stock." \u0084 "
Professor H- B. Torrey. a member of
the athletic committee, has announced his
belief In the advisability of reverting to
the old Rugby game.
Roy Elliott, captain of the varsity
football team, said last night that the
idea of going back to the Rugby game
was a surprise to him, but he "supposed
a trial of It wonldn't hurt anybody." El
liott said:
"I don't profess* to know anything about,
the Rugby gam*, but if it Is demanded
by the circumstances, let's give It a trial.
If Rugby Is .satisfactory .to the students
and the college officials I will do all that
Is possible for me todo'to make and
keep the j "game popular. "
"I understand that a Rugby team from
New Zealand .la to come here this . win
ter and will give an exhibition game on
the campus next term. We are lucky
In having a coach, Dr. T^ylcr. who knows
Rugby as well as the present game, and
so we will be sure of expert Instruction
If Rugby Is decided upon."
; They suggested suicide. But the more
they studied, the more they came to the
conclusion that the case was oneÂ«'of foul
play and that the unidentified stranger
; had been shot by another hand than hi 3
own. . But there the police were at sea.
Tfcey had nothing more and until the
Sausalito clew came to light it appeared
as if the body must so to the Potter's

CAUGHT BY POLICE
SURRENDER AFTER A LONG > CHASE
Officer Ward Gathers
in Sheehan and
â¢ Condon
Pair Had Just Robbed
Traveler Named
Winsldw.
_
iwo desperate criminals who haÂ»-e been
â¢working their trade in this city with
.â¢r.uch success for several years fell into
the arms of the- law early yesterday
morning. They are Henry Sheehan and
John Condon, though they tried to hide
Their identity with fictitious names. They
were captured by Officers Ward and
Casey on Jones street, near Geary, after
a thrilling chase.
A bit of clever shadowing on the part of
Policeman Ward resulted in the capture
cf the men. He was patrolling his beat
along Leaven worth street shortly after 4
o'clock when he noticed E. N. Winslow,
a commercial traveler, going along Leav- i
Â« nworth street to his room. 404 Eddy
Ftreec In close pursuit were the two
thugs.
Ward concluded to await developments
and dodged into a doorway. His watch
was rewarded, for in a few minutes he
put the two men rush out of the door
way and take uy the street. Right be
hind staggered Winslow. He informed
Ward that the bold pair had choked. him
.-md held him up in the hallway at 404
Eddy street and robbed him of his gold
uatch, fob. knife, key ring and a quan
tity of money.
Ward lost no time in giving chase to
the thieves. He started up Leavenworth
street after them, and on Ellis street near
Jones he commanded them to halt. But
the thugs kept on, and Ward, seeing
they were likely to get away from him,
?.red his revolver in the air and blew his
whistle several times.
Policeman Casey heard these warnings
and then the exciting- chase began in
earnest; The men continued to run along
Jones street, and near Geary they were
overtaken by Casey, who covered them
with his revolver. The crooks, seeing
ii v .at the game was up. surrendered with
out showing fight. Ward soon joined
< ascy, who had both men In the middle
of the street with their hands high in the
iiir. They mildly submitted to be hand
cuffed and were marched off to the City
I'rison. where charges of robbery were
registered against them. \u25a0 \u25a0:' v
During the chase Policeman Ward no
ticed the men throw something into a
garden on Ellis street. Both officers
made a search of the place and discovered
Winslowfs' watch, fob, knife and key
ring. The.*e articW were booked as evi
dtv.ee against "the thugs.
When the men were booked at the City
Prison Detectives Regran and O'Connell
were brought in " to identify them. The
detectives recognized both as desperate
characters who have been operating in
the city with much success^ for- some
time. The men are known as "drunk
rollers" and both have been in trouble
many times before. ~-" 3 /*
Condon was arrested in January, 1902.
fur robbery, but was acquitted on March
4. In August, 1903. he was again tangled
vp in the meshes of the law, being arrest
c-d as a suspicious character, but again he
managed to go free, being discharged
after a few days.
The police believe these two men are
responsible for a number of robberies
committed lately, and It looks as If they
hs.\-Â«Â» the e\ - idence so strong this time
that both will do terms acroes the bay
for their daring crime. 'Â»V'~*

Taylor's Friends Are Robbers
The police have arrested and placed
behind the bars of the City Prison Ike
Abraham. L. C Smith and Rockey Clow
for the hold-up of E. F. Taylor last
Thursday night, j They are still after a
fourth man whose name they know..
Abraham and, Smith were companions
of Taylor on the night of the hold-up
and pretended to be his friends. They I
steered him to a dark alley near Stock- j
ton and Jackson streets, and there Clow i
and his partner relieved all three, of j
the money on their persons. Taylor |
was separated from $55 in gold and I
Smith and Abraham each lost $1 apiece.'
The police investigated the case and
arrested Smith and Abraham. As soon j
as Abraham was placed In a cellVhej
seemed to lose his nerve and to Detec- i
tlves Bunner and Freel he made a full
confession. He told them that he and
Smith had planned the hold-up with
Clow and another man . and that tho |
affair came out just as they had ar
ranged. They knew that Taylor had
money. Smith and Clow deny that they
bad anything to do with the case. The
pollce, however,, are that
Abraham told them the truth.
But the hold-up of Taylor was no or-j
dinary robbery of one: man by. a gang
of crooks. Behind' it there is a story
of a man who gave food and lodgings
to two old acquaintances who were in'
dire need of Help, but who had sunk so
low in the mire of that,
while they accepted his bounty, they
plotted against him. They were -not
satisfied to be fed' and lodged', until
they secured employment, but must rob
their benefactor.
HAD BEEN OLD . FRIENDS. /
Taylor, Abraham and Smith had been
schoolmates .In t Montgomery, Alabama.':
Taylor was chief clerk in a railroad
office and Abraham and Smith were
working in the town. About six months
ago, according to the story of Taylor, â¢!
Smith and Abraham left Montgomery
for the coast. Taylor fell sick soon â¢
| afterward and the railroad granted him
Ja leave of absence for three months.
!He came to San Francisco to recutf
< crate. - Thss was on October 3.
! About two weeks ago he was sur
! prised to meet Abraham and Smith on
Market street. He was startled at their
.appearance, for, according to his story, !
.they were without funds and were In
(desperate straits* for food. They had
no work.
Taylor's heart was -full of pity as ho
' heard the tale of his two old friends,
'so he took them up. to his own lodg-'
I ings at 122 Taylor â¢ street. There" he
gave them" money to buy. food and, kept
them with him. They seomed to be
deeply grateful and., told Taylor that
they would soon have work.
Last . Thursday Taylor, received - his
transportation to return to Montgom^,
cry. -He < also . received 'â¢ a? . check . \u25a0 for
$65. .' He showed both . the check ' and
the- transportation to his friends 'â and
told them that â¢he would leave on the
morrow., â¢ '\u25a0 . ;, v ; 3
.Abraham at once , proposed .that, the
three .visit * , Chinatown ; that flight.*
Taylor had never' visited an opium 1 den"
and Abraham; promised' to show].: him'
one. They.', started ..out 'late :atinlght : i
and left an opium den about midnight. |
SEARCH OXLY ONE POCKET^ j
As the. three wandered : down -Stock- j
ton street And approached r Jackson ;
two men leeped out from, an alley. J
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER .12, 1905.
One of them covered Taylor with a re
volver and demanded that he throw
up his hands. Taylor pretended to' do
so, but grasped the man's revolver.'.' A
struggle ensued and Taylor was get
ting the best of it, when the other
robber left Abraham and Smith, whom
he had covered, and struck Taylor over
the head. The other robber slipped his
hand into Taylor's hip pocket. "Have
you got it?" cried the first. "Yes/
said the other. Then the two men fled.
In the meantime, Taylor declares, If
his friends had been active they could
have captured the robbers. He report
ed the loss to \u25a0 the police, as did Smith
and Abraham. ' The next day he left
for home minus the $55! he had carried
with him that night. He did not sus
pect his friends, although he wondered
how the robbers, knew in which pocket
he kept the purse.
But Detectives Ed Wren. Free! and
Bunner felt that there was something
wrong- about the story and as a I flier
arrested Abraham on. Friday.. He was
locked '-upVand soon* thereafter con
fessed. .He ' gave [ them the- name' of
Clow and 'another. '' 'Smith., telephoned
down to the-prisonl after Abraham and
was induced to come down on pretext
that Abraham was \ about to be " re-"
leased and was promptly /arrested.
Clow was taken the next day. , - The
police kept the arrests quiet 'until .they
could __ get all of , those , i mplicated. lln
the | meantime Taylor \ was stopped at
Salinas "and brought_ back to identify
the, robbers. â¢ . . , ." ; ;
The- police are elated over the,cap
ture, of "these: men. They believe that
they* have" been implicated 'in other
crimes.': They; give credit: to the clever
work of. Detectives Freel and

. Lord' Rosebery gave his blessing to the
new Liberal Cabinet at the meeting of the
council of the: Liberal League in London
this afternoon:" He said he believed -the
composition of the new Ministry must
fill them all with pleasure,: and he .con
gratulated Sir Henry _ Campbell-Banner
man on his selections. / His lordship add
ed that all the offices were 'well filled,
and the country might now expect econ
omy in finance and continuity of strength
and dignity in its foreign policy, and
might even hope to" see an army once
more. 'â¢'''.. v... \u25a0" :.; -.. \u25a0'- : - ' -L
TJord Rosebery, however, " declared : that
he "absolutely and steadfastly adhered
to" his speech in Bodminton.in which he
said he could not serve under Campbell-
Bannerman's home rule banner. ' He said
that he had not personally; received any
assurances from the Liberal Premier jon
the subject of home rule,, but he was
satisfied that the vice presidents of the
league. Sir Edward Grey, > Mr. v Asquith
and Mr. Haldane, had received assurances
to the effect that his (Lord" Rosebery's)
Interpretation of Campbell-Banherman's
speech at Stirling was incorrect. Lord
Rosebery, however, thought it ' strange
that Campbell-Bannerman had not taken
the opportunity in his more recent speeches
Xo repudiate his (Lord Rosebery's) inter
pretation if it was not correct. His
speech, at any rate, he; declared, had
cleared the air, and with Sir \ Edward
Grey and Messrs. Asquitn ; Haldane
as members of the Government the coun
try-had a guarantee that an 'lrish home
rule bill would not be introduced -in the
next Parliament. '\u25a0/\u25a0'\u25a0'-'; '' \u25a0
Lord Rosebery concluded with saying
that as Liberals it was ; their duty jto
maintain a united free trade party. -. He
hoped and prayed it might be absolutely
independent of the Irish vote. A Liberal
party relying on that vote would not pos
sess the confidence of the country- Such
an alliance would not be \ very ; good for
the. Irish, and would be wholly bad for
the Liberals.
ANXIETY FELT
FOR GUNBOAT
NEW BEDFORD, Mass.,' Dec. 12.â The
lighthouse tender Azalea arrived here ; at
2:15 o'clock this morning : with , the crew
of the ; Nantucket .South Shoal lightship.
The lightship foundered at 4 a. m. on
Monday eighteen miles .west of her sta- '
tlon while in tow of the tender. - .
Great anxiety Is felt for. : the gunboat
Wasp, which started out about, dark on
Saturday night to aid the brig Harry
Smith, said to be' in a bad- position at
the entrance of Vineyard Sound. ; "She
Wasp carried a crew of 'eighty men, was
commanded by Chief Boatswain Hugh
Sweeney and was provisioned for three
days. ' -
It was a run of about two hours to the
entrance of the 'sound, but scarcely had
the Wasp left" this harbor when the
storm, which had been threatening all
day, broke. It was not surprising to the
naval officers that tha Wasp missed the
Smith under the conditions which | pre
vailed. On Sunday afternoon -, after the
storm had passed, word was . received
that the Smith - was . still at anchor near
Vineyard . Sound/but ; nothing â¢ could be
seen of the Wasp. , â¢
The Wasp is g not equipped with wire
less telegraph, neither did , those on board
know of j the predicament of f : the 'Nan
tucket r lightship, 4 so Â£ that the >; gunboat
would not j have gone out to that station
unless' In. the hope. of getting new orders
by the lightships- wireless equipment.'
The storm vras far- more severe off
shore. , and it is believed by the naval
officials that the Wasp experienced some
thing bordering on; a hurricane and may
have been driven far out, to sea.

here to-day from the steamships Pa

and thatUhe massacres were not race

.While: telling .their -stories the men
sometimes. burst into tears, for perhaps
half of the entire" number had left.be
hind them wives and children who were
either dead or defenseless in Russian
cities. . : There were three Jews from
Odessa, all of whom, six weeks ago to-,
day, on -Monday, October .- 30- â the day
that- the' Czar proclaimed Russia's con

led the ; peaceable portion,^ while dls~
guised police usually led: the' hoodlums.
After the first ' two | days he and two
companions .escaped .-from- the . city.
Chanoch .said: ;
During the first day, after 'the manifesto it
seemed to me . to be very quiet, for nearly
all the Jews remained Indoors, hiding. Some
times I - heard . people . marching: through the
streets. Six weeks ago to-day I lay with sev

of the Daily Mail . at St. Petersburg, In
a dispatch dated December 10, sends an
Interview, with Count de Witte, In which
the Premier indicates that Russia Is con
fronted with the alternative of, a revolu
tion . or. violent coercion. Though the
Count has not abandoned hope, he Is not
sanguine," and if forcible repression shall
become necessary he' will, according to
the : correspondent, "resign hia task to
other hands.
Questioned by the correspondent as to
the genesis .of the revolutionary move
ment, Premier de Witte attributed its
rapid development to the granting of
autonomy , to the universities and the
high schools, where the revolutionary
forces, hitherto doomed to secrecy, found
asylum and sanctuary and absolute free
dom for discussion. When this freedom
became licensed, society still looked on
with stolid . Indifference. Continuing.
Count de Witte said:
; On imjf return from Portsmouth I found thÂ»
country .in a difficult " position, from which
there were only .two issues. . The problem was
thorny and fateful, but , after long and careful
deliberation. the Emperor, who needed no per
suasion, acted on his own initiative, and.
never doubting: that he could build upon the
moral courage and the political grood sense of
the majority of his subjacts. took the course
of issuing, his manifesto of October 30 not only
with alacrity, but with pleasure.
Clearly the vast changes which the mani
festo heralded required time and patience to car
ry out, but was occurred was utterly unex
pected. Sections of the ; communityâ nay.
whole classes â went to work systematically to
annihilate their own . means of livelihood and
to ruin themselves and the' whole nation. In
stead or uniting to preserve order, the people
quarreled among- themselves and attacked the
Government. \u25a0
The only people who acted In their own In
terests were the- revolutionists. They knew
what they wanted. They chose the most ef
fective means to attain It and they are capa
ble of adopting these means even at the price
of heavy'sacrlnces. . The revolutionists hide all
their quarrels and animosities and act together
for the end they have In view, which spells
destruction: .Out of the resultant chaos i they
promise a new world and an earthly. paradise.
After admittinz that the manifesto had
indirectly intensified the revolutionary
movement,. the Premier said:
Unfortunately, the- people at large take the
view that It . Is the â¢ Government's % business to
realize constitutional' principles and to fight
the revolution. -Doubtless the Government can
employ force, but force ie only an evidence of
weakness, unless It is leveled by the social
conscience ' against the -â¢ public enemy. If a
community will j not ' struggle â¢ against anarchy,
no government can successfully cope with it.
Count de "Wltte contended that the same
argument applied to strikes.
With. regard to the Jewish Question, he
said it was impossible at the present mo
ment to proclaim . equality of rights, be
cause such a measure would provoke ap
palling 1 bloodshed.
In conclusion the Premier said:
. Unless all elements of society abandon their
own differences of opinion and join hands to
assist the Government in checking anarchy and
in carrying out the Emperor's manifesto, the
situation may be regarded as truly disquieting
and serious. I With the moral help of the com
munity and with the efficacious measures of
the Government all may yet be righted, but
without that help anarchy, will continue until
finally the nation may demand the suppression
of revolution by force, and then it is. not im
possible that ' the : principles . embodied In the
manifesto may be repealed or suspended.
To . the . query, "Are you prepared for
recourse to â¢ coercion?" Count de "Wltte
replied: c \u25a0
-i If this alternative comes to i pass It will be
confided \u25a0to somebody qualified to essay it. . I
assuredly am not' so qualified.- In. this %atter

: In order to. compel the mutineers to

men to set fire to the barracks and the
public buildings. The blaze spread to
all parts ; of the city*- and the mutineers,
in trying to escape, were slaughtered
to the number of 300 by. the cavalry.
Later the loyal portion of the garri

each pther. It bein* Impossible to dis

NEW YORK. Dec. 11. â Sending wire
less messages through the human body,
lighting an incandescent lamp by using
only one wire, transmitting power
without wires, melting metal wire with
currents passing through the human
body and - sending strong currents
through two inches of solid glass were
a few of the many interesting experi
ments with electricity made In the
concert hall of the Madison-square
Garden, .to-night. Professor Earle I*.
Ovlngton of Boston was the wizard.
To those not having a technical
knowledge of electricity perhaps the
most interesting feature of Professor
Ovlngton's demonstration was the send
ing of currents through his body a hun
dred-fold more powerful than those
used in putting men to death in Sing
Sing. About 7000 volts are used to
cause death, while Professor Ovlngton
sent 300,000 through his body. The
only danger, he said, was in the reduc
tion of the current from the high volt
age to low amperage.

ALBANY. X. T.. Dec. ULâ Argument
was begun in the Court of Appeals to-daj*
in the New York ballot-box case. The
contest represents the contention of W. R.
Hearst, John Ford, and J. G. Phelps
Stokes, Municipal Ownership candidates,
that at the election of November 7 they
were rightfully elected respectively to'. the
offices of Mayor, T Controller arid Presi
dent :of the Board of Aldermen of New
iYork>
, ? Judge Parker, representing^ the claims of
\u2666Mayor MeClellan and his Democratic col
leagues, - declared â¢ there is nothing to bo
found in the election law. which in terms
authorizes the court to direct either a re
count .or a" recanvass \u25a0 of. the vote.
An ' \u25a0 opinion " written by Judge Parker
himself .when Cru"ef Justice of this court
in an 'Ulster County , election*case*involv
ing the office of Supervisor, in which a
recount of ballots was ordered, was used
by the attorney for Hearst In behalf of
their, contention. .Judge Parker, in reply,
argued that his decision should not bind
the : court \u25a0 since the points at issue were
not entirely.; the same; in the two cases.
It- is [believed .that {. a decision will be
rendered this -week, because of the'im

HER ART MELLOWS IN ONE YEAR
lne rires of St
John" Is Strong
Play.
Grand Opera-House
Audience Enjoys
Production.
The glove is downâ Nance O'Nell came
back last night. This strange disturbing
personality that has had Boston by the
ears, XÂ«w York in arms, city against
city, returned to her birthplace last night
to Â«et it wondering, questioning, chal
lenging, adoring once again. She brought
the O'Neil kind of play, the big thing, a
modern this time. "The Fires of St.
John," by the dramatist who gave her
one of her finest opportunities â Suder
mann and "ila^da." The Grand Opera
house despite Christmas shopping was
handsomely filled, fashion streaking the
house, and friends leading a willing ap
plause.
"The Fires of St. John" is hardly an
other "Magda." It lacks of that much
la clearness, strength and originality. Yet
â¢ originality it has. vividness, and that
queer accent of truth that makes one feel
its story too strange not to bf true. ,
Heredity is the central thought with a
girl who plays the Mrs. Alvlng to her
own "ghosts." There is a strong tang
of Maeterlinck also in the play, in the
fateful symbolism that weaves through it.
But Sudermann's gospel here is distinctly
more hopeful than that of Ibsen's great
drama of heredity. "At leapt." he
preaches with the newer biologists, "if
you are the sura of your ancestors, you
also have at least the privilege of making
a few, new. absolutely home-grown
ghosts of your own."
Mario, adopted child of the Brauers, is
the heroine of the play. Marie's mother (of
whom she baa been kept in ignorance) is a
gypsy, supposed to be dead, really at the
opening of the story just released from a
five-year term of imprisonment for theft.
Marie is found, a prideful drudge in the
home of the Brauers, who are good, usual
folk, quite sensible of their charity to her.
Her foster-sister, Gertrude, is to be mar
ried in four days, and Marie, to satisfy
her faratical pride, is overworking herself
on the wedding preparations. We learn.
In a not too clear fashion, and rather
late, that she is in love with Gertrude's
lover, he with her, neither knowing of the
other's love.
But Marie learns of her mother's exist
ence. She asks George (.the lover) to
bring the gypsy to the house. Just before
ehe has told him of a poem she has found
among his books written to her betraying
his love, ghe lies fluently about it, re
peatedly. The mother comes. The daugh
ter dies many deaths. Servile, fawning,
the creature asks clothes of her. wine,
and at last pilfers some linen and lies,
lies. Shuddering the girl drives her away.
To the man she says: "I. too. am a thief,
like my mother." Stronger line than this
even Is where she says to the pastor, that
in the gospel of the weak It stands: "Thou
Bhalt steal. As my mother Is, so am
J.". But Marie .baa not reckoned with the
iorees -of environment, nw witli^that new, ;
:&bjsolute self that is hers. Dully she has
made up her mind that she Is doomed to
steal her sister's lover.
Hopeless confession follows. It is the
eve of St. John's, fires naming from every
hill to freedom, happiness. She will be
free, will be happy. The third act cur
tain leaves the lovers .in each- other's
arms, and George in the next says that
"they are man and wife In the sight of
heaven." But the last curtain goes down
on Marie, alone, her lover and
her fester-sister leaving to go to church.
Miss O'Neil interests powerfully, as al
v.-ayp, as .Marie. Pale, pale-eyed, black
li aired, she is singularly In the picture as
a picture and most eloquently gets into It
the morbidness, the nobility, the pride, the
romanticism of the figure. Repression,

reappearance at the A lea tar last night In' his

It- seamed .rather a house-warming-, than * a

fcai:(3rlapj>lr.e that would not stop and delayed
the progress of the play for some time. Tears
came into the eye* of the veteran actor when,
accompanied by cries of "Fresno!" an Im

with human nature, and betrays Its . French

PITTSBURG, Dec. 11.â Mme. Saridal-
Bramsen,- concert . qlhger and; wife of
the first cellist of the-Pittsburg orches
tra, has the temerlly and moral courage
to defy fashion* and society by discard
ing corsets and : h<fclery to wear "bare
footed" Grecian sandals." *
Mme. Brarasen," since she came to
Plttsburg. with .her husband from Nor
way a few weeks ago, has been \u25a0 the \u25a0
cause of comment'and gossip in musical
circles :and elsewhere and has. been
characterizedr^as - "eccentric." What
ever her oddities of dress or her unor
thodox points \u25a0of \u25a0 views concerning
other matters, the gifted Norwegian is,
nevertheless, one of the most interest
ing characters before the Pittsburg pub
lic to-day. She has shocked . certain
persons because ; she does; not ; wear
stockings in the house and because she
has : never- worn corsets, -either on the
stage, the concert platform or in-her
home. . * V 'j :'\u25a0 ''. ':.

Speaking about her methods of dress,
the singer explained that she thought

MRS. GURNETT'S DEATH
OCCUPIES POLICE.
MORTON STICKS TO STORY
MRS. JULIA GURNETT, Wh6 WAS FOUND DEAD IN THE TAILOR SHOP OF '
CHARLES L. MORTON", A ' NEGRO, WHO IS BEING HELD ON SUS
PICION'OF HAVING DONE MURDER. â
OAKLAND, Dec. " ILâ Was Mrs. Julia
Gurnett murdered as she pat drinking
with Charles L. Morton, a negro, in .his
tailor shop at 541 Sixteenth street Satur
day night?
The police are inclined to believe that
ehe was not, but they are holding' Mor
ton at the City Prison pending a further
Investigation. Mrs. â¢ Gurnetfs .body was
found in Morton's tailor shop early yes
terday morning, and it was at first
thought that she was a, victim of heart
disease. An autopsy, however, proved
conclusively that she had died from suf
focation, and Morton is neld to allow the
police to Investigate further.
While Morton tells a straightforward
story of the woman's death, Mrs. M. Taf t,
who lives at 539 Sixteenth street, declares
she heard eounds of a scuffle in the tailor
chop next door between 9:30 and 10:30
o'clock Saturday night. Morton says
that what Mrs. Taft heard must have
been the falling of Mrs. Gurnett to the
floor. He said to-day:
Mn Gurnett's sister, Maggie Braehm, for
merly worked for me and It was through her
that I met the woman who Is now dead. About
noon Saturday Mrs. Gurnett came to ray shop
under the influence of liquor. She had a pint
flask cf whisky and 1 drank with her. She
lei and returned between 8 and 9 o clock In
the evening. She sat In a chair near the gas
ircn heater. At 8 o'clock I began turning out
the Hehta Whether I turned out the gas In
the heater I do not, remember. When I was
prepared to lock the door, I told her we must
leave. ShÂ« asked me for a drink and I gave
her one from a whisky flask. As she returned
the flask to me-sbe arose, gasped and fell to
the floor. I tried to arouse her, but she only
groaned. Then I put my coat under her head
and lay flown on tha ironing board, thinking
that ate would soon revive from what I be
lieved a drunken stupor. I fell asleep and
the next thing I remember was when my sis
ter Mrs. E. Chapman, came to the door Sun
day morning. I did not call a doctor or notify
thÂ» Dollce because I wished to shield the wom
an fivro (JlsKrace. When my. sister entered
the room fine declared that Mrs. Gurntt was
dead I toW her to notify tl>e police and I
remained in the : shop with the corpse until
Pollcey-an McScrley arrived.
Detective George Kyte stated to-day
that the woman may have been overcome
by the fumes of gas from the iron-heater.
Coroner Mehrmann has sent the wom
an's stomach to City Chemist Rowe |to
have its contents analyzed, and \u25a0 Morton
will be held until Dr. Rowe shall have
completed his analysis.
The dead woman was the divorced wife
of Byron Gurnett, and lived with her
mother, Mrs. yulia Donahue, at 1261 Kirk
hem street

Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 11.â
1 A writer in the Stanford Sequoia, the
.' literary Journal lot the j university, in
I its {issue of this month .'makes several
strong; statements about "intercolleg
iate gambling." .The writer cites as
an (instance the meeting of collegians
of the two rival universities In a saloon
in San Francisco and the open making
of : bets: on the chances of their respec- |
tive football' elevens. He tells '"of the ;
practice of the fraternities of the unl-,!
versities ; Jn\ exchanging \ money â¢ and 1
| placingr it* to {.the?, best 'advantage on
t contests." 'He also declares that the
[â¢ state of -affairs at present \u25a0is disgrace
ful: : The article" in partis:
f A'feature of - the intercollegiat* contests that i
seems to trow worse year by: year -is the bet- I
'tins among \u25a0 the -undergraduates upon the re- I
cults. -Owing toy.the" great \u25a0.Interest in this i
year' s\, contest s the gambling . spirit was un
usually : sti-or.*, and a" large part of. the talk
among the i under graduates was not \u25a0 upon the
. merits -of \u25a0\u25a0 the teams, but . on - the odds which
could be . obtained lin '.the. saloons .and else
whore iin San Krancisco,: at Berkeley and here.
It - .was-: announced .that there i was ; $500 of
"Berkeley/ money ">a^ even. odds", la a' certain
saloon' of San X^rancisco, and - there was :|2t>o
of' â¢ 'Berkeley money at 10 to- T" at another
saloon awaiting takers. ' We heard stories of
California fraternities sending, down large
amounts to -. fraternities here to be placed at
the best advantage, and we : heard- of special
trips between the two â¢ universities '.for the
purpose of getting "easy money."
It Is .our boast ' that college athletics are
peculiarly clean. Can we . say this with hon
esty when -we go out and scheme to make
money out of the personal efforts of eleven
of our college mates-f-men who give months
of harii, earnest work for the pure love of the
sport and the honor of representing their uni
versity? . Is It fair to these men that they
should go Into the game knowing that hun
dreds of dollars of - their friends' money de
pends, on their, success? la It encouraging or
Inspiring to them to- realize that they are be
ing gambled on as- so many race horses or
prize figh'ers ? la this ' a condition that any
one would care to Dublicly care to defend?
It certainly is not a condition that harmonizes
with Stanford's effort* to keep university
sports hljovp t"he level of the race track and
the prize ring nÂ«d the professional diamond,
nor is If a condition that harmonizes with any
of the Stanford ideals.
There hes always been gambling on Inter
collegiate sports, for there are \u25a0 men who are
ever ready to make a Ramble even of their
own flesh and blood. But the ever growing
mactice iÂ«= thoroughly vicious, and If we- do
hot" wont" to see the evils of professional rot
tenness and crooked dealings come Into col
lie st>ortÂ» we would better change our ways.
The present condition of Stanford athletics
Is a blot upon university sports and a dis
grace to the tv.en of th* university.

This was the majority report pf the
I committee appointed to Investigate the
(application oMVL Evans, promoter or
i the proposed California and Inland Em
pire Railroad Company, for a franchise to
use a strip about one mile long and 150
feet wide on Railroad avenue at the regu
lar meeting of Town Trustees to-night.
Evans would not put up the bond or
1 bonus and seeing the determination of
the Board of Trustees to abide by the
report, withdrew his application. He
1 thanked the board and citizens for their
consideration and retired with several!
persons favorable, to. > his .application.
There .was a demonstration made when
Evan3 withdrew the application.
The meeting was called to* order by
\ Mayor Jacaues Thomas, Trustees L. C.
Pistolesl and -W. J.- Martin were present.
Trustee Hughes being too ill to attend.
The \u25a0 resolution practically formed by
A. E. Roberts, a railway contractor, and
adopted by a mass meeting last Saturday
evening demanding that the board grant
the franchise without a bond or a bonus
and a petition with the same purport with
200 signers were read and placed on file.
Evans was invited to address the board.
He produced and read . an ordinance
granting him the franchise. He asked for
a 150-foot strip on Railroad avenue with
a water frontage of a mile. He 'agreed;
to expend J20.000 within one year on
dredging and railroad work in this town
and to construct and operate 200 miles of
track out of Sausalito within 'three years.
Evans said:
v "I absolutely refuse to divulge who
are back of me. There has been much
adverse criticism of me and the sincer
ity, of my, motives. My motives are
sincere and every proposition I make
will be faithfully observed. There Is
no precedent of a railroad company
giving a bond or a bonus for a fran
chise and I absolutely refuse to estab
lish one. It is my intention to with
draw my application for a franchise
if you are .not disposed- to grant one
without bonus or bonds. There art
other available deep water sites in San
Francisco bay and my road will have
a terminus there. Sansalito has lost, a
golden opportunity." " \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'. :^'\
Trustee .W. J. . Martin saidâ "The.
board 13. unanimous on the. bond ques
| tion and a- majority is â¢. in- favor of the
bond and" a bonus. The board \u25a0will never
consider granting the franchise upon
any other consideration. We believe in
progress and Intend to foster it, but
we will not give away franchises for
the asking.".
Trustee Shoemaker said â "If you
give a bond to expend" 520.000 within
one year I am In favor of granting the
franchise without- a bonus."
Trustee Pistolesi saidâ "Once a cor
poration secures a franchise and fails
to fulfill any agreement there is no
hope of recovering It because they will
bitterly fight the revocation."
Evans was handed his proposed ordi
nance and he retired with it. Evans
appeared before the board a month, ago.
The board carefully looked into the
matter and finally, determined that he
was asking for a valuable franchise.but
offering no other guarantee than his
promise that he , would do certain
things.

LIGHT ON PUBLIC OWNERSHIP.
\u25a0^ a N American professor who has made a study of public owner-
Z\ of public utilities in Europe, and especially in the British
* \u25a0 *\u25a0 \u25a0 isles, reports that the system does not appear to be justified
by results, and that the tide is setting; against it. As the tide sub
sides in Europe it appears to be rising here. This occurs in spile
i the fact that our system of government is less adapted to. the suc
cessful administration of such utilities than the European. ] The
change from private to public ownership offers an alluring issue to
politicians, and to that class of agitators who make headway by dis
cussing the known faults of existing methods,, often exaggerating
them, with public ownership as the sole remedy. <
When the subject is discussed in California the proponents of
public ownership have numerous illustrations to quote in favor, of
the change they seek to effect. The leading one is the ownership^
'. by Alameda of its lighting system. We have had occasion hereto
fore to point out that the origin and administration of that system
â¢ was so mixed and mingled with the operation of other public funds
lliat it was impossible, without great labor, to arrive at any definite
conclusion. This complication of accounts and difficulty of making a
. clean balance sheet for the electric lighting was in itself an impeach-!
menl Of public ownership, since such conditions would be impos
sible in a privately owned plant. Business is business, whether in
private or in public hands, and its first requirement is that it shall
be so carried on' as to enable all parties interested to reach a clear
knowledge of its condition. But the shadow of doubt and uncer
tainty has served to enable the advocates of public ownership to
make unfounded claims as to its results in, Alamcda.
It is a feature in the advocacy of public ownership that its pro
ponents substitute prophecy and supposition for facts, and that they
brush aside such infirmities as arc apparent with an* explanation
that "if" such a thing or such other thing "had not happened the
results would be gratifying, and that no\v the difficulty was known
all would be plain and prosperous sailing. This method of treat
ment, abundantly spiced with denunciation of corporations, has
proved sufficient for the maintenance of enthusiasm on the subject.
Now. however, the Alameda case has been expertly probed to the
bottom, and the disclosures made cannot be answered by buoyant
prediction nor flamboyant denunciation.
Mr. L. A. Redman, a citizen of Alameda, determined, with the
assistance of an expert accountant, to find out just how the munici
pal ownership of the electric lighting stood, and to trace, its. effect
upon taxation, and to follow it in all directions, by comparisons of
neighboring systems under private ownership. Eighteen years ago
Alamcda acquired a plant for the electric lighting of its streets
and public buildings, and since 1595 has sold light to the private
consumers of that city. Mr. Redman and his accountant find the
account from the beginning to stand as follows:
Tost of plant, maintenance and construction... ...$189,000
\ alue of light used by city 22Q.300
Present value of plant 58.700
Net loss to taxpayers .$124,100
kJCow for the reason of this difference between this . expert
report and the official reports. The official. reports all assume that
a private corporation would have charged the city $7,50 per arc
light per month for street lights, whereas Oakland and Berkeley are
furnished street lights by a private corporation for 20 and 25 per
cent less than that price. Official reports assume that a private
corporation would have charged for lighting public butltlings 10
P cents per kilowatt, whereas the public buildings of Qakland and
Berkeley are supplied by a private corporation at 5 cents per kilo
watt. The official rej>ort for 1904 assumes that lighting public
â¢ '-buildings for That year would have cost the taxpayers of Alameda, if
supplied by a private corporation $22.0J>7, whereas a private corpora
tion supplied Berkeley with the same amount of lighting for less
than $15,000. It will be seen, then, that in addition to a confusion of
accounts, and to oiticial omission of the items of interest and tie*
preciation of plant, there is official resort to a system of false com-
Sparisons of cost, uruler public and private ownership.
Mr. Redman's paper, which is published in the Alameda Argus
of December 2, is so exhaustive of the subject that its bristling]
points caimot all be'eovered in one review. For the present a state
ment of the effect of public* ownership on public taxation must suf
ticc. The year that Alameda embarked in public ownership tlic tax
rate was 90 cents. In two years it jumped to $1 15. Then after
some fluctuation, to $r 22, and this year was $1 28. Public owner
ship lias been followed by the same increase in taxation there as in
Europe. There are other valuable and instructive lessons T-tn Mr,
Redman's paper which we reserve for future comment.
MISSOURI'S INSURANCE CENSURE.
WD. VAKDIVER, suj>crintendcnt of the insurance depart
ment of Missouri, has written a paper for the December;
â¢ number of The World To-day, about the responsibility of in*
sursnee officials, sn which he does some talking which is as forcible I
Â»s his recent official action â¢ against the companies. Yandiver]
is proud of the moral upheaval that has taken place in his State i
during the last four years. Nineteen boodlers ha\ie there been con- 1
\*icted aiid scmer.ced to the penitentiary, which he states is more j
than in all the previous history of the United Stales put together. It I
seems plain that if Missouri in her present mood of moral strciH
oousness had control of the insurance situation a sweeping reform sn ]
methods would be enforced. '\u25a0;.]
Tl:c siiperir.tcndcnt of insurance does not hesitate to use the
Â«, v ords steal and theft when speaking of the officials of the big New;
York companies using the funds of the policy holders for the pur- i,
we of inmJscÃdng political campaigns and for control of legislative j
jtcts. His ankle was written slionly after it was leanied that the
Mutual life Insurance Company had sent $2500 at one time to aid;
or defeat the passage of measures in the Missouri Legislature. We;
get his paper therefore while his indication is at white heat, *
Vandivcr Is indignant o\-er the tricks of secrecy used in insur-!
ance bookkeeping. He says the element^ concealment is charac-i
teristic cf larceny and embezÂ£lemcntv He points out that while the!
president of one of the Hfe insurance companies was so moral! v tm- 3
developed that he s&id he ihanlced God he had the courage to Â«Â«e
ihe funds of his company for political . pnrposcs : without" .consultin** 1
hts board of directors, he was careful to stealthily conceal the item I
in the b<>ok entries. He say? that se\'Â«ral hundred thousand dollars
of the policy holders* money was taken out by the process of **Â«cecÂ«-I
live orders/ He is quite severe on the artful dodging of expert!
hrtokkeepers. and to such ptrtec*don has this art been carried that hti
thinks mÂ«ch of the exported good from publicity would be balked?
unless this publicity was fully brought out -i by sHlled cross- j

Did She Accept
or Reject Him?
SHE was standing on a Westport
.corner waiting for a car when'he
\u25a0-â¢ stopped to chat with her. The
subject 7 ' of engagements came up.
'A girl friend of mine once had an
awful experience," she said.- ': "Kate had
boon receiving the attentions of a young
man, , whom I'll call Tom. for several
years. Two or three times he had
asked. her to marry him, but she had
withheld her answer.
"One day he .was appointed to a posi
tion in an Eastern city. That night
he called on Kate and asked her again
to marry him.
"1 need a little time to think it
over.*, she said.
'"I leave to-morrow,' said Tom.
"â¢Well, to-morrow night I'll mall you
a letter, giving you my answer,' said
Kate. .. Tom went away and the next
day left the city. Kate thought the
matter, over . until late in the night.
Then che decided upon a plan. She
would -.write 'two letters to Tom, seal
them, address and stamp them. They
would, look i exactly] alike.

Making Work Easy
Angela Morgan
HOW fond we are of wishing we
might be free to work just when
we are in "working mood." and
only then!. How we do dislike to force
ourselves; how we hate struggling to ex
tract the gold from an unlllumined day.
It is the natural protest of tbe human
against circumstances that compel the
exercises of the faculties whether or no
the individual is so inclined. It is the
protest, only too often, of a sluggish
will.
We hear this protest voiced on all sides
of us during the working day. Often,
when moods of heaviness descend upon
us and our tasks refuse to command our
interest, we are guilty of uttering it our
selves.
After all, how unreasonable we are and
how indolent, that we should want our
enthusiasm ready made! We are impa
tient if the working mood does not lit
erally seixe upon us and make an effort
of will unnecessary. Here is where our
trouble liesâ in our disinclination to exer
cise the wilt Here, indeed, is where all
difficulty in character, development lies.
If work can be made easy for us; if
we can enter into it with little or no
consciousness of difficulty, well and good.
But when we must ourselves create the
atmosphere of magic in which effort
grows enjoyable, we rebeL Yet we ex
hibit ignorance and folly by such atti
tude-
How can we expect to "feel like" work
I until we have by our own exertions put
t ourselves in touch with the magical cur
! rents? How can we hope to acquire the
momentum that attunes mind and body
to the required vibration until we have
made effortâ perhaps repeated effort?

Rarely is it that the working mind comes
upon ns unless we invite it by our own
exertions.
The very simplest and easiest way of
capturing: the working mood is to work.
It Is unfortunate there are so many
grumbling workers going about making
theniselves and others miserable by their
difficulties simply because they have not
mastered this secret.
There are innumerable unhappy workers
who make their tasks a grind because of
the mental attitude toward work they as
sume. Grumbling against work; waiting
for. the mood of enjoyment to come; fail
ing to exercise the* will in creating the
liking for workâ aU this keeps one shut
away from the real magic and beauty or
labor. â¢ ' ,
It is when one glories la effort ana
throws himself with abandon into his
tasks that the thrill and the enthusiasm
of the working mood reward him. Wo
may train ourselves daily to do this by
compelling ourselves to work whether wo
"feel. like" it or not, until at length the
mood of magic becomes habitual.
By constantly making effort we put
ourselves in touch with those forces that
make life and work more than worth,
while.
After all, it would be moat unfortunate
If we could have our wish for freedom to>

ASKS SUPREME
COURT FOR AID
SAN JOSE. Dec. 11. â Failing in his
attempt to restrain the Mayor and
Common Council from granting a fifty
year franchise to the San Jose an>l
Santa Clara Street Railroad Company,
by a Superior Court injunction, J. S.;
McGinnis of this city has petitioned
the Supreme Court for a writ of man
date to prevent such action on the
par; of the authorities.
A week ago McGinnis started an ac
tion in Judge Rhodes' department of
t v e Fuix-tlor Court to enjoin the Com
mon Ct uncil from granting the fran
chise. A temporary restraining order
granted was later on dissolÂ» r Â«-l by
.f-idgÂ« Rhodes. As. a sequel to this ac
tion McGinnis has applied to the higher
court. He maintains that the Common
Council has no legal right to grant the
fifty-year franchise until the expira
tion of the present franchise, watch
still has eighteen years to run..
The San Jose and. Santa Clara Rail
road, which is seeking the franchise,
was recently purchased by L. F. Hari
chett of San Francisco, who is said to
represent a coterie oT capitalists head
ed by John Martin. The road runs
from Santa Clara, to Alum Rock Park
a.nd was sold for $650,000.

SITE FOE POWEE-HOUSE
Portion of Block on Seventh
Street Is Purchased for a
Ncav Children's Playground
The prospective delay : in the con
struction of the proposed municipal"
road on Geary street, Point Loboa and
Tenth avenues. which was ; forecasted Jn
last Thursday's \u25a0 Call' became a--, fact
yesterday as the- result of a request
filed by City. Engineer Woodward with
the Board of .Supervisors that the, plaqs
and specifications of the system he had
submitted one week: ago be returned
to him for revision: ' .Woodward's action
compelled the board to rescind its pre
vious resolution inviting bids for. the
construction of the system. on January
2 next, and the plans, were ordered re
turned to him for amendment.
Woodward said that he and J. C. Stut,
who had prepared the plans, had .re
viewed them and it appeared desirable
that certain changes bo made before
bids are received. One objection is that
the track gauge of the . extension on
Tenth avenue differs from that of the
main line. \u25a0 ; *. '. -
The resolutions authorizing the pay
ment .of $200,000 to the owners of the
lot on Seventh street, between Harrison
and Bryant, for a children's playground
were finally passed;
Similar action was taken on the
bills authorizing, the payment of $15,
167 13 to Mrs. E. Cutter and $2500 to-
Adolph Meyer for the lots purchased
as a site for the car and power house
of the city's Geary street road.
The board ordered the payment of
$57,500 to John Fay for a lot at the
corner of Chestnut and Mason streets,
forming part of the North Beach chil
dren's . playground.
The Southern Pacific Company fwas
granted a permit to use, in common
with the Santa Fe Company, : spur
tracks on Sixteenth, Eighth, Fifteenth
and Rhode Island streets and to lay a
small spur to connect therewith on
Seventh and Sixteenth streets.
Permits for spur tracks were
granted to the Haslett Company on
â¢King street, between Second and Third;
the Pacific Cereal Association on Mason,
Taylor and North Point streets, and to
Somers & Co. on Sixth street, near Hub
bell.
Grades were ordered established at
points on Twenty-second, Twenty-third,
Twenty-fourth, Twenty-fifth, Twenty
sixth, Twenty-seventh. Twenty-eighth,
Twenty-ninth, Thirty-first aud Thirty
second avenues South, and H, I and J
streets South.
1 The board accepted the offer of
Charles Dickman to sell for $3500 a
lot at the corner of Kearny and Chest
nut streets for the preservation |of
Telegraph Hill.
Appropriations were made to con
struct sidewalks in front of the Haight
and Hawthorne schools.
The roadways of Elizabeth street, be
tween Guerrero and San Jose avenue;
York street, between Twenty-fourth
and Twenty-fifth; . Clinton Park,
between .Gjierrero and Dolores; Fred
erick street, between Buena' Vista and
Masonic avenues, and Broderick street,
between Broadway and Pacific street,
were accepted.
The Finance Committee finally de
cided to pay bills for $910 for auto
mobiles hired by the Department of
Elections. The bills had been criticized
because of the apparently excessive
charges.
The board rejected the petition of
the United Railroads for the refunding
of taxes paid under the levies made for
bond redemption and interest funds, ex
cept in the case/>f so much of said peti-t
tion as prays for the refunding of
$1458 47, Dald for the Telegraph Hill
Park bond redemption and interest
funds, which levy was declared invalid
by the Supreme Court The City At
torney was asked for an opinion as
to whether the board has the legal
right to return the taxes in the amount
named. ,
The Finance Committee directed Ex

BELOW REGULATION
It Is Said That Permit for
Them Was Granted in Spite
:di Eeport of John K.
Bulger, Who Disapproved
Henry Weber and James M. Spencer,
the captain and the engineer of the oil
tank steamer Despatch, were arrested
yesterday afternoon and booked at the
City Prison, but each ;; was released on
cash bail. The Despatch blew/ up last
Friday while four young boys were in
side its boilers scaling; rust, and one
of them, "Jimmy; Mitchell, was killed.
Labor Commissioner Walter V. Stafford
and District Attorney Byington lost no
time in starting the wheels of justice,
and yesterday warrants were sworn out
against the engineer; and the master,
supposed to be responsible for' y the
hiring of minors for the dangerous
duty In /-violation of sections 272 and
273 of the Penal Code.', There were six
warrants against Engineer .Spencer and
one against Captain Weber. : They de
posited $100 cash for each charge. Both
men paid in bright twenty-dollar pieces
that looked like the savings of -.-many
years of sea life. .. *'\u25a0 V, -~,
But this may prove to be only a be
ginning. Assistant District Attorney J.
J. Greely will study to-morrow the
question whether a charge of man"-*
slaughter does not lie ! against \Captain
Weber, and the master of the ship tliati
employs small boys to wqrk among
leaking oil tanks may find himself in
serious predicament.
PASS TH^ RESPONSIBILITY.
When booked at the City Prison the
two men seemed to feel deeply their,
serious position. Captain ".Weber 1 is a
little, grizzled man .with ;?short, thick
hands, roughened with/many, years of
sea labor, and blue eyes that are, kindly.
He was excited and his voice had tears
in It. He said, "I, am innocent as a
child. v I had nothing to do with hiring
the little fellows. I leave those thing 3
to the engineer. Just because I nm
captain I am responsible for everything
that everybody does on Â» the ship."
Spencer, who is dark and towers above
his little captain, also felt aggrieved.
He said that It was a general custom
to hire boys for the cleaning of boilers,
as men could not twist easily about in
the confined space. He disclaimed hav
ing had anything to do with the hiring
of the, boys. " "I was ordered by â¢ the in
spectors to clean the boilers and let
our, agents, ( George D. Gray. & Co., 1 hire
thef boys'thaV l needed.",* ..",-" \u0084 \-\u25a0â¢\u25a0\u25a0.\ -\u25a0â¢\u25a0\u25a0.
John K. | Bulger, Inspector : of : Boilers
and Hulls/has been charged by Super
vising Inspector John Bermlngham 1 to
make a thorough j Inquest , into . the cause
of the explosion on""the, Despatch. Bulger
thinks that there may, have been another
cause foi the explosion than .weakness. of
the tanks. The tanks were filled through
a large funnel on deck," \ and it may be
that. too rapid a pouring of the oil caused
the 'overfiow; into the hold, : and, besides,
the straining of the tanks. There is an
other theory to be investigated. Engineer
Spencer claims that the carpenter of the
ship while propping up the gangway let
fall a heavy board against one of the
valves of the tank. The valve, upon
which there was a pressure of forty-five
pounds, was knocked off and a stream of
oil, gushing out like the water from a
fire hose, struck the fires of the boilers,
immediately causing the explosion.
.QUESTION AS TO^TANKS.
' Whatever the . cause of ihe explosion,
there is little doubt that the ship was, In
bad condition^ ; Assistant Inspector Joseph
P. Dolan, who inspected her on Friday
a few ' hours before the explosion, says
that the fumes of oil in the aft port tank
were so powerful that . he had f to clear
out." There were leaks of oil in various
places. " The valves were loose and the
seams needed to, be calked. The rivets
also showed signs of leaking and the
heads of the tanks .were bu.ged.
As regards the strength of the tanks, a
queer story is being whispered at the Ap
praiser's building. $It seems that when
the tanks were put in, in 1902, Inspector
Bulger disapproved of them; butin some
manner license to put them in was grant
ed the owners from the Treasury Depart
ment at Washington. : The ; tanks are only
a quarter of an inch thick, while the rules
of the ! lnspector's' office require; a thick-;
ness of ; five-eighths ,; of an inch. ; When
asked lif he i had disapproved of the tanks
in 1902 and if the ' license : had been given
over his disapproval Inspector Bulger was
reticent. v He; admitted that , the \, tanks
were below the thickness now- required.
John Bermlngham; \u25a0 'chief g of -.the /in
spectors'office andjÃulger's superior, was
asked if it were possible ; that he would
indorse lan - ; application to { put "; in I tanks
"disapproved of ,by, lnspector 'Bulger. He
a nswered, "I ; act according to ; my. inspec
tors''reports.", :A ; isearch. amongithe :of
flce; records \u25a0 for the report of Bulger was
unsuccessful. : .The i only \u25a0 document j seem
ingly In existence as regards the Despatch
wasthe. application -of the owners, to put
in the oil tanks. \ This holds Mr. Berming
ham's signature of approval.-. Mr.\'-.Ber
mingham - thea said that the : application
had ;.been ...granted;: without inspection
merely jon the , blue-print plans furnished
by \u25a0 the : owners. But < other people 1 at the

a special-bill presented, which, if 'passed,

It has ; become known that Merri wether
-was acquitted on the. charge- of man

fringements of the rules and regulations
of the naval academy, which are of suffi

The case now is in the hands of the Sec
retary of the Navy, who probably will
reach his conclusions within a few days,
It is quite possible that Merriwether. may
be allowed to stay at- Annapolis, but' 'll
that course of action is 'followed by the
authorities he undoubtedly will be giver

BROWN'S LAST
RACE IS RUN
Grim Reaper Overtakes the
Noted Millionaire Horse
man at Pittsburg; Home
CONSCIOUS TO THE END
Starts to Erect a Handsome
Church to Mothers Memo
ry, but Never Sees It Built
Special Dispatch to The Call
PITTSBURG. Dec. 31.â Captain Samuel
6. Brown, the noted turfman and multi
millionaire, died this morning after a
long illness here. Cancer of the stomach
was the cause of death. He was 63 ;
yean of agv, having been born in Pitts
burs September 15, 1542.
Captain Brown had fought death for
months, hoping against hope to see the
fulfillment cf a plan to build a $75,000
church in memory of his mother. Years
apo he conceived the idea of giving- his
old friends and neighbors a place to
worship and he erected what is known
or the- Mary Brown Memorial Chapel
v.ithin half a mile of his home on Squirrel
JIUI. He ordered all bills of ministers,
etc.. pent to him and about one year ago
fcp conceived the idea of building a church
alongside the MÂ«*xnorelal Chapel, and he
went out to have the plans drawn.
Months aeo, when told by his physi
cian? that he could not live long, he sent
a harried call to hie architects and con
tractors and asked them to hurry with
the work. ?s he wanted to Bee the church
finished before he died. D?ath won the
race, as he pat in hi? chair at 9:25 a. m.
to-day, as the church Is not finished. It
is understood, however. that Captain
Brown has set aside $75,000 of his means
to fini'h the church.
Captain Brown is said to have been
worth $15,000,000 at the time of his death. \u25a0
Boom time ago he uifposed of his Im
mense holdings in horseflesh.
rears ago he heard that Bob Tucker,
his trainer, was broke and went to Chi
c.ifto to see him. He gave him a hard
lecture and loaned him SlOOO and some
pood sidvice. Tucker is said to be worth
5150,000 now. Ke Is said to have never
Jirod a jockey outright but onceâ that
Â«f George Odom at Saratoga, when the
rider sot a bad start on Broomstick and
lost *.he race which Brown seemed to
have had at his mercy. He let Odom go
that night, saying only: "George, you
were carelcrs if nothing worse."
Captain Brown was conscious almost to
the last. He conversed with friends
about hi? coming end and named four
ministers whom he wanted at his funeral.
He was an immense owner of real estate
1n Pittsburg. was sole owner of the Brown
Hoisting Machine Company, a director in
ihe I'nion Trust Company and the First
National Bank of Pittsburg, besides a
heavy stockholder in several Southern
concerns. Until a few jears ago he was
the heaviest coal shipper between Pitts
burg arid New Orleans. He sold out his
holdings to the river combine.
(UN CLUB AROUSES
WRATH OF FARMERS
SANTA AN*A. Dec. 11.â Four hundred
ranchers of the Westminster district, in
the southwest corner of Orange County,
forwarded a petition to President Roose
velt to-cl3y asking for an investigation
into the appropriation of the waters of
Bolsa Chica Bay by the Bolsa Chica Gun
Club as a duck-?hooting preserve. The
petition recites the fact that the club
has bui!t a dam across the bay, rendering
the navigable Inlet useless for any pur
pose. After stating the history of the
Bo'.sa Chica Gun Club and the case.
whirh extends over the last four years,
the petition concludes with an appeal to
tha President to have the laws of the
"War Department in regard to navigable
strrarr.p rr.forced. adding that all officials
thus far appealed to, from the Collector
of Customs at San Pedro to the Secretary
<;f War, have neglected, failed and re
frscd to enforce the laws. The ranchers
have been making an unsuccessful fight
for four years to have the gun club's dam
across the bay removed.

FOR COIN AXD-XUGGET
KOGALES, Ariz.. Dec. 11.â Saturday
forenoon while H. Gordon Glore, a Cali
fornia metallurgist, was making an ex
amination of the Veta Tlerra placer mine,'
near the Guadalupe Mountains, six miles
from Llano, Sonora. Mexico, he discov
ered the decomposed body of a man in an
old shaft. By the gold teeth it was posi
tively as that of Luther H.
Jewell, a mining man and brother of
Colonel Fred Jewell, a San Diego banker,
who was last seen at Magdalena, Sonora,
on May 2. It was supposed he was mur
dered for his money and a gold nugget
worth $500. Colonel Jewell \u25a0 offered a re
ward of $500 for hie missing brother.
SAN DIEXSO, Dec. 11.â Colonel Fred
Jewell, whose brother's remains are said
to have been found and identified near
Llano. Mexico, has instructed M. E. Hop
pood and a former employe of Luther
Jewell to go to Llano for the purpose of
making an Identification. If the identity
is established the body wilj. be burled in
Mexico. Colonel Jewell cays if doubt ex
ists he himself will go to Llano, although
his life has been threatened if he should
return to Mexico.
After Colonel Jewell's former visit to
that country in, an effort to find his broth
er, during: which he expressed his convic
tion of foul play, one of the Mexican of
ficials was recalled, and it is understood
his friends threatened Colonel Jewell's
life. ,

Lone Wolf Takes
Opening Event
on Card
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
With streamers representing the colors
of as many different owners floating over
the stables, weather Ideal for racing pur-,
poses and a large attendance present, In- â¢
gleside track, the handsome course nestled j
among the hills of the city's suburbs, ,
opened its gates to the public again yes- i
terday. The painter, the gardener and
the carpenter had been busy for days,
until the favorite track looked almos^ as
beautiful as on the day it opened. Owing i
to the fact that many of the owners I
were still in a topsy-turvy state from
moving their horses and belongings over '
the bay the card itself was not above j
mediocrity. However, It answered all
purposes, and the sport was thoroughly j
enjoyed. Upsets were frequent, San Pri
mo being the one favorite | to come
through.
With anything like an even ride An- .
gelica, the 8 to 5 favorite, could scarcely!
have lost the introductory seven-furlong
selling number. Lloyd Fountain got into
all sorts of difficulties with the mare,
and at the wire was easily beaten by
Lone. Wolf, a 6 to 1 chance, ridden by
Rice. Knapp landed In the show with
Rose Eley, a 20 to 1 shot.
Although she had stopped after nego
tiating about five furlongs in races run at
Oakland, the wise ones thought that a
change of tracks, might prove beneficial
to Jillette. Louis Ezell's overworked
filly was therefore installed first choice |
for the two-year-old* sprint. She collared
Bakersfield entering the stretch and then,
after leading an eighth, faltered and fell
back. In a furious drive Herbert, astride
the 10 to 1 shot Iron Watson, earned a
neck decision over Itamus, the second
choice, both coming from the rear divi
sion. Tom Roberts ran third.
After a long spell on the schooling
list, Yo San from the stable of Hume &
Co., celebrated her release by leaving
behind her a highly educated cluster of
speed in the all-aged five and a half
furlong dash. Gossiper, the mount of
Radtke, enjoyed first call in the ring,
and the filly should have been retuitned
a winner. Adams got away in front
with Yo San and in a driving finish
kept his mount going just long enough
to down the favorite a head. Baldwin's
Ksckmado only lost the place by a
nose. â¢ .'-\u25a0'. \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 . ,
Radtke took the mile and fifty yard
selling run with San Primo, the Kneene
! entry. The Bassetlaw gelding, a 17 to 10
favorite, possessed all the speed of the
party," and won all the way. Christine
A, a 90-pounder, played from threes
down to 11 to 5, ran second, five lengths
before Gateway.
Much adverse criticism- was evoked
through the handling of Blumenthal by
Louis Ezell's apprentice, Barrett. After
T. Sullivin, on the favorite Titus, had
become becalmed, it looked in the
stretch as if Blumenthal would roll
home first.
Then Barrett began going down after
wraps, and at the mile Leroy Williams
earned a neck verdict with The Lieu
tenant, a 11 to 1 outsider. The show
went to Bonnie Reg.
The Sierra Nevada stables' smart
filly, Neva Lee, met Corn Blossom on
nearly equal terms in the final seven
furlong purse number, and she romped
in ahead* of the Powell entry. The
latter ruled favorite but did not appear
to get fully into his stride until the
race was over. Neva had C. Miller in
the saddle and after she had raced
Judge to a standstill, drew away and
won in a gallop. Six lengths back the
first choice defeated Beau Ormonde a
couple of lengths for the place.

RECORD AUTO
ARRIVES HERE
"White Flier," Which Broke
the World's Record for a
Mile, Now on Exhibition
WILL RACE ON COAST
A. H. Piepenburg Engaged
to Drive the Car That Made
Webb Jay's Name Famous
The noted White track racer, the fastest
automobile that ever went around a cir
cular "course, arrived in this city from
New York yesterday. The machine is
built on the "low rakish plan," its body
being but four inches from the ground.
It is constructed of aluminum, and is
fitted with a regulation fifteen horsepower
engine, which, however, generates twenty
horsepower with the aid of 'the great
radiator.
The car is known as the "White flier,"
and it was in it that Webb Jay made the
world's record for a mile by going over
the distance in 48 3-3 seconds on a circular
track last July at Morris Park race track,
cutting off 4 4-5 seconds from Schevo
rolet's record. .
The machine had won a number of
cups. Including the Morris cup, by de
feating the French champion, and Barney
Oldfield, the Diamond cup and later the
National Circuit championship prize. So
far the machine has never been defeated
on a circular track.
The flier is fresh from the repair 6hop.
The last time it was driven by Jay. at
Buffalo last summer, it swerved from the
track, plunged over an embankment and
landed In a pond of water ninety feet
away. Jay had a marvelous escape from
instant death. The machine was badly
damaged, and it took a great deal of
work to put It in shape again.
The flier will be seen all over the Pa
cific Coast. Just as soon as dates can be
arranged A. H. Piepenburg will drive it
over the Ingleside or Tanforan track.
From this city it will go to San Jose.
Fresno, Stockton and Los Angeles, and
thence to the Northwest and British
Columbia before being shipped East for
the spring and summer race meets.

be different.

ciation, which was established a little
over a year ago. is now a prosperous
athletic organization, with a member
ship of about 150. The drilling and
callsthenlc exercises which they per

interest is being taken by the women
of this city in athletics.

by wrestlers and boxera. The Young
Men's Christian Association sent sev

CALLS KOREANS
DIRTY AND LAZY
H. E. Bostwick Describes a
People Whose Goveniment
Is "Corrupt and Eotten v
WOED "SQUEEZE^ KNOWN
Olticials Practice System
Without Conscience on the
Long - Suftering Public
,- . Some of the- characteristics of the
Koreans were revealed to the Presby
terian ministers yesterday at their
weekly meeting at 920 Sacramento
street by H. E. Bostwick, a much trav r
eled'man in the Orient.
In telling of some of the difficulties
in .Korea, : he .said that as early; as last
March there was a probability of the
Japanese taking control of the "so
called Korean Government."
Bostwick paid the Japanese a high
compliment; when, in making a com
parison, he . gave .them the credit of
being clean, enterprising- and Indus
trious. The Korean, on the other hand,
said the speaker, is dirty, lazy and a
sort of impossible being. But, he
asked, why, should the Korean not bo
so, with a "corrupt, rotten Government
over him these long centuries." ' '
"Then Bostwick made known to his
audience that the word "graft" is un
known in Korea, but the word
/"squeeze" ;is familiar and 'is practiced
most effectively on the; long-suffering
people.
PKOPLE MAY HAVE CHANCE.
The missionaries out there, he said,
have hoped all this will be changed and
the: people : have a chance. So far the
methods employed by the- Japanese in
the getting of power and control were
causing their missionaries the greatest
anxiety.
It is a new thing, indeed, in history,
he said, one Asiatic nation seeking to
transform and civilize another and to
do it wisely and well. To build up,,
instead of tearing down, will require
special tact,: he said.
Bostwick declared his belief that the
leading Japanese are governed by good
motives, but the hordes of \u25a0 their own
people pouring into the country look
down upon the KoVeans and treat them
shamefully.
The Rev. H. W. Luce of Wei Hsien,
Central Shantung Province, China, pro
fessor for eight years in Union College
of that place, was introduced to the
meeting and spoke on missionary work
in China.
The Rev. George C. Adams, D. D.,
pastor of the First Congregational
Church, spoke on the subject of "Peace
Makers" before the Methodist preach
ers' meeting: at the Central Methodist
Episcopal Church, Mission street, yes
terday. . .
The doctor held that the late Gen
eral G6rdon, though a' warrior, \u25a0 was
really a peacemaker. He pictured the
general's putting down the Yaiping re
bellion in China and also his work in
the Soudan, where he finally lost his
life. * ' ,
Dr..Adams then spoke of President
Roosevelt 'as a peacemaker. He em
phasized the -"surprise element" in the
President's character.
The general prediction when Roose
velt came into the Presidential chair
was that he would embroil the country
in war, the speaker said. Instead He
has achieved his highest, fame as a
peacemaker.
CHIUSTIAX CHURCH PASTOR.
"Historic Christ and Eternal Christ"
was the subject of an address yesterday
by the Rev. Dr. .Buckham before the
Congregational Ministers' Union. Dr.
Buckham is professor of theology at
the Pacific Theological Seminary,
Berkeley. \u25a0 .
The members of the Christian Church
of San Francisco and across the bay
had been wondering who will be called
to:, succeed the Rev.; Walter Madison
White, the esteemed, pastor of West
Side Christian Church, this city. Yes-*
terday. it was learned that the Rev.
Robert Lord Cave of Clarksville, Term.,
had been called to fill the position re
signed by the Rev.. Mr. White on ac
count of his joining Kentucky Univer
sity... \u25a0 ;, -. \u25a0''\u25a0.-'-\u25a0 V "-T A
. The Rev. Mr. Cave is the grandson of
the late Rev.. W. H." Hopson, who. yll
the hour of "his death, was one of the
foremost ministers of the Christian
body. Mr. Cave Is a cousin of i the Rev.
Dr. E.iL. : Powell of the American Mis
gionary' Society, who presided at the
great convention of the Christian
Church in San Francisco last summer,
and is pastor of the First Christian
Church, Louisville, Ky.
No Longer ; a Citizen.
Erick Kokeritz suffered the loss of
his citizenship \ papers in Judge Heb- ;
bard's : Court yesterday. He is master
of the American ship Star of France.
He came here on July ; 13, 1897, and was
fraudulently naturalized the' following

Service "Agent .Helms /informing the
court I that the United States Govern
ment had noobjections to his admission
to citizenship, he g; having ;' = been here
more than " five : years.' Later, however.
Secret Service Agent Taylor discovered
that he had never declared his intention
to" become a citizen,' so, his papers were
again revoked yesterday. V In canceling
the papers Judge; Hebbard said that In
his opinion* Kokeritz and | his \ witnesses
were guilty "ot ! perjury.! when they se

TWO MEN HURT
BY EXPLOSION
Breaking of an Incandescent
Lamp in Santa Bosa Light
ing- Plant Causes Disaster
BUILDING IS DAMAGED
Engineer and Another Work
man Seriously 'Burned by
Flames Sent to Hospital
Saecial Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Dec. 11.â While working
about the "scrubber" Engineer . Charles
T; Ferguson of the Santa. Rosa Lighting
Company was seriously, if not fat^ly.
burned about the head, shoulders and
arms by the explosion of gas which fol
lowed the breaking of an Incandescent
lamp to-day. He was standing on a lad
der about thirty feet from the ground,
when the explosion occurred, and was
thrown backward, falling into a cement
pit filled with gaseous water. He was
quickly pulled put and hurried to a hos
pital. All the hair of his head was burned
off, as was his mustache.
The explosion blew out the end of the
building and threw the boards for some
distance. .W. B. Haynie I who was work
ing near by was burned about the head,
and it is believed that he breathed some
of the flame. Both men lost considerable
cuticle, and it will be some weeks before
they will be able to resume work.
Administratrix Commended.
The petition of John Louis McKinnon,
backed by Nagle & Nagle. for the re
moval of Leonide M.'McKinnon, as ad
ministratrix of the estate of the late
John J. McKinnon, has been denied by-
Judge Troutt. The petitioner accused
the administratrix and her attorneys.
Lent & Humphrey, of misuse of the
properties of the -estate. Judge Troutt
held that the charges were not well
founded. "The evidence shows," said
Judge Troutt, "that the administratrix
and her counsel have been unusually
diligent in conserving the properties of
the estate and their every act has
shown good faith." The petition was
then denied. ,

ADVERTISEMENTS. O
It must be confessed that with all
our beautiful weather and in spite of
our wonderful and salubrious climate \u25a0
there Is lots of Rheumatism in and
around San Francisco. It's a bad kind
of Rheumatism, too, for our family-
doctors and our vaunted rheumatic
remedies, in most cases, do little or no
groocl. Now, I was a sufferer from
Rheumatism for a long time, but 1 '
grinned and bore it. I had to â for
medicines did not help It. That was all
very well until the Rheumatism begun
to settle around my heart and cut off
my wind; then I knew that 3omethlns
had to be done, and that quickly. So,
fortunately for me. I had heard of the
Electro-Chemlc treatment, and I toolt
the Klectro-Chemlc course. It cured me
quickly and at a small expense. I have
recommended a good many of my
neighbors and friends to the Institute
and it has cured them. Now I recom-
mend it to everybody. I am a pioneer.
I am well known. I believe every one
who knows me gives me credit for be-
ing a man of my. word. I was postmas-
ter at my home. Colma. for fourteen
year 3, also notary public. I am too old
to begin prevaricating now, and any
sufferer who may happen upon this
statement may believe every word of It
implicitly, and, if further proof Is nec-
essary, come out and see me. JACOB .
BRYAX, Colma. California. It Is only a
little ride, and everybody knows me.
The Electro-Chemic Institute i 3 now
located on the third floor of the Emma.
Spreckels building, 927 Market street.
It was formerly at 118 Grant avenue. I
can conscientiously recommend any
sufferer to the Institute because I know
that every one will be given a most
careful examination and will be told the
truth. If the case is beyond help the
Electro-Chemic physicians will tell the
sufferer honestly just what can and
\u25a0what can not be done, and such advice
and the consultation and examination
are free to all.

NEW YORK. Doc. 11.â The stock market re
rrainod un.icr ready control of thÂ© speculative
organization to-day, and thfnre was no apparent !
difficulty in continuing ins vigorous advance
in prices ov*n in the face of offerings that
looked formidable. There was no radical
change la easditloÃa from tho^e ruling last
week. The stnnj?en<y in the money market
Â»asÂ« somewhat relaxed, but was by no meanf ,

mon*y market to. weather tne turn of the yoar ;
w ithout some further convulsive activity in the
deputmect of loans for *f]xx?ulatlve purposes.
The rei-eiÂ«ion of speculative attention to the
â¢taaiiardl railroad stocks remrorced the feeMng
of \u25a0 \u25a0 :.:;.Â» !.(\u25a0â¢ over tlie Eixrculation. Attemt'ts

market disciosed some ditflculty in making that

in the stock. But as nften as it gathered for**
"or a new advance the reassuring effect on tbe
market was quite iÂ«?rceputile. St. Paul Irejit
effective company with I'nion Pacific and
t -utliPrn Picific also showed a naturally close
sympathy. Oilier Western and grain carrying
Btoefes moved more modet-awly In Â«pfte of the
g..od promis* of tbe winder wheat crop con
tained in the Government* monthly report.
There were no epecia.l newÂ« features to account ,
tor thr movement in Union Paciac. The specu
lative advanre in Reading was aggressively re
i.ewed. also with uvu. 1. ruade of the discutsicn
of the labor outlook and expressed coirfidence In
its adjustment. The etrenrtn in New York
Contra! was attributed especially to the fact |
that a dividend and rights are to come off the ',
price at an early date. Copper stocks of all
trades were v*-ry prominent in the day's specu

Â«-urb market. Â«ome of them, including Amal
framated Copper, reflecting- verj* heavy profit

report of a further advance- is copper, but
closed unchanged. The market for the metal

Steel stocks were persistently sluggish until
Jate in th* day, but their belated advance was
rffecttve in FU^taining the late market. The

Sfew York Cotton Mnrket.
XEW YORK. Dec. 11.â Tne Irregularity and
heaviness which the cotton market displayed
to-day was due principally to â¢ a continuation
of the selling- movement which : brokr out at
th** . close of .lÂ»st week. . on the bearish snow- ;
Ing of the glnners' report,. as. contrasted with
thfe figures ginned in the years of 190!f and
lÂ»02. .These comparisons .mako the crop. larger
than Ihi Government's estimated total yield of
10.167.0UJ tares, as 5.651.Q00 ~ bales. ,* or, ..the
standard clre were . reported ginned to ' Decem
ber'l In Thursday's rrport of -the' United
Ftaies Census Bureau, against 5.C20.244 in
1903. when the crop was 10; 000, 000 bales, and !
as contrasted with 8.905,503 to December \u25a0 15, !
In liKKt, when the crop .was over .10,500,000
bales. From theÂ«e comparisons It is to be : ex- ".
pected that -the next ginnln< report, due at
the end of this month, will show considerably
more than 9.000,000 bales ginned to December
13, which will make the comparison ' then with'
! this year's appear more- striking. ; A'" good deal.
1 Â©f ' the selling , on' to-day's market was Influ
enced by these developments. The bulls ren
dered strong, support during midday , and re-
covered all but a -few-points of the early de
cline of fifteen points,- but the selling broke out
afresh in the later trading in the lead of an
other aexrcÃsU'e bear, attack. ,--:;â¢\u25a0

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and "Provisions.
; CHICAGO, Dec. 11. â Tbe wheat marketjwod
I firm for the greater part of the day. At the
1 cpenlnK the May delivery, was up %@Victo
: Â»teat 69iiS9J^c to SÂ»^c. The initial firmness
? \vas ciue chlc-fly to an advance In the. price ot
I wheat at Liverpool. For n. time shorts were
j fairly active bidders and the price of May rose
jto $93v.c. Unconfirmed reports of damage by
1 rain to ihfe Argentine crop encouraged buying
lon the local board. In anticipation of the pub
lication of the Government crop report, which
was generally expected to be bearish, there
was considerable selling by ptt traders. This
produced a temporary reaction, during which
, the May option sold off to RS%Â®BSÂ»ie. Ac
! cording to official statistics, the condition of
i fall sown wheat is 94.1, compared with 52.9
iat the corresponding time one year ago. The
1 effect of, this report was quickly dispelled by
i the announcement of alar^e decrease In the
J visible supply of wheat, the available etocka
I being reduced 2,232,000 bushels during thÂ«
j week, asralnst an increase of 218,000 bushels
I for the corresponding week of last year. The*?
! figures produced ' a firm ..feeling, which con
t tlnued until the close. Demand by commission
â¢ houees and shorts carried the price of May up
to 89 % Â©89'. 5 c. The market 'closed firm, with
1 May at 89< B aS9Uc.
1 Because of an Improvement In the car short
age situation which will enable the new corn
crop to reach market' more promptly, there
vas heavy selling of I corn to-day. May closed
j easy, y t c"lower, at 44% c.
i " Oats opened weak in sympathy with corn,
\u25a0but firmed up In sympathy with wheat. May
closed \Uc up 32 ! 5iia32T;c.
; The provisions market was weak, except the
' nearby delivery of lard, which ruled fairly
strong. At the clone . May. pork was off 12%ffj

. ThÂ» market for fresh fruits opened the week
with trade of good proportions, . notably in
Navel Oranges,', the demand for which showed
.considerable improvement. - Buyers were run
ning more oxl thÂ« size than quality, large
sizes of all grades- being In good demand at
steady prices, while small fruit, irrespective
of quality, was neglected. The receipts over
Sunday were 7 care, two of which were in
transit for Australia. Tangerines were abun
dant and lower and small Grape Fruit was
very dull.'. Seedling Oranges. Mandarins and
Mexican Limes were .In good request and
steady. Â» Fancy Apples moved freely at well
maintained'prices, Newtown Pippins, Bell
flowers and Spltzenbergs being . the best sell
er*. Stocks of Grapes consisted almost I en
tirely of carried-over stock, which met with
very little call.- and prices were wholly nom
inal. I The low prices of Strawberries have ap
parently checked the movement from near-by
districts. Yesterday's arrivals* were less than
'four chests and â¢ they were held at higher
prices, but found' few takers. A crate con
taining ; 30 baskets of the Malinda variety
came in from Santa Barbara and &old at 12% c
per basket. There was nothing new to report
In other lines, except that Pineapples were

OVERHEAD
TROLLEY IS
VOTED DOWN
Board of Supervisors Denie3
Petition of United Rail
roads for Wires on Polk,
Sutter and Ninth Streets
3IEMBERS STEADFAST
FOR UNDERGROUND
Believe That Former Per
mits Have Been Granted
Without Thought bf Beau
tifying San Francisco
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
formally adopted the report of the
Joint committee on Streets and
Finance, recommending that the peti
tion of the United Railroads for per
mission to change its Sutter. Polk.
Larkln and Ninth street systems from
s cable road to an overhead trolley
system be denied. The vote on the
adoption of the report was unanimous.
Erandsnetein explained that he voted
eye In deference to the fact that 75
per cent of the interested property
owners had protested against the
overhead system on the streets
named. Brandenstein held that the
objection that the system would be a
disfigurement of the streets and dan
gerous to life is not a serious one and
this city is giving a superb example
of "fossillsm" and "non-progressive
ness" by not favoring the overhead
system such as the United Railroads
Intended to construct.
Supervisor Connor called attention
to the clause in the report that' re
quests the chairman of the joint com
mittee to arrange for a meeting of the
representatives cf the United Rail
roads and those of the Sutter-street
Improvement Club, with the purpose
In view of coming' to some amicable
agreement In regrard to an Improved
street railroad for the systems. Con
nor said he hoped the - United Rail
roads would some day see its way
clear to install a uniform underground
syeteM in this city and that former
board* had made mistakes In granting
permits for overhead systems. Super
visor D"A.ncona, who presided at the
meeting of the board in the absence
of the Mayor, said that the adoption
of the report committed the board to
the underground conduit system.
The board passed to print an ordi
nance providing that' bids be Invited
on Monday, January 8. 1906. for the
purchase of municipal bonds to the
amount of J324.000 for street improve
ments.
The board adopted the usual resolu
tions preparatory to the fixing of
water rates and calling on the Spring
Valley Water Company and other cor
porations to furnish detailed financial
statements showing their receipts and
expenditures; also an inventory of the
properties actually used in supplying:
water. The Board of Works is -direct
ed to make an apralsement of the
properties.
The amended ordinance requiring
persons who desire to Act as drivers or
motormen of vehicles, automobiles,
motor care or tallyhos to pay a license
tax of th per annum, to secure a per
mit from the Police Commission and to
\u25a0wear a badge to be issued by the Tax
Collector, was passed to print.

CURED BY CUTICURA
IN TWO WEEKS FOR 75c.
Mrs. George J. Steese, of 701 Coburn
St., Akron, Ohio, tells in the following
letter of another of those remarkable
cures of torturing, disfiguring skin
humort daily made by Cuticura Soap,
assisted by Cuticura Ointment, after
physicians, and all else had failed: "I
feel It my duty to parents of other poor
suffering babies to tell you what Cuti-
cura has done for my little daughter.
She broke out all over her body with a
humor, and we used everything recom-
mended, but without results. I called
in three doctors, they all claimed they
could help her, but she continued to
grow worse. Her body was a mass of
eorea, and her little face wae being
eaten away; her e&rs looked aa if they
would drop off. Neighbors advised me
to get Cuticura Soap and Ointment, and
before I had used naif of the cake of
eoap ana box of ointment the sores had
all healed, and my little one's face and
body were as clear as a new-bom babe's.
I would not be without it again if it
coet five dollars, instead of seven ty-flve
ceate, which is all it cost us to* cure
our baby, after spending many dollars
on doctors and medicines without any
benefit whatever."

LOOKS SERIOUS
FOR COLLINS
Witnesses Admit $hat De
fendant Is Source of Infor
mation About Dead Wife
LAWYERS IN A WRANGLE
McPike Objects to District
Attorney's Interviewing
Attestants for Defense
The fabric raised by Geoifce D. Collins
in his opening statement, indicating the
line of his defense against '^he charge of
perjury, showed signs of w;.ar yesterday
afternoon, after a strenuous attack by
the attorneys for the pros'*?utlon. Col
lins, v.'ho recently said he fifty wit
nesses, was able to summcA but" half a
dozen yesterday and the of
these did not g'o'far to substantiate his
opening- statement. It appears that
Collins will reply largely* on his own
testimony to refute#the chseVge and that
the case may go to the JurY wlthin'the
week. \u25a0
Several heated arguments took place
between the opposing cÂ«un^el yesterday,
and the exhibitions of* both sides ap^
proached absurdity. Judge Lennon!
whose patience Is sorely tried at time 3,
admon-.shed' both prosecution and defense.
The arguments themselves were brought
about by the attempt of the District At
torney to get certain testimony into the
record. This testimony involves Â«the re
fusal of Collins to permit Caarlotta Col
lins to testify.
Collins, although having v, short rest
of two days, appeared palis and worn.
He haa lost much of the jauntiness that
characterized him at the beginning of the
trial, and several limes during the testi
mony yesterday he sat back listlessly in
his chair, with a dejected look upon his
fiec.
The witnesses called by Collins, while
giving in the main their teetimony for the
defendant, were several times forced to
admit certain salient points of benefit to
the prosecution. All but one testified
that the source of their knowledge that
Agnes Newman Collins was the wife of
the defendant was from the lips of Col
lins.
UNDERTAKER TESTIFIES.
The first witness called by the defense
was Alfrtd D. Cheshire, who was \u25a0 the
undertaker that called at Collins' house
to take charge of the bodies of 'Agnes
Collins and the child, Busan Collins. By
ington objected to the opening Question
regarding the death of Agnes, on the
ground that the marriage must be proved
before the death of the wife can be
brought in evidence. The witness testified
that tee defendant left orders with his
assistant regarding the names for the
cotlin plates. He added, however, that
there were others present when the cof
fins left the house.
James P. Murphy, groundkeeper at the
Holy Crose Cemetery, testified that the
coffin plates are still upon the caskets in
the vault at the cemetery. George
Thompson of the Crocker building testi
fied that Collins introduced a woman
other than Charlotta as his wife. " The
witness detcribed the woman so intro
duced.
At this juncture Attorney McPike, for
the defense, objected to Byington's re
peated questioning of witnesses regard
ing their interviews with the District
Attorney before appearing on the stand.
McPike Questioned the conduct of tne
District Attorney in examining the de
fense's witnesses in hie private office be
fore they went upon the stand, where
upon Byington wanted to know if there
was any objection, and welcomed the
counsel for the defense to interview any
of tht State's witnesses. McPike de
clared he did not want any intimidation
or Influencing of witnesses, and Judge
Lennon stopped the argument by a repri
mand.
George L. Blake, who was at one time
a client of Collins, said that he called on
Collins just before the death of Agnes
with a request that he become his attor
ney. He declares he was met at the door
of Collins' house by a woman he identi
fies at- Oharlotta, who told him that the
defendant would probably not be able io
undertake his case, as his wife was lying
upstairs very sick and would probably
die. The- witness said that Charlotta
added -that Mr. Collins had already lost
a child.
DR. ROGERS IMPEACHED.
Mrs. Maryland Sheppard related a con
versation with Dr. Rogers, in which the
doctor told her that Mr. Collins' wife had
died. The purpose of the questions was
to impeach Dr. Rogers, who testified that
no such conversation ever occurred.
Frederick W. King, a clerk, testified
that a woman other than Charlotta came
to his store in 1900 and represented iier
self to be Mrs. George D. Collins. Chris
tian Brandhorst of the Crocker build
ing said he was introduced to a Mrs. Col
lins, who was accompanied by two chil
dren, and the woman was not Charlotta.
William Oostc,- a florist, said that he
had an order for floral pieces for Mrs.
Collins' funeral. F. V. Kington, at one
time one of Collins' assistants, now an
attorney, testified regarding the prepar
ing of the second answer, and said that
Collins knew nothing of its . preparation.
Jacob S. Meyer, another of Collins' as
sistants, was the last witness. He proved
a reluctant one for the prosecution. He
was finally taken in hand by Judge L>en
non, and he adm. .-j that he arranged
a meeting between Charlotta and Collins
at the Crocker building after Collins* re
turn from Chicago, but refused to say
that Collins was present at the meeting.
He. further added thaÂ£, he always ad
dressed Charlotta as Mrs. Charlotta,
which caused a titter in the courtroom.
The case will be continued to-day at 10
o'clock.
' Wants Franchise Advertised.
J. S. McGlnnls petitioned the Supreme
Court yesterday to command the Mayor
and the Common Council of San Jose
to advertise for bids on a franchise
permitting an electric railroad to be
constructed on Santa Clara and Tenth
streets. In the Garden City. It Is al
leged that the defendant officials mean
to irive away a valuable franchise with
out conforming' to the law -which makes
an advertisement for bids compulsory.
The court will hear the arguments the
first Tuesday in January. The Superior
Court decided in favor of the officials
md the corporation.
License* Â»vr Banks.
The , Board of Bank Commissioners
Issued licenses yesterday for. the*estab
lishment of the Valley Bank at El'Cen
tro, with a branch at Holtvllle, and the
Farmers' and Merchants*.-' Bank at Hay
wards. The former institution, which
Is capitalized at $100,000. will have W.
F. Holt for its 'president and True
Venceville for its cashier. T. 8.. Rus
sell will be president of the Hay wards
bank and John Park cashier. Its capi
talization is J50.000.

The Board of ' Supervisors yesterday

The ''Municipal Ownership League filed
a communication in which the following
suggestions are â¢ made concerning \u25a0 the
franchise: j
As this road is to end at Twelfth and Mar
ket stresrs. the civic center of the city, as
laid down by Architect 'Burnham in his plans,'
no monopoly of terminal privileges or facilities .
should be granted, but all such rights should
be owned by the city, so that, if necessary,'
all railroads may, under - appropriate restrict '
tiens. be permitted to enter the heart of 'the
city and a central or union depot or terminal
be established by the city Itself. Should "the
board fc-rant the franchise in its present form,
the nsceesary ilTect will be to prevent other
roads from reaching the center of;- the .city
or to enable this company -to eharjje them
heavy tolls. Thli> franchise is wortii a vast
I sum.of money and it ' ought . not -to be granted
unless the city le properly compensated. \u0084 \u0084â¢
The leacue also suggests th.U a for-T
feiture clause sh said be t incorporated iri
the franchise that owing "to the danger
from electric wires tne ' road ehouM come'
through a tunnel in the' thickly., settied
portions of the oity, aril that .the/ fiar.;
chise should be, made non/-assignable. The
communication --was. filed too â¢ late"" to be

As he sat in the crowded cage of Police

dwarfed by: contrast the most j gijjantic
of his fellow., prisoners. Acroes his enor
mous torso were folded a pair of arms
mighty in bone and brawn, his ; massive
head was thickly thatched, with coarse
and unkempt black hair, and his platter
like face, of ruddy hue, was ; heavily
'fringed with -matted whisker.' When he
stepped forth in response to* the bailiff's
summons '\u25a0 it was seen that his . nether
limbÃ were proportionately j great.: The
rapt gaze cast upon him by the/assem
bled peace guardians was expressive of
mingled ? curiosity, awe, admiration and
envy.' * . /
"What a cop he'd make!" came in whis-
per from the attorneys' table. In a guess
ing, contest that ensued as to the nature
of the charge against the big man the
most perspicacious of the \u25a0 pleaders Â» flew
far wide of the mark. He confidently
pronounced it at least a felony, and hung
his* head, in humiliation, when , the testi
mony brought out the fact that it was
merely a disturbance of the -. peace, \u25a0 con
sisting of hurling oral abuse at a';house

her and declared he was starving, and al
though his external ensemble belled that
statement, she j bade him enter her domi

known of that stove to \ act in - such | a
way before, â¢he urged .'her not to hurry.
"F*r there.'s slower folks than you," he
added, "but they're in the cimitiry."'
Finally, piqued by his , badinage, she
abandoned- her culinary -endeavor, and
'commanded: him to > go, -but he not only
refused j to j move until . he , was fed, i but
addressed to . her " some % language V that

CAPTAIN SAUNDERS'
PAPERS DEMANDED
Agent Taylor Orders Them
Surrendered on Ground .
of Fraud.
United States Secret Service Agent
Richard^H. Taylor announced yesterday
that he had addre&sed a letter to Captain
C. H. Saunders of the steamship Man
churia, demanding that the captain sur
render Immediately his naturalization
papers and his lice&se as master of Amer
ican vessels. Agent Taylor will have the
papers canceled as soon as he receives
them. . He holds that Captain Saunders
was fraudulently naturalized.
The authorities have ascertained that
Captain Saunders arrived In Brooklyn in
ISBO, at the age of 31 years, and that he was
naturalized in 18S6 as a minor by means
of fraud and misrepresentation.
Henry S. Morton, first officer of the
Manchuria-, was also Investigated. The
result was that his naturalization papers
were canceled for irregularity, and after
this painful operation had been completed
Agent Taylor took Mate Morton before
United States District Judge Hanford and
bad him forswear all allegiance to King
Edward or any other foreign potentate,
after which oath Mate Morton breathed
the air of freedom once more as an inde
pendent Yankee skipper, made over, 'tis
true, buÂ£ a 'passably good. Imitation.
Second Officer Andres P. Lundln of the
Manchuria^ surrendered his "papers and
theyvwere canceled for fraud. He. will b_e
obliged to remain an alien for sonic
time. - .
