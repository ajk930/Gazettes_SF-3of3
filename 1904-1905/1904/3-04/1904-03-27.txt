: ; aV the soothing rays enveloped her,
Mariposa felt '.the strain of mind and
body relax and a sense of rest suffuse
her. She stretched herself in^o a "more
reposeful ' attitude, one arm thrown
along v the back of the bench. Her book
lay beside, her on the seat. To keep
the I blinding j; light "from "her eyes she
tilted her 'hat forward till the shade of

This she nibbled gingerly as they
passed under the odorous, dark shade
of the cypresses. Benito spread a trail
of shells behind him, dragging his feet
in silent happiness, his eyes fixed on the
brilliant prospect of sunlit green that
filled j In the end of the vista like a
drop-curtain. . ?'*-':.
As they emerged from the cypress
shadows the lawns and shrubberies of
the park lay; before them
vivid , in their variegated greens. The
scene suggested a picture in Its mo
tionless beauty, the sunlight sleeping
on stretches of shaven turf where the
peacock strutted, the red dust of the
drive unstirred by wind or wheel.xRich
earth scents mingled with perfume
of the winter blossoms, delicate breaths
of violets from beneath the trees, spices
exhaled by belated roses still bravely
blossoming in November, and now and
then a whjff of the acrid, animal odor of
the eucalyptus.
. Following pathways, now damp be
neath the shade of melancholy spruce,
and pine, now hard and dry between
velvety lawns, they came out on *a
large circular opening. Here Mariposa
sat down on a bench, with her back
to a sheltering mass of fir and hemlock,
the splendid sunshine pouring on her.
Benito, with his bag in his hand,
trotted off to the grassy slope opposite
where custom has* ordained that little
boys may roll about" and play! He hafl
hardly settled himself there to the fur
ther enjoyment of his nuts when, an
other boy appeared and made friendly
overtures, "with* his eyes on the bag.
Mariposa could not hear them, but she
could see the first advance and Benlto's
somewhat wary eylngs of the stranger.'
,Ih; a few moments the formalities of
introduction were over, and they were
both lying* on their stomachs on the
grass, kicking gently, with their toes,
while the bag stood between them.
Mariposa had intended to read, but
her book lay unopened in her lap. The
Bun in - California is something more
than. warming and cheerful. â¢ It is me
dicinal. There is some unnamed balm
in its light that soothes the tormented

. The bright days continued. On a ra
diant 'Saturday afternoon, Mariposa,

started forth, to spend an~hour or 'two
In ; the park. She 'had* done 'this several
times before, finding the green peace
and solitude of that "beautiful spot
soothing to her, harassed spirit. It was
a long ride in those days, and this had
'its charm, the steam dummy cresting
the tops of sandy hills, clothed with
lupins . and tiny frightened oaks,
crouching before the sea winds. On
'tthis' occasion she had invited the escort
of i Benito, who had, been hanging
drearily about the house, thinking with
mingled triumph" and 'envy, of Miguel,
who had gone with his mother to have
a tooth pulled'Out.. : -, -.
- "Pulling the: tooth's bad, of course,"
Benito had said to MaÂ«-iposa./as he
trotted by her side to the car, : "but
then. afterward there's candy. I dunno
but' what it's wortlj while. .And then
you have the tooth."
. "Have the tc-oth ! " said . Mari posa.
"What do you want the tooth for?
"You can show It to the boys in
school, and' you can generally trade it.
I traded mine for a knife with two
blades, but both of .'em was broke." /
benito,. was becoming very friendly
with Mariposa. He was a cheerful and
expansive poul. Could they have heard
him, Uncle Gam and his mother might
have suffered some embarrassment on
the score of his revelations as to their
quarrels concerning his upbringing.
Benito had thoroughly gauged the ca
pacity of each of them in resisting his %
'charms and urging him to higher and
better things. He was already at the
stage when his mother appealed slight
ly to his commiseration and largely to
his sense of humor. . Mariposa saw that
while he had grasped the great fact
that his Uncle Gam had an unfortu
nately snft heart,; he also knew there
was a/ stage/ when it was resolutely
hardened and' his most practiced wiles
fell baffled from the surface.
They alighted from the Â¦ car at what
was then the main entrance, and,' side
by, side, Benito fluently talking, sihade
toward .the gate. Here", a peanut/ven
der had artfully placed his stall, and
the fumes from the roasted nuts rcise
gratefully to .the nostrils of the^small
boy. He/said nothing, but BniffedAvith
"an ostentatious noise.' and then looked
sldewise at Mariposa. One of the
sources of his resp<*ot ; for her ...was/ that

He. had had other talks with Harney

"That's It. I want you to go to

I'd see to it that yours' got every

She Â¦paused..
"Iâ I'mâ afraid It will be impossi
ble." taid Mariposa,- in a low voice.
"Impossible!" exclaimed the eider
woman, sitting upright in -her Bur
prise. "Why?" ' 'â¢
Mariposa had come to the house of
Mrs. Shackleton burning with a sense
iÂ»he looked at Mariposa, not smiling,
nor condescending, but with a hard
earnestness. The girl raised her eyes
and the two glances met.
"His wishes will regard to me?"
said Mariposa, with a questioning in
flection.
'â¢Exactly, I understand just how it
r.as. And it wasn't fair that simply
because you didn't happen to be able
to " go* to the office at that time you
should lose your chance of a musical
education and all that might have
come out of it. Now, Miss Moreau.
It's my intention to carry out my hus
band's wishes."
Maiiposa nodded, then feeling that
the must say something, she mur
mured:
"My mother died. I was not well,
and 'I couldn't see him."
â¢â¢"Your father" â Bessie looked down
at the deeply bordered handkerchief
in her hand â "was a man of great
kindliness and generosity. Mr.
Shackleton knew him in the Sierras,
mining, a long time ago, when he" â
phe paused, not from embarrassment,
but in order to choose her words care
fully â "was very kind to my husband
and cjlhers of our party. It was an
obligation Mr. Shackleton never for
*o.t."
Manposa could make no answer.
iShackleton had never spoken to her
with" this daring. Bessie looked at her
for a response^ and saw her with her
C5cs on the ground, pale and slightly
frowning. She wanted to sweep away
aiiy possible suspicion from the girl's
mind by making her understand that
â¢thÂ« attitude of the family toward her
"ids'* from gratitude for a past benefit.
"Mr. Shackleton," she went on. "of
ten talked to me about his plans for
you. He wanted to have you study in
P^ris; under some teacher Lepine
spoke to him about. I -understand
you've got a remarkable voice. I
vasited, several times, to hear you, but
it couldn't seem to be managed, living
in the country, and always so busy. In
"his sudden â passing away, all these
plans came to an end.- He hadn't reg
.ularly arranged anything. There were
such a lot of delays."
Mtiriposa was becoming used to this
I.hrase and could listen to it without
the stare of surprise, or the blush of
consciousness.
â¢So Mr. Shackleton told me," she
answered.
THE vast lower floor was loftipr
and more spacious than any
thing she had ever seen before.
There were glimpses through the
doors, and artificial elongations of
perspective by means of mirrors. The
long receding vista was touched with
gleams of light on parquet flooring, re
flections on the gray surfaces of mir
rors, the curves of porcelain vases, the
bosses of glided frames. Over all
hung the scent of flowers', that were
massed here and there in Chinese
bowls.
Bessie's step, and the accompanying
rustle of brushing silks, brought the
girl to her feet, rigid and cold. The
widow swept into the room with ex
tended hand. She was richly and cor-,
rectly garbed in lusterless black, that
sent out the nervous whisperings of
crushed silks and exhaled a faint per
fume. It was impossible to Ignore the
hand, and Mariposa touched it with
her own for a moment. She had 'seen
Bessie only once before, on the even
ing of the opera. The change wrought
in her by grief and illness was notice
able. Her* fine, healthy color had
faded; her eyes were darkened, and
there were many deep 'lines on her
.forehead and about her mouth. Nev
ertheless, a casual eye would have still
noticed her as a woman of vigor, men
tal and physical. It was easy to un
derstand how she had stood shoulder
to shoulder with her husband in his
fight for fortune. >. *.Â¦.*
â¢ She motioned Mariposa to a chair
facing the window, and studied her # as
she glibly accomplished the common
place greetings. Her heart drew to
gether with a renewed spasm of jeal
ousy as she noted the girl's superiority
to her own daughter. What subtly
fhier qualities had Lucy had. that her
child should be thus distinguished
from the other children of Jake
Shackleton? The indignation working
ngainst this woman gave a last touch
of stateliness to poor Mariposa's nat
ural dignity of demeanor. She seemed
to. belong, by nature and birth, to
these princely surroundings, which
completely dwarfed Maud, and even
mad? the adaptive Bessie look com
mon.
"My husband," said the elder
woman, when the beginnings of the
conversation were disposed of, "was
rery much interested in you. He
knew your father, Dan Moreau, very
well."

In h*er heavy mourning, Maud
looked more nearly pretty than she
had ever done before. It was not the
dress that beautified her, but the hap
piness of her engagement to Latimer,
with whom she was deeply in love,
which had lent her the fleeting grace
and charm that only love, well be
stowed, can give. She carried a large
bunch of violets in her hand, and her
face was slightly flushed.
The Count, who had attentively read
the Mill of Jake Shackleton in the pa
pers, was staying on in San Francisco.
His attentions to Maud were not more
assiduous, but they were more "seri
ous," to use the technical / phrase,"
than heretofore. She would make
him an ideal wife, he thought. Even
her lack of beauty was an advantage.
When an American girl was both rich
and. pretty, she was more than , even
the most tactful and sophisticated
Frenchman could manage. Maud,
ugly, gentle, ( and not clever, would be
a delightful wife, ready to love hum
bly, unexactlng, easy to make happy.
The Count, a handsome, polished Pa
risian, speaking excellent English;
bowed over Mrs. Shackleton's hand,
and then. In answer, to her words of in
troduction, ' shot an exploring look,
warmed by a glimmer of , discreet ad
miration, at Mariposa. ' He wondered
who she was, for his practiced eye took
in at a glance that she was 'shabbily
Mrs. Shackleton gave a shrug; and
rose to her feet. The girl was incom
prehensible. She was either very
subtile and deep, or she was extraor
dinarily dull and shallow. Shackle
ton had said to her once that she
seemed to 'him childish, and undevel
oped for her age. The woman's keen
eye saw deeper. If Mariposa was not
disingenuous, she would always, on
the side of shrewdness and worldly
wisdom, be undeveloped
"Well, my dear," she said coldly,
"it all rests with yourself. But I
can't, conscientiously, let you throw
your best chances away. We won't
speak of this any more to-day. Bat
go home and think about it, and in a
week or two let me know .what con
clusion you'vs come to. * Don't ever
throw a chance away, even if you
don't happen to like ths person who
offers it,"
She gave Mariposa a shrewd and
good-natured smile. The jjirl, her
face crimsoning, was about to answer
when the hall door opened, and, with
a sound of laughter and a whiff of vio
lets, Maud and the Count de Lamolle
entered the room.
"What do you mean by 'as things
are now'? Has anything- happened' to
change your ideas since my husband
first made the suggestion to you?", TV.
Mariposa told her lie as a woman
does, with reservations. It was cre&f.
itably done, for It was the first lie she.
had ever told in her life.
"Nothing has actually happened,
but â Iâ I â have changed."
"And are you going to let a girl's
whims stand In the way of your suc
cess in life?' I can't believe that. My
dear, you're handsome and you've a
fine voice, but do you think those two
things, without a cent behind them,
are going to put you on top of the
heap? You're not the woman to get
there without a lot of boosting."'
"Why should I want to get on top
of the heaÂ»?"
"Oh, if you want to stay at the bot
tom â "
"I don't want to accept it. I don't
want to take the money or be under
any obligation."
"You were willing to be under the
obligation, as you call it, a few weeks
ago ?"
Bessie's voice was as cold as steel.
From the moment she had entered the
room 6he had felt an instinctive antag
onism between herself and her hus
band's eldest child. It would become
a hatred in time. The girl's slow and
reluctant way of speaking seemed to
indicate that she expressed herself
with difficulty, like one who, 'under
pressure, tells the truth.
"My mother wanted me to accept
anything that was for my own -benefit.'
Now she is dead. I am my own mis
tress. I grieve or hurt no one but my
self if I refuse, your offer. .And, as
things are now, it is better for me to
refuse it." â¢ â¢ * i- . ' .
"I can't go," she said quietly; "I un
derstand that all you say is perfectly
true. You probably think I am silly
and ungrateful. I don't think I am
either, but that's because I know
what I feel. I thank you very much,
but I can't accept ft."
She rose, to her f eet. .' Bessie saw
that she was pale â evidently agitated.
"Sit down,"< she said, indicating the
chair again. "Now let me hear your,
reasons, my dear girl. People don't
throw up the chance of a lifetime for
nothing. What's behind all this?"
There was a pause. Mariposa said
slowly: ?"â¢*:">.'â¢'
of the -wrongs her mother had suf
fered at the hands of this woman and
her dead husband. She had thought
little of what the interview would be
like, and now, with the keen, hard,
and astonished eyes of Bessie upon
her, she felt that something more
than pride and indignation must help
her through. The -world's diplomacy
of tongue and brain was an unsus
pected'art to her. '
"I â I â !'â¢ she stammered irresolute.
ly, "have changed my mind since I
talked with Mr. ShackletonA'
"Changed your mind! But why?
What's made you change your mind
in so short a time?"
"Many things," said the girl, with
her face flushing deeply under Bes
sie's unflinching stare. "There have
been c.hanges â in â in â circumstances
â -and In me. â¢ My mother was anxious
for my advancement. Now she is
dead and â it doesn't matter."
It was certainly not a brilliant way
out of the difficulty. A faint smile
wrinkled the loose skin round Mrs.
Shackleton's eyes.
"Oh, my dear," she said, with a
slight touch of impatience in her
voice. "If that's all, I guess we
needn't worry about it. People die,
and we lone our energies and ambi
tion, eo we just want to lie round and
mourn. But at your age that don't
last long. You've got to make your
future yourself, and now's your
chance. It just comes once or twice
in a lifetime, and the people who get
there are the people who know
enough to snatch it as it comes by."
Mariposa's irresolution had passed.
She realized that she had not merely
to state her intentions, but to fight a
will unused to defeat.
TOMORROW'S TANGLE
"Oh, Mariposa!" he said softly. He
looked into her face with eyes brim
ming with teasing tenderness. "How
can you say that to me when my great
est fault has been to Jove you?"
"Love me!" she ejaculated with
breathless* scorn; "love me! Oh, Beni
to" â calling, with all her force â
"come; do come. I want you!"

heard, was too pleasantly engaged with
the companionship of his new. friend to
make any response. Early Mn life he
had learned the value of an occasional
attack of deafness. .,.,./.,... i Z..sÂ£":"'-.
Mariposa made a motion to go to him,
but Essex gently moved In front of her.
She drew. away from him, knitting her
brows In helpless, heated rage.
"You know you're treating me badly,"
he said.
"Treating you very badly," she now
fairly gasped, once more a bewildered
fly in the net of this subtile spider,
"how else should I treat you?"
"Kindly," he said, softly bending his
compelling glance on her, "as a woman
treats a man who loves her." "/
"Mr. Essex," she said, turning on him
with all the dignity she had at her com
mand, "we don't seem to understand
each other. The last time I saw you,
you insulted and humiliated me. I
don't know how it can be, but you seem
to have forgotten all about It. I
haven't. I never can, and I don't want
to Bee you or speak to you or think of
you ever again in this world."
"What makes you think I've forgot
ten?" he said, suddenly dropping his
voice to a key that thrilled with mean-
Ing.
Â¦ He saw the remark shake her Into
startled half-comprehension. That she
still took his words at their face value
proved to him again how strangely
simple she was. i.
"What makes^ypu think I've forgot
ten?" he repeated. ;
She raised her eyes in arrested as
tonishment and met his, now seemUg
suddenly, to have become charged with

"How could I forget?" he murmured.
"Do you really think I could ever for
get that evening?" .
She turned away speechless with em
barrassment and anger, recollections of
the kisses of that ill-omened interview
burning, in her face.
"When . a man wounds* the one wo
man in the world he cares for, can he
ever forget, do you think?"
He again had the gratification of
seeing her flash a look of artless sur
prise at him.
"Thenâ then â " she stammered, com
pletely bewildered, "if you know that
you wounded me so, why do you come
back? Why do you-speak to me now?
There is nothing more to be said be
tween us."
"Yes. there is; much more."
She drew back, frowning, on the alert
to go. For a second he thought he was
to lose this precious and unlooked-for
chance of righting himself with her.
"Sit down," he said entreatingly; "sit
down;. I must speak to you."
She. turned from him and sent a quick
glance toward Benito. She was going.
"Mariposa," he said, desperately
catching at her arm, "pleaseâ a mo
ment. Give me one moment. You must
listen to me."
: . She tried to draw her arm away, but
he held it, and pleaded, genuine feel-
Ing flushing his face and roughening
his voice.
N "I begâ I imploreâ of "you to listen to
me. I only ask a moment. Don't con
demn me without hearing what I have
' to say. I behaved like a blackguard. I
know it. It's haunted me . ever since.

explain" and make you forgive me." *
He was really stirred; the sincerity of
his' appeal \ touched the heart, once ' so
warm, now grown so cold toward him.
She sat down on the bench, at the. end
farthest : from , him, her whole â¢ bearing

in his eyes there was not a shade of
consciousness.
"What a piece of. luck!" he said.'
"Who'd have thought of meeting you
here?".
â¢ Mariposa had nothing to respond.
In a desperate desire for flight and pro
tection she looked for Benito, but he
was at the top of the slope, well out of
earshot of anything but a scream.
Essex surveyed her face with fond at
tention. â¢ * Â¦
"You're looking better than you did
before you moved," he said; "you were
just a little too pale then. You know,
I didn't know it was you at all. I was

drive, and I hadn't the least Idea it was
you till I saw your hair"â his eye
lighted on it caressinglyâ "I knew*there
was only one woman in San Francisco
with hair like that."
His voice seemed to mesmerize her at
first. Now her volition came back and
she rose.
"Benito!" she cried; "con.e at once."
The two little boys had their heads
close together and neither turned.
"What are you going to go for?" said
Essex in surprise. !"â¢ .
"What a question!" she said, picking
up her book with a trembling hand,
and thinking in her ignorance that he
spoke honestly; "what an insulting
question!" . \ ' ;
"Insulting! What on . earth do you
mean by that?" coaxingly. "Please tell
me why you are going?"
"Because I don't want ever to see
you or speak to you. again," she said
in a voice shaken with anger. "I
couldn't have believed any man could
be so lacking in decency as â as â to do
this."
"Do what?" he asked with an air of
blank surprise. "What am I doing?"
''Thrusting yourself on me this way
when â when â you know that the sight
of you is humiliating and hateful to
me."

Mariposa caught him by the hand
and -swept him back toward the path

standing near the bench, an elegant

they passed him he ilsed his hat. Mar

She looked at him with cold dtflanoe,
and said steadily: '
"No?" he exclaimed, in loud-voiced
Incredulity and bending his head to
look into her face. "No?"
"No," she reiterated; "I said no/* "
Her words still further alarmed' the
man. He knew they were not those of
a woman swayed by sentiment, far less
by passion. V; .
"That's all true," he said hastily,
"that's all true of what I said to you
that night in the cottage. Now It's
different: Aren't you large-hearted
enough to forgive a man whose great
est weakness has been his Infatuation

Mariposa started perceptibly.. She
turned and looked with . amazed eyes
into his face.* He seemed another man
from the. one who had so- bitterly hu

was pale and In earnest. -
"Will you?" he repeated.
"No." she said with slow decisiveness.
"I "fill not." *! T 5 - '
"Because you don't understand the
first principles of it. When you're fond
of people you don't want to hunt and
humiliate them. You don't want to

things. You want to protect them,
help them, take care of them; be proud
of them and say to all the world: 'Here,

Her. simplicity, that once would have
amused him, now had something In It
that at once touched and alarmed him.
There was a downright conviction In
it, that argument, eloquence; pa'saloa
even, would not be able to shake.
â¢ "And that, Mariposa," he said ardent
ly, "Is the way I ft>ve you."
"That the wayl" she echoed scorn
fully. "No â your way Is to ask me to

He paused, looking at her. Her pro

continued; with a" slight diminution! of
confidence:

He, leaned toward her, his face tense
and pale. As he became agitated and

grew calm and regained her hold on

her that frightened him. He felt that if

men with umbrellas low against their

went glimpses of muddy boots and wet

apathetic faces. The merchants of th*

"You're only a fool on that one point,

She spoke positively, but her pleading

took her hand. \" : 6 ~-~ J "".

and so refinedâ that white skin* and

Win said vaguely, yes, he guessed
there must be, wondering what the fel
low meant about there being something
warm about the hair. Fnrther_com
ment was ended by an attendant com

Ing It to the photographer.
The man held it out to Win with a
proud smile. It was an enlargement of
a small daguerreotype, taken .some
twenty years previously, and repre

that fell from the great crystal chan

looked preoccupied and stupid. The

REBELLIOUS HEART*
CHAPTER XVL
But one afternoon, a few days after
her encounter witfl Essex, she had come
in early to find the lower hall full of the
Eound of a high, crystal clear soprano,
which was pouring from the teacher's
room. She listened interested, held in
e. spell of envious attention. It was
evidently a girl of whom Pierpont had
spoken to her. who possessed 'lie one
voice of promise he had yet found, and
who was studying for the stage. Lean
ing over tha stair rail. Mariposa felt,
with a tingling at her heat*, that this
tinging had a finish and poise hers en
tirely lacked, and yet the voice was
thin, coiorlesa and fragile compared
with her own. With all its flawless
ease and fluency it had not the' same
splendor of tone, the tame passionate
thxin. _ -
Eh* went slowly upstairs, pursued by
the beautiful sounds, bending over the
railing to catch them more fully, with,
for the first time since her mother's
death, the desire to emulate, to be up
and doing, to hear once more the rich
notes swelling from her throat.
"Bome day 111 ting for him," she said
to herself, with her head up and her
eye* bright, "and he'll see that none of
them has a voice like mine."
The stir of enthusiasm was- still on
her. when she ehut the door of her own
room. It was hard to settle to any
thing with this sudden welling up of
jold ambitions disturbing the apathy
following on grief. She was standing,
looking down on the garden â a prospect
which bad long lost its forlornness to
her accustomed eyesâ when a knock at
the -door fell gratefully on her ears.
Even the society of Mrs. Garcia, with
her head tied up in the white duster,
bad its advantages now and then.
But it was not Mrs. Garcia, but Mrs.
Willers whom the opening door re
vealed. Mariposa's welcome was
warmed not only by the desire for com
panionship but by genuine affection.
She had come to regard Mrs. Willers
as her best friend.
They did not see each other as often
as formerly, for the newspaper woman
found all her time occupied by her new
work. To-day being Monday, she had
managed to get off for the afternoon,
as it was in the Sunday edition that the
Woman's Page attained its most im
posing proportions. Monday was a day
off. But Mrs. Willers did not always
avail herself of It She was having the
first real chance of her life and -was
working harder than she had ever'done
before. Her bank account was mount-

As soon as the singing teacher heard
that Mariposa had a voice he had es
pied in her the object of his search and
begged her to sing for him. But she
had refused. She had not sung a note
since her mother's death. The series of
unforeseen and disastrous develop
ments that had followed the
opening, scene of the drama in
.which she * found herself the
central figure had robbed her of all
desire to use the srift which was her
one source of fortune. Sometimes,
alone in her room, her fingers running
over the keys of the piano, she won
dered dreamily what it would be like
once again to hear the full, vibrating
sounds booming out from her chest.
Now end then she had tried a note or
two or an old familiar strain, then had
stopped, repelled and disenchanted.
Her voice sounded coarse and strange.
And -while it quivered on the air there
came a rush of exquisitely painful
memories.
"I can't see what's the goodN*f work
ing," she said, daintily brushing the
surface cf the carpet with her broom,
'"if j:ou don't make anything by your

poundir.g cf her own pupils Mariposa
could hear the voices of Pierpont's as
they performed vocal prodigies under
iheir teacher's goadings.
The ycurio man was unusual and in
teresting. He had a "rnethoa which he
expounded to Mariposa during, the pro
cess cf meals. It was founded on a
large experience of voices In general
and a close anatomical study of the
vocal chords. All he wanted, he said,
to demonstrate its excellence to the
world was a voice. Mrs. Garcia, who
used to drop in on Mariposa with her
head tied up in white swathings and a
broom in her hand, had early in their
acquaintance given her a life history of
the two other boarders, with a running
accompaniment of her own, comments.
Pierpbnt had not her highest approval,
as he was exasperatingly indifferent to
money, beirg bound, to the exclusion
of all lesser interests, on the search for
his voice. Half his pupils were taught
for nothing and the other half forgot
to pay. or Pierpor.t forgot to send in
his bills, which was the same thing in
the end. Mrs. Garcia thought.
CHAPTER XV.
THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY.
The subject interested him and fur
nished food for conversation till they
reached their car and were swept
homeward over the low hills, breaking
here and there into sand, and with the
little oaks crouching in grotesque fear
before the winds.
â¢There was something in this harm
less comment that caused Mariposa
s-udden'.y to loosen her hold.
-My hand c-f ten does that way," she
said with an air of embarrassment.
.-What makes it?" asked Benito, sud
dfr.Iy interested.
"I don't know; perhaps playing the
piano." she said, feeling the necessity of
having to dissemble.
"I'd like to be able to make my hand
shake that way," Benito observed en
viously. "When grandma had the
chills I used, to watch her. But she
shook all ovfr. Sometimes her teeth
used to click. Do your teeth ever

..."What makes your hand shake that

"Say," said Benito. "leggo my hand.
What's the sense 'er hauling me this,

Mariposa did not heed, and they went
on at a feverish pace.

forgot what your name Is." ~\->
.The answer was lost In the interven

â¢Mariposa disappeared behind the
scree* c-f thick-growing evergreens.
The girl made no answer.- She felt
hot and sore, pricked by this insistent
probing of spots that were still raw.
"Dots heâ does heâbother you?", the
elder woman in an incredulous
voice.' Somehow she could not recon-
Mrs. Willers knew enough of human
nature not to be at all convinced by
this remark.
,"He's not the man for any woman to
give her heart to*. He's not the man to
take seriously. He's never loved any
thing ih his life but himself. Don't let
yourself be fooled by him. He's hand
some, and he's about- the smoothest
talker I ever run up against But don't
you be crazy enough to fall in love
with him."
"I tell you, I don't like him."
"My goodness, I wish there was
somebody in this world to take care of
you. You've got no sense, and you're
so unfortunately good-looking. Some
day you'll be fooled just as I was with
Willers. Are you telling the truth? It
isn't Essex that's made you -change
your mind?"
These repeated accusations exasper
ated Mariposa.
"No, it is not," she said angrily; and
then, in the heat of her. annoyance, "if
anything would make me accept Mrs.
Shackleton's offer it would be the hope
of getting away from -that man.":
There was no doubt she was speaking
the truth now.- Mrs. Wlilers* point of
view of the situation, underwent a ka
leidoscopic upsetting: .
"Oh," she said. In ; a subdued voice,
"then it's he that's' in 'â w^l flMiTfttf
Mariposa looked up quickly. .^The
elder woman saw that, for a moment,
she was startled.
"Some man!" she exclaimed. "What
man?"
"You haven't changed your mind be
cause of Essex?"
"Essex!" She slowly crimsoned, and
Mrs. Wi!lers kept her pitiless eyes on
the rising flood of color.
"Oh, my dear girl," she said almost
in an agony/"don't say you've got fond
of him."
"I don't like Mr. Essex. Iâ I â can't
bear him."
She looked at her Interlocutor with an
attempt at a coaxing smile. Mrs. Will
ers saw that it was an effort, and re
mained grave.
"I don't want you to have secrets
from me. dear, no more than I would
Edna. Mariposa," she said In a lowered
voice, leaning forward and putting her
hand on the girl's knee, "is it because
of some man?"
Mrs. Willers met the amber-clear
eyes and saw, with an uneasy thrill,
that there was knowledge in them
there had not been before. It was not
the limpid glance of the candid, un
spoiled youth it had once been. She
felt a contraction of pain at her heart,
as though she had read the same
change In Edna's eyes.
"What made you change your mind?
â that's what I want to know."
Mariposa lowered her lids.
"I can't tell. Wharmakes anybody
change his mind? You think differ
ently. Things happen that make you
think differently."
"Well, what's happened to make you
think differently?"
.The lines appeared again on the
smooth forehead. She shifted her
glance to the window and then back
to the hands on her lap.
"Suppose I don't want to tell? I'm
not a little girl like Edna, to have to
tell every thought I have. Mayn't I
have a secret, Mrs. Willers V . r
"Mariposa, look me in the eye."
"But you wanted to go only a month
or two before when Shackleton him
self made you the offer?"
Mariposa nodded without answering.
"But why? That's the part that's so
extraordinary. You'd take it 'from
him, but not from his wife."
"A person might change her mind,
mightn't she?"
"A fool ' might, but " a reasonable
woman, â¢without a cent, with hardly a
friend, how could she?"
"Well, she has." â¢
"I can't explain it to you," said Mar
iposa. "Iâ I â didn't want to go. That
was alL"
Facing her in the bright light, the
questioner's eyes were like gimlets on
her face. Mrs. Willers saw its dis
tressed uneasiness, but could read no
further. Three days before she had re
ceived Mrs. Shackleton's letter, and had
been amazed by its contents. She could
neither assign to herself nor to Mrs.
Shackleton a reason for the girl's un
explainable conduct.
"Stuff!" observed Mrs. Willers brisk
ly. "Don't try to tell lies; you don't
know how. One's got to have some
natural capacity for It. You've had an
offer that makes it possible for you to
go to Europe, educate your voice, study
French and German, and become a pri
ma donna. Everything's to be paid â
no limit set on time or money. Now,
what In heaven's name made you re
fuse that?" W : '
"What do you mean?" said Mariposa
weakly, trying to gain time. "What
did she tell you?"
"My dear, you know as well as I do
what she tc-ld me. And I can't maki
head or tail of it. What's come over
"I don't know," said the girl in a low
voice. "I suppose I've changed."
Mariposa's color deepened. A line ap
peared between her eyebrows, and she
looked out of the window.
"Well." she said; "and did she say
anything about me?"
"That's what she didâ a lot. A lot
that sorter stumped me. And I've
come up here to-day to find out what's
the matter with you. "What is It that's
making you act like several kinds
of fool all at once?"
"That's Just what I've come to find
out. Left a desk of work, and Miss
Peebles hopping round like a chicken
with its head off, to find out what
you've been doing. I'd have come up
before only I couldn't get away. Mari

Mrs. Shackleton." â¢
"Well, young woman, do you know
I've come up here on the full Jump to
lecture you?"
"Lecture me?" said Mariposa, laugh
ing and bending forward to give Mrs.
Willers' hand a friendly squeeze.
"What have I been doing now?"

wealth and success.
She had no war- paint on to-day, but
was in her working clothes, dark and
serviceable, showing lapses between
skirt and waist-band, and tag ends of
tape appearing in unexpected places.
She had dressed in such a hurry that
morning that only three buttons of
each boot were fastened, though the
evening before Edna had seen to It that
they were all on. She had came up the
hill on what she would have called "a
dead run," and was still fetching her
breath with gasps.
Sitting opposite Mariposa, In the
bright light of the window, she let her
eyes dwell fondly on the girl's face.
"Humph!" said Mrs. Willers, "1
never thought that man would want to
marry a poor girl. But that's not as
surprising as that you had sense
enough to refuse him." , -
"I don't like him. I know I'm stupid,
but I Unow when I like a pe'rson and
when I don't. And I'd rather stand on
the corner of, Kearny and .Sutter
streets with a tin cup begging for nick
els than marry Mr. Essex, or be sent to
Europe by Mrs.. Shackleton."
"Well, you're a combination of smart
ness and folly I never expect to see
cile the picture of Essex as a repulsed
and suppliant wooer with her knowl
edge of him as such a very self-assured
and debonair person.
"I don't know what you mean by
â¢bother me,' " said Mariposa, still
heated. "He makes love to me, and I
don't, like it. I don't like him."
"Makes, love to you? What do. you
mean by 'makes love to you?' " ;
j* "He has asked me to | be his wife,"
said the victim, groaded to desperation
by this tormenting^ catechism. . .
She could not. have confessed that
Essex had entertained other designs
with regard to her, any more than she
'could have told her. real reason for re
'fusing Mrs. Shackleton's offer. But she
felt ashamed and miserable at these
half-truths, which her friend was giv
ing ear to with the wide eyes of won
der.
simultaneous laughter filled the room.
"You see you can't help saying it,"
said Mariposa, laughing, foolishly, ; wKh

Win opened his umbrella and went

talented girl, his desire to educate and

He backed away from It, and, as he
did so, was conscious that he knew ex

she had been going to speak, of the pre

Yet he had seen her only twice In his

looked . like â some one he knew well,
that had some vague, yet close con

way that his mind was gropingly ap

seized it, when the photographer's
voice behind him broke the thread.
"It will be ready in a moment. Mr.

fire with eyes of somber perplexity.
What was the matter with the girl?
Mrs. Willers stated positively that, as
far as she could ascertain, there was
no man that had the slightest influence
over Mariposa Moreau's affections. She
was acting entirely on her own volition.
But what had made her change her
mind. Mre. Willers did not know.
Something had undoubtedly occurred,
she thought, that had Influenced Mari
posa io a total reversal of opinion.
Mre. Willers said she could not imagine
what this was. but It had changed the
girl, not only In ambition and point of
view, but In character.
The letter frightened Bessie. It had
made her silent all through dinner, and
now brooding over the fire, she thought
of what it might mean and felt a cold
apprehension seize her. Could Mari
posa know? Her behavior and conduct
since Shackleton's death suggested
such a possibility. It was incredible to
think of, but Lucy might have told.
And also, might not the girl. In ar
ranging her mother's effects after her
death, have come on something, letters
or papers, which had revealed the past?
A memory rose up in Bessie's mind of
the girl wife she had supplanted,
clinging to the marlage certificate,
which was all that remained to remind
her of the days when she had been the
one lawful wife. Bessie knew that this
paper had been carefully tied In the
bundle which held Lucy's few posses
sions when they left Salt Lake. She
knew It was still in the bundle when
she. herself, had handed It to the de
serted girl In front of Moreau's cabin.
Might not Mariposa have found it?

Maud, in a muffled voice.

"What do you mean by that?" said
her mother, stiffening. /
"I mean Jack Latimer."
"Jack Latimer? One of your father's

"?Co f I won't come in," cried Maud,

the hand to the scene of punishment.
"There's nothing more to talk about.
I'm engaged to Jack Latimer, and I'm
going to marry him, and that's the be
ginning and the end of it all.
She felt desperately defiant, standing
there in the. darkness looking at her
mother's massive shape against the
glow of the lit doorway.

Shackleton, "who only gets $150 a

people." Â¦'Â¦ \i~ [ :'.

"What good will that do anybody?

don't want to. And why should Jack
Latimer throw me over because you
ask Ijlm to? He," she made a tremu
lous hesitation that would have touched
a softer heart, and then added, "he
likes me."
"Likes you!" repeated her mother,
with furious scorn, "he likes the five
million dollars."
"It's me," said Maud, passionately;
"it isn't the money. And he's the only
person in the world except Win who
has ever really liked me. I don't feel

fourth flight she paused, panting, while
the astonished office boy stared at her,
recognizing her as the chief's mother.
Mrs. Willers was in her cubby-hole,
with a drop-light sending a little :c!rcle
of yellow radiance over the middle of
the desk. A litter of newspaper cut-,
tings surrounded her; and Miss Peebles,

light, when the lady entered the room.
Miss Peebles rose with a flurried
haste and thrust forward the chair,' and
Mrs. Willers extricated herself from the
heaped up newspapers and extended a
welcoming hand. The greetings ended,
the younfjer woman bowed herself out,
her opinion of Mrs. Willers, If possible,
higher even than H had been before.
Mrs. Willers was' surprised, but dis

years, and had once heard, from her
late chief, that his wife approved her
matter and counseled her advancement.
But to, have her appear thus unan
nounced In the intimate heat and bur
den of office hours ! was decidedly un
expected. Mrs. Shackleton knew this
and proceeded to explain.
"You must think It queer, my v coming
down on you.t&Is way, when you're up
to your neck in work, but I won't keep
you ten minutes." She looked at the
small nickel .clock that ticked aggres
sively In the middle of the desk. "And
I know you are too busy a woman to
ask to come . air the way up to my
house. So I've come down to you."
"Pleased and flattered," murmured
Mrs. Willers, pushing' back her chair,
and kicking a space In the newspapers,
so that she could cross her knees' at
ease. "But, don't hurry, Mrs. Shackle
ton. Work's well on and I'm at your
disposal for a good many ten minutes."
"It's just to talk over, that letter you
sent me by Win. What do you under
stand by Miss Moreau's behavior, Mrs.
Willers?"
"I don't understand anything by it.
I don't understand it at all." â¢
"That's the way it seems to me.
There's only one explanation of it that
I can see, and you say that isn't the
right one."
"What was that?"
"That there's some man here she's
interested In. When a girl of that age.
without a cent, or a friend or a pros
pect, refuses an offer that means a
docsn t like that man, ana sne wouiant
marry him If he was hung over
with diamonds and was going to give
her the Con Virginia for a wedding
present." '*2|8Â§
"Bosh!" ejaculated her companion,
with sudden, sharp Irritation. "That's
what she says. They have no money
to marry, on, I suppose, and she's try-
Ing to keep her engagement secret. It
explains everything. I must say I'm
relieved.'. I had the girl on my mind,
and It seemed, to me she was so sense
less and fly-away that you didn't. know
where "stieM fetch uo."
Mrs. Willers was annoyed. It was not
pleasant to her to hear Mariposa
spoken'of this way. But a long life of
struggle and misfortune â¢ had taught
her, among other valuable things, the
art of hiding unprofitable anger under
a bland smile.
"Well, all' I can say," she said, laugh
ing qulte2 naturally, "Is that I hope
you're wrong. I'm sure I don't want to
see her married to that man."
"Why not?" queried Mrs. Shackleton,
with the sudden arrested glance of sur
prised curiosity. "What Is thereto oD
ject to in such a marriage?*'
"Hundreds of things," answered Mre.
Willers, feeling that there are many
disadvantages ,In having to converse
with your employer's mother on the
subject of one of your best friends.
"Who knows anything about Barry Es
sex? No one knows where he comes
from, or who he is, or even if Essex is
his name. I don't believe It Is, a/ all.
I think he Just took it because U sounds
like the aristocracy. And what's his
record? I'll lay ten to_one there are
things behind him he wouldn't like to
See published on the frontpage of The
Trumpet. He's no man to\make a girl
happy."
"You seem to be taking a good deal
for granted. Because you don't know
anything about him, It's no reason to
suppose the worst. He certainly looks
and acts like a gentleman, and he.^s
finely educated. And Isn't It better for
a girl like Miss Moreau to have a hus- f
band to take care of her than to go
roaming around by herself, throwing
away every chance she gets, for some
crazy notion? That young woman's "not
able to take care of herself. The best
thing for her Is to get Barry Essex to
do it for her." â¢ ._Â¦
"I've known women," said Mrs. Will
erB. Judicially, " who thought that, a
bad husband was better than no hus
band at all. But I'm not of that opinion
myself, having' had one of the bad ones.

She burst into wild .tears, and before
her mother could anÂ»wer or arrest her,
had brushed past her and fled up the
next, flight of stairs, the sound of her
sobs floating down from the upper
darkness to the listener's ears. Bessie
retreated Into the boudoir and shut the
door.
\ Maud ran on and burst into, her own
room, there to throw herself on the bed
and weep despairingly for hours. She
thought of her lover, -the one. human
being- besides her 'brother who had
never made her feel ; her "- inferiority,
and lying limp and shaken among the
pillows, thought witha ,wlld>thrlll of
longing of the time when she;. would be
free to creep into his arms and hide the
ugly face he found so: satisfactory
upon his heart. ; â¢. .
In the morning, before she was up,
Bessie visited her and renewed the con
versation- of the night before. Poor
Maud, with a throbbing head and
heavy eyes, lay - helpless, answering
questions that probed the tender secrets
of the clandestine courtship, whlcn had
been to her an oasis of almost terri
fying happiness in the lonely repression
of her life. Finally, unable longer to
endure her mother's sarcastic allu
sions 'to Latlmer's dlslngenuousness,
she sprang out of bed and ran into the
bathroom, which was part of the suite
she occupied. Here she turned on both
taps, the sound of the rushing water
completely drowning her mother's
voice, and sitting on the side of the tub,
looked drearily down into the bath
while Bessie's concluding and indig
nant sentences rose from the outer
side of the door.
Mrs. Shackleton lunched alone that
day. Win generally went to his club
for his midday meal, and Maud had
gone out early and found hospitality at
the house of Pussy Thurston. Bessie
had done more thinking that morning
in the intervals of her domestic duties
â she was a notable housekeeper and
personally superintended every depart
ment of her establishmentâ and had de
cided to dedicate part of the aftejnoon
to the society of Mrs. Willers. One of
the secrets of Mrs. Shackleton's success
in life had been her power to control
and retain Interests in divers matters
at the same time. Maud's unpleasant
news had not pushed the even more
weighty subject of Mariposa into abey
ance. It was as prominent as ever in
the widow's mind.
She drove down to The Trumpet office
soon after lunch and slowly, mounted
the long stairs. It would have been
a hardship for. any other woman of
her years and 'weight, but Bessie's
bodily energy was still remarkable, and
she had never indulged herself : in the
successful and maybe a famous future,
what's a person to think? Something's
stopping her. And the only thing I
know of that 'would stop her is that
she's fallen in love. . But you say sne
hasn't." .,'
"She don't strike me as being so. 8he
don't talk like a girl in love." .
"Isthere any man who is interested
In her and sees her continually?"
Mrs. Willers was naturally a truthful
woman, but a hard .experience of life
had taught, her to prevaricate with
skill and coolness when she thought
the occasion demanded it. ' She saw no
menace now, however, and vas en
tirely In' sympathy with Mrs. Shackle
ton in her annoyance at Mariposa's Ir
ritating behavior.
"Yes," she said, nodding with grave
eyes, "there is a man."
"Oh, there is," said the other, bend-
tag forward with a sudden Interest that
v.-ss not lost upon Mrs. Wlllsrs. "Who?"
"One of our men here, Barry Essex."
"Essex!" exclaimed the widow, with
a sudden light of "relieved comprehen
sion suffusing; her glance. "Of course.
I know him. -That dark, foreign-look
ing man that nobody knows anything
about. Mr. Shackleton thought a great
deal of him; said he was thrown. away
on The Trumpet., He's not a bit an or
dinary sort of person."
"That's the one," said Mrs. Willers,
nodding her head In somber acquies
cence. "And you're right about no
body knowing , anything about him.
He's a dark mystery, I think." _.
"And you say. he's In love with her?"
"That's .what I'd Infer from what she
tells me."
"What does she tell you?"
"He's asked hereto, marry him."
"Then . they're -engaged. That ac
counts for the whole thing." .
"No, they're not engaged. She's re
fused him." . '
"Refused him? That girl who's been
living In an abode at Santa Barbara,
refuse that Â¦ fine-looking fellow? Why.
she'll never seen a man like that again
in her life. She's not refused him? Of
course, she's engaged to him."
"No, you're mistaken. She's not. She
doesn't like him." Â¦ ' S ..,Â¦â¢'
"That's what she tells you. Girls al
ways say that sort of thing. That ex
plains the way. she's acted from the
start. He hadn't asked her when Mr.'
Shackleton was alive. She's engaged to
him now and doesn't want to leave him.
Â¦ She struck. me as, just that soft, senti
mental sort."
"You're wrong, Mrs. Shackleton; I
know Mariposa Moreau. She tells the
truth; all of it. That's why it's so hard
sometimes to" understand what she
means.* We're riot used to ; it. She
better than a palace on Nob Hill with
a husband that's no account."
"I'm afraid you're inclined to look on
the dark aide of matrimony," said Mrs.
Shackleton, laughing, as she rose from
her chair.
"May be so," said the other; ''but af
ter my experience I don't thlnfc.it suoh
a blissful state that I want to round up
all my friends and drive them into the
corral, whether they want to go or
not."
Mrs. Shackleton looked, down for a
pondering moment. She was evidently
not listening. Raising her head 'she
met Mrs. Wllers' half -sad,/ half-twink
ling Â«yes with a gaze of keen scrutiny,
and said:
"Then if it isn't a love affair, what is
it that's made Miss Moreau change her.

"Ah!" Mrs. Willers shrugged her
shoulders. "That's what I'd like to
know as well as you. I can only say
what It's not." .:
"And that's Barry Essex. Well, Mrs.
Willers, you're a smart woman, but you
know your business better than you do
the vagaries of young girls. I don't
know Miss Moreau well, but I'd like to
bet that I understand her this time bet
ter than you do."
She smiled genially and held out her
hand.
"My ten minutes are up," nodding at
the clock. "And I'm too much of a
business woman to outstay .my time
limit. , No" â in answer, to Mrs. Willers'
polite demurâ "I must go."
She moved toward the door, then
paused 'and said: .
"Isn't Essex a sort, of Frenchman?
Or wasn't he, anyway, .brought up in
Paris, Â»or had a French mother, or
something ?"
"As to his mother," said Mrs.' Wlllers,
Bourly, "the Lord alone. knows who she

Her interest in Mariposa was 'as strong
as her husband's and was entirely ex

by It thÂ«re Is proHt to them that see the sun."
â Eceleelastes. .
Marlposa's $16 a month had been aug
mented to $28 by the accession of three
new pupils. These had been acquired
through Isaac Pierpont. who was glad
to find a cneap teacher for his poten
tial prima donnas, who were frequently
lacking in the simplest knowledge of
instrumental music.
Mariposa was impressed and flattered
by. her extended clientele, and at first
felt some embarrassment in finding
that one. of the pupils was a woman ten
year* older than herself. The worry
she had felt on the score of her living
war now at rest, for Pierpont had
promised her his continued aid, and her
new scholars professed themselves
much pleased with her efforts.
Her monthly earnings were sufficient
to cover her exceedingly modest living
expenses. The remnants of her fortune
âthe few dollars left after her moth
er's funeral and the money realized by
the sale of the Jewelry and furniture
that were the last relics of their beaux
joursâ made up the amount of $320.
This was In the bank. In the little desk
that stood on a table In her room was
Â¦the, $500 In "gold Shackleton had sent
'.her. She had not touched It and never
Intended to. seeming to repudiate its
possession, by keeping it thus secret
and apart from her other store.
The time was wearing on toward mid-
December. Christmas was beginning to
figure in the conversation of Miguel
and Benito, end with an eye to its ap
proach they had both Joined a Sunday
school, to which they piously repaired
every Sabbath morn. They had intro
duced the question of presents In their
'conversations with Mariposa with such
smiling persistence that she had finally
promised them that, on her first free
afternoon, she would go down town and
price certain articles they coveted. The
afternoon came within a few days af
ter her promise, one of her pupils send
ing her word -that she was invited out
of town for the holidays, and her les
sons would cease till after New Year's.
y > The pricing had evidently been sat
isfactory, for. late In the afternoon,
Mariposa turned her face homeward,
her hands full of small packages. It
was one of the clear, hazeless days of
thin atmosphere, with an edge of cold,
that are â mattered through the San
Francisco winter. There is no frost In
the air, but the chill has a searching
quality which suggests winter, as does
the wild radiance of the sunset spread
over the west in a transparent wash of
red. The Invigorating breath of cold
. made the younir girl's blood glow, and
she walked rapidly along Kearny
street, the exercise In the sharp air
causing a faint, * unusual pink to- tint
her cheeks. Her Intention was to walk
to Clay street and then take the cable
car, which in those days slid slowly up
the long hills, past the Plaza and
through Chinatown.
- She was near the Plaza, when a hall
behind her fell on her ears, and turning
sSe saw Barron close on her heels, his
hands also full of small packages. He
had been at the mines for two weeks,
and she could but notice the unaffected
gladness of his greeting. She felt glad,
too, a circumstance of which, for some
occult -reason, she was ashamed, and
the shame; and the gladness combined
lent a reserved and yet conscious qual
ity to her smile and kindled a charm-
Ing embarrassment in her eye. They
stood j by the curb, he looking at her
with glances of naive admiration, while
she looked down at her parcels. Pass
ers by noticed them, setting them down,
she in her humble dress, he in his un
metropolitan roughness of aspect, as a
couple from the country, a rancher or
miner and his handsome sweetheart.
He took her parcels away from her,
and they started forward toward the
Flasa.
"Do you hear me panting?" he said,
laying his free hand on his chest.
"No, why should you pant?"
"Because J've been running all down
Kearny street for blocks after you. I
never knew 'any one to walk as fast in
my life. I thought even if I didn't
catch you you'd hear me panting be
hind you and think it was some new
kind of fire engine and turn round and
look. . ''But you never wavered â simply
'went on like a racer headed for the
goal. Did you walk so fast because you
knew I was behind you?"
She looked at him quickly with a side
glance of protest and met his eyes full
of quizzical humor and , yet with a
gleam ' of something eager and earnest
In them.

dropped: the. drum and. ran." ,
"A drum for Benito! Oh, Mr. Barron
. Han't eet 'Rp.nito n drum!"
He could not control his laughter at
sight of her expression of horrified pro
test. He laughed so loudly that people -
looked at him. She smiled herself, not
quite knowing why, and Insensibly,
both feeling: curiously light-hearted,
they drew closer together.
"What can I get?" he said. "I looked
at knives and guns, and I knew that
they wouldn't do. Benito* would cer
tainly kill Miguel and probably' grand
ma. I thought of a bat and ball, and
then I knew he'd break all the win
dows. The man in the store wanted me
to buy a bow and arrow, but I saw him
taking his revenge on the crab lady.
Benito's a serious problem any way you
take him." .
They had come to the Plaza, once an
open space of sand, round which the
wild, pioneer city swe*pt in whirlpool
currents, now already showing the
lichened brick and dropping plaster, the
sober line of house fronts, of an aging
locality. Where Chinatown backed on
the square the houses had grown ori
ental, their western ugliness, disguised
by the touch of gilding that, here and
there,. incrusted their fronts, the sway
'ing of crimson lanterns, the green zig
zags of dwarf trees. Over the top of
the Clay-street hill the west shone red
through smoke which filled the air with
a keen, acrid smell. It told of hearth
fires. And oozing out of a thousand
chimneys and streaming across the
twilight city It told of homes where the
good wife made re'ady for her man.
"Let's not take the cars," said Bar
ron. "Let's walk home. Can you man
age those hills?"
She gave a laughing assent, and they
turned upward, walking slowly as be
fitted the climb. Chinatown opened be
fore them like the mysterious, medie
val haunt of robbers in an old drawing.
The murky night was settling on It,
shot through with red gleams at the
end of streets, where the sunset pried
Into its peopled darkness. The black
ness of yawning doorways and stealthy
alleys succeeded the brilliancy of a
gilded Interior, or a lantern-lit balcony.
Strange smells were in the air, aromatic
and noisome, as though the dwellers In
this domain were concocting their
wizard brews. There was a sound ofi
shifting feet, a clatter of guttural j
voices, and a vision of faces passing
from light to shadow, marked by a
â¢weird similarity, and with eyes like
bits of onyx let into the tight-drawn i
skin. ' ; * C
The ascent was long and steep, and
they walked slowly, talking in a desul
tory fashion. Mariposa recounted the
trivial Incidents that had taken place
In the Garcia house during her com- â¢
panlon's absence. As they breasteu the )
last hill the light grew brighter, for the
sunset still lingered In a reluctant glow.
"Take my arm," said Barron. "You're
out of breath."
She took It, and they began slowly tc

DON'T MISS THIS PHOTOGRAPH.
When Tonnessen secured the beautiful ,boyj who makiqs up one of the group of fig-
ures in his latest art creation, "An Easter Offering," he found the most per-
fect subject in America. This colored photograph, which is a spiritual mas-
terpiece, will be given free with the . t h'-'k^

"You've the strangest eyes," he said,
suddenly. "Do you know what they're
the color of?"
"My father used to aay they were
like a dog's," she answered, feeling un
able to drop them and yet uneasy under
his unflinching caze.
"They'rexthe color of sherry â exactly
the same."
"I won't let you see them any more
if that's the best you can say of them,"
she said, dropping them.
"I could say they were the color of
beer," he answered, "but I thought
sherry sounded better."
"Beer!" ehe exclaimed, averting not
only her eyes, but her face. "That's an
Insult."
"Well, then, I'll only say in the sim
plest way what I think. I'm not the
kind of man who makes fine speeches â
they're the most beautiful eyes in the
world."
"That's the worst of all," she an
swered, extremely confused and not
made more comfortable by the thought
that she had brought it on herself.
"Let's leave my eyes oct of the ques
tion."
"All right I'll not speak of them
again. But I'll want to see them now
and then."
Ha sjlw her color mounting, and in
the joy of her close proximity, loiter
ing arm la arm up the sordid street,
he laughed again in his happiness and
said:
"When a person owns something
that's rare and beautiful he oughtn't
to be mean about it" *
"I suppose not" said the owner of
the rare and beautiful possessions,
keeping them sternly ont of sight
He continued to look ardently at
heft not conscious of what he was do-
Ing, his step growing slower and
slower.
"It's a long climb," he said at
length. v
"Tes." she assented. "Is that why
you're going so slowly?"
"Are we going so slowly?" he asked,
and as if to demonstrate how slow had
been their progress, they both came
to a stop like a piece of run-down ma
chinery.
They looked at each other for a
questioning moment, then burst into
simultaneous pe_ls of laughter.
One of the last and daintiest charms
that nature can give a woman is a
lovely laugh. It suggests unexplored
riches of tenderness and sweetness,
unrevealed capacity for joy and pain,
as a harsh and unmusical laugh tells
of an arid nature, hard, without juice,
devoid of imagination, mystery and
passion. Like her mother before her
Mariposa possessed this charm in its
highest form. The ripple of sound
that flowed from her lips was music,
and it cast a spell over the man at
whose side she stood, as Lucy's laugh
twenty years before had cast one over
Dan Moreau. i
"I never heard you laugh before,"
he said in delight. "What can I say
to make you do it again?"
"You didn't say anything that
time," said Mariposa. "So I suppose
he best way is for you to be silent"
Barron took hef advice and sur
veyed her mutely with dancing eyes.
For a moment her lips, puckered Into
a tremulous pout twitched with the
premonitory symptoms of a second
outburst But she controlled them,
moved by some perverse instinct of
coquetiy. while the laughter welled
op in the eyes that were fixed on him.
"I see I'll have to make a Joke," he
?aid, "and I can't think of any."
"Mrs. Garcia's got a book full. You
might borrow it"
"Couldn't you tell me one that's
made you laugh before and loan it to
me?"
"But it mightn't work a second
time. I might take it quite solemnly.
A sense of humor's a very capricious
thing."
"I think the lady who's got It is
even more so," he said.
And then once again they laughed
in concert, foolishly and gayly and
without knowing why.
They had gained the top of the hill,
and the blaze of red that swept across
tbe west shone on their faces. They
were within a few minutes' walk of
the house now and they continued,
arm in arm, aÂ« was the custom of the
day. and at the same loiterinr gait
"Didn't you tell me your people
came originally from Eldorado
County, eomewhere up near Hang
toxrn?" he asked. 'Tre Just been up
that way, and if TO. known the place
I might, hare stopped there."
"Oh, you never could have found
it," said Mariposa. hastily. "It was
only a cabin miles back in the foot
hills. My mother often told me of it
â Just a cabin by a stream. It has
probably disappeared now. My fath
er and mother met and were married
.here among the mines, and â and â I
.vas born there," she ended, stammer
ngly. hating the lies upon which her
â¢outhful traditions had been built
"If I'd known you had been born
here Td have gone on a pilgrimage to
Ind that cabin If It had taken a
nonth."
"But I tell you It can't be standing
-et I'm 24 years old â " she suddenly
ealized that this too, was part of the
-lecessary web of mlsstatement in
vhlch she was caught The color
leepened on her face into a conscious
â¢lush. She dropped her eyes, then
-aislng them to his with a curious de
iance, said: *
â¢Â«jjo_that'a a mistake. I'm â I'm â
nore than that, I'm 25. nearly 26."
Barron, who Â¦ saw nothing in the
Â¦quivocation but a girl's foolish de
*lre to understate her age, burst into
lelighted laughter, and pressing the
hand on his arm against his side, said:
"Why. I always thought you were
.ears older than that â 80 to 35 at
'.east" *
And he looked with teasing eyes
into her face. But this time Mariposa
lid not even smile. The joy had sud-
denly gone out of her, and she walked
on in silence, her head drooped, seem
ing in some mysterious way to have
grown suddenly anxious and preoc
cupied.
"There's the house," she said at
length. "I was getting tired."
"There's a light in the parlor," said
Barron. as he opened the gate. "What
can be the matter? Has Benito killed
grandma, or is there a party?"
Their doubts on this -point were
soon set at rest. Their approaching
footsteps evidently were heard by. a
listening ear within, for the hall door
opened and Benito appeared in the
aperture.
"There's a man to see you in the
parlor." he announced to Mariposa.
Inside the hallway the door on the
left that led to Mrs. Garcia's apart
ments opened and the young woman
thrust out her head, and said in a hiES
lng whisper:
"There's a gentleman waiting for
you in the parlor, Miss Moreau."
At the same time Miguel imparted
similar information from the top of
the stairs, and the Chinaman appeared
st the kitchen door and cried from
thence, with the laconic dryness pe
culiar to his race:
"One man see you. parlor."
Mariposa stood looking from one to
the other with the raised eyebrows of
inquiring astonishment. The only
person who had visitors in the Garcia
house was Pierpont, and they did' not
come at such fashionably late hours.
"He's a thin, consumpted-looking
young man with eye-glasses," said
Mrs. Garcia, curling round the Soor
the better to project the hissing whis
per she employed, "and he said he'd
wait till you came In."
Mariposa turned toward the parlor
door, leaving the family, with Barron,
on the stairs, and the Chinaman, peer
ing from the kitchen regions, watch
ing her with tense interest, as if they
half expected they would never see
her again.
Two of the gases in the old chande
lier were lit and cast a sickly light
o\-er the large room, which had the
close, musty smell of an unaired
apartment. The last relics of Senora
Oarcia's grandeur were congregated
here â bronzes that once had .cost
large sums of money, a gilt console
that had been grought from a rifled
French chateau round the Horn In a
sailing ship, a buhl Cabinet with its
delicate silvery inlaying gleaming in
the half-light, and two huge Japanese
vases, with blue and white dragons
crawling round their necks, flanking
the fireplace.
On the edge of a chair, just under
the chandelier, sat a young man. He
had his hat in his hand, and his head
drooped so that the light fell smooth
ly on the crown of blonde hair. He
looked small and meager in the sur
rounding folds of a very large and
loose ulster. As the sound of the aÂ«p
proaching step . caught his ear he
started and looked up, with the nar
rowed eyes of the near-sighted, and
then jumped to his feet. . . .
"Miss Moreau?" he said inquiringly,
and extended a long, thin hand which,
closing on hers, felt to her warm, soft
grasp like a bunch of chilled sticks.
She had not the slightest idea who he
was, and looking at him under the wan
light saw he was some one from- that
world of wealth with which she had
so few affiliations. Something about
him â the coldness of his hand, an in
describable trepidation of manner â
suggested to her that he was exceed
ingly ill at ease. She looked at him
wonderingly, and said:
"Won't you sit down?"
He sat at her bidding on the chair
he had risen from, subsiding Into the
small, shrunken figure in the middle
of enveloping folds of overcoat. One
hand hung down between his knees
holding his hat He looked at Mari
posa and then looked down at the hat.
"Cold afternoon, isn't it?" he said.
"Very cold," she responded, "but I
like It I hope you haven't been wait-
Ing long."
"Not very," he looked up at her,
blinking: near-sightedly through the
glasses; "I don't know whether you
know what my name is, Miss Moreau ?
It's Shackletonâ Winslow Shackleton.
I forgot my card."
Mariposa felt a lightning-like
change came over her face, in which
there was a sudden stiffening of her
features into something hard and re
pellent To Win, at that moment, she
looked very t like 4iia father.
"Oh!" she said, ' hearing her voice
drop at the end of the interjection
with a note of vague disapproval and
uneasiness.
"I've seen you," continued Win,
"once at The Trumpet office, when you
were there with Mrs. Willers. I don't
think you saw me. I was back in the
corner, near the table where Jack â
that's the boy â sits." ,
Mariposa murmured:
"No, I aidn't see you."
She hardly knew what he said or
-what she responded. What did this
mean? What was going to happen
now?
"You must excuse my coming. this
way, without an introduction or any
thing, but as you knew my father and
mother, I â I â thought you wouldn't
mind."
He glanced at her again, anxiously,
she thought and she said suddenly,
with her habitual directness:
"Did you come from your mother?"
"No, I came on â on â my own hook.
I wanted"â he looked vaguely about
and then laid his hat on a table near
him â VI wanted to see you on busi
ness of my own."
The nervousness from which he was
evidently suffering began to communi
cate^ itself to Mariposa. The Shackle
ton 'family had come to mean every
thing that was painful and agitating
to her, and here' was a new one want
ing to talk to her about business that
she knew, past a doubt,- was of some
unusual character.
"If you've "come to talk to me about
going to Europe," (She said desperate-
ly. "I may as well tell you, there's no
use. I won't go to Paris now, as I
once said I would, and there's no good
trying to make me change my mind.
Your mother /and Mrs. Willers have
both tried to. and it's very Tdnd of
them, but Iâ can't.".
She had an expression at once of
fright and determination. . The sub
ject was becoming a nightmare to her, '
and she saw herself attacked again
from a strange quarter, and with, she
imagined, a new. set of arguments.
"It's nothing to do with going to
Europe," he said. ' "It's â It's" â he put
up one of* the .long, bony* hands, and
with the two first lingers pressed hi3
glasses back against his eyes, then
dropped the hand and stared at Mari
posa, the eyes looking strangely pale
and prominent behind the powerful
lenses. A
"It's something that's just between
you and me," he said.
She surveyed him without answer
ing, her brows drawn, her mind con
centrated on him and on . what he
could mean.
"Do you want me to teach somebody
music?" she said, wondering if this
could be the pleasant solution of the
enigma.
"No. The â er â the business I've
come to talk to you about ought to do
away .altogether with the. necessity of
your giving lessons."
They looked at each othar silently
for a moment Win was' conscious
that his hands were/trembling, and
that his mouth, was dry. He rose
from his chair and mechanically
reached for his hat. When he had
started on his difficult errand he had
been certain that she knew her rela
tionship* to his father. Now the
dreadful thought entered" his mind
that perhaps she did not And even Is
she did, it was evident that-she.was
not going to give him the least help.
, "What* is the business you've come
to see me about?" f she asked. -
"It's a question of money," he an
swered, i â¢ - v
"Money!" ejaculated Mariposa, in
baffled amaze. "What money? Why?" !
He glanced desperately Into his hat
and then back at her. She saw the
hat trembling in his hand and sud
denly realized that this man was try
ing to say something that was agita
ting him to the marrow of his being.
"Mr. Shackleton," she said, rising to
her feet, "tell me what. you mean. I
don't understand. I'm completely at
sea. How can there be any question
of money between us when I've never
seen you or met you before? Explain
it all."
He dropped the hat to his side and
said slowly, looking her straight in the
face: â¢â¢
"I want to give you a share of the
estate left me by my father. I look
upon it as yours." ; - ; Â¦â¢- -
There was a pause. He . saw her
paling under his gaxe, and realized
that whatever she might pretend, she
knew. His heart bled for her.
"As mine!" she said in a low, un
certain voice. "Why?".
"Because you have a right to it."
There was another pause. He
moved close to her and said, in a voice
full of a man's d3ep kindness:
"I can't explain any more. Don't
ask It. Don't let's bother anything in
the background. It's just the present,
that's our affair."
He suddenly dropped his .hat and
took her hand. It was as cold as. his
had been. He pressed It, and Mari
posa, looking dazedly at him, saw a
grleitm like tears behind the glasses.
"It's hateful to have you living here
like this, while we â that is, while
other people^^-have everything. I
can't stand It It's too mean and un
fair. I want you to share with me."
She shook her head, looking down,
a hundred thoughts bursting in upon
her brain. What did he know? How
had he found it out? In his grasp, her
hand trembled pitifully.
"Don't ''shake your hea<d," *ie .
pleaded, "It's so hard to say it Don't
turn it down before you've heard -no-
OUt."
"And It's hard to hear it," 3he mur
mured. .
"No one knows anything of this but
me." he continued, "and I promise you
that no other, ever: shall. It'll be just
between us as between" â he paused
and then added with a voice that was
husky â "as between brother and sis
ter.'.'
She shook her head again, deling
*for the moment too upset is .?peak,
and tried to draw away from him.
But he put his other hand on her
Bhoulder and held her.
"I'll go halves with you. I oan have
it all arranged so that no one wili ever
find out. I can't make th.- 5 regular
partition of the property until the end
of the year. But, until then, I'll sen 1
you what would be vour j Interest,
monthly,' and you can live where) or
how you like. Iâ I can't go on
knowing things,, and ' thinking - 1 you

Ing music."
"I can't do it," she .said, in a stran
gled undertone, and pulling her hand
out of his grasp. "I can't. It's not
possible. I can't take money that Was
your father's."
"But it's not hisâ it's mine now/
Don't let what's dead and buried com '.
up and interfere."/
She backed away from him, still
shaking her head. She made an ef
fort toward a cold composure, but her
pain f seemed to show more clearly
through it. He looked at her, VivÂ»rd,
irresolute, wrung with p'.'.y. that he
knew she would not permit him to ox
press.
It was impossible for them' to. un
derstand each other. 3hÂ», with, her
secret knowledge of her ritother'o law
ful claim and her own legitimacyâ he
regarding her as the. wronged child of
his father's sin. In her 4:t>:iMl dis
tress she only half-grnpo i what h^
thought. The strongest fecllns she
had was once again to tlie toils
that these terrible peoi>Â«.Â». who hstd so
wronged her mother, were 'spreading
for her. They, wanted to pay her to
redeem the strain on their past. â¢
"Money can't set right what was
wrong,", she said. "Money can't
KQuare things between your { family
and mine."
"Money can't square anythingâ I
don't want it <o. I'm not trying to
square things; I've not thought about
it that way at all. I just wanted you
to have it because it seemed all wrong
for youNiot to. You had a right, just
as -; I hrid. and Maud had. I don't
think I've thought much about it,
anyway, it just came to me that you
ou.^lit to have what was yours. I
wouldn't make you feel bad for. the
world."
"Then remember, once and forever,
that I take nothing from you or your
people. I'd rather beg than take
money that came from your father."
"But he has nothing to do with it.
It's mine now. I've done you no in-
Jury, and It's I that want you to take
it. Won't you take it from me?"
He spoke-simply, almost wistfully,
like a little Doy. Mariposa answered:
"Noâ Oh, Mr. Shackleton. why
don't you . and your people let me
alone? I won't tell. I'll keep it all a
.secret. But your mother torments me
to go to Europe â and now you come!
If I were starving, I wouldn't â I
couldn't â take anything from any of
you. I think you're kind. I think
you've just come to-day because you
were sorry. But don't talk about it
any more. Let me be. Let me go
along teaching here where I belong.
Forget me. Forget that you ever saw
me. Forget* the- miserable tie of
blood there Is between us." *
"That's the thit?g I .can't forget.
That's the thing that worries me. It's
not the past. I've nothing to do with
that. It's the present that's my af
fair. I can't have everything while
you -have nothing. It don't seem to
'me It's like a manto act that way. It
goes against me, anyhow. I don't of
fer you this because of anything in the
past; that's my- father's affair. I don't
know anything about it. I offer it be
cause I â I â I" â he stammered over
the unfamiliar, words and finally
jerked out â " because I want to give
back what belongs to/you. That's all
there is to It Please take it." ,
She lopked directly into his eyes and
said, gravely: -
I "No. 'jÂ«nv sorry if it's a disappoint
ment, bu^lVcan't." S4
Then "sbVsBddenly looked down, her
face began* to quiver, and she said in a
broken undertone:
"Don't talk about it any more; it
hurts ma so."
Win turned quickly away from her
and picked up his hat. He was con
fused "and disappointed, J and relieved,
too, for he had done the most difficult
piece of work of his life. But, at the
moment, his, most engrossing feeling
was sympathy for this girl, so bravely
drawing her pride together over the
bleeding of her heart.
' : \ She~ murmured a response in a
steadier voice and he turned toward
fier. Had any of his society friends
been by they would hardly have
known him. The foolish manner be
hind which he sheltered his shy and
sensitive nature was gone. He was
grave and looked very much of a man.
"Well, of course, it's fer you to say
what you want. But there's one thing
I'd like you to promise."
"To promise?" she said uneasily.
"Yes, and to keep it, too. And* that
is, if you ever want anythingâ help in
any way; if you get blue in your
spirits, or some one's not doing the
straight thing by. you, or gone back on
you â to come to me. I'm not much In
some ways, but I guess I could be of
use. And, anyway, it's good for a girl
to have some friend that she can
count on, who's a man. And" â he
paused with the door handle in his
hand â "and now you know me, any
way, and, that's something. Will you
promise?"
"Yes, I'll promise that," said Mari
posa, and moving toward him she
gave him her hand.
He pressed it, dropped itf and
opened the door. A moment later
Mariposa heard the hall door bang be
hind him. She sat flown in the chair
from which she had risen, her hand3
lying idle in. her lap. her eyes on a
rose in the carpet,, trying to think,' to
understand what it meant
CHAPTER XVIII.
WITH ME TO HELP.
"Look In my face, m; nime is â Mlrht Have
Hfen'.
I em alro called. No More. Too Late. Fare
well."' , , Â¦ . â Rossettl.
Had Essex realized that Mrs. Will
ers was an adverse agent in his suit
of Mariposa. he would not have
greeted her with the urbane courte
ousness that marked their meeting?.
He was a man of many manners, and
he never would have wasted one of
his best on the newspaper woman, to
him essentially uninteresting and un
attractive, unless he had intended
thereby to further his own ends. Mrs.
Willers- he knew to be a friend * of
Mariposa and he thought it a wisi*
policy' to keep it* her good graces. He
made that mistake, so often- the un
doing of those whoare unscrupulous
and clever, of not crediting Mrs. Will
ers with her full amount of brains.
He had seen her foolish side, and- he
knew that she was a good journalist
of the hustling, energetic, unlntellect
ual type, but he saw no deeper.
Since their meeting in the park and
her unequivocal rejection of him hJs
feeling for Mariposa had- augmented
in force and fire until It had full pos
session of him; He was of> the order
: of, men whom ' easy -'^conquests cool.
Now added to the girl's own change of
front wag the overwhelming Induce
ment of the wealth she represented.
His original idea of Mariposa us a
Â¦handsome misfress that he would take
to France and there uut on the opera
tic stage, of whom he would be the
proud owner, while they toured Eu
rope together, her voice and beauty
charming kings, had been abandoned
since the night of his tilk with*Har
ney. He would marry her, and, with
her completely under his dominion, hâ¢
would turn upon the Shackleton es
tate and make her claim. He sup
posed .her to be in entire ignorance of
her parentage,, and hig first idea had
been to marry her and not lighten thi^
ignorance till she was safely in hi\
power. 'He had a feur of her shrink
ing before the hazards of the enter
prise, but he was confident that, once
his, all scruples, timidity and will
would give way before him.
But her refusal of him had upset
these^calculatlons, and her coldness
and repugnance had been as oil to the
flame of his passion. He was enraged
with himself and with her. He
thought of the night in the cottage
and cursed himself for his precipita
tion, and his gods for the ill luck that,
too late, hail revealed to him her rela
tionship to the dead millionaire. At
first he had thought the offer of mar
riage would obliterate all unpleasant
memories. But her manner th-it day
in the park had frightened him. It
was not the haughty mmner, adopted
to conceal hidden fires, of the woman
who still loves. There had been a
chill poise about her that suggested
complete withdrawal from his influ
ence.
â¢ Since then he had cogitated much.
He foresaw that it was going to be very
difficult to see and have speech of
her. An occasional walk up Third
street to Sutter with Mrs. Willer3 kept
him informed of her movements and
doings. Had he guessed that Mrs.
Willers, with her rouge higher up on
one cheek than the other, the black
curls of her bang oprawlingly pressed
against her brow by a spotted veil.
was quite conversant with his preten
sions and their non-suocess. he would
have been more guarded in his exhi
bition pf Interest. As it was Mrs.
Willers wrote to Mariposa after one of
these walks In which Essex's ques
tions had been carelessly numerous
and frank, and told her that he was
still "camped on her trail, and for
goodness' sake not to weaken." Mari
posa tore up the letter v.ith an angry
ejaculation.
"Not to weaken!" she said to her
self. If she had only dared to tell
Mrs. Willers the whole instead of half
the truth! "
The difficulty of seeing Mariposa
was further intensified by the fullness
of his own days. He had little time
to spare. The new proprietor worked
his people for all there was in them
and paid them well. Several times on
the regular weekly holiday the supe
rior men on The Trumpet were given,
he loitered along streets where she
had been wont to pass. But he never
saw her. The chance that had fa
vored him- that once In the^iark was
not repeated. * Mrs"- Willers said she
was very busy. Essex began to won
der if she suspected him of lying In
wait for her and was taking her walks
along unfrequented byways.
Finally, after Christmas had passed
and he had still not caught a glimpse
of her, he determined to see her in the
only way that seemed possible. He
had inherited certain traditions of
good breeding from his mother, and it
offended this streak of delicacy and
decency that was still faintly discerni
ble In his character to intrude upon a
lady who had so obviously shown a
distaste for his society. But there wa's
nothing else for it. Interests that
were vital were at stake. Moreover,
his desire, for love's sake, to see her
again was overmastering. Her face
came between him and his work.
There were nights when he stood op
posite the Garcia house "watching for
her shadow on the blind.
He timed his visit at an hour when,
according to the information ex
tracted from Mrs. Willers, Mariposa's
last pupil for the day should have left.
He loitered about at the corner of the
street and saw ,the pupil â one of the
grown-up ones in a sealskin sack and
a black Gainsborough hat â open the
gate and sweep majestically down the
street. Then he strode from his coi?n
of vantage, stepped lightly up the
stairÂ», and rang 1 ' the bell.
It was after school hours, and BÂ»ni
to opened the door. Essex, in his silk
hat and long, dark overcoat, tall and
distinguished, was bo much more Im
pressive a figure than Win that the lit
tle boy stared at him in overawed sur
prise, and "only found his breath when
the stranger demanded Miss Moreau.
"Yes, she's in." said Benito, back
ing away toward the stair3; "I'll call
her. She has quite a lot of callers
sometimes," he hazarded pleasantly.
The door near by opened a crack,
airid a female voice issued therefrom in
a suppressed tone of irritation.
".'Benito, v.hy don't you thow th*
gentleman into the parlor?"
"He'll go in if he wants," said Be
nito, who evidently had d?cided that
the stranger knew how to take care of
himself; "that's the door."
Essex, who was conscious that the
eye which pertained to the voice was
surveying him intently through' the
crack, did as he was bidden and found
himself in the close, musty parlor. It
was late in the afternoon, and tha
long lace curtains draped over tha
windows obscured the light. He
wanted to see Mariposa plainly and he
looped, the curtains back against the
brass hooks. His heart was beating
hard with expectation. As he. turned
round to look at the door he noticed
that the key was in the lock, and re
solved, with a sense of grim deter-
mination. that if she tried to go when
she saw who it was. he could be be
fore her and turn the key.
Upstairs Benlto had found Mariposa
sitting in front of the fire. She had
been giving lessons most of the day
and was tired. She stretched "herself
like a sleepy cat as he came. in. and
put her hand up to her hair, pushing
In the loosened hairpins.
"It's some one about lessons, I
guess,'" she said, rising and giving a
hasty look in the glass. "At this rate.
Ben, I'll soon be rich."
She was in good spirits at the pros
pects of a new pupil, and. with her
hand on the door-knob, threw Benlto
a farewell smile, which was still on
her lips as she entered.
It remained there for a moment, for
at the first glance she did not recog
nize Essex, who was standing with his
back to the panes of the unveiled win
dows; then he moved toward her and
she saw who It was.
She gave a smothered exclamation
and drew back.
"Mr. Essex!" she said; "why do you
come here?"
He had intended to meet her with
his customary half impudent, half ca
joling suavity, but found that he could
not. The sight of her filled him with
fiery agitation.
"I c;ime because I couldn't kepp
away," he said, advancing with his
hand out.
"No," she said, glancing at the hand
and turning her head aside with an im
patient movement; "there can't be any
pretenses at friendship between us. I
don't want to shake hands with you.
I den't want to see you. What did you
corr.e for?"
"To see you. I had to see you."
His- eyes, fixed on her as she stood
in the light of the window, seemed to
italicize the words of the' sentence.
"There's no use beginning that sub
ject again," she said hurriedly;
"there's no us* talking about those
things."
"What thing's? What are you refer
ring to?"
For a moment she felt the old help
less feeling coming over her. but she
forced it aside and said, looking stead
ily at him:
"The thing3 we talked about In the
park the last time we met."
She saw his dark face flush. He was
too much in earnest now to be able to
assert his supremacy by teasing equiv
ocations.
"Nevertheless, I've come to-day to
repeat those things."
"Don'tâ don't," she said quickly;
"there's no use. I won't listen to th<Â»m.
It's not polite to Intrude into a lady's
house and try to talk about subject*
she detests."
"The time has passed for us to be
polite or lmpt/llte." he answered hotly;
"we're not the' man and woman as so
ciety and the world has made them.
We're not speaking to each other
through the veils of conventionality:
we're speaking face to face. We have
hearts and souls and passions. We've
loved each other."
"Never," she said; "never for a mo
ment."
"You have a bad memory," he an
swered slowly; "Is It natural or culti
vated?"
He had the satisfaction of seeing her
color rise. The sight sent a thrill of
hope through him. He moved nearer
to her and said in a voice that vibrated
with feeling:
"Yc-u loved me once.**
"No, never, never. It^was never
that/'
"Then why." he answered, his lips
trying to twist themselves into a. sar
donic smile, while rage possessed him.
"why did you â let us sayâ encourage
me so that night in the cottage on Pine
street?"
Though her color burned deeper, her
eyes did not drop. He had never seen
her dominating her own girlish im
pulses like this. It seemed to- remove
her thousands of miles fiym the circle
of his power.
"I'll tell you," she answered; "I was
lonely and miserable, and you seemed
the only c ature that I had to care for.
I thought you were fond of me, and I
thought it wM wonderful that any one
as clever as you could really care for
me. That you regarded me as you did
I could no more have imagined than I
could have suspected you of pit-kins my
pocket or murdering me. And that
night in the cottage, when in my lone
liness and distress I seemed to- be
holding cut my arms to you, asking you
to protect and comfort me, you laughed
at me and struck me a blow in the
face. It was the end of my dream. 1
wakened then and saw tbe reality. . But
you â you as you are â as I know you
nowâ I never loved, I never could have
loved." : ,.-â¢Â¦ Â¦;.--Â¦>. .

The Unit Books," has aroused the
curiosity of bibliolaters. First there
came "The Marble Faun," then "Let
ters and Addresses of " Abraham
Lincoln," to be followed by the
recently published "Tales of Mys
tery" of Edgar Allan Poe and George
William Curtis' "Prue and I."" The
volumes are printed In broad-faced
type upon a soft, white paper, bound
in paper, cloth and leather â very
handy, very attractive and very cheap.
The unit system upon which they are
sold is what will interest book buyers,
for it is unique. Says the publisher:
"Our books are sold at prices based
on the length of the book and there
fore on the actual cost of production.
However long the original text, we
publish It in Its entirety on a uniform
quality of paper and in the same size
of type. We begin /with our unit of
twenty-five pages. The price of each
set of twenty-five pages is 1 cent. The
price of 100 pages is 4 cents and each
additional twenty-five pages adds 1
cent to the price. Thus, 250 pages cost
10 cents and 400 pages cost 16 cents.
A paper wrapper is given with the
printed pages. The cloth cover costs
30 cents additional. The full leather
binding costs 50 cents additional. The
price of a single volume is regulated
by the number of units it contains and
by the binding you choose." â¢
Thus one may buy his classics as ha
would his plain smoked or sugar cured
hams. The publisher assures us that
these additions are not piracies, but
since that is a matter solely for the
publisher's conscience, the reader need
not worry himself over it The books

book seated as Assistant Secretary of
the Navy Riis has an opportunity to
deal with the oft-raised criticism that
Roosevelt was with the Jingoes who
urged war with Spain for. war's sake.
"The war was a moral issue with
him," writes Kiis, "as^indeed it was
with all of us who understood. It was
with such facts as these (stories of re
concentrados' sufferings)â and there
was no lack of themâ in mind and
heart that he responded hotly to Sen
ator Hanna pleading for peace for the
sake of the country's commerce and
prosperity, that much as he appre
ciated those blessings, the honor of the
country was of more account than tern- j
porary business prosperity. It has
slipped my mind what was the partic
ular occasion â some club gathering â
but I have not forgotten the profound
impression the Naval Secretary's words
made as he insisted that our country
could better afford to lose a thousand of
the bankers thathaVe added to its wealth
than one Farragut;-that it were better
for it never to have had all the rail
road magnates that have built it up,
great as is their deserving, than to
have lost Grant and Sherman; better
that it had never known commercial
greatness than that it should miss
from its history one Lincoln. .Unless
the moral overbalance the material, we
are indeed riding for a fall in all our>
pride."
Riis adds nothing to the account 'of
Roosevelt's part in the hostilities In
Cuba that has not already been writ-^
ten. It Is with him in the Governors*
chair of New York that the author finds
the place to define Roosevelt's theories
concerning the party and the machine.
"I am a loyal party man, but I believe
very firmly that I can best render aid
to my party by doing all that in me^
lies to .make that party responsive to
the needs of the State, responsive to
the needs of the people." With these
words Roosevelt himself has defined his
allegiance to the organization he rep
resents. Rlis shows that the Governor
of New York had associated himself
with the party machine Just so far as
by it he might be enabled to effect good
ends. But "he had built up no machine
of his own. He had used that which
he found to the uttermost of its bent
and of his abilityâ not always with the
good will of the managers, but he had
used it for the things he had in mind,
telling the bosses that for all other
legitimate purposes, for organization,
for power, they might have It; he
should not hinder them."
Roosevelt's policy In the .White
House, his handling of the many mo
mentous questions which have come up
to him for solution, is beyond the scope
of Riis* work; that is material for edi
torial and historical review rather than
tor a work upon the man himself. Sat
isfying himself with the analysis of
Roosevelt's characteristics of thought
and action as shown in his incumbency
in other offices! Rlis does not permit
his book to assume the character of
campaign material by commenting on
Presidential policies.
The great store of anecdote'concern
ing Roosevelt's home life and his at
tributes as head of a family, sportsman
and writer, which, perforce, ' have been
omitted from this review on account
of the political significance of the book,
all serve to show the many-sidedness
of the man and are indicative of;
his remarkable personality. To Roose
velt/as a friend Riis offers this whole
hearted testimony:
"I think I neys-f knew a man who so
utterly trusts a friend, once he has
taken him to his heart That he does
not do easily or offhand; but once he
has done it there is no reservation or
secret drawback to his friendship. It
is a splendid testimony to x the real
worth of human nature that his trust,
has rarely indeed been betrayed. Once
his friend, you are his friend forever.
To the infallible test he rings true;
those who love him best are those who
know him best The men who hate
him are the scalawags and the self
seekers, and they only distrust him
who do not know him. He never lost
a friend once made."

was Dr. William Pepper, provost and
recreator of the University of Pennsyl
vania, founder of the University Hos

Free Library of Philadelphia, munici
pal reformer, public benefactor, scien

a sublimely unselfish avowpl from such
a man, unselfish even in Uhe â¢ face of

i. .on the flyleaf of his biography,
written by Francis Newton Thorpe.
For this keynote of Dr. Pepper's life is
the keynote of this book on his j life';
unselfishness In remarkable endeavor
for the good of others.
The biographer has a strong call for
the "writing of a life such as was that
of William Pepper. Representative, of
all that Is best in the Americanâcul
ture, exalted ideals and a lofty pur
pose, an examplar of the restless and
all absorbing spirit of doing, a reflec

Pepper's life presents an ideal for the
exaltation of every man's conception

manifold interests which crowded
themselves upon the consideration of
Pennsylvania's provost r.nd despite 4he
many divergent' channels into which
his activities were turned, the man.
whom Thorpe pictures appears singular
ly to be the manifestation of just that
one element, unselfishness. All of his
attributes, faithfully chronicled by his
biographer, contributed to that domi- '

to be agitated a hospital to be under

a place held' by him until the exi
gencies of declining health forced him
to surrender It in later years. The
story of the multitudinous reforms,-in
novations and improvements made by
the provost during his long term of
office is the story . of , Pennsylvania's
elevation into the rank of one of the
"Big Four" among â¢ Eastern universi
ties. The biographer shows:
For the city of Philadelphia Dr.
Pepper's efforts were* equally, tireless.
In 1891 he inaugurated a movement
looking toward the establishment of
a. free public library. . BuÂ£j to bring
about a successful fruition of his
plans Dr. Pepper had to meet Coun

from the Legislature and work inde

corruption while President of the Po
lice Commissioners of New York Riis
has already written in his "Making of
an American." With the subject of bis
It was in his labors as Civil . Service
Commissioner that Riis finds Roosevelt
exhibiting the qualities which won for
htm the name of being a fearless fighter
for clean service in public office.
"With characteristic directness," says
RUs, "he was laying down the way of
life to the boys and girls in his class
â¢when an untoward event happened.
One of his boys came to school with
a black eye. He owned up that ha had

eide his sister, had been pinching her

came out ther had a stand-up fight
and be punched him good, bearing
away the black eye as his share. The
verdict was prompt.
"'You did perfectly right,* said his
teacher, and he gave him a dollar."
Roosevelt's first tilt at politics was as
an Assemblyman in the Legislature of
New York, where, though a graduate
from college of barely a year, the young
exponent of "the- ten commandments
in politics" stood out for eight days
alone In determined attack upon the
Attorney General of the State and a
Judge of the Supreme Court for corrup
tion, until he finally swung the oppo
sition over his way. His fearless can
dor in attack In this instance Is called
by Riis the deciding act in his career.
This made him politically, notwith
standing the disgruntled politicians,
who were not used to doing things that
nay, and from Speaker of the Assem
bly at 24 he became Non-Partisan can
didate for Mayor of New York. He was
defeated, as everybody knows, but, as
Riis says, "he had contributed some
thing: to that campaign that had life
in it." "Â¦'SSaE&Ss
This. then, is the seai of "Theodore
Roosevelt the -Citizen" â to show the
man from his every side, his qualities
which make him a good father, a good
friend, a good citizen and from these,
a rood President. Riis shows how it
is that the President who boldly op
posed the trusts in the anthracite coal
strike of the winter of 1902 acted bo
because Roosevelt, the Police Commis
sioner of New York, had scattered the
boodlers* ring in Mulberry street in
18S5. He reveals the natal forces of
the man, the Innate depth of character
and strength of will which impels him
to act, whether as Civil Service Com
misslnner, colonel of Rough RiderB or
President of the United States. 1 He
analyzes Roosevelt's methods of
thought and action so that behind the
oft criticized "impulsiveness" of the
President one is allowed to see the
swift, sure grasp of intellect which
weighs carefully yet expeditiously
every question before action is deter
mined upon. As Riis truthfully says,
he has only to show Roosevelt the man
and Roosevelt the President will be
disclosed. \
Roosevelt's boyhood days present no
more interesting material to the author
than do those of any other men for
thtlr biographers. There has been a
goodly store of anecdote about,Roose
velt's college days at Harvard, but Riis
adds to it with the following story of
how the young scholar, who had be
come a teacher in an Episcopal Sun
day school, rewarded bravery to tha
detriment of his position as an expon
ent of holy peace:
"There remains to 'me to sr>eak of
him as the friend, the man. And this
is what I shall do, the more cladly
because so may it be my privilege to
introduce him to some who know him
only as the public man. the President,
the "partisan perhapsâ and a very en
ergetic partisan he isâ and so really do
not know him at all, in the sense which
I have in mind. The public man I will
follow because he is square, and will
do the square thing always, not mere
ly want to do it. With the partisan I
will sometimes disagree, at least I
Â¦ought to, for I was before a Democrat
and would be one now if the party
would get some sense and bar Tam
many out in the cold for its mon
strous wickedness. Of the President
I am proud with reason, but the friend
1 love. And if I can make you see him
bo, as a friend and a man. I have given
you the master-key to him as a states
man as well. You will never need to
ask any questions."
â¢"Why have I written it?" asks Ril*.
â¢â¢Just to boom Roosevelt for the Presi
dency in the election that comes soon?
Nu, not that. It matters less that
Theodore Roosevelt is President, but it
matters a good deal that the things
prevail which he represents in the na
tion's life. It never mattered more
than at this present day of oursâ right
Â¦ ACOB A. RIIS has written a
j book about an Ideal American
I citizen, that citizen being none
I other than the highest citizen in
Â§ the United States â Theodore
Roosevelt, the President It is
frankly a book of adulation, for it is
from Jacob Rlis, than whom President
Roosevelt has no more stanch friend
and true admirer. It Is equally as
frankly largely a personal record, for
Jacob Riis has had probably a closer
intimacy and a nearer affiliation with
President Roosevelt than any other
Irian in public life. It is above all else
a ketn, clear cut study of the wonder
fully versatile, tremendously forceful
m&n who now directs the state. Adu
lation there is in â¢'Theodore Roosevelt
the Citizen." because adulation cannot
justly be withheld by any reviewer of
the subject The personal note sound
ed throughout the work does but give
emphasis of authorityâ the authority
which has seen and which knows. Other
books upon Roosevelt have been writ
ten and will be written, but none will
give the living, breathing picture of
the man that Riis does.

great whose glory does not disappear
by contact with them; in fact he is
greatest and noblest at short range.
His speech has none of the hardness
which rings so unpleasantly in his writ
ings, his voice has that tender ton*
which woos and wins one."
The author plans his book not after
a rigli adherence to chronological fact*
in the life of Tolstoy, but with a pur
pose, rather, of tracing the growth and
development of hia subject's Intellect- j?
ual and spiritual life. Tolstoy as the
sensitive, dreaming child, dubbed "Phil
osopher" by his fellows, and himself
knowing not what it was In him that
made him the ugly duckling of tha
family and the school, rapidly become*
the landed proprietor with humanita
rian aspirations, and then the de
bauchee. The author then gives us a
glimpse of Tolstoy, the young soldier,
who had first begun to write and to
whom this philosophy, rudiment of
what was to be. builded on In later
years, had come:* "First, the purifi
cation and development of self through
casting off the prejudices and evil ef
fects of our culture, and secondly, that
where such culture has not penetrated
we find the virtues which society must
make Its own for the sake of Its true
growth and salvation." This, then, tha
author finds to be the first fruits of
Tolstoi's budding genius for philosoph- "
ical creation. From these primal ut
terancss of the philosopher- to-be Stein
er leads the subject of his work oa
from strength to strength, outlining tha
Influences which came to shape tha
mind of the writer and sketching by
analysis of his successive works tha
growth of his scheme for tha solution
of the life problem,
"He walked through Italy Ilka aa
iconoclastic Ffcritan; so full of thoughts
of man's sins and man's sufferings thai
hardly a ray of its matchless beauty
penetrated those sharp, half closed
eyes, shaded by a knitted brow." In
Switzerland an Incident of a, begY&r
musician who received no dola for his
strains of harmony "proved to Tolstoy
that culture has destroyer*. In man his
simple, natural and original feallng to
ward others." His story. "Family Hap
piness." was an attempt to found a
. theory of marriage based upon a spir
itual exaltation. The death of a broth
er caused him to mourn that Ufa la
terrible, art is a lie and truth Is awful.
Thus was the flickering pressure of~^
passing circumstance registered upon
the delicate barometer of Tolstoy'a
mind until Steiner finds him In tha
depths of agnosticism just prior to tha
writing of "Anna Karenina."
That powerful tragedy with Its keen
study of the whole gamut of class, so
cial development and human character,
marks for Steiner the parting of the
ways for Tolstoy, "the Iconoclast and
hedonist. "Not unlike Solomon," writes
Steiner, "having tasted of all that the
world could give him, Tolstoy cries
out: 'Vanity of vanities, all Is vanity.'
'What profit hath a man of all his
labor which he taketh under the sun?* 'â¢
To priests and theologians Tolstoy
turned for a ray of light In his dark
ness, but he- found that their lives be
lled their professions. Then at last ha
found what his heart desired in tha
peasants whom alone he thought to
be reallv conversant with God through
their simple lives. Then came the Tol
stoy of the peasant's frock and bars
feet, the Tolstoy of the new sociological
religion of "the law of Jesus."
In his review of the philosophy of
Tolstoy Steiner takes the view that ths^
Russian novelist has no desire tÂ»
proselyte In favor of the revelation ha
thinks to ba his nor to be a second
John tha Baptist to make straight tha
way of tha Lord. On the other hmd. _
ha Is certain that Tolstoy's scheme of

This â¢ is also referred to by A. F.
Dean, in his lecture on "Fire Insur
ance." After noticing the great bene
fits German students and apprentices
pained in the days of old when looking
about their fatherland during; their
wanderjahr, he draws attention to the
fact that "the American student seldom
has a wanderjahr or Journey of Inspec
tion. He Â¦ is generally lassoed fresh
from school, bridled, saddled and put
to work under the merciless spur oÂ£
necessity." The lecturer says that a
good commercial school that acquires
the occasional services of lecturers,
practically engaged In commercial oc
cupations, may take the place of tha
wanderjahr and may instruct the stu
dent by means of lectures and a com
plete portrayal of the leading: indus
tries of tha country.
Some noteworthy statements are
made In a lecture on ' "Methods of
Banking" by James H. Eckles, pres
ident of the Commercial National Bank
of. Chicago. According to Eckles, the
loaning of money by banks on real
estata mortgages is a positive source
of danger. Many of the leading Chi
cago banks refuse to undertake this
risk and some modern banks are pro
hibited by their charters from issuing
any loans en real estate. Experience
has shown that the safest and best se
curities are commercial bjlls. Nowa
days, business men of the larger firms
do not borrow direct from a bank, but
from commercial note broken and dis
counters. The result is that they do
not know what bank supplies the
money. They get a check from the
note broker; when the note becomes
due thev are notified by the. Institu
tion then holding it. This system,
which has grown to large proportions
recently, has greatly enlarged the in
fluence of banks and has been highly
beneficial to the banks themselves.

That's how Darby O*G1U bÂ«gan his
six months' stay with the Good People.
Net a thing was left undone to make
Darby contented and happy. A dvller
people than the Good People he never
met. At first he couldn't get over say-
Ing. "God save aU here" and "God save
you kindly," and things'llke that, which
was like burning them with a hot Iron.
If it weren't for Maureen McGibney,
Darby would be In Slelve-na-mon at
this hour. On a day wherr they two
were sitting alone together she says to
him:
"Darby, dear." says she, "it Isn't
right for a dacint man of family to be
gpendln* his days covortin* and Idlln*
an* fillln* the hours with gport and non

"Throe for ye!" moantd Darby, "and

"I know how weii you feel." gays
Maureen, "for I'd give the world to say

passage, which grew lighter as he went
along. He heard the opening behind'
shut like a trap, and his heart almost
stepped beating, for this was tht
fairies' home In the heart of Sleive-na
non. He was captured by them!
When Rosie stopped so stiff were all
Darby's joints that he had great
trouble loosening himself to come down.
He landed among a lot of angry-faced
little people, each no higher than your
hand, every one wearing & green velvet
cloak and a red cap. and In every cap
was stcck a white owl's feather.
"We'll take him to the King." says a

With that they marched ear bould
Darby, a prisoner, down the long pas
sage, which every second grew wider
and lighter and fuller of little people.
Sometimes. though, he met with hu
man beings IiJce_hrlniself. only the black
charm was on them, they having been
stolen at some time by the Good Peo
ple. He saw lost people there from
every parish In Ireland, both common
ers and gentry. Each was "laujhins,
talking and diverting himself with an
other. Off to the aides he could see
small cobblers making brogues, tinkers
raendinff pans, tailors sewing 1 cloth,
smiths hammering horseshoes, every
one merrily to his trade, making a di
rarslon out of work."
'Down near the center of the moun

room there arose the sound of a reel

could hardly make his feet behave
themselves.
At the room's ed?e Darby stopped
short and caught his breath, the sight
was so entrancing. Set over the broad
fiocr were thousands and thousands of
the Gocd People, facing this way and
that, dancing to a reel; while on a throne
in the middle of the room sat ould
Brian Connors. King of the Fairies,
blowing on the bagpipes. The little
King, with a goold crown on hia head,
wearing a be'autiful green velvet coat
and rÂ«d knee breeches, sat with his
less crossed, beating time with his foot
to the music.
There were many from Darby's own
parish; and what was his surprise to
see there Maureen McGibney. his own
wife's sister, whom he had supposed
resting dacintly in "her own grave ;n
holy ground these three years.
As I tould you before, I tell you
again. Darby was the finest reel dancer
in all Ireland; and he came from a
family of dancers, though I say it who
shouldn't, as he was my mother's own
cousin. Three things In the worruld

melted a little. Darby's feet led him in
to the thick of the throng, right under
the throne of th* King, where he flung
care to the winds and put his heart and
mind into his two nimble feet. Dar
by's dancing was Â«uch that purty soon

It wasn't long tin half the dancers
crowded around admiring, clapping
their hands, and shouting encourage
ment. The ould King grew so excited
that he laid down the pipes, took up
his fiddle, came down frgm the throne,
and standing ferninst Darby, began &
finer chune than the first.
The dancing lasted a whole hour, no
one speaking a word except to cry out,
"Foot it, ye divtl!" "Aisy now, he's
threading on flowers!" "Hooroo! hoo
roo! hooray I" Then the King stopped
and said:
"Well, that bates Banagher. and Ban
agher bates the worruld! Who are you
and how came ycu here?"
Then Darby up and tould the whole
story.

"Cruel man I" Â«hÂ» cried, "don't yoa
know that to say pious ward* to one of
the Good People, or to one nndher their
black charm, is like cutting him with a
knife?"
The next night she case to Darby
again.
-Watch yourself now," aha says, "for
to-night they're goin' to lave the door
of the mountain open to thry you; and
if you stir two steps outside they'll put
the comeither on you," she says.
Sure enough, when Darby took his
Â¦walk down the passage after supper, a-Â»
he did every rJgct, there the side of
the mountain lay wide open and no cue
in sight. The temptation to make one
rush was great; but he only looked out
a minute and went whustling down tht.
passage, knowing well that a hundred
hidden eyes were on him the while.
For a dozen niffhts after it was tha
same.
At another time Maureen said:
"The King himself Li going to thry
you hard the day. so beware'." She had
no sooner said the words than Darby
was called for and went up to the KinÂ£.
"Darby, my sow!." says the King, in
a gootherin* way, "have this noggin of
punch. A betther never was brewed;
it's the last we'll have for many a day.
I'm going to set you free. Darby O'GUl.
that's what I am."
"Why, King." says Darby, putting o*i
a mournful face, "how have I offended
yÂ«r*
"No offeas<Â» at all." says the Kin?,
"only we're depriving you." *
"No depravity in life!" says Darby.
"I have lashins and laving* to eat and
to drink and nothing but fun an* di
varsion all day long. Out in tha
worruld it was nothing but work and
trouble and sickness, disappointment
and care."
"But Bridget and the chiidher?" says
the King, giving him a sharp look out
of half-shut eyes.
"Oh. as for that. King," a ays Darby,
*1t"s alsier for a widow to get a hus
band or for orphans to find a father
than It Is for them to pick up a sov
ereign a daj."
The King looked mighty satisfied and
gmoked for a white without a word.
"Would you micd goin' out an evenin*
now and then, heipin' the boys to mind
the cows?" he asked at last.
Darby feared to trust himself outside
in their company. . -
"Well, ni tell ye how It is." replied
ray brave Darby. "Some of the neigh
bors might see me. and spread the re
port en me that Tm with the fairies and
that'd disgrace Bridget aad the chll
dher," he says.
The King knocked ashes from hi*
pipe. .. ;
"You're a wise man. besides being tha
holght of good company." says he, "an*
It's sorry I am you didn't take my word
for then we would have you always at
laste till the Day of Judgment, whtaâ
but that's - nayther here nor- there?
Howsomever, we'll bother you about it
no more." -.
From that day they treated him as
one of their own.
It was nearly five months afther that
Maureen ducked Darby by the coat
and led him off to a lonely spot.
"I-ve got the word." she says.
"Have you. faith! What Is ltf *ayÂ«
Darby, all of a thrlmble.
Then she whispered a word so blas

blessed himself. When Maureen saw

a fit, the holy emblem hurt her so, pour

made a second ring of holly outside the
first, so that the house sat In twj

other. The outside ring was much the

it and the first, with room for ever so
many people to stand there. It was like

" "I'll take him down into the fore

a man from the guardroom, they led
him for'd.
' Half an hour later. Jackson rejoined
me at my post.

A faint splash came from for'd.
Looking down we saw an object In
the water approaching in a phosphor
escent flow, until finally it stopped at
the foot of the gangway.
The sergeant and I hurriedly de
scended the broad gangway ladder.
At the lowest step we made out a half
saked man holding on, but apparently
too weak to pull himself out. Each of
us seized a white hand, and a second
later had the swimmer staggering up
the Eteps. We pulled him up to the
deck, where he sank upon his knees
between us, staking and sputtering,
and finally vomiting Into the scuppers.
. "For God's sake, hide me!" he
grasped; and a second fit of vomiting
overtook him.

The black mass of Jungle, Just above

flash of flre, followed by a low "br-r

some time In silence, but the cannon
ading was too distant to disturb the
almost perfect stillness that hung over
the glassy water; It seemed like being

phosphorescent flash of fish the lights

Talk to Parents
bin
Child Training
THE* raajorlt y of parents are dis
posed to take it for granted that
It Is natural for children to do
what they should. Therefore, If
tfitey do right, they are not commended.
It is taken as a matter of course. If
they do vrrong, some one is ever ready
to criticize unkindly, if not most harsh
ly. Tco often the criticism is also quite
unjust. This is all wrong. Too much
cftort ar.d time are spent in trying to
correct the wrong by harsh means. Too
little effort is made for the purpose of
lertdins into right paths by kindly en
couragement.
Your children have no knowledge of
what is right and what is wrong. All
they are. to know upon this subject
must be learned by instruction, or from
the example of others with whom they
come in contact. Since this is so, we
thouJd not be so ready to accuse chil
dren oi doing wrong purposely, or of
deliberately giving pain.
Consider the case of a boy who has
broken a valuable vase, perhaps care
lessly, and therefore liable to punish
ment. The parent calls the child to an
swer. "Ralph, did you break this vase?"
â¢Ht; answers promptly, "Yes, papa, I
did." iCany a man has faced death
at the cannon's mouth with less moi'al
courage than this boy. Is it any won
der that, in this particular case, the
loving parent commends by saying,"My
dear boy, you are brave. You ' are
noble. The value of the vase is as noth
ing compared to the prize I put upon
your truthfulness. Many a boy would
have told an untruth, knowing that no
one saw who broke it. Now I know I
can trust you to tell the 'truth at any
time and under all circumstances." Will
any one doubt that the boy's -bosom
swelled with pride? He never' forgot
the lesson. Seven years have passed,
yet, to this day, he has never given the
parent reason to believe that he is any-,
thing but perfectly honest and truthful.
In the last case mentioned/suppose
that, after the boy had acknowledged
breaking the vase, the parent had pun
ished him severely. Howunjust would
have been such treatment! There was
evidently no intention to break it.
There probably was not even more
carelessness than could justly - be ex
pected of a lively boy five years old-
Would not such treatment tend to
make any child untruthful In every
case, where he thought he would be
with the cross, surly, ill-natured child
thisv method will" 'certainly ' S Ive the
most, excellent results.. . It Is hardly
necessary "to say that a\ child â¢ should

wards I is . that I many f ailJtqT distinguish
between hiring ' and** buying children.
For example: Upon leaving home for
a- number of days, the'writeiv expressed
the ! hope that his boys would do Vas
they should. Had â¢ he wished ; to hire
them to do so, he would have promised
them some certain prize for good bÂ«?
havior. This might or might not have
produced the desired result. /When he
returned he inquired i concerning their
actions. The report being most'satis
factory, he called the boys and asked
them to go up:street with him. There
he purchased a fine penknife for each
one. In the evening he told them why
he had done so. Until that time they
had no idea of the * reason. Thus the
boys learned .that their determination
to act as they ! should was not over
looked,-even though no, promise had
been made. In such. a case it Is very
important that Improper conduct
should, certainly' result' in disappoint
ment.- . â¢?â¢â¢, "-;â¢ .â¢ 'Â¦-.:Â¦ 'Â¦ -).'Â¦' *..:" â¢â¢'/Â¦';:.".
j- â¢What has been said about hiring chll
drlri' to do as they, sbpuld must not be
taken to indicate that this should' never
be done.' . Indeed, manytimes it may be
"weli*to*agfee",i;pcrn'Â» price for a certain
amount of" work. This" " will ; ~ act as a
'stimulant and % all : .through : life they
will fln4 that only as the result of work
done can they expect to: pay. It may
even be deemed a proper thing for par
ents to sometimes buy 'children to do as
likely to escape? Surely, no" onejwill
doubt that the influence of the first
mentioned : method, upon the develop
ing character, would be infinitely better
than if the second plan had been used.
The great trouble Is that the almost
universal tendency is to pass, without
notice, the many times the child tells
the truth and does . right, and to deal
most harshly â¢ with him the time he
yields to the natural temptation. The
child may treat a younger brother or
Bister with kindness twenty times and
receive no word of commendation. He
is sure to, receive, a scolding, if not
wors"e, if the twenty-first time he for
get himself : and acts naturally, by rea
son of the imposition of the younger
child. Is not this all wrong? ,
V- Let all be watchful and praise what
Is Tight,? rather .than continually Tflnd
fault with/what is wrong. ; This is of
vast Importance in training \o- proper
conduct. â¢ However, parents should
guard against indiscriminate * commen
dation." : v When f used without good rea
son,the "tendency is to make the child
vain and to do more barm than good.'
Praise what Is really praiseworthy. Do
not praise that which requires no
of the will or moral rectitude. Even

they wished. Though certainly wrong
in principle, yet it is better both for the
parent and the child than a system of
management by harsh threats and bru
tal punishments.
\ Some yet assert that there Is no prac
tical 'difference > in simply rewarding a
child for what he has done and paying
him a promised amount However, is
there not considerable difference? In
the first case the. doing of the right
thing is associated with .pleasant re
sults which were not anticipated. Thus
doing* right is made more attract!ve
in the other case the child will feel
that he has performed services for a
fixed reward. If he does not wish the
reward he is apt to feel he need not do
as. directed. If he does as he is told he
is apt to feel that the reward belongs
to him, and there is therefore no sense
of obligation to do right because It is
right. - :l;.-'C
_ Every parent who has more than one
child should not fall to understand that
no, two children are alike. In physical,
mental and moral characteristics they
differ widely. The same treatment will
not answer for any two. The principles
of management may be the same, but
the application of the principles must
be modified by the individual peculiari
ties of the child. VjÂ«^
Since children do differ so widely why
should parents strive to treat all alike?
Such treatment will crush the Individu
ality out of any child. This individual
ity parents should strive to make a
guide to ' the child's education I and
training. Too often It la considered aa
something which the parent should
strive to overcome entirely: . r
The great effort which Is made in
school and at home seems to be to make
children more uniform. Yet, who will
give any good reason why a person
should labor to produce , uniformity of
taste of character, of ability or' of aspi
rations? Is not individuality of far
more importance than uniformity? Is
It not the divinity of, the child?. Should
it not be sought for and discovered,
that it may be carefully studied, and,
when along right lines, lovingly guard
ed? Does not biography teach us ihat
only those have become distinguished
who have developed a love for. work
along particular lines? Is'-*t not^tlme
that parents, limited in power arid; by
conditions, 1 cease striving to overcome
the many differences predetermined by
the Almighty?

) SHALL paint one egg for every
country upon which the Easter sun
j?h:::es," said the Easter egg girl
iookir.g ahead toward Easter.
â¢Those eggs that need long prep
aration and a great deal of work shall
be b!o\vr.-out eggs. I shall make^ a hole
in one end and a hole in the other end
â sr.d blow!
"The result will be a hollowy shell,
oiquisitely fine and beautifully trans
parent. This I shall take and 'size,'
and when 1 have done that I shall paint
the shell.
"Painting a shell without sizing it Is
unsatisfactory, from an artistic stand
point. Your . ..ints sink in as though
yuu were painting upon new %vood or
upen freshly made crockery, and the
results :-â¢Â» anything but good. You
luse your effects before you have got It.
"But if you will take your eggshell
cud prepare it. then you stand a good
chance of getting something nice.
"Why is it necessary to blow out the
egs? "Why, from esthetic reasons.
When the first hen decided to lay eggs
instead of cobblestones she unfortu
nately began too soon. She started in
e^s laying before she had fully com
pleted her shell. She laid an article
which, while very palatable when fresh,
is far from good eating when it Is old.
The shell of an egg is too porous for
.its own good.
"Nc-,v if the hen had had time to
thoroughly prepare herself for her life
long task of laying eggs she would have
undoubtedly manufactured an article
â¢that would keep indefinitely. As it Is
the egg is perishable, and if the shell
be a thins which Is to be preserved you
must take out the contents.
"Eggs can be boiled very hard before
they are painted; and, then, if placed
in a cold spot, they will keep until
Kaster. But even a boiled egg has no
permanent lease of life. The shell of
an egg is such a poroua article that the
hard boiled ess spoils and goes very
wrung almost as quickly as a raw egg.

"There are artistic and industrious
girls who take an egg and paint it
beautifully, decorating it 'in the most
charming manner. They will paint tiny
sky blue Cupids upon it, tossing n.ses
from one to another. Again they vvilj
decorate the egg with a chain cf !bw
ers, with small nymphs holding up the
chain as daintily as possible.
"When they have completed these
eggs, which are painted in .1 hard
boiled state, they take them and pack
them in oats, with the small end down.
A large stone jar is the best thing to

the eggs can be brought tut for' the; ap

these are to be eaten cold for luncheon,

"Painting an egg for every country

nothing to painting a typical beauty for
each land. For the French girl there
must be an ideal head full of chic and
suggestion. The German girl is a blonde
haired beauty, tranquil, a Gretchen
with fair braids falling down her back.
Her eyes are blue, her hair yellow and
her clieeks exactly like the blUEh side

Indeed. To make this shirring very ef
fective a dee:> hem is somethnes made
in the top and a shirr string is run
through. Another shirring is placed
three inches below the top one, and
still another. In this manner a deep
heading is formed, while the flounce is
very full below it. >
/ The plainer suits, the linens.- the can
vases and the other substantial goods,
are made with a many gored skirt,
plain and finished with a deep hem. The
skirt is well shaped.. and there is the
inevitable flare around the foot, with
out which no skirt is complete.
Other skirts are trimmed with bias
bands of the material, and still others
are trimmed with stitched strappings
of the goods, while others are trimmed
with latticed bands. There are hand
some linen skirts that are decorated
with stitched panels, with yokes out
lined with strappings and with a. deep
flounce-like piece, with a stitched. band
at the top.
Quite a large percentage of the Mnen
suits show inlets of heavy lace, with
delicate wash embroidery outlining the
lace. The number of linen gowns
trimmed with lace Is constantly on the
increase, and the trim and neat linen
gown which was so necessary a feature
of the wardrobe threatens to disappear
utterly.
Yet there are those who like the per
fectly plain tailored linens and the se
vere ginghams, and for those who enjoy
wearing these summer suits there are a
number of little English styles which
will catch the eye.
The Three-Quarter Linen Coat.
A very neat tailored suit of Scotch
gingham was made in two colors, and
there are many linen suits made of two
shades of linen. The pipings, the strap
pings and the small trimmings of the
rait are of a shade of linen to contrast j
with the main part.
The linen coat has come In with the^
summer wardrobe. This coat Is cut
straight and is trimmed with lace. It
is made with wide sleeves and there is
some fullness across the back. A coat
of linen is washable and should be
trimmed with linen lace. But aside
from the material there is nothing or
dinary about the coat, for it is cut on
the smartest of summer models.
A very knowing little coat of blue
linen is cut long, almost to the knees.
It has . the exaggerated sleeves of an
opera coat and the sleeves are trimmed
with very wide lace. The collar is a
square sailor collar, also trimmed with
lace, and there is abundant lace upon
the front of the coat
The fashion of making up a three
quarter or a half length coat of ma
terial to match the gown Is a growing
one, and more than half of the summer
suits will be fitted out in this way. The
fashion is one that is simple to make,
for it requires very little fitting and the
only cost is the price of the material,
which, in the case of linen or canvas
or any of the heavy materials. Is not
great.
The requirement of a three-quarter
coat is that It shall fit across the
shoulders, shall have very wide sleeves
and that the sleeve's shall be finished
in some handsome manner, perhaps
with a wide puff caught into a narrow
cuff, below which falls a very wide cur
tain of lace.
Another way to finish a coat sleeve
Is with what is called a cornucopia,
which is bordered with lace and Is
lined with lace frills. These can be
built of very coarse lace or of lace of
very tough weave, so that they are
washable.
> The Tvro-Pirce Shirt Waist Suits.
A direct outcome of the fancy for tha
three-quarter Unea coat la tie twoÂ»
There" la a very stiff lace, which; is
stiffened by special process before, It Is
made into Eton jackets. These llttls
jackets, which look as though they
were made of horsehair, are cut very;
short between the shoulders. There ax*
arm holes and the front of the jacket Is
left ooen. The whole thing could bo
rolled and slipped into a napkin riny-
Silk flowers are sometimes inset.. This
jacket trims up an old silk waisÂ£ or s>
shabby lawn waist most admirably.
The vast majority of summer skirts
are full skirts. They are made with,
shirred vokea and with shirred hips.
These shlrrings can be so arranged as
to trim the skirt, for if full and hand
somely treated they form In themselves
a trimming for the skirt. Three shirâ

One of the distinguishing' features? of
this new GibsonJan silk shoulderette Is
its stiffness. The silk does not Us

slinky fashion, but sets out very smart
ly. To make it still stiffer it is em
broidered with a very heavy embroid
ery and trimmed with a lace tMt Is
wiry In texture. Â¦ Â¦>-/:
One of the prettiest of slBr collars is
cut with the Gibson shoulders. It Is
very wide upon the shoulders and ex
tends out over the arm hale, stand
ing out almost like an epaulette. TMa
style of collar, the Gibson, collar. Is cut
round and Is as deep tn the back as
In front. It is made of silk and sur
rounded bv stitchery and embroidery*.
Lace Is also Inset. The edgo of this
collar is cut in scroll shape and fin
ished with a stiff lace, so stiff, aa to be
almost . wiry.
The wide silk collar?, adjustable antZ
made of silk and lace, will be worn
with the summer suits and some of
them are exceedingly decorative. They
are made after different patterns and
all of them impart quite a dxtaay air- to
any gown. \ â¢
Very Important In thÂ« list ot summer
fashions are the linen stoles and the
linen collars, for these are worn, over
the shirt waists and they take the
place of the .very fancy shirt waist to
a great extent. WUi? linen collars, aa
deep as the shoulders, and collarettes
that are rounding and made like capes
are worn. These are cut upon the
most approved models and are charm
ing with summer suits.
The stoles are also handsome and
dressy and. to make a stole of the dress
material la very little work or extra
expense. The prettiest of these stoles
are in the shape of round collars, with,
long ends attached in front, and are
to be thrown around the neck and
caught under the chin, with a set of.
cords and tassels.
The blouse part la slipped on! like a
coat and for summering Is carried
over tha arm.
â¢ And, in the Ifst of strainer suits, ont
must not forget the Eton shirt waist
suit, which consists -of a skirt and an
Eton jacket. The Eton Is built of Unea
or canvas or heavy cotton stuff and Is
slipped on over the shirt waist, which
is of any pretty material and color,
usually white, for womankind runs to
white this year.
The IJnen Stoles and Collars.
Then, fn the list of summer cults,
there, must not be forgotten the golf
shirt waist suit for amateurs. This Is
made with a w^etl^shaped Instep skirt,
usuany^GjEVofd' of "trimming at all, un-
Tess one except a very slender piping.
The coat is short and straight, a little
English coat, trimmed with stitched
bands. There are conspicuous pÂ«axl
buttons upon It and It buttons to the
throat.
And still another variety of shirt
waist suit la the Russian blouse suit,
which is a two piece suit and. lika
many others, requires a shirt waist la
addition. The Russian blouse shirt
wafst suit Is made with an instep skirl,
with a Russian blouse waLsf which Is
buttoned down the front and can bÂ«
taken off. and with a shirt waist.
The skirt is plain, but the coat Is very
elaborately trimmed. "
And there are automobile shirt waist
suits. These consist of a linen skirt,
beautifully shaped and of walking
length. The skirt is trimmed with
strapped and stitched bands. "With this
skirt there Is an automobile coat of tha
same material, usually of linen, with
strappings and with wide sleeves. Tha
sleeves and collar are more elaborately
trimmed than Is customary with auto
mobile coats, for they are bordered
with wide lace and are trimmed with
neat, compact trimmings, such as hard
French knots, buttons, wheel stitch, em
broidery and braid.
The down-hanging part of the sleeve
is by no means soft and 'slinky, but is
Interlined and is stiffened and is some
times padded to make it set dul well.
: There is. a new way to "make .the
. sleeve kee;> ; its stiffness below the el
.bow, and this is" by the wearing of an
undernraist. The low necked and long
sleeved underwaists are lovely. They
are made very much on the shirt waist
pattern, with blouse front and snug
back. Then there are .the sleeves of
? underwaists, which are tight above the
- elbow, but, very, full below, with a puff
â¢" at the wrist. This acts not only as a
lining, but as a stiffening for the
gown.
The Lattice Waist.
.;A. fashion that Will ' be much seen
this summer is the lattice style. Rib
bon and silk are latticed, and also rib
bon and lace. A pretty blouse is made
of lace. And upon this lace there is
a lattice of ribbon about three inches
square. At each intersection there
hangs a crocheted ball. The sleeves
, and the skirt are trimmed with the
hanging balls.

exercise used in dancinj. which lays
a firm foundation for good and lasting
health. Among a rude and dissolute
people dancing may perhaps degener

are similarly liable to abuse and we
have no more right to condemn danc
ing on account of its abuses than any
of our other recreations.
DANCING, properly taught and
practiced, is the best safeguard
against the evils of overmen tal

Such charity as they receive from
their own people would not make life
endurable to any Western man " or
woman. A strip of cotton cloth, a
handful of rice, cooked or uncooked,
with broken bits of food begged from
door to door, and sometimes requiring
a half day to secure sufficient fpr a

organization of the force will take
time to complete, but there is no rea
son to doubt that it will proceed on
these broad lines. The natural base
of this fleet Is the Philippines. Men
tion has been made elsewhere of a
naval depot at Subig Bay, and It may
be added as a matter of the first Im
portance that the maintenance of our
force In the Philippines and Its readi
ness for use are largely dependent upon
a naval base and dockyard at this
point The battleships and cruiser di
vision of this fleet made at the very
end of 1903 a. successful and memorable
cruise to Honolulu, and after a short
rest returned to their oVn cruising
grounds. This cruise tested the sea
keeping qualities of the units In an un
usual degree, and It is gratifying to
know that both battleships and cruis
ers â even the low freeboarded Oregon
â came out of the trial unscathed.
Six cruisers of an Improvised Olym
pia type and four cruisers of the scout
type are needed on this station. Of
these two are available and two must
be provided. The commander in chief
of the fleet recommends that two ves
sels, small gunboats or large launches,
be built and assigned for service in
Chinese rivers for the protection of our
Interests in such places as our pres
ent gunboats cannot reach, owing to
their draught. Other nations have
vessels of this description In Asiatio
waters, and as American interests in
China are expanding it will be wise tÂ»
provide the small and Inexpensive
types suggested.
In addition to the vessels regularly
assigned to the various stations other
craft have been employed In Important
duties. The first destroyer flotilla ha*
undertaken a long voyage to the Phil
ippines, by way of the Canaries, Gib
raltar, Mediterranean, Sues, Red Sea
and so onward across the Indian
Ocean. A curious and inexplicable ef
fort was made to Interfere with this
cruise, but wiser counsels have pre
vailed,, and our officers will therefore
enjoy a new experience and have an
opportunity of comparing their craft
with foreign- destroyers that have ac
complished equally long and sever*
journeys. It must be said In con
clusion that most of this material has
been taken from the official report of
the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation,
and that its text has been largely
used. No attempt has been made to

sea service and two vessels for river
work, allowing^one of each type to be
absent for repairs. Culebra Island has
hitherto been Its headquarters, : but
Guantanamo ' has finally been chosen
as its primary base and as a perma
nent^ dockyard. With this' position well
defended by fortifications, it is unlike
ly that strong works will be needed at
Culebra.
The coast squadron was organized
on May 19, 1903, and is composed uf
the battleship Texas, the monitors Ar
kansas, Nevada and Florida and a flo
tilla of five deatrc-yers. This force is
to constitute one of the principal ele
ments In the general strategic plan and
will be used 'primarily for the defense
of our coast and secondarily as a re
serve to strengthen our principal fleet
in the West Indies. It is Intended that
this squadron shall be composed of
powerful ships, like the three new
monitors, which, though formidable in
battle, are not designed for distant
cruising or continuous foreign duty.
It Is to be regularly based upon Key
West and its vicinity, as this is a con
venient central position with reference
to the Atlantic coast, the Gulf of Mex
ico and the West ' Indies. The ships
of this squadron find, active employ
ment during the summer months as
a training division for the Naval Acad
emy. The increased number of mid
shipmen makes it necessary to have
a large practice squadron, and the use
of an active cruising force for this
purpose has already proved beneficial.
The midshipmen become familiar with
the. routine and customs of a regular
squadron, and tills, it Is hoped, will
make them more quickly available upon
graduation for entering upon the ardu
ous duties of their profession. This is
most desirable, because* the present
lack of commissioned officers enables
midshipmen to assume at once posi
tions of considerable responsibility. â¢ ;
The training squadron, consisting of
certain vessels that cruise actively,
was organized in July. 1902. It Is in
dependent of the North Atlantic fleet
and has been formed not for maneu
vering and tactical exercises, but for
convenience of administration. Under
the old system ships were left largely
to their individual devices, uniformity
of method being secured. in some de
gree by general regulations and regu
lar inspections.
This system had sortie success when
the number of men in the navy was
insignificant; but with several thou

Pacific Waters.
The Pacific station requires a cruiser
squadron, and this should consist of
two divisions, each having four ves- .
sels. Hitherto it has not been found
practicable to employ more than four
ships actively cruising in these waters.
The extent of this station and our in
terests in the Pacific make it imprac
ticable to carry on the work properly
with less than the two divisions indi
cated. It is not intended that these
shall interchange with other squadrons
as frequently as in the Atlantic, but it
is deemed advisable that one division
of four cruisers , should from time to
time visit the west coast of South
America, and when practicable inter
change with the South Atlantic squad
ron at the Straits of Magellan. It Is
also probable that a division of this
squadron will occasionally interchange
with the cruiser division of the Asiatic
fleet, meeting for that purpose at a
convenient rendezvous off Honolulu or
among the Aleutian Islands. Prepared
ness for war demands that this habit
of mobility should become nearly auto
matic. Some objections have been
raised that squadrons will not remain
long enough on any one station, and
therefore fail to become familiarly ac
quainted with it. This defect must,
however, be borne with for the greater
good that results from acquiring "the
habit of mobility."
The vessels assembled in Asiatic
waters have been for nearly six years
actively employed in very trying du
ties. Owing to patent reasons the
force has grown to such a size that
it had to be organized in 1902 into a
fleet with three divisions, the general
situation apparently demanding a bat
tleship squadron, a cruiser squadron
and a squadron of small vessels. This
III.
Foreign Divisions.
The South Atlantic squadron con
sists? of a few ships utterly unlike in
design and unequal in possibilities.
Our interests in these waters are al
ways important and the little group
stationed there should be increased.
The least number of cruisers desirable
is six. four of a scout cruiser type and
two improved Olympias. Of the cruis
ers now In service and building three
could be spared for the station, thus
leaving only three to be provided. In
the development of the fleet this force
would be assigned to the South At
lantic^ station during peace for pur
poses of tactical drills and 'incidentally
to watch American interests in that
â¢region. In case of war it could be
united with other squadrons in the
West Indies, thus forming a fleet of
considerable strength.
' The latest official ' announcement is
that th*e various squadrons are at set
periods to interchange duties, and it is
reported that the European and South
Atlantic scuadrons are to exchange
stations at the completion of the
winter maneuvers in the Carribean.
This will be better news to the South
Atlantic officers and men than to the
Mediterranean cruisers. It must be
confessed that of late the letter's em
ployment has not been all skittles and
beer, owing to the difficulties at Bey
rout. '
The European squadron consists of
a small division, its principal strength
being centered In the flagship. . '
The official plan contemplates the as
signment to this important station of
The South Atlantic station begins at
the southern limits of the European
and embraces all the Atlantic coasts
of Africa and South America and ex
tends to the seventieth degree of east
longitude, north to the equator â that
is, beyond and around the Cape of
Good Hope.
The Asiatic station takes in the east
coast of Africa (excluding the waters
of the South Atlantic), the Indian
Ocean, China Seas and the Pacific
Ocean east of 170 degrees west. In
this area are situated the navy yards
at CavJte, Manila, the station at Subig
Bay and the storehouse and hospital
in Yokohama, Japan. Roughly speak
ing, its waters Include nearly one-half
of the naval cruising area, thus shar
ing with the Pacific in a close equal
ity about twelve-sixteenths of the
zones subjected to naval protection.
Of the remainder South America has
about two-sixteenths and the North
Atlantic and European about one-six
teenth each. Rejecting the water
spaces of the world not of necessity

sels, more than one hundred millions
of square miles demand the protection

to 170 degrees west longtitude and
south to some point not specially desig
nated in consequence of the^ extension
of the Asiatic station, after the war
with Spain. Within its limits are lo
cated the navy yards at Bremerton,
Wash., and Mare Island, Cal., and the
coal depots at Pichilinque, in Lower
California, at Tutuila, Samoa, and at
Hawaii, together with a naval station
on the island of that name.
The European station embraces the
coasts of Europe, the Mediterranean
on both shores and the African coast
as far south as St. Paul de Loando;
thence diagonally westward to the
junction of the equator and the forty
fifth degree of west longitude, this
meridian separating it from the North
Atlantic. Formerly there was a store
house within 1 these limits, and a soft
berth it afforded, but It has been aban
doned.
The battleship squadron thus forms
a nucleus around which may be gath
ered the other units to assist as occa
sion demands in special duties or in
the maneuvers and" tactical -exercises
which now form a part of our regular
winter and summer programme.
The Caribbean squadron, created .in
October, 1902, is intended to provide
a force in Caribbean waters which can
proceed quickly to . points demanding
protection for American interests.
Prompt action is more thoroughly pro
vided for, it is believed, by the pres
ence of a flag officer, who may of his
own Initiative -investigate difficulties
and enter into consultation with the
authorities of the somewhat difficult
countries that border on the Caribbean.
The number of cruisers needed in this
squadron is set down as eight, five of
which should be Improved Olympias,
and three be vessels of light draught
specially constructed for river service,
but capable of keeping the sea. This
w>.uld provide at all times a division
or squadron of four cruisers" for. active

suggestions upon the actual force that
we should assemble in the various seas
of the world. Our actual squadrons
and what they should be, according
to his judgment, are set down in the
chart accompanying the article. Be
ginning with the North Atlantic sta
tion, he points out that this force
was in 1903 expanded into a fleet con
sisting of the battleship squadron un
der a rear admiral, commander in
chief: of the Caribbean squadron un

squadron, also under a rear admiral.
The flag officers commanding these
two latter mentioned - squadrons are
subject to^ the orders of the com
mander in chief of the fleet.

Cruising Stations.
THE United Slates assigns its
cruising force to five geographi
cal divisions, and It is interest-

boundaries have varied but little in
many years. It is true fr&at the desig
nations have from time to time been
modified, and some old names, familiar
once as household words, have disap

most conservative of all executive
bodies, has not ventured.

. of police, neutrality, protection, explor

afloat are assembled on the following

â¢ fifth, the Asiatic.
The limits of the North Atlantic ex
tend from the east coast of North
America to the forty-fifth degree of

The friends and workers organized by
Swam I Vivekananda there to meet
these needs often deny themselves
necessary food or comforts essential to
health.
Such amounts as are given to them
for various kinds of charity cannot be
dispensed otherwise, and they have no
fund to call upon for hospitality. When
guests present themselves,* therefore,
deprivation follows for those who
should keep well for .the sake of their
work on behalf of others.
The order has generously spared very
able men to this country. Any- poor
person wishing to assist the poor In
India through this order can best do
so by earning the means ' here. This
they cannot do In India.*
It should be remembered .. that Vive
kananda felt above all things the need'
of modern education and scientific
tributed the excesses of later years.

that the college students were respon

demoralization of the time honored
waltz on account of the eagerness of
different colleges to institute a pecu

There is the Harvard glide, the Yale

other departures from the true

â¢ With, almost superhuman energy and
.:?â¢â¢ iipenoe the Japanese have in
thiity-eijjht years evolved into civilized
efficiency a navy which commenced
with one gunboat, armed with an old
Miiooth-bore 2C-pounder. and three Iron
su srr.ers fitted wl *i masts and spars.
How this has been accomplished is
frilly interesting. In 1S66, at the re
quest of the Japanese G- vernment, six
instructors and six officers, under the
ckarce ' admiralâ then commander-
Sir Richard Traoeyâ left England to
instruct the Japanese In nautical mat
ters. One of this little band still lives
oa the Sussex tvast, in a little seaside
village.
â¢ He says: "I always expected the
"Japanese would excel in naval strat
*Ky, indeed. 1 would rather instruct
fifteen Japanese than three English.
They are wonderfully keen, studious,
â¢ar.d have a most wonderful gift of ac
quiring knowledge."
â¢ The instructors, u*>on their arrival.
were astounded to find the Japanese
absolutely devoid of knowledge of
things nautical. Saveral self-called
"r.aval authorities had, despite this fact.
conferred upon themselves the title of
adrr.lral, though they had never been
to eea.
â¢ A collegeâ the -'Skeegee College"â
fcr officers and cadets, was founded at
Ttdo, and between thirty and forty
cadets, and thirty seniors, ranging from
25. to 45 years of age, were enrolled.
The Japanese language afforded no
words of command, so it was arranged
to adopt British terms. The classes
Â¦worked five to six hours dally In the
rr.astery of English, and so great an
enthusiasm prevailed that the embryo
efficers begged for time out of hours in
Â¦which to fit themselves for the discus
sion of English subjects outside the
co-lege curriculum.
At the time the Japanese were much
averse tc the visits on their shores of
.foreigners: therefore to insure the
'safety of the instructors the "Skeegee
College** organized in secret a guard
Â¦of honor for them, but it was not until
.they left, some time later, that they
.learned that whenever they went out
â¢each individual was closely followed by

iVtion.In the Russian army, tests were- made
a few years ago to ascertain the value
of marching ' songs, and the results so
confirmed ; Lord Wolseley's dictum that
the regulations .now decree that- regi
ments '; on march , and In , advancing â¢ to
charge shall sing national songs. In
the Austrian maneuvers ; of -1900 ; Gen
eral Kryanowsky made a 'Curious ex
periment as to the use of ; songs as a
means ) of :â¢ locating I the ; position of the
battalions of an army, corps. He di
rected each division to learn a different
.war,' or, folk, song, and ' to sing It' when
attacked I or going Â¦ into â¢ action. Thus
from the music, the headquarters-staff
was able to discover at a distance what
battalions were, under fire and attacked
by^ the "enemy. " " ' ; y
composition ever promulgated," de
clared Carlyle. But it Is notable that
all truly national songs have had such
lucky births; they have been written,
like the "Marseillaise," by amateurs in
fits 'of spontaneity. An otherwise un
known : German schoolmaster, named
Wilhclm, S wrote and * composed "Die
Wacht am Rheln." This, not the
"Hymn to the Kaiser," was the "sol
diers' song" during the war against
France.
.Italy received- its Garibaldian Hymn
in the same spontaneous way. Its au
thorship is entirety unknown;: probably
it was written by some patriot In Gari
baldi's army with the simple object
of giving his comrades a tuneful and
lively, song to cheer the march. But it
won the ear and touched. the heart of
Italy, Tand is more truly national than
the anthem since officially composed
and adopted by the - Government.
Again, in the ' American Civil War, the
song of the troops was not the official
ly national "Hail, Columbia," but the
much ' more simple and thrilling
John Brown's body lies raolderlnr In Un gnur*.

In the Japanese army it Is the cus

The practice was remarked " during the
operations of the allied powers against
Peking. Their favorite song is the
"Kimi iGayo," or national anthem,
.which -has .been Englished as follows:

IN adopting an official marching
song for the British army, the War
Office has the support of modern
Â¦- military experts and immemorial
custom. . Music has always played a
great part in fighting, and I^ord Wolse
ley declares that "troops that sing as
they march will not only " reach their
destination more quickly and in better
fighting condition- than those who
.march in silence, but, inspired by -the
music and words of national songs,
will feel that self-confidence , which Is
the mother of victory-" But whether
Tommy Atkins will take kindly to the
song composed for him may be doubt
ed. Such things do not come about by
order and decree. The British soldier
Is musical only in a limited degree. _
Nor are the songs sung martial or
national. There Is no record that "God
Save the King" or even the' more stir
ring "Rule Britannia" has ever been
sung by our' troops as a battle song.
At Waterloo and in the Crimea there
are stories of regiments breaking forth
with the rousing, "British, Grenadiers."
But Tommy's real favorites ! are senti
mental ditties of the order of "The Girl
I Left Behind Me." Thaf has. been
sunjj more often by British soldiers
as their hymn before action than any
other song. The tune was- formerly
known as "Brighton Camp," and, dat
ing from 1640 ,in Ireland, came to Eng
land about a century ago. In the Boer
war" Tommy solaced himself; with
music-hall songs, and that a more
seemly composition, produced under

TOKIO. Japan, Feb. 18.
y""^r OING to war has various phases,
f / come of them amusing as well
WT as strenuous, and not at all dan-
V^" gerous. except to tempers.
Official War Time Marching Song's
movements might have been justly
construed by Russia as unfriendly acts,
and have precipitated what both side*
then professed to be. hoping by diplo-
matic means to avoid.
But the declaration of war removed
that reason. Up to the time the cor-
respondents here had been unable to^
obtain any^hins definite from any of-
ficial source as to what their move-
ments would be, or when they would
be allowed to move at all. It finally
was said that there were no regula-
tions to govern the correspondents,
That led to the information that In
due time such regulations - would' be
issued. Meantime" the correspondents
possessed their souls in' what peace
they could, and worried about kit. In-
cldentally more steamers arrived
bringing more correspondents,*'and
those who had come early in D'rder^to.,
avoid the rush saw themsel\-fs.oyer^i
taken by increasing numbers;ofUb"eir>
fellows, and all hope of "early bird"
advantage vanished. ' Â¦* ,',r:; v v ,
All this and still no regulations^ Thejk
came, however, In the course t of a.long^t
time. There are fourteen sectloris./be-i,
ginning with the provision that*appli-]t
cation to go to the field must be-made -
to the War Department and be accom-.
panied by a sketch of the applicant's
life and a document of personal guar
antee, signed by. the proprietor of the
newspaper for which the applicant
works. Foreign correspondents need
not sketch their lives and the guarantee
sj. dispensed with.
TÂ£ Section 2 provides that the applicant
-must have done newspaper work for
oiielyear at least. No greenhorns are
toibe, permitted to spend their vaca
ionaf with the Japanese army,
-5 The^third section provides that for
elgners^ may take- an interpreter, for
"whom they must give a personal guar
antee. By section 4 they are permitted
The remaining sections promise that
the army will do Its best to facilitate
the correspondents, and in case of ne-f
cesslty provide food and transportation.
They also declare correspondents, their
Interpreters and servants subject to
court-martial for violation of the crim
inal law, the military criminal law or
thÂ© law for thÂ© preservation of mili
tary secrets. -
There was nothing in these regula
tions to cause dismay, and, in fact,
most of them had. been foreseen. The
limitation to one servant made it look
as if a man would have to either do his
own cooking or his own camp work,
"for It was unlikely that he could find
a man who could or would do both for
â¢ him. ;- . \
But that was not an Insurmountable
hardship, and the promise to provide
transportation, by vessel if necessary,
seemed to indicate a willingness to let
a man go to the field with a suitable
outfit so that he could make himself
comfortable. Thereupon those who had
not got tents went out and ordered
them, and fur coats and robes and
sleeping bags Increased correspondingly
in number* v
; For a day or two after these regula
tions appeared in the Official Gazette
there was lively .work among the news
paper men making what they then
thought would be final preparations.
The long expected and eagerly desired
passes. would surely be issued now in
a , day or~ so. They were certain of It
' when notices were posted at the hotel
by ; the ; military attache ' of the British
legation, 'saying that the War Office
desired to have all the applications pre
sented as soon as possible. But after
a day or two of anxious expectancy the
old air of uncertainty came back, in
decision and lndeflnlteness ' lurked in
Section 8 says: "Correspondents
shall always wear foreign clothes, and
to their left arm shall be attached a
white band, about two "inches wide, on
which the name of the newspaper rep
resented shall be printed In Japanese
In red."
Sections 9 and 10 provide that the
correspondents shall always carry their
permits and shall show them to any
Japanese officer who desires tÂ» see
them. They must observe any rules
made by the commanding officers of
their respective columns and may be
set down for failure to do so.
* Section 11 provides for a field cen
sorate as follows: "The war corre
spondent will not be permitted to dis
patch his communications Â¦ (whether
they be correspondence for publication
or private letters or telegrams) until
after their examination by thÂ» officer
appointed by the commanding officer.
No communication containing cipher
or symbols will be permitted to be dis
patched."
to take also one servant, guaranteed
like the interpreter.
Then comes the prize, section 5: "ThÂ«
authorities, when they consider it
necessary, may cause the selection of
one person to act as Joint correspond
ent for several newspapers."
Sections 6 and 7 provide that passes
shall be given to those correspondents
who are permitted to go to the front,
and that they shall be attached to
headquarters of the columns they ao
company. -I'","'
.QOMETHING of the un
*Â®\ precedented difficulties
Cr and iron-clad regula
tions that the wily, taciturn
Japanese military authori
ties are heaping upon the
great army of war corre
spondents now fuming im
putently in Tokio is told in
the following letter just re
ceived from 0. K. Davis, the
Xew York Herald and San
Francisco CalFs correspond
ent. Never before were such
stringent conditions im
posed. .Â«l|
every corner and the business of the
hour was the old petty discussion of
minor details of kit. or hot argument"^
as to the value of this or that style of
an agreed on necessity.
The siege of the War Offle* tor la
formation was regularly laid. Every
day sorties were made, sometimes by
detached parties, sometimes almost ea
masse. One by one little fragments ei
seeming Information were picked up
and the utmost was made of tvum^, The
wonderful conspiracy of sllenee wtt2Â»
which the Japanese had cloaked thetr
earlier preparations for war was con
tinued as far as what should be don*
with war correspondents was con
cerned.
Then came the crusher. It was cfl>
dally Intimated to several men ea Um
same day that they would be expects^
to take with them Into the flsl4_only
what luggage one servant could carry.

even a fur coat, no oook store, so type

kit! You might as well tlthtr not try
to go or make up your mind to Uve^
'in your saddle pockets and draw ra
tions from the army, which Is likely tÂ»
mean untold quantities of rice and
| plenty of hot water.
But what does It matter? To-day
comes the news that the Japansss havt
already got 20,000 men in Seoul, and the
land/movements we have been waiting
so long to see have begun without us.
The general staff calmly announce*
that when "the two armies are In con
tact" the correspondents will bt per
mitted .to go to the front. There is no
sign of the Issuance of a pass, and ths
main business of the newspaper men
has reverted to the selection of camp
beds and the making of leather writing
portfolios.
We understand then is a war on be
tween Japan and Russia. The only ln
Â¦ dlcatloh of the fact there Is In Toklo
is the presence of a large staff of high
ly certificated war correspondents, all
busily Inactive, occupied only In gen
eral discussion of details of camp gear
and In replying to a multitude of invi
tations to luncheons, parties, dinners
I and evenings at bridge. fflpg
Oh, for ten minutes of the man front
Salamanca!
There, is also what is known as the
"urgent" rate. If a man is in a great
hurry to get through an important
message he may pay the urgent rate
and have it take precedence of all other
messages on the wires except urgents
filed before his or Government business.
The newspaper men out here have been
in the habit of taking advantage of
these three rates as circumstances war
ranted in order to catch editions of
their papers. The time occupied in
transmission by a message at press
rates Is known to them, as is that of a
message at "full rate," the ordinary
commercial price and at urgent rates.
By taking Into account the difference
of time between here and New Tork a
man may gauge his chance of catching 1
any edition of his paper, and If the Im
portance of his news warrants he will
send It at full rate^or urgent.
But under the Japanese regulation
there is only one rate for a press mes
sage, and that Is the press rate. Mes
sages to newspapers will not be,ac
cepted, even .if prepaid, at full rate or
urgent. Accordingly, If a newspaper
man wishes to send such a message to
his office he must'direct it to "a private
address and prepay it.
No amount' of argument has been
able to effect a reconsideration of this
decision.* The Japanese Government Is
unable . to comprehend the fact , that a
telegram for publication may be'suffi
ciently valuable to warrant a news
paper in paying three times the cpm
merclal rate for It.
Something of this spirit of regulation
has been met by the newspaper men in
their efforts to get to the front with
the Japanese troops. Before the actual
outbreak of hostilities special regula
tions were issued forbidding any men
tion of the , movements of troops or
ships. Simultaneously a secret cen
sorship was established over telegrams,
and all reference to such movements
were cut" out.
For some time nothing was said
about such action to the men' who had
filed the messages, but recently, and
after considerable , criticism, : the sys
tem was adopted of notifying the
senders of messages that had been ex
cised o f the words that had : been - cut
out These notices come in bunches
sufficiently old to prevent any attempt
to get out the thing that has been
excised In a different way.
All that -care - was â¢ undoubtedly . jus
tified. The Japanese could not afford
to have their enemy obtain any Ink
ling of what they were .doing In the
way of preparation for war, and at the
i earlier stages of the preparations their
One of the most surprising changes
effected by this war has been an ar
rangement by which telegrams may be
sent to newspapers and paid fc-r by
the receiver. This was effected only on
the guarantee by the cable â¢ company
which receives the -messages from the
Japanese Government wires that it
would be responsible for the charges.
But here comes in the wonderful reg
ulation. A press telegram is a message
intended for publication, and the rule
is that It must be published in the next
issue of the paper after it is "received
and a copy of the paper y fient to the
delivering telegraph office. For such
messages a less rate is charged than for
ordinary commercial messages. â¢ '.w: â¢Â¦..

than to Increase the Government's an

returns on the investment would be

source of. our national wealth, and to
increase the products of the soil and

The improvements made In dairying,
feeding and breeding live stock grasses
and grains and the saving to .farmers
through proper use of commercial fer
tilizers, suppressing destructive Injects
and cereal diseases, etc., have been of
untold value to the agricultural inter
ests of the country. s
The money expended by the Govern

of experiment stations partakes more'
of the nature of a profitable investment
than of an appropriation. The money
expended has brought wonderful cash

This is only one instance where the
experiment station has come to the aid
of the farmer. It has also, in other
States, saved untold millions, of dol
lars to the fruit growers, tobacco and
cotton growers, and especially- to corn
growers.
So effective is the remedy and so
easily and cheaply applied that the
farmer to-day is in disrepute if he
grows smutted wheat. One pound of
formaldehyde to forty gallons of water,
applied to the grain with sprinkling

same solution with slight variation as
to strength is equally effective for pre-
Taking an average of but two bush
els less per acre on the whole crop, or
four bushels less per acre on half the
acreage sown annually, and we have
a loss of 10,000,090 bushels for a single
harvest.
Ten million bushels of wheat at 50
cents per bushel means a loss of $5,000,
000, plus $2,500,000 loss from
in price, and we have a grand total of
$7,500,000 loss per annum to the farmers
of the State. Mdklng any allowance one
may wish from the above figures for
extravagance of estimate, and still the
saving to the wheat growers is enor

extravagant one, in view of the rapid

straw badly Infested with smut, but
with little or no evidence of the disease
in the form of developed smut balls In
the head. A field of wheat so affected, it
was carefully estimated, would yield
from three to four bushels less per acre
than where the grain was free from the
disease.
What are the benefits accruing to the
farmers of the State from Investiga
tions of wheat smut? From the fact
that smutted and clean wheat could
not be kept separate In the elevators,
and as it required expensive machinery
to scour smutted wheat previous to
grinding it, it was conservatively es
timated by wheat dealers that, where
smut was generally prevalent. It meant
an average depression In price of at

An average 50,000,000-bushel crop

not all, nor the chief loss from smut.
The nature of the disease being para
sitical in character, it did not always
manifest its presence or evil effects In
the form of smut balls in the wheat

the weakening of the plant from the
disease, so that the yield was, in con
sequence, several bushels less per acre
and of inferior grade. Fields were fre-
THE new movement afoot for the
perfecting of the experiment
station, as a factor in the
development of the country's
agricultural resources, is not fully ap
preciated. It receives great credit, but
its actual cash value to the country
cannpt be estimated. Take the State
"of Xorth Dakota, for example. At a
time when the nature and characteris
tic* of wheat smut were but imperfect
ly understood and the disease was
ppreading with fearful rapidity
throughout the great wheat area of
the State, the experiment station
jproved the source of relief.
1 It. required a prodigious amount of
study and experimentation to fully
diagnose the disease and to discover a
pafe. epeedy and economical remedy.
Various remedies were found to be ef
fective, such as corrosive sublimate,
piitassium sulphide, hot water, forma
lin and other things, but most of them
were difficult to apply. Corrosive sub
limate is poisonous end consequently
dangerous, and also has a tendency to
retard germination. Hot water treat
ment is too delicate for the farmer to
use. Formaldehye was finally selected
a* a remedy that could be easily, ef
fectively and economically applied and
with perfect safety, and which instead
of retarding germination facilitates it.
Professor Bolley demonstrated that
the gain from the quicker germination

maldehyde fully or more than makes
up for the expense of the chemical and
the labor incident to Its application to
the. grain.
The apparatus, as described by Mx
Band of the Compressed Air Prun

to be carried about readily, and the ra
pidity with which the cutting knives
are brought into action, is limited only
by the speed of the operator in moving
a lever which offers no more resistance
than the turning of a door handle.

In California alone there are about
20,000,000 fruit trees and 200,000 acres of

Lucille to take chances. She would have to resort to the

her dates and play both ends against the middle. Which
is exactly what she did.
The system which she installed was a corker. When
Ollie had the right of way, she would 'phone Shine that
she had a. dreadful headache and that he must not think

To guard against a misinterpretation of signals she
would make Track Walkers of her kid brothers and keep
them on trie lookout until Ollie had gone.

MoralâA reserve fund is not always what it is cracked
up to be.
Although Cyrus had salted away several vaults full
of anti-Bryan coin and was old enough to remember a
good deal about what took place way back in the early
forties, he did not slow down one bit in his pursuit of the
znazuma.
The subject upon which the smooth citizens * had
set views was women. He was, $0 he said, utterly un
able to see how any man could let a woman trespass far
enough upon the corporate limits of his mentality to
cause him to lapse into a bug-house condition.
According to his way of thinking, the only way by
which an option could be secured on a woman's affec
tions was by writing her a lot of slush-gush-mush in
nursery dialect. It was, he alleged, past him to see how
any man could become ass enough about a female to
lose control of his pro, rata'of horse-sense and descend
to writing mellifluous melange. Further than that, he
argued that it was bum business policy'for a man to
get reckless with the . pen unless he knew for a dead
moral certainty that he wasn't running any risk.
Cyrus sai'd that he had, in the recent past, met a
little creature of the name of Letitia Larimore whom he
rushed for several weeks before side-stepping. And
while he had written her several times during that
period, he had not spilled, on Irish linen, any of the
soft stuff that makes the spiller look like a dub in the
eyes of an innocent third party.
He laid particular stress upon the fact that while
Letitia worked in the chorus to support a widowed
mother, she was thoroughly inexperienced and a most
estimable child. Their parting, which had not been
entirely unmixed with tears, was due solely to the fact
that he was too busy keeping tab on the market to give
her the time she deserved.
One morning, shortly after Cyrus had emitted a
rather lengthy installment of his views on the, subject
of emolliating epistles, he was visited by Mr. Katchem
tein of the law firm of Katchemstein, Soakemharder
"Say, old man, I'll make . it $15,000 if yon keep it

N'CE upon a time there was an old
V^5> . bachelor of the name of Cyrus
Â®'Â»(^ l^0_w Trimmcrs Â». who had thc gamc of
ff2ii^5i^/^J% finance down pat. He was the boss

: :g-5fr'?^%fr,raffi^l pull a withering security through a
spell of Dry-rot and at the same time make the criminal
code look like a joke book fresh from the press.
Cyrus was such a wonder at the game that he was
made president of several Billion Dollar Trusts, which
put him in pretty close touch with an income of about
seven thousand simoleons per second and caused the
common people to believe that he was just the foxiest
proposition that ever happened.
That's how strong Cyrus was with the inside push.
& Gctoutski. Upon seating himself in the i private
office beside Cyrus, Katchemstein announced that he
had been retained by Miss Letitia â¢ Larimore to enter
suit against him for the moderate sum of . $50,000. The
action was based upon a breach of; promise to marry
the aforementioned Letitia Larimore. Katchemstein
said; the sum demanded was exceedingly small in view
of the fact that; failure on the part of Cyrus to .make
good had injured the prospects of the unsophisticated
and confiding child, caused her to suffer untold humilia
tion, mental anguish, deprivation from other oppor
tunities to enter the marriage state, great loss of self-
pride, time,' energy and bodily health.
"Sir," said Cyrus when the lawyer had eased up fora
reply, "this is nothing but an . outrageous attempt to
hold rac up. I 'have never entertained the slightest idea
of marrying this person whom you represent. I never
proposed marriage to her. Kever, never, never. It is
preposterous. I will not permit myself to be flim
flammed by such a designing [creature. I have made no
promises to her. It is extortion. I defy â "

NEW CONTEST TO-DAY
9t T the beginning of the
m 8eventh Series of these
-Â»â¢ fascinating puzzle con
tests the Puzzle Editor will
take pleasure in having a lit
tle personal and friendly
chat with you all, in which
advantage will be taken of
this opportunity to explain a
few very meddlesome facts.
First, many of you chil
dren will wonder why, dur
ing the past few weeks, some
of your books have been
somewhat tardy in arriving*.
Let it be pointed- out that it
is due principally to the
stormy weather that has
been sweeping the entire Pa
cific Coast for a month past,
.which has delayed trains and
other means of traffic to such
an extent that traffic is
blockaded everywhere be
tween San Francisco and
the principal Eastern cities.
m Indeed, just at the present
time an immense shipment
of EIGHT THOUSAND of the
beautiful books that THE
SUNDAY CALL is now giv
ing away as prizes are block
aded somewhere between
here and the Eocky Moun
tains and consequently can
not arrive for almost two
weeks yet. However, these
EIGHT THOUSAND BOOKS,
or at least a goodly part of
them, will he secured in time
to fill the list of ONE HUN
DKED AM) FIFTY PKIZE
WIMERS, in this, the first
contest, of the Seventh Series
and everjr week thereafter.
It is for that reason that
some twenty copies of "The
Little Lame Prince" and
"The Magric Nuts" have not
heen delivered, notwith
standing the whole coast
has been scoured for stray
books to fill these orders, and
consequently the little chil
dren who l\ave chosen either
of the above titles will have
to be patient for a week or
two. The Puzzle Editor as
sures them, however, that
their orders will be filled
first as soon as the EIGHT
THOUSAND BOOKS arrive.
And to those who are well
on* their way toward the col
lection of a complete library
the Puzzle Editor wants to
give further assurance that
this new consignment are all
of the same edition of beau
tiful colored landscape books
.so that none of their series
will be broken.

'will not jump the Hne.
The running wheels are in the : cen

shaped structure, at the apex of which
is the rail. The underworks of the car
riage hang down on each side and there
is an it Jous arrangement of hori

When the ' train *akes a curve the
pressure falls - upon these horizontal
â¢wheels and there is practically, no more
risk-in turning curves than in running
straight. Mr. Behr, the inventor, said

â¢ Isabella has t another weakness be
sides'artists and musicians, and that
is for policemen, .provided 'they, top,
be young and handsome. Isabella is
very, particular about her bodyguard
and finds it difficult to fill its ranks
with men who are both efficacious and
good looking. She has been known to
stop her carriage in the Champs Ely
sees to hail a policeman and invite him
to call at the Palais de Castille if he
wanted to enter her royal service, and
on one occasion, sitting. in her box at
the opera, she sent one I of her secre
taries up to the peanut gallery to make
similar, overtures to a, pleasing young
policeman whom she had spied through
her opera glass. The * policemen are
naturally compelled 'Â¦ ' refer her ; gra
cious Majesty. to the Prefect of Police;
and Isabella bears a serious grudge
against Monsieur 'Lepine for the fact
that he has never once granted the
transfer of a' man from his staff to
hers. Â¦ 'Â¦ â¢
In summer ex-Queen Isabella has no
fixed residence,' but. leases for the sea
son nme historic chateau. One year it
will' be on the Riviera, and ' the next
in Normandy or in Touraine. Last
summer she was near Fontainebleau,
where she ' received her daughter-In-
tion and proceeds to examine him. If
he be homely, in the -royal eyes or if
a. gray hair or two gives an" impression
of premature \ rge. Isabella has him
ushered^out without parley. â¢ââ¢ If, on the
contrary, he passes inspection, he.must
then sit down at the 'piano, and- inter
pret classical pieces and his own-com
positions,' or else produce specimens of
his drawing and painting. . If the ; ex-
Queen approves, he is put' down on -the
list and his future is assured* Every
quarter a check is sent to him. for his
current expenses, and ever after he is
supposed to i call, at fixed intervals at

The most important event in Isabel
la's near future is her meeting with
Alfonso XIII when the latter ofli
cially visits Paris next, spring. She
loathes her grandson with such inten
sity that members of her court never
dare - mention his 'name before her,
knowing that it would, precipitate a
scene. But she considers that her rank
has 'its obligations, and she is prepar
ing to entertain Alfonso right roy
ally. There is, perhaps, only one opin
ion which the two have iir common, and
on the strength of which they "are pret
ty sure not to quarrel; and that is dis
like for Americans.
Cabinet Mi 'sters have followed the
lead of their chief and have never
called officially on Isabella; but their
wives are sometimes glad to call, and
there is not an aspirant or a has-been
of the political - world who Joes . not
seek admission to the ex-Queen's court
circle, and Isabella r^oeives them all in
view of the fact- the* they, cy some
day come to power and will n-t forget
her. As for the % French aristocracy, it
car~-' afford to slight a Bourbon, how
ever little it may approve of the old
Queen and her mode of life. And thus
it is that the republican element stands
at Isabella's levees -elbow, to elb.w with
Dukes and Marquises, such- as the De
Rohans, De la â¢' Rochefoucaulds, De
Bethuncs, De Luynes and other prince
ly houses of France. Â»
In spite of her great ageâ she was 73
at her last birthday â Isabella leads a
comparatively active' life. "' Colossally
rich, she nevertheless believes in house
hold economy, and' while not stinting
herself for anything, which may add to
her comfort or enjoyment, she person
ally inspects every detail of domestic
expenditure and sees that it Is reduced
to a minimum. But while careful al
most to the point of stinginess in this
respect, she enter' ains lavishly, she
loves fine horses and carriages fo,r her
daily drives, and her charities are enor
mous.
" However, In regard to her charities
as" .in other respects, ex-Queen Isabella,
has he^ own ideas. She never responds
to any petition for pecuniary assist
ance, and rarely adds her name to any
subscriptions, but she has two weak
nesses. Me ' -lartre musicians - and
Latin Quarter artists, on whom she will
squander her gold In unlimited quanti
ties, provided they be young, handsome
and talented. She. herself always
Judges these qualities. She has a spe
cial detachment of secretar'â who have
l.. other duty but to inform her of
new discoveries among the meritorious,
and to report the conduct of those al
ready under the queenly wing.'
When the secretaries hav~ reported
favorably on the subject of any one,
Â¦the C"ccn sends for the perc. x in aues-
of the former, and that is her greatest
cross in life; wherefore it is just possi
ble that the ruse of the old ex-Queen
may succeed, and that through the
good graces of Madame de Saint-Prix,
seconded by Madame Loubet, Isabella
may some day find diplomatic relations
established between the Elysee and the
Palace of Castille. . ;
- EX-QUEEN'S FRIENDS. Â¦
"uncU nne noblesse" of l . nee meet
members of the republican set in so
ciety. Isabella has never been offi
cially recognized by a French Presi
dent, and has i ever been received at
the ,:iysee â the French White Houseâ
and in the hope of improving her rela
tions some day she has formed a close
'intimacy with Madame de Saint-Prix,
Lonbet's daughter.
President Loul â¢?. for himself, has re
tard his 6imple country Pastes, but

Loubet was elected President of the

Loul t devoted two solid months to a
study of the French peerage and pro
locolary laws. The latter have been
rnon useful to her, but stfe has never
be<n ab*? to profit by her- knowledge
Several hundred such appointments
are made each y*ar by her, causing un
told tribulations to the Spanish Embas
sador, the Marquis del Muni, an old
friend of Isabella, whom he does not
like to disoblige, while at the same
time he is com. elled to respect the au
thority of his young liege lord, Al
fonso XIII. But Alfonso, while
brought up to conrlljr his royal grand
mamma as a holy horror, is neverthe
less indulgent toward her. and, prompt
ed by Del Muni, generally confirms a
limited number of decorations for her.

PARIS, March 26.â Though- fallen
from power, and living in exile for
thirty-five yearp, ex-Queen Isabella of
Spain still VeepS up the semblance of
a court in Paris. aÂ»d surrounds her
self with chamberlains and secretaries
and gentlemen of the royal household,
to Bay nothing of courtiers and petty
officials of all descriptions. At her bi
monthly levees, she receives as a reign
ing Queen at her residence, the Palais
de Castille in the Avenue Kleberâ and
nothing in the world could induce her
to return a call. She even pushes her
delusion of power to the extent of con
ferring decorations on her favorites,

It Is to his mother, Helen, Lady

'. The next that was heard of Hannaa
was when the American Consul, Mr.
de Castro, was told by the police that
they had found a woman lying in the
streets of Rome, who seemed to be an
American. The unfortunate was again
dying of hunger and exposure and to
repeated appeals would only reply, "Let
me die: let me dial" The authorities
cared for her. butMt only took a mo
ment for one of her own nationality
to understand that suffering had had
its effect, and that she was no longer
capable of \ giving a connected story.
She was put in a house. of restraint,
but being so gentle and melancholy,
was not > sufficiently well watched, she
escaped, fled Into the country, about
two miles from Rome, and laid herself
on .the railway tracks. The searchers
found her Just in time to drag her off
as a train thundered by. â¢ Again her
wail was, "I want to die, why have
you- prevented- me!" She is quite in

LADY- ABINGER'S FORTUNE.
that such a thing should happen to an
American in Italy, and in consequence,
says my Rome correspondent, the Ital
ians are deeply interested in the sad
story of a woman now in detention in
Rome. Hannah Jackson Stevens, or
Stevens Jackson, of Raleigh, North
Carolina, a woman about 35 years of
age, who- must once have been comely,
finding herself without means or friends
at home, and having heard in a vague
way of the sunny skies -of Italy, and
that the people could live happily, on
a few cents a day, . determined , to try
her luck there. No one knows how
she got to Naples, and the next link in
the story is when a peasant near Capua,
having gone into the forests to gather
wood,, suddenly came, upon the body
of what -he took for a dead woman.
With the instinct of the Italian peasant
against anything dead, he fled, but
curiosity, fortunately, overcame super
stition, and he returned to find, out
who- it was. . Her^heart was, still beat
ing, so he carried her to the village,
where the good people soon put her
to bed andhad a doctor in 'attendance.
Apparently, she had been in the wood
without food for l days.- She wag
wasted to a skeleton, her sodden
clothes clinging'to lief . limbs; as there
had just been one of the worst storms
of the season, while her matted hair
was full of leaves and twigs, masses of
it being between her fingers, pulled
from her head in her agony. "
PREPARING A KING'S BATH.
The .alterations originally planned
were nearing completion when the new
order was issued, and the builders had
some dlfllculty in finding a room that
to their view could be conveniently con
verted into an electric bath to accomo
date such an important personage as
the King. The Duchess met the diffi
culty by insisting that if her . own
boudoir had to be , sacrificed the bath
must be constructed. Luckily," the late
owner, of Kylemore had the castle sup
plied with its own electric light installa
tion, otherwise the Duke and Duchess
would have to- spend some thousands of
dpllars now to fit. up a : bath for the
King.
Nothing attracted King Edward's at
tention so much durfhg his last visit
to Skibo Castle as Mr Carnegie's
luxurious swimming baths. He insist
ed upon having a plunge and after he
had 'emerged he expressed a wish that
he could have a similar luxury at one
of â¢ his own palaces. But j in spite of
the fact that the Skibo baths are ac
knowledged to be the most luxuriously
equipped in Europe they do not satisfy
Mr. Carnegie. Since he left for the
United States a number of workmen
have been overhauling, them, giving an
additional polish to the beautiful mar
ble of, which they are constructed. A
service of Russian and Turkish baths
is being installed.
From The Netherlands comes renewed
reports that poor little" Queen Wilhel
mina is looking' sad and greatly differ
ent from the radiant girl -whose wed
ding is still fresh in the memory of all.
It is true that her fa^e is round and
chubby, but the girlishness has van
ished, and in its place has appeared a
set. expression of forced calmness. The
sturdy, phlegmatic Hollanders ,Â¦ shake
their heads dubiously when they speak
of her. They will not admit that their
idolized young sovereign can be at all
in fault. All ; is set down fo the score
of the Prince Consort, who is said -to
be : - dogged of temper and somewhat
devoid of tact. Â¦ . ,
CHARITY FOR AX AMERICAN.
''Although : it is common enough for
Americans to hear of cases of want and
suffering among the Italian's who flit to
their shores, it is almost unprecedented
LONDON, March 26.â Kylemore Cas
tle, the recently acquired Irish home of
the Duke and Duchess of Manchester,
is competing with Windsor Castle and
Buckingham Castle in the matter of
equipment. In the accounts of the
extensive alterations that have been
proceeding there for months past, c-ne
important detail has escaped observa
tion. The fact that the King has had
recourse to electric light baths since
his coronation illness had been over
looked by the Duke and Duchess when
the specifications of the alterations were
submitted to. them. When it . became
known that his Majesty would, stay
at Kylemore during. his tour in the west
of Ireland and "the Duchess .becoming
acquainted with the fact that- Windsor
and Buckingham palaces were supplied
with the , electric baths, from '.which
King "Edward had received so much
benefit, she" gave instructions-, that a
similar bath must be installed at Kyle

lifetime, has now come to her. but also
the London house Jn Cornwall Gardens,
and Inverlochy Castle in Inverness
shirc. One of the reasons for this
curious send-back of the family pos
sessions is that the late Lord Abinger's
kinsman and heir presumptive was
married to a Roman Catholic and he
could not endure the idea of a Roman
Catholic reigning: at Inverlochy. so hav
ing the power to da so he willed almost
everything he possessed to his mother.

ECHOES FROM THE LODGE ROOM
18Mrs. Fiske, in "Hedda Gabler," at the
Grand Opera-house, is the chief at
traction of the dramatic week here. It
will be the first time Mrs. Fiske has
played the part, locally made known to
us by a few matinee performances by
Nance O'Neill- arid Blanche Bates, and
profound interest attaches to the inter
pretation. Mrs. Fiske is a deep student
of .the Ibsen school,-, and a famous
Hedda, and she will be ably supported
by the. clever company, by which she
has surrounded herself. .
Mary Mannering and her company,
that includes Arthur " Byron^ Thomas
Rice and others good, will continue at
the Columbia in "their highly, amus
ing comedy. "Harriet's Honeymoon,"
in which . Miss Mannering is seen to
much 1 advantage.
Then 'there's excellent fare at the
WEEK'S BILL REPLETE
' * WITH MANY BRIGHT
AND NEW ATTRACTIONS
lively wit that I am hopeless of sug
gesting.
I told her that I despaired of see
ing anything better than her fourth act
of Monday evening, but had intended
to ' come before Jier suggestion and
added: "That scene, by the way, is a
good example of your psychological
drama. Yet I am sure it was pro
foundly appreciated by your first night
audience."
' "I was so stupid," she said simply.
"But it is, a good example. You see,
there is nothing done, very little said.
THE AUDIENCE * DOES MOST OF
THE ACTING. It is-the struggle be
tween one spiritual prbblem and an
other... Mr. . Heyse has imagined the
strongest possible temptations . . to
Mary's hardly won purity, the tempta
tion to save her Redeemer with the
price of it." -
And then I discovered behind the
Ibsenism, problem plays, endowed
drama, and such small things among
Mrs. Fiske's interests, that which she
really cares for, the happiness of the
dumb brothers about us. ' Fascinating
in every phase, the actress becomes
most lovable here. "Do you- care
about such things?" she began, almost
timidly.- "I feel so .strongly about
them." :
Then she. spoke of;the Spanish bull
fights, of. trap-shooting, of the; Ameri
can mother who puts a gun into the
hands of T her boy to, shoot the little
feathered '. things . for ! fun, for sport.
She '.told-' of the cattle, she had seen
within the last few weeks frozen . to
death, by scores all for the want of a
little careâ "such; hopelessly uncon
scious cruelty."- She spoke of fawns
left ; starving by the . death of their
mother In . the. Adironacks, ,, of deer,
half killed, eaten to death by flies. All
this without hysterics and useless emÂ«
phasis. ' '
But there were tears in the brilliant
purple one for San Francisco. "But
what is the use of about it?
Still, we could establish a drarfatic
standard that way. And we stand for
so much in the world already "
"Materially?" I venture.
"Oh, yes; but the opera, too, you
know. At least the experiment would
be a worthy one. And we have all so
much to learn, actors and public."
"Mrs. Fiske, this isn't apropos, but
weren't you nervous onMonday.nlght?"
"Yes, being tired," Â»she confessed.
"Then first night audiences â I do not
speak of San Francisco now, and â "
she put her warm hand impulsively
on mine â "it's ridiculous to say It in
San Francisco, but I love the San
â¢Francisco audience. 'First night au
diences are almost always curious.
They're expecting thrills, hysterics,
the sensational thing, in a word. And
when we haven't that kind of thing
to give they're disappointed. .We get
the wave of disappointment and the
wave of expectancy, and the audi
ence suffers for it. It cheats itself.
The psychological drama is almost al
ways a disappointment to a first night
houee. They want what is done and
said, not the thought behind. I've
seen many rfctournful looking crowds
come oÂ©t from a Duse first night. No,
your thoughtful auditor somehow
seems to come later in the week. He's
often your first night man, too. I have
frequently had men who write, for
example, come to. me after the second
sight of a play and . say: .'Why!: I
didn't get this at all the first night'
I want you," she broke off, "to come
to see the 'Mary of Magdala'. at the
matinee. Will you? If I am welMt
will -be much better; -I hope, than on
Monday night."
Time and again this samecharming
humility was shown and throughout
a conscience, a fearlessness, a breadth
Of thought, a sincerity of purpose, a'
hazel eyes as she concluded: "It is good
to see that' President Roosevelt, whom
all boys naturally take as their pat
tern, goes a-hunting no longer."
We fell again then to "Hedda Gab
ler," and the actress sketched * with
terse brilliance the strange character
that she will assume this week, sketch
ed Tesman, Lonborg, Brack in a half
dozen luminous phrases that set them
livlngly before one as the certain line
of a Whistler. We talked of Duse and
her art,' of the Sardou drama, of "Mon
na Vanna" that Mrs. Fiske will play,
of a score or more of other things, and
then she laughed as I came away and
an unmistakable giggle stole through
the little curtained door of her room:
"You know, I bribed those girls /to
be quiet outside. I bribed them not to
let any one talk. Do you wonder they
laughâ at us?" :" ~

Press-agentry is a curious art and

specimen, relative to Mr. Melbourne
MacDowell, who will shortly reappear
here:
"Dear Madamâ I am sending you
some press stuff from Dave A. Weis,
manager, concerning the Melbourne
MacDowell engagement in San Fran
cisco. Mr. Weis is making stupendous
preparations for the coast engagement
and the ~ scenery, coupled with every
thing else that is composed in the
make-up of a really excellent perform
ance, will be of very high standing.
Mr. MacDowell is much changed since
his last coast engagement and he seems
now to realize that he must retrieve
himself in the next two seasftns and
regain the laurels lost through his ap
parent careless ways. For this reason
Mr. Weis has selected for his associates â¢
a company of splendid players with
metropolitan reputations.
"We "can assure you that we are try

dramatic stock company which will be
the strongest ever seen on the coast.

take one full year for the proper pro
duction ot the play, and I haven't had
that yet. But I'm afraid I'm very
stupid!"
"The gods grant me all the Fiske
stupidity going!" I put it. But I left
her then, with the privilege of a later
chat during the week.
Our next tryst, amusingly, was at
the Hammam baths. Thursday
dawning had found Mra. Fiske sleep
less and still tired. I found her my
self at noon with the rose and fresh
ness of new sleep upon her. It was
pleasant to go in out of the rain, and
Mrs. Fiske was all her vivid, brilliant
self.
"I'm still stupid," she prefaced as I
entered the little cabin where she lay.
"I was hoping so," I said. "We left
off at 'Hedda Gabler' j'ou remember?
I've seen two Heddas. by the way,
Nance O'Neil's and Blanche Bates.
Miss Bates' was too wholesome to my
thinking." I proffered.
"And I?â" she smiled. "Must one be
morbid, I wonder, to understand Hed
da? At least one must understand
everything, is it not, even 'to the dregs? 1
"Pity, isn't it, that Ibsen cared so
little for beauty?" I ventured.
"Beauty is very difficult to defln?,"
the actress remarked slowly. "To me
the Ibsen drama is now in much the
same position, relatively to modern
drama, as was the Wagner music
drama some years ago to Italian opera.
You remember the criticisms, 'ugly,'
'dreadful,' 'bizarre,' all sorts of con
demnation was heaped upon it. Yet
the same sounds now are accepted as
beautiful. The truth is that there is an
evolution of beauty, and we may even
ccme to consider Ibsen beautiful. Ho
is certainly the most enthralling among
the masters of stagecraft â a flaming,
angry, raging northern star!" she
flashed.
"And 'Rosmersholm' is chief of the
Ibsen constellation?"
"It ranks, I think," she answered
thoughtfully, "with the great love
stories of the world, with the 'Tristan
and Isolde,'- with 'Romeo and Juliet.'
Hasn't Rebecca West been called the
'Lady Macbeth of the North?' Ibsen
is so wonderful in that you never get
to the end of him. Par exemple. There
are as many Heddas as there are ac
tresses who interpret herâ just as there
are Hamlets. Not only that, but each
actress finds something new in the part
every time she plays it. Only enormous
genius could create a character of such
range."
"Pinero?"
"Oh," Mrs. Fiske shrugged her shoul
ders, her eyes twinkling with tolerant
amusement. "Pinero is a very nice
little follower, a pretty little reflection,
a pale flame of the Ibsen school. He's
been influenced naturally. Every play
wright worth anything has. But I
shouldn't say so, should I? He may
charge me double royalties when I
want a play!" Then frankly, and with
the almost masculine fearlessness that
characterizes her, she said: "But why
shouldn't I s.ay so? It's true. Ibsen
begins â begins, my dear â where all
other modern dramatists end."
"But where are your players? 1 ' I
aek, "though I've found that Ibsen
plays are singular in that they get the
best from the actor. But really to play
them â "
"The people â do you really want to
suggest something useful?" and Mrs.
Fiske sat up among her pillows to ask
me this, her fatigue forgotten. "Some
times I think it may be worth
saying, no one ever knows. The
people, to answer your question first,
who should be playing Ibsen plays are
starring at the head of the various
companies. You cannot blame them.
They have to consider the material side
of things."
"Ah! you are thinking of the national
theater," I in'terrupt.
"No, no," the actress said, "nothing
so ambitious. But why not get to
gether a company of the same artistic
caliber as the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany, and let us have plays produced
as the operas are produced. Nothing
could be easier. It would be incompar
ably less expensive, to begin with that
end of it â and one always has to. There
would be the large orchestra and the
chorus both eliminated. N6r would it
cost so much to group together a com
pany of actors of the highest attain
ments as to get together a similar com
pany of opera singers. It only re
mains for some few men to supply
the money. I believe myself that it
would be an excellent investment."
"And the pleasure of seeing that kind
of a company!" I 'cried.
"And the pleasure of playing in it,"
said Mrs. Fiske. "I would rather play
a small part in that kind of production
than star in any other kind. But you
cannot expect the actor to abandon his
rewards."
"The opera singers do not," I contrib
ute. "Now, where would your company
play?"
"In New York for a season and then
tour," the actress planned, marking off
NewYork on a gay yellow stripe on her
coverlid, and skipping to an opposite
Tivoli, that continues "Mr. Pickwick"
for the week. This musical comedy
has "caught on."

and suggestion, on the pillow be
fore me.
1 ' "You arje ill?" I asked, as she gave
me her firm little hand.
â¢ ' "Tired â just very tired," she said,
and. I saw then the confirming circles
.around her eyes. "A strange city,
strange people, and I am foolishly
.' sensitive. It is nothing. I need an
â¢ hour or two of rest â "
â¢ : "I'm sorry to bother you to-day â "
"Oh, is this to be an interview? I
| thought you were just coming to see
ine," she [exclaimed. This in the
piquant staccato of her Becky Sharp.
It was distinctly appealing, as she sug
gested then: "Let us put it off for a
day or twoâ say until next week.
There is no excuse for an interview un
less one has something to say. And I
can't think of anything to-day. There
are tilings, too, I should really like
to say. I haven't given any inter
views for some few years. Come next
week, and you shall have all the pearls
of wisdom I've been storing up."
I weakened, but protested:
"But, Mrs. Fiske, every, one will
â¢svant to hear from the star of the
week as soon as possible."
.."2Â»onsense! What does it matter?"
the. laughed, quietly. "1 really have
nothing interesting to say to-dayâ"
.1 compromised then. "Perhaps later
â¢ in the week, then; and we'll just gos
tip now. And if not we will talk next
' week."
â¢' 'Twould be better. Will you put that

7 Tuesday at 2. Put the thing where it
! will- face me â "
"On the mirror." I laughed, "where
pretty womenâ"
' â¢ "Bah! I'm not pretty," she retorted;
Â¦ â¢ then with a delicious little whimsical
twinkle added, "at least not to-day. I'm
â¢â¢beautiful sometimes, of courseâ those
â¢ iiays you look in the mirror and are
surprised at the lovely thing you see!"
."What color are theyâ the eyes?" I
inquired audaciously.
â¢ "To-dayâ I don't know," she said,
naively shutting them.
.'â¢Xor do I know, and I had a long hour
.to find out. They flashed gray light
."nlnga when Mrs. Fiske spoke of trap
' footingâ of the "courage, ability,
â¢character" required of the pigeon-in
'the-slot sportsman. They were black
. v/hen she talked of the Spanish bull
ftpht. with its gored horses stuffed with
'. oakum to enable the wretched creatures
â¢ to meet again the horns of the bull.
Thpy w.ere, again, warmest hazel when
"their owner spoke of the new Society
- for" the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani
mals in Mexico, that "has already pre
.V f-nted much suffering." For these are
. .he things that are nearest the heart of
â¢llrs. Fiske, the first actress in America.
â¢ As for the rest, the red-gold hair lay
â¢â¢ t-traightly across the brow, tossed into
â¢ a sumptuous, glistening knot above it,
and I began to discover a firm, round
i'hin and mouth, and a round white
throat under the outlining of the deli
cate purples of a kimono.
â¢ "You know," the actress began, "it is
fm possible always to be at one's best.
' This fashion of ours of playing every
-night is brutal. The French and the
Germans rightly despise us for it. One

the- week. that are wholly worthy. The
rest â well, you can't keep the blush on
the work, you know â "
: . "Familiarity breeds contempt?"
" '.Exactly," Mrs. Fiske agreed, "famil
iarity is fatal here, as in almost every
other relation."
I queried then, "But could you count
: " on' the fortunate mood with any more
o rtainty than now in the three nights
;, week regime?"
â¢â¢â¢"I think so," the actress decided.
'. "One has just so much vitality, and
â¢ 'there wÂ»uld be that much more to go
round. I wonder" â Mrs.- Fiske put that
â¢ significant little forefinger of hers to
her cheek and looked with level eyes at
the â "I wonder if you have thought how
â¢ cruel â shall I say â even the kindest crit
ics can be? This is entirely impersonal,
" of course. But you will find such things
as" these happening in the actor's pro
fession all the time. One will be ill, say,
on a first night in a new piece. The
" . critics will, of course, be familiar with
â¢ * one's reputation. Suppose It good, and
' suppose the critic just and competent.
He finds tlie particular performance
' bad. It is bad. But he will simply say,
in nine cases out of ten, that the per
formance is badâ not that there must
be' a good reason, in view of one's re
jÂ»ute. for its inadequacy."
'Paris and Duse â "
"Ah! Paris and D;use! A perfect
example," the actress agreed. She
r lasp^d her vital, eloquent little hands
as" she said: "Think of it! Those ex

that nightâ it was 'CamiHe* you re

Ultra-human one had almost begun
to believe Mr. Bauer until the saving
imperfections of his last performance.
The comment is late? Just one day
after the legitimate nine days of won
der. Neither for the Bauerite late at
all, but still the burning question.
'Twas a gracious weakness. We had
come to fancy Mr. Bauer a kind of
musical over-man â insensible to t^e
little human frailties of mood, im
pervious to fatigue of the body or of
the spirit. Yet he is still a little lower
than the angels, one finds not alto
gether ungratefully. But why say so?
Because there were those who heard
Mr. Bauer for the first time on that
last Wednesday afternoon â those to
whom his lost notes, as in the Chopin
Funeral March trio, his wrong
notes, a3 in the Schumann Carnival;
his frequent muddying of tone by the
pedals on that day, might seem in
trinsic characteristics of the pianist'3
aft, and not the unholy accident of
mood. On the night before, in the
Schumann Eantasle. Mr: Bauer had
touched the apex of his achievement.
Such flow humanly indicated an ebb.
To expect the maintenance of such a
height were to demand the Alps with
out their valleys. Truth to tell, one
concert followed the other too soon,
and the new audience of the second
has not yet heard, perhaps the great
est of living pianists as he is.
And yet. Remember that Funeral
March of Chopin, in which those lower
notes were dropped Into Mr. Bauer's
pocket or under the piano. Remember
the massive, majestic tread of the
rhythm, certain as death itself. Re
member those bass trills, in which the
pianist contrived so marvelously to
suggest the stern roll of drums. Re
member the tone of the melody of the
trioâ and forget the lost notes. The
treatment of the opening bass meas
ures, by the way, a pesante non legato,
was peculiarly interesting, and in my
experience, original with Mr. Bauer.
The finale of the sonata again was
brilliantly handled. Not, as frequently,
did .the movement come as an anti
climax. Chopin, in following the fun
eral march with this measure, set one
of the most difficult tasks of interpre
tation the pianist has to encounter.
By means of his colossal technique,
equally with his superb insight, Mr.
Bauer solved it. The aftermath of
death the movement Inevitably sug
gests, and what more like the sweep
and trouble of lost winds about a dead
world than the Bauer reading? All
sense of the mechanism was lost. The
thing seemed to be done with a brush
rather than with notes. There was a
race, a rush, a shriek, hum, murmur of
tone, and that was all. It was a reve
lation.
The Carnaval was wonderful In spots,
but not at all what the finest Schu
mann interpreter of the day can give.
It was the first number of the pro
gramme and in parts the least satisfy
ing â Mr. Bauer has only himself to
thank for thÂ» exacting nature of one's
demands! He became himself quite
with the Air de Ballet of Gluck-Saint-
Saens, a handful of filmy lace and roses
tossed our way with surpassing grace.
From many points of view the Bach
Toccata, given here for the first time,
was the most interesting number of all.
It is a recent discovery â but this valu
able little note of Oscar Weil's win
better give its history. For myself â
dare I say it?â a first hearing did not
bring me strongly under the charm of
the movement. I should, Indeed, have
hesitated to ascribe some portions of
the work to Father Bach, though of all
the great composers he is perhaps the
most varied. And it must be remem
bered that in Bach's case familiarity
breeds homage. But here Is Mr. Weil's
opinion, of which you all know the
worth: .
"(2. Toccataâ Fantasie and Fugue â
in D, Bach.) This double title is found
in tfie original manuscript among the
latest of the important works of the
master printed by the 'Bach Gesell
schaft.' The piece seems to be little
known as yet, but will undoubtedly in
time take its place with the master
pieces, since it bears the stamp of
Bach's finest work of his best period.
There are virtually two separate Toc
catas to be found in it, together with a
Fugue of an almost unrivaled charm
and grace; these three movements aro
seperated (bound to each other, rather)
by phrases of such recitative improvi
sation as only Bach could write; the
result Is a supe'rly built, thoroughly
coherent composition in the largest
style."
Better instance of Mr. Bauer's sub
tlety of art than his Bach treatment
could not be afforded. Actually the man
suggests a spinet in the connection!
His good-by was characteristic. The
last of him, seen by a few of us who
stood in front of the hall that day, was
half a radiant face, under an old
slouch hat that Me Bauer cannot be
persuaded to abandon, thrust through
the rain cover of an automobile.

Who of the orthodox school could
reconcile their lenten notions of se
clusion with the actualities of last week
'âa week fraught with gay propensi
ties? But then, dear goodly censor,
bear well in mind that most of the
affairs were builded upon a base of
charityâand therein lieth no sin.
".Retrogression in society?" Why, there
dors seem to be a less rigorous lenten
regimen followed by church people
now than in years agone, but the ser
'vices in the temples of worship have
been rather well attended during the
weeks of penitence. "Mostly old la
dies?" Well. that, too, is true, but the
younger people are hardly less religious
âin spirit â than they ever were. And,
after all, its the spirit, rather than acts
enforced by habit, that makes for char
acter. Therefore, be it resolved: That
the young folk are not religious rene
gades because of their little lenten re
laxations, for. behold the pain and sor
row that have thus been relieved
through the generous tax at the box
' office.
. Leading the philanthropic functions
of the week were the Indian tea at Mrs.
George Law Smith's for the benefit of
the Animals' Refuge.
Here an entertainment of ethnologi
'cai character was given for three days
-a-nd nights, when the Sioux and the
Seminole met on neutral grounds, and
cajoled the paleface into yielding up his
ducats for the dogs and pussy cats who
Â¦have not the languorous luxury of a
home. At these functions. Mrs. John
Â¦Lo.oseley made the distinct hit of the
hour by her clever crooning of Indian
â¢Jullabies. A splendid sum was realized
for- the refuge, bringing thereby a rare
joy to the president. Miss Maud Smith,
and to her heroic co-worjeers.
Then topping all affairs of like char
.acter since the imperishable Cafe
Chantant, was the circus and horse
show of the Doctor's Daughters.
' Now, ye whose memories are of such
retentive type as to recall your first

Added to the other trials and tribu

exceptionally annoying one of keeping
the 'livery of their servants, exclusive.

stockings and low-cut leather shoes
for her,- servants* day wear, -and black
velvet jackets with frogs and brass em

calls up her tarlor and has him draft
the self-same regalia for her retinue.
Poor Mrs. A! Now, Isn't that about all
the sorrow one can bear with Christian
fortitude?
..One of the cleverest hostesses of the
winter, is Mrs. Arthur Spear, who has
entertained extensively and been enter

shining black satin, a one-piece gown
that flew out into a momentous train

quite the largest earrings that any

daughter was clad in an equally severe
and very tight-fitting gown of oyster
white cloth that flew out into- a train
only slightly less prodigious than that
of her mother. Being a demoiselle, no
jewels nor decorations of any kind

BERLIN. March 26.â The Socialists
lost a Reichstag seat, that of Chop
pau, Saxony, yesterday to an anti-
Semite. The vacancy was due to the
death of Herr Rosenow, who won the
seat In 1898 and was re-elected in 1903
by 3740 majority. The Socialist can
didate, Herr Pinkau, has now been
defeated by 1C00 votes, owing to the
disaffection of Socialist voters because
the National Committee interfered
with the local management of the
campaign.
The district leaders unanimously
nominated former Pastor Goehre, who
had resigned another seat in Septem
ber, owing to Herr Bebel's attacks on
him at the Dresden convention. But
the national leaders, after Herr Goehre
had begun a vigorous campaign, pro
nounced against his candidacy and
forced his retirement. The Socialist
voters as a result became disgusted
and did not vote.

when about a mile from Pakchieng,
sighted a mounted post. of the enemy,
consisting of thirty men, which, on the
approach of our. sotnia, was reinforced
by, infantry. â¢ Our Cossacks requested
the support of two half companies and
opened fire against the post and pa
trol at 400 yards. One of the soldiers
and a horse of the enemy were taken.
On learning that the enemy's infantry
was advancing,- our patrol, fired two

Â¦; ST. .PETERSBURG,, March 26.â A
telegram from i Viceroy Alexleff has
been, received by. the Czar. : It gives a
report from t General/ Mishtchencko,
.which includes . the . following from
General Smyrnoff, dated Port Arthur:
A statement comes from Vladivostok
to the effect' that Captain,Reitzen
steln's sauadron returned to port tow
ing a second-class Japanese cruiser.
The inhabitants and the garrison, he
added, gave a reception to the victors.
The capture, however, is not confirmed
in official , circles.
The departure of naval reinforce
ments from the Baltic will leave a fair
ly strong squadron â¢ of coast > defense
and other ships to protect. Russia's
European coast line.
. The preservation of Admiral Maka
roff's squadron Intact is regarded as
of vital importance, as it is now cer
tain that the Admiralty plans contem
plate sending powerful reinforcements
from the Baltic during the summer.
Six battleships and three cruisers will
be ready to sail in July, Joining the
squadron of Admiral Wirenius in the
Mediterranean, and, with the torpedo
boats, reach P,prt Arthur In Sep
tember. The . arrival 6f such a fleet
would give the Russians an.; over
whelming: preponderance in â¢ numbers.
The Russian plans all look forward to
the time when, with the co-operation
of the fleet, the Japanese communica
tions' can be dut off. 1 Then General
Kuropatkin," according; to Russian cal
culations, will, be in a;position to take
the offensive on land, and settle the
fate of the campaign and. the war.
To-night the Emperor received tele
grams announcing the general's arrival
at Harbin and bringing word that mob
ilization of the Manchurian army was
completed. It is said that to-morrow
General Kuropatkin will review the
Mukden troops and .will read to them
a message expressing the imperial con
fidence that the soldiers will display
valor and fortitude befitting the tradi
tions of the Russian army. General
Kuropatkin will afterward proceed to
Liaoyang. Thence he will make a fly-'
ing visit to Port Arthur to Inspect the
fortress.
It is rumored here that the Russian
forces will' not withdraw to the strong
line of defense prepared at Fenghuang
if General Kuropatkin decides that he
can get together a sufficient number of
men to make a stand at the Yalu River
advisable. ' , .
Important news is drifting to St. Pe
tersburg by mail. A letter, from Dalny
draws a picture of its defenseless con
dition when the Japanese attacked
Port Arthur. The correspondent says
that the smallest Japanese force could
easily have captured Dalny and de
stroyed enormous Btores of coal, 500,000
pounds of tea and six Russian mer
chantmen lying in the harbor." As the
Japanese failed to attack Dalny, the
Russians at once mined the approach,
the haste with which the work was
â¢performed being the cause, of the blow
ing up of the Yenisei. Many ofr- the
mines were badly laid, bo that the
protected cruiser Boyarin struck one
of them during a storm. Â¦ Tho corre
spondent says the Boyarin was not
sunk immediately. Her captain suc
ceeded in placing a collision mat In
position so that the Boyarin was beach
ed. The Boyarin has since been taken
to Port Arthur, where she has been re
paired, the correspondent says.
A Port Arthur correspondent writes
that repairs to the battleship Retvlzan
and the protected cruiser Pallada have
now been completed, the battleship
Cesarevitch being the only remaining
lame ship in the squadron.

is off the main hall. Harrison had been
drinking and a disturbance was raised
at. once, the roomers' declaring they
had paid their rent and would force

Stevens went to the passageway lead

young men. He told them they could
not have the room until they had paid
him 60 cents for a pitcher broken in

of the men thereupon struck Stevens
with his fist and a second man, said
to be Smith, showered a rain of blows
on Stevens' face.

was working south through Richmond,
Nashville, Memphis or any of the great
centers of electrical control on either
side of the Alleghenies so far as beyond

gence from the South was keenly felt
in commercial circles on account of the
critical situation in the cotton trade,
as a result of the semi-panicky condi
tions growing out of the sensational
Government report yesterday on crop

PORTLAND, Ind.. March 26.â Two
men were drowned here to-day and a>
boy was drowned at Huntlngton as
the result of the flood. The loss here
will reach $100,000.
The body found In the trunk is that
of a young, well -formed woman, only
partly dressed. The police theory is
that Crossman, while she was undress-
Ing, struck her from behind with an
ax. severing a portion of the skull,
X>art of which is now missing.
At the time of his suicide Crossman
had five known wives living and sev
eral children. The discovery occurred
through the suspicions of a lodger to
Â¦j\ hom -Crossman let some rooms. For
several weeks the lodger had noticed
an obnoxious odor and complained of it,
but Crossman attributed it to the
drains. At the came time Crossman
was living with one of his wives In the
came room where the body of wife No.
8. was concealed In a trunk. The lodger
traced the odor thereto and Crossman
agreed to take the trunk away. During
the evening of March 23, while moving
the trunk, the lodger's suspicions were
further Increased, and when he saw a
black fluid ooze out of the trunk he
went to a police station. Just as the
grewsome load waa lifted into a cart
the police appeared. With a cry. Cross
man started to run. For three-quarters
of a mile he fled for his life. The po
lice grained on him, and Just as the fore
most of his pursuers was on his heels
Grossman drew from his pocket a razor
and cut his throat from ear to ear.
J}eath was almost instantaneous.
Crossman found his eighth wife in
the young daughter of a London rail
way employe, and she is supposed to
be the victim he incased in cement.
Once free, he set to work to marry
by wholesale. Wife No. 4 was quickly
Becured. She and her baby recently
were living at Crossman's house at
JienEalrys.
'At Heading Crossman secured a fifth
wife under the name of Seaton. A
month later he married again. The
whereabouts and fate of his sixth wife
Hie still uncertain. Having three wives
li\ing at different places, Crossman
took a fourth wife, making a total of
eeven. up to that time. For a year he
kopt up th? deception, and apparently
r.one of his wives had the faintest sus
picion of his polygamous living.'
VICTIJI IN TIIK CEMENT.
Though only TO years old, Cross
man'E career rivals that of famous
rriminals. Under various aliases he
led a double and even a triple
married life. He was an engin
eer, composer, wlgmaker and
bookmaker. His chief means of sup
port, however, appear to have been de
rived from his wives, several of whom
he- -seemed through advertisements.
In 1S3S Crofsman was sentenced to
five years' Imprisonment for bigamy,
nnd when he killed himself he was still
on parole. Yet his neighbors always
regarded him as a respectable man,
Â¦who led a quiet and uninteresting life.
Crossman's first wife died, apparent
ly; of natural causes, in 1897. He re
named in 1S97 at Maidstone. and the
same year created a bigramous mar
riage at Aldon. with the result that
ho was sentenced to five years in penal
servitude. Good conduct in prison en
abled him to avoid the full term.
LONDOX, March 26.â Polygamy and
Its Influence over George Crossman,
'ti-ho had eight or more wives, and the
developments following from the sul
cid* of CroEsman are absorbing public
attention.
On the night of March 23 Crossman,
Tvho was living In the respectable su
burb of Kensalrys, killed himself to
avoid arrest by the police, whose sus-"
picions had been aroused regarding the
contents of a trunk which Crossman
v as sending away from his house.
On opening the trunk the body of a
â¢Voman was found incased in cement.
An investigation proved that she was
murdered abmit six months ago and
that she was one of Crossman's wives.
Â¦ F^ve of his wives were traced and
found alive. One wife is dead and two
are missing. The body found cemented
Is in a decomposed condition even to
the skull, which had been split with
fcn as.
The police believe it possible the in
vestigation may prove that Crossman
adapted a similar method in ridding
himself of other superfluous wives, of
Mhich it is suspected he may' have
had several who have not yet been
traced.

Comfortable, Well Equipped Coaches
and Dining Cars That Rim Over
Sixty Miles an Hour.
A 200-mile road is in operation be
tween Columbus, jOhio, and Indianap
olis, equipped with sleeping: and dining
cars of the most advanced, type. Ex
tensions of this line are being pushed
through to Wheeling, W. Va., and to
Pittsburgh and plans are being made
for connections with Cincinnati. This
service In another year will cover
stretches in various directions of from
200 to 500 miles in |ength. Solid trains
are run, consisting of sleepers, dining
cars and day coaches, all of the most
improved design and construction, the
sleepers costing over $20,000 each. State
rooms with two berths are used instead
j of open compartments. The roadbeds
I and tracks are built as substantially
| as on steam roads, and a speed of
] sixty-five miles an hour is regularly
made on some stretches. Indeed, the
; Chicago, Elgin and Aurora Railroad is
planning an equipment capable of 10U
miles an hour for everyday schedule.
Trains leave the Indianapolis and Co
lumbus terminals at 1:30 o'clock every
night Jnd finish the 200-mile run at G
o'clock on the morning. The operation
of the road has shown that there is no
smoke, cinders or dust, and that sleep
ing car passengers will be able to open
their windows in summer. The charge
for a berth and fare between the two
cities is $5, which is less than the day
coach fare on the competing steam
railroads. Although in the Eastern
States the development of the electric
railway has not yet- reached a stage
where sleepers and dining cars are In
use. still the improvements in the
equipment and fittings of the ordinary
service cars are keeping pace with
those of lines in other parts of the
country. The . Fonda, Johnstown and
Gloversville Railway has put on new
palace cars, which are. said to be the
largest and most expensive ever seen.
They are fifty-five feet in length and
Â¦weigh forty-three tons. High back re- !
versible â¢ seats, finished in plush, with j
roll headrests and footrests, increase I
the comfort of the passenger. Each
car seats fifty-six persons. Over each
seat is an electric light, arid the electric
push button' keeps the passenger in
close touch with the conductor. A tele
phone connects both platforms, so that
the motonnan and conductor can talk
with each other and also with the gen
eral offices of the company.' The cars
are geared to forty-five miles an hour.

who* "will .combine that gracefulness, of
manner and intelligent interest in the
fair desired in men doing this kind of
work." But the concessionaire would
do more wisely, we think, to attempt to
engage his pushers, so far as possible,
from the athletic ranks of the univer
sities. St. Louis is a warm town, and
strength and endurance will probably
be found more necessary than "grace
fulness of manner." And so far as "in
telligent interest is concerned," the at
titude of the average college student
toward art and. kindred subjects is too
likely to be that of the American young
woman who upon seeing the Venus de

Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode

was in New York recently and stopped
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel for several

an elderly woman stopped him near
the hotel and said:
'â¢'Please, sir, will you tell me the way
to. Harlem?" "-'Â«;Â¦
"Harlem!" exclaimed the Senator.
Why, my good woman, you are about
two miles from there, and I should ad
vise you to take a cab."
"Is it as far as that?"- Inquired the
woman. "Then I'll have to walk," and
she sighed heavily as she drew her
shawl more tightly over her shoulders.
The Senator's heart was touched.
"Let me assist you, madam," he said.
"Here are two dollars."
"God bless. you, sir," said the woman,
fervently.
Two nights later the Senator again
was stopped near the hotel by. the same
woman.
"Please, sir, can you tell me the way
to Harlem?" she asked.
"Good Lord, woman, haven't you got
to Harlem yet?" he replied as he

of Russia on the shores of the Pacific

Admiral JIakaroff for the direction of

criticize the advice of Sir Robert Hart,
the Inspector General of Chinese Cus
tome to China, counseling the strength

cunningly seeking to encourage China
with a semi-organized .army to inter

"The erection of a statue in memory
of the tyrant Napoleon means nothing:
less than the triumph of the enemies of
lIberty.'V V- Â¦ . -.
The burden of the editorial Is that
America, has been inoculated with the
virus of "Napoleonlsm." The writer
goes on to say that it is quite apparent
that Americans have not had their fill
of monarchs and that some of them are
aching for a chance to set up a' throne
and crown a King.
This spirit of aristocracy Is attributed
to the intoxication of conquest and an
Insatiable thirst for other worlds^ to
conquer. The writer then registers a
solemn warning to all Americans to
turn back before It is too late to remedy
the evil.
The editorial declares that a statue
to Napoleon In the public park of any
town in America would be an insult to
every republic In the world and odious
to every believer in national liberty as
opposed to despotism. The writer
warns, the people of the United States
against, "the poison of Napoleonism."
"France Is still suffering from the
victories, defeats and national ruin
wrought by Napoleon," he continues.
"Americans can only be counseled to
regard as enemies of their country alt
those who aim to glorify arms and con
quests. It can only nrean ultimate
bloodshed and national decadence.
PARIS. March 26.â The Rappel, a
French Radical organ, has taken note
of a recent announcement In a New
York newspaper that some American
city Is making plans for the erecting
of a statue of Napoleon. A long edi
torial is devoted to what Is termed the
evident decadence of the true spirit of
democracy on the other side of the At

Part of the boat's equipment consists
of a lot of new life belts. These have
just been invented and the initial ex
periments have proved them to be vast
ly superior to the oldtlme life belts,
made of sections of cork sewed in can
vas bags. The new belt consists of a
broad sash in which there are four air
tight pockets. It has been tested sev
eral times In the last month and In
every case has given the best results.
Men wearing the belts jumped into
the water head first, but â¢ Invariably
came to the surface head at the top
and remained thus without the least

the buoyancy of the new belt is suffi

PARIS, March 26.â The first motor

in which petroleum is used for fuel, and
in an ordinary sea is credited with a
speed of twenty-five miles an hour.

will keep it afloat in the heaviest seas.

the temporary activity of the stocks.
The bond market was generally ir
regular.
United States. 2's. old 4's and new
4's registered advanced % and new 4's
coupon % per cent on call during the
week.
The transactions on Tuesday of
more than 400,000 shares of Union Pa
cific at an advance of more than 8
points was an Incident- which finds
few parallels in the history of the
Stock Exchange. The favorite hypo
thesis by Wall street was that North
ern Pacific and Great Northern inter
ests were securing a sufficient holding
in Union Pacific to secure an advan
tage proportionate to Union Pacific
influence in these two companies and
was doing this with the assent of the
controlling interests in Union Pacific
with a view to interchange of director
ships in the various companies and
establishment thus of a community of
interst which would effect the same
results in another way than the se
curities holding company. The large
supply of Union Pacific stocks brought
out from sources associated with the
company during the activity of tlfe
week was accepted by the bull party
as corroboration of this view. On the
other hand official denials were made
of any such plan or of any buying of
Union Pacific by Northern Pacific and
Great Northern interests. The tem
porary activity in the market was
largely congested in stocks wliich were
supposed to be available for the com
munity of interests under the new
plan. The mass of stocks showed lit
tle effect and. their comparative inter
ests checked the movement.
PRICE OF WHEAT ADVANCES.
The laggard movement in United
States Steel, in view of the encourag
ing reports of revived activity in the
iron and steel trade, was especially
notable, although the reports from
that trade had a cheering influence
upon the general sentiment. So did
the rains in the Southwestern wheat
belt. This influence was somewhat
modified by the advance in prices' of
wheat. Prospects for railroad earn
ings were reported better. Foreign
exchange advanced to the gold ex
port point, but the continued inflow of
Japanese gold is an off3et. Money
rates have fallen and in time loan's
are at a point^-.vhich encourages hold
ing of dividend paying railroad stocks
at present prices.

NEW YORK, March M.â To-day's
Â¦took market was a small affair and
trading centered again In Union Pa

range of slightly more than a point
above last night's level, with constant
reactions, and ended the day with an
advance of %. The suggestion that
the- manner Kit distributing the North
ern Securities assets should be submit
ted to Judicial decision had an unset
tling influence upon the market In spite
of the various assurances and intima
tions from authorized sources that
there was no danger of hostilities be
tween the great forces concerned in the
settlement. Some .excitement was
caused all through tire Stock Exchange
neighborhood owing to a dangerous fire
near at hand on Broadway. The smoke
pervaded the halls and offices of the
great buildings surrounding it. Atten
tion was thus diverted and the trad
ing was languid. A reaction before the
bank statement carried prices back to
the neighborhood of last night's level
and there was an Indifferent rally after
its publication. The closing was dull
: and heavy. Total sales of bonds,
; $600,000.
The plan for the distribution of the
Northern Securities holdings of North
ern Pacific and Great Northern was
the occasion of an excited speculation
on two days of the week. The anima
tion and strength of the market in
these two days was almost as great
as on the days when the plan of the
Northern Securities organization began
to emerge into public knowledge. These
effects from the dissolution of a cor
poration from which such great results
were entertained . and whose formula
tion had stimulated such an abundant
rise in values occasioned some perplex
ity which has not been relieved by
anything thus far coming to the public
knowledge. -

A few definitions of Chinese geo
graphical prefixes and sumxes may be
of service in elucidating the nomen
clature of current . war news. First,
prefixes: Ta- as ,ln.Taku,;meap3 great,
and siao.as in Siao-Plng-Thou*. means
small. Pel or pe, nan, tung, and si are,
respectively,- north, south, east and
west. Thus the Pei-Ho is the North
River, etc. ' Shang and hal are upper
and lower". Pai, hei and whang are
white, black and yellow. Suffixes are
more numerous and familiar. Kiang,
ho, tchuan, ula, muren and tchu each
and all mean simply river. Thus
Yalo Kiang and, Liao Ho are
simply' Talu River and Llao River.
Shul, kou, thsuan, khi, gol and
ussu are unfamiliar terms, mean
ing a brook or small river. Hu, nor
and omo mean lake, as In the well
known Lob Nor and Kossa Gol. Po, tse
and tlen mean a small lake or swamp,
or a town situated near such a place.
Hai means sea;. thus Whang- Hal is the
yellow sea, Tung- Hal, is the Eastern
sea, and Nan-Hal Is the Southern sea.
Tao, and sometimes shan, means Is
land, but shan more often means a
mountain range. Ling is a pass over a
mountain range.â Boston Transcript.

Taking it all around, the House of
Commons Is the/best, dressed. assembly
in the world. It has an air of good
breeding, of men accustomed to draw
ing-rooms and good society. The gen
eral deportment comes up to a fairly
high average. You see honorable mem
bers wearing their hats in : the house
and the sight offends; but that is not
a point of manners, but a custom with
a picturesque history at the back of
it. You sometimes, too, see honorable
members asleep, and you often hear
unmanly Interruptions from the Irish
and Tory branches. On the other hand,
you never see an English M. P., as .1
have often seen ,an American Con
gressman, enjoying the' luxury of a
"dry smoke" and relieving himself by
profuse spitting. The House, too,; is
much more punctilious Congress
on the small points of "order, j When
ever a member violates them. he is in
stantly hauled' up, not merely by the
Speaker, but by his .fellow members,
to many of whom it is part of the spice
of life to pounce upon offenders. As
for the oratorical : standard of the
House it is difficult to speak with pre
cision. The late Empress of Austria
used to say that she saw more good
and more bad riding ln the English
shires than anywhere else in the world.
Much the same sort of criticism might
be passed on parliamentary eloquence.
Some of It is exceedingly good, better,
I think, than anything one is likely
to hear in Congress; but much of it is
atrocious. On the whole, in this, as
in so many, other spheres of Anglo-
American comparatives, I should be in
clined* to say that while the House of
Commons' best is better than the Con
gressional best, the House of Commons'
average is below the Congressional av
erage.âHarper's Weekly. ;

Two test actions brought by share

large holdings were said to have been
acquired in the London and Globe and
its ancillary companies, the profits
whereon were more than sufficient to
pay a dividend of 10 per cent on the
current year. The company failed a
year after the prospectus was iBsued

.The Association for the Improve

to the Board of Supervisors calling the
attention of that body to the. fact that
the suit involving the validity of the
trust of the late Adolph Sutro will come
up in Judg-e CofTey'e department of the

weeks. The association is desirous of
proving the validity, of the trust, for
the city will therefore be in a position
to acquire the valuable Sutro property.

addressed to the Supervisors:
To the Honorable the Board of Pupervtsors

OeAliemai: We desire to call your attention
tÂ« l\tr- fact that in a few weeks a case involv

of the late Adolph Sutro. former Mayor of San

of- the sale o- ihe Sutro Heights and the San

fices, frum time to time, were to continue as
Bjrh trustees.

to be invalid, but It is now contended by one

Some sensitive essayist should take
the smell of place as subject. Paris."
for example, is lightly pervaded with;
the odor of burning charcoal and com
ing fron*5ParIs to London one is as-,
sailed By ''the" appeal of soot. Cologne
has a reputation; .long undeserved, for
smells ' other than that of its famous
"water,"-'; and it has-been said that, in
years of old a blind man could find Ma
way. about 1 Cologne . by following his
nose. Moscow has an odd perfume of
its own.. It suggests cranberries of pe
culiar pungency. And it* never leaves
the nose.
Garlic, of course, is the basic smell
that greets the stranger \vho lands at
Calais. But the most curious of the
smells of place is that of St. Peters
burg. The present writer had often
wondered what It was, having detected
it even between the sheets of his bed
at the most exorbitant hotel. On his
third visit he was driving In a droshky
from' the station with a fresh young
English' girl, who had never been away
from Kent before. "Now, do you smell
anything?'' he asked.. "Yes." said the
girl. "Old boots." That is. the smell
of St. Petersburg. Centenarian shoe,

By the provisions of the trust the city Is
made a preferred purchaser of the Sutro
Heights; that is to say, when the property is
offered for rale the city can purchase for 20
per cent lees than the amount of any other
bid. The testator evidently intended that the
city should thus be given an opportunity to
own and preserve as public grounds the splen
did property which he had laid out, known as
Sutro Heights, and his plan, serving a double
purpose provided that the proceeds of the sale
be applied to carrying out his charitable be
quests, concerning which his trustees were
given a wide discretion.

A number of minor bills were passed
by unanimous consent, and special or
ders were made for the consideration
of pension bills, which had the right of
way to-day. After the sundry civil bill
has been disposed of the omnibus bill
will follow pensions as a special order.
The Senate was in session only about
three hours to-day. During that time a
number of private pension bills were
passed and another portion of the Dis
trict of Columbia appropriation bill was
read and debated.
Benton complimented the Republicans
on the bill, saying that it was altogeth
er the best Republican bill he had seen
come from the committee in years. It,
however, did not meet with his ap
proval from a Democratic standpoint.
This estimate, Hemenway said, con
templated all reasonable additions that
might be made by the Senate to the
several appropriation bills, . and was
alBo sufficient to cover all legitimate
deficiencies that might be provided for
the next session.
WASHINGTON,.; March 26.â The
House to-day; 'began consideration . of
the sundry civil apropriatlon! bill. .Ten
hours were fixed <Â¦ for general debate on
the measure, but at the end of an .hour
and a half there were no Â¦ speakers
ready to continue, and the House ad
journed for lack of talkers. -â¢ . â¢ ' : ] : Â¦ -
In his statement on the t.blll. Chair
man Hemenway of the Appropriations
Committee and Benton (D.) flled state
ments on the bill.' Hemenway summed
up the fiscal conditions 'for .the next
fiscal year, showing that after all legiti
mate expenses -had been paid- there
would be $22,000,000 surplus for the year.
Hemenway estimated the annual ex
penditure for 1905 to be $597,802,324; to
this sum must be added the interest on
the public debt, estimated at $84,971,820.
The revenues for the year, he said, were
estimated at $704,472,060; The total esti
mates of the departments, for the ex
penses of the Government, for 1905 ag
gregated $747,317,922, or an excess of
$42,825,862 over the revenues. By scaling
down the estimates and omitting to
pass river and harbor and public build
ing appropriation bills the expenditures
had .been reduced $22,000,000 less than
the estimated revenues. . . . . .,-

PARUAMEyrSXFAV.RCLES
Sx PROVING UNPOPULAR
After the benedictic-n by the Bishop
resolutions of thanks for the use of
the Chamber of Commerce rooms and
the valuable assistance of those who
made addresses were unanimously
adopted.
In concluding he said: "By a curious
coincidence when we exercise tha great
est gift of citizenship, we have in the
modern ballot â the cross â a symbol of
the true Christian voter." He then
dwelt briefly upon the great work of
the Brotherhood of St. Andrew, and
declared that pursuant to their high
Ideals when we (*.Â« mark our ballot it
Is with a cross of St. Andrew.
Bishop Nichols then paid a tribute to
William and Mary College, and de
clared that It did more to breed the
plants of this republic than any other
Influence. He called attention to the
fact that three Presidents graduated
from the institution and a number of
statesmen had been sent forth from it.
"Typified in that old Jamestown
church." said the Bishop, "upon the
first ballot of the Burgesses are all the
etars and all the stripes that have since
been unfurled." ,
He next discussed the relation of the
church to the state in history, and
declared that we have the warnings of
centuries to tell of the disastrous re
eults when the church tries to run the
etate or the state endeavors to crush
out the church. Bishop Nichols sum
med up the addresses of the other
speakers during the week.' He said
that it was the province of the church
to train man's conscience so that when
he voted he did so with a feeling of the
responsibility.
With the address of Right Rev. Wil
liam Ford Nichols. Bishop of Califor
nia, the noon Lenten services which
have been given during the last week
In â¢ the resins of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce ended yester
day. â¢
The subject of "Righteous Citizen
ehjp in the Church" was left for the
last day, and'Btehop Xichols consented
to deliver the address, j The services
yesterday were led by H. R. Braden
and the lesson was taken from St.
Matthew, chapter 22, verses 15 to 22.
After the usual devotional exercises
Bishop Xichols was introduced. He
opened by saying that American cit
izenship began within the four walls
of the church. He told of the meeting
of the House of Burgesses in James
town, Va., on July. 30, 161S, the first
legislative body in America, when the
first American ballot was cast. He
dwelt upon the fact that as these
eturdy pioneers gathered in the "meet
ing house" for their first session it can
be regarded that the first election booth
was the church at God.

V.'HO EPOKE YESTERDAY AT
N'OOKDAY IXN'TtN SERVICES.
At the election in Company F, Fifth
Infantry, located in Oakland, Major G.
K." Wethern of the Second Brigade staff
was -elected captain, a position he has
held before, and C. C. Covalt was elect
ed second lieutenant. .Captain Wethern
entered the National Guard by enlist
ment as a private in Company F of the
Fifth, was promoted corporal, sergeant
and second lieutenant and was then
elected captain, and after being in that
position for several terms retired' and
was appointed on the Second Brigade
staff with the rank of major. The
members of his old company were so
anxious to have him as their comman
der once moTe that they prevailed upon
him to a^ain lead them.' Covalt has
been a lieutenant of the company
Bince 1899.
If the weather to-day permits bat
teries C and D of the First Artillery
battalion will proceed to the tree cov
ered ground in the vicinity of Ingle
tide for a practice march and for field
maneuvers. It is proposed to give the
men of this organization practical ex
perience instead of confining them to
"fours right and fours left" in the
armory. This and the practice with the
guns at the Presidio will give them a
better idea of what is expected of the
soldier than all the the'oretical instruc
tions that can be imparted to them
within the four walls of the drill hall.
Company B, First Infantry, will give
an entertainment and dance In the reg
imental armory on April 18.
Elections have been ordered as fol
lows: Company C. First Infantry, for
captain, March 28; Troop A, cavalry,
for captain, vice Jensen, term expired,
April 11: Company H, First Infantry,
for captain, April 13; f:,'
TO DRILL. IX FIELD.
Both Inspectors closely watched the
maneuvers, and the expression on the
face of Major Wilhelm. though he said
not a word, was clearly expressive of
what opinion he was forming when
the company executed movements.
Each inspector will present his indi
vidual report to the department he
represents, and there is considerable
guessing as to whether the two will
agree. One of these reports will go to
the War Department at Washington,
D. C, and the other to me commander
in chief of the State of California's
guard.
One thing that militated against the
appearance of the men at Inspection
was the lack of Â£elts and the absence
of bayonets In the drill. The men have
not yet been furnished with the regu
lation belts, consequently did not make
the Â¦ good showing from the ' point of
military appearance they would have
mado, and by reason of the absence
of such could not have bayonets. That
being the cape, they were obliged to
go through the very Important ma
neuver known as "the bayonet drill"
without what in the guard is generally
denominated "toad-stickers," making
that part of the drill quite tame, as
"thrust" without bayonets on the
pieces In "the hapds of. the. men is about
as satisfactory as washing the hands
with invisible soap in imaginary water.-
J. "W. F.rwin will deliver an illustrat
ed lecture on the evening of April
6 in the EUis-street artnory before the
First Battalion of Artillery. The sub
ject will be "Honolulu." Invitations
may be had from members of the bat
talion. * - . . "-
ARE WITHOUT BELTS.
The announcement In this column last
week that the board specially detailed
for the purrose of preparing- a new
military bill for the National Guard of
the State, to conform as near as possi
ble, to the 'provisions -of &e Dick bill
that was passed by Congress, had sent
out n request for suggestions from the
officers of the guard, has struck many
of these as a most singular procedure.
They are of the opinion that it would
have been wiser for the board to have
prepared a bill according to its- own
ideas and then sent a copy of the same
to each officer and invite criticism and
I Suggestions. They claim that if such a
method is adopted a much better bill
can be framed, for then the officers will
have an opportunity to suggest that
which ought to be omitted and declare
that which ought to be added.
The inspections in the First Infantry
commenced in the regimental armory,
at Page and Gough streets, last Mon
day and were continued during the
week. They will conclude this week.
The company that made the best show
ing was B. 'Captain Kelly. Every man
of the company responded "present" at
muster and the inspection was a most
satisfactory one, the inspecting officers.
Major Wllhelm, U. S. A., and Colonel
Koster, State inspector, finding but lit
tle to enter on the page of adverse crit
icism in the note books. Some of the
companies that were inspected last
week did not come up to the standard
of Company B, being shy as to num
bers and somewhat behind in move
ments and in the execution of orders.
At the inspection of Company F on
Friday night some of the formations
were crooked and there was much de
lay In the execution of such movements
as "fours right into line" and in "rally
bv fours," some of the men running
from one point of rally to the other
without apparently knowing at which
point they should rally. In the setting
up exercises the instructor frequently
had to call out, "Don't you know your
right from your left?" "Keep those
heels together," and so on, which
proved that the men had not paid the
attention that they should have to the
simple movements of the exercise.

SALES IX DETAIL
The present leading feature connected
with the realty of San Francisco is.
plainly the home building that is in
progress. The increase in the value of.
business properties is an old theme.
Income properties are solid, but the
owners do not care to sell them. The
general market conditions have stead
ily tended to give confidence to those j
that wish to have homes and who seek (
mainly to so place their money that in
the long run they will come out more j
than even by the appreciation in land i
value when the improvements may be- !
come somewhat out of date. ,
No part of the city where front foot J
prices are low enough to permit the j
careful buyer to secure a home site I
falls to improve. The large unimproved
areas in sections near Golden Gate i
Park, north and south of the great I
pleasure ground, now on the market :
make a conspicuous showing in the i
matter of new work that is under way. j
Richmond and the Sunset district con- j
tlcue to Improve quite rapidly.
Those that have lots in the sections j
mentioned have recently been selling ;
them at prices that net a handsome j
profit above the original cost. The !
buildings in the newer portions of the !
city axe of a good class,* generally I
speaking. While there have been very '
large deals in San Francisco realty dur- j
Ing the last week, there has been good i
Inquiry for home sites at reasonable j
prices. When the weather is again set- I
tied the building of homes will proceed j
more rapidly than has been advan- !
tageous within the last fortnight.
There Is something of a stir among '.
the flfty-vara holdings. The Spring â¢
Valley Water Company has authorized j
Baldwin & Howell to offer at private
Bale several parcels of their holdings, '
some of which are located in a neigh
borhood that has commanded consid- i
erable attention for some time past i
owing to the unsurpassed marine view
to be had from the property. Among
the properties to be placed on the mar
ket are a flfty-vara lot at the northeast
coner of Larkin and Lombard streets,
the flfty-vara lot at the southwest cor
ner of Larkin and Chestnut streets, the
flfty-vara lot at the northeast corner of
Polk and Chestnut streets, the flfty
vara lot at the southeast corner of
Francisco and Polk streets, the flfty
vara lot on the north line of Chestnut
street, 137:6 feet east of Polk, and an
entire block in th* Potrero. known as
Potrero block No. Co, bounded by Six
teenth, Seventeenth arid Hampshire
streets and Potrero avenue.

AX ABSOLUTE XECRSSITY.
So Thinks at Least One Traveling
Man.
I would as soon think of starting
out without my mileage books and grip
as to start out on a trip without a box
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets in my
valise, said a traveling man who repre-
sents a St. Louis hardware house.
Why? Because I have to put up at
all kinds of hotels and boarding-
houses. I have to eat good, bad and
indifferent food at all hours of the day
and night and I don't believe any
man's stomach will stand that sort of
thing without protest, any way I know
mine won't. It has to have some-
thins to break the fall and Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets is the crutch I fall
back on.
My friends often "Josh" me about
it, tell me I'm an easy mark for pilÂ»nt
medicine fakers, that advertised medi-
cines are humbugs, etc., but I notice
that they are nearly always complain-
ing of their aches and pains and poor
digestion, while I can stand most any
old kind of fare and feel good and
ready for my work when it needs me.
and I believe I owe my good digestion
and sound health to the daily, regular
use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets; year
in and year out, and all the "joshing"
tn the world will never convince me
to the contrary.
I used >to have heartburn about
three times a day ane* a . headache
ibout three or four times a week and
ifter standing for this for four or five
pears I began to look around' for a
crutch and found it when my doctor
told me the best investment I 'could
make would be a 50 cent box of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, and I have
Invested about 50 cents a month . for
them ever since and when I stop to
think that that is what I spend every
lay for cigars, I feel like shaking
hands with myself, for I can keep my
stomach and digestion In first-class ?or-
ier for 50 cents a month. I don't care'
Cor any better life insurance.
My druggist tells me they are the
most popular o*' all stomach medi-
cines and that they have maintained
their popularity. and success because
they do as advertised. They bring re-
sults, and results are what count in
patent medicine as much as in selling

A decided innovation has been mada
by the management of the St. Francis
Hotel in San Francisco. This con
sists in opening a library of 4000 vol
umes for the use of the guests of the
house. The room occupied by the
library is on' the lower floor, looking
out on the park and is tastefully or
namented and richly furnished.
The books, many of them in costly
binding, are chiefly of standard fiction,
poetry, essays and history. Current
fiction and magazines will be supplied.
There will also be a section devoted to
the literature of the Pacific Coast, Hvea
of its pioneers, all obtainable works on
the missions of California, everything
in fact which will illustrate the history
and development of this region. Mrs.
Helen A. Laughton, recently from Bos

The offer made by Mr. Carnegie in
1900 of $750,000 to San Francisco was
declined, as this city prefers to. erect
Its own library building, and has voted
bonds for this purpose and for the pur
chase of a site.
In Seattle, Wash., recent evidence Is
given of the appreciation in which the
public library of that city' is held by
local educators by a letter sent to the
Bo'ard of Library Trustees. It was
signed by the Superintendent of
Schools, F. B. Cooper, and two of the
school principals in behalf of the twen
ty-seven principals of Seattle. It reads
as follows:
The superintendent, principals and teachers
of the public. schools of the city, realizing the
si-cat benefits that must accrue to the pupils

that which places within the reach of
all the treasures of the world which
are stored up in books."
California has been remembered by
Mr. Carnegie in a bountiful manner."
He has made in this State, prior to
March 1, 1904, when he sailed for Eu
rope, twenty-nine gifts for libraries,
aggregating $557,500.
The average sum presented to these
twenty-nine places is $19,224. Of the
total amount there has been allotted
to Los Gatos, Visalla, Palo Alto, San
Luis Obispo, Woodland, Benicia, Red
ding, Watsonville, Chico, Redwood
City, Nevada City and Haywards,
$10,000 each; to Petaluma, Santa
Monica and Hanford, $12,500 each; to
Pomona, San Bernardino and Santa
Ana, $15,000 each; to Eureka, River
side, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and Val
lejo, $20,000 each; to Fresno, $30,000;
to Alameda. $35,000; to Berkeley, $40,
000; to Oakland, San Diego and San
Jose, $50,000 each.
The recent offer of a library donation
to Scarborough, England, reveals the
fact that this is the thousandth library
gift made by Andrew Carnegie. His
first gift was made to Braddock, Pa.,
in 1SS9. ';/.'-:

library purposes and are not included
In the above mentioned estimate are:
Peter Cooper Union, New York, $500,000;
Birmingham, England, university en
dowment, $250,000; Booker Washington's
Tuskegee Institute, $600,000; pension

gie Institute, Washington, $10,000,000;
The Hague Temple of Peace, $1,500,000;
engineering building, New York, $1,500,
000. Besides a considerable number of
millions for endowments of the pros
pective Pittsburg Technical Institute,
designed to be unsurpassed in the
world, have been donated.
The aggregate amount of Mr. Car
negie's gifts of all descriptions for
public benefits throughout the world
is believed by those who are well in
formed to be now between $90,000,
000 and $100,000,000.
From an address given by Mr. Car
negie at the dedication of the library
at Braddocl:, Pa., it may be seen why
he chooses to bestow such amounts
upon free public libraries. . He then
said: "It is from personal experience
that I feel that there is no human ar
rangement so powerful for good; there
is no benefit that can be be
stowed on a community so great as
It is worthy of remark that while ay
plications from cities for library aid
are filed for investigation by the office
secretaries, when library buildings are
burned all formalities are omitted and
offers of help to the cities are tele
graphed. Seattle,. Wash., . Lincoln,
Nebr.. St. Cloud. Minn., and Marl
borough, Mass., have In their sudden
need through .destruction of their
libraries found in Mr. Carnegie a help
ins friend.
Some other notable benefactions of
Mr. Carnegie â though this is not a com
plete listâ^Yhich were not bestowed for
CARXE^IE'S REASONS.
The total amount of library dona
tions to other countries than the United
States was estimated to be, prior to
June 1. 1903, 55,861,000. The aggregate
sum given for library uses in the Unit
ed States to the same date is placed
at $38,505,000. No figures are now ob
tainable for donations, made during the
last nine months, but' it is safe to say
that the total sum of all library gifts
thus far bestowed to all the countries
previously mentioned will hardly fall
short of $50,000,000. The smallest gift
reported is $500; the largest one is that
made to Xew York City for establish
ing sixty-five branch libraries, $5,200,000.
Though Mr. Carnegie' is recognized as
the champion library giver his bestow
ments have not been confined to this
specialty. Some years ago he had a
hobby of church organ giving and
many churches in England and Scat
land received offerings of this descrip
tion. Of late he has given freely for
endowments of colleges and other In
stitutions of learning. Apparently not
a dollar is 'bestowed for objects of dis
play; the benefactions are distinctly
for uplifting educational purposes.
Newfoundland. Canada, Cuba, Porto
Rico, New Zealand, New South Wales
England, Scotland, Ireland. Wales and
the United States. Every State in the
Union, save Arkansas, Mississippi, and
possibly Delaware and Rhode Island,
has been a recipient through its cities
of a library offer.

At 9:15 o'clock yesterday morning
Mr. Gruenagle was called for break
fast, but declined to go and said he
would remain fn bed and await the
arrival of the doctor. A few seconds
later the report of a firearm was
heard and Gruenagle was found dead
ln bed, with blood flowing from his
temple and a. revolver at his. side.
Mr. Gruenagle was 79 years old and
up to six years ago had been in the
service cf the Southern Pacific Com
pany. Since his dismissal at that time
he had been very despondent, and this,
added to the sickness of his wife, 72
years old, made him an invalid also.
He and his wife were living with their
married daughter and her husband,
H. M. Owens.
George Greunagle committed suicide
yesterday morning at 947 Haye3 street
by shoohng himself in the right temple
with a revolver. Despondency, lead
ing to temporary Insanity, Is assigned
as the cause.

Young Men of Episcopal Church Are
Preparing for Religious Study in ,
Hills Near Gilroy. Â¦
The various chapters of the Brother
hood of St. Andrews, an Episcopal or
ganization of young men connected
with the parishes of cities and towns
in immediate proximity to the bay,
have under consideration the project
of a joint meeting for conference and
religious purposes in some retired spot,
to be held during the latter part of
June.
The place under consideration and
likely to be selected is near the city of
Gilroy. A site has been offered the
camp, on which suitable buildings for
meetings and shelter are available.
No more beautiful location could be
chosen than in the retired groves and
the hillsides which overlook the valley
at this point. The general plan is
something like the camp-meetings that
were held in early Methodist days, but
will take rather the character of a
summer school of religious study and
meditation.
The programme is being prepared
by Tracy R. Kelley, William Harrison,
H. Robert vBradin, George S. Baker,
Newton Barry, J. C. Ashedo and J. R.
Pringle. The sanction of the Bishop
of the diocese has been secured. The
support and co-operation of. the clergy
is enthusiastic.
Killed by a Fall.
John H. Coe, a solicitor, 30 years
old, was found dead at 7 o'clock yes
terday morning at the bottom? of a
flight of stairs leading to 19 Sixth
street. A. C. Dlebner, a bartender in
Sullivan's saloon, informed Deputy
Coroner . Michael Brown that he had
seen Coe fall upon the concrete side
walk at 6 o'clock in the morning and
that he wajs very drunk. . There was
a large lump on Coe's head.

PliAN A BROTHERHOOD
CAMP-MEETING IN JUNE
. Ferdinand , Habcr, the State iViticul
tural 'Commissioner v to the St. Louis
Exposition,'- supplemented the:resolu
tion .with -. a- short exhortation to the
grape growers â¢ to Â¦ aid in I the "; creation

tion ; of California wines. After vot-
: Besides discussing: the. Bell bill the
afternoon session transacted- consid

Bundschu was adopted: â¢ t, Â¦'Â¦
Resolved, That the California Viticultural
Club pledges, Its hearty. and energetic support
to the Joint viticultural exhibit at the expo
sition In St. , Louis,. and ..suggests that even"
viticulturist and -interested' party v should lend
his strongest Â¦ moral and financial aid to make
this California exhibit a demonstrative suc
cess. : "â¢ -. i - Â¦. . Â¦ Â¦" Â¦ ' Â¦ 'Â¦ .-._.Â¦."'."
Influenced by the speeches he had
listened to, Whittemore wanted the
whole matter left to Mr. Bundschu,
but the latter declined to assume the
responsibility. After Voyle's motion
to reconsider had prevailed, the club
decided to refer the resolution to a
committee of five with power .to cor
respond v'th Congressman Bell on the
subject and present the views of the
grape growers. Chairman Swett ap
pointed as the committee Messrs.
Bundschu, Bruck, G. H. Malter of
Fresno, Frank Swett of Martinez and
B. A. Towne of Lodl.
At the morning session the club lis
tened to Interesting practical talks by
Professors Twight and Husmann on
phylloxera and the "Anaheim dis
ease" in grape vines, several of the
members adding., suggestions of value
in the discussions that followed. Chair
man Swett was authorized to appoint
at his leisure a standing committee of
three to consult with the president
and regents of the University . of Cal
ifornia and co-operate in obtaining
an increased legislative appropriation
for the department of viticulture at
the university, where the work in be
i half of the vast grape and wine Indus
try of the State has been greatly ham
pered by the reduction in available
funds. The chairman announced the
following nominations for. the club's
executive .committee,, .which were
unanimously adopted: W. C. Chis
holm,' Windsor, ' Sonoma County; Q.
E.; Lawrence, chairman, of the Sari
! Joaquin County Viticultural Associa
tion; John' T. Dore, Fresno County;
F. H. Duffy, Santa Clara County;
Frank T. Swatt, Contra Costa Coun
ty; Bismarck Bruck, Napa County; A.
W. Glbbs,; Santa Cruz County. .
THE ST.'UOUIS EXHIBIT.
I was a member of the committee of wine
men to whom Congressman Bell came with
the draft of his proposed bill. We went over
every, clause with care, and recognized that
It was almost hopeless to expect its passage.
But we agreed it was an excellent measure.
If for nothing more than aÂ» a declaration of
California principles. Eastern trade Interests
are doing their best to hurt our industry by
identifying California with adulterations. We
thought it well to show that we do not fear
the most strlncent regulation against adul
terations. We can stand it If the East can.
So we told Bell to feel his way and ijee what
could be done. Only a fortnight ago the lead
ing Kastern publication in the wine trade con
.tained a slanderous article purporting to de
scribe how California wines are made. Let
us stand by the bill and contradict such slan
ders. Our exhibit of pure wlnei at St. Louis
will do much to show what California wines
really aic. (Applause.) â¢
Bundschu Wine Company, told what
he knew of the pending bill. He said:
Professor E. H. Twight of Berkeley
also lent a hand in straightening out
Whittemore's misunderstanding of the
bill. Its chief end, he said, was to
stop a practice, more common in the
East than here, but nevertheless al
ready doing harm to California wines.
This was the refermentation of pom
ace. Sugar and water were added
after the grape juice had been pressed
from the pomace. Sometimes this was
repeated two or three times. The pro
duct, which was nothing more than
sugar wash, was colored with chemi
cals. The bill also aims to prevent
the use of antiseptics in wine. "If we
don't want these things in wine,"
Twight declared, "then the passage of
the bill will be the best way to keep
them out-"
After William Maitland of Santa
Cruz County had spoken briefly in fa
vor of the Bell measure, .Charles
Bundschu, president of the Gundlach-
Congressman Bell's bill means what It says.
It wae prepared at St. Helena ln consulta
tion with all the larger grape growers there
abouts. I was - one of those Bell took Into
his confidence and I can say positively that
he consulted no one of the San Francisco wine
men until lone afterward. Neither 7% nor I
knew either Mr. Morgan or Mr. Rossi at that
time. The bll! was drawn, not In the interest 1
of the California Wine Company, but of the
California grape growers, to prevent the use
of anything but grape Juice ln the manufacture
of wine. As to the tax which the bill Im
poses upon all wines, this is so trifling that
every maker of pure wine will be glad to
pay It in order to sacure Government protec
tion from the competition of adulterated goods.
The small wine makers will not have to pay
more than $2 or $3 per annum. The law could
not be enforced without a fund for the pur
pose, but the bulk of the tax will be paid by
the bis wineries. The bill will be a â¢ boon
to all California wine and grape interests.
Whittemore's attack brought Bis
marck Bruck of St. Helena, the author
of the resolution, to his feet in re
ply. He succeeded in smoothing down
the fiery member from Stockton
somewhat, saying among other things:
TRUST NOT FAVORED.
The long-standing conflict of Inter
est between the California grrape
gTowers and the -winemakers repre
sented by the California Wine Associa
tion made Its reappearance, yesterday
afternoon ln the session of the newly
organized California Viticultural Club.
A warm debate was provoked by. the
motion of Joseph Voyle of Alameda to
reconsider the resolutions adopted on
Thursday indorsing: Congressman
Bell's pure wine bill now pending at
Washington. Charles A. Whittemore
of Stockton fiercely attacked the bill,
declaring- it the work of the "wine
trust," and making some insinuations
against members of the club. His ob
jections were fully met, however, by a
number of speakers <and under the
skillful guidance of Chairman John
Swett an amicable disposition of the
matter was made. Whittemore said in
part:
For the first time It hu been proposed to
put t^e wine Droducera under the Jirel of the
tax gatherer, and the proposal is made at the
instance of the large manufacturers. ' The
agents of tho trust go to the small winery
and sav to the proprietor: "You are well-es
tablished. Join with us in shuttlns out these
little fellows. Let us put a tax on all wines.
This will cut off the men who make only a
few thousand gallons of wine, thus restrict
ing the competition and lowering the price
of grapes." Such a scheme wculd be Impos
sible were It not for the Eastern wine makers,
who must a3d sugar ln .their manufacture,
because their crapes are too low ln percent
age of natural euear. They cannot do with
out the sugar; Â«o the trust hopes to Â»cet their'
consent to tlÂ»e tax ln exchancre for permission
to use RUKar. The aim of the bill Id not
what appears on its face, but a compromise by
which the ty-ust will get a tax crushing the
.small wine ntakers as a result of a deal with
the Ka stern 'makers on the eugar question.
I want to say a word about these "Dagoes,"
as the bic fellows call the Italians who are
starting new wineries all over the State.
Without the Italians, the grape growing In
dustry of California would be ln a bad way.
They consume vast Quantities of scrapes and
so raise the wlce to the producer. What If
they do put a little eugar ln their wine?
There Is no harm ln that, and some of the
big California wineries are doing the same
thing. It is not sugar, but drugs, that we
must fight. The wine trust, represented here
yesterday by Percy T. ' Morgan, president of
the California Wine Association; P. C. Kossl of
the Swiss-Italian Colony, and others of the
big wine men. is making over 100 per cent
profit at the present low price for grapes, but
it Is not satisfied with that, and wants to cut
the price of grapes still more. Do not let them
use this small assemblage, called tocether in
formally, to further tbe Interests of the mo
nopoly which they are trying to establish. Re
call your resolution and refer the whole mat
ter to a committee that will fairly represent
the grape and wine Interests of the whole
State.

Few People Know How Useful It Is
In Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize Its value when taken into
the human system for the same
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy, that the more
you take of it the better; It Js not a
drug at, all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
tbe stomach and intestines and carries
tnem out of the systsm.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
&nu>kii:g, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion; it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and. eminently : xf e cathartic.
It absorbs the Injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another,' but probably the
best- charcoal and the most for the
money Is in Stuart's Absorbent Loz-
enges; they are composed of the finest
powdered willow charcoal and other
harmless antissptics in tablet form or
rather in the form of large, pleasant
tasting lozenges, the charcoal being
mixed with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion,, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, > but. on the contrary,
great benefit.
A* Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal says: .-."I ad-
vise Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges to
all patients suffering from . gas in
stomach and bowels and to clear the
complexion and purify ; the breath.

All cities, with few exceptions. -. trace
the origin of their plan to the inclosed
camp, and many still show marked
features of primitive fortifications. In
all early schemes for defense the in
closed square was considered the best.
From the time when wagons were
merely parked on the plain to the time
when buildings were constructed with
blank walls to the enemy and. their
facade to the open square. this plan
has been universally adopted; and
many of the great squares or market
places of famous cities still show un
deniable evidences of these precautions
for defense. In the old city of Brus
sels the square upon which faces its
wonderful City Hall is approached by
streets so narrow that they must sure
ly have been constructed with the idea
of defense in mind.
Were It possible to forecast the rapid
development of cities or to predict
which of our many cities is to become
a metropolis, the problem might not
be such a difficult one,* but such, un
fortunately. Is not the case. Even the
most vivid imagination would scarcely
have been able to predict the enormous
increase of population and the conse
quent architectural development, of
modern " cities. The rapid . growth of
American cities Is well-known, but few
i realize that the older cities of Europe
have had a similar experience. The
recent increase in Berlin has exceeded
that of Chicago, and what is true of
Berlin is true of many, other Euro
pean centers. It is then not surprising
to note that in Hanover, Hamburg,
Nuremberg, Leipslc, Leignltz, St. Jo
hann a Saar 1 and Madgeburg modern
municipal, buildings ;6f great impor
tance have recently been : . or are now
being constructed.â Exchange. Â¦'Â¦ >

HOW PliAXS OP'CITITES
HAD THEIR ORIGIN
LINCOLN. Neb.. March 2G. â TV. J. Bryan
has rone to New Haven, Conn. He came to
Jv'Â«braÂ«=ka several days ago for thÂ« purpose of
fcuending a. political conference at Omaha.
A hard fight was made to get him
oft on the plea of self-defense and had
not Gratziano's 11-year-old son seen
the deed and been able to contradict
the testimony the murderer would
probably have gone free. The jury
stood two for murder in the first
degree and ten for manslaughter. It
held out for thirty hours, but finally
the two gave way and a verdict of
murder in the second degree was
brought in. The maximum penalty for
the crime is life imprisonment.
Luigi Orio, the Italian charged with
the murder of L. Gratziano, was con
victed of manslaughter this evening
by a jury after having been out about
thirty hours. Orio broke down and
created a scene In the courtroom
when the result of the jury's delibera
tion was communicated to him. The
two men had been friends, but quar
reled over money matters. An hour
or two later the same evening they
met again and Orio pulled a pistol and
shot Grataiano.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 26.
A meeting was held last night In
Vanghn & Keith's studio, 110 Geary
street H. G. Vaughn x presided , and
H. Schussler acted as secretary. The
entire frontage on Geary street, from
Kearny to Powell, was represented by
the owners and merchants and they
all agreed to pay their pro rata for
the. improvements. It was decided to
place forty-five arc lights along the
streets, which will make jthe thor
oughfare at night as bright as day.
These lights will burn until 2 o'clock
every morning, two hours after the
usual time for turning off arc lights.
The street Is to be repaved and the
sidewalks reconstructed. Bonnet's
band will give concerts every Satur
day in Union square, if permission can
be obtained from the Board of Su
pervisors. Progress is to be the
watchword of the club and every ef
fort will be put forth to make Geary
street one of the most attractive in
the shopping district.
Fully alive to competition and not
to be outdone by other sections of the
retail district, the progressive mer
chants and property owners who con
stitute the recently organized Geary
street Improvement Club, have deter
mined to take steps to increase their
business by needed improvements to
the street, better lighting facilities and
band concerts in Union square.
Company B, commanded by Captain
Abe Appleton, was the next to- perform
before the steadfast gaze of the judges.
Captain Appleton proved to be a great
leader and executed many movements
that had not been performed ' by his
predecessor. When the company was
dismissed the balcony applauded loudly.
Company C, the last to be called to
assemble, was composed of boys vary
ing from 11 to 13 or 14 years of age,
while the other companies were made
up of boys a little older. Those of the
balcony and even the austere Judges
could not suppress their smiles as the
tiny voices piped In answer to rollcall.
Captain William McLaughlin, how
ever, proved to the spectators that age
has little to do in making soldiers and
that youth is no detriment so far as
drilling is concerned.
After a long drill the small comman
der dismissed his small company and
awaited the decision of the judges. -'It
did not take them -long to decide, and
Colonel Bauer announced the fact that
Company C was victorious.
Colonel Bauer congratulated the re
spective officers for the work they had
achieved in the last year and praised
the men highly for their splendid drill
ing.
Captain George Morse of Company A
was the first to call his men to the
floor. For .fully half an hour he. put
them through the most difficult tac
tics without even having a break oc
cur in the lines. "Â°V Â¦-
The three companies that constitute
the military department of the Colum
bia Park Boys' Club! together with the
brass band, fife and drum and hospital
corps* gave ah exhibition at the Page
street armory last night that would do
credit to. a well trained battalion of
regular infantrymen.
Hundreds of spectators thronged the
gallery and enthusiastically encouraged
the little boys in blue as they skilly
fully performed the most difficult tac
tics of the blue book.
The drill was given for the purpose
of awarding a decision and trophy to
the best drilled company, and army and
navy officers were chosen to decide the
question.
At a little after 8 o'clock the bat
talion, headed by the band and drum
corps, marched up the center of tha
long drill room and took its stand for
inspection. . . .
With their neat blue suits, brass but
tons, white gloves and tan leggins, the
little fellows were a pleasing sight, and'
the approval of the large audience was
manifested by loud and hearty ap
plause.
Lieutenant Colonel Koster, Colonel G.
W. Bauer, C. R. Alberger and several
officers of the Presidio, all in full'dresa
uniform, walked slowly back and forth
between the ranks. â .
At the conclusion of the rigid inspec
tion the officers retreated to the Judges'
stand at the -far end of the hall and
awaited the first company. .

Lucy is a smart young colored
woman who officiates as maid of all
work in a Brooklyn family. She is
much esteemed by her mistress and
the rest of the family and all take a
friendly interest in Lucy and her af
fairs. When on a recent "afternoon
out" she appeared in a complete suit
of mourning . several inquiries were
made with regard to her bereavement,
as she had said nothing about the re
cent death of any relative.
"How long have you been wearing
mourning, Lucy?" asked her mistress.
"Well, 'm, this is just the fust time
Ah's worn this yere suit, and it ain't
egzactly mohnin'."
**Not mourning!" wa3 the reply.
'Unless you were swathed in crape you
couldn't wear much deeper mourn

THE PHILIPPINESâ S., City. It is
asserted that only about one-ninth of
the surface of the Philippine Islands i 3
under cultivation. It has been esti
mated that in view of the fertility of
the soil, even after deducting the
mountainous area, with cultivation ex
tended, the islands can support a dodu
lation of 42.000.000. P PU
A curious Instance of the care and
minuteness with which the human body
is now studied, in the effort better to
understand its powers and functions.
Is furnished by a paper read recently
at a meeting of the Royal Society iu
London 'on the "Rapidity of the Nerv
ous Impulse in Tall and Short Individ
uals." Even the difference in time re
quired for a "nerve telegram" to tra
verse the bodies of different people is
regarded as a matter of scientific im
portance. ~ A series of observations has
shown that the length of the nerve
does affect the velocity with which
an impulse passes between the brain
and the extremities, and consequently
that more time is needed if the path
is long than if it is short. It follows
that a short man should feel a step on
his corns quicker than a tall man, but
the difference is so slight that the of
fender has.no better chance of escape
in one than in the other.

WE regret td note the existence of some doubt;
about the Agricultural Department being able
to secure the fifty acres of land required at
Chico for the proposed agricultural and horticultural ex-:
periment station. This matter should be attended to at
once. The matter, is of too much importance to permit
a failure. * j
The. selection of the Sacramento Valley for such an
important plant slfould impress the people of the Whole
valley. The matter of location was long and carefully
considered. Experts in climate, soils and all the require
ments of such a station made careful and scientific ex
amination. The purpose was to find a location friendly
to the greatest possible variety of useful plant life.
Nothing of greater significance has occurred in the his
tory of that great and splendid valley than its selection
as the spot most favored by nature. How.sordid would
be the outcome if the plan should fail through the greed
or indifference of the people! ;
The. Sacramento Valley Improvement Association can
have no more important business on hand just now than
seeing that there is no failure. The State Board of
Trade would seem to have' a duty in. the premises. Jts
president, General Chipman, is a- large planter in the val
ley. Its leading director, Mr. W. H. Mills, was long and
usefully identified with that fertile region, and surely his
interest has not lapsed.
.The whole State wants this station Â¦;Â¦ where it will do
the most good to agriculture and horticulture. It is a
happy conjunction that the department decides -that it'
should go where.there is most need. of the impulse it/will
pve to cverx interest related to the soil; \\Ve appeal, di-

is a month of verdure and 'outdoor flowers, with no
frozen ground nor zero temperature.
.The contrast between it and the Eastern March is
great. The Eastern people are just getting 'over their
frost bites and chilblains, when the cyclones come along
and complete the cure by killing the patients. From
the gulf States to the lakes, whirling winds are x besom
ing town and country, and lightning is destroying life
and property. It is hard luck to tote wood and coal
all winter to keep from freezing to death, only to be
blown into giblets or struck by lightning in the" spring.
iYet that is the luck of our friends in the East. Those
.who escape now will, in about three months, be exposed
to sunstroke, and in August will be running to cover
chased by mad. dogs.
, March has cut up in California, and acted the bull
in the china shop of our climate. But through it all
the roles have bloomed, the violets have scented the
rude winds and the palms have flaunted their defiant
fronds. Our outdoor gardens have continued their pro
duction'of tender vegetables and the orange trees have
bloomed in the latitude of Chicago, as have the almond3
and cherries. Fresh asparagus as big as ; corn stalks is
in the markets, with-new " potatoes and green peas.
Our minimum temperatures? run from 44 at Cloverdale,
in the northern citrus.belt, to 40 at Los Angeles, in the
southern citrus belt, and from 42 at San Francisco to
48"at San Diegoâ chilly, but not freezing, and the lowest
of the winter.
This State is a jnercy scat for Eastern folk, who
mope" by . a red hot stove all winter and sleep in a
cyclone cellar all summer. v We have neither 'sunstroke'
nor mad dogs, and even tramps enjoy comforts that,
would be called luxuries in the East. Our earthquakes
are' no harder than those : of New England, and as they
are more. frequent we get used to them, and really miss
them when they take a vacation. Our best immigVa

General Kuropatkln's hold over men
Is due to the fact that he has a reputa
tion for absolute fearlessness. Five
years ago h* received the Information
that the great powder magazine at St.
Petersburg and that at Toulon/ were to
be blown up within twenty-four hours.
The general was In bed when he heard
the news, but he at once got up and
started for St. Petersburg without los
ing 1 a moment. He summoned all the
staff of the magazine and went on a
round of Inspection. He found every
thing in order and as a proof of his
satisfaction ordered every one In the
magazine to take three days' holiday
and to leave at once. He then col
lected a new garrison and a new staff
and set a ring of sentries all round
the magazine. The consequence waa
that nothing: happened to the St. Pet
ersburg magazine, but that at Toulon
was blown up the next day. â Vanity

'A' well-known mining man of San
Francisco who has a country home in
San Mateo County is the father of a
five-and-a-half-year-old girl who Is as
"sharp as a steel trap."
A few day3 since, the father -was
about to leave home for the city when
his wife, in the presence of the child,
asked her husband for some money.
The mining man slowly put his hand in
his pocket and, taking therefrom a half
dollar, remarked "Darling, that's all
I've got just now."
The mother pouted, looked displeased
and was about to say something when
the little one, looking up Into her
mother's face, said: "Mamma, Jf you
didn't go to that whist club so often
you wouldn't have to ask papa for
money."
The husband patted the little girl on
the head and gave his wife a glance
that meant "didn't I tell you to keep
away from the club," while there was
a look of supreme satisfaction on his
countenance. But that soon faded away
when he heard the child say: "Now,
papa, if you : didn't smoke so many
two-bit cigars you'd have money to
give mamma when she needs It."
It was then the mother's turn to
smile.

WITHIN the coming summer the wonders of the
Big Basin Park, in Santa Cruz County, the new
pleasure ground that has been provided by the
State of California, will bedome known, through per
sonal observation, to thousands of Calif ornians. The
State's commissioners, who are empowered to provide
rules and regulations, have determined upon certain safe
guards against fire, that the giant sempervirens tree3
may be entirely safe. Selected sites are designated for
campers and there will be no camps at any unauthorized
place in the basin. By this provision it will be possible*
for the park warden to keep watch on all fires that are
started. No fires will be permitted except at particular
spots. The safety of the trees Is the first consideration.
The State has appropriated a large sum of money that
they may be. preserved and that is naturally the first care
of the commissioners.
The entire Big Basin Park* will now be opened for
summer occupation by whoever desires to summer there
in. The announcement in this regard will awaken inter
est far beyond the borders of California, and among
those who will camp in the shadows of the immemorial
trees will be wanderers and sight-seers from many lands.
In this aspect the Big Basin Park will advertise this
State and will be another certain lure to draw within the
borders of California many very desirable persons.
Botanists say that some of the sempervirens. trees now
growing in the Big Basin are 4000 years old. They were
growing in the days of the Pharaohs, gaining strength
from the climate /and from the abundance of water for
their roots which the configuration of the Big Basin as
sured. Century after century "their stature has in
creased. To them lovers of nature, the tourist, the art
ist, the student/a^nd men, women and children in search
of a wholesome- outing amid congenial surroundings,
may resort. Their broad arms and generous shade will
give welcome to all, classes and conditions of men,
women and children, all of whom may be refreshed and
invigorated:
The commissioners for the park have several ideas for
the general improvement of the new pleasure ground.
There are streams of good size that flow through the
wooded area. Among. these are the east and west forks
of the Waddell creek. It is proposed by the commis
sioners to make slackwater in one or more of the streams
this season by damming the flow at convenient places.
This device will result in giving sufficient depth for ca
noes or other small boats of very light draft to float up
and down for some distance. The courses of the 'sinuous
creeks, so to be enhanced in volume, lie under the shad
ows of the sempervirens. . There one may drift and
dream and build "castles in Spain" or elsewhere and be
conscious of surroundings that antedate the governmen
tal forms and customs of any nation of earth.
Santa Cruz County has already taken cognizance of
the need of direct communication by carriage roads on
an easy grade with the Big Basin Park. One favorite
drive for visitors to Santa Cruz will be the Big Basin.
Other roads will be constructed into the basin. Santa
Clara County will undoubtedly provide its own means
of getting to the basin by private conveyance from San
Jose and other points. Certain Santa Cruz County
papers arc advocating the construction of an electric road
from the city of Santa Cruz to the basin.

. 'A well-known oculist, who has an
ofBce on West Seventh street, while
discusEing some of the various defects
of the human eye which are not notice
able to the ordinary observer, has this
to Bay about color-blind people:
"The world must be a curious place to
color-bUnd people, of whom there are
forty males and three females to every
3000 persons. Some are blue-yellow
blind, and everything seems either red,
izreen or gray to them; others are red
jrreen blind, and all things appear to
them to be yellow, blue or gray of
various shades, and others again per
ceive no distinction of color at all, but
the whole world wears an unchanging
aspect of dull gray.
. .'To these last a visit to a picture gal
lery would reveal merely a collection of
engravings or photographs. But the
two former have the compensation of
seeing their own two- colors much more
brightly than ordinary people.
"The color blind do extraordinary
things at times. An officer of the -navy
went one day to buy material "for a
Â«--oat, vest and trousers. He bought a
blue coat and red trousers, believing
them of the satne color. A British ad

â¢ '11. E. TVeinland has been making a
eeries of researches to show why the
digestive secretions do not attack the
?wdy of different living organisms.
The organs which carry on digestion
are charged with ferments which are
powerful 'in attacking and dissolving
the aliments which are introduced, but
nevertheless they have no action upon
the surface of these organs or upon the
parasites whichoften' lodge there. The
reason for this has not been clear. In
3891, J. Frenzel gave the opinion that
the parasites were protected by an anti
ferment which they secreted, and this
could account fcrr the fact that tape
â¢vrorms. for instance, could take up their
lodging in such organs. M. Weinland
made some experiments which are of
interest in this line of ideas. He took
a certain quantity of fibrin and placed
it' In a pepsin solution in order to dis
Â«<?Ive it. at the same time adding a
email quantity of liquid obtained from
the tape-worm (taenla). He found that
in this case r.o digestion o? the fibrin
occurred, even though it was left in
contact for an indefinite period, but
otherwise it would be dissolved in a
few hours. He thus considers that It is
not the living tissues themselves which
.resist the action of the digestive liquids,
but the secretions with which they are
impregnated. The anti-ferment which
he succeeds In extracting Is very power
ful in Its action, and It keeps its prop
erties for many months; it loses them
by boiling, however. A temperature of
CO deg. C. for 10 minutes has but little
effect, but at Â£0 deg. the activity is
lessened. The active principle can be
precipitated from the Juice of the taenia
by alcohoL Although it opposes the
action of pepsin, a ferment and anti
ferment can be put in presence without
destroying each other. The latter
yeems to exert only an opposing, and
1 not a destructive action on the fer
ments, and when removed the ferments
commence to act as usual. â Scientific

the trick with $5000.

cisco asking If that amount of money
should be put up. The reply waa "Any
thing up to $10,000." The heeler took
55000 In bills and called upon the mis
sionary. Once out of hearing of pos

The new'White 'Star liner Baltic is

to take.. Even the rhythmic beats of
an unseen steamer's screws are regis
tered by means of this delicate ap

electric lead for ascertaining the depta

is, further, an electric device for reg
istering all signals,, including steam
sirens. The Baltic is equipped with
electric refrigerating, as well as olec
tric cooking apparatus.â Scientific

The Electrical Review calls attention
to the fact that hardly a day passes in
which several telephone companies are
not incorporated in the smaller cities
and towns throughout the country. In
the West It appears that farmers are
finding the telephone very useful not
only in conducting their household af
fairs, but in marketing their produce.
Formerly x the farmer stored his grain
In elevators, waiting for an advant
ageous time to sell. Now he stores it
himself, receives themarket quotations
over the telephone, and disposes of his
grain by telephone whenever, in his
judgment, he can do eo to the best ad
vantage. He does this without loss of
time, and has the satisfaction of closing
a bargain at once at current prices.
According to statistics compiled by
the Bell Telephone Company, there
â¢were. In 1902, 2,525,C06 telephones in the
hands of licensees under rental In the
United States. There was a total of
1,020,647 stations, and the number of ex
change connections dally was 7,531,761,
or a total per year of over 2.425,000,000.
The entire capital invested In telephone
systems in this country was estimated
at ?350.000,000. The statistics for 1903,
of course, will show a great increase In
the number of stations installed and
number of instruments under rental.

We doubt whether in any city in the world during
this Lenten season men have listened to more devoted
expounders of human duty, or have felt more keenly the
impulse toward all good, than here. The addresses
might be printed in a tract that every church could with
profit distribute to its members, and point to as evidence
that San Francisco takes the great and simple principles
of religion as its guide to all individual and civic right-
We believe that so far no race has been found that
has not some idea of a power external to man. The
conception may be crude. It may be disfigured by super
stition. Â¦ It may be productive of nothing more than an
idol or a fetich, or it may be refined to a high and in
effable abstraction, but its existence is universal. As
this conception rises in refinement, man rises in civiliza
tion. But he never outgrows it, nor ceases to feel the
need of belief in a power greater than himself. That
power is the final cause of righteousness, whether in the
individual or in the state. - i *;':" *-Â¦"Â¦'
We speak of. the ancients as pagan. But w.ho can read
the orations of Cicero, in which he called upon the great
Jove to witness the integrity of his purpose and the pur
ity of his patriotism, without feeling that the Roman
statesman was as sincere as an American Senator who
appeals to the higher p'owcr under a different name?
Who can doubt that the Roman found in his belief the
same motive toward righteousness that~the American
finds in the same belief under a changed form? y'
The business men of San Francisco have made good
and proper use of the Lenten season, by meeting daily
in the Chamber of Commerce, to listen to a brief and
non-sectarian service, and then to consider in sober
mindedness the duties of the citizen to his family, his
neighbors, his country and his city. In the range of
questions considered, everything that relates to the re
sponsibility of man in the social state has been consid
ered. The addresses have, been ; delivered by university
presidents, labor leaders, clergymen, jurists and men of
affairs.
There is a growing complaint that men do not attend
church. It is often said that- this abstention from the
formal observance of religion is evidence that they are
drifting into a condition of indifference to the serious
things which bear upon conduct, and that they are astray
even from the ethical impulse which gets its strength
from religion. These noonday meetings in Lent seem to
negative the serious conclusions derived from the lapse
of the church-going habit. Is it not true that men are
simply less interested in the fine, distinctions between
forms of faith and the rivalry of creeds, and under the
guidance of reason are learning to respect more the great
and single idea that is the foundation and source of them
all?
In these days, when the world rises in wrath against
those who maltreat; the Jews, and when the most de
voted Christian idealists see in Japan the defender of
the essentials of Christianity, and illustrating them in
the truthfulness of her statesmen and the discipline of
her soldiers, may we not conclude that men are. less in
terested *in dogmatic religion because they are more In
terested in that agreement of opinion which works out
in righteousness of life and conduct?
Perhaps not many of the busy men who have given an
hour daily to the meetings in the Chamber are regular
church-goers, but who shall say that'they are less inter
ested in all that .the church can teach, for the benefit of
the home, society, business and the state? It has been
customary to single out San Francisco as a city conspic
uously indifferent to serious things. The religious dia
lecticians have even called this the wickedest city, in the
Union. We who live here know how little these char
acterizations are deserved. We have a cosmopolitan
population, gathered from many countries and the far
islands of the sea. Here may be found Parsee and
Puritan, Jew and Gentile, Buddhist and Confucian, but
we may claim with confidence that the quality of mercy
and justice, faith and charity, is common taf them all.
Our Christian citizens, nominal and professed, rightly
march at the head of this procession of many races, but
they all have hands on the same life line, and are ready
to sacrifice for what in its essence is the same ideal.
FAR back in the history of the race men set apart
a portion of the year in which to -give special at
tention to the great issues of life. "Whether it be
the Jewish Passover, the Mahometan Ramadan or the
Christian .Lent, this pause in the busy occupations of the
people is evidence furnished by many races and under
divers forms of the religious idea, "that men feel the
need of introspection and that serious examination of
their master motives which lead to better living and the
cleaner discharge of their duties toward each other.

i At the twenty-ninth annual conven
j tion of the fruit growers of this State
; a committee of fifteen was appointed to
i devise and put Into effect a plan or
! plans to promote co-operation among
i producers of all classes of dried fruits
| on the Pacific Coast. Of this commit
: tee the following have been considering
J the Issues: A. R. Sprague of Sacra
, mento, F. H. Babb of San Jose, S. G.
j Rodeck of Campbell, Arthur R. Briggs
,' of San Francisco, H. P. Stabler of Tuba
i City. A. D. Bishop of Orange, W. P.
;Weber of Santa Paula. Thomas Jacob
s of Tulare, A. L. McCray of Fresno and
B. F. Walton of Tuba City. A. R.
i Sprague is the chairman and A. L. Mc
: Cray the secretary of the committee.
;. The committee has unanimously
j adopted the following resolutions as the
: basis of action:
j Resolved, That it is the sense of this com
: mitteÂ« that the fruit growers of the State,
; wherever practicable, organize .local assocla
| lions for the preparation of fruit for market.
ard that these several associations then con-
I nect themselves with some selling agency to
' make sale cf their crop at the best market
I rate, at such times and for such prices as the
i asency acting in conjunction with associate
j organizations may deem best. In case no such
selling agency is available or satisfactory, we
| recommend that they proceed to establish one
! by delegate representative from each such local
i association.
Also, that we further recommend that all
| selling agencies composed of organlied 1 grow
i ers unite by delegate membership to form a
: central selling and purchasing agency by which
: Uie highest advantages in buying and selling
1 may be secured, without, however. reliRquish
Â¦ iri any brand, trademarks or other advan
Â¦ tares peculiar to each, but eliminating to the
! greatest possible extent Injurious competition
, with each other in the market and in every
! practicable manner extending the consumption
! oi California cured fruits.
Also, that we disclaim any purpose to antag
j onize any Interest by such recommendations,
; belni fully aware that a large percentage of
i the business will remain to be done by estab
! lished organizations. But we believe that
: when a considerable portion of the growers be
Â¦ ccme thus organized it will be possible to find
i a common basis of agreement with such in
i terests by which market values may be sus-
I taJned and regulated better than at present.
Also, that we further recommend that such
j centralized agency at the earliest practicable
. moment develop a r'an for efficiently adver
! Using California cured fruits and planng them
j with the consumers at prices which shall pro
| vide for a fair avÂ«?raee profit to the grower,
I wholesaler and retailer.
We further recommend the formation of a
j committee t^Â» procure and make available sta
! tistics Jr. relation to the fruit products of the
, Pacific Ccast and competing countries.
The following resolution was also
unanimously passed:
Resolved. Th*t a committee of three, with
H. P. Stabler as chairman, be appointed to
outline and rut into operation a plan for in
creasing the consumption of the cured fruit
of tb.e Sta.te.
The chairman appointed on the com
mittee with Mr. Stabler, Arthur R.
Briggs and A. L. McCray.
The committee spent two days in
earnest deliberations, and while at first
wide difference of opinions was ex
pressed, the members came to unan
imous agreement in support of the plan
here outlined.
Passion Week, holiest in the churches'
calendar, begins to-morrow and in all
Catholic and places of wor
ship outward and visible evidences of

ing down of all elaborate ritual and an
increase in the penitential character of

active religious revival In which all

himself to his own parish and at all
the houses of worship a series of devo

daylight disappears. Caster Sunday,
which occurs on April 3, will be ob
served with special rejoicings. Com
ing so late In the spring, the wealth

display will be greatly increased. -The

Mr3. Fair willed to Mrs. Harvey her
famous Russian sable cape, her dia
mond sunburst and her diamond fleur
de lis. The cape was stolen by a
Parisian furrier, who, however, paid
to the administrator of the estate the
sum of $942, its value. Mrs. Harvey
says she" is content to receive the
money In place of the garment. She
also says that as the diamonds that
composed the fleur de 11s and the sun
burst were, a short time prior to Mrs.
Fair's death, reset into other jewelry

- Mr8.L.ydia A.-Prescott, who was ar
rested several weeks ago on complaint
of a woman, who accused her of. steal-
Ing a satchel on one of the; ferry-boats,
was ordered " dismissed .:â¢ yesterday " by
Judge Mogan at Â¦: the ; request < of ~the
urosecutins attorney,, who : stated that
"That evidence is so strongly in your
favor that I must acquit you of the less
serious offense," was the court's : rul
ing. V .
"Hopermaydie if I did."
Because he asserted that he did not
smoke cigarettes, Henry McAlpine, a
lanky and sallow youth, was acquitted
of the charge of playing ball- without
a bat on Fifth street; When the charge
had been rammed home tby Policeman
Whelton and the defendant had de
clined to dispute it, Judge Mogan
scanned him -with critical eye and then
inquired: - ; .
'.'How many cigarettes per. diem do
you burn?"
"Nar^ one," was the reply; "never
smoked a cig since I was born."
VSure?"/ r
James Snow, a colored man, who
was arrested for snatching a "watch
from Nels C. Nelson I at Geary and
Kcarny streets last Friday evening,
was booked for burglary, but yester
day Judge Mogan had the complaint
altered to grand larceny and set the
case for hearing next Wednesday.
Mary Jones, a negress, who interfered
when Snow was captured after a long
and exciting chase, was also arrested
and will be tried for vagrancy on the
aforementioned date.
Every one in court started, every
neck craned and every eye was leveled
at the disheveled contents of the
orisoners' pen. An awed murmur, in
which "Britt" was clearly distingush
able, wafted over the auditorium. .
"Hey? What's that? James Ed
ward what?" exclaimed the Judge,
eagerly scanning the equV.ly eager
countenances in the "pen."
"James Edward nothing â just James
Edward, that's all," was the clerk's
somewhat tart reply.
Bailiff Hickey started the gusty Â«igh
of relif that displaced the expectant
manner.
James Edward pleaded guilty to the
charge of keeping a lpttery shop and
the Judge postponed sentence till next
Wednesday. The arrest was made by
Officers Regan and O'Connor.
"The next case," said Clerk Gray to
Judge Mogan, "is that of James Ed
ward "
H. Stelling, an Ellis-street grocer,
was accused by Police Officer Tierney
of having offered for sale a can of
milk which official analysis proved to
be sadly deficient of butter fat, and
the defendant explained the debilitated
condition of the lacteal fluid by stat
ing that he had inadvertently neglect
ed to shake the can before supplying
the first draft upon it, thus giving . to
one customer much more of the float
ing substance that was intended for
equal distribution among many.
"I must accept your explanation and
dismiss the case," said Judge Cabaniss,
"but I would advise you to be certain
when you again sell milk that the can
is well shaken before the price is
taken."
. Robert Sieke. master of the sturdy
tugboat Milton, faile"d to show good
cause why he should not contribute to
the support of his two minor children,
and Judge Cabaniss ordered him to
pay their mother $15 a month until
they are able to provide for themselves.
It was a pitiful tale that the mother,
Mrs. Adle SR-ke of. 201 L*angton stMet,
told the Judge. When she was di
vorced from Sieke two years ago the
court awarded her the* custody of the
children, now aged six and eight years,
respectively, and she worked to keep
them and herself alive until her health
broke down and she was Incapacitated
for toil. Her two brothers and a sister
kept the wolf from her door until one
brother died, another went East and
the sister also became an invalid. Then
she adopted the advice of well wish
ing neighbors, gulped her pride for her
children's sake and applied to the
court to compel their father to . help
her feed and clothe them.
In defense of his conduct Sieke
pleaded that he married again and. is
the father of a third child and. that
his salary of $65 a month is barely
adequate to keep his second family
from want. To which the Judge re
torted that no man has a right to un
dertake the responsibility of maintain
ing a second family until he has in
sured the offspring of his first mar
riage from becoming paupers. ,
In evident dread that the yellow dis
turber of the nervous young lodger's
slumbers mieht be resurrected in the
heat of legal debate, his Honor con
tinued the case another week, advis
ing the disputants to dwell in peace
during that period and forever after

A yellow cat unexpectedly crept into
the testimony at the third hearing of
the Travers-Helbueh case before Judge
Mogan yesterday morning and for a
while threatened to upset the prose
cution's original theory, force adoption
of a new line of defense and necessi
tate Indefinite prolongation of the al
ready tedious dispute. Calamity was
averted, however, by the retirement of
the saff ron-hued intruder as suddenly
as it had been Introduced. There seem
ed to be Implied understanding' be
tween-the court and the attgrneys that
the animal's reappearance must be pre
vented at all hazards. .
Richard Travers of 110 Second ave
nue, Richmond District/ accused Spe
cial Policeman Fred Helbush, his next
door neighbor, of having maliciously
perforated the basement walls of the
Travers domicile with bullets fired from
a revolver. Helbush denied the charge,
and his wife was called to substan
tiate the denial. She it was who men
tioned the cat. In the Helbush home
dwelt a young man boarder, she said,
and he had often complained to her
of nocturnal serenades by the cat which
had murdered his sleep, because he was
a young man of nervous temperament.
She had not heard any shots fired' at
any time from any part of. her house,
and Ehe Just submitted. the' fact that
the young man had complained of the
caterwauling because 'Â¦ it might serve
to throw light upon any shooting that
might have taken place without her
knowledge. ... , ' â¢ , "
Other witnesses testified for the H de
fense, and most of their testimony was
apparently directed to the end of show
ing unreasonable antipathy of the com
plainant toward the defendant,', as
shown by the former's objection to the
latter's erection and maintenance of a
pigeon house in proximity to the Trav
ers residence. The exact distance of
the pigeon house from the Travers
house was variously estimated by the
witnesses, and for half an hour or more
the attorneys wrangled over it. In
the course of his perfervld pleading one
of the lawyers inquired if the pigeon
house was "disattached," . and then
amended his English by asking if it
was "non-touching" the premises of the
complainant.
That a good character is a convenient
thing to possess in certain emergencies
can be truthfully stated by Martin
Griffin, for it secured the dismissal of a
larceny charge against him in Judge
Mogan's court. \
Some clothing stolen from a house on
Tehama street was found in an unoc
cupied cellar from which Griffin had
just emerged, and he was followed by
two women, who had him arrested as
he was apparently endeavoring to elude
them. His defense was that he went
into the cellar, to recover a tobacco
pouch which' he. had accidentally
dropped down the staircase and that he
knew nothing whatever of how the
stolen property happened to be there.
After a careful investigation of the
defendant's character had been made
by order of Judge Mogan and the po
liceman had reported inability to find
anything criminal in it the case was
ordered dismissed and Griffith Informed
that he owed his liberation to the clean
liness of his record, Instead of 'to the
defense he set up.'
â¢ â¢ â¢
Police Officer Nelson told of the ar
rests and the events Immediately pre
ceding them. A : lot of Twenty-eighth
infantrymen .were holding wasail in the
Strasburg when a detachment of Tenth
infantrymen charged and attempted to
capture the floor and the ladies that
were gracefully swirling thereon, and
after a sharp and sanguinary defense
of their .fair partners the gallant
Twenty-eighters . were forced to fall
backward, but rallied and made a bar
ricade of chairs and other portable
furniture, behind which they placed the
ladies and then fought the invaders
until the police arrived. The men of
the Tenth retreated in order and evaded
arrest, but the interenched boys of the
Twenty-eighth were easy of capture.
The case has gone over until next
week.
As one ' of the results of a military
clash;; Jn . the . Strasburg dance hall, on
Pacific street, four privates of Company
A, Twenty-eighth Infantry, were be
fore. Judge Mogan on charges of dis
turbing the peace. Their' names are
James A. Lindsay, J..J. Wing, H. C.
Perring and Oma B. Ransom.
Judge Mogan â¢ held Violet Carter â¢ to
answer to the Superior Court on a
charge of having robbed a Portuguese
sailor of $140 and fixed her bail at $1000.
J. W. Stevens, a bartender in the
Washington-street â¢ saloon where the
robbery occurred, was arrested for com
plicity in the felony, but . the case
against, him fell to pieces.
"But the charge seems to be proven,"
remarked; the. Judge, "and I would like
to be: enlightened as to why you ask
for dismissal."
Then the penitent complainant ex
plained that he asked for dismissal be
cause the defendants were unacquaint
ed with the subtleties of the English
language and American business meth
ods and because he expected get
back about 25 per. cent of the money he
had lent them.
"You seem to be quite a shrewd busi
ness man yourself," was the Judge's
sarcastic comment as "he dismissed the
case for lack "of prosecution. Then he'
addressed some sharp words of reproof
to. Newroth for having trifled with the
majesty of the law and the time of the
court. ' . ' Â¦ Â¦ â¢ ' 'Â¦'?'Â¦'
Louis W. Ne wroth had two Greek
restaurateurs, P. Catsiftis/and J. Gi
noles, arrested for mortgaging to him
for 5300 their place of business, 27 Sev
enth street, , after they had already
mortgaged it to some one else, but
when the case came up before Judge
Mogan' yesterday Newroth declined to
porsecute. 1 .
Judge Conlan held Frank West to an
swer in the SuDerior Court on a charge
of assault with intent to commit rob
bery and fixed the bail at $1000. It was
on December 25, 1903, that West was ar
rested for attempting to rob Nels Lar
aen at Thirteenth and Flllmore streets.
every since her' "arrest the defendant
has been ill and. the complainant de
clines to press the charge against her.

Know the Value of Pyramid Pile Cure.
; "Gratitude alone prompts me to tes-
tify to the efficacy of Pyramid Pile
Cure.. Last March I bought a dollar
package at theHrus store, -which cured
me of bieedlngr pllea, and I was a suf-
ferer from them for eight years; but
I had not been troubled with them
Â¦lnce, until last September, when I
gave birth to a. baby girl, and after
that I had & very severe case of pro-
truding piles, which a trained nurse
said was the worst case she ever saw,
and my doctor told me to get Pyra-
mid Pile Cure again, which I did, and
was completely cured in three days.
I have not had piles of any kind since,
and It Is all owing to this wonderful
remedy. My nurse took a box, which
I was glad to be able to give her, for I
know she will be able to help lots of
suffering people -whom I could never
see or.know. .
. "I recommend 'Pyramids'- wherever
I knoW;Ofany one suffering as I did.
It gives me great pleasure to "be able
to say I am entirely cured, which my
doctor says is true. I say God bless
Pyramid Pile Cure." From a former
great sufferer, Mrs. F. Ancott, 1206
Unity street, Frankford, Philadel-
phia, Pa. - . ,\ Â¦Â¦
"This remedy, which is sold. by drug-
gists .generally, in : 50 cent' and dollar
packages, is in a suppository form, is
applied directly to the parts affected
and performs .its work quietly and
painlessly.; Its value Is evidenced by
the testimony given above, and we
urge ; all sufferers to buy a package
now and give it a trial to-night. Ac-
cept no substitutes and remember that
there is no remedy "Just as good." A
-little book; on the Cause and Cure of
Piles is published; by. the Pyramid
Drug Company, Marshall, Mich., and
will be sent free to any address.

Eighteen firemen who were working
their way into the. Adams Express
Company's building had a remarkably
narrow escape from being crushed by
falling walls. They had Just entered
the building from the Trinity place side
when the three upper stories caved in
and fell with a crash just as the men
pained the street. With the collapse of
the floors the fire blazed up more
fiercely.
The burning buildings reached
through to a narrow alley in the rear,
and as the wind eddied through it
swept clouds of smoke into Broadway,
so thick that only occasionally could
the flames be seen. The smoke rolled
up the street, hemmed in by the tall
buildings, and great Caming brands fsll
thickly in the crowds.
Closely following the first alarm a
"four" was turned in. and then, with
the warning of the Baltimore fire in
mind, a "two-nine," the dreaded gen
eral alarm, followed. Engine after en
gine, followed by their hoae trucks,
water towers and ladder trucks, swept
clanging down Broadway, the only
street of access to the fire, bringing in
their wake additional thousands cf peo
ple to swell the crowd that already
packed every inch of standing room in
the vicinity. Bursting hose and a back
roll of choking smoke now and then
drove them back and aided the police
reserves to clear the streets.
Being so near Wall street, the blaze
attracted more than 100.000 specta
tors. It took 300 policemen to main
tain order. The building burned was
an old fashioned five-story structure
overlooking Trinity Church.
* Smoke poured into the offices of the
Wella-Fargo Express Company at 63
Broadway, compelling all in the build
ing to flee- Before leaving the clerks
hastily threw $ 100.000 in gold, silver
and checks Into canvas bags and car
ried the treasure in safety to a bank.
Several alarms called out forty-four
companies to fight the fire. Chief Cro
1 ker was called from the deathbed of
I his mother in Bloomfield. N. J.. so
threatening did the blaze appear at
one time.
The fire was confined to the build
ing in which it started.
When the neighborhood in which
the fire occurred is taken.. ioto con
sideration it was the most spectacular
daytime blaze that has occurred for
I a long time in that part of the city.
I Thousands of people poured from the
thickly populated financial district
into the narrow canyon of Broadway
and massed back for squares above
and below the blaze. The towering
skyscrapers that, face the fire held a
j group of faces at every window.

Krum. He called the Jury's attention
to the provision of section 1TS2 of th*
Revised Statutes, under which the in
dictment was found, that should th*
defendant be convicted he win forever
be prevented from holding any offlca
under the Government of the United
States. HÂ» cited this, he said, so the
jury, ia considering the case, would
carefully weigh tha fact whether a.
Senator of the United States, a lawyer
and a far-sishted man would render
himself to be forever debarred from
holding a Federal oclce for the consid
eration he received from the Rialto
Company. . Judge Xruzn did not review
the evidence in detail, but devoted his
argument to placing the facts in the
case, as deduced by the evidence, be
fore the jury.
' / . ATTACKS INDICTMENT.
-T*ynaTTn wu followed by Bert IX
' Norton!, Assistant District Attorney.
1 who confined himself almost exclusive
ly to the reasons alleged \>y the Gov
ernment for which Senator Burton was
. employed by the Rialto Company. He
quoted freely from the transcript of
.the evidence siven by the witnesses
of the Government, and attempted to
'Â¦ bring strongly before the Jury the con
tention of the prosecution that Sen
ator Burton â¢was engaged by the Rialto
Company solely for his influence as
a United States Senator tn any mat
ters that might come to the attention
of the Postnffice Department affecting
that concern.
Dyer was followed by Attorney F.
W. Lehmann, who made the opening
argument for the defense. He briefly
summed up, the evidence brought out
during the triaL Lehmann laid espe
cial stress upon the testimony given
by Senator Eurton. and brought out
strongly the explanation given by
Burton as to the reasons for his em
ployment by the Rialto Grain and Se
curities Company.
QUOTES t FROM EVIDENCE.

Cincinnati was placed ca the stand to

ment Cor compensation."*

ment was made by Cochrane.

guments for tbe Government. JÂ»o limit
was placed on the time for arsument
by either side.

What the addition to the total num
ber of voters in the country is likely
to be this year is very hard to con
jecture, for the reason that between
1896 and 1900, so far as the election
returns show, there was practically no
gain in the number of electors. From
187C to 1880 there was a gain of 800,
000; from 1880 to 1884, a gain of
1,000,000; from 1S84 to 1888, a gain
of 1,300,000; from 1888 to 1892, a
gain of 500,000, and from 1892 to 1896.
a gain of 1,900,000. Between 1876
and 1896 the popular vote for Presi
dential electors increased 65 per cent,
or from 8,400,000 to 13,900,000.
Apparently owing to the fact that a
vast multitude of voters did not go to
the polls at all in 1900, the total popu
lar vote in that, year was only 40,000
greater than*it was In 1896; and,, if
anything like a full vote is polled next
fall there should be an enormous un
precedented increase In 1 the total vote.
In the > eight years ended with No
vember, 1S96, this' vote increased
2,400,000, and, as the population of
the country has been steadily expand
ing since 1896, the total vote this year
should show a far greater increase
than that of 1888-96. %
A thing that rend-era it extremely
difficult to forecast what the increase
in this vote may be is the fact that an
exceptionally large number of immi
grants have landed on our shores in
recent years. In the eight years end
ed with 1903 over 3,500.000 foreign
born persons. were added to our popu
lation, and a considerable proportion
of those persons . is now naturalized,
and they will take part in the next
election. What the proportion may be,
however, it is impossible to judge.
It Is none too: early for .political
: leaders and managers to grasp the fact
that "first voters" are likely, to con
stitute a more important factor in, the
approaching campaign than ever be
i fore, and, as a consequence, that' they
are likely to prove" a greater unknown
quantity than haa ever been the case
hitherto. "Evidently both of the. great
political parties will need to do a vast
amount of missionary work if -they
hope for victory in November.--New

Jack Martin, who departed for the
East last night, had ninety-seven win
ning mounts to his credit. Some of
Jack's rides were open to criticism, but
as a rule he did his best.
Idogo warmed up lame, and was or
dered scratched by the judges. This
was fortunate for the backers of Past
Master, as the McCafferty horse could
have wen on three legs.
If Crosswaite cannot get his mounts
away from the barrier he should be
Fchooled or set down for incompetency.
There was no excuse for his "Barney"
on Cloche d'Or.
Letola, winner of the fifth event, was
bid up from $S00 to $1200 by E. J. Ram
sey. Walter Jennings, of course, bid
the customary $5 to retain.
Cloche d'Or was pounds the best of
those starting for the final mile selling
affair and then suffered defeat: ' The
mare went to the post favorite, but
Crosswaite for some reason was sound
asleep at the start, getting away badly.
Past Master, the good thing in the
race, backed from 8 down to 5, was
awarded a nose decision over Carilee.
One or more selections like this should
be rendered every day.

Britt and his intimates claim that
130 pounds Is his best weight, but there
was much comment on the tucked up
appearance of his body when he
stripped for the fray. It was the im
pression of. some representative medi
cal men who watched him closely that
he was at a weight which would work
irreparable damage to him if he made
it again.
Britt points to the fact that he recu
perated readily after each fierce rally
to show that his vitality had not been Im
paired. The medical men said It was
only his youth that carried him through
the ordeal in safety.
With Gans out of the reckoning. Britt
is conceded a clear title to the light
weight championship.
While no championship was involved
in Friday night's contest the outcome
practically makes Britt the world's
lightweight champion. He can scoff at
the pretensions of Joe Gans, now that
he has proved his mettle against so
good a man as Young Corbett. It is the
general impression that Gans has so far
outgrown the lightweight limit that he
can do but little better than 138 pounds.
Britt and Corbett fought at a weight
between two recognized classes. As
there cannot be a distinctive class for
each pound in weight, this match car
ried no- distinctive class with it.
said Corbctt. "When I was knocking
the head off Hanlon and the crowd
yelled for him to break us he threw up
his hands and said 'That's the rules
they are fighting -under."
"I was fighting two men Friday
night. Graney was the busiest little
man I ever saw in a ring and when
he broke us apart he was always be
tween my right hand and Britt.
"If he had let me fight as I am
accustomed to I would have won in
ten rounds. I want to fight Britt
again and the only thing I specify is
that the weight be 130 pounds at 6
o'clock. Britt can fix the purse any
way he desires and he can have a
$10,000 side bet If he wants."
Corbett is particularly bitter against
Graney. He says he was told he
would get the worst of the decision
if Britt was on his feet at the end of
twenty rounds.
Corbett and his party will leave this
morning for Chicago, where he will
box Mowatt next Saturday. He will
then go on to Boston. 4
CAN SCOFF AT GANS.
Jack O'Neill of Philadelphia Nearly
Lowers the Colors of Californian.
PHILADELPHIA, March 26. â
"Jack" O'Neill, the local fighting ma
chine, nearly put Eddie Hanlon, the
San Francisco boy, to sleep to-night in
the six-round fight at the National
Athletic Club. The fighter from the
Golden Gate received a terrific beat
ing in the third and fourth rounds and
It seemed he would surely be knocked,
out. The first two rounds were even.
HAXIiON" BADLY PUNISHED.
The Britt-Corbett fight of Friday
night was the principal theme of con
versation yesterday in the clubs and
in the sporting resorts^ Many friend
ships were strained to the breaking
point as arguments grew heated over
the justness of the decision rendered
by Referee Graney.
After thinking it over calmly the ad
herents of Young Corbett, outside his
immediate circle of friends, admitted
that the best they expected was a
"draw" decision.
The appearance of the two men yes
terday was reminiscent of the last
fight between Jeffries and Fitzslm
mons. The day after the fight Fitz
simmons, who was defeated, appeared
on the streets with an injured hand as
the only sign of the encounter in which
he had taken part. Champion Jef
fries, with his cut and battered face,
was a sight. , ; " ' 'WV
Corbett was about yesterday and the
only visible mark on him was the cut
over the left eye, which he sustained
in a bumping match with Britt. The
little Denver man complained after
the fight of a soreness about the body
and it hurt him to take a deep breath.
He made little of that yesterday.
BltlTT NOT PRESENTABLE. *
Britt was. not presentable as to face,
but bodily and mentally he was active
and alert. His face was discolored and
cut and his right hand and forearm
were out of commission. The hand will
be subjected to an examination under
the X-ray, while the arm will prob
ably be placed in a plaster cast for sev
eral weeks.
As a balm to Jimmy's feelings a
statement of the box office receipts was
shown him. The total receipts were
$33,000, although the attendance repre
sented a house of fully 440,000. Many
were passed in by city officials and
others. Britt's share for the eighty
minutes of fighting was $15,592 50. Cor
betfs loser's end was $9157 50. The pro
moters' share was $S250.
Britt said yesterday that while he was
tired at times during the fight he was
never groggy from punishment. He
said there was no time during the fight
when Corbett had a chance to beat
him. He expressed a willingness to give
Corbett a return match later in the
year. Britt's plans for future are
at present unformed. He knows a gold
en harvest awaits him in the East, and
he will undoubtedly make the pilgrim
age across the continent at the earliest
opportunity. He received fully fifty tel
egrams yesterday offering him boxing
and theatrical engagements.
CORBETT HEARTBROKEN'.
Corbett was heartbroken yesterday
and seemed unable to shake off the de
pression which hung about him. He
thought Referee Graney had given him
the worst of it both during the fight
and in his decision.
"He did not let me fight Britt as he
let me fight Hanlon ' and Sullivan,"
' LOS, ANGELES, March 26â Oscar
Graham was in" good form to-day and
the best the Angels could get was
three .hits off his delivery. Gray
pitched 'good ball for the home team,
but 'the visitors, landed on him for
nine hits, three of them being doubles.
Gray, got . touched up badly in the
sixth. Graham singled to center, Gan
ley. .sacrified and Francks doubled,
scoring Graham. Kruger bunted out
a single and went to second on Ross'
unsuccessful effort to catch Francks
at the olate. Jud Smith ran Kruger
down.
In the last inning the Angels got in
a run, owing to an error by Devereaux
and Graham's wildness. Graham
walked Eager, forcing the run, but
wound up the game by striking out
Raymond when the .bars were full.
There was no attempt to play Frank
Dillon to-day. ! Dillon will remain
here until the final settlement of his
case by the national committee. Score:

X-Raya From Plants.
Botanists have recently been investi
gating the N-rays, an<l we are told
that they are emitted from plants, as
well as from nerves and muscles, and
that the fluorescent screen will glow
when brought near to the plant, espe
cially the leaves and the roots, where
the effect is more pronounced than in
the case of the flower. N-rays are
emitted from such plants as onions and
mushrooms, so that they do not seem
to depend upon the presence of chloro
phyll or green coloring matter, their
intensity being apparently due to the
activity and condition of the vegetable
protoplasm. This was shown by the
fact that the N-rays were produced
from germinated seedllng3 and not
from those which had not germinated,
while their emission was stopped en
tirely on using chloroform to suspend
the vital activity of the plant.âHar

#e:sl-&jxnual field day of the Bay
Counties Athletic Leagrue on the uni
versity oval this cfternoon was a
heartbreaking thins for a spectator
with, sympathies Tor any of the com
petitors.
Â¦ At last TAcH. sneered at at first asd
then feared, carried the day. It needed
the relay rltcer* and a hammer thrower
co d.p the trick and Lick's men respond
ed to the call. Up to the time for these
two last cveiita Lick was somewhat In
m erump. . bnt still fighting. Oakland
first, Lowell was second and Lick
third. Two points separated each of
the trio.
Then came the relay race â the nerve-
Cr^li^s tfclcg of ihe day. It meant vic
tory to the school that won. Tho youths
*f flying: feet were nerved up to their
highest. Their partisan* on the bleach
xirs strained every nerve to see. " The
riE^&renot rang- out and they were off.
Jtound -i-^d round they flew. At the
Â«ud'cf each !ap a fresh runner was on
i-.u-d to take up the etruersle for his
"tired mate. It was a hard, square bat
"tJe and Lick, ever in front from tho
â¢tart, finished first. Oakland was sec
ond, and" Lowell third.
, Tfcis victory grave Lick ten points,
but still Ehe was only half a point
ahead cf Oakland. Oakland had 40
and . Lick 4OVs. with Lowell
lar ijehiRS, with 84 points. One more
*ietory ' ivas needed and th!s came in
Xhi hammer throw. True, Lick did not
Vim. but two of her men pot second
and third places and thus added four
Â«nore points to the total for the school.
, The final ecore for the day reads
asTcllo-ns: Lick School, 44^4; Oakland
JJigh School. 40; Lowell School. 34;
"Berkeley School, 23; Alameda

A!s for the performance* of the
Fprlnters and runners for the day there

--"^^^^^^^^^lv^^Kl^^^^fVp?B Electric Belt, the marvel of electricians, the most wonderful curative device thai has
' \ ever 'been introduced. This Belt is complete with Free Electrical Suspensory.
This Electric Suspensory carries the current direct and cures all weaknesses of men, varicocele, etc. It develops and expands all
weak nerves and checks a loss of vitality. No case of Failing Vigor, Varicocele or Debility can resist this powerful Electric Attach-
ment. It never fails to cure.
Mr. E. F. Iiohman. Hooker, Cal., writes, March 11: "The feeling of despondency is cone and I have perfect confidence In myself now. I'm a well man."
No man should be weak, no man should suffer the loss of that vitality which renders life worth living. No man should allow;
himself to become less a man than nature intended him, no man should suffer when there is at hand a certain cure for his weakness.
Most of the pains, most of the weakness of stomach, heart, brain and nerves, from which men suffer, are due to an early loss of
nature's reserve power. You need not suffer for this. You can be restored. The very element which you have lost you can get back,
and you may be as happy as any man that lives.
My Electric Belt, with special Electric Suspensory, will restore your power. It will check all loss of vital power and affects
every organ of the body.
Mr. W. F. Quite, Reno. Nev., writes, March 10: "Tour Belt cured ma after I had spent $1000 In useless doctorlnc* \
I have cured thousands of men who have squandered the savings of years in useless doctoring. <
My Belt is easy to use; put it on when you go to bed ; you feel the glowing heat from it (no sting or burn, as in old syle belts),
and you feel the nerves tingle with the new life flowing into them. You get up in the morning feeling like a two-year-old.
An old man of 70 says he feels as strong and young as he did at 35. That^hows it renews the vigor of youth. It cures Rheu-
matism, Sciatic Pains, Lumbago, Kidney Trouble. Banishes pain in a night, never to return.
Mr. A. C. Hammond. 330 Pine street San FranciBCO, says, March 20: "At the age of 75 your Belt has cured me of general weakness and kidney trouMa"
What ails you? Write and tell me, and no matter where you are I think I can give you the address of some one in your town that I have
cured. I've cured thousands, and every man of them is a walking advertisement for my Belt.

However, if some of the Eastern rules
are found superior to those now In
force they will be adopted, but It is not
Intended to make any radical changes.
In all likelihood the rules will be in
the main the same as they have been
for some time past, the principal
change being made in the matter of
placing responsibility for the proper
conduct of the schools where It belongs.
One rule which will be made more
binding in character will be the sec
tion relating to ventilation, which the
board has ascertained is not strictly
complied with by teachers. The rule
provides that teachers shall give vigi
lant attention to the ventilatiqn and
temperature of their rooms, 'and shall
especially -avoid an excessive degree of
heat. During the season in which fires
are required in . schools teachers must
endeavor to keep their rooms at a tem
perature not below 65 degrees and not
above TO degrees Fahrenheit. A pro
vision may be added to the rule for the
purpose of enforcing: compliance with
Its requirement, as the board considers
that proper ventilation is of vital con
sequence to pupils.
The Board of Education- is now con
sidering the rules governing the admin
istration of the public schools in sev
eral Eastern cities irr "connection with
the revising of, the lpcal rules now In
force. President Roncovieri yesterday
received copies of the rules of Roches
ter and Chicago with. a view to incor
porating some of the best features .con
tained therein 2 in ,the â¢ regulations in
vogue here.
The rules of the Eastern cities differ
from the local rules In that the educa
tional work Is left entirely to the Su
perintendent of Schools, the adminis
trative part of the work being vested
in the Board of Education. It. is not
intended, -however, by the. Board of
Education of this city, to surrender any
of Its vested powers to the Superintend
ent, since this could not be done with
out the consent of the State Legisla
ture. "' . Â¦ Â¦ . '. .

The Board of Education has also been
consulting with, the members of the
Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors to the end that a sufficient
appropriation may be made in the next
municipal budget to., put the various
schools in a sanitary condition. Super
visor d'Ancona of tho committee has
made a personal inspection of some of
the schools considered to be the worst
from a sanitary point of view.
Among the schools in which the
plumbing and drainage has been found
to be defective are the Pacific Heights.
Lowell High, Dudley Stone, Everett
and the Sunnyside. Plumbing Inspector
Mulligan has reported that the entire
plumbing system in tlft Pacific
Heights School should be reconstructed.
The Health Board has instructed the
district health officers to inspect all the
schools again next Monday, Tluesday
and Wednesday and to make fiflal and
complete reports regarding their sani
tation. Upon the nature of the reports
filed the Board- of .Health will take of
ficial action, which may result in the
closing of the schools before the end
of the regular term.
The officials named have learned from
inquiries that some of the schools, con
sidered the best of their kind, have de
fective plumbing and the lavatories
are of an obsolete pattern. The exist
ing conditions are so bad that the
Health Board believes that much sick
ness will result among the pupils, espe
cially when the warm weather sets in.
To avoid such results the Health Board
probably will order the closing of the
schools found, defective in drainage
construction for the purpose of remedy
ing the evils.
The district health officers have been
filing such : startling reports regarding
the deplorable condition of the plumb
ing and drainage -.In a number of the
public schools that the Board of Health
is preparing to order the closing of
some of the institutions on the ground
that the existing sanitary conditions
are a menace to the health of the
pupils. The foregoing statement was
made yesterday by Deputy Health Of
ficer Levy.
For the last month District Health
Officers Tillman, Dillon and Adler have
been pursuing systematic investiga
tions into the drainage systems of the
schools in their several districts, and
the Health Board has arrived at the
conclusion that something must -be
done to safeguard the health of the
pupils.

The Indications are that there will
be a very large throng of visitors dur-,
ing the conclave week of the Knights
Templar. Thus far the hotel commit
tee has secured rooms for 10,500 per
sons and the demands are still being
received. Arrangements are being
made to secure accommodations for
10.000 more in private residences.
'Arrangements are also being made to
furnish the visiting Knights free
transportation on the street cars dur
ing the week. Excursions are being
arranged to many points for merabers
of the fraternity and the Grand Op
era-house for the purpose of giving
Chinese theatrical performances to
entertain the commanderies. A num
ber of the counties will have exhibits
at some central point, possibly on one
of the public parks. '

much interest in the programme' that
had. been prepared for their entertain

the night before.
. Although the children were largely in
the majority, a goodly number of adults
was also on hand. The little ones thor
oughly enjoyed themselves, and their
voices blended in childish glee at the
events calculated to impress the juve
nile mind. The Japanese trick. donkey,
the smallest horse in the world, the
property of Thomas H. Williams Jr.;
Miss Norwood's trained dog and many
other features were liberally patronized.
The following programme was ar
ranged for the matinee performance: .

commended.

...THE CALL'S EASTER PICTURE...
â¢ The cold black and white half -tone, below gives one but a faint conception of the
beauty of the original one in colors, which the publishers of the Sunday Call secured
for their exclusive use.
A Beautiful Painting f=j ft Study from Life
"An Easter Offering."
ST. JOSEPH LILIES.
This Easter Supplement is produced by an entirely new process, and is issued for
' the first time in this country by The Call. : r - âÂ¦ -
This particular picture is presented with the idea that there is a certain element of
interest in the portrayal of real people that is not brought out by either drawings , or.
paintings, hence the study depicted above has a living interest that is impossible in. the
most famous paintings. . -
A Tonnessen photograph of a beautiful woman and a child first gave the artist the
basic conception of this new idea. To the graceful lines and features of the photo-
graph were added the delicate tints, clever, fancies and transforming touches that made
of the resultant picture a thing of artistic beauty and excellence, quite aside from its
original value as a portrait
'/An -Easter Offering" is an example of the highest class work of this kind and
represents* the advance which has recently been made, in chromatography or. color . -

Carlos Gonzaga, who was convicted
by a Jury on a charge of burglary, was
sentenced by Judge Lawlor to serve
three years in Folaom penitentiary. He
broke into the toolhouse of W. J. Camp
bell, Townsend and Jordan streets, on
January 3.
Yesterday was sentence day In the
Superior courts. In Judge Lawlor's
court Robert A. Mlrowsky, who pleaded
guilty to-a charge of forgery, waa sen
tenced to- serve two years in San Quen
tin. Mlrowsky had been employed as
bookkeeper by thÂ« Western Fish Com
pany and after being discharged for
peculating forged the name of J. B.
Inguglia. the manager, to two checks
on the Central Trust Company.
Mlrowsky came here In the begin
ning of 1901, claiming that he was &
Russian Count. In May of that ytar
he married Mrs. 'Fanny Rosenthal, who
has a tobacco store at 413 Montgomery
street, but as he squandered her money
in fast living acd pawned her' Jewels
she procured a divorce from him in the
following September. He now clalma
that he was a lieutenant in the Italian
army for several years, and that hd
owes his misfortune to gambling.
The Judge In passing sentence said:
"The court is convinced that this case
can be traced to Â« the gambling evil
which has grown so alarmingly in our
midst. The temptation ta gamble in
some form or other Is encountered at
every turn In the daily life of this. city,
and because of these temptations those
who are not strong enough to resist
them become outcasts and criminals.
In a moral sense the community is
steadily retrograding. Crime due to
temptation which finds apparent coun
tenance in the administration of the
law Is an every day story In San Fran
cisco. Men, women and children who
are not born with evil dispositions are
going wrong because strong tempta
tions are spread before them. It is an
unhappy state of affairs and in this
case It has produced Just as marked
a tragedy in the life of a human being
as though that life itself had been sac
rificed."

hundred dollars' worth of silver plate,
which. was stolen on July 19, 1902,
from the residence of Socrates Huff,
president of the San Leandro Bank,
by Rosael Torres was discovered hid
den â¢ in a thicket near San Leandro
Creek to-day by Vantls Huff master, a,
small boy residing with his parents in
San Leandro. The little fellow was
fishing in the creek, when he saw a
bright object protruding ( from the
ground and on digging it up brought
to light a silver mug. Further dig
ging resulted in the discovery of all
the plate stolen from the Huff resi
dence, and the boy at once returned
it to the owner. "
Shortly after the robbery Torres
was arrested in San Francisco in the
company of a young girl he had ab
ducted from Fruitvale and he was
convicted of the robbery on circum
stantial evidence and sentenced to
eleven years in San Quentin, but until
to-day no trace -was found of the" sto
len silver.

In England leap year is supposed
to confer upon the fair sex the privi
lege of choosing life partners for bet
ter or for .worse, but the custom is
more honored in the breach than In
the observance. The gypsies, especial
ly in Hungary, enjoy and make a very
extensive use of the right at all times.
In accordance w.ith an ancient custom.
Thus a marriageable young gypsy girl
in the land of the Magyars, as soon
as her heart is smitten, takes good
care that the smiter shall hear of the
havoc he has wrought and have a
chance of consoling her. With this
praiseworthy object in view, she has
a love letter indited, places a coin in
a piece of dough, bakes it and throws
the billet-doux during the night into
Jhe bedchamber of her bridegroom

patience and awaits developments.
The Burmese maiden begins her mar
riage campaign at a much earlier
stage. In order to get together a
goodly gathering of young men from
whom to choose, she places a lamp
in her window at nightâ^lt is known
as the "lamp 'of love^ â and entices

The Yalu River, a picturesque
stream, some 300 miles in lensth, is
the dividing line between Korea and
Manchuria on the northwest frontier.
It is navigable by native craft as fnr
es Phlnkuihuo, but steamers are un
able to proceed beyond Antung, the
port to which the Russians are now
devoting considerable attention. Some
miles below Antung, but situated In
the same bank and lying close within
thÂ» estuary of the river, is the port of
Tatungkao. where, when the weather
permits*. cargoeR for Antung are some
times discharged. Tatungkao, how
ever, is difficult to approach, and. as a
general rule steamers unload and re
ceive their cargoes at Antung, a port
of great promise in the near future.
The estuary of the Yalu River is
broad, but the anchorage of Tatung
kao fa exposed to the northeast winds.
T.hich at times blow with great force.
The ftream has a rapid current, and,
owing to the presence of innumerable
Fhoals and sand banks, presents se
rious obstacles to successful naviga
tion. Islands, both small and large,
appear in its course, and high hills,
cov?n?d with bush and timber, break
away from the banks.
From early December until the end
â¢of February the stream is frozen. Un
til lately the region of the Yalu was
ohnost an unknown land, but with the
advent of the Russians many changes
In the character of the district have
taken place. On the Korean shore
lumber ramps have been formed,
while at Tatungkao and Antung pros
perous native settlements have
sprung into existence. The river
teems with native craft, which ply be
tween the mouth and the higher
reaches, while logs of timber, chained
the one to the. other, float leisurely
down the ftream.
The view at the estuary Â«.: the river
Is, perhaps, not very prepossessing. A
long vista of mud fiats extends mile
upon mile along the river bank, but

1808 â A numerous and respectable
meeting of the merchants and other
inhabitants of Liverpool, interested in
the trade of America, was held on
Friday, in that town, in pursuance of
a requisition for, that purpose, when
the late Orders In Council were taken
into consideration. Mr. Rathbone, in
a long and able speech, detailed the
various advantages this' country de
rived from the American' trade, in the
course of which, he stated, that nearly
flye hundred voyages are made from
'America to England alone in the
course of a year, in ships, the, burden
of which amounted to more than 123,
000 tons; that the amount of British
manufactures annually exported to
American was more than Â£10,000,000;
that the Government derived from thte
Liverpool portion of the trade alone
not less than Â£1,000,000 a year, and
that the average debt due from Amer
ica to this country Is not less than
Â£12,000,000, the payment of which is
now interrupted by the embargo in the
American ports. Mr. Rathbone next
took a view of the American trade to
the West Indies, and stated the de
pendence, of those islands on America
for provisions. He then adverted to
the trade of America to the East
Indies and China, the export to each
Of Â£500,000 annually in silver only,
and the facility which this was ad
mitted to give to the trade of our
East India Company. Mr. Rathbone
concluded by lamenting the interrup
tion of all these sources of revenue,
and with exposing the mischievous ef
fects of the late Orders in Council. He
was followed by Mr. Richardson, Mr.
Martin and the chairman, Mr. J. Crop
per; the last of . whom added that the
supply of flaxseed to Ireland this year
was only 10,000? casks, whereas the
usual annual supply was about 60,000.
Two petitions' against these Orders,
one to the Lords, and the other to the
Commons, were then read and unani
mously agreed to. '

London Society Finds It in die Devil-
Fish From Mexico.
Strange are the pets that London
fashion compels its followers to keep,
and various as they' are strange. A
new Cuban poodle was the rage a few
months back. A special canary fol
lows. Now it is a flsh again, and the
strangest of fish at that. The goldfish
'will have to look to its laurels, other
wise it will most certainly be super
seded in popularity by the devilfish, a
most quaint looking reptile, for which,
a leading dealer states, there have been
Innumerable demands of late.
The real home of this fish is Mexico,
and owing to Its being somewhat rare
the cost of a devilfish Is considerably
higher than that of the goldfish, x whlch
can be bought for a few pence, whi^f
the price of its rival varies from-iiVe
to ten shillings. A curious character-;
istic of the devilfish is that it almost
Invariably remains at the bottom of its
bowl or tank, and* it is most unusual
to see It swimming about. Unlike its
golden-scaled relation, it does not de
mand a frequent change of water in
its home, but will live quite well in the
same water for weeks together, while
Its taste in the matter of food is not
hard to please, for a devilfish likes
nothing better than a very small worm.
As a general rule London dealers sell
these flsh by pairs.â London Mail. ..

The accident occurred Just after
Professor Slate left the club, where he
had been spending the evening. He
failed to see a curbing that skirts the

it, with the result stated.
BERKELEY. March 26. â As the re
sult of ah accident in San. Francisco
Thursday night Professor Frederick
Slate, professor of physics and dean of
the College of Natural Sciences at the
University of California, underwent an
operation at St. Luke's Hospftal yes
terday, the purpose being to save, if
possible, the sight of one eye, which
is endangered.
Professor Slate slipped and fell
after leaving the University Club and
in striking the pavement his spectacles

had gone into both eyes, but for-
The war in East Asia is preferable
to our old friend the war cloud in the
Balkans in one respect, namely, of thÂ»
names It involves. Turkish names
were not particuarly bad, nor Ruman
ian, but those of the other lands and
peoples involved -were literalry un
speakable. For what mere Anglo-
Saxon tongue can do Justice to a name
which written displays one vowel and
sixteen consonants, and spoken resem
bles nothing' so much as three coughs
and a sneeze? In East Asia there 13.
of course, some incursion of Russian
barbarities of speech. But so far as
Japan, Korea and China are con
cerned, all is pretty easy writing and
speaking. Short names, abounding in
melodious vowels and liquid conso
nants, make the local nomenclature a
thing of beauty and a joy.
In so far as the names in question
are at all perplexing 1 , the circum
stance is due to outside perversity.
The variorum editions ef some of the
simplest and most musical names are
little short of distracting to even the
most philosophic mind. The seesaw
of "Corea" and "Korea" we can en
dure,, through long habituation. But
what shall be said of the. name of the
capital of that country? "We were
brought up to write it "Seoul." But
some of our neighbors persist in spell
ing It "Seul." Others aver that "Soul"
is the only proper form. Still others
are satisfied with nothing but "Sul."
And now here comes an estimable au
thority with the assurance that we
shall not know salvation unless we
write It "Seyool." In such case, what
are we to do? Call it "Constanti
nople" and go on to the next word?
Well, the next Is Manchuria, What!
Oh, "well, "Manchoorla," If you please;
or "Manchouria," if you prefer; or
"Mantchuria," if you like that better;
or "Mantchooria." if you insist upon
it; or "Mantchouria," If you won't be
happy until you get it- All six forms
are in use, and, for all we know, half
a dozen 'more. Then there is Mouk
den. There are those who regard with
pity those who know not "Mukden."
and also those who are prepared to
maintain "Mookden" against all the^
world. Nor does the Amoor escape.*
Some insist that It Is the "Amour,"
while others with equal confidence
proclaim It the "Amur." Of course,
too, there is the Yalu. or Yaloo; and
also the Sungarl, or Soongari; like
: wise Chefoo, or Chifoo, or Chefu, or
Chifu; not to mention Tokio, or
Tokyo, and Fusan. or Foo-San, andâ
but that way. madness lies.
It Is probably useless to protest
against such vagaries. There is no
positive authority upon these names.
since the Chinese and Japanese origi
nals are not spelled with letters, but
are expressed with ideographs. Each
man will insist on interpreting them
as he pleases; and our elastic lan
guage makes it possible to express the
same sound. with "oo," or "ou." or
long "u." Where, however, such pos
sibility of diversity exists, with sub
stantial indifference among the va
rious forms, it is a great pity that
uniformity cannot be agreed upon ami
stuck to. When the world has for
many years been accustomed to write
"Seoul." and "Soul," and "Sul" and
"Seyool?" Granted that these also
j express the game identical sound with
j equal exactness, they do it no better
. than the old form did and does; and
i there is no use in discarding an old
and familiar thing for a new an1
Â¦ strange one, unless something ia to
j be gained by the change. â New York

The finding of a strong btrx with
$124 25 hidden under the steps of the
home of Joseph Keck, a young Frutt
vale painter, led to his arrest on a
charge of robbery, as well as that of
his 13-year-old stepbrother, A. Blum.
The store of A. Berat was robbed about
8:30 o'clock last night and the box, con
taining nearly $500, was stolen. The)
finding of It with part of the money
to-day was deemed sufficient warrant
for the arrest of the pair.
Rerat conducts a grocery at Four
teenth street and Frultvale avenue.
Last night he went to lodge and left
his wife andÂ«their boy in charge of the
store. Mrs. Rerat went into a neigh
bor's to talk and the boy ttaa left
alone. Young Blum came along and
began a conversation with young Rerat
and the two went out on to the side
walk and while they were talking the
box was stolen.
Â¦When the theft "was discovered thÂ«
matter was reported to Constables Car
roil and Dearborn, who this morning
secured a search warrant to go into
Keek's home, the presence of young
Blum giving them an Idea that per
haps he had been "stalling" for Keck.
They searched the house through and
were about to leave, when they looked
back as they went down some steps
and saw the box.
A number of robberies have taken
place in the Frultvale district of late
and Carrol] and Dearborn give it as
their belief that the two they have In
custody are responsible for them. In
Keek's pocket was found a bankbook
with about $600 to his account in the
Oakland Bank of Savings. Both Keck
and Blum deny any knowledge of the
affair.

Nealon, with City Attorney McElroy
and Attorney Hughes of San Fran
cisco, met Assessor Dalton and Dis
trict Attorney Allen this morning and
had a spirited debate over the ques
tion, which Dalton finally ended by re
ferring to District Attorney Allen for
an official opinion, with the declaration
that he will seize the horses In case
the District Attorney's opinion is favor
able to his contention and Nealon still
refuses to pay his taxes.
James Nealon. ex-Assessor of San
Francisco, and County Assessor Dalton
of Alameda County have had a 'clash
over the assessment of the race horses
belonging to Nealon at the Emeryville
racetrack, and it Is believed that there
is a~well laid plan among the horse
men to try to evade the payment of
taxes on their horses; that Nealon Is
.simply acting for a large number and
is making a test case. He claims that
his horses should be assessed in San
Francisco, while Dalton states that the
horses were in Alameda County at noon
on the first Monday in March and he
asserts that should such a rule pre
vail as contended for by Nealon, when
the horses scatter after the race meet
ing is over none of them will ever be
taxed, as they will not in all proba
bility reach their home stables for a
year.

The history of this prehistoric egg
will soon be published in the form of a
bulletin at the university. Just now
the efforts of the scientists are directed
toward discovering its age and species.
Dr. Morgan told all about the discov
ery of the origin of bitumens via this
patriarch of the egg family this even
ing at a meeting of the California sec
tion of the American Chemical Society.
His subject was "A Peculiar Occurrence
of Bitumen and Evidence as to Its Ori
gin." In the course of his story Dr.
Morgan explained that he had picked
out particles of bitumen from the egg,
thus proving that it is of animal origin.
He said in part:
Hardly any scientific question has been de
bated more vigorously than that as to the
origin of bitumens, especially sine* the In
dustry has assumed such Industrial import
ance. Natural gas. liquid petroleum and solid
asphalt are universally admitted to have been
derived from a common source, their existence
in these varied forms to-day being due part y
to a process of natural separation and partly
to chemical changes wrought by water, air,
heat and pressure.
One theory ascribes to them a purely chem
ical origin Steam acting on various metals
or carbides hypothetlcally existing in the In
terior of the earth Is thought by some to be
an adequate source for all bituminous matter,
the process being similar to the interaction of
water and calcium carbide used to generate
acetylene. Most investigators prefer to be
lieve that all bodies of this nature are de
rived from an organic origin, one group holding
that vegetable, another that animal are the
source. .
Experiments have been made In the labor
atory or factory either with the view of sup
porting a particular theory or In some cases
in the hope that a cheap method of manu
facturing petroleum might be discovered. From
fish oil and again from linseed oil. distilled
under pressure, substances have been obtained
so similar to natural oils as to be indistin
guishable Xn one instance the product was
sold on the market. This experiment can be
made to support almost any hypothesis.
Under these circumstances much time and
thought have been expended In the endeavor
to ascertain whether unquestioned evidence
could not be obtained to ehow from what Hind
of matter natural deposits have been derived.
Hitherto while many things have pointed In
one direction or anoth/r. there haa always been
two Bides to the question as to the origin of
any particular deposit and evidence in â¢up
port of both sides. The discovery of a fossil
egg partly filled with asphalt. In which all
evidence points unequivocally to the fact that
the asphalt has been derived from the natural
contents of the egg. Is considered of great
scientific value. Inasmuch as it is the first
case in which the kind of matter from which
bituminous matter has actually been formed
can be definitely proven. 81nce an egg con
tains in concentrated form material like that
constituting animal tissue the actual deriva
tion of bitumen from animal remains by a
natural process Is thus proven. This fact does
not mean necessarily that some petroleum h.ns
not been derived from other sources than ani
mal matter, however.
The egg with which these experiments
were made was fo'und imbedded In a
rock on the cliffs that line the Glla
River In Arizona. It was Incased In a
mold of rock that has been preserved
along with it, the whole being not .un
like a meerschaum pipe and its velvet
case. The shell is still there, but' the
contents have undergone various
ical changes, so that they now resemble
a rock of crystal. No detectable
changes are to be found on the surface
of the shell, which, for all the scientists
are able to make out, is just the same
as that of the common duck's egg of
the present day.
As to the age of the egg, the scien
tists are not yet agreed. That is a
question that is still being discussed by
them. The hitch is over the geological
age in which the egg was .laid. Some
think it may have been born during
the quartenary period, anywhere from
16,000 to 50,000 years ago. Others think
It is of the tertiary period, estimated
recently. by. Professor A. C. Lawson to
be 2,700,000 years ago. Just think of an
egg 2,700,000 years old! Whew! What
if it should break!
Through the prehistoric egg now at
the University of California the scien
tists have been able to prove the origin
of bitumens, a thing that has puzzled
more investigators and aroused more
antagonisms than almost anything else
in the scientific world. Recent analyses
of its contents by Dr. William Conger
Morgan of the chemistry department of
the university go to show that bitumen
is actually derived - from animal re
mains that nature has changed In the
course of ages to its present composi
tion.

unable to rally and slowly sank until
to-night, when he died.
The death is the more pad because
of the fact that Lester was the sole

It is well known that branches and
buds can be grafted not only on tho
same but even on different species of
trees, but few are aware that youns
fruit of certain species can be grafted
en woody boughs called to nourish
them. A Duchesse d'Angouleme pear,
for example, taken from the native tres
at the time when the young fruit re
quired "thinning out," was grafted on
a year-old twig of another tree by th 1 *
method known as grafting "under tha
bark." Professor Courtof 3 and M. Du
voire of Beauvais dr.cribe the process
as follows: The twij,*. or bough, was
cut to a length of four or five centi
meters and the bark slit lengthwise.
The stalk of the pear was thea flat
tened so as to pass under the bark at
the slit and the whole bound with
raphia and gummed with mastic. Ths
loss of sap on the part cf the Cruit
caused in the grafting delayed its rip
.ening and diminished its size, but the
Investigators will continue their experi
ments under different conditions ani
with other varieties of fruits. They
would be pleased if other nortlcultur
ista would also try the method. If 1c
turns out a practical success it win b i
valuable, to gardeners, because the ex
cess of'^aun? fruit on some trees, cow
lost tn "thinning out." might be grafted
on other trees able to nourish them.â

tuc latter part of the session sentiment sud
denly changed and extensive liquidation set
In. The selling was due in part to an Im
pression that little harm would come to the
growing plant as a result cf the sudden
chanzes in temperature and partly because of
a desire amoug local scalpers to even ud over
Suncay. Offerinrs met with little demand and
In consequence the market weakened percepti

any particular weakni?s?. A member of the
firm, rpeaklng of th^ decline in futures, said:
"A bear element is raiding the May option
ar.d helping tt down by selling the cash grain
lower. Ttie market went down through lack of
support, there being no buying orders of any
consequence. Eut either the May option must
advance or the spot* market decline, for there

them."
There was no further news regarding Orien

DRIED FRUITS.
Nezu York Grain and Produce.
All markets under this head closed the
week easy and quiet. Butter was in ample
supply and featureless. Dealers said that at
about 20c the north would take large lines, but
wanted very little at pr?Â«ent quotations. Re
eelpts from Humboldt are rapidly Increasing
and the situation is likely to develop more
weakness from now on.
The situation in Cheese remains the same.
There is eo life to the market.
The Esz market was extremely unsettled
yestenlay. Some houses, fearing a slump in
Quotations next week, let their best ranch go
at 20c and thus cleared off their floors. Others
were willing to do this, but could not End the
buyer*. Â£â¢ till others refused to make any con
cessions and reported business at 22c, and in
several instances even over this figure. It was
reported that one large house had brought down
from Petaluma all of the EÂ£gs It had bought
for storing during the past week and had
TJlaced them on this market for sale. Other
houses reported a very steady market for store
Eggs and said that the store goods quoted at
lHc were rot store Eggs at all, but culls,
small, dark-colored and muddy ranch Eggs,
masquerading as store E^rgs. One could get al
most iiny kind of a yarn he wanted about the
market yesterday. As a matter of fact, there
was not much chans? in the situation. One
thing was certain â there was no scarcity of
Eggs.
Receipts were 4^.900 lbs Butter, HS1 cases

Poultry ruled firm at previous prices, rs
ceipts being very light and the market was
bare at the close. Receipts of domestic rtoci
have been very light during the past few days
owing Â¦ to the bad condition of the country
roads, which prevented deliveries at shipping
points. The car of Western expected on
Thursday did not arrive until late yesterday
and was held over for Monday's market, when
another car falls due. .The scarcity of Poultry
caused a better demand for Game, and the
light receipts cleaned up quickly at higher
prices. â¢ > ';

be incorporated, such as an auditorium,

PHYSICAL TRAINING
OP THIS JAPANESE
A System That lias Bern In Vogue
2300 Years Has Wrought
Wonders ,Therc
The belief in physical training has
really been a matter of quite modern
growth in England, but as it was slow
to come, it came with a rush. For
we seem to have been taken with a
positive mania for physical training,
and there is as much danger of our
overdoing it as there was of neglect
ing what we know to be essential to
health. Let us take a lesson from thÂ«i
hardy little Jap, who is the embodi
ment of "wiriness" and who seems in
capable of fatigue, though his sus
tenance is only a few grains of rice.
The Japanese have practiced a sys
tem of physical exercise for over 2500
years and to this Is due the splendid
physique which enables them to with
stand fatigue. They have been called
the "healthiest, strongest and happiest
men and women in the world"; and
the credit for this must be given to
jiu-jitsu, the system referred to.
There are no less than six aifferent
systems of jiu-jitsu, but every one is
based on diet and the healthy state of
the body. Every muscie is brought
into development and hardening by
the system, which means "muscle
breaking" â a term that^does " not ex
press the fact. Four years are need
ed for the full development of the
system; years of regular, patient prac
tice and gradually the pupil begins to
feel its. influence. The most Interest
ing part is that which deals with the
daily habits of the student of jiu
jitsu.
Twice a day he will bathe, If he
would imitate his Japanese teachers;
a gallon of pure water will be con
sumed during the twenty-four hours
and he will 'eat no meat Rice comes
first in importance as an element of
diet; next come vegetables, fish and
fruit, meat being scarcely ever used.
Fresh air, naturally, is absolutely es
sential not only to jiu-jitsu, but to
good health and vigor In Japan as
elsewhere, and a special study is made
of the Influence of deep breathing
upon the student.
But -what will surprise most people
is ' that something . mostly needed be
yond all" these â equanimity of tem
per-^s essential. The. reason of this
is that there are too many tricks,
which are dangerous to life and limb,
to be . Intrusted to a person whose
pasions might- overpower his Judg
ment. â Black and White.

?After years of waiting, hoping and
planning, the reconstruction of the
king's iiighway from mission to mission
through Â«he State is at last in a fair
way to be realized. Where a few years
sÂ£o si?oradic interest was manifested
}n the movement of the restoration of
ihe missions and the correlative move
ment of reconstructing the roads that
Joined thrrc together, organizations and
communities are now bending their ef
forts toward the patriotic work, and
euf eess willâ mustâ follow if every Cal
ifornisn rallies to the cause as befits

of Htate.'of our devotion to her devel
<y?ment and reputation; now let's prove
It by doing for California that which

peere; not only in the West, but in the
najtion r {or nowhere In the United
States is there a possibility of such a
read as that of the pastoral period in

beauty of -the matter is that a goodly
proportion of the historical old road
'exists to-Â£ay as county roads.
