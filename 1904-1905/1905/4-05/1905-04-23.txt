Gordon went rapidly through me wall
grate to the whorf where he had first
set foot on the island. His own gon
dola, battered and tcssing, lay there.
He stopped abruptly, (or he recog
nized a ng;ure standing by it, blue-coat
ed, bareheaded, his long hair stream
ing in the wind. It was Shelley. His
hand was outstretched, and with a
quick movement Gordon strode forward
and took it. A swift glance passed
between the troubled, hollow eyes un
der the graying hair, and foe clear,
wild blue ones. Shelley's held no re
proach, only comprehension.
"Fletcher told me where to find you,"
he said: "you must forgive him."
"Where is the child?"
"In the convent of Bagnacavallo,
near Ravenna."
â¢"Andâ Jane?" us now in Pisa."
"She is with us now in Pisa."
A question he could not ask hung on
Gordon's lips as the other added:
"She is Froinff to America with a
troupe of players."
She no longer, wished the child, then!
Allegra might be his. His, to care for,
to teach to leve him, to come in time
to fill a part r maybe, of that void in
his heart which had ached so con
stantly for Ada, further from him now
than any distance measurable by
leagues! ; . '
He looked again at the scrap of pa
per still in his , hand, heedless of the
wind that tore at his robe and lashed
him with spume plucked from the tun
neled waves like spilt milk from a
pan. Why had it come at just that
moment to stay his leap into the here
after? Was there, after all, deeper
than its apparent fatalism, an obscure
purpose in what man calls chance?
Was this daughter, born out of the
pale as he himself was beyond the pale,
to give him the comfort all else con
spired to deny? A slender hope grew
tendril-like in him.

the monastery, he leaped into the gon

iding, a thought came that made
him start. He crossed himself and
hastened out of the room.
A few moments later he was at the
wharf. The gondola was gone, but
by the shrine he found what Gordon
had left.
He lifted the silver crucifix that
hung at his girdle and his lips moved
audibly:
"Oh thou who quieted the tempest!"
he prayed in his native tongue. "Thou
didst send this racked heart to me in
thy good purpose. Have I failed in
aught toward him? Did I, in my
blindness, offer him less than thy com

more minister to him and that

CHAI'TKR XXXIII.
The Passing of Jane Clermont.
The storm clouds were gone. An
Italian spring was painting the hills
with April artistry. Myrtle hedges had
waked to childish green, lusty creepers
swung callow tendrils, meadows were
afire with the delicate, trembling ane
mone, and the rustling olive copses
were a silver firmament of leaves.
The immemorial pine woods that
stretched about Ravenna, with the
groves and rivers which Boccaccio's
jen had made forever haunted, were
bathed in sun and noisy with winged
creatures.
Under the boughs of the balsamic
forest, through the afternoon, from
the convent of Bagnacavallo into Ra
venna, a wagonette had been driven.
It had carried a woman, young, dark-
haired and of Spanish type â she who
once had ruled the greenroom of the
Drury Lane. Time had made slight
change in Jane Clermont's piquant
beauty. A little deeper of tone and
fuller of lip she wa,s, perhaps a little
colder of look; but her black eyes
snapped and sparkled with all their
old daring.
The convent road met the high
way on the skirt of the town. At
the juncture sat a prosperous osteria
half surrounded by trellised arbors,
blowey with yellow snapdragons and
gilliflowers, and bustling all day
long with the transient travel
of tourists, to whom Ravenna
with its massive clusters of wide
eaved houses and dun-colored
t hurches, its few streets of leisurely
business, its foliaged squares and its
colonnaded opera-house, were of less
interest than the tomb of Dante.. The
held a commanding position. The
â oad that passed its door curved
ward toward Pisa; northward it
! <-d to Venice. From both di

:ic* and chaise.
At the osteria the wagonette halted,
made a detour and was finally drawn
up in the shadow of the arbors, where
it was unobserved from the inn and
. .d a screened view of both roads,
hours the vehicle sat there while
the driver dozed, the occupant nesting
â in in her gloved hand and from
time to time restlessly shifting her po-

TWO men on horseback had paused at

h rough the 6creen of silver
twigs. "I thought he would. I won
der what he will say when he finds
I have changed my mind and settled
Allfgra's afTiiirs another way."
She watched the pair as they
parted. The drooping sun danced in
tiny flashes from the brass buttons on
Shelley's blue coat. "Poor philoso
pher!" she soliloquized with pitying
tolerance. "You are going back to
your humdrum Pisa, your books and
your Mary. The world attracts you
no more now with your money than
it did when we found you in the
debtors' prison. Well, every one to
his taste! 1 wonder why you always
trouMed yourself about George Gor
don."
Her eyes narrowed as they lingered
on the other figure, turning alone into
the forest road from which her
wagonette had come.
"I would like to see your lordship's
face when you get there!" she sail
half a?oud. "My authority is the
convent's now. You may take your
daughter â if you canJ" *
Not till both riders were out of sight
did the wagonette draw into the high
way.
iÂ« .Clermont rode on, humming
an air, looking curiously at the vari
ous vehicles that passed her on the
smooth, well-traveled road, thinking
with triumph of the man she had seen
riding to Bagrnacavallo. She had
gaiessed the object of Shelley's trip to
Venice, but th,e knowledge had not at
first stirred her natural and self-ab
sorbed indifference. It was a ma
licious afterthought, a gratuitous
spice of venom springing more from
an instinctive maleficence than from
any deeper umbrage that had inspired
that parting visit to the convent. The
impulse that had led her to assure
herself of Gordon's fruitless journey
was distinctly feline.
A mile from the town her reflec
tions were abruptly broken. She spoke
to the driver and he stopped.
A sweating horse was approaching.
Its trappings were of ostentatious
gaudiness. The face of the man it
tarried was swarthy and mustachioed
and his bearing had the effect of:
flamboyant and disordered bragga
docio.
"Trevanion!" she exclaimed with
an accent of surprise. She had not
seen him for two years. As eshe
watched her face showed a certain
amusement.
He would posaibly have passed her
by, for his gaze was set straight ahead,
but when he came opposite she leaned
from the carriage and spoke his name.
His horse halted instantly; a hot
red leaped into his Oriental cheeks, a
look fierce and painful into his Ryes.
He sat still, looking at her without a
word.
"I thought you were in England,"
he said at length.
1 whs till last fall. Since. I'vo
been at Pisa with the Shelleys. But
I find the Continent precious dull. I
see you haven't been caught yet for
deserting from the navy. Is that why
you don't stay in London? Tell me,"
she asked suddenly; "where is George
Gordon now?"
"In Venice."
"Really!" Her voice had a kind of
measured mockery that did not cloak
its satire. "And yet I hear of his do
ings in many other places â Lucca, Bo
logna, all the post towns. From the
descriptions. I judge he has changed,
not only in looks but in habits."
He winced and made no reply.
"Pshaw!" phe said, scorn suddenly
showing. "Don't you think I guessed?
Gulling a few travelers in the post
houses with a brawling impersona
tion! Suppose a million should think
George Gordon the tasteless roust
about ruffian you make him out?
What do you gain? One of these days
some tourist friend of his â Mr. Hob
house, for instance; he used to be a
great travelerâ will put a sharp end to
your play."
"I'll risk that!" he threw her. "And
I'd rusk more!" T
"How you hate him!"
He laughedâ a hard, dare-devil sound.
"Haven't I cause enough?"
"Not so far as I know. But I wish
you luck, if the game pleases you. It's
nothing to me."
"It was something to you, once," he
said, "wasn't it?"
She 6miled amusedly. "How tragic
you always were! He was never more
to me than that"â she snapped her
fingers. "Constancy is too heavy a role.
1 always preferred lighter parts. I
am going to play in America. Why
don't you turn stroller and act to some
purpose? Why not try New York?"
While she spoke her tone had
changed. It had become softer, more
musical. Her laches drooped with well
gauged coquetry.
' Look," she said, in a lower key; "am
I as handsome as I used to be at Drury
Lane â when you said you'd like to see
the world with me?"
A smoldering fire kindled in his eyes
as he gazed at her. He half leaned
from the saddle â half put out his hand.
But at his movement she dropped the
mask. She laughed in open scorn. "A
fig for your hate!" she exclaimed con
temptuously. 'I have no liking for
George Gordon, but he was never a
sneak at any rate!"
The man to whom she spoke struck
savage spurs to his horse. As he
wheeled, she swept him a curtsy from
the carriage seat. "Joe to your task!"
she cried, and drove on with her lips
curled.
"He doesn't know Gordon is near
Ravenna," she thought presently. "If
he gives one of his free entertainments
at the inn to-night, there may be an
interesting meeting. What a* pity I
shall miss it!" and she laughed.
A little further on the carriage turn
ed to the westward toward the Swiss
frontier.
As Trevanion reined the animal he be
strode to its haunches at the porch
of the osteria, where Jane Cler
mont s wagonette had waited, he
lo6ked back along the road with a
muttered curse. Then he kicked a
sleeping hound from the step and
went in with an assumed limp and
Two hours later, when the early dusk
had fallen and the ghostly disk that
had hung all day in the sky was yel

Gordon flung his bridle wearily to a
groom at the inn. His face was set
and thwarted. He had been to the
convent, to find that a wall had sud

session of his child. To surmount this
wauld mean publicity, an appeal tc

Italian delays â perhaps failure then.
As he stood listening to the stir o:
the inn he was about to enter, a low
voice suddenly spoke from the shadow
of a hedge: ''Excellence:"
Turning he recognized the huge
frame of the gondolier who had borne
Teresa from the Piazza San Marco on
the night she had come to warn him-
His heart leaped into his throat. Had
the man followed him from Venice?
Did he bring a message from her?
"Excellence ! I heard in the town
that you were at the inn. 1 would like
speech with you, but I must not be
seen. Will you follow me"
Even in his surprise Gordon felt an
instant's wonder. He himself had not
yet entered the osteria. How had the
other heard of his presence? The won
der, however, was lost in the thought
of Teresa.
He turned from, the inn and followed
the figure silently through the falling
shadows.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
Tita Intervenes.
Under the trees, as Gordon listened
to the gondolier, the night grew.deep
er. The moonlight that mellowed over
the pine forests spectrally outspread,
the burnished river and the town be
fore them, misted each hedge and tree
with silver. A troubadour nightingale
bubbled in the middle distance from
some palazzo garden and from the
nearer osteria came sounds of bustle.
Through all breathed the intimate soft
wind of the south bearing the smell
of lime blossoms and of sleeping bean
fields.
Wonder at Tita's appearance had
melted into a great wave of gladness
that swept him at the sudden knowl
edge that she, Teresa, was there in
Ravenna near him, mistress of Casa
Guiccioli, whose very portal he had
passed that afternoon. But the Joy
had died speedily; thereafter every
word had seemed to burn itself into
his heart.
"If he hated her why did he wish to
make her his contessa? Tell me that,
Excellence! It has been so all these
weeks, ever since her wedding. Some
times I have heard him sneer at her â
always about you, Excellence â how he

know she ever saw you I cannot tell!
His servants go spyingâ spying, al
ways when she is out of the casa."
The man who listened turned his
head with a movement of physical
pain, as Tita went on resentfully:
"And she is a Gamba, born to be a
great lady! If she left him he would
bring her back unless she went from
Italy. And who is to help her do that?
Her brother is in another land. Her
father is sick and she will not tell him
anything. There is none but me in
Casa Guiccioli who does not serve the
signore too well! I thoughtâ" he fin
ished, twisting his red can in his great
fingers, "I thoughtâ if I told youâ you
would take her away from him, to
your own country, maybe."
Gordon almost smiled in his anguish.
To the simple soul of this loyal serv
ant, on whom conventional morals sat
with Italian lightness, here was an un
complex solution! Turn household
highwayman and fly from the States
of the church to enjoy the plunder!
And of all placesâ to England! Open
a new domestic chapter In some pro
vincial British countryside as "Mr.
Smith," perhaps, "a worthy retired
merchant of Lima!" The bitter hu
mor couched in the fancy made sharper
his pang of utter impotence. Italy
was not England, he thought grimly.
In that very difference had lain ship
wreck for them both. Teresa could not
leave her husband openly as Annabel
had left him! The church of Rome
knew no divorce and inside its bond
only a papal decree could give her the
right to live apart from her husband
under her own father's roof.
Tita's voice spoke again eagerly:
"You will come, Excellence? The sig
nore is from Ravenna now at one of
his estates in Romagna â you can see
her! None shall know If you come
with me. You will, Excellence?"
To see her again! Gordon had not
realized how much it meant till to
night, when the possibility found him
quivering from his disappointment at
the convent. A stolen hour with her!
Why not? Yetâ discovery. Her hus
band's servants, spies upon her every
moment! To steal secretly to her thus
unbidden and perhaps crowd upon her
a worse catastrophe than that at San
Lazzarro.!
He shook his head. "No. Not unless
she knows I am here and bids me
come."
"I will go and tell her, Excellence!"
"Tell her I did not know she was in
Ravenna, but thatâ that I would die
to serve her. Say that!"
"You will wait here, Excellence?"
"Yes."
Tita swung round and disappeared.
It seemed an immeasurable time that
Gordon waited, striding fiercely up and
down, listening to every sound. At the
inn a late diligence had unloaded its
contingent of chattering tourists for the
night. He could hear phrases spoken in
English. The words bore a myriad
voiced suggestion, yet how little their
appeal meant to him at that moment!
All England, save for Ada, was less to
him then than a single house there in
Ravennaâ and a convent buried in the
forest under that moon. On such an
other perfect day and amber night, he
thought, he had found Teresa's minia
ture and had fled with Jane Clermont.
Now substance and shadow had re
placed one another. To-day Jane had
touched his life vaguely and painfully
in passing from it! Teresa was the sole
reality. What would she say? What
word would Tita bring?
Long as It seemed, it was in fact less
than an hour before the gondolier stood
apraln before him.
fen minutes inter they were In the
streets of the town, avoiding its lighted
thoroughfares, walking swiftly, Tita in
the lead. At length, threading a lane
between walled gardens flanking great
houses whose fronts frowned on wider
avenues, they stood before a columned
gate. This Gordon's guide unlocked.
"I will watch here," he said. "You
will not tell her I came to you first of
my own thoughts, Excellence?" he
added anxiously.
"I will not tell her," answered Gor
don.
He entered with a loudly beating
heart.
CHAPTER XXXV.
In the Casa Garden.
The close was stillâ only the flutter
ot moths and the splash of a fountain
tinkling wetly. Here and there in the
deeper shades of cloisteral walks the
moonlight, falling through patches of
young leaves, flecked bloodless bac
chantes and bronze Tritons nestling
palely in shrub tangles of mimosa. This
was all Gordon distinguished at first as
he moved, his hands before him, his
feet feeling their way on the cool
sward.
Suddenly a low breath seemed to
pierce the stillness. A sense of near
ness rushed upon him. His arm, out
stretched,; touched something yielding.
"Teresa!" he cried, and his handa
found hers and drew her close to him.
In that first moment of silence he was
keenly conscious of her breath against
his cheek, hurried and warm.
"I knowâ l know," he said in choked
voice. "Tita toul me all I would give
my body Inch by inch, my blood drop
by drop to give back to your life what
I have taken from it!"
She shook her head. "You have taken
nothing from it. Before that night on
the square it held nothingâ l have
learned that since."
She was feeling a sense of expecta
tion. Since the day at San Lazarro
she had never expected to see him
again. To her he had been a glorious
spirit, struggling for lost foothold on
the causeways of redemption. In her
mental picture he had stood always
as she had seen him on the monastery
path, pale, clad in a monk's coarse
robe, the vesture of earthly penance.
This picture had blotted out his past,
whatever it had been, whatever of ru
mor was true or false, whatever she
may for a time have believed. Every
word he had spoken remained a living
iterate memory. And the thought that
her hand had drawn him to his better
self had filled her with a painful ec
stasy.
"Teresa," he said unsteadily, "I long
ago forfeited every right to hope and
happiness. And if this were not true,
by a tie that holds me, and by a bond
you believe in, I have still no right to
stand here now. But fate drew me here
to-day â as it drew me to you that
morning at La Mira. It is stronger
than I â stronger than us both. Yet I
have brought you nothing but mis
ery!"
"You have brought me much more
than that," she Interrupted.' "I knew
nothing of life when I met you. I have
learned It now as you must have known
it to write as you have. I know that It
is vaster than I ever dreamed â more
sorrowful, but sweeter, too."
A stone bench showed near, wound
with moonbeams, and she sat down,
making room beside her. In the, white
light she seemed unrealâ a fantasy in
wild-rose brocade. A chain of dull gold
girdled her russet hair, dropping a sin
gle emerald to quiver and sparkle on
her forehead. Her face was pale, but
with a shadowy something born of
those weeks.
What he saw there was awakened*,
self-reliance and mettle, the birthright
of clean inheritance. The wedding gon
dola that had borne a girl to San La
zarro had carried back a woman, re
bellious, agonized, flushed to every
nerve. She had opposed a woman's
pride to the hatred that otherwise
would have made the ensuing time a
slow unrolling nightmare; had taken
her place passively as mistress of the
gloomy casa with its atmosphere of
cold grandeur and miserliness, thank
ful that its host was niggardly of en
tertainment, enduring as best she
might the petty persecution with which
the old count surrounded her. His an
ger, soured by the acid sponge of jeal
ousy, had fed itself daily with this bait
ing. He believed sne had come
smirched from the very altar to his
name and place. Yet he had no proof,
and to make the scandal publicâ to put
her away â would have seared his pride,
laid hfm open to the wrath of her kin.
brought her brother back" to Italy to
avenge the slight upon their house,
and, most of all to be dreaded, would
have necessitated the repayment of her
dowry. A slow and secret satisfaction
was all he had, and under it her spirit
had galled and chafed him. In this
strait she had had no confidant, for
her father, aging rapidly and failing,
she would not sadden, and whenever
he drove to Casa Guiccioli from his
villa, some miles from the townâ sole
relic of his wasted propertiesâ had
striven to conceal all evidence of un
happiness. Even when she had deter
mined on a momentous step â a secret
appeal to the papal court for such a
measure of freedom as was possible â
she had determined not to tell him yet
Grief and repression had called to the
surface the latent capabilities which
in the girl hud been but promises, and
these spoke now to Gordon in a beauty
strong, eager and far-divining.
"What I have known of life is not
its sweets," he answered in bitterness.
"I have gathered its poison-flowers and
their perfume clings to the life I live
now."
"But it will not be so," she said ear
nestly. 'I believe mo-re than you told
mt at La Miraâ when you said it had
been one of, your faults that you had
never justified yourself. You were
never all they said. Something tells
me that. If you did evil it was not
because you chose it or took pleasure
in it. For a while I doubted every
thing, but that day at San Lazzarro,
when I saw you â the moment you
spoke â it came back to me. No mat
ter what I might think or hear again,
in my heart I should always believe
that now!"
He put out his hand, a gesture of
hopelessness and protest. His mind
was crying out against the twin im
placables, time and space. If man
could but push back the now to then,
enweave the there and here! If in
such a reformed universe he and she
might this hour be standingâ no ir
revocable past, only the new now!
What might not life yield up for him.
of its burgeoning, not of its corrup
tion. Its hope, not ot its despair!
"That day!" he repeated. "I saw you
In the gondola. I would have spared
you that meeting."
"Yet that was what told me. If I
had not seen you there â " She paused.
The chains of his repression clung
about him like the load of broken
wings. The knowledge that had come
as he walked the floor of his monas
tery-room with the burn of a blow on
his forehead had spelled abnegation.
She must never know the secret he car
ried â must in time forget .her own.
Once out he could never shackle It
again. He completed her sentence:
"You would have forgotten the soon
er."
"I should never .have forgotten," she
said softly.
He was silent. He dared not look
at her face, but he saw her hands,
outstretched, clasping her knee.
Presentlyâ he could not guess the
dear longing for denial that made her
tone shake now! â she said:
"Tita. told me thatâ when you came
to Ravenna â you had not known â "
He rose to his feet, feeling the chains
weakening, the barriers of all that
had lain unspoken, yet not unfelt,
burning away.
"It was true." he answered, confront
ing her. "I did not know it. But if
I had known all I know to-night I
would have crossed seas and mountains
to come to you: Now that I have seen
youâ what can I do? Teresa! Teresa!'
The exclamation TiÂ«?ld trenchant pain
â something; else, too, that for the life
of him he could not repress. It pierced
her with a darting rapture.
Since that hour at the monastery,
with its pang and its reassurance, as
she felt budding those new, mysteri
ous flowers of faith and heart experi
ence, she had felt a deeper unguessed
want. Over and ever she had repeat
ed to herself the last words he had said
before that painful interruption: "Be
cause it was a prayer of yours for me."
Her soul had been full of a vague,
unphwsed yearning for all the mean
ings that might lie unexpressed in the
coupling of those two words. So now
as she heard him speak her name in
that shaken accent her heart thrilled.
"Ah," she breathed, "then you care â
so much?"
His fingers clenched. He was torn
with two emotions: Self-abasement and.
a hungry desire, lashed by propinquity,
to take her in his arms, to defy vow
and present, be the consequence what
it might. There came upon him again
the feeling that had gripped him when
she stood with him among the circling
maskers. violet-eyed, lilac-veined,
bright with new impulses, passionate
and lovely. He leaned toward her. If
she but knew how he cared!
A sound startled them both. Her
hand grasped his with apprehensive
fingers as she listened. "Look! TherÂ«
beyond the hedge. A shadow moved."
He looked. Only an acacia stirred in
the light air.
"It is nothing," he reassured her.
"Tita is at the gate."
"Oh," she said fearfully, "I ahoul<f
cot have said come. There la risk
for you here."
"What would I not have risked?"
"Listen!"
Aaother sound came to both now, the
pounding of horses' hoofs, borne over
the roof from the streetâ the rumble
of heavy coach wheels. It ceased all
at once and lights sprang into windows
across the shrubbery.
She came to her feet as Tita hurried
toward them. "It Is the slgnore, "
warned the gondolier.
"Dio mio!" she whispered- *'Go â go
quickly!"
He caught her hands. "If only I
could help you, serve you!"
"You can," she said hurriedly. "I
have a letter on which much depends
â for the Contessa Albrizzi at Venice.
I cannot trust a messenger."
"It shall start to-night."
"It is in my room. I will send it
after you by Tita. Ahâ hasten!"
He bent and touched his lips to a
curl that had blown like lltten gold
against her shoulder. Her eyes met
his' an instant in fluttering, happy con
fusion. Then, as he followed Tita
quickly to the gate, she turned and
ran toward the house.
She had not seen a man, crouched In
the shadow of a hedge, who had hur
ried within doors to greet the master
of the casa so unexpectedly returned.
She did not see the rage that colored
her husband's shrunken cheeks in hi 3
chamber as Paolo, his Corsicsm secre
tary, imparted to him two pieces of in
formation: The presence of the stran
ger in the garden .and the arrival that
afternoon at the osteria of him Venice
called "the wicked milord."
The old Count pondered with shak
ing fingers. He hated the Englishman
of Venice; hated him for robbing him
of the youth and beauty he had gloat
ed over, for the arrow to his pride â
with a hatred that had settled deeper
each day, fanatical and demented. The
story of the garden trespasser inspired
now an unholy craving for reprisal,
unformed and but half conceived. He
summoned his secretary.
In a few moments more â a half-hour
after Teresa's letter had started on its
way to the innâ his coach, with its six
white horses, bearing Paolo, and fol
lowed by four of the casa servants
afoot, was being driven thither by a
roundabout course.
CHATTER XXXVI.
The Face at the Window.
The osteria. as Gordon approached,
seemed gurgling with hilarity. At ita
side the huge unhitched diligence
yawned, a dark bulk waiting for the
morrow's journey. Some of the pas
sengers it had carried were gathered on
the porch before the open windows list
ening, with postures that Indicated a
more than ordinary curiosity and in
terest, to sounds from the taproom.
There were women's forms among
them.
Tourists were little to Gordon's Ilk
ing. They had bombarded his balcony
at Diodatl with spyglasses, had am
bushed him at Venice when he went to
opera or ridotto. To him they stood
for the Insatiable taboo of public dls
esteemâthe chuckling fetishism that
mocked him still, from beyond blue
water. He skirted the Inn in the shade
of the cypresses and passed to an arbor
which the angle of the building
screened from the group.
On its edge he paused and gased out
over the fields and further forest
asleep. With what bitterness he had
ridden scarce three hours before from
those woods! Now it was shot through
with an arrow of cardinal Joy whose
very rankle was a painful delight. In
the jar of conflicting sensations he had
not reasoned or presaged; he could
only feel.
What was the import of Teresa's let
ter, he wondered. Much depended on
it, she had said in that agitated mo
ment. A thought flitted to him. The
Contessa Albrizzi had lived much in
Rome â was, he remembered, cousin to
a Cardinal. Could this message be an
appeal for deliverance from an 'mpos
sible position? Might Teresa yet be
free â not from her marriage bond, but
at least from this hourly torture in
Casa Guiccioli? With the quick feeling
of relief for her. wound a sharp sense
of personal vantage. For him that
would mean the right to see her often
and unopposed. Yet, he argued in
stantly with self-reproach, was not this
the sole right he could not possess.
then or ever? What would it be but
tempting her love on and on, only to
ka.ve it naked and ashamed at last?
A gust of noise rose behind him. It
issued from a window opening out of
the taproom into the arbor. On the,
heels of the sound he caught shattered
comments from the peering group on
the front porchâ feminine voices speak
ing English:
"I've always wanted to see hint. We
watched three whole days in Venice.
How young he looks!"
"What a monster! And to think he
is a peer and once wrote poetry. There!
See â he's looking this way!"
Gordon started and half-turned, but
he had not been observed; the angle of
the wall hid him effectually.
Just then a single vociferate voice.

A QUESTION OF INCOME
ON "butter day" little Susie Brad
](y always wiped the breakfast
dishes. She was making but lit
i!e progress with that occupa
however, by reason of run
nine tia k*uk out of the window every
few minute t. Although she took a
handful of silver, a platter or a pile of
pietes with her on each trip, wiping as
she went, she was not keeping pace
t! c help, who was washing
hee.
â¢ I vow, Susie, this is the tenth time
you have sore to that window!"
I cant wait to see her," sighed
Susie. "I am so afraid the train is
late! "
The coming of the city cousin, Kath
lyn Randall, was always an event. The
.ally occurred in strawberry
or harvest time, but what could have
induced her to come to the farm in No
vember waa beyond the combined con
bs of thr Randall family. She had
written a short note saying she would
be there that morning for a long visit.
"Can hardly wait for what, Susie?"
asked a manly voice.
Susie looked up into the handsome
face of Neil Milnes, one of the men
from tbt city who was camping down
on the river for the shooting season. It
was Neil's turn to come for the milk
and Lutjer with which Mrs. Bradley
supplied them.
"My couEin. She is coming to visit
ue; and, oh, she is so lovely and wears
such beautiful clothec!"
Milnes laughed, and walked out
through the woodshed and across
fields of stubble to join his compan
ions.
SuFie. however, had caught the
sound of distant wheels and sped
quickly away. Milnes met them rid-
Sng in the democrat, Mr. Bradley and
the luggage on the first seat, and
Susie perched proudly on the back
seat beside the most stunning looking
girl that he had ever seen. Mr. Brad
ley reined up and presented Milnes
to his niece, Miss Randall, who ac
knowledged the introduction cordially.
Then they drove on, and Milnes. re

"Here, I'll catch you," exclaimed
the Junior counsel, Blake, a somewhat
lanky, powerfully built Westerner, ris
ing and depositing hia rough brown
sack coat beside Hardy's.
"Gee! you've got muscle," he added,
rubbing his hands after the first pass.
"Hurray:" yelled the small boy.
"that was a corker. Git on to them
curves. Clarence !" he cried in worship
ful admiration.
"Wouldn't mind a little of that exer
<;sc myself." said the Judge, rising in
terestedly and hesitating on the steps.
Belle Maniates
gowned to match her eyes of sapphire,
was in the kitchen with her aunt. She
hardly vouchsafed the young man a
glance.
"Oh. Mr. Milnes, what can I do for
you?" asked Mrs. Bradley.
"Why â cr â oh, we want some more
butter," he said desperately.
"What have you done with all that
you got this morning?" she exclaimed.
"Well, you see, it's Johnson's turn
to cook, and he uses so much butter!"
Mrs. Bradley's eyes twinkled as she
got a roll of butter while Susie gig
gled outright, and he could see that
Miss Randall was amused, though she
was quite ignoring his presence. Sud
denly it came to him in a flash that
Susie had repeated his remarks. He
turned to go and Mrs. teradley said
good nauredly:
"Susie, go as far as the barn with
Mr. Milnes and show him where to
get some cider."
On the way out he asked Susie anx
iously if she had told what he said.
"oh, yeF!" she replied cheerfully.
He groaned.
'What did your cousin say?"
"She said you didn't look like such
a cad!"
He winced and was silent for a mo
ment. Then he said suddenly:
"Say, Susie, is her father's name
Wellman -Randall?"
"Yes; Uncle Wendell is her father.
He is awfully rich."
Of course he was. Every one knew
of Wellman Randall, the successful
spec ulator.
"1 am sorry," he said, Jialf to hlm
seif.
"Why?" asked Susie, indignantly.
"Uncle Wellman is lovely."
"I know he is, but I wish he were
poor."
Such a wish was beyond Susie's
understanding and she thought he
was joking. All day he loafed and
smoked by himself and thought of the
vision at the Bradleys. At twilight
he insisted that the milk was sour
and went up to the house for a fresh
supply. By good fortune Miss Ran
dall was alone in the orchard.
"Miss Randall," he said, coming up
to her, "we are all prone at times to
say utterly idle words that we don't
mean. I couldn't know that you
wereâ"
"That I was what?' she asked as he
hesitated.
"That you were the hundredth wo
man. Until I saw you I had no rea-
Bon to suppose that you were not one
of the ninety-nine. I don't wonder
you think me a cad, though!"
She blushed a little.
"I. am afraid Susie is leaky," B he
'â¢Why not have a little game while
we are waiting?" said Hardy, half jok
ingly. '"Come on. Sheriff!"
Moved by a common impulse, the
little group brightened up, threw away

vented by Mr. Bradley's appearance
upon the scene.
"Come, Kathlyn, if you want to go
with me to see the committee, we
must be starting."
"Yes, uncle. Good night, Mr. Mil
nes," and she walked away, leaving
Neil discomfited.
The next day, Sunday, the men
were away from camp fishing, save
Neil, whose turn it was to cook din
ner. W 7 hfTe in the tent he heard steps
approaching, and then a fall. Going
out, he saw Susie sprawled on the
ground by the side of a pumpkin pie.
Both were quite disturbed on the sur
face.
"Oh. dear!" sobbed Susie, "mother
took such pains, and I walked so
Blow and careful all the way."
Milnes always had a tender sym
pathy with the woes of children. He
pirked Susie up in his arms and sat
down in the hammock with her,
kissed her gently and wiped away the
rain of tears.
"See here, dear," he said, soothing
ly, "the pie is all right. We can
smooth it down, and If we can't we'll
call it pudding. You needn't tell any
one at the house, and the fellows
won't know the difference. They'll
think it is the proper style for a pie.
You stay and watch me get dinner
and help eat it, and then we'll have
a boat ride."
Susie was quickly comforted. She
was not used to being petted except
by Cousin Kathlyn, and her heart went
straight into Nell's service henceforth.
"Cousin Kathlyn is going to stay
here and teach the school; our
teacher is ill and has gone away. Isn't
that lovely?"
"What in the world is she going, to
do that for?" he asked in amazement.
"I mustn't tell. Cousin Kathlyn
told me it wasnt' nice 4.0 repeat
things."
When Kathlyn went to Susie's bed
side that night for a little visit with
her cousin she casually mentioned
Neil's name.
The child sat up in bed, her eyes
shining.
"I love him!" she cried.
"Why, Susie!"
Thereupon Susie confided the fate
of the pie and told how he had kissed
and comforted her. The next morn
ing when Nell chanced to be strolling
in the lane near the little schoolhouse
he met Kathlyn. To his surprise she
stopped and spoke to him. smiling
graciously. â¢
'"Susie told me how good you were
to her," she said.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALII
their cigar ends. and moved half apolo
getically into the sandy square. At
the left of the cotirthQuse and adjoin
ing it was a sman qpen field of well
trodden, dusty grass, where a scratch
ball game was played occasionally and
where horses were tethered during
court. One of the small boys was dis
pstched for a suitable bat and ball and
a catcher's glove, and by the time the
sides were arranged he came racing
back with them, highly excited, fol T
lowed by several other small boys.
No one had the slightest Idea of be
ing drawn into a game when he left the
"Susie's a darling!" he exclaimed,
"and say. Miss Randall, if I can help
you in the school or any way "
She laughed.
"Oh, I can manage the school all
right. I understand children."
"I shall come and see how you get
on," he declared.
He appeared in the schoolroom the
very next day and announced that he
had come to "visit." She was provoked,
but she could not turn Him out. She
had written some words on the black
board for the pupils to use in sentences.
She now pointed to the flftt one, "in
come."
"Who can make a sentence and use
that word correctly? " she asked.
"Do call on that little fat boy for a
sentence, or he'll wring his hand off,"
whispered Nell.
She gave the youngster the floor and
he jumped to his feet in triumph, yell
ing:
"In come a rat!"
That was too much for Neil's com
posure and he gave way to an infec
tious fit of laughter, In which teacher
and scholars joined.
"You had better go now," she said to
the visitor.
"If I'll promise not to come in again,
may I come every afternoon and row
you and Susie home by the river way?"
She consented to this arrangement,
and thenceforth came halcyon days â to
Neil and Susie, at least.
November vanished and so did the
hunters, save Neil, who lingered and,
upon Mrs. Bradley's invitation, took up
his quarters at the farmhouse. He was
very happy except when he remem
bered how paltry his income would ap
pear in comparison wltn Miss Ran
dall's millions. Susie used to watoh
him closely when he was in one of these
reveries, and her warm little heart, en-,
lightened by her affection for Neil, di
vined the cause. She reached a de
cision. Her opportunity came that
evening. She went to the barn to he-Id
the lantern for Neil while he got some
cider.
"I am going to tell you why Cousin
Kathlyn teaches school," she said
bluntly.
"Oh, but you shouldn't, Susie! Didn't
she tell you not to?"
"No; she didn't say not to tell that
especially. Besides, every one knows
but you. You know you wished Uncle
Wellman was poor."
"Yes," he said, his heart beating with
hope.
"He is now. He lost everything he
had in a minute, and he sent Cousin
Kathlyn here to stay while he went
West to make some more money, and
she would teach so to help him."
"Susie, Susie, you are my good an
gel!" he cried in dellight.
The light of love and hope so trans
figured his countenance that Kathlyn
turned pale when she saw him. When
the Bradley family had considerately
gone to bed at an earlier hour than
usual Neil told Kathlyn all that was in
his heart.
"Dear!" he said reproachfully, "why
didn't you tell me of your father's
loss?"
She looked at him mischievously.
"I was afraid you'd think I was im
agining myself 'in clover.' Besides, it
shouldn't be a question of Income â "
"A rat!" he finished, laughing.

the girls a chance.
"It only needs one to set the ex
ample," M/s. Carlton explained to
Cecilia, who admitted that Angela
must be sacrificed in order that her
sisters "get the habit." But to her
brother she wrote: "It is a crime to
abuse friendship."
The proposed visit was now at hand.
"Muriel and I must lay low; the
full strength of our family girlhood is
so overflowing," said Cecilia, fasten
ing a loose-sleeved apron over her
gown. "Now, little Mother General,
you may attend to the dress parade,
while I bring up the rear with the ra
tions."
After Mrs. Carlton and Angela had
departed Cecilia descended to the
kitchen. She selected her pans, and
washed the currants, sliced the citron
ready for chopping and sifted the
flour, a mischievous rhyme tripping
over her tongue.
"Will you walk into my parlor? said
the spider to the fly â "
The door gong rang sharply. Ce
cilia dusted her hand free from the
flour, aiM went through the dining
room and the long hail to the door.
There she encountered an athletic
young man, bearing a cress-suit case,
with an air of having arrived at his
destination.
"Mrs. Carlton at home?" he in
quired.
"No. If you are a book agent, let
me tell you books are not our crying
need just at present." -.nd the dimple
laughed In Cecilia's cheek.
"I'm not a necessity, and to such a
household certainly no luxury, yet I
am expected. Sounds like a riddle,
doesn't It? Carlton telegraphed me
that he could not get here until to
morrow, but that I was expected."
"We understood you were coming
together, but you are none the less
welcome," she added graciously.
"But youâ" Cecilia suddenly real
ized her apron and the flour and her
mother's horror of the situation. "Oh,
I am baking cake â Iâ l am the girl,
you knowâ" She drew herself up, but
the dimple effaced the dignity, and
there waa an odd twitching about the
young fellow's mouth.
'"I am awfully glad. I thought you
had been branded twice, one mark over
the other, and the dispute arose over
this. Duke, the victim of the shooting,
had borne a bad reputation, and the
village street was usually more or less
uneasy .during his infrequent visits.
He had killed his man, and had been
known to boast of it several times in
Flynn's saloon. After this last quarrel
he had sworn to shoot Copperthwait on
sight. The quarrel had occurred in the
morning. 'That afternoon Copperthwait
had just left the Eagle Hotel, to mount
his mustang tied to the hitching post
in front, when Duke happened to turn
the corner.
"Here comes Duke!" a bystander ex
claimed. Copperthwait started and
caught sight of his adversary. Duke
stopped short and put his hand Hehlnd
him, and Copperthwait, quick as a
flash, fired once and put a bullet be
tween Duke's eyes. He had offered no
resistance to arrest, and now was in
the rough little jail near by while the
twelve good men and true deliberated
in tha- hot back room under the tin
roof of the courthouse.
"I guess my hands are a little too
soft to play," said the Judge good-na
turedly, feeling a qualm as to the ap
propriateness of his joining actively in
the sport; "but I'll be umpire If you
want me."
The two teams were quickly formed,
the "Comanches" against the 'Sioux."
The Sioux won the toss and-, took the
field, and the Comanches were struck
out In one, two, three order. When the
sides changed, Hardy, the prosecuting
attorney, took the box and Blake, the
Junior counsel for the defense, caught
him. After much urging the Judge had
consented to preside over first base,
since Mr. Hackett had positively re
fused to play, and had been made um
pire by general acclaim. As soon as
his Honor found himself coatless and
on the field he threw himself into the
battle with the greatest enthusiasm.
There was many an evidence of "soft
ness" in the condition of the players,
and a noticeable tendency to let swift
balls go by rather than grapple them
with fingers unused to the hard Im
pact. Wild throws to bases were not
infrequent, and in consequence there
was much base stealing and hilarious
sarcasm from the players on both
teams. The official relations of these
men were, for the time, lost sight of;
they were merely healthy, enthusiastic
Americans, feeling the joy of tingling
blood In their veins, the zest of friend
ly competition and of physical exer
cise.
At the beginning of the fourth and
concluding inning the Deputy Sheriff
had come up with the prisoner, who
was not. handcuffed, and they became
interested spectators. Copperthwait's
nerve had been superb throughout the
trial, and he seemed to take an intense
interest in the game.
Just after play had commenced
Hardy knocked a hot grounder to
"short." who fielded the ball swiftly
to first base. The baseman caught it,
putting Hardy out, and then quietly
remarked:
"That settles me. Look at this
thumb!"
"See, here, old man." Hardy panted,
examining it, "it's broken."
"Well, never mind; let somebody
take my place.- Here, some one- â you.
Mulligan. Come and take the base.
I'm out of it."
"Guess not," said Mulligan, the
deputy; "I ain't played ball sinee â "
"Go on with the game!" cried a
dozen others excitedly. "Some one,
any one take the base."
"Here. Coppeithwalt, play first base;
we've only got to hold 'em down this
inning, and we'll beat 'em easy.
There's one out already."
Ethel Barrington
might be one of the daughters, andâ â 
I'm only the valetâ"
"Gracious â "
"So you see we can be friends after
all. May I watch the cake operation?"
Cecilia sanctioned doubtfully. "You
may sit in the dining-room â if you in
sist."
"I doâ"
Cecilia, after providing him with a
paper, disappeared through the swing
ing door into the kitchen. He sat alone
for a few minutes, then gently swung
the door open. "It's quite ch'lly in
here," he explained. Cecilia was beat
ing eggs, the sunlight tipped her hair
with gold. He sank into a chair,
watching her.
"Come, now, you know the saying
about 'idle hands.' You had better
put me to work!" he insisted. She
laughed, but entrusted him with the
chopping-biuvl, and he went to work
spasmodically upon the citron, Cecilia
havfng first tied an apron about his
waist.
"You make an ideal chef,'' she in
formed him. "if you only had a cap."
"I wouldn't want to hare your curls. "
His tone was aggrieved.
"When may we expect your mas
ter?" â¢
"My master? Ohâ oh. yesâ Ashton.
He'll be along about supper time, I
judge."
"Tell me about him and why does
he have a valet; It's rather silly for a
student."
"Not at all," he assured her airily.
"It's very usefulâ sometimes!"
â¢I've heard he is handsome, rich and
a great catch! "
The valet was manifestly embar
rassed for his master. 'You shouldn't
believe all you hear. Now, I under
stand that Laurence â oh, yes, I call
him so just to myselfâ has sisters?"
"Heaps. Five, and â one more," ac
knowledged Cecilia, as she commenced
mixing the cake.
"What is 'one more' like?" he asked
with interest.
"The youngest, and the worst, ' she
confessed, splashing the eggs reck
lessly. The valet retreated to a safe
distance.
"It looks an awful mess. Is that the
way they make wedding cake?"
"Wedding cake! " What has that to
do with the subject?"
Nothingâ it just came into my
head "
"Then put it oat. Poor men cannot
afford extravagance and wedding cake
is a never ending expense. Mr. Ash
ton should hear you."
"I am following his example. I
know he is going to make desperate
love to one of the daughters."
Copperthwait looked uncertainly at
the deputy, then the Judge, and
quickly pulled oft his coat and stepped
to the base. His face showed clearly
the prison pallor, and this warm, sun
light and fresh air seemed wonderfully
sweet to his spirit. Taken suddenly
away from the active, vigorous life of
the ranch, for seven months confined
in a dreary prison, the world had
seemed, gradually to recede from hia
life. This sudden contrast of greeu.
open field, ringing with the hearty
voices of his fellow man, and the
vision of the free, limitless prairie on
all sides was a tragic one to the man.
He glanced at the players about him,
pausing in the game and thinking only
of it.
"Go ahead," he said quietly; "I'll
play."
The Comanches failed to make a
run during the rest of the inning, and
when the Sioux came in they made
two runs almost at once, tying the
score, amid great enthusiasm.
As Copperthwait came to the bat
it was evident that the psychological
moment of the sport had arrivel.
' Everything had been completely for

Copperthwait reached third amid much

team mates; "get home and you'll win
the game! Steady, now! Look out.

"Now, Hardy." pleaded the Judge,
"for heaven's sake, play ball! Don't
let him make this run:"
"Steady, Hardy." said the catcher;
"watch my signs."
The janitor had crept up close to first
base.
"Say, Judge." he whispered to his
Honor, who was now dancing like an
Indian and watching every move of thÂ«
pitcher and Copperthwait with devour
ing anxietyâ "say. Judge, the Jury has

"Oh, to h with the Jury!" snapped

"Safe!" yelled the umpire, and pan

"I guess safe's the word, all right,"
muttered the janitor to the deputy,
who had instantly started for the pris
oner. "I had a wink from the foreman

He threw himself back again in his

having '"sent more men to hâ l than
any gambler in the West."
"Yu luck ain't wid yu this date and

ejaculated Biggs with an assurance
that offset his opponents confidence
to noticeable effect. "It's square this

The straw of circumstance that
brought the sturdy ranger to the
"limit," as he termed the West, ar.-l
dropped him into this corner, 'l can
not recall, but certain I am of this:
that few men ever braved the hard
ships and privations and still looked
upon the world with the noble spirit
that distinguished his traits of char
acter above the greater majority. The
cow-puncher regalia belied the man.
M Tided at the elbow and knees by a

shod with a pair of boots that had
long outserviced the cost, there
beamed from the inner man that inex
pressible something that partook of
the spirit of the Maker in whose like
ness man was wrought. Exceptional
in his judgment, he based his associa
tions and dealings with men accord
ingly, and completely trusted his Judg
ment, having once formed It.
In the strength of his own convic
tions, butteressed by fortitude of char
acter, he never failed to win friends
in whatever circle, of fortune or tan
gent of adversity fate had marked his
path.
His true insight showed him into
the state of affairs of the purse-proud
and braggart - gambler, whose extra
ordinary luck had become a by-word
in the camp and who ruled the fate
of every man in Hitluck who had tried
his luck with him at" the gambling

he was battling against a stronger
luck-power, and experienced his first
timidity at this contest, for decided

f'-ar, as calm promised, deposited the
order before them.
"I'll go you!" said Biggs, takinsr up
the glass before him and he drank the
contents; and, "one with me!' sounded
with feeling of goodwill. His discrimi
nation again was not amiss; but he
drained the last drop of the second.
Then taking up the yellow pile he dis
tributed it in his pockets and old ban
dana and left in time to thwart a well
planned game of "consequences." ~
Up to date there were no banks in
the community; and the question of
depositing the winnings was upper
most in his mind. "Ted," the faithful
quadruped and companion of five years,
was made treasurer of the wherewith
of his luxurious feast, which his mas
ter had deposited in installments,
beneath his fodder. The following: day
found Parks, a boarder, in the barred
quarters; booked for. assault, with "his
best friend." as he termed his Colts.
"Law won't make him the better for
it." thought Big: â¢-. "and the least I can
do for him is to put up out of his
losings. â¢
"Yu aint the stuff for a bird cage.
Parka! Take this and pay me, with
the legal, when yu can," said Bises.
with an expression of confidence and
good will that drew the responsive note
from the better nature of the prisoner.
"Biggs." interceded Parks. "I'm known
as the all-round bad man: but. if.
there's any good in me, here's my
hand!' â¢ ~7 Â»
Inborn in the American heart is the
spirit of civic pride, and whatever as
pciatio-ns may effect, and though evil
may have permeated and predominated
in individualistic faults, there shows
the unit of a high public spirit. The
town was in its Infancy and there were
in demand men of the right caliber.
"Whether the dignity of the new out
fit suggested (for I had no credentials),
is Btill'a problem," said Biggs, uncon
scious of the fact that other men were
students of character, and the worth
of such a "man as Biggs, in yiew <-f
generating a clean municipal govern
ment, was invaluable to the common
interest. No better supporter than
Parks materialized.
"It's a cinch that he's the square
man," was the ready and invariable
reply from Parks, and "I'm a-goln' to
vote for him."
The decisive day brought Biggs out
a winner by a big majority, and in the
run of congratulations came, with the
unmistakable expression of joy, the re
sp<-< ting conviction of Parks: "I knew
it when I furst looked into your face,
and we've got the 'square' man! Hit
luck will be a 'model' yet! "
"A man's a beast when he will stand
force, but it takes a man to run
course," was the philosophy of the new
'Judge."
Mealtimes rolled around in the order
of things in the camp and found
"Judge Biggs" a first-class, regular
boarder at the modest and cleanly res
taurant, kept by a hard-working, frail,
little widow as the only means of sup
port for her young brood.
The pleasant demeanor of the sturdy
"Judge" was ever welcomed and greet
ed with the sweet sad smile and courte
ous attentions, for she considered it an
honor to number so prominent a per
sonage among her patrons.
George and May attached themselves
adhesively to the generous lover of
children, who-, as regular as the hours
came, awaited his coming with purest
affections. Confidences were ex
changed in the course of acquaintance
ship, which, grew into a friendship,
and, having become interested. Biggs
learned from many sources the sad
story.
James Wilson and family, lured by

Like most mining camps, municipal
discipline was not bred with it? birth
and the social influence preyed vulturc
lik(.> upon the unwary.
Wilson had been a victim of the once
notorious Parks, which misfortune de
prived the seemingly happiest and pros
perous family of their claim and homo.
In the face of adversity and the hu
miliation under the ban of a stricken
(M-nscience. Wilson became a hopeless
invalid and ended his luckless life in a
well-planned 'accidental" suicide. Pub
lic records told their part and held out
a hope for the charitably inclined in
quirer.
It chanced, in the narrow confines of
the town, that two future bosom
friends met in the persons of "Judge
Biggs" and the reformed Parks.
"On yu way to dinner, I suppose!"
interpreted the latter.
"Just it, won't yu join me?" welcom
ing him with the firm grasp.
"It wud be a pleasure, but I have
just finished. Where do you eat?"
Parks inquired.
"At the Wilson restaurant." was the
commendatory reply. A death-like
pallor now spread over the face of the
man. once moved Into sensibility by
nothing so trifling as humanity and
whose only ambition had been a "high
hand" at the expense of any sacrifice
but his own greedy gain. '"Judge," he
confessed, a fullness almost rendering
the words inaudible, "I feel myself a
debtor to that little woman and I'm
aimin* to make it good." Quick to the
point the noble soul offered: "If there's
anything I can do toward that result,
let me know, won't you. Parks?"
"I want to talk it over with you and
perhaps I can effect it sooner," followed
with an anxious impulse.
"Come to my office, then, at your
early convenience!"
The interests of the poor woman
were planned as with one mind. Biggs,
with a prophetic conception, knew what
the result would be, and with more
knowledge of the rrfatter than Parks
surmised, was a good general for the
next move.
The patter of little feet, hastening to
mtet "Judge Bids," the tiny out
stretched hands waving the fond wel
come, lips eager to share the envied
kiss, and the gurgling laughter of
happy childhood evinced that he had
won the hearts of the children at least.
In the proceedings of the meeting at
the office Parks made a clean breast
of the incidents relative to the game
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
that cost, at length, Wilson's life, and,
pertaining to possession of the claim
and the personal interests of Mrs. Wil
son, interjected: "What I want to con
fer with yu about, is this: The prop
erty with an incumbrance of three
thousand dollars would not be a whole
some gift to the lady. Will it be worth
the mortgage to you? It will, I hope,
pay 'with the legal' my debt to you.
I don't know how big a mortgage yu
already hold on the little widow, judg
in' from the way that new home is get
tin' on." Judge Biggs heartily inter
rupted: "You've got your suspicions,
DORCAS
LAWRENCE
eh? Well, a home is what every man
wants, married or single."
"It will be a darn happy thought to
me. Judge, if you and that little woman
hitch traces."
"Do yu think there's a chance for
me?"
"As sure as my vote is 'Square
Biggs' as long as he runs for office!"
aasuringly responded Parks.
"If I were as sure of her as I am of
the babies, I'd summon more courage,
but there's better lookin' got eyes for
the mother; and I'm 'fraid of a trump.
There's one sure guess, it will be on
hearts when she does come in."
The fact Is, there was a "special em
bassy" to the Wilson home every even
ing, and, as often, one might have In
ferred from the preparations of pre
cision, that a wedding with Bigg 3as
groom was about to take place. Phrases
â were composed and committed, re
hearsed over and over, condensed into a
dozen choicest words and finally deliv
ered in the fearful introductory: "I
have a business matter to present to
you. Mrs. Wilson?" â and interest in the
children, of course, turned the channel
of conversation.
"If I win the little widow, remember,
you must be on hand with swallow
tails. tfÂ»o:" emphasized Biggs. "Here's
that deed. .Judge, â yu know what
I would say â "Square for Parks* this
time." came in word 3 with mingled re
gret and. joy, and they . clasped hands
that welded the band 3 of a brother
hood.
' 'This has come in most opportune to
fulfill my 'business affair' with Mrs.
Wilson." thought he, and brought Biggs
on hand a half-hour too soon for din
ner.
'â¢This is the circular, which you will
please read carefully, at your earliest
convenience. Mrs. "Wilson, in regard to
the .'business matter' dÃref erred to," in
flecting impressively on the last.
"Thank you, I shall do so' with pleas
ure." she said, . receiving the wrapped
deed.'
, The exciting rumors of "rich strikes'*
opened the conversation by Mrs. Wil
son, apparently more socially.
"How would you like to own a
claim?" he inquired. ;
A sadness crept over her countenance
as she reflected. "Though Mr. Wilson
and I built great hopes on the prospects
of our claim,, especially . the east ledge*
âand the trembling voice told mora
than words â "I could not have held it
under the incumbrance after my hus
band's death. It seems impossible for a
woman to manage such affairs alone,
as a man."
"Wudn't you have trusted me for, a
business manager?" inquired Biggs,
with evident feeling of anxious per
suasiveness.
Her confidence-lit eyes looked up. "I
could not have mistrusted your honor
for one moment. Mr. Biggs, and were I
in possession of the property now you
"would be the only person I would trust
â¢with my interests." responded she with
undoubtful sincerity.
, The wan face grew more interesting
to him then the prospects of twenty El
Dorados, and though the eloquence
with which he thought to express his
immediate intentions again failed him.
the unwelcome and untimely intrusion
of another early boarder curtailed the
important proceedings.
Parks, beside himself with joy. hav
ing emulated the example of his best
friend, was waiting when Biggs re
turned from dinner.
"What's the verdict?" hastened thÂ«
former, having discerned his exonera
tion in the happy expression of the. man
approaching the office door.
"Well. pard, there's one thing sure â a
job for both of us. How are you on
mining?" queried Biggs.
"Fair." was the honest reply. "About
the east ledge, what are the pros
pects?"
"I'm not. familiar with that ledge;
but from late assays of other veins it is
rich," Biggs Informed. "You have come
into possession of the adjoining claim
by the will of your late brother. James
Parks?" .
"That's right. Judge: and how about
a company?" prospected Parks, with
the confidence of- meeting with ap
proval.
"What will it take to start the
game? 1 '
"About five thousand," replied
Parks, thoughtfully figuring in round
numbers, "ought to put us about
right."
"It's a go: start her up and name
"luck', the password".!*
"If we tickle the east edg-a, from
what I would guess, we'll find it cross-
Ing the line, and" when the little
widow joins our company, of which
there seems no doubt, we're got a
mortgage on success, eh .' "
"Then I'll have wad enough to get
that swallow tail." Parks prophesied.
The mere suggestion of '.'swallow
tails" started the unmistakable prÂ«p*a
rations: â¢â ! but . Parks patiently waited
and accompanied the "embassy this
greater distance. "Tell me next the
Wilson district went square- Tor
Biggs." were the parting words from"
the , stanch and Inseparable friend.
.No interruptions occurred that
night in ; the "court." for the little'
Wilsons were snug and sound in their
cribs.
"I firmly believe you were instru
mental in effecting this 'deed of gift.*
Mr. Biggs." said Mrs. Wilson, as the
'tears of joy fell upon her pale cheek
and her both hands clasped, with su
preme gratefulness,* the hand of thÂ»
humanitarian. ;
*"I could , not have brought that
p.tout if Mr. Parks had not intended
I*. He has ; proven himself a worthy
man and i 3 a true friend."
"I know he is a man of noblo
traits and I wish to express my grate
fulness to him personally. Is he In
town at present?"
; "He is, Mrs. Wilson," was the clear
rtply.
A profound quiet took po3<uÂ»9slon
of the "court" for a minute suddenly
broken by the abruptness peculiar, in
his nature: "Mrs. Wilson, it is *m
possible for me to keep house alone:
can I persuade you to accept the po
sition? *I. . mean permanently. I
want " "Love!" she assisted with that
sincerity that evinces the > nob'eness
of < thu true woman; â¢ "that you havÂ«Â»
at heart of the whole family, but I
almost feared to hope : for reciproca-.
tton myself:, you seemed to court only
the avtections of the children." '
"You will be
Mrs. Biggs?" ;he
queriedâ a strong
,->ers uasiveness
prompted* by his
anxious tone.
"Yes: and the
proudest and . hap
pie?t woman in the
world to be her!"
was the full [ heart
ed assurance. -
- "Why didn't we,

she found her place

IT was no very unusual thing for
Mr. Lebtrade of {Scotland Yard to
look in upon us of an,evening, and
his visits were welcome to Sherlock
, Holmes, for they enabled him to
k-ep In touch with all that was go-ing
on at the police headquarters. Â» In re
turn for the news which Lestrade
would bring. Holmes was always ready
to listen with attention to the details
of any case upon which the detective
was engaged, and was aoie occasional
ly, without any active interference, to
give some hint or suggestion drawn
from his own vast knowledge and ex
perience.
On this particular evening Lestrade
had cpoken of the weather and the
newspapers. Then he had fallen silent,
puffing thoughtfully at his cigar.
Holmes looked keenly at him.
"Anything remarkable on hand?" he
asked.
"Oh. no. Mr. Holmesâ very
particular."
"Then tell me about- it."
Lestrade laughed.
"Well. Mr. Holmes, there is no use
denying that there is something on my
mind. And yet it is such an absurd
business, that I hesitated to both^**
you about it. On the other hand.yJT
though it is trivial, it is undoub/dly
queer. ar.d I know 'that you ha/*- a
taste for all that is 'out of the common.
But, in my c pinion, it "comes mire* in
Dr Watgbn'a line than ours." 1
"Disease?" said I. 1
"Madness, anyhow. And a Vuter '
madness, too. You wouldn't' kink
â there was any one living at this tVi*
of day who had such a hatred of Nik '
poleon the First that he would break>
any image of him that he could see."
Holmes sank back in his chair.
That's no business of mine," said he.
"Exactly. That's v. hat I said. But
then, wherTlhe man commits burglary
in order to break.images which are- not
his own. that brings it away from the
doctor and on 10 the policeman.''
Holmes sat up again.

"The first case reported was^our
days ago." said he. "It was Jl the ;

"The second case, ho\\*\vi, was more
serious, and also morl singular. it
occurred only last night > ; .
â¢ "In Kenningtc-n Road.land within a

Lower Brixton Road, two miles away.
This Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic
admirer of Napoleon, and his house is
full of books, pictures and relies of the
French Emperor. Some little time ago
he purchased from Morse Hudson two
duplicate plaster casts ofÂ« the famous
head of Napoleon by the French sculp

his â¢hall in the house at Kennington
Road, and the other on the mantelpiece
of the surgery at Lower Brixton. Well.

morning he was astonished to find that

Holmes had : taken several notes dur
ing Mr. f Harding's evidence and r could
see that he was thoroughly satisfied by
the turn which affairs were taking.
He made }no ! remark, however, save
that, unless we hurried, we should be
late for our appointment with Lestrade.
Sure enough, when we reached , Baker
â  street the * detective was already there
.and we found him pacing up and down

Holmes spent the evening in rum
maging amoni? the* flies of the old
daily papers with which one of our
lr.mber-ruums was packed. When at
last he descended it was with triumph
in his eyes, but he said nothing to
either of us as to the result of his re
searches. For my own part I had fol
lowed step by step the methods by
which he had traced the various wind
ings of this complex case, and though
I could not yet perceive the goal which
we would reach I understood clearly
that Holmes expected this grotesque
criminal to make an attempt upon the
two remaining busts, one of which. I
remembered, was at Chiswick- No
doubt the object of our journey was
to catch him in the very act. and I
could not but admire the cunning with
wjuch my friend had inserted a wrong
clew in the evening paper so as to rive
the fellow ihe idea that he oould con
tinue his scheme with impunity. I was
not surprised when Holmes suggested
that I should take my revolver with
me. He had himself pietjed up the
toaded hunting-crop, which Was his fa
vorite weapon.
A four-wheeler was at the door at
II and in it we drove to a spot at the
other side Â»A Hammersmith bridge.
Here the cabman was directed to wait.
A short walk brought us to a secluded
road fringed with pleasant houses, each
standing in it 3 own grounds. In the
light of a street* lamp we read "La
burnum Villa" upon the gatepost of
one of them. The occupants had evi
dently retired to rest, for all was dark
save for a fanlight over the hall door.
which shed a single blurred circle on
to the garden path. The wooden fence
which separated the grounds from the
road threw a dense black shadow upon
the inner side, and here it was that we
crouched. *
"I fear that you'll have a long wait."
Holmes whispered. "We may think our
stars that it is not raining. I don't
think we can even venture to smoke
to- pass the time. However. It's a 2 to
1 chance that we .get something to pay
us for our trouble."
It proved, however, that our vigil
was not t<> be so long as Holmes had
led us to fear, and it ended In a very
sudden and singular fashion. In an
instant, without the least sound to
warn us Â«^f his coming, the garden gate
swung open and a lithe, dark figure as
swift and active as an ape rushed up
the garden path. We saw it whisk
past the light thrown from over the
door and disappear against the black
shadow at the house- There was a
long pause, during which we held our
breath and then a very gentle creak
ing sound came to*our ears. The win
dow was being opened. The noise
ceased, and again there was a long
silence. The fellow was making his
way into the house. We saw the sud
den flash of a dark lantern inside the
room. What he sought was evidently
not there, for again we saw the flash
through another blind and then*
through^ another.
"Let us get to the open window.
We will nab him aa he climbs out."
Leatrade whispered.
But before we could move the man
had emerged again. As he came out
into the glimmering patch of light we
saw that he carried something white
under his arm. He looked stealthily
all round him. The silence of the de
serted street reassured him. Turning;
his back upon us he laid down his
burden and the nÂ«xt instant there was
the sound of a sharp tap, followed by
a clatter and rattle. The man wÂ«fa so
Indent upon what he was doing that
he never heard our steps as we stole
across* the grass plot. With the bound
of a tiger Holmes was on his back, and
an instant later Lestrade and I had
him by either wrist and the handcuffs
had been fastened. As we turned him
over I saw a hideous, sallow face with
writhing, furious features, glaring up
at us. and I knew that it was indeedthe man of the" photograph whom we
had secured. :
But it was not our prisoner to whom
Holmes was giving his attention,
fcquatted on the doorstep he was en
gaged in most carefully examining that ,
which the man had brought from the
house. It was a bust of Napoleon, like '
the one which we had seen that morn
ing, and it had been broken into sim
ilar fragments. Carefully Holmes held
each separate shard to the light, but
in no way did it differ from any other
shatters piece of plaster. He had
t u c ?, f ? pl^ ted his examination when
the hall lights flew up, the door opened
and the owner of the house, a Jovial,
rotund figure in shirt and trousers", pre
sented himself. .
"Josiah Brown, I suppose?" said
iitrtmes.
i J 6 ?; sir; and you no doubt are Sher
lock Holmes? I had the note which
TÂ° U ,f ent by the express messenger, and
I dii exactly what you told me. We
locked every door on the inside and
awaited developments. Well, I'm very
glad to see that you have got the ras
cal. 1 hope, gentlemen, that "you will
come in and have some refreshment."
However, Lestrade was anxious to
get his man into safe quarters, so with
in a few minutes our cab had been
summoned and we were all four upon
our way to London. Xot a word would
our captive say. but he glared at us
from thÂ« shadow of his matted hair,
and once, when my hand seemed with
in his reach he snapped at it like a
hungry wolf. We stayed long enough
at the police station to learn that a
search of his clothing revealed nothing
save a few shillings and a long sheath
knife, the handle of which bare copious
traces of recent blood.
"That's all right." said Lestrade, as
â¢we parted. "Hill knows all these gen
try and he will give a name to him.
You'll find that my theory of the Mafia
â will work out all right- But I'm sure
1 am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr.
Holmes, for the- workmsjilike way in
vhich you laid hands upon him. I
don't quite understand it all yet."
"I fear it is rather too late an hour

a reckless, ribald utterance like one
thickened with liquor. It conveyed an
invitation to everybody within hearing
to share its owner's punch. Laughter
followed, and from outside a flutter of
withdrawing skirts and a masculine
exclamation of affront.
With a puzzled wonder the man In
the arbor listened, while the voice
â within lifted in an uncertain song:
Fare thee well', and if forever.
Still forever fare thee well;
Even though unforgiving, never
'Galnrt thee ehaJl my heart rebel.
"Shameless brute:" came from the
porch. "I wouldn't have believed if."
Smothering a fierce ejaculation, Gor
don strode to the window and gazed
into the room. The singer broke off
â¢with a laugh:
"That's the song I always wacDle,
gentlemen, when I'm in my cups. I
wrote it to my â when I was a
Bond-street lounger, a London cicibeo
and fan-carrier to a woman."
The man who stared across the sill
with a painful fascination was witness
ing a glaring, vulgar travesty of him
self. Not the George Gordon he was,
or, indeed, had ever been, but the
George Gordon the world believed him;
the abandoned profligate of wassail ana
blackguardism, whom tourists boasted
of having seen, and of whom the elev
enth commandment had been promul
gated for all British womankindâ not to
read his books. And this counterpart
was being played by a - man whose
Moorish, theatric face he knewâ a man
he had flung from his path at Geneva,
when he stood with Jane Clermont by
the margin of the lake on the night he
and be had fled together. A man who
hated him! Â£'-- .'â '
The clever effrontery of the deception
showed how deep was that hatred. Gor
don understood now how Tita had
heard of his presence at the osteria be
fore he had entered it. The farceur in-
Fide did not know the ' man he imper
sonated was in Ravenna to-night. This,
then, was the only caravansary âat
which the burlesque, had . been played,
2Cor were these tourists smirking in the
tap-room, or listening open-mouthed
outside to. the clumsy farrago, the only
ones to return to England with clack
ing tongues. This was how the London
papers had bristled with garbled inven
tions! This scene was only a step In a
consistent plan to blacken his name
anew throughout the highways of con
tinental travel! 1 v
- A guttural whisper escaped his lips.
It would be another bar between him
and possession of Allegra. And Te
resa? If these post-house tales reached
her ears! A crimson mist grew before
his eyes. BHHR V
A more reckless and profane empha
sis had come now to the carouser.with
Â»â¢â  He had risen and approached the
pouh window, simulating as he walked
an . awkward * limp.
"I was very much surprised at your
letter, for I could not imagine how >cv
knew that I owned such a thing."
"Of course, you must have beon sur
prised, but the explanation is very
simple. Mr. Harding of Har-ilns Broth
ers said that they had sold you Their
last copy and he gave me your ad
dress."
"Oh. that was It, was it? Did he tell
you what I paid for it?"
"No, he did not."
"Well, I aih an honest man, thov^h
not a very rich one. I oniy gave 15
shillings for the bust, and I thins you
ought to know that before I take Â£10
from you."
"I am sure the scruple does you
honor, Mr. Sandeford. But I have
named that price, so I intend to stick
to it."
"Take a greeting to England, you
globe-trotters! Greeting from Venice,
the sea-Sodom, to London! Hell is not
paved with its good intentions. Slabs
of lava, with its parsons' damned souls
for cement, make a better causeway
for Satan's corso!"
Again he turned to his fellows In
the taproom: "When I shuffle ; off
it will be like the rascals to dump
me into Westminster Abbey. If they
do, I'll save them the trouble of the
epitaph. I've written It myself: , .
George Gordon lies here, peer of Nottingham

one.

"Westminster Abbey! " said a man's
bass in disgust. ' * "\
Gordon's left hand reached and
grasped the sill. His face was con
vulsed. His : right hand went to his
breast pocket. \ '
At that instant, from behind him, a
touch fell on his arm and stayed it. "A
â¢letter, Excellence." "
He turned with a long, shuddering
breath, and took what â¢ Tlta handed
him. . â â -â  --â¢-: . *:-. : â  ; â¢ - .:..
"I understand, Tita," .he answered,
with an effort. The other nodded and
disappeared. .
For a moment Gordon stood motion
less. Then he passed from the : arbor,
through the -hedges, to the spot whither
the gondolier ; had â  led him two hours
before. He sat down on the turf, and
buried , his : face in : his 'hands. . t -v~ '
He had scarcely known what shape
less, lurid thing had leaped up in his
soul as he gazed through the window,
but the touch on : . his arm- had told
him. For the moment the pressure had
seemed Teresa's hand, as he had felt it
en the path at ! San Lazarro, when the
same red mist had swum before his
eyes. Then It had roused a swift sense
of shame;, now the memory did * more.
The man yonder he had injured. There
had been a deed of shame and dastard
cowardice years before in Greeceâ yet
what had he to do with the boy's 1 act?
By what right had -he, that night in
Geneva, Judged the other's motive , to
ward v Jane Clermont? ;' Had his own
been bo pure a one then? > Because of a
fancied wrong, Trevanion had * dogged
him to Switzerland., Because of a real
one he dogged him now. .
â¢ After a time Gordon ; raised his : head
and stared out into the moonlight. "It
is : past," he said aloud and with com
posure. "It shall never tempt me again!
What comes |to Ime thus I myself have
beckoned. ";- I will not ' try to avert 'â  it ' by

He rose â  slowly - and ' walked back ' to
ward the osteria. : A groom ; was wash
ing â¢ out â¢ the 1 empty diligence. ;He ; sent
him for his ; horse, and in â  a ; few ' mo -

streets f of Ravenna.
A new, nascent tenderness was In
"Well, it Is very handsome of you,
Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust up
with me, as you asked me to do. Here
it is!" He ppened his bag, and at last
we saw placed upon our table a com
plete specimen of that bust which we
had already seen more than once fh
fragments.
Holmes took a paper from his pocket
and laid a Â£10 note upon the table.
"You will kindly sign that paper,
Mr. Sandeford, in the presence of
these witnesses. It is simply to- say
that you transfer every possible right
that you ever had in the bust to me.
I am a methodical man, you see, and
you never know what turn events
might take afterward. Thank you,
Mr. Sandeford; here is your money,
and I wish you a very good evening."
When our 'visitor had disappeared,
him. He was riding from her, the one
woman he loved â to see her when and
where? Should he ever see her again?
She might have hope of relief in the
letter he carried, but who could tell
if it would succeed? And in the mean
time she was alone, as she had been
alone before.
He rode on, his chin sunk on his
breast, scarcely observing a coach of
si*' white horses that passed him,
driven in the opposite direction.
CHAPTER XXXVII.
Trevanion Finds an Ally.
Trevanion, the drunkenness slipped
from his face and the^irksome limp
discarded, came from the osteria door.
His audience dwindled, he was minded
for fresh air and a stroll. Behind the
red glow of his cigar his dark face
wore a smile.
Just at the fringe of the foliage two
stolid figures in servants' livery
stepped before him. Startled, he drew
back. Two others stood behind him.
He looked from side to side, pale with
sudden anticipation, his lips drawn
back like a lynx at bay. He was
weaponless. .
A fifth figure Joined the circle that
hemmed himâ Paolo, suave, smiling,
Corsican.
"Magnificence ." he said in respect
ful Italian, "I bear the salutations of
a gentleman of Ravenna, who begs
your presence at his house to-night."
Without waiting answer, he called
softly, and a coach with six white
horses drew slowly from the shadow.
For an instant Trevanion smiled in
grim humor, half deceived. A simul
taneous movement of the four in
livery, however, recalled his dvstrust.
"Are these his bravos?" he inquired
in surly defiance.
"His servants, Magnificence!"
"Carry my excuses then â and bid
him mend the manner of his invita
tions."
â¢'I should regret to have to convey
such a message from the milord."
Paolo opened the coach door as he
spoke. The inference was obvious.
Trevanion glanced swiftly over his
shoulder toward the still hostelry. His
first sound of alarm might easily be
throttled. At any rate, he reflected,
these were not the middle ages. To
the owner of this equipage he was an
English lord, and lords were not kid
naped and stilettoed, even in Italy.
Some wealthy Ravennese, perhaps, not
openly to flout public disapproval,
chose thus to gratify his curiosity. An
ticipating refusal, he had taken this
method of urbane constraint. Well,
perforce, he would see the adventure
through! He shrugged his shoulders
and entered the coach.
Paolo seated himself and the Ijorses
started at a swinging trot. Through
the windows Trevanion could discern
the forms of the men servants running
alongside. He sat silent, his compan
ion vouchsafing no remark till the
carriage stopped and they alighted at
the open portal of a massive structure
fronting the paved street. It was Casa
Guiccioli.
The C^rslcan led the way In and the
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY. CALL
Sherlock Hc-lmes' movements were ouch
as to rivet our attention. He began
by taking a clean white cloth from a
drawer and laying it over the table.
Then he placed his newly acquired
bust in the center of the cloth. Final
ly he picked up his hunting crop and
struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the
top of the head. The figure broke into
fragments and Holmes bent eagerly
over the shattered remains. Next in
stant, with a loud shout of triumph he
held up one splinter, in which a round,
dark object was fixed like a plum in a
pudding.
"Gentlemen," he cried, "let me intro
duce you to the famous black pearl of
the Borgias."
Lestrade and I sat silent for a mo
ment and thoji, with a spontaneous
impulse, we both broke out clapping,
servants disappeared. With a word
Paolo also vanished and the man bo
strangely introduced gazed about him.
The hall was walled with an arras
tapestry of faded antique richness,
hung with uncouth weapons. Opposite
ascended a broad, dimly lighted stair
way holding niches of tarnished armor.
Wealth with penuriousness showed
everywhere. Could this whimsical
duress be the audacity of some self
willed dama, weary of her cavajiere
servente and scheming thus to gain a
romantic tete-a-tete with the famed
and defamed personage he had cari
catured that day? Trevanion stole soft
ly to the arras, wrenched a Malay kriss
from a clump of arms and slipped it
under his coat.
A moment later his guide reappeared.
Up the stair, along a tiled and gilded
hall, he followed him to a wide stanza.
A door led from this, at which Paolo
knocked.
As it opened the compelled %vest
caught a glimpse of the interior, set
with mirrors and carved furniture,
paneled and ornate with the delicate
traceries of brush and chisel. In the
room stood two figures â a man bent
from age, his face blazing with the
watchfires of an unbalanced purpose,
and a woman, young, lovely, dis
traught. She wore a dressing gown,
and her gold hair fell uncaught about
her shoulders, as though she had been
summoned in haste to a painful au
dience. Her eyes, on the man, were
fixed in an expression of fearful won
der. One hand was pressed hard against
her heart. Trevanion had never seen
either before; what did they want with
him?
"Your guest," announced Paolo on
the threshold.
"What do you mean to do?" cried the
girl in frantic fear. "He is a noble of
England! You dare not harm him!"
"I am a noble of Romagna!" grated
the old man.
It was the real George Gordon they
expectedâ not he! Trevanion was smil
ing as Pat>lo spoke to him. With a
hand on the blade he concealed he
strode forward past him into the room.
"Your servant, signore," said he, as
the door closed behind him.
There was a Becond of silence, broken
by a snarl from the old Count and a
cry from Teresaâ a sob of relief. She
leaned against the wall, in the reaction
suddenly faint. Her husband's sum
mons had filled her with apprehension
âfor she recalled the sound in the
shrubberyâ and his announcement, full
of menace to Gordon, had shaken her
mettle of resistance. She remembered
an old story of a hired assassin whis
pered of him when she was a child. At
the insane triumph and excitement in
his manner she had been convinced and
frightened. Terror had seized her anew
âthe shivering terror of him feat had
come to her on the monastery path and
that her after-resentment had allayed.
Now. however., her fear calmed, in
dignation at what' she deemed a ruse
to compel an admission of concern that
had but added to her husband's fury,
sent the blood back to her cheeks. All
the repressed feeling that his cumula
as at the well-wrought crisis of a play.
A flush of color sprang to Holmes'
pale cheeks and he bowed to us like
the master dramatist who receives the
homage of his audience. It was at
such moments that for an instant he
ceased to be a reasoning machine and
betrayed his human love for admira
tion and applause. The same singu
larly proud and reserved nature which
turned away with disdain from popu
lar notoriety was capable of being
moved to its depths by spontaneous
wonder and praise from a friend.
"Yes, gentlemen," said he, "it is the
most famous pearl now existing in the
world, and it has been my good for
tune, by a connected chain of induc
tive reasoning, to trace it from the
Prince of Colonna's bedroom at the
Dacre Hotel, where it was lost, to the
tive humiliations had aroused burst
their bonds. She turned on him with
quivering speech:
'â Evviva, signore!" she said bitterly.
"Are you not proud to have frightened
a woman by this valorous trick? Have
you other comedies to garnish the
evening? Non iraportaâ l leave them
for your guest."
Trevanion's face wore a smile of rel-"
ish as she swept from the room. He
was certain now of two things. The
old man hated George Gordon; the girl
âwas she daughter or wife? â did not.
Had he unwittingly stumbled upon a
chapter in the life of the man he
trailed which he had not known? He
seated himself with coolness, his in
herent dare-deviltry flaunting to the
surface*.
Through the Inflamed brain of the
master of the casa, as he stared at
him with his hawk eyes, were crowd
ing suspicions. Paolo's description had
made him certain of the identity of
the man in the -garden. But his com
mand to his secretary had named only
the milord at the osteria. That the
two were one and the same Paolo could
not have known â otherwise he would
not have brought another. But how
had he been deceived? How, unless
the man before him was a confeder
ate â had played the other's part at the
inn? It was a decoy, so the lover of
his wife, with less . isk in the amour,
might laugh in his sleeve at him, the
hoodwinked husband, the richest noble
in Romagna! His lean fingers twitched.
"May I ask," he queried, wetting his
lips, "what the real milord â who is also
in town to-dayâ pays you for filling his
place to-night?" .
Possessed as he was, his host could
not mistake the other's unaffected sur
prise. Before the start he gave, sus
picion of collusion shredded thin.
"He is in Venice," said Trevanion.
"He came to Ravenna this after
noon."
His enemy there? Trevanion re
membered the laugh of the woman in
the wagonette. Jane Clermont had
mocked him! She lied! She had come
there to meet Gordon. Vicious passion
gathered on his brow, signs readily
translatable, that glozed the old man's
anger with dawning calculation.
â¢You have acted another's role to
night," Count Guiccioll said, leaning
across the table, "and done it well, I
judge, for my secretary is no fool. I
confess to a curiosity to know why you
chose to appear as the milord for whom
I waited."
Trevanion's malevolence leaped In his
answer: "Because I hate him! And
hate him more than you! In Italy I
can add to the reputation he owns al
ready in England! I want his name to
blacken and blister wherever it is spok
en! That's why!"
The Count made an exclamation, as
through his fevered blood the idea of
the truth raced swiftly. The town
loungers had gaped at the osteria to
sec the carousal of the milordâ so
Paolo had said. Why, it was as good
as a play! He smiledâ and thought
further: â¢
The Englishman had been in Ra
interior of this, the last of the a
bu3ts of Napoleon which were manu
factured by Gelder & Co. of Stepne
You will remember, Lestrade, the sen
sation caused by the disappearance
this valuable jewel and the vain c
forts of the London police to recov
It. I was myself consulted upon th
case, but I was unable to throw an
light upon it. Suspicion fell upon th
maid of the Princess, who was a
Italian, and it was proved that sh
had a brother in London, but we
failed to trace any connection between
them. The maid's name was Lucretia
Venucci, and there is no doubt in my
mind that this Pietro who was mur
dered two nights ago was the brother.
I have been lc-oking up the dates in the
old tiles of the paper and I find that
venna and had eluded his grasp. Here
before him was youth, clever and un
scrupulous; if less cunning, yet bolder
â a hatred antedating his own â a ready
tool. Who could tell to what use such
an ally might be put? The suggestion
fascinated him. He laughed a splin
tered treble as he rang the bell sharply
for his secretary.
"A bottle of Amontillado'!" he com
manded. "My good Paolo, we drink
a health to the guest of the casa."
As the secretary disappeared Tre
vanion drew the kriss from beneath
his coat and handed it to its owner.
"A pretty trifle." he said coolly; "I
took the liberty of admiring it as I
waited. I quite forgot to replace it."
"My dear friend!" protested the
Count, pushing it back across the
table, "I rejoice that you should fancy
one of my poor possessions: I pray
you accept it. Who knows? You may
one day find a use for the plaything!"
They sat late over the wine. They
were still conversing when a win
dow in the casa overlooking the
garden opened and Teresa's face
looked out. Her straining â¢emo%ons
had left her trembling. Who was
the swarthy, fierce-eyed man? At the
first sight of him she had felt an in
stinctive recoil.
But her puzzle fell away as she
gazed out into the soft night with its
peace and somnolent intense. From,
the garden below, where she and Gor
don had sat, came the beat of a night
bird bending the poppies. Overhead
tiny pale clouds drifted like cherry
blossoms in the breeze. Far off the
moon dropped closer to the velvet
clasp of the legend-haunted hills. To
night, foreboding seemed treason while
her heart held that one meeting, as
the sky the stars, inalienable, eternal.
Gordon was safe, on hi 3 way to Venice,
and with him was her letter â on
which hung her hope for a papal sepa
ration â all that was possible under the
seneschalship of Rome.
At length she closed the shutter,
knelt at the ivory crucifix that hung
in a corner of the raftered chamber,
and crept into bed.
She fell asleep with a curl â the one
he had kissed â drawn across her lips.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
The Heart of a Woman.
From the coming of Gordon on that
unforgottable night to the garden,
Teresa's pulse began to beat more
tumultuously. To offset the humilia
tion of her daily life indoors and the
tireless surveillance in the person of
Paolo of well-nigh her every excur
sion, she had the buoyant memory of
that hour and the promise of her ap
peal to the Church's favor. The three
essentials of woman's existence â love,
hope and purpose â were now hers in
spite of all.
More than one new problem per
turbed her. There was the swarthy
visitor coming and going mysteriously,
closeted with her husband weekly. His
strange entrance into the casa that day
of all days â the stranger ruse that had
been practiced through him upon herâ
t ;actly two days before the arrest at
Beppo for some crime of violenceâ Â«m
event which took place In the factory
of Gelder & Co.. at the very moment,
v.hen i these * busts were belHo made.
Now you deafly Â» see ' the sequence of
events, though you see them, of course.
in - the inverse order to the way in
which they presented themselves to me.
Beppo had the pearl in his possession^
' He may have stolen It from Pletro,
may have been Pietro's confederate,
he. may have been the go-between of
Pietro- and. his sister. It Is of no con
â¢sequence to us which is the correct so
lution.
"The main fact la that he had the
pearl, and at that moment, when it
was en his person, he was pursued by
the police. He made for the factory
in which he worked, and he knew that
he had only a few minufes in which to
conceal this enormously valuable prise,
which would otherwise be found on him
when ,he was searched. dix plaster
casts of Napoleon were drying in thÂ»
passage. One of them was still soft.
In an instant Beppo, a skillful work
man, made a small hole in the wee
plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with
a few, touches covered over the aper
ture once more. It was an admirable
hiding-place. No one could possibly
find it. But Beppo was condemned â¢to
a year's imprisonment, and in the
meanwhile his six busts were scattered
over London. , He could not tell which
contained his treasure. Only by break-
Ing them could he see. Even shaking
' would tell him nothing, for as the pias
ter was wet it was probable that .the
pearl would adhere to it â as, in fact, it
â¢has done. Beppo did not despair, and
he conducted his search with consid
erable ingenuity and perseverance.
Through a cousin who works with
Gelder he found out the retail firms
who had bought the busts. He man
aged to find employment with Morse
Hudson, and In that way tracked down,
three of them. The pearl was " not
there. Then, with the help of somÂ«
Italian employe, he succeeded in find
ing out where the other three bus had
gone. The first was at Harker's. There
hi was dogged by his confederate, who
held Beppo responsible for the loss of
the pearl, and he stabbed him in tha
scuffle which followed."
"If ho was his confederate why
should ha carry his photograph?" I
asked.
"AÂ» a means of tracing him If he
wished to inquire about him from any
third person. That was the obvious
reason. Well, after the murder I cal
culated that Beppo would probably
hurry rathsr than delay his move
ments. He would fear that the police
would read his secret, and so ho
hastened on before they should get
ahead of him. Of course, I could not
pay that he had not found the pearl in
Harker'i bust. I had not- even con
cluded for certain that It was the pearl,
but It was evident la me that he was
looking tut something, since, he carried
the bust past thÂ» other houses in or
der to break it In the garden, which
had a lamp overlooking It. Since Har
ker's bust was one In three, the
chances ware exactly as I to|fj youâ
two to one against the pearl being in
side it. There remained two busts, and
it was obvious that he would go for the
London one first. I warned thÂ» In
mates of the house, go as to avoid a
second tragedy, and we went down
with the happiest results. By that
time, of course, I knew for certain that
It was the Borgia pearl that we were
after. The name of the murdered man
linked the one event with the other.
There only remained a single bustâ the
Reading one â and the pearl must bo
there. I bought It in your presence
from th? owner â and there it lies."
, We Bat In silence for a moment.
.""Well," said Lestrade, "I've gten you
handle a good many cases, Mr. Holmes,
. but I don't know that I over knew a
more workmanlike one than that.
We're not Jealous of you at Scotland
Yard. No, sir; we are very proud of

wouldn't be glad to shake you by the

"Thank you," said Holmes. "Thank
you." and as he turned away It teemed
to me that he wag more nearly moved
by the softer human emotiong than X
had ever seen him. A moment later hÂ»
waa the cold and practical thinker one*
more. "Put the pearl In the safe.
Watson," said he. "and get out th*
papers of the Conk-Singleton forgery
case. Good-by, Lestrada. If any Uttl*
problem cornel your way I shall bÂ«
happy, if I can. to give you a hint ua
two as to Its â¢oiutlcn."
(The End)
seemed to connect him in some occult*
uncanny way with the man of whom,
every hour of day and night, she
mused and dreamed. Thinking of
thia. and weighing her husband's
hatred, at first she hoped Gordon
would not return to Ravenna.
There had befallen another matter,
too, which seemed to have absorbed
much of the old Count's attention, and
which, to her relief, took him from
the city for days at a time.
Teresa knew what this matter was.
In every visit to her father he had
talked of it triumphantly â the rising
of the Italian peoples and the break
ing of the galling yoke of Austria.
During this spring strange rumors
had prevailed. Twice, morning had
found placards posted on the city
walls: "Up with the republic:" and
"Down with the Pope!" The foreign
police were busy; houses were search
ed and more than one Ravennese was
seized under suspicion of membership
in the Carbonari, whose mystic free
masonry* had the secrets of enrolling
bands and stores of powder. Knowl
edge of the sycophant part her hus
band was currently suspected of play
ing came to Teresa bit by bit, in side
long; looks, as her carriage rolled
through the to^wn and more definitely
from Tita. The Austrian wind biew
strongest and Count Guiccioll trimmed
his sails accordingly.
But replete with its one Image, TerÂ«
sa's heart left small space to these
things. Gordon's face flushed her whole
horizon. And as the empty weeks link
ed Â«n, she began, in spite of her fears,
to long passionately to see him again.
That her letter had reached its destina
tion she knew, for the Contessa Albriaai
paused an hour for a visit of state at
the casa â on her way to Rome. But no
word came from its bearer, and each
day Tita returned from the osteria
messageless.
She could not guess the struggle that
had torn Gordon â the struggle between
reasoning conscience and unreasoning
desire â or how fiercely, the letter once
delivered by Fletcher, he had fought
down the longing to return to Ravenna,
which held his child, asxl her. HÂ© had
been able to aid her once, prompted
Desire: she might need him again. If
he stayed away in her troubJe, what
would she deem him? Suppose by
chance she should hear of the orgy he
had witnessed at the osterta? This re
flection maddened him. "Yet," Reason
answered, "not to see her is the only
safety. She is unhappy now; but can
Iâ because life is end-^1 for meâ to
bring her comfort, run th>Â» risk of 9m .
bittering her life further? " So he had
argued.
There came a week for Teresa when
Paolo was summoned to Faenai.
whither her husband had gone two
days before. The espionage of thÂ« casa
relaxed, and on her birthday, with Tita
on the box. she drove alone through
the afternoon forest to the Bagnaea

er Superior, the only mother her chilcfr.
hood had known.

Three weeks age she was quite un
known, a shabby, girlish little creature
with her baby at her breastâ such as
che is even now, but hidden then in the
dim obscurity of poverty.
There came the revelation of the
murder of Biaggio Vilardo, so shock-
Ing, so atrocious, so elemental in Its
brutality that the whole city revolted
and sickened at it.
Then, with the startling prominence
of a single, more-than-life-size figure
thrown upon a screen, Rosa Torturici
is dragged out of her dim obscurity and
thrust into the glare.
She is the wife of the murderer.
She was in that basement-flat where
the butchery was done.
She knows â
What does she know?
She is the only one to lay hold of;
jhe was so near to it that the horror
ri the crime attaches to her.
All the city is saying her name.
When she comes first into the clare
she is regarded with repulsion: there is
something, monstrous, sinister about
the shabby, girlish little creature with
her baby at h^r breastâ and even now
time has softened the feelinsr only into
a distant pity, tinctured with aversion.
tempered with suspicion.
The fiercely dramatic character of the
crime lays hold of your mind whether
you will or not. Each one involuntarily,
reluctantly, irresistibly reconstructs the
scene for himself, sees the swift, heavy
blow of the cleaver, the increasing fury
and terror of the murderer when the
blow has fallen and there is no draw

. Rosa Torturici sits by the grated
prison window, her wide-eyed baby girl
on her lap patting her little hands to
gether and crooning softly.
It is such a fragile, shabby little
figure sitting there, slight as a fifteen
year-old girl's, with the cheap white
shirt-waist untidily flaring Ibose from
the skirt belt, and the black skirt rent
at the knee. It is such a pretty, young,
.appealing face framed in the mass of
brown hair. The skin is of the creamy
tint and texture of a cVlla. The brown
eyes are large . and prominent and
luminous. The long nervous, strain.
perhaps the awful things they may
have looked upon, make them appear to
be starting from the head. In profile
they, are so prominent that you can see
a golden light through the iris. Be
tween the brows the same nervous
strain has knotted a frown into two
deep â¢wrinkles. The chin is round and
small, and. the mouth a soft little bud
that quivers v*ith the overtension of
the nerves and relaxes now and then
into a wan little smile.
These signsâ the starting, brilliant
eyes, the troubled, knotted brows, the
quivering of the lips â are the only evi
dences of emotion she has given ex
cept on that day when she was taken
to the Morgue to look on the mangled
body of her husband's victim and she
tore her way out screaming:
"I have never looked upon one who
has died by the hand of God! Por Dio!
How can I look upon him who has died
âlike that!"
The wide-eyed baby girl slips to the
â floor. and with a confiding smile tacks
her course to me on chubby ' bow legs
to make overtures of friendship, and
Rosa Torturici tells me, by way* of
Judge Spinetti, her attorney, who â  in
terprets for us, her little life story. She
tells it with vivid Italian gestures arid
volubilityâ but the volubility is of nar
rative, not of self-analysis.
She comes from Sicily, yes: from v
Cefalu. ' â¢-:â 'â ' " â¢
Her father. Domenieo Farraco, was a
vineyardlst there, and lived at Cefalu,
which is larger now than it was when
she was a little girl. They lived al
ways in the â  village except - for two
months in the summer, when the whole |
family, father, mother, two sons and V
four daughters, went out with the fam
ily donkey "arid cart, to being in the '
wine and the grapes. ;
She went to the Church of San Gio- :
vanni and made her . confession and â 
got her confirmation in Cefalu.
Can she read and write?
. Oh." yes; she says -with animated
pride. She is quite educated. She went
to the Government school of Cefalu. i
and not only that, there -were asDira- .
â you must know how great a dis
tinction it is for the poor Sicilian.-for
the peasant Sicilian, U- be able to read ;
and write to appreciate the dizzy |
height of these aspirations: there were :
aspirations' in the family for. her to be
come a teacher. Her mother. Leonora
Serrio," which means "serious." wished
her to be a teacher, and she not only
went to the Government school, but she
studied at home with a private teacher
to help her on. 'â  ;. . \
And â¢ her family, she ! goes on ,with '
innocent pride, -all her family are edu- :
cated.
I So. too. testified Crispino Vilardc. â¢
the brother. of the murdered man. at ,
the inquest. He said that her family in \
Sicily, were all "fine people." i
Yes, she smiles that is true: not one
of thorn ever had to go to some one
else to get a letter written, or read.
Every one of them can read and writeâ
they are quite educated. "
And little Rosa, after she had made
her confession and got confirmed by
the padre of San Giovanni, and had
become educated so that she success
fully passed the examination of the
elementary school, came to this coun
try. ; . '; ; - .
Her father, had come here â  before,
and after making money enough in the
orange groves of . Louisiana had sent
for his family.
And Rosas thirteenth birthday was
r assed on shipboard on the Atlantic.
And then when she was fifteen years -
old another great event happened.
All the family, the father, the mother,
and sisters and . brothers, r were*out for *
a Sunday jaunt -In- their waeon. in

saw for the first time Pietro Torturici.
He was on a Sunday outing, too. andâ
whether it was the Sunday clothes, or
the Sunday gayety, or just fate, he
made up his mind as soon as he set
eyes on her that he would have her

munificent sum of $47 a month in a

Rosa demurred; she. was too -young.,
she could wait; she would know him

mother, Eleonora, urged â¢ her not to let
the chance slip by. . "A girl must marry

Pietro Torturici came for ; his , an
swer himself. She remembered the day
well. She was standing by the window
combing her younger sister's hair, and
he came to the outside of the window
and asked her to speak for herself. He
wanted no go-betweens. She hung her ;
head, and looked away, 1 and would not
say yes â nor } yet no. But It must be
yes or no, and straight \to him. fU He
didn't want her father I and mother to
make up her mind for her- o So â she
looked at him againâ fand; looked away'
and said yes she would marry him. :
. Th<?n,* after a little while-her father
and mother ' were as much opposed to
her marrying him as they: had been in
favor of it. â  â¢ - 'â  â  â â  ' â¢ â 'â "â *. 'â â *'
Why? â¢ ' '"â¢â  %'% ' \:Vf}.. â  ,"â¢ â -' â¢
Because â  Torturici , was so boyish, so
full of fun,. so. light-headed and light
hearted. ' Why, he skipped- rope and
played ball and made 'jokes and whit
tled and sang like one of the little boys.
But she liked that in him as much
as the father and mother disliked it;
and now that they had put him in ; her
Way and urged her to marry him she
had learned â¢to love ' him, and, say
what they pleased,', she would. marry
him. . ':'â  -r
Â» So- they were married at the Church
of St. Bernardo in New Orleans just
three months after the day they met
on the Sunday jaunt. She was just a
' few months 1 , over 15, and he was 18.
That was a little more than five years
ago. H^jgJaSS *

When he had money nothing was too

Once he had all of a thousand dollars
âin hillsâ saved up, she believes, out of

table d'hote dinners when he had
work.
And the baby came.
And the rent of those two dingy
basement rooms at 710 Montgomery
street could not be paid. The butcher,
the baker and the grocer were not too
cordial about charging things â some-,*
times they wouldn't charge them.
They moved to 736^ Green street.
They took Yilardo as a lodger, and
then
The awful thing that sent a shudder
â 
through the whole cit â¢ happened.
No, no; not in all the time she had
known him and been wife to him had
she thought he could do such a ter
rible deed. Nothing had ever suggest
ed the possibility of it.
He would get angry with her. oh, ter
ribly angry; fly up with a flash like
a can of powder when a match is
dropped in. He was impulsive â yes; so
quick â and like mad. But in a moment
it was over â he would cry, yes. cry,
and say he was sorry for being unkind
to her.
And now, after having done this
thing, if he was any sort of a man, if
he had ever loved her and the baTsy, he
would come back and present himself,
so that she might go free.
She spread the morning paper out on
her knee, smoothing it where her pic
ture and the baby's were displayed upon
the page, and pointing to it said with
feverish earnestness to Judge Spinetti
and to me.
"Yes, if he is any sort of a man and'
he sees thisâ that I who am innocent
and the baby to which he is father are
here, in prison, he will come back; no
matter where he is, he will come back
and present himself, bo that we shall
not suffer the punishment."
It is perhaps a childish conception of
chivalry and duty, but Rosa Torturici's
is not a complex mind.
Whether she knows much or little of
that shocking crime, whether or no
she had an awful share in it, volun
tarily or involuntarily, who shall say?
Not I, for one; for it is not given to a
mere newspaper woman to read the
naked human heart.
Only three could unravel the mys
tery of it all â Vilardo, Pietro Torturici
and his wife, Rosa, and Vilardo is
dead.
Was It because of the sin of Rosa
Torturici? Did she fall through her
soft affection? She is such a pretty
little creature, and beauty allied with
weakness makes its appeal to man.
Was it in a transport of jealousy that
death was dealt in such fearful form to
Vilardo? â¢
Was it because the rent could not

be paid for the two mean little rooms
at 710 Montgomery street?/ Because
there was no longer credit with the
butcher, the baker and the grocer?
Because there was not even the mac
aroni and tomato paste and pepper
paste to set upon the bare table â and
Vilardo's savings offered the one so
lution to the grinding problem how to
ifve?
Or was it the vengeance of ; the
Mafia?
The upper-class Italians laugh at
any mention of the Mafia? There is
no Mafia, they tell you.
"There Is no such thing as Mafia
in San Francisco," says C. F. Gron
dona of the Columbia Banking Com
pany, which holds the savings of the
Italian colony, Sicilians and all. "Why
should there be Mafia here? That is
a thing'of the past in Italy."
"Mafln!" says Carlo del -Pino of
L'ltalia, "What does any one mean by
Mafia? Why. if two or three or four
or five agree together to do a thing,
bind themselves together for the pur
pose of vengeance, that is a Mafia.
But big secret organizationâ here; oh,
no."
"If there is Mafia here I should
know it," says Judge Spinetti, "for
my practice is in criminal cases.
There, is no Mafia here. Once only do
I remember any one connected with
the Mafia â that was Vincenzo TropÂ»
oni. who threw cayenne pepper into an
officer's face to let his prisoner escape.
He was sentenced and served his
timeâ and never had anything to do
with Maria after that."
On the other hand there was that
affair with Italy over the killing of
Chief of Police Hennessey in New Or
leans In" 1891. Eleven men were
lynched in the Sicilian quarter in New
Orleans as the result of that, hanged
to telegraph poles, while women waved
approval from their balconies to those
who took the law into their own hands.
It cost the United States a pretty
penny In indemnity, which" is some
proof of a Mafia.
There was the murder mystery of
Jackson Park, in Chicago, not so very
long ago, where an Italian was found
dead from a poignard thrust with an
"M" cut in the snow by his side. What
did that mean?
From the time of the middle ages
there has been that secret power in
Italy that has driven terror and the
stiletto to the hearts of authorities
unapproved.
It has been driven south in Italy
by an increasing liberality and free
derm and enlightenment until its
remaining stronghold is conceded to
be Sicily, where the people, with their
admixture of the Oriental and the
African, offer' a temperament peculi
arly susceptible to its teachings.
My vegetable' dealer tells me, "They
stick you quirk in SicTly," and he
comes from Palermo.
More learned authority says that
"people of every rank, profession and
occupation, who have no other ties,
unite for their common interest, with
out regard to law, justice or public
order. They believe that they can
best prov'de for the safety of their
own persons and of their prop
erty by their own strength and per
sonal influence, independent of all
authority and of all law."
That is a nice, scholarly way of
putting it. but the Mafia maxims that
are the common conversational ex
change of Sicily are more character
istic.
"The poor." they say. "resort to
force, fools resort to law."
"Take the life of whoever makes
you* lose the means of living."
"Be respectful to officers of the law,
but stand afar off.
"An influential friend is worth more
than I^ooo lire in your pocket."
"Imprisonment, sickness and mis
fprtune prove the hearts, of friends."
"The truth is only told in the con
fessional."
HELEN
DARE
Italy says she doesn't want the Ma
fia. All Sicily is the home of the Ma
fia. The constant preasure has
squeezed over 30,000 Sicilians out of
Sicily into this country.
They are still Sicilians, still Maflosi.
The leopard, it is said, does pot
change his spots â even by emigration.
It may be that it was the arm of
the Mafia that struck down Vilardo.
It may be that it was need or jeal
ousy.
The awful thing was done and Rosa
TorturicJ, wnose mmd is not complex
nor refined to splitting hairs in .the
problems of life, what did she do?
It is known at least that she labor
ed at removing the traces of the
crime â the blood-soaked apron, the
little handprint on the floor. the
washing of clothes all tell that.
It is" known that when the detec
tives went from house to house seek
ing an owner for .he shawl she kept
her own counsel.
That she confessed to knowing of
no missing lodger.
That she did not go to the police and
denounce her husband as a murderer
is also true.
That she has been sullen and secre
tive is true.
But she is not a very advanced
woman, not educated to very high
standards of public duty. I fear.
She only acted upon her instincts of
wifely duty, perhaps.
If It had been your husband, the
father of your baby â of course, that's
quite an impossible supposition â but
if it hail been, what would you have
doTie in her ;>lace?
I put a rather cruel question to
Rosa Torturici" as I said good- by. I
asked her, and Judge Spinetti inter
preted it with great care, what she
would do if Torturici came back.
That it seems to me- â for life is so
complex â a harder question to decide
than what to do when he went away.
Quick upon the heels of* the ques
tion tame her answer. She has no
two minds about the matter. She
knows what she wants to do.
"If he comes back â and he should
come back ard release me from this
place" â in her ignorance she believed
that she would be kept in prison until
Torturici was found â "I never want
to see him again. Never! Never! I
want to get out of here. I want to go
away from San Francisco, where this
thing happened. I want to get away
from all that will make me remem
ber it.
"I just want to take my baby and
go home to my mother."JEWISH PASSOVER
WHAT "KOSHER" MEANS
THE Jewii-h Passover, which be
gan last Wednesday at sunset,
will be celebrated by Hebrews all
over the world with the same
ceremonies that tradition tells us
vere the practices of the ancient Jews.
No feast In the Hebrew calendar is of
greater Importance; for the Passover
fcigniflee to every Hebrew the Deliver
ance of the beloved children of Israel,
the chosen of the Lord, from the bond
age of the Egyptians. Even under cir
cumstances of extreme adversity the
Passover festival has l>een observed.
The liberty-loving Americans could not
celebrate the Fourth of July, the birth
of our independence, with more sin
cere feeling than that with which the
Hebrew, the first t<> strike for liberty,
brings to his celebration of the Pass
over. Unlike our Independence day,
however, the Passover stands not for
political independence, but for freedom
of religious thought. For days before
the festival the Hebrew housewife is
preparing her home for the ereat event,
scrubbing floors and cupboards, and
cleaning every spot in the h<. U se. Not
a bit of leaven must be found on the
day of the Passover, not any utensil
used that has been employed with
leaven food.
On the morning of the festival eve
the master of the house goes from room
to room, performing the peculiar cere
mony called Byur Chometz: that is. re
moving the leaven or chometz. No one
Is ever permitted to partake of bread
or other leaven substance or liauid
after 10 o'clock in the mornlne preced
ing the feast, until the evening cere
mony.
On the evening of the first two niehts
of Passover the males of the family at
tend the synagogue, while the women
prepare the table for the seder. The
seder, or order <>f service, beeinÃ with
the sanctification of the wine. God is
thanked for tlie delights and blessines
of life, and for having relieved the Is
raelites from the Egyptian yoke. Then
all at the table arise. Each person
takes hold of the plate containing the
unleavened bread, while the master re
peats the service. In Jewish households
it is the custom to bless the wine on
the Sabbath eve. and on festival occa
sions- Over it is pronounced the bless
ing of sanctiflcation. The two loaves
of bread always placed upon the table
in every Jewish household at the Sab
bath meal are typical of the two por
tions of manna gathered by the Israel
ites on the Sabbath eve in the wilder
ness.
To any student the religious ceremo
nies of the Jews would be interestins.
The Jewish teachers inculcate the doc
trine that Judaism is the relirion of
life, not death, and tesch us to enloy
the blessings th* Lord has provided to
hlÂ» people during their sojourn unon
earth. As in other religions, however.
there are ascetics among the Hebrews
who by no means pass their lives as if
this were merely a world of pleasure,
but spend their days in penitence and
mortification.
fy CATTERED through the "City of
V^. Restaurants," as San Francisco
v~~ 1 likes to call itself, are numerous
X-"/ restaurants distinguished by the
* title 'Kosher." Some of them are
in the Ghetto, that quarter of the city
in the neighborhood of Sixth and How
ard streets; one is on Taylor street, one
on Eddy street and others in various
sections.
While the majority understand that
the "kosher" restaurants have some
thing to do with the Jewish religion,
few have real knowledge ot what the
â word implies. The sign "Kosher Res
taurant" has no further meaning to the
uninitiated than to emphasize the fact
hat the mode of cooking in such a
â¦afe is in strict accordance with the
dietary laws of the Jews. In other
words it means that the food cooked In
such a restaurant, as in the Jewish
home, is fit and proper, which is the
literal translation of the word kosher.
What is not kosher, according to the
Jews, is "tcmeh" or unclean; if clean,
it is "lo tomeh." There are but few^
Jews nowadays who live absolutely up
to the laws of kosher.
â  During the Passover season, the or
thodox Jews live up to old Biblical
admonitions very strictly, but the re
formed Hebrews by no means believe
they should do the same. Certain
dishes are cooked and eaten only during
the Passover, the institution of which
is fully described in Exodus, and
which commemorates the "passing
over" of the plague In Egypt without
injury to the faithful of the Lord. This
is the feast of unleavened bread, the
bread known as matzos.
It is a popular fallacy that pork
must not be offered to a Jew at a meal.
Any one reading up the Scriptures will
find that terrapin is equally abhorrent
to an orthc-dox Jew. The original mean-
Ing, as already, stated, of the word
kosher was "fit," "proper. '' In rabbini
cal literature it had the meaning of
"fit, ' "permitted " in contradistinction
to "posul" and "terefah" (unfit, forbid
den). Extensively used in the Halakah,
the word crept into the common par
lance of the Jews, and the verb "kash
eren" wag formed to denc-te any pro
cess by which vessels for food were
made ritually fit for use. Thus, the
process of cleansing vessels for the
Passover festival is known by that
term; also the process of immersing in
a ritual bath new metal vessels bought
from a nove-Jew. "Kosheren" is es
pecially applied to the ritual prepara
tion c-f meat. In order to soften meat
before it is salted so as to allow the
salt to extract the blood more freely,
the meat is soaked in water for about
half an hour. It is then covered with
salt for an hour and afterward washed
three times. The whole process is des
ignated by the term "kosheren."
The word kosher has domesticated it
self to Jewish dietary laws, in accord
ance with the Biblical and rabbinical
regulations concerning forbidden food.
The ancient Israelites lived chiefly on
vegetable food and fruit, on which the
Bible places no restriction. Among the
early Hebrews animal food was par
taken of by the common people only on
festival occasions. Some of the Tanaim
were of the opinion that during their
journey through the wilderness the Is
raelites were permitted to eat the meat
of only such animals as had previous
ly been sacrificed, some portions of
which had been burned on the altar,
and some given to the priests. The law
of sacrifices is very fully laid out in
the seventh chapter of Leviticus. The
Bible, in its legislative portions, makes
explicit provisions for the distinction
between clean and unclean animals.
These are all in the eleventh chapter of
Leviticus.
And the lord spake unto Moses and to
Aaron, paying untu them. Speak unto the
children of Israel, saying: TheÂ»Â« are the
beasts which ye shall eat among all the
beasts that are on the earth. Whatsoever
parteth the haof, and Is cloven-footed, and
cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall
ye cat .
Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them
that chew the cud, or of them that divide
the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth
in* cud but dlvideth not the hoof; he la un
clean unto you.
And the coney, because he cheweth the
cud. but dlvideth not the hoof; he is unclean
unto you.
And the hare, because he cheweth the cud,
but dlvideth npt the hoof; be is unclean unto
you.
And the swine, thotiffh he divide the hoof
and be cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the
cud; he is unclean unto you.
Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their
carcase shall ye not touch- they are un
clean to you.
These shall ye eat of all that are In the
waters: Whatsoever hath fins and scales in
the waters in the seas and in the rivers, them
shall ye eat.
And all that have not fins and scales in the
**as end in the rivers, of all that move in
the waters, and of any living thing which
Is la the waters, they shall be an abomina
tion unto you. They shall be even an abotn
laatlon unto you; ye shall not eat of their
flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in
abomination. Whatsoever hath no fin? nor
scales in the waters, that shall be an abom
ination unto you.

: . One .of the strictest fot) the ' Jewish
dietary laws applies] to the ; preparation i;
of meat. The blood must be drawn and
the meat properly salted or else It is not t
. kosher. The mode of killing also enters 5
: : into the proper preparation. The kosher
butcher shops, of which the kosher res- >
' taurants and the orthodox "i' Jews buy ;
I their meat, obtain the : animals from the j
ordinary slaughter-houses, but the beef r
is not killed in the ordinary i way. On |
j Mondays, Wednesdays | and : Fridays *in <
â¢ the i morning or afternoon one may ; see s
â  cattle slaughtered fin the kosher] fash
; ion. It ]is 1 certainly â¢ more humane than
the way the other animals meet their
deaths, and 1 there is every argument in ~
; its favor. It â is more . than probable ! that ;
the cattle are slaughtered In this way I
to | insure 'their s being ' healthy. About :
twenty head , a .week . are killed ; for-the ?
"kosher" 6hops. The animal ]is * driven t
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU.
itUo" a sued and, Â«*.^Â»ut one of its fore
legs is placed an iron ring, while a rope
is tied about its legs in such a way
that It cannot struggle. The sochet,
tht rabbi deputed to kill the animal, is
provided with a sharp knife of peculiar
shape, being square instead of curved
at the end. With this weapon he severs
the /uguiar vein at one stroke, the ani
mai's death being instantaneous. It. is
this quick death that is supposed to
conduce- to the purity of the flesh. The
blood tlbws from the neck in a steady
strÂ«am for perhaps fifteen minutes, and
then the carcass is hung up, with the
head downward, so that if there is any
mere blood to now it will come from the
neck. The heart, liver and entrails are
carefully examined to discover possible
impurities, and if any of these appear
the animal-* is rejected as not kosher.
If it is all right it is blessed by the
rabbi who killed it, and a label in He
brew characters is pasted upon it. In
the cold room-,., where the beeves are
placed after the killing, the kosher law
is also carefully observed. Everything
is pure according to the Biblical in
junction. The actual slaughtering must
be done by an ordained rabbi. For
twenty years Rabbi M. Golden has per
formed the killing for the kosher meat
at one slaughter-house.
It is forbidden to use the milk of un
clean animals which suffer from some
visible malady. When, after the Jewish
ritual slaughtering, an animal appar
ently sound during its life is found to
have been diseased, its milk or cheese
made of its milk is fqrbldden as food.
Now that the agitation about pure food
1h absorbing so much of the public's
attention, these laws of the ancient
Jev?s do not appear, so harsh as they
would a few years ago. Indeed they
appear wholly dictated by common
sense. Eggs of unclean birds, or birds
suffering from a visible sickness, are
forbidden. The rabbis laid down the
Israel's Ancient Kits* and symbolic jranc
lions as practised, amor^ tine ortnodopc
amid tke scenes of Modern American
following as one sign In regard to the
law: "If both ends of the egg are
sharp or round, or if the yolk is outside
and the white inside, it Is of an unclean
bird." The roe of unclean fishes is
also forbidden. Blood, which Is sup
posed to contain the vital element, is
repeatedly forbidden in the Bible, and
not only blood itself, but flesh contain
ing blood, is forbidden. This prohibi
tion applies only to the blood of animals
or of.blrds, not to the blood of fishes or
of locusts. Only the blood which is
contained in the veins or congealed
upon the surface of the meat is forbid
den. As long as it Is ti part of the meat
it may be eaten. The three-fold repe
tlon of the law prohibiting the seething
of a kid in its mother's milk is explain
ed by the rabbis as referrir.gr to three
distinct prohibitions; casting meat and
milk together. Animal fat is forbidden.
Milk must not be drunk for two hours
after meals.
There are a great many delicious
dishes prepared for Jewish consump
tion that would commend themselves to
epicures of all religions if they only
knew of them, but to the majority of
people they are utterly unknown. For
instance, ha^ many would think of
asking a butcher for a haslet? This
means the liver, heart, lung and milt.
The liver is generally cut off and the
rest thrown away, unless especially
asked for by a customer. There Is a
restaurant down in the business quar
ter which, though not strictly "kosher,"
makes a specialty of preparing certain
Jewish dishes. It Is frequented between
11 asd 3 by prominent bankers and
brokers and other men who are num
bered among our epicures. From the
bill of fare of this place one can select
such distinctively Jewish dishea. M
Wiener schnitzel, filled magen or stuffed,
milt and sauerkraut. German fricadells
and mushroom sauce, Swiss sausage
and mashed potatoes, cold salmon with
raisin sauce, sour beef with potato pan
cake, Koenigsberger klops with caper
sauce, sour lung and potato pancake,
chopped Wiener schnitzel with paprika*
sauce, Wiener meat roll with sauer
kraut. lungennuss with egg. In neatly
all Jewish and German households they
know how to prepare these dishes, but
to the French chef or the American
cook who prides herself on her knowl
edge of dainty cooking, they are dishea
unknown. From a '"kosher" chef the
writer obtained the following recipes:
Cold salmon with raisin sauce (a. fa
vorite Jewish dish). â The salmon is left
whole, or cut in slices, boiled", then
drained and laid on a dish. The sauce
is prepared In the following way:
Brown a piece of butter in the frying
pan with a chopped onion and a little
sugar. Soak a bit of honey cake In a
cup of sour claret and add to the other
ingredients in saucepan, with pepper,
salt and a little ground ginger; also
two slices of lemon, one-half cup.- of
raisins and a bay leaf. Cook slowly
and then pour over the fish. 3erva
cold.
Stuffed milt (another typical Jewtstt
dish.) â There are two veins inside the
milt which must be taken out and then
it is scraped. To the- intide is added
soaked bread, egg. onion,, chopped par
sley and seasoning to taste; ail mixed
together, and then sewed up. This
is placed in boiling soup for half art
hour, taken out and browned, and is
ready to serve.
Sour lung is an appetizing dish. Pre
pare the lung by first thoroughly clean-
Ins;, then ball until soft. Throw away
the water and cut the lung into small
squares. Put fat in the saucepan and
brown an onion. Add (tour, a table
spoonful of sugar and two of vinegar.
Make smooth by adding one cup of
meat stock and season with ginger,
pepper, salt, a bay leaf and chopped
parsley. The lung is then placed in the
pan and all cooked slowly together for
twenty minutes. Boiled beef can be
prepared in the same W3y. Another
munner is to prepare lung like hash,
substitute soaked bread for. potatoes
and serve on toast.
The - heart, chopped ss in hash,
sometimes with the lung and sometimes
by Itself, is another favorite kosher
dish.JOTTINGS OF OLD LIM JUCKLIN
OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE
AGED
had begun to creep up
out of the valley. The day was
breathful \>f scents not yet quite
ripe enough for perfume. It was
as a youth, delightful in promises. In
the courthouse yard, in the county
town, beneath the locust trees, there
sat the County Judge, several old law
yers, the oldest man in the village and
Limuel Jucklin. In the spring, when
we see the renewal of nature's pur
poses, we talk of opportunity. We feel
that we are to have one more chance.
The old man's blood, the reminiscent
sap of a declining life, is quicker. "Op
portunity ,is ever present," said Juck
lin. "It is one of the staples in life's
storehouse. Man doesn't need to make
opportunity. It's here anyhow. He
can't make it. He can sometimes ar
range combinations, but he doesn't
have to create the material. Opportu
nity throws its light into the eye of the
young fellow. It's like the glow
worm. He can't help seem' it, more
or less. It is the old feller that
needs to have opportunity pointed out
to him. His 6ight has failed him and
he cant see the light. Youth don't
need encouragement. It's own swift
blood encourages it. What we ought to
do is to encourage age."
â Then you think the old man ought
to have a chance?" said the County
Judge.
"That's exactly what I think. And
thÂ« young chap ought to be interested,
since if he lives he is soon to be old. It
won't be half as long a-comin' as he
thinks it will, lookin* forward. We are
too much inclined to compliment the
old folks for what they have done and
then politely, and sometimes even im
politely, tell them to stand aside to
keep from being run over by the pro
cession. It is true that the okl man
ain't supple enough for a drum major,
but he can beat a bass drum a. long
time after some people think he can't
and out of the fife he may get a mighty
sweet tune. But of course the proces- i
sion is in a hurry and can't be expected
to wait on him. I don't say it should
wait. However, it ought not to tread
on the Md man simply because it is in
a hurry."
"A feller came in one of drivin* a
horse over me the other day," said an
old man, too literal to see a spiritual
Inference. "And I yelled at him, I did,
and told him that if I could call back
about twenty years I'd give him a,
thrashin*. That's what I told him."
"And right there was where you '
were doin" yourself an injustice," L'm i
replied. "You were makin' yourself
older. You went back into the past. It
would have been better if you had told
him' that if he were twenty years older ,
you would thrash him. Never go back
to where you were, but bring things
to where you now stand. Remember
one thingâ that it is mind instead of
physical activity that has made this
world great, and that as long as a
man feeds his mind it will grow. One '
of the greatest of men that lived away
before the Savior paid that age ai- (
ways has youth enough left to learn.
And as long as we learn we' grow. If
we forget old things let us learn new
ones. The egotist gets old quicker
than anybody else for the reason that '
he thinks he knows it all. Ignorance is
always old; wisdom is always young.
Many y<?ars ago there lived a man
named Louis Canaro. At 40 he
thought himself old enough to die.
His health was bad. He had worn him
self out. But he had sense enough not
to believe that he knew it all. So he
began to diet himself. He ate Just as
much as was good for him. He discov
ered that his appetite was treacherous
and called for more food than was
necessary. Then he took up a system
of readltig. He made it a point to
learn somethin' out of a book or out
of nature every day. Well, at 90
he wrote ;t book, and It was a good'
one. too. It was filled with the keen-
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL 1 .
OPIE READ
est sense. .No one that has ever writ
ten on life has beaten it. Then he
waited ten years and wrote another
book, just to see if he could. The book
was strong, full of funâ a smile. And
it tickled him so that he laughed for
three years before he died. He never
did anything until he was old. The
your-gsters could thrust aside his body,
but his mind wouldn't be thrust. He
kf-pt it active with learnin' things."
"E*ut," said the County Judge, "don't
you believe that a man's brain grows
old?"
"Oh, yes; and so does his hair, if
he keeps it; and so does his house.
But the brain isn't the mind and the
house is not his life. If the brain
were the mind, the man with the
heaviest brain would have the great
est mind. Webster had a heavy
brain, and these fellers that make
much of that sort of thing raised a
great to-do over it; but while they
â were in the midst of their wonder a
negro was hanged for murder. They
THE LIKENESSES OF CHRIST
f~*y INCE Christ lived and moved up-
Vot on the earth men have tried to
Vl visualize him with their inner
eyes; since there has been a
Christian church at all there haÂ«
been an ideal of Christ. And by the
ideal of Christ we do not mean only the
spiritual ideal, not the material, not
merely the soul, not the body. Who
can read the tender and terrible record
of the Galilean peasant without won
dering whet he looked likeâ in what
guise he appeared to Mary and Martha
and the disciple* who loved him and to
Pilato who judged him?
In his manger doubtless he looked like
other babiesâ we like to think so. And
we may even fancy him while he grew
up to be a slender boy. with the wis
dom of many worlds shining in his eyes
as he taught the doctors in the temple.
But what manner of man was lie who.
bent abo-ve the Magdalen with divinest
pity and raised Lazarus from the dead?
What was the face that the adoring
disciples saw at" the Last Supper, that,
in its godlike patience, broke the heart
of his mother as she looked up into it
upon the eross â that tortured the
memory of Judas so that "he went and
hanged himself"?
We all know the "conventional
Christ," which has been co-pied and re
created through the centuries. We
clothe, the vision of our inspirations in
the form and likeness of this type, hav
ing no other, and being able to picture
no nobler Ideal. Yet we ask ourselves
sometimes, "Is this Indeed the Christ
of Gaiilee, the Christ of Jerusalem, the
Christ of Calvary? Why," we question,
"<-ho"Jld the pictures resemble him
these paintings by men who were born
centuries after he died?"
But now comes the artist, a thinker
and a rarely devout follower of Christ,
who asserts that these are not imagin
ary likenesses, built up by artists upon
a conventional ideal, but solemn wit
nesses of an indestructible traditionâ
unchanging reproductions of one divine,
never to be forgotten Face â that they
one and all are based upon a likeness
which, by easy, burden of proof, may
be hailed as authenticâ the portrait of
Christ.
The man who has undertaken to
prove this- to the world is Sir Wyke
Bayliss, K. 8., F. S. A., president of
the Royal Society of British Artists He
has written several valuable books up
on art and its history, but the volume
in which he has presented the surpris
ing and interesting theory which we
art at present considering is called
"Rex Regum, a Palmer's Study of the
Likeness of Christ from the Time of
the Apostles to the Present Day."
Sir Wyke Bayliss is an enthusiast and
h-j Is also- a logician of the idealist type
He is possessed of a fine fervor of con
viction himself, and seems anxious to
communicate it to a doubting and un
certain world. While admitting that no
article of the creed, and no essential
principle of the church hangs upon the
truth or falsity of the likeness i/f Christ
weighed his brain and found that it
was a third heavier than Webster's.
He was not only a murderer, but was
little short of bein' an idiot. No, sir;
the mind isn't physical. It doesn't
have much c-f kinship with the body.
Alexander Stephens was almost a
dwarf. The poet Byron wore a six
and a auarter hat. But old Bill San
derson thfÂ£ lives out here hasn't more
than sense enough to drive up the
calves and he- can't get a hat in town
big enough for him. A man is use
ful as long as he can think. He
thinks as long as he .learns. When
he gives up his mind, why, his mind
gives him up. Old men talk too
much and read too little. -The mind
needs food. And this mind food is
not to be raked up out of tire past â
of, your own life. The past is wonh
nothin' except as it serves as a light
for the future. This has been said
more than once, but that doesn't make
it less true. An old man dreams that
he is young. It is rare that he dreams
of bein' older. And In his dream of
youth great ideas sometimes come to
him. He awakes younger, but his
disappointment at findin' himself still
old robs his mind of the freshness it
drew from the dream. Sometimes a
suddenly awakened determination
will make a man younger. There
was old Buck Jamieson. He was
not only shoved aside, but jammed
he seems to feel that the face of the
Master should be a reality to every
Christian; that a knowledge of what
he looked like as a man has a deep
rooted value in the worship of him as.
a god.
The fact, too, that this matter has
been the object of su much discussion
and conjecture In the past has strength
ened his determination to establish the
facts forever. To do this he has in the
course of some two hundred odd papers
forged a chain, of which some links are
or gold, some irc.-n and some, as he ad
mits, of wire-like fragility â a chain of
testimony.
He has met with great opposition,
even with a storm of protest, the Ag
nostic Journal in England taking a
particularly keen pleasure in deriding
his theories, but he has also received
the appreciation of numbers of great
and good, wise i nd witty men, as well
as awakened the interest of the worlfl
at large.
This theory of his is of importance, or
should be. not only to churchmen but
to all who are interested in the Scrip
tures from a historical or literary
standpoint, and artists all over the
world will read attentively the testi
mony of countless generations of reli
gious painters. The painters are Sir
Wyke Bayliss' chief witnesses, "for,"
he says, quoting the great Farrar,
" 'Art cannot deceive.' "
Sir Wyke tells of a certain "venerable
minister" who protested against his
theory on the ground that he could
never beiieve that the Holy Spirit could
have permitted an artist to paint the
face of Christ.
"It does not seem to have occurred
tc- this clergyman." remarks Sir Wyke.
"that the Holy Spirit has permitted the
face of Christ to be painted. * * *
and that the only question at issue is
whether the representations thus per
mitted are true or false!" He also adds
that in othor questions the Holy Spirit
is generally considered to be on the
side of truth!
A certain English Bishop, who was a
professor of archaeology as well, says
that the artist "has a power of seeing
resemblances and detecting a prevalent
type" which he is quite without. He
adds that he is willing to trust Sir
Wyke's esthetic -perceptions in the
. matter. Most persons, as a matter of
fact, are able to trace the similarities
perceived by Sir Wyke. if not by the
Bishop, and a perusal of "Rex Regum "
leaves the most skeptical in a frame
of m'nd closely bordering upon convic
tionâa conviction which may have in
it, of course, as much cnthifsiasm as
reason.
Sir Wyke's argument is carried on
along the following lines:
"A man born a~d educated in a
Christian country is in the position of
(,-ne who inherits his father's house â a
mansion built centuries ago, containing
many rooms, in the chief of which, and
occupying the place, of honor, hangs
a beautiful picture which from his
childhood he has believed to be the
portrait of the founder of his family.
This portrait is an heirloom of price
less value and goes with the title deeds
of his estate.
"But a day comes when the man
finds that he has outgrown his estate
or his inheritance is disputed. The
against the fence. Well, one day he
got into a row with a feller younger
than himself â forgot his age and
whipped him. Then he went home
and caught his horse and put thi plow
gep.r on him.
" 'Why, Buck,' said his wife, 'what
on earth are you goin' to do?'
" 'I'm goin' out in the field to \ low.
Th;<t bottom ffeld is mightil; in the
grnsÂ«=.'
" 'Why, Buck,' says she. 'you cant
plo\v.' #
" 'Can't? who said so?'
"But you're too old.'
"'ls that so?' said Buck, find v.ith
that he went on out into the fir d and
plowed. The neighbors were astonished;
but Buck kept on a ntowin' ii.d 1 leck
on if he hadn't been killed tiyin' to
break a colt he would have b.en plow
in" till yet."
"Tried to. break a colt/ 1 said the
Judge. '"That shows that ag? went tou
far."
"Yes, but it showed also that ajrr
was young again or it wouldn't have
gone too far. Nothin' is a better proof
of youth than to go too far. And that
brings us down to an important point.
Youth goes too far and age doesn't go
far enough as a general thing. It is
when a man strikes a compromise be
tween the two that he has reached his
best. But his best lasts longer than
some folks suppose. It is said that the
house is appraised and with it the por
trait. Then arises the question of its
authentic-it j. "It is naught, it is
naught.' saith the buyer, as he has al
ways been saying since the days of the
wise king. The picture was painted so
long ago that nobody living has ever
seen the painter or the face which it
represents. Perhaps it was manufac
tured in Wardour street fc/r the purpose
of giving a semblance of reality to a
doubtful pedigree, as they say the like
ness' of Christ was made up in the dark
ages for the purpose of giving sub
stance to the story of the divine life
on earth. Perhaps it is the fictitious
substitute for an original long ago lost
ot stolen or sold by the family, or de
stroyed by fire.
"It may even be the very painting
mentioned in the title deeds, and yet so
decayed by time or changed by so
called restoration as to have become
worthless as a picture and unrecog
nizable as a likeness.
"Mow shall any certainty be attained
as to the value or thÂ« authenticity of
this portrait? The following questions
are asked and have to be answered. I
place them side by side with similar
questions touching the likeness of
Christ. In either case reasonable an
swers shouid carry conviction:
"Iâ The tradition of the familyâ How
far is it to be trusted? The witness of
the churchâ how far is it to be believed?
"II â Portraits, said to be of the same
man, are possessed by other branches
â¢A the familyâ do they bear a common
itsemblance? Likenesses, believed to be
of <"hrist, are regarded as authentic by
different churches â do they bear a com
mon similitude?
"Illâ Were the artists of the period
when this man lived capable of paint
ing such a picture? Were the artists
of the first century capable of paint
ing the likeness of Christ?
"IV â Is there any reason to think
that the heir had any interest in con
cealing or in falsifying this man's like
ness? Is there any reason for suppos
ing that the early Christians desired
the face of Christ to be unknown or to
be forgotten?
"V â Is it a question between this por
trait and another, or is it betweeSi this
and :iofte? Is it a question between
this and some other likeness, dr is it
between this and none?
"VI â What is the opinion of acknowl
edged experts in the art of portraiture '
How was the likeness of Christ regard
ed by the masters of the Renaissance?
. "Vllâ Here is a miniature. It has
been hidden away in a secret drawer,
and is inscribed with the man's initials.
Is it the same likeness? Here are some
portraits from the graves of the first
Christian martyrs. They are inscribed
with Christ's initials. Is the UKeness
the same?
"VIII â Is there any theory to ac
count for the poj trait except that it is
a likeness? Is there any theory to ac
count for the likeness except that it Is
a portrait?"
One by one Sir Wyke answers the
foregoing questions in such a way as to
leave them no longer open. He proves
: that for twenty centuries all Christian
churches and Christian peoples have
preserved the one tradition as to
Christ's likeness: that its history is an
I integral part of the history of the
most of the poetry is written by young
men. I reckon this is true. But the
must of the poetry isn't worth readin'

takes them to write it. The most

through all the whirl and clash of
changing creeds and warring dogmas
no 'â¢ man has ever been able to change
the accepted ideal ;of the Nazarene.
From the beginning, when the word of
Christ was not yet a world- wide essen
tial of civilization and fact of life.' the.
likeness was ?â  -nevertheless : recognized,
whether daubed upon a fresco or
wrought curiously in fine metal.
For the question, often put and by
many persons, as to whether the artists
of the first century were capable of
painting a portrait of Christ there
seems to be such an overwhelming
cloud of affirmative answers that one
hardly knows where to begin in the
enumeration of them. As a matter of
fact, the' era of. Christ was an era of
no mean artistic production. Polydorus
sculptured his celebrated Laoeoon at
Cue very time that the apostles were
preaching in the Catacombs. Indeed.
Woman art never reached a higher point
than during the first centuries. And in
one direction particularly was Roman
art â¢ pre-eminently fineâ was in
portraiture.-
The picture of the Roman youth to

likeness of Christ. '
Likeness, be it understood, is some
thing deeper than a . merc "arrangement

express it. Likeness is a trick of ex-

You all fcscfw her and know what

When you call at her home as call
you must every seventh blue moon,
untwists herself from a great arm
chair and advances quite two inches to
meet you with one hand lazily extend
ed and the other holding the latest
magazine or novel of the day. She
smiles a sort of half-hearted smile that
pulls the "corners of her mouth a trifle
and that is intended to convey the idea
that fine. is pleased to see you. Maybe
she even goes so far as to say so, but
her ordinary form of greeting is "How
are you: I'm nearly dead."
And she certainly conveys as much
by .. her every movement. She . sinks
into a miserable little- huddle in the
most comfortable chair the room af

bolsters up her head to keep it from
falling off her shoulders. Her hands
are folded listlessly in her lap. and
with i he exception of an aimless move
now and then, she sits like an animated
lump of lead Just as long as you in
flict yourself by remaining in her pres
ence.
Now and then her duties as a hostess
seem, to ; rouse, her a bit and she talks
in a low, monotonous voice that sounds
for the. world, and ill as though she
Had just 'returned from a wake and -was
too hopelessly gleepy to :. know any

to brew you a cup of tea, "but you're*
scared out of your seven senses when
she comes within two feet of you for
fear- she will fall over some trifle in
her abstraction and land cup, tea and
all into the lap of your very best call

Oh, she's such a pleasure, is this list

you say black is black, and she agrees

vastly different, but as a rule she sits
hopelessly down and waits dreamily

You simply cannot drive or coax her

Of course, the girl who is listless and

the tired body for rest will yield more
lasting results in the way of good than
an extra hour in bed in a disheveled
state. First brush the hair thorouehly
to - dislodge ; dust and dandruff, then
massage the scalp for. five or ten min
utes with the finger tips. Brush the
hair again gently,, braid It rather
loosely . and pin up out . of the way
while bathing, the face and neck. For
this : bath use plenty of warm water
and a bland soap, finishing with a
cool ; rinse and an application of cold
cream if the skin seems dry or rough.
To relieve the tired feet indulge in a â 
warm foot .bath: there is nothing equal
to it to soothe the tired nerves, espe
cially . if : it be accompanied by eentle
i friction. The hands demand special
consideration. Trim the nails neatly
and .if: the skin is rough or stained,
lemon juice will : remove the stains and
tend to whiten the akin. Rinse the
juice off and anoint the hands with
,a , good cold : cream. :Of '* course the â¢
dainty woman will not â¢ neelect J;to",
brush her teeth the last 'thing before
retiring. The Juice of a sweet oransre
will be : refreshing and act' as t , a . cor
rective if one is inclined to biliousness,
but do not drink hot chocolate nor eat ;
: solid foods just before retiring. If one
wishes the body may receive. a thor
ough : soap . and water bath, . but this
should not ,be taken at . night more
frequently than twiele a week as a rule.
> THE 1 OBNOXIOUS . CROWS FEET
CM. H. J.).â When crow's feet and the
kindred wrinkles about the eyelids
-* appear, * lose ; no; time *in giving them
attention in the \ form of massage, to
â  strengthen and exercise the weak mus
cles, and 'at reliable cream to ; facilitate -
! the building up of the wasting tissues.
, The treatment '^ used s In-/ eradicating
. these [ lines will j also â  prove very ' bene
l ficial to the eyesight, strengthening, as
they will, ; the surrounding muscles and
the nerves : of I the eyes. Great care
must be used lin giving the : massage,
as haphazard methods will do more
I harm s than good. â â - After bathing ; the
face thoroughly * rub .-* cocoa butter or
; any | reliable skin 5 food freely f into the '
'â  deep wrinkles around the - eyes. Begin
at the inner corner of the eye in a
circular motion outward to : the temple.
The pressure ; should -be light -- : and â¢ the
movement \ rather .i slow or it may irri-
i tate the' eyelid. Contiue for five min
utes, ; repeating about { twenty times.
; Close the eyes, then place the tips of
' two 1 fingers k again ;at r the inner;; corner "
-,' or "> the eye and draw the * fingers very
: lightly over A" the >- eyeball ,*. outward .to
\ the temple ; \ this will greatly strengthen ,
. a drooping upper lid. c Repeat this be v -
I eral times with three fingers go that
the third will come below the ey i. To
eradicate the crow's feet at the corner
; of t the > eyes, cover \ the ; finger tips with
â  ; plenty of .the cream and perform a eir
' cular r movement, being particular*- to
;always rub across the deep lines': > this
mbvementvis also invaluable in 'filling
. out depressed temples. The skin must
be Ke/ld firm while rubbing in the cream
around 'the eye?. Place the -fingers of
the*' left hand above and below the
crow's feet,' pressing the fingers apart.
thus*}>ulllng\ the skin smooth, and rub
;in -with the right hand, reversing this '
order '.when doing the right, eye. /The
treatment should be given just before
retiring. and be persevered in. for many
\yeeks. *j( Especially is perseverance
necessary if the lines are of long stand
ing-. Be persistent and the reward will

MODERN SOCIAL USAGES "(An
na L.). â is never good form 'to speak
flippantly of established social customs,
for. it stamps a person as lacking In
goad breeding. Further, punctilious
people are apt to observe such; ; bad
form and not likely to [ forgive your
flippancy. "When a person enters so
ciety she must expect to. pejf arm .faith
fully the manifold duties, making: due
apologies for unavoidable omissions
.when, necessary. If she *isi not willing:
to follow such lines, sooner or later
; .wUl>jpay-the price in seeing her erst
while friends drift away. Punctuality
and attention to details -compose, the oil
which keeps social wheels moving
without 'friction. Never neglect pre
sent 1 your card when making a first
call. " Servants are apt â¢to confuse
names sadly and it is very awkward
for the hostess to be compelled to ask
the' name of her caller. : - Always have
your street and house ntrmber clearly
engraved on the lower right hand cor
ner of your visiting card and the '.'days
at home" on the lower left-hand" cor
ner of the card. It is not necessary to
leave your card each time. you call. on
intimate friends, although It is always
courteous to do so. When " fruit and
flowers are sent by frienda Ito a person
who is ill. a member of the family
should acknowledge the . gifts. When
the recipient is recovered a polite note
of thanks,, should be sent to- each- per
son who was kindly attentive. An-in
vitation to luncheon or dinner demands
an immediate reply in the i negative or
affirmative. This is imperative â  and .Is
due to the hostess so that she may
know how to order the covers. â * Never
accept an invitation In the hope that
you may get there at the eleventh
â¢hour. Late arrivals or ..vacant .dmirs
at a feast are hardly conducive? to' the
serenity of a hostess. â Â£/. - . .. ; . ,
TO MAKE A SHIRT WAIST (Elea
nor).âft is comparatively easy to
learn to make a shirt waist If you will
begin right. To obtain correct bust
measure is the first step. Pass a tape
around the body, about three inches
below the armpits, over -^c - shoulder
blades and the fullest part of â¢ tha
bust. Draw the tape up moderately
tight and make a note, of the /exact
measurement. Should your measure
ment be, for example, 3-1% v inches, se
lect a 34- inch bust pattern, as It can
readily be let out to make up the slight
difference, while if the next standard
* size, 36, was selected. it would be too
large in many parts for a beginner to
manipulate. Select a paper pattern of
reliable manufacture to . correspond
with the bust measure. ; A per:
plain shirt waist " closed â . with , a center
box piait with bishop '/_ sleeves : com
pleted by a straight band . cuff, with
slight fullness 'gathered; in. the ' fronts
, at the neckband is very simple to make
but difficult enough for the novice to
begin with. Read the directions for
making and cutting which accompany
the pattern and especially notica
whether seam * allowance ' is made on
the pattern and how much. > The best
material to experiment- with is* firm
striped gingham. I mention this par
ticularly, because the > fabric has
body .; enough *to prevent? pulling out at
the seams or stretching, acrid the stripes
are very helpful in guiding a beginner
in cutting accurately with the correct
thread" of the fabric, a very. important
part* of the work. Briefly, the. correct .
method of cutting is always to place
the front .edge of the front ;o* waist
pattern next to the selvage; length
wise of the^goods, the back edge of
back and yoke, if any, to a lensrthwlse
fold; the sleeves with line of lengthwise

CRACOW. Poland. April "2. â Affairs j
In Poland are In a desperate state of
unrest an<i uncertainty, and fust how
had they are or may become later no
body knows. In Warsaw anything
may happen The recent attempt to
dynamite Baron Nolken, the Warsaw
Chief of Police, struck terror to the
hearts of the authorities, who regard
it as only the first step in the direc
tion of riots, compared with which the
sanguinary outbreaks of last Janu
ary were harmless demonstrations.
Their fears are well grounded, for
the leaders of th* Polish Socialistic
Revolutionary party, who organized
the recent strikes, have decided on
drastic- methods. A special commit
tee â¢tins- in Warsaw has marked the
names of offi'ials who are to be as
sassinated. Dynamite bombs and
pistols will be the chief weapons used.
In the last few' months 120.000 revolvers
of English manufacture have been
smuggled into Poland.
ThÂ« trouble is. likely to . begin in
Warsaw on May 1. or possibly May 3.
The /first date is T>abor day in Rus-'
sian Poland; the second has a patri
otic and political significance as bein^
the anniversary of the day. on which
th's country received its first great
constitutionâ May 3, 1791. These two
days always are marked by more or
less serin-:*? demonstrations in War
saw, and it will b*> next door to a
miracle if they _ pass . Ida year with
out Incidents calculated .to precipitate
a reign of terror.
The scent of these demonstrations
probably will be either Ujazdowska
street, '. where, stands the famous
Church of Ft Alexander, or the neigh
borhood of Adam Mickiewicz's statue.
UJasdowska* street attracts crowds of
reople en the national anniversary be
cause it leads to the Warsaw Botanical
Gardens, which contain the ruins of
an unfinished < hapel planned by Stan
islaus Augustus, last King of Poland.
M a memorial of the constitution. On
May 3. too, gather students in great
force about the statue to Mickiewicz,
vho wag Poland's greatest poet, for
the purposeof decorating: it with flow
er*; and this ceremony, which begins
k> peacefully, frequently ends in blood
shed.
UKJWKAL WSSATISI \< TION.
There now have been strikes in all
the large centers and towns of Rus
sian Poland and some of thesÂ» strikes
â¢are still going on. In the country the
peasants are everywhere' agitating for
improved conditions of life, and, as
they number nearly four-fifths of the
whole population of Russian Poland,
their movement is exciting the liveliest
apprehension of the authorities. Dis
order prevails throughout Poland in
every branch of trade and industry
and the business life of the country is
almost at a standstill. ..;''
This unfortunate state of affairs is
due to various causes. Among them
are bad harvests, low wages, long
nours of labor, oppression from petty
officials, the war in the Far East, and,
Ust but not least, the fears of fur
tier mobilization. But .the bloody
r ots and conflicts between the mili
**>* and the people, which occurred in
* reav at the end of last January,
-/-â 'â¢â  . â  . .

were precipitated by the similar hap
penings in St. Petersburg.
The Warsaw disturbances, which
mark the beginning of the troubles in
Polan I, constitute a lasting and burn
ing disgrace to the Russian authori
ties, civil and military alike. They
were begun by irresponsible school
boys and continued by the "Hooligan "
element of the city. The police could
have nipped them in the bud had they
wished to do so, but purposely desisted
and the consequence was a three days'
insurrection, such as Warsaw had not
experienced since the revolution of
1863.
PEOPLE PUT TO SWORD.
A general strike had broken out in
Wtntw, but the utmost quiet and or
der prevailed. The strikers maintained
a perfectly correct altitude, seeking
only by peaceable persuasion to get the
shopkeepers to close their businesses
in sympathy with the strike. There
was no breach of the peace until one
morning a crowd of schoolboys started
in to break street lamps in a thor
oughly systematic fashion. The police
only looked on with amused indiffer
ence and the boys had a beautiful
time. Later, however, the "Hooligans "
and criminal* of the city, some 5000
in number, began to emerge from their
haun'.s and started in to pillage and
plunder shops and stores and dwell
ings. Even then the police refrained
from interference until the affair as
sumed alarming dimensions.
Then the military was summoned in
hot haste and infantry, artillery and
the brutal Cossacks started in with
fierce eagerness to clear the streets
and put down the rioting. They spared
neither man, woman nor child. The
crowds, which included many quiet
and inoffensive citizens attracted only
by curiosity, were ruthlessly shot
down or sabered by the cavalry. Scirres
of dead and dying persons were carried
off to the police stations and the wards
SAX FRANCISCO. SUNDAY, APRIL 23, 1905.
of the hospitals w*Â»re crowded with the
wounded. Many hundreds of men and
women were arrested.
In two days order was restored,
when the authorities committed a crime
which it will be long before the citi
zens of Warsaw forget . or forgive.
They let loose upon the city a regi
ment of hussars, picked men, belong
ing to the bodyguard of the Czar.
Uncontrolled by officers or sub
officers, these mounted ruffians swept
through the streets of the city, shoot
ing, slashing, cutting, riding down
everybody they met. Nobody was safe
from their violence. Innocent passers
by and little children who sought ref
use in shops and doorways fell before
their swords. Revolting tales are cur
rent of their bloody deeds. A credible
witness who visited two hospitals, de
clared that it was pitiable to see the
number of young children brought into
the wards mutilated by the sabers of
these hussars. When at last these
uniformed butchers had been with
drawn the authorities were able to
take stock of the situation.
VICTIMS NUMBER HUNDREDS.
The official list of dead contained
nearly 400 names, while the corpses of
another hundred victims were awaiting
identification in the hospital and ceme
tery morgue*. As for 'the wounded,
their number could not be ascertained,
and will never be known, as very many
of them were taken by friends lo their
own homes. The citadel and district
police stations were crowded with
prisoners, many of them wounded.
Nearly all of them, even the wounded,
were cruelly beaten in the prisons by
the infuriated police and soldiers.
Dark talÂ»s arc told of men and wo
men being flogged to death and their
bodies buried within the precincts of
the jails. Many families in Warsaw
are mourning the disappearance of
beloved husbands, fathers, sons or
brothers during the terrible days of
January.
A Rieat gpneraJ strike followed this
l-piKii of terror. Trade after trade and
industry after industry was drawn
into the movement. One day the
shoemakers struck, and on the next
the bank clerks, domestic servants
and policemen, railway men and tram
way drivers and conductors, gasmen
and iron molders, bookkeepers and
street sweepers, all joined the army of
strikers. Some strikes lasted only a
few minutes, others continued for
weeks. Now nearly all are over, but
they have been settled upon a false
basis and peace cannot last long. The
employers gave in all along the line
and granted the strikers higher wages,
shorter hours and almost every other
concession they demanded. The rail
way employes get a nine hour day and
the bank clerks are to have a months
holiday every year. No demand seem
ed too unreasonable to be granted.
HOSTILE PEASANTRY.
But although from the labor stand
point the cities and towns are quieter,
the country districts are seething with
troubles. In every direction the peas
ants are striking. Higher wages,
shorter hours, pasture and forest
rights and the use of the Polish lan
guage instead of the Russian in vil
lage affairs- these are among tho va
ried demands of the seven million
peasants in Poland. Hitherto they
have kept quiet, much to the relief of
the authorities. But socialist agita
tors have been busy and their efforts
have met with success.
Of all the peasants 1 demands, the
most important relates to the language
question. The peasants have discov
ered thnt there Ip nothing in the law
against the use of Polish in local Gov
ernment affairs, and they bitterly re
sent the action of the petty Russian
officials in forcing their language upon

them to the exclusion of the peasants'
mother tongue.
Only the other day a peasant was
waiting his turn in a village postof
flce, and hearing that the official at
the window was unable to give a cus
tomer change, volunteered to lend him
some small coins. The official whom he
was trying to oblige promptly fined
him three roubles ($1 50) for speaking
Polish in a Government office. The
peasant felt none the lees aggrieved
when he remembered that the afore
said fine would go into the pocket of
the official. Such an incident Is by no
means uncommon and does not tend to
promote pleasant relations between the
peasants and the Russian local official
world.
The Polish peasants and working
men, comprising over 9,000,000 persons
in a total population of 10.000.000 in
Russian Poland, have nothing against
the Russian Government as a Gov
ernment. In fact they prefer it to be
ing subjected to the tyrannical extor
tions of the old Polish aristocracy, and
they would Infinitely rather live under
the yoke of the Czar than run any risk
of coming under the Germans, whom
they hate with a deadly hatred. Seri
ous riots there may be among the
peasants before the present troubles
are ended, but no intelligent person
here believes for an instant that there
will be any national rising, organized
or otherwise, againÃt the sovereignty
of Russia.

AMERICAN DUCHESS
AIDS STRIKERS.
Gives Coin to Mill Girls
Sleep Cure Evolved for Tired
Society Women Abroad.
Special Cable to The Call.
LONDON. April 23.â When the Duch-
ess of Roxburghe was returning to her
Scottish home recently she heard that
a number of mill girls were on strike
at Paisley. Having ascertained that
the girls were protesting against a
proposed reduction of wages, she
broke h?r journey at Glasgow and
went on to Paisley, where she person
ally investigated the conditions under
which the girls live. Her identity was
kept a profound secret at the time,
only one or two Paisley women, who
take an interest in mill girls, knowing
who the refined and elegantly dressed
stranger was. The Duchess pointed
out that it was not her intention to In
terfere in any agitation that affected
employer and employes. She merely
came to find out what girls earned and
how they lived.
Having discovered that many of
them were suffering from thp effects of
the dispute, she left a substantial sum
of money to relieve their immediate
necessities and gave instructions that
she was to be kept informed from day
to day of the progress of the trouble
between the girls and their employers.
She made it a stipulation that the as
sistance which she was then giving
was not to be made a pretext on the
part of the girl's for a continuance of
the strike. The trouble is now at an
end, but the Scottish mill girls have
found out that they have a friend in
the Duchess.
Gives up London house.
Although Mrs. Adair has decided to
give up her house in Curzon street, it
is not her intention to desert London
altogether. She wjll appear occasion
ally at social functions and devote to
charity a reasonable share of her time.
For a number of years this popular
American woman has practically
taken the lea-1 amonf society dames
in all undertakings that have for their
object the alleviation of the sufferings
of the poor and afflicted in London,
and now she finds that the drain on
her purse has been so great that siÂ»s iÂ»
cannot afford to occupy that position
any longer.
â  During the .time she spends in Lon
don ; she *is besieged %by ' beggars â¢* and
begging j letters. She : relieves i such of
the : former as she deems worthy of her
assistance. f ,* The ; begging ; letters she
always hands over to the Charity Or
"ganizatiorT Society, which makes care
ful inquiry into â¢ every . case and reports
accordingly ; to Mrs. ; Adair. "'.7- Many .. of
these cases"; become "the subject of Po
lice Court* prosecutions " afterward, * be
cause it is discovered that a ivie pro
portion of the applicants foi charity
are confirmed frauds.
It is Mrs. Aciair's intention to spend
all the time she can spare during thÂ«
summer months at her charming man
sion among th? picturesque scenery of
Donegal, in Ireland. There she mean 3
to do the most of her entertaining, and
there, too, she will dispense the most
of her charity du rinse the present year.
Whatever entertaining she does in
London will be at one or other of the
fashionable hotels.
tTRIBITE TO LADY ORFORD.
Before Lady Orford left Mannington
Hall for V/olterton Hall, where Â»he and
the Earl will henceforth reside, there
occurred a striking tribute to her pop
ularity. A delegation representing the
two hundred odd tenants of the estate
waited upÂ«>n her and implored her to
remain among them. Some mi the old
men and women added tears to their
entreaties. If they could only bring
her around they felt sure Lord Orford
would yield to her persuasions. But
?? it had taken two years and the ex
penditure of a lot of money to fix up
VVolterton Hall tor their occupancy, the
abandonment of the project was out â¢>Â£
the question.
Sh^- consoled the sorrowing folk by
telline thÂ°m rhat sh* 3 was only mov
ing to another part of the county of
Norfolk, and that if any of them Â»vÂ»r
had anythins: to complain of they
could still see her at any time, and that
she would continue to take the same
personal interest in th<Â»jr welfare as
before. With such assurances they had
to be sat is tied.
Her democratic American spirit, her
freedom from anything like autajfratic
airs and her accessibility at all times
have greatly endeared her to the
humble folk round about Manntngton
Hall, and they \\l!l sorely miss h*r
presence, even if things continue to
run smoothly with them.
MAY SLEEP FOR A MONTH.
What the giddy folk of th* smart set
are always yearning after is something
that will enable them to have no end
of a good time without being tired out
by it.
Now, from a Swedish physician. Dr.
Otto Wetterstrand, has come a mes
sage which is full of comfort and joy
for the jaded and despairing devotees
of Mayfair. He has discovered a meth
od by which sleep may be prolonged
for three or even four weeks and has
proved the marvellous recuperative
benefits of such treatment on some
thing like 3000 persons. The run down
society women reclines in an easy
chair: she sees others doing the same,
she listens, as they do, to a quiet, for
cible exposition of the cure from the
doctor, who afterward speaks to her in
a subdued undertone, "suggesting " thÂ«
benefit her particular malady will re
ceive. After a few days of such pre
liminary treatment, the patient goes
willingiy to bed and to sleep, roused
occasionally to a half conscious state
to eat.
The deeper the ?Â«lumher the quicker
the cure, and unlike that produced by
drugs it is as invigorating as natural
sleep and allows nature an equal
chance of restoring "rsanio and func
tional disorders.

holding the largest meeting and class
initiation ever held in the history of
that organization. Initiating a class of
thirty, which equals, if it does not sur

building was attended by more than
400 persons, who each had "a barrelful
of laugh." Mrs. Eola M. Cyrus was the
school mistress and the trouble she
had with Henry W. Osthoff, as the star
pupil, was enough to drive any ordi
nary teacher to the madhouse. Danc
ing followed the school session. Loyal
Lodge will have an open meeting April
24, which will be complimentary, and
on May 11 it will have a theater party.
During the second week in April a

At a recent meeting of Bay City
Lodge, I. O. O. F., there was a visit to
it by Grand Master J. W. Linscott and
many members of the order. A very
pleasant evening was spent. A feature,
however, was the presentation by
Treasurer Albert Steiner, on behalf of
the lodge, a costly gold watch to

vices he has rendered to it in the past.
An excellent banquet followed the clos

manner in which he discharged the du
ties of his important office and regret
has been expressed that he could not be
retained for another term.

Blanche
Partington
There is afloat just now a deal of
nonsense concerning the substitutions
in the casts of some of the recent New
York productions seen here. Lightly,
the argumentative process employed is
known a? "dragging a red herring
across the trail." It is true that the
eaid productions have been untruth- i
fully and quite superfluously adver
tised as identical with the original
ones. It is further true that we have
been long suffering in the matter of
inferior productions foisted upon us
with such cheerful persistence. And
here is the real point at issue. What
concerns the public is not that it shall
get a production at every point identi
cal with the original one. What does
concern the public is simply that it
shall get a good one.
The mistake is in supposing that
'"original cast" is a synonymous term
for the best cast. There are arguments
in favor of the supposition: such argu- |
ments as that for the original produc
tion the greatest possible care in the
choice of sympathetic actors will be
made. But such choice is not infalli
. ble. Take the first Beekmesser of our
acquaintance, the very good . one of
David Bisphaxn. Before last week's
presentment of "Die Melsterslnger"
regrets were loud In the land for Mr.
Bispham's- absence. But who now re
members it? In face of the classic por
trait of the old meistersinger presented
hy Mr. Goritz. Mr. Bispham's Beck
messer sinks almost to the level of
farce. And such things are constantly
occurring. Not thai the cast is not
the original one but that it is an in
ferior one is where grievance begins.
There are cases where one is out for
a personality, where substitution is an
offense. I want my Mrs. Fiske when
I go to see a "Leah Kleschna," and
should certainly say things if They
tried to palm off a May Irwin on m*.
But such substitutions are rarely
made They are made occasionally.
I-os Angeles was the scene of one just
lately. It was a particularly wicked
one in that the substituting actor was
quite as good as the original and se
duced the critics not only into praise
of his work, but into the discovers* of
family traits that only the other mv
could* have honestly come by. Lionel
.more was the absentee, Tolly
Marshall the brilliant offender. The
offence in this case has been frequent.
While Mr. Barrymore lay ill for many j
Â«cÂ«k? the audiences of The Other i
Girl", put up with entire satisfaction â¢
with the clever Mr. Marshall. Their j
i "mment upon the remarkable influ
ences of heredity must have amused
both actors. Mr. Marshall did play i
the part first- Apparently, also, he !
pla>ed it exactly as well as Mr. Barry- [
moreâone cannot Imagine Kid Garvy
better played than by Hill win > anil
in the East, where the reputations of
the two actors are pretty much on . a
par. the affair seems to have been
taken entirely a* a joke.
"The Other Girl" is one of the afore
mentioned productions. Though we
did have Miss Ethel's brother in thÂ«
cast there were substitutions made.
Because of this the management has
been accused of imposition upon the
public and In fact was technically
guilty. But what is the truth of the
case? Drina de Wolfe, who was the
original ingenue. Miss Fulton, has not
been here: but careful inquiry fails to
discover any particular reason for Miss
de Wolfe'6 importation save a pretty
f^ce and a genius for wearing gowns.
Miss Doris Keane, who took her place,
is on the contrary an actress of notable
charm, pretty, winsome, accomplished
and altogether one of the most en
gaging ingenues seen here for long
daye But. ; nevertheless, had Miss
Drina de Wolfe not been otherwise en
raged, we should have had the hap- i
piness of seeing her pretty face and her
cleverly worn gowns during the en
gagement.
There can again be no two opinions
that the part of the* minister was well !
played by Richard Bennett. It was as
well played as even Frank Worthing,
who was the original Dr. Bradbury,
TRIALS OF PORTRAIT PAINTERS
That story of Chartran's about his
scissoring the portrait of a patron be
cause the husband of the lady debated
the truth of the likeness, has been the
topic of much studio gossip here
abouts.
Should or should not a portrait of a
woman be brutally true, or should
the artist "Improvise" as his sense
suggests?
Now, here's a pretty situation â the
woman, of course, desires to see her
self upon canvas ' idealizedâ of this
there is no question! It's a matter of
sex-individuality, and there is no evi
dence at hand of even the exception
that proves the rule.
Then, there's the artistâ he who
abbore the ugly, the commonplace,
and adores the beautiful, the unusual.
Naturally, he seeks out the good points
of his patron â her coloring, her grace,
her soul â she have one â and pro
reeds to emphasize these. And he
seeks to put her on canvas as he would
like her to â herself; but herself as
seen through the lens of the lover, for
the lover sees naught but the beautiful
In the queen of his heart.
Then comes the husband â he who
->ays for the portraitâ he who
â¢ees not with the f eyes of the lover.
Tinny unveils the mysticism of
*ioration, and the husband, lest he
P- a poet or a self-hypnotist, knows
<> : ly too well that the woman he has
could â  have played it. Miss Grace
Henderson, too, as Mrs. Waterman,
was the altogether charming woman
of- society.: She, was. it Is, not irrele
vant to mention, by 'steen dollars a
week more expensive than the original
exponent of the part. Nor could Mag
gie Fielding as the cook lady, famous
in such roles as Miss Henderson in
hers, have been bettered. Francis
Byrne, -again, was a classic reporter,
and Ella Ray. Wallace Eddinger and
"Mr. Fulton of Philadelphia"â he was
so Philadelphian I cannot remember
his other name â were all wholly satis
fying. Miss Adelaide Prince, the Miss
Kittredge of the cast, was its one dis
aster. â¢ -
The New York casts are not given to
â bowing any higher average than this,
nor. again, very pertinently, is the New
York cast a stationary affair,
changes are constantly being made
even in the sacred "original cast. "
Takr "The Earl of Pawtucket," for ex
amnle. During the play's New York
ru,n Mr. D'Orsay made love to no fewer
than five Harriets. (Are we to de
mand the whole five, or which of
'em?) It wap s<> with "The Other
Girl." though not to the same ex
tent. It is almost necessarily po
with any play that enjoys a long run.
Only, therefore, in the matter of an
untruthful label. "Original cast," can
one find the management here guilty
of imposition.
The matter is again to the fore this
week with the production of "The Red
Feather" at the Columbia. I know
nothing of the New York cast of "Red
Feather," but that Thomas Q. Sea
brooke was of it. They like Mr. Sea
brooke in New York: so do we â like
him in New York. Certainly the com
edian who substituted is an agreeable
substitute to us. Nor could one readily
wedded is not an angel, nor does she
look like one.
Therefore if her nose be uptilted. b,e
â wants it that way in her portrait, and
without reduction. If she be scant of
hair, he wants her to be honest with
posterity and own up to it in her pic
ture. If* her mouth be big enough to
whisper into her ear he wants it just
that way â no rosebud embellishments
for him. I veritably believe if she had
a wart on her nosetip. he would want
it faithfully produced in the portrait.
â¢'These husbands." say the artists,
"are the limit for wanting true like
nesses' " â the appalllngest thing in the
world to a woman. Now, where's the
poor artist "at"? â between his ideal
ism and the vanity of the woman on
one hand and the brutal frankness of
the husband on the other â he who
pays the bill?
Now this wan exactly the position of
f'hariran. He painted the woman as
he saw her â or to be more explicit, as
he wanted to see her. He emphasized
the glory of her midnight eyes, he
deepened the tone of her ripe lips, he
pjve to her ivory skin the tint of the
tea rose â she was ravishingly lovely
and lovable â and the woman smiled
at the "embellishments" and approved.
Not so with her husband, who squinted
at and scrutinized the splendid crea
ture and then condemned 1t â he
wanted a picture of his wife â and that
wasn't his wife as he saw her. Re

dians than those in charge of the
scant fun of "Red Feather. ' They in

business ever seen here and succeed in
carrying the thing from first to last
with a laugh. This has to be seen to be
believed, for what the librettist does not

Louis Casavant. with his big smile and
big bass: the pocket jester Myron Da

W. J. McCarthy â as funny in the
Dutch fashion as they make them.
All of these have- â I believe â com
mitted the sin of not being or
iginally cast. I do not imagine, how
ever, that any seeing them will
find themselves imposed upon, and
they can be safely advised thereto.

Miss Calhoun herself i.s a Califor

is particularly pleasing as the young
Indian maid, girlish, spirited and alto
gether attractive. She looks the part
charmingly, with her long, shining
braids of black hair and olive skin.

It is an engagement that will be looked
forward to with eager eyes by every
class of playgoer. The combination is
irresistible. Miss Marlowe is one of the
most cultured and charming or Shakes

many roles. Mr. Sothern is himself fa

worshiper of Shakespeare. Both have
long de?irtd to return to the Shakes

Frohman most delightfully to ioin

charm than in former days.

I cannot resist quoting the follawing,
and commend it humbly to the aten
tion of Dr. A. WllhelmJ and the "ha
bitual admirers" of Eugen d' Albert.
It Is from the pen of no less a person
age than thÂ« critic of the New York
Sun. and concerns a recent recital of
the much-discussed pianist at Car
negie Hall.
Eugen d'Albert. pianist, gave a re
cital last night at Carnegie Hail. The
programme consisted entirely of com
positions by Beethoven. They were
the thirty-two variations in C minor.
sonata in E flat, opus 31; No. 3. r
opus 51; No. .', Rondo a Caprir
opus 12S; sonata in A flat, opus lift.
and sonata in C minor, opus 111. It
had been actively disseminated that
Mr. d" Albert was the greatest â if not
the only livingâ exponent of the piano
music of Beethoven, and naturally it
was regarded as a moral certainty that
th* entrance to the hall would be
mobbed by excited throngs of music
lovers, teachers and students, out to
acquire the true gospel.
"But it was a poor night for mobs.
The audience was of tolerable sixe ami
of complacent temper. It failed to re
spond even to the determined and al
most desperate efforts of a few habit
ual admirers â¢â¢{ Mr. d'Albert to con
jure up a phantasm of enthusiasm.
It may be true that Mr. d'Albert is
the greatest living exponent of
Heeth'jven, but if he is then this is a
mighty poor era for Beethoven. That
this pianist la paved with good inten
tions toward the music of the great
est sonata writer is apparent through
a thick fog of obscuring mannerisms
in style.
"There are splendid moments in his
interpretations, but they are the mo
ments when it is impossible for him *a
employ the loud 1 pedal or to play at
his top speed. For instance, his read
ing of the recitative passage at the be
ginning of the last movement of opus
111 was superb. Again, his treatment
of the introductory trills before the
final variations ;n the opus 111 was that
of a great master.
"But there were too many passages
played in a manner unworthy
artist of such reputation. All rapid
passages were pitilessly blur-ed and
rattled of at a lightning gait. which
precluded any possibility of clarity of
rhythm or of color. They were si
waves jf inchoate sounds.
'"Balance between right and left
hands seems seldom to be in Mr. d'.-M
bert's mind, and his bass is usually
hard and aggressive. In the treble, too.
he employs a great deal of unnecessary
finger power and frequently produces
a hard and forced tone. The plain
truth is that he does not play the
piano affectionately, but with a sug
gestion of suppressed hostility to the
instrument. â¢ - SHRBBMH
;"It may be that he loves Beethoven,
but ..whom he loveth he chasteneth.
Certainly there wai no single number
in his recital last night which was per
formed in a manner lit to serve as a
model. for those pianists who are to
come after him." . " *

BEHOLD THE EASTER BRIDE
Every Easter brings us brides, just
as it brings us Bermuda lilies and new
bonnetsâ all of which are equally lovely
and wholly indispensable to a progres
sive people; the brides being rather
less dispensable, perhaps, than the
lilies and â noâ cannot bring my
self to eliminate the in^ortance of the
bornet. I cannot.
What would an Easter be without
one!
One might as well ask children to
have an Easter without, colored eggs.
But as for the propensity of maids
to evolve themselves at Eastertide into
brides most mystic and exquisite
entity that womanhood knowsâ that is
a custom in unity with the laws of na
ture, of the church and of society.
To begin with, Easter always comes
to us when the hills are clothed in the
garments of spring; the fields and hill
sides are ablaze with the "cup of gold"
and the luxuriant lupine, and the warm
earth is throbbing with the unrest of
growth.
Above fur windows the sparrows are
nesting, and "love, love, love," is
chirped in unceasing cadenzas â -s
mating time for the little birdies.
Then why not for us? !-'"
And as for the religious side of
it, â¢ here is in the story of the
day a beautiful promise of hap
piness, in the ascent into the world
of soul-duality. There seems to be
something prophetic in the dayâ
beautiful theory that sometimes does
make good. But why destroy an Illu
sion?
As to the social reasons for the prop
agation of the Easter bride, they are
many Aftei the winter, with its sweet
propinquities, many a chap has awak- j
er.ed to find himself in tune with na- ;
ture, and aflame with love. Then
come the sweet, unbusy hours of Lent,
when bridge and other seductive and
sanctifying tete-a-tetes bring the
thing to a kiss and a climax.
Papa is asked, says "yes" â bless him!
âwhich means that he will stand pat
for a trousseau.
And the dressmaker gets busy next
dayâ that she may be through "by
Easter."
What sort of a wedding do you sup
pose could happen without the services i
of a dressmaker?
1 have heard or weddings without
ministers, but never without the fem
inine factotum. Have you? j
But, blessings on our Easter brides!
Hay their ascent Into the realm of soul
duality be more than an ecstacy!

The Sequoia Club will be "at home"
on Wednesday night â "at home" at its
own fireside
And there's a bowl of good punch
a-brevdr.g, that all who enter may
drink to its health and prosperity. The
new club's home is on gutter street â
554, near Masonâ where quarters have
been delightfully arranged for its three j
hundred members, a half of whom are
men â tnd mighty nice chaps, too. Need
I designate who constitutes the other
half?
Well, this feature alone distin
guishes the club from its fellows on
this side of the Rockies; and there's a
distinct stipulation that none of the
phases of a matrimonial bureau be en
couraged. Nevertheless, the men and
women have a beautiful time, Just as
God meant they should, without the
ever-present and maddening conscious
ness of sex.
Then the club is likewise individual
in its settings. Its furnishings, its cur-
Jains, its hangings all have been
wrought by the hands of artisan mem
bersâeven the pictures that grace the
walls have been painted by Sequoians.

At last pretty Bernadette Robinson
succumbed to the mad adoration of
those Italians. We all felt that she
would, despite her protestations to the
contrary. Lured by the charm of
Rome and the adulation lavished upon
her by the army officers, the charm
ing San Franciscan was loth to come
home.
Who can blame her, when the
world knows what an adorable lover
the Italian can make at least . he does
on the stage. It seems, however, that
the chap who has won the Titian
haired maid is a capital fellow, a lieu
tenant in the army, and is not of the
impoverished brood of most of his fel
lows; that in spite of .his title he is a
worthy chap. 'â  It is not thought that
Miss Robinson will return before her
marriage, and perhaps never.
Therein is ; the unhappy phase of .an
international marriage â one or the
other must yield up a home. It is be
lieved that Mrs. Robinson and Mrs.
Tallant will remain abroad until Bern
adette weds her Italian soldier.
The California Club's affair at the
Palace promises great things, holding
forth in the maple, marble and the
conservatory rooms and the ballroom.
It is in the latter that the most distinc
tive phase of the affair will hold forth
âthe Egyptian templeâ where all sorts
of amazing and interesting things are
going to happen. This booth will be
in charge of Mrs. J. B. Schroeder
(whose travel in Egypt is standing her
in good stead), Mrs. William Willis,
Mrs. A. W. Scott and Mrs. Laura
Bride Powers. The festival is sched
uled for May 11, 12 and 13, day and
evening, but the Egyptian temple will
confine its attractions to the evenings,
when the men are about.
The men are co necessary to make a

utante of a year â and one of the pret
tiest of many a year â Miss Hawes ap
peared to find but little pleasure in the
feverish round of teas, dances and din
ners. A girl of travel and study, life
seems to hold more for her than the
mere passing of it in a social whirl
hence the choice of a quiet career in the
cozy rectory at Redwood with the man
of her choosing.
The wedding will be an evening af
fair at Grace Church and the dainty
little bride will be served by her cou
sin. Miss Elena Robinson â likewise
dainty maid.
Another Easter bride will be Miss
Mary Turnbull, the stunning young
woman who passed up society to take
up the study of medicine. With a per
severance that follows but few smart
set maids who set out for a career,
Miss Turnbull pursued her course in
the East with a dogged determination
and won her degree with honor.
A lucky chap, this George Murphy,
who has won' her. The wedding takes
place next Wednesday at the bride's
home, Miss Virginia Brastow, Miss
Jane Wilshire and Miss Carolyn White
assisting at the services.
While the Sequoia's formal introduc
tion to its new home does not take
place until Wednesday night, still to
day the rooms will tfe open to a very
pretty affair given by Charles H. Lwn
bard. Miss Annie Frances Briggs,
who is soon to leave for Europe, will
be the guest of special attention.
Mr. Lombard will also welcome with
in the new precincts a few members of
the Margaret Anglin Company and all
members and guests may'have a peep
at the future domicile of Sequoians.
There will be tea and music and plenty
of the pleasant chatter.
Next Saturday, beauty and fashion,
maidenly and matronly, will wend its
way eagerly toward the beautiful home
of Mrs. William Tevis, who is extend
ing her house and garden toward the
cause of the Episcopal Old Ladies'
Home.
This is a very dear charity to all
who love old folkâ and who doesn't?
â and one in which the city has much
pride, every care being thoughtfully
provided for by a most efficient board
of managers. Mrs. John I. Sabin is
president, and to her energy much is
owed.
Entertainment of varied character
will be offered and though the af- ;
fair is designated as a "musical tea"
there will be other attractions. As to
music, however, the Twentieth Century
Musical Club and Hawaiian Orchestra
will contribute a large share. The fol
lowing ladies are patronesses: Mrs.
John I. Sabin, Mrs. C. C. Baker, Mrs.
Philip Caduc, Mrs. Alfred Clarke, Mrs.

MANY APRIL FOOL TALES
Tageblatt Prints Story of Robbery
of American Treasury of
$286,000,000.
BERLIN, April 22.â During the whole
month of April the genial custom pre
vails among German newspaper editors
of springing all kinds of April fool
tales. Even the serious Berliner Tage
blatt came out with a story that a band
of robbers broke into the Washington
treasury, stealing $286,000,000. Another
tale describes a device for spinning pe
destrians from one side of a crowded
thoroughfare to the other by means of
a turning table. c

HEEDS ADVICE
OF ATTORNEY
Mrs. Ooids Kef uses to An
swer Questions as to Abil
ity to Satisfy a Judgment
FAILS TO REPAY LOAN
Judge Troutt to Decide if
Lady; iii Case* Should Be
Found Guilty of Contempt
Mrs. Mathilde Cords, who was before
Justice of the Peace Golden on an or
der of examination yesterday, refused,
on advice of her lawyer,, to answer
certain questions put to her. The or
der was made by Superior Judge
Troutt, who appointed Golden as a
special Commissioner to take evidence
as to the amount of property possessed
by Mrs. Cords to determine her finan
cial ability to satisfy a judgment for
$28,000 obtained against her by Rose
M. Biggs and Addie Clartt Norton as
executrices of the estate of Anne E.
Clark, deceased.
When Mrs. Cord's examination be
gan, she was asked by S. J. Hankins,
attorney for the plaintiffs in the suit,
what her occupation was at the time
she executed certain promissory notes
upon which the judgment was secured.
The object was to ascertain what Mrs.
Cords had done with the money she
borrowed from Mrs. Clark.
"I must decline to answer that ques
tion or any others of a like sort on the
advice of my attorney," said Mrs.
Cords.
Judge Golden directed Mrs. Cords to
answer the question, but she again re
fused, shielding herself behind her at
torney's injunction.
Judge Golden had no power to ad
judge the lady guilty of contempt for
refusing to obey his commands, as he
was simply acting as referee in the
case. He therefore referred the matter
to Judge Troutt for further action. It
is said that sensational revelations are
pri/mised from further inquiry in the
proceedings.
Mrs. Cords is secretary and treasurer
of the Pacific Pine Needle Company,
and it is alleged secured the $28,000
from Mrs. Clark during the latter's
lifetime to develop the venture. After
the judgment was secured the Sheriff
was unable to find any property be
longing to Mrs. Cords.
DOORS OF VILE
RESORTS CLOSED

derloin Arc Put Out for
the First Time in Years
RAID BY THE. POLICE
Police Commissioner 3lc-
Adoo Issues Drastic Orders
to "Clean the Place Up"
NEW YORK, April 22. â The sensa
tional affray in a resort known as
Toby's place about a week ago, in
which one man was killed and two
others severely stabbed, to-toy re-
Bulted in an almost unpresphented
condition in the tenderloin. During
the hours between 1 and 5 o'clock this
morning, the period prescribed in the*
excise law, not a light was burning in
any of the hundreds of places peculiar
to that district. Saloons and Raines'
law hotels, rathskellers and other simi
lar resorts, which for years had not
closed their side doors day or night,
hacj suspended operations completely.
In every front window was a sign con
spicuously displayed announcing that
the place had been closed on account
of Good Friday. Developments of the
past week, however, indicate that the
holy day was taken as an excuse
rather than as a reason by the pro
prietors of these resorts.
The murder in Toby's place was of
such a character as to arouse unusual
public attention. The cause of the af
fair, which has been attended by sev
eral sensational incidents, only served
to throw more publicity on the condi
tions which have prevailed in that
quarter. Finaly Police Commissioner
McAdoo gave his personal attention to
the tenderloin and after a tour of the
district issued drastic orders to have
the place "cleaned up." Last night
was chosen as the time for a general
movement by the police. It seems,
however, that the order was antici
pated by the resort-keepers and others,
for when the police started out there
was little to be done. Scores of places
which usually are filled with men and
women at all hours had suspended
business before midnight.

tion Into the Affairs of
Aetna Trading Company
CHICAGO, April 22.â Vice presidents
and cashiers of four>Chicago national
banks have been aubpenaed by the fed
eral officials working on the "beef
trust" inquiry. The subpenas call'
for the production of the accounts and
records of the Aetna Trading Company
and the S. Oppenheimer & Company
Sausage Casing Company. The Gov
ernment officials have traced from
bank to bank and through the Clear
ing House checks which were number
ed and are said to bear fictitious
names. The latest move is said to be
one of the most important yet made in
the investigation and has caused a stir
among the leading packers who are
suspected af luiving been directly con
nected with thefoperatlons of the Aetna
Trading Company.
It required more than two weeks'
hard work on the part of several of
the officers and National Bank Ex
aminer Starek to trace the checks,
many of which were discovered in
trunks recently seized by Government
detectives. It was a direct result of
the developments regarding the checks
that the subpenas were issded for the
officials of the four banks. The per
sons subpenaed are: Vice President
George M. Reynolds and Cashier I. P.
Bowen of the Continental National
Bank; Vice President Don A. Moulton
and Cashier Frank W. Smith of the
Corn Exchange National Bank: Vice
President W. T. Fenton and Cashier
Robert M. McKinney of the Nationaf
Bank of the Republic; Vice President
Joseph T. Talbert and Assistant Cash
ier Nathaniel Osch of the Commercial
National Bank.
It was found that one of the most
complicated methods of bookkeeping:
had been employed by the Aetna Trad
ing Company officials and those of S.
Oppenheimer & Co. No names appear
on any of the books, It is said, to indi
cate that the persons were in any way
connected with the packing Industry.

WOLLATON HALL
EARNS VERDICT
SDecial Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 20.â There was held
recently an interesting discussion as
to what constituted the finest speci
men of Elizabethan architecture in
England. The decision was practical
ly unanimous in favor of "Wollaton
Hnll, the Nottinghamshire seat of
Lord Middleton. The home of the cele
brated "DukerieÃ," Nottinghamshire is
famed for its many grand and historic
houses; but in beauty of design and
majestic appearance none of them can
challenge comparison with Wollaton
Hall. It was built for Sir Francis Wll
loughby in the latter part of the six
teenth century, and was designed by
John Thorpe, better known as John of
Padua, the greatest architect of his
day. He considered it his crowning
achievement.
On the front of It appears this in
scription in Latin: "See this house of
Francis Willoughby; built with rare
art and left for the WUloughbys. Be
gun in 1580; completed in 1588." Sir
Francis was a son of Henry Willough
by. who married Lady Anne Grey,
daughter of the Marquis of Dorset and
sister to the Duke of Suffolk, whose
child became the 111-fated Queen of
England. Sir Francis inherited a vast
estate at an early age. It was hon
estly and economically managed for
him, and with the money that accumu
lated during his long minority he built
the stately pile to take the place of
the older hall, which had been in ex
istence for centuries. "The dedication
of the place to future Willoughbys,"
says a famous historian, "was based
on a juftt belief in the merits and high
character of that great and good fam
ily, of which the present Lord Middle
ton is the head."
Standing on an eminence about half
a mile from the village, Wollaton
Hall dominates the landscape for miles
around. The feature of the interior
is the magnificent hall, with its "min
ftrels' gallery" and superb pictures by
Rubens and other celebrated artists.
The staircases, both north and south,
have been altered since they were first
erected, but the ceilings above are -in
their original state, displaying the
beautiful allegorical paintings oi
Verrio. It will bÂ» noticed that the
niches in the faca-ie are vacant. They
were intended to hold statuettes, but
the ship which bore them from Italy
was lost at sea.
Lord Middleton is one of the best
housed peers In England. In addition
to Wollaton Hall, he possesses two fine
seats in Yorkshire and has a fourth at
Tamworth. His broad acres number
nearly 100,000 and include some valu
able collieries. He is 80 years old, and
entered into his splendid inheritance
in 1877. Farming, forestry and sport
are his favorite recreations. In his
early days he entered the army, but
retired in 1567, after attaining the rank
of captain. He is married, but has no
children. His heir presumptive is his
brother, the Hon. Godfrey Ernest
Willoughby.
Accused of Embezzlement.
Paul E. Kritch, collector for the !
Welsbach Company, 359 Sutter street, j
was arrested yesterday by Detective j
Wren on two warrants charging him ]
with misdemeanor embezzlement. The t
warrants were sworn to before Police j
Judge Mogan by R. J. Thompson, who !
alleges that Kritch has embezzled al- 'â 
together between $300 and $400. He j
had rtrtlected the money in small j
amounts from customers. j
SENTENCES ARE PASSED
UPOX FOUR PRISONERS
Abe G. Schwartz, Who Stole Â»About
$12,000 from Clarence Grange,
Must Serve Four Year*.
Three prisoners who had pleaded
guilty in Judge Dunne's court were
sentenced yesterday. Abe G. Schwartz,
against whom there were three charges
of grand larceny, was given four years
in San Quentln. A strong plea for
clemency was made by his attorney.
Schwartz was employed as assistant to
Clarence Grange, secretary of the
Phoenix Building and Loan Associa
tion, and in January, 1904, he fled
after stealing about $12,000 that had
been intrusted to him.
William Cummlngs, for passing a
fictitious check for $50 on T. M. Fer
guson on February 10, was sentenced
to serve eighteen months In San Quen
tin.
Frank Kawata, a Japajnese, for as
sault with a deadly weapon, received
a sentence of six months in the County
Jail. On January 19 he stabbed F.
Yanagihara.
In Judge Cook's court Peter Wil
'lems, tried for assault with ai deadly
weapon and convicted of simple as
sault, was sentenced to pay a fine of
$30 or serve fifteen days In the County
Jail. He cut Eugene Masson with a
knife on December 28.

Green Accused of Perjury.
Albert Howell, 841 Howard street,
obtsJned a warrant from Police Judge
Cabanlss yesterday for the arrest of
J. W. Green on a chargre of perjury.
Howell was arrested about two weeks
ago on complaint of Green on a
charge of burglary, but the case was
promptly dismissed by police Judge
Fritz, who suggested to Howell that
he should have Green arrested for
perjury. Howell says that Green owed
him $5 and he thought Green had
him charged with burglary so that he
would not have to pay the money.

THE RIGHT OF CONTRACT.
THE United States Supreme Court has voided the ten-hour law
of New York, as applied to bakers, after it had been affirmed
by the State Court of Appeals. Justice Peckham. who wrote
the decision, finds that the law impairs the right of contract and
is obnoxious to the fourteenth amendment. Justice Harlan, who
ted. characterized the decision as the most important ever
rendered by the court. The fourteenth amendment protects life,
liberty and' property. The courts have decided that the right of
contract is a property right. Justice Peckham decides that the
right of contract pertains also 'o the enjoyment of liberty by the
virtual.
The New York law forbade any employment in bakeries in
BBOBM of ten hour? a day. A baker made a private contract with
an employer by which at the same rate per hour he was to work
in excess of ten hours. The law made this a misdemeanor and the
employer was fined $50. The decision affirms the right of the in
drvidual to support his family or make money by the use of his
special Â«ldll. strength or industry. Any law that forbids this impairs
betty to do that which iÂ« the best for himself and to use his
powers and qualities to the best advantage.
The Â«cope of the decision justifies Justice Harlan's opinion of
its importance, though not in the way meant by him. The accumu
lation of property under our institutions is favored by the pro
tection of all rights that pertain to property, and chief among these
is the right of contract. All economists classify labor as property,
as a commodity that is bought and sold. All commodities are sub
ject to measure. The law fixes the pounds of grain in a bushel,
the amount of land in an acre, the weight of a ton of material, and
the importance of an official legal standard of weights and meas
ures is everywhere and properly recognized.
This decision does not deny the right of the law to measure
labor by the hour and to say how many hours shall constitute a
days labor. A standard day is as useful as a standard bushel or
any other weight or measure. It is for the protection and conven
ience of those who sell and of those who buy labor. But that is
the constitutional limit of the law on that subject. If it go further
and forbid the right of the individual to contract for the delivery
of more labor in one period of twenty-four hours than is fixed by
the legal standard, it abridge* his liberty and impairs his property
right. If the standard day be eight hours and a man. by reason of
trength and ambition, contract to deliver sixteen hours' labor
- period of twenty-four hours, it is his right to do so. To for
bid it would be in a legal sense just the same as the limitation of
the amount of any other property that might be delivered in a given
time. The law fixe= the number of pounds in a bushel, but every
one sees the absurdity of denying the right of the seller to deliver
more than a fixed number of bushels of any property in one period
of twenty-lour hours.
The measure of a day's labor and limitation of the amount de
livered have been strangely confused and taken to mean the same
thing. The time has not come, and will never come, to limit a
man's energies and prescribe the amount of work he may do accord
ing to his strength and for gain. The process of limiting the output
of labor and of limiting it? gains by a common restriction is pro
hibitory upon the betterment of the individual. It leads to an evil
that can be produced in this country only by artificial restrictions,
and that is the confining of men strictly in the position in which
they are horn. The great glory of our institutions is that, properly
administered, they favor the progress of men in life. Under them j
the laborer of to-day may become the employer of to-morrow, the
mecha*nic a foreman, the foreman a superintendent, and the superin
tendent a director in the concern where he began as a wageworker.
In a recent issue of the Colusa Sun mention is made of the pur
chase of a large ranch by a man who landed in the Sacramento j
Valley at the age of 18 without a dollar and began life as a wage-)
worker. Now he owns ranches aggregating 1000 acres and does nor
owe a penny. Of course his property may excite the envy of others,
and there may be some who regard his accumulations as a menace,
but it i^ in evidence that he got it all by thrift and industry and
not by sharp practice and injury of others. He enjoyed the right
vate contract and *old his labor to the best advantage. The
question to be considered is. Would society be better off with that
man still a wageworker. denied by lav. the right to benefit by his
superior skill, strength and industry, than it is with him a land
holder, an independent man and with a well reared family to inherit
the estate won by his enterprise and self-denial?
Any law making it a misdemeanor for an ambitious mail to
exceed a narrow limit in his earnings is an unjust limitation of
liberty, and while society may find peril in too large individual
accumulations, oppressively used, its peril is far greater from the
destruction of such a property right as the right of contract, and
from the resulting permanent classification of the people, keeping
part of them without hope of getting on in the world. We want
eh classification in this country, and in this decision the
Supreme Court has canonized against it.
OUR CLIMATIC ASSET.
WHEN' President Chipman of the State Board of Trade
claimed climate as a California asset he concreted an idea
and stated a fact. It is an asset, a part of the capital of
every citizen of this State, which is not enjoyed by those who live
elsewhere. Every Californian starts with that valuable and inalien
able asset. While we are living under the soft skies, and all green
things are growing in a vernal temperature, the East is blowing its
fingers and fighting frost. A widespread black frost has fallen on
the country from Illinois lo Elorida. Early vegetables and stand
ard fruits have in some places been cut off entirely. Snow fell in
Ohio, and Georgia. Tennessee and Alabama have been involved in
the general calamity, instead of being an asset, climate in those
States i- a liability. The bloom was frozen brittle on apple and
peach trees and even the leaves were blasted.
render that th<- first box of California cherries that reached
the Eastern market sold for $10 a pound. They were worth it as a
curiosity. Before the Eastern farmers and truck gardeners have
planted more beans and potatoes in place of those destroyed by this
frost California farmers will be cutting hay and grain. And before
the Eastern victim? of a climatic liability" see the sprouts of their
second planting the owners of a climatic 'asset in California will be
sending: them early peaches and apricots, to console them in the
rs of their unfortunate situation.
Tourists who spent the winter here and went home at the be
ginning of April are sending back their regrets that they went so
early, and are pledging themselves not to set a foot out of California
be/ore the middle of May. It will be better not to leave at all
when they have come here. An interest in our climatic asset costs
nothing but ihe really low railroad fare. Those who come get more
for less money than is found anywhere else on the planet.

He states: "I have vowed that if ever the time comes when history
shall speak of a German world power or a Hohenzollern world power,
this should not be based upon conquest, but come about through a
mutual striving of nations after common purposes."
A thought that emphasizes this confession of the yonthful idea!?
of the heir to a great power is the recollection that in the first years
of his reign the world fastened upon him the sobriquet of "War
Lord. ?> in expectation that, in hot-headed pride, he would use the
great German prestige, of successful fighting, in a -bellicose and
bullying way. Thus our surprise at his victorious keeping to his
vow of peace is mingled with the admiration of his early ideals of
the mission of a great monarch.
From this bright picture of sustained strength in so fulfilling
his promise to himself and overliving the misjudgment of hi*
premature critics we turn to the contemplation of the weakness of
the peace promising Czar, to whom the world prematurely gave
honor for his success in the establishment of the Hague tribunal,
which seemed like a guarantee that the powers of the world, and
especially Russia, meant to use that international court in all sin
cerity to help civilization toward universal peace. Now, since Nich
olas has so signally failed to practice the virtue he seemed so elo
quently to preach, he appears tenfold more condemnable than if he
had made no such promise to the world and to himself.
INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.
VICTOR EMMANUEL'S proclamation calling upon the world to
unite in forming an International Chamber of Commerce is
tn act of initiative almost as notable as the Czar of Russia's
invitation to the nations to form The Hague tribunal of inter
national arbitration. Perhaps next to The Hague plan there is no
other world-uniting enterprise which could so much conduce to
prosperity and peace as this one initiated by Italy's King. An
international conference to discuss the plan is to be held in F^me
next month. Although the initiation of governmental action cones
from Italy, the idea originated with a California!!, David Lubin, and
King Victor gives him credit for it in the first paragraph of his
letter. The American convinced him that the idea was practical
and valuable, and for that reason Ihe Italian sovereign recommended
it to his Government.
The proposed chamber is to be permanently in session in Rome.
Delegates to it are to be of two kinds, namely â two-thirds elected
by the agricultural societies of the various countries in proportion
1 to their population and one-third to be appointed *by the Govern
ments represented in the chamber. The action of the chamber is
to be advisory to the national Governments ; to gather and give
information in all matters relating to agriculture, such as estimates
of coming crops, the world's requirements, the fixation of prices, the
promulgation to the farmers of such knowledge as would prevent
them being exploited by transportation trusts and experts in specu
lation : to internationally help toward the extinction of animal and
plant diseases ; the establishment of insurance against loss by hail,
frosts, drought, and the mortality of livestock ; the creation of ex
changes for agricultural products ; and. generally, to propose to
Governments and the parties interested "the measures best suited to
the attainment of objects requiring collective action."
The Italian monarch says that Rome would be a worth}- inn
propitious seat, and he plans that there the authority of the various
Governments and the free energies of the tillers of the soil may
work harmoniously together. Certainly the prestige of Rome in
laying the foundations of universal law and in giving the world its
religious organization would be an inspiration toward making
catholic the scope of any world's work done there : and perhaps,
as agriculture is the foundation of all our prosperity, it may be
that in making a success in this movement toward universal co-opera
tion, she may accomplish as much as anything yet-to her credit in
history. _________ â __ __

"Hey, don't shoot 'em!" yelled the

'"You can have 'em arrested and then

The man still kept his hand in his

looked at the vanishing autoists.

*,\ AM lost." said the PTetty
I Maiden with a quaintly tragic
I air.
She Â»tood back against the
window of a big department store on
Canal street and scanned the surging
crowd before her. It was Manli Gras
day in New Orleans and the Pretty
Maiden had been In town only three
hours, two of which had been spent
in a hotel.
"I have lost my mother," she said
again, as if to impress the fact upon
herself â "and my father" â th?n she
added as an afterthought, "and my
purse."
In the street the people crowded
each other for more room, and there
was a constant etream of maskers, gay
dominoed fellows with tinkling bells
and snapping whips, and the Pretty
Maiden watched them from the en
trance, to the department store, and
her ideas quite lost their balance and
toppled over into the mad whirl of
carnival.
"I'm glad I'm lost," she said to her
self; "they'll know I was separated
from them by the crowd, and they'll
be fearfully worried, but after a while
they'll find me and meantime I feel aa
if something were going to happen â
a wild adventure, perhaps. Oh, I love
Carnival! I'm glad I came."
A drum throbbed subtly in the dis
tance: the crowd surged to the edge
of the banquette, then surged back
again with easy laughter, for no par
ade appeared.
"Ah, " said some one at the Pretty
Maiden's elbow; "I beg your pardon,
but I thought 1 was never going to find
you. The crowd is so thick."
The Pretty Maiden stared. A young
man. clean shaved and eminently pre
sentable, was regarding her, hat in
hand.
"I'm afraid you don't remember
me." he suggested, a trifle crestfallen.
"Isn't this Miss Preston?"
The Pretty Maiden's eye? widened.
To herself she cried, "The adventure!"
but aloud she said quite Â«coolly:
'To afraid the advantage is yours."
"I'm sorry," hi? answered, stiffly.
"But please don't think me an imper
tinent stranger. My cousin wrote me
to meet you here, you and your sister.
She asked me to show you around for
the parade. I â my name is Robert
Randolph. ' he finished awkwardly.
The Pretty Maiden hesitated a bare
moment, but the carnival spirit was
strong within her, and the trick that
In her natural environment would
have been impossible unfolded itself
like magic in this atmosphere.
The moment was a bare one: then â
"Oh." she said, with the friendliest
smile imaginable, "You are Bobby
Randolph?"
"Of course, " he agreed, cheerfully.
"It's. been a great while since we saw
each other, but still â "
"So it has." said the Pretty Maiden,
cunningly. "Let me see just how long
exactly?"
"Just ten years," said Mr. Randolph.
"Ten years, three months, seven days,
two hours and, I think, twenty-seven
minutes."
"Dear me," she murmured breath-
lessly.
"And. by the way. where's your
sister: didn't she come?"
"My sister?" said the Pretty Maiden,
quite astonished. "My sister? OOcrh â er
â yes. of course, she came; but â she
had a fearful headache, and she decid
ed to stay at the hotel: and I hate to
miss the parade, you see."
"Of course. Too bad she won't see
it," said Mr. Randolph regretfully.
"The trip was so long and tiresome."
said the Pretty Maiden incautiously.
"Two hour?' long! I like that. Why.
it's only forty-eight miles between
here and Pass Christian."
"Distance." said the Pretty Maiden
serttentiously. "is not a matter of miles
â with me, at least," she added pru
dently.
Well, we can have a jolly time by
ourselves, anyhow, " Mr. Randolph as
sured her.
The Pretty Maiden hesitated â that
is. she would have hesitated, but Mr.
Randolphs cheerful confidence left
her no room to do so.
They walked on rather slowly, for
the crowd was dense, and Mr. Ran
dolph's shoulders acted as a buffer
more than once.
"We'll have time to go and get
some hot chocolate before Rex gets

could contribute in the least to the
realization of that ideaL"
The little bookâ like all .the rest
of his works, much in little, is ad
dressed" to the school children of i
America and their teachers. Wagner,
himself, has at times been a school
master. Here we have the combina
tion of a pastor and a pedagogue in j
one being who has to a high decree the ,
faculty of saying the strongest things j
in the simplest way. It is the old. old I
subject of ethics to be Impressed upon !
those who are at life's threshold, but
the children to heed it are ever comine
afresh, and now when so many thou- ;
sands of the parents have been zealous
to read "The Simple Life." the oncom- i
ing generation will naturally be Inter- J
ested in what its widely advertised au- j
thor has specially to say to them.
The threshold being "the place of ex
pectation," . there are two ways in
which on the youth the impressions of
ethics then may be made to strike, and
seriousness be empowered to take the j
boy by surprise with its beauty. One
is the art of words in swiftly throwing j
the attractive light on the conduct path ,
that alone leads to happiness and right
power and possession. The other lies In 'â 
the charm of the personality which lifts
aloft the light and points out the oath. '
Excellent in both these ways is Wag
ner's threshold greeting and warning :
to the American children who are pass-
Ing through to make the greater
America of to-morrow.
The book is planned to speak in the
simplest way possible of the greatest j
thing there Is. Life is its subject, and !
it is but an essay, a beginning. There j
is a system to it to cover all the im- j
portant divisions very briefly. He j
starts with "the source of life," and ;
asks "where do we come from?" for
his first division. He leads the mind
to realize that there is a power behind :
the production of all life and this ',
power must. have a name and he says \
"humanity has named It God." Then
he tells how to find that source of all I
life. "Who are we?" is his next di- !
vision, and in that he brings out prin
cipally that we are battlers and that
a fight is what interests us above all I
things. . "Our existence, however
frail and tossed it now appears, has i
nevertheless the impassioned' beauty
of a combat in which are at stake all ;
the greatest interests, the most pre- ;
cious treasures, and in which there is j
nothing that is no account, because j
there is nothing that does not either
increase or lessen the chances qf suc
cess, hasten victory or compromise
it."
In dividing his subject he gives most
of his words to "what are we to do?" \
Here he well explains that great law i
is not arbitrary, but that it is like the j
fact that the decalogue would exist
had there been no Moses and had it i
never been written. Touching on In
dividuality he reminds us of the mot- !
to. Dare to be," and quotes from
Victor Hugo that thought about the
quiet courage of being one's self "In j
spite of risk or ridicule":
In June no smile - embarrasses the roc*
From filling nature's duty to uncloee.
From individuality he passes to i
â¢'solidarity," whose great law is obe- '
dience. . When he" comes to treat of i
:ruth" he says: "To serve truth right- j
ly and to make it agreeable to those
v , o bear us, â  let us choose scrupu- j
lously our time and our words. Let j
us try to unite truth, tact and propri
ety,' benevolence and charity." His
telling of "labor" and "rest" pre
serves well the balance. of those, two j
duties, and when he comes to the lit- j
tle chapter called "the supreme law" j
he shows how the thief lacks kindness j
more than he lacks honesty, the â  liar I
lacks kindness more than frankness,
and so regarding all the faults and
sins it is shiningly set forth that of
all' the virtues the greatest of these
is charity, the supreme law..
So through all the Â parts .of the
' loune of life he leads the youth lum
Â»iously and â¢ when at the end he conies
t> tell the door of death he depre-
fe.tes too much aread of it and hiding
of the thought from the young. When
we are asked where the dead have
gone the best reply is. "They have
gone to God."

GREAT DETECTIVE
WRITES MEMOIRS
True detective stories and lots of
them are told in "The Memoirs of a
Great Detective." by John Wilson
Murray, the chief inspector of crimi
nal investigation of the province of
Ontario. Murray has had a very long,
a very varied and very successful ex
perience in that line of work. He is
now 65 years of age and he began his
career as a detective when quite a
young man. The first case he handled
was a most important one, namely,
the detection and frustration of the
plan of the Confederate, Cole, to cap
ture the U. S. S. Michigan, and with
it to take Johnson Island, in Lake
Erie, and liberate the 4000 Confeder
ate's imprisoned there. The plan was
partly carried out and came very near
being successful, but the skill of Mur
ray thwarted Cole and the men who
were working with him, and in con
sequence of the ability and predilec
tion for unraveling Becrets shown in
that performance, the detective de
cided to devote his whole time to it
as a profession.
There are many interesting accounts
given of peculiar crimes and of the
detection of the guilty by following
slight clews. Some of the stories are
quite amusing, as one called "A King,
a Lunatic and a Burglar," in which
Murray tells of being taken for all
three of these in one night of painful
experience. He explains that detective
work haa no magic in it, but that suc
cess depends on hard application and
experience, just as in any other busi
ness.
The opinions he has formed about
criminology and human nature after
all these long years of such ample ex
perience are noteworthy as a summing
up of what all the stories serve to
teach. He believes that crime is a
disease and that it is hereditary; that
it may skip a generation, or even two
or three, but it is an inherent and in
herited weakness. He also believes
that "once dishonest always dis
honest" is the general rule. He
says crooks as a whole are honorable
in their peculiar way, that is, they
have a code of honor, and, although
it is always paradoxical, they adhere
to it. Criminals are usually very grate
ful for what they consider favors, and
the detective's art largely consists in
skillfully using this trait. One of the
exasperations of the sleuths! profes
sion Is that often when they know to a
certainty that they could lay their
hands on the perpetrators of evil deeds
they have to wait for evidence that
could convict, and sometimes thia evi
dence never comes.
Murray believes strongly In circum
stantial evidence. The falsity of direct
evidence is a much more likely thing
than that circumstances will combine
to indicate falsely. .The great gift of
the detective is to know how to recog
nize a lie, and by listening to a lot of
lies be able to drag the truth out from
the midst of the cunning falsehood.
"As a detective advances in his busi
ness he will find that the more he stu
dies and works the stronger his pow
ers of intuition, of divination and of
analysis become."
Some of the most satisfying of his
conclusions are that few men make a
success of crime; that crime Is not in
creasing out of proportion to the in
crease in population; that there are
very few criminals of genius; a fair
share of those who ought to be In pris
on eventually get there; that the de
tective's contact with the worst ele
ments of humanity does not take away
the belief that this world is a grand
place and life a glorious thing.

NOVEL O FRO ME
BY SHIPBUILDER
From the work of shipbuilding in the
yards of the fames Cramps to writ
ing romances seems a far cry. but Wal
ter $ Cramp, who studied shipbuilding
in the yards of his father and uncles,
has, since the sale of those great plants,
been gratifying his chief desire which
was the study of ancient, medieval and
modern Rome. Out of that study has
come the historical novel, "Psyche, a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 23. 1905.
Romance of the Reign of Tiberius,"
which vividly recalls the life of that
dreadful time. The book has several
good illustrations from drawings made
by W. T. Benda.
Psyche, the heroine of the story, is
a beautiful Greek dancer, betrothed to
Gygea, a charioteer in the Roman cir
cus. The historic characters sketched
are the Emperor, the Emperor's favor
ite, Sejanus, who is at the time com
mander of the Pretorian guards;
Agrippina, tHe noble widow of Ger
manicus, and Livilla, the corrupt wife
of Drusus. Psyche, seeking to find out |
how Lavilla's beauty appeared to a j
man's eyes, asked her brother to tell j
her about this daughter-in-law of the i
Emperor. The brother is not in love
with her, yet he says, "So beautiful and {
stately is she, my sister, that I feel, j
when I stand before her, as if I stood i
in a temple, beholding a living god
dess."
A passage chosen for strong presen
tation both by word and picture is the
temptation by Lavilla of the handsome |
youth who is Psyche's brother, The
young Greek has been reared stricter
than are the ways of Rome, and he
becomes frightened and suspicious of
the beautiful woman. He plays a
Parsifal part to Lavilla's Kundry, but
in this case the reward of virtue was
sudden death.
The account of the poisoning of Dru
sus, Lavilla's husband, and the super
subtle way in which it is accomplished,
give another opportunity for good de
scription and good picturing. It is a
relief to turn from the somber por
trayals of scoundrelism which take up
bo much of the book to the beautiful
characters of Psyche and of Agrippina;
but even there we must be sad in fol
lowing them through their misfortunes.
The best picture in the book shows
these two women on their way to a long
imprisonment. Agripplna's wrists
were bound together by chains. "Re
freshed by the salt breezes, Agrippina
and Psyche sat upon the deck of the
vessel and watched the smooth sea re
flecting the setting sun. The great orb
was just hovering in glory over the
waters, and the skies were aglow with
small flaming clouds, clustered near
the horizon. The peace that always
comes with the sunset hour brooded
over the waters."
During the last few years the author
has lived In Italy and the northern part
of Africa, and has particularly de
voted his time to the study of the in
teresting periods of Rome during the
reigns of Augustus and Tiberius.

STORY OF A DOG,
MAN AND WOMAN
Bill, the lovably faithful bulldog in
i that true story of true love and remark-
I able history of man's regeneration
called "My Mamie Rose," would serve
well as a poster to advertise that con
fession as being some of the best liter
ature that could be used in settlement
work in the big and wicked cities. The
book would take hold, with a bulldog
grip, of the imagination of every man
who is toughing it in the slums, but
who has mind enough to enjoy a good
story, and it would never let go until
It and admiration for the dog dragged
the mart out from the haunts of vice
to the parks â and all the possibilities
of the better thoughts and high re
solves that might come in such fitter
contemplation place.
"It's dogged as does it," said an old
woman once, and we all know what
that means In toil, endurance, re

nunciation, achievement â the bearing
of defeat or the bringing of victory.
Bulldog pertinacity is a mental con
cept humanity should be grateful that
it is heir to.
There !s just out a new edition of
the autobiography of Owen Kildare,
which he named "My Mamie Rose,"
after the sweetheart who redeemed
him, and this time it is in cheaper
form to popularize it, for the demand is
great and it has gone through eight
editions. The book in its first form
was reviewed in these pages, but the
effort to meet the popular demand
half way with this more easily obtain
able reprint is well worth calling at
tention to. If any one wishes a true
story, interesting as a piece of elected
fiction, of how a most romantic refor
mation of a bad man happened, and
how a dog did his part in it almost
manfully, and of how just three words
from a woman's lips, "Don't go there."
made a true man out of a degraded
tough, let them read about "My Mamie
Rose."
Also of psychological interest will
they find the study of that chapter of
"The Beginning of the Miracle," which
tells of how the for thirty years tough
ened tough, for the first time In his
life, defended a woman from insult;
and of how he meant to go with her
guardtngly for one block but went two,
then three, and on and on, because, it
being the first time he was ever escort
to a lady, he was afraid he might be
awkward in bidding adieu. He did not
know how to do it, and dared not try.
He tells it thus (remember he has
learned to write successful books after
thirty years of complete illiteracy): "I
was in the dilemma of wanting to be
a gentleman, a courtier to my queen,
and not knowing how to be one." So
block by block the influence of the
woman had time to get in Its spell
charm work; and when at her door
step she said of the debauchery dive
whence came the man, 'Don't go
there," he didn't; and out of that, by
the dog's assistance, came splendid re
demption.
No stereotyped love story is this,
however, of "lived happily ever after,"
for his Mamie Rose died a few weeks
before the time set for her to marry
Owen Kildare. Raging against Ood
and all things, the lover drove every
one out of the room so he might be
.alone with his dead. The bulldog, Bill,
pressed close to his dead mistress. In
that moment of rebellious grief the
evil of the redeemed man transiently
returned. He kicked the dog brutally
across the room. For the first time in
his life the dog defied him and came
again close to tho woman he loved.
"Through that bitter night man and
dog kept their silent vigil beside the
bier of her whom both had loved."
The record reminds one of Dr. John
Brown's famous little classic of a short
story, "Rab and His Friends." Bill's
is the best dog story since Rab oc
curred.

York; $1.)
"THE QUAKERESS:"
A TALE OF LOVE
Somber gray as the dress of the
Society of Friends is the love story
of "The Quakeress," by Charles He
ber Clark (Max Adler), who is quali
fied by a long residence among them
to make a true portrayal of the Quak
ers of Pennsylvania. Abbey Woolford,
who is the Quakeress, is as sweet and
attractive as nature, religion and love
can conspire to make a woman.
One of her lovers, the big, strong:,
religious farmer, who is of her own
faith and whom she has known all
her life, seems of right to be the man
she would love, but nature would not
have it so, and after she meets the
Marylander, Clayton Hartley, the
complications of affection come which
make the strong joys and sorrows of
her life. Until she felt the attraction
of this youth, who was such a con
trast to the Quaker squire, her life
had known only the quiet happiness
of tranquillity and peace.
The tale is made up of a sort of
double love story, and the other at
tractive woman is Dolly Hartley, the
sister of the Marylander. She Is a
very vivacious person and is attracted
by the great strength and character
of Abbey's Quaker lover. She has
some romantic love passages with the
big, sternly religious squire, while his
aid sweetheart. Abbey, is in love with
Clayton, but the big fellow restrains
himself from yielding to her fascin
ation, not because he does not feel the
force of her attractiveness, but be
cause he has decided on one love only,
and will have Abbey or no wife at all.
Dolly's pretty and modest coquetry
makes quite a feature of the romance
and we are quite convinced that she
was acting wifh feeling and sincerity.
So there is play, pathos and sorrow
all through the story and a strong per
vasion of stern religious feeling and
conviction. Abbey, in confessing to
Clayton that she cannot help but love
him, tells him of her belief that her
involuntary love is an offense in God's
sight. The contrast between the
and the cavalier family is part
of the book's power, and by some
strange law of liking contrasts the
Southern girl loves the Quaker squire,
and Abbey and the Marylander find
none among their own people with such
power to attract them.
It is the charm of Abbey Woolford
which makes the novel best worth
reading. A beautiful picture of her is
used as frontispiece of the book, and
because of the sweetness of it and the
text of the tale, reading ver true to
the face we love to look at, there is
a zeal to follow out the story and find
out all about her happiness and trou
bles. Her lover, the big Quaker squire,
cherishes this picture after Abbey's
death. "He locked much at her pic
ture, taken before she had met the
Southerners. He saw the sweet lips
with the faint smile upon them; the
dear brown eyes, the lovely hair, the
tender soul looking out upon him. It
was beautiful and full of grace; but,
after all, this is only white paper and
brown shadow, and she has gone for
ever and forever."
(John C. Winston Company, Phila
delphia; $1 50.)
CON VERSA TIONS
IN AIRY STYLE
Very light reading, indeed, is the se
ries of conversations called "The Di
gressions of Polly," by Helen Roland,
which is now reproduced in book form
with a very pretty picture of Polly for
frontispiece, and several other good il
lustrations. The book is after the style
of the "Dolly Dialogues," and no doubt
that exceedingly clever thing made Its
method popular enough for something
more on the same order to be called for.
Folly's digressions are bright and play
ful conversations between a man and
woman, and told in the first person by
the masculine admirer of the girl, who
lets her opinions come trippingly from
the tongue and is never supposed to be
serious although she is sometimes wise.
It is all too frothy to be taken seri
ously, too playful to be frowned quite
away. It is largely make-believe con
tention between a man and woman who
love each other, and who thus tend to
find mutually acceptable ground for
common-sense settlement of the lighter
of life's differences. The subjects cover
a wide range, but are mainly about
love, the management of yachts and
men, the lost art of proposing, the folly
of confession, platonic affection and
man's argument and woman's reason.
In this last, that most wonderful thing,
"a woman's because," comes in for
some comment and elucidation. Polly's
comprehension of a woman's "because'
shows it to be a much more important
thing than is woman's intuition, as es
timated , by the callously unadmiring
skeptic, who defined intuition to be
that marvelous power by which a wo
man positively knows a- thing is so
when it isn't.
One of the best chapters is the one
called "Effective Imperfections." We
all know there are such things, but we
must be thankful to Polly for charm
ingly reminding us not to forget that
they exist all around us and in some of
our best friends. The best illustrated
chapter is the one called 1 "In Defence of
Plato, 4 in which Polly, while out in a
boat with a man, and only
thftjr two there, not only bod
ify but also metaphorically In the
same boat as to the predicament of
their affections, protests that there is
such a thing as platonic love. Its ex
istence elsewhere might have been suc
cessfully maintained by the arguments
of the lsWy. but it was banished from
the boat,j and her beautiful, bejeweled
hands quit their playing in the water
to play affectionately in the man's hair
when the chapter and the discussion
ended.

W. D. Howells, who has been In Italy
for the past year, has left Genoa, and
is now on his way to America. He will
probably go to his home at Kitterv
Point, Maine, for the summer. A new
novel by Mr. Howells is in preparation,
and will be published by the Harpers
in a couple of months.

| hibiting a personal indecision of choice
j between the two. Mr. Alden prints in

j Mrs. Margaret Deland. who is ac
; qualnted with the author. The Doem
was composed automatically, so to
speak, by a woman of middle ase UDon
awaking from a sound sleep. She had
j never written a line of verse in her life.
I The poem is a cv*ioua psychic docu
ment. its sentiment being entirely alien
to the facts of the author s life.
Harris Dickson, the author of "The
Ravanels," who lately was elevated to
the newly created Municipal Court of
Vicksburg, Miss., has been going
through a curious experience.. The le
gality of the creation of this court, fal
lowing Mr. Dickson's election, was at
tacked vigorously, and it was only after
a hard fight that its continuance was
established by the Circuit Court. Mr.
Dickson himself has been under a fire
of criticism owing to his vigorous in
terpretation of the law governing the
carrying of concealed deadly weapons.
The first case brought before him was
that of a man who had been carrying
a pistol, and Mr. Dickson fined him
half of the full amount of the fine laid
down by the law, staring, at the samÂ».
that the next offender would be given
the full penalty.

LONDON, April 22.â 1t is learned
from a private source that Lady Cur
son's condition since her return to In
dia is again causing grave anxiety to
Lord Curzon and her physicians.
The attack began with bad head
aches, accompanied by great sickness
and high fever, with 103 temoeratur*
supervening, accompanied by delirium.
For two days she fell back into the
serious state which excited such con
cern during her illness at Walmer

Lord Cunon sat up with her night
after night, wearing himself out com

to his heavy official duties. It is very
probable that when she gets sufficient
ly well Lady Curzon will return home.
She should never have gone back to

burning of which was told exclusively
in The Call yesterday morning, will
amount to early $10,000. Eight
ho?ses perished and some valuable ve
hicles were damaged. To the employes
of the stables and the firemen is due
great credit in liberating 120 other
arimals that were in the building
v hen the fire broke out. A rumor
was circulated about town yesterday
that the blaze was of incendiary origin
and was started , by friends of the
stablemen, who struck some time ago.
M:-.nagpr Pearce fought the strikers
bitterly. The proprietor, however,
emphatically denies the rumor and
says th* fire started near the roof of
ft'-i* building and was caused by de
|Z9ct>ye electric light wires.

WOMAN WORKS
A NEW SWINDLE
Poses as Guest of St. Fran
cis and Orders Valuable
Goods From Local Firms
POLICE ON HER TKAIL
Visits Hostelry and Takes
Names of Prominent Per
sons From the Kegister
The more prominent of the guests
of the St. Francis Hotel have lateiy
! been suffering considerable annoyance
through the actions of a woman who
has been using their names to I secure
I goods from local merchants. For sev
â  eral weeks a middle-aged woman 'has
I been daily visiting the St. Francis and
quietly looking over the register.
From the list of arrivals she has tak
en the names of guests who appeared
to have > plenty of means and good
standing at the hotel. Witn .'iif-se
names the woman has gone to th^
various dry goods stores and millinery
phops and ordered goods which she
has. had charged to the St. :â  Francis
guests. .
One mode of operation was â 10 or
der several dresses, in the selection of
which she would display a taste that
would'readily/suggest, to the salesman
â  that she was, in the habit of ordoii':.?
the best. Then she would v pick out a
cloak, remarking that she would take
it along with her and instruct thÂ«
salesman to send the other articles to
the hotel, where she said the cashier
had been instructed to pay" the bill.
When any doubt was entertainsi. by
[ th" firm as to the woman's H uidi'ij?
| the hotel would be communicated with
by telephone and in response to the
query as to whether Mrs. So-and-.So
was all right the answer would, of
course, be that she was a guest at the
hotel and any . reasonable bill would
bo paid. But when the goods were
delivered to the guest's rooms she
would protest that she had not or
dered .them and a great deal of con
fusion would res"ult. â¢â 
For. several days' past a detective
j has been .stationed, in the hotel pa-
I tiently, waiting for the mysterious
1 woman to reappear, but evidently she
| realizes that her game has played it
self out and she is keeping away. The
hotel management has its suspicions
strongly directed toward a certain
| woman, a description of whom it has
I furnished the police and the detective
â  employed by the local merchants. :

ANOTHER DEPUTY
IS IN TROUBLE
Internal Revenue Collector
Revels in High Life on
Money He Borrowed Freely
HOT PACE ENDS IN JAIL
Clairvoyant Warnings Wife
Have Given Are of
Xo Avail to Gay Husband
Ismael. the clairvoyant of that
name, failed to foresee the peril into
which her husband was plunging, or
having seen .At" neglected to warn him.
and becau'sr of such failure and neg
lect another deputy internal revenue
collector is .in trouble. Her husband,
who is known to the public as Sack
etl Cornell, is in jail and must face a
serious charge.
United States Internal Revenue Col
lector Lynch and Special Revnue
Agent Rert M. Thomas some time ago
appointed Cornell a deputy internal
revenue collector. He attended faith
fuli-- to his duties until March 11, on
which rate he received an order from
Thomas to go to San Luis obispo. The
deputy went not thither and com
munication between himself and the
office in this city w;is severed. In
cidentally it was learned that he was
reveling in the joys of his iife inM^os
Angeles and that patrons of the ijner
nal revenue department from Fresno
to Los Angeles had advanced him va
rious sums of money upon his repre
sentation that he needed the coin for
traveling expense^ and that he would
return the loans his salary ar
rived.
At Los Ange'tes he induced United
States District Attorney Valentine to
advance him $50 upon his salary that
had already been collected. Thomas
made inquiries in many places to as
certain Cornell's address in order to
notify him of his dismfssal from the
service, but nobody, not even the
clairvoyant, knew or would tell.
Finally the wanderer was heard of
in Santa Barbara, where he had bor
rowed small sums from several per
sons who were acquainted with Thom
as and Lynch and who did not sus- â 
peel that one of their deputies could
by any possibility do anything wrong.
Deputy Frank H. Driscoll was sent
after Cornell and arrested him in the
seaside resort yesterday morning.
The complaint upon which the war- ]
rant was issued charges the prisoner
with having violated the Federal stat
ute which makes it a crime. for any |
deputy who fails to perform his duties
as required by law. The maximum
penalty is one year's imprisonment.

PROPERTY OWNERS ARE
LIABLE FOB IMPROVEMENT
City Attorney Says They Must Stand \
Expense of Bftiiminlzing Point
I,obos Avenue.
City Attorney Long yesterday ad- !
vised the Supervisors that the prop
erty owners on Point Lobos avenue
are liable for the improvement of the :
thoroughfare under the provisions of j
chapter 2 of article 6 of the charter.
The opinion was requested as the re- !
suit of a petition to determine -wheth
er the city or the Park Commissioners .
should pay the expense of bituminiz- ;
ing the street. lx>ng says:
"The charter provides that 'all ,
lÂ»arks and squares of the city and
county shall be under the exclusive
control and management of the Park
Commisiponers.' Rut Point .Lobos
avenue is not a park, as shown above,
but is a street, and no provision has â 
been made by rharter for the im
provement and control of Point Lobos
avenue by' the Park Commissioners,
as was done with the Great Highway.
"Point Lobos avenue is traversed
by a street railway from its junction
with Geary street at Central avenue
to Ninth avenue and from Thirty third
to Forty-eighth avenue, or for more .
than half its entire length. And it j '
may be questioned whether the Board J
of Supervisors may even declare Point |
Lobos avenue a boulevard under the j
power conferred upon it 'to set apart :
as a boulevard any street or portion !
of a street over which there is no ex
isting franchise for any street rail
road.' "
.MIST PAVE ONLY SPACE
OCCUPIED BY THE RAIIjS
lily Attorney Define.* Obligations of
Street Kailroad Companies Where
One Ttack Is Abandoned.
City Attorney Long yesterday ad
vised the Board of Works that rail
road companies are compelled to pave
as required by law only between and
on each side of such tracks as are
laid, regardless of what space may
have been heretofore occupied by
â¦.hem or intended to be hereafter used
by them.
The opinion was desired in view of
the fact thru the United Railroads
holds franchises for double tracks on
Several streets, but has installed sin
gle tracks in lieu thereof. The Board
of Works thought the corporation
should pay for the paving of the
width ot the double tracks, although
but one is being utilized. Long says:
"The law would seem to contem
plate that street railroads are required
only- to 'plank, pave or macadamize
ihe entire length of that portion of
the street occupied by the track or
tracks and a spv.ee on either side nf
the railb, together with a space be
tween the tracks, if there be more
than one. I take it this applies only
to such tracks as are laid and not 10
Fuch spaces as may have been used
or may be intended to be hereafter oc
cupied by tracks."

FEDERAL, GOVERNMENT TO
. 'TRANSFER ITS LABORATORY
Public Health Commission l>evide>
That Consumptive Chinese Must
Be Under Surveillance.
The Public Health Commission held
a meeting yesterday at the City Hall.
with Dr. Martin Regensburger pre
siding. Dr. D. A. Curry, head of the
United States marine and hospital
service, who has succeeded Dr. Ru
pert Blue, reported that he had re
ceived orders from his department to
remove the laboratory to Angel Isl
and. The laboratory has been ex
tensively used in connection with the
inspection of diseases in the Chinese
quarters. Its transfer will necessitate
the doing of the work by the local
Health Board. Part of the work con
sists of performing autopsies on dead
rats found in Chinatown. As the lo
cal laboratory department has all it
can attend to now it is probable that
this portion of the work will be dele
gated to some of the physicians in the
employ of the board.
The commission discussed the mat
ter of the maintenance of some thirty
consumptive Chinese who are being
tilted for at the Oriental dispensary
on Sacramento street. It was the
opinion of th<Â» commission that these
patients should.be sent to a separate
pavilion in the County Hospital. Dr.
Hassier was directed to confer with
the Chinese Six Companies to learn if
they are willing to supply the food for
the patients if the city cares for them.
In the event that such arrangements
cannot be made the Supervisors will
be asked to provide funds for a Chi
nese cook, as is done in the leper hos
pital. Before the consumptives were
taken to the dispensary it was their
habit to locate near undertaking shops
in rooms designated as "chambers of
tranquillity." The commission is of
opinion *that they should be kept un
der surveillance in order to prevent
the spread of the disease.

that Emperor Nicholas has ordered
Admiral Rojestvenskys squadron to

The Foreign office received advices
from St. Petersburg this morning
showing that the instructions sent to

The Navy Department has issued

about the Russian " second Pacific
squadron in Kamranh Bay:
. "Two cruisers, one with three masts
and two funnels, of the Dmitri Don- !

and three funnels, were seen cruis
ing outside of the harbor. Two four
masted merchantmen and a one-fun- ;

-Five vessels resembling: battleships
were anchored inside the harbor. Two
battleships with two masts and three
funnels, flying admiral's ' flags, were
anchored-inside the harbor.
"Six warships,, anchored in single
formation, lay outside the harbor, off
Its southern entrance.; Heavy smoke
was seen rising inside the harbor."
Although the report . does â¢ not say !

FANATICS TAKE TO HILLS
AND TORTIRE THEMSELVES
Band of One Hundred Penitents Imi
tate Crucifixion at Colony in
Colorado.
TRINIDAD, Colo., April 22. At
Longs Canyon there is a penitents'
colony of 100 persons. Their torture
ceremony was witnessed to-day by a
few persons who hid themselves be
hind rocks and trees in the nearby
hilte.
The ceremony consists of a march
from the church to a cross stationed
at the farther end of the holy ground.
The penitents crawled most of the
distance. The columns of worshipers
were headed by two young: girls
dressed in white and wearing long
veile. These two represented the two
Marys. They carried out the cruci
fixion by nailing a wooden image to
the cross.
Most of the whipping is done in the
hills away from the holy grounds.
While the outsiders were watching,
two men came in from the hills, whip
ping themselves as they ran. They
wore only short white trousers, with
veils over their faces. They used a
braided rope, striking first over one
shoulder and then the other. One of
them had cut a deep triangle in his
back, while the wound of the other
was oval shaped. Blood poured from
the wounds and the whips were clot
ted. Each time they lashed them
selves the whips stuck and were
pulled out with a swishing noise. The
men were weak and tired as they ran
toward the church.

the French ; Moroccan- policy.' and Rou
vier is accredited with ' the desire Â£ not
to .have the Moroccan issue j drift â¢ into
dangerous complications. Only the So

FIRM MOROCCAN POLICY.
The feeling over Germany , has nat
urally become much more acute as a

Check for Thi3 Sum to Reach Hex in

Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, April 2:.â Within a few
days Mrs. Fannie Chaffee Grant of
San Diego, Cal., will receive a check
for $150,000. representing her equity
in the Kittredge building In this city,
and when she acknowledges receipt of
the check she will pay a tribute of
gratitude to David H. MofCat, to
whom she is indebted for every penny
that comes to her from the sale of the
property, which yesterday brought
$300,000.
Years ago David H. Moffat and Je
rome B. Chaffee, once Senator from,
Colorado, formed a partnership. They
organized the First National Bank
and Senator Chaffee was at one time
president of the institution. Senator
Chaffee invested heavily in real estate
and included in his holdings the Kitt
redge building. Years after, the death
of ' Senator Chaffee came the panic of
1893. The estate. had suffered re
verses and * the Klttredge block was
about to be sacrificed. A mortgage
for $150,000 was held against the
block by the Northwestern Insurance
Company and ft made a demand for
the money, under threat of foreclo
sure. ' . .-â :'-â -â. ,:-.'
MOFFAT TO THE RESCUE.
David H. Moffat learned of the dis
aster about to overtake the daughter
of his late partner. He assured Mrs.
Grant that her heritage would be
saved to her. The financial agent of
the Northwestern was called in and.
after a few preliminaries, the neces
sary papers were signed and the
amount of the trust deed was paid
over to him.
In order to further protect the in
terest of Mrs. Grant the title to the
property was for a period vested In
Fred G. Moffat. After all danger of
loss had passed the property was re
transferred to Mrs. Grant and was in
her name until sold to Bennett & My
ers yesterday.
If the block had been sold during
the panic under foreclosure proceed
ings there is little doubt that it would
have brought hardly more than the
incumbrance. Moffat realized this,

REFUSES EXECUTOR'S FEES.
In . recalling this story, old business
friends of Moffat and Chaffee are re
minded of the action of Moffat when
the will of Senator Chaffee was be
ing executed. Moffat was named as
executor under the will and in set
tling the estate of . Senator Chaffee
values to the amount of more than
$1,000,000 passed through his hands.
When Moffat made his final statement
of his stewardship and asked to be dis
charged, the court suggested that he
had failed to present his bill for execu
tor's fees against the estate. Moffat's
reply was characteristic.
"We were partners on the square
when he was alive." he said; "and we
will be partners on the square now
that he is dead." V
The executor's fees, reckoned on a
5 per cent basis, which is allowed by
law. would have given - Moffat more
than $50,000.

street," the man said, "and gome one
has been murdered." â¢
Staub was suspicious and tried to
catch the fellow, but he darted away
and was lost in the darkness. But the
watchman had taken a good look at
him.
Yesterday afternoon while on an Ed
dy street car bound for the Richmond
District, Staub saw th,e same man
coming: out of a drug store. The watch
man got off the car and seired the
fellow. The suspect, was taken to Cap
tain Burnett's office and questioned
closely. Burnett was far from satis
fied with the fellow's account of him
self and he was ordered held.
The suspect said hi* name was W. H.
Rtdell. He declared that he formerly
lived at San Jose and that he had
worked in this city as an agent for the
Occidental Insurance Company. He
has been out of work for some time
and claimed that he was on his way
to the Second street wharf to gL-t shel
ter for the night when the shooting oc
curred. As he passed Brutt's grocery
ho says he saw two men standing at
the entrance and another on the edge
of the sidewalk. One had a stiff hat
on, he says, and the other wore a soft
dark hat. That was the only descrip
tion he could grive.
When Ridell had gone about a block
he hpard shots and the man with the
stiff hat ran down past him and dis
appeared in an iron yard. Ridell could
not explain why he told Staub that a
man had been murdered, but after a
severe sweating said that he thought
a man must have been killed.
THEORY OF RILLING.
Ridell is an opium fiend and ad
mitted that he had been arrested in
Seattle for using the drug. The oolice
are investigating his antecedents.
The fact that Reilly was killed by a
thirty-eight caliber bullet and that'
Brutt shot with a revolver of that
caliber does not impress the police
with the notion that it was a bullet
from Brutt's pistol that ended Reillv's
life. Five shots were fired, two by
Brutt.
From the location of the wound it
seems impossible that the fatal bullet
was fired by Brutt. He was on the left
of Reilly and the robber who entered
from Second street was faciner Reillv
at the time Brutt dove behind the bar.
The bullet could only have come from
behirrt the swinging doors, where the
j confederate lurked.
Brutt only saw one man. the masked
thug who entered from the Second
', street doors. H. Verney, who lives in
| the neighborhood, saw a man run out
of the grocery shortly after the shoot
ing. This substantiates the belief that
there was a second man and that he
i fired the fatal shot.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 23, 1905.
BATTLE WITH
HOLD-UP MEN
OAKLAND, April 22.â A masked man
undertook to hold up the grocery of
Samuel Henas, at 961 East Fourteenth
street, last night, and when Manuel
Caspar and John Mendes, who were in
the place, refused to throw up their
bands and hurled canned goods at the
robber instead he opened fire on them
with a revolver, firing four shots in ajl.
The rain of tinned foodstuffs kept the
hold-up man dodging and his aim was
poor in consequence, neither of his tar
gets being hit by the flying bullets.
The robber crept stealthily into the
store and his presence was not known
until a gruff voice spoke the startling
command, "Throw up your hands."
Caspar and Mendes refused to do so
and quickly took shelter behind tho
counter. They opened on the intruder
with a volley of canned, goods that were
conveniently at hand on the shelves.
At every opportunity, when the men
raised their heads above the counter,
the robber sent a bullet after them. He
fired four times without doing any
damage. The robber sheltered himself
finally behind a door from the bom
bardment of cans. After discharging
his revolver four times the hold-up man
hastily left the store and ran down
Fourteenth street.
The store was literally, a wreck when
the battle was aver. Every window
was demolished and shelf fffÂ£>4* : were
strewn about the floor as ityfj(swKÂ»nÂ»6f3
cyclone had been playing havoc. Z -2. â 'Â£â >
It was shortly after 10: when the
robber made his appearance. ? He wore
a white mask over his face. ; He had a
black siouch hat and a dark suit. -f He
is described as being a little below the
medium height arid weighed I about 160
pounds. ,' ' . - '-'â '..
After the . robber disappeared from
the store Caspar and Mendes did not go
immediately to.. the door, but waited a
few- minutes as a precaution. When
they did go |to the ! door they saw the
hold-up man going down \ Fourteenth
street. The police were on the scene
shortly afterward. t - "

William If. Scott, formerly of Tono- I

Smith's saloon, where the Utter ana j
La Rouch and Scott engaged in dice j
shaking, which cost La Rouch $108.
Later the trio went into a back ronm
and played poker, and again La Rouch i
was a loser, this time to the extent j
of $60. While the game was in progress.
Conrad; who did not take part, satis- j
lied himself that a mirror was being

WHEAT PIT
THE SCENE
OF A PANIC
! Sensational Drop in
I Price for May
Delivery,
Gates Believed to Have Ef
fected a Combination
With Armour.
1 â 
jLa:e Antagonists Join Hands for
a Mammoth "Corner" of
July Options.
'â HICAGO. April 22.â One of the most
ceh-brated deals ever known on the
Chicago Board of Trade came to a cli
max to-day.
A daring effort by John W.
Gates and associates to control all of
the wheat available in America for de
livery during the month of May was
apparently ended with a wholesale sac
rifice of prospective profits to escape
possible huge losses on existing invest
ments. Incidentally the result was
one of the wildest sessions ever wit
nessed in the Chicago wheat pit. At one
time prices showed a loss of 11 2 cents
a bushel for the day. the price of the
option being driven down in a sensa
tional series of rushes to 98 l Acents per
bushel. The closing quotatlOT was SI,
us against $1 Â£3 less than six weeks
ago.
The general cpinion to-night is that
Gates and his friends emerged from
the battle with little If any actual loss.
< . ssip insists that they effected an al
liance with Armour and other leading
traders whereby the Gates party, while
obliged summarily to liquidate May
wheat on an enormous scale 10-day,
was nevertheless protected by its prior
operations and by its allies in both
May and later options.
PLANNING A JVLY "CORNER."
Another view of the situation, ac
cording to some observers, is that the
new grouping of astute speculators, in
cluding the redoubtable Gates, has
cleared the r^ad for a still more gi
gantic miner ,in wheat for delivery
during: July.
The idea is that the high price here
tofore prevailing for May wheat has
induced a scouring of the country by
grain traders to procure wheat to sell
to the bull leaders. Hy dropping the
price 1" cent* a bushel to-day the
speculators assumed to be in control
have made it Hear that, while the
country is raked over for wheat to
bring hf-re. they mean to buy it at a
figure of iheir own making. The rush
iiic "t the price down to-day, it was
argued, â was a more drastic action than
was for thÂ« moment at least required
by the Gales and Armour interests, the
result being that they accordngly
Jumped the prioe back to $1 a bushel.
The Gates party, it is said, had fig
ured that the movement to market
would be practically exhausted before
th^ month of May arrived. The factor
that is alleged to have caused it to
â j.i\e up the deal was the steadiness
with which heavy shipments from the
interior continued, and the disappoint
ing, long-drawn-out dullness or the
flour demand and the apparent uncon
cern of the mills.
WHEAT PIT IX A FREXZV.
Th*Â» scenes attending to-day's start
ling decline were such as are seldom
witnessed In the world's greatest wheat
pit. Aln;(^st frenzied with anxiety, the
traders in the pit, awaiting the open
ing bell, huddled like steers about to
stampede. The sound of the big bell
was the signal for a mighty roar of
voices, a din possibly never before
equaled, according to men who were
present at the stormy sessions that
marked thp most exciting periods in
the famous Leiter and Harper deals.
Clothing was torn, hats smashed and
bodies bruised in the frantic efforts of
the traders to sell the grain. Shorts
had apparently completely covered and
loose, little and large, hurled their
grain at the hands that were closed
against it. Nobody seemed to want
wh^at above SI.
When $1 was reached the wild roar
that marked the opening was doubled
in volume. But while the near-by op
tion was plunging downward there was
a steady buying movement going on in
July. Broker*, presumably working
fur Armour and his associates, whether
including Gates or not. were taking on
liberal lots of the latter option. In
or.c h<_'ur alone, it ".vas estimated, these
brokers bought more than 3,000,000
bushels. Tl.e buying of July prompted
frightened shorts to cover, they be
lieving that the Gales forces and the
A'rnour crowd had combined to bull
the month at the expense of the hard
hannnered May.
To-night it was estimated that 5,
000,0t>0 bushels of the May delivery were
unloaded here and In Minneapolis.

DEFEAT AIMS
OF PRESIDENT
Executive's Choice for Chief
Clerk in Bureau of Ameri
can Republics Turned Down
OPPOSITION TBIUMPHS
Governing Board Selects
William C. Wells Instead
of a Friend of Koosevelt
WASHINGTON, April 22.â For the
past two weeks the governing board of
the Bureau of American Republics
has been trying to select a successor
to William C. Fox as chief clerk, he
having been promoted to be a director.
The promotion in his case was at the
instance of President Roosevelt and
the ratification of his choice was not
accomplished without come difficulty,
owing to the belief on the part of the
governing board that they alone had
(he right to fill the offices in the
bureau.
When it came to the selection of the
chief clerk this feeling grew much
stronger, ac it was learned that the
President again had a choice for this
place in the person of Gordon Cum
mings. at present an employe of the
Census Office and a prominent figure
in Washington society.
Led by the representatives of Mex
ico and Chile, an organization was ef
fected which triumphed to-day at a
meeting of the governing board, when
William C. Wells of the District of Co
lumbia was selected, receiving eight
votes as ogainat five votes for Cum
min Js.

Loeb, a stockholder of the Pacific
Brewing; and Malting Company of Ta
coma. has begun suit to force the
company to render larger dividends.
He alleges the profits are so great
that the company can easily declare
dividends of 30 per cent annually on

that tho company be forced to sell its
capita! stock In the Washington
Brewing Company of Everett, the Co
lumbia Brewing Company of Tacoma
and the Puget Sound Malting Com
pany of Tacoma 1 , and that the funds
so secured be converted into dividends.
Loeb is owner of the Independent
Brewing Company of Seattle and a mi
nority stockholder in the Pacific Brew
ing and Malting Company, which is
operated by William Virges and Anton
Ruth. For five years the latter have
been expanding their business and
gradually building a plant costing more
than half a million dollars. They
claim the company's profits have jjone
into betterments. Loeb was chief
owner of the Milwaukee Brewing Com
pany, which the Virges Company ab
sorbed several years ago following a
bitter beer war.

TRUSTY STOPS
A JAIL BREAK
Special Dispatch to Trie Call.
PORTLAND, April 22â Frank Selee,
a 15-year-old trusty In * the Mult
nomah county jail, at 7 o'clock to-night
thrust a pistol in the faces of the lead
ers of twenty-five escaping prisoners
and calling for help prevented the
largest jail break in the history of the
institution. Dan Murphy, a prisoner
who had been scrubbing during the
day, had quietly loosened the lock from
one of the back doors. He planned a
general break, Uut was the only one to
get outside. He was captured by a
deputy sheriff before he had scaled the
fence.
Selee saw Murphy's suspicious ac
tions and got a revolver from an office
drawer. Deputy Sheriff Downey was
elsewhere about the jail when the pris
oners made a rush for the door. There
was the boy with the revolver.
"Stand back!" he shouted, and began
to yell for Downey. The leaders were
cowards and those in the gang behind
thought a deputy blocked the way and
tamely submitted. Selee collapsed when
he realized what danger he had been
through. The prisoners have sworn "to
fix" the boy.

THREE MEN DIE
IN RAIL WRECK
Speclal Dispatch to The Call.
CHEYENNE. Wyo., April 22.-The
WOOt railroad accident that has oc
curred on the Union Pacific since the
Azura head-end collision, in which
j eleven men lost their lives, took place
at the Edson tunnel, 125 miles west of
Cheyenne, late to-night when train 57,
| westbound, was buried by a rock
[ slide at the west approach of the tun
net.
Engineer Charles Nelson, Fireman
Frank Hook and Head Brakeman Wil
liam Irvine, all of Laramle, Wyo., are
buried under the rock, earth, locomo
tive and cars. The lonjf tunnel Is
choked with derailed and telescoped
cars and portions of the mountain have
caved in.
Wrecking: trains with large numbers
of laborers were rushed to the scene
from Laramie and Kawlins and heroic
work Is being done at both ends of the
tunnel. Instructions have been issued
to hold all eastbound trains at Raw
! lins and westbound trains at Cheyenne
I and Laramie for at least twenty-four
hours, and it may be many days be
fore trains can pass through the tun
nel.
It is impossible to build a temporary
track around the wreck, for the tunnel
cuts a email mountain, but passengers,
exprees and mall probably will be
taken over the hill.

there is likely to be an advancement
all along the line except as to the
grand secretary. Charles H. Turner,
and the treasurer, John E. McDoug

all probability be retained, inasmuch

Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, April 22.â Laura Bur
ton, a young woman, who had been
for four years head waitress at the
Yosemite Hotel, died this morning at
St. Joseph's Hospital, three days after
taking bichloride of mercury with
self-confessed suicidal intent. When
she was taken to the hospital H was
not known from what Miss Barton
was suffering. Her case so perplexed
the attending physician that he de
manded to know of her what she had
' taken. She refused to tell him until
he threatened to operate on her. She
is said to have then told the physician
that she had taken bichloride of mer
; cury while despondent over a love af
| fair. She sought a promise of secrecy
: from him, bvi* under the circum
: stances he could not keep the in
formation to himself. The case was,
however, kept quiet until after her
1 death.
The father of the deceased, who
lives ln Shasta County, arrived here
after his daughter's death.

DE ROTHSCHILD
FAMOt'S BANKI7R WHOSE ENTER
TAINMENTS ARE AMONG THE
FEATIREf OF A LONDON SEA-
bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 22.â Alfred Charles
de Rothschild Is one of those men who
have solved the problem of how to be
happy though unmarried. Few people
seem to get more enjoyment out of life
than he. Possessed of a great fortune
â  rjtertainments are among the fea
tures of the Liondon seaaon. and those
about to begin at his town house in
Seamore Place are arousing the most
agreeable anticipation*. There is no
more poular host in Mayfair. And as
he contributes so much to its enjoy
ment society has long forgiven him for
neglecting bo take unto himself a wife.
U the examples set by his elder
brother. Lord Rothschild, and his
younger one. Leopold.
"Mr. Alfred.'" as he is universally
; is sixty-one years old. a dapper
little man and the most exquisitely at
tired member of XJhe Rothschild clan.
Like all of them ne is an astute man
of business. He is also a distinguished
amateur musician, a connoisseur in art
and a dilettante in many things. With
an income that works out a little
more than JJ> a minute, he has relaxed
none of hit practical interest in the
great financial operations for which
the hous* is famous. He is generally
at his office by ten every morning, re
maining there with an interval for
luncheon until this afternon.
POPULAR WITH ROYALTY.
When not occupying his town resi
dence, or detained by some social en
gagement, the financier travels every
evening in his own private railway tar
!<â¢ Hait<>n House, his magnificent coun
try seat near Tring. He is generally
accompanied by his private band, one
of his secretaries and a touple of
valets. The band, which is= composed
rst class musicians. jx^rforms
every night after dinner. Mr. Alfred in
variably conducting and pieces o f hit
imposition often being played.
â¢ 'onstitutionally delicate, with a
medical attendant always at hand, and
â dy nervous about his own health,
â¢nusements are always more or
!<=â ?<= of a sedentary nature. Of medium
height and slight build, his most re
markable physical characteristics are
r.spicuously small feet, which
are always, of course, beautifully shod.
A link autocratic, and apt to candidly
evtaec his disapproval of anything
that offends his artistic eye. he has
sometimes created a small sensation
jddenly demanding the removal
?audy bunch of fiowers from the
--hnlp of some astonished railway
r or other minor official whom he
has encountered in his frequent Jour
n*yingÂ« to and from town. He is dts
a 'Persona grata" with royalty
and i â¢ i grand dames, 'and his
iarttjr is not lessened by his readi
mst t' subscribe generously to the
raii'iMa 1 charities with which the
â *or.<i that amuses itself essays to
its multitude of sins.
I Â»\N N PRIVATE CIRCTS.
Halt on H'use is one of the most ex
â¢ museums in England.
It is built in th*> style of a French
chateau and the rooms and broad cor
ridors are adorned with French. Dutch
and Knglish paintings by the best
master* As for mere .curiosities, as
distinct from works of art. Mr. Alfred
has hundreds of them. The most
conspicuous of them is a circus -the
private circus in England. It Is
about a hundred yards in diameter,
palinged off and surrounded by trees.
In the winter it is covered by an enor
mous tent At one side, embowered
among the trees, stands the royal box.
a rustle building in keeping with the
surroundings. Inside, however, are
seats and settees which are the finest
products of modern upholstery. Be
hind It is the dressing room, which,
from the outside looks like a rustic
cottaire with its thatched roof, but
within It contains all the up-to-date
accessories of the ring, where Mr. Al
fred's guests are entertained by per
forming monkeys, ponies, dogs, gazelles
and trained tumblers and acrobats.
Another curiosity seen in the chalet,
which â¢erve* as a green room, ie a
marveloua clock, made like a tree,
which playe tunes, sets silver birds
f ying through the branches and a riv
of water flowing.

TO SEE HER BEHIND BARS
"Nan" Patterson Sends Word to
"Mamma" to Please Stay at
Home.
NEW YORK. April 22. â Nan Pat
terson herself to-day probably pre
vented what might have led to one of
the most pathetic of the many scenes
that have attended her incarceration
in the Tombs and her appearances in
court since she was charged with the
murder of Caesar Young, nearly a
year ago. Wh â her father called
upon her at the prison to-day he an
nounced that her mother was think
ing of coming here from Washington
to be present at the trial Monday.
"I'll never consent to have mamma
come here and see me behind prison
bars and in the courtroom on trial for
murder." she told her father. "I
hope you will induce her to stay in
Washington. She couldn't help me by
coming here and the trial might upset
her dreadfully. Please tell her to stay
at home."
Miss Patterson's father c"Â«Â»- "â 
Washington to-night to spend Sun
day with his family there.

HAR WRITTEN' A BOOK OF FOREST IDYLS THAT HAS ATTRACTED ' THE
KAVORAfttH ATTENTION OF CONTINENTAL REVIEWERS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN". April 22. â Princess Feo
dora of Schleswig-Holstein, the young
est sister of the German Empress, has
done her share to prove the falsity of
the theory that royal blood is synony
mous with intellectual mediocrity.
Her book of forest idyls, published un
i der the pseudonym of F. Hugin, with
j the title of "Der Wald" ("The For
| est"), has attracted the favorable at
â  tention of Continental reviewers, who
have welcomed her Royal Highness
! as a real addition to the thinned ranks
of writers of nature and romanticism.
The seal of approval was placed
! upon "Der Wald" by no less august
; and severe a critic than her own
brother-in-law, the German Kaiser,
who makes and unmakes literary
reputations by his praise or condem
nation, at least as far as quick fame
in Germany is concerned. When "Der
Wald" was brought out in Germany a
few months ago the Kaiser ordered
the German publisher to print a limit
ed edition de luxe on handsome vellum
paper, with binding of moss-green
chamois. The "de luxe" books, with
the title printed in silver bold relief
on the outside cover, were distributed
with his Majesty's compliments to
most of the Kings, Queens and other
royalties of Europe. The Kaiser ac
icmpi.nied each book with a personal
I assurance that he was extremely proud
jof his gifted sister-in-law's literary
; genius, and made the gift, so he is on
! record as saying, because of its merit
j and not for "family reasons."
"The Forest" is illustrated by its
j authoress' own pen, being replete with
: pictures descriptive of the still life
J which she has attempted to idealize.
; The book consists of four forest "fairy
; tales," which display great originality
MOROS UNDER REFUGEE
DATTO ATTACK WALLED CITY
Vicious Gang Fires Into Officers' Club
and Disperses Attendants
at Ball.
MANILA, April 22. â The walled
city of Jolo was attacked by Moros on
April 9. They fired into the Officers'
Club and dispersed those present at
a ball which was in progress. On
April 10 the secretary of Governor
Scott was ambushed and killed within
range of the sentries.
A datto refugee from Borneo has
organized the Moros, who are defy
ing the Americans. General Leonard
Wood has arrived at Jolo from Zam
branjra and given the Moros ten days
within which to surrender the refu
gee datto. If this is not done he will
concentrate a sufficient force to secure
a compliance with his demand.

NEW YORK, April 22. â Mm. Clar

Intention of becoming a candidate for

Garfleld on Way to Coast.
DENVER, April 22. â Oil Commis

f>f conception,^ A ripe artistic under
standing spealcs from the pictures in
which the entire poesy of the beech
woods, the magical charm of the fir
trees and the mysterious stirring of
the pine forests, haunted as they are
with legendary forms, is reproduced
in a masterly and entertaining way.
"Those who come under the spell of
this fascinating book, in which the
pen as well as the pencil have been
guided by the same artistic hand."
says a Berlin reviewer, "will learn with
astonishment that a German Princess
has concealed her identity behind the
norn de plume."
The Princess Feodora was born at
Primkenau, the ancestral home of the
Schleswig-Holstein grand ducal fam
ily, in 187 4 and is the youngest of four
sisters. The eldest sister is the Kai
ser's wife and another sister is the
wife of Prince Frederick Leopold of
Prussia, who is now representing Em
peror William with the Russian army
in Manchuria. Princess Feodora,
since childhood, has been of an ex
ceptionally studious and reserved
temperament, caring little for the joys
of society and the glittering attrac
tions of royal courts. She is much in
Berlin, however, and a favorite at the
functions of the Kaiser, who is gen

This is not reading mat-
ter. It is an advertisement,
pure and simple. There-
for* 1 read it. <
It is a fair assumption
thnt three out "f four house-
keepers ostensibly use Mocha
and Java Coffee in their
households. We use the
word "ostensibly" advisedly.
It Is a fact well known to
dealers that there is practi-
cally neither M<Â»jha nor Java
coffee in the market, and
that under these deslgma-
tions the public are buying
ar.d drinking what is neither
more nor less than various
growths of Central and i
South American coffee. But I "
what of that! say you. "It 111 1
euitÃ our palate, and that is i i
the main question." l
True for you â but if an ] '
article is found, not foisted : i
on you under an assumed
name, but one that is not
ashamed of Its nativity, and t i
is a credit to the island In j ,
v.'hich it Is . ira and i ,
which, if you â¢â¢ lid try It,
you would by far prefer to j 1
the other, we assume you j i
are willing to have the bene- .
fit of "t i ,
Ponce de Leon is not ! '
Mocha and Java; It is genu- I i
mc Porto Rico Coffee. j |
r grown under the American ;
fiag. We claim it to be the
best in the world. â¢ Why not ! i
spend forty cents, this is not 111 1
much monfy. and learn if ] j
our claim is well founded. ;
If you are paying only 35c '
a pound for so-called Mocha i
and Java, the additional cost j j
of 5c a pound should not in- ; '
fluence you; it will mean legs '
than onÂ« I dollar annually s
additional per head. i

ROME IS SORRY
TO LOSE MEYER
AMERICAN EMBASSADOR WELL LIKED
Success of the Yankee Diplomat in Every
Circle Astonishes the italians.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME, April ll.â the American
Embassador at St Petersburg, George
yon Legerke Meyer, will occupy a
much more difficult position than' that
which he has so successfully filled
here. Russia is the land of trouble
and at any time the American repre
sentative there may be required to
engragre in negotiations necessitating
the highest diplomatic skill to bring
them to a successful issue. That Mey
er will prove eciual to whatever de
mands are made upon his talents and
tact is the opinion of all who are fa
miliar with his career here. But Ro
man society regrets his departure.
His transference from the diplomat
ic calm of the Eternal City to the
stormy Russian <;iyital is regarded
here as a well merited recognition of
his fitness for the post. He came here
with a reputation as a shrewd busi
ness man who knows how to make
money, which is not regarded us a
special recommendation in aristocrat
ic Italian circles with Old World no
tions of the vulgarity of trade. Now
many of these same aristocrats are
wondering what are the peculiar con
ditions of American commercial life
which enable a man like Meyer, while
accumulating a fortune, to acquire
culture, courtesy, dignity, charm of
manner â in short, all those evidences
of good breeding which are supposed
to be the peculiar heritage of people
of exalted hereditary rank.
Of course, money counts for much
with an American Embassador, who
is expected to spend a deal more
money than Uncle Sam pays him in
maintaining the dignity of his posi
tion. But lacking other qualifications,
among a people so peculiarly sensitive
as the Italians, the command of wealth
would only serve to advertise an
American Embassador's unfitness for
the role undertaken by him. How
well Meyer has made money serve the
higher purposes of his mission may
be inferred from the fact that for five
years his home has been the center of
American life in Rome and the most
popular house In diplomatic and fash
ionable circles. Italians love beauty
and charm. Meyer has the latter in
an unusual degree, and Mrs. Meyer
the former; her magnificent figure and
golden hair making her one of the
most noticeable persons in any room
which she enters.
FRIENDS OF ROYALTY.
The King and Queen, already favor
ably disposed toward Americans, were
not long in discovering after Mr. and
Mrs. Meyer had established themselves
at the Palazzo Brancaccio that a new
element in the amity of nations and
the enjoyment of society had appeared
and showed them so many signs of fa
vor as almost to arouse jealousies.
"Those Americans have everything,"
I heard one old Embassador sigh â
by the way. his wife was nored for
her unamiability â "not only have they
money, a way with them and wit, but
beautiful wives into the bargain."
An<i thus the Meyer family went from

success to success, in the meantime
"bringing out" their two daughters,
who are only a little less popular than
their parents.
The embassy quarters in Rome are
very modest, consisting of a suite of
four rooms, comfortably furnished in
walnut and something: green, heated
comfortably and having: an atmos
phere of opulent activity thoroughly
American. One of the Ministers of
the late Cabinet said to me one day,
have never been in the United
States, but I know exactly what it is
like; the American embassy is a lit
tle bit of that interesting country
transported into our ancient Rome."
If the embassy is American, the Amer
ican representative's home in the
Palazzo Brancaccio is Italian, pure
and simple. "When in Rome, do as
the Romans do," has been taken to
heart by Meyer, with the result that
his quarters are In a palace of the
best type, which moreover is owned
by an American.
The Princess Brancaccio was a Miss
Field of New York, and, finding her
husband's heirlooms and uriceless
antique treasures scattered about in
various places, she gathered them all
together and brought them to Rome.
Meyer leased the immense first floor
of her palace, which communicates
with the most beautiful garden in
Rome. The staircase is regal in its
splendid simplicity, being a sweep of
easy steps in white marble, with a
couple of turns, and carpeted in red.
The walls are hung with ' priceless
antique tapestries.
LIVE IN PALACE.
A detailed description of all the
rooms would be impossible, but they
are adapted to all tastes and range
from a cozy boudoir, which makes one
think of scented cigarettes, a conser
vatory, ballroom, study, and sitting
room to dining, breakfast, reception
and ante rooms. Meyer's study is a
snug room with the walls hung in red
brocade and the chairs in red leather,
having a distinctive Italian character
given it by the ornate doors and wood
work, the foreign bibelots and antique
mirrors, which contrast oddly with
the modern photograph frames and
pretty accumulations of expensive
"necessaries" from Paris and New
York. The closed doors in the picture
open on a balcony with a lovÂ«Â»1y view
of Santa Maria Maggoire on ono hand.
Si. John L,ateran on the other and in
front the famous Sabine Hills in win
ter crowned with snow.
Mrs. Meyer's sitting-room gives an
idea of gayety. The ceiling and frieze
are in white, with lovely bas-reliefs,
the walls are hung in white and blue
?ilk, each of the four sides relieved
by priceless tapestry or pictures set
into the walls; besides this the chairs
are comfortable, cushions abound,
rarpets are thick and the electric light
is shaded. Two tables are literally
covered with photographs of Mrs.
Meyers friends in pretty frames,
which, in fact, overflow to the other
tables and the piano, while one sees
that much thought and ingenuity have
been expended on the selection of the
frames.
Mr. Meyer is known to the general
public principally through his invari
able presence at the fox hunt, and the
frequency with which he appears in his
red 24-horse power motor-car, which
bears him about the streets swiftly
and safely, which is due to his pru
deivce quite as -much as to the skill of
his chauffeur. This same motor-car,
together with the language which is
hi.Â«=, are amongr the links which bind
him to the friendship of the King.
BREAKS ITALY'S LAWS.
Victor Emmanuel loves the English
tongue and he loves sport. He has
often invited Meyer to fake a seat In
the royal automobile, while his Maj
esty has two or three times accepted
a seat in his turn in Meyer's car, its
owner being at the helm. Meyer dis
plays no nervousness on these occa
sions, but his chauffeur has confessed
that he was glad not to be in his
master's shoes. On one of these trips
the Embassador was an Involuntary
law-breaker, having to give way to
force majeure. They startedâ a most
imposing sight, the big red automobile
surrounded by the King's four bicy
clists and followed by other cars with
the King's aids and a gentleman of the
household â well within the speed limit,
but the Embassador was soon aware
that something was wrong, his royal
companion not seeming quite happy.
However, etiquette did not permit of
his asking questions and he cudgeled
his brains for the reasons in silence.
Presently his Majesty said, "What do
you say to taking advantage of "this
magnificent stretch of road?" The
Embaasador replied that they were
only just within the speed limit, and
that the bicyclists were already hav
ing all they could do to keep up.
"The bicyclists!" echoed the King, as
though he had never heard of them
before, "Oh! they must look out for
themselves." "But I thought they
were here to look out for your Maj
esty," ventured Meyer. "This is a bet
ter guard," was the reply, as the King
put his hand In his pocket and drew
out a deadly looking small revolver;
"this I know how to use, and will, too,
if the necessity arises."
That was quite enough. Meyer after
that cheerfully broke the laws of Italy
in the company of the King of that
country, arriving at the royal hunting
lodge half an hour quicker than Victor

Emmanuel had ever done before. On the
way back the King said gravely, "Mr.
Meyer, you have broken the laws of
my kingdom; it is my duty to. have
you denounced to the police; this will
give rise to a diplomatic incident and
you will be recalled." The Embassa
dor almost lost control of the machine
he was so startled, but a twinkle in
Victor Emmanuel's eye was sufficient,
FOND OF THE HUNT.
In the hunting field, which in Rome
is stiff to the last degree, Meyer di
vides the honors with M. Barrere, the
French Embassador. They always fol
low the hounds, but the latter is alone,
while Meyer is usually accompanied by
his two daughters^ who are as much
at home on horseback as their father,
which Is saying a great deal.
Meyer has one son, a lad of about
fifteen, who is seldom seen as he Is
busy with his studies, but he looks
like his father and bids fair to be a
fine specimen of the real American
man, with all the advantages which
living abroad gives, chiefly that of
speaking fluently several languages.
For the exercise of his talents as a
diplomatist, Meyer has found scant op
portunities during his tenure of the
embassy, as Italy has been at peace
with the world and his services have
not been required in any grave ques
tion between her and the United
States. However, the tact, ability and
dignity he displayed will be remem
bered when some American naval of
ficers, having been arrested in Venice,
he succeeded in satisfactorily settling
the whole affair. That would not have
been so easy a task had he not .been
persona grata with the Government
and the King.
King Victor Emmanuel has few fav
orites among foreigners, but that he
likes Mever there can be no doubt. He
has repeatedly expressed his regret that
he is going. _

of clay, taken without the permission
of the owner or agent, cost Morris
Splritas, John Griffin and Edward
Rule a totÂ»l of $60 In fines and costs
in Justice Anglin's court at Belleville.
The dirt belonged on a lot which is
the property of Rear Admiral Louis
Kempff of the United States navy, who

MORE PRISONERS THAN
SOLDIERS AT ARMY POST
Strange State of Affairs Exists on
Governor's Island Near
New York.
NEW YORK. April 22. â Army pris
oners now exceed by more than 100
the soldiers on duty at the post on
Governor's Island. Many of those
confined are merely under sentence
for desertion.
Military prisoners from all the posts
in the Department of the East are
confined in Castle William. Lately
the prison of the Department of the
Lakes at Chicago became so crowded
that many western prisoners have
been sent here. This accounts for
the curious state of affairs noted. In

â  â  TO THE PUBLIC: . - â  J
|a The Tonopah Home Consolidated Mines & Exploration Co. is organized for the purpose of taking over and consolidating and developing several of the close-in and most promising of the properties in Tonopah and adjoin- I 2
â¡ g ing and adjacent to the developed properties. * â  , , ' , - ' â  B
In this district, now only about 4 years old, over $150,000,000 has been developed and is now being extracted. New discoveries are constantly being made and the area in which these large and very rich ledges are being dis- 5 Â«
flg covered is constantly being widened and extended: important discoveries have recently been made, which, render extremely valuably the area now controlled by this company, and as well as that in which it is proposed to operate â Â«
gn under this consolidation. In addition it has been decided to add the feature of an exploration company to examine, prospect, develop and take over other properties in Tonopah, Goldfield, Bullfrog, Silver Peak and other districts, â  *
>â  and the advantages of combining this feature are that: . . - Hg
ga In the selection and acquisition of mining property the company commands, first, its own engineering talent, and, second, may select from. work of a great army 01* prospectors! The latter are always presenting their dis- "" :
B â  coveries to those whom they believe will undertake development. Out of such a condition, aside from the active work of those directly in the employ of the company, the. good from the bad can be segregated. The earliest and â  1
g B often the best discoveries in a district thus pass into the hands of our examining engineers. Later discoveries in older districts will likewise be brought into touch' with us more easily and promptly than where there is an absence ! a
qB of a source known to the prospector through which he can negotiate a bond or sale. . : . . â  a
HE3 Heretofore the large investor and the Exploration Companies have curiously enough devoted themselves to a search for "going concerns." "Going concerns" of merit are seldom for sale at a commensurate price. If they are ac- S â 
gO quired it is usually at a price so high that over-capitalization must follow with meager and uninviting dividends. It is not unusual that the end of the dividend period has been reached long before there has been a return of the 5 3
â Â§ original capital and the interest on the money which it should logically earn. ./ r . \. â  a
ga Realizing that these facts have in the past too often operated disastrously to many worthy but misdirected concerns the Tonopah Home Cons. M, &. E. Company will seek to acquire and take over properties in their early de- I â 
3 Â° velopment. Whatever fruits may accrue out of such properties the company will enjoy in the fullest measure, riot only in the production of ores, but. in the enhanced values arising out of actual development. The latter is often the lar- â  5
g I gest empirical asset which a "going concern" has to offer when it is for sale. Moreover, in the early stages of development, before any considerable amounts of money have been spent, the earmarks of promise or failure pretty e n- m m
HE I erally manifest then. selves. It is therefore possible to forestall a large outlay which in the end may become a. total, loss, and at a time when we have spent only such reasonable sums as the property or properties actually or 'rea- â  g
â h Bonably warrant: not in the light of prospective or speculative value, but in the light of substantial and definite merit. ; > * " Â«28Â« 28
U g The remarkable discoveries made within the past two or three years in Western and Southwestern Nevada, embracing such districts as Tonopah. Goldfield, Bullfrog, Kawick, Lida, et al. call attention conspicuously to â  a
g B the opportunities for organized talent and capital prepared to operate in those districts. Notwithstanding the lack of capital many splendid fortunes have been made. Â£>f> | a
bS In nearly every instance those fortunes have been made at an astounding premium. Thus only have the very high grade ores been shipped at costs ranging from $20.00 to $40.00 per ton. Had ample capital been in hand "5
g M at the beginnig nearly the whole of the values could have been converted to the profit of the owners", instead of to transportation, reduction and other companies. Such a condition as this presupposes only exceptionally high orade h Â»
â  â  ores - while those of lower value either remain un worked altogether or are handled at a heavy disadvantage. A large proportion of mining, dividends are derived not from bonanza ores, but from those of 'medium or even low value 8g
R g and the paving and going concerns of to-day are ones in which ample capital is in hand to make a success wherein for the lack of capital failure would follow. -This' is peculiarly true of all industrials* and is conspicuously true M â 
HIH I of mining. With these facts in view, it is considered that the Tonopah Home Consolidated Mines & Exploration Co. is in an excellent position, and, operating as it is in such a wonderfully rich section, that early and large divi- Si

REDDING, April 22. â Thomas Cal
lac. a miner, employed at the After
thought mine, walked out of an open
doorway on the second floor of the
Cooney lodging-housp at Ingot while
asleep this morning and awoke when
he struck the ground, a distance of
thirty feet. Callac struck on his feet,
and. strange to say, the only injury he
sustained was a slight bruise on the
big toe of his left foot.
Callac slept soundly and some
where along about midnight arose
from his bed and walked to the open
door. The building is just being fin
ished and a ladder is used as a tem
porary stairway. This particular
night, however, the ladder was not in
place and Callac walked straight ahead
into space. He fell to the ground and
awoke. He was considerably surprised
to lind himself out of bed ami more
â O when he found he was out of the
building. He did not know what had
happened. He only knew that every
muscle in his body was stiff. Callac
then went back into the house and
went to bed again after lock'ng the
door so that he would not be able to
walk out again.

MILAN SUICIDE
TRAGIC AFFAIR
MILAN. April 22. â The suicide of
beautiful Marchioness Maria Palla
vicini, Viscountess of Trent, Austria,
yesterday at the famous cathedral dur
ing the Good Friday services cast a
gloom over the city.
The Marchioness was renowned
throughout Italy for her great beauty.
She was not yet thirty ye.ars of age.
Domestic unhappiness following sepa
ration from her husband is supposed
to have been the cause of her suicide.
The Good Friday services in the
Duomo are renowned throughout the
world, and are second only to those
of Rome. The procession of the sta
tions of the cross had ended and thou
sands in the cathedral knelt in silence
about, the crucifix. There was no sound
throughout the great church except
that made by the breathing of the con
gregation. At this moment of most in
tense concentration the shot was heard
near the tomb of St. Charles Borromeo
in front of the altar. The tense silence
was shattered. Thousands of women
rose to their feet panic stricken by the"
scream which followed the shot. Only
those clustered near the tomb could
realize what had happened. On the
beautiful priedieu on which she had
been kneeling at prayer lay the March
ioness, blood streaming from the
wound in her forehead, while the
women near her screamed and fran
tically sought to get away from the
spot.
From the altar a priest forced his
way to her side and remained kneel
ing, administering the last rites of the
church. Other church officials hurried
about the cathedral urging the throng
to leave until the building had been
cleared, so that it could be consecrated
anew.

A Doctor's Tall: on 100 |
There are no fairer set of men on !
earth than the doctors, and when they I
find they have been in error they are !
usually apt to make honest and manly j
confession of the fact.
A case in point is that of an eminent i
practitioner, one of the good old school, J
who livÂ«a in Texas. HiÂ« plain, unvar- i
nished tale needs no dressing up: i
"I had always had an intense preju-
dice, which I can now see was unwar-
rantable and unreasonable, against all '
muchly advertised foods. Hence. I '
never read a line of the many 'ads.' of ,
(.; rape-Nuts, nor tc-Bted the food, till I
last winter.
â¢â¢While in Corpus Christi for my
bca^th. and .visiting my youngest son,
who has four of the ruddiest, health-
iest little boys lever saw. I ate my]
first dish of Grape-Nuts food for sup- !
per with my little grandsons. I became !
exceedingly fond of it and have eaten I
a package of it every week since, and i
find it a delicious, refreshing and
strengthening food, leaving no 111 ef- !
fects whatever, causing no eructations J
i with which I was formerly much J
troubled), no sense of fullness, nausea ,
nor distress of stomach In any way. j
"There is no other food that, agrees ,
with roe so well, or sits bo lightly or
pleasantly on ray stomach as this does. â 
I am stronger and more active since I :
began the use of Grape-Nuts than I
have .fceen far. , 10 years, and am no
longer troubled with nausea and mdi- j
gestion." Name given by Postum Co.,

DEATH STRAXGELY BUSY
ABOUT OMAHA COURTHOUSE
OMAHA, April 22. â Death has been
strangely busy about the courthouse
during the last few weeks. First the
mothers of County Commissioner Mc-
Donald and Chairman Kennard of the
County Board died, the one in Oma
ha and the other in Toledo, Ohio.
Then a juror named Graves was taken

of the mother of Clerk of Court
Broadwell. in New York State. Judge
Howard Kennedy lost his father early
in the week. Word came that the wife
of County Treasurer Fink was dead

prominent character In local politics
was killed by being struck by a street
car.
STAR IS TAKEN
FROM SPECIAL
Special Policeman Swift of the Bel
vedere was deprived of his pistol and
star early yesterday morning by Pa
trolman Sam Orr for assaulting Captain
Sullivan of Engine Company No. 12.
Swift will have to answer to the Police
Commissioners for his conduct.
According to Sullivan, he and the
other members of his company were in
the engine house on O'Farrel street,
near Grant avenue, having left their
own quarters on account of a second
alarm for a fire on Market street.
While waitinc for the men whu oc
cupy the O'Farrell street engine housÂ«
to return Swift entered the place in
full uniform and proceeded to unroll
the tape, which registers the different
alarms of fire. Sullivan ordered him
to desist, whereupon Swift, so the fire
captain states, struck him in the face.
Policeman Orr, who was passing at the
time, promptly seized Swift and. after
hearing Sullivan's story of the assault,
deprived the special of his star and
pistol. Orr made a written report of
the occurrence to Chief Dinan, who,
after an investigation, ordered charges
to be preferred against Swift with the
Police Commissioners.
Swift defends his attack on Sullivan
by saying that he walked into the en
gine house to ascertain where the are
was, when Sullivan ordered him out.
Thinking that he had a right to know
he claims he refused to leave, when
Sullivan attempted to eject him. It
was then that he struck the captain.

Waterproofing Fine Dress Good*.
One of the most important pro-
cesses now used for waterproofing
dress materials is on the lines of the
old alumina process. In this case the
factor used Is resin, dissolved in a
large bulk of petroleum spirit. ThÂ«
fabrics to be proofed axe passed
through a bath of this solution and
dried to drive off the solvent. Fol
lowing this, the goods are treated by
pressing with hot polished metal roll

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
THROWS LIGHT
ON NEW ORDER
University Authorities' Bul
letin Explains Import of
UK Army Instructions
REVELATIOS IS MADE
Military Officer Need No
Longer Act as Reporter
for Washington Bureau
BERKELEY. April 22.â The new
order from the War Department, af
g the military instruction and
drill of students at such universities
ac that of California, is much more im
portant and significant, according to
the university authorities hare, than
appeared when the announcement was
first made of its provisions.
A statement was issued to-day from
President Wheelers offlce, explaining
the new order and giving details of its
contents, revealing what not many
people have known hitherto, viz., that
in Nance or any other military
â¢nstructor stationed at the university
has been expected to report to the War
) Apartment whether the university
authorities â¢'condoned in any degree in
subordination or disregard of discipline
on the j-an of students undergoing
military instruction" and if this was
the care the military instructor was
make a report unfavorable
university 'regardless of all
other considerations.' 1
It is now seen that the university
authorities were obliged to discipline
the students concerned in the riot on
the campus last >ear. when Captain
Name's orders were practically defied,
. fTer the inconvenience of having
Nan 1"'1 "' report the facts to the War De
partment.
Regarding this feature of the old or
(ie:-. which now is so changed that such
: s from military Instructors are
not required, the announcement from
President Wheeler's office made to-day
fa ye
"An important afneadment of the
general orders applies to section 8 of
those orders, which at present reads
as follows â¢â¢Â»â¢â â  ;
I M P< >RT AXT AM EX DM KN T.
"When application is made for the
detail of an officer of the army at an
institution to which an officer had not
theretofore been assigned, it shall be
d by an inspector or other suit
able officer, wh'i. after explaining to
the president and the faculty the re
quirements of these regulations, shall
satisfy himself as to the intention and
ability of the school authorities to com
ply with them, and whether the gen
eral sentiment of the faculty is cordi
ally in favor of military instruction as
herein required. It will be especially
Moertmlned and reported whether the
rt authorities will refuse to grad
uate any student who has shown in the
military department a spirit of insub
ordination or habitual disregard of
, iine Tht inspector shall then re
port to the War Department whether
such a detail should be made. ' As
amended, it will read; â¢
When application is made for the
of an officer of the army at an
institution to which an officer had not
theretofore been assigned, it shall be
visited by an inspector or other suit
able officer, who shall report to the
War Department whether such detail
should be made.
Furthermore, section 9 has been
amended by the omission of the re
quirement that officers detailed as pro
's at the colleges shall report as
to the exact compliance by the school
*uthorities with these requirements of
the regulations.' and also by the omis
sion of the statement that if the report
of the annual inspecting officer "is ad
verse th-? professor uf military science
and tactics shall be withdrawn,' and
also ol the statement, 'if the college
authorities condone in any degree a
spirit of insubordination or disregard
of discipline on the part of students
undergoing military instruction, an ad
verse report will be made, regardless
other considerations.'
Thesr- changes are self-explanatory
their purpose. It If evident that
the old orders were calculated to maka
ih<> military department in imperio,
the detailed officer being placed in the
unfortunate position of being respon
sible to two sources of authority. He
Â« as even instructed to keep watch
upon the institution of which he was
constituted a member, and report to
an outside authority concerning its de
relictions. Thi? was evidently an im
possible situation prolific of misunder
ttandinffs. Th* amended orders will
be evidently of very great profit to the
military departments of the colleges,
Q h& to the colleges themselves."
SIGNIFICANCE IS SEEN.
The slarmrtranee of other amendments
to the old order of the Wr.r Deptart
inent relating to military instruction in
â  further explained by the
university authorities' announcement
In the follow <r.g words:

QUARREL OVER
MOTHER'S CARE
Sudden Rise in Property
Value Set Children War

MATTERS ARE ADJUSTED
Custody of Mrs. M. Boreland
Goes to Daughter While
Son (ares for the Realty
OAKLAND. April 22â A squabble
between the three children of Mrs.
Margaret Boreland as to who should
have the charge of their mother's per
son and estate was the cause of a
clash in the courts this morning. Her
estate consists of property located on
Twenty-first street, between Myrtle
and Filbert, which the recent jump of
realty In that portion of the city has
raised from a valuation of $6000 to
three or four times that amount.
In order to do juutice to all. Judge
Ogden ordered that the mother be
placed in the care of Mrs. Lulu Van
derwerker. her daughter, and the care
of the property given to James Bore
land, the eldAt son. Alexander Bore
land and Mrs. Vanderwerker have
been ordered to deed back to their
mother one lot owned by her which
she gave them recently, as It was not
believed she waa competent when she
n:ade the deed. According to this
brother and the ElPter. the whole trou
ble arose through the elder brother
rf fusing to contribute anything to
ward the support of their mother and
she gave them this lot as a return for

which the recent rise in values made

EASTER HAT
AN INCENTIVE
TO DEVOTION
BY ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE.
1 'AKLAND. April 22. â If the sun
shines to-morrow â and present indi
cations are good â every woman who
is the blissful possessor of a new-
Easter "bonnet" will be seized with a
sudden accession of piety, and the
minister will rejoice accordingly, for
Easter Sunday is the one day in the
year when every church receives its
quota of attendants, and the contribu
tion box waxes heavy in the hands of
the collector. It is a question Just
how much the hat, that annually fur
nishes material for the joke maker,
is responsible for the crowds of Easter
worshipers, but I have known women
to remain away from church on that
day because of millinery reasons and
have known others to go purely and
simply because they were newly fitted
out with fashion s iatest in headgear.
But whatever motive impels woman
to devotion on Easter morn, she forms
part of a brilliant, beautiful picture
that is none the less solemn because
of the flowers and gay ribbons that
bedeck bended heads.
With the day of resurrection comes
also surcease of even the pretense of
penitence, when one doesn't have to
be gay in an "informal" manner, but
may take one's pleasure ostentatiously.
During the past week cards to every
kind of entertainment have been ac
cumulating, and the popular maid is
facing a strenuous: period. Teas,
luncheons, dinners, weddingsâ the list
is a formidable one.
Miss Lucretia Burnham will start
the social ball rolling on Monday even
ing with a dinner dance for Miss
Smith and Roland Oliver. There is
no lovelier residence in Oakland than
the lakeside home of the J. R. Burn
hams, and their /bonny daughter â
the only one â is an admirable hostess.
The dinner is to be an elaborate af
fair, covers to be laid for thirty-six
guests.
Miss Smi'.h will also be the honored
guest of two of Tuesday's most im
portant events â the luncheon Mrs. F.
C Havens is giving and a dinner at
the Dan Beldens in the evening.
The tea which Mrs. Percle Clay
Black is giving Tuesday for Miss An
nette King, the fiancee of Th?odore
Jenkins, the young tenor of St. John's
Church, in San Francisco, will be one
of the notable affairs of the week.
The Hyde-HRtha way wedding at St.
Paul's will be the event of Wednesday,
and on Thursday evening Trinity
studios ih*t at least three hours per
wvek for two years, or the. equivalent
thereof, shall be assigned for instruc
tion In the military department, not
less than two-thirds of the total time
to be devoted to practical drill, includ
ing- guard mounting and other military
ceremonies, and the remainder to theo
retical instruction.'
"The order of April 6, 1904, which the
aforesaid displaces, reads in part as
follows: 'At every institution of class
B there shall be allowed a minimum of
five nours, this time being occupied as
the professor of military science and
tactics may deem best.' It has been
the custom to hold drill two hours a
â week ./or the : lirst three years and to
require of the seniors attendance for
one hour a week upon, a course
of lectures on . military science.
For the remaining days of the
five in each ;" week guard mount-
Ing-, and , other . duties were re
quired of the students, each student
coming, In his proper turn. ..It. was: al
ways questionable whether this really
fulfilled the orders of the War ".De
partment. . Thy present order repre
sents something that" can be carried
out without evasion or forced con
struction. ' It will prove. in many, ways
a great advantage to the military de
partment of the university. A student
learns In two years as much ; about
ill ill as he can absorb, " the fact that
one who finds himself in r the third-year
of his course still a private loses the
zest which is essential to â  good work.
Year after year it turns out that it Is
a freshman - company; which takes I the
prize for the best appearance and drill.
"The concentration of the six re
quired hours, upon the first two years
will furthermore bring military de
partment Into accord- with the general
organization of the curriculum whereby
the required work^ is 'completed during
the flrst two years, ths last two being
left for/free election. Students- who
desire Ip tnke military work in the last
Jit two years, tho last their being
r free elation. Students who
to t*ke military work in the last
ars will take it by iheir own
free choice. It is presumable; that only
boss v. hi- l:avo been promoted to V oÂ£
â â¢ ficfrs' positions' will: so elect.' 1 -: 'v
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SIXPAV, APRIL 23, 1005. '
OBJECT TO TAX
ON ENGINEERS
University Students Hold In
dignation Meeting on the
Campus and Take Action
PROTEST TO BE MADE
Committee Appointed to Pre
pare Document tor Pre
sentation to President
BERKELEY. April 22.â Students in
the civil engineering courses at the 1
University of California held an indig- !
nation meeting this morning in the
mining bunding, on the campus, to pro- 1
test against the action of the regents
of the university in raising the fee
summer school surveyors must pay
from 15 to $10.
This fee is to pay for the wear and'
tear on instruments supplied the engi
neering students while in attendance 1
at the annual summer school of sur
veying, when the young engineers do
practical field work and in other ways '
derive practical benefit during the re
mainder of the college year from the '
theories that have been taught them.
Last year about HOC students attend
ed this summer school at Santa Cruz
and about the same number expected
to take the course this summer. The
action of the regents in raising the tax
from )5 to $10, however, is said to have
imperiled the success of the summer
school, and scores of students inti
mated to-day that they would "cut
out" the summer school rather than
pay the increased fee.
Professor E. N. Prouty explained to
the students at their indignation meet
ing the reasons that made the in
creased tax necessary. He told them
that the expense incurred in the use
of instruments always had been
greater than the fees taken from stu
dents represented, and that the uni
versity now is not in a position to re
peat this programme.
Despite Professor Prouty's explana
tion, the students decided to prepare a
formal protest for presentation to
President Wheeler and J. M. Burke and
H. R. Foster were appointed a com
mittee to draft and present the pro
test.
Church will be crowded with friends
of Dr. Bakewell and Miss McElrath.
A pretty and rather unusual feature
of the latter wedding will be the
bridesmaids, all five of them being
sisters of the bride. Dr. Bakewell's
brother will be his best man and his
father. Rev. John Bakewell, formerly
pastor of Trinity Church, will pro
nounce the nuptial benediction.
The wedding of Miss Hyde with
Lieutenant Hathaway promises to be
an unusually brililant affair. The ap
pointments will be of a military char
acter and the bridesmaids will all
wear yellow, the cavalry color. Mr.
Hathaway will be attended by brother
officers in uniform.
The church ceremony will be fol
lowed by a small reception at the res
idence of the bride's parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Marcus Hyde.
â¢ â¢ â¢
It begins to look as if everybody in
town would be at Reed Hall Tuesday
evening, when Miss Mabel Riegel
mann will make her appearance, at
once a debut and farewell, for short
ly after the young singer will leave for
Europe to begin a period of study un
der the patronage of Madame Gad
ski. Every one Is eager to hear the
sweet voice that roused such enthus
iasm in the great artist. What little
training Miss Riegelmann has had has
been good and her voice is well placed
and evenly poised, which, with her
natural sweetness and purity of tone,
means much for future success.
Not musicians only, but society is
interested in the coming concert and
the list of patronesses includes several
of Oakland's leaders. Mrs. Oscar
Luning. who has watched the young
singer's progress since she first began
to sing, heads the list, and associated
with her are Mrs. W. E. Sharon, Mrs.

Since the Edward F. Hugheses have
moved into their spacious and artis
tic home out on Vernon Heights they
have entertained several limes in
elaborate fashion, but none was more
pleasant than the reception given by
Mrs. Hughes yesterday for Miss Lucia

roses filled all available space and
made a pleasing background for the
dainty spring toilettes of the callers.

GRAVE CHARGE
BY CANDIDATE
Alleges Money Was Used to
Aid Thomas Kickard in
His Fight for Trustee
MAX BEATEN COMPLAINS
Is Having an Investigation
Made and May Decide
to Institute a Contest
BERKELEY, April 22.â Investigation
Is now bsing made by friends of John
Hinkel, a capitalist, who was a non
partisan candidate for Town Trustee
at the recent election, of charges that
money was improperly used to influ
ence university students in favor of
Thomas Rickard, the successful can
didate, and students changed their res
idence to stuff Rickard's ward.
Mr. Rickard has been president of
the Board of Town Trustees and his
title is that of "Mayor of Berkeley."
He defeated Hinkel by six votes and
was afterward re-elected president of
the Board of Trustees. Hinkel made
the following statement to-day:
"Friends of mine, whose names I
don't care to give out, have been col
lecting evidence to prove the truth of
stories about the improper use of mon
ey in the fight between Rickard and
myself. Those friends are to meet to
morrow afternoon and report to me the
result of their investigation. Then I
will decide whether to institute a con
test and make public the facts. We
know that a very large campaign fund
was used In the fight in my ward by
the Republican committee that man
aged Mr. Rickard's contest. How it
was spent, or who contributed it, is
what we are investigating. If stu
dents received money, as they are said
to have done, or changed their resi
dences improperly in order to vote for
Rickard, perhaps it will be best to
have the facts made public. I have
no quarrel with Rickard, however.
We are friends. The commltteemen
from that ward. I suppose, conducted
his fight, spent, the money and did the
work."
Rickard expressed himself as fol
lows:
"All the work done for me in the
election was fair, clean and above
board work. No money was used im
properly, nor were the other measures
used improper in any sense. I court
any investigation that can be made."
A. E. Shaw, Louis Titus and S. G.
Masters are the committeemen from
Uickard's ward. Each denied to-night
that any of the methods used to elect
Trustee Rickard were at all improper,
and all declared their willingness to
meet the non-partisan candidate's
men in an investigation.

RULES FOR GYMNASIUM
Students Will in Future Be
Permitted to Take Work
Under Progressive System
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April
22. â The Register, the Stanford cata
logue for the y-ar 1904-5, was dis
tributed from the registrar's office to
day. Various changes In announce
ments of the different departments are
made in this year's book. One of the
new courses which will be offered next
year is an introduction to philosophy
and will be given by Professor James
of Harvard.
The courses in the department of
hygiene have also been considerably
changed. The new system will enable
the student to take gymnasium work
for four years progressively without
being compelled to be in classes with
new men and go through work with
which he is already familiar. Two new
lecture courses will be given In this
department. They are to be given by
Dr. Snow and are catalogued as the
history of medicine and sanitary legis
lation.
Another important change is that
the entrance to the university will be
much harder, as the number of schools
and colleges whose graduates will be
received without examinations has
been greatly reduced, and more peo
ple will have to take the entrance ex^
animations in order to enter.
The summary of students shows a
total of 1568 students, against 1458
for 1903-4.
The number of special students
has decreased by twenty-five and the
number of graduate students by four
teen. There are 1188 students whose
residence is in California, against 1119
for the previous year.

San Francisco keeps abreast of the ]

scientists of world-wide reputation. In- !

Among the successful men of science
who have been attracted to San Francis- |
co by its many advantages is Dr. Furey,
the celebrated dermatologist, formerly of j
London and New York, who recently i
opened an elegant suite of offices at 359- |

demonstrations daily from 9 a. m. to 8 p. !
m.. and where he can be reached by tele-
phone (John 6541) to arrange engage-

' Dr. Furey has the distinction of being
the discoverer of the only remedy known
to science which will positively eradicate I
the worst cases of deep wrinkles from

By bis wonderful method Dr. Furey !
removes crow's feet and lines about the '
forehead and ears, restores drooping cor-1
ners of the mouth to natural poise,
builds up a poorly developed neck and
overcomes double chins. The nose, as
â well as other features, can also be. mold- ,
ed to ones satisfaction, making the face- â¢
clear, round and smooth. i
' All this rs done by developing or relax- â¢

Professional confidence forbids Dr. Fu-
rey using the names of his clients pub-

FISH DEALERS TTRX OVER
INDERWEIGHT STRJPED BASS
J>eputy Commissioners Throughout the
State Are Active in Arresting
Game I.Â«w Violators.
The action of the local fish dealers
in turning over to the Fish Commis
eior. two lots of underweight striped
bass is looked upon by Commissioner
Vogelsang as an evidence of good faith
in complying with the game laws.
Throughout the State the Deputy Fish
Commissioners are continually mak
ing arrests for various violations of the
law.
In Monterey Deputy Commissioner
Birks arrested Ah Sing for taking un
dersized abalones. Mendocino County
deputies are kept busy watching for
deer law pvasions. Deputy Ralph ar
d A. Swan for having a doe hide.
ase will be tried in Ukiah and the
minimum penalty is 150.
A number of small birds were
shipped to the San Francisco market
during the last week. It is against the
law to kill any but game birds in sea
son. ' English sparrows and a few of
the fiercer species of hawk. A. Kopta
of Corning was arrested by Deputy
Birmingham for having sturgeon in
hie possession. He wae fined $20.

Dr. Marten Is Writing.
Dr. Arthur Marten, recently released
from a commitment to a State asylum
for the insane by order of United
States Circuit Judge Morrow, is en
gaged in writing a book upon his ex
periences. He asserts that he was
"railroaded" into the asylum by
wicked persons, who procured a com
mitment from Superior Judge Belcher
on March 1, 1897. During his incar
ceration he wrote a letter to President
McKinley. dated March 17, 1901, com
plaining that he had been denied the
right of appeal to the courts. Judge
Morrow's order of release was based
upon the fact that Dr. Marten had
been released from custody.

I'HE SAM FRANCISCO CALL', SUNDAY, 'APRIL 25, 1905.
New Time Table To-Day.
To-day the Mount Tamalpais Railway
Company will increase the number of
Sunday trains Ijy three, making seven
trains on Sundays and legal holidays.
The weekday time is the same as hereto
fore.
The new arrangement affords ample
opportunity to adjust the trip to one's
convenience and will be a welcome
change.
The Tamalpais trip now ranks as one
of the world's great scenic rides, and for
beauty and extent of scenery and kaleid
oscopic changes is unrivaled.
There is no better time to enjoy the
ride than at this season, when the route
is entirely free from dust and the moun
tains and valleys everywhere present a
variety of greenery, restful and inspiring.
Forces Xamcs of Vouchers.
Edward Batholomew Brown filed an
application to take the civil service ex
amination for hoseman in the Fire De
partment and the names of Garret Mc-
Enerney and John D. Heise were
signed to his application as vouchers.
The poor handwriting caused the
Civil Service Commission to institute
an investigation, with the result that
it was ascertained that neither Heise
nor McEnerney had signed the paper.
Brown was about to be weighed in the
medical examination when he was
confronted with the deceit he had at
tempted to practice and his applica
tion was thrown out. Another ap
plicant, George W. Curran, could not
spell the name and did not know the
names of his vouchers and he, too,
will not be allowed to take the exami
nation.
TRAMPS STEAL HOSIERY
OF WADING MAIDS.
FLEETG PARK WITH PLUNDER
Victims Remain in Ocean and Scream Until
Policemen Recover Limb Garments.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Miss Nellie Bowman of 390 Jones
street told Police Judge Mosran that
never was she more embarrassed than
when she saw her shoes, stockings and
chatelaine purse picked up and carried
away from the spot where she had de
posited them ere she tucked ud her
skirts and went a-wading in the surf
that lapped the ocean beach near the
Cliff House. And her lady friend was
similarly affected, because she was
similarly situated. Their property was
in possession of two rough-lookinsr men
who were hastening toward the boule
vard with apparent intent to enter the
park and find concealment amid the
shrubbery. What could self-respecting
girls do in such a predicament? The
thieves were so far away that to pur
sue them would have been futile, even
if such pursuit could have been jfrace
fully conducted with bare feet. Nor
could the robbery be supinely submit
ted to, because there was no convenient
means of obtaining new shoes and
stockings, and to return to the city
without such foot-coverlnKS â mercy! it
couldn't be thought of!
"And what did you do that resulted
in the arrest of these defendants?" in
quired the Judge.
"We screamed," replied Miss Bow
man. "I thought of it first, and we
screamed together."
Patrolmen Dow and Harringrton he*ard
the screams of the ladies in the water
and hastened to their aid. imaerininc:
they were either in the grasp of the
undertow or in the clutches of vo
racious crabs, and when the true
situation was disclosed there beean a
chase that came to a finish when Ben
son Laverty, stunted and dark, and
Gustav Reldies, tall and blonde, were
captured as they plodded thrbugh the
park with the plunder in their hands.
The footgear and purses were restored
to their owners and the prisoners
booked for petty larceny.
"We were only joshin'," was the de
fense uttered by Mr. I^averty and in
dorsed-by Mr. Reldlee. The latter gen
tleman added that he considered the
alleged joke "a good -one on the srirls."
"You do, hey?" said his Honor. "Well,
as you had your joke on the girls yes
terday it's but fair that the girls should
have their joke on you to-day. 'Turn
about Is fair play," you know. You're
guilty as charged, and the girls are at
liberty to laugh if they so desire."
But the girls merely smiled.

Joseph R. Watson, grocer at 899 Capp
street, tried to gulp carbolic acid with
suicidal intent and his wife's arms

Tetrazzini, dellciously gowned,
cloaked and hatted and visibly quak
ing with court-fright, leaned heavily
upon the arm of "Vie" Demartini,
Italian interpreter, as he escorted her
from Judge Conlan's chambers to the
thronged tribunal, where, with fright
ened eyes she watched the face of the
magistrate while he voiced instruction
that she reappear before him at 11:30
o'clock to-morrow morning to aid the
people of the State of California in
their prosecution of her late financial
secretary, Julio Zlegner Uriburu, form
ally accused of embezzling 27,000 francs
which she had entrusted to his keep

"Ah, heaven," she tremblingly whis

to the million populi more gladly sing

The court had been informed that
the songbird might possibly spread her
pinions and fly to Mexico ere her testi

Impress her with the fact that such
flight would not be tolerated that his
Honor subjected her to the ordeal of
facing the bench. Signor Wanrell, who
is arranging the diva's Mexican tour,
stated he was hourly expecting a dis
patch that would determine the exact
time of her departure, and he, too, was
notified that her return to court to
morrow is imperative. Then the case
was continued in accordance with that
edict, and the Tetrazzini withdrew
through packed corridors and shrink
ingly ran the gauntlet of a double
battery of cameras as she quitted the
Hall of Justice.

Charles Cerelli, accused of disturb
ing the peace of a North End vaude
ville theater by placing his feet upon
the orchestra rail and thus impairing
the pianist's work, pleaded corns.
Several of his toes were aching, he In
formed Judge Mogan, as they always
did Just before a rainstorm broke
loose, and it was to ease them that he
utilized the orchestra rail for a foot
rest. Yes, he had tried chiropody,
but his corns grew almost as rapidly as
they could be extracted, and the pe
cuniary expense of having them regu
larly attended to by a scientist was
more than his limited income would
permit. No, there was no doubt of
their infallibility as forecasters of
rain. Indeed, that was their only re
deeming feature. Their timely warn
ing had saved him from many a
drenching. His attendance a*, the
theater the evening of his arrest was
the result of pedal notification that a
downpour was coming. His case was
continued one week.
Mrs. Jane Doe Bloomer of 630 Page
street, directed a stream from a gar
den hose against the person of H. C.
Root, furniture mover, while he was
plying his vocation in front of a
dwelling adjoining her own, but he
might have forgiven and ultimately
forgotten the aqueous assault if she
had not subsequently saturated In
similar manner a physician and a mail
carrier, neither of whom had offered
any provocation whatsoever. Then it
was that Mr. Root considered it his
duty. to the community at large to pro
tect it from possible deluging by the
lady, who seemed to have a penchant
for that sort of thing, and he accord
ingly caused issuance of a warrant for
her arrest. It was not so much the
waste of water as the spirit of malice
aiming the nozzle that provoked Mr.
Root to lawful reprisal. Mrs. Bloomer's
defense will be heard by Judge Conlan
to-morrow.
Slpnor Accusia Scofflno and his wife,
Jennie, berated each other in Italian
before Judge Fritz, and if they had
sung instead of shouted the scene
would have been strikingly suggestive
of a quarrel duet, such as Collamarlni
and Russo once upon a time regaled
Tivoli patrons with when the bill was
"Carmen." Signora Jennie shrilled
her complaint of battery and accom
panied the narration with pantomimic
gesture as expressive as her voice.
-j- â  -m-
When she pointed to her blackened
and bruiaed eye and pronounced it the
defendant's handiwork her tones
were most ferocious and her frame
was convulsed with passionate anger.
And as she talked with tongue, hands
and shoulders, so did Signor Accusia,
while the interpreter and two attor
neys versed in the vernacular vainly
tried to stem the double torrent With
fingers stuffed in ears the Judge stalk
ed his little platform and shouted,
"What are they saying? WHAT ARE
THEY SAYING?"
"She says he has another wife and
family in New York and she wants
nothing more to do with him," yelled
the interpreter. "He says she loves
another instead of him."
Just then Jennie said something
that evidently stung Accusia with ex
ceeding sharpness, for he threw his
arms aloft, screamed an unintelligible
malediction and dropped to his knees,
then prone upon his face, where he
writhed and wailed until two bailiffs,
one of whom fell over him, forcibly
stood him up. Meantime the wife
continued to chatter.
"He's guilty of battery â her black
eye proves the charge!" roared his
Honor. "Take both of them away!"
"And his punishment, signor â how
much â oh, when?" Jennie eagerly
asked, plucking the interpreter's
sleeve.
"Don't know â next Monday," was
the answer.

Makes L/ove to Steal.
Miss Sarah Golstein, 446 Seventh
street, obtained a warrant from Po
lice Judge Mogan yesterday for the
arrest of A. Schwartz on a charge of
petty larceny. She says Schwartz had
been paying his addresses to her and
had stolen a bed covering valued at
$40 and $4 in cash. Schwartz's prac
tice, she said, was to court a girl and
when he had ingratiated himself with
the family to steal anything that was
handy, in the belief that he would not
be prosecuted for fear of the notoriety
that would ensue. He had been dealt
with leniently by other girls, she said,
but could not bunko her and escape.

ALUMNAE OF CONVENT
TO GIVE HIGH TEA
PATIO TO BE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED
SALLY SHARP
On Wednesday evening the patio in
the Sacred Heart Presentation Con
vent will be gay with light, laughter
and music.
In the center of the court a foun
tain will play in soft cadences, while
the songs of the flower maidens will fill
the air â eweVt with the breath of
lilies and clambering roses. And the
much-discussed high tea will thus
be on.
At this time each year the good nuns
of the convent are aided by a bazaar
given by the Alumnae Association in
token of the love it bears its alma
mater â a pretty tribute, this, to the
sweet-faced women who led them so
patiently through the labyrinth of
bcoklore.
On Wednesday night entertainment
is promised within the gray stone
hall, even as in the patio, for Mme.
Fabbri- Muellerâ dear, loving and ever
young Fabbri-Mueller â will hold the
baton and direct the music. Selections
will be offered from familiar operas,
and the agred prima donna's grand
niece, Miss Jacoby, will take a leading
role.
It is said that the young woman has
inherited from her aunt her world
famous voice and "quality" â that
something which distinguishes the
artist from the mechanic.
Besides the musical features. Paul
Gerson's pupils will do a few things â
a farce and some serious work be
sides.
At 10:30 supper will be served in the
patio under the stairs, if it is not too
cold â all of which will individualize the
affair far above its fellows.
A long list of hostesses, headed by
Miss A^nes Fitzgerald, is composed
largely of members of the alumnae,
amorrr â¢whom are many of San Fran
cisco's cleverest vomen.
Although next week is to be a mad
whirl of a*Tairs, the high tea to be
jriven in the patio of the grim old con
vent at Taylor and Ellis promises great
thingE.
Everybody's going! Arc you?

KLAMATH ROAD
GAINS SUPPORT
Two representatives of the Klamath
Chamber of Commerce appeared before
a meeting of representatives of the
various commercial bodies of San
Francisco yesterday and appealed for
assistance to raise a bonus that will
insure the construction of a railroad
from Grass Valley, Or., to Klamath
Falls. Their representations promptly
secured an indorsement on the part of
the assembled men of business and a
committee was appointed, consisting of
Jsaac Upham, Andrew Carrigan, H. D.
Loveland and J. P. Currier, to visit
business men this week and secure
pledges of money to be paid on the
completion of the road, which will not
take place earlier than the last of
1906. With the San Francisco commit
tee will go President Baldwin and
Secretary Worden of the Klamath
Chamber of Commerce.
The meeting of yesterday was made
interesting by reason of the claims
concerning the advantages that San
Francisco may derive by insuring the
construction of the road in question.
A. A. Watkins and Isaac Upham sat
in the presiding officer's chair by
turns. Andrew Carrigan was the prin
cipal speaker. He presented the facts
in a very attractive form. Mr. Car
rigan went all over the Klamath
country last summer and became
thoroughly acquainted with its re
sources.
He said that the area would all be
permanently tributary to San Fran
cisco in a trade way if this city would
help to build the railroad. Very little
was asked from San Francisco in the
present instance. The total sum that
was asked of Klamath County was
$100,000. Of this the county had raised
all but $16,000. The Klamath Valley
was nearer, he said, to San Francisco
than to Portland. It was a rich coun
try in many ways. By private enter
prise irrigation *orks have been con
structed to put 30,000 acres under cul
tivation. The United States Govern
ment would expend between $3,000,000
and $4,000,000 in its great irrigation
project.
Incidentally Mr. Carrigan said that
Klamath County was about the size of
the entire State of Massachusetts. He
had never seen a section that had
greater promise. The trade territory
of San Francisco had been much con
tracted. Here was a field that it was
the duty of San Francisco to bind to
Itself.
President Baldwin of the Klamath
Chamber and others spoke. T. C.
Friedlander submitted resolutions that
indorsed the Klamath railroad pro
ject, and these were adopted without
dissent
Her Estate Is Valuable.
The inventory and appraisement of
the estate of the late Alice M. Ox
nard was filed yesterday. The estate,
which < onsists of stocks and bonds
and other personalty, is value at

holders of the Twin Peaks property.
The city has already acquired title by
private purchase to much of the proD
erty to be included in the improve
ments, but some thirty odd owners re
fused to sell ami the suits filed yester
day is to compel them to deed over
their holdings upon the payment to
them of reasonable prices. In addition
to the sixteen suits filed yesterday,
probably as many more will be filed
within the next few days. t
The most important of the suits is
that instituted against the San Fran
cisco Land Company for practically a
third each of outside land blocks 84.
169 and 269. These lands have been ao
praised by the city to be worth $50,000.
The owners demand $65,000 for them.
John Benson, owner of outside land
block 194, asks $55,000 for his prop
erty. The city hopes to get it for $47.
500. for which it has been appraised.
James E. Damon, owner of one-third
of block 296, asks $11,000 for his oroD
erty, while the city holds it is worth
only $7200.
The other defendants are Georsre N.
Norton, Georgre \V. L.ippman, Katherlne
Igle, Elbridge Durbrow. Ella L.
enthal, Winslow Anderson. Georee
nwers. Alfred D., and Caroline D.
tan, Samuel C. Irvine. Anatole
nnet, Richard S. Shainwald and
beth E. McCutchen. They all
holdings in block 84. and it is the
tntion of the city that they de
1 from $150 to $750 more than the
il value <>f theft" properties. Pur
>s in every block within the
daries of the extension have been
s at the city's figures, and the cltv
â¢ts that these purchases fix the
value of the lands and will prove valu
able evidence, t<%ether with that of ex
perts who will be called to pass on the
value, of-' lhe property^ involved.

voir and park site broucht ae&lnst
the Market and Stanyan Streets and
Golden Gate Park Improvement Com
pany, O. D.. Baldwin president. The
site includes forty-seven acres. It Is
the opinion of the city's expert that
the land is worth from $500 to $800
an acre, but the company demands
$2000 an acre.
All of the condemnation suits were
assigned by Presiding Judge Lawlor to
his department of the Superior Court
for trial. Judge Lawlor says he will
hurry them through, that the work of
adding two pleasure places to the city
may go ahead as speedily as possible.

SPRAINS ANKLES
IN EXCITEMENT
While It was backing down the pier
at the Santa Fe Main-street wharf
yesterday afternoon the brakes of a
switch engine driven, by Sam Oppen
heimer failed to work, and the en
gineer was unable to stop the progress
of the car he was switching until it
had broken through the bulkhead and
fallen into the water, almost causing
the death of Assistant Postmaster Hull
McCloughry and William Taylor, the
occupants of the car. McCloughry
Jumped from the fastly moving car
and tried to give the engineer warn
ing that they were approaching the
ed?e of the wharf, and in doing so his
ankles were sprained. He was taken
homo in a cab. The other occupant of
the wreck was unable to get out before
the car left the wharf, but escaped un
injured.
The car had been standing on the
sidetrack, and contained some of the
personal effects of Assistant Postmas
ter McCloughry brought up from Los
Angeles, and a.s he wanted to get two
Shetland ponies out of it before night
the engineer was ordered to back it
to the warehouse. In trying to do so
the accident occurred.
The freight car did not stop when it
hit the bulkhead, but, breaking
through, was only kept from sinking
by the front trucks holding it to the
fragile timbers on the pier. Several
twitch engines and a Santa Fe tug
w*re busy pulling the car back on the
â¢wharf yesterday afternoon.

The Leading Specialist.
MEN
Who call upon me in consultation
sometimes express doubt as to my
ability to effect a permanent cure.
Some say, "I've paid half a dozen
doctors for cures that I never re-
ceived." PAY ME WHEN TVE,
CURED YOU Is the straishtfor-
vrard. definite and business like
proposition I make to every afflict-
ed man.
My Cures Are Permanent,
My Fees Are Fair, and
You Can Pay When Cured
"Weakness"
If other physicians have treated
you for so-called "weakness" yon
â were helped, only temporarily, if at
all, and the reason Is very appar-
ent when the cause of loss of
power In man is understood.
"Weakness" isn't a weakness at
all. but Is merely a symptom of
chronic inflammation in the pros-
tate gland, bronarnt on by early
dissipation or some contracted disÂ»
order. My system of local treat-
ment removes this inflammation,
and is the only treatment that bas
ever or ever can permanently re-
store ctrensta and vtjror.
Varicocele
Many who are but slightly af-
flicted with varicocele believe that
the trouble Is of little conse-
quence. The opposite is true, Ve-
ricocele Is a disease of a progres-
sive nature. As it advances ner-
vous complications come, powei
diminishes and the general health
is impaired. I cure varicocele In
five days, without the use of
knife, ligature or caustic, without
pain and without detention from
business.
Contracted Disorders
Every case of contracted disease
I treat is thoroughly cured. My
patients have no relapses. When I
pronounce a case cured there is
not a particle of infection or In-
flammation remaining, and there is
not the 6llghtest danger that the
disease will return in its original
form or work its way into the gen-
eral system. So contracted dis-
order Is so trivial as to warrant
uncertain methods of treatment,
and I especially solicit those cases
that other doctors have been un-
able to cure.
Specific Blood Poison
To men who for years have been
dosed with dangerous mineral poi-
sons In an endeavor to keep this
hideous leprosy dormant my state-
ment that I positively drive the
â¼cry last taint cf virus from the
system may seem like an exagger-
ation. But I accomplish Just this,
and without the use of dangerous
drugs. My treatment for conta-
gious . blood poison thoroughly
cleanses the entire system in a re-
markably short time, â¢ and every
trace and symptom disappear for-
ever. '

ran bis race. If he did, then the track
had dried out so fast as to be past
his liking. A fierce plunge was Insti

Travers, forcing the odds from 7 to
4%. Travers rode a patient, waiting
race on the Ferguson horse, and,
catching Honlton in the last stride, his
number was flashed first. The show

about apsitstant starters.
Only the strong finishing powers of
"Handriding" Kelly landed Possart
winner of the mile and a quarter sell

the starter's hands a 2 to 1 favorite
and in a three- head finish at the wire
with Iras and Expedient the mount of
Kelly received the verdict. Byroner
dale quit after cutting out most of the
pace.
There was not the slightest doubt in
the world but that Iredeus possessed the
speed of the nine starters in the mile
selling number. Dr. Rowell's horse
looked bo good* to everybody for, some
inexplicable reason that the money was
simply pitchforked into the books on
the chances of the big bay.
IREDEUS BREAKS DOWN.
Unfortunately, good things crawl,
and when opposite thÂ« paddock with
the race at his mercy, Iredeus broke
down, running unplaced. Ocyrohe then
won easily from Warte Nicht. Stllicho,

COFFROTH STILL
RETAINS FAITH
Promoter Asks White and
Britt to Wait Till May
6 for a Definite Answer
ALL PARTIES SATISFIED
Manager of Yosemite Club
Agrees to Kelease Brit
isher if Permit Fails
The Britt-White fight is as fax away
as ever and just as uncertain. It was
expected Manager Jim Coffroth would
declare himself last night when he
came In contact with Willis Britt and
Charley Mitchell, but, instead, the pro
moter pf the Yosemite Club asked for
a few more days' grace, which the
managers of the rival pugs kindly con
sented to give. They agreed to wait
till May 6 for a final decision.
Coffroth seems clutching at the last
straw, and, according to his own ad
missions, he has hopes of landing that
permit at the eleventh hour, though by
what means nobody but himself really
knows. He hinted at a big stunt that
was due to come off on Monday and in
timated he would let the public know
then whether the mill would come off
or not.
When Willie Britt, Mitchell and Cof
froth came together last night at
Harry Corbett's they chatted over
events in a casual way and then
went into an executive session
that lasted but a few minutes.
Possibly they all knew what to
Bay to one another when they got
together, for they emerged from the
private chamber In Jig time. Coffroth
announced that Mitchell and Britt had
kindly agreed to wait till May 6 in or
der to hear good or bad news.
Neither Britt nor Mitchell appeared
provoked nor put out over the situa
tion. ThÂ»ey seemed to accept things as
a sort of matter of course and to look
up to Coffroth as their guiding star and
all around good angel. Both seem per
fectly satisfied with the news the mag
nate gently broke. Both agreed to wait
just as long as the promoter willed.
Coffroth evidently figures on bringing
something over on Monday. He has
hopes of promoting the fight yet,
though by what process ls a strict se
cret. "White and Britt have agreed to
wait till May 6 for me," said Coffroth.
"By that time I expect to know some
thing. If I am not sure of the bout one
way or the other I will release White
and Mitchell from their obligations on
April 26. That is all I have to say."
When Willis Britt heard the neiÃ, he
immediately phoned Jimmy at the
beach to cut out his hard work for a
few days till It was definitely known
what was about to come off. Mitchell
laid White off yesterday and the Brit
isher will take a few days' rest and cut
out all worry and business talk till his
manager gives Mm the office to go
ahead once more.

WATCHING HAWTHORNES.
Grand Jury Will Stop Fights of Al-
leged Amateur Club.
Though the Hawthorne Athletic
Club has obtained a permit from the
Supervisors to hold amateur fights on
Tuesday night, it now seems certain
the bouts will be stopped by the
Grand Jury. "The club must belong to
the Pacific Athletic Association and
the fights must be held in a club
gymnasium," declared Foreman An
drews yesterday.
â¢ Al and Louis Young, who repre
sented the Hawthorne Club, told An
drews that their organization belonged
to the Pacific Athletic Association, but
the foreman called William Greer Har
rison and Attorney Peixotto. who de
clared that this was false. The
Youngs admitted finally that they did
not belong to the association.
The Hawthorne representatives con
sulted Chief Dinan and the District
Attorney, who referred them to Fore
man Andrews. Last night Al Young
was attempting to have the Hawthorne
Club admitted to the Pacific Associa
tion. Even if he succeeds, the fights
cannot come off in Woodward's Pa
vilion.

Misses Weed and Van VHet Rally and

The final r-tch for, the Olds cups,
played by the young ladles at Golden

teresting struggle. The contestants
â¢were Miss Lulu Wegener and Mrs. C.
Watson and Miss Dorothy Weed and
Miss Sarita Van Vllet. The latter won
two sets out of three, scoring their
first victory for the trophies. Miss
Wegener and Mrs. Watson played from
15 1-6 back of scratch, while their op
ponents were 1-6 above scratch. The
Score was 6-3; 3-6; 7-5.
The strong wind made little differ
ence to the California Club players,
who turned out in large numbers.
Some close and interesting matches
were played. Dr. McChesney and
George Janes met for the first time,
and the spectators were treated to
some fast tennis. Janes won three
straight sets, all of which were close.
McChesney has had but little practice
of late and was rather wild. On the
other hand Janes was at his best and
played an excellent frame. All three
sets were 6-4 and all went to Janes.
The best match in doubles was that
between Prank Mitchell and Grant
Smith and Sidney Salisbury and Ar
thur Chesebrough. The latter played
good tennis, wipning the first set by a
6-3 score. Mitchell and Smith im
proved in the second and third seta,
both of which they won, 8-3.

Uncle has the satisfaction of beat-
Ing Oakland once, even If he can never
turn the trick again. With barely one
to the good, the Seals quit at Recrea
tion Park yesterday afternoon happy
and jubilant. They had the luck, and
also profited by some rough work of
the Commuters, so everything was
fine and dandy. Score: San Francisco,
Sj Oakland, 2.
Whalen and Schmidt, the pair who
battled for sixteen rounds at Oakland
on Tuesday, were trotted out again,
and the crowd held its breath, expect
ing Jo see at least : -enty-four rounds
of heartrending baseball. But it was
not to be, for the game was only a
few minutes old when the Seals broke
In with a run.
Although slow and tedious at times,
the game was about the best of the
series, for there was a little hitting
In it at least, and the fielders were
given a chance to chase the leather
once in a while and make a few throws
around the lot. A high wind was blow-
Ing, which interfered to some extent
with the work.
Spencer started the music for Uncle
in the first with a hit. He immediate
ly pilfered and advanced again on
Devereaux's boot of Walters' grounder.
Hildebrand's bang to left lield scored
him. Irwln partook of a pass in the
fifth and stole second and third. He
got away with the last play while Mc-
Murry held the ball. The little catcher
thought the bases were full and did not
heave It. Irwln trotted in when Shea
laid down a neat bunt
Again in the sixth the Seals came
through. Walters was passed, but
Devereaux put the ball on him at third
when he tried to slide In on Hilde
brand's clout to left. Hllde got as far
bp second on the play. Irwln's wal
lop out to deep center put him over.
Oakland could not get started until
the seventh, when Dunleavy unloaded
a doublo-sacker over third and Kelly
responded with a drive too hot for
Spencer to handle, letting Dun trot In.
With the bases full and one down in
the eighth. Kruger forced Francks at
second, and Schmidt made the rubber
on the play. Dr. Moskiman was called
in to bat for M"c Murray In the ninth,
but he could not make good with the
little old hit.
Umpire Perrlne was hit by a foul
ball in the fifth and was out for sev
eral minutes. Kelly again kept right
with the fans by driving Oakland's
first run through and tearing off an
other hit In the ninth. He made his
first error of the series yesterday on
a slow hit ball to second base. The

JUKL3 -TO IfEAZ,
A Source of Constant Worry
and an Injury to Health.
; Whenever a sore or ulcer refuses to heal it is a sure sign ,that thereÂ«ris something
wrong [ with the blood. â  It .is not healthy as ;it should ,be, but infected with some germ or
perhaps old blood taint that has lain dormant in the system for years awaiting a favorable
opportunity for manifesting itself. Then often an insignificant scratch, cut or bruise will
develop into a festering sore that resists all treatment and becomes a source of daily care
and worry, ; affecting the entire health and causing the sufferer many hours of anxiety.
Those most usually afflicted with sores and ulcers are persons who have reached or passed
middle life. The vitality of the blood and strength of the system have naturally begun to
wane, and the poisonous germs with which it is saturated force an outlet on the face, arms,
legs or some other part of the body and form a sore or ulcer. This being fed by a poisoned
blood supply, grows red and angry, festers and eats into the surrounding tissue until it be-
comes what is very aptly termed "an old sore." While the old or middle-aged are the usual
â  sufferers, the young are; not exempt if the blood becomes infected with the germs.
- How aggravating and stubborn these places are can best be told by some person who
has nursed and treated one for years, applying salves, powders, washes and the like until
his patience is exhausted and with no good results. The sore or ulcer remains and con-
tinues its work of destruction by eating deeper into the surrounding flesh, and distributing
its poison through the circulation to all parts â¢- . t jy-i -I -â

The clerks of. the accident and life
departments of the Pacific Mutual
Life Insurance Company met on the
Presidio athletic grounds yesterday
and crossed bats for honors at base
ball. The accident clerks war* the
victors. ScorÂ© 9to 6.
There were maoy of the players
who showed they were at home on the
baseball field aft well a* at figuring
profit and loss In the office of an
insurance house. There were others
who essayed to make a burlesque of
the national game. The boys from
the accident department put up a good
game. Pitcher Burkee and Shortstop
Parker played well.
"Hit It. Harry," "Make a home run.
Harry," lustily shouted a pretty dark
eyed miss, smartly attired In blue, as
on* of the players marched to the
plate. There were three of his team
mates occupying bases and it was for
him to bring them home. While the
ocempants of the grand stand remained
quiet, the dark-eyed miss continued
her shouts of encouragement. "He
will knock a home run," she said.
Harry struck out; no more encourage
ment was heard. The occupants
looked for the fair one who was shout-
Ing, but she had disappeared. When
the game had ended she emerged
from behind a post in the farthest cor
ner of the grand stand.
Following is the lineup of the
teams: Accidents â Jansen, third base;
Durkee, catcher; J. Durkee, pitcher;
Penfleld, second base; Parker, short
stop; McFadden, left field; Dungan,
center held; Elater, first base, and
Keagle, right field.

Washington Crop Bulletin.
rej>ort of G. N. Salisbury, section <.:
rector United States Weather Bureau, for the
Waahlnsrtnfi Crop Bulletin, week ended April
Ttoe j>asi week was one with cold nights,
â¢ on the 10th and llta, which were
- â¢ harmful, but are thought to have
i>rurÂ»Â« and cherry blossoms in some lo-
Tbere were showers on several days,
ere wu a. general deficiency in the usual
ra DCs Â»hich, however, Is not
. recent time.
The weather was very favorable for spring
work, such as plowing, harrov.!r;g, seeding and
planting. It was not unfavorable for the
grow tii of grain and grass, although the cool
riiphts have made growth somewhat slow. Win
ter wheat hrrroves slowly, and its present
condition is very satisfactory. Considerable
early sswn tprtng wheat has come up, and
only needs some warm and moist weather to
make it crow rapidly. Spring wheat, sowing
is mill ccmz-leted, in all except the late lo
caiittee. Barley and oat sowing are also well
along; tfxeept oat aowliig in the lowlands of
Bkasit County, where it is not half done yet.
J-'crrners are not very far along with potato
plfcr.ung. Same early potatoes are up, but are
â net r: owing rapidly. Barly gardens are in a
satisfactory stag* of progress.

â  of affairs was coincident with a report that
! representatives of Gates and Armour at a
, secret meeting had made a joint agreement to
liquidate May holdings and switch into the
1 July option, thus forming a basis for a deal
'. in July wheat by means of which any possible
; loss from the attempted "squeexe" tin May
might be offset. With startling rapidity the
! price of May kept tumbling headlong, giving
1 hardly so much ac breathing time to the
I traders who had been caught en the wrong
side of the market. Scenes in the pit were
I among the wildest ever witnessed on the floor,
I traders shouting themselves frantic in an
1 effort to make or break â¢ prices. The lowest
I point of the day was reached a few minutes
', before the close, the price touching 95 He a
clean drop of imo from Thursday's final

I close of business, however, caught the market
at the traditionally magic ideal. $1 a bushel.
I While May was experiencing such a downward
whirl the price. of later deliveries dropped only
a trifle. July selling off to 86% c. In addition
Ito the slump in May, 1 predictions of rain
I throughout the wheat belt had a weakening:
influence on the July option. The close fcr
j July was firm at 56%056%c.
i The extraordinary developments in the wheat
pit reduced trading m the corn market to a

â¢ unfavorable effect on the crop, but no damage
I If indicated as s yet. either by weather condi
1 tion* or Insects. The condition of the crop Is
j less favorable than at the beginning of the
month, but no loss in acreage is reported. The
t â  Armour people for days have been credited
: with buying July Wheat, and they must have
accumulated quite a line ; and the strength
diÂ«p!ayed to-day seemed to suggest that the
â¢trade is pretty well sold out In addition to
crop uncertainties the foreign political situa
tion reems to us to be a prop under the win
u-r months. An unfavorable turn In the for
â  isn political situation, with the likelihood of
' more powers to be drawn Into the Far East

, and result in sharply higher prices. Market in

Hove that with a little encouragement prices
could be made eharply higher."

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The usual dullness incident to the closing of
Cha week prevailed in the market for old Pota
toes and quotations for all descriptions were
unchanged. New were firm and active under
a brisk demand for shipping and local use and
the best selections brought higher prices. Aus
tralian Onions were easy but unchanged and
new Green were weaker under heavy supplies.
There are no Oregon Onions available and, as
the crop is practically exhausted, the quota
tions are withdrawn.
Miscellaneous vegetables were generally
active and quotations for several descriptions
were advanced. Asparagus was wanted for
shipment and ruled firm at higher rates and
Tomatoes continued to command fancy prices.
String Beans and other southern vegetables
were quoted steady to firm. Peas were abun
dant and weak, with very little business re
ported at the top quotation, and Rhubarb was
a drug on the market.

Receipts of "Butter. Cheese and Eggs were J
very heavy, as will be- seen. Still, there was 1
no decline in any of them, and in fact the

higher at 19e. Four cars have beÂ«n shipped j

LEAGUE FORCES
ARE ORGANIZING
Prepare to Oust Looters
and Grafters From Control
of the Central Government
SELECT HEADQUARTERS
Republican Workers in All
Districts to Be Recognized
by the New Organization
The executive oomxnittee of the San
Francisco Republican League held &
meeting yesterday afternoon and made
considerable progress in the work of or
ganization for the municipal campaign.
At the meeting of the general oom
mlttee in Pioneer Hall Saturday even
ing. April 18, George D. Clark waa
â¢iected president and Daniel A Ryan
secretary. The executive committee
yesterday elected State Senator Rich
ard J. Welch first vice president and
Darid Rich second vioe president. At
the Pioneer Hall meeting the duty of
r)Â»mii>g a finance committee of forty
members was placed on President
dark. Many names were considered
at the session of the executive commit
tee yesterday. Announcement of the
names selected will be made within the
next ten days. The president wants
the assurance of cordial support from
every citisen appointed on the commit
tee before the list Is given to the pub
lic
The league has engaged rooms at 636
Market street, opposite the Palace Ho
tel, for general headquarters through
out the campaign. Many accessions to
membership are reported. It is the
judgment of the promoters of the
movement that the league is destined
to become a powerful organization.
The looters at the City Hail are pre
dicting that the organisers of the
league will make many mistakes or
blunders in the selection of Assembly
district committees and thus open the
way for grafters to get in their work of
opposition.
George D. Clark, D. A. Ryan, R. J.
"Welch, David Rich, B. J. Bowes, John
lAcknunn, Fairfax H. Wheelan and
James A Wilson- are not amateurs in
the field of politics. They propose to
hear from the active representative
.men of every district before they make
up the sub-committees. Ample time
will be taken to give the subject full
consideration. Arguments presented by
the representative Republicans of the
eeveral districts will be listened to.
Home rule principles will be recognized.
The purpose of the league is to bring
all the good citizens into one camp in
order to down the looters and grafters
at the primary election on Tuesday
August S.
In due time the Republican County
Committee, the governing body of the
party, will establish the basis of dis
trict representation in the nominating
convention and fix a time for the dele
mble and nominate a
municipal ticket. There are indica
tions that a large majority of the
county ( ommitteemen will give their
best efforts to promote the success of
the Republican League of San Fran
rife.-o. Ii i<= expected that Ruef will
enlist ns many deserters as can be ral
lied unaer the banner of graft to give
the Republican organization a battle
at the primary polls, but all the signs
*U present :>oint to hie downfall.
The heroic action taken by the Re
publican County Committee at its re
cent meeting in B. B. Hall deprived
Ruef of his prestige in that body.
With a small force of deserters from
the Republican party he- may effect
Some sort of a combination with
Democratic outca.-'
It is understood that the leaders of
the San Francisco League will pay spe
cial attention to the work of consoli
dating the Republican forces south of
Market street, where the looters and
grafters are endeavoring to create the
lmpretsion thai the men who are fos
tering the movement for better man
agement of municipal affairs are not
in sympathy with workingmen. The
wage-earners and taxpayers in the dis
tricts from the Twenty-eighth to the
Thirty-sixth have been fooled once too
mtien. Ruef and hip emissaries will
Bnd it a hard task to fool them again.
BUSINESS MEN THANKFUL â¢ '
*T>R RELIGIOUS SERVICES
Adopt Resolutions ' Thanking Clergy
men and Committee for Urging
' Good Work Along.. .
â  The members -of the Chamber of
Commerce yesterday adopted the fol
lowing resolutions of thanks for the
religious services held during .Lent .-In
the assembly room of the organization:
"Those who have attended these
meetings offer their most hearty thanks
to the committee who inaugurated
them; to the ministers of the various
conffi=ega.tions who kindly delivered the
addresses; to the organists, who have
Riven such able assistance to the wor
ship of praise, and to the trustees of
the Chamber of Commerce for gener
ously, placing their rooms at the dis
posal of the committee.
"This resolution would not be com
plete; without acknowledging the im
fnense value of these meetings, and the
Interest so constantly manifested by
the large attendance.including men of
many walks of life and belonging to
various religious bodies.
-The enjoyment of these united serv
ices is known and felt; the results can
not fail t0 ,* be worthy of the efforts;
S^l/L 11 / Xperience of the blessed
tie that binds hearts in Christian love-
Trill long abide with us."

Mishap.
An underground fuse of the Mutual
Electric Light Company blew out early
last evening and all the stores and

was carried on under difficulties.
The Ferry building was in darkness
also and candles were used to illumi
nate that structure. Workmen were
immediately put to work on the cir
cuit in an effort to locate the defective
fuse.

whisky spread over the floor of the sa
loon. Two of the bullets had perfo

SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
RAID A LOTTERY JOINT
Arrests Are Made In the Headquarters
of the Panama Company on
Market Street.
Secret Service Agents Hazen, Moffltt
and Foster raided the headquarters of
the "Panama Lottery Company," at 916
Market street, last evening and arrested
A. C. Karski and Henry Morris, two of
the promoters. The detectives secured
a large quantity of evidence and the
men will be held to answer for having
sent lottery tickets from one State into
another. The company is comparatively
unknown in the city, although it has
been in operation for some time. Agents
sold tickets throughout the country
and largely in the Middle States.
The office which was raided was sup
posed to be the office of real estate
men. The secret service men required
but two days to locate it and in a back
room were found stacks of tickets, a
number of which were done up in pack
ages and ready for shipment. The com
pany sent out circulars soliciting
agents and received its mail under
many names, all of which was calculat
ed to mislead the postal authorities in
the event of any investigation. The
express service was utilized in the
transportation of tickets.
Driver to Give Piano Recital.
Maurice Leon Driver, a pianist who

way Hall on Monday evening. He will
play his own compositions. According
to critics in the larger European cities,
he is highly talented.
