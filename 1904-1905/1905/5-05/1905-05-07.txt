ym f HEN I look at the three mas
111 6ive t manuscript.volumes which
VJL/ contain our work for the year
1904, I confess that it is very,
difficult for me, out of such a
\u25a0wealth of material, ' to select the cases
which are most interesting in'them
selves, and at the same time most con
ducive to a display of. those peculiar
powers for which my friend nvas fa
mous. As I turn aver the pages I see niy
notes uppn<thfe repulsive, story of the
red leech ,and the' terrible death of
Crosby, the banker. Here . also I find
an account of the-Addelton tragedy,
and the singular contents" of ./the an
cient "British ;' barrow. - t The famous
Smith-Mortimer succession . case comes
also within this period, and so does the
tracking and arrest of Huret,' the boule
vard assassinâ an exploit', which won
for Holmes an . autograph letter of
thanks from the French President" and
the Order of the Legion of vHonor.
Each of these would furnish a narra
tive, * but on the whole I am of the
opinion that none of them unites so
many singular points of interest as the
episode of Yoxley Old Place, which in-
palimpsest. "I've done enough f or.one *;

come at 13 o'clock. The professor de--,
clares that he heard the distant : cry, ;
but that he knows ' nothing more.. He
can give no explanation of the young
man's last words, Professorâ it â¢
was ehe,' *but imagines that they" were
tha outcome of delirium. â¢ He believes
that Willoughby Smith had not an;ene
my in the world, and can glva no rea- .
son for tha crime. His first action was
to send Mortimer, the gardener, for the :
local police. A little later . the chief
constable sent for me. Nothing was
moved before I got there, and strict
ordei-3 were given that no one should
walk upon the paths leading to the
house. It was a splendid chance of
putting your theories Into practice, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes. There really
nothing wanting."
"Except Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said
my companion, with a somewhat bitter
smile- "Well, let us 'hear about it
What sort of a job did you make
cf it?''
"I must ask you first, Mr. Holmes,
to glance at this rough plan; which will
jive you a general Idea of the position
of the professor's study and the var-ir.
ous points of the case. It will help
you in following my investigation."
He unfolded the rough chart, which
I here reproduce, and he laid it across
Holmes' knee. I rose, and, standing
behind Holmes, studied it over his
shoulder.
"It is very rough, of course, and It
only deals with the points which
seem to me to be essential. ' All the
rest, you will see later for yourself.

cerve, handsomely, mounted \u25a0â¢ in j solid I".
gold, and it is inconceivable that r any' ?
one , who wore such glasses' could be -
slatternly .in other' respects. .You : will,;
find that the clips are too' { wide. for your.?;
nose, ; showingâ that ; the;, lady's ' nose '\u25a0;
was very board at the base. This sort J
of nose Is , usually , a ; short : and coarse ;?/
one,; but .there^ is a sufficient â¢.number.;'
of exceptions to : prevent me from ;be^;,i
Ing .'dogmatic or from insisting, upon i. 1
this point in my description. â¢ My own
face'is a/narrow one, and yet: l find
that I. cannot get^ my -eyes into 'the/
center nor / near,- the center of ' these^
glasses.' Therefore /the*, lady's /eyes -*
are set very l near to the "sides, of -the//
nose. You will; perceive, Watson.Hhat/*'
the biases are concave and of unusual 1 -"
strength. A lady., whose vision has -been:/
so extremely.: contracted; all her : lif e is .
sure to have the physical ;. character- â¢
istics of such. vision; which are 'seen in
the foreheaa, the eyelids- and the
shoulders.". ' . . % '
"Yes," I. said, "I â¢ can .follow, each ;of ?

that I am unable* to understand how.

Holmes took the glasses in his. hand./
\u25a0 "You "will perceive," he said, ;"that. â¢
the -clips' are lined with tiny tbands of ;
cork to soften the pressure; upon .'the:;.
nose. One of these is discolored -arid^
worn to. some slight 'extent,' but ithe';-
Now, fti-st of all, presuming, that tne
assassin entered the house, how did he~
or she come in? Undoubtedly by the '
garden ' path and , the back door, from
which there is direct access to the
study. Any other way would have been \u25a0
exceedingly complicated- The escape
must have also been made along that
line, for of the two other exits from
the room one was. blocked by Susan
as she ran downstairs and, the other
leads straight to the professor's bed
room. I therefore directed my atten
tion at once to the garden path, which
was saturated with recent rain, and
would certainly show any footmarks.
"My examination showed me that I
was dealing with a cautious and ex- \u25a0
pert criminal. No footmarks were to
be found on the path. There could be
no Question, however, that 1 some one
had passed along the grass border
which lines the path, and that he had .
done so. In order to avoid* leaying' a
track. I could not find anything in
the nature of a distinct impression, but
the grass was trodden down and some"
one had undoubtedly passed. It could .
only have been the murderer, since
neither the gardener nor any one else
had been there that morning and the
rain had only begun during the night."
/"One moment," said Holmes- "Where
does this path lead to?"
" '*Tb the road.''
"How long is it?"
"A hundred yards or so."
"At the point where the path passes
through the gate, you could surely
pick up the tracks?"
* "Unfortunately,' the path was tiled
at that point."
"Well, on the road itself?"
"No, it was all trodden into mlre.7 .
"Tut-tut! Well, then, these tracks
upon the grass, were they coming or
going?"
"It was impossible to say. There was
never any outline." -
"A large foot or a small?"
"You could not distinguish."
Holmes gave an ejaculation of im
patience.
"It has been pouring rain and blow
ing a hurricane ever since," . said he.
"It will be harder to . read now than
that palimpsest Well, well, it can't
be helped. What did you do, Hopkins,
after you had made certain that you
had made certain of nothing?"
, "1 think I made certain of a good
deal, Mr. Holmes. I knew that some
one had entered the house cautiously;
from without I next examined the
corridor. It is lined with cocoanut mat
ting, and had taken no impression of
any kind. This brought me into the
study itself. It Is a scantily furnished
room. The main article is a large
writing table with a fixed bureau. This
bureau consists of a double column of
drawers, with a central small cup
board between them. The drawers
were open, the cupboard locked. The
drawers; It seems, were always open,
and nothing of value was kept in them.
There were some papers of importance
in the cupboard, but there were no;
signs that this had been tampered with,
and the professor assures me that
nothing was missing. It is certain that
no robbery has been committed.
"I come now to the body of the young
man. It was found near the bureau, and
just to the left of it, as marked upon
the chart. # The stab was : on 1 the right
side of the neck and from behind for-"-,
ward, so that it is almost impossible
that it could have been â¢.self-inflicted."..
"Unless he fell upon the knife," said
Holmes."
"Exactly. The idea crossed my. mind.
But we found the knife some feet away
from the body, bo that seems impossi
ble. Then, of course,, there are the
man's own dying words.; ' And,', finally,
there was this; very important piece of
evidence which .was found clasped in
the dead man's right, hand."
From his pocket Stanley Hopkins
drew a small paper packet He jUn-,,
folded it and disclosed a' golden pince
nez, with two broken ends of black

;She had risen; but she fell back asrain
with a little cry of vain.
"I must finish." she said. "When
my.,term was over. I set myself to get
the diary, and letters which. ; if sent to
the Russian Government, would t>ro
cure my friend"s release. I knew, that
my husband had come to Encland.
After ; months of searching I discover
ed where he was. I knew that he still
had ; the", diary,: for when I \u25a0 was in Si
beria I had a letter from him, once, re
proaching 'me and quoting some pas
sages from its pages. Yet I was sure
that with his .revengeful nature, he
would never give It to me of his own
free will. I must get it for myself. .
With this object I engaged an agent
from a private detective firm, who en
tered my husband's house as a secre-'
taryâ it was your second secretary.
Sergiua, the one who left you so hur
riedly. He found that papers were kept
in the cupboard, and he got an Impres
sion of the key. He would. not co far
ther. He furnished : me with a plan of
the house, and he told me that in tha
forenoon the study was always empty,
as the secretary was employed up here.
So , at last I took courage â¢ in . both
hands, and I came down to set the
papers for myself. I succeeded: but at
what a cost!
"I had Just taken the papers and was
locking the cupboard/ when- tha youns:
man seized me. I had seen him already
that morning... He had met me on the
road, and. l had asked him to tell me
where Professor Coram lived,; not
knowing that he was In his employ."
"Exactly! exactly!" said Holmes.
"The secretary came, back and told his
employer, of â¢ the <\u25a0 woman he had met:
Then in , his last breath he tried to
send a message that it. was - she â tha
she. whom he had just discussed with
him." '\u25a0
:\u25a0 "You Â« must let â¢me * sr>eak," said " the
woman, In an imperative voice and her*

/ f" y ELF-SLAIN!" The words of '
* >Ov l^ e priest, as Gordon stood
YJ there.. fce?njcd lo re-echo about
pâ^ him with infinite variations of
ajrony. He had ridden vacant
of": imrposcf. destitute <jI piai:â thrilling .
only to reach her. Desperate. lawless
thoughts had runs through his mind as "
he galloped. Entering tfco garden Us
â¢ had seen the 1 _rriages and heard the
chaplain's cry at the same moment
Ther., with the awful instantaneous
ness of an electric bolt, the bia-.v had
fallen. It was the last finalityâ the
closure of the ultimate gateway of hope
â tfee utter assurance of the unescapa
ble doom in which all ends save the
worm that dies not and the fire that â¢
is not quenched.
He drew closer to the altar, his step
dragging as he walkedâ his infirmity
grown all at once painfully appaientâ
and gazed at the mute face on the
cushions. The priest and his escort
were forgotten. He knew nothing save
that dreadful assertion that had sent
the nuns hastily from the dc-or.^tellins
their beads, and had forbidden even the
servant to enter.
Self-slain? No, but slain by George
Gordonâ the accursed bearer of all
maracatha, damned to the last jot and
tittle. He had done her to death as
'surely as if his own hand had held the
piiiuf lying there to her lips. It was
because he had stayed in Ravenna that
she lay here dead before the crucifixâ
tne symbol that she had sought at San
Lazzarro, that Padre Somalian had
prayed to!
Siaring ; across hueless wastes of
rental torture to a blank horizon,
something the friar had said came to
him: "Every man bears a cross of
despair to his Calvary." What a vacu
ous futility! Infinity, systems, worlds,
ir.an. biain. Was this the best the
aecn-lons evolution could offer? This
bloodless image nailed upon a tree?
What had it availed h<*r? J
He suddenly fell on his knees beside
her. Dead? Teresa dead? Why. a
few months .before, at the monastery,
he had regarded death for himself with
calmness, almost with satisfaction. But
not for herâ never for her. Was she
dead, and he to live onâ never to see
her, to hear her speak, not even to
know that she was somewhere in the
\u25a0world ?
He saw for the first time the little
book lying open on her breast in the
candle-light. He tc-ok it mechanically
and turned its leaves. As mechanically
his eye read, not sensible of what it
translated, but as surcharged agony
unconsciously geeks relief in the doing
of simple, habitual things:
When presently through all thy veins shall ran
A cold an* drowsy humor; lor no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
>'o warmth, no breath, shall testify thou llvest;
So roses In thy lips and cheek* shall fade
To paiy ashes; thy eyes' windows tall.
14ke death, when he shuts up the day of life!
And In this borrowed likenees of shrunk death
Thou ehait continue two and forty houra,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
The last words of the monk Gordon
repeated aloud, "And then awake as
from a pleasant sleep."
A sudden tingling sensation leaped
through every nerve. He snatched at
the phial and bent to its labelâ"Mah
dragora."
â¢ With an Inarticulate, cry he sprang
up, leaped to the nearest window and
smashed it frantically with his fist. The
splintering glass cut his hand, but he
did not feel it. He caught a fragment
as it fell, and in a second was hold
ing It close over Teresa's parted lips. \
He waited a time that seemed a
dragging eternity, then lifted it to the
candle light and looked with fearful
earnestness. The faintest tarnish,
light as grossamer film., clouded it.
The crystal clashed upon the floor.
He seized and emptied one of the rose;
bowls and rushed out through the
darkening flower paths to the fountain
In the garden. Gbldush flirted and
glistened in panic as he filled the bowl
with the icy water. Hi hurried back,
dipped Teresa's stirless hands into its
coldness and dashed it over h*r face,
drenching her white neck and the dull
gold hair meshed on , the velvet-
Three separate -times ha did this.
Then, breathless, he seized her arms
and began to move them as one re
suscitates a half-drowned person. try-
Ing to rouse the lungs to action to
throw off the lethal torpor of ihe bella
donna-like opiate.
] He worked for many minutes, the
moisture running from his forehead,
his breath coming In gasps. Laboring,
he 'thought of the dire risk. she had
run. trusting all to his promise to re
turn and to his divination. He, re
membered he had said -a' drachm/ To
make assurance doubly sure, might
ehehave taken more?
He kept watching: her featuresâ the
rigor seemed to be loosening. \u25a0 the
marble rigidity softening * its outlines.
But heart and pulse were still. In de
spair he laid his warm lips close upon
the cold ones and filled' her lungs with
a great expiration, again and again!
He lifted himself, tremt>linj? now
with hope. The lungs, responding to
that forced effort, had begun to renew
their -function. -"\u25a0 Her bosom rose ; arid
fen â Flowly. but still it was life. He
dried her face and chafed her hands
"between his own. She commenced ; to:
breathe, more naturally and rhythm
ically; at lengtii she sighed and Etirred
on the, cushions. I
, A , rush of tears blinded Gordon's
eyesâ the ; first he : had shed since the
night, in London ; when he : had '. bent,
abovo the little , empty, snow silent bed
that had held Ada. He dashed; them
away, seeing "that .Teresa's eyes were

"All Is well. Do you remember?"
Her eyes, roaminr at first bewildered, |
saw the dark chapel, the flaring, garish
candles, caught the expression of his
face, still drawn and haggardi and
white with strain. All came back upon
her. in a surge. She half raised her
self, his arm supporting her. They two |
there aloneâ the pries=t goneâ the dusk â¢
fallen tv night. She had succeeded!
Gordon had comeâ his arms held her!
In the joyful revulsion she turned
her face to hirrr'and threw her arms
about his neck, feeling herself caught
up in his embrace, every liber shud- .
deringr with the terror passed, \u25a0weep
ing- v.'ith weak delight, clinging to him
as to her refuge, still dizzy and Jaint,
but with safe assurance and peace.
Looking down at her where she
rested, her face buried, on his breast,
her whole -form shaken with feeling,
murmuring broken words, slowly call
ing back her strength. Gordon felt j
doubt and indecision drop from his
mind. The convent was not for her
â not by all she had suffered that day!
Only one thing else remained to take
her* away forever, beyond the papal
frontier â with him! Fate, and the
world had give*i her to him now by
the resistless logic of circumstance.
He reckoned swiftly.
The news by this time had reached
the casa in Ravenna. Another half
hour at most and choice would be
taken fron\ their hands. They must
lose no time. Yet whither? Where ".;
â¢could he go, that hatred would not
pursue? To what Ultima Thule could
he fly, that the poison barb would not
follow to wound her happiness?
Where to live? Never in England! In
the East â in Greece, perhaps, the
land of his youthful dreams? It was
a barbarian pashawlik, under the foot
of Ottoman greed; neither a. fit nor se
cure habitation. In Italy, where her
soul must always be? Tuscany â Pisa.
wTTere Shelley lived â was not far dis
tant. They might reach its borders in
safety. There they would be beyond
the rule of Homagna, out of the states
of the church.
"Dearest," asked Gordon, "are you
strong enough to ride?" *
She stirred instantly in his arms
and stood up, though unsteadily. "Yea,
yes, some one will come. We must
go quickly.
"I will saddle and fetch a horse for
you to the chapel door."
She was feeling the sharp edge of
fear again. "I shall be quite strong
presently," she assured him. "Let us
wait no longer." :
He went nolslessly to the stables.
He had dreaded meeting \u25a0 some \u25a0 one,
but old Elsie, beside herself with
grief, had run to watch. for those who
should come from Ravenna and the
rest of the servants, dazed by the ca
lamity, were huddled in the kitchen.
Leading the horse, Gordon returned
speedily.. : ; : -
He put his arms aÃtatftTeresa rathe
chapel doorway for an instant and
held her close. He was feeling a call
he had never felt before, the call that
nature and civilization have planted
in man deep as the desire far off
spring, the song of the silver-singing
goddess, whose imarble image, on the
night he had made that fatal trothing
with Annabel, had been blackened by
his thrown .inkwell â Vesta, the per
sonification of the hearthstone,' of
home. - I'
. Teresa suddenly â¢â '-nt that to him!
Home! Npt such a one as he had
. known at Newstead Abbey, with Hob
house and Sheridan and Moore. Not
a gray moated pile wound with the
tragic fates of his own bloodâ a house
c-f mirth, tut.not-of happiness! Not
like the one in Piccadilly Terrace,
where he ha 4 lived with Annabel that
one year of" fever and heartsickness ;
and fading ideals! No, but a home
that should be no part of his past; a,
nook enisled, where spying eyes might;
not enter, here ' c should redeem thtrse
barren pledges he had i once made to
life, in the coin of real love.
"Teresa," he said, "from the journÂ«y
we begin this hour there can be no re-.,
turn. It is out of the world you have Â§
lived in and known! If there were any
other way for youâ save that oneâ-'*,;
"My life!", she whispered.
The soft- voiced passion of her tender
ness thrilled him. "You go to exile."
he went on, "to an alien place^-"
"There is no exile, except from you,
' nor alien . place ; where you are! The
â¢world . that disowns you . may. cast me
outâ ah, I shall be glad!"
He laughed a low laugh of utter con
tent. Lightly as if-, she had been a
chiid, ho lifted her into the; saddle.
Supporting her at first, he led- the horse
. over the turf and into the driveway
where his own waited. .
Then" mounting, his hand holding her
bridle, they rode into the velvety darkJ-
Old Elise, tearfully -watching the Ra-r
venna road, heard horses coming j from
1 the villa grounds. From the selvedge ;

â¢\u25a0 palsied with fright,- till the . muffled

and ran, stumbling with fear, "to ; the ,

The former - had . come many "X times

Casa ; Guiccioll. cheated of his dearest
Plan, had haÂ«T recourse 'to *:'\u25a0. the
umbrage of Tuscan officialism. On' this "_
day, as it happened. Trevanion had
been closeted with the police - com
mandant when that official had been :
called ;upoa to vise the passports' s of
two 'strangers: Prince Alavrocordato.
a tall C commanding Greek, and *
slighter, blond-hearted Italian. â¢ at
whose . name the listener had started-^- . \u25a0
with the leap of a plan '\u25a0 to Â£ his brain.
.Trevanion had followed the yountf
Count " Camba : to his hotel, picked ac
quaintance s and. pretending , Ignoranca
of .the other's relationship, had soon -
told him sufficient for his purpose:
that the young and lovely Contessa
Gulccioll, 'lured from Ravenna and hÂ«r
husband, was living at that moment In'
Pisaâ the light-of-love of an English
noble whose excesses In Venice had
given him the appellation of the milord
xnallgno.
The. story had turned -the brother**
blood to fire. All he demanded ( wu
to be shown* the man. .Trevanloa lad
-him to: the palace, where only Fletcher,
hadTnet their entry, and now the open-
Ing of a door had brought this winged
vengeance and Its object face to face. '
The sight 'of her long-absent brother
â Trevanfon behind himâ the pistol th 4
former held leveled at Gordon's, breaic
. âfroze Teresa with sudden comprehen
sion. She stood stock-still. , unablo ; to
utter a word. Trevanion sprang > for
ward, his finger pointing.
"There he Is!" he spat savagely.
"There's your Englishman!"
Gordon had made no ? move.. Â» Un
armed, resistance would have been fu
tile: in presence of the poised weapon.
So this was the way that lurking Nem
esis of his past was to return to htm!
He was looking, not at Trevanion, but
at his companion, fixedly; recalling,
with an odd sensation of the unreal, a
windy lake with that face settling help
lessly in the ripples as he swam toward
it. the water r6aring in his ears. The
outre thought flashed across him how
sane and Just the homlllsts of England
\ would call It that he should meet hlÂ»
end in such Inglorious fashion at / the
bands of this particular; man. 1 :
j"You white-livered fool!"*scoffed Tre
vanion. "Why don't , you shoot?*" r . â
Hl3 companion had paused. ; eying
. Gordon in astounded inquiry. Hla out- ""
stretched arm wavered. ';
The paralysis of Teresa's fear broke
at the instant. She ranto him,' throw-
Ing her. arms around him, snatching at
the handthat held the pistol. .
"Pietro! Pietro!" she screamed. , '.'Ah.
God of love! Hear me, first! Sear
me!"
He thrust her to her knees, and
again, as Trevanion sneered, his arm
stiffened. But the negative of that
r Genevan picture was before 'his eyes,
tooâ its .tones reversed. He saw him
self rising from the beach clasping ,tha
band, of his, rescuerâ heard his owui
voice say: "You have given ma my Ufa;
I: shall never forget it!"
; His arm fell.
-.. "Slgnore," .said Gordon steadily. :.**X

' obligation." \
"Pietro!" Teresa's voice, was choked
with 'agony. ~"lt is not him alone you
would kill! You are aiming at my â¢
V" heart."*. tod!; Pietro!"*
Amazedly, as: she staggered to her :
feet, she saw her brother hurl the pla
,tol> through the open window and cover
his face with his hands.
Trevanion, stared, almost believing
Gordon an adept in some superhuman
diablerie, by which in the moment of
revenge he had robbed this cat's-paw
of courage. Then laughing 'shrilly: and,
wildly, he turned and lurched _ - past
Fletcherâ leaning against the I wall, '
dazed from the blow that had sent him,,
reeling from the- landingâ down the
stair.'-- â¢* . â¢ '
In the street he picked. up the fallen
pistol. "The touch of the cool steel ran
up his arm. He â¢ turned back, a devil-;*;

- before, and failed.- Why not now,- more
boldly? --Italian Justice would make;

A ; sudden memory made his flesh

seen a^jnurderer executed tn Home.
\u25a0- It came back to him as he

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
THE CASTAWAYTHE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL
to Gordon in London. 4 The olerg>-man,
just arrived in Pisa, asked the use of
the ground floor of the- Lanfranchi
Palaceâ tie understood it wasunoccu^
cj ee d â in which to hold service on the
following Sunday. . -
Over the smart of his sorrow the
wraith of a satiric smile touched Gor
don's lips. He. the.unelect and unre
generate, to furnish a tabernacle for
Pisan orthodoxy? The last sermon he
had read was one preached by 'a Lon
don divine and printed in an English
magazine; its text was his drama, of
"Cain," and It held him up to the
world as a denaturalized being, who,
having drained the cup of sensual sin
to Its bitterest' dregs, was resolved in
that apocalypse of blasphemy^ to show
himself a cool, unconcerned fiend.
And vet, after all, thfe request was
naturafenough. The palace that housed
him was the most magnificent In Pisa,
in proportions almost a castle. And, In
fact, the lower floors was empty and un
used. Was he to mar this saner exist
ence, in which he felt waking those
old . jnsDlratlons and ideals, with the
crude spirit of combatlveness. in which
his bruised pride took refuge .when
popular clamor thruÃt him from his
kind? If he refused would not the very
refusal be" made a further weapon
against him? -
Had Gordon seen the mottled clerical
countenance that waited for answer in
the 6treet below he might have read a
partial answer' to this question. ..
Cassidy's ship having anchored at
Leghorn, he had embraced the oppor
tunity to distribute a few . doctrinal
tracts among the English residents of
this near cathedral town. Of Gordon's
life in Pisa he heard before he left the
ship. In the Rev. Dr. Nott he had
found an accidental traveling compan
ion with an eye single to the glory of
the Established Church, who was even
then bemoaning the lack of spiritual
advantages In the town to which hq
was bound. , His zealous soul rejoiced
in the acquaintance and fostered it. on
arrival. The idea of Sabbath service in
English had been the clergyman's; that
of the Lanfranchi Palace as a place
wherein to gather the elect-.had been
Cassidy's. The suggestion was. not
without a certain genius. To the doc
tor's uplifted hands he had remarked
with unction that to ask could do no
harm, and the request, even if refused,
might be precious seed sown. Cassidy
mentally presaged refusal, which should
make text" and material for future dis-:
course of his own.
Waiting at the Lanfranchi entrance
he remembered a sermon of which he
had delivered himself years before at
Newstead Abbeyâ perched upon a ta
ble. He had never forgotten It. He
touched his lips with his, tongue at the
pious thought that he who had then
been master of the abbey â host of that
hare-brained crew who afterward made
him a butt of egregious ridicule in Lon
donâwas now spurned of the righteous.
Gordon at that hour had no thought
of Cassidy, whom he had not seen in
years. "Say to the messenger that Mr.
Nott is very welcome to the use of the
floor," was the answer he gave the
valet.
A moment later Teresa and Count
Pletro Gamba re-entered. Teresa's eyes
were wet and shining. Her brother's
face was calm. He came 1 frankly to
Gordon and held out his hand.
While the two men clasped hands
the naval surgeon was ruminating in
chagrin. Gordon's ' courteous assent
gave him anything but satisfaction.
He took it to Dr. Nott's lodgings.
As Cassidy set foot in the street
again he stopped suddenly and unac
countably. rAt the Lanfranchi portal
in the dusk he had had. a view of a
swarthy face that "roused a persistent,
baffling, memory. The unanticipated
reply to the message he . had carried
had jarrejl the puzzle from his mind.
It recurred again now, and with a sud
den stab of recollection. His teeth shut
together with a snap.
He lay awake half that night. At
sunup he was on his way back to Leg
horn, with a piece of news for the com
mander of the Pylades.
CHAPTER U.
Dr. Nott's Sermon.
It was a thirsty afternoon. Teresa
and Mary Shelleyâ the latter, bonneted
and glovedâ sat at an upper window of
the palace, watching through the Vene
tian blinds the English residents of
Pisa approaching by twos and threes
the entrance below them. :;
Dr. Nott's service had been well ad
vertised, and a pardonable curiosity to
gain a view, . however limited, of the
palace's Interior, swelled the, numbers-
Besides this, one of the Lanfranchi
servants had had an unlucky, fracas
with a police sergeant which, within
a few hours of its occurrence, rumor
had swollen to a formidable and bloody
, affray: Gordon had mortally wounded
two police dragoons and taken refuge
in his house, guarded by bulldogs; he
had been captured after a desperate re
sistance; forty brace :of pistols had
been found in the palace. .These tales
had been soon exploded, but the affair
nevertheless possessed an interest on
this Sunday afternoon.
The pair at the window conversed on
various topics : Pletro, the . new mem
ber of the household, and his rescue in
Lake Geneva, of which Mary had told
Teresa; Prince Mavrocordato. ,7 his
pa.tron, ;'\u25a0} exiled from; Wallachia,
and watching eagerlyHhe plans' of ! the
: primates, now shaping to revolution,
ln Greece, his native country; Shelley's
new sail-boat, the Ariel, anchored at
the riverbank, a stone'B throw from
where they sat. As they.: talked . they
could hear from the adjoining > study
Gordon's voice ' reading aloud' and the
sharp, . eager, explosive tones of Shelley
as he commented or admired. " ,
Both watchers : at . length. fell silent.
The sight of the people below, soberly
f rocked ' and \u25a0 coated, Â»o unmistakably
British in habiliment . and ; "demeanor,
had brought penslve'thougtits to ; Mary
Shelley of the i England and Sabbaths
of .her girlhood. Teresa- was 1 thinking
.of Gordon. . . ' \
Since tha hour tie ; had . learned . that
melancholy, news . from Bagnacavallo
he bad not spoken of Allegra, but there
had been : a" look In his , face ,- that told
how sharply the blow, had pierced.
If there had been a lurking, jealousy
of his past In; which. sho had no part,
it had vanished forever/when he had
told, with that patient pathos that
wrung her, heart: "I .understand." The
words thenj had roused ; in her : some
thing even 'deeper, than the ' maternal
instinct' that had budded when , she
took" him- wounded 'to Casa Guiccioli,
deeper than : the ; utter; joyj with "which
etie had felt i hls f * arms <as' they." rode
through the night from the villa where
he had waked her j from > that deathlike
coma. It was a sense of more intimate
, comprehension â¢ to , which her whole be-,
ing had vibrated ] ever ; since. T
Not but that she was of
Etrugg-les ln him that she did, not fully
grasp.- But : to-day, ,as { she i sat \u25a0 silent
by the. window, her heart was saying :
"His old â¢ life â¢ is I goneâ gone 1 .-;\u25a0 I"^ belong
â¢to his new life.*. Twill" love him 'sol that
he will . forget! \u25a0 We \u25a0. shall : live always
in Italy together,, and Â£he> will; write
poems that the whole world. will: read,
and: some day it will know him as*l
do!".. .. . .. ... : . .: .â,. ; , ; ;;: . /;,.;-\u25a0 w-l ; /<
The sound of a slow hymn. rose from
the floor below, and , Teresa's companion
stole to the hall where th^words came
clearly up the marble \u25a0â \-'yC,
O spirit of the living ,'Gcxi, , \ . ,
In all Thy plenitude of! grace . *,c'j .
Where'er tie loot of man hath trod,
lXsc^nd on our apostate race. '
"As Mary listened," Teresa.' "came and
stood-* .'beside her. -Convent .bred,, re
ligion, to her had; mqaont-churchlngis,
candled processionals and 1: adorations
before the crucifix .which nung'always
above ,her bed.' Her mind direct; ;im7
aginative, yet with a natural freedom
from traditional, constraint, \ suffered
for the home-nurtured " /.ceremony ' : !ef t
behind In her flight with Gordon. But
her new experience retained a| sense; of
devotion deeper because more < prlmlr
tlve and instinctive than these: Â£ a mys
lic leantng out toward : good .; Intelli
gences all about herâ the pure; longing
with which she had framed the prayer
for Gordon so; long ago. She listened
eagerly now,, not only because of the
priestly suggestion . in the sound, but
also from a thought that the -ceremony,
below had been a part of his England.
, This was in her mind as a weighty
voice intoned the opening sentences. : to
drop . presently,; to the recitation of ; the
collect for, the day. â¢ Â«'- : ;
While thus absorbed Gordon j and
Shelley came and leaned with them; at
the top of the \u25a0 stair. The congregation
was responding now to the litany: *\u25a0:
"From all blindness of. heart; from
pride, vainglory and hypocrisy; from
envy, hatred and malice and all .^uri
charitableness, â¢ â¢>\u25a0; *
"Good Lord, deliver us." ;sf? -
It was not alone Mary Shelley, to
whom memories were hastening.^ The
chant recalled to Gordon, with a singu
lar, minute : distinctiness, .; the ' dreary
hours in the-Milbanke pew \u25a0-â¢In; the : - old

The chant died * while . the visitors
said their adieus. \u25a0' The'feeling/of:es

Shelley's fair-haired wife. For a mo

Shelley- looked ruefully at his loose

lowed him to the tent. Beside it the
laborers had heaped a great mass of

a torch and put it into his hands. Gor
don's, fingers shook' as he held It to
the fagots, but he did. the work thor
oughly, .lighting all four corners. Then
he., flung the torch Info the sea,

*~pt MONG the numerous problems
f 1 which concern the parents and
\^\ tn Â« educators of America there
JL is one of peculiar Interest to the
authorities of the secondary or high
schools and the parents whose children
attend or expect to attend such schools.
In fact. It is held by some careful ob
servers of conditions' prevailing in^sec
ondary school life that the most vital
problem of high school life of the pres
ent time is that of high school , frater
nities,'their effect and consequence
upon the public school system of the
United States. It Is of such importance
that investigation of their influence is
being made by authorities; in different
sections of America, ana agitation in
the press for their abolition Is not in
frequent.
T- In order to understand the problem
of high school fraternities-: *aright; a
6hort description of the system is nec
essary.
A high school fraternltj'. is a volun
tary association or, society
for the most part of pupils attending
high school at the - present time or
who have attended In the past,- secret
in character, selecting its membership
according to" standards . arbitrarily
determined by its members,
resembling in Its larger features the
fraternities which exist in colleges
and. universities, and also the frater
nal organizations of adult society,
such as. the Masons, the Elks, the Odd
Fellows, etc.;
Most fraternities have branches lo
cated In different high schools -and
Rcademies. These branches are called
chapters, and usually, contain some
where ; between five ; and i thirty;- mem
bers or even more. - Some fraternities
are merely local, having no connection
with other chapters, = but â¢ existing, in
dependently. Most local fraternities,

"For years I made modelsipf airships
of all sizes, always using;the plane sur
face as other- experimenters wefe doing,
and always falling to solve the problem
of aerial t navigation. .<
"We moved to San Dieso to a ; ranch
there, and I .worked at ranchinsr \u25a0 and.
In all my leisure, hours, in, all the hours
I could spare from other^labors. I tried
to get at the secret of aerial naviga
tion. I: made- model after -model and

of airships. I investigated the relation
of surfaces to the wind and the effect of
wind on * surfaces. found' that wind
has form that is^affected and charised
by the- contact* with or approach' to a
concrete; body. I foundthat'the wincrs
of birds are ;of \yonderful: mechanism
perfectly, adapted- to the? utilisation .of
(he forms of -the^wind,": and sc-, throwing
aside. all the theories^that involved the
plane - surface, I;: have â¢ tripd ito follow
the construction of;the bird's wlngr in
the making of my. airship. V .
"I went to the Aeronautical Congress
that was;held in Chicago "during, the
irigjllttle man c-f priestly cast, who had
come but of California and
unheralded,: was regarded with interest
and;respect and attention by that gath
ering of scientists of world- wide fame.
..-Then 'he came back to ' California,'
buoyed with the conviction that he was
on the right track at last.
"I felt that my theory was; the key
to the problem of aerial navigation.* and
I worked, it out in the. following two
years. It required the nicest? precision
â¢in mathematical calculation^'of course
in conic, sections chiefly.*' . : - ;"-
There were reams and rearris, of flg-
this one Idea^to the exclusion of every r
thing else. It Is, truÂ« that 'all my life
the thought of flying has held a fas
cination for me, the problem of aerial
navigation has interested me beyond
everything else,- and I have worked at
it unremittinglyâ but not at that alone.
I have been interested In \u25a0 mechanics,
in electricity, in astronomy- â -" .
And in astronomy alone Professor
Montgomery's researches and discover
ies and deductions, his contribution to
the sum of knowledge would make of
him a noted man k in the scientific
world if he had not the other day
turned lobse a flying machine ; that
really^ flies and thus overshadowed all
other interests In him.
"I have always been Interested in all
the phenomena of nature. I think that
Is my natural bent of mind. Mv earli
est recollectionâ and it is such an early
recollection that I'm half afraid to tell
you it Is of the time when I was only
three and a half years > oldâ ls of
the curiosity excited by this ,in
terest. The circumstance Is as clear
in my mind as though it were
an occurrence' of yesterday. My
father had taken me with him on a
drive and left me sitting in the rig
while he attended to the business that
had f occasioned the drive. \ While I was
Eittlng there I- observed for the first
time the changing shadows on the sur
face cf the ecrth. When he came back,
I tasked him what made them. Very
kindly and' simply he tried to make
clear i o iriy mind the rotation of the
earth and his explanation suggested a
regularity of movement that must, of
course, produce ;i regularity of effect.
I observed variation, irregularity, and
for years this' phenomenon troubled
my. mind. I was ashamed to tell that
I did not understand, and ask again
for the fuller explanation he would so
gladly have given me." _ â¢
So the little puzzleU child put the
question straight to nature.
And as the child did, to has the man
done â and nature, it seems, has taken
him into her co-nfidence, has imparted
to him her secrets, covertly, indirectly
and again with a free and open hand.
When Telegraph a \L::.:e and Forti
eth street in Oakland was- still part of
a ranch this Myir.g machina that really
Hies was burn in the mind of a boy
playing in the ranch barnyard: not
full-winged, of course; but in the tor
menting form ol a. question.
"When I was a boy of sixteen and we
were living on our ranch at what is
now Telegraph avenue and Fortieth
street in Oakland, I was playing in
the barnyard, as boys will, shying a
piece of tin in the air. Something in
the way it came down, curving and
apparently resting at different points
in the air, arrested my attention^ It '
strdi.\jc me as -weird. *. Why didn't it â¢
come straight down? -Why did it
curve and turn N and settle â seemingly
suspended in midair for an instant?
It struck me as weird â that is the
only word that conveys the impres
sion it made on my mind, and the im
pression remained because it puzzled
me. . . ;
"It is with this incident that I con
nect my first ideas of aerial naviga
tion that .were, more than merely vis
ionary and esthetic,' more than-mere
ly the vague desire to fly."
The same boy on the same Oakland
ranch chasing his - grandmother's
geese into flying from one end of the
ranch to the other, much to the
amazement of the geese and the mys
tification' of the good grandmother, is
another picture in the evolution of
the flying machine that really flies.
o.Vlt' always seemed to me that the
secret of aerial navigation lay in the
discovery of the principle of a bird's
flight â that the successful airship
would not be modeled on the balloon
nor dependent on its buoyancy. The
flying of wild geese interested me in
consequence and as I couldn't get near
iured pages, endless^ problems to be
worked out to the feather-edge of an
.infinitesimal fraction, the air pressure
. and the resistant surfaces to be fitted
to each other to the last hair's breadth,
weary days and long, still nights of
patient labor to be doneâ the long/ dry,,
-dreary road of detail to be traveled.
"I worked.it all out ten years ago,
and laid It aside." t
Ten years ago!
"The principle upon which the Santa
Claraâ the machine we have testedâ
was constructed was formulated ten
years ago. I couldn't go. on with it :
-then, so I had to put It] aside until the
'opportunity for building and testing It
should come." :
\u25a0-- So. after/a lifetime's dreaming and
\ experimenting and Investigating -this
quiet, patient, persistent man went on
-with the urgent, immediate affairs of
,' life with his' triumph In his* pocket, as
\u25a0 It . were.
"How: could you wait?". l asked him.
"Why.* I knew It could be done when
"the time ' came. I had experimented
enough to know the principle was the
right oneâ that it solved the .problem
of.. controlling an airship in the, air." -'.
Scientists are a strange folk, aren't
they? V t . ,
The time did comeâ at last. <
Two years ago Professor Montgomery
began ; again the making of models of
"airships, according to the new plans,
and this time they worked.
Vâ¢ VI went out to Leonard's â my friend
Mr. Leonard's place. We stretched a
cable between two hilltops about a hun
dred feet high, and from this cable we
liberated models of my machine in '
every' conceivable wayâ large models
and smail. with weights In proportion.
They were liberated right side up and
wrong, dropped head first and tail first,
and In ! every instance they, righted
theriiselves in a- .very short distance
and sailed to the earth right side up.
alighting as safely as a bird. The tests
were all encouragingâ satisfactory.
"-"Then came the "test of the large
machine? adapted to a man's weight.
This was the supreme test â for it in
volved the jeopardizing of a human
Ufe." v
;>Perhnps to the purely scientific
mind this would have been a small
. ma tterâ but the willingness of Pro-^
fessor Montgomery to send ud a man
ih his flying machine is the measure
of his. faith in it.
The world knows now -how well
foundad his faith was for the demon
stration" of - its i powers < has been made,
and all the world knows now that. it is,
alflyirig machine that fliesâ yet. there
was a moment when that , faith wa3 se "
yerely- strained.'^
\u25a0 "It was," says Father Bell, "the first
time a man went up In Mt. . The ma
. chine was attached to _ the \ balloon by
ropes, as the basket would be, and.
Maloriey. the man who went up in It.
was sitting 1 in it. of course. The bal
loon, big and ; powerful, gave , a Jerk"
as ~ ! it went up that -snapped off the
wings of- the flying machine. There
was nothing to be done, for the thing
was on Its. way up, and then to add
peril to the situation the balloon struck
a current" that, turned it* over, and If
Maloriey had . tried to cut lobse - he
would have fallen into the balloon to
certain death. He kept his head, the
balloon partly righted itself and Ma
loney found to his \ surprise that, the
machine was supporting ": him even
without its wings and that he was com
ing down more slowly.thanthe balloon.
That- gave- him mow confidence in . it .
v than : he would Have' had without . the
accident, he saysâ but you can Imagine
how Professor Montgbmery/felt! ! With
what. thankfulness he saw him alight."
While "all the world is .watching {or
the Wan ".who will \u25a0 solve the problem ; of
,aÂ«riai;navigatipn; California produces
him; . '^..'1
:-* Prof essor Montgomery Is / a Califor-
' . \u25a0-\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â¢ - \u25a0 -\u25a0 " .
nian/ born here: his father. .Zacharlah.
Montgomery, came across the -plains.,
from Kentucky; so did his _mother?AU :
his life has been spent here: ha was
educated at St.- Ignatius"/ College, and
while he has been working out the
problem that concerns all the, world h^.
has been teaching herÂ« .In .California,'
up . in Humboldt and at â¢ Santa ; Clara
College. ,
With scientific precision and thÂ»^caÂ«-.
tlon of an honesty that will not be ap
plauded more than its 'due, ha says
about his flying machine:
"You must not think that the success
-of these experiments of mlna means
that in a few. weeks or a few months,
or a year, flying machines will be car
rying passengers and 'plying between,
San Francisco and New York and
Paris. v it . means that the problem of
aerlar navigation la solvedâ that the
question of controlling a ; flying ma
chine, of flying in the teeth of the wind,,
wfch the wind or across the wind, la an
swered, that it is no longer a thing at
the mercy of the air currents. Remem
ber, .this machine has to be taken up
from the earth, that it cannot Â» rise of
itself. The problem of lifting it has
yet to be solved, of carrying passen
gers, of making It a utility." AH these'
things cannot* be accomplished at once
nor, perhaps, by one man. It mu3t be *
remembered that the ocean carrier, the _
steamship as we know It to-day, is the -
result of centuries of evolution and Im
provement from the first frail, uncer
tain bark man launched upon t the
watersâ when that bark was controlled
that was the first step in navigating
the waters; this is the first In navigat- -
ing the air." , â¢ â¢
Professor Montgomery's t 3evotion to
an ideaâ from -that- day forty
ago. when his childish hands longed .'to ;
grasp the trailing skirts of the, cloudsâ *
has been- constant and self-sacrificing,
but not entirely Quixotic. ~
. His suits for damages against Cap
tain Baldwin, who ha says appropriated
some of his ideas for the California ArÂ«
\u25a0 row, a balloon with â¢ a propeller, show
that. He will punish treachery and
hold his own.
He recognizes the commercial as well
as the scientific value of his discovery
and invention. "A man would be a
fool," he says, "who would not seek to
benefit by his years of labor such as
mine has been." :
But the real triumph for him Is not â¢
after all in the world's acclaim and the i
money return. There are the friends of
his 'heart whose belief in % hlm will ,ba *
justified, to whom he will justify him
self.
- .Arid there are! gentle regrets that;
some who believed are not here to shara
his triumph. â¢ "f ' :
.Father Neri. who was the head of St. ' \
Ignatius â¢ College when he was a boy
there? who in" his time was a scientist, i
arid who. turned the first electric light
on California, was one of those.
"Father Neri." says Father Bell, who
was also a boy at StT Ignatius then.
"used to "say - again - a nd -again tor thÂ«;
rest of us, 'You'll hear of Montgomery' 1
some day.* He'd have been"; happy tat
â¢have seen his" words come true."
- And there was one nearer : and dear- .
erâ the father whose /sympathy and
understanding are a cherished 'memory.'
ThÂ«re surely Is a great Joy In Â»ucn
an achievement as Prof essor, Montgom

Joy he feelsâ and the only cloud upoa
it is that the dear father coufd^notli
share it. :
Our common notion Is that science la A
dry as dust, yet Inventing a flying ma
chine is not after all a mere matter of
conic sections, you see.
a Â£ V REMEMBER when I was a little
I child in Yuba Cityâ it was when
j[ I was about five years oldâ
watching: with delight the pass
age of clouds across' the sky and
seeing those clouds resting, as It
were, on the mountain tops. I
asked to be taken to the moun
tain tops, because I thought that if
only I could get there I could take hold
cf the clouds and fly; that I could gTasp
them and they would carry me with
them. I think my interest In aerial
navigation dates back to that time."
And to-day the little child, grown to
a manhood with which much of the
child remains, has given to man the
\u25a0wines of a bird, has solved the most
fascinating problem In the world, the
problem of flying.
Man need be no longer an earth
. creeping, earth-keeping thing, envying
the birds of the air. He, too, may
cleave the blue and be no longer at
the mercy of the air currents to be
wafted hither and thither like a bit of
varrast thistledown; he can fly. in the
teeth of the wind, across the wind and
with the wind, as he pleases, thanks to
Professor Montgomery â thanks to that
little child of long ago, whose wonder
ing tyts looked out across the dark
ling Callfornlan canyons, whose poetic
fancy leaped to grasp the fleecy
clooda that paused upon the mountain
tops and go with them on their limit
less flights.
From childhood's radiant dream to
manhood's realization there's been a
long, bard road to travel â the straight,
hot, dusty road of patient endeavor,
pared with error, failure, discourage
ment, the long; long road of detail
conquered step by step, traveled and
retraced and traveled again.
It Is so hard a task to do even the
day's work bravely and honestly; how
had this been possible I asked.
"Ifs not thinking of the road you
come by. but always of the end, that
makes a thing possible. Otherwiseâ*'
and he shook his head.
Such Is the power of an idea.
The professor perched upon one un
comfortable spindling chair and 1 upon
another in the parlor of Santa Clara
College â the unfailingly chill, bare. In
hospitable parlor of the exclusively
masculine habitation.
He Is a rotund, gentle, shy little man
of such monastic aspect that Instinc
tively I called him Father Montgom-
cry. He laughed, a pleased, modestly,
deprecating laugh that gave an upward
curve like unt6 the points of the cres
cent moon to his habitually straight
lipped mouth, a mouth sensitive,
ascetic, compressed, telling: a story of
repression, patience, unwavering pur
pose and sweetest kindliness.
"No," he said, "not "Father'; I'm not
of the order, although people, strang
ers, of ten call me Father and ma*ny let
ters come to me addressed that way â
because I live here, I suppose."
But no, It isn't the background of
Eanta Clara College, nor yet the clean
shaven face that makes "Father" come
trippingly from the tongue.
There is besides a benignity, an
aloofness, lhat steadfastness and re
ceptivity and limpidity of gaze that
never lie In the restless eyes that seek
tha fleeting dollar, and above all there
is the round, full, bald head, the splen
did, dome-like head with its height
chiefly above the ears. It is the Jesuit
ical headâ the distinguishing mark of
the big-brained men who have made
their order powerful. Should. I meet
him on \u25a0 Market street, Instead of In
the cloistered quiet of Santa Clara
College, and he take off his hat to me.
my Impulse BtiU would be to greet him
\u25a0with "Father."-
The world has a right to expect
ecniethicg of a man with a head like
that.

, ''There nw no riasa dlstlncllona in
. the Knlglila of Columbus, either *â¢>-
> cially, niKinclally, rncially or polltjcal*
i !y," emphatically denlos one of the
leading California members, Grand
r State Deputy Joe Scott. "There are
i two .fundamental requisites for mem
j bershlp and any man possessing them
. "Is qualified for admiÃÃlon to the order.
"The first is gc-od, sterling Catholic
1 character of the kind that is not
l ashamed of the faith and that prac
. tlces what It believes.
!/ 'The second Is Intelligence. This la
1 required by reason Of the fact that It
! needs intelligent men to grasp sig
nificance of the ritual, and to enable
them to realize the aims and object.l
1 of the organization and their duties as
' members thereof."
The energies of the Knights of Co
lumbus have not been applied entirely
to. the promotion of the wonderful
growth of their order.
They .arc engaged in broad char
itable and educational 'work. They
have endowed hospital wards and beds
and havf organized lecture bureaus.
They support the poor Italian mission
churches in Philadelphia, ; they con
tribute to the missions for non-
Catholics in Pittsburg. Z- But ' their
most lmoortant, act . so far his been
the endowment of a chair of secular
history in the Catholic University at
Washington, Die. This was done
their national council in April of last
year. ;
â¢ One of- the important features of the
order Is the insurance feature, and
every council ' must" have at .least
twenty-five insurance; -members in
order; to be organfzed:
The order: in California is still prac
tically; an infant, but it Is a lusty In

Who ore these Knights of Columbus
that will swarm herein so many thou
sands that they must have special
trains of many cars to bring them from
alHthepoints of ; the compass? â¢
.â¢Tlibi answer holds a pretty and a
pleasing story.
The order of the Knights ofColum
bus'ia the one secret society in the Ro
man -Catholic church.
. It Is the ,one distinctly American so
ciety In the Roman Catholic church.
The- history of its modest, unpreten
tlous*"lnception \u25a0 and its marvelous
r growth -reads like' a .romance, like . a
fairy, tale.'.';- â¢ .' ,\u25a0 '
The.foundefr of the society; was Rev.
Michael J.KMcGivney.
' Father. : McGivney was a humble, de
vout, priest in a Connecticut towii.iwho
sought .; c-niy â¢ to do .well the work that
lay r.eaiest'to'hls -hand.', '.
.The Connecticut town was New Ha
,ven, the home' of .Yale University,. and
Father McGivney found in the atmos
phere' of the university town so much
of ' materialism iand skepticism and soi
iittleof simple faith and tolerance that
he ' felt the n^ed of. counteracting it.
Tolthat end hie gathered together into
'a little a. group of earnest men'
,who "T. banded':. themselves together , unV
der^his^leadership" forTthe purpose of
; livmg'i? actively' Chriatia n y lives â accords

That ,was_ twehtv-three years 1 ago,
and therewere ' probably : fifty members

that Father McGivney planted UwentyV
three j year's ( , ago ' the Idea grew ; and v
spread/ like a trailing vine of beauty,

The pilgrimage will bo noUblo In
more than mere numbers.
The Knights of Columbus Is the
Krentest and the one dlatlncMy Amer
irnn organization in the Catholic
church. -Its members are chiefly pro
fessional and business menâ doctors,
lawyers, writers, merchants, men "of
intelligence: and cultivation, many of
them men of fortune.
They - are going to make their pil
grimage an excursion de luxe.
They will come on the cushions of
ease, and when they get here the
Knights of CallforniaV.for the honor. of
their State and In the bounty of their
' t hospitality, ;. will j give? them. the time of
their, lives and show them the wonders
to be seen from the Lest vantage
points.
Already ten special trains have been
chartered ; to bring â¢ Knights hereâ ten
trains from as many States, and one of
them Is a' train- of twelve cars.
The special trains, already chartered
will bring the Knights â¢ ,* Massachu
setts,' Connecticut, New York, New Jer
sey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, In
diana,; Illinois and Wisconsin, and
there are Knights to come from every
Statein the- Union except Nevada,
which as yet has: no council.
Just as. a hint of how they will travel,
taMe a look at f the plans for the first
special : train* which will leave Jersey
City -at noon on the last day of May.
The Knights>are to haye -a : daylight

;are tobetakeh In 1 carriages Uoi the Au
ditorluin Hotel* and have luncheon and
'dinner,*., and .find themselves tempora
rily and luxuriously -at home In head
quarters there. â¢ They are to have their
own dining, cars, specially provisioned,
all the way to Los Angeles--and back
again.. When - they / leave' : California
they are to make ' visits ; to Salt Lake

California going to make it worth the<_

here.
Los Angeles, it la true, Will have Ihe

The Knights' of Columbus . are com

.their country, to walk for a little

who carried the cross into the new.

* a!*-â V lOS GRACIAS."
* V"A Pablo Estrada had been
V I J feeling at peace with the
\u25a0~j* ~S vorld all day. He had the
-. â¢ " ' day before sold his season's
dip of, wool; his long morning ride
bene&th a serene autumn Â«un. through
â¢centra. pines,. among the eternal hills,
had, fofj the time, silenced the imperi
ous- arid disquieting call of a thou
sand aboriginal ancestors. And now,
crooning Joy, an opportunity to be
alone with her.
.Asudden bend in the road had re
vealfcd her, walking a short distance
ahead. A young girl In a red gown of
some eoft clinging stuff with many
flounces and white trimmings. Over
o'er *he.ad and about her shoulders a
â¢rfiiite. fascinator was arranged man
tilla-TVifee and the little feet, twinkling
in and out from beneath her skirts,
permitted an occasional glimpae of
dainty red slippers. Heavy pendants
in bÂ«r ears, necklace, bracelets, to
gether with many ribbons, completed
the charming picture. L
.Â§ Pablo touched the flank of his bay
with ia. spur and approached the
xriaiden at a furious gallop, the ends of
the gay ribbon around his sombrero
end the- wide sash about his waist
streaming behind; and when he had
reached her side made a slight move
orient of the bridle rein. The steed
planted his fore feet stiffly before him.
plowed up the earth for a couple of
feet and was motionless. The rider
was on the ground on the instant and
â¢with '_ a 'low bow and a wide down
eweep of the sombrero in his -hand,
exclaimed:
, the Senorita Marcela! At first
I thought it was one of the blessed
angels come to your papa's fiesta."
"Only at first, Eenor Pablo? Then
a. closer look must have shown you
something which is not angelic. I
thank- the Senor for the compliment."
The, 'glorious black eyes sparkled mis
chievously and she dropped hlm::a ; :
mock . courtsey.
y'Surtly," rejoined the* other. "The
angels are so far away that no man
can hope to win one; but you "
"Do you start la 'any of the races?"
asked Marceia quickly.
"In, the chicken race, yes; Just one.
One race for one horse. It Is enough.
l>o ypii'know who else will run?"
."Only^ore. Sam Barrett." She shot
him ar sly. swift glance, then looked
down demurely, with a little smile.
A'.socWl gathered upon Pablo's dark,
handsome, features.
"Diablo! Why do those gringo pigs
crowd In when we, in whose veins runs
the blood of Spanish dons, meet to
gether, to honor our mother country?"/
"Senor Barrett came because he was
invitefl,". was the retort- "It is said he
is a fine caballero and rides the best
bor*e la' the country."
"Nevertheless. I shall beat himâ 01
die," muttered Pablo, grinding his
teeth. "Tell me you hope I may win,*;
eagerly.
,*"My papa hopes the best man and
horse may win." coyly_
.\u25a0.â¢â¢But what do you hope?"
Vrdh, it is not my fiesta."
>V"I will make a bet with you."
"I never bet."
"Allow me to teach you. I will bet
myj heart against yours that I win."
."You- would cheat yourself. Â»Senor
S Pablo; for my friends all say that I
have no heart."
\u25a0>:"Then,to wh&m have you given it?"
"If. you really wish to know"â she
brought'- her face near his ear and

Then he and his companion tarcrSl the !
ccol chade of the wood, winding about
to avoid an occasional copse of under
brush, and soon were mingling v.ith
the crowd. Â»
They were approached by a tall, wiry
built American, whose features had
been tanned by the sun to almost tÂ»e
swarthiness of those about him, and
who wore a bardana for a neck scarf.
"Geod-mornin*. Miss Moreno. Kin I
have the pleasure of this dance? It's

Pablo inwardly cursed his stupidity
in not having foreseen and guarded
against this contingency.
"MeeÃter Bart, thees lady,, iha's
leading me to her papa," and he hoped
Marcela would bear him out in' his fib.
"Oh, that> all right, Estrada, I'll hire
some feller fur to
lead youâ that is, if *
you haf to be led,"
he added, as if as'
an afterthought.
The hot, blood
reddened Pablo's
face.
"To-day. Meester
Bart will foller
where I lead," he
cried fiercely. . ',,.-.;'
Marcela had been
standing in evident
vacillation. But a
furtive peep had
shown her the
thunder cloud on
Pablo's face, and her feminine soul
laughed. Turning, she placed a light
hand on Barrett's arm, and Pablo' was
left alone:
He watched the pair step on the
wooden dancing platform laid between
the trees and begin to whirl in time '
to th/> music of the two violins and
guitar. But It was torture to see the
arm of Barrett encircling the slender
waist of Marcela. He turned a\\;ay
with a muttered oath and walked to
a large barrel which stood against a
tree. Seizing a cup which hung In
vitingly near he dipped and quaffed a
heroic portion of wine. :
A sound thump upon the back start
led him and he became aware -that
the host of the day, /Senor Moreno,
Marcela'a father, ' was . beaming down
upon hlnv < <â¢ ' \u25a0
"Eh, Pablo, boy, that was to some
Kenorita surely. Now fill again and
drink to me. Do not spare it. If the
barrel becomes empty there is another
one or two where it. came from.
What a grand aenor he is "this day!
I must see all the girls and tell them
to look out for Pablo Estrada, the
heart breaker."
"Senor Moreno," blurted, the young
man, "why are all these gringos here?
The pigs are not content with taking
our country from us, but they must
corns and take ourâ our celebratiens '\u25a0
too." He had intended to say â¢'senor-
Uas," but, considering to whom he was
speaking, Judged It. more; politic to'
make the substitution. Instantly the
old saan' ; drew himself up haughtily.
"Senor Estrada, these A!mericarios
are my guests. The guests of a Mo
reno are sacred. Who slights them' in
sults me."
"Then consider that I have riot
spoken ; slightingly," : apologized Pablo, :'
with the deference which' youngYmen
usually pay their eldersâ who have
marriageable daughters. "Yet : I curse
, the day when the ' dirty; gold was : first
picked '_ from ;: California's . streams to
attract the greedy foreigners,".;

at him in passing, but Marcela jap

It was not until two â hours had
elapsed that the crowds deserted the
tables, to pass the remainder of tha
delightful day ,as fancy ' suggested.
Black bottles passed back and forth;
dice and card games sprang up; heat

tion played at least a3 Important a
part 'as words. "What if the fun grew

The afternoon was . drawing to a
close when r Pablo and Marcela made
-the ~ ascent of. the pine covered hill
which stabbed into the valley just be-"
yond the grove. Pablo had been al
ternating between heaven and hell all
the afternoon and was at present In
the abode of bliss. As he looked at
the girl, glowing with the animation
of physical exercise, a mighty wave
of passionate longing swept away bis
timidity and he- cried: â¢
"Oh, Marcela! Marcela!"
Two pink spots appeared on Max
cela's. cheeks. She said nervously:
"See. the sun sets behind '\u25a0 Santa
Lucia and bid 3 farewell to Mexico
day."
"But tell me, dearest, does my sun
set. or is it -to rise and shine while
life lasts?"
"I did not know that the Senor
Pablo owned a sun," and her vole*
betrayed surprise. -
"Marcela. you know what It jis In
my mind and heart I wish to ' say."
"How could I know except by magic
and the padre says magic is. from the
Senor Devil."
"Marcela, I pluck} this bunch \of
Christmas berries; I 'give them to you.
If you pin them to your bosom I shall
. know that the love I offer is returned."
"Ah. you offer me your love?" quer
ieS tho maiden, with a great show of
ingenuousness. Then her face became
grave and she added seriously: "I
must think, Pablo. 'think. Leave me
now â leave Â«me alone, and when I have
decided I shall let you know."
"But tell me first you are not in
doubt as between myself and j that
gringo."
A gay smile broke over .her, fea
tures. "What fools men are! Now
go." ByCTHjffijggS " '
As Pablo slowly descended the hill .
he heard the sounds of voices ahead of
him and. looking up saw Sam Barrett
and a companion approaching. > Evi
dently they had been down to the spot
where a gringo from Salinas had. been
coining money-all day dealing- "stud j
horse" poker.
" Pablo wanted no trouble at present,
"us his fate" might be decided at any
moment,- and he did not wish to meet
. Barsttt ;.withbut having trouble, so he
stepped .behind a bush. Then he heard
an exclamation from his rival: -
"Byjings, thar's " my gal. a-top that*
â¢ar hill. You Jest mosey on, Bill; I'll
see you later."
"Sure it's your gal. eh?., l "low Pablo

. "Now mark my words. BllL .If that

"Well, s'long. Invite me to the wed*

"Ain't goin' to be no weddin',7 -was
the reply, followed by a " wink. Hla
companion walked off and Barrett took
a few steps toward the hill.'; 'when
suddenly; he* was confronted by a devil
incarnate. .- " ..
"No more. J'u one walk more makÂ»
to thees lady an* I feex you."
"Helendamnatlon ! You sneakln" ; In
jun! I'll settle you plenty right ncrwr."
The American aimed a biow^ with his
flst, which was dodged. Then Pablo's
right arm swune : out. â¢ .There < was a
"flash of steel and the nex*Â»instant his
enemy was prostrate at his faÂ«t- .
For a moment he gazed at the suplnÂ»
form -with only an animal . feeling of.
satisfaction- over gratified revenue.
Then, a sudden realization of thÂ»
gravity of his act ., struck him like ' â¢>
blow. ; From .the picnic grounds thÂ©
-' sounds of song . and laughter reached
his 'ears, and he felt that those pÂ«ople,
so lately, his brothers and sisters, were
so no longer. From this , time on,
while - life ' lasted, he would > have no
fellowship with : them. He was as one
apart, separated from his ! kind â¢by a*
sinister crimson gulf. ; And .what *lf
they should lay hands. upon him? H<Â§
would ba haled before a grln?o Judsa

JOTTINGS OF OLD LIM JUCKLIN
ON SHAKESPEARE
OPIE
READ
]T was a ginger cake and elder social
at the. house of Limuel Jucklin.
Miss Pauline Ralney had sung
something which, as It was whis
pered about, had come, out of a. grand
opera, and the minister had told a story
which might have come out of the ark,
when Josh Dolittle remarked: "Uncle
Llm, on several occasions we have heard
you mention a feller named Shakes
peare. I; take it he lived a eood deal
before our time â was a circuit jedee,
mebby ; and we'd like for , you to j tell
us a little somethin* about him. bein" as
he must have'been one of the early set
tlers."
"Oh, please do," cried Dollttle's sister,
an oldish girl" who had begun to "re
spruce" herself since the death of the
minister's wife.
Old Limuel smiled. "Yes." he said*.
"Shakespeare was an early settler. He
was one of the earliest ones to settle
the fact that the grandest thoughts of
man and the strongest passions of the
world had been set forth (in words.
Shakespeare was a poet.'.'
"You don't v say so?" replied Do
little, with his mouth remaining^ half
open,. as If it were not in good keeping
. to close it so soon upon his own aston
ishment. ~'.-.>"f
"Yes. sir, a poet," said Lim. 'And his
book Is next to the Bible."
The minister, with his head turned
toward Miss Dolittle, slowly nodded
an agreement to this Judgment: and old
Mrs. Benson- remarked: "Well. I didn't
know that. Te.ll me about it."
"Owned a good deal of land. I reck
on," observed Jim Daggart, who held
mortgages (on "the domains of several
of his neighbors.
"Oh, yes," Lim replied. 'He owned
all the land there wasâ and all" of the
sea; and the stars paid'' rent to him,
for they lived In his territory." .
"Well, I wouldn't say that," sald.the
minister; and Miss Dolittle remarked.
"Oh, no, 1,- wouldn't say that" \u25a0â¢ :\u25a0\u25a0'; .
"I don't say it profanely," . replied
Limuel. "It was a figure 'pf. speech.
But a figure of speech may.Jiave; truth
in^it. ..yhejuriiverse Is no ejc^ater..jthan
the "human heart. And ofitheihuman
heart, Shakespeare was the 'â¢
tial friend. As soon as a thought^wa's
bom anywhere 1 in the world, he knew:
it. He was the nurse of ideas. Hq'
said . things that hundreds of people
had already thought,, but which had
lain dumb, in their souls. He also
knew things that were goln* to be
said "in the 1 future and said 'em. It
didn't make any difference to him that
he .was livin'.away back in the past.
Why, for him, there wan* t any past
and no future. With him all was the
eternal now."
"Well; Just think of that," said JSss
Dolittle, looking at the preacher.
"Bet they sent him to the Legisla
ture every time he wanted to go," de
clared Daggart.
"Well, "as to that I believe he did get
to be a Justice of the Peace or some
thin' of, the "-sort," said Lim. "But
money. was as powerful then as it is
nowâ the average man was Just as
short of -sight," 'and wisdom* cried out
in the street and -no man; took heed.'
In this respect /_ the (., worldv : hasn't
changed. Why^, there were men. that
nobody has heard 1 of since. that tlme--^'
men with a few. thousands, "(with titles
and ribbons tied l (about, their shanks-^

poet If they had met hlni in the post
office, and a man* that won't spe^k* to
you in thepostofflce has got ypu-down
\u25a0putty far underneath his contempt. 1
The folks that saw Shakespeare every;
day didn't think he , was "great. .( The
fact vis that the oftener they saw. him.
the less great he was. He built a play
house for the children of men and ; he;
wrote down things for the children
to say, and . the puff ed-up chaps : that
come to the playhouse 'lowed, 'Well;
yes, that . will dv putty wellâ for the
sort.' They didn't know that the sort
was for . all time. Proud .men (.were
a-thunderln* _In the churches where
there, were gold candlesticks and books
bound'in silver and set with diamonds.
But these proud and educated men
didn't know that the Lord's inspiration
had found; its way to that playhouse
where common folks stood up;to"lis
ten. ,\u25a0 The men that sat down (were {lie
rich." And when they had heard they
forgot, but the words spoken by.'the
children of men : that were(playin"jre
mained in the, minds and f the 'hearts
of, the poor/ Ah, and^.no; man /that

A TROUSSEAU FOR "T.P.M."
Keith Gordon
(Copyright, 1904, by Keith Gordon.)
JLrW ISS VAN s ORDEN halted and
/\ / 1 regarded .the display In , the
V.'T I .windows of Berg & Co. with
,J^ kindling eyes. There, really
was" no excuse for " her to
linger at that " particular wiridow, for
Berg & Co., as everybody, knows,- are
haberdashers, and Miss' Van Orden was
fatherless, brother less and unmarried.'
"Talk about women's clothes,".. ran
her thoughts as she reluctantly pre
pared to- move onward. "Why, there
Isn't a window in town that compares
with this for charm. Dresses-^-ugh!
Ruffles, tucks, pleats, French knots
and fussiness. But thisâ it's a poem!
Just imagine some big creature In that
pink bathrobe or"â . - /\:
With a silent laugh she caught her
lip between her teeth and moved down
the street. toward the dry goods shops.
But the (windows appeared' cheap,
overloaded and tawdry.' Berg's store,*
with its ~ display of masculine attire
whose severity sometimes verged; Just
near enough to softness and beauty, to
be fascinating, kept, rising before : her
eyes, and almost automatically she re
traced her steps In that direction.
By the time she again reached , Berg
& Co.'s she had an idea that made, her
giggle, (though her eyes were bright
and her cheeks went pink. Some girls,
she reflected, hoarded china'and.sil
ver, others ; ilnen, and Btill .others old
mahogany against the day .when "time
and chance" "should bring .the. man
whom they all , confidently ( expected.

one of the counters reassured -her; and

with an ease and assurance that might
have been* acquired !by years of shop

"What" size ?!'/asked the clerk, when, ;
after much hesitation . betwen V a pink
and a blue one,' she had finally % decided
on the , former.
At the- question she stared* at hlria
in blank ariiazement. "That 'is, how
tall is he?'.'; he i went ' on,., judging from
her look - that she ?. failed Â«under

Conscience is more a matter of di-
Sreetlon , than of any scheme of moral
rectitude.'
Integrity and honesty depend more
upon a satisfied / stomach . than upon
Sunday-school teaching. jA man: is
moral and honest just as ionp'as he
has everything he" wants ajÂ»d' his stonu
Â«eh is obedient to his -. will." The mo

the outer orYeal-collar excellently and
will entirely relieve '.- that bedraggled
look which a crushed and wilted cpllar
cqnveys. This ought to be borne in
mind, as it means a great deal to the
summer girl to have her neck look
neat, and soft collars will not stay up
very well in the hot weather.
Turnover collars this year are very
much embroidered, and the favorites
seem to be those with the. VMont Mel
lick" embroidery. This particular era
broidery Is very effective, as it is heavy
and stands. out in relief on the Hntfl.
Our illustration of the big turnovor
collar is a photograph of -one of the
daintiest, collars I have seen this sea
son. The. top is made of very thin
linen, with embroidered flowers . and
buttonholes â and the bottom is knife
plaited lawn edged with lace. On a
line French waist it has a very dainty
appearance. A very good material to
use for making collars is a beautiful
and heavy quality of old Irish bleached
round thread linen, which takes the
embroidery so well that the collar will
look very handsome. Collars are often

give an untidy ', and ' shiftless effect.

ore made of all kinds of material and
iruall. kinds of shapes. I have seen'a
great' many suits this year with pique
\u25a0\u25a0; collars and cuffs, the latter quite
broad and plain, turning back off the
hand. -Certain walking suits that " I
Â» have ; seen" made of - a pepper. and * salt
; gray, cut, quite short in the skirt, with
" a plain and long tailor-made coat and
. finished with white pique collars and
'cuffs .attached, by buttons,' are very
'smart: indeed. The "advantage of the
. buttons'is that a change can easily be
.made.

linen turnover collars, which are gen
. erally embroidered at each corner, but
* toned over with two fancy buttons or
etuds. The studs are frequently tur
quoise. These collars are often worn
\u25a0with chiffon and thin fluffy waists, pro
ducing an effect that is hot only soft
and pretty, but very smart.
This' year the "Buster Brown" collar
will be worn a great deal. It may be
either soft or starched, and is a low
and broad turnover collar that is very
. becoming on a neck that is not too
large. It must, however, be worn with
i>a tie of -some kind, preferably with, a'
email, soft, silk four-in-hand, with a
very small knot. Stocks have gone out
of fashion entirely. The "summer girl"
of to-day. is no longer a mannish girl,
\u25a0with sleeves rolled up. heavy walking
chores and a man's stock. This year she
is quite a dainty, pink and white and
Frenchy girlâ all tucks and ruffles, with
lace and lace ruches. In the morning
her dress should be a short ljnenÂ» or
duck dress, toned and softened and or
namented with pretty embroidered col
lar, cuffs and~ belt. In the afternoon
she arrays herself in lawn or organdie,
with the softest neckwear she can find.
She also wears a lace hat and carries
a dainty parasol to keep her little white
neck front â¢ tanning. In short, the
American summer girl is no longer the
"Gibson girl," but the "Wenzel girl,"
and I. for one. am very glad of it. It
is such a pleasure to have pretty, dain
ty things of lace.
-With some of the soft collars it may
be necessary to wear an under-collar-
An extremely nice under-collar is one
called . the "Phyllis," .which is made of
mousseline de sole and featherbone. It
is very thin. Invisible and will hold up
OTHER things may in an emer
gency be silghted, but to a be
coming summer costume appro
priate collars, cuffs and belts are
Absolutely essential. It is upon this
'subject that I propose to write to-day.
â¢ j Quantity is as important, too, as
â¢Quality, because collars wilting and
drooping: under the summer heat and
iumbled cuffs looking as if they were
two days old will go far toward spoil
* ing the appearance of, any costume.
On the other hand, a quite plain and
unpretentious costume may be re
deemed by these important parts of it.
c .For example, a perfectly simple dress
* .'of 'linen or duck will be made to appear
* not only appropriate, but really attrac
'â¢ tive and stylish by embroidered col
â¢lar, cuffs and belt, all to match, and
dHat. too. "at very little expense and al
most no trouble. Of course, some of
* t these sets are costly, but the question
occurs to me. Why should we have to
purchase what we can make ourselves?
.And many young ladies nowadays do
* make them, and the result is. of
'< course, cheaper, frequently prettier
]â and almost always more appropriate
results than can be found in the shops.
. Â»TJi* art. of making French knots isa
valuable accomplishment. Nothing
â¢ looks neater or effective than
â¢ French knots, and if you know how to
â¢ snake them you Fhould begin at once
<. to prepare your sets for the summer.
o Please bear in mind that it is abso
lutely decreed this year that sets must
matchâ that is, the belt, the collar and
â¢ the cuffs must all be of the same de
sign. In one of the illustrations the
design is of French dots and fleurs-de
lis, and the result is a very attractive
-> s*t for an outing suit. This set was
sent to me by a very fashionable New
York society woman, who has just re
turned from Paris and therefore quite
up to date. You will notice that even
the buckle Is covered with white linen.
â Collars.
â¢ So many styles of collars are now
Vorn that a great deal may fee said
about them, whether of stiff or soft col
lan or of high or low collars â but the
. fashion this year is unquestionably to
have every article of dress soft and
fluffy, which no doubt is very generally .
â¢ becoming. Many shirt waists this year
are made with regular collars of lace or
embroidery to match the waist, and
1 with a little niche of lace at the top.
I But with plainer and every day waists
the collar must generally be supplied.
White Is always in good taste and al
ways washes better than color. â¢ In
France it is the fashion to wear stiff
Belts of all kinds and descriptions
will be worn this year, but it must tm
borne in mind that a belt Is not mere
ly an accessory, but is really an im
portant feature of a complete costume.
The variety of belts is somewhat be
wildering, but a choice must be made
with reference not only to the dress,
but also to the figure. To go into par
ticulars, which are perhaps already ac
cepted principles, a high girdle should
not be placed on a stout figure, because
the size of the waist Is thereby ac
centuated, and It should also be avoid
ed by a very thin, person, because.it
presents a somewhat "lathy" appear
ance. This year the fashion of belts la
\u25a0very high in the back, sloping grace
; Wly down to the front, where" the belt
U gathered in by some sort of effective
buckle, according to the taste of , the
wearer. I saw an exceedingly pretty
one the other day. which was made of
white silk, fan-plaited at the back, the
plaits gathered In the center and held
"by a rosette. The sides were shirred
and the ends were brought round to
the : front, where they were held by a
long buckle. A belt of this kind is In
tended to be worn -with a white slllc
waist or. suit. White leather belts ara
still being worn a great deal. They are
always' considered pretty and they are
certainly convenient and available, be
cause they can : be .worn with all sorts
of .gowns. .They are shaped this year
more than last and are now quite high
!n the -back, tapering down in the front
to the size of the buckle. \u25a0' For; summer
wear "and for use in the country tha
really proper thing is the linen belt,
which can be very elaborately or very
simply made. In the matter . of > these
linen belts they can easily be made at
home, whereas ". they are expensive to>
buy, a~*considerable portion of the Co3t
being for the style of them.
The directions are simple enough.
For a pLIn linen belt, cut a strip of
linen about six Inches wide and make
a narrow ' hem ; at the top and bottom
of it. At one end of it work three or
four small round button-holes and
' turn Uhe edges neatly into a point. At
tach'a pretty buckle at the other end.
andHhe belt is finished. Toelaborata
this belt it will be easy to Insert medal
lions of lace or embroidery in the back
and the effect "is charming. A very
good "straight front" girdle, fastening
ing ! In the back, can be. made of' Soft
liberty satin cut on the bias and eight
inetoes in width. Attach a piece of
bonecaslng down the center two
inches, shorter "than the satin ' and in
sert * a iwhalebone. . Then lay the satin
in soft folds and tack firmly to ; thÂ»
bonecasing. At the back. turn the ends
lnand gather about half an Inch from
each end, thus making ; a , little head-
Ing for. a finish. Then sew on bone
casing, .also two. Inches shorter than
ihe* satin, next to the gathering, and
insert â¢ whalebone. Sew the hooks and
eyes on ;the bonecasing. When hooked s
together the" two gathered ends will.

leather. ,but ; this does not seem to me
to bo at' all attractive, but.on the con
trary* a "very ,bad* combination.-- It is
apparently an effort to find something
new. which is most. likely to prove a
failure.
Now again I lay stress upon the fact:
thatjthe belt; or girdle is in ; reality, an
- essential partof any costume and must
betmade or; selected with" as much care
and attention to the dress and to the
figure 'as any" other part of the en

very beautiful and extremely rich look
ing, but th**y are. of course, so costly
as not to be lightly considered. TbÂ»
combination of whit* linen and Irish
lace is a particularly elective one. Oa
dark shirt waist suÂ«ta perfectly plain
turnover collars and cuffs should bÂ«
â¢worn- The \ effect -is more that of %
tailor-made suit. This style of suit ia
purely American. French, women
â¢would scorn to wear any.'sarb so sim
ple-and so severe. They rarely \u25a0wear
thÂ« short skirt, but greatly prefer a
long, fluffy, skirt, which can be held up
with the hand, to display tbo mysteri
ous lacy ruffles of the ling-erle beneath.
A French lady told me in Paris that
\u25a0when she first encountered the Ameri
can women on Fifth avenue in Not*
Tcrk she came to the conclusion that
they were all clad in some kind of unN
form!
There is but little more now to B*f,
on the subject of cuffs, particularly be
cause the short elbow sleeves are Tery
much worn this year. "What may b*
called the elbow cuff is In reality not
exactly a cuff, but onlya finish .to thÂ«
sleeve, which extends only to a point a
little below the elbow. It appears to
be a broad turn-back cuff which flares
out at the top and fits snugly at thai
bottom. !-'
For mourning collars and cuffs must
be made of white organdie of the best
quality, with a half-Inch hem all
around, showing the black of the dress
through the diaphanous * material of
the cuff.

THE STORY OF
FASHIONSis very pleasant Somehow .or other,
summer puddings and pies seem too
heavyi and ices, while delicious, are
very apt to grow a bit tiresome.
So why not use fruit? It is always
pleasant to look -upon and it is always
palatable, and It is a most grateful
change from the ordinary stereotyped
order of things. Costly? No, , not
when you understand how to make the
most of it, and if you are able to con
coct a delicious meringue and use up
all the odds and ends for a salad you'
certainly are coming out ahead of the
game. ,
So, for the sake. of economy, try the
following recipes and see whether you
get the full worth of your money or
not. I rather fancy the family-will

Somebody- once said that -the begin
ning and. the end of a dinner were the
most important parts, as people had
more time to think and to criticise
what- they. were eating. -c.\:.
I- don't know about the first, but I'm
perfectly positive , about the latter,- for
ft pretty dessert served in an acceptable
manner gives a lasting, impression that
The housewife knows this and ehe
even goes as far as walking to the
stalls and inquiring -the- price- of
rhubarb, asparagus "knd peas. Expen
sive. . . Unfortunately, . yes, and she
shakes her head and thinks that, it
would : be a foolish waste of money,
"especially with meat so high.
Now, I know that fruit and vege
tables, are expensive, but they are
wholesome and nutritions and. ft cer
tainly is better to pay a few extra
.pennies to the market- man than it is
to the : doctor. In fact, \u25a0 living on a
steady aneat diet is about the same
kiud of economy that turns off the
heat from every room, save, the living
room in winter and that turns the"
lights so low that the eyes are strained
nearly out of the h^ad to see.
.Economy is all right in its place, but
it certainly does not begin with the
necessities of life. Wholesome living
is real economy in the long run and
it is the sort of saving that insists cm
getting full value for every dollar ex-,
pended.
Certainly lettuce, spinach, radishes
.and beet greens axe inexpensive and
there are quantities of oranges, ban
anas and pineapples to be had for a
few pennies. Yet how many cooks
place, some one of the onion family on
the table every day and heap the fruit
dish full to overflowing?.
-The. ltalians were the ones who made
it their business, to .see how much they
could do with next door to nothing. A
piece of fish stewed with a clove' of
"garlic or a rump steak served in* the
same fashion costs only a few cents
and is a decided change from roasts
and heavy - meats- and there is- some
hopes of adding- relishes and extra
luxuries. But remember, that cooking .
inferior .meat and fish and dressing it
tip, with garlic does not mean. to use it
freely and on all occasions. Garlic,', to
be nice, must be used very carefully
ana sparingly; for its chief charm
lies, in the fact that Its identification
Is almost impossible. It is quite enough
to rub a hc-t platter with a clove or to
rub a piece of bread and toss it among
the lettuce leaves', for a. delicate flavor
is acquired" 'and nine out of ten people
would never dream that they were eat
ing lettuce or steak flavored ' with ob
noxious garlic .
Plebeian. Well, perhaps it Is. but it's
delicious just the same and what you
don't knew won't hurt you In, the least.
.>.And one \hing more I want to- tell
you of before I go to the fruits. An
other-Italian dish, as it chances, but a
mighty toothsome one and the pride
of the \u25a0 frugal Italian, as well. \u25a0 The
foundation is vegetable and the top
and .dressing is .cheese, so that It is
somewhat of a combination dish. â¢'
Use cauliflower, artichokes, celery,
tomatoes/ sprouts, cabbage or macaroni
and cook and sprinkle It with; cheese,
and trim it with lettuce and cucumbers
and see how nicely.it will answer the
purpose of meat. In fact, any dish
served with creamed cheese sauce, is
always" a pleasant surprise and. It; is
more filling than you would at ' first
suppose.
Now, don't raise any objection, to
cheeEe immediately and say. that It
doesn't agree with you, for these days
there are so. many different kinds that
any one can eat it if cooked to a proper
turn. . - . \u25a0 ya^JMMJytfL' ' .-. .
It Is only natural to long for a change
in diet when the early days of spring
tome along. The crispness and cool
ness of winter are gone and the heavy
meats and puddings that seemed a part
of winter cheer are "not appealing to the
appetite or the *ye any longer. Sorhe
<hing green is what is longed for.
Something, 'in fact that tastes of the
earth and that looks as though it had
never known the meaning of the word
winter. â¢ -C_'-Â« '*.'
Â£ >*7V 3f "*" Wngdom -for something
/\ /1/ 1 good to eat," Eighs the
Iy I housewife, and then
. | promptly figures out that
she I ' simply cannot afford
the newest and the latest vegetables
andTruits that the market affords.
' This may be economy, but to - toy
way of thinking it is false and it is the
very thing that makes the entire fam
ily hate the very sound of the word
and .that keeps them all mighty un
happy and miserable trying to prac
tice it. K3B

at the hands of. Japan. The Czar also
telegraphed to Father John of Kron
ctadt asking the priest to compose spe-*
cial prayers for the victory of the Rus

telegraphed to the Archbishop of Mos

OFFICIAL, PILGRIMAGE.
The belief in the miraculous power
Df the remains of the dead saint is
chared by the Emperor of Russia as
\u25a0well as by many other high personages
et the Russian court. After the Czar
had been disappointed by the birth of
two or three daughters instead of the
eon whom he so ardently desired, it.
*vas suggested to him that St. Serafin
might possess the power not only of
procuring children for childless parents,
but also of presenting a son to fathers
end mothers who had only 'daughters.
The Czar welcomed the idea and be-
Kan to pay homage at the shrine of St.
Serafln with the intention of gaining
the favor of the dead saint. At first
the Czar paid homage by proxy.
The Czar's visit to Sarafsbaya, where
rest the bones of the saint, took place
on July SI, 1904, and on August 12 the
Czarina gave birth to the long-desired
eon and heir. St Serafin was imme
diately acclaimed as the benefactor of
the dynasty and of the Empire.
The suggestion that St. Serafin's in
tervention in the war with Japan might
be brought about with equal success
was made to the Czar some time ago.
In view of. the fact that St. Serafln
was able to determine the sex of the
imperial baby it is thought by many
devout Russians that the saintly bones
might Just as easily determine the
fortune of war and check the triumph
ant progress of the Japanese army in
Manchuria. This idea was welcomed
by -the Czar, who has recently become
the victim of a mild form of religious
mania.
BRINGS CZAR AX HEER.
ST. PETERSBURG. May 6. â It was
renounced to-day that the Czar has
tiedded to make a -pilgrimage to the
fcomb of St. Serafin, at " Sarafsbaya,
â¢ iwlth the object of imploring thÂ» saint's
|>ones to save the Russian army In
Manchuria from defeat- No date has
g^et been set for this devout journey.
Â£t- Serafin, alhough unknown to the
outside world, is a great power in
(Russia, notwithstanding the fact that
tie has been dead for two centuries,
geraftn was & priest, who lived at
Earoff at the end of the seventeenth
fcentury. and acquired a great repu
tation for miraculous achievements.
The ignorant and superstitious popu
lation of Russia believed implicitly in
fcis power of healing diseases and
working wonders, and in the course
of years his home at Saroff became the
destination of thousands of credulous
pilgrims.
The Czar of his time, Alexnnder I,
wisited the priest at Saroff and asked
his prayers for the empire. After his
ideath Serafln was canonized and came
to be regarded as one of the most" im
portant of the patron saints of. the
orthodox Greek church in Russia. His
Cead body is reputed to possess mirac-;
Hlous power, and" in the "course of the
last two centuries hundreds of thous
ands of pilgrims have visited his tomb
in the ancient monastery of Sarafs
baya. St. Serafin's tomb is visited more
particularly by ' parents to whom
children have been denied and there
is a general belief in Russia that the
'dead saint has caused childless women
to become mothers.

s ceiving the message from him and to
I give him the assurance that the mem

WHICH HE DEMONSTRATES HIS WORTHINESS TO BE CXASSEU AiIO.NU
â¢ THE BEST. MEN OF HIS LINE IN THE WEST.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
The recent utterances of Sir Caspar
Purdon Clarke, the newly elected di
ector of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, have made the thoughtful among
American artists double up on their
thinking. .
He has even made the artists out
here in the West do a little quick
mental work, and what do you sup
pose it can be?"
It's all about their drawing â the
basis of worthy work. '
Now. here is what hits "hard in San
Francisco.
A sense of color Western artists
possess, a deep sympathy and. under-
Btanding. besides vast virility and
originality of presentments But as for
drawingâ well, herein He's their sin.
And this is not surprising to those
who share with the artist his ecstasy
and sense of Intoxication when seized
with a desire to put on canvas a bit
of landscape,' or an arresting figure.
He sees the thing in color, and he
is not schooled â the most of him isn't
â to stair his impetuous paint-brush
until he has done his drawing to the

DEnCIENCY IN DRAWING IS THE SIN 0f THE WEST
for six weeks in a modern play, 'Fools
of Nature.' But people somehow did
not care for me in that kind of thing,
and I did not care for myself. ' I have
always done the picturesque, primitive
sort of thing; dealt with the larger, or
at least more freely-manifested emo
tions.''
"Have you ever played in the 'Antig
one?" I asked. â¢ .
"Howâ you â¢ are rather surprising,"
Miss Marlowe had for this.- "No, I
have, not played Antigone. But I have
always wished- to -play the part, and â
this will amuse you â whenever I want
to look very noble on the stage I al
ways think of Antigone!" %
Were there any of the modern plays
that Miss Marlowe \u25a0found. 'grateful, 'any.
of the Ibsen plays in particular?
""The Doll's House,' " she replied
without hesitation, "Nora,* I should
much enjoy trying. I've never wanted
to play 'Hedda Gaoler,'' I must con
fess," and generally Miss Marlowe de
plored the essential lack of beauty in
the Ibsen genre. . Magda, Mrs. . Wood
ward reminded her that she had al
ways liked, and the actress eagerly as-:
sented to this. Another of the,Suder
mann plays, new, "Johannls"â l be
lieve, she mentioned, and Hauptmann's
"Sunken Bell."
."But I rarely see modern plays, read
modern books," continued Miss Mar
lowe, who has one of the finest-li
braries, most exhaustively read,
among the actor folk. She- explained;
"I am too busy. .Take these Shake
spearean productions. We, Mr. Soth
ern and I, mark even the emphasis in
every line of every small part right
throughout the cast. One must, to
get the ensemble; one must to -make
things converge. to an effective center,'
to have every' actor working toward
the high lights"'' of the story, *so to
speak, to have each oneâ say where
Beatrice leadsâ led to help her scene.'.'
Not the skillfullest actor, she de
cided then,; but the* most pliable, is
the most useful in minor roles. "As
you know,"' her white hand weaving
effective illustration, "as a/piece of
furniture too fine for a room stands
out ' unpleasantly,; so will too big an
actor in a too small part. 7The effect
is crooked, things get on the- bias.
One can easily imagine. aY personality
too potent- to fit into a small role. You
don't often get it," the eyes twinkled
quizzically, "they commonly rattle
around in the parts.'*
I wondered if the greatest men
could not most successfully obscure
their personalities. Not so,' Miss Mar
lowe decided. Henry Irving came up
apropos of this. Three churchmen.
Miss Marlowe said she had 'seen , him
play within a brief space of : 'time.
Becket, the Vicar of Wakefield and
Wolsey. "All of ,;' these â¢ were ; Irving
unmistakably,"' she put it, "yet each
so different â not J from the outside,
but, if you like, . the mental , processes
were so different, so characteristic in
each of the cases, that you felt in the
presence; of | three wholly, different per
sons. I don't think it'is so necessary to
change' the; shell, the-, make-up," \u25a0 she
added, "so radically" as \ say/' the Ger
mans think. -'â¢ One; must' change Uhe
mental "make-up, f rouge and "wrinkle
the. brain, . so ', to speak. ,
"The greatest; "nien %have not always
been the most versatile," something
then evoked. / "Take \ Irving ( again
here. Or take Mounet-Sully.V in mod
ern stuff quite pitiably; ineffective. The
man needs the large planes, the large
lines oX the classic drama."- "He "abso
lutely cannot , think. in : ; little. V Fancy
Mounet-Sully, like some modern ac
tors," gaining a reputation -by looking
severely at his finger nails'." this
laughing. "But you would not mind
even being a modern actor with an
eye to your finger nails to be laughed
at so." . â¢ â¢
I asked her then where she got it,
the laugh, the voice^ warm as-Schu
mann-Heink's and flexible as Sem
brich's."
As a little girl, she told me to this,
she. sang in Colonel . Miles' juvenile
opera company for four years, though
"infantile experience is practically
useless." The seven years after
this were spent under the care
of' -Miss Ada Dow, who took
the friendless little Sarah Frost
âher real name- â to her heart and
home. Here is where Miss Marlowe
learned the love of Shakespeare,
which is her dearest faith: From' a
Welshman, pupil of Garcia's and
teacher of Edwin Booth, she .learned
the secret of- proper -use of the voice.
Above all this is the exercise she com
mends to the. dramatic' student. Very
proud her master is -of her, : she- told
me,' .with - charming archness; proud
that she can; go,* as she has this sea
son, through .thirty-two weeks with
out missing ja. night" or hurting a sin
gle fiber of her throat. Of one of her f
Ingomars she quaintly told- me, with
four notes only in "his voice, "quite
enough for. the . barbarian"â she de
cided, mimlckin" the four notes,
;*but when :he i came to ''play
Malvolio, , with its :i delicate shades,
its fantastic, variety, it'was' like a
piano ;.with half the -notes missing."
.â¢".This must the student study most
ardently," ..Miss Marlowe \u25a0 advised.
."Nay, S but .'tis a hard, life, the stage.
If \u25a0] a girl"; has'; the heart to . stick to
it for \ months . it almost means j that
there is something in her. High-class
gypsies we) are, with our private cars,

SCORED SUCCESSES IN THE SHAKESPEAREAN ROLES ANV> WHO LOOKS FORWARD TO A CONTINUED SEASON OF
THE GREAT DRAMATIST'S PLAYS WITH A KEEN DELIGHT. - -
tue' â Oh, we all know the Bianca
kind."
In effective staccato Mrs. Woodward
put it: "Cat!" '
Miss Marlowe added delightedly 'then
that next year she will be playing
Katherine to Sothern's Petruchio,
that she is to have three years of
Shakespearean drama, and that for
three years therefore she will have the
artistic happiness that she has long
hoped would be hers. For Shakespeare
is the Marlowe faith, her creed, her
gospel, her love, the Bible of her art,
and she has worked, fought, fasted and
prayed for it without ceasing. And the
thing she has waited for has come to
her, happily in her full and splendid
prime. Â«
That she has never seen Katharine
played the actress told me. "On the
whole I think it is best not lo before
one plays such parts. After all it is
the personal point of view that counts
so heavily here. The plays are known,
it Is the personal conception of the
characters that alone constitutes any
new value in the performances, and one
cannot help being more or less influ
enced by seeing another conception. Of
course, if there are holes in your im
personation there is plenty of time then
to find out what others have done. It
would be entirely foolish to Ignore .it
In such case. But first I -eel it i 3 best
to go as far as one can . oneself ."
Of the comparative difficulty of play
ing new. parts, and the Juliets and Por
tias In which you pit yourself against
the famous players of all she
spoke then. Imogen, of all Shake
speare's women, she best likes to play.
The difficult, delicate complexities of
the character particularly appeal to
her, though "all Shakespeare's women
are fascinatingly complex," she de
cided.*

"Juliet was very young," Miss Mar
lowe laughed. â¢'â¢â¢-.\u25a0

played, and best loves to play among

years since the play has been ade

the best cast the Shakespearean stage
now affords will be seen in the play

and is now In the full flower- of -her
achievement. Mr. Sothern's Romeo
will-be new to us.- It is only a season
old, but is said to.be a finished and.
highly sympathetic performance.
From Mr. Sothern'a previous artistic
history his Romeo should fail noth
ing of poetry, of romance, the chief
essentials, and the reading of the lines
will in any case be a sheer pleasure.'
Physically Mr. Sothern should again
satisfy, and altogether a delightful
performance ;. may ' confidently . *be
looked.for. The supporting compariy.
has shown, itself unusually adequate,
and the concerted work: â one instinc
tively, uses the musical term in the

rare smoothness, point and balance.

MUSICAL SEASON WILL .;
HAVE BRILLIANT END
Nothing could be more fitting* for the
close of a musical season, brilliant in
its every phase, than the Kneisel Quar
tet concerts of this week. The best of
opera, three seasons of it. we have had;
pianists, the best the world affords:
song recitals of the finest, Fritz Kreis
ler as the violin apostle and next ,week
Ysaye; even a good symphony concert
under Slgnof Polacco; . the. lovely.,

and now the best of chamber music.
We are Indeed favored. '..^ -Â» '-V
For many years the Kneisel Quartet

work is said to be of the '-miraculous 7
order, and no musician of any klira*-^

was in San Francisco before, while I
sat, ar.d, I fear me much, stared
at her. Nor do I repent, perdiei. It ?s
not every- day one gets the chance of
such delightful sinning. For Julia Mar
lowe is beautiful in the best sense of
the word, her face musical with mean
ing, instinct with every enchantment of.
line and tint. One began at that mad
dening dimple in the chin, of course â
Herrick would have sung it the grave
of many lovers. Sober I can only say it
fits most enticingly under the laughing
lips, full and red. Pearls, Herrick's al
chemy would have made of the little
white teeth, even as corn, that glint in
the lovely and frequent laughter. Com
edy sits on the tip of the nose, piquant
|y upturned, yet of a cut and size that
spell both beauty and brains. The eyes,
heavy-lidded, full, clear, brilliant,
gravely and firmly over-arched â these
I reached and became conscious of my
sin. j
1 was saying: "Yes, one was apt to |
exaggerate the age of actresses' â then j
suddenly stammered the thing I â¢ was
thinking: "What color are they, the
eyes?"
Laughter filled them as their owner,
quite simply, leaned tc the light and
said: "Gray-blue â like yours."
Mrs. Woodward commented that they
changed with the Marlowe mood. I
explained that mine had on occasion
been called green. Miss Marlowe said
that on occasion hers were greenâ then
cozily began: "What shall we talk
about?"
There were few things theatrical that
we had not talked of an hour later,
problem plays, Shakespeare, the
clothes drama, voice production, Ibsen,
whether or not it was "delightful to be
on the stage," and what not. I cannot
decide now, as I could not then,
whether the fine, alert wit, the lumi
nous intelligence, the uncommon and
delicious common sense with which
Miss Marlowe discusses things, or the
pure music of her voice, the play of her
mobile face, is the most charming. I
thought when she said "Come in," on
.a low, mellow, mellow G, that it did
not at all matter what she said so long
as she said it. I thought when she
arched that eloquent right eyebrow,
upturned a quizzical corner of that mo
bile mouth, that it did not at all matter
what she said so long as she looked so.
And then when she discussed the cast
.ing of a play, personal dynamics, any
thing in fact. I thought that it did not
at all matter how she looked, nor if she
had had a voice cracked as Verges so
long as she talked that way! Give Miss
Marlowe, too. while you are about it,
upward of five feet five of bonnie wo
manhood, "large, lovely arms, neck like I
a tower." and an extremely becoming i
black net gown, with rare old ivory lace
at throat and neck thereupon..
Naturally one fell to early talk of !
her Beatrice of the night before. Nat- I
urally I was glad to be permitted to j
say again how much I had enjoyed it. i
That her Beatrice had not been played }
as the shrew she is commonly made I J
repeated' particularly liked me,
"Shrewish she is," said the Beatrice,
"but so little shrewish, and so much
else besides. It Is such a frequent mis
take, Isn't it?â take Katharine as in
stanceâto play a character all in one
key. She is made simply a shrew,
when she is so much else. I remember
William Rolfe â "

"The same," Miss Marlowe, said;
Â«
Some women there are who remind
irresistibly of flowers, of their lift and
feway in the wind, their sudden beauty
among the green, their pregnant fra
grances. * There^are orchid women, as
Mrs. Campbell, " children of perilous
heights and rare suns, strange, subtly
moving, disquieting. Lily women -there
are, as Ethel Barrymore, slim, proud
and gleaming pale, as on sacrificial al
tars. Julia Marlowe â I could think
only of a garden of roses bursting into
bloom as Miss. Marlowe came into the
room to me the other day. Like nothing
more than a great rose she is, sweet
and radiant, flushed with health, sing
ing of the sun, of "my sister the rain,"
of dewy mornings.
A laugh like the trill of a thrush her
alded her coming. It was to Mr. Soth
ern's room at the St. Francis that she
came, as . I had previously come.
Guests owned Miss Marlowe's own
quarters and Mr. Sothern had been
good enough to offer his. I had had
time to note a rare edition of "The
Merchant of Venice" under the student
lamp, the pleasant green of carpet and
wall, when Miss Marlowe came in to
adorn it- Her friend, Mrs. Woodward,
the accompanying friend, quite signifi
cantly, of Miss Marlowe's .visit here
nine years ago, came with her.
Something the actress said, looking
round the room, of its being "an inva
sion," of Mr. Sothern's kindness, of its
seeming only like yesterday since she

The action of . Mrs. Clarence H.

date for School Director in the village
of Roslin, N. V., is occasioning a -lot of
gossip in the smart sets" -of the big
here as elsewhere. '_
While it \u25a0is true" that women have
sought public office ; before,: this \ is the
first ;time in an American city that a
leader in societyâ a .' woman of, wealth
and social supremacyâ has. offered ~ to
become a servant of â¢ the public.
It has ) long ; been known that # Mrg.
Mackay was' an intelligent ? student Â« of
economics and sociology, but few be
lieved she was so deeply inearnest as
to offer her â¢servicesâ whatever they
might amount toâ to the community in
which she lives. - â¢â¢
Now there is no doubt but this very
much-in-earnest society woman will do
good work, haying some strong notions
about .the responsibility of the school in
the development of â¢ character in . the

But the chief importance attaching to
! Mrs. ' Mackay's desire to serve â¢ the
Board of Education is the awakening it
may cause among women of leisure of
the duties they owe to the communities
in which * they make ; their' hoiriea. ' v

Since little schoolmaidens have
taken to basket-ball, rowing, wielding
the racquet and golf&tlcK, the "veran
da girl" has been losing her grip on
the- masculine heart' And the reason
is plain.
The athletic maid is such a good
fellow! She's abroad early and can
â¢walk or row or swim or do any old
thing that the men want to do. And
being such a good companion ehe holds
a sort of mortgage on the men's com
pany. Then the rest's easyâpropin
quity does it.
And all the while the veranda girl
in the fluffy white frock has been talk
ing to fat old ladies and incurables.
-And a wise girl doesn't draft her
summer campaign on a losing plan
more than onee â hence the passing of
the veranda girl for the girl who does
things.
To be sure, she garbs herself as
fetchingly as ever, but not in the flum
meries and fripperies of a decade ago.
These luminous things of beauty 'are
held for the evening blossoming â and
therein lies the cunning of ~ the plan.
It Is the contrast, the complexity, the
surprise, that wins.
And what wonderiâ for the garb of
the out-of-doors day reveals Â» the
strength, the agility, the breezy com
panionship, and the soft, . diaphanous'
things of evening reveal the woman in
her femininity and her tenderness.
Here is the summer- girl's trump card
â this sub rosa, for men don't read so
ciety "stuff.** And to the maid who
plays It well belongs the spoils..
Therefore, pretty maiden,- fashion
your summer frocks for day- wear as
fetching as you will, but make them
to walk In, without giving you grief
for their saf ety-^and the man with
yon the shivers. If there's one thing

ISSUES CIRCULAR OX
XEW CHILD LABOR LAW
ME3IBERS OF CALEDONIAN
CLUB AT STAG PARTY
"Resolved. That the Board of Edu
cation is determined in its efforts to
effect the establishment of separate
schools for Chinese and Japanese pu
pils, not only for the purpose of re
lieving Ihe congestion at present pre
vailing In our schools, but also for the
higher end that our children should not
be placed in any position where their
youthful impressions may be affected
by association with pupils, of the Mon
golian race.v-il
The resolution was adopted as the
result of a petition filed by. the Meth
odist; ministers of San Francisco, ask
ing the Board of Education not to ex
clude Japanese pupils from the schools,
and protesting against the establish
ment of separate schools for their edu
cation. The petitioners referred to the
voluntary withdrawal \u25a0of many Jap
anese pupils and ' suggested that a
separate school be established for back
ward pupils to which would be admit
ted children of any nationality.
School Directors Roncovieri, Walsh,
Altman and Boyle -expressed them
selves strongly in favor of the resolu
tion as adopted. They expressed the
opinion that the association of white
and Mongolian pupils is demoralizing
to the former, and that in future the
indiscriminate practice would not be
permitted. . As soon as the condition of
the school funds will permit, the board
will set aside some school for Japanese
pupils, Just as there is now one for the
accommodation of Chinese pupils.
"Whereas, It is the sense of the mem
bers of the Board of Education that the
admission of children of .Japanese or
Mongolian descent ; as pupils of our,
common schools is contrary -l to the
spirit and the fetter of the law, and
that the Indiscriminate association of
such pupils with Caucasian children. is
baneful and demoralizing in- the ex
treme, the ideas entertained and prac
ticed by people of Monogolian v or Jap
anese affiliations being widely diver
gent from those of Americans; and
"Whereas, The school situation has
become serious through the great num
bers of Japanese in our midst, many
instances 'of American children being
excluded from schools by Japanese
pupils, through the right of priority of
admission incidental, to lack of ade
quate accommodation - and room,
through no fault or neglect of this de
partment, attributable to the insuffi
ciency of funds'; therefore be It
"Whereas, Section 1662 of the State
Political Code of California, the con
stitutionality of .this section - having
been upheld and sustained by our Su
preme Court, vests City Boards of Edu
cation with the power to establish
separate schools for. the accommoda
tion of children of Indian, Mongolian or
Chinese descent, and further provides
that when such . separate - schools are
established, \ that Indian," Chinese or
Mongolian children must not be: ad
mitted to other, schools of our public
school. system; and â¢
:,' "Whereas, The attention of the Board
of Education of. this r city and county
in its' visits of inspection to the:differ
ent schools has been repeatedly, di
rected toward' the attendance ? of chil
dren of Japanese descent. as pupils, and
the- evil consequences liable to result
therefrom through the indiscriminate
aiVciation of children of different
races; and
The Board of Education held a spe
cial meeting yesterday, and took a de
termined stand against the -admission
of Chinese and Japanese pupils to
schools where white children are being
educated. The : " board - unanimously
adopted resolutions declaring itself op
posed to the promiscuous association
of white and Mongolian pupils, and de
claring its policy to favor in future the
establishment of " separate schools* f or

A RGENTIXA is making such rapid development that the pbs- !
ZX sibilities of our trade relations with the big and prosperous*
\u25a0* *â¢ South American state are worth watching for chances of
which to take advantage. Its importance is shown by the statement :
that the foreign commerce of the Argentine" Republic has nearly ,
quadrupled in the last twelve years, and last year her exports
exceeded her imports by nearly $77,000,0*0. Of this trade England
gets three times as much as the tUnited States. The total foreign
commerce of the Argentine is slightly over the $450,000,000 mark,
and that amount places her close to Canada in commercial impor
tance, for the Dominion's total for 1904 was $464,978494. ;
How little we get of this rapidly increasing business of the South
American republic is most strikingly illustrated by the figures on '
textiles, which are the principal import. ' Out of the $57,000,000 they
buy we sell them only a little over $250,000. They purchase enor- i
mous quantities of glass and crockery ware, footing up $16,000,000.
If we had the manufacturing skill and: enterprise to transform our
immense sand dunes into glassware and shipped the product south
we would soon have wealth enough therefrom to cover the peninsula
with palaces from Laurel Hill to the Pacific.
Probably the^chief bar to our getting a bigger slice of this great
trade. . which is-so enriching England, is' that we take;so little of the .
goods they have to sell. They produce chiefly hides'- and wool,. and '.'
so a stimulus to our manufacturing of ; shoes and of; woolen cloths
to such development that 1 we could sell them abundantly and cheaply â¢
in that big and rich agricultural area would perhaps open wide the
door to a new .. opportunity nearly as considerable as our -neighbor,
Canada, of whose trade we get '6o per cent. The portion of the At- .!
gentine trade we are now getting is only 13 per "cent, and that coun- !
try is developing nearly doubly as fast as ;is Canada; China" is not
the only new field of. invitation to commercial ; energy- which \ is now '\u25a0!
presented to America. ;.l ..'..'_ .1 -^ â¢ j

Mrs. S. T. Rorer, the well-known
culinary expert, gave a dinner recently
to a cooking class of young .married
women, says the New York Globe. \u25a0
Mrs. Rorer enlivened this excellent
dinner with a number of stories about
cooking.
"I am making," she said, "a collec
tion of cooking stories, and some day
perhaps I will publish them all in a
book. I am continually adding to my
stock. Only yesterday a new cooking
story was told me by a dispirited
young wife. j,-M
"This young, wife, who had never
cooked so much as a beefsteak in her
life, all of a sudden bought a cook
book, entered her kitchen and plunged
into the construction of an elaborate
and difficult veal pie.
"The pie, a strange looking object,
' was served to her husband, a caustic
person, that night for dinner. He
helped himself, tried a mouthful, and
*' 'A meat pie,*, said the wife. 'I
â¢ made it out of Harry Harker's cook
-book." . v ~Â£ * - "*"* c, â¢\u25a0 ..' '
I " *Ah,* said the man, 'this leathery
part is the binding, I suppose. '." .
. . . .
It is given out from Washington that Japan has in good faith '
observed the understanding that she had with the United States at
the beginning of the war. There is no doubt that Secretary Hay's
identical note to the powers, which pledged them to respect the :
territory and the administrative entity of China, .was inspired by
that understanding. But if a permanent , policy bind one it must I
bind all. If Japan is not to occupy the Chinese territory she has.
recovered from Russia, it must not under any pretext be occupied
by any other nation. The Asiatics are getting some current illus-j
trations of European craft. Germany forced China into a treaty ,
covering certain mining concessions on Chinese territory, and re- j.
.serving the rights of Chinese miners to continue the operation of j
their mining property in the same territory. Now Germany declares j
that this means that the Chinese miners must continue to mine by !
their former primitive processes, and it will be a cause of war if ;
they adopt modern machinery and methods. f '<
" That is insufferable. It is such a mixture of brutality and in
solence as to rouse any decent man's indignation. Yet it conies from j
one of the Christian nations which pretend such interest in the ad- ]
vancement of China. The lesson will not be lost on Japan. When j
a treaty of peace is made, on the lines of Mr. Hay's identical note, it j
will not shut Japan out of China for the purpose of letting other
nations in. It" will set up a Monroe doctrine for Eastern Asia, by j
making Chinese territory and sovereignty inviolable. If the United
States propose such a treaty, of necessity this country and Japan J
become committed to its faithful execution. Already Germany by j
her outrageous interpretation of her mining treaty is getting ready j
to make war on China because Chinese miners want to buy im- .
proved mining machinery in the United States, and this will be J
made a pretext for seizing more territory. The treaty of peace,
must put a stop to this sort of thing, and if it do not, the peace of
the world requires that Japan be permitted a free hand in making;
terms with Russia. j
The other part of the outgiving from Washington is inexplic- ,
able. There was nothing in Mr. Hay's note nor in the pledge of the !
powers respecting Korea. That kingdom was openly coveted by â¢
Russia. It is incapable of self-defense. Its possession by Russia is
a constant menace to Japan. Already the alienation of its territory^
had begun by the same processes employed by Russia in getting n â¢
foothold in Manchuria. For this purpose leases were used, troops '
followed up the leasehold, and the absorption of Korea by Russia;
was far advanced when Japan interfered and practically took charge .
of the Korean Government.
At this moment it is impossible to see any relation between
a treaty of peace with Russia and Japan's attitude in Korea. If the j
United States is interested at all in Korea, it is in the preservation!
* of that kingdom from falling into the hands of Russia or any other
Western power. If Japan is compelled to change her present rela
tions to Korea, the United States cannot, without disgrace, be a
party to any plan that will permit that kingdom to be victimized as
China was. In fact this country must see to it that every feature of
the treaty be protective of all Eastern Asiatic territory against Eu
ropean aggression. \Jnless that is done, we will hold the unenviable
position of pulling other people's chestnuts out of the fire. If we'
hold a position of commanding- influence that is respected by the "
world, we should use it in promoting justice in dealing with Asia. !
Justice has been considered a negligible quantity heretofore in deal
ing with that part of the world. Â»If we ignore it also, we share in '
the dishonor. If we enforce it we deserve honor. ( i
THERE is a semi-official statement of the position of our Gov
ernment as to the terms of peace between Japan and Russia.
These terms include the restoration of all. Manchuria to China,
and tlfe restoration of the status quo ante bellum of Korea. _ bucli
conditions necessarily imply a money indemnity, for Japan. In her
brief war with China Japan took Port Arthur and the Liaoyang
Peninsula and controlled Shantung and the Gulf, of Pechih. Eu
ropean nations interfered, compelling the abrogation -of -the treaty
of peace between the two Asiatic countries- and forced Japan to
surrender her mainland conquests and accept Formosa as the reward
of her victory. All this was done under the pretense of desiring,
to preserve the territorial- integrity of China. Almost immediately
after this denial to Japan of her rights won by conquest, Germany
seized valuable territory belonging to China on the Gulf of Pechih
and Russia took Port Arthur and the Liaoyang Peninsula. f -
Xo nations were ever subjected to such outrageous injustice as
the Western peace-making and piece-taking nations', forced upon
Japan and China. Japan never misunderstood its meaning. ? She
"knew that it meant' Russian absorption of Korea and that Japan
must become a Russian vassal. â¢ Foreseeing the struggle for her ex
istence, Tapan prepared for it with rare foresight- and -patience.
Snubbed'and laughed at by Russia, she bided, her 'time.'. General
Kuropatkin said once while visiting Tokio, as he looked out upon
crowds of the small sized Japanese, "We will have to' give these
monkeys a whipping." He has tried it and has been chased from
Newchwang to Harbin, whipped in every battle.
The interference of the Western nations in the Japanese-
Chinese treaty caused the present war. The participants in that
interference were moved to it by Russia. They made China believe
that they regarded her territory as too sacred to be taken by Japan,,
and then proceeded to take it themselves. Now Japan has made
a second conquest. She has captured from one robber all that he
stole from China, and has set the other robbers thinking about
their nefarious title, and it may be assumed that she will not permit
such interference and dictation as she was compelled to submit to
before.

WHEN housework becomes monot
onous to a woman is *be fault In
the occupation or in the woman?
The number of women co-day who find
housework unattractive and Irksome is
increasing at an alarming rate, as the
growing popularity of hotel and board
ing-house life will attest.
What Is the real secret of the dislike
manifested by the home-keeping sex
for a profession which holds such in
numerable opportunities for the exer
cise of one's best talents?
Women nowadays seem to be de
veloping a sort of hysterical repug
nance to such responsibilities. The
young wife may throw herself with en
thusiasm into housekeeping for a time,
but only for a time. Her interest soon
wanes, and the fever for change of
occupation or for diversion takes Its
place.
"Anything to ret away from house
work" is the slogan of the modern
fighter for the broader life. And yet
the profession of home-making is brim
ful of charm and beauty to those who
know how to discover its possibilities.
When domestic duties become dis
tasteful to a woman the cause fre
quently, lies In her lack of Interest in
the details of her work. Few women
\ enjoy the details of work as men do.
It Is the sum of her work that appeals
to the average woman, and when the
inevitable details are encountered her
seal abates or vanishes altogether." \ .
Whatever a woman can be emotion
ally Interested in she can accomplish
well. Details are always more or less
tedious to her, and the only way she
manages them, as a rule, is by keeping
her mind occupied with something else.
When a. woman really . delights in
making a pudding, or darning, socks,
cr sweeping the floor, it is because she
can forget the details in the glowing
thought of how pleased somebody will
be to eat that pudding, or wear those
socks, or enjoy, that clean, white floor.
And that "somebody" is either, a hus
band or a child, or some one who looks
to her for comfort and happiness. It
is the consciousness of giving comfort
and happiness that makes her work
agreeable.
Housework to-day has not the senti
mental appeal It once had for the gen
tler sex. The old-fashioned woman de
lighted In the performance of such la
bor, not only because it was neces
sary, but because housework at that
time was considered unquestionably
the most admirable occupation for wo
men.
In those days there were no rival in
terests to divert women from the tradi
tional , domestic paths. To-day there
are any number of such interests.
Homekeeplng. accordingly, has lost Its
charm in the eyes of many women.
Just as soon as the emotional sex
learns to love housework- for Its own
sake â Just as soon as women gain an
intellectual appreciation of what â¢ a
home' really meansâ this charm will be*
rediscovered.
In the business world many women
are gaining that faculty which by na
ture they lackâ the ability to master
details. The woman who has acquired
I this faculty and can see the beauty in
housekeeping Is the woman who is
bound \u25a0 to make a complete success of
such work.
If every woman who finds house
keeping irksome would train herself to
become Interested In the details of her.
occupation she would soon see that the
tedium Is not \n her duties, but in her
failure to meet them rightly. .
Learn to work for the sheer, Joy of
working. See how much Interest you
can Infuse into such homely \u25a0 duties as
washing, dishes and sweeping j floor-.
Don't ignore the details, but lore them.
Seek constantly new . ways of dcrlns
your work. Try to Improve daily.
Work is beautiful if you make it so.

BEAUTIFYING CITIES;
, Members of the Board of Assessors
have come into possession of a strange
relic from the Orient â a Chinese ioke.
The relic, says the Chicago News. Is a
large plaque of dark wood, in which
are imbedded three carved ivory
monkeys. The plaque was received
from San Francisco by Assessor Wil
liam H. Weber, secretary of the board.
When he unpacked it he was unable
to understand the meaning of the odd
position. of the three monkeys. One had
his paws over his eyes, another over
his ears and the third had covered his
mouth. B&V3
"We'll have to call in a Chinaman to
interpret * that" joke," said -Assessor C.
E. Randall. "There's some subtle
.Oriental meaning to these monkeys."
Accordingly a Chinaman from Clark
street was escorted to the Assessor's
office. "Now I tell us what' this means!"
said Assessor Weber.
The Chinaman looked at the monkeys
for a moment. - Then a grin overspread
his face, and he explained the figures
were symbolical of deafness/ dumbness
and blindness.
;\u25a0'' Vely plain," he said. "Monkey allee

TO BUSINESS MEN.
A young girl was talking about mos
quitoes. She had spent the summer
in a place where they were numerous.
."But I noticed," - she said, "that
when I wore a yellow dress I didn't get
a single bite."
V'Did you notice that?" said the
young scientist. And then he went on
eagerly: ; . \
- "I am glad you noticed that, for it
is a verification of certain experiments
that ;we have made.
i ,'; VWe made these experiments in a
gauze - tent, and their object was to
ascertain the effect on mosquitoes of
colors. . \u25a0 %
"We placed in the : tent , boxes lined

"Songs from a Georgia Garden" is
a little book of short poems by Robert
Loveman. We quote here a sample of
his fart. It is his expression of a
thought BUggestedto him by one of
the most wonderful of the .'world's
greatest paintings.
i A half somber. and \ half amusing.co
incidence in-, this ' tragedy .of love'"' is
that when the" King ; wooed Jane \u25a0 Sey
mour she answered \u25a0\u25a0 him in the " self
'siime' words which;; Anne" Boleyn had
used when the ' made love ; to
herâ "l am grieved | to hear it, rny\ liege,

your Queen." "Anne overhears this, arid
there is a scenÂ«> â¢ The King ! refuses : to
"di'miss " Jane Seymour,! saying 'that \ the
lovemaking was his fault and not hers.
One of the best bits in the book, is
where ; the two ; women - find each other
out, and " Jane Seymour counters
against . the -, : : Queen's f accusation . ; by
Ehowing that she knows that \Anne .was
encouraging* the passion of Sir Henry

Turning from this picture it is inter
esting to get the image the author has
discovered for us , of the , woman who
was Ann Boleyn's rival \u25a0 and beat the
reigning beauty at her own game of
supercesslon. '. This' Jane Seymour was
"tall,, exquisitely" proportioned, with a
complexion - of the .utmost brilliancy'
and delicacy; ' large, liquid blue 'eyes
and "chestnut tresses." She had such
charms as madeit seem marvelous
that* Anne Boleyn should have kept her
in her service, -where her.; charms .were
sure to captivate the ; monarch^ It ;is
supposed' Anne ; Boleyn was overconfi
dent of her 'own attractions until V too
late, and i then she became too ; fright
ened of Henry's temper to dismiss Jane
Seymour.: \u25a0/
The glamour of the supernatural Is.
thrown around the story by the rela
tion of the doings of the demon, Herne,
the Hunter. This apparition has a part
to play in nearly all the principal
events and the descriptions of him and
his doings are quite ghostly and well
written. The purpose .of the tale is
chiefly to relate the coquetry of Anne
Boleyn and of how severely she suf
fered for it. She is described as a
woman of such rare beauty and . ac
complishments. t that she could easily
have permanently ruled over Henry
had she not desired to" hold other hearts
besides his. We are told that she had
irregular but charming ; features, ' a
chip beautifully, rounded, brows smooth
and white as snow, and the rose could
not vie with the beauty of lier cheek.
Her neck, of course, : interests usâ that
neck on which the headsman's ax was
to fall ; It* was long and slender. - Her
eyes were large and blue - and of irre
sistible witchery.

BOOK OF SHORT POEMS
BY ROBERT LOVEMAN
ROMANCE OF HENRY VIII
AND HIS MANY LOVES
The widely appreciated negro poet,
Paul Laurence Dunbar, has made a
new little book of ' his pretty verses.
They have been published separately
before by the. Century Company and
others, but when thus brought together
they i make quite a nice little bouquet
of ""Lyrics of Sunshine and Shadow,"
as he entitles them; and , they prove
that the power of giving literary ex
pression to poetic fancy is one of the
g4fts of the emancipated race. One of
his best is called "The Place Where the
Rainbow Ends," in ! which he expresses
the . sentiment ) that with contentment,
though the pot may hold pottage, arid
the ' place be ; a cottage, there may \u25a0be
the place where the rainbow ends,' and
there the fabulous treasure lie. Per
haps the best â¢ one is that called "The
Barrier.",
The Midnight wooed the Morning Star. .
And prayed ' hÂ«r: ' "Love, come nearer;

NEW VERSES
BY THE NEGRO POET
The first break in that peace of pas
siveness with which Rosamond tried to
medicine her soul comes when a com
bination of circumstances, including
her new husband's commands, compels
her to open the box holding the remem
brances of her love-life with, the young
officer who was her first husband: -"It
was a'small thing enough; a'common,
battered tin box, to ranlc with such Im
portance. But it held tragedyâ more
than tragedy â a woman's murdered
youth. Weir did â¢ Jani remember the
day it had come back to the little home
up in the hillsâ all that was left to
them of their handsome young lord.
They could not carry Rosamond back
to her dead. What soldier's widow can
hope for that last tragic comfort?"

Then he thus excused his prevarica

upon truthful topics in a brilliant and
society-like way. Besides I had to give
them back the small change. I never
in my life heard such stilted, , patron
izing talk as they were giving you."
(Lothrop Publishing Company, Bos
ton; fl 50.)
The volume is illustrated by Charles
Copeland. One scene he has chosen to
give us a sight of is that wherein the
heroine is visited by some fastidious la
dies from the former fashionable neigh
borhood of Miss Billy's better circum
stanced existence. These ladies are of
those who hear no sound of super silly
"in the adverb supercilious." They first
burst upon Miss Billy with the an
nouncement that it is such an odd co
incidence that Miss Billy's new house
is the one that had formerly been oc
cupied by the coachman of these cor
dial callers. Miss Billy Is trying to
brace herself to be imperturbably po
lite under the fire of these thought
fully kind allusions to her altered cir
cumstances, when enters to her rescue
her little brother Thornton, an imp of
precocity, polite prevarication, and
physical perfections enough to make
ladies stare in astonished admiration
upon the boy's audacious front. By
him the situation is saved, for he
speaks airily of fixing up the new
home expensively â conservatories,
stables and things. After the ordeal Is
over the clever youth says to Miss
Billy: "Well?" Reproachfully Miss
Billy said betwixt a laugh and^ cry,
"It's far from well, Theodore Lee.
You told awful, unmitigated false
hoods!"
"Miss Billyh is a story written by
two women journalists of Dubuque, la.,
and it tells of how Miss Billy and her
family had to move, for financial rea
sons, into a most unpromising street,
and of the way she went about cheer
fully and cleverly to better her neigh
borhood. The sayings and doings of
the queer people round her make a
tale to tell, and the upper purpose of
the book is to show what tact arid
bright-mindedness can do in obviating
the disagreeables of environment un
der the obstacles of which most peo
ple would sulk. Miss Billy was:
A grlrl who has co many .willful ways
She would have caused Job's patienoe to

A little better she would surely make him.

explained why- the socialist is not

as aj*e so many other workers and

He exults in the trust, for it l? largely

All except one of these chapters, name
ly, the "Cupidity of Carroll," have
been published serially, in Collier's
Weekly and the Saturday Evening
Post. As now collected they make
something like a connected story, for
the same characters are studied
throughout the eight chapters, though
each makes a complete narration in
â¢itself.
The book is illustrated by J. Ham
bidge and he seizes on an amusing epi
sode in the very clever chapter V,
called "A Strategical Defeat," to pic
ture a part of a little game of prac
tical politics in which a bright, good
and ambitious woman outmaneuvers
three or more experienced men who
were adepts \u25a0in manipulating political
events. The woman is one of the trus
tees of the university. She has phil
anthropic hobbies and one of them is
;"A '.Woman's Home,'.' where foundlings
are often left. The overflow of babies
are sent to the care of the county
board. She wishes the affairs of the
university's treasurer investigated.
The men are trying strategically, to
defeat her demand ; for this investiga
tion. The county board is induced to
refuse to take any more foundlings
from her institution. This is to force
her- to compromise*, on the other mea
sure. She gets the president of the
board interested in her talk about \u25a0 a
foundling, puts it in his arms, then
places her hands behind her back and
leaves him with the responsibility. She
wins in that move and ultimately . de
feats all the men who sought strategic
ally to hold back the treasury investi
gation. It's a good story and shows
that in some ways woman may be very
useful in purifying politics.

SOCIALISM has a clever advo
cate in Jack London. He show
ed himself one consummately
so in that paper called "The
Scab." which was published
some time ago in one of the
magazines, and which is now embodied
Jn- his new socialistic book, "The War
of- the Classes." "The Scab" is one of
the seven essays which make the book,
and it is the best, but it does not dis
tance the other six. .for it sets a pace
which they, striving to follow close in
cleverness, all get placed near to. If
Jack London ever writes any work of
elaborate length favoring industrial
collectivism as strong in argument,
clear in exposition and brilliant in the
â¢wit of its presentation as is the paper
called 'â¢The Scab," then may the social
ists well crown him as one of their
most forceful and attention-compelling
writers. Properly speaking, there are
but Â£ix essays; the last paper is a bit
of succinct autobiography. It is called
"How I Became a Socialist." It may be
best to make this last first and begin by
telling how began In London's brain the
evolution toward the writing of these
socialistic papers.
\u25a0He tells us in this sketch of his life
that in his youth he belonged to the
school called "individualism." . and that
he sang the paean of the strong with
all his heart. That was because he
\u25a0was strong himself â strong with the
strength of good health and hard mus
cles. Later his adventures led him to a
condition in life where he saw men who
had been stronger in the start for the
social struggle than he. and yet they
ended in "the shambles at the bottom
of the social pit." He listened to these
"unfortunates. The woman of the
-streets and the man of the gutter drew
very close to him, and he says: "As I
listened my brain began to work." Then
there came to him thisâ a sort of wak
ing nightmare: "I saw the picture of
the social pit as vividly as if it were a
concrete thing, and at the bottom of
the pit I saw them, myself above them,
not far. and hanging on to the slippery
wall by main strength and sweat. And
I confess a terror seized me. What
ivhen my strength failed?" This vision,
with some added experiences, such as
being sentenced to thirty days in the
penitentiary for having no fixed abode
nor visible means of support, finished
the job of what he calls hammering the
rampant individualism out of him.
In the preface the importance .of so
cialism is shown and some of the fig
ures given of its vote in this country â
400 per cent gain in the last four
years, and now 435.000. The author
explains that socialism is revolution
ary in its purpose and in its scope
greater than any revolution that has
ever occurred in the history of the
world.
"It presents a new spectacle to the
astonished world â that of an organ
ized. International revolutionary move
ment" Nearing the end of his pref
ace. London lets out from the fighter
in him this fling at those who differ
from his socialistic creed because of
their complacent, superficial knowl
edge of it: ."The average, member of
the capitalist class, when he discusses
socialism, is condemned out of his own
mouth. He does not know the litera
ture of socialism, its philosophy, nor
its politics. He wags his head sagely
and rattles the dry bones of dead and
buried ideas."
The first essay is called 'The Class
Struggle," and in it is maintained the
uselessness of trying to deny that
there is such a thing as a class strug
gle in America. The struggle is be
gun, and the question now is what will
be the outcome of the class struggle.
In this paper the policy and the prog
ress of socialism to capture the trades
union is explained. The adoption of
.socialistic principles by the Western
Federation of Miners is cited as an
example. The second paper, called
"The Tramp," is a fine sociological
study. The view is taken that the
tramp is a representative of the vast
army of the unemployed and that
. these are mainly made so by social
conditions. It is shown that this shift
ing army of the unemployed Is neces
sary to the present social system and
maintains that system's integrity more
.potently than the courts, police or
military.
In the third paper, called "The
Scab." it is shown that we are all
scabs. The epithet is admitted to be
opprobrious, but it is shown that it
fits us all except a very few, such as
Rockefeller, and even he scabs on oc
casion. Not only individually do we
scab, but collectively, as America, we
scab against England. A scab is de
fined to be one who gives more value
for the same price than another. Now
this is very cleverly shown by Lon
don to be a wrong thing to do, for by
it, although we do not always starve
out our neighbor, we certainly injure
him and diminish his happiness and
his living. To avoid thfe error It is
necessary to be a non-scab. Now to
be a non-scab consistently it is proper
to strive always to give least for most.
TBis - is ' universally branded as being
stingy, selfish and unchristlan-like.
This leaves us in a dilemma. It's be
ing between the devil and the deep
cea. Turn either way and we must
needs do a mean thing. r
You may try to dodge by saying it
is just London's cleverness which
places us all in this dilemma, but he
maintains that.it is the present social
system which forces these disagree
able alternatives upon us. That is the
evil of -Individualism. Whilst he has
us placed in that dilemma is London's
opportunity to argue socialism to us.
"Since to. give least for most, and' to
give most for least, are universally
bad. what remains? Equity remains,
â¢which is to give like for like, neither
more" nor less. But this equity, so
ciety, as at present constituted, can
not give."
Whatever ' may be the personal con
victionts of the reader of the book as to
socialism, he cannot escape London's
argument that all of us who are en
gaged !n the individualistic; struggle'
for existence are truly scabbing, nor
can he fail to admire the brilliance of
the wits which went Into the designing
and the execution of that paper.

"The statistical position here is healthy, for.
notwlthsandlng the fact of Imports being
larger than ever before (to May 1). deliveries
have more than kept pace, and stocks in deal-.

LONDON, May 6.â Whien Mrs. Ogden
Goelet arrived : in ; London from the
United States last week she was much
disappointed to find that her daughter,
the Duchessof Roxburghe, had not se
cured a town: house,' if not; as a per
manent residence, at; least forthe Lon^
don season. It seems that Mrs. Goelet
had cabled frprn America that a< house
was to be secured at any cost," arid an
ticipating no difficulty, she invited a
considerable .; number of :-.,;. American
friends to be her guests during 'a part
of the season. Her disappointment was
intense when she arrived arid Vf ound
that she had to put up at' one' of the
hotels. , ' y .
She immediately telephoned to all the
leading firms, of house" agents, asking
what they had on their books," arid 'hav-'
ing satisfied herself that there was no
eligible residence to, be obtained, she
told her friends that- she .would 1 leave
London and spend the. season- in- Paris
It was only through \u25a0 the intervention
of the Dowager Duchess of Roxburghe
thaj^ she was prevailed upon to.aban
don the "idea of starting off at f once.
Arrangements" were quickly made by
which Mrs. Goelet and her party are to
be entertained later on at the Duke's
place in Scotland and matters were
thus smoothed over for the tiriie being.
The fastidious â¢ notions of: the young
.Duchess are, a the house agents declare,
the obstacles in the way of providing a
suitable residence for her." As "far back
as la-st October she had a list of 'some
of the finest houses in â¢.Loridori; submit
ted to hen but she ? rejected them all.
Mrs. Goelet says now that the Duchess
must have a residence, new or- old, in
London by next seasqn. , \u25a0;

Union Pacific and St. Paul continued
their leadership of the market on the
reaction as well as on the recovery-
There- was some temporary show of
strength in: other quarters, but it was
not sustained. Unofficial reports, which
were denied, that Lake Shore had ac
quired some, blocks' of. Erie gave a firm
tone to those stocks. .Yesterday's jump
in People's Gas was found this morn
ing to have been due to a false report
as to the proposed gas legislation: and
that stock dropped back. The advance
in Northern Pacific was detrimental to
the market, rather than helpful. ;
The success achieved in stopping.the
decline drove a large short interest to
cover and there was a substantial
rally. The hope was entertained that
the worst of the liquidation was 'over
and that the market was to settle down
into dulltrading and sluggish, move
ment. But liquidation was renewed In
force and it became manifest *that large
amounts withheld - fronv the market
during the period of demoralization re
mained to be liquidated. The process
forced prices lower: than during the
preceding week and- disturbed holdings
on margins which had been unimpaired
by the previous declines. !
'NEW YORK. May 6.â To-day's dull
and sagging stock market was In ac
cordance with general expectation and
was corroborative of the view that yes-,
terday's buying largely represented
"profit-taking by' shorts; With this de
parture and the : short interests satis
fled, prices slipped back x to-day,. more
from the exhaustion of the demand
than from any result of active pressure,
to sell. s The supposition is general that
a period of quiet speculation is before
thie_market in the absence of important
new, developments, with the possibility
of some further* speculative liquidation
yet lo be concluded. So many illusions
have been dissipated and "corresponding
losses and disappointments suffered by,
those who accepted unwarranted ru-,
mors in good faith, that an early re
newal of speculative confidence is not'
counted upon. What adds to -this
probability is the approach of the. sea
son of uncertainty and vicissitudes for
the country's crops arid the normal^un
settling effect of this period upon busi
ness, in general. .

Alter Doctors and Hospitals Pronounced Case Incur-
ableâ Prayed for Deathâ Body a Mass.of Dis-
ease, Skin Cracked, Nails Fell Off; Hair Dead
and Lifelessâ Blessed Relief from First Appli-
cation of Cuticuraâ Cured in Six Weeks.
I have been afflicted for twenty years with an obstinate skin disease,
called by some M. D.'s Psoriasis, and others Leprosy, commencing on my
scalp: an>! in spite of a'] 1 cnuld do. witli ihe help of the most skillful 'doc-
tor*, it slowly but surely extended' until a year ago this winter it covered
my entire person in the form of dry scales. For the last three years I have
been ;:::ablc to do any iabor. and suffering intensely .all the time. Every
â¢ morning there would be nearly a dustpanful of scales taken from the sheet
on m> bed. some oi them half as large as the envelope containing this let-
ter. In the iaiter part of winter mv skin commenced cracking open. I
tried eveo-thing, almost^ that could.be thought of, without any relief. The
12th of June I started West, in hopes I could reach the Hot Springs. I
reached Detroit and was so low -I thought I should have to go to the
hospital, but finally got as tar as Lansing, Mich., where I had a ?ister liv-
ing. One Dr. treated me about two weeks, but did me no good. All
thought I had but a short time to live. I earnestly prayed to die. Cracked
through the skin all over my back, across my ribs, arms, hands, limbs; feet
badly swollen; toenails came off; fingernails dead and hard as. a bone: hair
dead, dry and lifeless as old straw. Omy God! how I did suffer.
My sister. Mrs. E. H. Davis, had a small part of a Box .of Cuticura in
the .house. She wouldn't give up;- said, "We will try Cuticura." Somewas
appn'ed'on one hand and arm. Eureka! there was relief: stopped the terrible
burning sensation from the word go. They immediately got Cuticura^ Re-
solvent, Ointment and Soap.' I commenced by taking one tablespoonful of
Cuticura Resolvent three times a day after meals; had a bath once a day.
water about blood heat: used Cuticura Soap freely; applied Cuticura Oint-
ment morning and. evening. Result: Returned to my home "in just six
weeks from the time I left, and my skin as smooth as this sheet of paper.

The above testimonial was given us in 1880. twenty-five years ago. and
is published at this- time to show that the cure was permanent, as Mr. Car-
penter himself states in the following letter, written March 20, 1905: "I
have never suffered with the disease since. The Cuticura remedies should
come to the knowledge of every one troubled with skin diseases.- They have
genuine merit. If my own case had been the only one it would be "different,
but several cases have come to my knowledge "just; as wonderful as my
own. I am now in my seventy-fourth year and in pretty good health
(Signed) HIRAM E. CARPENTER, Henderson, N. V., March 20^1005."
The above is only cne of many marvelous, cures made. by the Cuticura
remedies. In this case the cure not only meant escape from terrible suffer-
ing and freedom from disfiguration, but undoubtedly prolonged his
life, as it is not probable that he could, have lived in the condition he was
before cured by Cuticura, after trying all known remedies without any benefit,
and after having been pronounced incurable by Doctors and Hospitals.

LONDON, May 6.â Premier Balfour,

predicted that the country would never

1 â¢ LONDON, May 6.â The banquet In
fcon^r cf Retiring Embassador Joseph
H. Choate in the Mansion House last
.night was spread in the Egyptian Hall,
which was draped with the banners of
past LÂ«ord Mayors and the flags of
polonies. Arranged behind the Lord
Mayor and Mr. Choate was the cor
poration plate centerpiece crossed by a
huge sword and mace, while the small
er pieces of this wonderful silver serv
ice. Including the enormous loving cup,
tvere used on the tables. The rich red
uniforms of the army officers, together
with those of members from the mu
nicipal government and a vast number
of red-coated, powdered household at
tendants, made a gala scene.
The Archbishop of Canterbury pro-
Bounced grace and the benediction.
The aged Lord Mayor, a white-bearded,
picturesque figure In his rich costume, !
rose and toasted the King and Queen.
Â£.t Henr;- Carnpbell-Bannerman pro
posed "the President," eulogizing him
cc a "genuine typical character of
America, an official friend of peace,
though perhaps not of a quiescent dis
position."
Premier^ Balfour,^ In toasting Mr.
Chdatel'said:
\u25a0'No greater honor could have been :
done me than to have proposed this
toast."
He congratulated the Lord Mayor on
being the host of Great Britain on this
memorable occasion. Mr. Choate, he
said, had been with Britons in days
of mourning and rejoicing, of disaster
and of victory, not only as the rep
resentative of a great state, but ever
ready to take his part In any phase of
British public life n<ft connected with
politics, and had ever played his part
\u25a0with distinction. He hoped Mr. Choate
â¢would carry away with him much more
than merely diplomatic ideas.
Mr. Balfour dilated on the close re
lations between the two countries and
the common sentiment of amity which
eurvived always despite the mistakes of
official leaders. He said that with the
lapse of decades the old bitterness had
been lost in the historic past; that all
causes of difficulty had vanished and
that there had emerged slowly but
eurely a feeling of common brother
hood, the surest prospect, he ventured
to think, of international peace and
progress. In conclusion . Mr. Balfour
said that their farewell to Mr. Choate
\u25a0was not formal and official, but came
from their hearts. On rising Mr.
Choate was greeted with rounds of
applause.
He Epoke at considerable length and
\u25a0with much feeling. He eaid that he was
homesick and glad to be returning to
his native land, where old friends were
diminishing . as fast as new ones were
making here. If he remained much
longer, he said, he would have a worse
disease than homesickness, namely,'
anglomanla. An American President
had once wisely said that he would not
trust an Embassador in England more
than four years, because the English
would spoil him. They would not spoil
him as the children of Israel spoiled
the Midianltes, but, contrarywise, by
heaping compliments and benefits upon
them. He said he did not dare 'trust
himself to speak of the honor he felt
in being the guest of such an assembly
gathered to say farewelL "Altogether
too* much credit has been attributed to
me," Mr. Choate said, "for the happy
end delightful relations now existing
between the united countries. If I have
contributed to maintain what I ; have
found on taking up. my; post the last
clx years will be the proudest of my
life. The real reason for the " happy
Ctate of affairs between \u25a0 the \u25a0 countries
does not belong to any Embassador,
but 'the two men responsible for their
relations are Lord Lansdowne and Mr.
Hay. I have never been called â¢ into
the presence of the King or his illus
trious consort without finding them
also full of friendship for the country
I represent. The King's Instincts for
peace are" unerring and his genius for
conciliation perfect, as he has shown
the world In recent weeks." '.
Before concluding Mr. Choate paid a
tribute to Whitelaw Reid, his successor
as Embassador at the court of St.
James, and read from his recent speech
In' New York as a worthy introduction
of the new Embassador. He said the
British people would, find that his suc
cessor and old friend "had been ajife
leng advocate of friendly/ relations be
t\voen s (Great* Britain and the United
States'. V ,
Mr. Choate will be formally called
to the bench of the Middle Temple on
May. 9. when it is expected King Ed-
Trard, . who .fe .' also a bencher,, will be
present. v This is a purely, private; func-

Nearly the entire population of the,;

The pack train was the cause of a
serious accident about a mile from the
hotel. Dr. McAlester of New York,
who has been. living at the Springs for
the. benefit of , his health, was driving
a fractious * horse, which became un
manageable' when,, it saw the train
and. dogs. The doctor's vehicle was
overturned and suffered a com
pound fracture of the -left: leg above
the knee. Word was sent to the hotel
and Dr. .".Lambert responded. - ; i He
treatf d the injured, man as best he
could and ordered him brought -to the

he is looking as well as he; says > he
feels. He wears a 1 thick .covering of
tan, which is. not. particularly: becom
ing, but shows ruggedness. ; . .
; The hunt has; been remarkably, suc
cessful, "considering the fact ithat ,the
party had ) less than one : week *' of \u25a0 good
weather. During -the balance^ of â¢ the;
time the hunters were huddled around
campflres, trying- to get-away . : ; from 1
the severe storms that made ; life inu the '
wilds anything : but ',; pleasant, y- From
Monday until : Friday r . night, oij; this'
week' rain -or snow, ; and sometimes
both, , fell " .continually in the West

froze on the trails and made them im
passable most of the time. Regardless

yesterday^ and several ' bobcats \w6re

The resort at 198 Stevenson street
was run by W. Nolan. Nineteen were
captured in this place. Notices were
found on the side walls to the effect
that bets would be received on the
. Eastern races. Long after the raid
had been made people rang up the
place and asked that bets should be
made for them. The calls were an
swered by a deputy sheriff.
Foreman Andrews denies that the
two notorious women . examined yes
terday gave any evidence that would
show that Mayor Schmitz had any in
terest in the resort at 620 Jackson
street. The allegations of the noto
rious "Nellie Burgess" were treated
with contempt by the entire Jury.
the poolsellers. This belief was sub
stantiated by a report turned in to
the Grand Jury on the resort at 105
O'Farrell street.
The report stated that Policeman
Cornelius Cregan had been seen in a
room adjoining the one in which bets
were t;iken. This resort is reported
to be controlled by Harvey &"Daroux.
Ko policeman was ' present when the
raid was made.
"I maintain." declared Andrews,
"that pool-selling could not exist for
fifteen minutes if the police were not
standing In with it."

immediate control of the office.
\u25a0 ."It has been a matter of no little dif
ficulty to flnd a suitable and competent
man to accept the position owing to the
relatively small salary, the heavy pre
mium for a surety bond and the great
responsibilities of the office. One gen
tleman to whom it was tendered de
clined the *?lace for these reasons and
because he would have no discretion in
the appointment of his clerks (they be
ing all selected from the civil service
lists), yet would be liable for any of
their errors or delinquencies.
"Your kindness in thus publicly call
ing my attention to McCabe's reported
intoxication is greatly appreciated, as
it affords me opportunity, to take im
mediate steps to rectify the situation.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 7.â Private
advices received here from Paris say
that the Governor General of Indo-
Chlna, Beau, reports that the renewed
Japanese complaints of violation, of
French neutrality., are unfoundedJ After
leaving Kamranh Bay, Admiral \ Ro
jestvensky stopped no wjiere in French
territorial waters more than twenty

to the Russian fleet is being investi
gated.

VICTORIA, B. C May 6.â Mail ad
vices from Japan include an epitome
of opinions, of Chinese statesmen wired
from Peking to the Tokio Asashi to the
effect that Chinese officials would not
consider it a wise step on the part of
Japan to Insist on the opening of Man
churia. The officials state it to be the
intention of China to station 50,000
troops in Manchuria when peace is 're
stored. They say China will : not seek
the intervention of a third ( power? to
settle the Manchurian question, . but
fear that the powers will 'intervene
with disadvantage to both Japan' and
China.

KUROPATKIN TO. RETURN.
TOKIO. May 6.â Although none have
been sighted, it is believed that the
larger vessels of the Vladivostok squad
ron accompanied" the torpedo-boats
which appeared west of Hokkaido yes
terday. It Is doubted that torpedo
boats would venture across unescorted
in the heavy sea which was running
when they burned the sailing vessel.
All the crew of this vessel except the
captain, who was captured, succeeded
In landing, but a steamship dispatched
to the rescue of the burning derelict,
was forced to return on account of the
storm. The Russians poured kerosene
on the deck of the sailing vessel, and
â¢withdrew after having ignited the sur
face of the oil.
Toklo Believes All of the Vladivostok
'i Ships Are at Sea.
General's Failing Health Is Assigned
as the Reason.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 6.â The ru
mors of the approaching return of Gen-
ST. PETEP.SBURG. May Câ Admiral
TsebogatofTs junction with Vice Ad
miral Rojestvensky is now considered
by the Admiralty as practically as
sured, and hope for a successful . Issue
In the approaching struggle for mas
tery of the sea is greatly encouraged.
Jsebogaton* is regarded as the Blucher
of the situation, and, indeed, he is said
to resemble Blucher greatly in tem
perament. He may lack his strategy
and finesse, but. like the Prussian, he
lias bulldog courage and is a born
fighter, who goes straight for the en
emy.
- If Vice Admiral Kamimura, like
Grouchy at Waterloo, fails to prevent
a juncture of the Russian fleets, as the
Admiralty here believes is the case,
the impression Is strong that Vice Ad
miral Tojo will not dare risk an open
battle against the united divisions of
â¢Rojestvensky and Xebogatoff, but .will
protect himself by torpedo attacks and
possibly a long-range action, being pre
pared to draw off In the event that he
is unable to make an impression.
Naval officers are prepared to see
Rcjestvensky lose half his convoys, but
in" face of the united divisions it is be
lieved that Togo will accomplish little
or nothing in the way of opposition to
the advance to Vladivostok, and that
he must be content with the aid of the
army and make Vladivostok another
Port Arthur. If the fleet reaches Vlad
ivostok intact, however, r.aval offlcere
here claim that victory is won. Al
though there is little more than 100.000
tons of coal at Vladivostok, with the
reinforcement of the fleet by the Gro
rnoboi. the Rossia, the Bogatyr and the
torpedo-boats now in the harbor they
claim that Rojestvensky could drive
Togo off the sea and leave Oyama's
army stranded :r. Manchuria.
There is a strong intimation that Ro
jestvensky has something up his sleeve
which may prove a surprise. This pos
sibility is a diversion In the form of the
dispatch of some fast converted cruis
ers into the Pacific Ocean to raid upon
Japanese commerce.
Simultaneously with the increasing
tension over the approach of a sea bat
tle comes the news that Marshal Oya
ma is pressing the Russian right along
the Liao River north of Fakoman, as
Bars Rojestvensky's Passage In Direc
tion of Vladivostok.
MANII.A, May 6.â A1l American
naval officers here, including the cap
tains of at" least two United 1 States 1 bat-.
tleshlps and 'the commanders- of /three
cruisers, believe that a sea." fight .be
tween" the Japanese fleet under. Admiral
Kamlmura and the Baltic squadron Is
imminent. Tt Is no secret here that
KamimuraV ships | have "been for = two
weeks at least in the China Sea, cover
ing-the only 'two -channels ;by^which
Rojestvensky can hope to enter the
waters directly-south of Formosa. .
It , is probable. \ that ., Rear /Admiral
Train and his successor, Rear Admiral
Relter, are well acquainted \ with .the
; exact strength of Kamimura's : squad
ron. This is ; assumed to be" true from
\ the fact that the gunboat El Cano, the
torpedo: boats Barry; arid, Bainbridge.
the dispatch boat '; Frolic and -Uie
cruiser. Cincinnati have been active in
the last' two weeks in 1 the \u25a0 waters ex
tending west from Manila* to the Mac
clesfleld ! banks. "-' It is the unanimous
opinion of ~ the various commanders
that the moment Rojestvensky actually
moves from his present station Kam
imura practioally will be in a position
to attack. 'â¢\u0084 â¢
It is conceded that Manila is the
chief base of information for Kaml
mura. It is not Improbable that he is
informed daily of the Russian's move
ments. Every naval officer here says
there is no hope that the Russian ad
miral can escape the notice of the
Japanese ships guarding "the two
channels to the northeast.

FENSHUSHHIEN, Manchuria, May
6.â Field Marshal Oyama seems ready
to assume the offensive on a large scale
and activity already has begun on Gen
eral Linevitch's left. This may be the
prelude to another general battle. The
Japanese have concentrated heavy col
umns on the LiaO' River and their ad
vance divisions have been in contact
with the Russians, who are holding the
main road from Fakom'an and Ba
shienchen.
On Thursday the Japanese cavalry
suddenly attacked the Cossacks in
overwhelming force, forcing the latter
to retire. Then, supported by infantry,
the Japanese advanced and drove the
Russian infantry out of the village of
Palitoun.
A Russian reconnoitering party twen

bush and all except five were killed.

Polish Socialist Party Tells Men to
Return to Work.
WARSAW, May 6.â The Polish So
cialist" party has J. issued a manifesto
calling on the workmen to return to
work and declaring that, while never
before in the history of the world had
a city witnessed a more impressive
manifestation of united workers than
did Warsaw on May day, the time has
not yet : arrived to* start a; revolution.
Therefore the workmen should prepare
themselves for the final struggle for
freedom and return to work with the
6ame*unity as they had struck when 1
ordered to.
The manifesto also declares that "the
workmen desired to maintain order on
May. day, and the bloodshed was oc
casioned solely, by the brutality and
stupidity of the.' hirelings of despot-
Ism." :: Â§Â£>||1 * ;"Â« r*- ;-'\u25a0â¢';:\u25a0' "'

'That -"Pat" Crowe Is , in the city of
Omaha was as much of a surprise to
Chief of Pollci Donahue aa to the
other-citizens of the city." He said to
dayTthat he had taken steps to appre
hend r ; the /.'fugitive and> had placed a
large"; detail of detectives, on: the case.
::^: :^ When Crowe appeared'at the . office
qf a ; local' newspaper last night he was
dressed in a neatly fitting business
fluit 1 and was in a talkative mood. His
conversation at times carried l^, mix
ture of the slang contracted by long
companionship with the 'class of men
with .whom he had ', been associated.
Generally, * however, he spoke in a
rather cosmopolitan manner arid
avoided ? racy languSge. ,
. Crowe displayed the markof a"bul
â¢ Jet ;.wound*invthe shoulder, which he
declared . he had ; received - during his
"service In the Boer army. Be' says he
served but three weeks with the Boers,
his wound making it necessary for
him 'to leave Jhe army. He -went to
Durban, thence '.to . London, â¢ and re
turned to^the United States, stopping
three" weeks In 'New* York' and thenco
going to Chicago, where he has since
: resldedr* v ' . .
;E. A; Cudahy, who paid the $25,000
ransom for the return -of his ' son and
who offered a large reward for Crowe
: at the time of the kidnaping, said:
V"I have not heard from Crowe for
about : three months. Crowe sent ; a
friend to Chief of "Police Donahue and
; asked for immunity from punishment
If. he should voluntarily v I
I told Donahue that I would notrecom
! mend lenfency for Crowe "or do any
' thing to shield hlm.^ On the contrary,
I 1I 1 stated ;at the " time, arid I repeat
' now.' that'if Crowe should surrender
, or be captured I shalllend any assist
ance in my power to prosecutte him
tin' the same manner that I would, in
I the case .of any,. criminal."^,, ..,

' NEW YORK, May Â«.â The* Financier

loans as the result of stock market
liquidation, r a smaller transaction 'in

was $Â£,780.200. .follow! og $9,392,800 in the'

"the almost continual, liquidation In se r

STATEMENT
FOE OF KINGS

Secretary Taft > argued against the
contention that it was necessary to ad
mit Chinese to the Philippines in, or
der to build up the islands. There was
a deep feeling against' the Chinese, of
whom - there are now 60,000 in the
archipelago. ; Filipino labor,, he was
confident, was capable of . being
trained effectively for the development
of the islands. While the islands may
develop more slowly with Filipino: la
bor, that development, ihe said, would
be much more advantageous to them.
WASHINGTON, May 6.â SecreUry
of War Taft, former Governor of the
Philippines, talking informally before
the National Geographical Society
about conditions in the archipelago,
replied to" criticisms that have been
made by Englishmen of the adminis
tration and conditions existing In the
islands. The criticisms were to the
effect that the American Government
spent too much money in education;
alleged there were too many public
officers there ; referred to the lack? of
good roads; \ criticized ' the civil ser
vice; thought that- the -Government
was too expensive,' and referred to the
Question of /Chinese Immigration.
The Secretary replied with vigor,'
declaring that In view of the peculiar
conditions existing they were not well
founded. .
TAFT ANSWERS
FOREIGN CRITICS
A fourth letter ; left by the woman
was found, which was addressed to
"Charles Sweetheart," and read in
part as follows:
.;. *'I love you better, than my life. I
love you so much, and to think I have
to go and' leave you! I hate -to die.;
The â¢ little , I have ; af ter =my '\u25a0\u25a0 bills are
paid I wish to be sent to i Olivia \u25a0 Par-
"Again and again have you disap
pointed me, Charley. What In God's
name have I done? If you were"anx
ious to get rid of me that were easy.
Why did you have me come to New
.York? Here I am as your 'wife. If
you had said, 'Ollie, I don't. want. you
to return,' I would never have done
so. Well, Charley, this Is the last.. l
\u25a0wish you all the- luck in- the world."
Here the writer seemed to have
paused again.' It resumed:
"How I . am suffering! I cannot
stand it any longer. It is now past 4
o'clock."
" A Becond letter was addressed to a
storage warehouse, this , city. The
third was Inclosed and written on* two
sheets of paper. It appe axed that one
portion had been written , yesterday
afternoon and the other sheet early to
day before the woman shot herself.
One letter began:
â¢ "Dear Sweetheart: When I called
you up on the telephone you talked so
cruelly to me that I went out and
bought a revolver, Intending to do it
then. I was brought up in a convent
and my religion teaches against such
thing-.?, but I can't stand it any
longer."
Here there was a break In the let
ter and when it was continued It was
with a different ink:
The woman left four letters, one of
them being sealed,* addressed to
"'Charles H. Stoneham,- 44 Broadway."
On the back of the sealed letter was
written: "I wish that no one would
open this but the person addressed."
None of the hotel employes remem
ber having seen Gray during the night
and he could not be found around the
hotel at the time of the shooting. The
suite occupied by the Grays was the
finest on the Broadway side of the
hotel.
Accompanied by a man a few years
her senior the woman appeared at the
Imperial on April 20. The couple reg
istered as "J. W. Gray and wife. New
Orleans." They' went out frequently
together and the man was away dur
ing the day, but there was nothing
about them to excite unusual Interest.
.While the watchman was making the
rounds to-day he heard a muffled re
port, like a pistol shot in the room oc
cupied by the Grays. Looking over the
transom the watchman Baw the woman
lying on her face oh the floor beside
the bed, with her hands outstretched.
She was in her night dress and a
stream of blood was flowing from an
ugly wound In her right temple. She
was alone in , the room.
He expressed ignorance of the wo
man and declared that newspaper men
brought him the first news he had re
ceived of the tragedy. â¢
"She may have been a customer of
our firm and in that way may have ac
quired my address," Stoneham said.
VThe name is not at all familiar to me,"
and I do not think we had such a per
son In New Orleans as a customer."
Mr. Stoneham declined to discuss his
whereabouts during the day. He was
emphatic however. In his denial that
he had ever been at the Hotel Imperial
with Mrs. Gray and declared he had
been at his home *at night for many
weeks.
After being absent from his office at
44 Broadway to-day Charles H. Stone
ham, a broker of this city, who is be
lieved to be the person to whom the
letters were addressed, and so declared
by the New York friends of the dead
woman, returned late to-night to his
home in Jersey City. He denied that
he knew Mrs. Gray or that he was con
nected with her' case in any way.
"I never heard of the , woman," he
said.
NEW YORK. May 6.â The police of
this city are puzzled to-night by a new
turn taken in the case of Mrs. J. W.
Gray, said to be the widoW of a
wealthy Chicago broker, who commit
ted suicide in her apartments In the
Imperial Hotel to-day. The woman
left letters addressed to Charles H.
Stoneham, telling him of her love and
declaring his cruelty, in a conversation
with her over the telephone had In
duced her to take her life.

lion of multiple marriages by "Blue
beard" Johann Hoch came during the
trial to-day when Assistant State At
torney .Olsen asked that the marriage
laws of Pennsylvania be admitted in
evidence as a preliminary to the testi
mony of Detective Edward Gorman of
Philadelphia, who was best man at the
marriage of Hoch and Caroline
Epreicher in Philadelphia, a short time
before Hoch came to Chicago.
The object of this move, according
to Assistant State Attorney Olsen, was
a desire to prove that Hoch after mar
rying Caroline Spreicher had left her,
had taken all her savings with him
and had come to Chicago and married
Mrs. Walcker. This testimony, it was
claimed, would tend to show that the
motive Hoch had in killing Mrs.
Walcker-Hoch was to secure her
money, as it is alleged he had in
the case of his other wives. Judge
K-ereten granted the request and Gor
man was allowed to take the stand.
Gorman testified that he had been
present as best man at the marriage
cf Hoch. whom he kj^ew as John
Bchmidt, to Caroline Spreicher at
Philadelphia on October 20, 1804. Gor
man Bald that Hoch lived with the
woman for ten days and then suddenly
left the State.
Lyte H. Parsons, paying teller of the
Home Savings Bank of this city, where
both Mrs. Walcker-Hoch and her
eister, Mrs. Fischer-Hoch, had their
savings on deposit, testified that on
December 15, 1904. Hoch called at the
bank with Mrs. Walcker-Hoch and
â¢withdrew all the savings of Mrs.
Walcker-Hoch, amounting to 5270.
On January 19, 1906, Hoch, accord
ing to Parsons, appeared at the bank
egrain, this time with Mrs. Fischer-
Hoch, and withdrew all the money on
deposit "belonging: to Mrs. Fischer-
Hoch, amounting to $760.
Tobias B. Musser, a bartender at a
Ealgon where Hoch bought seltzer wa
ter for Mrs. Walcker-Hoch, testified
that Hoch had told him that his wife
had been sick for eight years and that
he had lost three children during that
time. Musser stated that on the day
after Mrs. Walcker-Hoch's death Hoch
came to the saloon and returned two
bottles of seltzer water, with the re
mark, "Well, she is dead and I don't
need this any more."

California also ships.- of its own
products many tons of freight: per
i month, as alsp do Oregon and Wash
; ington. This business is constantly
i. being stimulated and with the Middle
West shipments form the major, part
of outbound â¢_ cargoes. Atlantic '/\u25a0 sea
i board shipments to : the Orient via
transcontinental j lines, during time of
peace, have not been of sufficient im
portance to cut any great figure in: the
business of the port of San Francisco.
; Regarding the trade of Central and
I South America, low Panama -rates and
i the completion of the canal will effect
j no doubt the shipments of coffee -from
Central America and some shipments
!to and from South- America. South
i America has not been a heavy pur
! chaser of California products , other
than mining machinery, which business
can be held. Central America buys
mining machinery, powder, wines and
some food products from California,
but little else. The Germans have been
doing most of the heavy .business , /with
Central . America and have been able to
undersell all classes of American -man
ufactures.' The loss of "the coffee; trade
to California will not be very great, as
a large ; quantity of Central / American
coffee is used west of the Rocky Mount
tains Varid will always be\ distributed
from ' San Francisco. 'The c6ffee/ r for
transshipment p has : been 'a / source ; of
profit to the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company,/ but Jlt| has not been the
means of creating much labor and the"
consequent distribution of money. /It
is also; very /likely that the Southern
Pacific ; Company will adj ust ; Its ' rates
on east-bound 'coffee jlf jits steamship
connections I demand . It,' so ,- that \lt will
be just as cheap to handle It for distri
bution in Atlantic arid ; / Middle -West
Stafes through :' Sari ; Francisco ras/ to
Â«end it through the canal to the At
lantic ports.- :-'-' â¢ â¢ ' â¢
Those who favor the canal say that
nothing but benefit can come of the
undertaking so far as San Francisco
is concerned. Cheaper rates will give
impetus to California's markets and
even were the State to suffer loss of
some of her "Oriental trade she would
more than make ilt up -by being pro
vided with a far more extensive field
In the Eastern part of the United
States and in, Europe. They say. that
a v large - perceritag* Eof : the business
with the Orient and the United States,
through Sari" Francisco*,": is "with- the
Middle West and that- shipments of
flour, 'canned meats/and 'other staple
products could hot be sent to the \ At

China, Japan,^ Australia or the Phil
ippines as cheaply as if sent direct to
the Pacific Coast and transferred to
steamers there. -
CALL. BUREA*U, POST BUILDINgV
WASHINGTON. May 6.â Secretary
Taft has declared that ; the fates of
the Panama Railroad shall be adjust
ed. ; The 'Government will not assume
the ; ownership^of the steamship lines
plying between the isthmus and New
York and San Francisco and trans
continental 'lines have nothing, to fear.
Notwithstanding /; the Secretary's
words of encouragement the. railroads
are in a very nervous frame of mind.
They profess to think still that the
lowering of Panama Railroad*/ rates
will unsettle transcontinental traffic
and may in j the long run mean a.' dis
astrous rate war. They! have been dis
cussing at length In every railroadof
flce of the East the probable effect of
the digging of the Panama canal, /and
strange to say the majority of the ar
guments presented are that San FraVi
clsco will be sidetracked and will lose
Its Oriental trade as soon as the Pan
ama canal shall have been completed.
The opening of the canal, it is said,
will cause through lines of steamers to
be placed on the run from Oriental
ports and the Philippines direct to
New York and to Europe. There will
be no necessity of shipping freight
from Eastern points to be .exported
from San Francisco to the Far East-
There will be no need for steamship
lines from the Pacific Coast to the lu
crative trade marts of Asia, India and
Australia and the "Golden _ Gate will
set the bars and her merchant marine
will rot in the Oakland estuary." ' r
\u25a0 All this Is discussed withÂ»a serious
ness and a resort to figures that at
first glance Jar on the sensibilities of
a loyal San- Franciscan, who has been
accustomed to Panama talk and -j lis
tened through many years to the pray
ers of California shippers for a canal
and competition.- In theory the*rail
road people have advanced a good ar
gument, which many of the national
legislators have been inclined to swal

\ . Gentlemen : \ Replying to your -favor
of the 2d inst., we desire to correct the
numerous > errors. made in the attempt
to define the ; attitude : of this club in
; the \ matter of the conversion of your
Sutterr street * system on Sutter, '. Polk,
i Post, Larkin and Ninth streets and Pa
i clflc avenue into a conduit system.
. The position assumed: by. your, com
pany- in our numerous discussions has
not been that you "could not" but that
you "would not" reconstruct the cable
road into a conduit electric systeny al
though this club' offered to employ the
best ; electrical; engineers in the United
States; and prove to you that, such a
system- would be economical and ! suc
cessful in its operation on these streets
and would more. than amply repay for
the outlay.
.In; considering this matter we have
nlway's treated the Sutter street system
in its entirety, recognizing that the in
terests of the people along 'the entire
line are one, : and at no time have we
expressed' a willingness to treat It sec
, tJonally, although you have always en
deavored to do so. ;

hension ;in assuming, that this club .has
at any time consented to ; eliminate, the

While we recognize that your fran
chise permits you to operate a cable
road and that, because of the absence
of dangerous overhead wires and un
sightly poles, such a system is pref
erable' to an overhead trolley, we still
contend that the service given by a

society forbade him forgiving the In
jury inflicted upon his face by Mr.
Schneider's fist, because ne firmly be
lieved that the face of no man would
be safe from similar assault if Mr.
Schneider were allowed to go unde
terred by prison experience from com
mitting it.
With fulsome assurance from Judge
Cabaniss that the blind goddess in No.
4 was opaquely bandaged and influ
enced solely by the testimony adduced
and the provisions of the Penal Code,
Mr. Ebert narrated his grievance.
While Beated in the restaurant, he said,
his attention was monopolized by the
viands in i?ont of him until Mr.
Schneider, at an adjoining table, at
tracted it by loudly complaining to the
proprietor of the cafe anent the ob
jectionable quality of some of the
patrons there being served. There was
no sretiine away from cognizance of
the fact that the complaint especially
referred to Mr. Ebert, for Mr. Schnei
der's allusions were sharply pointed at
that ' gentleman's nationality. Mr.
Ebert, ' after satisfying himself that
he was the target for Mr. Schneider's
.-.disparaging arraignment, turned his
head and uttered mild remonstrance,
to which Mr. Schneider retorted by
smiting Mr. Ebert's nose with his fist.
'Und he drawed der claret," added
Mr. Ebert.
Mr. Schneider's plea was that of
.provocation that no self-respecting
person could withstand. "He had trou
ble with another man before I tackled
him." said Mr. Schneider, "and his
table manners - were so bad that I
couldn't help handing him a bit of my

"But be alleges that you handed him
a bit of your fist also," remarked the
Judge. "The question is. Did you strike
fetal?"
**Well,"said Mr. Schneider, reflective
ly. *T may have hit him, but I didn't
strike him."
"Would you prefer an Immediate
sentence of forty-eight hours' impris
onment to a continuance until Mon
day?" inquired the Judge.
"It's up to you," responded Mr.
Schneider.
â¢ "Well, the sentence goes,** said his
Honor. "I suggested the continuance
because I desired to spend the interim
in ascertaining the difference, if any
exists, between the terms 'strike' and
'hit,* as they are applied in complaints
of assault.*'
"You might as well find that out
anyway,", said Mr. Schneider.
"That's bo, too," said the Judge.
Mr. Ebert neither. Indorsed nor dis
approved the court's punishment of

All this week the Big Injun, who tips
the scales at 455 pounds, -is to appear in
a one-act farce arranged for him entitled
"The Unknown." This amateur actor is
seven feet tall and eats the regular aver
age quantity for three men. -He has
proven an attractive feature during, the
past week, the theater being crowded
nightly. In addition to Jumbo, the In
dian giant, there Is an attractive double

One ol the most interesting lnnova
f tions in connection with book publishing
has been the distribution by The Outlook
Company of specimen volumes of the new
aapum opes of world-history, "The
2i:storiar.s' History of the World." Read
ers of advertisijig during the past year
have noted The Outlook's offer to send to
Â«ny appiicant a specimen bound volume
of this work. This new world-history
consists of 25 volumes. Each volume
v.-cJshs four pounds. The publishers dis
covered that the express companies have-
B rate for carrying books which is in di
rect competition with the postal rates for
the same sort of merchandise. It was
on account of this relatively law rate
that The Outlook Company were enabled
to make good their offer to send, by ex
press, a specimen volume. Applications
were received from 60.000 persons and
li't,? l^ ?; h0 hves in U>s Angeles or
.Portland. Oregon, was in exactly as rood

Outlook sent him a polite reminder that
he had not returned the volume, he re
plied as follows:
"Of course I supposed that the book
was a gift to me. I considered it a very
graceful act on your part, but my pleas
ure :s completely marred by your con
duct in asking for it back. *In any case
I cannot comply with your request, for I

1 <1o not think it would be much good to i
you. for I have written his name in iti
with my best wishes for his future wel
fare, and I have marked passages which
1 think he should read most carefully"
It was discovered that there ie a class
of apparently decent and respectable per
sons who considered the book a thing to
l>e punished. Th*y treated It worse than '
a door mat. Thpy used it as a lamp !
stand, aa a plaything in the nursery, as
r foot-reft and for various other domes
tic purposes. From one applicant there
was received back a parchment- bound
volume so greatly disfigured that an ex
perienced publisher would hardly have
recognized it as a book. It had some
what the shape of a sponge. The
parchm'int binding had practically dis
appeared and the leaves were all chewed
at the comers and otherwise mutilated
In this case the blow was somewhat soft
ened by the pleasant letter which the
correspondent sent:'
â¢I regret to say that your handsome
volume foil Into the paws of my bull ter
rier, who has a very inquiring mind and
p. powerful interest In literature. I hope
you will b<? glad to hear that he liked it

with the genuine parchment eovtr. en

Philippicfs. Porto Rleo. India and other
distant and tropical parts. Some of them

One that had been to the Philippine- was
reduced to a mere fragment. The" man
who had received: it sent a note explain- -.

Philippine cockroaches. The Outlook, h
thought, would be Interested to know
that they were the most voracious cock
roaches now known to science. -Jit had
only taken a small party of them one
hour to reduce the book to its present
condition. The matter, he tfiSueht
nhould be brought to the attention of en
tomologists.
From India a specimen volume for

crac back without the cover. The cor- !
respondent explained that In that land
the ants have a passionate liking for
Â»rre-en materials, and the boards of this
volume were covered with a rich ETeen
cloth that fixactly suited their taste ; "
Om: parchment volume came back with
the cover half gone. A letter with It ex
plained that a friend of the writers had
torn a portion of the cover off to aseer
tain if it was genuine sheepskin parch
ment. He thought The Outlook would bh
pleased to know that his friend was en
tirely satisfied as to the genuineness of
the material. .
On the whole, the specimen volume
campaign was a highly Interesting reve
latlon of the eccentricities of human na
ture and of the various ways of regard"
Ing books. The most satisfactory result
of It was that ninety-eight per cent of thn
InÂ«iu!rÂ«tTÂ» returned their volumes -in per

unique plan of getting acquainted with a
new work.
Adventures of a Book.
Franz Kneisel, the leader of . the
quartet which bears his name, is a
.Roumanian who made his first appear
ance in this country in Boston, ln 18S5
! and instantly took front rank as a vio
; linist. For nearly twenty years he was
the concertmaster and assistant con
ductor of the famous Boston Symphony
Orchestra, from which organization' he
and his colleagues resigned' two; years
ago owing to the demands from all
over America and Europe for the serv
ices of the Kneisel Quartet.
Soon after his arrival In Boston Mr.
Kneisel organized his quartet 'and with
the single exception of the second vio
lin, the organization has â¢ remained in
tact. The result is" a quality of. en
tremble work rarely If ever equaled.
During the series, of concerts: to be
jfiven at Lyric Hall during the earning
week and at the Hotel St. Francis, Mr.
Kneisel will confine himself to ensem
ble playing except on Friday night,
when, with Mr. Theodorowicz, he will
play the Bach double Concerto. This
will be a rare treat to our I violin stu
dents. The programmes for all the
appearances of the ; kneisel Quartet
may be obtained at Sherman, Clay &
Co.'s, where the sale "of seats is now
open.
The Mayor is to appoint a staff of
three physicians who are to have
chaise of the hospital. The chief will
get $COOO a year and the two others
52500. The building will be paid for out
of excise money.

tha streets in large measure, it broke
out with great violence in a war of
words between the members of the Em
ployers* Association and the labor
leaders. Charges .. were made also
against, toe police, it beinÂ« said that
from the. outset they have in many
cases favored, the strikers, refusing to
arrest them when they were seen as
saulting non-union men, and losing no
opportunity to taka the latter into cus
tody, whenever it waÂ» possible for
them *to find an excuse : for j doing so.
It is said 'by members of the Employ
ers' Association that captains and"lieu
ten&nts of police. have been derelict In
their duty in the suppression -of tisor
der and . charges \u25a0 are filed against
members of them before the police trial
board. Mayor Dunne â¢ to-night ap
pointed a commission to Investigate
the facts in the dispute. " â
BELIEVES CRISIS IS PAST.
The Mayor to-night expressed . him
self as confident that the serious part '
of the, strike was over and that .there
vrouyx be no- more excitement in the
streets. Sheriff Barrett expressed simi
lar/views and thought there would be
no more fighting and that with the dep.
utles and police the people could be
protected. -
The strike was stimulated somewhat '\u25a0
to-day by a walkout of. the employes!
of several .wholesale ] grocery, houses
that so far have not been concerned in
the trouble. ; Forty-four drivers were
called out. in" three establishments.
Tugmen also Joined the ranks of the
strikers, although there were no fbr
jmaT orders from, fheir.oinjon to do so. j
Â» Mayor. Dunne's-.Â«planitifor> recruiting
the police force with men taken from
the Water Department did not prove a
great success. One, hundred men were
sent in by Superintendent Levering of
the jj Water Department and of these
thirty-eight were chosen for police
duty. Several of * the men de
clared outright that they would not
guard wagons, "while several more said
that they had sore -feet and could not
â¢walk beside the wagons. - Five men as
signed to Inspector Levering resigned
when he .assigned them" to guard a
wagon belonging to Marshall Field &
Co. By night every one of the thirty
eight had been dropped from the rolls
of the Police Department. \
BOCUS BOMB CAUSES SCARE.
A story that a dynamite bomb was
hurled at a United States Express
wagon at Weat Van Buren . and Des
plaines streets last night was sent out
from the Desplaines street police sta
tion to-day. Special Agent Eddy of the
express company says no bomb was
thrown nor was the wagon damaged.
Three arrests were made, one ' of ithe
men taken into custody being formally
accused of assault with a deadly
weapon. -'. * ;
Special Agent Eddy saldt "The al
leged bomb was nothing ' but a blue
powder Inclosed in a breakiable^bag.
It was thrown at one of bur wagons
and struck the side of the seat. A
blue powder spattered on one. of our
drivers, but he was not hurt Two of
our secret service men witnessed the
act from the sidewalk and kept watch
of a saloon into which the man who
threw the bag ran. v Then they sum
moned the police and he -was arrested.
He will be prosecuted for violating the
j United States injunction. The prisoner,
[ Julius Hildebrand, is the son of a let
ter" carrier."

a shot from the pistol of an irate hus
band, had made his escape from the
hospital at Martinez and was not on
hand when the case was called In
court. Hall was shot by Pearl Fris

liberties' with . his wife. The bullet
took effect in Hall's shoulder and was
of such a nature that it was thought

A Well-Known Rancher of So-

Him of a Bleeding Tumor

nounced Him Incurable.
MR. PETER C. ANDERSON. '
"My nocnÂ« doctors In Petaluma care np
. my case and sent me to San Francisco' to un-
cerro a curpical operation for a blf-edins tumor
of the bladder. I was about dead, but as I
thought there was only one chance and that
was throurh surpery. I took my physician's
advice and packed my clothes and went to
one of the leading hospitals of San Francisco
prepared to take, my chances upon the operat-
ing table. After the consultation of the Â«ar-
geon* in 'the noeaital. they told my wife th*t
I bad only one chance in a hundred to live
through th* operation. That seemed to us no
chacce at all and before taking such a rreat
risk, my wl!Â« asd I decided that we would
Â«4ve the Electro-Chemlc treatment a trial be- *
Jcre undergoing- the operation. We fÂ«-lt that

in a. condition to undergo the operation laMr
If it proved absolutely necessary. I rrew
stronger under the Electro-Chemlc treatment
from the beginning: and I am very rlad Indeed
to say that this wonderful new treatment cured
cm perfectly and made surrlcal treatment un-
necessary. I had tost so much blood and I
was so near dead that I feel that the shock
of surgical treatment would have finished me,
and ito think . that I . bave be-en thoroughly
cured at a small expense with absolutely no
twin makes me feel grateful to the physicians
vof UÂ« EJectro-Cfeeniic; Institute. !It stems
stranee that my wife should also be attacked
by *rhs.t ray home physicians pronounced an
Incurable trouble except through a â¢ surrlcal
operation. We considered the matter care-
fully -and we decided that before undertaking-
Â»<urÂ«;ic&l treatment, we would see what Elec-
tro-ChemUtry would do for my wife and she
(s now in Sea Francisco usderrolnr treatment
at the Electro-Chemlc Institute at 118 -Grant
avenue, a am clad to aay that my wife is
Improving steadily and I bave every reason to
believe that Electro-CcemUtry will make a .
surgical . operation in her case ali>o unneces-
sary. lam cure that my wife would be $Ud
to "haTeany one call upon her that mtzht be
interested in her treatment and my cure by
Electro-Cbemlitry. My home is at Peuns
- Grove, tl* adlea outside of Petaluma. and
t.ny one mar call upon me or write ire re-
sardlng my cure and ,the present treatment
of my wife by the Electro-Chemlc Specialists.

With these things in mind, the sons
of the fatherland will gather to-day
in every civilized city of the world to

From the heart of Germany to the far
thest bounds of the earth many of the
poet's own words will be re-echoed,
ivhiie the greatest of the Rhineland's
eons will join with the least in honor

PARADE THIS 3IORNIXG.
One hundred yeers ago occurred the
death of Johann Christoph Friedrich
yon Schiller, joet and philosopher of
Germany, in the little village of Wei
mar, but the deep and impressive ap
peals of the poet and the wise sayings
of the philosopher still find echo in
the hearts of Germany's eons and
daughters wherever the language of
the fatherland is spoken! Born of hum
ble parentage and inured to poverty,
the career of Schiller stands as an in
spiration to the youth of every land.
Adversity served but to increase the
brilliancy of his genius and poverty the
strength of his perseverance Through
cut his life there was no taint upon
his character. His affection for his
wife and the bond of friendship be
tween him and the great Goethe were
poems as beautiful as any the man of
genius ever penijed.

fashion, while the ultra fashionables of
the two bay cities parsed greetings on
the clubhouse lawn and verandas. The
sport was not marred by accident or
unpleasant Incident, and the season of
ISO 4-5 fades away a happy vision of
the past.
To be sure, the Farewell cup, decided
over two and a quarter miles, and the j
$1600 purs* caught the eyes 'of the
horsemen, but many were, attracted by
the match race between the two pigmy
ponies, Kickapoo and Chesi. The form
er, owned by Mrs. C Stubenbord Jr.,
is about as big as a minute, while
Chesi Is two seconds smaller, or a story
cd a half taller than a German Dachs
hund.
CRICKET KELLY PILOTS CHESI.'
Chesi. ridden by "Cricket" Kelly, tip
ping the scales at TO pounds, sported
the colons of Thomas H. Williams Jr..
the 3-year-old son of the Jockey club's"
president. Ab ttte youngest owner in
the country climbed the stairs to the
stewards stand over the judges' stand
attired In Newmarket coat, stiff hat, a
pair of binoculars . strapped over his
shoulder and proudly wearing an own
er's badge that looked like a Fourth of
July cartwheel, he received a routing
reception -from the occupants of the
6tan<L He returned the courtesy by
tipping his hat, and his advent on the
turf can be voted a marked success.
No betting was permitted on ! the
match. Kickapoo, ridden by Master
Harty, another 70-pound rider, proved
too fleet of foot for ChesL The distance
was one-sixteenth of a mile, and the
diminutive racers ran on nearly even
terms for fifty yards. Then Kickapoo
drew away, scoring easily without the
customary use of lash "and steel. A
magnificent silver cup was the trophy
earned by the winner.
"In the other events only two choices,
Possart and Collector Jessup, were
successful. The books did an immense
business.
ELIE TAKES CUT RACE.
Somewhat cool weather augured
against any record breaking in the
Farewell cup. the stellar feature of the
afternoon. Soufriere, with C. Miller
up. had a decided call in the betting
and went down to defeat, Elie, from
the stable of C. Stubenbord Jr., piloted
by Jakle Jones, being the victor. The
war horse Veterano led for nearly two
miles. Then Jones played for the lead
with Elie. Miller now cut loose with
the favorite, but Elie held the mare
safe. paEfiing the judges' stand first
by two lengths in 3:57. Orchan, a con
tender throughout, ran a good third
behind So^frlere. \u25a0
Lamasney Bros.* mar? Christine A
showed to be a good repeater by de
feating Flaunt, favorite for the opening
mile and 100 yard run. Ripper led to
the far turn, where Fountain assumed
the front position with Christine A,
floating in ahead of the first choice,
with considerable in reserve. Wiley on
Sincerity Belle took the show.
POSSART FINISHES FIRST.
Always an excellent weight packer,
Pocsart, the 12 to 5 favorite, extreme
ly well ridden by "Handrldlng" Kelly,
turned up winner of the mile and 100
yards number, with the weights raised
ten pounds above the scale. For a
time it seemed C. Williams, who had
stolen a march on the field with Fol
low Me, would turn the trick. But
when Kelly sat down on Possart it
was all over, the black lessening the
gap of intervening daylight and earn
ing a neck decision. Byronerdale
grew weary, dropping the show to
Glenrice.
Royalty, the 9 to 5 favorite for the
mile and a Quarter selling affair,
failed to receive a call. Budd Wade,
a. 9 to 1 chance, piloted by Frank Sul
livan, overhauled the pacemaker, Ma
jor' TÂ«nny, in the run home, winning
by half a length. Iras ran third.'
Any one of the seven starters In the
mile and a sixteenth event for three
year-olds could be conceded a chance
and the bookmakers kept the prices
pretty "well- down. Herbert rode a
careful race on Gloomy Gus, a liberal
ly played 10. to 1 shot, finishing almost
two lengths ahead of Edgecllff.at the
end. Bailey outgamed Clondlight,
taking show honors.
With the field reduced to four
starters In the concluding mile purse
run,., it looked as, If _ Col lector Jessup
might have things his own way. He
ruled a stanch choice and the last six
teenth of the Jonrneyiwas fully, ex
tended to beat Gateway less than',' a
length. Funnyelde ran a good -third.
Twenty-five , bookmakers chalked up
odds in the big ring, beating Jail past
_ record* for. the closing of a' season.':

away from the courts and compara
tively few matches were played. By far
the most interesting match was a dou
bles between Drs. Hill and McChesney
and George Janes and Harry Rolfe.
The former won two sets out of three,
the score being 3-6, Bt6,8 t 6, 6;1. The young
sters played great tennis the first two
sets, the first of which they won easily.
Rolfe did some excellent lobbing, while
Janes was; strong in overhead: work.
Rolfe and Janes had t a; lead , of 5-4 in

The greatest score \u25a0on either side was
made by R. Gilman 'Brown, who was
10 up, or 5% points, in his match

PRESIDIO TEAM
IS VICTORIOUS
GIANTS ROUTED
BY BEANEATERS
Parsons, the University of Southern
California sprinter, electrified the spec
tators at Berkeley oval yesterday by
his marvelous ..burst of speed in the
short-distance events. r
â¢ He won the classic "hundred" in
10 seconds and the "220" in 22 1-5
seconds. Two watches caught 9 4-5
.seconds for the hundred-yard race.
Twenty-five j-ears ago Bob Haley of
the Olympic Club was credited with
better than even time and since then
no coast athlete has been able to
equal it. is-
Parsons is built in ideal lines for a
runner, resembeling Victor Schieffer
â¢ irtein. the great sprinter of the early
â¢SO's, xn a marked degTee.
Enedigar was first to show In the
hundred after -a good start by George
James. He held a slight lead for
eeventy yards, after which Parsons '
outfinished him, breasting the tape first
by a foot.
Parsons made his first essay on a
curved track in the 220-yard race, his
previous efforts in the south being con
fined to straightaway courses. Snedi-
Bar was again the first to show in the
lead and it appeared he had his op
ponent beaten. Parsons was fully four
yards behind entering the stretch.
Once straightened out for home he put
on a terrific burst of speed, winning by
nearly two yards.
When in action Parsons has an exag
e?erated sprinter's face, which is
ehown in the photograph of the race.
Norman E. Dole. Stanford's great
pole vaulter, shared the honors of the
day with Parsons. He sailed over the
bar at 11 feet 9 inches, a height twice
as great as that of his athletic body.
The bar was finally raised to 12 feet
thi inches! This was higher than his
world's record. 9ie made several at
tempts at it, but failed. The pole vault
proved the most interesting event on
the programme. Dole, especially, is a
master of the art and flew over the
pole far above the ground as grace
fully as a bird." 1
Enedigar of thÂ« University of Cali
fornia closed the day's competition by
establishing a new coast record for the
broad Jump. He ; cleared 2S feet '
.7.92-100 inches, replacing Braughton's
record of 23 feet 4 Inches, which has
stood for some years. The summary:

""Man may live L^-pplly and usefully
for 150 /years," said , ;Dr. lÂ»yman
Beecher Sperry of Oberltnr Ohio, at the
Young Men's Christian Association
Hall the crther afternoon. "After a
\ thlrdfof a century of 'scientiflo study
! such is my conclusion. Yet in the face
; of ; my t belief \u25a0 2 0 per cent lof -. the hu- j
manT;belngs 'born into, ; thla\world die
before they are a year old,*: 2s; per cent
before - they are 6 \u25a0'. years of age. only
half reach the age of 26 and the aver
age length of f. life is - under 40 years.
The" destructive forces which bring
about this low average are manifold,
but I believe it is possible to enjoy
good health and activity up to a cen
tury -and; a v half by V proper under
standing of the human possibilities and
the exercise of this knowledge,'/ v*
VcDr/ Sperry*s address was the first of
a series of six on the '.'Science of Liv
ing," his sub-topic being "Human Pos
sibilities." His main object, apparent
ly, ..was to r point : out . to â¢ the large au
dience of young men present the influ
ences- .which retard longevity, . with
stress -on the theory that Immorality
has ; a direct .bearing on . the physical
being. ' .; < ...
PITHY SAYINGS. .
The lecture teemed with pithy say
ings, of which the ' following show his
trend of thought :
j "Man 'was not born to struggle from
a helpless cradle to a hopeless grave."
"There is a best way to live, and* it ia
best to live the best way." .. ' '. . . i
/."Mere existence is not worth while, I
but life jis worth the effort if ' one con
tracts neither disease , nor an unfortu
nate marriage." . \u0084 ..\u25a0 ,;_\u25a0'',
"Science teaches that a human being
cannot' die of old age under 150 years."
--"A climate where 'the loin cloth and
a flock of i mosquitoes 1 constitute full
dress is not conducive of human devel
opment", ' : , ,
"A crank ia a man .who. does his own
thinking. l and . has the courage of- his
convictions."
' '.'To maintain the health of the body
is to preserve the health of the soul." *
"The law of heredity is to.be blamed
for a lot of sins, but it has been over
worked.".;^; ;' j ".-.' . , .-,
. "The . responsibility for what we are
depends upon ourselves." ,
"Smiles ' and . pleasant words are the
strongest magnets In the universe."
"Alcohol, from hard cider to wood al
cohol; is ; a devilish delusion."
BELIEVES Df LONGEVITY. \
* v : In his belief 'that - the
human race could - greatly lengthen . its
span of life the speaker was willing to
eliminate Â« all the ;\u25a0 chapters \u25a0_: of Genesis
:- which; tell; of^the.; longevity of: the an>
i dents, : but asserted that he himself
had talked: with persons who. had
reached the i age "of - 135 years. ' ' ;
. '."They were a little mummified.' to be
sure," he said, "but this was due un-~
doubtedly to destructive '- * forces ' of
which I .will, speak..
'.'Science teaches -that ;the \u25a0 human
skeleton develops to perfection in from
twenty-three to twenty-eight years and
that i the span of \u25a0 life \u25a0 should be from
five>toi ten times that Tof the develop
ment !of - the vertebrae. . â¢
: "Offsetting the probable lengths ; of
life â¢ are : such - forces - as v climate, â¢ war,
licentiousness/ use of narcotics and the
ruinous 1 Influence of alcohol." - .
' Climatic conditions, according to Dr.
Sperry, have been reduced to statistics,
proving: beyond doubt that both ' torrid
and' frigid atmosphere tend to shorten
existence. Incidentally the ; residents
of both* hot and cold countries are ad
dicted ' to; Indolence : and this â¢; in itself
was ; declared i to ; shorten '. life. All the
longevity .worth? mentioning/ it ,, was
claimed, existed. in the. temperate zone.
i 'TWar,",; said the speaker, "is a â¢ most
destructive * force, " not â¢ alone because
millions . of men ' have \u25a0 been killed by it.
but because of the. influence on the race
dve '. to sthel loss i of the sstrongest.t t. and
most I enduring of the human f beings." :
â¢ In relation to the destructive force of
evil habits ; Dr. Sperry spoke at length,
andÂ» nls scathing treatment of , drink,
tobacco : and i opium ' was i said to b a de
rived from personal association: with
victims.^-Chicago : Chronicle.

J* Aunt Fanny Lomax, the aged col^
sred woman who only a short time ago
it ' her, residence across ' the river * near ;
3eofgetown celebrated *the one hun-7;
ired / and ,-; \u25a0. fourth anniversary of her
birth,*!,' said one of - Washington's oldest
Inhabitants. 4 ''is a true exa mple of lon
revityr - HerVecords are straight and
her credentials equally as good.', but," \
said he; "she is a case among many
thousands. I have given much study to
the subject of longevity," continued- the/ ,
old gentleman, "and have no hesitation*.
In saying that nine out often of these
centenarians we hear about, many Â« of
them in the almshouaes ' or in country
regions, supported - by their friends or,
their. descendants, do not know Twhen
they were* born, and there are no rec
ords 'extant , to show the date, and
while jmany .'ot them "can remember
events that have occurred sixty or even ,
seventy years ago, they can cary their
mental glances no further to the rear.
t'A great many honors are attendant
upon old age." he went on to say, "ana
I think the feeling of homage is am wen
exemplified by .the Chinese: as by any
other people. In that country If a man
lives over a hundred the universal Im
pression Is that he .must have been a
good man to have been blessed with to
many years of existence, and he has
statues and memorial arches and mon
uments erected to ' his memory. It la to /
be | noted, however, that : these memeaâ
toes 'are few 'and far 'between, for few
men are so good In their, lives as to get
to be 100 years old." , V ,
" .The old resident may have been sub
stantially correct in his assertions, but
the truth, is that r. very, * many peoplo
have lived beyond the/age of 100 years.
In a census of Great Britain taken
about forty years ago it was shown
that 310 ' persons I within the period of
the census had lived to be over 100
years old. ; '\u25a0',:.

tion in bcfpks on longevity. Her'mem
ory was perfect up to the time, o* her
death, and she could . see -to thread a
needle until a year of her being called

Thomas Mag ee & Sons in their Real 1
Estate Circular note the attention that\
is paid by buy ere to parts of the city j
that have been neglected heretofore. '
From this circuznsta&ce is drawn the
. conclusion that buyers are firmly con
vinced of the futureof Saa Francisco.
This view has previously been ex
pressed In the real estate columns of i
this paper. The Real Estate Circular
quotes illustrative Instances that were
afforded in the transactions of the last
month asd the showing is at once in
structive and interesting. ,
Localities that are in the line of rapid
improvement are mentioned as fol
lows: street from Sacra
mento to Washington; North Beach
property from Pacific to North Point."
"The prospects are better for all parts
of the city, whether adapted to resi
dence u&e, warehousing, manufacturing
or business sites for mercantile trans
actions. Out of this grows wide
spread activity and the confidence that
IS leading purchasers to seek sections
for investment in which there has been
less movement than in the centers of
business."
The largest deal in city realty during
the week was reported in this paper
yesterday. This involved the purchase
by the Humboldt Savings Bank of the
Midway Plaisance property on Market

"JACK" IS DEAD, AND MANY

Afier a long chase the Pinkerton*
" -have finally run to earth the man who
"boldly walked into the First National
Bank of this city last September and
attempted to carry off a. bag contain
ing $20,000 in cold. Yesterday .G K.
Mclntosh. cashier of the bank, pos
itively identilied William Barrett In
Portland as the man wanted, and a.
warrant will be issued here for bis ex
' tradition. Barrett is held in Portland
on a charge of having robbed a man
In the Hotel Portland bar of 5135. The
Pinkerton agents in Portland identified
the^ prisoner as the man wanted in this
city, and sent for Cashier Mclntosh to
complete the identification.
â¢ The attempt to rob the First Na
tional Bank was a daring affair, and
attracted' attention throughout â. the
country. One afternoon, while the of
ficials were having a large amount of
gold removed from the bank to an
other institution, a man dressed as a
laborer and supposed to be one of the I
expressmen regularly employed by the
bask to handle its coin walked into the
institution and behind the counter,
â¢where the gold was lying, and. pick- !
Ing up one of the sacks, started out
of the place. Something about the
man's general appearance aroused the
suspicion of Cashier Mclntosh, who
started after the fellow; but by the
time the cashier had reached the street
the man had disappeared up Bush
street. A few minutes later, how
ever, he was found in the Brooklyn
Hotel dining-room, which he had en
tered by way of a side entrance open-
Ing into a small allej' running between
the bank building and the hotel.
Mclntosh grabbed the man, who still
carried the bag of gold, and denounced
him as a thief. But while the. excite
ment was at its height in the dining
room the thief escaped and was soon ,
out of sight, leaving the cashier in pos- ,
session of the stolen coin. \
It is a rule off- the Bankers' Pro- |
tective Association never to relent in
its search for. men who attempt to rob
banking institutions, and the Pinker
tons were soon hotly pursuing this of
fender. They finally located their man j
v iu Nevada and summoned Mclntosh.
but while the latter was certain that
the right man had been located the
, officials of the bank concluded that, in
vfr.w of the fact that they had recov
ered their coin, it would prove an ex
pensive Job to bring the man back to
San Francisco and prosecute him.- So
the plan'for arrest was abandoned. The
Bankers' Association, however, de
cided that punishment should be meted
out, as in other cases, and the Pinker-
I tons were again set on the trail of the
fellow, with the result that he has
now boÂ«n identified and will be brought
; back to San Francisco for triaL
