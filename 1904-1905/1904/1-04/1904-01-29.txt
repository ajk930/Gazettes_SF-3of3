CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. 2S.â George
A. 'Hose, the' defaulting cashier of the
Produce Exchange Bank, which closed
its doors January 22, made a confession
to-night to the County Prosecutor, tell
ing of his method of using the bank's
money, of which he is said to have lost
$187,000. Roffe said that he was alone
in his speculations and that his use of
the bank's money began about six
years ago. He said that about three
years ago. when the loss had reached
only $20,000, an auditing committee was
appointed to go over the bank's books.
Rose had hoped that his shortage
would be discovered then, but at the
end of a week or so of investigation
the committee reported everything sat
isfactory with the bank's affairs.
Rose declared that he lived within his
salary of $125 a month, and has not
got a cent of the money lost to the
bank by his speculation.- When the
shortage had reached $20,000, Rose said,
he knew that he would have to replace
that sum, and seeing no other way of
so doing than by speculating, he con
tinued to risk large sums until the
amount reached S187.000. His mental
state had been miserable ever since his
speculation began, he said, and often
he had been tempted to commit suicide,
but did not do so because of his wife
and family.
All. of the entire sum of $187,000, Rose
declares, was lost with grain specula
tion In Chicago. His willingness for a
speedy trial and imprisonment, he said,
vrja.s to relieve his mind of the worry
that he had undergone. He desired to
be sentenced and serve his term and
afterward to begin life anew.

Colonel Youughusband, commanding

ultimatum warning him to return to
Gnatong and promising that there
would be serious trobule if he did not
do so.
It is understood all wagers made in
each room were honestly recorded on
each sheet by the conspirators, but on
one sheet would be recorded wagers
that were not made. If the result of
the race showed the fraudulent wagera
to be successful the sheet on which
they were recorded was turned lnt<Â»
the central office of the syndicate. If
the result of the race showed the
fraudulent wagers to be losses, the
honest sheet was turned in. Thus the
dishonest employes stood no chance
of loss, and almost every day they
were able to take thousands of dollars
from their^ employer. In other cases
the results of races were held back by
operators until wagers on the winner
could be recorded.

. Thr clash between the Coroner and i
the police in the Blaise murder case has
' reacted a critical stage and this morn
jrrg It may produce trouble. The police
. claim ihf nslit to direct things and Cor
<-nr.;- LolanJ demands that they do not
interfere with the resumption of the
. inquest, which is ?et for 10 o'clock this
morning.
Judge Cab&nlss has ordered all wit
nesses in the case to appear in his court
af 10:00 this morning. Detective Gib^
Ron says the witnesses will be in court
" when wanted, despite the fact that
rabpenu were served on them yester
day by the Coroner's office, command
. ing them to appear at the inquest at
"thr same hour.
Coroner Iceland is willing to inter
change, witnesses with the Police Court
this morning, but he says that if the ,
police refuse to allow the witnesses to
come to the inquest he will exercise the
'power; of his office, which he believes
is' paramount over the courts.
The police have, conducted the case
*\'ith a high hand and have ignored the
Coroner. Dr. Leland has tried to ac
cede to their desires and he even of
fered to confer with them on the mat
ter of yetting a date for the inquest.
His overtures to this end met with re
buffs* and he was compelled last Tues
grtay raornTnjS to. besfn ...ttÂ» - inquest.
vTlich he had deferred for more than
.two wetkK, out of consideration for the
<Srtectivpj=.
Jast what will develop this morning
5f not known, but it is conceded that
the Coroner, by virtue of his higher
,tnd more powerful office, will probably
be victorious.
Yesterday's hearing in Judge Ca
baniss' court was marked by
a jumble of confused testimony by Jo
pr-ph Neiblas. Boeder's landlord. " His
testimony can be attributed largely to 1
his ignorance, but it seemed as if he
labored und^r other influences than an
unintelligent mind. He antagonized
every effort of the attorney for the de
fense and showed a peculiar faculty of
misunderstanding the Questions ofAt
torney Salomon, who at times aban
doned the witness as hopeless.
A STUBBORN WITNESS.
Xnblas mad" many admissions and
contradictions and showed a remarka
ble inability to understand the meaning
of the questions asked by the defense.
He was caught in contradictions sev
eral times and was so tangled that it is
doubtful whether Judge Cabaniss will
; give it much weight. Xeiblas seemed
impressed vith his own importance.
He wandered from things relevant and
told of his own great work in gathering
â¢evidence against Soeder. He was rep
rimanded by Judge Cabanjss, who re
ferred to him as a "garrulous witness,
'highly excited and ignorant." Judge
Oabaniss said he could net see the rel
evancy of a great part of the testimony
for the prosecution. The Statf, bow
ev*=>r, professed to be laying a founda
tion for stronger evidence.
. .The session was productive of a
number of disputes between the attor
reys. Judge Catania took a hand and
fi* and attorney Salomon had several
Varm discussions. Salomon objected
, to much of the testimony. The Judge
admitted the testimony because the
, hearing was preliminary, though he
stated that should thrÂ» State fail to
Fhow relevancy he would not consider
; UM testimony in the reaching of his
decision.
â¢ The hearing consumed the entire day.
Mrs. Neiblas. the first witness
examined yesterday, contradicted her
â¢testimony of Wednesday, when she
pwore she did not know whether th^re
r.as a light in Soeder"s room on the
â¢right of the murder. Yesterday she
said there v as no light in the room, fur
â¢ h*>r husband had got down on his knees
â¢ b*fore the door that led from their
room to Soedcr's and had noticed that
ihere ivas no light. Her husband veri
fied the statement. On cross-examina
t:<m Mrs. Neiblas was forced to admit
ihot oftÂ»n there had been no Jitjht in
th" room at that hour of the night.
/ Mrs. Nfiblas told of the visit of tho
'."insurance detective to her house in his
attempt to find out something about
S&eder and Blaise, who had applied in
â¢ ihe Aetna company for insurance. She
s-aid that Soedcr had told her that
â¢ Blaise was taking out an insurance
policy in favor of his wife and children.
Mrs. Neiblas was unable to identify the
gray suit of Boeder's that the police
allege he wore on the night of the mur
der, but thought it looked like the one
he had v.oin <>n thr- day he rented the
mum. She said that Seeder, at 2
D"dodc on the Monday that the body of
Blaise- was discovered, took Blaise's
dollies from the wardrobe In the fold
ing bed and extruded from them pome
large envelopr-s that sh<-> thought con
tained the insurance policies.

Under cross-examination she ad-
c mitted that she had seen Soeder wear
the gray suit but once, the day that

TOKIO, Jan. 28.â It is expected that
the answer of Russia to Japan's latest
note will reach Tokio : not later than
next Monday. \
Russia's response is eagerly awaited,
and should it prove unsatisfactory to
Japan an immediate declaration of war
seems unavoidable. The Japanese feel
that the entire : responsibility for the
outcome rests with Russia.
Some doubt is expressed that Russia
appreciates the determination and tem
per of the Japanese people, but it seerna
incredible that Baron de Rosen has
failed to correctly inform the Govern
ment In St. Petersburg of trie situation.

PARIS. Jan. 29. â The Port Arthur
correspondent of the Paris edition of

departure of the Ninth, Tenth . and
Eleventh Siberian Rifles for the Yalu

Vice Admiral Alexieff is suffering with
influenza, but confers daily with his

The authorities have invited Rus

The reorganization of Port Arthur's

Korea and China. .
PORT ARTHUR, Jan. 29. â A tele
gram reported to have been sent by
the Russian military attache, at Tokio
was received yesterday. It gave in
formation of the mobilization of the
Japanese army and had the effect of
renewing preparations for the dis
patch of troops already ordered to the
north, but which had been detained
on account of the peaceful aspect of

SEOUL, Jan. 28.â The internal dis
turbance is spreading. It is the re

ernors of three provinces report* that
their officers have been captured by
organized bands and Government
funds taken.
I am unable to obtain cable com
munication with Vladivostok, but am
informed by passengers who have ar
riven at Gensan from Vladivostok and
from other sources that the disturb
ance there on the 9th inst., the Rus
sian-Christmas, was created by intoxi
cated Russian marines and Japanese
women. Numerous houses were de
stroyed, mostly Japanese, and the
Russian theater. The usual fighting
occurred. As occurs on such occa
sions there was considerable brutality,
but no fatalities. No earnest efforts
were made by the officers to control
the marines until much property was
destroyed.
The notification of Korean neutral
ity cabled from Chefu to the powess
was unknown in the Korean Foreign
Office until replies were received from
Korean representatives abroad. The
intimation was that it was arranged
by Ti Yong Ik and Hyen SanK Kun,
the latter having just returned from
Russia. .
The Korean Minister in Tokio was
instructed to-day to especially urge
Japanese's immediate recognition of
Korea's neutrality.

KOREAN RIOTS SPREADING.
"One explorer followed mysterious
footprints in the snow of the high
mountains of New Zealand, but never
came up with the beast that had made
them. But they were such strange foot
prints that other scientists agreed with
him that the thing that made them was
quite unknown to the world and must
be a wonderful being.
"So. you see. there Is plenty of work
still for us wild animal catchers. We
haven't seen everything that there is to
be seen by a long shot." â London Ex
press. â¢ .
"He says that he has heard so many
tales from the native hunters up there
of the existence of a one-horned ante
lope horse that he Is bound to try and
get one. I don't think there is any such
thing myself, but then I didn't take
much stock In the discovery of a primi
tive wild horse In Central Asia, either,
and now the zoological gardens of
Hamburg and New York have living
specimens of these horsesâ funny, big
headed little brutes that are repre
sentatives of some type of horse that
must be hundreds of thousands of
years old.
"Down in New Zealand, comparative
ly small as the land is, there are many
animal and bird mysteries still. They
say that there is a brand-newâ that is,
new to the world â type of animal on
the order of the duckbill down there
yet. Darwin always thought that some
day a veritable lizard bird (not a flying
bird, but a true missing link between
the birds and the reptiles) might be
fcund there.
. "It is a true rodent like the rat, but
it \s as big as a Newfoundland dog.
T/nat would be a good catch for a zo
ological garden.
"Another fine- prize is down there in
South America. It is a new species of
jaguar, auite different from any that
has ever been exhibited In the shows
in any part of the world. It's a big.
black fellow and tremendously fierce.
Nobody has ever taken. one alive.
"Then in the forests of the Amazon
are two birds that would make their
captor, a famous man among zoologists.
They are the bell bird, which has a
voice exactly like a clear ringing bell,
and the 'lost soul,' which has a cry that
makes the shivers creep along a man's
backbone when he hears it in those
dark, mysterious, silent, forbidding
woods.
"In Burmah somewhere is a rhinoce
ros that has a black hide and big tuft
ed ears. The hide has been seen by
white men lots of times, but they
haven't ever seen a living animal.
"Up in the Himalayas a man has
been looking for years forâ what do
you suppose? A unicorn. He may be
crazy â he may be right.
LOOKING FOIt A UXICORN".
"Down in South Africa, somewhere
behind the northeastern side of the
Andes, a little north of the equator.
Is a beast that is the biggest rodent
in the world. Travelers have seen
pieces of Its hide and its bones, and a
few have glimpsed it as it sped through
the dark primeval forests.
RAT AS BIG AS A DOG.
"It's a cross , between a draff e and
a horse, apparently, and a mighty bis
animal. There'll be big money fqr the
circus that' gets the first specimen, and
there are some plucky and smart men
in Uganda at this very moment look
ins for the brute. â¢
"Nobody has been lucky enough or
smart enough to catch a Kadiak bear
alive and carry hlfh to civilization.
There's something like a beast for you
â big as a calf, so that he'd make a
roaring Rocky Mountain griisly look
like a little brown bear alongside at
him.
"Oh, there are a good "many animals
that are still to be caught and exhib
ited in the menageries." said the old
animal man, reaching 1 Into'the : cage and
scratching the head of a jaguar. "I
can run off quite a list without; stop
ping to think.
"All the ' zoos are eager now for an
okapi. That's the strange prehistoric
beast that Sir Harry. Johnston 'found

. Van Loon at last tumbled to the fact
that he was 'the victim of an unscru
pulous gang of bunko men and reported
the matter to Captain Martin. The de
.tectives were put upon the case and
the arrest followed. All of the bets
made were placed in a supposed pool
room at the corner of O'Farrell and
Powell streets. Van Loon states that
he put his money in the hands of some
fellow who made an entry in a book,
but did not give a voucher and that
Pincus and his partners did likewise.
The. fiolice are now searching for this
man, as there is little doubt that he
was one of the gang. The arrest took
place in a room at the corner of Geary
and Powell streets, rented by Van
Loon. A telephone had been Installed
so that he could make inquiries about
th*Â» horses without any of the trio com
ine to the hotel.
Cox claims to be an owner of several
race horses. Williams maintains that
Barney Schreiber couldD't get along
without him and Pincus Is known to
the police of this city and Seattle.
Unsuspicious of being fleeced when,
on January 21. Pincus imparted the In
formation that he had a sure winner,
Van Loon readily agreed to put up
$1300. Silurian was the "hot thing"
that was scheduled to run away from
the field, but for some reason did not
come within the money.
I " ; DISCO VEHV TOO LATE.
Several days later Van Loon was told
that Henry Ach would be a cinch and
accordingly pave Watson $600 to bet
and placed $700 himself. The horse ran
second and Van Loon was out $1300.
About/ this time Meyers, who seemed
to have made an Impression on -the
proprietor of the hostelry, borrowed
$250.
Pincus called on Van Loon on Jan
uary 12 and gave him $80 as his.win
nings on the race. He also imparted
the information to allay all suspicions
that they were going to make another
bet, which would be a losing one, and
Van Loon gave up $75 as' his share.
Pincus then made a proposition to
place $500 on a horse If the hotel man
would bet $1500. The money was to be
placed with a poolroom near the Cali
fornia Hotel, but Van Loon objected,
and Pincus did not press him. On the
following day Van Loon, upon the rep
resentations of Pincus, bet $250 and
lost.
About January 11 Pincus approached
Van Loon at the hotel relative to fur
nishing him with a quantity of pota
toes. During the conversation Pincus
incidentally mentioned that he had a
friend employed as an operator in the
Western Union Telegraph Company,
who was financially embarrassed and
was desirous of finding some one to
play the number of sure things that
were wired East. Van Loon thought
favorably of the proposition and an
appointment was made for the fallow
ing day. * v
Pincus met Van Loon and took him
to the office of the Western Union Tele
graph Company at the corner of Pine
and Montgomery streets. They started
to go upstairs, when Cox, the pseudo
telegrapher, who was masquerading
under the name of Meyers, made his
appearance. He warned Pincus not to
visit him in the building, as it would
cause his employers to become sus
picious. At this juncture Williams
made his appearauce, and was Intro
duced as Barney Schreiber's right-hand
man. It was decided to bet on a race
the following day and Van Loon gave
Pincus $20.
FTKST BET WINS.
With the arrest last evening of
George W* Williams, alias Watson,
Dave Â¦ Cox, alias Meyers, and Ben
Pincus, by Detectives Ryan, Taylor and
Coleman, a story has come to light of
the victimization 'of P. Van Loon, pro
prietor of the Franklin Hotel, out of
$3100. Van Loon saw visions of great
wealth by playing the races from in
side information furnished by the ( trio
and is now a sadder but wiser man.

published this morning to 'show that

The nature of the conclusions reached
by the council is carefully guarded, but
semi-official assurances were given that
the subject was considered in a pacific
spirit and with a determination to do
all possible to preserve peace and to
successfully terminate the negotiations!.
A special meeting of the Council of
State, under v the presidency of the

.Joseph NeiV.as was next placed r>n
the stand. Ke told of the various con
vecstttions that Soeder had with him
on the subject of insurance. His testi
inony was: in part as follows:
'One day Solder came to me and
said that it was a shame that a poc.
rnan could not insure a hnuse for much
money. He .Â«aid it v.as a sha:ne that
a .person could not insun* the same
thing in mure than one company. He
then asked me if I had my house in
jured, and told me that he had a house
injured in the country once and could
â¢only set 51500 on it. He said a. cor
l^oVation could insure in several com
panies, but a poor man had not the
privilege.
â¢ â¢â¢'Socder also told me that should any
one call arkir.? about his character leil
hini that he was a sober man and a
Â¦i r-spe>ctable citizen. He referred to in
surance people. I told him that I would.

had given Miss Flatley. He said Soeder

t'latley house on Marshall street and
Jsirl that he had found that his trur;k
had r*Â»en broken into and some things

front door of the house, as she had pr-^- j

v.as taken up in getting her to ex- |
TÂ»!a.in about the footprints in the gar
den, but she seemed to know little about
them. <-,*.*Â¦:'Â¦
She told of the proposition that.
Soeder made to Cannon to follow
Miss Flatley. and try to regain the
jewelry, and also of his offer of $10
to Cannon to burn down the young 1 j
woman's house. Miss King stated that i
Soeder also asked her if she would*;
burn the house down for $10.
"At 10 o'clock, or a few minutes be
fore." said the King: woman, on the
night of January 10, Soeder came
into the saloon and stood for a mo
ment under the archway | that leads
from the saloon to the dance hall. I
bowed to him and he returned the
bow. Then he left the place. That
was the last I saw of him." Miss King
said that s=he knew the time because
she looked at the clock a few min- i
utes after Soeder had left the saloon,
as she was anxious to set home, not
feeling well. It was then Just 10 1
o'clock.
The woman said she had seen Soe- !
der have a revolver several times, and j
that once he had pressed it to her
stomach. It was not loaded, but Soe
der carried the cartridges in his vest
pocket.
Frank Cannon took the stand and re- ]
hearsed the conversation between Soe-J
der and himself.* He says that he and
Soeder were drunk when Soeder made
the proposition to him. His testimony '<
was productive of nothing that has not
already been published.
Manuel A. Levy, the pawnbroker of;
2375 Bush street, to whom Soeder sold his
revolver and cartridges on the morn
ing of the discovery of the murder, 'Â¦
identified the receipt and Identified Soe- '
der as the man who signed the name;
of Sam Norm.Tn to it. Levy was un
able to identify the pistol on account:
of its being a common looking one.. j
Attorney Salomon objected to the in
troduction of. the pistol and cartridges I
as evidence, but was overruled.
Dr. Louis Bacigalupi, autopsy surgeon,'. 1
testified that death in the case of Blaise
resulted from a deep incised wound of i
the right side of the neck. The jugular i
vein and the carotid artery were sev- !
ered, causing the loss of a large amount
of blood. Bacigalupi said that death i
from such a wound as was found in'
Blaise's neck would result within fif- '
teen minutes. He said there were no!
broken bones or contusions on the body:
other than the wounds found on the!
scalp and neck, and two minor. contu
sions, one directly in back of the pinna
of the right ear. and one on the;point
of the right elbow.

Teresa Kins', the woman from the
O K saloon dance hall, 517 Pacific
street, testilied that she had met Soe
der the latter part of November last,
after the 16th, on which day she ar
rived from Los Angeles. Soeder did
not arrive In the city, with Blaise un
til December ] 2. when he registered
at tho United States Hotel.
The King woman said she intro
duced Frank Cannon to Soeder, on his
request for some one to do a little de
tective work. This introduction, she
said, was made on the 4th or 5th of
January- She said she had drank five
or six times with Soeder and only onca
did he have Blaise with him. She
identified Blaise by his photograph.
The day that Blaise visited the saloon
with Soeder she said was the 17th or
'18th of December.
der had a black suit on the night he
was at the restaurant. Henley asked
the woman whether she had talked to
Attorney Campbell, one of Soeder's
attorneys, during- the noon recess. She
denied that she had. Gibson alleges
that she was seen in conversation with
Campbell. .
Her sister, Clothilde Vallarta, cor
roborated the testimony and was
asked if she had been approached by
the attorney for the defense. She
said no. The testimony given by her
and her sister was a point for the de
fense, as the police have been trying
to prdVe that Soeder wore a gray suit
when he was in the restaurant with
Blaise.
She told of Soeder's visit . to her
place, the day after the murder and
said that he told her that Blaise was
killed and that he had $90 on his per
son when Soeder last saw him.
Detective Gibson wanted to Im
peach the witness, but Prosecuting
Attorney. Hen ley ;. thought It better .. to
let her. go. Gibson says the woman
has been approached by friends' of
Boeder's and told to swear that Soe-

that he saw him almost every day.
WO.MAX REPEATS TESTIMONY.
Maria Vallarta. who with her sister
conducts the Original Mexican restau
rant at 721 Broadway, restaurant
where Blaise, in company with Soeder,
took his last meal, was placed on the
stand. Her testimony was the same a3
that given by her at the Cc-roner's in
quest on Tuesday. She maintains that
it was 5:30 when the two men came to
supper and 6 or 6:00 o'clock when they
left the restaurant. She said she
thought that Soeder had a black suit
on at the time he was in -her restau
rant and was sure that it was a dark
one.
Neiblas identified a pair of shoes as
the ones he had tried in the tracks in
the garden beneath Boeder's window.
He did not know whether the shoes be
longed to Soeder. He identified a com
mon, nickel-plated revolver as the one
he had seen in Soeder's overcoat pocket
prior to the murder. His identifica
tion v.as made by a speck e-f rust on
the butt end of the metal handle.
When Attorney Salomon was trying
to elicit an intelligent answer in re
gard to the tracks in the garden, Nei
b'as Kc-t angry at being asked to repeat
his answer. Attorney Salomon Insisted
on asking him the question three times,
and was cut short by Judge Cabaniss.
Salomon insisted in asking his ques
tion, and (he Judge told the witness
not to answer. Salomon took excep
tion to the rulinjr.
The gray suit worn by Soeder on the
night c-f the murder, as alleged by the
police, was produced, and Neiblas. al
thougn he had ser-n it but once, and
that more than six wee,ks ago, identi
fied it as that worn by Soeder on the
day he rented the room. The suit was
of an ordinary pattern, such as may
be seen every day. yet Neiblas was
positive it was Boeder's. He told of a
transom over the door of his room
leading from the hall, and said that
every time the front door or the door
leading from the hall into Boeder's
rooru was opened he would be able to
detect It by the shaking of the tran
som over his door. 'â¢The whole house
shakes," said Neiblas, "whenever a
door is opened or any one walks on
the floors. The folding bed also makes
a lot of noise, as It has to be turned
around before it can be opened."
At this stage Neiblas became excited
and insisted on bringing his wife Into
the testimony, and seemed hurt when
he was toJd to relate only what he
himself knew. Judge Cabaniss inter
ceded and said that the witness should
be shown consideration because he was
a high-strur.g individual, who could
neither read r.or write.
COAT IN" COURT.
This statement, coming from a wit
ness who the previous day was not
positive of anything, created general
surprise.
swore that he knew that Soeder was
not in his room on the night in ques
tion. When asked his reasons he said
that he had looked under the door and
had seen no light in the room. He had
previously stated that he would not
have heard Soeder con:r in had he en
tered the house after 10:13 on the night
of the murder. Yesterday he was posi
tive that Soeder could not have come
home after 10:15 o'clock. His reasons
for this absolute statement were that
he had always heard the front door
ipen whether he was asleep or awake:.
3o he argued Soeder could not have
ome in the front door, lighted a lamp
.1 his room or let down the folding bo-1
â¢;â¢ he would have, heard him.' â¢ * Â¦_*

HAVANA, Jan. 28.â The official ac
counts of the rioting at Cienfuegos
given out at the palace here minimize
the occurrence. The Mayor of Cien
fuegos has telegraphed that the trouble
was promotetd by detectives dressed in
citizens* clothes, and a telegram has
been received from the Governor of the
province saying that Colonel Campillo
of Santa Clara was stabbed three
times. The, reports issued by the Gov
ernment ate meager, but they relate
that some men styling themseives po
lice agents ejected several Liberals
who were copying the lists of voters
from the City Hall. These Liberals are
reported to have torn down and de
stroyed other election lists. The offi
cial reports also say that one Liberal
leader was so badly clubbed at the rail
road station that he had to be taken to
the hospital.
The trouble began In the Central
Cafe when Francisco Canellos and Vic
tor Zegreran, Republicans, who were
entertaining some Colombian friends,
were attacked by several Liberal Na
tionalists. The cafe was transformed
into a battlefield, and a large and ex
cited crowd surged back and forth In
the streets.
The principal fight occurred in front
of the City Hall. Many revolver shots
were tired, but nobody was shot, the
injuries all resulting from stick and fist
encounters. The people of the city were
alarmed and barred their doors and
Â¦windows and closed all the stores. The
situation is calmer to-day, but politi
cal feeling runs high.

the case.
Other letters of a similar nature
have been received and pronounced
hoaxes by the police. At present the
police say that they have no tangible

WASHINGTON. Jan. :3.â General
Sanchez, whom the Morales Govern
ment has appointed Dominican Minister
to the United States, had a long talk
with acting Secretary Loomis to-day.
The* substance of what the Minister
had to say was that his Government
was prepared to execute all demands
of this country regarding pending
claims and to stand by all agreements
this Government had made with pre
vious Dominican administrations. Min
ister Powell has practically recognized
the Morales Government and no effort
will be made to recall this action unless
the Morales forces demonstrate their
inability to maintain order. It is said
that Minister Sanchez desires to raise
funds here to put the Government on
a firm basis. No date for his recep

nite character regarding his status
has been decided upon.
Word has been received from General

Success in Eastern Cities of
System to l)c Introduced Here
Â»
The Board of Education and the
j Board of Health held a conference yes
1 terday to discuss the best methods of
insuring the sanitary condition of tlie
public schools. Dr. James TV. Ward,
president of the Health Board, read a
carefully prepared paper, in which he
advocated a systematic medical exam
â¢ iration of pupils in order that their
| health might be preserved. Ward held
j that attention to the physical condition
i of children was quite as important as
i their mental education. He said that
! medical inspection in the Chicago
] schools had very sensibly reduced the
I mortality from diphtheria and other
diseases.
"Nervous diseases afe especially com
! mon among school children." said Dr.
j Ward, "and impair their capacity for
I acquiring knowledge. This condition
I could be improved by daily or periodi
i cal medical inspection, such as prevails
; in. Boston and New York, Philadelphia
and other cities. The objects to be
attained include not only the general
I improvement of the sanitary condition
of schools, but the detection of diseases
among the pupils. These diseases may
be transmitted through the contact of
wraps or even the use of pencils.

to have our volunteer staff of physi
cians make daily visits to the schools
I in the morning and pass upon the con
j dition of the pupils from a medical
point of view. The inspection could be
extended so as to include examinations
ol the eves and ears of the scholar."
President Roncovieri assured the
Health Board of the hearty co-opera
tion of the School Board, which had
already pursued some investigations as
to the physical condition of the pupils,
especially with regard to the eye anil
the ear, under the supervision of Su
j perintendent of Schools Langdon.
j "As to the method to be followed,"
; said Roncovieri, "we should discuss
; that further. AVe do not desire to in
j fringe on the rights of parents, as they
' might resent it. I notie*e in Dr. Ward's
i address that the medical inspectors
j should in no way interfere with the
j family physician, which i$ a good feat
i ure of the plan."
TENDS TO PATERNALISM.
Superintendent Langdon expressed
| the fear that the proposed plan was
I lending too far toward paternalism.
I Longdyn advised that action in the
I premises be slow, so as to make the
| plan as fn>e from objection as possi-
I ble. .Teachers would object if it inter
! fered with their school work, Langdon
' said.
"I would like to see how our present
; plan of having: cards filled out by
! teachers regarding the health condi
| tion of pupils works out." said Lang
| don.
"If we know that an evil exists," said
Mayor Schmitz. who attended the con
ference, "why not. meet it boldly and
correct the evil? The plan will meet
with objections, as any plan will. The
recommendations made in Dr. Ward's
address may be looked upon as being
too radical, but it will be wise to carry
them out gradually, as Dr. % Ward has
outlined. I desire to see harmony in
all the boards, so that the best re
sults may be attained for the com
munity, whose servants we are."
Director Mark thought Dr. Ward's
recommendations did not go too far
and Dr. Poheim, member of the Health
Board, said the plan could be carried
out in a delicate way so that no ex
ception could be taken to it.
Roncovieri said there were eighty
two schools, which would require an
equal number of inspecting physicians.
The boards will hold another confer
ence to decide on ways and means to
put the plan in force.

* Tood I an n Is Worthless I'nless t)i-
gested â Some Stomachs Must
Have Help.
f Food taken into the Stomach which.
u from the nature of the rood or the con-
dition of the stomach, is not digested,
if wonse than no food at all. This is a
true statement as far as it goes and a
great many dyspeptics go only this far
with their reasoning. They argue with
'themselves that because their stomachs?
do not do the work given them, they
must be given less work: in other words
they must be starved. It would be just
as sensible for a business man who ia
ur.ab!Â«Â» to do all his own work to cut
down his business to his own rapacity
a? it is for a man to starve himse!f lo
relice his stomach. The sensible busi-
ness man employs help and goes for-
ward with his business. Likewise the
1 sensible dyspeptic will employ help for
his stomach and give his body proper
â¢nourishment.
Stuart's Dysp^jsia Tablets actually
do the work assigned to thorn. They re-
iieve weak and overburdened stomach.s
* of a great portion of digestive' action.
Their component parts are identical
with those of the digestive fluids and
secretions of the stomach and they sim-
oly take ud the grind and carry on
the work Just the same as a good,
strong. hÂ»althy stomath would do it.
e On this .account Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are perfectly natural in their
â¢ action and effects. They do not cause !
any! unnatural or violent disturbance,
in the stomach or bowels. They them-
selves digest the food and supply the
sjstem with all the nourishment con--
m tained in what is eaten and carry out
nature's plans for the sustenance and
maintenance of the body.
How much more sensible <s this
method than that employed by many :
sufferers from weal: stomach. By this i
means the body ar.d brain get all the
good, nutritious food they need and lh<i
â¢ man is properly nourished and equipped
to carry on his work and perform his \
duties. He could not possibly be in '
proper working condition by starving \
himself or employing some new fans" |
*od, insufficient food that does not con- i
tain enough nutriment for a year-old
baby. A. strong man doing strong work ;
must be properly fed and this applies
U> the brain as well as the body.
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets, by "re- '
l.icving the stomach of its v/ork, enable !
it to recuperate and regain its normal ,
health and strength. Nature repairs
the worn and wasted tissues Just as she
heals and knits tho bone of a broken !

of insanity sufficient to have him un
dergo an examination.
then he shall perform the duties of the
warden in his stead.
The Custodianâ The custodian shall
receive and take Charge of all moneys
and other articles of value belonging
to persons entering the hospital as pa
tients. He shall execute and deliver
to the patient, or his or her accredited
representative, a detailed receipt; he
shall cause to be kept a record of all
such property, so received by him in
a book provided for that purpose, in
which he shall make entries of the re
ceipt and description of all-such prop
erty a proper memorandum of its re
turn or disposal. It shall be the duty
of such custodian to turn over all such
property to the owner .or duly author
ized agent of such owner on Ins or her
discharge from the^ hospital, and in
cases of death of the owner he shall
turn over such property to the owner a
relative or the legal representative of
such deceased patient, or to any per
son who has been properly designated
by him for that purpose. In cases
however, where an inquest is held by
the Coroner the custodian shall turn
over to the Coroner such property be
longing to the deceased^patient as shall
be demanded by the Coroner, at the
same time taking his receipt therefor.
The custodian shall cause all the goods

labeled and indexed The custodian
Â«vini eive to the warden a good and
sufficient bond in the sum of $2500 for
the fakhffll performance of his duty.
The duties until further orders of the
Board lot Health shall be performed by
the assistant warden.
There is nothing in the particular
duties outlined under the heading
-Custodian," which is not clerical in
its nature and which cannot be per
formed by an experienced clerk for
the Department of Health. Nor ta
tw'p anything in the statement that
Se assistant warden shall assist the
warden in the performance Â°* his ex
ecutive duties and in the manage
ment of the hospital, which precludes
the appointment of an experienced
clerk to the position. As a matter of
fact, the testimony in this case shows
that one of the protestants herein .did
assist in the management of the hos
nital bv exercising supervision over
the food .department and by inspect-
Ine the various wards of the institu
tion This same protestant also acted
fi~ custodian nnd received and receipt
ed for valuables in much the same
manner as Is now prescribed by the
Board of Health. The rules provide
that "in case of the absence or inabil
itv of the warden to act, then he (the
assistant warden) shall perform the
duties of thc warden in his stead."
That is to say, that if the warden Is
not able to attend, to his. duties,
through sickness or absence, his as
sistant shall continue to perform
what Â¦ he' may have done theretofore
and also assume some larger degree of
responsibility temporarily. The tes
timony shows thnt in the same degree
larger responsibilities were heretofore
imposed upon the experienced clerk
at the hospital, during the absence of
the head of the institution.
1 David Wolfe testified that 1n 1902.
when he was a- civil service clerk at
the hospital, executive duties were as
signed to him. He was then called
the secretary of the hospital (a mere
courtesy title) and he acted as the
assistant to the resident physician,
then the head of the institution. Dur
ing the absence of the resident phy
sician it was this clerk's dutj' to see
that the rules of the hospital were ob-
served and he performed executive
duties in that respect. It appears,
therefore, that, as a matter of fact,
the very same duties now imposed
upon the asistant warden were exer
cised In the same institution by an
experienced clerk who has been dis
missed.
The very title of the new position
shows that the appointee was to hi
considered merely, as an w assistant to
the warden. He is not termed a deputy
warden, but assistant warden. He is
simply an assistant to the warden. Ad
mitting, for' the sake of argument, that
he is a 'deputy, it is not required that
he shall possess the same qualifications
as the warden. The charter requires,
for instance, that the City Attorney
must have been qualified to practice
law for at least ten years; but his as
sistants, who are as much his deputies
as the assistant warden is the warden's
deputy, are not required to possess the
same qualification: An experienced
clerk, therefore, could properly fill the
position, even if it were a deputy's
position.
It is the opinion of this commission
that rule 20 should be applied In fillin.ic
the position of assistant warden. It
further appears that this position
should be filled by certification from
the list of experienced clerks, Depart
ment of Health, and it is the judgment
of this commission that the Board of
Health shall forthwith make requisition
for such', certification, as required by
section 9, Article XIII, of the charter.'
It being determined, therefore, that a
regular appointment to this position
can be made from an eligible list, the
temporary appointment of James P.
McQuaide as assistant warden and cus
todian is hereby disapproved.
EXPERIENCED CLERKS.
Edward MY Coffey, David Wolfe, J.
W. Cameron and Frank J. Stanton, the
protestants herein, and Mrs. Mary Tur
ner, . Mrs. R. E. Shelton and Percy R.
Hennessy, the clerks retained by the;
Board of Health, were all appointed
from, the eligible list of experienced
clerks, Department of Health, at the
meeting of the Board of Health held
October 1, 1900. By its resolution of
January 9 the. Board of Health vacated
the positions of assistant secretary,
held by Cameron; statistician, filled by
Coffey: a clerkship in the main office,
filled by Stanton, and' a clerkship in
the County Hospital, filled by Wolfe.
The four, clerks dismissed under this
resolution 'were the protestants herein.
The clerks retained were Mrs. Turner,
Mrs. Shelton and Percy R. Hennessy.
Section " of rule 24 of this commission
provides as follows:
"Whenever, for lack of work or lack
of funds, or for purposes of retrench
ment, it becomes necessary to reduce
the number of permanent employes in
a' certain class, the employe last ap
pointed in that cjass shall be laid off
first. - He shall be reinstated upon the
eligible list in his original position and
shall be preferred for certification In
response to the next requisition for ap
plicants from that list."-
The purpose of this rule was to give
preference for retention in office to the
employe senior in service. It is ap
parent from the argument made by the
attorney for the Board of Health that
in reducing its staff of experienced
clerks and in selecting for retention the
three clerks who were retained ' the
Board of Health believed it was acting
in accordance both with the spirit and
thc letter of the, section .of the rule
quoted. As a matter of fact, all the
clerks, were appointed upon the same
day and at thc same meeting
of the Board of Health. In. dis-
criminating among clerks and In se
lecting for dismissal those whom it
thought were least efficient, compara
tively, the Board of Health acted upon
the common law rule that there are no
fractions of a day. Ordinarily this rule
would apply, but in this particular in
stance its application is prevented by
the charter limitation, which provides
that in making appointments each place
of employment shall be filled separate
ly. (Section 10, article XIII, Charter.)
The determination of the seniority of
officers appointed upon the same day
is fixed by the actual time of their ap
pointment. Although clerks are â¢ not
officers, the same rule will apply in
their cases. Coffey was appointed from
the first certification made. As his ap
pointment must have been complete
before any appointment could have
been made from the next certification,
it logically follows that the clerk ap
pointed from the last certification must
have been the last man appointed.
In applying the rule to the dismissals
effected by the Board of Health in the
Instances of the experienced clerks it
will be necessary therefore to lay off
the clerks in the inverse order of their
appointment. Hennessy's appointment
being subsequent to Coffey's the former
should havff been laid off and the lat
ter retained. It is,- therefore, the de
cision of this commission that Hen
nessy be dismissed and Coffey rein
stated.
DAIRY IXSPECTOR.
Subsequent to the filing of the pro
tests made by the protestants men
tioned in the title of this proceeding
an additional protest was filed by E.
C. Smith, Dairy Inspector, against his
removal by the Board of Health and
the appointment in his place of E. B.
O'Connor, another Dairy Inspector.
This cause of protest having arisen
about the same time as the others, it
will be considered herein.
Reference to the records of this of
fice in connection with the appoint
ment of Dairy Inspectors Smith and
O'Connor, and the subsequent dis
missal of O'Connor, followed by his re
instatement, and the dismissal of
Smith, shows clearly that in this mat
ter the Board of Health acted in viola
tion of Article XIII of the charter. This
fact being called to its attention in a
letter from this commission under date
of January, 19, 1904, | the Board of
Health, at a special meeting held on
January 21. 1904. reinstated Smith and
dismissed O'Conrlor.
The protests of O. S. Mish. D. Rear
don v and J. F. Derham, Food Inspect
ors, are sustained. These men have
been returned to duty by the Board of
Health, in compliance with the direc
tions of this commission, as set forth
in a letter under date of January 14
1904.
.W. J. B. Mackay has filed with this
commission a communication under
date of January 21. 1904, in which he
states that he has no protest to make
against the action of. the Board of
Health in laying him off. because, in
his opinion, it had the right to reduce
its staff of food inspectors if it so de
sired, and because, further, as he was
one of the last two men appointed,
and as the last two men were laid off,
in his opinion this action was In com
pliance with the rules of the Civil Ser
vice Commission. Mr. Mackay there
fore withdrew his protest.
Samuel J. Campbell was appointed
Market Inspector October 9, 1902. On
December 31. 1903, W. H. Lamb was ap
pointed Market Inspector. At its meet
ing on January 9. 1904, the Board of
Health, by resolution, vacated the po-
sitlons of two market Inspectors in the
interests of economy. In accord
ance with this resolution Campbell and
Lamb were dismissed, and their names
have been returned to the eligible list.
as required by rule 24 of this commis
sion.
The right of the Board of Health to
reduce its staff of employes is express
ly recognized by section -' of rule 24. It
is therefore held that in vacating the
positions of the two market inspectors
the Board of Health acted within its
rights. As Campbell and Lamb were
the last two appointees and as they
were the men laid off. this action Is in
accordance with the spirit and the let
ter of section 2 of rule 2t. It does not
appear that Mr. Campbell has good
grounds for ccmplalnt. His protest
therefore is dismissed. Mr. Lamb Tiled
no protest.
FIXAfi FIXDIXGS.
The findings of the commission in this
investigation show that the protested
action of the Board of Health lg sus
tained in the following instances:
Abolition of the places of secretary
and six sanitary Inspectors and the dis
missal of two market inspectors and
two clerks: creation of the place of dep
uty health officer and four inspecting
physicians.
. In the following instances the action
of the Board of Health is overrruled
and disapproved:
Temporary non-civil service appoint
ment to the position of assistant
warden and custodian. City and County
Hospital; dismissal of two clerks, one
dairy inspector and three food inspect,
ors contrary to the rules; creation of
two new positions as milk inspectors.
These conclusions have been reached
after mature deliberation, following a
most thorough review of the testimony
and all of the surrounding circum
stances and a close study of the law
applying to the case.
CIVIL. SERVICE COMMISSIONERS:
GEORGE H. BAHRS.
CHARLES J. WILLIAMS,
JOHN W. ROGERS.
President.
Board of Public Works. Thereupon the
commission, believing that It had not
only the right and the power, but also
that it was Its duty to inquire into the
necessity of any appointment in the
classified civil service of the city before
granting its approval thereto, disap
proved the temporary appointment of
the newly created male stenographer.
The City Attorney overruled the com
mission and held that the Board of
Public Works had an absolute right to
create the position. The commission
also referred the question to Mayor
Phelan. In a letter to President Freud,
under date of February 13, 1901, Mayor
Thelan said: "I doubt very seriously If
you can, in advance, inquire into or
pass upon the necessity of employ
ment."
The opinion rendered by this com
mission on January IS, 1904, upon the
right of the Board of Health to create
a new position has called forth adverse
criticism, but, as has been shown, it
has the Eupport of high authority.
After most mature consideration this
commission is convinced that the po
sition it has taken on this question is
legally sound. It follows, therefore,
that the positions of secretary, chief
plumbing inspector, chief sanitary in
spector and sanitary inspectors, having
been abolished by the Board of Health,
no longer exist; provided that it does
not appear that these same positions
have been continued under different
names, titles or designations, as con
tended by contestants herein, for the
purpose of evading the retention in of
fice of civil service appointees. That
is a question of fact and will be con
sidered in its proper order.
PLACES CREATED.
Under this heading the places created
are the following: One deputy health
officer, four inspecting physicians, one
assistant warden and custodian (City
and County Hospital), two milk in-
SDectors. The milk inspectors will be
referred to subsequently, under the
heading "Food Inspectors." With ref
erence to the other positions it is neces
sary to consider the point made by pr.i
testants through their attorney. Frank
lin K. Lane, to the following effect:
Accepting the view of the Civil Ser
vice Commission that when offices in
a department have once been classified
the head of such department still re
tains the power to abolish such offices
and create new ones without the con
sent of the Civil Service Commission,
the first point I would make is that the
Beard of Health did not create any ne\V
offices upon January 9, because It did
not fix and establish the duties of such
new offices either prior to or at the
time of creating the same.
Aside from the fact that Mr. Lane
has somewhat misconstrued our opin
ion, which held only that the Board
of Health has the power to create
"places of employment" (not offices),
we consider that the point he raises has
no application to the positions Involved,
inasmuch as they have not been created
by legislative enactment. We under
stand the law to be that no office can
be created by legislative act unless the
creating statute or ordinance defines
its duties. In creating places of em
ployment the Board of Health does not
exercise a legislative function. Its act
Is merely an administrative or an ex
ecutive act. It has no power of legis
lation. It may increase, or in any other
way alter, the duties of its employes at
any time. The point of protest pre
sented by Mr. Lane is, therefore, over
ruled.
As no examinations for the newly
created places have been held it is
necessary for the commission to con
sider whether. In filling these places,
rule 20 should apply. That rule is
as follows:
Rule 20. Duties Rather Than Vame
to Be Considered â In certifying: to
requisitions the duties of the position
to be filled, rather than the name by
which it is called, shall be considered,
and it shall be the duty of the com
mission to inquire into the require
ments of the position for which a
requisition has been made and to cer
tify from that list of eligibles which
shall, in its Judgment, nearest con
form to the requirements of the posi
tion to be filled.
Eligible lists are created from ex
aminations held as the charter re
quires (section 4, article XIII), "to
fairly test the relative capacity of the
persons examined to discharge the du
ties of the positions to which they seek
to be appointed." In applying rule 20
it Is the duty of the commission to cer
tify from the list of eligibles which
shall. In its Judgment, nearest con
form to the requirements of the posi
tion to be filled. It is apparent that
In seeking such an eligible list the
commission must bear in mind the
provisions of section 4 of article XIII
of the charter, which, requires that the
examinations shall be practical in
their character, and restricts their
scope to the duties of the position to
be filled. Inquiry now naturally fol
lows: "Has the commission eligible
lists from which any or all of these
positions may be filled, or which con
form so nearly to the requirements of
the new positions that the commission
would be justified In making certifica
tions from them to the new places?"
To answer this question it will be nec
essary to consider the new places. The
first to be considered will be ..
DEPUTY HEALTH OFFICER.
The duties of deputy health offi
cer are set forth as follows, on pages
402, Volume 11, "Minutes of the De

21, 1K04, which record was Introduced

The hearing of the cases of the men
who claimed to be illegally deprived of
ih^'.r positions has occupied the atten
tion of the board for several days and
a, mass of evidence was taken. The

public investigation.
At the meeting of the Civil Service
Commission on the evening of January
II, .1&04, it was decided to hold a public
. Investigation Jnto the actions of th.e
Board of Health In the matters herein
jtjst forth and to give consideration at
that time to the protests tiled, or which
?. icht thereafter be filed, and to in
q-jiire fully into the allegations that
the Board* of Health had violated the
rjiarjer provisions covering civil ser
"v<ce or the rules of the Civil Service
Commission.
Subsequent to the meeting of the
r""Tr.rnission Â°n the 11th inst., additional
â¢ <*>mmunicatinns were received from the
P-iarf Â¦ of Health, setting forth the
â¢ iÂ«.ines of the men affected by the reso
lutions adopted by that board on Jan
'iiry 9. 1904. and assigning as the cause
â¢ for tbj* abolitions and dismissals "re-
I nejjchment. economy and general bet

PLACES ABOLISHED.
i Investigation into the actions of the
Board of Health shows that the fol
jowing places of employment were abol
ished OH January 9, 1904: Secretary,
chief plumbing inspector, chief, sani
,iary Inspector and six sanitary inspec
â¢ i/>rs. The other positions mentioned in
ihe resolution, in which the protestants
' herein are concerned, were declared to
b~ abolished by the resolution, but as
Â¦ a matter of fact they were merely va
cated, and the incumbents were re
â¢ liÂ«ved from duty, so that the number
' , r 'f employs could be reduced in the
â¢ interests of economy. The right of the
Â¦ ".Hoard of Health to create and to abol
}<V\ positions has been defined by this
1 commission in an opinion rendered Jan
uary 13. 1904, part of which opinion is
h're quoted:
With respect to thÂ» Department of
"Public Health, however, no places of
"employment are created by the charter.
*Tlte pwrer to create places of employ
tfitet for this department is specifically
conferred upon the Board of Health by
h^ charter, perticn 5 of article X. That
ffriion is as folio wb:
*'T.he ; board may appo'.nt *uch offi
Â«-*>rs, atrents and employes as may h<* .
nff^ssan- for the proper and efficient
carrying out nnd enforcement of the
. p"rpo9cs and duties of the board, and
may fix their salaries and prescribe
tr.-ir duties."
There can be no question that the
sole and exclusive power and jurisdic
tion to create places of emnloyrnent In
the Department of Public Health is by
this provision of the charter conferred
lipon the Board of Health. That the
'udgment of the Board of Health is the
so]r> criterion for determining the kind
ar,1 number of places of employment
that Khali exist in the Department of
Public Health. There can also be no
doubt that the power conferred in
,- iU^os the right to abolish places once
rrpa'red and the right to create new
Tdaz-es net previously existing:, and that
â¢ Uxtae rights may be exercised freely ana
ur.-cstrainMly without consultation
\.ith any of the departments of the
< ;! v government.
The right to abolish old places and
',i>'rr^ato n*Â»w ones is specifically rec
'â¢esized by section 13 of article XIII of
. 'hÂ« charter in these words:
'When any place of employment Is
r^ated or abolished or the compensa
tor; 'attached thereto altered, the offi
i :t or board making such change shall
Immediately report in writing to the
â¢ ivil Service Commissioner*."
LANE IS QUOTED;
Ei this connection reference may be
made, also to th? supporting opinion of
<jity Attorney .Lane, on the same sub
ject, rendered April 13. isoi. found in
the Opinions of the City At
i <>i hey of San Francisco, JS99 to 1902."
page 481. The facts upon which Mr.
June's opinion at that time was predi
cated were as follows: The Board of
Public Works created an additional
position as male stenographer. The
< ivil Service Commission demanded an
Â«>flltfal record of the duties to be per
formed by this man. so that the com
mission might consider the advisability
*>f approving his temporary appolnt
; nVnt. ThfÂ» Board of Public Works rc
fured to give the Information demand
ed, .upon the pround that the commis
sion had no right to inquire Into the
necessity for any appointment in the,
applications for admission to any of
the Institutions under the jurisdiction
of the board in the absence of his
chief and shall issue certificates of ad
mission thereto respectively. He shall
keep the records of all food, milk,
market and factory inspectors. The
deputy health officer shall do and
perform in addition to the duties here
inbefore set forth all and any duties
heretofoi-e assigned to or performed
by the former secretary, assistant sec
retary, statistician and clerk of the
board, as well as the clerical duties
heretofore assigned to the food In
spector assigned to the central office,
and such other duties as from time to
time may be assigned him by the
Board of Health or the Health Officer.
The deputy health officer must be an
efficient stenographer and no person
shall be appointed to this office who is
not a competent stenographic repor
ter."
An examination of the duties- thus
defined shows that, to a great extent,
they are clerical. It is stated, however,
that it is essential that- the appointee
to this place shall be a competent
stenographer. The justification for re
quiring stenographic qualifications in
the deputy health officer is the desire,
as stated by the Board of Health, to
reduce expenses. Instead of a secre
tary and three clerks, -whose combined
salaries amount to 5550, the Board of
Health appoints a deputy health officer
with a monthly salary of $150. The
argument of the Board of Health that
this emplbye should possess steno
graphic qualifications in order that he
may readily perform the additional
duties imposed upon him is well taken.
The Board of Health says: "The dep
uty health officer must be an efficient
stenographer, and no person shall be
appointed to this office who is not a
competent stenographic reporter."
This statement is conclusive" as to the
qualifications for this position. This
commission has no power to fix the
duties, the qualifications or the com
pensation of appointees in the Board
of Health, nor to alter such duties,
qualifications or compensation when
once legally determined.
To such board has been given full
power to determine what clerks and
employes are necessary for the con
duct of the business of that depart
ment. They are responsible for the
conduct of this branch of the municipal
government. Within the limitations of
the charter as to the disposition of
their appropriation, they are absolute.
The Board,, of Public
Works has power to determine wheth
er a stenographer is necessary in the
office of the superintendent of build
ings. (The quotation is from the opin
ion of City Attorney Lane of April 19,
1901.)
â¢ We have an eligible list of applicants
for the position of secretary of the
Board of Health, .but the examination
for secretary did not inquire into the
relative capacity of the applicants to
perform stenographic work. In fact, as
stenographic work was not required of
the secretary, no part of the examina
tion for that position covered stenog
raphy. The same statement may be
made regarding the eligible list for ex
perienced clerk" for the Board of
Health. We have also lists of stenog
raphers, but these eligible applicants
were not examined upon clerical duties
of such a nature as is required in the
position of deputy health officer. There
is, therefore, no eligible list of appli
cants which so nearly conforms to the
duties of deputy health officer as to
justify this commission in applying
rule 20 to* the position under considera
tion.
This commission concludes, therefore,
that the position of deputy health offi
cer is a new place of employment, and
that it must be classified as such for
purposes of examination. Meanwhile
with the approval of this commission,
the position may be filled by a tempo
rary appointee. The temporary ap
pointment of Ix)uis Levy as deputy
health officer from January 9, 1904. to
and including January 31, 1904, is here
by approved.
INSPECTING PHYSICIANS.
The resolutions adopted by the Board
of Health on January 21, 1904, fixing: the
duties and qualifications of' various em
ployes, provide that the inspecting phy
cians must be physicians who have had
at least one year's medical practice in
San Francisco. Among the duties as
signed to the In-pecting physicians are
those formerly assigned to the sanitary
Inspectors, the protestants. The argu
ment is made that as the protestants
are physicians they are capable of per
forming: any work now given over to
the inspecting physicians. While that
may be true, it ' not clear that it has
any bearing at all upon the right of the
Board of Health to create the new posi
tions. Although credit was awarded
for "experience in medicine" In the ex
amination for sanitary inspector" the
examination was not restricted to phy
sicians. It was to the advantage of the
applicants who passed the examina
tions, and who were appointed from the
eligible lists, that they were physicians;
but it should be borne in mind that a
layman, without any knowledge of
medicine, could easily have passed the
first examination, and in the opinion of
Judge Slack he could also have passed
the second. Deducting the 20 per cent
allowed for medical experience the lay
man coulu have obtained 180 per cent
which would have been 5 per cent more
than the necessary minimum for eligi
bility. The fact that the successful ap
plicants were physicians simply shows
the possession by them of qualifications
not required by the examination.
Section 3, article X, of the charter
gives to the Board of Health the man
agement and control *. â¢ â¢ of all
matters pertaining to the preservation
promotion and protection of the lives
and health of the inhabitants of the
city and county." It must be appar
ent that the board may exercise this
plenary power in any manner that may
seem to it best for the promotion and
protection of the health and the lives
of the people. It must a'.3o be appar
ent that physicians can direct sanitary
hygienic and medical matters better
than laymen. The Board of Health ad
vised the Civil Service Commission in
October, 1900, that sanitary inspectors
should be graduates in medicine. In
February, 1903, that board advised this
commission that "the duties of sanitary
inspectors in this department make it
necessary that they should be physi
cians." The board, as now constituted
is evidently of the same opinion.
The charter (article XIII) exempts
from civil service "all physicians ap
pointed by or on the Board of Health "
We must conclude, therefore, that the
Inspecting physicians, being appointed
as physicians to do. professional work,
arc exempt from the jurisdiction of this
commission. This is undoubtedly the
law of the case. Nevertheless, it is
with regret that this conclusion is
reached, for we would have much pre
ferred-to sustain the protest of the
sanitary inspectors, rather than to
overrule it, which we are forced to do.
ASSISTANT WARDEX.
The duties, of the assistant warden,
as set forth by the Board of Health
are as follows:
Assistant Warden â The assistant
warden shall assist the warden in the
performance of the executive duties, in
the management of the City and Coun
ty' Hospital, and shall be under . the
warden's direction. In case of the ab
sence or inability of the warden to act,

OX IiOND PROGRAMME
The meeting will be in charge of
the following committee: Mrs. C. H.
Redington (chairman). Rev. Charles
R. Brown and Charles E. Keyes.
OAKLAND, Jan. 28. â Desiring to
secure closer co-operation between the
various churches of this city and the
Associated Charities the latter organi
zation has arranged a meting to take
place to-morrow afternoon at the
chapel of the First Congregational
Church, Thirteenth and Clay streets,
and all the ministers of Oakland, re
gardless of creed, have been invited
to attend and take part in an informal
discussion of the following question:
"How can the Associated Charities
help the clergy and how can the
churches more helpfully co-operate
with the Associated Charities?"
It is likely that the subject of the
newly organized charities indorsement
committee " will also be brought up.
Every one interested in philanthropic
work is cordially invited to attend the
meeting, which will be the first of its
kind in the State.
Associated Charities Calls Meeting of
Oakland Clergy to Discuss
Important Work.
DESIRE TO SECURE
CLOSER CO-OPERATION
merit the city waÂ« justified In assuming a like
risk.
The committee realized that it Is not such
a plant as would now be designed and built,
that its water requires nitration, that the ele
vation of Its reservoir is low, and that ita
distributing system In parta is old and in many
places the pipe line Is too small for adequate
service.
But the purchase Is advocated on the ground
that the city should own its own water sup
ply, end the committee is forced to confess
that the Contra Costa water scheme Is the
oniy available one in existence Â«.nd known
to po.-bpku the supply needed for the present
Â«nÂ«i in the near future.
With the willingness of the company to sell
and the dtsnositi'in of thÂ» city to buy it is,
aft<r nil. only a disagreement as to value, and
they DropoM to settle thin by arbitration. â¢ â¢
PRUDEXT BUSINESS TO BUY.
Jn the last analysis the city will be com
pelled to buy its competitor, and It will be
prudunt business to buy it at a proper value
now.
But the proposal goes still further. The city
muy lease the property for twenty years at
S oer cent on the commission's valuation, with
the right to purchase at any time. during the
lire of the leane.
The committee regarded this as a temporary
expedient; but let me point out how the free
dom of action which it gives the city dissolves
all the difficulties that are Immediately be
fore ue.
The water problem completely blocked the
satisfactory consideration of all other schemes
for public Improvement, for $7,^50,000 will j
not be sufficient to cover the cost of a water
syrtem plus that of the various other schemes
thct are pushed before the notice of the Coun
cil, aiid. in this case, which of the many could
be selected to satisfy the public and at the
same time keep within the limit?
The Council may not offer propositions that
wlU exceed the bond issue legally available ex
ceptin? at the risk of invalidating the entire
proceedings.
Public impatience began to manifest itself
at the delay In the report, and public mur
murs were heard that this water question
should not be kept in the forefront of atten
tion to the utter exclusion of every ' other
project.
The proposed lease solves Â«1I these diffi
culties because â <
1. The city may at once enter into posses
sion of a non-competitive water buoiness.
2. it may borrow for twenty years, if de-
Flrcd. the capital of the owners at 5 per cent
per annum net.
r.. If it wishes to incur a bonded indebted
n*sÂ» for the purchase it may at any time do
so and retire the debt.
4. Il it wishes to keep inUet for other uses
the $7,250,000 of possible bond issue the lease
will udmlt of tnat nollry, because with the
control of the business and an economical
management It is easily possible to make the
business net a profit of 10 per cent, half of
which wold 'be nald an rental, and the bal
ance may be applied annually to the reduc
tion of ibe principal, to that within the
twenty years the property could be paid for
without King sensibly felt by the community.
ft. This elastloity will enable the city to
aiKUtnp towaad the water question and the
other projects any |K>sitIon it desires. The dif
ficulties that surround the water problem may
with -safety be put aside for a more conven
ient reason and meantime the development of
the oiher schemes may be undertaken with
vigor.
And nowâ "who hath believed our report?"
The committee. In the performance of a
thankless publ'c duty, has courageously stated
it* recommendations. It has not been prompt
ed by favoritism for one scheme nor by ani
mosity for another, but was guided solely by
whÂ«t it regarded as the clear business Interest
of Oakland. It has chowfi you not an aca
demic but a practical solution of the problem.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
To assist his daughter in prosecuting
her work as a missionary, James L.
Barker, a pioneer citizen and well
known business man, has arranged that
the proceeds 'of a business block that
is now being finished for him at the
corner of Adeline and Harmon streets
shall go to her. It is estimated that
the block Will bring in from rentals
at least $1800 a year, and all is to be
given to the missionary. The building
is to be christened the "India block,"
in hc/rÂ»or of the country In which the
young woman labors.
Miss Lydia Gertrude Barker is the
name of this intrepid and lucky young
woman. She has been in India eight
years, conducting a mission at Madura,
an interior town, and only recently re
turned to her Berkeley home for a rest.
Miss Barker received her education at
the old Harmon Seminary and after
ward studied at the Dwight L. Moody
Institute in Chicago. After her grad
uation she was engaged by the Ameri
can Board of ForeiRn Missions, the
Congregational society, to take up the
work in India, in which she has been
always successful.
With the money she receives from
the rental of the India block Miss Bar
ker hones to extend the work upon
which she has been engaged. That sum
will go a great way in India and any
amount of gc-od may be done with it.

OAKLAND, Jan. 28.â Pretty Norah
Jordan, 17 years old, was arrested to
day for the theft of silks, a gold pin
and $13 50 from Mrs. Mollie Edelstein,
residing at 662 Fifth street. The stolen
articles, except the money, were re
covered from the girl's home at 662
East Thirty-third street by Detective
Quigley, who was compelled to arrest
the erring young woman.
Contrite and. tearful, the youthful
prisoner confessed that she had taken
her mistress' money and property be
cause she had been sorely tempted to
dress herself as other girls of her ac
quaintance did.
Miss Jordan had been employed at
the Edelsteins only one day when the
family missed the goods and coin.
Suspicion was directed to the new
girl. Mrs. Edelstein swore out a
search warrant for the recovery of the
coin and silks. The jewelry was found
during the seaAh by the detective.
In view of the confession and the re
covery of the property the girl will
probably not be prosecuted.

Councilman Howard announced to
night In council committee that Coun
cilman Pendleton and himself have de
cided to begin a systematic and com
prehensive study of the needs of their
ward, the Fifth, as to streets and side
walk improvements, that a start may
be made toward a general Investiga
tion of those conditions throughout the
city. As set forth by Mr. Howard, the
plan includes a districting of the ward
and the immediate organization of the
property owners and prominent citizens
for expression of views.
"The great obstacle in the way of
annexation of Berkeley and Alameda,"
said Councilman Howard, "is the claim
by both cities that they are better
equipped than Oakland in almost every
respect. If members of the city gov
ernment will get the house of Oakland
in order, then they may invite these
cities to unite with us."
Councilman Elliott Indorsed the plan
for the Second Ward and Councilman
Cuvellier for himself and Councilman
Fitzgerald approved the scheme for the
Third Ward.

With William Giceg.
BERKELEY, Jan. 28. â William
Greeg, a walking delegate for the
Teamsters' Union, attempted to induce
the men working for the Schmidt
Brothers on the grading for the new
California Hall to join the union this
morning and was hustled off the si>te
by William J. Schmidt, one of the
brothers. Schmidt charged Greeg
with interfering with his workmen
and ordered him away. When the
walking delegate refused to go
Schmidt grabbed him by the arm and
forced him away.
The Schmidts employ union and
non-union men, who work together,
the union men apparantly regardless
of their affiliations. Several months
ago a walking delegate who attempted
to interfere with the contractors was
beaten by them, and subsequently
they were fined $100 in the Justice's

Tries to Tell X'ame.
OAKLAND, Jan. 28. â After lying
unconscious at the Receiving Hospital
for four days with a fractured skull,
the unidentified man found, in the
stables of the. Oakland Gas, Light and
Heat Company, awoke this morning
and tried to tell his name. He took
some coffee, but was so weak that
he was unable to pronounce clearly.
It seemed as if he tried to say Henry
Nelson, or Hanranhan. Steward
Borchert now believes the man has a
chance to recover.

Talk of spiritualism, Moab has a

The late Charles Foster was noted for
his goodfellowship. It enabled him to
break into the lines of all parties when
he had need cf votes outside his own.
When he first ran for Governor of Ohio
his opponents undertook to heap ridi
cule on him by dubbing him "Calico
Charlie," because he ran a country dry
goods stcre. "Calico Charlie" was equal
to the emergency, however. He ar
ranged \t that calico should become the
badge of the campaign. It was used
for declarations at public meetings,
bands were dressed in it, neckties were
made of it and campaign newspapers
were printed on calico. Ahtf "Calico

John L. Howard, chairman of the

Water Company. In all of the reports
and statements this tigure has never
been given and Mr. Howard replied "a
little over $4,000,000."
This is very important, for it is prob
able that VMb figure will be about the
biisis upon which the Council will lix
water rates this year.
Mr. Howard's address* before the

of the plant <-f the Contra Costa Water

* 2. The eofrt rtf this suit incurred by the wa
ter eortipar.y has been rejrularly included in the
expense account, and us the rates have been
Tixed to j ield a net return, the citizens have
paid heavy Interest on this cost, which iv â¢ are
informed li&s reached a total of $250,000.
3. A* a. last consequence the city of Oak
land has i>aid during the past four years the
ric^esi rat"* ior water with which it has ever
, Leen charged.
cMr. Howard then outlined the work
t>f the Council committee by which Mr.
Fitzgerald had made a valuation of
the riant of the Contra Costa Water
Company, which he asserted was not
satisfactory to the company; told how
a proposition hnd b^en submitted and
then withdrawn by the Bay Cities Wa
11 ter Company, and then he told how the
proposition submitted by the Contra
Costa Water Company came to be
sijmed, saying: *
In the early i.ait of January the committee
found that after month* of labor it was con
fronted with the di!--apre~able fact that noth
1'n* had been accomplished, that nothing was
!iA view but the <"ontra f'osta Water Company,
and between that company and the commit
tee there was an unbrldped chasm In lefp^ct
to values. The whole question van in the
unsatisfactory condition that it had occupied
for years.
But the knowledge gained during the al-
TnoM. daily controversies led to the pr'-para-
I tion by to* committee -of a letter which was
." nuhmttted to and without material altera
'Â« tftm stpned by th* company. There seems
* to he an attempt to throw discredit upon the
proposal becajse It appears to have emenaud
from the water <-omi>any. If it will smooth :
the way toward a more Just and unprejudiced
rubllc consideration of thle proposition we
"will Bay that the water company did not
originate nor Inepiie the letter, and the sigr
j r.ature ,,f Its president was attached not with
out demur. â¢ â¢ â¢
DISAGREE ONLY ON* VALUE.
t B IjcI us now consider this prorxisitlon with
reference to the water question and Its rela
tion to other schemes for public Improvement:
First â Tou are avrare that under the law
â¢ it Ib obligatory uprn the City Council to be-
Itin in February of rach year the work of
fixing the water rates that the company may
â¢â¢harge during: the tollowlni? ti-x-nl year.
; 7*he committee believed that the valuation
of Â»7.Â«XÂ».fX>0 as fixed by Jud^e Hart is In ex
. <-esÂ» of the value of this property. It knew
Â£ that this feeling was shared by other mem
bers of the Council and by a large portion
*jf th* community.
It te Â«f the opinion that the Council is not
' competent to fix a value, and an attempt to
lower the prt-eer.l basis of value would result
In new litigation in the I'nited Â£tat<>!Â» court.
Therefore a valuation reached hy competent
and dlEinteresU-d <xpÂ»rtÂ«, free from the fog
of courts and from the ingenious devices of
lawyer*, will remove these difficulties and
establish a foundation for rate fixing purposes
which will l>e valuable and effective, not only
for the present year but also for all succeed"
inc year*.
Secondlyâ ThÂ« proposal goes further. The
rity Is uot obligated to buy the 'hint at the
valuation fixed by the commission, but it may
do so. ...
If it desires to purchase th# system it
t-hould be willing to. pay what, by proper as
t<-Â«Ttalnment, it is worth. More than this the
water company her no right to expect.
After il* investigation the committee v,-aÂ»
of the opinion that if the water company

Behind a door Joseph saw a shot
gun standing. Without stopping to
examine it the boy picked up the
weapon, and pointed it straight at his
sister, who was so close to the gun's
mouth that she could easily have de
flected the aim had she been old
enough to realize the danger.
As soon as the shot was fired the
boy saw his sister stagger and fall to
the floor, the awful wound in her
head. AVith a scream of fright he ran
out of the house, alarming his father
and mother, who had both been star
tled by the noise of the shot. The
mangled baby was dead before the
distracted parents got to the room.
Martin went to Newark and notified
the authorities, who in turn gave the
case in charge of Deputy Coroner
Francis at Centervilld. That officer
made a thorough investigation and re
ported the facts to Coroner Mehr
mann. The v boy admitted he had killed
his sister, but in explanation declared
he thought the shotgun was not
loaded.
The father had been in the habit of
loading the weapon at night before
the family retired. They had been
much bothered by tramps on the
ranch and Martin kept the gun close
at his bedside for use should occasion
require. The father had heretofore
made a practice of withdrawing the
cartridges in the morning, but to-day
Martin did not touch the gun as usual.
It was left in the bedroom' corner un
til after the boy used the weapon with
such distressing result.
Coroner Mehrmann will hold an in
quest to-morrow afternoon at Newark.
With a shotgun he did not know was
loaded Joseph Martin, 8 years old,
killed Mamie Martin; his baby sister,
3 years of age, this morning at ,9:30
o'clock jn a room at the Martins'
ranch house, a mile and a half from
Newark. -
The reckless boy held the weapon
aimed at his little sister's head, the
gun muzzle being not a -foot from the
baby. Joseph pulled the trigger after
raising the hammer, and the full
charge of shot tore the child's face off,
killing the baby instantly.
The scene of the tragic death was in
a bedroom off the dining-room, where
shortly before the accident the chil
dren had been rating breakfast with
their parents, Mr. and Mrs. Frank
Martin. After the morning menl had
been finished little Mamie and her
brother sauntered into the sleeping
room.

SANTA CLARA. Jan. 28.â The inter
collegiate baseball game to-day be
tween the Stanford varsity nine and
Santa Clara College resulted in a score
of 11 to 10 in favor of Stanford. The
game was one-sided until the eighth,
when Santa Clara had her only chance
to tie the score. Stanford filled the
bases in the first. An error by Terry
McKune and a fumbie by Magee gave
the Stanford men three runs. Two in
the third and four Jn the fourth gave
them a lead that made a plodding game
till the eighth. Santa Clara played
lazy ball till the eighth, when they
woke up, and it was 11 to 10, with Stan
ford on the long end. In the ninth
Stanford went out one, two. three, and
the college came to the stick for a last
attempt. One man reached second with
two out. but the game ended with the
score as above. Sales and Parker
pitched for Stanford, with Ball receiv
ing. Wallman and McKune were the
battery for Santa Clara. Runs by in

The members of St. Dominic's Mon
astery and SL Dominie's Church were
greatly shocked when the news of the
death of the Rev. Father James Louis
O'Xeil came to them yesterday.-
The eminent priest and scholar died
yesterday morning at St. Joseph's
Hospital, where he was being attend
ed for a fracture sustained through
being thrown from a Jones-street ca
ble car on December 29 through the
sudden stopping of the car as it start
ed down trade between Bush and
ijutter streets. The immediate cause
of death, however, was pneumonia,
which developed about a week ago.
At 3:20 o'clock yesterday afternoon
the remains of the late Father O'Xeil
were received at St. Dominic's Church
by the Very Rev. Pius Murphy, the
coffin being borne by Father F. B.
Clyne, Father T. C. Clancy, Father
Gregory Ilourke, Father T. C. Warren,
Father F. S. Welch and Father J. R.
Newell. As the procession moved
along the aisle the priests chanted the
offices of the dead, while the bell
above the church was tolled. The
Very Rev. Father Murphy sprinkled
the casket with holy water and the
remains were tenderly laid upon a
small catafalque and will lie in state
until to-morrow morning, when the
funeral service will begin at 10 o'clock
with solemn high requiem. The body
will be escorted from the church at -
o'clock and will be taken to St. Dom
inic's Church, Benicia, where solemn
high requiem will take place on Sun
day. . The interment will be in the
St. Dominican Cemetery, Benicia.
The late Father O'Xeil was born in
Brooklyn. X. Y., August 7, 1858. His
mother died about six months ago in
Brooklyn and surviving Father O'Neil
are his father, James O'Neil, and a
brother and sister.

POPULAR CATHOLIC PRIEST
WHO DIED OF PNEUMONIA
YESTERDAY MORNING.
A. policeman, glad of the relief thi3
diversion offered from the tedium of the
night, had any possible suspicions al
layed when the leader of the band ap
peared from within and directed the
work in hand just as the proprietor
mi^ht have done.
"Hurry up, my friends," he said; "I
have a train to catch."
The men hurried. They got about
37,000 francs' worth of merchandise into
the cart in time for "monsieUr" to catch
his train, and the policeman resumed
his visils.
M. Maauet discovered his loss next
morning. Then one clew led to an
other and the whole band was arrested.
They will try* to prove their innocence.
Besides the four men implicated a wo
man, a second-hand dealer of the rue
Pigalle, has also been arrested for re
ceiving some of the stolen property.â
Petit Parisien.
An interesting case is now occupying
the attention of one of tne Paris crim
inal courts, which, according to ths
evidence, shows that the Parisian burg
lar is not wanting in audacity. The
case concerns the robbery of the sta
tioner's shop of M. Maquet in the rue
do la Paix, committed last July.
It appears that a brave policeman
stood by and watched the robbery com
mitted. The chief of the band had or
dered a pushcart to the front of the
store. As he had formerly worked for"
M. Maquet and knew the premises well,
he passed into the courtyard of the
building, forced an entrance and opened
the front door. There were his con
federates and their cart.

"Much of the distance across Kansas
was done at a mile a minute speed. A
noticeable thing about the race against
death was the quickness of our engine

cials are much gratifk- 1 over the show
ing made by this train in breaking past
records, but we can do better."
MILWAUKEE. Jan. 2S.â Mrs. M. L.
Cunningham of Butte. Mont., mother of
Mrs. Charles W. Clark, who died in
New York last night, missed arriving
at the bedside of her daughter before
Mrs. Clark died because a train be
tween Milwaukee and Chicago arrived
in Chicago one minute late. Mrs. Cun
ningham, who had been visiting in Mil
waukee, left for New York Tuesday
morning on a 4 o'clock train, after re
ceiving belated telegrams announcing
her daughter's critical condition, and
expected to take a 6 o'clock train out
of Chicago the same morning. The
trair from Milwaukee to Chicago was
one minute late and Mrs. Cunningham
failed to make the connection.
"The most remarkable feature of the
train's flight was its great speed
through the mountains. It did better
work there than on the level country
farther east. The special crossed three
mountain ranges, including the Conti
nental Divide.- No delays were encoun
tered in the mountains and the speed
made was something new in railroad
experience. If the same approximate
speed had been maintained east of the
mountains the train would have
reached Chicago four hours sooner.
The special, which left Albuquerque,
N. M., at 5:'45 a. m. yesterday, made
the trip to Chicago, 1377 miles, in
thirty-two hours and live minutes,
which is four hours and filty-flve min
utes faster than the time ot the Santa
Fe's . fast California Limited, and
twenty-five minutes faster than the
lime of the westbound Lowe special of
last August.
Mr. Clark was exhausted on reach
ing Chicago. He boarded a Lake
Shore and Michigan Southern train
this afternoon and resumed his jour
ney to New York.
TOPEKA; Kans.. Jan. 28.â W. J.
Black, general passenger and ticket
agent of the Santa Fe, says concerning
the Clark special train, which reached
Chicago this alternoon:
"It was 'the fastest run ever made
on our road, taking all things into con
sideration. The train started from
Winslow. Ariz., at 11:28 o'clock Tues
day night and reached. Chicago to-day
at 1:50 p. m. The run of 1663 miles was
made therefore in thirty-seven hours
and fifteen minutes. This is an aver
age of 44 u miles an hour, including all
stops and delays. r .
CHICAGO, Jan. 28.â The Santa Fe
special, on which Charles W. Clafk
started in a record-breaking attempt
to reach the bedside of his dying wife
in New York, reached Chicago at 1:50
p. m. to-day. Mr. Clark had been no
tified of his wife's death.

concerning it is that it may sidetrack
the whole proposition, for the members

Western State, cf which there is at
least one other active candidate with
warm champions in the House and

replied: "Well, if you think your friend
is in that bundle, I'll get it down, too."
âPhiladelphia Evening Telegraph.
"WASHINGTON. Jam. 28.â The House
for an hour to-day was entertained by
a speech erf J. Adam Bede, a Repub
lican member from Minnesota, who
made his maiden effort and won his
spurs. .His remarks were replete with
wit- and humor, as well as serious
thought.
Good natured colloquys resulted from
his thrusts at the Democratic party.
Bede appealed to the Democratic party i
to disband, and extended to it an in- j
vitation to jc-in the Republican ranks-,'
and make the election of Mr. Roose- j
velt unanimous. ;
When invited by a member of the 1
minority to join the Democratic ranks,
he inquired who their candidate would ]
be, but no name was forthcoming. â¢ The |
only oppositic-n to Roosevelt, he de- '
clared, came from a little '"bunch of j
Populists" down in Wall street. The
election returns from the West, he said,'
would simply be -supplemental census
figures. ;
Bede. in referring to Populists, said i
he meant the people who dealt in fiat, j
He said flat had been wiped out in the j
West.
"We went out when we saw a Popu
list," he said, "and threw salt on his
whiskers and caught him and brought
him into the Republican ranks. We
have wiped out Populism in the West,
and it soon will be determined that
a little bunch of Populists in | Wall
street cannot dictate the nomination of
either party."
Bede said he thought that 50 per cent
of the Democrats of Minnesota believed
in Mr. Roosevelt, and that Minnesota
would give him 100,000 majority.
"I believe," he said, "if the Demo
crats should nominate Mr. Cleveland
or Mr. Gorman that even Mr. Bryan
himself would cast his vote for Roose
velt."
Scudder of New York questioned
Bede as to how he proposed uniting
the two races, referring to a remark
made toward the conclusion of Bede's
speech. Bede replied that he had not
referred in any way to the race ques
tion. He realized that peculiar condi
tions had brought peculiar burdens for
the South in this matter and he would
not by word or deed do anything to
add one featherweight to this burden.
This statement was applauded on the
Democratic side.
Speaking of the Monroe doctrine.
Bede said that the doctrine was just
as bit? as the United States navy and
no bigger. Do away With the navy
and the Monroe doctrine would go.
Benny of New Jersey, speaking in
defense of Bryan, said he. need not feel
hurt, as he was in good company. He
quoted Senator Dolliver as having said
at a banouet In New York that no
man had a right to hiss the name of
William J. Bryan.
"You brag and blow here about the |
great courace of the man who is now
President of the United States," said
Benny. "The man who shoots a lion j
or a Spaniard in the back does not
necessarily- have to be courageous."
'The prophecy that to nominate Mr. I
, Roosevelt for Vice President would
take him out of New York politics did
not come true. He said it was pro
posed to stop the use of carriages by
department officials, and asked if any
thing was done to stop the use o-f car
riages by department officials, and
asked if anything was being done to
stop the President from using a free
: train, declaring that he had heard that
a free train was placed at his disposal.
PARTY LEADERS IN DEBATE.
Scope of the President's Authority the
Theme in Senate.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28. â The time
of the Senate to-day was devoted to
debate, rather than to speeches, on
the attitude of the United States to
ward the Panama revolution. There
was a variation, however, in that the
discussion also had reference to the
right of the President to withhold in
formation called for by the Senate.
The foundation of the controversy
was the Democratic caucus resolution
calling- UDon the President to state
whether he has yet supplied all the
papers in the archives bearing. upon
the Panama affair.
The debate was opened by Culber
son and was participated in by Gor
man and Bacon on the Democratic
side and by Cullom, Spooner and
Lodge on the Republican side of the
chamber. The Democrats contended
for the right of the Senate to demand
information in the possession of the
executive bearing: upon the treaties
before the Senate, while the Republi
cans spoke in defense of the Presi
dent to withhold information.

The Clerk Was Obliging.
a The trials of the salespeople in the
large department stores are manifold
I these days, but many an amusing in-
J cident crops out to Irradiate their ex-
I istence. It was not so many days ago
when one of those fussy little women
walked ud to the counter of the black

1 some "crepe de chine." Not satisfied
! *-ith the kind produced, she compelled
i the obliging clerk to pull down every
bundle on the various shelves until
only one solitary package remained on
the very top row. -Without any con
sideration for the patience of the oblig
ing salesman, she finally turned and re
marked: "Oh, that's all right. I was
just looking for a friend, anyway."

TERBA MATEâ Sutter Club. Sacra
mento^ Cal. Yerba mate- or Paraguay
tea, is used exclusively In South Amer
ica as a substitute for tea. It consists
of the leaves and green shoot3 of a cer
tain species of the holly. The latin
name of this species is Ilex Faracuay
ensis. The leafy portion Is reduced to
a coarse powder, and the twigs being
In a more or less broken state. The
term mate was originally from the lan
guage of the Incas and was "yerva de
mate," but in time yerva'was dropped.
In later years yerba. meaning herb,
was substituted. The term mate, which
by usage has attached to the so-called
tea, .13 the Incas name for gourds or
calabashes. In such vessels, often
trained into curious forms during
growth, a small quantity of the leaves
and twigs are placed and Infused with
boiling water. The equivalent of the
term yerba do mate is the herb of the
gourd or calabash. In South America
the loving cup principle applies to the
tea. The gourd or calabash in which It
is infused is brought to those who in
tend to imbibe. Each is provided with
a small tube about eight Inches in
length called a bombilla, mad& o f bas
ket work of wonderful fineness to act
as a strainer and prevent the fine parti
cles from being drawn into the mouth.
He dips In this instrument and sucks
up a smÂ«" portion of the Infusion,
then passes the mate on to the next
person. It is usual to drink it exceed
ingly hot. Its effect is the same as
tea, stimulating and restorative, having
a large proportion of the principle

IN the annual report upon the conditions in the de
partment under his charge which Postmaster Gen
eral H. C. Paj'ne has just submitted to the President,
several deficiencies in the workings of the .postoffice arc
pointed out and strong recommendations made for im
proved methods of operation. Payne pays especial at
tention to the recently organized system of rural free de
livery, reporting it to be in. the main proficient, but urg
ing changes which will render its operations of wider
and more perfect application.
One of the results of the rural free delivery system,
according to the Postmaster General, is to render more
imperative the necessity ,of providing for the transmission
of small sums through the medium of' postal orders.
"As the rural free delivery service- has been extended,"
says Payne," "the number of letters carrying small
amounts of. currency has greatly increased. \ At present
there is no convenient method provided in the rural dis
tricts for: making such remittance through the mails ex
cept in currency or. postage stamps,, and such currency
and stamp remittances are a constant temptation to those
handling them." .('."Â¦
Â¦' A serious defect in the operation of the rural delivery
system is noted by the Postmaster General. He; reports
that the privilege accorded rural carriers of doing ex
press package business for their individual profit and
aside from their duties in the Government employ has
resulted, in many instances, in the carriers neglecting
their mail delivery for the more lucrative opportunities
offered by the private delivery business. In one instance
Paj r ne reports that the rural carriers-'organized and ex
acted weekly toll from the publishers "of newspapers to
insure the delivery of their papers. The head of the
postoffice recommends that cither the compensation of

Albatross Cakezvalk.
In the Laysan Islands of the Pacific
the albatross is very tame and very
abundant. A naturalist, in an exchange,
thus describes the so-called dance or
"cakewalk," as . the. sailors call it, of
these interesting birds: "Two alba
trosses approach each other bowing
profoundly and stepping rather heav
ily. They circle around each other
nodding solemnly all the time. Next
they fence a little, crossing bills and
whetting them together, peeking mean
while and dropping stiff little blows.
Suddenly "one lifts its closed wing and
nibbles at the feather underneath, or,
rarely, if in a hurry, merely turns its
head and tucks its bill under its wing.
The other bird during this short per
formance assumes a statuesque pose
and cither looks mechanically from
fiide to side or snaps its bill loudly a
fovr times.- Then the first bird bows
once and, pointing its head and beak
straight upward, rises on its toes, puffs
out its breast and utters a prolonged
nasal groan, the ether bird snapping
its bill loudly and rapidly at the same
time. When they have finished they
begin bowing at each other again, al
most always rapidly and alternately,
and presently repeat the performance.
"Sometimes three of the birds will
engage in the play, one dividing its
attention between two. They are al
ways most polite, never losing . their
temper or offering any violence. They
begin bowing and walking about as
if their very lives depended upon it.
If (rnc stands where albatrosses are
reasonably abundant he can see as
many as twenty couples hard at work
bowing and groaning: on all Bides, and
paying not the slightest attention to his
presence. When walking through the
grassy portions of the Island' I have
seen white heads bobbing up and down
above the green, as solitary pairs were
amusing themselves away from the
larger conerecatlons of their kind. If
I walked up to them they would stop
and gaze In Â« deprecating way arid
walk off, bowing . still, with one eye
in my direction. Having reached what
they considered a respectful distance,
they would fall to and resume their
play,"

A Bashful Muse.
It is not generally known that Attor
ney Charles S. Wheeler is a writer of
no mean ability. The â¢ following . re
markably strong though grisly poem of
his was printed in the Argonaut In 1885
under his initials only and the author
ship would have probably remained a
secret with the editor had not some
perfidious friend dragged the Wheeler
muse into the open:
THE RULING PASSION.
Full many a dank, unwholesome fume
Hung o'er the grim dissecting room,
Where, all. intent upon his toil.
With no companion but the grim.
Cold being 1 that confronted him,
A student burned the midnight oil.

The "subject" over which he bent
Had shielded as its tenement
A fallen soul. One of the kind
Who, hiding from the social frown.
Renounced the wide world for the town.
To honor lost, to virtue blind.

So that the flesh might best Invite
The student's knife. With eager eye
He followed nerve and muscle spare,
Laid ganglia and membrane bare,-
With headTjpnt to his "subject" nigh.
He cut a cord. The upraised arm
Drawn downward and with gruesome
charm
His neck embraced with amorous fold
"The ruling passion strong in death."

THE echo of denunciation of the President as the
friend of Russia has hardly subsided before, from
the same source, comes another attack that is in
teresting because of its novelty. A Southern writer has
found the key to the future. lie declares that our foreign
policy is the only live question of the day, and desires no
platform for the Democracy but Washington's Farewell
Address.
In explanation he adds: "Of course before the election
the administration is for neutrality between Russia and
Japan. Next year it will not be. England is using the
puffed up and obtuse Japanese as she wishes to use us.
The Roosevelt wing of the Republican party will do as
England wants done. There is no treason to our race
among the Pacific Coast people; and if Democrats will
leave 16 to 1 in cold storage for the present, the hatred of
Californians, Oregonians and Washingtonians for the
Japanese will carry those States against, an administra
tion that is helping the yellow and hindering the white
party to the Russo-Japanese trouble."
There you are! Just now the President was accused of
backing Russia and that lead was worked out, and now
comes this distinguished and learned doctor of interna
tional law to declare that the merits of a controversy are
not to : be sought in the principles involved, but in the
color/of the parties!
; The country is asked to put the Democratic party in s
'power because it will'adopt that simple rule in interna-
I tional affairs and probably mob-in Washington the lega
tions of Siani,\ China, Japan, Persia and. Turkey, and
send their Ministers out of the country clad in a close
fitting suit of feathers and tar. The writer is another
witness to the sad decadence of a party that ruled the
country for sixty years, and their in 1896 crawled into \
silver mine and died. - .

influences operating in his stomach, wants to kill Presi

Umbrellas in Rank.
In Java the umbrellas of the Sultan
and the Dutch Governor General are
covered entirely with gold embroidery;
then those of the Princes possess a few
threads less tinsel, and so on down
from the higher nobles until the ordi
nary citizen walks abroad with an um
brella on which there is no gold at all.
As this law applies also to the um
brellas of the Javanese ladies,- one can
happily perceive at a glance "who's
who" among them. Personages of dis
tinction in Java, however, never carry
their own umbrellas. A Cabinet min
ister of the Sultan is always attended
by his umbrella bearer, who holds the
emblem of rank over his master's head,
marching in a kind of procession. But
should the servant be merely going to
meet his master he bears the umbrella
over his shoulder with the same dig
nity, though closed instead of open.
The furled umbrella is still emblematic
of its owner's rank.â Four Track News.

that the time-expired man should feel
at liberty to make his new-found and
well-financed freedom the occasion for
celebration.

the station keeper counted the coin

THE Democratic party seems to have what is called
Â¦down South "a hant," by which name are* known
all the sights and sounds to which superstition
gives a fearful meaning.. A man who is supposed to be
under supernatural discipline is not said to be haunted,
but to have "a haut." Not long ago in Virginia a negro
girl died, and soon after a negro woman next door had
"a hant" and died in hysterical fright. Very soon another
negro woman's fancy pictured- on the frosty window
pane the forms of t\vo dead women and a strange man,
and her "hant" threw her into a screaming fit that drew
the whole colored neighborhood, and they all had "a
hant," and the police had to come and quiet them.
The Democratic leaders in Congress have "a hant."
We believe that "our hypnotic Representative, Mr. Liver
nash, took it in the extra session. He was followed
about by the ghost of the prerogatives of the House and
conceived that they had been murdered at the White
House, -and their Â¦ poor pale shades were castanetting
with their toothless jaws or jawless teeth, to induce him
to avenge them. From that start, one after another has
had "a hant." Senator Daniel sees on the frosty pane
the constitution lying dead, while the President dances
on its poor, and pitifully cold stomach. He takes hysterics
and screams: Then Senator Morgan looks up in the
swaying branches of the leafless sycamores and sees
death riding the pale horse.. He rushes into the Senate
to interpret his vision as "Roosevelt the man on horse
back," and in their hysteria the other^ who sympathize
with him don't know what to do, but think
that to keep the man on horseback from, com
ing we would better prohibit horses, and ' then,
of course, the man on horseback would have
to come on foot. Senator Carmack, looking at the
verdigris on the Goddess of Liberty over the dome of the
Capitol, thinks it is a shroud, and seeing one eye drop
out of the head of the Muse of History on the Peace
monument below runs wild-eyed to his seat and gets
recognized to announce the death of Liberty and the dis
ability of the Mu&Â£ of History as the work of the Presi
dent who goes around wiping things off the face of the
earth.
If it were real it would be of no higher rank than the
"hant" of the Virginia negroes. Washington and every
President since who, as a man of action, left a useful im
pression upon history and upon our institutions has been
the cause of "a hant" to hysterical politicians. Jefferson
destroyed the country, and so did Jackson, Polk, Lincoln,
Grant, Cleveland and McKinley, according to the politi
cal neurotics. Yet it seems to have survived several de
structions and is left beautiful to look upon, only that
Roosevelt may destroy it once more:
But while all of this hair-raising. "hant" goes on, the
quiet and sensible people of all parties are behind the
President, holding up his hands and telling him to build
the' canal and they will do the rest. ' >

Bag punching is to the boxer what

ist; what a dictionary is to the student.
Not only does the punching bag teach
the best and easiest way of delivering
blows and of "getting out of the way,"
but it is also the best all-around form
of exercise I know of. It is as useful

POLITICAL HYSTERICS.
As executor of the Bennett estate William Jennings
Bryan has decided that his claim for $50,000 as a con
tested legatee is justified and he must be paid. There
seems to be only one element of success lacking in Mr.
Bryan's decision. Nobody else agrees with him. .
AN incomplete experiment in New 'Zealand has in
duced many economic doctrinaires in this country
to demand laws for the compulsory arbitration of
labor disputes. The extreme desirability of preventing
long and damaging strikes has induced a great many to
join in the demand without clearly understanding
what it means, in Massachusetts compulsory arbitration
and profit sharing were yoked together, and the Legisla
ture ordered a "commission of inquiry into both. This
commission has just reported against both propositions.
This was to have been expected by any one who is fa
miliar with the cause and genius of our social and politi
cal institutions. Compulsory arbitration means not
merely that "all disputes must be arbitrated, but that line
decision must be enforced. Suppose that in such a dis
pute the award is against workingmen, it would mean
that they must return to work for the other party to the
dispute on the terms fixed by the arbitrators. Such com
pulsion is a violation of the* natural and constitutional
rights of American citizens. Work on such terms is in
voluntary servitude. A man may contract his labor to
an employer, for certain hours and wages, observing that
contract as long as he chooses, but if he choose to quit
it is not within the capacity of any' court, nor of ' the
whole Government, to compel him to continue.
This fact has led to much misunderstanding and mis
taken judgment in the case of contracts entered into by
labor unions. They cover only hours and wages while
the men choose to work. They are within their rights
when they quit and refuse to continue unless other
hours or wages are conceded. The right to labor and
use one's skill and strength to the best advantage to him
self is a supreme and superior right, with which no
government has attempted to interfere. It is the right
which distinguishes freedom from servitude. When that
right is clearly understood and the high reasons for it
become familiar, one great cause of prejudice, and misun
derstanding will be removed. It seems so clear that
compulsory arbitration destroys that freedom that it is
strange that the idea ever got any headway in this coun
try. The right to work and to quit work must be free
from any arbitrary interference by government or indi
viduals, lest there be created a system of servitude to
one or the other.
A system of compulsory profit sharing is equally ob
jectionable. It was proposed that by law this should be
substituted for the present wage system. Such a method
would be compulsory extension of the law of partner
ship to the employes in any industry. It would mean
loss sharing as well as profit sharing, since it would sum
marily put an end to all business if the employer were
compelled to stand all the losses but to divide all the
profits. If the partnership were made equal, the homes
and property of the workmen would have to be pledged
for the borrowed capital upon which nine-tenths of the
country's business is done. In the nature of things the
workmen could not maintain oversight of the business,
as their skill lies in a different direction. As long as
there were profits to share it would go well with them,
but when there were no. profits it would mean that they
mUst continue working without any compensation at all,
which would be involuntary servitude. ., . ..
The two plans imply artificial and arbitrary interfer
ence with the rights of man. Neither is workable, and it
is to be hoped that the Massachusetts report will end
their discussion in this country. 'We have h^ad no condi
tion under our existing system that is not preferable to
either of them. Our history so far proves the superior
ity of institutions which protect every man in the pursuit
of his interests' and his happiness in his own way, unre
strained except by law.
We are well aware that we may be asked if an em
ployer have no security when he takes a contract based
upon the current time and wage scale, and may lose in
its performance by his workmen demanding more wages
and less hours? His protection is in the freedom of all
rpen to labor or to quit work. If his wage and time
scales are adjusted to the natural conditions, that free
dom is his protection. Indeed it protects him b etter
than compulsory arbitration would, bccause.no man will
put fidelity into his work when it is compulsory.
The Height of Infamy.
They were discussing the > daring of

said the mate.V'but s'help me if I don't

boat to run our lines to- shore. One
'eaves in sight. I 'ails It.

"I 'ails the boat, tells 'em what's ap

'Hall right, matey. Give us a 'eaving

"I throws the 'eaving line. They
grabs it. snatches it out of my 'and
and that's the last I seen of 'awser or

boat that 'ad really been hengaged to
run our lines comes alongside, but

COMPULSORY ARBITRATION.
suspended, is best for home use; the
flat "ceiling" being noisier and more
expensive. The bag should hang from
a rope Just long enough to allow the
center of the sphere to touch the plat
form. Wooden or iron supports come
with these platforms and can be
screwed to the wall at the . required
height. To further assure the platform
from "snringrins:" or getting shaky un
der the great strain put upon it, I re
enforced the supports of mine with two
heavy joists of wood.

Now for practical work.
Take up the first position in boxing,
left foot foremost, right toe about
eighteen inches behind left heel, knees
unbent, shoulders slightly back and
head erect. Each hand, when not in
use, should fall back to the regular
"en guard" pose. ,
Hit out with your left in the regular
"Jeft lead," striking the bag as nearly
as possible on the imaginary spot mid
way between tc-p and bottom. Throw
the weight of the shoulder and of the
body into the blow. As the bag is not
your sparring partner, you can "slug"
it with all your strength. By use of
the bag only can you give full force to
your blows, and determine accurately
your hitting power and scope of reach.
When you land this first blow the
bag will fly back against the ring of
the platform and will rebound.
If you are standing close to the plat
form at the time the bag will probably
strike you full in the face on the re
bound. To avoid this, move your head
quickly to one side, or else step back
out of reach.
Perhaps you think it is an easy mat
ter for a beginner to hit the punching
bag a straight blow and make it re
bound to the place whence it started.
If so, your first blow will undedeive
you. The bag will fly off at all sorts
of weird angles. It is difficult, until
you learn the trick by experience, to
hit the bag in such a way as to make
it strike the ring and return to the
desired point. A very little practice,
however, will teach you how to gauge
the force and direction of your blows.
Continue this left hand lead until you
can hit the bag on its return bound
and send it back again. Begin slowly.
Hit the bag with your left fist, just
hard enough to make it touch the op
posite side of the platform and bounce
back. Then, as it returns, hit it again
with your left. Increase the force of
your blows as rapidly as you are able
to make your accuracy in hitting keep
pace with them. If you cannot in the
beginning hit the bag on its first re
bound wait and hit it on fhe second.
When you have learned to hit it with
tolerable accuracy "with 1 the left lead
with the right instead, and go through
the same course of accustoming your
self to the bag's eccentric movement.
Then lead with the left, and as the
bag rebounds lead with the right, strik
ing it alternately with right and left.
You cannot at first strike these al
ternate blows "on the first rebound.
Strike therefore with the left and then
on the second rebound with the right,
and so on. Increasing the force of your
blows until the right-left, right-left, be
comes as quick and regular as the tick
of a watch.
Do not neglect the pose of the body or
the "form" of your blows when strik
ing the bag. Do not maul, slap or paw
it. Every blow must be struck with as
much precision and form as though it
were aimed at a human opponent.
* * â¢
Having mastered the "left-right" al
ternate blows, on the second rebound,
try (slowly at first) the same blows on
the firs.t rebound. This is known as the
tattoo. With sufficient practice you
can work this tattoo so rapidly that the
beat of the bag against fists and ring
will sound like the continuous roll of a
drum. Indeed, the tattoo is sometimes
called the "roll" and takes its name
from tiie sound made by drums rolling
out the military tattoo.

This startling statement by Dr. A. D.
Bevan, who stands high in the profes
sion, has stirred up the members of the
Chicago Medical Society at their meet
ing. Several physicians sprang to their
feet to protest against . this arraign
ment. All had to admit, however, that
there is no definite remedy known and
they based their protests solely on the
contention that they might influence
the ratlent favorably by easing some
what and by the moral effect of their
presence.
CHICAGO, Jan. 2S.â 'JDrug treatment
is useless in cases of pneumonia. The
medical profession, so far as medicines
are concerned, can be of no assistance
in* the fight against this disease. The

this to the public and set to work to

BADLY INJURED MAX CLIXGS
TO COWCATCHER OF ENGINE
Victim of a Railroad Accident * Just
Outside of Chicago Passes Through^
a Terrible Experience.
CHICAGO, Jan. 28.â "Block the lim
ited! There's a man on the cow
catcher." This message, flashed along:
the Pennsylvania line, told the story of
a railroad accident just outside of Chi
cago which nearl/ cost a man's life
and which trainmen say was almost
unprecedented in their experience.
John Hancrow, while crossing the
tracks in Park Manor, was caught from
his i'ef t, hurled in the air, recaught on
the cowcatcher, and while the train
sped on nearly a mile a minute, be
Saved himself by wrapping his arms
around the iron be*am in front of the
enjfin?. Two 'of his ribs and one of his
less -viTe broken, vet in spite of a
freezing temperature, he clung for
four miles, unable to get a signal io
the engineer and fireman, who were
only a few feet behind him. Not until
telephone messages were sent ahea^l
and the train "was stopped by signal at
the River Line Station, was the man
rescued. Hancrow will probably re
cover.
Canada to Have Better Mall Service.
LONDON, Jan.. 28.â It .'s announced
here that the Canadian Government
haa made a contract with the Allan line
c" steamships for an improved mall
service between Canada and Great
Britain, to commence next August. The
British terminus of the service will be
Moville, Ireland, the - ear round, while
the Canadian terminus will be Quebec
in the summer and St. Jo.m, N. B., in
the winter. The subsidy is $10,000 a
round trip for the turbine vessels and
$5000 for the slower vessels.
Surgeon Experiments . With Radium.
VIENNA, Jan. 28.â Professor Gusen
bauer. one of the leading surgeo. ; of
Austria, has conducted successfully
experiments with radiui- for enlarge
ment of the gullet in cases of cancer
ous contraction of the esophagus,
thereby obviating the necessity of re
course to artificial nourishment.
Murder Suspect Is Released.
LOUISVILLE, Kyi, Jan. 28.â Harry
Behr, who was arrested yesterday as a
suspect in the Schafer murder case,
was released to-day upon assurances
from the Chief of Police of < Memphis
that he knew nothing of the crime.
The Governor attempted to quell the
disturbance, but he was stoned, pur
sued and obliged to seek refuge in the
palace. The authorities finally Induced
them to withdraw on the promise of
temporary withdrawal of the obnoxious
coinage. .
TANGIER, Morocco, Jan. S3.â Morocco
City has been the scene of serious dis
turbances in consequence of the Gov
ernment's attempt to force the circu
lation of new and unpopular copper
coins, on which it placed an ' artificial
value and which it is to receive in pay
ment of taxes. Business was paralyzed,
provisions became scarce and starva
tion waa threatened.
A mob, therefore, rose and first at
tacked the Christian Cemetery, lately
driven by the Sultan to the foreign mis
sions; burned down the gates, desecra
ted the graves, exhumed the bodies, cut
off their heads and paraded the town
with the heads stuck on poles. The
rioters proceeded to the Jewish quarter
with the object of destroying it, but
they found the gates closed and strong
ly guarded. The Jews were panic
stricken until they found that the pro
tection of the authorities was effective.
The rabble subsequently looted the jew
elers' shops, robbing and wounding
many Jews.
After sentence had been pronounced
Wright, when asked if some one had
not better telephone the verdict to Mrs.
Wright, replied:
"No; there is plenty of time for
that."
Taking out his watch and chain
Wright handed them to Eyre, saying:
"I shall not have any use for this in
that place," meaning the prison. "I
give them to you. Eyre. Keep It for
me."
After Wright had taken the poison,
holding a glass of whisky and water in
his hand and sipping its contents, he
said:
"Waters, give me another cigar."
Waters took up Wright's cigar case,
which was lying on a table, and Wright
deliberately cut the end off a cigar and
struck a match. Just as he was going
to light the cigar Wright flung the
match from him, sank back uncon
scious and died without uttering an
other word.
LONDON, Jan. 2S.â "Suicide" was the
verdict passed by the Coroner's jury
to-day in the closing chapter of the
tragedy of Whitaker Wright. His
death was caused by poisoning by cya
nide of potassium. From j the evidence
at the inquest it was shown that
Wright had determine'd to take his own
life in the event of an adverse verdict,
and that he went to court with a cya
nide tabloid in his possession, while in
his hip pocket was a new revolver fully
loaded and even ctfeiced. After the
sentence Wright went to the lavatory,
while the tipstaff in attendance upon
him remained outPide. There he swal
lowed the tabloid. Returning to the
consulting room he washed down the
poison with, whisky and water. One
of the last things Wright said was:
"This is British justice." Â¦

BISHOFSS ANNUAL REPORT.
Bishop Nichols read his annual re- j
port to the convention giving an ac
count of his official acts during the
year. The Bishop reported as follows:
Persons confirmed, 732; adults baptized,
14; holy communion celebrated, 63
times: burials, 13; sermons delivered, I
So; addresses given, 163: various points
visited, 139; officiated in all,. 258 times.
The Bishop reported that he had
given canonical consent to the conse
cration to the episcopate of four bishops
and had ordained eight priests and a
number of deacons and lay-readers.
The Bishop referred in feeling terms
to the death of the presiding Bishop
of the church and five other Bishops
who passed away in the last year and
also paid a tribute to the memory of
, Rev. Dr. Foute, late rector of Grace
Church, and Major W. B. Hooper and
other prominent members of the dio
cese called bv death in 1303.
The Bisjjop then dealt w ith th-e
growth ofthe church in the diocese and
reported that it was in a healthy con
dition. The finances of the diocese did
not require any assistance from the
general fund of the church. â¢
The contest for fotirth place nar
rowed down between Revs. L.. C. San
ford and M. D. Wilson, secretary of
the convention. The clergy supported
Rev. Mr. Sanford, while the laity fav
ored Rev. Mr. Wilson.
Of the four clerical delegates to be
elected three were given the requisite
vote without any trouble." In the se
lection of the fourth cleric ten ballots
were necessary before a result was an
nounced.
A volume of business was transacted
yesterday at the closing session of the
fifty-fourth convention of the Episco
pal Diocese of California held at
Grace Church.
Considerable time was taken up in
the election of delegates who trill at
tend the general convention of the
church In Boston next October.
Under the rules of the diocese two
thirds of the clerical and lay votes
cast are necessary to elect. This rule
brought about a deadlock in the elec
tion of one clerical delegate to the
general convention.
The report of the Sunday-school
committee was presented by Rev. E.
L. Parson^ and outlined the lectures
for the present year.
The convention was then declared
closed, prayer being offered by Bishop
Nichols.
CANONS FOR CIIURCHWOMEN.
The commission formed to "draw up
the canons for the new "house of
churchwomen" reported that it had
met and organiaed. Bishop Nichols
was elected chairman of the commis
sion and W. A. M. Van Bokkelen sec
retary.
The committee on canons presented
its report favoring the adoption of
the amendments to the canons re
ferred to it at the first session of the
convention. The amendments were
published in The Call last Wednesday.
The convention adopted the amend
ments as suggested by the committee.
Votes of thanks were passed to the
local clergy, to the clergy and laity
of Grace Church and to the press of
San Francisco for respective cour
tesy extended to the convention.
The report of the advisory mis
sionary committee was presented by
Rev. W. A. Brewer and dealt with the
mission work in the Pacific Coast
district. The committee suggested
the payment of $770 toward the sal
ary of a secretary, the balance of the
salarv being paid by other dioceses in
the missionary district. After some
discussion the suggestion of the. com
mittee was passed by adoption of a
resolution.
A resolution \yas adopted that "The
Pacific Christian" be bought from
its present owner for the sum of $3000
and be used as the official paper of the
d'ocese. The funds for the purchase
have already been subscribed and will
be repaid from the profits of the news
paper.
Rev. N. B. W. Gallwey presented a
report on the charities maintained by
the diocese and showed that they
were all in a good condition, but that
more funds were needed to carry on
the work.
TO PURCHASE A NEWSPAPER.
Dean W. E. Shaw, secretary of the
special committee appointed some years
ago to handle the matter, reported that
a lot had been purchased for 514,000 and
that $4000 remained in the treasury.
He said that $30,000 would be required
tc erect a suitable residence f<5r the
Bishop.
In the discussion that followed the
report some of the delegates were in
clined to censure the special committee
for lack of energy in sequring funds
for the erection of the Bishop's house.
Dean Shaw explained that the majority
of the special committee was absent in
Europe and that it was difficult to got
a meeting.
A resolution was passed that the
committeee be requested to increase
its membership, as authorized, and
that it proceed to collect the sub
scriptions promised for the Bishop's
house and proceed with the work.
The new Bishop's house will be on
Webster street, near Pacific avenue.
Bishop Nichols suggested that tb.2
convention delegates should bring be
fore the Boston gathering the possi
bility of using the referendum to settle
the vexed question of ornaments and
ceremonials in church services. The
Bishop thought that the question migftt
be settled definitely and that it wouul
promote Christian unity.
Considerable time was taken up in
discussing the matter of erecting an
official residence in San Francisco fur
the Bishop of the diocese. /
Archdeacon Emery was complimented
his valuable work, which relieved
the Bishop of many arduous duties dur
ing the oast year.
Bishop Nichols suggested that the
delegates to the next general conven
tion in Boston should bring up at that
gathering the request of the San Jose
Convocation requesting permission to
use the revised version of the Scrip
tures at morning and evening prayer.

BASKBAL.Li GAMKS
' The monthly .ield sports were of an
unusual)}- interesting character and
Cave a great amount of instructive
JMausernent to a larce number of town
i-eople. as veil as to those quartered at
the .post. The weather was perfect and
the grounds In first-class shape. Lieu
tenant Beauford R. Camp, in charge of
athletics at the. post, had arranged an
excellent orogramme, and under his
supervision it was most successfully
carried out.
Perhaps the greatest interest was
centered in the mounted athletic sports
or what is known in army life as the
â¢ monkey drill." N
The participants in this ; were mem
bers of the colored troopers of the
Ninth Cavalry and members of the field
artillery.
The horses were brought on the field
barebacked and the different contest
ants made running jumps, alighting on
the horses* backs. Then from their
backs they would turn somersaults to
the ground and gro through all sorts of
tricks and gymnastics. The horses on
the whole behaved very well except in
the case of the animal belonging to
Private Smelly, Troop I, Ninth Cavalry,
which became fractious and unruly and
had to be taken frem the field. The
animal was replaced by a horse-seven
teen hands high, and although Smelly
is deemed one of the finest athletes in
the troop, he was at a great disadvan
tage owing to the size of the substituted
animal and failed to score.
Corporal Smith won the 220-yard dash.
Tim^. :ZK 2-5.

These great middleweights boxed
six sensational rounds at Philadelphia
on Wednesday night. According to
the accounts O'Brien had a lead for
four rounds, which he lost, and then
had difficulty in staying the limit.
These are the trickiest men in ! the
ring, and they stand out above all
others, in their class. As" both have
been anxious to fight here it is thought
the Yosemite Club can bring them to
gether next month. A twenty round
bout would result in one or the other,
winning decisively and thus settling
the championship title.
Manager Coffroth of the Yosemite
Athletic Club wired to various places
in the East last night in an endeavor
to secure a match between Tommy
Ryan and Jack O'Brien.

In what betting was done last night
Hanlon was a 1 to 2 choice. At thesÂ»
odds Broad had a fair following.
If Hanlon wins he will leave here for
the East on Monday, accompanied by
his brother and by Harry Foley. Han
lon wants to visit his former manager
Mike Short, and Incidentally will nil
boxing engagements in the principal
cities.
Hanlon and Broad have both worked
wonders in their physical condition in
the short time at their disposal. Both
devoted themselves yesterday to light,
fast work indoors, but each took a long
Jaunt on the road. As there is no
specified weight to make they will be
able to rÂ«st to-day from work. Hanlon
expects to weigh 132 pounds, while
Broad, who is built on light lines, will
weigh not more than 130 pounds. Han
lon is expected to show an entirely dif
ferent style of fighting to his former
method.
Gregrgalns. who is manager of the
club promoting the fight, was then s^ni
for and he communicated with Broad
by telephone. After a short discussion
lit turned to Dan Hanlon and asked if
Hanlon would accept him- for refere?.
When Hanlon replied in the affirmative
Greg&ains announced that he would
referee the fleht.
Alex Greggains will referee the fight
between Eddie Hanlon and Kid Broad
to-night in Mechanics' Pavilion. Eddie
Smith of Oakland is the official referee
of the San Francisco Athletic Club, but
he was not acceptable to Broad.
The latter received insiructions yes
terday from Parson Davies, his man
agerd, who is in New Orleans, to hold
out for Eddie (iraney. Broad was rep
resented at a conference last niRht at
Cerbett's by Tim McGrath, while Dan
Hanlon was present in the interest of
his brother. McGrath opened the dis
cussion by saying he was told by Broad
that Graney was the only man wlvj
would suit him. Hanlon said either
Smith or Graney would be acceptable
to the Californian.

ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
One day last spring near the close
of the meeting the Petaluma horse
Whiskers was played for a "killing"
and came home. R. Wilson performed
on him not many days ago and gath
ered nothing. In the third race yes
terday'Bell had the mount on the geld
ing and landed him first at odds of 4%
to 1, nearly a length before Matt Ho
gan. Whiskers was apparently much
the best, for he came rrom quite a
piece back. The Pride finished third.
Piekaway, the favorite, showed little
speed. â¢ â¢
Larsen is assuredly not riding at his
best. He had the mount on I Know,
the 4 to 5 fayorite for the mile and
seventy yards event and finished third.
I Know, it is claimed, can step a mile
in 1:39, and instead of going on and
opening- up a length or two of daylight
over his field Larsen waited along with
the 15 to 1 shot The Fretter. At the
finish Caronal, a 12 to 1 shot piloted
by Stuart, ran over the two pace
makers, winning by more than two
lengths. The Fretter led the favorite
out a head for the place. Horton ran
fourth. [ He could have won if not
pocketed on the rail the last sixteenth.
A favorite at last was adorned with
a set of brackets, Jockey Club, a 4 to 5
chance, capturing the concluding mile
purseaffair. Tommy Burnrf again rode
"Butch" Fisher's horse, and after cut
ting out all the pace beat Stilicho a
neck, driving, hard. Gorgalette ran a
fair third.' 7Â« r
WHISKERS FOOLS, TALENT.
It will take the backers of short
priced horses two or three days to get
the kinks out of their spinal vertebrae,
for the first five favorites went down
for the count. Tommy Burns on Jock
ey Club finally came to their rescue,
taking the final event with the Fisher
entry at odds of 9 to 10. The attend
ance was larffe.
Beqause of Hildebrand having the
mount more than anything else, and
reported fast work besides, Argot was
installed favorite for the opening
event, with a field of fourteen starting.
It the mare Is fast she failed to show
anything on this particular occasion.
The winner turned up in Benlash, the
second choice, which, with Kunz up,
nosed out the 15 to 1 shot, Emma Reu
bold. Steph, a 60 to 1 shot,- finished
third, only a neck farther away.
Instructor, the 6 to 5 favorite for the
three-year-old number at seven fur
longs, showed to be a poor betting,
proposition and will be given the drift
by bettors in future. Thfe colt was out
footed by Young Pepper during the
early stages of the running and, after
trying to run out on the turns, finished
third. Johnny Daly waited in third
position with Celebrant to the stretch,
where he slipped through on the rail,
scoring- easily from Kleinwood, an 8 to
1' chance. â¢
FIVE FAVORITES LOSE.
Sad Sam, the "idol of the bushes,"
was given another strong cup of tea
to swallow yesterday at Oakland. He
was introduced to Double Six, the fast
daughter of Domino and Gloaming,
owned by the New York turfman, Jack
Follansbee, for the first time this sea
son, in a. five and a half furlong brush.
So. well thought of was Sad Sam by
the populace, and bookmakers as well,
that his market price was 7 to 10, and
buyers there were in plenty. *
Sam did not get his usual catapault
start, and Double. Six was always
within talking distance of him. Lar
sen shook the latter horse up in the
run to the stand, and, gradually wear

J.ORD MAYOR'S HKOTIIER
UNCLAIMED IN MORGUE
In the course of the couple's asso
ciation, she says, she pawned a gold
watch, which she had originally bought
for the man. Then she tried to leave
him and on the strength of the docu
mentary proof he possessed in the way
of a pawn ticket he secured a warrant
for her arrest on a larceny charge. The
man was in Judge Slogan's court to
testify against the woman who had left
all for his sake and eyed her malevo
lently during the hearing. Her state
ment of the facts was so convincing
that the Judge was impressed with her
sincerity and she will probably be dis
charged at the next hearing.
Mile. May Wilson, a wayfarer on the
crimson, path, has found the thorns on
the trail. She is charged with, grand
larceny by a man for whflm she claims
to have left a good husband and a
well-supplfed home. For more than a
year, she told Judge Mogan, she had
tried to leave the man who led her
astray in order that she might lead an
honest life.
Just about the time that Maurice
Kauffmann was trying to beat a queen
full with a pair of sevens in a friendly
poker game in the rear of his barber
shop at 1040 Folsom street Wednes
day ntght the police broke in. They
secured six > other players, a deck of
cards, eighteen stacks of vari-colored
chips and $3 20 in money. It must have
been a hat game â one of those fast
plays that gamblers know as a San
Bernardino limit.
All of the reckless gamesters were
before Judge Mogan yesterday and were
dismissed, because there was no evi
dence against them to show that the
premises were publicly used as a gam
bling house. Th" Judge stated that the
defendants had as much right to in
dulge in a poker game among them
selves as the visitors to any; pri
vate residence. Under a time honored
and somewhat battered decision of ex-
Justice Garoutte of the Supreme Court,
poker i3 not a game of chance, but one
of skill.
William Pierson interfered and Tson
vas' brother pulled a revolver and shot
at him. For some unaccountable rea
son the bullet c-nly penetrated the
clothing of the man and made a bruise
on his body. He was hurried to the
Central Emergency Hospital, where the
doctors examined the wound and or
dered the patient to a tailor shop.
Only a portion of the testimony was
heard yesterday, and the case was con
tinued until to-dav.
Strenuosity is the only redeeming fea
ture in the waiterial career of A. Tson
vas. as far as it was revealed in Judge
Conlan's court yesterday. He was ac
cused of assault with a deadly weapon,
and the main exhibit of the prosecu
tion was the badly battered head of
an iron mo-ider named George Hansen.
who wore a tightly wrapped pall of
black over the injuries he had received
from the defendant.
According to the testimony. Hansen
and two other men, in company with
three young women, entered a restau
rant on Market street, opposite Eighth,
after attending a dance, and ordered
three whiskies and three beers. Pre
sumably the men drank the whiskies
ar.d thÂ» women the beers. It is hard
lj relevant to the inquiry to probe into
this collateral matter. Horace adjured
all youths and maidens to worship
Apollo, but they chose Bacchus instead
and paid a penalty.
Tsonvas was the Ganymede, and he
also brought some sandwiches, which
the party had net ordered. When they
went to the cashier's desk to settle the
score Hansen laid down 50 cents in
payment on the sound basis of 10 cents
apiece for the whiskies and 5 cents
apiece for the beers, a total of 45 cents.
The strenuous waiter disputed the ac
count and asked for 95 onts in pay
ment. When this was refused he se
cured a club and in peeking to enforce
payment nearly beat the head off Han
sen.
tody, appeared before Judge Mogan
yesterday on the charge of perjury.
There was no complaint against him
and unless the District Attorney takes
some action Judge Conlan will have to
appear as a prosecuting witness in the
case. The defendant was ordered back
to jail until a complaint can be pre
pared.
Disheartened by poverty, and having
the example of her daughler before her
eyes, Mrs. S. A. West committed sui
cide last Wednesday night at 313 Turk
street by turning on the gas. Nicoli
Olsen, who occupied an adjoining
apartment, was sickened by the gas
that leaked into his room, but was res
cued.
Henry Bowman, the landlord, detects
ed the odor of gas coming from Mrs.
West's room at 8 o'clock yesterday
morning. The door was unlocked and
he entered and found the old lady dead
in her bed. The key of the gas fixture
was wide open. On .the dresser Avere
two notes written by the woman. One
of them read: "My clothes that I want
to be cremated in are at Mrs. Prall's.
52S EHis street." On the other was:
"Fred H. Xeergaard. 1616 Point Lobos
avenue. * Send my body here. All is
paid for it. to be cremated by Porter &
White."
The landlord, suspecting that con
siderable gas must have leaked through
the keyhole and crevices int<,> the room
occupied by Olsen. forced an entrance
and had much difficulty in restoring
him to consciousness. Olsen said" that
he went to his room at 6 o'clock in the
morning and smelled gas as he passed
Mrs. West's door, but did not pay any
attention to it.
Porter & White say that Mrs. West
came to their undertaking parlors a
few days ago with a certificate of cre
mation, but that she did not pay them
anything toward her funeral expenses.
Her talk gave them the impression that
she was mentally deranged.
On August 27, 1901, Eulalie Grace
Perkins, a daughter of Mrs. West,
killed herself in the Maison Alladio, on
Geary street, by taking cyanide of po
tassium. She had previously made the
necessary arrangements with Porter &
White for her funeral.
Mrs- West's husband was J. W. West,
who conducted the "Original Log Cabin
Candy Store" at 131C Market street. He
died a few years ago.

and was 65 years old.
Commissioner Filcher says that he
spoke about the university to the
Governor. There was no need to in
form the latter what had happened,
for he was already, familiar with the
facts. It was developed* at the inter
view that while the $180,000 was prac
tically all apportioned there was still
a reserve to draw upon. " Governor
Pardee telegraphed to President
Wheeler and requested him to call on
Commissioner Filcher in this city, v A
conference took place and an under

Wheeler should carefully go over the
matter of making a university exhibit

After the California commission had
informed President Wheeler that no
money had been reserved for the State
University out of the $130,000 appro
priated by the State Legislature there
was much talk In the University Club
and elsewhere. In fact the denial of
aid was the frequent topic of conver
sation whenever university men met.
Governor Pardee is a member of the
California Commission, ex-officio. Last
week Commissioner Filcher had occa
sion to go to Sacramento to talk about
California exhibits with the Governor.
The latter brought up the matter of
the university and insisted that some
thing should be done to give recogni
tion to the university.
â¢; Â¦Â¦:"Â¦ -FILCHER GIVES HIS AID.
When it was finally announced that
thai space was available a meeting of
the .university committee was held at
Berkeley to arrange for making a fine
exhibition and it was developed- at that
meeting that the university had much
that could be placed before, the millions
of visitors to the exposition with benefit
to the. university and with great credit
to the State of California, by which !t
is supported. At that time there was
no doubt in the minda of the university
people that the California commission
ers would second the efforts of the uni
versity by making the cecessary ap
propriation to collect ann install thj
appropriate exhibition material.
Governor Pardee, who is an alumnus
of the University of California, is de
termined that the chief educational in
stitution of the State shall receive some
assistance from the California com
missioners to make an appropriate dis
play at St. Louis in the exposition
space recently secured in the education
building. Not long ago, in response
to a letter from President Wheeler re
questing that the California commission
should appropriate $5000 for the col
lection and installation of the exhibits
of the University of California the com
missioners returned word that there
was no money available, that it had
all been appropriated. Coupled with
this statement was an expression of re
gret, but that did not nelp matters.
The university was turned down and
left to its own devices. The Board of
Regents had already refused to ap
propriate $5000. The last visible means,
short of passing the hat among the
graduates of the State university to
get the needed funds, had failed.
When the facts were published in The
Call there was a great stir among the
faculty and the graduate and student
bodies of the university. To make. the
situation the more aggravating the
space that had been secured in the
education building in St. Louis was
conspicuously solicited only when ail
the proper university space had already
been given out by the St. Louis Ex
position .management and it was pro
cured only, at the end of a long strug
gle, in which President Wheeler and
Professor Christy of the mining depart
ment of the university took a promi
nent part.
PLENTY OF MATERIAL.
Bel", alleges further tha the -.-ill was
not signed by Mrs. PU-asant and that
if she did sign it she affixed hcs. signa
ture while she was under th- Influence
of Lawyer Sherwootl and his wife, the
devisees under the will.
; ill in the presence of Mrs. Pleasant
nor in the presence of each other as the
law provides. He also alleges that the
contested document is not t: - last will
of Mrs. Pleasant.
In his contest Bell does not make
clear what his interests in the estata
of the late Mr?. Pleasant are. He sim
ply states that he has an interest and
by reason of such opposes the admit
tance of the document to probate. He
alleges that at the time the will was
made, seven days before the death of
Mrs. Pleasant, she wa3 not of sound
and --sposing mind, and ' rther that it
wa3 not a properly attested document.
He chr - es that .the witnesses to thj
will did not sign the doculnent at the
request of the testatrix and that their
signatures were not attached to tha
Frederick T. Bell, son of Theresa and
the late Thomas Bell, with which
couple the late Mary E. ('"Mammy")
Pleasant lived for a number of years,
filed a contest of the will of Mrs.
Pleasant yesterday. He claims to have
â¢"some interest in the estate," and
makes the charge that the
last testament of the aged
colored woman was not a prop
erly executed document and that
at the time it was made she was under
the influence of L. M. and Olive E. E.
Sherwood, with whom she was living at
the time she .lied and to whom she de
vised her entire estate.
A party of the owners of the flocks
returned from an inspection trip to the
island to-day and reported that unless
it rains boos there will not be a sheep
left of the many thousands with which
tnr island is stocked. An effort will be
n:Â«ide &g remove a portion of them to
the. mainland, but that task will be so
riov*' tiiat comparatively few of the
eheep will be saved.
Th<> island is one Â«~>f the group, chief
of whirh is Santa Oatalina. It lies
fiiirty-Eix miles off the coast and is
fcnrren and desolate except, in places
where there are springs. These
epriacs have dried up this season and
the Fheep which at best have scanty
feed found nothing upon which to
graze. After the water gave out the
animals began dying by hundreds.
L^S ANGELES, Jan. :'8.-As a re-
FUlt rif the drought several thousand
head of Bheep are famishing on San
Clemente Island and it is certain that
many of them will die despite the ef
forts of their owners to save them.

Kratz was vice president of the
Donandt-Kratz Company, commission
merchants, SOS Washington street, W.
P. D. Donandt having been the presi
dent. It is alleged that on February 13
last Kratz collected $16,542 75 from cus
tomers of the company. He called at
the office that evening, while Max Frey,
the bookkeeper, was there alone. - He
was accompanied by his brother, A. A.
Kratz.
William placed a bag containing
money on Frey's desk and asked him
to make certain entries in the ca:>h
book from a list he held in his hand.
Frey refused and "William made the
entries in the book himself, the total
amounting to $16,542 75. William then
gave his brother the bag containing
the money and when Frey asked him
what he intended doing with the cash
he Veplied, "I gave it to my brother
and have got his receipt for It." Both
brothers stepped into a buggy, which
v.as in front of the store, and drove
away.
A~. A. Kratz was arrested the follow
ing day in this city, but no trace of
William was discovered for several
days, when the police learned that he
was in Kansas City, living under th2
name of William Knutson. He was ar
rested there and brought back here by
Detective T. B. Gibson. All the money
he had in his possession was $S5. Both
brothers were held to answer by Police
Judge Fritz.
The Donandt-Kratz Company had to
go through bankruptcy.
A jury was impaneled in Judere
Dunne's court yesterday to try the
case of William M. Kratz, charged with
felony embezzlement. The jury is com
posed of AV. G. Hughes, M. Ahern, W.
X. French. H. Ehrlich, W. J. Gerrard,
William Bloch. Martin Keating. F. M.
Rust, J. XV. S. Bailey, John M. Loane,
H. Schroder and Martin Hester. The
case was continued Monday morn
ing at the request of Attorney W. S.
Barnes, who said he had just been re
tained by the defendant and wanted
time to familiaiize himself with the
facts. Assistant District Attorney
Whiting represents the people.

There were seven youngsters before
Judge 1 ritz yesterday on the charge of
throwing rocks on Stoneman street.
When one comes to look at the name
the suggestive theory sticks out like a
Bore thumb. Any kid who lives on
Stoneman street and doesn't throw
rocks must be backward in intellect.
All of the boys were booked for com
mitment to a public institution, but
the parents were in court with prom
ises of good behavior and the youths
were let go.
Nicholas Pastene, the "Un-memorial
Kid.' who testified in the case of the
alleged murder of Vincenso LavagnJno
and lied so abundantly before Judge
Conlan \' -t he \va3 ordered into cus-
the amount of money that will be
needed.
President Wheeler admitted that he
did not know just what would be re
quired, so Commissioner Filcher says.
The Commissioner also says that $1000
ought to pay for collecting and ' in
stalling the university- exhibit at St.
Louis, considering 1 the California Com
mission' will pay the freight upon* all
exhibits. The outcome of the inter
view between Governor ' Pardee and
Commissioner Filcher will probably be
satisfactory to the university men. who
were willing that the products of the
soil should be well represented, but
also entertained the idea that the
State's chief educational institution
was also worthy to be shown as repre
sentative of .California.

The army transport Dix, Captain
George Ankers, the big. black hulled
freighter of the quartermaster's depart
ment, arrived yesterday from Manila.
In a few days she will be ready to take
on board whatever of military stores
and supplies the authorities elect to
pack in her capacious holds for trans
portation to the Philippines. The Dix,
formerly the Samoa, is a sister to the
Pacific Mail Company's Algoa and is
one of the largest carriers c-n the Pa
cific ,.
After a little necessary overhauling
the Dix will go from here to Portland,
where a large shipment of hay and
oats is awaiting her. She will return
from the Oregon port and here fill up
to the limit -of her remaining capacity
with horses and mules.
The Dix has no passenger accommo
dations, but brought from the Orient
two discharged soldiers who have been
serving with the legation guard at Pe
king ond who missed the transport
Sheridan. The passengers were L-.
Charles and O. Engold. The Dix came
home in ballast, but brought a ship
ment of bamboo poles to be used in
the construction of the -Philippine ex
hibit at St. Louis. The Dix also brought
a Filipino casco, which will be taken
to St. Louis on the deck of two flat
cars.
This casco, type of lighter familiar
in the Far East, is something of a
marine curiosity in these "s\ T aters. -,It
Is about 75 feet long and 11 feet in
beam. When in commission heavy
bamboo outriggers prevent its capsiz
ing. The casco is built of hardwood
and weighs about fifteen tons.
The Dix has a cargo capacity of 13,000
tons- measurement. On her outward
voyage her cargo included 36,000 sacks
of oats. 6000 bales of hay and 3,300,000
feet of lumber. The Dix left Manila
38 days ago and was 23% days coming
from Nagasaki.

Two more cars of Western Poultry were
marketed, making five for the week, includ
ing one which came in on Saturday. A third
car came in le.to In the day, but was not
placed on sale. Th^ market was decidedly
weak, and Western Hens and Roosters moved
off sloviy at $ti@U 50 per dozen. Local stock
arrived, freely and was weak, owing to the
liberal arrivals of Western. Toung Roosters,
Fryers and Broilers were quoted lower.
Dres*ed Turkeys were dull, with receipts too
heavy for the market to absorb. About 75
cases came in and prices had a wide range

NEW ORLEANS. Jan. 2b.â The bull leaders
swei t the ring off it? feet in the cottcn markn
to-day. With frenzied coverings by ehorta
March was sent above the lti-cent mnrk to
IC 20c. The market opened excited on fav
orinp cables from Liverpool. A fair amount
of general buying orders were eeen, but late
In the morning the bull leadf-rs offered to take
all the May cotton the ring had at 10.33c.
The. purchases amounted to about 5000 bales.
The ring was practically bare cf offerings
after this= and prices quickly rose until March
was-3Â» points higher than yesterday's clcee
at lÂ«.02c and May was 45 points higher
at 10.53c.
NEW ORLEANS
The opening advances had been into new
high srrounl, Furopeens were buying heavily
here, the local bull leader was openly support
ing the market, whatever he may have been
doing private.'y. and outside demand seemed
bigger than since last Tuesday. At any rate,
with only slight concessions, the market was
worked stocdily upward until shortly after
midday. May reached lG.15c at noon. This
uncovered f-iop-lose orders and the market de
veloped into the wildest excitement so far
noted. In one Jumn July went from 16.25c to
lÂ«.40c. while Ma>i sold up to liS.SOc. The act
ive months at this level were net 40 to 83
points higher for the day and gcored a net ad
vance from the low point of last week of
about 2'4 efflts. Such a gain as this naturally
attracted Jieavy realizing and with demands
1Â»bs pressing there was a quick reaction of
abcut 20 to 30 points, which, however, was
followed by renewed steadiness as the bulls
apaln came to the support of the market.
Sales were estimated at 1. 500.000 bales.
NEW YORK. Jan. JS. â The cotton market
from the start ruled exceedingly firm and
active on higher cables, light estimated re
ceipts and further reports o? a growing scarci
ty cf spot c-ottcn In the South, accompanied by
the most bullish gossip concerning the specula
tive situation.
Eastern Cotton Market.
Salinas and river Burbank Potatoes con
tinued to meet with a steady local inquiry and
ruled firm under moderate supplies. Trade in
Oregon Burbanks was less active, the high

threat May quickly advanced to SOSic. There:
was renewed selling by .locals on the upturn,
and with- a lot up in the demand the price
gradually declined to S9c. The sentiment
improved later in the day on . the strength of
the cash article at Minneapolis and on con
firmation of rain in. Argentina. A prominent,
commission house had a private dispatch from '
London which stated that the war cloud was
again assuming alarming proportions. A de
cline in the price of New York stocks caused
60me traders to give credence to this report,
and buying orders were more in evidence dur
ing the past part of the sereion. From 89c May
slowly moved upward until it had reached
90 Vic. Realizing sales late In the day caused
a decline cf Vic but the close was firm at
SOvÂ»c. a gain of ViÂ£t-%c over yesterday's final
figures. The speculative demand for the July
option showed some increase. After ranging
between 61J46S2itc that month closed VjS%c
higher at *2%c. Fears of damage to the
growing' crop' by the I extreme cold -weather
was. a. factor in influencing prices of that de
livery.
' The corn market was influenced ' mainly by
the action of wheat. . The close in specula
tive trading was firm, with May at 49%c.
The opening was a shade lower to a shade
higher at 49tic to â¢*9%c, and prices ranged be
tween 40%c and 49*4c. , Local receipts were
184 cars, cno of contract grade.
Oats followed other grains, fluctuating with
in a narrow range and closing about un
changed from yesterday. May opened un

Discuss Gas Fixtures.
The Light Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met last night to consider
the proposed ordinance regulating the
size and style of grv pipes and fixtures.
It was addressed by J. L. E. Firmin,
representing the master plumbers, and
Vanderlynn Stow, representing the gas
fixture men. , Both speakers urged that
the resolution be altered and that the
time of its going into effect be post
poned until the dealers get rid of their
present stocks, j It was also suggested
that an inspector under the direction of
the Board of Public Wr-kF be employed
to see. that fixtures' in public buildings
are in safe condition. The matter will
be further considered at a later date.

A suit involving the control of the
Mount Jefferson Mines, Consolidated,
was filed with the County Clerk yester
day. It is an action for the appointment
of a receiver to take charge of the mines
pending a trial of*the suit, which is
based on the charge that the directors
of the concern have by fraudulent and
unlawful means appropriated the
funds of the concern to their own use
and have deliberately carried out a
scheme to defraud the stockholders.
The plaintiffs in the action are James
Meighnn, a director of the corporation,
and Thomas Conncll and John J.
Bench, stockholders. The defendants
are C F. Humphrey, J. J. Meyers. C.
H. Hilbert, Â»B. Goodwin, W. II. Fraser,
H. A; Jlorin, Guy H. Salisbury and A.
L. Wisner, a Xew York banker and
broker.
According to the complaint the
company, which controls one of the
oldest groups of mines in Tuolumne
County, was incorporated under the
laws of the Territory of Arizona in
December, 1902. Meighan. one of the
plaintiffs, was elected a director â he
owns 135,115 shares of stock â and so
were Defendants Humphrey, Meyers,
Hilbert and Goodwin. This board of
directors managed the affairs of the
company until August. 1903, when
Humphrej-, Hilbert, Goodwin and
Meyers resigned and theirv places on
the directorate were taken by Fraser,
Morin, Salisbury and J. P. Water
house. The last named served until
January 8 of this year, when he re
signed, and A. L. Wisner, a New York
banker, was elected in his stead.
These changes, say the plaintiffs,
were part of a well laid scheme to de
fraud the company and its stockhold- 1
ers, though the existence of the al
leged conspiracy did not become evi
dent until recently. Meighan now
claims he is in possession of informa
tion that shows Humphreys, Hilbert,
Goodwin and Meyers entered into a
conspiracy to defraud the concern and
the people who owned its stock, and
caused to be selected in their stead as
directors men who would be as pup
pets in their hands and obey their
every behest to so handle the affairs
of the concern that they and not the
corporation* would reap the benefit.
The complaint resolves itself into a
charge that Humphrey nnd the other
defendants have appropriated to their
own use more than $100,000 belonging to
the corporation. The plaintiffs allege
that of the $175,000 received by the de
fendants from the sale of stock and
bullion taken from the ndnes have
expended only $75,000 honestly, thus
creating a fund of $100,000 which re
mains unaccounted for.
The complainant asks the court to
appoint a receiver to take charge of
the affairs of the corporation pending
the determination of the truth of their
charges; for an accounting of the ac
tions of the defendants since the for
mation of the corporation; for an in
junction restraining the defendants
from carrying out their alleged nefa
rious schemes and for an order remov
ing the alleged dummy directors, Fra
ser. Morin, Salisbury and Wisner.
Humphreys in an interview last
night said: "Knight, McLaren &

Servians Honor Patriot.
The twenty-fourth anniversary and
banquet of the Servian-Montenegrin
Literary and Benevolent Society was
given in honor of the great Servian pa
triot, San Sava, at Lodge Hall, 1605
Polk street, last Wednesday evening.
A large audience attended and appreci
ated an interesting programme. San
Sava was born in the twelfth century
and was the youngest son of Stevan
Nemanja who united the Servians in
their first kingdom. He also success
fully placed the church of the Balkans
on a sound foundation.
before January 27, and should travel
southward at the rate of fifty miles an
hour and drop the money off when the
red. light was sighted. The idea of a
light engine going fifty miles an hour
for an unusually long distance, over a
road on which were being operated
numerous trains, and sighting a small
r6d light through possible mist and
rain, appealed to the railroad officials
as one coming from a person not thor
oughly acquainted with railroading.
MEN UNDER SURVEILLANCE.
It was at this stage of the affair,
when the officials of the road were be
ginning to be greatly concerned in their
correspondent, that the Pinkerton rep
resentative suggested the plan of an
swering the anonymous writer througli
the- daily papers of this city, the idea
hi ing to draw out more correspondence
from him and have the postonjees in
and about Fresno carefully watched
with a view to detecting the author.
The plan was successful in so far as
more letters were concerned, for an
other was received from Fresno, where,
however, it was dropped into the mail
box without its sender being detected.
It nevertheless led the detectives to
the conclusion that their man was liv
ing and operating somewhere between
Madera and Tulare and the bands of
sleuths were concentrated in that ter
ritory and were busy on the scent wh;n
the story gained publicity yesterday.
Captain B. F. Kemble, resident super
intendent of the Pinkerton agency,
when seen yesterday afternoon, was
not inclined to enter fully into a dis
cussion of the affair, but he remarked
with an air of satisfaction:
"We are convinced that we have un
der surveillance the man who is guilty
of the letter writing and we are also
trailing four of his chums. Two of them
arc 'dope fiends' and the man suspected
of writing the threatening letters is a
rather 'weak fellow. 1 am convinced
that if one of our men should take the
fellow by the neck and give him a good
booting he would never be seen around
a railroad track again. In other words,
w(- do not think he has the courage to
v::t(.k a train, but simply wrote these
letters, hoping that the railroad offi
cials would readily yield to his demands
and he would get away with a bag of
gold. Certainly if these men had de
cided to carry out their threat they
have probably abandoned it now in
RAISES HIS DEMAND.
land trains dynamited.
It was stated yesterday that this
was the original theory of the Pinker
ton representative when he was first
called into the case and was later
shared by General Manager Krutt
schnitt. The poorly composed mes
sages received from Fresno by the rail
road authorities showed beyond . a
doubt that a man of ignorance wrote
them and that his ignorance extended
to railroad operations, thus conveying
the idea that he was not a railroad
man or one experienced in the crim
inal art of railroad robbery.
The story of the demands made on
the Southern Pacific Company was
given out at the local offices of the
company yesterday, with interesting
details. The first letter received by
the company, more than a month ago,
contained a demand for $10,000. It stip
ulated that the amount in gold should
be. dropped off at night at a point on
the San Joaquin division to be desig
nated by a red light which the writer
place near the track. In order
that the fact that the company had re
ceived his letter and was prepared to
meet hi? demand should be promptly
conveyed to him. the writer insisted
that the trains on the San Joaquin
division should fly white flags on their
engines for six days. Failure to com
ply with these demands, the letter
fetated, would be followed immediately
by a communication to the daily paper*
of San Francisco warning the public
against patronizing the company's
trains, which the writer and his pals
would attempt to blow ud. Little heed
was paid to the letter, for many of a
similar character are received by the
officials of the railroad company, but
when a second, in the same disguised
handwriting, was forwarded to General
Manager Kruttschnitt. his anxiety was
suddenly aroused and the services of
the Pinkertons and the railroad detec
tives were at once called for. The* sec
ond letter raised the original demand
of $10,000 to $15,000, and boldly informed
the company that the writer was in
earnest and would wreck the trains un
less the money was immediately sent
to him.
In this letter the writer demanded
that a light engine, carrying the gold,
should leave Stockton at night, on ur

and his attorney with a copy of the
experts* report and asked them to ex
amine tho books 'and vouchers, which
they declined to do."
The anxiety of General Manager
Krutlschnitt and his assistants of the
Southern Pacific Company over the
threats tc wreck trains unless money
v as put in the hands of the writer of
Ine threats was noticeably diminished
yesterday. Though the blackmailer had
,:ixr* the Â£7th as the day upon which
his grim work would begin if the money
vas not forthcoming, that day and yes
terday passed without any attempt to
Mow up trains. Wednesday and the
right following were an anxious day
and night for the officials of the com
pany. The failure to comply with the
instructions to have money dropped at
fjmo convenient point along the San
Joaquin division would, it was natur
ally expected, be accepted by the black
mailer as a defiance of his threats, and,
if he possessed the determination sug
jvstcd In his bold letters, fear was en
tertained that he might attempt his
work of destruction. But the day and
llighL passed without incident along the
load and yesterday also went by with
out further word from the mysterious
Flrangcr or physical evidence of any
ill-tempor on his part.
It v..as learned from the railroad of
ficials yesterday that the blackmailer
in th 1 ? second letter he wrote raised his
oVmand from $10,000 to Sir.,000. The first
'letter was written in December.
At the hour of closing of the railroad
Â«>t!ices yesterday afternoon Manager
Kruttschnitt said he no longer had rea-
F'in to fear trouble from his unknown
southern correspondent and that the
leports received by him during the day
from the Pinkerton and his own de-
Lccilvcs had wholly satisfied him that
the theory originally advanced by the
J'inkcrton representative in this oity
-ihat the author of the threatening let
ters was only running a bluff was the
correct one. Nevertheless, added the
jrenera! manager, every precaution was
being; taken to protect life and property
nnd tho detectives, would not be re
itCVfd from their work until the com
pany had more fully satisfied itself that
the further patrolling of the railroad
lines was unnecessary.
DISCIPLE OP GRATErXE.
While undoubtedly pleased over the
situation. General Manager Krutt
t-thnilt could not conceal his chagrin
Â«>vcr th<- sudden exposure of the affair,
v. hich. of course, means that the plans
for the arrest of the letter writer have
been destroyed after the company had
employed the best detective talent in
the West and spent considerable mon
**>â¢ to bring abci|t his capture. Thirty
â¢ lays of investigation of the case, it is
nÂ«Â»w claimed by the railroad officials,
has resulted in thÂ« obtaining of evi-
Asnce which thoroughly satisfies them
liiK. the threatening letters, mailed in
Fresno, were written by some one fa
miliar with that section of the State,
whose plans for blackmailing the
Southern Pacific Company had their
origin in the sensational stories of the
kidnaping of Millionaire Cudahy's son
by tho notorious Pat Crowe and the
subsequent attempt of Gravelle of
Montana to force the Great Northern
JTalJmad to accede to his demand for
$jO,O00 under penalty of having over-
view of the knowledge they have that
the tracks are being patrolled by de
tectives."
THREATENS SANTA FE.
Captain Kemble. however, added
that, notwithstanding the accepted
theory of the detectives and the rail
road officials, they had both agreed
that it is the railroad company's duty
to adopt every precautionary means to
prevent a plan to wreck a train being
undertaken, and for that reason the de
tective force in the Fresno vicinity is
not being diminished or allowed to re
lax its vigilance. There are many, and
not a few of them are railroad officials,
one in particular being Division Super
intendent Burkhalter, . who have not
readily accepted the theory of the de
tectives and are inclined to believe that
there is really^ a plot on foot in Fresno
to force the Southern Pacific Company
to give up a big sum Of money or suf
fer the loss of property, with possible
loss of life. The country in that sec
tion of the State is known to be filled
with desperate criminals, driven west
ward by the severe Eastern winter.
While the men whom the detectives
claim to have under surveillance may be
lacking the" requisite daring to blow up
a train, there are many who think that
probably they are but the tools of a
more dangerous set of criminals, who
are only awaiting a chance to derail,a
train and show the company the folly
of having tried to rifle with them.
A dispatch from Fresno yesterday
stated that letters similar to those sent
to the Southern Pacific Company were
received by the officials of the Santa
Fe road several weeks ago and that
the. matter had since heen under in
vestigation by the detectives of that
corporation, who had been trailing men
as far north as this city. When asked
yesterday regarding this story Assist
ant Traffic Manager W. A. Kisseli said
he had heard nothing of it. At the
Southern Pacific Company's building,
however, the story was common talk,
and it was claimed that the detectives
of that company, while working on the
express car robbery at San Luis Obispo,
had met Santa Fe agents who had con
fided to thorn the facts, and the South
erji Pacific detectives had reported the
matter to their superiors in this city.
A report received here yesterday to
the effect that a farmer's boy had
found dynamite near the Calwa win
ery, which is located a short distance
from the scene of the recent Velta
wreck, was pronounced last night by
Captain Kemble of the Pinkerton
agency to be untrue. The day after
the Volta wreck a boy found what he
supposed to be a stick of dynamite near
that place and carried it home to his
father, who later reported the matter
to the detectives. An investigation by
the latter, however, developed the fact
that the supposed dynamite was a
burned out "fusee," which all trains
are compelled to carry and use to
signal to trains following them. Sev
eral of these "fusees" have since been
found in the neighborhood of the Volta
wreck. Â¦

Special Dispatch to The Call
SAX LUIS OB1SPO, Jan. 28.â The
crowd that filled the office of Justice
of the Peaco J. 1^ Eddy to-day when
the preliminary hearing of "John Doe,"
the alleged train robber was called,
was so large that the second-story
floor in the Robasciotti building, in
which the office is located, commenced
to give way. It being deemed unsafe
to continue the proceedings in that
room an adjournment was at once
taken to th*Â» Superior Court room in
the County Courthouse.
Eight out of a probable fifteen or
twenty witnesses for the prosecution
wore examined. It was during the ex
amination of the first witness, Engineer
G. K. Wilson of the * helper engine,
which hauled the first section of No. 9
over the Cuesta grade on the night of
January 20 that Attorney A. E. Camp
bell for the defense stated positively
that he'would prove that the defendant
was in Santa Barbara at the time the
witness Wilson stated that he saw him
on the platform at the San Luis Obispo
station. The defense has had no wit
nesses on the stand as yet to prove
this assertion. Wilson stated positively
that the defendant was the man he
saw on the depot platform when wait
ing to leave at 10:40.
Conductor K. H. Meyers of the sec
ond section of No. 9 next testified and
said that he saw the defendant on the
platform at 11:40 just before his train
pulled out. Meyers was positive, fie
also said that he saw the express car
side door open at Santa Margarita, and
that the speed of the train between
tunnels Nos. 1 and 2 was from twelve
to fifteen miles an -hour. Meyers said
that the train passed that point at
12:10. Â«
Conductor R. R. Hankenson, who
took out local freight No. 333 at 6 a.
m. told of picking up the safe at tunnel
No. 1 and delivering it to the station
agent at Santa Margarita.
James Rice, the tramp who sold the
defendant the hat, told a story of need
ing money more than he did a $4 hat
and parting with the hat. When the
officers found him hatless near the
scene of the burg)ary he was scared.
He said he had bought the hat in Ta
eoma. J. A. Dunbar identified both the
defendant and the hat. At 5 o'clock
the hearing was continued to to-mor
