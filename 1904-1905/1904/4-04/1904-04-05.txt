This afternoon each of these new
presidents was called upon to speak
and profess his loyalty to the church
und to urge all young people to remain
loyal. The greatest Interest was In the
epeech of Richard W. Young, grandson
of Brigham Young, a West Point grad
uate, -major of volunteers during the
Spanish-American war and Judge of
the Supreme Court of the Philippines
under military rule. He has not been
regarded hitherto as an especially
warm churchman. To-day he declared
his adherence to the principles of Mor
monlsm, said he could understand the
reason for some of the opposition, but
had no sympathy with the attempts to
unseat Senator Smoot on religious
grounds, overriding the constitution.
. Apostle Hyrum M. Smith, speaking
as a young man, the youngest of the
apostles, urged all of the newer gen
eration to follow In the footsteps of
their parents and not to break away
from Mormonism.
The president of the Salt Lake
"Stake" for the last twenty-eight
years has been Angus M. Cannon,
brother of the late George Q. Can
non, the "Mormon Richelieu." He is a
man of great strength, but is becom
ing old, and was accused of being out
cf sympathy with the younger element.
His two counselors, Charles W. Fen
rose and Joseph E. Taylor, are even
older than he and , both reactionary, in
their tendencies. Accordingly the
church authorities during the last two
weeks divided the Salt Lake "stake"
Into three parts and placed a compara
tively young man at the head of each
of the new stakes.
SALT LAKE. Utah, April 4.â An ar
dent appeal to young Mormons to re*
main steadfast for their church was
made to-day at the general conference
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat
.ter Day Saints at the Salt Lake Taber
nacle. Nearly all the afternoon was
taken up in the efforts to keep the
younger Mormons from breaking away.
Especially In Salt Lake City, with its
large population of Gentiles, has there
been noticed a tendency of the younger
people to drift away from the leader
thSp of the hierarchy. The leaders be
came alarmed at this tendency a short
time ago and decided upon a reorgan
ization of the Salt Lake "stake" or
diocese.

and a light pair of shackles formed a

tion received by secret service officials
that powerful 'friends of the woman

her patent-leather boots. A thick pur
ple veil concealed her features. She
wore a. tailor-made gown of rich blue
material. Four diamond rings and nu
merous single gems gave an added ap
pearance of wealth to the fair prisoner.
"I. will tell\ my story in Oregon, not
in -Chicago," she said. "These secret
service officers may, have told too much
already for their own good."
Secret service officials were plainly
in dread that Mrs. Waton would prove
their claim that. she is the '^rnost slip

HOUSTON, Texas. April 4. â X
tragedy of a peculiar nature was al
most enacted on the big strawberry
plantation south of this city to-day.
Walter Pierce, aged 14, was accused by
his companions of having stolen a
basket of luncheon. The other ' berry
pickers organized a mock court, gave
Pierce a trial, found him guilty and
fixed his punishment at death. The
sentence was that he should be im
mediately hanged.
A rope was procured and the boy was
overpowered and strung up to a tree.
His cries early, in the proceedings at
tracted attention and men arrived In
time to cut him down, alive but un^
conscious.
John Gilmore and two others who
were leaders In the attempted execution
are under arrest. There Is much In
dignation over the affair and all of the
participants are to be vigorously prose

In December, 1902, Judge Lewis and
his aged : wife, who lived on "a farm : a
few milea from Almira, . were brutally
beaten to death In their home. This
crime was not discovered for several
days. The motive presumably was rob
bery, as the house was thoroughly ran
sacked, yet when the officers reached
the scene the- small hoardof the aged
couple was found untouched.
Charles Thennis was , shot \ to Â« death
In his saloon at Govan, ? a short dis
tance from Almira, in April last. No
motive for . the crime was ever discov
ered, although there was ' talk that
Thennis ' had expressed * his opinions too
freely about the murder of -Judge
Lewis,: saying he could s find the mur
derers. For this crime Cyrus Victor
was convicted on-- circumstantial evi
dence. .
Last fall Mrs. Northrup was shot and
killed : in the same . locality' by â¢ James
"Banford. *Â¦: He was adjudged Insane by
a' Jury, -but has never been "committed

sheet and: buried only a foot below the
earth's surface, the body of E.E. Eng
lish was t found about . twenty miles
from Afmira, ' Wash., to-day, and an
other mysterious crime has been devel
oped which' seems strangely connected
with a series "of -killings which have
aroused .that town in the last three
years. No motive for the , murder of
English is apparent. By a remarkable
coincidence the finding of the body
came upon the anniversary of the
shooting of Charles Thennis near Al
mira one year ago. For. the alleged
killing Cyrus Victor has been convicted
of murder and now awaits the action
of the Supreme Court..-
It was to the brother of Cyrus Victor
that E. E. English sold his ranch in
1901 and then mysteriously disappeared.
English had never been heard from,
and Frank Victor, who bought the
ranch, said that when he last saw Eng
lish the latter was still upon the ranch.
The body was found near some springs
frequented by stockmen near the Vic
tor ranch.
When Â¦; English sold his ranch to
Frank Victor, the consideration was
51000. Prosecuting Attorney Dye mak
ing out the sale papers. It was then
reported. that English intended return
ing to his old home in England. Sheriff
Inkster says English was last seen
alive upon his ranch. The Sheriff says
he . talked to a man who ; had offered
English^ 52000 for his ranch, but was
refused. This was a year before the
sale was made to Frank Victor .and
before land had risen in value in that
section. : -.-.Â¦ '

REDDING, April 4.â As a result ot
the" exhumation or "the body ~ot
Mrs. Frank Charles, her hus
band was placed in jail this morn
ing to answer to a charge of murder.
He is alleged to have caused his wife'3
death by beating her on the ." head.
Charles is a full-blooded Indian. His
wife was a quarter-breed Indian.
Charles wooed and won her at the res
ervation in Oregon, brought her, a
young girl, to this county to reside less
than a year ago. The couple lived on
| he McCloud River, -eight miles above
Baird. The neighbors claimed that the
husband beat his wife terribly. Final
ly she died. No one but the husband
was present. He buried her last Tues
day without formality of any kind. Ab
sence of a burial permit is not un
common among the Indians here, but
the cecrecy of the burial ''aroused the
suspicions of the neighbors, who de
manded an investigation by the au
thdrities. Coroner John Bassett ex
humed the body of the woman yester
day. Dr. C. A. Monroe conducted the
post-mortem examination, which show
ed death to have been caused by three
severe blows on the head with some
blunt instrument. Deputy District At
torney James ' C. Estep, who was one
of the party, ordered the husband's ar
rest. Charles, was brought to the
County Jail this morning.
. Such has been the result of all
clews so far presented. The detec
tives acknowledge that the case is a
hard one, but they, intend to work up
every point that is brought to their
attention in the hope that it may lead
to the apprehension of the bandits.
The detectives feel confident that the
men sought , are' local people and that
this district will never ' be Â¦ free from
danger, of hold-ups 'until the men are
behind orison bars.
REDDING, April J.â The force of
detectives here at work on the Cop
ley- train Â¦ robbery case still seem 'to
be groping in the dark. They are fol
lowing up every possible clew present
ed, but each in turn Vesults in naught.
The point uncovered Sunday concern
ing the purchase of dynamite by a
stranger at Anderson six days before
the hold-up was considered good by
the detectives, but investigation show
ed that the purchaser of the dynamite
was a responsible, farmer living near
Anderson, whom the salesman did not
happen to know. The purchaser
proved to the officers that he had a
legitimate use for the explosive.
Temporary insanity is supposed to
have been the cause of- the: suicide,
as the woman's mind Â¦ has -been de
ranged for the last nine : months. The
deceased was a native" of England and
4 3 years of age. She leaves a hus
band. The inquest will be held next
Thursday. *

ANDâ OTHERS.
The better class of druggists, everywhere, are men of scientific attainments and high integrity^]
who devotfj' their lives to the welfare of their fellow men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents of known value, in" accordance with physicians* prescriptions and
scientific formula!. Druggists of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, but
always under original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the men to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-class pharmacy and the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and. remedial .appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of thebenenta
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long year3 of study and manyhours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of
Figa i isan excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine! article bearing the^full
nama of the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases of colds and headaches atUnded by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant,- prompt and beneficial in its effects as
Syrup of Figs, and they are glad to 6ell it because it gives universal satisfaction.
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and "whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in- order to make a larger profit. ' Such preparations
sometimes have the name â "Syrup of Figs"â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because .they are injurious to the system: In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig -Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has beeh.^o unfortunate as to enter hjs
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do so with other "medicinal agents, and in the filling of
physicians' prescriptions/ and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where/in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company-
California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class ot
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.The View From the Window.

ish Tibetan expedition. For instance,
the "Novoe Vremya declares Great
Britain's seizure of Tibet Is bound to
cause throuble for Russia, but it fol
lows this declaration with a significant
editorial on the falsity of sentiment
in politics, in which the point Is made
that Russian assistance to the United
States at the most critical period in
her history availed her nothing, and
that the real interests of Russia and
Great Britain now call for an under
standing.
The Novosti favors an alliance,
pointing out as a basis that Russia
wants ports on the Pacific, an opening
on the Persian Gulf and the free pas
sage of the Bosphorus, for which Rus
sia will guarantee Great Britain peace
in India.
The . Svet alone is. bitter, declaring
that Great Britain's diplomatic mission
to Tibet is unmasked, having become
one of bloodletting, showing that
Great Britain is profiting by Russia's
attention being occupied elsewhere.

but a miracle can save Russia from
humiliation and disastrous defeat at
the hands of the Japanese. Russia's
army,' navy and civil service are hon
eycombed with corruption and mutiny
to an extent utterly beyond belief. The
Trans-Siberian Railway is a complete
failure. The Japanese know to a
nicety Russia's strength in East Asia
and count upon a six years' war. They
know the Russians have no supplies
and cannot get any except by driblets
from Europe.
WASHINGTON, April 4.â Another
war canard, having for its object the
widening of the breach between Rus
sia and America, has been exploded.
Some days ago a British correspon
dent sent an account of the hauling
down of an American flag by the
Russian authorities In Newchwang and
the story was given wide circulation
in the press of Europe and this coun
try. It was followed the next day by
another to the effect that an apology
had been made to the American Con
sul in Newchwang and the flag re
hoisted with proper ceremony. '
An official of .the State Department
said to-day that Consul; Miller at
Newchwang had reported no occur
rences of the kind mentioned, but, on
the contrary, cablegrams received from
him as late as yesterday stated that
his relations with the Russian authori
ties were most cordial and that the
latter were showing great considera
tion in the treatment accorded for
eigners.
The account of the hauling down of
the flag evidently was manufactured
out of whole cloth.

Korean Declines an Ofllci
SEOUL, Korea. April 4. â Hyun
YÂ»>ng Un. who was recently appointed
Korean Minister to Japan, has de
Â»lined to accept the office.
SHANGHAI. April 4.â A letter from
Kobe, Japan, says that the, Japanese
Government has 260,000 troops in mo
tion and fully 60,000 additional' men
under arms in garrisons and depots.
This is exclusive of the third army
reserves, numbering 120,000 men, who
have not yet been called out. The
exact number of the troops which have
already departed, for certain destina
tions is unknown, but the entire first
army corps has been landed and estab
lished, in Northwestern Korea, with
Chenampho as its main base. The
general staff still carefully guards its
plan of campaign, but It Is generally
believed it will operate three armies,
nominally of 100,000 men each, the
second landing west of the Yalu River
and the third east of Xewchwang.
The latter two landings can be easily
accomplished, for light cruiser squad
rons can protect both movements. It
is believed that the landing of a heavy
force of men west of the mouth of the
Yalu will force the Russians to aban
don the fortifications which they have
been erecting north of the Yalu for
the purpose of opposing the crossing
of the first army from Korea.
It is expected that the three great
forces could then operate in conjunc
tion, the third army corps swinging
eastward from Xewchwang, seizing or
cutting the railway, then engaging in
a turning movement against the main
Russian position.
The Japanese Government is con
fident that the Russians will be unable
to transport sufficient - supplies to
maintain In Manchuria* a' force larger
than 300,000 men,' heavy detachments
of which will be necessary- to guard
the railway and bases of supply, re
ducing the fighting force to the neigh
borhood of 200,000 men.
Japan has been requisitioning thou
sands of horses and it is probable that
a considerable detachment of cavalry
will accompany each army corps. The
horses of the cavalrymen seem in
ferior, but the officers say they will
satisfactorily accomplish any work
mapped out for them.'
Much Japanese artillery is depart
ing for the front. It seems light, but
it. la believed they have a number of
heavy batteries equal In range to the
best modern field artillery. Japan also
possesses a large 1 number of excellent
mountain batteries, which In a rough
country will give them a distinct ad
vantage over the Russians in this re
spect.
It seems certain that Admiral Togo's
failure to effectively dispose of the
Russian fleet at Port Arthur has de
layed land operations. A general thaw
is now proceeding in Korea and Man
churia, which renders the roads of
both countries impassable, so that it
will be impossible to conduct active
operations until the ground hardens.
Epw'Jal Cable to The Call and New Tork Her
aJd. Co:iyrlrM. 1!XH. by the Xew Ycrk
Herald Publlshine Company.
PARIS, April 4. â A military expert
thus discusses the Far Eastern situa
tion in this morning's Paris edition of
the Herald:
"All dispatches agree in stating
that the Japanese army concentrated
toward Anju is making a movement
toward the Yalu. driving before it
weak detachments of Cossacks, who
are retiring on its approach, but keep
ing In contact with it.
"The main column, which follows
the chief road, will have occupied
without serious resistance Siengchen
and Tchyalsan and will be more than
fifty kilometers from Wiju. which is
said to have been put in a state of de-'
fense by the Russians. If credit is to
be given to news, which seems prema
ture, of a Japanese army of 105,000
men. they must have succeeded in
shipping them toward the mouth of
ihe Tavangho, in front of Takushan,
in spite of the breakers which line the
coastr and they will be already on the
march toward the northwest, striving
lo reach Xewchwang, or they must
have Joined hands with another army
of invasion that has come from the
southwest. Allowing for . the part
played by the Imagination, which
must have given birth to this strategic
conception of such great energy, it
must be admitted that the Japanese,
though they can scarcely have been
able to disembark on the east side of
Liaotung Gulf, will doubtless make an
attempt to throw one or more army
corps into the bay of Korea toward
the point where the Tayangho dis
charges itself, in order lo take in the
rear the Russian troops defending the
Yalu or to aim at Tuiyan and Hai
rheng for the purpose of marching on
Llaolo paralleled with the army of
Anju.
"The Russians will probably hold
back from accepting a decisive battle
until after they have drawn this army
upon their own chosen field near the
line of Mukden, LJaoyang and Hai
cheng. which serves as their base of
operations, and this supposition re
ceives some support from the report
that a Russian army is concentrating
exactly between these two last named
towns.
"This point really commands the
two most direct roads which ko to
ward the mouth of the Yalu and al
lows General Kuropatkin to dispose
all of his forces so as to crush any at
tempt at disembarkation toward Yin
kow and any Japanese corps that may
have succeeded in landing farther
south on the peninsula of Kwantung."
TOLSTOI GRIEVES
OVER WAR SPIRIT
OF HIS PEOPLE
PARIS, April 5.â A correspondent of
the Figaro cables an interview with
Count Tolstoi. on the subject of the war,
in which the author declared that the
first duty of thinking beings was to
abolish war. He refused to admit that
a Russian victory would mean the
spread of civilization, and said he was
not convinced that civilization was
found in Europe merely because the
Europeans had created artificial needs,
such as railways and telegraphs, add
ing:
"It is not by these modern Inventions
that we must judge the development of
the human mentality."
Asked whether he bad not made some
reservation on the subject of the prac
tical application of the ideas which he
preached, Tolstoi said:
"To be auite sincere, I am not en
tirely freed from the notion of patriot
ism and I feel that It persists, despite
myself, owing to atavism and educa
tion; but when I examine my funda
mental duty I eay unreservedly that
no reason In* the world stands before
the reasons of humanity, arid my con
science tells me that slaughter, under
whatever pretext, is execrable; that
war is a monster scourge, and that
everything leading to war is to be utter
ly condemned."

NEW YORK, April 4.â Mrs. N. F.
Scranton, a missionary to Korea of the
Woman's Foreign Missionary Society
of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
who is now at home on leave, received
a letter to-day from Miss Josephine O.
Paine, principal of the Methodist Girls'
School at Seoul, dated March 1. The
letter says in part: â¢ *
"First, about our Pingyang mission
aries. The women and children have
everything packed, ready to leave as
eoon as they can be brought away, but
as yet a transport can go no farther
north than Haichou. Dr. Allen, the
American Minister, says if it lyecomes
necessary he will have them come over
land to that place and have the trans
port meet them there. On \ Saturday
morning the Japanese met a number
of Russian scouts somewhere near
Kija's grave, near Pingyang, but they
retreated as soon as they were fired
upon. The Japanese are keeping the
ground warm between here and Ping
yang. Every day for more than two
weeks they have been pouring into
Seoul, and every morning for the past
week or ten days they have been leav
ing for Pingryang.
"We 'are feeling a little anxious about
the people at Siancheng. Dr. Allen
telegraphed for the women and chil
dren to go to Pingyang. They tele
graphed back for coolies and said they
must bring their food to last going
and coming. Dr., Allen has word that
Miss Kearas and Miss Samuels have
reached Pingyang, but as yet Mrs.
Koss, Mrs. Sharrocks, their* four chil
dren and Miss Shields (these ladies are
Presbyterian missionaries') had not yet
arrived. â¢ -
"Seoul is full of Japanese troops.
They are even quartering them on the
Koreans. In all the large houses the
women have been put in the back
rooms and the front rooms have been
given to the soldiers. I do not need
to mention prices, for we are paying
war prices. About the 1st of January,
when Miss Frey and I saw what was
coming, we bought rice and beans
enough to keep the school children from
being hungry until late in the spring.

PARIS. April 5. â According to the
SL Petersburg correspondent of the
Echo de Paris. General Mlshtschenko
and Colonel Pavloff have telegraphed
General Kuropatkin that they will dis
appear for some time with their Cos
eackp, but will soon reappear at a lo
cality which is kept, a secret.
The St. Petersburg correspondent of

ing to advices from Port Arthur, the
Russians have laid many submarine
mines at the mouth of the Yalu River
and the Liao River. He adds that the
general staff has ordered the arming
of the forts and batteries at Libau
and that the measure has caused great
excitement in that district.
The Tokio correspondent of the

most to restore the confidence of the
Koreans.
ST.. PETERSBURG. April 4.â As
the " time ' approaches for the opening
of land operations on a large scale the
Russian .'authorities are exercising
greater vigilance to prevent the news
of their plans going abroad, where it
might be of service to the enemy. For
ten days not a scrap of information
has been given out or. has come from
the front. There practically exists an
embargo upon news dispatches, those
coming through being colorless and
devoid of importance. Information
regarding what. is actually occurring
is being well concealed. It is as if an
impenetrable curtain had suddenly
been rung down on the stage of the
war in East Asia. .
Behind this curtain the greater ac
tivity prevails. General Kuropatkin,
at his temporary headquarters in
Liaoyang, is directing the execution of
his plans, moving the troops, strength
ening the positions selected, oiling the
wheels of the commissariat and quar
termaster departments, perfecting the
hospital service and otherwise looking
after the organization and Innumera
ble wants of the army in the field.

real developments begin the curtain
which shuts out the view of the spec

is pure guesswork. . That the general's
plan of compalgn has been worked out
and that;, as previously stated in these
dispatches,, it involves the playing of
a waiting game until the disposition
of the army has been completed can
be stated positively. It can also be as
serted that these plans are progress
ing even more rapidly than was ex
pected. Every day is now considered
a distinct gain for the Russians and
a distinct loss for the Japanese. For
this reason it can be confidently pre
dicted that the Russians will not do
more than harass the Japanese ad
vance in Korea. The gradual with
drawal of the Russians does not mean
anything as determining the fighting
capacities of the men of the respective
armies, as this is part of the Russian
tactics.
The melting of the snow In the
mountainous country will render Im
passable in the syring the. roads over
which the- Japanese must come, | and
this Is considered - to be almost as
effective an opposition as would a Rus
sian army corps.
EXPECT FLANK ATTACKS.
The Russians also count on a Japan
ese flanking movement In connection
with"-' a frontal attack and, therefore,
a Russian force has been disposed
along the Tumen to prevent the en
trance of a Japanese column there.
Another' flanking movement is expect
ed at the head of the Liaotung Gulf,
near Newchwang, and everything there
is being prepared to receive the enemy;
but for the present the Russian mili
tary authorities believe that the Jap
anese game at this point has been
blocked by the failure of the enemy to
blockade and render immovable thÂ«
fleet of Vice Admiral Makaroff, which,
while free, will be too great a menace
to the movements of Japanese trans
ports in the Gulf of Pechili. Another
effort to block Port. Arthur is conse
quently expected dally.
One of the principal reasons for Vice
roy Alexleff's visit to Port Arthur is
understood to have been a desire for
a conference with Vice Admiral Maka
roff with a view to frustrating these
plans, and all possible precautions have
been taken. Indeed, it is hinted in
high quarters that the next time the
Japanese appear off Port Arthur they
will find a surprise awaiting them.
HARBIN AN ARMED CAMP.
A correspondent en route to the front,
writing from Harbin on March 13, de
scribes the scene there as he observed
it. Â¦ ,
From all sides soldiers were pouring
into Harbin, the uncompleted railroad
station being transformed Into a bar
racks, Tvhile almost every house in the
town was occupied by soldiers.
Prlstan, a short distance away, "which
until recently had been a small village
on the bank of the Sungari River, had
become a city with temporary build
ings which were being used by the
troops and with stores and restau
rants.
The snow-fllled streets of the two
cities were f thronged "by picturesque
Cossacks, bearded Siberians, sharp
shooters and galloping . orderlies, all
imbued with the fever to get to the
front. Merchants Â»Â¦ and restaurateurs,
the correspondent adds, were accused
of extortion, but money was .cheap.
Spring was coming in, though violent
snow storms continued to rage.
Russian Horsemen Will
Depart From the
Main Army.
Kuropatkin Now Ready
to Resist Invasion
of Manchuria.
Japanese scouts have occupied Wiju. which is on the cast bank of the . Yalu River". and "only a few
miles from Its mouth. Apparently the Russians have withdrawn to the west side of the river,, thus leav
ing the Jflkado's forces In complete control of Northwestern Korea.
In a dispatch to a London newspaper It Is reported that the Japanese fleet renewed the bombard
ment of Port Arthur on Sunday. No details are siven and no confirmation of the report has come from any
source.
Since General Kuropatkin's arrival at Liaoyang the Russian censors have placed an embargo upon
all news concerning the movements of troops. Kuropatkin is rapidly arranging for the carrying' out of his
plan of campaign. Tort Arthur has been strengthened and Xewchwang's defenses have been put into con
dition to withstand attack. Each day of Japan's delay in striking a "decisive blow Is proving of inestimable
advantage to the Russians, who have been enabled to complete the mobilization of their forces. Bad roads,
incidental to the spring thaw, are hampering the Japanese advance through Western Korea.
The commanders of two bodies of Cossack horsemen operating with this Russian army on the Yalu
River Informed the commander in chief that they are about to embark upon some secret mission, which will
necessitate their absence for some time. These two forces have the status of- raiders, whose present duty is
to harass the Japanese advance, and their leaders are permitted to operate on their own initiative without
being hampered by orders from headqnarters. It is probable that some flanking movement is to be attempt
ed against the advancing Japanese. .
China, through one of hrr generals at Lassa, has made a formal request .to the commander of the
British expedition that he withdraw his force from Tibet.
The report that Russian authorities hauled down an American flag in Ncwchwang is now declared
to have boon without foundation. No report of the alleged occurrence has reached the State Department
in Washington.

Many stories are being told of the
lay* General Gordon, most of them re
lating to his chivalry and gallantry to
women. A correspondent of the Kan
sas City Star writes that he will never
forget the general's reply at a recep
tion in London once, when asked if
Â¦he had time to be introduced to some
ladies. "Time to be introduced to la
dles?" came the gallant retort, "I
would have time for that if I were on
a cavalry charge." Another story, told
by the same correspondent, quotes the
general's comment upon seeing the
picture of "Napoleon's Coronation" at
Versailles, where the Emperor takes
the crown from the Pope after he has
blessed it, and, first placing it upon his
own head, then places it upon Jose
phine's, saying: "Josephine, I crown
thee, also." General Gordon said:
"The greatest military genius of the
world, but he threw away the love of
a devoted woman, and his evil genius
pursued him ever after."

SAN DIEGO. April 4â John H. Gay,
the millionaire, owner of much realty
in this city and Los 1 Anseles, who has
been before the courts of this county
as a defendant In one of the most sen
sational divorce suits that has ever
been tried here, is now a defendant Â»ri
a criminal action, which was com
menced to-day in Justice Andersons
court on complaint of Ell Smith, his
colored servant for the past five or six
years. , ,-â¢''â¢ ~*
The charge is assault with a deadly
weapon, to wit: a revolver loaded with
powder and ball.
After Gay was arrested and brought
into court late this afternoon he de
pcsited cash bail to the amount of J2000
and was permitted to return to his
automobile and start for his handsome
brownstone residence on upper Fifth
street without hindrance from officer
or jailer.
It seems that the alleged assault oc
curred yesterday morningr. When Gay
was at the breakfast table, according
to the story of the complainant, some
thing occurred which did not please the
millionaire, and hot words were fol
lowed by an altercation, in which Gay
used both a revolver and a cane. The
revolver did no damage, though the
bullets flew in the direction of the col
ored servant. Gay's aim was better
with the cane. He landed on the back
of the servant's neck a blow that nearly
floored him and incapatiatefl him en
tirely for some minutes.
There iÂ§ a variance in the reports as
to the number of shots fired. The
colored man claims that two were fired
before the cane was used and one
afterward. Another without
definite source, has it that three shots
were fired after the cane was used.
Smith, with the assistance of another
servant, managed to get. to a dactor's
office, where his Injuries were attended
to. The blow landed on, the first
dorsal vertebrae and appears to have
ha dthe effect of partially paralyzing
the complainant.
Smith is close to 70 years of age and
had been in Gay's employ for about
five years.

CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, April 4.â Miss Alice
Roosevelt went to the races on Satur
day. She made a bet on a race.
A photographer pictured her in the
act of. giving money to a commission
er; of showing her winnings triumph
antly to Representative Gillett of Mas
sachusetts; of giving money to Repre
sentative Longworth of Ohio, presum
ably to be wagered, and in two groups
watching the horses running.
The results are manifold. Miss Koose
velt has been packed off to New York,
to remain until the-Tacing season ends.
Miss Roosevelt drove over to Ben
nings on Saturday with a party of
friends. Representative "Nick" Long
worth of Ohio was her especial escort.
Longworth comes from Cincinnati and
is rich and handsome. He is a great
favorite in the set of the President's
daughter.
She went to the club house as a guest
of President Howland of the Washing
ton Jocke'y Club. There were betting
commissioners at the clubhouse. Miss
Roosevelt wanted to bet. She did not
make big wagers and everything was
done in the exuberance of her lively
girlhood.
In some way the news reached the
President that pictures showing Miss
Roosevelt at the racetrack had been
taken and offered for sale.. He made
a" hasty inquiry, found that five pic
tures had been printed and sent out
friends to stop, their publication. He
was successful, for to-night the pho-'
tographer told^ everybody to whom he
had offered the pictures that he would
not sell them.
He said he had been paid -nothing by
the President and that he would , not
take any money, but the President's
friends had made it so clear to him
that Miss Roosevelt's lark misht be
vrongfully construed if the pictures
were printed that he had decided to
sacrifice whatever profit there might
be in it and suppress the pictures. He
said he would not take $10,000 for the
pictures, simply because he thought it
would be an injustice to the President
and to Miss Roosevelt to have them
printed.
The President had a serious talk with
his daughter. He told her to go t-j
New, York on a visit and not to return
until after the races. She left, at .11
o'clock this morning.

Carr's connection with the case grew
out of the arrest several days ago of
Seymour Miller of 1527 Minturn street,
who was endeavoring to sell one of the
stolen cameras!. When arrested he said
he had purchased the instrument from
Carr. The pawnbroker denied all knowl
edge of the sale, but later admitted he
had made it- Church upon being ar
rested confessed he had sold his loot
to Carr and that the latter said he
would secure him a position In a hard
ware store, where $5 worth of goods
could be stolen dally and the proceeds
of their sale could be divided between
them.
Carr will be arrested to-day on
charges of receiving stolen goods and
failure to make an entry In his books.
Church is wanted for stealing $160
worth of silk and shawls from Miss B.
Lindner of 11 Â£0 Guerrero street on De
cember 1L 1903; for deserting from
Troop A, Fifteenth Cavalry. U. S. A.,
on November 20 of the same, year; for
swindling several sporting goods firms
out of revolvers, and for victimizing
two photo supply houses out of valu
able cameras.

have brought to light a hitherto un

said I no. Then Heney undertook, on
cross-examination, to bring out the
fact that the Witness knew another
member of .the alleged conspiracyâ

- The last witness for the day was
D. Alexander, a searcher' of titles at
Portland,' Ore., who also testified .be

Schneider. f-V" his evidence yesterday
amounted j to ; no jj more than v {hat- of
McCusker: and 1 dorbett. The hearing
will go on this- morning. -' :
in 1903 the department had suspended
all selections of lieu lands in which
the defendants were interested. . Still
later an order had been made sus
pending, all selections in which Cali
fornia or Oregon school lands were
offered as a "base"; of exchange.
All; the attorneys for the defense
took . turns In questioning Fimpl^
again when "Heney had finished with
him. " f The witness readily admitted
that he had never met Hyde or Di
mond at Washington, but. refused to
admit fchat many of 1 the acts with
which they are, charged were! regular
and in accordance with the usual
practice of â¢ attorneys. of good standing
with the department. In closing his
testimony :he. made" the .interesting
statement that owing to the rapid ln
icrease in the business'of the land of
fice and in the improvement In Its
methods the receipts during the last
fiscal' year Were $4,600,000 In excess
of those of the. previous twelvemonth.
NEGATIVE WITNESSES.
A pretty row arose over Heney's at
tempt.to call out evidencchinting that
the defendants had- tried to palm off
the same lands on the /.Government
twice tn exchange for lieu lands, but
after the' lawyers had 'wrangled Jongr
over the questions and ; ,the Commis
sioner had overruled the. objections of
the defense. Fimple could /only Â¦ say/
"I understand that such attempts were
made." The answer, was stricken out
as hearsay. _ Heney; will^probably re
call Chief Examiner .Valk. and question

HINTS AT DUPLICATION.
"As a matter of course," replied
Heney, "the Indictment must allege a.
conspiracy within the last three years
in order to come within the statute of
limitations, but we shall show that in
fact the defendants first began con
spiring to defraud the Government
many years before the date. set forth
in the Indictment. Where there, is evi
dence of a conspiracy we have the
right to show similar acts prior to the
crime charged." . :
The instructions offered* were ad
mitted by the Commissioner, as were
many other documents of a like char
acter presented later under. similar ob
jections from the defense.
McEnerney asked that the Govern
ment be ordered to \ produce- all' ab
stracts of title and deeds of relinquish
ment covering , the, selections named in
the thirty-four counts, of the.indict
ment. Heney at once countered vvith
an offer to admit that the relinquish
ments were in proper form, if the se
lector offering the lands to the Govern
ment was actually the owner of those
lands. McEnerney, however, was to3
shrewd to be caught and he declined
the offer,' while his associate, Bert
Schleslnger, made a formal demand' for
the original deeds and other Â¦ papers,
saying: "The indictment charges the
defendants with giving the Government
forged and fraudulent titles. -We want
light on what we have forged."
But Heney' refused to give up the
documents and the Commissioner de
clined to grant the order compelling
him to do so. Then a variety of ques
tions â the reason for not'> publishing
proposed withdrawals, rules to 'pre
vent speculators from obtaining ad
vance information of such contemplate
ed reserves, the regulations of the
land office making all
and communications; regarding pro
posed reserves private' and -confiden
tial, and many other matters of like
character â were threshed out with the
aid of the assistant commissioner's
full knowlegde of the subject and his
clear, precise statements; of law- and
practice in the -Interior Department.
Government officials and other wit
nesses that testified before the Federal
Grand Jury at Washington in the land
fraud case again occupied the day yes
terday before United States Commis
sioner Heacock. As before, they were
called at the Instance of .defendants,
Hyde and Dimond, and questioned by
their attorneys to bring out' facts con
tradicting the Indictment. On cross
examination the Government ; counsel
succeeded in getting on the record some
matters leading up to the' bribery
charge, which they may attempt to
prove later.
John H. Fimple, assistant commis
sioner of the General Land Office, was
recalled to the stand in the morning
for further cross-examination and told
in detail of the instructions given forest
superintendents, supervisors, and other
agents of the office. relating to the se
lection of lands for withdrawal as for
est reserves. Printed instructions dat-'
ing- as far back as 1891 were offered in
evidence by Francis J. Heney, special
counsel for the Government These
documents were objected to by. Garret

fense as being of too remote* a date
to sustain a conspiracy alleged to have
been formed In the year 1901. j

Northern Securities continued to be
the only active feature among the mer
ger stocks on the curb. A few lots sold
as high as 99^. Only one odd lot of
stubs changed hands.
The heavy demand developed for
Union Pacific revived the Impression of
buying for control of that property as
an offset to the contest over Northern
Pacific control. The sentiment in the
stock market was nervous and appre
hensive in consequence of this indica
tion, and prices fluctuated in a very
hesitating manner throughout the day.
The general level of prices did not get
far from Saturday's level after the
dip at the opening, as the traders
seemed fearful of making: ventures on
either side of the market. Union Pa
cific touched 90 later in the day.
Northern Securities was the only
merger stock traded in on the curb
during the morning. At noon the stock
was quoted at 99, a decline of a quar
ter point from the high price. Sales
amounted to 3300 shares. Aside from
the sale of an odd lot of Great North
ern there was no business In that
stock, nor Northern Pacific or North
ern Securities stubs.
On the curb Northern Securities was
the only merger stock in which any
actual trading was done in the first
half-hour to-day. It opened at 3S, a
decline of two points from Saturday's
high price, sold off to 97Vi,then back to
SS. About 1500 shares changed hands in
the i first half hour. There were no
transactions In the other stocks, but
bid and offered prices were wide apart.
Northern Securities stubs was 225 bid,
offered at 250; Northern Pacific was
132 bid, offered at 140, and Great North
ern was 168 bid, offered at 172.
XEW YORK, April 4.â The petition
by Union Paciiic interests to enjoin the
Northern Securities plan of distribution
unsettled the stock market to-day and
caused feverish fluctuations. These
seemed due to puzzled efforts on the
part of the professional traders to find
the market without any clear Idea of
the actual effect on the news of the
values. The only fact left clear was
that the suppositions on which they
have traded for two weeks were un
founded. Their conflicting efforts to
retrieve probable mistakes caused a
very confused price movement, but the
undertone was weak on account of the
apparent hostility between great
groups of capitalists. Union Pacific
opened 1% higher than Saturday's close
and then receded as much below that
level. St. Paul broke 2Va- on the open-
Ing sale and recovered half the loss
while Union Pacific was running: off.
Losses ran to a point in a number of
railroad stocks and specialties and
prices ran downward and upward In a
hesitating manner. In the course of an
hour the market became quieter.
Rev. C. I*. Miel, the, rector of the
church, is very popular among â¢ all
classes of people in Sacramento, and
when work was begun on his church
there was a celebration, in which the
Mayor and many citizens took part.
Rev. Mr. Miel said to-day the action in
calling off the men was any
notice whatever, and he said that had
the matter been officially called to his
notice or that" of his vestry, no doubt
it could have been amicably adjusted.
The church is designed to be one of
the handsomest in the State. '
SACRAMENTO, April 4.â On the or
der of the walking delegate of the
Building Trades CoVincil work was
stopped to-day on the new St. Paul's
Church at Fifteenth and J streets. The
men working under Andrew Carlaw, a
contractor for masonry, as well as the
men employed by Young & Hall, stone
cutters, were cailed off of the Job.
The church is being constructed of
granite and the work of the masons is
necessarily slow^ It appears that a la
borer was employed to mix the mortar,'
only a small quantity of which is need
ed each day. The -walking delegate of
the Building Trades Council discovered
that the mortar mixer was not a union
man, and so the masons and stonecut
ters were ordered out.

Special Dispatch to The Call,
Prices Vary During the Day,
but Buyers Are Reluctant
to Invest Either Way
Among the advantages of this con
tiguity of the two fields is that they
may be turned into one by simply, re
moving the portable bleachers that will
cross Bowditch street. -This will leave
ample room for a cinder track and ath
letic field. ' It Is estimated that a track
at least a third of a mile around may
be fitted into the space now occupied
by the Hillegass tract.
An immense amount of work will
have to be done before -this project Will
be completed, particularly in the hand
ling - of earth. The tract will first be
cleared of its present soil strata and
the clay' underneath removed until the
proper depth is reached. Then the soil
will all be -replaced and leveled off, this
being necessary in order to provide a
field in which grass may be grown.
This revised plan is In the hands of
the' executive committee of the Asso
ciated Students, who hold daily con
sultations with Architect Howard. It
Is now In such a shape that it is prac
tically settled, and all that ls.necessary
is the official action of the committee,
which \ meets to-morrow night. Ezra
Decoto, graduate manager for the As
sociated' Students, said to-day that he
did not doubt that work would begin
within a week.
John Galen Howard, supervising
architect for the university, has been
opposed for a long time to the closing
of Bowditch -street, as he wished to
maintain its integrity In order to con
form to the Hearst plans "for the star
dium. But Mr. Howard was prevailed
upon to-day to remove his objections.
However, the street will not be alto
gether closed, as Mr. Howard has sub
mitted a plan for handsome gates on
each side of the tract that Is accepta
ble to the executive committee of the
Associated Students, which has the
thing in charge.
The baseball field will be at the east
end of the tract.' It will lie between
Bowditch street and Hearst Hall, Ban
croft way and Strawberry Creek. Its
diamond will occupy the same relative
position that the diamond on the regu
lar campus does now. .
MUCH WORK NEEDED.
In revising the plan no change has
been made in the location of the foot
ball or baseball fields. The football
field will- lies between Bowditch and
Barrow streets. Bancroft way and
Strawberry Creek. The bleachers and
fence on" tne north *side will overlap
Bowditch street somewhat, but these
will be made portable so that they
may be moved at will.
The original plan has been abandon
ed for two or three good reasons. First
of these is the monumental expense it
would involve. To carry it out would
cost -probably $250,000, and this the As
sociated Students, who woulfl have to
foot the bill, would 'not feel justified
in spending at this time. Another rea
son is that the big excavation would
permanently disfigure the field and
prevent anything ever being done with
it in case radical changes are made in
the methods of playing the game. A
minor reason is that the embankments,
which would have to be about sixty
feet wide at the bottom, would take
up too much room.
Now the plan is to simply level off
the Hillegass tract, which will be the
campus under the Hearst plans, and
erect a fence and bleachers whei'e
reeded. In time this fence and bleach
ers may become a permanent feature
fit the'tract, as it is now thought that
there can be designed a more becom
ing thing than a hole with little hills
around it: Brick walls, with Ivy grow
ing upon them and colonnades and
handsome gates, such as surround
Franklin: Field in: the East, would be
more acceptable in the end. At any
rate it is contemplated that the struc
tures to.be built under the revised plan
will last for fifteen or twenty yearg.
The cost will be about $20,000.
LOCATION NOT CHANGED.
" The football game next year between
Stanford and California will not be
played in a deep hole on ; the campus
at the University, of California, sur
rounded by high embankments ( of
earth tiered with bleachers rubbing
their backs against the sky. That
plan has been abandoned and instead
there wiil only be a humble > fence,
adorned with humbler bleachers and . u
grand stand of the same degree of
humbleness. â¢ â¢.:Â¦Â¦;< â¢.-;'<Â¦Â¦

Hatton is a stepdaughter of . the de

Hartery committed suicide about a

OAKLAND, April 4.â Always beautiful. Ar
bor Villa took on added charms under, the dec
orator's mag-lc touch to-day, and when M!sÂ»
Anna . Mae Burdge became the bride of Ber
nard- Miller this evening It was within a ver
itable temple of beauty, glowing with the
fragrant wealth of spring. This was the
first wedding that has been solemnized in the
home. of Mr. and/Mrs. F. M. Smith, and noth
ing that good taste could suggest was left
undone by these ' generous guardians to mak?
the happy occasion a memorable one In e-.-ery
rc sjiect.
'ihe ceremony took place in the targe, oc
tagon-shaped ] reception hall. " Before the wide
door leading into the conservatory, and di
rectly opposite the broad stairway, two bronifi
Corinthian pillars, surmounted by rose-fllleti
vases, formed the gate to a square,- within
which the happy couple stood while repeating
the vows that made tnem man' and wife. From
each pillat a railing of- Easter- lilies extended
to the stairs, making this - a pattf through
which the bridal party proceeded to the al
tar. ' Â¦ Suspended from the gallery that â¢ over
hangs the hall were four baskets filled with
long-stemmed .American . .Beauty roa.es. \ The
conservator}' was illuminated ' with pale' green
lights and formed a fairy-like background for
the picture presented by the bride and her at
tendants. The "Lohengrin" wedding march was
played by Miss Virginia de Fremery on- the
large pipe organ In the gallery.. The Rev.-
J. K. McLean otflclated.
Promptly at 9 o'clock the bridal party de
scended the stairs, the ushers leadlr* the way.
The first bridesmaid, Mttis Marlon bmlth. fol
lowed, and at her train were the eight bloom
ing bridesmaids, each in white chiffon and
carrying pink carnations tied with wide pink
satin ribbons. Next came Miss Winitred
Burdge, maid of honor, in pink chiffon, her be
ruffled skirt and l&O bodice adorned with
clusters ot chiffon roses and a tiny wreath of.
roses In her hair. -
Escorted by Mr. Smith, at last came the
bride, her dark, brilliant beauty enhanced by
the softly drooping tulle veil and the ivory
sheen of her bridal gown Of sheen mesea-
Ilne, the gown was trimmed with an elaborate
garniture of point lace â the flounces on the
skirt, the deep yoke and berthe belns of the
lace, caught in cobweb folds with clusters of
orange blossoms. Full, angel sleeves of chit
foa fell from the elbow. A shower of-UUes
of-tKe-valley completed a very charming cos
tume.
The bridesmaids were: Grace Sperry. Evelyn
Ellis. Florence Nightengale, Marlon Goodfel
low, May Coogan, May Baker and Carolyr
Oliver.
The' bridesmaids' gowns were each fashioned
much "the same, fluffy in effect, with chiffon
roses catching the draperies here and there,
and each wore a wreath of tiny green leaves In
her hair.
Mr. Miller was attended by Clay Goodlng
and the ushers were Will GorrlU. Ralph Jones,
Harold Havens, Arthur \ Goodfellow, Hartley
Peart, Traylor Bell, Stanley Moore, Joseph
King and Roland Oliver.
The ceremony was witnessed by about one
hundred and fifty guests, the more intimate
friends of the young* couple, but later several
hundred guests were present at the reception
and supper. The large oval table, where the
bridal party was served, was placed Â» In the
reception hall, that - the bride might be . within
view of all. Ralph Jones presided as toast
master and prepared the way for many | a
graceful speech and merry 3est.
Mr. and Mrs. Miller wilt spend several weeks
in the south and on their return Mr. > Miller
will take his bride to his ' home on Boulevard
terrace. Â¦
The wedding of these popular young people
has been eagerly anticipated by the smart set
for several months . and seldom has a bride
been followed by so many good wishes or so
happily launched on the matrimonial sea. Her
popularity was 'attested by the many exquisite
gifts showered .upon her. Mrs. Smith's souve
nir took the form of a chest of solid silver,
complete to the smallest detail.
Mr. Miller is a Â¦ prosperous attorney of this
city and a well-known club man. whose his
trionic talent has made him always a desirable
social acquisition. . . ' â¢ .

of Ferdinand Koenlg, when his youngest and
only unmarried ' daughter. Miss Wllhelmina

ties are under the control of J. T. Wil

Western Pacific, and while the parties
themselves refuse to discuss their em
ployment,-the presence of -Mr. Williams

SURVEYING NEW LINE. .
OAKLAND, April 4.â The hiljs be
tween Oakland and Contra Costa Coun
ty, the flats" at Walnut Creek and the
islands and tule lands of the Sacra
menta River are occupied by men with
transit and chain. No. less than three
railroad surveying parties are at work
at different points in this district. The
Southern Pacific is determined to main
tain Its hold on the traffic of this neigh
borhood and has completed all of the
preliminary work necessary to protect
itself against invasion of a rich sec
tion it has monopolized for many years.
The result of all this activity is that
the interior of Conjtra Costa County,
long neglected and practically isolated
from the outside world, is awakening
with a new hope that it is to be brought
into easy touch with tidewater on San
Francisco Bay.
, The . fchird move Is being made by
the . San\a Fe- system: , When it , pur
chased-? the California and Nevada
Railroad to get a connection between
.Point Richmond and Oakland, it; also

line running through the San Ramon

complete the survey from Walnut
Creek' to the banks of the Sacramento
River opposite Chips Island. This is
the narrowest point on the river and
could be crossed by ferry or bVidge._
. It is a fact that Chips Island has been
bonded, and also the Bowen ranch, on
the south bank of the river, both tran
sactions having taken place within the
last few weeks. There is also a party
of 'surveyors working north along the
ba^c'of the Sacramento River running
lines through Colllnsville and Rio
Vista.
This outlines a froute from Oakland
to Sacramento thai is as short as that
of the Southern Pacific Railroad and
opens up a, country that is at present
almost out of the world.
That the other great railroad sys
tems, the Santa Fe and the Southern
Pacific, appreciate the effort \ being
made to invade this section is very evi
dent^ and they are preparing to do
work that has long been neglected.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
"He became intimate with Miss Engle
while she was in my employ. She left
me a month ago to accept a place, in
Alameda. On Thursday last she sent
for Mrs. Lucy McDonald, my house
keeper, and to her she told of her trou
bles with Bulkeley. She said that he
had announced his engagement .to my
niece and that their relations must
cease. She said she had always under
stood that they were engaged and in
tended to see Bulkeley and force him
to acknowledge it, even if it took a
pistol to do so. This it seems she did
not do." -
Bulkeley says this is all untrue, and
he goes Into details in support of v his
contention that it is all animus on the
part of Mrs. Hutchins that is respon
sible for the girl's rash act and the
discomfiture of himself and friends.
According to his story, Mrs. Hutchins
was bent on, breaking up the engage
ment between himself and Miss Fargo.
He said further:
. "I swear that I never was intimate
with Miss Engle! I never paid any
more attention to her than I would to
any, other servant. Mrs. Hutchins ob
jected to my marrying her niece and
she told some scandalous stories, link
ing my name and the girl's. Miss Engle
told me these and through friends I
sought a vindication. That got Miss
Engle into trouble with Mrs. Hutchins
and sh'e came to me to secure vindi
cation for herself. That was last Sat
urday. I told her I could not retract
anything and she went' away without
being disappointed, apparently. Now
she has tried to kill herself, but it is
not my fault."
"The n^xt day she went to Berkeley,
but I did not have an opportunity to
talk with her. That night she tried to
commit suiqide. Since then she has
told me that the stories about her were
untrue and that her attempt at suicide
was due tc the malice of others. I be
lieve her story fully, for she was al
ways a good girl and very industrious."
Two different stories are told by the
Berkeley people interested in Miss
Marie Engle. Lewis E. Bulkeley tells
one story and Mrs. A. A. Hutchins tells
another. Mrs. Hutchins is the proprie
tor of the Walworth, where Bulkeley
was a guest and Miss Engle a waitress.
Ther? was also there a Miss Marjory
Fargo, a niece of Mrs. Hutchins and
the fiancee cf Bulkeley. Mrs. Hutchins
strongly opposed the . attentions of
Bulksley toward her niece, and even
went so far one day as to order him
to leave her house after they had had
words about it. Mrs. Hutchins pays
that the basis of her opposition to
Bulkeley was his intimacy with Miss
Engle. This Is. what Mrs. Hutchins said
to-day when asked about the case:
"Mr. Bulkeley's conduct while at my
house was distasteful to me. I had
noticed his attentions to young women
working in the neighborhood and I
heard other stories to his discredit. As
I was without positive proof I did not
interfere with him until he engaged
himself to my niece. . I tried to break
c-ff their relations, but neither would
listen to me. I told him one day that
I would report him to President Wheel
er, and that led to his insulting me so
that L had to order him to leave the
house.
Miss Engle told her mistress, Mrs.
Delanoy, her story to-daÂ£. Mrs. Dela
noy expresses full confidence in her
statement, saying: t
"Friday evening the Mrs. Lucy Mc-
Donald that is referred to in the story
called upon Marie at our house. She
had a talk with the girl, and I noticed
after she left that Marie was down
hearted. 1 questioned Marie, with the
result that she told me her story. She
said Mrs. McDonald told her that Lewis
E. Bulkeley had been making state
ments derogatory to her (Marie's)
character; that she hardly knew
Bulkeley. except that he boarded at a
house in Berkeley where she was 'a
waitress, anYi that the stories were un
true.
The tongue of criticism has caused
much trouble on this side of the bay.
It caused Miss Marie Engle to attempt
suicide in Alameda Saturday night; it
caused Mrs. A. A. Hutchins to try and
break up an engagement j and order
Lewis E. Bulkeley.out of her house,
and it caused tbe young man in ques
tion to indulge In a lot of criticism of
everybody in general. Meanwhile Miss
Engle is still at the Delanoy residence
In Alameda, and will recover. Her
parents have arrived from Stockton
and will take their daughter home, and
the others in the case are bombarding
one another.

V. Devincenci and Angelo Legoria,
scavengers, were arrested to-day and
charged with violating the ordinance
that prohibits the' collection of gar
bage in this city by any one other than
agents' of the Pacific Incinerating
Company. This move was made by
the Board of Health, which has adopt
ed this method of prosecuting the
scavengers rather than that of ar
resting them for using the dumping
grounds at West Oakland.
Prosecuting Attorney A. P. Leach
to-day decided that -It was doubtful
whether, the scavengers had violated
the law when they deposited garbage
on private property with the owner's
permission. The Prosecuting Attor
ney was of the opinion that the spe
cific ordinance which prohibited
dumping of garbage might have been
repealed by the crematory ordinance.
As the later ordinance makes it a mis
demeanor for other than authorized
agents of the crematory company to
collect garbage, the fight will be made
along that line.
- The Scavengers' Union has prepared
to go Into court to resist prosecution
and to force a test of the validity of
the garbage crematory ordinance and
the contract under which the inciner
ating company is working. : '.

"In an examination of the evidence
a letter is produced written by him

Frank Rush worth looks well and
acts nicely as the soldier, lover, and Ar
thur Lawrerfce makes up realistically
as Bonaparte and faithfully follows, the
traditional gestures of that celebrated
man. Comedian Joe Herbert shatters
the Parisian atmosphere by American
izing alLthe humcr. allotted to him and
ihtroducmg a groat deal of stuff that
Is not 'to be found in French literature.
In the four acts of "Mam'selle Napo
kon" as presented by Anna Held and
her people last evening at the Colum
bia Theater there is sufficient of the
most popular elements of go-called
musical comedy to satisfy the most ex
acting admirer of that class of enter
tainment. The dramatic situations run
the gamut from lofty tragedy to ec
centric comedy, the music embraces
everything from plagiarized oratorio to
Interpolated ragtime, both inclusive,
and the stage pictures are marvels of
luxurious scenic art. As musical com
edy is a commonly accepted synonym
for incongruity, the less said about the
story, its mode of narration and its ap
propriateness of illustration the better.
But. taken either in sections or Its en
tirety, "Mam'selle Napoleon" is very
far ahead In both quantity and quality
of the best of its species that preceded
it on the same stage. In comparison it
reduces the luster of "A Chinese
Honeymoon" to the illumination afford
ed by a tallow dip, and It takes all the
sheen off "The Silver Slipper." Even
the big "Weber-Fields show, that did
such tremendous business for two
weeks at the Grand Opera-house, would
appear a paltry affair if stacked up
against "Mam'selle Napoleon."
Briefly told, the tale revolves around
a Parisian actress that loves an officer
of Napoleon's favorite guards. This at
tachment is utilized by the Minister of
Police to promote one 'of his political
tricks, and in the development of the
sub-plot quite a number of famous his
torical personages, including the great
little Corslcan himself, are introduced.
Much of the original coherence of the
tale has been. ignored in the American
translation â or at least the Anna Held
productionâ and inference is taxed to
connect the remaining glimpses. But
the costumery and the upholstery have
been left Intact, and there are other
things than the story to engage the in
terest of the average witness. Chief of
them is Miss Held herself.
The dainty little woman Is very
n-.uch in evidence throughout the piece,
end her magnetism never wanes for an
instant. Her delicious accent In song
or speech Is no more expressive than
her eloquent* eyes or her -, sinuous
shrugs, and her art Is accentuated by
the mediocrity of her supporting prin
cipals of her own sex. . Handsome wo
men they arc, all of .them,' and they,
display * their physical ? graces to the
very best advantage, but there is not
an artist among them. The. petite
star's body guard of twelve tall and
shapely "show girls" is a sight in it
self worth going to see. and occasion
ally a young. woman s^eps out of the
chorus and does something clever in a
terpsichorean way, but the vocal side
of the production is neither fair nor
middling.

Figman is slightly too rapid of speech

Mrs. Fiske is gayety. inconsequence,
charm it pelf as the foolish wife, won
hack to her husband by his device of
pretending to agree to a divorce. Bos
worth's husband is only too handsome
for his description of a person with
As surprising In this fashion, as it
was wholly delightful, is Mrs. Fiske's
flower girl in "A Bit of Old Chelsea."
In new Arabian Nights' fashion the
girl faints outside of an artist's studio
and is brought in to share his lodging
for the night. Nothing could be more
charming than the ingenuous yet ex
perienced, courteous yet unconvention
al, brave, clean-hearted, self-respecting
lassie that Mrs. Fiske pictures. So
easily the character might be sloppily
sentimental, so breezily wholesome is
it, with the freshness of a daisy, the
salt charm pt a sea breeze. Her exit,
where with the gift of her freshest
flower to the sleeping artist, she leaves
her host cf the night, is of the things
that stick in the throat. Frank Gil
more, who wore the toga in "Mary of
Magdala" so effectively, helps out well
as the artist and the others fill in to
every advantage.
"Divorcons" is remarkable after the
second incarnation of Mrs. Fiske as
Cyprienne for the discovery of the
raison d'etre of Hobart Bosworth, who
has failed severely so far in the Fiske
engagement. As DesPrunelles Bosworth
vindicates his right to act. He carries
off th? character of the undeceived
husband with convincing lightness and
good humor. The whole thing floats
in fact. It is as French as Sardou him
self. The company throughout catches
the humor on *t.
Lust night the actress gave us two
new glimpses of her protean art In
"Divorcons" and "A Bit of Old Chel
sea" J-the very thistledown of comedy
and fantasy at Its prettiest. One could
hardly get further* from the "Hedda
GabJer" of last' week, unless it were to
the "Mary of Magdala" of the week
before; nor could Mrs. Fiske get fur
ther. Nay, but this woman is a won
derful thing!
â¢ To be the Hedda saturate of poisoned
brilliancy; the estatlc regenerate, Mary;
the feather-headed Cyprienne; the
swoet-hearted child of the slums, Alex
andria Victoria Belchamberâ all , -with
equal conviction, is. a task to which
the "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" study
in split personalities Is merest a b c.
And Mrs. Fiske fully fulfills It. Versa
tility is a childish term for the variety
of her genius. It is with her a com
plete transformation for the time being
into the character of the moment, each
note of it struck sharply true and vi
tally differentiated from its neighbor
key. Â«â¢
Like Auburn's simple folk, one Is con
strained afresh to wonder "tha^pne
small head could carry all*" he Â¦ (she)
knew" â of Mrs. Fiske, obviously, for is
she not here?
The little company shows that it had
ample time to'prepare for the bill this
week, during the big run of "Parsifal"
by the snappy way in which the farce
goes off. Mr. Durkin looks better. In a
dress suit than In bearskins, and by
the same token Miss Block seems to be
more at home when freed from the
tatterdemalion garments: of Kundry.
Their acting seems to indicateMhat a
reversion to the lighter form of art is
somewhat of a relief. Alkof the mem
ber^ of the cast are sprightly in their
work and the first appearance on any
stage of Sachire Olda; intelligent Jap
anese school boy, is a noteworthy
feature of the show.
If anything were needed to prove the
versatility of the Alcazar company, the
ease with which it descends from, the
sublime of "Parsifal" to the ridiculous
of "On the Quiet" should -fill that of
fice. This week the solemnity and high
religrious fervor of Wagner's master
piece give way most gracefully, to the
rollicking sport of Augustus Thomas'
farce, and though- there Is no trump.et
peal to herald in the } opening of the
play, the salvos of the audience punc
tuate the entire three acts with much
more material sound.

There are a great .many people en

An interesting railroad relic, remin
iscent of the first days of the steam
locomotive, has been discovered, in tlfe
north of England. The Liverpooland
Manchester Railroad Company, the
first public road constructed, it will
be remembered, ' inaugurated a com
petition in the latter part of the twen
ties of the past century for a loco
motive, in which Stephenson and other
inventors participated. Three engines
âthe "Rocket," by Stephenson; the
"Sans Pareil," by Hackworth, and the
"Novelty," by Bralthwaite and Erics
son respectively â participated in the
trials that were carried out in 1830.
As is well known, Stephenson's "Rock
et" secured the award of S2500, which
was offered, as being the most suitable
engine attaining a speed of twenty
nine miles per hour. The "Sans Pa
reil" was second with a speed of twen
ty-three ' miles per hour, while the
"Novelty" withdrew from the trials
owing to the joints of the boiler giving
way when the. locomotive had trav
eled only three miles. Both the
"Rocket" and the "Sans . Pareil" are
now preserved in the South Kensing
ton Museum, but the "Novelty" myste
riously disappeared, and was never
found again until quite recently. It
appears that Ericsson was so morti
fied by the failure" of his conception
that he left it with his friend, Mr.
Melling, who possessed engineering
works located upon a space adjoining
the Rainhill. Station. These â works
were subsequently . dismantled and . the
premises, were occupied by the .Rain
hill Gas and Water : Company. The
"Novelty" .was thus lost sistht of, but
it has now been recognized working
as a stationary engine, the .wheels
having been removed for this purpose
and its identity thus "somewhat dis
guised. Attempts are to be made to
secure this third premier locomotive
and to place it alongside, of its two
contemporaries in the South Kensing
ton Museum.â Scientific American.

The opportunity of studying under such a group of
leaders in every department of learning is sufficient to
excite the emulation of all students, whether they aspire
to the attainment of expert knowledge in some special
department of learning or to general culture. It is
reasonable, therefore, to expect that the students,
whether judged by numbers or by earnestness, will be
worthy of the advantages offered them. The issue is, in
fact, one in which the whole.State may well take an in
terest, for the success of this great undertaking of the
university will reflect credit upon the commonwealth and
add to the reputation of, California for intellectual asWell
as for material eminence among the States of the Union.
OF old it was said: "Nothing is invented and per
fected at the same time." If there be an excep
tion to the general rule embodied in that state
-ment, it is to be found in the system of summer schools,
which has' but recently beeii adopted by our universities,
and yet which has been well nigh perfected ,by the in
ventors of it. In the comparatively short time in which
the summer sessions of the leading universities have
been in operation, enough has been accomplished to give
them a high prestige among our educational institu
tions and to assure their permanency as a part of the
work of the university for the advancement of knowl
edge and the diffusion of culture.
It is gratifying to Californians that in no university
of the country has a greater measure of success been
attained by these sessions than in our own State Univer
sity, whose summer school, now ranks as one of the
Three foremost in the Union, holding place along with
the summer schools of Harvard and o/ Chicago. In
deed, it is quite probable that during the coming sum
mer the work of the sessions at the University of Cali
fornia may take precedence over all, for the array of
lecturers and instructors that have been engaged for the
various courses constitutes a body of teachers and
scientists hardly to be equaled anywhere.
The recently published announcement of the coming
summer school which is to begin June 27 and continue
for six weeks presents a programme of twenty-six
courses. The statement goes on to say:
"Instruction will be given not only. by members of the
regular faculty of the university but by a number of
well-known men of letters and of science from Eastern
universities and from Europe. Among tnese will be
Sir William Ramsay, professor of chemistry in University
College, London; Hugo de Vries, professor of botany in
the University of Amsterdam; Svante August Arrhenius,
professor of physics in the University of Stockholm;

"I was scrubbing all'day at a house,"
she replied, "and was kept late, as
there was a party and I was asked
to help In the kitchen. I got this bun
dle of. old blankets and dresses to take
home with me and I rfeed thorn very
much. But I feel so tired, sir."
The clergyman asked her where she
lived, and, making her rise, he grabbed
hold of the bundle andswung it on to
his back. "Come along with me," he
said, as he started in the direction of
her home. They had not gone far when
a policeman stopped them and, address
ing the clergyman in -a gruff voice,
said: "Say, wh'at are you doing at
this time of night going through the
streets with a bundle on your back?
Let me see what you Lave in it?"
The clergyman dropped the bundle
and the officer at once recognized him.
."I beg your pardon, sir," he humbly
said, as he touched his helmet. "I d>d
not at first know you." The clergy
man briefly explained, and the officer
swung the bundle on his back with the
simple remark; "I am younger and
stronger than you."
A clergyman in the city who is well
known for his charitable work among
the poor, irrespective of their creed,
had a peculiar experience a few nights
ago. He had been visiting a family
on the *North Beach wherein the' head
of the house was c-n a sick bed and
needing pecuniary help to keep the
wolf from the door. He had remained
till late ministering to the physical and
spiritual needs of the family and on
his way home observed an old woman
sitting on top of a large bundle on the
sidewalk.
"What's the matter with you. m/
good woman?" asked the, clergyman in
his kindly way. . â¢

There have been neven cases of im

history of the country. The first was
Representative J. N. Gillette uf Cali
fornia is likely to become famous as
the leader of the opposition to th** pro
posed impeachment " proceedings
against Judge <"harleÂ» Swayne of Flor
ida. Gillette was one of a subcommit
tee of the Judiciary Committee of the
House that went to Florida and in
vestigated on the ground the charges
preferred. The committee numbered
three: Palmer, Republican. Pennsyl
vania: Clayton. Democrat, Alabama,
Â»nd Gillette, Republican. California!
Judge Swayne was not heard in his
own defense in Florida, but came on to
Washington and gave his testimony
before the whole committee. The sub
committee reported to the full Com
mittee on Judiciary, Palmar and Clay
ton a majority and Gillette a minority
report. To the House these two re
ports are carried, representing the
views of the full committee almost
equally divided â eight against seven,
with two Republicans absent, and who.
If present, would probably turn the
minority into a majority, nine to
eight. The majority' at present in com

named. The minority are Gillette. Jen

Thomas, absent at bis home in Iowa,
and Pearre, elck at his home in Mary

the majority.

plete answer to the report of the
majority and covers every point quite
as convincingly as does the other and
goes into important evidence that the

7bÂ« report of the committee will serve
:<f a complaint before the House. The
House will discuss and vote upon it â
whether to impeach or not. If the
verdict is for impeachment then the
matter will be carried before the Sen
ate for trial. The Senate, however, will
give the defendant time to answer and
in the meantime that body will ad
journ. In the event of impeachment
by the House the Senate may be con
vened in November for the purpose of
trying the case before the regular ses
cion.
On Saturday. March 25. with
the passage of the bill, the chair
man of the committee, William
Overstn-et. concluded what had been
literally a battle with the whole
House that has continued day by day
for three weeks. The fight began three
weeks apo over the Brfstow report and
has continued duvn to the last line of
the bill itself, it has witnÂ«-Â«sÂ»-d some
of the most sensational scenes of the
reason and has dragged wearily for
hours through the discussion of pro
posed amendments. Kvery provision
Of the bill has been contested from
one side of the chamber or the other
and to each contestant the chairman
must stard ready to give battle. The
postal service is a thing in which even
hamlet is interested and about which
every intelligent person knows some
thing, and this fact offers an explana
tion of th-* livelv discussion which
drew sonietning from members of the
House who are rarely heard and of
fered opportunity without limit to
those who like to talk. Democrats were
found pleading for expansion and in
crease in salaries quite as often as in
the line of opposition. Since it came
on for consideration the bill has been
taken up immediately after the morn
ing hour every day and its considera
tion continued until nearly 6 o'clock.
Despite the long contest, the bill was
not materially changed. The cutting
out of the appropriation for tarrying
the mail from San Francisco to the
Society Islands was among the most
radical of the amendments. This was
done at the instance of the Democrats,
a sufficient following on the other side
being enlisted to carry it through.
Livernash and Wynn of San Fran
cisco were the only Democrats voting
against it. Uvernash made a strong
speech against the amendment, de
claring the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany now carrying the mail to be
the friend *>f the white sailor on the
Pacific, the Chinaman finding no place
on the ships of the company.
WASHINGTON. April 4â The labor
of Congress over the passage of one of
the general appropriation bills is not
veil represented In the brief reports
of proceedings pent over the country
every day during its course. This la
bor is sometimes immense. Each of
them drag;* its Blow 1-iigih from commit
tee to the floor of the House, from the
Hou*e to Senate committee, from Stn
ate committee to Senate, from Senate
to the eontv-ren<-e committee and from
conference cummiuee back to the
House, and to the Senate with the
final amendments. Of all the bills to
take this course and bring up finally,
cut and shot to pieces, the bill pro
viding for the conduit of postoftkes
and post roads is the one most bÂ»-at
upon from every side and upon which
the division is lt*ast likt-ly to be a party
one.

Looked at in the right light, these two neighboring
cities, allied in so many interests, when wrought upon
by a common spirit of progress and enterprise, with their
combined strength in -business and public affairs, can be
come a potent agency, in directing the spirit of the whole
State. They, in combination, can secure public improve
ments, direct better and more useful legislation, and con
tribute to the profit of every acre and the welfare of
every home in California. Therefore, having set her
face to the future, let Oakland : refuse all temptations to
look backward.
As for other parts of the city, the people may be sure
that when this issue is spent upon the purposes it is in
tended to serve, tjie result will be such an access of,popu
lation and such an increase in values that it will be easy
to secure another issue to put into West Oakland the
line of improvements so long desired.
San Francisco wishes to encourage awakened Oak
land. We can't go over there and vote, but we can
stimulate the spirit of progress that is taking possession
of the people. Each of these cities is helped by the
growth of the other. San Francisco business needs the
use of Oakland harbor for its surplus activities, which
when they are crowded off our own w^ater. front must
go somewhere, and the nearer to us the better. The
Merchants' Association of this city has a sufficient in
terest in Oakland to justify it in going over there to
hold up the hands of the Oakland Board of Trade, help
the Boosters boost and aid the whole booming people
boom.
The late Senator Fair tried for a long time to get a
rival railroad into Oakland, but the people wanted some
thing to fight, and fought him with all the vigor that had
been acquired and trained in fighting the original "Octo
pus," But now the coming of the Santa Fe, the wide
spread operations of the Realty Syndicate, and, the im
provement of the harbor, seem to have wrought a change
in the spirit of the city, and the local Board of Trade, in
its strength and policy, represents the spirit and. pur
pose of a. new Oakland. There is less spirit of conflict
and a higher civic purpose that promise to make Oak
land for some time to. come a. center of interest and
growth in population and in business.
It seems to a friendly observer that the first step to
be taken by the people is the ratification of the very
moderate bond proposition that is soon to be submitted.
The bonds are for the purposes of public improvement
of which Oakland has long felt the need. A modern city
and up to date' requires all the business facilities it can
improve or create. If happily placed between land and
water transportation, it needs the development of both,
in the service of :tÂ« commerce and manufactures. It
should be liberal in the encouragement of its streets and
interurban railway system. In this respect Oakland is
at present fortunate. It has a street railway system that
is equal to the demands of five times the present popula
tion. This, of course, means that investment in that
line has been made on faith in the future of the city.
When the people and the street railways work together
that faith is ju/tified. But with the rise of business facil
ities there must go on also the development of those
other needs of a modern city, parks, scenic features,
good streets and ample and sightly schoolhouses and
public buildings. In these respects a beginning is made
in the proposed bond issue. In arranging for expendi
ture of its results, it may not have been possible to give
to every part of the city as much as the people may Teel
is their due. But this should not influence a vote against
the bonds.
It is admitted that in Lake Merritt and its surround
ings Oakland has features of peculiar value. We recall
no city in the United States or Europe that has in its
midst such a valuable scenic and sanitary feature as that
placid and beautiful body of salt water. San Francisco
has the most attractive park in the world, but it lacked
a body of water and had to create one, artificially, in
Stow Lake. Oakland has that feature ready made, and
should improve its shores and surroundings, by the sup
pression of every ignoble feature. This will fail if the
bonds fail.
Time was that Oakland was as much talked about in
the East as any city in California. This Was when it be
came the terminus of the Central Pacific Railway. But
there ensued a period of lapse, in which it seeme.d that
the energies of the people were entirely invested in fight
ing tlie very agency that had brought the place into no
tice. The habit of battle extended to other things, and
it seemed that an Oaklander counted that day lost'/in
which he had failed to make a kick at something. .
OUR publication of the growth and work of the
Oakland Board of Trade discloses matter of in
terest not only to our neighboring city, but to
San Francisco and the whole State. Oakland has the
finest natural advantages, but has stood too long upon
them alone. Such advantages are valuable only as the
best use is made of them. It is a fatal mistake to trust
to them and expect^ them to work the prosperity of a
city, without any effort on the part of its people.
No one noticed when a photographer
balanced the tablet up on the edge of
the railing about the roof in order that
he might have thlsun full upon It. A
heavy gust of wind or a touch of the
coat sleeve would have sent it crash
ing down to the pavement, fifty feet
below. Just as he was pressing the
button of his camera there wa's a pierc
ing cry from the doorway behind, and
from it rushed the Chinese secretary of
legation. He stumbled over to the pre
cious green stone, seized it from its
precarious resting place and wrapped
it tenderly in the folds of his jacket.
"That man would have lost his head
in China," gasped he, indicating the
photographer. "The safety of this stone
is worth the lives of a dozen such as
he. It contains the soul of an Emperor
dead these 3000 years."
. ,A little over a'year ago the customs
officers seized in the baggage of an
American army officer .returning from
China one of the famous mortuary
tablets of jade from the innermost
temple in the forbidden city of Peking.
The Chinese Government had mourned
the loss of these tablets more than any
of the rest of the loot which had been
carried off from Peking, and Uncle
Sam had given the Chinese assurances
that all of the tablets caught In this
country would be returned.
When Customs Officer Chauncy St.
John had notified the newspaper men
doing duty about the Federal building
of his seizure they immediately tele
phoned In to their respective offices for,
photographers, for the 'beautiful tablet
of green stone was a relic of more than
passing importance and it was a "good
story." The photographers were soon
on the scene, and* the precious tablet
was taken out on a back roof, where
the light would permit of its being pho
tographed. In the meantime the secre
tary to the Chinese legation had been
notified of the seizure and he had start
ed down to the Federa.1 building to re
claim the tablet for his Government.

Mr. Hearst also says that this intrusion was followed
by an incendiary dinner in New York on Saturday night,
at which Judge Parker sat down with Henry McDona

We don't know who McDona and Truax are, but doubt

sitting down with them. To an onlooker it appears that

The Californians in Congress are in
doubt as to what to do in the matter
of the military camp site awarded to
the Henry ranch by the Committee on
Military Affairs. They are disposed to
think that there has been some pecu
liar influence at work to have switched
the sentiment so suddenly from the
Nacimiento ranch and hurried the bill
through committee with a favorable
rt-port containing the name* of the
Henry ranch. They don't profess to
have any objection to the Henry ranch
particularly, except that It costs a hun
dred and fifty thousand dollars more
than the other, which the first military
board examining reported In favor of.
They do not believe that the matter
has been treated fairly. - Before the
committee they urged that in view of
the conflicting reports the matter of
selection be left to the â¢ Secretary of
War. But this suggestion was not only
not followed but the California site was
definitely fixed at the Henry ranch by
the language of the bill, while the loca
tions in the three other States were all
given at least the latitude that lies in
the words "at or near." Earlier In the
Ktf-t--i(ii) it was not 'deemed at all likely
that this bill would get on the calendar
of both houses this session. Now it ia
believed thÂ»re Is a possibility of Its
passage. They would like to offer an
amendment cutting out the name of
the ranch and inserting the names of
the three counties In which are located
the several sites inspected and reported
upon and leaving the definite selection
to the Secretary of War. But they fear
that by doing this they will be placing
a hindrance in the way of the bill's
passage. They want the camp site in
California and they want it this year.
The disposition to offer an amendment
thf-refore may be smothered.
So far as the House is concerned its
labors over the appropriation bills are
about over. Following the sundry civil
bill now under consideration comes the
last of the list, the general deficiency.
The House can then give itself over
to more interesting subjects, one of
which to many of its members Is ad
journment.
The Colorado River and its diversion
for irrigation has been before ' the
House Committee on Irrigation and
Arid I^ands for several days. William
C. Smythe of San Diego, Democrat and
late opponent of Captain Daniels for
Representative in Congress, has ap
peared in opposition to the bill. He
claims to come irt the Interest of the
people of California, who, he says, de
sire that the Government shall have
charge of the irrigation work of the
State. The closest and most persistent
questioning on the part of the chair
man of the committee has failed to dis
cover who is directly responsible for
his coming. He has waged a warm
fight on the bill, however, in whatever
interest it may be.

there was in assets $1,225,000 with
which to pay $1,033,000 in deposits.
National* Bank Examiner M. . R.
Sturtevant will arrive in the morning
to take charge of the bank.
The failure was caused by a heavy
drain during the last month and an
unexpected "run" this morning. Dur
ing the last month there was a shrink
age of deposits amounting to about
$500,000, and during the "run," which
commenced when the bank opened its
doors yesterday morning, more than
$100,000 was paid out. About noon it
was rumored that tnÂ« bank was going
under and eager depositors hurried to
the bank faster than during the morn-
Ing, and 'the president and directors,
seeing that the bank must go under,
closed the doors.
The suspension was caused indirectly
by the filing of a suit about three weeks
ago against the Holdenvllle National
Bank, of which Billirigsly is president,
and its failure last week. Although
the directors say that the depositors
will be paid in full, the stockholders

Th- joint Committee on Finance and
Fire of the Board of Supervisors held
a conference yesterday with the Fire
Commissioners and members of the
Board of Fire Underwriters relative to
taking steps for the better protection
of th? city from fire.
The first point considered was the
proposed extension of the fire limits.
Chief Sullivan favored the making of
Putter street the northerly limit, and
the underwriters advocated having it
extended to California street. Fire
Commissioner Boyne said the Fire
Commission was not prepared to make
any recommendation in that regard, as
it desired to Investigate the matter
more fully.
Charles D. Havens urged the com
mittee to extend the fire limits, but it
was decided to hold a special meeting
next Monday morning to take up that
phase of the question in all Its details.
The committee agreed that an aux
iliary salt water system and new water
hydrants are absolutely required. Dis
trict Chief Shaughnessy spoke of the
lack of water at the Baldwin Hotel fire
and said that a recurrence of that
fatality would be deplorable. He said
the salt water system contemplated the
installation of a distributing plant at
a point 750 feet above the sea level â
probably at Twin Peaks.
Commissioner Parry submitted a map
of the proposed system, which he said
would cost $350,000. It was also said
that 5000 additional hydrants should be
installed. :
It was decided that the boards of Fire
Wardens. Fire Underwriters and Fire
Commissioners meet jointly and agree
on a salt water system to cover the
business district and report to the Fin
ance Committee when It considers the
municipal budget next May. Chairman
Brandenstein stated that if the cost
did not exceed $150,000 the money might
be appropriated for the purpose.

Two former soubrettes of the "Foxy
Grandpa" comedy company and the
landlord of an Ellis-street apartment
house had the flocr of Fritz's court for
about fifteen "minutes yesterday .and
furnished entertainment for a large
audience.
William Eckhart, proprietor of the
Oriental Hotel, explained the case, and
the ex-soubrettes saw to it that no de
tails were overlooked. It was all about
a trunk and the contents thereof. While
the "Foxy Grandpa" company was en
gaged at one of the local theaters sev
eral months ago Miss May Gibson and
Mrs. Soule occupied a room at the Ori
ental, and when they departed -to
charm with their talents the one-night
stands on the southern circuit a single
trunk was left behind. Just \yhy it was
left behind does not matter.
Soon afterward Miss Gibson returned
to the city and claimed the trunk, and
when it was given to her by Mr. Eck
hart she removed It to another hotel.
Then a letter from Mrs. Soule, dated
Los Angeles, was received by Mr. Eck
hart, and it requested, him to hold the
trunk until she arrived and formally
took possession* of it. Mr. Eckhart,
considerably flurried, flew to the court
of Judge Fritz and obtained a warrant
empowering him to search Miss Gib
son's dwelling place and seize and hold
the trunk until such time as its owner
ship could be Judicially settled. So the
trunk was conveyed to the Hall of Jus
tice basement and there detained. Mrs.
Soule came from Los Angeles In time
to participate in the legal threshing
out of the dispute yesterday.
Neither of the women claimed sole
ownership of the trunk's contents, but
each of them asserted' that she had
"things" in it that she would not lose
for more than a trifle. Attorney Har
ris falteringly requested the ladies to
describe their respective shares of the
property, and as one of the ladies be
gan to do so the Judge blushed and,
glaring repri/vingly at the prosecuting
attorney, abrutly shut off the glibly
recited inventory by informing the con
testants that it would be easier 'for all
concerned if they were to step down
to the basement and privately divide
the treaeures in the trunk.
The suggestion was adopted, and as
the ladies did not reappear before the
bench it was inferred that they had
amicably adjusted their differences.
Attired in a sweeping gown of sil
very sheen. Miss Hattie Witzke of 30S
Minna street unsteadily approached the
bench of Judge Mogan and asked the
busy occupant thereof to sign a war
rant she had procured for the arrest of
two. persons, a man and a woman, on
a charge of grand larceny. As she re
cited the details of the alleged crime
she smiled with much sweetness at the
Judge, and he In return gazed with
attention at her beaming countenance
until he suddenly asked:
"How many drinks have you had to
day?"
"That's" not the question," said the
woman. "What' I want â "
"That is thÂ£ question and you can't
sidestep it, no matter what you may
want," persisted the court. "How
many drinks have you had to-day?"
"Well, I drank a glass of lemon
ade â "
"Anything in It besides lemon and
sugar?"
"No, sir. I never drink anything
stronger than lemonade."
"Well, my opinion is that you are in
toxicated, and I cannot issue a war
rant to an intoxicated person."
It subsequently developed that after
her visit to the Warrant Clerk and
prior to her visit to the court Miss
Witzke made several Journeys to the
street and that each excursion served
to enhance the spirit of sociability that
fairly exuded from her countenance
as she recounted her alleged grievance
to the Judge.

questing the court's permission to at
tend Jhe woman's funeral. The re
quest was promptly and emphatically,
refused.
"You shall get no such permit from
me," said the Judge, "not even if the
police are willing that you should at
tend the funeral of the woman you
murdered in cold blood."
The defendant's dejection visibly
deepened as the Judge's words were
uttered. Former Judge Sanderson, for
the defen/e, asked that the prelimi
nary examination be continued till
next Tuesday and the prosecution con
sented to the postponement. ./'
With a view of effecting the refor

described as "one of the Tehama

Briggs, engaged in philanthropic work,
had the lad arrested for disorderly
conduct and then ' deposited $5 bail
for his appearance yesterday morning
In Judge Fritz's court. When the case
was called George failed to respond,
and the Judge, not knowing that the,
complainant had furnished the bail,
ordered the $5 forfeited and a bench
warrant issued for the : boy's arrest.
It is likefy th,at some means will be
found by which Miss Briggs can be
refunded the money she put up and it
is also likely that George's act of in
gratitude will be suitably rewarded by
the court.

If the specific charge against Peck
Eppinger had been battery instead of
assault with a deadly weapon he would
not have been discharged yesterday, by
Judffe Fritz, for while the assault upon
Clerk Creco was proved, the character
of the weapon with which it was com
mitted "was left in doubt, some of the
witnesses declaring that it was a bot
tle, while others were as certain that
It was a seltzer siphon. A battery
charge has been entered by Greco and
will be heard to-day. ;'"3 ! .
A number of persons from Tehama
County appeared before Judge Caban
iss and corroborated much of the testi
mony adduced by sixteen-year-old An
nie Larsen, who accuses Milton Wald
stein of having induced her to leave her
home In this city and accompany him
to Redding.
Sheriff Boyd told of how he had ar
rested* the girl f.or vagrancy at Red
Bluff, after she had escaped from Red
ding, and of how "Waldstein had en
deavored to secure her release. Mrs. J.
A. Owen of Red Bluff, a benevolent
looking matron, testified that when she
heard of the girl's plight she paid the
fine imposed upon her for vagrancy
and then provided her with railroad
transportation to San Francisco >and
gave her $5 to defray traveling ex
penses. Constable Gumble of Corning
stated that he had been approached by
Waldstein, who was then seeking the
girl, and that Waldstein had represent
ed himself to be a professional detec
tive. Mrs. Larsen, the girl's mother,
informed the court that at. Waldstein's
request she had given him her daugh
ter's photograph and . certificate of
birth 1 to enable him to restore the girl
to her home.
Judge Cabanlss reserved his decision.
P. Marsicano, owner of the house at
1129 Dup'ont street, was before Judge
Fritz on a charge of letting his prem
ises for immoral purposes, and he asked
for and was given until Thursday to
plead. It Is understood that he â¢will
apply for a Jury trial, as he was con
victed once before by Judge Fritz on
the same charge.
Police Captain Duke is the complain
ing witness in the present case, which
is the outcome of Marsicano's neglect
to comply with a notice to quit the
premises or stop the immoral traffic
therein, which was served on him
March 7 * H. This notice was issued by
Justice of the Peace Dunn.
C. C. Chapel and E. J. Topple, able
seamen aboard the United States
steamship Pensacola, and Michael Sel
propp, a mariner whose home is the
United States revenue cutter Bear,
were fined $5 apiece by Judge Mogan
after he had heard of how the doughty
trio had put to rout about a dozen of
Uncle Sam's infantrymen that invaded
a Paciflc-stroet saloon last Saturday
night and disputed exclusive possession
thereof with the men of the sea.
Seaman Topple testified that the row
was started by his accidental stepping
upon the foot of a soldier, and that
when peace was restored the saloon
looked as If It had been the scene of a
dynamite explosion.
"How many soldiers did you ' and
your two companions defeat?" inquired
the Judge.
"Oh, about a dozen," modestly mur
mured Mr. Topple, glancing toward his
fellow-defendants for corroboration,
which they emphatically nodded.
"Even though you saw two objects
where only one existed the odds were
so heavily against you that I will fine
you only $5 apiece," said the court.
They paid the money.

Window-smashing is James Nash's
specialty when he is under alcoholic
influence, and the larger the pane the
more does he relish shattering it. Some
time ago he was heavily/ fined for
breaking a plateglass window of a
Market street shoe store,, and yester
day he was before Judge Mogan for
administering similar treatment to a
restaurant window on the same
thoroughfare. Pronounced guilty and
sentence reserved till to-day.
George Seth, accused of peddling
without a license, pleaded poverty
when arraigned before Judge Conlan,
but under sharp examination confessed
that he drops nickels in the seductive
slot machine and even takes an oc
casional flyer at the racing pools.
Fined $10.
' John Kilcline, another itinerant ven
der of fruit, refused to keep his wagon
moving and was arrested, and "when
he appeared before Judge Fritz for trial
his condition was such that the court
gave him twenty-four hours for drunk
enness Â¦ and continued the other case
until the defendant 18 sober enough to.
understand what it js all about.

strength and vainly endeavoring to

an exhibition of his Samsonian prowess
by plucking a door from its hinges and
Juggling it as if he were handling a

("I'm a carpenter ana I'll, fix the

Judge Fritz.
As the saloon man was willing to let
the case go at that so it went.

The Presbyterian ministers' meeting at
ihe Presbyterian house, 92(J Sacramento
street, yesterday morning.
Ivan B. Rhodes, secretary of the as

cially to speak of the religious life of
the students and the helpful influences
of hit organization,
Mr. Rhodes told his hearers that
among the athletes of the universities
Of the United States the most strenuous
Christians could be found â men that
wielded a powerful influence over the
freshmen. He showed the enormous
increase in the religious ardor of stu
dents as compared with generations
gone by.
He did not mean to criticize when he
said that Ihe professor of to-day had
n<> longer a parental relation to the stu
dent as formerly, for. at this age. the
professor was a heavily work-laden
man and when he went out of the col

to the student ceased.
There were, he said, at the present
lime about 75,000 students in the United
States united in the Toung Men's
Christian Association movement, and
the Bible was one of the great studies
with them.

The ordinance prohibiting the Tent
ing or leasing of buildings for Immoral
purposes was referred to the Judiciary
Committee. Â¦- -' *
In explanation of the amendment
Brandenstein said it was a well-known
fact that pools are beingsold- on races
outside the track inclosures and that
the present ; ordinance was being
evaded on the plea that cigar stores
were only receiving- the money to be
bet on the races and sending it to the
Oakland \ track. The amendment . was
designed to remedy a, defect, in. the.ex
isting law, under which it Is impossible
to secure conviction.
"It shall be' -unlawful for any per
son or. corporation to sell or buy pools
or make books or make or receive, as
principal or agent or^ otherwise, any
bet or wager whereby money or other
representatives of value, are staked or
pledged on races or other contests be
tween horses, except within the in
closure of a racÂ£ track, and only upon
horse races held within said inclosure
and conducted within the limit of forty
(40) days in .any one calendar year,
prescribed by section one (1) hereof."
The Board 'of Supervisors yesterday
referred to the joint Judiciary and Po
lice Committee, a proposed amendment
to ordinance 577, regulating and re
stricting horse -racing. . The .amend
ment provides that it shall be .unlaw
ful to sell pools thereon, except within
the inclosure where racing is carried
on. The amendment follows: Â¦ .

The Olympic Club, by W. G. Har
rison, president; and J. Elliott, secre
tary, sent a pommunication to the
board stating. that there is only one
amateur organizationâ the Pacific Ath
letic Association â which has control of
amateur sports in this city. The, com
munication is relative to an effort made
by an organization of four clubs to
have the ordinance regulating amateur
boxing amended so that clubs belong
ing to any amateur organization may
secure permits for exhibitions.
The communication states that the
Olympic Club does not consider the
four clubs In Question as amateur,
claiming they are interested In boxing
purely for the profit therein, and If
there be any more than one central
ized body to govern the amateur
sports, amateurism in San Francisco
will become a farce.
Supervisor Buxton opposed the
amendment, holding that control
should not be taken away from the
Pacific association, while Braunhart
wanted light on the alleged Superior
Court decision that the Supervisors
had no legal right to designate what
association amateur clubs shall belong
.to. Eggers said the decision was platn
on its face and charged that the Pa
cific association had violated the rules
.by allowing trophies valued; In excess
of the legal amount to be given to con
testants, but the latter statement was
denied by George James. Supervisor
Brandenstein held that Eggers* charge
required that an investigation be held,
which was ordered.
The amendment increasing the value
of trophies that may be allowed to con
testants from $15 to $35 was passed
to print.
The resolution granting the Bay City
Club a permit for % an amateur exhibi
tion on April 6, which had been set
aside, pending the settlement of the dis
pute, was adopted, as the club has been
put to some expense for the same.
Representatives of the Pacific assa
ciation objected to the amendment and
the newly organized California Ama
teur Association, composed of the Bay
City, Hayes Valley, Lincoln and S^an
Francisco clubs, which have withdrawn
from the first named organization,
spoke in favor of it, as it would give
the California association, jurisdiction
In the matter.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
reref erred to the Police Committee an
amended ordinance to regulate amateur
boxing exhibitions by .eliminating the
section requiring amateur clubs to be
long, to the Pacific Athletic Association
and substituting therefor a provision
that clubs belonging to "any amateur
organization" may secure boxing per
mits. I '
Action was taken on a charge made
by Supervisor Eggers that the asso
ciation named had permitted the ama
teur rules to be violated.
Schreck put on the finishing touches
to his training yesterday and is confi
dent of his ability to take tire Califor
nian's measure. He appears to be in
fine form and claims to have had no
trouble in making weight. The men
will weigh in at Harry Corbett's at 3
o'clock to-day. They are to fight at 153
pounds.
Like Seiger, Schreck can boast of
never having been put down for the
count, but it remains to be seen wheth
er his next fight will be with Joe Wol
cott or some preliminary.
! Biddy Bishop asserted last night that
his man had injured his right arm in
training, but that It would undoubtedly
be In form for to-night's go. He Is loud
in- his praises of the Chicago man's
ability, and fails to see why the odds
should be as they are.
While Woods" is generally "acknowl
edged by fighting fans to be a great
fighter, wi$h a terrific punch In either
hand and as fast as a streak of light
ning, there are many that are wonder
ing whether he will lose his head and
fight wild when up against a man that
equals him in ability. Still, again, there
are others that are fostering suspicions
that a second Charlie Selger is about
tc be introduced to the coast.
Betting on to-night's fight between
Billy Woods of Los Angeles and Mike
Schreck of Chicago is not as brisk as
might have been expected, and though
there has been a large advance sale of
seats and the local man I3 favorite
at 10 to 7. It is evident that sports
are not sure enough of thely man's
chances to back him with their coin.

Charley McCafferty bid Constellator
up from $400 to ?S0O and secured the
gelding. *-
The California Jockey Club has set
aside Aorll 23 for Fabiola day. A race
for gentlemen riders will be one of the
features.
All that kept the backers of Cousin
Carrie â equal favorite for the mile
event with Reeves â from cashing was
the half-hearted ride she received.
Vanderbout had the leg up on the
mare, and after losing ground enough
on the stretch turn for a baseball park
was beaten out a length by My Sur
prise, a 5 to 1 chance. Shell Mount
came very fast from the rear, taking
the Fhow from Puss in Boots and los
ing the place by only a nose. Boriner
on Reeves gave a weird exhibition.
Constellator looked the class of thfe
mile and a sixteenth number, and.
if ready, 2',& to 1 appeared a liberal
quotation. Well, he was ready, receiv
ed strong support, and had the race
won from the time Dick Dwyer sprung
the barrier. Idogo, the runner up all
the way, experienced no trouble in dis
posing of Polonius for the place.
Nothing but the lethargic ride of
Bonner prevented Rey Dare, the favor
ite, from getting some portion of the
last purse. If Bonner was dealing out
his best, then he has forgotten how to
ride, <and the judges should set him
down for incompetency. Horton and
Pierce J, two other well-played ones,
also ran poorly. Scherzo suddenly re
covered his best form, and, pounded
down from 10 to 6 and 7, won all the
way in boat-race fashion with Knapp
at the helm. Laocoon, another rank
outsider, downed George Berry, a 12 to
1 chance, for the place. Â«
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
North West, the 13 to 5 favorite,
made a runawav race of the opening
six-furlong sprint. She was ridden by
"Big Bill" Knapp and, jumping away
in front, won galloping at the close,
ten lengths before Lady Atheling.
Dusty Miller ran third.
It was due to Powell's good hand
ling more than anything else that en
abled Bob Ragron to beat the favorite
Del Carina for the two-years-old
scramble. He hustled the Kismet colt
away from the barrier in the lead and,
putting up a strong finish at the end,
crossed the line half a length ahead
of the first choice. Otis on Marie J
took show honors. Mildred B showed
some earlv speed, then retired.
Possibly Willie See did the best he
could '.with Divina, the coast mile
ord holder, in the mile and a sixteenth
purse selection at Oakland yesterday.
But the betting looked bad and
Willie's effart warse. The mare
opened at 8 to 5 and went to 12 to 6,
with some of the pencilers laying 4 to 6
a place in a five horse race. The In
side money was bet on Ben Macbhul,
which, with Bonner up. made all the
running and was never even hailed.
See ran Into squalls, punctured a tire,
was twice in danger of foundering, had
his rudder chain broken, narrowly es
caped a collision with Carat, blew out
a fuse, ran short of matches and even
lost the place. to G. W. Trahern, a 16
to 1 Ehot. by a head. It was certainly
one of Willie's star performances, and
he scored some sreat hits last sum
mer during the matinees given at the
Seattle merry-go-round.
There are two or three riders at
Oakland that need grilling and the
sooner the judges do it, the better the
sport will be. In fact they would not
be missed frorn , the turf altogether.
The racing yesterday resulted In the
overthrow of three favorites.

Arrives From South Accom
panied hy Mother and the
Gallant Captain Collins
Miss Natalie Schenck, one of the
fairest belles of Newport society, who
has frequently attracted public atten
tion by her interesting whims, accom
panied by her mother, Mrs. Spotworth
Schenck, arrived here yesterday and is
registered at the St. Francis. Immedi
ately under the signatures of the young
lady and her mother on the hotel regis
ister is that of Captain Glen Collins, a
retired officer of the Cameron High
landers of the British army, with
whose name the young woman's has
recently been associated in reports to
the effect that they are engaged and
that their visit to California will be
followed by a wedding at Newport dur
ing the latter part of this month.
Captain Collins accompanied Mrs.
Schenck and her charming daughter to
the coa?t and has been their guardian
during a short stay at Monterey. In
the East, especially at Lakewood, New
port and other resorts where the more
select srts bide their time in summer.
Miss Schenck is always the center of
an admiring group. It was but a few
months ago that the report gained cir
culation that she was to marry Eugene
HIgrgins, but it developed latter that
this story grew out of the fact that the
your.g woman and her mother had been
the guests of Mr. Higgins on his yacht
on a trip across the Atlantic.
Just previous to this report society at
the fashionable watering places had It
that Miss Schenck was to become the
viff of T. Suffern Taller, but like many
other stories of a similar character it
was soon met with an emphatic denial
from the Intimate friends of the young
woman. Mi?s Schcnck's acquaintance
with Captain Collins dates back to her
voyage across the Atlantic on the Hlg
gins yacht, aboard which was also the
gallant British officer.
During the Spanish-American war
Miss Schonck gained considerable fame
by arranging an endless chain of cor
respondence with her grirl friends with
a view of securing contributions for a
fund with which to build an ice house
for the Red Cross Society. The popu
larity of the scheme grew to such an
extent that the postoffice at Babylon,
L. I., was flooded with mall, and even
tually Mies Schenck was forced to ap
peal to the Associated Press to afford
her relief by announcing to the country
at large that * further contributions
were not desired.

Report That Rock Island
Wants Southern Pacific
Officials Is Confirmed
Alleges That He Once Drew
Revolver arid Threatened
to Murder Her Outright
Suit for divorce was filed yesterday
by Rose B. Gillingham against William
Gillingham en the ground of cruelty.
She claims that during the last four
years her husband has abused her and
used profane and indecent language to
ward her, ayd that on one occasion
he drew a revolver and threatened to
take her life. S .
The Gillinghams were married in Los
Angeles on August 24, 1891. Not long
after their x marriage he began to show
signs of extreme jealousy and often
accused her of infidelity, she^alleges.
For the last few years the pair has
lived at 1816 Pine street, where, the
plaintiff alleges, she has kept the en
tire family, including her child, her
husband's child and himself by money
she earned in the capacity of divine
healer and spiritual reader. She claims
that her lectures and readings at 1292
Howard street have netted her about
$150 a month.
Several months ago, it is claimed by
the plaintiff, her husband wrote her a
letter to the effect that he was going
out of town on business and would be
away several days. - It developed later,
she says, that he had merely written
the letter as a ruse and that he was
In town all the while, securing the ser
vices of detectives, who watched her
movements in an endeavor to catclfher
visiting other men.
Mrs. Gillingham claims that at the
conclusion of/ one of her meetings on
Howard street she was addressed by
an elderly man, who claimed to be
wealthy, and offered her $500 to cure
him of stomach trouble, lie told her
he would not go to her residency,' for
treatment, but asked her to treat him
at his rooms at 459 Geary street. This
the woman refused to do, but finally
assented, with the understanding that
her sister accompany her to the rooms.
No sooner had she called at the rooms
of her patient than her husband knock
ed on the door and demanded admit
tance. He was accompanied by a third
person, who, the plaintiff claims, was
the detective.
The plaintiff further claims that her
spouse was in the habit of visiting .mu
tual friends and defaming her char
acter to* such an extent that she was
soon looked upon by them as an im
moral woman. One day, she says, he
pulled her nose, told her she was crazy
and tried to throw her downstairs over
the banisters.
Suits? for divorce were filed by Harry
Rea against Dora Rea on the ground
of desertion, Dorothy Logan against
George T. Logan fc-r' failure to provide
and desertion. Sarah E. Mad len against
John C. Mndden for failure to provide,
Edith Olsen' against" Goel Olsen for
cruelty, Harry M. Saunders against
Eleanor Saunders^for desertion and
Delia B. King against Clarence King
for extreme cruelty.
Anita S. Miner was granted a divorce
from Ellmere F. Miner in Judge
Troutt's court on the ground of will
ful neglect.

Discover t>en the Slightest
Trace of Rain.
Professor McAdie is deeply engaged
in trying to fathom the mystery of
yesterday's pleasant weather. The
'; iosest inspection of the gauges failed
to reveal the slightest trace of rain.
ThÂ» sisns last night indicated a con
tinuation of fair weather, but even
meteorological portents are not always
rr-Mable. " "
The March map shows that not a
trace of rain was seen at Needles,
Bernardino County, during the
month. At other points, however, the
moisture was excessive. Plumas. Las
cen and Nevada counties report an
enormous rainfall. At L.a Porte there
was more than fiv'e feet of rain during
l-Vbruary and Maivh. Rov.tnans Dam
imports r.early four feet of rainfall for
February, but the observer has not
strewed up his courage to the point
v.hore he dare 3emi in the March re
port as yet. F.ear Valley. Brush Creek,
Kentfleld and Bransrom all report a
phenomenally heavy rainfall.*
McAdie has just returned from a
trip up the Sacramento River for the
Kdrpose of securing scientific informa
tion in regard lo the recent flood. He

voyant reading. He asks you no questions,
' but tells you what you, wish to know.

fortunes you are heir to; You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you." find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy. : '

thinking Stenslund had decided to re
main ashore all night, turned in. When
the towboat came alongside next morn
ing the skiff in which Captain Stens
lund had rowed ashore was found fast
to the Big Bonanza's gangway. On
the gangway was a bundle of the cap
tain's clothes, as he had got them from
the laundry.
Captain Stenslund evidently reached
the ship all right and made^ fast the
painter of the skiff. Just what hap
pened afterward probably never will be
known. There was a terrific current
rushing by the ship and a human being
once In that swirl of water would have
small chance of escape from death. It
is thought that Stenslund, in making
fast the painter, lost his balance, fell
overboard and was carried away by
the torrent.
Captain Charles Stenslund, com
mander of the ship Big Bonanza, has
disappeared, and there seems little rea
son to doubt that at some hour between
5 o'clock Saturday afternoon and 5
o'clock Sunday morning he was
drowned. The Big Bonanza wintered
at an anchorage off Antioch. Captain
Stenslund and a sailor, Peter Carmelo,
lived on board and looked out for the
vessel during the time she was laid up.
Alexander Young joined the vessel on
Saturday as mate and with F. Parker,
a seaman, was to have helped Captain
Stenslund and Sailor Carmelo get the
ship ready for the towboat which on
Sunday was to take the Big Bonanza
from her winter quarters to Beale
street wharf, there to be made ready
for a voyage to Alaska for salmon.
During his stay at Antioch Captain
Stenslund made many friends ashore,
and at 5 o'clock Saturday afternoon
| left the ship for, the purpose of bidding
good-by to his winter-time acquaint
ances.

NEW YORK. April 4. â Speculators who have
been trifling for two weeks in the confident be
*litf that they knew the inside facts of the
Northern Securities settlement were nonplused
to-dar by th* terras of the petition of the
\;nlon Pacific interest* for aa injunction
cjr-iinst the distribution of Northern Securities
Â¦ sseta oa the plan proposed. It has been ex
.X>e<-t*4 that some judicial opinion would be in
vited on the proposed plan, but the question
of legality In the substitution of collateral for
the Northern Securities stock now held against
the Oregon Short Line bond issue waa the only
one which has been admitted to be an issue, in
view of the protestations from all interests
concerned that perfect unity and harmony ex
isted. But a perusal of the petition makes so
strong an impression of a conflict of hostile in
trreets- that sentiment in the stock market was
upeft. So far :rom an appearance of resigna
tion to the community of Interest In control
of Northern Pacific, the Union Pacific's conten
tion in&cated a> determination to conserve Jts
control of the Northern Pacific line secured in
1801 at sucb disastrous consequences to the
stock tnarkrt In reners.1. This condition was
â¢o at variance with V he Impression industri
ously cultivated In the ato?k market for the
last two weeks that apprehension of a conflict
between the <wo powerful rivals which might
extend to the securities mirket was revived.
'The eupponitloRt used to explain the recent
large buying of Union Pacific were decided to
be grmindlee* and the (surmises of the market
ktiifted back to the hypothesis of competitive
buylna tor control. Demand for Union Pacific
was asraln conspicuous to-day and carried the
price at one time aa high as 90. The atock's
*-a!n on the day was 3U on total sales of 1S9.
810 shares. It was or.!y momentarily below
Saturday's cloae on the reaction which fol
lowed the opening bnlre. and was carried
hlirher by successive buying orders. The
opening break In the general list wan partly
repalred in sympathy with. the first strength of
Union Pacinc. bat the persistence and the vol
ume of the demand for that stock awakened
the fears of the traders and the general list
wa* fitnrgloh and heavy for the rest of the day.
Â«. Pad waa tnoÂ«t acutely affected by the
openlnr break. aÂ» It has been most actively
Â¦peculated In on the unwarranted assumption
of the coora* Â«f the Northern Securities settle'

Provisions.
CHICAGO, April 4.â Prospects of rain caus
ed general veiling of wheat to-day. All cereals
closed weak, July wheat being down lÂ«Â»@l^ie;
corn was off l@lVic. and oats show a less
of l*gc. Provisions closed 20@22Hc higher. '
Predictions of favorable weather caused a
bearish sentiment In the wheat pit at the
opening. The July delivery was Vi@Vic to
ViÂ®*Â»c lower at 87 \* to S7%c. For a time the
market- held around the opening uguree, but
lack of any strong support soon began to be
felt and prices started downward. The fact
that foreign grain markets were closed to-day
tended to restrict the volume of trading, as
did the approaching holiday here toi-morrow.
The absence of the usual activity In the pit.
in itself, was a depressing influence. Weak
ness in a!l cash grains, after recent strength.
took any remaining enthusiasm out of the
bulls and caused considerable liquidation of
lour wheat. The declines in Northwestern
niÂ«iketÂ« were another element In the situation
that encouraged sellers. Pit traders hammered
tht- market persistently throughout the day,
notwithstanding the moderately bullish crop
rei>crts from Missouri and Ohio. Final quo
tations on July were at fc69Â»,c. after the price
hs-d touched SC'4c May ranged between JH' 3 c
and Miic closing at Â»4%c. .
The early corn market was steady on a
moderate commission houso demand, but
toward the r.<x>n hour avselling movement set
In that caused s. severe break.' July opened
tnrhan-ed to >*& %c lower at 53V4(Â£53V(iC t-J
53H.C After selling between 52Â»Â«c and 53%c
the clone was at 5-%@52%c. May ranged be
tv/een 55 Vic and 57^c and closed at oOc.
The owt market was subjected to a raid
early in the session, heavy selling of the May
option by rit traders and commission houses
causing much weakness. The close was weak
and at the bottom. After opening %QK t c
lower at 3!Â»%Â®:iyi4c July sold between 38c
and SO^c and closed at .ISc. May ranged be
tween 3Â»%c and 4iaiÂ©41%c. closing at 39%c.
Provisions were weak under the Influence of
liberal erlllng by packers. A marked In
crease in contract stocks of pork and â¢ lard
was the principal cause of the selling pres
sure, although the weakness In grains had
some effect. Covering by shorts checked the
declining tendency. The market, closed easy
with July pork down 2Otfj22VÂ»c; July lard was
off 7>^Â«^10c, and ribs closed 10c lower.

H. C. Ford, in 1898 a clerk at the
ferry postofflce, gave some unimrjort
ant testimony regarding the manner of
handling packages and a conversation
held with John P. Dunnigan, the man
who claimed to have noticed the pack
age of candy in the mails on August 4,
1898, addressed to Mrs. John P. Dun
ning, Dover, Del. This morning the
defense will introduce , its . remaining
witnesses, which will close the case
from Mrs. Botkin's standpoint. Â¦
The defendant kept proceedings
waiting for a few minutes yesterday
by reason of her tardiness. Evidently
the strain ia telling on her, as she
was more ; excitable and nervous than
at any previous hearing, even when
the , prosecution was bringing -out its
full array of damaging circumstances.

edly the hit of the defense. Presum
ably he is a disinterested . party,
friendly to the Pennington f ami ly and
to the physicians who testified against
the" defendant. The fact that the
candy in evidence and alleged' y : to
have been sent by Mrs. Botkin in ;this
city to Mrs. Dunning.never came into
the' view; of the Coroner- until i inter
ested parties had secured . an analysis
of it and kept it in their possession
for one week before submitting it to
the Coroner's Jury, .'andj the r further
fact that^ the Coroner where , the crime
is alleged to have been committed
never had .the candy, [in his official
possession, must undoubtedly ' strike; a .
San Francisco Jury as peculiar, in mur
der," proceedings -*
The remaining proceedings 'Â¦ of the
day were prolific of nothing in the way
of advantage to either side. . At the
close it was announced that, the- de
fense would conclude introducing tes
timony at noon to-day,: and the prose-,
cution agreed that;its rebuttal could
be put in during, the afternoon, j The
opening argument of the prosecution
will occupy most of Wednesday morn
ing and the- defense promises to con
clude'in the afternoon. On; Thursday
morning the prosecution will conclude
its argument and Judge Cook believes
that -the' issue, will be submitted tojthe
Jury by Thursday afternoon, v --
: This promise of an early conclusion
of the trial is refreshing in contrast to
the '.'. last hearing ; of the ' accusation
against Mrs. Botkin, when the defense
dragged out one weary week in the
production of unimportant
events in connection with ; the. case.
So far in this trial there has. been
nothing startling adduced by- the de
fense aside^ from, the opening testi
mony of the'defendant while, on the
stand and 'the reading of the' deposi
tion of ex-Coroner Walls, .formerly
and at the time of the alleged mur
ders acting in, his official capacity, at
Dover, Delaware. . "O.
EARLY CLOSE PROMISED.
To the wadijig of this the defense' in
terposed an objection, as being incom
petent, irrelevant and immaterial, and
the court took the matter -under ad
visement. It is particularly important
to the prosecution to have this verdict
go into the record, as Dr. Bishop's tes
timony was anything but convincing
regarding the cause of the deaths,. and
Dr." Downs only saw Mrs. Dunning a
few hours. before her demise. The de
fense has all along maintained theories
of ptomaine poisoning, deaths from
natural causes; indiscriminate handling
for days and even months of candy al
leged to have been poisoned by Mrs.
Botkin, and a 'general desire' to fasten
the crime on her by the, police' of -this
city and by the Delaware authorities to
vindicate themselves in the face of
public sentiment
way for identification?" was asked. ,
'â¢Never," was the answer. "I saw a
box of candy on the table during the
inquest, but did not handle it or mark
it for identification."
"To . whom was this candy turned
over at the conclusion of the. inquest."
"I do not know of my own knowl
edge." ' . .
The only question asked in the depo
sition by the prosecution was:
"What was the verdict of the.Coro
ner's inquest on the deaths of Mrs.
Dunning and Mrs. Deane?".

Walls' testimony is new on this
-rial, not having been > introduced at
the last hearing, and disinterested at
-.orneys who attended the session yes
terday when it' was read thought it
was the strongest piece of evidence
so far adduced by the defense.
The only witness \ who 'contributed
any. particular interest to the day's
proceedings was Dr. George W. Terrill, i
who has offices, at 121 Geary street. He j
testified on. direct examination that he j
visited Mrs. Botkin _ on the . afternoon
of July 31,-1898,; between the 'hours of
3 and 5 o'clock and found her. suffering. J
from a severe headache and agener-;
ally bilious condition: 'She ; was lying!
on a couch and- wearing a yellow!
wrapper. He fixed the date as' he did;
because he had ..performed- a surgical)
operation on i the same date and en- |
tered it on. his book. Following the'
operation he returned to his office at i
2 o'clock, as was his custom on Sun- |
days, and there .- received a telephone |
call to attend Mrs. Botkin at the Vic
toria Hotel. . ' .
On*, cross-examination r the deadly i
record of the previous was cited
for Doctor Terrill and he wandered off
in the land of doubt as readily, as he j
had testified to the date and hours six j
years previous. The hours and the
date" in question *are particularly im
portant to the | prosecution, /as it was
on July 31, between 4 and 5 o'clock .
in the afternoon, that Mrs. .Botkin is ;
alleged to have purchased the box of j
candy from Haas & Son's, which was
subsequently poisoned and sent from I
this cityr to Mrs. Dunning at Dover.
After reviewing his testimony at the
former trial, j the V witness admitted
many indefinite impressions of the
facts and generally failed to be con-'
vlnclng. Particularly so was he-in his
statement"; that, althoush .he made a
practice â¢ of entering in . a â¢ book every
visit he paid. to a patient, he had failed
to discover any, caliche made on Mrs.

"At any time before, during, or after
the inquest was a box of candy alleged
to have been. poisoned ever. In your, of
ficial custody or marked by you' in any
On Tuesday, the deponent ' testified,
he met Dr. Bishop and was Informed
by him that the box of candy partaken
of by Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane had
been ascertained by Professor Wolfe of
the Delaware State University to have
been full of arsenic This was the first
time that any direct mention of ' the
candy had been" made to the deponent.
Later that . evening he . called ; at the
Pennington # home In company with
Charles Morris, one . of the \ Jurors and
cashier of the Farmers' Bank of Dover.
Pennington. produced a box of candy al
leged to have been received by Mrs.
Dunning one week before and handed
it into the custody of Morris.
NOT IX CORONER'S CARE.
On the Monday following, the de
ponent testified. Dr. Bishop informed
him that he deemed an inquiry neces
sary, and a list of jurors was furnished
the deponent, either by Dr. Bishop or
Lenrehan, the undertaker" in charge of
the bodies, . with the statement, that
they had been prepared by John P.
Pennington, father of the dead women,
and that he was satisfied with the
names presented. The Jury was then
summoned and viewed the bodies on
that day. ' V -
At that" time Dr. Bishop stated that
he had not fully concluded whether or
not their deaths were due to ptomaine
or arsenical poisoning. He admitted
that he had neglected to treat either of
his patients for the latter trouble until
It was too late to prevent the lethal
absorption of the poison by their sys
tems.
Nothing impressive was developed by
the defense in the Botkin case yester
day except the deposition of William
David Walls, now a resident of Jersey
City, N. J., and during the year 189S
Coroner of Kent County, Delaware, in
which the city of Dover is situated. ' It
was there on August 9 of that year, it
is charged, that Mrs. Dunning and
Mrs. Joshua D. Deane partook of a box
of poisoned candy sent them from this
city by Mrs. Cordelia Botkin and died
from the effects. For sending this
candy to Mrs. Dunning's address Mrs.
Botkin is now on her second trial on
a charge of murder. Her first trial re
sulted in conviction and sentence to life
imprisonment, which verdict was re
versed by the Supreme Court of this
State on technical grounds.
Ex-Coroner Walls' affidavit was as
much a vindication of the defendant
as an official occupying his position at
that time could extend after a jury
over which he presided had rendered a
verdict that the death of the twp
women was due to arsenical poisoning.
His affidavit was apparently intend
ed by the defense to establish a failure
of the prosecution to prove the corpus
delicti in both cases, and to that end
the interrogatories of the defense were
admirably framed. Walls testified that
he voluntarily went to Dr. Bishop on
the day following the death of Mrs.
Dunning and suggested to him that in
view of the fact that there was a great
deal of talk regarding the cause of
Mrs. Dunning's and Mrs. Deane's death
It might be advisable to hold an In
quest.

The band of the Philippine Scouts re
turned yesterday morning from its
concert tour down the bay. It played
at Redwood City Saturday night. Palo
Alto on Sunday afternoon and San
Jose on Sunday evening. As the band
had only been advertised a day ahead
of performances the attendance was
light and the trip was not as big a
financial success as had been anticipat

pave great satisfaction. It will play
again in San Jose next Saturday night.
The much discussed question of the
change in base of the coast artillery
companies stationed at the Presidio
and at Honolulu has been finally set
tled. Word came from the War De
partment yesterday that the Twenty
eighth and Ninety-second companies,
now at the post here, are to sail for
Honolulu on the transport Thomas,
which is scheduled to leave on Satur
day, April "0. They will take the place
of the Sixty-sixth and Sixty-seventh
companies, now at Honolulu. These
two companies are ordered to sail for
this rort on the transport Sherman,
vhirh is scheduled to leave Manila on
April 15. She should arrive at Hono
lulu about May 4 and should be due
here about the middle of May.
The Twenty-eighth ar.d Ninety-eec
tmd companies have been stationed
here for two years and have made
many acquaintances afnong the town
folks. Lieutenant and Mrs. Victor C.
Lewi?, vho have entertained exten
sively at the :>0Et. will be greatly

Major Biselow has arranged another
regulation problem exercise for his
squadron ol the Ninth Cavalry, to take
place on the golf lir.ks and vicinity to
morow morning: ftt S:30 o'clock. Like its
predecessors, it will be full of interest
ing end exciting features, and will be
instructive as well as amuFing to the
onlooker.
The colored troops are now in fine
condition, and as the rair.s have ceased
the golf grounds are in excellent shape,
so that the review, which is to follow
the early maneuvers, will show up to
preat advantage. The review wiil proba
bly take place shortly before 10 o'clock,
so that those who do not care to rise
early can take advantage of the second
part of the nrogjamme. As Major
Bigelow expects to be soon transferred
to Ord Barracks, this will probably be
one of the last of the exercises under
his command.
Captain Martin attributes the crime
to a- gang of ex-convicts he says has
been working in the North Beach sec
tion of the city for some timer
Hartman thought he had a clew to
the perpertators of the crime and
worked all day yesterday to locate the
suspects. Last night he reported the
matter, to Captain Martin and special
detectives were detailed on the case.
Burglars looted the saloon of Marcus
Hartman, northeast corner of Pacific
and Stockton streets, early, yesterday
morning. They stole the contents of
the cash register, $56, and a quantity
of liquors and cigars. . - -
Hartman closed his saloon yesterday
morning at 2 o'clock and took partic
ular pains to see that all of the win
dows and doors were locked.- When he
opened the front door "in the morning
he was surprised to find that the cash
register was gone from . the shelf be
hind the bar. Search revealed the reg
ister in a small back room off the bar
room. It had been broken open by the
crooks and everything in the shape- of
money extracted from it. ;
The burglars gained entrance by cut
ting the lock off a wooden skylight
frame and removing tnree large iron
bars that stretched across the opening.
They lowered themselves through the
aperature and ransacked the place. A
large new steel "jimmy" was left lying
on the bar by the burglars. The police
believe that they must have, been
frightened away before they completed
the crime, or they would not have left
the ."jimmy."
They took the register into the back
room, it is presumed, so that the night
bartender, who lived next door, might
not hear the bell ring wnen the box
was opened. Several boxes of choice
cigars and bottles of whisky were
taken.
Mr. Lackmann's testimony, which
corroborated that of United States Se
cret Service Agent Burns, was cor
roborated by that of United States
Marshal Shine, who added that Dasha
was not in custody at the time he con
fessed, but after the confession had
been made the witness placed Dasha
under arrest.
Mr. Lackmann told about the con
fessions made bv Dasha and Demp
sey In the Russ House last September
in the presence of himself, United
States District Attorney Woodworth,
United States Marshal ' Shine and
United States Secret Service Agents
William J. Burns and Harry Moffltt.
An effort was. made by Dasha's coun
sel to show that Burns had cursed
Dasha and called him a liar just be
fore he made the confession, but the
witness testified that Mr. Burns did
not call Dasha a liar and did not use
any violent or profane language. The
witness then related that Dasha ad
mitted having participated in ten or
twelve instances of substituting Chi
nese prisoners and had been paid for
doing so. The witness^ told also about
Dempsey having confessed to the re
ceipt of $25 at one time and. $30 at
another from Dasha and Burnett.
The taking of testimony in the case
of the United States; vs. W. F. Dasha.
T. J. Dempsey and Horn Toon, charged
with conspiracy to land Chinese ille
gally, was concluded yesterday after
noon in the United States District
Court and counsel proceeded with their
arguments to the Jurv. , United States
District- Attorney Woodworth will
make the closing argument on behalf
of the Government at 11 o'clock this
morning.
The session of yesterday began at 2
p. m. and only two witnesses for the
Government, former Sheriff John Lack
mann and United States Marshal John
H. Shine, were examined. This closed
the Government's side of the case.
None of the defendants were called to
the witness stand, but A. B. Potter,
Louis Lyser and Gus Pohlmann, the
latter a former member Qf the Legis
lature of this State, testified that the
general reputation of Dasha for truth,
honesty and integrity was good.
