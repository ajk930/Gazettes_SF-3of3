A high official of the Ministry of Marine has informed the Matin that
there has been -no betrayal of French naval secrets. The. facts 'which gave
rise to the story are aa follows: A certain non-commissioned officer was
placed under arrest charged with serious neglect of duty. As he was re
ported to have associated with suspicious an investigation was
made and it was ascertained that. he had indulged in clandestine .betting.
The Figaro this morning gives prominence to the. recital of an alleged
attempt to sell French naval secrets to Japan. v . According.- to the Figaro
Btory, a certain non-commissioned officer has been arrested, and the paper
alleges that a woman also is concerned. It adds that one important
document is missing.
The Figaro publishes a dispatch from St. Petersburg, saying that Gen
eral Kuropatkin will leave Moscow for the Far East on Sunday evening.
He will travel on an ordinary express train as far as Irkutsk, but from
there he will go in a special. His final destination is kept secret, as it is
connected with mobolization plans.
PARIS, March 10.â The St. Petersburg correspondent of the Journal
telegraphs that it is affirmed that the Grand Duchess Olga, sister of the
Czar, is going out to Manchuria to act as superintendent of the Red Cross
work. : .
LONDON, March 10.â All Europe is anxiously awaiting news of the naval
engagement which reports from Tokio declare has already occurred in the sea
of Japan between the division commanded by Admira^ Uriu and the Russian
Vladivostok squadron. A variety of rumors regarding the fate of the Russian
cruisers came from different sources yesterday, but none of them was au
thenticated. ' One was to the effect that the Russian ships had been seen far
to the southward of Possiet Bay and were believed to be tempting a dash
around the southern coast of Korea to effect a juncture with the fleet in the
harbor at Port Arthur. This is scarcely regarded as probable, although re
cent activity on the Port Arthur ship3 has led to the belief that some sortie
was being planned, such as in all likelihood would be necessary to assist in
the attempt of the Vladivostok squadron to reach Port Arthur. *
Tokio is firmly of the belief that Admiral Uriu has already destroyed the
Russian ships. The Japanese commander has orders to put in at Wusan and
report upon the. outcome of his mission as soon as the enemy's squadron has
been taken care of. Â¦ .
Under date of March 9 a correspondent of the Times at Tokio says the
Russian advance south of Possiet Bay continues.'
During the discussion of the army estimates in the House of Com
mons last night Premier Balfour said that so long as the army home de
fenses were maintained in an adequate condition any invasion of this coun
try by an organized force capable. of reducing it to submission was merely
a dream. But no man could blind himself to the fact that circumstances
in the Far East were making Great Britain a great continental power and
these circumstances must be taken into account in i framing, the British
army estimates. (

SAN JOSE, 'March 9,-rCity Treasurer
Thomas J. McGeoghegan is short more
than $7000 in his accounts with the
city and he is in the custody of a
Pinkerton detective, practically a prls
â¢oner. ..The money Is believed to have
Â¦beÂ«ni.JaH5n-.irpin r the ..city tunds* be
tween January 15 and January 31. This
is the statement given out by the rep
resentatives of the surety coriipanies
on his bond for J100.000. The past two
days there have been all sorts of ru
mors afloat in regard to the shortage
in McGeoghegan's office. It was placed
as high as $10,000 and upon the other
hand McGeoghegan and hi3 friends de
clare it all was right and that no mon
ey was missing. Wine, women and
gambling are said to be responsible
for the defalcation.
About the first of this month a report
of McGeoghegan's actions reached the
offices of the surety companies on his
bond and a week ago J. H. Robertson,
general agent of the United States Fi
delity and Guaranty Company at San
Francisco, and F. B. Lloyd, general
agent of the American Bonding Com
pany of Baltimore, came to this city
to investigate his accounts. Each com
pany is on his bond for $50,000. The
books and accounts of the office were
found in a bad shape. Accounts were
entangled and the books had not been
posted since February 1. Since then
the two men have been at work upon
the books. Thts evening they an
nounced they had found a shortage of
more than $7000.
Charles J. Keane and Charles J.
Lightston are exporting the books for
Mayor Worswick and it is expected
they will have a report ready to-mor
row.
ACCOUNTS *ARE 3ITDDLED.
In an interview this evening Lloyd
said:
"Our attention was called to the life
McGeoghegan was leading and th* bad
condition of the books in his office. We
find that he is short more than $7000.
From our examination we think the en
tire sum was taken, between the 15th
and 31st of January. It was taken from
the money collected for municipal
licenses, and the accounts of the office
on February 1, that is for the month
of January, were falsified to hide the
shortage. McGeoghegan had collected
during January for 183 licenses on slot
machines at $20 each. $3260, and for
eighty-two saloon licenses at $85 each.
$5330. These two lots of licenses mad.'
a total of $8590 collected. On February
1 McGeoghegan reported that he had
only collected $32S0 on these two classes
of licenses. Here a deficit of $3310 was
found. The rest of the money taken- Is
from other municipal licenses. We find
the handwritings of three different per
sons on his books since January 1- Wil
liam Taaffe. a relative, arid a man
named Bailey has been in the office
with him. There are no deputies al
lowed the City Treasurer and whatever
work they did McGeoghegan had to pay
for out of his own pocket.
"Since January 31 McGeoghegan has
not kept his books posted. On January
1 everything was straight In his office,
that is, his accounts and cash balanced,
and if anything had been crooked it
would have been necessary, to bring in
some cash to cover It. What is per
plexing In the case is that all this
money should be taken in two weeks.
We can learn nothing around town
where he has spent money so freely aa
to get away with .this amount."

TIENTSIN, March 9. â The Japanese forces have advanced from the
Yalu River. They have captured Fungwangcheng and have driven out the
Russians In the vicinity to Fenshuling, the eastern pass, and are In force
seventy miles to the east of -Newchwang. The Russians are strongly in
trenched at Liaoyang- and Haichen, /where a battle is imminent. Some
small engagements have been fought, the Russians falling back with loss.
All of the women and children are leaving Newchwang.
The Japanese are using the same tactics' and' are advancing on the
same route as was employed during their war with China.
YINKOW, March 9.â It is reported that the Japanese have repulsed
the '"Russians at Fungwangcheng. __
Four 4-lnch siege guns were brought by rail to Newchwang to-day and
placed, in the fort at the river mouth. Two. heavy guns are at the Rus

LONDON, March 10.â A dispatch to the Times from Weihaiwel, dated
March 9, says: "It is reported on good authority that a collision between
Japanese and Russian troops, has occurred near Haiju, Korea, fifty-four
miles northwest of Chemulpo, which resulted in the defeat of the Rus
sians." ; . . . ...Â¦â¢ ,
WASHINGTON, March 9.â Reports have reached. Commander Sawyer
of the United States steamship Helena at Ylnkow that the Japanese and
Russians fought at Fungwangcheng, which is forty-five miles northwest of
Antuhg. Commander Sawyer, In a cablegram to the Navy Department,
supplements this news with the statement that Japanese troops have been
landed at Tashan, which is supposed to mean Takushan, a fairly good port,
about forty miles from the mouth of thfl Yalu.
No. details have been received here about any of these engagements
or movements of troops. The Japanese, legation is unadvised of the latest
development of the situation. ..". ,
Fungwangchehg is, however, less .than. 100 mile's from the Port Ar
thur branch of the Russian railway, and the fact .that the Japanese are
thus far. advanced across the. Yalu River leads many persons here to be
lieve that the Japanese '; endeavor is to flank the Russian force, which Is pre
sumably concentrated toward . Port Arthur.
Â¦ A fairly- good' road runs from Fungw-angcheng' to" Haichen./on the rail
road. If the Japanese were successful at Fungwangcheng they possess a
great advantage iii the control of this road. It is assumed -that the Jap
anese force at Fungwangcheng; must have landed at the mouth of the
Yaiu.and west of this, inasmuch as. the Japanese force already In Northern
Korea is reported not. to have pressed the; Russians back farther than the
country north of Plngyang. â¢ â¢ BHfiSBSSKS!

Word of the predicament of Johnson
and McKay was sent to Nevills, and
he sent two guards, armed with re
peating shotguns, to protect the men.
McKay and Johnson were escorted to
the mine and are there yet. The mine
ts gruarded night and day by Nevills 1
men, who are heavily armed.
The strikers then returned to town,
went to the home of Charles Johnson,
an employe in the Rawhide mine, and
threatened to kill him if he did not
pet out of town. He was struck in
th*> face and knocked down, but he
managed to escape and find shelter in
the home of a Jamestown storekeeper.
The strikers, it is said, next attacked
Arthur McKay, who was walkingr along
the street and who was suspected of
being in Nevills' employ. They de
manded to know his business in James
town, and told him that if they were
cure he intended to go to work at the
Rawhide mine they would ride him out
of town on a rail. He finally escaped
and was given protection by the same
man who had taken Johnson into his
home.
STOCKTON, March 9.â The striking
miners at Jamestown attacked Captain
Nevills. the owner of the Rawhide and
App mines, and a party of strike break

tpite the injunction from the Federal
court served on them last week, and
that they have so frightened the cor

that the latter are afraid to send .vut
any news of the strikers' doings.
Captain Nevills, accompanied by As
tjsuint Superintendent Burk of the
Rawhide mine; James Hammond,
George Westenhamer and about twen
ty non-union men who were going to
work in the Rawhide mine, arrived on
the train Sunday and were met at the
depot by about 200 strikers. The mob,
it is said, attacked Nevills and struck
him with some missile before his six
guards, armed with repeating shotguns,
could surround him and drive back his
assailants. During the melee one of
the strikers was struck on the head
with the barrel of a revolver and was
seriously injured.
Nevills, Hammond, Burk and 'West

sisted in holding the strikers at bay
while the non-union men got into wag

fpecial Dispatch to The Call
This question was dropped and Gor
man criticized the growth of army ap
propriations within the past few years.
A joint resolution of the House was
passed authorizing the Secretary of the
Interior to use $5000 of the amount
appropriated to . place allottees of
Creek and Cherokee lands In unre
stricted possession of such lands.
The Philippine shipping bill was
taken up and Culberson and Patterson
opposed it.
Patterson's substitute of a tonnage
tax bill in the interest of American
vessels was voted down and the bill
was amended at Lodge's instance so
as to provide for the continuation in
operation of the navigation laws in re
gard to vessels arriving in the Philip
pines from the United SU.tes. The bill
was then passed.
The conference report on the legis
lative, executive* and judicial appro
priation bill- was agreed to and the bill
Bacon a!ao contended that no au
thority, short of Congress with pro
priety could assign a site in the na
tional capital for statues.
Lodge called attention to the fact
that the ground on which the statue
to Frederick the Great was to be
erected was p. military reservation.
Bacon replied that Congress had
especial control of all public grounds
in the District of Columbia.. ..,, - .^.
"What I protest against," he satdi*
"is the idea of making this country
the' dumping ground for statues of
man who, while heroes in their own
country, stand for ideals totally differ
ent from our own." ;Vl. i.
He said he would be glad if tho Em
peror would send the statue of another
German. Â¦ â¢
Stewart said that Frederick's char
acter had been "grossly misrepre
sented. He was a most remarkable
man," the Senator went on, "and mil
lions of people in this country revere
his memory almost as much as we
revere the memory of our own Wash
ington. It would be ungracious not to
accept the statue; we should not raise
any delicate points about his political
beliefs."
IMPORTANT BILLS PASSED.
"These qualities," continued Bacon,
"give Frederick his rank in history,
but it is inconsistent with the traditiona
and hopes of the people of 'the United
States that there should be erected
here a monument to the memory Â¦ of
the man who perhaps. to a greater ex
tent than any other man of modern
times was a type of absolutism."
BACOX EXTEKS PROTEST.
Bacon added some observations rela
tive to -the acceptance of the statue,
prefacing^his statement with the ex
planation that he meant no' affront In
what. he- might, say either, to the.Presi
dent or the : Emperor of the German
people. He would be pleased to see
statues of many Germans erected in
the capital of the United States, men
distinguished In science or the arts,
such as Goethe or Wagner, for in
stance. "But," he went on, "I do not
believe that the erection of a statue
of Frederick the Great in this city is
in accord with the wishes of the peo
ple o! "the United States." He was
sure, at any rate, that many felt that
way r and he was one of them. He said
there is no single thing connected with
the history of Frederick that would
make him an ideal for the people of
the United States except his courage
and devotion to his people, which all
must admire.
WASHINGTON,- March :9.-^During

protested against the acceptance of the
statue "of 'Frederick the Great of Ger

The news w&3 a severe shock to the
Baroness. - Her first decision was to
leave on the evening train for the Pa
cific Coast,' but she has been ill for sev
eral days, an'd at the urgent wish of
her family probably will not attempt
the trip. Miss Ivy Langham, whose en

Faramond. naval attache of the French
embassy, has Just been announced, is
spending the winter here with her sis

his post here, and has asked Arthur
Langham to come to Washington to
consult about arrangements for the
funeral.

That meeting was held last evening
st Senator Bard's committee-room and
the .movement toward harmony was
brought to- a sudden halt. Senator Per
kins said he had given his consent to
the proposition made by Senator Bard
under a misapprehension; he said there
was no occasion at this time for en
tcriry? into -my sach iron-clad compact,
as there were no nominations to- be
made... and in any event he would wish
to reserve .three or four offices. He
eaid he could not see his way clear to
resigning: the i>atronage at San Fran
cisco to Representatives scattered all
over the State. He* knew the condi
tions, and the men better than any
other man In the delegation, he. said,
and therefore felt that he fhould re
serve the ripht to nominate the candi
dates for office stationed there. As a
result <if this stand the negotiations
of which so much was expected came
to nothing.
WASHINGTON. March 9.â A few

upon the getting together of the Cali

distribution of Federal patronage. Aa
a result of the conference of the Hous â¢
delegation Congressman Metcalf said in
effect that the reservation made in be

should be urged that, was objectionable
to a member of the' House. He sug
gested that a meeting should be held
at which the matter could be discussed.

for several minutes, j Grosvenor" [of

said that this was a pretty good sped r

Moon of Tennessee insisted,.- that
there should be en investigation cov
ering the Postoffice â¢ Department; and
everybody connected with it, adding.;
"and whoever is guilty, whether ; in.
this House or in the department,
should be exposed." - . i
W. W. Kitchen of North Carolina
charged Bristow^ with having de
liberately suppressed 'important; and
material, facts, "facts," he said,,pound
ing his desk, "which could not be over
looked and which were suppressed,- hy
my Judgment, for the purpose of giving
a false impression to the country and

ous nor honest, but for partisan pur

"It cannot be said with absolute
assurance or accuracy," he continued,
"that there was in no instance any'
violation of any law whatever by any
number of Congress in making any
recommendation, either for increase of
clerk hire allowance or increase of rent
of postoffice buildings." r '..'.; V ''." Â¦",-
Overstreot moved that debate con-,
tinue until 4 o'clock to-morrow, which
was agreed to unanimously, Â¦'y.j
Overstreet took the floor and said
that whatever may be the truth of the
allegations in the several indictments
against postal officials the mere fact
that the various recommendations of
Representatives in Congress passed
through the hands of men whose con
duct has been severely criticized and
whose liberties have been threatened
imputes neither censurable conduct nor
improper acts on their part.
Replj'ing, Hepburn said:
"There is no member of this House
who desires to screen anybody in this
matter." ;v W-' ' ,
This remark elicited loud applause
from both sides of the House and in
the galleries, which by this time had
filled up to the limit.
MEMBERS GllOW WRATH V. .
Hepburn of Iowa said that any in
vestigation of the ' Postpffice Depart
ment would not" elicit" any facts not
brought out by the committee's re
port'. .
"I say an investigation would elicit
further facts, and that the facts have
been suppressed," retorted William Al
den Smith, amid loud applause from
the floor and the galleries.
As to the Hay resolution Williams
said it- did not touch the question,
adding "somebody at the postoflice has.
spmeh'dw 'Incluued in the report the
name of man after man in the House
of Representatives and Senate guilty of
no apparent wrong, guilty of no viola
tion of law. guilty of no moral obloquy,

. . "What was the motive of it? Wasn't
-it to give the Congr^ss'jiotice" that the
department held something over Con

department alone?" he inquired, his
-words foelne drowned by applause from
both side's/
'Â¦ "Are you going to meet it?" he de
manded. ' ; .
General Bristow.
Williams, the Democratic leader,
urged a complete investigation of thÂ«
whole Postoffice Department and re
ceived the hearty applause of both sides
of the House and the galleries. It soon
was found that the three hours which
had been allotted to the subject would
not be nearly enough to meet the per
sonal explanations which members were
demanding the right to .make,, and a
motion to extend the debate, until 4
o'clock to-morrow was carried.
When the House met the invocation
was delivered by -Rev. J. J. Dolliver,
father of Senator Dolliver. Immedi
ately thereafter W. Bourke Cockran,
who was elected to succeed Mayor M-c^
Clellan from the Twelfth District of
New York, was sworn In.
Overstreet of. Indiana, chairman . of
the Committee on Postoffices and Post
roads, was recognized. He had, he
said, consulted with members on both
sides of the House who desired more
time than three hours, to discuss the
Hay resolution bearing on the Bristow
charge in connection with postal af-_
fairs. He therefore suggested a post
ponement of the consideration of the
resolution until next Monday. x . .
He was applauded at this remark and
continuing said: . . â¢
"I want to go to the very bottom.
We have. shown our willingness."
DEMANDS INVESTIGATION.
Williams' said he" wanted the corrup
tion in the : Postoffice Department in
vestigated, "not by the friends of the
men who have been guilty of the cor
ruption," but by the House of Represen
tatives. ; *w:** :
WASHINGTON, March 9.â That an
investigation of the Postoffice Depart
ment by the House of Representatives
will result from the publication' of the
report-naming- members of Congress m
that connection was indicated by every
expression possible short of a yote In
that body to-day. With a whirlwind of
protest the report was taken up by in
dignant members, their personal con
nection ""with it explained and epithets
hurled at Fourth Assistant Postmaster
The naval appropriation billy was
eent to conference, the Speaker ap
pointing Messrs. Foss, Dayton and
Meyer conferees on the _part - of the
House and at 5 o'clock the House ad-
Journed. . â¢â ; :^M
Thompson of Alabama, also named
in the report, characterized the re
port as infamous and having for Its
object the intimidation of members in
order to keep them from insisting on
their rights.
Robinson of Arkansas demanded an
investigation of the entire Postoffice
Department, "it having to
being unable to conduct its affairs with
a fair degree of seeming propriety."
Cooper of Wisconsin interrupted
Robinson and said' he had been in
formed by an old member of the House
that.General Bristow, "trembling from
illness," told that member, that he
(Bristow) had never seen the report as
it was now printed. "Therefore," said
Cooper, "I think -the abuse of him
ought to stop."
Butler of Pennsylvania, another ac
cused member, said he never before
understood the duties of Representa
tives, but he' now conceived them to
be of "singular and conspicuous inac
tivity." "' He differed, he said, from
General Bristow, and he would defy
any one to close the doors of the de
partment to him. Whoever had as-,
sailed him, he said, was a coward.
Hill Of Connecticut, likewisenie.ntjon
ed 4 in tile Bristow report, 'denieS that he
ha"d done anything improper. He had,
he said, submitted certain questions
to General Bristow, answers to which
had been refused. "I . am going to
vote for a resolution" to investigate
myself and to Investigate the Fourth
Assistant Postmaster General," he said
amid. a round of applause. Holding
up a. copy of the report Hill vehement
ly declared "thut document is the pro
duction of a li:ir and a scoundrel."
BID DEFIANCE TO BRISTOW.
5 Then, showing the effects of his in
dignation, Grosvenor pounded his desk
again and said: .. ...:.....
"I condemn. the man that sent that
into this House. Can any self-respect
ing Congressman ever enter the office
of the man . who will produce- such a
document as that?" , ; , . . Â¦ \ t
This report, . he. â¢ added., would rj be
printed abroad and .It would be said
that In the American Congress there
were 191 rascals. If th^Postofflce De
partment had some official whose judg
ment was so dwarfed by the c-pinion of
a Congressman the officials had better
be turned out, he declared!'- The Bris
tow report, he said in conclusion, was
conceived in sin and born in Iniquity,
and had traveled its course" until it
had struck the public of the -^United
States as a great attack on a body of
men "as free from wrongdoing, corrup
tion, crime and irregularity as an equal
number of men on the face of the
earth."
-Lilley of Connecticut, who was
charged in the report with being a
technical violator of the' law in leas
ing a building at Winsted, Conn., to
the Government for po-stoffice purposes,
explained that within twenty-four
hours after his' attention had been
called to the statute in question he
had made personal application at the
Postoffice Department to have the lease
canceled. First . Assistant Postmaster
General Wynne 'had asked him to de
lay the matter that he might take it
up with the law department. He had
been informed by a written opinion
from the department two days later
that his election to Congress did not
invalidate the lease in any way.
"I ' will resign my seat to-morrow,"
he said, pounding his desk, "if there
is anything irregular and' improper in
what I did." . '"Â¦'Â¦.:'" "'* 'V.
bristow' isi> scored: Â¦
rage and a violation of every principle
of justice."
Prolonged applause followed this
statement. He wanted to ,. know- i. by :
what right the Bristow â¢ report had
been published before the 'action
of any tribunal had 'established -the
truth of it. In order to show what he
termed \'the infinite rascality" of the
Bristow report, -\ Grosvenor explained
the cases in which his name was men
tioned. Â¦Â¦Â«.-â¢Â¦

Auditor with a small shortage in hin
accounts.
McGeoghegan is one of the most pop
ular young men In the city. He Is the
son of John T. McGeoghegan. cashier
of the Commercial and Savings Bank,
arid a rjephey of B. D. Murphy. He is
about 30 years old. McGeoghegan was
a member of the Eighth California
Regiment during the Spanish-Ameri
can War. On coming Â¦ from the . army
he. was appointed City Treasurer by
llayor Martin to succeed the late J.
N. Ewing, who died,in office. He wa3
elected four* years ago with a very
large majority and two years ago was
the only, one upon . the Martin admin
istration ticket to be elected. .
There is an effort being made by
McGeoghegan"s friends to make up
the* shortage, but as the amount is
large, they, may not be ablg to do so.
The surety company, it is believed, if
the shortage is covered, will not prose

Piano Player Killed by a Train.
REDDING, March 9. â Investigation
developed that the mangled remains
found this morning on the railroad
near Lahioine.were those of S. Plun

aged 32 years. Plunkett spent Tues
day at Lamoine and caught the mid
night passenger train, expecting to

posed he fell from the brakebeam.
,questions in regard to the revelations
received by Smith and Van Cott, but
the defense objected to the character
of the inquiry. He proceeded to dis
cuss the point at some length, when
Senator Hoar interrupted, saying he
"would object to arguments by the at
torneys calculated to overthrow the
rules established by the Senate years
ago in' the matter of conducting in
vestigations." v
Senator Dubois explained that he
â¢was not a lawyer and It was. his pur
pose to ask questions which * a layman
would be -likely to understand, and- he
Smith took the book and read a
verse which declared that when the
Lord wanted his seed propagated he
would command it. This, the wit
ness declared, justifies polygamy when
a person is commanded, by the Lord
to enter that state. He said the com
mand came to individuals as revela
tions from" the Lord.
Senator Dubois asked a number of
Reading from the book, which is
called the Mormon Bible, Chairman
Burrows called attention to trie words
of God reference to David and Sol
omon and hla displeasure because of
the fact that he kept more than one
wife and many concubines. The? chair
man asked if that did not prohibit
polygamy and, if that did not prohbit
when was the law of the Lord changed
in order to permit the practice.
. Two more verses were read and
these provoked like requests until the
chairman objected.
JUSTIFIES POLYGAMY.
Chairman Burrows asked the wit
ness to Identify the Book of Mormon,
and then, turning to the revelation of
the prophet, Joseph Smith, he asked
specifically in regard to the manner it
was revealed and was informed that
it was revealed to him by God. J
Chairman Burrows asked if polyg
amy was taught In that book and
Smith answered that It was emphat
ically forbidden.
"Is this sealing for eternity ever
performed for living persons?"
"I believe I have heard of one or
two such cases," said the witness.
"Are any polygamists ever sealed
for eternity?"
"No. sir."
SEALING FOR ETERNITY.
Chairman Burrows insisted upon
to the marriage ceremony performed
in the church. He spoke of the mar
riages for time, the marriages for time
and eternity and the marriages for
eternity only, and asked if the latter
is riot called "sealing."
. "They are all called sealing," was
the response.
Chairman Burrows inisted upon
knowing from the witness whether he
would have investigated such charges
against any of the apostles, and the
witness answered again, "It is not my
business to do it."
you do not take steps to have corrected
what you term false charges?"
"It is not my business to do so," the
witness replied with emphasis.
"The question is, do youT' r said Chair
man Burrows.
Smith then explained that it is the
-duty of the bishops' courts to pass upon
the morals of those who live in their
wards or districts.
"Does that include officials of the
church?" was asked.
"It includes all members."
When asked if the rule applies to
officials who are above the bishops
in authority, Smith said it did not. .

The seventh day of the hearings was
opened by Attorney Tayler for the proÂ»
ecution recalling President Joseph F.
Smith of the Mormon church to the
stand. Smith was questioned as to an
interview he gave In 1902, giving statis
tics in regard to the church and the
number of polygamists In Utah. Smith
had said the entire interview consists!
of statistics and that In that statement
he had said nothing for the purpose of
supporting the candidacy of Reed
Smoot for the Senatorshlp. On hearing
the interview read Smith admitted that
he had been quoted correctly in regard
to Smoot and urged his election.
Smith said he was acquainted with
Benjamin Cluff Jr., president of the
beard of faculty of the Brlgham
Young Academy, and that he is re
puted to be a polygamist. He also was
asked about Abraham Cannon and if
the general charge had, not been that
he took a plural wife, Lillian Hamlin,
since the manifesto of 1890.
Smith said that had been a news
paper charge and he had paid no at
tention to it,
"The officers of the Mormon church
are sensitive in regard to the charge
that plural marriages have been per
formed since 1890, are they not?" Tay
ler asked. . Â¦
Smith said he thought they were very
sensitive on the subject.
He was asked then whether he had
taken steps to run down the stories
that the laws had been violated by
officers of the church. "He answered
that the publfc charge did not concern
him, and that if he took time to an
swer all the charges made against him
self and other officials of the church
he would have no time to do other
work. : ; '-Â¦Â¦:Â¦. '
Loren Harmer, formerly a bishop of
the Mormon church, to-day gave the
first testimony in favor of the defence
that has been offered thus far in the
eight days of the hearings.^ He said
he was convicted of the crime of adul
tery and that he believed Smoot was
responsible for his arrest. The charge
against Harmer was unlawful cohab
itation with a woman who was not his
wife and not a prosecution on .account
of cohabitation with his plural wives.
President Smith and a number of the
officials of the church who have been
Â¦witnesses in the case to-day were ex
cused from further attendance and they
will return to Utah.
DOES NOT HEED CHARGES.
WASHINGTON, March 9.â Several
I officials of the Mormon church to-day
S testified in the Senator Smoot case be
' fore the Senate Committee on Priv
| ileges and Elections that they had
piural wives and had continued to prac
tice, polygamous cohabitation since the
Â¦ manifesto of 1S?O. Just before adjourn
! mtnt for the day the committee held
an executive session for the purpose of
having read the unprintable testimony
j in the Teasdale divorce case. The pro"
j ecution stated that it had no more wit
nesses ready to put on the stand on
account of the failure of several sum
moned officials of the Mormon church
to appear. President Joseph F. Smith
v.as asked to use his influence with the
i witnesses and promised to get into com
munication with them if it was pos
sible to do so.-

provision for extradition should be
made and tariff duties should be im
pos*d on goods coming from the canal

the power to fix the rates of duty on '

Andrew Jensen, assistant historian
of the church, at the afternoon ses
sion said he had two wives who were
sisters and .they both lived in the same
house, though he lived with the first.
Jensen said he was not sealed in eter
nity to the mother of the two wives.
Loren Harmer testified that he wai
a Bishop for five or six years, but had
been sent to. the penitentiary in 1899
upon conviction of unchastity and lost
his good standing. He said he had
two wives, Ella and Ida, and had lived
also with Ellen Anderson, but never, as
her husband. He said she had two
children by him, one since he had re
turned from , the penitentiary. He
now lives in Springville.'He said Ellen
Anderson supports herself and that he
had nothing for herself or'
her "children. He said she had prop
erty of her own. - â¢
Harmer was asked if Senator Smoot
had anything to do with his arrest.
"I think he caused it," he said. "He
was councilor at that time to the
president of the stake, who was then
away. He: called me, to Provo and
told me the church proposed to take
away my bishopric and other offices.
"Why was he going' to take away
your offices?" . â¢
" "Because I had committed a crime."
Â¦~"-;"What crime?"
"Adultery, to be frank."
"Why do you think Smoot caused
your arrest?''
"Because before I * reached ' home
the Sheriff overtook and put me un
der arrest. I blamed * Smoot for
sending the Sheriff 'after; mei >I
thought he might have given me more
time, although' the crime was a bad
one.: I do not know that Smoot was
responsible for my arrest, but :' it
looked much like it."

Senator Hoar asked some questions,

"The' children of plural wives get
only what t is willed to them or to their

The witness answered that he had re
ceived no revelation sustained i.i that
manner and explained again that
individuals^ by living a moral life in
the sight of the Lord, could receive'
revelations if they were prayerful. He
said the Lord would manifest his will

"Have you received any individual

about two years, but had not followed

times he went down to recover lost
anchors and was endeavoring to pick
up an anchor lost from the bar dredger

first descent was made shortly after
the dinner hour from the tug Mendell

aboard. When the metal hood was re
moved from his head it was found
Norton's air supply had failed. The
man was still allve< but died after
gasping a moment for breath. The in

that he was a brother-in-law of Cap

employed him.
' ASTORIA; March 9.â Arthur Norton,

In San Francisco, met a tragic death
here this afternoon while engaged in
marine diving. In some manner as yet
unexplained the air pumping apparatus
failed to work properly, with the result
that the man was suffocated below the
surface of the water. His sufferings
must have been frightful, as the head
was swollen tp twice its normal size
and the blood vessels had burst. The
swelling was so great as to render tht

PARIS, March 9.â The case of Colom
bia against the Panama Canal Com
pany came up to-day before the First
Chamber of the Tribunal of the Seine,
M. Dltte presiding. There axe two
case* before the court, the first seek
ing to prevent the transfer of the canal
concession to the United States and
the other relative to the right of Co
lombia to hold shares in the company.
The arrurneata to-day were upon the
first c&ae. Both elfies were represented
by a strong 1 array of counsel. The
opening argument en behalf of. Co
lombia -was made by Maitre Brunei.
He cited the original concessions re-
Quiring the express authorization of
Colombia before any transfer could be
made valid, and asserted that Panama
did not now exist as a free and inde
pendent state, but was simply a revo
lutionary organization. Moreover, the
rights Trhicb Colombia acquired under
the terms of the original concession
v ere Inalienable and could not be taken
up by Panama, even If a regular gov
ernment existed. Maitre Du Bult, one
of the foremost advocate* In the Hum
bert proceedings, argued Tor the com
pany. He Insisted on the regularity
of the organization of the Government
of Panama, declared all the rights of
Cclembla had been extinguished and
cald the company was bound to recog
nize thÂ« condition of superior force
which transferred the sovereignty dyer

BERLIN, March 9.â Die Flotte (The
Fleet), the official publication of the
German Naval League, in a two-page
leader entitled "What Do We Learn
From the' Russo-Japanese War?" says
that the occurrences in the Far East
point with flaming fingers to the urgent
necessity" for hastening the 'building of
the German fleet programme. The two
principles deduclble from the conflict,
the paper affirms, are that Russia
agaihst her will . became entangled in
war, a misfortune that might occur to
Germany, and. that 'battleships decide
sea fights, while torpedo-lJoats achieve
results only under especially favorable
circumstances. The German duty, be
fore it is too late, is to have 'practically
the construction already authorized and
to add to the scheme, for naval defense
adopted in 1900. â.-,"/â¢- ;â¢'
On this point both the London and
the Paris Cabinets are in accord. Their
action is only, a question -of time, but
thS opportunity is not considered to
have yet presented itself.
Signs are not wanting that the Ger
mans are not at all unanimous In sup
port of Russia. Thus the Cologne Volks
Zeitung in an article on Germany's re
lations, with Russia says: *
"It would be of great moral import
ance as the result of the present war if
the Immense' respect felt fgr Russia
should disappear â a respect which lias
been the cause of ny>re success for Rus
sian policy than anything that she h"as
really done. It is not in the interests of
Far Eastern people, and less in the
interest of Germany, that Russia
should assume a preponderant position
and appear as an arbiter of the des
tiny of the world, before whom all must
bow. .A Russian victory would not only
cause her to become the third power in
the Far East, but would call for the full,
pressure, of the Franco-Russian alli
ance in Europe â pressure which would
outdo all which we have yet expe
rienced." ,
The Post states, however, that .France
and England are only waiting for a fa
vorable moment to ' tender their good
offices. â¢ .

letter no appeal whatever is made for
mediation by neutral powers, nor is
there any reference to a possible appeal

George Kennan, traveler, writer ar.d
lecturer, arrived here last evening from
Washington with his wife and will de
part for Japan to-day on the trans
port Buford. He is going to the Orient
in th* interests of Outlook, not par
ticularly as a war correspondent, but
to study the problems out of which the
Japanese-Russian war arose and th-<se
that may develop during the progress
of the hostilities. Kennan has visited
Russia twice and is well acquainted
with the political and social conditions
of the empire, a fact which he has
demonstrated in the books He has
written and in his lectures, which re
sulted in his being escorted out of
Russia on the occasion of his last tt!p
to that country. During an Intervltw
last evening Kennan said:
"Although I have been sincere In my
descriptions of the conditions existing
in that country. I cherish no ill feeling
against tha Russians for their con
duct toward me. nor has their treat
ment biased me in my opinion of the
nation and its ruler in the matter of
warfare. I regard the Czar as a good
man. who, unfortunately, has been be
trayed by the war party. I also have
a great respect for the Russian sol
dier, but undoubtedly the military or
ganization of the empire is inferior to
that of Japan. Prominent Russian of
ficials have admitted this much to me.
"Russia has long been eager to dom
inate over China, a fact which the
great nations know, and should her
ambition be realized It would seriously
menace the future of India. With
Japan, which has given assurance to
Peking that the Mikado will maintain
China's integrity, it is the aim to se
cure control over Korea and drive
Russia out of Manchuria, which is
Japan's only hope of maintaining Â»n r
Â«wn national intr grity. I Delicti* that
the war will develep many interesting
problems anÂ«l 10 these I hope to give
as much of ray attention os possible."

ST. PETERSBURG, March 9.âCare
ful Inquiry concerning the outlook in
the Balkans develops that the prevail
ing opinion in ' Government as well as
in diplomatic circles is against an out
break of war In the spring, although
the danger Is not considered passed.
A perfect understanding exists between
Russia and Austria, and, besides, the
Russian authorities appear to be com
pletely satisfied regarding the attitude
of Bulgaria. What assurances the au
thorities have concerning Bulgaria are
not known, but they do not tally with
direct information from other source?,
representing Bulgaria as having her
army under mobilization, with having
her plans perfected for an Invasion of
Turkey and as being confident that she
can defeat the Turks single-handed.
Evidently the Porte also is alarmed at
the outlook, as an American (the rep
resentative of an ordnance firm, who
came here to act as a broker in the sale
of South American warships to Russia)
has been requested to go to Constan
tinople immediately, the Sultan desiring
to purchase a large supply of guns.
It is a mistake to imagine that Rus
sia Is so engrossed with affairs in the
Far East as to b% unable to give atten
tion to the Balkans. She has carefully
refrained from removing troops from
the vicinity of the Roumanian frontier
and will be prepared, if necessary,' to
assume her share in the event of war.
KIEPF, Russia, March 9.â The papers
here make a feature of an interview
with a Japanese correspondent of the
Nichi Niche, who is now visiting the
Balkans. He is quoted as saying the
Japanese fully recognize that they have
no hope of defeating Russia unless her
attention is diverted by possible com
plications in the Balkans. The object
of his visit, is to ascertain the chancea
of such trouble breaking out.
In a bank, subject to our orders as
soon as we present the papers showing
that the cruiser has. been turned over
to the Turkish Government. This cere
mony will probably occur on Thurs
day."
Japan Hopes a War in the Near East
Will Divert the Attention of
Her Enemy.
In a remarkable statement given to the press a high official in the St. Petersburg For
eign Office asserts that the attitude of the American Secretary of State alone stands in the way
of an accord of the powers that would prevent any other nation than the present belligerents
being drawn into the war. It is declared that Secretary Hay's diplomacy is a "nightmare" to
the governments of Europe, which are unable (o fathom the aims or intentions of the United
States.
News of a series of land engagements comes from various Far Eastern sources. It is
said the Russians were defeated near Haiju, northwest of Chemulpo; but as the Japanese have
advanced in force far beyond that point it is,probable that if any engagement occurred it was
with Russian scouts. British and American Consuls/have advised the women and children to
leave Newchwang, against which town a Japanese force is moving. It is believed the Russians
will abandon Newchwang to the enemy. â¢>
A London journal prints a unique story illustrative of the confidence of the Japanese in
their ability to defeat the Russians. It say^ Japan is placing contracts for coal, to be shipped di
rect to Port Arthur and Vladivostok, although these . are at the present time Russia's most
heavily fortified strongholds in the Far East.
The TokioMispatch. announcing that the Russiansat Port Arthur had succeeded in float
in? all of the warships damagedin Admiral Togo's first attack with torpedoes is confirmed in
a dispatch direct from Port Arthur. . â¢ : ; >*
The most sensation/^ feature of yesterday's war reports was. the announcement that
Tapanese troops had appeared in Manchuria, to the rear of the Russian position on the.. Ya1u
River, wherethey had routed a Muscovite force. Whence these troops came is not' stated, and
the assertion appears almost incredible. No movement of Japanese troops in sufficient force
to have already invaded this region, which is held by the main Russian army, has been report
ed. Should. the claim of a Japanese victory prove true, the brown men would appear to/4iave
broken the backbone of Russian resistance in Southern Manchuria and to.be able to â¢ seize tHe
Manchurian Railroad at will. It is to be noted in this connection that advices have been receiv
ed in Washington that Japanese troops had appeared in the vicinity of Antung, this indicat
ing that the Japanese were 'landing an army on the Manchurian side' of the Yalu and in the
rear of the Russian defenses. *
A DMIRAL TOGO'S fleet bombarded the forts at Dalny and then attacked Port Arthur
/Â¦% on Monday, according to a dispatch from Tokio. No details' are given. Washington ex
perts believe these bombardments were for the purpose of keeping the Russians-occu
pied while Japanese troops were being landed on Liaotung Peninsula.
No authentic news concerning the fate of the Russian Vladivostok squadron has been
received. Tokio is hourly awaiting details of the naval engagement believed to have been fought
in the Sea of Japan.

VON WALDERSEE'S
DREAM OF EMPIRE
IN THE FAR EAST
PARIS, March 9.â Colonel Marchand,
the hero of Fashoda^ in the course of
an interview published in the Matin
to-day, is' quoted as having said that
the late Field Marshal von Waldersee,
while in command of the allied forces
at Peking, had the purpose of making
the province of Chill part of the hinter-,
land of the German possessions In
Shantung, and was prevented only
through repeated Russian representa
tions to Germany. *
The colonel, who accompanied the
French forces to Peking, describes his
intimate personal relations with the
field marshal during the operations of
the allies and adds that Von Walder
see complimented Marchand on the lat
ter's African achievements and v in
vited him frequently to be a guest at
his private table. They discussed the
organization and merits of French
troops. Concerning the present war.
Colonel Marchand remarks:
"Field Marshal von Waldersee was
too diplomatic to express an opinion
upon the general question which al
ready was seen to be presented and
which is now being solved by recourse
to arms. He strictly carried out this
rule of advancing German interests:
He desired particularly that Chili
should become in some way la hinter
land of German Shantung and repeated
obse/vation'3 by Russia to the chan
cellory in Berlin alone prevented his
carrying out his project.".
ST. PETERSBURG, March 9.â The
Emperor received this afternoon repre
sentatives of the Russian press, headed
by M. Souvorin. proprietor of the Novoe
Vremya, who came to present to his
-.Majesty an address concerning the
var. The sovereign was particularly
gracious and shook hands with every
one. He said he recognized the. great
importance of the press, which had well
represented public sentiment, for which
he was grateful.
"I beg you in the future to write the
truth, and nothing but the truth." he
paid, addressing Souvorin. "I am grate
ful to you for having started a patriotic
fund for warships. It is an excellent
idea."
It may be mentioned that the fund
now reaches $15,000,000.
A telegram was received to-day from
Viceroy Alexieff which caused conster
nation to military attaches and war
correspondents. It was to the effect
that he did not- propose allowing one
or the other to come irtto Manchuria
until the disposition of the troops was
fully made. That is to say, early in
April, according to our calendar.
Contrary to the report of a shortage
of coal. Vladivostok has 12.000,000 poods
on hand. A pood is thirty-six pounds
avoirdupois. I have excellent authority
for saying that Port Arthur also has
ample supplies of coal and provisions.
Captain Rudineff, commander of the
sunken Variag. in reward for his cour
age has been appointed an aid-de-camp
to the Emperor. All of the officers and
men will receive the cross of St. George.
General Kuropatkin will take the S
o'clock train- on Saturday night instead
of the later express, wishing to gain
time to Mofcow, which city will give
him a grand ovation.
The Xovoe Vremya has a leader to
day on coal as contraband. It argues
that it has been srÂ» considered since the
American Civil War, hut now that
England has coal to sell to Japan she
objects. .
Following is the text of the Emperor's
telegram to Viceroy Alexieff:
"ST. PETERSBURG, February 11.â
Mobilization is proclaimed in the Sibe
rian provinces. You are empowered to
act as commander in chief. I -am with
you heart and soul and with our brave

leave as soon as possible and will be
replaced. The famiiy of United States
Consul Miller will leave \to-morro'w.
It is understood that the neutral pow
ers will not embarrass- Japan by the
presence of warships in the river here,
and therefore neutral interests at New
chwang will be officially abandoned.
The tension among the Russians con
tinues. There are circumstantial native
reports of fighting east of the railroad,
and there is some evidence of a Japa
nese advance. It is Reported that the
action of the Russians in ordering
Xewchwang to be fortified was due to
the withdrawal of the foreign warships,
thus removing the last possibility of
the neutralization of this port. The
Russians received by train to-day two
five-inch guns and two six-pounder
howitzers. They were unloaded at the
Newchwang railroad station.
COAST DEFENSES
IN READINESS
TOKIO. Tuesday. March S. (De
lnyed in transmission.) â It is believed
here that there has already been a
decisive naval engagement in the vi
cinity of Vladivostok and tidings of it
are anxiously awaited. The Japan
ese fleet did not, it is said, go to Vlad
ivostok for the rturpose of bombard
ing the town, but to locate and at
tack the armored cruisers Gromoboi.
Hossiay and Rurik and the cruiser
Bogatyr. forming the Russian squad
ron Ftationed there. It is understood
here that when the Japanese fleet ar
rived there on Sunday last it found
the Rus?ian~squjidron absent If this
is true, it gave the Japanese squadron
advantages in the way of avoiding a
battle close to the inshore batteries,
at the same t!me putting it in a posi
tion to prevent the Russian ships re
entering the harbor. It is doubted
that the Japanese withdrew their en
tire, fleet, unless the location of the
enemy had been discovered, as it
meant surrendering the advantage of
being in a position between the ene
my and the enemy's base. There is a
Ftrong possibility that the Japanese
found the Russian ships in the vicin
ity of Possiet Bay and gave them bat
tle there. Â«
The names and number of ships in
rhe Japanese fleet have been kept se
cret, but it was probably sufficiently
strong to divide into two divisions, the
one to guard Vladivostok and the
other to cruise in search of the Rus
f ian ships. < It is said that the new-re
purchased cruisers. Nisshln and Ka-

The United States Circuit Court of
Appeals yesterday handed down a de

the judement of deportation was en

to remain here and that her marriage

of the judgment.

be entitled to land as the wife of an
American.
Three years ago the woman, who
was then known as Wooey Ho. arriv
ed at San Francisco from China and
demanded admission to the United
States as the daughter of a Chinese
merchant. The Chinese bureau re
fused to admit her and she appealed
to the United States Supreme Court.
The Supreme Couft decided that the
judgment of deportation should stand.
The woman then surrendered herself
into custody of the United States Mar
shal. Pending deportation she was
released on bail. Last December she
married Chin King Sung, an American
citizen, and sued for a writ of habeas

of an American citizen, she was of the

More than a million dollars' worth of

At midnight the police patrol boxes
all over the city reported absolute

A special Grand Jury will sit next

Telegrams are being received by ne

"If you want any aid from Kansas

When the west end. of the levee was
cleaned out to-day no white man would
work with moving vans and no white
man would accept the goods in storage.
The work had to be. done by colored
men under guard of the militia, and
most of the goods from the dismantled
saloons are piled up in the open yards
of colored people. None could be left
on the premises of white people, who
feared that their own property would
thus be endangered. None of the hard
ware stores is allowed to sell weapons
or ammunition. The infirmaries and
other places of refuge are filled with
aged negroes and women and children.
The mob has at no time shown any
disposition to burn property other than
that on the levee.
At 11 p. m. the militia had dispersed
the crowds in the central part of the
city, but It was feared they would form
elsewhere for later movements. While
there are 15,000 negroes In the city, none
weregseen anywhere to-night. The body
of Dtxon, the negro lynched, was pri
vately interred here to-night. The or
der for saloons to remain closed is ob
served, but no attention Is paid to the
Mayor's proclamation for people to
keep off the streets. It Is thought that
hundreds of "negroes are out In the
woods around the city to-night, as they
cannot be found within the limits. No
women or. children are forced to remain
out over night, as the crowds threaten
only males. There are two or three
among what are called "bad" ne
groes that are said to be wanted by
the crowd, and the negroes fear others
are wanted.
"To the people of Springfield: You
are earnestly requested to. remain off
the streets of the city after nightfall
except in cases where business of ne

to refrain from congregating upon the

"Compliance with the above request
Is deemed to be necessary for the pres

of the community and to prevent a
repetition of acts of mob violence. Any
one found loitering In public places in
violation of this request will be prompt

"CHARLES J. BOWLUS. Mayor."
SPRINGFIELD. Ohio, March 9.â The
situation early to-night was considered
by the authorities to be more threat
ening than at any time since the be
ginning of the present race troubles.
While Governor Herrick has not pro
claimed a state of martial law, such
a condition practically exists in the
downtown districts and the burned por
tions of town formerly occupied by the
negro resorts. Ten companies of the
Ohio National Guard are on picket duty
and seven more companies are expected
here before 10 o'clock. The saloons
without exception have been closed all
afternoon and many other lines of busi
ness have practically ceased.
Mayor Bowlus has not only closed
the remaining negro saloons, hotels and
lodging-houses which are under the
ban c*f the mob, but has ordered the
proprietors in every .instance to move
out all the intoxicating drinks and in
some instances even the fixtures, In
cluding gambling apparatus. At noon
the following proclamation had been
posted and ordered printed in the news
papers:
Of the feminine notables who have
been communicating with the Palace
regarding rooms Is Mrs. Matthew
Baird, who modestly bears the distinc
tion of being the richest woman in Phil
adelphia, a widow of many charming
qualities, who is already within the
boundaries, enjoying midwinter climate
in some part of Southern California.
M. Richards, a millionaire, properly
accredited to Paris, but who has lately
spent much time and money in and
about New York, has telegraphed that
he will probably be-here before the last
week of the month, and a little later
George B. McCagne. who made his mil
lions with the original Carnegie "Forty
five" and is now playing golf on the
links at Pasadena, will be in San Fran
cisco. Along with him will come an
other enthusiastic golfer in the person
of George E. Tenor of Pittsburgr, a man
of magnificent physique, who measures
from heel to scalplock six feet four
inches, and is several times a million
aire.
Still another Pittsburg millionaire
who is coming this way is Henry Buhl,
the great dry goods man, whose name
Is familiar to all women who have
traveled through the Keystone State.
Buhl, like C. G. K. Billings, who has
been visiting the city for several days,
has a strong penchant for fast road
sters and spends a great deal of his
time speeding them over the highways
of his own city. Another of the ex
pected is W. K. Kirby, one of the mag
nates behind the American Car and
Foundry Works of St. Louis.
San Francisco will soon be enjoying
the presence of a number of American
millionaires, driven West by the physi
cal hardships of a frightful winter, the
worst that has been experienced in the
East and the middle West for many
years. They are coming here to under
go a thawing out in the balmy at
mosphere of California, and, according
to their letters and telegrams ad
dressed to the Palace Hotel inquiring
for accommodations, there will be a
large number of them here about the
same time. Among the first of the
wealthy men due here Is Samuel Cup
pies, the widelv known philanthropist
of St. Louis, who is said to be now en
joying the third great fortune he has
accumulated during his business ca
reer. He will be accompanied by his
wife and daughter.
Millionaire Colgate of New York, the
richest soap manufacturer In the
United States, and Charles Council
man of Chicago, whose big fortune is
the result of the profits of his grain
fleet, which was the first to be fitted
out on the great lakes for Europe, are
also coming. A third notable in the
millionaire class is Brewer Adolph
Busch of St. Louis, who not onlv rides
in a private car and generally engages
a dozen rooms for the acommodation
of his family and others who are in
cluded in his periodical journeys from
home, but makes hotel life paradise
like for the bellboy by his frequent
lavish tips. Another distinguished vis
itor will be R. T. Crane, a member of
the big pipe firm, and also known as
the head of the greatest elevator man
ufactory in the country. His son, also
a millionaire, and who recently showed
his ill feeling toward Japan by giving
$10,000 to Russia, because he thought
that the little brown men were not
"acting on the square," expects to join
his parent in California.
Major R. C. Van Vliet and Captain
Frank L. Winn left yesterday for a
trip down the Southern Pacific as far
as Sarpent to try and find a location
for target practice grounds. This mat
ter has been puzzling the officials for
Â£<<me time r>ast 4 but it was thought the
matter had been finally settled when
the site back of Fort Baker was select
ed. The owner of that property, how
ever, put such a hijrh value upon his
place that it made its purchase posi
tively prohibitive, and that idea was
abandoned. A site south from here will
in all probability be selected.
General MacArthur. accompanied by
his aid. Major P. W. West, will inspect
the transport Buford at 10:30 a. m. to
morrow.
The problem field exercise by the
third squadron. Ninth Cavalry, on the
golf links at the Presidio yesterday was
eminently satisfactory to the command
ing officer. The prescribed line of ac
tion was not. exactly carried out as out
lined by Major Bigelow, as he had ex
pected to have three troops act on the
attacking line, whereas he only had
two. The third one was left behind in
.charge of the ambulances and relays,
v.hirh were slow getting into action.
Consequently when he did arrive on the
field and was prepared to make the ad
vance he found himself shy one troop.
In the meantime Captain Young with
his troop, I, had so taken up position
tin the field that they could prevent any
possible advance of Major Bigelow's
forces, and the latter >vere compelled
to retire. The cavalry will have a sim
ilar drill next Wednesday on the same
grounds.
The transport Buford is scheduled to
sail at 12 m.. sharp, to-day provided
the marines due to arrive from Wash
ington, D. C, at 4 a. m. are here. The
following officers go in command of the
marines: Major C. A. Doyen; Captains
J. C. Troadwell, H. O. Bisset, P. S.
Brown, Harry Lee, F. M. Wise and P.
F. Archer; First Lieutenants G. H.
Mather, Charles T. Westcott, Thomas
Holcomb and E. A. Greene; Second
Lieutenants H. C. Egan. C. F. Williams,
N. P. Vulte, H. T. Swain. S. Williams,
F. C. McConnell. T. Howard, R. O. Un
derwood, J. F. Dwyer, R. B. Creecy and
Surgeon J. S. Taylor.
The fire call was entirely unexpect
ed, but the alacrity with which the
troops responded showed that the of
ficers of the Presidio are keeping the
nr>n well drilled and up to the mark.
An alarm of fire threw the post at
the Presidio Into a great state of Â«x
citement yesterday afternoon. Of
ficers and enlisted men at once sprang
from their occupations and rushed to
the engine-house quarters, where the
bugle's shrill call had summoned
them. Captain George P. White, fire
marshal of the post, was one of the
first on the scene of action. From all
Eides poured cavalry, artillery and in
fantry. Each rushed to Its proper po
eition. The court-martial, composed
of high ranking officers of the post,
tv2io were sitting: 'n solemn dignity,
â¢was suddenly dissolved and the of
ficers rushed to their respective posi
tions of duty. Next was raised the
cry, "Where is the fire?" Then it be
came evident from the command of
Colonel Morris, who shouted "Save
the Y. M. C. A. building." that the
clarm v as given as the result of the
orders of Major John P. Wisser, who
Is now making: his annual Inspection
of the post, and wan in reality simply
o. fire drill to test the efficiency of the
corps at the post- The new Babcock
engine was brought out and had a
stream on the supposed blaze two min
utes after the call. Then came the
hosecarts. which were rushed out and
down the hill at an amazing rate of
speed. The hook and ladder truck
followed In a. remarkably short space
of time, ladders were thrown up to
the building- and two heavy streams
were pouring on the supposed flames.
The bucket brigade was then called
into line and buckets were passed with
great alacrity by the colored troop
ers. Occasionally an empty bucket on
the return line would go shy of the
target, the result being close contact
to a trooper's head.

"The only place where uncertainty

as to what to expect from Mr. Hay's
American diplomacy, which in 'these
latter days is so aggressive, so start

propositions to the remainder of the
world, and we have not time to prepare
for the shock. It Is a veritable night

every chancellory in Europe has been
straining every nerve to prevent
namely, the entanglement of an out
side power in this war. That unknown
quantity is your State Department. The
situation following the outbreak of
hostilities was exceedingly delicate and
surcharged with dangerous possibili
ties to the peace of the world, and the
level-headed statesmen of Europe in
stantly co-operated to avert a general
catastrophe, when, almost at theÂ»in
ception. Secretary Hay's circular note
for the neutralization of China almost
defeated them. But, hapily, he did not
press it to a point where differences
were sure to have arisen, and, as it
turned out, owing to the length to
which the powers gave adhesionS to its
principle, it really contributed to the
trend which all desired. The note
might have proved disastrous, did not
the present moment find all Europe
practically in accord as to what should
be done.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 9.â The
misgiving existing in high quarters
here regarding the ultimate aims and
purposes of the foreign policy of the
United States were verified to-day in
the following remarkable statement to
the press from an official source:
"There" can be no doubt that the Hay
note accomplished that very thing, and
the Russians are generous to acknowl
edge it. It may have been sudden, but
it came at the right hour. Perhaps Mr.
Hay had a clearer insight into what
was needed than the European diplo
mats, who professed themselves sur
prised."
The official quoted further that the
Washington authorities-agreed with the
view taken at St. Petersburg that the
outlook was good for confining the hos
tilities to .the two belligerents con
cerned. It has been growing better
every day since Hay first addressed the
powers on the subject of the neutrality
of China and the localizing of hostili
ties. It seemed now that no other pow
er will be brought Into the conflict. In
that Russia would be benefited. If
France Were brought into the war on
the side of Russia, Great Britain would
be sure to follow on the side of Japan,
and Russia would be weaker with both
of these powers so aligned. There seemed
to be no conditions which could arise
which would bring Germany into the
struggle, but if Russia were attacked
by Great Britain there was a strong
impression that public opinion In
France would force that nation into
war on the side of Russia, no matter
how strongly indisposed the Govern
ment might be to risking conclusions.
The prevailing belief now. is that
Great Britain will be able to keep clear
of complications.
"What is thought of the suggestion
made by the. St. /Petersburg statement
that the Hay note really contributed to
the trend for peace ?" was asked.
ed to the note is proof that it' was for
the good of Russia, because both of
these nations are friendly to Russia
and would not give encouragement to
anything ' which could - have embar
rassed her even remotely."
WAR WILL. NOT SPREAD.
"It is puzzling to America to know
just what prompted this statement
from Russia. Perhaps too much im
portance was given it by putting* it on
the cable. It seems to be rather foolish
since the relations between this coun
try and Russia are so friendly and the
tension between the Russian and Amer
ican people is becoming less and less
annoying . because less noticeable.
There never was a moment when the
interests of Russia were threatened by
the note which Mr. Hay addressed to
the powers regarding the neutrality of
China. On the contrary, the interests of
Russia were well served by the sending

remarks of an anonymous Russian of

effect that the diplomacy of Secretary
Hay is a "nightmare" to Europe, be
cause he acts so suddenly that there Is
no time for preparation for the shock,
and that a solution would be easy if
everybody knew what he stood for and
what he intended to do. Secretary Hay
undoubtedly regards the. statement
from the Russian capital as a compli

be so openly recognized. His face has
worn a broad smile to-day whenever
the subject was brought to his atten

OAKLAND, March 9.â Father and

died upon the same day, was the af
fecting and unusual condition that sur
rounded the funeral of Valentine Dah
ler, aged 43 years, and Marguerite
Dahler, aged 10 months, which took
place to-day. Dahler died on Monday
night, and within an hour after his
demise the baby passed away as well,
leaving the widowed mother with one
child to mourn her double loss.
Mr. Dahler was prominent in the Ger
man colony and in several orders, in
cluding the Oakland Verem Eintracht,
the Foresters of America, the Frater
nal Order of Eagles and others. He
had so many friends that it was de
cided to hold the funeral from Germa
nia Hall under the auspices of the
Verein Eintracht, assisted by the other
orders of which he was a member. The
peculiarly sad conditions that surround
ed the double death brought out an
unusual number of those who were
anxious to show for the dead the warm
friendship they had for him in life.
The services were conducted by the
Rev. C. Watson of the German Evan

tribute to the dead father, who lay be

The copy of a second will made by
the late Fabrizlo :Nigro, who died a
few days ago, leaving an estate valued
at about $500,000, was filed for probate
late this afternoon by Attorney Charles
F. Hanlon of San Francisco on behalf
of Francisco Albert! and Domencio A.
Albert!, who are nominated as trustees
of the estate for the purpose of man
aging the same until all the indebted
ness^ has been paid off. Special men
tion is made of a mortgage held by
the Hibernia Bank on the Poodle Dog
restaurant property at Mason and Eddy
streets, San Francisco, which* Nigro
was anxious to have paid off before
the estate should be distributed.
This will was witnessed by Attorney
Charles Hanlon and Dr. Mario A. Rossi.
The original has been lost and the
copy filed Is one that some of the par
ties Interested in the estate haU pre
served. It was made In 1901, while the
one filed a few days ago was made
in November, 1903. Within two months
after he made the second will, . how
ever, Nigro was declared incompetent
to manage his own affairs and it will
be contended that he was not of sound
mind when he made the first one.
If a successfulconteBt can.be made
against the last will the prior one will
then be presented as his real, desire
as to the disposition of his property.
Nigro states in his first will that he
married in 1875, and that since that
time he had not accumulated more than
$2000 by his own exertions, and for this
reason asserts that the' property is his
own individual property. He sat and
watched his estate grow by adding the
interest to the prlnclpal'in the form of
improvements, until it assumed mag
nificent proportions. In this will, with
ah eye to the, economy he had % main
talned throughout his life, he "leaves
j his widow and adopted daughter, Made
leina Gordon, $25 a month each and $50
a year each for clothes. If they should
I decide to live apart, then .they are to
i be allowed what the trustees shall con
| sider proper.' They are eventually, how
; ever, to get the estate the same as
i it is. given .to them in the second will. 1
In; the last V/Ill tl\ere Is no provision
for trustees and mother and, adopted
daughter are appointed executrices and
! share the estate between them.

The Larsen family has been In rather
straitened circumstances since the

that her father's death at this spot
may have had some effect upon her
mind.

Smith had beeri^on the section only
for a few weeks, and started out on his
railroad velocipede to make his regular
inspection through the canyon. He ex
pected to make the trip through the
canyon before the Livermore local could
arrive at Sunol, where he would pass
that train. There were no regular east
bound trains due at that time. Think
ing only of the Livermore train, to
protect which he was making his trip
at that early hour, he did not expect an
engine behind him, while the frequent
and sharp curves in the canyon pre
vented his hearing its approach. Before
Engineer Hahn could 'shut off steam
and before Smith could jump from his
machine the engine struck his veloci
pede and hurled it into the air. Smith
died in a few moments and the body
was removed to Niles, where an in
quest will be held.
Frank Smith, a track repairer for the
Southern Pacific Company, was killed

burglars, who shot John D. O'Brien, a
Call reporter, in San Francisco and
were captured, are the men who plun
dered the California House, Sixth street
and Broadway, several nights ago and
escaped by 'lowering themselves out of
a window by a blanket rope. A mack
intosh was found in a room the pair
occupied and was identified as having
belonged to one of the pair. They have
admitted their guilt. Both men have
been held for trial in San Francisco on
charges of burglary and assault tc
murder.
Though the winter crop of burglaries
and general crime has been late in
Oakland it is none the less disturbing
to the police department, where the rec
ordyof a varied assortment of depreda
tions is swelling daily. * '
The Golden Gate district, which has
been overrun with the burglars and
was the scene of a murderous pistol
shooting at Policeman A. J. Hall by
surprised thugs, keeps to the forefront.
Early this morning a pair of burglars
were heard at work while trying to
break into Mrs. A. Leberge's residence,
5864 Fremont street. Edward Leberge,
IS years old, a son of Mrs. Leberge, waa
aroused by his mother, who had beeu
awakened.
The boy went to a window and saw
two men there. He rushed back to get
a pistol and when the plucky youth re
turned one of the men had gone to a
basement window. Young Leberge
flung open the upstairs window and
began to shoot. Both of the burglars
fled and did not stop to return the flre.
The police were notified to-day about
the occurrence.
Walter Carr, residing at Seventh and
Franklin streets, has reported to th2
police that he was enticed into a cheap
ledging-house at Ninth and Franklin
streets Monday night by two men who
robbed him of $5.

The flames were first discovered in

" fKh Center Strevt. March $.
The- trouble between the journeymen
union butchers and their employers
spread ir.to Berkeley to-day and as' a
result nÂ«ir!y all of the fcurtceii- shops
ia thÂ« citv were more or less affected
by the movement. There was no dis
turbance ot any kind, however, and
but far the empty aypcarance of some
of the shops! r.o one would know that
a struggle between capital an<l labor
was going on. The feature of the day
wa* the renunciation of the union by
the men in two shfps.
In *orrÂ»e of tb^ larger markets some
arrangement!* lor handling ciders had
been made in anticipation <>f a loss of
Â¦workers at the block and on the wagon.
but even so the la^k of xr.^n was a
serious drawback for these places, and
*-ierk& i?r.a nutfldrrs wejersf musierf-il
intu the deliver}' department. The
greatest incunver.ience was suffered by
cuf loineit?, vho in most cases, were
compelled to per.d to the markets ior
their supplies.- _
Five men aurt th<* blocks at Sam
son* market on Shattuck avenue, the
largest in the city. These men were
notified bv the Samson brothers, tlvi
proprietors, that they could not work
for them -and at the same time retain
membership in the. union. The men
had the ult'Tr:ati:m under consideration
from Saturday until to-day, when they
d'Mded to stand with their union.
"The relations between me and th=?
men are verv friendly." said Samson
this afternoon. "Some of them havc
been with me for a long time and I did
not want to lose tlu-m. I gave them
notice Saturday night of my inten
tion to discharge them and to-day they
decided for themselves by withdrawing
from my employ."
Three mÂ»Â»a at the Liberty Market
on Shattuck avenue preferred to re
nounce their union rather than their
employer?. They were presented with
the ultimatum of quitting the union or
their jobs by Fischel & Bauml, their
employers, last Saturday and took it
under consideration until to-day when
they decided to . stand by their jobs.
Two are blockmcn and one a wagon
driver. These defections from the
ranks of the union men are the first
that have occurred in Berkeley.
"The men have been working for me
a long time," said Charles Fischel of
the firm. "zrA decided to stay rather
than take the chances of being locked
but for a Ions time. They settled the
whole thing by withdrawing from the
union."
At the Brighton Market the single
union man working alongside several
non-union men decided to cast his lot
with his present employer?.
Frank Esmond's one union butcher
at North Berkeley decided to stay with
his union and was locked, out. One
man at Pr trick Oleirc's was forced out
for the same reason, ag were also four
men at J. A. Blersch's market on
Dwigbt way. All of the other mar
kets lost one or two men.
OAKLAND, March Â». â Conditions in
th~ butchers' trouble in Oakland have
not, changed greatly. Vincent's "mar
ket, which supports the union, wa?
able to secure a new supply of meat
to-day, and hopes to be able to keep
<yp(n tor a while at least. The shops
that oppose the union are in full oper
ation and claim to be working with
full hands. The delivery of meat has
been resumed. â¢ Â¦ .

"In a case like this, where

chief detective's explanation of his

documents from the office of the pack
ing-house 'fcere brought up to the Cen
tral station, where experts were at once
put to work on them in the belief that
perhaps they might throw some light
upon the mystery of the murder. Cap
tain Martin of the detective force said
last night that this action was taken
purely as a precaution and not because
of any expectation of finding crooked
ness in Brune's accounts.
Yesterday was a quiet day in the
work of the detectives assigned to the
case. The funeral ceremoty and the
preparation for the continuance of the
inquest this morning occupied most of
their time. All the books and other
BRUXE IS COXFIDEXT.
Both young Buttgenbach and I-oujs
Brur.e were greatly affected by the
day's ordeal and when brought back
to police headquarters they looked
worn and haggard. During the long
ride with the detectives they talked
more or less freely of the crime,
Brune answering such questions as
the detectives asked more readily than
did his cell companion at the prison.
The bookkeeper was especially free in
volunteering Information about the
books of the packing-house, which
have been taken to the police head
quarters for. experting.
"The more you examine theca
books," said Brune to Detective Tay
lor, "the more I shall be pleased and
benefited. I had been Mr. Buttgen
bach's bookkeeper for nine years and
I am sure the accounts are correct and
will show that the firm's affairs are all
straight."
Brune complained that In carrying
off th'e books and papers from the of
fice Â«afe some certificates of mining
stock belonging to him personally had
been mixed up with the Buttgenbach
papers. These he referred to several
times, asking the detectives to have
them restored to him. These mining
shares, it Is said, came into his pos
session through the deceased, who
was largely interested in mining com
panies, and Brune's ownership of them
Is mentioned by the friends of the late
packer, who all seem to have the ut
most confidence in the bookkeeper, as
evidence of the trust reposed in him
by the elder Buttgenbach. t . % '
* EXPORTING FIRM'S BOOKS.
During all the exercises at the house,
the church and the cemetery. Albert
Buttgenbach was the personal attend
ant of his mother, who leaned upon
him as the sad procession passed from
the house to the carriages, from these
to the church and again at the place
of burial. The heart-broken woman
seemed to find her only comfort in the
presence of her son. and when he was
led away from her to the carriage oc
cupied by the detectives she broke
down again- weeping passionately and
vehemently reiterating her conviction
that he was' unjustly suspected.
A pathetic scene occurred when the
son of the murdered president of the
Pacific Packing Company met his
mother. The bereaved woman threw
her arms about his neck- weeping hys
terically, and declaring her belief in
his innocence of his, father's and her
husband's blood- A moment was
spent in these protestations, the youth
meanwhile doing his best to comfort
the grief-stricken woman and assure
her that he was not -a parricide. But
the strain was too much for her. Cry-
Ing, "My son. I know you are not your
father's murderer." she eank to the
floor in a fainting spell, which was so
complete a collapse that It was some
minutes before the physicians and at
tendants were able to restore her.
The funeral brought together sev
eral hundred friends and neighbors of
the victim of last Saturday night's
tragedy. After a short service at the
house, conducted by the St. Paulus
Verein, the remains were taken to St.
Boniface's Church, on Golden Gate
avenue, where a solemn requiem mass
was celebrated. The church was filled
to the doors, the audience Including
large delegations from the German
Butchers' Society and other organiza
tions of which the deceased was a
member. After the services at the
church the interment was had at Holy
Cross Cemetery.
Guarded by Detectives Ryan and
Taylor, Albert Buttgenbach and Louis
Brune were yesterday morning per
mitted to attend the funeral of the
murdered Joseph Buttgenbach. The
two young men, one the son and the
other the bookkeeper of the dead man,
were taken from the City Prison,
where they are being held under sus
picion,- to the family home at 314
Steiner street shortly before the cere
mony began and every reasonable lib
erty was allowed by the detec
tives during the sad rites for the de
parted.
Police Sergeant Oreene, who caught
Buttgenbach coming through the par
tition, confirmed this statement by say
ing that not mGre than three or four
minutes passed between the shot and
the arrest of Buttsenbach. In order to
make the arrest the sergeant had been
summoned from the street by the bar
keeper after the latter had heard the
kicking on the partition. Greene saya
the position of the chairs in the office
and of the money on the rear desk
gave support to the theory that the
shooting occurred during a scuffle. It
was apparent, he said, that Buttgen
bach had not been at the desk in the
front office, nor had he been sitting
down at all when the shot was fired.
One of the critical facts in this case
Is the time between the firing of the
shot and the breaking of the saloon
partition by young Buttgenbach and
Louis Brune. Saloonkeeper Heide's
bartender, Fred Moennlch, said last
night that only a few seconds passed
between the two events. -"I was stand
ing behind the bar," hÂ» declared,
"when I heard the shot. Immediately
I rushed out^ to the sidewalk, stopped
there but an instant, and then came
back. Before 1 was at the bar again
I heard some one kicking on the par
tition. It was less than a minute."
TIME OF THE MURDER.
Following this line of reasoning, the
detectives argue that -young Buttgen
bach might have been in collusion with
the two men wÂ«ja Weber saw in
Shipley street. " Hfr might have told
them of the ready money awaiting a
skillful holdup, as his father generally
counted his cash the. last thing before
leaving the office. Believing that Jos
eph Buttgenbach would not 'resist, he
might have expected a. bloodless cap
ture of the money" and later a division
of the spoils. If this wag his reason
ing, the unexpected resistance of. the
packer disappointed it and made the
son an accomplice of murderers. But
the police have much to do if they, are
to convict Albert Buttgenbach, even on
this theory. - . .
Heide saloon seemed too short to cover
what is known to have occurred. Then,
too, that theory hardly accounted for
the finding of the cartridges under the
body of the dying packer. This is ex
plained most satisfactorily on the be
lief that there was a struggle for the
footpad's revolver, during which the
cartridges were dropped. The testi
mony of. the boy, Stephen Slavich, and
other outside witnesses, as well as of
Brune, is that there was such a
struggle between Buttgenbach and one
of his assailants. During this struggle
the fatal shot may easily have^been
fired by the other footpad standing on
the other side of the glass partition.
The result of this reasoning Is at
least J.o give the police a plan of In
vestigation that harmonizes with the
little they really know about the mur
der. The difficulty with their former
hypothesis that young Buttgenbach
himself fired the shot was that the
time known to have elapsed before he
was kicking in the partition at the
FITS THE FACTS.
Hard pressed by the difficulties in
the way of establishing Albert Butt
genbach's guilt as the murderer of his
father, the Dolice are now consider
ing the few known facts in' the case
from another standpoint. This . has
brought them to the most plausible
theory they have yet formed to hold
the young man. In this explanation
of the crime young Buttgenbach ap
pears not as the murderer, but as the
accomplice of the criminals who did
the foul deed. The detectives are
busy fitting his own statements and
those of his friends to this theory.
It will be remembered that Law
rence Weber, brother-in-law of the
man who was (killed and foreman in
his factory, declared that on leaving
the establishment at 1$ o'clock Satur
day, night he saw two young fellows
standing in the darkness of Shipley
street, and, thinking .they were friends
of Albert, who were waiting for him
to come out, left them there and went
home. Ten minutes later, according
to Albert's own story, two footpads
assaulted him at the factory door as
he opened it to go home, one of them
thrusting two revolvers into his face,
while the other struck him a light
blow on the head, saying at the same
time, "Keep quiet, kid." Then he ran
back through the office crying, "Hold
up.'" When asked why he left his
father to battle .with these thugs he
told the Coroner's jury that the elder
Buttgenbach had often said he would
never flffht a hold up, and therefore
believed his father would follow him
-{o a place of safety.^ With these as
sertions of the youth are coupled his
confused explanation of the loss of
his hat and other contradictory jstate
ments made by him. as well aa the
averments of Bookkeeper Brune.
reason for experting the account*.
This process will require several
days, although any glaring discrepan
cies in the accounts might be- discov
ered in time for use upon the hearing
before the Coroner to-day. If the ex
amination should disclose that Brune
is a default^ the discovery would be
accepted by the police as going far to
implicate him in the murder, as fur
nishing a possible motive for wishing
his employer out of the way. Nothing
of this nature, however, had been
discovered ur> to a late hour last
night.

high treason, sentenced to be shot, but
the sentence was commuted to impris

years' imprisonment, and after being
confined in several prisons was sent
to an Australian penal colony, from
which he escaped In 1889. Landing in
the United States, he delivered lectures
In Philadelphia, after which he became

THE reply of Japan to Russia's latest note to the
powers, complaining of the conduct of Japan and
charging specific acts, is a model of conciseness in
statement. The Mikado's men are of the direct schrfol of
diplomats, and don't use two words to say a thing when
one will do. It must be conceded that on the sea of
diplomacy, as on the high seas, the Japanese statesmen
outclass the Russians. The reply to Russia is a complete
traverse and disproof of every charge made. In some
cases, as in the case of the retreat of the Russian Minis
ter from Seoul, documentary evidence proves Russia
guilty of flat lying.
Affairs between the two nations are in the open now.
During the long march of conquest by Russia over the
khanates and Northern Mongolia, the outside world
was not advised of events. ' It is a conquest without a
history. The Cossack left there the same red path that
his cruelty and savagery have left everywhere in the
country of friend and foe", but the 'Tartars were without
means of telling the world what happened and Russia
dare not. She was meeting a nomadic foe, without forts,
arsenals or arms, but .with the spirit of resistance and
lacking the means to make it effective. It is only known
that whole masses 6f, the people disappeared. By what
method may be surmised when we remember the stanv
peding of 5000 Chinese, men, women and children, into
the turbid Amur, to drown while an army of Cossacks
lined the bank and shot or sabered all who tried to es
cape.
From that long march Russia has now emerged into
the light of publicity. She can no longer conceal her
operations from the world. She 'is not strangling the
khanates on the steppes, but / is in conflict with a power
more civilized than she. But her statesmen seem to
think that she can overcome publicity by diplomatic mis
representation." In this she is mistaken, for the most in
telligent nations take the word of Japan in preference.
The Japanese note follows closely, another event, and
both impress the world. The Russian man-of-war that
lay overtime in a Chinese neutral port N and refused to
leave has been disarmed and dismantled rather than go
out and fight! This nauseating exhibition provokes the
contempt of all naval officers. If the Russian ship had
belonged to any other nation, under the same circum
stances, she would have steamed out with her flags fly
ing and fought a whole fleet, though it meant sure de
struction. So gallant old Ccrvera steamed out of Santi
ago with his inefficient ships and gunnejs,'. to sure de
struction, but met it like a brave man and honorable
soldier of the sea. The advantage of this sheep-seaman
s-hip is with Japan, as she puts that ship out of action
without costing her a pound of powder. Russia may re
tain the respect of the world and yet be denied its friend
ship in her Eastern aggressions. But this act goes far
to sacrificing respect.

never dreamed of the sour mine which
was laid, and had Just got â¢well into the

what the effect on me would have been,
but having heard It, I started to laugh.

With a courtesy delicately phrased and evidently ap

So far as the question of time Is con
cerned, it deserves notice that not
merely geology but almost every form
of inquiry into the past throws further
back the limits usually assigned.
Egypt, for instance, is continually fur
nishing fresh proofs of the antiquity
of civilization. Professor. Flinders Pe
trie expounded at Owens College, Man
chester, England, a few days ago the
results of recent explorations at Aby
dos, in Upper Egypt, from which It
appears that the ruins at that one spot
tell a continuous story that carries us
back to 5000 B. C. Abydos was the first
capital of Egypt, and remained for
forty-five centuries the religious cen
ter, the Canterbury of the land, and
there the Egyptian exploration fund
has unearthed the remains of â¢ten suc
cessive temples, one over the other."
From xne age of the first temple a
group- of about 200 objects ha*Â» been
found, . which throw - surprising - light
on the civilization of the First Dynasty.
A part of a large glazed pottery vase
of Mena, the first king of the First
Dynasty, about 4700 B. C, showed "that
even then they were making glaze on
a considerable scale, and also inlaying
it with a second color. The ivory carv
ing was astonishingly fine, a figure of
a King showing a subtlety and power
of expression as good as any work of
later ages." At about 4000 B. C. an
ivory statuette of Cheops, the builder
of the great pyramid, was found, trie
only portrait known to him. Making
every possible allowance for the mar
velous rapidity of art development,
must not many thousands of years
have rolled over between the pristine
dwellers In the Nile Valley and the
men who carved ivory statuettes and
manufactured glazed work inlaid with
second colors? It is a long, long march
from flint implements to the solemn
temple, ivbry statuettes and' human

Sneezing is very common and per
i haps few .people realize how impor
tant it is. In reality a sneeze is one
of the body's great protective devices*
' The air passages of the nose are lined
j by a very delicate and sensitive mem
! brane. This membrane is formed of
â¢ ciliated epitheliall cells, whose millions
; of tiny arms, or cilia, always move with
; peculiar stroke In the direction of _thu
! nostrils any small quantity of dust or
Â¦ other foreign matter which is thrown
I upon the surface.
If, however, the foreign matter be of
greater magnitude than dust, or if it be
very irritant (as snuff, for instance).
1 the movement. of the cilia is too feebie
! to remove it. Then a message is sent
I to headquarters (the spinal cord) of the
I condition of things and the body pro
i ceeds to more drastic measures. A
! powerful message is sent to the muscles
which control the breathing â a message
j so peremptory as sometimes to momen- |
I tarily confuse them. After a few spas
modic movements due to this confusion
I the muscles which expand the chest and
those which increase its depth contract
firmly, causing a great inrush of air â
that is, a deep breath â which is at once
expelled in a violent rush through the
nose, clearing out the offending .par
ticles which were beyond the powers of
the industrious but not very powerful
ciliated cells. .;v_~.
Sometimes the sneeze is due rather to
an increased sensitiveness of the nerves
{ going from the nasal membrane to the
spinal cord than to an Increase in the
j amount or the Irritating properties of
j the foreign matter drawn into the nose.
! In either of these cases the sneeze is
an effort of the body toward self-pres
ervation â in the latter to eject an in â¢
vading substance with which the local
I protectors are- unable to cope, in the
former to secure for the body an in
creased supply of oxygen, and thereby
to relieve the slight congestion which
while present in the nasal membrane
is not confined thereto, but is general
throughout the mucous membrane of
the body. -
If this hint is takenâ if the sneezer
be wise enough to afford his body .the
< oxygen demanded â the congestion is re
lieved. But if he close the window,
move out of the "draft," and thus de
prive himself of jthe oxygen needed to
work off the irritability of the mucous
surfaces producing the sneeze, the con
â¢ gestion is aggravated. The blood re
mains unregenerated and a "cold" may
be the result.
A cough corresponds exactly to a
sneeze, save that the foreign matter
or lhe mucous irritablity is on the
membranes of the throat or "wind
pipe" instead of In the upper air pas
sages, and a cough, like a sneeze, is
one of the body's many beautiful de
vices to preserve its life activities in
tact. The cough may be "cured" by
some nostrum, but such "cures" pro
duce a condition far less desirable
than the cough. "Cough cures" act as
â¢ a rule by reducing the sensibility of
; the nerves which carry th.e alarm to
1 headquarters (the spinal cord). The
cough stops and the -matter, instead
: of being Â¦ coughed away as before, is
allowed to accumulate, . producing
1 complications often of a grave na
ture/ The best cure for a cough is* to
i cough as long as there is anything: to
â¢ cough away.
A young man who succeeds here I

tention of his superiors to his earnest ;
efforts and he may soon be put upon ;

nature of memoranda of facts regard- !
ing public and private corporations i

and prospective bond issues and sales

From these he will probably be ad
vanced to bookkeeping, in which he
has aÂ« wide a range as he would have j
in the bookkeeping department of any j

these experiences he will make a se- j

his work flippantly and Tails to under- j
Ftand anything he does, and he will 1
make another serious mistake if he I
fails to grasp the significance of his ;
Â¦work as a whole, for many a young
man in his intense application to the
â¢work in hand sees only the words
that flow from his pen. He knows the
details of the * -jsiness. but he does
not know it as a whole. â¢
By this time an employer will have
formed a pretty good idea of the
young man's application, honesty and
ability slong. certain lines. The real
test will come to him when he is sent
out to look for business, relying large
ly upon his own resources. ' Perhaps
he will be asked to interest purchas
ers in the bonds of certain municipal
ities. This "brill put to the test the
thoroughness of his education during
his earlier work in the office. A man
\vho sells bonds should know abso
lutely what he is talking about; he
must be familiar with the matter in
hand to the last detail; he must know
what to say and how much to say.
Very often he can say too much. He
should be ready to answer every ques
tion concerning the investment â¢ with
out hesitation and without error. He
must be able to explain and convince
directly from his own knowledge.
If the young man has done nothing
but attend strictly to the duties aa-
Figned him in the office he may find
FomethinR 1 lacking in his presentation
of the subject to a prospective in
vestor. His office work must have
b*en supplemented by study and
thoughtful investigation of the whole
qup^tion of values, securities, interest'
i-ates. commercial conditions and a
vast number of similar subjects, for
the matters that affect the desirabil
ity of a bond as an investment are le
gion. Municipal bonds of perhaps a
Koore or more of cities may be submit
ted in one offering, and the young
man must be able to speak accurately
about many points in connection with
each of these cities â their population,
valuation, the amount and nature of
their various items of public debt, the
value of the cities' public property,
the revenues of their water works and
other proprietary institutions, the
character of their industries, the
amount of business done by their
banks, whether they depend upon ag
riculture or manufacturing- or mining
for their prosperity, what their trans
portation facilities are, of what class
of people their population is com
posed, whether the purpose of the

The business of dealing in bond? has
certain elements in common with a
commercial business, perhaps more
than with general banking. Two pri
mary divisions are' immediately no
ticed in this work â the buying and the
selling departments. In a general way
the qualities that promise success in
cne department wiy give success in
the other, because, at the foundation
of both must be a thorough knowl
edge of every feature of the business
and an instant readiness to take ad
vantage of favorable opportunities.
It often happens, however, that a man
may make a particularly good buyer
and yet not have the qualifications
that Â¦will bring him success in selling.
The first work of a beginner in the
bond business will probably be the
copying of letters, delivery of mail and
running such errands as can be in
trusted to one of his inexperience.
And right here he will have an oppor
tunity of proving his value and fitness
for the work that he may never get
afterward. Intelligent application to
the work in hand, even if it be seem
ingly the most insignificant in the en
tire business, will bring an employer's
appreciative commendation. By at
tentiveness. even in running errands,
a your.g man can learn a great deal of
value to him. He will become- ac
quainted, in a superficial way, of

learn much about the forms of doing
business and acquaint himself with
mechanical details of commercial life.

for granted that a young man who is

curious, because the wooden Indians
were far more distinctive aa signs than
any others to be seen; their Introduction

as in America. There were other fig

by far the most numerous, especially
for the retail tobacconist, who dealt In
all sorts of smokers' goods. Efflgies

by wholesale sellers of leaf tobacco, but
beyond that there was apparently no
distinction. In England the signs were

there was nothing to it. The officer
hailed a passing buggy and ordered the

THE STATE IN* 1903.
THE annual reports of General Ghipman, president
of the State Board of Trade, have become the re
liable year books of California; They present the
only statistics of the entire range? of our production and
export, and are of the highest value.
The State Board of Trade has been in existence seven
teen years, and has been an urgent force in the symmet
rical development of California. When the timid have
flinched at the next step forward, the Board's reports
have overcome doubts of the future by proving the ab
sorbing capacity of the market. Under its encourage
ment we are now finding an outside market for products
that were not thought of as exports before it encour
aged planters, by showing a demand and a market.
Last year our exports of fruits and\fruit products and
vegetables were 8S.084 carloads of 10, tons each. That
was a shipment of 73,404 tons per month, 18,351 per
week, 2621 tons per day, and nearly no tons^per hour
through the whole year, of these products of the soil.
The gain over 1902 was 10,546 carloads, of 'which 7395
were citrus fruits. The citrus export from Northern Cal
ifornia was 2246 carloads, a gain of 598 over 1902.
The repprt notes the fact of the earlier ripening of
Northern California oranges, which extends the orange
season of the State by over two months. The progress
of the fruit to maturity 'depends upon the degree and
daily number of hours of heat which induce it. The
earlier ripening in the Northern California citrus belt is
not accidental or sporadic, but is caused by fixed physi
cal conditions. That belt is on the western slope of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains. The records of temperature
show that the heat is present more hours in a day than in
Southern California, because the Coast Range shuts out
the cold winds from the ocean, excluding both cold and
moiÂ«ture, and the heat lasts from sunrise to sunset.
A given number of hours of heat being required to ma
ture the orange, if the temperature fall at 2 or 3 o'clock
in the afternoon when the trade winds begin blowing, the
thermal day is shortened by an average of four hours in
the afternoon and by at least two hours in the mornjng,
spent in overcoming the chill of the night. This loss in
heat amounts, then, to three months in a year, which is
near the difference between maturity of the orange in our
two citrus belts. The northern belt gets more hours of
heat per day.
This difference is fortunate for both belts and for the
State. Were the temperatures the same in degree and in
hours per day, both crops would be in the, market to
gether and we would be deprived of the advantage of
our long season, the longest in any citrus producing
country in the world. It benefits^ us not only in the
market but in transportation to market. If both belts
came in at once there would be greater difficulty in get
ting cars to take the crop away to the consumer. The
possibilities of the northern citrus belt are great.
Oranges grow in perfection in the canyon of the Merced
River on the Ward ranch, in the . Yosemite National
Park, in sight from Sentinel Dome above the Yosemite
Valley, and on the Loomis ranch in the horseshoe- bend,
of the Merced, away up in the mountains.
General Chipman's report shows that our wine export
has doubled since' 1891, and is steadily increasing. One
subject of great interest is our increasing export of vege
tables. The frosts of Florida have made uncertain a
winter supply from that source. Last year we increased
our vegetable shipment 1705 carloads. This consists of
rhubarb, celery, asparagus, artichokes, green peas, string
beans and salad plants, all of which reach the Atlantic
seaboard in the winter in prime condition and find a
ready market. This trade is capable of indefinite ex^
pension. Our gardens and truck lands in this State pr<Â£
duce crops every day in the year, and the excellence of
our vegetables is well known. Improvements in trans
portation are constant and we expect to see the export
of vegetables equal that of fruits.
The report brings the dairy industry into focus as a
leading interest. The product increased last year $2,212,
596. The total value, of dairy products was $20,436,152,
or greater than the value of wheat. This is due to the
expansion of planting. Alfalfa is taking the
place of wheat and is a factor in the production df beef/
mutton, pork, poultry, and .milk, cheese and butter.
Large as the dairy product, was it hardly supplied do
mestic consumption. There is room for improvement
in the manufacture of cheese. American cheese lost its
foreign market when the dairymen of New York learned
to make butter and cheese out of the same milk. They
put the cream into butter and put lard in its place in the
skim milk. Our lost market was soon taken by Canada,
and the' Dominion has not only held it but has come into
our own market, and Canada cheese is sold in California.
This State seems to have, in alfalfa and other forage
plants, the ideal conditions for fine cheese production.
The way to get a market and hold it is by making full
cream and well ripened cheese, and nothing else.
We have often preached the gospel of commercial
honor. The increasing acreage of alfalfa will soon over
supply our home market for dairy products and we will
export. Cheese is the least perishable form in which
to export milk. A scientific study of methods will re
veal the fact that we can produce here most. of the; high
cheese that is now imported from Europe. Wherever
that production is a question of fermentation only we
can duplicate it. Some .imported cheese, as Roquefort,
gets its quality from a special herbage on which the
cows feed, and that grows in a restricted district. But
experiment may prove that we have special plants here
that will produce special types of Â¦ cheese. The State
Board may be depended upon to take-up cheese pro
duction with^.thc same vigor that characterized it in
It is probable that this report answers more questions
about California than any other publication, and it should
get wide circulation as the Year Book of 1903.
In selling the bonds of a private cor- I
poration one # must know thoroughly the j
history of the company, its earnings, !
its fixed charges, its prospects â in gen- I
eral all the items which go to make up I
a statement of its financial condition. ;
In railroad bonds the features to be!
noted are the amount of business done, j
the mileage, the expense of operation,
gross and net profits and indebtedness, j
Of great importance to the seller of I
bonds is what we may term the trading j
instinct, which is to a large extent aj
natural gift, although it can be devel
oped and even in a measure created.
Some men Â«are very shrewd at bar
gains and can decide instantly whether
there is advantage in a contemplated
transaction. Such an instinct is of im- j
mense value to a man who embarks in j
this business. A shrewd trader will be- i
come familiar with the personality of j
his customers. He will^seek to know :
their peculiarities, their prejudices con- i
cerhlzfe kinds of securities and the
train of reasoning that they invariably
call up when attempting to decide an
investment proposition. He should at- \
tempt to conduct his dealings j
according to ' his customers' ideas j
and methods, and not try to make a j
customer conform to his own. His posi- j
tion in the transaction is to accommo
date the purchaser and give him what j
he wants unless he clearly sees that i
his client is making a grave mistake. I
A complete and minute acquaintance
with a score of investors is of more 1
value to a bond man than casual rela
tions with 600 whom he cannot ap
proach with the same confidence and
personal understanding.
The young man's first work outside
of the office may be in the other line,
howeverâ the buying department. Here
again the trader's instinct is of the j
highest importance, for the purchaser
must be able to recognize good bar
gains and take immediate advantage of
them. Success as a buyer demands an
elaborate knowledge of all the condi
tions that go to make up a successful
seller's equipment. Of course, a deci
sion upon purchases of bonds is left to
the heads of the concern, who are in
possession of an accumulation of in
formation covering years of research
gathered from every possible source
and supplemented from time to time
by personal investigations and reports
of special representatives of the com
pany. Nothing less than an accurate
knowledge of conditions affecting the
stability of an investment covering a
period of many years and brought up
to date will suffice for the safe pur
chase of either municipal or corporation
securities, and it is impossible to place
any limits upon the degree of ability in
this work that can be acquired by a
young man who is determined to reach
the top.

have not only diminished the evil so that some of its
worst phases are no longer tolerated in the kingdom,
but they have even educated the bill posters themselves
into a respect for beauty, and induced them to take steps
to put a stop to the posting 61 ugly and unseemly bills.
A recent report from London says that owing to com
plaints on the part of the public, the Bill Posters' /Asso
ciation has appointed a committee to examine theatrical
and other advertising posters, and to order the removal
of any detail deemed offensive to the eye or calculated
to have an immoral influence. Any poster deemed im
proper by the. committee is photographedfhnd a copy
sent to every bill poster, so that he may be on his guard
and decline to post it. \
The movement has been met with approval from the
public generally, but there is' a good deal of oppdsition.
The London Mail says: "Some theatrical managers,
especially those whose bookings include melodramas,
express indignation at the bill posters constituting them
selves censors in this matter. 'We want the great situ
ations in the. dramas illustrated,' said an irate manager
yesterday, 'and the way in which this is to be done should
jdbt depend on the whim of a committee meeting once a
'month.' The suggestion that startling posters are in
centives to crime is ridiculed, and it is urged that th'ey
simply induce people to go to the theater."
The significant feature in the new movement of the
Bill Posters' Association, is that it was virtually forced
upon them by the growing strength of public sentiment
against the frequent abuses of that form of advertising.
The more intelligent bill posters in. Great Britain have
evidently come to 'the conclusion that they must either
reform their methods or else popular indignation will
put them under stringent governmental"; supervision
such as prevails in France. Our own country, will sooner
or later have to follow the example set in Europe. In
no part of the world is the bill-posting nuisance carried
to a greater excess than with us. Fortunately, popular
sentiment on the subject is already aroused and it is not
improbable that within the near future there will be a
marked diminution of the extent to which the abuse is
practiced and tolerated.

There Is talk that Past Grand Presi
dent Keith' believes that'' she has not
been accorded Justice in her parlor,
and that she may take 5 Bteps* to carry
the matter to the civil courts to re
strain the subordinate parlor from pro
ceeding with the trial until certain ap-
In addition to the charge brought
against Past Grand President Keith,
which is to the effect that she is guilty
of conduct unbecoming * a Native
Daughter by bringing frivolous charges
to harass members, Buena Vista Parlor
has preferred charges against her in
Alta Parlor to the effect that she made
use of language In her argument that
was calculated to .reflect upon certain
members of Buena Vista Parlor. The
officers of Alta Parlor threw out all
charges preferred by the past grand
president and continued the commit
tee that was originally appointed to try
her. ',;Â¦ ,.â -.'
COURTS MAY INTERVENE.
.When the proceedings of the Grand
Parlor that was held' -in Red Bluff
were issued an effort jias made to
have the, report presented to Alta Par
lor compared with the official docu^
ment and allow an arbitration com
mittee of disinterested members to
pass upon it, but this failed. A result
of this was that Past Grand President
Keith presented charges against Julia
Heurbach and. others, who were dele
gates to the Grand Parlor. The law of
the order provides that when charges
are preferred the same shall be re
ferred to a trial committee of five un
prejudiced and unbiased members of
the parlor for trial and determination.
There ls another law that is in the
form of a decision by a grand presi
dent, and which stands as law until
reversed in open Grand Parlor â that
a member under charges is deprived
of all rights until the matter has been
heard and determined.
The appointment of the committee
in Alta Parlor led to a protest on the
ground that the committee was not
selected according to the provisions of
the law, but was composed of mem
bers that are avowedly opposed to the
past president, and this was fol
lowed by a refusal to entertain the
protest Then came charges against
the president of the parlor, the dele
gates to the Grand Parlor for failure
to present their report, within the
statutory time and against the record
ing secretary, and then counter
charges were filed against the com
plainant. This was followed by de
murrers, objections, appeals and pro
tests.
CHARGES ARE PRESENTED.
Following this came another presi
dent, who did many things that her
predecessor did, being moved to do so
by precedent. But her actions, in the
opinion ofÂ«those that supported her
predecessor, were all wrong, and when
told that the one president had not
acted differently than the other the re
ply was, "The other was our friend,
but this one l s not."
This was the starting of trouble that
threatens to disrupt the order.
The particular* trouble that has of
late arrayed members and parlors
against one another is now located in
Alta and Buena Vista parlors. The
matter, under the law of the order,
should be kept within the knowledge
of the parlor in which it exists, but
it has been "the talk of the town" for
weeks, not only among members of
the organization, but among people
that are in no way affiliated with the
order either by ties of kinship to the
members or of friendship for sneh.
In the first named parlor there was
presented a certain "official report,"
to which exception was taken by Past
Grand President Keith, who asked
that it be stricken from the records.
This request was denied. In the mean
time a member of Buena Vista Parlor
vras stricken from the rolls, as she
claims, through prejudice, and in her
endeavor to have herself reinstated
had Past Grand President Keith ap
pear as her attorney.
STARTING OF TROUBLE.
The Order of the Xative Daughters
of the Golden West for many years
kept on growing in members and in
fluence until about three, years ago,
when one of the two factions that have
long been striving for supremacy un
dertook to rule with a high hand, and
in the accomplishment of its .ends
trampled upon the constitution of the
order and assumed that force of power
was superior to that of justice. ' One
of the presidents committed acts that
met with, violent opposition, not only
from individual members, but from
parlors as a whole. There were other
parlors and Individuals, however, that
sustained these acts under the old idea
thaf the president of the Native
Daughters, like a monarch, can do no
wrong. ' .
Internecine war threatens to disrupt
the Order of Nati\*e Daughters of the
Golden West.
There are strong indications that
unless Grand President Stella Flnkel
dey adopts heroic and drastic meas
ures, and puts a stop to wrangling
that Is going on, there will be a seces
sion of many members from the order
and the organization of a new order
under the name of the Daughters of
California. The plans for such an or
ganization, in case it becomes neces
sary to institute it, have already been
worked out and are ready to be adopt
ed at a moment's notice.
A splendid programme has been ar
ranged for the evening. It will con
sist of an overture of national airs by
Allen's Band; songs by Bert Murphy,
David Manlloyd and Eugene E.
O'Sullivan; sleighbell solo by Miss
Nellie Waters; remarks by Chairman
Michael CR6ey, a drill by Company D,
League of the Cross Cadets and a
grand ball.
The committee has decided not to
have an oration at the evening exer
cises to be held at Mechanics' Pavilion.
Michael Casey, chairman, will make a
few remarks and aside from his short
speech there will be no address.
Neither will there be any religious
ceremonies attached to the celebra
tion.
The complete programme for the St.
Patrick's day celebration to be held
in this city was announced last night
at a meeting of the executive com
mittee. The exercises will consist of
athletic sports In the afternoon and a
musical and literary programme, fol
lowed by a dance, in the evening.
The sports will start promptly at 1
o'clock at the Presidio athletic
grounds. Baker and Francisco streets.
They will consist of a hurling match
between the Emerald and Independ
ent teams, 100 ; yard dash, 440-yard
run, mile run, twelve-pound weight
throw, forty-two-pound weight throw
from shoulder, fifty-six-pound weight
throw between legs, running broad
jump; hop, skip and leap and Gaelic
dancing.
The Emerald and Independent hur
ling teams are admittedly the best two
in the United States. They never have
met before and the game will probably
be the most exciting hurling match
ever seen on the Pacific CoaBt. It is
attracting a deal of interest among
admirers of the sport all over the
State.
The other athletic events are im
portant ones and ar.e open to all ama
teurs who wish to compete. The field
day should prove to be one of the best
ever held in this city, as the leading
athletes from the University of Cali
fornia. Stanford University, Lowell;
Lick and Polytechnic high schools, St.
Ignatius Gymnasium, Olympic Club,
Occidental Club and Ariel Rowing
Club have all entered in the various
events and it is expected that St.
Mary's and Santa Clara colleges will
also be represented.
' Among the likely men who will
compete for the gold and silver medals
offered are Bell and Dole of Stanford.
Victor Llgda of the University of Cali
fornia, Robert Cochrane of St. Ignatius
gymnasium, De Manlel and Mandrell
of Lowell High School, Nicholas Bar
ron, a well-known Irish athlete, and
William Mihehan of the Olympic Club.

peals from acts of the parlor's officers
are decided. â¢
As it stands now it is one of the
most complicated cases that has'ever
engaged the attention of the Native
Daughters, and each day partisanship
is growing stronger and more and more
members are becoming arrayed against
one another. Even the parlors in the
Interior are becoming involved In the
matter. Should the verdict be adverse
to Past Grand President Keith and the
penalty be suspension or expulsion it is
probable that there will be a call for a
convention of parlors that are friendly
to her,;for the purpose of organizing a
new order ' . \
Secretary L. M. King of the San
Francisco committee to prepare the fine
show that . San Francisco will make
on its own account at St. Louis says
that there is need for prompt responses
to communications that have been sent
out to merchants, property owners and
capitalists generally in this city ask
ing for support that San Francisco
may make a showing at St. Louis that
may be a credit and first class adver
tisement for San Francisco.
The committee, has received in cash
from citizens something more than
112,000. The 'municipality gives $15,000.
As $50,000 is the minimum sum for do
ing the work at St. Louis well, includ
ing the cost of erecting the building, of
collecting and installing the exhibits
characteristic of this city and of the
maintenance at St. Louis during the
entire term of the exposition, it will
be seen that the San Francisco funds
are still something like $23,000 short.
To induce prompt action. Secretary
King, has sent out a circular letter. to
many citizens, which is in substanceag
follows: ".
From all parts of the world scientists,
and especially horticulturists, will gaze
with fascination on this small collec
tion of beneficial insects. From a small
number tnelr associates in the scale
destroying business have increased to
countless millions. The money tha,J
they have directly saved in rescuing
orchards and the greater service they
have performed in insuring the con
tinuance of fruit industries that must
have totally 'failed without their hard
work can be'Tepresented only In mil
linns of dollars. The insect case was
ready to start overland last night.
By the end of another week prob
ably all the California exhibits, with
the exception of the green fruits to b#j
sent next summer,*will be on the way
to St. Louis. Altogether, so says Sec
retary Willis of the California St. Louis
Commission, the California exhibit will
amount to about forty full carloads.
Something like half a score of cars
have already been dispatched from
California points. The exhibits have
been assembled at San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Stockton, Sacramento and San
Jose as central shipping points.
While there are some tardy parties
who are still holding back under one
pretext or another, practically all the
exhibits are at hand. So near are. the
Commissioners to the end of their work
at this end of the .line that the head
quarters of the commission in the Jluss
House will be closed next Sunday. Sec
retary Willis will' start for St. Louis
on Sunday. Commissioner Filcher will
be detained a few days, possibly to
get the later arriving exhibits under
way and to see that all the business of
the commission in this State is closed
up as far as possible.
The California State building at St.
Louis is ready to receive some of its
intended contents. The great buildings
of the exposition in which the Cali
fornia exhibits are to be placed are
completed and ready for the installa
tion of what is to be put on view for
the admiration of spectators.
FUND IS STILL SHORT."
The exhibition case to go to St. Louis,
illustrative of the successful efforts of
California to fight scales and other in
sect troubles, is fitted up with micro
scope lenses, one lens for each cluster
of beneficial insects. One may look
through the lens and rightly distinguish
the minute insects to which a great
State has, and not vainly^ pinned its
faith. In the exhibition cake are also
thin cylinders of glass, the tubes in
which colonies of beneficial insects are
transported from the headquarters of
the Horticultural Commissioner at the
foot of Market street to infested orch
ards.
Alexander Craw put the finishing
touches yesterday ; on what is pro
nounced by Commissioner J. A. Filchcr
to be the most unique of all the exhibits
that California will send to St. Louis.
It is a case, shiny of exterior, furnished
with shelves: books with showy bind
ings, the .pages of which are ostenta
tiously thrown open to show illustra
tions of California fruits in colors; and
last and most Important, members of
every # family of beneficial Insects that
California has employed to get rid of
its cottony cushion scales, its black
scales, the San Jose scale and all the
other noxious organisms that have, at
different times,- menaced horticulture
generally and in particular the proper
growth in this State of oranges.
.When limbs and twigs, leaves and
fruit have been covered with one dis
figurement or another the State of Cali
fornia has, through the agency of Its
horticultural officers, sought, and hav
ing secured, has propagated vast num
bers of insect killers of insects. Some
have been introduced from Australia
and some from Europe. They are, one
and all, epicures of the firat water.
Each beneficial sort of insect will eat
only one sort of scale. Hence continual
research and minute observation have
been necessary to secure for the several
varieties of scales that have been
brought to California the proper scale
enemies.
Most of the beneficial insects are ex
tremely minute. Some of them, in fact,
are hardly discernible, except under a
microscopic lens. Notwitnstandlng this
every beneficial insect has been en
dowed with a name a foot long and
has had an appetite for scales that has
proved that it could be relied upon to
pay strict attention to business.

Next day it's "I have overworked a bit."
Again it's "because I can't sleep."
You occasionally have a suspicion that coffee causes the troubles and
sometimes really believe you should stop coffee and see if it really does
what some people claim. But the breakfast comes on and the coffee is
there, and "it's so hard to Rive it up."
"If I really thought coffee was hurting me I would quit it, because I
value health above everything, but as long as there's a doubt I keep oa
lysing coffee and yet staring me in the face is the fact that I have
Taken medicines of many kinds.

"Tried various other methods to

"Here I Am"
"Ailing right along and getting slowly a little worse each month."
"Something must be done, for there is but one end to the road I ta
now going."
. - "Oh, rats about the coffee; it don't hurt me. Why, I've drank it for
20 years."
"Experiment to learn the exact truth about it?"Â«
, "Why, of course, I would really like to know definitely and surely all
about it, for I want to find -the demon that keeps me ill, prevents my en-
joyment of health and strength and keeps me from success in business,
because I am half sick all the time."
"How's that? Quit coffee 10 days?"
"Pretty hard to do. neighbor."
"Easy when Postum is served in its place. Why?
Postum coffee when properly brewed (and that's easy) has the deep
seal brown of fine old gov't Java, which changes to a rich golden brown
when cream is added. It does not possess the strong acrid taste of Rio
Coffee, but has the mild, fine crisp flavor of the higher grades of Java and
a fragrance all its own. With many cultivated people it ranks in flivor
above ordinary coffee.
So, it's easy to shift from ordinary coffee* to Postum and make the 10

BUTTE, Mont., March 9.â On the
charge that they were within the lim

the Pennsylvania, were arrested this
evening by County Attorney Breen.
The men In custody say the â¢ Raru*
miners decoyed them into the Rarus
on the plea that some of the Rarus
miners were being suffocated by
smoke and help was â¢ needed. The
Rarus miners claim the Pennsylvania
men invaded their workings to steal
ore and that the- Amalgamated men
were blasting to drive them out of the
workings and threatening to blast.
The Amalgamated claims the ground
where the -trouble occurred was
awarded it by the court. The Penn

the Amalgamated Copper Company,

' Britt wÂ«>nt on the road yesterday
mornirp for a ten-mile stroll at an
easy pace. In the afternoon he drove
to Oakland in a buggy to visit a friend
in a sanitarium there. Upon returning
at 3 o'clock he' donned the gloves with
Frank Rafael, punched the bag and
Flipped the rope. .
"We have just been learning how to
mix up some of the medicine that Mr.'
Corbett doles out to his opponents. I
mean to have a good supply of it on
tap when I meet him. and will do my
best to give him all he can assimilate
of his own prescriptions. If Mr. Cor
bett attempts to use the rough tactics
with 'me that I have seen him use on
others he will probably find he will
h<> checkmated." *Â¦
Young Corbett, the J. Pierpont Mor
fb>n of the prizering, has succeeded In
having Britt agree to still another
change In the division of the purse for
which they are to fight on the 25th ins t.
It was first given out that the purse
would be divided â¬0 per cent to the win
ner and 40 per cent to the loser.
After thinking this over Corbett had
a talk with Britt and convinced him
that aa he was the featherweight cham
pion and was going out of his class he
should be allowed to dictate the terms.
Britt finally agreed to this and Corbett
named his terms. They were that he
was to receive half the purse if he loat
and 60 per cent if he won.
The more the little Denver boxer
thought of this the less he liked It, but
he did not think Britt, would agree to
another change. He sent a friend to
Britt to sound him on the subject 'and
the Californian nearly took his breath
away. Jumping at the suggested terme
as a hungry trout strikes at a highly
colored fly.
Corbett's latest proposition waa .that
the winner take 65 per cent and the
h-ser 35. Under this arrangement he ie
in effect betting 15 per cent of the
purse against 5 per cent, or 3 to 1, that
he will win. Under the previous ar
rangement he would have received 60
per cent If he won and BO per cent if
he lost.
Britt did not rest easy until he saw
Corbett's signature to this latest
amendment to the articles of agree
ment. The incident shows the absolute
confidence each boxer has in his ability
to win the contest.
Corbett has set the sporting wise
acres guessing. His only work yester
day was a long tramp on the road. He
is a firm believer in this as a con
ditioner and keeps as far away from
the gymnasium as possible. This lat
ter work is drudger}' to him and he
avoids it as much as he can. He had
his rigrht hand tied in a handkerchief
yesterday and explained that he had
cut himself slightly. There is an im
pression that he v.ould like the idea to
get abrcEad that he may not be at his
best when he meets Britt so that he
could get a price against his money in
the betting.
Britt and his astute adviser. Spider
Kelly, are daily perfecting the plan of
battle the Californian will hand out
to Young Corbett when the two crack
boxers come together in the ring. They
are as secretive about the tactics as
any Russian or Japanese campaign
board could be. and when going
through the work do so behind closed
doors. The first of these star chamber
mix-ups was held at Britfs training
quarter^ at Croll's Gardens in Ala
meda yesterday afternoon, and if
Jimmy's appearance when he came out
where other persons could see him
Â¦was a true index of his feelings Kel
ly's plans are an inspiration of con
fidence to Britt. When asked what
he hid been doing in the secret cham
ber with the chief of his training staff,
Jimmy said:

Fifth race â Mile and ttf ty yards, four-year-
Hulford, a full brother to Gaviota
and a product of Napa stock farm,
brought a large price as a yearling.
,"Big Bill" Knapp, while he did not
win on Joe Lesser, did manage to
finish among the\flrst ttiree, which is
more than Bonnerdid when, that rid
er piloted the gelding.
Whiskers was probably started to
get weight oft in next year's Burns
handicap.
Barney Schrelber will undoubtedly
bring his crack colt, Pinkerton, up
from Los Angeles to start in the stake
on Saturday.
-. The 'well known owner, Matt Storn,
is still on the sick list.
Amy J will probably be favorite for
the Bell stake to be decided on Sat
urday.
Twenty-two bookmakers made the
required weight yesterday.
Seven strung across the track at the
conclusion of the mile selling number
kept the Judges busy placing the first
three horses. The Fretter, a lukewarm
ZVz to 1 favorite, poked his head in
front at the paddock and kept it there
to the wire, just beating Polonius a
scant head. Outburst ran a close third.
Buxton did not ho so well in the last,
a slx-furlong spin, in which he piloted
the favorite, Hainault. By degrees he
moved up with the brown gelding and
when Mimo and First Chip had shot
their bolt took the lead in the stretch.
Quietly Willie Daly stole up on the out
side with the 15 to 1* shot Ocyrohe and,
outriding Buxton, dropped the despised
one down first by a head. Muresca
wan a starter, but quit badly after
showing a flash of speed.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
FIXISII IS CLOSE.
All three, Pickaway, Fair Lady Anna
and Alice Carey, were played to win
the Introductory sprint, the former
closing a slight favorite. Alice Carey
was bumped at the start and thereafter
Travers displayed as much judgment
as the monkey did when he placed Ifis
head in the lion's mouth. Never much
of a weight packer Pickaway led until
well Into the stretch, where Fair Lady
Anna went to the front, winning clever
ly. Yellowstone was third. -
Willie Daly, on Anirad, favorite for
the seven furlong selling jaunt, scram
bled the eggs to the Queen's taste, and
the Coffey entry never knew he was in
a race. "Big Bill" Knapp hustled Hul
ford. the second choice, away from the
barrier in lively fashion and the brother
to Gaviota made a cathop of it, lead-
Ing Mountebank out nearly three
lengths. Gateway, a' 100 to 1 shot,
owned by Tommy Lottrldge, finished
a good third. Whiskers made a most
indifferent showing. â¢ â¢
"VV. H. Hammond's clever filly, ThÂ«
Mist, captured the two-year-old scram
ble. Ridden again by Jack Martin fhe
was backed down to 9 to 10 at post
time, and taking the lead in the stretch
from George P. McNear downed Arisbt,
the Napa stock farm representative, a
couple of lengths. The latter miss car
ried 111 pounds to the winner's 104, and
met with none too good luck the first
part of the race, Bullman being cut oft
and compelled to drop in behind the
pacemakers. Salabl^ ran a fair third.
THREE ARE PLAYED.
Despite the threatening aspect of
the weather there was 4n excellent at
tendance. Favorites took but two
purses.
The heavy track should have suited
the favorite, too, but there was some
thing radically wrong with his corK
screw underpinning, for after showing
a turn of speed that lasted about as
long as an electric spark he began a
retreat that did not cease until the
next to last position was reached.
Modicum, the Burns handicap win
ner, carrying 104 pounds, a 16 to 1
choice and ridden by Vanderbout,
skedaddled away in front and won
buck jumping at the finish from G-. W.
Trahern. Joe LÂ«sser, on which there
was a steady play, ran a fair third,
not quite twb lengths in advance of
Sailor Knot.
Sidney Bender's corrugated Iron
mud horse, Lord Melbourne, j>laced a

SAN JOSE. March 9. â Judge Tuttle
to-day cited Charles H. Harrison, sec
retary, and William Harper, a member
of the Building Trades Council, to
show cause on Friday next why they
should not be punished for contempt
of court for alleged violation of the
order enjoining Interference with tha
business of the J. F. Parkinson Com
pany of Palo Alto pending the deter
mination of the latter's suit against
the Building Trades Council. The or
der was made upon affidavits of Par
kinson and G. W. Doughty.
In view of the marked Interest dis
played by the members of the Olym
pic Athletic Club in amateur boxing
President William Greer Harrison and
the directors have decided that the
club shall be represented In that de
partment of sport at the St. Louis
Exposition.
The matter was discussed at the
last meeting of the directors and as
sumed shape at ance. The selection
of the men was placed In the . hands
of De Witt Van Court, the club's com
petent boxing instructor. The num
ber to. go has not been determined
upon, as it will depend on the funds
available.
The most prominent candidates are:
Heavy-weightâ Sam Berger.
Light heavy-weightâ Harry Chester.
Middle-weight â George Murray.
Lightweightâ Robert Lundie, Robert Cairns
and Jack McCarthy. .
Special, 125 rounds â W. J. Leonard.
Feather- weight â Willie Dwyer.
Professor Van Court believes these
boys will outclass any of the Eastern
boxers. Of the champions who visit
ed this coast some years since, Scholes.
the Canadian, was the only one who
made a brilliant showing. Dukelow
was a failure, while Rodenbach and
the others did nothing out of the or
dinary.
It is expected a number of Olympic
Club men will time their visit to the
exposition so that they can accom
pany the party. In this way a special
car could easily be filled. The box
ers are delighted with the prospect
and are already In light training. It
is not known yet when- the tourna
ment will be hssld.

"It was at ilrst thought desirable
to have the basin extend westerly to
Illinois street on both sides of Islais
Creek channel, but as the' land on
the north :ide of Islais Creek has been
bargained for by a railroad company
for terminal facilities the plan was
modified to keep the harbor entirely
south of Islais Creek."
The Board of Supervisors was re
quested to repave Dupont street, from
Montgomery avenue to Vallejo street,
at the city's expense.
The City Architect's plans for the
reconstruction of the basement of the
Whittier School were approved.
City Engineer . Grunsky yesterday
transmitted a -communication to the
Board of Work-, stating that the re
port on a plan for a harbor on. the
bay front .of the city at the mouth of
Jslais Creek is not yet ready for trans
mission, although a plan of improve
ment has been practically agreed upon
with the Harbor Commissioners. The
communication says: .
"AUhough the desirable outlines of
the harbor have been fixed to extend
from the water front westerly along
Tulare street to Illinois street, south
erly to Third avenue to Plumas s.treet,
easterly, along Plumas street to
the water front, information Is still
lacking as to whether throughout th'e
entire area of the harbor the depth of
mud is sufficient to make excavation
at a reasonable cost. In the seawall
along the water front an opening suit
ably bridged is to be provided for the
admission of vessels. Should hard
rock be too near the limits of the ba
sin the plans should be suitably modi
fied.
A resolution of intention for the
paving of Clement street, from First
to Fifth avenue, was adopted.
The bids for the paving of Pfeiffer
street, between Stockton and' Dupont,
were rejected and new bids ordered.
The board decided to advertise for
bids for the laying of a conduit by the
Western Union Telegraph Company
from Pine to Montgomery street to
the new Merchants* Exchange build
ing. *i
Wherens, The resignation of Mr. Gruneky
as an official of this city and county has been
thereby rendered necessary; now therefore be it
Resolved. That in accepting his resignation,
to take effect this day, the Board of Public
Â¦Wprks does it with a. sincere, appreciation of
the able work Mr. Grunsky -has "performed
during the past four years as City Engineer
under the new charter â work which will con
tinue to make its. good effects manifest for
years to come â and with the mont cordial
wishes for his further success in the higher
field to which hla abilities have called him.
Schmitz said it was ni>t the intention
to make Woodwai-d the permanent
City Engineer, but it was necessary to
have some one to direct, the important
affairs of the office. Luther Waggon

chance as some who have been men
tioned. :^:^
The Board of Public Works yester
day accepted the resignation of City
Engineer Grunsky, but did not appoint
his successor. . Commissioner Wood

Schmitz to perform the duties of City
Engineer pending the regular ap

iv.troro Xuevo blocks Nos. 306. 307 and

in Petition of Santa Fe
Road for "Industry" Track
\ FAVOR OF FRANCHISE
Policeman Fogarty told Judge Mo
gan of how he had been deceived by
Lawrence Goodwin a few evenings ago
In the Tenderloin. It appeared that
the officer met a lady who had been
indulging rather lavishly in stimulat
ing fluids and he was about; to sum
mon the patrol wagon when Lawrence
Goodwin advanced from the assembled
onlookers and pleaded for the t prison
er'e release, arguing that overnight
imprisonment mlghÂ£ damage her repu
tation and volunteering to escort her
to her home if he were permitted to
do that Samaritan act. Fogarty was
moved by the petition and yielded to
it, but considered it discreet to follow
Lawrence Goodwin nnd his charge un
til they were beyond the boundary of
his beat. Disillusion came quickly to
the confiding officer. After they had
turned a corner Lawrence and the
lady entered a saloon side door and
were partaking of- drinks in a cur
tained apartment^ ' w'nen Fogarty
popped in and arrested the man. It
was the officer's revised opinion that
Lawrence Goodwin intended to rob the
lady and Investigation of the defend
ant's character strengthened that im
pression. â¢
. Lawrence will be sentenced for va
grancy to-day.
Richard Miller, famed along the
Barbary Coast as an agile and graceful
dancer, will be tried for vagrancy be
fore Judge Mogan on March 15. Pa
trolman Nelson made the arrest re
luctantly, realizing the deprivation he
was visiting upon the. terpsichorean
resorts that illume his beat, but he
could not conscientiously Ignore the
fact that Mr. Miller had no visible
means of support.
Richard Clark appeared on crutches
to answer the charge of begging and
Judge Mogan sent him to jail for three
months. He is a helpless cripple and
a confirmed drunkard, and in his case
imprisonment savors of well directed
charity.
Morris Auerbach, who is under sen
tence of three months' imprisonment,
will have his period of incarceration
extended to nine months when he is
haled before Judge Mogan this morn
ing. The police say that Auerbach is
peace-disturbance personified. When
at liberty he wanders all over the city,
leaving a trail of 'unprovoked oral
abuse hurled indiscriminately. Along
the cocktail route he is known and
shunned and even remote suburbs have
felt the lash of his foul tongue. His
last vituperative volley was fired at
an unoffending citizen away out Point
Lobos avenue, and its reward was three
months, prescribed about a week ago.
Since then complaints against him have
been pouring in from all parts of the
city and enough of them have been se
lected to enable the court to tack on
six months additional to-day.
Joseph Hill, Joseph Murray and
Thomas 'Brown, boys,, are accused of
having broken the seal of a freight car
in the Southern Pacific yards, -and
Judge Cabaniss has continued the case
against them until the police have as
certained whether they abstracted any
of the merchandise with which the car
was laden.

Thomas Outwaters was before Judge
Conlan on a charge of plain drunk,
when Mary Wood of 930% Harrison
street requested the court to have the
man examined by the Lunacy Commis
sioners, as she doubted his sanity. This
doubt, she explained, was based upon
t^e fact that he had professed undy
ing love for several young ladies who
dwell with her and that he had been
in the habit of visiting their domicile
at the hour of 4:30 a. m. and loudly
declaring his passion, thus murdering
their sleep and making, as she termed
it, "a regular fool of himself." She
said it would be unjust to Jail the man
for drunkenness until his sanity has
been properly tested, and the Judge
agreed with her.
Three charges of burglary are regis
tered against Louis Novinski and Moses
Levi, whose combined ages would not
exceed two score years, and yesterday
Judge Mogan continued the cases un
til next Saturday, by which time the
police will probably have discovered
additional felonies committed by the
youthful duo. . Â¦ }
The existing complaints against No
vinski and Levi are elgned by Kate
Croney of 1036 Ellis street, whose resi
dence they plundered on January 8;
Lydla Williamson of 1532 'Taylor street,
who suffered by their uninvited visit
to her domicile on January 22, and C.
Blesser of 301 Frederick street, from
whom they stole personal property on
January 24. Since the latter date the
young criminals have presumably been
active, and Western Addition house
holders who have been robbed during
the interim might find something to
their advantage by communicating
with the police.
The Judge did look at him and ap
parently was impressed by what he
saw, for he continued the case.
ering glance at the complainant, she
exclaimed: "Just look at him, Judge.
Ain't he big enough to take care of
himself? Why, he weighs over 200
pounds and prides himself on being a
half-baked prizefighter."
Gus Bernal. barber, 1905 ' Fillmore
street, is large and muscular, while his
wife, Celia, is anything but amazonian
in either inches or weight, although she
has proved possession of a combative
spirit. She; was before Judge Conlan
en a charge of having- assaulted Gue
with an Iron;i)ar, and she smiled dis
dainfully at her .spouse as he told how
she assailed him.
"What did you attack him for?" In-
Quired the Judge. â¢- . /_*Â¦
"Oh, .he makes me tired," was the
lady's reply. Then,- with another with-
â¢ * *
Mrg. Newman, middle aged, and
rather comely, sat in court and silently
wept into a handkerchief while the re
cital of her â¢ cruelty was Jn progress
and the husband and father" sat.be
eide her. He pleaded he had been out
of town several days prior to his ar
rest and did nf* know his child was
111 or had been neglected, and then he
opined that the case was inspired by
a rival boarding-house keeper, who ds
sired to drive him out of business.
"The inspiration of the case has noth
ing whatever to do with the facts which
have been brought out in evidence,"
said the Judge. "It has been pretty
thoroughly proved that your wife was
drunk and absent from home all night,
while her child lay sick and in a most
filthy condition. I find her guilty as
charged and continue your case until
I ascertain jnst how much you are re
sponsible for her offense. Meantime
you would do well to see that your
children are well treated, for I am sat
isfied your wife is not a proper person
to intrust with their care." ; .. .
Secretary "White said he would see to
It that the little ones are not. neglected
until their. father makes provision for
their keeping.
A distressing story of maternal neg
lect of a minor child was unfolded in
Mogan's court, where Thomas Newman
and his wife, Georgie, .were accused by
Secretary White of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children of
having., ill-treated their ' ten-year-old
daughter, Catherine.
The Newmans manage a seamen's
boardjr.g-house at tâ¬ Jackson street,
atidv witnesses ..testified that" both of
them' are. in the habit of drinking to
[excess.- â A -few days ago Secretary
"White received-information which led
'him to vUltthe place and there he saw
the little' g^rlill uith a burning, fever,
while neither -of .her.; parents could be
found; The child lay upon a filthy couch
and was in-an extremely unclean con
dition. Inquiry developed the fact that
the father was at Port Costa and the
mother had been drunk and. absent
from home since the previous day.
After removing the little one to the City
and County Hospital the officer pro
cured warrants and had the parents ar
rested.
Mrs. Lydia Prescott, associate super
intendent of the Pacific Humane So
ciety, appeared before Judge Mogan
and pleaded not guilty to the charge
of stealing a satchel belonging to Mrs.
E." X. Hammond of 230 Montgomery
street, and also waived a jury trial. The
case was set for hearing next Saturday.
Joe Sullivan, accused by Detectives
Ryan and Taylor of having robbed a
traveler of a few dollars at the Third
and Townsend streets railway station,
informed Judge Conlan that he ,was
playing "coon can" in an . O'Farrell
street saloon at the time the alleged
robbery took place, and witnesses were
there to prove the alibi. The court con
fessed ignorance of what constitutes
the game of "'coon can." and after
searching inquiry learned that it is
played with cards. Unless the detec
tives can produce new evidence against
Sullivan he is likely to be dismissed
when the case comes up to-morrow.
Judge Cabaniss dismissed a petty lar
ceny case in which the parties were- P.
Synoplis, inventor of the anti-gout spe
cific, and Drs. B. Gerino and Nelson.
The evidence went to show that the
two medical men visited the laboratory
of Synoplis, at '628 Montgomery street,
and there obtained a vial of the alleged
gout annihilate!-, for which they claim
they paid $1 cash and for which the in
ventor declares they paid nothing. The
Judge did not consider Synoplis' case
thoroughly proven.
The case was continued till Saturday,
by which time the stenographer hopes
to have the kinks taken out of Mr.
Brune's testimony.
A naturalized citizen named Brune,
night clerk oÂ£ the Kearny-street lodg
ing-house in which Stella Smith and
George^Spring assaulted and battered
each other last Sunday morning, con
tributed the comedy element to the
hearing of that celebrated case yester
day In Judge Mogan's court. It was
not the facts stated by Mr. Brune, but
his method of stating them, that light
ened up the gloom of the tribunal. He
ventilated a dialect that would assure
the fortune of any German monologist
who could correctly imitate It, and he
pronounced his words and twisted his
sentences In a way that left his testi
mony in a tangle and the court stenog
rapher in despair.
Mr. Brune opened his discourse by
darkjy hinting he had been "intimated"
by persons who desired that he should
not testify in the case, else he might
cast "aaparagrrass" upon their charac
ter, but he had braved their disap
proval and was there to "exclose the
truth," which- he proceeded to do ac
cording to his light, while the Judge
distractedly endeavored to interpret his
oral flow.
But oral evidence- was not needed to
prove that something had happened to
both Miss Smith and Mr. Spring. Their
faces bore silent testimony to that fact,
and it only remained for the witnesses
to state how the abrasions had been
administered- It was stated. that Stella
blackened both of George's eyes by
planting a straight left punch upon the
bridge of his nose, while with a full
right swing she uprooted a few of his
teeth, and that In retaliation George
struck Stella's forehead with a hammer
and then kicked her downstairs.

Report From Paris* Announces the

STEAMER IS FOUNDERED
AND MANY ARE LOST
Most of the steam schooner owners yester
day decided that In preference to paying over
time wages on the scale demanded by the ma
rine neglneers they would lay up their vessel*
for the present. This means that within a
week or ten days three score of the coasting
craft will be out of commission. The engin
eers say they can afford to wait. They declare
that the laying up of the schooners was pro
grammed four months ago, and while the
engineers' claim 1Â» now- given as the reason
there *.s. as'a matter of fact, they say, no con
nection. The engineers ask , $1 an hour for
overtime work. They place the rate at a
high figure, they say, not because they want
thi mcffiey, but because they hope, by mak
ing It expensive to discourage the practice of
working at ' all hours now In vogue in the
steam schooner serrice. The steam schooner
owners claim that It Is only by keeping their
vessels constantly employed that they can
make them pay. The extra service required of
the engineers Is necessary, they say, but not
Â¦worth the rate of pay demanded, tach side is
firm and for the present the ocean highway
along the coast will be clear of steam schoon
ers w!iile more than a hundred marine en
gineers will either rest or seek employment
where overtime work Is not required, r.^c-

The Glory of the Seas Is too ancient
a structure to do much overland travel
ing. She was built .'thirty-five years
ago, and although well rreserved and
maintained In good condition her oft
calked hull will not withstand many
beachings. No vessel is better known
and. for her age, more highly consid
ered than the Glory of the Seas, and It
was with grave concern that old-timers
heard yesterday that the ship with the
good, old-fashioned name was ashore in
the harbor.
The ship Glory of the Seas, Captain
Pending, which arrived from Lady
emith late Tuesday night, was an
chored too close to the beach off Black
Point, and the ebbing tide left her hard
and fast on the beach. Signals of dis
tress were hoisted at daylight, and the
tug Se^ Rover was dispatched to the
Glory's assistance. Powerful as the
Rover is, the land had a grip on the
ship that all the towboat's tugging
could not loosen, and until high tide
late yesterday afternoon the Glory of
the Seas was a fixture. She was floated
off apparently little worse for her mis
adventure, but will be drydocked for
further inspection after discharging the
31S5 tons of coal with which she is
loaded.
Famous Old Ship Comes in From Ocean With Big Cargo of Xoal and Is
Anchored so That Ebbing Tide Leaves Her Stranded Under the Shadow

The Alaska Packers' Association
yesterday adjusted its differences with
the Alaska Fishermen's Union and a
Bcale of prices has been agreed upon
for the coming season. The settle
ment *of the matter will have a far
reaching effect, as the unions of As
toria. Seattle and Tacoma have prac
tically agreed to abide by the decision
of the San Francisco organization.
Last season the San Francisco
packers of Alaska salmon paid 2\i
cents per flsh to Bristol. Bay fisher
men, allowed them $50 for the trip
north and return and limited each
boat to 1000 flsh daily. This year the
union demanded 3 cents per flsh, an
allowance of $70 fdr the trip and an
increase in the limit to 1200. For a
time the contending interests seemed
to be hopelessly apart, but a com
promise was finally effected yester
day.
Under the terms of the settlement
the fishermen will receive 2^ cents
per fish, $50 allowance money and will
be limited to 1100 flsh daily. The In
crease Is only in the limit, which is
made 100 flsh greater.
The Astoria, Seattle and Tacoma
companies owning canneries Jn the far
north last year were required to give
the men a 1200-flsh limit, but other
wise the agreement was identical with
that entered into locally. Advices re
ceived last night from Astoria con
veyed the information that the pack
ers there were pleased with the an
nouncement of the compromise and
expressed the hope that the same
prices would apply to their canneries.
The settlement is of importance, for
the 'reason that a strike would have
seriously interfered with the Alaska
salmon packing industry at a time
when market conditions are making
gratifying improvements.
DECIDES TO ESTABLISH
. STATION AT HONOLULU
WASHINGTON, March 9. â The con
tested- appointment of General Leon
ard Wood to be major general of the
army was taken up to-day in executive
session of the Senate and after listen
ing to a brief prepared by the late
Senator Hanna, summing up the testi
mony which had been Tglven in the
hearings before, the Committee on
Military Affairs and several affidavits
obtained since the hearing closed, the
Senate adjourned. Senator Foraker
announced that he would move to take
up the case at every possible oppor
tunity. '
Under such heads as the case of E.
G. Rathbone, the veracity of General
Wood, .the Runcie article criticizing
the administration of General Brooke
as Military Governor of Cuba, the con
cession of the Jal. Alal Company to

General Wood's intimacy with and de
fense /of the convict Belaires, General
Brooke's charge that General Wood
was insubordinate, General Wood's
Santiago accounts and the Castenda
case, the brief discussed, the evidence
brought out at the investigation before
the Senate Committee on Military Af
fairs, which is summed up in the open-
Ing paragraph of his argument as fol
lows:-
"The testimony given before the com
mittee has developed point* to which
no answer is attempted /by General
Wood In the various communications
submitted by him prior to his depar
ture for the Philippines, nor can these
communications be accepted as a refu
tation of testimony given by witnesses
under the solemnity of an oath. To
accept them as a controversion of
sworn testimony would brand those
giving such testimony as unworthy of
credence. Among those who would be
thus branded are men In the military
and naval service of the United States.
It is impossible to accept the mere
statement of General Wood, made prior
to . his departure for the Philippines,
and covering only a part of the matter
at issue, in preference to this sworn
evidence. Some of the testimony given
by these witnesses has cast serious re
flection upon the veracity of General
Wood, and It .would appear that neither
he nor the Senate, which Is asked to
confirm his appointment, should rest
content until he has been given oppor
tunity to disprove, specifically and un
der oath, the damaging statements
made on oath concerning his conduct."

Secretary Wilson Arranges to Furnish
Hawaiian Islands With Climate
and Crop Service.
Similar stations have recently been
established by the Government in Porto
Rico and In the Philippines.
Forecaster McAdle has received word
from W. L. Moore, chief of the Weather
Bureau, that Secretary of Agriculture
Wilson has decided to establish a me
teorological observatory at Honolulu.
Robert M. Hardlnge, who has been sec
tion director of Arizona, with head
quarters at Santa Fe, will be placed In
charge of the new station. His work in
Honolulu will commence about the mid
dle of May.
A climate and crop service like that
maintained In this State will be fur
nished to every Important district in
the Hawaiian Islands. It is expected
that the agricultural interests of the
Territory will be greatly benefited by
the innovation. McAdle states that he
will receive a daily report'of the condi
tions of the weather in the islands. Ha
is of the opinion that the new station
will be too far away to furnish much
data in regard to the approach of
storms, but the dally reports are ex
pected to give Interesting information
nevertheless.

LONDON, March 9.â During to
night's session of the House of Com
mons Duncan V. Pirie, Liberal, after
calling attention to the public utter
ances of Chancellor of the Exchequer
Austen Chamberlain and other mem
bers of the Government on the fiscal
question, moved "that this House, not
ing the continued agitation in favor
of protective or preferential tariffs,
which is encouraged by the language
used by certain of his Majesty's Min
isters, deem it necessary to express its
condemnation of any such policy."
PIrie's motion was rejected by 289
votes to 243, and loud opposition cheers
greeted the reduction In the Govern
ment majority. A number of free food
Unionists supported Pirie and some
protectionists abstained from voting.
As an offset to the motion of Pirie.
Premier Balfour put up a Conserva
tive member of the House, John Lloyd
Wharton," to move an amendment
"approving the Ministerial declara
tions of the fiscal policy, as including
neither a general system of protection
nor preference based on the taxation
of foods."
Chamberlainites to the number of
100 held a hurried and informal meet
ing this -evening and a result they
intimated to the Government that un
less the Wharton amendment be with
drawn they would abstain from voting
on the Pirie motion.
As this would almost certainly have
led to the defeat of the Government,
Wharton's" amendment was^ with
drawn.
The incident proves that Premier
Balfour can hold office only by con
sent of the pronounced protectionists.

The close was barely steady and near the low !
point of the day. May closed at 40?tc. July
closed with a net loss of %c at 3&%c.
The 'break in corn prices brought' out liberal
profit taking In provisions. As. a result of the
eelllnr. which wos mainly by 5mall holders /
the market ruled easier, and slight lo*-?s were
made throu-hout the entire list. The earlr
tone was firm in .sympathy with higher price*
at the yards, but the market lucked any
marked support, and prices gradually yielded ;
to the weakness In cralns. May pork clcted

CHICAGO. March 9.â Expectation of a bull
ish Government crop report counterbalanced
to-day in the wheat pit the demoralizing ten
dency of heavy liquidation in coarse grains.
May wheat made a net gain of %c. July is
up **c. Corn lost 2V4c, oats l*j,c and pro
visions eloped 2%$ 10c lower.
Comparatively firm Enrlleh markets, not
withstanding the weakness in Chicago yester
day, caused wheat her* to open with a con
siderable show of strength. May was t;Â©Sj,o
higher et Â»2Â«iÂ«24c. July was up %-5%c at
8S%*rSS%c 'These were the top figures of
the day. Prices were sustained for &. time
near that level by a prediction of a cold wave
extending as Tar south as Nebraska. After
the first installment of buying orders had been
filled, however, the market began to sag grad
ually. The downward tendency was accel
erated by the extreme weakness which de
veloped In coame sralns under heavy liquida
tion. Later the demand Improved and there
was a cessation of oroflt taking. Â¦ The ad
vance was met by heavy -elllng by earlier
buyers, the result being another setback. A
rumor that the Government crop report to be
lflsue-i to-morrow mlcht show a large de
crease In fanners* reserves broueht out con
siderable buying orders late in the day. Shorts
covered freely, forcing up the price of May
end July to about top fltrures. The c!o*e
was firm, with May at 92W>c. July closed
at 88HC
Under wholesale liquidation the corn mar
ket ruled extremely weak, losses of over 3
cents a bushel being experienced in both thÂ«
May and July deliveries. Initial quotation*
in ilr? were ViÂ©*4c higher at 54g5i%c. due.
mainly, to ] the firmness in wheat. Shortly
after the openlncr. however, heavy liquidation
set In. Prices started downward and the bot
tcm was not touched until 60>4c was reached
The clc-lnr was at 51 Uc. July ranged be
tween 4S^c and 51SÂ«|51?ic and closed at
49^c a net less of l%c.

again. The Cheese market is In bad shape.
Butter Is fairly steady, but the warm, wet

alorig now. Humboldt will be sending In liberal
supplies shcrtly. so nobody cares to carry more
Butter than he can help now.
The E*sr market is now steady, as the move

HEATâ There was nothing new East or
abroad, and tKe ground was about covered by
the private Chicago wires of Mitchell. Mulcahy
& Co. as follows: "While it was an Irregular
market, there was less selling pressure from
long Wheat and prices showed more resistance.
Foreign markets did not follow the decline here
of yesterday and Broomhall reports a little
better Contlnertal demand for carroes and the
Argentine strike still In force. The Southwest
Is Â»tlll without rain, althoueh It is predicted.
Primary receipts are again large and the whole
CKsh situation Is slow. The Government esti
mate on farm reserves is expected to-morrow,
and It Is alÂ»o expected It will be bullish. While
we are not particularly strong on Wheat, with
steady cables, dry weather in the Southwest.
ani after a 10c to 15c break we are inclined
to think we should have some reaction. Liquid
ation has been pretty general and the specula
tive situation therefore is less strained."
In this market there was a decline In cash
groin and futures were al?o weak. The ten
dency Is to tell.

The Potato market developed a weaker tone.
as all outside orders wÂ»re about satisfied and
local buyers were confining their operations
to the filling of small ordjers for immediate
wants. Sellers were firm in their views, how
ever, and prices had no further decline. A
steamer falls Â¦ due â¢ from - Oregon to-day with
about 4000 sacks. A carload of Sweets was
marketed at a sharp advance, but did not
clean up. having arrived too late for the regu
lar trade. Onions were steady and unchanged.
Receipts of Asparagus were lighter than oa
the preceding day. but there was quite a quan
tity of carrled-ovcr stock offering, and. despite
a fair demand for shipment, prices were lower.
Bay P^as wers easier under increased receipts.
Prices of the other Vegetables . showed but
slight variation. â¢ Â¦

Custom-house officials here will ask
the Legislature at its coming session
to pass a law declaring Saturday* a
half holiday.
In Massachusetts and some other
States, where Custom-houses are in
operation, Saturday is recognized as a
half holiday and the order of the Sec
retary of the Treasury does not there
fore apply to those localities.
Some time ago Customs Collector
Stratton wrote to the Secretary of the
Treasury protesting against the rule
recently enforced that the Custom
house should remain open daily until
4:30 p. m. Mr. Stratton urged that
for the last twenty-five of thirty years
in this city it had been the custom to
close all the offices at noon on Satur
days, and that In the wholesale busi
ness district in this city Saturday was
always observed as a half holiday.
Assistant Secretary Armstrong re
plied that the rule applied to all Cus
tom-houses in the. United States, ex
cept in places where State or munic
ipal law "provided that Saturday
should be a half holiday'. The new
rule recuires the Custom-house to be
kept open on Saturdays as well as
week days, except during the months
of July, August and September.
Secretary of the Treasury Refuses to
Modify the Recent Ruling Pro
mulgated by Department.

members of the Alcazar company.
Toasts and speeches of congratulation
were made and it was a merry-occa

Deputy Health Officer Louis Levy is
a brother of the bride-to-be.
The wedding will occur in June.
â¢ â¢ â¢
With the announcement of the be
trothal of Miss Anne Levy, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. M. Levy of 1609 La
guna street, to Edward Belasco, comes
the culmination of a childhood ro
mance begun in this city over fifteen
years ago. The bride elect is a beauti
ful girl of the blonde type and since
her debut has been one of the leaders
of the younger society set. She is an
accomplished musician and possesses
a melodious mezzo soprano voice of fine
quality, which has been heard to ad
vantage at many musicales.
MISS. A. LEVY
AND E. BELASCO
ARE ENGAGED
It pointed with pride "to the fact
that the wisdom of Republican finan
cial policies is now so well attested by
the logic or results that the subject
has practically been eliminated from
national politics."
It Indorses the foreign policy of the
party and the recognition of Panama as
a republic.
In State matters the platform pledged
the nominees for Railroad Commission
ers "to a strict enforcement of the rail
road law, to the prevention of discrim
inations, inequalities and extortions in
sales and the provision of adequate
facilities for the increasing freight and
passenger traffic of the State." con
demned the employment by the last
Legislature of a horde of useless at
taches, expressed sympathy with thÂ«
"good roads movement" and urged itsÂ»
importance upon the legislative branch
of the Government. -
The platform adopted congratulated
the party associates in other States
upon "the gratifying harmony which
prevails In the councils of the organi
zation throughout the nation, presag
ing another great victory in the
quadrennial conflict upon which we are
about to enter. And we congratulate
the American people regardless of
party upon the cumulative and con
vincing proofs of the wisdom of Re
publican policies, plainly evidenced for
eight years in unparalleled prosperity,
and in conspicuous contrast with the
preceding four years of dire disaster
which attested the unwisdom of Demo
cratic doctrines in practice."
It expressed pride at being the first
State convention to select delegates to
the national . convention instructed to
vote for "that intrepid soldier, sound
and safe statesman and fearless advo
cate and exemplar of civic righteous
ness, the worthy successor of j the la
mented McKlnley, Theodore Roosevelt."
It paid tribute to "our lamented lead
er, Marcus A. Hanna," and to the late
Dr. Carl Swensson. It pledged the
party not to relax interest In the wel
fare of the soldiers and sailors of the
republic. It asked the national con
vention for a "reaffirmatlon of the good
old policy of protection (bo potent hith
erto in promoting prosperity), with only
such modifications from time to time
as the wisdom of its friends may dlc-

The object of this movement Is to give to
Kansas an honest, patriotic, business-like
State tovernment. Now that the battle Is
over It remains for Mr. Hoch and his asso
ciates to show the people of Kansas that they
not only have the disposition but the ability
to make good the reform promised. .
PMTFORM IS ADOPTED.
LAUDS THE PRESIDENT.
He said In part:
The movement which is responsible for the
WICHITA. Kans.. March 9.â The Re
publican State convention nominated
a State ticket to-night and passed
resolutions strongly indorsing the ad
ministration of President Roosevelt.
The nomination of E. W. Hoch for
Governor was made by acclamation.
In accepting the nomination Hoch said
that he would cherish no resentment
toward those who had differed ' with
him in the preliminary contest and
would go Into the office, if elected,
"bearing.no legacy of grudges from
this preliminary contest." He reviewed
the history of the Republican party,
pointing to its achievements and prais
ing its leader. President Roosevelt.
The Taylor Auditorium was crowded
to its doors when Chairman Morton Al
baugh called the convention to order.
W. R. Stubbs, leader of the anti-ma
chine movement, was made temporary
chairman. He was escorted to the
platform amid applause. He delivered
an address in which he scored the old
machine men and applauded the ef
forts of the party to throw off bossism.
M. F. Tarpey of the Democratic Na
tional. Committee and leader of the
Hearst forces in California, has open
ed headquarters in the Grand Hotel.
The Harbor Commissioners yester
day elected former Registrar of Voters
W. A. Brown as wharfinger to suc
ceed D. C. McGanney, at Washington
street wharf. There is gossip to the
effect that Brown was recommended
by the "organization," whatever that
may mean. The statement is also
made that McGanney is. a Republican
and a capable wharfinger.
There will be a dinner under the
auspices of the Union League, Club of
San Francisco in the Maple room of
the Palace Hotel next Saturday even
ing. Acceptances to the number of 200
are already listed. In a certain sense
the dinner is to be wide open to good
Republicans, as each member of the
league is privileged to invite two
guests. It is expected that campaign
oratory of the best style will enliven
the occasion. Many eloquent speakers
have consented to talk.
It is quite probable that John Jacob
Luchsinger, postmaster of Vallejo, and
George W. Reed of Oakland will be
selected as delegates to represent the
Third Congressional District.
1 Lieutenant Governor >Alden Ander
son, president of the State League of
Republican Clubs, has called for a
meeting of the executive committee of
the league. Arrangements will be made
to-morrow or the next day for the
biennial convention of the organiza
tion. Tt is the general talk that the
Republican State Convention will be
called to meet at Sacramento on
Wednesday, May 18, and that the bi
enniaT meeting of, the Jeague clubs
will take place on Monday and Tues
day, May let and 17.
It Is the Judgment of party leaders
that the several Congressional dis
tricts are invested with authority un
der the call of the national committee
to select their own delegafes. The
primary election law of California,
however, provides how delegates tq all
nominating conventions must be chosen
in the cities of San Francisco, Los An
geles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Jose.
San Diego, Stockton, Alameda, Berke
ley, Fresno, Pasadena and Vallejp.
The law bearing on the subject reads:
"In the year 1904, and every four years
thereafter, a primary election shall be
held in the territory and political sub
division's where the provisions of this
chapter are mandatory or In force, on
the first Tuesday in the month of May,
for the purpose of choosing delegates
to State and district conventions to
select delegates to a national conven
tion."
Intelligence comes from Alameda
County, the home of statesmen ami
the Eden of office holders, that Repub
lican leaders of the Third Congres
sional District have decided to respect
the law. Harmony with a big H per
vades the zone. The story comes that
Congressman Victor H. Metcalf steps
aside to give Governor George C. Par
dee the right. of way as a candidate for
delegate at large. There is a general
impression that the State convention
will not make special haste to select
the holders of high office to represent
the party in the National Convention
at Chicago.
A meeting of the executive commit
tee of the Republican State Committee
will be held to-morrow evening at the
Union League Club. Next Saturday
In Golden Gate Hall at 2 p. m. there
will be -a meeting of the entire State
committee. The* executive body to
morrow night will frame a call for a
State convention of the party to select'
delegates to the National Republican
Convention. Four delegates at large
and two -from each Congressional dis
trict, making a delegation of twenty,
will constitute California's representa
tion in the national convention of
the Republican party. Some questions
touching the confirmation of Congres
sional district delegates may. be dis
cussed at the meeting of the State
committee next Saturday. The call
framed by the executive committee will
doubtless be adopted by the general
committee.

It's a lovely creation of alternating folds of white fluffy qhttton and white

rose bough thick with pretty cream buds and foliago runs around the edg:* and
drops at the back of the hair. It's a hat some one will be proud to wear Easter
